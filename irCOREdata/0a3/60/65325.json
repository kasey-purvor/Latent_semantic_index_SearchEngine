It is argued that the \ntrend towards decentralisation requires a change from a typical \nclient-server meta-model to one based on the idea of \ncommunicating information systems. It is further argued that to \naccomplish this, one must accept the idea of information as \ndynamic and embodied. The meta-model described is then \napplied to a typical existing information systems based on the \nSemantic Web \u2018wedding cake\u2019. \nI. INTRODUCTION \nThe Web is what is termed a disruptive technology. That is, \na technology which causes large changes to the way in which \nsociety operates. This disruption has taken the form of \nincreased openness, and accessibility, of information to all its \nusers. In today\u2019s world, anyone can be a publisher and \nanything can be shared. The Web enables its users to \ncommunicate with an ease which would have been difficult to \nimagine twenty years ago, decentralising and globalising \nknowledge dissemination. \nThis levelling effect of everyone being both consumer and \npublisher is now driving a new wave of user-generated \ncontent; everyone has something to say, and a way of saying it. \nHowever, little work has been done to question the underlying \ntechnologies of the Web. With a massive increase in traffic, \nand an accelerating trend towards user participation, we feel it \nis the right time to ask whether there can be a better model for \nthe Web and what this may look like. \nSimultaneous to the development of the Web, research into \ncognitive science and related disciplines have given us \ninsights into the way in which humans conceptualise and \ncommunicate knowledge about the world. Important ideas \nsuch as embodiment, and forms of reasoning called blending, \nhave provided insights into the nature of human semantics and \ncommunication. Embodiment in particular provides an \ninteresting route to solving the problems that disagreement \npresents. \nThis paper outlines a new, cognitively inspired model for \nthe Web based upon the notion of information processing \nagents communicating active information. The main \ncontributions of the paper are: \n\u2022 The identification of fundamental problem of \ndisagreement and the active nature of information \n(section 2.) \n\u2022 The description of a novel, two-level meta-model for \nthe Web based on the idea of the communication of \nactive information between information processing \nsystems (section 3.) \n\u2022 The application of this model to the description of \ntypical, existing systems along with an explanation of \nthe process of adapting these systems to our meta-\nmodel (section 4.) \nWe finish with a brief survey of the related work in this \narea, especially focusing on the inspirations for our model \n(section 5.) \nII. A WEB OF DISAGREEMENT \nNo matter how hard one may endeavour to convince \nsomeone of something, there will always be those who \ndisagree. It is a desideratum for open systems, such as the \nSemantic Web [1], that they be robust in the face of \nconflicting information. \nCurrent trends in the Web appear to be towards an increase \nin the decentralisation and openness of information creation. \nGrowing technologies such as cooperative tagging systems \nallow their users to annotate resources with short, pithy tags \nwhich are relevant to themselves without enforcing a universal \nvocabulary. This allows users to build up a personal system \nthat facilitates information retrieval as well as allowing \nsearches across all users\u2019 tags. However, the lack of central \ncontrol, whilst useful in many cases, leads to a situation where \ndisagreement becomes rife and there is a lack of quality \ncontrol. \nIt is our contention that, in order to evolve the underlying \nmodel of the Web to cope with disagreement and achieve a \nuseful and stable decentralised information system, we must \nexplicitly model the way in which information itself evolves \nand flows between users. We propose the development of a \nnew model of the Web that explicitly focuses on the way \nhumans communicate and process knowledge, rather than on \nhow machines do. We call this model the Active Web, as its \nkey aspect is the treatment of information as an active entity, \nwhich may alter other information [2]. \nIII. AN ACTIVE INFORMATION SYSTEM META-MODEL \nThe current models of the Web are very passive and static \nthings. By contrast, humans are active and dynamic. All the \ninformation that is on the Web is a product of human action in \nsome form. Now, human conception is not a static thing; we \nare not born with everything we are ever going to know. We \nlearn, we adapt, we make mistakes in our beliefs that we then \nFourth International Conference on Semantics, Knowledge and Grid\n978-0-7695-3401-5\/08 $25.00 \u00a9 2008 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109\/SKG.2008.103\n465\ncorrect. We perform this weighing of evidence and subsequent \nadaptation of belief without noticing. \n It should be clear from this that the assimilation of \ninformation, its understanding and subsequent dissemination, \ncan be seen as a form of process. We learn by acting. We \ncommunicate by acting. Our use of the Web is just a particular \nform of action, allowing us to find parcelled snippets of \nanother\u2019s thoughts. There is no inherent semantics to the \ninformation on the Web, just the meanings we acquire through \nour readings. It is important then that the meanings \ninformation systems acquire are based on the evidence they \nexperience [3][4].  \nThis then is what we propose as the future of the Web; \naccepting the fundamental role that process, particularly \ncommunication, plays in defining meaning. The Web exists to \nenable communication. This entails a number of important \nchanges in perspective. Rather than treating information on \nthe Web as having meaning in and of itself, it only gains its \nmeaning through the interactions of its users, be they machine \nor human, and its embodiment in the world that the users \noccupy. Equally, the desire for openness and decentralization \nentails that we accept disagreement and provide mechanisms \nto deal with it that do not require us to discard information \nunnecessarily. Information is active in that it affects the \nunderstanding of other information.  \nRather than a fundamental distinction between producers \n(the servers) and consumers (the clients), we should treat \nproduction as merely as one outcome of the consumption \nprocess. We propose a Web of communicating agents, with no \na priori distinctions between them, all (at least notionally) \ncommunicating on the same footing using symmetric \nprotocols. This proposal, of a Web of active and \ncommunicated information produced and consumed by active \nagents acting within the dynamic real world, we term the \nActive Web [2]. \nThe Active Web is conceived of as consisting of two \nseparate, yet related levels. The first level is that of inter-agent \ncommunications. Imagine a typical university, such as \nDurham. A typical grouping is a department. Each department \nhas associated with it a number of pieces of information that \ndefine its collective knowledge. These include things like \nresearch notes and course materials but also student \ninformation and administrative forms. This knowledge is the \nshared knowledge of its members, which forms the basis for \nthe communication of information pertaining to the activities \nof the department and its links with other departments. We \nterm such a collection of shared knowledge, a cloud. It has a \ngradual boundary, is dynamic and constantly shifting and may \nmingle with other clouds as they come near. A cloud is the \nfine glue that connects a collection of agents, the matters \nbeing communicated and the agents themselves (as each agent \nhas knowledge regarding the other agents connected by the \ncloud.) We see the Active Web as being glued together by \nthese clouds of knowledge. The exchange of knowledge \nbetween clouds causes them to grow. This increases the \nintersection that may be used as the cultural basis of future \ncommunication. \nThe communication model for the Active Web is based \nupon the notion of active agents transmitting self-contained \nbundles of information with a logic with an evidence-based \nsemantics and instructions for combining such bundles.  \nWe can consider a document as an example of a conceptual \nspace \u2014 that is, an encapsulated bundle of inter-related data \n(information) together with the structure, models and \ninference rules of the language in which the information is \nexpressed (the space\u2019s logic) \u2014 which is sufficient to \ncommunicate a suite of ideas to a community of agents. Such \nconceptual spaces we shall call communicons. A minimal \ncommunicon contains just enough information to convey the \nspace once it is blended with the receiving agents pre-existing \nspaces. Additional information over this is called redundancy. \nA collection of spaces able to be rendered as communicons \nfor a given agent is what we call a knowledge cloud. The \nintuition is that knowledge, as justified belief, is information \nable to be connected to some agent's existing beliefs (the \njustification of a knowledge cloud, or the rheme of the cloud). \nThe product of the spaces in a knowledge cloud is called the \ncloud's topic. \nWe propose to model these conceptual spaces, \ncommunicons, knowledge, and the connections between them \nas institutions [5] \u2014 a construct from category theory. The \nnotion of institutions has already been applied to formal \nspecification languages [6] as well as to cognitive science [7]. \nWe propose to use computational models of these conceptual \nspaces as institutions to provide a formal, yet practical, model \nof the spread and growth of knowledge in the Active Web. \nAs a concrete example, consider the role of a departmental \nsecretary. One may imagine the secretary as a facilitator agent; \ndistributing information and helping other agents forge new \nconnections. As the secretary answers questions, their own \nknowledge grows as they integrate and pass on information. \nBy trying to form new blends by integrating existing \nconceptual spaces, novel knowledge may be formed, causing \ngrowth in the secretary\u2019s cloud and thence those of the other \nagents. \nThe second level is that of the structure of the agents \nthemselves. Each agent is a self-contained, active information \nsystem, taking incoming information, processing it and \nproducing an effect on the world. Rather than assuming that \nall information systems are the same, instead we propose a \nmeta-model which is inspired by research into neurology and \ncognitive science. We call systems that use this meta-model, \ncogs. Each cog consists of a stack of four tiers: an \nembodiment tier, a primary sensory\/motor tier, a secondary \nsensory\/motor tier and an associative tier. All the tiers, apart \nfrom the associative tier, are divided into two modalities; \nsense and action (the \u2018motor\u2019 modality). Information enters \nthe system through the sensory modality and the system acts \nupon this information through the motor modality. \nThe embodiment tier connects the cog to other cogs and to \ninput and output systems in the real world. The sensory \nmodality of the primary tier takes raw information from the \nembodiment tier and extracts relevant data features from it. \nThis is then passed to the secondary tier, which is responsible \n466\nfor organising these features into concepts; in other words, \nturning data into information. The associative tier processes \nthese concepts, in light of past experience, and chooses \nabstract action plans (operators) to invoke. These plans are \ndecomposed into component action features by the motor \nmodality of the secondary tier, and these are thence \ntransformed into execution requests by the primary tier. The \nmotor modality of the embodiment tier then manages the \nconcrete execution of these requests by communicating with \nother cogs, or by carrying out actions upon the world. A \npictorial summary of this architecture is given in Fig. 3, also \nshowing some possible connections between cogs and objects \nin the external environment. \n \nFig. 2. The Cog Meta-model. \nThis architecture bears some similarity to the subsumption \narchitecture [8]. Each tier can embellish the information it \nreceives in order to account for its own concerns, such as \npragmatic impediments to execution.  By providing a common \nmeta-model for active information systems, we intend that \ncommon protocols may be devised for connecting the tiers. \nThis will allow complex, novel information systems to be \nbuilt out of pre-existing parts. \nIn this model the processing and transformational role of \nthe component systems is made explicit. Cogs do not merely \npassively consume information held in relatively static \ndocuments, but rather play an active and essential role in the \ncreation, modification and dissemination of the Web\u2019s \ninformation. \nIV. INTEGRATING EXISTING SYSTEMS \nAn advantage of the Cog meta-model is that it not only \nguides the development of new, active information systems \nbut that it can also incorporate existing information systems; \nin other words, the notion of cogs is an evolution, rather than a \nrevolution in the design of information systems. To \ndemonstrate this, we now describe how systems using existing \nmodels may be transformed into the common meta-model of \ncogs. We focus on one existing sort of system: a Semantic \nWeb application based on the \u2018wedding cake\u2019. This \nreformulation makes explicit the whole processing loop, from \ninformation acquisition through processing to output. Such an \nexplicit treatment of the activeness of the information \nsystem\u2019s embedding in the world is often missing from \nexisting architectures for these systems. It is hoped that by \nhaving a single meta-model capable of describing different, \nexisting styles of system (as well as many systems as yet not \nthought of), the notion of a cog will help integrate the shallow \nand the deep Webs.  \nRecently, data browsers such as Tabulator [9] have come to \nprominence as a means of exploring the links between data in \nthe Giant Global Graph. These systems are based on the \n\u2018wedding cake\u2019 stack of technologies. Whilst the use of this \nstack is fairly well accepted, the architecture does not include \nmuch detail on how its layers are connected. We will see how \nthe Cog meta-model makes such connections more explicit. \nA typical data browser gathers information as the user \nbrowses the Web. The user can then switch to a data view \nwhich allows them to pick nodes and facets to apply in order \nto produce summaries which can be rendered (often using \nXSLT.) The system may apply rules based on the ontological \nclasses in the data graph in order to derive new relationships \nfrom old. \n \nFig. 5. A wedding cake system as a cog. \n \nThis data browser architecture is a straightforward example \nof the Cog meta-model (Fig. 5). The data browser is embodied \nvia its connection to a web-browser through the standard \nnotion of a URI. The input to the sensory modality consists of \nbrowsed pages and requests to view the metadata of a \nparticular object. RDF information is extracted from the pages, \nand the scraped RDF triples are the relevant features of the \ninput. An ontology language, such as OWL, may then be \napplied to classify the nodes and rules can be used to derive \nnew information. A facet description language like Fresnel \n[10] forms abstract output descriptions based on the classes of \nthe nodes which may be rendered to a more concrete form \nusing XSLT which can then be delivered to the user. \nIn contrast to the existing stack approach, the use of the \nCog meta-model makes explicit the flow of information from \ninput to output, and the way that the system as a whole is \nembodied in the world. By making these significant details \nexplicit, it is easier to see how such systems may inter-relate \nwith other systems, which may not use the same technologies \nor be considered to be a Semantic Web application. \nV. RELATED WORK \nIn the information systems community, the most similar \nmeta-model to our one is that developed in [11]. They propose \na model, called the Global System Model, which treats an \ninformation system as consisting of information sources \n467\nlinked to an information processor. There can be many \nsources of input to the system. The processor then consists of \nthree phases: knowledge importation and extraction, \nknowledge abstraction and knowledge integration. Conflicts \nare resolved in the integration phase (much as they must be in \nthe associative tier in the Cog meta-model) and users may \nbrowse the concepts using a hypertext browser. \nThe main differences between our meta-model and the \nGlobal System Model is the explicit separation of the sensory \nand motor modalities and the changes caused by the different \nunderlying philosophy of embodiment. Unlike the Global \nSystem Model, users do not peer in at the top after integration \nis done but rather ask questions which go through the same \nphases of processing as beliefs do. We explicitly discourage \nthe stepping out of the world; the embodiment tier should \nmediate all the system\u2019s interactions with other systems. The \nuse of two modalities will allow us to model the way in which \ninformation reacts with other information, is changed and then \nspread to other systems. \nThe inspiration for the tiered meta-model comes from \nresearch into the modular processing structure of the brain. \nWe believe that machines should adapt to people, rather than \npeople to machines and so feel that generic information \nprocessing should, as far as possible, follow a cognitively \ninspired architecture. [12] described a (symbolic) architecture \nfor mental processing based upon chains of processors which \nsuccessively transform information using innate and learnt \nassociative rules. Pairs of processors communicate over well-\ndefined interfaces which restrict what information is \naccessible to each other. This architecture is in contrast to the \nmodular architecture of [13] where the modules are entirely \nblack boxes. The notion of a limited interface is intended to \nprovide a balance between non-modularity and Fodorian black \nbox modularity. It is at this balance point that we intend our \nown work to sit. \nThe Cog meta-model makes no commitment to the use of a \nsingle processing or representation style across all systems, or \neven throughout a single information system; each tier may be \ncomposed of multiple modules that may be implemented in \nmany ways. It is expected, indeed hoped, that technologies \nsuch as symbolic, soft and sub-symbolic computing may be \ncombined where appropriate to form powerful hybrid \ninformation systems. We believe our work is the first to \nattempt to tackle the ideas of embodiment, information flow \nand the epistemology of communicating systems in a single, \ntechnically feasible model. \nVI. CONCLUSIONS \nIn this paper, we have outlined a new model for Web \nsystems based on communications between active information \nsystems conforming to a particular meta-model. The \nfundamental aspects of our model are based on the \nphilosophical position that the Web is based on the human \nneed to communicate. As such, we\u2019ve taken research into \ncognitive science, both at the neurological and functional \nlevels, as our starting point. \nOur model is divided into two levels, communication and \nprocessing, as a simplifying assumption. The two levels are \nlinked by the notion of embodiment. The philosophical \nposition of embodiment contends that the meaning of \ninformation in an information system comes from how that \nsystem is connected to the world. We believe that by \nmodelling both the processing and communication of \nknowledge, we may build smarter systems. This is not just in \nthe AI sense, but also in the technological. Possible \napplications of this include adaptive telecommunications \narchitectures based on automated analysis of community \nstructures and dynamic caching of data to minimise bandwidth \nconsumption.  \nWe have chosen to focus, for the moment, on the \ndevelopment of the Cog meta-model. This is primarily \nbecause of the necessary dependency relationship between the \ntwo levels of this programme; without the Cogs, we cannot \nbuild the communications layer. However, conversely, one \nneeds to understand the nature of the communications \nbetween Cogs in order to build the Cogs themselves. We have \nchosen the ideas of information flow, and the formal \nrealisation of conceptual blend theory, as the starting point for \nour research into the communications model of the Active \nWeb. We intend to develop the two levels of our model in \nparallel, allowing discoveries in each to inform the other. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Berners-Lee, T., Lassila, O. and Hendler, J.
