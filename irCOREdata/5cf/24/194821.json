We have spectra with good signal to noise (>500 source counts) for all objects down to 0.2-12 keV fluxes of ~5 x 10[superscript -15] erg cm[superscript -2] s[superscript -1] (flux limit of ~6 x 10[superscript -16] erg cm[superscript -2] s[superscript -1] in the 0.5-2 and 2-10 keV bands). At the time of the analysis, we had optical spectroscopic identifications for 60% of the sources, 46 being optical type-1 AGN and 28 optical type-2 AGN. Using a single power law model our sources' average spectral slope hardens at faint 0.5-2 keV fluxes but not at faint 2-10 keV fluxes. We have been able to explain this effect in terms of an increase in X-ray absorption at faint fluxes. We did not find in our data any evidence for the existence of a population of faint intrinsically harder sources. The average spectral slope of our sources is ~1.9, with an intrinsic dispersion of ~0.28. We detected X-ray absorption (F-test significance \u2265 95%) in 37% of the sources, ~10% in type-1 AGN (rest-frame N[subscript H] ~ 1.6 x 10[superscript 21] \u2013 1.2 x 10[superscript 22] cm[superscript -2]) and ~ 77% (rest-frame N[subscript H] ~ 1.5 x 10[superscript 21] -4 x 10[superscript 23] cm[superscript-2]) in type-2 AGN. Using X-ray fluxes corrected for absorption, the fraction of absorbed objects and the absorbing column density distribution did not vary with X-ray flux. Our type-1 and type-2 AGN do not appear to have different continuum shapes, but the distribution of intrinsic (rest-frame) absorbing column densities is different among both classes. A significant fraction of our type-2 AGN (5 out of 28) were found to display no substantial absorption (N[subscript H] < 10[superscript 21] cm[superscript -2]).

Soft excess emission was detected in 18 objects, but only in 9 (including 4 type-1 AGN and 4 type-2 AGN) could we fit this spectral component with a black body model. The measured 0.5-2 keV luminosities of the fitted black body were not significantly different in type-1 and type-2 AGN, although the temperatures of the black body were slightly higher in type-2 AGN (\u2039kT\u203a = 0.26 \u00b1 0.08) than in type-1 AGN (\u2039kT\u203a = 0.09 \u00b1 0.01).

Introduction\nThe extragalactic X-ray background (XRB) at energies\nabove \u223c0.2 keV is made up of the integrated emission from\npoint sources, mostly Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Synthesis\n\u0002 Based on observations obtained with XMM-Newton, an ESA sci-\nence mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by\nESA Member States and NASA.\n\u0002\u0002 Table 8 is only available in electronic form at the CDS via\nanonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via\nhttp:\/\/cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr\/cgi-bin\/qcat?J\/A+A\/444\/79\nmodels of the XRB (e.g. Setti & Woltjer 1989; Gilli et al. 2001;\nUeda et al. 2003), based on unification schemes of AGN, can\nreproduce the spectral shape of the XRB with the superposi-\ntion of a mixture of absorbed and unabsorbed AGN. There\nis much observational evidence supporting the unified model\nof AGN (Antonucci 1993). For example the discovery of large\ncolumns of X-ray absorbing gas in type-2 AGN (Awaki et al.\n1991; Risaliti et al. 1999), and the lack of this absorbing mate-\nrial in type-1 AGN.\nWith the launch of the Chandra and XMM-Newton obser-\nvatories, our knowledge of the nature and cosmic evolution of\nArticle published by EDP Sciences and available at http:\/\/www.edpsciences.org\/aa or http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1051\/0004-6361:20052881\n80 S. Mateos et al.: X-ray spectra LH\nAGN has increased significantly. However the amount of obser-\nvational results that cannot be explained in terms of the unified\nmodel of AGN is also significant. There is a substantial number\nof type-1 AGN for which X-ray absorption has been detected\n(Mittaz et al. 1999; Fiore et al. 2001; Page et al. 2001; Schartel\net al. 2001; Tozzi et al. 2001b; Mainieri et al. 2002; Brusa et al.\n2003; Page et al. 2003; Carrera et al. 2004; Perola et al. 2004;\nMateos et al. 2005), as well as Seyfert 2 galaxies unabsorbed\nin X-rays (Pappa et al. 2001; Panessa et al. 2002; Barcons et al.\n2003; Mateos et al. 2005). The origin of the X-ray absorption\nin type-1 AGN is still not clear. Possible explanations include\ncold gas in the host galaxy.\nFor all these objects their optical and X-ray properties can-\nnot be explained in terms of an orientation effect only.\nIn order to gain insight into these problems and to un-\nderstand better the X-ray emission and cosmic evolution of\nthe AGN that make up most of the XRB, spectral analysis of\nlarge samples of AGN detected in medium and deep X-ray sur-\nveys have been or are being conducted (Mainieri et al. 2002;\nPiconcelli et al. 2002, 2003; Georgantopoulos et al. 2004;\nCaccianiga et al. 2004; Perola et al. 2004; Della Ceca et al.\n2004; Mateos et al. 2005). However, at the moment, only a\nsmall number of these studies have carried out a proper spectral\nanalysis of the spectra of each individual source, and in many\ncases some assumptions had to be made prior to the spectral\nanalysis (frequently on the spectral slope). These studies pro-\nvide observational constrains with large uncertainties.\nThe Lockman Hole field is one of the sky regions best stud-\nied at X-ray wavelengths, because the Galactic absorbing col-\numn density in this direction is minimal (5.7 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122, see\nLockman et al. 1986).\nXMM-Newton has carried out its deepest observation\nin the direction of the Lockman Hole field. These ob-\nservations have allowed us to extract good quality (>500\n0.2\u221212 keV counts) X-ray spectra for objects down\nto 0.2\u221212 keV fluxes of \u223c5 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (the flux limit\nis \u223c6 \u00d7 10\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the 0.5\u22122 and 2\u221210 keV energy\nbands). We have used the XMM-Newton observations in the\nLockman Hole to carry out a detailed analysis of the X-ray\nemission of the 123 brightest objects detected in the field. The\nresults from the analysis of a sample of fainter objects will be\ndescribed in a forthcoming paper.\nUsing a subset of these observations, Hasinger et al. (2001)\npresented the source detection and properties of X-ray sources.\nMainieri et al. (2002) conducted a X-ray spectral analysis of the\nobjects detected in the field. Worsley et al. (2004, 2005) used\nthe total observation of the field to calculate the fraction of un-\nresolved XRB in different energy bands. Finally Streblyanska\net al. (2005) have conducted a detailed study of the Fe K\u03b1 emis-\nsion in the stacked spectra of type-1 and type-2 AGN. They\nfound in their analysis indications for broad relativistic lines in\nboth type-1 and type-2 AGN.\nThis paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2 describes the\nX-ray data that we used for the analysis; Sect. 3 describes how\nwe built our sample of objects; Sect. 4 explains how the time\naveraged spectra were extracted for each individual object; in\nSect. 5 we show the current status of the optical identifica-\ntion process; Sect. 6 describes the models that we used to fit\nthe X-ray emission of our sources; we show the results of the\nanalysis in Sects. 7\u22129; the dependence of spectral parameters\nwith luminosity and redshift is show in Sect. 10; in Sect. 11\nwe discuss possible explanations for the lack of X-ray absorp-\ntion signatures found in the spectra of five of the sources in our\nsample of type-2 AGN; in Sect. 12 we compare the integrated\nemission of our sources with the cosmic X-ray background in\nthe 2\u22127 keV band; the results of our analysis are summarised\nin Sect. 13.\nThroughout this paper we have adopted the WMAP derived\ncosmology with H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121, \u2126M = 0.3 and \u2126\u039b =\n0.7. All errors are computed with a delta chi-square of 2.706,\nequivalent to 90% confidence region for a single parameter.\n2. XMM-Newton observations\nThe deepest XMM-Newton observation has been carried out in\nthe direction of the Lockman Hole field, that is centred on the\nsky position RA: 10:52:43 and Dec: +57:28:48 (J2000). The\ndata were obtained by adding 17 XMM-Newton observations\nobtained from 2000 to 2002. A summary of the observations\nused in this analysis is given in Table 1. The Lockman Hole was\nalso observed during revolution 071, however at the time of this\nanalysis there was no Observation Data File (ODF) available,\nand hence, we could not reprocess the data. The first column\nin Table 1 shows the revolution number and observation iden-\ntifier. The second column shows the phase of the observation\n(i.e. PV for observations during the EPIC-Payload Verification\nPhase, and AO1 and AO2 for observations during the first and\nsecond Announcement of Opportunity). The third and fourth\ncolumns list the coordinates of the field used for each obser-\nvation. The next column lists the observation dates and the\nlast three columns show the filters that were used during each\nobservation for each X-ray detector together with the expo-\nsure times after removal of periods of high background. The\n17 XMM-Newton observations gave a total exposure (after re-\nmoval of periods of high background) of \u223c850 ks for MOS1\nand MOS2 detectors and \u223c650 ks for pn. Some AO2 observa-\ntions have an offset of more than \u223c25 arcmin with respect to\nthe other observations. Because of this offset between observa-\ntions, the total exposure time in the centre of the Lockman Hole\nfield was reduced significantly, however, the total solid angle\ncovered by the observations increased substantially. The solid\nangle of the observation as a function of the effective exposure\ntime1 is plotted in Fig. 1.\n3. X-ray source list\nWe have used the XMM-Newton Science Analysis Software\n(SAS, Gabriel et al. 2004) version v5.4, the latest public ver-\nsion of the SAS at the time of study, to analyse the X-ray ob-\nservations. Spurious noise events not created by X-rays were\n1 The solid angle for a value of t was obtained by summing the num-\nber of pixels in M1, M2 and pn exposure maps of the total observation\nwith a value \u2265t. Because the exposure maps include the energy depen-\ndent mirror vignetting function, the solid angle is given as a function\nof the effective exposure time on each camera.\nS.

Solid angle(\u2126 (t)) covered by MOS1, MOS2 and pn detectors\nas a function of the effective exposure time (after removal of back-\nground flares) in the 0.5\u22122 keV band. \u2126 (t) is the solid angle (in deg2)\nin the 0.5\u22122 keV exposure map of each EPIC camera with an expo-\nsure \u2265 t.\nfiltered from the event files using the XMM-Newton pipeline\nstandard filtering. We have cleaned the event files of the indi-\nvidual observations with periods of high background due to soft\nhigh background flares. For each observation and detector we\nbuilt light curves (histograms of counts as a function of time).\nThe light curves were visually inspected to search for time in-\ntervals affected by high flaring background periods. Thresholds\nin count rate were determined separately for each observation\nand camera.\nEvents covering patterns 0\u221212 for MOS and 0\u22124 for\npn data were selected.\nCleaned event files were used to create images, background\nmaps and exposure maps for each detector and for each of the\nXMM-Newton standard energy bands (0.2\u22120.5, 0.5\u22122, 2\u22124.5,\n4.5\u22127.5 and 7.5\u221212 keV). We have run the XMM-Newton\nsource detection algorithm, eboxdetect-emldetect, simul-\ntaneously in the five energy bands. Our motivation was to reach\nthe maximum sensitivity in each individual band in order to\nbest detect objects with spectra peaking at different energies (as\nit is the case for AGN with different absorbing column densi-\nties). However, it is important to note that the sensitivity of the\nXMM-Newton X-ray detectors is a strong function of energy,\nwith the maximum sensitivity reached between 0.5 and 4.5 keV.\nThis implies that we will best detect objects with X-ray spectra\npeaking within this interval of energy.\nDue to the large offset between different observations of\nthe field (see Sect. 2), we did not merge the event files, because\nin the merging process important information from the indi-\nvidual observations is lost (e.g., bad columns in the detectors).\nMoreover, it is not possible to create exposure maps or back-\nground maps from the merged event files. Therefore we ex-\ntracted images, exposure maps and background maps, for each\nindividual observation, detector and energy band, and then, we\ncombined them to obtain the total observation of the field for\neach X-ray detector and energy band.\nWe decided to run the source detection algorithm indepen-\ndently for each detector. Because the pn data give the deepest\nobservation of the field (the MOS1 and MOS2 detectors only\nreceive about half of the radiation from the X-ray telescopes,\nthe other half goes to the Reflection Grating Spectrometers),\n82 S. Mateos et al.: X-ray spectra LH\nwe used the pn source list to build our catalogue of sources.\nHowever, we cross-correlated the sources detected with the pn\nwith the ones detected with each MOS detector. We found that\nonly one faint object that was detected with the MOS1 and\nMOS2 detectors was not detected with the pn (probably be-\ncause it was very close to a brighter object). We added this ob-\nject to our source list. We have carried out a visual screening of\nthe objects to remove spurious detections (e.g. we have detec-\ntions in hot pixels that were still present in the data). The final\nnumber of objects detected after visual screening in the inte-\ngrated XMM-Newton observation of the Lockman Hole is 268.\nIn this paper we show the results obtained from the spec-\ntral analysis of the 123 sources with the best spectral quality\n(more than 500 MOS+pn background subtracted counts in the\n0.2\u221212 keV band). Because we were interested in studying the\nX-ray spectral properties of AGN, we excluded from the sam-\nple the objects identified as clusters of galaxies or stars. The re-\nsults from the analysis of the fainter objects will be presented in\na forthcoming paper. Figure 2 shows the distribution of (back-\nground subtracted) counts for the sources that we have studied.\nIn the following we will refer to the sample of 123 brightest\nsources as our list of objects.\nIn order to allow comparison with previous surveys con-\nducted in the soft, 0.5\u22122 keV, and hard, 2\u221210 keV, bands,\nwe have checked whether our objects were detected in any\nof these bands. We have the likelihoods of detection for the\nsoft band, because it was one of the energy bands used for the\nsource detection. We have calculated the likelihoods in the hard\n(2\u221210 keV) band, combining2 the ones obtained in the bands\n2\u22124.5 keV, 4.5\u22127.5 keV and 7.5\u221212 keV. Indeed, the combina-\ntion of these values will give us the detection likelihood in band\n2\u221212 keV. However, the effective area of the X-ray telescopes\ndecreases rapidly at energies above 5 keV, hence we do not\nexpect the value of the detection likelihood in the 2\u221212 keV\nband to differ substantially from the value in the 2\u221210 keV\nband. By selecting sources with 0.5\u22122 and 2\u221210 keV detec-\ntion likelihoods above 10 we found that the number of objects\ndetected in both the soft and hard bands was 117 (out of 123).\nThree objects were only detected in the hard band and three\nonly in the soft band. These numbers indicate that the source\npopulation that we are studying is detected in both bands, and\ntherefore our list of sources does not differ significantly from\nwhat would have been detected in a hard or soft band survey at\nsimilar fluxes.\n4. X-ray spectral products\nAn automated procedure has been used to obtain for each in-\ndividual object the spectrum of the total observation, here-\nafter, the time averaged spectrum of the sources. In addition\na background spectrum and a response calibration matrix have\nbeen generated by combining individual products from each\nexposure.\n2 Detection likelihoods in the 2\u221210 keV band were obtained\nfollowing the description of the emldetect task, see\nhttp:\/\/xmm.vilspa.esa.es\/external\/xmm_sw_cal\/\nsas_frame.shtml\nFig. 2. Distribution of the number of background-subtracted counts in\nthe 0.2\u221212 keV spectra for the sources in our sample. We used the\ncounts of the time averaged spectra with better signal to noise (MOS\nor pn).\nFirst we have extracted the spectra of each object for each\ndetector (MOS1, MOS2 and pn) and observation. We used the\ncoordinates of the objects, RA and Dec, that we obtained from\nthe source detection process, and the SAS task region to de-\nfine the source and background extraction regions. The first\nwas defined as a circle with a radius (rs) that varied depend-\ning on the position of the source within the detector. We ex-\ntracted the background for each object in an annulus centred\non the source position, with inner radius rs and outer radius\n3 \u00d7 rs. The task region checks the source and background\nregions for overlap with neighbouring sources. If overlapping\nexists, then, the size of the source region is reduced until it is\nremoved. For the background regions, if neighbouring objects\nfall inside the background region they are masked out. The task\nregion also checks that the extraction regions do not extend\noutside the edges of the field of view. The radius of extrac-\ntion of spectra varies from source to source, but typically was\n\u223c14\u221220 arcsec. Once the regions were defined, we used the\nSAS task evselect to extract from event files the spectra of\neach object. Calibration matrices (arf and rmf) for each spec-\ntrum were obtained with the SAS tasks arfgen and rmfgen.\nWe did not use the spectra from observations where the ob-\njects were near the borders of the FOV, or near CCD gaps or\nbad columns, because in these cases we found that the spectral\nproducts, in particular the response matrices were often incor-\nrect. To find and remove these cases we visually checked the\nimages of each observation and detector.\nWe have obtained a MOS and pn time averaged spectra for\neach object. As we see in Table 1, different filters were used\nfor the observations. The filters affect in a different way the\nX-ray spectra at low energies. To take into account this effect\nwhen combining the spectral products of each source, we have\nweighted the data of each individual observation with the ex-\nposure time of the observation3.\n3 Source and background spectra are obtained adding the counts for\neach channel. The areas used to extract the spectra and the response\nmatrices were weighted with the exposure times of each individual\nobservation.\nS. Mateos et al.: X-ray spectra LH 83\nThe spectra were extracted in the energy range from 0.2\nto 12 keV, where the X-ray detectors are best calibrated. In or-\nder to use the \u03c72 minimisation during the spectral fitting, we\nhave grouped the spectra with a minimum number of 30 counts\nper bin.\n5. Optical identifications\nA large fraction of the X-ray sources that were detected with\nthe ROSAT satellite in the Lockman Hole have already been\nidentified through optical spectroscopy (Schmidt et al. 1998;\nLehmann et al. 2001). These sources were detected in the\n0.5\u22122 keV energy range, and therefore the optical identification\nis expected to be biased against absorbed sources, whose X-ray\nspectra does not peak in the ROSAT energy interval. However,\nthe optical identifications go as deep as R \u223c 24, hence we do\nnot expect the identifications in our sample to be significantly\naffected by the bias against absorbed sources.\nOur XMM-Newton observations cover a larger solid angle\nthan the ROSAT observations and find additional sources due\nto the superb high energy response of the XMM-Newton detec-\ntors. Some of the objects that we have analysed fall outside the\nsolid angle covered by ROSAT and we do not have optical iden-\ntifications. Other sources were not detected with ROSAT. For 8\nof these newly detected XMM-Newton sources optical spectra\nhave been obtained with the LRIS and Deimos instruments at\nthe Keck telescopes in 2001, 2003, and 2004 (PI: M. Schmidt\nand P. Henry). The spectroscopic identification of these objects\nand of the entire Deep XMM-Newton Survey in the Lockman\nHole will be presented in a forthcoming paper (Szokoly et al.\n2006, in preparation).\nTo be consistent with the ROSAT identifications we have\nused the same criteria to differentiate between type-1 and\ntype-2 AGN as described in detail by Schmidt et al. (1998).\nSources were classified depending on the properties of their\nUV\/optical emission lines. Objects with UV\/optical emission\nlines with FWHM > 1500 km s\u22121 in their optical spectra were\nclassified as type-1 AGN. Sources that do not exhibit broad\nemission lines but that show Ne emission lines ([Ne V] and\/or\nstrong [Ne III]) were classified as type-2 AGN. Classification\nof Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1) was only possible\nfor bright nearby objects. Hence, we cannot be sure that the\noptical classification criteria used to separate the type-1 and\ntype-2 AGN in our sample has excluded all NLSy1 from the\nsample of type-2 AGN. However, based on the observed X-ray\nproperties of our sources, we do not expect this to affect the\nresults of our study.\nAt the time of this analysis, 74 (\u223c60%) of the sources had\noptical spectroscopic identifications. Of these, 46 were classi-\nfied as type-1 AGN and 28 as type-2 AGN.\nIn Fig. 3 we show the distribution in 0.2\u221212 keV flux4 of\nall the objects (solid histogram) and of the identified sources\n(dot-dash histogram). We see that the two distributions agree\n4 Fluxes were obtained from the objects best fit model (see Sect. 9).\nFig. 3. Histograms of 0.2\u221212 keV fluxes for the whole sample of\nsources analysed and for the objects with optical identifications. The\nfluxes were obtained from the sources best fit model (see Sect. 9).\nquite well, i.e., the identified sources do not tend to have higher\nX-ray fluxes.\n6. X-ray spectral fitting\nWe have used the xspec 11.3.0 package to fit the X-ray spec-\ntra of our objects. MOS and pn spectra were fitted simultane-\nously and with the same spectral model, including normalisa-\ntion. At the time of our analysis it was found that there was\nan offset of \u223c1 arcmin between the optical axis of the three\nEPIC instruments and the values in the calibration files (CCF)5.\nThis could be introducing discrepancies in the fluxes measured\nby the MOS and pn due to an incorrect vignetting correction.\nThese flux discrepancies could be as high as \u00b114%. However,\nwe did not find a significant improvement in the quality of\nour fits when different normalisations were used to fit MOS\nand pn spectra. For the objects where we found an offset be-\ntween MOS and pn normalisations, this offset was much higher\nthan the expected flux discrepancies explained before. We in-\nterpreted this effect as a change in the flux of the source during\nthe observations (note that the time averaged spectra of MOS\nand pn in the majority of the cases were not necessary built\nwith the same set of observations, because the FOV and the po-\nsitions of the gaps are different for MOS and pn, and in different\nobservations).\nIn order to compare the results of our analysis with other\nstudies of data with lower signal to noise, we have fitted the\nspectra of our sources with a single power law model (here-\nafter SPL). This has allowed us to study in more detail the ori-\ngin of the hardening of the average spectra of AGN with the\nsoft X-ray flux (see e.g. Mateos et al 2005), and investigate if\nthe same effect is also present when 2\u221210 keV fluxes are used.\nTo study the effect of absorption in the results obtained with\nthe SPL we fitted all the spectra with an absorbed power law\nmodel (hereafter APL model).\n5 http:\/\/xmm.vilspa.esa.es\/docs\/documents\/\nCAL-SRN-0156-1-3.eps.gz\n84 S. Mateos et al.: X-ray spectra LH\nFig. 4. Dependence of \u0393 with soft (0.5\u22122 keV) and hard (2\u221210 keV) flux when all spectra are fitted with a single power law model. In plots a)\nand b) we show the dependence of the weighted (with the error of each individual value) \u0393 with the flux. The bins in flux were defined in order\nto have the same number of sources per bin. In plots c) and d) we show the values of \u0393 obtained for each individual source. The dash-dot lines\nin these plots show, for an exposure time of 280 ks, the limit in flux for detection for an object as a function of \u0393 (see Sect. 7.1 for details).\nErrors bars in c) and d) correspond to 90% confidence.\nUsing these two models it is possible to obtain very use-\nful results on the average spectral properties of our sources,\nthe broad band continuum shape and the X-ray absorption.\nHowever, our major goal is to study in detail the 0.2\u221212 keV\nX-ray emission of each individual source. Hence, for each ob-\nject we have obtained its best fit model. The quality of our data\nhas allowed us to search for soft excess at low energies, the\nFe K\u03b1 emission line complex, and reflection components.\nWe have used the F-test to measure the significance of de-\ntection for each spectral component. We have selected a con-\nfidence level threshold of 95% to accept an additional spectral\ncomponent as being real. The criteria that we used to select\nX-ray absorbed sources is to have an F-test significance \u226595%.\nThis is different from some definitions found in the literature,\nbecause we did not impose a lower threshold in the detected\nvalues of NH. For example, Ueda et al. (2003) defined as X-ray\nabsorbed the sources with absorption column density at the\nsource redshift \u22651022 cm\u22122. However, it is important to note\nthat with our criteria all sources selected as X-ray absorbed had\nvalues of NH \u2265 21 cm\u22122.\n7. Single power law fitting (SPL)\nWe have used a single power law model to fit the 0.2\u221212 keV\nemission of all the objects. In this model, the free parameters\nare the normalisation (the same for MOS and pn spectra) and\nthe slope of the broad band continuum, \u03936. The power law is\nabsorbed with a fixed column density of 5.7 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 to in-\nclude the effect of the absorption by our Galaxy in the direction\nof the Lockman Hole field.\n7.1. Dependence of \u0393 with the X-ray flux\nThe results of the fits have been used to study the dependence\nof \u0393 with the X-ray fluxes obtained from the SPL model. The\nresults are plotted in Fig. 4. In plots (a) and (b) we show the\ndependence of \u3008\u0393\u3009 with the 0.5\u22122 keV and 2\u221210 keV fluxes.\nThe bin sizes were defined in order to have the same number of\nobjects per bin, and the average values were obtained weighting\n6 We use the power law photon number index, \u0393. Its relation with\nthe energy index is \u03b1 = \u0393 \u2212 1.\nS. Mateos et al.: X-ray spectra LH 85\nwith the errors of each individual value. When a single power\nlaw model is used, we see that the average continuum shape\nbecomes harder with decreasing 0.5\u22122 keV flux. However, it\nis interesting to note that we do not see any dependence of \u3008\u0393\u3009\nwith the 2\u221210 keV flux down to \u223c3 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121.\nThe values of \u3008\u0393\u3009were calculated with the standard formula\nfor the weighted mean,\n\u3008\u0393\u3009 =\n\u2211\nPi \u00d7 \u0393i\nwhere the weight, Pi, of each individual best fit value, \u0393i, is\na function of the error in the parameter obtained from the fit,\n\u03c3i, i.e.\nPi =\n1 \/\u03c32i\u2211 (1 \/\u03c32i )\n\u00b7\nTo calculate the uncertainty in \u3008\u0393\u3009 we have used the error on\nthe weighted mean (Bevington et al. 1992),\n\u03c32(\u3008\u0393\u3009) = 1(N \u2212 1)\n\u2211\nPi \u00d7 (\u0393i \u2212 \u3008\u0393\u3009)2\nthat includes the measurement errors, \u03c3i, and the dispersion of\neach \u0393i from the estimated value \u3008\u0393\u3009. Using these expressions\nwe found that our objects have \u3008\u0393\u3009 = 1.79 \u00b1 0.03 when their\nspectra are fitted with a SPL (the value is 1.60 \u00b1 0.05 if we use\nthe unweighted mean).\nIn order to understand better the origin of the hardening\nof \u3008\u0393\u3009 with the 0.5\u22122 keV flux, and why we do not see the\nsame effect using 2\u221210 keV fluxes, we have plotted in Figs. 4c\nand d the values of \u0393 that we obtained for each individual ob-\nject. Thanks to the good quality of our data we can see that \u3008\u0393\u3009\nbecomes harder because at faint 0.5\u22122 keV fluxes a population\nof faint sources is revealed with very hard (\u22641) spectral slopes.\nWe also see that the number of faint hard objects becomes more\nimportant as we go to fainter fluxes. In the 2\u221210 keV band we\ndo not see the hardening of \u3008\u0393\u3009 because these hard objects are\ndetected at all 2\u221210 keV fluxes. Moreover, their number seems\nnot to vary with the 2\u221210 keV flux.\nWe have studied whether our criteria for selection of ob-\njects (i.e. MOS+pn background subtracted counts above 500)\ncould be introducing any bias in our results. In particular we\nhave studied whether, for a given flux, we are favouring ob-\njects with a given spectral slope. To study this, we have carried\nout simulations. We first defined a grid of points in \u0393 and S\n(first using 0.5\u22122 keV flux and later with 2\u221210 keV flux), cov-\nering the same range of \u0393 \u2212 S values as our sources. Using\na pair of on-axis response matrices, arf and rmf, and typical\nbackground spectra selected from one of our objects, we have\nsimulated a spectrum on each grid point. With the simulated\nspectra we have calculated the minimum exposure time that is\nneeded to reach the threshold in number of counts that we have\nused to select our sources (i.e. 500 MOS+pn background sub-\ntracted counts). With these simulations we were not interested\nin quantifying the limits of detection as a function of S and \u0393,\nbut to study the biases in our sample, and whether they affect\nour results. Therefore we only need to do one simulation on\neach grid point and then we just have to search for the points in\nthe \u0393 \u2212 S grid with the same value of the exposure time.\nA constant exposure time line to get 500 counts is repre-\nsented with the dot-dash lines in plots (c) and (d) in Fig. 4\nfor an exposure time of 280 ks. We see that in the soft\nband, for a given flux, we have the same efficiency of de-\ntection for different values of \u0393 down to 1.5. At fluxes\nabove \u223c10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 this bias is not affecting the ob-\nserved hardening of \u0393. Only the bin at the faintest 0.5\u22122 keV\nfluxes (plot (a)) could be affected by this bias. Our simulations\nshow that the hardening in \u3008\u0393\u3009 is an intrinsic property of our ob-\njects. As we said in Sect. 3, our objects were all detected in the\nsoft band, therefore this effect is a property of the 0.5\u22122 keV\npopulation of objects. The objects responsible for the harden-\ning of \u3008\u0393\u3009 can be more absorbed sources or sources having in-\ntrinsically harder spectra.\nIn the 2\u221210 keV band we obtained different results from\nthe simulations. At the faintest fluxes we most easily detect\nobjects with soft spectra. This is an expected result because the\neffective area of the X-ray detectors in XMM-Newton decreases\nrapidly at energies \u22655 keV and therefore it is more difficult to\ndetect faint objects with flat spectral slopes. However, down\nto the flux level where we start to lose faint hard objects, \u223c6 \u00d7\n10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121, we see that there is no dependence of \u0393with\nhard flux because hard objects are detected at all flux levels.\n8. Absorbed power law fitting (APL)\nIn order to study the nature of the population of faint hard\nsources responsible for the hardening of \u3008\u0393\u3009with the 0.5\u22122 keV\nflux we have fitted the spectra of all the objects with an ab-\nsorbed power law model. The free parameters of this model\nare the normalisation, the spectral slope of the power law com-\nponent, and the intrinsic (rest-frame) absorption of the objects\nthat we have measured in the observer\u2019s frame (NobsH ). Again,\nwe also included the effect of the Galactic absorption in the\ndirection of the Lockman Hole. Using the APL model we ob-\ntained a value for the weighted mean of \u3008\u0393\u3009 = 1.87 \u00b1 0.04 (the\nvalue being \u3008\u0393\u3009 = 1.95 \u00b1 0.08 using the arithmetic mean) for\nthe objects where absorption was detected (F-test \u2265 95%), and\n\u3008\u0393\u3009 = 1.95 \u00b1 0.03 (the value being \u3008\u0393\u3009 = 1.82 \u00b1 0.04 using\nthe arithmetic mean) for the objects where we did not detect\nabsorption (F-test < 95%).\nThe dependence of \u3008\u0393\u3009 on 0.5\u22122 keV and 2\u221210 keV\nfluxes that we see fitting the spectra of our objects with the\nAPL model is shown in Fig. 5. For the objects where absorp-\ntion was detected we used the spectral parameters (\u0393 and ob-\nserved S) obtained with the APL model. For the unabsorbed\nsources we used the parameters from the SPL model. We see\nthat absorption can account for most of the hardening of \u3008\u0393\u3009\nwith the soft X-ray flux. We also see in Fig. 5 that the same\ndependence of \u3008\u0393\u3009 with the X-ray flux is obtained for absorbed\nand unabsorbed objects.\nMateos et al. (2005) found that for their serendipitous X-ray\nsources (with much lower spectral quality), the average spec-\ntrum of unabsorbed (F-test significance <95%) sources signif-\nicantly hardens at faint 0.5\u22122 keV fluxes. They concluded that\nundetected absorption was responsible for the observed effect\nin unabsorbed sources. The magnitude of undetected absorp-\ntion cannot be very significant in our Lockman Hole sources as\n86 S. Mateos et al.: X-ray spectra LH\nFig. 5. Dependence of \u3008\u0393\u3009 with 0.5\u22122 and 2\u221210 keV flux for absorbed (F-test \u226595%) and unabsorbed (F-test< 95%) sources. For each source\nwe used \u0393 and S from its best fit model (single power law or absorbed power law). See Sect. 8 for details.\nFig. 6. Distribution of NobsH for absorbed (F-test \u2265 95%; squares) and unabsorbed (F-test < 95%; triangles) objects. Error bars correspond to\n90% confidence.\nwe do not see a clear hardening of \u3008\u0393\u3009 for unabsorbed sources.\nUsing \u0393 and S from the APL model for unabsorbed sources\nwe obtain the same result. Hence, if we still have sources with\nundetected absorption, their absorbing column densities cannot\nbe very high. Moreover, we do not find evidence for the exis-\ntence of a population of faint sources with intrinsically harder\nspectral slopes.\nThe results for the hard fluxes do not vary significantly from\nwhat we obtained with the SPL fits. This is exactly what we\nwould expect if absorption produces the hardening of \u0393, be-\ncause the 2\u221210 keV fluxes are less affected by absorption.\nIn Fig. 6 we plot the values of absorption (observer\u2019s frame)\nthat we obtained with the APL model, as a function of the\n0.5\u22122 and 2\u221210 keV fluxes. There is an obvious correlation\nbetween the absorption and the observed soft flux. We see that\nthe distribution of absorbing column densities does not seem to\nvary with the hard band fluxes. We have studied the dependence\nof NobsH with the 0.5\u22122 keV flux using de-absorbed fluxes, i.e.\nthe 0.5\u22122 keV fluxes corrected for the effect of absorption. We\nfound that when de-absorbed fluxes are used, NobsH does not\nvary with X-ray flux, i.e., fainter and\/or more distant objects\ndo not appear to be more absorbed.\nWe have studied whether the fraction of X-ray absorbed\nobjects depends on the flux after correcting for the effect of ab-\nsorption (the NH columns measured in our sample of sources\nare not high enough as to affect significantly the measured\n2\u221210 keV fluxes and hence the correction of 2\u221210 keV fluxes\nfor the effect of absorption is not significant). The results are\nplotted in Fig. 7. For comparison we have plotted the re-\nsults that we obtain when absorbed fluxes are used (circles).\nWe do not see significant differences using absorbed or de-\nabsorbed 2\u221210 keV fluxes, because as explained before, these\nare not significantly affected by the absorption measured in\nour sources. However important differences are seen when\n0.5\u22122 keV fluxes are used. If we do not correct for the effect\nof absorption in the 0.5\u22122 keV flux, we see an increase in the\nfraction of absorbed objects at fainter fluxes. However, if de-\nabsorbed fluxes are used instead, the fraction of absorbed ob-\njects does not vary with the X-ray flux and we obtain the same\nresult as in the 2\u221210 keV band.\nNote that the fraction of absorbed sources at the faintest\nde-absorbed 0.5\u22122 keV fluxes (\u223c20%) is significantly lower\nthan the values found at brighter fluxes. The absorbed sources\nthat should contribute to the bin at the faintest fluxes have an\nS. Mateos et al.: X-ray spectra LH 87\nFig. 7.

Another effect that could also\ncontribute to this result is that at the faintest fluxes we may\nhave some sources with undetected absorption. We do not ex-\npect this effect to be important, because as we see in Fig. 5 \u3008\u0393\u3009\nfor unabsorbed sources does not seem to become significantly\nharder at the faintest 0.5\u22122 keV fluxes.\n9. Best fit model\nUp to now we have shown the results from spectral fits\nwhere only the X-ray continuum and the intrinsic absorption\nwere modelled. However, there are other spectral components\nthat can also contribute significantly to the emission in the\n0.2\u221212 keV energy band. There is evidence for them in the\nresults that we have shown previously. For example we see in\nFig. 5 that \u3008\u0393\u3009 seems not to vary with the X-ray flux when ab-\nsorption is included in the fitting model. However we still have\na clear scatter in the points which cannot be explained if \u0393 does\nnot vary significantly with flux for the objects in our sample\nas our results appear to show. However, we would expect this\nscatter of \u3008\u0393\u3009 if other spectral components are present in the\ndata (e.g. soft excess emission) and they are not properly mod-\nelled. Besides the soft excess, other spectral components that\ncan contribute to the 0.2\u221212 keV emission are ionised absorp-\ntion, the Fe K\u03b1 emission complex and the Compton reflection\nhump that should appear at high X-ray energies.\nWe have studied in detail the MOS and pn time averaged\nspectra of each individual object. To model the soft excess\nemission we have used a black-body model. This component\nadds two free parameters to the fit, the temperature (in keV) and\nnormalisation of the black-body. For some objects we could not\nget a good fit of the detected soft excess with a black-body. In\nall these cases we obtained a good fit using a partial covering\nmodel (i.e., only part of the X-ray emission from the inner most\nregion of the AGN is absorbed) to fit the signatures of absorp-\ntion and soft excess emission. This model introduces one new\nparameter to the fit with respect to the APL model, the covering\nfraction of the absorber (between 0 and 1). The only emission\nline that we expect to detect with the quality of our spectra is\nthe Fe K\u03b1 complex at 6.4 keV (rest frame energy for neutral\niron). To search for this component we have used a Gaussian\nline profile, that allows us to calculate the centroid (in most\ncases we fixed the centroid to 6.4 keV), width and normali-\nsation of the line. Absorption signatures found in some spectra\nwere modelled with an absorption edge (zedge in xspec). This\nmodel introduced two free spectral parameters, the threshold\nenergy and the absorption depth at the threshold energy. The\nmost prominent signature from reflection in AGN is a change\nin the slope of the X-ray continuum at energies above 10 keV\n(rest frame). This component is known as the Compton reflec-\ntion hump. We do not expect our objects to be bright enough as\nto detect with high significance reflection signatures given the\nlimited bandpass of XMM-Newton. However, we have searched\nfor this component in all the spectra adding a second power law\nto the fits at high energies.\nThe best fit model for each source is the one that gave a\nsignificant improvement in fit over the previous one in the se-\nquence SPL-APL (with z in the case of identified sources)-\nAPL+soft excess. The improvement in the fit was measured\nby the usual F-test, taking into account the improvement in the\n\u03c72 value and the number of new parameters introduced. For\nsome objects with soft excess emission, the detection of ab-\nsorption was only significant after modelling of this spectral\ncomponent. In particular, when the classification (type-1\/type-2\nAGN) of the identified sources is used, the parameters from the\nAPL model with intrinsic absorption are always used.\nOur results are listed in Table 2. The best fit spectral pa-\nrameters obtained for each object are shown in Table 8. In the\npresent paper we identify our objects with the numbers that\nwill be used in a forthcoming catalogue paper of the Lockman\nHole (H. Brunner et al. 2005, in preparation). The results were\nobtained fitting MOS and pn spectra simultaneously. If it was\nnot required by the data we used the same MOS and pn model\nnormalisations.

Among these objects there were 35 type-1 AGN\nand 5 type-2 AGN. We detected absorption in 53 objects out\nof 123 (43%), including 7 type-1 AGN and 23 type-2 AGN. In\nTable 3 we list the fraction of absorbed objects in our sample\nand in the samples of type-1 and type-2 AGN. The values were\ncorrected for spurious detections7 following the method de-\nscribed in Mateos et al. (2005). We used the method described\nin Stevens et al. (2005) and Mateos et al. (2005) to compare\nthe fraction of absorbed objects in type-1 and type-2 AGN. We\nfind that these fractions are different (the number of absorbed\nobjects in type-2 AGN being larger than in type-1 AGN) with\na significance of more than 99.99%.\n9.1. Broad band continuum\nUsing the best fit spectral slopes we obtained a weighted \u3008\u0393\u3009 for\nthe objects in our sample of 1.87\u00b10.02 (1.86\u00b10.02 if the arith-\nmetic mean is used). In Fig. 8 we show the dependence of \u3008\u0393\u3009\nwith the 0.5\u22122 keV flux using the best fit parameters (\u0393 and S)\nfor each object (the same result is obtained using 2\u221210 keV\nfluxes). We see that when we take into account during fitting\nall the spectral components, the scatter in \u3008\u0393\u3009 (see Fig. 5) is re-\nduced significantly, and most of the points are consistent with\nthe obtained average value of \u0393.\n7 We accepted the spectral signatures as being real if the signifi-\ncance of detection from the F-test was \u226595%. Hence 5% of detections\nare expected to be spurious.\nFig. 8. Dependence \u3008\u0393\u3009 with 0.5\u22122 keV flux. For each source we used\nthe spectral parameters obtained from its best fit model (see Sect. 9 for\ndetails).\nThe mean spectral slope was found to be 1.89 \u00b1 0.03\n(1.88 \u00b1 0.03 with the arithmetic mean) for type-1 AGN and\n1.71 \u00b1 0.03 (1.82 \u00b1 0.06 with the arithmetic mean) for type-2\nAGN. In Fig. 9 we compare \u3008\u0393\u3009 for type-1 and type-2 AGN\nas a function of the X-ray fluxes. For type-1 AGN, where\nonly 7 out of 46 are X-ray absorbed, we obtain the same re-\nsults using 0.5\u22122 and 2\u221210 keV fluxes, i.e., no dependence of\n\u3008\u0393\u3009 with the X-ray flux. However, X-ray absorption is impor-\ntant in type-2 AGN (\u226550% of type-2 AGN being X-ray ab-\nsorbed). The ratio of type-2 AGN\/type-1 AGN increases as we\ngo to fainter 0.5\u22122 keV absorbed (i.e. not absorption corrected)\nfluxes, while it remains constant with 2\u221210 keV flux. We ex-\nplained in detail in Sect. 6 that this is due to the existing correla-\ntion between NH and the soft absorbed flux, i.e. most absorbed\nobjects have the faintest fluxes in the 0.5\u22122 keV band. We see\nin Fig. 9 that there is a clear dispersion in \u3008\u0393\u3009 for type-1 and\ntype-2 AGN, however it seems that type-2 AGN tend to have\nlower \u3008\u0393\u3009 than type-1 AGN at the fluxes covered by our sample.\nExcluding from the sample of type-2 AGN the three sources\nthat we found with no detected X-ray absorption and spectral\nslope significantly lower than the average value for type-1 AGN\n(see Sect. 11 and Table 7), we still see the same dependence\nof \u3008\u0393\u3009 with X-ray flux for type-2 AGN.\nWe have followed the procedure described in Nandra &\nPounds (1994) and Maccacaro et al. (1988) to estimate the\nintrinsic dispersion of the photon index in type-1 and type-2\nAGN, and to investigate whether after allowing for intrinsic\ndispersion in \u0393, we still find type-2 AGN to be on average flatter\nthan type-1 AGN. In this method it is assumed that the disper-\nsion in \u0393 values can be described well with a Gaussian function\nof mean \u3008\u0393\u3009 and dispersion\u03c3\u3008\u0393\u3009. The results of this analysis are\nlisted in Table 4, where we have the values obtained using the\nweighted mean for comparison. We have found that there is\nan intrinsic dispersion in \u0393 of \u223c0.2 in type-1 AGN and type-2\nAGN, and that the value of the dispersion is similar in both\nsamples of objects. It is interesting to note that the results ob-\ntained with the weighted mean and the Maximum Likelihood\nmethod are consistent within each other.\nS. Mateos et al.: X-ray spectra LH 89\nFig. 9.

The significance of type-2 AGN being on average\nflatter than type-1 AGN is only at 1.62\u03c3 (using the values of \u0393\nobtained with the ML method8).\nHowever, it is important to note that if the signatures of\nabsorption in the X-ray spectra are not very significant, the de-\ntected values of NH will tend to be lower than the real ones\n(see Mateos et al. 2005) and then, the fitted \u0393 will be flatter.\nWe expect this effect to be more important for type-2 AGN\nwhere we have more sources with absorption. The small differ-\nence in \u3008\u0393\u3009 for type-1 and type-2 AGN might be due to this ef-\nfect. Therefore with the current data we cannot reach any strong\nconclusion.\n9.2. X-ray absorption\nWe have detected X-ray absorption in \u223c37% of the sources in\nour sample. Absorption was found in \u223c10% of type-1 AGN\nand\u223c77% of type-2 AGN. We first checked that the measured \u0393\nand NH were not correlated, and therefore that we have ob-\ntained reliable parameters, especially the column density for\n8 Note that the significance of \u0393 being different for type-1 AGN and\ntype-2 AGN is \u223c4\u03c3 if the values obtained with the weighted mean are\nused and no intrinsic dispersion in \u0393 is considered.\nFig. 10.

The results are plotted in Fig. 11 for\nsources with known redshifts, where we do not see any evident\ncorrelation between the two spectral parameters. In the objects\nwith large \u0393, the values including the error bars are in all cases\nconsistent with a value of \u0393 \u223c 2.\nNote in Fig. 11, that the NintrH distributions in type-1 and\ntype-2 AGN seem to be different. The measured column den-\nsities in absorbed type-1 AGN are between 1021\u22121022 cm\u22122,\nwhile type-2 AGN have a much wider distribution of values,\nmany objects having NintrH \u2265 1023 cm\u22122. We show the distribu-\ntions of NintrH in type-1 and type-2 AGN in Fig. 12. The distribu-\ntions appear to be different, with type-2 AGN being in general\nmore absorbed than type-1 AGN. Using the KS test to compare\nthe two distributions we obtained a probability of them being\ndifferent of >92%. We will have to wait for the analysis of the\nfaint sample of objects before reaching a stronger conclusion.\nIn terms of the unified model of AGN, X-ray absorption and\noptical obscuration should be correlated. There is observational\nevidence that this does not hold for all AGN, although only\n90 S.

Distributions of intrinsic (rest frame) absorption in type-1 and\ntype-2 AGN obtained from the best fit model for sources.\na few cases are based on a proper spectral analysis. We can\nconfirm that these discrepancies exist in a significant fraction\nof our objects. Mateos et al. (2005) found some indications that\nthe AGN\/host galaxy contrast effect9 might explain why broad\noptical lines are not observed in unabsorbed type-2 AGN. In\nFig. 13 we show the redshift distribution of the AGN in our\nsample. Because our sample of AGN is much smaller we can\nnot perform a similar test.\n9.3. Soft excess\nWe detected soft excess emission (\u226595% confidence limit from\nan F-test) in 18 (15%) objects. The number of MOS+pn counts\nin the soft excess component vary from 100 to 1000 except for\none source where the soft excess component has \u223c3000 counts.\nWithin the sources classified as AGN we found soft excess\n9 In the redshift interval where the distributions of type-1 and type-2\nAGN overlapped, they found that unabsorbed type-2 AGN were less\nluminous than type-1 AGN.\nFig. 13. 2\u221210 keV luminosity (corrected for absorption) vs. redshift\nfor type-1 and type-2 AGN. Absorbed sources are the objects where\nwe found an F-test significance of improvement of the fits \u226595%.\nin 5 (11%) type-1 AGN and 7 (25%) type-2 AGN. The signifi-\ncance of the fractions of type-1 and type-2 AGN with detected\nsoft excess emission being different is 97%.\nAlthough our results suggest that soft excess emission\nmight be more common in type-2 AGN, it is important to\nnote that our samples of type-1 and type-2 AGN have different\nredshift distributions, and for the highest redshift sources (all\ntype-1 AGN) we expect most of the signatures of soft excess\nemission to be redshifted outside the observed energy interval,\nmaking the detection of soft excess more difficult. Therefore,\nwe have repeated the comparison using only sources in the red-\nshift interval where we detected soft excess (z < 1.568). In this\ncase, the significance of the fractions of type-1 and type-2 AGN\nwith detected soft excess emission being different is reduced\nto 87%. Hence, with our data we cannot confirm that soft ex-\ncess emission is more common in type-2 AGN than in type-1\nAGN.\nIn 9 sources (4 type-1 AGN, 4 type-2 AGN and 1 unidenti-\nfied object) we fitted the soft excess emission with a black body\nmodel (a Raymond Smith model gave an equally good fit). The\nproperties of the soft excess, i.e. temperature, 0.5\u22122 keV lu-\nminosity and strength, for the identified sources are listed in\nTable 5. We see that the measured black-body properties do\nnot depend on the 2\u221210 keV X-ray luminosity of the objects.\nFor the unidentified object with detected soft excess fitted with\na black body we found an observed black body temperature\nof 0.164\u22120.046\n+0.033 eV.\nThe average temperature of the black body was found to\nbe 0.09 \u00b1 0.01 keV for type-1 AGN and 0.26 \u00b1 0.08 keV for\ntype-2 AGN. The average 0.5\u22122 keV luminosities of the black\nbody (in log units) were 43.42 \u00b1 0.43 erg s\u22121 for type-1 AGN\nand 44.11 \u00b1 0.44 erg s\u22121 for type-2 AGN. The 0.5\u22122 keV lu-\nminosities of the soft excess component in type-1 and type-2\nAGN were not found to be significantly different (a KS test of\nthe luminosity distributions gave a significance of them being\ndifferent of only 90%). However the measured temperatures of\nthe soft excess were found to be higher in type-2 AGN than in\ntype-1 AGN. This could be because the soft excess in type-2\nAGN might contain a fraction of scattered radiation. We also\nS. Mateos et al.: X-ray spectra LH 91\nTable 5.

Componization of cool pho-\ntons in a cloud of hot electrons surrounding the accretion disc\nmight be an alternative explanation.\nIn 9 other objects (1 type-1 AGN, 3 type-2 AGN\nand 5 unidentified objects) the black body could not fit the sig-\nnatures of the soft excess. An alternative method for modelling\nthe curvature at soft energies is a scattering or partial cover-\ning model (pcfabs in xspec). The model consists of the sum\nof two power law components having the same spectral index,\nbut affected by different absorption (quantified with the cov-\nering fraction parameter). This model improved significantly\nthe quality of the fits, and provided a good fit of the soft ex-\ncess emission in all sources. The average covering fraction that\nwe obtained was 0.82\u00b1 0.06 (the maximum and minimum val-\nues being 0.98 and 0.50). This value implies that the scattering\nfraction in these sources is rather large (18 \u00b1 6%).\n9.4. Reprocessed components\nWe have searched for a flattening of the continuum at high\nenergies (i.e. Compton reflection) adding a second power law\nto the model. We have found signatures of spectral hardening\nat high energies in only one object, source 108, which is still\nunidentified. The unfolded MOS and pn spectra of this source\nare shown in Fig. 14. We first fitted the X-ray spectrum of this\nobject with a single power law giving \u0393 \u223c 1.5 but the fit was\npoor, with a \u03c72 of 127 for 67 degrees of freedom. We found that\nthere was a clear excess emission at high energies. We then\nfitted the spectrum with two power laws, and the \u03c72 signifi-\ncantly decreased to 98 for 65 degrees of freedom. The F-test\nsignificance of improvement of the fit with the new component\nwas 99.98%.

We did not find evidence for X-ray absorption\nor emission lines in the spectrum of this source. We will have\nto wait until we have the optical identification of this source\nbefore saying more about the X-ray emission of this object.\nAnother signature of reprocessing that has been found in\nmany spectra of AGN is an emission line around 6.4 keV.\nThis is interpreted as Fe K\u03b1 fluorescence from cold matter\n(Pounds et al. 1989, 1990; Nandra et al. 1991; Nandra &\nPounds 1994) and might originate from the reprocessing of\nhard X-ray photons in the accretion disc (Pounds et al. 1990).\nWe have searched for this component in our sources using a\nGaussian model.

In Fig. 15 we show the MOS+pn\nunfolded time averaged spectra of these sources. The parame-\nters of the Gaussian line for each identified source are listed in\nTable 6.\nSources 21 and 407: in these sources we found a signifi-\ncant width in the line profile, which might be indicating that\nthe line was formed in the inner parts of the accretion disc,\nand hence it should have a relativistic profile (with a red wing\ncomponent due to gravitational redshift). When fitted with a\nGaussian model, we would expect the line centroid to be found\nat an energy slightly below 6.4 keV. While in source 407 the\nline centroid is consistent with being neutral iron, in source 21\nS. Mateos et al.: X-ray spectra LH 93\nTable 6.

In source 172 the line centroid was\nconsistent with being neutral iron, but in source 326 it was sig-\nnificantly higher (even within the error bars). In this source the\nline might be originating in an ionised accretion disc.\nIn all the spectra where we detected the line we did not\nhave enough signal to noise in the data in order to use a more\nphysical model to fit the profile of the line (xspecmodels laor\nfor a Kerr black hole or diskline for a Schwarzchild black\nhole). The rest frame equivalent width (EW) of the line in the\ntype-1 AGN where we detected this component was found to\nbe \u223c452 eV. In most type-2 AGN the measured values were\nbetween 200 and 600 eV. However there is one source, 21 for\nwhich we found a rest frame EW of \u223c1400, substantially higher\nthan in the other type-2 AGN. It is important to note that in this\nsource the F-test significance of detection of line was the lowest\namong all sources (95%) and hence the measured value has the\nhighest uncertainty.\nUsing the same sample of objects, Streblyanska\net al. (2005) found a clear relativistic line profile in the\naverage rest-frame spectrum of type-1 and type-2 AGN. In\nobjects with broad Fe lines, the contribution of the broad\ncomponent is difficult to detect if there is not enough signal\nto noise since its contribution is less than 10% above the\ncontinuum over most of the spectrum.\n10. Dependence of sources spectra\nwith luminosity and redshift\nWe show \u0393 and NintrH vs. redshift for type-1 AGN and type-2\nAGN in Fig. 17. In these plots we can see the different redshift\ndistributions between the type-1 and type-2 AGN in our sam-\nple. Most detected type-2 AGN have redshifts below 1, while\nwe find type-1 AGN up to a redshift of \u223c3.5. We have applied a\nSpearman correlation test to search for evolution of \u0393 and NintrH\nwith redshift. We found that the correlation between \u0393 and red-\nshift is \u22120.22 for type-1 AGN and \u22120.04 for type-2 AGN. The\nsignificance of \u0393 being flatter at higher redshifts is 86% for\ntype-1 AGN and 15% for type-2 AGN. The continuum shape of\nour sample of AGN does not seem to evolve with redshift, how-\never the number of AGN at high redshift (specially the number\nof type-2 AGN) is too small to give a strong conclusion.\nThe same result is obtained when searching for correlation\nof NintrH with redshift, i.e. AGN at high redshift do not seem\nto be more absorbed than local ones. The apparent scarcity of\nhigh redshift (z \u2265 1) low NH sources is probably a selection\neffect, since it is easier to detect highly absorbed sources at\nhigh redshifts.\nWe have studied the dependence of \u0393 and NintrH with the\n2\u221210 keV X-ray luminosity (we use the 2\u221210 keV luminos-\nity because these values are less affected by X-ray absorption).\nThe results are plotted in Fig. 18. We do not see any corre-\nlation between the spectral slope and the column density of\nour AGN with 2\u221210 keV X-ray luminosity. Note in Fig. 18\nthat our sample contains 6 objects (all optically identified as\ntype-2 AGN) that fall within the \u201cstandard\u201d QSO2 region, i.e.,\nLX \u2265 1044 erg s\u22121 and NintrH \u2265 1022 cm\u22122.\n11. Unabsorbed type-2 AGN\nWe have found 5 objects identified as type-2 AGN but with\nno clear evidence of X-ray absorption in their X-ray spectrum\n(\u223c23%, see Table. 3). In Fig. 19 we show the unfolded spectra\nof these sources obtained with their best fit model (in all the\ncases a single power law). Several authors have found AGN\nwith weak or no broad emission lines in their optical spectrum\nand with unabsorbed X-ray spectra (see for example Pappa\net al. 2001; Panessa et al. 2002; Barcons et al. 2003; Mateos\net al. 2005; Carrera et al. 2004; Corral et al. 2005).\nOne possible explanation for these results is that the sig-\nnal to noise of the spectra of these sources is not high enough\nto detect signatures of X-ray absorption (see e.g. Mateos et al.\n2005). Our current data is however of sufficient quality to de-\ntect X-ray absorption or X-ray absorption+soft excess to weak\n94 S. Mateos et al.: X-ray spectra LH\nFig. 16.

Evolution with redshift of \u0393 and NintrH (rest-frame) for type-1 and type-2 AGN. Error bars correspond to 90% confidence.\nlevels. Moreover, as we see in Fig. 19 the time averaged spectra\nof these sources has enough signal to noise as to detect X-ray\nabsorption with the column densities common in type-2 AGN.\nWe have calculated the upper limits (at 90% confidence) to the\nX-ray absorption in these sources. They are listed in Table 7.\nThe values that we obtain are lower than the typical column\ndensities found in our absorbed type-2 AGN. If these sources\nare X-ray absorbed, the values for the column density that we\nhave found are consistent with arising in absorption from their\nhost galaxy.\nAnother possibility that might explain the lack of X-ray ab-\nsorption in these sources is X-ray spectral variability. The op-\ntical and X-ray observations of these sources have not been\nobtained simultaneously, and the X-ray absorption in these\nsources might have changed with time. Corral et al. (2005)\nstudied the hypothesis of spectral variability using simulta-\nneous X-ray and optical observations of the Seyfert galaxy\nMkn993. They found the source to be X-ray unabsorbed but\nin a type 1.9 optical. Results of a detailed study of X-ray flux\nand spectral variability on scales from months to years of the\nsame sample of sources used for this work, will be presented in\na forthcoming paper (Mateos et al. 2005b in preparation) where\nwe show that X-ray variability cannot explain the lack of X-ray\nabsorption in our unabsorbed type-2 AGN.\nWe have checked whether these sources can be Compton-\nthick type-2 AGN. If the torus is Compton-thick to optical scat-\ntering, even 2\u221210 keV photons will not be directly seen and\nhence the direct radiation in these sources would be completely\nblocked. In some cases scattered radiation (with no apparent\nabsorption) could be the only radiation seen below 10 keV.\nIn Compton-thick sources, because the primary radiation is\nfainter, the equivalent width of the K\u03b1 line increases. Bassani\net al. (1999) show a diagram of the EW versus the transmission\nparameter T, where T is SX\/S[OIII]11. This diagram can be used\nto identify Compton-thick sources if the values of EW and T\nare known. We do not know the value of S[OIII] for our sources,\nhowever we have measured the EW to check in which part of\nthe diagram our sources fall. To measure the EW we added a\n11 S X is the X-ray flux and S [OIII] is the optical flux of the\n[OIII] \u03bb5007 emission line. [OIII] \u03bb5007 has been frequently used\nas an isotropic indicator of the intrinsic brightness of the sources.\nS. Mateos et al.: X-ray spectra LH 95\nFig. 18.

We fixed the centroid of the line to 6.4 and\nthe width to 0 (the quality of the fits did not improve allow-\ning the line parameters to vary). Only in source 21, there might\nbe emission from iron K\u03b1 line (F-test significance \u223c95%). In\nthe other sources there are no indications of iron K\u03b1 emission.\nThe values of the EW that we have found are listed in Col. 6\nof Table 7. In most of the cases we obtained a value of the EW\nbelow \u223c1500, and therefore these sources fall outside the re-\ngion of Compton-thick sources in the Bassani et al. (1999) dia-\ngram. However, to confirm our results, specially for objects 21\nand 476 with EW values above 1000 eV, we need a reliable\nmeasurement of the [OIII] flux.\n12. Extragalactic X-ray background\nThe spectrum of the extragalactic X-ray background (XRB)\nwas measured by the HEAO satellite (Marshall et al. 1980)\nfrom 1\u221250 keV. At these energies, the XRB spectrum can\nbe reproduced well by an optically thin plasma of tempera-\nture \u223c40 keV. At low energies, \u226415 keV, a good description of\nthe data is obtained with a power law of \u0393 = 1.4. The spectrum\nof the XRB is significantly flatter than the typical spectrum\nof AGN. A population of heavily absorbed AGN, predicted\nby synthesis models of the XRB (e.g. Setti & Woltjer 1989;\nComastri et al. 1995; Gilli et al. 2001; Gandhi & Fabian 2003;\nUeda et al. 2003), might account for this discrepancy.\nWe have carried out a stacking of MOS\/pn time averaged\nspectra of the sources that we have analysed. Details on the\nanalysis are given in Appendix A. The goal of this analysis\nwas to compare the integrated emission of our sources, with\nan average spectral shape of \u223c1.92 (see Sect. 9.1), with the\nspectrum of the XRB in the 2\u22127 keV energy band.\nWe fitted MOS and pn stacked spectra with xspec using\na simple power law model. Then we divided the measured\nXRB intensities (in units of keV2 keV\u22121 cm\u22122 s\u22121 at 1 keV)\nby the total solid angle covered by XMM-Newton (0.4 deg2 or\n1.2185\u00d7 10\u22124 sr) to obtain the resolved fraction of XRB in the\narea surveyed.\nFigure 20 shows the total extragalactic XRB spectrum as\nmeasured by the HEAO-1 mission (solid line) but renormalised\nto the 2\u22128 keV intensity observed by De Luca & Molendi\n(2004). The points show the 2\u221210 keV XRB spectrum seen\nby MOS (diamonds) and pn (stars).\nWe found that the 2\u22127 keV XRB resolved by our\nsources was best fitted with a power law of \u0393 =\n1.59 \u00b1 0.03 and N = 4.78 \u00b1 0.15 keV2 keV\u22121 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121\n(at 1 keV) for MOS data and \u0393 = 1.54 \u00b1 0.04 and N =\n4.38 \u00b1 0.14 keV2 keV\u22121 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 (at 1 keV) for pn data.\nThe integrated contribution of our sources is indeed harder\nthan the spectrum of the brightest AGN, but still softer than\nthe XRB at these energies. Since our sources have been se-\nlected in the 0.2\u221212 keV band, we probably missed faint\nabsorbed sources. Worsley et al. (2004) did include fainter\nsources than the present study, and hence they reached a\nsignificantly higher integrated emission at 1 keV (N =\n11 \u00b1 0.5 keV2 keV\u22121 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121). A further component not\ndetectable by XMM-Newton arising above 5 keV might also\nbe present, as argued by Worsley et al. (2004).\n13. Discussion and conclusions\nWe have carried out a detailed study of the X-ray spectra of a\nsample of 123 objects detected with XMM-Newton in a deep\nobservation in the Lockman Hole field. The EPIC spectra of\nthese sources have all more than 500 background subtracted\ncounts (MOS+pn) in the energy interval form 0.2\u221212 keV.\nThanks to the good signal to noise of the data we could study\nin detail the different spectral components that contribute to the\nX-ray emission of AGN in the above energy interval.\n13.1. X-ray continuum shape and intrinsic absorption\nThe 0.2\u221212 keV spectra of many AGN cannot be well re-\nproduced with a single power law model. We found that this\nmodel is the best fit model for only \u223c53% of the sample. The\naverage continuum shape of our sources appears to harden\nat fainter 0.5\u22122 keV fluxes (see e.g. Giacconi et al. 2001;\n96 S. Mateos et al.: X-ray spectra LH\nFig. 19. Unfolded MOS and pn spectra of the type-2 AGN without sig-\nnatures of X-ray absorption. Table 7 lists the best fit spectral parameters\nobtained for these sources.\nMainieri et al. 2002; Mateos et al. 2005), but there are some in-\ndications that the same effect is seen for objects detected in the\n2\u221210 keV band (Tozzi et al. 2001a; Streblyanska et al. 2004).\nTwo hypothesis have been suggested to explain it: X-ray ab-\nsorption is more important at fainter fluxes or there exists a\npopulation of faint sources with intrinsically flatter continuum.\nWe confirm that this apparent effect is due to absorption.\nBoth because it is not seen in the 2\u221210 keV band, and because\nit disappears when absorption is taken into account. We do\nnot see any evidence for a population of intrinsically harder\nsources at faint fluxes. However, if sources with larger col-\numn densities were found, then we should see the hardening\nof \u3008\u0393\u3009 in the 2\u221210 keV band. Using a single power law model,\nX-ray absorbed sources had the faintest 0.5\u22122 keV fluxes, but\nthey had the same distribution of 2\u221210 keV fluxes than unab-\nsorbed sources. Because of this, the average \u0393 obtained using a\nS. Mateos et al.: X-ray spectra LH 97\nTable 7.

Spectrum of the extragalactic X-ray background as measured\nby the HEAO satellite but renormalised to the 2\u22128 keV intensity ob-\nserved by De Luca & Mondeli (2004) (solid line). The points show\nthe 2\u22127 keV stacked spectra of the sources that we have analysed\n(M1+M2 (diamonds) and pn (stars)).\nsingle power law model as a function of the 2\u221210 keV flux was\nmeasured to be harder (\u0393 \u223c 1.7) than the typical value of \u223c1.9\nfound in unabsorbed AGN.\nIn the hard band we found no dependence of X-ray ab-\nsorption or fraction of absorbed sources with flux. If observed\n(not corrected for absorption) 0.5\u22122 keV fluxes are used, then\nthe column density and the fraction of absorbed sources in-\ncrease significantly at fainter fluxes. However, using unab-\nsorbed 0.5\u22122 keV fluxes (i.e. fluxes corrected for the effect of\nabsorption) the correlations are not observed and we obtain the\nsame results than in the 2\u221210 keV band. Therefore to study the\ndependence of \u0393 with the X-ray flux it is important to first cor-\nrect the fluxes for the effect of X-ray absorption. Another inter-\nesting result from our analysis is that allowing the objects to be\nX-ray absorbed we found a value of \u3008\u0393\u3009 \u223c 1.9 at all 0.5\u22122 keV\nand 2\u221210 keV fluxes but with significant scatter in the points.\nWe have carried out a detailed study of the X-ray spectra of\neach individual object. We have searched for soft excess emis-\nsion and for signatures of reflection at high energies (Compton\nreflection). We also studied the presence of Fe K\u03b1 emission.\nUsing for each source the value of \u0393 obtained after including all\nthese components to the fitting model we found that the scat-\nter in \u3008\u0393\u3009 is much smaller, and therefore is mostly due to the\npresence of other spectral components in the X-ray emission.\nHowever we still expect some intrinsic scatter in \u0393. To cal-\nculate the intrinsic dispersion in the continuum shape of our\nobjects, we assumed that the distribution of \u0393 could be well\nrepresented with a Gaussian. Under this hypothesis, we found\nour sources to have an average spectral slope of \u223c1.92 with an\nintrinsic dispersion of \u223c0.28.\n13.2. Soft excess emission\nSoft excess was detected in the time averaged spectra of\n18 sources. However only in 9 objects (4 type-1 AGN, 4 type-2\nAGN and 1 unidentified source) we could fit the spectral sig-\nnatures with a black body model (a Raymond Smith gave\nan equally good fit). We found the average temperature of\nthe black body to be 0.09 \u00b1 0.01 keV for type-1 AGN and\n0.26 \u00b1 0.08 keV for type-2 AGN. The average 0.5\u22122 keV lu-\nminosities of the black body were found to be (in log units)\n43.42 \u00b1 0.43 erg s\u22121 in type-1 AGN and 44.11 \u00b1 0.44 erg s\u22121\nin type-2 AGN. The 0.5\u22122 keV luminosities of the soft ex-\ncess component do not differ significantly between type-1 and\ntype-2 AGN, but our results seem to indicate that the black\nbody temperatures are slightly higher in type-2 AGN than in\ntype-1 AGN. This might be due to a higher contribution from\nscattering in type-2 AGN. However due to the small num-\nber of AGN with soft excess analysed we can not reach any\nconclusion. The temperatures of the black body are in most\ncases \u226560 eV, and therefore the origin of the soft excess com-\nponent in these sources cannot be explained as thermal emis-\nsion from the accretion disc only. Componization of cool disc\nphotons by hot electrons surrounding the accretion disc might\nbe an alternative explanation.\nIn 9 sources (including 1 type-1 AGN, 3 type-2 AGN and\n5 sources unidentified) the black body model could not fit\nthe spectral signatures of the soft excess emission. For these\nsources we obtained a good fit with a scattering or partial cov-\nering model (two power laws with the same spectral index but\ndifferent absorptions). The average covering fraction of the ab-\nsorber was found to be 0.82 \u00b1 0.06, which means that the scat-\ntering fraction in these sources is rather large (18 \u00b1 6%).\n13.3. Reprocessed components\nWe found one object in our sample with a flattening in the spec-\ntral slope at high energies. The source is still unidentified so we\nused a model with two power laws to fit its X-ray emission.\nSignatures of an emission line at high energies were\nfound (F-test significance \u226595%) in 8 sources (1 type-1\nAGN, 5 type-2 AGN and 2 unidentified sources). Although\nin some sources the profiles of the lines did not appear to be\n98 S. Mateos et al.: X-ray spectra LH\nsymmetrical, the signal to noise of the spectra was not high\nenough to use more physical models. Therefore we fitted the\nlines in all the sources with a Gaussian model. For most AGN\nwe found the centroids of the lines to be consistent (within the\nerror bars) with being Fe K\u03b1 at an energy of \u223c6.4 keV (rest\nframe). Only in one object we found the line centroid to be\nslightly higher than the expected value for neutral iron. In this\nsource the line might arise as reflection in an ionised accretion\ndisc.\nIn two objects we found significant widths for the emission\nlines. In another two sources the centroids of the lines were\nfound at energies lower than 6.4 keV. In all these sources the\nemission lines might have relativistic line profiles, and there-\nfore they might have been emitted in the inner regions of the\nblack hole accretion disc.\n13.4. X-ray spectra of AGN\nWe found the best fit average spectral slope to be 1.89 \u00b1 0.03\nin type-1 AGN and 1.71 \u00b1 0.03 in type-2 AGN. These values\nseem to indicate that type-2 AGN have harder spectral slopes\nthan type-1 AGN. However assuming that the values of \u0393 that\nwe have obtained for each individual object follow a Gaussian\ndistribution, and allowing the spectral slope to have intrinsic\ndispersion, the significance of type-2 AGN being harder than\ntype-1 AGN is of 1.62\u03c3. This small difference in \u3008\u0393\u3009 for type-1\nand type-2 AGN might be due to the fact that if the signatures\nof absorption are not very significant, the detected values of NH\nwill tend to be lower than the real ones and then, the fitted \u0393\nwill be flatter. This effect will be more important for type-2\nAGN where we expect more sources to be absorbed.\nX-ray absorbed objects were found among type-1 AGN\n(\u223c10%) and type-2 AGN (\u223c77%). We found the fraction of ab-\nsorbed objects in type-1 and type-2 AGN to be different with a\nsignificance of >99.99%. The distribution of absorbing column\ndensities also suggest that type-1 AGN are less absorbed than\ntype-2 AGN. A comparison with a KS test gave a significance\nof these distributions being different at 92% confidence.\nWe did not see a dependence of the AGN continuum shape\nwith the X-ray luminosity or redshift. We found the same re-\nsults for the column density.\n13.5. Unabsorbed type-2 AGN\nWe studied in more detail the X-ray emission of the 5 type-2\nAGN with unabsorbed MOS and pn X-ray spectra. All these\nsources have spectra with enough signal to noise, hence we\nshould have been able to detect signatures of X-ray absorption\nif they are present. We have calculated the upper limit (90%) in\nthe column density. We found that in all cases the values for the\ncolumn density are significantly lower than the typical values\nfound in the absorbed type-2 AGN. If there is X-ray absorption\nin these sources, the low values of the column densities that we\nfind could be explained as arising from the host galaxy. We ar-\ngue that spectral variability is unlikely to be at the heart of the\napparent X-ray\/optical mismatch.\nFinally we do not find compelling evidence that these\nsources are Compton-thick, although the [OIII] flux needs to\nbe measured to reach a firm conclusion.\nAcknowledgements.

In addition, as it was explained in Sect. 6, MOS and pn\ntime averaged spectra were not necessary built using the same\nset of observations, hence the normalisations of the XRB spec-\ntrum obtained with MOS and pn might be slightly different.\nAt the time of this study there were calibration uncertainties\nbetween MOS and pn data at energies below \u223c1 keV (pn gives\nhigher fluxes below 0.7 keV by 10\u221215% with respect to MOS,\nsee Kirsh et al. 2004). We also found our data to be rather un-\ncertain at energies \u22657 keV. Because of the rapid decrease in the\neffective area of the X-ray detectors at energies \u22655 keV the sig-\nnal to noise of the data becomes very low. In addition we know\nthat the particle background is very important at high energies.\nTherefore we restricted our analysis to the 2\u22127 keV energy in-\nterval where we know that our results will not be affected by\ncalibration problems or inaccurate background subtraction.\nMOS and pn stacked spectra were obtained with the fol-\nlowing procedure: suppose we want to add two spectra having\nexposure times t1 and t2, backscales b1 and b2 and response\nmatrices rsp1 and rsp2, and that the corresponding back-\nground extraction regions have exposure times tb1 and tb2\nand backscales bb1 and bb2:\n1. Add spectra: the total backscale will be b1+b212 and the\ntotal exposure time (t1\u00d7b1+t2\u00d7b2)\/(b1+b2).\n2. Add background files: the total backscale\nwill be bb1+bb2 and the total exposure time\n(tb1\u00d7bb1+tb2\u00d7bb2)\/(bb1+bb2).\n3. Add response matrices: the combined response matrix will\nbe (t1\u00d7b1)\u00d7rsp1+(t2\u00d7b2)\u00d7rsp2\/(t1\u00d7b1+t2\u00d7b2).\nThis procedure can be trivially extended to stack any number\nof sources.\n12 Note that we want to extract the XRB from the regions where\nwe have the sources, and therefore, we are accumulating counts in an\nincreasing solid angle.\nS.
