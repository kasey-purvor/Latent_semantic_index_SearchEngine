In addition,\ninterest in linear MR has been rekindled, first by the obser-\nvation of the phenomenon in the silver chalcogenides5,6 and\nthen in a range of ferromagnetic \u201cdirty metals.\u201d7 A classical\ntransport model of a uniform system cannot explain the non-\nsaturating linearity of the resistance in field and various\nmechanisms have been suggested. Broadly, the proposed\nmodels can be divided into three categories; s1d Sample\ninhomogeneities,8,9 s2d geometric boundary effects,10 and s3d\nquantum effects.11,12 Moreover, a geometric technique has\nrecently been shown to massively enhance the low-field MR\nof extraordinary MR sEMRd13 hybrid structures, consisting\nof a metallic inclusion in a semiconductor matrix. In a re-\nlated geometric model, Parish and Littlewood sPLd recently\npredicted8 that the MR of an sN3Md square array of inter-\nconnected conducting regions in an insulating matrix would\nbecome linear and nonsaturating as the array becomes large\nsN ,M \u00f810d. This is promising for high magnetic field sensor\napplications and was proposed8 as the mechanism of the\nlarge linear MR in the silver chalcogenides. Here, we report\nthe use of lithographic techniques to fabricate disk arrays\nfrom a high mobility InSb thin film14 and compare the ob-\nserved MR of these structures to the recent PL predictions,\nthe intrinsic MR, the Corbino15 MR, and to an EMR device\nmade from similar InSb material.\nThe various sample structures we address here are\nshown schematically in Fig. 1. van der Pauw svdPd, Corbino,\nEMR, and disk geometries fabricated from a 1.0 mm thick\nInSb film, that was deposited on semi-insulating GaAss100d\nsubstrates in a molecular-beam epitaxy system with base\npressure of 10\u221210 mbar.14 The PL cloverleaf arrays, and the\nCorbino disk, were fabricated by optical lithography. The\narrays consist of 100 mm diameter circles, connected nomi-\nnally by 6 mm wide and 5 mm long bridges. They were\netched in 45:10:5 lactic acid:nitric acid:HF for 10 s at 30 \u00b0C.\nThe resultant undercut reduced the bridge width to about\n4 mm. Ti:Au was evaporated to provide Ohmic contacts to\nthe disks. Sandblasting was used to shape the \u201cas-grown\u201d\nsample into a cloverleaf. The processing to produce the EMR\ndevice is described in detail elsewhere.16\nMagnetotransport measurements were performed on s1\n31d, s939d, and s10310d arrays, the Corbino disk and the\nas-grown film. The transverse and Hall MRs in magnetic\nfields of up to 8 T were measured at room temperature in a\nsuperconducting magnet, with the sample surface normal to\nadElectronic mail: w.branford@imperial.ac.uk\nFIG. 1.

For the s939d and s10310d ar-\nrays, two current terminals were defined by electrically con-\nnecting all of the resistor units along two opposing edges.\nFor the samples with the current terminals across the full\nwidth, the sheet resistance was determined from the product\nof the measured resistance and the aspect ratio, which is\nunity for N=M. The vdP method was used for the as-grown\nsample and the 131 array, both of which had current point\ncontacts. Some sample geometries led to a weak mixing of\nthe Hall and MR components, which were separated by their\nopposite symmetries with respect to inversion of the mag-\nnetic field.\nThe as-grown film was found to be n type with n\n=1.9531022 m\u22123 and a low-field Hall mobility of mH\n=3.7 m2\/V s at 300 K. The processed single disk gave n\n=2.0131022 m\u22123 and mH=3.8 m2\/V s, which indicates that\nthe processing is not significantly altering the film. The mo-\nbility of the dominant transport carriers was verified with\nmeasurements on the Corbino disk; the low-field MR of\nwhich is given by\nsDR\/R0dC = mH\n2 B2\/f1 + sDr\/r0dg , s1d\nwhere sDR \/R0dC is the Corbino MR, sDr \/r0d is the intrinsic\nMR, and m2B2 is the geometric MR.17 A least-squares fit of\nEq. s1d to the measured low-field is shown in the inset of Fig.\n2 and yields m=3.5 m2\/V s in good agreement with the Hall\nresult. Also shown in Fig. 2 are the transverse MR of the\nas-grown cloverleaf, the s131d disk, and the Corbino disk.\nTo test whether sDR \/R0dvdP= sDr \/r0d, we reproduce\nsDR \/R0dC from Eq. s1d, using only parameters measured on\nthe as-grown vdP sample. In this material, the Hall mobility,\nmH=dsRHd \/RhdB, where Rh is zero field sheet resistance, is\na nontrivial function of field, and its measured dependence is\nplotted in the left hand inset to Fig. 3. The experimental\ncurves of mHsBd and sDR \/R0dvdPsBd were combined as in Eq.\ns1d, and the predicted MRC is plotted as the dotted line in the\nmain body of Fig. 2. The predicted line is in excellent agree-\nment with the experimental data in low field, and in reason-\nable agreement in high field. Thus, sDR \/R0dvdP= sDr \/r0d is a\nreasonable assumption.\nThe intrinsic MR of semiconductors can be described18\nas a power series in mB\nDr\/r0 = aumBu + bsmBd2. s2d\nThis power series can be substituted into Eq. s1d, giving the\nCorbino magnetorestance in\nsDR\/R0dC = m2B2\/f1 + aumBu + bsmBd2g . s3d\nThe limits of Eq. s3d are very instructive for high-field\nMR sensor properties. If the sensor material has a linear\nintrinsic MR, i.e., aumBu@1, bsmBd2, then sDR \/R0dC\n=mB \/a. If, on the other hand, there is a significant quadratic\nterm in sDr \/r0d, i.e., bsmBd2@aumBu, 1, the MR will satu-\nrate and sDR \/R0dC=1\/b. For example, in our as-grown film\na \/b=41.7, hence, the Corbino MR should saturate at B\n@12 T. Thus, for linear sDr \/r0d, sDR \/R0dC will also be lin-\near and unsaturating, with magnitude inversely proportional\nto that of sDr \/r0d. Even in our InSb film, which has a very\nlarge sDr \/r0d, sDR \/R0dC in the linear limit gives a massive\nenhancement to the intrinsic MR, dsDR \/R0dC \/dB=4.9\/T,\nam=0.69 T\u22121. The material we have studied is representative\nof micron-thick InSb epilayers on GaAs s001d. sSee Table I\nfor a summary of InSb MR properties for samples from a\nrange of sources.d Hence, the ideal material for a linear MR\nsensor in a standard geometry would have a large mobility\nand a small sthough very lineard sDr \/r0d.\nIn the vdP samples fcloverleaf and s131d diskg, the\nsDr \/r0d should dominate. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that,\nalthough the vdP MR of the film is large, sDR \/R0dvdPs8 Td\n=885%, it is dwarfed by sDR \/R0dCs8 Td=4685%. Moreover,\nthe low-field response of the Corbino device is greatly sur-\npassed by the EMR device with filling factor 12\/16th as\nshown in the inset of Fig. 2. Furthermore, neither sDR \/R0dC\nnor sDR \/R0dvdP show any sign of saturating by 8 T. In the\ncase of sDR \/R0dC, this is better illustrated in the left inset of\nFig. 3 by the derivative with respect to field dsDR \/R0dC \/dB,\nwhich shows a maximum at the crossover from low-field to\nhigh-field dominated MR at 0.9 T, and reaches a constant\nhigh-field limit above 6 T of dsDR \/R0dC \/dB=490% \/T, in-\ndicating that sDR \/R0dC is linear in B between 6 T and 8 T.\nConsider now the MR of the disk arrays relative to the\nstandard other geometries addressed here. If the bulk resis-\ntivity of the disks were the dominant resistance, then the\nFIG. 2.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/apl.aip.org\/apl\/copyright.jsp\nsheet resistance of an sN3Nd square array would be inde-\npendent of N. Note from Table I that the sheet resistance of\nthe large arrays is nearly an order of magnitude larger than\nthat of the vdP samples. This indicates that the zero-field\nresistance is dominated by the InSb bridges between disks,\nrather than the disks themselves. The transverse MR of the\ns939d and s10310d arrays is compared to the vdP samples\nin Fig. 3. Clearly, the MR of our processed arrays is de-\ncreased relative to the vdP geometry, which is not surprising\ngiven the large extra term in the zero-field resistance from\nbottlenecking at the bridges. As a phenomenological test of\nhow the disk structure influences the linear and quadratic\nMR terms, the MR of the 131, 939, and 10310 arrays\nwas fit to Eq. s2d so that the relative size of the linear and\nquadratic components can be compared.\nThe parameters a and b obtained from this procedure\nare given in Table I. The ratio a \/b gives an indication of the\n\u201clinearity\u201d of the MR. This shows that the 939 and 10\n310 arrays have a significantly increased linear component\nrelative to the single disk. However, even in the single disk,\nthe MR is much closer to linear than quadratic, and there is\nno evidence of saturation by 8 T. Both the 939 and 10\n310 arrays are slightly superlinear. We note that the param-\neters a and b of the single disk are greater at 1.5 K than at\nroom temperature, although the MR sright hand inset to Fig.\n3d is smaller because the mobility decreases to 0.9 m2\/V s.\nCalculations by Arora11 predicted linear MR for para-\nbolic semiconductors in the high-field squantumd limit19 and\na slight superlinearity for a nonparabolic InSb conduction\nband.11 However, the similarity of the MR at 1.5 K and room\ntemperature suggests that it is not a phonon-dominated pro-\ncess. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that the PL model\nfor large arrays describes the intrinsic linear MR behavior of\nthe unprocessed InSb rather well, as is shown in the right\nhand inset to Fig. 3 particularly at room temperature. We\nstress that this represents generic InSb behavior and is not\nspecific to our samples.\nOne of the initial aims of this work was to test the PL\nmodel. InSb was chosen because of its high mobility, and use\nas a commercial MR sensor. However, in the PL model, the\nbridges have negligible resistance, whereas our disks have\nhigh resistance interconnects. While our arrays do not per-\nfectly reproduce the PL model, a comparison is still worth-\nwhile.\nThe PL model predicts that for small arrays sN,10d, the\nMR will saturate in high field sbe sublinear in Bd when N is\nodd and will not saturate sit will be superlinear in Bd when N\nis even. Moreover, for both odd and even N, the MR is\npredicted to become more linear as N increases, and collapse\nonto the same straight line as N tends to infinity sodd from\nabove, and even from belowd. We do observe the increasing\nlinearity with increasing N, which is of considerable interest\nif the disk structures can be exploited in the Corbino geom-\netry. However, we do not observe either sublinearity for odd\narrays or a boost in the MR over the vdP geometry, as pre-\ndicted. The high resistance interconnects are the likely\nsource of the deviations from the model predictions.\nThe authors thank M. Parish and P.
