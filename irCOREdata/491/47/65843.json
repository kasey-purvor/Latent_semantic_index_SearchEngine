After carefully accounting for bimolecular triplet annihilation and knowing the independently\nmeasured solid state inter-system-crossing yield of the polymer, a singlet generation yield of 44% is\nobtained, in the working device, which is clearly in excess of the simple quantum statistical 25% limit.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevLett.97.076602 PACS numbers: 72.80.Le, 71.35.Cc, 72.10.\u0001d, 72.20.Ht\nThe most important unanswered question in the field of\norganic light-emitting devices is the physical nature of the\nspin dependency of charge recombination [1], which de-\ntermines the singlet formation yield and thus emerges as\none of the key parameters that determines the total device\nefficiency and critically determines which device architec-\nture should be chosen for optimum performance. Quantum\nmechanical spin statistics predicts that only 25% of charge\nrecombination events will give rise to the formation of a\nsinglet exciton, the rest will be triplet excitons. However, in\nthe case of delocalized excitations on polymers, the re-\ncombination could become spin dependent, leading di-\nrectly to a departure from this limit. Several indirect\nmeasurements of this formation ratio have produced wide-\nspread values ranging from the spin independent value of\n25% up to 95% [2\u20138]. However, from recent experimental\nevidence it has become clear that the majority of these\nearlier measurements on polymers are based on incorrect\nassumptions or require absolute values of many quantities\nthat are difficult to obtain. For example, the origins of the\nsignals used as the basis of magnetic resonance measure-\nments [2], which initially attracted considerable attention,\nhave been seriously challenged [9]. Other studies have\ntried to determine the relative singlet to triplet yield by\nemploying emissive acceptors [5,7]. These, however, are\nnot measurements on the pristine polymer either and un-\ncertainties remain as to what extent the inter-system-\ncrossing rate, \u0001ISC, in such doped systems is still a mean-\ningful constant [10]. Apart from such indirect approaches,\nexperiments that directly probe the two products of the\ncharge carrier recombination, i.e., the singlet and triplet\nexciton, are generally more convincing and transparent [4].\nBut again, any attempts to determine absolute values are\ncertainly unrealistic for reasons we shall highlight in the\nfollowing section [3,6,8]. Instead, relative measurements\nare deemed to be the superior method and one general\napproach is outlined as follows.\nGenerally, we can define two parameters, S and T, to\ndenote any experimentally measurable signals that are\nproportional to the singlet and triplet generation rates\nwhereby each ci denotes the appropriate constant of pro-\nportionality. The superscripts distinguish electrical (el)\nfrom optical (opt) excitation. Given that a certain electrical\n(optical) excitation causes an overall exciton formation I,\nthen the notionally observed signals are given as:\n Sopt \u0002 coptS IoptS \u00031\u0001 \u0001ISC\u0004; Topt \u0002 coptT IoptT \u0001ISC;\nSel \u0002 celS IelS \u0002\u00031\u0001 \u0001ISC\u0004;\nTel \u0002 celT IelT \u00011\u0001 \u0002\u00031\u0001 \u0001ISC\u0004\u0002;\nwith \u0002 being the singlet generation yield. By using the\nsame excitation conditions for the singlet and triplet mea-\nsurements, i.e., IoptS \u0002 IoptT and IelS \u0002 IelT one can measure T\nrelative to S:\n \nTopt\nSopt\n\u0002 c\nopt\nT\ncoptS\n\u0001ISC\n\u00031\u0001 \u0001ISC\u0004 ;\nTel\nSel\n\u0002 c\nel\nT\ncelS\n1\u0001 \u0002\u00031\u0001 \u0001ISC\u0004\n\u0002\u00031\u0001 \u0001ISC\u0004 :\nIn this case neither the driving current, including dark\ncurrents, nor the optical excitation dose need to be known.\nFurthermore, if Sopt (or Topt, respectively) is probed under\nthe same conditions as Sel (or Tel), then coptS \u0002 celS (coptT \u0002\ncelT ) and one measures the electrically excited signals rela-\ntive to the corresponding optical ones:\n \nTel\nSel\n=\nTopt\nSopt\n\u0002 1\u0001 \u0002\u00031\u0001 \u0001\nISC\u0004\n\u0002\u0001ISC\n: (1)\nHere the absolute value of only one parameter, namely, the\ninter-system-crossing yield, \u0001ISC, is required in order to\ncalculate the singlet formation yield, \u0002. Equation (1) is true\nfor any optical excitation combined with any electrical one\nas long as (i) all signals depend linearly on excitation,\n(ii) the corresponding T and S signals are excited the\nsame way, and (iii) the corresponding el and opt signals\nare measured the same way. The latter two points are rather\nmild conditions and can easily be satisfied within a simple\nexperimental layout. The last point, in particular, could be\nrewritten: the same density of excitons leads to the same\nsignal at the detector. Thus, by no means do we need to\ncount all excitons, for example, the light out-coupling\nefficiency is no issue here [11]. Also this condition ac-\ncounts for all exciton quenching mechanisms as long as\nPRL 97, 076602 (2006) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending18 AUGUST 2006\n0031-9007=06=97(7)=076602(4) 076602-1 \u00a9 2006 The American Physical Society\nthey apply in the same way for optically and electrically\nexcited excitons. This covers most of the common mecha-\nnisms such as quenching at the anodes or impurity sites\nincluding the well-known keto defect [12].\nHowever, of most relevance is the first point, an implicit\ncondition that applies to all previous work based on relative\nsinglet and triplet measurements that in fact is not easily\nsatisfied. Recall Eq. (1) holds for any pair of signals, T and\nS, as long as both depend linearly on excitation dose.\nClearly, the most natural choice for S is the fluorescence\nintensity as it is easy to measure and for sufficiently low\npower depends linearly on excitation dose. But what is a\ngood measure of the triplet signal, T? One may consider\ntransient absorption [4,13] or emission (phosphorescence)\ndetection [4,14]. However, both techniques require rather\nlarge excitation densities to yield decent signal-to-noise\nratios, which makes migration activated triplet-triplet an-\nnihilation (TTA) the major decay route [15,16]. The situ-\nation becomes (relatively) worse at higher temperature,\nbecause the triplet mobility increases\u2014at room tempera-\nture triplet excitons decay essentially only by TTA, i.e.,\nwithout any phosphorescence emission. This nonlinear\nloss mechanism for triplet excitons is in fact the reason\nwhy many previous studies drastically underestimated the\ntriplet generation channel relative to that of the singlet and\nthereby obtained excitation dose dependent (interpreted as\nelectric field dependent) singlet exciton generation rates as\nhigh as 95% [3\u20135].\nHaving concluded that both emission and transient ab-\nsorption detection are not ideal measurements for the\ntriplet, we still have to rely on them because there are no\nconvincing alternatives. Given this, we need to be aware of\nthe problems associated with this and must account for\nthem in a comprehensive way.\nFor our measurements we used encapsulated, state-of-\nthe-art diodes based on a blue-emitting polyspirobifluorene\npolymer (see inset of Fig. 1 for chemical structure [13]),\nwhich were mounted in an optically and electrically ac-\ncessible closed cycle helium cryostat. The triplet accumu-\nlation was probed by observing the change in the transient\nabsorption as a function of the time during a 1 ms excita-\ntion pulse. Without any alternations in the geometry of the\nspectrometer, the latter could either be electrically applied\nusing a 100 W current pulse generator, or optically, using a\n405 nm laser diode. Additionally, a 780 nm probe beam\nwas focused onto the active area of the device, reflected by\nthe cathode, passed through an appropriate cutoff filter,\ndetected by a 200 MHz transimpedance amplifier, and\nmonitored by a 1 GHz oscilloscope. Up to 1000 excitations\nwere averaged for a single data set with a repetition fre-\nquency of only 0.3 Hz in order to allow for sufficient triplet\ndecay between the excitation pulses. The fluorescence\nlevel was simultaneously observed by using a second\nphotodiode. Details are given elsewhere [13].\nGiven in Fig. 1 is a brief spectroscopic characterization\nof the polymer including absorption, electroluminescence,\nelectrophosphorescence, and excited triplet state absorp-\ntion. All experiments were performed at 20 K, as this\nreduces the triplet migration although it certainly cannot\navoid triplet-triplet annihilation altogether [16]. Figure 2\nshows two typical transient absorption data sets for optical\nand electrical excitation. Here, we observe the build-in of\nthe triplet excitons as a function of time during a 1 ms\nelectrical excitation pulse. Clearly, TTA affects the ob-\nserved data, which manifests itself in both the saturation\nof the induced absorption signal and the rapid decay of the\ntriplet density in the absence of excitation compared to the\nlong radiative lifetime of the triplet exciton, \u00051 s [15,16].\n1.2 1.6 2.0 2.4 2.8 3.2 3.6 4.0 4.4 4.8\n1000 800 700 600 500 400 300\n(d) (c) (b)\nEnergy (eV)\n(a)\nOO\nO O\n* *\nCH3\nCH3CH3\nCH3\nCH3\nCH3\nCH3\nn\nCH3\n Wavelength (nm)\nFIG. 1 (color online).

(1) one cannot employ the\ntransient triplet absorption intensity at any time after exci-\ntation, because there is no regime where the signal depends\nlinearly on time, which in our case parameterizes excita-\ntion dose. Instead, a good measure for T is the rise of the\ntime-resolved transient triplet absorption signal at time\nzero, as here TTA is not yet active. As an alternative to a\nsignal that is proportional to the actual (time-dependent)\ntriplet density, we employ the rate of growth of such a\nsignal, which satisfies Eq. (1), as it is still directly propor-\ntional to the triplet generation rate. A straightforward way\nto acquire this slope, which is completely independent of\nthe exact mechanism of TTA, would be to extrapolate the\nfirst derivative of the measured data sets back to zero time.\nHowever, given the noise level, it is much more accurate to\nsimulate the experimental data by an appropriate model\nthat accounts for TTA and in that way exploit the whole\ndata set. The starting point is the rate equation for the\ntriplet accumulation without the monomolecular decay\nterm, which is legitimate, because the considered time\nframe (1 ms) is much shorter than the triplet exciton life-\ntime, \u00051 s. If, under certain continuous excitation condi-\ntions, the triplet generation rate is IT then the measured\nsignal intensity is given by\n \ndT\u0003t\u0004\ndt\n\u0002 1\ncT\n\u0006IT \u0001 \u0003TTc2T\u0001T\u0003t\u0004\u00022\u0007;\nT\u0003t\u0004 \u0002 1\ncT\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nIT\n\u0003TT\ns\ntanh\u0003t \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001IT\u0003TTp \u0004;\n(2)\nwith \u0003TT being the TTA constant. However, both for\nelectrical and optical excitation the excitons are not homo-\ngeneously formed throughout the sample depth. This is\nobvious for photoexcitation, but also for electrical excita-\ntion the dissimilar mobilities of the charge carriers creates\na recombination zone near to the electrode that injects the\nslower moving charges [17]. Given that the triplet excitons\nare nearly immobile at these low temperatures [16] they\ncannot compensate for this inhomogeneity by migration.\nTherefore, in a more realistic scenario, such inhomogene-\nous excitation is included in the model by using exponen-\ntial excitation profiles with characteristic inverse\nthicknesses \u0004opt and \u0004el, respectively,\n \ndT\u0003x; t\u0004\ndt\n\u0002 1\ncT\n\u0006IT\u0004e\u0001\u0004x \u0001 \u0003TTc2T\u0001T\u0003x; t\u0004\u00022\u0007;\nT\u0003t\u0004 \u0002 1\ncT\n2\nta\nlncosh\u0003t \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001ITap \u0004 with a \u0002 \u0003TT\u0004:\n(3)\nFor each data set, both models rely on only two free fitting\nparameters [ 1cTa and ITa for Eq. (3)] with\nIT\ncT\n\u0002 dTdt for t \u0002 0\nbeing the desired quantity. Indeed, accounting for the in-\nhomogeneous exciton generation results in a much im-\nproved fit of the experimental data, which can only really\nbe appreciated in the semilogarithmical presentation of the\ninset of Fig. 2. The instantaneous slope obtained according\nto Eq. (3) is shown as a dashed line. A more detailed\nanalysis of this model and determination of the charge\ncarrier recombination layer, \u0004el, in working devices, to-\ngether with further physical justification of the model, can\nbe found in Ref. [13].\nCompared to this rather involved method for the mea-\nsurement of the triplet excitons, the singlet signal, S, can\ndirectly be obtained by measuring the fluorescence levels.\nProvided the applied electric field strength is sufficiently\nlow (<6\b 105 V=cm22), then for both kinds of excitation\nthese signals are truly time independent and directly pro-\nportional to the singlet generation rates, which is easily\nshown as the individual optically and electrically excited\nsignals perfectly add up to the simultaneously excited one,\ni.e., the optically excited fluorescence contribution in the\npresence of the electrical excitation is unchanged. This\nproves that for the excitation conditions applied here the\nsinglet exciton is neither quenched by the electric field nor\nby polarons.\nEquation (1) holds true for any combination of optical\nand electrical excitation dose. Thus, the singlet generation\nyield could be calculated from a single pair of data sets\nsuch as those given in Fig. 2. However, it is more informa-\ntive to investigate a range of excitation doses. Any non-\nlinear dependence of T on S [which is not covered by the\ndefinitions leading to Eq. (1)] would indicate a nonconstant\nsinglet generation yield, for example, a dependency on\ndriving conditions. Otherwise we could average all the\ndata sets taken at various excitation, i.e., determining the\nslopes Tel\nSel\n\u0003Iel\u0004 and ToptSopt \u0003Iopt\u0004. In Fig. 3 the experimentally\nobtained triplet signals under various excitation doses are\n10-3 10-2 10-1 100 101\n10-2\n10-1\n100\n101\n102\n103\nT \n(V\n\/s)\nS (V)\n el\n opt\nFIG. 3 (color online). Dependency of the rise of the transient\ntriplet absorption signal (T) on its corresponding fluorescence\nlevel (S) for electrical and optical excitation on a double loga-\nrithmical scale. The two solid lines are least-squares fits of the\noffset of a strictly linear dependency.\nPRL 97, 076602 (2006) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending18 AUGUST 2006\n076602-3\nplotted versus their corresponding singlet levels for both\nexcitation modes. 0:3 V=s is approximately the detection\nlimit for the transient absorption, which corresponds to\n1:5 mW=cm2 optical and 5.0 V electrical excitation. On\nthe other hand, the largest optical slope is limited by the\nmaximum available laser power, 30 mW=cm2. Electrical\nexcitation data are included only up to 7.7 V as for higher\nvoltages effects of sample heating induced by the large\ndriving currents were observed. The graph shows that at the\nsame singlet density about 10 times more triplets are\ngenerated for electrical as compared to optical excitation.\nCritically, both data sets are well described by a linear\nfunction with slope of \t1 in this double logarithmical\npresentation which implies that both electrically and opti-\ncally excited triplet densities depend linearly on their\ncorresponding singlet densities. Thus, the singlet genera-\ntion yield is a true constant and, in contrast to recent reports\n[3,4], there is no electric field dependence. In this case we\ncan average our data and the two solid lines are a least-\nsquares fit with only one free parameter, which is the\noffset; the slope was fixed to\t1. This yields Tel\nSel\n\u0002 0:069\n\n0:002 and ToptSopt \u0002 0:0058\n 0:0002 for electrical and opti-\ncal excitation, respectively, and, consequently, a ratio of\n11:9\n 0:8.\nIn order to arrive at an absolute singlet generation yield\nwe need to know the absolute triplet formation yield for\noptical excitation, importantly, at the same experimental\nconditions, i.e., low temperature and solid state. An exact\nmethod to achieve this is the observation of the ground\nstate recovery of the photobleaching where the ratio of the\ninitial transient absorption (all excitons) to the long-lived\nplateau (any long-lived excitations presumably mainly\ntriplets) directly corresponds to the triplet generation yield\n[18]. In doing this with sub-pico-second time resolution\nand very low excitation doses a value of \u0001ISC \u0002 0:12\n\n0:02 is found for polyspirobifluorene in solid state at low\ntemperature, whereby the large error margins cover poten-\ntial influences from polaron formation, see Ref. [19] for\ndetails. Given this, Eq. (1) yields an absolute singlet for-\nmation yield of \u0002 \u0002 0:44\n 0:04.\nWe reached this conclusion from directly measuring the\nrelative singlet and triplet populations after charge re-\ncombination in a working device. In addition, we avoided\nthe ambiguity of many previous studies that measured\ntriplet quantities, as we did a careful account for TTA.\nFurthermore, our measurements are also free from other\nphenomena related to the presence of photo-oxidation\nproducts in the polymers or dopants such as heavy metals\nor heavy metal containing complexes. This result comes\nfrom a pure homopolymer and represents the intrinsic\npolymer singlet formation yield for this polymer. Finally,\na singlet generation yield higher than 25% implies it to be a\nmaterial rather than a generic property. Beyond doubt, the\npolymer investigated here is not the one with the highest\nvalue and a systematic search for better polymers would\ncertainly be worth the effort.\n*Corresponding author.\nElectronic address: carsten.rothe@dur.ac.uk\n[1] K.
