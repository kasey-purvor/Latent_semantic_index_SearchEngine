Introduction \nThe research of increased stiffness, but low-density material is a key point for several \nindustries especially for aerospace, since structural weight reduction is a very efficient means \nof improving aircraft performance. The research of more advanced materials with high \nspecific properties is therefore mandatory for such industry. Li-Al alloys are among the \ncandidate materials because the addition of lithium to aluminium reduce the overall alloy\u2019s \nweight (1 wt% Li added to Al reduces the density by 3%) and increases the elastic modulus. \nFurthermore, fatigue crack resistance in Al-Li alloys is high; allowing the use of such alloy as \nimportant structural material. In contrast to new materials systems such as fibre-reinforced \ncomposites, Li-Al alloys do not require large capital investments in new fabricating facilities, \nresulting in being more cost effective than composites in some applications. However, these \nmaterials exhibit poor corrosion resistance, suffering several types of degradation (exfoliation, \npitting, intergranular and intersubgranular corrosion, etc..) that strongly limits their usage in \nhostile environments [1]. The reason for such corrosion weakness is mainly due to the \npresence of precipitate phases such as Al3Li that are characterised by a different potential with \nrespect to the surrounding matrix, driving localized corrosion phenomena. The corrosion \nresistance of Li-Al alloys can be improved using chromate conversion layers or corrosion \ninhibitors such as rare earth salts [2]. However, these treatments are toxic or expensive, \nespecially taking into account the recycling cost of the materials so treated at the end of their \nservice life. In order to find a non toxic and cost effective way to improve their corrosion \nproperties, this study considers covering the surface with a pure aluminium layer capable of \nshielding the precipitate phases from aggressive environment and therefore avoiding the onset \nof corrosion. The advantage of using an aluminium coating is principally due to 3 main \nfactors: (1) It is a lightweight metal, therefore it does not increase the overall density \nsignificantly, (2) its crystalline structure is very similar to the substrate avoiding lattice\u2019s \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 3 \nmismatch that in some cases could drive the detachment of the coatings, (3) aluminium is a \nprimary alloy element, therefore the material can be easily recycled without any purification \nprocess. Lab-scale electrodeposition of aluminium from ionic liquids has been known for a \nfew years [3-6] and recently commercial metals and alloys such as mild steel, brass and \nmagnesium have been successfully Al-plated [7-9]. It has been also demonstrated that the \ncoatings obtained from ionic liquid electroplating bath can effectively enhance the corrosion \nresistance of the substrate materials [9,10] owing to the ability of aluminium to form a stable \noxide film on its surface. To the best of our knowledge electroplating of Li-Al has never been \nattempted, principally for the difficulties to remove the oxides layer that spontaneously form \non the surface. In this work we present the results of our attempt to obtain homogeneous \naluminium layer on P90 Li-Al alloy. Finally, we obtained good quality coatings and, for the \nfirst time, we investigated the corrosion properties of such composite materials via \nelectrochemical techniques. The results were compared with bare P90 alloy and pure \naluminium. \n \n2. Experimental \n \nThe material studied is a commercial Al-Li alloy (namely P90) whose composition is 2.96% \nLi, 0.04% Fe, 0.089% Zr and Al balance. From a bar (16 mm diameter) thin disks were cut (4 \nmm thick) and polished with SiC paper down to 1200 grit in order to achieve a smooth and \nreproducible surface. The plating process was carried out inside a nitrogen filled glove box \n(Iteco mod 10A), where the water and oxygen content was kept below 5 ppm. The \nelectroplating bath was constituted by 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium heptachloroaluminate \n[BMIm]Al2Cl7 (BMImCl\u00f7AlCl3 molar ratio 1\u00f72), supplied by Merck and used as received \nwithout further purification. The deposits were produced in current controlled (galvanostatic) \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 4 \nconditions at room temperature, using an anode of pure aluminium foil (Goodfellow 99.9%). \nOnce the electroplating process was terminated the samples were cleaned, inside the glove \nbox, with acetone (Normapur, VWR Prolabo) in order to remove the main part of the ILs, and \nthen cleaned in open air with several rinses of deionised water. The morphology of the \ncoatings was investigated by optical (Nikon Eclipse LV150) and Scanning Elecron \nmicroscopy (ISI 100B), while the chemical composition was determined by Energy Dispersive \nX-Ray Microanalysis (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The EDX \nmeasurements were obtained using a NORAN NSS 300 detector fitting the peaks with \nGaussian type curves, applying the Proza (Phi-Rho-Z) correction method. XPS experiments \nwere performed in an ultra-high vacuum (10\n-9\n mbar) system equipped with a VSW HAC 5000 \nhemispherical electron energy analyser at 90\u00b0 respect to the sample, and a non-\nmonochromatized Al-K\u03b1 X-ray source (1486.6 eV). The source power was 300 W (15 kV\u00d720 \nmA) and the spectra were acquired in the constant-pass-energy mode at Epas = 44 eV. The \noverall energy resolution was 1.2 eV as a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) for the Ag \n3d5\/2 line of a pure silver reference. No neutralizer was utilized and the spectra energy scale \nwas corrected using the adventious C 1s peak (284.8 eV). The recorded spectra were fitted \nusing XPSPeak 4.1 software. Gauss-Lorentz curves were used to fit the data after subtraction \nof a Shirley-type background. \nThe electrochemical characterization was performed using a potentiostat PAR model 2273 \ncontrolled by PowerSuite 2.58 software. The cell used was a EG&G PARC Flat Cell using the \nthree electrode set-up with the working electrode surface of 1.0 cm\n2\n, a Pt grid and a standard \ncalomel electrode (SCE) were used as counter (CE) and reference (RE) electrodes \nrespectively. The RE was separated from the solution with an ion conducting glass frit. The \ncorrosion experiments were carried out at room temperature (20\u00b12\u00baC) in aerated 3.5 wt% \nNaCl solution. All the samples were kept in the saline solution for at least 20 h before carrying \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 5 \nout the impedance (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization (PD) experiments in order to allow \nthe stabilization of the system. During this time the open circuit voltage (OCV) was recorded. \nThe EIS spectra were measured in the frequency range between 1 MHz and 10 mHz, sampling \ntwenty frequencies per decade, at the OCV, applying a sinusoidal perturbation of \u00b110mV. The \nPD curves were recorded starting from -0.250 V respect to the OCV at the scan rate of 0.3 \nmVs\n-1\n. \n \n3. Results and discussion \n \n3.1. Sample surface\u2019s treatment. \nDue to the high reactivity of the metals constituting the alloy in the atmospheric conditions, \nthe sample\u2019s surface is characterised by the unavoidable presence of an oxidation layer. In \nfigure 1 is shown the wide scan XPS spectra, obtained on a 1200 grit polished P90 samples. \nApart from the adventious carbon, always presents in samples exposed to atmosphere, the \nsample\u2019s surface is constituted by aluminium, lithium, carbon and oxygen. (see also the insets \nof figure 1). The binding energy values of these peaks, summarised in table 1, are consistent \nwith the presence at the surface of aluminium oxides\/hydroxides and lithium carbonate. The \nthickness of such layer is quite high, at least higher than the probe depth of the technique \n(about 6 nm at 1450 eV [13]), as argued by the absence of the signal attributable to metallic \nAl. Attempts to deposit aluminium onto these samples always resulted in inhomogeneous \ncoatings. Aluminium grew only as islands scattered on the surface, leaving the main part of \nthe sample unplated (figure 2). Surface treatments, performed outside the glove box, aimed to \nremove this layer were attempted but proved useless. If exposed to air, in few seconds, the \nalloy is capable of forming an alteration layer thick enough to prevent the homogeneous \nelectrodeposition. Electrochemical etching, carried on directly in the ionic liquid inside the \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 6 \nglove box, were attempted by applying a positive potential (up to 1V vs pure Al wire as \nreference) for times varying from 20 second up to 2 minutes, but the results were also not \nsatisfactory. Instead, polishing the samples by 1200 SiC paper inside the glove box, leaves the \nsurface clean enough to allow the electrodeposition of a dense, homogeneous and well \nadhering aluminium layer (figure 3a and 3b). \n \n \n3.2 Characterization of the Al coatings. \n \nIn order to avoid possible corrosion of the alloy by the Al(III) the electrodeposition process \nwas carried out immediately after the immersion of the sample in the electroplating bath and \ncontinued for two hours at constant current density (10 mA.cm\n-2\n). These conditions proved to \nrepresent a good compromise between the electroplating time and the coating\u2019s quality. Infact, \nshorter time lead to the formation of too thin a coating while, due to the preferential growth of \nsome crystallographic faces, the roughness of the deposits strongly increases with the amount \nof aluminium electrodeposited [10]. The coating is shown to be quite adhering to the substrate \nas determined by passing the sellotape strip test, and their thickness was evaluated by cross \nsections examination (see the figure 3a) as 24\u00b14 \u00b5m. Edge effects were observed but these \nrelative effects were negligible, never exceeded 20%. EDX analyses of the coatings, (figure \n3c), are characterised by the presence of only two peaks; the main one attributable to the \naluminium and a second one, barely detectable, to the oxygen. Peaks due to the contribution \nof others elements, such as chlorides, that were expected to be present as contaminations \nderiving from the electroplating bath, are not detectable, therefore their content is under the \ndetection limit for this technique, in accordance with the previously obtained results on \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 7 \nsimilar ionic liquids [7-10] permitting us to infer the coating constituted almost pure \naluminium.  \n \n \n3.3 Electrochemical corrosion tests \n \nThe effectiveness of the coatings as corrosion protection against wet corrosion was then \nextensively examined by OCV, EIS and potentiodynamic polarization measurements in \naerated 3.5 wt% NaCl aqueous solution. \n \n3.3.1 Open circuit voltage curves  \nThe open circuit voltage curves (OCVs) were recorded as a function of time for up to 20 hours \nof immersion time in order to achieve a stable value. Figure 4 shows examples of the curves \nobtained for the pure aluminium (a), the Al-plated (b) and the bare P90 alloy (c) respectively. \nThe curves obtained on pure Al and Al-plated P90 samples are characterised by an initial \nperiod of time where the potential shifts towards a more negative value. This behaviour, \ntypical for aluminium in contact with chloride containing solution [14] has been attributed to \nthe degradation of the alumina layer via the formation of nanopores and the adsorption of Cl\n-\n \nions [15,16]. The induction time varies between 2 and 8 hours, probably due to the slightly \ndifferent thicknesses and degrees of hydration of the alumina layer spontaneously formed as \nsoon as the Al is exposed to air. After this time the potential reached almost a constant value \nof -1.0V for the pure Al and -1.15V for the Al-plated P90. Vice versa, the shape of the curves \nrecorded on the bare P90 sample is much less defined (fig 4c). After an initial shift towards \nmore negative value analogous to the previously depicted, the potential remains randomly \noscillating, even after several hours of exposition (Figure 4c) indicating a more active \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 8 \nbehaviour. However, also for the P90 sample is possible to identify a plateau close to the \nvalue of -1.25V vs. SCE. This value is more negative than the pure aluminium, and the Al-\nplated, confirming the thermodynamic tendencies of the P90 alloy to be corroded and, at the \nsame time demonstrate that the thin pure aluminium coating significantly contributes to \nmitigate this effect.  \n \n3.3.2 Impedance spectra \nThe EIS data for these samples were recorded to further evaluate their corrosion resistance. In \nfigure 5a is shown the Bode plots for the Al-plated P90, compared to the bare alloy and pure \naluminium. The coated samples display behaviour very close to the pure aluminium while the \nuncoated sample shows a much lower resistance.  A better insight into the corrosion properties \nof the coating can be achieved by plotting this data in the form of Nyquist diagrams (figure \n5b). The experimental data show an arc-like behaviour over the frequency range examined \nand the diameter of the semicircles increase from the bare P90 (detectable only in the inset of \nfigure 5b) to the Al-plated and pure aluminium samples. These measures unequivocally show \nthe polarization resistance (Rp) increases for the Al-coated samples, which in turn, is \nassociated with a decrease in corrosion rate [17]. \n \n3.3.3 Potentiodynamic polarization curves \nSome other important information, such as the ability of the material to spontaneously \npassivate, the potential region over which the specimen remain passive and the corrosion \ncurrent density (icorr) can be obtained from the recording of the potentiodynamic polarization \n(PD) curves. Examples of these curves of both the plated and unplated P90 samples are shown \nin figure 6 compared with pure aluminium. As previously pointed out for the OCVs, it can be \nseen that the curves obtained on pure aluminium and the Al-plated P90 samples, even thought \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 9 \nslightly variable in the absolute value, are characterised by a similar shape, indicating, on the \nwhole, close analogies in the corrosion behaviour for these samples. These curves present a \nwide passive region extending from the corrosion potential (Ecorr) to nearly -0.7V, \ncharacterised by a relative small anodic dissolution current, followed by a sudden rising of the \ncurrent, due to the breaking down of the alumina protective layer and the start of pitting \ncorrosion. This behaviour has been already reported in literature for aluminium alloys and can \nbe considered typical for aluminium in chlorides solution [10, 18, 19].  \nAccordingly to the OCV curves the corrosion potential shifts towards more negative value \nstarting from the pure Al samples to the Al-plated and the bare P90 sample that presents the \nmost negative corrosion potential value (-1.2V vs. SCE). The corrosion current density (icorr), \nwas qualitatively extrapolated superimposing a straight line along the most linear portion of \nthe PD curve. The interception of this line at the corrosion potential gives the icorr value (see \nthe example displayed in the inset of figure 6). For these measures we chose to consider only \nthe cathodic branch because in the anodic one the surface is changing due to the corrosion \nprocess. Bare P90 samples always shown the highest corrosion current density (about 17 \n\u00b5A.cm\n-2\n) while the pure aluminium and the Al-plated P90 were characterised by values of \nabout one order of magnitude lower (table 2). The reason of the variability between pure Al \nand Al-plated P90 samples is related to the sample\u2019s surface roughness variability. As \npreviously reported [10] the surface of the deposits, electrochemically grown from this type of \nILs, are quite rough and the roughness quickly increase with the amount of deposed metal. For \ncoatings of about 24 \u00b5m this phenomenon is still moderate, however, the increase in the \nexposed surface due to the enhanced roughness is not neglectable. Unfortunately, it is not \npossible to accurately control this characteristic; therefore the evaluation of the corrosion \ncurrent can be deduced only qualitatively. In the light of these considerations, the little \ndifferences between the Al and Al-plated P90 samples that have been presented are not be \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 10 \nconsidered to be significant. In contrast, the current for the bare P90 samples always results to \nbe about one order of magnitude higher. Therefore, even if the icorr are not directly comparable \nbecause the exposed surface for the plated samples can not be measured and therefore is \nunknown, this data demonstrates that the P90 sample in contact with NaCl solution undergoes \nmore rapid anodic dissolution while in the Al-plated case this process is strongly reduced, \nbehaving almost like pure aluminium.  \n \n \n \n4. Conclusions \nThe present work shows that the corrosion resistance of P90 aluminium\u2013lithium alloy can be \ngreatly improved by coating the material with a thin layer of pure aluminium electroplated \nfrom ionic liquid. From the 1-butyl-3methyl imidazolium heptachloroaluminate electroplating \nbath it is possible to obtain, at room temperature, a homogeneous deposits of pure aluminium. \nIf the sample\u2019s surface is prepared in an atmosphere where the water and oxygen content are \nkept below 5 ppm, the coating adheres well to the substrate, without the use of additives. The \ndeposition rate achievable is about 10\u00b5m hour\n-1\n. The results presented in this paper show, for \nthe first time, the possibility of utilizing ionic liquids as electrochemical media to successfully \nobtain an effective corrosion resistant coating on lithium aluminium alloys, an extremely \ninteresting material that is now scarcely employed in industry due to its poor corrosion \nresistance. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 11 \nFinancial support from the European Community (Project FP6-(STREP) Contract \nNumber: 517002, IOLISURF) is gratefully acknowledged. \n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 12 \nReferences. \n \n[1] S.
