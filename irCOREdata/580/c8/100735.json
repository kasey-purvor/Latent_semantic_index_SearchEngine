INTRODUCTION\nNuclei in the vicinity of the doubly closed-shell nucleus\n50\n132Sn82 [1] give information on the basic single-particle\nstructure and interactions between pairs of nucleons occupy-\ning the valence states. In particular, the evolution of structure\nin the N=80 isotones can be used to identify the pertinent\nrole of the unnatural-parity h11\/2 neutron orbital which has a\nmajor influence on the makeup of the high-spin states in this\nregion. Isomeric Ip=10+ states have been reported in all the\neven-A N=80 isotones from 50\n130Sn up to 68\n148Er [2\u20137], with the\nexception of the Z=56 isotone, 136Ba. In the recent paper by\nGenevey et al. [3] the significant reduction of the BsE2d\nbetween the yrast 10+ isomeric state and the first 8+ state in\nthe Z\u00f858 N=80 isotones [4\u20137] compared to their Z\u014254\ncounterparts [2,3] has been discussed in terms of a signifi-\ncant component of the neutron snh11\/2d\u22122 configuration in the\nwave function of the 8+ state in the lighter systems.\nThe magnetic moment measurements of the yrast Ip\n=10+ isomers in 58\n138Ce and 60\n140Nd [5] are all consistent with\nnear-spherical, maximally aligned two-neutron-hole\nsnh11\/2d\u22122 configurations. Similarly, two-neutron-hole 10+\nstates have also been observed in the lighter barium isotopes\n56\n132Ba [8] and 56\n134Ba [9]. The differing structure of the 10+\nisomeric state with the structure of the 8+ state seems the\nreason for the sudden decrease in the BsE2:10+\u21928+d value\nfor Z.56.\nIn the present paper we report on the structure of the\nstable nucleus 56\n136Ba80 studied using deep-inelastic reactions\nand time-correlated g-ray spectroscopy. This completes the\nsystematics of the even-Z N=80 isotones, with the observa-\ntion of the \u201cmissing\u201d s10+d isomer in this nucleus, which has\na tentative snh11\/2d10+\n\u22122\nconfiguration.\nDuring the preparation of this manuscript, we became\naware of a parallel study of 56\n136Ba by Gan et al. [10], the\nresults of which are consistent with those presented in the\ncurrent work.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE\nPrior to this study the medium-to-high-spin data on 136Ba\nwere restricted due to the b-stable nature of 136Ba, which\nmakes it difficult to populate with heavy-ion induced fusion-\nevaporation reactions. The N=80 isotone lies between the\nlighter barium isotopes which can be readily populated using\nthis method [11] and heavier, neutron-rich isotopes which\nhave been studied as residues from spontaneous fission\n*Corresponding author.

To date, the data on the near-yrast states in 136Ba\ncome from work using b decay [15], sn ,gd reactions [16],\nCoulomb excitation [17], and light-ion s9Bed induced fusion\nreactions [18]. As a result, prior to this work, the highest spin\nstate known was the yrast 8+ state identified by Dragulescu et\nal. [18].\nThe current work utilized a thin-target heavy-ion binary\nreaction to populate the medium-spin yrast states in 136Ba.\nThe experiment reported in the current work was performed\nat Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory using an\n850 MeV 54136Xe beam provided by the 88 in. cyclotron inci-\ndent on a self-supporting 420 mg cm\u22122 78\n198Pt target, isotopi-\ncally enriched to .92%. The typical beam intensity was\n<1 pnA and the cyclotron beam had a natural micropulsing\nperiod of 178 ns. Reaction g rays were detected using the\nGAMMASPHERE g-ray array [19], which in this experi-\nment consisted of 103 Compton-suppressed germanium de-\ntectors, 70 of which are electrically segmented into two\nD-shaped halves to improve the Doppler correction. The\nheavy-metal collimators from the bismuth germanate (BGO)\nsuppression shields were removed thereby allowing a mea-\nsurement of g-ray fold to be taken for each event (see later).\nThe Chico gas-filled parallel plate avalanche chamber\nancillary detector [20] was used in combination with\nGAMMASPHERE to measure the angles (both polar and\nazimuthal) and the time-of-flight difference sDTOFd between\nthe detection of both recoils, thus allowing an event-by-event\nDoppler shift correction to be made for emitted g rays.\nThe experimental master trigger condition required two\nChico elements and at least three germanium detectors in\nmutual coincidence. The hardware master-gate timing condi-\ntion was set such that the third (and any subsequent) germa-\nnium signals in that event could be delayed by up to 670 ns\nwith respect to the detection of the binary reaction fragments\nand the first two g rays. Approximately 109 such events were\nrecorded on tape during the course of the four-day experi-\nment.\nIII. DATA REDUCTION AND OFF-LINE ANALYSIS\nThe beam-like and target-like fragments (BLFs and TLFs,\nrespectively) were detected using Chico in coincidence with\nthe g rays emitted by the reaction product nuclei. The DTOF\nmeasured between the detection of the two fragments, to-\ngether with the angular information given directly by the\nrecoil detector, allowed the separation of the TLFs and BLFs\n(as shown in Fig. 1). The most intense region for the frag-\nment distributions was observed at the grazing angle [21],\nwhich for this particular reaction occurred at approximately\nthe same laboratory angle of 50\u00b0 for both the TLFs and\nBLFs. Note that in the current work, there was also an ex-\nperimental detection cutoff for u,20\u00b0 as a result of a mask\nwhich was introduced to cut the high counting rate in Chico\nat very forward angles. The reduction in counts in the par-\nticle identification spectrum at 60\u00b0 occurs as a result of a\nsupport rib in the pressure window of Chico and was used as\nan internal calibration for the particle angular determination.\nIn the off-line analysis a software requirement was de-\nfined to include only events where at least three prompt g\nrays occurred within \u00b115 ns of the binary fragments being\ndetected in Chico. This allowed a well-defined time refer-\nence for all delayed g rays decaying from isomeric states in\nthe binary fragments to be used in the subsequent analysis.\nFigure 2(a) shows the sum of time distributions associated\nwith the individual GAMMASPHERE detectors and Fig.\nFIG. 1. Particle identification plot for the current work. The\nmeasurement of the DTOF and scattering angles of the recoils u\nallows the two binary partners to be cleanly separated.\nFIG. 2. Upper spectrum (a) shows the total time projection of\ng-ray events in the current work, note that the time between the\ncyclotron bursts is 178 ns.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 024316 (2004)\n024316-2\n2(b) shows the relative time differences between g rays mea-\nsured in coincident events. By setting software gates on these\nspectra, specific temporal regions could be defined, corre-\nsponding to either prompt g rays which were emitted from\nthe fragments in flight or those decays from isomeric states\nin nuclei which were stopped in Chico.\nThe recoiling products stopped in Chico, which was\n<13 cm from the target position, corresponding to fragment\ntimes of flight of <4\u201315 ns. Due to the absence of hevimet\ncollimators on GAMMASPHERE these stopped binary\nfragments were in the line of sight for the majority of\nGAMMASPHERE detectors, and thus decays from isomeric\nstates with lifetimes ranging from nanoseconds to microsec-\nonds were observed with an efficiency that was approxi-\nmately equal to that for g rays emitted at the target position\n[20].\nThe maximum velocities of the binary partners were b\n<11%, as determined from the two-body kinematics of the\nreaction. Therefore, the prompt g rays emitted in flight were\nheavily Doppler shifted. However, it was possible to correct\nthe prompt g-ray energies for the Doppler effect on an event-\nby-event basis using the interaction position of the recoils as\nmeasured by Chico. The interaction position determined the\nvelocities bBLF and bTLF of the recoiling beam and target\nnuclei, respectively. By conservation of linear momentum\n[20] and assuming the limiting case of no particle evapora-\ntion,\nPBLF,TLF =\nP0sinsuTLF,BLFd\nsinsuBLF + uTLFd\n, s1d\nwhere PBLF=ms136XedbBLFc and PTLF=ms198PtdbTLFc are the\nmomenta of the recoiling beam and target nuclei, respec-\ntively; uBLF and uTLF are the laboratory scattering angles\nof the recoiling beam and target nuclei, respectively, and\nP0 is the momentum of the incident beam. Note that since\nit is not possible to determine the mass of the recoils with\nChico, the momenta of the recoils are calculated assuming\nthe beam 136Xe and target 198Pt masses.\nThe Doppler-shifted g rays were corrected according to\n[22]\nES = E0\n\u02db1 \u2212 b2\n1 \u2212 b cos Q\n, s2d\nwhere E0 is the energy in the rest frame of the nucleus and Q\nis the emission angle relative to the trajectory of the nucleus\nin the laboratory frame. The angle Q was determined using\nthe expression\ncos Q = sin uRsin ugscos fR cos fg + sin fRsin fgd\n+ cos uR cos ug, s3d\nwhere uR and fR are the scattering angles of the recoils\nsBLFs and TLFsd, and ug and fg are the detection angles of\nthe g rays from GAMMASPHERE.\nThe g-ray energies as measured in the laboratory frame\ncould thus be Doppler corrected for either BLFs or TLFs.\nNote that in each case only the g rays emitted by the nuclei\nfor which the Doppler correction was made were enhanced\nin the resulting spectrum, while those with the incorrect\nDoppler correction were smeared out (see Fig. 3).\nFigure 3(a) shows the prompt g rays which were mea-\nsured to be within Dt= \u00b145 ns of the master trigger, with no\nDoppler correction applied. Figures 3(b) and 3(c) show the\nsame spectra Doppler corrected for BLFs and TLFs, respec-\ntively. Note that the BLF Doppler corrected spectrum [Fig.\n3(b)] shows the prompt 349 keV transition which feeds the\ns10+d isomer in 136Ba (see later), while in the TLF Doppler\ncorrected spectrum the 407 keV transition s2+\u21920+d in 198Pt\n[23] can be identified. The low-lying prompt transitions from\nthe 136Xe beam nucleus [e.g., Es2+\u21920+d=1313 keV] are not\nobviously evident in Fig. 3(b) due to the presence of a low-\nlying Ip=6+, t1\/2=3 ms isomeric state in this nucleus [24],\nwhich traps most of the prompt feeding.\nFigures 3(d) and 3(e) show delayed g rays gated in two\ndifferent time regimes. Figure 3(d) shows g rays emitted\nwithin the time range 200 ns\u2013780 ns, while Fig. 3(e) shows\ng rays within the first 200 ns of the detection of the binary\nfragments in Chico. The latter shows transitions associated\nwith the low-lying states of 136Ba [16] (see later), the 2+\n\u21920+ in 198Pt s407 keVd, and the delayed neutron peaks at\n596 keV and 691 keV coming from neutron excitations of\n74Ge and 72Ge, respectively. The two very intense peaks at\n110 keV and 197 keV are due to the g decay of the 52\n+\nstate\nFIG. 3. Upper spectrum (a) shows prompt g rays without any\nDoppler correction, spectra, (b) and (c) show the total projection of\nprompt Doppler corrected spectra for BLFs and TLFs, respectively.\nThe lower two panels show delayed spectra for two different time\nranges. Spectrum (d) shows delayed g rays emitted within the time\nrange 200\u2013780 ns, while spectrum (e) shows g rays emitted within\nthe first 200 ns following the detection of fragments in Chico. The\npeaks marked with a \u201c+\u201d symbol are g rays emitted during the\ndeexcitation decay of the s10+d isomer in 136Ba.\n136Ba STUDIED VIA DEEP-INELASTIC\u0085 PHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 024316 (2004)\n024316-3\nin 19F, with a half-life t1\/2=89.3 ns [23], which is used in the\nelectrical segmentation process of the HPGe detectors.\nThe full analysis of these data required a number of dif-\nferent coincidence matrices and cubes to be sorted.

Transitions below the \u008410+\u0085 isomer in 136Ba\nThe observation of the 819 keV s2+\u21920+d transition in\n136Ba in the delayed spectrum shown in Fig. 7 clearly dem-\nonstrates the presence of an isomer in this nucleus. Figure 7\nshows all the transitions up to the previously reported 8+\nstate, together with a transition at 363 keV, which we inter-\npret to be the direct decay from a s10+d isomer. The excita-\ntion energy of this isomer is established from the g-g coin-\ncidence relationships to be 3357 keV.\nSpins and parities have been established for the levels in\n136Ba up to the Ip=8+ state at 2994 keV [16,18]. The Ip\n=8+ [18] state at 2994 keV which decays to the Ip=6+ state\nvia a g ray of energy 787 keV is clearly observed in the\npresent work together with a previously unreported branch\nwhich decays to the Ip=7\u2212 isomeric state at 2031 keV [16]\nvia a 964 keV transition.\nThe multipolarity of the 363 keV transition could be\nE1,E2, or M1, from intensity balancing across the 2994 keV\nstate. Assignments of 8\u00b1 and 9\u2212 can be ruled out for the\n3357 keV level on the basis of nonobservation of direct de-\ncay branches to the 6+ state at 2207 keV and to the 7\u2212 iso-\nmeric state at 2031 keV. Spins of 11 and higher for the state\ncan be ruled out on the basis of the electron conversion as-\nsociated with such high-multipole decays and the measured\nintensity balance across the 2994 keV state. Of the remain-\ning spin\/parity assignments 9+ and 10+, the s10+d is strongly\nfavored on the basis of both the systematics of the even-Z\nN=80 isotones and the shell-model calculations (see later).\nA half-life of t1\/2=91\u00b12 ns, see Fig. 8, was obtained for\nthe decay of the s10+d state by measuring the time difference\nbetween prompt and delayed transitions feeding in and out of\nthe proposed s10+d state. Assuming an electric quadrupole\nnature for the 363 keV transition, the BsE2:10+\u21928+d\nfor 136Ba is calculated to be 0.97\u00b10.2 e2 fm4\n=0.0231\u00b10.0005 W.u.

Figure 10 shows a selection of\ncoincidence spectra for g rays above the isomer. The ener-\ngies and intensities of the prompt transitions observed above\nthe isomer are given in Table IV.\nThe prompt g-g coincidence spectra for states above the\ns10+d isomer show evidence for a cascade involving the 349,\n510, 849, and 328 keV transitions which are mutually coin-\ncident. The ordering of these transitions above the isomer is\nbased on the intensity measurements and the identification of\na side-feeding transition with an energy of 1164 keV which\nis in prompt coincidence with the 349 and 510 keV transi-\ntions and appears to bypass the higher-lying members of the\ncascade. The crossover branch associated with the 144 and\n1215 keV g rays appears to feed directly into the proposed\n3706 keV level which is depopulated by the 349 keV transi-\ntion. The ordering of the 144 keV and 1215 keV transitions\nis established in the current work on the basis of measured\ng-ray intensity.\nThe ordering of the structure built on top of the s10+d\nisomeric state as presented in the current work is tentative.\nSpecifically, the intense transition at 130 keV is in mutual\ncoincidence with the cascade of 349, 510, 849, and 328 keV\n(see Fig. 10), although it does not appear to be in coinci-\ndence with the 1164 keV transition which is assumed to feed\ninto the proposed level at 4216 keV. This situation suggests\nthat the 130 keV transition lies above the 849 and 1215 keV\ntransitions, but the large, measured g-ray intensity for the\n130 keV line (see Table IV) presents a potential problem.

We note that the 130 keV transition is in coincidence\nwith the unplaced lines at 208, 249, 264, and 130 keV, which\nmay account for some of this missing intensity. While the\nquality of the spectra used for the prompt g-g coincidences\nabove the s10+d isomer can demonstrate a number of mutual\ncoincidences (see Fig. 10), they are not of sufficient statisti-\ncal significance to preclude a different ordering of the lines\nabove the s10+d isomer. One alternative could be that the\n130 keV line lies lower in the cascade, i.e., either directly\nfeeding into the isomeric state or into the proposed level at\n5393 keV.\nV. DISCUSSION\nThe nucleus 56\n136Ba has six valence protons outside the\nclosed shell Z=50 and two-neutron holes with respect to the\nclosed shell N=82. It was pointed out in 1973 by Meyer-\nL\u00e9vy and Lopac [37] that many of the low-lying properties\nof the N=80 isotones might be explained by the simple cou-\npling of the two-neutron holes to a quadrupole vibrator core.\nThe authors of Ref. [37] also noted that the spectral pattern\nof the N=80 isotones from 52\n132Te up to 60\n140Nd were rather\nsimilar with the presence of a two-phonon quadrupole vibra-\ntional triplet established for 136Ba and its neighbor, 138Ce.\nThis work ignored any effects from the proton particles and\nallowed couplings of neutron-hole states from the\nd3\/2 ,s1\/2 ,h11\/2 ,d5\/2, and g7\/2 orbitals to a vibrational core.\nWhile this approach gave a reasonable prediction for the en-\nergies of the low-lying negative-parity states and the first 2+\nand 4+ levels, it predicted that the yrast 6+ and 8+ states lay\nabove the yrast 10+ level. This clearly pointed to the need to\ninclude both proton and neutron degrees of freedom in the\ncalculations for such apparently simple, two-neutron-hole\nsystems.\nA. Shell-model and pair-truncated shell-model calculations\nIn order to understand the structure of 136Ba, a shell-\nmodel approach such as the one described in Ref. [38] has\nbeen carried out in the present work. To truncate the model\nspace, the proton single-particle orbitals involved in the cal-\nculations are restricted to the three orbitals 0g7\/2 ,1d5\/2, and\n0h11\/2, which have initial single-particle energies of 0.0,\n0.963, and 2.760 MeV, respectively. The neutron single-hole\norbitals include all of the five orbitals between the N=50 and\n82 shell, i.e., the 1d3\/2 ,0h11\/2 ,2s1\/2 ,1d5\/2, and 0g7\/2 which\nhave single-hole energies of 0.0, 0.242, 0.332, 1.655, and\n2.434 MeV, respectively. Those single-hole energies are ex-\ntracted from experiment.\nThe effective shell-model Hamiltonian is written as\nH = Hn + Hp + Hnp, s4d\nwhere Hn, Hp, and Hnp represent the neutron-neutron inter-\naction, the proton-proton interaction, and the neutron-proton\ninteraction, respectively. The interaction among like nucle-\nons Ht st=n or pd consists of spherical single-particle ener-\ngies, a monopole-pairing interaction, a quadrupole-pairing\nsQPd interaction, a quadrupole-quadrupole sQQd interac-\ntion, a sHPd hexadecapole-pairing, and a sHHd\nhexadecapole-hexadecapole interaction. The strengths of\nthese interactions are determined so as to reproduce the\ncorresponding experimental energies of the singly closed-\nshell nuclei 56\n138Ba82 and 50\n130Sn80. A quadrupole-quadrupole\ninteraction is the only term in Hnp, the strength of which is\nadjusted to reproduce the excitation energy of the 10+ iso-\nmer. A detailed description of these interactions can be\nfound in Ref. f38g. The determined strengths of the inter-\nactions, in MeV, are G0n=0.145,G2n=0.016,kn\n=0.035,G4n=0.700,k4n=1.600,G0p=0.180,G2p=0.010,kp\n=0.055,G4p=0.600,k4p=0.300, and knp=\u22120.165. The defi-\nnitions of the HP and HH interactions are extensions of\nthe QP and the QQ interactions from angular momentum\ncoupling two to four, but no radial dependence is as-\nsumed. These hexadecapole interactions are necessary for\na better fit, since the number of valence protons and neu-\ntrons is small in 136Ba and quadrupole collectivity is still\nnot dominant compared to other interactions. In the cen-\ntral panel of Fig. 11 the results of the shell-model calcu-\nlations are shown compared with the experimental decay\nscheme for 136Ba as deduced in the current work. The\ncomparison for the even-spin yrast sequence up to the\nproposed s10+d isomer is rather impressive, with the cal-\nculations reproducing the ordering of these levels.\nTo study the basic structure of the levels in 136Ba and to\nkeep the basis to a reasonable truncation, the pair-truncated\nshell-model (PTSM) approach, which is described in Ref.\n[39], has also been used. This approach is very similar to the\ninteracting boson model in concept, but the bosons are now\nreplaced by correlated nucleon pairs to treat Pauli effects\nexplicitly. In addition to the S :J=0 pairs, the truncated va-\nlence space only allows pair excitations of the following\ntype, D :J=2,G :J=4 and H. Note that the calculation is lim-\nited to a single H pair that can only be formed by the cou-\npling of two h11\/2 proton particles or neutron holes to angular\nFIG. 11.

In contrast, the other pairs in\nthis model space are collective and can be made from linear\ncombinations of other angular momentum couplings between\npairs of nucleons in different single-particle orbitals. All\nthese pairs have positive parity so that only positive parity\nstates are predicted. In the right panel of Fig. 11 the results of\nthe PTSM are shown in comparison with the shell-model and\nexperimental results.\nFigure 12 shows the expectation number of pairs for the\nyrast positive-parity sequence in 136Ba from the PTSM cal-\nculations. From the upper two panels in Fig. 12, one can see\nthat the predicted wave functions of the positive-parity yrast\nstates up to spin 8+ are mostly dominated by proton D and G\npair couplings. On the contrary, as shown in the lowest panel\nof Fig. 12, the yrast 10+ state is dominated by a neutron H\npair, corresponding to the maximally coupled snh11\/2d\u22122 con-\nfiguration. The dramatic alteration in the number and char-\nacter of pairs between the 10+ isomeric state and the 8+ state\nis responsible for the isomeric nature of the 10+ state and\nalso for the large reduction of BsE2d transition rate (see be-\nlow). The shell-model calculations (see Fig. 11) predict that a\nsecond 82\n+ state lies just below the yrast s10+d isomer. This is\npredominantly the nonmaximally coupled snh11\/2d8+\n\u22122\nconfigu-\nration. As shown in Table V the wave function of the second\n82\n+ state is dominated by an Hn pair meanwhile the yrast 81\n+\nstate is dominated by Dp and Gp pairs.\nUsing the resultant shell-model wave functions, we can\npredict BsE2d values using effective charges with the con-\nventional relation en=\u2212de and ep=1+de as described in Ref.\n[40]. Note that the effective charge for the neutron is nega-\ntive since neutrons are treated as holes in this scheme. The d\nvalue is determined to give the experimental BsE2:21\n+\n\u219201+d value. The adopted effective charges are en=\u22120.82e\nand ep= +1.82e. The calculations predict a value for the de-\ncay from this isomer of BsE2:101\n+\u219281+d=0.04 e2 fm4 com-\npared to the experimentally deduced result of 0.97s2de2 fm4.\nTable VI lists the calculated and experimental BsE2d values\nfor the yrast sequence in 136Ba. Note that the theoretical stag-\ngering of BsE2d values is caused by the alternation of the\nnumber of proton D pairs and G pairs and the neutron H pair.\nThe shell-model calculations also predict the observed\nlow-lying negative-parity states with spin\/parity 5\u2212 and 7\u2212,\nand intriguingly also predict an 8\u2212 state at a similar energy.\nThere is no evidence for the 8\u2212 negative-parity yrast trap in\nthe current data. Such a state might however be very long\nlived, particularly if it lies below the well-known t1\/2\n=0.3 s Ip=7\u2212 isomer [23]. There is no evidence in the cur-\nrent work for the population of the second 2+ state at\n1551 keV corresponding to the n=2 phonon vibration [23].\nWith regard to the comparison between the calculations\nand the data for the states above the s10+d isomer, it is note-\nworthy that the yrast states which are predicted to lie above\nthe isomer all have negative parity and thus must be com-\nprised partly from a nh11\/2 component in their wave function.\nIndeed the calculations do not predict a positive-parity state\nof spin 11 or higher until <1.5 MeV above the isomeric\ns10+d state. However, the calculations predict a 10\u2212 state\nwhich lies a few hundred keV above the s10+d isomer and\nboth 11\u2212 and 12\u2212 states a few hundred keV above that.\nB.

In 138Ce\nand 140Nd [5] the magnetic dipole moment measurements\nyielding values of g=\u22120.176s10d and g=\u22120.192s12d, respec-\ntively, suggest that the configurations for these two 10+ iso-\nmers are consistent with the snh11\/2d10+\n\u22122\nconfiguration being\nthe major component. In 62142Sm and 64144Gd [6], two 10+ states\nhave been observed with the lower-lying one being isomeric.\nThis has been interpreted [6] as competing snh11\/2d\u22122 and\nsph11\/2d2 configurations. In 62\n142Sm, the (lower-lying) isomeric\n10+ state is mainly two-neutron holes in the h11\/2 shell,\nmeanwhile for 64\n144Gd the isomeric 10+ state is proposed to be\nmainly a two-proton configuration. For the heavier isotones\n66\n146Dy [7,43] and 68\n148Er [7,44], the 10+ isomeric states are both\nthought to have predominantly sph11\/2d10+\n2\nconfigurations,\nsince according to the systematics the snh11\/2d\u22122 states are\nexpected to be around 3.7 MeV and have not been reported\nin these nuclei to date [7].\nFigure 14(c) shows the systematics of the BsE2:10+\n\u21928+d for the even-Z N=80 isotones from 130Sn to 142Sm.\nThere is an obvious retardation in the decay from the iso-\nmeric 10+ state for 136Ba, 138Ce [4], and 142Sm [6] compared\nto the lighter isotones. Lach et al. [6] suggest that such large\nhindrances require a high configuration forbiddenness and\nsuggested a seniority four configuration for the yrast 8+ state\nin 142Sm.\nThe sudden decrease in the BsE2:10+\u21928+d value at\n136Ba as compared to the lighter N=80 isotones can be un-\nderstood qualitatively in terms of the likely components of\nthe wave functions of the yrast s10+d and 8+ states. As dis-\ncussed above, from g-factor measurements and energy sys-\ntematics, the nature of the yrast isomeric 10+ state is pre-\ndominantly of snh11\/2d\u22122 character in all the even-Z N=80\nisotones between 130Sn and 142Sm. For 130Sn, the closed-\nshell nature of the Z=50 core gives rise to a \u201ctextbook\u201d\ntwo-hole single-j shell multiplet, implying that the yrast 8+\nstate has a snh11\/2d\u22122 character. By a similar argument, the\nvalence two-proton system 52\n132Te can have only seniority two\ncouplings in the Z.50 valence space used. Neglecting exci-\ntations into the proton h11\/2 orbitals (which is reasonable\nsince these orbitals are at the top of the shell) the two valence\nprotons alone could only generate a maximum angular mo-\nmentum of 6+ from spg7\/2d2. Hence states of spin 8+ or more\nmust have seniority four, or incorporate the neutron pair with\nJ.0, since breaking the Z=50 core would be energetically\nless favorable. For Z.54, however, an angular momentum\nof 8 and above can also be generated solely in the proton\nspace. The development of an increasing proton component\nin the yrast 8+ state would then explain the observed de-\ncrease in the BsE2d from the predominantly two-neutron 10+\nstate.\nThe smoothly increasing excitation energy of the 10+ iso-\nmeric state [and by inference the snh11\/2d\u22122 configuration]\nappears as a standard feature of the N=80 isotones from tin\nto samarium. This can be understood from Fig. 14(a), which\nshows the excitation energy of the lowest-lying Ip= 112\n\u2212\nsingle-hole state in the odd-A N=81 isotones. The single-\nhole excitation energy of the h11\/2 neutron orbital is observed\nto increase with proton number. This increase in single-hole\nenergy is responsible for an increase of more than 1 MeV in\nthe excitation energy of the yrast 10+ state between 50\n130Sn and\n60\n140Nd [see Fig. 14(b)]. This increased excitation energy\nmeans that the seniority four configurations which include\nthe proton configurations can begin to compete energetically\nwith the seniority two snh11\/2d8+\n\u22122\nconfiguration in the N=80\nisotones at the barium isotone and for heavier elements. This\nresults in a reduction of the snh11\/2d\u22122 component in the wave\nfunction of the yrast 8+ states, which in turn gives rise to the\ndramatic reduction in BsE2:10+\u21928+d value at 136Ba.\nVI. DETERMINATION OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM\nTRANSFER VIA THE STUDY OF g-RAY FOLD\nThe knowledge of entry spin distributions and the related\nangular momentum population in deep-inelastic reactions\nhas a significant bearing on the potential for using such\nmechanisms in the study of high-spin states in neutron-rich\nnuclei. While some effort was made in this area in the 1970s\n(e.g., Ref. [45]), there have been only limited recent studies\nwhich utilize the power of large-scale g-ray arrays for chan-\nnel selection in attacking this problem (e.g., Ref. [46]). In its\nfull complement GAMMASPHERE has a total of 110 HPGe\ndetectors all of which are Compton suppressed, i.e., each is\nsurrounded by a high Z, high density oxide BGO shielding.\nThis shielding improves the peak-to-total ratio by reducing\nthe Compton background, but at the same time it can also be\nused to measure the g-ray fold for each event.\nThe total fold Ftot measured in each event was the result\nof adding the following contributions (see Fig. 15):\nFtot = FBGO + FHPGe + FCS, s5d\nwhere FBGO is the number of counts detected per event in all\nthe BGO shieldings, FHPGe is the number of g rays, not\nFIG. 13.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 024316 (2004)\n024316-10\nCompton suppressed, which were detected in all the germa-\nnium detectors, and FCS are the g rays that have been Comp-\nton suppressed, i.e., g rays that Compton scattered out of the\ngermanium and were detected in the HPGe detector in coin-\ncidence with its BGO shielding.\nAverage fold versus recoil scattering angle\nUsing semiclassical expressions, given in Ref. [47], an\nincident beam of 136Xe at 850 MeV gives an initial angular\nmomentum Lmax<300\". From the semiclassical sticking and\nrolling approximations [45,48,49] one can obtain an estimate\nof the angular momentum input to the fragments in a given\nbinary reaction. In the sticking limit [45] the predicted angu-\nlar momentum input to the fragments for the current work is\nJBLF<30\" and JTLF<60\", while for the rolling mode limit,\nJBLF<17\" and JTLF<45\". These numbers give an indication\nof the spin states that might be expected to be populated in\nthis reaction and can be compared with the average folds\nmeasured in the current work. To first order this should be\nrelated to the average number of g rays emitted by the sum\nof the binary partners in a given event.\nA gdelayed-uscatt-fold cube (see Table I) was used to obtain\nthe angular distribution of the average fold in the laboratory\nframe. Figure 16 shows such distributions gated on delayed\ng rays in 136Xe, 136Ba, 138Ba, and 125Sb. Figure 16 has some\ngeneral features. One of the most prominent is the dip in\naverage fold around the grazing angle s<50\u00b0d. Note that this\nreduction in average fold is more prominent in the case of\nthe beam 136Xe than for 136Ba or 138Ba and it is essentially\nnonexistent in the case of the 125Sb. A second feature is the\nroughly constant average fold over the angular range su\n=65\u00b0 \u201385\u00b0d, where the average fold is the highest. At more\nforward angles su=21\u00b0 \u201339\u00b0d the statistics are lower, but the\naverage fold is roughly constant in the case of 136Ba, 138Ba,\nand 125Sb, unlike in 136Xe where the fold at forward angle\ndecreases due to the influence of the lower multiplicity Cou-\nlomb scattering channel. The reason why the statistics are\nlower at smaller angles is related to the low energy of the\nrecoils scattered at those angles, lowering the efficiency of\nChico in this angular range.\nThe g-ray fold for an event gives a measure of the degree\nof inelasticity of the binary interaction. The greater the over-\nlap and degree of transfer between the two fragments, the\nmore angular momentum is transferred into the internal spins\nof the fragments [45]. The transfer of angular momentum in\nheavy-ion collisions such as those described in this paper can\nbe studied in terms of the average fold versus the measured\nscattering angle of the recoils.\nAt the grazing angle the target and beam nuclei are ex-\npected to have a highly peripheral contact and thus quasielas-\ntic events would be expected to dominate. Since such quasi-\nelastic reactions are expected to have a relatively small\ntransfer of angular momentum from the initial angular mo-\nmentum into internal spins [50] the average multiplicity is\nexpected to decrease in the vicinity of the grazing angle. This\nregime could be explained with the rolling mode. The trans-\nfer of angular momentum increases continuously with the\ndegree of inelasticity [48], when the nuclei touch each other\nmore solidly; if the contact time is long enough (i.e., deep-\ninelastic collisions), the sticking limit ought to be reached.\nFIG. 14. Upper panel (a) shows the energies of the Ip= 112\n\u2212\nsingle-hole states for the N=81 isotones, taken from Ref. [23]. Pan-\nels (b) and (c) show the excitation energy of the Ip=10+ isomer and\nthe BsE2:10+\u21928+d transitions rates for the N=80 isotones, respec-\ntively, taken from Refs. [3,4,6].\nFIG. 15.

While\nsome of this apparent increase simply reflects the response\nfunction of the GAMMASPHERE array, it is clear that sig-\nnificantly higher folds are populated in this mechanism,\nwhich bodes well for future high-spin studies using heavy-\nion binary collisions.\nVII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, evidence for an Ip= s10+d isomer has been\nreported for the first time in 136Ba at an excitation energy of\n3357 keV. It was produced in a binary reaction between a\n136Xe beam at 850 MeV impinging on a thin 198Pt target. The\nassigned configuration is the two-neutron-hole snh11\/2d10+\n\u22122\nar-\nrangement, in good agreement with the shell-model and pair-\ntruncated shell-model predictions and the systematics of the\nN=80 isotones. The increase in excitation energy of the 10+\nisomers and the decrease in the BsE2d values along the N\n=80 isotones can be understood qualitatively in terms of the\nsingle-particle excitation energy of the h11\/2 neutron orbital.\nThe identification of this s10+d isomeric state completes the\nsystematics for the N=80 isotones from the Z=50 closed-\nshell 50\n130Sn to past the proton midshell at 68\n148Er. Prompt de-\ncaying states above the isomer have also been identified. The\nhalf-lives of a number of isomers populated in the reaction\nhave been reported for the first time in\n131I , 133I , 184W, 191Os, 192Os, and 198Pt.\nThe momentum transfer in this reaction has been investi-\ngated in terms of the average fold versus the scattering angle\nof the recoils. It is crucial to study the average fold distribu-\nFIG. 16.
