This literature is, therefore, increas-\ningly shifting its focus towards understanding the mechanisms that promote financial\ndevelopment. Recent contributions suggest that political economy factors, such as\nthe role of industrial and financial incumbents, may hold the key to successful fi-\nnancial development. Rajan and Zingales (2003), for example, suggest that trade\nand financial openness, which curtail the power of incumbents and change their in-\ncentives, may be a useful mechanism of financial development. Acemoglu, Johnson\nand Robinson (2005a) sketch a dynamic political economy framework in which eco-\nnomic institutions that facilitate economic development are social decisions chosen\nfor their consequences by the interaction between powerful political and economic\nforces. These authors strongly emphasize the role of broad based property rights pro-\ntection for economic development in general and the development of financial markets\nin particular. Much of this literature utilizes a variety of stylised facts or historical\nexamples, mainly drawn from the colonial period, which are primarily aimed at ex-\nplaining the factors that explain institutional development in the \u2018colonies\u2019. With\none important exception (Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson 2005b) there has been\nlittle attempt to gain an understanding of the factors that explain successful financial\ndevelopment in the colonizing powers themselves.\nThis paper aims to contribute to the finance-growth literature by examining the\npolitical economy origins of some of the most successful financial markets in Europe\nand Asia, drawing on a variety of historical sources. Specifically, it provides historical\nevidence primarily from London, but also from Amsterdam and Hong Kong, that\n1See Levine (2003) and Demetriades and Andrianova (2004) for recent surveys of this literature.\n1\nhighlights the essential role played by the government sector in kick-starting financial\ndevelopment. While there are important differences between these examples, we show\nthat the emergence of financial systems did not occur through laissez-faire approaches\nand that secure property rights alone were not sufficient for financial development. In\nthe cases of London and Amsterdam governments created large trade monopolies\u2014\nthe English East India Company and its Dutch equivalent\u2014which became the leading\njoint-stock companies and were responsible for all the important financial innovations\nof the time, including the emergence of trade in shares. In the case of Hong Kong,\nwhere the financial development model was bank-based, large banking monopolies\nwith close links to the state were created (e.g. the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank-\ning Corporation). These were modelled on the Bank of England\u2014itself a banking\nmonopoly for fifty years with close links to government\u2014which also became a tem-\nplate for the development of many other banking systems around the world (Goodhart\n1988).\nWe argue that the three examples we provide in this paper are not special cases.\nThe role of government in the early stages of financial development has been widespread\nworld-wide, including the Italian city-states of Venice and Genoa, the United States,\nand, more recently, in the newly industrialized East Asian economies such as Japan,\nSouth Korea and Taiwan.\nThe idea that the government can play an important positive role in the financial\nsystem is of course not a new one, see for example Stiglitz (1993). What is new in\nour paper is that the emergence itself of successful financial systems owes a lot to the\ninvolvement of governments, an aspect that has been neglected by previous literature\non finance and growth. We find support for our view in the writings of classical\neconomists. Adam Smith has been widely quoted for emphasising the importance\nof protecting property rights. However, his other important point, often overlooked,\nwas that the security of property rights alone is not sufficient for economic develop-\nment. Instead he believed that there must be government involvement in business.\nHe pointed out that \u201cproperty and civil government very much depend on one an-\n2\nother...\u201d and \u201c...the preservation of property and the inequality of possession first\nformed it, and the state of property must always vary with the form of government...\u201d\n(Smith 1763). Specifically, Smith argued that the government should erect and main-\ntain certain public works and certain public institutions, \u201cwhich it can never be for\nthe interest of any individual, or small number of individuals to maintain because the\nprofit could never repay the expense to any individual or small number of individu-\nals...\u201d (Smith 1776, p. 688). Here, by \u2018public works\u2019 Smith refers to companies (or\nnew property rights) created by Royal (and later parliamentary) charter.\nThis paper is organised as follows. Section 2 documents the emergence of London\nas a financial market, highlighting the role of politics, institutions and finance, which\ninclude the rise of the trading and banking monopolies with close links to government.\nSections 3 and 4 analyse the cases of Amsterdam and Hong Kong, while Section 5\nhighlights other cases. Finally, Section 6 summarises and concludes.\n2 The Emergence of London as a Financial Market\nA variety of historical sources suggest that London\u2019s stock market emerged during\nthe latter part of the 17th century and continued to develop during the early part of\nthe 18th century. Drawing on these sources, this section documents (i) the emergence\nof trading in stocks; (ii) the institutional changes that, as has been previously ar-\ngued, facilitated the development of the stock market, (iii) the improvement in public\nfinances and its relationship to stock market development. In so doing, it identifies\nthe key players in the private and public sectors in this process, namely the leading\njoint stock companies, the monarch and parliament. This examination reveals the\nfollowing two inter-related political economy aspects, which played a critical role in\nthe emergence of London as a major financial market:\n\u2022 The monopoly rights granted by the public sector (initially by the monarch and\nsubsequently by parliament) to all the leading joint stock companies.\n3\n\u2022 The long-term loans provided by the leading joint stock companies to the public\nsector in exchange for their monopoly positions.\nAdditionally, our analysis also highlights the role of foreign trade in the process, in\nthe light of the fact that all but one of the leading joint stock companies in that\nperiod were involved in trade with different parts of the world.\n2.1 The Emergence of Trading in Stocks: 1661\u20131703\nEven though the London Stock Exchange was formally established in 1773, there\nis evidence of stock transfers taking place as early as 1661 while the publication of\nsecurity price movements began in 1681.2 Scott (1912)\u2014one of the most author-\nitative historical studies of the emergence of joint-stock companies in Britain and\nIreland\u2014provides, among other rich information, a useful list of tables described as\n\u201cStatistics of the Chief Joint-Stock Companies if England, Scotland and Ireland to\n1720\u201d. The data, which include capitalisation figures and other useful information\non each company show that by far the largest joint stock company throughout the\n17th century was the East India Company (EIC), founded in 1599 to carry out trade\nwith the East Indies and incorporated by Royal Charter in 1600. The second largest\njoint-stock company up to 1694 was the Royal African Company (RAC), founded\nin 1662 to carry out trade with Africa (Scott 1912, p. 325). Table 1 summarises\nthe available data for share transfers of these two companies alongside Hudson\u2019s Bay\nCompany, which was the third largest foreign trade company and is considered by\nhistorians as representative of smaller joint-stock companies at the time. In 1694, the\n2Neal (1990b) identifies Whiston\u2019s The Merchants Remembrancer of 4 July 1681 as the first\nprinted evidence which documents that stock exchanges were taking place. This particular pub-\nlication, which was a sheet listing current prices of goods on the London market, also included\ninformation on the prices of the shares of the East India Company (EIC) and the Royal African\nCompany (RAC) in the form of symbols that suggested that the price of the former was at its highest\never while that of the latter was at its lowest. The first listing of actual stock prices was in the 3\nJanuary 1682 issue of the same publication.\n4\nmarket valuation of these three companies was \u00a31,212,720 (EIC), \u00a3185,175 (RAC)\nand \u00a352,762 (Hudson\u2019s Bay).3 All three companies had monopoly rights granted to\nTable 1: Transfers of stock in the foreign trade joint-stock companies, 1661\u20131689\nYear East India Company Royal African Company Hudson\u2019s Bay Company\nAverage Total Average Total Average Total\nNumber of Value Number of Value Number of Value\nTransactions Transactions Transactions\n1661\u201363 44 18,900 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n1664\u201366 57 23,900 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n1667\u201369 71 32,100 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n1670\u201372 126 47,000 49 19,500 \u2013 \u2013\n1673\u201375 152 53,800 39 50,200 7 5,150\n1676\u201378 131 55,400 42 48,670 6 5,450\n1679\u201381 172 68,100 40 41,200 10 12,550\n1682\u201384 780 268,300 67 49,160 29 13,650\n1685\u201387 537 191,000 77 48,650 22 8,850\n1688\u201389 655 238,000 91 46,800 24 5,390\nSource: Carruthers (1996, Table 7.1, p. 167) and Carlos, Key and Dupree (1998, p. 326, p. 337)\nthem by the monarch in their charter. The EIC was granted monopoly rights over all\nEnglish trade to the east of the Cape of Good Hope. The RAC was given monopoly\nrights over all English trade from Sallee to the Cape of Good Hope. Hudson\u2019s Bay\nCompany, incorporated in 1670, had a monopoly over trade in the region watered by\nstreams flowing into Hudson Bay in Canada.\nThe stock exchange was highly localised, with the trades and the circulation of\ninformation about the current share prices and profitability prospects for joint stock\ncompanies taking place in the coffee houses of Exchange Alley. Table 1 shows that a\nmarket for EIC shares existed as early as 1661, while trade in the shares of the other\ntwo companies emerged in the 1670s, soon after their establishment.\n3Scott (1912, Vol. I, p. 325).\n5\nIn 1694 the Bank of England (BoE) was established by parliamentary statute\nwhich provided it with a monopoly right to issue paper money and to take deposits.\nWith an initial capital of \u00a31.2 million, BoE overtook RAC as the second largest joint-\nstock company. By the end of 1695 there were in excess of 140 joint stock companies\nwith a total market capitalisation of \u00a34.25 million.4 50.3% of stock market capitali-\nsation or \u00a32.14 million was accounted for by three foreign-trading companies (EIC,\nRAC and Hudson\u2019s Bay). The BoE\u2019s capitalisation was \u00a30.72 million or 16.9% of\ntotal market capitalisation. Thus, between them these four monopolists accounted\nfor more than two thirds of stock market capitalisation, while other chartered compa-\nnies (also monopolies in their spheres of activity) accounted for 10.0% of the market.\nMonopolies, therefore, accounted for more than three quarters of the capitalisation\nof the emerging stock market.\nBy 1703 total stock market capitalisation had reached \u00a38.5 million. By that\ntime the East India Company had been absorbed by the New East India Company\n(NEIC), which was initially set up to rival the old EIC.5 The combined stock of\nthe two companies accounted for 26.6% of total market capitalisation. The second\nand third largest joint stock companies were BoE, which accounted for 21.2% of the\nmarket, and RAC which accounted for 13%. Thus, even by 1703 the three largest\nmonopolies accounted for over 60% of stock market capitalisation.\nSmith (1929) quotes historical documents which provide evidence that a spe-\ncialised class of stock brokers was developing in the latter part of the 17th century;\n4See Scott (1912, Vol. I, p. 336). Although it is known that 150 joint-stock companies were\nin existence by the end of 1695, due to fragmentary information for some of these companies it is\npossible to estimate total market capitalisation for only 140 of these.\n5Even though The New East India Company was initially set up to compete with the \u2018old\u2019 East\nIndia Company, and succeeded in being granted monopoly rights over the trading route to India by\nparliament, the two companies traded in parallel for a short period and eventually merged in 1702.\nDuring their co-existence trade with India was managed by a joint committee, i.e. it appears that\nthey acted jointly as a monopolist (Scott 1912, Vol. III, p. 479).\n6\na regular tariff for dealing in securities seems to have existed certainly by 1694. The\nactivities of the brokers and the growth of speculation attracted the attention of the\ngovernment. In 1697 there was the first attempt to regulate the activities of stock\nbrokers through legislation that took the form of \u201cAn Act to restrain the numbers\nand ill-practices of stock-jobbers\u201d. The Act limited the number of brokers to 100\nand provided for licensing arrangements by the lord mayor of London. Thus, his-\ntorical sources confirm that organised, albeit unregulated, trading in stocks existed\nas early as 1661 and that by the end of the end of the 17th century trading became\nregulated. Moreover, it appears that monopoly was the modus operandi for all the\nleading joint-stock companies at the time.\n2.2 Politics, Institutions and Finance\nThe emergence and steady expansion of the stock market in the 1670s and 1680s\nin London, as discussed above, prompts the question: What were the factors that\nbrought about the market emergence? A well-established explanation of the develop-\nment of financial markets in England, due to North and Weingast (1989), highlights\nthe credibility of secure property rights, following the Glorious Revolution of 1688\nwhen constitutional changes substantially shifted the power in favour of parliament\nand away from the monarch.6 In England under the Stuarts, the monarch was ex-\npected to fund the government (\u201clive of his own\u201d) and had considerable discretionary\npower, largely unchecked by Parliament, to obtain funds for the Crown. As England\nwas embroiled in the wars of the late 16th (the war with Spain in 1588, with its last-\ning debt legacy well after Elisabeth\u2019s death) and the first half of the 17th centuries,\nthe legacy of financing the war effort left a chronic gap between the Crown\u2019s revenue\nand expenditure and was forcing the monarchy to search for ever-inventive ways of\n6For a detailed historical account of political and economic realities of the 17th century England\nsee Smith (1984) and Holmes (1993). A compact but highly informative account can also be found\nin Roseveare (1991).\n7\nobtaining revenue: the sale of Crown\u2019s lands, hereditary titles, and monopoly licenses,\nas well as forcing loans on favourable terms for the Crown which in many instances\nwere only partially repaid. These measures, coupled with the unique position of the\nmonarch as the ultimate enforcer of the law, created a permanent tension between\nthe Crown and wealth holders many of whom were members of Parliament.\nThe gradual erosion of the monarch\u2019s credibility to honour loan obligations through-\nout the first part of the 17th century reached its logical end in January 1672, when\nCharles II, unable to obtain further loans, had to resort to the temporary suspension\nof all loan repayments (known as the Stop of the Exchequer). The tension between\nthe Crown and the Parliament was eventually resolved in 1688 when the two main\nEnglish factions (Tories, the landed elite, and Whigs, the monied interests), who were\nalienated by the reigning King James II (the successor of Charles II), invited Mary\nand William of Orange to seize the throne in exchange for important constitutional\nconcessions. This event became known as the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and its\nrole in making England into the Great Power of the 18th century is well-documented\nby historians. The key of this momentous historical event was the monarchs\u2019 accep-\ntance to respect Parliament and Parliament\u2019s laws: constitutional constraints were\nsolidified in 1689 when the English Bill of Rights, the Toleration Act and the Mutiny\nAct were passed, while the fiscal constraints on the crown were firmly established by\n1697 with Parliament given the power to authorise taxation and audit revenues.\nThere is consensus in the literature (see North and Weingast (1989) and Dickson\n(1967), among others) that the Glorious Revolution led to a substantial improvement\nin public finances by removing the possibility of default by the monarch\/government\nwitnessed before 1688.7 Parliament gained the power to scrutinise all government\n7Note, however, that Roseveare (1991) strongly argues that the two decades before the Glorious\nRevolution constitutional, administrative and financial innovations paved the way for subsequent\ndevelopments in public finance and institutional changes of the 1690s: \u201cThe philosophy of account-\nability which was to shape post-Revolution financial control [on government spending] was clearly\narticulated in the reign of Charles II\u201d (p. 15, bottom).\n8\naccounts, which severely limited the ability of the monarch to over-spend. Moreover,\nincreased accountability resulted in certain taxes being earmarked for meeting public\ndebt obligations, which made the commitment to repay debt credible.\nIt has also been argued by North and Weingast (1989) that these institutional\nreforms were a legal milestone for the development of private capital markets, essen-\ntially by strengthening the security of property rights. However, this is a controversial\ninterpretation of these reforms. Undoubtedly, to the extent that the reforms follow-\ning 1688 enhanced the security of property rights, they must have also strengthened\ninvestors\u2019 confidence and (together with other characteristics of the early 18th cen-\ntury economic and political life in England) contributed to the growth of financial\nmarkets. However, the active exchange of company shares, documented in Section\n2.1, was taking place well before the Glorious Revolution. The increasing trend in\nthe transfers of company shares over 1660\u20131688 (see Table 1) suggests that investors\nfelt sufficiently secure to be willing to undertake the trades. Hence the emergence\nand expansion of the stock market in Exchange Alley in the 1670s and 1680s calls for\na different explanation.\nThe North and Weingast interpretation of the implications of 1688 for private\ncapital markets has also been questioned by economic historians, political scientists\nand sociologists. Stasavage (2002), for example, suggests that the multiple veto points\nintroduced by the reforms were neither necessary nor sufficient for the credibility of\ncommitment and that partisan politics played a much more important role. Critique\nby Carruthers (1996) emphasises the importance of the joint-stock companies for\npublic finance. Carlos et al. (1998) suggest that \u201c... it is necessary to question the\nimplicit, if not explicit, assumption that the London capital market emerged Phoenix-\nlike from the ashes of the old regime\u201d (p. 319). Their examination of the early market\nfor stock of the Royal African and Hudson\u2019s Bay companies highlights the importance\nof the micro-institutional structure of financial markets, including investor\u2019s learning\nabout financial risk and rewards, the gathering of information about companies, how\nto buy and sell securities, where to buy and sell etc. They conclude that even financial\n9\nregulation had its roots in investor\u2019s learning: \u201cthis learning must also have provided\nthe experience that allowed investors to deal with various financial crises in terms of\nregulation rather than market rejection\u201d (p. 343).\n2.3 The Improvement in Public Finances\nUp to 1688, crown borrowing was short-term and was mainly carried out through\ngoldsmith bankers.8 Government debt amounted to no more than \u00a31 million, which\nseverely constrained government spending.9 There was a chronic gap between govern-\nment revenues and government expenditure which hindered the ability of the monarch\nto sustain a strong army.10 As a result England was weak as a military power. From\nthe 1690s onwards the volume of government long-term borrowing expanded very\nsubstantially, resulting in government debt rising from \u00a31 million in 1688 to \u00a316.7\nmillion by 1697.11 Table 2, which portrays the sources of government long-term bor-\nrowing during 1693\u20131698, shows that this period witnessed a remarkable increase in\nthe ability of the government to raise long-term loans.\nInterestingly, the largest two loans raised by the government during this period\nwere from the New East India Company (NEIC) and the Bank of England, amounting\nto \u00a32.0 million and \u00a31.2 million, respectively. These loans were provided at the same\ntime the two companies were incorporated by parliamentary statute. This was not a\ncoincidence. In the case of the NEIC Scott (1912) states that \u201cThe original capital\nconsisted of 1,662,000 lent to the government, out of a total of 2,000,000, which\ncarried the monopoly of the trade to India\u201d (p. 479). There is, therefore, clear\nevidence that the loan to government was granted by the NEIC in a direct exchange\n8Forced loans from wealthy corporate bodies such as EIC or the Corporation the City of London\nwere also important sources of funds for the Crown (Roseveare 1991, p. 23).\n9North and Weingast (1989, Table 3, p. 822).\n10Carruthers (1996, Ch. 3).\n11North and Weingast (1989, Table 3, p. 822).\n10\nTable 2: Sources of government long-term borrowing, 1693\u20131698\nDate of Sum raised Interest, % Type of fund\nroyal assent\nto Loan Act\n26 Jan 1693 \u00a3108,100 10 until Tontine\nmid-1700,\nthen 7\n26 Jan 1693 \u00a3773,394 14 Single life annuities\n8 Feb 1693 \u00a3118,506 14 Single life annuities\n23 Mar 1694 \u00a31,000,000 14 Million Lottery\n24 Apr 1694 \u00a31,200,000 8 Bank of England\n24 Apr 1694 \u00a3300,000 10, 12, and 14 Annuities for 1, 2, and 3 lives\n16 Apr 1697 \u00a31,400,000\u2217 6.3 Malt Lottery\n5 Jul 1698 \u00a32,000,000 8 New East India Company\n* This was a lottery of 140,000 \u00a310 tickets; only 1,763 tickets were in fact sold.\nThe rest were used by the Exchequer as cash.\nSource: Dickson (1967, pp. 48\u20139)\nfor the monopoly rights over the trading route to India.\nIn a similar vein, the Bank of England provided the whole of its initial capital\nof \u00a31.2 million as a long-term loan to the government directly in exchange for its\nmonopoly license. Scott (1912) describes the bargaining between parliament, which\nwas trying to raise funds for the war with France (the war of Spanish succession),\nand the two major syndicates with different political affiliations that were bidding\nto secure the monopoly right of circulating paper money during 1692\u20131693. One of\nthese was led by Chamberlain, who was affiliated to the Tories (who then represented\nthe interests of landowners). The other syndicate, led by Paterson, who was affiliated\nto the Whigs (otherwise known as the \u2018moneyed men\u2019), was the one that succeeded\nthrough a revised proposal which provided a loan to the government of \u00a31.2 million\n11\nat 8%.12, 13 Historical sources therefore suggest that parliament actively encouraged\nbids for the granting of valuable monopoly \u2018licenses\u2019 to joint stock companies led by\nindividuals with political connections.\nThe loans provided by the NEIC and the Bank of England to the government\nwere perhaps the largest at the time but were by no means exceptional. They were\nvery much the normal way in which the business of public finance was conducted in\nthose days. Carruthers (1996, p. 76) aptly summarises the relationship between the\njoint stock companies and the government in the 1690s:\n\u201cJoint stock companies enjoyed special privileges and monopoly power\ngranted by the state and in exchange for this they customarily made a fi-\nnancial contribution. What distinguished this period from earlier ones was\nthe sheer volume of borrowing from companies, and the fact that company\nshares could be easily traded on the London stock market. In contrast with\nannuities and lottery loans [the other two prominent methods of government\nborrowing at the time], and unlike shares in earlier times, by the late sev-\nenteenth century company equity was easily transferable to third parties.\nThrough joint-stock companies, public finance became linked to private fi-\nnance and to the London stock market.\u201d\nIt can therefore be concluded that the emergence of London\u2019s stock market un-\ndoubtedly contributed to the improvement in public finances. It may also be argued\nthat granting monopoly licenses to the companies that provided loans to the govern-\nment made these companies more profitable, which in turn made it easier for them\nto raise capital. Thus, the development of the stock market went hand in hand with\nthe improvement in public finances.\n12The capital was raised through subscriptions that were limited to \u00a310,000 per person; the\nsubscription lists opened on 21 June 1694 offered a discount to early subscribers; the issue was sold\nby 2 July 1694.\n13Interestingly, this loan was never repaid (Carruthers 1996, p. 80).\n12\n2.4 Trade and Growth\nA variety of sources suggest that the period after 1660 was characterised by an expan-\nsion in trade and a rise in real incomes. Holmes (1993) describes the period between\nthe late 1660s and 1690 as the English \u2018Commercial Revolution\u2019, which was charac-\nterised by an acceleration of trends already in evidence before 1660. He ascribes the\nacceleration in trade in large part to government measures such as the new navigation\npolicy, legislation that was highly protective of English shipping.14 Contributing fac-\ntors were also the acquisition of the Carolinas and the further development of existing\ncolonies. An outstanding feature of the commercial revolution was the expansion of\ntrade beyond Europe, particularly \u2018the plantations\u2019 in North America and the West\nIndies in the west and India in the east, through the EIC trading posts. Holmes\n(1993) suggests that the total tonnage of English merchant shipping increased from\n162,000 tons in 1629 to 340,000 tones in 1686.15\nEstimates of trade statistics by Davis (1954) show that total exports increased\nfrom 4.1 million in 1663\u201369 to 6.4 million in 1699\u20131701, representing an increase of\nover 50%, while total imports increased from 4.4m to 5.8m during the same period.\n2.5 The Role of Monopolies\nThe large monopolies appear to have been efficient forms of organising overseas trade\n(in the case of EIC, RAC and Hudson\u2019s Bay) and banking activities (in the case\nof the BoE). The companies evidently enjoyed economies of both scale and scope.\nIn the case of the trading monopolies, there were operational economies of scale\nlargely due to security considerations which, among other things, dictated creating\n14The 1660 Act for encouraging and increasing of shipping and navigation was aimed at breaking\nDutch dominance and boosting the merchant fleet by introducing selective prohibitions or deterrents\nin using \u2018foreign\u2019 ships e.g. double custom duties on imports if not transported in English-owned or\nmanned ships, prohibition of using \u2018foreign\u2019 ships in all trade with the \u2018plantations\u2019.\n15See also Carruthers (1996, Ch. 5, fn. 1).\n13\nand maintaining a private army, a right stipulated in their charter of incorporation.16\nThe state was reluctant to offer protection to these companies in overseas territories\nbecause it wanted to avoid unnecessary wars.17\nThe trading technology itself exhibited economies of both scale and scope in that\nthere were large set up costs in establishing trading outposts along a particular trading\nroute, which however facilitated the expansion of trade into neighbouring regions.18\nIn addition, the large size of these monopolies, particularly the EIC, created financial\nefficiencies that were responsible for financial innovations that arguably were respon-\nsible for the emergence of the financial market. In the early years of the EIC (up\nto the 1650s), the company raised capital for each voyage, at the end of which the\ninvestment was liquidated and profits, if any, distributed to investors (Scott 1912,\nVol. II). Thus, investment was highly risky. From the 1660s, the company started is-\nsuing permanent capital, leading to the emergence and expansion of trade in shares.19\nThis innovation resulted in much lower risk for investors who benefited from the di-\nversification offered by multiple voyages, thereby providing an important stimulus for\nsavings mobilisation. The subsequent emergence of trading in stocks triggered an-\nother financial innovation which involved a simplified procedure for transferring the\n16Scott (1912, Vol. I, p. 179) documenting the public debate on monopolies in the late 1600s and\nearly 1700s notes that \u201cCompanies for foreign trade were generally admitted to require extensive\nimmunities, since they performed functions which the State was not able to undertake\u201d.\n17See Scott (1912, Vol. I, p. 253) for a discussion of the importance of foreign trade joint-stock\ncompanies being able to defend themselves: without a private army the company would need to call\nupon the state to defend the trading route against foreign competitors and pirates thus drawing the\ncountry into a war with another, without any other good reason for such war.\n18See, for example, Scott (1912, Vol. II, pp. 21\u201322) for an illustration of the costs involved in the\ncase of the Royal African Company.\n19Upon the renewal of the EIC\u2019s charter in 1657, a provision was made to issue capital which\nwere to be permanent for 7 years. At the end of this period, in October 1664, it was announced\nthat \u201cthe whole gain for the seven years may be taken at 90 per cent or an annual average of about\n13 per cent\u201d, which signified the fact that the transition from terminable to permanent capital was\ncomplete (Scott 1912, Vol. II, p. 129, 132).\n14\nownership of shares (ibid.).\nIt is hard to see how these critical financial innovations could have been delivered\nby smaller foreign trading companies, in competition with each other.20 It would have\nbeen too expensive for each of them to set up and maintain a private army. Without\nthis protection, the voyages of these companies would have been much riskier than the\nvoyages of the EIC. Thus, savings mobilisation by smaller companies would have been\nmuch more problematic. Raising permanent capital would have also been problematic\nwithout the diversification offered by a large number of voyages.\nThere were also economies of scale and scope in banking activities. Note issue\ntechnology exhibits economies of scale due to large fixed costs emanating from, for\nexample, the need to prevent forgery. Deposit taking typically facilitates making\nloans and vice versa. Providing banking services to the state may also involve such\neconomies. However, these economies quickly disappear when the market becomes\nsufficiently large. This suggests that the market for banking services may exhibit\nfeatures of a natural monopoly in the very early stages of banking development but\nmore than one bank may operate efficiently once the market reaches a certain size.\nThis may well explain why the BoE lost its monopoly status after fifty years of\noperation as a result of competitive pressures.\nEven though monopolies were efficient forms of organisation at the time, they\ndid not result in the creation of economic oligarchies because their ownership was\nbroad-based. This also meant that they could mobilise saving by raising capital from\na large number of investors. Table 3 shows the number of shareholders in the leading\njoint-stock companies during 1601\u20131720. The number of shareholders in the EIC grew\nfrom about 200 at its foundation to 1,200 by the end of the 17th century. The Bank\nof England had more than 1,200 shareholders when it was founded in 1694. Even the\nHudson\u2019s Bay Company, the capitalisation of which was less than 5% of the EIC, had\n20A case in point is the formation of the Dutch East India company through the amalgamation of\nseveral competing companies which resulted in the creation of a private army (see Section 3).\n15\nas many as 89 shareholders by 1720.\nTable 3: Number of shareholders in leading joint-stock companies\nYear EIC RAC HB BoE\n1601 198 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n1617\u20131628 954 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n1670 \u2013 \u2013 18 \u2013\n1672 \u2013 \u2013 32 \u2013\n1680 \u2013 186 \u2013 \u2013\n1681 530\u2013600 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n1688 320 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n1693 482 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n1694 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 1,267\n1698 1,200 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n1701 763 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n1702 759 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n1703 960 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n1707 916 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n1708 965 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n1720 \u2013 \u2013 89 \u2013\nSource: Scott (1912, Vol. III, pp. 464\u20137, 472\u20133, 476\u20137).\nThe granting of monopoly rights to joint-stock companies was not uncontroversial.\nNevertheless, it was felt that on balance these monopolies were beneficial forms of\norganisation. A prominent statesman of the time, Sir Robert Walpole (a Whig, First\nLord of the Treasury, and the leader of the Cabinet over 1730\u20131742), joining the\ndebate on the detriments of monopoly in usual economic activity, notably supported\nmonopoly in foreign trade and banking when he stated in 1737:\n16\n\u201c...though in most sorts of trade, an exclusive privilege may be of bad con-\nsequence, I am nevertheless of opinion, that with respect to the Banking\ntrade, and the trade to the East-Indies, neither the one nor the other can\nbe carried on with such success, or in such an extensive manner, by private\nadventurers, as by a public company with such an exclusive privilege as our\npresent companies have; and in this opinion I am supported by the exam-\nple of our neighbours the Dutch, who, I believe, understand trade as well\nas most of their neighbours.\u201d (Parl. Hist. x.54, II March 1737, cit. op.\nDickson (1967).)\n2.6 Summary\nThe emergence of London\u2019s stock market in the period 1661\u20131703 is clearly associ-\nated with the emergence and establishment of large trading companies which enjoyed\nmonopoly rights over their trading routes such as the EIC and RAC. The monopoly\nrights which these companies enjoyed contributed to their profitability, which made\ntheir shares highly liquid. These developments facilitated the mobilisation of savings\nand therefore contributed to the growth of stock market capitalisation while their\nsuccess inspired the establishment of new companies. It is therefore clear that the\ngranting of monopoly rights initially by the monarch and subsequently by parliament\nplayed a critical role in the emergence of the London stock market and its subsequent\ndevelopment.\nTrading in the stocks of these companies emerged well before 1688 suggesting\nthat private property rights were sufficiently secure before the Glorious Revolution.\nThe Glorious Revolution of 1688 was clearly a legal milestone for the improvement\nin public finances, which became evident after 1688. Lending to government became\nmore secure after 1688, which may have had an indirect influence on the development\nof the stock market. Specifically, the government was able to raise long term loans\nfrom joint stock companies in exchange for the granting (or renewing) of monopoly\nlicenses. Both the NEIC and the BoE loans were cases in point. To the extent that\n17\nthe monopoly licenses made these companies more profitable, it can also be argued\nthat the need to improve public finances contributed to the further development of\nthe stock market.\nThere is therefore little doubt that the emergence of London\u2019s financial market\nwas far from spontaneous, owing much to the interplay between politics and eco-\nnomics, which resulted in the formation of large trade monopolies with close links to\ngovernment. While various kings received \u201cforced\u201d loans and \u201cgift\u201d loans in return\nfor granting monopoly rights to EIC and RAC during the early part of the 17th cen-\ntury (Scott 1912, Vol. II), it appears that by the end of the same century its benefits\nfor public finances were well understood by parliament. What can also be concluded\nfrom our analysis is that the much discussed influence of the institutional reforms of\n1688 on the development of the stock market was, at best, an indirect one.\nThe same monopoly companies that accounted for the emergence of London as\na financial market can also be credited for the improvement in public finances, as\nwell as the expansion of trade. The rise in real incomes which followed the expansion\nof trade created additional wealth, setting in motion a virtuous finance-trade-growth\ncycle which transformed England from a weak state in the early part of the 17th\ncentury to Europe\u2019s foremost military power by the beginning of the 18th century.\n3 Amsterdam\nA pre-cursor of the London stock market, the Amsterdam stock exchange, from its\nestablishment dominated by trade in the shares of the Dutch East India Company, can\nbe seen as the end-product of a natural experiment progressing along quite dissimilar\nlines, when compared to London, yet producing a remarkably similar relationship\nbetween the state, the foreign trading monopoly and the emergence of the stock\nmarket.\nThe Dutch example differs from the English one in several important respects.\n18\nIn the historical period of interest, the Netherlands, or more precisely the United\nProvinces, represented the only federal state in Europe. The strength of Amster-\ndam in the late 1500s as a centre of commercial activity, the trading entrepo\u02c6t of\nEurope with its massive commodity warehouses, sophisticated credit techniques, and\nemergence of speculative financial activity, is well-documented (Barbour 1950, Israel\n1989, de Vries and van der Woude 1997). The Dutch actively began exploring the\ntrading route to the East Indies in the 1590s, successfully checking the Portuguese\nsupremacy and making this route consistently important for the United Provinces\nfrom then on (Israel 1989). Noteworthy, there was a number of Dutch enterprises\nestablished in the period of 1594\u20131599 for the sole purpose of trading with the East\nIndies: starting with the Compagnie van Verre at Amsterdam in 1594, and quickly\nfollowed by two more East India companies at Rotterdam in 1598, and a second\ncompany at Amsterdam in 1599. High profits of these early companies in 1598\u20139\nstimulated proliferation of new companies in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Zeeland, and\nthe North Quarter, based at Hoorn and Enkhuizen, and with investment being drawn\nfrom inland towns such as Delft and Dordrecht. The ensued competition between ri-\nval companies, however, was beginning to affect profits by 1601 so much so that the\nmerchants and burgomasters of the towns felt \u201cit was getting out of hand\u201d: in the\nsix years to 1601 the price of pepper paid by the Dutch merchants in Indonesia rose\nby 100 per cent, while at home the stock piles of pepper and fine spices led to the\ninevitable drop in the price charged to the consumer (Israel 1989). The merchants\ntherefore persuaded the head of the Dutch government (Johan van Oldenbarnevelt,\nAdvocate of the States of Holland) to consolidate the trade in one company. However,\ngiven the federal structure of the republic and the geographical spread of investment\ncapital, the intricate detail of the new organization took months of intense negotia-\ntion between Oldenbarnevelt and the directors of the independent companies. The\nUnited Dutch East India Company (Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie, or VOC) was\neventually issued its charter (octrooi) by the States General in early 1602 to enjoy\nmonopoly of all Dutch trade east of the Cape of Good Hope. Noteworthy, the charter\n19\nbestowed upon the VOC not just vast commercial privileges, but also extensive mil-\nitary and political powers (such as deploying armies and navies in Asia in the name\nof the States General and conducting diplomacy under the States General flag and\nseal).21 It is also important to note that the company was subject to supervision,\nand its charter to periodic renewal, by the States General.22 In fact, the amalga-\nmation of individual companies was as much an economic act as it was a political\nact, since the managerial group of the united company had close affiliation and unity\nof interests with the political authorities (Steensgaard 1982). The historical sources,\ntherefore, strongly suggest that \u201cthe VOC was the creation of the Dutch state, as\nmuch as of the merchants who had actually opened up the East India traffic\u201d (Israel\n1989, p. 72).23 The perception of the VOC as the extension of the state in the far-\nflung territories of Asia, in fact, led to some discontent among investors who felt that\n\u201cthe profit was being sacrificed to the political objectives of the Dutch state\u201d (Israel\n1989, p. 72), with substantial amounts of the company funds being spent on arms,\n21In 1751, a century and a half later, commenting on the might of the VOC at the zenith of\nits economic and political power, Malachy Postlethwayt asserted in the Universal Dictionary: \u201cone\nof the reasons why the Dutch East India company flourishes, and is become the richest and most\npowerful of all others we know of, is its being absolute, and invested with a kind of sovereignty and\ndominion, ...[it] makes peace and war at pleasure, and by its own authority; administers justice to\nall; ... settles colonies, builds fortifications, levies troops, maintains numerous armies and garrisons,\nfits out fleets, and coins money\u201d. Cit. op. Neal (1990a, p. 196).\n22Israel (1989, p. 71) documents that \u201cthe charter stressed that the VOC\u2019s purpose was not just\nto enable all subjects of \u2018these United Provinces\u2019 to invest in the East India traffic, but also to attack\nthe power, prestige, and revenues of Spain and Portugal in Asia\u201d.\n23A distinguished historian of the Dutch East India Company, Niels Steensgaard suggests that\n\u201cThe VOC integrated the functions of a sovereign power with the functions of a business partnership.\nPolitical decisions and business decisions were made within the same hierarchy of company managers\nand officials, and failure or success was always in the last instance measured in terms of profit.\nBy these means the company as a business venture was able to internalise protection costs, and\nprotection costs were added to overheads that might be calculated rationally\u201d (Steensgaard 1982,\np. 237).\n20\nmunitions, troops and fortifications.24 Still, as the arm of the state, the VOC proved\nastoundingly successful within a short space of time, achieving global supremacy in\nthe spice trade by 1605.\nImportantly for our argument, the emergence of the stock market in Amsterdam is\nfirmly linked to the establishment of the VOC. As de Vries and van der Woude (1997,\np. 385) suggest, in the early years of the VOC operations an important principle was\nestablished that the capital invested in the company would be permanent and any\ninvestor wishing to liquidate their interest in the VOC could sell their share to a\nbuyer on a stock exchange (Beurs), thus linking the birth of the Amsterdam stock\nmarket to trade in the VOC shares. By 1608, the method of selling and buying\nVOC stock, as well as forward share selling, was well established (Dehing and \u2019t Hart\n1997). Moreover, using company records, notarial deeds, government ordinances and\nthe business papers of an Amsterdam merchant, a recent article by Gelderblom and\nJonker (2004) reconstructs the finance of Dutch East India trade in 1595\u20131612, to\ndemonstrate that shortly after the VOC was chartered in 1602, a vigorous secondary\nmarket in VOC shares emerged in Amsterdam, complete with extensive speculative\nactivity and the first bear raid in 1609\u201310. Gelderblom and Jonker (2004, p. 654) also\nfind that the establishment of the VOC had a consequence of spreading the share-\nownership much wider than was previously observed. \u201cThe Amsterdam chamber [of\nthe VOC] had more than 1,100 initial subscribers on an estimated adult population of\nno more than 50,000 people. The huge profits of some Asian expeditions had created\na keen public interest, to the point of attracting even small savers investing up to 150\nguilders.\u201d\nIn conclusion, what this example illustrates is that the way the monopoly was\nobtained (be it by the Royal Charter granted by a monarch in England or the charter\ndrawn up following fierce negotiations between the merchants and political elite of\nthe independent federal states in the United Provinces) was not as important as the\n24A more detailed picture could be seen in Steensgaard (1982, p. 247).\n21\npurpose it was assigned by the state: to consolidate the trading profits which could\nthen be relied upon in the state of either peace or war, and which at any rate the\ngovernment could tap in for the purpose of state- and empire-building. The trading\nmonopoly in both London and Amsterdam was the vital ingredient in generating\nsubstantial resources for the government at the early stages of financial development.\nThe substantial resources were creating the virtuous cycle of growth and development:\ngreater resources allowed the monopoly to fortify its operations and reap greater\nprofits, which made the trading in company shares increasingly more desirable; the\nincreasing profitability of shares led to increased volume and innovation in share\ntrading and that fostered stock market emergence and expansion.\n4 Hong Kong\nThe financial development in Hong Kong in the 19th century, in contrast to that of\nEngland or the United Provinces of the 17th century, was bank-based, rather than\nstock-market-based. Nevertheless, a similar pattern of a monopoly actively supported\nby the government as the key ingredient of the emergence and expansion of finance is\nconfirmed by historical sources (King 1983, King 1987, Ji 2003). The monopoly that\nplayed a special role in the financial development of Hong Kong was the Hongkong and\nShanghai Banking Corporation, often referred to as the Hongkong Bank in historical\nsources, or, as we know it today, HSBC. At present, HSBC is the largest bank in\nHong Kong and the only bank established outside developed economies to become\none of the largest banks worldwide.25 Despite being a British overseas bank, HSBC\nhad been headquartered in Hong Kong (from its foundation until 1991), with 80 per\ncent of its earnings originating from outside Britain, and grew mainly in the Far East,\nnot Britain.\n25According to The Economist (6 July 2006), HSBC was the largest banking group in the world\nby tier-one capital as of end-2005.\n22\nTo place the foundation and operations of HSBC, or more appropriately, the\nHongkong Bank, in historical perspective, it must be noted that the Hong Kong is-\nland emerged in 1841 as a free trading post of great economic significance, lying on\nthe \u201ccross-roads\u201d of trading routes between Europe, China and Japan. Hong Kong\nbecame a British colony in 1842 under the Treaty of Nanking; it had no represen-\ntative government (with the colonial governance being enacted by the Hong Kong\nGovernor), neither did it have local currency. The Hongkong Bank was founded as\na British overseas bank in 1865, initially as a limited company, by representatives of\nthe major trading houses (hongs) on the China coast.26 The explicit objective of the\nfounders was to set up a \u2018local\u2019 bank\u2014local in a sense of an overseas regional bank,\nheadquartered locally\u2014that would cater for the needs of merchants involved in the\ngrowing trade between Europe and China. Thus, from its inception, the Hongkong\nBank had a clear link to overseas trade. The historical sources also clearly identify\nthe founding fathers\u2019 intent to achieve incorporation of the bank by a special dis-\npensation from the British Treasury27 which, once obtained in 1866, moulded the\nactivities of the Hongkong Bank in the tradition of a royally chartered bank.28 The\nimportant privilege granted to the Hongkong Bank at its (re)incorporation in 1866\nwas the right to issue banknotes in Hong Kong and in South East Asia, while the\nsignificance of the special dispensation was in the assurance it provided that the notes\n26In his authoritative four-volume history of HSBC, King (1987, Vol. I, p. 54) states that \u201cThe\nsuccess of the Hongkong Bank undoubtedly rested from the first on the broad international base of\nits directorate. This was a British bank in a British colony on whose founding committee eight of\nthe fourteen members were not from Britain.\u201d\n27The special dispensation is known as the \u2018special Hong Kong ordinance\u2019 and it was drawn up to\nbe consistent with the provisions of the Colonial Banking Regulations (King 1987, Vol. I, p. 110).\nThe ordinance was for the term of 21 years, renewable on expiry.\n28The alternative to the special ordinance at the time would have been to register the bank as a\nlimited company, which in fact is exactly the organisational form that the Hongkong Bank adopted in\nthe period 1865\u201366. However, the registration as limited company would have prevented the bank\nfrom enjoying important monopoly rights, discussed below, which were only attainable through\nincorporation by special ordinance.\n23\nwould be accepted by colonial government treasuries (e.g. in payment of government\ndues and taxes). The latter lent credibility of the note issue with the general public.\nIncorporation by the special ordinance, therefore, implied a kind of endorsement by\nthe British government of the Hongkong Bank and of its notes, and that came at the\nprice of the bank agreeing to provisions which ensured the public\u2019s ability to encash\nthe bank\u2019s banknotes.29\nIn the 1860s, the Hongkong Bank was one of only two private banks enjoying\nthe privilege of note issue in Hong Kong.30 However, an important monopoly right\ngranted to the Hongkong Bank in 1872 by the Hong Kong Governor, hotly and un-\nsuccessfully contested by its rivals, was issue of notes with denomination less than 5\ndollars. Following the fiscal difficulties of the Hong Kong Mint which closed down\n(was sold to the Japanese) in 1866 after having existed for barely two years, this\nmonopoly right was subsequently confirmed by the British Treasury, which at that\ntime saw itself as the guardian of financial stability throughout the British Empire.\nMoreover, the Hong Kong Governor found legal solutions for the Hongkong Bank\nto expand its operation (including that of note issue) beyond the colony into South\nChina, Singapore, Malaya and elsewhere, in effect permitting excessive profits to a\nprivately owned institution (King 1983, p. 153).\nAnother important privilege enjoyed under the special ordinance of the Hongkong\nBank was the ability of the bank to bid for government accounts. After a success-\nful bid for the British Government \u2018Treasury Chest\u2019 and for the principal account\nof the Hong Kong Government in the 1870s, the Hongkong Bank became, in effect,\n29The specific provisions under the special ordinance included the bank\u2019s shareholders bearing\ndouble liability (ie double of their capital invested in the bank) and shareholders\u2019 unlimited liability\nin relation to note issue. See King (1983, pp. 150\u20134) and King (1987, Vol. I) for further details.\n30The other private bank was the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China which was founded\nby Royal Charter in 1853 and allowed to issue banknotes in Hong Kong from 1862. Along with only\ntwo other private banks, HSBC has retained the privilege to issue banknotes to the present day, its\nbanknotes becoming legal tender in 1935.\n24\nthe banker to both the British Government and the local government. By 1895, the\nHongkong Bank had become the virtually permanent banker to the British Govern-\nment in China and was responsible for over 80 per cent of the local note issue (King\n1987, Vol. II). From then on, the Hongkong Bank was called upon to provide banking\nservices for the British armed forces and for the consular services. As experts and\ngovernment bankers, its officers were also called to give advice on important economic\nand political decisions pertaining to the British financial interests in the East. The\nHongkong Bank\u2019s direct involvement in assisting the British Government in political\nand economic negotiations with the Imperial Government of China was manifested\nin the bank\u2019s sponsorship of the founding of the British and Chinese Corporation, a\ncompany designed to bring together British China interests (King 1987).\nAlong with holding the British Government accounts, the Hongkong Bank suc-\nceeded in becoming the government\u2019s banker for the Chinese Imperial government\nor Qing government (before the 1911 revolution), dealing extensively in government\nloans for political indemnities, national railways and even military campaigns (Ji\n2003). In 1870 it provided a loan of 4 million silver taels at 14 per cent interest to\nthe Chinese government for its Northwest Campaigns. In the period between 1878\nand 1890, the Chinese Imperial government contracted 26 foreign loans, of which\n17 were provided by the Hongkong Bank.31 The bank\u2019s total loans over the period\nof 1874\u20131890 amounted to 28,970,000 tael, or over 70 per cent of all foreign loans\n(Ji 2003). These loans provide additional evidence for the statement found in King\n(1987, Vol. I, p. 17) that the Hongkong Bank \u201cregarded the Chinese authorities as a\nmajor constituent and was commercially interested in providing sound advice and in\nmaintaining, sometimes at considerable expense, the credit-worthiness of the Chinese\nGovernment\u201d [emphasis added].\nIt is, therefore, evident from the above, that during the first three decades of\nits operations, the Hongkong Bank evolved from having a status of \u2018local\u2019 bank to\n31These included three major loans of 1,604,276 pounds at 8 per cent interest in 1877, 1,949,500\ntael at 8 per cent interest in 1878 and 4,834,000 tael at 8 per cent interest in 1881 (Ji 2003).\n25\nbecome by the end of the 19th century the most important foreign financial institution\nin the East. It acted as the government\u2019s banker to both the British and Chinese\ngovernments. It became the leading bank throughout East Asia, enjoying the privilege\nof note issue in Hong Kong, China, Thailand, Singapore and elsewhere. For more\nthan half a century the financial markets of East Asia, including China, set their\ndaily foreign exchange rate based on exchange rates set by the HSBC. As outlined\nabove, from its very beginning the HSBC had the following features: (i) it enjoyed\nclose support by the Hong Kong and British governments for its monopoly power;\n(ii) this monopoly power provided the HSBC with a huge influence far beyond Hong\nKong; (iii) the bank was highly involved in financing international trade, particularly\nso when it was founded; (iv) the bank served for the British\/Hong Kong government\nas a quasi-central bank; it was the most important bank which issued loans to the\nBritish\/Hong Kong governments and the Chinese government. These features and\nthe record of the bank\u2019s enormous success throughout its history provide support for\nour argument that a monopoly actively backed by the government was also the key\ningredient of the emergence and expansion of banking in East Asia.\n5 Other examples\n5.1 Italian city-states\nThe successful examples of London and Amsterdam in Europe were pre-dated by those\nof the Italian cities during the Renaissance. Banking, trade and industry flourished\nduring those times and government played a central role in these developments. Genoa\nand Venice were very important in Mediterranean trade, with the latter becoming\nthe most prosperous; its merchants became the intermediaries between East and\nWest, receiving trading privileges from the Byzantine and German emperors, and\neven the Mohammedans (Gilbert 1998). Numerous other cities grew and flourished,\nmaking Italy the most highly urbanized region in Western Europe in the 14th century.\n26\nPolitical power within the Italian cities belonged to the possessors of urban wealth,\ni.e. the bankers, the merchants and the businessmen.\nFratianni and Spinelli (2005) argue that Genoa and Venice in the 15th and 16th\ncenturies had developed many of the features of the \u2018financial revolutions\u2019 that were to\nbe found much later on in the Netherlands, England and the United States. Specifi-\ncally, these features include (i) credibility of debtor\u2019s promises; (ii) the role of national\nbanks in facilitating the development of financial markets; (iii) the extent and depth of\nfinancial and monetary innovations. Fratiani and Spinelli show that both Genoa and\nVenice exhibited all three features, even though there were some important differences\nbetween the two.\nGenoa and Venice had in place different commitment mechanisms that enabled\nthem to issue long-term debt. Venice set aside specific tax revenues to service the\npublic debt; while early period loans to the state were compulsory and based on\nincome, they subsequently became voluntary. In Genoa, which was more politically\ndivided than Venice, the commitment mechanism passed through the national bank\n(the Casa di San Giorgio), which was a semi-public institution with control over the\ntax revenues. San Giorgio represented the interests of the states creditors, but at\nthe same time it was also concerned about the political and economic viability of the\ndebtor. Neither Venice nor Genoa defaulted on their debt, even though Venice often\ndelayed paying interest. Both Genoa and Venice\u2014Genoa more than Venice\u2014carried\na low cost of public debt. Investors believed in the state honouring its promises and\nwere willing to accept a lower return on invested funds.\nBoth Genoa and Venice had their own public banks. Venice had (i) the Banco di\nRialto, which was a pure payment bank\u2014the closest predecessor of the Wisselbank of\nAmsterdam\u2014and (ii) the Banco Giro, which was an issue bank and the fiscal agent\nof the Republic of Venice: it was the closest predecessor to the Bank of England\nand the First Bank of the United States.32 Genoa had the San Giorgio, which was a\n32The Wisselbank of Amsterdam was established in 1609 as a public deposit bank and economic\n27\npredecessor of the Bank of England.\nFinally, both Genoa and Venice, but especially the former were financial innova-\ntors. Genoas San Giorgio invented the debt-equity swap and both cities understood\nthe relationship between reputation and cost of debt. In Genoa there was an ac-\ntive money market in which merchants used declared but not matured interest on\ngovernment debt to settle due payments and to extend short-term credit.\n5.2 U.S. state banks\nEven in the United States the role of the government in the early stages of finan-\ncial development was an important one. Sylla, Legler and Wallis (1987) outline the\n\u2018intimate\u2019 relationships which existed between state banks and state governments,\nwhereby state-chartered banks became integral elements of public finances between\n1790 and 1860. In several instances, such banks were either wholly owned or operated\nby state governments, but even when this was not the case, states purchased bank\nshares either when a bank was launched or at a later stage. This was very much\na two-way relationship not unlike the relationships that were common during the\nemergence of London\u2019s financial system in that (state) governments, at the time of\ngranting or renewing charters, were obliging state-chartered banks to pay lump sum\nbonuses to them. Sylla et al. (1987) find that about one fifth of state revenues during\nthat period was derived from banks.33\nhistorians are in virtual agreement that it was patterned after the Venetian Banco della Piazza di\nRialto of 1587.\n33Rousseau and Sylla (2005) show that the same period in the US history of financial development\nwas characterized by finance-led growth, suggesting that these \u2018intimate\u2019 relationships between banks\nand state governments were conducive to economic growth.\n28\n5.3 Japan, Korea and Taiwan\nThe emergence of strong banking systems that supported the remarkable growth of\npost-war Japan and Taiwan and post-1960\u2019s South Korea is well documented in recent\nliterature. It is also widely recognised that the role of government in the early stages\nof the financial development of these countries was critical (see, for example, World\nBank (1993), Amsden (1989), Wade (1989) and Wade (1990)). The banking systems\nof these countries, which were tightly controlled by their respective governments for at\nleast two decades, if not more, are widely credited with transforming their respective\neconomies into the industrialised nations that they are today (Patrick and Park 1994).\nGovernment interventions took many forms, including partial or total ownership of\nmajor banks, extensive government involvement in credit allocation, interest rate\ncontrols etc.34\nWhat is perhaps less widely emphasised in the literature on East Asian financial\ndevelopment is the fact that certain forms of government interventions\u2014such as re-\nstrictions on entry\u2014amounted to restrictions on competition, which helped tightly\ncontrolled banks to remain profitable. This also enabled governments to use them as\ncheap sources of finance not so much for themselves but for their priority industrial\nsectors, which were central in their industrialisation strategies. Moreover, restrictions\non competition did not result in a reduced volume of loans because of the parallel\nexistence of interest rate controls, which effectively guaranteed gross profit margins\nfor banks (see Kitagawa and Kurosawa (1994)). In such a set-up banks could increase\nprofit by increasing volume, which encouraged financial development by enhancing\n34Teranishi (1994) outlines the emergence of the Japan\u2019s heavily regulated financial system during\nthe high growth period (1956\u201370) and analyses the ways in which it contributed to economic growth,\nfocusing on the realization of dynamic scale economies. Park and Kim (1994) document the extensive\ncontrols of the Korean government over commercial banks, which for many years included the\ndetermination of deposit and lending rates at practically all financial institutions (p. 191). Shea\n(1994) outlines the emergence of the Taiwanese system, which has been dominated by government\nowned and managed banks.\n29\ncompetition among existing banks.35\n5.4 Counter-examples\nIt may be argued that by focusing our analysis on Europe and Asia, which con-\ntained predominantly successful cases of financial development through government\ninvolvement, we are biasing our conclusions. This may be because in other parts\nof the world government involvement in the financial system has been detrimental\nto financial development. Such counter-examples may be found in Central and Latin\nAmerica, as well as in Sub-Saharan Africa, where financial development has stagnated\nnotwithstanding (or perhaps because of) government involvement. One potentially\ngood counter-example is that of Mexico, where throughout the 19th and 20th century,\nthere has been little banking system development, especially if this is measured by\nthe ratio of private credit to GDP. However, careful examination of the conditions in\nthe Mexican financial system suggests that it is not a valid counter-example to our\nargument. This is because, in accordance to some of the most authoritative analyses,\nMexico has been a classic case of weak property rights (e.g. Haber, Razo and Maurer\n(2003, Ch. 4)).36 Our argument does not apply to cases with weak property rights.\nWe see adequate property rights protection as a necessary condition for financial de-\nvelopment to occur (through privately owned banks or markets)37 but not a sufficient\n35See Demetriades and Luintel (2001) for evidence of the positive role played by government-\nimposed financial restraints on the development of the South Korean banking system. Their theo-\nretical analysis of a cartelised banking system explains how a positive association between financial\ndevelopment, the degree of state control over the banking system and mild repression of lending\nrates can arise.\n36In Mexico banking development was stifled because a succession of authoritarian governments\nwith a tendency to expropriate, frequently in subtle ways, offered privileges to the banking elite,\nsuch as limiting entry, to ensure their continued cooperation (Haber forthcoming).\n37Without secure property rights, private banking may fail to take off, especially if prudential\nregulation is weak because depositors may not trust banks, where opportunistic behaviour is not\ncontained. In these circumstances, governments can still play a role in kick-starting financial devel-\n30\none. Our argument is that once sufficiently secure property rights are in place, the\ngovernment can play an important role in kick-starting financial development through\ncareful interventions.\n6 Conclusions\nThis paper provides evidence from historical sources which suggests that the emer-\ngence of London and Amsterdam\u2019s financial markets can be ascribed to the rise of\nlarge trading monopolies with close links to government. These monopolies were\nresponsible for the main financial innovations that gave rise to the emergence of trad-\ning in shares. We argue that London and Amsterdam were not special cases in the\nsense that government has played a critical role in the emergence of financial systems\nworldwide.\nAn important feature of the trading monopolies in London and Amsterdam was\ntheir broad based ownership which enabled them to mobilise saving from a wide class\nof investors. The monopoly position seems to have been critical in enabling them\nto issue securities with attractive risk-return characteristics, which, as a result, were\neasily tradable, giving rise to a secondary market. In this context, the establishment\nof banking monopolies with close links to government seems to have been a natural\nconsequence and it is the prevalence of such monopolies that facilitated the emergence\nof banking systems worldwide.\nThe evidence presented here also suggests that the London market emerged well\nbefore the strengthening of private property rights that followed the Glorious Revo-\nlution of 1688 in England. While this finding does not suggest that property rights\nare not necessary for the emergence of financial market\u2014they may have been secure\nbefore 1688\u2014it does suggest that ascribing the emergence of the London stock market\nopment through government owned banks (Andrianova, Demetriades and Shortland 2008).\n31\nto the reforms of 1688 is incorrect.38\nCould the models of Amsterdam and London be mimicked by countries that re-\nmain financially underdeveloped today? The VOC and East India models suggest that\ncareful exploitation of a valuable natural resource\u2014trading routes in those cases\u2014\nmay help to mobilise saving and improve public finances, both of which may be\ncritical to kick start financial development. Whether this avenue is open to low in-\ncome economies in a modern context is an important question for policy makers which\nwarrants further investigation, both theoretically and empirically. A tentative pre-\ndiction of our analysis is that countries endowed with valuable tradable resources,\nsuch as oil or gas, which also have sufficiently secure private property rights may be\nable to kick start their financial systems through careful government intervention.\nSpecifically, inviting bids for monopoly licenses for the exploitation of such resources\nfrom domestic investors could deliver benefits for both the government and domestic\nprivate sectors, as long as ownership of such monopolies is broad based. This is an\nimportant caveat. If this vital ingredient of the London and Amsterdam models is\nneglected, the formation of such monopolies would not only fail to mobilise saving\nbut it could also result in the creation of new economic oligarchies that are likely to\nstifle financial development for a long time.\nAs a final remark, the analysis of the emergence of financial markets in London\nand Amsterdam and the emergence of banking in Hong Kong, can also be related\nto recent work by North, Wallis and Weingast (2006) [henceforth, NWW]. The key\nconcepts in NWW are the \u2018natural state\u2019 and the \u2018open access state\u2019. The natural\nstate is characterised by limited access in the sense that it provides order by \u201cusing\nthe political system to limit economic entry to create rents, and then using the rents\nto stabilize the political system and limit violence\u201d. The most important mechanism\nof a limited access order is to contain violence and to provide social stability and\n38Haber et al. (2003) argue that selective enforcement of property rights by the government can\nserve as a substitute for uniform property rights enforcement (provided by the government as a\npublic good) and could deliver economic growth even in the presence of political instability.\n32\norder. Such system, however, fails to achieve sustained economic growth: according to\nNWW, most contemporary countries, including all developing countries, are natural\nstates. In contrast, an open access state, as the name suggests, is characterised by\n\u201copen access and entry into economic and political organizations\u201d. Social order in\nsuch society is sustained by competition rather than rent-creation. Moreover, an open\naccess state is able to achieve sustained rates of economic growth and development.\nAccording to NWW, only about two dozens contemporary countries, such as the US,\nthe major EU countries, and Japan etc., are open access societies.\nRe-interpreting our work within the NWW framework, our treatment of the po-\nlitical economy of initial financial development in pre-industrial revolution era can\nbe regarded as a successful development being achieved in a \u2018natural state\u2019, which\nlays the foundations for later transformation of the natural state into an open ac-\ncess society. We show that historically successful initial financial development in the\ncase of London, Amsterdam and Hong Kong started with political protection and\nmonopoly (or oligopoly), and that part of the reason for political protection was to\nlimit competition in order to create rents. In these examples, rent-creation by means\nof political power has played an important positive role in trade and financial de-\nvelopment. Essentially, as we argued above, without this protection or limitation to\naccess, large scale trading and large scale financial development, which provided a\nbase for later industrial revolution, may have never happened. We conjecture that\nonly when financial development has passed a certain threshold does it become ben-\neficial to lower entry barriers to allow for more competition, i.e. open access. Our\nanalysis therefore suggests that certain types of \u2018natural states\u2019 may be useful at ear-\nlier stages of development since they provide necessary conditions for achieving open\naccess society later. To this extent, our discussion sheds lights on conditions of initial\nfinancial development which determines later transformation from the natural state\nto the open access society. Without this initial financial development, countries even\nwith plenty of wealth and advanced technology (technologies comparable to those\ndeveloped during the industrial revolution), e.g. a country such as China in the 1200s\n33\nor in the 1500s and the 1600s, were not able to further develop and were not able to\ntransform from natural state to open access society.\nReferences\nAcemoglu, Daron, Simon Johnson, and James A.
