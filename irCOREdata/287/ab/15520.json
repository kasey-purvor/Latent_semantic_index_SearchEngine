INTRODUCTION\nQuantum accelerator modes are characterized by the effi-\ncient transfer of large momenta to laser-cooled atoms by re-\npeated application of a spatially periodic potential \u00031\u20133\u0004.\nQuantum accelerator modes therefore constitute a potentially\nversatile technique for manipulating the momentum distribu-\ntion of cold and ultracold atoms. Following the observation\nof quantum accelerator modes \u00031\u0004 there has been substantial\nprogress in developing a theoretical understanding of the\nmechanisms and structure that underpin them \u00034,5\u0004. This has\npermitted the observation and categorization of higher-order\nquantum accelerator modes \u00036\u0004, demonstration that the mo-\nmentum is transferred coherently \u00037\u0004, observation of the sen-\nsitivity of the dynamics to a control parameter \u00038\u0004, and char-\nacterization of the mode structure in terms of number theory\n\u00039\u0004.\nQuantum random walks have received attention due to\ntheir markedly nonclassical dynamics and their potential ap-\nplication as search algorithms in practical realizations of\nquantum information processors \u000310,11\u0004. In this paper, we\nreport an investigation into the use of high-order quantum\naccelerator modes to implement a quantum random walk in\nthe momentum space distribution of cold atoms \u000312\u0004. This\nmethod is more robust and easier compared with other recent\nproposals for implementing quantum random walks using\nion traps \u000313\u0004, microwave or optical cavities \u000314\u0004, and optical\nlattices \u000315\u0004, and should make feasible quantum random\nwalks of a few hundred steps. This would be a useful experi-\nmental tool for information processing.\nIn this paper we first survey the experimental phenom-\nenology and theoretical understanding of quantum accelera-\ntor modes. We then discuss how the generation of specific\nquantum accelerator modes can be experimentally con-\ntrolled. Based on these techniques, we explain how internal-\nstate-dependent momentum transfer can be achieved, which\nwill permit coherent beam splitting. Finally, we show how\nthis could be applied to realize experimentally a biased quan-\ntum random walk procedure.\nII. OVERVIEW OF QUANTUM ACCELERATOR MODES\nA. Observation of atomic quantum accelerator modes\nQuantum accelerator modes are observed in the \u0001-kicked\naccelerator system \u00033\u0004. In the atom optical realization of this\nsystem, a pulsed, vertical standing wave of laser light is ap-\nplied to a cloud of laser-cooled atoms \u00031\u20138\u0004. The correspond-\ning Hamiltonian can be written\nH\u02c6 =\np\u02c62\n2m\n+ mgz\u02c6 \u2212 \u0002\u0003d\u00031 + cos\u0001Gz\u02c6\u0002\u0004\u0005\nn\n\u0001\u0001t \u2212 nT\u0002 , \u00011\u0002\nwhere z\u02c6 is the vertical position, p\u02c6 is the momentum, m is the\natomic mass, g is the gravitational acceleration, t the time, T\nthe kicking pulse period, G=2\u0004 \/\u0005spat, where \u0005spat is the spa-\ntial period of the potential applied to the atoms, and \u0003d quan-\ntifies the kicking strength of laser pulses, i.e., the laser inten-\nsity. This Hamiltonian is identical to that of the \u0001-kicked\nrotor, as studied experimentally by the groups in Austin \u000316\u0004,\nAuckland \u000317\u0004, Lille \u000318\u0004, Otago \u000319\u0004, London \u000320\u0004, and\nGaithersburg \u000321\u0004, apart from the addition of the linear gravi-\ntational potential mgz\u02c6; this linear potential is critical to the\ngeneration of the quantum accelerator modes.\nIn the experiments performed to date to observe quantum\naccelerator modes, cesium atoms are trapped and cooled in a\nmagneto-optic trap to a temperature of 5 \u0006K. They are then\nreleased from the trap and, while they fall, a series of stand-\ning wave pulses is applied to them. Following the pulse se-\nquence, the momentum distribution of the atoms is measured\nby a time of flight method, in which the absorption of the\natoms from a sheet of on-resonant light through which they\nfall is measured. The quantum accelerator modes are charac-\n*Present address: Department of War Studies, King\u2019s College,\nLondon, Strand, London WC2R 2LS.\nPHYSICAL REVIEW A 73, 013401 \u00012006\u0002\n1050-2947\/2006\/73\u00011\u0002\/013401\u00018\u0002\/$23.00 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society013401-1\nterized by the efficient transfer of momentum, linear with\npulse number, to a significant fraction \u0001\u000620% \u0002 of the atomic\nensemble.\nThe spatially periodic potential experienced by the atoms\nin the far off-resonant standing light wave is due to the ac\nStark shift. We can therefore write \u0003d=\u0007R\n2 tp \/8\u0001L \u00032\u0004, where\n\u0007R is the Rabi frequency at the intensity maxima of the\nstanding wave, tp is the pulse duration and \u0001L is the red\ndetuning of the laser frequency from the 62S1\/2\u219262P1\/2,\n\u0001\u0007F=4\b\u2192 \u0007F\u0001=3\b\u0002 D1 transition of cesium. In these experi-\nments, the standing wave light is produced by a Ti:Sapphire\nlaser; the maximum intensity of the laser beam is \u00061\n\b104 mW cm\u22122. Within the regime where spontaneous\nemission can be ignored \u00032\u0004, the detuning can be modified\nover a range of order 30 GHz, so that the kicking strength\ncan be changed by roughly an order of magnitude. If \u0001L\n=2\u0004\b30 s\u22121, \u0003d\t0.8\u0004.\nQuantum accelerator modes may be observed in \u0001-kicked\naccelerator dynamics when T is close to values at which\nlow-order quantum resonances occur in the quantum\n\u0001-kicked rotor, i.e., integer multiples of the half-Talbot time\nT1\/2=2\u0004m \/\u0002G2 \u0001so named because of a similarity of this\nquantum resonance phenomenon to the Talbot effect in clas-\nsical optics\u0002. In the case of the Oxford experiment, T1\/2\n=66.7 \u0006s \u000322\u0004.\nB. \u0001-classical theory and high-order modes\nIn 2002 Fishman, Guarneri, and Rebuzzini \u0001FGR\u0002 \u00034\u0004\nused an innovative analysis, termed the \t-classical expan-\nsion, to explain the occurrence and characteristics of the ob-\nserved quantum accelerator modes. This theoretical frame-\nwork predicted the existence of higher-order modes, which\nwas subsequently verified experimentally \u00036\u0004. Our later dis-\ncussion focuses on these higher-order modes, so we briefly\nsummarize the \t-classical theory here.\nIn the \u0001-kicked rotor, the spatial periodicity of the kicking\npotential means that momentum is imparted in integer mul-\ntiples of \u0002G. This spatial periodicity also means that the\ndynamics of any initial atomic momentum state are equiva-\nlent to those of a state in the first Brillouin zone 0\np\n\u000b\u0002G, i.e., the momentum modulo \u0002G. This is the quasimo-\nmentum, and hence it is a conserved quantity in the kicking\nprocess \u000323\u0004.\nThe presence of gravitational acceleration in the \u0001-kicked\naccelerator breaks this periodic translational symmetry.\nTransforming to a freely falling frame removes the mgz\u02c6 term\nfrom the Hamiltonian; consequently quasimomentum conser-\nvation is observed, in the freely falling frame. Conservation\nof quasimomentum means that different quasimomentum\nsubspaces evolve independently. The FGR theory makes use\nof this property to decompose the system into an assembly of\n\u201c\f rotors\u201d \u00034,5\u0004, where the quasimomentum=\f\u0002G and \f\n\u0001 \u00030,1\u0002.\nThe linear potential due to gravity makes its presence felt\nby changing, relative to the case of the \u0001-kicked rotor, the\nphase accumulated over the free evolution between kicks.\nThis means that quantum resonance phenomena different\nfrom those observed in the \u0001-kicked rotor occur. For values\nof T close to \u0001T1\/2, where \u0001\u0001Z, certain states permit rephas-\ning, and hence, within any given quasimomentum subspace,\nthe projection of the initial condition onto states which are\nappropriately localized within \u0001periodic\u0002 position and mo-\nmentum space are coherently accelerated away from the\nbackground atomic cloud. The momentum of the accelerated\npopulation increases linearly with the number of kicks, and it\nis this which constitutes a quantum accelerator mode.\nThe closeness of the kicking period T to integer multiples\nof the half-Talbot time T1\/2 is formalized in the FGR theory\nby the smallness parameter \t=2\u0004\u0001T \/T1\/2\u2212\u0001\u0002. In the limit of\n\t\u21920 it is possible to simplify the dynamics of the operator-\nvalued observables to a set of effective classical \u0001or\npseudoclassical\u0002 mapping equations, separate but identical\nfor each independently evolving quasimomentum subspace,\nor \f rotor. If we define the parameters K=\u0003d\u0007\t\u0007 and \u0007\n=gGT2 \/2\u0004, these mapping equations can be written\nJn+1 = Jn \u2212 sgn\u0001\t\u00022\u0004\u0007 \u2212 K sin \rn, \u00012a\u0002\n\rn+1 = \rn + sgn\u0001\t\u0002Jn+1 mod\u00012\u0004\u0002 , \u00012b\u0002\nwhere Jn and \rn are the transformed momentum and position\nvariables, respectively, just before the nth kick. A quantum\naccelerator mode corresponds to a stable island system, cen-\ntered on a periodic orbit, in the stroboscopic phase space\ngenerated by the mapping of Eq. \u00012\u0002. As the dynamics of\ninterest take place within stable islands and are therefore\napproximately harmonic, the usefulness of this pseudoclassi-\ncal picture actually extends over a broader range of \t than\nmight otherwise be expected \u00035\u0004.\nA given island system is specified by the pair of numbers\np, the order of the fixed point, and j, the jumping index, and\nthe quantum accelerator mode can be likewise classified.\nPhysically, p is the number of pulse periods a \u201cparticle\u201d ini-\ntially on a periodic orbit takes before cycling back to the\ninitial point in the reduced phase-space cell, while j is the\nnumber of unit cells of extended phase space traversed by\nthis particle in the momentum direction per cycle, i.e., Jnp\n=J0+2\u0004nj. Transforming back to the conventional linear\nmomentum in the accelerating frame, after N kicks, the mo-\nmentum of the accelerated atoms is given by\npN \t 2\u0004N\n j\np\n+ sgn\u0001\t\u0002\u0007\u000b\u0002G\u0007\t\u0007 . \u00013\u0002\nThe first quantum accelerator modes to be observed were\nthose for which p=1 \u00031\u0004. Since then, others with orders as\nhigh as 23 have been observed \u00036\u0004. We shall now focus on\nthese higher-order modes.\nC. Coexistence of quantum accelerator modes\nThe phase space generated by application of the mappings\nof Eq. \u00012\u0002 changes as the parameters K and \u0007 are varied. In\nexperiments to date, K and \u0007 have generally been varied\nsimultaneously by scanning T, and hence also \t \u00039\u0004. The\nstructure of the phase space may also be altered by varying\n\u0003d, and hence K alone, or by varying g, and hence \u0007 alone.\nAstute manipulation of these control parameters causes the\nMA et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW A 73, 013401 \u00012006\u0002\n013401-2\nphase-space structure to change from having one island sys-\ntem, to having another island system, with distinct \u0001p , j\u0002.\nThere may also be an intermediate regime where both island\nsystems coexist. The corresponding quantum accelerator\nmodes are then manifest, and different amounts of momen-\ntum can be transferred to several classes of the atoms evolv-\ning from the initial ensemble. That different quantum accel-\nerator modes dominate in different parameter regimes means\nthere is the possibility of quantum random walks, if one also\nmakes use of internal states of the trapped cold atomic\nsample, which are subject to different control parameters. We\nshall now consider some examples of the effect of altering\n\u0003d and g.\nD. Tuning the kicking strength\nWe first examine the high-order quantum accelerator\nmode close to the Talbot time, TT=133.4 \u0006s, for the case of\na single initial quasimomentum state. We take the value \f\n=0, and consider the case where T=132.0 \u0006s and the local\ngravity value g=9.81 ms\u22122. We apply two different kicking\nstrengths to the atoms \u0003d=0.8\u0004 and 2.4\u0004. The results of our\nnumerical simulations, shown in Figs. 1\u0001a\u0002 and 1\u0001b\u0002, demon-\nstrate that atoms evolving under \u0003d=0.8\u0004 undergo a nega-\ntive momentum transfer, while the atoms experiencing \u0003d\n=2.4\u0004 undergo a positive momentum transfer. The phase\nmaps given in Figs. 1\u0001e\u0002 and 1\u0001f\u0002, along with Eq. \u00013\u0002, show\nthat for the lower kicking strength the quantum accelerator\nmode is \u00015, 2\u0002, while for the higher kicking strength the\nquantum accelerator mode is \u00013, 1\u0002.\nWithin a given quasimomentum subspace, the values of J\navailable for the initial state are equal to \u0001k+\f\u0002\u0007\t\u0007, where k is\nan integer. In the case of a narrow initial momentum distri-\nbution, we expect the value of \f, offsetting the available\nmomentum spectrum, to affect the significance of that sub-\nspace\u2019s contribution to a physically observable quantum ac-\ncelerator mode. Such an effect is clearly of decreasing rel-\nevance as \t vanishes \u00034,5\u0004. This general observation is borne\nout by numerical simulation.\nFor the case of a thermal atomic cloud, such as the 1\n\b107 atoms at 5 \u0006K with a Gaussian initial momentum dis-\ntribution in which all \f are populated more-or-less equally,\nas used in our experiments, the dependence of the accelera-\ntion on the kicking strength is shown in Figs. 1\u0001c\u0002 and 1\u0001d\u0002.\nAs expected, the \u00015, 2\u0002 and \u00013, 1\u0002 quantum accelerator\nmodes, respectively, are produced. For this system, we can\nask at which kicking strength the different quantum accelera-\ntor modes appear. The variation of the population in each\nquantum accelerator mode as a function of \u0003d, deduced from\nthe numerical simulations, is shown in Fig. 2. When the\nkicking strength is less than 1.2\u0004, the atoms occupy the \u00015,\n2\u0002 mode and the \u00013, 1\u0002 mode is absent. As one increases the\nkicking strength, the \u00015, 2\u0002 mode gradually disappears while\nthe \u00013, 1\u0002 mode comes to dominate; on further increasing \u0003d,\nthe \u00015, 2\u0002 mode dies completely. There is a range of \u0003d,\ncentered on the value 1.6\u0004, where the quantum accelerator\nmodes coexist and atoms can be accelerated in two different\nmodes simultaneously, with different directions of momen-\ntum transfer.\nE. Tuning the effective gravitational acceleration\nIt is possible to vary the value of the effective gravita-\ntional acceleration applied to the atoms in our experiment,\nand hence \u0007. This is accomplished by using an electro-optic\nmodulator to vary the phase difference between the down-\ngoing and retro-reflected beams, and hence to move the pro-\nfile of the standing wave \u00033,8\u0004. This allows us to reach other\nparameter combinations that yield simultaneous acceleration\nin different directions. For example, if we tune the effective\ngravity to 20\u00b710 ms\u22122 and choose a kicking period of T\n=137.0 \u0006s, the occupied quantum accelerator mode is \u00015,\n\u22124\u0002 for the atoms which experience \u0003d=0.8\u0004 and \u00011,\u22121\u0002 for\nthose which evolve under \u0003d=2.4\u0004. The results of the cor-\nresponding numerical simulations are shown in Fig. 3.\nHence the momentum transferred by each kick can be\nvaried by properly selecting the effective gravitational accel-\neration, kicking period, and kicking strength in order to\nsingle out particular quantum accelerator modes. We have\nalso found a large number of other conditions where atoms\nare accelerated in different quantum accelerator modes, ac-\ncording to the value of \u0003d.\nFIG. 1. \u0001Color online\u0002 Numerical simulation for the quantum\naccelerator modes that are produced with g=9.81 ms\u22122, T\n=132.0 \u0006s.

INCORPORATION OF ELECTRONIC DEGREES OF\nFREEDOM\nA. Using an electronic superposition state\nWithin a given parameter regime, i.e., for particular val-\nues of \u0003d and g, and restricting ourselves to a single plane\nwave as the initial condition, it is not possible to optimally\noccupy two quantum accelerator modes for simultaneous ac-\nceleration. This can be understood by realizing that coexist-\ning quantum accelerator modes must necessarily occupy dif-\nferent regions of pseudoclassical phase space.\nAn efficient way to obtain simultaneous momentum trans-\nfer in two directions is to start with a coherent superposition\nof internal atomic states, to enable independent manipulation\nof \u0003d. These internal states experience different kicking\nstrengths. This allows us to have a situation where the same\ninitial motional state experiences two different kicking\nstrengths, and maximally occupies two different quantum ac-\ncelerator modes, resulting in different momentum transfers to\nthe two electronic components of the superposition.\nConsidering two general electronic states \u0007a\b and \u0007b\b, the\ndesired model Hamiltonian has the form \u00037\u0004\nH\u02c6 ab = H\u02c6 \u0001\u0003d\na\u0002\u0007a\b\fa\u0007 + H\u02c6 \u0001\u0003d\nb\u0002\u0007b\b\fb\u0007 +\n\u0002\u000eab\n2\n\u0001\u0007b\b\fb\u0007 \u2212 \u0007a\b\fa\u0007\u0002 ,\n\u00014\u0002\nwhere \u0002\u000eab is the energy gap between \u0007a\b and \u0007b\b, and H\u02c6 \u0001\u0003d\na\u0002\nand H\u02c6 \u0001\u0003d\nb\u0002 are equal to the atomic center of mass Hamil-\ntonian of Eq. \u00011\u0002, with \u0003d=\u0003d\na and \u0003d\nb\n, respectively. In our\nexperiments, \u0007a\b correspond to the \u0007F=3,mF=0\b substate of\nthe ground state of cesium, and \u0007b\b to the \u0007F=4,mF=0\b sub-\nstate; henceforth these substates will be denoted \u0007a\b and \u0007b\b,\nrespectively. The 9.18 GHz difference between the transition\nfrequencies from the states \u0007a\b and \u0007b\b to any given excited\nstate means that atoms in the two internal states will experi-\nence different values of \u0003d when exposed to laser light of a\nparticular intensity and detuning.\nThe population of cesium atoms in the states \u0007a\b and \u0007b\b\ncan be modified by a 9.18 GHz microwave pulse, resonant\nwith the \u0007b\b\u2192 \u0007a\b hyperfine transition \u00037\u0004. For example, a\ncoherent superposition of \u0007a\b and \u0007b\b can be achieved experi-\nmentally by applying a \u0004 \/2 microwave pulse to a sample of\natoms in state \u0007b\b, in which they are trapped and cooled. The\nintensity and detuning of the light creating the kicking po-\ntential can be selected so as to apply the correct values of \u0003d\nto the states \u0007a\b and \u0007b\b to permit efficient population of the\nrequired quantum accelerator modes. For example, with our\ncurrent experimental setup, it is feasible to have a value \u0003d\n=0.8\u0004 for state \u0007a\b, while the corresponding value for state\n\u0007b\b is \u0003d=2.4\u0004. Without any alteration to the effective value\nof g, atoms in \u0007b\b state will be kicked in one direction \u0003in the\n\u00013, 1\u0002 quantum accelerator mode\u0004 while atoms in \u0007a\b state\nwill be kicked in the other \u0003in the \u00015, 2\u0002 quantum accelerator\nmode\u0004, as shown in Fig. 1.

This may well lead to a type of\ninterferometry based on this beam splitting mechanism and\nwill be the subject of future investigations.\nB. State-dependent evolution\nIn this paper, however, we are focusing on the application\nof the technique of simultaneous momentum transfer that\nquantum accelerator modes provide to quantum random\nwalks. The state dependence of the momentum transfer per-\nmits the state-dependent evolution required for a quantum,\nrather than classical, random walk. With atoms initially in a\nsuperposition of the \u0007a\b and \u0007b\b states, we can apply kicks to\naccelerate the atoms in the two states in different directions.\nTo investigate how the methods of manipulating the inter-\nnal state of the atoms permit momentum control, we numeri-\ncally simulate a sequence in which we accelerate atoms in\nstate \u0007b\b for 25 kicks with \u0003d=2.2\u0004, and we then apply a \u0004\nmicrowave pulse to pump all atoms from state \u0007b\b into state\n\u0007a\b, for which \u0003d=0.7\u0004. T=132.0 \u0006s and g=9.81 ms\u22122 are\nkept constant during the process. The results of the simula-\ntion are shown in Fig. 4. After the switch, atoms in \u0007b\b cease\nincreasing momentum in their original direction and about\n30% of them begin to accumulate momentum in the opposite\ndirection, corresponding to the quantum accelerator mode\nwith the lower kicking strength. Optimization of the effi-\nciency of transfer from one quantum accelerator mode to the\nother needs a more detailed investigation, as we now discuss.\nC. Optimizing the switch property\nAn ideal switch between different momentum transfer\nmodes requires the wave function of one quantum accelera-\ntor mode to have an overlap with the other mode at the time\nof switching. From the FGR analysis, this implies that better\nswitching efficiency will occur when the stable islands in\npseudoclassical phase space for the two quantum accelerator\nmodes overlap \u00039\u0004.\nThis is illustrated in Fig. 5, where g=7.26 ms\u22122, T\n=131.0 \u0006s, \u0003d=0.6\u0004, and 3.8\u0004 for two different states. The\noverlap between the stable islands for the lower kicking\nstrength \u0003mode \u00011, 0\u0002, blue dots\u0004 and the higher kicking\nstrength \u0003mode \u00014, 1\u0002, red dots\u0004 in Fig. 5\u0001a\u0002 is greater than\nthat in Figs. 1\u0001e\u0002 and 1\u0001f\u0002, or Figs. 3\u0001e\u0002 and 3\u0001f\u0002. This, as we\nwould expect, leads to a more efficient transfer of population\nbetween the quantum accelerator modes when the atomic\ninternal state is flipped by a microwave pulse, as shown by\nthe comparison between Fig. 5\u0001b\u0002 and Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002. About 80%\nof the atoms are successfully transferred from one mode to\nthe other.\nThe \t-classical map thus provides the capability of using\nthe overlap criterion to search in parameter space to find the\nbest switching condition. A complete search of the relevant\nphase space is a substantial enterprise, and will be part of a\nlonger term effort to optimize the operation of a practical\nrandom-walker.\nIV. NEAR-IDEAL BIASED QUANTUM RANDOM WALK\nA. Quantum and classical random walks\nWe now turn to the implementation of a quantum random\nwalk using the state-dependent acceleration process we have\njust described. The concept of a quantum random walk was\nintroduced by Aharonov et al. \u000310\u0004. In different, subse-\nquently introduced models of quantum random walks, the\nHadamard-style model is often discussed where a particle\nevolves into a coherent superposition of moving one step to\nthe right and one step to the left along a line. As shown in\nprevious theoretical work \u000311\u0004, a particle with internal de-\ngrees of freedom is required to achieve this. In this model,\neach step of the quantum random walk consists of a Had-\namard operation and a subsequent controlled-walk operation\nS, which moves the atoms left or right, according to their\ninternal state. Assuming a particle with two internal states \u0007a\b\nand \u0007b\b, the walking operator is represented by\nS = \u0007a\b\fa\u0007 \u0001\u0005\nm\n\u0007m \u2212 1\b\fm\u0007 + \u0007b\b\fb\u0007 \u0001\u0005\nm\n\u0007m + 1\b\fm\u0007 . \u00015\u0002\nThe Hadamard operator, introduced to reshuffle the atoms in\nthe internal states after each step, reads\nH = \r1 11 \u2212 1 \u000e , \u00016\u0002\nand acts such that H\u0007a\b=1\/\u000f2\u0001\u0007a\b+ \u0007b\b\u0002, H\u0007b\b=1\/\u000f2\u0001\u0007a\b\n\u2212 \u0007b\b\u0002.\nFIG. 4. \u0001Color online\u0002\u0001a\u0002 Momentum variation with number of\nkicks, for \f=0, \u0003d=2.2\u0004 for state \u0007a\b and \u0003d=0.7\u0004 for state \u0007b\b,\nwith T=132.0 \u0006s and g=9.81 ms\u22122. A state-flipping microwave\npulse is applied after the 25th kick.

With a\nsufficient number of steps n, the time averaged position of\nthe particle approaches a normal distribution on the line,\nwith the standard deviation of \u000fn.\nHowever, in the case of a quantum random walk, the stan-\ndard deviation increases with n. This essential difference of\nthe quantum random walk is due to the possibility of inter-\nference in quantum mechanics. Unlike the symmetric Gauss-\nian distribution in the population for classical random walks\nin the limit of large n, the probability distribution of quantum\nrandom walk has sharp peaks at high momenta, and may be\nasymmetric, depending on the initial state. It is evident that\nthe interference pattern of a quantum random walk is much\nmore intricate than the Gaussian obtained in the classical\ncase.\nIn general one observes a two-peaked distribution. If all\natoms are initially in state \u0007a\b the position distribution drifts\nto the left, i.e., the left-hand peak is larger. This asymmetry\ncomes from the fact that the Hadamard coin treats the two\ndirections, \u0007a\b and \u0007b\b, differently. The walk operator multi-\nplies the phase by \u22121 in the case of \u0007b\b only. This induces\ncancellations for paths going rightwards \u0001destructive interfer-\nence\u0002, whereas particles moving to the left interfere construc-\ntively. Conversely, we can also cause the atoms to preferen-\ntially drift to the right, with an initial condition having all\natoms in state \u0007b\b \u000311\u0004. The probability at the even points is\nzero between those nonzero probability of odd points, which\nis also due to interference of \u0007a\b and \u0007b\b states.\nB. Biased quantum random walks\nWith a quantum accelerator mode, we can apply a \u0004 \/2\nmicrowave pulse after each kick is equivalent to the \u201ccoin-\nflipping.\u201d As discussed above, different quantum accelerator\nmodes, specific to the different internal states, can cause dif-\nferent momentum transfer to the atoms with each alternative\nkick, giving different walking speeds in the two directions.\nThis scheme then introduces different features from the Aha-\nronov model, and we therefore name this model a \u201cbiased\u201d\nquantum random walk in momentum space. In a biased\nquantum walk, the \u201ccoined\u201d state, which determines the di-\nrection atoms move in by the extra degree of freedom of\n\u201ccoin sides\u201d \u0001discussed in Ref. \u000310\u0004\u0002, is the pair of hyperfine\nstates of the atoms and the momentum transfer per step, i.e.,\nthe walk speed, is determined by the order of quantum ac-\ncelerator modes. This can be altered \u0003see Eq. \u00013\u0002\u0004 by select-\ning different values of the parameters K and \u0007 that deter-\nmine the acceleration. In this way atoms can be made to\nperform a Hadamard-style quantum random walk in momen-\ntum space \u000324\u0004.\nIt is important to note that atoms are divided to three\ndifferent classes in the case of quantum accelerator modes\nconsidered here: two of them fall into two different accelera-\ntor modes, thus obtaining different momentum changes in\neach step, and the rest of the atoms are \u201cleft behind.\u201d There\nis an overall recoil in the opposite direction to the quantum\naccelerator modes \u000325\u0004, but within this, the motion is diffu-\nsive rather than the coherent motion of quantum accelerator\nmodes. In order to understand better how such a system\ncould be used to realize a quantum random walk we propose\nthe following simplified model. Our model is a \u201cbiased quan-\ntum random walk\u201d for our coined quantum accelerator mode,\nwhere atoms not only walk in two different directions, but\ncan be left behind.\nThe walk operator S then reads\nS = \u00011 \u2212 \u000f\u0002\u0001\u0007a\b\fa\u0007 \u0001\u0005\nk\n\u0007k \u2212 \u00011\b\fk\u0007 + \u0007b\b\fb\u0007 \u0001\u0005\nk\n\u0007k + \u00012\b\fk\u0007\u0002\n+ \u000f\u0005\nk\n\u0007k\b\fk\u0007 , \u00017\u0002\nwhere \u000f is the \u201cleaving behind\u201d amplitude. Related back to\nthe model system described by the quantum \u0001-kicked accel-\nerator Hamiltonian, the integer k indicates the momentum\nstates \u0001integer multiples of \u0002G \u000326\u0004\u0002, and \u00011 and \u00012 corre-\nspond to the momentum increment per kick induced by two\ndifferent quantum accelerator modes \u0001p1 , j1\u0002 and \u0001p2 , j2\u0002.\nThe results of the numerical simulation of this biased\nquantum random walk are shown in Fig. 6. Quantum accel-\nerator modes increase the momentum of a group of atoms\nlinearly with the number of kicks, and this means that the\neffective \u201cdiffusion\u201d of the biased walk will also be linearly\nproportional to the number of kicks, or \u201csuperdiffusive.\u201d We\nshould expect atoms moving faster in one direction than the\nother due to the difference in the walking speeds of the two\noccupied quantum accelerator modes. Walks with nonzero\nvalues of the parameter \u000f have very different distributions\nfrom those with \u000f=0. In particular walks with \u000f\u00010 will fill\nup the momentum gaps produced by a \u201cpure\u201d \u000f=0 quantum\nrandom walk.\nFIG. 6. \u0001Color online\u0002 The momentum distribution \u0001in arbitrary\nunits\u0002 of the biased quantum random walk with a Hadamard coin\nafter 50 steps, starting in state \u0007a\b\u0001 \u00070\b for \u0001a\u0002 and \u0001c\u0002, and state\n\u0007b\b\u0001 \u00070\b for \u0001b\u0002 and \u0001d\u0002. The parameter \u000f, defined in Eq. \u00017\u0002, is 0 for\n\u0001a\u0002, \u0001b\u0002 and 0.5 for \u0001c\u0002, \u0001d\u0002. The momentum increase is 0.25 units\nper step to the negative direction and 0.1 units per step to the\npositive direction.\nMA et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW A 73, 013401 \u00012006\u0002\n013401-6\nFrom Fig. 5 about 80% of atoms have a good switch from\none mode to another and 20% are left behind, for appropriate\nvalues of \f, g, and \u0003d. In this way, atoms could perform\nquantum random walk for several steps. A future study to\nperfect the switching property is necessary. The value of\nsuch walks in search algorithms, and ways of varying \u000f, will\nbe the subject of future work. In this paper we simply want\nto emphasis the potential interest and value of state-\ndependent momentum transfer in quantum accelerator\nmodes, of the type we investigate here.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, we have described a way to produce state-\ndependent momentum transfer in a group of atoms. We be-\nlieve that this offers a route to produce quantum random\nwalks in the laboratory with feasible experimental param-\neters. In particular, the next generation of experiments with\nenhanced velocity selection will put practical realizations\nwell within reach. The state-dependent walk controlled\nthrough the parameters of the external perturbation is worthy\nof investigation in its own right. There are three independent\ncontrol parameters in the basic \u0001-kicked accelerator, namely,\nthe driving strength, the effective gravitational acceleration,\nand the value of the commutator \u0007\t\u0007. In an atom-optical con-\nfiguration these can all be tuned independently. There are\nthus many parameter regimes available particularly when\nconsidering the additional degrees of freedom offered by su-\nperposition states. The full range of such phenomena, and\ntheir relevance to quantum random walks, quantum reso-\nnances, and quantum chaos in superposition states, awaits\nexploration.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank R. M.
