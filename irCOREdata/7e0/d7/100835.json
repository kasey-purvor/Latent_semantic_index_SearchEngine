INTRODUCTION\nTHERE IS a rapidly growing interest in building siliconintegrated electronics on arbitrary substrates like glass\nor plastics to achieve seamless monolithic integration of hu-\nman interface devices (displays or sensors) with the driving\ncircuitry, signal processing integrated circuits, memories, and\nother related functional units [1]\u2013[3]. Whether digital or analog,\nthese integrated electronics depend critically on the current\nflowing in the basic elements\u2014transistors, in normally off\nor subthreshold regime of operation. A low leakage current\n(IOFF) and a steep subthreshold swing (S) standing for high\nswitching performance are required to achieve high transcon-\nductance, and these enable a low voltage swing to achieve\nthe required on\u2013off current ratio (ION\/IOFF) for high-speed\nand low power consumption [4]. However, the quality of the\nsilicon films being achieved on these substrates is severely\nconstrained by materials and substrate process limitations, re-\nsulting in amorphous and nano- or microcrystalline materials\n[5], [6]. The disorder in the material introduces a wide range\nof defects in the bandgap, which range from states caused by\nManuscript received January 9, 2008; revised February 15, 2008.

First, carrier transport occurs via hopping\nor tunneling between states, leading to low effective mobility\nand, thus, low ON-state current [8]. Second, the presence of\ndefects in the semiconductor layers leads to a decreasing effect\nof gate voltage on the surface potential, which in turn induces\nlarge S value [9]. Third, the trap states in the bandgap may\nassist the generation of carriers at the drain junction via\nthermionic emission or thermionic field emission of carriers,\nthus causing anomalous large leakage current [10]. In a previ-\nous work, the ultrathin channel transistor was demonstrated as\nan excellent candidate for ultralow power memory design [11].\nIn this letter, theoretical analysis and experimental results show\nthat, for transistors in disordered silicon, using an ultrathin\nchannel can contribute to steep S and exponentially decreased\nIOFF, potentially for high switching performance.\nII. BASIC PRINCIPLES\nAs theoretically predicted and also experimentally observed\n[12]\u2013[14], when the silicon film thickness (tSi) is reduced\nto a few nanometers, quantum confinement would result in\nmodulation of the band structure, which gives rise to band-edge\nshifts in both the conduction- and valence-band minima relative\nto bulk silicon, thereby effectively increasing the bandgap (Eg).\nThe increase of Eg can be derived as [15]\n\u2206Eg = \u2206EC0 + \u2206EV 0 = h2\/8m\u2217et2Si + h2\/8m\u2217ht2Si (1)\nwhere \u2206EC0 and \u2206EV 0 are the band-edge shifts in the\nconduction- and valence-band minima, respectively, h is the\nPlanck constant, and m\u2217e and m\u2217h are the quantization effective\nmasses of electron and hole, respectively.\nTransistors in disordered silicon behave in a very similar\nfashion to crystalline device, and the energy barrier between the\nsource and the channel governs charge transport in the inversion\nlayer [9]. The height of the energy barrier \u03a6SC is given by\n\u03a6SC =\nEg\n2\n+ \u03a6F \u2212\u03a8S (2)\nwhere \u03a6F is the Fermi level, and \u03a8S is the channel surface\npotential.\nBelow threshold, charge carriers have to traverse the barrier\nwhen diffusing from source to drain, as shown in Fig. 1.

Schematic band diagram of the thin-film transistor in disordered\nsilicon, showing the discrete energy levels originating from carrier confinement\nin the thin channel, the subthreshold leakage current (Isub) generated by\ncarriers traversing the barrier between the source and the channel, and the\njunction leakage (Ijun) arising by electron\u2013hole pairs generated via traps near\nthe midgap at drain junction through thermal emission or thermionic field\nemission [10].\nsubthreshold current (Isub) can be expressed to first order as a\nfunction of \u03a6SC as follows:\nIsub \u221d exp\n(\n\u2212 q\nkT\n\u00b7 \u03a6SC\n)\n(3)\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute tempera-\nture, and q is the electron charge.\nQuantum confinement increases Eg and can thereby effec-\ntively reduce Isub. For transistors in disordered silicon, it has\nbeen found that the anomalously high leakage current arises\nby electron\u2013hole pairs generated via traps near the midgap at\ndrain junction through thermal emission or thermionic field\nemission [10], as shown in Fig. 1, and the junction leakage\n(Ijun) can be given as Ijun \u221d exp(\u2212(qEg\/2kT )). Thus, the\nquantum confinement is also able to effectively reduce the\njunction leakage and, therefore, the total OFF-state leakage\ncurrent IOFF as\nIOFF = Isub + Ijun \u221d exp\n(\n\u2212 qEg\n2kT\n)\n. (4)\nWhereas in the ON-state, the barrier height between the source\nand the channel diminishes because the increased VGS brings\nhigh channel surface potential \u03a8S . The bandgap-widening ef-\nfect becomes much less pronounced, and the ON-state current\ndepends on the drift of majority carriers through the channel\nunder the applied electric field. Therefore, as the channel be-\ncomes thinner, quantum confinement gets stronger, and higher\nION\/IOFF can be achieved.\nFurthermore, when the channel becomes thinner, the effect of\nVGS on \u03a8S increases, thus resulting in a steeper subthreshold\nswing (S), as follows [9]:\nd\u03a8S\ndVGS\n\u2248 Cox\nq \u00b7 dc \u00b7Dt (5)\nFig. 2.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nThe devices used for this letter are nanocrystalline sili-\ncon thin-film transistors fabricated on p-type silicon substrate,\nwhich are composed of a thin layer of undoped nanocrystalline\nsilicon, a gate insulator of 22.5-nm silicon oxide, and a 100-nm-\nthick layer of phosphorous-doped poly-Si as the gate electrode.\nThe channel thickness varies from 8.0 to 2.0 nm. The precise\nchannel thickness is achieved by controlling the chemical vapor\ndeposition process at a very low deposition rate, and the average\ngrain size of the channel is estimated from the planar trans-\nmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs about 10 nm.\nDetails of the fabrication process can be referred to [11] and\n[16]. Micrographs of the final structure of fabricated devices\nare given in the inset in Fig. 2. The devices have good intrachip\nuniformity of electrical characteristics, even when the channel\nis as thin as 2.0 nm, as shown in Fig. 2, where the extracted\nthreshold voltage (Vth) values for the devices in different dies\non the same chip are plotted.\nThe IDS\u2013VGS characteristics of the devices with different\nthick channels at a drain bias of 1.0 V are shown in Fig. 3(a).\nSince the devices exhibit extremely small leakage current, the\ndata are obtained through converting the measurements for\n500 parallel transistors to a per-transistor result. Fig. 3(b) shows\nthe IOFF reduction (\u03b7rat) and S as a function of tSi. IOFF is\nextracted as the IDS value at the bottom point of the IDS\u2013VGS\ncurves in Fig. 3(a), which is corresponding to the lowest IOFF\nvalue that the devices can reach after optimization of the voltage\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

(b) Leakage-\ncurrent (IOFF) reduction (\u03b7rat) as a function of channel thickness (tSi)\n(\u0001: Experimental results; \u2014: Theoretical calculations). The \u03b7rat for a device is\nthe ratio of its IOFF over the value for the device with an 8-nm-thick channel.\nInset: Subthreshold swing (S) as a function of tSi (\u25e6: Experimental results;\n\u2014: Theoretical calculations).\nbias. The \u03b7rat for a device is the ratio of its IOFF over the value\nfor the device with an 8-nm-thick channel, and based on (4), it\ncan be approximately expressed as\n\u03b7rat =\nIOFF(tSi)\nIOFF(tSi = 8 nm)\n\u221d exp\n(\n\u2212q \u00b7\u2206Eg(tSi)\n2kT\n)\n(7)\nwhere \u2206Eg(tSi) is the bandgap widening relative to the\nbandgap for the 8-nm-thick channel devices.\nAlthough we used 500 parallel transistors to make the small\ncurrent observable, IOFF values of the 2.0-nm-thick channel\ndevices were still too small to be measured and were roughly\nestimated from the measurable parts in the IDS\u2013VGS curves.\nApplying this method to the thicker channel devices, we ob-\nserved that although the obtained results are not exactly equal\nto the measured ones, they are well in the same order. Thus,\nthis estimation will not have influence on the conclusion to\nbe made in this letter. From Fig. 3(b), it can be seen that\nIOFF decreases dramatically as tSi is reduced. By assuming an\nelectron effective mass of 0.19 me (electron mass) and a hole\neffective mass of 0.49 me, the bandgap widening for devices\nwith different thick channels is calculated based on (1), and\nthereafter, \u03b7rat values are obtained through (7), which can be\nseen to fit well with the experimental results, as shown in\nFig. 3(b).\nThis proves that the marked reduction of IOFF in thinner\nchannel devices is due to stronger quantum confinement.\nFig. 3(b) also shows a steeper S in the devices with a thinner\nchannel, just as predicted by (5) and (6). The S values were\nextracted by using the conventional definition as the inverse\nslope of the log(IDS)\u2013VGS curves in the subthreshold regime.\nThe 2.0-nm-thick channel device has an S value of about\n100 mV\/dec. Based on (2), the effect of VGS on the surface\npotential d\u03a8S\/dVGS in the subthreshold regime can be derived\nFig. 4. ION\/IOFF current ratio as a function of channel thickness (tSi).\nInset: Definition of ION and IOFF\u2212IOFF is extracted as the IDS value at\nthe bottom point of the IDS\u2013VGS curves; ION is extracted as the IDS at the\nVGS_ON = 2.5 V + VGS_OFF, where VGS_OFF is the gate voltage at the\nbottom point of the IDS\u2013VGS curves (the point where IOFF is extracted).\nas the negative value of the slope of \u03a6SC versus VGS, which\nwere obtained through the Arrhenius plot of the drain current\nversus the inverse of the absolute temperature in the tempera-\nture range of 30 \u25e6C\u2212120 \u25e6C in this letter. Then, based on (6),\nS values for devices with different thick channels were cal-\nculated and compared with the measured results in Fig. 3(b),\nshowing good agreement. A steeper S in the thinner channel\ndevices will allow a smaller VGS swing to achieve the required\nION\/IOFF ratio.\nAt a given gate voltage swing, the decreased IOFF and the\nimproved subthreshold slope result in higher ION\/IOFF ratio\nfor the thinner channel devices, as shown in Fig. 4. To extract\nthe ION values of devices with different channel thicknesses,\nfor comparison, we fix the gate voltage swing at 2.5 V, and ION\nis extracted as the IDS at the VGS_ON = 2.5 V + VGS_OFF,\nwhere VGS_OFF is the gate voltage at the bottom point of the\nIDS\u2013VGS curves (also the point where IOFF is extracted), as\nshown in the inset in Fig. 4. For the 2.0-nm-thick channel de-\nvices, ION\/IOFF ratio of more than 1011 was achieved, which\ncan never be obtained for normal thick channel transistors in\ndisordered silicon.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nBy theoretical analysis and experimental results, it is proved\nthat using an ultrathin channel effectively improves the switch-\ning performance of thin-film transistors in disordered silicon.\nWhen the channel becomes thinner, the OFF-state current IOFF\ndecreases significantly, which is attributed to the stronger quan-\ntum confinement along the channel thickness direction, and the\nsubthreshold swing (S) also becomes steeper because the effect\nof VGS on the channel surface potential \u03a8S increases. The low\nIOFF and the steep S result in high ION\/IOFF ratio, which\nexceeds 1011 for the devices with a 2.0-nm-thick channel at\na given gate voltage swing of 2.5 V. The high ION\/IOFF will\nenable to design integrated electronics on arbitrary substrates\nfor applications where low power and fast access times are\ndemanded.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.
