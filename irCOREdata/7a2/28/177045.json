An elevated pre-operative white cell count (WCC) has been associated \nwith a worse outcome following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Leukocyte \nsub-types, and in particular the N\/L ratio, may, however, convey superior prognostic \ninformation. We hypothesized that the N\/L ratio would predict the outcome of patients \nundergoing surgical revascularization. The current study tests this hypothesis. \nMethods. Baseline clinical details were obtained prospectively in 1,938 patients \nundergoing CABG. The differential leukocyte was measured 1 day before surgery and \npatients were followed-up 3.6 years later. The primary end-point was all-cause mortality. \nResults. The pre-operative N\/L ratio was a powerful univariable predictor of mortality \n(hazard ratio [HR] 1.13 per unit, p<0.001). In a backward conditional model, including \nall other study variables, it remained a strong predictor (HR 1.09 per unit, p=0.004). In a \nfurther model, including the European system for cardiac operative risk evaluation, the \nN\/L ratio remained an independent predictor (HR 1.08 per unit, p=0.008). Likewise, it \nwas an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality and predicted death in the \nsubgroup of patients with a normal WCC (<10 x 109 per litre). This excess hazard was \nconcentrated in patients with a N\/L ratio in the upper quartile (>3.36). \nConclusion. An elevated N\/L ratio is associated with a poorer survival after CABG. This \nprognostic utility is independent of other recognized risk factors. \n \n 4\nCoronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is associated with a small but significant \nincidence of morbidity and mortality. While methods of risk assessment, such as the \nEuropean system for cardiac operative risk evaluation (EuroSCORE), are widely \nemployed, there are limits to their predictive ability.1 There remains, therefore, a need for \nadditional methods of risk stratification, particularly if these are easily obtained and \nwidely available. \n \nThe role of low-grade inflammation in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and its acute \ncomplications is well-recognized,2 and several biological markers of inflammation \npredict cardiovascular risk.3,4 One of the most readily available indices is the total \nleukocyte count. This foretells cardiovascular events in unselected adults,5,6 in patients \nwith stable angina,7,8 and in the acute coronary syndromes.9,10 The total white cell count \n(WCC) has also been recently found to predict mortality following CABG.11-13 This may \nreflect an association with the severity and\/or activity of atherosclerosis. It may also be \ndue to direct cardiac and vascular injury initiated by leukocytes following myocardial \nischemia. \n \nThe total leukocyte count does, however, have limitations \u2013 the link between leukocytosis \nand outcome is complex and non-linear,14,15 not all studies reveal an independent \nassociation16 and many have demonstrated confounding relationships with other risk \nfactors such as smoking.17 There is, therefore, interest in analysis of white cell subtypes. \nFor example, much of the predictive power of the total leukocyte count is contained in \nthe neutrophil component.18-20 Likewise, a reduced lymphocyte count has also been \n 5\nassociated with poorer prognosis.15,21,22 The predictive value of these indices has been \ncombined by calculating the neutrophil\/lymphocyte (N\/L) ratio. This may be a more \npowerful predictor of cardiovascular risk than the total WCC or individual white cell \nsubtypes.23,24,25 However, the prognostic utility of the N\/L ratio has not previously been \nevaluated in patients undergoing surgical revascularization. We hypothesized that, \nparticularly given the relationship between leukocytes and the myocardial and vascular \ninjury that follows ischemia, the N\/L ratio would predict outcome in this setting.  \n \nMETHODS \nThe study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and ethical approval was granted by \nthe local Research Ethics Committee. Between April 2000 and March 2004, 2,076 \nconsecutive patients underwent CABG in our institution. Seventy-six patients who \nunderwent emergency surgery and\/or CABG within 1 week of acute myocardial \ninfarction were excluded, as were 62 patients who had no pre-operative (<1 week before \nCABG) leukocyte count available. The study cohort comprised the remaining 1,938 \nsubjects. Baseline clinical data, including Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina status, \nNew York Heart Association functional class and the EuroSCORE, were collected \nprospectively. \n \nTwo hundred and eight patients (10.7%) underwent other major operative procedures in \naddition to CABG. These included 191 valve replacement or repair procedures (145 \naortic [1 with aortic root replacement], 43 mitral and 3 combined aortic and mitral). \nThere were 9 left ventricular aneurysm resections, 3 thoracic aortic procedures (without \n 6\nvalve replacement), 2 atrial myxoma resections, 2 ventricular septal defect repairs and 1 \npericardiectomy. \n \nAll analyses used the blood sample obtained immediately prior to surgery. Differential \nleukocyte count was obtained using an Advia 2120 Hematology System (Bayer \nHealthCare, Tarrytown, NY). This automated analyser exhibits an excellent correlation \nwith manual cell counts and has co-efficients of variation of <2.5% for the total white cell \ncount, <1.5% for the neutrophil count and <2.9% for the lymphocyte count.26 The total \nWCC, neutrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte counts were recorded. In addition, the pre-\noperative N\/L ratio was calculated. \n \nFollow up \nPatients were followed up using a vital events search by the General Register Office for \nScotland. The primary end-point was all-cause mortality. Cause of death was defined as \ncardiac if this was listed as the primary cause or a contributory factor on the death \ncertificate. The duration of hospitalization was also recorded. \n \nStatistical analyses \nCategorical data are summarized using absolute values (percentage). Normally \ndistributed continuous data are presented as mean (standard deviation) or, where skewed, \nas median (interquartile range). Survival was described using the Kaplan-Meier method \nand comparison made using the log-rank statistic. Estimations of risk were performed \nusing Cox regression. Backward conditional multivariable models of survival were \n 7\ndeveloped. One of these included all variables and a second included white cell indices \nplus the EuroSCORE. Retention in these models was set at a significance level of <0.05. \n \nThe hazard associated with different quartiles of N\/L ratio was assessed using Cox \nregression, using either the lowest quartile as the reference or comparing the upper \nquartile with all others. Power calculations for the log-rank test were used as an \napproximate method to assess whether the Cox regression would have sufficient power to \ndetect differences in hazard between the quartiles. In a comparison of two groups of 483 \npatients (the minimum number in each quartile) a hazard ratio of 2 could be detected with \n95% power with a minimum of 100 events (deaths) in the two groups combined. \n \nComparisons of the clinical characteristics and the duration of post-operative hospital \nstay of patients with differing quartiles of N\/L ratio were compared using the chi-squared \ntest for trend (for categorical variables) and analysis of variance or the Jonckheere-\nTerpstra test (for normally and non-normally distributed continuous variables \nrespectively). SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois) was used for all analyses. \n 8\nRESULTS \nPatient population and outcome \nThe study cohort were predominantly male with a median age of 66 years (table I). The \ndifferential leukocyte count was measured a median of 1 (1-3) day before surgery. The \nmedian total WCC was 7.5 (6.4-8.9) x 109 per litre with a median N\/L ratio of 2.43 (1.86-\n3.36). Two-hundred and twenty six patients (12%) had a WCC above 10 x 109 per litre. \nVital status data were available for all patients. During a median of 3.6 (1.4-4.7) years \nfollow-up 177 patients (9%) died, 154 from primarily or partly cardiovascular causes. \nFifty deaths (28%) occurred within the first 30-days of surgery. \n \nUnivariable predictors of mortality \nThe total WCC was not predictive of mortality (table I). This remained the case even \nwhen the total WCC was divided in to categories (<6, 6.0-7.9, 8.0-9.9, 10.0-11.9 and >12 \nx 109 per litre) or quartiles (HR 1.01, p=0.86 and HR 0.79 for upper quartile v lowest \nquartile, p=0.29, respectively). A higher neutrophil count was associated with an \nincreased risk of death, whereas a lower pre-operative lymphocyte count was a strong \nunivariable predictor of mortality: as was the pre-operative N\/L ratio (table I). \n \nMultivariable predictors of mortality \nThe neutrophil and lymphocyte counts and the N\/L ratio are mathematically related. The \nN\/L ratio was a stronger univariable predictor of outcome (\u03c72 27.4) than the neutrophil \ncount (\u03c72 3.2) or lymphocyte count (\u03c72 18.4) and, in this cohort, when the N\/L ratio was \nused its components provided no additional prognostic information. Therefore, the N\/L \n 9\nratio was entered in all subsequent regression models. Likewise, cardiopulmonary bypass \nand cross-clamp times are closely related. The former was, however, the stronger \npredictor of outcome and, when this was available, cross-clamp time provided no \nincremental information regarding prognosis. Cardiopulmonary bypass time was, \ntherefore, used in all multivariable models.  \n \nThe first model included all variables shown in table I except EuroSCORE - which is a \ncomposite that includes several of these parameters and is widely used to predict peri-\noperative risk, but has also been demonstrated to be a useful predictor of long-term \noutcome.27-29 The independent predictors of mortality in this model are shown in table II. \nIn a further model, including the pre-operative total WCC, the pre-operative monocyte \ncount, the pre-operative N\/L ratio and EuroSCORE, the only independent predictors of \noutcome were the N\/L ratio (HR 1.08 per unit, 95% CI 1.02-1.15, p=0.008) and the \nEuroSCORE (HR 1.25 per unit, 95% CI 1.19-1.32, p<0.001). \n \nSecondary analyses \nCardiovascular mortality \nWhen only cardiovascular death was considered an end-point, the N\/L ratio remained a \nunivariable predictor (HR 1.12 per unit, 95% CI 1.06-1.18, p<0.001), as did the pre-\noperative lymphocyte (HR 0.57 per 1x109 per litre, 95% CI 0.44-0.75, p<0.001) and \nmonocyte (HR 1.59 per 1x109 per litre, 95% CI 1.16-2.17, p=0.004) counts. In contrast, \nneither the total WCC (HR 0.97 per 1x109 per litre, 95% CI 0.91-1.04, p=0.44) or \n 10\nneutrophil count (HR 1.03 per 1x109 per litre, 95% CI 0.94-1.13, p=0.49) predicted \ncardiovascular mortality. \n \nIn a multivariable model, including all variables shown in table I except EuroSCORE the \nN\/L ratio remained an independent predictor of cardiovascular death (HR 1.11 per unit, \n95% CI 1.03-1.19, p=0.01), as did the pre-operative monocyte count (HR 1.49 per 1x109 \nper litre, 95% CI 1.08-2.05, p=0.02). The other independent predictors of cardiac death \nwere time on cardiopulmonary bypass (HR 1.04 per 10 minutes, p<0.001), estimated \nglomerular filtration rate (HR 0.97 per mL\/min per 1.73m2, p<0.001), requirement for a \nmajor cardiac surgical procedure in addition to CABG (HR 1.99, p=0.003), ejection \nfraction <50% (HR 1.91, p=0.001) and diabetes mellitus (HR 1.65, P=0.02). In a model \nincluding the pre-operative total WCC, the pre-operative monocyte count, the pre-\noperative N\/L ratio and EuroSCORE, the only independent predictors of cardiovascular \ndeath were the N\/L ratio (HR 1.08 per unit, 95% CI 1.00-1.16, p=0.046) and the \nEuroSCORE (HR 1.28 per unit, 95% CI 1.21-1.35, p<0.001). \n \nPatients with normal white cell count only \nIn patients with a normal total WCC (\u226410 x 109 per litre, n=1,712) the N\/L ratio remained \na powerful univariable predictor of all-cause mortality (HR 1.18 per unit, 95% CI 1.11-\n1.26, p<0.001). The pre-operative lymphocyte count also remained a strong predictor \n(HR 0.51 per 1x109 per litre, 95% CI 0.38-0.68, P<0.001), but neither the total WCC or \nany other leukocyte subsets were predictive of death in this subgroup.  \n \n 11\nIn multivariable models, similar to those described above, N\/L ratio remained an \nindependent predictor of outcome (HR 1.15 per unit, 95% CI 1.07-1.24, p<0.001 in a \nmodel including all other variables and HR 1.14 per unit, 95% CI 1.06-1.23, p=0.001 in a \nmodel including total WCC, monocyte count and EuroSCORE). \n \nQuartiles of neutrophil\/lymphocyte ratio \nThe excess risk was observed in patients with N\/L ratios in the upper quartile (table III \nand figure 1). In univariable analysis, the hazard associated with a N\/L ratio in the highest \nquartile (v all others) was 2.09, 95% CI 1.54-2.84, p<0.001. In backward conditional \nmultivariable models, firstly including all variables shown in table II and then the \nEuroSCORE, pre-operative WCC and monocyte count, the independent hazard associated \nwith a N\/L ratio in the upper quartile was 1.72, 95% CI 1.25-2.36, p=0.001 and 1.53, \n95% CI 1.13-2.13, p=0.008, respectively. A relationship between the quartile of N\/L ratio \nand length of post-operative hospitalization was also observed (p<0.001). Patients with \nhigher N\/L ratios tended to be older, have poorer renal function and a higher EuroSCORE \n(table IV). They were also more likely to require re-intubation following surgery and had \na tendency towards higher cardiac troponin I levels at 24 hours following surgery. \n \nDISCUSSION \nThe current data demonstrate that in patients undergoing CABG the N\/L ratio conveys \npowerful prognostic information that is independent of other conventional clinical risk \nfactors. Patients with N\/L ratios in the upper quartile are at particularly high risk. \n \n 12\nTotal white cell count \nPrior data have suggested that an elevated leukocyte count is associated with a worse \ncardiovascular outcome in a variety of settings.17 It has also been reported to predict \nincreased mortality following CABG.11-13 A relationship between pre-operative total \nWCC and mortality was not observed in the current cohort. The explanation for this is not \nclear. Our cohort is an unselected consecutive population similar to others in which the \ntotal leukocyte count has proved to be prognostic. Likewise, the mean, median and \ndistribution of the WCC are almost identical to those reported in comparable studies.11-13 \nTwo of these12,13 included emergency and peri-infarct cases. However, Bagger and \ncolleagues demonstrated a persisting relationship of WCC in sub-group analysis, when \nemergency and post-infarct cases were excluded.11\n \nThere is evidence of a biphasic, or J-shaped, relationship between total WCC and \nmortality following myocardial infarction30 and percutaneous coronary intervention.31 \nThis might diminish the overall predictive value of the WCC. However, in the current \ncohort we found no evidence of such a relationship - possibly reflecting the selected \npopulation that undergoes CABG. \n \nThe absence of any relationship between total WCC and survival may relate to the effects \nof medication. The Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease study \nshowed that the WCC predicted cardiovascular mortality over 6 years in patients \nrandomized to placebo, but not in those receiving pravastatin.32 We do not have accurate \ndetails of statin use in the current population, but in a similar cohort of patients \n 13\nundergoing all forms of cardiac surgery in our institution, post operative statin use was \n78%,33 rising to 87% in patients undergoing CABG (unpublished data). \n \nLeukocyte subtypes \nDespite the absence of an association between total WCC and outcome in this cohort, we \nfound lymphocyte and monocyte counts to be significant univariable predictors, with the \nneutrophil count demonstrating a trend towards significance. The improved survival \nassociated with a higher lymphocyte count was particularly striking. This has previously \nbeen observed in patients with stable coronary artery disease,22 those undergoing 'high-\nrisk' angioplasty14 and those with heart failure.21,34\n \nMore recently, it has been demonstrated that increased prognostic information could \nobtained by deriving the N\/L ratio. In a cohort of 3,227 patients undergoing coronary \nangiography, the N\/L ratio was a powerful predictor of mortality - and was independent \nand superior to individual leukocyte subtypes.23 After adjustment for other factors, \npatients with a N\/L ratio in the upper quartile had a 3 times higher hazard of death during \nfollow-up than those in the lowest quartile.23 Likewise, in 1,046 patients undergoing \npercutaneous coronary intervention, the pre-procedural N\/L ratio, but not the total WCC, \nwas an independent predictor of all-cause death.24 This was, however, a selected \npopulation, from which <25% of eligible patients had a differential leukocyte available - \nraising the possibility that unidentified clinical factors may have introduced bias. \n \n \n 14\nPotential mechanisms \nBoth an elevated neutrophil count and a depressed lymphocyte count are associated with \na worse outcome. It seems likely that the ability to integrate these two facets of the \ndifferential WCC underpins the particular prognostic utility of the N\/L ratio. A higher \nratio was associated with several major determinants of cardiovascular outcome. \nHowever, the observed increased hazard is independent of such factors. Analysis of the \nsurvival curves demonstrates that the excess mortality is concentrated in patients with the \nhighest ratio. The curves separate immediately and continue to diverge \u2013 suggesting an \nincreased risk both in the early post-operative period and in the longer term. \n \nMultiple properties of leukocytes may contribute to peri-operative myocardial damage \nand, thus, a worse outcome. Neutrophil infiltration is associated with secondary damage \nfollowing myocardial ischemia and is implicated in reperfusion injury - through both \ndirect toxic effects on the myocardium and vascular endothelium, and leukocyte plugging \nin the microvasculature15,17 In support of this, the use of a neutrophil and platelet depleted \nreperfusate has been associated with a reduction in post-operative myocardial damage.35 \nIncreased neutrophil counts are also associated with increased blood viscosity and \nhypercoagulability.17 Likewise, cardiopulmonary bypass itself is associated with \nneutrophil activation,36 which may accentuate the effects of elevated pre-operative levels. \n \nThe longer-term excess risk associated with an elevated N\/L ratio may, in part, reflect the \nconsequences of increased peri-operative myocardial injury. Certainly, peri-operative \nmyocardial damage is associated with long-term adverse outcome.33 It is likely that it also \n 15\ndue to other mechanisms. Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory process,2 and elevation of \nthe N\/L ratio may reflect a chronic background inflammatory state. Although neutrophils \nplay a limited role in atherogenesis they have a major role in the disruption of \natherosclerotic plaques \u2013 and, thereby, influence their progression and the risk of acute \ncomplications.15,17,19,23,37 Meanwhile, although lymphocytes are also involved in the \ndevelopment and progression of atherosclerosis,2 peripheral lymphopenia predicts a \npoorer outcome in patients with stable coronary heart disease.22 The reasons for this are \nnot fully understood. The most widely accepted explanation, however, is that a reduced \nlymphocyte count reflects a physiological stress.15,22 Thus, lymphopenia may serve as a \nsurrogate marker for the general health of an individual rather than reflecting a protective \nrole of lymphocytes per se. It appears, therefore, that the N\/L ratio integrates several \nparameters that will determine both the early and later outcome from CABG. \n \nStudy strengths and limitations \nThis study comprised a large cohort of consecutive patients undergoing non-urgent \nCABG in a regional cardiothoracic centre. The results are, therefore, representative of \nstable patients undergoing surgical revascularization. The use of all-cause mortality as a \nprimary end-point provides an objective measure of outcome. However, no data were \nobtained regarding other important morbidities such as peri-operative myocardial \ninfarction or stroke. Data are also lacking regarding pre and post-operative medication, \nwhich may have influenced the outcome of patients, and possibly the N\/L ratio itself. \n \n 16\nThe use of a single blood sample does not allow assessment of the stability of the N\/L \nratio in an individual over time and there is some diurnal variation in the differential \nleukocyte count, depending on glucocorticoid levels. Finally, some patients with minor \nsepsis may have been included in the study. Patients were, however, undergoing elective \nsurgery that would be re-scheduled if acute infection were suspected clinically. Likewise, \nsubgroup analysis of only patients with a normal WCC demonstrates similar results. \n \nDespite these limitations the current data demonstrate a clear relationship between pre-\noperative N\/L ratio and survival after CABG, with patients in the highest quartile at \ngreatest risk. Importantly, this prognostic utility is independent of other well-recognized \nindividual risk factors and the EuroSCORE. The N\/L ratio, which is easily calculated and \nreadily available, may, therefore, assist the risk-stratification of patients undergoing \nsurgical revascularization. It remains unclear whether elevation of the N\/L ratio directly \ncontributes to the observed poorer outcome and further work is required to clarify the \nunderlying mechanisms. \n 17\nREFERENCES \n1.
