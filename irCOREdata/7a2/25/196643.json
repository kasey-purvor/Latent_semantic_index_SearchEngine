Axial flow is seen to delay the onset of both\nconvective and absolute instabilities.\nI. Introduction\nThe rotating-disk boundary layer has long been used as a model for swept-wing flow because of the\nsimilarity between the basic-flow velocity profiles of the disk and the swept wing.1\u20133 For this reason research\ninto the stability of rotating 3D boundary-layer flows has been focused on the disk; very little theoretical\nwork had been published on the boundary-layer flows over rotating spheres and cones prior to 2002. However,\ncontinuing developments in spinning projectiles, aerofoils, aeroengines and other industrial applications has\nled to the need to understand the onset of laminar-turbulent transition of the boundary-layer flows over\nrotating disks, spheres and cones as objects in their own right.\nFor example, rotating spheres and cones are used as nose cones in aeroengine and spinning projectile\napplications. Here laminar-turbulent transition within the boundary-layer flow over the nose cones can\nlead to significant increases in drag. For aeroengine applications this has negative implications for the fuel\nefficiency through increased noise and energy dissipation, and for projectile applications this has negative\nimplications for control and accurate targeting. Understanding the stability of such boundary-layer flows and\ndeveloping strategies to maintain laminar flow will lead to modifications in the design of these applications\nand enable significant cost savings. Furthermore, flows arising from rotating disks are present in types of\nchemical vapour deposition (CVD) reactors used for depositing thin films of optical and electrical materials\non substrates in the electrochemical industry. Such reactors operate by forcing a carrier gas containing the\nreactive molecules onto the substrate held within a disk-like support placed horizontally in the flow. The\ngas flow can be considered as a uniform axial flow incident on a rotating disk and it is desirable that the\nflow close to the substrate be laminar and free from instability to ensure uniform deposition. Although a\nlarge amount of literature exists on the theoretical and experimental study of the reactor-flow parameters,4\u20136\nthese are concerned with the changes in the laminar-flow profiles that can be achieved and the affect these\nhave on deposition growth rates.\nAlthough numerous flow-visualization studies due to Kobayashi et al.7\u201317 and recent theoretical studies\ndue to Garrett & Peake18\u201322 have been published on the boundary-layer flows over rotating spheres and\ncones, a complete understanding of the stability characteristics of such boundary layers with regards to these\napplications is still a long way off. This current paper is part of a series by the present authors23,24 which\nconsiders the convective instability of the boundary-layer flow over a family of rotating cones (including the\n\u2217Presenting author.

The series presents complementing numerical and asymptotic studies and commenced\nwith an investigation into a family of cones rotating in an otherwise still fluid.23 This was then followed by\nan investigation into the disk rotating in an imposed axial flow.24 As we shall see in \u00a7II.A, the mathematical\nformulation of the rotating-disk problem in axial flow is necessarily different to that for the rotating cone in\naxial flow, and this motivates separate publication. This paper is different in structure to the previous two\ninvestigations in that it presents preliminary numerical results only; the asymptotic analysis is still in progress\nand will be published separately at a later date. In addition, this paper includes an investigation into the\nabsolute instability of the boundary-layer flow, which is associated with the onset of turbulence.18\u201322,25,26\nExperimental observations of the transition over rotating cones have noted a distinction between the\ntransition region on slender and broad cones. For example, experimental studies8 of cones with slender\nhalf-angles rotating in still fluid show the existence of pairs of counter-rotating Go\u00a8rtler-type vortices. These\narise from a dynamic instability induced by the centrifugal force of the flow field. However, as the half-\nangle is increased beyond \u03c8 = 30\u25e6, experimental results clearly show that the vortices change from pairs of\ncounter-rotating vortices to co-rotating crossflow vortices as observed on rotating disks and spheres. The\nobserved instability for slender cones therefore stems from an inherently different process. Indeed, Garrett\net al.23 hypothesize the existence of a viscous-mode dominated structure for slender cones (\u03c8 \u2264 40\u25e6) which\nleads to the onset of a centrifugal Go\u00a8rtler instability that is more dangerous than the usual type I and type\nII modes.\nFurther evidence for different stability characteristics of slender and broad rotating cones is obtained\nfrom the recent experimental measurements for the onset of turbulence in otherwise still fluid by Nickels\n(personal communication, 2007). The theoretical prediction for the onset of absolute instability due to\nGarrett & Peake21 is independent of half-angle and occurs at local Reynolds number R \u2248 2.5\u00d7105. Figure 1\nshows Nickels\u2019 results and we see that the onset of turbulence for the non-slender cone (\u03c8 = 60\u25e6) is in good\nagreement with the predicted onset of absolute instability and is independent of rotation rate. However, the\nonset of turbulence for slender cones (\u03c8 = 30\u25e6 & 15\u25e6) is well in advance of the predicted onset of absolute\ninstability and dependent on the rotation rate. This observation clearly demonstrates that transition on\nslender cones is inconsistent with the onset of absolute instability. Indeed, Nickels notes different behaviour\nin the turbulent intensity through transition in the case of the most slender cone which suggests a significantly\ndifferent transition mechanism.\nFigure 1. Experimental data due to Nickels for the onset of turbulence on rotating cones, uppermost plot is \u03c8 = 60\u25e6.\n(Cone angle = 2\u03c8)\nThis paper focuses on the impact of axial flow on the stability of the boundary layers over broad rotating\ncones (\u03c8 > 40\u25e6). An investigation into the hypothesized Go\u00a8rtler modes is underway and will be published\nat a later date.\nWith regards to similar theoretical studies, Kobayashi et al.15,16 use local-linear stability theory to\npredict the onset of spiral vortices in the boundary-layer flows over cones rotating in a uniform axial flow.\n2 of 15\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\nBoth papers consider a cone with a half-angle of 15\u25e6 and predict the critical Reynolds number for the onset\nof the vortices, the vortex angle and the number of vortices as a function of an axial-flow parameter. The\npredictions are found to be qualitatively consistent with experimental measurements.16,17 However, it is now\nclear that the transition mechanisms for slender cones are different for broad cones, which would explain\nwhy quantitative agreement was not obtained using their formulation.\nSection IV of this paper is related to Garrett & Peake\u2019s21 work on the absolute instability of the rotating-\ncone boundary layer in axial flow. The formulation of the laminar-flow profiles presented in this paper have\nbeen considerably improved and now lead to more physically relevant flows. The absolute instability results\ncontained here should therefore be considered as replacing those due to Garrett & Peake, although their\nresults for the cone rotating in an otherwise still fluid remain unchanged.\nII. Formulation\nII.A. Basic flow\nConsider a rigid cone of circular cross-section and half-angle \u03c8 that is rotating about its axis of symmetry\nwith angular velocity \u2126\u22c6. Note that an asterisk denotes a dimensional quantity in all that follows. The\ncone is placed in a fluid with an oncoming axial flow parallel to its axis of rotation. We choose the fixed\northogonal curvilinear coordinate system (x\u22c6, \u03b8, z\u22c6) representing streamwise, azimuthal and surface-normal\nvariation respectively, with the origin located at the apex of the cone. A diagram can be found in Figure 1\nof Garrett & Peake.21 The local cross-sectional radius of the cone is r\u22c6\n\u25e6\n= x\u22c6 sin\u03c8.\nAn appropriate coordinate transformation leads to the full Navier\u2013Stokes equations in the coordinate\nsystem\n\u2202U\u22c6\n\u2202x\u22c6\n+\nU\u22c6 sin\u03c8\nh\u22c6\n+\n1\nh\u22c6\n\u2202V \u22c6\n\u2202\u03b8\n+\n\u2202W \u22c6\n\u2202z\u22c6\n+\nW \u22c6 cos\u03c8\nh\u22c6\n= 0, (1)\n\u2202U\u22c6\n\u2202t\u22c6\n+U\u22c6\n\u2202U\u22c6\n\u2202x\u22c6\n+\nV \u22c6\nh\u22c6\n\u2202U\u22c6\n\u2202\u03b8\n+W \u22c6\n\u2202U\u22c6\n\u2202z\u22c6\n\u2212\nV \u22c62 sin\u03c8\nh\u22c6\n=\n\u2212\n1\n\u03c1\u22c6\n\u2202P \u22c6\n\u2202x\u22c6\n+ \u03bd\u22c6\n(\n\u22072U\u22c6 \u2212\n2 sin\u03c8\nh\u22c62\n\u2202V \u22c6\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2212\nsin\u03c8\nh\u22c62\n(U\u22c6 sin\u03c8 +W \u22c6 cos\u03c8)\n)\n, (2)\n\u2202V \u22c6\n\u2202t\u22c6\n+U\u22c6\n\u2202V \u22c6\n\u2202x\u22c6\n+\nV \u22c6\nh\u22c6\n\u2202V \u22c6\n\u2202\u03b8\n+W \u22c6\n\u2202V \u22c6\n\u2202z\u22c6\n+\nV \u22c6\nh\u22c6\n(U\u22c6 sin\u03c8 +W \u22c6 cos\u03c8) =\n\u2212\n1\nh\u22c6\u03c1\u22c6\n\u2202P \u22c6\n\u2202\u03b8\n+ \u03bd\u22c6\n(\n\u22072V \u22c6 +\n2\nh\u22c62\n(\nsin\u03c8\n\u2202U\u22c6\n\u2202\u03b8\n+ cos\u03c8\n\u2202W \u22c6\n\u2202\u03b8\n)\n\u2212\nV \u22c6\nh\u22c62\n)\n, (3)\n\u2202W \u22c6\n\u2202t\u22c6\n+U\u22c6\n\u2202W \u22c6\n\u2202x\u22c6\n+\nV \u22c6\nh\u22c6\n\u2202W \u22c6\n\u2202\u03b8\n+W \u22c6\n\u2202W \u22c6\n\u2202z\u22c6\n\u2212\nV \u22c62 cos\u03c8\nh\u22c6\n=\n\u2212\n1\n\u03c1\u22c6\n\u2202P \u22c6\n\u2202z\u22c6\n+ \u03bd\u22c6\n(\n\u22072W \u22c6 \u2212\n2 cos\u03c8\nh\u22c62\n\u2202V \u22c6\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2212\ncos\u03c8\nh\u22c62\n(U\u22c6 sin\u03c8 +W \u22c6 cos\u03c8)\n)\n, (4)\nwhere\n\u2207\u22c62 =\n\u22022\n\u2202x\u22c62\n+\n1\nh\u22c62\n\u22022\n\u2202\u03b8\u22c6\n+\n\u2202\n\u2202z\u22c62\n+\nsin\u03c8\nh\u22c6\n\u2202\n\u2202x\u22c6\n+\ncos\u03c8\nh\u22c6\n\u2202\n\u2202z\u22c6\n,\nis the Lapacian operator and h\u22c6 = x\u22c6 sin\u03c8 + z\u22c6 cos\u03c8. Note that U = (U\u22c6, V \u22c6,W \u22c6) is the velocity flow field\nand P \u22c6 the fluid pressure.\nAt the edge of the boundary layer the dimensional surface velocity distribution (i.e. the slip velocity) along\nthe cone, U\u22c6\n\u25e6\n(x\u22c6), is given by the well-known potential-flow solution discussed by, for instance, Rosenhead27\nand Evans.28 It takes the power-law form\nU\u22c6\n\u25e6\n(x\u22c6) = C\u22c6x\u22c6m.\nThe value of the parameter m is related to the cone half-angle (for instance, m = 1 when \u03c8 = 90\u25e6 and\nm = 0.1 when \u03c8 = 27.72\u25e6), and C\u22c6 is a scale factor determined by the free-stream axial flow incident on the\n3 of 15\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\nrotating cone. This inviscid solution is a good representation of the real slip velocity, since the separated\nboundary layer from the cone will tend to run parallel to the cone surface.\nThe appropriate boundary conditions are given by the slip and no-slip conditions at the edge of the\nboundary layer and the cone surface, respectively. These are represented as\nU\u22c6 = 0, V \u22c6 = x\u22c6\u2126\u22c6 sin\u03c8, W \u22c6 = 0 on z\u22c6 = 0,\nU\u22c6 \u2192 U\u22c6\n\u25e6\n(x\u22c6), V \u22c6 \u2192 0 as z\u22c6 \u2192\u221e.\nThe local axial-flow parameter Ts is defined as\nTs =\nC\u22c6x\u22c6m\nx\u22c6\u2126\u22c6 sin\u03c8\n,\nand is the ratio of the local slip velocity at x\u22c6 to the rotational speed of the cone surface at that location. It\nis important to note that in the case of m 6= 1 (i.e. \u03c8 6= 90\u25e6), Ts is dependent on the streamwise coordinate.\nIn effect this causes the solution originally proposed by Garrett & Peake21 to break down, as the equations\ngoverning the mean-flow are a system of partial differential equations in terms of the normal and streamwise\ncoordinates. For this reason we appeal to a different method of solution which is similar to that used by\nKoh & Price.29 We make a similarity-type transformation yielding the boundary-layer equations in terms\nof the governing stream-function. This is achieved by making a Mangler transformation on the governing\nequations. Suppose we define a new set of streamwise and surface-normal coordinates x\u00af\u22c6 and z\u00af\u22c6 respectively,\nand corresponding velocities U\u00af\u22c6, V\u00af \u22c6 and W\u00af \u22c6 given by\nx\u00af\u22c6 =\n1\nl\u22c62\n\u222b x\u22c6\n0\nr\u22c62\n\u25e6\ndx\u22c6, z\u00af\u22c6 =\nr\u22c6\n\u25e6\nl\u22c6\nz\u22c6,\nU\u00af\u22c6 = U\u22c6, V\u00af \u22c6 = V \u22c6, W\u00af \u22c6 =\nl\u22c6\nr\u22c6\n\u25e6\n(\nW \u22c6 +\n1\nr\u22c6\n\u25e6\ndr\u22c6\n\u25e6\ndx\u22c6\nz\u22c6U\u22c6\n)\n, (5)\nwhere l\u22c6 is a typical length scale in the streamwise direction. The resulting boundary-layer equations may\nbe derived in dimensional form using equations (1)\u2013(4) and transformation (5), which leads to\n\u2202U\u00af\u22c6\n\u2202x\u00af\u22c6\n+\n\u2202W\u00af \u22c6\n\u2202z\u00af\u22c6\n=0, (6)\nU\u00af\u22c6\n\u2202U\u00af\u22c6\n\u2202x\u00af\u22c6\n+ W\u00af \u22c6\n\u2202U\u00af\u22c6\n\u2202z\u00af\u22c6\n\u2212\nV\u00af \u22c62\n3x\u00af\u22c6\n=U\u00af\u22c6e\n\u2202U\u00af\u22c6e\n\u2202x\u00af\u22c6\n+ \u03bd\u22c6\n\u22022U\u00af\u22c6\n\u2202z\u00af\u22c62\n, (7)\nU\u00af\u22c6\n\u2202V\u00af \u22c6\n\u2202x\u00af\u22c6\n+ W\u00af \u22c6\n\u2202V\u00af \u22c6\n\u2202z\u00af\u22c6\n+\nU\u00af\u22c6V\u00af \u22c6\n3x\u00af\u22c6\n=\u03bd\u22c6\n\u2202V\u00af \u22c6\n\u2202z\u00af\u22c62\n, (8)\nwhere U\u00af\u22c6e (x\u00af\n\u22c6) = U\u22c6\n\u25e6\n(x\u22c6) = C\u22c6x\u22c6m.

(10)\nNote that a prime denotes differentiation with respect to \u03b71. Equations (9)\u2013(10) are subject the non-\ndimensional boundary conditions\nf = 0, f \u2032 = 0, g = 1 on \u03b71 = 0,\nf \u2032 \u2192 1, g \u2192 0 as \u03b71 \u2192\u221e. (11)\nIn order to solve the system of equations numerically, we decompose them into a fifth-order system of\nfirst-order PDEs. Solutions for s = 0 are obtained using a fourth-order Runge\u2013Kutta integration method\nwith a Newton\u2013Raphson searching routine to iterate on the boundary conditions at infinity. These initial\nprofiles are then integrated for non-zero s to obtain profiles for varying \u03b71 and s using the commercial NAG\nroutine D03DEF. The same routine has previously been used by Garrett & Peake18\u201320 to obtain the basic\nflow over the rotating sphere both with and without an imposed axial flow.\nConvective and absolute instability are local concepts and the analyses presented later will require the\nimpulse response of the system to be determined within a parallel-flow-type approximation at a location\nx\u22c6 = x\u22c6s along the surface of the cone. It is therefore appropriate to scale the steady velocities using the\nlocal-surface velocity, x\u22c6s\u2126\n\u22c6 sin\u03c8, as\nU(\u03b7;xs, \u03c8) =\nU\u22c6\nx\u22c6s\u2126\n\u22c6 sin\u03c8\n, V (\u03b7;xs, \u03c8) =\nV \u22c6\nx\u22c6s\u2126\n\u22c6 sin\u03c8\n, W (\u03b7;xs, \u03c8) =\nW \u22c6\n(\u03bd\u22c6\u2126\u22c6)1\/2\n,\nwhere \u03b7 = z\u22c6\/\u03b4\u22c6 and xs = x\n\u22c6\ns\/\u03b4\n\u22c6 are the non-dimensional distances scaled on the boundary-layer thickness\n\u03b4\u22c6 = (\u03bd\u22c6\/\u2126\u22c6)1\/2. This is consistent with the numerical stability analyses presented in the literature.18\u201321,23,24\nUsing this non-dimensionalization we note that\nU = s\u22121\/2\n\u2202f\n\u2202\u03b71\n(\u03b71, s), V = g(\u03b71, s),\nwhich are expressible in terms of the non-transformed normal coordinate \u03b7 using the following coordinate\nstretching for a fixed axial-flow parameter s\n\u03b71 = \u03b7\n(\nm+ 3\n2s1\/2\nsin\u03c8\n)1\/2\n.\nFigure 2 shows the resulting U - and V -components of the steady flow for a variety of values of s. We note\nthat these differ from those computed in Garrett & Peake\u2019s previous absolute instability analysis, but are\nconsidered to be more accurate. We see that as s increases the rotational effect dominates over the oncoming\naxial flow and the streamwise profiles show an inflectional nature, overshooting before converging to the\ninviscid solution at the edge of the boundary layer.\n5 of 15\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\u22120.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nU\n\u03b7\n\u22120.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nV\n\u03b7\nFigure 2.

The quantities \u03b1 and \u03b3 are in general complex, as\nrequired by the spatio-temporal analysis presented later. In contrast, in order to enforce periodicity round\nthe cone, n = \u03b2RL (identified as the number of vortices) must be interpreted at real integer values only.\nNote that these perturbing quantities are slightly different to those used by Garrett & Peake through the\nremoval of a factor of sin\u03c8 multiplying \u03b1. This is a minor adjustment and makes the formulation consistent\nwith the more recent studies23,24 by the present authors.\nSubstitution of the perturbing quantities into the general form of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations (1)\u2013(4)\nand non-dimensionalizing leads to the linear perturbation equations.

Equations\n(12)\u2013(17) reduce to Lingwood\u2019s25 perturbation equations for the rotating disk (in an appropriate frame of\nreference) when \u03c8 = 90\u25e6 and the basic-flow components are given by von Ka\u00b4rma\u00b4n\u2019s similarity solution. The\nperturbation equations differ from those stated by Garrett & Peake21 due to the different definition of \u03b1 and\nthe acknowledgment that the basic-flow components are functions of both \u03b7 and x.\nIn this preliminary investigation we present a study of the Orr\u2013Sommerfeld (OS) equation for the cone\nrotating in imposed axial flows. The governing fourth-order perturbation equation is obtained by neglecting\nstreamline-curvature effects in the full perturbation equations above. This leads to[\ni\n(\nD2 \u2212 k2\n)2\n+RL (\u03b1U + \u03b2V \u2212 \u03b3)\n(\nD2 \u2212 \u03b32\n)\n\u2212RL\n(\n\u03b1D2U + \u03b2D2V\n)]\n\u03c63 = 0, (18)\nwhere k2 = \u03b12 + \u03b22 is the effective wavenumber of the disturbance.\nAnalysis of the OS equation greatly simplifies the investigation as it removes the requirement for the nor-\nmal velocity component W and derivatives with respect to the streamwise direction. Previous studies18,25,31\nhave shown that although the predicted onset of instability is underestimated and the relative importance of\nthe streamline-curvature mode (type II) is unable to be predicted, analysis of the Orr\u2013Sommerfeld equation\nleads to qualitatively correct predictions which increase in numerical accuracy as RL \u2192 \u221e. This is further\ndiscussed in \u00a7III.\nEquations (12)\u2013(17) use a parallel-flow-type approximation in which we ignore variation in the local\nReynolds number RL with local surface cross-sectional radius and assume that \u03b7\/r\u25e6 << 1. This involves\nreplacing the variable r\u25e6 + \u03b7 cos\u03c8, which appears in the coefficients of the perturbation equations, by RL.\nThe resulting stability results are then strictly local, with location RL = r\u25e6,s appearing as a parameter.\nThe assumption RL >> 1 (equivalent to \u03b4\n\u22c6 << x\u22c6) necessarily prohibits analysis close to the apex where\nRL = O(1). The implications of this approximation are discussed in \u00a7V.\nIII. Convective instability\nIn this section we solve the eigenvalue problem defined by the OS equation (18), with the homogeneous\nboundary conditions\n\u03c6i = 0, \u03b7 = 0,\n\u03c6i \u2192 0, \u03b7 \u2192\u221e,\n(19)\n7 of 15\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\nwhere i = 1, 2 . . . 4. This eigenvalue problem will be solved for certain combinations of values of \u03b1, \u03b2 and\n\u03b3 at each Reynolds number, RL for a particular half-angle. From these we form the dispersion relation,\nD(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3;RL, \u03c8) = 0, with the aim of studying the occurrence of convective instabilities. This allows a\ndiscussion of the spatial branches of the dispersion relation before we study their pinching in the absolute\ninstability analysis of \u00a7IV. In each analysis the branches were calculated using a fourth-order Runge\u2013Kutta\nintegrator with Gram\u2013Schmidt orthonormalization and a Newton\u2013Raphson linear search procedure.\nSince we are supposing here that the flow is not absolutely unstable it follows that in the Briggs\u2013Bers\nprocedure we can reduce the imaginary part of the frequency down to zero, so that \u03b3i = 0. To produce\nthe neutral curves for convective instability a number of approaches can be taken in this stationary frame\nof reference. One approach is to insist that the vortices rotate at some fixed multiple of the cone surface\nvelocity, thereby fixing the ratio \u03b3r\/\u03b2, and then \u03b1 and \u03b2 are calculated using a spatial analysis. This is\nthe approach taken here. In particular, we explicitly assume that the vortices rotate with the surface of the\ncone (i.e. are stationary) so that \u03b3i = \u03b2, which is consistent with experimental observations discussed in \u00a7I.\nAs discussed by Corke & Knasiak,30 traveling modes can dominate on a highly polished rotating disk and\nthis is also likely to be the case over a highly polished broad rotating cone. However, we are particularly\ninterested in practical engineering applications where highly polished surfaces will not be found.\nIII.A. Cone rotating in otherwise still fluid and disk rotating in axial flow\nIn publication23 the present authors give the convective instability analysis for a family of cones rotating\nin an otherwise still fluid. An appropriate version of the full system of perturbation equations (12)\u2013(17) is\nused, and both numerical and asymptotic approaches are taken. Furthermore the equivalent analysis for a\ndisk placed in an enforced axial flow is contained in publication.24 The interested reader is therefore referred\nto those publications in the limiting cases of s \u2192 \u221e for all \u03c8 and \u03c8 = 90\u25e6 for all s. We now proceed to\npresent an analysis for non-zero axial flow incident on rotating cones (i.e. finite s and \u03c8 6= 90\u25e6.)\nIII.B. Cone rotating in uniform axial flow\nOne spatial branch was found to determine the convective instability characteristics in the OS analysis for\neach half-angle considered for each axial-flow rate. This branch arises from the crossflow (type I) instability\nmode and is identical to that discussed in related publications.19,20,31 It is known that this mode arises\nfrom the inflectional nature of the streamwise mean velocity component U . Previous investigations of related\nboundary layers have also noted the appearance of a streamline curvature (type II) instability mode. This\ncorresponds to a centrifugal instability associated with the way in which the outer-flow streamlines are curved\nby an O\n(\nR\u22121L\n)\namount close to the outer edge of the boundary layer. However, since streamline-curvature\neffects have been removed in this preliminary investigation of the OS equation, the type II mode does not\narise.\nFigure 3 shows the neutral curves in the (RL, \u03b1r)-, (RL, \u03b2)-, (RL, k\u03b4)- and (RL, \u01eb)-planes for \u03c8 = 70\n\u25e6\nfor a variety of values of s. Note that k\u03b4 =\n\u221a\n\u03b12 + \u03b22\/ sin\u03c8 is the modified wavenumber and \u01eb =\narctan(\u03b2 sin\u03c8\/\u03b1r) is the modified waveangle of the disturbances. Although the introduction of the fac-\ntor sin\u03c8 appears arbitrary here, it arises from the formulation of the asymptotic study (not presented here)\nand enables comparison with the previous numerical and asymptotic investigations23,24 (the interested reader\nis referred to those publications for more details). The neutral curves are determined by setting \u03b3i = 0 (i.e.\na neutral disturbance) and \u03b3r = \u03b2 (i.e. to guarantee stationary disturbances) and for each RL the dispersion\nrelation is then solved to return a pair of values (\u03b1r, \u03b2) for each neutral mode. As can be seen in Figure\n3, the value of \u03b2 varies continuously, although of course only values of \u03b2 are allowed such that n is integer.\nInside each loop of the neutral curves the flow is convectively unstable.\nFigure 3 clearly demonstrates that axial flow has a stabilizing effect on the rotating-cone boundary layer\nby increasing the critical Reynolds number for the onset of instability. It is also clear that the range of\nwaveangles that the spiral vortices are predicted to exist is narrowed with increased axial flow. Table 1 lists\nthe critical values of RL, xL = RL\/ sin\u03c8, vortex angle and number of vortices at the onset of convective\ninstability at each axial flow rate and half-angle studied using the Orr\u2013Sommerfeld formulation.\nUnfortunately experimental results9,17 for rotating cones in axial flow exist only for \u03c8 = 15\u25e6. It is\ntherefore possible to compare our calculations for \u03c8 = 70\u25e6 and 50\u25e6 only qualitatively with these studies.\nAgreement is found with the general trend that axial flow delays the onset of spiral vortices and increases\ntheir waveangle.\n8 of 15\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n102 103 104 105\n10\u22122\n100\n\u03b1\nRL\n102 103 104 105\n10\u22122\n100\n\u03b2\nRL\n102 103 104 105\n10\u22122\n100\nRL\nk \u03b4\n102 103 104 105\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\nRL\n\u03b5\nFigure 3. Orr\u2013Sommerfeld neutral curves for convective instability of stationary vortices for \u03c8 = 70\u25e6 with s =\n\u221e, 400, 25, 10 & 5, arrow indicates direction of decreasing s (i.e. increasing axial flow).\nIn order to compare the onset of convective instability at each s between both values of \u03c8, it is sensible\nto use xL = RL\/ sin\u03c8 (the non-dimensional distance along the cone surface). Table 1 shows that the onset\nof convective instability occurs further along the 50\u25e6-cone than the 70\u25e6-cone for each value of Ts. However,\nit is clear from the definition of the axial-flow parameter that equal values of Ts for both values of \u03c8 does not\ntranslate as equal incident axial-flow rates. This is due to the appearance of m which depends on \u03c8. Care\nmust therefore be taken in making such comparisons. The interpretation of such comparisons is discussed\nfurther by Garrett18 and Garrett & Peake.21 We are able to conclude that the critical values of the 50\u25e6-cone\nappear to more sensitive to the values of Ts than the 70\n\u25e6-cone.\nIn order to discuss the relative importance of the type I and type II modes of instability it is necessary\nto consider the full perturbation system of equations (12)\u2013(17), which is not done here. For the related\nboundary-layer flows over rotating spheres and disks, Garrett & Peake20 and the present authors23 find that\nincreased axial flow increases the importance of the type II (streamline curvature) mode until it becomes\nthe most dangerous below a certain value of s. The suggestion that increased axial flow would emphasize\nthe streamline-curvature mode is also sensible in this geometry. In particular, Figure 2 shows that axial flow\nincreases the amount of fluid entrained into the boundary layer, which would clearly lead to more streamline\ncurvature. It is also expected that this will occur on rotating cones of other half angles. Physically, it\nis suggested that axial flow effectively sweeps any instabilities arising from, say, surface roughness further\ndownstream, causing the location of transition to retreat downstream also. Therefore axial flow has a\nstabilizing effect on convective instabilities.\nFigure 4 demonstrates the implications of using the OS equation (18) instead of the full perturbation\nequations (12)\u2013(17) for a cone with \u03c8 = 70\u25e6 rotating in an otherwise still fluid. This is done by plotting\nneutral curves as in Figure 3, but calculated from each system of equations. In each plot we see a marked\ndifference in the behaviour close to the critical value of RL, most notably in that the two-lobed structure\ndoes not exist in the OS analysis, but also that the critical values of RL are lower in the OS analysis. As\nRL increases, excellent agreement is obtained in the upper-branch calculations in the (RL, \u03b1r)-, (RL, \u03b2)-\nand (RL, k\u03b4)-planes and good agreement is obtained in the lower branches.

Critical parameters at the onset of convective instability for a range of axial-flow rates.\nagreement is obtained in the lower branch (which corresponds to the upper branch of the other plots) but the\ndiscrepancy in the predicted upper-branch waveangle is more noticeable (although this is partly to do with\nthe log-scalings used in the other plots). The waveangle and wavenumber plots also show the comparison\nwith the asymptotic predictions. Figure 4 therefore demonstrates that the results from this preliminary OS-\nanalysis are expected to be quantitatively close to those arising from the full system. However, the relative\nimportance of the type I and type II modes (as determined by the two lobed structure) cannot be investigated\nunder the OS formulation, as mentioned above.

Absolute instability\nWe now solve the OS eigenvalue problem with the aim of studying the occurrence of absolute instability.\nThe Briggs\u2013Bers method is used to detect an absolutely-unstable response to the initial perturbation of the\nform \u03b4(r\u2212rs)\u03b4(t)e\ni\u03b2\u03b8. For absolute instability to occur we need to locate a pinch point (\u03b1\u25e6, \u03b3\u25e6), formed by the\ncoalescence between two spatial branches which originate from distinct half-\u03b1-planes when \u03b3i is sufficiently\nlarge and positive. The flow is then absolutely unstable if \u03b3i > 0 at the pinch point, and is otherwise at\nworst convectively unstable.\nA pinch point has indeed been found for each half-angle \u03c8 and flow parameter s, which is unstable for\nsufficiently large RL. The pinch for a particular set of parameter values is shown in Figure 5 where the\ncharacteristic exchange of branches can be seen. This pinching behaviour is consistent with that previously\nfound on related geometries.18\u201322,25,26 By monitoring the behaviour of the two spatial branches as the\nReynolds number is varied, it is possible to determine the critical value of RL for the onset of absolute\ninstability. As Lingwood25 and Garrett & Peake19,20 have demonstrated with previous analyses of the\nOS\/full system of perturbation equations, the pinch is formed by the coalescence of two branches which are\ninviscid in origin. One is the convectively unstable type I branch and the other is a convectively stable branch\n(typically denoted type III). Existence of a pinch in this current OS analysis would therefore demonstrate\nthat the rotating-cone boundary layer is absolutely unstable in axial flow, although the predicted onset\nwill be quantitatively different to that predicted by the more accurate full-perturbation system. As with\nthe convective instability case, the extent of the discrepancy can be judged by plotting neutral curves for\nabsolute instability for a cone rotating in otherwise still fluid. Figure 6 demonstrates the implications of\nusing the OS equation (18) instead of the full perturbation equations (12)\u2013(17) for a cone with \u03c8 = 70\u25e6\nrotating in an otherwise still fluid in terms of the (RL, \u03b1r)-, (RL, \u03b1i)-, (RL, \u03b2)- and (RL, \u03b3r)-planes.\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.2\n0\n0.2\n\u03b1\nr\n\u03b1\ni\nFigure 5.

Cone rotating in otherwise still fluid and disk rotating in axial flow\nGarrett & Peake21 give the results of absolute-instability analyses for a family of cones rotating in a range\nof axial flows. They use the full system of perturbation equations. As discussed above, this current paper\nuses more accurate basic-flow profiles for non-zero axial flow imposed on rotating cones and so the results\nare intended to replace those previously published. However, the basic flows obtained using the methods\ndetailed in \u00a7II.A are identical to those obtained previously for zero axial flow (Ts = 0, s\u2192\u221e) for all \u03c8 and\nfor Ts 6= 0 when \u03c8 = 90\n\u25e6.

The most striking feature of this figure is\nthe sensitivity of absolute instability to axial flow. For example, the onset of convective instability is delayed\nfrom RL \u2248 176 to 289 as the imposed axial flow is increased from s =\u221e (Ts = 0) to s = 400 (Ts = 0.05); this\nrepresents an increase of around 60%. However, the onset of absolute instability is increased from RL \u2248 407\nto 2279 over the same range of s; this is an increase of around 460%. For this reason the figure shows the\nneutral curves over a much shorter range of axial-flow parameters.\nTable 2 lists the critical values of RL and xL for the onset of absolute instability at each axial flow rate\nand half-angle studied using the Orr\u2013Sommerfeld formulation.

As with \u03c8 = 70\u25e6, the onset of absolute instability over the 50\u25e6-cone is seen to be very sensitive\nto axial flow. As with the onset of convective instability, the delayed onset of absolute instability with Ts\nfor \u03c8 = 50\u25e6 is more sensitive than for \u03c8 = 70\u25e6.\nV. Conclusion\nIn this paper we have used an Orr\u2013Sommerfeld analysis to show that the boundary layer over a broad\ncone (\u03c8 > 40\u25e6) rotating in an imposed axial flow is both convectively and absolutely unstable. The onset\nof both instabilities are delayed with increased Ts (i.e. decreased s) and the critical position for onset (as\nmeasured along the surface of the cone) is delayed with decreased \u03c8.\nWe have made use of a parallel-flow-type approximation by assuming that factors 1 + \u03b7 cos\u03c8\/RL can\nbe replaced by unity. We are careful to point out that this approximation would imply that the resulting\nperturbation equations are not consistent to O\n(\nR\u22121L\n)\n, the same order as the viscous and streamline curva-\nture effects. Therefore, whether using the Orr\u2013Sommerfeld equation (18) or the full perturbation equations\n(12)\u2013(17), the solutions cannot be justified rigorously at finite RL.

Curves are shown for s = 10000, 1000, 400, 100 and 50 from left to right (i.e. increasing axial flow).\napproximation will not affect the conclusions presented here. In particular, studies into the convective insta-\nbility of related boundary layers by the present authors23,24 also use this approximation and all numerical\nresults are verified by rigorous asymptotic investigations at high RL. Furthermore, absolute instability is\nknown to arise from inviscid modes which are observable in the purely inviscid and rigorous analysis of the\nRayleigh equation obtained by neglected both streamline curvature and viscous terms from the full system of\nperturbation equations. However, we do acknowledge that the results presented here will be subject to quan-\ntitative inaccuracies as a result of the approximation. A full discussion of the impact of the approximation\nis intended for a future paper where the complementary asymptotic study will be presented.\nUnfortunately no experimental results for cones rotating in imposed axial flows are available for com-\nparison at half-angles greater than \u03c8 = 15\u25e6. This means that quantitative comparisons of both the onset\nof spiral vortices (against convective instability) and the onset of turbulence (against absolute instability)\ncannot be made. Compiling the numerical codes for \u03c8 = 15\u25e6 would not be useful as this investigation is\nformulated to study crossflow instabilities, rather than the hypothesized Go\u00a8rtler modes on slender cones.\nThe results of this paper are restricted to local-linear stability. The question of the global-linear stability\nof the rotating disk was first investigated by Davies & Carpenter,32 who use a numerical simulation to\ndemonstrate that the global mode associated with the local absolute instability is damped. This has also\nbeen theoretically verified in the preliminary study of Garrett & Peake22 for the boundary layers on disks and\ncones rotating in otherwise still fluids. It is therefore also likely to be case when axial flow is incident on the\nrotating cone. Note however that this does not imply that absolute instability is not involved in transition.\nIn order to see this one must include nonlinearity: Pier et al.33,34 have shown that a self-excited, nonlinear\nglobal mode will always exist in the presence of a region of local absolute instability. This is in contrast to\nlinear theory, since publications22,32 have demonstrated that the region of local absolute instability on the\ndisk is not sufficient to support an unstable linear global mode. Pier35 has further shown that this nonlinear\nglobal mode can undergo secondary instability very close to the convective-absolute boundary, providing a\npossible route to turbulence. The global behaviour needs to be investigated for the rotating-cone boundary\nlayer both with and without an imposed axial flow.\n13 of 15\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\u03c8 = 70\u25e6 \u03c8 = 50\u25e6\ns Ts RL xL RL xL\n\u221e 0 406.4 432.5 368.0 480.4\n10000 0.010 1792.9 1908.0 1669.4 2179.2\n1000 0.032 2033.9 2164.4 1891.2 2468.8\n400 0.050 2278.8 2425.0 2116.2 2762.5\n100 0.100 3180.5 3384.6 2947.3 3847.4\n50 0.141 4301.0 4577.0 3982.3 5198.5\n25 0.200 6882.5 7324.2 6372.4 8318.6\nTable 2. Critical parameters at the onset of absolute instability for a range of axial-flow rates.\nIn all papers in this series an incompressible boundary layer has been assumed and methods from linear-\nstability theory applied. Although the assumption of incompressibility is reasonable for many aeroengine\napplications, it is not for the high-speed aerodynamic and CVD applications discussed in \u00a7I. The investi-\ngations performed so far, although important in a theoretical context, must be considered as preliminary\ninvestigations with regards to such applications. Further work is therefore intended to study the effects of\ncompressibility on the instability modes discussed. Work is also underway to clarify the transition mecha-\nnisms on slender cones.\nAcknowledgments\nSJG wishes to acknowledge study leave granted by the University of Leicester.
