We propose that these repetitive elements have played a role in\nthe fragmentation of the mouse \u0001 cluster during evolution.\n[Supplemental material is available online at www.genome.org. The sequence data from this study have been\nsubmitted to GenBank\/EMBL under accession no. AY016022.]\nGenome sequencing projects and comparative genome analyses\nprovide powerful tools to gain information on various aspects of\ngene function and regulation (Hardison and Miller 1993). Mul-\ntiple alignments of large genomic segments containing genes\nwith evolutionarily conserved patterns of expression have iden-\ntified potential regulatory elements that have been maintained\nfollowing speciation (see, e.g., Hardison et al. 1997; Oeltjen et al.\n1997; Gottgens et al. 2000; Flint et al. 2001; Waterston et al.\n2002). Such analyses have also proven to be valuable by increas-\ning our understanding of the mechanisms underlying genome\nevolution (Hardison 2000).\nThe erythroid-specific \u0001-globin gene cluster represents one\nof the best-characterized models for studying mammalian gene\nregulation and genome evolution. We have previously compared\nlong-range sequences of the \u0001-globin gene clusters from human,\nmouse, chicken, and pufferfish and identified a well-defined\nchromosomal unit of conserved synteny that may contain all the\ncis-acting sequences required for full regulation of \u0001-globin gene\nexpression (Flint et al. 1997, 2001; Daniels et al. 2001). This re-\ngion of conserved synteny spans \u223c112 kb of the mouse \u0001-globin\ncluster and the surrounding sequences, including all known\nlong-range regulatory elements and several ubiquitously ex-\npressed genes lying on the telomeric side of the human \u0001-globin\ngenes (Fig. 1; Flint et al. 2001).\nThe 5\u0001 break in synteny lies at least 126 kb upstream of the\nhuman \u0001 cluster corresponding to a region \u223c87 kb upstream of\nthe mouse \u0001 cluster. In both species, this breakpoint lies beyond\nthe IL9R gene, which is a functional gene in mouse but a pseu-\ndogene in human (Kermouni et al. 1995; Vermeesch et al. 1997).\nIn human, the IL9R pseudogene lies only 16 kb from the telo-\nmere of Chromosome 16 (Flint et al. 1997), whereas in mouse,\nthe entire \u0001 cluster lies at an interstitial chromosomal location\n(Leder et al. 1981, 1985; Tan and Whitney 1993). Therefore, as\npreviously described, the breakpoint in synteny between these\ntwo species is delimited by the initial position of the human 16p\nsubtelomeric region (Flint et al. 2001). It is of interest that\nwhereas in most mammalian species the \u0001 cluster appears to lie\nclose to a telomere, the \u0001 cluster in the rat, like mouse, also lies\nat an interstitial position (http:\/\/genome-test.cse.ucsc.edu\/; see\nbelow), suggesting that the transition from a telomeric to an\ninterstitial location may be a rearrangement that is specific to the\nrodent lineage. Beyond the IL9R gene, both mouse and rat se-\nquences are homologous to human Chromosome 5 (http:\/\/\ngenome-test.cse.ucsc.edu\/).\nAt the 3\u0001-end of the cluster, sequence conservation between\nhuman, mouse, chicken, and pufferfish is abruptly lost just\ndownstream from the \u0001 cluster, immediately centromeric to the\nHBQ1 (\u0002) gene on human Chromosome 16 (Flint et al. 2001).\nRemarkably, this synteny breakpoint lies close to the 3\u0001 limit of\nthe chromatin domain that becomes hyperacetylated in human\nand mouse erythroid cells (Anguita et al. 2001), adding further\nevidence that this region might represent the minimal chromo-\nsomal domain required to fully regulate the \u0001-globin genes. It has\ntherefore been of interest to characterize this region in some\ndetail. Unfortunately, this 3\u0001 break in synteny has been difficult\nto define precisely because the organization of the structural\n\u0001-globin genes within the cluster differs between mouse and hu-\nman such that the sequence conservation within and down-\nstream from the \u0001-globin gene cluster is limited to the exons of\nthe structural genes.\n6Present address: Department of Genetics, University of Leicester,\nLeicester LE1 7RH, UK.\n7Corresponding author.\nE-MAIL doug.higgs@imm.ox.ac.uk; FAX 44 1865 222 500.\nArticle and publication are at http:\/\/www.genome.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1101\/\ngr.2143604.\nLetter\n14:623\u2013630 \u00a92004 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press ISSN 1088-9051\/04; www.genome.org Genome Research 623\nwww.genome.org\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on August 19, 2013 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nFi\ng\nu\nre\n1\nH\nom\nol\nog\ny\nre\nla\ntio\nns\nhi\np\nbe\ntw\nee\nn\nhu\nm\nan\n16\np\n13\n.3\nan\nd\nm\nou\nse\nC\nhr\nom\nos\nom\nes\n11\nan\nd\n17\n.A\nt\nth\ne\nto\np\nis\na\nsc\nhe\nm\nat\nic\nre\np\nre\nse\nnt\nat\nio\nn\nof\nth\ne\n16\np\n13\n.3\nte\nlo\nm\ner\ne.\nTh\ne\nov\nal\nre\np\nre\nse\nnt\ns\nth\ne\nte\nlo\nm\ner\nic\nre\np\nea\nts\n(T\nTA\nG\nG\nG\n) n\n.G\nen\nes\nar\ne\nsh\now\nn\nas\nbo\nxe\ns\nnu\nm\nbe\nre\nd\nas\nin\nFl\nin\nte\nta\nl.\n(1\n99\n7)\n.G\nen\nes\nab\nov\ne\nth\ne\nlin\ne\nar\ne\ntr\nan\nsc\nrib\ned\nto\nw\nar\nd\nth\ne\nce\nnt\nro\nm\ner\ne;\nth\nos\ne\nbe\nlo\nw\nth\ne\nlin\ne\nar\ne\ntr\nan\nsc\nrib\ned\nto\nw\nar\nd\nth\ne\nte\nlo\nm\ner\ne.\nEm\np\nty\nbo\nxe\ns\nid\nen\ntif\ny\np\nse\nud\nog\nen\nes\n.\nTh\ne\n\u0001\n-g\nlo\nbi\nn\nre\ngu\nla\nto\nry\nel\nem\nen\nt\n(H\nS-\n40\n)\nis\nsh\now\nn\nin\nda\nrk\ngr\nay\n.\nIn\nth\ne\nm\nid\ndl\ne\nis\nth\ne\nin\nte\nrs\ntit\nia\nlr\neg\nio\nn\nof\nm\nou\nse\nC\nhr\nom\nos\nom\ne\n11\nco\nnt\nai\nni\nng\nth\ne\n\u0001\n-g\nlo\nbi\nn\ncl\nus\nte\nr.\nG\nen\nes\nar\ne\nnu\nm\nbe\nre\nd\nin\nsi\nm\nila\nrit\ny\nto\nth\ne\nhu\nm\nan\nge\nne\ns.\nA\ntt\nhe\nbo\ntt\nom\nis\nth\ne\nre\ngi\non\nof\nm\nou\nse\nC\nhr\nom\nos\nom\ne\n17\nsp\nan\nni\nng\nth\ne\nm\nou\nse\nLU\nC\n7L\nho\nm\nol\nog\nan\nd\nth\ne\nH\nba\n-p\ns4\np\nse\nud\no-\n\u0001\nge\nne\n.T\nhe\nda\nsh\ned\nse\ngm\nen\nt\nof\nm\nLu\nc7\nL\nin\ndi\nca\nte\ns\nth\ne\nre\ngi\non\nth\nat\nha\ns\nno\nt\nye\nt\nbe\nen\nse\nq\nue\nnc\ned\n.T\nhe\nlig\nht\ngr\nay\nar\nea\nsh\now\ns\nth\ne\n8-\nkb\nin\nte\nrv\nal\nof\nth\ne\nhu\nm\nan\n16\np\n13\n.3\nse\nq\nue\nnc\ne\nw\nith\nin\nw\nhi\nch\nlie\nth\ne\nce\nnt\nro\nm\ner\nic\nsy\nnt\nen\ny\nbr\nea\nkp\noi\nnt\nan\nd\nth\ne\nce\nnt\nro\nm\ner\nic\nlim\nit\nof\nth\ne\nhu\nm\nan\n\u0001\n-g\nlo\nbi\nn\nre\ngu\nla\nto\nry\ndo\nm\nai\nn.\nTh\ne\nsy\nm\nbo\nl\nin\ndi\nca\nte\ns\nth\ne\ndi\nre\nct\nre\npe\nat\ns\nfo\nun\nd\nat\nth\ne\nsy\nnt\nen\ny\nbr\nea\nkp\noi\nnt\n.T\nhe\nm\nou\nse\nC\nhr\nom\nos\nom\ne\n17\nP1\ncl\non\nes\n33\nL1\n0\nan\nd\n17\nN\n8\nar\ne\nsh\now\nn.\nTufarell i et al.\n624 Genome Research\nwww.genome.org\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on August 19, 2013 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nRecently, this analysis becamemore tractable when we iden-\ntified the next gene lying centromeric to the human \u0001-globin\ncluster at 16p13.3 (LUC7L). This gene encodes a ubiquitous RNA-\nbinding protein component of the U1 snRNP complex, which\nsurprisingly maps to Chromosome 17 in the mouse, and is there-\nfore separated from the functional \u0001-globin gene cluster located\non Chromosome 11 (Fig. 1; Tufarelli et\nal. 2001). The region of human Chromo-\nsome 16p13.3 beyond LUC7L up to the\nmouse ortholog of the PKD1 gene (\u223c2\nMb) is also syntenic to mouse Chromo-\nsome 17 (Himmelbauer et al. 1992;\nObermayr et al. 1995; Olsson et al. 1995,\n1996; Daniels et al. 2001), indicating\nthat the 3\u0001 breakpoint where human\n16p13.3 switches in synteny between\nmouse Chromosomes 11 and 17 lies\nwithin the 8-kb segment separating the \u0002\nand LUC7L genes (Fig. 1; Tufarelli et al.\n2001).\nA clue to the mechanism underly-\ning this 11-to-17 translocation in mouse\nwas provided by finding some remnants\nof the mouse \u0001-like globin genes on\nChromosome 17. In addition to the ac-\ntive genes on Chromosome 11, two\npseudo-\u0001 genes, Hba-ps3 and Hba-ps4,\nhave been identified and assigned to\nmouse Chromosomes 15 and 17, respec-\ntively (Leder et al. 1980, 1981; Vanin et\nal. 1980). Hba-ps3 is a processed pseudo-\ngene, lacking the intervening sequences\n(Vanin et al. 1980), and might have\nmoved to Chromosome 15 by transposi-\ntion via an RNA intermediate (Leder et\nal. 1981). Hba-ps4 is an \u0001-globin gene\nhomolog having three exons and two in-\ntrons (Leder et al. 1981). The mouse\nLuc7L (mLuc7L) gene is so closely linked\nto Hba-ps4 that we identified two P1\nclones spanning both genes and encom-\npassing the breakpoint in synteny (Fig.\n1; Tufarelli et al. 2001). To define this\nlimit in more detail, we have now fully\nsequenced the P1 clone 33L10 from\nmouse Chromosome 17 including the\nHba-ps4 gene and the last six exons of\nmLuc7L (Fig. 1). Analysis of this se-\nquence and comparisons of the human\nChromosome 16, rat Chromosome 10,\nand mouse Chromosome 11 sequences\nhave allowed us to propose a mechanism\nby which Hba-ps4 and adjacent se-\nquences may have been translocated\nfrom mouse Chromosome 11 to Chro-\nmosome 17.\nRESULTS\nUsing an M13-based shotgun strategy\n(Wilson et al. 1994), we sequenced\n65,871 bp of the P1 clone 33L10 from\nmouse Chromosome 17, known to con-\ntain Hba-ps4 and the 3\u0001-end of mLuc7L\n(Fig. 1; Sutherland et al. 1995; Tufarelli\net al. 2001). Identification of the genes\nin this sequence was mainly performed by comparison with the\nhuman 16p13.3 (Fig. 2A) and mouse Chromosome 11 (Figs. 2B\nand 3A) sequences. In Figure 2A is shown a dot plot of the mouse\n33L10 sequence (coordinates 40 kb onward) against the human\n16p13.3 sequence (coordinates 160\u2013200 kb). This analysis reveals\nthe presence of exons 7\u201312 of mLuc7L (spanning coordinates\nFigure 2 Dot plots of the mouse Chromosome 17 sequence against the human Chromosome 16 (A)\nand mouse Chromosome 11 (B) sequences. (A) Alignment with repeats masked of human and mouse\nsequences showing the presence of three \u0001-like pseudogenes and of LUC7L exons 7\u201312 in the 33L10\nsequence (diagonals in the plot). Note that the three exons of Hba-ps4 match human \u00011 (HBA1) and\n\u00012 (HBA2), and, to a lesser extent, \u00021 (HBQ1); Hba-psm contains two exons more related to human \u00011\n(HBA1) than \u00012 (HBA2); Hba-q3 consists of one exon only that matches, although poorly, human \u00021\n(HBQ1). (B) Alignment of mouse 11 and 17 sequences with repeats not masked. Note that the\npseudo-\u0001 gene set on Chromosome 17 shows more extensive similarity to the 3\u0001 set on Chromosome\n11.

The transcriptional orientation of\nmLuc7L is opposite to that of Hba-ps4. This is the same orienta-\ntion as the LUC7L and \u0001-globin genes at human 16p13.3 (Fig. 1;\nFlint et al. 1997).\nUnexpectedly, the human\u2013mouse comparison revealed\nthat, in addition to Hba-ps4, which is similar to both human\nHBA1 (\u00011) and HBA2 (\u00012) genes, two additional \u0001-like globin\npseudogenes are present on either side of Hba-ps4 (Fig. 2A). The\ncomparison reveals two exons with higher similarity to the hu-\nman HBA2 globin gene upstream of Hba-ps4 (\u0003\u0001 or Hba-psm,\nspanning coordinates 44,293\u201344,742), and, downstream from\nHba-ps4, one exon with matches to the human HBQ1 (\u0002) gene (\u0003\u0002\nor Hba-q3, coordinates 48,724\u201348,735; Fig. 2A). This arrange-\nment is interesting because previous analysis of the mouse \u0001-glo-\nbin cluster suggested that during evolution there has been at least\none duplication of a similar set of three genes (\u0003\u0001\u2013\u0001\u2013\u0002) in the\nfunctional \u0001-globin cluster (Fig. 4). It therefore seems that Hba-\nps4 is part of a three-gene set (Hba-psm\u2013Hba-ps4\u2013Hba-q3) with a\nsimilar structure to the duplicated three-gene set on mouse Chro-\nmosome 11 (Hba-ps\u2013Hba-a\u2013Hba-q; Flint et al. 2001; R. Hardison\nand W. Miller, unpubl.). Comparison of mouse Chromosome 11\n(coordinates 115\u2013142 kb) and 17 (coordinates 30\u201350 kb) se-\nquences confirms the presence of the three-gene set as a promi-\nnent block of homology encompassing the pseudogene and\n\u0001-globin genes (Fig. 2B). This analysis reveals that the degree of\nconservation is higher with the Hba-ps2 and Hba-a2 genes on\nChromosome 11 (Fig. 2B). The dot plot shows that the homology\nblock extends for \u223c5 kb 5\u0001 to the Hba-ps2 on Chromosome 11,\nalmost to the 3\u0001-end of the Hba-q1 gene on Chromosome 11\n(Fig. 2B).\nThe gene set on Chromosome 17 has sustained insertions of\nan IAP (Intracisternal A Particle) element followed by an LTR\n(Long Terminal Repeat), and the \u0003\u0002 (Hba-q3) gene, representing a\n\u0002-like globin gene on Chromosome 17, has substantially diverged\nfrom its paralogs on Chromosome 11 (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the\nHba-psm\u2013Hba-ps4\u2013Hba-q3 set on mouse Chromosome 17 is more\nrelated to the 3\u0001 (Hba-ps2\u2013Hba-a2\u2013Hba-q2) set than to the 5\u0001\n(Hba-ps1\u2013Hba-a1\u2013Hba-q1) set on mouse Chromosome 11, prob-\nably a consequence of the temporal order of the duplications of\nthe three gene sets during evolution.\nAnother very interesting sequence feature is highlighted by\ncomparing the sequences of mouse Chromosomes 11 and 17.\nThe PIP (Percentage Identity Plot) of the alignment between\nthese sequences in Figure 3A indicates that, in addition to the\nhomologies between the \u0001-like globin genes, there is sequence\nconservation in the block of tandem repeats (BTR) found \u223c100 bp\nfrom the end of the Hba-q2 gene on Chromosome 11, near the\nbreakpoint in synteny (coordinates \u223c140.7\u2013141.7 kb; R. Hardison\nand W. Miller, unpubl.). These repeats are composed mostly of\n30-mers (e.g., TGTACATGTGCACCTCCTGTTTGATGCTGC),\nquite different in sequence from the 17-mers that constitute the\nhuman 3\u0001-HVR (e.g., ACGGGGGGAACAGCGAC), which lies in a\nsimilar position downstream from the \u0001-globin cluster at 16p13.3\n(Jarman et al. 1986). The dot plot of the mouse Chromosome 17\nsequence against positions 110\u2013153 kb in the mouse Chromo-\nsome 11 sequence clearly demonstrates two BTRs on mouse\nChromosome 17, \u223c15 and 30 kb upstream of Hba-psm (coordi-\nnates \u223c10.4\u201315 kb and \u223c24\u201327.3 kb; Fig. 3B). These are seen as\ntwo dark rectangles created by a series of short parallel diagonals\nfor each repeat unit (see Supplemental material). This indicates\nthat the two blocks of tandem repeats on Chromosome 17 are\ncomposed of the same 30-mer units as the block of tandem re-\npeats on Chromosome 11. However, whereas the BTR on Chro-\nmosome 11 includes 33 copies of the 30-mer, the two BTRs on\nChromosome 17 are larger, containing 153 and 110 copies of the\nrepeat unit. A crossover mediated by alignment of some, but not\nnecessarily all, of these repeats could provide a mechanism by\nwhich dispersal of the present day \u0001-globin clusters to mouse Chro-\nmosomes 11 and 17 may have occurred (Fig. 4; see Discussion).\nDISCUSSION\nWe have previously reported a comparative sequence analysis of\nthe human and mouse \u0001-globin gene clusters at human 16p13.3\nand mouse Chromosome 11, respectively (Flint et al. 2001). We\nshowed that although in both species the arrangement of the\n\u0001-like genes along the chromosome reflects their temporal order\nof expression (embryonic \u0004 to adult \u0001), the detailed organization\nof the globin genes varies between species. For example, in hu-\nman the embryonic gene is duplicated (\u0004, \u0003\u0004), whereas in mouse\nthere is only one single \u0004 gene. Similarly, in mouse the entire\n\u0003\u0001\u2013\u0001\u2013\u0002 block has duplicated, whereas in human only the \u0001 gene\nhas duplicated. Therefore, these duplication events that gener-\nated the contemporary human and mouse clusters must have\noccurred after their diversion from a common ancestor. It is con-\nsequently difficult to propose a potential structure of the \u0001-glo-\nbin cluster in the common mammalian ancestor, although it\nmust have contained at least a copy of each \u0004, \u0001, and \u0002 genes. In\naddition, the ancestral cluster was probably found in a GC-rich\nisochore at a telomeric location, like many of the extant mam-\nmalian \u0001-globin clusters (Hardison and Miller 1993; J. Hughes\nand D.R. Higgs, in prep.). In contrast, the mouse and rat \u0001 clus-\nters appear to have moved to an interstitial position when the\nrodent lineage formed (Hardison and Miller 1993). Consistent\nwith this model, it has been shown that an interstitial telomere\narray is linked to the \u0001-globin cluster on mouse Chromosome 11\n(Elliott and Pazik 1994).\nThe homology between human 16p13.3 and mouse Chro-\nmosome 11 ends at the 3\u0001-end of the mouse 3\u0001 \u0002 (Hba-q2) gene on\nChromosome 11 (Flint et al. 2001). We have now identified a\ncluster of three \u0001-like globin pseudogenes (Hba-psm\u2013Hba-ps4\u2013\nHba-q3) on mouse Chromosome 17, highly related to the 3\u0001 Hba-\nps\u2013Hba-a\u2013Hba-q gene set on Chromosome 11. Comparison of this\nsequence to the human sequence indicates that the homology to\nhuman 16p13.3 resumes at Hba-psm, within the sequenced re-\ngion of Chromosome 17. An in-depth analysis of the sequence\nfrom mouse Chromosome 17 reveals the presence, upstream of\nthe mouse \u0001-like pseudogenes, of duplicated blocks of tandem\nrepeats similar to those found downstream from the \u0001-globin\ncluster on mouse Chromosome 11.\nThe organization and degree of similarity of the \u0001-like genes\nin the two mouse chromosomes and the location of the blocks of\ntandem repeats suggests a relatively simple model to explain the\nevolution of the mouse gene cluster. As shown in Figure 4, we\npropose that in the ancestral chromosome corresponding to\nChromosome 11, three copies of the segment containing the\nthree \u0001-like genes are present, with tandem repeats between the\nlast two copies. Duplicated tandem repeats are present on the\nancestral mouse Chromosome 17 and it is proposed that a re-\ncombination event mediated by a crossover between the tandem\nrepeats may have partitioned the gene cluster on to the two chro-\nmosomes.\nCircumstantial evidence supporting the structure of the hy-\npothetical ancestral mouse Chromosome 11 comes from the\nanalysis of rat chromosome 10 including the rat \u0001-globin cluster\n(http:\/\/genome.ucsc.edu\/). The extent of the synteny between\nrat and human includes all the genes found telomeric to the\n\u0001-globin genes at human 16p13.3 and also the genes centromeric\nto HBA, including LUC7L and extending all the way to AXIN1\nand likely beyond (J.

Higgs, in prep.). This organization bears striking\nsimilarity to the proposed structure of the ancestral mouse Chro-\nmosome 11 (Fig. 4), and indicates that a further duplication of\nthe segment containing the \u0003\u0001\u2013\u0001\u2013\u0002 genes occurred in the rodent\nlineage before rat and mouse diverged. The additional rearrange-\nment, at the 3\u0001-end of the \u0001 cluster, described in this study is\nmouse-specific, that is, it happened after the divergence of mouse\nand rat, and resulted in the translocation of the third \u0003\u0001\u2013\u0001\u2013\u0002\ngene set from the ancestral mouse Chromosome 11 to mouse\nChromosome 17.\nIt is interesting that this mouse-specific rearrangement sepa-\nrated the third gene set from the major \u0001-globin regulatory ele-\nment (m\u0001RE or HS-26) found upstream of the \u0001-globin gene clus-\nter on Chromosome 11. It is probably the lack of this and other\nimportant upstream regulatory elements that underlies the loss\nof function of the gene set on Chromosome 17, and this may\nultimately have been responsible for these genes becoming pseu-\ndogenes. However, it is not possible to distinguish whether the\nloss of function happened at the same time or after the recom-\nbination event that separated the gene cluster to the two mouse\nchromosomes.\nSequence analysis has revealed that the breakpoints of the\nregion of sequence similarity in and around the \u0001-globin gene\nclusters have been created independently in the various species\n(Flint et al. 2001). Intriguingly, blocks of tandem repeats, albeit\ndifferent in sequence, are present in human, mouse, chicken, and\ndog (D.R. Higgs and J. Hughes, unpubl.), near or corresponding\nto the 3\u0001 breakpoint in synteny. Moreover, the 3\u0001 limit of the\n\u0001-globin acetylation domains of mouse and human lie close to or\ncoincide with, these repetitive regions (Anguita et al. 2001). How-\never, the repetitive elements are not conserved at the primary\nsequence level, indicating that the events that gave rise to the\ntandem repeats in the various species happened independently\nafter speciation.\nIt is possible that the repeats represent a \u201csignature\u201d for the\npresence of a nearby chromatin boundary as observed in the\nchicken, mouse, and human \u0005-globin clusters (Chung et al. 1993;\nSaitoh et al. 2000; Farrell et al. 2002), but such role in the regu-\nlation of the \u0001-globin genes or in the boundary formation is\ncurrently untested. Alternatively, their presence could result\nfrom an increased recombination rate in this region of the chro-\nmosome. In support of the presence of a putative recombination\nhot spot within the fragment containing the BTR, we have pre-\nviously noted that in several deletions that cause \u0001-thalassaemia,\nthe 3\u0001 breakpoints also cluster in this region (Horsley et al. 2001).\nAlthough the relationship between recombination hot spots and\nsynteny breakpoints in the mouse genome has not yet been ana-\nlyzed in detail, this is not the first time that tandem repeats have\nbeen identified at synteny breakpoints. For example, a previously\nreported comparison of human 19p13.3 to mouse Chromosome\n10 has revealed an association between the presence of simple\nrepeat sequences and chromosome breaks during evolution (Put-\ntagunta et al. 2000).\nMETHODS\nThe previously isolated (Sutherland et al. 1995) P1 clone 17N8\nfrom the ICRF P703 C57BL\/6 mouse genomic library was se-\nquenced as described in Flint et al. (1997). Sequences were\nmasked using RepeatMasker (http:\/\/ftp.genome.washington.\nedu\/RM\/RepeatMasker.html) and annotated by sequence homol-\nogy as outlined in Flint et al. (2001). Sequence comparisons were\nperformed using the PipMaker Web site (http:\/\/bio.cse.psu.edu\/\npipmaker), which permits the comparison of two long DNA se-\nquences. The alignments can be displayed either as a dot plot,\nallowing the identification of the homologous segments in both\nsequences, or as a percent identity plot (pip), showing both the\nposition in one sequence and the degree of similarity for each\naligning segment between the two sequences (Schwartz et al.\n2000).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Jonathan Flint and John Peden for the initial help with\nthe sequence analysis, and Chris Talbot for helpful discussions.\nSupport for this work was provided by the Medical Research\nCouncil (C.T., J.H., K.C., N.V., and D.R.H.), and the National\nInstitutes of Health, USA Grant #DK27635 (R.H.) and Grant\n#HG02238 (W.M.).
