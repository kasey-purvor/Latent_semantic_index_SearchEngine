To\ndemonstrate these difficulties the article considers the general reasons for\nand against co-operation between social NGOs and then examines the \ndifficulties and advantages of collective EU social NGO action during the\n1998 NGO funding crisis, Red Card protest and civil dialogue. The article\nargues that there is a fundamental desire for, and are benefits from, close\nco-operation between the EU social NGOs. However, due to the complex\n\u2018context structure\u2019 within which NGOs must operate, this co-operative\nimpetus is constantly undermined. In conclusion, the article argues \nthat social NGOs will remain weak and insignificant actors until \nthe Commission\/Parliament and\/or the social NGOs can organise the\ncomplex context structure and allow co-operative strategies to emerge.\nThe fate of the European social model has been a central question of the\n1980s and 1990s. Debates have raged over its definition, content and\nability to defend itself against the pressures of economic globalisation and\nEuropean integration (Hay, 1998; Hay and Marsh, 2000). A central\naspect of this debate has been the development and potential role of EU\nsocial policy. An early assumption of defenders of the European social\nmodel was that a stronger EU social policy could act as a bulwark against\ninternational and European deregulatory and market-oriented forces\n(Martin, 1989). Built into this assumption was the hope that EU social\npolicy could and should be promoted by a strong and extensive array of\nEuropean level social non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Often\nlabelled the \u2018civil dialogue\u2019, these social NGOs were supposed to form the\npolitical and institutional backbone of a social policy network which\nwould help to maintain the \u2018human face\u2019 of the EU and by implication\ndefend the fundamental European social model.\nJnl Soc. Pol., 30, 3, 477\u2013493 Printed in the United Kingdom 477\n\u00a9 2001 Cambridge University Press\n*Lecturer, School of Politics and Communications, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7ZT.\nDespite the high hopes generated by the creation of the EU\u2019s Social\nCharter and Social Dimension in the early 1990s, EU social policy has\nfailed to fulfil these hopes. Likewise, EU social NGOs have generally\nremained small, poor and weak organisations exercising only a limited\ndegree of influence over the EU policy process and struggling to co-operate\nwith each other on fundamental social issues and political strategies. Why\nhave EU social policy and the EU social NGOs failed to develop?\nThe fate of EU social policy is a major issue and has been addressed in a\nnumber of larger works (Beck, 1998; Cram, 1993 and 1997; Falkner,\n1998; Geyer, 2000; Gold, 1993; Hantrais, 2000; Leibfried and Pierson,\n1995; Majone, 1993 and 1996; Springer, 1994; Sykes and Alcock, 1998).\nHowever, the plight of the social NGOs remains a new and unexplored area.\nThis article will argue that, even if EU social policy had been more success-\nful, EU social NGOs would have been unlikely to develop beyond their pre-\nsent position due to underlying blockages to their co-operative capabilities.\nBasically, despite similar general interests, institutional positions and politi-\ncal constraints, EU social NGOs are caught within a very complex and\nmulti-level \u2018political opportunity structure\u2019 or \u2018context structure\u2019(Marks,\n1993; Marks and McAdam, 1996; Marks et al., 1996) which mitigates\nagainst co-operative strategies except on the most fundamental issues. To\nexplore the nature of this complex and multi-level context, this article will\nexamine the general reasons for and against co-operation between social\nNGOs. Then, it will explore the difficulties and advantages of collective EU\nsocial NGO action through a review of the 1998 NGO funding crisis, Red\nCard protest and civil dialogue. \nThis article will conclude by arguing that, due to the weakness of EU\nsocial policy and complex context structure, social NGOs remain very\nweak at the EU level. Further, the Commission and Parliament (the\nstrongest institutional supporters of social policy development) have been\nunwilling\/unable to significantly increase support and funding for social\nNGOs, or alter the complex context structure. If the social NGOs are going\nto progress, the EU institutions have to simplify their complex context and\norganise them and\/or the social NGOs have to organise themselves.\nArguably both steps are difficult, but necessary, for the future of social\nEurope.\nW H Y E U S O C I A L N G O S S H O U L D C O - O P E R AT E A N D W H Y T H E Y D O N \u2019 T\nThere is a growing literature on EU interest group activity (Cullen, 1999;\nGreenwood, 1997; Greenwood and Aspinwall, 1998; Mazey and\nRichardson, 1993; McLaughlin and Greenwood, 1995; Pedler and Van\nSchendelen, 1994; Taylor, 2000) and there are a number of obvious reasons\n478 Robert Geyer\nwhy EU social NGOs should be able to co-operate extensively. First, they\nare all, relative to most other EU interest groups, young, poor and weak.\nMost have only existed since the early 1990s, have minimal financial\nresources (under \u00db500,000 annual budget), a few staff (generally under\n5 staff members) and little institutional and political clout within the EU\ninstitutions and with their national and sub-national member organisa-\ntions. Second, they generally rely on similar financial resources. Nearly\nall of the 30 members of the Platform of European Social NGOs (Platform)\nare heavily funded (60\u201390 per cent of total funding) by the EU. Third,\nthey have and maintain an extensive informal network. Due to the small\nsize and number of the social NGOs, their close proximity to each other in\nthe centre of Brussels and their constant interaction at various European\nsocial policy forums they have evolved a significant informal network as\nwell. Social NGO actors are aware of each other and are often on first\nname basis. Moreover, individuals working for one NGO may often find\nemployment with another Social NGO. Fourth, they have a common \nformal network. Supported by the EU, the social NGOs have structured\nconsultations through the Platform, the bi-annual meetings of the\nEuropean Social Policy Forum, institutionalised twice yearly meetings\nbetween the Platform, Parliament, Commission and European Trade\nUnion Confederation (ETUC) and frequent policy specific meetings\nregarding particular Commission proposals. Fifth, relative to other EU\ninterest groups, social NGOs are ideologically similar and coherent. Their\nbroad interest in social issues, containing market forces and promoting\nwelfarist\/social issues makes them politically and ideologically compati-\nble. Consequently, they can often agree on broad policies and principles.\nSixth, they are all caught within a similar institutional position. They are\nsmall and weak actors relative to the supportive Commission and\nParliament and sceptical Council. The have little, if any, control over their\nnational member organisations. Furthermore, they interact within simi-\nlar international, European and national demands and constraints.\nThus, they are often faced with similar pressures, demands and strate-\ngies. This fundamentally similar context should lead to the development\nof co-operative strategies for dealing with similar problems and opportu-\nnities. Seventh and lastly, as argued by neo-functionalists (Haas, 1958;\nRosamond, 2000), with the successful expansion of European integra-\ntion and the common market strategy in the 1980s and 1990s one\nwould expect this success to spill-over into the social arena. As EU social\npolicy expanded and became increasingly embedded in the European pol-\nicy process one would expect social NGOs to be increasingly integrated\nand co-opted into the policy process. This integration should lessen their\nCan EU Social NGOs Co-operate 479\nfundamental national antagonisms, increase the benefits of co-operative\naction and, thus, promote the development of collaborative\/co-operative\nrelations with each other.\nOn the other hand, a general overview of the social NGOs also presents\nseveral reasons why co-operative strategies could be very difficult to\ndevelop and maintain. First, despite their similar weak position relative to\nother non-social EU NGOs, there is a distinct hierarchy between the social\nNGOs. The most obvious indicator is staff and financial resources. The\nlargest and most impressively organised are the European Youth Forum\n(EYF) and European Women\u2019s Lobby (EWL). With staff numbers of 16\u201320\nand 10\u201312, annual budgets of \u00db2 million and \u00db1 million and an impres-\nsive network of expert advisors to draw upon, the EYF and EWL are capa-\nble of performing a variety of lobbying and advocacy activities (providing\nexpert policy and legal advice, composing proposals for the Commission\nand Parliament, responding to legislative developments and competing for\nEU project proposals). At the other extreme would be organisations like\nEurolink Age and Save the Children. Despite representing major organisa-\ntions within the member states, both receive minimal (under \u00db100,000)\nor no funding from the EU and have one to two staff members.\nConsequently, staff time and energies are concentrated on a few policies or\nevents. Policy initiatives are minimal and scare time is often used to create\nproposals for projects with uncertain funding. Obviously, co-operative\nstrategies between these actors must take into account their relative capa-\nbility imbalances. From their position of strength, the EYF and EWL have\nlittle reason to put time and effort (altering their proposals, pushing for\njoint issues, making time to deal with their concerns, etc.) into co-operat-\ning with Eurolink Age or Save the Children. At the same time, Eurolink\nAge and Save the Children may fear that co-operation with a larger organ-\nisation would merely overwhelm their own activities.\nSecond, though most EU social NGOs rely heavily on EU funding, there\nis a marked difference between the three main types of funding (A-budget\nline funding, B-budget line funding and project funding) which the EU\nprovides. Of the three types, A-budget line funding is the most stable and\nsecure. Basically, A-budget lines are for funding EU administrative activi-\nties, are generally seen as long term economic commitments of over five\nto six years and are relatively immune from budgetary challenges in the\nparliament. Only a few social NGOs are funded with A-budget lines. The\nkey examples are the EWL and the EYF. B-budget line funding is linked to\nparticular policy areas and proposals, is based on two to three year pro-\ngrammes and is fully reviewed at the end of each programme. Currently,\nmost of the funding for social NGOs comes through B-budget lines. These\n480 Robert Geyer\nbudget lines are much more unstable, politically weaker and must be \nconstantly defended and justified by the social NGOs. Lastly, project fund-\ning is utilised by most social NGOs as well. However, project funding is\ngenerally short term (under one to two years), takes a significant amount\nof resources to obtain (particularly following the creation of detailed EU\napplication, implementation and evaluation procedures) and carries no\nguarantee of further funding once the project is complete. These different\ntypes of funding create distinctive pressures and needs for the social\nNGOs. Not only must they compete over how the budget is allocated, \nbut over the type of budget line which will support their activities and\nindividual EU projects. \nThird, as discussed earlier, the social NGOs display clear elements of \nan extensive and intensive informal network. However, this informality\ncan easily lead to \u2018in\u2019 and \u2018out\u2019 groups and divisive personal struggles.\nDuring my recent interviews with social NGOs most respondents agreed\nthat informal relations were generally good between the social NGOs.\nNevertheless, there were clear antagonisms between some of the groups,\nparticularly between poorly funded B-budget line NGOs and better funded\nA-budget line NGOs. Difficulties such as these are not unusual between\ninterest groups, or most types of organisations. It is merely important to\npoint out that these divisions create difficulties for co-ordinating common\nstrategies between the NGOs.\nFourth, by most accounts, the Platform has been a successful formal\nnetwork of organising social NGOs and co-ordinating their responses to\ncommon social policy difficulties and strategies. However, a number of\ntensions were apparent during my interviews with Platform members.\nSome members were concerned that they were not being heard by the\nPlatform. Others were afraid that the Commission and parliament would\nincreasingly turn to the Platform for consultations rather than to their\nown organisations due to the Commission\u2019s and parliament\u2019s desire for\none single point of social NGO input. Some even complained that the\nPlatform might become a career platform for particularly ambitious NGO\nactors. Overall, the Platform was seen as dynamic and useful, particu-\nlarly during the past two to three years. Nevertheless, tensions within the\nmembers towards the Platform remain.\nFifth, despite general ideological similarities regarding social policy and\nwelfarist issues, the social NGOs often represent groups that can be\nstrongly antagonistic to each other. Some examples are obvious. The\nInternational Gay and Lesbian Alliance sits rather uneasily with the \nfamily organisations. Furthermore, my interviews revealed a number of\ntensions between other groups, which on the surface should be close\nCan EU Social NGOs Co-operate 481\nallies, such as the EYF and Save the Children. The key point is that despite\nsome general ideological similarities, these organisations often represent\nantagonistic groups and are caught within a competitive situation for\nfunding and institutional attention from the EU. It is not surprising that\ngroup tensions would emerge.\nSixth, despite general similarities, their institutional position and \ncontext can vary remarkably. For examples, on top of international,\nEuropean and member state dynamics the EDF has to deal with complex\ndivisions within its own membership over types of disabilities and their\nrelative importance within the disability movement. The EYF is a strongly\nEU oriented organisation with a significant and secure budget that pays\nlittle attention to other international organisations or issues. Meanwhile,\nthe European Public Health Alliance has a strong link to the World\nHealth Organisation and other international health forums and is ham-\npered in its EU activities by the fact that it is linked to the only section of\nthe Employment and Social Affairs DG (formerly DG5) that is based in\nLuxembourg rather than Brussels. Another example is the European\nMigrants Forum which has a very diverse and divided membership and\ncompetes against other European migrant organisations for EU funding\nand attention. The key implication is that like the complex and \nmulti-level EU, social NGOs inhabit an even more complex and diverse\nuniverse of demands and interests. Given this complexity, it is impressive\nthat these groups are able to co-operate at all.\nSeventh and lastly, I would argue that some degree of spill-over has\noccurred and that social integration has been pushed forward by eco-\nnomic integration. However, this spill-over has not been even or constant.\nAs discussed in other works (Geyer, 2000; Hantrais, 2000; Leibfried and\nPierson, 1995), EU social policy has developed in fits and starts and is\nvery uneven. EU social policy is well established in gender, youth and\nsome areas of labour policy; less developed in disability, public health and\nanti-poverty policy; and poorly established in anti-racism and elderly pol-\nicy. These differing levels of policy development generate different tactics\nand interests for the NGOs. NGOs in entrenched policy areas may try to\nfocus on legal channels and strategies to further their particular agendas.\nMeanwhile, NGOs in weaker areas may focus all of their energies on a\nnew legislative initiative or treaty base. These differing conditions and\nstrategies may easily generate tensions and divisions between the more\nand less successful social NGOs. Moreover, these differences are very\nunlikely to be dissipated in the near future.\nOverall, this general review oversimplifies the issue of co-operative vs.\nconflictual dynamics between the social NGOs. Undoubtedly, a significant\n482 Robert Geyer\namount of co-operative behaviour is occurring between the groups.\nNevertheless, this co-operation is not easy or automatic and has to \novercome significant and complex clashes of interest and institutional\npositions. To explore more concretely the delicate nature of social NGOs\u2019\nco-operative strategies the article will now turn to the cases of the 1998\nfunding crisis, Red Card protest and current campaign to promote the\ncivil dialogue.\nT H E 1 9 9 8 F U N D I N G C R I S I S ,  R E D C A R D C A M PA I G N A N D C I V I L\nD I A L O G U E\nAs most observers would admit, funding for EU social NGOs emerged in a\nrandom fashion. Some groups received funding in the 1980s and have A-\nbudget lines (the EWL and EYF). Most groups were founded in the 1990s\nand funding was based on Declaration 23 of the Maastricht Treaty which\nstated that:\nThe Conference stresses the importance, in pursuing the objectives of Article117\u2026 \nof cooperation between the latter and charitable associations and foundations as institu-\ntions responsible for social welfare establishments and services\nThese groups receive a combination of B-budget line funding and project\nbased funding. This ad hoc development was due to several factors. The\nfact that the EU was pushing into new social policy areas, which lacked a\nbase in the treaties, made clear funding guidelines difficult. Also, the\ndevelopment of parliament\u2019s powers of budgetary oversight complicated\nthe politics of funding for social policy NGOs. The Parliament has \ngenerally been a keen supporter of social policy. However, as the political\ncomplexion of parliament changes, so do its social policy positions. Lastly,\nalthough the Employment and Social Affairs DG (formerly DGV) has been\na strong social NGO supporter it is also caught within budgetary strug-\ngles with different DGs and the Council. Consequently, funding for NGOs\nhas been uneven, unstable and lacking an overall coherent strategy or\njustification.\nThis incoherence was starkly highlighted by the impact of Case 106 of\nthe European Court of Justice (ECJ). In May 1998 nearly \u00db1 billion of EU\nsocial policy funding was brought into question by the results of a \ndecision from the ECJ on Case 106\/96. The issue upon which this deci-\nsion was based was located in the inter-institutional struggles between\nthe EU Council and EU Commission. In 1994, the Council rejected the\nCommission\u2019s 1994 EU anti-poverty programme. The Commission and\nParliament responded by attempting to continue funding some of its \nearlier anti-poverty programmes through their discretionary budgetary\nCan EU Social NGOs Co-operate 483\npowers. In 1996, the British Conservative government (backed by\nGermany, Denmark and the Council) challenged the right of the\nCommission to allocate these funds without a \u2018legal base\u2019, such as a\nDecision from the Council. On 12 May 1998, the ECJ found in favour of\nBritain, arguing that the Commission had spent money to finance \u2018signif-\nicant\u2019 actions which the Commission could only do if it had a legal base\n(i.e. a Council decision). Following the ECJ\u2019s ruling, on 10 June the\nCommission decided to launch a review of all budget lines (over 100)\nwithout a legal basis and to freeze all lines without a legal base during the\nreview process. This result unleashed a wave of confusion in the EU insti-\ntutions since it curtailed the right of the Commission to allocate nearly\n\u00db1 billion of social funding, reasserted the power of the Council over the\nCommission, and antagonised the EU Parliament since many of its small\nprojects were funded with discretionary Commission funds.\nEU social NGOs were shocked and dismayed. Not only was their project\nfunding under threat, but their own existence was threatened as well\nsince many received a substantial proportion of their organisational\nincome from the EU. In response, the social NGOs took three key steps:\nthe mobilisation of social NGOs through the Platform, the publicising of\nthe crisis through the Red Card campaign and the formation of an\nalliance with development NGOs and human rights NGOs.\nIn many ways, this was the crucial moment for the Platform. The\nPlatform had only been established in the mid-1990s and was still strug-\ngling to find a clear role in its relationship to the social NGOs. As shown\nearlier, the distinctive positions and interests of the social NGOs makes it\nvery difficult to find clear \u2018horizontal\u2019 issues which they could all agree\nupon. However, the funding crisis was just such an issue. The Platform\nquickly became the centrepoint for organising the response to the fund-\ning crisis, organising actions at member state and the European level. For\nexample, it encouraged all member organisations to write letters to their\nMEPs, Council representatives and national governments protesting the\ncrisis. Further, using the Social Policy Forum, a bi-annual meeting of over\n2000 social NGOs which just happened to be occurring in late June\n1998, the Platform organised a \u2018red card\u2019 protest. Taking its signal from\nthe World Cup (going on in France at that time), the Platform distributed\n\u2018red cards\u2019 to all of the participants at the Social Policy Forum. Whenever\nan EU official was present the participants would show them the \u2018red\ncard\u2019.\nTo co-ordinate the \u2018red card\u2019 protest and meetings with EU officials, the\nPlatform formed an alliance with the development and human rights\nNGOs. This alliance led to an impressive and unprecedented degree of \n484 Robert Geyer\npublicity for the normally unknown social NGOs and the funding crisis.\nCo-ordinated by the Platform, this grouping had two main demands. They\ncalled for an immediate resumption of budgetary allocation for all of the\nNGO budget lines. The key point for all of the NGOs was that their various\nbudgets were frozen. They could do nothing, continue existing operations,\nplan for future developments and\/or pay staff (!), until the crisis was\nresolved. Furthermore, they demanded that the larger issue of the general\nstatus of NGOs and their relationship to the EU institutions be addressed.\nAs a May 1998 Platform document argued before the funding crisis:\nAt present, there is no legal basis for consulting NGOs. Consultations are still initiated by\nthe individual Commission Directorates General when they feel the need with no moves\nto draw everything together. The first essential step in this direction is for the Commission\nto compile a List of INGOs [International Non-Governmental Organisations] with which it\nwould consult on a regular and systematic basis\u2026The compilation of this List would also\nbe an opportunity for regulating the relations between listed INGOs and the European\nCommission in a formal legal instrument, setting out the rights and duties of each.\n(Platform, May 1998)\nUnder pressure from this alliance the Commission and Parliament began\nto actively seek ways to keep the complicated array of programmes afloat\nwhile social NGOs struggled to make sure that their particular policy\nareas were saved. The immediate goal of the Platform was to release the\nfunds already allocated in existing budget lines. Pressure continued until\nthe Budget Council meeting on 17 July when over 75per cent of budget\nlines were unblocked. Furthermore, the Council encouraged the\nParliament and Commission to find appropriate bases for the still blocked\nlines, particularly re-framing and re-grouping them under Article 13\nand\/or 137 of the Amsterdam Treaty. The Council also clarified the defin-\nition of a \u2018pilot action\u2019 and a \u2018preparatory action\u2019 and set spending and\ntime limits for both. Most importantly for the NGOs, the Council decided\nthat preparatory actions connected to the Amsterdam Treaty could start\nbefore the ratification of the treaty and that a preparatory action could\ncontinue even if a programme from which it is proposed is still awaiting a\nlegal basis. This was absolutely essential to maintain funding for the\nNGOs through 1998 and 1999. However, it left the budgetary position\nbeyond 1999 uncertain.\nThroughout 1999 and 2000, the Platform, social NGOs and their sup-\nporters in the Commission and Parliament worked tirelessly to create a\nmore stable and secure position for the social NGOs. This work revolved\naround the institutionalisation of the civil dialogue. Before discussing their\nmost recent activities it is necessary to take a brief look at the foundation\nof the idea of the civil dialogue.\nCan EU Social NGOs Co-operate 485\nThe idea of the civil dialogue has its roots in the political traditions of the\nNetherlands and Germany and had been discussed within the EU since the\nearly-1990s (Kendall and Anheier, 1999; Platform, November 1999; Taylor,\n2000). Declaration 23 of the Maastricht Treaty mentioned the importance\nof dialogue between the EU and \u2018charitable associations and foundations\u2026\nresponsible for social welfare establishments and services\u2019. In 1996, the\nreport from the Committee of Sages on the future of civil and social rights in\nEurope concluded that both a social dialogue (involving capital, labour and\nthe EU) and a civil dialogue (involving the broader NGO community and the\nEU) were necessary for the promotion of fundamental rights:\nNon-governmental associations and organisations seem likely to play an increasing role\nin society, especially as regards the rights of the unemployed and the elderly. How they\ncan be recognised as partners in this slow, self-transforming progress of society towards\nthe recognition and implementation of new rights, especially those intended to prevent or\nend exclusion, is thus an important aspect of the fundamental rights question.\n(Committee of Sages, 1996, p. 55)\nFurthermore, at the same time Employment and Social Affairs DG in the\nCommission and the Social Affairs Committee in the Parliament were\nworking together to promote a more general Social Policy Forum, a bi-\nannual mass meeting of all NGOs linked to the social field. The first was\nheld in 1996 and the second in 1998. Despite the significant participa-\ntion of NGOs (over 2000 attended the second forum) and the success of\nthe second forum at helping to raise the funding crisis issue, general NGO\nopinion of the forums was divided. Most NGOs found the forums useful,\nbut did not see them as a replacement for full consultation with the EU\ninstitutions (Hughes, 1999, p. 3). Lastly, in 1996 the Commission and\nParliament created and funded the Platform of European Social NGOs in\norder to strengthen the voice of and co-ordination between the social\nNGOs and consequently the civil dialogue.\nThe Employment and Social Affairs DG, Platform and, in particular,\nEmployment and Social Affairs Committee in the Parliament (led by MEP\nStephen Hughes until mid-1999 and currently chaired by the French MEP\nM. Rocard) continued to press for a more institutionalised form of civil dia-\nlogue. The Committee held a series of hearings on the civil dialogue in\nearly 1998 with the social NGOs. The conclusions of these hearings were\nintegrated into the Parliament\u2019s Ghilardotti Report on various aspects of\nthe non-profit sector. The conclusion of the report called for, \u2018a serious,\nstructured sectoral dialogue to be set in motion between the European\ninstitutions and the NGOs represented at European level\u2019 and saw the\nPlatform as a model for other sectors of the civil dialogue (Hughes, 1999,\np. 5). Following this, the Commission and the Parliament both established\n486 Robert Geyer\nregular twice yearly meetings with the Platform. Despite these develop-\nments, the Commission did not include a call for the development of a civil\ndialogue in its 1998\u20132000 Social Action Programme.\nIn the aftermath of the funding crisis, the Platform has concentrated\nmuch of its resources on the creation of the civil dialogue. In June 1999 it\npublished a document on social NGO funding which made four proposals\nfor strengthening the civil dialogue:  \n1. European NGOs who comply to clearly laid out criteria of representa-\ntivity, effectiveness, good governance and management and compli-\nance with equal opportunities should be eligible to receive core fund-\ning, which should be on a multi-annual basis and include appropriate\nsecretariat and management costs, as well as the costs of convening\nstatutory meetings.\n2. An equitable and efficient schedule for grant applications and pay-\nments needs to be put in place\u2026\n3. Projects and budgets should be agreed in principle between the\nCommission and the NGO at least four months before the start of the\nyear.\n4. The responsibility for the matters such as contracts, payments, calls\nfor projects and problems over funding should be clearly defined both\nat the level of officials and at the political level. (Platform, June 1999,\np. 2)\nLater, in October 1999, after the Platform was made aware of a forthcom-\ning Commission document on the civil dialogue, the Platform attempted\nto structure the early debate with a number of \u2018political recommenda-\ntions\u2019. In this document, the Platform re-emphasised the important role\nof the social NGOs and stressed the importance which Declaration 38 of\nthe Amsterdam Treaty gave them:\nThe Conference recognises the important contribution made by voluntary service activi-\nties to developing social solidarity.\nHowever, the Platform emphasised that there was a growing need to\ndevelop a \u2018more horizontal and coherent approach to the consultation of\nNGOs\u2019 which would be based on, \u2018an Article (in the Treaty of the\nEuropean Union) to give a legal underpinning to the civil dialogue\u2019\n(Platform, October 1999, p. 2). Finally, in order to implement the dia-\nlogue, it should be made into a \u2018structured process, which includes the\nelaboration, monitoring and evaluation of EU policies\u2019. Also, the\nCommission should, \u2018compile a list of accredited NGOs operating at the\nEU level with which it would consult\u2019 (Platform, October 1999, p. 2).\nCan EU Social NGOs Co-operate 487\nOverall, the Platform was trying to play both a detailed and general\nstrategy. At the detailed level, it was trying to solve a number of the\nannoying budgetary aspects of the social NGO \u2013 EU relationship includ-\ning issues of timing for payments, criteria for EU funding eligibility and\ndefining responsibilities. These were obvious small problems that were\nafflicting a number of social NGOs. However, this detailed strategy was\nlinked to the larger one of institutionalising the civil dialogue in the EU\ntreaty and forcing the EU to create a list or system for accrediting and\nsupporting social NGOs. This combination of strategies was clearly neces-\nsary to satisfy the needs of the social NGOs who were directly affected by\nthe funding crisis and the interests of those who were less affected.\nMoreover, the emphasis on getting the EU to create a list of accredited\nNGOs was particularly interesting in that the Platform clearly wanted to\navoid being the group responsible for picking which NGOs were, and were\nnot, acceptable. This would put it in a delicate political situation it did not\ndesire, nor was capable of resolving. \nUnfortunately for the Platform and social NGOs, the Commission and\nCouncil were reluctant to quickly alter the existing nature of the civil dia-\nlogue. In its most recent document on the civil dialogue, after listing the\nvarious benefits of the civil dialogue, the Commission resisted a number\nof the Platform\u2019s demands. In relation to the complaints about the overly\nbureaucratic proposal process, the Commission argued that:\nRegarding funding, the NGOs must accept, for example, that there will always be a legiti-\nmate need for the Commission to impose certain conditions and controls to safeguard\ncommunity funds. NGOs have a duty to demonstrate that they have the expertise, man-\nagement systems and internal quality control systems appropriate to the work they are\nundertaking. (Commission, 2000, p. 9)\nFor the existing informal contacts between the NGOs and EU, \u2018the steer-\ning group sees the current informal co-operation as useful and wishes it\nto continue\u2019 (Commission, 2000, p. 11). However, the document did\nstress that, \u2018The Commission therefore wishes to develop a framework of\nprinciples for creating a more structured dialogue with NGOs\u2019\n(Commission, 2000, p. 12). The document went on to outline the possi-\nble lines of debate over how best to institutionalise the civil dialogue.\nRegarding a new legal basis for the civil dialogue, the document only\nmentioned it in passing and made no specific proposals. Regarding fund-\ning issues, the document noted that the division between A- and B-bud-\nget lines was incoherent and arbitrary and that the Commission intends\nto develop a new system. However, this was clearly linked to a variety of\nother issues and was not expected to be resolved until the 2001 budget.\nLastly, the document rejected the demands for the Commission to accredit\n488 Robert Geyer\nsocial NGOs arguing that the Commission had always, \u2018wanted to main-\ntain a dialogue which is as open as possible without having to enforce an\naccreditation system\u2019 (Commission, 2000, p. 14).\nAs of Summer 2000, the state of affairs for the funding crisis and civil\ndialogue is one of stasis and small-scale adjustments. The Parliament and\nCommission recognise that the system of funding for the social NGOs is ad\nhoc and confusing. However, the solution to these difficulties is wrapped\naround a number of larger administrative and political issues. For exam-\nple, the elimination of the distinction between A- and B-budget lines will\nobviously have a fundamental impact on the administrative functioning\nof the entire EU. Moreover, not only is this an administrative problem but\nit has clear political implications as well. The social NGOs benefited from\na supportive Parliament which was able and willing to establish multiple\nand ad hoc budget lines to support them. Rationalisation of these budget\nlines may not only threaten the social NGOs, but it may threaten the\npower of the Parliament in relation to the Council. Finally, in the\nPresidency conclusions at the March Lisbon Council, the Council con-\ncluded, under the section on \u2018promoting social inclusion\u2019 that it will,\npursue its reflection on the future direction of social policy\u2026 with a view to reaching\nagreement on a European Social Agenda at the Nice European Council in December,\nincluding the initiatives of the different partners involved.\nThe issue of the civil dialogue is alive, but it is clearly going to have to wait\nuntil December 2000 before the Council will take a view on it.\nC O N C L U S I O N S\nAs is well known, the EU is a complex multilevel institution. At the centre\nof this complexity are the social NGOs, busily balancing member,\nnational, European and international developments, interests and strate-\ngies. In this complex context structure, co-operative action is difficult to\nachieve even with a number of institutional similarities and formal and\ninformal networks. As the funding crisis and its aftermath demonstrated,\nonly the most basic of issues can result in significant and sustained \nco-operative action. The crisis not only provided a focus for collective\naction for social NGOs, but encouraged the revival of the languishing\nPlatform and created opportunities for linkages to other environmental\nand development NGOs and labour organisations. Nevertheless, other,\nless fundamental issues, would be unlikely to generate this level of \nco-operative activity.\nIf the above is correct, then the solution to the collective weakness of\nthe social NGOs would be to simplify or organise their complex context\nCan EU Social NGOs Co-operate 489\nstructure in order to create more common issues around which co-operative\nstrategies could emerge. In the context of a complex and multilevel EU,\nthis would not be an easy task. Nevertheless, there are two main groups\nof actors who could potentially do it: the EU institutions (particularly the\nCommission and Parliament) and the social NGOs. As seen above, the\nCommission and Parliament have been strong supporters of social NGOs,\nbut have been unable or unwilling to increase and organise NGO funding\nor act as a gatekeeper\/organiser for social NGOs. The funding issue is\nobviously linked to larger political battles within and between the\nParliament, Commission and Council. Greater funding would clearly\nhave an immediate impact on the NGOs. However, in the current context\nit is extremely difficult to imagine a constellation of political forces which\nwould enable significantly greater funding. Moreover, the unwillingness\nof the Commission and\/or Parliament to act as a gatekeeper seems to be\nbased on a desire to maintain the pluralism of the social NGO community,\nto avoid direct responsibility for the funding situation of the social \nNGOs and to continue the complexity of the budgetary process in order to\navoid the reassertion of Council control over budgetary procedures.\nNevertheless, these blockages will have to be overcome by pro-social \npolicy forces within the EU if a more powerful social NGO movement and\nsocial policy are to be created. The Commission and\/or Parliament \nwill have to accept a greater degree of responsibility for the social \nNGOs including: greater funding, more equal funding and acting as a\ngatekeeper of funded NGOs. This raises obvious problems of NGO inde-\npendence in relation to the EU. However, in the current context, where\nNGOs are so weak, it may be a reasonable price to pay.\nThe other key actors are the social NGOs themselves. Driven by their\nweakness and their formal and informal networks, the social NGOs have\nalready developed a degree of co-operative activities and co-ordinated pol-\nicy action. However, their divergent interests and complex context struc-\nture constantly undercut these collective strategies on all but the most\nfundamental issues. One response to this weakness could be greater NGO\norganisation. Using the Platform as a base, the NGOs could agree to pool\ntheir limited resources to demand greater and consistent funding and \nkey policy strategies for a recognised group of social NGOs. In essence, the\nPlatform, or some similar organisation, would become the NGO gate-\nkeeper, removing the administrative and political burden from the\nParliament\/Commission and strengthening the organised NGOs in the\nprocess. \nThis strategy is full of obvious risks and difficulties. How would one deter-\nmine an \u2018acceptable\u2019 social NGO? How would funding be allocated? Would\n490 Robert Geyer\nit lead to a more powerful social NGO voice? Would the organised social\nNGOs be co-opted by the EU and ignore their national and sub-national\nroots? There are no clear answers to these questions. Nevertheless, the risks\nmay be worth taking. At present, the social NGOs have a great deal of \nfreedom, but little influence. Sacrificing some of their independence \nfor greater organisational coherence may be the only way for them to \nsignificantly promote EU social policy.\nLastly, it is likely that some combination of these two strategies may\nemerge, combining a stronger central social NGO organisation with\ngreater regulation by or reliance on the Commission and Parliament.\nPredicting the exact structure is clearly beyond the limits of this article.\nNevertheless, given the current complex context structure, social NGOs\nwill have to be organised or organise themselves in order to become a\nmajor factor in the future of EU social policy. \nN O T E S\n1 The Platform was created in mid-1996 to promote and co-ordinate the development of the\nsocial NGOs. It has a small staff (four to five members) and is primarily funded by the EU.\n2 Recently, the general secretary of a leading social NGO moved on to a position in the\nCommission and was replaced by the head of another social NGO who was married to the head\nof another social NGO. This is not an attack on any of these individuals. It merely high-\nlights the very close informal relationships between the social NGOs.\n3 Both Employment and Social Affairs P. Flynn and A. Diamontopoulou have encouraged the\nsocial NGOs to comment on both general and specific social policy proposals. In March 2000,\nCommissioner Diamontopoulou has issued a general social policy proposal outline to the social\nNGOs in order to develop strategies and ideas and gauge the level of political support for certain\ninitiatives.\n4 In October 2000 Eurolink Age merged with two other organisations to form the European\nOlder People\u2019s Platform. According to the Director of Eurolink Age, this was done to strengthen\nthe influence of organisations for older people and to create a \u2018more European\u2019 organisation to\nenhance funding possibilities from the EU level. \n5 A recent exception to this was the challenging for the EWL\u2019s A-budget line in the parliament by\nthe Irish MEP Dana Rosemary Scallon, the former Eurovision song contest winner, who was\nrumoured to have opposed the funding of the EWL because of its stance on the right to abortion.\n6 I performed twenty-one semi-structured interviews during 21\u201329 March 2000. These\nincluded twelve members of the Platform of European Social NGOs, actors within the Platform,\nCommission, Parliament, and ETUC. All of the interviewees were selected because of their close\nengagement with the EU social policy process. Of the Platform members, I interviewed disabil-\nity, anti-poverty, youth, elderly, family, gender, child, anti-racism, and health organisation\nrepresentatives. They were selected to provide a wide spread of social issues and to obtain a\ngeneral balance between large (gender, youth, disability) and small (elderly, child and family)\norganisations. The interviews were open, but structured around three main areas: the impact\nof the funding crisis on the NGO and NGO community, the activities and usefulness of the\nPlatform and the challenges to collective action within the NGO community. Interviews with\nNon-NGO actors were oriented towards obtaining information about the budget crisis, Red\nCard protest and civil dialogue, the position of the governmental actors towards the NGOs and\nPlatform and their views regarding the future of EU social policy. \n7 This incoherence may be in the interest of the Parliament since it is a demonstration of the\nParliament\u2019s control over the budget process. If there were clear lines of control and spending\nCan EU Social NGOs Co-operate 491\nguidelines, the Council would be in a better position to exert detailed control over the budget\nprocess.\n8 Social NGOs appealed to the new Labour government in 1997 to withdraw the case. However,\nit chose not to do so.\n9 The Commissioner for the budget, Mr. Liikanen, was accused of interpreting the ECJ\u2019s ruling in\nan unnecessarily strict manner by Commissioners Bonino and Flynn. However, a number of\nscandals had already rocked the Commission and it was not surprising that Liikanen was\ndetermined to pursue a hard line.\n10 In a Platform document written after the \u2018Red Card\u2019 protest, the Platform admitted that: \u2018the\nSocial Forum had been a heaven sent opportunity\u2019 (Platform, October 1998, p.  9).\n11 Even the British newspapers, generally unwilling to notice any social policy activity at the EU\nlevel, carried various articles on the budget crisis and social NGOs\u2019 activities.\n12 A pilot action is an exploratory expenditure which may or may not lead to a programme. It\nmay not last over two years and cannot spend over \u00db16 million in any year. A preparatory\naction is an action leading to the creation of a programme with a legal basis. It may last three\nyears and not exceed \u00db75 million in expenditure.\n13 A fifth lesser proposal included a call to reform the Vademecum agreement on bank grants\nover \u00db100,000.\nR E F E R E N C E S\nBeck, W. et al.
