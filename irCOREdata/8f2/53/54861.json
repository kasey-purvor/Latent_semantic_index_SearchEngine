Through the use of\nzero-voltage switching, and simuple snlubbers, switching losses can be significantly reduced [1]\ncomlapared with hard-switched converter counterparts. Conduction losses, however, can remnain\nsignificant, particularly due to high resonant-tank currents, that can occur when operating far above\nthe resonant frequency at full load. Here then, a design procedure is proposed that assunmes the\nconverter is operated about a specified resonant frequency for a given load and gain. The aim is to\nprovide a converter design to reduce tank currents-in general one would use the design procedure\nand ultinmately operate slightly above resonance, the gain at resonance has therefore to be slightly\nlarger than required. Many of the underlying oquations havc been takcn from previously reported\ndesign methodologics-the rcader will be referred to these publications wherever possible, for brevity.\nThe design process utilises the accuracy of Fundamental Mode Approximnation (FMA) at resonance,\nand the potential for rapid analysis it providos.\n4k\n_ ,c- ~c- .\nL I' fCC,jv1,~~~~~~c, cfRR |vV\nFig. 1: LCC CuLrrent-OuitpuLt resonant converter\nOperation close to resonance\nOpcration at rcsonance miniliises the rcsonant cLirrent, thoreby reducing electrical strosses and\nimproving efficiency.

This, therefore, inplics that (29) will\nalways ensure conitinuous operation.\nCurrent-output design examples\nThe design procedure is therefore summriadsed by (5),(13),(16),(17) and is based on initial design\nconstraints of i) selecting G, = VOsa.\/\u00beijr, ii) selecting a transformer gain UN such that the resonant\ntank gain G1, is as desired iii) choosing a desired nominal switching frequencyf, iii) the minimum\nload resistance RLI\n..i, iv) the value ofA.\nTo provide a degree of validation of the proposed design process, various designs have been obtained\nbased on the requirements given in Table 1. Table 2(a) shows the percentage difference in gain G, and\nresonant frequency of the converters obtained through use of the design methodology, with respect to\nthe desired values specified in Table t. The data is based on the results of SPICE\u00ae simulation studies.\nClearly, component requirements generated by the design methodology will not provide preferred\nvalLucs. By judicious choice of preferred valLucs, about those calculated by the design method, the\nresulting gain errors are shown to be <6% (see Table 2(b)), which is typical of the accuracy normally\nobtained when employing standard industrial grade off-the-shelf components.\nTABLE I: DESIGN REQUIREMENTS\nDesign No. G,(V5V) N(V\/V) f (kHz) Ri,,i (S2) A (F\/F)\n(1) 0.8 01 25 50 2\n(2) 1 0.3 125 2 1.5\n(3) 1.50205 100 500 5(4) 2.5 5 50 0.3 0.5\n(5) 5 1 75 20A\nTABLE II: SPICEt RESULTSWHEN USING (a) IDEAL AND Db) PREFERRED VALUES\n% ErrorComponents\nNo. LI CP CS Gt (V\/V) f4kHz) Gt f,\n(1) 6.33u 17.6u 8.8u 0.82 24.8 2.5 -0.4\n(2) 293n 12.9u 8.6u 1.02 124.3 2.0 -0.6\n(3) 4.08u 3.68u 736n 1.46 100.2 -2.7 0.2\n(4) 7.13u 2.09u 4.18u 2.49 49.9 -0.4 -0.2\n(5) 8.49u 1.06u 1.06u 4.99 74.9 -0.2 -0.1\n(a)\nCoiponenlts Simulation % Error\nNo. LI Co CS Gt (VIV) 4iSkHz) G, fn\n(1) 6.8u 18u 8.2u 0.83 24.6 3.8 -1.6\n(2) 330n 12u 8.2u 0.94 119.4 -6.0 -4.5\n(3) 4.7u 3.9u 680n 1.48 96.2 -1.3 -3.8\n(4) 6.8u 2.2u 4.7u 2.60 49.3 4.0 -1.4\n(5) 8.2u 1.0 l.Ou 4.94 78.4 -1.2 4.5\n(b)\nISBN 90)758t15{--5t' 20L 5-D,idt 1'.6\nRapid Dcsign of LCC Cuntat-oulput Resonant Converwax I3INGHAM CLis\nThere are other ways in which the design equations may be utilised. For instance, it is enltirely possible\nto specify sonm components in advance and solve the design cquations for those remaining. Tho\nconstraints G.>052 and Q,>25, are still necessary to maintain accuracy, however. The designer may\nalso wish to design for a specific Qt and\/or Qr In this case, (6),(22) wiLl provide ftrther constraints on\nA and G, such that a design can be obtained.\nPart-load performance\nIn general, for this converter topology, it can be shown [2] that if QL is chosen to have a relativety tow\nvalIe, at ful load, then operation at part loads restricts a reduction in tank current. Providing (30) is\nsatisfied (to onsure a continuouis parallol capacitor voltago and honco modol accuracy), then, from (6),\nchoosing the lower permissible valic of rosonant tank gain wilt result in a low QL. By way of exaniple,\nFig. 4 shows a 3D plot of QL vs. GI and A.\nQI\n*0\nFig 4: 3D plot of QLvs. G1 andA\nFigure 4 is also consistent with (16), where:\nGI -\n(31)\n16+ (CPzf NZRLfr7\nFrom (31), it can be soee that the closer tho resonant tank gain is to 4\/;T2, and the less sensitive tho\nresonant frequency is to load (i.e A large), the sm-ialler the dependence of the resonant tank gain on\ntoad. As the toad varies, the phase shift abovc resonance necessary to maintain the ouLtpuLt votage will\nrenain small, hence, from (I1), the dependence of resonant current to load is much greater.\nFrom (13), (5) the following expression can be written:\nLSA-G.G 2 AG 2T4 + G 2T4-16\nRL 49G3GI2-16\n(32)\nA 3D plot of (32) is given in Fig.5\nLIt 2005 - Dnsdcn It'\nRapid Dc,-4n of LCC C.m-cnt-outpw Rmwui.

Nomrinally, converters with the same A and resonant tank gain G, possess similar\nproperties, such as nornmalised frequency response. It is feasible that a designer nmay fimd it desirable\nto maintain the properties of a previous design, within a new given specification. The following\nsection therefore demonstrates how onle can simply i) change the miniiimum load ii) change the overall\ngain iii) vary the resonant frequency of an existing design to acconmnodate changes in a given\nspecification.\ni) From (35) it can be seen that whilst changing component paraneters. maintaining the t.h.s\nand A ratio would resutt in a constant resonant tank gain.

Howevor, in\ngeneral, this will esult in a change of resonant frequency. If this is not desired,\nmnaintaining the resonant frequency, from (36), requires a constant C1L product.\nDoubling the resonant inductance and halving the parallel capacitor is therefore necessary.\nii) Alternatively, it may be desirable that the overall gain be doubled. The simplest way in\nwhich to achieve this is via the turns ratio of the transformer. Whiilst mnaintaining the tank\ngain, the transformer gain simpty has to doLblc, i.e N must be halvcd. Since A and the\nresonant tank gain arc to remain constant, further componcnts on the L.h.s muLst changc in\nordcr to mnaintain tho balance, theso being tho rcsonant tank components. From (35) the 4,\n\/Cp ratio must roduce by a factor of 16. In gencral, this will rosult in a changc of rcsonant\nfrequetcy. If this is not desired, mnaitntaining the resonatnt frequency, fromn (36), requires a\nconstant CpL product. Fromi (36) one therefore has to quadruple the parallel capacitance\nand quarter the resonant inductance.\niii) To vary the resonant frequiency, whilst mnaittaining the transformer gain, resonatnt tank\ngain, A and load resistance, one can only vary the resonant com-ponents. From (35) and\n(36) doubling the resonant frequency is achieved by halving both the resonant inductance\nand parallel capacitance.\nEquation (35) is also useful when considering the conversion from ideal to prefcrred component\nvalues, since the gain is usualy the detennining factor in a converter design. From (35) the preferred\ncomponent shoutd be chosen such that the L\/Cp ratio and A ratio are as ctose to ideal as possible. The\ncost of any change in componont valuo will be an altoration in resonant frequency. If component\nvalLuS cannot be found that satisfy tho rcquied ratios, A should be adjusted.\nRectifier diode compensation\nThe design process, as it stands, is based on the assumnption that the overall converter is extremnely\nefficient. It can, however, be readily mnodified to acconnunodate for losses due to the rectifier diodes.\nThe diodes can simply be viewed as a parasitic load resistor. Thus, the overall load resistance will\nbeconme apparently larger, and the gain reduced due to the resulting potential divider network. The\nfollowing expressions can be utilised to conmpensate for the rectifier voltage drop:\nRL Kl\nv ji\n2\nj (37)R =RL 1+ V' G GI =,1+ V')\nwhere RL' and GU are the required effective load resistance and resonant tanlk gain to achieve\nspecifications.\nConclusion\nA sinmple design scheme for LCC current-output resonant converters, is proposed, that is suitable for\nuse in a rapid iterative design environnment e.g. as part of a GUI, and which aims to reduce resonant\ntank curronts-thoreby reducing the electrical stresses on components and improve tank officicncy. A\ncomnparison of results from a nunmber of candidate designs has denmonstrated acecwacy comnparable with\nthat expected fromn the use of comnmercial off-the-shelf comnponents, and their associated tolerances.\nReferences\n[1] \"A compason of Half-Bridge Resonant Connrerter Topologios\" R.L.Steigerwald, IEEE Trans.
