There is increasing recognition that psychosocial interventions may have similar levels of effectiveness to medication, and both can be used in combination. Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is a 7-week cognitive-based approach for dementia that has been shown to be beneficial for cognition and quality of life and is cost-effective, but there is less conclusive evidence for the effects of CST over an extended period. Methods\/Design: This multi-centre, pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) to assess the effectiveness and costeffectiveness of Maintenance CST groups for dementia compares a intervention group who receive CST for 7 weeks followed by the Maintenance CST programme once a week for 24 weeks with the control group who receive CST for 7 weeks, followed by treatment as usual for 24 weeks. The primary outcome measures are quality of life of people with dementia assessed by the QoL-AD and cognition assessed by the ADAS-Cog. Secondary outcomes include the person with dementia's mood, behaviour, activities of daily living, ability to communicate and costs; as well as caregiver health-related quality of life. Using a 5% significance level, comparison of 230 participants will yield 80% power to detect a standardised difference of 0.39 on the ADAS-Cog between the groups. The trial includes a cost-effectiveness analysis from a public sector perspective. Discussion: A pilot study of longer-term Maintenance CST, offering 16 weekly sessions of maintenance following the initial CST programme, previously found a significant improvement in cognitive function (MMSE) for those on the intervention group. The study identified the need for a large-scale, multi-centre RCT to define the potential longerterm benefits of continuing the therapy. This study aims to provide definitive evidence of the potential efficacy of maintenance CST and establish how far the long-term benefits can be compared with antidementia drugs such as cholinesterase inhibitors.

There is increasing recognition that \npsychosocial interventions may have similar levels of effectiveness to medication, and both can be used in \ncombination. Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is a 7-week cognitive-based approach for dementia that has been \nshown to be beneficial for cognition and quality of life and is cost-effective, but there is less conclusive evidence for the \neffects of CST over an extended period.\nMethods\/Design: This multi-centre, pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) to assess the effectiveness and cost-\neffectiveness of Maintenance CST groups for dementia compares a intervention group who receive CST for 7 weeks \nfollowed by the Maintenance CST programme once a week for 24 weeks with the control group who receive CST for 7 \nweeks, followed by treatment as usual for 24 weeks.\nThe primary outcome measures are quality of life of people with dementia assessed by the QoL-AD and cognition\nassessed by the ADAS-Cog. Secondary outcomes include the person with dementia's mood, behaviour, activities of\ndaily living, ability to communicate and costs; as well as caregiver health-related quality of life. Using a 5%\nsignificance level, comparison of 230 participants will yield 80% power to detect a standardised difference of 0.39 on\nthe ADAS-Cog between the groups. The trial includes a cost-effectiveness analysis from a public sector perspective.\nDiscussion: A pilot study of longer-term Maintenance CST, offering 16 weekly sessions of maintenance following the \ninitial CST programme, previously found a significant improvement in cognitive function (MMSE) for those on the \nintervention group. The study identified the need for a large-scale, multi-centre RCT to define the potential longer-\nterm benefits of continuing the therapy. This study aims to provide definitive evidence of the potential efficacy of \nmaintenance CST and establish how far the long-term benefits can be compared with antidementia drugs such as \ncholinesterase inhibitors.\nTrial Registration: ISRCTN26286067\nBackground\nPsychological treatments for dementia such as Reality\nOrientation (RO) and Reminiscence have been in use for\nnearly half a century, and are widely used in the UK and\ninternationally, but often have not been standardised,\nadequately evaluated or systematically implemented. A\nnumber of systematic reviews of psychosocial interven-\ntions are now available [1-3], as well as a number of\nCochrane reviews of specific approaches [e.g. [4,5]]. The\nSpector review of RO [5] was used to develop a seven-\nweek evidence-based Cognitive Stimulation Therapy\n(CST) programme for people with dementia [6]. A total\nof 201 people with dementia were recruited for this sin-\n* Correspondence: e.aguirre@ucl.ac.uk\n1 Department of Mental Health Sciences, University College London, Charles \nBell House, 67-73 Riding House Street, London, UK\n\u2020 Contributed equally\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the articleBioMed Central\n\u00a9 2010 Aguirre et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

The CST group\nimproved significantly on the main outcome measures\n(cognition and quality of life). CST compared favourably\nwith cholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease in\nterms of numbers needed to treat (NNT) [6] and the eco-\nnomic analysis showed that CST was likely to be cost-\neffective [7]. The recent UK guidelines on dementia [8]\nrecommend that all people with mild\/moderate dementia\nshould be 'given the opportunity to participate in a struc-\ntured group cognitive stimulation programme'.\nThe evidence for the long-term effects of CST is less\nconclusive. Feedback from the CST training and previous\nstudies [6] suggested that service users preferred a lon-\nger-term programme after the seven-week CST interven-\ntion. A number of studies have looked at the longer-term\neffects of cognitive stimulation and related interventions.\nA recent pilot study of longer-term CST (maintenance\nCST) [9], offering 16 weekly sessions of maintenance, fol-\nlowing the initial CST programme, found a significant\nimprovement in cognitive function (MMSE) for those\nreceiving ongoing Maintenance CST. This lasted nearly 6\nmonths in comparison to a group of CST only and con-\ntrols (p = 0.012). The study identified the need for a large-\nscale, multi-centre RCT to define the potential longer-\nterm benefits of MCST for dementia. A number of other\nstudies have looked at the longer-term effects of cognitive\nstimulation and related interventions in combination\nwith cholinesterase inhibitors. Two recent RCTs found\nthat over 6 months, cognitive stimulation and cholinest-\nerase inhibitors in combination, were more effective than\ncholinesterase inhibitors alone [10,11]. There is a distinct\noverlap between what is described as Reality Orientation\n(RO) and Cognitive Stimulation. Both programmes often\ndescribe similar features, whilst more emphasis is placed\non re-learning orientation information in RO, Cognitive\nStimulation focuses on implicit information processing.\nStudies have suggested that with a RO intervention, the\ncognitive benefits gained were lost after 10 weeks [12]\nand one month [13] after stopping the programme. How-\never, Wallis et al. [13] found that behavioural functioning\ncontinued to improve 10 weeks after the RO programme\nterminated. Other studies have suggested that longer pro-\ngrammes of RO may have longer-term effects [14,15].\nZanetti et al. [14], found, in a RCT, that the effect of RO\non cognitive performance appeared to counteract the\ndecline, observed in the control group, of 2.58 points on\nthe MMSE. Similarly Metitieri et al. [15] found that peo-\nple receiving long-term treatment declined in cognitive\nfunction significantly later, and remained at home longer\nthan those receiving a shorter programme of RO. Both\nstudies concluded that providing a longer term RO inter-\nvention was effective in slowing, at least temporarily, the\ndementia process. A novel aspect of the Zanetti et al\nstudy [14] was that they described an expected yearly\ndecrease in Mini-Mental-State-Examination score [16] of\n1.8-4.2 points in people with dementia. Therefore, it\nmight be that pre-post comparisons in the studies which\nhad used longer interventions (20 and 21 weeks) would\nhave shown weaker results [17,18] as a result of the\nexpected yearly decrease.\nIt is unclear how far maintenance programmes of CST\nmight continue to benefit the participants. The studies\nincluded in the recent CST Cochrane review [19] ranged\nfrom using programmes of four weeks [20] to one year\n[21]. However, no relationship between the duration of\nthe intervention and the outcome was shown. The trials\nwith the strongest results and higher weight in the meta-\nnalyses [6,11] had 7 to 25 weeks of intervention respec-\ntively. Stronger evidence of their effectiveness is needed\nto support the long-term implementation of CST. It is\nalso necessary to examine whether the combination of\nMaintenance CST with cholinesterase inhibitors for\nAlzheimer's disease is cost-effective and brings extra\nlong-term benefits to cognition and quality of life of peo-\nple with dementia. This paper describes the study proto-\ncol for a pragmatic RCT of CST versus CST followed by a\n24 week maintenance CST programme undertaken with\npeople experiencing mild to moderate dementia. This\nresearch programme aims to provide essential evidence\nto clarify the role of long-term CST interventions alone\nand in combination with cholinesterase inhibitors and\nthe analyses of its cost-effectiveness.\nMethods\/Design\nThe design is a single-blind, multi-centre, randomized\ncontrolled trial of Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST)\ngroups for dementia vs. Maintenance CST groups (extra\n24 sessions once a week) (Figure 1). After completion of\nthe initial CST programme (twice weekly, 45-minute ses-\nsions for 7 weeks), participants are randomly allocated\ninto treatment group (maintenance sessions once a week\nfor 24 weeks) or control group (treatment as usual for 24\nweeks).\nPeople with Alzheimers disease are offered cholinest-\nerase inhibitors by their local clinical team provided that\nthey are willing and eligible (according to NICE guide-\nlines [8]) for the medication. People currently on cholin-\nesterase inhibitors will continue taking them. Participants\nenter the study after giving signed informed consent in\naccordance with the provisions of the Mental Capacity\nAct 2005. Ethical approval was obtained through the\nMulti-centre Research Ethics Committee (ref no. 08\/\nH0702\/68). The clinical trial is registered - ISRCTN\n26286067.\nAguirre et al.

Trials 2010, 11:46\nhttp:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/11\/1\/46\nPage 4 of 10Participants\nRecruitment to this trial is currently taking place through\nday centres, residential homes and Community Mental\nHealth Teams (CMHTs) in the participating study cen-\ntres, with at least a minimum of 14 potential participants.\nHalf of the sample to be recruited from the community\n(50%) and the other half of the sample (50%) from care\nhomes. Potential centres (day centres, CMHTs and resi-\ndential homes) are screened for eligibility to determine\nwhether there are sufficient numbers of potential partici-\npants with dementia, using the inclusion criteria flow\nchart. (Appendix 1). People with dementia meeting the\ninclusion criteria are recruited into the two CST groups\nthat are running per centre (7 to 10 per group).\nRandomisation\nThe randomisation process in this trial is undertaken in\ntwo stages, randomisation 1 and randomisation 2. Figure\n1 sets out the two-stage randomisation process. The allo-\ncation ratio at randomisation 1 stage is 1:1; into either\ngroup A or group B, with both groups receiving 7 weeks\nof CST. The allocation ratio at randomisation 2 stage is\n1:1; into either the control group or treatment group. The\nsample is stratified to ensure that equal numbers of par-\nticipants taking cholinesterase inhibitors are randomised\ninto either the Maintenance CST or the control group.\nThe North Wales Organisation for Randomised Trials in\nHealth (NWORTH) is responsible for undertaking the\nremote randomisation. NWORTH is accredited as a Clin-\nical Trials Unit by the UK Clinical Research Collabora-\ntion (UKCRC) and funded as part of the Clinical\nResearch Collaboration Cymru, notably for HTA trials.\nBlinding\nAlthough participants cannot be blinded to their allo-\ncated treatment, all follow-up data is gathered by inter-\nviewers blind to groups. However our experience in the\nCST trial, as shared by similar projects, is that partici-\npants may occasionally and inadvertently inform\nresearchers of the treatment they are receiving. We aim\nto reduce this effect by giving explicit reminders to par-\nticipants before the assessment visit and by the use of\nself-report measures wherever feasible. Assessors record\ntheir impression of which arm of the trial each partici-\npant belongs to and their confidence in that prediction on\ncompletion of the two follow up assessments. This\nenables us to test whether inadvertent loss of blinding\nleads to bias, and to adjust for any bias that may be\ndetected.\nIntervention\nCST is an intervention for people with mild to moderate\ndementia, designed following extensive evaluation of the\navailable research and is an evidence-based treatment [6].\nThe programme consists of fourteen 45-minute sessions\nwhich are run twice weekly. Each session incorporates\nuse of an 'RO board', displaying both personal and orien-\ntation information, including the group name (as chosen\nby participants). The guiding principles of CST involve\nusing new ideas, thoughts and associations; using orien-\ntation (but sensitively and implicitly); a focus on opinions\nrather than facts; using reminiscence as an aid to the\nhere-and-now; providing triggers to aid recall; creation of\ncontinuity and consistency between sessions; focus on\nimplicit (rather than explicit) learning; stimulating lan-\nguage; stimulating executive functioning and being per-\nson-centred -(treating people as unique individuals with\ntheir own personality and preferences). The CST pro-\ngramme aims to create an environment where people\nhave fun, learn and where they strengthen their abilities\nand relationships among the group members, thus main-\ntaining their social and cognitive skills at their optimum\nability.\nThe Maintenance Cognitive Stimulation Therapy\n(CST) programme is an evidence-based maintenance\ngroup therapy programme for people with dementia. It\ncomprises a programme of 24 sessions of maintenance\nCST, based on the theoretical concepts of RO\/Cognitive\nStimulation and grounded on the original CST pro-\ngramme. The programme has been developed as part of\nthe Support at Home - Interventions to Enhance Life in\nDementia (SHIELD) research programme. The aim is to\ncreate an evidence-based maintenance group therapy\nprogramme for people with dementia based on the same\nprinciples as the CST programme. A process of several\ndifferent methodological approaches has been used to\ndevelop the maintenance CST programme. This includes\nusing the preliminary findings of a feasibility study into\nmaintenance CST [9] and data extracted from the\nupdated Cochrane review on cognitive stimulation for\npeople with dementia [19]. Consultation was achieved\nwith identified experts in the field, interested academics,\nclinicians and service users, through holding a consensus\nworkshop and focus groups with people with dementia,\nfamily caregivers and members of staff working directly\nwith people with dementia [22]. A summary of the CST\nand maintenance CST programme can be found in Table\n1.\nRecruitment and training of facilitators\nEach CST and maintenance CST group has two facilita-\ntors, one from the research team and a co-facilitator who\nis a member of staff from the recruited centre (e.g. care\nhome). The facilitators have at least one year of experi-\nence in dementia care. Main facilitators often have a\nmental health nursing, occupational therapy or clinical\npsychology background, experience in dementia care and\ngroup facilitation skills. The use of two facilitators for\neach group enables effective de-briefing and reflection to\nAguirre et al.

All facilitators attend a\none-day CST training developed by one of the CST pio-\nneers (AS) as part of the dissemination strategy. The\ntraining provides a detailed background and description\nof CST, and uses learning methods including group\nobservation, role-playing and small group exercise.\nUsual Care\nThe participants allocated to the control group receive\ntreatment as usual. This can vary between and within\ncentres and may change over time, but in principle, the\ninterventions offered to this group are also available to\nthose in the active treatment groups. Therefore, the trial\nexamines the additional effects of maintenance CST. Our\napproach to costing the services and interventions\nreceived will allow us to monitor whether the treatment-\nas-usual group have been receiving similar therapeutic\ninterventions. Use of antidementia medication is\nrecorded as part of the costing information collected. It is\npossible that participants in the treatment-as-usual group\nare involved in some form of cognitive stimulation work\nduring the 24 weeks of the study period. However, it is\nvery unlikely that such a structured approach to CST is\noffered in any of the centres. It is this systematic group-\nbased approach that is the focus of this evaluation.\nEthical arrangements\nRisks and anticipated benefits for trial participants \nThere appear to be no documented harmful side-effects\nfrom participating in CST groups, and no serious adverse\nreactions were apparent in the CST study. Benefits are\nconsistently reported by participants in the groups,\nincluding enjoyment, feelings of validation and self-worth\n[23]. The inclination of participants to continue meeting\nfollowing the sessions provides an indication of the value\nplaced on the benefits. Prospective participants are fully\ninformed of the potential risks and benefits of the project.\nA reporting procedure is in place to ensure that serious\nadverse events are reported to the Chief Investigator\n(MO). Upon becoming aware of an adverse event involv-\ning a participant or carer, a senior clinical member of the\nresearch team assesses its seriousness. A Serious Adverse\nEvent (SAE) is defined in the trial as an untoward occur-\nrence experienced by either a participant or carer which:\n\u2022 results in death;\n\u2022 is life threatening;\n\u2022 requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing\nhospitalisation;\n\u2022 results in persistent or significant disability or inca-\npacity;\n\u2022 is otherwise considered medically significant by the\ninvestigator;\n\u2022 falls within the scope of the Protection of Vulnerable\nAdults (POVA) protocol which is in place to ensure that\nsuspected cases of abuse or neglect are followed-up in an\nappropriate manner.\nA reporting form is submitted to the CI who assesses\nwhether the SAE is related to the conduct of the trial and\nis unexpected. SAEs that are judged to be related and\nunexpected are reported to MREC and the trial DMEC.\nConsent\nRecruited participants are in the mild to moderate stages\nof dementia, and would therefore generally be expected\nto be competent to give informed consent for participa-\ntion, provided that appropriate care is taken in explaining\nthe research and sufficient time allowed for them to reach\na decision. Wherever possible a family member or other\nsupporter is included. It is made clear to participants and\nfamily care-givers that no disadvantage will occur if they\nchoose not to participate. In seeking consent, we follow\ncurrent guidance from the British Psychological Society\non evaluation of capacity. In this context, consent has to\nbe regarded as a continuing process rather than a one-off\ndecision, and willingness to continue participating will be\ncontinually checked through discussion with participants\nduring the assessments. Where the participant's level of\nimpairment increases, so that they are no longer able to\nprovide informed consent, the provisions of the Mental\nCapacity Act 2005 [24] will be followed. The initial giving\nof informed consent can provide an indication of the per-\nson's preference for participation in the research, and the\nfamily care-giver's viewpoint can also be sought. If the\nperson with dementia shows discomfort at any point with\nthe assessments they can be discontinued.\nOutcome measures\nPrimary and secondary measures are completed at base-\nline (T0), after the seven weeks of the CST programme\n(first follow up, T1), three months after beginning of the\nmaintenance groups (second follow-up T2) and six\nmonths after the beginning of the maintenance groups\n(third follow up and primary end-point T3).\nPrimary outcome measures\na) Cognition is measured using the ADAS-Cog [25]. The\nADAS-Cog consists of 11 tasks measuring the distur-\nbances of memory, language, praxis, attention and other\ncognitive abilities which are often referred to as the core\nsymptoms of AD.\nb) Quality of life is measured using the Quality of Life--\nAlzheimer's disease Scale [26]. The QOL-AD covers 13\ndomains of quality of life. It has good internal consis-\ntency, validity and reliability and its use is recommended\nby the European consensus on outcome measures for\npsychosocial interventions in dementia [27].\nSecondary Outcomes\na) Cognition using the Mini-Mental State Examination\n(MMSE), [16]. The MMSE is a brief, widely used test of\ncognitive function, with good reliability and validity.\nb) Communication is assessed using the Holden Com-\nmunication Scale [28]. This scale is completed by staff or\nAguirre et al. Trials 2010, 11:46\nhttp:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/11\/1\/46\nPage 7 of 10family caregivers and covers a range of social behaviour\nand communication variables.\nc) Depression is assessed using the Cornell Scale for\nDepression in Dementia [29]. This scale rates depression\nin five broad categories using information from inter-\nviews with staff and participants. Good reliability and\nvalidity have been demonstrated.\nd) Anxiety is assessed using the Rating Anxiety in\nDementia scale [30] (RAID). This rates anxiety in four\nmain categories and uses interviews with staff and partic-\nipants. It has good validity and reliability.\ne) Behaviour is assessed using the Neuropsychiatric\nInventory (NPI) [31]. The NPI assess 10 behavioural dis-\nturbances occurring in dementia patients. Studies report\nthat it has good validity and reliability.\nf ) Activities of daily living assessed using the\nAlzheimer's Disease Co-operative Study - Activities of\nDaily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL) [32]. The ADCS-\nADL is a structured questionnaire originally created to\nassess functional capacity over the range of dementia\nseverity. The sensitivity and reliability have been establish\n[32].\ng) Family Caregiver health is assessed using the Short\nForm-12 Health Survey (SF-12) [33]. This scale measures\ngeneric health concepts relevant across age, disease, and\ntreatment groups. The SF-12 includes 8 concepts com-\nmonly represented in health surveys. It is a self adminis-\ntrative measure that provides a comprehensive,\npsychometrically sound, and efficient way to measure\nhealth from the patient's point of view by scoring stan-\ndardized responses to standard questions. This measure\nis only used when a family caregiver is available from the\ncommunity sample participants.\nh) Costs are assessed using the validated Client Services\nReceipt Inventory (CSRI) [34], adapted for this study.\nUsed extensively in studies of mental health and demen-\ntia [7], the CSRI gathers comprehensive data on accom-\nmodation, medication and services received. In this trial\nthe data will cover the previous three months (at baseline\nand after treatment) or at three and six months follow-up.\nUnit costs are then attached to services and support\nreceived, based on nationally relevant estimates of long-\nrun marginal opportunity costs. Two quality of life mea-\nsures are also included for cost utility analyses. The EQ-\n5D [35] is a standardised instrument for use as a measure\nof health-related quality of life. It contains a 3-level cod-\ning system for 5 dimensions. The instrument includes a\nglobal rating of current health using a visual analog scale.\nThe DEMQOL [36] uses self-rated reports of QoL\nadministered by a trained interviewer; there is also a sep-\narate scale for family caregiver or members of staff\nreports, the DEMQOL-proxy. It includes 5 domains of\nquality of life. The DEMQOL has high internal consis-\ntency and acceptable inter-rater reliability and indicates\nconcurrent validity through moderate associations with\nthe QOL-AD and DEMQOL [36].\nSample Size\nThe primary outcome measures are cognition (ADAS-\nCog) and quality of life (QoL-AD) at 24 weeks follow up.\nIn the pilot CST trial [6] which recruited people with\nmild\/moderate dementia (MMSE 10-24), community and\ninstitutional participants had a similar level of cognitive\nimpairment (mean MMSE 14.5 and 14.1). The RO review\n[5] found a moderate effect size of 0.58 between the RO\nand control groups though the studies had some differ-\nences in methodology, outcome measures, and length of\ntreatment\/follow up. The MCST pilot study found a large\neffect size of 1.0 compared with CST alone. To detect an\neffect size for MCST of 0.39 on the ADASCog with power\nof 80% using a 5% significance level and an estimated\nattrition of 15% needed, a sample size of 230 at T1 is\nrequired. If an estimated 60 participants will have\nAlzheimer's disease and are suitable\/willing to take cho-\nlinesterase inhibitors (ACHEIs), this provides sufficient\nnumbers for the maintenance CST\/ACHEIs trial plat-\nform to estimate effect size and the feasibility of the trial.\nAnalyses\nStatistical analyses of effectiveness\nAnalysis will be by intention to treat, in that all available\ndata will be included. Methods of imputation such as\nLOCF (last observation carried forward) are of limited\nutility in dementia, where the expectation is decline for\nthe usual treatment group, and participants will be lost\nthrough death and illness. Hence our sample size calcula-\ntions are based on the numbers estimated to be available\nat the study end-point, 6 months after randomisation to\neither the CST only group or the maintenance CST\ngroup. Multi-level modelling will be used to address the\nissue of clustering within randomised groups. We shall\nalso use analysis of covariance to adjust for baseline dif-\nferences in outcome variables [37]. Analyses will consider\nthe evaluation 6 months after the second randomisation\nas the primary end-point. Secondary analyses will con-\nsider the effects immediately following the CST, at 3 and\n6 months. Age, gender, cholinesterase inhibitor and base-\nline scores on the scales being examined will be entered\nas covariates, together with 'centre' entered as a random\nfactor, because treatment has been defined as participa-\ntion in the group programme within the confines of the\ncentres.\nEconomic evaluation\nThe primary economic evaluation is a cost-effectiveness\nanalysis. This study also offers an opportunity to conduct\na secondary cost-utility analysis. In addition, all costs and\neffects for people with dementia will be set out in a cost-\nconsequence analysis. This analysis takes a public sector\nperspective spanning the NHS (dementia services, pri-\nmary and secondary care) and social care services funded\nAguirre et al.

The interventions\nreceived will be fully costed from the perspective of local\ndementia services to generate a total programme cost and\ncost per participant. We will estimate costs from data col-\nlected in the validated Client Service Receipt Inventory\n(CSRI), completed with the family care-giver or care\nhome manager. Costs will include those associated with\nthe CST and maintenance CST groups, primary and sec-\nondary health care services used by participants in the\nintervention and control arms of the study (e.g. home\/\nsurgery telephone contacts with GP and practice nurse,\noutpatient and inpatient attendances at secondary care,\nprescribing), home care, residential care placements, care\nand support accessed through direct payments (or per-\nsonal budgets), as well as indirect costs associated with\ncaregiver time and lost productivity.\nIncremental Cost-effectiveness Analysis\nThe incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) measures\na ratio of costs to outcomes, with the denominator being\nthe difference in costs between the intervention and con-\ntrol groups, and the numerator being the difference\nbetween these groups in an outcome measure. The pri-\nmary analysis will compute the ICER for each of the pri-\nmary outcomes in turn (ADAS-Cog, QOL-AD).\nSecondary analyses will measure outcomes using utility\nscores generated by the EQ5D and DEMQOL. Bootstrap\ncalculations, will be used for examining the uncertainty in\nthe cost-effectiveness analysis, to provide an estimate of\nthe probability distribution of the ICER, its confidence\ninterval, or variance in the ratio.\nWe will plot cost-effectiveness acceptability curves\n(CEACs), which have been widely adopted as a method to\nquantify and graphically represent uncertainty in eco-\nnomic evaluation studies of health care technologies.\nThey can equally be used in the evaluation of public\nhealth interventions. Sensitivity analysis will be under-\ntaken to test whether plausible changes in the values of\nthe main variables affect the results of the analysis.\nCost-consequence analysis is a variant of cost-effective-\nness analysis in which the components of incremental\ncosts and consequences (health outcomes) of alternative\nprogrammes are listed without aggregation. This analysis\nwill be used for a comparison of secondary outcome mea-\nsures of participants in the intervention and control arms\nof the study. The inclusion of a cost-consequence analysis\nin addition to the standard cost-effectiveness and cost-\nutility analyses is to set out transparently the full range of\ncosts and consequences resulting from CST so as to assist\ncommissioners and policy makers responsible for funding\nand coordinating services.\nDiscussion\nThis innovative and pragmatic RCT that evaluates the\neffectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a maintenance\nCST programme for dementia constitutes one of the larg-\nest and longest trials for people with dementia and one of\nthe first including an integrated cost-effective analysis of\na psychosocial intervention. This study reflects the cur-\nrent emphasis on improving cognition and quality of life\nusing psychosocial interventions, and the emphasis is on\nworking under a person-centred framework through\ngroup exercises aiming at global stimulation of cognitive\nabilities for a prolonged period of time. The NICE-SCIE\nguidelines [8] on the management of dementia offer few\nevidence-based recommendations about psychosocial\napproaches. This is mainly due to the lack of high-quality\nstudies showing their efficacy and lack of specific guid-\nance for the duration that psychosocial interventions\nshould be provided. The results of this trial may therefore\ncontribute to future practice guidelines and, if successful,\nwill help the widespread use of psychosocial interven-\ntions in dementia care such as CST within health and\nsocial care services [38]. CST has now been evaluated in a\nnumber of countries [21,39,40] and the UK National\nAudit Office report highlighted that CST was available in\n29% of community mental health teams for older people\n[41].\nThis study should provide definitive evidence of the\npotential efficacy of maintenance CST and establish how\nfar the long-term efficacy can be compared with antide-\nmentia drugs such as cholinesterase inhibitors in terms of\ncognition and quality of life. The results of this study,\nboth in terms of efficacy and cost-effectiveness, are likely\nto influence the availability and provision of maintenance\nCST in the UK and internationally, and will also impact\non evidence-based guidelines and strategic policies in\ndementia care.\nAppendix 1\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nInclusion criteria\nAll participants are people with dementia who:\n\u0002 meet the DSM-IV criteria for dementia of any type,\nincluding Alzheimer's, vascular, Lewy Body type and\nmixed\n\u0002 are in the mild to moderate stage of dementia (Clinical\nDementia Rating)\n\u0002 can communicate and understand communication in\nEnglish\n\u0002 can engage in group activity for at least 45 minutes\nExclusion criteria\nParticipants do not have any characteristic which could\naffect participation, e.g.: major physical illness; sensory\nimpairment; disability or high level of agitation.\nCompeting interests\nAS runs the CST training course on a commercial basis.\nAS, BW and MO have co-authored a CST manual, the royalties from which are\nreceived by the Dementia Services Development Centre Wales.\nAguirre et al.
