This note provides evidence on the validity and reliability of \ncross-national environmental surveys \u2014 an aspect that has not found much \nattention so far. Methods. Validity can be checked in examining whether \ncross-national differences in environmental attitudes are in accordance with \ntheoretical hypotheses. For example, a study can claim some validity if con-\ncern about inadequate sanitation is strongly negatively correlated to the ac-\ntual extent of access to sanitation in a country. Results. Several validity \nchecks were undertaken for the Gallup et al. (1993) survey, all of which tend \nto support its validity. Next, the reliability of cross-national environmental \nsurveys was checked. Both Pearson and Spearman rank correlations were \nrun for similar questions from differing studies. Most correlations are low \nand statistically insignificant, however, thus putting some doubt on the reli-\nability of cross-national environmental surveys, at least with respect to the \nquestions examined. Conclusions. The findings support the validity of cross-\nnational environmental surveys, but not their reliability.  Future surveys \nshould be designed such that validity and reliability checks become easier to \nundertake. \n \nSome time ago, this journal served as a forum for a fierce debate about what \ndetermines differences in international environmental attitudes (see SSQ, \nVol. 78, Number 1, March 1997). The debate was triggered by Brechin and \nKempton\u2019s (1994) and Dunlap and Mertig\u2019s (1995) critique of the \u2018postmate-\nrialism thesis\u2019 for explaining \u2018global environmentalism\u2019 as well as Kidd and \nLee\u2019s (1997) counter-critique and defense of the theory that environmental \n2 \nconcern is strongly correlated with postmaterialist values. I have nothing to \nadd to this debate. Instead, this short note is concerned with another issue \nthat was raised by Brechin and Kempton (1994: pp. 260f.), but did not find \nany subsequent attention: the validity and reliability of cross-national survey \ndata with respect to the environment.1 \nBrechin and Kempton (1994: p. 260) rightly ask the question whether data \nfrom cross-national environmental surveys \u2018can be truly comparable across \ndiverse languages and nations. That is, even after checking the survey ques-\ntionnaire via back-translation, how comparable are the cultural contexts in \nwhich the questions are interpreted, and how comparable are the meanings \nof the resulting answers?\u2019. Given the absence of ethnographic studies and \npre-tests, they propose to examine whether \u2018existing independent evidence \n(...) supports the validity of answers to the environmental questions.\u2019 They \ngo on presenting some very casual observations on \n\u2022 forestry being a high-profile issue in West Germany and Norway, in ac-\ncordance with citizens of these countries being strongly concerned about \nworld forest issues. \n\u2022 citizens from Chile and Uruguay being more concerned about ozone de-\npletion than any other global environmental problem, in accordance with \nthese countries being nearer the Antarctic and thus more exposed to in-\ncreased ultraviolet radiation due to ozone layer depletion. \n\u2022 the local ecology being impoverished in Saudi Arabia, in accordance with \nthe low environmental concern among Saudi Arabians. \n3 \n\u2022 and finally on the growth in grass roots environmental groups in the \nThird World, in accordance with high developing-country environmental-\nism. \nInterestingly, Inglehart (1995), the major proponent of the \u2018postmaterialist \nthesis\u2019 under attack from Brechin and Kempton (1994), puts forward argu-\nments in a similar vein \u2014 without explicitly intending to corroborate the \nvalidity of cross-national surveys, however. Inglehart reports some casual \nevidence on the seriousness of environmental problems in developing and \nEastern European countries, which he links to high approval rates for the \necology movement in these countries. More systematically, Inglehart (1995: \np. 68) constructs an index of pollution levels (which is in effect an index of \nurban air pollution) and a measure of the extent of postmaterialist values \nheld by citizens of a country. His multiple classification analysis finds that \nboth variables strongly impact upon support for environmental protection \nas measured by a composite index constructed by Inglehart from results of \nthe 1990-93 World Values Survey (Inglehart, Basanez and Moreno, 1998). \nFurthermore, Bloom (1995) observes that individuals in developing coun-\ntries express stronger concern over local environmental problems, which he \nregards as consistent with \u2018comparisons of objective measures of environ-\nmental quality between developing and industrial countries\u2019, without offer-\ning any systematic evidence or statistical testing, however. \nUnfortunately, both Brechin and Kempton\u2019s (1994) explicit and Inglehart\u2019s \n(1995) as well as Bloom\u2019s (1995) implicit attempt to verify the validity of \ncross-national environmental survey data are deficient in at least two re-\n4 \nspects: first, mostly very casual, instead of systematic empirical evidence is \nused. Apparently, Inglehart\u2019s pollution index analysis is an exception. It suf-\nfers from a second kind of deficiency, however, which is that it addresses the \nwrong type of questions to test for validity. Given that Inglehart\u2019s pollution \nindex is effectively an index of urban air pollution from mostly one or two \ncities in each country and nothing else, he should have looked for correla-\ntion with concern about local air pollution in these same cities. Unfortu-\nnately, the data base he uses is not apt for such a test because only very \nbroad and general questions on support for environmental protection are \nasked in this survey. Similarly, Brechin and Kempton\u2019s attempt, for example, \nto link national forestry issues in West Germany and Norway with concern \nof their citizens about world forest issues is not very convincing as national \nconcern need not extend to the global level. \n \nChecking for validity \nInstead what we need are validity checks using hypotheses for which we \nhave strong a priori expectations from theoretical reasoning and using sys-\ntematic data instead of casual observations. Unfortunately, of the four major \ninternational surveys, which include questions concerning the environment \n\u2014 Louis Harris and Associates (1989), Gallup et al. (1993), World Values \nSurvey (Inglehart, Basanez and Moreno, 1998) and International Social Sur-\nvey Programme (Frizzell and Pammett, 1997) \u2014 only Gallup et al. (1993) \nasks questions that are appropriate for such validity checks. The Louis Har-\nris and Associates (1989) survey asks a few questions about the seriousness \n5 \nof environmental problems that would be amenable for validity checks if \nthey clearly focused on the interviewee\u2019s country of origin. Unfortunately, it \nasks for whether a specific environmental degradation presents a problem \n\u2018in this country or in other countries such as this around the world\u2019 (my empha-\nsis). As mentioned, the World Values Survey only provides very broad and \ngeneral data on support for environmental protection. It asks only few ques-\ntions on the environment and the ones it asks are too broad and unfocused \nfor validity tests. The environmental module of the International Social Sur-\nvey Programme (ISSP) asks many more questions on the environment. \nHowever, it mainly asks questions about what people believe about the en-\nvironment and the extent of their knowledge about ecological facts. \nThe Gallup et al. (1993) survey, on the other hand, asks many questions \nabout environmental concern, causes of environmental degradation and \nsupport for environmental measures.2 For a few of these questions we have \ngood theoretical hypotheses. For example, the survey asks for concern about \nspecified local (as opposed to global) environmental problems. We would \nexpect that the extent of this specific concern is clearly linked to objective \nconditions in a country with respect to this aspect of the environment. We \nwould not expect that this link is perfect, as many factors presumably affect \nconcern about local environmental problems. But we could give interna-\ntional data some validity if people express greater concern about local envi-\nronmental problems if they are actually faced with more severe environ-\nmental problems. Alternatively, given the often spurious existence of good \ndata on these conditions we would expect a clear link of local environmental \n6 \nconcern to levels of income, either because local environmental problems \nbecome ameliorated with higher income levels (see Neumayer, 1999: pp. 77-\n79) or because richer people are better able to defend themselves against en-\nvironmental nuisances. Again, we would not expect a perfect relationship, \nhowever. Also, this hypothesis does not rule out that individuals from rich \ncountries are as much concerned as poor individuals about the environment \nmore generally, as their concern might stem from more global environ-\nmental problems (see again the debate in SSQ, Vol. 78, Number 1, March \n1997). \nINSERT TABLE 1 HERE \nTable 1 presents evidence for an environmental problem for which we \nhave relatively good data: access to sanitation. Gallup et al. (1993) asked for \nthe seriousness of inadequate sanitation in the local community. As can be \nseen from table 1, concern about inadequate sanitation is strongly negatively \ncorrelated to the extent of access individuals have to sanitation. The correla-\ntion is statistically significant at the .01 level. Similarly, Gallup et al. (1993) \nasked for the seriousness of air, water and noise pollution in the local com-\nmunity. For these types of pollution, there do not exist good, representative \nand comparable international data, however. As a substitute, per capita in-\ncome in purchasing power parity was correlated against concern for local \nair, water and noise pollution. As can be seen from table 1, all three correla-\ntions are negative as expected and highly statistically significant. What is \ntrue for specific local environmental problems also applies to the state of the \nnational environment more generally. Gallup et al. (1993) asked individuals \n7 \nto rate the national environmental quality. Again, there does not exist an \naggregate index of a country\u2019s objective environmental conditions, so that \nper capita income was correlated against this variable. Table 1 shows that \nthis correlation is also negative as expected and is statistically significant at \nthe .05 level. \nGallup et al. (1993) also asked two questions on overpopulation. One asks \nfor the seriousness of overpopulation in the local community, the other one \nfor the contribution of overpopulation to the nation\u2019s environmental prob-\nlems. We would expect approval of these questions to be clearly correlated \nto population growth rates. Table 2 presents the evidence. As can be seen, \npopulation growth rates are very strongly correlated with both of these \nvariables and both correlations are statistically significant at the .001 level. \nINSERT TABLE 2 HERE \nAdditonally, Gallup et al. (1993) asked a number of further questions on \nwhich factors contribute to the nation\u2019s environmental problems. Of these \nquestions two are amenable for validity checks: the first one asks for \nwhether the interviewee thinks that a lack of education contributes a \u2018great \ndeal\u2019 to the nation\u2019s environmental problems. We would expect approval of \nthis question to be strongly negatively correlated to an index of educational \nattainment in each country. The second question asks for the contribution of \ngovernment to a nation\u2019s environmental problems. We would expect ap-\nproving answers to this question to be clearly negatively correlated to the \nextent of political freedom in a country. This is because the more autocratic \nand the less accountable a political system is the more likely it is that a coun-\n8 \ntry\u2019s government is perceived as a major contributor to environmental deg-\nradation. We would expect a similar link to the perceived extent of corrup-\ntion among public servants. The evidence is given in table 3. As can be seen \nthe perceived contribution of a lack of education is strongly negatively cor-\nrelated with an index of educational attainment within a country and sig-\nnificantly so at the .01 level. The perceived contribution of government to a \nnation\u2019s environmental problems is very strongly negatively correlated and \nvery significantly so to the extent of political freedom within a country. A \nsimilar, but positive, correlation exists with the perceived corruption of its \ncivil servants. All these results are encouraging and comforting as they sup-\nport the presumption that the validity of cross-national environmental sur-\nvey data, at least for the Gallup et al. (1993) study, are not severely ham-\npered by cultural differences or language barriers. In order to check more \nsystematically for validity, it would be helpful if all future studies included a \nnumber of questions that are easily amenable for validity checks. \nINSERT TABLE 3 HERE \n \nChecking for reliability \nApart from testing the validity of international environmental survey data in \nchecking the consistency of data with strong theoretical hypotheses, one can \nalso test for reliability of data coming from different studies. If various stud-\nies asked very similar questions and we find that the answers to these ques-\ntions are strongly correlated with each other or at least that the ranking of \ncountries is strongly correlated for similar questions, then we could give \n9 \nthese studies some more credibility than we would in the absence of such a \ncorrelation.  \nUnfortunately, to perform such a test is not easy, for three reasons: first, \nquestions asked in differing studies are hardly ever the same or very similar; \nsecond, the number and range of countries in which surveys are conducted \nusually differs from study to study; and third, existing studies are usually \nundertaken in different years and asymmetric changes in the countries un-\nder investigation could have changed the attitudes of citizens towards envi-\nronmental questions. As we will see shortly, for the existing studies the first \naspect presents a severe problem, the second aspect decreases the number of \nobservations, whereas the third aspect is negligible as all studies have been \nundertaken in the late 1980s and early 1990s. \nThe only questions across the various studies that are sufficiently similar \nare those asking for the interviewee\u2019s willingness to pay either higher prices \nor taxes for environmental protection. Table 4 presents the concrete wording \nof the questions together with the correlation results. 3 The only correlations \nthat, even if rather low, are at least statistically significant at the .05 level are \nthe Pearson correlation and Spearman rank correlation for the Gallup et al. \n(1993) study and the World Values Survey. Ironically, however, Gallup et al. \n(1993) asked for the willingness to pay higher prices, whereas the World \nValues Survey asked for the willingness to pay higher taxes. \nINSERT TABLE 4 HERE \nAll other correlations are statistically insignificant. These results are \nrather discomforting, but their implications are not altogether clear. It would \n10 \nbe premature to conclude that these studies are unreliable as the concrete \nwording of the questions could be responsible for the failure of statistically \nsignificant correlation. On the other hand, what these results do imply is that \none cannot rely either on the concrete approval rates or on the ranking of \ncountries from any single study as they are likely to be extremely sensitive \nto the concrete wording of a question. This holds true at least for the ques-\ntions examined here and it severely restricts the usefulness of data from one \nstudy. In order to more systematically test for the reliability of studies, it \nwould be helpful if future studies included a number of questions that are \nidentical in their wording to former studies. Tests for reliability and inter-\nstudies consistency could then more adequately be undertaken. \n \nReferences \nBloom, David E., 1995. \u201cInternational Public Opinion on the Environment\u201c \nScience 269: 354-8. \nBrechin, Steven R. and Willet Kempton, 1994. \u201cGlobal Environmentalism: A \nChallenge to the Postmaterialism Thesis?\u201d Social Science Quarterly 75: 245\u2013\n69. \nDunlap, Riley E. and Angela G.

Given that we do not know \nthe \u2018true\u2019 attitudes of respondents, the only way to check validity is to examine whether the \nanswers given are consistent with strong theoretical hypotheses. Reliability refers here to the \nconsistency of data coming from different surveys (comparative reliability). \n2 The study was undertaken in 1992 comprising 12 developed and 12 developing countries. \n3 The Louis Harris and Associates (1989) study is not taken into account here for two rea-\nsons. First, contrary to the other three studies its interviewees are not drawn from a repre-\nsentative sample of a country. Second, the range of countries in this study is quite different \nfrom the other three studies, so that the number of observations would become very low. \n"}
