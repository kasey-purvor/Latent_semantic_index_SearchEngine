A number of observational studies have reported \na connection between various lower atmospheric parameters \nand a range of geomagnetic and solar coronal indices. The \nbulk of the Sun's magnetised plasma energy is absorbed in \nthe high-latitude upper atmosphere, far removed from the \ntroposphere and the stratosphere, so a physical mechanism \nwhich accounts for these correlations has proved elusive. In \nthis paper, a mechanistic three-dimensional model of the \natmosphere between 10 and 130 km has been developed to \ndemonstrate that high energy particles from the solar wind \ncan perturb the winter stratosphere significantly. Planetary \nwaves provide an effective means of coupling solar-induced \nchanges in the thermosphere down to the stratosphere. A \nqualitatively similar response to forcing by increasing solar \nultraviolet radiation was obtained even though there was no \nin situ forcing in the stratosphere. \nIntroduction \nChapman and Ferraro [1931] were the first to postulate \nthe existence of a stream of ionized particles, ejected from \nthe Sun and interacting with the Earth's atmosphere, to \nexplain the occurrence of aurorae and other related distur- \nbances. Most of the plasma that enters the Earth's mag- \nnetosphere is directed along magnetic field lines into the \npolar regions where it is deposited in the ionosphere and \nsubsequently the thermosphere (for a review refer to Cow- \nley [1996]). There is evidence to suggest that the atmosphere \nbelow 90 km responds to solar coronal activity. For example, \nan examination of over one hundred crossings of the hello- \nspheric current sheet by the Earth by Wilcox et al. [1973] \nproduced significant reductions in the area of winter time \ntroughs at 500 mb. \nPudovkin and Veretenenko [1995] and $vensmark and \nFriis-Christensen [1997] have noted a change in the cloud \ncover that is related to the solar wind. They proposed a \nmodulation of incoming galactic cosmic ray flux to bring \nabout the requisite atmospheric changes. Tinsley and Heelis \n[1993] have suggested that solar wind induced changes in the \nglobal atmosphere-ionosphere circuit would affect the rate \nof initial ice nucleation via electro-scavenging. Variations in \nthe cloud cover would then affect the radiation budget and \nlatent heat release with implications for the general circula- \ntion. \nEvidence for dynamic processes enhancing the atmo- \nspheric response to solar irradiance variability was presented \nby Labitzke and Van Loon [1988]. They pointed out that \nCopyright 2001 by the American Geophysical Union. \nPaper number 2000GL012825. \n0094-8276\/01\/2000GL012825 $05.00 \nthe combination of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation and ir- \nradiance changes resulted in an enhanced response in the \nwinter stratosphere. Kodera et al. [1991] modeled this suc- \ncessfully, albeit using exaggerated levels of ultraviolet heat- \ning. Bochn(Sek et al. [1999] used 40 years of global sur- \nface parameters to detect a significant QBO\/geomagnetic \nactivity dependence. In contrast to ultraviolet heating, the \nin situ forcing of the lower atmosphere by solar particles \nis negligible. Additional amplification could be obtained \nthrough ozone feedback (Haigh [1994] and Balachandran et \nal. [1995]) and through coupling with the upper mesosphere \nand thermosphere (Arnold and Robinson [1998]). \nTo assess the contribution from dynamic activity via \nplanetary wave coupling with the upper atmosphere a num- \nber of numerical simulations were carried out using a model \nof the middle atmosphere and lower thermosphere under a \nrange of geomagnetic conditions. The impact on the winter \nstratosphere was examined. \nDescription of the coupled middle and \nupper atmosphere model and the \nexperimental procedures \nPlanetary scale Rossby waves play an important role in \nmaintaining the winter stratospheric circulation (for a re- \nview see for example Geller [1993]). To investigate the dy- \nnamical coupling with the thermosphere, an extended ver- \nsion of the UK Meteorological Offrice Stratosphere Meso- \nsphere Model has been developed (Arnold and Robinson \n[1998, 2000]). The version used in this paper has sixty five \nvertical levels at a resolution of four per scale height. \nTo avoid the ditficulties associated with simulating the \ncomplex processes in the upper atmosphere, such as non- \nLocal Thermodynamic Equilibrium and heating from par- \nticle precipitation, linear relaxation to the empirical MSIS- \n90E temperature model (Hedin [1991]) was adopted. De- \ntailed infra-red radiative transfer calculations were carried \nout between 10 and 70 km at eight equally spaced longi- \ntudes every three hours using the scheme developed by Shine \n[1987]. In the Northern Hemisphere winter, large amplitude \nplanetary waves regularly displace the eastward motion of \nthe circulation, resulting in significant errors if zonally av- \neraged temperatures are used. \nThe Stratospheric Sounding Unit, (Miller et al. [1980]), \nprovided observations to derive realistic, vertically propagat- \ning planetary waves at a lower boundary of 314 mb between \n1st December 1992 and 28th February 1993. The appro- \npriate solar minimum flux rates for this time of year were \nselected for both sets of experiments described in this paper. \nThe initial conditions were obtained from MSIS and the Hor- \nizontal Wind Model (Hedin et al. [1993]). The model was \nstepped forward in time at 90 second intervals for 90 days. \n2381 \n2382 ARNOLD AND ROBINSON- GEOMAGNETIC INFLUENCES ON THE STRATOSPHERE \nlOO \n90S 60S 30S EQ 30N 60N 90N \nLatitude \nAT \n4.0 \n3.0 \n2.0 \n1.0 \n0.0 \n-1.0 \n-2.0 \n-3.0 \n100 ' \u00df ' ' * \n80 \ng 60 \n\u2022' 40 \n20 \n0 20 40 \nDoys from 1\/8\/92 \n60 80 1 oo \nFigure 1. 10 day mean zonally averaged temperature differ- \nences (\u00f8K) after 75 model days derived from the best fit to 10 \nconstant Ap experiments ranging in value from i to 61. \nFigure 3.

To generate an ensemble of \nruns, the time series of Ap values were multiplied by scaling \nfactors between geomagnetically quiet and active conditions. \nLeast squares fitting of each atmospheric parameter and Ap \nprovided a quantitative estimate of the response to external \nforcing and the level of internal variability. \nResults from the steady geomagnetic \nforcing experiment \nWithin MSIS, the atmospheric response to magnetic flux \nchanges above 90 km can be prescribed via the Ap index. \nin the first series of ten simulations, a range of constant Ap \nvalues evenly spaced between i and 60 was chosen with the \nformer representing extremely quiet conditions whilst the \nlatter was applicable to strongly disturbed conditions. This \nexperiment most closely resembles the study by Arnold and \nRobinson [2000] where constant F10.7 cm fluxes between \nsolar minimum and solar maximum levels were employed. \nlOO \n80 \nE 6O \n._\u2022 \n3:40 \n20 \n90 S 60 S 30 S EQ 30 N 60 N \nLatitude \n90 N \nAm\/s \n6.0 \n4.0 \n....... :2.0 \n:-\"---\"----':..--:..-:\u2022j:\u2022 o.o \n....... \n*::*::'\u2022 -2.0 \n........ :....: \n.:!::a:: -4.0 \n-6.0 \n-8.0 \nFigure 2.

Transport processes contribute a significant frac- \ntion of the heating in this region as levels of direct solar \nirradiance are low. The cooling of the winter polar strato- \nsphere indicated that meridional transport was being inhib- \nited by increased forcing in the lower thermosphere. In the \nsummer hemisphere, planetary waves tend to be prevented \nfrom propagating from the troposphere into the stratosphere \nagainst a background of westward flow conditions (Charney \nand Drazin [1961]). Without planetary wave forcing, the \ncoupling between the stratosphere and the lower thermo- \nsphere is very weak (Arnold and Robinson [1998]). \nHolton [1994] had postulated that the combination of the \nQuasi-Biennial Oscillation and the modulating influence of \nsolar heating by ultraviolet radiation in the middle atmo- \nsphere might induce a change of the circulation in the win- \nlOO \n80 \n\u2022 60 \n3:40 \n20 \n90S 60S 30S EQ 30N 60N 90N \nLatitude \nAT \n3.0 \n2.2 \n1.4 \n0.6 \n. \u2022 :\u2022...-:.;--..--:\u2022:.\u2022: \n............ -0 2 \n-2.6 \n-3.4 \nFigure 4.

The polar vortex in the winter stratosphere \nprovides a mechanism for positive feedback between radia- \ntive and dynamical processes. Any stratospheric cooling re- \nsults in the intensification of the latitudinal thermal gradi- \nent that in turn enhances the upper air jets. Stronger jets \nreduce the ability of planetary waves to mix mid- and high- \nlatitude air masses (see for example Mcintyre [1987]) and so \nthe sunlight-poor vortex cools further. Arnold and Robinson \n[1998] demonstrated that planetary waves from the tropo- \nsphere could be redirected by changes in the thermosphere \nand the response of the stratosphere amplified by this effect. \nThe high latitude Northern Hemisphere jet experienced \nsignificant acceleration when the geomagnetic activity was \nenhanced. The zonal mean zonal wind increase approached \n7 ms -1 at close to 40 \u00f8N (figure 2). This represented a sig- \nnificant fraction of the upper atmosphere jet strength whose \npeak was typically 60-80 ms -1. The close proximity of the \nwind enhancement in the Northern Hemisphere to the direct \nforcing region provided an indication that the latter was in- \nfluencing the wave-mean flow interactions in the mesosphere \nthat ultimately propagated down into the stratosphere. A \nlesser deceleration of the mean flow was generated at equa- \ntorial latitudes to conserve angular momentum. When the \nappropriate Quasi-Biennial Oscillation forcing is active, it is \nconceivable that the process can either be amplified or a re- \nversal of the flow pattern sustained (see for example, Kodera \net al. [1991]). \nAn assessment of the correlation coefficients generated \nfor each zonally averaged temperature within the model con- \nfirmed the dominance of the direct forcing above 80 km and \na complex response pattern at lower altitudes. A signifi- \ncance above the 95 % threshold was achieved in the lower \nstratosphere between 30 \u00f8N and 60 \u00f8S, although the heating \ninvolved was barely discernible. The cooling region in the \nwinter stratosphere was both significant and of large ampli- \ntude. \nZonally averaged quantities are not always the best in- \ndicators of changes in the circulation. Constant pressure \ncross-sections of the best-fit temperature differences revealed \nconsiderable planetary wave structure in the geomagneti- \ncally induced perturbations in the winter stratosphere. As \nthe winter stratospheric vortex was often disturbed and \ndisplaced from the pole by planetary waves, the extent of \nthe external forcing was partially obscured using zonally \naveraged output. The difference fields themselves exhib- \nited wave-like structures highlighting the contribution being \nmade by planetary waves to the winter climatology. There \nwas a warmer region during this ten day period over South- \nern Europe during active geomagnetic conditions indicating \nthat the global response to external forcing need not be uni- \nform. \nConclusion \nResults from variable geomagnetic \nforcing experiments \nTransient, non-linear and non-conservative phenomena \nplay an important role in driving the underlying circulation \nof the middle atmosphere (Andrews and Mcintyre [1978]). \nTherefore, rapidly varying thermospheric conditions asso- \nciated with geomagnetic activity can have a significance \ngreater than that from the seasonally averaged activity lev- \nels. Once the middle atmosphere has been modified, further \ninternal coupling between the circulation and the waves can \namplify the process as discussed in the previous section and \nirreversibly alter the evolution of the atmosphere. \nEpisodes of intense fluctuations in Ap can occur on a \ntime scale of just of few days, usually associated with geo- \nmagnetic storms. As the winter of 1992\/3 was geomagnet- \nically uneventful, an adjacent three month interval starting \non August 1st, 1992 was selected instead for a series of daily \nvalues to be fed into the MSIS reference field (figure 3). A \nseries of intense geomagnetic storms would now occur in the \nsame month as winter stratospheric warming events in the \nNorthern Hemisphere. The model simulation used the same \nlower boundary forcing data and seasonal irradiance levels \nas the previous experiments. \nThe variable geomagnetic forcing scenario generated per- \nturbations in the winter polar stratosphere temperature (fig- \nure 4) whose amplitude was comparable to that of the previ- \nous experiment, even though the time averaged Ap was con- \nsiderably lower (=18.3). The morphological similarity be- \ntween the results from this and the previous experiment in- \ndicated that the precise details of the original thermospheric \nforcing mechanism were of only secondary importance. One \npossible explanation for this is that transport time scales \nin the thermosphere are much shorter than those associated \nwith planetary waves. \nCorpuscular emissions from the Sun are able to enter \nthe Earth's upper atmosphere, especially at high latitudes \nand can bring about significant heating of the lower ther- \nmosphere. In addition, strong ionospheric convection cur- \nrents are generated that accelerate the neutral atmosphere \nthrough friction. The resulting changes to the climatology \nof the lower thermosphere modify the propagation of waves \ntravelling upwards from the lower atmosphere. In the cur- \nrent paper, we have investigated the role that planetary \nwaves play in coupling the middle and upper atmospheric \nresponse to geomagnetic activity related changes. \nUsing physically plausible levels of solar and planetary \nwave activity sustained over the Northern Hemisphere win- \nter period, the extent of the stratospheric response was \nfound to be comparable to that achieved in an earlier study \nthat considered ultraviolet flux variations between solar min- \nimum and solar maximum conditions. In the latter case, \nsignificant amounts of energy were being input directly into \nthe stratosphere, whereas in the case of geomagnetic activity \nchanges, the in situ contribution was negligible. Two ensem- \nbles of experiments were performed to enhance the statisti- \ncal robustness of the results. The global lower thermosphere \nadjusted rapidly to relatively localised forcing near the mag- \nnetic poles, compared to the time scales of the planetary \nwave disturbances. Therefore, the stratospheric response \nwas qualitatively similar to that obtained by ultraviolet ra- \ndiation, even though the latter heating occurred in a differ- \nent region of the atmosphere. \nAcknowledgments.
