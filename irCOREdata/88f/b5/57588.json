Liasidium variabile is a zonal index for the Late Sinemurian in \nnorthwest Europe, and this occurrence allows a correlation to the Oxynotum Zone of \nthis substage.

This interpretation is \nnot consistent with a hiatus within the Upper Sinemurian succession on Raasay. \n \n \nIntroduction \n \n The Jurassic outcrops of western Scotland are the most northwesterly in \nBritain, and are exposed from the Shiant Isles in the north to Mull in the south (Riding \net al. 1991; Morton and Hudson 1995). They occur in westerly-tilted fault blocks in a \nmajor half-graben structure that is one of a system of basins on the margins of the \nNorth Atlantic formed during early extensional phases of the Atlantic Ocean (Morton \n1992). Southwest Raasay is situated on a small block, approximately 10 km wide, \nwhich is bound to the west by the Screapadal Fault, and to the east by the Applecross \nFault (Mellere and Steele 1996). The Jurassic strata have been intruded by Palaeogene \nbasalts and granites. \n 2\n The Lower and Middle Jurassic strata of southwest Raasay have been \npreserved largely due to an overlying sheet of intrusive granophyre, which has caused \nlimited thermal alteration to this succession. The strata are Hettangian to Late \nBajocian in age and the succession is approximately 600 m thick (Cope, Duff et al. \n1980; Cope, Getty et al. 1980; Cox and Sumbler 2002; Simms et al. 2004). It \ncomprises six formations which are, in ascending stratigraphical order, the Breakish \nFormation, the Ardnish Formation, the Pabay Shale Formation, the Scalpay Sandstone \nFormation, the Portree Shale Formation, the Raasay Ironstone Formation and the \nBearreraig Sandstone Formation (Lee 1920; Howarth 1956; Morton 1965; 1976; \nGetty 1973; Page 1992; Morton and Hudson 1995; Hesselbo et al. 1998; Morton \n1999a, b; Cox and Sumbler 2002; Fig. 1). This study is on the palynology and the \nstratigraphical implications of two samples from the lower part of the Pabay Shale \nFormation in Suisinish, southwest Raasay (Fig. 2). In this paper, the zones and \nsubzones are treated as chronostratigraphical subdivisions of stages. They are given \nthe name of the respective ammonite species and written with an initial capital and in \nRoman font (Cox and Sumbler, 2002, p. 6). \n \n \nPrevious Research \n \n The Pabay Shale Formation crops out in various locations in the Inner \nHebrides, notably along the east coasts of Skye and Raasay (Morton and Hudson \n1995; Hesselbo et al. 1998, fig. 3). Most of the previous biostratigraphy on the Pabay \nShale Formation of Raasay has been done on the succession at Hallaig on the east \ncoast of the island. Ammonite faunas indicate that the Pabay Shale Formation in the \nSkye area is Sinemurian to Pleinsbachian in age, ranging from the Semicostatum \nZone (Lyra Subzone) to the ?Middle Ibex Zone (?Valdani Subzone) (Hesselbo et al. \n1998, figs. 3, 12, 13). However not all of the ammonite-based zones and subzones \nhave been recorded and the absence of much of the Upper Sinemurian, notably the \nObtusum and Oxynotum zones, was noted by Oates (1978) and Hesselbo et al. (1998, \nfig. 3). This was thought to be due to outcrops being obscured by landslip. Hesselbo et \nal. (1998, p. 38, 39) also observed that, in southwest Raasay, \u201cThe Oxynotum zone is \nunconfirmed but is likely also to be present\u201d. Other authors, such as Richey (1961) \n 3\nand Sellwood (1972), have however suggested there may be a non-sequence in the \nLate Sinemurian succession on Raasay. \n Previous studies on the Jurassic palynology of the Hebrides Basin include \nBradshaw and Fenton (1982), Riding (1984, 1992a), Riding et al. (1991) and Riding \nand Thomas (1997). This report represents the first palynological evidence for Upper \nSinemurian strata in the Hebrides Basin. \n \n \nPalynology \n \n Two dark grey mudstone samples, JMB1 and JMB2, were collected for \npalynological analysis from the Pabay Shale Formation in Suisinish, southwest \nRaasay. These samples were collected from an extensive outcrop of a uniform \nparallel-laminated black shale at Grid References [NG 55353 34600] and [NG 55198 \n35026], respectively (Fig. 3). The bed sampled has been intruded by numerous \nPalaeogene basalt dykes, and is capped by the Raasay Granite. \n The samples were processed using standard palynological laboratory \ntechniques which comprised digestion using hydrochloric acid and 49% hydrofluoric \nacid followed by oxidation with Schultze\u2019s solution and sieving using a 10 \u03bcm mesh \nto concentrate the 11 to 200 \u03bcm fraction (Wood et al., 1996). The raw organic \nresidues from both samples were dark brown to black in colour. This relatively high \nlevel of thermal maturity is due to the proximity of the basalt dykes and the Raasay \nGranite. Hence they were oxidised using Schultze\u2019s solution for 5 to 6 hours to render \nthe palynomorphs sufficiently light for study. \n The two samples yielded abundant organic particulate matter, mainly \nterrestrially-derived plant fragments, pollen and spores with relatively low proportions \nof marine microplankton (acritarchs and dinoflagellate cysts). Both samples proved \nrelatively low in palynomorph diversity. Sample JMB1 was the richest, with 11 \nspecies of gymnosperm pollen and pteridophyte spores recorded. These miospores \ncomprise Cerebropollenites macroverrucosus (Thiergart 1949) Schulz 1967, \nClassopollis classoides (Pflug 1953) Pocock & Jansonius 1961, Cyathidites minor \nCouper 1953, Gleicheniidites senonicus Ross 1949, Ischyosporites variegatus \n(Couper 1958) Schulz 1967, Osmundacidites wellmanii Couper 1958, \nPerinopollenites elatoides Couper 1958, Podocarpidites spp., Protopinus scanicus \n 4\nNilsson 1958, Retitriletes austroclavatidites (Cookson 1953) D\u00f6ring et al. 1963 and \nTodisporites major Couper 1958. These taxa are all relatively long ranging, however \nthe absence of the characteristic pollen genus Callialasporites is indicative of an Early \nJurassic age (Riding et al., 1991). \n Marine palynomorphs comprise 5-8% of the palynomorph assemblages. These \nare overwhelmingly dominated by the dinoflagellate cyst Liasidium variabile Drugg \n1978 and small acanthomorphic (spine-bearing) acritarchs referable to Micrhystridium \n(Fig. 4). Liasidium variabile is the most biostratigraphically significant palynomorph \nin the entire microflora. This species is confined to the Late Sinemurian of northwest \nEurope. Bucefalo Palliani and Riding (2000, fig. 5A,B) recognised two morphotypes \nof this taxon from North Yorkshire. Morphotype A is characterised by relatively short \npolar horns, whereas Morphotype B is distinguished by a prominent apical horn, a \nrounded left antapical protuberance and a pronounced right lateral \u2018shoulder\u2019 on the \nhypocyst. In the two Pabay Shale Formation samples, both morphotypes of Liasidium \nvariabile were recorded, although Morphotype A is significantly more common than \nMorphotype B. However, Morbey (1978) and Van de Schootbrugge et al. (2005, p. \n82) observed more than two discernible morphotypes of Liasidium variabile. A \nsystematic treatment of Liasidium and Liasidium variabile is presented as Appendix \n1. \n \n \nBiostratigraphy \n \n The previously recorded stratigraphical ranges for Liasidium variabile are \npresented in Fig. 5; the total reported range is Hettangian to Early Pliensbachian. The \noldest recorded occurrences are Hettangian by Brenner (1986) from southwest \nGermany and Rauscher and Schmitt (1990) from northeast France. Both these studies \nare not based on samples correlated to ammonite zones. Likewise, there are two \nrecords from the Pliensbachian Stage; these are Fauconnier (1995) and Williams et al. \n(1990). The report of Fauconnier (1995) is from a borehole drilled in northeast France \nand the range top is apparently within the earliest Pliensbachian Jamesoni Zone. \nWilliams et al. (1990) represents the first non-European report of Liasidium variabile.  \nThe species was identified from four wells in the Scotian Basin, offshore eastern \n 5\nCanada; there is no explanation of the Late Sinemurian-Early Pliensbachian age \nassigned to the Liasidium variabile Zone of Williams et al. (1990, fig. 3.8). \n As is evident from Fig. 5, the overwhelming majority of records of this species \nare from the Late Sinemurian (for example Woollam and Riding, 1983; Feist-\nBurkhardt and Wille, 1992; Poulsen, 1996; Lund, 2003). Furthermore the Late \nSinemurian records with ammonite control indicate that the majority of these \noccurrences are centred on the Oxynotum Zone (both the Simpsoni and Oxynotum \nsubzones). The key records from the Oxynotum Zone are Drugg (1978), Riding \n(1987), Dybkj\u00e6r (1988) and unpublished data. These unpublished data are records of \nLiasidium variabile from two British Geological Survey cored boreholes drilled in \neastern England. These are the Cockle Pits Borehole, east Yorkshire ([NGR SE 9323 \n2865]; see Gaunt et al., 1980) and the Copper Hill Borehole ([NGR SK 9787 4265]; \nsee Berridge et al., 1999). Abundant Liasidium variabile were recorded at 57.32 m, \nwithin the Oxynotum Zone, in the Cockle Pits Borehole (Woollam and Riding, 1983, \np. 25). In the Copper Hill Borehole, Liasidium variabile was found in significant \nproportions (up to 17.4% of the palynoflora at 177.00 m) in 11 samples from the \nBrant Mudstone Formation, all of which are referable to the Oxynotum Zone between \n182.00 to 172.00 m (Riding, 1992b). \n Weiss (1986) recorded Liasidium variabile from the Lower\/Upper Sinemurian \nboundary beds (Turneri and Obtusum zones) in Germany. Other reports from the \nObtusum Zone include Riding (1987), Bucefalo Palliani and Riding (2000) from \neastern England and Van de Schootbrugge et al. (2005) from west Wales. Despite the \nrelatively restricted range of Liasidium variabile, the spread of records is interesting \nand may represent differing recovery of ammonites and\/or the quality of ammonite \ninterpretations. \n Bucefalo Palliani and Riding (2000) found that Liasidium variabile \nMorphotype A, with short polar horns, first appears in the Late Sinemurian Obtusum \nZone (Denotatus Subzone) and extends into the overlying Simpsoni Subzone of the \nOxynotum Zone. By contrast Liasidium variabile Morphotype B, with a prominent \napical horn, is typically confined to the Oxynotum Subzone (Bucefalo Palliani & \nRiding 2000, p. 5, 10). Hence, the presence of Liasidium variabile morphotypes A \nand B in the two samples from Raasay indicates that this part of the Pabay Shale \nFormation is of Late Sinemurian age and referable to the Oxynotum Zone (and \nprobably the Oxynotum Subzone). \n 6\n \n \nConclusions \n \n The prominent occurrence of the dinoflagellate cyst Liasidium variabile \nwithin a thermally-mature palynomorph association in the Pabay Shale Formation of \nsouthwest Raasay is the first record of this biostratigraphically important Late \nSinemurian species in Scotland. This record unequivocally confirms the presence of \nUpper Sinemurian strata within the Pabay Shale Formation in the southwest part of \nRaasay. This occurrence is strongly indicative of the Oxynotum Zone, and the \npresence of Liasidium variabile morphotypes A and B strongly suggests the \nOxynotum Subzone of the Oxynotum Zone. The Oxynotum Zone has not previously \nbeen identified on Raasay. The presence of the Upper Sinemurian is not consistent \nwith the Late Sinemurian hiatus on Raasay proposed by Richey (1961) and Sellwood \n(1972). \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \n We gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Mary Lehane for laboratory \npreparation of the samples.

It is part of a relatively low-diversity plexus of apparently \nrelatively primitive genera which characterise the Mid-Late Triassic and Early-earliest \nMid Jurassic interval. These forms preceded the major evolutionary radiation of the \nOrder Gonyaulacales which started during the Bajocian Stage of the Mid Jurassic \n(Fensome et al., 1996, fig. 1). The characteristic biconical shape of Liasidium and the \npresence of polar horns are similar to those of Mid-Late Triassic genera such as \nHeibergella Bujak & Fisher 1976, Rhaetogonyaulax Sarjeant 1966 emend. Below \n1987 and Sverdrupiella Bujak & Fisher 1976. Drugg (1978, p. 70) remarked that \nLiasidium appears to have peridiniinean affinities, probably due to the prominent \nanterior intercalary archaeopyle. Bujak and Davies (1983, p. 56, fig. 22) and Evitt \n(1985) also commented that the genus may be one of the earliest representatives of the \nperidinioid lineage. Below (1987, p. 128, fig. 68a,b) also discussed this question and \ninterpreted the shape of the type I2a archaeopyle as heptagonal. The shape of the \narchaeopyle (i.e. the 2a plate) is hence not typical of the Family Peridiniaceae \n 16\nEhrenberg 1831 because it has a geniculate anterior margin. Below (1987, p. 128) \ncommented that, because of this, Liasidium appears to be closely related to \nRhaetogonyaulax. \n Van de Schootbrugge et al. (2005) commented that the presence of younger \ngenera of the Family Heterocapsaceae such as Parvocysta Bjaerke 1980 and \nReutlingia Drugg 1978 emend. Below 1987 in the Toarcian-Aalenian. Liasidium was \nthus considered by these authors to be a \u2018missing link\u2019 between the Mid-Late Triassic \nand latest Early-earliest Mid Jurassic Rhaetogonyaulax and Parvocysta\/Susadinium \nsuites respectively. Van de Schootbrugge et al. (2007) commented on the severe \nextinction of dinoflagellate cysts at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. The presence of \nabundant Liasidium variabile in the late Sinemurian, during the Hettangian to late \nPliensbachian interval which was otherwise largely devoid of dinoflagellate cysts, is \nintriguing. It is possible that it was an opportunistic taxon which thrived briefly, \nperhaps in response to a major palaeoecological event. It is also possible that \nLiasidium variabile may have been a heterotrophic species (S. Feist-Burkhardt, \npersonal communication, 2009), and hence was adapted to particular nutritional \ncircumstances. \n Van de Schootbrugge et al. (2005, p. 87-88) speculated that Liasidium was \nassociated with late sea level highstands, and that this genus migrated from the \npalaeo-Pacific into the Tethys during the Late Sinemurian as a result of changes in \nocean circulation. This is consistent with the interpretation of Liasidium variabile as a \nwarm water taxon by Riding and Hubbard (1999). However, there are no reports of \nthis species from the palaeo-Pacific region, except for the unsubstantiated occurrence \nof cf. Liasidium variabile from the Lower Jurassic of Mexico by Rueda-Gaxiola et al. \n(1999). \n \nSpecies Liasidium variabile Drugg 1979 (Fig. 4.1-4.12) \n \nFull synonymy: \n1978 Liasidium variabile Drugg, p. 69, 70, pl. 4, fig. 10, pl. 5, figs 1-9. \n1978 \u201cLiassogonyaulax complexa\u201d Morbey, figs. 2.2-2.12, pl. 1, figs. 10-29. \n1978 Dinoflagellate sp. 2 Morbey and Dunay, pl. 1, figs. 7-13. \n1983 Liasidium variabile Drugg 1978.

In the above synonymy list, all the previous illustrated records of Liasidium \nvariabile are listed in chronological order. This species has also been reported, but not \nfigured by, for example, Riding and Sarjeant (1985), Ainsworth et al. (1987; 1989), \nWilliams et al. (1990), Feist Burkhardt and Wille (1992), Partington et al. (1993), \nFeist Burkhardt (1994), Fauconnier (1995; 1997), Poulsen & Riding (2003) and Van \nde Schootbrugge et al. (2005). Liasidium variabile has been reported from the \nHettangian to the Early Pliensbachian of Europe (Denmark, England, France, \nGermany, offshore Ireland and Wales) and offshore eastern Canada. The numerous \nrecords of this species, however, indicate that it is normally confined to the Late \nSinemurian (Oxynotum Zone) (Fig. 5). The report of this form from the Toarcian of \nRomania by Moldovanu (1987) is not substantiated. A specimen of Liasidium \nvariabile reworked into Late Devensian (Late Quaternary) glaciolacustrine sediments \nof Norfolk was illustrated by Riding et al.
