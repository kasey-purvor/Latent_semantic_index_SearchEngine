As supply chains become more\ncomplex as a result of global sourcing and the continued trend to \u2018leaning-down\u2019,\nsupply chain risk increases. The challenge to business today is to manage and\nmitigate that risk through creating more resilient supply chains.\nSupply chain managers strive to achieve the ideals of fully integrated efficient and\neffective supply chains, capable of creating and sustaining competitive advantage\n[1]. To this end they must balance downward cost pressures and the need for\nefficiency, with effective means to manage the demands of market-driven service\nrequirements and the known risks of routine supply chain failures. Better\nmanagement and control of internal processes together with more open information\nflows within and between organisations can do much to help.\nHowever, in an age of lengthening supply chains serving globe-spanning operations,\nrecent events around the world have provided frequent reminders that we live in an\nunpredictable and changing world [2]. Natural disasters, industrial disputes,\nterrorism, not to mention the spectre of war in the Middle East, have all resulted in\nserious disruptions to supply chain activities. In these situations \u2018business as usual\u2019\nis often not an option.\nModern commercial supply chains are in fact dynamic networks of interconnected\nfirms and industries [3]. No organisation is an island and even the most carefully\ncontrolled processes are still only as good as the links and nodes that support them.\n2All are dependent on efficient and reliable transportation and communication\nsystems, an obvious point, but one that is often overlooked [4].\nThese issues are the subject of the Centre for Logistics and Supply Chain\nManagement\u2019s on-going programme of research into supply chain risk and\nvulnerability. The work presented in this paper forms part of the wider body of\nresearch, funded by the UK\u2019s Department for Transport, which aimed to increase\nthe resilience of economic activity to all manner of potential threats [5].\nThis paper reports on some of the findings and recommendations of the second\nstage of that programme. The work is empirically based and draws on insights from\na number of important industries including food retailing, oil and petrochemicals,\npharmaceutical, packaging, electronics, transport services and the distribution of\nautomotive spares. It also includes input from private and public sector\norganisations involved in the provision of health care and in defense. In particular it\nfocuses on the development of a managerial agenda for the identification and\nmanagement of supply chain risk, with recommendations to improve the resilience\nof supply chains.\nSupply Chain Resilience\nWhen working effectively and efficiently modern supply chains allow goods to be\nproduced and delivered in the right quantities, to the right places, at the right time\nin a cost effective manner. Until recently the term \u2018supply chain\u2019 was not widely\nused beyond the confines of academia, specialist sectors of industry and the\nprofessional management community. Now, in the wake of a number of far-\nreaching supply chain disruptions to economic activity it has crossed over into the\neveryday vocabulary of politicians, general managers and the wider public.\nThe term \u2018supply chain\u2019 is itself a relatively new addition to the lexicon of\nmanagement, first used in the early 1980s when writers coined the phrase to\ndescribe an emerging management discipline [6]. This new discipline was a\n3response to changes in prevailing trends in business strategy, which in turn\ndemanded that internal functional self-interests be put aside to achieve a greater\ngood \u2013 a more efficient organisation, creating and delivering better value to\ncustomers and shareholders. It amounted to a redefinition and amalgamation of\nestablished business activities, notably \u2018logistics\u2019 (integrated transport,\nwarehousing, and distribution) and manufacturing-based \u2018operations management\u2019.\nThe latter drew together elements of purchasing, order and inventory management,\nproduction planning and control, plus customer service.\nIn the 1990s - the efficiency driven age of \u2018business process reengineering\u2019 - supply\nchain management sought to speed the flow of goods and services by extending the\nintegration of elements of logistics, operations management and marketing into\ncross-functional inter-organisational processes. Its avowed aim was to improve the\nefficiency of product flows from the production of raw materials all the way through\nto the marketplace where finished goods were delivered to the final consumer. The\ntask was increasingly enabled by rapid developments in information technology,\nwhich in turn opened the way for further improvements in efficiency and greater\nawareness of a changing marketplace and emerging customer requirements.\nIn practice legacies of functional biases within organisations, together with varying\nperspectives of specialist firms mean that the term \u2018supply chain\u2019 continues to imply\ndifferent things to different people. It is still frequently used to describe either the\nmanagement of integrated manufacturing and\/or logistics activities within a single\nfirm\u2019s manufacturing, transport, distribution or retail network. It is also regularly\napplied (particularly in the context of purchasing) to describe the management and\nperformance monitoring of an organisation\u2019s supplier base, through quality\nimprovement initiatives, involvement in new product introductions, promotions and\noverall cost reduction.\nFor the purpose of this paper we adopt an end-to-end perspective of the flows of\nproduct and accompanying information from the source of raw materials to delivery\nto the end customer and sometimes beyond (i.e. after-sales support and where\n4necessary return). We therefore define a supply chain as: \u201cthe network of\norganizations that are involved, through upstream and downstream linkages, in the\ndifferent processes and activities that produce value in the form of products and\nservices in the hands of the ultimate consumer\u201d [7]. The notion of networks is\nparticularly important and its relevance to this study will become apparent\nthroughout this paper, but the key point is that modern supply chains are not\nsimply linear chains or processes. They are complex networks. The products and\ninformation flows travel within and between nodes in a variety of networks that link\norganisations, industries and economies.\nIn defining other key terms in this paper we have veered away from hotly disputed\nacademic definitions and sought where possible to align ourselves with appropriate\nand widely accepted dictionary definitions [8]. We have also taken care to avoid\nsome of the pit-falls of synonyms, in particular we distinguish between \u2018resilience\u2019\nand \u2018robustness\u2019. In practice the two terms are used interchangeably, but in the\ncontext of supply chains they can acquire quite different connotations. To aid\nclarity in our thinking we have adopted the following dictionary derived definitions.\nWe have taken \u2018robust\u2019 to mean \u2018strong or sturdy in physique or construction\u2019.\nHere the emphasis is on physical strength. In IT terminology \u2018robustness\u2019 is \u2018the\nability of a computer system to cope with errors during execution\u2019. A robust\nprocess may be desirable, but does not itself equate to a resilient supply chain.\nWe are using the term \u2018resilience\u2019 as it relates to supply chains as networks, so\nhave adopted a dictionary-based definition that is rooted in the science of eco-\nsystems. We define resilience as \u2018the ability of a system to return to its original\nstate or move to a new, more desirable state after being disturbed\u2019. Implicit in this\ndefinition is the notion of flexibility, and given that the desired state may be\ndifferent from the original, \u2018adaptability\u2019 earns a place in our thinking too.\nThe final term we must deal with at this stage is potentially the most problematic\nof all. It is \u2018risk\u2019. There are many different interpretations of risk in the academic\nliterature. Amongst the most widely cited are variance-based definitions drawn\nfrom classical decision theory, where risk is the \u2018variation in the distribution of\n5possible outcomes, their likelihoods and their subjective values\u2019; or the hazard-\nfocussed interpretation, common in risk management, which is more likely to\npresent risk in terms of: \u2018Risk = Probability (of a given event) x Severity (negative\nbusiness impact)\u2019 [9]. In this work we use risk in line with common usage in the\nsense that it relates to supply chain vulnerability, as \u2018at risk: vulnerable; likely to\nbe lost or damaged\u2019.\nGiven the interdependencies between organisations and their supply chains, it may\nbe the business that is at risk from its supply chain or the supply chain that is at\nrisk from a business. The predicament of Land Rover, a subsidiary of Ford, in\nJanuary 2002 illustrates this point.\nWhen chassis manufacturer UPF-Thompson became insolvent at the end of 2001,\nthe impact upon its major customer was sudden and severe. UPF was the sole\nsupplier of chassis for the Land Rover\u2019s best-selling model, the Discovery. The\nreceivers, KPMG, threatened to halt supply unless Land Rover made an immediate\nup-front payment of between \u00a335 and \u00a340 million. KPMG justified its actions by\npointing out that it was legally obliged to recover money on behalf of its creditors\nand the sole supplier agreement represented a valuable asset. The action followed\nan earlier court ruling in the UK that had determined that receivers were legally\nentitled to exploit a customer\u2019s vulnerability for the benefit of creditors. Land\nRover faced the very real possibility of having to shut down production of the\nDiscovery until a temporary injunction was secured granting the car-maker a short-\nterm reprieve. The injunction allowed Land Rover to arrange for another supplier\nto acquire the failing business, averting the lay-off of 1400 Land Rover workers and\nmany more amongst the car maker\u2019s network of suppliers.\nThat supply chain was actually at risk because of the failure of UPF\u2019s business, not\ndirectly due to a problem between the supplier and its automotive industry\ncustomers, but as a result of losses suffered by UPF in an unrelated but ill-starred\nforeign venture.\n6Previous Research\nSupply chain resilience is a new and still largely unexplored area of management\nresearch, though one that is currently in the ascendancy. This research follows on\nfrom an exploratory study of Supply Chain Vulnerability by the Centre for Logistics\nand Supply Chain Management, undertaken in 2001 on behalf of the UK\ngovernment\u2019s Department for Transport, Department of Trade and Industry (DTi)\nand The Home Office. The impetus for the study was the widespread economic\ndisruption experienced in the UK by fuel protests in September 2000 and the\noutbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease in February 2001. The work was already well\nunderway by the time of the terrorist attacks on the USA on 11th September 2001,\nthough these events demonstrated the timeliness and relevance of the work.\nThe aim of the first study was to ascertain the state of knowledge within UK\nindustry of the wider issue of Supply Chain Vulnerability, and where possible to\nidentify \u2018best practice\u2019 tools and approaches. A literature review provided a\nsummary of current thinking in terms of risk management from the perspectives of\nthe academic supply chain management community. This provided a working\ndefinition of supply chain vulnerability as \u201can exposure to serious disturbance,\narising from risks within the supply chain as well as risks external to the supply\nchain\u201d. The distinction between risks internal and external to the supply chain is in\npractice an artificial one, though it offers a welcome point of reference in reviewing\nand positioning other bodies of work.\nThe study itself found that in the UK public sector, Emergency Planning and\nManagement is a well-established discipline, the principles of which were laid down\nwithin local government during the Second World War. The Emergency Planning\nCollege, Easingwold, Yorkshire (www.epcollege.gov.uk) has an extensive holding of\nliterature on the subject. Searches undertaken for this project confirmed that\nalthough issues of terrorist attacks on infrastructure were dealt with at length,\nspecific references to disruptions to supply chains were conspicuously absent.\n7In the commercial sector (the primary focus of the report), companies had been\naware of the need for crisis management and disaster recovery planning for some\nconsiderable time, though this was and remains primarily a single firm\npreoccupation. Concerns over the possible impact of Y2K had done much to push\nthe notion of inter-organisational dependency and a need for a more cohesive\nindustry-wide approach to \u2018Business Continuity\u2019 to the fore, albeit along a single\ndimension, that of IT.\nThe research concluded that the issue of supply chain vulnerability (and by\nimplication that of supply chain resilience) lacked the necessary research base to\ncomprehend a subject of this breath and importance. Furthermore, many\norganisations currently lacked an awareness of the need to consider the resilience of\ntheir supply chains as part of their overall approach to risk and business continuity\nmanagement. Beyond that, the research concluded that a number of tools should\nbe provided to assist organisations, large and small, in the identification and\nmanagement of supply chain risks [10]. These conclusions have shaped the terms\nof reference for the subsequent programme of research into \u2018Supply Chain\nResilience\u2019 that is the subject of this paper.\nIn the months between the commissioning of the first study, its publication and the\nsubsequent research programme, public sector Emergency Planning received\nrenewed impetus in the UK and elsewhere around the world. For example, the UK\nCivil Contingencies Secretariat was established in July 2001, under the auspices of\nThe Cabinet Office, to coordinate the different strands of government activity that\nquickly come into play as a crisis unfolds (www.ukresilience.info\/role.htm).\nIn North America, the events of September 11th 2001 have since unleashed a flood\nof articles on supply chain risk and vulnerability. In the parlance of the first\nCranfield report, the emphasis of this body of work is on the identification and\nmanagement of risk external to the supply chain. In particular these articles\ndiscuss the need for and the implications of anti-terrorism measures implemented\nby the US authorities, and their impact on domestic business and international trade\n8[11]. The US-based industry association, the Council of Logistics Management has\npublished a weighty report, entitled \u2018Securing the Supply Chain\u2019. This too focuses\non aspects of civil emergency and disaster management [12].\nIn academia as a whole, interest is growing in the study of risks internal to the\nsupply chain. Recent work in the UK, continental Europe and from the USA picks up\nvarious themes, much of them reflecting purchasing and supplier management\nconcerns, including those associated with new product development. The emphasis\nof recent additions to this body of work is largely, though not exclusively, on the\nmanagement of commercial risk principally in manufacturing industries [13]. Other\nresearch projects are now underway, though empirically based published work\nremains sparse.\nDuring the course of this research programme it became increasingly evident that\nmodern supply chains are probably at greater risk than many of those who manage\nthem recognise. Whilst the existence of the many disturbances to the business\nenvironment (e.g. wars, epidemics, earthquakes) are readily acknowledged as\nsources of risk, it is less clear that the risks from within the supply\/demand network\nare always apparent.\nOne of the fundamental issues is the lack of understanding of the wider supply\ndemand network amongst managers. Supply chains still tend to be thought of as\nprimarily \u2018linear\u2019 structures. That is, product flows from one organisation to another\nand eventually to an end-user. The reality is that the supply\/demand network is\nmore like a tree with a multitude of branches and a complex root system, with the\ntrunk of the tree representing the processes of the focal firm.\nIt is essential that individual business entities and those who manage them\nunderstand the extent of the network of which they are a part and systematically\nexplore the network to identify its vulnerabilities.\n9Categorising Risk\nSupply chain risks can be categorised in many different ways and from different\nperspectives, e.g. from a corporate governance or financial risk agenda, or even in\nterms of a multi-level complex system [14]. However, based upon a framework\noriginally proposed by Mason-Jones & Towill [15], we suggest that at its simplest\nthere are three categories of risk which can be further sub-divided to produce a\ntotal of five categories:-\n\uf0a7 Internal to the firm\no Process\no Control\n\uf0a7 External to the firm but internal to the supply chain network\no Demand\no Supply\n\uf0a7 External to the network\no Environmental\n10\nFigure 1 summarises the linkages between these risk categories:-\nFigure 1 : Sources of Risk in the Supply Chain\nEach of these five categories are briefly described below:-\nProcesses are the sequences of value-adding and managerial activities undertaken\nby the firm. The execution of these processes is likely to be immediately dependent\non internally owned or managed assets and on a functioning infrastructure.\nTherefore, internally owned or managed assets and the reliability of supporting\ntransport, communication and infrastructure should be carefully considered.\nProcess risk relates to disruptions to these processes.\nControls are the assumptions, rules, systems and procedures that govern how an\norganisation exerts control over the processes. In terms of the supply chain they\nmay be order quantities, batch sizes, safety stock policies etc. plus the policies and\nprocedures that govern asset and transportation management. Control risk is\ntherefore the risks arising from the application or misapplication of these rules.\nSUPPLY\nRISK\nPROCESS\nRISK\nDEMAND\nRISK\nCONTROL\nRISK\nEnvironmental Risk\n11\nThe next two categories are external to the focal firm, but remain internal to the\ninter- organisational networks through which materials, products and information\nflow. Ideally the focal firm should have an awareness of potential or actual\ndisturbances to the anticipated flow of product and information from within and\nbetween every node or link in the supply chain networks through which its own\nvalue-streams flow. In practical terms this may not be possible, but the focal firm\nshould at least strive to familiarise itself with those risks that are known or likely to\naffect adjacent organisations. It is unlikely that the focal firm will ever have\nintimate knowledge of all potential risks, though appropriate monitoring should\nincrease the likelihood and provide early warning of actual events.\nDemand risk relates to potential or actual disturbances to the flow of product,\ninformation, and in this instance cash emanating from within the network, between\nthe focal firm and the market. In particular, it relates to the processes, controls,\nasset and infrastructure dependencies of the organisations downstream and\nadjacent to the focal firm.\nSupply risk is the upstream equivalent of the above, it relates to potential or actual\ndisturbances to the flow of product or information emanating from within the\nnetwork, upstream of the focal firm.\nThe fifth and final category relates to disruptions that are external to the network of\norganisations through which the value-streams\/product supply chains flow.\nEnvironment - These events may of course directly impact upon the focal firm or\non those upstream or downstream, or indeed on the marketplace itself. They may\naffect a particular value stream (e.g. product contamination) or any node or link\nthrough which the supply chain passes (e.g. as the result of an accident, direct\naction, extreme weather or natural disasters). They may be the result of socio-\npolitical, economic or technological events many miles or organisations removed\nfrom the focal firm\u2019s own supply chains, but may have carry-over effects through\n12\nlinkages to other industry networks. The type or timing of these events may be\npredictable (e.g. those arising from regulatory changes), but many will not be,\nthough the impact of these types of events may still be assessed. However our\nresearch revealed instances where organisations had every opportunity to identify\nforthcoming disruptions, but either failed to do so. The industrial action affecting\nthe US West Coast ports in 2002 was one such example. Well ahead of the actual\nevents the likelihood of disruptions was discussed in the press and on television\nnews channels. The same channels later reported the massive disruptions to supply\nchains experienced by those who did not head the warnings.\nA further issue which adds to supply chain risk is that upstream and downstream\n\u2018visibility\u2019 is often very poor. In other words there is frequently only a limited\nexchange of information between adjacent entities in a network. For example a\nsupplier to an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) may have no information on\nthe rate of sale that the manufacturer is achieving, only receiving sporadic orders\nwith the expectation that delivery can be made within an ever-shorter timescale.\nThe reality is that most organisations are \u2018forecast-driven\u2019 rather than \u2018demand-\ndriven\u2019 and are forced to take decisions in isolation of each other. Whilst this lack of\nshared information is a source of considerable additional cost to the supply chain as\na whole, it is also a significant source of vulnerability.\nThere is often a significant \u2018disconnect\u2019 in organisations between the determination\nof business strategy and the recognition of the impact of those strategic decisions\nupon supply chain vulnerability. For example many companies have moved from\ndomestic to global sourcing in search of lower unit costs. However, that definition of\ncost is too limited \u2013 it does not always take account of the increased risk to the\nsupply chain through extended\/lead-times, reliance on partners who themselves\nmay be vulnerable to external events or the potential loss of control.\nThe need for formalised procedures for supply chain risk management within and\nbetween organisations emerges very strongly from this research. The findings of\nthe empirical study revealed that practitioners frequently struggle to come to terms\n13\nwith the scope and variety of potential risks. Consequently, many were unable to\nreadily identify appropriate tools and techniques which might be employed to\nmanage the panoply of potential risks. Furthermore whilst some form of business\ncontinuity planning exists within most large businesses, business continuity\nmanagement has been slow to take into account the risks that emanate from the\nwider supply\/demand network. It is our contention that many of the threats to\nbusiness continuity lie outside the focal firm, hence the need for a much broader\nperspective when it comes to contingency or continuity planning.\nBased upon these conclusions what actions should be taken?\nThe Way Ahead: Creating the Resilient Supply Chain\nEmerging from our research programme are a number of discernible general\nprinciples that underpin resilience in supply chains. Most echo rather than\ncontradict the widely accepted principles of good supply chain management.\nFirstly, it seems that resilience should be designed in. In other words there are\ncertain features that, if engineered into a supply chain, can improve its resilience.\nThe second general principle is that because by definition supply chains will\nnormally extend across different corporate entities there will need to be a high level\nof collaborative working if risk is to be identified and managed.\nThirdly resilience implies agility. Being able to react quickly to unpredictable events\nis clearly a distinct advantage in an uncertain environment.\nFinally resilience in the supply chain will be enhanced, and indeed made possible, by\nthe creation of a risk management culture in the organisation. The message that\nneeds to be understood and acted upon is that the biggest risk to business\ncontinuity may well come from the wider supply chain rather than from within the\n14\nbusiness. The remainder of this paper briefly examines these four key principles, as\nsummarised in Figure 2.\nTake in Figure 2\n1. Supply Chain (re) Engineering\nConventionally supply chains have often been designed to optimise for cost and\/or\ncustomer service, rarely was resilience the \u2018objective function\u2019 for the optimisation\nprocess. Given the risks to which modern supply chains are exposed this may need\nto change. A number of recommendations are suggested to provide the basis for\nthe design of supply chains with risk reduction in mind.\ni. Supply chain understanding\nA fundamental pre-requisite for improved supply chain resilience is an\nunderstanding of the network that connects the business to its suppliers and their\nsuppliers and to its downstream customers. Mapping tools can help in the\nidentification of \u2018pinch points\u2019 and \u2018critical paths\u2019.\nPinch points will often be characterised as bottlenecks where there is a limit of\ncapacity and where alternative options may not be available e.g. ports capable of\ntaking large container vessels or central distribution facilities which if they were to\nbecome inoperable would place a heavy strain on the rest of the system.\nA critical path in the supply chain\/network may have one or more of the following\ncharacteristics:\n\uf0b7 Long lead-times e.g. the time taken to replenish components from\norder to delivery.\n\uf0b7 A single source of supply with no short-term alternative.\n15\n\uf0b7 Linkages where \u2018visibility\u2019 is poor, i.e. little or no shared information\nbetween nodes.\n\uf0b7 High levels of identifiable risk (i.e. supply, demand, process, control\nand environmental risk).\nThe results of this risk assessment exercise should also be used to create a supply\nchain risk register where the vulnerabilities of critical nodes and links in the network\nare noted and procedures for their monitoring and subsequent mitigation and\nmanagement defined.\nii. Supply base strategy\nWhilst there has been a move towards the reduction of the supplier base in many\ncompanies, there may be limits to which the process should be pursued. Single\nsourcing, where one supplier is responsible for the supply of a specific item or\nservice may be advantageous from a cost and quality management perspective, but\nis dangerous in terms of resilience. Whilst it may be desirable to have a lead\nsupplier, wherever possible alternative sources should be available. Where a firm\nhas multiple sites it may be possible to have a single source for an item or service\ninto each site thus gaining some of the advantages of single sourcing without the\ndownside risk. Similarly if a manufacturing firm makes a range of products it may\nbe possible to single source by product thus keeping an alternative source of supply\navailable.\nIt is strongly advocated that one of the key criteria for the selection of suppliers\nshould be the risk awareness of the supplier. For example have they audited their\nown supply chain risk profile? Do they have procedures in place for the monitoring\nand mitigation of risk? It may be appropriate for the company to adopt a pro-active\nstrategy of supplier development to work closely with key suppliers to help them\nimprove their supply chain risk management practices.\n16\niii. Design principles for supply chain resilience\nA number of principles have emerged from our research, which should be\nconsidered when (re) engineering supply chains to improve resilience:\n\uf0b7 Choose supply chain strategies that keep several options open. This may not\nbe the lowest cost course of action in the short term but may provide an\nopportunity to reduce the impact of a disruption if and when it occurs. There\nis an analogy here with \u2018Real Options Theory\u2019 in investment planning. Thus a\nstrategy that is based around centralisation of distribution facilities may be\nthe lowest cost option but it could also shut down other options and hence\nincrease vulnerabilities.\n\uf0b7 Re-examine the \u2018efficiency vs. redundancy\u2019 trade off. Conventionally surplus\ncapacity and inventory have been seen only as \u2018waste\u2019 and are therefore\nundesirable. However, the strategic disposition of additional capacity and\/or\ninventory at potential \u2018pinch points\u2019 can be extremely beneficial in the\ncreation of resilience within the supply chain. The trade-offs inevitably\ninvolve the judgemental balancing of the cost handicap involved in\nmaintaining slack \u2018just-in-case\u2019, against the probability and likely impact of a\nnegative event. Not a message that hard pressed corporate executives are\nnecessarily willing to hear. Nevertheless, if resilience is to be taken seriously,\nsurplus capacity may well be the lesser evil, being more flexible than\ninventory, which may already be committed to its final form or destination.\nBoth capacity and inventory can provide \u2018slack\u2019 in a supply chain to enable\nsurge effects to be coped with. Inventory, carried in a generic or semi-\nconfigured form, can enable the creation of a \u2018de-coupling point\u2019 which,\ntogether with additional capacity (e.g. production, transport, people), can\nenable demand uncertainty to be more effectively managed. Whilst not\nadvocating a return to the days of buffering every stage in the supply chain\nwith safety stock or excess capacity, we do suggest that the strategic and\nselective use of \u2018slack\u2019 may be fundamental to supply chain resilience.\n17\n2. Supply Chain Collaboration\nIt will be apparent that since supply chain vulnerability is by definition a network-\nwide concept, the management of risk has to be network-wide too. A high level of\ncollaborative working across supply chains can significantly help mitigate risk. The\nchallenge is to create the conditions in which collaborative working becomes\npossible. Traditionally supply chains have been characterized by arms-length, even\nadversarial, relationships between the different players. There has not been a\nhistory of sharing information either with suppliers or customers. More recently\nhowever there have been encouraging signs that a greater willingness to work in\npartnership is emerging in many supply chains. In the fast moving consumer goods\n(fmcg) industry there is now significant collaboration between manufacturers and\nretailers in the form of Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment\n(CPFR) initiatives [16].\nThe underlying principle of collaborative working in the supply chain is that the\nexchange of information can reduce uncertainty. Thus a key priority for supply\nchain risk reduction has to be the creation of a supply chain community to enable\nthe exchange of information between members of that community. The aim is to\ncreate a high level of \u2018supply chain intelligence\u2019 whereby there is a greater visibility\nof upstream and downstream risk profiles (and changes in those profiles).\nSupply chain intelligence is the phrase we have coined to describe the process of\nusing knowledge generated and shared by partners in the supply chain. The type of\nknowledge that can aid the creation of supply chain resilience pertains to the\nidentification of sources of risk and uncertainty at each node and link in the supply\nchain. Supply chain knowledge might also be categorized as Strategic, Tactical and\nOperational (see Figure 3).\nStrategic knowledge is an awareness of trends and emerging issues that may have\nan impact on supply chain continuity at some point in the future. This type of\n18\nknowledge can be generated through formal \u2018P.E.S.T.\u2019 type analysis (Political,\nEconomic, Social and Technological). Such analyses are intended to enable a\nformalized appraisal of the context within which networks and supply chains\noperate.\nAt the tactical level the knowledge required is specific to the assessment of risk to\ncurrent operations; primarily demand, supply, process and control risk.\nThe third level of knowledge is operational and pertains to the day-to-day\nmanagement of the business. The emerging field of Supply Chain Event\nManagement (SCEM) is potentially of great value in this regard [17].\nFigure 3 : Supply Chain Knowledge\n3. Agility\nSupply chain agility can be defined as the ability to respond rapidly to unpredictable\nchanges in demand or supply. Many organisations are at risk because their\nresponse times to demand changes or supply disruption are too long. Agility has\nmany dimensions and it relates as much to networks as it does to individual\ncompanies. Indeed, a key to agile response is the presence of agile partners\nupstream and downstream of the focal firm.\nP.E.S.T.\nSupply Chain\nRisk Assessment\nEvent Management\nStrategic\nTactical\nOperational\n19\nTwo key ingredients of agility are \u2018visibility\u2019 and \u2018velocity\u2019.\ni. Supply Chain Visibility\nPut very simply, supply chain visibility is the ability to see from one end of the\npipeline to the other. Visibility implies a clear view of upstream and downstream\ninventories, demand and supply conditions, and production and purchasing\nschedules for example. It also implies internal visibility with clear lines of\ncommunications and agreement on \u2018one set of numbers\u2019.\nVisibility in a supply chain can be obscured by the presence of intervening\ninventories upstream and downstream of the focal firm. These intervening\ninventories are usually created independently of each other as a result of decision\nrules, the basis of which may not be readily apparent. Visibility will be further\ndistorted by the presence of the bullwhip effect [18] that can magnify small changes\nin marketplace demand as it moves back up the supply chain.\nThe achievement of supply chain visibility is based upon close collaboration with\ncustomers and suppliers as well as internal integration within the business.\nCollaborative planning with customers is important firstly to enable visibility of\ndemand to be gained but also for information to be shared on market trends and\nperceptions of risk. Equally, upstream visibility also requires high levels of\ncollaborative planning with suppliers and the use of \u2018event management\u2019 logic to\nenable alerts of potential supply disruptions to be signalled.\nA significant barrier to supply chain visibility is often encountered within the focal\nfirm\u2019s internal organization structure. The presence of \u2018functional silos\u2019 inhibits the\nfree flow of information leading to \u2018second guessing\u2019 and a general lack of\ncommunication. This situation is often exacerbated when the company has internal\nsuppliers or customers with limited integration between them. The challenge here\nis to break down these silos to create multi-disciplinary, cross-functional process\nteams.\n20\nii. Supply Chain Velocity\nThe second ingredient of supply chain agility is velocity. Velocity is defined as\ndistance over time. Hence to increase velocity, time must be reduced. Here we are\nreferring to \u2018end-to-end\u2019 pipeline time i.e. the total time it takes to move product\nand materials from one end of the supply chain to the other. End-to-end pipeline\ntime \u2013 as it relates to agility \u2013 can be measured as the elapsed time from when the\nfocal firm places orders on its first tier suppliers to when it delivers to its customers.\nIt is not just velocity that matters in the creation of agile supply chains, it is\nacceleration. In other words how rapidly can the supply chain react to changes in\ndemand, upwards or downwards?\nThere are three basic foundations for improved supply chain velocity and\nacceleration: streamlined processes, reduced in-bound lead-times and non-value\nadded time reduction.\nStreamlined processes are simplified processes in that they have been engineered\nto reduce the number of stages or activities involved, they are designed to perform\nthese activities in parallel rather than in series and they are e-based rather than\npaper-based. At the same time these streamlined processes are designed around\nminimal batch sizes \u2013 be they order quantities, production batch sizes or shipping\nquantities. The emphasis is on flexibility rather than economies of scale.\nThe second key ingredient to enhanced velocity in supply chains is a reduction in in-\nbound lead-times. One of the criteria for the choice of supplier and the source of\nsupply should be their ability to respond rapidly in terms of delivery and to be able\nto cope with short-term changes in volume and mix requirements.\nSynchronisation of schedules based on shared information enables suppliers to\nbecome more agile without necessarily having to rely on inventory as a buffer with\nall its consequential problems.\n21\nThe third building-block in achieving velocity improvements comes from reducing\nthe non-value adding time in the pipeline. Most time spent in a supply chain is not\nvalue-adding from a customer perspective. More often than not it is idle time i.e.\ninventory. That inventory is itself generated as a result of cumbersome processes \u2013\nevery day of process time requires at least a day of inventory to cover during that\nlead-time.\n4. Creating a Supply Chain Risk Management Culture\nIn the same way that many organizations recognized that the only way to make\nTotal Quality Management (TQM) a reality was to engender a culture that made\nquality the concern of everyone, so too today is there a requirement to create a risk\nmanagement culture within the business. We would argue that this culture of risk\nmanagement should extend beyond the boundaries of corporate risk and business\ncontinuity management to become \u2018supply chain continuity management\u2019.\nAs in every case of culture change at an organizational level, nothing is possible\nwithout leadership from the top of the organization. One of the key conclusions of\nour research is that supply chain risks present the most serious threat to business\ncontinuity and yet as our research revealed, paradoxically, not every company has\nsupply chain management represented in its own right in the Boardroom. If the\nsupply chain has a voice at all at that level it is often represented through IS\/IT\nDirectors or Vice-Presidents. Whilst this can work it is often the case that in such\ninstances the understanding of what constitutes supply chain risk is limited to an\ninformation systems based perspective.\nIt can also be argued that supply chain risk assessment should be a formal part of\nthe decision making process at every level. Thus for example when new products\nare at the design stage, issues of supply chain vulnerability such as component\navailability and lead times should be considered. Similarly when changes in\nbusiness strategy are contemplated such as a move to off-shore sourcing from\ndomestic sourcing, then the resulting supply chain risk profile should be assessed.\n22\nA supply chain risk management team should be created within the business and\ncharged with regularly updating the supply chain risk register and to report to the\nmain Board through the supply chain director on a least a quarterly basis. The\nteam will need to be cross-functional and to be able to audit risk using the\nframeworks and tools we have put forward in this report.\nConclusion\nOur research has highlighted the risks to business continuity that lie in the wider\nsupply chain. The trends towards the creation of increasingly complex networks of\ninter-dependent organisations \u2013 through strategies of out-sourcing and globalisation\nin particular \u2013 have heightened some of these risks.\nIt has become apparent that many organisations have not fully recognised the\nnature of systemic supply chain risk and have continued to focus on seeking\nefficiency improvements through \u2018lean\u2019 solutions. We have argued that a new\npriority has emerged for business planning. This priority has to be the search for\nsupply chain strategies that embody a significantly higher degree of resilience.\nResilience implies flexibility and agility. Its implications extend beyond process re-\ndesign to fundamental decisions on sourcing and the establishment of more\ncollaborative supply chain relationships based on far greater transparency of\ninformation.\nThese are major challenges to business leaders in every industry which urgently\nrequire attention.\nLimitations and Further Research\nThis paper draws on the empirical evidence contained in earlier UK government\nfunded research into supply chain vulnerability, together with that presented in\nother recently published studies. From the evidence contained in this limited but\n23\nexpanding pool of work the need for a structured approach to the management of\nsupply chain risk was identified. The paper sets out a framework for improved\nsupply chain risk identification based on a process control perspective, assisting the\nmanager in identifying sources of risk, in terms of their location relative to the focal\nfirm. The authors recognise that other approaches to the segmentation and\nidentification of supply chain risk are presented within the literature cited, but not\nfrom a normative managerial perspective as is the intention here. The exploration\nof these other approaches is beyond the scope of this paper. The route-map\nframework for supply chain resilience is put forward in the same spirit, drawing as\nappropriate on widely accepted principles of demand-driven supply chain\nmanagement together with useful perspectives borrowed from risk management in\nother spheres, including finance.\nThe likelihood that costs will be incurred in maintaining supply chain redundancy\n\u2018just-in-case\u2019 is acknowledged. However, an analysis of the short and long-term\ncosts associated with measures, such as the application of real options thinking,\nmust be left for other authors to pursue in greater detail. Similarly, the exact trade\noffs between the different risks associated with make or buy decisions, or the\nquality and other cost-related benefits of single sourcing, when set against the\npotential losses should that source of supply fail, fall beyond the scope of this work.\nIt is left to others to tackle these essential bottom line questions. The authors\naccept that, ultimately, these questions will have to be answered if the commercial\ncommunity is voluntarily to sacrifice short term cost optimisation in favour of\nimproved and sustainable supply chain-wide resilience.\n24\nFigure 2\nCREATING THE RESILIENT SUPPLY CHAIN\nResilient\nSupply\nChains\nSupply Chain\nCollaboration\nAgility\nCreate a Supply\nChain risk management\nculture\nSupply Chain\n(re) engineering1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\nEstablish supply\nchain continuity\nteams\nBoard-level\nresponsibility\n& leadership\nFactor risk\nconsiderations\ninto decision\nmaking\nVisibility\nVelocity\n&\nAcceleration\nCollaborative\nplanning\nSupply Chain\nintelligence\nSupply base\nstrategy\nSourcing\ndecisions &\ncriteria\nSupplier\ndevelopment\nSupply Chain\nunderstanding\nMapping &\ncritical path\nanalysis\nSupply\nchain\nrisk register\nSupply chain\ndesign principles\nReal options\nthinking\nEfficiency\nvs\nredundancy\n25\nReferences\n[1] Christopher, Martin & Denis Towill, \u201cDeveloping Market Specific Supply Chain\nStrategies\u201d, International Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 13, No. 1,\n(2002), pp 1-13\n[2] Peck, Helen & Uta J\u00fcttner, \u201cRisk Management in the Supply Chain\u201d, Focus,\nDecember, (2002), pp 17-22\n[3] Hakansson, H. and I.
