Following  calls  by  authors  such  as\nColeman & Crang (2002), Crang (1997, 2002, 2003),  Crouch  (2000a\/b),  Edensor,  (1998,  2000,\n2001),  Franklin  &  Crang  (2001)  and  Rose  &   Gregson   (2000)   to   address   the   embodied,\nperformative nature of social practice, methods adopted in  research  are  experiencing  significant\nchange. Such shift is paralleled in tourism research as  tourism  and  the  tourist  experience  is  no\nlonger identified as a series of linear, static and dislocated spaces made knowable through a  series\nof predetermined actions and behaviours (Franklin & Crang, 2001). Rather, it emerges as a  fusion\nof fluid and dynamic mobilities and  materialities,  embodied  and  affectual  encounters.  Tourism\nbecomes a series  of  rhythms,  flows  and  fluxes,  in-between  points  and  stages  through  which\ntourists move in and around place as both imagined and  experientially  encountered.  As  research\nmoves to occupy such spaces of the tourist experience and as authors such as Tribe (2004) call for\ngreater intellectual space for \u2018new\u2019 research, we must be methodologically equipped to embark on\nsuch a journey. New and alternative methods are required that engage with research participants in\nways that move beyond the realms  of  representation  to  access  the  haptic,  non-representational\nspaces of encounter and experience.\nThis   paper   seeks   to   develop   existing   visual   methods   in   tourism   and   proposes   visual\nautoethnography  as  one  potential  route  to  accessing  the  embodied,   sensual   and   emotional\nexperiences of tourists\u2019 encounters with place.  As Pink (2007) suggests:\n\u201c\u2018visual research methods\u2019 are not purely visual. Rather, they pay particular  attention  to\nvisual aspects of culture. Similarly, they cannot be used independently  of  other  methods;\nneither a purely visual ethnography  nor  an  exclusively  visual  approach  to  culture  can\nexist\u201d (p. 21).\nWhere words fail, I suggest visual autoethnography opens spaces  of  understanding;  transcending\nthe limitations of verbal discourse and opening spaces for  creativity  and  appreciation,  reflection\nand  comprehension  as  researcher  and  respondent  explore  the  intricate  performances  through\nwhich  knowledge  and  encounters  of  self  and  other  are  enlivened.  Using  a   combination   of\nautoethnography and photo-elicitation within the interview setting, visual autoethnography ignites\nan   embodied   connection   and   understanding   between   researcher   and    respondent.    Thus,\nconversations materialise  through  intersubjective  negotiation  as  visuals  mobilise  an  enriched,\nembodied research  space  within  which  previously  \u2018hidden\u2019  understandings  of  tourist  practice\nemerge. Mobilising a \u201csharing of speech\u201d and \u201csounds of silence\u201d, the image becomes  the  bridge\nthat  connects  researcher\u2019s  autoethnographic  experiences  with  those  of  respondent\u2019s   as   they\nemerge within the space of the interview.\nBEYOND PHOTO-ELICITATION & TOWARDS VISUAL AUTOETHNOGRAPHY\n*Please insert Figure 1 about here\nLooking at Figure 1, Donna shared her anticipations of Peru:\nDonna:              \u201c\u2026perhaps is like going to  the  souks\u2026in  Tunisia,  but  I  just  hope  you\nwouldn\u2019t be pestered as much as you  are,  yeah  yeah,  that  is  something  I\ndon\u2019t want is to be pestered, I don\u2019t like bartering\u2026\nInterviewer:    \u2026you almost like imagine the sounds and\u2026.\nDonna:              \u2026yeah, I imagine it is going to be bustling, noisy, I can  imagine  the  city,\nLima might just be like any other city, but once we get to Cusco, and  going\nup to Machu Picchu I can imagine that it will be fairly Spanish as  well,  but\nmore agricultural maybe\u2026\u201d\nAs Pink (2007) realises, using  visual  methods  to  access  sensory  experiences  is  not  entirely  a\nmodern-day phenomenon, but finds its origins in  the  \u201csensorially-rich\u201d  experiences  captured  in\nthe \u201chaptic film making\u201d practices of Alfred Cort Haddon in 1898. Yet, it was only in  the  1990\u2019s\nthat researchers (see  Classen,  1993)  began  to  address  the  role  of  the  senses  in  ethnography.\nIndeed, the methods upon which we  in  tourism  have  long  relied,  and  even  disciplines  widely\nexperienced in visual methods, have \u201cgiven only cursory acknowledgement to the other  senses  in\ntheir arguments for a visual ethnographic methodology\u201d (Pink, 2007, p. 42). Such transition shifts\nunderstanding of vision and the visual away from  paradigms  of  ocularcentrism  (Jay,  1997)  and\nreconceptualises the visual as integral to other sensory modalities as we use not only our eyes,  but\nalso our minds, bodies,  genders,  personalities  and  histories  (see  Taussig,  1993,  cit.  Edwards,\nGosden & Phillips, 2006; Walker &  Chaplin,  1997).  Such  calls  are  echoed  within  tourism  as\nresearch embraces the plurality of sensual interplays of tourist  practice  (see  for  example  Crang,\n1999; Franklin & Crang, 2001; Veijola & Jokinen, 1994). Indeed, as the vignette above  indicates,\ntourism  exists  as  a  series  of  entirely  embodied  practices   as   tourists   encounter   the   world\nmultidimensionally and multisensually (Crouch &  Lubbren,  2003;  Scarles,  2009).  Yet,  despite\nsuch conceptual shifts, the visual methods employed within  tourism  research  are  yet  to  parallel\nsuch change.\nIndeed, over the last two decades, visual methods in tourism research have been relatively ad-hoc.\nAs Burns & Lester (2005) suggest: \u201cAs a consequence, a potentially  rich  seam  of  evidence  that\ncan inform our understanding of tourism as a social  construct  and  set  of  phenomena  has  been\nunder-utilised, not to say undermined\u201d (: 50). Since early work on visuals in tourism by Albers  &\nJames (1983) and Cohen (1993), attention to the visual as method in tourism has largely remained\nconfined to the well-rehearsed methods of content analysis (see for example  Dann,  1988;  Dilley,\n1986;  Edwards,  1996;  Pritchard,  2001;  Thurot  &  Thurot,  1983)  and  semiotic  analysis   (see\namongst others Markwell,  2001)  of  tourist  media.  Indeed,  despite  increasing  attention  to  the\nopportunities afforded by visuals such as film (see  Bolan  2009;  Burns  &  Lester,  2005),  online\nvisual blogging (Dwivedi & Yadav, 2009) and  visitor  books  (see  Noy,  2008),  the  potential  of\nvisuals as research methods in tourism has yet to be realised.\nIndeed, while the use of photographs as a technique of elicitation in interviews by Collier in 1967,\nearly examples of such techniques in tourism research remained  absent  until  work  from  authors\nsuch  as  Botterill  &  Compton  (1987)  and  Botterill  (1988,  1989)   where   photo-elicitation   is\nemployed to understand  tourist  experiences  via  tourists  own  photographs.  Cederholm  (2004),\nJenkins (1999) and MacKay & Couldwell (2004) amongst  others  have  also  drawn  upon  photo-\nelicitation. Such techniques of  elicitation  can  be  researcher-led  as  prescribed  photographs  are\nbrought to the interview setting or alternatively respondent-led as respondents  produce  their  own\nphotographs (at times in accordance with instructions  set  out  by  the  researcher),  or  bring  pre-\nexisting images of particular environments, practices or experiences.  Some,  like  Garrod  (2007),\nrefer  to  such  practice  as  volunteer-employed  photography  where  respondents  do  not  simply\nintroduce their own photographs to the research setting, but actually produce primary data as  they\nare given the task of taking photographs primarily for the purpose of the research.\nSince the emergence  of  photo-elicitation,  the  advantages  of  introducing  photographs  into  the\ninterview  setting  have  been  well-established.  Visuals  facilitate  rapport,  provide  security  and\ncomfort as respondents reach  out,  touch  or  hold  the  photographs  around  which  conversations\ndevelop. They trigger  and  sharpen  respondents\u2019  memories  and  recollections  (Cronin  &  Gale,\n1996), facilitate the articulation of ideas and build bridges between the conscious and unconscious\nas  knowledges  are  retrieved  (Harper,  2002).  However,   turning   attention   to   respondent-led\nelicitation, it is not only the  benefits  outlined  above  that  are  realised  as  space  also  arises  for\nselectivity as respondents are able to \u201creflect on their  experience  of  taking  the  photograph  and\ntheir decision making regarding what to include in the show (and by  implication  what  to  omit)\u201d\n(Garrod, 2007). As Radley & Taylor (2003) suggest, the introduction of respondents\u2019 photographs\noffers a \u201cmore powerful  tool  for  eliciting  (respondents)  experiences  than  would  an  interview\nalone\u201d (p. 79) (see also Harper, 2002, Pink, 2001).\nTalking through photographs increases respondent reflexivity as they  are  able  to  verbalise  their\nexperiences and  knowledges  as  pictured  by  them,  thus  eliciting  longer,  more  comprehensive\nresponses (see also Kamler  &  Threadgold,  2003;  Pink,  2001).   Warren  (2005)  refers  to  such\npractice as giving respondents \u201cphoto-voice\u201d, as photography provides  spaces  for  self-reflection\nand   subjective   positioning   of   respondents\u2019   practice.   Thus,   respondents   are   increasingly\nempowered as ownership shifts  away  from  the  researcher  and  the  research  agenda  is  viewed\nthrough a variety of \u2018lenses\u2019. Producing and\/or talking around their own  visuals  affords  nuanced\ninsights into practices, behaviours, cultures, social and political  relations  as  respondents  express\nreality as it is significant to them. Thus, elicitation moves towards  unpacking  the  \u201ccomplexity  of\nthe  entanglement  of  photographic  objects  in  human  social  relations\u201d   as   \u201cnowadays   using\nphotographs in interviews is considered not solely a means of data collection\u2026but as a  means  of\nproducing data through negotiation and reflexivity\u201d (Orobitg-Canal, 2004, p. 38).\nWhile such practice provides clear  avenues  for  accessing  and  articulating  insights  into  tourist\nbehaviour, visual autoethnography exists as a  fusion  of  visual  elicitation  and  autoethnographic\nencounter;  an  opportunity  for  accessing  and  mobilising   deeper,   nuanced   insights   into   the\nembodied performances, practices  and  processes  of  the  tourist  experience  that  recent  tourism\nresearch addresses.  It is no longer enough to listen and respond to respondents\u2019 narratives as  they\nemerge via elicited visuals. Rather, such reflexivity extends to researchers as \u201csubjectivity  should\nbe   engaged   with   as   a   central   aspect   of   ethnographic   knowledge,    interpretation    and\nrepresentation\u201d (Pink, 2007, p. 23). Such thought is well-rehearsed, for example:  Adkins  (2002);\nCloke, Crang, Goodwin, Painter & Philo (2003); Coffey (2002); Crang (2003); Denzin &  Lincoln\n(2000), who call for situated researcher reflexivity within research.  As  Krieger  (1996)  suggests,\nthere is a need to resituate the \u2018I\u2019  in  research  in  order  to  generate  affiliation  and  insights  and\ndevelop a fuller sense of self so that our understanding of others will not become fractured.\nUnlike  traditional  perspectives  of   ethnography,   visual   autoethnography   does   not   demand\nextended,  detailed  immersion  to  facilitate  an  understanding  of  grounded   ways   of   life   and\nworldviews via observation. Observation is no longer the method per se; a  study  of  what  people\nsay they do and what they are then seen to  do  and  say  by  observing  and  recording  a  series  of\nselected,  concrete  events  (Angrosino  &  Mays  Perez,  2000).  Rather,  visual   autoethnography\nemerges as a fusion  of  observation  and  first-hand  experience  that  is  subsequently  shared  via\nphotographs (or indeed potentially through film)  with  respondents  as  researcher  subjectivity  is\nembraced within the research setting (see for example: Church, 1995: Morgan &  Pritchard,  2005;\nSparkes, 2000; Westwood, Morgan & Pritchard, 2006). This does  not  negate  the  importance  of\nrespondents and their vital  role  as  knowledgeable,  situated  agents  who  hold  a  wealth  of  rich\ninsights into how the world is seen and lived (Cloke et al., 2003).  Rather,  it  recognises  that  \u201cwe\nneed to link our statements about what we study with  statements  about  ourselves,  for  in  reality\nneither stands alone\u201d (Krieger, 1996, p.191-192).\nThus,  visual  autoethnography  does  not  seek  to  mimic  or  attempt  to   replicate   respondents\u2019\nexperiences, but embraces situated knowledges (Rose, 1997). Researchers become \u201cactive agents\u201d\n(Spry, 2001); themselves engaging in a series of  active  doings  as  they  experience  the  research\nenvironment first-hand. Space therefore emerges to reflect upon the interacting nature of bodies as\nthe researcher too becomes the subject  of  research  (Scarles  &  Sanderson,  2007),  thus  blurring\ndistinctions between personal and social,  self  and  other  (Ellis  &  Bochner,  1996;  Spry,  2001).\nHowever,   while   traditional   autoethnographic   practices   elevate   the   \u201cepistemological    and\nontological nexus upon which the research process turns\u201d (Spry,  2001:  711),  resultant  texts  and\nsubsequent knowledge sharing emerges primarily through researcher  reflexivity  as  expressed  in\ndiaries, videos or poems (see Ellis & Bochner, 1996; Noy,  2007a\/b;  Reed-Danahay,  1997;  Spry,\n2001). This paper however, suggests that it is in combining researcher and  respondent  ontologies\nthrough active exchange within space of the interview that the  poesis  of  visual  autoethnography\narises. Researcher autoethnographies are no longer confined to textual representations that in  turn\nare (re)read and (re)interpreted by others. Rather, autoethnographic experiences are  reconstructed\nand relived through conversation with respondents through the visuals presented within  the  space\nof the interview as both researcher and respondent reflect upon their experiences within the  same,\nor similar contexts.\nWhile interviews are invariably imbued with researcher intention and purpose that necessitates the\nvery  need  for  researcher\/respondent  exchange,  through  visual  autoethnography  conversations\nemerge  through  mutual  co-construction.  Interviews  are   inherently   imbued   with   reason   as\nresearchers identify a series of  thematic  priorities  to  be  addressed  and  guide  conversations  to\nensure such issues are addressed. However, such practice should not assume a  linear  transference\nof  power  and  control  with  researchers  as  \u2018information  grabbers\u2019.   Rather,   flexibility   within\ninterviews  becomes  vital  (Cloke  et  al,  2003;  Mason,  2002)   as   conversations   engage   both\nresearcher and respondents in a mutual process  of  non-linear  improvisation;  each  proffering  or\nwithholding remembrances  and  selectively  sharing  experiences  as  deemed  appropriate.  Thus,\ninterviews  become  fluid,  dynamic  and  mutually  responsive  performances  within   which   the\nunpredictable and the unexpected fuse with more apparent pathways of discussion.\nIn  merging  subjective  horizons,   visual   autoethnography   offers   pathways   to   realising   the\nsituatedness of self alongside others that encourages self- reflexivity and critical  agency  (Ellis  &\nBochner, 2000; Reed-Danahay, 1997; Spry,  2001).  It  moves  beyond  representation  and  realist\nagenda that decontextualises subjects and searches  for  singular  truths  (Ellis  &  Bochner,  1996;\nReed-Danahay, 1997) and realises opportunities for multiple selves that \u201ctransform  the  authorial\n\u201cI\u201d  to  an  existential  \u201cwe\u201d\u201d  (Spry,  2001:  711).  Thus,  autoethnography  mobilises  a   critical\nengagement; a will to knowledge (Foucault, 1977) that strives to access the  multiplicity  of  truths\nthat exist within a mesh of power relations. In embracing  the  multiplicities  of  self  and  other,  it\nstrives to move  beyond  discursive  productions,  productions  of  power  and  the  propagation  of\nknowledge that potentially limit expressions of self and other. It provides translations  rather  than\ndescriptions; insights into the  experiential  world  of  tourism  rather  than  representations  of  the\ntourist experience (Noy, 2007) that mobilise \u201cblendings of genres and voices\u201d (Brettell, 1997, cit.\nReed-Danahay,  1997).  Thus,  responding  to  Crang\u2019s  (2003)  call  for  a  move  from  work  that\n\u201cdivides positionality formulaically into being insiders (good but impossible)  and  outsiders  (bad\nbut  inevitable)\u201d  (p.496),  visual  autoethnography  does  not  claim  to  reposition   researcher   as\n\u2018tourist\u2019  or  \u2018insider\u2019,  but  rather  negotiates  researcher  subjectivity  towards  the  centre  of   the\nresearch process as \u2018researcher-as-tourist\u2019. Authenticities of \u2018insider\u2019  are  deconstructed  as  truths\narise  via  the  multiple  and  shifting  identities  that  characterise  our  lives  are  explored  (Reed-\nDanahay,  1997)  to  move  beyond  a  \u201csystematic  blindness;  a  refusal  to  see  and  understand\u201d\n(Foucault, 1977: 55).\nIn reversing  such  blindness  and  opening  the  possibilities  of  multiple  truths,  research  spaces\nexpose the lived nature of experiences. Through visual autoethnography, researchers are no longer\nremoved  or  distanced,  but  are  situated  within  research,  geographically,   socially,   culturally,\neconomically and politically.  We  live  and  breathe  the  research  environment,  engaging  in  the\nkinaesthetic nature of  research  (see  Crang,  2003,  Spinney,  2006,  Thrift  &  Dewsbury,  2000).\nThrough self-witnessing we commit our bodies to the  intimacies  of  experiential  encounters  and\nbecome witness to place for  ourselves.  Indeed,  such  is  the  implicit  role  of  our  bodies  in  our\nresearch (see also  Crang,  2003)  that  the  sharing  of  autoethnographic  encounters  as  personal,\nintimate moments of self (Noy, 2007), becomes integral to the togetherness that  emerges  through\nthe use of visuals. As research seeks to unpack the \u201cfelt,  touched  and  embodied  constitutions  of\nknowledge\u201d (ibid, p.  501),  togetherness  arises  by  sharing  perspectives  of  selves;  bridging  or\ntranscending social and  cultural  difference  as  researcher  and  respondent  are  brought  together\nthrough common terrain that produces mutually intelligible meanings (Reed-Danahay, 1997).\nHowever, such exchange is not  limited  only  to  positive  encounters.  As  Noy  (2007)  suggests,\nautoethnography also embraces potential  negative  experiences,  that  resonate  with  sadness  and\nalienation, mundane or \u201cdeviant\u201d behaviours (Noy, 2007). In reflecting  upon  experiences  of  self\nand other as they arise through conversation within the interview setting,  visual  autoethnography\nnot only acknowledges the \u201cconcrete and symbolic\u201d spaces of tourism, but confronts and  explores\nthe  complexities  of  experiences  memories,  denials  and  emotions  (Noy,  2007).  Therefore,  in\nembracing  the  potential  for  a  multiplicity  of  touristic   practices,   conversations   mobilise   or\nstimulate  exchanges  that  may  otherwise  remain  \u2018hidden\u2019  through  the  selectivity  of  reflexive\nperformance. \nIndeed,   visual   autoethnography   should   not   assume   agreement   between   subjectivities   as\ndisjuncture can also arise as moments of researcher and respondent commonality are pervaded  by\ndifference as both come to the interview space with potential disparities in worldviews  and  belief\nsystems. However, such differences should not be  feared,  as  the  potential  of  such  clashes  can\nindeed serve to further unpack (and indeed emphasise) the multiplicity  of  touristic  performances\nthat challenge discursive productions of the tourist gaze  and  imagination,  thus  further  enriching\nresearch and respondent  understanding  of  the  spectrum  of  encounters,  emotions  and  feelings\nthrough which tourist experiences arise. Indeed, while the inherent mimesis  of  the  visual  cannot\nbe denied, as Rose (2001) suggests, there exists a multiplicity of  ways  of  responding  to  visuals.\nVisuals  become  culturally  fashioned  extensions  of  the  senses  (Lury,  1998)  and  thus,  visual\nautoethnography  provides  a  pathway  to  unpacking  a  series  of  potentialities  and  possibilities\nthrough which the intricacies of the tourist experience can be shared as respondents use visuals  to\n\u201cfashion their feelings\u2026and make them visible\u201d (Radley & Taylor, 2003, p.80). Indeed,  it  is  the\nrole of visual autoethnography in accessing such embodied experiences (Westwood, 2007)  that  is\nof interest in this paper.\nWithin visual autoethnography, visuals therefore become  more  than  merely  prompts  or  \u2018safety\nnets\u2019, but offer gateways for merging reflexive subjectivities; the bridge that connects researcher\u2019s\nand respondent\u2019s experiences as they emerge within the space of  the  interview.  As  pathways  to\nand of multisensual encounter, they become tools for complementing, reinforcing and  challenging\nshared experiences and it is such  attention  to  reflexive  embodied  performance  that  holds  \u201cthe\npotential  for  articulating  emergent  subjectivities  which  encompass  reality,   imagination   and\nreason, difference and commonality\u201d (Edwards et al., 2006, p. 11). Importance  therefore  lies  not\nin the content of photographs in interviews  per  se,  but  in  the  reason  and  need  for  their  being\n(Crang, 2003; Rose, 2003a\/b, Ryan, 2003) in \u201cattempt to understand what has been  made  visible\nand why\u201d (Radley & Taylor, 2003, p. 79). Indeed, it  is  the  emergent  intersubjective  encounters\nthat transpire as a result of autoethnographic experiences that further deepen our understanding  of\nthe intricacies and nuances of the embodied  performances  of  tourism  that  have  to  date  eluded\ntourism research.\nVisual autoethnography therefore demands researchers move to embrace  traditionally  \u201cforbidden\nnarratives\u201d (Church, 1995) that deny silent  authorship  (see  for  example:  Charmaz  &  Mitchell,\n1997; Church, 1995; Holt,  2003)  as  research  is  expressed  in  the  first-person.  As  researchers\u2019\npersonal  narratives,  experiences  and  reflections  infuse  conversations,  the  use  of   first-person\nemphasises  resultant  intersubjectivities.  Ellis  &   Bochner   (2000)   refer   to   this   process   of\ncommitting our selves to research; expressing self through dialogue,  emotion,  self-consciousness\nand reflection. That is, by writing in the first person,  autoethnography  enables  the  researcher  to\n\u201cconnect the personal to the cultural, placing the self  within  a  social  context\u201d  (Reed-Danahay,\n1997).  Therefore, as the paper now moves away from the theoretical understandings and  towards\nmy own personal experiences of autoethnography in research and the opportunities it affords, I too\nwill introduce my own voice and personal narrative.\nACCESSING THE RESEARCHER \u2018SELF\u2019 AND TOURIST \u2018OTHER\u2019\nThe findings of this paper arise from a larger study which thesis sought to renegotiate  the  role  of\nthe visual within the tourist experience; exploring the role of visuals as both mobilising and  being\nmobilised  by  a  series  of  embodied,  political,  reflexive  and  ethical  performances  as   tourists\nanticipate, rewrite and remember place  (see  x,  2009).  Interviews  were  conducted  with  sixteen\nBritish tourists at three stages of their experience: pre-travel, mid-travel and post-travel. Of  these,\nsix were longitudinal and ten were semi-longitudinal (pre-  and  post-travel),  the  remaining  mid-\ntravel interviews were conducted on an ad-hoc basis with UK tourists during their holiday in Peru.\n The sample displayed an even division of men and women  and  included  a  wide  range  of  ages\nfrom early twenties to those in their sixties and seventies. All tourists travelled to Peru as part of  a\ntwo to three week organised small-group tour. Respondents were accessed via tour operators  who\ndistributed research information leaflets with client\u2019s final confirmation documents. Leaflets  were\nalso distributed directly  to  potential  respondents  at  tour  operator  slideshow  presentations  and\ntravel exhibitions.\nTourists\u2019 engagement with visuals at  each  stage  of  the  tourist  experience  was  explored  using\ntourist brochures, postcards and tourists own photographs they select  to  share  as  best  reflecting\ntheir  experiences  of  anticipating  place,  or  of   selectively   rewriting   and   remembering   their\nexperiences. Indeed, it should be noted  that  while  the  nature  of  the  wider  research  positioned\nphotography as the medium of knowledge sharing, respondents were  not  discouraged  to  discuss\nthe alternative ways in touristic experiences were performed. Nevertheless, while  one  respondent\n(Gillian) created scrapbooks of material traces such  as  tickets,  maps  and  receipts,  for  all  other\nrespondents, photography remained the  sole,  principle  activity  in  their  performances  of  place.\nIndeed, while beyond the scope of this paper,  future  work  on  visual  autoethnography  need  not\nremain  confined  to  photography,  but  may  extend  to  embrace  video  diaries  and  other  visual\npractice  such  as  scrapbooking.  Likewise,  in  exploring  the  range  of  touristic  expression,  the\nopportunity also exists  for  further  research  into  areas  such  as  audio-autoethnographies  where\nevocative experiences are shared using alternative representations such as music or poetry.\nTo  gain  autoethnographic  insights,  I  became  \u201cresearcher-as-tourist\u201d  during  my   fieldwork.   I\ntravelled with my partner on our own two-week holiday around Peru that followed the same  route\nas respondents had experienced. Like respondents, I too held and shared my anticipations of  place\nand followed the tourist trail and engaged in similar activities that they  may  have  encountered.  I\nate traditional Peruvian cuisine and listened to the Andean  musicians  alongside  other  tourists  in\nrestaurants. I walked the Inca Trail, purchased  and  sent  postcards  and  felt  the  compulsion  and\nobligation  to  photograph  both  the  appealing  and  unsettling  aspects  cultures  and  landscapes,\nincluding Machu Picchu (see Figure 2). Practices of observation by doing  therefore  established  a\nfirst-hand appreciation and understanding of Peru through which I, as researcher, accessed  deeper\nconnection and understanding with respondents (Angorosino & Mays Perez, 2000).  The  focus  of\nobservation did not centre on following respondents as they moved in and around  Peru.  Rather,  I\nimmersed my self within my own practices in order to gain a deeper appreciation for the  range  of\nattitudes, habits, emotions and skills respondents may experience as they anticipated,  experienced\nand remembered their journey to Peru.\n* Please insert figure 2 about here\nSubsequently, by reflecting upon first-hand experiences and sharing respondents\u2019  photographs  of\ntheir holidays in Peru, interviews become rich negotiations as researcher positionality moves from\nresearcher  to  researcher-as-fellow-tourist.  Attention  now  turns  to   the   application   of   visual\nautoethnography  as  I  explore  the  ways  in  which  intersubjectivity  facilitates  the  \u201csharing   of\nspeech\u201d and the \u201csounds of silence\u201d.\nSHARING OF SPEECH: ARTICULATING EMBODIED PERFORMANCES\nFirst, drawing upon research by Scarles & Sanderson (2007), visual autoethnography provides  the\nopportunity for sharing speech as spaces open through  which  respondents  are  able  to  articulate\nembodied performances. Radley & Taylor (2003) suggest conversations emerge as researcher  and\nrespondent make readings of visuals together. However, unlike elicitation, visual autoethnography\nmobilises togetherness as moments of mutual encounter erode boundaries between researcher  and\nrespondent through shared articulation of experiences of place as pictured. As I became researcher-\nas-tourist,  many  respondents  commented  on  the  \u2018travel  connection\u2019  or   \u2018understanding\u2019   that\nemerged  between  us.  For  some,  such  connection  was  juxtaposed  against  the   frustration   of\narticulating the intensity of experiences when sharing  photographs  and  experiences  with  family\nand friends: \u201cwhen you are showing other people, you would look at the best bit first and then  it\u2019s\njust a bit boring after that\u2026it wouldn\u2019t be for you or me because  we  have  been  there.  It  means\nsomething\u201d (Martin). Visuals therefore become gateways for expressing a deeper  appreciation  of\nthe multiplicity of attitudes, habits, sentiments, emotions, sensibilities and preferences of  tourists\u2019\nexperiences. Where respondents  used  photographs  to  express  their  elation  at  reaching  Machu\nPicchu (Maggie), their disgust or delight at eating cuy (roast guinea pig) (Gillian), their wonder  at\nthe array of food stuffs in the markets or the brightly coloured clothes, their shock and  sadness  at\nthe families living in poverty (Les) or even the pain  in  their  feet  as  they  trekked  the  Inca  trail\n(Abbi), I too was able to share in their response as I recalled and  shared  my  own  experiences  of\nmy time spent doing similar activities.\nSuch expression of mutuality draws parallels with Roland Barthes\u2019 theory of anchorage and  relay.\nFor Barthes (1977), anchorage relates to text accompanying images that allow readers to  \u201cchoose\nthe correct level of  perception\u201d  as  it  \u201cpermits  me  to  focus  not  simply  my  gaze  but  also  my\nunderstanding\u201d (p.  39),  thus  minimising  the  potential  of  misinterpretation.  Therefore,  within\nvisual autoethnography, visuals and the accompanying narrative serve  to  secure  experiences  via\nthe mimesis of that pictured. However, as  conversations  continue,  the  polysemic  nature  of  the\nvisual and opportunities for relay come to the fore.  For Barthes, the concept of relay exists as:\n\u201ctext and image stand in a complementary relationship; the words, in the same way as the\nimages, are fragments of a more general syntagm and unity of the message is realised at a\nhigher level, that of the story, the anecdote, the diegesis\u201d (p. 41).\nThe  role  of  the  photograph  as  a  visual  fragment  of  experience  becomes  central;   anchoring\nconversation while simultaneously opening the possibility of exploring experiences  beyond  those\npictured. Subsequently, conservation emanates from the visual as researcher  and  respondent  find\ncommonality through  mutual  experience  of  similar  encounters  and  relay  is  manifest  through\nshared stories and anecdotes.\nThrough visual autoethnography, researchers are no longer removed or distanced, but are  situated\nwithin research, geographically, socially, culturally, economically and politically. Our  bodies  are\ncommitted to conversational exchanges through self-witnessing as we share intimate  moments  of\nself as practised. As research seeks to unpack  the  \u201cfelt,  touched  and  embodied  constitutions  of\nknowledge\u201d  (Crang,  2003,  p.  501),  respondents  are   supported   and   understood   by   mutual\nappreciation. Such appreciation and connection is exemplified as Angela  shared  her  experiences\nof the Nasca Desert (see Figure 3):\nAngela:   \u201cI mean this is an example of the sort of place  where  I  would  take  to\u2026illustrate\nhow I was feeling. It was just so  empty  and\u2026that  signifies  that  to  me,  its  like\npeople were here once and now they are not\nInterviewer:  and it\u2019s so small in itself and there is no one there\nAngela:       yeah and I  was  feeling  very  tiny  at  that  point  because  it  was  just  such  an\nenormous situation\nInterviewer:  that\u2026made me\u2026now I feel really quite\u2026kind of vulnerable almost\u201d\n*Please insert Figure 3 about here\nBarriers  of  discomfort  and  unease  are   permeated   and   opportunities   to   explore   embodied\nencounters of place emerge as the visual creates a bridge  between  the  experiences  of  researcher\nand respondent. Consequently, the conversation  with  Angela  moved  to  explore  issues  such  as\nopening of the graves of the Nasca people, imagined histories and the deep intensity, vastness  and\nvulnerability of self in the desert that I too had experienced. Thus, conversations are  enlivened  as\nresearcher  and  respondent   engage   in   enriched   communication;   sharing   intricate   feelings,\nreflections and emotions of the tourist experience. Our conversation continued:\nAngela:   \u201c(it\u2019s) an amazing place, it just sort of came crashing home to me  how  dangerous\na place it was\u2026(the)second driest place in the world,  we  were  out  there,  there\nwas a wind whipping across  the  plane  so  it  didn\u2019t  feel  hot  and  you  are  just\nthinking I am  dehydrating so fast if they drove off and left  me  it  would  be  two,\nthree hours and that\u2019s it, that\u2019s all I could hang on for. Plus these rocks  were  so\nbeautiful, the colours were lovely and that, I mean this is an example  of  the  sort\nof place where I would take to\u2026illustrate how I was feeling. It was just so  empty\nand that, that signifies that to me, it\u2019s like people were here  once  and  now  they\nare not\u2026.and I was feeling very tiny at that  point  because  it  was  just  such  an\nenormous situation..., \nInterviewer:   and yet the emotions and feelings and messages\nAngela:   its quite incredible isn\u2019t it,\nInterviewer:   you can convey just through, which in itself is just an empty photograph,\nAngela:   \u2026and this is when it becomes very, very  personal.  I  mean  it\u2019s  different  for  you\nbecause you have been there but if someone else was flicking through  these  they\nwould see a bit of sand, a bit of rock and a little hut. Yeah,  and  it  doesn\u2019t  mean\nanything at all\u201d\nWhile visuals served to  overcome  the  potential  subjective  differences  (e.g.  gender,  race,  age,\nsocial status, profession, etc) that can emerge  through  conversation  and  facilitated  respondents\u2019\nability  to  share  the  embodied,  reflexive  encounters   that   stimulated   the   need   to   take   the\nphotograph, such interpretation should not be assumed to infer an ease of exchange.  Just  as  Rose\n(1997) shared her apprehensions  of  subjectivity  as  one  interviewee  joked  that  he  was  \u201cbeing\ninterviewed for Radio 4\u201d (p.  306),  the  potential  for  clashing  subjectivities  remains  a  constant\nchallenge. My position as a (relatively) young, female academic inevitably  influenced  my  ability\nto strike rapport with respondents who  were  from  a  range  of  age,  gender,  social  and  cultural\nbackgrounds and professions. During the research, some respondents experience  varying  degrees\nof ease or difficulty in expressing themselves and sharing their experiences. Likewise,  differences\nalso invariably arose in the way in which they  engaged  with  photographs  and  photography  and\nsubsequently expressed  their  experiences  during  interviews.  Indeed,  on  seeing  Figure  1,  Les\n(Donna\u2019s husband) commented:\nInterviewer:      we were just talking about how when Donna is looking at the photographs\nshe can imagine Peru and being  there  and  walking  through  the  market  and\nrelates it back to when you were in Tunisia, do you look at images that way?\nLes:      \u2026I think I have got preconceived ideas of what there is there and the images you\nsee in there\u2026.I imagine there will be street markets there in towns which are\npretty much like street markets everywhere else, local people will be selling\nlocal produce, but they will also be trying to sell you touristy things\nInterviewer:   so you read images in relation to other things that you know\u2026and in a way\nyou can, hear the sounds that you might hear because of what you know\nmarkets to sound like or smell like\u2026\nLes:      I don\u2019t think so; no\u2026my preconceptions\u2026are very  much  what  I  have\u2026seen  (on\nthe TV)\"\nDuring interviews, the flow of conversation inevitably varied  between  respondents.  However,  it\nwas through our shared commonalities: a desire to travel, the  importance  of  photography  in  our\ntravel experiences and a seemingly  genuine  interest  in  sharing  experiences,  that  conversations\nemerged as a rich negotiation, sharing and mutual understanding  of  experience.  In  sharing  both\nour commonalities and differences, both I and respondents were no longer imprisoned within a pre-\ndetermined   framework   that   confine   and   restricts   the   flow   of   conversation.   Rather,    in\nacknowledging  differences  in   practices   and   behaviours,   visual   autoethnography   generated\nknowledge that would otherwise remain undisclosed. However,  as  conversations  moved  beyond\nthe  factual  practice  and  process  of  holiday  selection  into  lay  knowledges   and   experiences,\nrespondents often became uncertain or frustrated as words were  no  longer  enough.  In  exploring\nmoments of tacit experience, it  was  not  uncommon  for  discursive  discrepancies  to  emerge  as\nrespondents experienced an inability to verbalise embodied, affectual connections with  place  and\nit is to this that attention now turns.\nSOUNDS OF SILENCE: INHERENT LACKING AND ULTIMATE FAILURE\nWith  sharing  of  speech  also  come  the  sounds  of  silence.   As  visuals  facilitate  moments  of\nreflection, respondents inevitably experience moments of fleeting or  extended  reflection  as  they\nclarify their thoughts or momentarily re-embody themselves in place via reflexive performance (x,\n2009). As conversation moves to explore the tacit moments of embodied,  affectual  performances\nwithin tourism, it is not uncommon for discursive discrepancies  to  arise  as  respondents  become\nunable to express themselves via  dialogue  or  narrative.  As  words  fail,  visual  autoethnography\nopens  the  possibility  of  sounds  of  silence  as  visuals  allow  respondents  to  reflect  upon  and\nimaginatively reignite their  embodied  practices  and  performances  of  place.  As  Orobitg-Canal\n(2004) suggests, \u201cboth photographic content and the narratives photographs evoke,  offer\u2026routes\nto  knowledges  that  cannot  be  achieved  by  verbal  communication\u201d  (p.  38).    The   intangible\ntherefore is expressed through the materiality of the  visual  as  visual  autoethnography  holds  the\npotential to unlock  the  expression  of  encounters  that  would  otherwise  remain  excluded  from\nconversation. Thus, silence sporadically occupies the space of the interview as respondents are left\nunable to verbally convey moments of affectual connection. Such silences should not be  assumed\nas absolute quietness as respondents sit devoid of expression  or  communication.  Rather,  despite\nthe limitations of verbal communication, non-verbal communication generates  sounds  of  silence\nas expression resonates through the visual.\nFirst, the ultimate failure of words can create intense ramblings or alternative moments  of  intense\nfrustration as respondents are left unable to articulate their  feelings.  As  such,  the  limitations  of\nverbal communication may halt or puncture conversation as  respondents  can  only  ever  partially\nimpart the  intensity  of  affectual  connections  to  place.  Therefore,  while  respondents  at  times\ncontinue in their struggle to convey that which they feel, such lacking highlights the importance of\nthe embodied nature of experiences. Sounds of silence therefore arise in what is not said; the  gaps\nin vocabulary or limitations in expression as words  fail  the  needs  of  respondents.  As  Harrison\n(2008) suggests:\n\u201cwe  find  ourselves  always  already  within  patterns  and  regimes  of  truth  as  the  very\nresources which allow us to aggress or disagree. We come to ourselves  already  entwined\nin the unfolding historicity of many such regimes that our  intentions\u2026our  desires,  action\nand words will never have been quite our own\u201d (p. 19).\nTherefore, as respondents struggle to find the words to convey their experience, they become  tied\nto  the  confines  of  discursive   expression   and   collective   expression.   Such   containment   is\nexemplified by Olivia as she attempts to convey her experience on the Altiplano:\nit just really captures what I am not able to put into words sometimes\u2026.it was  a  beautiful\nview, the sunlight, the way it was\u2026on (the) mountains\u2026you just you have  got  that  lovely\nsun  and  the   surrounding   peace\u2026it\u2019s   utter   silence\u2026you   could   almost   record   the\nsilence\u2026its so different\u2026you cant put it into words and I am going to run out of adjectives\n(see Figure 4).\nAs I reflected upon my own experiences of the Altiplano, conversation continued:\nInterviewer:  and it\u2019s moments like that that you don\u2019t photograph\nOlivia:      it is because you don\u2019t want to spoil it or something but\u2026you can\u2019t  get  it  here\nnow\n                             and yes, ok you can go walking in the mountains, but you don\u2019t seem to have  an\nabsolute\n                            silence or feeling that there is nobody else..\nInterviewer: total isolation\nOlivia:     total isolation that\u2019s it, it\u2019s weird and that\u2019s what we want to try and  capture  in\nphotographs\n    but we do up to a point\nInterviewer: yeah but then there\u2019s the point where it stops working\u2026\n*Please insert Figure 4 about here\nSecondly, sounds of silence can arise as respondents abandon attempts at verbal expression. While\nsuch silences can inevitably create discomfort, awkwardness and fractures in  conversation,  visual\nautoethnography holds the potential to  ignite  non-verbal  communication  as  silence  is  replaced\nwith an unspoken \u2018knowing\u2019 between respondent and  researcher.  As  Angrosino  &  Mays  Perez\n(2000) suggest, body language and gestural clues come to lend meaning to  words  and  responses.\nIn observing and responding to respondents\u2019 bodily reactions, researchers gain deeper  insights  as\ntheir embodied reflexive performances, ignited by engagement with the visual,  communicate  that\nwhich words can not. In such  moments  of  silent  contemplation,  photographs  redirect  attention\naway from my presence and become vessels for self-reflection as visuals become co-performers in\nrespondents\u2019 reflection (Holm, 2008; Scarles, 2009). Whether fleeting  or  extended,  moments  of\ncontemplative silence not only  enable  respondents  to  clarify  thoughts  (Kamler  &  Threadgold,\n2003, Pink, 2001), but offer opportunity to relive past  experiences  as  shared  with  researcher  as\nthat-which-has-been  (Barthes,  1977)  is  reignited  within  the  space  of  the   interview.   Visuals\nbecome pathways into  \u201cunderstanding  the  immediacy  of  experience\u201d  (Scarles,  2009:  x),  that\nrecognises experiences \u201cnot just as a physical setting, but an orientation,  a  feeling,  a  tendency\u201d\n(Radley  &  Taylor,  2003,  p.  24).  Thus,  reflective  performances  through  visuals   can   launch\nmoments that express corporeal uniqueness as emotions exceed expression in language  and  erupt\ninto gesture (Elkins, 1998; Mulvey, 1986).\n* Please insert Figure 5 about here\nSharing her experiences of an encounter with local children during a visit to a  school  (see  Figure\n5), Sarah reflected:\n\u201cthese guys are laughing because they are getting balloons,  fruit,  pencils.  He  is  singing\nme a song, they stood there and\u2026they got things, they  did  another  one,  they  got  things,\nthere\u2019s another picture I have with the kids running down the street and I am thinking \u201coh,\nJesus do I have enough?\u201d\u2026but so many kids that we gave things to, I mean  when  we  got\nright out into the country and we were giving them sweeties we had to show  them  how  to\nunwrap that, anyway\u2026(gets very upset and stops talking)\u201d\nVery quickly, emotions took over as Sarah fought back her  tears:  the  embodied  intensity  of  the\nmemory taking over. However, I too had met children living in similar conditions  to  those  Sarah\nhad photographed. I became absorbed in my personal reflection;  sympathetic  to  the  intensity  of\nher reflections as the children in the photograph reminded me of those I had met and her emotions\ntriggered and mediated my  own  reflexive  performance.  We  sat  together  in  silence,  sharing  a\nfeeling: a sadness and humble appreciation. Words failed and  silence  prevailed  as  Sarah\u2019s  tears\nand sadness filled the space of the interview. Our attention turned to  the  visual  that  lay  between\nus. Indeed, while advocates of photo-elicitation talk of  the  comfort,  security  and  contemplation\noffered  to  respondents  by  photographs  (Harper,   2002),   with   visual   autoethnography   such\nreassurance and comfort is also experienced by the researcher as I too found solace  of  reflexivity\nthrough Sarah\u2019s photograph. Indeed, had figure 5 not been present, such  reflexive  affinity  would\nhave remained beyond the grasp of the research encounter.\nAs words fail, betweenness emerges as respondent  and  researcher  share  a  vulnerability  of  self\n(Behar, 1996; Reed-Danahay, 1997). Vulnerability does not manifest as  threat  or  exploitation  of\nthe physical self, but rather materialises as the corporeality of vulnerability (Harrison, 2008). It \u201cis\nnot the antithesis of strength,  imperviousness  or  resistance\u201d,  but  \u201cdescribes  the  inherent  and\ncontinuous susceptibility of corporeal life to the unchosen and the unforeseen\u201d (ibid, p.  5).  Thus,\nwithin visual autoethnography, a mutual vulnerability emerges as both researcher  and  respondent\nopen their selves to each other; each revealing emotions and opening intimacies to the  scrutiny  of\nothers. The visual becomes  a  vessel  through  which  vulnerability  becomes  a  condition  of  the\nresearch connection. It offers stability, security and comfort. Mutual vulnerability realised through\ntrust transposes spaces of doubt: a bond  that  joins  researcher  and  respondent  as  \u201ctourists-who-\nhave-travelled-to-Peru\u201d. The visual becomes a space of shared  corporeal  expressions  that  reveal\nemotions and open intimacies of self as exchange moves into  the  realms  of  sensate  life  (Smith,\n2001, cit. Cloke et al., 2003).\nThus,  the  ultimate  failure  of  verbal  expression  should  not  be  misinterpreted  as  the  end   of\ncommunication;  a  hopeless  dead-end  from  which  researchers  and  respondents   must   retreat.\nRather, by combining visuals with autoethnography, where  words  fail,  visuals  ignite  and  (non-\nverbal)  communication  continues.  As  aforementioned,  a   negotiation   of   selves   emerges   as\nboth researcher and respondent bring  personal  experiences,  insights  and  understandings  of  the\nissues raised to the space of the interview. Whether conveying their awe at the first site  of  Machu\nPicchu, the vastness of the altiplano or the sense of achievement at reaching a mountain summit, it\nis the intensity of frustrations, the vexation and ultimate hopelessness of representation  expressed\nby many respondents that emphasises the importance of moments  of  non-representation.  It  is  in\nsuch moments that doing, becoming and the role of somatic knowledges enriches  findings  (Thrift\n& Dewsbury, 2000). Thus, visual autoethnography facilitates poetic continuations that  bridge  the\ngap between the represented and non-representable.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs tourism research moves  to  explore  the  embodied  performances  of  tourism,  this  paper  has\nexplored the role of visual autoethnography  as  contributing  to  a  new  orthodoxy  of  qualitative\nmethods  to  access  embodied,  sensual  and  emotional  experiences  of   the   tourist   experience.\nResponding to authors such as Pink (2007),  it proposes that in order to realise the potential of  the\nvisual within methodological practice, it is necessary to reposition visuals as  pathways  to  and  of\nmultisensual encounter; tools for complementing, reinforcing  and  sharing  the  visualities  of  the\npractices and processes of  both  their  production  and  consumption.  Offering  a  combination  of\nphoto-elicitation and autoethnography, visual autoethnography provides a route to access both  the\ntangible  and  intangible   spaces   of   embodied   performance   as   reflexivity   extends   to   both\nrespondents and researchers and knowledge is shared through a  merging  of  subjectivities  within\nthe space of the interview. It therefore holds considerable potential for  research  into  experiential\nelements of tourism such as: tourists\u2019  experiences  of  destinations  and  practices  within  specific\ncontexts (e.g.  Andriotis  (2009)  and  Belhassen,  Caton  &  Stewart  (2008)\u2019s  work  on  religious\ntourism, or Maher, Steel & MacIntosh (2003)\u2019s work on tourism in  Antarctica),  tourists  attitudes\n(e.g. Mohsin, 2005) and awareness (e.g. Becken, 2007), or identity  construction  in  tourism  (e.g.\nPalmer, 2005) to name but a few.\nIn visual autoethnography, both respondents and researchers therefore move to  occupy  an  active\nrole in the emotional and transformative process of research as the materiality of the  image  offers\na fragment of self as  performed.  Thus,  the  tangibility  of  the  visual  allows  respondents  to  re-\nenliven a range of wholly embodied and sensual  habits,  practices  and  behaviours  of  the  tourist\nexperience.  Researcher  subjectivity  becomes  central  to  accessing  and  sharing  the  embodied,\nsensual  performances  of  the  tourist  experience.  Drawing  upon  well-rehearsed  calls  for  self-\nreflexivity in research, visual autoethnography facilitates the move to resituate the  \u2018I\u2019  in  research\n(Krieger, 1996). As  a  method,  it  mobilises  a  blend  of  subjectivities  via  the  process  of  self-\nwitnessing as researchers commit their body to  the  field,  realising  knowledges  and  experiences\nthrough a fusion of observation and first-hand experiences. By fusing researcher autoethnographic\nand  respondent  experiences,   conversations   emerge   as   a   negotiation   of   subjectivities;   an\nintersubjective way-finding (Thrift & Pile, 1995) as  both  researcher  and  respondent  share  first-\nhand experiences. Visuals therefore provide a bridge as researcher and respondent  merge  through\nintersubjective exchange; an active, dynamic co-construction that seeks to explore, understand and\nchallenge existing knowledges of both practice of tourism and research.\nIn  merging  subjectivities,  visual  autoethnography  gives  rise  to  the  \u201csharing  of  speech\u201d   and\n\u201csounds of silence.  With regard to the sharing of speech, spaces of shared articulation  emerge  as\nvisual  autoethnography  enriches   the   fluidity   and   dynamism   of   intersubjective   exchange.\nArticulation is no longer confined to verbal expression, but unfolds through  the  fusion  of  verbal\nand non-verbal communication. The visual therefore becomes a platform  for  sharing  encounters;\nfacilitators of mutual exchange that ignites conversation. Drawing upon Barthes (1977) concept of\nanchorage  and  relay,  the  paper  suggests  visuals  provide  the  focal  point  of  conversation   as\nresearcher and respondent find commonality through mutual experience of  similar  encounters  to\nthose pictured.  However, it is via relay that negotiations of subjective experience  reveal  nuances\nand intricacies of experience. Consequently, visual autoethnography mobilises a  togetherness:  an\nunderstanding  and   connection   as   subjectivities   co-join   as   tourists-who-have-been-to-Peru.\nKnowledge and insight unfold  in  the  immanence  of  the  interview  as  conversation  transcends\nsurface level exchange as researcher and respondent identify  moments  of  mutual  understanding,\nexperience and appreciation. Thus,  visual  autoethnography  opens  spaces  within  which  deeper,\nnuanced and affectual knowledges are expressed as subjective experiences are shared.\nHowever, with speech also come the sounds of silence. As Radley & Taylor (2003)  suggest,  it  is\nthe presence of  the  visual  in  the  interview  environment  that  allows  respondents  to  not  only\ndescribe their surroundings and experiences, but to convey orientations,  feelings  and  tendencies.\nWhere words fail, visuals become vessels of  self-reflection  and  co-performers  in  the  emerging\nintersubjective exchange. Silences reverberate with  sound,  unspoken  embodied  knowledges,  as\nvisuals launch moments of corporeal uniqueness  that  erupt  into  gesture  as  our  bodies  become\ncentral not only to the experiences  and  encounters  as  relived  and  shared.  Both  researcher  and\nrespondent become vulnerable as they expose their selves; each finding solace within the visual as\nthey come together in sharing the intensities of emotions, somatic knowledges  and  haptic  spaces\nof  encounter.  Through  the  intersubjective  exchange  afforded   by   visual   autoethnography   a\nbetweenness emerges between respondent and researcher that goes  beyond  words  as  they  come\ntogether to reach that which cannot be verbally expressed. In  doing  so,  intersubjective  exchange\nmaterialises as shared corporeal expression as the immanence of encounter opens intimacies of the\nself and where words fail, visuals ignite.\nReferences\nAdkins,  L.
