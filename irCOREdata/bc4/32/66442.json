A number of theories have been advanced to\nexplain the phenomenon of exchange biasing, all based on\nforms of interface coupling. Most models assume that the\nAFM and FM anisotropy axes are collinear and that the AFM\nspins at the interface are uncompensated.2,3 The simple mod-\nels give rise to a bias field that is too high. Malozemoff4\nproposed a model with random exchange interactions that\nresulted in a lower bias field and Mauri et al.5 suggested that\nformation of antiferromagnetic domains parallel to the inter-\nface would also reduce the bias field. More recently a micro-\nmagnetic calculation by Koon6 suggested that the coupling\nbetween AFM and FM spins across a frustrated, but compen-\nsated, interface is perpendicular. There exists a canting of the\nAFM spins close to the interface that decays away within a\nfew monolayers of the interface. For an antiferromagnetic\nexchange interaction, the canting is such as to create a small\nnet moment on the AFM layer in the opposite sense to the\nFM magnetization. Kiwi et al.7 have postulated a canted\nAFM interface structure coupled with an incomplete domain\nwall in the FM layer.\nIn recent experiments evidence in support of both paral-\nlel and perpendicular spin alignment was found. Takano\net al.3 found evidence of uncompensated spins in CoO\/MgO\nand CoO\/Ni81Fe19 and support for Malozemoff\u2019s model.\nNeutron scattering experiments of Ijiri et al.8 on Fe3O4 \/CoO\nsuperlattices and magnetic measurements of Nogue\u00b4s et al.9\non Fe\/FeF2 can be interpreted in terms of Koon\u2019s spin-\ncanting model. On the other hand, direct observation by\npolarization-dependent x-ray magnetic dichroism spectromi-\ncroscopy of Co on LaFeO3, showed that grain by grain the\nalignment of FM spins was parallel to the underlying AFM\nspin orientation.10\nLike polarized neutron scattering, x-ray resonant mag-\nnetic scattering may be used to probe the magnetization of\nthin films. Although the x-ray technique cannot as yet deter-\nmine the absolute value of the magnetization, it is element\nspecific and Freeland et al.11 have shown how this feature\ncan be exploited to identify the order of layer switching in a\nNiFe\/Cu\/Co spin valve. Switching of the helicity of the in-\ncident x-ray beam results in a change in the intensity if a\ncomponent of ferromagnetic moment lies in the incidence\nplane, the difference being a signal proportional to the mag-\nnitude of this magnetization component. For a perfectly com-\npensated antiferromagnetic lattice, the difference signal will\nalways be zero. However, we note that in experiments on\nFe25Co75 \/Mn\/Fe25Co75 trilayers, Chakarian et al.12 did detect\na net moment on the Mn layer, oriented 23\u00b0 to the Co and Fe\nmoments. Further, a weak moment was detected by resonant\nmagnetic scattering on thin epitaxial Fe75Mn25 films grown\non Ir~001! substrates.13 However, in more recent experiments\nusing magnetic circular dichroism on Co\/FeMn bilayers it\nwas found that the Mn spins are almost perfectly compen-\nsated for with no more than a few percent of one monolayer\nof residual ferromagnetic spins.14 We report here resonant\nmagnetic x-ray scattering experiments on NiFe\/Cu\/Co\/IrMn\nwhich provide evidence for the existence of a small ferro-\nmagnetic moment on the antiferromagnetic layer in this sys-\ntem.\nSoft x-ray resonant magnetic scattering experiments\nwere performed at room temperature and in fields up to 70\nmT on the Dragon beamline ID12B at the European Syn-\nchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble. The Helios-type he-\nlical undulator delivers two separate beams of x rays, each\nbeing between 80% and 90% circularly polarized, but in op-\nposite senses. By displacement of a pinhole under the control\nof the station computer, the helicity of the x rays incident on\nthe sample can be switched in a matter of seconds. Provided\nthat a few minutes is allowed to elapse, enabling the thermal\nload to stabilize on the spherical grating monochromator, the\nnormalized magnetization component in the incidence plane\ncan be extracted reproducibly from the difference in the in-\ntensity for the two helicities.

Vibrating magneto-\nmeter measurements on the samples showed classic spin-\nvalve behavior with an exchange field of 40 and 50 ~65! mT,\nrespectively, for the two samples.\nAlthough the penetration depth of these soft x rays is\nlimited, we have shown previously15 that it is possible to\nprobe 1000 \u00c5 thick Cu\/Co multilayers. Figure 1 shows the\nreflectivity from the sample with the thinner IrMn pinning\nlayer recorded at the Co L3 edge for both helicities. At high\nscattering angles the shape of the reflectivity curve is domi-\nnated by fringes originating from the tantalum buffer layer,\nshowing a penetration depth greater than the total sample\nthickness. The net ferromagnetic moment of the cobalt layer\nis clear from the difference in intensity between the reflec-\ntivity curves recorded using the two opposite helicities.\nAt the Mn L3 edge no obvious difference in the two full\nspecular reflectivity curves can be detected upon reversal of\nthe helicity. However, careful measurement across the specu-\nlar ridge, made by scanning only the sample ~Fig. 2!, does\nreveal a small, reproducible, change in intensity (DI\n;0.04) upon reversal of the helicity that is substantially\nweaker, and only just above the noise level (DI;0.001)\nwhen the monochromator energy is tuned 20 eV below the\nMn L3 edge. The signal falls upon moving away from the\nedge to either higher or lower energies. As in previous soft\nx-ray resonant magnetic scattering experiments, this provides\nunequivocal evidence that a small net moment exists on the\nantiferromagnetic layer.\nMeasurements as a function of field were taken at a spe-\ncific scattering vector, chosen such that the change in signal\nupon reversal of the helicity was large. By selecting a spe-\ncific wave vector transfer the flipping ratio may be used to\nplot the magnetization curve as a function of the field. In this\ncase the sample was oriented with the easy direction of mag-\nnetization, determined by the growth field direction, perpen-\ndicular to the incidence plane.\nWith positive helicity and with the sample set on the\nspecular ridge at a wavevector transfer of 0.16 \u00c521, the ap-\nplication of a 164 mT field resulted in a 9.9% decrease in\nthe signal intensity at the Co edge. Application of a 264 mT\nfield resulted in an 11% increase at the Co edge, indicating\nthat the easy direction was not oriented exactly perpendicular\nto the scattering plane ~Fig. 3!. This small net component of\nthe magnetization in the scattering plane accounts for the two\ndifferent \u2018\u2018zero states\u2019\u2019 that are shown in Fig. 3. The curve\ncorresponds to a hard axis magnetization loop of the Co\nlayer and is in good agreement with the equivalent magneti-\nzation curve measured in a vibrating sample magnetometer\nwhen the component of magnetization associated with the\nvery low field switching of the Ni80Fe20 layer is subtracted.\nUpon application of the 164 mT field, no change in\nintensity was observed at the Mn edge, but in the 264 mT\nfield, a 1.5% reduction was observed, revealing a change in\nthe moment on the IrMn layer in the opposite sense to that in\nthe Co layer. The reduction occurred each time that the 264\nmT field was applied and the size of the signal change was\nindependent of the field. Reversal of the phase and the direc-\ntion of the trickle current in the electromagnet gave a de-\ncrease, after significant irreproducible \u2018\u2018training,\u2019\u2019 16 in the\nMn edge signal in a 164 mT field as the in-plane AF do-\nmains reorder. In all cases, changes in the Mn edge signal\nwere in the opposite sense to those at the Co edge ~Fig. 4!.\nFIG. 1.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/apl.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nThe observation of a net AFM moment oriented oppo-\nsitely to the moment in the FM Co layer is in agreement with\nunpublished x-ray resonant scattering experiments at the Ni\nL3 edge by Kao.17 Measurement of the scattered intensity of\ncircularly polarized radiation as a function of the field in the\neasy direction of a spin valve showed a small net moment on\nthe NiO exchange pinning layer and a reversed, square loop\nassociated with it. An induced moment on the AFM layer\nwas observed in Fe\u2013FeF2 and Fe\u2013MnF2 bilayers by Nogue\u00b4s\net al.18 using high resolution superconducting quantum inter-\nference device ~SQUID! magnetometry, the sense of the cou-\npling depending on the microstructure and on the field in\nwhich the sample was cooled through the Ne\u00b4el temperature.\nWe can attempt to interpret the presence of the net mag-\nnetic moment on the AFM layer, either in terms of an un-\ncompensated layer of spins at the interface3 or a net moment\ndue to canting of the AFM spins close to the interface.4,7\nDespite not being able to quantify the size of the moment\ndue to lack of knowledge of the resonant magnetic cross\nsection, the signal magnitude is not inconsistent with a single\nlayer of spins. In the former case, we note that a small net\nmoment arises only when there is an odd number of spins\nthrough the AFM layer. Roughness that is fully correlated\nthrough the AFM layer19 does not affect the size of the mo-\nment, but uncorrelated roughness will average the effect to\nzero. Variation of the AFM layer thickness by more than one\nAFM unit cell will also average the net moment to zero.\nRoughness at the interface is of this order, and it is only in\nthe case of totally correlated roughness that the effect can be\nobserved. It is thus difficult to understand the origin of the\nobserved moment in terms of an uncompensated surface\nlayer. However, magnetometric and ferromagnetic resonance\nstudies of exchange bias in Ir20Mn80 films suggested that a\nspin-flop model did not explain the data.20 Our measure-\nments as a function of the field applied in the hard direction\nindicate asymmetry in the rotation of such an interfacial mo-\nment. The moment changes seen in Figs. 3 and 4 occur over\nsimilar, rapid time scales. In both cases the changes in inten-\nsity occurred within the time resolution of the experiment\n~0.5 s!. Unlike our previously studied Co\/Cu multilayers, no\nmagnetic viscosity effects were observed.21 These changes\ncannot therefore be associated with the large scale AF do-\nmain reorientation that is postulated as being the origin of\nthe time-dependent effects on the coercivity reported by\nLaidler and co-workers.22 Nevertheless, the field dependence\ncannot be explained by a uniform rotation of the Mn mo-\nment. The present results provide further evidence for a net\nmoment on the AFM layer but unfortunately do not provide\na definitive test of the competing models.\nThe splendid support of the staff of beamline ID12B at\nthe ESRF is gratefully acknowledged and the authors are\nindebted to Dr. Frances Quinn and Dr. Mark Roper of CLRC\nDaresbury Laboratory for loan of the diffractometer.
