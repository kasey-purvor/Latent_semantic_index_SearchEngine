During the period of development when myelination is \noccurring white matter astrocytes are particularly sensitive to ischemic injury and \ntheir failure to regulate glutamate during ischemic conditions may be an important \nfactor in excitotoxicit injury. Here, we have identified key mechanisms of injury that \noperate on the processes of immature white matter astrocytes during oxygen-glucose \ndeprivation (OGD) using GFAP-GFP mice. OGD produced a parallel loss of astrocyte \nprocesses and somata, assessed by both the retention of GFP fluorescence within these \nstructures and by quantitat ve electron microscopy. OGD-induced process loss was \nCa2+-independent and had two distinct mechanisms. Substituting either extracellular \nNa+ or Cl-, or perfusion with the Na-K-Cl co-transport blocker bumetanide provided \nprotection up to 40 min of OGD but not beyond that point. HCO3- substitution or \nperfusion with 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid (DIDS) provided \ncomplete protection of the processes up to 60 min of OGD. Zero-Na+ \/ zero-K+\nconditions provided complete protection from OGD-induced injury of processes and \nsomata at all time points. We conclude that acute ischemic-type injury of immature \nastrocytes follows a cytotoxic ion influx mediated in part by Na-K-Cl co-transport and \nin part by Na+ and K+ dependent HCO3- transport, a mechanism that is common to \nboth cell processes and somata.

They have a complex morphology \nwith numerous, often highly ramified, cell processes radiating from the soma to \nlocations such as the node of Ranvier, the peri-synaptic space, peri-vascular space and \nthe glial limitans (Butt and Ransom 1993; Grosche et al. 1999; Skoff 1990; Vaughn \n1969). Individual astrocytes are required to perform different functions at these \nvarious locations, and consequently astrocyte processes have a polar distribution of \nmembrane proteins. For example, potassium channels are differentially expressed on \nastrocyte processes, allowing spatial regulation of extracellular [K+] (Newman 1986), \nwhile high-affinity glutamate transporters are differentially expressed in peri-synaptic \nprocesses allowing for effective neurotransmitter re-uptake at these sites (Gundersen \net al. 1996). It is possible that the differential expression of membrane proteins in \nastrocyte processes, coupled to their large membrane to surface area ratio, may give \nthese structures a different sensitivity to ischemic injury from that found in their \nsomata. Loss of processes from astrocytes under ischemic conditions has been \nreported numerous times (Davies et al. 1998; Hulse et al. 2001; Kraig and Chesler \n1990; Thomas et al. 2004), although it is currently not known if injury mechanisms in \nthe processes are distinct from those in the somata or indeed whether injury occurs \nmore rapidly in processes relative to the somata.  \n Ischemia can evoke two basic responses in astrocytes. Astrocytes that \nexperience severe ischemia can quite rapidly suffer irreversible injury leading to \nnecrotic cell death (Fern 1998; Fern 2001; Thomas et al. 2004; Bondarenko and \nChesler 2001), or apoptosis (Giffard and Swanson 2005). Alternatively, astrocytes \nthat survive a period of ischemia can instigate reactive changes involving an increase \nPage 3 of 48\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n4\nin somata size and a thickening of proximal processes (Davies et al. 1998; Ridet et al. \n1997), while the absence of fine processes in reactive astrocytes indicates their \nselective loss from the cell. We have recently reported that astrocytes in immature \nwhite matter are significantly more sensitive to acute ischemic injury than grey matter \nastrocytes (Shannon et al 2007). This may be relevant to developmental disorders \nsuch as cerebral palsy that typically involve selective injury to white matter regions \n(Back and Rivkees 2004; Volpe 1995). Considering the importance of astrocyte \nprocesses for CNS function and the clinical relevance of CNS ischemia, we have now \nexamined the time-course and mechanism of ischemic-type injury to both the \nprocesses and somata of immature white matter astrocytes. Live confocal imaging of \ntransgenic mouse optic nerve with fluorescent GFP expression under the control of \nthe astrocyte specific promoter GFAP allowed real-time assessment of changes in \nastrocyte morphology. Surprisingly, the results show that the mechanism and time-\ncourse of acute injury are the same in both cell compartments and involve a cytotoxic \nionic influx mediated by Na-K-Cl co-transport (NKCC) and HCO3- transporters, \nincluding a putative K-HCO3\u2013 co-transporter. \nMaterials and Methods \n Transgenic mice, strain FVB\/N-Tg(GFAPGFP)14Mes\/J (jax stock number \n003257), carrying GFP (hGFP-S65T) under the control of the human GFAP promoter \nwere used for the confocal imaging studies. Heterozygous males were mated with \nwild type females and transgenic litter mates identified at post partum day 4 (P4) \nusing a blue light source and appropriate filters (the transgenic animals exhibited a \ncharacteristic green glow around their eyes). All animals were maintained in \naccordance with United Kingdom Home Office regulations.

Cell numbers were then expressed as a percentage of the \nnumber present at 0 min for each nerve and an overall percentage obtained by \naveraging the data for all nerves within a treatment group for each time point. To \nassess process loss, mean pixel intensity was measured within a selected region of the \nflattened image stack (200 x 200 x 16 Pm thick) (see Salter and Fern 2005). \nDepending on image quality up to five representative soma-free regions were selected \nper nerve. Mean pixel intensity was measured using MetaMorph and collated in Excel \n(Microsoft, WA). Mean pixel intensity was then normalized to the value recorded at 0 \nmin for that region with a mean percentage taken for all regions measured within that \ntreatment group at each time point. Statistical significance was determined using \nANOVA or T-test, as appropriate (Prism, Graphpad). Data is presented as mean \n\u00b1SEM. \n \nElectron-microscopy \n Optic nerves from P10 GFP-GFAP mice were perfused as above prior to post-\nfixing in 3% gluteraldehyde in Sorenson's solution. Nerves were then post-fixed with \n2% osmium tetroxide and dehydrated prior to infiltration in epoxy. Sections were \ncounterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Jeol 100CX \nelectron microscope (see Thomas et al. 2004 for details). The identity of astrocytes \nwas determined using established criteria which included the presence of wide-bore \nendoplasmic reticulum, glycogen particles, and a characteristic irregular nucleus (Butt \nand Ransom 1993; Grosche et al. 1999; Skoff 1990; Vaughn 1969). Astrocyte process \nlength was measured using Photoshop (Adobe Software), with two nerves examined \nblind for each condition. Process length was measured between the somata and the \nfarthest point on the process that was continuous with the somata. No attempt was \nPage 7 of 48\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n8\nmade to account for the often complex morphology of the processes and just the point \nthat was most distant from the somata was measured. The number of processes that \nextended from each somata was also counted, and the data analyzed in turns of mean \nnumber of processes \/ somata and the mean length of the processes, under the varoius \nconditions. \n \nResults \nImaging of GFAP-GFP Astrocytes in Mouse Optic Nerve \n Optic nerves from mice transgenic for GFP under the control of the human \nGFAP promoter were live maged ex-vivo with a confocal microscope to characterise \nthe morphology of astrocyte somata and processes under control conditions (Zhuo et \nal. 1997). Optic nerves were mounted in a perfusion chamber and imaged at 20 min \nintervals in 1Pm increments from the glial limitans to a depth of 15 Pm, a total of 16 \nimages in each stack. The stacks were then flattened and analysed for process loss and \ncell death. Astrocyte somata, the major processes radiating form the somata and the \nfine distal processes were clearly visible in the image stacks (Fig 2 A). Under control \nconditions where nerves were perfused for 60 min with aCSF both astrocyte somata \nand processes remained stable with fine processes intact and little cell death evident \n(Fig 2 A). Cell process integrity was measured by assessing pixel intensity in defined \nregions that excluded cell soma and overall a ~15% decline was measured after 60 \nmin (to 85.9 \u00b1 2.0% of the initial mean intensity, n= 7 nerves; Fig 2 C).

Process loss was associated \nwith a parallel loss of somata from the nerve (Fig 2 B, arrow), and cell loss reached \nsignificance after 40 min of OGD (Fig 2 D; 66 \u00b14.4% cell loss compared to 4.8 \u00b12.5% \nin control; p<0.001). Beading of processes with the formation of GFP-filled puncta \nwas apparent on occasions (Fig 2 B), a phenomenon that was always associated with \nthe subsequent rapid loss of the somata. It was often the case that weakly fluorescent \ncells were apparent in the nerves, in particular at the end of the period of OGD. These \ncells presumably corresponded to the population of dull cells previously reported \n(Nolte et al. 2001), and appeared to have a high resistance to OGD and were not \nincluded in this study. \n \nFigure 2 near here \n \nThe ultrastructural features of OGD-induced injury were examined in P10 \nGFP-GFAP mice. At this point in development the mouse optic nerve was at a similar \ndevelopmental point to the P10 rat optic nerves we have previously examined \n(Thomas et al. 2004), with the majority of axons pre-myelinated (Fig 3 A, B). In most \ncases, glial cells could be readily identified using established criteria (see Methods \nand Thomas et al. 2004). In control nerves perfused for 60 min in aCSF prior to \nfixation, astrocyte processes radiated from the somata in the form of either thick \nprimary processes or finer processes that originated directly from the somata or \nPage 9 of 48\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n10\nderived from branching of the primary processes. The fine processes, in particular, \ntravelled circuitously around axon profiles (Fig 3 B). Significant pathology was noted \nin nerves fixed after 60 min of OGD (Fig 3 C-H). In particular, examples were found \nwhere the thick proximal processes had detached from the soma (Fig 3 C, D, H \narrows) and thick processes had parted along their length, most frequently in regions \ncontaining large cytoplasmic vacuoles (Fig 3 E, F, arrow head). Examples of \ndisintegrating processes were also found (Fig 3 G, arrows). Separation of astrocyte \nprocesses from the somata was common even in micrographs from regions where \naxonal injury was minimal. For example, the astrocyte shown in Fig 4 A-C is \nsurrounded by numerous isolated sections of cell processes that appear to be \ndisconnected from the somata and each other (e.g., arrows). Examples where small \nprocesses are parting are indicated by arrowheads. An example of a thick process that \nis separating into two sections is shown in Fig 4 D-F. The section that is distal to the \nsomata appears to be membrane delineated (small arrowheads, and note the near-bye \nvacuole), while the proximal section appears open to the extracellular space (arrow). \n \nFigures 3 and 4 near here \n \nValidation of the use of GFP-imaging to Assess Process Loss \n To confirm that the changes in fluorescence seen in Fig 2 are due to loss of \nprocess integrity rather than to fluorescence quenching, a quantitative ultrastructural \nanalysis was performed.

This \ncompares to an equivalent fall of ~60% in the GFP-fluorescence detected in astrocyte \nprocesses which will presumably arise from a combination of these two factors (Fig 2 \nC). The frequency distribution of process length showed the loss of longer processes \nfollowing OGD (Fig 5 C, D). A similar fall in the mean number of processes per \nastrocyte was observed following OGD in the absence of extracellular sodium, but a \nsignificantly smaller reduction in process length was found (Fig 5 A, B, E). This is \nconsistent with the intermediate level of protection observed under zero sodium \nconditions using the GFP-imaging approach as documented in Fig 9. \n It has previously been shown that elevating the extracellular glucose \nconcentration potentiates acid changes produced by anoxia in the optic nerve (Ransom \net al. 1992). The effect of 60 min perfusion with 20 mM glucose\/anoxia are shown in \nFig 5 F-G, which show that this condition has no significant effect upon the integrity \nof processes assessed using the fluorescence technique. Perfusion with sodium \npropionate (20 mM), which will evoke an intracellular acid shift similar to that \nproduced by OGD (Ritucci et al. 1998), was also without significant effect upon \nprocess fluorescence (data not shown). \n \nFigure 5 near here \n \nEffect of Metabolic Poisons \n The effect of complete metabolic arrest was examined, using a combination of \ncyanide (2 mM) and iodacetic acid (1 mM) to block both glycolysis and oxidative \nphosphorlyation.

In the \ncurrent study, initial experiments showed that removing Ca2+ from the extracellular \nspace by perfusing with aCSF to which no Ca2+ had been added and which contained \n70 PM EGTA (\"zero Ca2+\"), resulted in significant damage to processes at 40 min \n(48.3 \u00b14.1% drop in pixel intensity; n= 5 nerves; p<0.001), and 60 min (76.9 \u00b13.1% ; \np<0.001; Fig 7 A, D). Not surprisingly, therefore, zero-Ca2+ conditions failed to \nprotect against OGD-induced process loss (Fig 7 D). To prevent toxicity from Ca2+ \nremoval we employed a low Ca2+ solution (containing a calculated free [Ca2+] of 30 \nPM). This solution was not toxic to astrocyte processes or somata (Fig 7 B, D, E) and \nhad no protective effect against either process loss or soma loss during OGD (Fig 7 C, \nD, E). Nerves showed significant loss of pixel intensity in 30 PM Ca2+ after 40 min of \nOGD (45.8 \u00b15% reduction, n= 5 nerves), a rate of process loss that continued to 60 \nmin. There was no significant difference between results for low Ca2+ ischemia and \naCSF ischemia indicating that injury to processes is not Ca2+ dependent and \nconfirming that cell soma death is also not Ca2+- dependent.  \n \nPage 12 of 48\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n13\nFigure 7 near here \n \nThe Effect of Transport Blockers \nThere is evidence that the Na-K-Cl co-transporter (NKCC) is involved in \ninjury to astrocyte somata via a loss of cell volume regulation (Su et al. 2002a; Su et \nal. 2002b; Thomas et al. 2004), with the NKCC blocker bumetanide giving protection \nagainst soma death during a 40 min period of OGD. The effect of bumetanide (50 \nPM) upon OGD-induced astrocyte process loss was tested, revealing significant \nprotection at 40 min of OGD (n= 6 nerves; p<0.001 vs. OGD) but not at 60 min  \n(p>0.05; Fig 8 A, D).

We did however observe a loss of process integrity at 60 min following \nvisual inspection of images taken of nerves subjected to 60 min OGD in the presence \nof furosemide.  \n \nIonic Dependence of Process Loss in Astrocytes \n Replacing either Na+ or Cl- was found to reduce process loss after 40 min of \nOGD, a protective effect that was lost by 60 min OGD (Fig 9 A, C). When compared \nto control, there was no significant injury to astrocyte processes at 40 min in either \ncase (n = 11 and 5 nerves respectively; p>0.05). However, by 60 min there was an \nacute deterioration of processes with a 43.8 \u00b12.9% loss of pixel intensity in the \nabsence of Na+ (p<0.001 vs., control), and a 54.8 \u00b15.7% loss of pixel intensity in the \nabsence of Cl- (p<0.001 vs., control). Consistent with previous results, either Na+ or \nCl- substitution was highly protective of the astrocyte somata (compare Fig 9 D with \nFig 2 D). We also looked at the effect of removing K+ from the media during OGD. \nWe saw an immediate impact under these conditions with a 22.3 \u00b15.8% drop in pixel \nintensity after 20 min of OGD (Fig 9 B, C; n= 5 nerves, p<0.01 vs., control), which \nalong with exposure to ischemic conditions in zero-Ca2+ was one of only two \noccasions in which we observed a significant effect at this time point. By 40 min there \nwas a catastrophic loss of processes compared to control with a 78.7 \u00b12.8% (p<0.001) \ndrop in pixel intensity and the astrocytes continued to deteriorate through to 60 min \n(Fig 9 C).

In contrast, there was no significant loss of cell somata (Fig \n9 D). Neither Na+ nor Cl- substitution had any significant effect upon astrocyte \nprocesses under control conditions (Fig 9 E), and the toxic effect of K+-substitution \nwas blocked by the co-substitution of either of these ions (Fig 9 F). K+-substitution \ntherefore evokes process injury that is dependent upon both Na+ and Cl-, presumably \ninvolving some form of cytotoxic volume change (e.g., Goldberg and Choi 1993). \n The data show complete protection of astrocyte processes by the Cl- transport \nand channel blocker DIDS, but only partial protection by Cl--substitution. We \ntherefore examined the effect of HCO3- removal by applying a HEPES buffered \naCSF. HCO3--free conditions were found to be completely protective against OGD-\ninduced process and somata loss over 60 min (n= 5 nerves; Fig 10 A, C, D). Since this \nexperiment was performed in otherwise normal aCSF with a Cl- concentration of 131 \nmM this protection can not be due to the loss of a HCO3- component of a Cl-\nconductance. We therefore performed one further experiment to test the protective \neffect of the only major ion remaining that might contribute to injury, K+ (in the \nabsence of Na+ to prevent K+-substitution toxicity). This condition was also \ncompletely protective against OGD-induced astrocyte process (n= 5 nerves; Fig 10 B, \nC) and somata (Fig 10 D) loss. \n \nFigure 10 near here \nPage 15 of 48\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n16\nDiscussion. \nIdentity of GFAP-GFP(+) cells in neonatal optic nerve \n The optic nerve contains cells with neurogenic potential (Palmer et al. 1999), \nand several recent studies have described populations of GFAP(+) neurogenic \nprogenitors. For example, GFAP-GFP(+) cells of the neonatal subventricular zone \nhave been shown to have the potential to differentiate into neural stem cells (Raponi \net al. 2007), while cultures of GFAP(+) cells from P0-P2 brains containing a \npopulation of cells with neurogenic potential (Imura et al. 2006). However, it must be \nborn in mind that GFP-GFAP(+) of the neonatal subventricular zone have many of the \nproperties of mature astrocytes and behave functionally as astrocytes (Liu et al. 2006), \nwhile it is known that GFAP(+) cells of neonatal rodent optic nerve are post-mitotic in \nsitu (Skoff 1990). Furthermore, GFAP-GFP expression in somewhat more mature \noptic nerve is restricted to astrocytes identified on ultrastructural, \nelectrophysiological, morphological and immuno-labeling criteria (Nolte et al. 2001). \nConsistent with this, Steiner et al 2004 have reported that neurogenic hippocampal \nastrocytes become GFAP-GFP(-) prior to expression of the earliest neuronal  markers \n(Steiner et al. 2004). The GFP-GFAP(+) cells examined in the current study therefore \nform a population of mature astrocytes, although possibly containing a small \npopulation of cells that have retained neurogenic potential. \n Consistent with this, GFP-GFAP(+) cells of P10 optic nerve were positive for \nastrocyte markers such as CD44, GFAP and GLT-1, were negative for \noligodendroglial markers such as NG-2 and O4, and were negative for neuronal \nmarkers such as neurofilament, Thy-1 and HuD. We found some GFP-GFAP(+) cells \nthat were CD44(-), which is consistent with prior reports of staining of a sub-\nPage 16 of 48\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n17\npopulation of optic nerve astrocytes (Jones et al. 2000). Interestingly, while all GFP-\nGFAP(+) astrocytes were HuD(-), we observed a large population of HuD(+) cells \nthat appear to be oligodendroglia. This is consistent with prior reports of Hu(+) glia in \nrodent optic nerve (Kostyk et al. 1996). \n \nThe effects of ischemic conditions upon astrocytes \n Using GFP-GFAP mice, we report rapid changes in astrocyte processes in the \nwhole-mount optic nerve during ischemia modelled by OGD. Injury to the processes \nwas significant after 40 min of OGD and pathological changes in their morphology \nwere apparent after 20 min. No protection against injury was afforded to either the \nprocesses or somata of the astrocytes by reducing extracellular Ca2+ to zero or 30 PM, \nwhich confirms an earlier report that acute astrocyte injury is Ca2+-independent \n(Thomas et al. 2004), and extends this paradoxical finding to the processes of the \ncells. This is in contrast to the situation in pre-myelinating white matter astrocytes \n(Fern 1998), neurons (Goldberg and Choi 1993) and oligodendrocytes (Fern and \nMoller 2000; Wilke et al. 2004; Micu et al. 2006; Salter and Fern 2005), where Ca2+ \ninflux is central to acute cell injury during ischemic conditions.  \n In the somata of P10 rat optic nerve astrocytes, acute cell death during 40 min \nof OGD involves cell swelling associated with NKCC activation, which the cells \ncounter by active volume regulation. The subsequent depletion of cellular energy \nreserves results in cell death, apparently by cytotoxic cell swelling (Thomas et al. \n2004). The current findings show that a number of conditions protect astrocyte \nprocesses during the first 40 min of OGD. These include replacing either extracellular \nNa+ or Cl- or perfusion with the selective NKCC blocker bumetanide, data that are \nconsistent with early activation of NKCC and injury to the processes via the same \nPage 17 of 48\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n18\npathway that operates in the somata. However, the conditions that block the NKCC \nonly delay the onset of process injury, which becomes significant after 60 min of \nOGD in zero-Na+, zero-Cl- or bumetanide. In contrast, block of HCO3--transport by \nsubstitution of extracellular HCO3-, or perfusion with the broad-spectrum HCO3--\ntransport blocker DIDS (500 PM), prevented both process and somata death over a 60 \nmin period of OGD. Presumably both DIDS and HCO3--substitution are protective \nduring the first 40 min of OGD through block of HCO3--transporters, indicating that \nDIDS-sensitive HCO3--transport acts in parallel with NKCC, with their combined \naction producing early cytotoxic cell swelling.  \n The situation is different after 60 min of OGD, where zero-Na+, zero-Cl- or \nbumetanide are no longer protective and NKCC is presumably no longer a significant \ncause of cytotoxicity. Conversely, the prolonged protection provided by HCO3--\ntransport block implicates continued pathological activation of a HCO3--transporter in \nthe cells during OGD. The identity of the HCO3--transporter involved in this \nphenomenon may be unusual, since neither Na+ nor Cl- substitution was protective at \n60 min of OGD. One possibility is that a DIDS-sensitive, K-HCO-3 co-transporter is \npresent in developing white matter astrocytes, which would be consistent with the \nprotective effect at 60 min of removing extracellular K+ (simultaneous with Na+\nremoval). K-HCO3 cotransport has been identified in squid giant axons (Hogan et al. \n1995a; Hogan et al. 1995b), but this is the first indication of its presence in the CNS. \nAs with the NKCC and the other HCO3--transporters, stimulation of K-HCO3 co-\ntransport will produce cell swelling and potential cytotoxic injury, and the protective \neffect of combined Na+ and K+ substitution will follow the block of NKCC and Na+-\nand K+- dependent HCO3--transporters, explaining all of the data collected in the \ncurrent investigation. \nPage 18 of 48\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n19\nClasmatodendrosis \n In the current experiments, we found no condition under which the injury \nproduced by OGD in astrocyte processes occurred more rapidly than the parallel loss \nof astrocyte somata, indicating that \"clasmatodendrosis\", as defined as the loss of \nprocesses independently of the loss of somata, was not seen during OGD in the \ncurrent preparation. In this regard, it is worth noting that the only other modern study \nof clasmatodendrosis also observed somata death in parallel to process loss when \nexamined using cytoplasmic GFP-fluorescence (Hulse et al. 2001). As in this previous \nstudy, we did observe beading of GFP-filled astrocyte processes during OGD, \nindicating the temporary formation of membrane-bound fragments of disintegrating \nprocesses. It must be born in mind that we have recently shown that immature white \nmatter astrocytes are much more sensitive to ischemic conditions than are immature \ngrey matter astrocytes (both in whole mount preparations) (Shannon et al 2007). This \nmay indicate that the astrocytes studied in the current investigation suffer a more \nsevere form of injury than may occur in grey matter parts of the developing brain, and \nmay therefore be less likely to exhibit a selective loss of cell processes. At the \nultrastructural level we also found clear examples where processes were detaching \nfrom the soma, often associated with the presence of cytoplasmic vacuoles that may \nindicate local cell swelling. It would appear, therefore, that shedding of processes is a \nfeature of acute ischemic injury of astrocytes, but that the underlying injury \nmechanism is not selective for processes and proceeds in parallel with injury to the \nsomata.  \n We did observe a selective loss of astrocyte processes in the injuries produced \nby zero-Ca2+or zero-K+ conditions. The effect of K+-removal was Na+ and Cl-\nPage 19 of 48\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n20\ndependent, and we can speculate that the mechanism underlying this process loss may \ninvolve a localized form of cell swelling of unknown origin. Since volume regulation \nin astrocytes is partially dependent upon Ca2+(O'Connor and Kimelberg 1993), a \nsimilar phenomenon may also explain the effect of Ca2+-substitution. \n \nValidation of the GFP-imaging to Assess Cell Morphology Changes during OGD \n A variety of approaches can be used to assess cell morphology changes in the \nbrain during ischemic conditions. The most commonly used is immuno-\nhistochemistry at the light level. However, we have recently shown that astrocyte \nmarkers such as GFAP cannot be successfully applied to white matter preparations \nusing this technique due to the low level of staining of the somata (Shannon et al \n2007). A more accurate approach is to use quantitative electron miscopy, although \nthis can be laborious and does not allow the continuous assessment of cell shape with \ntime. Confocal GFP-fluorescence imaging, in contrast, allows a time series of \nmorphological changes to be collected in an objective manner. This approach has \nbeen used recently to assess changes in oligodendrocyte processes (Salter and Fern \n2005). However, the application of GFP-fluorescent imaging under ischemic \nconditions may require additional validation because ischemia evokes changes in the \nionic composition and pH of cells that may affect GFP-fluorescence. \n In the current study, quantitative electron microscopy was used to measure the \nnumber of astrocyte processes per cell and the length of the processes under several \nconditions. The quantitative electron microscopy and the GFP-fluorescent imaging \ndata correlated well, showing a similar degree of process loss after 60 min of OGD \ncompared to control perfusion and an intermediate effect of OGD in the absence of \nextracellular Na+. Furthermore, conditions that evoke larger pH changes in the optic \nPage 20 of 48\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n21\nnerve than OGD, such as anoxia in the presence of 20 mM glucose, failed to affect \nGFP-fluorescence of astrocyte processes. Mature grey matter astrocytes show a small \nintracellular pH change during short (20 min) periods of global ischemia in situ \n(Lascola and Kraig 1997), while whole mount P0-2 rodent optic nerve astrocytes \nshow only a ~0.2 acid pH change during 60 min of OGD (Garrido-Comas and Fern \n2004). Since the fluorescence of GFP is generally stable between pH 6-10, with the \nS65T mutant used here being only slightly more pH sensitive over this range \n(Patterson et al 1997), the evidence is strong that GFP-fluorescence of GFP-GFAP \nastrocytes in the current preparation is not significantly affected by pH changes during \nischemic conditions. \n \nConclusions \n The OGD-induced damage suffered by immature white matter astrocytes \nreported here may be relevant to the injuries most commonly associated with cerebral \npalsy. In many cases, these selective white matter lesions of the developing brain \nappear to be hypoxic-ischemic in origin (Back and Rivkees 2004; Volpe 1995). While \nastrocyte damage has not been well studied in histo-pathological studies, the \nsensitivity of these cells to ischemic-type injury together with the apparent loss of \nglutamate from them during ischemia (Back et al. 2006; Thomas et al. 2004), and the \nsignificance of extracellular glutamate to the injury process (Fern and Moller 2000; \nFollett et al. 2004; Follett et al. 2000; Salter and Fern 2005; Wilke et al. 2004), all \nsuggest that the early astrocyte changes reported here will have important \nconsequences clinically. The mechanisms of astrocyte injury involve over-activation \nof NKCC and DIDS-sensitive HCO3--transport, leading to ion influx and loss of cell \nintegrity as the cells swell.

Traystman, Ph.D. \nEditor-in-Chief \nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism \n \nDear Richard, \n \nPlease find attached an updated version of our manuscript \"The mechanisms of acute \nischemic injury in the cell processes of developing white matter astrocytes\" (JCBFM-\n0150-07-ORIG), which has been revised in accordance with the wishes of the reviewers. \nOur responses to the reviewers comments are detailed below, following each original \ncriticism (in bold). \n \nReferee: 1\nThe manuscript by Mike Salter and Robert Fern addresses the important question \nof how immature white matter astrocytes are affected by oxygen-glucose \ndeprivation (OGD), similar to the types of perinatal white matter injuries that occur \nin premature infants. Although there is extensive data addressing this question in \nthe context of olgodendrocyte progenitors and in neurons, and clear evidence of \nreactive astrogliosis in resulting white matter lesions, less is known about how \ndifferent populations of astrocytes survive under these conditions.   \n \nOverall, the paper is well-written and the study is well-done, utilizing transgenic \nmice that express green fluorescence protein (GFP) under the control of the human \nGFAP promoter to visualize astrocytes.  In addition to characterizing how OGD \ninfluences astrocytes, the authors provide several mechanistic insights that support \nthe conclusion that ischemic injury to immature white matter astrocytes involves a \ncytotoxic ion influx mediated, at least in part, by Na-K-Cl co-transport and Na-K-\ndependent HCO3 transport. \nWe thank the reviewer for his positive comments. \n \nThe only major concern is that the human GFAP promoter is active in GFAP-\npositive neurogenic progenitor cells.  Although this study focused on optic nerve, the \ndegree to which this promoter specifically labels astrocytes in this tissue is not \nentirely clear, and Palmer and co-workers have reported neurogenic progenitors in \noptic nerve (J. Neurosci. 1999; 19:8487). This should be addressed both in the text, \nhighlighting previous studies showing neuronal targeting by this promoter, and \nexperimentally using a series of markers to verify that the cells being counted in the \ntransgenic mice are indeed astrocytes, both in control sections and in sections \nsubjected to OGD.  In particular, do all of the GFP-positive cells express other \nastrocyte markers (e.g. GLAST, CD44) or do some also express markers of glial \nprogenitors (e.g. NG2) or oligodendrocyte progenitors (e.g. O4, PDGF-R-alpha, or \nPage 51 of 48\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\nolig2). Do any of the cells express early markers of neurons (e.g. HuC\/D)?  By \naddressing these questions, there would be a high level of confidence that some of \nthe differential effects reported in this manuscript are indeed on subpopulations of \nastrocytes and not other immature cell types. \n \nThe reviewer points out that Palmer et al (1999) demonstrated the presence of optic \nnerve cells that have the potential to develop into neuronal cells, and questions whether \nthe GFP-GFAP(+) cells that we have studied are therefore all astrocytes. Indeed, several \nrecent papers have described the role of immature GFAP(+) cells as neurogenic \nprogenitors. For example, GFAP-GFP(+) cells of the neonatal subventricular zone have \nbeen shown to have the potential to differentiate into neural stem cells (Raponi et al \n2007). Furthermore, cultures of GFAP(+) cells from P0-P2 brains are heterogeneous, \ncontaining a population of cells with neurogenic potential (Imura et al 2006). However, it \nmust be born in mind that neonatal subventricular zone GFP-GFAP(+) cells have many \nof the properties of mature astrocytes and behave functionally as astrocytes (Liu 2006). \nFurthermore, in somewhat more mature optic nerve GFAP-GFP expression is restricted \nto astrocytes identified on ultrastructural, electrophysiological, morphological and \nimmuno-labeling criteria (Nolte 2001), while in that the ages studied in the current paper \nall GFAP(+) astrocytes are post-mitotic (Skoff 1990). Consistent with this, Steiner et al \n2004 have reported that neurogenic hippocampal astrocytes become GFAP-GFP(-) prior \nto expression of the earliest neuronal  markers. This information is now summarized in \nthe manuscript as requested (pages 15-16).  \n To further probe this question, we have performed the range of immuno-stainings \nrequested by the reviewer (described on page 5, last para and the new Figure 1). This has \nshown that GFP-GFAP(+) cells of P10 optic nerve are positive for astrocyte markers such \nas CD44, GFAP and GLT-1, negative for oligodendroglial markers such as NG-2 and O4, \nand negative for neuronal markers such as neurofilament, Thy-1 and HuD. We did find \nthat some GFP-GFAP(+) cells were CD44(-), which is consistent with prior reports of \nonly weak staining of a sub-population of optic nerve astrocytes (Jones et al 2000). \nInterestingly, while all GFP-GFAP(+) astrocytes were HuD(-), we observed a large \npopulation of HuD(+) cells that appear to be oligodendroglia. This is consistent with prior \nreports of Hu(+) glia in rodent optic nerve (Kostyk et al 1996). While not strictly relevant \nto the current study, we have included this data in a new Figure 1 since the apparent \npresence of this early neuronal marker in oligodendroglial cells may be of interest to \nother workers. We did not attempt to immuno-stain post OGD optic nerves since \neffectively all of the GFP-GFAP(+) cells are dead at that point. \n \nA minor concern: more detail should be given, and perhaps additional examples, of \nthe changes in astrocyte processes shown in Fig. 2.  This would provide more \nconvincing support for the author\u2019s claims.  More details about how these results \nwere quantified would also be helpful.   \n \nAt the reviewers request, more detail has been added about the analysis of the \nmicrographs (bottom page 7) and we have included more micrographs that give \nadditional details of the ultrastructural features of astrocyte process detachment (new \nPage 52 of 48\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\nFigure 4). \n \nReferee : 2\nThe manuscript by Salter and Fern shows new and interesting bases for the \nmechanisms of astrocytic injury in immature white matter.  The authors exposed \nastrocytic cultures from GAP-GFP mice to oxygen glucose deprivation and show a \nparallel loss of cell processes and somata using confocal fluorescence microscopy \nfrom live optic nerves in situ as well as subsequent quantitative electron microscopy.  \nThey then performed a series of manipulations (including specific salt substitutions) \nto suggest that Na and K dependent bicarbonate transport plays a role in this \ncytotoxic injury of astrocytes. This is a well-written and carefully executed body of \nwork that describes new and useful information about astrocytic injury in immature \nwhite matter.  The experiments are reproducible and illustrated by an appropriate \narray of images. \nWe thank the reviewer for these positive comments. \n \nHowever, the distinction the authors wish to pursue \u2013 that of differential \nastrocytic membrane specialization (e.g., between somata and cell processes) is \nsomewhat overstated.   It is appropriate that this aspect of the work be phrased with \nmore caution.  For example, they cite literature illustrating clasmatodendrosis as \nevidence for differential injury (page 3, paragraph 1).  However, to this reviewer\u2019s \nknowledge this work shows that while processes change first (i.e., \nclasmatodendrosis) cell bodies change later that is \u201cprocesses disintegrate along \nwith their cell bodies \u201d (Hulse ref).  However, the presentation (page 3, paragraph 1, \nlast sentence) suggests that processes alone are lost.  This is not the case.  In fact, if \ninvolved membrane processes (in the latter example) were uniformly distributed \nacross astrocytic membranes, wouldn\u2019t it be expected that processes would change \nfirst and then cell bodies, if not other reason, than a volume distribution \nconsideration (i.e., less volume in processes than in cell bodies)?  \n Since gray matter astrocytes are more resistant to ischemic injury than white \nmatter (immature) astrocytes (page 4) couldn\u2019t the difference between the current \nwork and that previously reported simply be due to severity of injury?  For example \nwith more resistant gray matter astrocytes, the cells CAN show a spatially \ndifferential demise to ischemic injury but with more susceptible white matter \nimmature astrocytes, the same injury is more severe and so the cells show \nUNIFORM change.  This aspect of the Introduction and related concepts \nthroughout the manuscript (e.g., page 16, paragraph 2) need modification to reflect \nthese considerations. \nWe appreciate the reviewers insightful comments, and are convinced by the reviewer \narguments. We have therefore altered the text in accordance with the reviewers views. \nIndeed, we had not meant to give the impression in the introduction that astrocyte \nPage 53 of 48\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\nprocesses are necessarily differentially injured during ischemia, but rather that it is not \nknown how these structures are damaged under ischemic conditions. We have therefore \nchanged page 3 para 1 in light of this. We have also made the point about selective injury \nof white matter vs., gray matter astrocytes, with reference to any potential selective \nprocess loss (page 19, para 1). \n \nThe authors should briefly describe (page 6, paragraph 2) the criteria used to \nidentify astrocytes.  Same point for \u201cestablished criteria\u201d (page 8, paragraph 2, line \n5).   \n \nWe have now briefly summarized this information (page 7, para2). \n \nIt is not clear why the authors list the number of nerves used (page 7) and not \nthe number of cells (since the latter were used for measurements).  Did they register \none cell per nerve? \n \nThe quantitative assessment of process loss was made from regions of interest within \nnerves, as described on pages 6-7. These regions were drawn to exclude astrocyte somata \nand so we give the number of nerves rather than the number of somata. \nPage 54 of 48\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n"}
