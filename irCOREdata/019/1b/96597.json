Introduction and Examples. This article presents an alternative approach to\nthat part of complex analysis that deals with relating the real and imaginary parts\nof complex holomorphic functions to each other and to the underlying holomorphic\nfunction from which they are derived. If you have studied or are studying complex\nanalysis, you will have noted the following standard results. Let z = x + iy and\nf(z) = u(x, y)+ iv(x, y). If f(z) is differentiable at z = z0, then the Cauchy\u2013Riemann\nequations (C-R) hold at z0. The C-R are the pair of conditions\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n=\n\u2202v\n\u2202y\n,\n\u2202u\n\u2202y\n= \u2212\u2202v\n\u2202x\n(1.1)\nat z0. Conversely, if the C-R hold and furthermore u, v are both differentiable1 func-\ntions of two real variables at (x0, y0), where z0 = x0 + iy0, then f(z) is differentiable\n\u2217Received by the editors July 25, 2003; accepted for publication (in revised form) August 10,\n2004; published electronically October 29, 2004.\nhttp:\/\/www.siam.org\/journals\/sirev\/46-4\/43215.html\n\u2020OCIAM, The Mathematical Institute, 24-29 St. Giles, Oxford OX1 3LB, England (shaww@\nmaths.ox.ac.uk).\n1By this we do not just mean that u, v have first partial derivatives. Differentiability of u : R2 \u2212\u2192\nR is the stronger condition that in a neighborhood of (x0, y0), we can write u(x0 + h, y0 + k) =\nu(x0, y0) + h \u2202u\u2202x (x0, y0) + k\n\u2202u\n\u2202y\n(x0, y0) + R, |R|\/\n\u221a|h|2 + |k|2 \u2192 0 as (h, k) \u2192 (0, 0). In fact, it\nis sufficient that the first partial derivatives of u exist and are continuous in a neighborhood of\n(x0, y0) for u to be differentiable. But we shall not need to worry about such issues here, and the\ninterested reader may wish to consult section 9.10 of [5] for a detailed discussion of real multivariate\n717\n718 WILLIAM T. SHAW\nat z0. If such conditions hold for all z in an open subset U \u2208 C, we say that f\nis holomorphic on U . The terms analytic or regular are often used synonymously\nwith holomorphic. The writer of this article prefers to reserve the term \u201canalytic\u201d to\ncharacterize functions having a power series, and to only identify \u201cholomorphic\u201d and\n\u201canalytic\u201d once one has proved the theorems that show they are equivalent.\nGiven a function u(x, y), the question often arises as to how to find the corre-\nsponding v and hence f . In standard texts this is almost always presented as an\nexercise in solving the C-R. Note that a preliminary and very sensible step is to check\nthat u (or v if you start with that) satisfies the two-dimensional Laplace equation\n(this is implied by the C-R once you realize that you can differentiate infinitely often)\n(1.2)\n\u22022u\n\u2202x2\n+\n\u22022u\n\u2202y2\n= 0 .\nHere is an example often presented in a traditional development. Let u = x2 \u2212 y2.\nWe have, for v, by the C-R,\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n=\n\u2202v\n\u2202y\n= 2x ,\n\u2202u\n\u2202y\n= \u2212\u2202v\n\u2202x\n= \u22122y .\n(1.3)\nWe integrate each of these equations for v and obtain\nv = 2xy + g(x) ,\nv = 2yx+ h(y) ,\n(1.4)\nwhere g, h are arbitrary functions. We can conclude the matter by arguing that be-\ncause we have found the consistent contribution 2xy to v, equating both the candidate\nexpressions for v requires that both g and h must be constants, and so v = 2xy + c\nfor some real constant c, and hence that\n(1.5) f(z) = x2 \u2212 y2 + 2ixy + ic = (x+ iy)2 + ic = z2 + ic , c \u2208 R .\nTo summarize, you need to carry out the following steps:\n1. differentiate u;\n2. integrate the two partial differential equations for v;\n3. pick the functions of integration to get consistency;\n4. reorganize to identify f .\nTo get a feel for this, or to remind yourself how this works, it is a good idea to\ntry a few examples.\n1.1. Examples for You to Try. In more general cases the third step will be less\ntrivial than the example given, and the last step may require quite a bit of algebra\nand insight. If you have not done an example like this for some time, you should try\nout the following cases:\nu(x, y) = x3 \u2212 3xy2 ,\nu(x, y) = 4xy(y2 \u2212 x2) .\ndifferentiability. For further discussion of the interplay between real and complex differentiability,\nsee p. 35 of [3] and Chapter 10 of [6].\nEXTRACTING HOLOMORPHIC FUNCTIONS WITHOUT CAUCHY\u2013RIEMANN 719\nThese two are reasonably straightforward, but you might find these a little tougher:\nu(x, y) = exp\n(\nx\nx2 + y2\n)\ncos\n(\ny\nx2 + y2\n)\n,\nu(x, y) = (x2 + y2)\n1\n4 cos\n[\n1\n2\ntan\u22121\n(y\nx\n)]\n.\nThese examples soon convince you that it would be a good thing if there was an\nalternative route avoiding the four steps given above.\n1.2. The Existence of Another Approach. The solution of the C-R is not the\nonly route you can take, and this article sets out an alternative and purely algebraic\napproach. No claim for originality is made for the results presented here. Indeed, a\nsimplified form of the basic result (Theorem 2.1) appears, for example, as Exercise\n101 of Chapter 3 of the student text by Spiegel [7] and on pages 27\u201328 of Chapter\n2 of Ahlfors [2]. But the general theorem and its applications are conspicuous by\ntheir absence from mainstream student texts, and this article sets out not only to\nremedy this, but also to solicit information on the history of this approach. The\nauthor welcomes information on the background to these methods. Ahlfors provides\nan explanation of the basic result of Theorem 2.1, but appears to restrict attention\nto rational functions. He also states that \u201cthe method can be extended to the general\ncase and that a complete justification can be given.\u201d The present author is not aware\nof where this has been written down, if anywhere, and it is also not clear whether\nAhlfors considered the result based on points other than the origin. Another issue\nraised by Ahlfors is that it is necessary to extend the usual notion of u and v to be\ncomplex mappings C2 \u2212\u2192 C, and this is made explicit here. The author also wishes\nto make it clear that the result of Theorem 2.1 was written down by J. Ockendon in\nOxford, having been observed by him to be true based on power series considerations.\nHis challenge to this author2 was to explain why this result must hold and to find out\nwhat happens if f(0) does not exist. So this article is another one of those papers\nemerging from a math common room challenge!\n2. The Theorem Based at the Origin. In this section I present the base case\nof the theorem that allows a holomorphic function to be reconstructed algebraically\nfrom its real part. Throughout the development of the idea we shall use the notion\nof the reflection of a holomorphic function in the real axis. If f : C \u2212\u2192 C is given by\nf(z), then its reflection f\u02c6 : C \u2212\u2192 C is given by\n(2.1) f\u02c6(z) = f(z) .\nNote that if f is holomorphic on U \u2282 C, then f\u02c6 is a holomorphic function on the open\nset that is the reflection of U in the real axis.\nTheorem 2.1. Let f(z) be holomorphic in a neighborhood of the origin, with real\npart u(x, y) and imaginary part v(x, y), where z = x+ iy. Then\nf(z) = 2u\n(\nz\n2\n,\nz\n2i\n)\n\u2212 f(0)\n= 2iv\n(\nz\n2\n,\nz\n2i\n)\n+ f(0) .\n(2.2)\n2This challenge was delivered in late 2002.\n720 WILLIAM T. SHAW\nProof. Given f(z), let u\u02dc : C2 \u2212\u2192 C be given by\n(2.3) u\u02dc(w1, w2) =\n1\n2\n[\nf(w1 + iw2) + f\u02c6(w1 \u2212 iw2)\n]\n.\nNote that by setting\n(2.4) w1 =\nz\n2\n, w2 =\nz\n2i\n,\nwhere z is a complex number, we obtain\n(2.5) u\u02dc\n(\nz\n2\n,\nz\n2i\n)\n=\n1\n2\n[\nf(z) + f\u02c6(0)\n]\n=\n1\n2\n[\nf(z) + f(0)\n]\n.\nObserve that if w1 = x,w2 = y, where x, y \u2208 R, then\nu\u02dc(x, y) =\n1\n2\n[\nf(x+ iy) + f\u02c6(x\u2212 iy)]\n=\n1\n2\n[\nf(x+ iy) + f(x+ iy)\n]\n= u(x, y) ,\n(2.6)\nso that u\u02dc is the natural extension to C2 of the real function u(x, y). Here, by the\nnatural extension of a real function u : R2 \u2212\u2192 R we mean the function uex : C2 \u2212\u2192 C\nyou get by plugging into u the complex variable w1 wherever you see an x and the\ncomplex variable w2 wherever you see a y. This uex, evaluated at ( z2 ,\nz\n2i ), is what we\nmeant when we wrote u( z2 ,\nz\n2i ) in (2.2) in the statement of Theorem 2.1.\nWe showed above that u\u02dc and u agree when the inputs x, y are real. So u\u02dc and u have\nthe same natural extension to C2. Moreover, this extension is exactly u\u02dc : C2 \u2212\u2192 C.\nSo\n(2.7) u\n(\nz\n2\n,\nz\n2i\n)\n= uex\n(\nz\n2\n,\nz\n2i\n)\n= u\u02dc\n(\nz\n2\n,\nz\n2i\n)\n=\n1\n2\n[\nf(z) + f(0)\n]\n.\nA slight rearrangement yields the first line of (2.2) as required. The result for the\nimaginary part follows by defining\n(2.8) v\u02dc(w1, w2) =\n1\n2i\n[\nf(w1 + iw2)\u2212 f\u02c6(w1 \u2212 iw2)\n]\nand making similar observations.\n2.1. Comments on the Complexification of the Real and Imaginary Parts.\nYou have seen the introduction of functions u\u02dc, v\u02dc that extend u, v from being real\nmappings to complex mappings. What\u2019s going on here? Are there any other senses\nin which these functions are natural extensions of u, v to the complex? First, note\nthat these functions are naturally holomorphic as mappings from C2 to C, though a\nformal definition of what this means is not given here.3 Second, you should also note\n(and indeed check for yourself) that\n(2.9)\n\u22022u\u02dc\n\u2202w21\n+\n\u22022u\u02dc\n\u2202w22\n= 0 =\n\u22022v\u02dc\n\u2202w21\n+\n\u22022v\u02dc\n\u2202w22\n3In fact, if you take the definition of differentiability R2 \u2212\u2192 R given by the footnote to the intro-\nduction and replace all real objects by complex objects, you get the right notion of differentiability\nfor u\u02dc : C2 \u2212\u2192 C.\nEXTRACTING HOLOMORPHIC FUNCTIONS WITHOUT CAUCHY\u2013RIEMANN 721\nso that the complex functions satisfy the complex Laplace equation in the same way\nthat the real functions satisfy the real Laplace equation. Finally, as you have already\nseen, the complex functions with real arguments agree with the real ones when those\nsame arguments are used. So these mappings are indeed quite natural.\n2.2. Examples. In the following you will see some examples of how these tech-\nniques work. You should try the further examples listed at the end for yourself.\n2.2.1. Example 1. Here is a very simple case. We take u(x, y) = x2 \u2212 y2. You\nalready know what this will turn out to be! Note that u(0, 0) = 0, so that f(0) = i\u03b2\nfor some real \u03b2. The theorem says that\nf(z) = 2\n((z\n2\n)2\n\u2212\n( z\n2i\n)2)\n\u2212 f(0)\n= 2\n(\nz2\n4\n+\nz2\n4\n)\n\u2212 (i\u03b2)\n= z2 + i\u03b2 .\n(2.10)\n2.2.2. Example 2. Let\u2019s try another polynomial: u(x, y) = 4xy(y2 \u2212 x2). As in\nthe previous example, we can assert that f(0) = i\u03b2 for some real \u03b2. The theorem\nsays that\nf(z) = 2\u00d7 4\u00d7 z\n2\nz\n2i\n(( z\n2i\n)2\n\u2212\n(z\n2\n)2)\n\u2212 f(0)\n= 8\nz4\n16i\n(\u22122) + i\u03b2\n= i(z4 + \u03b2) .\n(2.11)\n2.2.3. Example 3. Now consider the case u(x, y) = exp(x) cos(y). Clearly u(0, 0)\n= 1 so we can assert that f(0) = 1 + i\u03b2 with \u03b2 real. In what follows it helps to\nremember that for any complex number p,\n(2.12) cos p =\n1\n2\n(exp(ip) + exp(\u2212ip)) .\nThen\nf(z) = 2 exp\n(z\n2\n)\ncos\n( z\n2i\n)\n\u2212 (1 + i\u03b2)\n= exp\n(z\n2\n) [\nexp\n(\ni\nz\n2i\n)\n+ exp\n(\n\u2212i z\n2i\n)]\n\u2212 1 + i\u03b2\n= exp\n(z\n2\n) [\nexp\n(z\n2\n)\n+ exp\n(\n\u2212z\n2\n)]\n\u2212 1 + i\u03b2\n= exp(z) + i\u03b2 .\n(2.13)\n2.2.4. Examples for You to Try. Try out the following\u2014you will find it easier\nif you make good use of the expression of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions in\nterms of exponentials:\n1. u(x, y) = y3 \u2212 3x2y.\n2. u(x, y) = exp(x) sin(y).\n3. v(x, y) = cosh(x) cos(y).\n722 WILLIAM T. SHAW\n3. The Theorem Based on a General Point. The result presented above is all\nvery fine, but what are you to do when f(0) does not exist? A related question would\nbe what should you do when confronted with a function like\n(3.1) u(x, y) =\nx\nx2 + y2\n,\nwhere the denominator would vanish if you made the replacements x \u2192 z2 , y \u2192 z2i?\nThis u is just the real part of 1\/z, so clearly you want to have a more useful and more\ngeneral theorem to cope with such a basic case.\nTheorem 3.1. Let f(z) be holomorphic in a neighborhood of the point a. As\nbefore, f has real part u(x, y) and imaginary part v(x, y), where z = x+ iy. Then\nf(z) = 2u\n(\nz + a\n2\n,\nz \u2212 a\n2i\n)\n\u2212 f(a)\n= 2iv\n(\nz + a\n2\n,\nz \u2212 a\n2i\n)\n+ f(a) .\n(3.2)\nProof. The details are given this time for the imaginary part. Given f(z), let\nv\u02dc : C2 \u2212\u2192 C be given, as before, by\n(3.3) v\u02dc(w1, w2) =\n1\n2i\n[\nf(w1 + iw2)\u2212 f\u02c6(w1 \u2212 iw2)\n]\n.\nObserve that if w1 = x,w2 = y, where x, y \u2208 R,\nv\u02dc(x, y) =\n1\n2i\n[\nf(x+ iy)\u2212 f\u02c6(x\u2212 iy)]\n=\n1\n2i\n[\nf(x+ iy)\u2212 f(x+ iy)]\n= v(x, y) .\n(3.4)\nWe merely need to modify our previous proof by picking w1, w2 so that\nz = w1 + iw2 ,\na = w1 \u2212 iw2 ,\n(3.5)\nwith solution\nw1 =\nz + a\n2\n,\nw2 =\nz \u2212 a\n2i\n.\n(3.6)\nSubstitution then supplies the result\n(3.7) 2iv\u02dc\n(\nz + a\n2\n,\nz \u2212 a\n2i\n)\n= f(z)\u2212 f(a)\nas required. The result for u follows by obvious similar manipulations.\nNote that the proof and indeed the application of this theorem involve the re-\nplacement of x and y by the complex variables in (3.6). In what follows we shall refer\nrepeatedly to the replacement rules for a general base point. The replacement rules\nare just the substitutions\n(3.8) x \u2212\u2192 z + a\n2\n, y \u2212\u2192 z \u2212 a\n2i\n.\nEXTRACTING HOLOMORPHIC FUNCTIONS WITHOUT CAUCHY\u2013RIEMANN 723\n3.1. Examples with a General Base Point. We are now in a position to explore\nthe extraction of the underlying holomorphic function for much more general situa-\ntions. Some examples are given here for you to follow; then some examples for you\nto work through are provided. Many of the examples involve a function u containing\nthe combination x2 + y2 somewhere in its formula. It is helpful to note that under\nthe replacement rules defined by Theorem 3.1,\n(3.9) x2 + y2 \u2212\u2192\n(\nz + a\n2\n)2\n+\n(\nz \u2212 a\n2i\n)2\n= za .\nIn the following examples we shall see how the use of a general base point and The-\norem 3.1 allows the extension of Theorem 2.1 to treat functions with poles, essential\nsingularities, or branch points at the origin.\n3.1.1.

Consider the\nfunction\n(3.10) u(x, y) =\nx\nx2 + y2\n.\nUsing the replacement rules, we can assert that\n(3.11) f(z) = 2\nz + a\n2\n1\nza\n\u2212 f(a) = 1\nz\n+\n1\na\n\u2212 f(a) .\nInspection of this relation at z = a implies that the real part of f(a) is the real part\nof 1a , so we deduce that\n(3.12) f(z) =\n1\nz\n+ i\u03b2 , \u03b2 \u2208 R .\n3.1.2. Example of a Function with an Essential Singularity at the Origin. We\nrecall the first of the functions given as a difficult one in subsection 1.1, given by\n(3.13) u(x, y) = exp\n(\nx\nx2 + y2\n)\ncos\n(\ny\nx2 + y2\n)\n.\nBy the replacement rules, the corresponding holomorphic function is given by\nf(z) = 2 exp\n(\nz + a\n2za\n)\ncos\n(\nz \u2212 a\n2iza\n)\n\u2212 f(a)\n= 2 exp\n(\n1\n2a\n+\n1\n2z\n)\ncos\n(\n1\n2ia\n\u2212 1\n2iz\n)\n\u2212 f(a) .\n(3.14)\nUsing the expression for the cosine function in terms of exponential functions, this\nsimplifies to\nf(z) = exp\n(\n1\nz\n)\n+ exp\n(\n1\na\n)\n\u2212 f(a)\n= exp\n(\n1\nz\n)\n+ i\u03b2 , \u03b2 \u2208 R .\n(3.15)\n724 WILLIAM T. SHAW\n3.1.3. Example of a Function with a Branch Point at the Origin. Consider the\nfunction\n(3.16) u(x, y) = log(\n\u221a\nx2 + y2) =\n1\n2\nlog(x2 + y2) .\nThis is now very straightforward. Using the replacement rules, this becomes\nf(z) = 2\n1\n2\nlog(za)\u2212 f(a) = log(z) + log(a)\u2212 f(a)\n= log(z) + i\u03b2 , \u03b2 \u2208 R .\n(3.17)\n3.2. Examples for You to Try. Here are some further examples of functions with\npoles, essential singularities, or branch points at the origin. In the examples involving\nthe inverse tangent function, the algebra will be easier if you use the logarithmic form\nof the arctangent function tan\u22121, given by\np = tan(q)\u21d0\u21d2 q = 1\n2i\nlog\n(\n1 + ip\n1\u2212 ip\n)\n.\n3.2.1. Example 1.\nu(x, y) =\nx2 \u2212 y2\n(x2 + y2)2\n.\n3.2.2. Example 2.\nu(x, y) =\nx3 \u2212 3xy2\n(x2 + y2)3\n.\n3.2.3. Example 3.\nu(x, y) = exp\n(\nx2 \u2212 y2\n(x2 + y2)2\n)\ncos\n(\n2xy\n(x2 + y2)2\n)\n.\n3.2.4. Example 4.\nu(x, y) = (x2 + y2)\n1\n4 cos\n[\n1\n2\ntan\u22121\n(y\nx\n)]\n.\n3.2.5. Example 5.\nu(x, y) = (x2 + y2)\n1\n2n cos\n[\n1\nn\ntan\u22121\n(y\nx\n)]\n, n \u2208 Z .\n4. The Modulus-Argument Variation. Suppose that instead of decomposing\nf(z) into its real and imaginary parts you write it in modulus-argument form:\n(4.1) f = R(x, y) exp(i\u0398(x, y)) .\nNote that while extracting \u0398 from f is subject to the usual ambiguity of an integer\nmultiple of 2\u03c0, if instead \u0398 is prescribed as a suitably smooth function, there is no\ndifficulty with the reverse process. You can apply Theorem 3.1 to\n(4.2) g = log f = logR+ i\u0398 ,\nEXTRACTING HOLOMORPHIC FUNCTIONS WITHOUT CAUCHY\u2013RIEMANN 725\nand it is a simple matter to deduce that\nf(z) = f(a) exp\n[\n2i\u0398\n(\nz + a\n2\n,\nz \u2212 a\n2i\n)]\n=\n1\nf(a)\nR2\n(\nz + a\n2\n,\nz \u2212 a\n2i\n)\n.\n(4.3)\nIn addition to working through the derivation of these identities, you should also check\nthrough the following examples for yourself.\n4.0.1. An Example Where the Modulus Is Specified. Show that\nR(x, y) = (x2 + y2)\n3\n2 \u21d2 f(z) = z3 exp(i\u03b1) , \u03b1 \u2208 R .\n4.0.2. An Example Where the Argument Is Specified. Show that\n\u0398(x, y) = y \u21d2 f(z) = \u03b1 exp(z) , \u03b1 \u2208 R .\nYou might like to try out some other examples.\n5. A Novel Use of Poisson\u2019s Formula for a Half-plane. A full appreciation of\nthis section and working out the examples requires some understanding of contour\nintegration.\nSo far we have assumed that somehow we can start with an explicit \u201cworked out\u201d\nformula for u, v, R, or \u0398. This is not in fact necessary, and we can make use of other\nrepresentations. An important case is given by Poisson\u2019s formula for a half-plane. If\nu is a solution of Laplace\u2019s equation (1.2) in the set {(x, y)|x, y \u2208 R, y > 0} such that\nu(x, y)\u2192 0 as\n\u221a\nx2 + y2 \u2192\u221e, and u(x, 0) is specified, then Poisson\u2019s formula states\nthat\n(5.1) u(x, y) =\n1\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ny u(s, 0)\n(x\u2212 s)2 + y2 ds .\nIf you have not met this formula before, you should note that if you want to check that\nthis formula recovers the value of u when y = 0, you must take the limit y \u2192 0 after\nworking out the integral. This formula can be established in at least three different\nways:\n1. by the use of Green\u2019s function methods within potential theory [4];\n2. by the use of transform techniques (see, e.g., [1]);\n3. as an application of the Cauchy integral formula to a half-plane (see, e.g.,\n[1, 6, 7]).\nThe holomorphic extraction Theorem 3.1 allows a different view to be taken of the\nPoisson formula. If we take the Poisson formula as given to us from real potential\ntheory, we can show that it implies the Cauchy integral formula for a half-plane in a\nvery direct way. If we apply Theorem 3.1 to (5.1), we deduce, after some elementary\nsimplification, that\n(5.2) f(z) = \u2212 i\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n(z \u2212 a)u(s, 0)ds\n(s\u2212 z)(s\u2212 a) \u2212 f(a) .\nThis can be simplified further by expanding the integrand into partial fractions. You\nshould check that this means you can write\n(5.3) f(z) = h(z)\u2212 h(a)\u2212 f(a) ,\n726 WILLIAM T. SHAW\nwhere\n(5.4) h(z) = \u2212 i\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nu(s, 0)ds\n(s\u2212 z) .\nFor our purposes, rather than analyzing this representation further, it is more useful\nto take the route of letting the base point a tend to infinity, and simply choose\nthe imaginary constant in f to be such that f \u2192 0 at infinity. Then we can see\nimmediately that\n(5.5) f(z) = h(z) = \u2212 i\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nu(s, 0)ds\n(s\u2212 z) .\nThis is of course a stronger result than the Cauchy integral formula applied to the\nupper half-plane, since only the real part is used along the straight part of the bound-\nary. This result can be used as is, to find the f(z) that is holomorphic in the upper\nhalf-plane with a given real part along the x-axis, or to provide a quick derivation of\nthe Hilbert transform. The following two examples, which require some expertise in\ncontour integration, should make this clear.\n5.0.1. An Example of Calculating f . Let\nu(s, 0) =\n1\ns2 + b2\n, b \u2208 R , b > 0 .\nShow that the function of z holomorphic in the upper half-plane with this real part\non y = 0 is\nf(z) =\ni\nb(z + ib)\n.\n5.0.2. The Hilbert Transform. By letting z = t+ i\u001e, where \u001e\u2192 0+, deduce the\nHilbert transform\u2014that the imaginary part of f along the y = 0 axis is given in terms\nof the real part by\nv(t, 0) = \u2212 1\n\u03c0\nPV\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nu(s, 0)ds\ns\u2212 t .\nHere the principal value (PV ) of the integral is interpreted as truncating the integral\nsymmetrically about the singular point:\nPV\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n= lim\n\u0006\u21920+\n\u222b t\u2212\u0006\n\u2212\u221e\n+\n\u222b \u221e\nt+\u0006\n.\n5.1. Some Interesting Further Topics to Explore. In the Poisson half-plane\nformula discussed here, attention is restricted to where u is specified along the entire\nreal axis, and attention is further restricted to where u and f are to be found in the\nupper half-plane only. If you look at the lower half-plane at the same time, matters\nbecome even more interesting. You might like to explore the use of the Poisson formula\nfor the lower half-plane, and then the more general set of problems known as Riemann\u2013\nHilbert problems. A brief introduction to this is given in Chapter 5, particularly\nsection 5.9.2, of [4]. If instead you allow, for example, u to be specified on part of\nthe real line (e.g., x > 0) and you specify, e.g., \u2202u\/\u2202y or v along a complementary\nEXTRACTING HOLOMORPHIC FUNCTIONS WITHOUT CAUCHY\u2013RIEMANN 727\nregion (e.g., x < 0), you are taken into an area of complex variable theory known as\nthe Wiener\u2013Hopf method. This is a powerful and practical method for solving mixed\nboundary value problems. An introduction to this is given in section 5.9.4 of [4]. An\nexcellent and extensive discussion of all these matters is given in Chapter 7 of the\ntext by Ablowitz and Fokas [1].\n6. Development of Automatic Symbolic Computation Routines. Given the\npurely algebraic nature of the extraction procedure, it is a straightforward matter\nto persuade a computer algebra system to carry out the calculation for you. In this\nsection I give some examples usingMathematica [8]. If you have this particular system,\nyou might like to explore the use of these routines (and e-mail the author if you find\nexamples where they break down!). If you have another system, you may find it useful\nto transfer these examples to your system. Either way, you should note the use of\nthe Mathematica function FullSimplify in dealing with more difficult examples (it\nis not needed on simple cases, but it is on some examples, such as the square root\ncase).\nThe extraction functions may also be regarded as the inverse of operations to take\nthe real or imaginary part of the function. These exist in Mathematica as the func-\ntions ComplexExpand[Re[expression]], ComplexExpand[Im[expression]], where\nthe target functions for ComplexExpand have been set so as to \u201cwork out the formu-\nlae\u201d in as much detail as possible\u2014i.e., it is not allowed to leave functions like Arg in\nthe output. You will need to consider this if operating in another computer algebra\nsystem. Note that a Mathematica notebook, containing the code discussed in this sec-\ntion and several examples, is available on the Internet at http:\/\/www.maths.ox.ac.uk\/\n\u223cshaww\/SIAMcr.nb. Other applications ofMathematica to complex analysis are given\nin [6]. Now we define theMathematica function that extracts the holomorphic function\nfrom its real part:\nRealToHolo[expr , anum , {xsym , ysym , zsym }] := Module[\n{abar = Conjugate[anum]}, func= 2*expr \/. {xsym \u2192 (zsym+abar)\/2, ysym\n\u2192 (zsym-abar)\/(2*I)};\nbasecorr = - expr\/.{xsym \u2192 Re[anum], ysym \u2192 Im[anum]};\nFullSimplify[func+basecorr+i*\u03b2 ]]\nWe can test the operation of RealToHolo on a list of functions all at once. First\nwe define a list of interesting functions:\nTestUSet = {x\u22272 - y\u22272, 4 x y(y\u22272 - x\u22272), Exp[x] Cos[y],\nExp[x\/(x\u22272 + y\u22272)] Cos[y\/(x\u22272 + y\u22272)], 1\/2 Log[x\u22272 + y\u22272],\n(x\u22272 + y\u22272)\u2227(1\/4) Cos[1\/2 ArcTan[x, y]]};\nThen we Map our function onto this list using a base point a = 1 throughout:\nMap[RealToHolo[#, 1, x, y, z] &, TestUSet]\n{\nz2 + i\u03b2, i(z4 + \u03b2 \u2212 1), i\u03b2 + ez, i\u03b2 + e 1z , i\u03b2 + log(z), i\u03b2 +\u221az\n}\nThe output demonstrates the reliability of the method and its ease of implementation.\n6.1. Inversion of theMathematica ComplexExpand function. Mathematica con-\ntains a function ComplexExpand that is a good companion to the holomorphic extrac-\ntion routines. The ComplexExpand function offers a neat way of finding the u or v\n728 WILLIAM T. SHAW\nfunction given the holomorphic function f . To apply it, we need to get this function\nto work everything out as much as possible, and not leave functions such as Arg, for\nthe argument, within the formula. This is accomplished by an option setting:\nSetOptions[ComplexExpand, TargetFunctions -> Re, Im];\nNow one example will suffice:\nComplexExpand[Re[Exp[1\/(x+I*y)]]]\ne\nx\nx2+y2 cos\n(\ny\nx2 + y2\n)\nRealToHolo[%, 1, x, y, z]\ni\u03b2 + e\n1\nz\nYou should try the other examples in this article to see how RealToHolo[] acts as a\nnatural inverse to ComplexExpand[Re[]]. Other examples and ImToHolo are given\nin the notebook available over the Internet.\nAcknowledgments.
