The paper goes on to identify the \ncharacteristics associated with a lack of transfer and suggests a tentative model of perceived influences on transfer of \nlearning. Based on this research, it is concluded that it is important to take programme learning design into account \nwhen considering support for transfer of learning from management development programmes back to the workplace. \nArticle Type: Research paper \nKeyword(s): Management development; Learning processes; Facilitators.  \n \n \n \n \nLeadership and management development are perceived as key issues for corporate life as evidenced by surveys of \nsenior executives (Watson Wyatt, 2000; CIMA, 2000) and research conducted on US and UK firms (Mabey and \nMartin, 2001). Group HR Directors in global corporations identified the capability for developing managers as a \nsignificant competitive advantage and argued that corporations need to become more sophisticated in their use of in \nhouse and business school training programmes (James and Burgoyne, 2001). \nTo develop effective international cadres of leaders and managers, organisations can choose from a variety of \neducational and developmental routes, including corporate universities and independent business schools. But, \nwhatever the route, supporting transfer and continuing learning is vital to making the best use of investment, \nparticularly in off line activity and development. The importance of having a development strategy, of learning design \nand the integration of development activity with business aims is recognised (Conger, 1993). Although new \ndevelopment designs incorporate action learning and link learning to real work challenges very closely, management \ndevelopment programmes still form a substantial part of organisations\u2019 development portfolios. It has been argued that \nthis is necessary to give people time away from the work place, for example at university campuses, to challenge \nparadigms, reflect and acquire cutting edge thinking (Fulmer, 1997). For these events there is a need to attend to the \nprocess of transferring learning from formal programmes back to the workplace. However, what is often offered is a \nsupport process that does not take the nature of the programme design into account (Burgoyne and Stuart, 1976). \nNor do support processes relate to the specific barriers and facilitators to transferring learning from a programme to the \nworkplace. This is becoming particularly important since many businesses are moving to short programmes, on \ndifferent topics, at many points during a manager's career, requiring multiple points for transfer of learning (Belling, \n2001). \nThis paper looks at how organisations can become more sophisticated at supporting the transfer of learning, by \nidentifying barriers and facilitators and relating these to the type of programme managers\u2019 experience. Our research \nenables the development of a tentative model that enables such a tailored process to be developed. First, the relevant \nknowledge and theory about management learning, development and transfer is considered, then a longitudinal study \nis described, which identifies managers\u2019 perceived barriers and facilitators to transferring their learning from \nmanagement development programmes. The major findings of this study are highlighted and, based on this research, \na model is presented for improving learning transfer. \n \n \nTransfer of managerial learning from formal management development programmes \nManagement development involves purposive activities, designed to transform, \u201c\u2026 and, as with all transformations, \nthere is a core process involved\u201d (Burgoyne and Stuart, 1976, p. 5). This suggests that the learning outcomes, \nintended or otherwise, which are the source of transfer material, must be set in the context of the core learning \nprocesses which produced them (Burgoyne and Stuart, 1976; Knowles et al., 1998). These are messy and often \nconfusing aspects of management development, but crucial to take into account when considering what managers \nlearn and apply back in their workplace and what organisations can do to support this learning (Rouillier and \nGoldstein, 1991). \nTannenbaum and Yukl (1992, p. 240) define transfer as \u201c\u2026 the extent to which trainees effectively apply the \nknowledge, skills and attitudes gained in a training context back to the job\u201d. Most definitions of transfer portray a \nprocess whereby prior learning, such as that from a learning event or experience, affects new learning or performance \n(Marini and Genereux, 1995). Though transfer is not referred to explicitly as having outcomes, this is implied in the \nnotion that transfer can only be detected through generalisation of learning to the job context, over and for an \nunspecified period of time (Baldwin and Ford, 1988). \nViews of the feasibility of transferring learning, range from the pessimistic in which little or no learning is seen to be \napplied (Tannenbaum and Yukl, 1992; Haskell, 2001), to the more positive. These views acknowledge that transfer is \nnot easy, but that by identifying the kinds of things that help and hinder the application of managers\u2019 learning, obstacles \ncan be tackled and by implication, helping factors can be maximised (Broad and Newstrom, 1992). \nResearchers have identified seven hindering aspects to transfer of learning. These are lack of peer support \n(Newstrom, 1986; Tannenbaum and Yukl, 1992); lack of reinforcement back on the job, time and work pressures, \nlack of authority, perceived irrelevance of the programme (Newstrom, 1986); lack of support from the organisation \n(Newstrom, 1986; Holton, 1997) and group resistance to training (Patching and Higginbotham, 1994; Hastings et \nal., 1995; Holton, 1997). Similarly, four support factors have been identified: job\/role aids, reward (Tannenbaum and \nYukl, 1992); support, particularly from supervisors and peers (Tannenbaum and Yukl, 1992; Holton, 1997) and \nopportunity to use learning (Holton, 1997). However, these barriers and facilitators have not been studied together and \nthere has been an implicit assumption in much of the research, that these are all the barriers and support elements that\nexist, and\/or that they are the most significant. \nAnother important facet in looking at transfer, is that there are a range of potential influences on individuals\u2019 \nexperiences of transfer, which broadly fall into three groups: characteristics of the individual learner; aspects of their \nworkplace and facets of the learning experience itself (Tannenbaum and Yukl, 1992; Russ-Eft, 2002). Operationally, \nit must be assumed that everyone requires the same form of support, in all circumstances, unless it is possible to \ndiscriminate the effects of these factors: Who is most affected by particular barriers and facilitators? (Williams and \nLillibridge, 1992) Which aspects of the workplace environment impact on managers\u2019 perceptions of applying their \nlearning within different contexts? (Brown and Duguid, 1991; Denison, 1996) What kind of learning processes, \noutcomes and applications are involved? (Knowles, 1998; Argyris, 1999). Clearly, support cannot be targeted \neffectively, if it is not known who most needs help, and, what that help should be. \nA range of individual characteristics which may be involved in influencing transfer, particularly in relation to managers, \nmay be roughly grouped into: biographical elements and psychological elements, (Kanfer, 1990), personality (Krahe, \n1992) and organisational elements, such as managerial experience and job satisfaction (Noe, 1986). So too, a range \nof workplace features have been researched for their impact on the transfer of learning, most notably social support \n(Huczynski and Lewis, 1980), particularly from peers (Facteau, 1995). To date there has been little data on what \nmanagers perceive as helping or hindering them in transferring their learning and how those perceptions differ, \ndepending on the kind of learning experience\/type of programme they have attended. These relationships were \nincorporated into the design of the research presented here. \n \n \nA framework for typing management development programmes \nTannenbaum and Yukl's (1992) definition of transfer of learning, together with the identification of a limited range of \nbarriers and facilitators and some indication of the relevant individual and workplace characteristics which could \ninfluence transfer, provided the start point for the study. Learning processes were considered by reference to a \nframework first described by Corder (1990) and adapted to suit management training and development by Snell and \nJames (1994). This framework is built on two dimensions, resulting in a two-by-two matrix. First, is the programme \ntangible or intangible in its orientation to the subject matter or content? A \u201ctangible\u201d learning orientation is based on the \nassumption that managerial roles are themselves tangible, with managers focused on attaining clear, practical results, \nwhich are quantifiable and can be assessed. Teaching and learning processes used to support the \u201ctangible\u201d \norientation, draw on expert knowledge and tools from a variety of functional specialisms, such as law, economics and \nhuman resource management. An \u201cintangible\u201d learning orientation, however, views learning as a complex business of \nsecondary socialisation, where personal and situation specific know-how \u201c\u2026 cannot be meaningfully distilled \u2026 for \nmass consumption \u2026\u201d (Snell and James, 1994, p. 321). Instead, ideas and insights from a wide range of disciplines \nare offered to managers as examples or catalysts for thought (Burgoyne, 1994). \nThe second dimension concerns whether the teaching approach, in terms of intended aims and learning processes \nused, is \u201chard\u201d or \u201csoft\u201d. The \u201chard\u201d approach focuses on what to think and leads to \u201canswers\u201d which are dependent on \nthe subject. the \u201csoft\u201d approach focuses on how to think and leads to questions that are dependent on the environment \nor the person. The resulting quadrants describe a combination of learning orientations and teaching aims, descriptive \nof the range of most management development programmes. \nHard\/tangible programmes are designed with the intention that managers can acquire specific knowledge and master \nparticular analytical tools and techniques, which they can then apply. Soft\/tangible programmes are more concerned \nwith raising awareness by providing a basic appreciation and understanding of issues, often through sophisticated \nexperimental and simulated operating environments. Hard\/intangible programmes translate ideas and information into \nguidelines, examples of best practice or map competing theoretical perspectives, while soft\/intangible programmes are \ndesigned to help managers learn to think for and develop themselves through reflexive enquiry, where the sharing and \ncollective sense-making of personal experiences is encouraged. Any subject or combinations of subjects relevant to \nmanagement performance, such as strategy, leadership or change management, could be mapped onto this \nframework, and the resulting programme would be very different in each of the quadrants. \n \n \nResearch study \nThis research addresses three key questions. What are the barriers and facilitators to the transfer of learning? Do \nthese barriers and facilitators differ depending on the nature of the learning processes and content used in \nmanagement development programmes? Do these barriers and facilitators differ depending on the individual \ncharacteristics of those experiencing a programme and\/or features of the workplace to which they return? These are \nimportant questions, if management development specialists are to become more sophisticated in supporting learning \ntransfer. \nThis research takes a realist perspective (Harr\u00e9, 1970, 1995; Outhwaite, 1987), which is suited to exploratory studies. \nEmphasis is on building a model of influences on transfer of learning by focusing on individual managers\u2019 experiences \nand identifying patterns of meaning within those experiences. One methodology capable of enabling this search for \nessentially unobservable \u201creason explanations\u201d (Harr\u00e9, 1995) is survey methodology (Moser and Kalton, 1971). This \nenabled a large amount of data to be collected over an 18-month period, from managers attending management \ndevelopment programmes of different lengths (from one week to almost a year), from different organisations and at \ndifferent points in their learning and transfer experiences. \nThis longitudinal survey comprised questionnaires, plus face-to-face, in-depth, semi-structured interviews (Miles and \nHubermann, 1994). \n \n \nData collection  \nData were collected at three points in time: before the manager's programme, immediately after and at a follow-up \nstage three to six months after their programme. Questionnaires were administered at each of these points to over 200 \nmanagers from 17 different organisations participating in public and tailored management development programmes, \ndesigned and delivered either by the organisation itself for its own managers, or by lecturers and management \ndevelopment consultants at a major business school. Sixteen participants were interviewed shortly after completing \ntheir follow-up questionnaire. \nInformation to be gathered by questionnaire was identified from a literature review and comprised four overall areas \nshown to affect transfer of learning: individual characteristics, features of the workplace environment to which \nmanagers returned after a programme or learning experience, learning from the programme and transfer experiences \n(including perceived barriers and facilitators). Table I shows the individual characteristics and workplace features \nincluded. Selection depended on demonstration of significant associations with transfer identified during the literature \nsearch. Survey questions or items that had been used in these earlier studies were incorporated into the \nquestionnaires\u2019 design, where appropriate. Where no such material existed, particularly in relation to learning \noutcomes and transfer experiences, specific open questions were created. \nInformation about each manager and their work environment, plus qualitative information in the form of open questions \nabout each manager's expectations of the programme and their working relationships was gathered immediately \nbefore each programme, by postal questionnaire. \nImmediately after the programme, participants completed a second questionnaire, describing their key learning points \nfrom their programme and what they needed to do to apply their learning. This questionnaire also asked them how \nstrongly they agreed or disagreed with a set of 25 potential barriers and 17 facilitators in terms of the likelihood of each \naffecting their attempts to transfer learning back to their workplace. This set of items was based on the seven barrier \nelements and four support elements identified by Newstrom (1986), Tannenbaum and Yukl (1992), Patching and \nHigginbotham (1994), Hastings et al. (1995) and Holton (1997), together with further items based on the \nresearcher's own experience of evaluating management development programmes. Respondents were also given the \nopportunity to describe barriers or facilitators that were not included within this list. \nA third questionnaire was then forwarded to participants. Evaluation research gives little clue as to the most \nappropriate timing for gathering data once participants have left a programme. This third postal questionnaire was \ncompleted between three months later (for programmes of one week and three months duration, where tools and \nframeworks were anticipated to be applied) and six months later (for programmes of over three months duration, \nparticularly those focused on self-development and requiring reflection time before transfer could be expected). This \nquestionnaire provided an example of something each manager had applied from their programme, an idea of \ntimescale and milestones\/critical events in this application and a further rating of the set of barrier and facilitator items, \nto see which ones had actually helped or hindered transfer. \nAt this stage, individuals were chosen for interview if they had provided a transfer example that needed further \nclarification or not provided an example, which may have indicated no transfer. Individuals were also chosen across \nthe range of personality preferences, as defined by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator\u00ae\u2122, an instrument suited to and \noften used in management development activities (Walck, 1990), which seeks to identify preferences for introversion \nor extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling and judging or perceiving. feedback on reported type was given \nto each manager involved in the study. \nThe 16 interviews allowed a more dynamic focus on the process of transfer and enabled greater understanding of \nmeaning attributed to transfer examples by the participants. \n \n \nData analysis  \nTo address the key research questions, interviews were transcribed and categorised using content analysis (Glaser \nand Strauss, 1967) to identify patterns in responses on the nature of learning and transfer and to verify the meaning \nattributed to these examples by the participants themselves. Quantitative data, from questionnaires and interview data \nonce categorised, were coded and were entered directly to SPSS. This allowed a test of the robustness of the list of \nperceived barriers and facilitators to transfer, using paired t-tests and factor analysis (Bryman and Cramer, 1990). \nThe strength of associations between the wide variety of data elements were also examined, including the potential \ninfluences on transfer, for which Pearson's chi-square was determined to be the most appropriate statistic (Siegel and \nCastellan, 1988). \nQualitative information from questionnaires was used in two ways. First, to identify the perceived barriers and \nfacilitators, allowing the words and phrases used by participants to guide the refinement of the resulting barriers and \nfacilitators items, working towards theoretical saturation (Miles and Hubermann, 1994). Second, using content \nanalysis, the categories originally conceptualised were extended. By summarising and categorising responses, the \nwords and phrases used by participants themselves are grouped into successively higher level categories. These were \nthen added to SPSS as nominal information, allowing their strength of association with transfer and potential influences \non transfer to be assessed statistically, again using Pearson's chi-square and the contingency coefficient to minimise \nthe effects of one variable on another (Everitt, 1992). Significance level was set at 0.05. A model was then built from \nthese associations, logically and chronologically (Dale and Davies, 1994), gradually mapping the details of the \nsignificant associations onto a basic chronological template of a learning experience, shown in Figure 1. \nThis chronology, not intended to be exhaustive, nevertheless covered the three stages of the longitudinal survey. \nBefore the programme, participants had expectations of what that programme would be about. These expectations \nwere assumed to influence (or be associated with) an individual's learning outcomes, described immediately after a \nprogramme. These were in turn assumed to influence transfer applications three to six months afterwards. It was also \nassumed that the learning experience itself, categorised by programme type, would influence expectations, learning \noutcomes and applications. \nEach of the management development programmes, which it was assumed were designed with both individual \nparticipants and their organisation's needs in mind, were categorised using Snell and James\u2019 (1994) adaptation of \nCorder's (1990) framework. This categorisation process was based on discussions with each programme's designers \nand tutors, together with a review of stated aims and objectives from course documentation, using the examples \nprovided by Snell and James (1994) to assist them. In the only case where designers and tutors could not reach a \nconsensus over both dimensions, this programme was dropped from the analysis. \n \n \nSample  \nA total of 234 managers responded to the pre-programme questionnaire, 143 to the post-programme questionnaire \nand 95 to the follow up stage. The managers themselves were between 26 and 55 years of age, 65 per cent having \nbeen managers between five and 14 years and were predominantly at middle or senior management levels within their \norganisations. Of the respondents 76 per cent were male, 24 per cent female, consistent with proportions found \nelsewhere in comparable samples. However, 85 per cent of managers, however, although coming from different \norganisations, were from the financial services sector. Of the 234 respondents, 72 per cent came from programmes \ncategorised as hard\/intangible, 16 per cent from hard\/tangible, 8 per cent soft\/intangible. The soft\/tangible programme \ntype (3 per cent) was the least well represented and findings concerning this programme type are treated with caution.\n \n \nFindings \n \n \n \nWhat barriers and facilitators do managers perceive as affecting transfer of learning?  \nParticipants perceived 26 barriers and 17 facilitators that are consistently described as affecting transfer of learning. \nThese comprise all the items from the list used in the questionnaires, plus an additional barrier identified by \nrespondents: organisational politics and hidden agendas. The barriers cluster around: lack of managerial support; time \nand workload issues; resistance to new ideas; short-termism; lack of opportunity and responsibility; physical structure \nof the organisation; performance and reward; organisational politics and hidden agendas. \nThis reinforces some of the hindering aspects identified by previous researchers: lack of peer support (Newstrom, \n1986; Tannenbaum and Yukl, 1992); group resistance to training (Patching and Higginbotham, 1994; Hastings et \nal., 1995; Holton, 1997); lack of reinforcement back on the job, time and work pressures, lack of authority, perceived \nirrelevance of the programme (Newstrom, 1986) and lack of support from the organisation (Newstrom, 1986; Holton, \n1997). However, this study has also identified a further set of obstacles to transfer, particularly organisational politics \nand hidden agendas; short-termism; the importance of lack of managerial support; physical structure of the \norganisation; responsibility issues and performance criteria. \nSimilarly with facilitators, this study supports the four areas described by previous researchers: job\/role aids, reward \n(Tannenbaum and Yukl, 1992); support, particularly from supervisors and peers (Tannenbaum and Yukl, 1992; \nHolton, 1997); plus opportunity to use learning (Holton, 1997), then adds to these: the importance of having a broader \nperspective, authority to apply learning and particularly self-determination. \nPaired t-tests on each of the items, immediately after the programme and three to six months on, showed no significant \ndifferences. This means that the transfer environment judged by participants immediately after a programme remained \nreliably consistent during the first few months of transfer. \nTable II shows each of the barrier and facilitator items, in order of highest mean score and highest percentage of \nmanagers who agreed with each item, i.e. they rated the item from five to seven on the scale. \n \n \nWhat are the strongest barriers and facilitators affecting the most participants?  \nThe top three barriers concern pressure to give priority to short-term, financial targets; day-to-day pressures of work \nand lack of time for planning. The top three facilitators are an individual's own determination, having a greater \nunderstanding of their own strengths and weaknesses and seeing the benefits of applying their learning. Each is rated \nhighly by over 70-80 per cent of participants. Together, they form an overarching cluster or \u201clayer\u201d, affecting the \nmajority of participants. \nWhen participants were grouped according to the type of programme they had experienced, this layer of barriers and \nfacilitators did not change, suggesting that if participants\u2019 views of transfer are to be improved, account must be taken \nof these items, whatever the programme and whatever the organisation. \n \n \nImportance of programme type in perceptions of barriers and facilitators to transfer  \nAside from the overall \u201clayer\u201d of barriers and facilitators, affecting the majority of participants, two further distinct layers \nwere discovered through the \u201cmapping\u201d of statistically significant associations onto the chronological framework \ndescribed in Figure 1. These \u201clayers\u201d affect different groups of individuals or are related to specific workplace features \nand are dependent on the type of programme experienced. \nThe first \u201clayer\u201d of characteristics influences perceptions of what helps and hinders transfer regardless of what \nindividuals on each programme expect, learn or apply. This is not evident in previous explorations of barriers and \nfacilitators (Huczynski and Lewis, 1980; Broad and Newstrom, 1986; Holton, 1997). \nTo give an unexpected example, on soft\/tangible programmes, having a mentor (as opposed to not having one) is \nassociated with the barriers of lack of time for planning, temptation to go back to doing things as before a programme \nand reluctance to take risks. These three barriers are most likely to affect those who have a mentor, regardless of \nexpectation, learning outcomes or application of learning. Identifying those who have a mentor and who attend \nsoft\/tangible programmes could be critical in assisting those managers prepare for transfer. At the very least, it could \nspur an exploration of the circumstances surrounding the position of the mentor (inside or outside the organisation), the \nnature of risk within the organisational context and whether particular mentoring relationships discourage new ways of \nworking, rather than embracing them. In relation to influences on barriers and facilitators, this suggests that particular \ngroups of individuals, in this case those who have a mentor, experience particular difficulties in transferring their \nlearning, that are only apparent when seen through the lens of programme type. The relationship between programme \ntype, mentoring and obstacles to transfer, requires further exploration. \nTo give a further example, managers who personally value \u201chelping others do well\u201d are facilitated in their attempts to \ntransfer learning from hard\/tangible programmes by improvements in communication between team members. This is \nnot linked to whether they have acquired particular tools and frameworks, knowledge about others or tried to apply \ntheir knowledge of strategy or skills in handling meetings. The nature of the facilitator and the managers\u2019 values here, \nsuggest reasons why the two may be associated. Improved communication within the team is likely to support others \ndoing well. If the manager can assist their team members by improving communication between them, then that too \nreinforces the manager's values. By identifying key values that managers personally hold, before they return to their \nworkplace, then attempts can be made to help maximise the benefit of communication between team members to \nassist the manager in transferring their learning from hard\/tangible programmes. \nA further \u201clayer\u201d of barriers and facilitators also depends on programme type. Again, this is not apparent in previous \nresearch into perceived barriers and facilitators to transfer of learning, but is more complicated to unravel, in that \nparticular barriers and facilitators are associated not only with particular groups of individuals or elements of the \nworkplace, but also with specific expectations of the programme, learning outcomes and applications. Understanding \nthe contextual nature of these barriers and facilitators is therefore important to building understanding of transfer of \nlearning. \nThis can be illustrated in relation to each quadrant of the learning framework. Managers on hard\/intangible \nprogrammes who expect that there will be some kind of follow-up to the programme and are attempting to solve \nproblems differently as a result of the programme, perceive lack of resources to implement new ideas from the \nprogramme to be a barrier. On hard\/tangible programmes, those who personally value the independence of the \norganisation or who are trying to apply tools and frameworks, are most likely to be helped by the knowledge that ideas \nfrom the programme will work in their area of responsibility. \nOn soft\/intangible programmes, learning outcomes related to the context of a manager's own organisation, can help \nmanagers feel that how they are rewarded is less of a barrier when they do not know what the organisation expects of \nthem. Statistical analysis could not be performed on the soft\/tangible cases owing to low cell numbers, so there is no \nequivalent example. However, the presence of such cases for other types of programme suggests that it would be \nunwise to treat every programme as if it were the same in terms of understanding which groups of managers are most \nlikely to experience particular barriers or facilitators in particular contexts. This finding also reinforces the need to carry \nout further research into the specific influences of programme type. \nThus, there are a set of barriers and facilitators to transfer, that can be divided into clusters or \u201clayers\u201d. One affects the \nmajority of respondents. Another is dependent on programme type, but is not linked in any way to the chronological \nbase model. A further layer, again dependent on programme type but with more complex links to particular parts of the \nchronological base, shows barriers and facilitators that are also associated with particular individual characteristics and \nworkplace features. These are drawn together and shown in Figure 2. \n \n \nJob satisfaction and mentoring  \nTwo individual characteristics which in this study demonstrate association with perceptions of barriers and facilitators \nand which are also dependent on programme type, are job satisfaction and having a mentor. Job satisfaction has been \nmuch researched and particularly in connection with transfer (Noe, 1986). This research therefore reinforces the need \nto consider job satisfaction as a motivational element in transfer, but also gives clues as to specific elements and \nrelationships that may give rise to a feeling of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with a manager's particular role. \nOn hard\/tangible programmes, those who are satisfied with their current role are the most likely to perceive that they \nhave the support of their manager in taking risks to apply their learning. Conversely, those who are dissatisfied with \ntheir roles are most likely to perceive a lack of interest by their manager in what they are trying to do. It is possible, \ntherefore, that on hard programmes, satisfaction or dissatisfaction with a participant's current role, is linked to \nperceptions of support (or the lack of it) from their immediate manager. \nWhy this association between dissatisfaction with role, lack of managerial support and difficulties in transferring \nlearning, should be confined to hard programmes is not clear. Programme duration did not appear to be a significant \nfactor. However, there is some evidence to suggest that the managers attending these particular programmes are at \nmore junior to middle manager levels in their organisation. It is possible that freedom to apply their learning, together \nwith their motivation to do so, may hinge on their relationship with their immediate manager. Those on the soft \nprogrammes who tended to be in more senior positions, may be less reliant on the goodwill or permission of others to \nimplement their learning. \nManagerial support is also important for transfer, whatever the programme, but was particularly stressed by 25 per \ncent of those interviewed from hard programmes, who felt that their managers needed to be aware when they were \ngoing on a programme and why. It was particularly important for managers from hard programmes to have someone \nwho could help them before and after the programme, preferably someone who had been through the programme \nthemselves and could relate that to what each individual was trying to achieve. \nThe second individual characteristic, which needs careful interpretation in relation to programme type, is the presence \nor absence of a mentor. What works for one programme, does not necessarily work on another. An illustration of this \non hard\/tangible programmes, is that not having a mentor is associated with three barriers. These are: being reluctant \nto take risks in applying learning because failure is not tolerated as part of the learning process; temptation to going \nback to old ways of doing things and; a perceived lack of commitment to ideas in the programme by others. On \nsoft\/tangible programmes, however, having a mentor is associated with very similar difficulties. On soft\/intangible \nprogrammes, not having a mentor is significantly associated with taking others into account. On hard\/intangible \nprogrammes, having a mentor is associated with perceptions of progress in transferring learning, when a manager has \nlearned to think more widely and is trying to apply that wider thinking back in the workplace. Interview data supports \nthe view, particularly from hard programme participants, that having a mentor would be useful for some (18 per cent), \nparticularly where the immediate manager may be unable to take on that role. Clearly, there is no one prescription for \ndealing with barriers and facilitators associated with having or not having a mentor, but unless programme type is \nidentified and considered, any support provided by an organisation could completely miss the mark. \n \n \nImportance of good working relationships on perceptions of transfer  \nSeveral workplace features were also significantly associated with barriers and facilitators. Relationships with \nimmediate manager, peers or direct reports as described on the questionnaire, were not significantly associated with \ndifferences in perceptions of barriers and facilitators or transfer applications, since 92 per cent of respondents \ndescribed these relationships as good. This supports Huczynski and Lewis (1980) and Facteau (1995) in suggesting \nthat good working relationships are important in assisting transfer, since the 8 per cent who described these \nrelationships as poor, were the least likely to transfer their learning. Positive perceptions of working relationships \ntherefore, may be a pre-requisite for transfer back to the workplace. \n \n \nPositive view of transfer  \nAn unexpected finding from this research was the positive view of transfer presented by participants. Much of the \nliterature (Haskell, 2001; Tannenbaum and Yukl, 1994) presents a bleak view of learners attending programmes, \nwhere, regardless of what they learn, they appear to transfer little or nothing from their experiences. An overwhelming \n92 per cent of respondents in this study, however, were able to describe something that they had transferred or were in \nthe process of transferring, from each of the programmes they had attended. In these instances, participants did of \ncourse have some of the obvious prerequisites for transfer, such as having learned something from a programme, \nfeeling the material was relevant for them and their organisations. Without these factors there can be little or no \ntransfer (Haskell, 2001). \n \n \nWhen do managers not transfer learning?  \nThe 8 per cent who did not transfer their learning however, all came from hard programmes. These managers operated \nat more junior to middle levels than those on soft programmes, but were not located in any particular function and \nshowed no correspondence in terms of age, length of time in their role or any other demographic characteristics. What \nthey did have in common was their reporting of several factors significantly associated with doing nothing differently. \nOn hard\/tangible programmes these were lack of reward, not knowing what the organisation expects of you and not \nfeeling valued. On hard\/intangible programmes, lack of reward was also associated with perceptions of no progress in \nrelation to transfer and particularly the barriers of own short-term priorities and lack of resources. Feelings of \ninsufficient reward, not feeling valued and lack of knowledge of organisational expectations, then, may be particularly \nimportant in considering why transfer may not occur on hard programmes. \nPossible reasons why managers may not feel sufficiently rewarded particularly, may be gleaned from the barriers with \nwhich this phenomenon is associated: day-to-day pressures of work, short-term priorities and lack of resources. This \nsuggests that feelings of reward are bound up with day to day pressures and workloads which can make managers \nquestion whether they are receiving sufficient benefit for long hours, heavy work schedules and tight deadlines. These \ndifficulties are unlikely to be resolved easily, but they need to be tackled if organisations are serious about improving \ntransfer. An assumption that could be explored during pre-transfer discussions is exactly what \u201creward\u201d means to the \nmanagers involved. There is a danger that organisations may be put off exploring \u201creward\u201d options if they feel that \nreward equals money. Some managers when asked about what would help them transfer their learning said receiving \nfeedback about their performance was often seen as a reward in itself. \nAlso on hard\/tangible programmes, not knowing what the organisation expects, is associated with four barriers: how \nperformance is measured; lack of commitment to ideas in the programme by others; lack of time to introduce new \nideas and; lack of interest\/support from senior managers. Without the knowledge of what the organisation expects from \nan individual, how would they know which ideas they most needed to gain commitment to or which ideas they most \nneeded to spend time introducing? \nOn soft\/intangible programmes the reverse is true: actually knowing what the organisation expects can create \ndifficulties in terms of physical distance of team members and lack of commitment to ideas from the programme by \nothers. Two possible reasons for these differences between programme types are in terms of management level and \nthe nature of ideas introduced on the programme itself. \nnother difference is the nature of the ideas introduced on the soft\/intangible programmes, which focused on concepts \nto reintroduce and re-examine the nature of balance in personal and professional lives, a process which may challenge \nmanagers\u2019 perceptions of the organisation's expectations of them. In these ways, management level and nature of \nideas introduced on the programme, may help explain some of the incongruity between what is found on soft\/intangible \nand hard\/tangible programmes. Again, this reinforces the view that perceptions of barriers and facilitators to transfer \nmake sense in the context of each type of programme. \nThe final element in the web of influences on the absence of transfer from hard programmes, is not feeling valued by \nthe organisation. Interestingly, on hard\/intangible programmes, those who do not feel valued by the organisation are \nalso the most likely to perceive the opportunity to step back from their day to day activities and reflect as helpful to \nthem in transferring their learning. Organisations who provide the time for reflection or otherwise encourage reflection, \ncould not only reduce the likelihood that their managers will not transfer what they have learned, but also help to \ndemonstrate that their contributions are of value. \n \n \nLimitations of this study  \nThe study has several limitations. Though the study may inform research into transfer from management education \nand specific skills training, these distinct types of management learning require further research to increase our \nunderstanding of how transfer operates within these particular contexts. \nThe organisational base of the study is biased towards financial services organisations, despite the fact that 17 \ndifferent organisations are represented in the sample. Care is needed in interpreting the model within the specific \ncontexts of other industries or sectors. \nFinally, the data relating to soft\/tangible programmes should be treated with caution owing to the small sample of \nmanagers from this programme type who took part in this research. Future studies should ensure larger numbers from \nthis type of programme to further understanding of this particular kind of learning experience. \n \n \nDiscussion and conclusions \nWhat do these findings mean for those involved in supporting managers in transferring learning from management \ndevelopment programmes? First, it shows that it is possible to identify the kinds of things that managers find difficult in \ntransferring their learning as well as the kinds of things they find helpful. While previously identified barriers clearly \npersist for many participants, the range of obstacles has also widened. Difficulties created by organisational politics \nand hidden agendas, for example, may not have surfaced so readily even a few years ago, but with most organisations \nhaving faced and still facing major change, these are often times when political behaviour becomes more necessary \nand more noticeable. Acknowledging the existence of hidden agendas and continuing to help managers deal more \neffectively with political behaviour, could improve the transfer experience for those facing these circumstances, \nparticularly during off line development. \nAlthough barriers and facilitators must be constantly checked to ensure that organisations are not missing vital new \ndifficulties or support factors, this research suggests three categories of barriers and facilitators that HR professionals \nmust take into account. Essentially, we start with a large group of managers experiencing the same kinds of problems \nand feeling that the same kinds of things, such as their own determination, are what really help. Time, workload and \nfinancial pressures experienced by managers may be deep-rooted, but efforts targeted here have the potential to \nlessen burdens on 70-80 per cent of those who have attended the four different types of management development \nprogrammes. Similar focus on maximising the benefits of self-determination, capitalising on individual strengths, \nsupporting managers\u2019 development needs and promoting examples of transfer which highlight both individual and \norganisational benefits of applying learning, also has the potential to reap greater rewards among 70-80 per cent of \nmanagers. \nAfter this, the scope for assisting managers becomes more specific, targeted at particular groups with particular \ncharacteristics, depending on the kind of programme they have attended. Support for learning and transfer requires \norganisations to identify and understand the teaching and learning processes and assumptions underlying the \nprogrammes they design, deliver or commission. Managers and leaders learn different things, apply different things \nand experience different obstacles and support factors depending on the kind of programme or learning experience \nthey have attended. One size does not fit all. Corder's (1990) framework adapted by Snell and James (1994), clearly \nhas potential to better understand these differences. \nOrganisations also need to consider what impact particular attitudes, such as job dissatisfaction, and workplace \npractices, may have in applying learning. Figure 2 gives a guide to characteristics that organisations should at least be \naware of, to better target support for those groups most likely to feel the effects of particular barriers, while encouraging\ngood practice in maximising facilitative elements. \nIn the absence of independent measures of changes in individual performance, or in addition to those already used by \norganisations, gauging perceptions immediately after a programme (if not during) provides a consistent and reliable \nportrait of transfer as it is likely to remain throughout the first few months of application. Individuals and organisations \ncan capitalise on this knowledge, using it to help prepare managers for the obstacles they may face, through coaching \nand action planning for example, before they return to their workplaces. \nThe findings do, however, suggest some caution may be needed in the use of certain practices that are becoming very \npopular in organisations as a form of support, most notably mentoring. This study shows that some reference is \nneeded to the type of programme attended by managers and that both managerial level and the context of the \norganisation itself, are key in making appropriate and effective use of mentoring. More junior-to-middle managers may \nfind a mentor helpful, as an alternative to their immediate manager. However, for more senior managers there may be \nissues around the position of a mentor as internal or external to the organisation and the mentor's ability to provide \nadvice that is appropriate, relevant and carries an acceptable level of risk within the organisation. \nWhen programmes are designed and delivered effectively and participants acquire learning outcomes as a result, \nthose who do apply their learning are not restricted to any particular kind of programme. All types of management and \nleadership development programmes, therefore, if they are designed and delivered appropriately, have the potential to \nenable participants to learn and transfer their learning back to their organisations. However, programmes that take a \nhard\/tangible or hard\/intangible perspective may need to be considered carefully. An exploration is needed to see if \nthey are chosen by managers who are more junior, dissatisfied with their job, feel unrewarded, undervalued and do not \nknow what the organisation expects of them. The more senior a manager becomes, the more likely they are to know \nwhat the organisation expects of them, particularly in organisations where strategy is debated and defined within those \ntop levels of management. They are also more likely to be aware of the difficulties such strategies may bring and \nwhether they will be able to meet those expectations. \nWhile there are no easy answers, greater clarity about what is expected of an individual, together with the provision or \nencouragement of opportunity to step back from day-to-day events and reflect, are areas about which organisations \ncould become more proactive. This may reduce some of the uncertainty and feelings of lack of worth that may prevent \nindividuals from applying their learning. The \u201clean\u201d organisations of the 1990s reduced the availability of space for \nreflection and for learning activity that could not demonstrate an immediate link to the business. This may have been \nparticularly the case for managers below the top echelons. At the strategic level the \u201cpersonal\u201d dimension is \nacknowledged. Yet, paradoxically this research suggests that the task and business related payoffs expected from \nsending people on \u201chard\u201d courses at business schools, may not transpire because the appropriate motivation and \nsupport for the transfer of learning may not have been understood sufficiently. It is even possible that the \u201csoft\u201d \nprogrammes, for which the learning outcomes are less specific, are those in which managers can tailor their own \nlearning so it can be transferred back to diverse organisation settings. \nThrough building a model of the influences on transfer, collecting together the significant differences between \nexpectations, learning outcomes, applications, individual characteristics and workplace features, a picture begins to \nemerge of how different learning and transfer processes are, depending on the kind of programme a participant has \nexperienced. What also emerges is how complex the nature of both learning and transfer is when trying to capture this \nin any simplified form for the purpose of exploration. However, with a clearer idea of the difficulties individuals may face \nand the support factors open to them, organisations can learn to provide appropriate relevant and worthwhile support \nwhere it is needed and by whom. \nFigure 1 Chronological base model of learning experience and transfer \n \nFigure 2 Chronological base model of potential influences on learning experience and transfer\n \n \nTable I Individual characteristics and workplace features included in pre-programme questionnaire\n \n \nTable II Perceived barriers and facilitators to transfer of learning \n \nTable II continued \n \n References \n \nArgyris, C.
