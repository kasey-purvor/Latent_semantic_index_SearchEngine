From the available evidence, it appears that family carers find themselves in an unfamiliar situation about which they lack knowledge and experience. Whilst dementia tends not to be acknowledged as a terminal illness by many family carers, they are expected to make end of life decisions on behalf of their relatives. Family carer decision-making is underpinned by values of quality of life, previously expressed wishes, comfort provision and dignity preservation.

Whilst dementia\ntends not to be acknowledged as a terminal illness by\nmany family carers, they are expected to make end of\nlife decisions on behalf of their relatives. Family carer\ndecision-making is underpinned by values of quality\nof life, previously expressed wishes, comfort provision\nand dignity preservation. This is often approached when\nfamily carers are grieving for the anticipated loss of their\nrelative and have their own personal needs that require\nto be addressed. Within a care home setting, a curative\ncare\u2013palliative care split is unhelpful in resolving these\ntensions and a model of comprehensive care appears\na more appropriate approach. This requires ongoing\ncommunication between the person with dementia,\nfamily members and professionals from the early stages\nof the condition.\nKeywords: care homes, nursing homes, dementia, family\ncarer, end of life, dying.\nBackground\nIt is estimated that 24 million people are\nliving with dementia worldwide and that this\nnumber will increase to 81 million by 2040.1 In\ndeveloped countries, as life expectancy increases\nand mortality rates for other diseases reduce,\ndementia is becoming a major cause of death.2\nThe course and trajectory of dementia can\nbe protracted and unpredictable.3,4 People with\ndementia often experience \u2018gradual death\u2019 (4; p8),\nAddress for correspondence: Jean Hennings, Inter-\nnational Observatory on End of Life Care, School of\nHealth and Medicine, Lancaster University, Lancaster\nLA1 4QT. Email: j.hennings@lancaster.ac.uk\nwith progressive physical and cognitive losses that\nresult in increased dependency. As a result, a person\nwith dementia requires escalating levels of care,5\nmaking admission into a long-term care setting\nsuch as a nursing home or care home common,6\nparticularly in the last year of life.7\nIn this paper we use the term \u2018care home\u2019 to\nrefer to a long-term care facility for elderly people,\noffering personal care alone, or nursing and\npersonal care. It is difficult to estimate the number\nof people with dementia who die in care homes,\nand figures can be misleading. Cox and Cook8\ndescribe three ways of \u2018dying with dementia\u2019:\nthose who reach the end of their lives with\ndementia but die as a result of another identified\ncondition, e.g. cancer; secondly, those who reach\nthe end of life with a mixture of physical and\nmental conditions, but cognitive impairment is not\nadvanced; and thirdly, those who die as a result\nof the complications of dementia. This review is\nlargely concerned with this third category.\nPeople with dementia are frequently not\nrecognized to be dying, and are admitted to acute\nhospitals in the final few days or weeks of life for\nthe treatment of conditions such as pneumonia or\nurinary tract infection.9 This is despite evidence\nto suggest that acute hospital admission can be\ndetrimental to people with dementia and stressful\nfor their carers.10 Estimates of death rates are\nfurther impeded by under-diagnosis of dementia.9\nHowever, the proportion of people with dementia\nwho die in nursing or residential care homes is\nestimated to be 70% in the USA.11 In the United\nKingdom (UK) it is estimated that 40% of older\npeople with dementia die at home or in a care home\nwithout on-site nursing care.12,13\nThe specific nature of dementia and, following\na medical model, its degenerative trajectory,\nmakes the context of care-giving specific and\nconstantly evolving. Family carers have to cope\nApproaching the end of life and dying with dementia in care homes 115\nwith multiple losses over a long period, resulting\nin high levels of anxiety and \u2018pre-death grief\u2019.14\nWith the progressive loss of cognitive function\nexperienced by people with dementia, family\ncarers are called upon to contribute to decision-\nmaking on behalf of their relatives. Currently,\nthe literature on family carers of people with\ndementia overwhelmingly focuses on their needs\nin the home care setting,15,16 with coping,17,18\nstress,19 quality of life16,20 and interventions to\nease care-giver burden and pre-death grief14,17,21,22\nto the fore. Care-giver resilience and predictors\nof care-giving transition from home to care home\nare also areas receiving significant attention.15,23,24\nThe specific literature on family carers of people\nwith dementia living in care homes mirrors the\ninterest in transitions of care25,26 and extends to\nexplore relationships between family carers and\nprofessional care staff.27\u201329\nWithin dementia care and care homes, end\nof life issues are increasingly recognized and are\nhighlighted in the policy debate.30,31 Research\non palliative care in care homes is centred\non the provision and quality of care,32\u201335 the\nexperiences and attitudes of professionals36\u201338 and\ntheir educational needs.39\u201341 Where the views and\nexperiences of family carers have been sought, it is\nusually to evaluate quality of life, quality of death\nand proxy views regarding a good death, on behalf\nof their relative, post-bereavement.20,42\u201345 Rarely\nhave the views and experiences of family caregivers\nin their own right been elicited.\nThis literature review aims to identify, synthesize\nand evaluate current knowledge about family\ncarers\u2019 experiences and needs regarding end of life\nand dying in care homes for people with dementia.\nRecommendations for future research will be made\nin the areas of practice, education and policy.\nSearch strategy and selection criteria\nA systematic literature review was conducted.46\nThe search strategy included the search of thirteen\nelectronic databases, eighteen web sites, a hand\nsearch of five key journals, examination of papers\nrecommended by experts working in the field and\na hand search of reference lists from relevant\npapers. A range of subject headings, key words\nand phrases were used to maximize the number\nof relevant papers. The search was carried out\nbetween May and October 2009 and revealed a\ntotal of 544 references. Empirical research papers\nthat employed qualitative and\/or quantitative\nresearch methods, \u2018grey\u2019 literature and case studies\nwere identified and selected for this review.\nFollowing a meta-ethnographic approach,47 lists\nsummarizing the original authors\u2019 findings, using\ntheir terms and concepts, were drawn up for\neach of the papers and the information was\nadded to the research summary sheet (Table 1).\nThemes and findings were compared across\nstudies to indicate relationships. Concepts that\nencompassed the papers being synthesized were\nderived, resembling second-order constructs in the\nanalysis of primary qualitative research data. The\nresults of the synthesis were shared and discussed\nby the authors to develop the final integrative\nreview of the literature. Further details of the search\nmethods and selection criteria are available from\nthe corresponding author.\nResults\nTwelve papers, reporting ten research studies,\nwere identified and met the inclusion criteria.\nOne study was conducted in Australia, one in\nEngland and one paper reports a cross-national\ncomparison of data collected in The Netherlands\nand USA; the remaining seven studies were North\nAmerican (Canada n = 1; USA n = 6). One\npaper reports survey data that used End of Life\nin Dementia Scales, but this review only includes\nfindings from the \u2018Satisfaction with Care Tool\u2019\nused to elicit family perspectives within the study.48\nThree of the studies were longitudinal, two of\nwhich collected qualitative data. One study used\na concurrent mixed methods design49 and one\nused a prospective cohort study design.2 The\nremaining nine papers report exploratory studies\nusing individual interviews or focus groups with\nfamily carers. Eleven of the papers describe the\nsetting as either \u2018nursing homes\u2019 or \u2018long-term care\nfacilities\u2019. Whilst the twelfth was conducted in a\n\u2018hospice unit\u2019, the majority of research participants\nwere care-givers of people with dementia living in\na long-term care facility and receiving care\/support\nfrom a hospice service.\nClearly, each of the studies was conducted\nwithin the context of its own policies, and legal\nand health care system, all of which have an impact\non decision-making processes; but despite obvious\ndifferences, the care of family members of people\nwith dementia at an individual level appears to be\nan issue of concern in the developed world.\n116\nJ\nH\nennings,K\nFroggatt\nand\nJ\nK\neady\nTable 1.

Family carers felt that they\nlacked knowledge of the dying process and wanted\nto understand what was happening;50 they needed\nprofessionals to explain the disease progression\nand treatment options.51\u201353 Family carers tended\nnot to regard dementia as a terminal illness,52 and\nthe process of dying was not recognized.49,52,54,55\nForbes et al. used the analogy of \u2018travelling on a\njourney\u2019 and caring for the person with dementia\nbeing likened to a \u2018rocky road\u2019 (55; p. 256). The\nhorizon on the journey tended to be limited, with\nfamily care-givers focusing on small, day-to-day\nchanges in the person\u2019s condition, rather than\nseeing the \u2018bigger picture\u2019 and the general decline,\nindicating that their relative would die.\nFamily carers describedworries about discussing\nend of life care prematurely, which affected their\ncommunication with professionals.49 From the\nfamily carer perspective, there was often a lack\nof verbal communication between professionals\nand themselves about end of life issues. However,\nthe family carers described the implicit ways in\nwhich they learnt that the condition of their relative\nwith dementia was worsening. For example, people\nwith dementia who were thought to be dying were\nexcluded from the usual social activities, leaving\nrelatives feeling anxious and confused about their\nlack of inclusion in daily activities.2,49,56\nThe studies revealed that poor, or non-existent,\nstaff\u2013family carer communication combined with\na lack of knowledge or understanding about the\nend of life process in dementia, resulted in family\ncarers constructing palliative care as being \u2018sub-\noptimal\u2019 and as \u2018giving up\u2019. As a result, there\nwas a tendency to opt for active interventions\nsuch as hospital admission, antibiotic therapy\nfor pneumonia and tube feeding, which have\nlittle proven benefit.2,49,52 When communication\ndid occur, it tended to be during times of\ncrisis, resulting in rushed decision-making,2,56\nover- or under-treatment,55 unnecessary hospital\nadmissions and further distress for relatives.2,56\nConversely, there is evidence that if family carers\nunderstand the prognosis, then their relatives with\ndementia are less likely to undergo interventions of\ndubious benefit and are more likely to receive care\naimed at offering comfort.2\nMaking decisions\nThe role of the family carer in decision-making\nfor the person with dementia living in care\nhomes is currently ill-defined and unclear.51,56\nFamily carers in the studies reviewed generally\nwished to remain involved in the decision-\nmaking process.50,51,53,57,58 Those who did not\nwish to be involved in decision-making still\nwanted their values to be reflected in decisions\nmade by professionals on their behalf.51 At\ntimes of uncertainty, family care-givers felt\nuncomfortable in their decision-making role51 and\nexpressed feelings of stress, guilt,54,55 fear, doubt49\nand anxiety.53 They felt uncomfortable making\ndecisions that might be seen to hasten death.54\nFamily care-givers used a range of values to\nunderpin the decision-making process, including\nquality of life,51,55 honouring previously expressed\nwishes,51,52 the personal history of the person\nwith dementia,51 the preservation of dignity and\nthe provision of comfort.2,49,55 Religious faith\nwas also used as a guiding force for some,52,57\nbeing used to make and confirm a wide range of\ndecisions including the withholding, continuance\nor withdrawal of treatment.57 The religious faith\nof the person with dementia was also used as a\nguide when planning individualized care.52\nWhere active communication between people\nwith dementia, their families and professionals is\nongoing, and models of shared decision-making\nare employed, decision-making appears to be less\nproblematic for family members. Family carers\nfrequently rated an item on information and\ndecision-making as not applicable in a study\nfrom the Netherlands where a model of shared\ndecision-making is in place.48 Family carers\u2019\nresponses indicated that they were well informed\nregarding the condition of their relative and that\ndecisions were shared between family carers and\nprofessionals. This shared decision-making model\nis characterized by family involvement from the\nApproaching the end of life and dying with dementia in care homes 123\nmoment of admission of the person to the nursing\nhome and open ongoing dialogue between family\nmembers and professionals.59\nThe grieving carer\nFamily carers often find themselves in the\nunenviable situation of both grieving for their\nrelative and being required to make decisions on\ntheir behalf regarding care and treatment towards\nthe end of life. The dual role of grieving carer\nand decision maker has been described as being\nproblematic when entering the palliative phase, due\nto unresolved grief.51\nFamily carers had strong personal needs\nduring this period: they wanted frequent contact\nwith staff,50 they sought empathy, reassurance,55\nunderstanding, guidance52 and communication.58\nThey attempted to meet their own needs by trying\nto personalize relationships with professionals.51\nAs mentioned above, family carers described\nthemselves as travelling in unfamiliar territory\n\u2018filled with unrecognisable landmarks\u2019 (55; p. 256);\nthey expressed a desire for a companion on the\njourney, someone who had experience of travelling\nover similar terrain, who was able to support the\ntraveller on the road.\nCarers felt validated when values and beliefs\nwere shared by professionals51,58 and fear, anger\nand guilt when they were not.50 They wanted\n\u2018peace of mind\u2019; knowing that \u2018I did everything I\ncould\u2019 (55; p. 255), and did not want to be regarded\nas \u2018giving up\u2019 on their relative (49; p. 324); they also\nhad a desire to \u2018do what\u2019s best\u2019 (52; p. 619). Family\ncarers feared that they would judge themselves as\nguilty or responsible if death occurred following\nwithdrawal of a treatment, rather than seeing the\ndeath as timely and appropriate.54 The death of the\nperson with dementia was seen both as a blessing\nand a tragedy.52,55,58 Religion was used as a source\nof meaning and hope;57 some found their faith to\nbe a source of comfort, whilst others found that it\nprovoked anxiety.57\nThere is evidence that family care-givers were\noften disappointed by the lack of contact with\nprofessionals caring for their relative.53,58 This is\ndespite data suggesting great need and efforts on\nthe part of carers to meet those needs. In survey\ndata, family care-givers rated the lowest an item\nregarding knowing the doctor or nurse in charge\nof the care of their relative48 and as few as 18% of\nrelatives said that they had been given the prognosis\nby a physician,2 suggesting lack of communication\nwith professionals.\nThe encouragement of \u2018hands on caring\u2019\nby family members is suggested as a means\nof developing relationships and trust with\nprofessionals.58 A hands-on caring strategy was\nused by some family care-givers, and in addition\nto assisting in the development of relationships\nwith professionals, it was reported to reduce their\nfeelings of loss and levels of stress.53\nIn their conclusions, authors suggest that the\npalliative care\/curative care dichotomy is an\nunhelpful approach in this setting. A model\nof \u2018comprehensive care\u2019 with an emphasis on\nensuring a good quality of life with comfort care\nis proposed.49,51 Quality of life for the person\nwith dementia can only be achieved by early\nand open discussion between professionals, the\nperson with dementia and their family members.\nHowever, hospice staff lacked skills and knowledge\nin dementia care.53,56 Whilst care home staff tend\nto have experience and skills in dementia care, they\nlack counselling and communication skills.49,53\nThrough improved communication, wishes can\nbe ascertained, individualized care delivered and\ndecision-making lightened for family members\ntowards the end of the life of their relative.49,51,52\nForbes55 and Gessert54 propose the continued\nuse of the advance care planning model with\nthe appointed proxy as a way of normalizing\ndiscussions and developing communication with\nfamily members.\nThis literature review highlighted a group of\nfamily members who were only described by one\ngroup of authors. Sanders et al.53 describe four\ncare-giver portraits: questioning, all-consumed,\nreconciled and disengaged. Whilst three of the\nportraits are described in the findings of other\nresearchers, the disengaged care-givers are not.\nThe disengaged care-givers were \u2018emotionally\ndisconnected\u2019 (53; p. 537) from their familymember\nwith dementia, and were engaged with their own\nlives, families and work. Characteristic themes\nwithin the portrait of the disengaged care-giver\nwere: conflict between person with dementia and\nthe family care-giver, focus on self and career,\nminimal involvement in care and being prepared\nfor the death of their relative. They were a group\nwho were exclusively adult children of the person\nwith dementia of either gender, with a mean age of\n50 years.\n124 J Hennings, K Froggatt and J Keady\nDiscussion\nThis literature review has highlighted the fact that\nthere is limited research in the area, but it is clear\nthat there are high levels of unmet need,53,56,58 a\nfinding that is supported by Scott and Pace.32 The\nissues raised by this review of the literature are\nmultifaceted and therefore need to be addressed at\nvarious levels, through research, policy, education\nand practice.\nFrom a research perspective there is limited\nresearch in the area, a lack of longitudinal studies\nand a lack of studies involving interventions or\nclinical trials. The \u2018disengaged carer\u2019 is identified\nand described in only one study,53 raising the ques-\ntion: \u2018Is this a unique finding or have other studies\nfailed to recognize this group, due to the methods\nof recruitment or to the research approach?\u2019\nFor individual family members the review\nof the literature shows that families wanted\ncommunication, information and support in their\ndecision-making. It is encouraging that there\nare many examples of good practice that are\ncurrently being evaluated.32,60 There are also\nmodels of practice where memory clinics are\ninvolved in giving the diagnosis to the person with\ndementia and their families. In this setting, open\ncommunication is developed and care is tailored to\nindividual needs.10 It is at this early stage in the\ndisease process that proxy decision makers may be\nappointed2 and the values and wishes of the person\nwith dementia can be elicited and shared. This may\nbe done as part of post-diagnostic work, in clinics\nor in the home, by members of the community\npalliative care team or general practitioner.10,61\nAdmiralNursesmay also take on this role. They are\nspecialist dementia care nurses in the UK, who have\na registeredmental health nursing qualification and\nwho practice in the community. The casework\nof the Admiral Nurse focuses primarily on the\nneeds of the family and its wider network in the\nsupport, care and empowerment of the person\nwith dementia. Whilst Advanced Care Planning\nis recommended by some authors,55 others have\nfound that doctor\u2019s decisions were influenced more\nby the patient\u2019s condition, assumptions about the\nquality of life of the individual as indicated by\ninformation gleaned from a wide range of sources\nand involving the family, and less on advanced care\nplanning directives.59\nFrom an educational perspective, the review\nhas highlighted that family members perceived\nprofessionals as lacking preparation and education\nfor their role in guiding and supporting family care-\ngivers in their decision making.51,55,56 Professional\ncarers were also perceived to lack communication\nand counselling skills.49,53 Inconsistency of care\nprovider and lack of care planning resulted\nin rushed, poor decision making at times of\ncrisis.2,10,56 In keeping with these findings, hospital\nstaff in acute settings have reported themselves to\nbe ill-equipped to cope and respond to the needs of\npeople with dementia, tending to rely on family\nmembers to provide nursing care.10 In the UK,\nnational minimum standards have been set for the\ninclusion of dementia-specific training of staff in\nboth health and social care settings.62\nAt a policy level, it is important that the general\npublic are encouraged to think and speak about\ntheir values and wishes regarding end of life\ncare, during the course of \u2018normal conversations\u2019.\nThis will have the dual effect of informing\nothers regarding their wishes and views, but\nwill also normalize such discussions and remove\nthe associated stigma. Recently published policy\ndocuments have encouraged public awareness of\ndementia and end of life issues.30,31 In the UK\nthe National Council on Bioethics have issued a\nConsultation paper to stimulate discussion, collect\nviews and develop policies.63 TheNational Council\nfor Palliative Care have also been working to\ndevelop collaborations between the disciplines of\npalliative care and dementia care.64 Also on a more\nindividual level, several public figures have openly\ndiscussed their own diagnosis of dementia and their\nfuture care wishes,65 or their role in caring for\na family member with dementia.66 Whilst there\nis a long way to go, this has helped open the\npublic policy debate and has started to bring the\n\u2018unfamiliar territory\u2019 into the public domain.\nConclusion\nThis literature review has identified little literature,\nbut indicates high levels of unmet need. Family\nmembers find themselves in an unfamiliar situation\nabout which they lack knowledge and experience.\nThey find end of life decision making in\nthe face of uncertainty stressful. They also\nhave personal needs, as they are simultaneously\ngrieving and caring. There is evidence that\nfamily care-givers seek communication, guidance\nand companionship from professionals, but are\nApproaching the end of life and dying with dementia in care homes 125\nfrequently disappointed. There is a need for more\nresearch, especially longitudinal studies, in order\nthat the needs and experiences of this group of\ncare-givers might be better understood.\nAcknowledgements\nJH was funded to write this literature review\nby a scholarship from the Cancer Experiences\nCollaborative, a palliative and supportive care\nresearch funded collaborative funded by the UK\nNational Cancer Research Institute (NCRI).\nConflicts of interest\nThe authors declared no conflicts of interest.\nReferences\n1 Ferri C, Prince M, Brayne C, Brodaty H,\nFratiglioni L, Gnaguli M et al.
