Res., 115, C12017,\ndoi:10.1029\/2010JC006338.\n1. Introduction\n[2] A large number of in situ oceanic studies have inves-\ntigated ocean dispersion in the context of single\u2010particle\ndispersion theory [Taylor, 1921]. This theory describes how\na tracer cloud spreads from its release point as a function of\nthe eddy fluctuations in a turbulent flow field, characterized\nby a Lagrangian length scale. If the position of a particle in\nthe cloud is x(t), then the cloud\u2019s spreading can be quantified\nby the absolute dispersion hx2i, where h\u00b7i indicates an\nensemble average over the particles. Alternatively, by anal-\nogy with molecular diffusion [Taylor, 1921; Davis, 1982],\nthe spreading can be expressed as an effective diffusivity\n\u0001 = 12\nd\ndthx(t)2i. If the turbulent field is stationary and\nhomogeneous then the effective diffusivity asymptotes to a\nconstant value after the particle has traveled a distance\nexceeding the largest eddies in the turbulent field (which are\ngenerally larger than the characteristic Lagrangian length\nscale). This asymptotic behavior is the random walk regime\n[Taylor, 1921]. Before this, the effective diffusivity grows\nwith time, proportional to time at very short times (the bal-\nlistic regime) then transitioning from ballistic toward random\nwalk behavior at intermediate times.\n[3] While single\u2010particle dispersion quantifies the abso-\nlute rate of a cloud spreading at large scales, it does not\ncharacterize the spreading of particles about the center of\nmass of a cloud at small or intermediate scales. Furthermore,\nfocusing on a single length scale to characterize the turbu-\nlent flow neglects the fact that the flow is characterized by a\nrange of scales. The amount of energy at a particular scale\ndetermines how a tracer cloud will be stirred relative to its\ncenter of mass at that scale. This stirring can be quantified\nby observing the spreading of pairs within the cloud. For\nexample, consider a pair of drifters separated by a distance\nd(t). The rate of change of d(t) can be dominated by eddies\nof comparable scale if they have sufficient energy, because\nsmaller eddies add a relatively weak random walk and\nlarger eddies move the pair as a coherent unit to lowest\norder [Corrsin, 1962]. Thus, the spreading rate of particle\npairs is sensitive to the distribution of energy as a function\nof length scale in the turbulent flow, i.e., the slope of the\nEulerian wave number spectrum. Under the assumption of\ntwo\u2010dimensional, stationary turbulence with velocity wave\nnumber spectrum E(k) \/ k\u2212a, it can be shown [see Morel\nand Larcheveque, 1974; LaCasce, 2008] that\n1\n2\nd\ndt\nd2\n\u0001 \u0003 \/ d\u0003\u00fe12 for 1 < \u0003 < 3: \u00f01\u00de\nThis is the range in which pair spreading is primarily\ndriven by eddies of the same scale as the separation of the\npair, a condition known as \u201clocal dispersion\u201d [Bennett,\n1984]. However, if the wave number spectrum is steeper\n(a \u2265 3), pair spreading is dominated by eddies larger than\nthe separation distance; the separation grows exponentially,\ni.e., hd2i \/ exp(t) [Bennett, 1984], and the spreading is\n\u201cnonlocal\u201d.\n[4] Richardson [1926] first characterized turbulent stirring\nby quantifying particle pair separation. His observations\nincluded smoke spreading from a stack, seeds and balloons\nreleased into the air, and later [Richardson and Stommel,\n1NOAA Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory,\nMiami, Florida, USA.\n2National Oceanography Centre, Liverpool, UK.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/10\/2010JC006338\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 115, C12017, doi:10.1029\/2010JC006338, 2010\nC12017 1 of 20\n1948] floating pieces of parsnip dropped from a pier.\nRichardson [1926] proposed that hd2i \/ t3, indicating that\nthe rate of separation ddtd increases with increasing separa-\ntion. This implies that the relative diffusivity K = 12\nd\ndthd2i,\nthe two\u2010particle analogue of the single\u2010particle absolute\ndiffusivity, is scale dependent: K \/ d4\/3, a relationship now\nknown as Richardson\u2019s law. Richardson\u2019s law behavior\npersists until d exceeds the largest eddies in the turbulent\nfield (if such a limit exists). Past that, the separation con-\ntinues as a random walk hd2i \/ t, with constant K equal to\ntwice the single\u2010particle diffusivity \u0001 [Richardson, 1926].\n[5] Richardson [1926] was instrumental in characterizing\nthree\u2010dimensional turbulence as the superposition of eddies\nwith a range of scales, and with energy cascading from\nthe largest eddies to the scale of molecular dissipation.\nAssuming that the small\u2010scale flow is homogeneous and\nisotropic, with statistics set by the molecular diffusion and\nthe rate of energy dissipation, Kolmogorov [1941] showed\nthat the velocity wave number spectrum in this \u201cinertial\u201d\nscale range must be E(k) \/ k\u22125\/3. Then, from (1), the\nrelative diffusivity is K \/ d4\/3, i.e., Richardson\u2019s law.\n[6] In the quasigeostrophic (QG) limit, motion at scales\nlarge enough to feel the vertical boundaries (2\u2010D barotropic\nmotion) exhibit the same wave number slope as 3\u2010D\nturbulence at scales from the Rossby radius of deforma-\ntion Ld up to the largest scales of the turbulent flow\n[Kraichnan, 1967], although the energy cascade across this\nrange is from smaller to larger scales, opposite to the energy\ncascade in 3\u2010D turbulence. At scales smaller than Ld, 2\u2010DQG\nturbulence has a second inertial range in which enstrophy\n(squared vorticity) cascades downscale and the velocity\nspectral slope is far steeper, E(k) \/ k\u22123 [Kraichnan, 1967;\nCharney, 1971]. In this enstrophy cascade range, particle pair\nspreading is controlled by the rate of strain of the large,\nenergy\u2010containing eddies in the energy cascade range\n[Kraichnan, 1967], i.e., the dispersion is weakly nonlocal\n[Bennett, 1984], and particle pair separation is exponential.\nThus, one expects particle pairs in 2\u2010D QG turbulence to\nseparate exponentially while their separation distance is\nsmaller than Ld, then follow Richardson\u2019s law at separation\ndistances from Ld to the largest eddies in the flow. At larger\nseparation distances, the separation should revert to a random\nwalk characterized by a constant diffusivity.\n[7] More recently, focus has turned to the behavior of\nquasigeostrophic turbulence in the presence of a boundary\nsuch as the ocean surface. The framework of this surface\nquasigeostrophic (SQG) theory was developed by Blumen\n[1978]. Away from the surface boundary, SQG can revert\nto 2\u2010D geostrophic turbulence at large scales, in which the\nflow is driven by large\u2010scale potential vorticity (PV) var-\niations (in its simplest formulation, SQG has constant PV in\nthe interior and the flow is limited to the surface). At the\nsurface boundary, SQG dynamics are driven by lateral\nvariations in density anomaly [Blumen, 1978]. These var-\niations are not constrained by the vertical velocity (as in the\ninterior), and thus SQG flow generates sharp vorticity gra-\ndients at the surface. These gradients in turn lead to energy\ninjection at submesoscales, and create an inverse energy\ncascade from the submesoscale through the mesoscale\n[Capet et al., 2008]. This surface boundary layer flow\ndominates the interior QG flow at the surface for bar-\noclinically unstable flow forced by the large\u2010scale density\ngradient [Lapeyre and Klein, 2006]. SQG has been shown to\ndescribe the surface flow in numerical simulations of the\nNorth Atlantic where mesoscale activity is large (as in the\nGulf Stream region) and where the mixed layer is deep\n[Isern\u2010Fontanet et al., 2008]. The surface mode of SQG\ndominates North Atlantic simulations in the Gulf Stream\nand North Atlantic Drift regions, while the interior first\nbaroclinic mode is dominant in less energetic regions such\nas the recirculating Azores Current region [Lapeyre, 2009].\nAs a consequence of SQG dynamics, the velocity wave\nnumber spectral slope at scales smaller than the mesoscale is\nmuch shallower than in the enstrophy cascade range of 2\u2010D\nQG turbulence, with a slope of k\u22125\/3 [Blumen, 1978] for\nlinear (purely geostrophic) SQG. Extremely high\u2010resolution\nprimitive equation simulations, which can ignore the QG\nassumption of small Rossby number flow, reproduce several\nkey predictions of SQG theory including a flattening of the\nnear\u2010surface velocity wave number slope for a range of\nscales smaller than Ld [Klein et al., 2008]. Thus, SQG theory\npredicts Richardson\u2019s law behavior for the relative disper-\nsion from the submesoscale, O(1 km), to the scale at which\nthe bottom boundary is felt by the flow and it behaves like\n2\u2010D turbulence [Tulloch and Smith, 2006]. An extension of\nSQG theory that includes two active interior modes [Tulloch\nand Smith, 2009] demonstrates that the transition from SQG\nto 2\u2010D QG turbulence occurs at the deformation radius\nLd when the near\u2010surface shear of the flow greatly exceeds\nthe magnitude of the speed divided by the fluid depth. This is\ngenerally the case in the ocean, but not in the atmosphere\nwhere the transition occurs at smaller scales [Tulloch and\nSmith, 2009]. At larger scales, Richardson\u2019s law behavior\nis consistent with 2\u2010D QG turbulence as noted above.\n[8] The presence of large\u2010scale mean shear can com-\nplicate the interpretation of dispersion. For example,\n[Bennett, 1987; LaCasce, 2008], in the presence of a\nmeridionally sheared zonal flow U(y), a pair with\nmeridional separation dy will spread in the zonal direction\naccording to\n< d2x >\u00bc\ndU\ndy\n\u0004 \u00052\n< d2y > t\n2:\nIf the meridional spreading is a random walk, i.e., h dy2 i\/ t,\nthen the zonal dispersion will be proportional to t3\n(Richardson\u2019s law). Shear dispersion is highly anisotropic,\nand the zonal and meridional separation rates is correlated\nwhile (in this simple example) the zonal and meridional eddy\nspeeds of the two particles are uncorrelated at all scales.\n[9] There are relatively few observational studies to assess\nthe disparate predictions of 2\u2010D QG turbulence and SQG\ntheory at subdeformation radius scales. Altimetry\u2010derived\nsea height anomaly spectral slopes are flatter than predicted\nby 2\u2010D QG turbulence, and are instead consistent with SQG\ntheory [Le Traon et al., 2008]. However, velocity spectra\ncalculated from repeated ADCP crossings of the Gulf\nStream exhibit a k\u22123 slope, consistent with 2\u2010D QG turbu-\nlence [Wang et al., 2010]. Qualitatively, observations of\nsubmesoscale vortex merging [Flament et al., 2001] imply\nan inverse kinetic energy cascade at the submesoscale, as\npredicted by SQG. In situ relative dispersion studies are\nrare. LaCasce and Bower [2000] examined subsurface floats\nfrom several experiments in the eastern and western North\nLUMPKIN AND ELIPOT: DRIFTER PAIR SPREADING C12017C12017\n2 of 20\nAtlantic, but were forced to rely on pairs that encountered\neach other by chance (a constraint that severely reduces the\nability to resolve relative dispersion at submesoscales).\nFloats in the eastern Atlantic did not demonstrate correlated\nvelocities at the closest resolvable distance of O(10 km), and\nthus measured absolute (single particle) dispersion, with\nrandom walk behavior at separations greater than \u223c50 km.\nThe western float pairs of LaCasce and Bower [2000] had\ncorrelated velocities for separation distances from 10 km up\nto \u223c100 km, and exhibited Richardson\u2019s law behavior in this\nrange. The dispersion was isotropic across all scales. At\nseparations greater than 200 km, the western float pairs\ndispersed in a random walk. More recently, Ollitrault et al.\n[2005] examined subsurface float pairs in the western and\neastern North Atlantic with initial separation of a few kilo-\nmeters, and found early, brief exponential separation for\ntheir 16 eastern float pairs. All floats exhibited Richardson\u2019s\nlaw dispersion for 40\u2013300 km separation, and random walk\ndispersion at larger separation. Exponential separation at\nscales smaller than the Rossby radius is consistent with QG\nturbulence. It should be noted that intermediate to deep\nsubsurface float dispersion wouldn\u2019t be affected by the\nO(250 m) ocean surface boundary, and should thus behave\naccording to standard QG theory. In contrast, surface drifters\nshould feel the boundary flow of SQG theory, where that\ntheory applies.\n[10] The most comprehensive study of surface drifter\nrelative dispersion is LaCasce and Ohlmann [2003].\nLaCasce and Ohlmann [2003] examined the spreading rate\nof drifter pairs and triplets gathered from three extremely\ndense arrays of Coastal Ocean Dynamics Experiment\u2010type\n(also known as Davis\u2010type) drifters deployed in the Gulf of\nMexico, north and west of the energetic Loop Current.\nThese drifters were tracked by Argos positioning [see\nLumpkin and Pazos, 2007], which, prior to January 2005,\nprovided 5\u20137 position fixes per day. These fixes were\ninterpolated to daily resolution [LaCasce, 2008] for their\ndispersion calculations. Few of the drifters were deployed as\npairs, so LaCasce and Ohlmann [2003] had to rely heavily\nupon \u201cchance pairs\u201d: pairs that happened to come close to\neach other. LaCasce and Ohlmann [2003] found that the\ndrifter pairs separated exponentially from the smallest\nresolvable distance of O(1 km) to 40\u201350 km, the local\ndeformation radius, consistent with the predictions of 2\u2010D\nQG turbulence in the enstrophy cascade inertial subrange.\nAt larger separations, the pairs spread at a rate consistent\nwith Richardson\u2019s law and QG turbulence in the inverse\nenergy cascade subrange.\n[11] LaCasce and Ohlmann [2003] stated that they found\na consistent exponential spreading rate at subdeformation\nradius scales using two methods: relative dispersion and\nfinite\u2010scale Lyapunov exponents (FSLEs, described in detail\nlater in this paper), with the transition from exponential to\nRichardson\u2019s law behavior happening near the deformation\nradius in both methods. However, more recently LaCasce\n[2008] raised doubt on this conclusion. He noted that the\nspreading rates were not consistent between these two\nmethods, since LaCasce and Ohlmann [2003] compared a\ndistance\u2010squared rate from relative dispersion to a distance\nrate from the FSLEs. He also found that the temporal res-\nolution of the data strongly affected the FSLE results, and\nthat smooth interpolation of the data to increasingly higher\ntemporal resolution shifted the apparent transition from\nexponential to Richardson\u2019s law behavior to increasingly\nsmaller scales [LaCasce, 2008].\n[12] Most recently, Koszalka et al. [2009] examined the\ndispersion of a large number of drifter pairs in the Nordic\nSeas, most of which were launched together. They found\nexponential separation up to the local deformation radius,\nand then separation consistent with Richardson\u2019s law to\n\u223c100 km. However, because of the small Rossby radius\n(10 km) in that region, the pairs reached the transition\nfrom exponential to Richardson spreading in a relatively\nbrief 2 days.\n[13] In this study, we examine the spreading of 55 drifter\npairs deployed in tight clusters in the Gulf Stream, in\nFebruary\u2013March 2007, as part of the CLIVAR Mode\nWater Dynamics Experiment (CLIMODE). The drifters\u2019\nspreading was resolved at approximately hourly resolution.\nAt scales from \u223c1\u20133 km to 300\u2013500 km, we find disper-\nsion exhibiting Richardson\u2019s law behavior, while at larger\nscales the pair spreading is consistent with a single\u2010particle\nconstant effective diffusivity of O(1\u20132 \u00d7 104 m2 s\u22121). The\nbehavior from 1\u20133 km to the first baroclinic Rossby radius\nof 30 km [Chelton et al., 1998] is qualitatively different\nthan the Gulf of Mexico drifters described by LaCasce and\nOhlmann [2003] and Koszalka et al. [2009], i.e., not\nseparating exponentially before reaching the deformation\nradius. To explore why we find this subdeformation\u2010scale\nbehavior, we also examine the spreading of drifter pairs\naway from the Gulf Stream region, the spreading of Gulf\nStream chance pairs in the historical drifter data set, and\nthe effect of lowered temporal resolution on our calcula-\ntions. We conclude that drifters in the Gulf Stream region\ndo not exhibit exponential separation at scales larger than\n1\u20133 km. We interpret this as evidence of significant energy\ninput at the submesoscale which flattens the wave number\nspectrum. This behavior is consistent with the predictions\nof surface quasigeostrophic turbulence theory. We also\nfind that reduced temporal resolution can contaminate the\nFSLE calculations and produce (spurious) exponential\nseparation at the submesoscale. For drifter pairs in the\nmore quiescent eastern subtropical Atlantic, we find more\nequivocal results: relative dispersion at scales smaller than\nthe Rossby radius is extremely noisy, with large error bars,\nbut is better explained by exponential separation than by\nRichardson\u2019s law behavior. In contrast, the FSLE results\nfrom the eastern drifter pairs indicate that the pairs separate\naccording to Richardson\u2019s law at the submesoscale.\n2. Data\n[14] All observations analyzed in this study were col-\nlected by satellite\u2010tracked surface drifters, drogued at 15 m\nto follow near\u2010surface currents [Niiler, 2001; Lumpkin and\nPazos, 2007]. Since January 2005 multisatellite tracking has\nprovided a location fix for each drifter every 1\u20132 h [Elipot\nand Lumpkin, 2008]. These position fixes are rated ac-\ncording to \u201clocation class\u201d: class 3 (uncertainty <150 m),\nclass 2 (150\u2013300 m), class 1 (350\u20131000 m), and class 0\n(uncertainty >1 km). In this study, no class 0 fixes were\nused.\n[15] All drifters include either a submergence or a tether\nstrain sensor for determining drogue presence. These data\nLUMPKIN AND ELIPOT: DRIFTER PAIR SPREADING C12017C12017\n3 of 20\nare used to determine the drogue off time for each drifters.\nBecause undrogued drifters are subject to significant slip,\ni.e., motion relative to the current at 15 m [Niiler and\nPaduan, 1995], trajectories from drifters that had lost\ntheir drogues were not examined in this study.\n2.1. CLIMODE Drifter Array\n[16] As part of the CLIVAR Mode Water Dynamics\nExperiment [Marshall et al., 2009], an array of 60 drifters\nwas deployed in the Gulf Stream and its anticyclonic\nrecirculation in February\u2013March 2007 from the R\/V Knorr\n(Figure 1). The overall goal of CLIMODE is to better\nunderstand the processes governing the formation and\nevolution of North Atlantic subtropical mode water. The\ndrifter array was intended to provide measurements of\neddy stirring in the formation region of this mode water,\nand to provide in situ sea surface temperature and velocity\nmeasurements for calibration and validation of satellite\u2010\nbased products.\n[17] The drifters were deployed in pairs or trios, each\nlaunched over the span of a few seconds with an initial\nseparation of a few meters maximum. One of the drifters\nfailed to transmit any data. The other 59 drifters provided\ncontinuous fixes with one exception, a gap of 17.2 days for\none drifter after 3.7 days in the water. Neglecting this gap,\nthe median, mean, and standard deviation of the temporal\ngap between fixes was 0.96, 1.17, and 1.55 h, respectively;\n23% of the fixes were class 3, 44% were class 2, and 33%\nwere class 1. Conservatively assuming that each fix had the\nlargest possible error for its class, the overall mean error for\nall fixes was approximately 500 m. If the error for each\ndrifter in a pair is independent, then the separation distance\nhad a mean error of\nffiffiffi\n2\np\n\u00d7 500 = 700 m. Separation distances\nsmaller than this were not significantly different from zero.\nOf the 59 drifters in the array, 55 pairs had their earliest\nsatellite position fixes placing them less than 700 m apart.\n[18] We linearly interpolated the raw fixes of the drifters\nto regular hourly intervals at 0000 UTC, 0100 UTC, etc.,\nwith the 17.24 day gap left uninterpolated. Velocities were\ncalculated by a centered 2 h difference. The center of mass\nof each drifter pair was calculated as the mean latitude and\nlongitude of the two drifters in the pair.\n2.2. Chance Drifter Pairs in the Gulf Stream Region\n[19] Several previous studies such as LaCasce and Bower\n[2000] and LaCasce and Ohlmann [2003] relied heavily\nupon chance pairs. It is possible that, by selectively isolating\nregions of surface convergence or confluence, such pairs are\nnot homogeneously sampling the turbulent field in a sta-\ntistical sense [LaCasce and Ohlmann, 2003]. To evaluate\nhow this might affect our results in the Gulf Stream region,\nwe identified all drifter pairs in the region (25\u201345\u00b0N, 40\u2013\n80\u00b0W) in the historical drifter data set that came within\n10 km of each other by chance (Figure 2) since January\n2005, the introduction of multisatellite processing. Some\nof these pairs were not chance pairs, as they had been\nlaunched together; we identified and eliminated these non-\nchance pairs. A total of 29 chance pairs (58 drifters) came\nwithin 10 km, but only nine pairs came within 700 m, the\nthreshold used for relative dispersion of the CLIMODE\ndrifters. We used these nine pairs for relative dispersion\nFigure 1. The CLIMODE drifter array. Deployment positions are shown for pairs (circles) and trios\nduring leg 1 of the cruise (February 2007) and trios during leg 2 (March 2007; inverted triangles).\nSubsequent drifter trajectories are shown in black (February), dark gray (March), and light gray (1\nApril to 7 July, the final data analyzed here).\nLUMPKIN AND ELIPOT: DRIFTER PAIR SPREADING C12017C12017\n4 of 20\nFigure 2.

Drifter Pairs in the Eastern Subtropical\nNorth Atlantic\n[20] Although the primary focus of this study is the\nCLIMODE drifter array, we will seek additional insight on\nour results by comparing drifter pair spreading in the ener-\ngetic Gulf Stream region to drifter pair spreading in the more\nquiescent eastern subtropical North Atlantic. In 2005\u20132006,\na number of drifter clusters were launched throughout the\nAtlantic Ocean for the AOML Drifting Buoy (ADB) eval-\nuation study. Each cluster consisted of four drifters, one\nfrom each of the four major drifter manufacturers, each with\nthe same nondimensional drag area ratio that determines\ntheir water\u2010following characteristics [Niiler et al., 1987].\nThe drifters in each cluster were launched within a few\nmeters of each other. The purpose of the ADB study is to\nevaluate the packaging, activation, and postdeployment\nlifetime and behavior of the sensors, drogues and transmit-\nters; the ability to examine pair separation is a side benefit.\n[21] Six of these four\u2010drifter clusters were launched in\nthe eastern subtropical Atlantic (22\u201335\u00b0N, 15\u201345\u00b0W)\n(Figure 3), each providing up to six possible drifter pairs\n(fewer pairs were realized in clusters where one or more\ndrifters failed on deployment or indicated drogue lost upon\ndeployment). Details of launch times, locations, and pairs\nare given in Table 1. A total of 18 drifter pairs had their\nfirst satellite fixes placing them within 700 m of each\nother, i.e., not significantly different from zero, and were\nused for calculating relative dispersion. All possible pairs\nwere used for calculating finite\u2010scale Lyapunov exponents.\n3. Methods\n[22] In this study, we shall quantify pair spreading using\ntwo methods: relative dispersion and finite\u2010scale Lyapunov\nexponents.\n3.1. Relative Dispersion\n[23] Relative dispersion is the mean pair separation dis-\ntance squared as a function of time\nD2 t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc d2n t\u00f0 \u00de\n\u0001 \u0003\n; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere dn is the separation distance of pair n at time t after\nrelease. In this study, only drifter pairs with an initial sep-\naration distance less than 700 m (the noise level of dn) are\nused to calculate relative dispersion. This constraint im-\nposes a strict limit on the number of pairs that can go into\nthe calculation (Figure 4, top), but is necessary to resolve\ndispersion properly at small times after release. As time\nincreases, the number of pairs going into the calculation\nwill decrease due to drifters dying or losing their drogues.\n[24] The effective relative diffusivity is given by the time\nrate of change of D2 (t). Thus, the slope of D2 (t) versus t in\na log\u2010log plot indicates the dispersion regime experienced\nby the particles as they are stirred by the turbulent field. This\ndispersion regime is often observed to change with\nincreasing time [see Taylor, 1921; LaCasce, 2008]. The\ndiffusive regime is D2 (t) \/ t (i.e., a constant effective dif-\nfusivity). \u201cBallistic\u201d dispersion is D2 (t) \/ t2. Richardson\u2019s\nlaw behavior is D2 (t) \/ t3. The exponential separation\nregime is D2 (t) \/ exp(t).\n3.2. Finite\u2010Scale Lyapunov Exponents\n[25] Finite\u2010scale Lyapunov exponents are an alternative\napproach to examine particle pair separation. In this\napproach, one examines the growth of the ensemble\u2010\naveraged separation distance d (the use of d rather than d\nindicates that this distance is calculated as an ensemble\naverage in spatial bins). This separation distance d is\nTable 1.

(top) Number of CLIMODE drifter pairs with\ninitial separation distance less than 700 m, as a function\nof time after deployment. Drifter deaths and drogue losses\nreduce the initial value, 55 pairs, to 26 pairs after 122 days\nand to 0 after 149 days. The increase at day 20 is caused by a\ndrifter resuming transmissions after a gap of 17.2 days. (bot-\ntom) Number of pairs with separation distance falling within\neach distance bin [dn, dn+1] used to calculate the finite\u2010scale\nLyapunov exponents. Note that a pair can provide more than\none estimate of the FSLE within a bin (see Appendix A).\nLUMPKIN AND ELIPOT: DRIFTER PAIR SPREADING C12017C12017\n6 of 20\nquantified as d = d0 exp(lt), i.e., exponential growth if\nthe Lyapunov exponent l is constant [Artale et al., 1997;\nAurell et al., 1997]. More generally, l can vary as a\nfunction of d. Over an interval [dn, dn+1] in which l is\napproximately constant, (tn+1 \u2212 tn)l = ln(dn+1\/dn). For dn+1 =\nadn, this becomes\n\u0004 \u0005n\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc ln\u0003Dtn ; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere Dtn = tn+1 \u2212 tn is the time for the separation\ndistance to grow from dn to adn. In practice, l is cal-\nculated by identifying Dtn for each pair with separation\ngrowing from d to ad, and averaging the right\u2010hand side\nof (3) over all pairs. Because this calculation is conducted\nover a finite\u2010scale range (a > 1), it is known as the\nfinite\u2010scale Lyapunov exponent.\n[26] Because l is an inverse time scale, the slope of l\nversus d in a log\u2010log plot can be related to the various\ndispersion regimes. In general, steeper slopes indicate\nslower dispersion. For Richardson\u2019s law behavior, one\nwould expect l \/ d\u22122\/3 from dimensional arguments [Haza\net al., 2008]. For diffusive behavior, l \/ d\u22122. Steeper slopes\nare associated with subdiffusive behavior, which can be\ncaused by particle trapping in coherent vortices [Provenzale,\n1999], while constant l versus d indicates exponential\nseparation associated with chaotic advection [see Aref,\n1984]. More generally, if the dispersion D2 \/ ta, then\nl \/ d\u22122\/a [LaCasce, 2008].\n[27] The FSLE approach sorts the data by separation\ndistance, rather than averaging in time as done when cal-\nculating relative dispersion. Thus, it is more appropriate if\nthe processes governing pair spreading are scale dependent.\nAlso, as a consequence of spatial averaging, all possible\nparticle pairs can be included in the calculation, regardless\nof their minimum or initial separation. Thus, with increasing\nseparation distance, an increasing number of pairs can be\nidentified for calculating l (Figure 4, bottom). This is in\nsharp contrast to relative dispersion, which relies upon a\ndata set that decreases with increasing time (Figure 4, top) as\ndrifters in the original pairs die or lose their drogues.\n[28] However, there are some drawbacks to the FSLE\napproach. The results can be sensitive to data temporal\nresolution at small separation scales [LaCasce, 2008]. Also,\nthere is not a consensus on how to calculate l for pairs when\ntheir separation distance does not grow monotonically.\nThese issues, and the algorithm we use to implement (3), are\ndescribed in detail in Appendix A.\n4. Results\n4.1. Qualitative Assessment\n[29] The spreading of each drifter pair was examined\nvisually, using weekly, delayed mode AVISO gridded sea\nheight anomalies [Le Traon et al., 1998] superimposed on\nthe mean dynamic height field of Rio and Hernandez [2004]\nto visualize the large\u2010scale geostrophic velocity field. The\noptimally interpolated, merged TMI\/AMSR\u2010E microwave\nsea surface temperature product generated by Remote\nSensing Systems was used to identify the location of the\nGulf Stream front.\n[30] At scales less than O(1 km), there was obvious ran-\ndom noise dominating drifter pair separation, consistent\nwith uncorrelated errors in the satellite\u2010based location fixes.\nAt larger scales, the separation of a pair was rarely mono-\ntonic, and was often characterized by extended periods of\nslow or negligible separation and shorter periods of very\nrapid separation, with occasional periods of convergence\n(decreasing separation).\n[31] At scales larger than \u223c10 km, the pairs\u2019 center of\nmass tended to follow contours of absolute sea height. Rapid\nspreading events at separation distances <10 km did not\nappear to be related to the sea height field. At larger se-\nparations, rapid spreading was rare and usually associated\nwith the pair reaching a bifurcation point in the sea height\nfield. For example, a few pairs spread to 10\u201320 km apart\nbefore reaching a saddle point between two highs in sea\nheight, then diverged rapidly as they initiated orbits around\nthese independent rings or meanders. However, at all scales\nof separation, many cases could be found where the sepa-\nration was relatively steady and not obviously influenced by\nthe geostrophic flow field.\n[32] For the first 10 days after deployment, most pairs\nseparated more slowly than the mean rate due to relatively\nrare rapid separation events. For example, 51 pairs with\ninitial separation <700 m were still transmitting 10 days\nlater: their mean separation at 10 days was 50 km, with 70%\ncloser than 50 km, 50% closer than 30 km, 17% closer than\n10 km, and one pair was closer than 1 km. In contrast, 9 of\nthese pairs (17%) were more than 100 km apart at 10 days.\nThis asymmetry diminished after 11\u201313 days, with a com-\nparable number of pairs above and below the mean sepa-\nration distance at longer times. Most of the rapid separation\nevents, but not all, occurred for pairs south of the Gulf\nStream front. There was no clear relationship between the\nlocation of the front and the location of drifter pairs that\nspent an extended time at separation less than 5 km.\n[33] Most of the drifter pairs did not exhibit sustained\nspinning or looping about their center of mass (an exception\nis noted below). Occasional inertial oscillations were evi-\ndent, as coherent anticyclonic looping of both drifters that\ndid not significantly affect the pair separation.\n[34] While space constraints prevent discussing every\npair\u2019s spreading for an array of this size, a few cases high-\nlight characteristics of pair spreading in the CLIMODE\narray: a \u201ctypical\u201d pair, i.e., one that did not exhibit unusual\nspreading behavior, a pair that exhibited rapid spreading,\nand a pair that stayed close together for an anomalously long\ntime.\n4.1.1. Typical Spreading Case\n[35] Drifters 72061 and 72072 (these are the identification\nnumbers used in the Global Drifter Program database) were\nreleased just south of the Gulf Stream front on 4 March\n2007. The pair drifted southward and began orbiting a\ncyclonic cold\u2010core ring, visible in sea height (Figure 5a).\nDuring their first 4 days, the distance between them\nincreased at approximately the mean rate, reaching \u223c10 km\nafter 4 days. This early spreading was not related to scales or\nfeatures significantly larger than the separation distance, as\nresolved by sea height or SST. From days 6\u20139 after release,\nthe drifter pair converged and diverged as the drifters orbited\nthe ring, with separation distance fluctuating between 12\nand 25 km as the drifters independently moved closer to the\nLUMPKIN AND ELIPOT: DRIFTER PAIR SPREADING C12017C12017\n7 of 20\nring center and accelerated, or further from the center and\ndecelerated. Finally, after day 9, one drifter (72072) moved\nfar enough from the ring to no longer feel its influence,\nwhile the other continued to orbit the ring. Over the next\nday, drifter 72072 moved westward, turned southward as\n72061 looped northward, and the motion of the two drifters\nbecame uncorrelated thereafter.\n4.1.2. Rapid Spreading Case\n[36] Drifters 72055 and 72056 were released as part of a\ntrio on 14 February, in the maximum surface velocity core\nof the Gulf Stream. Over the first 4.5 days, they moved at\n90\u2013110 cm s\u22121 while separating at very close to the average\nrate (Figure 5b). Starting on day 5, drifter 72055 shifted\nslightly south and slowed to a mean speed of 75 cm s\u22121\nwhile 72056, slightly to the north, continuing westward at a\nmean speed of 110 cm s\u22121. With a sustained velocity dif-\nference of 35 cm s\u22121, the separation distance rapidly\nincreased. By day 7 the drifters were 70 km apart as the\nleading (with respect to the direction of propagation) drifter\n(72056) reached a sharp southward meander in the Gulf\nStream. Their separation distance decreased to 34 km over\nthe next day as the leading drifter negotiated the bend, then\nincreased to more than 150 km (not shown in Figure 5) as\nthe leading drifter continued southward along the front\nwhile the trailing drifter encountered the meander.\n4.1.3. Inhibited Spreading Case\n[37] Drifter 72054 was released as a trio with 72061 and\n72072, discussed in the \u201ctypical spreading case\u201d above.\nHowever, this drifter and 72061 stayed extremely close\ntogether for 5.5 days (separation distance <2 km; Figure 5c).\nFrom day 5.5 to 6.5, the pair began separating at a rapid rate,\nreaching 13 km separation, but then reconverged to a sep-\naration distance often not distinguishable from zero due to\nposition fix errors. After reconverging, the drifters stayed\ncloser than 3 km together for a full 23 days, an exceptional\nand extremely anomalous case. On days 20\u201323, the sepa-\nration distance increased to \u223c2 km and the drifters could\nclearly be seen orbiting their center of mass cyclonically\n(counterclockwise), with a period of 0.87\u20130.90 days, com-\npleting three full orbits and beginning a fourth before\nreconverging to distances <1 km (Figure 6). Orbiting could\nnot be resolved when the pair was closer, due to position\nfix errors. From days 23\u201326, the drifters were closer than\n1 km. Separation distance increased again to >2 km on day\n26, this time with no rotation about their center of mass. The\ndrifters stayed \u223c2 km apart until day 30, when they abruptly\nFigure 5.

These\nsubmesoscale vortices are believed to be formed by frontal\nbaroclinic instability [Eldevik and Dysthe, 2002] or by\ninertial instability which magnifies cyclonic shear while\nweakening anticyclonic shear for large Rossby number\nflow [Shen and Evans, 2002].\n[38] This pair was exceptional in the amount of time spent\nclose together and in the clear cyclonic rotation about their\ncenter of mass. This rotation would not have been apparent\nin a lone drifter\u2019s trajectory. Other pairs exhibited briefer\nperiods of cyclonic rotation about their center of mass when\nin close proximity. This can be quantified for all pairs by\nthe Lagrangian spin, W = hu\u2032dv\u2032 \u2212 v\u2032du\u2032i\/(2Dt EKE) where\nEKE = 1\/2 hu\u20322 + v\u20322i [Griffa et al., 2008] and u\u2032, v\u2032 is the\ndrifter\u2019s motion with respect to the pair\u2019s center of mass.\nNote that by construction this calculation neglects spin\nassociated with the pair orbiting as a coherent unit around\nmesoscale features, and cannot be equated with single\u2010\nparticle spin such as in the global census of Griffa et al.\n[2008]. The average spin can be calculated as a function\nof pair separation distance, in 1 km bins, for all the\nCLIMODE drifter pairs. The result (Figure 7) shows signif-\nicant positive (cyclonic in the Northern Hemisphere) spin for\npairs separated by less than 2.5 km. Position noise, which will\naverage W = 0, has most likely reduced these values;\nregardless, this result indicates a preference for cyclonic\nvorticity in the turbulent field at scales of O(1 km).\n4.2. Quantifying Drifter Pair Spreading\n[39] Relative dispersion for the 55 CLIMODE drifter pairs\nis shown in Figure 8 in log\u2010log format. Up to 40 days after\nrelease, when the pairs reach a root\u2010mean\u2010square (rms)\nseparation of \u223c300 km, their relative dispersion in the zonal\nand meridional directions is isotropic. For rms separation\ngreater than 300 km, meridional dispersion increases line-\narly with time, indicating random walk behavior with rela-\ntive diffusivity K=2.9 \u00d7 104 m2 s\u22121. At zonal rms separation\ngreater than 500 km, the zonal dispersion increases linearly\nwith an effective relative diffusivity K=5.8 \u00d7 104 m2 s\u22121.\nThese values are equivalent to a single\u2010particle diffusivity of\n\u0001=K\/2=1.4\u20132.9 \u00d7 104 m2 s\u22121, consistent with earlier diffu-\nsivity estimates in this region [Lumpkin et al., 2002;\nZhurbas and Oh, 2004]. Because the Gulf Stream extension\nFigure 8. Zonal (heavy black solid curve) and meridional (heavy black solid dashed) dispersion of 55\nCLIMODE drifter pairs.

Thus, the\nsmaller meridional diffusivity may be most appropriate for\ncharacterizing the turbulent field at these scales [Zhurbas\nand Oh, 2004], with the transition to diffusive behavior at\n300 km indicating the scale of the largest meanders and\nrings stirring the ocean surface.\n[40] Of greater interest is the relative dispersion from the\nsmallest resolvable scales (\u223c700 m) to the 300\u2013500 km\ntransition to diffusive behavior. The relative dispersion ex-\nceeds the noise level (700 m)2 at 7 h after release. A change\nin the slope of the dispersion curve at \u223c1 day after release\n(rms separation 2.6 km), visible in log\u2010log (Figure 8) and\nsemilog (Figure 9) formats, indicates a change in the dis-\npersion regime. The early dispersion, from 7 h to 1 day, has\na slope close to unity in log\u2010log format, suggesting diffusive\nbehavior, but also appears to be a nearly straight line in\nsemilog format suggesting exponential growth. The least\nsquares fit of a diffusive curve to the observed zonal\/\nmeridional dispersion between 7 h and 1 day is Dfit\n2 =\n(36m2s\u22121)t. This fit exceeds the 95% confidence interval\nfor the first 6 h, and has an rms error of 730 m. The best\nfit of an exponential curve in the same range is Dfit\n2 =\n[(640 m)exp(1.08d\u22121t)]2, which briefly exceeds the 95%\nconfidence interval for the observed D2 at 7.5\u20139 h after\nrelease and has an rms error of 680 m. It is interesting,\nalbeit speculative, to note that an effective relative dif-\nfusivity of K \u223c 30\u201340 m2 s\u22121, consistent with our diffu-\nsive fit to D2, is approximately what one would obtain\nfrom stirring length arguments K \u223c uL applied to waves\nand swell (u \u223c 1\u20132 m s\u22121, L \u223c 10\u201330 m). Wave condi-\ntions during the February\u2013March 2007 CLIMODE cruise\nwere extreme, with breaking seas driven by 20\u201325 m\/s\nwinds common. It is possible that the drifter pairs were\nknocked about and randomly driven apart by wave\u2010driven\nStokes drift or other small\u2010scale phenomenon until their\nrms separation reached 1\u20133 km, when processes driving\nRichardson\u2019s law dispersion took over the spreading.\n[41] Exponential separation cannot explain the behavior of\nthe pairs at scales from 1\u20133 km to the first baroclinic Rossby\nradius of \u223c30 km. Instead, the observed dispersion clearly\nfollows a D2 \/ t3 relationship (Richardson\u2019s law) from\n1 day after release (rms separation 1\u20133 km) to the 40 day,\n300 km transition to diffusive behavior (Figure 8). The least\nsquares fit to the observed zonal\/meridional dispersion in\nthis range is Dfit\n2 = (3.80 \u00d7 10\u22129 m2s\u22123)t3.\n[42] While it is traditional to present dispersion in zonal\nand meridional directions, it is also valuable to examine\ndispersion in a coordinate system that follows the mean-\ndering Gulf Stream front and associated large\u2010scale features.\nFigure 9. Mean squared separation distance (sum of zonal and meridional dispersion) of 55 CLIMODE\ndrifter pairs, in semilog format (thick black curve), with 95% confidence intervals (thin black curves).\nBest fits of Richardson\u2019s law (thick gray dashed curve), exponential (thick gray solid curve), and diffusive\nbehavior (thin black curve) are repeated from Figure 8, multiplied by a factor of 2 (assuming isotropic\ndispersion).\nLUMPKIN AND ELIPOT: DRIFTER PAIR SPREADING C12017C12017\n11 of 20\nWe define a stream coordinate system using the center of\nmass of each of the drifter pairs, low passed at 2 days to\nremove inertial oscillations, fine\u2010scale features, and noise in\nposition fixes (Figures 10a and 10b). \u201cDownstream\u201d is\ndefined as the direction taken by the low\u2010passed center of\nmass, while \u201ccross stream\u201d is defined as 90\u00b0 to the left of\ndownstream. The absolute velocities of the drifters become\ndecorrelated after 8 days on average due to small\u2010scale\nfeatures in the turbulent field, but the low\u2010passed center of\nmass continues to follow the geostrophic field to lowest\norder for many more days. Relative dispersion in this\ncoordinate system is shown in Figure 10c. The pairs do not\nexhibit a significant different in downstream versus cross\u2010\nstream dispersion, arguing against the presence of shear\ndispersion which would magnify downstream dispersion\nrelative to cross stream.\n[43] Figure 11 shows the finite\u2010scale Lyapunov exponents\ncalculated from all possible CLIMODE drifter pairs, with\na = 1.15 (see Appendix A). The FSLE curve is relatively\nflat at scales smaller than 2 km, possibly indicating\nexponential separation, although this could also be caused\nby the hourly temporal resolution of the data, as the rare\nrapidly separating drifter pairs can reach O(2 km) separa-\ntion in an hour (this effect is explored in section 5 by\nresampling the data to daily resolution). In the scale range\n2\u201310 km, the FSLEs have a slope of \u22121, consistent with\nD2 \/ t2. This is slower than suggested by the relative\ndispersion (Figure 8), which has a D2 \/ t3 slope for rms\nseparations of 3\u2013300 km. The FSLE curve switches to a\nslope of \u22120.6 over the range 10\u2013250 km, close to the \u22122\/3\nslope expected for Richardson\u2019s law. At larger separations,\nthe FSLE slope is close to \u22121.3, indicating spreading at a\nrate between ballistic (slope \u22121) and diffusive (slope \u22122)\ndispersion.\n5. Discussion\n[44] The relative dispersion of the CLIMODE drifter\npairs indicate that their separation grows according to\nRichardson\u2019s law for root\u2010mean\u2010square separation distances\nFigure 10.

The FSLE curve indicates a\ntransition from slower spreading in the range 2\u201310 km,\nto Richardson\u2019s law spreading at 10\u2013250 km. The local\nfirst baroclinic Rossby radius is \u223c30 km [Chelton et al.,\n1998]. Both the relative dispersion and the FSLEs indi-\ncate that the separation from 1\u20133 km to the Rossby\nradius is not exponential.\n[45] Our results are qualitatively consistent with earlier\nfloat studies in the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Current\nregion. LaCasce and Bower [2000] found relative dispersion\nand FSLEs consistent with Richardson\u2019s law behavior for\n700 m deep isobaric floats in the Site L, North Atlantic\nCurrent and Local Dynamics experiments, at separations of\n10 km to 100\u2013200 km. This behavior is very different from\nwhat has been found in the eastern North Atlantic, where\nOllitrault et al. [2005] observed clear exponential separation\nat scales smaller than the Rossby radius for 16 float pairs at\n700 dbar (their results at submesoscale for 9 float pairs in\nthe western Atlantic were not robust, due to the small\nnumber of pairs). LaCasce and Bower [2000] also examined\nfloat pairs in the eastern North Atlantic, and found disper-\nsion weaker than Richardson\u2019s, but also noted that the\nseparation at submesoscale was not well resolved with their\ndata. At scales up to the Rossby radius, our results contrast\nwith the Gulf of Mexico drifter study of LaCasce and\nOhlmann [2003] and the Nordic Seas study of Koszalka\net al. [2009], both of whom found exponential separation\nwhile we find Richardon\u2019s law separation.\n[46] Why does pair spreading at scales from \u223c2 km to the\nlocal Rossby radius follow Richardson\u2019s law in some\nstudies, and is exponential in others? One hypothesis worth\nbriefly considering is the fact that many studies have relied\nupon chance pairs, which may bias observations toward\nregions where the surface field is convergent. Although\nearlier balloon dispersion studies [Morel and Larcheveque,\n1974; Er\u2010el and Peskin, 1981] did not find a statistical\ndifference between chance and original pairs, LaCasce and\nOhlmann [2003] speculated that this might affect their\nresults but could not quantify the effect with their data\nset. However, this hypothesis seems unlikely to explain\nthe disparate results of the float and drifter studies in the\nAtlantic at the submesoscale: both this study and Ollitrault\net al. [2005] rely on original pairs, with Richardson\u2019s\nseparation found here and Ollitrault et al. [2005] finding\nexponential separation. LaCasce and Bower [2000] and\nLaCasce and Ohlmann [2003] relied on chance pairs and\nfound Richardon\u2019s law and exponential separation,\nrespectively.\n[47] We can test the impact of chance pairs versus original\npairs in the Gulf Stream region by calculating the dispersion\nand FSLEs for the chance drifter pairs in the region. The\nresults (Figure 12) have large error bars for relative dis-\npersion, because of the small number of chance drifter pairs\nwith initial separation distance of 700 m or less (nine\npairs). Within these large error bars, the relative dispersion\ncan accommodate an exponential growth or a D2 \/ t3\nRichardson\u2019s law growth at scales from 1\u20133 km to the\nlocal Rossby radius. However, only the Richardson\u2019s law\ncurve fits a broader range of scales, out to the \u223c300 km\ntransition to diffusive behavior. The FSLEs (calculated\nwith a = 1.5) have nearly the same slopes as for the\nCLIMODE drifters (Figure 11), although they tend to be\nslightly smaller in magnitude. Because the relative dis-\npersion and FSLEs for the chance pair drifters are nearly\nidentical to those of the CLIMODE drifters within the\nconfidence intervals, we conclude that these calculations\nare not contaminated by the inhomogeneous sampling of\nchance pairs, at least in the Gulf Stream region.\nFigure 11. Finite\u2010scale Lyapunov exponents calculated from all possible CLIMODE drifter pairs. The\nlocal first baroclinic Rossby radius is indicated by a vertical gray line.\nLUMPKIN AND ELIPOT: DRIFTER PAIR SPREADING C12017C12017\n13 of 20\n[48] A second hypothesis for the discrepancy in the sub-\nmesoscale dispersion from the various drifter and float\nstudies is that regional differences in dynamics are associ-\nated with qualitatively different dispersion regimes at the\nsubmesoscale. For example, the Gulf of Mexico drifters of\nLaCasce and Ohlmann [2003] were in a region of relatively\nweak surface fronts north of the Loop Current and in the far\nnorthwestern Gulf. The CLIMODE drifters, in contrast,\nwere on or near the extremely energetic Gulf Stream front in\nthe presence of intense wind forcing, conditions that can\nlead to frontogenesis of submesoscale vortices [Thomas\net al., 2008]. As noted earlier, pair dispersion following\nRichardson\u2019s law at separation greater than 1\u20133 km in-\ndicates the presence of energetic eddies at this scale, far\nsmaller than the local first baroclinic Rossby radius of\n\u223c30 km. Submesoscale coherent vortices [McWilliams,\n1985] of O(1 km) radius were directly observed in Sea-\nSoar measurements during the CLIMODE cruise (T.\nJoyce and L. Thomas, personal communication, 2007),\nand in a few drifter trajectories (e.g., Figure 6). Perhaps\nthe presence of energetic features at the scales of these\nvortices in the Gulf Stream region, and and their absence\nin more quiescent parts of the ocean, could account for\nthe discrepancy between our results and those of LaCasce\nand Ohlmann [2003]. This result is consistent with the\nmodeling studies of Isern\u2010Fontanet et al. [2006] and\nLapeyre [2009], who found that the surface mode of SQG\ntheory (with its relatively flat wave number spectrum)\ndominates the flow in regions with large\u2010mesoscale\nenergy and in regions with deep mixed layers. In contrast,\nthe interior baroclinic mode (described by QG theory)\ndominates the surface in less energetic regions such as the\nGulf of Mexico, although those studies did not extend to\nthe Gulf. It is interesting to note, however, that the 700 m\ndeep floats in the western North Atlantic examined by\nLaCasce and Bower [2000] also demonstrated Richard-\nson\u2019s law dispersion at scales smaller than the local\nRossby radius. This is deeper than the surface\u2010trapped\nmode of SQG, and demands an alternative explanation.\n[49] We test the hypothesis of regional dependence with\nthe ADB drifters deployed in the eastern subtropical\nAtlantic. We do not argue that the submesoscale energy in\nthe eastern subtropical North Atlantic is comparable to that\nof the northern and western Gulf of Mexico, but merely that\nthese regions may be qualitatively different from the Gulf\nStream front.\n[50] The relative dispersion and FSLE curves for the ADB\ndrifters are shown in Figure 13. The dispersion is slower\nthan observed in the CLIMODE array, and the local Rossby\ndeformation radius is larger (40 km) [Chelton et al., 1998].\nFigure 12.

At lags greater than \u223c30 days, the dispersion in both\nzonal and meridional directions grows approximately line-\narly with time, consistent with a single\u2010particle diffusion of\n\u0001=1.7 \u00d7 103 m2 s\u22121, nearly an order of magnitude lower than\nin the CLIMODE region. A discontinuity in the dispersion\noccurs at 4\u20136 days after release, when several of the\nADB drifters failed and the data abruptly became more\nsparse (from 18 pairs to 15 pairs). A least squares fit of a\nRichardson\u2019s law curve to the observed zonal\/meridional\ndispersion in the range 1\u201315 days (Figure 13) isDfit\n2 = (1.49 \u00d7\n10\u221210 m2s\u22123) \u00d7 t3. This fit exceeds the 95% confidence\nestimate of D2 between the discontinuity at 5 and 10\ndays, and below the confidence interval on days 1\u20132.5. It\nhas an rms error of 5.7 km. A best fit of an exponential\nin the 1\u201315 day range is Dfit\n2 = [(880m)exp(0.21d\u22121t)]2.\nThis fit exceeds the confidence interval from 5 days to\n8.5 days, and has an rms error of 4.0 km. Given the\nlarge error bars on the observed dispersion, it is difficult\nto conclusively discriminate between Richardson\u2019s law\nand exponential dispersive behavior in this range, although\nexponential growth fits the observations (Figure 13) better.\n[51] The FSLEs for the ADB drifters (Figure 13c), cal-\nculated using a = 1.5, are close to the CLIMODE results at\nscales smaller than a few kilometers, but drop off more\nquickly in the range 3\u20135 km with a slope of \u22122 to \u22123.\nBetween 4 and 6 km, the FSLEs switch to a \u22122\/3 slope that\npersists to at least 350 km separation. Beyond 350 km, the\nFSLEs may drop off more quickly again, consistent with\ndiffusive behavior, but this is not robust. The \u22122\/3 slope in\nthe FSLEs indicates Richardson\u2019s law dispersion in this\nscale range, inconsistent with exponential separation (con-\nstant FSLEs). More observations are available for calcu-\nlating the FSLEs than for relative dispersion from an initial\nseparation distance < 700 m. For example, at 10 days lag,\nwhen the rms separation of the ADB pairs was 10 km,\n14 pairs remained for calculating relative dispersion. For\nthe FSLE calculation, there were 31 cases where ADB\npairs separated from 9.9 km to 11.4 km (the [dn, dn+1]\nbin bracketing 10 km). Thus, in the eastern subtropical\nAtlantic, the relative dispersion suggests exponential\nspreading at scales smaller than the Rossby radius, while the\nFSLE results indicate that it is not exponential at scales\nfrom O(1 km) to the deformation radius. Obviously, any\nconclusions must be more tentative for the ADB drifters\nFigure 13.

In 2003, the Argos network provided a maximum\nof 6\u20138 fixes per day, and periods with only a few fixes per\nday were not uncommon [Elipot and Lumpkin, 2008]. We\ncan examine this effect on our data by subsampling the\nCLIMODE data to daily resolution and recalculating the\npair spreading. The results are shown in Figure 14: sub-\nsampling alters the resolution of the relative dispersion\ncurves, but not their slopes. However, subsampling has a\nprofound effect on the FSLE results: the curve is flattened\nsignificantly [LaCasce, 2008] at separation distances smal-\nler than 50 km. The slope doesn\u2019t become perfectly flat at\nthese scales, but the slope of \u22120.35 to \u22120.4 spuriously in-\ndicates dispersion far faster than the fastest \u201cnormal\u201d power\nlaw dispersion (Richardson\u2019s law, with an FSLE slope\nof \u22122\/3).\n[53] These results from the subsampled CLIMODE data\nsuggest that the FSLE values of LaCasce and Ohlmann\n[2003] were contaminated by the temporal resolution of\nthose data at scales smaller than a threshold dmin. If the\ntemporal resolution of the data is dt, there will be a small but\nsignificant fraction of pairs that separate at a speed vmax\nwhich sets dmin = dt \u00b7 vmax. Our results for the sub-\nsampled CLIMODE drifters indicate that vmax = (50 km)\/\n(1day) \u223c 50 cm s\u22121. As noted earlier, there were a small\nnumber of cases (<1%) where CLIMODE pairs separated\nat this speed. This implies that our FSLE curve for full\u2010\nresolution (hourly) data is suspect at scales smaller than\n\u223c2 km.\n6. Conclusions\n[54] In this study, we have examined the relative disper-\nsion and finite\u2010scale Lyapunov exponents of drifter pairs in\nthe CLIMODE array, and some other recent drifter pairs in\nthe North Atlantic. The CLIMODE drifters and chance\ndrifter pairs in the Gulf Stream region exhibit Richardson\u2019s\nlaw relative dispersion from 1\u20133 km to 300\u2013500 km, the\nscale of the largest rings and meanders, beyond which their\ndispersion is consistent with a single\u2010particle constant\neffective diffusivity of O(1\u20132 \u00d7 104 m2 s\u22121). Drifters in the\neastern subtropical North Atlantic spread more slowly.\nFSLEs in this region indicate Richardson\u2019s law spreading at\nsubdeformation length scales, but the relative dispersion is\nmore consistent with exponential spreading, yet are more\nnoisy. The long\u2010term effective diffusivity in this region is\nsmaller by an order of magnitude than in the Gulf Stream.\nFigure 14.

The local first baroclinic Rossby radius is indicated by a vertical gray line; the other\ngray lines indicate values and slopes of the hourly resolution CLIMODE drifter pairs (Figure 11) for\nreference.\nLUMPKIN AND ELIPOT: DRIFTER PAIR SPREADING C12017C12017\n16 of 20\n[55] For separation scales larger than the local deforma-\ntion radius our results are consistent with numerous previous\ndrifter and float studies, indicating an energy cascade up to\nthe scale of the largest eddies, then a transition at larger\nseparations to random walk behavior characterized by a\nconstant effective diffusivity.\n[56] In the scale range from 1\u20133 km to the local defor-\nmation radius of \u223c30 km, our results indicate that the\nvelocity wave number spectrum in the Gulf Stream region is\nflatter than the k\u22123 slope predicted for the enstrophy cascade\nsubrange of 2\u2010D quasigeostrophic turbulence [Kraichnan,\n1967; Charney, 1971]. A k\u22123 slope would produce expo-\nnential pair separation [Bennett, 1984] and constant FSLEs.\nOur results indicate local (nonexponential) spreading in this\nscale range, consistent with a flatter wave number spectrum.\nShear dispersion could produce Richardson\u2019s law\u2010like rel-\native dispersion in the direction parallel to the sheared flow\n[Bennett, 1987], but also produces weaker dispersion in the\ncross\u2010flow direction. In contrast, we find isotropic spreading\nin the 2\u201330 km scale range, in both geographic and stream\ncoordinates, inconsistent with shear dispersion.\n[57] The presence of a rich and energetic submesoscale\nfield has been documented in several recent high\u2010resolution\nsimulation studies [Klein et al., 2008; Capet et al., 2008], in\nwhich the energy of the submesoscale increases dramatically\nwhen the simulation resolution approaches O(1 km). Sub-\nmesoscale coherent vortices (SCVs) [see McWilliams, 1985]\nat the ocean surface are generated by frontal baroclinic\ninstability [Eldevik and Dysthe, 2002] or inertial instability\n[Shen and Evans, 2002]. The presence of an energetic\nsubmesoscale field, with O(1) Rossby and Richardson\nnumbers with vertical velocities an order of magnitude\nlarger than the mesoscale field, has significant impact on\nthe structure of the mixed layer [Thomas et al., 2008].\nObservations [Munk et al., 2000; Rudnick, 2001; Griffa\net al., 2008], simulations [Klein et al., 2008], and theory\n[Shen and Evans, 2002; Klein et al., 2003] suggest that SCVs\nat the ocean surface are predominantly cyclonic, a result\nconsistent with the spin of the CLIMODE drifter pairs about\ntheir center of mass at separation distances smaller than\n2.5 km (Figure 7).\n[58] Surface quasigeostrophic (SQG) theory predicts a\nshallower wave number spectrum than in 2\u2010D geostrophic\nturbulence at scales smaller than the Rossby radius, con-\nsistent with the Gulf Stream CLIMODE drifters. Because\nSQG assumes that the surface velocity field is completely\ndriven by surface density variations, it predicts that sea\nheight and surface density (or its measured proxy, SST) are\nstrongly correlated and thus surface currents can be calcu-\nlated from snapshots of SST [Isern\u2010Fontanet et al., 2006]\nwhere SQG applies. Recently, Isern\u2010Fontanet et al. [2008]\nexploited this relationship to calculate surface currents\nfrom SST in a fully eddy\u2010resolving numerical simulation of\nthe North Atlantic. They found that the SQG approach was\nable to accurately estimate the model\u2019s currents in regions\nwhere the vorticity was large (although not so large that\nnonlinear terms became important), and where SST varia-\ntions followed density variations at the base of the mixed\nlayer. This latter condition was met in regions with strong\nwinds, and in regions with deep mixed layers including the\nSargasso Sea where winds are relatively weak. They\nmapped the skill of the SQG approach between 32 and 48\u00b0N\n(their Figure 5), and demonstrated that it works well over\nmuch of the CLIMODE study region, except over the Grand\nBanks characterized by shallow mixed layers. Although\ntheir study did not extend to the Gulf of Mexico, their results\nand the generally shallower mixed layers of the Gulf suggest\nthat SQG may not be as relevant for surface drifters in that\nregion. In another study of an eddy\u2010resolving simulation of\nthe North Atlantic, Lapeyre [2009] found that the surface\nmode of SQG theory dominates the flow in regions of\nintense mesoscale activity (such as the CLIMODE study\nregion) while the interior first baroclinic mode, with its\nassociated steeper wave number spectrum at the sub-\nmesoscale, dominates in relatively quiescent regions such as\nthe northern Gulf of Mexico or the eastern subtropical North\nAtlantic.\n[59] While SQG theory is fully consistent with the results\nof this study, there are some significant questions which\nremain regarding its ability to explain the full suite of earlier\nstudies. It is not necessarily inconsistent with surface drifters\nin the Gulf of Mexico [LaCasce and Ohlmann, 2003]\ndemonstrating exponential separation at submesoscales due\nto the regional differences discussed earlier. Similarly, it is\nnot inconsistent with exponential dispersion of subsurface\nfloats [Ollitrault et al., 2005] in the submesoscale range\nbecause those observations were beneath the O(250 m) thick\nsurface boundary layer and in the less energetic eastern\nNorth Atlantic. However, SQG cannot account for sub-\nmesoscale Richardson\u2019s law\u2010like dispersion of 700 m deep\nfloats in the Gulf Stream region [LaCasce and Bower,\n2000], which should be well beneath the influence of the\nsurface\u2010trapped mode. In addition, the Nordic Seas drifters\nof Koszalka et al. [2009] demonstrated exponential separa-\ntion at scales smaller than the local Rossby radius, in a\nregion of substantial eddy kinetic energy and deep mixed\nlayers, although this exponential separation was observed\nonly over the first 2 days after release; it is plausible that\ntheir 25 h window filtering and 6 h subsampling may have\nimpacted the submesoscale energy in their observations. In a\nrecent study of velocity and temperature spectra across the\nGulf Stream measured by repeat ADCP sections from the\nOleander Project, Wang et al. [2010] found a k\u22123 spectral\nslope from \u223c20 km to \u223c200 km at depths of 30\u201390 m. This\nresult is consistent with the enstrophy cascade of 2\u2010D QG\nturbulence, but should yield exponential separation of par-\nticle pairs across the full mesoscale range to the largest\nenergy\u2010containing rings and meanders. Clearly the stark\ncontrast between the results of Wang et al. [2010] and this\nstudy is startling, and the relevance of SQG in the western\nNorth Atlantic remains subject to reevaluation in future\nanalyses of observations.\n[60] At separation distances less than 1 km, pair spreading\nmay be dominated by the larger submesoscale vortices, and\nin principle one would expect the relative dispersion to be\nnonlocal (exponential). The slope of the CLIMODE drifters\u2019\nrelative dispersion at rms separation from 800 m to 2 km is\nconsistent with exponential separation (Figure 9), and we\nfind a constant value for the FSLEs at these small separation\ndistances. It is tempting to interpret these results as consis-\ntent with nonlocal spreading driven by coherent sub-\nmesoscale vortices. However, as noted earlier, the relative\ndispersion can also be explained by a constant diffusivity in\nthis range, and it is at these small scales that the hourly\nLUMPKIN AND ELIPOT: DRIFTER PAIR SPREADING C12017C12017\n17 of 20\nresolution of our data may contaminate our FSLE results.\nThus, higher temporal resolution data are necessary to\nevaluate pair spreading at scales below approximately 2 km.\n[61] Finally, it is important to note that this study\u2019s con-\nclusions do not imply that tracer spreading is not expo-\nnential. In local dispersion, when the stirring is dominated\nby eddies of the same scale as a tracer cloud, the cloud\nbecomes highly convoluted, the length of the cloud can be\nstretched exponentially, while its end points (and particle\npair separation) follows Richardson\u2019s law [Bennett, 1984].\nIn contrast, in nonlocal dispersion, stirring is dominated by\nmuch larger eddies. The tracer cloud is then drawn into a\nfew long streaks, and pair separation is exponential\n[Bennett, 1984]. Thus, there is no qualitative inconsistency\nbetween this study\u2019s results and recent studies indicating\nexponential stretching of the length of a tracer cloud at\nthe ocean surface [Beron\u2010Vera et al., 2008; Waugh and\nAbraham, 2008]. However, many recent studies such as\nthese rely upon eddy velocity fields derived from the\nAVISO product [Le Traon et al., 1998], which does not\ncontain significant energy at scales smaller than \u223c200 km.\nThe apparently ubiquitous presence of an energetic sub-\nmesoscale field at the ocean surface may elevate initial\ntracer spreading rates substantially above the rates calcu-\nlated in those studies.\nAppendix A: Details of Calculating Finite\u2010Scale\nLyapunov Exponents\n[62] Finite\u2010scale Lyapunov exponents can be sensitive to\nthe temporal spacing of the data at small separation dis-\ntances [LaCasce, 2008], for which the time interval Dt\napproaches the resolution of the data for some pairs. In this\nstudy, we attempt to ameliorate this issue by calculating\nthe times corresponding to dn via linear interpolation\nbetween the closest hourly values bracketing dn (A. Haza,\npersonal communication, 2009). For example, if a pair\ngoes from d = 1 km to d = 1.4 km in 1 h (the temporal\nresolution of our data), and we seek a Dt for the transition\nfrom dn = 1 km to dn+1 = 1.2 km, we would derive Dt =\n0.5 h. For the CLIMODE drifter pairs, the separation\nspeed from the center of mass was less than 50 cm s\u22121 for\n99.3% of the hourly observations; a rare 50 cm s\u22121 sep-\naration over 1 h translates to a spatial scale of 1.8 km, so\nour FSLE values at smaller scales may be contaminated by\nthe temporal resolution of the data. This temporal sam-\npling limit affects not only the lowest value of l that can\nbe resolved, but also the minimum value of a that can be\nchosen [Haza et al., 2008]. Lower values of a provide\ndenser resolution of the FSLEs as a function of d, but\nbelow a data\u2010dependent threshold the values and slopes of\nthe FSLEs will be affected for small separations. In this\nstudy, we followed the approach of Haza et al. [2008] by\ncalculating the FSLEs for decreasing values of a (2, 1.75,\n1.5, 1.25, 1.15), chosing the smallest value (and thus the\nhighest resolution in d space) that does not contaminate\nthe results when compared to those from larger values. We\nfound that this minimum a depended upon the data den-\nsity: for the dense CLIMODE array, the FSLEs for a =\n1.15 agreed nearly perfectly with the coarser results from\nlarger values. However, for the sparse ADB data set,\nvalues smaller than a = 1.5 altered the slope of the\nFSLEs at d < 30 km by spuriously increasing the values\nof l at smaller scales.\n[63] Another less severe drawback to the FSLE approach is\nthat the separation distance of a pair often does not grow\nFigure A1. Plot of separation distance versus time since deployment for one of the CLIMODE\ndrifter pairs. Suppose the FSLE ln is calculated over the interval [dn = 10 km, dn+1 = 15 km].\nThe first crossing method would identify the circled intersections connected by a dashed line, with\nan interval Dtn = 2.22 days. The fastest crossing method would identify two crossings indicated\nby the diamond intersections connected by heavy black lines, with intervals of 0.43 and 0.25 days.\nLUMPKIN AND ELIPOT: DRIFTER PAIR SPREADING C12017C12017\n18 of 20\nmonotonically across an interval [dn, dn+1], and there is not a\nconsensus on how to choose Dt values in these cases. Some\nresearchers (J. LaCasce, personal communication, 2009)\nchoose the time of the first crossing of dn and of dn+1 for each\npair, so that there is one value of Dt (and thus of l) per pair,\nper distance bin (see Figure A1). Others (A. Haza and\nT. \u00d6zg\u00f6kmen, personal communication, 2009) choose the\nfastest possible transitions from dn to dn+1 (Figure A1). With\nthis approach, if the pair separation crosses dn multiple times\nbefore subsequently crossing dn+1, only the time of the final\ncrossing of dn is used. In the fastest approach algorithm,\nmultiple values may be derived for a pair, if it crossed from dn\nto dn+1 multiple times. These two algorithms produce iden-\ntical results for pairs which monotonically increase from dn to\ndn+1. In practice, we found that these two algorithms produce\nsimilar results: l was consistently, albeit slightly, smaller by\n\u223c 0.88 across all values of d when using the first crossing\nalgorithm, and the slope of l versus d in a log\u2010log plot was not\nsensitive to the choice of crossing algorithm. Note that this\nlack of sensitivity is true for h1\/Dtni, the ensemble average\nused to calculate the FSLEs, but not for the ensemble average\n1\/hDtni. The first crossing algorithm yields aDtn distribution\nwith more outliers at large values, compared to the fastest\ncrossing algorithm. These large outliers are caused by the\nsmall number of pairs that spend an extended time crossing\nand recrossing dn before reaching dn+1. They significantly\nincrease the mean value hDtni calculated via the first crossing\nalgorithm, particularly at small values of d. In contrast, the\nfastest crossing algorithm produces many more estimates of\nDtn, and thus better resolves the distribution in a d bin. As a\nconsequence, the fastest crossing algorithm is far less sensi-\ntive to the distinction between h1\/Dtni and 1\/hDtni.\n[64] In this study we used the fastest crossing algorithm\nfor our FSLE calculations because it provides more de-\ngrees of freedom than the first crossing approach. We\ndetermined 95% confidence intervals for ln by bootstrap\nresampling the Dt values from all of the pairs in a given\nseparation bin [dn, dn+1].\n[65] Acknowledgments.
