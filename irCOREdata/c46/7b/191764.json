The outcome of \npatients post myocardial infarction has improved somewhat due to advances in \nmedical therapy, however the associated morbidity and mortality remains the same. \nClinical features may be useful for predicting patients who are at risk of developing \nsuch complications post AMI but lack sensitivity and specificity. Biomarkers are \nemerging as a useful tool in predicting prognosis in patients after an AMI. B type \nnatriuretic peptide and its more stable counterpart N terminal pro B type natriuretic \npeptide (NT-proBNP) have shown some promise in this area and are able to predict \ndeath or heart failure.1 Newer peptides are emerging which may be of some use, \nparticularly in a multi-marker strategy with NT-proBNP.  \nCardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) is a 201 amino-acid inflammatory cytokine, which belongs to \nthe interleukin-6 family. 2 CT-1 induces cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, 3 adding \nsarcomeres in series rather than in parallel and leading to increased cardiac myocyte \nsize due to an increase in cell length, with little change in width. 4 It binds to the \nglycoprotein 130 (gp130) and leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor. 5 The actions of \nCT-1 are dependent on receptor binding but it has been shown to have protective \neffects on adult rat or human cardiomyocytes when added prior to ischaemia and at \nreperfusion.6, 7 When given to rats it causes a decline in blood pressure and a reflex \nincrease in heart rate. 8 CT-1 has been shown to be raised in patients following an \nAMI and unstable angina 9,10 and in those patients with echocardiographic heart \nfailure compared to controls. 11 Most recently CT-1 has been shown to be raised in \nhypertension. 12,13 It is unclear however whether CT-1 has a protective or detrimental \neffect in AMI as it triggers hypertrophy and anti-apoptotic pathways by distinct \nmechanisms. The role of CT-1 in the prognostication of AMI is unknown. In this \n 3\nstudy we investigated whether CT-1 would be of benefit in determining the prognosis \nof AMI particularly death and heart failure which remain a leading cause of mortality \nand morbidity. We compared this with N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-\nproBNP), which has been shown to be of prognostic benefit in this group of patients. \n1,14,15  \n \nMethods \nStudy population \nWe studied 291 consecutive acute myocardial infarction patients admitted to the \nCoronary Care Unit of Leicester Royal Infirmary. The study complied with the \nDeclaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethics committee; written \ninformed consent was obtained from patients. AMI was defined at presentation with \nat least two of three standard criteria, i.e. appropriate symptoms, acute ECG changes \nof infarction (ST elevation or depression, new left bundle branch block) and a rise in \ntroponin T above the 99th centile for our population. AMI was sub categorised into ST \nsegment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or non-ST segment myocardial \ninfarction (NSTEMI). Primary treatment for STEMI in our institution is thrombolytic \ntherapy and was administered by the attending physician if the patient presented \nwithin 12 hours of symptom onset. Exclusion criteria were known malignancy, or \nsurgery in the previous month.  Control subjects (n=47) were age and gender matched \nand recruited from University of Leicester and had peptide measurements made on \none occasion. \n \n \n \n 4\nPlasma samples \nBlood measurement was made at 25-48hrs after the onset of chest pain for \ndetermination of plasma CT-1 and NT-proBNP. After 15 minutes bed rest, 20mL \nblood was collected into tubes containing EDTA and aprotinin. All plasma was stored \nat -70\u00b0C until assayed in a single batch.  \n \nEchocardiography \nTransthoracic echocardiography was performed in patients using a Sonos 5500 \ninstrument (Philips Medical Systems, Reigate, UK). A 16-segment left ventricular \nwall motion index (LVWMI) based on the American Society of Echocardiography \nmode was derived by scoring each LV segment (1=normal, 2=hypokinesis, 3=akinesis \nand 4=dyskinesis (Paradoxical Motion), and dividing the total by the number of \nsegments scored. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated using the \nbiplane method of discs formula. 16 Inter and intra coefficients of variation were 9.3% \nand 11.4% respectively. \n \nNT-proBNP assay \nOur NT-proBNP assay was based on a non-competitive assay. Sheep antibodies were \nraised to the N-terminal of human NT-proBNP and monoclonal mouse antibodies \nwere raised to the C- terminal. The N-terminal IgG was affinity-purified and \nbiotinylated. Samples or NT-proBNP standards were incubated in C-terminal IgG\u2013\ncoated wells with the biotinylated N-terminal antibody for 24 hours at 4\u00b0C. Detection \nwas with methyl-acridinium ester (MAE)\u2013labelled streptavidin. 17 The lower limit of \ndetection was 0.3 fmol\/ml. Inter and intra coefficients of variation were 2.3% and \n 5\n4.8% respectively. There was no cross reactivity with atrial natriuretic peptide, BNP, \nor C-type natriuretic peptide. \n \nCT-1 assay \nThe CT-1 assay was based on a non-competitive assay. ELISA plates were coated \nwith anti-rabbit IgG (100ng\/well). The capture antibody was a rabbit anti-CT-1 \nantibody (100ng\/100\u03bcL assay buffer, Peprotech Inc, Rocky Hill, NJ), and detection \nemployed a biotinylated mouse monoclonal antibody (50ng\/100\u03bcL assay buffer, \nBioVendor Laboratory Medicine, Modrice, Czech Republic). Plasma samples (50 \u03bcL) \nor CT-1 standards were incubated for 24 hours at 4\u00b0C. Following washes; detection \nwas performed using methyl-acridinium ester (MAE)\u2013labelled streptavidin. Intra- and \ninter- assay coefficients of variation were found to be less than 10%. \n \nEnd points \nWe assessed the value of both CT-1 and NT-proBNP for the prediction of death or \nheart failure. A combined primary endpoint consisting of death and rehospitalization \nfor heart failure was used. Hospitalization for heart failure was defined as a hospital \nadmission for which heart failure was the primary reason and was verified by \ncontacting each patient and review of their notes. Death endpoints were obtained by \nreviewing the Office of National Statistics Registry which records all hospital deaths. \nThere was a minimum 30-day follow-up of all patients. \n \nStatistical analysis \nStatistical analyses were performed on SPSS Version 12 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, \nIllinois). The continuous variables in the two independent groups were compared \n 6\nusing the Mann Whitney U test and results for continuous variables are displayed as \nmedian (range). Endpoints were analysed as categorical for CT-1 and NT-proBNP. \nSpearman\u2019s correlations were performed and binary logistic regression analyses were \nconducted which included baseline patient characteristics (age, sex, serum creatinine, \nKillip class, territory of AMI and whether the patient received thrombolysis or not) \nand peptide markers (including troponin I), to test the independent predictive power \nof the peptides above and below the median for death or heart failure as defined \nabove. NT-proBNP and CT-1 were normalised by log transformation. Thus, odds \nratios and hazard ratios refer to a tenfold rise in the levels of these markers. To \nidentify the independent predictors of death or heart failure, Cox proportional hazard \nanalyses was used. Kaplan Meier survival curves were generated to visualise the \nrelationship between the peptides NT-proBNP and CT-1 and the primary endpoint as \ntime to first event. To compare the predictive value of NT-proBNP and CT-1, \nreceiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated at 438 days and the \narea under the curves (AUC) was calculated. A p value of less than 0.05 was deemed \nto be statistically significant. Power calculations showed that for a 2.5 fold difference \nin CT-1 values between those with the primary endpoint and the event free group, the \nnumber of patients needed was 266 to detect a difference with a power of 90% at \np<0.05.  \n \nResults \nPatient characteristics \nThe demographic features of the patient population are shown in Table 1. Median \nlength of follow-up was 336 days with a range of 0\u2013645 days. Of the patients \nenrolled, 153 (52.6 %) received thrombolysis during the index admission. No patient \n 7\nwas lost to follow-up. During follow-up, 27 (9.3%) patients died and 19 (6.5%) were \nreadmitted with heart failure. Echocardiographic data was available for 252 (86.6%) \nof the 291 patients and done at median of 3.5 days (range 2-5) after presentation with \nAMI. 22 echocardiograms were not analysable and 17 patients did not receive an \nechocardiogram. A subset of 50 patients had daily samples taken to determine the \nsecretion profile of the respective peptides. The cohort was randomly selected and \nthere was no identifiable significant differences noted in this group compared to the \nmain group in terms of age, sex, PMH, location of infarct or LVWMI. \n \nCT-1 levels in patients and controls \nPlasma levels of CT-1 in patients with AMI ranged from 0.03- 453.3fmol\/ml with a \nmedian of 0.77fmol\/ml. CT-1 was higher in patients following AMI compared to \ncontrol subjects (median [range] fmol\/ml 0.77[0.03-457.1] vs. 0.73[0.20-1.78], \np=0.001). CT-1 was significantly higher in patients who died (median [range] fmol\/ml \n0.88[0.2\u2013294.1] vs. 0.70[0.03\u2013 453.3], p=0.05). The time course of secretion of CT-1 \nwas measured daily in a subset of 50 patients revealing a significant overall difference \nin secretion over the 5 days (p<0.0001). There was also a significant difference in \nsecretion when day 1 was compared to days 2, 3 and 4 (p<0.0001) and is shown in \nfigure 1. \nThere was no correlation of CT-1 with age (r= 0.07, p= 0.228), LVWMI (r= -0.042, \np= 0.507) or heart failure (r= 0.064, p> 0.346).  CT-1 did not differ significantly \naccording to gender, smoking status, the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus, \nhypertension, previous MI diagnosis, hypercholesterolemia or whether a patient \nreceived thrombolyis or not. There was no correlation however between NT-proBNP \nand CT-1 (r=0.087, p=0.138). \n 8\nNT-proBNP levels in patients and controls \nNT-proBNP was significantly elevated in AMI compared with controls (Median \n[Range], fmol\/ml, 1459.9[0.3\u201311906.5] vs. 10.1[0.3\u2013 134.4], p<0.0001) and was \nsignificantly higher in patients who died (median [range] fmol\/ml 6727.2[20.1\u2013\n11906.5] vs. 1228.3[0.30\u2013 10800.14], p<0.001) or were readmitted with heart failure \n(median [range] fmol\/ml 4678.15[353.47 \u2013 10712.99] vs. 1367.47[0.3\u201311906.47], \np=0.012). The time course of secretion of NT-proBNP revealed a significant overall \ndifference in secretion over 5 days (p<0.0001) in a 50 patient sample and is shown in \nfigure 2. \n \nRelationship between CT-1 and echocardiographic parameters \nFor the whole population, mean LVWMI was 1.52 (range 1.08-2.75) and EF was 38% \n(range 12-49%). The LVWMI score in those subjects with anterior AMI was higher \nthan in those with inferior AMI (median [range] fmol\/ml 1.7 [1.08-2.75] vs. 1.4 [1.00-\n2.60], p<0.0001). However LVEF was no different between the two groups (median \n[range] fmol\/ml 39 [12-68] vs. 40 [13-65]) %, p=0.45). There was a weak correlation \nof CT-1 with LVWMI (r= 0.125, p= 0.049). NT-proBNP also correlated positively \nwith LVWMI (r=0.35, p<0.0001) and negatively with the EF (r= -0.30, p<0.0001). \n \nCT-1 and NT-proBNP as predictors of death or heart failure \nCT-1 was raised in patients with death or heart failure compared to survivors (median \n[range] fmol\/ml, 0.9[0.05-392.2] vs. 0.67[0.03-453.3], p=0.019). There was no \nsignificant difference in CT-1 between patients who died or were readmitted with \nheart failure (median [range] fmol\/ml, 0.88[0.2\u2013294.1] vs. 0.93[0.05-389.0], p=NS). \n 9\nWhen clinical and demographic characteristics were entered into a multivariate binary \nlogistic model CT-1 (OR 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1-3.2, p=0.031) and NT-proBNP (OR 2.4, \n95% CI: 1.1-5.2, p=0.026) independently predicted the primary endpoint. This was \nalso confirmed on the Cox proportional hazards model with the independent \npredictors of death or heart failure being CT-1 (HR 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1-2.0, p=0.034) \nand NT-proBNP (HR 2.1, 95% CI: 1.0-4.3, p=0.05) \nThe Kaplan-Meier survival curve revealed a significantly better clinical outcome in \npatients with CT-1 below the median compared with those with CT-1 above the \nmedian (log rank 5.79, p=0.016, figure 3).  This was also true for NT-proBNP (log \nrank 20.24, p<0.0001, figure 4). The receiver-operating curve for CT-1 yielded an \narea under the curve (AUC) of 0.62 (95% CI: 0.53-0.70, p=0.017); for NT-proBNP \nthe AUC was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.69-0.86, p<0.001).  The logistic model combining the 2 \nmarkers (predicted probability) yielded an AUC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.78-0.91, \np<0.001), which exceeded that of either peptide alone (figure 5). \n \nDiscussion \nReperfusion therapy has improved mortality post MI, however the outcome of \npatients despite this is still poor; 18 for this reason risk stratification remains important \nand may be useful in helping to select treatment regimes in the future. A multimarker \nstrategy has benefits in that it utilizes the different pathways that are involved in the \ndevelopment and outcome of an AMI in the hope that complementary information can \nbe gained. 19 The aim of this study was to assess the utility of CT-1 and NT-proBNP \nin determining the prognosis of AMI patients. The results of this study confirm the \nindependent prognostic values of early CT-1 and NT-proBNP levels in determining \ndeath or heart failure in patients who have an AMI. The information has been gained \n 10\nwith a single blood test taken between 25-48 hours. Unlike NT-proBNP there was no \ncorrelation of CT-1 with age or sex, which may make it a more discerning marker. \nThe predictive value of CT-1 provides risk prediction independent of NT-proBNP and \nother known clinical predictors of death or heart failure. Both CT-1 and NT-proBNP \nare raised after an AMI and their secretion patterns differ over the 5 days following an \nAMI with significant differences noted for both peptides. CT-1 is raised early after an \nAMI with levels falling rapidly after the first 24 hours then rising again. This suggests \nthat there may be a stored pool of CT-1, which is released after an AMI, with the \nsecond wave of release due to new synthesis of the peptide. The likely source of CT-1 \nis unknown however a possible source is the left ventricle. We have shown a weak but \npositive correlation between CT-1 and LVWMI.  Other possible sources could well be \nthe atria; CT-1 has been shown to be raised in the atrial tissue of WKY rats. 13\nWe used CT-1, an inflammatory cytokine and NT-proBNP, which is a more stable by-\nproduct in the production of BNP. 20 We have clearly shown the benefit of using each \npeptide alone at predicting death or heart failure; indeed NT-proBNP is a well-\nestablished marker for predicting LV dysfunction and prognosis after an acute \nmyocardial infarction. 1 Using a combination of CT-1 and NT-proBNP in a multi-\nmarker risk stratification approach in patients gives an increased area under the ROC \ncurve and more predictive accuracy.  \nThe relationships for prediction exists in quite a heterogeneous group of patients \n(NSTEMI, STEMI, previous history of cardiovascular diseases and age etc) it would \nbe interesting to see if a separation could be made on the basis of presenting \ndiagnosis. What also remains to be seen is the utility of CT-1 at being able to \nindividually predict death or heart failure however a larger powered study would be \nnecessary to answer such a question.  \n 11\nIn conclusion, this is the first report of CT-1 as a prognostic marker of death or heart \nfailure in patients with AMI. This study confirms previous findings that CT-1 is \ninvolved during an AMI and it may be useful in a multimarker approach with NT-\nproBNP for risk stratification in AMI patients.  \n \n \n \n \nAcknowledgments \nDr Sohail Q Khan is supported by a British Heart Foundation Junior Research \nFellowship (FS\/03\/028\/15486).
