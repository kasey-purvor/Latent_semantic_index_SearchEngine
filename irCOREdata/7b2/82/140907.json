Introduction \nIn the last decade trends in aircraft manufacture are towards creation of integral structures via \nmanufacturing processes such as welding, casting and forging, high-speed machining, rather \nthan the traditional riveting [1-2]. This is mainly driven by manufacture cost saving and \nstructural weight reduction for the future aircraft structures. Current welding processes \napplicable to airframe aluminium alloys include the friction stir welding (FSW), laser beam \nwelding (LBW), and plasma arc welding, e.g. the variable polarity plasma arc (VPPA) and \nmetal inert gas (MIG) welding. One of the main advantages of welded structures is the \nsignificant reduction or complete removal of the numerous fasteners and overlapping joint \nareas in the airframe; this will bring down the costs of manufacture and maintenance \nsignificantly, and also the structural weight. The absence of fastener holes will also remove \nthe crack initiation sources resulting in much improved fatigue endurance and simplification \nin inspection.  \nWelding also produces adverse effects on fatigue crack growth (FCG) rate due to thermal \nresidual stresses, local distortions (especially in thin alloy sheets) and the microstructure and \nhardness changes in the heat-affected zones (HAZ). Whereas all of these affect the FCG rates, \nthermal residual stress has been identified as the most influential factor, and this was \ndemonstrated in the friction stir welds [3-4] and plasma welds [5]. Efforts have been devoted \nto the investigation of residual stress effect on FCG rates [e.g. 3-14].  \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n \n3 \nTwo methods have been widely used to calculate FCG rates in residual stress fields. One \nemploys the superposition rule to determine the effective stress ratio (Reff) to account for the \nresiduals stress effect [7-8]. The other is based on the crack closure concept originally \nproposed by Elber [15] by calculating the crack opening stress intensity factor (Kopen) and then \nthe effective stress intensity factor range (\u2206Keff) in a combined stress field of the applied and \nresidual. The validity of both methods has been generally accepted. For the second approach, \nsome researchers calculate Kopen by empirical formulas [8-10], whereas others by the finite \nelement method [11, 13].   \nThe key task for the first method is to determine the Kres using either the weight function \nmethod (WFM) or the finite element method (FEM). The WFM has been successfully used by \nseveral researchers, e.g. [7, 14, 16], for simple geometries. FEM is more powerful and robust \nwhen general SIF solutions cannot be found due to the complexity in either geometry or \nloading conditions. The subsequent task is to calculate the FCG rates by empirical laws. The \nmost frequently used are in the form of da\/dN = f(\u2206K, R). The Walker [17], Hater T-method \n[18], and NASGRO equation [18] all belong to this category. Another method is the so-called \nalternate superposition approach, in which Ktot,max and Ktot,min are calculated at the cyclic \nmaximum and minimum stresses and then find the range \u2206Ktot. Negative Ktot,min value is set to \nzero [e.g. 8, 19-20]. A two-parameter rule was also proposed to take account of the Kmax \ncontribution in the form of da\/dN = f(\u2206K, Kmax) [21-22]. \nThe objective of this paper is to present a simple method for predicting FCG rate using the \nbase material coupon test data and the effective stress ratio to account for the residual stress \neffect. FEM was used for calculating the SIF due to the applied and residual stress fields. The \nWalker, Harter T-method and NASGRO equation were employed for calculating the FCG \nrate. The predicted results were validated by test data of an M(T) specimen with a \nlongitudinal VPPA weld for two load cases: constant amplitude loads for R ratios of 0.1 and \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n \n4 \n0.6 and constant stress intensity factor ranges. The purpose is to demonstrate that if the base \nmaterial FCG rates are measured for two different nominal R ratios, then FCG rates of welded \npanels can be predicted by these empirical laws using the effective stress ratio to account for \nthe welding residual stress effect.  \nDuring the course of this research we have also found a computational issue that is worth \nreporting, that is, if the total strain energy release rate due to the applied and residual stresses \nis calculated by two separate FE analyses under the respective applied stress fields, then the \nmutual work due to the interactions of the two stress fields must be counted in the total strain \nenergy term. This is demonstrated in an example in this paper.  \n2. FE modelling approach \n2.1 Specimen and material properties \nTest sample in [12, 13] was used in this study that is a middle-crack tension, M(T), geometry \nmade of aluminium alloy 2024-T351. The sample contains a longitudinal weld by single pass \nautogenous variable polarity plasma arc (VPPA) welding process. Dimensions and weld \norientation are shown in Fig. 1. Base material properties are E = 73 GPa, yield and ultimate \ntensile strengths 372 and 470 MPa, respectively.  \n2.2 Inputting initial residual stress field into FE model \nIn [5, 13], the neutron diffraction technique was used to measure the welding residual strains \nin the longitudinal, transverse and normal directions, which were subsequently converted to \nthe corresponding residual stresses in all three directions. This initial residual stress filed is \nself-balanced and exists before any external mechanical loads being applied to the specimen \nand prior to the introduction of an initial crack.  \nMany researchers have developed methods to input residual stresses into the FE models [e.g. \n13]. In this study two approaches were adopted, i.e. inputting equivalent initial displacements \nand inputting measured residual stresses. In the first method, initial displacements were \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n \n5 \ndetermined from measured residual strains in both the longitudinal and transverse directions. \nThese displacements were then inputted into the FE model as an initial condition by a \nsubroutine interfacing the ABAQUS code. From these initially applied displacements a \ndistribution of residual stresses is imposed to the FE model. In the second method, measured \nresidual stress distribution was inputted into the FE model using an ABAQUS subroutine \nnamed SIGINI. After inputting the stresses, ABAQUS command \u201cUNBALANCED STRESSES\u201d \nwas called to balance the inputted stresses to satisfy the equilibrium condition. It is also \nnecessary to relax the stresses under the equilibrium condition to make the stress-free \ncondition at the free edges. Without external loads, the specimen is self-balanced under the \ninitial residual stress filed.  \nThe inputted residual stresses by both methods are shown in Fig. 2, which are in good \nagreement with the measured data published in [13]. Directly inputting residual stresses \nmatches the experimental data better than inputting equivalent initial displacements. Since \neach node must be constrained for the displacement input method, this method cannot be used \nto model residual stress re-distribution during crack growth. The stress input method is a \nbetter approach because the condition of the virtual work principle is satisfied and the \nevolution of the residual stresses due to crack extension can be modelled.   \n2.3 Modelling crack extension under static load and residual stress redistribution \nAnalyses were performed by 2D FE models using the commercial code ABAQUS (standard \nversion 6.6) [23]. Quadrilateral 4-node shell elements with reduced integration were used and \nplane stress condition was assumed. The mesh size near the crack tip region and along the \ncrack growth path was 0.5 x 0.5 mm. Because of the geometrical symmetry only a quarter of \nthe plate was modelled. For each crack length, SIF was calculated at the applied stress level \nfollowed by releasing the crack-tip node to the next crack length. This process was repeated \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n \n6 \nfor the crack length range from the initial to the final crack size. Therefore, residual stress \nredistribution due to crack extension was modelled.   \nFig. 3 shows the redistribution of residual stresses for different crack lengths and comparison \nwith measured data in [13]. Since the FE analysis was linear elastic, there is a peak in the \ncalculated stress distribution near the crack tip position that is much higher than the measured \nvalue due to the stress singularity effect and such peak stress is dependent on the FE mesh \nsize. In this very small crack tip zone comparison with the experimental data is poor. \nHowever, away from the crack tip region the calculated residual stress distribution due to \ncrack extension agrees with the measured. The discrepancy in the crack-tip stress values \nshould not affect the fracture mechanics analysis conducted in this study, since the SIF was \ncalculated indirectly from the strain energy release rate.  \n2.4 Calculating Kapp, Kres and Ktot \n1) MVCCT approach \nThe modified virtual crack closure technique known as the MVCCT or VCCT method [24] \nwas used for calculating the strain energy release rate (SERR or G) due to crack extension:  \n)(\n2\n1 *\n, jjiyy vvF\nat\nG \u2212\n\u2206\n=       (1) \nwhere Fyy,i is the nodal reaction force perpendicular to the crack growth path at the crack tip \nnode i, (vj - vj*) the crack opening displacement at node j immediately behind the crack tip as \nshown in Fig. 4, \u2206a the crack extension length that equals to the crack tip element size, and t \nthe plate thickness.   \nStress intensity factor (SIF or K) can be found by:  \nGEK =  (plane stress) 21 \u03c5\u2212=\nGEK\n (plane strain)  (2) \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n \n7 \nThe relation between K and G only holds for the linear elastic material behaviour. Since the \nVCCT is an energy-based method, calculated G and K values are less dependent on the finite \nelement mesh size.  \n2) The total SIF (Ktot) \nSuperposition has been widely used in the framework of LEFM, especially when the weight \nfunction method is employed to estimate the Kres. Two separate analyses are necessary to find \nthe Kapp and Kres and then the Ktot:   \nresapptot KKK +=        (3)  \nThe calculations of strain energy release rate and SIF described in eqs. (1) & (2) can be \nperformed separately for both externally applied and internal residual stress fields. As \nillustrated in Fig. 5, by applying the respective stress field to the same FE model, Gapp and \nGres can be found by eq. (1) and then Kapp and Kres be calculated by eq. (2) for the respective \nstress fields.  \nFig. 6 shows the calculated Kres by FEM and the initial residual stress distribution for the case \ngiven in section 2.1. The horizontal axis is the half crack length that is also the distance from \nthe weld centre. Since the plate was subjected to the initial residual stress field only, the \ncalculated Kres follows the same trend of the initial residual stress distribution.  \nAn alternative approach to calculate the Ktot is to subject the FE model to a combined stress \nfield of the applied and residual stresses. Gtot can be found by eq. (1) with Fyy,i and (vj - vj*) \nrepresenting the crack-tip force and crack opening displacement under the combined stress \nfiled.  Ktot can then be found by:  \nEGK tottot =  (plane stress) 21 \u03c5\u2212=\nEG\nK tottot (plane strain)  (4) \nOnly one FE analysis is needed. Calculated Ktot by eq. (3) and (4) have been validated against \npublished work; both equations give the same result.   \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n \n8 \nWhereas superposition of stress intensity factors has been widely used, especially when Kres is \ncalculated by the WFM, it should be pointed out that simply summing the two strain energy \nrelease rate terms, Gapp and Gres, will not deliver the correct value of Gtot. The work done by \nthe externally applied stress interacts with the work done by the internal residual stresses, and \nvice versa. Therefore, the mutual work done by the reaction forces due to applied stress (Fapp) \nover the displacement caused by the residual stresses (vres) should be counted, and vice versa \n(Figs. 5a & 5b). From the MVCCT formula the total strain energy release rate (Gtot) should \nalso contain the mutual work term: \n)()(\n2\n1\nresappresapptot vvFF\nat\nG +\u22c5+\n\u2206\n=       (5) \nmutresappappresresappresresappapptot GGGvFvFvFvF\nat\nG ++=+++\n\u2206\n= )(\n2\n1\n (6) \nwhere, the mutual work term is expressed as: \n  )(\n2\n1\nappresresappmut vFvF\nat\nG +\n\u2206\n=       (7) \nIf one attempts to find Gtot by conducting two separate FE analyses to find Gapp and Gres and \nto simply sum them, then the mutual work contribution is lost. This can be demonstrated by \nFig. 7, where the superposition of K (Ktot = Kapp + Kres) is plotted in Fig. 7a and superposition \nof G with and without the mutual work in Fig. 7b. Calculations to obtain Ktot are performed by \neither superposition using eq. (3) or via computing the total strain energy release rate by eq. \n(4); Ktot values determined by both methods are identical. Mathematical deductions of the \nmutual work are given in Appendix A.  \nIt is important to point out that this does not contradict to the mixed mode fracture problems, \nwhere contribution to the Gtot from the SERR of three different load modes (GI, GII and GIII) \nare additive because SERR is a scalar quantity [25]. In this case, the mutual work terms are \ncalculated from the crack-tip force and displacement caused by two different loading modes, \ne.g. force caused by the mode I load and displacement by mode II load. Since the force and \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n \n9 \ndisplacement are orthogonal to each other, the product of them is zero, i.e. no mutual work is \ndone. In the case presented in this paper the mutual energy terms are not orthogonal (both are \nin mode I). However, when thermal residual stresses or secondary bending occur in the mixed \nmode problems, the mutual work between those loads must be considered.  \n3. Predicting fatigue crack growth rates \nGlinka [6] and Parker [7] originally proposed the superposition method based on the principle \nof linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). Under the cyclic loads, the total SIF range (\u2206Ktot) \nand effective SIF ratio (R\neff) are calculated as:  \n,max ,min( ) ( )tot app res app res appK K K K K K\u2206 = + \u2212 + = \u2206    (8)  \n,min ,max( ) \/( )eff app res app resR K K K K= + +      (9) \nTherefore under cyclic loads, only the Reff changes due to the presence of residual stresses. It\u2019s \nworth noting that R\neff is the crack tip stress ratio based on the calculated values of Ktot,max and \nKtot,min, hence Reff is not the same as the nominal applied stress ratio (R). The Walker [17], Harter \nT-method [18], and NASGRO [18] equations were used to calculate FCG rates using R\neff to \nreplace the nominal R ratio in the original equations.  \nOriginal Walker equation is expressed as: \n( 1)( (1 ) )m n\napp\nda C K R\ndN\n\u2212\n= \u2206 \u2212       (10) \nWhere C and n are the coefficients of the Paris law, m a constant that can be found from test \ndata conducted at two different nominal stress ratios (R1 and R2): \n1 2\n2 1\n(1 )1 log \/ log (1 )\nK R\nm\nK R\n\uf8ee \uf8f9\uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8eb \uf8f6\u2206 \u2212\n= + \uf8ef \uf8fa\uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ec \uf8f7\u2206 \u2212\uf8ed \uf8f8 \uf8ed \uf8f8\uf8f0 \uf8fb  for 0,0 21 \u2265\u2265 RR   (11) \nThe value of m is controlling the shift of the crack growth rate curves for different R ratios \nand it depends on the material properties.  \nConsidering the welding residual stress effect the Walker equation is expressed as:  \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n \n10 \n( 1)( (1 ) )m napp eff\nda C K R\ndN\n\u2212\n= \u2206 \u2212       (12) \nSubstitute Reff by eq.

The AFGROW code uses the Walker equation \non a point-by-point basis (Harter T-Method) to determine crack growth rate shifting as a \nfunction of the stress ratio [18].  \nConsidering the welding residual stress effect the original NASGRO equation is expressed as:  \n, ax\n1\n1\n1\n1\np\nth\nn\napp\napp q\neff app m res\ncrit\nK\nKda fC K\ndN R K K\nK\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\u2206\n\u2212\uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8ee \uf8f9 \u2206\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\u2212 \uf8ed \uf8f8\n= \u2206\uf8ef \uf8fa\uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\u2212 +\uf8eb \uf8f6\uf8ef \uf8fa\uf8ed \uf8f8\uf8f0 \uf8fb\n\u2212\uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8ed \uf8f8\n   (14) \n4. Validation of prediction method   \nPredicted FCG rates were compared with test results for an M(T) specimen made of \naluminium alloy 2024-T351 welded by the VPPA process as described in Section 2.1. Two \ncases were considered: constant amplitude loads with two different R ratios and constant \n\u2206Kapp. Experimental results are taken from [12-13]. The Walker, Harter T-method, and \nNASGRO equation were employed to calculate the crack growth rates. Material constants \nused in the Walker and NASGRO equations were found from the NASGRO database [26] and \nlisted in Table 1.  \n4.1 Constant amplitude load  \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n \n11 \nFig. 8a shows the predicted FCG rates for the R = 0.1 case at constant applied stress range of \n46.35 MPa. For comparison the base material growth rate is also shown which was calculated \nby the NASGRO equation. For the welded joint, both NASGRO and Harter T-method give \ngood predictions with typical error range of \u00b15% compared to the measured. Walker equation \nunderestimates the FCG rate considerably when half crack length (a) is larger than 17 mm \nwith an error range of 15-30%.  \nFig. 8b shows the R = 0.6 case with applied stress range of 42.6 MPa. For this test, the Harter \nT-method and NASGRO give good predictions. Walker equation gives good prediction when \na < 17 mm. It should be noted that in the measured crack growth rate curve there is a sudden \nchange of the curve trend from a convex to concave within the crack length of 7.5 to 11.5 \nmm, whereas the predicted curves are generally in a convex shape. The base material growth \nrate is also shown that is very close to the measured growth rates for the welded sample. The \ncase is further discussed in Section 5.  \n4.2 Constant SIF range  \nIn this case crack growth test was conducted by keeping the SIF range (\u2206Kapp) constant. \nNominal stress ratio R = 0.1 was maintained throughout the test. According to the Paris law, \nFCG rate for the base material will remain constant for different crack lengths. However, \ncrack growth rate in the welded sample will change along the distance from the weld centre \ndue to the presence of the welding residual stresses. For constant \u2206Kapp, following set of \nequations can be deduced: \nmax min( )appK a\u03c3 \u03c3 \u03b2 pi\u2206 = \u2212 = constant    (15) \nSince a constant R ratio was maintained during the test, the maximum and minimum applied \nstresses and respective stress intensity factors are functions of the crack length: \n  \naaR\nK\na\napp\npi\u03b2\u03c3 )()1()(max \u2212\n\u2206\n=    and maxmin )( \u03c3\u03c3 Ra =    (16) \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n \n12 \n  \n,max max 1app\nKK a\nR\n\u03c3 \u03b2 pi \u2206= =\n\u2212\n and \n,min min 1app\nR KK a\nR\n\u03c3 \u03b2 pi \u2206= =\n\u2212\n (17) \n  \n, in\n, ax\napp m res\neff\napp m res\nK K\nR\nK K\n+\n=\n+\n       (18) \nIn the FCG life prediction analysis, \u2206Kapp (a constant) and Reff are used to replace the \u2206K and R \nin the original Walker, Harter T-method, and NASGRO equations.  \nExperimental test results were reported in [12] for \u2206Kapp = 4, 6, 11 and 15 MPa\u0001m. Good \nagreement with the test results is achieved for the lower SIF ranges (\u2206Kapp = 4, 6). However, \nfor higher SIF range (\u2206Kapp = 11, 15), the agreement is not so good. Examples showing the \ncomparison with the tests are presented in Fig. 9 for \u2206Kapp = 6 and 11 MPa\u0001m.  For both cases, \ncrack growth rates of the welded sample were significantly higher than that of the base \nmaterial due to the presence of tensile residual stresses. Overall the NASGRO equation gives \nbetter prediction comparing to the Walker equation predicted results.   \n \n5. Discussion \n5.1 Using Reff in empirical crack growth laws  \nIn this work welding residual stress effect was accounted for by replacing the nominal R ratio \nwith the effective ratio Reff, which is a function of the Kres that can be determined by either the \nFEM or the WFM. With this Reff, three well-known empirical laws were tested.  \nWalker equation has an appealing advantage for predicting FCG rates in residual stress fields. \nAll one needs to have is a set of measured da\/dN data for two different R ratios for the base \nmaterial. The limitation of the Walker equation is that it is too simplistic and it underestimates \nthe final part of the FCG rates when the SIF approaches the material fracture toughness. \nNASGRO has considered the effect of plasticity induced crack closure by an empirical \nconstant f. Although the crack closure effect on da\/dN can be accounted for by the R ratio to a \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n \n13 \ncertain extent, further correlation of da\/dN with another parameter should yield more accurate \nprediction as demonstrated in the results in Figs. 8 and 9. NASGRO equation also takes \naccount of the final fast crack growth stage when Kmax approaches Kcrit. \nThe NASGRO and Harter T-method account for the stress ratio effect more comprehensively \ncompared to the Walker. In NASGRO the factor f is a direct function of the stress ratio and in \nHarter T-method stress ratio is considered by means of point-to-point shift from available test \ndata. Walker equation predicts much slower crack growth rate compared to the other two \nmethods. For materials where the NASGRO equation coefficients are unknown, the Harter T-\nmethod (which is a modified version of the Walker equation) can be a good prediction tool.  \n5.2 Constant amplitude load case  \nNASGRO equation gives the best prediction of FCG rates for both R ratios due to the fact that \nit has more material \u201cfitting\u201d constants and also takes account of the fast crack growth regime \nwhen Kmax,tot approaches the fracture toughness Kcrit. Fig. 8 shows that difference between the \nNASGRO and Walker predictions began to widen when a > 17 mm. For crack lengths 17\u201320 \nmm, Kmax,tot is in the range of 41\u201357 MPam1\/2. This is close to the fracture toughness of this \nalloy, which is about 65 MPam1\/2 (thickness 7 mm).  \nTo further explore the influence of welding residual stresses, measured crack growth rates \npresented in Figs. 8a & 8b for two different R ratios are plotted together in Fig. 10. The \ncloseness of the two test results for two very different nominal R ratios may be explained by \nthe crack closure concept originally proposed by Elber [15]. It is now widely accepted that \ndifferent da\/dN vs. \u2206Kapp curves for different R ratios can be correlated to a single curve by \nusing the effective stress intensity factor range \u2206Keff [15, 27-28]. For 2024-T3, Elber proposed \nfollowing correlation [15]:  \n   0.5 0.4eff eff\napp app\nK\nU R\nK\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\u2206 \u2206\n= = = +\n\u2206 \u2206\n (R > 0)    (19) \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n \n14 \nBased on test data of wider range of R ratios, Schijve proposed an improved formula for \n2024-T3 sheet material [27]:  \n20.55 0.33 0.12eff eff\napp app\nK\nU R R\nK\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\u2206 \u2206\n= = = + +\n\u2206 \u2206\n (-1.0<R<0.54)  (20) \nBoth equations give close U values for R > 0; hence eq. 19 is used in the following analysis \nfor demonstration purpose.  \nCalculated Reff as function of crack length (which is also the distance from the weld centre) \nare plotted in Fig. 11. For R = 0.1, Reff is very close to 0.65\u20130.7 around the weld centre and \nquickly decreases to 0.5 away from the weld centre; these Reff values are much higher than the \nnominal R ratio. For R = 0.6, Reff is close to 0.75\u20130.8 around the weld centre and decreases to \n0.7 away from the weld centre. Reff values across the sample width are only moderately higher \nthan the nominal R ratio of 0.6.  \nUsing these Reff to replace the nominal R in eq. (19), factor U and \u2206Keff for the welded sample \nare calculated; \u2206Keff is the closure-free SIF range that is the effective crack growth driving \nforce. Calculated \u2206Keff values as function of the crack length are presented in Table 2 for the \ntwo test cases. It is interesting to observe that, the two different test cases (R = 0.1, 0.6) have \nvirtually the same \u2206Keff values resulting in very close crack growth rates as shown in Fig. 10.    \nIn summary, tensile residual stresses (acting like a mean stress) reduce crack closure effect \nand increase crack growth rates. This effect is most pronounced for lower nominal R ratios. \nFor higher R ratios, the influence of Kres on crack growth rates is small. This observation was \npreviously made by authors in [12].  \n5.3 Constant SIF range cases  \nThe base material FCG rate is a constant under constant SIF range; hence the difference \nbetween the FCG rates of the welded and base metal is mainly due to the influence of welding \nresidual stresses, which are accounted for by the Reff. In this study, longitudinal welding \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n \n15 \nresidual stresses around the weld centre are high tensile stresses in the range of 100-150 MPa. \nTherefore Kres and Reff are raised significantly. Fig. 12 shows the calculated Reff values for the \nconstant \u2206Kapp tests manifesting that Reff is much higher for the lower \u2206Kapp values. For \u2206Kapp = \n4 and 6 MPa\u0001m, Reff = 0.6\u20130.86, hence there was almost no crack closure effect and the life \nprediction should be more accurate.  \nBoth the measured and predicted FCG rate trends follow the variation of Kres (Fig. 6), which \nis lower at the fusion boundary (a = 5 mm) and at its peak at a = 17 mm. Walker and \nNASGRO predictions agree well with the tests of lower \u2206Kapp (6 MPa\u0001m). However, \npredictions are not consistent for the higher \u2206Kapp (11 MPa\u0001m), in which Walker equation \ngives better prediction for a < 15 mm.  \nChanges in the microhardness and microstructures in the fusion and heat-affected zones will \naffect the mechanical properties in these zones and hence likely to affect the crack growth \nrates. This effect cannot be quantified by this present model and this may have affected \nprediction accuracy in the crack length range of a = 7 \u2013 15 mm (Fig. 9).  \n6. Conclusions \nAn analysis procedure is presented for predicting FCG rate in welded longitudinal butt joints. \nWelding residual stress effect is accounted for by the effective crack tip stress ratio, which is \nused in empirical crack growth laws. Comparisons are made with measured crack growth \nrates in a VPPA weld of 2024-T351 alloy subjected to constant amplitude load and constant \nSIF range.  \nFor the constant amplitude load case, the Walker, Harter T-method and NASGRO equations \nall give acceptable predictions if the Kmax,tot is well below the material fracture toughness. \nNASGRO gives best prediction for the entire crack length range.  \nFor the constant SIF range cases, predictions are mainly affected by the effective R ratio that \nhas larger influence on lower applied SIF ranges.  \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n \n16 \nIn terms of calculation techniques, inputting initial residual stresses into an FE model and \nmodelling residual stress redistribution with crack growth can be performed by the ABAQUS \nsoftware package. Only the base material crack growth rate data and welding residual stresses \nare required in the analysis. Mutual work due to the interactions of the applied and residual \nstress fields must be counted if the total strain energy release rate is determined from two \nseparate FE analyses.  \nThe proposed method can be generally employed when crack initiates within a weld and \ninitially in tensile residual stress field. This prediction method should work for those materials \nand welding processes, in which fatigue crack growth rates are mainly affected by welding \ninduced thermal residual stresses and the influence of hardness and microstructure changes in \nthe heat affected zones can be neglected. This approach has not been assessed for crack \ninitiation and growth in a compressive residual stress field or crack growth towards a weld, \nnor has it been validated for variable amplitude loads. \n \nAcknowledgement \nThe authors are grateful to the financial support by the European Union through the Sixth \nFramework Programme (FP6).

Mutual work in calculating the total strain energy release rate  \nWhen an FE model is subject to both externally applied and thermal residual stresses, a total \nreaction force yields at each element nodal point that is the sum of the two reaction nodal \nforces if the loads were applied separately: \nresapptot FFF +=       (A1) \nThe corresponding FE nodal displacements are: \ntredapptot vvv +=       (A2) \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n \n17 \nTo determine the mutual work in the strain energy release rate calculation, the starting point is \nthe superposition rule of the K: \nresapptot KKK +=       (A3) \nWhich, under the plane stress condition, can also be written as: \n   EGEGEG resapptot +=      (A4) \nwhere 1\n2tot tot tot\nG F v\nt a\n=\n\u2206\n, \n1\n2app app app\nG F v\nt a\n=\n\u2206\nand 1\n2res res res\nG F v\nt a\n=\n\u2206\n.   \nFrom eq.
