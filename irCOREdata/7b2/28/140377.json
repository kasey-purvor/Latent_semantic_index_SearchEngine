INTRODUCTION \n \nIn the past few years several biological molecules have been explored for their use in electronics and photonics \napplications. Bacteriorhodopsin (bR),1 has received the most attention because of its outstanding optical properties and \nexcellent stability against chemical, thermal and photochemical degradation. bR is a retinal-protein complex; the \nabsorption of a light quantum by the retinal leads to reversible colour changes from purple to yellow due to protein \nconformational changes, the molecule finally returning to the ground state. In other words, a cycle of reactions is \ninitiated by light, during which the bR molecule passes from one intermediate state to another, the process being \ncharacterized by displacements of the optical absorption bands2. Figure 1 shows a simplified model of the bR \nphotocycle2. \n \nFigure 1: Photocycle of bR. Direct and back reactions, lifetime parameters of the photocycle intermediates, and the stages of \nprotonation and deprotonation of the Schiff base are given. \nIntegrated Optics: Theory and Applications, edited by Tadeusz Pustelny, Paul V.

For practical sensing applications, one can monitor \nthe spectral and kinetic parameters of films made from bR incorporated into a matrix. Consideration of the question of \nexternal influences (e.g. due to the presence of ambient chemical substances) on the bR photochromic processes is of \nprime importance.  By changing external conditions (temperature, hydrostatic pressure, electrical field intensity etc.) one \ncan influence the photoinduced processes of the light-sensitive retinal-protein complex3, 4. The chemical environment of \nbR also influences the photocycle parameters5. For example, humidity6, 7, solutions of local anaesthetics8, organic \nvapours9, ammonium ions and amines10, 11, and ammonia12 all have demonstrable effects on the spectral and kinetic \nparameters. The effect of pH has also been studied13. \nInclusion of halogen-, nitrogen-, and sulphur-containing substances (called chemical additives) in various combinations \ninto the film is a way to permanently modify the photosensitive and temporal characteristics of the photocycle over a \nwide range7, 8, 14, with the possibility of enhancing the chemical sensitivity and selectivity of the films. \nPolymer matrices, due to their simple and well-proven technology, are widely-used for the creation of films based on bR.  \nThey practically do not change the optical parameters and allow the preparion of bR in the form of thin films, which is \nconvenient for practical applications. \nUse of polymer matrices allows the creation of the sensitive elements based on bR for optical vapour sensors12. The \ndrawback of the polymer matrix is its solubility, which makes it impossible to use it for the monitoring of aqueous media. \nEncapsulation of bR into a transparent, water insoluble matrix may solve this disadvantage, provided a bR-compatible \nmaterial of adequate optical quality can be found. \nThe sol\u2013gel process is a convenient and versatile method of preparing transparent optical and water insoluble matrices at \nmoderate temperatures15. Ambient processing conditions enable one to create composite optical materials with numerous \norganic, organometallic and biological molecules embedded within a porous matrix of sol\u2013gel glass16. Most sol\u2013gel \ntechniques use water and low molecular weight alkoxides such as tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and tetramethoxysilane \n(TMOS) as sol\u2013gel precursors17. \nHydrolysis and condensation of tetra-alkoxysilanes during the sol\u2013gel process help to form a solid silicate around the \nsensing molecule, which is dissolved in the liquid phase16. \nbR retains its optical properties when entrapped in silicate glass by the sol-gel process18, 19,  and could therefore be used \nfor the envisaged biosensor application10. The preparation of dry films based on bR of high optical quality will \nconsiderably enhance the area of bR applications as sensitive elements of integrated optic and fibre-optic sensors. Here \nwe present the results from the technological development of preparing bacteriorhodopsin (bR) films in a sol-gel matrix. \nThe result demonstrated that in water solutions the films based on bR in a sol-gel matrix retained their photoactivity. \n \n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n \n2.1 Sample preparation \nBacteriorhodopsin was extracted as purple membrane fragments (pmf) from Halobacterium salinarum, strain S9, \ncultured in our laboratory, according to standard procedures1,14. Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) (Fluka Company, \nSwitzerland) were used as precursors for the sol-gel glass. The sol-gel glass was prepared with slightly modified methods \ndescribed earlier18. TEOS (7 ml), 3.0 ml of distilled water and 0.1 ml of 0.04 M HC1 were mixed together and sonicated \nfor 20 min. The resulting product was diluted with an equal volume of distilled water. The resulting mixture (0.5 ml) was \nmixed with 0.25 ml sodium borate buffer solution (pH 9) and (0.1 ml, 0.2 ml) bR solution (14 mg\/ml) to create a film-\nforming solution with different bR concentrations. \nTriethanolamine (TEA) (Sigma) and dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTMAB) (Sigma) were chosen as \nsensitizing additives. The concentration of chemical additives was in the range of 0.01\u20130.4 M. For the preparation of \nchemically modified films, bR solution was mixed with TEA and DTMAB, before mixing with the sol mixture, and \nafterwards 0.02 ml of the bR-chemical additives mixture was added to 0.12 ml of the sol mixture.  \nThe film-forming mixture (0.1 ml) was deposited onto 5 cm2 glass substrates for the creation of thick (20 \u00b5m) pure sol-\ngel films and films of bR in the sol-gel matrix. The films were kept in the refrigerator at 4 0C for 24 hours. Surface \nmeasurements and cross section morphology were carried out using AFM and SEM. \nThe thin (< 1 \u00b5m) films were prepared by spin-coating methods, by deposition of a drop, with a volume of about 5 \u00b5l, of \nthe film-forming mixture onto a rotating (2500 rpm) glass substrate. \n \n \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 5956  595616-2\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 20 Jun 2011 to 138.250.109.230. Terms of Use:  http:\/\/spiedl.org\/terms\n2.2. Film characterization \nSurface morphology of the films based on bR in the sol-gel matrix was studied with the help of a Jeol JSPM 5210 atomic \nforce microscope. Films were deposited onto 5 mm2 glass substrates. Measurement was done in non-contact mode.  \nThe morphology of the surface and cross-sections of the bR-based films was studied using a Hitachi S-5200 field \nemission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) at the Instrumentation Center, the University of Kitakyushu. Before \nmeasurements the films were vacuum dried for 6 hours in order to remove all water from the samples. \nThe spectral static or temporal characteristics were measured at room temperature using an HR2000 Ocean Optics fibre-\noptic spectrophotometer and a double beam Jasco V-550 UV-vis spectrophotometer. \nFor the measurements of photoinduced absorption changes an Ocean Optics LS-450 Blue LED Pulsed Light Source with \nthe LED-518 (\u03bb =518 nm) was used for photo excitation of the bR photocycle. The light was transported by means of a \nsingle 1000 \u00b5m optical fiber (Ocean Optics, QP1000-2-UV-VIS) to the film fixed in the spectrophotometer chamber. \nThe measurement was done at the wavelength 410 and 570 nm, which correspond to the absorption maxima of the main \nintermediate M410 of the bR photocycle and the ground state bR570. The optical power density of the actinic light was \nunites of mW\/cm2. For the differential spectra, the spectrum of the illuminated sample was measured 5 min after the \nactinic light started. \nThe photoinduced absorption changes were calculated as the normalized ratio of the maximum absorbance of the \nunbleached sample (\u0410570max - \u0410570maxbleached)\/ \u0410570max. \nAlso measured was the half-time of the M state decay (\u03c41\/2), i.e. the time to achieve a change of absorbance of 0.5 after \nturning off the actinic illumination. \n \n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n3.1 Sample morphology and structural characterization \nThe surface of the TEOS film prepared by layering and drying is uniform and possesses a low roughness (Fig. 2). \nIncorporation of bR into the TEOS sol-gel matrix considerably increases the film surface roughness (Fig. 3). We assume \nthat it is due to aggregation of the fragments of purple membranes and formation of big bR conglomerates. The \ndeposition of sol-gel films onto the glass substrate by spin-coating can improve the films, optical quality.  \nThe studies of film cross sections showed that films have a uniform nanostructure characterized by purple membrane \nfragments with an average diameter of 0.5 \u00b5m and width 5 nm evenly stacked practically parallel to the substrate surface \nin the matrix (Fig. 4 and 5).

The new \nmaximum at 410 nm indicates the formation of the photointermediate M410 and proved that bR retains its photoactivity in \nthe dry sol-gel film (Fig. 7). \nThe main parameters of the bR photocycle are the formation kinetics and the decay half-time of the M410 intermediate. \nThe photoinduced absorption changes of films based on bR in sol-gel matrix, monitored at 410 nm and 570 nm, which \ncorrespond to the absorption maxima of the M intermediate and the bR ground state, are shown in Figure 8. Inclusion of \nthe chemical additives into the film composition increases the lifetime of the M intermediate and of the corresponding \nphotoinduced absorption changes (Fig. 9). The main optical characteristics for the films based on bR in sol-gel matrix \nwith different chemical additives are summarized in Table 1.

(a) 410 nm; (b) 570 nm. \n \nWater plays a very important role in the bR photocycle20, 21. With decreasing relative humidity a blue shift in the \nabsorbance maximum for the bR film along with a decrease of absorption is observed6. Different matrices possess \ndifferent porosities and they will contain different amounts of water around the bR molecule, which will influence the \nproperties of bR photocycle. In order to check the effect of the matrix materials on the photoinduced bR optical \nproperties, the parameters of films based on bR in polymeric matrices and in a sol-gel glass matrix were compared. The \ndifferential absorption spectra of the films based on bR in different matrices is shown in Figure 10. \nComparing three different films types: bR in polyvinyl alcohol, in gelatin and in sol-gel glass, it is evident that the \ngelatin film contains the largest amount of available water and the polyvinyl alcohol film the least. In the polyvinyl \nalcohol water is strong bonded with the polymer chains (via numerous hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of the \npolyvinyl alcohol) and is not accessible to the bR chromophore21. \nThese results demonstrate the possibility to control and modify bR photocycle properties by choosing the matrix type. \n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                    \n400 500 600 700 800\n-0.04\n-0.03\n-0.02\n-0.01\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n3\n2\n1\nwavelength \/ nm\nab\nso\nrb\nan\nce\n c\nha\nng\ne\n \nFigure 10: Differential absorbance spectra (light minus dark) of films based on bR in different matrices; 1, bR in gelatin; 2, bR in \nTEOS; 3, bR in polyvinyl alcohol. \n \n3.4 Performance of bR film in liquid medium \nIn order to check the performance of bR films in liquid solutions the optical characteristics of films based on bR in the \nsol-gel matrix were measured in films immersed into the water. Figure 11 depict the photoinduced absorption changes of \nbR films in air and in water. The film based on bR in a sol-gel glass was not dissolved and retained its photoactivity in \nthe liquid medium. Absorption changes of the film immersed into the water can be due to decreasing of the light \nscattering in the bR film in sol-gel glass. Penetration of water into pores displaces the air in the pore, and decreases the \nmismatch between refractive indexes of sol-gel matrix and its pores, resulting on decreasing of light scattering. \n \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 5956  595616-6\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 20 Jun 2011 to 138.250.109.230.
