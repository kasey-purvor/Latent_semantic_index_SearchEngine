INTRODUCTION\nThe nature of microscopic engines, such as molecular mo-\ntors, has been the subject of much research over the last five\nor six years. This recent activity was stimulated by the pos-\nsibility of noise-induced currents @1\u20134#, and was motivated\nto a large extent by the desire to model protein motors. These\nare proteins which are connected to a biopolymer and cata-\nlyze the conversion of adenosine triphosphate ~ATP! to ad-\nenosine diphosphate ~ADP!. The energy released by this pro-\ncess is used by the motor protein to generate motion along\nthe biopolymer in one particular direction. This is modelled\nas a microscopic object moving unidirectionally along a one-\ndimensional periodic structure @5#. It is this problem of rec-\ntifying processes at small scales that has stimulated most of\nthe theoretical work in this area. A key ingredient is the\npresence of random Brownian forces. As a consequence it is\nnatural to describe these stochastic ratchets, as they are fre-\nquently called, as a particle moving in a periodic potential\nsubject to noise and to formulate this mathematically as a\nLangevin equation\nmx\u00a8 1ax\u02d9 1]xV~x ,t !5j~ t !, ~1!\nwhere x(t) is the coordinate of the particle, a is a friction\nconstant, V(x ,t) is a periodic asymmetric potential and j(t)\nis the noise.\nBefore discussing Eq. ~1! in more detail, we should point\nout that there are at least three other reasons for the renewed\ninterest in such systems. The first is a new generation of\nexperiments that can be performed in vitro @5#, which has led\nto the increased sophistication of the models now studied.\nThe second is the application of these ideas to nonbiological\nsituations at small scales\u2014the realm of nanotechnology. Fi-\nnally, this problem throws up fundamental questions con-\ncerning irreversibility and the second law of thermodynam-\nics. These issues are discussed extensively elsewhere @5#, so\nwe will just make the essential point that it is only if detailedPRE 611063-651X\/2000\/61~1!\/139~8!\/$15.00balance holds that we can use considerations based on the\nsecond law to decide that no coherent unidirectional motion\nis possible @6#.\nThe classification of different types of ratchets is in fact\nmost easily carried out with reference to Eq. ~1!, since the\nterminology used to describe ratchets ~correlation, flashing!\nis not always applied consistently. Nearly all studies neglect\nthe inertial term in Eq. ~1! and scale time by a , so that the\ncoefficient of the x\u02d9 term is unity. Most studies have focussed\non the cases ~i! V(x ,t)5V(x) is deterministic and j(t) is\nnonwhite-noise ~so that detailed balance does not hold!, ~ii!\nV(x ,t)5V(x)f(t) where f(t) may be deterministic or ran-\ndom @7# and j(t) is white noise. Since the main prerequisite\nfor any ratchet is that the system does not obey detailed\nbalance and, since detailed balance may be violated in many\ndifferent ways, it is clear that many other forms are possible.\nIn this paper we will study a ratchet of the type ~i! dis-\ncussed above, sometimes called a correlation ratchet. In Sec.\nII the model is described in more detail: the potential is\nspecified as is the type of noise\u2014quasimonochromatic noise\n~QMN! @8#, whose application to ratchets was first discussed\nin Ref. @2#. We study the model using analytic techniques in\nSecs. III and IV and by the digital and analog simulations\nwhich are discussed in Sec. V. We end with an analysis of\nresults and conclusions. Some of our preliminary work has\nalready been reported @9#.\nII. MODEL\nIn this section we will write down an explicit representa-\ntion for a correlation ratchet acted upon by quasimonochro-\nmatic noise. Having said this, it only remains to specify the\npotential V(x). We have already indicated that this function\nshould be periodic and asymmetric. A natural choice would\ntherefore be a sawtooth potential: as shown in Ref. @2#, a\nsawtooth potential is the one which maximizes the current.\nHowever, in order to carry out analog experiments we take\nthe first few Fourier modes of such a potential leading to the\nform139 \u00a92000 The American Physical Society\n140 PRE 61M. ARRAYA\u00b4 S et al.V~x !52 cos x1sin x1\n1\n3cos~2x !1\n1\n10cos~3x !. ~2!\nThe sawtooth and the approximation to it, Eq. ~2!, are both\nshown in Fig. 1, where we can see that we are modelling the\nsawtooth potential by rounding the corners. This not only\nmakes it easier to reproduce in an analog experiment, but it\nalso removes possible singularities in the theoretical treat-\nment: the \u2018\u2018sharp corners\u2019\u2019 at the top and bottom of the po-\ntential would mean that the force that the particle would feel\nwould be not well defined.\nTherefore the model is defined by the Langevin equation\nx\u02d9 1V8~x !5j~ t !, ~3!\nwhere V(x) is given by Eq. ~2! and the noise j(t) is taken to\nbe Gaussian with zero mean and correlation function\n^j~v!j~v8!&52D 2p C~v!d~v1v8!. ~4!\nWe choose j to be quasimonochromatic noise ~QMN! since\nit exactly suits our purposes: the noise cannot be white, for\nreasons described in the last section and it has the physically\nappealing feature of having a peak at a nonzero frequency in\nits power spectrum ~hence the name @8# QMN!, while being\nsimple enough to allow analytic progress to be made. Spe-\ncifically, the noise is defined by\nC21~v!5~v22v0\n2!214G2v2. ~5!\nC(v) is sharply peaked at the frequency (v0222G2)1\/2\u2019v0\nin the limit G!v0, and so we will frequently be working in\nthis regime. This type of noise can also be viewed as the\nresult of passing white noise through a harmonic oscillator\nfilter:\nj\u00a8 12Gj\u02d9 1v0\n2j5h ~6!\n~hence the name \u2018\u2018harmonic\u2019\u2019 @10,11#, which is also often\nused! where the white noise h has strength D.\nWe shall be mounting a three-pronged attack on the prob-\nlem posed above: an analytic treatment based a small D ap-\nproximation, direct digital simulation of the Langevin equa-\ntion, to be discussed in Sec. V, and an analog simulation also\nFIG. 1. ~a! Sawtooth potential. ~b! \u2018\u2018Smoothed sawtooth\u2019\u2019\npotential.to be discussed in Sec. V. In the case of the analog simula-\ntion, the first task, before simulating the Langevin equation\nitself, is to check the quality of the QMN produced by the\nanalogue circuit. In order to accomplish this, we examine the\nQMN spectrum simulated by ~6!. Two examples are shown\nin Figs. 2 and 3.\nIt is evident that there is good agreement between the\nnoise generated in the simulations and the theoretical result\ngiven by Eq. ~5!. It is also clear from these figures that the\nshape of the spectrum changes considerably depending on\nthe values of the parameters G and v . In fact, these figures\nillustrate the two regimes for QMN noise. The first ~Fig. 2! is\nan example of the case v0\n2.2G2. The spectrum has a local\nminimum at v50, rising to a maximum value at v25v0\n2\n22G2, and then falling off to zero as v\u2192\u2018 . As we have\nremarked already, in the limit v0\n2@2G2 the peak becomes\nnarrower and better defined. Moreover, for values of v such\nthat v!v0, the spectrum is essentially flat and approximates\nwell white noise. On the other hand Fig. 3 illustrates the case\nv0\n2,2G2, where the spectrum has a local maximum at v\n50 and falls away to zero as v\u2192\u2018 . So, in summary, if the\ndamping parameter G is small enough, the power spectrum\nhas a peak at nonzero frequency. As G increases, the peak\nbroadens and moves towards zero frequency. For G greater\nthan a critical value of v0 \/A2 the maximum of the power\nspectrum is at zero frequency. Our aim is to see how the\ncurrent changes as the noise parameters G and v0 vary.\nFIG. 2.

GENERAL FORMALISM\nIn this section we discuss the approach we will use to\nexplore analytically the generation of noise-induced currents\nin the correlation ratchet introduced in the previous section.\nThe method will involve an asymptotic analysis in the limit\nwhere the noise strength D tends to zero. To construct the\nasymptotic expansion it is first necessary to formulate the\nproblem defined by the Langevin equation ~3! in a different\nform. There are at least two different ways to proceed. One is\nto write down an equivalent Fokker-Planck equation. Since\nthe noise j(t) in Eq. ~3! is not white, it is first necessary to\nconvert the process into an equivalent Markovian one with\nthree degrees of freedom, (x ,j ,j\u02d9 ), say. Thus the Fokker-\nPlanck equation will have the form of time-dependent partial\ndifferential equation in three dimensions. We shall not pur-\nsue this method here, instead we will use the approach of\nexpressing the conditional probability ^d\u0084x2x(t)\u0085& IC as an\naverage over all possible paths ~or realizations of the pro-\ncess! with given initial conditions, denoted here by IC. These\ninitial conditions specify not only the initial values of x(t),\nbut also of j(t) and of j\u02d9 (t) at t5t0. The explicit form for the\npath-integral is @12#\nP~x ,tuIC,t0!5^d\u0084x2x~ t !\u0085& IC5E\nIC\nDxP@x#d\u0084x2x~ t !\u0085,\n~7!\nwhere Dx is the appropriate measure defined so that P is\ncorrectly normalized and\nP@x#5J@x#exp2S@x#\/D . ~8!\nHere S@x# is the action functional, which will be discussed in\nmore detail below, and J@x# is the Jacobian of the transfor-\nmation from h(t) to x(t), for which we will not require an\nexplicit form.\nThe method for finding S@x# is discussed in some detail in\nRef. @13#, but we can obtain it relatively quickly from Eqs.\n~3! and ~6! by first writing\n@x\u02d9 1V8~x !#1\n2G\nv0\n2 @x\n\u00a8 1x\u02d9 V9~x !#\n1\n1\nv0\n2 @ x^ 1x\n\u00a8 V9~x !1x\u02d9 2V-~x !#\n5v0\n22h~ t !. ~9!\nSince the noise h is Gaussian, white, with strength D, and\nhas zero mean, the probability functional P@h# has the form\nexp2(1\/4D)*dt h2(t). A naive substitution of Eq. ~9! into\nthis expression is sufficient to give the correct functional\nform for P@x# to leading order in D, namely,\nP@x#5J@x#exp2A@x#\/D , ~10!\nwhere\nA@x#5S@x#\/v04 , D5D\/v04 ~11!\nandA@x#5 14E2\u2018\n\u2018\ndtH @x\u02d9 1V8~x !#\n1\n2G\nv0\n2 @x\n\u00a8 1x\u02d9 V9~x !#\n1\nv0\n2 @ x^ 1x\n\u00a8 V9~x !1x\u02d9 2V-~x !#J 2.\n~12!\nHaving discussed the reformulation of the problem expressed\nas the Langevin equation ~3! as a Fokker-Planck equation or\nas a path integral, we are now in a position to discuss the\nD\u21920 asymptotics. In the case of the Fokker-Planck equa-\ntion one may perform a WKB-like analysis, while in the case\nof the path-integral one may evaluate Eq. ~7! by steepest\ndescents, the paths which dominate the integral being those\nfor which\ndA@x#\ndx\n50. ~13!\nFrom Eq. ~12! it can be seen that a sixth-order nonlinear\ndifferential equation is obtained. The solutions of this equa-\ntion, subject to the appropriate boundary conditions are the\ninstantons or optimal paths xc(t) of the model. Substituting\nthis solution back into the action gives a number S[S@xc#\n5v0\n4A@xc# . In either case, the WKB treatment or the steep-\nest descent evaluation of the path integral, an analysis of the\nconditional probability ~7! leads to a rate of escape from one\npotential well to another which has the characteristic form\nN exp2S\/D, where N will be termed the prefactor. In the\nratchet we are interested in the current j which is propor-\ntional to the difference between the rates of escape from a\nparticular potential well to the neighboring wells on the right\nand on the left. It is therefore reasonable that it should have\nthe form @2#\nj5l@N1exp~2S1 \/D !2N2exp~2S2\/D !# , ~14!\nwhere the plus and minus symbols denote right and leftward\ntransitions respectively and l is the well spacing.\nIn the next section we will calculate the actions in Eq.\n~14!, by solving the sixth order equation obtained from Eq.\n~13!, numerically. However, in order to get some intuition\nfor what may happen we will end this section by assuming\nthat v0 is large ~compared to the scale set by the curvature of\nthe potential at the bottom of the wells! and obtaining the\naction as a power series in v0\n22\n. In order to do this, we first\nrewrite the noise correlator ~5! in the generic form\nC21~v!5v0\n4@11k1t2v21k2t4v4# , ~15!\nwhere\nt5v0\n21\n, k1522S 12 2G2\nv0\n2 D , k251. ~16!\nWith the form ~15!, the action for a path, starting at the\nbottom of a well at x5a and ending at the top of an adjacent\nbarrier at x5b , is given by @14#\n142 PRE 61M. ARRAYA\u00b4 S et al.A[A@xc#5E\na\nb\ndx V81k1t2E\na\nb\ndx V8~V9!2\n1k2t\n4E\na\nb\ndx V8@~V9!21V8V-#2\n2k1\n2t4E\na\nb\ndx~V8!3~V-!21O~t6!. ~17!\nThe O(t6) terms are also known, they are given in Ref. @14#,\nand are proportional to k1\n3 and k1k2.\nFirst of all, suppose that the spectrum is sharply peaked,\nv0\n2@2G2, then both k1 and k2 have magnitudes of order\none. In this case the expansion ~17! is simply one in powers\nof t25v0\n22\n. The O(t2) corrections are necessary, otherwise\nA simply depends on the height of the barrier DV\n5*a\nbdxV8(x) and the asymmetry of the potential does not\nmanifest itself. An interesting special case is when v0 is\nlarge, but v0\n252G2. Then k1 is zero, and the second and\nfourth terms on the right hand side of Eq. ~17! vanish, as do\nall of the O(t6) terms. So in this case\nA5DV1t4E\na\nb\ndx V8@~V9!21V8V-#2\n1O~t8! @for v0\n252G2# . ~18!\nIf there were no O(t4) terms, it would be the case that when\nv0\n252G2, the action only depended on the barrier height, and\nso if the height of the barrier was the same to the right or to\nthe left, we should not expect any net current. Moreover, if\nwe plot the spectrum of the noise, for the particular value of\nv0\n252G2, we can see that it is very flat: the particle effec-\ntively is feeling a white noise which gives no ratchet effect at\nall. Since there are O(t4) corrections in Eq. ~18!, this is not\nquite so however. In order to investigate this point in a little\nmore detail, we have calculated the integrals in Eq. ~17! @and\nEq. ~18!# using V(x) given in Eq. ~2!. We find\nA65a6(1)1a6(2)k1t21a6(3)k2t42a6(4)k12t41O~t6!,\n~19!\nwhere the coefficients a6\n(i) are given in Table I.\nLet us focus on the particular values v0510.5 and v0\n531.6 which we will use later.

We shall discuss\nthe interpretation of the point where the actions for the left-\nand right-moving transitions become equal in more detail in\nthe concluding section.\nIV. CALCULATION OF LEADING CONTRIBUTION\nIn this section we calculate the leading small D contribu-\ntions S6 ~or alternatively the leading small D contributions\nA6) to the current j in Eq. ~7! for the case of the potential\n~2!. In the preceding section we illustrated the general idea\nby evaluating these actions for large v0, but a general ana-\nlytic treatment is not possible and we will have to resort to a\nnumerical calculation of their values. From Eq. ~12!, the gen-\neral form of the action functional is\nA@x#5E\nt0\nt\ndt L~x\u02d9 ,x\u00a8 , x^ ;t !. ~20!\nThe variation ~13! leads to an Euler-Lagrange equation of\nsixth order\n(j50\n3\n~21 ! j\nd j\ndt j S ]L]x ( j)D 50, ~21!\nwhere x ( j)[d jx\/dt j. A numerical solution will involve the\ndecomposition of this equation into six first-order differential\nequations. A systematic procedure for achieving this is pro-\nvided by the Hamiltonian formulation for the generalized\nmechanics given by Eqs. ~20! and ~21! @15#.\nIf we carry out this procedure starting from the Lagrang-\nian given by\nL~x ,x\u02d9 ,x\u00a8 , x^ !5\n1\n4 H @x\u02d9 1V8~x !#1 2Gv02 @x\u00a8 1x\u02d9 V9~x !#\n1\n1\nv0\n2 @ x^ 1x\n\u00a8 V9~x !1x\u02d9 2V-~x !#J 2, ~22!\nwe find the following Hamiltonian:\nH~xW ,pW !5p1x21p2x31v0\n4p3\n22p3$v0\n2~x21V8!12G~x3\n1x2V9!1x3V91x2\n2V-%, ~23!\nwhere xW5(x1 ,x2 ,x3) and pW 5(p1 ,p2 ,p3).

Imposing the condition\nthat the variation with time of the action is zero, as before,\nH50, and following previous work @15#, we choose as\nboundary conditions for the \u2018\u2018uphill\u2019\u2019 solution ~going from\nthe bottom to the top of the potential!\nx1~2\u2018!5xmin ,x1~\u2018!5xmax ,\nx2~6\u2018!50, ~32!\nx3~6\u2018!50.\nIn order to solve Eqs. ~26!\u2013~31! in practice we have to trun-\ncate them to a large, but finite, time interval and use the\nboundary conditions\nx1~2T !5xmin ,x1~0 !5xmax ,\nx2~2T !50,x2~0 !50, ~33!\nx3~2T !50,x3~0 !50,\nwhere we have used the time translation invariance of the\nequations.\nThe TWPBVP subroutines developed for solving two-point\nboundary value problem were used @16#. In order to get con-\nvergence we used the following procedures. We linearized\nEqs. ~26!-~31! at the initial point, and changed the boundary\nconditions at that point, perturbing them in the direction of\nthe unstable manifold given by eigenvectors with eigenval-\nues having positive real part. We took as an initial guess a\nstraight line joining the boundary points, and the solution of\nthis modified problem was used as initial guess to the origi-\nnal problem, leading to a solution for the optimal path.\nHaving found this solution, the action\nA5E\n2T\n0\np3\n2dt ~34!\nwas calculated, and to minimize the effect of the cutoff effect\nwe added the correction from integrating the linear expres-sions on the boundaries from 2\u2018 to 2T and from 0 to \u2018 .\nWhen T is chosen to be large enough, the result is indepen-\ndent of its value.\nThe results of this calculation will be discussed in Sec. VI\nwhere they will be compared to the simulations that we have\nalso carried out on this problem. We now turn to a discussion\nof these simulations.\nV. ANALOG AND NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS\nIn this section we study our correlation ratchet using ana-\nlog and digital simulations. We have measured the variation\nof the current with G in two ways: analog simulation experi-\nments on an electronic circuit and Monte-Carlo simulations\non a digital computer.\nThe first of these techniques @17\u201319# involves the build-\ning of an electronic circuit to model the system under study,\nthe application of appropriate forces, and analysis of the re-\nsponse by means of a digital computer. The absence of trun-\ncation errors makes analog simulations especially valuable\nfor use, e.g., with fast oscillating systems where the integra-\ntion time ~the time over which data are accumulated and\nperhaps ensemble-averaged! substantially exceeds the vibra-\ntion period, as occurs with QMN. Digital techniques have the\nadvantage that they can always in principle be made more\naccurate than analog methods, which typically achieve\n2\u20133 % accuracy, but the relative simplicity of analog simu-\nlations and their realism ~being much closer to a real experi-\nment than a digital simulation! represent significant advan-\ntages.\nThe electronic circuit used to model ~3! and ~6! is shown\nas a block diagram in Fig. 4. The lower section is the har-\nmonic oscillator used as a \u2018\u2018filter\u2019\u2019 to convert @8# quasiwhite\nnoise from a feedback shift-register noise generator @20,19#\ninto QMN. The QMN is then applied to the input of the\nupper part of the circuit, which models the ratchet potential\nitself. Although the basis of the circuit is standard @19#, sev-\neral points of detail deserve amplification. The force corre-\nsponding to the trigonometric potential of Eq. ~2! is created\nusing trigonometric identities to write it as\nV8~x !52\n29\n10sin x1cos x2\n4\n3sin x cos x1\n6\n5sin\n3x , ~35!\nso we can build the force using only two AD639 ICs @21#.\nAn inherent limitation of the AD639 IC is that it can only\ntreat a restricted range of angles (6500\u00b0). To prevent its\ninput from straying outside this range, provision is made for\nresetting the circuit using DG303AC @22# switches ~they\nhave not been plotted in the block diagram! @17\u201319#. The\nvoltage in the circuit corresponding to coordinate x was digi-\ntized with a 12-bit Microstar ADC @23#, model DAP 3200a\/\n415. Data analysis exploited the on-board 100 MHz Intel\n486DX coprocessor, which was operated within a MatLab-\nbased PC software system developed by Kaufman @24#.\nThe digital simulations were done using a specialized al-\ngorithm, described in Ref. @8#, which we will briefly recall\nhere. The particular structure of Eqs. ~3! and ~6! poses, in\nprinciple, a problem if a simple minded algorithm is used in\nthe integration: Eq. ~6! is characterized by two time scales\n(v0 and G) and the integration time step ~call it h) used in\nthe\n144 PRE 61M. ARRAYA\u00b4 S et al.FIG. 4. Experimental analog circuit.digital simulations would be chosen in such a way that both\nv0h!1 and Gh!1. Also, if tr is the typical relaxation time\nin Eq. ~3!, we should also satisfy h\/tr!1. This latter in-\nequality, for the typical parameters which are of physical\ninterest, is normally satisfied as soon as the former one is: in\nother words, in a simple minded algorithm the constraint on\nthe integration time step comes from Eq. ~6! rather than from\nEq. ~3!, because the time scales involved by v0 and G are\n~much! smaller than tr . From the point of view of the prob-\nlem we are trying to solve, however, this would not be very\nefficient: we would be using most of the CPU time integrat-\ning the noise equation ~6! rather than integrating the dynami-\ncal equation representing the model under study.\nThe particular structure of Eqs. ~3! and ~6! suggests that a\nspecialized algorithm could be more efficient: the point is\nthat Eq. ~6! is a linear filtering of an uncorrelated Gaussian\nnoise. This means that the output of this equation ~the vari-\nable j) is itself a Gaussian variable, of unknown intensity\nand correlation: hence, it may be possible to integrate Eq. ~3!\ndirectly, working out the appropriate integration algorithm,\nusing the statistical properties of the Gaussian variable j .\nThe algorithm used to integrate Eq. ~3! is the Heun algorithm\n@25# which prescribes that we integrate Eq. ~3! with a couple\nof elementary steps, namely we first predict\nx\u02dc~h !5x~0 !1h@2V8\u0084x~0 !\u0085#1r~h !, ~36!\nand then correct as\nx~h !5$x\u02dc~h !1x~0 !1h@2V8\u0084x\u02dc~h !\u0085#1r~h !%\/2. ~37!\nIn the expression above, we need to evaluate the quantity\nr(h)[*0hj(s)ds , which can be written @8# as\nr~h !5A31j~0 !1A32j\u02d9 ~0 !1w3 , ~38!where\nw35B31z11B32z21B33z3 , ~39!\nand where zi are uncorrelated Gaussian deviates of average\nzero and standard deviation one. Note that the quantity r(h)\nturns out to be a linear combination of Gaussian variables, as\nexpected. Defining V2[v0\n22G2 and l6[2G6AG22v02,\nwe have\nA315\ni\n2V H l2l1 ~ehl121 !2l1l2 ~ehl221 !J , ~40!\nA325\ni\n2V H ehl221l2 2e\nhl121\nl1\nJ . ~41!\nThe expressions for Bi j are very cumbersome, and we refer\nthe reader to Ref. @8#: note that Ref. @8# contains a misprint,\nthe quantity 4pT\/2V2 on the right hand side of Eq. ~A14!\nshould read GT\/V2.\nA warning is in order concerning the random noise gen-\nerator. The noise intensities of interest are fairly small com-\npared to the barrier that the Brownian particle has to over-\ncome to diffuse and generate a net current. It is then of great\nimportance to make sure that the rare activation events are\ncorrectly generated, which implies that the noise generator\nshould be particularly accurate in generating the tails of the\ndistribution. The generator used works by generating a\nGaussian random variable, using the Ziggurath algorithm\n@26#, from flat random distributions obtained with a subtract\nand carry algorithm @27,28#.\nThe actions A6 were calculated from the slope of plotting\nthe logarithm of the mean escape time, calculated as the total\ntime of observation divided by the number of transitions to\nthe left or right, versus 1\/D . The current in the experiments is\nPRE 61 145RATCHET DRIVEN BY QUASIMONOCHROMATIC NOISEeasily obtained by keeping track of the distance moved by\nthe random walker and dividing it by the total simulation\ntime. These results can be observed in the figures.\nVI. ANALYSIS OF RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS\nIn this section we wish to compare the theoretical predic-\ntions of Sec. III, IV with the experiments. Our main aim is to\nunderstand the structure of the current ~14!. This is made up\nof actions S6 and prefactors N6 . For small D, the action\ndominates, so we begin by comparing the actions calculated\nfrom Eq. ~17! with the numerical method discussed in Sec.\nIV. For a typical value of v0510.5, the results are shown in\nFig. 5. This shows reasonable agreement between analytical\nand numerical results of solving the full set of equations of\nSec. IV. This fully justifies the approximation of Sec. III,\nwhich is very useful given the difficulty of carrying out the\nnumerical integrations in the method of Sec. IV.\nNow we are in a position to compare the theoretical pre-\ndictions with the digital simulation of Sec. V. This is shown\nin Fig. 6. The digital simulation shows the same trends as the\nTABLE II.

Nev-\nertheless, the value of G at the point where A15A2 pre-\ndicted by the digital simulations is in reasonable agreement\nwith the theoretical value.\nThe prefactors are, unfortunately, difficult to calculate. In\nfact, a calculation for QMN has not yet been carried out. The\nprefactors are, however, known for white noise and exponen-\ntially correlated noise ~for small noise correlation time @29#!,\nand we use these in the expectation that they are a reasonable\napproximation to the true result. In Fig. 7, the current calcu-\nlated from Eq. ~14! using these prefactors together with an\naction calculated as in Sec. IV, is plotted with the data from\nthe digital simulation. A possible interpretation of the devia-\ntion of the theoretical from the experimental results could be\nthe approximate prefactor. However, it is clear that the ex-\nponentially correlated prefactor is an improvement over the\nwhite noise one, and this suggests that the correct QMN\nprefactor might give even better agreement. In any case, it is\nclearly demonstrated that a ratchet consisting of an asymmet-\nric periodic potential plus quasimonochromatic noise forcing\ncan indeed give rise to a net transport of particles.\nTable II displays the current obtained for v0510.5 in\nboth the analog experiment and the digital simulation.

ARRAYA\u00b4 S et al.case, although actions can be calculated analytically, the pa-\nrameter in the expansion for the prefactor is no longer small\nand one is unable to obtain an analytic expression for the\ncurrent. The values v0510.5 and v0531.6 were chosen for\ntechnical reasons connected with carrying out the analog ex-\nperiment.\nThere is no reason to assume that the current reversal ( j\n50) necessarily occurs when A15A2 , because the prefac-\ntors may cause some deviation from this leading order result.\nHowever, from Fig. 7 and Table II it seems that they do in\nfact occur at the same point \u2014 even though the magnitude of\nthe analog current is consistently less than that of the digital\ncurrent. This may be because, as D\u21920, the action com-\npletely dominates or because the prefactors happen to be\napproximately equal at this point.\nIn the literature, this problem has been already discussed\nin Refs. @2# and @30#. In Ref. @2# it was found that there is\nindeed a net current in the system, and, working in the limit\nof small G\/v0, the authors were able to show that the sign of\nthe current changes as the curvature at v50 @i.e., C9(0)]\nchanges with varying G . In Ref. @30# the authors considered\na model of the form ~3!, but with an additional white noise.\nHowever, as we have seen, there is no need to introduce an\nadditional noise of this type in order to see a current reversal.The authors found that the current should change sign for at\nleast two different values of G .\nOur aim has been to study how the current changed as the\nnoise parameters G and v0 varied, for finite G\/v0. We found\nthat that the change in the spectral density curvature at v\n50 mentioned above is still the main effect in determining\nthe current direction, in agreement with Ref. @2#. We have\nincluded in the theoretical treatment higher order terms in\nG\/v0: our result coincides with the result of Ref. @2# in the\nappropriate limit, with a small shift in the transition point if\nG\/v0 is finite. The simulations which were carried out sup-\nport the theoretical conclusions. We have not observed more\nthan one current reversal experimentally ~with fixed v0 and\nvarying G), but examination of Eq. ~19! shows that there is\nanother solution @to O(t4)] for which A15A2 . It would be\ninteresting to explore this regime in more detail experimen-\ntally.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful to M. I.
