Surprisingly,\nit revealed that many issues surrounding Supply Chain Management implementation were\nsimilar to those found in \u2018normal\u2019 markets and that it played an important part in reducing the\ninherently negative effects of monopolistic relationships. The research sheds new and useful\nlight on the dynamics of this unusual business situation for both managers and academics.\nKeywords: Supply Chain Management, Monopoly, UK Defence Procurement\nIntroduction\nFollowing the ending of the \u2018Cold War\u2019 in 1989, the UK Government has sought a \u2018peace\ndividend\u2019 through a reduction in expenditure on defence. However, continued participation\nin international conflicts and peace-keeping operations has required qualitative improvements\nto military capability to be maintained. With equipment expenditure of \u00a310,408 million in\n2000\/01 (DASA, 2002) this is still a strategically important element of UK Government\nspending and as with other public sector areas, a relentless drive to achieve greater value for\nmoney has been pursued. A crucial element of this strategy has been to overcome traditional\nadversarial attitudes which have resulted in a succession of high-profile cost, time and project\nperformance overruns. The intention has been to establish long-term supply chain\npartnerships with its industrial suppliers. However, in the face of global spending cutbacks\nthe continued concentration of the Defence Equipment Suppliers has resulted in an\nincreasingly monopolistic situation. This is a very high technology business dealing with\npolitically sensitive, limited availability goods and services in relationships that extend over\nmany years. Each side wields considerable power but, lack of trust and the option to leave\nreduce efficiency, increase costs and offer little incentive to co-operate (Humphries &\nWilding, 2001, Palmer, 2001, Parker & Hartley 1997). Moreover, despite clear strategic\n4intentions, the practical implementation of partnering arrangements by the UK Ministry of\nDefence (MoD) have been slow, patchy and clouded by uncertainty over ways and means.\nFurthermore, the fundamental differences of aims by both sides appear to make the selection\nof common objectives difficult and problematic. Overcoming these difficulties is the\nbusiness problem currently faced by UK MoD\u2019s Logistics teams and their industrial suppliers\nas they attempt to create and manage complex supply chains delivering military spare parts,\nrepairs and design services to UK military forces world-wide.\nThis paper thus explores the role of Supply Chain Management (SCM) in the unusual\ndomain of long-term, monopolistic business-to-business relationships. We first examine\nviews from the literature, describe the difficult task of selecting an appropriate theoretical\nframework and then describe a substantial research project carried out in the UK Defence\nProcurement Organisation which employs both quantitative and qualitative methods. It\nconcludes from emergent supply chain relationship factors that the importance of SCM in\n\u2018normal\u2019 markets is replicated in the monopolistic relationships surveyed although, specific\nadverse characteristic features are also revealed which may have parallels within the long-\nterm collaborative relationships found in other sectors. We believe this offers practitioners\nuseful guidance and academics with opportunities for further research.\nSupply Chain Relationships\nAs already mentioned, the business of UK Defence Procurement is essentially the\nmanagement of supply chain relationships which accords with Tompkins (2000): to achieve\nby co-operation \u2018the synchronisation of the physical flow of goods from sourcing to\nconsumption\u2019. In our brief review of the literature we therefore concentrate on the\nimportance of relationships to SCM and compare the private and public sectors. Our aim is\nto expose the main dynamics in order to seek parallels with the research environment.\n5SCM is viewed as an integrative, proactive approach to managing the total flow of a\ndistribution channel to the ultimate customer (Matthyssens & Van den Bulte, 1994). It aims\nto increase customer service reliability and reduce inventory (Boddy et al, 2000) to lower\nuncertainty and costs (Cooper & Ellram, 1993, Lamming, 1993, Bechtel & Jayaranth, 1997).\nIt therefore depends upon co-operative relationships throughout the Supply Chain in order to\nachieve benefits for all participants (Stevens, 1989) and this involves closer relationships\nbetween members which include trust, commitment and collaboration (Spekman et al, 1998).\nThe literature contains a great deal of holistic advice on how this should be achieved but, in\npractice it is generally operationalised as the integration of chains of suppliers to better satisfy\ncustomers (Christopher, 1997, Peck et al, 2000). Nevertheless, although suppliers recognise\nthe need to integrate with their customers, it is apparent that full SCM implementation is not\nbeing achieved for a number of reasons (Spekman et al, 1998). The importance of long-term\npartnering relationships to focussing on complex, problem solving (Hulme, 1997) is\nacknowledged. But, the need to base these arrangements on openness, shared risks and\nrewards that leverage the skills of each partner to achieve competitive performance not\nachieved by the individual, is a step that firms find difficult to take (Lambert et al, 1996).\nMany are still taking a short-term view which tends them towards adversarial relationships\n(Braithwaite, 1998) and the development of partnering relationships is being obstructed by\npoor communications allied to reluctance to accept attitudinal change (Anscombe & Kearney,\n1994). Nevertheless, the obligational nature of these arrangements to overcome opportunistic\ntemptations is evident (Ellram & Edis, 1996) as is the importance of achieving good\nbusiness-to-business relationships through partnering as a foundation for achieving the\noperational benefits of SCM (Cooper et al, 1997). We conclude that increased pressures from\ncustomers in a more globalised business environment have forced commercial companies to\nadopt closer relationships with their strategic partners but this demands a substantial\n6investment in new management skills and cultural adaptation. UK Defence Procurement\nsupply chain relationships are similarly long termed, inextricably linked and characterised by\ncomplex problems and moreover, being also driven by global market conditions\n(concentration) and increased customer (MoD) sophistication to change (Humphries &\nWilding, 2001).\nThe review up to this point has predominantly concentrated on concepts developed in the\nprivate sector but in comparison, relatively little research has examined SCM within the\npublic sector (Harland et al, 2000). Networking theory considers focal firms but not the\nlarger systems of public sector supply and, describes important context variables but does not\nconsider regulation. Porter\u2019s (1980) strategic management framework focuses on individual\nfirm\u2019s vertical integration strategies compared to their competitors but does not consider the\nnon-competitive aspects of the private sector. All offer some generalisable features that are\nrelevant but no one model or framework comprehensively addresses public sector SCM\nrelationships (Harland et al, 2000, Zheng, 1998). Harland et al (2000) in their UK Health\nAuthority research list the following distinctive features of public sector supply chain\norganisations: large and specific services; remote customers; stakeholders are complex,\ndifficult to integrate and crucial to success; dedicated market suppliers; reduced availability\nof alternatives; accountability to national interest rather than shareholders; the government\nmakes the rules and can sanction anti-competitiveness; investment cycles are long compared\nto annual reports and returns on investment and finally, the government theme is dominated\nby politics. These factors are confirmed by Brooks & Pawar\u2019s (2000) research which also\nconcluded that the public sector is different and that the correlation with commercial supply\nchain relationships cannot be taken as straight forward. However, given that SCM aims to\nmanage a limited number of complex business-to-business relationships over a longer term,\n7there are some fundamental similarities of principle that seem to apply (Humphries &\nWilding, 2000).\nIn conclusion, the importance of improving relationships to achieve successful SCM\nimplementation appears to be well known to academia and business alike and, after more\nthan a decade, is still actively pursued as a strategy by the private and public sectors (Bectel\n& Jayaram, 1997, Brooks & Pawar, 2000, Cooper et al, 1997). The literature has highlighted\na number of success and failure factors in the private sector and in more limited coverage of\nthe public sector, identified that similar business motivations exist but are complicated by\nenvironmental and stakeholder factors. Although these criteria are useful to this research, a\nsignificant gap exists when considering the very long, monopolistic supply chain\nrelationships of the type found within UK Defence Procurement (Humphries & Wilding,\n2001). It is intended that our research would help to fill this void.\nA Theoretical Framework for Research\nA lack of research on business relationships within sustained monopolies hampered the\nsearch for an appropriate model through which to view UK Defence Procurement\nrelationships. Both Porter\u2019s (1980) Five Forces and Cox et al\u2019s (2000) Relation Power\nAnalysis considered competition-limiting strategies but appeared to be optimised for use in\n\u2018normal\u2019 markets. However, Williamson's (1975) Economic Organisations Failure\nFramework shown in Figure 1 appeared to offer a viable theoretical model for research\nbecause it describes a stylised situation in a complex inter-organisational relationship where\nthe costs of managing the risk associated with human factors such as opportunism become\ntoo high, the \u2018market\u2019 breaks down and forces a firm to internalise the business, in effect\ncreating an internal monopoly. It is thus possible to hypothesise that within a sustained\nmonopoly of the type found within UK Defence Procurement where neither side has the\n8opportunity to escape, the lack of incentive to co-operate might help to perpetuate an\nadversarial relationship characterised by the features within the boxes of Figure 1 (Humphries\n& Wilding, 2000). In this situation the sides do the minimum necessary under the terms of\nthe contract, they take short-term decisions which may cost more in the long-run, because of\nlack of trust they are reluctant to share proprietary information and may even deliberately\ndistort disclosures such as inflating cost figures in order to justify higher prices, they will\nopportunistically seek their own objectives rather than and at the expense or joint ones and\nfinally, lack of trust will promote a reliance on the small print of the contract which limits\nflexibility and adds cost. Examples of these adverse features are certainly portrayed by the\npress as a tradition of UK Defence Procurement (Humphries & Wilding, 2000) although it\nshould be noted that Williamson (1975) described the arrows in the framework as\n\u2018influences within an environment\u2019 rather than a causal interactions. We thus decided to use\nFigure 1 as a research model because it appeared to describe a recognisable view of the\nBounded\nRationality\nUncertainty\/\nComplexity\nInformation\nImpactedness\nOpportunism Small Numbers\nonly do what you\ncan control\ndeliberately\nconfuse your\npartner\nthe partners are\ntrapped by\nlimited choices\neveryone focuses\non his own\nobjectives\ntake a short term\nview and avoid\nrisks\nFigure 1.

The aim our research was\nto test this model by seeking empirical evidence of strength and character of each of its 5\ndimensions within the relationships examined.\nIn conclusion, there has been considerable transaction cost economics research which has\ninvestigated interorganisational relationships and public utility monopolies but, it has not\nbeen well-integrated and no study has utilised Williamson\u2019s (1975) Organisations Failure\nFramework in its entirety (Rindfleisch & Heide, 1997). This research therefore proposed to\nexploit this gap whilst examining UK Defence Procurement business relationships.\nMethodology - Measuring Relationship Characteristics\nThe research aims were thus to understand the relationship dynamics within long-term,\ncollaborative businesses and to determine if relational success factors found within SCM such\nas trust and collaborative working arrangements were able to assist UK Defence Procurement\nmanagers to break out of the essentially negative situation represented by Figure 1. An\nexploratory research project was designed which used the key informant methods of surveys\n(600 staff questionnaires \u2013 5 point Likert scales) supported by 115 team-leader semi-\nstructured interviews. It took a wide, cross-sectional perspective in order to make a statement\nabout the outcomes of broadly comparable experiences using numerical supporting evidence.\nThe questionnaire questions listed at Appendix 1 were selected from a pool based in the\nliterature and grouped to correspond with the 5 theoretical framework dimensions. On the\npremise that UK Defence supply chains might contain a spectrum of business relationships,\nthe opposites of the negative definitions of Williamson\u2019s (1975) framework were used to\nlabel the groups and, questions with a positive orientation were used (validated by focus\ngroups of practitioners during the research pilot phase).\n10\nA self-selected census, (where the MoD managers chose the relationships to be\nresearched), of 54 monopolistic, two-party relationships representing \u00a3575.8m annual spend\nwithin the UK Defence Procurement Organisation (a 10% sample by value) allowed the\ncollection and analysis of large quantities of data to determine the range and strength of\nfactors within the conceptual framework. It was acknowledged that such a sample could\ngenerate skewed results however, follow-up analysis indicated a wide cross-section of the\nDefence Logistics Organisation businesses in terms of size, spend and maturity participated\nwhich led us to believe that sample bias could be ignored. These businesses procured very\nhigh technology, military equipment spare parts, repair and engineering design services and\neach team was composed of engineers, procurement, finance and commercial staffs. The\nproject also took a relational perspective in identifying the main types of interaction and thus\nincluded data collection by qualitative methods in order to capture the richness of perceptions\nneeded to gain insight into the subtleties and cultural depth of the business problem. The\nmethod employed was to survey as many and as wide a cross-section of the team members in\neach pair of businesses as possible and to record and manipulate the results in Microsoft\nExcel spreadsheets. Once the team-leaders had studied the results, each was interviewed\nseparately to determine the perceived reasons for the statistical results. Over 700 key points\nwere selected from the semi-structured interviews and stored in a Microsoft Access database\nand organised for analysis by theoretical dimension, supply chain characteristics and\nrelationship. Special attention was devoted to providing feedback to the research participants\nby means of individual relationship reports as well as head office and web-based summaries\nof the research findings. The production of independent, frank relationship information was\nhighly valued by the organisations involved and in many cases relationship maintenance\narrangements received a much-needed boost as a result.\n11\nAn innovative data analysis approach was adopted which allowed the quantitative results\nto reveal the broad statistical trends, the qualitative results to reveal the richness of the\nbusiness interactions and, a means of relating both back to the theoretical framework. This is\nshown in Appendix 2 where each dimension is first defined and its mean satisfaction score\nfrom the quantitative data is given. Then, within emergent qualitative data groupings,\nexample semi-structured interview key points are used to illustrate the strengths of\nrespondent\u2019s feelings. The next Section provides conclusions from this data.\nRelationship Dynamics - Findings\nDimension 1 - Relationship Creativity. The overall mean satisfaction score of 59% was\ngenerally supported by the tone of the qualitative data. In summary, successful relationships\noccurred when innovative contracts existed which reduced costs and promoted customer\nfocus. Moreover, organisational arrangements that promoted consistency and performance\nimprovements were also valued. However, it appeared that both deliberate and unconscious\nexpediency often came into play that reduced relationship effectiveness (people have only so\nmuch capacity to rationalise what is going on around them and they therefore naturally limit\ntheir performance to the adequate rather than the optimum (Simon, 1957)).\nDimension 2 \u2013 Relationship Stability. Forward-looking, holistic partnering arrangements\nsupported by customer-focussed, supply chain-bolstering activities were detected. With a\nmean satisfaction rating of 51% however, there were a similar number of instances of\nnegative approaches such as insular practices, disruptive organisational changes and short-\nterm strategies that promoted rather than countered the adverse effects of uncertainty and\ncomplexity (Williamson, 1975).\nDimension 3 \u2013 Communication. Although the mean satisfaction rating was only just above\nparity at 51%, practitioners\u2019 comments were generally positive. Overall the importance of\n12\nSupply Chain communication was understood and efforts were being made to improve but,\nthere were very few examples where full supply chain integration could be demonstrated.\nSome instances of information impactedness (the imbalance caused by selective information\ndisclosures, and distortions which are difficult or expensive to verify at the time and which\nundermine the durability of contract arrangements (Williamson, 1975)) were detected and\nlinked directly to a feeling of powerlessness due to the monopolistic situation. But, the\npractical difficulties of providing regular, management focus on order book performance\nthrough the use of joint performance measurement and service level systems appeared to be\nthe key issues.\nDimension 4 - Relationship Reliability. This dimension had the lowest mean satisfaction\nscore of 49% which indicated that the practical implementation of SCM was considered to be\ndifficult. A number of positive SCM aspects such as striving to improve quality ethos,\nservice delivery and process improvement were observed in the data. However,\nenvironmental limitations on time, budget and investment and, product technical complexity\nand age had a strong bearing on the monopolistic business environment under scrutiny. It is\nevident that instances of opportunistic behaviour (a lack of candour or honesty and includes\nself-interest seeking with guile (Williamson, 1979)) were prompted as reactions to these\nfeatures.\nDimension 5 \u2013 Relationship Quality. This dimension achieved the highest mean satisfaction\nscore of 66%. However, the qualitative data gave a generally more pessimistic impression\nalthough managers generally felt that they had no option but to try and make the best of their\nsituation. There appeared to be clear evidence of working together in the best interests of\nrelationships but, in many cases the sides felt trapped and at the mercy of the other sides\u2019\nbudgetary, commercial and bureaucratic vagaries. In a small numbers situation, the parties\n13\ncould resort to countering problematic behaviours, including lack of trust, by providing\nincreasingly sophisticated controls that could, by reducing managers\u2019 freedom of action\nprecipitate a further reduction of trust and a negative cycle of reactions (Williamson, 1979).\nDiscussion of Results\nContrary to expectations, a diversity of positive, business-driven behaviours as well as more\nadverse monopolistic dynamics were present within the UK Defence Procurement\nenvironment. The mean satisfaction scores by dimension from the quantitative data findings\nshown in Figure 2 usefully revealed that the essentially negative Organisations Failure\nFramework was not so in practice with an overall success rating of 57%.\nThese findings are borne out by the data described in the previous section. Difficulties in\nachieving effective SCM implementation could be traced to the normal, commercial\ndifficulties surrounding order book performance, joint objectives and service level systems\nframework (Humphries & Wilding, 2004, Lamming, 1993, Tompkins, 2000).

Overall Conceptual Framework Results by Dimension\n14\nproblems such as old products, obsolescence, staff and organisational upheavals, poor end-\ncustomer visibility and lack of investment in modern procedures and systems seemed to\naccentuate managers\u2019 frustrations due to lack of freedom of action and promoted the\nrelationship negativity implied by the theoretical framework. As predicted by the model, lack\nof investment in specific assets such as work force stability and product\/process\ndevelopment, the use of inadequate performance measures, opportunistically providing poor\ngoods and services and, using proprietary information as a weapon, reduced the chances of\nachieving interdependence and equitable outcomes. On the other hand despite the adverse\nmonopolistic influences, strong counterbalancing, positive business drivers were able to\nproduce examples of relationship-building, specific investments, co-operative behaviour,\nopen communications and a desire to reduce the burden of governance through more\nequitable, long-term arrangements.\nAlthough the research was designed to take an aggregate view of the data and did not\ndifferentiate between the views of the MoD and Industry respondents, it was noticeable that\nqualitative opinions were reasonably balanced. However, quantitatively MoD staffs were\nless optimistic (59%) than Industry (67%). Statistical analysis indicates that this difference is\nnot significant with a high correlation factor of 0.928 (Sapsford, 1999). From the data\ncollected no explanation could be found for the difference in perception but further research\ninto the phenomenon might prove interesting.\nThis research aimed to provide an understanding of the supply chain relationship\ndynamics within long-term, collaborative businesses of the type found within UK Defence\nProcurement and, to provide managers in this environment with some pointers on successful\npartnering within monopolistic businesses. The findings have exposed the reasons for\ntensions within the MoD\/Industry relationships and described the success factors that appear\n15\nto prevail in the face of the potential difficulties described in Figure 1. Some advice for\npractitioners is given later but next we describe the implications for theory.\nImplications for Theory\nWilliamson\u2019s (1975) Organisations Failure Framework was selected as the theoretical model\nbecause it appeared to provide a means of examining the relational dynamics within a\nsustained monopolistic business. Because the business focus was collaborative supply chain\nmanagement, the relational aspects of SCM were used as the theoretical field with which\nexpose the interactions between the pairs of business partners using an exploratory research\nmethodology. From the emergent groupings of qualitative data reinforced by the quantitative\nsatisfaction ratings revealed by the questionnaires it was found that despite the forced\npartnership monopolistic situation, the process efficiency aims of SCM as found in \u2018normal\u2019\nmarkets were present. Also, although considerable efforts were being devoted to improving\nSCM performance, in concert with Spekman et al\u2019s (1998) commercial sector findings,\nsuccessfully implemented examples were difficult to achieve. However, negative behaviour\nsymptomatic of the theoretical monopoly environment was also prominent. This included\nevidence of managers\u2019 frustration at the lack of freedom of action where relationship\n\u2018carelessness\u2019 destroyed trust (Macbeth & Ferguson, 1994). Lambert et al\u2019s (1996)\nPartnering process model demonstrates the important features that impact upon partners when\nestablishing and maintaining a partnership and describes a continuous improvement approach\nwith the reinforcement of success. Under monopolistic conditions the partners have no\nchoice in the arrangement and depending on the degree of negativity affecting the business\ndrivers for co-operation and the facilitators deployed to operationalise the relationship will,\nthrough a negative feedback loop, potentially generate a self-reinforcing, low quality\nrelationship (Humphries & Wilding, 2004). We conclude that these findings support\n16\nWilliamson\u2019s (1975) concepts when applied to sustained, public sector, monopolistic,\nbusiness relationships and moreover, provide additional evidence that builds upon Spekman\net al\u2019s (1998) work in addressing the reasons why SCM relationships are difficult to\nimplement and sustain.\nAdvice for Practitioners\nAs mentioned in the introduction to this paper, UK Defence Procurement relationships are\nextremely important to both national and industrial policies such that any improvements in\nperformance is likely to be extremely beneficial to all concerned. This research has taken an\ninnovative approach to the analysis of this important situation and as a result has highlighted\na primary lesson for managers operating within these sustained monopolies. If they are to\nachieve the Government\u2019s demand for improved value for money in UK Defence spending\nthrough partnering relationships with industry there is a prime need to accept that the\nmonopoly environment will inevitably reduce relationship quality due to the limited\navailability of options for action. Allowing frustration and generate negative behaviours to\nenter a negative cycle only results in poor returns for both sides. On the contrary, it is\nessential to build an inventory of environmental problems that are normally considered to be\n\u2018unavoidable features of the business\u2019 and jointly seek innovative ways of dealing with them.\nSynchronised objectives, pursuing joint approaches to service and product delivery, lowering\ncosts and risks and promoting measures to support the growth of trust appear to be the best\nways of mitigating the negative influences of the endemic monopoly situation on supply\nchain relationships. Finally, the research has proved the benefit of an independent, 3rd party\nreview of supply chain relationship development and suggests that periodic repeats would\nallow areas for joint management attention to be targeted.\n17\nFurther Research Opportunities\nThis research has, for the first time achieved a high level, cross-relationship (UK\nMoD\/Industry) perspective of a significant sample of sustained monopoly businesses and this\nsupply chain activity continues to struggle to achieve its objectives in a market that becomes\nmore and more restricted. Further research is necessary to build on our initial, exploratory\nefforts in order to probe more deeply into an extremely interesting area. It would be useful to\nrepeat the approach in order to obtain a longitudinal view of the relationships to determine\nwhat change is occurring over time and why and provide more detailed understanding of the\norganisational and personal interactions. Such an approach could be aimed at providing more\nspecific improvement programmes and be targeted both tactically and strategically.\nTraditionally economics has taken a rather limited view of monopoly in areas such as the\ngovernance arrangements for public utilities or the application of anti-trust legislation\n(Rindfleisch & Heide, 1997). This research echoes Parker and Hartley\u2019s conclusions that\neconomists might also find the examination of \u2018public interest\u2019 monopolies interesting.\nLastly, there are possible similarities between the UK Defence monopolistic supply chain\nrelationships and long term collaborations in the private sector. Not only would the repeat of\nour research approach in the commercial arena, both nationally and internationally,\ntriangulate our findings but it might also offer researchers another way of cross-tabulating\ntheir own projects. It should be emphasised that none of these opportunities for research\nshould be viewed in isolation; many of them overlap and converge to offer the chance to\ncarry out integrated research programmes.\nConclusion\nThe literature suggests that the little known about the relationship dynamics within\nmonopolies presupposes negative outcomes. However, this research has shown that this is\n18\nnot the case, and that within the relationships examined a spectrum of positive and negative\nresults were found. This is especially interesting because it demonstrates that Supply Chain\nManagement factors, as described in \u2018normal\u2019 markets literature, are equally important\nsuccess factors in monopolistic business. The research findings thus shed new light in an\narea that has received little attention by management researchers (Palmer, 2001, Parker &\nHartley, 1997). They also provide valuable practical advice to managers and offer academics\na potentially interesting agenda for future research to gain extended perspectives of long-\nterm, collaborative, supply chain relationships.\n19\nAppendix 1 \u2013 Questionnaire Dimensions and Questions\n1.
