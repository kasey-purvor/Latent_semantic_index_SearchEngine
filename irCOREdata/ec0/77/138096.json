Dunn, C P Shaw, Z Huang and R. W. Whatmore \nBuilding 70 (Nanotechnology) Cranfield University, Cranfield, MK43 0AL, UK. \n \nAbstract \n \nPiezoForce Microscopy (PFM) has been used to determine the domain structure of lead \nzirconate titanate (PZT) (30\/70) on an Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)\/Glass substrate with a \nTiO2 boundary layer. The PZT nucleates into the perovskite form in a random \ncrystallographic manner, which leads to a random domain structure in the final film. \nUsing PFM it has been possible to visualise the domain structure of the PZT and \ndetermine that the domain structure has features as fine as 8nm herringbone patterns. The \npossible impact of these structures for future devices utilising nanoscale features of PZT \nand especially FeRAM developments is highlighted. \n \n \nHere we report the use of an SPM (scanning probe microscope), modified to perform \nPFM (piezoresponse force microscopy), to visualise the domain structure in PZT 30\/70 \n(lead zirconate titanate 30\/70) thin films with nanometric resolution and the possible \nimpacts for ferroelectric memories. The use of ferroelectric thin film materials as the \nstorage medium in memory devices is not a new phenomenon [1-4] The potential \nadvantages of using the ferroelectric layer to store data was first highlighted during the \n1950\u2019s with work continuing up to the present day [5, 6]. Further development of non-\n2volatile memory devices for use in information technology applications is becoming \nincreasingly reliant on the ability to produce high quality ferroelectric thin films [7, 8]. A \nthorough understanding of their behaviour at the nanoscopic level is essential if we are to \nunderstand the problems of retention and fatigue associated with many ferroelectric \nmaterials when applied to memory devices.  The use of PFM to study and manipulate the \ndomain structure of a ferroelectric materials at nanometric resolution has been widely \nreported [9-12]. Here we show that it is possible to image features as fine as 8nm in the \ndomain structure of PZT 30\/70 films deposited on ITO (indium tin oxide) coated glass \nand that the domain structure in the PZT is not homogeneously distributed. \n \nUsing the polarisation state of a ferroelectric material it was proposed that a device with a \nvery fast access time and low power consumption, could be manufactured [13]. However, \nwhen such devices were produced they suffered from excessive fatigue[2, 14], i.e. reduced \nability to store charge upon subsequent cycling. Two broad solutions have been \ninvestigated to reduce the fatigue demonstrated by the device. These are the use of \noxygen donating electrodes[15-18] such as ITO or RuO2 or substituting the ferroelectric \nlayer for a so-called \u2018fatigue free\u2019 ferroelectric material[19-21]. Fatigue free materials have \nproved difficult to grow in an orientation suitable for use as the capacitor layer in Fe-\nRAM devices [21]. It is possible to produce ferroelectric material, such as PZT, on \noxygen donating electrodes such as iridium\/iridium oxide or ruthenium oxide. The \nresulting ferroelectric layer can be too \u2018leaky\u2019 (the charge stored leaks away rather than \nremaining in the memory cell) for use in non-volatile applications. However, the \ndeposition of PZT onto ITO coated glass has been shown to increase the fatigue life of \nPZT [22] and has been attributed to the ability of the ITO to behave in a non-blocking \n3way to charged defects by conducting anions. Previous investigations have concentrated \non determining the fatigue properties of the films using devices such as the Radiant \nTechnologies RT66A and \u2018Fatigue\u2019 software (further information can be found at \nhttp:\/\/www.ferrodevices.com\/vision.html#mt). These studies have derived information \nregarding the fatigue and ferroelectric properties of the material on a micro-meter scale. \nBy using PFM and intermittent contact mode SPM we have determined that there are \nsignificant variations in the domain structure of the PZT below this scale and that these \ndomains vary from region to region across the film surface. \n \nOur films were prepared by spin coating a sol of PZT pre-cursor materials to produce a \nfilm 70nm thick. The PZT film was \u201cdried\u201d at 450\u00baC and annealed at 570\u00baC for 20 \nminutes producing a fully-perovskite film. A full discussion of the nature of the \nnucleation, the effect this has on the topography and the crystallography of the film is \ngiven by Shaw et al [23, 24].A Digital Instruments Dimension 3000 SPM was modified \nto perform PFM, shown schematically in Figure 1. An oscillating AC signal at 17.68kHz \nand 1.5 V peak to peak was applied between the SPM tip and the back electrode (held at \nground) across the PZT sample. This induces a converse piezoelectric effect in the PZT \nthin film with the resulting signal being detected by a lock-in amplifier (EG+G, 7260) \nand used to generate the PFM domain map. For further information regarding the \ntechnique of PFM, it\u2019s history, usefulness, physical interactions that govern the response \nof the cantilever and methods of data analysis the reader is directed to the following \nreferences[11, 25-33]. The SPM tips used for these experiments were Nanosensors \n4Electrostatic Force Microscopy tips coated in PtIr with a resonant frequency around 270 \nkHz. All PFM experiments were performed in contact mode. \n \nA topographic image for the region investigated is shown in Figure 2. This indicates that \nthe PZT has not grown into a smooth layer. Individual plates have formed during \ncrystallisation of the pyrochlore phase into the perovskite phase, resulting in the surface \ntopography seen. Within each of the large plates (2-5\u03bcm across) individual crystallites of \nPZT can be seen as small bumps on the surface of the sample. A PFM image for the same \nregion is shown in Figure 3. The plate boundaries are easily seen as well as the large \nvariation in the contrast in the image.  \n \nThe PFM technique maps the domain structure of the material by detecting the phase \nshift in the converse piezoelectric effect for oppositely poled regions in the film. When a \nfilm has been deposited by a sol-gel technique it usual and indeed thermodynamically \npredicted that the domain structure of the surface will have a zero net polarization. This is \nachieved by the surface of the film having a random orientation of domains that add to \ngive a net neutral surface. If the film was poled in one direction, for example, with the \nspontaneous dipole up then the image produced would be all white. The variation in \ncontrast across the image indicates that the domains, and hence crystal structure, in the \nas-deposited material are not homogeneously orientated. If the structure of the material \nwas homogeneously orientated, i.e. a [111] or [100] psudo-epitaxal structure, then the \nimage would contain only regions of black and white, with no gray or grayscale areas. \nThis finding is supported by the XRD pattern for the sample, which is similar to that of \n5the powder pattern for PZT [24] indicating that the crystallographic orientation in the \nfilm is not constrained to one orientation. This result means that the PZT grown on the \nITO is only able to exhibit maximum spontaneous polarization, due to the perpendicular \nalignment of the axis of maximum polarisation in certain areas of grains at discrete \nregions across the surface. Some regions of the surface contain material that is aligned \nwith the axis of maximum polarisation parallel to the surface and, as such, application of \nan electric field to these regions will not induce the maximum polarization for the \nsample. The result of this is that it is not possible to produce an image that is all black or \nafter the application of the poling voltage. This variation of the polarisable dipole means \nthat the material in this region is unsuitable for use as a ferroelectric memory cell. As \nPFM measures the displacement of the surface due to the converse piezoelectric effect, \nthe variation in polarisation is due to the variation in effective d33 of the sample in the \nregions under the probe tip. \n \nThe scale of the regions that show a variation in the domain structure varies across the \nimage. In region A, see Figure 3 a PFM image of the surface of the PZT, the domain \nstructure of the PZT changes over a period of about 500nm, whereas, in region B the \ndomain structure is varying over a period of 8nm. The PZT image shown is a raw data \nDigital Instruments screen capture of the SPM signal input into the AFM, no post capture \ndata manipulation has been performed. Variations in the native polarisation direction of \nthe ferroelectric at these dimensions are likely to have a marked effect on the \nperformance of a FeRAM device made from PZT grown on ITO. Some memory cells \ncould exhibit excellent retention performance due to the high polarisability with other \n6cells behaving less well or not at all. These variations in polarisability lie in the \ntransformation process for perovskite development, which is directly attributed to the \nelectrode system used. PZT grown on Pt electrodes can be produced as very highly \norientated [111] but this system is not suitable for FeRAM devices[14]. \n \nIt is also worth noting that the domain structure produces a herringbone like pattern along \none site of the two crystallite interfaces. These structures are about 8nm in cross section, \nshown in Figure 4 a higher magnification image of region B shown in Figure 3. The \npresence of such fine domains with the associated increase in density of the domain walls \nis likely to have implications on the rate of fatigue for these regions. Although it is \naccepted that an increase in defect density, especially oxygen defects, is mainly \nresponsible for fatigue in PZT ceramics the presence of domains walls also adds to the \nfatigue in the ferroelectric. This is due to the stress relaxation as orthogonal domains \nrelax back to 180\u00ba and the resulting mechanical stresses on the film and domain wall \npinning. The increase in the mechanical stress within the material reduces the polarisation \nof the material. Significant increases in the number of domain walls within the sample \nincrease the local stress and therefore reduce the number of cycles required for fatigue.  \n \nThe magnified section of the PFM image of Figure 4 shows that, along with the \nherringbone pattern present in the PZT, the surface is made up of number of discrete pits. \nThe origin of these pits are believed to stem from noise in the system and can also been \nseen in Figure 3 as a speckling of the image. The speckling seen in the image can also \nbeen seen on the real time output from the lock-in amplifier and is believed to be due to \n7come from the vibration induced by air flow over the sample during analysis. The pits are \nnot visible in the topographic image due to larger amplitude of z-signal when obtaining a \ntopographic image (the topographic height variation is shown on a 50nm scale, vertical \ndisplacement of the piezoresponse signal is at best 50pm[34]). These herringbone \nfeatures are therefore associated with the piezoelectric structure of the sample. A cross \nsectional TEM image of the sample shows features of a similar dimension to the \nherringbone pattern shown in the PFM image, and is shown in Figure 5. It is likely then \nthe nanometre sized crystallites within the large plates of the PZT are responsible for the \nvariation in the piezoelectric response found by PFM. The TEM image also shows that \nthe origin of the plates formed in the PZT stems from the transformation mechanism of \npyrochlore to perovskite PZT [24]. The mechanism of transformation from pyrochlore to \nperovskite PZT that was grown on ITO\/Glass produces a material that has considerable \nvariation in the piezoelectric structure. \n \nWe have shown that a PZT film deposited by spin coating and subsequent firing onto a \nsubstrate highly suitable for FeRAM applications has a variation in domain orientation. \nThe scale of variation in the domain orientation and changes in polarisability across the \nsample has implications for using the material as the storage layer in FeRAM devices. \nCurrent device design relies on homogeneity of materials properties throughout the active \nareas, this was not found for the PZT evaluated.  The ability to image the domains of a \nmaterial and show that they exist with nanometric resolution allows the further \ndevelopment of processes and materials suitable to produce materials for FeRAM \ndevices. \n8 \nFinancial support from TDK Japan, the EPSRC and the Inamouri Foundation is gratefully \nacknowledged. \n \n \n9 \n \nList of figures: \n \nFigure 1, Schematic of apparatus used to complete PFM measurements showing \nmodifications made to Dimension 3000 SPM system. \n \nFigure 2, Tapping mode topographic image for PZT 30\/70 grown on ITO\/Glass. \nIndividual crystallites are visible as the boundaries between them. \n \nFigure 3, PFM domain map for region shown in Figure 2. The interfaces between \ncrystallites are easily seen as is the variation in domain structure shown by the \nvariation in contrast across the image. Region A indicated on the image shows a \nregion of large scale (500nm) variation in domain structure. Region B seen on \nthe image shows a region of small scale variation (8nm) in domain structure. \n \nFigure 4, High resolution PFM scan of Region B indicated in Figure 3.
