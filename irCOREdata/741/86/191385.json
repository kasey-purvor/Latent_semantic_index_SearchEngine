The article\nlooks at the movement behind reform and at why, despite evidence of increased hardship\nfor some, five years on from passage the conventional wisdom is that PRWORA has been a\nsuccess.\nIntroduction\nIn August 1996 the USA embarked on a radical welfare to work experiment aimed\nat working-aged adults receiving means-tested income benefits.1 This generated\nmuch interest in the UK and informed analysts have drawn attention to the\nmanner in which British policy appears to have been influenced by developments\nin America (King and Wickham-Jones, 1999; Deacon, 2000). Both countries have\nseen an emphasis on moving welfare recipients into work, and a willingness to\nimplement coercive measures in order to enforce this movement. There were\nalso parallel political motives at work in the two countries as New Democrat and\nNew Labour leaders chose welfare reform as an area where they could establish\ntheir \u2018New\u2019 credentials by asserting a more dynamic relationship between the\nstate and the welfare recipient. That is, whereas old Democrats and old Labour\nwere perceived as soft on welfare, the \u2018New\u2019 variety were to be tough in their\ndealings with indolent claimants. Indeed the repudiation of the idea that there\nare unqualified claims which able-bodied, working-aged, adults can make against\n19\n20 alex waddan\nthe state has been quite categorical, embodied in the language which declares\n\u2018no rights without responsibilities\u2019, effectively disavowing any notion of welfare\nentitlement or \u2018social rights\u2019.2\nDespite the similarities, however, it is important to understand what is\nhappening in the USA on its own terms. While welfare is an important social\nand political issue in the UK it does not have the heightened symbolic\nsignificance that is apparent in the USA. That is, while popular understanding\nof the complexities of the American welfare system might be limited, welfare\nas an issue encapsulates a clash of values about the importance of work in\nAmerican life; and what was particularly at issue in the mid-1990s was the\nposition of long-term welfare dependants and the sense that they had neglected\ntheir duties and had thus forfeited full citizenship status. According to Judith\nShklar, while the collection of American attitudes towards welfare \u2018is not\nperhaps a coherent ideology . . . it is certainly an intelligible one. Not to work is\nnot to earn, and without one\u2019s earnings one is \u201cnobody\u2019\u2019 \u2019 (1991: 92). Weaver et al.\nsummarised their study of opinion polls asking about attitudes towards welfare\nthus:\nWelfare has come to connote dependence . . . and . . . is perceived to have greater negative than\npositive effects . . . majorities of the public are concerned that welfare benefits may be too high\nand that welfare encourages long-term dependence, and that too many welfare recipients do\nnot want to work . . . \u2018Welfare\u2019, in short, is perceived as being at odds with the widely shared\nAmerican values of individualism and the work ethic. (1995: 607)\nOne poll in October 1994 showed that 89 per cent of respondents favoured\na two-year welfare limit followed by work and 76 per cent agreed that having\nanother child while on welfare should not result in extra benefit. Reflecting on\nthese results, Urban Institute analyst Isabel Sawhill offered the following\nexplanation for why policymakers were increasingly advocating experimental\nprogrammes which were not based on rigorous social science research:\n[I]t is because research gives insufficient emphasis to the role of public morality . . . It ignores\nthe public\u2019s desire to align welfare rules with their own values. The public is not lacking in\ncompassion, but it does believe that poor people should play by the same rules as the middle\nclass. When you don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t get paid. And when you have another baby, you don\u2019t\nget a raise. (1995: 8)\nIn short, by the 1990s many Americans, including many policymakers, had\nconcluded that too many welfare recipients were not making a serious work\neffort. Thus Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign promise \u2018to end welfare as we know it\u2019. As it\nwas, the changes enacted in 1996were more dramatic than Clinton had envisaged;\nbut the fact that he signed the Republican Congress\u2019s reform bill illustrates how\nwelfare was perceived to be a potential wedge issue which could cost him serious\nvotes in the upcoming presidential election.\nredesigning the welfare contract in theory and practice 21\nThe reform\nWithout doubt the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconcili-\nation Act was a landmark in American social policy. It was, in the words of the\nGreen Book, the bible of US social policy data, \u2018the first time that major welfare\nentitlement benefits have been repealed or substantially altered\u2019 (US, 1996: 1328).\nThe PRWORA had a number of objectives, but its primary purpose was to end the\nAid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) programme which had been\npart of the 1935 Social Security Act. In 1994, when AFDC rolls were at their peak, it\nprovided benefits to a monthly average of just over 5million families, adding up to\njust over 14.2 million recipients \u2013 constituting 14.8 per cent of American families\nwith children under eighteen. The total cost was $23.4 billion of which the federal\ngovernment paid just over half and the state governments the remainder. The\naverage monthly benefit per family was $386 (US, 1996: 386), although this figure\nhides large discrepancies between states which set their own level of benefit.\nCritical to understanding the gravity of the changes enacted is that AFDC\nwas a programme which directed income support to poor, largely single parent,\nhouseholds with children under eighteen.3 Thus the new law explicitly targeted\nlow-income female headed families with the purpose of shifting them off welfare,\npreferably by getting the mothers into work or into a stable relationship with\nanother wage earner. The underlying theme was that AFDC had constituted\na \u2018something for nothing\u2019 programme which had undermined traditional\nAmerican principles about the value of work and which, in doing so, had\nsimultaneously created resentment among the majority, non-welfare, population\nand demeaned those on welfare by entrapping them in a cycle of dependency.\nFor social conservatives this self-defeating behaviour was highlighted by the rise\nin out-of-wedlock births, and for some the goal of PRWORA was as much to\nresurrect the primacy of marriage and the two-parent family as it was to require\nwork (Deacon, 2001: 4\u20139).\nOne of the key features of PRWORA was the devolution of responsibility\nfor drawing up particular welfare to work programmes down to the states.4 The\nmoney which the federal government had previously spent on AFDC was given\nto the states with no specific directives about how rolls should be reduced or work\nencouraged. On the other hand, this devolution came with considerable strings\nattached for the states in terms of how future federal money was tied to reaching\nwork participation requirements and\/or caseload reduction targets. More\nfundamentally, the law set absolute time limits for how long welfare recipients\ncould be paid benefits with federal money.5\nIn brief, the PRWORA replaced AFDC with a benefit named Temporary\nAssistance to Needy Families. The law stipulated that welfare recipients could\nreceive TANF cash benefits for a maximum of two years before being required\nto engage in some sort of work-related activity, a time frame which can be\nshortened at state discretion. The law does allow that claimants can be engaged\n22 alex waddan\nin government sponsored activities such as education, training or subsidised\nemployment, at state discretion, for a further three years but this marks the end\nof their assistance, and this five-year limit is a lifetime limit on the receipt of TANF\nbenefits (and again this five-year limit is a maximum which can be shortened\nat state discretion). Overall, although the Act acknowledges that government\nhas an initial duty to provide aid to those falling on hard times, it states\nthat there does come a time when government no longer has an obligation to\nhelp those deemed not to be making a sufficient effort to help themselves and\neven, theoretically, those making a good faith effort to play by the rules but who\ndo not have the resources to make it on their own. Furthermore, while in receipt\nof benefits claimants will suffer financial sanctions if they do not comply with\nstate rules about work effort. The regulations about and use of sanctions as an\narm of policy vary considerably from state to state but all programmes utilise\nthem in one form or another.\nIn reality, given the composition of the welfare population, these new work\nrequirements meant that single mothers with children under eighteen were now\npresumed to be self-sufficient in the long term. Furthermore, this supposition\napplied to all able-bodied welfare mothers, however complex their domestic\ncircumstances and however limited their educational qualifications or prior work\nexperience. States can, however, exempt 20 per cent of their caseload from the\nfive-year lifetime limit which gives some leeway to cater for those who have\nbecome known as \u2018hard to employ\u2019 recipients (see US: 2001).6\nThe attack on AFDC\nInherent in US social policy is a suspicion of giving income benefits to those of\nworking age and this distrust was apparent even at the establishment of AFDC\n(then ADC) in 1935. ADC was always a secondary programme in relation to the\nmain contributory based social insurance old age and unemployment schemes set\nup for wage earners. ADC, for example, was one of only two benefits (along with\nAid to the Blind) established by the 1935 Act which included a criteria of need.\nFurthermore, the benefit was intended only for single mothers who were deemed\nto be morally worthy \u2013 assumed to be widows and some deserted mothers \u2013\nwhich left claimants subject to investigation with their fate in the hands of local\ncaseworkers: and even if a mother satisfied the criteria of being both worthy\nand poor the benefit level still reflected an ambivalence about substituting cash\nbenefits for work. Thus, although the stated intention was to allow women to\nplay the role of mother rather than worker, the payments were often so low that\nthe women could only survive by supplementing their benefit through working\n(Gordon, 1994: 294\u2013301).\nNevertheless, by the late 1960s AFDC had attained something approaching\nentitlement status for poor single-parent families, especially after a series of\nredesigning the welfare contract in theory and practice 23\nSupreme Court decisions in the 1960s took away much of the discretion exercised\nat local level about eligibility (Teles, 1996: 107\u201317).7 These changes and the growing\nnumber of single-parent families did lead to a significant jump in the number\nof families enrolled on AFDC. In 1960, the average monthly number of families\nreceiving AFDC was 803,000, which jumped to just over 1.9 million by 1970 (US,\n1998: 402). One consequence was that from 1969 \u201cwelfare reform\u2019\u2019 became a\npersistent refrain in American politics.\nThroughout the 1970s various unsuccessful reform efforts contained both\nliberal and conservative strands (Waddan, 1998), but from the early 1980s the\nrhetoric took on a more distinctly conservative trajectory as Reagan railed against\nwelfare dependency and invoked the stereotype image of the \u2018welfare queen\u2019.\nReagan\u2019s rhetorical bombast was matched by the work of Charles Murray and\nGeorge Gilder (Gilder, 1981; Murray, 1984). Their arguments were continued\nthrough the 1990s by Robert Rector of the influential right-wing think tank,\nthe Heritage Foundation (Rector, 1992; 1996). The primary contention of\nthese writers is well versed and not that complex. In short, the expansion of\nwelfare programmes, however well-intentioned, was a social disaster as it simply\nencouraged people to make choices which in the long term deprived them of their\ndignity and their capacity to make a meaningful contribution to society. This in\nturn detached them from society and created a quasi-permanent underclass\ntrapped into a culture of dependency. The necessary response was to end those\nprogrammes which fuelled this deviant behaviour.\nWhile Murray and Rector provided the most dramatic expression of\nanti-welfare sentiment a subtler line of conservative thought also emerged,\nchampioned most articulately by Lawrence Mead. What makes Mead particularly\ninteresting is his willingness to tackle the question of social rights as posed by\nMarshall. While Murray and Rector simply do not accept that able-bodied adults\nhave legitimate claims against the state, Mead does not call for the withdrawal of\ngovernment; indeed his \u2018new paternalism\u2019 proposes measures which are highly\ninterventionist (1997a). His contention, however, is that the social conditions\nwhich provided a powerful de facto rationale for entitlement welfare have changed.\nWhen contemplating the \u2018duty of the individual not to become destitute, if he\ncan help it\u2019, Marshall reflected, \u2018In conditions of full employment and a rising\nstandard of living the temptation to indulge in voluntary penury has lost any\nforce it ever had, and, though difficult cases may still sometimes arise, the\nproblem is not one of real importance\u2019 (1981: 90). According to Mead, while\nthis may have been true in the immediate postwar period, by the late 1960s\nthe declining work effort of the welfare poor demanded a change of policy\nemphasis:\nBefore 1960, poverty levels were much higher than now, but most poor adults were\nemployed, and this tended over time to integrate them. Today, there is less poverty, but\n24 alex waddan\nthe separation of the poor from the economy makes integration more doubtful. Therefore,\nsocial programs must promote work, and even enforce it, assuming the function that the\nworkplace did before. (1997b: 229)\nMead\u2019s examination of the work levels of the non-poor and the welfare poor\nled him to conclude, \u2018High work levels for the general population sustain the\ncitizenship rationale for the social insurance welfare state, but low work levels for\nthe poor put that case in question for welfare and other antipoverty programs\u2019\n(p. 206). That is, the non-working poor must abide by society\u2019s norms to lay\nclaim to the \u2018social rights\u2019 of citizenship. These norms include the willingness to\nwork, even for low wages in undesirable jobs; but, according to Mead, too many\nof the welfare poor had shirked this obligation by not taking jobs which were\navailable and which they could do (1997c: 6\u201331).\nAnother key contributor to this discourse was David Ellwood, whose seminal\nbook, Poor Support, recommended a clear time limit to welfare receipt (1988).\nThe book also discussed how government could provide a whole array of\nsupport services, including acting as an employer of last resort and making\nwork a significantly more attractive financial option for welfare recipients; it was,\nhowever, the concept of time limits coming from someone regarded as a moderate\nDemocrat which made his analysis politically compelling. Furthermore, the\ngeneral tirades against dependency had more credibility after surveys during\nthe 1980s illustrated that a greater proportion of welfare recipients were long-\nterm clients than had previously been understood. The traditional methods of\ndata collection suggested that, while there was a lot of cycling on and off welfare,\nmost welfare spells were relatively short lived. Analysis, however, which did not\nlook at the total number of welfare spells but at the welfare population at a given\npoint in time showed that about half the recipients were in spells which would\nlast eight years and more (Bane and Ellwood, 1994). This gave support to those\nwho insisted that there was a chronic problem of long-term welfare dependence.\nAnother critical change to the terms of the debate was the increase in female\nparticipation in the labour force. The traditional perception of the mother\u2019s role\nas being one of nurturing her young was thus a less persuasive argument for not\ndemanding work of welfare mothers.\nPrior to PRWORA the most recent welfare reform measure enacted at federal\nlevel was the 1988 Family Support Act. This gave a more formal structure\nto existing work requirements, but also instituted some supportive services.\nAdvocates championed it as embracing a potentially productive carrot and stick\napproach. The directives of the Act, however, were to be applied gradually and\nbefore the changes had a chance to make a mark the reform was overtaken by\nevents as the welfare rolls grew rapidly. AFDC numbers had been relatively stable\nthrough the 1980s but between 1988 and 1992 the number of recipients rose from\n10.9 million to 13.6 million (US 1994: 325). Thus welfare was once again in the\nredesigning the welfare contract in theory and practice 25\nnews in 1992. When Governor of Arkansas, Clinton had been heavily involved in\nthe development of the FSA, illustrating his genuine interest in and knowledge of\nwelfare issues. On the other hand, his 1992 campaign rhetoric exploited welfare\nto emphasise his \u2018different kind of Democrat\u2019 outlook. The details of prospective\nreform were not fleshed out, but the dramatic language used created a hostage to\nfortune.\nThe administration did put forward a plan of its own in the summer of 1994\nwhich extended the FSA\u2019s principles of combining compulsion with support.\nWhat was new, though, was the inclusion of an explicit two-year time limit before\na work requirement kicked in. The proposal did also, however, acknowledge a\nrole for government as an employer of last resort, and allowed those who left\nwelfare to move into work to buy back future welfare time.8 The bill made\nno legislative headway, however, and the Republican success in November 1994\nfurther shifted the dynamic of the welfare debate. PRWORA firmly declared that\nno able-bodied, working-aged adult is entitled to cash assistance from the state\neither for herself or her children for more than a minimal period. The political\nquestion was whether Clinton would sign this into law. His key welfare advisers,\nwho had worked on the administration\u2019s own proposal, urged him to veto the\nbill, but to no avail (Ellwood, 1996; Bane, 1997; for the story of the final passage\nof PRWORA see Weaver, 2000: 317\u201355).\nAssessing reform: more than Wisconsin\nOver five years on, the prevailing wisdom is that the reform has been a success\nalthough critics still identify causes for concern. There has been a dramatic\ndecline in welfare caseloads and an increased work effort by former recipients. On\nthe other hand, there is little evidence that those working are significantly better\noff and there are signs of increased hardship for some. Before examining the\nevidence, however, it is important to note the methodological problems inhibiting\nassessment. Primarily, there is just too much going on for the reform process to\nbe regarded as a controlled experiment. For example, the extended period of\neconomic prosperity during the 1990s meant wider job availability which might\nexplain the decline in the welfare rolls without reference to PRWORA, especially\nwhen coupled with enhanced work incentives in the form of the increased\nminimum wage and the expanded Earned Income Tax Credit. Advocates of\nreform, however, insist that previous periods of prosperity had not seen a decline\nin the welfare rolls comparable to that which followed the enactment of PRWORA.\nThere are also problems in the collection and analysis of data. For example,\nhow should work participation be calculated? Should surveys count those who\nhave moved into work but then returned to welfare? And should workforce\nparticipation be calculated on a \u2018point in time\u2019 basis or should it include anyone\nwho has worked at all over a certain duration?\n26 alex waddan\nSuch problems are familiar ones to social science research, but the\ncomplexities are exacerbated when trying to appraise developments across the\nfifty states. Although the PRWORA was very prescriptive in a number of ways\nit also left the states with a variety of options. In a recent paper looking at\nworkfare policy in the USA and its adaptation in the UK, Deacon reflects on\nsome important differences between the two countries (2000). One point he\nmakes is that many British observers have only a limited understanding of the\nnature of American federalism and how this has impacted on welfare reform.\nHe comments that the British social policy analyst\u2019s mental map of the USA has\nNew York and California separated by the vast continent of Wisconsin (p. 7);\nunfortunately, the sharpness of this line almost conceals its significant truth.\nThe Wisconsin story is important because it has combined coercion and\nsupport in a vigorous fashion; the state\u2019s welfare rolls dropped by 84 per cent\nbetween August 1996 and September 1999.9 Wisconsin, however, has no more\nclaim to be properly representative of what is going on nationally than any other\nstate in the union. A significant reason for its pre-eminence was the media savvy\nof its publicity greedy governor, Republican Tommy Thompson, who became\nPresident Bush\u2019s Secretary of Health and Human Services. Other states, however,\nwhich receive less publicity have been equally activist in trying to help welfare\nrecipients prepare for and adjust to work. Oregon, for example, with a caseload\nreduction of 45 per cent, brought its welfare numbers down without Wisconsin\u2019s\nstringent application of punitive measures against lagging recipients. At the other\nend of the scale, some states have done very little in the way of setting up innovative\nprogrammes, but \u2018achieved\u2019 high caseload reduction over this period simply by\nchanging eligibility criteria. Idaho, for instance, adopted a policy whereby families\nreceiving Supplemental Security Income, such as those with disabled children,\nwere not eligible for TANF, a move which accounts for a big chunk of the state\u2019s\n90 per cent reduction in its welfare rolls.\nUnderlying some of the variation in practice is the formula used for the\ninitial distribution of money from Washington to the states. Grants were allocated\naccording to how much was being spent within each state on welfare in 1994. This\nmeant that those states which had always spent more on their welfare population,\ngenerally \u2013 meaning those which had higher benefit levels \u2013 got more money. This\nwas a political settlement reflecting two factors. First, the Republican majority in\nCongress was not prepared to increase the overall welfare bill; and second, given\nthat the overall pie was to remain the same size, if those states with high existing\nwelfare costs were to play ball they would not accept any reduction in their\nfunding from the centre. This meant that there were significant differences in\nhow much money per recipient each state received from the federal government\nin order to make welfare to work programmes work.\nFurthermore, the path taken by each state has different ramifications for\nhow the federal requirements impact on it. Minnesota, for instance, is one of\nredesigning the welfare contract in theory and practice 27\nthe few states to include a commitment to reducing poverty in its welfare reform\nprogramme. To this end it continues to pay meaningful benefits to recipients who\nhave moved into work which boosts the income of those in low wage jobs. The\ndownside is that recipients are still eating into their welfare lifetime limit when\nthey do have an alternative source of income (Nolan, 2000).\nOverall, it is imperative to recognise that the politics and policy histories\nof the states are distinct, which has inevitably resulted in different ways of\nimplementing the PRWORA directives. Ironically, however, since the divergence\nin practice means that it is difficult to identify a particular state to use as a\nrepresentative case study it is perhaps better to rely on aggregate national data\nrather than a skewed state sample.\nReducing dependency: an undebateable success?\nThe most immediate evidence is the enormous percentage drop in the overall\nwelfare rolls. Between August 1996 and September 1999 the number of families\nreceiving welfare had dropped from 4.415 million to 2.453 million, a fall of\n44 per cent (Administration for Children and Families, 2000). At the high point\nof AFDC use, in 1994, 5.5 per cent of the population received AFDC (US, 1998:\n402). In contrast, in June 1999 only 2.5 per cent of the American population were\ngetting TANF. For conservatives in the Rector school these figures in themselves\nrepresent success regardless of what else is happening.\nSubtler champions of reform, however, are less interested in this headline\nfigure and maintain that the most important performance indicator is that which\nshows that an increased number of former welfare recipients are now engaged\nin work. As noted above, there are problems in gauging the exact work effort of\nwelfare recipients, but by any measure an increasing number have been active in\nthe labour market. For example, between 1993 and 1999 there was a 50 per cent\nincrease in the number of never married mothers, historically the least likely\nof all women to do paid work, who had a job (Haskins et al., 2001: 4). For critics\nof the old welfare system such as Mead this is crucial because it is through working\nthat welfare recipients will best lose their \u2018welfare\u2019 status and become integrated\ninto mainstream society.\nA related favourite theme of those celebrating the changes is to expand upon\nthe new-found self-respect of those who have moved from welfare to work and to\nemphasise how important it is for the children of welfare mothers to see that there\nis an alternative and more dignified route through life than cashing government\ncheques (Rogers, 1999). Indeed these \u2018empowerment\u2019 conservatives maintain that\nwelfare recipients themselves have welcomed the pressure to reorder their lives.\nMost of the stories told to this effect are anecdotal, but one survey based on fifteen\nfocus groups consisting of welfare recipients and the fathers of their children in\nBaltimore, Boston and Chicago, conducted in late 1996 and throughout 1997,\n28 alex waddan\nfound a perhaps surprising openness to some of the apparently harsher elements\nof the new law. While the authors noted that some respondents were \u2018scared and\nangry\u2019, they reported that, \u2018The majority of the participants favored time limits\non welfare receipt. This was true among African Americans, Hispanics and whites\nand among women and men. They viewed the new provisions as providing them\nwith the motivation to find jobs and improve their lives\u2019 (Burton et al., 1998: 5).\nWhat supporters of the reform emphasise is the overall cocktail of measures.\nThey acknowledge that there are some punitive elements, but insist that these are\nnecessary. Thus an effective sanctions policy is organic to the message that work\neffort is a must.10 One way in which this is often framed is that welfare should be\nmade as close as possible to the real, that is non-welfare, world. If people fail to\nturn up to work for no good reason then they do not get paid. Similarly, therefore,\nif a welfare recipient skips a designated work-related activity then they will lose\nsome benefit. In addition the five-year lifetime limit is defended on the basis that\nit concentrates the mind of both recipient and the caseworker. A further feature\nwhich has emerged in many states is the policy of so-called \u2018diversion\u2019. Essentially\nthis is an effort to prevent people from signing on in the first place. Applicants\nare advised that they will be expected to look for work and so if they can find it,\nor at least some other form of income, they are better off doing this rather than\neating into their welfare time. It is impossible to be accurate but it is clear that this\ndiversion policy has played a significant role in reducing the welfare numbers.\nPeople have always left welfare for many reasons, but they would in turn always\nhave been replaced. The current trend is that fewer and fewer leavers are replaced.\nAgain, advocates of reform point to this as evidence that many potential welfare\nrecipients will make the effort to look after themselves once it is made clear that\nlong-term benefit receipt is not an option.11\nMead, and others who see increased work effort not caseload reduction as\nthe real goal of reform, point out that the punitive measures tell only part of the\nstory. Many states are making a constructive effort to help recipients overcome\nbarriers to work and part of the 1996 package was an increase in federal funds\ngiven to states which had to be devoted to child care. An integral element has\nbeen an effort to change the mindset of the welfare bureaucracies; and, according\nto Nathan and Gais, PRWORA\u2019s stark message did penetrate state welfare offices,\nprompting caseworkers to take a more interventionist role rather than acting\nsimply as clerks checking eligibility (1999).\nReducing poverty: a more ambiguous view\nThere are, however, those who present a more ominous picture of the\nconsequences of reform, concentrating less on dependency and more on poverty.\nAFDC benefits had never been generous enough to lift families above the official\npoverty line, and in some states they were desperately miserly, but they had at\nredesigning the welfare contract in theory and practice 29\nleast constituted a source of income for a vulnerable section of the population.\nCritics of reform focus on the fact that even in a time of economic prosperity\nthe actual financial position of most poor single-parent families did not signi-\nficantly improve in the late 1990s and that for a minority things appeared to get\nworse.\nData suggests that a substantial majority of those welfare recipients who\ndo move into work earn below poverty line wages. A Children\u2019s Defense Fund\nanalysis found that among people who received any welfare in 1997, and who had\nearnings in March 1998, \u2018only 28.8 per cent earned usual weekly wages above the\nequivalent of the three-person poverty line (about $250 a week in 1998 dollars)\u2019.\nMoreover, \u201851 per cent of recent recipients who had earnings in March 1998 had\nweekly wages below three-quarters of the poverty line\u2019 (Sherman et al., 1998: 9).\nA Center on Budget and Policy Priorities survey confirmed that \u2018Studies that\nmeasure parents\u2019 earnings over three-month periods find earnings levels well\nbelow the poverty line\u2019 (Parrott, 1998: 10). Many of these families will be eligible\nfor the Earned Income Tax Credit and Food Stamps and, depending on their\nstate\u2019s policy, may continue to receive some TANF benefits. Nevertheless, even if\nall of these are factored in (and the extra costs involved in working are ruled out),\nmoving into work will likely make former recipients better off only marginally,\nwith the strong likelihood that family income will remain below the poverty line\n(Jencks and Swingle, 2000: 38).\nFurthermore, it is unclear just how much qualitative improvement there has\nbeen in the lives of those recipients who have moved into work. Many struggle\nto juggle complex home lives with the demands of the workplace (Heymann,\n2000), especially as most welfare recipients are low skilled and \u2018the jobs available\nto low-skilled women tend to pay low wages, experience high turnover, and offer\nfew fringe benefits or opportunities for advancement to higher wage positions\u2019\n(Bloom, 1997: 17). For example, one pre-PRWORA welfare-to-work experiment\nin California, deemed a success illustrating the viability of reform, found that of\nthose welfare recipients who moved into work only 28.8 per cent found jobs with\npaid sick days, only 34.1 per cent with paid vacation days and only 27.5 per cent\nhad health benefits attached (Riccio et al., 1994: 170).12 Overall, while it may well\nbe true that earning one\u2019s income can be a source of self-respect for many on\nwelfare this is only a solution to one of life\u2019s many problems (DeParle, 1999).\nThere is also concern about those no longer on welfare but not working.\nThis constitutes a significant group of people whose fate is unclear (Sherman\net al., 1998: 8). Some will have moved in with relatives or boyfriends, but others\nseem to have just disappeared. Where there is data available there is evidence of\nan increase in levels of extreme poverty, partially, at least, caused by a reduction\nin welfare payments. A CBPP report found that the worst off 20 per cent of\nsingle-parent families suffered a 7 per cent decline in disposable income between\n1995 and 1997, leaving them with an average of $8,047. According to the authors,\n30 alex waddan\n\u2018Almost 80per cent of the decline . . . resulted from losses of means-tested benefits\u2019\n(Primus et al., 1999: 10). The same report also notes that in 1995, 3.2 million\nchildren were removed from poverty by means-tested benefits, but that in 1997\nthis had dropped 2.4 million (p. 23).13 One problem is that welfare caseload\ndecline has outstripped the decline in poverty. That is, in 1993, 57 per cent of\npoor children were in families receiving AFDC but in 1998 only 47 per cent were\nin families receiving TANF; and, while child poverty dropped by 5.3 per cent\nbetween 1995 and 1997 the child welfare caseload decline was 16.5 per cent over\nthe same period (Primus, 1999).\nCritics also worry that some of the features encouraged by reform advocates\nare at best double-edged swords. For example, supporters claim that diversion\nshows that people will make more of an effort from the start if they are encouraged\nto do so. In reality, though, very little is known about who the \u2018diverted\u2019 are and\nwhat subsequently happens to them once their initial application for TANF is\ndelayed. There is certainly evidence that a significant number do not realise that\nthey are still eligible for other benefits such as Food Stamps and Medicaid even\nif they cannot immediately claim TANF (Meyers, 2000). One implication is that\ndiversion roots out those who were claiming welfare while getting income from\nundeclared work; yet, while there is evidence that many welfare mothers did\ntechnically defraud the state this was often the only way that they could make\nends meet (Edin and Lein, 1997). Another worry surrounds the use of sanctions.\nData on families likely to be sanctioned is limited, but some early indicators\nsuggest that those adults penalised \u2018were more likely to have dropped out of high\nschool . . . or to have reported . . . transportation, child care, or health difficulties\u2019\nthan other TANF family heads (US, 2000: 5).\nThe jury is still out\nThere are a number of areas where the jury is still out and more evidence\nis needed before any sensible judgements can be reached. It is too early, for\nexample, to say whether the reform will make a difference to family structures\n(Deacon, 2001: 7); and even if evidence emerges that more potentially poor single\nmothers are living with partners it would still need to be ascertained that this\nwas a plus for their general welfare. One lurking question is what the long-term\naffects of economic downturn and in particular a rise in unemployment will be\n(Pavetti, 1998). Implicit in the setting of time limits is the assumption that there\nare sufficient jobs available for welfare recipients to move successfully into the\nlabour market. This remains disputed (Mead, 1992; Wilson, 1996; Lerman et al.,\n1999), but the sustained period of economic growth in the late 1990s did mean\nthat the initial circumstances were as favourable as possible for implementing\na work enforcement regime. Whether the jobs will disappear in the event of\na long downturn cannot be simply predicted. Low-wage work does tend to be\nredesigning the welfare contract in theory and practice 31\nparticularly sensitive to economic fluctuations, but the existing models studying\nthe affects of recession on welfare rolls were developed in the pre-PRWORA\ncontext and do not take into account the unprecedented number of welfare\nleavers since the mid-1990s.\nA related question is whether the \u2018Work First\u2019 philosophy which most states\nhave written into their programmes, which basically says that any job is preferable\nto education and training, will be to the long-term advantage of those making\nthe welfare to work transition. The rationale is that work discipline is the priority\n(combined with the feeling that many welfare clients have negative attitudes\ntowards education). The potential downside is that people will remain stuck in\nlow-wage jobs because they have not developed the skills to progress.\nIt is also uncertain how the five-year maximum will be applied. Will states\nblink and find ways of continuing to subsidise poor families? Indeed it is far from\nclear that states have the bureaucratic capacity to track quite how long people\nhave been on welfare. A possible scenario is the rather random application of\nPRWORA\u2019s regulations with the potential danger that if fewer people are left\nstranded than the law\u2019s critics have predicted then those that are cut off will be\nlittle noticed.\nConclusion: bringing values back in\nClearly then, there is already much contrasting evidence as to the success of\nthe reform with much yet to be revealed. Indeed some conservatives have\nacknowledged that if the real goal of reform \u2018is less dysfunctional behaviour\namong parents and better outcomes for children\u2019 then \u2018We may need a generation\nto find out\u2019 what the impact of PRWORA has been (Besharov and Germanis, 2001:\n79). Most commentators, however, do not have such patience and as things stand,\nthose who advocated the reform are championing the preliminary results and\nopponents, while still expressing their concerns, are somewhat on the back foot.\nWhen sifting through the evidence, however, it is important not to miss the\nwood for the trees. That is, it is necessary to step away a little from the effort to\ncrunch the raw data and take the debate back into the realm of ideology and more\nspecifically to citizenship. Clearly policy should be based on good practice, but\nthe analysis of what exactly constitutes good practice is in many cases unresolved.\nSometimes this is because of genuinely different methodological approaches and\nthe difficulty of obtaining reliable data sets. More fundamentally, however, it\nalso reflects the fact that the analysts, for all their statements of objectivity, are\ntrying to prove different things \u2013 or at least highlight different perspectives,\nwhich in turn reflects their different value judgements. It is pretty easy to agree\nthat people should be encouraged into the workforce, and that if barriers to\nemployment can be identified, government should help to overcome them; but\nshould government compel work in return for benefits and say that ultimately\n32 alex waddan\nit is not responsible for the economic fate of its citizens? PRWORA suggests\nthat the American government has come to the conclusion that it should and\nfundamentally this judgement is not based on accumulated research evidence\nbut is a statement of political and social values. Work is, in effect, a prerequisite\nof citizenship, at least for the welfare poor.\nNotes\n1 The author would like to thank the Nuffield Foundation for its generous support in helping\nfund the research for this article.\n2 Some see that as a move back to \u2018Poor Law\u2019 style ideology (Handler and Hasenfeld, 1997;\nHeron and Dwyer, 1999).\n3 In 1996, 4,553,000 families received AFDC. Of these, 302,000 were covered by the\nAFDC\u2013UP programme where needy two-parent families could claim benefit if the principal\nwage earner was unemployed but had a recent work history (US, 1998: 402).\n4 Many states were already experimenting under so-called \u2018waivers\u2019 schemes (Friedlander and\nBurtless, 1995; Norris and Thompson, 1995). In the mid-1990s there was a wider movement\nto devolve key elements of domestic policy down to the states although, AFDC apart, this\neffort largely failed (see Weaver, 1996).\n5 TANF recipients will also likely be eligible for Food Stamps and various child nutrition\nprogrammes as well as Medicaid.\n6 This percentage was not based on social science research but was a compromise political\nnumber. States can also provide aid to recipients beyond five years at their own expense.\n7 In theory, AFDC was not an unqualified entitlement as the Work Incentive Program\namendments of 1971 and the Family Support Act of 1988 had attached work requirements\nto the benefit. These, however, had only been applied to a minority of recipients (see\nBerkowitz, 1991: 133\u20136 on WIN; and King, 1991, on the FSA). As it was, in the early 1960s\nabout 33 per cent of families applying for welfare were successful. By 1971 around 90 per\ncent were (Katz, 1989: 106).\n8 David Ellwood, working in the Department of Health and Human Services, was a key\nfigure in drawing up the Clinton bill. He described himself as very satisfied with its content.\nInterview with author, April 1999.\n9 The data for Wisconsin and for all states mentioned in this section are from Administration\nfor Children and Families (2000).\n10 Rector and Youssef argue that caseload decline is related to each state\u2019s application of\nsanctions. The tougher the sanction regime then the sharper the decline. In contrast, they\nargue, there is no direct correlation between state unemployment rates and caseload change\n(1999).\n11 For a discussion of diversion techniques, see Maloy et al. (1998).\n12 This needs to be understood in an American context where many workers, who have never\nbeen on welfare, are employed on these conditions (Levitan et al., 1993; Schwarz, 1997), and\nthe effort to push welfare clients into work is not intended to put them in a position where\nthey are better off than the already working poor or near-poor.\n13 \u2018Means-tested\u2019 here refers to AFDC\/TANF, Food Stamps, Supplemental Security Income,\nschool lunches and housing assistance.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank the Nuffield Foundation for the financial support which made\nit possible to conduct the research for this article.\nredesigning the welfare contract in theory and practice 33\nReferences\nAdministration for Children and Families (2000), \u2018Change in TANF Caseloads Since the En-\nactment of New Welfare Law\u2019, US Department of Health and Human Services, 6 June.\nBane, M.
