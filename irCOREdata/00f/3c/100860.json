The pre-\nferred wavelength for such systems is 1.5 \u0001m. Optical gain\nin Si has been shown recently utilizing the Raman effect2\u20134\nand phase matched four wave mixing,5 although neither is\ncapable of being electrically pumped. One report shows op-\ntically pumped lasing in crystalline Si,6 at 1.27 \u0001m, attrib-\nuted to the so called A center introduced using surface tex-\nturing. It is unclear whether this center, whose nature and\norigin is unknown, can be incorporated using CMOS pro-\ncesses or electrically pumped. The gain curve of this center\nis too narrow, \u00051 nm, for optical amplifiers, where a broad\ngain spectrum is needed.5 Here we show gain over 150 nm,\ncentered at 1550 nm, ideally suited for dense wavelength\ndivision multiplexing.\nOptical gain in semiconductors is almost universally\nachieved by population inversion of carriers in a p-n junc-\ntion. This requires high gain as the high doping required\nleads to high free carrier and Auger losses, and is only\nachievable in direct gap semiconductors. An alternative is to\nincorporate a dopant that can be electrically pumped and has\ninternal gain. Although these are often low gain they can be\nincorporated in to low-loss devices, in principle, enabling net\ngain.\nThe rare earth erbium \u0001Er3+\u0002 has intrinsic gain and is\nexcited electrically in Si via band gap recombination.7 Al-\nthough Er has often been mooted as a route to gain in Si,\nthe optical cross sections were supposed too small\n\u0001\u000510\u221220 cm2\u0002 to achieve sufficient gain,7 as this would\nrequire the incorporation of unrealistic Er concentrations\n\u0001\u00051020 cm\u22123\u0002. However, if these constraints could be over-\ncome, it would enable the development of fully integrated Si\noptical amplifiers and lasers.\nWe report experimental measurements of optical gain\ndue to Er in Si. The low gain of the rare earths and the\nrestricted device dimensions of only a few centimeters in\nsemiconductors have previously prevented the measurement\nof the gain coefficients. Here we have developed a technique\nto enable the measurement of low gain systems in short\nsemiconductor waveguides.\nExperiments were carried out on samples fabricated in\nsilicon-on-insulator \u0001SOI\u0002 material. The high refractive index\nSi overlayer forms a waveguide between the oxide interface\nand the surface. The sample and the measurement system are\nshown in Fig. 1. The sample is mounted inside a cryostat.\nPhotoluminescence \u0001PL\u0002 is excited within the waveguide at\none end of the sample, by the probe laser, set at 488 nm and\nmodulated at a high frequency. The light passes through a\nregion of the waveguide illuminated by the pump laser and is\ncollected from the far end of the sample. The pump laser, set\nat 514 nm, is modulated at a much lower frequency and fo-\ncused to a stripe 250 \u0001m wide and 1 cm long. The output\nand changes in the output are measured using the technique\nwhere two lock-in amplifiers are connected in series. The\noutput intensity is measured as a function of wavelength by\nthe first lock-in amplifier, referenced to the probe frequency.\nThe output of this first lock-in is fed into the second lock-in\namplifier. The change, increase or decrease, in the transmit-\nted light is then measured by the second lock-in referenced\nto the lower modulation frequency. The change in the loss\/\ngain coefficients due to the optical pumping can be calcu-\nlated directly from the fractional change in the transmitted\na\u0002Also at: Si-Light Technologies Ltd.

Photoluminescence is excited by\na probe laser at one end of the sample, modulated at 96 Hz. The PL output,\nas a function of wavelength, is measured at lock-in 1 referenced to this\nfrequency.

The main features of this technique are, firstly, the use\nof internally generated PL from the sample itself as the\nprobe. This avoids the highly problematic, if not impossible,\ntask of efficiently coupling an external broad band light\nsource into a narrow waveguide at low temperatures down a\ncryostat. More fundamentally, in short lengths of materials\nwith low gain coefficients the effect of the pump is inevitably\nsmall \u0001in this case \u00050.1% \u20131%\u0002 and well within the noise\nlevel of the probe; consequently, the use of a single lock-in to\nmeasure either the effect of the pump on a dc probe or vice\nversa is insufficient. This limitation is overcome with the\nsuitable, serial connection of two lock-ins described here.\nTypical luminescence spectra, measured at 100 K and\nwith a pump beam power density of 4 W cm\u22122, are shown in\nFig. 2\u0001a\u0002. Curve 1 \u0001\u2022\u0002 is the PL from the end of the sample\ndue to the probe laser only, measured on lock-in 1. Curve 2\n\u0001\u0001\u0002, coincident with the x axis, is the output from lock-in 2\nwith only the pump laser on. Clearly no PL due to the pump\nlaser is detected showing that lock-in 1 is acting as a perfect\nblocking filter. Finally, curve 3 \u0001\u0002\u0002 shows the change in the\ntransmitted light from the probe due to the pump laser. Curve\n1 is typical of the samples. The peaks at 1130 and 1190 nm\nare the phonon assisted band-to-band emission from Si and\nthe associated phonon replica.1 The emission between 1200\nand 1500 we believe is associated with residual implant dam-\nage. The 1500\u20131650 region is associated with the Er transi-\ntions. The spectral shape for Er3+ over this range is typical of\nthat observed previously in Si at this temperature8 and in\nparticular shows clearly resolved peaks at 1550 and 1595 nm\nassociated with the two main 4I13\/2-\n4I15\/2 transitions in the 4f\nshell. It can be seen from the change in PL \u0001curve 3\u0002 that the\ntransmitted light has suffered loss at the Si and defect peaks,\nattributed to the additional absorption due to free carriers\ngenerated by the pump laser9 but shows net material gain\nwhere expected in the Er region. Crucially, this result shows\nthat the gain significantly exceeds any losses due to the ad-\nditional free carriers needed to achieve it. Figure 2\u0001b\u0002 shows\nthe fractional change in transmission converted to change \u0003g\nin the net material gain where \u0003g=g\u2019\u2212\u0004 ,g\u2019 is the gain due to\nthe stimulated emission and \u0004 is the optical loss. The losses\nin regions 1000\u20131500 nm are clear as is the gain over the Er\nregion from 1550 to 1650 nm. For this particular experimen-\ntal run and sample, \u0003g=0.013 cm\u22121 for the peak gain and the\nsignal to noise ratio is around 15:1, which could be further\nimproved by increasing the averaging time constant on the\nsecond lock in. Consequently, we estimate that this technique\ncould detect gain values down to around 0.001 cm\u22121.\nWe have measured four SOI samples with different Si\noverlayer thicknesses and background doping to allow a\ngreater range of effective concentrations to be accessed.\nSamples S1, a 2.1-\u0001m-thick Si heavily doped \u00012\n\u00021017 cm\u22123\u0002 n-type layer, and S2, a 2.5 \u0001m moderately\ndoped \u00013\u00021016 cm\u22123\u0002 p-type layer, were implanted with Er\nat five different energies \u00011.5, 1.0, 0.65, 0.4, and 0.25 MeV\u0002\nand doses \u00011.6\u00021013, 1.0\u00021013, 7.5\u00021012, 5.0\u00021012, and\n3.3\u00021012 cm\u22122, respectively\u0002 to provide an essentially uni-\nform doping of 1018 cm\u22123 to a depth of about 0.5 \u0001m. The\ntotal implanted dose was 4.18\u00021013 cm\u22122, giving an effec-\ntive concentration, the dose averaged over the waveguide\nvolume of 2.0\u00021017 cm\u22123 for sample S1 and of 1.7\n\u00021017 cm\u22123 for sample S2. These samples were subse-\nquently annealed at 850 \u00b0C for 1 min in nitrogen ambient.\nSamples S3 and S4 were phosphorus doped n-type Si layers\nwith doping concentrations of 1014 cm\u22123 and 1.5 and 5 \u0001m\nin thickness, respectively. These were identically implanted\nwith 2\u00021013 Er cm\u22122 at 0.4 MeV and subsequently annealed\nat 950 \u00b0C for 1 min. This corresponds to a peak concentra-\ntion of 3\u00021018 cm\u22123 and an effective concentration of 1.3\n\u00021017 cm\u22123 for sample S3 and 4\u00021016 cm\u22123 for sample S4.\nPrior to the Er implant, samples S3 and S4 were also im-\nplanted with 1015 B cm\u22122 at 30 keV and annealed at 950\u00b0 C\nfor 20 min in nitrogen ambient to form light emitting diode\nstructures. This process has been previously used to improve\nand in some situations reverse the temperature quenching of\nthe Si and Er luminescence in crystalline Si and provide\nroom temperature operating light emitting diodes.1,8\nFigure 3\u0001a\u0002 shows \u0003g, taken at 1550 nm and normalized\nto 100 K, as a function of temperature for all the samples.\nThe thermal quenching is significantly reduced in the boron\ncodoped samples and we believe could be completely elimi-\nnated in optimized device structures as has been demon-\nFIG. 2. \u0001a\u0002 Curve 1 \u0001\u0001\u0002 shows the PL due to the probe laser only, taken\nfrom the output of lock-in 1.

Curve 2 \u0001\u0001\u0002, coincident with the origin, is the output from\nlock-in 2 with the pump laser on and probe laser off.

This carrier loss has been previously shown to be\nreduced by the use of boron doping to produce dislocation\nloops that when properly engineered can introduce a diffu-\nsion barrier decoupling carriers from the nonradiative\ndefects.1\nThe inset of Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002 shows \u0003g spectra for sample S2 at\ndifferent temperatures. The higher resolution used over the\ngain region has enabled the expected structure of the two\nmain emission lines of the Er gain curve to be resolved.\nFigure 3\u0001b\u0002 shows the power dependence of \u0003g. The solid\nlines are theoretical fits using the standard rate equation\nmodel for the Er3+ ion,10 using only two fitting parameters.\nTerms for cooperative up-conversion and excited state ab-\nsorption were not included, indicating that these loss mecha-\nnisms are negligible in the Er-doped Si system.10,11 Values of\nthe maximum change in net gain, \u0003gmax, for the differently\ndoped samples are obtained by extrapolation of the fits\nof \u0003g to the saturation region and are 0.032\u00b10.001,\n0.0128\u00b10.0003, 0.0673\u00b10.002, and 0.0267\u00b10.0007 cm\u22121\nfor samples S1, S2, S3, and S4, respectively. Figure 3\u0001c\u0002\nshows \u0003gmax as a function of the effective Er concentration.\nFor comparison we have also plotted the maximum gain,\ngmax\u0001 \u0001gmax\u0001 =\u0005N, where \u0005 is the optical emission cross section\nand N is the effective Er concentration\u0002, using the expected\nvalue of 1.8\u000210\u221220 cm2 for the optical emission cross\nsection.7 Measured \u0003gmax values are around six times higher\nin the Er-doped samples and around 30 times higher for the\nEr samples codoped with boron than expected. This gives an\neffective lower limit to the optical cross section for the Er in\nthe boron doped samples of \u00015.0\u00b10.1\u0002\u000210\u221219 cm2. The\nlower \u0003gmax measurements in the Er only samples is attrib-\nuted to the faster temperature quenching than in the samples\ncodoped with boron. The mechanism for the increase in the\nstimulated emission cross section in Si over that seen in\nglassy hosts is currently unclear. However, a comparable en-\nhancement of gain has been previously observed in Er in\nSiO2 when Si nanocrystals \u0001nc-Si\u0002, which mediate the exci-\ntation, have been introduced.10 In this work they obtained a\nvalue for the emission cross section of \u00012.0\u00b10.5\u0002\n\u000210\u221219 cm2 for their Er-doped nc-Si sensitized SiO2\u2014half\nthe value obtained here on Er-doped bulk Si. At an Er con-\ncentration 1019 cm\u22123 we would expect to obtain a gain of\n22 dB cm\u22121.\nIn summary we have demonstrated and measured optical\ngain in Er-doped Si. The values measured far exceed previ-\nous expectations of the likely gain values in this system. The\ngain values obtained mean that the development of optical\namplifiers and laser devices using this approach now be-\ncomes a realistic possibility at achievable, optically active\ndoping levels. This system therefore offers a potential route\nto fully CMOS compatible, all silicon, photonic integrated\ncircuits.\n1W. L. Ng, M. A. Louren\u00e7o, R. M. Gwilliam, S. Ledain, G. Shao, and K.
