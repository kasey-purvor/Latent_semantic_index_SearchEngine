Introduction \nThe variety of forms of political organization created in human history is bewildering, \nbut there has never been a polity that displayed two features at the same time: a \nterritorial extension sufficient to encompass the perceived boundaries of economic, \nsocial and military interdependence on the one hand, and a governance structure that \nwould satisfy contemporary standards of \u2018democracy\u2019 on the other. Hedley Bull \nremarked that \u2018there has never been a government of the world, but there has often been \na government supreme over much of what for those subjected to it was the known \nworld\u2019 (Bull, 1977: 244). \u2018Subjected\u2019 is a key word in this sentence, since none of those \n 2 \n\u2018global\u2019 governments were based on anything resembling modern principles of \ndemocratic citizenship, representation and accountability.  \n Despite the lack of empirical instances, or perhaps because of it, the idea of a \ndemocratic world polity has attracted thinkers and political activists since the eighteenth \ncentury. It is during the Enlightenment that the old idea of a \u2018universal monarchy\u2019, \nwhich had been advocated in medieval Europe by the likes of Dante Alighieri, was \ncombined with radical ideas about republicanism and democracy to produce projects for \nworld governance based on democratic structures and procedures. In the twentieth \ncentury there has been no shortage of plans and blueprints for democratically organized \nleagues of nations, world federations, cosmopolitan democracies, and other \ncombinations of representative and international governance.1 Nor has there been a \nshortage of stern criticisms of such ideas. Some of those criticisms concern the \ndesirability of global democracy, such as the suggestion that any global polity might \neasily degenerate into global tyranny, or that it would simply be a tool in the hand of the \nmost powerful governments, or that it would destroy national democracy and cultural \ndiversity. But even more frequently the idea of global democracy has been dismissed as \na daydream with no prospect of realization in the real world. Bull, for instance, was \nprepared to take seriously the idea of a world government in his wide-ranging mapping \nof conceivable alternatives to the states system, but he dismissed it as an actual \npossibility, as he observed that \u2018There is not the slightest evidence that sovereign states \nin this century will agree to subordinate themselves to a world government founded \nupon consent\u2019 (Bull, 1977: 252). He also chastised \u2018Western radicals\u2019 such as Richard \nFalk for the \u2018fundamental pessimism that underlies the superficial optimisms of their \npronouncements that disaster will immediately befall us unless drastic transformations \nare effected, which they themselves must know to have no prospect of being carried \nout\u2019 (Bull, 1977: 294). \n The end of the Cold War brought about a resurgence of thinking about global \ndemocracy, as well as a new barrage of criticisms. Critics can be found among \nspecialists in international relations (IR) as well as experts of democracy and \ndemocratization. For instance, a prominent representative of contemporary Realist \nthinking in IR, Randall Schweller, wrote a harsh commentary on Andrew Linklater\u2019s \nThe Transformation of Political Community (1998), a book that had grounded \n 3 \nnormative support for transnational democracy in critical theory and discourse ethics \nand had highlighted opportunities for its realization under post-Westphalian conditions. \nSchweller branded those views as \u2018fantasy theory\u2019 and trusted that practitioners of \ninternational politics \u2018understand that foreign policy is too serious a business to \nentertain utopian ideas about dramatically reconstructed social relations; confronted by \nweighty foreign policy decisions, they do not enjoy the luxury of retreating into a \nfantasy world of their own creation but instead must act under real-world constraints, \nknowing that bad judgment can lead to the subjugation or extinction of the state and its \ncitizens.\u2019 (Schweller, 1999: 150). Robert Keohane is a prominent critic of the Realist \nview of the world and in recent years has devoted considerable attention to the range of \naccountability mechanisms that can prevent and control abuses of power in world \npolitics. But he is very careful in distinguishing the sum of those mechanisms from \nglobal democracy, which he considers \u2018infeasible\u2019 (Grant and Keohane, 2005: 40). \n\u2018Unfortunately\u2019, the vision of a system of democratic accountability in world politics \n\u2018would be utopian in the sense of illusory \u2013 impossible of realization under realistically \nforeseeable conditions\u2019 (Keohane, 2006: 77). One of the foremost scholars of \ndemocracy, Robert Dahl, not only pointed to the lacking democratic quality of existing \ninternational organizations, but posed a more fundamental question: \u2018Can international \norganizations, institutions, or processes be democratic? I argue that they cannot be.\u2019 He \nacknowledged that international organizations or even a world government may perform \nuseful functions but, because of a fundamental trade-off between citizen participation \nand scale of government, \u2018the opportunities available to the ordinary citizen to \nparticipate effectively in the decisions of a world government would diminish to the \nvanishing point.\u2019 As international political systems are bound to remain below any \nreasonable threshold of democracy, \u2018we should openly recognize that international \ndecision-making will not be democratic\u2019 (Dahl, 1999: 19, 22, 23; see also Dahl, 2001). \n It is not always clear when sceptics consider global democracy to be impossible \nrather than just very unlikely. Many Realist authors probably would make a claim for \nempirical impossibility, as they believe in the fundamental continuity of international \nrelations throughout human history. A prominent Realist, Robert Gilpin, stated that \n\u2018Realism is based on practices of states, and it seeks to understand how states have \nalways behaved and presumably will always behave.\u2019 Its key insight is said to be that \n 4 \n\u2018the fundamental nature of international relations has not changed over the millennia. \nInternational relations continue to be a recurring struggle for wealth and power among \nindependent actors in a state of anarchy\u2019 (Gilpin, 1981: 226, 7).2 \u2018Liberal\u2019 sceptics may \nbe less inflexible. Keohane\u2019s remark quoted earlier could be read as implying that \nglobal democracy may become possible under different conditions that are \nunforeseeable for the time being. Michael Doyle maintains that \u2018no strong version of \nglobal democracy is viable at the present time\u2019 (Doyle, 2000: 90, emphasis added). \nDebates about the feasibility of global democracy are hampered by ambiguities about \nwhat \u2018possibility\u2019 means, when the term is applied to large-scale political and social \ntransformations.  \n This article develops an operational understanding of possibility, which may \nhelp clarify and perhaps reduce differences of opinion among scholars, and assesses the \npossibility of global democracy in the light of different strands of the political science \nliterature. The steps of the argument are as follows. I first present a working definition \nof global democracy and discuss what it means to say that it may be possible or \nimpossible (section 2). I argue that empirical possibility is best conceived as \ncompatibility with a range of necessary condition hypotheses that are presently \nsupported by empirical studies. Then the article examines two particularly relevant sets \nof necessary conditions. First, the literature on democratization is assessed in order to \nestablish which (if any) conditions can be considered necessary for democratic \ntransitions on the basis of historical and comparative evidence (section 3). As this \nsearch yields one plausible necessary condition \u2013 a degree of political centralization \u2013 I \nthen focus on that condition and assess the international relations literature to determine \nwhether the emergence of a democratic global polity would violate inescapable \nconstraints on international systemic change (section 4). I conclude by offering some \nthoughts on the implications of the argument and directions of further research (section \n5).  \n \n2. Defining \u2018global democracy\u2019 and \u2018possibility\u2019 \nThis section addresses two questions. First, what is \u2018global democracy\u2019? Second, what \ndoes it mean to say that it is \u2018possible\u2019? The following discussion does not aim to \n 5 \nprovide any definitive answer to these complex questions, but only an operational \nconceptualization aimed at setting the stage for the arguments that will follow. \n.  For the purposes of this article, \u2018global democracy\u2019 refers to a range of \nconceivable institutional systems that share a number of characteristics: to qualify, they \nmust (1) encompass all regions of the world; (2) empower supranational bodies to make \nbinding decisions on a range of (enumerated) issues of global relevance; (3) ensure that \nthe members of those bodies are representative of, and accountable to, groups of \ncitizens, through electoral mechanisms or other formal and transparent relationships of \npolitical delegation; (4) promote the equal representation of all world citizens in \nconjunction with other principles such as a balanced representation of the constitutive \nterritorial units and possibly forms of functional representation; (5) allow the \nsupranational bodies to take decisions in accordance with a variety of decision rules, but \nexclude veto rights for small minorities, except when they are based on legitimate and \nimpartially determined vital interests; (6) empower independent supranational judicial \nbodies to resolve conflicts in accordance with constitutional rules; (7) include robust \nmechanisms for promoting compliance with decisions and rulings, possibly but not \nnecessarily through the centralized control of the means of coercion. \n This definition is deliberately vague \u2013 essentially democracy as constitutional, \nrepresentative and inclusive decision-making institutions \u2013 because the arguments \ndeveloped in this article are meant to apply to a wide range of world order proposals3 \nWhile such proposals differ according to several dimensions, many of them can be \nimagined as being somewhere along a continuum from federalist to confederal models \nof political organization.4 Federalist models stress the direct and equal representation of \ncitizens in global bodies, centralization of the means of coercion, and supremacy of \nfederal law over state law. Confederal models stress the gate-keeping role of \ngovernments between citizens and global institutions, dispersion of military and \ncoercive capabilities, and the ability of individual member states to block any undesired \ncollective decision. The argument of this article is particularly relevant for an \nintermediate model that is known as \u2018cosmopolitan democracy\u2019 (Held, 1995; Archibugi, \n2008).5  \n What does it mean to ask if global democracy is possible? Philosophers \ndistinguish between different kinds of possibility, notably logical possibility (i.e., free \n 6 \nfrom logical contradictions), metaphysical possibility (i.e., compatibility with the nature \nand identity conditions of things), nomological possibility (i.e., compatibility with the \nlaws of nature), and deontic possibility (i.e., compatibility with certain norms or rules) \n(Divers, 2002: 3-9; Gendler and Hawthorne, 2002). This article is not concerned with \nthe deontic dimension of global democracy, as this question has been explored in great \ndepth by other authors.6 In the social sciences, examples of statements about logical \npossibility are the impossibility theorems proved by axiomatic social choice theory \n(Arrow, 1951; List and Pettit 2002) and the so-called \u2018impossible trinity\u2019 of fixed \nexchange rate, free capital movement and independent monetary policy that derives \nfrom the assumptions of the Mundell-Fleming model in international economics. \nHowever, this article does not consider the logical possibility of global democracy, \nbecause few people, if any, would maintain that global democracy is a logically \ncontradictory notion. \n In principle, it is possible to make a case against the metaphysical possibility of \nglobal democracy. The argument could be that (a) a global demos would (empirically?) \nrequire a shared global identity and (b) a global identity is metaphysically impossible \nbecause every collective identity needs an external \u2018Other\u2019 and thus can never be global. \nThis line of argument will not be pursued here, because various variants of thesis (b) \nhave been thoroughly analysed and, in my opinion, persuasively refuted by Abizadeh \n(2005). \n The possibility considered in this article is thus empirical. However, defining \nempirical possibility is fraught with difficulties. Possibility theory, which has been \ndeveloped as an alternative to probability theory in the analysis of uncertainty (Zadeh, \n1978), provides a framework for conceptualizing the differences and relationship \nbetween two types of possibility judgement. It distinguishes between what is \u2018not \nimpossible\u2019 because it is not ruled out by our beliefs and what is \u2018guaranteed possible\u2019 \nbecause it has been observed. Uncertainty about what is possible can be reduced or \nmodelled through \u2018knowledge\u2019, \u2018data\u2019, and their merger. Knowledge is conceived as \nnegative information in the sense that it expresses constraints on how the world \nbehaves, such as physical laws or common sense. Data is positive information as it \nconsists of actual observations on the world. The accumulation of negative information \nrestricts the set of possible worlds, whereas the accumulation of positive information \n 7 \nexpands it. Possibility theory offers formal tools for analysing the consistency and \nmerger of the two types of information, and conceptualizes learning processes as \nturning data into knowledge (Benferhat et al., 2008; Dubois and Prade, 2009). \n As I noted in the introduction, global democracy has never been observed, at \nleast as it is understood in this article. While scholars have collected \u2018data\u2019 on several \nprocesses that could in time lead to its emergence,7 an assessment of its possibility must \nrely to a significant extent on background \u2018knowledge\u2019 (in the sense of possibility \ntheory). However, it is not self-evident what should count as relevant knowledge. \nEmpirical impossibility is sometimes understood as incompatibility with what we know \nabout the \u2018laws of nature\u2019, i.e. nomological impossibility (Gendler and Hawthorne, \n2002). This criterion, however, faces serious problems, especially when applied to the \nsocial sciences. For instance, physicists regard the impossibility of travelling faster than \nlight as an objective constraint that operates independently of people\u2019s beliefs about the \nexistence of that constraint; the possibility of social events, on the contrary, depends in \npart on beliefs about their possibility. Specifically, the possibility of global democracy \nmay not be independent from people\u2019s beliefs about the possibility of global democracy. \nThe issue of recursivity is just one of the reasons why many social scientists are \nsceptical about the notion of \u2018social laws\u2019. The debate on this issue is intense and \ncomplex8, but fortunately it does not have to be resolved here, because the question of \nempirical possibility can be approached in a way that does not require reliance on the \nconcept of social laws. This is because that question often takes the form of arguments \nabout necessary conditions: social facts or events are deemed to require other facts or \nevents in order to occur. Social scientists routinely advance arguments of this kind: \nGoertz (2003), for instance, cites 150 examples of necessary condition hypotheses \ndiscussed in political science, sociology and economic history.  \n This article thus adopts the following working definition of empirical \npossibility: a not-yet-observed phenomenon can be considered possible except when its \nemergence would violate a necessary condition hypothesis that has been supported, \nhowever tentatively and provisionally, by empirical research.  \n Which necessary condition hypotheses are relevant for the assessment of the \npossibility of global democracy? I argue that two broad sets of hypotheses are especially \nimportant. The first set consists of hypotheses on necessary conditions for democracy. \n 8 \nSince the highest governance level in which democracy has emerged so far is the state \n(with the possible exception of the European Union), the main source of data on \nnecessary conditions for democracy consists of the pool of national experiences with \ndemocratization. If it can be shown that countries experiencing successful transitions to \ndemocracy did so only in the presence of certain \u2018prerequisites\u2019, and that these \nprerequisites are lacking at the international level, now and in the foreseeable future, \nthen this would provide strong reasons to believe that global democracy is impossible. \n The second important set of necessary condition hypotheses concerns \ninternational structural change. For reasons that will be clarified in the next section, \nglobal democracy would require a process of concentration of power capabilities and \nauthority in the international system, i.e. a shift from anarchy to polity. If it can be \nshown that international systems only ever changed as a result of certain conditions \n(notably self-help imperatives and competitive power politics), and that these conditions \ncannot generate a global democratic polity, then this would provide strong reasons to \nbelieve that global democracy is impossible. \n Both sets of necessary condition hypotheses focus on structural dimensions. This \nis consistent with an interpretation of structural analysis as an inquiry into the \nconditions of possibility for social events to occur (Wight, 2006: 279-289). The \nconcluding section will discuss the implications of the findings for the development of a \nmore agent-oriented investigation of pathways to global democracy. \n The rest of the article aims at assessing these two sets of necessary conditions \nhypotheses and is organized as follows. The next section investigates whether any \ncondition can be considered necessary for democratic transitions and concludes that \nonly a certain degree of political centralization qualifies as a genuinely necessary \ncondition for democracy. Section 4 focuses on that condition and assesses whether its \nemergence at the global level would violate any necessary condition for international \nsystemic change. \n    \n3. Necessary conditions for democracy \nThis section assesses the comparative politics literature in order to identify necessary \nconditions for democratic transitions. As noted above, if any condition is identified as \n 9 \nnecessary in the domestic context, it is useful to ask whether it can be found at the \ninternational level. If any necessary condition is identified that is not present and cannot \nbe replicated at the international level, this would provide an argument for the \nimpossibility of global democracy. The section starts by examining whether any \nfavourable condition for democracy can also be considered a necessary condition in the \nlight of historical experiences, and then considers in greater detail whether transitions to \ndemocracy require any of the following conditions that are arguably absent at the global \nlevel: the existence of a state; high levels of cultural homogeneity; high levels of \neconomic prosperity; low levels of economic inequality; and a polity of small or \nmoderate size.  \n \n3.1. Necessary v. favourable conditions \nMost literature on democratization is not concerned primarily with necessary \nconditions, but with conditions that are positively or negatively associated with \ndemocracy and could have a causal role in facilitating or hindering its development and \ndurability. This way of framing the question resonates with the probabilistic character of \nmost theorizing in political science. Indeed, Seymour Martin Lipset (1959) started his \nseminal article on the \u2018social requisites\u2019 of democracy by criticizing the tendency to \ndismiss hypotheses on the basis of deviant cases that can only disprove arguments of \ncausal necessity, not causality as such. For the purposes of this article, however, it is \nimportant to distinguish carefully between those conditions that appear to be positively \nassociated with either the likelihood of democracy or the quality of democracy on the \none hand, and those conditions that have to be present for democracy to occur. Only the \nabsence of the latter conditions at the global level would support the conclusion that \nglobal democracy is impossible rather than merely unlikely. \n Even scholars who emphasise the importance of structure rather than agency in \ndemocratization processes usually avoid presenting their preferred conditions as \n\u2018necessary\u2019. For instance, the \u2018crucial\u2019 explanatory variable in the influential \ncomparative historical study of Dietrich Rueschemeyer, Evelyne Huber Stephens and \nJohn D. Stephens (1992) is the relative size and density of the industrial working class, \nbut their case studies reveal several exceptions to the general pattern, notably the \n\u2018agrarian democracies\u2019 of the early United States, Switzerland, and Norway. Similar \n 10 \nfindings emerge also from quantitative studies. Vanhanen (2003), for instance, \nhypothesises that \u2018resource distribution\u2019 is the key explanatory factor for \ndemocratization and applies regression analysis to 170 countries to estimate at which \nlevel of resource distribution countries are expected to pass the threshold of democracy. \nHe presents his hypotheses as probabilistic, and despite the strong statistical and \nsubstantive significance of his explanatory variable (which appears to account for 70 per \ncent of variance in democracy), there are several countries with large positive or \nnegative residuals, which contradict the hypothesis. Out of 170 countries, 11 are \ndemocracies despite the fact that their level of resource distribution is below the posited \ntransition level (Vanhanen, 2003: 138) - a finding that can be interpreted as ruling out \nresource distribution as a necessary condition of democracy. \n A particularly systematic search for necessary conditions is performed by \nCarsten Q. Schneider and Claudius Wagemann (2006), who examined 32 countries \nfrom six world regions that underwent a regime transition between 1974 and 2000.  \nUsing a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative method, they assess whether any of the \nfollowing sociocultural, economic and historical features of the countries constitutes a \nnecessary and\/or sufficient condition for democratic consolidation: level of economic \ndevelopment, level of education, degree of ethno-linguistic homogeneity, distance to the \nWest, degree of previous democratic experiences and extent of communist past. They \nconclude that \u2018there are no necessary preconditions for [the consolidation of \ndemocracy]. Instead, some democracies consolidate in unfavourable conditions, while \nothers fail to consolidate in favourable contexts.\u2019 (Schneider and Wagemann, 2006).  \n This brief overview suggests that scholars have been able to identify a number \nof conditions under which democracy is more likely to thrive, but that the quest for \nnecessary conditions has been less successful \u2013 even conditions that some analysts \nregard as highly favourable fail to qualify as genuinely necessary conditions. However, \nfive arguments deserve closer scrutiny as they have been invoked to question the \npossibility of global democracy.9 They are: (a) democracy is possible only in a state; (b) \ncultural heterogeneity in the world is an insurmountable obstacle to democracy; (c) most \nof the world is too poor to allow the emergence of democratic institutions; (d) \ndemocracy at the global level could not work because of the huge differences in the \neconomic conditions of the world\u2019s inhabitants, and (e) the world is too large to allow \n 11 \nthe establishment of democratic institutions. These arguments will be considered in \nturn. \n \n3.2. Stateness \nJuan J. Linz and Alfred Stepan (1996: 17) argue that \u2018[d]emocracy is a form of \ngovernance of a modern state. Thus, without a state, no modern democracy is possible\u2019. \nWhile this argument comes close to being tautological (democracy appears to be defined \nas an attribute of a state), they also suggest some substantive reasons for the link \nbetween statehood and democracy: \u2018Democracy is a form of governance of life in a \npolis in which citizens have rights that are guaranteed and protected. To protect the \nrights of its citizens and to deliver the other basic services that citizens demand, a \ndemocratic government needs to be able to exercise effectively its claim to the \nmonopoly of the legitimate use of force in the territory.\u2019 (Linz and Stepan, 1996: 10-\n11). In other words, the argument is that democracy requires a \u2018Weberian\u2019 effective \nmonopoly of force to secure citizen\u2019s rights and the ability to extract resources to \nperform this function.  \n Two issues should be considered in the assessment of this \u2018no state, no \ndemocracy\u2019 thesis. First, governments do not necessarily lose their overall democratic \ncharacter when their control of part of the state territory is challenged by armed groups. \nThe British, Spanish, Turkish, and Indian governments fought against secessionist \narmed groups during the past thirty years while preserving their broadly democratic \ninstitutions. However, democratic processes are usually suspended in the regions where \narmed conflict is most intense, ands this suggests that either governments succeed in \ncircumscribing the spread of armed resistance or democracy is likely to be brought to an \nend. \n Second, it is not clear that, historically, a monopoly of the legitimate use of force \nhas been a necessary condition for democracy to emerge. The historical experience of \nthe United States is revealing in several ways. Most accounts of democracy in the \nUnited States classify the North and West of the country as a restricted democracy from \nits colonial origins to the 1820s and as a full democracy thereafter, while the South is \nconsidered a constitutional oligarchy or restricted democracy until the Voting Rights \nAct of 1965 (Rueschemeyer et al., 1992: 122). At the same time, some analysts deny \n 12 \nthat the United States can be considered a \u2018state\u2019 before the war of 1861-1865. Daniel \nDeudney argues instead that it constituted a \u2018Philadelphian System\u2019, that is, a distinctive \nstates-union consisting of semi-autonomous republics in which power was more \nconcentrated than it would be in a confederation but less than in a Westphalian state. \n\u2018With the armed citizenry institutionalized, the central government of the Union \nexplicitly lacked a monopoly of violence capability and of legitimate violence authority\u2019 \n(Deudney, 2007: 178).  \n The early United States may thus be an example of \u2018stateless democracy\u2019. But its \nlow level of stateness may also be considered a reason why democracy remained \nrestricted in parts of the country, before and after the civil war. Francisco E. Gonzalez \nand Desmond King (2004), for instance, argue that the limited presence of the federal \ngovernment in the Southern states before the New Deal permitted local violations of the \nrights of citizenship and undermined democracy. \n This example suggests that the impact of various degrees of stateness on \ndemocracy seems to depend on a number of circumstances. In any case, we should not \nconclude that the legal rules produced by a political unit can be enforced only when the \nunit possesses the key attributes of statehood, notably a monopoly of the legitimate use \nof force and bureaucratic control over a territorial jurisdiction. Michael Z\u00fcrn and his \ncolleagues (2005) show systematically that the experience of the EU disconfirms the \nthesis that a central monopoly of force is necessary to ensure high levels of compliance \nwith the law. \n In conclusion, a certain level of political centralization \u2013 a polity \u2013 can be seen \nas necessary for the democratization of political life, because democratic rights of \nparticipation (input) as well as compliance with democratic decisions (output) need to \nbe secured. The required level falls short of a complete monopoly of the legitimate use \nof coercion \u2013 that is, full stateness. But it is higher than the degree of political \ncentralization that exists at the global level today. The question of the conditions under \nwhich a global polity can emerge therefore becomes crucial to the problem of whether \ndemocracy is possible beyond the state. That question is examined in part 4, after other \nconditions for democracy are considered in the remainder of part 3. \n \n 13 \n3.3. Cultural homogeneity \nJohn Stuart Mill famously declared that \u2018Free institutions are next to impossible in a \ncountry made up of different nationalities. Among a people without fellow-feeling, \nespecially if they read and speak different languages, the united public opinion, \nnecessary to the working of representative government, cannot exist\u2019 (Mill, 1991: 428). \nThe most systematic analysis of the relationship between diversity and democracy, \nhowever, finds no evidence of a negative impact of the former on the latter. M. Steven \nFish and Robin S. Brooks (2004) use a recently complied database to assess the impact \nof three dimensions of fractionalization (ethnic, linguistic and religious) on democracy \nin 166 countries. Controlling for other factors such as GDP, neither ethnic nor linguistic \nnor religious fractionalization has a statistically or substantively significant impact on \ndemocracy. They conclude that \u2018the degree of diversity is not shown to influence \ndemocracy\u2019s prospects.\u2019  (Fish and Brooks, 2004: 160). Nor do they find evidence that \nfractionalization is statistically related to the presence of democracy in low-income \ncountries.  \n    \n \n \n \n3.4. Economic prosperity \nLipset\u2019s argument that \u2018the more well-to-do a nation, the greater the chances that it will \nsustain democracy\u2019 (Lipset, 1959: 75) proved extremely influential in the following \ndecades as part of a broader set of hypotheses known as \u2018modernization theory\u2019. The \nlink between economic development and democracy is usually conceived as \nprobabilistic rather than in terms of a minimum threshold of wealth being necessary for \ndemocratization. Indeed, a \u2018surprising number of poor and underdeveloped countries \nexhibit democratic institutions\u2019 (Clague et al., 2001: 17). But even the probabilistic \nconjecture that economic development increases the chances of democratization has \nbeen dealt a strong blow by recent research. In their landmark statistical study on data \nfrom 1950 to 1990, Przeworki and Limongi (1997) showed that the level of economic \ndevelopment has no effect on democratization.10 Democracies can emerge at almost any \nlevel of per capita income. \n 14 \n In a similar vein and using an index of resource distribution that includes per \ncapita GDP, Vanhanen finds that there is no value of that index below which \ndemocratization never occurs, and indeed many countries crossed the threshold of \ndemocracy despite extremely low per capita incomes. His conclusion is that \u2018[p]overty \nas such does not seem to constitute an insurmountable obstacle for democratization\u2019 \n(Vanhanen, 2003: 136). However, it appears that economic development makes \ndemocracies endure, once they have been established for other reasons. Przeworski and \nLimongi\u2019s data show that the richer a democracy, the lower the likelihood that it will be \nreplaced by a non-democratic regime. But even current wealth is not decisive: \u2018If they \nsucceed in generating development, democracies can survive even in the poorest \nnations.\u2019 (Przeworski and Limongi, 1997: 176). These findings suggest that global \npoverty does not in itself forestall the transition to a democratic global polity, but the \nperpetuation of poverty would endanger its consolidation.  \n   \n3.5. Economic inequality \nSeveral scholars have explored the link between economic inequality and political \ndemocracy. For instance, Dietrich Rueschemeyer (2004) provides an insightful \ndiscussion of the negative impact of inequality on the quality of democracy, while \nEdward N. Muller (1995) examined the statistical evidence and concluded that income \ninequality hinders democratization. \n For Vanhanen income inequality is one of the components of a more \nfundamental variable: resource distribution. He maintains that \u2018democratization takes \nplace under conditions in which power resources have become so widely distributed that \nno group is any longer able to suppress its competitors or to maintain its hegemony\u2019 \n(Vanhanen, 2003: 29). As noted above, he finds that his \u2018resource distribution\u2019 variable \nexplains 70 per cent of the variation in his index of democracy. However, Vanhanen \nfinds eleven countries that are democracies despite having a resource distribution below \nwhat he identifies as the transition level (Vanhanen, 2003: 138), and this finding can be \ninterpreted as ruling out resource distribution as a necessary condition of democracy in \na country.  \n The three countries with the world\u2019s highest Gini coefficients of inequality are \nclassified as \u2018free\u2019 by Freedom House (Namibia, Lesotho and Botswana). Other \n 15 \ndemocratic countries with very high levels of income or consumption inequality are \nBrazil (Gini of 59.1 in 1998), South Africa (Gini of 59.3 in 1995), and Chile (Gini of \n57.1 in 2000) (UNDP 2004: 188-191) This data indicates that the world\u2019s most unequal \ndemocracies have almost the same level of economic inequality as the world as a whole, \nwhich is estimated to have had a Gini coefficient of 64 in 1998 (Milanovic, 2005). In \nother words, economic inequality may affect negatively the quality of democracy, but \nhaving the same degree of inequality that one finds at the global level has not prevented \na number of countries from developing and maintaining democratic political \ninstitutions.  \n \n3.6. Size \nMontesquieu famously maintained that \u2018It is natural for a republic to have only a small \nterritory; otherwise it cannot long subsist.\u2019 In the Federalist Papers, James Madison \nfamously retorted that, on the contrary, large republics were more stable because of \ntheir superior ability to control the perils of factions. Could size as such represent a \nbarrier to the expansion of democracy at a global scale? The question has two \ndimensions. The first dimension concerns the problem of the shrinking political \ninfluence of each individual citizen as the overall number of citizens in a polity \nincreases. As Dahl and Tufte (1973) argued, democracy requires not only \u2018citizen \neffectiveness\u2019 but also \u2018system capacity\u2019, i.e. the polity\u2019s ability to respond to the \ncollective preferences of its citizens. Hence, a \u2018rational or reasonable democrat who \nwished to maximize the chances of attaining certain of his goals might well trade some \nloss of personal effectiveness for some gain in the capacity of the system to attain them\u2019 \n(Dahl and Tufte, 1973: 23). In some cases, it may be impossible or very costly to \nprevent decisions made in one independent jurisdiction from affecting the welfare of \npeople in other jurisdictions \u2013 the emission of greenhouse gases is a clear example of \n\u2018unavoidable\u2019 globalization. In such cases, a \u2018reasonable democrat\u2019 may well judge that \nthe overall level of popular control would be higher under a political arrangement where \nindividual citizens have a weak influence on a fairly effective global polity than under a \npolitical arrangement where individual citizens have a stronger influence on a relatively \npowerless national polity. It seems that the gains and losses of democratic control need \nto be assessed case by case. \n 16 \n The second dimension of the question concerns the ability of democratic \ninstitutions, and specifically electoral institutions, to function when the size of the polity \nbecomes very large. If democratic institutions become impossible beyond a certain size, \nit would make no democratic sense to trade citizen effectiveness for any additional \ndegree of system effectiveness. Several authors have examined the statistical \nrelationship between size and the emergence or survival of democratic institutions. No \nuniform picture emerges from these studies: the sign, the statistical significance and the \nmagnitude of the relationship all vary depending on how the explanatory and outcome \nvariables are conceptualized and measured, on which control variables are included, and \non which countries and years are considered.11 The most comprehensive statistical \nanalysis to date has been published by Andrew Rose (2006), who used a panel dataset of \nover 200 countries between 1960 and 2000. In regression models that include 27 control \nvariables that may affect democracy, Rose finds that larger size has a positive and \nstatistically significant effect on democracy as measured by the Polity IV project, a \npositive and statistically significant effect on political rights as measured by Freedom \nHouse, and a positive and (in the instrumental variable model) statistically significant \neffect on civil liberties as measured by Freedom House. On the other hand, the \nrelationship between size and the Voice and Accountability score from the World \nBank\u2019s Worldwide Governance Indicators is negative, but not statistically significant. \nThese findings cast doubt on the idea that the size of a polity is inversely related to its \nability to generate and sustain democratic institutions. A fortiori, the evidence does not \nsuggest that a small or moderate polity size is a necessary condition for democracy.  \n \n3.7. The Indian experience \nIt could be argued that none of the factors just considered is a necessary condition for \ndemocratization, but that the simultaneous lack of several of them is an insurmountable \nobstacle to democratization. India challenges this argument, as it lacks most of the \nconditions considered thus far, and yet it represents a remarkable example of democratic \ntransition and consolidation.  \n Atul Kohli (2001: 1) points out that \u2018[t]he success of India\u2019s democracy defies \nmany prevailing theories that stipulate preconditions for democracy.\u2019 Despite significant \nadvances in recent years, India still has high levels of poverty and low levels of human \n 17 \ndevelopment. The Human Development Index for 2006 gives India a rank of 126th out \nof 177 countries with data. In 2004, nearly forty per cent of all adults (and over half of \nall women) were illiterate. Twenty per cent of the population is undernourished, i.e. \ntheir food intake is chronically insufficient to meet their minimum energy requirements, \nand nearly half of all children under 5 are underweight. Between 1990 and 2003, one \nthird of the population lived with less than $1 a day and eighty percent with less than \n$2. Nearly thirty per cent lived below the official poverty line determined by the Indian \nauthorities (HDR 2006). While the level of economic inequality (as measured by the \nGini coefficient) is not significantly higher than in most rich democracies, social \nequality is severely constrained by the caste system, which has a strong impact on life \nchances, especially in rural areas (Mendelsohn and Vicziany, 1998) . \n Not only India\u2019s size (nearly 1.2 billion citizens, over 700 million eligible voters \nwith almost 60 per cent turnout in the general elections of 2009), but also its degree of \ncultural heterogeneity is considerable. For Arend Lijphart \u2018[t]here can be little doubt \nthat among the world\u2019s democracies, India is the most extreme plural society\u2019 (Lijphart, \n2007: 24). Linz and his colleagues also describe India as \u2018the world\u2019s most diverse \ndemocracy\u2019 (Linz et al., 2007: 71). One prominent dimension of this diversity is \nlanguage pluralism. According to the 1991 Census, the main language of about 40 per \ncent of India\u2019s population is Hindi, while eleven more languages have between 13 and \n70 million speakers each. Ten more languages are spoken by more than one million \npeople, while the total number of separate languages captured by the Census is 114, a \nfigure obtained by rationalizing and classifying over 10,000 \u2018mother tongues\u2019 declared \nby Census respondents. Nearly twenty per cent of Indians were bilingual in 1991 (up \nfrom 9.7 per cent in 1961) and around seven per cent were trilingual (Office of the \nRegistrar General, 2002). \n The Indian experience is particularly significant because it helps assess \narguments about the interaction of potential necessary conditions. For instance, it could \nbe argued that, despite the findings reported in section 3.3, cultural homogeneity may be \na necessary condition for democracy when the average citizen is poor; or that, despite \nthe findings reported in section 3.4 economic prosperity may be a necessary condition \nfor democracy when the polity is large. Indian democracy contradicts all these \nhypotheses, as it emerged and survived in the context of high levels of cultural \n 18 \nheterogeneity, low per capita incomes, high levels of inequality, and huge population \nsizes. \n \n4. Necessary conditions for polity formation \nThe previous section examined a range of necessary conditions hypotheses on the \nemergence of democracy. In most cases, it found that either the conditions were not \ngenuinely necessary to democracy, or that they were already present at the global level. \nSpecifically, it found that a polity does not need to be culturally homogeneous, wealthy, \nand economically egalitarian in order to develop democratic institutions. In comparison \nwith the other potentially necessary conditions considered in section 3, the discussion of \nstateness was less conclusive. A certain degree of concentration of political power is \nlogically implied by the notion of democracy: democracy is not only about demos but \nalso about kratos. As argued in section 3.2., an additional amount of power \nconcentration may be empirically necessary to democracy: without it, citizens may be \nleft at the mercy of private power-holders and unable to exercise in practice their formal \nrights of equal citizenship. What is less clear is whether the necessary level of power \nconcentration amounts to a full monopoly of the legitimate use of force - in other words, \nfull stateness. The examples of the early United States and the European Union \nmentioned in section 3.2 suggest that this monopoly is not necessary for ensuring \ncompliance with political decisions and protecting citizen rights. For this reason, I refer \nto the institutional infrastructure of global democracy by using the more general term \n\u2018polity\u2019 rather than the more specific term \u2018state\u2019. This global polity must have a degree \nof power concentration that is sufficient to ensure the monitoring and active promotion \nof (1) effective chains of representation, delegation and accountability that link the \npolity with the citizens in all regions of the world, and (2) local compliance with the \ndecisions taken democratically at the global level. In other words, the polity must fulfil \ncertain requirements relating to the \u2018input\u2019 side as well as the \u2018output\u2019 side of the \npolitical process. \n The level of political centralization required to perform those functions \neffectively is significantly higher than what we find today in the global system taken as \n 19 \na whole. The remainder of this article addresses the argument that such a level of \npolitical centralization cannot emerge in the international system. More specifically, it \nconsiders whether world politics can be transformed in ways that do not conform to the \nalleged imperatives of self-help under anarchy. \n The argument proceeds in two steps. First, I point out that world politics is \ncharacterized by a variety of structural and institutional forms rather than a constant and \nimmutable state of anarchy. Second, I argue that changes from one form to another are \nnot propelled exclusively by the logics of aggression and self-help in a threatening \nsecurity environment. This argument casts doubt on the proposition that systemic \nchanges necessarily preserve interstate anarchy as self-help, which is one of the crucial \npoints made by IR scholars working within the Realist tradition (see for instance the \nstatements quoted in the introduction). \n Within the broad constraints indicated above, a global democratic polity could \nbe located at various points on a continuum from anarchy to stateness. Even Kenneth \nWaltz, whose theory is based on the distinction between anarchy and hierarchy as types \nof structure, acknowledged that in reality \u2018[a]ll societies are mixed\u2019 (Waltz, 1979: 116). \nOther authors have identified a large number of theoretically conceivable and \nempirically existing political orders between the polar opposites of anarchy and unitary \nstatehood. For instance, Jack Donnelly (2006: 154) presents ten systems of \u2018hierarchy in \nanarchy\u2019: balance of power, protection, concert, collective security, hegemony, \ndominion, empire, pluralistic security community, common security community and \namalgamated security community.  \n Sceptics may concede that a variety of polities between the extremes of anarchy \nand stateness are empirically possible, but still rule out that any polity encompassing the \nglobe could have democratic attributes. The Realist interpretation of world politics \nprovides reasons why any emerging global polity would not be democratic. In the words \nof one of its foremost theorists, according to the Realist school of thought \u2018a state is \ncompelled within the anarchic and competitive conditions of international relations to \nexpand its power and attempt to extend its control over the international system. If the \nstate fails to make this attempt, it risks the possibility that other states will increase their \nrelative power positions and will thereby place its existence or vital interests in \njeopardy.\u2019 (Gilpin, 1981: 86-87).  \n 20 \n Waltz has stressed the constraining role of anarchic structures, which promote \nbalance-of-power behaviour through socialization (emulation of the most successful \npractices) and competition (elimination of units that do not respond to structural \nincentives) (Waltz, 1979: 74). For Neorealist theory, the reproduction of balance-of-\npower behaviour is not driven primarily by the rationality of decision-makers, but \nprincipally by \u2018the process of selection that takes place in competitive systems\u2019 (Waltz, \n1986: 330). States that fail to conform to structural imperatives will eventually \u2018fall by \nthe wayside\u2019 and the behaviour of all units will converge towards Realpolitik methods \n(Waltz, 1979: 117-8). \n If this interpretation is correct, we should expect that any shift from anarchy to \npolity can occur only as a result of either (1) the conquest or subjugation of one polity \nby another or (2) the voluntary unification of two or more polities to forestall conquest \nor subjugation by a powerful third party. The first path could in principle lead to a \nglobal polity, but its form of governance would be imperial rather than democratic.12 \nThe second path could produce a democratic polity, but this polity could never \nencompass the whole world because there would be no threatening third party left to \ntrigger unification. Moreover, this new polity would find itself in a state of anarchy vis-\n\u00e0-vis other states and be compelled to \u2018play the game of power politics\u2019 in order to \nsurvive. In short, for Realism there is no path leading to a global democratic polity. \n However, in reality shifts along the anarchy-polity continuum do not occur \nexclusively as a result of self-help imperatives and competitive power politics, although \nthese are certainly important factors in many circumstances. Shifts can also result from \npolitical agency propelled by interests that are defined in economic or normative ways. \nTheoretical as well as empirical considerations point at the inadequacy of a strictly \nRealist-structural interpretation of international change.  \n Examining theoretical issues first, three of them are particularly relevant. First, \nvarious scholars have criticized the idea of a necessary relationship between anarchical \nstructure and competitive behaviour. They have argued that the absence of a supra-\nordinate authority is compatible with a variety of patterns of interaction among \nindependent states. This theme has been developed extensively by the English school \n(e.g. Bull, 1977; Buzan, 2004). Wendt (1999) developed a particularly influential \nversion of the argument that \u2018anarchy is what states make of it\u2019, which maintains that \n 21 \nthe character of interstate relations is determined by the beliefs and expectations that \nstates have about each other. In this interpretation, the effect of material power \nstructures is crucially mediated by the social structure of the system, which can take \nthree forms \u2013 Hobbesian, Lockean and Kantian \u2013 depending on what kind of roles are \npredominant in the system: enemy, rival or friend.  \n Second, Constructivists maintain that \u2018[a]ny given international system does not \nexist because of immutable structures, but rather the very structures are dependent for \ntheir reproduction on the practices of the actors. Fundamental change of the \ninternational system occurs when actors, through their practices, change the rules and \nnorms constitutive of international interaction\u2019 (Koslowski and Kratochwil, 1994: 216). \nWendt stresses that social structures may be more difficult to change than material \nstructures but, crucially, transformations of the character of international life can occur \nthrough processes that are not derivative from shifting balances of material power. \n\u2018Although there is no 1:1 correspondence between positions in the idealism-materialism \ndebate and beliefs about the ease of social change, showing that seemingly material \nconditions are actually a function of how actors think about them opens up possibilities \nfor intervention that would otherwise be obscured.\u2019 (Wendt, 1999: 371). In his \ndiscussion of mechanisms of change, Wendt argues that natural selection and \ncompetition for scarce resources have lost most of their explanatory power since the \nadvent of the Westphalian system in the seventeenth century, and that imitation and \nespecially social learning have become the main drivers of structural change in modern \ninternational relations. Realists disagree on the obsolescence of competitive selection, \nbut the crucial point for the purposes of this article is that the Realist account of \nstructural change faces powerful theoretical competitors.  \n Third, social processes may alter not only the culture of anarchy but the fact of \nanarchy itself. Both Waltz (1979: 126) and Wendt (1999: 235) regard \u2018survival\u2019 as an \nintrinsic interest of states. However, this interest cannot be taken for granted, especially \nif forms of suprastate political organization are conceptualized as a continuum rather \nthan a dichotomy between undiluted sovereignty and subjugation to an external \nauthority (Paul, 1999; Koenig-Archibugi, 2004a). Corporate identities can and should \nbe endogenized (Cederman and Daase, 2003). \n 22 \n The extensive debate generated by the English School and Constructivist \nchallenges to the Realist interpretation of international change and stability cannot be \nassessed here. What is of central importance for the question addressed in this article is \nthat English school theory and Constructivism have provided solid ground for the \ntheoretical possibility of fundamental transformations driven by processes that are \ndifferent from competition for material supremacy and survival. The rest of this section \naims to show that shifts along the anarchy-polity continuum pushed by economic and \nnormative factors are also an empirical possibility by mentioning two examples. The \nfirst one is the dissolution of colonial empires after World War II, which can be \ndescribed as a shift towards anarchy. The second one is European integration, which is a \nshift away from anarchy. Neither can be considered as the outcome of self-help \nbehaviour under anarchy. \n Approximately a third of the world\u2019s population lived under colonial rule in \n1939. Barely forty years later, colonial rule extended only over a few small and \nscattered territories. For K. J. Holsti (2004: 274) the obsolescence of colonialism as an \ninstitution \u2018ranks as one of the most important processes in international politics during \nthe twentieth century, with consequences that are in many ways more significant than \nthose of globalization or the declining significance of territoriality\u2019. \n Post-WWII decolonization was a massive process of polity disaggregation that \ncannot be explained merely with reference to the logic of power competition in a self-\nhelp system. Many colonies gained independence consensually, on the basis of \nnegotiated settlements, rather than as a result of military defeat. Diehl and Goertz \n(1991) examined 121 cases of national independence between 1816 and 1980 and found \nthat only 23 cases (about 20 per cent) were preceded or accompanied by fighting \nbetween indigenous and imperial military forces, and moreover that such fighting was \ncomparatively rare after 1950. Goldsmith and He (2008) examined every state that \nachieved independence between 1900 and 1994 and its relationship with its (former) \ncolonial power during the seven years before and seven years after independence, and \nfound that war between imperial and indigenous military forces occurred in less than \nfour per cent of those years. This suggests that, despite the importance of armed \nconflicts in a number of colonial dependencies, overall they cannot be considered a \nnecessary condition for the end of colonial rule. It could be argued that the mere \n 23 \nexpectation of war and defeat at the hand of national liberation armies may have \ntriggered peaceful decolonization. But in fact many historians of decolonization reject \nexplanations that attribute a decisive role to shifting balances of military and material \npower between imperial centres and peripheries with regard to most areas.13. Nor do \nthey regard the military decline of the imperial powers in comparison to the United \nStates and the Soviet Union as a necessary or sufficient condition for decolonization.14 \nThe end of the European overseas empires was the result of the conjunction of several \ncauses, whose relative importance and interplay in each case depended on a variety of \ncircumstances (Holsti, 2004: 263-274; Darwin, 1991). But in general an important role \nwas played by shifting balances of ideational power, and specifically by the decline of \nthe legitimacy of colonialism as an institution, which in turn was related to the \ntransnational diffusion and influence of ideas about national self-determination and \nracial equality.15  \n If decolonization \u2013 \u2018the greatest explosion of state creation in world history\u2019 \n(Holsti, 2004: 273) \u2013 can be considered a shift away from polity and towards anarchy, \nEuropean integration is a movement in the opposite direction. The scholarly debate on \nthe driving forces of European integration is intense and far from resolved. What is \nrelevant here is whether the Realist understanding of the necessary conditions for polity \nformation can account for this process. The desire to pool resources to face the Soviet \nthreat may have played a role in promoting the early steps of integration, and geo-\neconomic competition against the USA and Japan may have played a similar role in \nlater stages. But many initiatives that resulted in further political integration cannot be \nunderstood simply as means to strengthen EU member states in their competition for \npower and survival within an anarchical global system. Instead of trying to summarize \nthe many decisions on institutions and policies that produced the European Union in its \npresent form, I will consider only one set of decisions that increased substantially the \n\u2018polity\u2019 nature of the EU: the delegation of significant legislative, budgetary and \nsupervision powers from the member states to a supranational body directly elected by \nEuropean citizens.  \n Since its birth as Common Assembly of the European Coal and Steel \nCommunity in 1952, the European Parliament has evolved from a \u2018talking-shop\u2019 to a \nkey participant in the political process of the world\u2019s most integrated supranational \n 24 \norganization. As a result of formal agreements among member states and parliamentary \npractices, \u2018it is not unreasonable to say that the European Parliament is one of the most \npowerful legislative chambers in the world\u2019 (Hix et al., 2007: 21). The increase of the \nEP\u2019s role was not a result of global anarchy. While in some cases the \nparliamentarization of the European Union has increased the efficiency of the decision-\nmaking process in the EU (and thus may have indirectly contributed to the EU\u2019s global \ncompetitiveness), in other cases efficiency has been reduced (Rittberger, 2005: 21). \n The willingness of governments to delegate substantial powers to a body whose \npreferences and decisions they cannot control is best explained by concerns about the \ndemocratic legitimacy of the EU.  Political elites were aware that pooling decision-\nmaking power at the European level involved a reduction in the control exercised by \nnational parliaments. While this may have been welcome in some cases (Koenig-\nArchibugi, 2004b), the trend towards de-parliamentarization raised concerns that the \ngains produced by European integration would come at the expense of the procedural \nrequirements of parliamentary democracy. Berthold Rittberger shows that the decision \nto create and empower a parliamentary institution in the European Community resulted \nfrom the perception that there was a democratic legitimacy deficit that could and should \nbe alleviated (Rittberger, 2005: 204).  \n Twentieth-century decolonization and the parliamentarization of the European \nUnion are undoubtedly two very different processes, but both lend support to two key \npropositions. First, shifts along the anarchy-polity continuum are conceptually and \nempirically possible. Second, such shifts are not necessarily propelled by the \nimperatives of competitive self-help within wider anarchical structures and are not \nnecessarily functional to reproducing those anarchical structures. They can be produced \nby normative commitments as well as a variety of economic and security interests that \nare not necessarily competitive. The theory and practice of international politics offers \nno compelling reason to rule out changes in the direction of a global democratic polity.  \n \n5. Conclusions \nThis article has argued that what we know about the democratization of states and the \nconditions of polity formation at the international level does not lend support to the \n 25 \nclaim that global democracy is impossible. While the emergence of democracy within \ncountries is a difficult and in many ways a historically unlikely process, attempts at \nidentifying universally valid necessary conditions for democratic transitions have been \nless than successful. Multiple paths to democracy exist, and recognizing that some \ncircumstances are much more favourable to democratization than others is different \nfrom positing strict preconditions. While a certain level of political centralization \u2013 the \nexistence of a polity \u2013 seems logically and empirically necessary for democracy, a \ncomplete centralization of the means of coercion is not. Furthermore, the findings of \ninternational relations scholarship disconfirm the Realist view that shifts along the \ncontinuum from anarchy to polity are possible only as a result of the threat or exercise \nof violence. Anarchy does not invariably punish with subjugation those states that aim \nat voluntary integration with other states. These results put into question the claim that \npolities can be either global or democratic, but not both. \n These conclusions concern historical possibility and nothing in this article \nshould be interpreted as suggesting that the emergence of global democracy is likely in \nthe near or distant future, if compared with other scenarios for future world order. Some \nauthors have argued that a world state is likely or even \u2018inevitable\u2019, albeit in a long-term \nperspective (Wendt, 2003; Carneiro, 2004). The argument made here differs \nfundamentally from such forecasts, since it is compatible with the view that the \ntransition to global democracy is a very unlikely event.  \n On the other hand, some of the findings discussed in this article could also \nsuggest that the likelihood of global democracy may be substantially higher than zero \neven under present conditions \u2013 for instance, the finding that there is no significant \ncorrelation between a state\u2019s chance to democratize and its level of ethnic, linguistic and \nreligious diversity, or its per capita income; or the finding that larger countries appear \nmore likely to have democratic institutions than smaller ones; or the fact that a concern \nabout the democratic deficit of EU governance explains at least in part why European \nstates shared decision-making powers not only among themselves but also with a \nsupranational parliamentary institution over which they retained no control. Statistical \n\u2018out-of-sample\u2019 estimation techniques may even allow us to perform a daring thought-\nexperiment: if the world were a country, how likely would it be to experience a \ntransition to democracy, given its level of cultural, ethnic and linguistic diversity, its \n 26 \nlevel of economic prosperity and economic inequality, the size of its population, and \nother variables of interest?  \n The results of such an exercise may be intriguing, but perhaps the best lesson to \nbe drawn from the difficulty of finding any strictly necessary non-trivial preconditions \nfor democratic development may be that, in assessing the prospects for global \ndemocracy, the analysis of structures can only go so far. As noted in section 2, this \narticle has focused on (domestic and international) structures because they provide \ninsights on the conditions of possibility for social events to occur (Wight, 2006: 279-\n289). However, any account of how global democracy might come about would need to \nexplore potential combinations of structures and agency. In the study of democratic \ntransitions within countries, approaches that emphasise the role of agency have allowed \nresearchers to understand dynamics and outcomes that were puzzling from a structure-\noriented perspective (e.g., Mahoney and Snyder, 1999); and agency-oriented analyses of \nstrategic and communicative action by political entrepreneurs revealed that they can \nmodify important features of global politics (e.g., Evangelista, 1999; Crawford 2002; \nLegro, 2005). Combining creatively the insights of these areas of scholarship, and \nthinking systematically about different pathways to global democracy, may be the best \nway in which empirical political science can contribute to intellectual and political \ndebates on a more inclusive and just world order.   \n In response to assertions about the presumed inevitability of globalization, \nRobert Dahl (1999: 34) commented that \u2018The last three centuries are a graveyard packed \nwith the corpses of \u201cinevitable\u201d developments\u2019. Claims that all paths to global \ndemocracy are blocked by the lack of inevitable \u2018prerequisites\u2019 should be approached \nwith the same sceptical outlook, since world politics is clearly capable of surprising \neven the most disenchanted observers. 16 \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nPrevious versions of this article were presented at the annual convention of the Italian \nPolitical Science Association (SISP), Catania, 20-22 September 2007, at the annual \nconvention of the International Studies Association, San Francisco, 26-29 March 2008, \n 27 \nand at the Millennium annual conference, London, 25-26 October 2008.
