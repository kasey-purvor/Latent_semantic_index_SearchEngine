INTRODUCTION\nH ISTORICALLY, the log-normal distribution has beenmainly used to model the effect of shadowing of the\nsignal due to large obstructions [1]. The effect of shadowing on\nthe performance of wireless communication systems has been\nmostly studied jointly with the effect of small scale fading [2],\n[3]. Lately, in 2003, the channel modelling subcommittee of\nthe IEEE 802.15.3a working group for wireless personal area\nnetworks released a reference Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) indoor\nchannel, known as the IEEE 802.15.3a channel model [4],\nbased on numerous contributions and experimental results [5],\n[6]. This channel model, designed for UWB communications\n[7], encompasses the main features of the Saleh-Valenzuela\nchannel model [8], i.e., multipath rays arrive in clusters and\ntheir amplitudes follow double-exponential decay, but the log-\nnormal distribution has been found the best match to represent\nthe amplitude distribution of the channel [5].\nThe average probability of error for different cellular com-\nmunication systems, where shadowing is involved on its own\nor mixed with either Rayleigh or Rician fading, has been de-\nrived in [2]. The resulting expression is a computable formula\nof the average probability of error, obtained by using Hermite\npolynomial approximation [9], that provides only numerical\nresults. Similarly in [3], an exact formula for determining\nthe outage probability of cellular systems over log-normal\nManuscript received December 4, 2006; revised May 14, 2007; accepted\nSeptember 18, 2007.

This approximation is designed\nusing simple interpolation techniques, the Lambert\u2019s function\n[10] and other basic mathematical tools. It is given in terms of\nthe Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) of the system, the mean and\nthe standard deviation of any log-normally distributed Random\nVariable (RV) and the symbol constellation parameters. Our\nexpression that is presented under a closed-form has been\nused in [11] to establish the theoretical performance of single-\nband UWB systems and to derive code design criteria for\nmultiple-antennae single-band UWB systems operating over\nthe IEEE 802.15.3a channel. It can also be useful to evaluate\nthe symbol-error performance of communication systems over\nlog-normal fading channels or to get an intuitive understanding\nof the behaviour of this performance at high SNRs.\nII. SYSTEM MODEL\nIn a mobile radio environment, shadowing is usually mod-\nelled as a multiplicative and slowly time varying random\nprocess. The received signal r(t) can be expressed in presence\nof noise as follows [1]\nr(t) =\n\u221a\n\u0002ss(t)h(t) + n(t), (1)\nwhere \u0002s is the transmitted symbol energy, s(t) is the trans-\nmitted signal, h(t) is the random process that characterizes the\nshadowing effect, and n(t) is an additive zero-mean Gaussian\nnoise with variance N0\/2. At any instant, the shadowing\nis considered as log-normally distributed. Moreover, for a\nslow-varying environment, h(t) can be considered constant\nsuch that h(t) = \u03b2 is a log-normally distributed RV. As far\nas UWB communication systems are concerned, the channel\nmodel released by the IEEE for indoor communications in\n[4], namely the IEEE 802.15.3a channel model, exhibits a\nlog-normal distribution of its multipath attenuation factor. In\nthat case, the received signal r(t) can be expressed as in\n(1) with h(t) = \u2211k Gk\u03b4(t \u2212 \u03c4k), as shown in [12] and\n[13], where Gk is the multipath attenuation factor, \u03c4k is its\ncorresponding time delay, and \u03b4(t) is an impulse signal. Any\nmultipath attenuation factor Gk is such that Gk = \u03b2kej\u03b8k\nwith \u03b2k being a log-normally distributed RV and \u03b8k \u2208 {0, \u03c0}\n[4]. Assuming that s(t) is a signal modulated with one of\nthe following common constellations; a binary antipodal, a\n1536-1276\/08$25.00 c\u00a9 2008 IEEE\n1496 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS, VOL. 7, NO. 5, MAY 2008\nbinary orthogonal, an M -ary Pulse Amplitude Modulation\n(PAM), an M -ary Phase Shift Keying (PSK) modulation, or a\nrectangular M -ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM);\nthen the symbol-error probability obtained by using maximum\nlikelihood detection for these constellations is given by [1]\nPe = q(\u03b1) = \u03b61Q\n(\u221a\n\u03b60\u03b3s\u03b1\n)\n, (2)\nwhere Q(x) = 1\u221a\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\u221e\nx\ne\u2212t\n2\/2dt, \u03b60 and \u03b61 are coefficients\nrelated to the constellation shape [14], \u03b3s = \u0002s\/N0 is the\nSNR per symbol, and \u03b1 is a RV. In the shadowing case\n\u03b1 = \u03b22 and in the UWB case, as shown in [12] and [13],\n\u03b1 \u2248 \u2211k \u03b22k . Moreover, since \u03b2 is log-normally distributed,\n\u03b22 is log-normally distributed as well, and then using the\nresults in [15] \u2211k \u03b22k can be considered as a log-normally\ndistributed RV [13]. Therefore, in both cases \u03b1 is a log-\nnormally distributed RV. Averaging (2) over \u03b1, we obtain an\nexpression for the Average Symbol-Error Probability (ASEP)\nas\nPe =\n\u222b +\u221e\n0\np(\u03b1)q(\u03b1)d\u03b1, (3)\nwhere p(\u03b1) is the pdf of a (m\u03b1, \u03c3\u03b1)-log-normally-distributed\nRV \u03b1 given by\np(\u03b1) =\n1\n\u03b1\n\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c3\u03b1\nexp\n(\n\u22121\n2\n(\nln (\u03b1)\u2212m\u03b1\n\u03c3\u03b1\n)2)\n, (4)\nwith ma and \u03c3a being the mean and standard deviation of\nthe log-normally distributed RV \u03b1, respectively. Usually in\nwireless communications, parameters (my, \u03c3y) are introduced\nto characterize a log-normal distribution, where my = Cm\u03b1,\n\u03c3y = C\u03c3\u03b1 and C = 10\/ ln (10) [15]. The parameter \u03c3y ,\nknown as the dB spread, is usually between 6 and 12 dB\nfor most of the wireless communication systems [15], and\nbetween 2 and 5 dB for the UWB systems [4]. The function\nQ(x) can be tightly-approximated or closely-upper bounded\nby other simple and integrable functions as it has been shown\nin [2] and [16]. For instance, in [16], Q(x) is said to be upper\nbounded by\nI\u2211\ni=1\ncie\n\u2212 bi2 x2 , (5)\nwhere ci = ai\/2, ai > 0 and bi \u2265 1 are defined in [16]. The\nexpression in (5) tends to be equal to Q(x) as I increases.\nMoreover, for I = 1, c1 = b1 = 1, Q(x) \u2264 e\u2212x2\/2 is the\nChernoff bound on Q(x). Therefore, using (5) in (2), then (2)\nand (4) in (3), the ASEP can be re-expressed as\nPe \u0007\nI\u2211\ni=1\n\u222b +\u221e\n0\n\u03b61ci\n\u03b1\n\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c3\u03b1\n\u00d7\nexp\n(\n\u22121\n2\n(\n\u03b60bi\u03b3s\u03b1 +\n(\nln (\u03b1)\u2212m\u03b1\n\u03c3\u03b1\n)2))\nd\u03b1,\n(6)\nfor a large value of I . Then, using the change of variables\nx =\n(\nln (\u03b1)\u2212m\u03b1\u221a\n2\u03c3\u03b1\n)\nin (6), Pe can be rewritten in a compact\nform as\nPe\u0007\nI\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b61ci\u221a\n\u03c0\n\u222b +\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ne\u2212\u03bdie\nx\nk e\u2212x\n2\ndx =\nI\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b61ci\u221a\n\u03c0\n\u222b +\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nf(x)dx,\n(7)\nwhere \u03bdi = \u03b60bi2 \u03b3se\nm\u03b1 \u2265 0, k = 1\u221a\n2\u03c3\u03b1\n\u2265 0, and f(x) is\nexpressed as follows\nf(x) = e\u2212\u03bdie\n\u2212 x\nk e\u2212x\n2\n, x \u2208 R. (8)\nIII. A TIGHT APPROXIMATION OF THE INTEGRAL OF f(x)\nIn this section, knowing that f(x) does not have a closed-\nform integral, we use linear interpolation to design an ana-\nlytically integrable function g(x), which tightly approximates\nf(x) over its domain.\nThe function f(x) in (8) is always a positive and a differ-\nentiable function of x and lim\nx\u2192\u2212\u221e f(x) = limx\u2192+\u221e f(x) = 0.\nDifferentiating f(x) with respect to x, we obtain\ndf(x)\ndx\n= e\u2212\n\u0000\n\u03bdie\n\u2212 x\nk + xk +x\n2\n\u0002 [\u03bdi\nk\n\u2212 2xe xk\n]\n. (9)\nThe first term of this expression is clearly always positive. Let\nx\u0302f be a solution of the equation df(x)dx = 0. Then,\ndf(x)\ndx \u2265 0\nover (\u2212\u221e, x\u0302f], and df(x)dx \u2264 0 over [x\u0302f,+\u221e). This implies that\nf(x) increases over (\u2212\u221e, x\u0302f] and decreases over [x\u0302f,+\u221e).\nTherefore, f(x) has a unique maximum, which occurs at x =\nx\u0302f, that can be obtained as follows\ndf(x = x\u0302f)\ndx\n= 0\u21d2 \u03bdi\n2k2\n=\nx\u0302f\nk\ne\n\u0000xf\nk . (10)\nThe Lambert W function is the inverse function of f(w) =\nwew where ew is the natural exponential function and w is any\ncomplex number and thus, the Lambert W function satisfies\nW (z)eW (z) = z, z \u2208 C [10]. Moreover, the real branch of the\nLambert function denoted W0 is such that W0 : R+ \u2192 R+.\nThen, in (10), we set W0(z) = \u0003xfk , z = \u03bdi2k2 and obtain [17]\nx\u0302f = kW0\n( \u03bdi\n2k2\n)\n. (11)\nSince \u03bdi \u2208 R+, k \u2208 R+, and W0 : R+ \u2192 R+, therefore\nx\u0302f \u2208 R+.\nFor any interval [xn, xn+1], xn, xn+1 \u2208 R, there exists,\nan \u2265 0, bn \u2264 0 verifying the inequality\nx2 \u2265 an|x|+ bn, (12)\nand chosen such that x2 = an|x| + bn for x = xn+1+xn2 .\nInserting the result (12) in (8) and defining the interval\n[xn, xn+1] to be narrow, i.e., (xn+1 \u2212 xn) \u000b 1, we obtain a\nvery tight upper-bound of f(x) over each interval, as follows\ngn(x) = e\u2212\u03bdie\n\u2212 x\nk e\u2212(an|x|+bn). (13)\nThen, g(x) is defined using gn(x) as\ng(x) =\nLN\u2211\nn=\u2212LN\ngn(x), (14)\nsuch that for any interval [xn, xn+1], gn\u22121(xn) = gn(xn) in\norder to ensure that g(x) is a continuous function over its\ndomain. Therefore, if [xn, xn+1] is narrow enough, then g(x)\ntightly upper-bounds f(x), and thus as f(x), is a positive\nfunction of x with a unique maximum. Let us denote the\nmaximum of g(x), x\u0302g, and assume that this maximum occurs\nfor a x belonging to one of the 2LN intervals [xn, xn+1]\ncomposing the domain of g(x). For instance, let the interval\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS, VOL. 7, NO. 5, MAY 2008 1497\n[x0, x1] contains x\u0302g, then using the first derivative of g0(x)\ndefined as\ndg0(x)\ndx\n= e\u2212\n\u0000\n\u03bdie\n\u2212 x\nk + xk +a0|x|+b0\n\u0002\n[\n\u03bdi\nk\n\u2212 a0x|x| e\nx\nk\n]\n= 0, (15)\nwe can solve dg0(x= \u0003xg)dx = 0 and obtain the value of x\u0302g. For\nx\u0302g < 0, |x\u0302g| = \u2212x\u0302g and it implies with (15) that \u03bdik = \u2212a0e\n\u0000xg\nk\n.\nThis equation has no solution in R since \u03bdi, k, a0 and e\n\u0000xg\nk are\nall positive numbers, thus x\u0302g is positive. Then, using (15) x\u0302g\ncan be expressed as\nx\u0302g = k ln (\u03bdi\/ka0) . (16)\nAt this point using relation (12), we propose rules to design the\nintervals [xn, xn+1] and the parameters an and bn. Knowing\nthat both functions f(x) and g(x) are positive with a single\npositive maximum, we set both maxima to occur at the same\nabscissa value such that x\u0302f = x\u0302g. Consequently, using the def-\ninition of x\u0302f and x\u0302g given in (11) and (16), respectively, it im-\nplies kW0(\u03bdi\/2k2) = k ln (\u03bdi\/ka0) \u21d4 exp (W0(\u03bdi\/2k2)) =\n\u03bdi\/ka0 \u21d4 (a0\/2k) exp (W0(\u03bdi\/2k2)) = \u03bdi\/2k2 \u2265 0,\nequivalently with the definition of the Lambert function\n(a0\/2k) exp (W0(\u03bdi\/2k2)) = W0(\u03bdi\/2k2) exp (W0(\u03bdi\/2k2))\nand finally gives\na0 = 2kW0\n( \u03bdi\n2k2\n)\n= 2x\u0302f. (17)\nMoreover, we set both maxima to occur at the same ordinate\nvalue such that f(x) = g0(x) for x = x\u0302f = x\u0302g. Consequently,\nusing the definition of f(x) in (8) and gn(x) in (13) with n =\n0, for x = x\u0302f, it comes exp (\u2212x\u0302f2) = exp (\u2212(a0|x\u0302f|+ b0))\u21d4\nx\u0302f\n2 = a0|x\u0302f| + b0 \u21d4 x\u0302f2 = 2x\u0302f2 + b0, and thus implies\nb0 = \u2212x\u0302f2. Finally, over the interval [x0, x1], x0 and x1\nmust satisfy simultaneously the inequality in (12), the equality\nx2 = a0|x| + b0 for x = x1+x02 and (x1 \u2212 x0) \u000b 1. Thus,\nwe propose x1 = x\u0302f\n(\n1 + 12N\n)\n, x0 = x\u0302f\n(\n1\u2212 12N\n)\n, and the\nlength of [x0, x1] to be equal to x\u0302f\/N , with N \r 1.

NUMERICAL ANALYSIS AND INTUITIVE\nSIMPLIFICATION METHOD FOR P\u02dce\nIn Fig. 2, we plot Pe and P\u02dce against \u03b3s (dB), and compare\nthem considering a binary antipodal constellation, i.e., (\u03b60 =\n2, \u03b61 = 1), a dB spread \u03c3y = 6 dB, my = 0 dB, various\nvalues of I and different values of LN . As expected, the\nresults first show that the larger I , N , L are, the better the\napproximation is. The results also indicate that if I decreases\nthen the approximation becomes looser, nevertheless P\u02dce keeps\na nearly parallel feature with the curve of Pe for large SNR\nper symbol values. This parallel feature is observed for any\nvalue of I . For I = 1, c1 = 1\/2 and b1 = 1, [16], (26) can\nbe re-expressed as\nP\u02dce =\n\u03b61\n2\n\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c3\u03b1\nLN\u2211\nn=\u2212LN\nG(u,N, n)e\u2212u(ln(u)+\u03c3\n2\n\u03b1u\/2), (27)\nwhere u = W0( \u03b602 \u03b3be\nm\u03b1\u03c32\u03b1)\/\u03c3\n2\n\u03b1. Moreover, for a fixed I\nvalue, the values of LN affect the curvature of P\u02dce at low\nSNRs. Notice that the same results are obtained for other\nconstellations, different values of \u03c3y and my . Following these\nobservations, it becomes clear that at low SNRs, the slope\nof P\u02dce is predominantly determined by the multiplicative term\nG(u,N, n) in (27), and that at high SNRs, i.e., u \r 1, the\nslope of P\u02dce is predominantly determined by the exponential\nterm in (27). Using this intuition, we modify P\u02dce in (26), which\nis not convenient to use and is not actually a proper closed-\nform expression, and introduce a new function P \u2032e based on\n(27) to closely approximate Pe as follows\nPe \u0007 P \u2032e =\n\u03b61\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c3\u03b1\n\u03c6 (u) e\u2212u(ln(u)+\u03c3\n2\n\u03b1u\/2), (28)\nwhere\n\u03c6 (u) = \u03b70eu ln(u)\u2212\u03b71u\n\u03b72 (29)\nhas been found to be an excellent choice of a parametric\nfunction, with \u03b70, \u03b71, \u03b72 \u2208 R. Notice that, contrary to P\u02dce in\n(26), P \u2032e is a closed-form expression given in terms of the\nLambert, logarithmic and exponential functions.\nV. A HIGHLY ACCURATE CLOSED-FORM APPROXIMATION\nOF THE ASEP\nThe tightness of our closed-form approximation of the\nASEP proposed in (28) can be adjusted using the parameters\n\u03b70, \u03b71 and \u03b72. Our method to find the best approximation of\nPe by P \u2032e between any two probability of errors Pa and Pb\nrelies on the following criterion\n1\nN\nN\u22121\u2211\nn=0\n\u2223\u2223\u2223Pe\u22121 (10\u0394n(n+ 12 )Pa, \u03c3y)\n\u2212P \u2032e\n\u22121 (\n10\u0394n(n+\n1\n2 )Pa, \u03c3y, \u03b70, \u03b71, \u03b72\n)\u2223\u2223\u2223 < \u03b50.

In\nFigures 3, 4 and 5, we plot Pe in (3) and P \u2032e in (31) vs. \u03b3s\n(dB) for various dB spread values and for different types and\nsizes of constellations. These graphs show a highly tight fitness\nbetween Pe and P \u2032e for any dB spread values and constellations\npresented and, hence, indicate graphically the accuracy of our\nproposed closed-form approximation in (31). Furthermore, the\naccuracy of P \u2032e can be improved for lower \u03b50 values by a\nproper choice of the parameters \u03b70, \u03b71 and \u03b72 in our design\nformula (30).\nVI.

Another application of this expression can be found in\n[11], where it has been applied to establish the theoretical\nperformance of single-link and multiple-antennae single-band\nUWB systems operating over the IEEE 802.15.3a channel for\nvarious modulation schemes, detection methods and types of\nenvironments.

Thus,\nan upper-bound of P \u2032e can be obtained at high SNRs as\nP \u2032e\u2264\nC\u03b61\u03b70\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c3y\n[\ne(\u03b3s(dB)+\u03bc)\n2\n]\u2212 1\n2(1+d)2\u03c32y =C0\n[\ne(\u03b3s(dB)+\u03bc)\n2\n]\u2212C1\n,\n(32)\nwhere \u03bc = C ln\n(\n\u03b60e\nm\u03b1\u03c32y\/2C\n2\n)\nand C0 and C1 are positive\nconstants. In comparison, assuming a transmission of data over\na Rayleigh or a Rician fading channel, the ASEP at high SNRs\ncan be formulated as follows\nPe \u2264 D0\n[\ne(\u03b3s(dB))\n]\u2212D1\n, (33)\nwhere D0 and D1 are positive constants. Both of these bounds\nin (32) and (33) are loose bounds that describe the asymptotic\nbehaviour of the ASEP at high SNRs. It is well-known that\nover a Rayleigh fading channel, the ASEP at high SNRs is a\nlinear function of the SNR(dB) considering a semi-log scale\n[1], as it is clearly proven by (33). Similarly, (32) shows that\nthe ASEP at high SNRs over a log-normal fading channel is\na quadratic function of the SNR(dB) considering a semi-log\nscale.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nAn accurate closed-form approximation of the ASEP over a\nlog-normal fading channel has been derived for any practical\ndB spread values and various constellation sizes and types.\nFirst, using the approximation of Q(x) in [16] and a simple\nlinear approximation for f(x), we have obtained an expression\nP\u02dce that closely approximates Pe for large values of I , L,\nand N . However, we have noticed that even for small values\nof these parameters, the slopes of Pe and P\u02dce presented\nparallel features at high SNRs. Then, using this intuition, we\nhave modified the simplest P\u02dce expression by introducing a\nparametric function and a criterion with an adjustable accuracy\nto obtain our accurate approximation, i.e., P \u2032e, for Pe. The\ngreat accuracy of P \u2032e has been obtained for a typical range\nof average error probability in mobile communications by\noptimizing the values \u03b70, \u03b71 and \u03b72 in our design formula, and\nhas been shown experimentally for practical dB spread values\nand various constellation sizes and types. Some applications\nof our closed-form approximation have also been presented,\nfor instance to establish the theoretical performance of single-\nband UWB systems or to evaluate and compare quickly the\nsymbol-error performance of communication systems over\nlog-normal fading channels. Finally, an upper bound of P \u2032e\nhas been found that provides an intuitive understanding of the\nbehaviour of Pe at high SNRs.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J. Proakis, Digital Communications, 4th ed.
