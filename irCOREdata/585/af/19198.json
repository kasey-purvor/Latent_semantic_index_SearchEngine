The characteristics of FT-ICR ECD data are sub-10\nppm mass accuracy, low noise levels, intense precursor and\ncharge-reduced precursor peaks, and strong neutral loss peaks\nfrom the charge-reduced precursor.6,7 Furthermore, hydrogen\ntransfer can occur between ECD c-prime and z-dot fragments,\nresulting in c-dot and z-prime products.8\nThe search engines that have been employed for large-scale\nECD data analysis are Mascot and OMSSA.4,5 These search\nengines have certain limitations, for example, the product ion\ntolerance cannot be specified in ppm and the benefits of high\nmass accuracy data are not fully realized. We have analyzed\nlarge-scale ECD data sets both manually and using various\nsearch engines. It is apparent from these analyses that certain\ngeneric aspects of ECDmass spectra are likely to be detrimental\nto their identification by database search engines. The most\nobvious of these is the high intensity precursor and charge-\nreduced precursor peaks. Both search engines tested here\nalready anticipate these peaks, removing them from consid-\neration. For example, Mascot removes peaks within the frag-\nment ion tolerance window about each of the precursor isotope\npeaks. However, the search engines do not consider coeluting\npeaks in the precursor isolation window and are, in fact,\nignorant of the isolation window size. Another characteristic\nof ECD is the generation of various neutral losses from the\ncharge-reduced precursors. These peaks are not utilized by\ncurrently available search engines.

Previous\nobservations in our laboratory reveal that ECD mass spectra\nfrom doubly charged precursors typically give lower scores and\nidentification rates than more highly charged precursors. In\npart this is likely due to the fragmentation process itself:\nelectron capture efficiency increases as the square of the ion\ncharge hence doubly charged precursors are less likely to\ncapture an electron. In addition, only one of the resulting\nfragments can retain the single positive charge. We test whether\nthe identification rate for ECD mass spectra from doubly\ncharged precursors can be increased through removal of some\nof the aforementioned uninformative peak types. Recently,\nGood et al.9 developed a similar presearch processing algorithm\nfor electron transfer dissociation (ETD) data. The algorithm was\ntested on a low resolution ETD data set. The Good algorithm\ndiffers from that described here: (1) rather than remove the\nentire neutral loss region from the mass spectrum, our algo-\nrithm retains all potential true peaks; (2) our algorithm does\nnot remove neutral loss regions from higher (>2+) charge-state\nprecursor ions; (3) our algorithm allows removal of noise peaks.\nWe compare our algorithm with the Good algorithm for high\nresolution ECD data.\nMethods\nCell Culture and Sample Preparation. Mouse fibroblast NIH\n3T3 cells were cultured and lysed as previously described.5\nProteins were reduced and alkylated (DTT and iodoacetamide),\ndigested using trypsin and the resulting peptides separated by\nSCX chromatography, again as described previously.5\nLiquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-\nMS\/MS). Online liquid chromatography was performed by use\nof a Micro AS autosampler and Surveyor MS pump (Thermo\nFisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Peptides were loaded onto\na 75 \u00b5m (internal diameter) Integrafrit (New Objective) C8\nresolving column (length 10 cm) and separated over a 40 min\ngradient from 0% to 40% acetonitrile (Baker, Holland). Peptides\neluted directly (\u223c350 nL\/min) via a Triversa nanospray source\n(Advion Biosciences, NY) into a 7 T LTQ FT mass spectrometer\n(Thermo Fisher Scientific), where they were subjected to data-\ndependent CID and ECD.\nData-Dependent CID and ECD (DD-CID-ECD). The mass\nspectrometer alternated between a full FT-MS scan (m\/z\n400-1600) and subsequent CID and ECD MS\/MS scans of the\nmost abundant ion above a threshold of 40 000. Survey scans\nwere acquired in the ICR cell with a resolution of 100 000 at\nm\/z 400. Precursor ions were subjected to CID in the linear\nion trap. The width of the precursor isolation window was 6\nm\/z. Only multiply charged precursor ions were selected for\nMS\/MS. CID was performed with helium gas at a normalized\ncollision energy of 35%. Automated gain control was used to\naccumulate sufficient precursor ions (target value 5 \u00d7 104,\nmaximum fill time 0.2 s). For the ECD event, precursor ions\nwere isolated in the ion trap and transferred to the ICR cell.\nIsolation width was 6 m\/z. Automated gain control was used\nto accumulate sufficient precursor ions (target value 1 \u00d7 106\nper microscan, maximum fill time 1 s). The electrons for ECD\nwere produced by an indirectly heated barium tungsten\ncylindrical dispenser cathode (5.1 mm diameter, 154 mm from\nthe cell, 1 mm off-axis). The current across the electrode was\n\u223c1.1 A. Ions were irradiated for 60 ms at 5% energy (corre-\nsponding to a cathode potential of -2.775 V). Each ECD scan\ncomprised 4 coadded microscans, acquired with a resolution\nof 25 000 atm\/z 400. Dynamic exclusion was used with a repeat\ncount of 1 and an exclusion duration of 60 s. Data acquisition\nwas controlled by Xcalibur 2.0 and Tune 2.2 software (Thermo\nFisher Scientific, Inc.).\nData Analysis. DTA files were created from the raw data\nusing Bioworks 3.3.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The DTA\nfiles were either searched directly, or preprocessed using a perl\nscript to remove non-c,z,y peaks as described in the text. The\nperl script is available as a Supplementary File online. The\nregions removed from all ECD mass spectra consisted of (1) a\nprominent noise peak (m\/z 101.7-102.1) and (2) the isolation\nwindow around the precursor ion (precursor( 3m\/z). For ECD\nmass spectra of [M + 2H]2+ ions, the region containing neutral\nloss peaks from the charge-reduced precursor was modified\nas follows: in the region [M + 2H]+ > m\/z > ([M + 2H]+ - 57),\nno peaks were retained. (No c,z,y peaks can fall in this region\nas the smallest amino acid residue, glycine, has a mass of 57\nDa.) Within the region ([M + 2H]+ - 57) > m\/z > ([M + 2H]+\n- 140), the peaks that could correspond to c ions, z prime ions,\nz dot ions, and y ions were retained. The list of masses retained,\nannotated with their corresponding fragment, is given in\nSupporting Information Table 1. The window around each\nretained m\/z was set at (12 ppm.\nFor comparison, DTA files were also generated using the DTA\nGenerator developed for postacquisition ETD processing by\nGood, et al.9 These DTA files were either left unprocessed (1),\nprocessed with the Good ETD algorithm (2) or processed as\nabove with our algorithm (3). Options: Fragment ion intensity,\n0.7% (relative). Assumed precursor charge state range: 2-8.\nETD Cleaning algorithm: none (1 and 3). Output: individual\nDTAs. Or for (2) ETD Cleaning algorithm: smart. Clean precur-\nsor, charge-reduced precursor, clean NL from charge-reduced\nprecursor.\nSearches were carried out against a concatenated database\nconsisting of the mouse IPI database (Version 3.40) supple-\nmented with common contaminants (including keratins, trypsin,\nBSA) and the reversed-sequence version of the same database.\nThe final database contained 107 688 protein entries (53 844\nof which were reversed-sequence versions). CID and ECD data\nwere searched separately.\nMascot (version 2.2.; Matrix Science, U.K.) was searched\nusing the following parameters for ECD data: enzyme, trypsin;\nmaximum missed cleavages, 2; fixed modification, carbami-\ndomethyl (C); variable modifications, acetyl (protein N-termi-\nnus), Oxidation (M); Peptide tolerance, 1.1 Da (or as stated in\nthe text); MS\/MS tolerance, 0.02 Da; Instrument, FTMS-ECD\n(2+ fragments if precursor 3+ or higher; ion types, c, y, z + 1,\nz+ 2 [corresponds to z-dot and z-prime]). Settings for CID data\nwere as above, except MS\/MS tolerance, 0.5 Da; Instrument,\nESI-TRAP (2+ fragments if precursor 2+ or higher; ion types,\nb, b with NH3 loss if b significant and fragment contains RKNQ,\nb with water loss if b significant and fragment contains STED,\ny, y with NH3 and water losses (as for b)).\nMascot search results were exported (\u201cFormat as: export\nsearch results\u201d) using the following settings: export format, CSV;\nsignificance threshold <1; Max. number of hits, 16 000. All other\nsettings were left as default. The number of proteins exported\nwas checked, to ensure it did not reach the number specified\nin \u201cMax. number of hits\u201d, above. This indicates that all\nidentifications, however low-scoring, were exported. A perl\nscript was used to copy the protein identifier into every peptide\nidentification row for each protein identified.\nresearch articles Sweet et al.\n5476 Journal of Proteome Research \u2022 Vol. 8, No. 12, 2009\nExported Mascot results were sorted (in Excel) by descending\nscore, and then by protein accession (A to Z, in this case, to\nensure ###REV... is listed before IPI:...). This was to ensure that,\nfor a reverse and a forward hit of identical score, the reverse\nhit was preferentially retained. Lower scoring identifications\nwere removed, leaving only the top scoring identification for\neach MS\/MS event (remove duplicates for Peptide Scan Title\ncolumn). The mass error in ppm was calculated for each\nidentification (using the charge-state, theoretical mass and\ndelta mass: delta mass\/(theor. mass + chargestate \u00d7 1.00728)\n\u00d7 1 000 000).\nThe OMSSA Browser 2.1.1 was employed to search the DTA\nfiles. OMSSA settings were as previously described, with the\nexception that phosphorylation was not considered as a\nvariable modification.5 For the ECD search, the \u2018elimination\nof charge-reduced precursors in spectrum\u2019 option was selected.\nResearching ECD Phosphopeptide Data Set. A total of 6080\nECD DTAs were processed as above, that is, removal of noise\npeak, precursor window and neutral loss peaks. Database\nsearching was as for unmodified (above), but allowing STY\nphosphorylation as a variable modification. Postsearch filtering\nwas as above.\nResults\nTo test the effect of various search-related parameters, we\nemployed a test data set consisting of 3341 high quality ECD\nmass spectra obtained from the LC-MS\/MS analysis of mouse\nwhole cell lysate. Paired ion trap CID and FT-ICR ECD mass\nspectra were acquired, as previously described.4,5 The mouse\nIPI database was searched; a concatenated forward-reverse\nversion of this database was employed, unless stated otherwise.\nIn all cases, the false-discovery rate (FDR) as estimated by the\nnumber of accepted reverse identifications was controlled at\nless than 1%. Full details of the peptide identifications are\nsupplied as Supplementary Data.\nInitial Search. An initial search, without preprocessing of\nthe CID or ECD data, was carried out using both search\nengines: Mascot and OMSSA. The precursor mass tolerance was\nset to 0.02 m\/z (OMSSA) or 10 ppm (Mascot).\nFor the initial Mascot search, a forward-only version of the\nmouse IPI database was employed, in combination with the\nMascot \u2018decoy\u2019 option. The \u2018decoy\u2019 option automatically carries\nout a second search using a randomized database, and thereby\ngives an estimate of FDR. However, adjusting the FDR to a\nparticular value (1%) was not possible. The search resulted in\n633 ECD identifications and 1712 CID identifications. To better\ncontrol the estimated FDR, we repeated the Mascot search,\nwithout \u201cdecoy\u201d option, using the concatenated version of the\ndatabase (as used in all subsequent searches), exported all\nresults into Excel, and manually filtered according to Mascot\nscore. That resulted in a doubling of the number of accepted\nidentifications, as shown in Table 1 (ECD Search: row 1 versus\nrow 3). Manually filtered Mascot and OMSSA searches give\nsimilar numbers of identifications for both ECD and CID data\nsets. The identification rates reach 38% for ECD data (1254\nidentifications) and 69% for CID data (2297 identifications).\nClearly, there is a considerable difference, of approximately\n30%, in identification success rate between CID and ECDmass\nspectra.\nPostsearch Filtering by Precursor Mass Error. Database\nsearches employing a wide precursor mass tolerance window,\nwith subsequent filtering of results, have previously been shown\nto improve identification rates.5,10 While the benefits of post-\nsearch filtering are well-established, we were interested in\ncomparing the magnitude of its effect with the other levels of\ndata processing described here and the effectiveness for ECD\ncompared to CID data. We therefore repeated the above\nsearches with a precursor mass tolerance of 1.1 Da and\nexported all results for subsequent manual filtering of identi-\nfications by precursor error (in ppm) and, if the selected ppm\nrange contains more reverse hits than compatible with a 1%\nFDR, by peptide score. This resulted in an increased number\nof accepted identifications for all searches (Table 2). We note\nthat the increase in identification efficiency for ECD data is\ngreater than that for CID data, for example, increases of 6.4%\nand 3.1%, for ECD and CID searches using Mascot. This\ncharacteristic may be the result of the lower peptide scores for\nECD identifications (Mascot average score of 23 versus 40, for\nECD (n ) 1468) and CID (n ) 2385), respectively), that is, the\ntrue identifications are less readily distinguished from reverse\nhits on the basis of peptide score alone.\nPrevious work has shown that it is possible for the precursor\nmass recorded in the DTA file to correspond to the second or\nthird isotopic peak (i.e., one or two 13C more than the\nmonoisotopic peak).11 This occurrence is particularly common\nfor low resolution ion-trap only experiments. If this occurs,\nidentifications can be rescued by searching with a larger\nprecursor tolerance window (with subsequent narrow mass\nfiltering around the offset precursor mass). We compared\nsearches with 1.1, 2.1, and 3.1 Da tolerances. In none of the\ncases was there a high-scoring identification resulting from\nTable 1.

Precursor mass tolerances\nof 2.1 and 3.1 Da do not increase the number of identifications,\nindicating that the Bioworks-generated DTA contains the\ncorrect monoisotopic mass. When the second or third isotopic\npeak was selected for fragmentation, the mass in the DTA file\ngenerated by Bioworks was automatically corrected to the\nmonoisotopic value. (As a result of the high precursor threshold\nfor fragmentation, the true monoisotopic ion was always clearly\ndetected.)\nPreprocessing of ECD Spectra. Electrical Noise Peak. The\nresults of the initial searches, as reported in Tables 1 and 2,\nindicate an identification success rate of approximately 70%\nfor CID mass spectra and 45% for ECD mass spectra. We\nexamined the ECD spectra for generic features which may be\ndetrimental to the identification success rate. Electrical noise\npeaks are unfortunate but commonplace features of mass\nspectra. In all FT-ICR data from our instrument, we observe a\npeak of this kind at m\/z 102. No equivalent peaks are observed\nin the LTQ linear ion trap mass spectra. The peak is broad and\nlacks isotope peaks, easily distinguishing it from true analyte\npeaks (Figure 1). Removing the region in which this peak occurs\n(101.7-102.1 m\/z) from the DTA files is a straightforward way\nto improve the ratio of informative to uninformative peaks for\nthe database search. This increases the Mascot and OMSSA\nidentification scores and therefore number of identifications\n(Tables 3 and 4, row 2). The noise peak removal could in theory\nalso remove a z-dot ion from C-terminal valine; however, this\nwill have no effect in practice, since a vast majority of tryptic\npeptides have lysine or arginine at their C-terminus. (The noise\npeak would also obscure the valine z-dot ion.)\nCoeluting Peaks of Similar m\/z (within the Precursor\nIsolation Window). To maximize the transfer of large numbers\nof precursor ions from the linear ion trap into the ICR cell for\nECD fragmentation, a precursor isolation window larger than\nthat selected for LTQ CID is usually employed.12 This window\ntypically ranges from 3 to 10 m\/z.5,13 Here, we use an isolation\nwidth of 6m\/z. During analysis of complex proteomic samples,\ncoelution of peptides of similar m\/z is frequently observed.11\nIn contrast to the LTQ CID process, peaks in the isolation\nwindow are not fragmented to completion during ECDmaking\nany coelution of peptides more readily apparent. Both OMSSA\nand Mascot have options to remove the intact precursor peak\n(these options are employed in all the searches described here);\nhowever, this only removes the precursor and its isotopes\naccording to the user-defined fragment ion mass tolerance, and\nnot any coeluting peptide or noise peaks within the precursor\nisolation window. We investigated whether removing the\ncomplete isolation window from the DTA files prior to database\nsearching would improve the resulting identifications (Tables\n3 and 4). An example of an additional identification resulting\nfrom the removal of the isolation window is shown in Figure\n2. It should be noted that bona fide fragment peaks may\ninadvertently be removed during this trimming process. We\nremove the 6 m\/z region around the precursor. For a typical\n1500 Da, 2+ tryptic peptide, the acquired MS\/MS ECD mass\nspectrum ranges from 100 to 1500 m\/z. Therefore, we remove\nFigure 1. Noise peak at m\/z \u223c102.

The fraction of useful fragment peaks\nremoved is expected to be less than 0.04%, as fragment peaks\ncoinciding with the precursor will, in any case, not be distin-\nguishable from the high intensity precursor. The increase in\nidentifications shown in Tables 3 and 4 indicates that the net\neffect is positive. By plotting every identification score, with\nand without removal of the precursor isolation window, we see\nthat a vast majority of identifications result in an increased\nscore (Figure 3). (In a small number of cases, a previously\naccepted identification was replaced with an unacceptable\nidentification (reverse hit or unacceptable mass error), due to\nthe score of the unacceptable identification increasing by more\nthan the score of the previously accepted identification. These\ncases are plotted as a score of zero.)\nTo control for any unanticipated effects of this trimming\nprocess, a window of the same size (6 m\/z), but shifted away\nfrom the precursor isolation region (+25 m\/z) was removed.\nThis had no net effect on the number of ECD identifications\n(data not shown). Removing the precursor isolation window\nfrom CID DTAs also has no net effect, positive or negative (data\nnot shown). This observation agrees with the lack of high\nintensity intact precursor surviving in this region during the\nion-trap excitation event, leaving no intense peaks to potentially\nconfound the database search.\nNeutral Losses from Charge-Reduced Precursor. A salient\nfeature of ECD is the potential for neutral losses from the\ncharge-reduced precursor.6,7 These losses are particularly\nevident in ECDmass spectra of doubly charged precursors. The\ntryptic peptides are predominantly doubly charged: 67% of the\nECD mass spectra collected were from doubly charged precur-\nsors. However, the success rate for the ECD identification of\ndoubly charged precursors was lower than that for triply\ncharged species (32% versus 54%, for the Mascot unaltered\nsearch). Figure 4 shows the proportion of identifications by\ncharge-state for both CID (4b) and ECD (4c), alongside the DTA\ninput proportion (4a). The observed lower success rate for ECD\nidentifications from 2+ precursors agrees with the previously\nreported data for ETD of 2+ and 3+ precursors.14 We hypoth-\nesized that neutral loss peaks from the charge-reduced precur-\nsor which are not anticipated by the database search engine\nmight be detrimental to the identification of doubly charged\npeptides. Rather than remove specific neutral losses from the\n2+ DTAs, we chose to retain all potential true fragment ions\nwithin 140 m\/z of the charge-reduced precursor, specifically\nall possible c, z, z-prime and y ions from tryptic peptides were\nlisted for retention. (The m\/z values of potential true fragment\nions were calculated on the basis of the following known\nparameters: m\/z of the charge-reduced precursor, mass of\namino acid residues, and structures of c, z, z-prime and y ions.)\nThat resulted in a net increase in 2+ identification efficiency\nof 3.5% and 1.5% for Mascot and OMSSA, respectively. The\ncumulative effect of the three precursor trimming operations\non the number of 2+ identifications is an increase of 16% for\nMascot (from 870 to 1006) and 11% for OMSSA (733 to 813).\nFigure 5 plots the Mascot scores of all 1006 2+ identifications\nafter removing the neutral loss peaks, alongside the scores prior\nto the additional processing. For 98.5% of the previously\nidentified 2+ peptides, the same peptide was identified. In the\nremaining 15 cases, the previously accepted identification was\nrelegated to second place, behind either a decoy hit or a hit\nwith an unacceptably large mass error (presumed false-\npositive). In some cases, it was not clear why the Mascot score\nof the previously accepted hit failed to increase as much as\nthe alternative identification. This is likely related to the overall\nnumber of peaks present and the windows into which Mascot\ndivides the spectrum (D. Creasy, personal communication).\nLarge fragment ions from nontryptic peptides (e.g., C-terminal\npeptides) could potentially be lost; however, in none of these\n15 cases did we observe the loss of a real fragment ion from\nthe Mascot identification.\nWe compared the strategy described above (retaining all true\nfragment ions) with the simpler approach of removing the\nentire 140 m\/z region below the [M + 2H]\u2022 peak, followed by\na Mascot search and postsearch filtering as before. The\nidentification rate was reduced, with 7% fewer identifications\nfrom doubly charged precursors (936 vs 1006). The removal of\nany of the 33 true c\/z\/y fragment ions which fall in this region\nwill be detrimental to identification.\nValidation of Identifications. A large number of the accepted\nECD identifications have low Mascot peptide scores. On the\nbasis of the Mascot scores alone, these identifications would\nusually be rejected; however, the FDR estimate suggests that\nthe majority are correct. We employ two strategies in order to\nvalidate the ECD identifications: (1) check for agreement\nbetween identifications from paired CID and ECD events; (2)\nmanually assess a small number of low-scoring ECD identifica-\ntions, where no paired CID identification was made.\nOf the 1643 ECD identifications, there are only 83 identifica-\ntions without a paired CID identification, that is, 1560 (95%)\nof the ECD identifications are from paired events which also\nled to a CID identification. This high degree of overlap is due\nto the high CID success rate (>70%), which is in turn attribut-\nable to the fragmentation of high intensity (>40 000 counts)\ntryptic peptides. The estimated FDR of less than 1% predicts\nfewer than 15.6 false-positives in this ECD data set and the\nsame number in the CID data set. The FDR therefore predicts\nfewer than 31.2 identification conflicts (as a false-positive for\neither the ECD or CID identification will result in a conflict).\nIn fact we find 21 conflicts, well within the limit of 31 expected\nfor a 1% FDR (Supplementary Table 2). Of these conflicts, 18\nout of 21 are isobaric peptides, often with similar sequences\n(e.g., VAPDEHPILLTEAPLNPK and VAPEEHPVLLTEAPLNPK).\nTo examine the distribution of conflicts, the 1560 ECD\nidentifications with paired CID identifications were divided\nTable 4.

We compared the\ntwo data processing methods directly, using the same set of\nDTAs (generated by the Good algorithm from raw files). The\nresults are shown in Table 5. The ETD algorithm allows removal\nof the precursor window, neutral losses up to 60 Da from the\ncharge-reduced precursor and the charge-reduced precursor\nions themselves. Both processing options result in an increase\nin identifications compared to the unprocessed DTAs, with the\nECD processing algorithm resulting in the most identifications.\nThese searches resulted in fewer identifications than the\nequivalent searches using DTAs generated by Bioworks. Bio-\nworks automatically corrects the precursor mass to the monoiso-\ntopic value even if the second isotopic peak was selected for\nfragmentation. The DTAs generated using the ETD algorithm\nmay be out by 1 Da if the second isotopic peak was selected\nfor fragmentation. While these identifications are recovered by\nfiltering two windows, one around 0 Da error and the second\naround 1 Da error, the likelihood of a false-positive is now\nincreased.\nApplicability to Phosphoproteomic Data Set. In earlier\nwork, we identified over 900 phosphopeptides from a similar\nmouse whole-cell lysate sample after TiO2-based phosphopep-\ntide enrichment.5 From a total of 6080 ECD DTAs, 1087\nphosphopeptides identifications were made (with redundancy).\nThese identifications were made using the same search (OMSSA)\nand postsearch strategies (filtering by precursor mass error and\nFigure 7.

We reanalyzed this data set, keeping the search and\npostsearch steps the same, but employing presearch processing\nof DTAs, as described above. This increased the number of\nphosphopeptide identifications from 1087 to 1155 (a 6%\nincrease) with no change in the number of reverse identifica-\ntions. This increase was largely due to an increase in the\nnumber of identifications from doubly charged precursor ions:\nfrom 285 to 338 (a 19% increase). Employing Mascot for the\nsearch step resulted in slightly fewer phosphopeptide identifi-\ncations.\nDiscussion\nWe have considered three stages of data processing: pre-\nsearch, search and postsearch.\nPostsearch. We confirm that searching using a wide precur-\nsor mass tolerance window, with subsequent filtering by ppm,\nsubstantially improves the identification rate for ECD data as\nwell as CID data. This improvement is due to the tendency for\nfalse-positive hits to scatter across a wider mass range of the\nsearch space than true hits, which cluster within a window of\napproximately 10 ppm.10 We show that postsearch filtering has\na greater effect on ECD identification efficiency than CID data,\nwhich may be due to the lower scores assigned to ECD spectra\nby the database search engines employed. We also find that\npostsearch processing has the largest effect of any individual\ndata processing step (6.4% increase in ECD identifications,\ncompared to 5.3% increase for all preprocessing steps).\nSearch. Ideally, both precursor and fragment mass errors\nshould be specified in ppm, as ppm errors are fairly constant\nacross the measured m\/z range. By contrast, an error of 0.02\nm\/z corresponds to a ppm error of 12.5 for a peak at m\/z 1600,\nbut an error of 50 ppm at m\/z 400. Observed fragment ion\nerrors range from 0 to 12 ppm. Precursor errors can be\nconverted to ppm for postsearch filtering (as we have shown).\nHowever, fragment errors are less easy to convert and filter.\nBoth the Mascot and OMSSA ECD searches employed a\nfragment tolerance of 0.02m\/z, which is not ideal. Nevertheless,\nfragment errors greater than 12 ppm are indicative of an\nincorrect match and are useful information for manual valida-\ntion of identifications.\nWe note that the \u201cMascot decoy\u201d search results in a\nsignificantly lower number of identifications than the other\nsearches. This observation draws attention to the conservative\nnature of the Mascot scoring system, as previously discussed.15\nThe scoring scheme was developed prior to the use of decoy\nsearches to estimate FDR. This type of conservative scoring\nsystem is particularly valuable when the number of identifica-\ntions is too low to allow a meaningful estimate of FDR.\nECD fragmentation of peptides results in both z-dot and\nz-prime fragment ions.5,8,16 Mascot allows identification of both\ntypes. That might be expected to provide an advantage over\nOMSSA, which cannot identify z-prime fragments. We do\nobserve a slightly higher performance for Mascot for the main\ntest data set studied here; however, OMSSA slightly outperforms\nMascot for the phosphopeptide data set (data not shown). Both\nalgorithms perform reasonably well for ECD analysis; however,\nthere is a clear need for a purpose-built ECD\/ETD algorithm.\nPresearch. The starting premise for all presearch DTA\nprocessing is that intense peaks corresponding to anticipated\nc, z or y fragment ions result in high-scoring identifications;\nconversely, intense peaks unattributable to anticipated frag-\nment ions detract from an identification score. We removed,\nor reduced, contributions from three types of uninformative\npeaks: electrical noise peaks, coeluting precursor peaks, and\nneutral loss peaks from the charge-reduced precursors. Each\nof these steps improved both the number of identifications and\nthe average search engine scores of those identifications. Note\nthat neutral loss peaks are not necessarily uninformative;6,7\nhowever, the search engines we employed are incapable of\ninterpreting these peaks. We remove neutral loss peaks only\nfrom ECD mass spectra from doubly charged precursors. This\nenables us to retain every possible true c\/z\/y fragment ion,\nwhile removing all other peaks within a 140 Da region of the\n[M + 2H]\u2022 reduced precursor. An alternative strategy described\nby Good et al. removes a smaller region around all reduced\nprecursors, with the side-effect that some true c\/z\/y fragments\nare also removed.9 Our strategy removes fewer true c\/z\/y\nfragments and results in a greater number of identifications\n(Table 5). Retention of true fragments is facilitated by the high\nresolution ECD MS\/MS data: in the region from [M + 2H]\u2022 -\n57 to -140 m\/z (73 m\/z region), there are 33 potential true\nfragment masses which are retained (Supplemental Table 1).\nHowever, even using a relatively wide retention window of (12\nppm, we retain less than 0.8m\/z of the 73m\/z region. Eighteen\nneutral losses have been described which fall into this 73 m\/z\nregion, and which we remove.6,17\nIn a recent comparison of different search engines for\nidentification of ETDmass spectra, Kandasamy et al. found that\nOMSSA identified far fewer doubly charged peptides than\nMascot.18 We do not find a similarly dramatic difference for\nECD mass spectra: identifications from doubly charged pep-\ntides make up 55% and 61% of the total for OMSSA andMascot,\nrespectively. The shortfall observed by Kandasamy et al. may\nbe related to the fact that y ions were not utilized in their\nOMSSA search. The proportion of identifications from doubly\ncharged peptides approaches the proportion selected for\nfragmentation (67%).\nIn conclusion, we show that search results for ECD data are\nhighly dependent on the search strategy employed, varying\nfrom an identification rate of 19% (Mascot decoy search) up\nto 49% (Mascot search with pre- and postsearch processing).\nWe also demonstrate that the absolute database search engine\npeptide score is unimportant; rather the relative scores of\nforward and reverse hits are more useful in determining correct\nidentifications.\nAcknowledgment.
