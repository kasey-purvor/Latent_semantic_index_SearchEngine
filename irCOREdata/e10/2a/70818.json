INTRODUCTION\nThe stability of nonlinear multistable chaotic systems in the presence of noise is of great importance in relation\nto a number of practical applications, and of obvious interdisciplinary interest. So also are methods for steering\ntransitions between the co-existing chaotic attractors (CAs) in such systems. Quite generally, there are two\ndistinct reasons why unpredictable and complex behavior may occur in a dynamical system. The first of these is\nthe presence of limit sets with complex geometrical structure in phase space, and the second is complex structure\nof the basins of attraction, which may be fractal.5, 6 Understanding the mechanism of fluctuational escape from\na chaotic attractor through a fractal basin boundary (FBB) represents one of the most challenging unsolved\nproblems in fluctuation theory .1\u20134 Its complexity underlies the fact that we have hitherto lacked an answer to\nthe central question: Does there exist a generic mechanism of fluctuational transition through an FBB? More\nspecifically, it has been unclear: (i) whether boundary conditions could be found both on the CA and on the FBB;\n(ii) whether there is a unique escape path from the CA to the FBB; (iii) whether this path can be determined\nusing the Hamiltonian theory of fluctuations; (iv) whether the transition through the FBB itself involves any\ndeterministic structure; and (v) what is the effect of the noise intensity? If general features of the transition\nthrough the FBB do exist, a knowledge of them could considerably simplify analysis of both the stability and\ncontrol of chaotic dynamical systems.\nA promising approach to the solution of this problem is based on the analysis of fluctuations for very small\nnoise intensity. In this limit, a stochastic dynamical system fluctuates to remote states along certain most\nprobable deterministic paths,7\u201311 corresponding to rays in the WKB-like asymptotic solution of the Fokker-\nPlanck equation.12 The possibility of extending such an approach to chaotic continuous and discrete systems\nwas established earlier.1\u20134 It was shown also, that the presence of homoclinic tangencies, which are the reason\nfor fractalization of the basins, causes a decrease in the activation energy.13\nIn this paper we show that a generic mechanism of fluctuational transitions between co-existing CAs separated\nby the FBB does exist, and that it is determined by a hierarchy of homoclinic original saddles forming the\nhomoclinic structure of the FBB. In Sec. 2, we introduce a generic discrete model and describe its dynamics\nbriefly. Section 3 deals with the determination of the boundary conditions on both the FBB and the CA. It is\nshown in Sec. 4 that there is a unique most probable escape path (MPEP) from the CA that approaches an\naccessible orbit on the fractal boundary. The MPEP is found using both a statistical analysis of fluctuational\ntrajectories and the Hamiltonian theory of fluctuations. The effect of noise on the structure of escape paths\ninside the fractal basin is briefly analyzed. Our conclusions are presented in Sec. 5.\nCorrespondence to A.N.S. please.

THE MODEL UNDER STUDY\nTo demonstrate the existence of this escape mechanism, we take as an example the two-dimensional map in-\ntroduced by Holmes.14 The properties of this map, including the structures both of its CA and of its locally\ndisconnected FBB, are generic for a wide class of maps and flow systems.20, 21 This fact, and the results of our\ninvestigations of escape in other systems, allow us to believe that the mechanism of escape we will reveal is in\nfact a typical one. The Holmes map is\nxn+1 = yn (1)\nyn+1 = \u2212b xn + d yn \u2212 y3n + \u03ben,\nwhere \u03ben is zero-mean white Gaussian noise of variance D. Due to symmetry, the noise-free system (1) possesses\npairs of co-existing attractors for b = 0.2 and 2.0 \u2264 d \u2264 2.745 the basins of which are separated by a boundary\nthat may be either smooth or fractal depending on the choice of parameter values. We chose for our studies\nb = 0.2 and d = 2.7, which corresponds to there being two co-existing CAs whose basins are separated by a\nlocally disconnected FBB (see Fig. 1). The fractal dimension of the boundary has been determined numerically\n(dim. = 1.84472) by using the uncertainty exponent technique introduced in.22 For our chosen parameters,\nthe chaotic attractors in (1) appear as the result of a period-doubling cascade, and each of them consists of two\ndisconnected parts.\n3. BOUNDARY CONDITIONS\nWe excited the system (1) with weak noise and collected both the trajectories that include escape paths from one\nCA to the other, and the corresponding realisations of noise that induced these transitions. By averaging a few\nhundred escape trajectories and noise realisations, we obtained the optimal escape path and the corresponding\noptimal force, which are shown in Fig. 2. The results of this statistical analysis allowed us to determine both the\nboundary conditions near the CA and the FBB and to demonstrate the uniqueness of the MPEP. It can be seen\nin particular that the system (1) leaves the CA, falling into a small neighbourhood of the saddle point of period\n1 (S1) located between its two disconnected parts and having the multipliers \u03c11 = 0.118975 and \u03c12 = 1.681025.\nIts stable manifolds separate the parts of the CA, while the unstable ones belong to the CA. Further, the system\nmakes a few iterations in some small neighbourhood of S1 (initial plateau in Fig. 2(a)) and then moves to the FBB\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52\nn\n-2\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\nx\n8 12 16 20 24 28\nn\n-0.03\n-0.02\n-0.01\n0\no\np\nti\nm\nal\n f\no\nrc\ne\nn\n(a)\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n9\n10\n-1.5 -1 -0.5\nx\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\ny\n(b)\nn\nn\nS3\nS3\nS3\nS1\n12\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nFigure 2.

Moreover, its stable\nmanifold (full black curve in Fig. 1) detaches the open neighborhood, including the attractor, from the FBB\nitself. The latter fact allows to classify it as an accessible boundary point.15 Analysis of the structure of escape\npaths inside the FB have shown that the homoclinic saddle points play a key role in its formation. In the system\n(1), we observe an infinite sequence of saddle-node bifurcations of period 3, 4, 5, 6, 7..., which occur at parameter\nvalues d3 < d4 < d5 < d6 < d7... and are caused by the sequent tangencies of the stable and unstable manifolds\nof the saddle point O at origin. The bifurcation diagramm for the few of them presented in Fig. 3(a). The\nhomoclinic orbits appearing as the result of these bifurcations were classified earlier as original saddles and was\nalso shown that their stable and unstable manifolds cross each other in the hierarchical sequence (see Fig. 3(b)).\nThese saddles have the property that their associated eigenvalues of the linearized map are both positive.15 To\ncharacterize this hierarchical relation between original saddles it is reasonable to introduce a parameter \u00b5 equal\nto the ratio | ln(\u03c11(P )) | \/ ln(\u03c12(P )), where \u03c11 and \u03c12 are the multipliers of a saddle point P . Calculations\nhave shown that, for the original saddles with periods 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... in (1), the following hierarchical sequence\nof index \u00b5 values occurs: \u00b53 = 3.339, \u00b54 = 3.08, \u00b55 = 2.999, \u00b56 = 2.339, \u00b57 = 1.958, \u00b58 = 1.539. Moreover,\nthe values of index \u00b5 corresponding to the other homoclinic saddle cycles are close to zero. Correspondingly the\nprobability of finding the system in their neighbourhood tends to zero.\nThese results allows us to formulate generic features of a fluctuational transition through a locally disconnected\nFBB, as follows: (i) it always occurs through a unique accessible boundary point; and (ii) the original saddles\nforming the homoclinic structure of the system (1) play a key role in the formation of the paths inside the\nFBB, and the difference in their local stability defines the hierarchical relationship between them. Thus, we may\nclaim that the complicated structure of escape trajectories, caused by the thin homoclinic structure and their\nrandomness, has in many respects a deterministic nature.\n4. MOST PROBABLE ESCAPE PATH\nAn understanding of the escape mechanism allows us to find the MPEP. According to the Hamiltonian theory\nof fluctuations1\u20134 the MPEP is the path which minimizes the energy\nS =\n1\n2\nN\u2211\nn=1\n\u03beTn \u03ben, (2)\n2.45 2.5 2.55 2.6 2.65 2.7\nd\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n0.35\n0.4\nb\nperiod-3\nperiod-4\nperiod-5\nperiod-6\nperiod-7\n(a) 3\n4\n5\n6\n(b)\nFigure 3.

(4)\nThe MPEP is the minimum-energy heteroclinic trajectory in the phase space of (3) connecting S1 and S3. The\nsolution of this boundary value problem is in general complicated because of the presence of multiple local\nminima of the energy17 induced by the complex geometrical structure of the unstable manifolds of S3 in the\nphase space of (1) (see e.g. Graham and Tel19 for a discussion). A technique for solving the boundary value\nproblem was introduced recently.18 It involves a parameterization of the structure of the multiple local minima\nby making a proper parameterization of the unstable manifold in the vicinity of the initial conditions. The\nMPEP found by this method is shown in the Fig. 2. It can be seen from Fig. 2, that the MPEP predicted by the\nHamiltonian theory coincides with that obtained using statistical analysis of the escape trajectories in Monte\nCarlo simulations. Note that no action is required to bring the system to another attractor after it arrives on\nthe accessible orbit on the FBB.\nThe existence of an almost deterministic mechanism of transition via the FBB itself raises an important\nquestion about the effect of noise on this mechanism.

Probabilities of finding a fragment corresponding to the different period-T original saddle cycle in the collected\nescape trajectories.\nescape trajectories inside the FBB we used randomly chosen initial conditions in a very small neighborhood of\nthe accessible point S3 through which the escape occurs (see Fig. 2(b)). By definition of the FBB, any arbitrarily\nsmall neighborhood of S3 contains points that belong to the basin of the other attractor. Therefore the system\nmay cross the FBB starting from a very small neighborhood of S3 even in the absence of noise. Collecting all\nsuccessful escape paths, we calculated the probabilities for the system to pass via small neighborhoods of different\noriginal saddle cycles during its escape both in the presence and in the absence of noise. As can be seen from\nFig. 4, the corresponding probabilities demonstrate the same hierarchical interrelationship in both cases. This\nhierarchical interrelationship is determined by the value of index \u00b5 defined above. This structure is robust with\nrespect to the noise-induced perturbations. The addition of noise causes a small broadening of the distribution\nin Fig. 4 and a small increase of the probability for the system to escape via original saddles of larger period.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, we have described the mechanism by which noise-induced escape occurs through a locally dis-\nconnected FBB. We have found the (unique) most probable escape path from a chaotic attractor to the fractal\nboundary, using both statistical analyses of fluctuational trajectories, and the Hamiltonian theory of fluctua-\ntions. We have shown that the original saddles forming the homoclinic structure play a key role in effecting the\ntransition through the FBB itself. In particular, their local stability defines the hierarchical relationship between\nthe probabilities for the system to pass via small neighborhoods of different original saddle cycles during its\nescape, both in the presence and in the absence of noise. We emphasize that the escape mechanism we have\nrevealed must be applicable to the broad class of two dimensional maps and flows14, 20, 21 that exhibit the same\ntype of FBB. For instance, one possible application of our results is to the development of an energy-optimal\ncontrol scheme for the CO2 laser, a discrete model of which demonstrates the type of FBB considered above.23\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank Ulrike Feidel, Suso Kraut and Igor Khovanov for fruitful discussions.
