III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A few of the most widely used PY materials, such as PZT PZT-5H and PZT-5A, 14,15 BTO, 23\u201325 lithium tantalate LTO, 26 lithium niobate LNO, 26 and PVDF, 27\u201330 were paired with six different NP materials with wide ranging thermal and elastic properties, namely, stainless steel St, 13 polytetra\ufb02uoroethylene PTFE or Te\ufb02on, 31 chlorinated polyvinyl chloride CPVC thermoplastic, 32\u201334 aluminum, 34,35 zinc, 34,36 and Invar 36, 37,38 to analyze their OC PY coef\ufb01-cient alteration credentials. Although all the 36 pairs were examined, in this communication the conclusions of only selected few with the most interesting results are presented. Tables I and II elucidate the difference between material properties under SC and OC. In particular, materials with high pm T,E such as PZT, BTO, and LTO show the largest change in their thermal expansion coef\ufb01cient due to the fourth relation stated earlier in Sec. II B. This signi\ufb01cant change in their thermal expansion behavior also leads to substantial change in their secondary contribution to the overall PY coef\ufb01cient under OC, pm T,D. For PZT, LTO, and LNO the magnitude of PY coef\ufb01cient is greater under OC, while the opposite is true for others as illustrated in Table II. This suggests that where secondary PY coef\ufb01cient is concerned, it is rather dif\ufb01cult to anticipate its contribution to overall PY coef\ufb01cient under both SC and OC condition until all the components, such as the thermal expansion coef\ufb01cients and signs of the secondary part, are all identi\ufb01ed and their interactions assessed for the overall impact. Table III further reinforces this view as the signs of the secondary PY coef\ufb01-cients are only different from that of under SC in materials such as LTO, LNO, and PVDF despite the expected change of sign from Eq. 6, owing largely to signi\ufb01cant change in the thermal expansion coef\ufb01cients as displayed in Table I. For instance, although Eq. 6 suggests PZT-5H\u2019s secondary PY coef\ufb01cient under OC could have the opposite sign from that under SC, valued at \u22120.47310\u22124 Cm \u22122 K\u22121, it actually evaluates to \u221218.59310\u22124 Cm \u22122 K\u22121 since its thermal expansion coef\ufb01cients are altered so drastically under OC as apparent from Table I. Meanwhile, LTO\u2019s secondary PY coef. under OC valued at \u22120.19510\u22124 Cm \u22122 K\u22121 has the opposite sign from that under SC, 0.10310\u22124 Cm \u22122 K\u22121 as the thermal expansion coef\ufb01cients of LTO are not changed as severely from the transition of electrical conditions. A. PZT-5H Since the behavior of PZT-5A is very similar to that of PZT-5H, only the results of PZT-5H will be provided. It is evident from Tables I and II that PZT-5H is the main bene\ufb01-ciary of the increased PY coef\ufb01cient under OC owing to TABLE II.

PVDF As mentioned earlier, PVDF experienced reduced PY coef\ufb01cient under OC. Although the difference in the magnitude of the overall PY coef\ufb01cient is quite small, the introduction of NP materials does affect the PY coef\ufb01cient of PVDF as depicted in Fig. 9. Introduction of PTFE or CPVC leads to enhancement while others results in reduction with both PVDF-PTFE and PVDF-CPVC reaching their maximum values of approximately \u22120.2810\u22124 Cm \u22122 K\u22121 at Rmin. Another measure for the performance of NP elastic layers is shown in Fig. 10. It demonstrates how much of an alteration potential the introduction of NP material has on the secondary PY coef\ufb01cient of PVDF. The reason behind our preference for this method of comparison to that utilized in Fig. 9 is due to the fact that the secondary contribution of PVDF\u2019s PY coef\ufb01cient varies quite signi\ufb01cantly from a sample of PVDF to another owing largely to their preparation process, hence making ample assessment of alternation in secondary effect dif\ufb01cult. At Rmin, PVDF-Invar36 pair presents the greatest change of 960% and PVDF-St about 720%, with St outperforming both Al and Zn, unlike with other PY materials. Since the overall PY coef\ufb01cient is negative while the secondary PY coef\ufb01cient of PVDF alone under OC is positive, both Invar36 and St results in the reduction in the overall PY coef\ufb01cient\u2019s magnitude. However, with negative percentile secondary contributions PTFE and CPVC leads to enhancement. At Rmin, PVDF-PTFE peaks at 420% while PVDF-CPVC reaches 450%, both indicating over 300% increase in the secondary PY coef\ufb01cient of the PVDF composites, which potentially points to extremely large enhancement in other PVDF samples with greater proportion of secondary contribution. Figure 11 depicts F a eff behavior of PVDF pairs. Only PTFE and CPVC exhibit improvement in ef\ufb01ciency while Al and Zn nearly approach F a eff=1 mark, which St and Invar36 fail to do. At Rmin, maximum F a eff of 3.4 is attained by PVDF-PTFE, while PVDF-CPVC pair reaches 1.8, both indicating signi\ufb01cant improvement in ef\ufb01-ciency. F. Best performing pairs In terms of the pure magnitude of the PY coef\ufb01cient, PZT-5H is the best performing PY material as illustrated in Fig. 1. PZT-5H-CPVC pair\u2019s huge PY coef\ufb01cient of 97 10\u22124 Cm \u22122 K\u22121 at Rmin and around 4010\u22124 Cm \u22122 K\u22121 at R=0.022 after which PZT-5H-Zn takes over as the optimum PY coef\ufb01cient pair are unrivaled by all of the PY materials investigated. As far as F a eff is concerned, PZT-5APTFE achieves 24, PZT-5H-CPVC 9.4, BTO-CPVC 12, and PVDF-PTFE obtains 3.4 at Rmin, while LTO-PTFE and LNO-PTFE attain 2.4 and 3.63, respectively, at R=0.025. PZT-5A, LTO, and PVDF all fail to register any pair that exhibited improvement in the ef\ufb01ciency with F b eff. However, PZT-5H-PTFE reaches F b eff 1a tR 1.0, BTO-PTFE at R  1.1, and LNO-PTFE at R 0.95. It has to be said that certain assumptions made in the thermal expansion coef\ufb01cients under SC, for example, PZT manufacturer\u2019s data on coef\ufb01cients of all three axes being the same, which are used to evaluate the thermal expansion coef\ufb01cients under OC, make the numerical values of our secondary PY coef\ufb01cients open to discussion. IV. SUMMARY In summary, we have developed a mathematical model for the PY effect under OC condition and simulated 2-2 connectivity enhancement phenomena under such condition for 36 pairs of PY and NP materials. The investigated PY materials are PZT PZT-5H and PZT-5A, BTO, LTO, LNO, and PVDF, while the NP materials are stainless steel, PTFE Te\ufb02on, CPVC thermoplastic, aluminum, zinc, and Invar 36. On the whole, in terms of the magnitude of the PY coef\ufb01-cient change, Zn outperforms Al\/St and CPVC outperforms PTFE in all the pairings with PY materials except PVDF, in which case it was the opposite due to PVDF\u2019s extremely high thermal expansion coef\ufb01cient.

However, where the \ufb01gure of merit for ef\ufb01ciency is concerned, this does not always hold since PTFE and Al possess lower volumetric heat capacity than CPVC and Zn, respectively. Extraordinarily large PY coef\ufb01cient of 9710\u22124 Cm \u22122 K\u22121 at Rmin is expected for PZT-5H-CPVC while PVDF-CPVC could show increase in the secondary PY coef\ufb01cient of up to 350%. In addition, where the \ufb01gure of merit for ef\ufb01ciency is concerned, for the same volume of the composite PZT-5APTFE it reaches a 24-fold increase in ef\ufb01ciency, while F b eff indicates in most pairings under OC, it will struggle to achieve the same level of ef\ufb01ciency when additional NP materials are introduced for PY coef\ufb01cient alteration. It is clear from our analysis that there indeed is a substantial dissimilarity between the PY coef\ufb01cients and \ufb01gure of merit for ef\ufb01ciency for various PY-NP pairs under SC and OC. We believe this implies that there should be a greater distinction made between the PY coef\ufb01cients under SC and OC than previously thought. Our analysis techniques provide a methodology for assessing the potentials of particular PY material and its 2-2 laminates for applications under OC condition. For instance, appraising employment credentials of LTO or LNO in applications such as PY X-ray generation, 4\u20136 electron accelerator, 7 and nuclear fusion. 8 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Professor R.

Although some enhancement on the magnitude of the PY coef\ufb01cient is achieved, it is not enough to drive F b eff to higher than one in all the pairs except one. BTO-PTFE pair is the only one which possesses F b eff 1 reaching maximum of 1.05 at R=2.00, while all the others indicate reduction in ef\ufb01ciency due to increased thermal mass. BTO-Invar36 is the second best performing pair for BTO, which is quite surprising considering Invar36\u2019s rather high volumetric heat capacity of 5.15106 Jm \u22123 K\u22121, the highest among all NP and PY materials considered. C. LTO Figure 5 displays the PY coef\ufb01cients for LTO pairs. All the pairs except LTO-Invar36 show reduction in the PY coef\ufb01cient with LTO-CPVC reaching minimum of \u22122.127 10\u22124 Cm \u22122 K\u22121 and LTO-Invar36 maximum of \u22122.725 10\u22124 Cm \u22122 K\u22121 at Rmin. All in all, LTO behaves similar to BTO with the exception of sign change in the PY coef\ufb01cients owing to the limited secondary effect contribution to the overall PY coef\ufb01cient. Although most of the pairs show reduction in the PY coef\ufb01cient magnitude, some manage to show improvement in ef\ufb01ciency where the same volume of the composites are concerned F a eff as illustrated in Fig. 6. LTO-PTFE pair exhibits peak of approximately 2.4 at R =0.025 and maintains F a eff 1 throughout the R range investigated with the minimum of 1.4 at R=1.005. LTO-CPVC also manages F a eff 1 throughout the R range although at much smaller values of 1.1F a eff1.2. The reasons behind these improvements are the exceptionally low volumetric heat capacities of PTFE and CPVC, again leading to good F a eff values. D. LNO The behaviors of the PY coef\ufb01cients of LNO pairs are very similar to that of LTO pairs in Fig. 5. Figure 7 demonstrates how similar they are by displaying the secondary PY effect contributions to the overall PY coef\ufb01cient arising from the introduction of the NP materials. LNO-Invar36 is again the only pair that exhibits enhancement in the secondary PY coef\ufb01cient, and hence the overall PY coef\ufb01cient, while LNO-Zn shows reduction but falls short of changing the sign of the secondary effect. LNO-CPVC, however, displays both reduction and change in sign in the secondary PY coef\ufb01cient. The maximum secondary PY coef\ufb01cient observed is \u22120.24410\u22124 Cm \u22122 K\u22121 at Rmin by LNO-Invar36 pair, which corresponds to around 31% increase in the secondary PY coef\ufb01cient from the introduction of Invar36 to LNO. As evident from Fig. 8, where F a eff is concerned LNO-PTFE performs the best with the optimum F a eff value of 3.63 at R=0.025 due to PTFE\u2019s lowest volumetric heat capacity among all the materials investigated. LNO-CPVC pair does not fare too badly either with the optimum of 1.84 at R =0.065, while other pairs exhibiting improvement in the ef\ufb01ciency also include LNO-Al and LNO-Zn, whose F a eff lie very near to one. -0.00028 -0.00027 -0.00026 -0.00025 -0.00024 -0.00023 -0.00022 -0.00021 -0.00020 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 Thickness ratio R T o t a l p y r o e l e c t r i c c o e f f i c i e n t ( C m -2 K -1 ) LTO-CPVC LTO-Zn LTO-Invar36 LTO alone FIG. 5.

INTRODUCTION\nIt is well established that the pyroelectric coefficient \u0001PY\ncoef.\u0002, usually measured at constant stress pT,E, consists of\nthe primary PY coef. at the constant strain pS,E and the sec-\nondary PY coef. arising from strain,1\npm\nT,E\n= pm\nS,E + dmkl\nE,\u0002cijkl\nE,\u0002\u0003ij\nT,E\n. \u00011\u0002\nHere, T is the stress, E is the electric field, \u0002 is the tempera-\nture, pm\nT,E is the PY coefficient at constant stress \u0001free\nboundary condition\u0002 and electric field, dmkl\nE,\u0002 is the piezo-\nelectric constant, cijkl\nE,\u0002 is the elastic stiffness at constant\ntemperature and electric field, and \u0003ij\nT,E is the thermal ex-\npansion coefficient at constant stress and electric field. No-\ntice the Einstein summation convention is used throughout\nthis article along with the Voigt notation and the secondary\nPY effect can be regarded as a product property of piezoelec-\ntricity and thermal expansion.2\nIn our other communication,3 with Eq. \u00011\u0002 in mind, the\nlaws of thermodynamics dictated the PY coefficient for 2-2\nlaminates under short circuit \u0001SC\u0002 condition to be\nPm =\ndDm\nd\u0002\n= pm\nT,E\n\u2212 \u0001dmkl\nE,\u0002\u0002\u0001cijkl\nE,\u0002\u0002\u0005\u0003ijT,E \u2212 dSijd\u0002 \u0006 ,\n\u00012\u0002\nwhere pm is the PY coefficient, Dm is the electric displace-\nment, and dSij is the total strain experienced by the PY ma-\nterial.\nThis extended version of the PY coefficient expression,\nEq. \u00012\u0002, describes the pyroelectricity of any PY material ex-\nperiencing strain under SC condition. However, in practice,\nsome applications such as PY X-ray generation,4\u20136 electron\naccelerator,7 and nuclear fusion8 are conducted under condi-\ntions most closely approximated by open circuit \u0001OC\u0002. We\nbelieve there is a difference between the PY coefficient under\nOC and SC conditions, and it is paramount that this disparity\nbetween the two be formulized to provide better insights into\nthese applications of pyroelectricity. We also believe that this\nPY coefficient pT,D under OC condition is the one that should\nbe utilized when evaluating the \u201cvoltage figure of merit\u201d FV\nand hence be distinguished from pT,E used in \u201ccurrent figure\nof merit\u201d FI.\n9\nUnder SC condition, the electric potential on the whole\nof the surface of the crystal is perceived as being the same, in\nother words E is assumed to be zero and constant, i.e., E\n=0=dE. Sometimes also termed as electrically free, this is\nthe condition under which most measurements of PY coeffi-\ncient are taken and therefore is the condition conventionally\nused for the derivation of PY coefficient, including Eq. \u00012\u0002.\nUnder OC condition, however, D is assumed to be constanta\u0002Electronic mail: h.chang@cranfield.ac.uk.\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS 106, 014101 \u00012009\u0002\n0021-8979\/2009\/106\u00021\u0001\/014101\/9\/$25.00 \u00a9 2009 American Institute of Physics106, 014101-1\nDownloaded 05 May 2010 to 138.250.112.33.

This implies dD=\u00040dE+dP=0, where P is po-\nlarization, and hence the need for a different PY coefficient\nexpression from that of Eqs. \u00011\u0002 and \u00012\u0002. In general, when\nD=0 the crystal is said to be electrically clamped.\nIn a previous communication, we reported a substantial\nPY coefficient enhancement in laminar stainless steel\/lead\nzirconate titanate \u0001PZT\u0002\/stainless steel structures,3 with both\nexperimental observation and theoretical prediction demon-\nstrating PY coefficient enhancements of more than 100% un-\nder SC condition. We believe the employment of 2-2 connec-\ntivity configuration in pyroelectricity under OC condition\nalso requires further exploration which could potentially un-\ncover PY coefficient alterations of great proportions. The\nfindings of this investigation are presented in this article.\nAt the outset in Sec. II, we first examine the theoretical\nand mathematical background behind this by applying ther-\nmodynamic and plate theory to the OC condition, results of\nwhich are presented in later section with the use of Math-\nematics package MAPLE 9.50.10 In order to analyze the effects\nof increased thermal mass due to the introduction of NP elas-\ntic layer, we also define a quantity termed efficiency and\nutilize it to assess the trade-off between thermal budget and\nincreased PY response by the means of figure of merit for\nefficiency, namely, Faeff and F\nb\neff. The choice of materials\nand the reasons behind this preference are presented, while\nthe outcomes of the ensuing mathematical simulations and\ncorresponding conclusions are demonstrated in Secs. III and\nIV.\nII. GENERAL THEORETICAL ANALYSIS\nA. Pyroelectric coefficient under OC condition\nIn order to enable the mathematical model to describe\nour PY coefficient alteration, a more general case of the\nabove expression \u00011\u0002 that is analogous to the OC case of Eq.\n\u00012\u0002 needs to be derived from the thermodynamic principles\nsince the final configuration will consist of a PY material\nattached to a thermally active material, namely, NP material,\nwhich will then exert \u201cthermally motivated external\u201d stress\nonto the PY material under OC condition. So, we derive the\nexpression for the PY coef. \u0001pi\u0002 from its fundamental\ndefinition,1,9 pi=\u0005PSi \/\u0005\u0002=dPSi \/d\u0002, i=1\u20133, where dPSi is\nthe change in spontaneous polarization vector\u2019s component\nin the i-direction, d\u0002 is the change in temperature, \u0005PSi is\nthe dipole moment per unit volume, i.e., spontaneous polar-\nization, in the i-direction, \u0005\u0002 is the uniform temperature\nchange, and pi is the PY coef. in the i-direction. Also, D\n=\u00040E+P in any dielectric material and P=PS+Pind in piezo-\nor PY materials with Pind=\u00040 \u0001e E,\n11 implying D=\u00040 \u0002r E\n+PS and hence PSi=Di\u2212\u00040 \u0001\u0004r\u0002i Ei. Therefore for OC condi-\ntion \u0001dDi=0\u0002,\npi = dPSi\/d\u0002 = \u2212 \u00040\u0001\u0004r\u0002idEi\/d\u0002 , \u00013\u0002\nwhere P is the total polarization, PS is the spontaneous po-\nlarization, D is the electric displacement, E is the electric\nfield \u0001intensity\u0002, Pind is the induced polarization owing to E,\n\u0001e=\u0002r\u2212I is the dielectric susceptibility, I is the identity\nmatrix\/vector, \u00040 is the permittivity of free space, and \u0002r is\nthe relative dielectric constant.\nNow, define Gibbs free energy, G, of a piezoelectric\ncrystal as1,12 G=U\u2212SijTkl\u2212DmEn\u2212\u0006\u0002, where i , j ,k , l ,m ,n\n=1\u20133.

This indicates that the PY\ncoefficient under OC can vary greatly from that under SC\ncondition since where the secondary effect is an enhance-\nment will lead to reduction and vice versa for these two\ndiffering conditions, provided the same amount of strain is\napplied. Indeed, our analysis illustrates that the enhancement\nunder SC leads to reduction under OC, but due to the sheer\nmagnitude of the secondary effect it can lead to change in\nsign in the PY coefficient itself where very large alteration of\nthe PY coefficient is achieved at very low thickness ratios R\nfor PY materials that demonstrated relatively large enhance-\nments under SC such as PZT and barium titanate \u0001BTO\u0002.\n014101-2 H.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nIt is evident from Eq. \u00016\u0002 that larger the strain the non-\npyroelectric \u0001NP\u0002 component can exert on PY component\nand greater the piezoelectric coefficient of the PY material,\nbigger the change in secondary contribution. This leads to\nthe conclusion that stiffer NP material with greater disparity\nin thermal expansion coefficient \u0001\u0003\u0002 with that of PY and\nmore compliant PY material with high piezoelectric coeffi-\ncients would lead to largest PY coefficient alteration.\nB. Material properties under OC condition\nBefore we move on to evaluating the PY coefficients\nunder OC condition, we must first mention some of the re-\nlationship between various material properties evaluated un-\nder SC and OC. The information on the material properties\nrequired for the evaluation of Eq. \u00012\u0002 is largely available\nfrom various sources such as the manufacturers.13\u201315 How-\never, Eq. \u00016\u0002 poses significantly more difficult challenge\nsince most manufacturers provide measurements evaluated\nunder SC. Therefore, here we establish some of the relations\nbetween the two sets of parameters based on various\nsources.\n1,12,16,17\n1. Primary PY coefficients under SC and OC\nThere is little in the literature which explicitly deals with\nthis issue. As the primary PY coefficient is an intrinsic prop-\nerty of the material, we assume the following equality rela-\ntionship between the primary PY coefficients under SC and\nOC, namely, Pm\nS,E and Pm\nS,D\n, respectively; pm\nS,E\n= pm\nS,D\n.\nFrom Eqs. \u00011\u0002, \u00012\u0002, and \u00016\u0002 we have\npm\nT,E\n\u2212 \u0001dmkl\nE,\u0002\u0002\u0001cijkl\nE,\u0002\u0002\u0001\u0003ij\nT,E\u0002 = pm\nT,D + \u0001dmkl\nD,\u0002\u0002\n\u0001\u0001cijkl\nD,\u0002\u0002\u0001\u0003ij\nT,D\u0002 ,\nwhich implies\npm\nT,D\n= pm\nT,E\n\u2212 \u0001dmkl\nE,\u0002\u0002\u0001cijkl\nE,\u0002\u0002\u0001\u0003ij\nT,E\u0002 \u2212 \u0001dmkl\nD,\u0002\u0002\n\u0001\u0001cijkl\nD,\u0002\u0002\u0001\u0003ij\nT,D\u0002 .\nWe notice the fact that there is no distinction between the\nprimary coefficients under SC and OC in the work of Grout\net al.18 and the same value for the PY coefficient was used\nfor both SC and OC cases of the PY expression derived by\nPloss et al.,19 which supports this equality assumption.\n2. Piezoelectric constants under SC and OC\nConventionally, the piezoelectric constants are assumed\nto be the same under both SC and OC since the elastic co-\nefficients, which will be multiplied to the piezoelectric con-\nstant to describe the overall piezoelectric effect, will reflect\nthe consequences of this electrical condition on the overall\npiezoelectric effect. Hence, dmkl\nE,\u0002\n=dmkl\nD,\u0002\n.\n3.

It\nmust be noted that although Eq. \u00017\u0002 is applicable to any PY\nmaterial universally, Eq. \u00018\u0002 is a simplified form of the solu-\ntion to the force balance equation with certain assumptions\non the symmetry of the PY material assumed, which all but\none, namely, polyvinylidene fluoride \u0001PVDF\u0002, PY materials\nexplored in this article suffice. The assumptions made are\nPY\u0003= PY\u0003 j for all j=1\u20132, s13=s23, c11=c22, c12=c21, and\nc23=c31. PVDF does not satisfy these relations, and hence for\nPVDF we implemented the full solution to the force balance\nequation, the consequences of which are elucidated in Sec.\nIII E, although the solution itself is not presented in this trea-\ntise due to space constraints.\nD. Thermal budget and efficiency\nWe define a measure termed \u201cefficiency \u0001eff\u0002\u201d and use it\nto measure how efficiently our PY structures convert heat\nenergy into electricity, and compare that of PY material alone\nand our altered laminate composite.\nIn order to make comparison, we also define a \u201cfigure of\nmerit for efficiency\u201d by Feff= comeff \/ PYeff, where PYeff de-\nnotes the efficiency of the pure PY material and comeff that of\ncomposite. Depending on the application, we have two dif-\nferent expressions for Feff.\n\u0001a\u0002 First is the ratio between the same total volume of PY\nmaterial and 2-2 connectivity composite, namely, Faeff,\nwhich will result in the ratio between a 2-2 connectiv-\nity composite and a PY material with the same thick-\nness as the total thickness of the composite \u0001this means\nthe thickness of the PY material used in the composite\nis thinner than the stand alone PY material\u0002.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA few of the most widely used PY materials, such as\nPZT \u0001PZT-5H and PZT-5A\u0002,14,15 BTO,23\u201325 lithium tantalate\n\u0001LTO\u0002,26 lithium niobate \u0001LNO\u0002,26 and PVDF,27\u201330 were\npaired with six different NP materials with wide ranging\nthermal and elastic properties, namely, stainless steel \u0001St\u0002,13\npolytetrafluoroethylene \u0001PTFE or Teflon\u0002,31 chlorinated poly-\nvinyl chloride \u0001CPVC\u0002 thermoplastic,32\u201334 aluminum,34,35\nzinc,34,36 and Invar 36,37,38 to analyze their OC PY coeffi-\ncient alteration credentials. Although all the 36 pairs were\nexamined, in this communication the conclusions of only\nselected few with the most interesting results are presented.\nTables I and II elucidate the difference between material\nproperties under SC and OC. In particular, materials with\nhigh pm\nT,E such as PZT, BTO, and LTO show the largest\nchange in their thermal expansion coefficient due to the\nfourth relation stated earlier in Sec. II B. This significant\nchange in their thermal expansion behavior also leads to sub-\nstantial change in their secondary contribution to the overall\nPY coefficient under OC, pm\nT,D\n. For PZT, LTO, and LNO the\nmagnitude of PY coefficient is greater under OC, while the\nopposite is true for others as illustrated in Table II. This\nsuggests that where secondary PY coefficient is concerned, it\nis rather difficult to anticipate its contribution to overall PY\ncoefficient under both SC and OC condition until all the\ncomponents, such as the thermal expansion coefficients and\nsigns of the secondary part, are all identified and their inter-\nactions assessed for the overall impact. Table III further re-\ninforces this view as the signs of the secondary PY coeffi-\ncients are only different from that of under SC in materials\nsuch as LTO, LNO, and PVDF despite the expected change\nof sign from Eq. \u00016\u0002, owing largely to significant change in\nthe thermal expansion coefficients as displayed in Table I.\nFor instance, although Eq. \u00016\u0002 suggests PZT-5H\u2019s secondary\nPY coefficient under OC could have the opposite sign from\nthat under SC, valued at \u22120.473\u000110\u22124 C m\u22122 K\u22121, it actu-\nally evaluates to \u221218.593\u000110\u22124 C m\u22122 K\u22121 since its thermal\nexpansion coefficients are altered so drastically under OC as\napparent from Table I. Meanwhile, LTO\u2019s secondary PY\ncoef. under OC valued at \u22120.195\u000110\u22124 C m\u22122 K\u22121 has the\nopposite sign from that under SC, 0.103\u000110\u22124 C m\u22122 K\u22121\nas the thermal expansion coefficients of LTO are not changed\nas severely from the transition of electrical conditions.\nA. PZT-5H\nSince the behavior of PZT-5A is very similar to that of\nPZT-5H, only the results of PZT-5H will be provided. It is\nevident from Tables I and II that PZT-5H is the main benefi-\nciary of the increased PY coefficient under OC owing to\nTABLE II.

Its PY coef-\nficient under OC is \u221223.1\u000110\u22124 C m\u22122 K\u22121, whereas under\nSC this is only \u22125.0\u000110\u22124 C m\u22122 K\u22121. In addition, its\ndc1\r\u0001d3i\u0002\u0001c1i\u0002, dc2\r\u0001d3i\u0002\u0001c2i\u0002, and dc3\r\u0001d3i\u0002\u0001c3i\u0002 values un-\nder OC is also about 5.4 times larger than that under SC,\nleading to larger contribution from the secondary effect to\nthe overall PY coefficient, as depicted in Fig. 1. It is evident\nfrom Fig. 1 that what was an enhancement under SC at low\nthickness ratios \u0001R\u0002 is a reduction under OC due to the sign\nof the secondary effect demonstrated in Eq. \u00016\u0002, meanwhile\nthe secondary contribution can be so large at very low R\nvalues that it actually switches the sign of the overall PY\ncoefficient to the positive region peaking at huge PY coeffi-\ncient of 97\u000110\u22124 C m\u22122 K\u22121 at R=0.005 \u0001minimum R value\nevaluated, namely, Rmin\u0002 for PZT-5H-CPVC thermoplastic\npair and around 40\u000110\u22124 C m\u22122 K\u22121 at R=Rmin for PZT-\n5H-Zinc \u0001Zn\u0002 pair. The R value at which the sign change in\nthe total PY coefficient occurs is smaller for NP materials\nwith lower Young\u2019s modulus and thermal expansion coeffi-\ncients as expected.\nFigure 2 describes the figure of merit for efficiency be-\nlonging to the same volume of PZT-5H and its composites\n\u0001Faeff\u0002. They all reach the value of zero at certain values of R\nowing to the PY coefficient switching between negative and\npositive signs at low R values. PZT-5H-CPVC pair peaks to\naround 9.4 at Rmin \u0001R=0.005\u0002 while PZT-5H-PTFE reaches\nits maximum of approximately 7.0 at the same Rmin. It is\napparent from Fig. 2 that both pairs mentioned above have\nreasonably high Faeff, between 2.6 and 1.3, for the whole of\nthe R range considered, insinuating improvement in the effi-\nciencies of PZT-5H when CPVC or PTFE is attached. Zn and\nAl pairs fail to reach figure of merit for efficiency of higher\nthan one except at R\u000b0.230 and R\u000b0.110, respectively, and\nthis trend is expected to continue at R values higher than one\nas increasing R means less volume of NP material attached\nand hence the overall PY coefficient converging to that of\nPZT-5H alone.\nB. BTO\nBTO and PVDF were the only PY materials that experi-\nenced reduced PY coefficient under OC when compared to\nthat evaluated under SC. Although BTO\u2019s thermal expansion\ncoefficients also experienced quite a large change, \u00033\nD in\nparticular as exhibited in Table I, the change in its dc1, dc2,\nand dc3 meant that the overall secondary effect under OC is\ndrastically reduced to approximately \u22120.079\n\u000110\u22124 C m\u22122 K\u22121, which is only about one eighth of that\nunder SC.\nAs is evident from Fig. 3, BTO-CPVC attains the highest\ntotal PY coefficient of 7.6\u000110\u22124 C m\u22122 K\u22121 at R=Rmin and\nmaintains its superiority until R=0.05 at which point\nBTO-Zn takes over as the dominant pair. However, BTO-\nInvar36 is the only pair that consistently outperforms BTO\u2019s\nown PY coefficient as it is the only pair that has PY coeffi-\ncient more negative than \u22121.461\u000110\u22124 C m\u22122 K\u22121, the PY\ncoefficient of BTO under OC, with maximum value of ap-\nproximately \u22123.14\u000110\u22124 C m\u22122K\u22121 at Rmin, owing to\nInvar36\u2019s unusually small thermal expansion coefficient.

BTO-PTFE pair is\nthe only one which possesses Fbeff\n1 reaching maximum of\n1.05 at R=2.00, while all the others indicate reduction in\nefficiency due to increased thermal mass. BTO-Invar36 is the\nsecond best performing pair for BTO, which is quite surpris-\ning considering Invar36\u2019s rather high volumetric heat capac-\nity of 5.15\u0001106 J m\u22123 K\u22121, the highest among all NP and\nPY materials considered.\nC. LTO\nFigure 5 displays the PY coefficients for LTO pairs. All\nthe pairs except LTO-Invar36 show reduction in the PY co-\nefficient with LTO-CPVC reaching minimum of \u22122.127\n\u000110\u22124 C m\u22122 K\u22121 and LTO-Invar36 maximum of \u22122.725\n\u000110\u22124 C m\u22122 K\u22121 at Rmin. All in all, LTO behaves similar to\nBTO with the exception of sign change in the PY coefficients\nowing to the limited secondary effect contribution to the\noverall PY coefficient. Although most of the pairs show re-\nduction in the PY coefficient magnitude, some manage to\nshow improvement in efficiency where the same volume of\nthe composites are concerned \u0001Faeff\u0002 as illustrated in Fig. 6.\nLTO-PTFE pair exhibits peak of approximately 2.4 at R\n=0.025 and maintains Faeff\n1 throughout the R range inves-\ntigated with the minimum of 1.4 at R=1.005. LTO-CPVC\nalso manages Faeff\n1 throughout the R range although at\nmuch smaller values of 1.1\u000bFaeff\u000b1.2. The reasons behind\nthese improvements are the exceptionally low volumetric\nheat capacities of PTFE and CPVC, again leading to good\nFaeff values.\nD. LNO\nThe behaviors of the PY coefficients of LNO pairs are\nvery similar to that of LTO pairs in Fig. 5. Figure 7 demon-\nstrates how similar they are by displaying the secondary PY\neffect contributions to the overall PY coefficient arising from\nthe introduction of the NP materials. LNO-Invar36 is again\nthe only pair that exhibits enhancement in the secondary PY\ncoefficient, and hence the overall PY coefficient, while\nLNO-Zn shows reduction but falls short of changing the sign\nof the secondary effect. LNO-CPVC, however, displays both\nreduction and change in sign in the secondary PY coefficient.\nThe maximum secondary PY coefficient observed is\n\u22120.244\u000110\u22124 C m\u22122 K\u22121 at Rmin by LNO-Invar36 pair,\nwhich corresponds to around 31% increase in the secondary\nPY coefficient from the introduction of Invar36 to LNO. As\nevident from Fig. 8, where Faeff is concerned LNO-PTFE\nperforms the best with the optimum Faeff value of 3.63 at\nR=0.025 due to PTFE\u2019s lowest volumetric heat capacity\namong all the materials investigated. LNO-CPVC pair does\nnot fare too badly either with the optimum of 1.84 at R\n=0.065, while other pairs exhibiting improvement in the ef-\nficiency also include LNO-Al and LNO-Zn, whose Faeff lie\nvery near to one.\n-0.00028\n-0.00027\n-0.00026\n-0.00025\n-0.00024\n-0.00023\n-0.00022\n-0.00021\n-0.00020\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0\nThickness ratio R\nTo\nta\nlp\nyr\noe\nle\nct\nric\nco\nef\nfic\nie\nnt\n(C\nm\n-2\nK\n-1\n)\nLTO-CPVC LTO-Zn\nLTO-Invar36 LTO alone\nFIG. 5.

PVDF\nAs mentioned earlier, PVDF experienced reduced PY\ncoefficient under OC. Although the difference in the magni-\ntude of the overall PY coefficient is quite small, the introduc-\ntion of NP materials does affect the PY coefficient of PVDF\nas depicted in Fig. 9. Introduction of PTFE or CPVC leads to\nenhancement while others results in reduction with both\nPVDF-PTFE and PVDF-CPVC reaching their maximum val-\nues of approximately \u22120.28\u000110\u22124 C m\u22122 K\u22121 at Rmin. An-\nother measure for the performance of NP elastic layers is\nshown in Fig. 10. It demonstrates how much of an alteration\npotential the introduction of NP material has on the second-\nary PY coefficient of PVDF. The reason behind our prefer-\nence for this method of comparison to that utilized in Fig. 9\nis due to the fact that the secondary contribution of PVDF\u2019s\nPY coefficient varies quite significantly from a sample of\nPVDF to another owing largely to their preparation process,\nhence making ample assessment of alternation in secondary\neffect difficult. At Rmin, PVDF-Invar36 pair presents the\ngreatest change of 960% and PVDF-St about 720%, with St\noutperforming both Al and Zn, unlike with other PY materi-\nals. Since the overall PY coefficient is negative while the\nsecondary PY coefficient of PVDF alone under OC is posi-\ntive, both Invar36 and St results in the reduction in the over-\nall PY coefficient\u2019s magnitude. However, with negative per-\ncentile secondary contributions PTFE and CPVC leads to\nenhancement. At Rmin, PVDF-PTFE peaks at \f420% while\nPVDF-CPVC reaches \f450%, both indicating over 300%\nincrease in the secondary PY coefficient of the PVDF com-\nposites, which potentially points to extremely large enhance-\nment in other PVDF samples with greater proportion of sec-\nondary contribution. Figure 11 depicts Faeff behavior of\nPVDF pairs. Only PTFE and CPVC exhibit improvement in\nefficiency while Al and Zn nearly approach Faeff=1 mark,\nwhich St and Invar36 fail to do. At Rmin, maximum Faeff of\n3.4 is attained by PVDF-PTFE, while PVDF-CPVC pair\nreaches 1.8, both indicating significant improvement in effi-\nciency.\nF. Best performing pairs\nIn terms of the pure magnitude of the PY coefficient,\nPZT-5H is the best performing PY material as illustrated in\nFig. 1. PZT-5H-CPVC pair\u2019s huge PY coefficient of 97\n\u000110\u22124 C m\u22122 K\u22121 at Rmin and around 40\u000110\u22124 C m\u22122 K\u22121\nat R=0.022 after which PZT-5H-Zn takes over as the opti-\nmum PY coefficient pair are unrivaled by all of the PY ma-\nterials investigated. As far as Faeff is concerned, PZT-5A-\nPTFE achieves 24, PZT-5H-CPVC 9.4, BTO-CPVC 12, and\nPVDF-PTFE obtains 3.4 at Rmin, while LTO-PTFE and\nLNO-PTFE attain 2.4 and 3.63, respectively, at R=0.025.\nPZT-5A, LTO, and PVDF all fail to register any pair that\nexhibited improvement in the efficiency with Fbeff. However,\nPZT-5H-PTFE reaches Fbeff\n1 at R\n1.0, BTO-PTFE at R\n\n1.1, and LNO-PTFE at R\n0.95.\nIt has to be said that certain assumptions made in the\nthermal expansion coefficients under SC, for example, PZT\nmanufacturer\u2019s data on coefficients of all three axes being\nthe same, which are used to evaluate the thermal expansion\ncoefficients under OC, make the numerical values of our\nsecondary PY coefficients open to discussion.\nIV. SUMMARY\nIn summary, we have developed a mathematical model\nfor the PY effect under OC condition and simulated 2-2 con-\nnectivity enhancement phenomena under such condition for\n36 pairs of PY and NP materials. The investigated PY mate-\nrials are PZT \u0001PZT-5H and PZT-5A\u0002, BTO, LTO, LNO, and\nPVDF, while the NP materials are stainless steel, PTFE \u0001Te-\nflon\u0002, CPVC thermoplastic, aluminum, zinc, and Invar 36.\nOn the whole, in terms of the magnitude of the PY coeffi-\ncient change, Zn outperforms Al\/St and CPVC outperforms\nPTFE in all the pairings with PY materials except PVDF, in\nwhich case it was the opposite due to PVDF\u2019s extremely\nhigh thermal expansion coefficient.

However,\nwhere the figure of merit for efficiency is concerned, this\ndoes not always hold since PTFE and Al possess lower volu-\nmetric heat capacity than CPVC and Zn, respectively. Ex-\ntraordinarily large PY coefficient of 97\u000110\u22124 C m\u22122 K\u22121 at\nRmin is expected for PZT-5H-CPVC while PVDF-CPVC\ncould show increase in the secondary PY coefficient of up to\n350%. In addition, where the figure of merit for efficiency is\nconcerned, for the same volume of the composite PZT-5A-\nPTFE it reaches a 24-fold increase in efficiency, while Fbeff\nindicates in most pairings under OC, it will struggle to\nachieve the same level of efficiency when additional NP ma-\nterials are introduced for PY coefficient alteration.\nIt is clear from our analysis that there indeed is a sub-\nstantial dissimilarity between the PY coefficients and figure\nof merit for efficiency for various PY-NP pairs under SC and\nOC. We believe this implies that there should be a greater\ndistinction made between the PY coefficients under SC and\nOC than previously thought. Our analysis techniques provide\na methodology for assessing the potentials of particular PY\nmaterial and its 2-2 laminates for applications under OC con-\ndition.
