This\npaper extends this basic principle by comparing the health outcomes (measured in terms\nof infant mortality rates) of welfare states and welfare state regimes. It examines whether\nthere are significant differences in health status between the \u2018three worlds of welfare\u2019 and\nto what extent a relationship exists between health and decommodification. It concludes\nby reflecting upon the implications for the \u2018three worlds of welfare\u2019.\nI n t roduct ion\nHow we classify welfare states has long been a concern in social policy (Wilensky\nand Lebaux, 1958; Titmuss, 1974; Therborn, 1987; Esping-Andersen, 1990; Castles and\nMitchell, 1993). Recently, the literature has been dominated by Esping-Andersen\u2019s \u2018three\nworlds of welfare\u2019 typology and the intensive academic debate that has surrounded it\n(Esping-Andersen, 1990; 1999; Lewis, 1992; Leibfreid, 1992; Castles and Mitchell, 1993;\nOrloff, 1993; Borchost, 1994; Daly, 1994; Kangas, 1994; Ragin, 1994; Ferrera, 1996;\nShalev, 1996; Bonoli, 1997; Albrahamson, 1999; Goodin et al., 1999; Sainsbury, 1999;\nPitruzzello, 1999; Arts and Gelissen, 2002; Kasza, 2002; Bambra, 2004a; 2004b; 2005a,\n2005b, 2006).\nIn The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism (1990: 52), Esping-Andersen presents\na decommodification typology of welfare states: Liberal, Conservative, and Social\nDemocratic. In the welfare states of the liberal regime (UK, USA, Ireland, Canada,\nAustralia), state provision of welfare is minimal, benefits are modest and often attract\nstrict entitlement criteria; and recipients are usually means-tested and stigmatised\n(Esping-Andersen, 1990: 26). The conservative welfare state regime (Germany, France,\nAustria, Belgium, Italy and, to a lesser extent, the Netherlands) is distinguished by its\n\u2018status differentiating\u2019 welfare programmes in which benefits are often earnings related,\nadministered through the employer; and geared towards maintaining existing social\npatterns. Provision in the \u2018third world of welfare\u2019, the social democratic (Nordic countries),\nis characterised by universal and comparatively generous benefits, a commitment to full\nemployment and income protection; and a strongly interventionist state (1990: 28).\nFive substantive critiques of this typology have emerged: the range of countries and\nnumber of regime types; the methodology used; the usefulness of the regime concept;\nthe analytical dominance of income maintenance schemes over welfare services; and the\nomission of gender in the analysis. Leibfreid (1992), Ferrera (1996) and Bonoli (1997)\nassert that a distinctive fourth type of welfare state regime is emerging in the countries of\nthe Latin rim of the European Union (Spain, Portugal, Greece and to a lesser extent Italy)\n53\nClare Bambra\nand Castles and Mitchell (1993) argue that the UK, Australia and New Zealand constitute\nanother \u2018radical\u2019 fourth type of welfare state regime (Castles and Mitchell, 1993: 107).\nEsping-Andersen\u2019s methodology has been widely critiqued (Kangas, 1994; Ragin, 1994;\nShalev, 1996; Fawcett and Papadopoulos, 1997; Pitruzzello, 1999; Bambra, 2006) and the\nuse of cluster analysis has also suggested that there could be four or five \u2018worlds of welfare\u2019\n(Pitruzello, 1999: 23\u201350). Kasza (2002) has questioned the validity of the regimes concept\nitself, asserting that instead of internal policy homogeneity or cohesion, welfare states and\nwelfare regimes exhibit significant variation across different areas of provision. Esping-\nAndersen\u2019s decision to organise the principle of classification around the study of cash\nbenefit programs, ignoring the fact that welfare states are also about the actual delivery\nof services, has also been a source of contention (Abrahamson, 1999; Kautto, 2002).\nFeminist commentators (such as Lewis, 1992; Borchost, 1994; Daly, 1994; Sainsbury,\n1994, 1999), have offered the most extensive critique, arguing that Esping-Andersen\u2019s\n\u2018three worlds of welfare\u2019 typology is deeply flawed because it marginalises women.\nWhat is relatively undisputed though in this highly charged and prominent debate,\nis what is arguably the most substantial theoretical and empirical addition made by the\n\u2018three worlds of welfare\u2019 thesis to the welfare state modelling business \u2013 that comparisons\nshould examine what welfare states actually do rather than how much they are afforded\nor which types of services they provide (Esping-Andersen, 1990: 2). However, instead of\ntaking the principle of judging welfare states in terms of outputs rather than inputs, the\ncomparative social policy literature has become bogged down in a \u2018settling of accounts\nwith Esping-Andersen\u2019 (Pierson, 1998: 175). This paper attempts to refocus comparative\nsocial policy research by resurrecting and extending the basic principle that welfare\nstates should be judged on what they do, through an empirical comparison of the health\noutcomes of welfare state regimes.\nEsping-Andersen\u2019s thesis examined what welfare states do in terms of labour market\ndecommodification, and other typologies have extended this principle by examining\nlevels of income inequality (Korpi and Palmer, 1998), the decommodification of key\nwelfare services (Bambra, 2005a, 2005b), or levels of defamilisation (Lewis, 1992;\nOrloff, 1993; Sainsbury, 1999; Korpi, 2000; Bambra, 2004a). Health, however, aside\nfrom the provision of health care services (Bambra, 2005a, 2005b), has been a notable\nomission from both the debate about the \u2018three worlds of welfare\u2019 and the wider welfare\nstate modelling literature. This is very surprising, as it can also be used as a universal\noutcome indicator by which to judge, compare and categorise countries\u2019, or regimes\u2019,\nentire welfare state packages (Coburn, 2004). Health status, especially inequalities in\nhealth within and between Western countries, is largely considered to be determined\nby income inequalities, the distribution of wealth, and other aspects of social and class\ninequalities (Townsend et al. 1992; Wilkinson, 1996; Kawachi et al., 1997; Mackenbach\net al., 1997; Acheson et al., 1998). Welfare provision in its entirety (cash benefits and\nservices) is designed to address these issues of inequality and should therefore have a\nbearing upon health outcomes (Bartley and Blane, 1997; Conley and Springer, 2001;\nDoran and Whitehead, 2003; Navarro et al., 2003; Raphael and Bryant, 2004; Coburn,\n2004).\nEsping-Andersen\u2019s operationalisation of the concept of decommodification is in many\nways a proxy measure of the overall welfare state provision provided by a country\n(although it only examines income maintenance programmes). Essentially, labour market\ndecommodification relates to \u2018the extent to which individuals and families can maintain a\n54\nHealth Status and the Worlds of Welfare\n Welfare state\n Decommodification\nClass and  Health\nMarket income  status\ninequalities\nFigure 1. Decommodification and health status.\nnormal and socially acceptable standard of living regardless of their market performance\u2019\n(Esping-Andersen, 1987: 86). Commodification, in contrast, refers to the extent to which\nworkers and their families are reliant upon the market sale of their labour. The welfare state\ndecommodified labour because certain services and a certain standard of living became\na right of citizenship and reliance on the market for survival decreased (Esping-Andersen,\n1990: 22).\nIn this way, welfare states, through their decommodifying effects, mediate the extent,\nand impact, of market derived class and income inequalities within a country (see\nFigure 1). Therefore, the decommodification provided by welfare states can be considered\nas a social determinant of health and can be expected to have an indirect relationship\nwith health status (Raphael and Bryant, 2003): Countries with a highly decommodifying\nwelfare state package will have less stark class and income inequalities (Esping-Andersen,\n1990; 1999) and therefore better national health outcomes (Wilkinson, 1996) than those\ncountries that operate a less decommodifying system (Coburn, 2004).\nTwo interrelated hypotheses develop from this discussion:\n(i) A relationship, albeit indirect, exists between labour market decommodification and\nhealth status.\n(ii) Labour market decommodification varies between welfare states and so their health\nstatus will also differ.\nThis paper compares how health status varies in 18 different welfare states in order to\ntest these hypotheses and examine the wider implications for the \u2018three worlds of welfare\u2019\ntypology.\nMethods\nLabour market decommodification scores by country were taken from the decom-\nmodification indexes of Esping-Andersen (1990) and Bambra (2004b, 2005b). These\nindexes were based on the assessment of three income maintenance programmes:\npensions, unemployment, and sickness. The process of scoring for each of the three\nprogrammes was by way of the numerical description of the relationship of an individual\ncountry\u2019s score to the mean (and standard deviation) for four of the five factors that make\nup each index. This score was weighted by a fifth factor \u2013 the population covered by the\n55\nClare Bambra\nprogram. Finally, the results of these three separate indexes, pensions, unemployment and\nsickness, were combined to give the overall decommodification score for each country.\nComprehensive details of the scoring procedures are contained in Esping-Andersen (1990)\nand Bambra (2004b, 2005b).\nThe decommodification data were compared with infant mortality rates (IMR). IMR\n(deaths of babies under one year of age per 1000 live births) is a widely used comparative\nindicator of population health (Murray et al., 2000; Conley and Springer, 2001; Navarro\net al., 2003; OECD, 2003; Reidpath and Allotey, 2003). It is considered as a highly\nsensitive measure because of the association between the causes of infant mortality and\nother factors, such as living conditions, social well being, rates of illness and economic\nstatus, that influence the health status of whole populations (Reidpath and Allotey, 2003).\nHowever, it is not without recognised problems (especially outside the countries of the\nWest), not least the variation in how countries classify borderline cases such as barely\nviable foetuses (Howell and Blondell, 1994), or the fact that IMR is calculated from\na small portion of the population (Reidpath and Allotey, 2003). IMRs have therefore\nrecently been supplemented with various other measures of population health, such as\ndisability-adjusted life expectancy \u2013 DALE, or health adjusted life expectancy \u2013 HALE\n(Murray et al., 2000). These newer measures are based on projections of life expectancy,\nadjusted for estimates of ill health or disability (WHO, 2000), and there is considerable\ndebate as to their relative merits (see for example, Murray et al., 2000; WHO, 2000;\nReidpath and Allotey, 2003). Furthermore, data are also only available on these newer\nmeasures for more recent years (post-1995) and so comparability over time is not possible.\nTherefore, as the debate over which of the new health measures is sufficient or better is\nbeyond the remit of this paper, use of the traditional IMR measure, despite its drawbacks,\nwill be maintained and it will be used as a proxy indicative measure of population level\nhealth. Indeed, IMR is strongly correlated (r = 0.91) with DALE (Reidpath and Allotey,\n2003) and with other population level health indicators such as premature death rates\n(WHO, 2000).\nDecommodification data was only available for two separate years, 1980 (Esping-\nAndersen, 1990) and 1998 (Bambra, 2004b, 2005b), and for 18 OECD countries:\nAustralia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,\nJapan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, USA. Data relating\nto IMR were extracted from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\nHealth Database (OECD, 2003) for the corresponding years and the corresponding 18\ncountries. All analysis was carried out using SPSS version 11.\nResu l ts\nTable 1 shows the decommodification scores and IMRs for the individual 18 countries\nand the average decommodification scores and IMRs for each of the three welfare state\nregimes (Liberal, Conservative and Social Democratic). IMRs vary from 6.9 (Sweden) to\n14.6 (Italy) in 1980 and from 3.5 (Sweden) to 7.2 (USA) in 1998. The IMRs of all of the\ncountries decreased dramatically from an overall average of 11.2 in 1980 to an overall\naverage of 5.6 in 1998. The decommodification scores are similarly varied with a range\nof 13 (Australia) to 39.1 (Sweden) in 1980 and from 11.5 (New Zealand) to 34.7 (Sweden)\nin 1998. The overall decommodification scores also moderately decreased between 1980\nand 1998 from 27.2 to 25.7.\n56\nHealth Status and the Worlds of Welfare\nTable 1 IMRs1 and decommodification scores2 in the \u2018three worlds of welfare\u2019, 1980\nand 1998\nInfant mortality rate3 Decommodification\n(deaths per 1000 live births) score\n1980 1998 1980 1998\nLiberal 12.3 6.7 18.8 17.4\nAustralia 10.7 5 13 13.5\nCanada 10.4 5.3 22 27.9\nIreland 11.1 5.9 22.3 22.1\nNew Zealand 13 5.4 17.1 11.5\nUK 12.1 5.7 23.4 15.4\nUSA 12.6 7.2 13.8 14\nConservative 10.5 4.5 29 28.2\nAustria 14.3 4.9 31.1 31.1\nBelgium 12.1 5.6 32.4 31.9\nFrance 10 4.6 27.5 31.5\nGermany 12.6 4.7 27.7 27.7\nItaly 14.6 5.4 24.1 27.6\nJapan 7.5 3.6 27.1 18.3\nNetherlands 8.6 5.2 32.4 28\nSwitzerland 9.1 4.8 29.8 29.7\nSocial democratic 7.6 4.0 36.2 33.1\nDenmark 8.4 4.7 38.1 29\nFinland 7.6 4.2 29.2 34.6\nNorway 8.1 3.9 38.3 34\nSweden 6.9 3.5 39.1 34.7\nNotes: 1 OECD (2003).\n2 Esping-Andersen (1990), Bambra (2004b, 2005b).\n3 Regime rates are population weighted.\nThe Liberal regime had the highest IMR and the lowest labour market\ndecommodification score in both 1980 and 1998 (Table 2). In 1980 the average IMR\nfor the Liberal regime countries was 12.3, this fell to 6.7 in 1998. The Liberal countries\u2019\nIMRs ranged from 10.4 (Canada) to 13 (New Zealand) in 1980 and from 5 (Australia) to\n7.2 (USA) in 1998. The average decommodification score for the Liberal regime countries\nwas 18.8 in 1980 and 17.4 in 1998. Individual labour market decommodification scores\nin the Liberal countries ranged from 13 (Australia) to 23.4 (UK) in 1980 and from 11.5\n(New Zealand) to 27.9 (Canada) in 1998.\nThe Social Democratic regime had the lowest IMR and the highest labour market\ndecommodification score in both 1980 and 1998 (Table 2). In 1980 the average IMR for\nthe Social Democratic countries was 7.6 and in 1998 it was 4.0. The Social democratic\ncountries\u2019 IMRs ranged from 6.9 (Sweden) to 8.4 (Denmark) in 1980 and from 3.5\n(Sweden) to 4.7 (Denmark) in 1998. The Social democratic regime decommodification\nscore was 36.2 in 1980 and 33.1 in 1998. Individual labour market decommodification\nscores in the Social Democratic countries ranged from 29.2 (Finland) to 39.1 (Sweden) in\n1980 and from 29 (Denmark) to 34.7 (Sweden) in 1998.\n57\nClare Bambra\nTable 2 Difference between the \u2018three worlds of welfare\u2019 for IMR and\ndecommodification\nIMR Decommodification\n1980 1998 1980 1998\nSignificance1 0.034 0.045 0.001 0.003\nNote: 1 P value ascertained by Kruskal\u2013Wallis test for independent samples.\nTable 3 Results for correlation1 of IMRs with decommodification\nscores in 18 welfare states, 1980 and 1998\nIMR* decommodification\n1980 1998\nSpearman\u2019s r \u22120.497 \u22120.585\nr2 0.247 0.342\nSignificance 0.005 0.018\nNote: 1 One-tailed bivariate Spearman\u2019s r correlation.\nThe Conservative regime had the median IMR and the median labour market\ndecommodification score in both 1980 and 1998 (Table 2). In 1980 the Conservative\nIMR was 10.5 and this fell to 4.5 in 1998. The Conservative countries\u2019 IMRs ranged\nfrom 7.5 (Japan) to 14.6 (Italy) in 1980 and from 3.6 (Japan) to 5.6 (Belgium) in 1998.\nThe Conservative regime\u2019s decommodification score was 29 in 1980 and 28.2 in 1998.\nIndividual labour market decommodification scores in the Conservative countries ranged\nfrom 24.1 (Italy) to 32.4 (Italy and the Netherlands) in 1980 and from 18.3 (Japan) to 31.9\n(Belgium) in 1998.\nTable 2 shows that these differences between the three welfare state regimes, in\nterms of average IMR and average decommodification score, were statistically significant:\ninfant mortality in the \u2018three worlds of welfare\u2019 differed significantly in 1980 (p < 0.05)\nand 1998 (p < 0.05); and labour market decommodification between the regimes also\nvaried at a significant level in both 1980 (p< 0.005) and 1998 (p< 0.005). Table 3 shows\nthat the relationship between IMRs and decommodification for the individual countries\nand the \u2018three worlds of welfare\u2019 (Liberal regime countries have high mortality and low\ndecommodification, the Social Democratic regime countries have low infant mortality and\nhigh decommodification, and the Conservative regime countries have median mortality\nand median decommodification) is statistically significant in both 1980 (p < 0.005) and\n1998 (p < 0.05): Infant mortality is negatively correlated with decommodification in both\n1980 (\u20130.497) and 1998 (\u20130.585). This suggests that IMR decreases as decommodification\nincreases. Furthermore, the r2 statistic suggests that around 25 per cent in 1980 and\n35 per cent in 1998 of the variability in IMRs is accounted for by variability in labour\nmarket decommodification scores.\n58\nHealth Status and the Worlds of Welfare\nCommenta ry\nEarlier in the paper, two inter-related hypotheses were outlined: (i) that a relationship\nexists between decommodification and health status; and (ii) that as decommodification\nvaries between welfare states so will health status. On the one hand, the results have gone\nsome way to confirm these hypotheses as a significant difference has been demonstrated\nbetween the decommodification scores and IMRs of the \u2018three worlds of welfare\u2019,\nand a moderate strength negative correlation between IMRs and decommodification\nwas also identified. However, on the other hand, the correlation between IMR and\ndecommodification does not mean that it can be concluded that decommodification\ncauses variance in IMR. It is merely one of the various social and economic variables that\nhave an influence on IMR. Indeed, the results suggest that other factors influence IMR,\nas the clear reductions in average IMR over time in all three of the welfare state regimes\nhave been accompanied by moderate decreases in average decommodification scores.\nThese decreases in IMR reflect the common increases in average living standards and\nGDP between 1980 and 1998, and the improvements in medical knowledge and health\nservice technologies (OECD, 2003). Furthermore, whilst IMR varies between different\ntypes of welfare state, it cannot be assumed from research on this one indicator that all\nother indicators of population health status will similarly vary.\nNonetheless, the results do suggest that inequalities in health between countries\nreflect broader differences in their labour market decommodification scores. This is\nperhaps not surprising given the similarities between labour market decommodification\nand other, more widely established, indicators of class and income inequalities that have\nalready been shown to be determinants of health status and international variance in\nhealth (Townsend et al. 1992; Wilkinson, 1996; Kawachi et al., 1997; Mackenbach et al.,\n1997; Acheson et al., 1998). However, more research on how different welfare state\narrangements contribute to health status, perhaps through examining the wider indicators\nof mortality and morbidity, is needed, if we are to more adequately and satisfactorily\nunderstand the complex interactions and use this to inform welfare state modelling.\nThere are also other important implications within the results for the \u2018three worlds of\nwelfare\u2019 thesis and the debate that has emerged in its wake. The results show that welfare\nstates vary in terms of an outcome other than labour market decommodification and\nthat furthermore, labour market decommodification correlates with another important\nwelfare state outcome. The results have also shown that not only does health status, in the\nform of infant mortality rates, vary across individual welfare states but that it also differs\nsignificantly between the three types of welfare state regime: the Liberal regimes have high\ninfant mortality and low decommodification, the Social Democratic regime countries\nhave low infant mortality and high decommodification, and the Conservative regime\ncountries have median infant mortality and median decommodification. Furthermore,\nthese differences are consistent across time as the results were significant in both 1980\nand 1998.\nIn light of the results it is perhaps surprising that health status has not been explored\nbefore within the context of welfare state modelling. This is perhaps because much of the\ndebate surrounding Esping-Andersen\u2019s influential typology (Leibfreid, 1992; Castles and\nMitchell, 1993; Ferrera, 1996; Bonoli, 1997; Kangas, 1994; Ragin, 1994; Shalev, 1996;\nPitruzzello, 1999; Kasza, 2002; Alber, 1995; Abrahamson, 1999; Kautto, 2002; Lewis,\n1992; Orloff, 1993; Borchost, 1994; Daly, 1994, O\u2019Connor, 1993; Sainsbury, 1999) has\n59\nClare Bambra\nnot taken its research agenda on comparing and categorising welfare states in terms of\nwhat they actually do any further. The results have confirmed that health status varies\nacross the welfare states of the West (Makenbach, 1999) and therefore that this is another\nimportant way in which what a welfare state actually does can be judged. It also suggests\nthat the debate about Esping-Andersen and welfare state modelling has perhaps focused\ntoo much on the typology itself and not on the principles behind it.\nConc lus ion\nThis paper has returned to the basic principle of the \u2018three worlds of welfare\u2019 \u2013 that welfare\nstates should be judged in terms of what they do rather than how much they spend or\nwhich services they provide. It has examined health status as a welfare state outcome in\n1980 and 1998. It has shown that health status varies across welfare states and that there\nis a significant difference in terms of health (at least in terms of infant mortality rates)\nbetween the \u2018three worlds of welfare\u2019. Furthermore, it has shown that there is a significant\nnegative relationship between health outcomes and labour market decommodification.\nThis suggests that, when judged in terms of outcomes \u2013 what they actually do \u2013 the \u2018three\nworlds of welfare\u2019 differ significantly from one another.\nRefe rences\nAbrahamson, P.
