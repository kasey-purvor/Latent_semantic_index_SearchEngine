In terms of male facial attractiveness, a \ngreat deal of research has focussed on facial masculinity.  Masculinity has been assumed to be of \nbenefit to women because of its putative association with heritable immunity (i.e. good genes; \nknown as the immunocompetence hypothesis), but also is believed to be associated with potential \ncosts in terms of poor suitability as a long term partner (see e.g. Perrett et al, 1998; Penton-Voak et \nal, 1999; Thornhill & Gangestad, 1999).   \n Boothroyd et al (2005) found that preferences for masculinity in male faces constructed using an \nidentical methodology to that used in previous masculinity studies (Perrett et al, 1998; Penton-Voak \net al, 1999; Little, Burt, Penton-Voak & Perrett, 2001), did not relate to preferences for apparent \nfacial health.  Similarly, Rhodes, Chan, Zebrowitz & Simmons (2003) found that although \nperceptions of masculinity and health related to each other in black and white male facial \nphotographs, the relationship was independent of how attractive observers found the faces.  Such \nresults suggest that women do not necessarily select masculine faces on the basis of health cues and \ncast doubt on whether previous findings using similar stimuli (e.g. investigations of the effects of \nmenstrual cycle, relationship status and own attractiveness on masculinity preference) can be \nexplained by facial masculinity acting as a cue to men\u2019s heritable immunocompetence.  Boothroyd et \nal (2005) suggested instead that it may be beneficial to consider other personality and behavioural \naspects of masculinity (e.g. dominance, investment).   \n There has been a limited amount of research into the behavior and personality traits perceived to \nbe associated with masculinity.  Perrett et al (1998) found in both Caucasian and Japanese samples \nthat masculinized male and female faces were perceived as more dominant, but less warm, \nemotional, honest and cooperative, and as poorer quality parents than average or feminized faces.  \nSimilarly, Johnston, Hagel, Franklin, Fink & Grammer (2001) found that increasing masculinity \n 4\nincreased perceptions of antisocial traits, while increasing femininity increased perceptions of \nprosocial traits.  Moreover, both Swaddle & Reirson (2002) and DeBruine et al (2006) have found \nthat increased masculinity (using a variety of methods in DeBruine et al\u2019s case) is associated with an \nincrease in perceived dominance.  These findings suggest that masculine faces signal dominance, but \nalso a less pleasant personality, and lower suitability as a long term partner and parent.  \n There has also been research into the traits perceived to be related to facial maturity and \nneoteny\/babyfacedness.  Berry & McArthur (1985; see also McArthur & Apatow, 1984) found that \nneotenous faces were perceived as warmer, kinder, more honest and more na\u00efve than mature faces.  \nKeating, Mazur & Segall (1981) also found that sexually mature faces of both sexes were perceived \nas more dominant, stronger and higher status than less sexually mature faces. \n There has been very little attention paid to how perceptions of personality traits relate to apparent \nhealth of faces.  This is surprising given that apparent health is an important determinant of \nattractiveness (e.g. Jones, Perrett et al, 2005). As attractiveness has long been known to create a halo \neffect (e.g. Dion, Berscheid & Walster, 1972), we may expect healthy looking faces to be ascribed a \nvariety of positive traits.  Indeed, attribution of negative personality characteristics to unhealthy \nindividuals may be a proximate mechanism for increasing aversion to individuals who may be more \nlikely to pass on diseases or parasites. \n \n The current research investigated how facial masculinity, apparent healthiness and age are \nrelated to attributions of characteristics that are important in potential partners.  Based on previous \nfindings, it was predicted that masculine faces would be perceived as more dominant, and therefore \nhaving more resources, than feminine faces, but would also be perceived as less likely to commit to \nand remain faithful in a relationship, \u2019colder\u2019 and as poorer parents.  Younger faces can be predicted \nto look warmer than older faces, while older faces (which tend to look more masculine; Boothroyd et \nal, 2005) may be perceived as more dominant, but less faithful and committed than younger faces.  \nWe would expect healthy faces to be rated more positively on all desirable traits if there is an \n 5\nattractiveness halo effect of high apparent health.  It is not clear, however, how healthiness will \naffect perceptions of personality once the attractiveness halo effect is controlled for (see Study 2).  \n \nStudy 1 \n \nStudy 1 was an experimental design which assessed how manipulations of facial characteristics \naffected perceptions of personality traits. \n \nRaters \nParticipants were recruited via an opportunity sample of those passing through the laboratory \nwebsite.  94 males and 76 females judged the Set A male faces.  96 males and 69 females judged the \nSet B male faces.  Mean age was 29.4 years (SD=8.00). \n \nStimuli \nStudy 1 used two stimulus sets previously developed by Boothroyd et al (2005); employment of two \nstimulus sets allows replication across independent images.  Set A faces consisted of 3 male \ncomposite faces (each composite was created from between 12 and 66 facial photographs; mean age \nof composites being 21.2 to 22.0 years) to which a series of \u2018transformations\u2019 were applied \n(Rowland & Perrett, 1995).  Computer manipulation was used to increase and decrease (a) \nmasculinity (50% of the average male-female shape difference in either direction), (b) apparent \nhealth (based on composites of the most and least apparently healthy individuals within a cohort), \nand (c) apparent age in each face (based on composites of older and younger faces; mean perceived \nage gap=2.16 years).  This created 9 pairs of faces (masculinized and feminized; unhealthy, and \nhealthy; older and younger; for each of the 3 original faces).  Set B faces consisted of 18 male \ncomposite faces (each created from 10 facial photographs; mean age for all composites 21.0 years).  \n6 were transformed on masculinity, 6 were transformed on health, and 6 were transformed on age \n(mean perceived age gap=2.28 years), to create 18 pairs of faces in total. \n 6\n \nProcedure \nParticipants completed the experiment via a web-based test.  Stimulus pairs were presented side by \nside in a java applet, with a 0-7 scale underneath (see Boothroyd et al, 2005, for further details of \napplet).  Participants were asked to select which face was \u201cmore [of the trait] and how much more \nso\u201d by clicking on a point on the scale (where 0=strong choice for face on the left, 7=strong choice \nfor face on the right and 3.5 is the theoretical indifference point).  Traits selected for judgement were \nthree relating to dominance and resources (dominance, ambition and wealth), three relating to long \nterm partner\/father suitability (faithfulness, commitment and parenting) and warmth, a key central \npersonality trait (following Asch, 1946).  The precise phrasing was as follows; Which face is: \n\u2022 the most ambitious?  \n\u2022 the most likely to be committed to a long term partner? Would they stay with their partner if \nthey had one? \n\u2022 the most dominant? Someone who is socially dominant is able to strongly influence others \nand is someone others defer to. \n\u2022 the most likely to be faithful to a long term partner? \n\u2022 the better parent? If they were raising your children or your nieces\/nephews, do you think \nthey would do a good job? \n\u2022 the warmest? \n\u2022 the most wealthy? How much money do you think they have or are likely to earn? \nParticipants were presented with 7 randomly ordered blocks of trials: one for each personality trait.  \nWithin each block, stimulus pairs were presented in a random order.   \n \nResults \n Within each set of results, ratings for the 3 or 6 face pairs were collapsed for each trait rating.  \nEach subject\u2019s ratings were compared using Wilcoxon tests against a dummy variable in which all \nparticipants were assigned a score of 3.5, representing the indifference point where neither face was \n 7\nselected.  Following statistical correction for multiple comparisons (Holm, 1979) there were no \nsignificant differences between the ratings of men and women for either stimulus set (prior to \ncorrection, each set had three significant results out of 21 comparisons, and men and women differed \nin extremity of decision, not direction); therefore male and female data was analysed together.  All \nsignificant and marginal results are given here, and Wilcoxon statistics are given as a z-score of U, \nalong with d score effect sizes.  Results with p>0.1 (2 tailed) are omitted.  N for Set A tests was 170; \nN for set B tests was 165. \n \n  Set A faces  Masculine male faces were rated as significantly, more dominant (z=6.28, \np<0.001, d=1.10), less faithful (z=4.39, p<0.001, d=0.72) and less warm (z=5.21, p<0.001, d=0.31) \nthan feminine male faces.  They were also rated as worse parents (z=2.02, p=0.04) but this became \nnonsignificant once Holm\u2019s correction was applied (adjusted alpha=0.013). \n Older faces were rated as significantly more ambitious (z=3.08, p<0.01, d=0.49), more \ncommitted (z=3.00, p<0.01, d=0.47), more dominant (z=7.56, p<0.001, d=1.42), better parents \n(z=2.86, p<0.01, d=0.45), and wealthier (z=4.69, p<0.001, d=0.77) than younger male faces.  They \nwere also rated as less warm (z=2.09, p=0.04) but this became nonsignificant following Holm\u2019s \ncorrection (adjusted alpha=0.025). \n Healthy male faces were rated as significantly more ambitious (z=6.96, p<0.001, d=1.26), more \ncommitted (z=5.43, p<0.001, d=0.92), more dominant (z=4.78, p<0.001, d=0.79), more faithful \n(z=5.77, p<0.001, d=0.99), better parents (z=7.59, p<0.001, d=1.43), warmer (z=8.04, p<0.001, \nd=1.57) and wealthier (z=7.11, p<0.001, d=1.30) than unhealthy male faces. \n \n  Set B faces  Masculine male faces were rated as significantly more dominant (z=4.71, \np<0.001, d=0.79), less faithful (z=6.74, p<0.001, d=1.23), worse parents (z=6.74, p<0.001, d=1.23), \nless warm (z=7.11, p<0.001, d=1.33) and less wealthy (z=2.49, p<0.05, d=0.4) than feminine male \nfaces.  They were also rated as less committed (z=2.17, p=0.03) but this became nonsignificant \nfollowing Holm\u2019s correction (adjusted alpha=0.017). \n 8\n Older male faces were rated as significantly more ambitious (z=6.43, p=0.001, d=1.16), more \ncommitted (z=4.09, p<0.001, d=0.67), more dominant (z=6.41, p<0.001, d=1.15), more faithful \n(z=4.82, p<0.001, d=0.81), better parents (z=6.78, p<0.001, d=1.24), warmer (z=5.71, p<0.001, \nd=0.99) and wealthier (z=5.96, p<0.001, d=1.05) than younger male faces.  \n Healthy male faces were rated as significantly more ambitious (z=6.46, p<0.001, d=1.16), more \ncommitted (z=6.09, p<0.001, d=1.08), more dominant (z=3.00, p<0.01, d=0.48), more faithful \n(z=6.36, p<0.001, d=1.14), better parents (z=9.45, p=0.001, d=2.17), warmer (z=9.22, p<0.001, \nd=2.06) and wealthier (z=8.37, p<0.001, d=1.72) than unhealthy male faces. \n   \nStudy 2 \n \nStudy 1 clearly showed differences between the characteristics attributed to masculine faces and \nhealthy faces. The perceptual link between facial health and all traits may simply reflect an \nattractiveness halo effect, given that apparent health and attractiveness of faces are positively related \n(e.g. Jones, Perrett, et al., 2005).  Therefore, the purpose of Study 2 was to investigate the links \nbetween facial appearance and personality while controlling for attractiveness.  A correlational \ndesign was utilized which allowed for partial correlation analyses.  Furthermore, a third stimulus set \nwas used (Set C) which consisted of individual male facial photographs. \n \nStimuli \nStudy 2 also used two sets of stimuli: Set B, as used in Study 1, and Set C which consisted of facial \nphotographs of 58 male St Andrews University students (mean age=21.3 years, SD=3.2) \nphotographed under standardized lighting conditions.  For presentation purposes, the Set C stimuli \nwere aligned to match on pupil location and cropped to show face and hair only. \n \nRaters \n 9\n15 women and 12 men (mean age=21.9 years, SD=2.4) rated the Set B images for their personality \ntraits, apparent age, health and masculinity, while 19 women and 13 men (mean age=26.4 years, \nSD=7.0) independently rated the Set B images for attractiveness.  All Set B raters were \nundergraduates and postgraduates at St Andrews University.  Set C faces were rated by 10 women \nand 8 men (mean age=28.4 years, SD=8.9) who were recruited through staff and students at Durham \nUniversity. \n \nProcedure \nRaters were given separate blocks of trials (one each for the seven personality traits, plus \nmasculinity, healthiness, apparent age and attractiveness) in a random order, except for those who \nrated the Set B faces for attractiveness who were given only one block of trials.  For the trait and \nphysical appearance ratings, participants were asked to rate from 1-7 the extent to which that face \nexhibited the trait concerned, while for apparent age, participants were asked to estimate the age of \nthe face.  Order of stimuli within each ratings block was randomized.  Participation was conducted in \nthe laboratory on identical computers.  Data were averaged together by stimulus such that each face \nin each stimulus set had a mean score for each perceptual characteristic.  Inter-rater agreement was \nacceptable to excellent (Cronbach\u2019s alphas range: 0.65 to 0.92) except for ratings of commitment \nand faithfulness in Stimulus Set B where agreement was very low (alphas below 0.2); ratings for \ncommitment and faithfulness for Set B should therefore be treated with caution. \n \nResults \nSet B faces  The Set B ratings of physical appearance were validated by comparing the \nperceived masculinity, health and age of the respective face pairs.  As found by Boothroyd et al \n(2005), masculinized faces were perceived as significantly more masculine looking than feminized \nfaces (t10=2.44, p<0.05, d=1.54); \u2018healthy\u2019 faces appeared more healthy than \u2018unhealthy\u2019 faces \n(t10=4.35, p=0.001, d=2.75); and \u2018older\u2019 faces were estimated as being older than \u2018younger\u2019 faces \n(t10=3.19, p=0.01, d=2.02). \n 10\n Due to the nature of the data (one score per characteristic, per face), the problems of multiple \ntests were avoided by entering the faces\u2019 scores for the seven personality traits into a principal \ncomponents analysis, thus reducing the number of variables (eigenvalues below 1 and correlation \ncoefficients below 0.4 were suppressed during the analysis; see Table 1 for zero-order correlations).  \nOnly two factors emerged; as seen in Table 2, Factor 1 consists of all the traits save dominance; as \nsuch, it can possibly be characterized as general desirability.  Contrastingly, ambition and dominance \nload positively onto Factor 2, while commitment and faithfulness load negatively; Factor 2 can \ntherefore be seen as indicating \u2018alpha male\u2019 type characteristics (social dominance, and lack of \ninterest in long term relationships). \n TABLES 1& 2 ABOUT HERE  \n Perceived healthiness and attractiveness of the faces correlated positively with Factor 1 \n(r36=0.907 and r36=0.822 respectively, both p<0.001) such that the more attractive or healthy a face, \nthe more it was perceived as displaying desirable characteristics, while perceived masculinity and \nage correlated positively with Factor 2 (r36=0.601, p<0.001; r36=0.508, p<0.01 respectively) such \nthat more masculine and older faces were perceived as having more \u2018alpha\u2019 traits and less likely to \nbe a faithful and committed partner.  There were no other significant correlations (see Table 3 for \ndetails).  Importantly, the relationship between rated health and Factor 1 scores remained strong even \nafter attractiveness was controlled for (r33=0.697, p<0.001; all other correlations, or lack of, also \nremained; see Table 3 for details), indicating that the tendency to ascribe positive characteristics to \nhealthy faces could not be explained solely by an attractiveness halo effect.  Similarly, partialling \napparent age out of the masculinity correlations and vice versa did not affect the results. \nTABLE 3 ABOUT HERE  \n \nSet C faces Principal components analysis of the 7 personality ratings revealed two factors \nwhich were strikingly similar to the factors for Set B (see Table 2).  Factor 1 consisted of all traits, \nall loading positively (whereas for Set B, dominance was not included in Factor 1) and can therefore \nagain be characterized as general desirability as a partner.  Factor 2 was almost an exact repeat of \nFactor 2 for Set B and can again be interpreted as indicating alpha male traits.   \n 11\n Attractiveness, perceived healthiness and perceived age of the faces all correlated positively with \nFactor 1 (r58=0.700, p<0.001; r58=0.710, p<0.001; and r58=0.278, p<0.05, respectively) such that the \nmore attractive, healthier or older a face, the more it was perceived as displaying socially desirable \ncharacteristics.   Perceived attractiveness, masculinity and age correlated with Factor 2 (r58=0.296, \np<0.05; r58=0.552, p<0.001; and r58=0.412, p\u22640.001, respectively) such that more attractive, and \nparticularly more masculine and older faces, were perceived as having more \u2018alpha\u2019 traits and less \nlikely to be a faithful and committed partner.  As before, the relationship between rated health and \nFactor 1 scores remained after attractiveness was controlled for (r55=0.292, p<0.05).  The correlation \nhere between perceived age and Factor 1, which had been absent in the data for Stimulus Set B, \ndisappeared once attractiveness was controlled for, leaving a pattern of results which matched the \npartial correlations for Set B (see Table 3 for details); however, further controlling for perceived \nmasculinity restored the correlation between apparent age and Factor 1 (r58=0.316, p<0.05), and \nremoved the correlation between apparent age and factor 2 (r58=-0.081).  Controlling for apparent \nage did not affect the masculinity correlations.  \nTABLE 4 ABOUT HERE  \n \nDiscussion \nOverall results \n The results of both studies are summarized in Table 4 above.  In general, increased apparent \nhealth was linked with an increase in perceptions of all seven traits (with socially desirable traits \nbeing ascribed to healthy individuals) even after controlling for attractiveness, but was not associated \nwith any dominance\/commitment trade-off in Study 2.  Increased apparent age lead to an increase in \nperceptions of wealth, ambition, commitment, dominance, faithfulness and parenting skill, but had a \nmixed effect on warmth in Study 1 and also (once attractiveness and masculinity were controlled \nfor) on the Study 2 factors.  Increased apparent masculinity was associated with an increase in \u2018alpha \nmale\u2019 traits and a decrease in suitability as a partner in both studies.   \n \nMasculinity \n 12\n As predicted, across both studies male facial masculinity was associated with higher levels of \nperceived dominance, but lower perceptions of commitment and fidelity within a long term \nrelationship.  This supports previous research into masculine vs. feminine faces (see Introduction).  \nIt is also concordant with Perusse\u2019s (1993) behavioral data showing that high status men are less \nlikely to settle into a long term relationship and tend have more sexual partners, and Mazur & \nMichalek\u2019s (1998) data showing a link between testosterone in males and marital problems.  \nApparent facial health, however, was associated with increased attribution of all socially desirable \ntraits and was not linked to \u2018commitment versus dominance\u2019 in Study 2.  These results further \nsupport Boothroyd et al\u2019s (2005) contention that women\u2019s preferences for male facial masculinity do \nnot operate on the same basis as their preferences for an arguably less ambiguous sign of \nimmunocompetence, namely apparent health.   \n These data therefore lend more weight to the hypothesis suggested by Boothroyd et al (2005), \nthat the advantages of masculinity may best be viewed in the context of dominance as a \u2018sexy son\u2019 \ntrait.  Weatherhead & Robertson (1979) use a polygyny threshold model to argue that if a male can \nproduce sons who will go on to have high reproductive success, then females will be more likely to \nengage in polygynous relationships with such a male.  Thus, with this strategy, females may be \nwilling to \u2018sacrifice\u2019 full paternal investment for increased inclusive fitness through their male \noffspring, by selecting a more masculine male partner.  In Western (non-polygamous) society, this \nwillingness to sacrifice paternal investment may be seen as women\u2019s willingness to engage in short \nterm relationships and perhaps long term affairs. \n This concept of masculinity being a \u2018sexy son\u2019 trait can be further tested by assessing whether \nfacial masculinity, dominance, number of potential conceptions (as in Perusse, 1993) and number of \nsons\u2019 potential conceptions are all positively related in men.  Although there is evidence for several \nintercorrelations (e.g. Mueller & Mazur, 1997; Perusse, 1993; Perrett et al, 1998), data that link them \nall together are lacking.  \n \nHealth \n 13\n Healthy faces were perceived as possessing all seven traits significantly more than unhealthy \nfaces in both studies.  Thus healthier faces appeared not only more dominant (which may well have \npositive aspects, such as helping individuals acquire resources), but were also perceived as more \nwealthy, ambitious, faithful, committed, warmer and as better parents, even after controlling for any \npossible attractiveness halo effects in Study 2.  Importantly, healthiness was not related to the \u2018alpha \nmale\u2019 factor in Study 2 which appears to represent a trade-off between dominance and relationship \ninvestment.  This suggests that from a mate-choice perspective, there are no apparent perceived costs \nto choosing a healthy male face (in stark contrast to masculine male faces).  It is therefore far less \nsurprising that when women are making decisions between healthy and unhealthy male faces, they \ncan do so in ways which are strikingly different to the way they make choices between masculine \nand feminine faces (see e.g. Boothroyd et al, 2005; Jones, Little et al, 2005).   \n It is important to consider the potential accuracy of the personality attributions made to healthy \nfaces here.  There is evidence for accuracy in judgements of honesty and cooperativeness from facial \nphotographs (e.g. Berry & Wero, 1993; Bond, Berry, & Omar, 1994; Yamagishi, Tanida, Mashima, \nShimoma & Kanazawa, 2003), however, such research is not extensive and self-other concordance \nin personality judgements at zero-acquaintance is mixed (e.g. Kenny, Albright, Malloy & Kashy, \n1994; but see Penton-Voak et al, 2006) and may in any case result from the self-fulfilling prophecy \n(whereby the stereotype drives the development of the behavior).  There is, however, evidence that \npersonality traits, such as high agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience are \nrelated to better reported health (Korotkov & Hannah, 2004).  Although these personality traits do \nnot directly relate to the traits studied here, it may be fair to loosely equate agreeableness with \nwarmth and to link dominance with extraversion.  In which case, the ratings made by our \nparticipants may well reflect valid perceptions rather than merely stereotypes (although this does not \nprovide any explanation of the causal link between apparent health and personality).    \n \nMaturity \n 14\n Although previous research had shown strong visual similarity between facial age and \nmasculinity (e.g. Boothroyd et al, 2005), these data suggest that the two traits are not necessarily \nperceived as signalling the same partner characteristics; facial age was perceived as pro-social in \nStudy 1 and in Set C in Study 2 once the effects of attractiveness and masculinity were controlled \nfor.  This therefore suggests that there are multiple facets of facial age.  Although older faces may be \nviewed more positively than younger faces (particularly perhaps in this study because the \u2018older\u2019 \nfaces would have been nearer most raters\u2019 own ages than the \u2018younger\u2019 faces), the fact that they look \nmore masculine may sometimes (as seen in the real faces in Study 2) drive an overall perception of \nolder faces being more \u2018alpha male\u2019 than younger faces.  Future research could attempt to further \naddress any interaction between masculinity and maturity in face perception; for instance using \nlongitudinal photograph sets in order to consider how actual aging affects perceptions, versus \nindividual differences in sexual dimorphism. \n \nTrait clusters \n It is important to acknowledge the results of Study 2, in which both sets of raters, using different \nstimulus sets (one set being manipulated facial images, the other being real facial images), produced \nalmost identical factors in a principal components analysis.  In particular, the structure of Factor 2 in \nboth analyses suggests that there is a very strong covariation between dominance and unsuitability as \na partner, as these traits are perceived by observers.  Although the ratings of commitment and \nfaithfulness for Stimulus Set B showed very poor inter-rater agreement, the strong similarity in \nFactor 2 between the two sets allows us to be more confident in the results for Set B.  Further \nresearch could explore the extent to which these two factors (general desirability and \u2018alpha \nmaleness\u2019) are important in explaining variation in attraction to masculinity.  \n \n Finally, it is important to highlight that the faces used in this study were those of undergraduate \nstudents aged between 18 and 22, and may not entirely reflect the role of masculinity, healthiness \nand especially facial maturity in the wider population; further research should address these issues in \n 15\na more generalizable sample of faces. Overall, the research presented here has shown in three \nseparate stimulus sets, using two different methodologies, that male facial masculinity is perceived \nto be associated with traits unsuitable for a long term partner (but still perhaps beneficial for a short \nterm partner because of possible sexy-son effects), while facial health is perceived as indicating \ntraits which make suitable long term partners.  This may go some way to explaining discrepancies in \nfemale preference for health and masculinity (Jones, Little, et al, 2005; Boothroyd et al, 2005).   \n \n \nReferences \n \nAsch, S.E. (1946).
