We explore how \nclinical and research actors, in collaboration with regulatory institutions and \npharmaceutical companies, come to frame these domains as uncertainties and how \nthey re-deploy uncertainty in the 'collective production' of new \ndiagnostic conventions and bioclinical standards. While drawing as a \nbackground on ethnographic, documentary and interview data, the \npaper proposes an in-depth, contextual analysis of the proceedings \nof an international meeting organised by the Peripheral and Central \nNervous System Drug Advisory Committee of the US Food and Drug \nAdministration to discuss whether or not a particular diagnostic \nconvention - Mild Cognitive Impairment or MCI - exists and how \nbest it ought to be studied. Based on this analysis we argue that \nthe deployment of uncertainty is reflexively implicated in bioclinical \ncollectives' search for rules and conventions, and furthermore that \nthe collective production of uncertainty is central to the 'knowledge \nmachinery' of regulatory objectivity. \n \nKeywords: Alzheimer\u2019s Disease; biomedicine; diagnostic convention; mild \ncognitive impairment; uncertainty. \n \n \nIn the last decade, there has been increased interest in the biomolecular and \nepidemiological characterization of pre-clinical dementia. It is argued that early \ndiagnosis of dementia and particularly of Alzheimer\u2018s Disease (AD) will facilitate the \nprevention of dementing processes and lower the prevalence of the condition in the \n  2 \ngeneral population. The search for a diagnostic category or biomarker that would \nserve this purpose is an ongoing endeavour for research and clinical communities. \nThis research, however, has been problematic, leading some commentators to argue \nthat the categories and standards that support the work of clinicians and researchers \n\u2017reveal increasing ambiguity rather than clarity\u2018 (Gaines & Whitehouse, 2006: 62), in \nthat boundaries are becoming less certain than before between normal aging and \ndementia, on the one hand, and different types of dementia -- Vascular dementia, \nLewy-Body dementia or Fronto-temporal dementia-- on the other.  \nIn this paper, we investigate how clinicians and researchers, in collaboration \nwith regulatory institutions and pharmaceutical companies, come to frame these \nuncertainties and re-deploy them in the \u2017collective production\u2018 of new diagnostic \nconventions and bioclinical standards. Our point of departure is that such practices are \nconcerned with a distinctive type of objectivity, regulatory objectivity, that focuses on \nthe establishment of conventions through collectively concerted programs of action \n(Cambrosio et al. 2006). This form of objectivity is particularly suited to the complex, \nnon-linear relationships established between laboratory biology and the clinic in \ncontemporary medicine, in which hybrid bio-clinical entities are set up to mediate the \nrelationship between those settings (Keating & Cambrosio, 2003).  In this context, the \nestablishment of conventional standard and systems of regulation are viewed as  \nendogenous requirements for ongoing knowledge production, innovation and clinical \nwork rather than forms of external control. Here, we offer a detailed view of the \ncollective, reflexive work that is entailed in making such conventions.  \nThe paper focuses on one such conventional standard: Mild Cognitive \nImpairment (MCI).  MCI is a concept originally coined by the American neurologist \nRonald Petersen to describe a transitional stage between normal cognitive aging and \ndementia (Petersen et al. 1999; Petersen, 2003). Our interest in it is that it was also \nexplicitly devised as an attempt to bridge  emerging biomolecular models of \nAlzheimer\u2018s disease progression with secondary prevention therapies being devised in \nlaboratories at the turn of the 21\nst\n century and the perceived increase in the \npresentation of \u2017mild memory problems\u2018 in the clinic around the same period \n(Petersen et al, 2001). According to this view, MCI was to bring together the \nlaboratory and the clinic into one common ground of understanding Alzheimer\u2018s \ndisease. That this view was not generally and immediately accepted in the field of \ndementia research, practice and policy provide us with the opportunity to analyse an \n  3 \naspect of regulatory objectivity that has remained hitherto unexplored: how are \nconventional standards put together. In the paper, we explore the processes through \nwhich conventional standards are proposed, criticised, evaluated and re-configured to \nserve the purpose of a diverse and changing configurations of actors and settings. \nWhile drawing on ethnographic, documentary and interview data documenting the \nscientific, clinical and political controversy around MCI,\ni\n the paper analyses one \nsingle turning point in this process: the proceedings of an international meeting about \nMCI organised by the Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drug Advisory \nCommittee of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2001 (Food and Drug \nAdministration, 2001). The policies and agenda laid at this meeting came to shape \nmost of the subsequent basic, clinical and therapeutic research in this area as well as \nthe clinical guidelines and consensus groups held on MCI to this day (Petersen et al. \n2001; Winblad et al. 2004; Gauthier et al. 2006). Furthermore, in this meeting, for the \nfirst time in its history, the FDA asked one of its committees \u2017to address some \nfundamental aspects of a particular diagnosis \u2026, and decide if it exists and how best it \nought to be studied\u2018 (Food and Drug Administration 2001), rather than considering a \nlicensing application for a specific drug. As such, this meeting constitutes an \nimportant resource not only to understand the history of MCI as a conventional \nbioclinical entity, but more importantly to examine regulatory objectivity in action. \nThe main finding of this analysis is that actors\u2018 assessments of \u2017evidence\u2018 and \nreflexive engagement with conventional aspects of their practice, which Cambrosio \nand colleagues consider central to regulatory objectivity, are both embedded in an \nongoing \u2017collective production of uncertainty\u2018. We argue that uncertainty should be \nunderstood not merely as the \u2017context of\u2018 bioclinical collectives\u2018 search for rules and \nconventions but also as an achievement endogenous to -- and essential for -- the \ndynamics of those collectives (Bourret & Rabeharisoa, 2008).\nii\n From this perspective, \nuncertainty is not a socio-cognitive ambivalence experienced by individuals in \ncomplex decision-making situations (Fox, 1959; Fox, 2000) Our empirical focus is on \nthe practical accomplishment of uncertainty, on two levels. First, we are interested in \nuncertainty as a way of framing the organisation of knowledge production, \ntechnological development and policy formulation in domains characterised by \ncontroversy and indeterminacy (Callon, 1998). In the first section of this paper, we \ndescribe how epistemic, technological and political changes in the field of AD worked \ntogether to unsettle the relations between laboratories, clinics, and regulatory and \n  4 \npolicy institutions established at the end of the 1970\u2018s. We will then suggest that the \nemergence of prodromal dementia categories, such as MCI, can be seen as attempts to \nwane the proliferation of uncertainties in this domain\niii\n, and that, in this respect, the \nFDA 2001 MCI meeting represents a key collective effort to frame this process. This \nlast point relates to our second understanding of uncertainty as a discursive, \ninteractive accomplishment. Here, we draw from Lynch\u2018s (1998) homology between \nthe lines of interrogation of evidence deployed by lawyers in the OJ Simpson 1994-95 \ntrial and the modes of enquiry employed by academic STS. His analysis of lawyers\u2018 \n\u2017deconstructive\u2018 investigations of forensic DNA profiling as a sociology of \nknowledge machine provides an insight into the power of settings such as courts in \ntransforming ands unsettling stable socio-technical arrangements. But while Lynch\u2018s \ninvestigation was anchored on STS\u2018 conceptual opposition between stability and \nuncertainty, our focus was on how participants in the FDA meeting collaboratively \nexposed the uncertainties and the historical contingencies of the conventions that \nsupport their activities at one particular time in order to construct another explicitly \ncontingent category. In the main section of the paper, we examine how this was \nachieved by a) predicating the exploration of uncertainties about MCI upon the \ndefinition of the political boundaries for the collective, b) redistributing uncertainty to \nadjacent domains, and c) drawing from this extended uncertainty to formulate a policy \nof articulation between research and clinical practice based on the transience of MCI \nas a category. Through these procedures, actors invested an uncertain and transient \nconventional category with the power to mediate and organise the exploration of \nindeterminacies and ambiguities about dementia and its treatment. We suggest that the \ncollective production of uncertainty should be seen not as the reverse but as \nconstituent to the temporary stabilisation of biomedicine\u2018s knowledge and entities in \nthe clinic, laboratory and regulatory fora. In these types of setting, STS\u2018 lines of \nenquiry might be more useful than they have been in the courts (Lynch and Cole, \n2005)   \n \nBioclinical Uncertainty in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Related Dementias \nIn the historiography of Alzheimer\u2018s disease (Ballenger, 2006), it is generally \naccepted that the re-awakening of interest in senile dementia in the 1960\u2018s was \nsparked by the publication of studies led by Martin Roth and colleagues at Newcastle \n  5 \n(UK), which correlated the number of neuritic plaques in patients\u2018 brains with the \nscores obtained by those patients in cognitive tests  (Roth et al. 1966). Developments \nin electron microscopy in the early 1960\u2018s had fostered a re-description of the \nneuropathological features of dementia at the ultra-structural level (Kidd, 1963; Terry, \n1963) and this created interest in neurobiology among neuropathologists. This interest \nreshaped Alzheimer\u2018s disease during the 1970\u2018s, and was the basis for a number of \netiological theories that were proposed in that decade, the most important of which \naddressed the possibility of a scrapie-like virus, toxic effects of aluminium in the \nbrain and a deficit of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This last hypothesis, \nsupported by neurochemistry studies that linked the cholinergic system in the brain \nand the cognitive deficits observed in patients suspected to have Alzheimer\u2018s disease, \nbecame the focus of a considerable proportion of the Alzheimer\u2018s disease research in \nthe late 1970\u2018s and early 1980\u2018s (Davies & Maloney, 1976; Perry et al. 1977; \nWhitehouse et al. 1982).  \nThese advances in the understanding of the biology of the disease were \naccompanied by an intensive process of characterization of the disease processes from \na clinical\/behavioural perspective. Already in synchrony with the Newcastle \ncorrelation studies, Blessed, Tomlinson and Roth had developed an informant-based \ninstrument to assess memory, concentration and orientation (Ballenger, 2006). This \nwas followed by a series of tools aiming to measure mental status, such as the Mini \nMental Status Exam (Folstein et al. 1975), tests concerned with \u2017clinically observable \ndeterioration\u2018 such as Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) (Flicker et al., 1991), and \nothers aimed at assessing behavioural changes, or cognitive performance. The \nmultiplication of instruments, the establishment of the Alzheimer\u2018s Disease Research \nCentres in the US and, in part energized by these new centres, the perceived increase \nin demand for dementia care, created the context for a consensus conference that set \ncriteria for the clinical diagnosis of AD (McKhann et al. 1984). The establishment of \nthis \u2017conventional standard\u2018 supported clinical diagnoses of AD, which themselves \nembodied a vision of the integration between research, therapeutic experimentation \nand clinical practice (Moreira, in press).             \nThis envisioned coherence was, however, not solely the product of a \nspontaneous self-organising process between research and clinical constituencies. In a \ncrucial way, this coherence had been framed and shaped by the efforts of the National \nInstitute of Aging (NIA), particularly after the nomination of Zaven Khachaturian as \n  6 \nDirector of the Neuroscience and Neuropsychology of Aging Program in 1977, which \nenveloped these constituencies, political actors and the \u2017American public\u2018 within what \nRobert Butler, the founding director of the NIA, called the \u2017health politics of anguish\u2018 \n(Fox 1989). The \u2017politics of anguish\u2018 and the activities of the Alzheimer\u2018s Association \nwere key in the NIA\u2018s efforts to obtain budget increases from the US Congress, as \nwell as its efforts to crystallize a new political understanding of old age and its \nchanging dynamics (Holstein, 2000). In this context, it was possible for this \nbioclinical collective to establish itself in the public arena, with further the assistance \nof expert calculations of the dimension of the \u2017problem of dementia\u2018 in the US \n(Katzman, 1976).  \nThe alignment between the worlds of research, clinical practice, politics and \npatient advocacy that underpinned the emergence of the bioclinical collective for AD \nwas, however, built upon shifting foundations. The same molecular techniques that \nhad first energised AD research in the 1970\u2018s were already, during the 1980\u2018s, \nsuggesting possible alternatives to the \u2017cholinergic hypothesis\u2018; alternatives that were \nlinked to the therapeutic implications of the solubility of amyloid in the neuritic \nplaques found in brains of patient with Alzheimer\u2018s disease (Glenner & Wong, 1984). \nAlso it was becoming clear that expectations, fostered during 1970s and 80s, for a \n\u2017rational\u2018, unproblematic translation of the cholinergic hypothesis into safe \npharmacology were unrealistic. When results of clinical trials of cholinesterase \ninhibitors (ChEIs) started surfacing in the 1990s, the expectations in the clinical \nresearch community had been already significantly lowered (Moreira, in Press). \nDrawing on a genetic model of the pathogenesis of early-onset AD, the bioclinical \ncollective of AD appeared, during the 1990s, to focus its attention and therapeutic \nhopes on what became known as the \u2017amyloid cascade hypothesis\u2018 (Hardy and \nHiggins, 1992). Despite its success, controversy about the validity of the theory \nincreased over the years, as competing theories were proposed that emphasized the \nrole of the tau protein in the formation of axonal \u2017tangles\u2018 (Lovestone & Reynolds, \n1997), upstream oxidative stress (Nunomura et al. 2006), or the dynamics of protein \nfolding.  \nThis multiplication of hypotheses was further compounded by the evolving \nrelationship between different types of dementia. While the definition of AD proposed \nthe during the 1970s relied on its differentiation from the vascular models of dementia \nthat had been popular before (Ballenger, 2006), during the 1990\u2018s new work \n  7 \ndemonstrated that vascular pathologies, notably atherosclerosis, white matter lesions, \nand mid-life arterial hypertension, were associated with AD and could enhance \ncognitive loss (Humpel & Marksteiner, 2005). Furthermore, research on the biology \nof dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson disease dementia, and fronto-temporal \ndementia led to a redefinition of the classification of the dementias. In this \nclassification, AD shared characteristics with both amyloidopathies, such as Familial \nAmyloid Polineuropathy (Corino de Andrade\u2018s Disease), and taupathies, such as \nfronto-temporal dementia, or progressive supranuclear palsy. These trends, it was \nincreasingly realised, could potentially lead to the disaggregation of the \u2017identity\u2018 of \nthe AD and its bioclinical collective. \nThose concerned with the clinical diagnosis and management of AD had to \ndeal with different problems. While the establishment of the \u2017conventional standard\u2018 \nfor the diagnosis of AD (McKhann et al., 1984) and the arrival of ChEIs helped to \nconsolidate and stabilize the category of AD itself, the striving towards reliability and \nconsistency across AD clinics may have produced a paradoxical effect. From the \nbeginning, clinical assessment tools such as the GDS had included milder-than-\ndementia levels of cognitive impairment and seemed to suggest a continuous path in \nthis condition. In fact, a debate about whether AD is qualitatively different from \nnormal aging or quantitatively different along a cognitive continuum had been alive \nsince the 1980\u2018s (Brayne & Calloway, 1988; Anonymous, 1989). The introduction of \nstandardized criteria for the diagnosis of AD in 1984, however, excluded persons \npresenting with \u2017mild memory problems\u2018. Thus, in the next ten years there was a \nmultiplication of terms to categorise the \u2017forgetfulness\u2018 experienced by a growing \nnumber of patients perhaps affected by increased public awareness of the cognitive \nsymptoms of AD: Age Associated Memory Impairment (Crook & Larrabee, 1988); \nMild Cognitive Impairment (Flicker et al. 1991), Age Related Cognitive Decline; Age \nAssociated Cognitive Decline and Cognitive Impairment, No Dementia.  \nAnother consequence of the establishment of standardised diagnostic criteria \nfor AD was the emergence of fractures within the space of representation for \ndementia. As a variety of professions became involved in the care of AD patients, \ndifferent accounts of the reality of AD and the needs of patients started surfacing.  \nOne of most significant of these fractures resulted in the emergence of a coherent \npsychosocial model of dementia in the late 1980\u2018s developed by Tom Kitwood and \nothers (Kitwood 1993). This psychosocial model criticized the biomedical model of \n  8 \ndementia (Bond, 1992), and generated a concern for patients as a \u2017persons\u2018. It \nchanged the focus of research and drew attention to patients\u2018 personal needs, and has \nunderpinned much of the criticism about the imbalance of attention and investment \nbetween the two main axes of the dementia health policy: the \u2017search for a cure\u2018 and \nthe organisation of \u2017care\u2018.    \n \nMild Cognitive Impairment and \u2018the FDA Meeting\u2019 \nIn the past decade or so, the AD bioclinical collective appears to have experienced \nfundamental uncertainty at all levels, from the understanding of the basic \npathogenesis of the condition, to clinical practice and health policy. These \nuncertainties cannot be understood in absolute terms, but only in relation to the \ncoordination achieved in the field during the 1980\u2018s, on the one hand, and the \nemergent agreement within the collective that only preventative strategies could \ntackle the progression and lower the prevalence of AD, on the other. Despite their \nmultiplicity, most of the hypotheses circulated in the field have attempted to identify \nthe \u2017first event\u2018 in the pathological process leading to clinical dementia, and have \nsuggested therapeutic approaches to halt the progression. This perspective encouraged \nincreased interest in identifying pre-clinical stages of dementia (Lock, 2006). In this \nprocess, prodromal dementia categories were positioned as possible re-articulations \nbetween different types of laboratories \u2013 molecular biology, neuropathology, \nneuropsychology, neuroimaging, etc. -- and the clinic, in an attempt to \u2017cool down\u2018 or \nstabilise some of the uncertainties discussed in the last section. \nOne of the most successful re-articulations was the concept of Mild Cognitive \nImpairment. Originally conceived as a specific stage on the GDS scale (Flicker, Ferris \net al. 1991), it was only in the end of the 1990\u2018s that, by the hand of Ronald Petersen \nand colleagues at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, it came to be embody such potential for \nintermediation between the laboratory and the clinic  (Petersen, Smith et al. 1999). \nThis is well exemplified in the justification given for the concept of MCI in an \nimportant review of the concept  \nBasic research, such as the identification of secretase inhibitors and the \ndevelopment of an immunization model for the prevention of amyloid \ndeposition, underscores the importance of developing techniques for early \n  9 \ndetection (of AD). Parallel with these endeavours, clinical research aimed at \nidentifying the earliest signs of cognitive impairment has progressed. \u2026 \nMild cognitive impairment deserves recognition and further study because, as \npreventive treatments for AD become available, it will become incumbent on \nclinicians to identify persons at risk of AD and those with the earliest signs of \nclinical impairment. (Petersen et al. 2001) \n   \nIn its original formulation, MCI defined a transitional stage between normal cognitive \naging and dementia. As a syndrome it consists of the clinical presentation of a \nmemory complaint, accompanied by an objective memory impairment (assessed by \nclinical interviews, psychological and brain imaging tests), but absence of any other \ncognitive impairment, and essentially preserved activities of daily living. MCI also \nexcludes the diagnosis of dementia (Petersen et al. 1999). Based on longitudinal \ncontrolled studies of clinical populations, MCI identifies individuals \u2017at risk of \ndementia\u2018. The aim  of MCI, at this point in time, was mainly to identify a population \nfor research on the bioclinical antecedents of dementia and, as the quote suggests, to \ntest the effectiveness of preventative therapies for AD.  \nThis definition had considerable success in attracting the interest of the AD research \ncommunity (see Figure 1): from 1999 to 2004 the number of publications on MCI \nincreased six fold, in fields ranging from clinical genetics, to epidemiology, \nneuropsychology, and neuroimaging. Pharmaceutical companies, many of which \nfunded a significant proportion of the research on MCI, were interested in the \npossibility that the new category would enable researchers to target a population \nsuitable for a new generation of drugs.      \n  10 \n  \nFig 1: Source (Petersen 2005) Reproduced by kind permission of the \nauthor.  \nAs was suggested in the last section, the shifting understanding of the \npathogenesis of AD, combined with the \u2017modest\u2018 clinical effects of ChEIs, led to a re-\norientation of basic and therapeutic research. It was thus possible to observe that, \nduring the 1990\u2018s this bioclinical collective moved towards a new therapeutic \nvocabulary that emphasized the ability for molecular compounds to be \u2017disease \nmodifying\u2018 (Moreira, in Press). Research groups became increasingly interested in \nfinding pharmacological agents that would target the molecular mechanisms that \nprecede neuronal death (amyloid aggregation, etc). This trend also encapsulated the \nidea that these agents would only be effective when used before such pathological \nmolecular processes manifested themselves clinically. It is widely recognised that it is \nvery difficult to evaluate such therapies, both because they are more likely to off-set \nthe risk-benefit ratio acceptable for non-symptomatic individuals involved in clinical \ntrials, and because they require larger, longer and more expensive types of trial design \n(see, for example, Citron, 2004).  \n  11 \nFrom this perspective, MCI presented itself as a possible \u2017bridge\u2018 between \nprevious designs used in this field and new trial designs. If it would be possible to \nfind, through this transitory design, whether a drug could be meaningfully evaluated, \nthe next steps towards funding longer, larger trials could then be taken. If this scenario \nseemed probable, and even desirable for pharmaceutical companies, their researchers \nand their academic collaborators, they had only one problem. MCI was not at that \ntime (circa 2000) recognised as a clinical entity by any of the international or \nprofessional disease classifying institutions.\niv\n There was thus uncertainty about \nwhether the results of ongoing trials would have any meaning for drug approval \ninstitutions such as the FDA.  \nMCI also presented new opportunities for ChEIs marketing licence holders. \nBecause there was an accepted view that ChEIs had moderate effects on cognitive \nabilities and clinical symptoms of dementia, it was possible to argue that such effects \nwould be more significant in milder stages of the disease. This obviously would also \nrepresent an extension of the market for ChEIs. In addition, in previous years there \nhad been controversy about whether the outcomes chosen by the FDA to evaluate \nanti-dementia drugs \u2013 change in cognitive scores plus one global measure of \nfunctioning (Leber, 1990) \u2013 were the most appropriate given that, as one coalition of \nresearchers put it, \u2017[t]he maintenance of baseline levels in \u2026 Alzheimer\u2018s disease \nmay be a more relevant goal to \u2026 individual patients than transient cognitive \nimprovement\u2018 (Winblad et al. 2001: 656). From this perspective, MCI could become \nan important tool to trace the evolution of these baseline scores in a population at \n\u2017risk\u2018. The recognition of MCI patients as a \u2017target population\u2018 by the FDA, in fact, \nwould be an important step in changing the evaluation framework that was (and still \nis) seen to constrain the evaluative performance of ChEIs.  \nMCI brought together the interests of a multiple array of actors and \nconstituencies who identified the FDA as a crucial mediator in this process. This was \nmaterialised in a number of requests to the FDA by companies asking to develop \ntreatments for MCI (Food and Drug Administration, 2001: 10). This created a \nparticular problem for the FDA because its approval of any specific product is linked, \nthrough the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, to how the product is presented in \nits \u2017product label\u2018 and, as Dr. Katz, representing the FDA, said in his opening address \nto the meeting, to \u2017whether or not the population for whom the drug is intended can be \nunambiguously described\u2018 (Food and Drug Administration, 2001: 11).  The FDA thus \n  12 \nhad to take the unusual step of assessing the validity, reliability and sensitivity of a \nbioclinical construct, and of evaluating whether the existing ambiguities of the \nconcept were likely to disappear or increase.  \nIn order to take that step, the FDA\u2018s Peripheral and Central Nervous System \nDrugs Advisory Committee organised a meeting to which it invited a panel of FDA \nexperts, public speakers and an audience. \u2017The FDA meeting\u2018, as it subsequently \ncame to be known by researchers and practitioners in the field, was held on 13\nth\n of \nMarch 2001, and included presentations by eight experts, who were selected by the \nFDA on the basis of contributions to research on MCI. They were: Dr. Petersen, the \nneurologist who proposed the term in its current use; Dr. Dekoski, neurologist and \nadvocate of the clinical application of a PET scan approach to dementia biomarking \n(Lopresti et al. 2005); Dr. Duara, a neurologist known for his view that MCI is a \ngeneral syndrome associated with various pathologies (Loewenstein et al. 2006);  Dr. \nReisberg, a geriatric psychiatrist particularly concerned with the clinical significance \nof subjective memory impairment (Flicker et al. 1991); Dr. Ganguli, general \npsychiatrist and epidemiologist of dementia, a \u2017friendly sceptic\u2018 towards the concept \n(Ganguli et al. 2004); Dr. Ferris, a psychologist, collaborator of Dr. Reisberg; Dr. \nShah, psychologist and proponent of the cognitive testing approach to dementia \nscreening; and one representative of an European drug development team, Dr. \nWaegemans. In addition, various (mainly expert) participants in the audience were \nallowed to ask questions to the panel.  \nThe panel and speakers were asked to answer and discuss the following \nquestions:  a) Can MCI be clearly defined in a clinical setting? b) Are there valid \ncriteria for the diagnosis of MCI? c) Can MCI be distinguished from Alzheimer\u2018s \nDisease and other causes of dementia? d) What outcome measures are appropriate to \nuse in clinical drug trails conducted in MCI? and e) Should clinical drug trials in MCI \nincorporate any special features in their design? Although biomolecular and other \nbasic researchers were not present at the meeting, the discussions were framed by the \nneed to articulate new biomolecular models of AD with clinical practice, including \nthe possibility of using biological \u2017surrogate markers\u2018 such as brain imaging or CSF \nanalysis as measures in clinical trials.              \n \n  13 \nThe Collective Production of Uncertainty \nThe FDA meeting\u2018s agenda was aligned with the emerging epistemic and biomedical \nexpectations of the collective that were referred to in the beginning of the last section. \nIn setting the meeting, its organisers were required to \u2017translate\u2018 these expectations \nand processes into a confined space (Callon, 1986). This transposition entailed the \ncoordination of persons, spaces and materials that together could \u2017make present\u2018 the \ncomplex interrelations of a bioclinical collective. In this \u2017the FDA meeting\u2018 shared a \nnumber of characteristics with clinical practice guideline development meetings, in \nparticular the focus on the interaction between the discussion within the meeting and \nthe \u2017outside world\u2018, both as context of production of the issues discussed in the \nmeeting, and as context of reception of the documents and policies assembled at the \nmeeting (Moreira, 2005).  It thus became acutely important to establish temporal and \nsymbolic linkages between those contexts. Analysis of the transcript of the FDA \nmeeting suggests that this was achieved in three steps, albeit not sequentially. The \nboundary between the context of the meeting and the meeting itself was built through \nthe (mainly discursive) enactment of a link between the uncertainties surrounding the \ncategory of MCI and the group of experts assembled at the meeting. How the \nparticipants maintained this link throughout the meeting is the focus of the first \nsubsection below. If the participants had not attempted to extend uncertainty to other, \nhitherto unopened black boxes, this might have threatened the correlated solidarity of \nthe confined collective assembled at the meeting. This redistribution of uncertainty is \nthe focus of the second subsection. The third subsection explores how participants \ndrew from this extended uncertainty to articulate a policy to link research and clinical \npractice, based on the transience of MCI as a category. This policy could be the \nreason why the FDA meeting became a turning point in the history of MCI and the \nAD bioclinical collective.   \nPutting a Fence Around a Mystery \nThe main challenge the FDA faced in preparing this meeting was to balance the \nrepresentation of the various perspectives about MCI proposed in the field with the \nneed to achieve an accountable outcome within the given time constraints. The choice \nof speakers thus followed a policy that Dr. Katz summarised in his opening remarks \nto the meeting,  \n  14 \nMCI, as you know has been characterised variously in the literature but, \nin general, it is a condition that is described as occurring in elderly \npatients who predominantly have a memory impairment \u2026 and patients \nare considered neither to be normal nor to have dementia but their \ncognitive status falls somewhere in between. (Food and Drug \nAdministration, 2001: 10, our emphasis) \nDr. Katz reduces the range in perspectives on MCI, including those that questioned \nthe utility of trying to describe it in the first place, by accepting that \u2017in general, it is a \ncondition\u2019. This re-description of the epistemic status of MCI in \u2017the literature\u2018 allows \nhim to bring together the participants in the meeting because it makes visible the \ndifference between \u2017out there\u2018 and \u2017in here\u2018 by confining the level of uncertainty that \nthe meeting will take into account. The micropolitical significance of this policy is \nimportant to note: it enables the collective exploration of the uncertainty and \ncontroversy about MCI at the meeting to be guarded against outright challenge or \ndeconstruction.  Having established this, Dr. Katz then goes on to say that, \nIn the case of MCI there is not unanimity in the literature about the \ndiagnostic criteria that can reliably identify patients who are alleged to \nhave the condition. So, as I say, one of the critical questions we would \nlike you to address is whether or not you believe that there does exist a \nset of criteria that can be readily applied by practitioners and that can \nreproducibly and reliably identify patients presumed to have MCI. (p. \n11) \nThe shift in the epistemic status of MCI from \u2017a condition\u2018 to an \u2017alleged\u2018 reality or \n\u2017presumed\u2018 diagnosis is striking. But Dr. Katz does more than just deepen the doubt \nthat he and the FDA are prepared to cast upon MCI, he also sets up the basic rules of \nthe \u2017sociology of knowledge machine\u2018 of the meeting (Lynch, 1998). The selected \npresenters are asked to give their views of whether or not they \u2017believe that there does \nexist a set of criteria\u2018 to identify MCI against a sceptical panel. This format is familiar \nto the FDA members, who apply it to assess and deconstruct claims made by \npharmaceutical companies about drugs. In the context of this \u2017unusual\u2018 meeting, \nhowever, the questioning could not be solely focused on the strength of the claims \npresented to the Committee, as the links that support the reliability of MCI were in \nquestion from the very beginning. In effect, it appears that the FDA\u2018s usual machinery \n  15 \nwas put in the service of exploring the possible and expected articulations between \nresearch and practice that different versions of MCI might offer. This is observable, \nfor example, in the Q&A that followed Dr. Petersen\u2018s presentation. \nDR. KAWAS: Actually, I would like to ask a question of Dr. Petersen, \nand it has to do primarily with the issue of defining this entity out in the \nclinical setting. \u2026 [I]n the clinical setting what instruments would you \nrecommend that the clinician be using to identify these individuals? \nWould it be the four that you showed us and the ones that we use in the \nresearch environment, or what are your thoughts on that? \nDR. PETERSEN: That actually is a very important issue and a difficult \none because while I think it is a readily identifiable condition, that is, \nthere are a fair number of people who fall into this, I am not necessarily \nconvinced that it can be identified in a quick and dirty fashion. [In a \nclinical trial] we are using the Mini-Mental State performance above 24. \n\u2026 Then, we are using a memory tool, paragraph recall \u2026. Again, that is \nnot the end-all, be-all but I think it takes something like that. I don't \nthink it can be done quickly in the office setting. (p. 46) \nDr. Kawas\u2018 question deals with the possibility of extending the detection of MCI in \ncontexts other than the research settings where it was originally formulated. As Dr. \nPetersen\u2018s reply makes clear, Dr. Kawas is interested in knowing what forms of work \nsupport this diagnostic convention. In Dr. Petersen\u2018s opinion, the diagnostic work that \nproduces MCI cannot be easily extended to \u2017the office setting\u2018 in primary or non-\nspecialist care. This might explain the difference between what he estimates to be the \n\u2017number of people who fall into this\u2018 category and those who were actually identified \nat the time of the meeting. By suggesting that MCI requires a specialist setting to be \nidentified, Dr. Petersen is also advocating a way to address the uncertainty that had \nlingered and still lingers over MCI: managing and perhaps reducing this uncertainty in \nthe \u2017expert\u2018 setting of AD centres.  \nThe transportability of MCI thus became one of the central points of debate \nwithin the meeting, not only because it focuses on the uncertainty about whether or \nnot MCI \u2017really exists\u2018, but also because it offers different answers to the questions \nposed by the FDA about clinical trial design. This link was explicitly made in a \nquestion to Dr. Ferris by Dr. Wolinski, one the member of the FDA committee: \n  16 \nDR. WOLINSKY: I guess one of the things that I am struggling with is  \n\u2026 if you could actually construct a trial and were lucky enough to have \na pharmacologic agent, carried out in careful clinical settings, that \nactually delayed the progression from phase I to phase II, or whatever \nwe call this, and the person on the street can only diagnose phase II and \nwe don't know whether starting the drug at phase II will prevent \nprogression to phase III, what do we then do when we have a drug for \nwhich no one can make a diagnosis except in very rigorous, well-\ndefined confines? (p. 98) \nA similar point is addressed by Dr. Ganguli later in her response to a question posed \nby Dr. Duara: \nDR. GANGULI: Well, I share your view about the [existence of a \ncognitive] continuum, and my understanding of why we are discussing \nthis conversion is only to try and find out an appropriate endpoint for an \nMCI trial. My view as a clinician is that I can already treat somebody \noff-label if I think that he has incipient AD. I don't really need to have \nthe FDA or DS to say that MCI is a non-indication. So, if the question is \nhow do we better define this condition for its own sake so we \nunderstand the pathology, that is one thing. If you are saying how do we \ndefine it as an indication for drugs, that is a question I am not qualified \nto answer. (p. 131) \nIn Dr. Ganguli\u2018s view of the link between these two issues is evidently problematic: \nby putting the two together, the FDA and, for that matter, the rest of the presenters, \nwere defining MCI as a suitable stage to test and probably use new, preventative \ntherapies for AD.  For her, the question of whether or not MCI is an entity \u2017out in the \ntrenches\u2018 precedes the formulation of a therapeutic or public health strategy. \nFollowing this exchange, various participants suggest possible estimations of \nprevalence of MCI in the general population, none of them actually supported by data, \nwhich leads Dr. Kawas to the conclusion that \u2017what we need to do to find the estimate \nthat people are looking for is to go back to the trenches\u2018 (p. 138).  \nThe FDA\u2018s \u2017sociology of knowledge machine\u2018 appears to have worked here to \nreduce the conflict between the two versions of how to define the uncertainty of MCI. \nFurthermore, the co-existence and proposed synchronicity of a programme of \n  17 \nepidemiological research with a programme of therapeutic research also represents a \ndifferent approach to the management of uncertainty proposed by Dr. Ganguli. While \nhers is a staged approach where the contours of the problem have to be defined before \nthinking how to tackle it, the FDA\u2018s proposal was one of maximising possible \nuncertainties.  Importantly, the FDA proposal also opened up the possibility of a \nfuture alignment between the epidemiology of MCI, its extended clinical use as \ndiagnostic category, and the implementation of therapeutic strategies. \nOne important aspect of this policy of opening a future where differences might \ncoordinate is that it relied on cautious surveillance over the black boxing processes \nduring the meeting. Near the end of the meeting, Dr Van Belle, a member of the \ncommittee, alludes to such black boxing with a reference to putting \u2017a fence around \nthe mystery\u2018: \nDR. VAN BELLE: I think we have defined a mystery. We have sort of \nput a fence around the mystery but we have really heard many ways of \ndefining MCI today and I am not sure that there is a consistent \noperational entity that we can deal with at a relatively simple level. \u2026 I \nam not sure that it is very useful from a clinical point of view to try to \ndo something like this at a national level. From a research level, an \ninstitution or a group could come to some agreement as to how they are \ngoing to define operationally such an entity and then do some research \non that. But in terms of really having a clinical entity, I just haven't seen \nthe evidence yet. (p. 205)  \nDr. Katz\u2018s view was not much different: \nAt least by some definition as I understand the Petersen criteria, there \nreally is no functional impairment. Other people have different \ndefinitions of MCI that do include functional impairment. So, you know, \nwe are sort of back to \u2017do we all know what we are talking about when \nwe say MCI?\u2018. (p. 258) \nThe significance of these interventions has to do with the interaction between \nwhat Dr. Belle called the \u2017fence\u2018 and the \u2017mystery\u2018. The discursive production of the \nmystery within the meeting was deployed through an exploration of the uncertainties \nsurrounding MCI \u2013 whether it is one thing or a complex syndrome with \n  18 \nheterogeneous symptoms, whether it is early AD or an entity in itself, etc. The \ncommittee\u2018s dissatisfaction with the answers provided by the speakers enabled the \nparticipants to widen the collective that was concerned with this \u2017entity\u2018s\u2018 probable \nexistence: whereas at the beginning of the meeting, MCI was located within a few \nresearch clinics, the exploration of uncertainties in the relation between these sites and \nthe \u2017real world\u2018 (of everyday clinical practice) or epidemiological and biomolecular \nresearch provided a new, extended set of possible relations for MCI.   \nThe successful management of this collective exploration of uncertainty \ndepends upon the construction of boundaries for the collective. As Michel Callon and \nVololona Rabeharisoa (1998) have argued, this task is intrinsically political, as it \nrelates to the ability to stabilise a \u2017forum\u2018 of debate and, through its procedures of \ndebate, to determine the collective\u2018s extension and composition in a form of dynamic \ncontainment. The composition of the \u2017fence\u2018 that Dr. Belle was referring to is thus \nintimately associated with his suggestion that \u2017an institution or group should come to \nsome agreement\u2018. Similar suggestions were reiterated throughout the meeting. \nTogether, they lead us to the view that the FDA committee was attempting to \nestablish a continuity between this meeting and future meetings as a basis for the \nextended collective they had just reshaped. This was achieved through a careful \narticulation between different types of uncertainty. \nRedistributing Uncertainty \nThe collective production of uncertainty about MCI at the FDA meeting and the \ncorrelated establishment of procedures and actors to manage it was itself a risky \nstrategy. Why would the FDA and the collective they supported be invested in a \n\u2017mystery\u2018? How could this collective know that the mystery would become less \nmysterious through this strategy? In order to address this practical problem, \nparticipants in the meeting collectively reflected about key established conventions in \nthis field, and in particular the criteria for diagnosis of AD. This entailed looking into \nthe \u2017black box\u2018 of the very definition of AD: the association of clinical diagnosis of \ndementia with the neuropathological diagnosis post mortem confirming the presence \nof neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.  \nDr. Kekoski\u2018s presentation highlighted this issue as follows:     \nIn [a neuropathological correlation study], [Dr. Davis] looked at his \ncases that had the postmortem CDR of 0.5 -- now we are moving to the \n  19 \n\u2026 transition stage that [Dr. Petersen] discussed \u2026. In this particular \ncase, when Davis looked at his postmortem CDRs, about 60 percent of \nthese cases would have met criteria for Alzheimer's disease at autopsy. \nIn our study of the cases, again about 60 percent of these cases also had \nevidence of AD. There is a bit of a paradox here. All of our [MCI] cases \nwould get a diagnosis of possible AD under CERAD [neuropath] \ncriteria. Again, we are a victim of our definitions. To have a CERAD \ndefinition of definite AD by autopsy you must have evidence of \ndementia in life. So, we have a logical contradiction here. We cannot \nsay these patients had dementia in life; they are the MCI cases. So, if \nthey had enough plaques to make a diagnosis by CERAD criteria of \ndementia the highest they can get is a possible AD diagnosis. They \nwould have to have had evidence of dementia in life and those path \nchanges to get definite AD. (pp. 55-56, our emphasis) \nThe consortium to establish a registry for Alzheimer's disease (CERAD) had \nproposed standard neuropathological criteria for the posmortem diagnosis of AD \n(Mirra et al. 1991), which by 2001 was generally accepted and used, particularly in \nthe US. However, as Dr. DeKosky makes clear, the neuropathological diagnosis of \nAD depends upon a prior clinical diagnosis of dementia. The clinical diagnosis of \nMCI, or of an equivalent \u2017transitional stage\u2018, introduces a degree of uncertainty to this \nprocess, in that it is possible for non-demented patients to meet the CERAD neuropath \ncriteria for AD. This contradiction makes visible the conventionality of the clinical \nstandard for AD diagnosis. In Dr. DeKosky\u2018s view, the constraining powers of the \ncategory become more significant than what they facilitate, thus making researchers \nand clinicians \u2017victims\u2018 of their own definitions. \nQuestioning the adequacy of the clinical standard for AD diagnosis became a \nrecurrent strategy in the participants\u2018 discussion. Later, in the open discussion section \nof the meeting, Dr. Chui, of the University of Southern California, summarised the \nissue:    \nDr. CHUI: \u2026 I think that because MCI is the frontier now we might be \nassuming that the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is firm. We have \ndropped the terminology probable Alzheimer's disease, possible \nAlzheimer's disease, and here we are just using Alzheimer's disease. \n  20 \nSome of us have acknowledged that we are saying clinical diagnosis of \nAlzheimer's disease. The Alzheimer's disease centers have shown that \nwhen you look at pathology as the gold standard the clinical diagnosis of \nAlzheimer's disease is fairly sensitive in research settings but it is not \nspecific. The sensitivity among 28 centers, collectively contributing over \n2000 cases of dementia, was about 93 percent sensitive but only 55 \npercent specific. So, the accuracy was about 85 percent. If you use that \nin evidence-based dementia terms, the likelihood ratio is about 4, which \nisn't considered a very good diagnostic test. (pp. 223-24) \nOne particularly interesting aspect of this strategy is how the \u2017firmness\u2018 of the clinical \nstandard for the diagnosis of AD is undone by referring to other standards -- the \nCERAD criteria or, in Dr. Chui\u2018s case, evidence-based medicine criteria for grading \ndiagnostic procedures (Sackett et al. 2000). The problematic nature of the AD \ndiagnostic standard could then be compared with the problems the FDA committee \nwas exploring in relation to MCI diagnostic criteria. This suggested that accepting the \nuncertainties of MCI would require acknowledging the quasi arbitrariness of AD \n(Whitehouse, 2001). That the focus of this comparison was the clinical setting should \nnot be surprising because it is in such settings \u2013 the Alzheimer\u2018s centres \u2013 that the \nparticipants had invested hope in finding consistency and validity for MCI. \nFurthermore, this amounted to a challenge to the FDA\u2018s approved labelling of \ndementia drugs based on clinical trials of patients diagnosed with AD through those \ncriteria. Some of the participants in the FDA meeting seemed to be suggesting that if \nthe ambiguity of MCI was reason for the FDA to be cautious about extending \nlabelling of existing drugs, so should the ambiguity of AD have been a barrier to their \napproval in the first place.      \nThe solution to this challenge led participants to explore the historicity of their \nconventions. Interestingly, it was left to the representative from the \u2017real world\u2018, Dr. \nGanguli, to identify the problem:          \n[We] are all quite familiar with [the criteria for MCI by now] but \u2026 I \nwould like to focus your attention on number five for the moment, \nwhich is what do we mean by not demented? We are, as [Dr. DeKoski] \nsaid, victims of our own criteria. We are victims of these dementia \ncriteria. The NINCDS criteria were published in 1984. They say that \n  21 \nyou cannot have onset of AD after age 90. Well, this is 2001 and I have \npatients who were perfectly fine until the age of 92. What am I supposed \nto call them? Are we going to be locked in forever into these criteria \nthat were written, you know, in good faith 20 years ago? We have \nlearned a lot since them. Are we allowed to move the criteria along \nbecause it is not just where does normal aging cross over into MCI; it is \nalso when do we say that they are now demented? (p. 121, our \nemphasis)      \nDr. Ganguli suggested that she was facing a new clinical reality, perhaps \nunderpinned by changes in the incidence of cognitive aging in the population between \n1984 and 2001. Moreover, there had been a change in the knowledge base about the \nrates of cognitive aging expected at particular ages. Whereas in 1984, it seemed \ninadequate to categorise an individual as demented if s\/he was over 90 years of age, \nbecause most were likely to have symptoms of dementia, in 2001, there was a clear \ndistinction between individuals of that age group who became demented and those \nwho did not. She thus offered a new interpretation for why the constraining aspects of \nthe conventional standards used in AD appeared to be strengthening: the inadequacies \nof the NINDS criteria (McKhann et al. 1984) were the result of the historical changes \nin the \u2017object\u2018 and the knowledge about AD. It was not a case of a fundamental flaw \nwith the criteria: times had changed and so should conventions.  \nRecognising the historicity of conventions came to have crucial importance for \ndeveloping the discussion. It brought into focus the temporal aspects of processes of \nadoption of conventions in research and clinical communities. Documenting the \nhistory of the uptake of AD diagnosis criteria allowed participants to, once more, \ndraw equivalences between AD and MCI. The possibility of conducting clinical trials \non MCI or using MCI in the clinic was a matter of time: \nDR. KAWAS: And, if drugs were to be used for [MIC], how would you \nimagine training the clinicians to do the same thing? \nDR. WAEGEMAN: That is always the difference between the ideal \nsituation of a clinical trial and real life, but I think it was already \nmentioned today that ten years ago, twenty years ago there was a \ndifficult problem in diagnosing dementia. We think that we have now \n  22 \nsolved this problem. Maybe in five years time we will be a lot further in \nteaching how to diagnose MCI. (p. 188) \n \nDr. Kawas\u2018 interest in the possibility of MCI being used in the clinic is couched in the \nidea that not only does MCI take work to be made visible but also it takes work to \nshape this form of diagnostic criteria This is also contained in Dr Waegemans\u2018 reply, \nwhich emphasised the time lag that takes to make conventions usable in the clinic.  \nSuch an understanding of AD diagnosis was unproblematic for most of the \nparticipants, who had experienced the process of implementing the NINCDS criteria \nduring their professional training or practice. From their perspectives, the adoption \nprocess was independent from the problems of diagnostic accuracy for AD. It was as \nif participants were suggesting that it was possible to implement consistent diagnostic \nconventions regardless of their accuracy.  \nBy highlighting the historical character of diagnostic criteria for AD, \nparticipants at the FDA meeting shifted the burden of responsibility on MCI \nproponents. It was then possible to ask, as did Dr. Duara \u2017are we applying an \nunreasonable standard \u2026 to MCI when we are [asking] do we have well defined \nstandards?\u2018 (p. 278). One important consequence of this change, in light of what was \nargued in the last section, was that the uncertainty of AD diagnostic criteria became \npart of the wider problem for the collective in which MCI was the key mediating \nentity. Embracing AD diagnosis in the MCI strategy of uncertainty management \nmeant also that this collective was not only concerned with differences on a \nsynchronous level, but also was committed to re-writing the history of AD. As one of \nus has argued elsewhere, drawing on the case of neurosurgery, the production of \ndis\/continuities in the history of collectives is essential for the practical achievement \nof \u2017innovation\u2018 (Moreira, 2000). Similarly, to make MCI possible, AD had to become \nclose to being a contingent outcome of history. \nThe Strength of Transient Entities \nThere were however consequences from investing in this strategy of extended \nuncertainty for MCI itself. If AD diagnostic criteria were a product the past, who \ncould say that the same would not happen to MCI in a few years time? Why would \nclinicians need to question something that, despite its inaccuracies, still \u2017did its job\u2018, \nand why shouldn\u2018t they trust MCI as a category if there was no certainty about its \n  23 \nfoundations? The remarkable solution that participants devised for this problem \ndemonstrates how conventions are integral for action and for generating knowledge \nwithin bioclinical collectives (Cambrosio et al. 2006). Answering one of the FDA \npanelist\u2018s question in his presentation, Dr. Ferris argued that, \nMCI broadly speaking is a heterogeneous syndrome. However, \nhomogeneous groups representing prodromal AD or other subtypes can, \nI think, reliably be identified. MCI trials can examine disease \nprogression or at least clinical progression and provide a bridge in drug \ndevelopment between symptomatic trials and the ultimate goal of \ndisease prevention trials. (p. 94) \nWhile, as we know, the FDA committee was not prepared to agree with Dr. \nFerris\u2018 version of the diagnostic reliability of MCI criteria, his proposal that MCI \ntrials become a \u2017bridge between symptomatic trials and the ultimate goal of disease \nprevention trials\u2018 seemed acceptable. Of course, by accepting this proposal, the FDA \ncommittee also would be agreeing that MCI is an indication for the drugs tested in \nthose trials. This might have been construed as a direct challenge to Dr. Katz\u2018s \ncontention, discussed earlier, that the FDA must adhere to the Federal Food, Drug and \nCosmetic Act, except for the fact that the committee had first-hand knowledge of the \nconvoluted relations between nosological knowledge and therapeutic evaluation. Dr. \nTemple of the FDA used the example of cardiovascular drugs to describe these \nrelations: \nI think the history of these kinds of difficulties is that you do the best \nyou can, and that sometimes things happen to enable you to distinguish \nthings that you formerly felt were the same better than you could before. \nSorry to use another cardiovascular example, but we now know that \nheart failure comes in two flavours and that the treatments are widely \ndifferent depending on whether your problem is the ventricular beat \nsystolic function or filling, diastolic function. And, the drugs that work \nin one don't necessarily work in the other and might even be adverse. \nBut for decades people didn't realize this and all of the above got \nincluded in clinical trials. That probably decreased the effectiveness of \ncertain treatments but since we didn't know any better and the net effect \nwas beneficial the drugs were approved for undifferentiated heart \n  24 \nfailure. Now that we are smarter we won't do that anymore. So, the \nsituation conceivably, I guess, could be the same here \u2026. It wouldn't be \nthe first time, and I am sure some of the people in later Alzheimer's \ndisease trials really had something other than Alzheimer's disease. I \nmean, it is hard to imagine that diagnostic accuracy was a hundred \npercent. (pp. 234-35)           \n  The interaction between knowledge of diseases and therapeutic research is \nsuch that clinical trials can only be described as (to paraphrase Dr. Temple) historical \nevents. In the contingent situation surrounding the trial \u2017you do the best you can\u2018 in \nthe knowledge that the concepts and data supporting the results may be incomplete or \nwrong. Thus, it is necessary to de-emphasise the need for an absolute fit between \ndisease and drug, even when drugs are approved. What might seem like a sensible \npolicy from the FDA\u2018s point of view, represents for the proponents of MCI an \nopportunity to employ the category as an entry point into clinical trials. It is \nsignificant, furthermore, that Dr. Temple, when drawing on the extended uncertainty \ndiscussed in the last subsection, accepts the precedent that in the AD field trials might \nhave been conducted with patients who did not have that disorder. And the situation \n\u2017could be the same here\u2018 with MCI.  \nIn order to understand why the FDA would be willing to support clinical trials \nin an ambiguous situation, such as with MCI, it is necessary to remind ourselves that \nthe FDA committee had already established that the question of knowing what MCI \nwas, was really a question of defining it as an indication for drugs. In Dr. Temple\u2018s \nintervention, the clinical trial figures both as a technique to test the effectiveness of \ndrugs and as an heuristic tool to explore disease mechanisms. This concurs with Dr. \nFerris proposition that MCI trials are a bridge between therapeutic \u2017paradigms\u2018. If it \nwas possible to conduct an MCI trial, one would be testing not only the drugs in \nquestion but also the design of the trial, and consequently the adequacy of MCI as an \nentry point, an indication for drugs and as diagnostic entity (Vos, 1991). The \ncircularity of the process was predicated upon the ability to transfer the collective \nfrom one MCI \u2017paradigm\u2018 to another. If MCI were here to stay, it would lose its \nheuristic role..  \nIt is important to stress that by accepting the heuristic, bridging role of MCI, \nthe FDA meeting does more than legitimise an idea that was already in circulation in \n  25 \nthe field for a few years. By transposing this proposal to the confined collective of \n\u2017the FDA meeting\u2018, participants linked this idea to a wider set of policies and \nprogrammes of action. Endorsing MCI as a \u2017means of transportation\u2018 for the AD \nbioclinical collective was closely aligned with the policies of articulation and \nextension of uncertainty discussed earlier. In effect, it could be argued that in \u2017the \nFDA meeting\u2018, what may have earlier been seen as three different aspects of MCI \u2013 \nits epistemic uncertainty, its relation to AD, and its status in trials of old and new \ntreatments for dementia \u2013 had now become intertwined. The policies that came out of \n\u2017the FDA meeting\u2018 summoned basic, clinical and epidemiological researchers, drug \ndevelopers, clinicians, patient associations and regulatory institutions to use MCI as a \ntemporary scaffolding device that would align their different purposes and interests. \nAs a temporary mediator, MCI would allow them to explore the uncertainties that \nconcerned this collective.  \nThe collective production of uncertainty is embedded in actors\u2018 reflexive work \non the historicity of conventional standards. This suggests that participants in \u2017the \nFDA meeting\u2018 were acting as \u2017practical historians\u2018 (Garfinkel in Lynch and Bogen \n1996: 62) and that the collective production of evidence required actors to engage \nwith the organisational and political work that assembled documented past and \npresent conventions. Unearthing the contingent relations and processes that sustained \nthe emergence of past conventions did not, however, lead participants to seek a more \npermanent foundation for the conventions they were creating. The transience of those \nconventions was in fact their main attraction, in that they were built to effect a \ntransition between one stage and another, between one set of relations and another.   \n \nThe influence of the policies endorsed in \u2017the FDA meeting\u2018 -- that MCI could \nbe \u2017tested\u2018 in clinical trials -- would only become apparent in later years as research \nresults surfaced, clinical trials were finished, and the research and clinical \ncommunities came to re-assess the epistemic value of MCI. However, what was to \ncome was predicted in an interview for Fortune magazine by Harry Tracy, of the \nconsultancy company Neuroinvestment, in his assessment that the FDA\u2018s \nendorsement of MCI opened a \u2017totally new landscape for developing memory drugs\u2018 \n(Stipp, 2001). A measure of the accuracy of this prediction is the growth in the \nnumber of trials on MCI registered in the FDA sponsored on-line database \n(http:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/): a 13 fold increase from 5 in 2000 to 46 on-going and \n  26 \ncompleted trials in 2007. These include trials of therapies previously licensed for AD, \nas well as new pharmacological compounds, and lifestyle and behavioural \ninterventions. This can also be seen from the 76% increase in the number of \npublications on MCI between 2001 and 2002 (see Figure 1). But the most significant \neffect of this meeting in was in how it set methodological standards for therapeutic \nevaluations of drugs for treating MCI (Jelic et al. 2006), which implemented the \npolicies set at the meeting for exploring uncertainty.    \nA good illustration of this point concerns the announcement of the results of \none of the first clinical trials using MCI as baseline diagnostic \u2013 a trial of Vitamin E \nand a cholinesterase inhibitor (Donepezil) led by Dr. Petersen and sponsored by the \nNational Institute of Aging and Pfizer\/Esai (Petersen et al, 2005)\u2013 which was \ndiscussed sceptically by expert audiences at international conferences between 2004 \nand 2006 (see endnote 1). While there was agreement that the trial had demonstrated \nnegative results for primary end points \u2013 conversion from MCI to AD \u2013 most \ncommentators have emphasised its success in designing and conducting a valid MCI \ntrail. In an Editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the trial was \neventually published, for example, Deborah Blacker suggested that:   \n[r]ather than wait for new agents, Petersen et al. carefully evaluated the \nability of two standard treatments for established Alzheimer\u2018s disease to \nslow the progression from mild cognitive impairment to frank \nAlzheimer\u2018s disease. \u2026 The present trial represents a major step \nforward in the literature on trials of treatment for mild cognitive \nimpairment. \u2026 What lessons does the study by Petersen et al. offer \nclinicians and their patients with mild cognitive symptoms? First, \nsymptoms of memory loss in older persons should be taken seriously, \nsince they may represent the beginning of Alzheimer\u2018s disease, and \u2014 \nonce more effective early interventions are available \u2014 it will be critical \nto ask patients about these symptoms and learn to recognize them as \nearly as possible. (Blacker, 2005) \nThe clinical significance of MCI derived from its ability to produce \nmeasurable effects in a clinical trial. In this it might have helped that results were \nclearly \u2013 significantly -- negative for Vitamin E and \u2013 not so significantly \u2013 for \nDonepezil on the conversion of MCI to AD. Nevertheless, the circularity between \n  27 \nconventional standards, therapy and therapeutic evaluation (Vos, 1991; Lakoff, 2005: \n173-74), which had been set up in the FDA meeting, resurfaced in a clear message by \na leading medical journal endorsing the use of MCI in the clinic. \nIn addition, only by reference to \u2017the FDA meeting\u2018 is it possible to \nunderstand that, while or even before such general endorsement took place, the main \nproponent of MCI, Dr. Petersen, could write these words in the leading monograph on \nthe topic: \nUltimately, MCI is likely to be a heuristic concept. It has generated and \nwill continue to spawn research on aging and early cognitive \nimpairment. At some point the term will be discarded and another will \ntake its place. Hopefully, the concept will have contribute to an \nunderstanding of the spectrum of cognition from normal aging to AD \n(Petersen, 2003: 12) \nAccepting the transience of MCI may have been the price its proponents had to pay \nfor bringing it into the \u2017real world\u2018.              \nConclusion \nSocial science research on regulatory practices in medicine has examined changes in \nthe social organisation of medical work, new forms of medical innovation, evidence-\nbased medicine, shifts in professional autonomy, and the positioning of users.  \nAnalytical emphases tend to fall either on exogenous or endogenous drivers of \nregulation. The consolidation of biomedicine in recent decades has put the boundaries \nof medicine in question (Gaudilliere, 2002; Clarke et al. 2003; Keating & Cambrosio, \n2003), and it is argued that regulatory bodies such as the FDA are integral to the \ndynamics of biomedicine (Cambrosio et al. 2006). This paper focused on how \nregulatory bodies fulfil such role by exploring how their \u2017knowledge machinery\u2018 \nframes the collective production of new diagnostic conventions and standards.  \nOur close analysis of the FDA meeting on MCI  suggests that the deployment \nof uncertainty is reflexively implicated in bioclinical collectives\u2018 search for rules and \nconventions, and that the collective production of uncertainty is in fact central to the \n\u2017knowledge machinery\u2018 of regulatory objectivity. We have shown that a) the reflexive \nachievement of uncertainty is predicated upon collectives\u2018 (re)building of socio-\ntechnical boundaries, b) that these boundaries facilitate the re-opening of surrounding \n  28 \nepistemic, technical and social black boxes, and c) that it is possible for some \ncollectives to reflexively agree on the temporary, historical nature of their \nfoundations. We suggest further that the process we have described constitutes a \ngeneral feature of biomedicine\u2018s epistemic and technological dynamics, in that the \nproduction and temporary stabilisation of biomedicine\u2018s knowledge and entities \nrequires continuous \u2017uncertainty work\u2018 in the clinic, laboratory and regulatory forum.  \nThis conclusion is relevant for understanding current changes in research, \nclinical management, and policy on dementia. As we have shown, in the aftermath of \nthe FDA meeting, MCI came to embody the promise of new therapeutic \ndevelopments and diagnostic practices for Alzheimer\u2018s disease. However, it could \nonly do so by re-articulating the definition of AD. Some commentators even \nsuggested that it has brought about the \u2017end\u2018 of AD (Whitehouse, 2001). There are \nbenefits and drawbacks to such re-articulation. One the one hand, MCI contributed to \nan increased recognition of the uncertainty around the causes of AD and fostered \nresearch within a multifactorial framework in which specific and non-specific \ncompounds \u2013 for example, statins (Panza et al. 2006) --  co-exist with lifestyle \ninterventions for preventing (or delaying) dementia. On the other hand, the research \nand policy focus on MCI and upstream, precursor biomolecular events in the natural \nhistory of the disease has meant that downstream processes and symptoms are \nreceiving less attention (and resources). This has resulted in a growing imbalance \nbetween the interests and needs of people who already have dementia or are close to \ndeveloping it and those who will possibly benefit from preventative strategies in the \nfuture as a result of the changes in the field of dementia research.  \nFinally, the paper leads to the suggestion that in the exploration of \nuncertainties around and underpinning bioclinical conventions, actors and institutions \ncould do worse than seek the assistance and collaboration of STS academics. Our \nattention to uncertainty, contingency and multiplicity could, in this particular setting, \nhelp not only in unearthing the links that tie present conventions together but also in \nbuilding new, required supports for knowledge making and clinical work. This \nhowever  might prove more challenging than the examination Cole endured in his \nadmissibility hearing (Lynch and Cole, 2008) in that instead of positionings along \ndichotomies of belief and credibility, institutions might require \u2017proof\u2018 of enduring \npolitical commitment to the collective (see \u2017Putting a fence around a \n  29 \nmystery\u2018).Accepting the stability of our alliances may be the price we have to pay for \nbeing able to explore the uncertainties of biomedicine from within. \n                                                 \nNotes \n \ni\n The study was undertaken between 2004 and 2006. Data were collected through: a) historical \nliterature review on MCI and cognate concepts; b) participant observation of scientific conferences in \nthe dementia field,  c) semi-structured interviews with experts in dementia research, care and policy; d) \nobservation of fieldwork in a dementia clinic and in neuropathology laboratory; e) symposia and \nresearch-user workshops . A systematic search strategy was used to identify relevant literature through \nMedLine (1350 refs). Conventional methods of historical research were used to identify key research \npapers. We developed ethnographic fieldwork at seven international biomedical conferences, which \nentailed qualitative, participant observation of communication in the relevant fields. We also conducted \n37 interviews with international experts in dementia research, care and policy. These were qualitative \nsemi-structured interviews on the scientific, clinical and societal meanings of MCI and\/or early \ndiagnosis and prevention of dementia. We used a stratified purposive sampling strategy, according to \nfield of expertise, country and gender, having as main selection criteria the publication of relevant \nscientific, clinical or policy research on MCI identified through the literature review. In symposia and a \nresearch user workshop, potential users of the results of the project -- researchers, clinicians, carers and \npatients -- were invited to discuss the outcomes of the project and to consider how this research might \nmove forward to influence and benefit older people with memory problems. See Moreira & Bond \n(2008), and  Moreira, et al. (2008).  \niiThe concept of \u2017bioclinical collective\u2018 aims to capture the extended, heterogeneous, distributed \ncharacter of the production of evidence that is required by the contemporary intersections between \nlaboratory and the clinic. As the name suggests, such collectives are characterised by a concern around \nan hybrid entity or category that is neither wholly derived from clinical observation nor from laboratory \nexperimentation (Keating and Cambrosio, 2003).  The conceptual genealogy of the concept can be \ntraced back to Callon and Law\u2018s (1995) notion of hybrid collective as an alternative to social network \nor \u2017society\u2018 because as Latour concisely explains, \u2017Unlike society, which is an artefact imposed by the \nmodernist settlement, this terms refers to the association of humans and non-humans. While the \ndivision between nature and society renders invisible the political process by which the cosmos is \ncollected in one livable whole, the word collective makes this process central. Its slogan could be \u2017no \nreality without representation\u2018\u2016 (Latour, 1999: 304). This concept was further developed by Callon and \nRabeharisoa (1998) in their notion of the patient collective  as an unfolding compositions of \nbodies, competences, representations artefacts, procedures and emotions gathered together \nby particular activities around a  particular condition\/illness. As with these concepts, the notion of \nbioclinical collective aims to emphasise the way in which links between heterogeneous entities are \ndeployed in the representation \u2013the convention in this case- that bring them into being.  For this reason, \nwho and what belongs to a particular collective and in what capacity is mostly an empirical that is \nrelated to the activity at hand.     \n  30 \n                                                                                                                                            \niii\n We thank Andrew Webster for having suggested this analytical proposition. \niv\n Although not explicitly, our analysis of the emergence of MCI draws as background previous work \non the dynamics of classificatory systems and diagnostic categories. Of particular significance is \nBowker and Star\u2018s (1999) work on how categories, when left alone, become embedded in practice, \ninvisible as organising, political devices for those who use them. As Bowker and Start remark most \nprofessionals recognise the constructed, conventional nature of the categories and classificatory \nsystems they use although these issue tend not to be explored collectively (Bowker and Star, 1999: \n320). Our study exactly focuses on situations where it is necessary to conduct such exploration.    \n  31 \n                \nReferences \nAnonymous (1989) \u2017Senile Dementia of Alzheimers Type: Normal Aging or \nDisease?\u2018 Lancet 1(8636): 476-77. \nBallenger, Jesse (2006) Self, Senility, and Alzheimer's Disease in Modern America \n(Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press). \nBlacker, Deborah (2005) \u2017Mild Cognitive Impairment: No Benefit from Vitamin E, \nLittle from Donepezil\u2018, New England Journal of Medicine 352(23): 2439-41. \nBond, John (1992) \u2017The Medicalization of Dementia\u2018, Journal of Aging Studies 6(4): \n397-403. \nBourret, Pascale (2005) \u2017BRCA Patients and Clinical Collectives: New \nConfigurations of Action in Cancer Genetics Practices\u2018, Social Studies of \nScience 35(1): 41-68. \nBourret, Pascale and Vololona Rabeharisoa (2008) \u2017Le jugement et la d\u00e9cision \nm\u00e9dicales en situation de forte incertitude : l\u2018exemple de deux pratiques \ncliniques \u00e0 l\u2018\u00e9preuve de la g\u00e9n\u00e9tique\u2018, Sciences, Sociales et Sante 26(1): 33-\n66. \nBowker, Geoffrey and Susan Leigh-Star (1999) Sorting Things Out: Classification \nand Its Consequences (Cambridge MA: MIT Press). \nBrayne, Carol and Peter Calloway (1988) \u2017Normal Aging, Impaired Cognitive \nFunction, and Senile Dementia of the Alzheimers Type: A Continuum\u2018, \nLancet 1(8597): 1265-67. \nCallon, Michel (1986) \u2017Some Elements of a Sociology of Translation: Domestication \nof the Scallops and the Fishermen of St-Brieuc Bay\u2018, in J.
