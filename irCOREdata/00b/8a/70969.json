Introduction\n[2] Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans\n(PCDD\/Fs, dioxins and furans) are a priority group of\ncompounds targeted by the Stockholm Convention on Per-\nsistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), adopted by the United\nNations Environmental Programme (UNEP) on 22 May\n2001 [UNEP, 2001]. Global emissions of PCDD\/Fs are\nthought to be dominated by emissions into the atmosphere\n[Brzuzy and Hites, 1996]. Atmospheric transport is therefore\nthe main transport pathway for PCDD\/Fs away from their\nemission sources to remote places. For example, PCDD\/Fs\nhave been measured in the Arctic and Antarctic atmosphere\n[Hung et al., 2002; Lohmann et al., 2001]. Once PCDD\/Fs\nhave been emitted into the atmosphere, their fate is decided\nin a competition of depletion reactions versus dry and wet\ndeposition to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. A better\nunderstanding of the sources, atmospheric behavior and\ntrends of POPs is sought by the Convention. Research\nshould be undertaken as a means to better judge the long-\nrange transport and the environmental sinks of POPs.\n[3] Attempts to quantify global sources and sinks have\nbeen undertaken for several POPs, such as PCBs, HCB\nand others [Axelman and Broman, 2001; Axelman and\nGustafsson, 2002; Bailey, 2001; Barber et al., 2005;\nBreivik et al., 2002a; 2002b; Jonsson et al., 2003; Meijer\net al., 2003; Simonich and Hites, 1995]. Some global\nbudgets\/sinks of POPs are relatively easy to quantify, such\nas the amount residing in the terrestrial environment.\nNumerous soil samples have to be taken, covering the\ndifferent regions of the globe and appropriate scaling factors\nfor global scale need to be found. For example, the annual\ndeposition flux of PCDD\/Fs to the terrestrial environment\nhas been addressed in great detail in previous work [e.g.,\nBrzuzy and Hites, 1996; Wagrowski and Hites, 2000].\n[4] However, to derive complete global inventories of\nPOPs, the role of oceans and atmosphere as sinks need to be\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 111, D21303, doi:10.1029\/2005JD006923, 2006\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Graduate School of Oceanography, University of Rhode Island,\nNarragansett, Rhode Island, USA.\n2Department of Environmental Chemistry, Institut d\u2019Investigacions\nQu\u0131\u00b4miques i Ambientals de Barcelona, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones\nCient\u0131\u00b4ficas, Barcelona, Spain.\n3Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science, Eidgeno\u00a8ssische\nTechnische Hochschule Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.\n4Environmental Sciences Department, Lancaster University, Lancaster,\nUK.\nCopyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/06\/2005JD006923$09.00\nD21303 1 of 11\nassessed. For oceans, we have proposed using a conceptual\nmodel, linking the air-to-water flux of POPs with their\nuptake in phytoplankton and a subsequent settling flux\nout of the mixed layer into the deep ocean, as presented\nelsewhere [Dachs et al., 2002]. Within that modeling\nframework, the fate of POPs in air and water is not solely\ncontrolled by temperature, but rather driven by the air-\nto-water-to-phytoplankton exchange, with phytoplankton-\nbound POPs being transported to the deep ocean [Dachs\net al., 2002]. Current research is underway to verify the\npredictive power of the modeling framework and derive\ninventories for the amount of POPs sequestered by oceans.\n[5] Finally, deriving an estimate of the atmospheric sink\nof POPs combines the easiest and most difficult aspects of\nenvironmental chemistry. Ambient air measurements of\nPOPs in general and PCDD\/Fs in particular have been\nperformed for decades [e.g., see Lohmann and Jones,\n1998]. The presence of PCDD\/Fs in air is easy to determine,\nas long as air volumes are sufficiently large to overcome\ndetection limits. A particular difficult aspect of many POPs\nand notably PCDD\/Fs is their semivolatility, resulting in\ntheir presence both in gas and particulate phase in the\natmosphere. The correct determination and interpretation\nof measured gas-particle distributions is still subject to\nintense debate [e.g., Dachs and Eisenreich, 2000; Lohmann\nand Lammel, 2004; Mader and Pankow, 2002]. It is\nassumed that the distribution of PCDD\/Fs between gas\nand particulate phase determines their fate: While particle-\nbound POPs are thought to be sheltered from atmospheric\ndepletion reactions, gaseous POPs will undergo OH radical\ninitiated atmospheric depletion reactions [Atkinson, 1996;\nBrubaker and Hites, 1997; Lohmann and Lammel, 2004].\n[6] The aim of this study is to estimate the contribution of\nthe atmosphere as a final sink of PCDD\/Fs due to these\nabove mentioned depletion reactions. Hence what is needed\nis not a measure of the presence of atmospheric PCDD\/Fs,\nbut rather of the rate of their disappearance. The problem is\nto quantify the degradation of compounds, where there is no\ndefined end-product available to determine the rate of\nconversion. Atmospheric depletion is one of the few \u2018\u2018de-\nstructive\u2019\u2019 loss processes, together with biological transfor-\nmation\/mineralization. In contrast, we consider deep soils,\ndeep sea sediments and the deep water column as \u2018\u2018final\u2019\u2019\nsinks of PCDD\/Fs. Surface water and surface soils, on the\nother hand could, depending on air-soil\/water fugacity\ngradients, be either temporary reservoirs or final sinks.\nResearch suggests that PCDD\/Fs in soil are in general far\nfrom equilibrium [e.g., Cousins and Jones, 1998].\n[7] In short, quantifying the atmospheric sink of PCDD\/Fs\nrequires complimentary approaches other than direct\nmeasurements. Modeling offers a rather convenient way\nof estimating the importance of the atmospheric sink term,\nas long as sufficient knowledge is present. From laboratory\nstudies, OH radical reaction constants with PCDD\/Fs are\nknown, and the reactions with NO3 and O3 should be of\nminor importance on a global scale [Atkinson, 1996]. Hence\nglobal OH radical concentrations are needed, coupled with\ntemperature profiles and knowledge of the temperature\ndependency of the reaction rates, if any. Of key interest in\nsuch a model-based estimation is the role of the gas-particle\ndistribution, and how the presence in either phase affects the\natmospheric fate.\n[8] For atmospherically emitted PCDD\/Fs, there are only\ntwo major pathways leaving the atmosphere: deposition\/\nexchange to the Earth\u2019s surface (terrestrials soils and the\noceans) or degradation in the atmosphere (we assume here\nthat any other potential PCDD\/F loss\/destruction is negli-\ngible). Hence, if the global PCDD\/F emissions were known,\nand the resulting settling fluxes to soils and oceans, the\nstrength of the atmospheric sink could be deduced based on\nmass balance considerations, and yet the global source\nstrength of PCDD\/Fs is not known, although attempts are\nunder way by the UNEP to assemble a global PCDD\/F\nrelease inventory [e.g., UNEP, 1999; H. Fiedler, UNEP,\npersonal communication, 2004]. Alternatively, it is possible\nto estimate the atmospheric sink of PCDD\/Fs based on their\nknown deposition fluxes to the Earth\u2019s surface, as long as\nthere is a quantifiable relationship between their atmospheric\nsettling and atmospheric depletion fluxes.\n[9] At present, we know with reasonable certainty the\nannual deposition of PCDD\/Fs to terrestrial surfaces, based\non the work by Hites and his group [e.g., Brzuzy and Hites,\n1995, 1996; Wagrowski and Hites, 2000]. This forms the\nbasis of the research presented here; for PCDD\/Fs emitted\ninto the atmosphere, settling and OH radical destruction are\nthe only removal processes considered. Other atmospheric\ndepletion mechanisms (photolysis, reactions with other\nradicals, reactions in\/on vegetation) are not considered.\nPCDD\/Fs are removed from the atmosphere to either soils\nor water bodies through a combination of wet and dry\ndeposition of gas phase and particulate congeners.\n[10] Three complimentary approaches are pursued to\nderive estimates of the strength of the atmospheric OH\nradical depletion of PCDD\/Fs (Figure 1). In each case, the\ndeposition of PCDD\/Fs to regionally classified soils is used\nto derive the fraction of PCFDD\/Fs depleted in the atmo-\nsphere: (1) in scenario A, a rough estimate of the atmo-\nspheric sink is obtained based on globally averaged OH\nradical concentrations, temperature, atmospheric lifetime\nFigure 1. Three scenarios used to quantify global atmo-\nspheric loss rates for PCDD\/Fs.\nD21303 LOHMANN ET AL.: ATMOSPHERIC SINK FOR PCDD\/FS\n2 of 11\nD21303\nand a constant gas-particle partitioning; (2) in scenario B,\nOH radical, temperature and gas-particle distributions are\naveraged in 2 atmospheric heights, with the deposition\nvelocity being held constant; and (3) in scenario C, the\natmospheric deposition velocity is varied.\n[11] Possible limitations of this approach are the degree to\nwhich (1) other releases than atmospheric emissions\naccount for the derived flux to the terrestrial environment,\n(2) relative and absolute rate of deposition versus depletion\nvelocities are known, and (3) annual deposition fluxes to the\nterrestrial environments are precisely quantified. The limi-\ntations\/validity of these assumptions will be addressed in\nmore detail later. It is certain that atmospheric chemistry\nplays a major role as a sink of PCDD\/Fs through OH radical\ndepletion. In here, we offer a critical calculation of the\natmosphere as a global destructive loss process of PCDD\/\nFs. Initially, the focus is on the OH radical depletion above\nsoils. Then, PCDD\/F deposition to and uptake by oceans are\nalso considered, and the strength of OH radical depletion\nreactions over the oceans is estimated. In the end, this\nenables us to assemble a global picture of the different\nfluxes removing PCDD\/Fs from the atmosphere.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Atmospheric Input Data\n[12] Atmospheric temperature (T), and total suspended\nparticulate matter concentrations [TSP] were based on\nmodeled 5-year averages from an atmospheric general\ncirculation model [Lohmann et al., 1999]. Within the\natmospheric general circulation model, monthly mean oxi-\ndant values including the OH radical [OH] are obtained\nfrom a chemical transport model as described by Feichter et\nal. [1996]. Average values were calculated for every month\nfrom 90\u0001N in 3.75\u0001 increments to 90\u0001S. Two well-mixed\natmospheric compartments were assumed: the boundary\nlayer (0\u20132200 m) and the troposphere (2200\u201310,500 m).\nA two-compartment model was chosen to minimize com-\nputing time. PCDD\/Fs are emitted into the well-mixed\nboundary layer, and the combination of ambient temper-\natures and OH radical concentrations makes it the dominant\nreaction volume. Monthly area-weighted mean values were\ncalculated from 6 different heights each, taking into account\nthe pressure differentials with height.\n2.1.1. Total Suspended Particulate Matter\nConcentrations\n[13] [TSP] were obtained by summing up all the different\naerosol species considered in the general circulation model.\nThese were methane sulfonic acid, sulfate, dust in two size\nfractions (0\u20131 and 1\u20132 mm), sea salt in two size fractions\n(0\u20131 and 1\u201310 mm), and the hydrophobic and hydrophilic\nblack carbon and organic carbon, respectively. In the first\n2 km of the atmosphere, [TSP] < 1 mg\/m3 were found\npoleward of 70\u0001S and concentrations < 10 mg\/m3 for\n60\u201390\u0001N and 0\u201390\u0001S throughout the year. [TSP] > 20 mg\/m3\nwere found between 15 and 50\u0001N, with [TSP] reaching 25\u2013\n35 mg\/m3 from June\u2013September between 19 and 45\u0001N.\nThese aerosols concentrations are in good agreement with\nthe (near ground) values for fine aerosol (i.e., < 2 mm)\nsummarized by [Heintzenberg, 1989]: < 5 mg\/m3 for remote,\n15 mg\/m3 for nonurban continental and >30 mg\/m3 for\nurbanized regions. For 2\u201310 km height, [TSP] were\n< 2.0 mg\/m3 for the SH, and only exceeded 5.0 mg\/m3 from\n15\u201350\u0001N during June\u2013September.\n2.1.2. Atmospheric Temperature\n[14] Mean atmospheric T (0\u20132 km) varied from 233 K in\nthe southern winter near the South Pole to 297 K near 30\u0001N\nin northern summer. In the upper 2\u201310 km, T varied from\n214 K to 263 K.\n2.1.3. OH Radical Concentrations\n[15] [OH] values were taken from Roelofs and Lelieveld\n[1995] and are discussed in more detail by Feichter et al.\n[1996]. The 24-hour averages of [OH] in the first 0\u20132 km\nvaried from close to zero at the poles during the respective\nwinter seasons to > 2.0 \u0002 106 molecules\/cm3 near 30\u0001N\nfrom June to August. [OH] > 1.0 \u0002 106 molecules\/cm3 were\ncalculated for 15\u0001S to 15\u0001N throughout the year, The field\nof [OH] > 1.0 \u0002 106 molecules\/cm3 extended up to 67.5\u0001N\nduring June and July. Between 2 and 10 km height, [OH]\nshowed a similar spatial and temporal distribution, with\nvalues slightly below those in the 0\u20132 km height.\n2.2. [OH] Reaction Rate Constants\n[16] [OH] reaction rates were taken from Brubaker and\nHites [1997] and Kwok et al. [1995]. The temperature\ndependency of the OH radical reactions was calculated by\nregressing the (Arrhenius) activation energy (Eact) against\nthe number of chlorines (N\u0001 Cl) attached to the PCDD\/Fs\n[Brubaker and Hites, 1997, 1998] (see Table 1). The\nfollowing relationships were obtained:\nPCDFs\nEact \u00bc 430\u0002 N\u0004 Cl\u0005 40 K\u00f0 \u00de n \u00bc 3\u00f0 \u00de \u00f01\u00de\nPCDDs\nEact \u00bc 60\u0002 N\u0004 Cl\u00fe 550 K\u00f0 \u00de n \u00bc 2\u00f0 \u00de \u00f02\u00de\nThese results are comparable to the Eact obtained for PCBs\n[see Axelman and Gustafsson, 2002]. It should be noted that\nthe available database for OH radical reactions of PCDD\/Fs\nis based on few measurements of lower chlorinated\ncongeners, and has been extrapolated to the higher\nchlorinated compounds [Atkinson, 1996]. The situation is\ncomparable for PCBs, where recent field evidence broadly\nTable 1.

Calculations were\nalways performed per homologue group (i.e., combining all\nPCDD\/Fs into groups with the same number of chlorines),\nand then combined to SCl4\u20138DD\/Fs. Atmospheric emis-\nsions were assumed to be constant throughout the year.\n[18] Here 1998 was chosen as a reference year for the\ncalculations for better comparison of the results: Numerous\nambient PCDD\/F concentrations were measured that year,\nnotably the Atlantic transect data [Lohmann et al., 2001]\nwhich was used to estimate the oceanic sink of PCDD\/Fs\n[Dachs et al., 2002].\n2.3. Other Loss Processes\n[19] Photolysis of PCDD\/Fs in the gas phase was not\ntaken into account, due to a paucity of data [see Atkinson,\n1996; Lohmann and Jones, 1998]. The role of vegetation in\nremoving and destroying PCDD\/Fs from the atmosphere is\nat present uncertain [Niu et al., 2003; Dalla Valle et al.,\n2004]. At least for PAHs, research has shown the impor-\ntance of degradation reaction on the surface of leaves and\nthe possibility of metabolism inside the stomata [Wild et al.,\n2005a, 2005b]. It is unclear if vegetation is also important\nfor the chlorinated, more recalcitrant compounds like OC\npesticides, PCBs and PCDD\/Fs; future research would be\nneeded to address these questions.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. Terrestrial Sink\n[20] Brzuzy and Hites [1996] published the first global\ndeposition estimate for PCDD\/Fs. On the basis of over\n100 soil samples, the global flux of SCl4\u20138DD\/Fs to soils\nwas estimated to be 12,500 \u00b1 1300 kg\/yr. Fluxes were\napportioned to different climate zones, with depositions to\ntemperate soils (\u00016900 kg\/yr) dominating the global depo-\nsitional fluxes (Table 2). The derived deposition fluxes were\ncalculated as the mean annual deposition over 60 years,\nuntil 1994. Numerous studies have shown a drastic decrease\nin ambient PCDD\/F concentrations and their deposition in\nindustrialized countries in the 1990s [e.g., Alcock et al.,\n1999; Alcock and Jones, 1996; Baker and Hites, 2000b;\nHiester et al., 1997]. For example, the average deposition of\nSCl4\u20138DD\/Fs to Lake Siskiwit in Lake Superior (USA)\ndecreased by 50% from the mean flux for 1935\u20131994 to\n1998 (see Figure 2). The depositional flux in the temperate\nlatitudes, thought to be dominated by European and North\nAmerican emissions, was therefore reduced by (1) 50%\nacross the homologue groups or (2) the mean decrease as\nmeasured in Lake Siskiwit (from \u000130% for OCDD to\n> 90% for Cl4\/5DDs), which is taken to be representative\nfor the whole US and Europe. There are no data available to\njustify a reduction of PCDD\/Fs fluxes outside North America\nand Europe; hence the estimates were kept the same.\nEstimated depositional fluxes to the temperate environment\nin 1998 were in between 4800 kg\/yr (based on the mean\nU.S. decrease) or 3400 kg\/yr (based on a 50% decrease for\nall homologue groups).\n[21] This resulted in a reduction of the global terrestrial\ndeposition flux by \u000120\u201330% (from 12,500 kg\/yr to\n\u00019100\u201310,400 kg\/yr). Hence we suggest for 1998 that the\nbest estimate of the global depositional flux of PCDD\/Fs to\nsoils is of the order of 9100\u201310,400 kg SCl4\u20138DD\/Fs\/yr\n(Table 2). The majority of that depositional flux was due to\nCl7DDs (1500\u20131800 kg\/yr) and OCDD (4800\u20135900 kg\/yr).\n3.2. Predicted PCDD\/F Gas-Particle Distributions\n[22] Varying gas-particle distributions were calculated as\na function of [TSP] and T. The particle-bound fraction F\nwas calculated based on a correlation by Finizio et al.\n[1997] between the gas-particle partitioning coefficient,\nKp, and that between octanol and air, Koa. F was calculated\nbased on the observed Kp value and [TSP]:\nF \u00bc KP TSP\u00bd \n=KP TSP\u00bd \n \u00fe 1 \u00f03\u00de\n[23] Kp is defined as the ratio of the compounds\u2019 partic-\nulate (F) and the gaseous concentrations (A), normalized to\n[TSP] (in mg\/m3). The predicted [TSP] thus enables the\ncalculation of gaseous and particulate fractions. The T\ndependency of the gas-particle partitioning was accounted\nfor by calculating Koa of the different PCDD\/Fs at temper-\nature T (Koa(T)) relative to Koa at 298 K (Koa(298)) [Harner\net al., 2000]:\nLog Koa T\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc A\u00fe B=T logKoa 298\u00f0 \u00de \u00f04\u00de\nTable 2.

However, both PAHs and PCDD\/Fs are planar\ncompounds, originate mainly from combustion processes\nand show enhanced affinities for carbonaceous surfaces.\nHence a comparable atmospheric partitioning between gas-\neous and particulate phase can be expected:\nLog Kp \u00bc 0:79 logKoa \u0005 10:01 \u00f05\u00de\n[25] There is ongoing debate on the exact mechanisms\n(i.e., absorption into the organic carbon, adsorption onto the\nexterior surface of black carbon or a combination of both)\ngoverning the gas-particle distributions of semivolatile\norganic compounds, such as PAHs or PCDD\/Fs [e.g.,\nLohmann and Lammel, 2004]. Because of the paucity of\ndata, especially for PCDD\/Fs, and questions pertaining to\nthe quality of gas-particle distributions from field measure-\nments [e.g., Mader and Pankow, 2000, 2001a, 2001b,\n2002], it was decided to use a correlation that was based\non measurements for a wider range of organic compounds,\nwithout an explicit assumption on the nature of the affinity\nfor the aerosols in question.\n[26] PCDD\/Fs on particles were assumed not to react with\nOH radicals. This was inferred from studies showing a\nreduced reactivity of PAHs on carbonaceous particles\n(1) with OH and NO2 radicals [Esteve et al., 2004, 2006]\nand (2) in photolysis experiments [Behymer and Hites,\n1988]. Hence we assume that the averaged \u2018\u2018aged\u2019\u2019 particle\nwill effectively shield PCDD\/Fs from OH radicals, possibly\ndue to an outer ring made of secondary organic aerosols,\nand different salts [see also Lohmann and Lammel, 2004].\n3.3. Predicted Particulate Fraction (F) of PCDD\/Fs\n[27] F varied both with latitude (i.e., T and [TSP]) and\nhomologue groups. The relative spatial and temporal trends\nof F were constant for the various PCDD\/F homologue\ngroups: Lowest F were predicted from 25\u0001S to the equator\nfrom October to June. Conversely, highest F were predicted\nfor 34\u0001N to \u000175\u0001N from October to June, with some high\nvalues of F around 60\u0001S and near 90\u0001S during May to\nSeptember. F increased within the homologue groups with\nincreasing degree of chlorination, with PCDFs having\nslightly lower values of F for the same number of chlorines\nattached. This predicted behavior can be explained by the\ndecrease in volatility with an increasing number of chlorines\nattached and has regularly been observed in field studies\n[see Lohmann and Jones, 1998].\n[28] The predicted F between 0 and 2 km for Cl4DDs\nranged from 0.03 (near equator) to > 0.30 (35\u0001N to 75\u0001N),\nwith values around 0.25 around 57\u0001S. For Cl5DDs, mini-\nmum values of F were 0.07, with highest values of > 0.60 in\nthe NH. F for Cl6DDs ranged from < 0.20 to > 0.80 and for\nCl7DDs from < 0.50 to > 0.90. OCDD was predicted to\nhave F of at least 0.70 near the equator to values close to\n100% in the NH. Predicted F for PCDFs were in generally\nlower by ca 0.05 compared to those for PCDDs. Between\n2 and 10 km predicted F for all homologue groups were\nhigher, indicating that the decrease in [TSP] (which would\nresult in a decrease in F) was outweighed by the decrease of\ntemperature and its effect of increasing Koa values. The\nincrease in predicted F was nonlinear, i.e., more pro-\nnounced in colder regions and those with higher [TSP].\nFor example, for Cl4DDs, predicted F reached > 0.50\nfor north of 40\u0001N for most of the year, with predicted\nF < 0.10 within a narrow region south of the equator for\nmost of the year. For Cl5DDs, F > 0.75 were predicted north\nof 40\u0001N and south of 80\u0001S for most of the year, with\nminimum values of \u00010.15 near the equator. For Cl6DDs,\nF > 0.90 were predicted north of 40\u0001N and south of 80\u0001S,\nwith lowest values of F of around 0.40 in between 5\u0001S and\n30\u0001S during March to June. During those months, F < 0.75\nand \u00010.90 were predicted near the equator for Cl7DDs and\nOCDD, respectively.\nFigure 2. Annual deposition of SCl4\u20138DD\/Fs to Lake Siskiwit.

Predicted Versus Measured Particulate Fractions\n[29] The following studies were selected which deter-\nmined actual gas-particle distributions in coastal\/rural or\nremote environments: (1) results from rural Lancaster (UK,\n54\u0001N), taken in November\/December 1998 [Lohmann et al.,\n2000], (2) annual means from rural Bayreuth (Germany,\n52\u0001N), taken in 1995 [Hippelein et al., 1996], (3) results\nfrom coastal Sandy Hook (NJ, USA, 40\u0001N), take in June\n1998 (R. Lohmann et al., Assessing the importance of ab- and\nadsorption to the gas-particle partitioning of PCDD\/Fs, with\na case study in the New Jersey urban atmosphere, submitted\nto Atmospheric Environment, 2006, hereinafter referred to\nas Lohmann et al., submitted manuscript, 2006), (4) results\nfrom a trans-Atlantic cruise from England (53\u0001N) to the\nAntarctic (74\u0001S), taken from October to December 1998\n[Lohmann et al., 2001], (5) the annual mean from Barbados\n(13\u0001N) in 1996\/1997 and Bermuda (32\u0001N) in 1993\/1994\n[Baker and Hites, 1999], and (6) annual mean from rural\nBloomington, determined in 1986 (40\u0001N, USA) [Eitzer and\nHites, 1989]. A comparison of predicted (mean 0\u20132 km)\nand measured (near ground) land-based particulate fractions\n(f) showed good agreement (Figure 3).\n[30] For example, for Cl5DDs at Lancaster (UK, 54\u0001N) in\nNovember\/December, Fs of 57\u201362% were predicted, and\nFs ranging from 44 to 99% were measured [Lohmann et al.,\n2001]; at the New Jersey coast (USA, 40\u0001N) in June\/July,\nFs of 38\u201347% were predicted, and Fs ranging from 25 to\n60% were measured (Lohmann et al., submitted manuscript,\n2006). These trends can be seen for all land-based stations.\nF determined in Barbados and Bermudas (13 and 32\u0001N,\nUSA) were below the predicted values, though the long\nsampling duration might have affected the measured dis-\ntributions. On the contrary, results for Lancaster tended to\nbe above the predicted values, but the samples taken were\nnot representative for the winter season. Instead rather cold\nspells were targeted, to minimize the temperature fluctua-\ntion during the 24-hour sampling periods [Lohmann et al.,\n2000]. Most importantly, the comparison with the gas-\nparticle distribution as determined on a trans-Atlantic cruise\nshowed the mean value close to the predicted one [Lohmann\net al., 2001] for all homologue groups (Figure 3): for\nCl4DDs, predicted was 12% (range 4\u201325%), and measured\n17% \u00b1 18% (\u00b11 standard deviation), for Cl5DDs, predicted\nwere 28% (12\u201351%), measured were 41% \u00b1 30% and\nfinally for Cl6DDs, predicted were 54% (30\u201376%), mea-\nsured were 46% \u00b1 33%.\n3.5. Atmospheric Loss Over Terrestrial Environment\n[31] The atmospheric OH radical depletion over the\nterrestrial environment was calculated based on the relative\nOH radical reaction rates [Baker and Hites, 2000a], relating\nthe amount deposited (SD) to the amount emitted (SE)\nthrough a combination of particulate deposition and gas-\neous depletion. Atmospheric deposition was described\nthrough a single settling velocity (kD) for the particle-bound\nfraction (f), and atmospheric depletion through a pseudo-\nfirst-order OH radical reaction constant (k\u2019OH) for the\ngaseous PCDD\/Fs (1\u0005f). For the terrestrial environment,\nthe total amount deposited (SD, terre.) is known through the\ndetailed study by [Brzuzy and Hites, 1996]. The total\namount depleted (Sdepl, terre.) over the terrestrial environment\ncan be calculated assuming that PCDD\/Fs detected in the\nremote soil samples arrived exclusively through atmospheric\ndeposition, with gaseous depletion through OH radicals\nbeing the only other loss process limiting their deposition.\nSdepl;terre: \u00bc SD;terr: k\n0\nOH 1\u0005 f\u00f0 \u00de\nkDf\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u00f06\u00de\n3.5.1. Scenario A: One-Box Atmosphere Model\n(Constant T, [OH], and Gas-Particle Partitioning)\n[32] This approach follows Brubaker and Hites [1997]\nand Baker and Hites [2000a] by assuming a globally\nconstant [OH] of 9.7 \u0002 105 molecules\/cm3, a constant T\n(298K) and a universal gas-particle partitioning of PCDD\/\nFs as determined at Bloomington [Eitzer and Hites, 1989].\nOH radical depletion was calculated to be a major sink for\nCl4DDs and Cl4DFs: Less than 20% were calculated to\ndeposit onto soils (120 and 540 kg\/yr), with the majority\nbeing degraded in the atmosphere (400\u2013500 and 1700\u2013\n1900 kg\/yr, respectively). For Cl5DD\/Fs, OH radical deple-\ntion was already far less important, with at most a third\nreacting in the atmosphere. Slow atmospheric reactions\ntimes for gaseous Cl7\u20138DD\/Fs, coupled with their prepon-\nderance on particles, rendered atmospheric loss processes\nfor these compounds negligible. In total, the atmospheric\nsink over the terrestrial environments was calculated to be\non the order of 2400\u20132800 kg\/yr for SCl4\u20138DD\/Fs, most of\nwhich was due to Cl4DFs and Cl4DDs (Table 3). A\nbreakdown of the importance of OH radical depletion shows\na roughly equal importance of subtropical (\u0001650 kg\/yr),\npolar\/boreal (\u0001610 kg\/yr) and tropical zones (\u0001560 kg\/yr).\nThe estimation for the temperate zone depended strongly on\nthe scenario assumed for the recent decrease. Taking the\nobserved decrease, the atmospheric sink term was rather\nsmall (\u0001160 kg\/yr), while assuming a general 50% decrease\nfor all congeners resulted in a much higher atmospheric sink\n(\u0001570 kg\/yr). This reflects the disproportionate decrease of\nthe Cl4DD\/Fs compared to the total PCDD\/F depositional\nflux.\n3.5.2. Scenario B: Multibox Atmosphere Model\n(Variable T, [OH], [TSP], and Gas-Particle Partitioning)\n[33] In a second, more refined approach, OH radical\ndepletion was calculated as a function of globally modeled\nmonthly OH radical concentrations at the respective ambi-\nent temperature. The gas-particle partitioning was calculated\nas a function of T and [TSP] (see above). No depletion of\nPCDD\/Fs occurred in the particulate phase. Atmospheric\ndepletion versus deposition factors were averaged over the\nrange of latitudes best representing the climatic zones and\ntheir spatial coverage (Table 4).\n[34] The soil climatic zones were placed in the atmo-\nspheric circulation pattern in which the majority was found:\nthe polar\/boreal zone between 60\u0001N and 90\u0001N (polar\ncell), the temperate zone between 30\u0001N and 60\u0001N (Ferrel\ncell), the subtropical zone between 0\u0001N and 30\u0001N covering\nthe northern branch of the Hadley cell, the tropical zone in\nthe 60\u0001S\u201330\u0001N zone, and the arid zone again in the 0\u0001\u2013\n30\u0001N cell. The differences between the arid and the sub-\ntropical zone are based on their different PCD\/F content in\nthe soils, while the atmospheric chemistry is the same.\nAtmospheric transport in these zones is fast longitudinally,\nso well-mixed FCDD\/F concentrations can be assumed both\nhorizontally and across the zone. However, the latitudinal\nD21303 LOHMANN ET AL.: ATMOSPHERIC SINK FOR PCDD\/FS\n6 of 11\nD21303\nFigure 3.

The\nstrength of the atmospheric sink of PCDD\/Fs was on the\norder of 2100 kg\/yr, as compared to 2400\u20132800 kg\/yr by\nthe \u2018\u2018one-box atmosphere\u2019\u2019 model. However, major shifts\nwere apparent in the regions in which PCDD\/Fs were\ndepleted in the atmosphere. The \u2018\u2018one-box atmosphere\u2019\u2019\nmodel showed similarly high loss fluxes for subtropical,\npolar\/boreal, tropical and temperate climate zones. In the\n\u2018\u2018multibox\u2019\u2019 atmosphere with different T, [OH], and [TSP],\nthe atmospheric depletion of PCDD\/Fs was concentrated in\nthe subtropical (810 kg\/yr), tropical (710 kg\/yr) and to some\ndegree arid zones (440 kg\/yr). Lower temperatures and\nhigher [TSP] combined to decrease the gas-phase atmo-\nspheric depletion over the temperate and polar\/boreal\nregions (with effects on both the reaction rates and the\ngas-particle distribution). The majority of the atmospheric\ndepletion was still due to the depletion of Cl4DFs (1300\u2013\n1400 kg\/yr), followed by Cl4DDs (360\u2013380 kg\/yr) and\nCl5DFs (230\u2013240 kg\/yr). Thus the different assumptions\nregarding the terrestrial deposition flux of PCDD\/Fs to the\ntemperate environment were less important in this scenario.\n3.5.3. Scenario C: Multibox Atmosphere Model,\nVariable Particle Lifetime\n[36] The biggest uncertainty regarding the atmospheric\nsink was rather in the actual value of the particle life time\n(affecting the relative rate of deposition versus [OH] deple-\ntion). On average, particle life time is \u00011 week in the lower\nTable 3.

To give a better estimation of the range of the\natmospheric sink term two values covering the range of\nparticle life times (4 and 14 days) were chosen (Table 5).\nThe range given by these different settling velocities varied\nthe strength of the OH radical depletion of PCDD\/Fs from\n\u00011600 kg\/yr for fast settling particles to \u00012800 kg\/yr for\nthe slower particle settling velocity. Recent results from the\naerosol climate model ECHAM5-HAM developed at the\nMax-Planck-Institute of Meteorology suggest on average\nlifetimes of 5.4 days for both organic and black carbon\n[Stier et al., 2005], which was in good agreement with other\npredictions. Using a particle lifetime of 5.4 days, the\natmospheric sink of PCDD\/Fs was just under 2000 kg\/yr\n(1800\u20131900 kg\/yr). In summary, based on a particle life\ntime of 8 days, the strength of the atmospheric sink of\nPCDD\/Fs is estimated to be on the order of \u00012,100 kg.\nDiffering particle life times affect that mean value by\nroughly a third (1600\u20132800 kg\/yr).\n[37] So far we have estimated the fate of OH radical\ndepleted PCDD\/Fs based on their depositional flux to the\nterrestrial environment. It is evident from inspecting the\ndeposition velocities used here that some fraction of atmo-\nspheric PCDD\/Fs will be transported across the oceans and\ndeposited there; and this has indeed been observed [e.g.,\nBaker and Hites, 1999; Hung et al., 2002; Lohmann et al.,\n2001]. Following the logic used above, for every fraction of\nPCDD\/Fs deposited to the global oceans, a corresponding\nfraction will have been depleted in the atmosphere. This will\nadd to the atmospheric depletion fluxes derived above for\nthe deposition to the terrestrial soils. However, no measured\ndata exist for the settling fluxes of PCDD\/Fs to sediments or\nthe deep water in the oceans.\n3.6. Atmospheric Loss Over Oceans\n[38] The atmospheric deposition fluxes of PCDD\/Fs over\nthe oceans were calculated based on the measured transect\ndata of PCDD\/Fs over the Atlantic (for details, see Jurado\net al. [2004, 2005]). Highest atmospheric concentrations of\nCl2\u20138DD\/Fs all occurred between 25 and 52\u0001N; lowest\nconcentrations were measured around \u000160\u0001S and further\nsouth. In these calculations, extrapolated to the global scale,\ntotal deposition to the oceans accounted for \u000116,000 kg\/yr,\ndominated by wet deposition (\u000110,000 kg\/yr), followed by\ngas phase uptake by the oceans (\u00013500 kg\/yr), and dry\ndeposition (\u00012800 kg\/yr). As these calculations were based\non single point measurements extrapolated to the world\u2019s\noceans, the uncertainty of the resulting PCDD\/F deposition\nflux is rather high, around a factor of 3. Nonetheless, the\ncalculated oceanic settling fluxes of PCDD\/Fs suggest that\nthe total PCDD\/F deposition to the world\u2019s oceans could\nmatch their deposition to terrestrial soils.\n[39] It is appropriate to consider how representative the\natmospheric Atlantic concentrations measured in this study\nare for other locations of similar latitude. Baker and Hites\n[1999] measured PCDD\/Fs on Bermudas and Barbados from\nthe clean, \u2018\u2018eastern\u2019\u2019 sector, and reported PCDD\/F concen-\ntrations which were on average lower by a factor of 5 than\nthose reported by Lohmann et al. [2001]. Assuming both\nmeasurements were correct, this suggests that (1) PCDD\/Fs\ndo indeed travel long distances over water, (2) Baker and\nHites [1999] likely underestimated the \u2018\u2018true\u2019\u2019 deposition of\nPCDD\/Fs, at least to the North Atlantic Ocean, as PCDD\/Fs\nhad to undergo deposition, depletion, and air-water exchange\nprocesses before reaching their sampler near the American\ncoast, and (3) global atmospheric background concentrations\nwill lie in between these two data sets. We are not aware of\npublished PCDD\/F measurements over the Pacific or Indian\nOcean.\n4. Conclusion and Outlook\n[40] A comparison of the different sink strength and\nhomologue profiles shows the dominance of terrestrial soils\nand oceans as sinks for most PCDD\/Fs (Figure 4). For\nCl6\u20138DDs, deposition to soils outweighs depletion reactions\nin the atmosphere and ocean uptake. It is suggested that for\nCl6\u20138DFs, deposition to the oceans is their major global\nsink. The more volatile Cl4\u20135DD\/Fs, however, are true\n\u2018\u2018multimedia\u2019\u2019 compounds, with their estimated atmospheric\nsink being roughly as important as the terrestrial sink (in the\ncase of Cl5DD\/Fs), or outweighing it (e.g., Cl4DD\/Fs).\nThese tetrachlorinated and pentachlorinated homologue\ngroups are calculated to have a strong gas-to-water uptake\nby oceans. As a direct consequence, it is suggested that\nattempts to establish global mass balances for PCDD\/Fs\nhave to consider atmospheric loss processes and uptake by\noceans. For 1998, we estimate the importance of the\natmospheric sink to be on the order of \u00012100 kg\/yr, based\nTable 5.

Depending\non the magnitude of the PCDD\/Fs settling and gas uptake\nfluxes to oceans, the atmospheric sink calculations per-\nformed here could be twice as high.\n[41] Estimated global PCDD\/F emissions needed to be on\nthe order of 12,000 kg SCl4\u20138DD\/Fs\/yr in 1998, solely to\nbalance the deposition to terrestrial soils and the\ncorresponding atmospheric depletion calculated here. In\naddition, deposition and gas uptake to the global oceans\nand their corresponding atmospheric depletion reactions\ncould add up to another 18,000 kg SCl4 \u2013 8DD\/Fs\/yr\n(Figure 4).\n[42] It is interesting to compare the global fate of PCDD\/\nFs summarized here with work carried out for PCBs. For\nexample, Mandalakis et al. [2005] derived a mass balance\nfor PCBs in the eastern Mediterranean, and argued that\natmospheric depletion was the biggest removal mechanism\nof PCBs (\u00016700 kg\/yr), much more important than wet and\ndry deposition (together \u00011600 kg\/yr) or deep-sea settling\n(\u0001300 kg\/yr). The importance of the atmospheric depletion\nof PCBs in the Mediterranean does not contradict the results\nof our study. The fraction of particle-bound PCBs has been\nobserved to be lower than for PCDD\/Fs of similar Koa [e.g.,\nLohmann et al., 2000], resulting in higher depletion reac-\ntions in their study. Furthermore, in contrast to our study\ntheir study region did not include terrestrial soils, which are\nconsidered one of the main PCB reservoirs.\n[43] Global PCDD\/F emissions were derived through\nemission inventories. Brzuzy and Hites [1996] calculated\nemissions on the order of 3,000 kg\/yr (certain within a factor\nof 3). Later research suggested that the preponderance of\nOCDD, and other Cl6\u20138DD\/Fs can be explained by their\natmospheric condensation reaction from pentachlorophenol\n[Baker and Hites, 2000a]. A global emission inventory\nbased on adding up national emission inventories is currently\nundertaken by the UN EP. On the basis of a few countries,\nthese added up to a few thousand kg SCl4\u20138DD\/Fs\/yr in\n1999 [UNEP, 1999]. In light of the binding commitment of\nthe international community to decrease emissions of\nPCDD\/Fs, it seems certain that additional PCDD\/F emis-\nsions exist, beyond those accounted for in the national\nemission inventories.\nReferences\nAlcock, R.
