It has been argued that\n`\u00aefteenth-century England did not operate as a political unit but as a\nseries of political contexts, each with its own problems and rules'. These\nfour arenas of politics, it has been suggested, were landed politics, court\npolitics, the politics of government and popular politics.3 It is important,\nhowever, to ask \u00b1 and it is a question that political historians of late\nmedieval England, with their overriding interest in landed society, have\n* I would like to thank Mark Ormrod, Chris Dyer, Caroline Barron and Nicola McDonald,\nas well as the two anonymous reviewers, for their helpful comments on earlier versions of\nthis article.\n1 C.

In\nparticular, if one of the keys to understanding `how society and politics\nactually worked' lies in the interaction of local and national politics,4 it is\nalso worth examining the extent to which the relationship between\nurban communities and the crown occupied a \u00aefth political arena, with a\nseparate language, agenda and tensions. This article identi\u00aees a ne-\nglected element in the political discourse of late medieval England: the\nrhetoric of crown-town relations, in particular that based upon the\nmetaphor of the royal chamber.\nAlthough London's claims to be the `king's chamber' have received\nsome attention from historians, few have done more than refer to them\nin passing.5 This article will examine \u00aerst the emergence of the metaphor\nof the chamber in the early fourteenth century and the way in which the\nidea of London as the `king's chamber' was embellished in the reign of\nRichard II, before considering the aspirations of other cities to assume a\nsimilar distinction. In the late fourteenth century the city of York asserted\nits claim to be the `king's chamber' in direct imitation of London, whilst\nin the second half of the \u00aefteenth century Coventry began to present\nitself, on the occasion of royal visits to the city, as the `prince's chamber'.\nThis article will show how the chamber was a powerful metaphor which\nLondon, York and Coventry appropriated to articulate and re-negotiate\ntheir relations with the crown at times of acute political tension.\nSigni\u00aecantly, their status as royal chambers was not formalized in any\ninstitutional sense and the metaphor was not sustained. If the metaphor\nwas important in allowing a city to gain the attention, or declare its\nsupport, of the royal government, one of the interesting questions, then,\nis why the chamber remained an occasional rhetorical device to which\nLondon, York and Coventry had recourse only at certain critical\nmoments.\nAnother issue is whether the chamber can provide a conceptual frame-\nwork in which relations between urban communities and the crown in\nlate medieval England might be located. It has been argued that, in the\ncase of London, the city's relationship with the royal government was\nbased essentially on the interplay of `\u00aenance' and `privilege', whereby\nthe crown's \u00aenancial need on the one hand was balanced by the city's\nconcern for its privileges on the other.6 How far did the metaphor of the\n4 R.

Gervase Rosser has argued that urban\nmyths and symbols had no single \u00aexed meaning, but rather that they\ncould be continually adapted and applied to changing political circum-\nstances and represented a `contested territory' in which internal debates\nabout a town's identity could be conducted.8 Through a close reading of\nthe particular contexts in which the metaphor of the chamber was used,\nit will be argued that the chamber had a range of possible connotations,\nmeaning different things at different times. The chamber deserves\nattention because, whilst in essence it articulated relations between\nurban communities and the crown, it also came to express relations\nbetween, and within, cities, from the fourteenth to the seventeenth\ncenturies.\nLondon: the `king's chamber'\nStudents of medieval literature have long been aware of the use of\nbuilding images in texts such as The Castle of Perseverance or Chaucer's\nHouse of Fame to represent certain abstract qualities or ideas,9 but the\nchamber was a different kind of architectural symbol in that it was not\nin\u00afuenced by either biblical or classical tradition. It was part of a wider\narchitectural vocabulary which cities employed in the late Middle Ages\nto describe themselves. In 1387, for example, London's civic elite referred\nto their city as the `watch-tower of the whole realm', whilst in the 1450s\nCoventry was called `the Queen's secret harbour', in reference to the\nfrequent visits to the city of Queen Margaret of Anjou.10 What, then, was\nthe particular signi\u00aecance of the royal chamber? The symbolism derived\nfrom the position of the king's chamber in the structure of royal\nprovincial towns', in S.K. Cohn Jr and S.A. Epstein (eds), Portraits of Medieval and\nRenaissance Living: Essays in Memory of David Herlihy (Michigan, 1996), 336\u00b18.\n7 For example, G.

By the twelfth century the king's chamber had two prin-\ncipal meanings. First, it was the king's bedchamber, in Chris Given-\nWilson's words, `the inner, private sanctum' of the household, in which\nthe king `dressed, bathed, slept, and often dined or worked away from\nthe hubbub of the household, closeted in privacy with a small inner\ncircle of friends and counsellors'; and second, it was the king's privy\npurse, a \u00aenancial of\u00aece with responsibility for the payment of the king's\npersonal expenses which included jewels and plate, books, paintings\nand gifts for his friends.11\nIn the late thirteenth to early fourteenth centuries the chamber\nacquired greater signi\u00aecance. On the one hand, this period saw an\narchitectural shift in the relationship between the hall and the chamber,\nwith the decline of the hall and the corresponding rise in importance of\nthe chamber.12 Although the extent of the hall's decline should not be\nexaggerated,13 it would appear that by the mid-fourteenth century the\nchamber had emerged as the focus of the social and political activity of\nthe aristocratic and royal household. The impression from Langland's\nPiers Plowman is that the wealthy were withdrawing from the hall into\nthe private and privileged space of the chamber to eat and entertain\nseparately from the rest of the household:\nElenge is the halle, ech day in the wike,\nTher the lord ne the lady liketh noght to sitte.\nNow hath ech riche a rule \u00b1 to eten by hymselve\nIn a pryvee parlour for povere mennes sake,\nOr in a chambre with a chymenee, and leve the chief halle\nThat was maad for meles, men to eten inne,\nAnd al to spare to spille that spende shal another.14\nIn the course of the fourteenth century the royal residences of Windsor\nand Eltham saw the construction of a `multiplicity of chambers' and in\nthese rooms, as Given-Wilson has argued, `more things were now done\n. . . more eating, more discussion, more leisure activities'.15 On the other\nhand, the king's chamber became more important in royal administra-\ntion under Edward II, gaining new functions and acquiring a greater\nsense of its own corporate identity, with a permanent staff and an\nincome of its own.16 Although historians have questioned more recently\nthe extent of Edward II's dependence on the chamber as an instrument\n11 C.

On Fenchurch Arch, the \u00aerst of the seven arches\nthrough which the new king was to journey, were the words, `Londi-\nnium: Camera Regia', `which title', according to Jonson's explanatory\nnotes, `immediately after the Norman conquest it [London] began to\nhave; and by the indulgence of succeeding princes, hath been hitherto\ncontinued'.19 Unfortunately, Camden did not provide a reference to\nsubstantiate his assertion. His belief that London possessed a formal title\nof `king's chamber' and that it had enjoyed this title from the arrival of\nthe Normans must be seen as part of a wider interest at this time among\nLondon chroniclers and historians in the continuity of civic traditions.20\nIn fact, the \u00aerst documented reference to London as the `king's chamber'\nseems to date only from 1328, a chronology which coincides, signi\u00ae-\ncantly, with the increasing architectural, administrative and political\nprominence of the king's chamber.\nOn 16 December 1328 Edward III wrote to the mayor, aldermen,\nsheriffs and commonalty of London, requesting the city's support for the\ncause of Mortimer and Isabella against a party led by the Earl of\nLancaster in a con\u00afict provoked by the arbitrary actions of Mortimer.21\nThe letter ordered that Lancaster's supporters should not \u00aend favour in\n17 The quotation is from ibid., 314.

A.H. Thomas (Cambridge,\n1926), 77\u00b18.\nThe rhetoric of the royal chamber 327\nthe city, `which we consider our chamber'. To understand the meaning of\nLondon's designation as the `king's chamber', this letter needs to be\nlocated within the broader context of London's relations with the crown\nin the period. Although in the \u00aerst instance, London had bene\u00aeted\ngreatly from the regime of Mortimer and Isabella, receiving a whole\npackage of concessions, including the 1327 charter, which increased\nsubstantially the city's corporate liberties, it was not long before Mor-\ntimer began to act in the same arbitrary way that the Despensers had\ndone.22 London's mayor, Hamo de Chigwell, was a leading \u00aegure in the\nopposition to Mortimer and in September 1328, at the guildhall, he met,\namong others, John Stratford, Bishop of Winchester, and secured an\nagreement to seek redress of the country's ills in the next parliament.23\nThe government of Mortimer and Isabella was told of the meeting and\nwrote immediately to the mayor, who tried unsuccessfully to dampen\nsuspicions of a conspiracy. London's Lancastrian sympathies were\nalready in evidence, for a London contingent of men-at-arms, led by the\nmayor's brother, Thomas de Chigwell, had joined Lancaster on Strat-\nford's departure from the capital and had participated in the assault on\nWinchester, where they rallied supporters. In November 1328 the king\nsummoned before him an embassy of twelve leading citizens at Windsor,\nwho sought to disassociate themselves from the actions of a group of\nLondoners at Winchester by claiming that they had acted without their\nknowledge or consent. That the regime of Mortimer and Isabella was still\nnot convinced of London's loyalty is made clear by the letter of\nDecember 1328.\nThis letter, described by Gwyn A. Williams as `an unprecedented\nexercise in public relations' by the crown,24 is certainly extraordinary.\nAccompanying the letter was a copy of a missive sent to the Earl of\nLancaster providing a complete narrative account of the con\u00afict from the\ncrown's perspective and refuting, point by point, all of Lancaster's\nobjections.25 The letter was to be proclaimed publicly in London `so that\neveryone should see openly that we have done all that be\u00aets us and so\nthat no fault can be ascribed to us'. `Never before', according to Williams,\n`had such intimate detail of high policy been so bandied about the\nmarket place.' As we have seen, the crown's position was vulnerable in\n1328; but why was London's support viewed as so crucial to the survival\nof the government of Mortimer and Isabella? There is no doubt that the\nauthor of the letter was conscious of the events of 1326\u00b127 when London\nhad been instrumental in Edward II's downfall. London's role in the\noverthrow of Edward II's government is well attested: hearing of the\n22 For the charter, see G.A. Williams, Medieval London: From Commune to Capital (London,\n1963), 298\u00b19.\n23 The remainder of this paragraph draws heavily on ibid., 301\u00b12.\n24 This and the subsequent quotation from Williams are in ibid., 303.\n25 The letter to the Earl of Lancaster was copied into the city records: Calendar of Plea and\nMemoranda Rolls, 1323\u00b11364, 78\u00b183.\n328 Urban History\ninvasion by Mortimer and Isabella, Edward and the Despensers clearly\nfelt insecure in the capital and abandoned the city in September 1326 for\nWales; in October the city revolted in support of the invasion, attacking\nthe property of those associated with Edward II's government, most\nnotably the estates of the Despensers, and murdering the king's treas-\nurer, Bishop Stapeldon; and in January 1327 it was in London that oaths\nwere sworn to the new regime in the city's guildhall and it was the\nLondoners who provided the popular acclamation in Westminster Hall\nwhich greeted the announcement of Edward II's deposition.26 The letter\nof 16 December 1328, ostensibly from Edward III, expressed Mortimer\nand Isabella's fears that London's support for the Earl of Lancaster's\ncause could topple their government, just as it had helped to bring them\nto power. London's rulers were reminded of the \u00aedelity and loyalty\nwhich they owed the king and were instructed not to show favour to\nLancaster's followers or even to allow them to enter the city. In fact, if\nLancaster's supporters approached the city, the Londoners, `as our good\npeople in whom we trust', were instructed to do whatever it took,\n`beyond that which the law requires', in order to preserve the honour\nand status of the crown.\nThe letter to London appealed to the citizens' support as the king's\nloyal subjects and alluded to a special relationship between the crown\nand the city, expressing this relationship in terms of the metaphor of the\nchamber. In this instance the chamber appears to have had four connota-\ntions, which grew directly out of the role and signi\u00aecance of the chamber\nin royal government. The \u00aerst was \u00aenancial service to the king. The letter\nrequested repeatedly that Lancaster's supporters should not be allowed\nto \u00aend `favour' in the city; although exactly what form of assistance is\nnot stated explicitly, given that London had previously provided a\nretinue of men-at-arms for Lancaster's cause, `favour' can be interpreted\nas \u00aenancial or material service. What was implied in the letter was that,\nif London was to give support to anyone, it was to be to the crown.\nSecond, the idea of London as the `king's chamber' had a spatial\ndimension. Just as the chamber, in an architectural sense, was a private\nspace, so the city was the king's own personal residence into which the\nLancastrian followers should not be allowed to enter. Third, the king\nexpected order and peace from London. In the same way that his\nchamber provided him with a peaceful and orderly environment sepa-\nrate from the noise and commotion of the rest of the household and of\nthe hall, in particular, so the city was to be a protected haven for the\nking, a defence from the disorder and tumult resulting from Lancaster's\n26 M.

Fourth, and more generally, the chamber\nimplied a special relationship and bond between London and the crown.\nIf it was the crown that called upon London as the `king's chamber' at\na time of great danger to royal authority, it is appropriate to ask how and\nwhy the term came to be adopted by the city. According to Thomas\nWalsingham, on 21 June 1377, the day of Edward III's death, London\nsent a delegation of prominent citizens led by John Philpot to Ken-\nnington to visit Richard of Bordeaux, the future king.27 Aware that\nEdward III was in the throes of death, the Londoners acknowledged\nRichard as their new sovereign. Philpot, speaking on behalf of the city,\naddressed Richard and recommended to the prince's grace `our city, that\nis, your chamber', and promised that the citizens would serve him `both\nin word and in deed'.28 Placed in the context not only of Philpot's\naddress as a whole, but also of the crown's foreign policy, especially the\nplanned campaign against France which was to depart from London in\nthe summer of 1377,29 this use of the chamber echoed almost directly its\napplication in 1328. First, there was the idea of \u00aenancial service; in this\ninstance, service in foreign war. Philpot told Richard that, as the king's\nchamber, London was `ready not only to give up its worldly goods, but\nalso, if necessary, its life on your behalf '. Second, there was the sense\nthat London was the king's home. Philpot, for example, expressed the\ncity's concern that Richard had withdrawn his presence from London\nand its hope that as king he would now stay in the capital. Third, Philpot\nassured Richard that his residence in London would be a source of\nprotection and would guarantee `safety and solace'. In short, the\nmetaphor of the chamber expressed the city's desire to cultivate a special\nand intimate relationship with the crown.\nThis relationship was reciprocal and, in the \u00aenal line of his speech, the\npurpose of Philpot's visit to Richard became abundantly clear: London's\nrepresentative asked that the new king settle the con\u00afict which had\nrecently arisen between the city and the Duke of Lancaster. This dispute,\nwhose origins lay in the period immediately following the conclusion of\nthe Good Parliament, centred on the serious threat posed to London's\nliberties by John of Gaunt's attempt to extend the jurisdiction of the royal\nhousehold's court of the marshalsea over the borough of Southwark and\nthe city, thereby challenging directly the powers of London's own\ncourts.30 Despite several efforts to secure peace, the dispute had not been\nresolved by the time of Edward III's death, so with the advent of a new\n27 Chronicon Angliae, 1328\u00b11388, ed.

Through the rhetoric of the chamber Philpot appealed\nskilfully for royal intervention on two grounds. On the one hand, since\nLondon was the king's chamber the implication was that the con\u00afict\nbetween Gaunt and the city was also of personal interest to the king. If\nLondon was `our city, your chamber', the assault on London's liberties\nlaunched by Gaunt was an attack not just on the city, but also on the\nking. On the other hand, as London's repeated promises of support to\nthe crown suggest, the city expected something in return for its service\nas the king's chamber. In his emphasis on service, personal access and\nintimacy Philpot was describing the relationship between London and\nthe crown in courtier terms,31 and just as the language of court politics\nwas about `honour and service, and competition for favour, in\u00afuence,\nand material rewards',32 so London sought favour and reward in return\nfor its \u00aenancial service.\nWords, as Philpot acknowledged, were only important when accom-\npanied by action. The day after the London delegation led by Philpot\nmet Richard at Kennington, a royal deputation was sent to the city\ninforming the citizens that the king promised to show favour to his city\nand its citizens and that he would come to London, as they had\nrequested. At Sheen, the citizens and the Duke of Lancaster were\nreconciled by Richard and the peace was proclaimed publicly at West-\nminster.33 Signi\u00aecantly for the city, the planned extension of the mar-\nshal's jurisdiction in the city was abandoned.34 A few months later, in\nOctober 1377, London ful\u00aelled its promise of \u00aenancial support to\nRichard, providing a corporate loan of \u00a35,000 to the crown as part of the\nEnglish response to a series of French attacks on the south coast of\nEngland, Calais and Aquitaine.35\nLondon's appropriation of the metaphor of the chamber in 1377 must\nalso be viewed in the context of the events of the Good Parliament which\nhad taken place in the previous year. It was in this parliament that the\ncommons attacked Edward III's court and impeached members of the\ncourtier clique including the king's chamberlain, William Latimer.36\nThe theme of the accusations against Latimer was his embezzlement of\nthe king's money through his control of the king's chamber. Perhaps the\nmost serious charge was that Latimer had fraudulently used some of the\nking's own money from his chamber to make a loan of 20,000 marks for\nan expedition to Brittany in 1374 on which he was paid interest of 10,000\n31 A point noted in a different context by Bryant, `Paris and London', 33, n. 103.\n32 Harriss, `Dimensions of politics', 7.\n33 Chronicon Angliae, 147\u00b150, translated in Stow, Annales, 278.\n34 Given-Wilson, Royal Household, 52.\n35 London, Public Record Of\u00aece (hereafter PRO), E401\/528, 10 Oct. 1377, and N.

Holmes, The Good Parliament (Oxford, 1975),\nbut see also Given-Wilson, Royal Household, 146\u00b160.\nThe rhetoric of the royal chamber 331\nmarks by the king for his own personal pro\u00aet.37 That the chamber was\nseen by members of the commons as the `instrument for some of his\n[Latimer's] most shady transactions' is made clear in the accusation that\nthe town of Bristol had paid 10,000 marks to the king for a charter of\nliberties, of which the king had actually received 2,000 marks and\nLatimer the remainder.38 Although this speci\u00aec charge is found only in\nWalsingham's Chronicon Angliae, it is certainly true that Bristol had paid\n600 marks into the king's chamber to secure the 1373 charter which\ngranted the town county status and that the sum was an extraordinarily\nlarge sum of money, even though it was customary for a charter to be\npurchased with a payment into the chamber as a \u00aene for the concessions\ncontained in the grant.39 Whether the accusation was true or not, more\nimportant was the contemporary perception of Latimer's abuse of the\nchamber to the detriment of the king. In this context, the subtext of John\nPhilpot's speech in 1377 was that, if the chamber had failed the old king,\nLondon, as the `king's chamber', would not disappoint the new king and\nwould ful\u00ael all of the responsibilities expected of the royal chamber.\nLondon, by claiming for itself this function, hoped to secure a close\nrelationship with the crown, turning the negative connotations asso-\nciated with the chamber in parliamentary politics to its advantage.\nIn the same way that London's rulers employed the metaphor of the\nchamber to assert the city's special relationship with the royal govern-\nment, so it could also be applied to help repair that relationship when it\nbroke down. In May 1392 Richard II moved the of\u00aeces of state from\nWestminster to York and, one month later, seized London's liberties,\nremoving the mayor and sheriffs from of\u00aece and appointing a royal\nwarden to rule the city on his behalf.40 The reasons for Richard's actions\nwere twofold: the city had stopped lending the king money, and there\nwas a serious state of disorder in the capital.41 By August the king and\nthe city were ready to settle their differences and London's rulers\ndecided to dramatize the reconciliation with a series of pageants to be\nperformed on the king's procession through the city.\nThe reception given to Richard and his queen on 21 August has\nreceived a great deal of scholarly attention, not least because the event\nwas recorded in so much detail by contemporary observers, most\n37 Rotuli Parliamentorum, ed.

It was this conceit which underpinned, and gave\nmeaning to, the imagery invoked in 1392.\nThe royal warden, who met the king at London Bridge to present the\nkeys and sword of the city to Richard as a symbol of the city's\nsubmission to the king's grace, addressed these words to the king:\nWith genuine tears, the city prays unceasingly that the merciful king will return\nto his chamber. Let not the most beautiful walls in the kingdom be rent nor torn,\nfor they are the king's own and whatever is within them. Let not the bridegroom\nhate the bridal chamber which he has always loved. (Concordia, II. 142\u00b16)\nIf the city, as a physical space, was the `bridal chamber' (`thalamus'),\nwhose streets were `beautifully decorated' (Concordia, I. 57) and `fragrant\nwith a kind of sweet-smelling \u00afower' (Concordia, I. 59), the citizens\nthemselves were the `bride' to Richard's `spouse' (Concordia, I. 66),\nwelcoming the return home of her estranged husband. Although doubts\nhave been expressed about the `reportorial status' of Maydiston's highly\nrhetorical account of the festivities,46 there is no doubt that the rhetoric of\nthe chamber made a signi\u00aecant impression on contemporary observers.\n42 Two recent interpretations of the reception are G. Kipling, `Richard II's ``Sumptuous\nPageants'' and the idea of the civic triumph', in D. Bergeron (ed.), Pageantry in the\nShakespearean Theater (Athens, Ga., 1985), 83\u00b1103, and P.

Smith, `Concordia: Facta inter Regem Riccarduum II et Civitatem Londonie' (unpublished\nPrinceton University Ph.D. thesis, 1973). The other main contemporary account is an\nAnglo-Norman letter written probably by a member of the king's household and the\nsubject of H. Suggett, `A letter describing Richard's reconciliation with the city of\nLondon, 1392', English Historical Review, 62 (1947), 209\u00b113.\n43 Strohm, Hochon's Arrow, 107.\n44 Kipling, `Richard II's ``Sumptuous Pageants'' ', 88\u00b19, and G.

The quotation is from the Douai-\nRheims translation of the Latin Vulgate.\n46 Strohm, Hochon's Arrow, 107.\nThe rhetoric of the royal chamber 333\nAt the end of the procession a royal feast was held in Westminster Hall,\nduring which the steward of Richard II's household, speaking on behalf\nof the king, told the London citizens gathered in the hall that `the king\nhad been upset that, inasmuch as London was his chamber, he had been\nso badly served (``garde\u00c2s'')'.47\nLondon's self-representation as the `king's chamber' was an essential\npart of the process of reconciliation between Richard and the city and it\nhad a particular relevance to the events surrounding the king's displea-\nsure towards the capital in 1392. The word `garde\u00c2s' referred to Richard's\nperceived maltreatment by London. In part, it related directly to the\nking's awareness of unrest in the capital, the appearance of which the\ncitizens were at great pains to remedy on the king's visit in August 1392\nwhen, under the direction of the city's warden, the citizens sought to\nbeautify the city (Concordia, II. 57\u00b164). Financially, the word looked\nbackwards to the city's failure to provide the king with loans. According\nto the letter written by a member of Richard's household, on the day\nafter the steward's speech in Westminster Hall the Londoners offered to\npay \u00a3100,000 to the king for the return of the city's corporate liberties.48\nIn fact, the king excused the city this enormous sum, but he still received\na \u00aene of \u00a310,000 for the city's pardon.49 It may be that the city's failure to\nprovide both the security and the \u00aenancial services expected of the\nchamber, a distinction claimed by London in 1377 on the king's accession\nto the throne, was the ultimate cause of Richard's anger in 1392. The\nstatus of the chamber was a double-edged sword which could be\nexploited to a city's advantage, but which could also intensify the\ncrown's demands upon, and expectations of, a city.50\nRichard's con\u00aescation of London's liberties in June had been immedi-\nately preceded by the transfer from Westminster to York of the central\norgans of royal government and the king's withdrawal from the capital\nto York and the midlands.51 Although these royal agencies were only\ntold to return to Westminster in the autumn of 1392, Richard's entry into\nLondon on 21 August marked his return to the capital, and the spatial\ndimension to this use of the chamber was unmistakable: London was\nagain the king's residence, complete with decorative streets and ornate\nwalls (Concordia, II. 57, 144\u00b15), and the Londoners were celebrating the\nking's return home. Indeed, there was a literal as well as \u00aegurative sense\nin which London, with its houses adorned with gold and silk hangings\n(Concordia, II. 60\u00b12), was the king's chamber. The marital metaphor, to\nwhich both Kipling and Strohm made reference, was drawn from the\napocalyptic narrative of Christ's entry into the new Jerusalem, but it also\n47 Suggett, `Letter', 212.\n48 Ibid., 213.\n49 Barron, `Quarrel of Richard II with London', 191\u00b15.\n50 These tensions are discussed below, 346.\n51 Barron, `Quarrel of Richard II with London', 181\u00b12, and Saul, Richard II, 472.\n334 Urban History\ncapitalized upon London's claims to be the `king's chamber' and, in\npresenting the city speci\u00aecally as the bridal chamber, reinforced Lon-\ndon's desire for a uniquely personal relationship with the king.\nYork: the `king's chamber'\nAt precisely the same time, London's pretensions were challenged\nexplicitly by the city of York. In the Winchester parliament of January\n1393 Richard II was petitioned by the `fellow-citizens of your city and\nchamber of York' requesting that York's mayor and aldermen be\nappointed ex of\u00aecio justices of the peace.52 Why was the northern city\nusing language which had previously been associated only with\nLondon? First of all, it was less than a year since Richard II had, in the\nsummer of 1392, visited the city accompanied by the of\u00aeces of govern-\nment which he had transferred from Westminster to York. The signi\u00ae-\ncance of this relocation of royal government in the north has been the\nsubject of recent debate. John H. Harvey argued that there was a special\nrelationship between Richard II and the city of York and that when\nRichard moved the royal chancery, exchequer and the other royal courts\nto York in 1392 and suspended London's liberties, he considered\nseriously establishing his capital in the north on a permanent basis.53\nNigel Saul, in a careful analysis of royal diplomatic practice, has demon-\nstrated that this `alternative capital' thesis, based heavily upon the\nevidence of Richard's visits to the city, cannot be sustained since the king\ndid not visit the city any more than he did other towns and cities; in\n1392, for example, the king, far from staying in York `from early June to\nlate November, with only occasional absence', as Harvey contended,\nspent only ten days there in June.54 According to Saul, Richard's relation-\nship with the city was not especially intimate.\nWhilst it is certainly true that the transfer of royal government to York\nwas only temporary and that the king himself did not spend as much\ntime in the city as was once thought, Saul's argument underestimates the\nimpact that the presence in York of the royal courts and the royal person\nhad upon the city's inhabitants. At the end of May 1392 the of\u00aeces of\nchancery and exchequer as well as the courts of common pleas and\nking's bench were instructed to move to York by 25 June and, although\nthe order for their return to Westminster was given on 25 October, it is\n52 PRO, SC8\/103\/5147.

They were highly conscious, from their perspective at\nleast, of a special and intimate relationship between their city and the\nking.\nSecond, the city's assertion that it was the `king's chamber', in\nimitation of London, was another aspect of York's growing self-\nconsciousness which was a feature of the later fourteenth century and\nwhich was also expressed, for example, in its immodest claim to be `a\ncity of great reputation and always named the second city of the\nrealm',58 presumably behind London. Whether this self-imaging was the\nproduct of self-con\u00aedence arising from the city's economic prosperity in\nthe period, or insecurity bred by an awareness of the city's declining\npolitical importance in the kingdom, is a matter for debate.59 Although\nYork was not the only provincial city in the late Middle Ages to regard\nLondon as a role model and as an example to which to aspire,60 there is\n55 Calendar of Close Rolls, 1389\u00b192, 466\u00b17, 565; Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1391\u00b196, 65; Calendar\nof Close Rolls, 1392\u00b196, 21, 76; and Tout, Chapters, vol. 3, 482.\n56 The quotation is from N.

A good example, beyond\nthe cities discussed in this article, is Norwich, whose rulers, at the beginning of Richard\n336 Urban History\ncompelling evidence that York's rulers, in the last quarter of the four-\nteenth century, were acutely aware of the city's status in relation to\nLondon. In 1372 and again in 1377 the crown instructed certain towns\nand cities, including York, to build a vessel for service at sea at their own\nexpense.61 In 1378 the city petitioned Richard II and, reminding the king\nthat it had built three ships `at greater expense than any other city of the\nrealm with the exception of London', asked for a con\u00aermation of its\ncharters of corporate liberties, as was customary on the accession of a\nnew king, but on this occasion without the usual cash payment.62 Since\nYork had only been required to build two vessels, the city had exceeded\nexpectations and had spent more money, so it alleged, than any other\ncity apart from London. It was against London that York measured itself,\nand its appropriation of the metaphor of the chamber in 1393 was a\nrhetorical device, employed by York's civic elite to impress upon the\nking their own self-importance and prestige and their desire to extend\ntheir authority within the city.\nAlthough York's claim to be the `king's chamber' in 1393 was articu-\nlated by the city's rulers for their own particular interests, this rhetoric\nwas not the monopoly of the governing elite. Around 1400 the city's\ncommons presented three petitions to the mayor and aldermen of York\nseeking a greater in\u00afuence for the crafts in the government of the city.63\nIn their third petition the commons asked for a threefold change to the\ncity's franchise: not only was the cost of entering the freedom to be\nraised to at least 60s, but the craft searchers were to be responsible for\nexamining candidates to ensure that they were skilled in their craft,\nwhilst the mayor was to determine whether they were of `good and\nhonest behaviour'. As a result, York's franchise would be similar to `the\nhonourable cities of the realm such as London and Bristol', where men\nonly gained admission to the freedom on payment of 60s or more and on\nproof that they were `skilled and honest', in contrast to `lesser towns\nsuch as Lynn and Hull', where entry to the freedom could be secured for\n40s. Furthermore, the commons claimed that, since the city of York `is\nand always has been . . . a city of great reputation and always named the\nsecond city of the realm and the king's chamber', it was not appropriate\nfor dishonest men to be received into the freedom to enjoy the privileges\nof such an honourable city.\nII's reign, sought to secure some of the same chartered privileges as London: L.

In the late fourteenth century they were represented by\nthe searchers of the crafts on the council of forty-eight, which was the\nthird tier in York's structure of civic government, alongside the councils\nof twelve and twenty-four.64 The council of forty-eight seems only to\nhave been assembled on speci\u00aec occasions to give its assent to decisions\nalready made by the inner councils, such as the levying of a civic tax in\n1378 to repair York's barge which had been built for war at the city's\nexpense and which was now in a dilapidated state.65 Whilst the\ncommons' legislative role could be seen as a public relations exercise\ndesigned to secure widespread support for the ordinances of the ruling\nelite, the commons also had the right to petition the mayor and aldermen\nto express their grievances.66\nThe petition concerning the tightening of the rules for admission to the\nfreedom was a reaction by the commons to the growing power of the\nruling elite in the last quarter of the fourteenth century, who were selling\nthe privilege freely without discretion in order to expand the city's\ncorporate resources.67 York's civic elite were confronted by an articulate\nand assertive commons who were anxious that only properly quali\u00aeed\ncraftsmen should be admitted to the franchise and who wanted the craft\nsearchers to have a greater power of selection over entry to the freedom.\nRather than draw attention to the damage in\u00aficted upon the crafts which\nthey represented, the commons \u00aerst drew explicit comparison with\nLondon and Bristol and then invoked York's claims to be the `king's\nchamber' and `second city of the realm'. Tapping into the acute sense of\nrivalry and competition for status so evident in the city's 1378 and 1393\npetitions, their petition suggested implicitly that the reputation of the\ncity would be harmed and its prestige undermined if access to the\nfreedom was not regulated by the crafts.\nIf the rhetoric of the 1378 and 1393 petitions enhanced the honour and\ndignity of York's civic elite, the commons appropriated the same\nlanguage to appeal to the pretensions of the city's rulers. In this way, the\nchamber, as a symbol of corporate civic identity and a source of civic\n64 York Memorandum Book, ed. M. Sellers, 2 vols, Surtees Society, 120, 125 (1912, 1915), vol. 1,\niv-ix.

The evidence from York in the late fourteenth century\nsupports Rosser's argument that, whilst civic symbols and images could\nbe invoked `to lend prestige to a particular regime' within a town, they\n`set up resonances which echoed far beyond any single or narrow\npolitical position' and provided an opportunity for `parties in dispute' to\narticulate and debate particular issues with the dominant civic elite.68\nAlthough the commons' petition was rejected, despite the sophistication\nof their argument,69 the chamber was a powerful civic symbol which\ncould be valuable in the negotiation of political relations within and\nwithout the urban community.\nCoventry: the `prince's chamber'\nThe adaptability of the chamber to changing political circumstances is no\nbetter illustrated than in the case of Coventry in the Wars of the Roses. It\nhas long been recognized that the civil wars of the mid-\u00aefteenth century\ncreated new dif\u00aeculties for towns in their relations with the crown,\nmaking them unsure of the reception they should give to rival royal and\nnoble protagonists.70 In September 1456 Margaret of Anjou was wel-\ncomed into the city of Coventry by a collection of biblical, saintly and\nmythical \u00aegures, including the Nine Worthies, the \u00aerst of whom, Hector\nof Troy, greeted the queen at a pageant station between the cross and the\nconduit in Cross Cheaping, the commercial centre of the city, and\naddressed her in the following words:\nMost pleasaunt princes recordid \u0087at may be,\nI, Hector of Troy, \u0087at am chefe conqueroure,\nLowly wyll obey yowe & knele on my kne,\nAnd welcum yowe tendurly to your honoure\nTo this conabull cite, the princes chambur;\nWhome ye bare yn youre bosom, joy to \u0087is lande,\nThro whome in prosperite \u0087is empyre shall stand.71\nIn 1474 the infant Prince Edward, son and heir of Edward IV, visited the\ncity and was received into `this your chaumbre, so called of Antiquite',72\nbut the reputedly ancient origin of Coventry's status as the `prince's\nchamber' is doubtful.\n68 Rosser, `Myth', 8, 15.\n69 The petition has been crossed through in the civic record.\n70 Barron, `London and the crown', 88\u00b1109; D.J.

On the death in 1358 of Isabella, Edward\nII's queen, the manor of Cheylesmore, including Coventry, reverted to\nthe Black Prince in accordance with an agreement made in 1337 on his\nelevation to the dukedom of Cornwall: henceforth the citizens of\nCoventry were his tenants and the city's fee farm contributed to his\nlanded income.74 From this date the city continued to be part of the\npatrimony of the king's eldest son, the Prince of Wales. Coventry was,\nfor example, one of the properties granted to Richard of Bordeaux in\n1376, Henry of Monmouth in 1399 and Edward of Lancaster, only son\nand heir of Henry VI, in 1455.75 In fact, whilst Coventry could claim a\nconnection with the Black Prince, there are much more compelling\nreasons why the city \u00aerst chose to describe itself as the `prince's\nchamber' in 1456.\nThe appropriation by Coventry of the metaphor of the chamber in\nSeptember 1456 was prompted, as in the case of York in 1393, by the\ntransfer of the king's government to the city. In the summer months of\n1456 the king withdrew from London and the south, moved to the\nmidlands, and in September established his court at Coventry where it\nstayed, with only the occasional break, until July 1460. Though the main\nof\u00aeces of state remained at Westminster, Coventry at this time was very\nmuch the Lancastrian capital where the king maintained his court and\nheld a series of great councils as well as a parliament.76 As in 1393, one\nof the main reasons for the king's movement north lay in the perception\nof widespread disorder in London, on this occasion the result of anti-\nalien riots.77 That the king should consequently feel safe in the midlands,\nand in Coventry in particular, can be explained both by the city's close\nproximity to the queen's dower estates of Leicester, Tutbury and Kenil-\nworth, and by Coventry's close political relationship with the Lancas-\ntrian regime. Not only had Henry VI, after commending Coventry's\nrulers for having `the best ruled pepull thenne withe-in my Reame',\ngranted the city a charter in 1451 separating it from the county of\nWarwickshire and elevating it to the status of a county in its own right,\nbut the city had repaid this privilege and provided tangible evidence of\nthe king's `speciall trust' in it by sending a retinue of 100 soldiers to \u00aeght\n73 Lancaster, `Coventry', 1, and C.

First of all, in a \u00aenancial sense, the city, ever\nsince its association with the Black Prince, was one of the principal\nproperties of the Prince of Wales, to whom the citizens paid revenue in\nthe form of an annual fee farm. Second, and more importantly, Coven-\ntry's rulers were acutely aware of the Lancastrian concern with royal\nlineage at this time and of the importance which the king attached to the\nbirth of an heir to buttress the Lancastrian dynasty.79 In August 1456 the\ncity's rulers made preparations to receive Queen Margaret and Prince\nEdward, but the young prince did not make his planned entrance into\nthe city.80 Nevertheless, while the king himself was a peripheral \u00aegure in\nthe royal reception, barely mentioned in the civic record, the queen was\nwelcomed into Coventry with visual imagery and language which\nfocused on her relationship with the absent prince.81 Whether it was the\nspeeches of the prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah, who congratulated the\nqueen on the birth of the prince, or the words of St Edward the Confessor\nwho informed the queen that he would pray `for prince Edwarde, my\ngostly chylde, whom I love principall', or the ordering of the pageants\nwhich ensured the appearance of the prince's patron saint before the\nbelated arrival of St Margaret in the last pageant of the entry, the\npageants performed for the queen referred speci\u00aecally to the prince.82\nThe theme of the pageants was the prince's birth nearly three years\nearlier, which Isaiah likened to Christ's nativity and which St John the\nEvangelist believed `shall cause grete melody' in the kingdom.83 In\ndramatizing this event Coventry's rulers were doing more than expres-\nsing their joy at the advent of their new feudal overlord; if, as Ralph\nGrif\u00aeths has suggested, Richard Duke of York, Henry VI's adversary,\nalso entertained serious dynastic ambitions at this time,84 Coventry's\ndecision in 1456 to focus its attention on the prince can be seen as a\ndeclaration of the city's loyalty to the Lancastrian line. Indeed, it is\ninteresting to note the way in which Coventry's self-designation as the\n`prince's chamber' in September 1456 anticipated, and later chimed in\nwith, Margaret of Anjou's development and use of the prince's council\nas an agent for royal government and as a means to legitimate her\n78 For the background to the 1451 charter, see Coventry Leet Book, vol. 2, 262\u00b16.

At Bablake gate, one of the main entrances into the walled\ncity, the young prince was addressed \u00aerst by the \u00aegure of `Rex Ricardus',\npresumably Richard II:\nWelcom, full high and nobull prince, to us right speciall,\nTo this your chaumbre, so called of Antiquite!\nThe presens of your noble person reioyseth our hartes all;\nWe all mowe blesse the tyme of your Natiuite.\nThe right lyne of the Royall blode ys now as itt schulde be;\nWherefore God of his goodnes preserue you in bodily helth,\nTo us and your tenauntes here perpetuall ioy; and to all the londis welth!86\nKing Richard was followed immediately by the three patriarchs, one of\nwhom welcomed Edward into `this his Chaumber, as prynce full\nreuerent', whilst St Edward the Confessor, at the next pageant station,\nrepeated the greeting, receiving the prince `Vnto this your Chaumber, as\nprynce full excellent'.87 Compared with 1456, this was a more emphatic\nstatement of Coventry's status as the `prince's chamber', the main reason\nfor which was the prince's actual presence in the city in 1474.\nThe chamber in 1474 had several meanings. First, there was a spatial\ndimension in the sense that Coventry was part of the prince's patrimony\nand the chamber a physical reality which was his to enter.88 Second, the\ncitizens were, as King Richard reminded the prince, his `tenants', whose\nfeudal dues were paid to the prince, a \u00aenancial relationship acted out in\na gift-giving ceremony when, in the words of the city's Leet Book, the\nmayor and his brethren rode out to meet the prince to accompany him\ninto the city, `welcomyng hym to his Chaumber and yevyng hym there a\nC mark in a gilt Coppe of xv Ouncez'.89 But the rhetoric of the chamber\nwas also politicized. Coventry had been an important Lancastrian base\n85 I would like to thank Caroline Barron for this point.

Edward then moved to\nthe town of Warwick to give the earl a further opportunity to vacate\nCoventry, but the earl did not take it and, in the meantime, Edward and\nhis brother, George Duke of Clarence, Warwick's erstwhile ally, were\nreconciled. After a week of negotiations in which Warwick refused\nrepeatedly to confront Edward, the Yorkist king \u00aenally left the midlands\nfor London. Coventry, as a walled city, had offered protection to the earl,\nbut how much active support the city gave Warwick at this point is\nuncertain. Coventry's geographical location in the midlands and its\nproximity to the centre of the road network meant that the city had a\nstrategic signi\u00aecance in the Wars of the Roses.93 Yet Warwick would not\nhave gone to the city in the \u00aerst place to wait for reinforcements if he had\nnot known that he would be welcomed there, and there are signs that he\nhad a support base in the city which he had been cultivating for a\nnumber of years.94 As well as loyalty to Warwick, the city may also have\n90 Ibid., 317.\n91 The best narrative account of these events remains C.

In this situation, Coventry's\nrepeated allusion to its ancient status as the `prince's chamber' formed\nthe city's developing strategy to combat the dif\u00aeculties created by the\nearlier dynastic uncertainties. In the same way that London's customary\nresponse to the Wars of the Roses was to `wait for the winner and then to\nhelp legitimise his control by treating him like all previous winners', in\nLondon's case with pageantry and money,98 so Coventry's rulers\ndecided that, just as they had referred to the city as the `prince's\nchamber' to emphasize their loyalty to the Lancastrian dynasty, the same\nlanguage could also express their \u00aedelity to the Yorkists. In fact, when\nthe Tudors supplanted the Yorkists and Arthur, son and heir of Henry\nVII, came to Coventry in 1498, the young prince received similar\ntreatment to his Lancastrian and Yorkist predecessors and was greeted\nby three \u00aegures each welcoming him into `\u0087is youre Chaumbre'.99\nIn 1474 the rhetoric of the chamber was also designed to settle the\nYorkists' unease about their legitimacy. As a usurping dynasty, the\nYorkists were very conscious of the need to establish their legitimate\npossession of the crown based on hereditary right, which they did\nthrough the creation and dissemination of manuscript genealogies and\nprophecies.100 In the welcome for the prince in 1474, Coventry's rulers\ntapped into the Yorkists' genealogical interest to present Edward as the\nlawful heir to the throne both through heredity and prophecy.101 First,\nthere was the presence of Richard II, to whom the Yorkists believed they\nwere the legitimate successors, who told the prince that with his birth\n`his servondis & wolwyllers with-in the cyte of Covyntre' on 12 Jun. 1469 informing\nthem of the forthcoming marriage of Clarence and Warwick's daughter, see Coventry\nLeet Book, vol. 2, 332, 341\u00b12.\n95 Ibid., 364\u00b16.\n96 Barron, `London and the crown', 96\u00b17.\n97 Coventry Leet Book, vol. 2, 367\u00b171, 381.\n98 Guth, `Richard III, Henry VII and the city', 186.\n99 Coventry Leet Book, vol. 3, 589\u00b192.\n100 A.

Second, one\nof the three patriarchs proclaimed that the prince `of most nobull blode'\nwas their heir in ful\u00aelment of biblical prophecy. Ignoring the recent past\nand their previous support for the Lancastrians, the city's rulers drew\nattention instead to the antiquity of the city's status as the `prince's\nchamber', by virtue of which they had a special relationship with the\nprince (`prince, to us right speciall'), whose birth as the rightful heir to\nthe throne had brought particular joy to the citizens as the prince's\ntenants. Given the theme of the 1474 royal entry, it is perhaps hardly\nsurprising that at the end of the visit the mayor and city council were\nordered to swear an oath of loyalty to the prince, acknowledging him as\n`verray and vndoubted heire' to the throne, whom they would be ready\nto serve at all times and for whom they would even die if the situation\ndemanded it.102\nConclusion\nIn late medieval England the chamber denoted an attitude to relations\nbetween urban communities and the crown based essentially upon the\nvalues of intimacy and physical proximity, order and \u00aenancial service.\nThe metaphor was used speci\u00aecally by London, York and Coventry as\npart of the process by which they re-negotiated their relations with the\ncrown at certain critical moments. The chamber never became a formal\ntitle,103 and the cities only distinguished themselves as royal chambers at\nspeci\u00aec times, often preceding, during or following periods of royal\npresence in the city, when they wanted something from the crown, either\nto acquire (as in the case of York in 1393), to regain (as in the case of\nLondon in 1392) or to preserve (as in the case of Coventry in 1474) their\nchartered liberties.\nThere were other channels of communication and other terminology,\nsuch as the language of patronage, which cities could employ to gain the\nattention of royal authority.104 One important context in which crown-\ntown relations were conducted was parliament. Although parliament\nmay have been less important to London's civic elite since the city's\nproximity to the royal government gave Londoners regular access to the\nking, this was not true for provincial cities.105 Parliament was a political\n102 Ibid., 393\u00b14.\n103 Interestingly, the idea of London as the `king's chamber' did not appear, for example, in\nJohn Carpenter's history of London's constitutional status and customs at the beginning\nof the Liber Albus, which was compiled in the early \u00aefteenth century: Munimenta\nGildhallae Londoniensis: Liber Albus, Liber Custumarum, et Liber Horn, ed. H.T. Riley, 3 vols\nin 4 (Rolls Series, 1859\u00b162), vol. 1, 3\u00b1127.\n104 For the concept of `good lordship' in relation to urban communities, see Attreed,\n`Politics of welcome', 208\u00b131.\n105 Bryant, `Paris and London', 25, and C. Barron, `London and parliament in the\nLancastrian period', Parliamentary History, 9 (1990), 343. The importance of parliament to\nBristol and York is discussed in C.D. Liddy, `Urban communities and the crown:\nThe rhetoric of the royal chamber 345\narena which had its own language and was concerned primarily with\n`national security, social and political division, good governance' and\ntaxation.106 Furthermore, the status of a royal chamber could be a\nburden. Whilst it denoted a special relationship which could be exploited\nby a city to forward its own interests, this same relationship could also\nwork against a city, leading the crown to expect more than it was able to\nprovide and to interfere in its affairs,107 or being invoked by the urban\ncommons in disputes with the civic elite. The experiences of London,\nYork and Coventry may well have led the rulers of other towns and\ncities to think again about the value of such self-promotion and may\nexplain why only these cities proclaimed themselves royal chambers in\nthe fourteenth and \u00aefteenth centuries.\nNevertheless, the special relationship which London, York and Cov-\nentry claimed with the crown, predicated on their access to royal\nauthority, their \u00aenancial service and loyalty to the crown in return for the\npreservation or extension of chartered privileges, and the image of\nstability and unity which they presented to the royal government, has a\nwider relevance to the study of crown-town relations. Not only does the\nchamber provide further evidence of the reciprocal nature of these\nrelations but, as a symbol of corporate civic identity, it also serves as a\nreminder of the position of royal towns and cities within the late\nmedieval English polity and of the importance which they attached to\ntheir relationship with the crown. The charters of liberties which these\ncities received did not grant autonomy, but incorporated them more fully\ninto the apparatus of royal government, increasing the royal obligations\nof their rulers.108 Moreover, the way in which London, York and\nCoventry tried to de\u00aene themselves as royal chambers and competed\nwith other cities for status suggests that the predilection among urban\nhistorians for compiling league tables measuring the performance of late\nmedieval English towns and cities would have struck a chord with the\ncities themselves in the fourteenth and \u00aefteenth centuries.109 Inasmuch\nas cities were ambitious for access to the crown and sought its favour\nand privilege in return for service, competing for position with each\nrelations between Bristol, York and the royal government, 1350\u00b11400' (unpublished\nUniversity of York D.Phil. thesis, 1999), ch. 5.\n106 Harriss, `Dimensions of politics', 15.\n107 L.

The chamber\nformed part of the rewriting of the civic past and the reshaping of a\nshared corporate identity which, as Robert Tittler's recent work on the\npolitical culture of post-Reformation towns has shown, took place in a\nnumber of urban communities in the sixteenth and seventeenth centu-\nries.110 According to Tittler, civic elites, seeking to bolster their own\nauthority and to secure the loyalty of their citizens in a period of\ndramatic social, economic and religious change, aimed to refashion `a\ncommon local history or memory' and to encourage `their fellows to\nundertake a more informed appreciation of their own community, of its\nheritage, of its distinctiveness, and of the necessary authority of its\ngoverning elite'.111\nThus, in Coventry in 1581, on the occasion of the Earl of Leicester's\nvisit to the city, a series of Latin and English verses were composed\nabout several \u00aegures of local as well as national signi\u00aecance, including\nthe legendary Leofric and Godiva, and displayed in the guildhall.112 Two\nwere in honour of the Black Prince and were accompanied by depictions\nof the city's arms and the prince's heraldic device.113 On the one hand,\nthe verses commemorated the prince as a paragon of chivalric values\n(`the \u00afoure of chevalre'), whose heroic actions had won famous victories\nagainst the French; on the other hand, they represented him as a local\nhero who had established his residence in Coventry (`Hic sedem posuit')\nand who had championed the city's rights and extended its corporate\nliberties. This particular association with the Black Prince can only be\nseen, however, as a case of selective civic memory: it was not the Black\nPrince but Queen Isabella, the mother of Edward III, who, as overlord of\nCoventry from 1330 to 1358, had actively supported the city in its long-\nrunning con\u00afict with the prior and had promoted its interests at court,\nhelping to restrict the prior's power in the city and to unite Coventry\nunder the newly-formed jurisdiction of the mayor and bailiffs.114 The\n110 R.

Coss, `Coventry before incorporation: a re-interpretation',\nThe rhetoric of the royal chamber 347\nBlack Prince was a \u00aegure of particular interest in the later sixteenth\ncentury,115 and the 1581 verses celebrating his relations with the city,\ninscribed as they were on oak panelling \u00aexed to the east and west walls\nof the great hall in St Mary's Hall, the seat of Coventry's civic govern-\nment, aimed to reinforce the authority and legitimacy of the city's ruling\nelite at a time of rising social tension caused largely by serious economic\ndecline.116\nIn 1604 London's rulers elaborated upon the capital's traditional\nclaims to be the `king's chamber' as part of a similar mythologizing of\nthe city's past. Entering the city of London in March 1604 before his\ncoronation, James I was welcomed \u00aerst through Fenchurch Arch, deco-\nrated with the words, `Londinium: Camera Regia'.117 This title provided\nan organizing scheme for the whole event, as the king progressed\nthrough various arches, each of which represented a different part of the\nroyal court, including a series of royal chambers such as the presence\nchamber and the privy chamber.118 The idea of London as the `king's\nchamber', which London's rulers had drawn upon in the city's medieval\npast, was the basis of the city's defence of its special position within the\nkingdom. Speci\u00aecally, the conceit was a defensive gesture made in\nresponse to anti-London writings which blamed the capital's commercial\ndominance for the economic contraction experienced by many of\nEngland's provincial cities in the sixteenth century.119 The authority and\nlegitimacy of tradition was invoked to validate the changing distribution\nof power in the present.\nNowhere was this more true than in the case of Bristol. In 1628 Bristol\npetitioned Henrietta, Charles I's queen, asking for her intercession with\nthe king in order to annex Bristol castle and its precincts to the city under\nthe mayor's authority.120 The castle had been a jurisdictional mine\u00aeeld\nMidland History, 2 (1974), 137\u00b151, and A. and E. Gooder, `Coventry before 1355: unity or\ndivision?', Midland History, 6 (1981), 1\u00b138. Although they disagree about the extent of\nthe division before the early fourteenth century, they agree that it was Isabella's\nintervention in the city's dispute with the prior which was crucial to the emergence of\ncivic government in Coventry.\n115 For this interest in `the history of great men of action' in Elizabethan England, see\nM.

The quotation is from 113\u00b114.\n348 Urban History\nfor Bristol's rulers for a long time; since it lay outside civic jurisdiction\nthe castle precincts offered a safe haven for criminals. In the petition the\ncity appealed to the queen, reminding her that:\nthe Cittie of Bristoll hath aunciently bene reputed and called the Chamber of the\nQueenes of England, as London is called the Kinges Chamber, and it hath\npleased the Queenes of England, your most noble predecessors . . . soe to esteeme\nthereof as to receive and take the same unto her especiall favour and protection\nwhiles she lived. And bycause the same Citty is parcell of your Majesties\njoincture wee most humbly pray your Majestie to receive it into your Highnes\nfavour.\nBristol's connection with the queen was close and long-standing, for the\ncity had \u00aerst been annexed to the queen's dower in 1274 when Edward I\nprovided his wife, Eleanor of Castile, with a landed income of her\nown,121 but how long the city had been known as the `queen's chamber'\nis debatable. Certainly, the antiquity of Bristol's title is questionable,\nsince the city's records reveal only the occasional reference to the\n`Chambre of Bristowe' and `her Majestes Chamber', and these date from\n1535 and 1612 respectively.122 The evidence from Bristol shows, however,\nthat the chamber was, as it had always been, an occasional rhetorical\ndevice, which continued into the seventeenth century to play a part in\nthe symbolic language of politics through which relations between urban\ncommunities and the crown could be mediated. Moreover, as in the cases\nof York and Coventry in the fourteenth and \u00aefteenth centuries, Bristol's\nrulers looked self-consciously to the example of London for inspiration.\nIn such continuities lie the importance of the metaphor of the chamber.\n121 Calendar of Charter Rolls, 1257\u00b11300, 193.\n122 Ricart, Maire of Bristowe is Kalendar, 54, 65.\nThe rhetoric of the royal chamber 349\n"}
