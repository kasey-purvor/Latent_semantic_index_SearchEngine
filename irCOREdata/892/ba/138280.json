As a\nconsequence, a stream of research on the relationship between marketing and R&D (e.g.\nGupta et al. 1986), marketing and finance (e.g. Rajendra et al. 1998), marketing and\nengineering (Fisher et al. 1997) and the integration of marketing with several other functions\nin the formation of business strategy can be traced (e.g. Hutt et al. 1988; Kahn and Mentzer\n1998). The overarching rationale of this research is that customer value is being created\nthrough the integration of areas that are not traditionally associated with marketing.\nThe relationship between different disciplines sharing the same customer focus and market\ncommitment has always had an underlying internal competition for primacy, i.e. it is also\nconcerned with how each of the functions add value to the company. Over the last decade,\ncritical voices have stressed that marketing has generally not been very good at managing\nout-of-the-box and across boundaries (Piercy 2002), has been complacent in its view that\nmarketing \u201cowns the customer\u201d (Brady and Davis 1993), has failed to provide the coherence\nto corporate organisation, operations and processes that its proponents claim (Rainbird\n2004), and, consequently, was outpaced by new models aimed at building value which\noriginated mainly in manufacturing, operations or IT, but not in marketing (Doyle 1995).\nOne of these models, which has rapidly become a strategic priority in many companies, is\nsupply chain management (SCM). SCM has grown in importance since the early 1990s,\nalthough the approach was introduced in early 1980 (Oliver and Webber 1982). SCM can be\ndefined as \u201cthe management of upstream and downstream relationships with suppliers and\ncustomers in order to create enhanced value in the final market place at less cost to the\nsupply chain as a whole\u201d (Christopher 1998). The synergies between SCM and marketing\nhave been widely acknowledged (e.g. Martin and Grbac 2003; Ellinger 2000; Svensson\n2002), leading some to conclude that better coordination could define competitive superiority\nin new ways (Piercy 2002, p. 247).\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n5 of 41\nThe most recently introduced approach of demand chain management (DCM) seems to\ncapture the proposed synergies between SCM and marketing by starting with the specific\ncustomer needs and designing the chain to satisfy these needs, instead of starting with the\nsupplier\/manufacturer and working forwards (Heikkil\u00e4 2002). Such an integration seems\nmandatory in today\u2019s marketplace, where customers benefit from having real-time access to\ntheir accounts, making real-time changes in their customised product configuration and\ncommunicating their individual service requirements. While most DCM contributions to date\nstem from SCM and operations (e.g. Vollmann 1995; Childerhouse et al. 2002, Lee 2001,\nLee and Whang 2001; Rainbird 2004), selected citations among marketing academics can\nalso be traced (Baker 2003). This paper proposes DCM as a model which can stimulate new\nresearch in marketing, and thereby leverage its contribution to value creation for the\ncustomer as well as for the company.\nSo far, most contributions to DCM have been based on best practice examples (e.g. Lee and\nWhang 200;, SAP 2003; Deloitte 2002; Langabeer and Rose 2002) and lack a conceptual\nfoundation. In order to develop a DCM framework and derive the roles of marketing within\nDCM, we conducted a co-development workshop as well as focus group discussions to\ngenerate additional practitioner input.\nThe objectives of our paper are firstly, to show the advantages of an integration between\nmarketing and SCM; secondly, to demonstrate how DCM can leverage the strengths of\nmarketing and SCM and meet the challenges of customer value creation in today\u2019s\nmarketplace and thirdly; to suggest a conceptual framework for DCM with propositions for\nfurther research addressing the role of marketing in DCM. We draw on a literature review\nand compare, contrast and supplement it with our findings from a discovery-orientated co-\ndevelopment workshop and validating focus group discussions. The article is organised into\nthree parts: in the first part, the benefits of the integration between marketing and supply\nchain management are discussed. Next, the few existing works on demand chain\nmanagement are presented and the concept is defined. In the third and main part, a\nconceptual model for demand chain management that integrates the emerging themes from\nour exploratory field work with the existing literature is developed and the roles of marketing\nwithin DCM are derived.\nMARKETING AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n6 of 41\nThe old \u201cmantra\u201d of marketing success, i.e. having the right product in the right place at the\nright time, suggests why SCM has increasingly gained influence in areas which were\noriginally the domain of marketing and marketing channel management. At the same time,\nhowever, it also demonstrates the synergies between both disciplines.\nIn SCM, much of the recent debate has centred on the ability of the supply chain to be either\n\u201clean\u201d (Womack and Jones 1996) or \u201cagile\u201d (Goldman, Nagel et al. 1995). Lean supply\nchains on the one hand focus on doing \u201cmore with less\u201d by reducing waste or \u201cmuda\u201d\nthrough inventory reduction, lean manufacturing, and a just-in-time approach. A lean\napproach is said to be suitable for markets characterised by predictable demand, high\nvolume and low requirements for product variety. Agile supply chains, on the other hand, are\ndesigned for flexibility, emphasising the supply chain\u2019s ability to respond rapidly to changes\nin demand, both in terms of volume and variety. The market conditions in which companies\nwith agile supply chains find themselves are characterised by volatile demand and high\nrequirements for variety (Christopher 2000). The trend towards commoditisation in many\nindustries today has pushed lean as well as agile SCM to the fore. In markets where\ncustomers perceive little difference between products and in which brand loyalty dwindles,\ntimely availability becomes a major determinant of success. Still, the tempting promises of\nSCM, which aims at \u201clowering the total amount of resources required to provide the\nnecessary level of customer service\u201d (Jones and Riley 1985), should not disguise its\nlimitations: SCM focuses on the efficient matching of supply with demand but does not\nprovide answers to the customer conundrum, i.e. it does not help the company to find out\nwhat the customer perceives as valuable, and how this customer-perceived value can be\ntranslated into customer value propositions. In other words, supply chain efficiency by itself\nwill not increase customer value and satisfaction (Rainbird 2004).\nEver since the academic debate began on the theoretical foundation of marketing, the\n\u201ccreation of value through exchange processes\u201d (Sheth, Gardner and Garrett 1988, p. 201)\nhas been widely accepted as the \u201craison d\u2019\u00eatre\u201d of marketing. Today, the value orientation is\nmore prevalent than ever before (Piercy 1998, Flint 2004). Customer value can be defined\nas \u201ca customer\u2019 perceived preference for and evaluation of those product attributes, attribute\nperformances, and consequences arising from use that facilitate achieving the customer\u2019s\ngoals and purposes in use situations\u201d (Woodruff 1997, p. 142). This definition incorporates a\nhierarchy with attributes, consequences and goals and thereby emphasises the active role of\nthe customer in the value creating process. Moreover, Parasuraman (1997) stresses the\ndynamic nature of customer value, which doesn\u2019t only vary across customers but also within\ncustomers over time. As a consequence, companies need to understand not only what each\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n7 of 41\ncustomer values but also the drivers behind changing perceptions of value over time (Flint et\nal. 1997). Marketing\u2019s strength lies in understanding the forces which affect the way in which\ncustomers perceive value (obtaining market and customer knowledge), finding out the\ndiffering needs of customer groups (market\/customer segmentation), translating them into\nproduct and service packages to meet those differing needs (customised product\/service\ndevelopment) and marketing the packages through customer value propositions (pricing,\nbranding, communication, promotion). A key component of present conceptualisations of the\nstrategic role of marketing is customer relationship management (CRM). CRM has been\ndefined as a macrolevel process \u201cthat involves the development and leveraging of market\nintelligence for the purpose of building and maintaining a profit-maximising portfolio of\ncustomer relationships\u201d (Zablah et al. 2004).\nTo summarise, whereas supply chain management focuses on efficient supply, and tends to\nbe cost-orientated, marketing is more concerned with revenue by focusing on the demand\nside of the company. Evidently, together, they determine the company\u2019s profitability. Within\nthe marketing as well as the supply chain literature, the need to link both sides has been\nemphasised. From a marketing perspective, Flint (2004) argues that effective marketing\nstrategy implementation demands SCM, because it includes the distribution component of a\nmarketing strategy. Similarly, Sheth et al. (2000) emphasise in their customer-centric\nmarketing approach the need for marketing to become responsible for supply management1.\nThey argue that in markets with increasing diversity in customer needs and wants,\n\u201ccompanies will have to rapidly adjust their supply to meet demand, that is, practice demand-\ndriven supply management\u201d (p. 61). Moreover, Kumar et al. (2000) suggest that market\ndriven firms will gain a more sustainable competitive advantage by not only offering superior\ncustomer value propositions, but by having a unique business system to support it. The\nbusiness system as the configuration of activities required to create, produce and deliver the\ncustomer value proposition refers to SCM. Shrivastava et al. (1999) define CRM, SCM and\nnew product development as the three core business processes which explicitly contribute to\ngenerating and sustaining customer value. They argue that the role of marketing is to\nconnect these processes, yet admit that while it will have a leading function in managing\ncustomer relationships, its role in SCM is restricted to \u201carticulation and navigation\u201d (p. 172).\nInterestingly, the stream of research in marketing which recognised the move towards\nnetworks and network competition at the beginning of the nineties redefined and extended\n1 The terms supply management and supply chain management are used inconsistently by different authors.\nHowever, supply management appears to be used more often in the context of the intra-company integration of\nsupply functions whereas supply chain management includes intra- and inter-company integration (e.g. Bechtel\nand Jayaram 1997, Lambert and Cooper 2000, Cooper et al. 2001, Mentzer et al. 2001).\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n8 of 41\nthe role of marketing, but did not acknowledge the need for a closer integration of marketing\nand SCM (Achrol 1991 and 199; Achrol and Kotler 1999).\nWithin the SCM literature, most of the contributions which aim to define SCM refer to the\nimportance of integrating marketing into the SCM concept. For example, Cooper et al.\n(1997) and Lambert and Cooper (2000) define SCM as the integration and management of\nkey business processes across the supply chain. They outline three marketing-related\nbusiness processes: (1) CRM, (2) customer service management and (3) demand\nmanagement. The demand management process, in particular, must balance the customer\u2019s\nrequirements with the firm\u2019s capabilities and use key customer data to reduce uncertainty\nand provide efficient flow throughout the supply chain. Mentzer et al. (2001) also build their\nmodel of SCM on the interfunctional coordination of key business processes spanning\nsupply and marketing- related functions. They conclude that the question of how these\nfunctions can be effectively coordinated needs to be researched. Similarly, Bechtel and\nJayaram (1997) suggest a research agenda for SCM and emphasise the need for the supply\nchain to begin with the customer. They propose that \u201ca better term would be seamless\ndemand pipeline, where the end user and not the supply function drives the supply chain\u201d (p.\n18-19). Fisher (1997) links the integration of marketing into SCM to the concept of the supply\nchain\u2019s \u201cmarket mediation role\u201d. Within this role the supply chain needs to ensure that the\n\u201cvariety of products reaching the marketplace matches what consumers want to buy\u201d (p.\n107). Min and Mentzer (2000) emphasise the important role that marketing orientation and\nrelationship marketing play in the implementation of SCM. Finally, the Efficient Consumer\nResponse (ECR) approach is another area which emerged within the logistics community\nand clearly addresses the interface between marketing and SCM (e.g. Alvarado and Kotzab\n2001).\nOverall, it appears as if the supply chain community has considered the integration of\nmarketing more openly than the other way round. Min and Mentzer (2000) even argue that\n\u201cthe marketing concept, market orientation, relationship marketing and SCM are not\nseparate but inextricably intertwined\u201d (p. 782). Other authors state that the SCM concept\naims to reintegrate marketing and logistics, which initially were closely linked but drifted\napart over time (Svensson 2002)2. Our literature review suggests that the number of\ncontributions addressing the interface between SCM and marketing within the SCM field\noutnumber those from the marketing field (e.g. Emerson and Grimm 1996; Murphy and Poist\n1996; Morash et al. 1996; Ellinger 2000; Christopher and Peck 2003). Even for the most\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n9 of 41\nobvious interface between logistics and marketing channel management, Alvarado and\nKotzab (2001) state that \u201cmarketing academics have been slow to rise to the occasion of\ncombining logistics research into their studies of channel systems\u201d (p. 184).\nDespite these strong arguments for an integrated approach, in many businesses, the supply\nside still seems to be disconnected from the demand side and supply chain managers have\nonly a faint idea of the drivers behind customer demand. In a benchmarking study of more\nthan 400 companies, Mentzer (2004) found that demand management, as well as the\nconcept of demand itself, are not well understood by the supply chain community. He\nconcludes that many companies have failed to realise that supply chain coordination is not\npossible without an adequate understanding of demand. In another global survey among\n249 executives across 28 countries, Deloitte (2002) find that only a minority (17%) of all\ncompanies have effectively linked their supply chain and customer operations. Not\nsurprisingly, these integrated companies have outperformed their competitors on a range of\nperformance criteria (sales growth, market share, customer service and return on assets).\nThe different levels of marketing and supply chain integration can be depicted with the help\nof the following matrix:\nInsert Figure 1 here\nWhereas market losers have neither marketing nor supply chain strengths, supply chain\nspecialists have a distinct capability in managing the supply-related processes. This enables\nthem to reduce time and costs in manufacturing, procurement and distribution and to\naccelerate the change in asset turnover. Companies with a supply chain advantage usually\nplace a strong emphasis on activities such as strategic sourcing, collaborative planning,\nforecasting and replenishment (CPFR) and inventory reduction (e.g. just-in-time). Rainbird\n(2004) reports that an Australian supermarket chain has achieved major cost savings\nthrough its supply chain excellence, which could then be reinvested in lower selling prices.\nStill, as Piercy (2002) argues, a supply chain strength that is not linked to marketing\ndifferentiation usually limits the company to competing on price and availability; a strategy\nfollowed, for example, by cheap generics providers. Competing through supply chain\nexcellence hence assumes that price is a major determinant of competitive advantage.\nMoreover, Lee (2001) emphasises the problems of SCM acting independently of marketing\nmanagement. Differentiated demand for products and services is a key input to SCM. If both\n2 We acknowledge that SCM is more than the integration of logistics processes across organisations (e.g.\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n10 of 41\nsides are separated, supply will view demand as exogenous and will fail to recognise that\ndemand was influenced by the company\u2019s customer facing functions. Also, if consistent and\ntimely customer and demand information does not flow, the company will not be able to\nrespond to differentiated needs of individual customers and customer segments. Among the\nconsequences are suboptimal product and service development, a lack of product and\nservice differentiation and ineffective product and service delivery.\nMarketing specialists have a strength in identifying unique customer needs, managing\ncustomer relationships and\/or in developing strong brands. In particular, the recent trend\ntowards Customer Relationship Management (CRM) has enabled many companies to\ncapture customer contact and purchasing data, to segment their customer base, to\npersonalise the value propositions and to integrate marketing channels (e.g. Day and Van\nden Bulte 2002; Zablah et al. 2004). Using their extensive customer knowledge also enables\nthem to apply marketing instruments in a more cost-effective way. However, superior\nmarketing strength combined with a lack of supply chain strength leads to a high cost base\nand slow delivery; problems which can only be compensated by an extremely strong brand\n(Piercy 2002). A company which is unable to deliver the promises made in the individual\ncustomer relationships due to a lack of support capabilities will lose credibility and customer\nsatisfaction will decrease. Typical problems are under delivering and over delivering, or lost\nshare of customer opportunities if the company cannot capitalise on the differentiated\ncustomer needs (SAP 2003).\nCompanies which effectively link their customer and supply chain operations gain\ncompetitive advantage by differentiating not only the products and services, but also the\nunderlying delivery processes. They have the capability to satisfy different customer needs\nwith differentiated supply chain capabilities and, as a consequence, can lower prices on\nofferings that are of great value to the customer. Based on a thorough understanding of the\ntotal supply costs on a customer-by-customer basis, supply chain managers know which\norders should get preferential treatment and can develop service packages geared towards\ncustomer needs and the value they bring to the company (Deloitte 2002). By closely linking\nthe supply chain with different customer segments, these companies can more proactively\naddress emerging and changing customer needs, reduce the time-to-market, and improve\nthe product and service lifecycle management.\nCooper et al. 1997), yet logistics processes are an important part of SCM.\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n11 of 41\nIn summary, the argument for combining marketing and SCM strengths is compelling. The\nfact that still only a minority of companies appear to have effectively linked their demand and\nsupply activities could be influenced by the complexity of the tasks involved. A smooth\ninformation flow from the front-end customer interaction back into production is necessary,\nbut on its own is not sufficient. Instead, the influence of marketing activities on supply, and\nvice versa, have to be understood and coordinated (Lee 2001). For example, pricing,\npromotion, as well as product mix efforts influence delivery times and supply chain costs.\nConversely, supply chain costs dramatically impact on product profitability, and therefore the\nvolume-driven supply chain costs have to be considered in the customer value propositions.\nMoreover, a comprehensive integration combines not only the activities within one company\nbut can involve coordination across the entire supply chain. Integration across the supply\nchain leads to the development of customer-centred supply chains (Kuglin 1998). In a\ncustomer-centred supply chain, differing needs of the company\u2019s customer base are\nconsidered and met through the alignment of all value creating processes within the\norganisation and even across the activities of suppliers and distributors. Developing such a\ncustomer-centred supply chain is the main goal of the DCM approach.\nDEMAND CHAIN MANAGEMENT\nDespite the fact that DCM is a relatively new concept, it has already been defined in different\nways. Most importantly, a wider and a more restricted view of DCM can be distinguished. In\na broader sense, Selen and Soliman (2002) have defined DCM as \u201ca set of practices aimed\nat managing and co-ordinating the whole demand chain, starting from the end customer and\nworking backward to raw material supplier\u201d. Similarly, Vollmann and Cordon (1998) stress\nthat DCM starts with the customers, working backward through the entire chain, to the\nsuppliers of the supplier. Hence, everything that is moved, handled or produced should\nideally be in response to a known customer requirement. Equally, Baker (2003) stresses that\nmanaging a demand chain is fundamentally different from managing a supply chain. It\nrequires turning the supply chain on its head, and taking the consumer as the starting point,\nrather than its final destination. Treville et al. (2004) criticise these broader views because\nthey imply that the term demand chain could effectively replace supply chain, a change in\nnomenclature which they see as undesirable. Hence, they propose a more narrow definition\nof DCM. Based on the distinction between the efficient physical supply and the market\nmediation roles of supply chains proposed by Fisher (1997), Treville et al. suggest restricting\nthe term to market mediation supply chains. In these responsive demand chains for products\nwith innovative demand, supply chain efficiency is traded off for customer service. Rainbird\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n12 of 41\n(2004) also maintains the distinction between the demand chain and the supply chain. He\nsees them as two distinct entities and proposes the term value chain as the overarching\nconcept which comprises both the demand and the supply chain (p. 242). However, when he\ndefines demand management as \u201can understanding of current and future customer\nexpectations, market characteristics, and of the available response alternatives to meet\nthese through deployment of operational processes\u201d, he merges the demand and supply\nchain aspects.\nWe share the concern over potential confusion, if the term supply chain were to be replaced\nby the term demand chain. However, countering the argument of Treville et al. (2004), we\nhold that even in markets where supply chain efficiency is the basis for competitive\nadvantage, demand should always be linked with supply. In line with Rainbird (2004), we\nacknowledge the fact that demand and supply processes are overlapping but can still be\ndistinguished. Therefore, we suggest that demand chain management is the concept which\naims to integrate demand and supply orientated processes. Demand processes are all\nprocesses at the customer or market interface, aimed at responding to customer demand\nthrough value creation. Traditionally, these processes are allied to the marketing discipline.\nSupply processes comprise the tasks necessary for fulfilling demand (Christopher and\nPayne 2002). Furthermore, we suggest viewing DCM as a macrolevel process which\nincludes all activities that companies undertake in their quest to create and deliver needs-\nbased customer value propositions.\nThe customer value-based theory of the firm (Slater 1997) is proposed as a suitable\ntheoretical foundation for demand chain management. The customer value-based theory of\nthe firm suggests that superior performance is a result of providing superior customer value.\nFirms need to organise themselves around understanding customer needs and customer\nvalue delivery processes. While marketing\u2019s contribution can be the knowledge on how\ncustomer needs are identified and customer value is created, SCM offers a suitable\nperspective on the organisation in todays markets. An organisation is composed of four\nmajor elements: participants, social structure, goals and technology (Leavitt 1965). The\ndemand chain just as the supply chain can be seen as an organisation which involves a\nvariety of participants who all hope to prosper based on their contribution to the chain and\nwho are brought together in the pursuit of goals. A social structure arises as these\nparticipants share information and coordinate their activities. Finally, technology refers to the\nprocess through which organisations accomplish tasks. Because the demand chain is\nbrought together for the specific purpose of facilitating customer value creating processes, it\nis very task oriented (Ketchen and Guinipero 2004).\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n13 of 41\nThe Study\nThe literature review revealed that relatively little attention to the DCM concept was paid\nfrom a marketing perspective. Whilst we will draw on the limited literature, we also\nconducted field research in order to explore the concept of DCM as well as the role of\nmarketing within DCM. The research method consisted of three consecutive phases: firstly,\ndata was collected through a co-development workshop in which we aimed to explore the\nprominent issues in DCM from a practitioner perspective and build those into a conceptual\nframework; secondly, a literature review in which we compared and contrasted the emerging\nthemes from the co-development workshop with the views held in the literature and, thirdly, a\nso-called \u2018discovery day\u2019, in which we discussed and validated the framework with further\ncompany representatives. Thus, in contrast to many conceptual frameworks, which have\nbeen derived solely from a literature review, our proposed concept of DCM is derived from\nboth, existing knowledge in the literature and field observations. Such an approach to\nconcept or theory development has been successfully applied in both relevant disciplines, ie\nin marketing (e.g. Kohli and Jaworski 1990; Workman et al. 1998; Homburg et al. 2000) and\nin SCM (e.g. Zsidisin 2003).\nThe co-development workshop involved eight companies with representatives from supply\nand demand functions within each company (marketing, sales, logistics and SCM). Supply\nand demand integration issues can only be captured if representatives from both sides within\nthe same company are involved. Our initial intention was to conduct paired interviews in\nselected companies. After the completion of a trial set of interviews, we noticed the\nlimitations related to the methodology. Rather than gaining knowledge on the elements of\nDCM, the interviewees elaborated on the barriers and problems, often making the other\nfunction responsible for integration failure. Therefore, we decided to involve both parties\nsimultaneously, and to facilitate constructive discussions in a co-development workshop.\nThe companies were chosen on the basis of proven expertise and interest in DCM. They\nrepresented a range of different industries, from oil and cosmetics to a manufacturer of\npersonal care products and a photoprinting technology provider. The workshop lasted one\nday and was run by Synectics, a consulting company which specialises in running such\nworkshops. Synectics applied a creative problem solving process which captured the\ndifferent mindsets of both functional representatives but then sought convergence. The\nprocess utilises brainstorming techniques, with an objective of leveraging both present\nknowledge and future potential. Its structure, with rigorous projective exercises, tools and\ntechniques, enables the participants\u2019 thinking to be shaped and developed. As researchers,\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n14 of 41\nwe acted as so-called \u201cproblem owners\u201d, which enabled us to choose the prominent topics,\nwhile leaving the process responsibility to the professionals.\nThe rich data from the workshop were captured through notes and an extensive number of\nflip charts. Since the workshop was not tape recorded, rigid coding along the guidelines set\nby Miles and Huberman (1984) or Yin (1994) could only be applied when analysing the\nwritten material. Through the coding, patterns that form content themes were identified and\nstructured into a framework. In order to validate the findings from the workshop, a summary\nreport was sent to all delegates and their agreement with the content was secured. Next, the\nemerging themes were compared and contrasted with the views held in the literature.\nFinally, a few months after the co-development workshop, the resulting framework was\nvalidated through discussion with further practitioners. In a so-called \u2018discovery day\u2019, the\nframework was presented to 14 delegates from a range of different industries as well as\nbusiness functions. The group then split into two smaller groups to discuss the framework, to\ngive examples or to suggest improvements. Both focus group discussions were moderated\nby the researchers who also attended the initial workshop. They were tape recorded and\ntranscribed for analysis. The focus group results provide sufficient support for two of the\ninitial elements of our framework. One element had to be substantially revised3.\nOverall, we recognise the limitations of our qualitative data collection approach. First, we\nemployed small, unrepresentative convenience samples and the results were not subjected\nto statistical analysis and are therefore not representative. However, because the purpose of\nthe study was theory construction, i.e. eliciting the main constructs and propositions of DCM\nand the role of marketing, we felt it was important to tap a wide range of experiences and\nperspectives. With theory building as the primary purpose of the field research, we do not\nintend to generalize the findings to any population but to unpack and explore the concept\nand the underlying propositions (Easton 1995). We are aware that qualitative interviews\ncarry the risk of misrepresenting the associated findings (Ellram 1996), and, therefore,\nconsiderable effort was given to validating the themes emerging from the co-development\nworkshop. With the co-development workshop and the focus group interviews from the\ndiscovery day, we ensured a \u201ctriangulation\u201d of perspectives. Triangulation is suggested as a\nsuitable way to increase the validity in qualitative research (Miles and Huberman 1994).\nMoreover, because little is known in DCM and the issues are complex, extensive interaction\nwith the respondents was necessary. In such situations, qualitative methods are suitable and\n3 The validating focus group discussions followed the first review of this paper. The suggestion of one\nanonymous reviewer to merge two of the originally four elements of the framework was adopted\nbecause it was also confirmed in the focus group results.\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n15 of 41\nthey allowed us to tap the \u201cmental maps\u201d and experiences of practitioners (Zaltman et al.\n1982; Calder 1994; Ellram 1996; Bonoma 1985). A final characteristic of our research\nmethod is the restriction of the focus to DCM from a company perspective. This does not\nnecessarily exclude suppliers or distribution partners; however, the viewpoint from the\ncoordinating company is taken. Collecting data for a cross-functional study is difficult, but\ncross-functional and interorganisational data collection seems almost impossible. Hence, at\nthis early phase, we opted for cross-functional data collection to explore the emerging\nconcept of DCM.\nA CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR DEMAND CHAIN MANAGEMENT\nBased on the analysis of the data from the co-development workshop, the discovery day and\nthe literature review, three integrative themes were identified and structured into a\nconceptual framework of DCM: (1) Process - managing the integration between demand\nand supply processes; (2) Configuration - managing the structure between the integrated\nprocesses and customer segments, and (3) Social interactions - managing the working\nrelationships between marketing and SCM. For each of the elements, the findings from the\nfield work and the supporting knowledge from the literature will now be outlined and,\nsubsequently, the propositions for further research in marketing are derived.\nInsert Figure 2 here\nProcess \u2013 Managing the Integration between Demand and Supply Processes\nAn important dimension of demand chain management which emerged from the co-\ndevelopment workshop is the need to integrate demand and supply processes. The\ndiscussion evolved more around the drivers and inhibitors of such a process integration\nrather than the actual integrated process as such. This could have been influenced by the\nfact that delegates had mixed experiences in their attempts to implement the process\nintegration within their organisations. One important driver stressed by the delegates is a\nprocess-driven business culture. Two managers from one company reported that functional\nheads were only willing to redefine their functional responsibilities when a board member\ncalled for commitment to cross-functional processes. In the literature, it is suggested that\nmarketing plays a vital role in process coordination (e.g. Min and Mentzer 2000; Srivastava\net al. 1999). However, our findings from the co-development workshop also suggest that\nmany marketing departments do not appear to be fulfilling this role. In most of the workshop\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n16 of 41\ncompanies, marketers are often preoccupied with revenue stimulation regardless of the\nimplications for SCM. Thus, both areas operate independently. Even the well-known\nproblems related to uncoordinated promotions were mentioned. Demand and supply\ncoordination was only experienced within venture projects. The supply chain representatives\nin particular appeared resentful because they felt dependent upon marketing\u2019s willingness to\ntrigger the process coordination through the dissemination of customer and market\ninformation.\nA further driver which emerged from the co-development workshop was the supporting role\nIT played in process integration. For example, one company used process reengineering\nand technology to synchronise its marketing and procurement. Both delegates from the\ncompany confirmed the benefits of a strong IT-based customer and supply chain integration\nfor demand forecasting, order scheduling and targeted marketing. The other delegates\nbemoaned the multiplicity of rigid and inflexible systems in their companies, which prevents\na demand-driven information flow across the functions. However, rationalising initiatives\nwere under way and led one delegate to conclude that the number of systems rationalised\nthrough IT infrastructure integration in his industry resembled those of the supplier\nrationalisation programmes about ten years ago.\nThe validating focus group discussions confirm both, the importance of integrated demand\nand supply processes as well as the supporting role of IT. The differences in the current\nstate of practice between the participating companies were substantial. Whereas one\ndelegate from an international food production company presented the thorougly integrated\nand IT supported process with aligned demand plan, inventory plan, production plan by\nfactory and a purchasing plan, another delegate simply commented that the morning had\nbeen eye opening because he looked at all the gaps in their own company\u2019s process.\nProcess integration as the first dimension of DCM is also sufficiently supported by the\nliterature and the argument for demand and supply process integration was addressed within\nmarketing as well as SCM. In the marketing field, the three core processes of CRM, SCM\nand new product development identified by Srivastava et al. (1999) reflect the demand and\nthe supply side. While the authors emphasise that the processes need to be integrated, the\nintegration is not discussed. Similarly, Payne and Christopher (2002) argue that CRM and\nSCM processes have to be integrated in order to \u201cprovide high levels of product availability\nand variety, yet which are low cost and reliable\u2026\u201d (p. 501). While they provide guidelines for\nboth processes independently, the integration is depicted at a highly abstract level. Those\ncontributions conceptualising SCM from a process perspective have also stressed the need\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n17 of 41\nto integrate the key business processes within and between organisations (e.g. Cooper et al.\n1997; Lambert and Cooper 2000; Mentzer et al. 2001). A wide range of business processes\nare suggested by different authors, including, among others, demand and supply-related\nprocesses. Still, the integrative frameworks proposed are developed to stimulate new\nresearch rather than guiding the specific issue of demand and supply integration. In this\nsense, Mentzer et al. (2001) suggest the investigation of how the processes can be\neffectively coordinated within a company and across the supply chain as an area for future\nresearch (p. 20).\nWhilst the argument for a process integration in the fieldwork as well as the literature is\nstrong, not much advice is given on how the processes can be integrated. Only one recent\nstudy by Rainbird (2004) is explicitly suggests a process fusion model for demand and\nsupply process integration. He distinguishes between eight supply processes, ranging from\norder receipt\/entry to delivery options, as well as seven demand processes, e.g. macro-\nmarket definition and CRM. Rainbird argues that the \u201cfusion\u201d or linkage between these\nprocesses can be achieved through either management, specific organisational capabilities\nor technology. Building on this work, we suggest a three layered process integration model,\ncomprising the customer buying life cycle and the demand and supply processes (see figure\n3).\nInsert Figure 3 here\nThe three layers of the model stress firstly, the integration of the customer into the value\ncreation process as proposed by Woodruff (1997). Secondly, in line with the concept-\nualisations of relationship marketing and CRM, the buying cycle acknowledges the dynamics\nin customer relationships (Zablah et al. 2004). Thirdly, by linking the activities in the demand\nprocess with those in the supply process, guidance to implementing the process integration\ncan be derived. Any process can usually be divided into subprocesses and activities and\ntherefore, the level of abstraction is arbitrary. In our model, the activity level was selected to\nmatch the phases in the customer buying cycle, and, furthermore, to illustrate those activities\nwhose integration is fundamental for DCM.\nAwareness expresses the customer\u2019s recognition of a need which can trigger a value\ncreation process for the company. In this phase, activities in the demand and supply\nprocesses are geared towards the preparedness and \u201chousekeeping\u201d within both areas.\nDemand tasks comprise market analysis, macro market segmentation, as well as the\ndefinition of target markets, or, in the case of repeat purchases from existing customers,\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n18 of 41\ntarget market approval actions. On the supply side, the existing supply network has to be\nmonitored against the market information provided by the demand process. This will\ncompromise common activities such as a supplier evaluation based on the supply\nrequirements derived from the market positioning of the company.\nOnce the customer is considering buying from the company within the evaluation phase, the\naccuracy of forecasting and demand planning is increased. In addition to the quantitative\nforecast, in the demand process customers are microsegmented based on needs,\npreferences and likely profitability. The supply process uses the information on customer\nsegment-based delivery needs in order to plan the specific supply chain responses. This will\ncomprise a range of common supply chain activities such as materials requirement planning,\ncapacity management or production planning and scheduling. On the demand side, value\nprofiles are developed by quantifying for each segment the \u201cideal\u201d customer value model,\nincluding the benefits, costs and value imperative drivers (Rainbird 2004). On the supply\nside, important inputs into the potential customer value models are, for example, pipleline\ncosts or delivery options. Therefore, integration into the demand process is facilitated if the\nsupply side proposes service delivery package options as input into the value profiling.\nIn the decision and purchasing phases demand and supply integration is put to the proof.\nSimply stated, all the marketing effort which has been put behind the product or service will\nfail if it is not available when the customer requires it. The relevant supply tasks are captured\nin the physical distribution service concept developed by Mentzer et al. (1989) with its three\ndimensions of availability, timeliness and delivery quality. The authors argue that recognition\nshould be given to the fact that each individual customer\u2019s needs along these three\ndimensions may vary. Moreover, from a demand chain perspective, the objective is not\nprimarily to make the sale, but rather to maintain a portfolio of profitable customers.\nTherefore, the goal is neither to generally serve customers better, nor to serve them\ncheaper, but to sell and deliver on the basis of a thorough understanding of customer needs,\nprofit potential and supply capabilities required. Close integration should ensure that the\ncompany profitably meets different customer needs with differentiated supply chain\ncapabilities.\nWhen the customer consumes or uses the product or service, the marketing activities range\nfrom supporting activities such as installation, financing, or warranty, to simply providing\ninformation and advice and can be summarised as \u201cserving the value\u201d Rainbird (2004).\nSince the supply activities have to support customer service, demand and supply tasks\noverlap. For example, offerings such as product return, exchange or disposal tasks are\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n19 of 41\ntypically carried out by supply functions. Moreover, and consistent with the CRM philosophy,\nan important objective of the post-sale phase is to \u201cbuild\u201d the relationship through cross- and\nupselling offerings. Renewed awareness and consideration of the cross- and upselling\nofferings on behalf of the customer will close the buying cycle. In order to build the customer\nrelationship profitably, feedback on over- or underdelivery, as well as information on\ncustomer profitability enables supply functions to develop revised service packages. For\ninstance, customers who contribute less to profitability can be migrated to more appropriate\nservice packages, for example, longer lead times or reduced after sales support.\nConsistent with the findings from the field work, the literature also proposes information\nmanagement and technology as a key enabler of the process integration (Koudal and\nWellener 2003). The design of information systems should be derived from the integrated\ndemand and supply process requirements, and, at the same time, support that integration. In\npractice, this is an exceedingly challenging task. The literature, as well as the findings from\nour workshop, supports the notion that information systems are often a result of the evolution\nand serving of discrete needs of functional lines rather than the key business processes.\nTherefore, IT solutions can reinforce \u201cwalls\u201d between functions rather than helping to\novercome them (Korhonen et al. 1998).\nFrom a DCM perspective, information systems have to support tasks such as identifying for\neach order, whether an item is purchased via catalogue, call centre, direct sales force or the\nwebsite. In addition, customer information such as sales history and profitability needs to be\navailable along with product availability for their specific requirements. This implies the\ncoordination of procurement, manufacturing and logistics data with multi channel customer\ninteraction data. The underlying CRM systems on the demand side and SCM tools on the\nsupply side are available, yet rarely integrated. On the demand side, CRM technology is\nwhat propelled relationship marketing to the forefront, enabling firms to collect and store\nunprecedented amounts of customer data and then feed the knowledge back into\ncustomised offerings, product improvements as well as sales and marketing campaigns\n(Zablah et. al. 2004). Although the impact of technology on CRM has been questioned, there\nis still no doubt of its enabling role for the demand process (Bose 2002). Similarly, the role of\ninformation systems in SCM integration is widely acknowledged (see Gunasekaran and Ngai\n2004 for a review). SCM applications typically have a number of functions, among them a\nforecasting functionality, analytics tools to calculate operational costs as well as\ncollaboration tools to connect parties in the supply chain. These components aim to increase\nthe information flow and thereby improve the visibility throughout the pipeline (Christopher\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n20 of 41\n1998). Without the ability to \u201csee\u201d actual demand and subsequently to manage\nreplenishment, ideally in virtual time, the supply chain will depend on inventory.\nManaging the digital integration within DCM goes beyond the disconnected functionalities of\nCRM and SCM tools. The demand and supply process integration suggests further IT\nrequirements: information technology must support the company\u2019s capability to serve\ndifferentiated customer segment based requirements by providing the ability to search for\nand develop alternative supply scenarios.\nTo summarise, the tentative empirical findings as well as the literature review suggest that\nprocess integration is an important dimension of DCM. Furthermore, the role of marketing is\nto facilitate the process integration by disseminating market information, to consider the\neffect of marketing activities from an integrated process perspective and to foster a demand\nbased integration of information needs. Thus, we can formally state the following\npropositions:\nProposition 1:\nThe role of marketing within DCM is to facilitate process integration by disseminating\ncustomer and market information.\nProposition 2:\nThe role of marketing within DCM is to consider the effect of marketing activities from an\nintegrated process perspective.\nProposition 3:\nThe role of marketing within DCM is to foster a demand rather than a supply based\nintegration of information needs.\nConfiguration \u2013 Managing the Structure between the Integrated Processes and\nCustomer Segments\nA second dimension of a DCM framework which we elicited from the field work is the need to\nmanage the demand chain configuration. Managing the demand chain configuration\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n21 of 41\ncomprises the strategic decision on the number of customer segments the company can\nserve with differentiated supply chains as well as the structural aspect of a customer\nsegment focused demand chain organisation. The configuration dimension is closely related\nto the process dimension, however, the delegates clearly made the distinction between\nconfiguration and process and the respective tasks. This distinction is consistent with the\nopen social system perspective, which suggests that processes in a system are organised\naccording to the system structure (e.g. Katz and Kahn 1980). In SCM, the configuration\ndimension is often referred to as \u201csupply chain design\u201d (e.g. De Kok and Graves 2003).\nIn the co-development workshop, delegates confirmed the need for a customer segment\nfocused demand chain organisation but stressed the difficulties involved in implementing it.\nOnly one company had experience in aligning customer needs with differentiated supply\nchain responses. Within the company manufacturing photoprinting technology, the\ndevelopment of a new product was recognised to require a supply chain approach different\nfrom the company\u2019s current approach. As a consequence, a cross-functional venture team\nwas set up which comprised marketing as well as SCM. Both representatives confirmed that\nthe co-ordination enabled the company to identify the target markets for the new product and\nat the same time develop the supply chain to compete in those markets. Interfaces between\nboth functions were mapped through processes, and a capacity planning model was used as\na facilitator. The venture team was a forum within which the drivers of marketing and supply\nstrategies communicated and, as a delegate remarked: \u201cthe spirit of a small business could\nbe captured\u201d.\nIn the focus group discussions, several further interesting examples of the challenges\nrelating to the alignment of customer segments and supply chains were highlighted. For\nexample, a paper production company served five substantially different customer segments\nwith varying demands on design, quality, delivery and volume. Interestingly, the company\nsought ways to decrease the complexity while maintaining the variety. Whereas in the past,\nthe company had tried to push the standard range of products and delivery terms by\n\u201ccontrolling the customer\u201d, it now seeked to develop standardised supply chains for each of\nthe customer segments. Another delegate stressed that they had to set up specialised\nsupply chains for their global strategic customers. Such a \u201csegment of one\u201d approach was\nnecessary because their product supply had to feed right into the customer\u2019s global point of\nsales and supported the customer\u2019s marketing activities. All delegates reported that it was\nnot only a challenge to deal with different supply chains but that the complexity was further\nincreased by the need to respond to changing customer needs. A delegate from an\nengineering company, which traditionally supplied customers from a range of industries, had\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n22 of 41\nrecently started to serve two big truck manufacturers. He stressed that a completely new\nsupply chain had to be set up for these customers and this involved a substantial\norganisational change process. A further issue which was stressed by several delegates was\nthe hindering role played by manufacturing in a customer-aligned structure. Manufacturing\nfacilities often seem to be specialised, focusing on product capabilities and are not aligned to\ncustomer segment needs. Therefore, product efficiency oriented manufacturing plans can\nimpede the efficient supply to different customer segments. A final issue discussed was the\ndegree of complexity which can be handled. One delegate mentioned that they had\noutsourced the entire production for their so-called \u201cstandard segment\u201d because they were\nunable to service highly customised and standard customer segments at the same time.\nThe need for a supply chain configuration based on customer segments is also supported by\nthe literature. Initially, the focus was on tailoring logistics to match individual customer or\ncustomer segment needs (e.g. Fuller et al. 1993; Murphy and Daley 1994). The argument\nthat logistics needs to be differentiated to fit specific customer needs has recently been\nsupported empirically (Mentzer et al. 2004). Within a SCM context, the case for product or\nmarket specific supply chains was first argued by Fisher (1997). Based on a distinction\nbetween functional or innovative products on the one hand and physically efficient or\nresponsive supply chains on the other hand, a matrix with viable product-supply chain\ncombinations was proposed. More recently, this initial segmentation was extended by\nChristopher and Towill (2002) and Childerhouse et al. (2002), who propose extended\ntaxonomies comprising criteria such as: product (standard or special), demand (stable or\nvolatile), lead times (short or long), volume (high volume or low volume) and time windows\nfor delivery (short or long) as a basis for market specific supply chain development.\nWhile most of the contributions to date are of a conceptual nature, Godsell and Harrison\n(2002) have conducted a case-based empirical study exploring the alignment of functional\nsegmentations within a manufacturing company of cleaning products. Interestingly, they find\nthat while the manufacturer applied three approaches to segmentation: a customer, a\nproduction and a logistics approach, none of them were linked. Table 1 illustrates the\ndifferent segmentation approaches applied:\nInsert Table 1 here\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n23 of 41\nLike many companies in today\u2019s world of key account management and CRM, the\nmanufacturer segments the customers on the basis of the value to the company of the\ncustomer accounts. In addition, a secondary classification by channel type is applied to the\nlong tail of field sales. The authors argue that such a segmentation is not suitable to develop\na customer behaviour-driven supply chain configuration. Furthermore, the production and\nlogistics segmentations are independent, which is reflected by the internal organisation\nstructure that separates manufacturing and logistics activities. Whereas manufacturing\nmakes some distinction between promotional and standard products, at subsequent stages\nwithin the supply chain, the products are treated exactly the same. The logistics\nsegmentation between quick and standard response is derived from the logistics strategy\nwhich offers customers these different services. However, at the time of the study, only three\naccounts used the quick response service. Finally, the segmentation approaches applied\nwithin the external supply chain, for example at the sourcing level, are entirely different\nagain. These sobering results lead the authors to conclude that the challenges of reflecting\ncustomer segmentation in internal supply chains are substantial and that the problems of\nalignment across the external supply chain could be too great.\nThe complexity emerging from changing customer value perceptions has also been\nidentified in the literature. For example, Flint et al. (1997) suggest a model to support\nresearch into customer value change and distinguish between three triggers: supplier\nlocated changes, customer located changes and environment located changes. Whilst such\na structure can facilitate a proactive perspective, the authors admit that some events will be\npredictable but some will not. In the empirical study by Heikkil\u00e4 (2002) mentioned above, a\nfurther finding addressed the linkage between the demand chain structure and its\nresponsiveness to customer value change. Here, the importance of efficiency as a DCM\nobjective appeared to increase when the structure of the demand chain is relatively stable.\nInterestingly, his findings suggest that a certain level of maturity in the structure is a\nprecondition, not only for optimising it, but also for developing the capability to respond to\nnew end-customer value propositions. Moreover, in order to disseminate a market sensing\ncapability, processes need to be institutionalised, which is more likely to be the case in a\nmore mature structure.\nWe conclude that a first area for further research relating to the configuration dimension of\nDCM is to investigate how the customer segments within companies can be linked with\nsegment supporting, responsive supply chains. Compared with the traditional approach to\nmarket segmentation, the role of marketing requires the integration of an \u201cexternal\u201d\ncustomer-facing and an \u201cinternal\u201d supply chain perspective on segmentation. While the\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n24 of 41\nincrease in available information enables companies to respond to individual customer\nneeds or to microsegment them into smaller and smaller groups, from a demand chain\nperspective, this granularity can cause problems. Tentative knowledge suggests that going\ntoo far in individualising offerings is likely to cause a lack of integration between a\nproduction-driven supply chain and a customer-driven value definition. Especially in\ncompanies where rich sources of information on buying behaviour has led to \u201cdatabase\u201d\nsegmentation rather than market segmentation (Baker 2003), balancing customer\nsatisfaction with supply chain efficiency is a major challenge. Secondly, more research is\nneeded which looks at how companies can translate their market sensing skills and the\nability to develop new customer value propositions into structural adaptation requirements\nfor the supply chain.\nBased on our tentative empirical findings and the literature review we suggest the following\npropositions relating to the role of marketing in demand chains:\nProposition 4:\nThe role of marketing within DCM is to link external, customer-value segmentation with\ninternal, segmentation of production, logistics and sourcing.\nProposition 5:\nThe role of marketing within DCM is to obtain knowledge about changes in customer needs\nas a basis for structural adaptation requirements of the supply chain.\nSocial Interactions - Managing the Working Relationships between Marketing and\nSCM\nProcess and configuration tasks in DCM are inextricably linked to the underlying social\ninteractions. A lack of integration between marketing and SCM appeared to be widespread\nin many companies from the field work, and was seen as a major barrier to implementing\nDCM.\nIn the co-development workshop, the soft issues were discussed extensively. Delegates\nused the metaphor of aligning \u201cspin\u201d with \u201cfact\u201d, emphasising that marketing stands for\ncreativity, experimentation, uncertainty and energy, whereas the culture in SCM is\ncharacterised by operational details, processes, workflows and data. Moreover, the mutual\ndistrust, the thinking as \u201cthem and us\u201d, as well as the prejudices of \u201cnumber crunchers\u201d and\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n25 of 41\n\u201cbox movers\u201d versus \u201csales hunters who can never say \u2018no\u2019 to any customer\u201d were discussed\nas barriers to cooperation. One delegate reported that the mistrust was overcome in a job\nrotation exercise when the former head of marketing moved into an operations role.\nThe practitioners from marketing and SCM agreed that communication was essential and\ndiscussed what information would need to be exchanged. Among the information sought\nmost urgently from marketing by SCM was new customer and product opportunities, defined\ncustomer segments, planned promotions as well as feedback on over- or underdelivery.\nMarketing, in turn, emphasised the need for timely information on lead time, capacity and\npipeline costs (inventory carrying costs, warehousing, transportation costs) (see figure 4).\nStill, delegates stressed that the information flow was a necessary but not a sufficient\ncondition for the cross-functional working relationship. A shared understanding of the\ninformation and, moreover, the ability to act on the same information were seen as being\npivotal. For example, one delegate mentioned the limitations of enterprise resource planning\nprogrammes. Although they are designed to enable all departments to see the same\ninformation, he said it inhibits rather than facilitates the integration because the readily\navailable data leads to uncoordinated actions.\nA further barrier to cooperation which emerged from the co-development workshop was\nconflicting key performance indicators (KPIs) between marketing and SCM. Among the main\nKPIs reported by marketers were market share, sales revenue, gross margin and\nfurthermore problems were created by a widespread trend to increasing product diversity\nand customisation. For supply chain managers, performance is measured against inventory\nturnover and value, cost control, decreased number of stock keeping units (SKU) and\ncustomer service. Workshop delegates agreed that the drive towards functional excellence\nin their companies has led to an increase of functional KPIs. Especially when the reward\nsystem is closely linked to these conflicting KPIs, the coordination between demand and\nsupply is at risk. A reduction of the number of relevant KPIs, the linkage of these KPIs to the\noverall business performance, as well as a certain flexibility enabling the company to adapt\nthe KPIs to respond to market forces, were among the solutions developed to overcome this\nbarrier to cross-functional cooperation.\nInsert Figure 4 here\nThe need to manage the interfunctional relationships has already been emphasised within\nSCM (e.g. Mentzer et al. 2001); however, the growing need for customer-value based\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n26 of 41\nsegmentation is likely to further increase its importance within demand chains. Thus, cross-\nfunctional working relationships are critically related to the company\u2019s ability to prioritise\ncustomers according to the internal supply capabilities of the company. Furthermore, studies\nhave shown the positive effect of cross-functional cooperation on perceptions of customer\nperceived value and customer service (Fisher et al. 1997). Managing the relationship\nbetween marketing and SCM involves creating incentives for all parties to help manage the\nflow of customer and demand information.\nWithin the literature, only a small number of empirical studies of the relationship between\nmarketing and SCM can be traced. Ellinger (2000) finds empirical support for the hypothesis\nthat marketing and logistics cooperation has a positive impact on distribution service\nperformance, i.e. the ability to customise service offerings to customer needs. His findings\nsuggest a positive association between effective marketing and logistics interdepartmental\nrelationships and distribution service performance. Effective interdepartmental relationships\nare found to be influenced by the evaluation and reward system. However, the results also\nindicate that the relationships in the more than 300 companies surveyed were not\nparticularly effective. As a consequence, Ellinger suggests that further research should\ninvestigate the antecedents of marketing and logistics cooperation. Next, an empirical study\nby Murphy and Poist (1996) analyses marketing and logistics managers\u2019 views regarding\ninterface-cooperation. Cooperation refers to a relationship in which both the marketing and\nlogistics functions experience a high level of satisfaction. The findings show that 53% of the\nlogistics respondents and 49% of the marketing respondents rated the present level of\ncooperation between their functions to be only \u201cslight\u201d or \u201cmoderate\u201d. Communication\nbarriers were perceived as by far the major obstacle to better cross-functional cooperation.\nAmong the most frequently used techniques to facilitate cooperation were top management\nsupport, joint projects, information sharing and attempts to instill a philosophy of cooperation.\nFinally, Kahn and Mentzer (1998) investigated interdepartmental integration between\nmarketing, manufacturing and R&D managers. Their findings suggest that integration has\ntwo components: interaction and collaboration. Interaction emphasises the use of\ninformation exchange activities and has no direct effect on a range of performance outcomes\n(e.g. department performance, satisfaction in working with other departments). Collaboration\nhowever, which implies a mutual understanding, a common vision and collective goals, has\na direct positive impact on performance.\nWe conclude that an area for further research is to analyse the cross-functional relationship\nbetween marketing and SCM. While this research can build on the findings from existing\nstudies on interfunctional relationships, we agree with Kahn and Mentzer (1998), as well as\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n27 of 41\nEllinger (2000), who suggest that more research is needed which identifies the antecedents\nof marketing and SCM cooperation. Our literature review and tentative empirical findings\nsuggest that a mutually satisfying relationship between both functions has two levels: a first,\nbasic level of information exchange and communication, which is a necessary yet not a\nsufficient condition for the second level of collaboration. Collaboration between marketing\nand SCM implies a mutual understanding and collective goals. On the first level, information\nexchange, more research is needed to identify which information needs to be shared. Our\nfindings from the workshop (which are summarised in figure 4) emphasise that it is not the\nraw sales data but rather the knowledge which should be communicated. For the second\nlevel of collaboration, the KPI appears to be a major inhibitor or facilitator for collective goals.\nOur findings propose that manufacturing and supply chain managers who are rewarded on\nthe basis of costs view customisation of products, product variety and delivery options as\nthreats to their performance. Instead, collaborative KPIs focus on a broader set of collective\ncompany objectives rather than evaluating functions on discrete or conflicting performance\nmeasures. Finally, achieving a mutual understanding of the information is possibly the most\nchallenging aspect of marketing and supply collaboration. One delegate reported an\noccasion in his company where exactly the same information was provided to marketing and\nSCM, but as they interpreted it in different ways, the operational implications drawn were\ntotally different. In the literature, the dissimilar workstyles and functional cultures are often\ncited as barriers to collaboration. Our own findings suggest that these rational reasons are\nfrequently part of a vicious circle with mutual emotional resentment.\nWe offer the following propositions relating to the role of marketing in managing the working\nrelationship with SCM:\nProposition 6:\nThe role of marketing within DCM is to proactively exchange information with SCM.\nSpecifically it should provide timely information on: defined customer segments; new\ncustomer\/product opportunities; planned promotions; feedback on over\/under service\ndelivery and, furthermore, seek information on: lead times, capacity and pipeline costs.\nProposition 7:\nThe role of marketing within DCM is to seek collaboration with SCM by working towards a\nmutual understanding of the information exchanged and collective goals.\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n28 of 41\nSUMMARY\nIn today\u2019s markets, understanding the customer\u2019s situation and responding effectively to\ndiffering needs through the coordination of marketing and SCM can be a source of superior\ncustomer value creation. This paper has introduced DCM as a model which combines the\nstrengths of marketing and SCM by shifting the focus to the customer and designing\ncustomer-centred supply chains. Marketing is traditionally externally focused and creates\ncustomer value, while SCM is inwardly focused and concentrates on the efficient use of\nresources in implementing marketing decisions. Marketing and SCM integration is hence\nbetween those that define demand with those who fulfill it. Until today, the concept of DCM\nhas been addressed from SCM and operations perspectives; however, despite its clear\nrelevance, no marketing contribution can be cited. By outlining the roles of marketing in\ndemand chains, the paper closes this gap and proposes several important new areas for\nfuture research in marketing.\nWidely cited examples of successful companies following the principles of DCM, such as\nDell in the computer industry or Zara in the fashion industry (Walker et al. 2000 and\nMargretta 1998), lead us to believe that more companies will adopt DCM in their quest to\ngain competitive advantage. These companies increase profitability through product\navailability, delivery accuracy, responsiveness and flexibility by tightly linking customer and\nsupply initiatives. Within DCM, marketing and SCM work together to develop suitable\nrelationships for different customers, develop joint customer prioritisation strategies, process\naccurate customer information and match value requirements with operational capabilities.\nOur conceptual framework suggests new roles for marketing within DCM which imply new\nareas for research (see table 2).\nInsert Table 2 here\nThe role of marketing within DCM also suggests a re-evaluation of the role of marketing\nwithin companies. Marketing has traditionally served as the boundary discipline between the\nfirm and the customer and markets (Day 1992). However, critical voices stress that this is\noften done to the detriment of the company\u2019s internal efforts (Barret 2004). From a DCM\nperspective, marketing needs to involve the knowledge of other departments into their\ndecision making and redefine (and possibly limit) its responsibilities within the integrated\ndemand and supply process. Marketers need to strategise with SCM to create new ways to\ngo to the market, understand and translate marketing initiatives into supply chain drivers and\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n29 of 41\nimprove their awareness of the company\u2019s operational constraints. Collaboration between\nSCM and marketing needs to ensure that SCM is involved in the marketing planning at an\nearlier stage, is involved in customer priority decisions and, most importantly, needs to be\nable to reject marketing decisions if they are not financially viable to the business. On the\nother hand, marketing must become more cost driven and less inclined to agree to sales that\nare not optimal for the business. Our findings from the workshop as well as the focus group\ndiscussions suggest that marketing will be resistant to changes and might blame SCM\u2019s lack\nof a market orientation for integration failure. We agree that SCM has to focus more on the\ncreation of output and we also see the enabling role of a market orientation for SCM\nimplementation (Min and Mentzer 2000). Still, and distinct from former contributions on the\nrole of marketing within SCM, we argue that the success of DCM is not only based on a\nmarket driven philosophy but on strong marketing and SCM competencies. Therefore,\ncompanies with strong customer and SC initiatives, as well as a process culture, are best\nsuited to link both in an integrated DCM approach.\nThe fact that DCM seeks to explain competitive advantage illustrates the close relationship\nbetween the concept and strategic management. Within marketing (e.g. Day 1992,\nVaradarajan 1992) as well as the SCM literature (e.g. Ketchen and Giunipero 2004), the\ninterface with strategic management is discussed. Because strategic management aims at\nidentifying, explaining, and predicting the determinants of organisational performance (e.g.\nSchendel and Hofer 1979) and needs to match customer requirements with the value\nproposition of the firm (Cravens et al. 1997), both disciplines suggest that they have much to\noffer. We argue that the intersections of strategic management and DCM should not have an\nunderlying internal competition for primacy. Instead, they can be mutually beneficial and the\ncontribution of DCM can be substantial because it combines the knowledge of two\ndisciplines in its endeavour to understand the processes by which superior customer value is\ncreated and delivered.\nIMM Manuscript 04-225\n30 of 41\nReferences\nAchrol, R.
