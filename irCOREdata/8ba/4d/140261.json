Nanostructured thin films and coatings\npossess properties different to homogenous materials due\nto the deliberate engineering of nanoscale features into\nthe structure. The seven papers presented in this special\nedition examine the challenges faced in fabricating nanoscale\nsystems and composites, as well as the electrical and light\ninteractions that occur with such small-scale systems\nIn the first paper, glass plate-supported nanostructure\nZnO thin films were deposited by sol-gel spin coatings.\nThe ZnO thin films are transparent ca 80-90% in visible\nrange, and have absorption edge at about 370 nm. The c-axis\norientation improves and the grain size increases, which was\nindicated by an increase in intensity of the (002) peak at 34.40\nin XRD corresponding to the hexagonal ZnO crystal. The\nphotocatalytic degradation of X6G, an anionic monoazo dye,\nin aqueous solutions was investigated, and the effects of some\noperational parameters such as the number of layers and\nreusability of ZnO nanostructure thin film were examined.\nThe results showed that the five-layer coated glass surfaces\nhave a very high photocatalytic performance.\nIn the second paper, the microstructure and photocat-\nalytic performance of titania coatings obtained by different\nthermal spray techniques were investigated: atmospheric\nplasma spraying (APS), suspension plasma spraying (SPS)\u2014\nalternative plasma spray technique using liquid feedstock\nmaterial and the high-velocity oxygen fuel spray process\n(HVOF). Various titania powders were used as feedstock\nmaterials for spraying. Different TiO2 nanopowder suspen-\nsions were carried out to study the influence of the solvent\nnature on the coating characteristics. The photocatalytic\nefficiency of the elaborated samples was tested in an environ-\nmental test chamber setup and evaluated from the gaseous\nnitrogen oxide (NO, NOx) removal.\nIn the third paper, the structural, optical, and conduc-\ntivity properties of silicon film deposited on cerium dioxide\nbuffer layer were studied. The data of Raman scattering mea-\nsurements, scanning electron microscopic experiments, and\nelectrophysical measurements were used. The temperature\nspatial distribution and cerium dioxide phase conditions play\na great role in silicon crystallization. Applied external electric\nfield was used to destroy the crystal structure order in silicon.\nCrystal phase of silicon film was restored by annealing\nthe samples. The field destruction of crystal phase and\nits restoration after annealing were investigated by Raman\nspectroscopy.\nIn the fourth paper, a study was concentrated on prepa-\nration and structural characterization of granular Ag-ZrO2,\nCo-ZrO2, and Au-ZrO2 thin films grown by pulsed laser\ndeposition (PLD) in a wide range of volume fraction x of\nmetal (0.08 < xAg < 0.28, 0.06 < xCo < 0.40, and 0.08 < xAu\n< 0.55). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy\n(HRTEM) showed regular distribution of spherical Au, Co,\nand Au nanoparticles having very sharp interfaces with\nthe amorphous matrix. The structural results are compared\naiming to stress the effect of the actual microstructure\non the percolation threshold. Two different mechanisms\nof particle growing as a function of the metal content\nare evidenced: nucleation and particle coalescence, with\n2 Journal of Nanomaterials\ntheir relative significance depending strongly on the type of\nmetal, giving rise to very different values of the percolation\nthreshold (xc(Ag)\u223c0.28, xc(Co)\u223c0.35, and xc(Au)\u223c0.55).\nIn the fifth paper, inorganic thin films (hydroxide,\noxide, and phosphate materials) that are textured on a\nsubmicron scale have been prepared from aqueous metal\nsalt solutions at room temperature using vapor-diffusion\ncatalysis. This generic synthesis approach mimics the essen-\ntial advantages of the catalytic, and structure-directing\nmechanisms observed for the formation of silica skeletons\nof marine sponges. Chemical composition, crystallinity, and\nthe three-dimensional morphology of thus prepared films\nare extremely sensitive to changes in the synthesis conditions,\nsuch as concentrations, reaction times and the presence and\nnature of substrate materials. Focusing on different materials\nsystems, the reaction mechanism for the formation of these\nthin films and the influence of different reaction parameters\non the product are explained.\nIn the sixth paper, chromium metal-induced nanocrys-\ntallization of amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin films is reported.\nThe nanocrystalline nature of these films is confirmed from\nX-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Significantly, the\ndeconvolution of Raman spectra reveals that the thin films\nwere crystallized in a mixed phase of cubic diamond and\nwurzite structure as evidenced by the lines at 512 and\n496 cm\u22121, respectively. The crystallite sizes were between\n4 and 8 nm. Optical properties of the crystallized silicon,\nderived from spectral transmittance curves, revealed high\ntransmission in the region above the band gap. Optical band\ngap varied between 1.3 and 2.0 eV, depending on the nature\nof crystallinity of these films, and remained unaltered with an\nincrease in Cr addition from 5 to 30%. This signifies that the\nelectronic structure of the nanocrystalline silicon films is not\naffected considerably inspite of the presence of metal silicides\nand the process of crystallization.\nIn the final paper, the thermomechanical stresses acting\nbetween a nanotube and fullerenes encapsulated on it are\ncomputed. After a general formulation, based on elasticity,\nthe analysis suggests that a thermal control could be used to\nproduce smart fullerenes at nanotube systems, for example,\nas two-stage nanovectors for drug delivery.\nPing Xiao\nRobert Dorey\n"}
