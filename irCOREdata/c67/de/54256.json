It is found that interpolative SDMs may switch \nfrom unstable to stable behaviors even though the magnitude or the frequency of the \ninput sinusoidal signals increase. Hence, the input magnitude stability margin and the \ninput frequency stability margin are redefined as the minimum input magnitude and \nthe minimum input frequency of the input sinusoidal signals such that the output of \nthe loop filter is bounded. \n \nI. Introduction \nInterpolative sigma delta modulators (SDMs) are systems that consist of a \nnegative feedback of a loop filter and a quantizer, as shown in Figure 1. The quantizer \nis usually very coarse and a single bit quantizer is the most common one employed in \nindustries [1]. An input signal is oversampled and the most common oversampling \nratios are 32, 64, 128 and 256 [1]. As a result, the signal band is very narrow. If the \nquantizer is modeled by an additive white Gaussian noise source, then the loop filter \n 2\ncan be designed in such a way that the closed loop noise transfer function in the signal \nband is small. As a result, the quantization noise can be separated from the input \nsignal and a very high signal-to-noise ratio can be achieved even though a very coarse \nquantizer is employed. This working principle refers to the noise shaping \ncharacteristics. Since interpolative SDMs can achieve very high signal-to-noise ratios, \nthey are found in analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversions of many circuits \nand systems, particularly in audio systems [1]. \nIt was reported in [2] that the loop filter should be designed to be an unstable \none in order to achieve very high signal-to-noise ratios. However, in this case the \noutput of the loop filter may be unbounded. For most of interpolative SDMs \nemployed in industries, the output of the loop filter would diverge as the magnitude of \nsinusoidal inputs increases. Hence, the input magnitude stability margin of \ninterpolative SDMs is usually defined as the magnitude of the sinusoidal inputs that \nthe output of the loop filter changes from stable to unstable behaviors. \nThere are some fundamental issues that have not been investigated yet. For \nexamples, does there exist a unique input magnitude, denoted as 0U , such that the \noutput of the loop filter would change from stable to unstable behaviors? If no, then \nhow can we define the input magnitude stability margin? Similarly, does there exist a \nunique input frequency, denotes as 0\u03c9 , such that the output of the loop filter would \nchange from stable to unstable behaviors? If no, then how can we define the input \nfrequency stability margin? This paper is to address these issues. The outline in this \npaper is as follows. In Section II, our main results will be presented. Finally, a \nconclusion is summarized in Section III. \n 3\n \nII. Main results \nDenote ( )ku , ( )ky , ( )ks , ( )zF  and ( )yQ  as the input of interpolative \nSDMs, the output of the loop filter, the output sequence of interpolative SDMs, the \ntransfer function of the loop filter and the quantizer, respectively, as shown in Figure \n1. Assume that ( )zF  is rational, real and strictly causal with a delay element in the \nnumerator of the transfer function. We make these assumptions because of \nimplementation reasons and the feedback loop configuration. Denote A , B , C  \nand D  as the state space matrices of ( )zF . Then 0=D . We also assume that the \ndecision boundary of a single bit quantizer is at the origin, that is \n( )\n\u23a9\u23a8\n\u23a7\n\u2212\n\u2265\u2261\notherwise1\n01 y\nyQ , because this single bit quantizer is the most common one \nemployed in industries [1]. Define ( )kx  as the state vector of the interpolative SDMs. \nThen the dynamics of the interpolative SDMs can be represented by the following \nstate space equations: \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( )kskukk \u2212+=+ BAxx 1 , (1a) \n( ) ( )kky Cx= , (1b) \nand \n( ) ( )( )kyQks = .

This realization, initial condition and the filter coefficients are the most \ncommon ones employed in audio systems [1]. Figure 2 to Figure 7 show the state \nresponses and the output of the loop filter when \n96\n\u03c0\u03c9 =  and 59.0=U , 591.0=U , \n592.0=U , 593.0=U , 594.0=U  and 595.0=U , respectively. It can be seen from \nFigure 2, Figure 4 and Figure 7 that the state responses and the output of the loop \nfilter are bounded when 59.0=U , 592.0=U  and 595.0=U , respectively, while it \ncan be seen from Figure 3, Figure 5 and Figure 6 that the state responses and the \noutput of the loop filter are unbounded when 591.0=U , 593.0=U  and 594.0=U , \nrespectively. Hence, there does not exist a unique input magnitude 0U  such that the \noutput of the loop filter will change from stable to unstable behaviors. \n \nFigure 2.

State responses and the output of the loop filter when 595.0=U  and \n96\n\u03c0\u03c9 = . \nSimilarly, Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the state responses and the output of the \nloop filter when 59.0=U  and \n95\n\u03c0\u03c9 =  and \n97\n\u03c0\u03c9 = , respectively. It can be seen \nfrom Figure 8 and Figure 9 that the state responses and the output of the loop filter are \nunbounded. However, as we have shown in Figure 2 that the state responses and the \noutput of the loop filter are bounded when \n96\n\u03c0\u03c9 =  and 59.0=U . Hence, there does \nnot exist a unique input frequency 0\u03c9  such that the output of the loop filter will \nchange from stable to unstable behaviors. \n 8\n \nFigure 8.

State responses and the output of the loop filter when \n97\n\u03c0\u03c9 =  and \n59.0=U . \n 9\nSince there do not exist unique input magnitude and input frequency such that \nthe output of the loop filter will change from stable to unstable behaviors, the input \nmagnitude stability margin and the input frequency stability margin are redefined as \nthe corresponding minimum values that the output of the loop filter is bounded. \n \nIII. Conclusion \nIn this paper, some interesting nonlinear phenomenon on the stability of \nsinusoidal responses of interpolative SDMs is observed. It is found that the input \nmagnitude and the input frequency such that the output of the loop filter will change \nfrom stable to unstable behaviors are not unique. Hence, the input magnitude stability \nmargin and the input frequency stability margin are redefined as the corresponding \nminimum values that the output of the loop filter is bounded. \n \nAcknowledgment \nThe work obtained in this paper was supported by a research grant from Queen \nMary, University of London. \n \nReferences \n[1] D.
