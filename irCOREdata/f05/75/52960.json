Anomalies arising from the magnetic \ncharacter of rocks in the earth\u2019s crust have revealed many \naspects of earth processes and geodynamics, and mapping \nthem comprehensively has been an integral part of many \nAntarctic expeditions for more than fifty years.  \nThe first generation of the magnetic anomaly map of \nAntarctica reveals terranes of varying ages, including \nProterozoic-Archaean cratons, Proterozoic-Palaeozoic \nmobile belts, Palaeozoic-Cenozoic magmatic arc systems \nand other important crustal features (Golynsky et al., \n2006a).  The map delineates intra-continental rifts and \nmajor rifts along the Antarctic continental margin, the \nregional extent of plutons and volcanics, such as the \nFerrar dolerites and Kirkpatrick basalts.  \nThe ADMAP database was produced from air, \nshipborne and satellite magnetic observations by the \ninternational working group of the Antarctic Digital \nMagnetic Anomaly Project (ADMAP).  More than 1.5 \nmillion line-kilometres of near surface magnetic \nrecordings were used in the construction of the map \n(Golynsky et al., 2001).  The compilation merged \navailable magnetic survey data collected by the \ninternational community from the IGY 1957-58 to 1999. \nMerging the accumulated anomaly data from marine, \naeromagnetic and satellite observations provides a unique \ncontinental-scale magnetic anomaly view on the tectonic \nevolution of the Antarctic crust. \nAt present, the ADMAP Working Group is working to \ni) develop a DVD with its point data compilation up to \n1999 for release to the World Data Centers, ii) implement \nADMAP\u2019s protocols and to maintain and update the \ndatabase as new magnetic survey data become available, \niii) improve models of the Antarctic core field, iv) \ncompile rock magnetic and other physical properties to \nsupport geological applications of the ADMAP database, \nand v) support the World Magnetic Anomaly Map \ninitiative of the International Association of \nGeomagnetism and Aeronomy. \nNew data sets \nSeveral international programs have focused on the \nfirst-order geophysical mapping of tectonic and geologic \nstructures in the interior of East Antarctica and along its \n10th International Symposium on Antarctic Earth Sciences \n2 \ncontinental margins.  As shown in Figure 1, they have \nresulted in a large amount of aero- and shipborne \nmagnetic surveying since the end of the last century.  \n \nFigure 1. Line coverage of recently acquired near surface \nmagnetic surveys used in this study.  Map projections \nthroughout this paper are polar stereographic.  The \ncoastline is from the Antarctic Digital Database.  See \nTable 1 for survey specifications. PCM \u2013 Prince Charles \nMountains. \nOne of the largest aeromagnetic datasets was collected \nby the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) over western \nDronning Maud Land (DML) and its continental margin \nsince the austral summer of 1996\/97 (Jokat et al., 2003). \nWithin the East Antarctic Margin Aeromagnetic and \nGravity Experiment (EMAGE) project, a total of 90,000 \nkm of aeromagnetic data were acquired along a 1200 km \nlong segment of the East Antarctic coast.  The aircraft \nflight pattern between 18\u00b0W and 8\u00b0E was extended by \ntwo helicopter surveys (~20,000 km) during the \n1999\/2000 season.  \nTraditionally the Indo-Antarctic continental margin is \nthe sphere of scientific interest of Australian, Japanese, \nand Russian researchers who conducted several recent \ncruises into this region.  The programs of the Polar \nMarine Geological Research Expedition (PMGRE, \nRussia) and Geoscience Australia (GA) acquired an \nintegrated geophysical survey dataset including seismic, \ngravity and magnetic information of more than 50,000 \nand 20,000 line-km, respectively, along the continental \nmargin of East Antarctica, west of the Astrid Ridge to \nGeorge V Coast of Victoria Land (Gandyukhin et al., \n2006, Stagg et al., 2005).  Similar sets of geophysical data \nwere collected by the Norwegian\/Russian and Japanese \nexpeditions in the Cosmonaut and Cooperation Seas (e.g. \nJoshima et al., 2001).  \nAeromagnetic flights over East Antarctica have \nconcentrated in the major regions of the Transantarctic \nMountains (TAM), the Prince Charles Mountains-\nLambert Glacier area, and western Dronning Maud Land \n\u2013 Coats Land. Additionally two surveys were acquired \nover Lake Vostok and in the western part of Mary Byrd \nLand. The majority of these projects ultimately succeeded \nin simultaneously operating and integrating laser \naltimetry, ice-penetrating radar, gravity, and magnetics \naboard survey aircraft\/helicopters (Figure 1; Table 1).  \nMap compilation \nEvaluation of the creditability of any magnetic \nanomaly compilation depends on characterizing the input \ndata and procedures used for their processing. The \nprocessing of recently acquired data was achived in \nseveral consistent steps.  First, the processing of all \nrecently acquired shipborne surveys by the PMGRE were \nre-examined.  The magnetic data were edited for high-\nfrequency errors, levelled and adjusted, and the data \nquality assessed by statistical analysis of the crossover \nerrors.  The mean square error (MSE) for these datasets \nvaried from 2.5 to 12.0 nT, and suggested that these \nshipborne surveys were some of the highest quality of any \ncarried out in the Antarctic.  \nPre-processing of the GA and Norwegian track-lines \nallowed us to create a new dataset of only the recently \ngathered GA, NPD and PMGRE information.  The \nsubsequent cross-over analysis showed that they are \nlevelled accurately. An internal adjustment of unified data \nset was performed iteratively by applying to the GA and \nNPD lines constant magnetic offsets derived from a cross-\nover analysis.  The MSE of the combined dataset does not \nexceed 11.9 nT.  This result would not be possible in the \nabsence of the tie-lines conducted by the PMGRE within \nindividual surveys and between neighboring surveys.  \nThis result ensured us that the new unified dataset can be \nused as a base net for the subsequent levelling of other \ninformation collected by international institutions along \nthe East Antarctic continental margin. \nThus, a new compilation for the marine study area was \nproduced which contained the above mentioned datasets, \nthe Japanese (JARE40-42, TH98-99) lines, and all \nprevious ADMAP marine magnetic profiles.  An internal \nadjustment of the data set was done in similar way to the \nearlier line-network adjustment.  Successive data gridding \nand imaging was used to examine the spatial correlation \nof magnetic lines and to identify the erroneous lines that \nmay produce extreme distortions of magnetic anomalies. \nLevelling the united dataset for the entire study area \nreduced the initial MSE from 60.8 to 20.6 nT.  \nThe patchwork merging of recently acquired \naeromagnetic data with the ADMAP surveys requires \nlevelling adjustments.  These procedures were treated \nindividually according to whether the survey data were \navailable in grid form or as profiles.  Large overlapping \nareas between the PMGRE and PCMEGA profile data in \nthe Prince Charles Mountains (PCM) region allowed us to \nGolynsky et al.: New magnetic anomaly map of East Antarctica and surrounding regions \n 3 \ndetermine a datum shift between individual surveys rather \naccurately (138 nT). The irregular networks of older \nregional profiles over the Transantarctic Mountains were \nre-levelled using the CTAM project data.  Other sets were \nknitted together by their overlapping areas. The final \ncompilation merged the aeromagnetic and marine grids to \ncreate the master grid over East Antarctica and \nsurrounding areas with minimal mismatch between the \ndata sets along their boundaries as shown in Figure 2. The \nadjusted magnetic data were interpolated onto a 5 km grid \nusing a minimum curvature algorithm.  \nLithospheric magnetic anomalies were extracted from \nCHAMP satellite data and merged with ship and airborne \nmagnetic surveys compiled within this study. Employing \nspectral correlation theory to filter the static lithospheric \nfield components from the dynamic external field effects, \nwe processed the CHAMP satellite magnetic observations \nfor an improved magnetic anomaly map of the Antarctic \ncrust.  These results greatly facilitate predicting magnetic \nanomalies in the regional data coverage gaps (Kim et al., \nin press). \nTable 1.

Aeromagnetic data collected by the AWI \nalong the eastern Weddell Sea and Riiser-Larsen Sea \ncontinental margins provide new constraints on the timing \nand geometry of the early Gondwana breakup (Jokat et \nal., 2003). \nResults of the compilation do not radically alter recent \nmodels describing first-order motion between the \nAntarctic, Australian and Indian plates, but they help \nresolve uncertainties about the early break-up histories of \nopening between these plates.  It is highly likely that \nspreading in the Enderby Basin occurred around the same \ntime as anomalies M10 to M0 were formed off the Perth \nBasin, Western Australia (Gandyukhin et al., 2006; Gaina \net al., 2003).  The history of the early spreading is \ncomplicated by the likelihood of one or several ridge \njumps in which most of early seafloor crust was \ntransferred to the Antarctic plate.  Additionally, a large \namount of the oceanic crust is now probably overprinted \nby igneous activity associated with the Kerguelen Plume, \nwhich began forming the Kerguelen Large Igneous \nProvince from about 120-110 Ma.  \n \nFigure 2. New colour shaded-relief magnetic anomaly \nmap of East Antarctica and surrounding regions. \nIllumination is from the North at an inclination of 45\u00b0. \nEBA - the Enderby Basin Anomaly. See Plate 1 for large map.\n10th International Symposium on Antarctic Earth Sciences \n4 \nAmong other noteworthy peculiarities of the magnetic \nfield is the curvilinear belt of positive magnetic anomalies \nrunning parallel with the coast of Enderby Land and \nMacRobertson Land, which we have named the Enderby \nBasin Anomaly (Figure 2).  It extends from the western \nmargin of Kerguelen Plateau up to the Gunnerus Ridge \nand appears to be associated with the continent-ocean \nboundary identified on the basis of seismic data. \nOver the continent, the new data allow us to recognize \npreviously unknown magnetic features and patterns \nincluding pronounced magnetic lineaments and trends that \nreveal, for example, the spatial extent of Ferrar volcanics \nand plutonic Granite Harbour Intrusives in the TAM and \nother unknown tectonic trends of the East Antarctic craton \n(Ferraccioli et al., 2005; Golynsky et al., 2006b; Studinger \net al., 2003, 2006).  Regional aeromagnetic investigations \nhave been successful in delineating Early Paleozoic \ninherited crustal features along the flanks of the West \nAntarctic Rift System (Finn et al., 1999; Ferraccioli et al., \n2002).  The new magnetic data help characterize the sub-\nice geology south of the PCM and define more accurately \nthe southern boundary of the Archean Ruker Terrane.  \nConclusions \nRecent magnetic anomaly data acquired by the \ninternational community over the East Antarctica and \nsurrounding regions upgrade the ADMAP compilation \nsubstantially.  More than 500,000 line-km of new airborne \nand shipborne data have been matched by inversion to \nminimize the data differences within overlapping areas. \nThese results provide a new and uniform window through \nwhich tectonic structures and lithologies of the East \nAntarctic Shield can be studied.  The new map also shows \nwhere gaps in the data coverage still remain, thereby \nfocusing the attention on areas where new data \nacquisitions would significantly enhance our knowledge \nof the Antarctic craton.  \nAcknowledgments.
