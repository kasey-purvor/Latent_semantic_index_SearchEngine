Introduction\nThe dramatic advances made in genetic and molecular biology in recent years have\nallowed us to produce detailed descriptions of a number of complex processes that\narise on many different spatial and temporal scales during development. This unpar-\nalleled flood of experimental data may well enable us to understand how genes and\nproteins work collectively in a cell, and from this how multicellular organisms de-\nvelop. But, therein exists one of the great challenges of modern science; all too often\nCurrent Topics in Developmental Biology, Vol. 81 0070-2153\/08 $35.00\n\u00a9 2008, Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved DOI: 10.1016\/S0070-2153(07)81006-4183\n184 Baker et al.\nour knowledge remains in isolated pockets, lacking a conceptual framework tying the\nfragmented data together and allowing ideas and hypotheses to be explored. This is\nwhere mathematical modeling can play a fundamental role, comparable with any labo-\nratory research tool: it allows us to combine the effects of multiple nonlinear processes\ninto a coherent structure which can be used for hypothesis testing and making experi-\nmentally testable predictions.\nSomitogenesis, the segmentation of the vertebrate anteroposterior (AP) axis, is a\nperfect paradigm for studying such issues (Gossler and Hrabe\u02c7 de Angelis, 1998); it has\na long history of experimental investigation at the cellular level, and we have observed\nrecently a huge explosion in the rate of identification of the underlying molecular\ncomponents. Somitogenesis serves as a model process for studying pattern forma-\ntion during embryogenesis, encompassing a wide range of mechanisms and processes,\nsuch as the role of biological clocks (Dale et al., 2003, 2006; Dale and Pourqui\u00e9, 2000;\nMaroto and Pourqui\u00e9, 2001; Pourqui\u00e9 1998, 2001b), positional information gra-\ndients (Diez del Corral et al., 2002, 2003; Diez del Corral and Storey, 2004;\nDubrulle et al., 2001; Dubrulle and Pourqui\u00e9, 2002, 2004b), cell migration and ad-\nhesion (Drake and Little, 1991; Duband et al., 1987; Duguay et al., 2003; Kulesa and\nFraser, 2002), all of which are tightly coupled, both spatially and temporally.\nSomites are tightly bound blocks of cells that lie along the AP axis of verte-\nbrate embryos (Gossler and Hrabe\u02c7 de Angelis, 1998; McGrew and Pourqui\u00e9, 1998;\nPourqui\u00e9, 2001b). They are transient structures, and further differentiation of the\nsomites gives rise to the vertebrae, ribs and other associated features of the trunk.\nSomites segment from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM); thick bands of tissue that lie\non either side of the notochord, along the AP axis. At regular time intervals, groups of\ncells at the anterior ends of the PSM undergo changes in their adhesive and migratory\nbehavior and condense together to form an epithelial block of cells known as a somite\n(Stockdale et al., 2000). As a result, somites form in a very strict AP sequence. As the\nbody axis extends, the budding of cells anteriorly is compensated by the addition of\ncells at the posterior ends of the PSM (Pourqui\u00e9, 2003). Each band of the PSM stays\napproximately constant in length throughout the process of somite formation and a\nwave of patterning appears to sweep along the AP axis leaving the somites in its wake\n(Collier et al., 2000).\nFrom the molecular point of view, formation of the somites begins with the es-\ntablishment of a prepattern of gene expression. In mouse and zebrafish, members\nof the Mesp family are periodically activated in regions corresponding to the fu-\nture somites (Haraguichi et al., 2001; Morimoto et al., 2006; Saga et al., 2001;\nTakahashi et al., 2000; Takashi et al., 2005). Overt signs of segmentation occur during\nsubsequent cell cycles when the prepattern is converted to morphological somites.\nCells undergo changes in their adhesive and migratory properties and a series of\nextensive rearrangements and shape-changes, mediated by cell adhesion molecules\n(CAMs), take place (Drake and Little, 1991; Duband et al., 1987; Duguay et al., 2003;\nFoty and Steinberg, 2004; Kalcheim and Ben-Yair, 2005).\n6. Models for Somite Formation 185\nAlthough the physical somite boundaries form at the anterior-most end of the\nPSM, early scanning microscope images showed that the PSM is not a homoge-\nneous tissue (Meier, 1979; Tam and Meier, 1982). Prior to somite formation early\nsigns of segmentation were seen: the posterior PSM was shown to display metameric\narrangements of cells known as somitomeres, which seem to be precursors of the\nsomites (Gossler and Hrabe\u02c7 de Angelis, 1998; Jacobson and Meier, 1986). The ex-\nistence of this prepattern was confirmed by microsurgical experiments in which iso-\nlated parts of the PSM formed somites in strict isolation (Chernoff and Hilfer, 1982;\nPackard, 1976). However, this somitomeric prepattern was shown to be undetermined\nand susceptible to modification by external agents (Packard et al., 1993). More re-\ncently, existence of the prepattern has been further contested by microsurgical experi-\nments conducted by Dubrulle and co-workers: AP inversions of somite-length regions\nof the posterior PSM resulted in normal segmentation whilst inversions of the anterior\nPSM resulted in somites with reversed polarity (Dubrulle et al., 2001). These results\nsuggest that the anterior-most portion of the PSM is determined with regard to its\nsegmentation program, whilst the posterior-most portion is labile in this respect. The\ndifferent regions of the PSM were found to correspond to regions of varying FGF\nsignaling; we discuss this more in following paragraphs.\nThere are several genes expressed dynamically in the PSM. Some are known as\ncyclic genes, because they oscillate with the same frequency it takes to form one\nsomite (Dale et al., 2006; Ishikawa et al., 2005; McGrew et al., 1998; Palmeirim\net al., 1997; Pourqui\u00e9, 2001a, 2003). In the chick, gene expression bands of c-hairy1\nand l-fng sweep along the AP axis: beginning as wide bands in the tail end of the\nembryo, they narrow as they travel in an anterior direction, until they come to rest in\nthe newly forming somite. Expression is considered to arise as a result of an under-\nlying segmentation clock in the PSM cells: several cell-autonomous components of\nthe clock have been identified (Aulehla and Johnson, 1999), together with other mole-\ncular pathways which couple the oscillations in neighboring PSM cells (del Barco\nBarrantes et al., 1999; Jiang et al., 1998, 2000; Jiang and Lewis, 2001; Pourqui\u00e9, 1999;\nRida et al., 2004).\nAn additional gene with dynamic expression in the PSM is fgf8. A gradient of FGF8\nexists along the AP axis, peaking at the posterior end of the embryo (Dubrulle et al.,\n2001 Dubrulle and Pourqui\u00e9, 2002, 2004a, 2004b). As the body axis elongates, the\ngradient of FGF8 moves in a posterior direction so that it stays at a constant axial level,\nrelative to the PSM. Cells are initially part of a region where FGF8 signaling prevails,\nbut they gradually exit this region as they move up through the PSM. Dubrulle and\nco-workers have shown that downregulation of FGF signaling is necessary for cells to\nbecome part of a somite, and they term the threshold level of FGF signaling at which\nthis ability is gained the determination front (Dubrulle et al., 2001).\nFollowing the experimental discoveries described above, Pourqui\u00e9 and co-workers\nhave postulated that it is the interaction between the segmentation clock and the FGF8\ngradient that gates the cells into somites: the segmentation clock defines when somite\nboundaries form, whilst the FGF8 gradient defines where they form (Dubrulle et al.,\n186 Baker et al.\n2001; Tabin and Johnson, 2001). This is now the generally accepted \u201cmodel\u201d for\nsomite formation.\nII. Models for Somite Formation\nIn this section we will present a number of mathematical models which describe dif-\nferent stages of the formation of somites. We begin by presenting a mathematical\nformulation of the Clock and Wavefront model, which integrates information from\nthe segmentation clock and the FGF8 wavefront to produce a somitic prepattern. Next\nwe consider individual models for the segmentation clock and FGF8 gradient, which\nmay be integrated into the Clock and Wavefront model. Finally we present a model\nwhich includes the role of cell adhesion molecules and the cell rearrangements which\ntake place during the generation of epithelial somites. In each case we introduce the\nmodel and its mathematical formulation. We show the results of numerical simula-\ntions, discuss the successes and shortcomings of the model and avenues for extension\nand refinement.\nA. The Clock and Wavefront Model\nWith the recent experimental findings concerning the existence of a segmentation\nclock and a wavefront of FGF8 along the AP of vertebrate embryos, the Clock and\nWavefront model has received a large amount of support. First proposed by Cooke and\nZeeman (Cooke, 1975, 1998; Cooke and Zeeman, 1976; Zeeman, 1974), the model\nassumed the existence of a longitudinal positional information gradient along the AP\naxis which interacts with a smooth cellular oscillator (the clock) to set the times at\nwhich cells undergo a catastrophe. In this context, Cooke and Zeeman were referring\nto the changes in adhesive and migratory behavior of cells as they form somites.\nPourqui\u00e9 and co-workers recently proposed a revised version of the model which\ninvolves the interaction of the segmentation clock and FGF8 wavefront in gating the\ncells into somites (Dubrulle et al., 2001; Tabin and Johnson, 2001). Specifically, they\nassume that the clock sets the times at which new somite boundaries form whilst the\nposition of the determination front sets where they form (Dubrulle et al., 2001). We de-\nveloped a mathematical formulation of the Clock and Wavefront model based on these\nassumptions (Baker et al., 2006a, 2006b). We also made the following further assump-\ntions: (i) upon reaching the determination front, a cell acquires the ability to segment\nby becoming competent to produce a somitic factor\u2014which could be, for example,\nMesp2 (Morimoto et al., 2006; Saga et al., 2001; Takashi et al., 2000, 2005)\u2014in re-\nsponse to the presence of a signaling molecule; (ii) one clock oscillation after reaching\nthe determination front, cells become able to produce the signaling molecule; (iii) after\nresponding to the signaling molecule, a cell is specified as somitic and becomes re-\nfractory to FGF8 signaling; (iv) a cell forms part of a somite with nearby cells which\nproduce somitic factor at a similar time.\n6. Models for Somite Formation 187\nFigure 1 The mechanisms underlying somite formation. The lower box illustrates the AP axis and the var-\nious stages of somite formation. The posterior PSM (gray) is homogeneous and cells are undetermined with\nrespect to their developmental pathway. At the level of the determination front, the interaction between the\nclock and wavefront specifies the chemical prepattern. Cells of the PSM which lie anterior to the determina-\ntion front will follow a specific developmental pathway which cannot be altered by subsequent perturbation\nof the clock or wavefront. At the anterior end of the PSM cells undergo changes in their morphological\nproperties and condense to form coherent somites (black segments). The upper box shows schematics of\nthe networks underlying the clock and the gradient. On the left, FGF acts in a negative feedback loop with\nretinoic acid to control gradient progression whilst on the right a negatively-regulating transcriptional delay\nnetwork consisting of Hes1\/7 controls clock oscillations.\nOur mathematical model is based on the signaling model for somite formation,\noriginally proposed by Primmett and co-workers (Primmett et al., 1988, 1989), and\nthen developed by Maini and co-workers (Baker et al., 2003; Collier et al., 2000;\nMcInerney et al., 2004; Schnell et al., 2002). In this model (see Fig. 1), a small group\nof cells at the anterior end of the PSM will reach the determination front and undergo\na whole cycle of the segmentation clock. These pioneer cells produce and emit a\ndiffusible signaling molecule which spreads along the PSM. Any other cell which has\nreached the determination front, but not yet been specified as somitic, will respond\nto the signal by producing somitic factor. At this point the cell becomes allocated to\na somite along with other cells which are behaving in a similar manner. The process\nbegins once again when the new cohort of cells at the anterior end of the PSM becomes\nable to produce signaling molecule.\n188 Baker et al.\nThe mathematical model consists of a system of three nonlinear partial differential\nequations (PDEs). The variables are somitic factor concentration (only cells with a\nhigh level of somitic factor can go on to be specified as somitic), signaling molecule\nlevels and FGF8 concentration. We choose to model the gradient by assuming that\nFGF8 is produced only in the tail of the embryo and that it undergoes linear decay\n(see Baker et al., 2006a, 2006b, for more details). As the embryo extends the gradi-\nent regresses posteriorly, conferring the ability on cells to be able to produce somitic\nfactor. A time ts later cells gain the ability to produce signaling molecule; ts is the\nperiod of the segmentation clock. Somitic factor production is activated in response\nto a pulse in signaling molecule, which is emitted from cells at the anterior end of the\nPSM. However, rapid inhibition of signal production means that the peaks in signal\nconcentration are transient and produced at regular intervals: this ensures that a series\nof coherent somites is generated (McInerney et al., 2004).\nThe system of nonlinear PDEs can be written as follows:\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= (u + \u03bcv)\n2\n\u03b3 + u2 \u03c7u \u2212 u,\n(1)\u2202v\n\u2202t\n= \u03ba\n(\n\u03c7v\n\u03b5 + u \u2212 v\n)\n+ Dv \u2202\n2v\n\u2202x2\n,\n\u2202w\n\u2202t\n= \u03c7w \u2212 \u03b7w + Dw \u2202\n2w\n\u2202x2\n,\nwhere u represents the concentration of somitic factor, v the concentration of signaling\nmolecule and w the concentration of FGF8. \u03bc, \u03b3 , \u03ba , \u03b5, \u03b7, Dv , and Dw are positive\nconstants and production of u, v, and w are controlled by the respective Heaviside\nfunctions1\n\u03c7u = H(w \u2212 w\u2217),\n(2)\u03c7v = H\n(\nt \u2212 t\u2217(w\u2217, t)\n)\n,\n\u03c7w = H(x \u2212 xn \u2212 cnt),\nwhere w\u2217 is the level of FGF8 at the determination front, t\u2217(w\u2217, t) is the time at which\na cell at x reaches the determination front (i.e., w(x, t\u2217) = w\u2217), ts is the period of the\nsegmentation clock, xn is the initial position of the tail and cn represents the rate at\nwhich the AP axis is extending. In short, the system of PDEs describes the follow-\ning behavior: (i) somitic factor production is activated by the signaling molecule and\nis self-regulating; (ii) signaling molecule is produced rapidly in areas where somitic\nfactor concentration is low and it is able to diffuse along the AP axis; (iii) FGF8 is\nproduced in the tail, which is constantly regressing along the x axis.\nWe solve the mathematical model on the interval (\u2212\u221e,\u221e), where x \u2192 \u221e corre-\nsponds to the tail of the embryo and x \u2192 \u2212\u221e the head of the embryo. We assume\n1 The Heaviside function H(x) is equal to unity if x > 0 and zero otherwise: it acts as a switch.\n6. Models for Somite Formation 189\nFigure 2 Numerical solution of the clock and wavefront model in one spatial dimension given by Eqs. (1)\nand (2). Continuous regression of the wavefront (c), is accompanied by a series of pulses in the signaling\nmolecule (b), and coherent rises in the level of somitic factor (a). Parameters are as follows: \u03bc = 10\u22124,\n\u03b3 = 10\u22123, \u03ba = 10, \u03b5 = 10\u22123, \u03b7 = 1.0, \u03c6 = 0.0, Dv = 50, Dw = 20, xn = 0.0, cn = 0.5, xb = 7.5 and\n\u03be = 0.0.\nthat: (i) the levels of somitic factor, signaling molecule and FGF8 are bounded as\nx \u2192 \u00b1\u221e; (ii) initially the region x < 0 has already been specified as somitic; and\n(iii) the system is between pulses in the signaling molecule.\nThe mathematical model can be solved numerically using the NAG library routine\nD03PCF and the results plotted using the MATLAB function imagesc. The results\nare shown in Fig. 2. As time progresses, the region of high FGF8 signaling regresses\nalong the AP axis with constant speed. In its wake a series of pulses in signaling\nmolecule result in a series of coherent rises in somitic factor, enabling the formation\nof discrete somites.\nThe model has been tested against experimental data. Dubrulle and co-workers used\nexperimental techniques to make local perturbations to the FGF8 wavefront (Dubrulle\n190 Baker et al.\net al., 2001). By implanting beads soaked in FGF8 alongside or into the PSM they\ngenerated a series of somite anomalies. Typical anomaly patterns consisted of series\nof small somites ahead of the bead, followed by a large somite behind the bead and\nnormal segmentation thereafter. The mathematical model can be adapted to take this\ninto account by adding a term into the equation for FGF8, which represents a station-\nary source of FGF8 (Baker et al., 2006a, 2006b):\n(3)\u2202w\n\u2202t\n= \u03c7w + \u03c6\u03c7b \u2212 \u03b7w + Dw \u2202\n2w\n\u2202x2\n,\nwhere the term\n(4)\u03c7b = H(\u03be \u2212 xb + x)H(\u03be + xb \u2212 x),\nrepresents a source of FGF8 from a bead implant. \u03c6 is a measure of the strength of\nthe bead source, xb is the position of the bead and \u03be is a measure of the width of\nthe bead. The model can be solved as before, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. As\ntime progresses, the region of high FGF8 signaling regresses along the AP axis as in\nthe control case, but the speed of wavefront progression is disrupted around the bead\nimplant. This results in a series of small somites ahead of the bead and a large somite\nbehind the bead, as observed experimentally.\nThe model can also be adapted to include other possible experimental perturbations,\nsuch as downregulation of FGF8 signaling and perturbation of the segmentation clock\n(see Baker et al., 2006a, 2006b, for more details). Testing of these kinds of hypotheses\nis vital for furthering our understanding of the mechanisms underlying somite forma-\ntion.\nAt present the drawback to this kind of modeling approach is that the clock and\ngradient are modeled at a very high (phenomenological) level. We incorporate the\nsegmentation clock by using a single parameter to represent the period of the clock.\nLikewise, it is simply assumed that a generic FGF8 molecule makes up the gradient\ncontrolling the position of the determination front. Whilst this approach has many\nbenefits\u2014we can make simplifications and predictions regarding the effects of many\nexperimental perturbations (Baker et al., 2003, 2006a, 2006b)\u2014we are unable to in-\nfer exactly how each biological perturbation affects somite formation. For example,\nvitamin A deficient embryos have somites which are reduced in size (Diez del Cor-\nral et al., 2003; Molotkova et al., 2005; Moreno and Kinter, 2004). In our model we\ncould explain this observation by assuming that the determination front progresses\nmore slowly along the AP axis. This requires us to decrease the parameter cn, which\ncontrols the rate at which the Heaviside function controlling FGF8 production moves\n[see Eq. (2)]. However from our model, we cannot deduce why this change in cn oc-\ncurs. Explicit modeling of the segmentation clock and FGF8 wavefront will allow us\nto address these kinds of questions.\n6. Models for Somite Formation 191\nFigure 3 Numerical solution of the clock and wavefront model in one spatial dimension given by\nEqs. (1)\u2013(4). Continuous regression of the wavefront (c), is accompanied by a series of pulses in the sig-\nnaling molecule (b), and coherent rises in the level of somitic factor (a). With a source of FGF8 implanted\nin the PSM the somite anomalies are obvious. Parameters are as follows: \u03bc = 10\u22124, \u03b3 = 10\u22123, \u03ba = 10,\n\u03b5 = 10\u22123, \u03b7 = 1.0, \u03c6 = 1.5, Dv = 50, Dw = 20, xn = 0.0, cn = 0.5, xb = 7.5 and \u03be = 0.5.\nB. Transcriptional Regulation Models for the Segmentation Clock\nThe segmentation clock has been modeled using networks of transcriptional regula-\ntory modules (Giudicelli and Lewis, 2004; Hirata et al., 2004; Horikawa et al., 2006;\nLewis, 2003; Monk, 2003; Pourqui\u00e9 and Goldbeter, 2003). In each model, the simplest\npossible feedback loop is considered: binding of a transcription factor to the regulatory\nregion of its own gene inhibits expression (see Fig. 1). Such a model can be written in\nthe form\n(5)\ndp\ndt\n= am(t \u2212 \u03c4p) \u2212 bp(t),\ndm\ndt\n= f (p(t \u2212 \u03c4m))\u2212 cm(t),\n192 Baker et al.\nwhere p represents protein (transcription factor) concentration and m represents\nmRNA concentration. The models incorporate delays of length \u03c4p and \u03c4m to reflect\nthe time taken for synthesis of mature protein and mRNA, respectively. a is the rate\nof protein production, b and c are the decay rates of protein and mRNA, respectively,\nand the function f (\u00b7) is the rate of production of new mRNA molecules. To satisfy the\nrequirement that protein binding inhibits transcription, f (\u00b7) should be a decreasing\nfunction of p, which we assume to be\n(6)f (p) = k\n(1 + pn\npn0\n)\n,\nwhere k, n, and p0 are positive constants. In general we assume n = 2; this represents\nthe inhibitory action of a protein which acts as a dimer (Lewis, 2003).\nTo consider a more realistic model for the behavior of a single cell, Lewis also\nincludes a characteristic property of gene regulation: noise (Lewis, 2003). Binding and\ndissociation of the protein to\/from the regulatory DNA site is considered to behave\nin a stochastic manner (Turner et al., 2004). The regulatory site makes transitions\nbetween bound and unbound states with a certain probability; these probabilities can\nbe calculated by considering the rates of binding and unbinding and the numbers of\nprotein molecules in the cell.\nFig. 4 shows the results of simulation of the system. In Fig. 4a, we plot the results of\nnumerical simulation of the deterministic system using the MATLAB solver dde23.\nAfter initial large-amplitude oscillations in protein and mRNA levels, the system set-\ntles down to oscillate in a regular fashion with a period of approximately 50 minutes.\nThe remaining plots, Figs. 4b\u20134d, show the results of numerical simulation of the\nnoisy system. Simulations were carried out in the following fashion: at each time step,\na random number drawn from a uniform distribution was used to determine whether\nbinding or unbinding events occurred and then numbers of protein and mRNA mole-\ncules were updated accordingly. Fig. 4b is the stochastic equivalent of Fig. 4a\u2014the\nsystem oscillates in much the same manner as the deterministic case, with a similar\nperiod but a small amount of variability in peak levels of mRNA and protein. As the\nprotein synthesis rate is decreased the stochastic nature of gene regulation becomes\nmore prominent. The period of oscillation remains robust even at a tenth of its origi-\nnal value [see Fig. 4c] but the peaks become increasingly noisy. At 100th of its original\nvalue, the oscillations are hard to discern and protein numbers fluctuate randomly and\npersistently (see Fig. 4d) (Lewis, 2003).\nThese models neatly capture the dynamics of the segmentation clock and reproduce\noscillations with a period relatively close to that observed experimentally. The period\nof oscillation is robust in the sense that it remains practically unchanged even when\nthe rate of protein synthesis is drastically reduced (Pourqui\u00e9 and Goldbeter, 2003).\nHowever, this generally requires the Hill coefficient, n, to be higher than that reported\nexperimentally (Monk, 2003). In other words, one must assume that rather than a\ndimer, regulation of mRNA transcription requires binding of a multimer, such as a\ntetramer or larger, to the regulatory DNA site.\n6. Models for Somite Formation 193\nFigure 4 Numerical solution of the segmentation clock model given by Eqs. (5) and (6). (a) The case with\nno noise. (b\u2013d) The case in which binding of the protein to and from its site on the DNA are stochastic\nprocesses. As the rate of protein synthesis is gradually decreased the oscillations become more irregular,\nbecoming almost undetectable as synthesis rates reach 1\/100th of their original value. In each case protein\nconcentration\/number is indicated by the solid line and mRNA concentration\/number by the dashed line.\nParameters are as follows: dt = 0.1 min, \u03c4m = 12.0 min, \u03c4p = 2.8 min, p0 = 40, k = 33 min\u22121,\nkoff = 1 min\u22121, b = 0.23 and c = 0.23.\nThe models also assume that (i) translation is nonsaturating, (ii) the movement of\nprotein molecules between the cytoplasm and cell nucleus is instantaneous and (iii) the\ndelays in transcription and translation take discrete values. Monk (2003) suggests that\na more appropriate assumption would be that the delay is uniformly distributed on\nsome finite interval; this results in a revised equation for mRNA dynamics of the form\n(7)dm\ndt\n= a\n\u03c42\u222b\n\u03c41\nk(\u03c3 )f\n(\np(t \u2212 \u03c4)) d\u03c3 \u2212 bm(t),\n194 Baker et al.\nwhere\n(8)\n\u03c42\u222b\n\u03c41\nk(\u03c3 ) d\u03c3 = 1.\nOne prediction of the model is that oscillations are crucially dependent on instability\nof the protein. Hirata and co-workers (Hirata et al., 2004) generated mice expressing\nmutant Hes7 with a half-life of approximately 30 minutes (compared to approximately\n22 minutes in the wild-type mouse). Somite segmentation and oscillatory gene expres-\nsion became severely disorganized after a few cycles. This observation is consistent\nwith the results observed in their mathematical models and provides support for this\nmechanism in the segmentation clock. In a similar manner, Lewis uses his stochas-\ntic models to postulate that the effect of reduced protein synthesis may be to cause\nthe progressively irregular oscillations seen in mutant embryos (Jiang et al., 2000;\nLewis, 2003). It would be interesting to see if this could be tested experimentally.\nThe models discussed in this section consider oscillations in protein and mRNA\nnumbers in a single cell, where the environment has been assumed to be spatially\nhomogeneous. The reaction kinetics of gene transcription can vary substantially in\nspatially heterogeneous environments (Schnell and Turner, 2004; Turner et al., 2004).\nAlthough Lewis and Horikawa and co-workers briefly discuss models which incorpo-\nrate the role of the Notch\u2013Delta pathway in coupling adjacent PSM cells (Horikawa et\nal., 2006; Lewis, 2003), future work in this area will need to consider the possibilities\nof coupling large numbers of cells, as is the case with the segmentation clock.\nC. Models for the FGF8 Gradient\nLess well studied have been the mechanisms underlying maintenance of the FGF8\ngradient, which has been shown to control the position of the determination front\n(Dubrulle et al., 2001). Our mathematical formulation of the Clock and Wavefront\nmodel (Baker et al., 2006a, 2006b) assumed simply that FGF8 is produced in the tail\nof the embryo, which is extending at a constant rate. In our model, diffusion and linear\ndecay are combined to set up a monotonic gradient, which regresses along the AP axis\nas time proceeds and hence is a constantly moving determination front. In this case,\nthe rate of progression of the determination front is solely controlled by a parameter\nchosen in the simulations.\nWe consider a revised mechanism for FGF8 gradient formation (Baker and Maini,\n2007) based on the finding that FGF8 acts in a negative feedback loop with RA (Diez\ndel Corral et al., 2002, 2003; Diez del Corral and Storey, 2004). We show a schematic\nrepresentation of this feedback in Fig. 1. In the negative feedback loop, it is possible\nthat FGF8 might downregulate RA production or upregulate RA decay, or both. The\nsame occurs for RA. In order to account for both possibilities, we investigated the\n6. Models for Somite Formation 195\nFigure 5 Numerical solution of the FGF8\/RA model given by Eq. (9) over the series of successive time\nsteps t = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. The fronts move from left to right as time proceeds. Parameters are as follows:\nrf = 2.0, ra = 5.0, \u03bbf = 1.0, \u03bba = 1.0, \u03b7f = 0.5, \u03b7a = 0.5, sf = 0.5, sa = 0.5, \u03b2a = 1.0, \u03b2f = 1.0,\nand D = 5.0.\nphenomenon using the following system of nonlinear PDEs:\n(9)\n\u2202F\n\u2202t\n= rf F\n2\n1 + F 2\n\u03bb2f\n\u03bb2f + A2\n\u2212\n(\n\u03b7f + sf A\n2\nA2 + \u03b22f\n)\nF + D\u2202\n2F\n\u2202x2\n,\n\u2202A\n\u2202t\n= ra A\n2\n1 + A2\n\u03bb2a\n\u03bb2a + F 2\n\u2212\n(\n\u03b7a + sa F\n2\nF 2 + \u03b22a\n)\nA + \u2202\n2A\n\u2202x2\n,\nwhere F denotes the concentration of FGF8, A the concentration of RA and rf , ra , \u03bbf ,\n\u03bba , \u03b7f , \u03b7a , sf , sa , and D are positive constants. In briefly, the first equation assumes:\n(i) the rate of production of FGF8 is decreased by RA; (ii) FGF8 production saturates\nfor high FGF8 concentration; (iii) FGF8 undergoes linear decay; (iv) RA augments\nFGF8 decay; and (v) FGF8 diffuses at rate D compared to RA. Similar statements can\nbe made about the dynamics of RA.\nThe system of equations describing RA and FGF8 dynamics is mathematically in-\ntractable and so we carry out numerical simulation of the system using the MATLAB\nfunction pdepe, in order to analyze the behavior. Fig. 5 shows the results of numeri-\ncal simulation for a specific set of parameter values. The initial conditions are chosen\nso that FGF8 obtains its maximal value on the positive x axis and is zero elsewhere\nand vice versa for RA. In this case, traveling waves (constant shape) form, with the\nregion of high FGF8 signaling moving in a positive x direction at a constant rate. Vari-\nation of the model parameters produces changes in both wave speed and shape (Baker\nand Maini, 2007).\nDespite the fact that analytical solution of the system is impossible, it can be shown\nthat the presence of RA, acting in negative feedback loop with FGF8, makes the model\nmore robust. Robustness is meant in the sense that it increases the parameter range for\n196 Baker et al.\nwhich the wave moves in a positive x direction (since we wish the determination front\nto regress along the AP axis over time).\nGoldbeter and co-workers have also recently proposed a model for the FGF8 gra-\ndient which considers the negative interactions between RA and FGF8 (Goldbeter et\nal., 2007). In this model, negative feedback results in windows of bistability: regions\nalong the PSM in which both high and low levels of FGF8 signaling are possible.\nGoldbeter and co-workers postulate that the action of the clock within this window\ncould result in a shift from high to low levels of FGF signaling and the specification\nof a presumptive somite.\nAt present the model of Goldbeter and co-workers does not consider extension of\nthe AP axis or movement of the bistability window along the AP axis. Also it does\nnot explicitly consider interaction of the clock with this window in gating cells into\nsomites. On the other hand, our model does not explicitly couple gradient formation\nto the rate of AP axis extension. Moreover it needs to be coupled to our previous\nformulation of the Clock and Wavefront model in order to predict somite patterns.\nD. Models Including Cell Adhesion\nAll the models discussed thus far are concerned purely with the formation of a prepat-\ntern in gene expression, which is later converted to physical somites by a series of\nchanges in cell morphology. However, it is possible to write down a model capturing\nthe essential interactions between cells and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), which\nleads to formation of a series of peaks in cell density\u2014the somites. To date, the only\nmathematical model attempting to describe the bulk movement of PSM cells to form\na somite is by Schnell and co-workers (Schnell et al., 2002). This is an extension of\nthe signaling model for somite formation by Maini and co-workers, which we have\ndiscussed previously. Here we present a simpler model, which can explain the bulk\nmovements of cells to form a somite.\nLetting n denote cell density and a denote the concentration of a morphogen that\nstimulates expression of CAMs, the following system of nonlinear PDEs can be used\nto describe somite formation:\n\u2202n\n\u2202t\n= \u2202\n\u2202x\n[\n\u2202n\n\u2202x\n\u2212 f (n)\u2202a\n\u2202x\n]\n,\n(10)\u2202a\n\u2202t\n= D\u2202\n2a\n\u2202x2\n+ n \u2212 a.\nThe first term on the right-hand side of the equation for cell density represents cell dif-\nfusion and the second term the tendency of cells to move up gradients in CAM activity\n(resulting in cell aggregations). f (n) is a decreasing function of n which for illustra-\ntive purposes we take to be \u03c7n(N \u2212 n). The constant N is chosen to be large enough\nto ensure that f (n) does not become negative. The equation for morphogen concen-\ntration also contains a diffusion term, with diffusion of CAM-triggering morphogen\n6. Models for Somite Formation 197\nFigure 6 Numerical solution of the cell-chemotaxis model for somite formation in one spatial dimension\ngiven by Eq. (10). Initially the field is supposed to be homogeneous throughout, with a small perturbation\nmade to the cell density at x = 0. The pattern of somites propagates across the field over time, from left to\nright. Parameters are as follows: D = 1.0, \u03c7 = 10.0, N = 1.0 and n0 = 0.5.\noccurring at rate D relative to PSM cells. Production of CAM-triggering morphogen\noccurs at a rate proportional to the number of cells present, whilst we assume that no\ncell birth or death occurs.\nIn this model we have assumed the presence of a diffusive morphogen that trig-\ngers CAM response. In this simplified model we have combined the effects of both\nmorphogen and CAMs into one term, a, in order to facilitate mathematical analysis.\nOnce again, it is not possible to solve the model directly: however, it is possible to\nundertake a linear stability analysis of the system to find parameter regions in which\npatterns of cell aggregations may arise. The condition for spatial patterns in cell den-\nsity is\n(11)\u03c7n0(N \u2212 n0) > 1,\nwhere n0 is the initial (uniform) cell density.\nThe system can be solved numerically using the MATLAB solver pdepe. We as-\nsume that initially both PSM cells and CAM-triggering morphogen are distributed\nuniformly along the AP axis and that a small perturbation is made to the cell density\nat the anterior end of the PSM (in our simulations this corresponds to x = 0). Fig. 6\nshows the results of numerical simulation for a set of parameter values which satisfy\nEq. (10). From an initially homogeneous field we see the sequential development of a\nseries of peaks and troughs in cell density with equivalent patterns in CAM-triggering\nmorphogen concentration. The patterns arise on a timescale and with a wavelength that\nis dependent on the choice of parameters. In other words, each new somite forms at\na specific time interval after the last somite and with a defined length, which depends\nupon the model parameters.\n198 Baker et al.\nAn extension of this model needs to address a number of issues. Firstly, how can\nthe model be made consistent with the observations of genetic prepatterns along the\nAP axis and how can we incorporate the role of the segmentation clock? Secondly,\nmathematical analysis shows that the initial (unpatterned) field of cells is unstable\nto perturbation: should a disturbance arise in a region ahead of the somite pattern, a\nsecond patterning envelope would initiate from the point of disturbance. Due to the\ninherently stochastic nature of gene transcription and translation it is likely this will\noccur\u2014extension of the model to take account of this is the subject of current work.\nIt is also important to point out that the major drawback of this model is that it does\nnot take into account the intercellular mechanical forces involved in the process of\nsomite formation. As a consequence, it cannot account for the morphological changes\nobserved during somitogenesis.\nIII. Discussion\nWe began this article by outlining the processes involved in somite formation, from\ncreation of a genetic prepattern to the mechanisms involved in generating morpho-\nlogical somites. We described the patterns of oscillating gene expression which are\nreadouts of the segmentation clock and the traveling patterns of gene expression\nwhich control segmental determination. In the middle section we described a series\nof mathematical models which aim to capture various aspects of somite formation.\nThe mathematical formulation of the Cooke\u2013Zeeman\u2013Pourqui\u00e9 Clock and Wavefront\nmodel integrates simple readouts from the clock and gradient to describe the forma-\ntion of a genetic prepattern which seems to guide development of the physical somites.\nModels for the segmentation clock assume an underlying regulatory transcription net-\nwork, characterized by delays in transcription and translation, drives oscillations in\nmRNA and protein levels. Models for the FGF8 gradient assume similar types of neg-\native feedback (but without delay) to describe the formation of traveling gradients of\nRA and FGF8. Finally we postulated a model which, rather than characterizing the\nformation of a genetic prepattern, describes the formation of cellular aggregations\u2014\nthe physical somites.\nThe current challenge is to build on these models in order to drive forward knowl-\nedge in this area. Development of more sophisticated models for both clock and\ngradient will allow us to elucidate the crucial mechanisms underlying each system.\nThese models can be integrated back into a generalized \u201cClock and Wavefront\u201d frame-\nwork and used to make predictions and test hypotheses. Below we outline the key\nchallenges in each area.\nCurrent models for the segmentation clock generally consist of simple transcrip-\ntional oscillators with delay terms allowing the intermediate synthesis steps, such as\ntransport, elongation and splicing, to be encompassed by a single parameter. Such\nmodels are easily solved numerically and allow predictions on the period of the clock\n6. Models for Somite Formation 199\nto be made based on model parameters. However, there is now a wealth of infor-\nmation available regarding the different molecular players involved in regulation of\nthe segmentation clock (Dequ\u00e9ant et al., 2006): how they interact and what happens\nwhen embryos mutant for crucial components are generated. Larger scale models are\nrequired in order to integrate this new data into a concrete framework. This will en-\ntail developing a \u201cSystems Biology\u201d approach with the deployment of, for example,\nBoolean and network models, and multiscale simulation techniques (Schnell et al.,\n2007). Another important aspect of the segmentation clock that has not yet been fully\nexplored is the coupling between adjacent PSM cells that arises from signaling via\nthe Notch\u2013Delta pathway. A mean-field approach generally assumes equal coupling\nbetween all cells of a network, which is clearly not the case in the somitogenesis oscil-\nlator. Development of a theoretical approach for dealing with large systems of coupled\noscillators is clearly important here, and also in a wider biological context.\nModeling of the gradient which underlies the determination front has only recently\nbegun to acquire attention and models for this are still at an early stage. It seems highly\nprobable that the formation and maintenance of such gradients are tightly coupled to\nthe events surrounding axial elongation. It has recently been shown, in mouse, that the\nFGF8 signaling gradient is mirrored by a gradient in Wnt3a, and that in fact, Wnt3a\nacts upstream of FGF8 (Aulehla and Herrmann, 2004; Aulehla et al., 2003). Wnt3a has\nalso been shown to play a major role in controlling cell proliferation, axis elongation\nand oscillations of Axin2 in the PSM (Aulehla et al., 2003; Galli et al., 2004). This\nyields the exciting possibility that Wnt3a may provide an underlying link between the\nsegmentation clock, specification of positional information and body axis elongation\n(Aulehla and Herrmann, 2004; Dubrulle and Pourqui\u00e9, 2004a).\nThe final piece of the story is the transition from genetic prepattern to epithelial\nsomites. Most current models for somitogenesis are concerned with the formation of a\ngenetic prepattern along the AP axis and few have attempted to model the series of cell\nrearrangements and shape changes that accompany the transition from prepattern to\ncoherent somite. Probably this is linked to the enormity of the task: our understanding\nof the biological processes involved is far from complete\u2014numerous complex, inter-\nacting processes are taking place\u2014and theoretical tools have not yet been developed\nto answer some of the questions which need to be addressed. The cell\u2013CAM model\npresented here is a simple attempt to address this process. It neglects many of the\nsalient features of the epithelialization process and cannot yet replicate many experi-\nmental observations. However, it is a first step on the road to constructing a framework\nfor this complex process and development of the model is the subject of current work.\nGlazier et al. (in this volume) developed a computational model of the spatiotemporal\npattern of adhesive and repulsive forces at work during somite formation. Sherratt and\nco-workers are also interested in applying their theoretical studies of differential cell\nadhesion (Armstrong et al., 2006) to somite formation, using the genetic prepattern to\ndrive the process (Armstrong et al., 2007), whilst Schnell and Grima have proposed\na model in which chemotaxis, differential cell adhesion and minimization of tissue\nsurface tension drive the cell sculpting process (Grima and Schnell, 2007).\n200 Baker et al.\nIV. Perspective\nThe goal of multiscale modeling is to investigate events happening on the microscopic\nscale and integrate results into models on a macroscopic level (Schnell et al., 2007).\nAlthough most models for somite formation are still firmly based on events taking\nplace at the macroscopic level, the wealth of new experimental data becoming avail-\nable and the generation of new experimental techniques is beginning to allow the\ngeneration of microscale models, thereby paving the way for truly multiscale models\nin the future.\nThe future of interdisciplinary research in developmental biology lies in the atti-\ntudes of both theoretical and experimental communities. Commitment to communi-\ncation across the boundaries of increasingly specialist research areas, alongside the\ndevelopment of tools and methods to facilitate the achievement of common goals, is\ncrucial. Mathematical modeling should be used as a tool to drive and expand knowl-\nedge. It has the power to integrate multiple hypotheses and ideas into a rigorous\nframework in which they can be submitted to analysis and in silico experiments, used\nto elucidate pertinent questions and devise future experiments. In turn, results from\nthese experiments can be applied to adjust and refine models. This feedback loop\nof modeling, testing and fine-tuning is essential for the development of biologically-\naccurate models and the acceleration of our understanding in the biomedical sciences.\nAcknowledgments\nR.E.B. thanks Research Councils UK for an RCUK Fellowship in Mathematical Biology, Lloyds Tercente-\nnary Foundation for a Lloyds Tercentenary Foundation Fellowship, Microsoft for a European Postdoctoral\nResearch Fellowship, St. Hugh\u2019s College, Oxford for a Junior Research Fellowship and the Australian\nGovernment, Department for Science, Education and Training for an Endeavor Postdoctoral Research Fel-\nlowship to visit the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Melbourne.
