Until now, his only other known astronomical treatise \nwas the groundbreaking Alae seu scalae mathematicae (1573), which historians have \nwrongly assumed was occasioned by his observations of the so-called new star of  \nNovember 1572. This article presents compelling evidence that another publication of \n1573, a neglected and anonymous Letter sent by a gentleman of England was, in fact, \nwritten by Digges. We argue that it contains Digges\u2019 very early observations of and \nopinions on the new star, and the first unambiguous support by an English writer for the \nEarth\u2019s annual motion. Of more than antiquarian interest, the discovery adds to our \nunderstanding of the development of Digges\u2019 radical views on the star, Copernicanism, \nheavenly motion and the infinity of the universe. \n \n \n1. Introduction: A Letter sent by a Gentleman of England. \n \nOn November 17th 15721 the puritan gentleman and leading English mathematician Thomas \nDigges observed a strange new light in the night sky in the constellation of Cassiopeia. He was \nnot quite the first: the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe saw it on November 11th. As November \npassed, it became extremely bright, reportedly outshining Venus: at its peak, with people seeing it \nin daylight. After a few months it began to fade, and had apparently disappeared to the naked eye \nby February 1574. Recently, Tycho\u2019s data has been used to rediscover the remnant of what is now \ncalled \u2018Tycho\u2019s supernova\u2019 but, since Digges\u2019s observations turn out to be the most accurate, we \nmight also speak of \u2018Digges\u2019s supernova\u2019.2 \n \nOf course, Digges and his contemporaries had no concept of supernovae. For them, the \n\u2018phenomenon\u2019 (the non-committal term often used by baffled observers) was a puzzling anomaly. \nIt attracted the attention, observations and opinions of countless astronomers and astrologers, as \nwell as natural philosophers, theologians and politicians, and provoked scores of printed and \nmanuscript works in the following months.3 It immediately precipitated a debate throughout \nEurope about its location, cause and significance. Most commentators assumed that it was a \ncomet, albeit a prodigious one given that it had neither an obvious tail nor any proper motion \nthrough the sky. A typical response was La d\u00e9claration d'un com\u00e8te ou estoille prodigieuse, \npublished in Paris in 1573 by a Frenchman revealing himself only as I.G.D.V.. \n \nDigges rejected the cometary hypothesis because he was one of a handful of participants in the \ndebate who were sufficiently skilled in new techniques of astronomical observation to be sure that \nthe body exhibited no or negligible diurnal parallax.4 Since the Moon exhibits a diurnal parallax \nof approximately 1 degree, any value of parallax smaller than that placed the phenomenon above \nthe terrestrial world. This meant that it had to be above the Moon and in the Aristotelians\u2019 \nunchanging superlunary world. Thus, with others, Digges successfully displaced the popular \nexplanation that it was a comet with the extraordinary explanation that it was a star. The \nStephen Pumfrey and David Riley England\u2019s First Copernican p. 2  \nobservations and deductions secured the international (and historical) reputations of both Brahe \nand Digges. Until recently, historians have assumed that Digges\u2019 Alae seu scalae mathematicae \n[\u2018Mathematical wings or ladders\u2019], an advanced treatise on parallax and its astronomical uses \npublished in London in 1573, was work occasioned by the new star. \n \nThis view must now be revised, for two reasons. The first is our claim, developed in this article, to \nhave discovered a hitherto overlooked tract by Digges specifically on the new star. This is the \nshort, anonymous pamphlet, also of 1573, called A Letter sent by a Gentleman of England, to his \nfrende, contayning a confutacion of a French mans errors, in the report of the myraculous starre \nnowe shyning. Its significance is three-fold. First, it adds to the small corpus of texts by Thomas \nDigges. Secondly, it sheds new light on Digges\u2019 work on the star. Finally, it contains the earliest \nsupport in a printed English work for the Copernican motion of the earth. We will return to this \nwork, hereafter the Letter, shortly. \n \nThe second reason is related. If we were right that the Letter contains Digges\u2019 opinions on the star \nthen what, we wondered, was the relation between the Letter and the Alae, which says \nsurprisingly little about the star itself?  As we wondered, Robert Goulding\u2019s illuminating answer \nwas published, which proved our suspicions in detail: the spherical geometry of the Alae (and, \nindeed, a companion treatise by John Dee) was developed before November 1572, as part of a \nmuch more ambitious and general cosmological project.5 To put the Letter in context, and to \nappreciate the circumstantial evidence for Digges\u2019 authorship, we must first consider the Alae. \n \n2. The Alae and the new star. \n \nThe full title of the Alae spells out the bigger project: it offered Mathematical Wings or Ladders, \nwith which to ascend to the furthest Theatres of the Heavens and, with a new and unheard-of \nMethod, to explore the paths of all the Planets, and then [only then] to find out the Distance, \nPosition and immense Magnitude of that portentous Heavenly Body shining with remarkable \nbrightness in the Northern part of the World. The wings were the advanced spherical geometry \ndeveloped in the Alae, and the superior observations made possible by better instruments. Digges \nconceded that any planetary parallaxes were so small that they could \u2018scarcely be perceived\u2019: he \nbelieved they were detectable because he accepted the conventional, low estimates of planetary \ndistances, as did Brahe. Indeed there is some evidence that he may have been influenced by a \nmodel of the universe which, from the earth to the fixed stars, was considerably smaller than even \nthe then accepted figures, thus making the parallax still easier to detect. If we take the figures for \ndistances often used in Digges\u2019 time, deriving from al-Fargh\u0101n\u012b, the distance from the earth to the \nstars is 65,357,500 miles.6 However, in his father Leonard Digges\u2019 Prognostication Everlastinge \nof Right Good Effect the distance from the earth to the stars can be computed as merely 358,463 \nmiles \u2013 and a half. It is to this text, in 1576, that Thomas famously appended his Copernican \ntreatise A Perfit Description of the Caelestiall Orbes, though he did not alter his father\u2019s figures \nfor the distances computed for the Ptolemaic model of the universe.7 Considering Thomas\u2019 \nengagement with the work of Regiomontanus, discussed below, he surely did not accept his \nfather\u2019s curiously low estimates, but he might have been sufficiently influenced to hope \nconfidently to measure planetary parallax. \n \nWhat fascinated Digges about parallax, as it later fascinated Tycho,8 was that Copernicanism \nrequired greater variations than did geocentrism in the distance from Earth of the planets, notably \nof Mars, and thus predicted different parallaxes. For Digges, this lack of observational \nequivalence meant that his method promised to bring to the dispute \u2018not merely probable \narguments but perhaps the surest demonstrations.\u20199 \n \nStephen Pumfrey and David Riley England\u2019s First Copernican p. 3  \nAs Goulding shows in detail, Digges\u2019 Alae (as, more sketchily, was Dee\u2019s Parallacticae \nCommentationis Praxeosque Nucleus quidam) was a sophisticated attempt to develop the \nmathematical analysis of observations of diurnal parallax beyond the level reached by \nRegiomontanus (1436-76) in a manuscript first published in 1531.10 Digges believed on good \ngrounds that more accurate observations, made possible by larger, graduated instruments, such as \nthe ten-foot cross staff devised by Richard Chancellor and used by Dee and himself, had given \nparallax methods the potential to prove Copernicus right. \n \nDigges\u2019 development had taken the approach of Regiomontanus beyond the German\u2019s original \naim, which had been to locate and classify problematic lights in the sky. A century before the \n1572 phenomenon, Regiomontanus had developed the geometry of parallax to determine whether \nthe comet of 1471 was superlunary; he concluded, conservatively, that it was not. Claims that \nsome comets had superlunary paths became a little more frequent during the sixteenth century, \nand in 1556 Johann Hebenstreit even suggested that two comet-like phenomena seen in that year \nwere the same, celestial object.11 \n \nThus, although Digges\u2019 grand project was developed before 1572, and the new \u2018phenomenon\u2019, \nwas tangential to it, it was obviously tractable by the methods of the Alae even if the answer (that \nthere was no discernible parallax) was, by the terms of that project, a null result. We agree with \nGoulding that passages in the Alae referring to the star were late incorporations, which do not, in \nfact, suggest a very thorough investigation. The main loci occur en passant in the Alae\u2019s front \nmatter, comprising an illustration, a table, dedication, preface and proemium. There follow 21 \nproblemata, and nine practical capitula concerning proper use of the astronomical radius, which \nwere developed before the star appeared. An additional tenth capitulum (followed immediately by \na Conclusion) contains Digges\u2019 only specific, and brief, references to his observations. Indeed, as \nTycho noted critically, and as Goulding emphasises, the Alae \u2018provided no numerical examples \nbased on actual observation of the New Star.\u201912 Goulding doubts that he had any to include, for he \nhad established the absence of parallax using a simple rule of the staff. Digges wrote simply: \n \n\u2018By this means, on many nights, I noted that this miraculous Phenomenon appears \nin a straight line with the little star in the knee of Cassiopeia and the other star \nbeneath the belt of Cepheus on the right-hand side.\u201913 \n \nIndeed, Digges went on to point out that anyone could \u2018see\u2019 that the phenomenon was \nsuperlunary \u2018using sight alone, without any instrument\u2019. A simple check on its position \nwith respect to the neighbouring star \u2018in sedis pede\u2019 showed that any parallax must be less \nthan 30 minutes.14 \n \nThis does not mean that the new star did not give Digges and Dee the occasion to publish their \nworks on parallax, for in November 1572 parallax clearly changed from a recondite astronomical \nproblem into a key question for philosophers, theologians and politicians. Some of the new \ngeneration of post-Copernican astronomers, like Digges, Hayek and Brahe were especially open \nto new cosmological thinking, and their new hypotheses raised new religio-political questions. \nOne suggestion was that it was an extraordinary comet of earthy origin that marvellously had \ncrossed the lunar boundary and produced an alteration in the heavens; Dee suggested that it was a \nstar that had approached the Earth and was now receding through planetary regions (which could \nnot, therefore, be filled with solid spheres). Digges and Dee inclined favourably to the view that it \nwas the first new star since the birth of Christ foretelling, perhaps, His second coming. The \nimplications of such interpretations elevated parallax, and expertise in it, into key resources, and \nwe might conclude that Digges and Dee seized the opportunity to publish their pre-existing work. \n \nStephen Pumfrey and David Riley England\u2019s First Copernican p. 4  \nWhether the phenomenon was an extraordinary comet or a new star, rulers were troubled that it \npresaged some remarkable event in the sacred history of the world. Tycho reported to his lord, \nFrederick II of Denmark. It is worth noting here that the author of La d\u00e9claration d'un com\u00e8te ou \nestoille prodigieuse has been identified as Jean Gosselin de Vire (1510-1604), who held the \nposition of royal librarian to Henri III, and who probably performed a similar service for his \nlord.15 Likewise, less than month after he first observed the phenomenon, Digges was consulted \nby his patron William Cecil, Baron Burghley and Elizabeth I\u2019s Lord Treasurer. \n \nDigges wrote up his observations and advice in a letter to Burghley of December 11th, 1572. It \nshows that Digges was considering the possibility that the phenomenon was a star and not a \ncomet, but that he was not sure about either its nature or its astrological significance. Digges \nadvised Cecil that he had \u2018waded as far as ancient grounds of astrology and authors\u2019 precepts of \napproved credit will bear me, to sift out the unknown influence of this new star or comet.\u2019 Thus, a \nmonth after the star\u2019s appearance, Digges had not acquired his later confidence that the object had \nlittle or no parallax. The uncertainty, and pull of the traditional meteorological explanation, is \nfurther reflected in the fact that Burghley or his clerk wrote on the outside of the document, for \nfiling purposes no doubt, \u2018comet\u2019.16 \n \nThe phenomenon clearly created opportunities for mathematical clients to present their patrons \nwith very technical work, which nevertheless had great utility. Digges did so as part of his \nattempts in the 1570s to promote himself as an exponent of more philosophical, \u2018Platonic\u2019 \ncosmology as well as practical mathematics. He was already well known and valued as the \ndeveloper of his father Leonard\u2019s advanced, humanist style of practical mathematics. But, in his \nfirst publication in 1571, a completion of his father\u2019s Pantometria, he appended his own \nMathematicall Discourse of Geometricall Solids. Johnston\u2019s recent biography describes this as \n\u2018the most self-consciously advanced and novel work on geometry published in sixteenth-century \nEngland.\u201917 \n \nSimultaneously, Digges was seeking to transform the epistemological status of astronomy from a \nprimarily predictive discipline to one that helped to determine cosmological realities, a \ntransformation urged by Copernicus and secured by Galileo. This is manifest not merely in the \naims but also in the rhetoric of the Alae, which is full of Platonic allusions to mathematics as a \nsource of \u2018Sophia Coelestis\u2019, a phrase that expresses Digges\u2019 Copernican view that mathematics \nwas integral to natural philosophy. Indeed, the opening sections of Digges\u2019 letter to the reader of \nthe Alae mentions approvingly, indeed twice, Plato\u2019s maxim that \u2018Astronomia causa oculos \nhominibus esse datos\u2019 [\u2018Astronomy is the reason why men were given eyes.\u2019]18 The alae \nthemselves are an allusion to Plato, although probably filtered through Melanchthon, a favourite \nauthor for Digges the devout Protestant.19 In Phaedrus, Plato had written of winged versus base \nand wingless souls. Melanchthon commented: \n \nthose souls from which the wings [alae] have departed wander on the ground and seek \nimpure pleasures from terrestrial things; for they do not see the most beautiful light of \ncelestial things. Although Plato interpreted the wings as the heroic impulses of the mind, \nthese impulses alone do not bear the mind upwards: indeed skills are necessary to sustain \nthose impulses. Arithmetic and geometry are, therefore, the wings of the human mind.... \nRaised to heaven by their might, you will be able to illuminate with your eyes the natural \nuniverse of things, to perceive the distances and measurements of the greatest bodies, to \nsee the fateful conjunctions of the stars, in short to perceive the causes of the greatest \nthings which happen in this human existence.20 \n \nStephen Pumfrey and David Riley England\u2019s First Copernican p. 5  \nIn Capitulum X, the Alae\u2019s apparent addition on the new star, Digges declared a deep frustration \nthat in 1573 mundane concerns were frustrating his lofty goals. The star demanded new \ninstruments, observations and other work and, fearing that the star might not shine for much \nlonger, he wanted urgently to provide them: \n \nif the short period of time and my other concerns allow. But currently I am forcibly \ndragged away and diverted from these celestial contemplations by several lower human \naffairs. I should have considered my good fortune during that time and forced myself to \ncomplete the book without alteration, and to draw up the tables by hand. ...However, once \nthe obstacles of fortune and mundane matters have been sorted out and overcome, I will \n(with God\u2019s favour) return to my most pleasant mathematical sources. 21 \n \nOne reading of the Alae, then, is that Digges hoped it would lead to time and support for his \n\u2018Platonic\u2019 astronomical work. Studies of new physical astronomers from Tycho to Galileo show \nhow important was courtly patronage to their innovative, expensive, time-consuming and \ncontroversial work. For an innovative text like the Alae, that would raise for an international \nLatinate audience the distinct possibility that Copernicus was right, Digges needed the legitimacy \nprovided by a letter of dedication to his patron. Digges opened his letter to Burghley \n(conventionally) by saying that he had been looking for a way to show his gratitude. \u2018Then a \nsuitable occasion happened when (at your command) I attempted to measure the place, size, \ndistance and magnitude of the shining new star, or very rare phenomenon.\u201922 The letter then \nmoves via Digges\u2019 attempt to measure its parallax (and his astonishment that it had none), to the \nmore general cosmological significance of improving upon Regiomontanus. Having enrolled \nBurghley\u2019s protection of his \u2018first ventures into astronomy\u2019, he concluded with his hope that the \nquestion of whether or not the \u2018inharmonious (not to say monstrous)\u2019 world system of antiquity \n\u2019has been sufficiently corrected and fully reformed by Copernicus, that divine and altogether more \nthan human genius\u2019. \n \nIn the event, Burghley appears to have been unwilling to promote this aspect of Digges\u2019 research. \nDigges offered him a further astronomical treatise in 157423, an approach that brought no fruit. \nThe [vernacular] Perfit Description of 1576 was Digges\u2019 last published contribution to the new \nastronomy and, although he continued to express interest in cosmology, he moved to the \npatronage of the Earl of Leicester and to publications in practical, especially military \nmathematics. A lack of English interest in his Alae surely played into his recollection, in the \nPreface to the Stratioticos of 1579, dedicated to Leicester, that he had \n  \nspent my younger years, even from my cradle, in the sciences liberal, and especially in \nsearching the most difficult and curious demonstrations mathematical\u2026 yet finding none, \nor very few, with whom to confer and communicate those my delights, (and remembering \nalso that grave sentence of the divine Plato, that we are not born for ourselves, but also for \nour parents, country, and friends), after I grew to years of riper judgement, I have wholly \nbent myself to reduce those imaginative contemplations to sensible practical conclusions \nof those my delectable studies, as also to be able, when time is, to employ them to the \nservice of my prince and country.24 \n \nIf the Alae\u2019s dedication to Burghley emphasised its relevance to the star, Digges nine-page letter \nto his international readership focussed on the larger cosmological questions. To be sure, over sig. \nA1v and sig. A2r he included a brief excursus on the star. This simply states that skilled \nmathematicians consider it a star high in the heavens, and asserts, on Aristotle\u2019s authority, that \ncomets do not belong in this region of \u2018the purest Aether, where there can be no naturally \noccurring changes, novelties or alterations\u2019. Digges\u2019 position was that those who say it is a comet \nStephen Pumfrey and David Riley England\u2019s First Copernican p. 6  \n\u2018either condemn or devalue this rarest sign, God\u2019s true miracle or messenger.\u2019 Beyond this, he \nwas: \n \ndetermined not to write anything more on the history of this star, because that \nextraordinary man John Dee (most learned in these studies and a prodigy in the rest of \nphilosophy, whom I esteem as my second Mathematical Father\u2026) has taken on the task of \nexpounding this material\u2026 [and] I have no doubt that it will soon be published.25 \n \nIn this matter, as in others, confidence that Dee would bring his work to the press was misplaced. \nDigges was probably thinking of the theory that Dee discussed with Christoph Rothmann, and \nwhich we can also infer from Dee\u2019s own reference to an unpublished Latin work of 1573 \u2018On the \nmarvellous star in Cassiopeia, sent down from heaven all the way to the orb of Venus, and then \ndrawn up again perpendicularly into the depths of the heavens sixteen months after its first \nappearance.\u201926 \n \nFortunately, positioned very incongruously at the front of the Alae, between the title page and \nBurghley\u2019s coat of arms and without comment, Digges placed a table of the exact positions of the \nthirteen stars in Cassiopeia, which he described as those recorded by Copernicus, after correcting \ntypographical errors in De Revolutionibus. We know that he did indeed make these corrections: \nthey form some of the very few marginalia recorded by Gingerich in Digges\u2019 copy.27 As well as a \nfine diagrammatic representation locating the star near the base of Cassiopeia\u2019s seat, Digges \nincluded a table of the distances from some of them of what he called a \u2018Mirandum Phenomenon\u2019 \nwhich, he thought, might \u2018recede before its orbit is dissolved by order of the Most Powerful\u201928 \n \nIt is not surprising that modern readers, who may not have read much beyond the title and this \ndouble spread, assume that the Alae is about the star. Yet nowhere in the Alae does Digges refer \nto these pages, nor does he discuss how he arrived at his revised positions for the thirteen normal \nand the one extraordinary star. Nor, until now, have historians suspected that he discussed the \nmatter anywhere else. He had, it seemed, in deference to Dee, \u2018determined not to write anything \nmore\u2019. \n \n3. The Letter, the new star, and Digges\u2019 authorship. \n \nWe believe that we have discovered something more. The discovery was serendipitous. In \nOctober 2004 Pumfrey began to inspect the \u2018front matter\u2019 or prefatory pages of the hundreds of \nworks published in England between 1570 and 1625 whose content could loosely be called \nscientific. This was research for a major AHRC-funded research project, based at Lancaster \nUniversity, on \u2018Science and Patronage in England, 1570-1625\u2019. \n \nProceeding alphabetically by author, he soon encountered the short pamphlet  listed under \n\u2018Anon[ymous]\u2019 in the Short Title Catalogue (STC), A Letter sent by a Gentleman of England, to \nhis frende, contayning a confutacion of a French mans errors, in the report of the myraculous \nstarre nowe shyning. It was printed in London by Thomas Marsh in 1573, and bears the STC \nnumber 155253-1797. A bibliographical search indicates that the only extant copy of the \npamphlet is to be found in the library at Lambeth Palace, London, where it is bound with a  \nmiscellaneous collection of pamphlets on diverse subjects. Unfortunately there is no provenance \nhistory for this volume and it does not appear to be in its original binding.29 The book seems to \nhave been completely ignored by historians perhaps because, from the title alone, it seems to be a \npiece of third-rate astrology. \n \nStephen Pumfrey and David Riley England\u2019s First Copernican p. 7  \nIf, however, one is familiar with the diagram of Cassiopeia in Digges\u2019 Alae, then the cruder but \nalmost identical diagram on the title page of the Letter immediately raises strong suspicions of \nDigges\u2019 authorship.30 (The diagrams are reproduced at the end of this article.) Who else in \nEngland was capable of producing such a diagram? There are other candidates, notably John Dee, \nand Digges might have offered his diagram to, or had it copied by, a third party. The uncanny \nsimilarity of the diagrams is perhaps insufficient evidence, but there is plenty of corroboration. \n \nBesides the title page with the depiction of Cassiopeia, the Letter consists of nine pages of text, \nunpaginated after the first page A.iii,31 and a final page declaring Marsh as the printer. It begins: \n\u2018Misopseudolugos Philomathei, salutem\u2019. Misopseudolugos is presumably a typographical error \nfor \u2018Misopseudologos\u2019, or a hater of false or lying doctrine. The liar or pseudologos alludes to the \noriginal Greek text of 1 Timothy 4:2 where, significantly perhaps, Timothy predicts that \u2018in the \nlatter times some shall depart from the faith\u2026 speaking lies in hypocrisy\u2019.32 Claims that an \nextraordinary celestial phenomenon was a sign of the Last Days were not unusual, but both the \nclaim for the star\u2019s significance, and the typically Protestant concern with eschatology, are at least \nconsistent with what we know about Digges\u2019 theological interests.33 \n \nThe conceit that legitimised publication was that Philomathes34, i.e. a lover of mathematics, had \nrequired \u2018my opynion touching the French Pamflet of a blasing starre latelye Englished.\u201935 \nHowever, Misopseudologos gives insufficient information easily to identify the original French \npamphlet: he nowhere names the author. We suggest that it may have been the very rare work, La \nd\u00e9claration d'un com\u00e8te ou estoille prodigieuse mentioned above, by I.G.D.V., alias Gosselin.36 \nFortunately, it is the nature of Misopseudologos\u2019 epistolary response, and not the original \npamphlet, that is of interest. \n \nThat the French original was also anon- or pseudo-nymous is further suggested by the Letter\u2019s \nreference to Apelles and the shoemaker. Apelles, of course, was the supreme Greek painter who \nhid in the shadows in order to gather public reaction, such as the shoemaker\u2019s, to his work.37 \nMisopseudologos\u2019 jibe is that the unmathematical author should have taken the ignorant \nshoemaker\u2019s role and \u2018content himself to loke on, and geve others leave to play the part on the \nMathematicall stage\u2019. One reason, therefore, for the Letter\u2019s anonymity might be that \nMisopseudologos-Digges was casting himself as an expert in the manner of Apelles. Indeed, one \ncomplaint of the Letter, again consistent with Digges\u2019 views on Elizabethan mathematicians like \nhimself, is: \n \n\u2018the ill opynion [the English translator] seemed to have of his owne countryemen, that \namonge the abundant choise of so many excellent Mathematicians, would rather publishe \nsuch a toye, than use thadvise of suche as mighte have taughte a veritye.\u201938 \n \nInterestingly Digges makes use of the story of Apelles elsewhere in a similar manner. When \ndiscussing navigation and navigators in the short sections he added on the subject to his father\u2019s \nPrognostication Everlasting in 1576, he suggests navigators should leave it to mathematical \nexperts to discern the difficult questions of navigation; \u2018let them learn Apelles\u2019s lesson Ne Sutor \nUltra Crepidam.\u201939 \n \nAt this point, a brief summary of the Letter\u2019s main arguments is in order. It alerts readers to the \n\u2018manye errors and that of all sorts, Geometricall, Astronomicall, Physical, Cosmographical and \nHistorical\u2019 made by the French author, but above all that the star was a comet. It criticises in \ndetail the author\u2019s poor knowledge of spherical geometry, his inaccurate depiction of the stars in \nCassiopeia and, in particular, his location of the new star within the constellation. But his cardinal \nmistake was \u2018to discover a Parallaxe\u2019 where there was none, indeed a parallax that contravened \nStephen Pumfrey and David Riley England\u2019s First Copernican p. 8  \nbasic geometrical principles.40 Moreover, the author contradicts himself because his own value for \nparallax puts the body above the Moon, so such basic mathematical errors mean that one can \nignore the author\u2019s gloomy prognostications, although the Letter accepts (as did the Alae) that the \nbody is \u2018a forewarning of God\u2019s inscrutable pleasure\u2019. All social ranks had \u2018greate cause to stand \nin horrour of this myraculous signe, as a forerunner of Gods just Judgemente\u2019.41 \n \nThat the Frenchman had inadvertently put his comet above the moon allowed Misopseudologos to \nremind him of basic Aristotelian meteorology: \u2018unlesse he will make warre with Naturall \nPhilosophers and explode Aristotle, he cannot terme hym a Comet.\u201942 Once again, this is \nconsistent with Digges opinion in the Alae where, as Goulding notes, Digges rejected \u2018the \npossibility that the star could be composed of cometary matter somehow carried up into the \ncelestial realm: Aristotle had shown that terrestrial matter could never stray outside its own, \nsublunar sphere.\u201943 This combination of a radical astronomy with a conservative sublunary \nphilosophy would also figure in Digges\u2019 Perfit Description, where he depicted the Earth in solar \norbit but as part of a sublunary and elemental \u2018great orbe carrying this globe of mortalitye\u2019.44 \n \nAs we move to more positive evidence, we should recall that the Letter was printed by Thomas \nMarsh, Digges\u2019 regular publisher at the time. Marsh had been a prolific printer of innovative \nastronomical and astrological works since a Right Excellent Treatise of Astronomy with a \nPrognostication of 1554-5, going on in 1556 to print John Field\u2019s Reinholdian Ephemeris, the \nfirst English book to mention Copernicus\u2019 theory.45 Digges probably used Marsh because of his \nreputation, and entrusted him not only with the Alae (and Letter) in 1573, but also with his \nfamous Copernican tract, the Perfit Description of the Celestiall Orbes, appended to his 1576 \nedition of the Prognostication Everlasting. Marsh continued to print Digges\u2019 1578, 1584 and \n1585 editions. \n \nMore evidence comes from the Letter\u2019s praise for the Zodiacus Vitae, by Marcellus Palingenius \nStellatus (usually taken as the pseudonym of Pier Angelo Manzolli).46 The Letter notes that, while \nthe Frenchman has obviously not studied \u2018Ptolemey, Copernicus or other Mathematicianes, yet of \nPoetes as Palingenius he might have learned howe Cassiopea decem atq tribus stat lucida \nflammis.\u2019 Digges was a great admirer of Palingenius; he learned Book XI of Zodiacus Vitae \u2018bie \nhart\u2019 and took \u2018much delight to repeat it often\u2019, not least because it was one inspiration for his \nbelief that the stars were at different distances from the Earth.47 In The Perfit Description he \nquoted some twenty lines in support of his infinite, Copernican cosmology.48 Published in Basle \nin 1543 and banned for its heterodox rationalism in the first Index Librorum Prohibitorum of \n1559, the \u2018Stellifyed\u2019 and \u2018Christian\u2019 poet\u2019s Zodiacus Vitae rapidly became popular among \nEnglish Protestants. Volumes of Googe\u2019s English translation began to appear in 1560, and \nEngland\u2019s first Latin edition was printed in 1569 - by none other than Digges\u2019 printer Thomas \nMarsh.49 \n \nA very strong clue is contained in the Letter\u2019s closing advice. Despite the French author\u2019s shoddy \nwork, Misopseudologos urged Philomathes to \u2018proceede in the passinge, pleasaunte studyes of the \nnoble sciences Mathematical fit onely for fre[e] and noble minds that stoup not at filthy lucre\u2019.50 \nAt a time when Digges was self-fashioning an image as a gentlemanly, humanist (even \n\u2018Platonist\u2019) scholar, he distanced himself from the growing number of commercial mathematical \nwriters and practitioners for whom mathematics was a livelihood. On the title page of Alae Digges \nstyled himself \u2018Stemmatis Generosi\u2019 (from a well bred genealogy), reproducing his own family\u2019s \ncoat of arms as well as Burghley\u2019s. It is, then, significant that, in his dedication to Burghley he \ncontrasts his imagined mathematical critics with those whose minds are most noble and dignified \nand \u2018quae nihil vile sapiant lucrum\u2019 (who are not acquainted with base lucre).51 Again, in the \nPantometria of 1571 he had presented himself as a mathematician in the mould of  Euclid and \nStephen Pumfrey and David Riley England\u2019s First Copernican p. 9  \nArchimedes, and not one of \u2018those [practitioners] given only to lucre\u2019.52 We are not aware of any \nElizabethan mathematician other than Digges who deployed this specific trope. \n \nThe strongest evidence, however, comes from similarities in the treatment of the new star between \nthe Letter and the treatment that Digges provided in his Alae. Like other observers such as Tycho \nand Hajek, Digges brought a new exactitude to the constellation of Cassiopeia. His desire to \nlocate exactly the new star made the positions of Cassiopeia\u2019s customary thirteen stars crucial. We \nsaw how the Alae began with a table of unprecedented accuracy of those stars\u2019 longitudes, \nlatitudes and magnitudes, compiled from Digges\u2019 own corrections of De Revolutionibus.53 \n\u2018Misopseudologos\u2019 took the same great care to map precisely the positions of the key stars in \nCassiopeia. For him, the Frenchman\u2019s errors were that \u2018[f]irst in the portrayture of Cassiopeia the \nvery starres are mistaken, and the new star misplaced.\u201954 Thus, as in the Alae, Digges carefully \nestablishes from Copernicus the longitudes of the two nearest stars, in sedis pede and in coxa \n(now called kappa Cassiopeaie and gamma Cassiopeaie), as 8 degrees 20 minutes and 10 degrees \nexactly. The new star being in between these values, the Letter finds it easy to conjecture \u2018by \nsighte without Instrumente within one degree\u2019 that \u2018nyne grades therefore [is] the longitude of this \nnew starre in the eyghte sphere by sighte onely collected, as I have before declared.\u201955 Digges \nproceeded to show off his expertise in technical Copernican astronomy by calculating the star\u2019s \nposition with respect to the ecliptic. This provided Digges with the opportunity to show that he \nhad updated Copernicus\u2019 value for the precession of the equinoxes to \u201827. grades 49 minuts, \nwhich I have by certaine Calculation found to be Praecessio Aequinoctio vera, for the Nativitye \nof oure Saviour last past\u2019, i.e. 25th December, 1572. The adjustment \u2018produceth 6. grades 49 \nminutes in Taurus for [the new star\u2019s] longitude of place\u2019.56 \n \nThis exactitude is, of course, a prelude to refuting the Frenchman\u2019s main error, that the prodigious \nstar exhibited sufficient parallax to be a \u2018blasing starre\u2019 or comet. The Frenchman \u2018giveth his new \nstarre severall distances from Alrucuba [sic] at his greatest heighte, (which in deede is nothinge \nso)\u2019.57  The question of any parallax for the star still being open perhaps explains why Digges \nsaved his greatest scorn for the Frenchman\u2019s claim that the new star\u2019s \u2018greatest Parallaxe [was] \nabove the Pole, and his lesser underneath, which is a matter so absurde, as our Mathematicall \ninfants will laughe to scorne\u2019. In any case, the small parallax the Frenchman claimed to observe \nwould \u2019give [the body] to be above the Moone\u2019. 58 \n \nThe Letter becomes less interesting in the second half, in which Digges disputes the Frenchman\u2019s \nprognostication of the phenomenon\u2019s likely effects. It is worth noting that Digges accepted that \ncomets were portents, although he refuted the Frenchman\u2019s claim that they always signified \n\u2018horrible effects\u2019. However, he insisted that \u2018unfitly are the significations of Comets applied to \nstarres, or Phaenomena that are aboute the Region Elementare.\u201959 \n \nFinally, and in agreement with Digges view in the Alae that the star was a miraculous sign from \nGod, he readily agreed with the Frenchman\u2019s conclusion. It was \u2018not to be disliked for that it \ncontayneth both piety and veritie and no doubt it is as he sayth a forewarning of Gods inscrutable \npleasure, which wil fall out to be no less straung and myraculous in effect, then this signe wherby \nit is forewarned is rare and supernaturall.\u2019 And so Misopseudologos concluded with Digges\u2019s \nsignature trope: \n \nexhortinge you [Philomathis] to proceede in the passing pleasaunte studies of the noble \nsciences Mathematicall fit onely for fre[e] and noble mindes that stoupe not at filthy lucre \nI commit you to the protecting of the Almightye.60 \n \n4. Digges\u2019 Letter as England\u2019s first pro-Copernican text. \nStephen Pumfrey and David Riley England\u2019s First Copernican p. 10  \n \nConfident, then, that Digges wrote the anonymous letter, we can identify him as the author of the \nstatement contained in it that the Earth moves. To locate the new star in Copernican fashion, the \nLetter needed to allow for the precession of the equinoxes, in order to make \n \naccompte as Copernicus doth from the little starre in the horne of the Ramme, which in the \nolde Astronomers tyme stoode in the very intersection of the line Ecliptike and Equinoctial \n[i.e. at the Spring equinox], but sithens by the stealinge course of the starres fixed, or \nrather of the earthe as Copernicus with better reasons proveth, is removed since that time \n27. grades 49 minuts.61 \n \nOf course, Copernicus\u2019 explanation of precession, which came to be rejected along with his \ncommitment to solid spheres, involved the earth\u2019s annual motion in its sphere being almost, but \nnot quite, countered by an opposite \u2018third motion\u2019 of the Earth. This acted to keep the Earth\u2019s axis \npointing at the celestial pole, with the slight slippage generating the 26,000-year cycle of \nprecession. To accept that Copernicus had a better or proven explanation, was to accept that the \nEarth orbited the Sun, as we know Digges did. Of course, the statement is a mere aside to \ndiscussion of the new star. Furthermore, in Digges\u2019 era, the verb \u2018to prove\u2019 did not always mean \napodictic demonstration (the level of certainty Digges sought in the Alae). But the statement \nindicates the author\u2019s belief in Copernicus\u2019 annual motion of the Earth, and we believe that we \nhave shown that Digges was that author. \n \nIf we are right, then this would be the first statement in support of Copernicus heliocentric \ncosmology (as opposed to his astronomy) to be published by Digges and, therefore, by any \nEnglish writer. In making this claim we are not interested, as were some twentieth-century \nhistorians, in collecting early and heroic English adherents to \u2018the truth\u2019. Over-enthusiastic claims, \nand consequent misreadings once led to John Dee, John Feild and, even earlier, Robert Recorde, \nas early adopters of heliocentrism in England. More sophisticated history of astronomy has, in any \ncase, exposed the weakness of the evidence for these claims. \n \nWe are, however, interested in its value for re-assessing the development of Digges\u2019 astronomical \nthought, which is a central concern of the researches of one of us (Riley). Digges was most \ncertainly a Copernican. Less certain is when he committed himself in print to the Earth\u2019s annual \nmotion, and some reconsideration of this too is needed. He had not committed himself in the Alae: \nFor all the pro-Copernican rhetoric, Digges awaited an empirical determination from parallax \ndata. The same tension exists in the Perfit Description, by which time Digges\u2019 commitment to \nheliocentricity was even more obvious, but still not entirely explicit. \n \nIn the Perfit Description, Digges introduces his translation of, with occasional commentary upon, \nBook I of De Revolutionibus via a conceit. The conceit is that, while his father Leonard had \nemployed a Ptolemaic \u2018theorick or model\u2019 in his Prognostication, English readers expert in \nneither mathematics nor Latin should have the opportunity to judge Copernicus\u2019 theorick for \nthemselves. So he wanted \u2018to publish this, to the end such noble English minds (as delight to \nreach above the baser sort of men) might not be altogether defrauded of so noble a part of \nPhilosophy.\u2019 Its description as philosophy, of course, signifies Digges other \u2018end [that] it might \nmanifestly appear that Copernicus meant not as some have fondly accused him, to deliver these \ngrounds of the Earth's mobility only as Mathematical principles, feigned & not as Philosophical \ntruly averred.\u201962 \n \nAlthough Digges included phrases such as \u2018demonstrations mathematicall\u2019 or \u2018demonstratively \napproved\u2019 and, indeed \u2018perfit description\u2019, ultimately he left open the question of the physical \nStephen Pumfrey and David Riley England\u2019s First Copernican p. 11  \ntruth of heliocentrism. Thus, when discussing philosophical reasons for and against it, Digges \nwrites: \n \nfor my own part in this case I will only say: there is no doubt but of a true ground truer \neffects may be produced than of principles that are false, and of true principles falsehood \nor absurdity cannot be inferred. If, therefore, the Earth be situate immoveable in the Center \nof the world, why find we not Theorickes upon that ground to produce effects as true and \ncertain as these of Copernicus?63 \n \nDigges promised to reveal his own arguments at a later date, and in a striking rhetorical form: \n \nGod sparing life, I mean though not as a Judge to decide, yet at the mathematical bar in \nthis case to plead, in such sort as it shall manifestly appear to the World whether it be \npossible upon the Earth's stability to deliver any true or probable Theorick & then refer the \npronouncing of sentence to the grave Senate of indifferent discreet Mathematical \nReaders.64 \n \nObviously, Digges doubted that it was possible but, although God spared his life until 1595, he \nnever marshalled a printed refutation. What, then, might have been his argument? We suggest that \nit would have relied on the same parallax method for which Digges had great hopes in the Alae. \nThis reading leaves Digges\u2019 first clear commitment in print to the Earth\u2019s annual motion not in the \nPerfit Description of 1576 but in the Letter of 1573. \n \nThis raises our final questions concerning the Letter: when was it written and published, and was \nit published before or after the Alae? Both appeared in 1573, within a few months  of the star\u2019s \nappearance. We have no definitive answer at present, but we suggest that the Letter was first, and \nwe make some tentative inferences about the development of Digges\u2019 work on the star and \ncosmology. \n \n5. Dating the Letter and the Alae. \n \nThe Letter bears almost no evidence of dating beyond the \u2018Anno Domini. 1573\u2019 that appears on \nthe title page, although the reference to \u2018the Nativitye of oure Saviour last past\u2019 (presumably \nChristmas 1572) means that it was written by December 1573. The Alae, and Dee\u2019s companion \nNucleus, are more intriguing. Digges apparently worked at speed on the Alae until late February, \n1573 and dated his \u2018Praefatio Authoris\u2019 accordingly. What Goulding describes as a \u2018friendly \nrivalry\u2019 between Digges and Dee led to his \u2018mathematical father\u2019 hurriedly preparing his own \nwork for the press, and dating his prefatory letter March 5th, 1573, no more than 15 weeks after \nthe star\u2019s appearance.65 \n \nLike Goulding, we found it incredible that Digges and Dee could have developed their complex \nparallactic methods in only a few weeks, and we were ready to agree with his argument that both \nworks were substantially complete before November 1572. We find it preferable to another \nhypothesis we had considered, that the Alae actually appeared in 1574, not four but sixteen \nmonths after the star appeared. This is a possibility because of the different calendars in operation \nin Europe at the time. Calendar reform was a big issue in the sixteenth century.66 In many \ncountries the start of the year was moved back from 25th March, the Feast of the  Annunciation of \nChrist, to January 1st, the start of the old Roman civil year. By 1572 countries such as Denmark \nand France had made the change, but England delayed until 1752. In England the legal year-end \nof 24th March continued to apply in most situations, including letter writing.67 Digges\u2019 and Dee\u2019s \nletters, and the dates on their title pages could, therefore, refer to 1574 \u2018new style\u2019. \nStephen Pumfrey and David Riley England\u2019s First Copernican p. 12  \n \nThe crucial issue is whether the legal or calendar year was employed at the time by the Stationers\u2019 \nCompany that oversaw the printing of the works. Little research has been done, especially for the \nsixteenth century, and confusion remains, not least because the Stationers\u2019 Register used the old \nstyle legal year: even A.F. Pollard was misled. Edgerton has made the most thorough study. He \nconcluded that \u2018sixteenth-century printers customarily used the calendar year rather than the legal \nyear\u2019, except for specialised classes of works that included official and some learned literature \nsuch as law books.68 Our own checks on a few contemporary natural philosophical and \nmathematical works suggest that they too were dated new style.69 Thus new style dating was very \nprobably given to the Alae, Nucleus and Letter \u2013 although it is unfortunate that all entries for the \nyears 1572-5 are missing from the Register. \n \nIt would seem, then, that the Alae, and the Nucleus were indeed printed in spring 1573 new style: \nwe cannot infer the Alae appeared at the very end of the legal year 1573, and the Letter before \nChristmas and hence earlier. Moreover, by Christmas 1573, one year after the star\u2019s appearance, it \nwas obvious that it was fading. It would have been clear to Digges that the extensive fading of the \nstar was not an artefact of the annual revolution, which was one hypothesis that he had \nentertained.70 \n \nWe are left with internal evidence, which mostly points to the Letter as the earlier work. In the \nfirst place, Digges\u2019 positional astronomy seems cruder. It mentions only naked eye observations, \nmade without instruments and accurate only to the order of half a degree. As Digges explained in \nthe Alae, this was sufficient accuracy to refute claims that the phenomenon was sublunary, and the \nLetter was a polemical work, hoisting the bungling Frenchman with his own petards. \nNevertheless, the rhetorical argument depended upon Misopseudologos demonstrating his \nmathematical superiority, and it would have been odd had Digges suppressed the incomparably \nmore accurate positional data of the Alae. Secondly, the depiction of Cassiopeia and her new star \nis much more crudely drawn: indeed, the Letter generally gives the impression of a work even \nmore rushed than the Alae: witness the uncorrected presence of Misopseudolugos and Alrucuba. \n \nThirdly, the Letter confidently stated that the phenomenon was \u2018a new starre in the eyghte \nsphere\u201971 (that is, the traditional sphere of the fixed stars). However, the Alae considered Dee\u2019s \ningenious hypothesis that the star was among the planets and was increasing and decreasing in \nbrightness as it moved nearer or further from the earth. Combined with Palingenius\u2019 opinion that \nsome stars were too faint to be seen, Dee\u2019s hypothesis may have inspired Digges to the radical \nvision he would soon describe in the Perfit Description, of stars at different distances from the \nEarth in a stellar \u2018sphere\u2019 of infinite extension.72 It is possible, then, that Digges got his radical \ninspiration in the few weeks of 1573 that separated his urgent drafting of the Letter and the \ncompletion of the Alae. \n \nFourthly, in the Alae, Digges declared that he would not write again on the new star, and leave the \nfield open to Dee, which suggests that his Letter was already penned. His authorship would have \nbeen obvious to Dee, and hardly concealed by the pseudonym Misopseudologos. We have \npreferred to explain the Letter\u2019s anonymity with reference to the trope of Apelles that cast Digges \nfittingly in the role of expert mathematician. \n \nIt is possible that the Letter (like, perhaps, the English translation to which it responded) was \ninitially a manuscript with limited circulation. Even if it was completed before the Alae, Digges \nmay have chosen to print it subsequently as an effective, vernacular refutation of the enduring \ninterpretation that it was a comet. Indeed consideration of the Letter\u2019s status as a response to the \nFrench tract might suggest a later date. Whether or not that tract was Gosselin\u2019s of (presumably) \nStephen Pumfrey and David Riley England\u2019s First Copernican p. 13  \nearly 1573 or another written very late in 1572, several weeks must have elapsed for it to have \nbeen printed in France, to have reached England, to have been translated and circulated, and for \nDigges to have penned and had printed his response. If the Alae was printed soon after February \n1573, then the Letter could not have appeared much earlier. We can give no definitive answer, but \nwe are inclined to read the Letter as Digges\u2019 early response to the phenomenon based on the \ninitial observations he presented to Burghley late in 1572. \n \n6. Conclusion: the evolution of Digges\u2019 work on the star. \n \nWe suggest that the anonymous Letter sent by a Gentleman of England was written by Thomas \nDigges some time after his December 12th report for Burghley, and before the appearance of the \nAlae. It was most likely compiled some time between December 25th 1572 and February 1573, \nnew style. In December Digges had still not dismissed the cometary hypothesis, and was looking \nfor classical precedents. The Letter confirms the suspicion that he first came to locate it as a star \n\u2018in the eighth sphere\u2019 on the basis of simple, even naked eye observations. He was now sure it \nwas a miraculous creation and a portent from God. Digges himself dated the Alae\u2019s more detailed \nobservations and appended paragraphs concerning the star to February 1573. During this short \nperiod, during which Digges discussed publication with Dee, we suggest that he shifted his \nposition again, now entertaining the older man\u2019s idea that the star had moved from deep in the \nstellar sphere towards the earth. This meant that it might yet exhibit some position-fixing parallax, \nand Digges now yearned in vain to conduct a thorough programme of observations when leisure \npermitted. He still thought of it as a marvellous sign although, as the end of the world failed to \noccur, he may have moved towards the more naturalistic explanation afforded by Dee\u2019s \nhypothesis. Indeed, Digges added to the plausibility of that hypothesis with his 1576 assertion that \nstars existed at many distances from the Earth, some of them so distant as to be invisible, in a \nstationary sphere of infinite thickness. To our knowledge, Digges never explicitly concluded that \nthe \u2018new star\u2019 had naturally moved from and returned to a distant place and invisibility. But later \nCopernicans, notably Digges\u2019s contemporary in London William Gilbert, were to build on his \ncosmology and observations of the star to buttress radical claims that stars and comets had much \ngreater and much more freedom of motion in an infinite universe stripped of solid spheres.73 \n \nDigges was influential in England as its first campaigning Copernican, and its first astronomer \nwith an international reputation, which rested on the Alae. Yet, while the rhetoric of the Alae \npresented heliocentrism as a very interesting hypothesis open to a parallactic method of proof or \nrefutation, the Letter shows that Digges was persuaded of the Earth\u2019s annual motion even earlier \nthan historians have previously realised. If we may be allowed a closing value judgement, it is a \nshame that the fledgling cosmologist who, more than Thomas Harriot, might have been \u2018the \nEnglish Galileo\u2019, never found the time fully to extend his alae mathematicae. \n \nStephen Pumfrey and David Riley England\u2019s First Copernican p. 14  \n \nFigure 1. \n \n \n \nDiagram of the position  of the constellation of Cassiopeia, showing the position of the new star in \nher seat, from Thomas Digges, Alae seu scalae mathematicae (Thomas Marsh: London, 1573), \nsig.

Green, \u2018Astrometry of the 1572 Supernova (B Cassiopeiae)\u2019, Astronomische \nNachrichten (2004), 325, 689-701. The distance of the new star from \u03ba Cassiopeiae ranged from \nThaddeus Hajek\u2019s 1\u00b0 24\u2019 to Tycho Brahe\u2019s 1\u00b0 31\u2019.

Diurnal \nparallax, which is exhibited by heavenly bodies considerably closer, and irrespective of whether \nthe Earth or heavens rotate daily, had been understood since the time of Hipparchus, but \ntechniques were considerably advanced at this time, not least by Thomas Digges. \n5\n R.

In an \nelectronically published lecture Owen Gingerich has written: \n \n[Tycho] knew that in the Ptolemaic system, the epicycle of Mars always lay \nbeyond the sun, whereas in the Copernican arrangement, Mars at its closest was only half \nthat distance away. Because Tycho, like Copernicus and Ptolemy before him, accepted an \nerroneously small earth-sun distance (in fact, too small by a factor of 20), he believed that \nhe had a chance to triangulate the distance to Mars using as his baseline the difference in \nviewpoint between an evening and a morning observation, the so-called diurnal parallax. \nWe know today that this parallax is actually too tiny for naked-eye visibility, though if the \nsolar distance had been as small as he believed, he could just have managed to detect it.  \nTycho\u2019s quest for the parallax of Mars was a driving factor during the golden years \nat his Uraniborg observatory, in the 1580s. At first, when he found no parallax, he \nbelieved that the Copernican arrangement had to be rejected since Mars seemed even at it \nclosest approach to be farther than the sun. But he continued his assault on the problem \nStephen Pumfrey and David Riley England\u2019s First Copernican p. 17  \n                                                                                                                                                                                             \nand two years later discovered that he had to correct for differential refraction of the \nearth\u2019s atmosphere. As it subsequently worked out, his refraction table had an error \nexactly equal to the effect he was seeking, which led to a spurious result for the distance to \nMars. Believing that he had proved that Mars came closer than the sun, he then declared \nagainst the Ptolemaic arrangement. Interestingly, however, he did not endorse the \nCopernican system, but rather, he adopted his own geo-heliocentric scheme [which he \npublished in 1588]. \n \nSee Owen Gingerich, \u2018Truth and Persuasion in Science\u2019, Section 3, \u2018Proof and Persuasion\u2019:  \nhttp:\/\/www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk\/cis\/gingerich\/index.html.
