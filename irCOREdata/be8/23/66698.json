Scales \n \n \nYou know, there are things that people of your generation and mine ought never to \nforget. We've been through the war and we know perfectly well what the Germans are \nlike \u2026 and how national character basically doesn't change.2 \n \nStudents of the history of political ideas are wont to regard national stereotypes with some \ndisdain. Medievalists, despite \u2013 indeed, no doubt partly on account of \u2013 their current \ninfatuation with all aspects of the medieval 'nation', are in this respect no different. The fact \nthat stereotyped utterances about various European realms, regions, settlements, and their \npopulations are common in medieval writings has not, of course, gone unnoticed.3 On the \nwhole, however, their occurrence has not been found especially illuminating. Instead, it is \ntheir intellectual vacuity and dull predictability that tend to be stressed \u2013 when they are \nscrutinized at all.4 The instinctive distaste of most scholars for prejudice masquerading as \neternal truth often shows through, and there are specialists in the field who roundly insist that \ncataloguing mere 'topoi of differentiation' is no part of the proper business of the historian of \nidentities.5 Where collective stereotypes have attracted interest, it has been as potential \nevidence for the consolidation of the communities which applied them or became their \nsubjects. The early growth of the nation, some have thought, can in a rough-and-ready way be \ntraced by charting their proliferation.6 A major context for this has often been found in the \ngrowth of secular government during the later Middle Ages and in the emergence of a new \nsort and scale of warfare.7 A natural concomitant, it is argued, was the elaboration and \ndiffusion in the warring kingdoms of an unreflective, easy-to-use armoury of clich\u00e9s of self-\ncongratulation and of vilification for neighbours and enemies.8 No account of the cultural \nimpact of the Hundred Years War is now complete without a glance at the language of \nmutual insult which produced images of the proud, stiff-necked French and of drunken, \nloutish (and tailed) Englishmen abroad.9 War made nations, and thus it was soon nations, \ndecked out in a new, cheap and gaudy, rhetorical finery, that were making war. Stereotypes \nhad a central place in the parchment call-to-arms, clustering thickest around those peoples \n \n \n1\nwhich, in an age of organized violence, went to war most often, most ruthlessly, and to most \ndevastating effect. \n Not only common sense but also the relationship between war and stereotype familiar \nfrom the more recent past seems to support this view: the conspicuously aggressive become \nnature's aggressors.10 But whatever stimulates the proliferation of stereotypes in the first \nplace, there is another aspect to their existence that calls for explanation: their habit of \nlingering, even in the utterances of the educated, long after the circumstances which may \nonce have nourished them appear to have passed.11 The fact that in the closing decades of the \ntwentieth century, after nearly fifty years of peace and stability, the Germans could still on \noccasion figure in the political rhetoric of the well-briefed as Europe's prime warmongers and \noverlords-in-waiting alerts us to a lesson which medievalists in particular might take to heart: \nthat there is more to national stereotypes than meets the eye. Far from being mere substitutes \nfor thought, stereotypes can overlie and encode complex webs of ideas, assumptions, and \ncontroversies. If that observation holds good for modern national labels, it is unquestionably \nstill more applicable to medieval ones, which were deployed within a society where literate \npolitical discourse relied to a peculiar degree upon inherited literary models and rhetorical \ntechniques. An examination of medieval stereotypes soon reveals that, like their modern \ncounterparts, they were contentious and contested, serving above all as devices with which to \nargue. Yet the meanings which they bore could be multiple and ambiguous, their functioning \nwithin discourses of identity and power less self-evident than is often supposed \u2013 as this \npaper endeavours to show, by examining some of the contexts and conjunctions within which \none well-known stereotype was deployed. \n \nI \n \nThe history of the association between the Germans and war can be, and on occasion has \nbeen, made to appear both long and continuous.12 John of Salisbury, writing soon after the \nmiddle of the twelfth century, posed what was to become a celebrated rhetorical question \nwhen he demanded to know who set up the Germans \u2013 'this brutish and unruly people' \u2013 as \njudges over the nations of the earth.13 Such has been the modern resonance of his words that \nsome years ago a former president of the Monumenta Germaniae Historica felt the need to \ninsist, before an audience of American academics, that the turbulent history of the medieval \nReich may have explanations more complex than the German character traits identified by \nJohn.14 Read in their twelfth-century context, however, his remarks seem understandable \n \n \n2\nenough. So too does the proud boast of Gottfried of Viterbo, a member of Barbarossa's \nchancery, and John's contemporary, that 'German swords' could 'move earth and sea'.15 Both \nreflections originate, after all, in the heyday of imperial power under the Hohenstaufen, in a \ntime of military assertiveness by the Empire's German rulers. By as early as the eleventh \ncentury, the Germans had already won a reputation both for physical courage and, in the view \nof their Italian neighbours and victims, for ruthless violence.16 The associations suggested in \nthese instances \u2013 between war, the shaping of political identities, and their encapsulation in \ngroup stereotypes \u2013 thus appear to be familiar ones: broadly, those which have been traced in \nother European realms during the later Middle Ages. \nAs everyone knows, however, the German case is special, for the days of imperial \nglory were numbered. The history of German military triumph was in fact markedly \ndiscontinuous, and did not lead, before the nineteenth century, to those processes of political, \ninstitutional, and ideological consolidation around a nascent 'national' monarchy so often \ndetected in other parts of late medieval Europe. It therefore comes as something of a surprise, \nat the beginning of the sixteenth century, still to encounter utterances which seem more \nproperly to belong in the age of Barbarossa \u2013 such as Heinrich Bebel's assurance, proffered to \nKing Maximilian in 1501, that 'few peoples in the world have not, at one time or another, felt \nthe sharpness of German swords or have at least trembled at the terror of our name'.17 But the \nmilitant patriotism characteristic of educated Germans on the eve of the Reformation is well \nenough known, and it has generally been ascribed its own, particular and immediate, \ncauses.18 Alongside a strengthening anti-papal current, which itself nourished a keener \ninterest in the triumphs and tragedies of Germany's imperial past,19 an important new element \nhas been identified in the writings of Tacitus on the ancient Germans, rediscovered during the \nsecond half of the fifteenth century.20 There, German humanists thought they found a contrast \nmarked out which spoke directly to their most urgent anxieties and grievances: between the \nplain warrior virtues of their own putative forebears and the decadent vices of the Latin south. \nOn one view, modern stereotypes associating the Germans with a certain kind of harsh, \nmilitary primitivism have their origin in perceptions forged in the time of Erasmus and \nLuther.21 \n'Everything should be tried before iron. That is the view of the doctors, and emperors \ntoo have learned it by experience.' These words, put into the mouth of Charles IV, were \nwritten in 1351 in reply to the poet Petrarch, who had called on Charles to come into Italy \nand restore the ancient majesty of the Roman Empire.22 They appear not only to characterize \nwell Charles's own approach to rulership (during a thirty-two-year reign as king and emperor \n \n \n3\nhe did not involve himself in a single major war), but also to encapsulate aspects of late \nmedieval imperial government more generally.23 The two centuries that lay between the end \nof the Hohenstaufen dynasty and the consolidation of the Habsburgs on the imperial throne \noffer scant support for a vision of German military grandeur. It was not merely the fact that \nthe Empire's dwindling resources compelled a more limited, and pacific, style of rule than in \ntimes past. The whole standing of German arms appears diminished: by a series of military \ndeb\u00e2cles against the Bohemian Hussites, for example; or by the standing reproach \nrepresented by the advance into Europe of the Ottoman Turks.24 \nFar from withering away, however, images of German military valour, warrior \nkingship, and restless, untameable bellicosity proliferated in writings of this period as never \nbefore, as they came to be woven in new, fundamental ways into the fabric of German \nconstitutional and political debate. Not only that: assertions of Teutonic military supremacy \nappear to cluster especially in the troubled century between Frederick II's death in 1250 and \nthe imperial coronation, in 1355, of the Luxemburger Charles IV \u2013 a century which one \nrecent historian of the German monarchy has labelled the age of 'small kings', rulers \ndistinguished by their modest means and narrow horizons.25 'Just as there is a time of peace \nand a time of war', reflected the publicist Alexander of Roes, writing in 1281, 'so also there \nare men destined for peace and men destined for war'.26 First among the latter, Alexander \ninsisted, were his own German fellow-countrymen. Half a century later another German, \nConrad of Megenberg, explained how his people owed their name itself to their innate \nmilitary capabilities: they were a germen milicie \u2013 a 'race of warriors'.27 Nor was it only \nlearned and semi-learned treatise-writers who continued to harp on the theme of German \nbellicosity. Similar ideas are found not only among the chroniclers but also in the language of \nthe imperial chancery.28 The very gravity of the crises facing the Empire seemed in the eyes \nof some to call for a reawakening of the stern warrior aptitudes of its German bearers \u2013 a \nperception which underlies Alexander of Roes' demand that the prince-electors raise to the \nimperial throne 'a German knight \u2026 just like Charlemagne'.29 The persistence, and \namplification, of such ideas in an age which seemed to contemporaries, no less than modern \nscholars, so marked by crisis, instability, and contraction in German political life requires an \nexplanation. The interest of such an explanation lies in its potential to illuminate not only the \nhistorical development of ideas linking the German people with war, but also the relationship \nbetween medieval identities, stereotyping, and political power more generally. \n \nII \n \n \n4\n Any approach to the network of motifs associating the Germans with war must, however, \nbegin by recognizing something too often overlooked in the current pursuit of the medieval \n'nation': that the mix of ideas, assumptions, and sentiments which made up political identities \nin the Middle Ages varied between different peoples; and that, consequently, the stereotypes \ninto which such identities were condensed also differed, in their resonances, connections, and \nimplications. The medieval Empire was not like other European kingdoms, and the \nrelationship which the German people was during the late Middle Ages held to have with \nimperial power was likewise distinctive. The professed ideals of the Christian Roman Empire \nhad traditionally been militant: since the fifth century, prayers for the emperor had hoped for \nhis success in suppressing 'all barbarian [meaning pagan] peoples'.30 In the late Middle Ages \nthe liturgies for both the German (Aachen) and Roman coronations for the Empire's ruler \ncontinued to emphasize his duty to extend by successful war the frontiers of the Christian \ncommunity.31 The habitual formulations of the imperial chancery, faithful to the teachings of \nLatin theology and canon law, went on portraying the German monarch as a wielder of the \ngladius saecularis \u2013 a universal coercive power which, it was argued, complemented the \n'spiritual sword' entrusted to the priesthood.32 \nThe tradition which made the German people alone rightful custodians of the \nChristian Roman Empire was of less ancient origin. But by the second half of the thirteenth \ncentury it too had put down substantial roots in European constitutional thought. The \nconflicts of principle between the papacy and the Hohenstaufen, which came to a head in the \nfirst half of the century, had stimulated a closer scrutiny of the Empire's history and of the \nentitlements of its bearers. Innocent III's decretal Venerabilem, issued in 1202, became a \nfoundation for future discussions, with its clear ruling that the papacy had, in the time of \nCharlemagne, transferred to the Germans the right to nominate candidates for the imperial \nthrone.33 Admittedly, not everyone agreed either that the pope had been the author of the \nEmpire's translation or that it was under Charlemagne that imperial power had passed to the \nGermans.34 Nevertheless, Venerabilem did focus attention on one crucial question: why \nspecifically the Germans? Innocent himself had not directly answered it, but others soon did \n\u2013 such as the German canonist Johannes Teutonicus, who insisted that all acknowledge 'that \nthe Teutons by their virtues have won the Empire'.35 \nThe debate took on a new urgency after 1250, however. The Hohenstaufen dynasty's \nhold on the imperial crown had been broken; within a few years the German prince-electors \nhad placed on the throne an English and a Castilian prince; and the king of Bohemia too was \n \n \n5\nmore than once a candidate for the Empire.36 Most strikingly, the whole association of the \nGerman people with the imperial title was in these years brought into question. Venerabilem \nitself raised the possibility that what the papacy had given it might take away. Within a \ngeneration of Frederick II's death proposals were being advanced for a fundamental \nreorganization of the Empire and rumours circulated to the effect that the pope was planning \nto break up its territories.37 But the notion also surfaced that the imperial office itself might \nbe translated afresh, to some more fitting bearer.38 A suitable candidate appeared ready at \nhand, in the form of the French people, whose princes were able during the later thirteenth \ncentury to bask in the reflected glory of that paragon of Christian warrior-kingship, Louis \nIX.39 The strengthening French Carolingian tradition added its own note: had not \nCharlemagne himself been rex Francorum?40 Speculation was heightened by repeated \ndiplomatic manoeuvres, in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, to place a French \nprince on the imperial throne.41 It drew nourishment from popular prophecies which awaited \nthe coming of a new Charles, from the French royal line.42 French prestige, moreover, had a \ncounterpart in the scorn now being expressed in some quarters among the Germans' western \nneighbours for the universalist posturings of a people and of rulers in whose own German \nkingdom, as the Spanish canonist Vincentius put it, 'every hut usurps lordship for itself'.43 \nWhen the Empire's translation was discussed, questions about the relative suitability \nof different peoples \u2013 and thus, about 'national character' \u2013 were never far from the surface. \nThe very idea of translatio imperii \u2013 finding an appropriate custodian for an office understood \nprincipally in terms of protection and coercion \u2013 ensured a place for the language of ethnic \nstereotype at the heart of learned political speculation. Such language became a natural \nrecourse for the group of mainly German theorists and pamphleteers who in the two centuries \nafter 1250 set out to show the rightness of their own people's continuing tie with the \nEmpire.44 To establish the claims of the Germans to the Christian Roman heritage, they \nadopted two interwoven strategies: unfolding the long and illustrious history of warfare \nwaged by 'German' monarchs on behalf of the Church; and grounding the Empire's history \nand fate in an interpretation of German identity. \nTheir characteristic viewpoint, which compressed German into Frankish history, was \ncapable of endowing the Empire's bearers with an impressive military pedigree \u2013 one which, \nunparalleled in the world, stretched unbroken from Charles Martel to the emperors of the \ncentral Middle Ages, as the fourteenth-century publicist Lupold of Bebenburg explained.45 \nThe kings and emperors of the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries were shown leading \ntriumphant armies over the Alps, to free the church of Rome from the Lombards.46 Late \n \n \n6\nmedieval writers were able to cast over the raiding, plundering, and tribute-taking of the \nCarolingians and Ottonians the self-same legitimizing mantle that Frankish and Saxon \nchurchmen had once applied, of warfare and protection in the name of the Church.47 \nAlexander of Roes noted with satisfaction that Charlemagne had brought the Saxons into the \nChristian fold 'rather by the material than by the spiritual sword'.48 Lupold of Bebenburg \nrecounted how Henry I had taught the Northmen and the Danes, by force of arms, to bear the \nyoke of Christ, and how Otto II, his grandson, had so triumphed over the Slavs that they \nwillingly became both Christians and tributaries.49 To recount German history was to unfold \na story of sacred violence. Under the Hohenstaufen, the imperial mission of warfare for the \nFaith had crystallized in the belief that it was the emperor's duty to lead the crusade against \nthe heathen.50 This idea too proved long-lived. Dietrich of Niem, writing early in the fifteenth \ncentury, blamed the defeat of the multi-national crusading army at Nicopolis in 1396 on \nFrench usurpation of the place in the van that by tradition belonged to the Germans 'in all \nwars against the Saracens'.51 \n It was not without reason, the argument went, that the Germans had for so long been \nthe Church's strong arm. Dietrich's remark highlights a recurrent principle in German writings \non the Empire: that the Germans, alone among Europe's peoples, possessed the qualities \nwhich imperial rule demanded. These were, necessarily, qualities which were associated with \nthe ancient Romans, whose direct political heirs the Germans claimed to be. For medieval \npeople, the Romans were above all great soldiers and conquerors. German writers were \nunderstandably at pains to trace links between their forebears and a Roman past: through \nCaesar's conquests and foundations, and his settlement of Romans in Germany;52 through the \nRoman ancestry traced by some German dynasties;53 and through the aid which, in a popular \nand much-repeated tradition, the ancient Germans had given Caesar in wresting supreme \npower from the senate.54 By assimilating the Germans to the Franks \u2013 whose Trojan origins \nwere a long-established tradition \u2013 it became possible to claim a direct blood tie between \nRomans and Germans, and thus to portray the latter more credibly as the heirs to Roman \ncharacteristics.55 Alexander of Roes maintained that the Roman blood of the Germans was \nevident from their seriousness (which distinguished them from the frivolous French), and \nfrom their devotion to war and conflict.56 The moral was clear: barbarian peoples, Alexander \nobserved, flee before the eagles of the Romans and the Germans, whereas they have no fear \nof the lily of France.57 \n \nIII \n \n \n7\n What really concerned German writers was the supreme fitness for armed struggle that their \npeople's links with Rome affirmed. Here, it seemed, lay their fundamental title to the Empire. \nConrad of Megenberg, in a dialogue between a personified Ecclesia and the pope, has the \nChurch explain how, if the Germans were to lose the Empire, both she and the papacy would \nbe defenceless against tyrants.58 Alexander of Roes expressed succinctly what appears to \nhave been a widely held view when he described the entire German people as showing the \nqualities of a warrior nobility: collectively they constituted the militia of Latin Christendom, \nhence their indispensability to its defence.59 His perception did not lack a certain objective \nbasis: nobles and their values really did permeate to a striking degree the political life and \nculture of later medieval Germany. The hold exercised by local aristocratic families over \nGerman episcopal churches, and the consequent bellicosity of many of their incumbents, \nwere proverbial.60 In many German towns, ruling elites assimilated themselves to the martial \nculture and lifestyle of the landed nobility.61 Seen from this perspective, the infusion of \naristocratic priorities and standards of judgement into the imperial idea too becomes readily \ncomprehensible. \n'Verliuset Diutschiu zunge ir reht, daz wirt sie an eren swachen': should the Germans \n('the German tongue') lose their imperial title, it will undermine their honour. The words are \nfrom a verse composed soon after the middle of the thirteenth century by a singer known as \n'Mei\u00dfner'.62 If the Germans were, as Alexander claimed, Christendom's militia, that fact was \nattested by the singular honour that they had won, namely the Empire, which served as their \ncollective patent of nobility. It was not only learned publicists who thought this way. Timothy \nReuter has shown how profoundly imperial politics in twelfth-century Germany was founded \nupon notions of honour and status.63 In the following period, as the association between the \nEmpire and the German people became more explicit, the same modes of thought came to \ninfuse German identity itself. What marked the Germans out in their own estimation was \nsomething more personal than just success in war: it was the qualities of the soldier, a special \nrelationship with the heroic. The Germans were exemplars of strenuitas, animositas, \naudacia.64 And to a talent for fighting was joined a taste for it \u2013 'joy in battle', in one \nchronicler's phrase.65 In vernacular form, their qualities gained an epic ring: a successful or \nadmired ruler, like Rudolf of Habsburg or Henry VII, was for the poets a helt ('hero'), or a \ndegen ('mighty warrior').66 The chronicler Mathias of Neuenburg has Rudolf boast, after his \nvictory at Besan\u00e7on in 1289, that with just four German knights and forty footsoldiers he \ncould overcome any multitude.67 Privileged status, it was clear, required constant \n \n \n8\njustification: honour had to be vindicated, and blemishes made good. The German princes \u2013 \naccording to Venerabilem, the real beneficiaries of the Empire's translation \u2013 had a special \nresponsibility for performing, in company with the ruler, those feats of arms upon which their \npeople's standing depended. \nAt a time when imperial power was weak, and the German title to the Empire in some \ndoubt, a heavy burden of obligation was thus naturally laid at the princes' door. German \ncommentators addressed the problem of imperial renovatio in a language of honour, loyalty, \nand valour, and of their antitheses: cowardice, treachery, and shame. In an address, in \nGerman verse, to the princes met at Passau in 1348, the poet Lupold Hornburg portrayed the \nEmpire, in the guise of a beautiful woman, as denuded of her dignity. Her rulers had set aside \nthe heroism of their forebears, and now had time only for lies, deception, and the toadying of \nthe court. The Reich was in the hands of 'cowards', soft men who, Lupold lamented, 'do not \nthirst after honour'. Consequently, Germany herself 'stands in small regard'.68 The remedy \nwas plain: emperors and princes should rediscover the hard, martial habits of yore.69 Lupold's \ndiagnosis must appear somewhat surprising, in an age when some observers were identifying \nthe Germans' immoderate taste for sturmen and striten as a major cause of the Empire's \nenfeeblement.70 Yet it reflects a mode of thought whose naturalness for many literate \nGermans is attested by references in similar vein in the chronicles. The Strasbourg chronicler \nGottfried of Ensmingen records how 'the good name of the knighthood of the German realm' \nwas tarnished by the flight of a German nobleman in battle.71 Crucially, the opposing force \nhad included French-speakers. All was ultimately well, however, when in 1289 King Rudolf \nled his German forces in a triumphant campaign into the French-speaking south-west, 'in \norder to recover the honour and the good name of all of Germany'.72 It was war that had \nprovided the German militia with their imperial charter, and through war alone, waged in the \nEmpire's name, could they reaffirm it in time of need. \n \nIV \n \nIf medieval Germans habitually sought warlike qualities in their rulers, elements in the \npolitical life of the later Middle Ages conspired to ensure that such qualities came particularly \nto the fore. The elective imperial crown, firmly established in the second half of the thirteenth \ncentury, had its theoretical justification in the principle of idoneity \u2013 that the most suitable \ncandidate should be chosen.73 The needs of contemporary rulership no less than customary \nexpectation ensured that the ruler's military capacities got prominent mention in the formal \n \n \n9\ndeclarations of his personal qualities which the election procedure involved. In 1273 the \nelectors made known that the new king, Rudolf of Habsburg, was 'vigorous in body, and \nblessed with success in warfare against the wicked'.74 Such judgements were not confined to \nofficial pronouncements. The Swabian continuator of the Kaiserchronik observed that the \nprinces chose the count of Habsburg because, although not of Hohenstaufen blood ('von \nStoufen niht geborn'), he was \u2013 note once more the heroic strain \u2013 a man outstanding in \nvalour: 'an manhait uzerkorn'.75 \n The problems which German monarchs faced in establishing and maintaining \nthemselves on the throne seemed to call for the qualities of a warrior hero. If the Empire's \nrulers could not raise great armies against their neighbours, they were often forced to \nassemble smaller ones against their own subjects and rivals. The century after 1250 was \nmarked by split elections, by periodic spats with Roman and Avignon popes, and by \nchallenges from powerful imperial vassals.76 The crises of royal power and legitimacy that \nresulted were frequently resolved by armed force. The grinding military commitment that \nawaited a new king of uncertain title is illuminated by Count William of Holland, elected \nwith papal backing against the Staufer in 1248, who in the period to 1251 alone conducted \nthirteen separate sieges.77 Merely reaching Charlemagne's minster at Aachen for coronation \nnecessitated a six-month siege of the town, before William's army, reinforced by papal \ncrusaders, could force an entry. The fates of the rulers themselves reflect the tenor of the \ntime, with around half of the kings and emperors of the period meeting deaths linked to \nviolence \u2013 on the battlefield, on campaign, or under the assassin's blade.78 Pitched battle \nseveral times settled a seemingly intractable constitutional question.79  \n The task of governing the Empire's German territories was understood as an \nessentially military one, a view actually encouraged by the meagreness of the monarch's \nresources and the scale of the challenges facing him. The disordered state of the German \nlands is a recurrent lament of the chroniclers and, if their sentiments are at all representative \nof their fellow-countrymen, it is clear that establishing peace by suppressing local disorder \nand violent crime was the most urgent demand set before a ruler.80 A hint of what was hoped \nfor and required is provided by the Austrian chronicler Jansen Enikel, writing in the \nvernacular for an urban, burgher audience, in his account of Caesar's exemplary rulership: \n'The lord Julius \/ Thus made good peace \/ In all the German lands, \/ Because wherever his \npower was recognized, \/ There he was greatly feared'.81 Enikel ends with the characteristic \nreflection that Caesar's warlike deeds won him 'great honour'. \n \n \n10\nThe use of conspicuous military display to articulate and validate political authority \nwas a well-established \u2013 in the eyes of some a distinctive \u2013 part of German political life, and \nthe limited resources and urgent duties of rulership in the two centuries after 1250 helped to \nensure its perpetuation.82 Shows of armed force gained greater ideological significance, \nhowever, and a far more explicit association with notions of Germanness, when the ruler \nattempted to exercise power south of the Alps. There, German arms not only enforced but \nactually embodied imperial authority: a concession granted by Rudolf of Habsburg's vicar in \nTuscany relieved the Sienese of any obligation of fealty to the Empire until they should be \nvisited either by the monarch himself or by a force of at least five hundred German knights.83 \nBut for well-informed Germans the expeditions that their ruler led over the Alps in person \nhad a special significance. In the century after Frederick II's death these became both less \nnumerous and, when they did occur, distinctly more modest in scale, duration, and \nachievements than in times past.84 Yet literate Germans of the fourteenth century show a \ntelling determination to paint the short-lived and ill-starred ventures of Henry VII (1308-\n1313) and Ludwig the Bavarian (1314-1347) in the south in colours of militant triumph. \n What the chroniclers had in mind remains visible in a coloured drawing in the Codex \nBalduini Trevirensis, made in the circle of Baldwin of Luxemburg, archbishop of Trier \n(1307-1354). Henry VII, Baldwin's brother, is seen heading south over a stylised alpine ridge \nunder a forest of lances and imperial banners, amid a dense press of helmeted and mailshirted \nmen, the electors  among them.85 Crossing the Alps in military array was no mere act of rule, \nbut part of the necessary and accustomed spectacle of Empire: chroniclers understood this, \nand took care to see what tradition taught them they must.86 What is more, the journey south \nhad by the fourteenth century come to manifest, like few other tasks of government, the \nspecial relationship of the German people with imperial majesty. During preparations for an \naborted Italian expedition under Rudolf of Habsburg the bishop of Basel wrote to the king \nfrom Rome, urging him to assemble 'a band of warriors such as mighty Germania can \nnurture'.87 He took pains to impress on Rudolf the need for a truly magnificent show of force, \n'thereby gaining infinite glory for Germany and renown that will endure for many \ngenerations'. \n Triumphant show needed to be followed by triumphant deeds. Here too, writers were \nmoved to adopt a language of extravagant military success inherited from a more glorious \nGerman imperial past.88 The inconclusive street-fighting in which Henry VII became \nembroiled when he reached Rome in 1312 was transformed by the chroniclers into a \nsanguinary vindication of German animositas: men waded up to their knees in blood and the \n \n \n11\nTiber itself flowed red.89 Otto of Freising's celebrated quip, that Barbarossa's army paid the \nRomans for the imperial crown not in Arabian gold but Teutonic iron, is paralleled by \nsimilarly grim epigrams fathered on Henry VII.90 These \u2013 indeed the whole language of \nGerman military action in the south \u2013 illuminate a point of the greatest importance: that \nimages of German bellicosity only gained their full meaning when placed within larger \nnetworks of ethnic stereotypes. \nThe rhetoric of German triumph relied upon a parallel rhetoric, of subjection, \nhumiliation, and expropriation.91 Whether in the writings of publicists and pamphleteers, the \nnarratives of Latin and vernacular chroniclers, or the verses of poets and singers, we find the \nself-same amalgam of tendentious, counterposed, and mutually-supporting stereotypes. Just \nas the Germans were natural conquerors and rulers, so Italians were by nature subjects. For \nAlexander of Roes they were the populus to Germany's militia.92 The German people, says \nthe K\u00f6nigsaal chronicler 'was accustomed always to be victorious, and was therefore very \nready manfully to assail and put to flight the soft and feminine spirit of the Gauls' \u2013 meaning \nhere Italians.93 Not only the people, but their lands too were soft and feminine, rich and ripe \nfor exploitation, and thus naturally subject and tributary \u2013 hence the repeated reference in \nGerman sources of various kinds to the Empire's Italian territories as its 'garden', its 'pleasure \ngarden', or its 'orchard'.94 \n To find stereotypes deployed in this way can occasion little surprise. Is this not \nprecisely the language of domination and control, over a constructed, subordinate 'other', that \nwe have learned to expect self-styled 'imperial' peoples in any age to speak?95 Support for \nsuch a reading of the German evidence seems to come from a viewpoint which has in recent \ntimes found favour among medievalists. In a number of influential studies, the period \nbetween roughly the twelfth and fourteenth centuries has been ascribed a special significance, \nas a time when European powers and elites began to assert harsher and more exclusive kinds \nof dominance, supported by a new vocabulary of belonging and exclusion.96 Cultural \ndevelopments took a fundamental place within a larger pattern of strengthening hegemonies. \nIf boundaries of various sorts came in this period to be more assiduously policed, that was \npartly because they had been rendered more visible, and capable of more articulate \ndelineation, by a new battery of terms and concepts, derived in part from the revived study of \nAntiquity.97 Political relationships were naturally among those affected: literary models of \n'binary difference', often drawing upon classical distinctions between civilization and \nbarbarism, were applied to lend dominion and expropriation the stamp of the inevitable, the \nnatural, the God-given.98 There may have been only one Roman Empire in western Europe, \n \n \n12\nbut there were plenty of would-be empire-builders, and an inherited and rejuvenated \nrepertoire of stereotypes, the argument goes, furnished some formidable construction \nmaterials.99 \n \nV \n \nThe language of German imperialism, with its stress on military triumph over a naturally \nservile 'other', seems to suit such a picture precisely. Yet it is necessary only to recall the state \nof imperial rulership, both north and south of the Alps, in the decades after 1250 for it to \nbecome clear that the relationship between power and stereotyping must necessarily have \nbeen somewhat different in the German case. When German writers invoked images of heroic \nwarriorship and its antitheses their characteristic object was not to legitimize recent conquest \nor sustain novel claims to rule, but to affirm what they regarded as a time-honoured political \norder \u2013 'the pre-eminence of the Roman Empire', as Alexander of Roes put it \u2013 and to defend \nand celebrate the special status of its status-conscious German custodians.100 Such intentions \nare far removed from the confident, aggressively intolerant, 'state-building' climate in which \nsome historians locate the proliferation of stereotypes. The vocabulary of identity and \n'otherness', in German mouths of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, was an avowedly \nconservative one, uttered in a mood of crisis, against times which, especially for the Empire\u2019s \nbetter-informed and more widely travelled champions, seemed filled with dangerous \nnovelties. Most alarming of these was the challenge posed by that upstart rival militia whose \nshadow loomed beyond the western frontier: the kingdom of France, its people, and its 'most \nChristian' kings.101 \n German writers were accustomed to describe their Romance-speaking neighbours, \nwhether south of the Alps or west of the Meuse, in strikingly similar ways. Even much of the \nterminology was common: Italians or French, all were Walhen in the vernacular and, on \noccasion at least, Gallici in Latin.102 The character traits supposedly distinctive to the two \npeoples were also to some degree common, serving to locate both in the self-same subjection \nto the Germans. The French, no less than the Italians, emerge from German writings as an \neffeminate people, calling for tutelage and a firm hand.103 It was an imputation that suited \nperfectly the objectives of German treatise-writers, keen to banish the spectre of an \nimpending translatio imperii in Francos. Conrad of Megenberg's Ecclesia thus urged the pope \nnot to charge the Empire's shield with the lilies of France, 'which are soft and womanish'.104  \n \n \n13\nIt thus comes as no surprise to encounter the French, in German writings, repeatedly \nfailing the key test of fitness for imperial rule: trial by battle. Like the Italians, they are \ndismissed as hopelessly ineffective soldiers. The claim was no mere utilitarian confection of \nthe publicists, who here invoked more deep-rooted German attitudes; 105 but it was an idea \nthat imperialist treatise-writers were particularly assiduous in exploiting. In his Noticia seculi \nof 1288, written soon after the troubled end of Charles of Anjou's reign, Alexander of Roes \nhad a moral to point. Their recent military setbacks, he explained, were but a foretaste of the \nchastisement that awaited the French, should they continue to claim a role for which they \nwere manifestly not fitted: nature had allocated them pacific functions within the Christian \ncommonwealth, as scholars and clerks; yet 'they strive, like Teutons and warriors, to be cruel \nand bellicose men and plunderers'.106 The French presumption which Dietrich of Niem \nthought had betrayed the Christian cause at Nicopolis was, from a German point of view, no \nisolated lapse, but one further instance of a familiar habit, of usurping positions of command \nwhich rightly belonged to their eastern neighbour. To the faint-heartedness characteristic of \nWalhen generally, the French \u2013 who affected a fashionable chivalric swagger and stretched \nout their hand for the imperial crown itself \u2013 added evil and dangerous traits of their own: \nself-deluding vanity and the grave sin of pride.107 \nIn Alexander's view, not only were the French less manly, and thus less warlike, than \nthe Germans; they were also their juniors \u2013 a kindred but later offshoot of the Frankish \nfamily.108 The position which he ascribed them as Christendom\u2019s natural clerks (clerus) \nsimilarly de-sexed and disarmed them, and placed them under the protection of the Empire\u2019s \nGerman militia.109 His reflections on the subject of German and French 'national character' \nillustrate powerfully how ethnic stereotypes, far from being mere thoughtless tags of abuse or \nself-flattery, could take a central place within deliberate and ambitious arguments. Alexander \nknew well how to set stereotypes to work for him \u2013 not only to laud his fellow-Germans but \nalso, no less importantly, to display their Italian subjects in fitting attitudes of subjection and \nto name and shame their most menacing rivals. Listing and classifying within hierarchical \nschemes was a habit congenial to educated medieval minds.110 It was no mere intellectual \ngame, however: when Alexander shuffled stereotypes to support his view of the right order in \nhuman affairs, he did so in response to other contemporary schemes of stereotyping, which \nwere arguing for a quite different order. It is the outstanding qualities of the French, he \nadmits, that prompt some to see them as candidates for the Empire.111 The Germans, by \ncontrast, are condemned by their critics as rude and uncultivated: how, such persons ask, can \nthey govern the whole of Christendom, when even their own dress and manners are so \n \n \n14\ndisorderly?112 Alexander believed he could rebut such frivolous objections. Yet the terms in \nwhich he was led to defend his fellow-countrymen, and the concessions which he felt \ncompelled to make to their critics, prompt as many questions as they answer. \n \nVI \n \nThe Germans too, Alexander conceded, had their faults: not only the coarseness of which \ntheir French rivals indicted them, but also cruelty, rapacity,  and an innate love of quarrels.113 \nIt is hard to see how Alexander's medieval readers could wholly have escaped the reflection, \nobvious to modern ones, that a people marked by such vices was perhaps not so incontestably \nfitted for the guardianship of Christendom after all. The light which his words casts upon the \nmore troubling dimensions of German bellicosity encourages closer scrutiny of some of the \ncelebrations of German valour found in other writings. It is easy to understand why, for \nexample, the K\u00f6nigsaal chronicler gave prominence to Henry VII's martial entry into Rome; \nbut what is to be made of his picture of the emperor's German forces cutting a swathe through \nthe city's Italian defenders 'like ravening wolves among defenceless sheep'?114 In fact, \nalthough German writers mostly deployed references to their people's bellicosity in what they \nintended as positive ways, the actual characteristics which they invoked were by no means \nself-evidently flattering, but rather, at best, troublingly ambiguous. \nUnder the year 1336 the chronicler John of Winterthur notes that the king of Hungary \nhad broken off a military campaign because, on one report, he dreaded the advent of the \nGermans (especially the Swabians, adds John), 'and fled as if before a whirlwind or a raging \ntempest (tempestatem furiosam)'.115 On this if on little else the Germans and their southern \nand western neighbours were of one mind: the Teutons were a furious people.116 But was \nresembling a raging tempest a reputation to cherish, or one to live down? Does German furor \nbelong in the category of 'positive' or of 'negative' stereotypes \u2013 or does it in fact permit any \nsuch absolute view?117 Its use by German writers was certainly in most cases clearly \nlaudatory.118 Viewed from the south, however, the picture was very different. Petrarch \nsummed up what he judged to be the essence of Italian superiority over the northern \nneighbour in a stark antithesis: vert\u00f9 contra furore.119 If furor Teutonicus was a familiar \nrhetorical clich\u00e9, it was nevertheless one with potentially complex significance: in German \nwritings a proud boast, affirming ancient titles to power; in Italian ones a bitter, shaming \nreproach hurled at the wild men beyond the mountains. Yet the picture is in fact more \ncomplex still: the furious ways of the Teutons, it soon becomes clear, gave northerners too \n \n \n15\noccasional cause to reflect.120 A purely functional interpretation of the theme of German fury \nwill not therefore suffice, since its meaning, and thus its purpose, varied sharply in line with \ndifferent authorial standpoints, traditions, and objectives.121 What is needed instead is an \napproach capable of illuminating something of the range of images and associations which \nthe motif invoked. For this, it is necessary to follow furor Teutonicus back to its origins. \nThe phrase was a coinage of the Roman poet Lucan, recounting the incursions which \nGermanic tribes \u2013 the Cimbri and the Teutones \u2013 had made into the Empire at the end of the \nsecond century BC.122 It entered medieval writings during the Investiture Contest, by which \ntime Lucan's ancient Teutones had become contemporary Teutons, and it gained acceptance \non both sides of the Alps in the course of imperial campaigns in Italy in the twelfth and \nthirteenth centuries. The idea of behaviour inspired by innate 'fury' calls for some scrutiny, \nsince it had deep roots in medieval literate culture, and tended naturally to invoke a range of \nfurther, kindred motifs. A furious people might indeed, in the medieval view, gain a name for \nmartial prowess and conquest: for Oderic Vitalis, writing in the twelfth century, furor \ndistinguished the Normans.123 It was nonetheless a rather different quality from fortitude: a \nman fleeing a battlefield in blind panic could be termed a furibundus.124 At its heart lay \nsurrender to some overmastering passion. For Roman writers like Lucan, furor was a defining \nfeature of the 'other' beyond the frontier: Romans may have been outstanding warriors, but in \nAntique thought barbarians alone were furious ones.125 Classical conceptions of barbarism \nstruck early and lasting roots in medieval Europe\u2019s scholarly tradition, gaining a fresh \nprominence in the intellectual currents of the central Middle Ages.126 Albertus Magnus, who \nwrote in Germany during the troubled thirteenth century, observed that the barbarian, unlike \nthe civilized man, 'is moved \u2026 by unreasoning fury, lust, and self-delusion'.127 Fury, to the \neducated medieval mind, inescapably called forth a cluster of alarming cognate qualities, \nassociated with the Antique image of the barbarian: manners untutored by reason; backward \nand disorderly political arrangements; and a cruel, ill-disciplined, and predatory style of war. \nIt is necessary only to recall Alexander\u2019s damning claim, that the French aspired to \nequal the Germans in cruelty and plundering, for it to become evident that Teutonic martial \nvirtues were, for educated Germans scarcely less than for hostile outsiders, inseparable from \nsome plainly barbarian shortcomings. Others confirmed Alexander\u2019s view that Germans \nmade harsh soldiers.128 To cruelty, moreover, was joined, in German portrayals of their \ncompatriots at war, a rashness in battle and a characteristically heedless rush for booty that on \noccasion proved militarily counterproductive.129 For Italian commentators, many \ncharacteristic evils of the northern way of fighting \u2013 cruelty, greed, injustice \u2013 were \n \n \n16\ncondensed into the deeds of German mercenary bands in the south in the fourteenth \ncentury.130 For some Germans too, the condottieri had a part (though a far smaller one than \nfor Italians) in shaping a dark vision of their people in arms: Conrad of Megenberg reflected \nthat Germans who joined professional companies fought unjust wars, since it was their arms \nthat kept in power the tyrants of Lombardy.131 For Isidore of Seville, it might here be noted, \nwhat drove men to wage unjust wars was furor.132 \n \nVII \n \nIt was not only on the battlefield that barbarian motifs crowded in upon the Germans. In the \naccounts of some of their southern and western neighbours, the unreasoning fury of the \nTeutons was portrayed as robbing them of their very humanity, hence the range of 'bestial' \nqualities with which Italian and French writers were inclined to surround them: an alleged \naversion to washing, disgusting table manners, want of dress sense, habitual drunkenness;133 \nand the German language itself, compared on occasion with the roaring of lions or with a \nterrible thunder, but also with the barking of dogs, the howling of wolves, and the croaking of \nfrogs.134 If in German eyes the Empire's Italian 'garden' represented nature tamed and \nharnessed, Italian viewpoints portrayed Germany as nature run wild, raging, unbounded, and \nuncultivated. Petrarch wrote of the clouds from the north shedding an 'iron rain' of criminal \nsoldiery on his native land.135 \nThe fully developed picture of the German barbarian was unfolded in French and \nItalian writings, and it is to these that it is necessary to turn to observe most clearly the \ninterconnection of the image's various component themes. German views were naturally \nmore muted. Yet the unflattering perspectives which Romance-speakers laid out were no \ncalumnies of their own recent fabrication, but elements drawn and re-fashioned from a \nliterate culture in which all educated Europeans had a share. For Germans too they were \ninescapable \u2013 particularly for those Germans who went in search of a literary pedigree for the \nclaims of Teutonic arms. Consequently, some of the same motifs for the German lands and \ntheir inhabitants \u2013 motifs stressing the raw, the outsized, and the immoderate \u2013 are \nencountered in German writings also. Sometimes they were given what appears to be a \npositive colouring. More than one German writer spoke warmly of the immense stature and \nsturdy physique of his fellow-countrymen.136 The view that Teutons were robusti was one \nwhich enjoyed general agreement, and which in the later Middle Ages was reinforced by an \norigin myth tracing their descent from a giant.137 But neither could Germans choose to \n \n \n17\noverlook those troublesome barbarian failings \u2013 dull-wittedness, gluttony, drunkenness, \ninurbanitas, as well as a taste for blood \u2013 with which their neighbours charged them. Some \nGermans had experienced French and Italian scorn at first hand. The humanists were not the \nfirst generation of educated northerners whose self-consciousness was moulded by travel: \nAlexander of Roes, Conrad of Megenberg, and Dietrich of Niem are among those who spent \nlengthy periods at the papal Curia at Rome and Avignon. Each of them recounts in some \ndetail, from evident personal acquaintance, the faults which in their time others were laying at \ntheir people's door.138 \nJust as important, however, was the influence exerted by literary tradition. The \nchronicles of the early Middle Ages, and the regional historical memories which they \nnourished, kept before the eyes of thirteenth- and fourteenth-century Germans an image, if \nnot quite of the vices, then at least of the elemental, untutored ferocity of their forebears. The \nvernacular Sch\u00f6ppenchronik, begun in official circles in fourteenth-century Magdeburg, \ndepicts the ancient Franks warning their king against an alliance with the Saxons, who were \n'a wild, untamed people'.139 The etymologies of tribal names preserved comparable ideas in \neasily-memorable form. Lupold of Bebenburg was just one of those to repeat the well-worn \ncommonplace that the Franks were so-called because they were 'fierce'.140 By land and sea \nalike the Saxons were 'intractable and rock-hard', according to the Franciscan encyclopedist \nBartholomaeus Anglicus, who taught at Magdeburg in the thirteenth century.141 \nThe literary inheritance of Latin Antiquity, however, shaped in particularly deep and \ncompelling ways the late medieval image of the German. The belief sometimes encountered, \nthat the rediscovery of Tacitus first introduced literate Germans to classical thought about \ntheir character and ancestry, is far from the truth \u2013 though it did, unquestionably, enrich their \nview of Germanic prehistory.142 Although the Germania and the Annales had fallen into \nobscurity in medieval Europe, other Antique works reflecting Roman views of the barbarian \ncontinued to be read.143 The chronicler John of Viktring, for example, was able to draw on \nwritings by Josephus, Vegetius, and Isidore for his observations on the inhospitable German \nclimate and the ferocity, huge size, and physical strength of the natives.144 Isidore alone (who \nhad emphasized the rapacity of the gentes Germaniae as well as their fortitude) bequeathed to \nlater centuries an eloquent and widely-invoked conspectus of barbarian qualities.145 However \nmuch German writers sought to concentrate on the seemingly more laudable elements in their \npeople's inherited image, its alarming resonances in ancient thought could never be wholly \nsuppressed.146 \n \n \n \n18\nVIII \n \nIf the ethnic topoi handed down to literate Germans of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries \nwere there to be used, they had also somehow to be coped with. The vocabulary of ideas and \nconcepts which they yielded facilitated, and supplied a structure for, those arguments, claims, \nand controversies which in the decades after Frederick II's death helped to constitute a \ndeepened sense of Germanness. Yet while Germans had considerable scope to manipulate \ntheir inherited stock of autostereotypes, they could not simply abolish it, nor could they easily \nadd to it or ignore its individual elements. The authority of the past set its own agenda, and \nGerman writers were in some measure the servants, as well as the architects, of the ideas \nupon which their people's identity rested. One way of coping was to confront directly some of \nthe more disturbing components of the classical tradition, and apply them to the analysis of \ncontemporary German society. Given the intimate links between warfare and government in \nGerman thinking, the more blameworthy elements in the German style of war which some \nwriters conceded could scarcely have failed to have political repercussions. Was it any \ncoincidence, some asked, that German public life appeared so bloody and chaotic?147 The \nrapacity identified by Alexander of Roes was just one German failing that could not easily be \nconfined to the battlefield. Lupold of Bebenburg is among those who pilloried the German \nprinces as thieves and raptores, whose short-sighted selfishness was endangering German \npossession of the Empire itself.148 The problem was not merely the ambition or self-interest \nof the leaders of German society but, as stereotype seemed to show, their reckless \nimpulsiveness, which drove the Germans not only to plunder others, but also themselves. \nAlexander of Roes, as so often, sums up the view of literate Germans of his age in his \nplaintive wish that his fellow-countrymen might learn foresight.149 \nIt was Conrad of Megenberg, however, who took the further step of relating the \nlessons of Antique ethnology directly to the problems of governing fourteenth-century \nGermany. One powerful source of conflicts, he admitted, was the elective crown. But matters \nwere not helped by 'the fury (furor) and impatience of the German people, through which \nquarrels are sown among them daily'.150 Conrad offered an analysis of the German \ntemperament which borrowed ideas from Aristotle, and reflected theories about the northern \nbarbarian widely held in the learned world of the ancient Mediterranean.151 The Germans, he \nexplained, live far from the sun, and the speed and quantity of their blood, from which they \nhave their boldness, account also for their rashness.152 The evil proclivities to which birth and \nenvironment gave rise were, Conrad believed, aggravated by social attitudes commonly \n \n \n19\nencountered among Germans. His fellow-countrymen, he lamented, dismissed learned \nknights as 'book-eaters' and, training up their own young in physical arms alone, sent them \noff to war unarmed with the prudence that overcomes mere brute strength.153 Here was \nanother lesson with relevance beyond the battlefield, in an age in which reason, honed by \nbook learning, was coming to seem an essential foundation not only for military success but \nfor the exercise of all public power and authority.154 \nApplying the language of ethnic stereotype so explicitly to the ills of contemporary \nGerman society was a high-risk strategy, however \u2013 one which was always prone to highlight \nthe seeming incongruity of a people so infused with barbarian traits sporting the mantle of \nimperial Rome.155 Qualities which, in the formulations of ancient writers, were synonymous \nwith a fundamental incapacity for orderly political life sat uncomfortably beside German \nclaims to universal power. At a time when good government was widely held to be founded \non reason, unreasoning wildness inevitably looked to some less like a charter for rule than a \ndisqualification.156 Exactly those qualities which some Germans perceived in their own \npolitical life \u2013 fragmentation, discontinuity, violence, cruelty, irregularity \u2013 were ones which \nelsewhere in Europe were being cited as arguments for the fundamental unfitness of certain \npeoples to manage their own affairs, and thus for their rightful subjection to other, more \nadvanced, powers.157 Indeed, Germans themselves invoked on occasion a very similar \nrepertoire of negative attributes in order to portray as backward \u2013 and thus, in some instances \nat least, to claim authority over \u2013 the peoples beyond their own eastern and north-eastern \nfrontiers: Bohemians, Poles, Hungarians, Scandinavians, and Baltic pagans.158 \nThe treatise-writers of the later Middle Ages \u2013 the most articulate and self-conscious \nscrutineers of the German character \u2013 were therefore on the whole loathe to ponder too \ndeeply the constitutional implications of those failings which tradition laid at their people's \ndoor. Instead, they tended to concentrate on deliberately minimizing the significance of the \nmore troubling aspects of the ancient image of the German, or on re-casting as strengths their \npeople's alleged shortcomings, and arguing that the truly harmful political vices were those of \ntheir over-civilized neighbours and rivals.159 The arguments of the publicists adopted a series \nof polarities, which aimed to make the best of their people's inherited barbarian image \u2013 \npitting the battlefield against the court, the open-hearted soldier against the deceitful flatterer, \nand hard deeds against vain words. The German is indeed a glutton, agrees Conrad of \nMegenberg's Ecclesia, 'but in war he hurries as if in courtly service'.160 Dietrich of Niem was \nanother writer who conceded charges of German coarseness and hard drinking, only to \ncontrast approvingly the honest simplicity of past emperors with the worldly vanities of the \n \n \n20\nschismatic Curia.161 By equating courtliness with corruption, servility, and cowardice, \nGerman writers were able to present the boorishness which both literary tradition and \ncontemporary critics found in their own people as at worst a venial shortcoming, if not actual \nevidence of underlying virtue. \nThe view which contrasted wholesome Germanic severity with the soft and \ndegenerate ways of the south and west was therefore no invention of the humanists, but one \nwhich gained wide currency among literate Germans in course of the crises and debates of \nthe later Middle Ages. Indeed, Germans of the Lutherzeit were to forge their own arguments \nin substantial part out of the rich chronicle and publicist literature that flowed from German \npens between the mid-thirteenth and mid-fifteenth centuries.162 At the heart of this lay a view \nof the German warrior, of his plain, homely merits, and of the high rewards which these had \nearned his people. Yet the closing centuries of the Middle Ages had taught the Empire's \nGerman supporters some troubling lessons, which their writings could not wholly obscure: \nthat in a treacherous world virtue does not invariably have its reward, and that the guileless \nTeutonic hero could not in fact be counted on always to conquer. Mathias of Neuenburg \nrecounts a cautionary tale from the battle of Cr\u00e9cy, where \u2013 in a striking parallel to Dietrich \nof Niem's account of Nicopolis \u2013 the defeated French had first seized the van, in arrogant \ndisregard of their German and Bohemian allies, only to flee the field, abandoning the \nGermans, who stood firm, to be slaughtered.163 It was left to the victorious Edward III \u2013 who \nas a warrior-king could speak with authority in the matter \u2013 to lament the fallen Germans, and \nto reflect how much better he would have rewarded them than had the treacherous French. \nHere was without question a morality story for patriotic Germans; but was its message on the \nwhole a reassuring or a disheartening one? As Conrad of Megenberg \u2013 writing not long after \nthe events of 1346 \u2013 had pointed out, unless joined with cunning, German prowess offered \nscant hope of triumph. Barbarian warrior virtues, no less than turbulent barbarian vices, were \ncoming to seem increasingly anachronistic in a world in which arms-bearing had long ago \nceased to be equated with ruling \u2013 a world in which, indeed, the universal soldier would soon \ntake up his place not among the masters, but the servants.164 \n \nIX \n \nNew Romans or irredeemable barbarians, lords of the world or hired butchers? If there was \none thing that the late medieval image of the Germans at war evidently did not do it was \nprovide the kind of easy answers to na\u00efve questions which, it is often maintained, account for \n \n \n21\nthe appeal of national stereotypes to dull minds throughout the ages. Medieval clich\u00e9s about \nthe warmongering Teutons, all too predictable and readily explicable in some modern eyes, \nturn out to be anything but. Instead, we seem to be faced with a stereotype that will not obey \nthe rules, and that turns on its head much conventional wisdom. Its German subjects \nthemselves appear as deeply paradoxical figures: a martial race whose laurels from the \nbattlefields of late medieval Europe were few and far between; consummate warlords who \nproved notoriously incapable of constructing the kind of institutionalized war machine whose \nassembly in other regions of late medieval Europe is still applauded by some historians as a \nkey measure of national achievement. All the signs are that the theme of German belligerence \nwas reaching its largest medieval public, attracting unprecedentedly close scrutiny, and \nwinning the most wholehearted affirmation from informed commentators, at just the time \nwhen Germany's political institutions appeared fatally shrunken and debilitated, their \nideological foundations held up to question as never before. The paradoxes do not end there, \nhowever. It seems hard to regard either as a mere piece of casual abuse or as a cunningly-\nwrought weapon of dominion a stereotype which evidently commanded such substantial \ncross-cultural consensus: whether among the German people's most patriotic champions or its \nsharpest Italian detractors, among devout believers in the universal mission of the late \nmedieval Reich or natural sceptics, the view of the Germans as unrivalled exemplars of a kind \nof unadorned military ferocity found wide agreement. The sort of approach which sees \n'national' stereotypes as purpose-made vehicles for the delivery of some single, reassuringly \nstraightforward, judgement on a people will not work in this case: if the inherent bellicosity \nof the Germans was a premise enjoying general assent, different writers derived from it \nsharply varying, indeed fundamentally opposed, conclusions. \n German identity in the Middle Ages was at all times complex. The stresses and strains \nto which German political society was subject in the decades after Frederick II's death \nrendered its complexities more acute and more evident, and exposed them to new, more \nsystematic and widespread, kinds of consideration. Some of the starkest tensions and \ncontradictions within late medieval notions of Germanness were illuminated by the \nassociation with war \u2013 illuminated but, crucially, not resolved. Where, commentators were \ncompelled to ask themselves, did 'Germanness' in its essence lie? And where, we are bound to \nadd, lay that 'other' which much current thinking on the subject of identity invites us to \ndiscern behind every account of collective selfhood? Nowhere settled or straightforward, is \nevidently the answer to both questions. \n \n \n22\nA sense of being German was, in a twofold fashion, defined to an unusual degree \nfrom the outside. First, it was rendered especially visible through journeys \u2013 specifically, \nthrough journeys over the Alps, and, most characteristically, through the movement of forces \nof armed men.165 It was over the Alps that, at some time in the remote past, were believed to \nhave come those migrant bands of soldiers \u2013 Trojans, Macedonians, Armenians \u2013 who were \nin legend the ancestors of the various German descent groups. Roman armies too had come \nnorth; and German warbands, it was popularly supposed, had gone south to Caesar's aid. \nImages of German soldiers crossing the Alps at the behest of 'caesar' remained in the late \nMiddle Ages a powerful \u2013 for some fourteenth-century writers, an indispensable \u2013 \nencapsulation of the imperial identity of the Germans. To grasp why that was so, it must be \nnoted that the very idea of Germanness \u2013 of a political identity common to all the Germanic \nlanguage groups within the medieval Empire \u2013 had first taken shape after the Saxon emperors \nbegan, in the tenth century, to lead armies into Italy.166 The long heritage of armed journeying \nensured that in a second sense too German identity was historically defined from without: \nthrough the constructions of 'the German' proposed at various times by those neighbouring \npeoples \u2013 particularly Romance-speakers \u2013 with whom the northerners had down the \ncenturies come into contact. The earliest, tenth- and eleventh-century, references to 'the \nGermans' as a single people, and to their lands, are thus to be found not in German but in \nnorth Italian and Burgundian writings.167 \nMuch of the substance of German identity, therefore, lay elsewhere: outside \n'Germany', south of the Alps, embedded within an imperial inheritance attainable only \nthrough (actual or imagined) travel. And where was its corresponding 'other' to be found? \nNot, alas, safely confined among those neighbouring races within whose supposedly \nunwarlike characteristics some late medieval Germans were at such pains to locate it, but in \nplaces disturbingly close to home: irremovably rooted within the images of a turbulent, \nbarbarian, selfhood from whose shadow late medieval Germans could not hope (and, indeed, \nnever wholeheartedly wanted) to escape. 'Barbarian Germany', it might be said, existed in a \nperpetual, troubling, though in certain ways fruitful, dialogue with a parallel and \ninterpenetrating 'imperial Germany' \u2013 with the fund of memories, traditions, and titles upon \nwhich were founded the historic claims of the Germans to uniqueness. It was above all in \nreflections about war that the two currents met and merged. \n The mood of crisis, defensiveness, and perceived decline which often underlies late \nmedieval writings touching on questions of German identity, far from straining traditional \nlinks between the Germans and notions of martial prowess, supplied some urgent impulses \n \n \n23\n \n \n24\nfor their multiplication and reinforcement.168 It did so in a number of different ways, \nhowever: the stereotype of the bellicose Teutons proved capable of satisfying simultaneously \nvarious diverse \u2013 indeed, to some extent contradictory \u2013 explanatory needs. The view which \nascribed to the Germans a special relationship with warfare endured, and gathered adherents, \nin the decades after 1250, not because it had one, particular and inescapable, message to \nconvey, but because it did not. On the contrary, it was its unsettled (and unsettling), \nambivalent, and debatable character that explains much of its attractiveness, at a time when \ndoubts and questions, more than firm certainties, supplied the core of German identity. There \nare insights here, into the development of political communities, and into the functioning of \nthose arguments and discourses from which they are constituted, with applicability beyond \nthe German case \u2013 and beyond the late Middle Ages. Collective stereotypes, and the ramified \nidentities which they focused and energised, amounted to more than mere shadows cast on \nsociety by the institutions of the nascent 'modern state'. The interactions which they attest, \nbetween cultural tradition, vital political discourse, and the power of government, were \u2013 and \nare \u2013 richer, more complex, less predictable, and less linear than has often been supposed. \nNot only confident assertiveness, aggression, and growth, but also a shared sense of \ndiminution, and sentiments of nostalgia and disappointment, can be powerful stimuli to \ncertain kinds of collective identity. Empires in their heyday may wage wars; but it is part of \nthe melancholy lot of fading imperial powers to commemorate and to interpret, to ritualize \nand to mythologize war, and to draw from bygone conflicts lessons \u2013 whether comforting, \ndisturbing, or both \u2013 with which to face an unappealing present and uncertain future. \n \nGermen militiae: notes \n \n1 I am grateful to the participants in seminars and conferences at the universities of \nDurham, Huddersfield, Leeds, Sheffield, and York, who heard and commented upon papers \non which this essay is based. \n \n2 Margaret Thatcher to a 'foreign-policy adviser', 1989, cited in Eric J.

John of Winterthur, writing \nshortly before the middle of the fourteenth century, believed that all German kings and \nemperors since Rudolf's time had met violent deaths: Die Chronik Johanns von Winterthur, \ned. Baethgen, 68; and according to the K\u00f6nigsaal chronicler, Henry VII reflected that \nGermans had been responsible for the killing both of Bohemian kings and of recent rulers of \nthe Empire (with Adolf and Albert explicitly named): K\u00f6nigsaaler Geschichts-Quellen, ed. \nLoserth, 266-7. \n \n79 Examples: 1278 (Rudolf's victory over the rebellious vassal Otakar); 1298 (Albert I's \nclaim to throne vindicated against King Adolf); 1322 (Ludwig the Bavarian's claim to throne \nvindicated against rival candidate, Frederick of Habsburg).

Potthast, 228. Alexander of Roes, \nit might be noted, had insisted that the Germans were custodians of the Christian sheepfold, \nnot its violators: Memoriale, cap. 36, ed. Grundmann and Heimpel, 146 (figuratively equating \nSt Peter's pastoral staff with the Empire, by which the 'ravening wolf' is driven off). \n \n115 Die Chronik Johanns von Winterthur, ed.

The view is also common in the writing of \nmedievalists on the subject: thus, on the allegedly 'black and white' quality of medieval \nstereotypes, Guen\u00e9e, States and Rulers, 65. \n \n118 For the K\u00f6nigsaal chronicler, it was the furor Teutonicus of Henry VII's troops, \nsynonymous with boldness in battle, that overcame the Romans, Henry's own furor that \nbrought the Brescians to their knees: K\u00f6nigsaaler Geschichts-Quellen, ed. Loserth, 343, 347. \nFor further examples of the use, in broadly positive ways, of furor Teutonicus and cognate \nphrases in late medieval German writings, see: Ellenhardi chronicon, ed.

It might be noted that in Ambrogio Lorenzetti's fresco cycle \nof 1338-9 in the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena, illustrating the character and effects of good and \nevil government, the allegorical figure of furor is placed in company with tyranny, division, \nand war. See Quentin Skinner, 'Ambrogio Lorenzetti: the Artist as Political Philosopher', \nProceedings of the British Academy, lxxii (1986), 33. \n \n120 See below, **-**. \n 24\n 121 Functionalist approaches, which view stereotypes as tools fashioned to justify \nparticular forms of social behaviour or to cope with perceived threats to society, remain \npopular among medievalists: thus, for example, Moore, Persecuting Society, 98; Richards, \nSex, Dissidence and Damnation, 19; and, for ethnic stereotypes, Menache, 'Symbols and \nnational stereotypes', 191. Theoretical treatments have adopted the same standpoint: Gilman, \nDifference and Pathology, 16-21; and, for an influential older study, Gordon W. Allport, The \nNature of Prejudice (Boston, Mass., 1954), 191. \n \n122 For this and what follows, see D\u00fcmmler, '\u00dcber den furor Teutonicus'. \n \n123 G.A.

Grundmann and Heimpel, 114. \nAlexander's French contemporary, William of Nangis, by contrast, argued that chivalry was \none of the three elements symbolically represented by the French lily, along with learning, \nand with Faith, which chivalry and learning alike supported: Herbert Grundmann, \n'Sacerdotium \u2013 Regnum \u2013 Studium: Zur Wertung der Wissenschaft im 13.
