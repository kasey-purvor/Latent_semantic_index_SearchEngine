The\nexisting literature on supply chain vulnerability and risk management is reviewed and\ncompared with findings from exploratory interviews undertaken to discover practitioners\u2019\nperceptions of supply chain risk and current supply chain risk management strategies.\n3SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT:\nOUTLINING AN AGENDA FOR FUTURE RESEARCH\nINTRODUCTION\nOn an individual firm basis, companies have been aware of the need for risk management and\ncontingency planning for some considerable time and there exists a wide body of literature\nfrom such diverse fields as economics (e.g. Kahnemann and Tversky, 1979; Tversky and\nKahnemann, 1992), finance (e.g. Smith et al., 1990), strategic managememt (e.g. Bettis and\nThomas, 1990; Simons, 1999) and international management (e.g. Miller, 1992; Ting, 1988).\nRecent events have vividly demonstrated that a disruption affecting an entity anywhere in the\nsupply chain can have a direct effect on a coporation\u2019s ability to continue operations, get\nfinished goods to market or provide critical services to customers. Organisations that think\nthey have managed risk have often overlooked the critical exposures along their supply\nchains. As noted by Braithwaite and Hall (1999), supply chains that run to hundreds if not\nthousands of companies over several tiers present significant risk. Some writers suggest that\nthe domino effects of disruptions in supply chains might have been exacerbated in the last\ndecade (Christopher and Lee, 2001; McGillivray, 2000; Engardio, 2001). In an analysis of the\ninventory problems recently facing the US electronics and telecoms industry, Engardio (2001)\npoints out that the \u201cboasts\u201d of flexible manufacturing and Just-in-Time supply chains have\ndisguised some of the risks involved. He projects hefty writedowns for \u201cwhomever ends up\n4stuck with the inventory hot potato\u201d. In a similar vein, Svensson (2002) stresses that JIT issues\nhave been explored in many different aspects but vulnerability issues remain largely\nunexplored. Also, an executive at a US distribution giant stresses the lack of ownership in\nhighly integrated supply chains, where \u201cthe finger pointing is likely to get faster\u201d and risks of\nproduct obsolescence, inventories and a lack of responsiveness to peaks and troughs in end\ncustomer demand become even more troublesome (Souter 2000).\nGiven the widely acknowledged vulnerabilities of todays\u2019 complex supply chains, one might\nexpect the concept to have a clear meaning and a rich tradition of empirical findings and\nmanagerial approaches. On the contrary, a close examination of the literature reveals that only\nrecently can a more systematic and structured approach to conceptualise vulnerabilities and\nsupply chain risks be traced (e.g. Harland and Brenchley, 2001; Norrman and Lindroth, 2002;\nSvensson 2000 and 2002; Sheffi, 2002; Johnson, 2001; Zsidisin et. al., 2000). This article\nseeks to further that interest by providing a framework and foundation for systematically\nexploring the concept of risk management in supply chains. The purpose of this paper is to\ndelineate the domain of risk management in supply chains, to provide an operational\ndefinition and to outline an agenda directing future research. We draw on the literature in risk\nmanagement and supply chain management and compare, contrast and supplement it with the\npreliminary analysis of empirical findings from exploratory semi-structured field interviews.\nRESEARCH METHODOLOGY\nIn order to tap the \u201cmental\u201d maps and experiences of supply chain professionals, a discovery-\noriented, practitioner-based approach was applied, with semi-structured interviews being the\nprimary method of data collection (Zaltman et al., 1982; Yin, 1989). In addition, because the\n5purpose of the study was theory construction (i.e. eliciting constructs and research issues), it\nwas important to capture a wide range of experiences and perspectives in the course of the\ndata collection. Therefore, a purposive or \u201ctheoretical\u201d sampling plan (Glaser and Strauss,\n1967) was used to ensure that the sample included managers with responsibilities in supply\nchain management and risk management in industrial, consumer and service industries (see\nTable 1).\nTable 1: Industry sectors represented in the field research\nManufacturing Companies Retail Companies Logistics Service Provider\n\uf0a7 Aerospace\n\uf0a7 Automotive\n\uf0a7 Brewing\n\uf0a7 Building Supplies (SME)\n\uf0a7 Capital Equipment\n\uf0a7 Cosmetics\n\uf0a7 Groceries (packaged\nfoods)\n\uf0a7 Cleaning Products\n(household)\n\uf0a7 Healthcare\n\uf0a7 Packaging\n(pharmaceutical)\n\uf0a7 Tabacco\n\uf0a7 Grocery\n\uf0a7 Apparel\n\uf0a7 Cosmetics\n\uf0a7 Seasonal Gifts\n\uf0a7 Management Consultancy\n\uf0a7 Freight Forwarding\n\uf0a7 Shipping\n\uf0a7 Third Party Logistics\nTo maintain a level of consistency between interviewees and researchers, an outline protocol\nwas developed. However, given the overall paucity of literature directly addressing supply\nchain vulnerability and risk management, care was taken not to be too prescriptive. The\nquestions and issues were to be treated only as discussion starters. The interviews typically\nlasted one to one and a half hours and were, where possible, conducted at the interviewees\u2019\npremises. These interviews were supplemented by focus groups held at Cranfield University\nas part of a Supply Chain Vulnerability Conference held in April 2002. This tended to result\nin better overall quality of discussions and enabled some supporting documentary evidence to\n6be collected. In most cases the primary contact would be a senior logistics\/supply chain\nmanager. Managers with responsibility for business continuity and risk management,\nprocurement, or IT were amongst those who also attended. Interviews were tape recorded with\nthe informants\u2019 prior agreement, then transcribed and summarised for analysis using thematic\ncoding. Cross-case analysis elicited the overarching factors of interest and drew together the\nemerging themes in supply chain risk management (Miles and Huberman, 1994).\nSUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT: THE CONCEPT AND ITS BASIC\nCONSTRUCTS\nIn defining the concept of supply chain risk management, we suggest that it is relevant to\ndistinguish four basic constructs: supply chain risk sources, risk consequences, risk drivers\nand risk mitigating strategies. These constructs help us not only to probe the concept, but\nprovide a basis for synthesising the emergent themes and issues for future research.\nSupply Chain Risk Sources and Risk Consequences\nIn the popular, practitioner-oriented risk management literature (eg. Goldberg et al., 1999), as\nwell as among our managers interviewed, the uses of the term \u2018risk\u2019 can be confusing because\nit is perceived as a multidimensional construct (Zsidisin forthcoming). On the one hand, it is\nused to refer to uncertain internal or external, environmental variables that reduce outcome\npredictability. In this sense, \u2018risk\u2019 actually refers to a source of risk and uncertainty, such as\n\u2018political risks\u2019 and \u2018market risks\u2019 or, from a supply chain view, \u2018the volatility of customer\ndemand\u2019. On the other hand, the term risk is also used when referring to the consequences of\n7risks, ie to the potential outcome indicators. In this sense, the terms \u2018operational risks\u2019,\n\u2018human risks\u2019 or \u2018risks to customer service levels\u2019 are consequences of risks becoming events.\nIn defining the concept of supply chain risk management, we suggest to adopt the definition\nprovided by March and Shapira (1987) and define \u2018risk\u2019 as \u201cthe variation in the distribution of\npossible supply chain outcomes, their likelihood, and their subjective values\u201d (p. 1404). From\nour supply chain perspective, these uncertain variations or disruptions affect the flows of\ninformation, materials or products across organisation borders (LaLonde, 1997). For the\npurpose of our research, supply chain risks hence comprise \u201cany risks for the information,\nmaterial and product flows from original supplier to the delivery of the final product for the\nend user.\u201d In simple terms, supply chain risks refer to the possibility and effect of a mismatch\nbetween supply and demand. \u2018Risk sources\u2019 are the environmental, organisational or supply\nchain-related variables which cannot be predicted with certainty and which impact on the\nsupply chain outcome variables. Risk consequences are the focused supply chain outcome\nvariables like e.g. costs or quality, ie the different forms in which the variance becomes\nmanifest.\nSupply Chain Risk Drivers and Risk Mitigating Strategies\nAmong practitioners, risk taking is generally perceived as an integrated and inevitable part of\nmanagement (March and Shapira, 1987). In their view, risk taking equals decision making\nunder uncertainty and hence any strategic choice has certain risk implications. For supply\nchain contexts, Braithwaite and Hall (1999) emphasise that the relationship between corporate\nstrategy, risk and the implications for supply chain management are poorly understood and in\nneed of further exploration.\n8(-)\n(+)\n(1) Risk Sources\n(3) Supply Chain\nRisk Drivers\n(4) Supply Chain Risk\nMitigating Strategies\n(2) Adverse Supply\nChain Risk\nConsequences\nIn defining the concept of supply chain risk management, we make a distinction between\nsupply chain risk drivers and risk mitigating strategies.\nSeveral writers propose that some of the influences on contemporary supply chain\nmanagement in the last decade, such as for example the globalisation of supply chains or the\ntrend towards outsourcing, have exacerbated the risk exposure as well as the impact of any\nsupply chain disruption (Christopher and Lee, 2001; McGillivray, 2000; Engardio, 2001).\nSince competitive pressures are often the drivers of risk, Svensson (2002) uses the term\n\u201ccalculated risks\u201d (p. 119) that a company takes in order to improve competitiveness, reduce\ncosts, and increase or maintain profitability. Risk mitigating strategies on the other hand are\nthose strategic moves organisations deliberately undertake to mitigate the uncertainties\nidentified from the various risk sources (Miller, 1992). The four, interrelated basic constructs\nof supply chain risk management are summarised in the following figure.\nFigure 1: Supply chain risk management - the basic constructs\n9From this structure, the terms supply chain vulnerability and supply chain risk management\ncan be derived: Supply chain vulnerability is \u201cthe propensity of risk sources and risk drivers to\noutweigh risk mitigating strategies, thus causing adverse supply chain consequences\u201d.\nWhereas from a single firm perspective, the adverse consequences affect a firm\u2019s goal\naccomplishment (Svensson, 2002, p. 112), in a supply chain context, they jeopardise the\nsupply chain\u2019s ability to effectively serve the end customer market. Supply chain risk\nmanagement aims to identify the potential sources of risk and implement appropriate actions\nto avoid or contain supply chain vulnerability. Consequently, it can be defined as: \u201cthe\nidentification and management of risks for the supply chain, through a co-ordinated approach\namongst supply chain members, to reduce supply chain vulnerability as a whole.\u201d\nA FRAMEWORK DIRECTING FUTURE RESEARCH IN SUPPLY CHAIN RISK\nMANAGEMENT\nThe four basic constructs of the supply chain risk management concept enable us to identify\nthe related critical aspects of the managerial concept: (1) Assessing the risk sources for the\nsupply chain; (2) identifying the risk concept of the supply chain by defining the most relevant\nrisk consequences (3) tracking the risk drivers in the supply chain strategy and (4) mitigating\nrisks in the supply chain. Whereas these critical aspects could be taken as sequential steps in a\nmanagerial process, we acknowledge the embryonic stage of the field and put them forward as\na structure guiding future research. Hence, we will now proceed by structuring our literature\n10\nreview and field findings along these basic dimensions, outlining the positive and normative\nresearch issues related to them.\n(1) Assessing the Risk Sources for the Supply Chain\nIn the literature, various ways of categorising sources of risk coexist (e.g. Miller, 1992;\nGoldberg et al., 1999). The classification clarifies the relevant dimensions of potential\ndisruptions faced by organisations in supply chains and provides the basis for risk assessment.\nBased on the literature review and fieldwork findings, we suggest that supply-chain relevant\nrisk sources fall into three categories: Environmental risk sources, network-related risk\nsources and organisational risk sources (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2: Risk sources in supply chains\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\nNetwork Risk Sources\nEnvironmental Risk Sources\nOrganisational Risk Sources\n11\nEnvironmental risk sources comprise any uncertainties arising from the supply chain-\nenvironment interaction. These may be the result of accidents (e.g. fire), socio-political\nactions (e.g. fuel protests or terrorist attacks) or acts of God (e.g. extreme weather or\nearthquakes). Organisational risk sources lie within the boundaries of the supply chain parties\nand range from labour (e.g. strikes) or production uncertainties (e.g. machine failure) to IT-\nsystem uncertainties. Network-related risk sources as the third category arise from interactions\nbetween organisations within the supply chain. Whatever damage is caused by suboptimal\ninteraction between the organisations along the chain is attributable to network-related risk\nsources. In this sense, environmental and organisational uncertainties are risk sources \u2018to\u2019 the\nvarious links in the supply chain and network-related uncertainties are risk sources \u2018of\u2019 the\nvarious links (Das and Teng, 1998). We distinguish between three different types of network-\nrelated risk sources: lack of ownership, chaos and inertia (Christopher and Lee, 2001):\nLack of ownership\nLack of ownership risk sources in supply chains result from blurring boundaries between\nbuying and supplying companies in the chain. Triggered by trends such as outsourcing and\nconcentration on core competencies, the increased use of manufacturing, distribution and\nlogistics partners leads to a complex network of business relationships with confused lines of\nresponsibilities. The risks often result in inventory costs due to product obsolescence,\nmarkdowns or stock-outs, which are passed on among the organisations in the supply chain.\n12\nChaos\nThe complexity forces of a supply chain can drive \u2018chaos effects\u2019 in supply chains. These\nchaos effects result from over-reactions, unnecessary interventions, second-guessing, mistrust,\ndistorted information throughout a supply chain or simply from a lack of supply chain\nunderstanding amongst its organisations. The well-known bullwhip effect, which describes\nincreasing fluctuations of order patterns from downstream to upstream supply chains, is an\nexample of such chaos (Lee et al., 1997).\nInertia\nFinally, the supply chain is exposed to inertia risks, i.e. a general lack of responsiveness to\nchanging environmental conditions and market signals. Especially in global supply chains\nflexibility is often sacrificed for cost reduction. Consequences can be the inability to react to\ncompetitor moves, shifting customer demand or to any other unpredicted event arising from\nenvironmental or organisational risk sources.\nNetwork-related risk sources form an integrated part of the network design and structure and\ncan either absorb or amplify the impact of events arising from environmental or organisational\nrisk sources. Similarly, as the construction of a building is decisive in terms of the disruptive\nimpact of an earthquake, the network structure of a supply chain influences the supply chain\neffect of events arising for example from environmental risk sources.\nIn the literature as well as among our interviewees, it has been emphasised that implementing\na supply chain-wide risk assessment is a complex and difficult task. Gilbert and Gips (2000)\nstress that while it may be feasible to assess risks at a supplier\u2019s supplier, it gets less practical\n13\nand more expensive to analyse the exposure of a supplier of a supplier\u2019s supplier. Knowing\nwhere to stop may be difficult. Still, it is known that risk perception shapes the decision\nmakers\u2019 risk behaviour (Sitkin and Weingart, 1995) and blank spots on the map of potential\nrisk sources increase the supply chain\u2019s vulnerability. Similarly, there was a consensus in the\ninterviews that network-related risks are an important and so far neglected source of risk.\nEspecially in the light of the increasing complexity of today\u2019s supply networks, interviewees\nfelt that the visibility and control appears to be thinning beyond the next tier of related\norganisations. Network-related risk sources, however, cannot be dealt with through \u2018tried and\ntrusted\u2019 risk assessment tools. Instead, identifying network-risks requires a thorough\nunderstanding of the supply network\u2019s structure, flows, operational dynamics and\ncomplexities. Traditional tools like supply chain mapping or critical path analysis (e.g. Scott\nand Westbrook, 1991) have to be developed further in order to become effective tools\nsupporting the network risk assessment. It appeared that most of the companies tended to\ndefine and manage their supply chains by product or channel type, reflecting a view of supply\nchains being a series of vertically integrated linear processes that converge or diverge at a\nsingle given point. This view overlooks much of the complexity of the network and\nhorizontal interactions between the product-focused supply chains.\nTo summarise, the findings from the literature review as well as our interviews indicate two\nissues to be addressed by future research: first, understanding risk assessment along the chain\nand developing more practicable approaches to guide the process and second, investigating\nrisk implications of different network structures and developing effective tools for identifying\nnetwork-related risks.\n14\n(2) Defining the Supply Chain Risk Concept and Adverse Risk Consequences\nAdverse risk consequences can become manifest in any outcome measure and the literature\nprovides extensive lists, ranging from financial consequences through reputation damage to\nhealth and safety concerns (e.g. Goldberg et al., 1999; Harland and Brenchley, 2001). The\nconsequences focused in a specific supply chain context form the managers\u2019 supply chain\n\u2018risk concept\u2019. Our findings from exploratory discussions provide tentative evidence that\nsystematic differences in the risk concepts could be dependent on the specific supply chain\nand\/or industry context (see also Pablo, 1999). In addition, the prominent risk concept of\nmanagers appears to impact on the approach they apply to manage risks. The outcome\nvariables focused on ranged from commercial (eg. risks associated with stockouts or high\nlevels of inventory) to risk to life and\/or political ramifications.\nAt one end of the spectrum were acutely commercially focused fast moving consumer goods\ncompanies, particularly those selling through conventional retail channels. For these\norganisations, the need to be price competitive makes operational efficiency a constant\npressure. These organisatons were continually seeking to lower inventories as a means to\nbecome more responsive and demand-driven, but the competitive and commercial risk\nconsequences like lost sales due to non-availability were serious concerns. Interestingly, the\nmanagers of consumer good companies also appeared to be relatively insensitive to incidents\nwith very low probabilities but potentially catastrophic outcome. In their supply chain risk\nmanagement approach, they seem to concentrate on \u201catomistic\u201d risk sources (Svensson,\n15\n2000), ie disruptions caused by the direct supplier and\/or customer (e.g. a direct supplier going\nbankrupt) with minor or moderate consequences. Some of these organisations were even\nreluctant to use the term risk when referring to their situation. Closer to the other end of the\nspectrum of potential risk concepts were the supplier of critical health products and an\naerospace company. Quality was a critical concern for both. The attitude of the latter towards\nsupply chain risk management was deeply rooted in its engineering heritage and the\nphilosophy of Total Quality Management, together with a vivid awareness of the worse case\nconsequences of failure. This overriding awareness is also reflected in the responsibility for\nrisk management, which formally lies with the company board, although in practice the scope\nof risk management tends to be narrow and to be confined to a compliance with the minimum\nstatutory requirements. Supply chain wide risk management on the other hand is not yet\nrecognised as a key element in business continuity planning.\nThese findings from the field research bear some correspondance with a classification of risk\ntypes proposed by Norrman and Lindroth (2002). They suggest a distinction be made between\noperational accidents, operational catastrophes and strategic uncertainties, based on\nprobability and severity of the risk consequences. Moreover, looking at the literature we find\nthat the approaches put forward for risk management can also be categorised along those\nfocused risk consequences. On the one hand, a number of contributions can be traced which\nlook primarily at operational accidents, which \u2013 if not planned for \u2013 can turn into operational\ncatastrophes. The main emphasis within this body of literature is on risk assessment, business\ncontinuity planning and crises management (e.g. Ericson, 2001; Hellweg, 2002; Hoffman,\n1998; Zsidisin et. al., 2000). On the other hand, an emerging stream of works looks at the\n16\nstrategic uncertainties such as e.g. future investments into relationship specific resources (e.g.\nDas and Teng, 1998; Smith and Zsidisin, 2002), the risk implications of new supply network\nconfigurations (e.g. Hall, 1999) or supply chain capacity investments (e.g. Norrman and\nLindroth, 2002). Here, a main managerial implication appears to be the reduction of\nuncertainty associated with these strategic decisions, rather than minimising its detrimental\nimpact through e.g. continuity planning.\nIn summary, our findings provide tentative evidence that the risk concept of organisations\nimpacts on the \u2018scope\u2019 of supply chain risk management and the approach practitioners apply\nto manage risks. A research opportunity from this finding is to investigate risk management in\ndifferent supply chains and\/or industries and apply a contingency perspective. From a\ncontingency perspective, research attention lies on exploring which risk concept is relevant in\nparticular industries to particular supply chains (Baird and Thomas, 1990). Instead of trying to\nassume a kind of average overall picture, the view of supply chain and industry-specific risk\nconcepts appears to be more promising in aiding managers to assess and manage risks in their\nsupply chains.\n(3) Identifying the Risk Drivers of the Supply Chain Strategy\nWhilst risk has always been present in the process of reconciling supply with demand, there\nare a number of factors that have emerged in the last decade or so which might be considered\nto have increased the level of risk. These include: (1) a focus on efficiency rather than\n17\neffectiveness; (2) the globalisation of supply chains; (3) focussed factories and centralised\ndistribution; (4) the trend to outsourcing and (5) the reduction of the supplier base. All these\nrisk drivers are changes to the structure of modern supply chains and impact directly on\nnetwork-related risk sources. Through the trends of globalisation and outsourcing, the\ncomplexity of supply chain structures increases. Rather than a neat sequence of value-adding\nstages, dynamic network shapes become the reality (Braithwaite and Hall, 1999). The supply\nnetwork structure describes lateral and horizontal inter-linkages, reverse loops or two-way\nexchanges encompassing the upstream and downstream activities within and among the\nsupply chain organisations (Lamming et al., 2000). A supply network brings with it risks from\nall related network sources, namely uncertainties due to lack of ownership, chaos and inertia\n(Christopher and Lee, 2001). Some of the other risk drivers like e.g. the reduction of the\nsupplier base and the trend towards efficiency rather than effectiveness lead to more integrated\nsupply chains. This too, increases the likelihood of disruptions caused by suboptimal\ninteraction between the supply chain organisations primarily through lack of ownership in\nhighly integrated supply chain processes.\nMost of the supply chain managers taking part in the research were aware of the risk drivers\nembedded in their supply chain strategies. Many of the supply chain disruptions reported,\nwere clearly caused by these drivers or at least exacerbated by them. Examples include the\ndetrimental effects of a fire in a centralised warehouse, the bankruptcy of the sole supplier of a\nkey component or a critical system failure, which was compounded by the company\u2019s prior\nmove into a 3rd party environment. Still, whilst the drivers are recognised as competitive\npressures with risk implications, it appears that the implications are often sorted out on an ad\n18\nhoc basis as organisations \u2018go along\u2019. What seems to be missing is a more proactive approach\nwhere risk implications are anticipated at an earlier stage. This is amplified by often split\nresponsibilities for supply chain and risk management. In one organisation, we interviewed\njointly the supply chain manager and the risk manager. It was striking how for the first half of\nthe interview the supply chain manager elaborated on the company\u2019s achievements in\nrestructuring the supply chain over the last years to make it more effective. He concluded by\nstating that it might now be time to scrutinise the robustness of the optimised supply network.\nFrom there on, the risk manager took over and explained about the \u2018near misses\u2019 and risk\nexposures of the company. At the end of the interview, both confirmed how mutually\nbeneficial the discussion had been and how vital a closer cooperation between supply chain\nand risk management was. Similarly, in another company, the risk manager responsible for\nauditing the supply chain partners\u2019 risk exposure and preparedness, critisised his lack of\ninfluence over strategic purchasing decisions.\nTo summarise, furthering our understanding on the role of risk in supply chain strategy\ndevelopment and implementation processes is an important research issue. Strategic choices\nand design decisions may build specific vulnerabilities into a supply chain. Thus, processes\nand tools need to be developed helping managers to anticipate and track not only the benefits\nbut also the attendant risks for their supply chains.\n(4) Mitigating Risks for the Supply Chain\n19\nFrom a single organisation view, Miller (1992) distinguishes five generic strategies companies\nundertake in order to mitigate risk, four of which can be adapted to supply chain contexts: (1)\navoidance, (2) control, (3) cooperation and (4) flexibility. The following table summarises\nexamples of these mitigating strategies applied among our organisations interviewed:\nTable 2: Risk mitigating strategies in supply chains\nAvoidance \uf0b7 Dropping specific products\/geographical markets\/supplier and\/or\ncustomer organisations\nControl \uf0b7 Vertical integration\n\uf0b7 Increased stockpiling and the use of buffer inventory\n\uf0b7 Maintaining excess capacity in productions, storage, handling\nand\/or transport\n\uf0b7 Imposing contractual obligations on suppliers\nCooperation \uf0b7 Joint efforts to improve supply chain visibility and understanding\n\uf0b7 Joint efforts to share risk-related information\n\uf0b7 Joint efforts to prepare supply chain continuity plans\nFlexibility \uf0b7 Postponement\n\uf0b7 Multiple sourcing\n\uf0b7 Localised sourcing\nAvoidance\nAvoidance occurs when risks associated with operating in a given product market or\ngeographical area are considered to be unacceptable (Miller, 1992, p. 322). From a supply\nchain perspective, avoidance can be related to products\/geographical markets and\/or supplier\nand customer organisations. A company could drop specific products, suppliers or\ngeographical markets if supply is seen to be unreliable.\nControl\nCompanies may seek to control contingencies from the various risk sources, rather than\npassively treat uncertainties as constraints within which they must operate (Miller, 1992, p.\n20\n323). Not surprisingly, control strategies were most widespread amongst the organisations\ninterviewed. Examples in supply chains include vertical integration, increased stockpiling and\nthe use of buffer inventory or maintaining excess capacity in production, storage, handling\nand\/or transport or finally, imposing contractual requirements on suppliers.\nCooperation\nCompared with control initiatives, cooperative responses involve joint agreements, rather than\nunilateral control, as a means of achieving uncertainty reduction (Miller, 1992, p. 323). From\na supply chain perspective, the focus is on joint agreements among organisations in the supply\nchain to improve supply chain visibility and understanding, to share information on exposures\nto specific risk sources and finally, to prepare joint business continuity plans. Whereas\ncooperative risk mitigation strategies were applied by many of the organisations interviewed,\nit is mainly restricted to initiatives with key suppliers.\nFlexibility\nUnlike the strategic moves of control, which attempt to increase the predictability of\ncontingencies from the various risk sources, flexibility increases responsiveness while leaving\nthe predictability of factors unchanged (Miller, 1992, p. 324). One supply chain example is\npostponement, where companies delay the decision to make, configure, label or ship a product\nto a particular destination. Postponement reduces their dependence on forecasts and increases\nthe ability to respond to variablity or even disruptions in demand. A second supply chain\nexample is multiple sourcing, which one manager classified as the traditional form of\n21\nmanaging risk through spreading risk. Finally, a third supply chain example is localised\nsourcing with its short lead-times and potential for quick responses.\nOur literature review and fieldwork findings suggest that risk mitigating strategies in supply\nchains have to be investigated in conjunction with the risk drivers. Together, they build on\nseveral supply chain trade-off decisions summarised by Sheffi (2002) (1) Repeatability versus\nunpredictability, ie trading the benefits of repeatable processes against the cost of a lack of\nflexibility; (2) the lowest bidder versus the known supplier; (3) centralisation versus\ndispersion decisions in production and distribution; (4) collaboration versus secrecy, ie while\nsharing more information on e.g. the results of risk audits would better place organisations to\nmanage supply chain risks, it could also deter potential customers or weaken the bargaining\nposition; (5) redundancy versus efficiency, ie managing the conflict between excess capacity\nin a supply chain and the efficiency-focused lean paradigm aiming at the elimination or\nreduction of waste. A final, maybe paramount supply chain trade-off decision is between\n\u2018managing risk and delivering value\u2019. This is the trade-off between the extra costs related to\nmost of the mitigating strategies and the total costs of supply as a main principle of\ncontemporary supply chain management.\nHandling trade-off decisions was a highly relevant issue for the managers interviewed. In the\nliterature, some authors are suggesting strategies that are designed specifically to balance\nsome of the trade-off decisions. For example, Sheffi (2002) suggests holding strategic\nemergency stocks to be used only in the case of extreme disruptions. In addition, he suggests\ndual sourcing as a strategy where offshore suppliers are used for the bulk of the procurement\n22\nvolume and local suppliers in the case of disruptions. Whereas both strategies are very\nplausible, our interviews have pointed at some difficulties in implementing them. For strategic\nemergency stocks, deciding whether or not components or products are critical is often easier\nsaid than done. Many organisations seem to use a value-added calculation as the basic criteria.\nYet a brewery was hit in the fuel crisis because it ran out of cheap but bulky packaging\ncardboard trays, where maintaining more than 24 hours emergency stock was deemed\nunnecessary. Similarly, implementing a dual sourcing strategy, where typically local suppliers\nare given only a fraction of the business, can be difficult. One company reported an incident\nwhere their local supplier, who only accounted for 5% of the organisation\u2019s business, ceased\nto supply when he was swamped with orders from its main, prioritised customer.\nTo summarise, we suggest that further research should investigate these trade-offs and\ndevelop tools supporting managers in their supply chain and situation-specific decision-\nmaking processes.\nCONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH\nBased upon a synthesis between our conceptualisation of supply chain risk management and\nthe views of practitioners, four critical aspects of the management concept were identified: (1)\nAssessing the risks sources for the supply chain; (2) defining the supply chain risk concept\nand adverse consequences; (3) identifying the risk drivers in the supply chain strategy and (4)\nmitigating risks for the supply chain. There now follows a summary of our findings on each of\n23\nthese aspects by distinguishing between positive as well as normative future research issues.\nThe following table summarises the future research issues under each of the critical aspects.\nTable 3: An agenda for future research in supply chain risk management\nPositive Research Issues Normative Research Issues\n(1) Assessing the risks sources for the supply chain\nUnderstanding risk assessment processes\nwithin supply networks and the risk\nimplications of different network structures.\nDeveloping more practical approaches to\nguide the risk assessment process in supply\nnetworks.\n(2) Defining the risk concept and adverse consequences\nInvestigating risk concepts in different supply\nchains and\/or industries from a contingency\nperspective.\nDeveloping risk management approaches for\nspecific supply chains and\/or industries.\n(3) Identifying the risk drivers of the supply chain strategy\nFurthering our understanding on the role of\nrisk in supply chain strategy development and\nimplementation processes.\nDeveloping approaches helping managers to\ntrack the vulnerabilities of their supply chain\nstrategies.\n(4) Mitigating risks for the supply chain\nInvestigating how risk performance trade-offs\nare managed in the supply chain.\nDeveloping processes guiding supply chain\ntrade-off decision making.\nPositive research adopts the perspective of attempting to describe, explain, predict and\nunderstand the supply chain risk management activities that are currently practiced and hence,\n24\nactually exist. Suitable methodologies comprise qualitative methods like in-depth interviews\nand case studies, but also quantitative surveys. In contrast, normative research attempts to\nprescribe what organisations and individuals ought to do with regard to supply chain risk\nmanagement (Hunt, 1991). Our analysis showed that more positive research is needed in order\nto fully understand the complexity of supply chain risk management before practicable\nmanagerial guidelines and frameworks can be developed. Hence, what is needed is more\nempirically grounded research on supply chain risk management.\nCurrent awareness of supply chain risk management has been raised over recent years by a\nsuccession of disruptive events affecting the international and UK business environment.\nWhereas these incidents have highlighted the importance of robust supply netwoks for\nindividual organisations and whole industry sectors, they prompt us to suggest \u2018quick fix\u2019\nsolutions in a firefighting mode. Individuals and organisations might have a strong temptation\nto return to normality after major crises, but we believe that it is an academic responsibility to\nestablish supply chain risk management as an important, if so far neglected, area of applied\nresearch.\nReferences\nBETTIS, T. & THOMAS, H.
