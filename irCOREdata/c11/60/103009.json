In 2005 the Task Force commissioned an activity focusing on \u2018the impact of\nnutrition on inflammation\u2019. The aim of this activity was to review current knowledge focusing on common mechanisms and markers of\ninflammation, the role of inflammation in various diseases and conditions, and the potential for modulation of inflammation by nutrition.\nThe aim was addressed by establishing an Expert Group, drafting a document and holding a Workshop to discuss the draft document and\nto finalise the conclusions. The finalised document will be published.\nThe Workshop was held in 2006 and gathered together clinicians, immunologists, pharmacologists and nutritionists in order to consider:\n(a) the role of inflammation in a range of distinct pathological conditions (inflammatory bowel diseases, coeliac disease, asthma, chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disorder, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, obesity) including the identification of\ncommon and unique molecular and cellular responses and signalling pathway; (b) the mechanism of action of common anti-inflammatory\ndrugs; (c) the potential pro- and anti-inflammatory roles of specific dietary components (PUFA, vitamins C and E, carotenoids, flavonoids,\nprebiotics, probiotics).\nA number of conclusions were reached. Inflammation is a normal part of the host immune response to infection and to other insults; it\ninitiates pathogen killing as well as tissue repair processes and helps to restore homeostasis at infected or damaged sites. Normally, the\nhost is tolerant to microbes and other environmental components that do not pose a threat. This tolerance involves only a limited host\nresponse or an active response that is tightly controlled. Where an inflammatory response does occur it is normally well regulated in order\nthat it does not cause excessive damage to the host, is self-limiting and resolves rapidly. Pathological inflammation involves a loss of\ntolerance and\/or of regulatory processes, although the reasons for this loss are not clear. Whatever the site of inflammation or the nature of\nthe trigger, common mediators of inflammation include certain cytokines (TNFa, IL-1b, IL-6, interferon-g), chemokines (IL-8, monocyte\nchemoattractant peptide-1), eicosanoids (PGE2, 4-series leukotrienes), matrix metalloproteases and reactive oxygen species, and signalling\npathways often involve the activation of NF-kB. Several nutritional strategies, including n-3 PUFA, antioxidants vitamins, plant flavo-\nnoids, prebiotics and probiotics may be able to amelioriate chronic inflammatory processes. However, nutritional studies rely heavily on\ncell culture and animal models, and more studies in human subjects are needed. Although nutritional studies have focused on therapy of\ninflammatory conditions, appropriate nutrition may lower the risk of such conditions occurring, but strong evidence of this effect is\ncurrently lacking.\nProceedings of the Nutrition Society (2008), 67 (OCE), E9 doi:10.1017\/S0029665108006186\n"}
