We \nhave no difficulty envisaging a historical period extending a certain distance back, \nand before this a much longer prehistoric period extending into the deep past.  For the \nhistorical period there is documentary evidence; but we accept that there was a \nprehistoric period, studied by prehistorians, for which there is (by definition) no \ndocumentation \u2013 material evidence is the only means by which we can examine it.  \nBut until the 19th century there was no concept of prehistory.  The origin of the \nconcept is one of the key developments in our understanding of the human past, and \nhas seen considerable discussion in the recent English and French literature.  This \ndiscussion has explored the 19th century archaeologies of the two countries, \nexamining both the concept of prehistory, and the terminology used to discuss it. \n \nTerminology is the more clear-cut.  The first use of the word \u2018prehistoric\u2019 in English \nwas not by an Englishman at all, but by the Scot Daniel Wilson, in his Archaeology \nand Prehistoric Annals of Scotland (Wilson 1851).  It is generally thought likely that \nhe invented the term himself (Daniel 1964, Chippindale 1988, Kehoe 1991, 1998, \n 2 \nTrigger 1999, Kelley 2003). Clermont and Smith (1990:98-99) however point out that \nthe French archaeologist Gustav d\u2019Eichthal however used pr\u00e9historique as early as \n1845, but add that it remains unclear whether Wilson ever came across this and \n(consciously or unconsciously) adopted it.  Pr\u00e9historien first appeared in French in \n1872, almost 20 years before \u2018prehistorian\u2019 first occurs in English (Clermont and \nSmith 1990:97).   \n \nThe concept of prehistory is less clear-cut.  In English, Daniel Wilson was probably \nthe first to demonstrate a clear grasp of it; certainly no English or Irish archaeologist \ndid so before him (Rowley-Conwy in press).  In France, Paul Tournal used ant\u00e9-\nhistorique as early as 1833 (Coye 1993, Stoczkowski 1993), but it is open to question \nwhether he understood this in the way \u2018prehistoric\u2019 is now used.  Tournal excavated \ncaves and recovered human artefacts and bones of extinct mammals in the same \nlayers, believing them to be contemporary.  This extended human antiquity further \nback into the most recent geological past, which he therefore divided into two: the \nhistoric, and the ant\u00e9-historique (Grayson 1983:101-102, Coye 1993, 1997:67-70).  \nStoczkowski (1993:17) argues that this reveals a clear idea of prehistory on Tournal\u2019s \npart; but Groenen (1994:45) argues that since Tournal never analyzed the implications \nof his discovery, he cannot be considered the originator of the concept.  Chippindale \n(1988:307) mentions an English use of \u2018ante-historic\u2019 by H.N. Coleridge in 1834, but \nin a discussion of classical Greek poetry.  Its first English use in an archaeological \ncontext may have been in 1849 by the Irishman Sir William Wilde, father of the \nplaywright Oscar Wilde, in his description of the antiquities of the Boyne Valley \n(Wilde 1849:6); Sir William did not however have a clear concept of prehistory \n(Rowley-Conwy in press). \n \nThe purpose of this contribution is to argue that the Anglo-French focus of the recent \ndiscussion has been misplaced.  The Danish word for \u2018prehistoric\u2019 was first published \nin 1834, over a decade before even d\u2019Eichthal\u2019s monograph.  This has passed almost \nentirely unnoticed in the recent Anglo-French literature; the only exceptions appear to \nbe Chippindale, who identifies a Danish mention in 1837, but he states that the term \ndid not enter the technical language until 30 years later, after its general adoption in \nEnglish and French (Chippindale 1988:310); and Welinder, who in a short \ncommentary on Chippindale\u2019s article mentions a few Swedish uses in subsequent \nyears (Welinder 1991).  This contribution will however show that the Danish and \nSwedish words were used well over 100 times up to 1850 (table 1).  It will also show \nthat the concept was well developed by 1836 \u2013 though not pioneered by the man who \ninvented the word \u2013 and that it became a central aspect of the nationalist debate of the \nlater 1840s.  Finally, it will show that Daniel Wilson probably picked up the word and \nthe concept from this Scandinavian tradition \u2013 not from a French antecedent.  In \nexploring these strands of the history of archaeology, the paper will focus relatively \nnarrowly on the intellectual origins and development of the concept of prehistory and \n\u2018prehistoric\u2019 in Scandinavia and Scotland; it will not examine the broader political or \ncontextual aspects except insofar as these are necessary for the pursuance of this \nprimary aim.  Nor will it stray from the geographical limits laid down \u2013 the \nelucidation of the situation in other countries and other intellectual traditions is left to \nthose more conversant with them than is the present author. \n \n \nTHE 1830s: THOMSEN AND MOLBECH \n 3 \n \nThe Danish and Norwegian word cognate to \u2018prehistoric\u2019 is forhistorisk; in Swedish it \nis f\u00f6rhistorisk.  The Danish historian and philologist Christian Molbech (1783-1857) \n(fig. 1) delivered a series of lectures in 1833, of which he published two extracts as \nseparate articles (1834, 1836a).  Forhistorisk appears in both articles, so it appears \nlikely that Molbech first used the word in his 1833 lectures.  However, like his \ncontemporary Tournal but for very different reasons, Molbech did not have a fully \nmodern concept of prehistory. \n \nIt is easy to assume that the early 19th century view of history was the same as our \nown, and that the absence of a concept of prehistory extending before this was simply \na failure of the imagination; but in Denmark, nothing could be further from the truth.  \nOver the previous century a deep and complex historical structure had been erected, \nculminating in the work of Peter Frederik Suhm (1728-1798).  What Suhm sought to \ndo was to extract the kernel of historical truth he believed was present in early myths \nand legends, and turn it into usable history.  While recognizing the imperfections and \nproblems, Suhm believed he could deconstruct the legendary Odin into three separate \nhistorical personages.  Odin III, a refugee from Roman expansion, had led his \nfollowers into Scandinavia in c. 70 BC; the first Odin was the leader of the original \nimmigrants, whose arrival Suhm estimated occurred some time around 1400 BC, \nbased on an annual rate of migration from the Tower of Babel calculated from the \nbiblical chronology (Suhm 1770).  Suhm regarded the time from Odin I to Odin III as \nthe \u2018dark age\u2019; the time from Odin III to c. AD 800 as the \u2018fabulous age\u2019; and \nsubsequent times as the \u2018historical age\u2019 (Suhm 1802:tables I & II).  His use of \n\u2018historical\u2019 to label the third age of course did not imply that the first two were \nprehistoric in the modern sense, because all three periods were known only through \nhistory and comparative philology.  Suhm was able to reconstruct the complete \nsequence of kings from Odin III onwards, so the fabulous age was reasonably well \ndocumented; even for the little-known dark age, \u2018*most of what we know about it \nrests on more or less historically reasonable presumptions\u2019 (Suhm 1802:1, original \nemphasis)1. \n \nSuhm\u2019s scheme was accepted until the 1830s; Molbech was its leading critic.  \nMolbech did not regard Suhm\u2019s scheme as completely invalid, simply as less reliable \nthan Suhm had envisaged.  He considered that only from AD 872 did the sources \nbecome solid enough to allow reliable history to be written (Molbech 1836a:421-2), \nand he contested the existence of Odin III (Molbech 1837:99-100).  This is the \ncontext in which he used the word forhistorisk; he did not highlight the word in any \nway or even define it, so he must have assumed that it would be instantly understood \nby his readers.  This is its first appearance:2 \n \n*It is known that among the Germanic peoples, who comprise the population \nof Northwest Europe, and who since prehistoric times were divided into two \nmain tribes, that in one of these (the German) the Anglo-Saxons, and in the \nother (the Scandinavian) the Icelanders and the Norwegians, were those who \nhad the earliest national literature; both these groups also had the earliest \nwritten history in the language of the country (Molbech 1834:421, original \nemphases). \n \n 4 \nThis appears straightforward to the modern reader \u2013 but Molbech\u2019s original \nreadership would have had a different understanding in the context of Suhm\u2019s \nchronology and terminology.  In the early 1830s the only usable sources of \ninformation about the earliest times were historical and philological, however \nproblematic.  The \u2018prehistoric\u2019 split between Germans and Scandinavians was thus \nknown from history and philology; it was part of Suhm\u2019s scenario for the original \noccupation of northwestern Europe, the split into two groups occurring when the \noriginal immigrants reached the southeastern shore of the Baltic.  Molbech was using \nforhistorisk simply to label the time before Suhm\u2019s historical era, which started in \nabout AD 800.  But there was considerable historical documentation available for this \n\u2018prehistoric\u2019 period; it was just not very reliable. \n \nA consideration of Molbech\u2019s other mentions of forhistorisk in the 1830s confirms \nthat this is what he meant.  He stated that sagas \u2018*still have too much of the poetic \nnature of the prehistoric age\u2019 about them for the history they contain to be easily \nseparable from the myths; and he praised the medieval historian Saxo Grammaticus \nfor recording the \u2018*legends and stories that reached him from the prehistoric period\u2019 \n(Molbech 1834:437, 453).  Two years later he referred to \u2018*the heroic or prehistoric \nperiod\u2019 (Molbech 1836a:443).  Although he disputed the historical existence of Odin \nIII, he nevertheless assumed that some sources carried echoes of his purported times: \n \n*Among the ancient legends of Scandinavia, in its oldest poetry and writings, \nand in its religion, we encounter a famous name known for millennia, which \nhas also acquired great historical regard and value, even though it lies beyond \ndefinite knowledge, or far back in the prehistoric period.  This name is that of \nOdin\u2026 (Molbech 1837:80). \n \nMolbech\u2019s conception was thus more \u2018protohistoric\u2019 than prehistoric in its modern \nsense.  This impression will be reinforced in the next sections when we consider his \nsubsequent writings.  The 1830s did however see the development of something \napproaching the modern concept of prehistory \u2013 put forward not by Molbech, but by \nC.J. Thomsen, the acclaimed originator of the \u2018three age system\u2019 of Stone Age, \nBronze Age, and Iron Age.  Thomsen was not a man who rushed precipitately into \nprint; he had worked out his archaeological sequence getting on for two decades \nbefore his chapter appeared in the epoch-making volume Ledetraad for Nordisk \nOldkyndighed (Thomsen 1836)3.  In the 1820s, however, Thomsen rested it on \nSuhm\u2019s historical outline.  This emerges from a letter Thomsen wrote to J.G.G. \nB\u00fcsching on 19 February 1825 (printed in Hermansen 1934:101-105, translated in \nRowley-Conwy in press).  He adopted as a chronological marker the fact that \u2018*Odin \nand his hoard came to Scandinavia around the time of the birth of Christ\u2019 (Hermansen \n1934:102); Odin was said to be the bringer of metalworking to Scandinavia, but since \nmetallurgy would take some time to become established, Thomsen placed the start of \nhis Bronze Age around AD 200.  Iron appeared perhaps in the seventh or eighth \ncenturies AD (Hermansen 1934:102).  He reiterated these dates to the Swedish \nantiquarian Bror Emil Hildebrand of Lund, who visited him in 1830 (H. Hildebrand \n1880:146-147). \n \nBy 1836, this had changed.  Thomsen in his Ledetraad chapter avoided mention of \nOdin, presumably due to Molbech\u2019s criticisms, but he did consider that an \nimmigration had occurred at about the relevant time.  The crucial change was that \n 5 \nThomsen now considered that it was iron, not bronze, that had been introduced at that \ntime (Thomsen 1836:60).  This pushed the Stone and Bronze Ages further back in \ntime \u2013 just when Suhm\u2019s historical scenario was being weakened by Molbech\u2019s \nassault.  Thomsen realized both that his artefacts reached further back than the \nhistorical record, and that they provided a different kind of information: \n \n*Since these [antiquities] can never provide us with new [historical] facts, \nthey can neither confirm ancient royal successions nor fix points in time; but \nthey can, collectively and comparatively, give us a clearer idea of our \nancestors' religion, culture, way of life and so on, than the written sources; the \nlatter can never be ascribed so great an antiquity, the ancient stories are mixed \nwith more recent additions, and because they were first written down at a later \ndate must often be suspected of having been considerably distorted.  \nArchaeological remains, which cannot be described as true written sources, \nthus supplement them in broadening the limits of our knowledge of a time for \nwhich the texts are just beginning to earn our trust, and to suggest or disprove \nideas about the movements of peoples or connections concerning which \nwritten history is completely silent (Thomsen 1836:27-28). \n \nThis combination of archaeology replacing the now-discredited historical scheme as \nthe means of studying the most ancient past, and the focus of this archaeology on a \ndifferent sort of knowledge, marks the clear expression of Thomsen\u2019s concept of \nprehistory.  Thomsen however did not use the word forhistorisk, but the more general \noldtid.  This word does not (contra Daniel 1964:9) mean \u2018prehistory\u2019, but is less \nspecific, signifying something more like \u2018ancient times\u2019.  Over the last century it has \nextended its meaning as prehistory has deepened, but in the nineteenth century it \ncovered the Viking and earlier medieval periods as well as the preceding epochs.  \nSwedish does not use oldtid but has the corresponding forntid. \n \nWas the word forhistorisk in use before 1834?  It is impossible to prove categorically \nthat it was not, but two things support Molbech\u2019s 1834 usage as the original.  The first \nis that Molbech, who was a philologist as well as a historian, produced a two-volume \nDanish dictionary in 1833 \u2013 and forhistorisk does not appear in it (Molbech 1833).  \nThis suggests that Molbech coined the word for the lectures he gave the year the \ndictionary was published.  Second, Scandinavian histories produced in the years \nbefore 1834 do not use forhistorisk either.  The 1820s was a poor decade for Danish \nhistory writing (J\u00f8rgensen 1943); Vedel Simonsen\u2019s book of the preceding decade \ncontains the first mentions of the Danish terms for the Stone, Copper and Iron Ages in \na footnote (Vedel Simonsen 1813, I(2):76n1), but not forhistorisk.  There was a lot \nmore historical and archaeological writing going on in Sweden in the 1820s, but the \nauthors consulted did not apparently use f\u00f6rhistorisk.  This is true of the papers in the \nten volumes of the antiquarian periodical Iduna, published between 1811 and 1824.  \nMagnus Bruzelius did in one paper make the second mention of the Stone Age (M. \nBruzelius 1822: 305), stating a few pages later that this was \u2018*a time for which history \ndoes not provide us with the slightest illumination\u2019 (M. Bruzelius 1822: 311).  On this \nbasis B. Hildebrand (1937: 321) states that Bruzelius had a clear concept of \nprehistory, even though he did not coin a term for it.  However, Bruzelius\u2019 chronology \nwas so short that this is most doubtful; he regarded bronze artefacts as dating to no \nearlier than AD 800 (M. Bruzelius 1817: 197).  In a major book published in 1830, \nBruzelius explicitly espoused the Odinian historical model and chronology (M. \n 6 \nBruzelius 1830:15-16), as did two other Swedish historians writing at the same time \n(Fryxell 1826:7-8; Geijer 1832:31-36).  Three specifically archaeological books in \nSwedish that appeared between 1815 and 1830 (Liljegren and Brunius 1823; Sj\u00f6borg \n1815, 1822-30), as well as one in Norwegian (Kl\u00fcwer 1823), made no mention of \nf\u00f6rhistorisk.  While this is not an exhaustive review of the literature of the period, it \ndoes appear likely that nobody clearly articulated the concept before Thomsen, or \nused the word before Molbech. \n \n \nSCIENTIFIC PREHISTORY: ESCHRICHT AND NILSSON, 1837-1847 \n \nThe first uses of forhistorisk to refer to the modern concept of prehistory were \narguably by two natural scientists, Daniel Eschricht and Sven Nilsson.  As scientists \nthey had no loyalty to the early legendary accounts, and mentioned them only to \nemphasize that they were dispensing with them.  Eschricht\u2019s paper appeared first.  He \nwas a physiologist, and the first to suggest on the basis of human crania that there had \nbeen a racial succession in ancient Europe.  He was conversant with Thomsen\u2019s \nnewly-published chronology, and examined skulls he believed to be of Stone Age and \nBronze Age date.  This far back, history provided \u2018*almost no guidance\u2019 (Eschricht \n1837:109), so the skulls were the only evidence of racial succession; round-headed \nStone Age people were succeeded by long-headed Bronze Age folk.  This remarkable \ndemonstration that the crania could yield such information led to Eschricht\u2019s use of \nforhistorisk; calling for more data, he stated that \u2018*\u2026if everyone would do their bit, \nknowledge of the country\u2019s circumstances in that prehistoric time may yet reach a \nmuch higher level of certainty than would seem possible at first glance\u2019 (Eschricht \n1837:109). \n \nNilsson was a zoologist who wrote extensively on archaeological subjects.  He \nproduced a short preliminary essay in 1835, as part of the introduction to a book on \nbirds, arguing that the users of stone tools were hunter-gatherers, not agriculturalists \n(Nilsson 1835).  This was unexpectedly influential, and rapidly appeared in annotated \ntranslations in both Danish (Molbech 1836b) and Norwegian (Christie 1836).  Nilsson \ndid not use f\u00f6rhistorisk in this, but he did espouse a long chronology, suggesting that \nstone tools might have been in use as much as 3000 years ago (Nilsson 1835:L).  This \nMolbech could not accept, stating that this date was \u2018*\u2026so circumstantial and \nunknown\u2026 that it is more appropriate for the imagination than for thought; it places \nus in the mythical rather than the historical world\u2019 (Molbech 1836b:392), which once \nagain reveals his conceptual limits. \n \nNilsson\u2019s book (Nilsson 1838-43) appeared as separate fascicles over several years \nstarting in 1838, enlarged and united in 1843 (Rowley-Conwy 2004).  This major \nwork produced a chronology of economic stages which Nilsson grafted onto \nThomsen\u2019s artefactual scheme (Rowley-Conwy in press).  It also presented the first \nSwedish use of f\u00f6rhistorisk; in his 1838 foreword Nilsson stated that his subject was \nthe original inhabitants of Scandinavia: \n \n*By the original inhabitants of Scandinavia I mean not just the first people \nwho immigrated or were originally present in the country, but all those who \nlived here throughout the time that went before history; I thus mean the \n 7 \nprehistoric people of Scandinavia, of one or several tribes (Nilsson 1838-43:i-\nii, original emphases). \n \nIn the 1843 extension to his foreword, he contrasted the two current ways of viewing \nthe prehistoric past: \n \n*Two downright contradictory views of everything concerning the \nScandinavian prehistoric period, each irreconcilable with the other, have been \nin competition.  One takes literally almost everything found in [the early \nwritten sources]; the other considers everything prehistoric as mythical, \nallegoric, or poetic; the events described\u2026 were totally imaginary\u2026.  \u2013 This \nlatter view has become more and more prevalent and is becoming generally \naccepted (Nilsson 1838-43:vii). \n \nNilsson added that his own approach did not necessarily reject conclusions derived \nfrom the early sources, but merely sought to test them using the material evidence \n(Nilsson 1838-43:vii). \n \nNot surprisingly, the possibility that all the early sources were to be tested, and \npossibly rejected, annoyed Molbech.  He was the editor of a historical journal, and \nwas consequently able to give himself space for a lengthy review article dealing with \nNilsson\u2019s book.  He sought to retain a considerable role for the early sources, and \nclearly felt that Nilsson had gone too far: \n \n*The tone in which he expresses himself about his predecessors in the \npresentation of \u2018Scandinavia\u2019s prehistoric time\u2019 is what one would normally \ncall superior; and his characterisation of the two \u2018directly opposite and \nmutually exclusive views\u2019 which in this matter \u2018have been in competition\u2019, is \nin no way correct.  The earlier, uncritical and unhistorical approach thus e.g. \nnever went so far that it\u2026 regarded the contents of [early sources] as \u2018literal\u2019.  \nNor does the current approach regard all prehistoric material as \u2018myth, \nallegory or poetry\u2019; since the author here forgets traditional history, which \nmay be the truth written as poetry, or a poetic growth germinating from a \nhistorical root, without having to be entirely or solely poetry (Molbech \n1843:618, original emphasis). \n \nNilsson replied to Molbech in a literary journal.  He rejected Molbech\u2019s call for a \nhistorical methodology.  Among all the historians of the ancient world, only Tacitus \neven mentioned a people in Europe who used stone and bone tools.  History could \nthus not deal with the original inhabitants of Scandinavia; but Nilsson knew a \ndiscipline that could: \n \n*[The original inhabitants are] a subject which lies outside all of history, and \nthe history of which, as such, is neither known nor can be known.  But if this \nview is correct, and no unprejudiced or non-partisan person could doubt it, \nthen mankind\u2019s prehistoric period must be the subject of a science other than \nhistory; and since mankind in its prehistoric period is always close to, if not \nactually in, some kind of a state of nature, the natural sciences must thus be \nthe ones most suited, if not indeed the only ones suited, to delineating and \ndescribing the developmental situation of mankind and the differences \n 8 \nbetween the various tribes in terms of type, way of life, and level of \ndevelopment etc. in the time periods under discussion (Nilsson 1844: 146, \noriginal emphases). \n \nThis interesting exchange clearly reveals the opposed viewpoints and methodologies  \nof the two men, including Nilsson\u2019s concept of prehistory.  It also reveals the way \nboth routinely used forhistorisk, albeit in somewhat different ways.  Nilsson made the \nsame arguments in several other papers in the 1840s (Nilsson 1843, 1846, 1847).  One \nof these, a paper read to a scientific meeting in Christiania (as Oslo was then known) \non 18 July 1844 but not published until three years later, has the distinction of being \napparently the first ever published to contain \u2018prehistoric\u2019 in its title: Bidrag til \nkunskapen om menniskans tillvaro och verksamhet i Skandinavian, under den \nf\u00f6rhistoriska tiden [\u2018*Contribution to the knowledge of the presence and activities of \nhumans in Scandinavia, in the prehistoric period\u2019] (Nilsson 1847). \n \nWelinder (1991) has mentioned Nilsson in this context in an article in English, but \ndespite this most of these developments remain little known in the anglophone \nliterature.  The works of Molbech and Eschricht have never been published in \nEnglish.  A considerably modified third edition of Nilsson\u2019s book was translated \nmany years later, under the auspices of Sir John Lubbock (Nilsson 1868).  Curiously, \nLubbock cut Nilsson\u2019s entire 1838-43 foreword, and this was where all his mentions \nof \u2018f\u00f6rhistorisk\u2019 were to be found.  Nilsson\u2019s 1868 preface did mention in passing that \nhis first edition had dealt with \u2018the prehistoric inhabitants of Scandinavia\u2019 (Nilsson \n1868:xlviii, original emphasis), but a translated footnote from 30 years later is \nscarcely a reliable guide to the original Swedish terminology!  Nilsson\u2019s important \nrole has thus never been properly understood. \n \n \nWORSAAE AND THE NATIONALIST DEBATE, 1846-1850 \n \nIn the mid and later 1840s forhistorisk was used in at least three ways.  Molbech \n(1844) continued to champion his \u2018protohistoric\u2019 version.  Heiberg (1843) took a \nbiblical perspective, arguing that history started with the origin of human free will \nafter the expulsion from Eden; since the Fall could not be studied empirically, it was \nconsequently \u2018*one of the prehistoric preconditions, without which no history could \ntake place\u2019 (Heiberg 1843:242).  But most importantly, the youthful J.J.A. Worsaae \n(1821-1885) (fig. 2) adopted the word and repeatedly and routinely used it in its \nmodern sense.  This has entirely escaped the notice of Anglo-French commentators, \nbecause Worsaae in the 1840s used the term only in publications that were not \ntranslated into English; thus \u2018prehistoric\u2019 does not appear in his influential 1849 \nEnglish book (Worsaae 1849c). \n \nWorsaae however used forhistorisk from 1846, and (like Nilsson) in a way that fully \naccords with the modern concept.  His chronology for most of the 1840s was however \nrather short.  As discussed above, Thomsen (1836) considered that iron appeared in \nDenmark around the time of Christ.  But Worsaae felt that if this were true, more iron \nobjects should have been discovered in pagan burial mounds; their rarity led him to \nconclude that iron was not introduced much before AD 800 (Worsaae 1841:158-161).  \nNot until the end of the 1840s did finds of Roman imports with iron artefacts \nconvince him to move the start of the Iron Age as far back as Thomsen\u2019s suggestion \n 9 \n(Worsaae 1849d).  Throughout the 1840s Worsaae was mounting a strenuous assault \non the ability of history to deal with the period before AD 800, and asserting \narchaeology\u2019s claim to this period (Rowley-Conwy in press).  The Bronze Age even \nin Worsaae\u2019s short chronology was prehistoric, as it fell before AD 800; but for deep \nprehistory beyond the reach of all hints in classical sources, he had to rely on the \nStone Age in the first millennium BC and before.  This is why he stressed the Stone \nAge so much in the debates of the later 1840s. \n \nWorsaae\u2019s position at the start of the nationalist debate is summed up in his book on \nthe antiquities of the southern Swedish province of Blekinge, and their context in \nEurope as a whole (Worsaae 1846a).  Worsaae argued that archaeological conclusions \nwere still too often fitted into historical schemes, but for the more ancient past this \nwas simply not possible because the historical sources were inadequate or absent \n(Worsaae 1846a:2-3).  Historians used to consider all antiquities to be quite late; \ndolmens were interpreted as the altars, and stone tools as the sacrificial implements, \nof people who otherwise used metals; for these earlier historians, \u2018*there was no \nquestion, nor could there be so early on, that they might be remains of an earlier or \nindeed a prehistoric people\u2019 (Worsaae 1846a:45).  Worsaae developed his argument \nwith regard to the prehistoric populations of southern Scandinavia.  Nilsson (1838-\n43:ch. 2) considered that the craniological evidence indicated that Stone Age \nScandinavians were of Finnish stock.  Molbech (1844) argued that Stone and Bronze \nAge peoples were Celts, because the stone-chambered dolmens and passage graves \nwere found in other areas of Europe that had been occupied by Celtic peoples.  \nWorsaae considered these conclusions unfounded.  Opposing Nilsson, he pointed out \nthat there were no dolmens in the areas now occupied by Finns, and in any case a \nnomadic people would never have constructed anything so permanent as a dolmen; \nfurthermore, Eschricht\u2019s (1837) craniological study had suggested that Stone Age \npeoples were Indo-Europeans not Finns (Worsaae 1846a:48-51).  Against Molbech, \nWorsaae argued that Celts were always described as agriculturalists (and following \nNilsson, he regarded Stone Age peoples as hunter-gatherers).  There was too abrupt a \ntransition from Stone to Bronze for this to be an internal development; the Bronze \nAge must have represented an immigration of new people.  Thus while the Bronze \nAge in parts of Europe might have involved Celts, the Stone Age could not: \u2018*\u2026there \nare no more grounds for regarding the stone graves as the monuments of a Celtic, than \nof a Finnish people\u2026 they were built by a so-far unknown people\u2026. Not even their \nname or closest relationships do we know\u2019 (Worsaae 1846a:53, original emphases). \n \nIt is therefore more than sufficient to call this \u2018the prehistoric tribe\u2019 \u2013 a name \nwhich one can probably correctly ascribe to them, because at that level of \ndevelopment they are not mentioned in any historical source\u2026 [therefore] one \ncan place the period of florescence of this prehistoric people in western and \nnorthern Europe three to four thousand years back (Worsaae 1846a:54, \noriginal emphases). \n \nMolbech (1847) reviewed Worsaae\u2019s book in generally warm terms, but took issue \nwith a number of points including the claim that forest clearance in the interior would \nhave been minimal without iron tools.  Molbech\u2019s reason was that (given Worsaae\u2019s \nlate date for the Iron Age) this conflicted with \u2018*prehistoric legends\u2019 (Molbech \n1847:686). \n \n 10 \nThe nationalist assault on Denmark came from north and south, Norway and \nGermany.  Norway and Denmark had been united under the Danish Crown since the \nmedieval period, but Norway had been awarded to Sweden by the victorious Allies at \nthe end of the Napoleonic Wars.  Norwegian nationalism was growing in the 1840s, \nand the historian and philologist Peter Andreas Munch (1810-1863) was one of its \nleading proponents.  Suhm (1770) had proposed that the initial migrants from the \nsoutheast had reached the shores of the Baltic near the estuary of the Dvina, and then \ndivided (see above).  One group, ancestral to the Germans, moved west along the \nsouthern shore of the Baltic; the other, ancestral to the Scandinavians, crossed the \nBaltic into what is now eastern Sweden, and spread west and south from there.  \nMunch proposed a variation on this, arguing that the southern or Germanic stream \nhad in fact occupied Denmark as well; most occupants of Denmark had been German-\nspeaking until the mid-first millennium AD, when they emigrated to England \u2013 these \nwere the historically-recorded invasions of the Angles, Saxons and Jutes.  This left \nDenmark largely unpopulated; it was then filled by a migration of Norwegians \n(Munch 1846a and b, 1847).  The colonists of Iceland had also come from Norway.  \nThis meant that Norwegian was the \u2018original\u2019 Scandinavia language, and Munch \ncould claim that all the early literature was not so much Scandinavian, as purely \nNorwegian (Munch and Unger 1847:1-3).  The linguistic term oldnordisk (\u2018Old \nNordic\u2019 or \u2018Old Scandinavian\u2019) should be done away with; the correct term was \noldnorsk (\u2018Old Norwegian\u2019) or simply norsk (plain \u2018Norwegian\u2019), because \ncontemporary Danish had become modernized compared to Norwegian, which \nretained more of its original characteristics (Munch 1849b:46-47). \n \nWorsaae was seriously unimpressed.  He quoted place-name and rune-stone evidence \nto show that there was no trace of an earlier German population in Denmark (Worsaae \n1848:9-10).  He argued that all Scandinavians, not just the ancestral Norwegians, had \ncrossed the eastern Baltic and spread out from there; it was inconceivable that the \ncliffs and wildernesses of Norway should have been occupied before the more \naccessible regions of southern Sweden and Denmark (1849a:10).  The idea that \nnineteenth-century Norwegian was an \u2018older\u2019 language than nineteenth-century \nDanish he disposed of using a joke he had been told in Ireland (which he had visited \nin 1846-47): \n \n*With regard to their linguistic evidence, based on the older nature of the \ncontemporary language in Norway than in Sweden or Denmark, one is almost \nunable to avoid thinking of the Irishman, who upon seeing one of the much \ndiscussed Irish round towers, which had the peculiarity that the lower part was \nbuilt with beauty and precision, while the upper part was highly irregular, said \nwith true Irish wit that the upper part, which clearly displayed a more \nprimitive level of skill, therefore had to be the older part of the tower, and was \nbuilt first (Worsaae 1849a:10-11). \n \nBut Worsaae could not joke his way past German nationalism, because war broke out \nin 1848 and Prussia invaded Denmark in 1848-49. \n \nThis development came about due to the complexities of the infamous \u2018Schleswig-\nHolstein question\u2019, which the British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli is reputed to \nhave said that only three men had ever understood: Prince Albert, who was dead; a \nGerman professor, who had gone mad; and Disraeli himelf, who had forgotten all \n 11 \nabout it.  In the 1840s Danish rule extended further south than it does today, down to \nHamburg.  Schleswig and Holstein (spelt \u2018Slesvig\u2019 and \u2018Holsten\u2019 in Danish) were the \nduchies that formed the base of the Jutland peninsula (fig. 3).  In a complex \narrangement, the King of Denmark was also King of Schleswig, but only Duke of \nHolstein.  Holstein was part of the post-1815 Bund, or German Confederation, while \nSchleswig was not.  Holstein was German-speaking, while Schleswig was mostly \nDanish-speaking.  German was however spreading north through Schleswig, and \nmany in both provinces were attracted to the pan-German nationalism that was \nmaking itself felt.  Schleswig and Holstein rose in armed rebellion against Denmark \nearly in 1848.  A Danish army sent to suppress them was defeated by the rebels with \nhelp from a German army from Prussia, Mecklenburg, Hanover and Oldenburg, \nwhich then went on to invade northern Jutland.  The Germans were however defeated \nand forced to retreat in 1849; in 1850 Prussia withdrew from the war and the \nSchleswig-Holstein rebels were decisively defeated. \n \nGerman historians sought to justify a German occupation not just of Schleswig and \nHolstein, but the whole of the Jutland peninsula \u2013 based on the arguments Munch had \nput forward.  Jacob Grimm (one of the brothers whose name is today principally \nassociated with children\u2019s fairy tales) published a book in 1848 entitled Geschichte \nder deutschen Sprache, \u2018History of the German Language\u2019.  He adopted Munch\u2019s idea \nthat there had originally been German-speakers in Denmark, specifically in the \nJutland peninsula.  In Jutland the local dialect of Danish places the definite article \nbefore the noun (as in English and German), not as a suffix to it (as in the Danish of \nthe islands).  This, for Grimm, was a hangover from the time Jutland spoke German.  \nThe eighth century English historian Bede had said that the Jutes came from Jutland, \nand since southeastern England now spoke a language descended from German, not \nfrom Danish, this meant that the Jutes in Jutland had been German speakers.  What \nwas particularly chilling for the Danes was the conclusion Grimm drew from his \nstudy of linguistic history; Germany, he stated, had a Volksrecht or \u2018national right\u2019 to \nreoccupy all the areas that had formerly spoken German, whether or not they still did \nso.  This meant that Jutland (and Switzerland, Alsace-Lorraine, Belgium and Holland) \nshould become part of a greater Germany; Denmark should cease to exist, \nCopenhagen and the islands being given to Sweden (Adriansen 1996, \u00d8degaard \n1994). \n \nWorsaae used archaeology to counter Grimm\u2019s claims in a number of polemic articles \nin popular journals, reprinted as pamphlets.  Across southern Schleswig stretched a \nseries of ancient earthen fortifications collectively called the Danevirke, and Worsaae \nargued that this represented the southern edge of what he termed Danskheden, or \n\u2018Danishness\u2019.  \u2018*The Danish army has again defended Danevirke\u2019, he started one \npamphlet (Worsaae 1848:1).  Legend had it that the original fortification had been \nbuilt in the tenth century to keep out Germans, volunteers arriving from all over \nDenmark to help in the construction; Worsaae now envisaged volunteers from all over \nScandinavia coming to fight for the Danish cause, and finished with a call to arms: \n \n*The new Scandinavia will not and cannot allow Slesvig to remain German.  \nTherefore go forward undaunted!  The time will surely come when the free, \nthe mighty Scandinavia will remember with pride and joy how the Danish, \nNorwegian and Swedish warriors for the first time fought alongside each \nother, and fought for Danevirke! (Worsaae 1848:64, original emphasis). \n 12 \n \nThis was not, however, to materialise.  Two of Worsaae\u2019s other arguments involved \nthe specific use of the concept of prehistory to counter Grimm.  The first was to stress \nthe uncertainties of the German claim, because \u2018*if the Jutland peninsula\u2026 once had \na particular German population, this was in a definitively prehistoric time\u2019 (op. \nWorsaae 1848:10, original emphasis); and to base a territorial claim on a mere \n\u2018*prehistoric possibility\u2019 (Worsaae 1848:11, original emphasis) would be \u2018*absurd, \neven laughable\u2019 (Worsaae 1848:11) except that the Germans took it seriously.  The \nGermans had much better reason to invade France and England, because Franks and \nSaxons (both of Germanic origin) had occupied both in the historical period, not in \nsome uncertain prehistoric past.  And with tongue in cheek he warned Grimm that \nsuch claims could work both ways: perhaps the Slavs might reclaim regions of \nGermany such as Mecklenburg and Pomerania, which they had occupied until the \nmedieval period!  In another pamphlet the next year, he reiterated that one cannot \nbuild \u2018*contemporary politics upon the prehistoric situation\u2019 (Worsaae 1849a:4).  This \npamphlet has two further distinctions.  It was the first separate work to have the word \nfor \u2018prehistoric\u2019 on its outside cover: Om en forhistorisk, saakaldet \u2018tydsk\u2019 Befolkning \ni Danmark.  Med Hensyn til Nutidens politiske Bev\u00e6gelser [\u2018*On a prehistoric, so-\ncalled \u2018German\u2019 population in Denmark.  With regard to present-day political \nmovements\u2019] (fig. 4).  Secondly, it contained the first use of the noun forhistoriker, \n\u2018prehistorian\u2019: \n \n*Instead of refuting Grimm\u2019s prehistoric basis for Germany\u2019s right of \nconquest, as would definitely have happened in peaceful times, many \notherwise thorough and competent Germans have now praised the \nprehistorians, and it is only outside Germany that the erudition of these people \nhas been subject to counter-argument and refutation (Worsaae 1849a:7). \n \nThis predated the first French use of pr\u00e9historien documented by Clermont and Smith \n(1990) by 23 years. \n \nWorsaae\u2019s second line of prehistoric argumentation was to use his longer time depth, \nand specifically the Stone Age, to demonstrate that Grimm\u2019s claim simply did not go \nback far enough: \n \n*Grimm indeed says with regard to Jutland that this area \u2018from the beginning \nand as far as history can reach has been occupied by purely Germanic tribes\u2019.  \nBut that great academic, who must know the prehistoric period in Jutland far \nbetter than all the Scandinavian archaeologists put together, since he has such \ndefinite information about the ancient German population of the peninsula, \nseems here to have had at the very least a lapse of memory.  For it cannot be \nunknown to him that in Jutland, as in the other lands around the Baltic and \nNorth Seas, as well as in the countries on Europe\u2019s west coast, there are found \nnumerous traces of a primitive original tribe, which did not know metals but \nused tools of stone and bone, and which consequently was at the very lowest \nlevel of culture.  This tribe, which has not just left numerous tools scattered \nabout the fields and in the lakes or bogs, but which also erected a great number \nof truly remarkable stone dolmens in which the corpses were buried in a unique \nand simple manner, cannot have belonged to the German people, which these \n 13 \ndays benefits so hugely from its Volksrecht at the expense of other peoples \n(Worsaae 1850:11-12). \n \nWorsaae clearly saw that his Stone Age extended so far back in time that it made a \nnonsense of any claims for \u2018originality\u2019 based on peoples or languages whose names \nwere known to history.  Worsaae outflanked Grimm\u2019s chronology, just as the Danish \narmy outflanked the invaders and defeated them at the Battle of Fredericia in 1849; \nbut neither victory was to be permanent, as the successful German invasions of \nDenmark in 1864 and 1940 were to show \u2013 not to mention the German attempts to \nfulfill other aspects of Grimm\u2019s agenda in 1866, 1870, 1914 and 1938-40. \n \n \nPREHISTORIC SCOTLAND: DANIEL WILSON, 1851 \n \nDaniel Wilson (fig. 5) is justly famed as the first person to use the English word \n\u2018prehistoric\u2019.  It has been pointed out that Gustave d\u2019Eichthal used pr\u00e9historique in \n1845, and that Wilson might have derived the word from him (Clermont and Smith \n1990:98-99).  There is however no positive indication that Wilson ever read \nd\u2019Eichthal\u2019s monograph, so most histories of archaeology give him the benefit of the \ndoubt, and regard him as the independent inventor of the word.  There is virtually no \ndoubt that he was the first user of the English word.  But in view of the fact presented \nabove, that forhistorisk and f\u00f6rhistorisk appeared in print well over 100 times before \nWilson published his book in 1851 (table 1), we must consider the possibility that he \nderived the concept, and the idea that he needed a word, from Scandinavia. \n \nAgainst this possibility is the fact that Wilson always claimed to have invented the \nword himself.  In the second edition of his book, he wrote of \u2018the term Prehistoric \u2013 \nintroduced, if I mistake not, for the first time in this work\u2019 (Wilson 1863:xiv, original \nemphasis).  After the publication of Lubbock\u2019s Pre-historic Times (Lubbock 1865) he \nevidently wanted to retain priority, for he wrote to Charles Lyell in that year stating \nthat \u2018I coined the word prehistoric for my own use, and it made its appearance for the \nfirst time, unless I deceive myself, in my Prehistoric Annals of Scotland in 1851\u2019 \n(quoted in Kehoe 1998:16, original emphasis).  In a letter to J.W. Dawson in 1880 he \nclaimed the term as \u2018a bantling of my own\u2019 (quoted in Ash 1999:79, n1) \u2013 \u2018bantling\u2019 \nbeing a Scots word for \u2018child\u2019.  But did Wilson mean anything more than that he \ncoined the English term?  His quoted remarks need not imply so. \n \nWilson could not speak or read the Scandinavian languages, so if he acquired any \naspect of \u2018prehistoric\u2019 from Scandinavia it must have been by direct communication.  \nThe person who first comes to mind is J.J.A. Worsaae.  His importance in the \nScandinavian context has been examined above; he repeatedly used forhistorisk; and \nhe visited Scotland in 1846.  But there are grounds for doubting that he was the \nstimulus.  In 1846 Wilson had not yet begun to take an interest in prehistory, but was \nmore concerned with saving medieval buildings in Edinburgh from destruction.  \nWorsaae in any case spent very little time in Edinburgh (Rowley-Conwy in press), \nand he never met Wilson (Ash 1999:71). \n \nThere is however a much more likely suspect: a man who visited Edinburgh in 1849; \nwho became friendly with Wilson and discussed his book with him while it was being \nwritten; and who had already used forhistorisk himself on several occasions.  This \n 14 \nwas none other than Peter Andreas Munch (fig. 6), Worsaae\u2019s Norwegian opponent in \nthe nationalism debates described above.  There is no proof that Munch suggested \n\u2018prehistoric\u2019 to Wilson, but it is highly likely that he did. \n \nFrom Munch\u2019s published letters it emerges that he was in Edinburgh from about 24 \nOctober 1849 to 2 January 1850 (Indreb\u00f8 and Kolsrud 1924:410-12).  Munch \nevidently wrote to Wilson after leaving to thank him for his hospitality; Wilson \nreplied on 11 January 1850 that: \n \nI am much gratified by the sight of your, already, familiar hand, and not the \nless so from the very kind references you make to your visits to our fireside, \nwhich both the good wife and myself look back to with no little pleasure.  I \nonly regret the thought that so long a time must elapse before there can be any \nreasonable chance of my enjoying the same pleasure again.  Meanwhile it will \nbe no little gratification to me to keep up the memory of friendship by an \ninterchange of correspondence; though the gain in point of knowledge will be \nentirely on my side, when we get beyond the interchange of friendly courtesies \n(Indreb\u00f8 and Kolsrud 1924:401).   \n \nOn 17 January he wrote that \n \nI am sure both Mrs. Wilson and myself will long look back to the pleasant \nevenings we have enjoyed with you, when you were content to share our \nhomely ways and Society.  I cannot promise quite so much for the juveniles; \nbut I can assure you they have not forgot you yet, and are by no means \nsatisfied with my replies to their repeated inquiries: \u201cWhy does Professor \nMunch never come to see us now?\u201d (Indreb\u00f8 and Kolsrud 1924:405) \n \nIn 1851 the Wilsons found a suitable governess for Munch\u2019s children, a Miss Buchan, \nthe daughter of a naval surgeon, and Wilson sent a long letter about her to Munch, \nending \u2018Jessie and Jane both send kindest love to little Julia\u2019 (Indreb\u00f8 et al. 1955:2-5).   \n \nIt is clear from this that Munch became a close family friend of the Wilsons and spent \nmuch time in their house. Wilson and Munch had a good deal in common with regard \nto their uses of archaeology; both men came from subordinate national capital cities, \nand both were using archaeology in support of the nationalist stirrings in their own \ncountries.  Both were rather resentful of the pre-eminent position of Copenhagen \narchaeology.  In Scotland it had long been customary to describe antiquities of \nunknown origin as \u2018Danish\u2019 (Graham-Campbell 2004).  Wilson criticised this in his \nbook (1851:xv), adding that any Vikings in Scotland were likely to have been \nNorwegian, not Danish (Wilson 1851:522).  Worsaae published a book in the same \nyear, on the remains of the Vikings in Britain and Ireland (Worsaae 1851).  Worsaae \nwrote about it to Wilson, who sent this rather snide comment to Munch in a letter of \n12 October 1852: \n \nI had a letter from Worsaae lately, at which I could not help smiling.  He \nvolunteers an apology for publishing a book going over the same ground as I \nhad done, in part, in my \u201cPrehistoric Annals\u201d, without making any mention of \nit, but states as the reason, that his book was written long before.  Now I never \ndreamt of any such apology being requisite; but when it was offered it struck \n 15 \nme as a very lame one; for his book was not published here till nine months \nafter mine; and I have the best of reasons for knowing that more than one copy \nreached Copenhagen long before.  But we must have you back to Scotland; \nand back you up with Earls and Dukes, that we may show how different a \ncontribution you will give to our History, Antiquities, and Ethnology, from \nwhat Worsaae has done, with all their aid (Indreb\u00f8 et al. 1955:92). \n \nDuring their fireside chats Munch and Wilson definitely discussed things that were \nrelevant to Wilson\u2019s book.  In his letter of 11 January 1850, Wilson asked Munch to \nreiterate \u2018the argument from whence you infer the non-Scandinavian origin of the \nStennis Stones\u2019 (Indreb\u00f8 and Kolsrud 1924:403).  In Prehistoric Annals he quoted \nMunch\u2019s reply that the name derived from the Scandinavian Steinsnes, or \n\u2018promontory of the stones;\u2019 the fact that Scandinavian settlers gave the place such a \nname implied that they found the stones already standing when they arrived (Wilson \n1851:112, n1).  Wilson also asked for the colloquial Scandinavian names for flint \nartefacts (Indreb\u00f8 and Kolsrud 1924:403); in his book he gave the Norwegian word \ntordenkiler, or \u2018thunderstones\u2019 (Wilson 1851:124), which he had evidently received \nfrom Munch but this time without naming him as the source.  Wilson had even \nconsidered dedicating his book to Munch, but as he wrote to Munch on 30 January \n1851: \n \nI do not know if I told you I had thought of dedicating the Book to you; but I \nhave made so many attacks in it, not only on our own native theories of a \nDanish origin for our Antiquities, but also on some directly traceable to \nCopenhagen, that I thought it would be a questionable compliment, and so I \nhave dedicated it to the Marquess of Breadalbane, our president [of the Society \nof Antiquaries of Scotland] (Indreb\u00f8 et al. 1955:5). \n \nPresumably the Marquess could take the flak. \n \nThe two men evidently discussed Wilson\u2019s book repeatedly and at length.  Most of \nWilson\u2019s book was about the prehistoric period, and it is inconceivable that they did \nnot consider the concept of prehistory, and the need for a term for it.  That the \nScandinavians had their own term, by then in general use, must have been part of the \ndiscussion.  Doubtless Wilson formulated the English term himself, but most probably \nat the prompting of Munch.  This appears to resolve the much-discussed question of \nits origins in the English language. \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nThis paper has shown that Danish, Swedish and Norwegian archaeologists had a \ndeveloped concept of prehistory, and their own term for it, much earlier than is \ngenerally known to historians of archaeology.  From its first publication by Christian \nMolbech in 1834 its use spread, so that well over 100 instances of the words \nforhistorisk and f\u00f6rhistorisk up to 1850 can be listed (table 1).  Many more have \ndoubtless been overlooked. \n \nIn view of the longstanding discussion of the word \u2018prehistoric,\u2019 it is remarkable that \nthis copious usage in the Scandinavian languages has been largely overlooked.  The \n 16 \nAnglo-French literature has been scoured for individuals using the term or displaying \nthe concept, but this has not happened for the Scandinavian literature.  Partly this is \nbecause Scandinavian archaeologists have not (with the exception of Welinder 1991) \nmade much of it in publications in English or French, but mainly it is the language \nbarrier that is to blame.  There has been some mention of the issue in at any rate the \nSwedish literature (Christensson 2005: 76, Hegardt 1997: 117-9), but as noted above, \napparently the only non-Scandinavian authority to mention an early Scandinavian \nusage is Chippindale (1988:310).  Normally assiduous in checking the original \nsources (Chippindale 1988:303), Chippindale was not able to do so in this case, \ncopying his example verbatim from a dictionary (Gyldendals Ordbog over det Danske \nSprog vol. 5, 1923, columns 536-7) without translating or presumably understanding \nit, and was also unable to search for further instances.  The language barrier thus led \nto him considering this to be a single precocious instance, not as part of the \nwidespread mainstream usage it really was. \n \nThe word and the concept did not always go together \u2013 we have seen that Molbech\u2019s \nuse of the term did not entirely correspond to what we now mean by it; and \nparadoxically C.J. Thomsen, arguably the first man with the concept clearly in mind, \ndid not use the term.  But in the end it is no surprise that the nations that invented \nmodern archaeology should also have invented the concept of, and terminology for, \nthe prehistoric period.  From there it percolated into English through Peter Andreas \nMunch\u2019s connection with Daniel Wilson; and the rest, as they say, is history. \n \n \nNOTES \n \nI am very grateful to the following, who have assisted in various ways or helped with \nlocating publications: Stephen Briggs, Margarita D\u00edaz-Andreu, Kerstin Forslund, \nJames Graham-Campbell, Pam Graves, Tim Murray, Leif Fredensborg Nielsen, Anne \nO\u2019Connor, Pamela Rose and Dave Webster; in various bookshops, Ben Bainbridge, \nJohn Turton, Anders Stensager and Christian Westergaard; I also thank two \nanonymous referees, who made suggestions that led to substantial improvements in \nthe paper.  None of these should be held responsible for any of the contents of the \npaper.  \n \n1. All quotations prefixed by an asterisk are translations from the original Danish or \nSwedish by the present author. \n \n2. All uses of the word \u2018prehistoric\u2019 in translated quotes indicate that forhistorisk or \nf\u00f6rhistorisk was used in the original; no other word is so translated.  We accept \n\u2018prehistoric\u2019 so easily as part of our everyday vocabulary that it is easy to overlook it \nin print; it is therefore underlined in the translated quotes in order to make clear its \npresence. \n \n3. Ledetraad contained two chapters, of which Thomsen\u2019s was the second.  The book \nwas therefore not \u2018by\u2019 Thomsen as is sometimes stated.  The title page carries no \neditor\u2019s name, but Briggs (forthcoming, n86) points out that it was commissioned and \nedited by C.C. Rafn, secretary of the KNOS.  I therefore follow Briggs in crediting \nRafn as editor in the bibliography. \n \n 17 \n \n \nBIBLIOGRAPHY \n \nADRIANSEN, I. 1996. \u2018Jyllands formodede tyskhed i oldtiden\u2019 - den dansk-tyske \nstrid om S\u00f8nderjyllands urbefolkning.
