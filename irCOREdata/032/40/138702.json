The reduction of\nthe photoelectric threshold for LiNbO3 due to the polar nature of the crystal allows\nhigh energy UV irradiation to produce free electrons that can participate in\nphotochemical reduction of silver nitrate on the surface. This is in addition to the\npreviously understood phenomenon of domain directed photophysics, where\ninfluences on space charge layer due to the internal dipole of a ferroelectric determine\nthe carrier at the surface. We show that the interaction of photoelectric and domain\ndependent influences can be observed in LiNbO3 due to the low electron affinity (ca\n2eV) and large band bending (0.8eV).\nBody\nThere has been growing interest in the study of the photophysics and photochemical\ninteractions of ferroelectric materials since the late 1990\u2019s. At this time some of the\nearly confusion regarding the nature of the interaction between the semiconducting\nand ferroelectric properties of the materials where being resolved. Furthermore\ninteresting work from Gioncondi and Rohrer1 demonstrated that it was possible to\nspatially separate the reduction and oxidation processes on the surface of a\nferroelectric. This was resolved by examining the influence of the internal dipole of a\npoled ferroelectric on the space charge layer and has led to a number of publications\nhighlighting the influence of semiconductor physics on the surface photochemistry of\nferroelectric systems2,3.\nIn the case of a c+ domain then there is downward band bending and so e- are driven\nto the surface, while in a c- domain there is upward band bending and h+ are driven to\nthe surface. Where we have e- we have a surface that acts to reduce species in contact\nwith the surface and a surface with h+ is oxidative. The exact degree of reductive or\noxidative power of this mobile carrier is determined by the relative position of the\nconduction and valence bands. It is now commonly accepted that the value of the\nNHE in electrochemical terms lies 4.5V (or 4.5eV) from vacuum4. It is, therefore,\npossible to map an electrochemical potential against the band structure of a\nsemiconductor and determine whether there will be reduction or oxidation of solvated\nspecies on the semiconductor.\nThe degree of band bending that is influence by the dipole of the ferroelectric is\ndetermined by a number of factors which include the defect density and magnitude of\nremnant polarisation5. It must also be considered that a ferroelectric material can\nscreen the internal polarisation by external screening which increasingly happens as\nthe defect density reduces or remnant polarisation increases. Examples of opposite\neffects are lead zirconate titanate (PZT) where a high number of defects allow almost\ncomplete internal screening and LiNbO3 where there is a significant degree of\nexternal screening due to low defect numbers. Interestingly there is also an influence\non the photoelectric effect seen on poled semiconductor systems as was demonstrated\nby in 2004 by Yang et al6.\nThe interesting questions that arise from the studies on LiNbO3 that have been\nundertaken so far relate to the subtle differences seen in the work undertaken. Two\ndifferent broad observations have been published \u2013 one shows photo assisted\ndeposition on domian boundaries7 and the other deposition across the bulk of a poled\ndomain8. The differences in the results presented in these reports are in the\nwavelength of irradiation and power of the source used. In cases where a high power\nand therefore higher flux of photons is generated then complete domain decoration\naccording to domain dependent coverage is observed, when a lower power output is\nused then only domain boundaries are sites of nucleation2.\nIn this work, we have used single crystal LiNbO3 that has been poled to present either\nc+ or c- faces. LiNbO3 (z-cut from MTI Corporation) is known to exhibit an hexagonal\nstructure below the Curie temperature of 1210\u00baC with polarization along the c-axis.\nExperiments were conducted using a high energy (400W) UV bulb produced by\nHonle that gives irradiation from 200nm to the band gap energy of the LiNbO3 at ca\n320nm5. Each sample was 0.5mm2 and adhered to a glass slide substrate using silver\nloaded epoxy. Irradiation was performed under 0.01M silver nitrate solution (Aldrich\n99.99%) that was freshly prepared for each sample. A Veeco Dimension 3000\nscanning probe microscope was used to investigate the coverage of the LiNbO3 after\nirradiation with the UV and prior to deposition.\nFig 1 (a) shows the coverage of silver nanoparticles as deposited on the c+ domain of\nthe LiNbO3. This image is consistent with previous work published in the field where\nthe band bending of the semiconductor produces an interface to which either e- or h+\nare preferentially driven. The pattern of silver deposition in discrete particles is due to\nthe localisation of free electrons at surface defects or subsurface defects. This is\ndemonstrated in Fig 1 (b) where a localised nanowire has formed. The surface of the\ncrystal was epi polished and prior to deposition no topographical features could be\nseen. It is likely that the feature of the nanowire has formed due to a sub-surface\ndefect during polishing9. This subsurface feature acts to disturb the local crystal lattice\nand so interferes with the space charge layer. This interference can allow for a build\nup of free carriers in the vicinity.\nThe same experiment was performed on the c- face of the LiNbO3 crystal, the results\nof which are shown in Fig 2. Fig 2 shows that although the space charge layer of the\nsample would inhibit e- reaching the surface there has still been reduction in silver\ncations to silver metal clusters. The size and distribution of the clusters is identical to\nthe initial stages of metal cluster deposition where photogenerated carriers are\nresponsible. We have already demonstrated5 that it is possible to alter the space\ncharge layer of a semiconductor by using high energy superband gap irradiation.\nHowever, in the case of LiNbO3 this would not be expected as the high Pr and low\ndefect density in LiNbO3 generate a large space charge region.\nIn the case of PZT we found that only certain irradiation spectrums produced the\nanomalous deposition on the c- domain. In the case of LiNbO3 both the low intensity\nand high intensity at high energy bulbs produced silver decoration, see reference 5 for\na full spectrum. We believe that the silver being deposited on the c- domains of\nLiNbO3 is being produced as a result of the photoelectric effect. If we accept that the\nelectron affinity is between 1.1 and 1.5eV and the band gap (Eg) is 3.9eV6 we find\nthat photoelectrically generated photons will be able to interact with the Ag+ that are\nbound to the c- surface when photons above ca 4.6eV are incident on the surface. It is\nknown that photons of this wavelength are capable of penetrating the silver nitrate2\nsolution. In Fig 3 we show the proposed mechanism for deposition of silver\nnanoparticles through reduction of silver cations on the surface of a c+ and c- LiNbO3\ndomain.\nUsing the arguments presented above it should be possible to see evidence of the\nphotoelectric effect producing metal nanoparticles on other ferroelectric systems. A\nbody of work has been published on perovskite systems such as BaTiO3 and\nPbZr(x)Ti(1-x)O3 and so some comparisons can be drawn. Taking PZT as a comparative\nsystem a number of electron affinities and band diagrams have been presented in the\nliterature10. Additionally the system has been reasonably well studied using\nphotochemical techniques. It has been shown that energy ranging from 3.8 to 4.5eV is\nrequired to deposited silver nanoparticles on the c+ domains and that only under\nexceptional circumstance can silver reduction occur on the c- domain3,5. Similar\nresults have also been obtained for BaTiO311.\nIn the case of PZT there has been further experimental work, using photochemical\nanalysis using salts of various reduction potentials12, that has shown the conduction\nband (Ec) for PZT lies around 3.5eV from the vacuum and that the band bending\nassociated with polarisation is in the order of 0.5eV. The value of band bending due to\npolarisation is fixed at less than 0.8eV as this the location of the acceptor level\ngenerated by oxygen defects; a value of bending greater then 0.8eV would produce a\ndegenerate semiconductor. We are at present unable to explain some of the PEEM\nresults produced for PZT as PEEM and surface photochemical studies are consistent\nfor LiNbO3. However, it would seem likely that the differences in the band structure\nand mechanisms of polarisation screening are responsible for the observed\ndifferences.\nWe have demonstrated that it is possible to use the photoelectric effect to reduce\nmetal cations on the surface of LiNbO3 c- domains. The effect is shown to be\ndependent on the location of valence band with respect to the vacuum and degree of\nband bending caused by the internal dipole and mechanism of screening polarisation\ncharge.\nThe authors would like to acknowledge Dr Qi Zhang for his help and assistance in\nmaking PZT thin films and sol-gel chemistry and Dr D Gallardo for helpful\ndiscussions.
