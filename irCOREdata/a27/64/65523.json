The twenty-nine studies identified for the review examined the effects of breakfast consumption, sugar intake, fish oil\nand vitamin supplementation and \u2018good diets\u2019. In summary, the studies included in the present review suggest there is insufficient evidence to\nidentify any effect of nutrition, diet and dietary change on learning, education or performance of school-aged children from the developed\nworld.

However, challenges in terms of interpreting the results of such studies within the context\nof factors such as family and community context, poverty, disease and the rate of individual maturation and neurodevelopment will remain. Whilst\nthe importance of diet in educational attainment remains under investigation, the evidence for promotion of lower-fat, -salt and -sugar diets, high in\nfruits, vegetables and complex carbohydrates, as well as promotion of physical activity remains unequivocal in terms of health outcomes for all\nschoolchildren.\nSchoolchildren: Diet: Learning: Behaviour\nThe UK Government and those involved in education are\ncommitted to improving learning and raising standards in\nschools, as well as meeting the needs of individual pupils.\nThere is widespread belief that nutrition and diet may have\na part to play in this process; however, there is a degree of\nuncertainty as to what interventions or supplements work.\nMuch of the available evidence is confusing and contradictory.\nIn essence, parents and those charged with supporting\nand delivering education are seeking clear guidance for both\nindividuals and groups of children, so as to be able to identify\nwhich interventions and supplements may work and which are\nless likely to.\nThe UK Government is committed to promoting healthier\nschools and lifestyles among schoolchildren, for example,\nthrough improving the quality of school meals and introducing\nnutrient-based standards for school meals. Changes to school\nfood provision have been introduced in Scotland(1), England(2)\nand are soon to be introduced in Wales(3). The rationale for\nthese improvements was based on evidence relating to poor\nnutrient and food intake among some school-aged children\ntaken from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey: young\npeople aged 4\u201318 years(4) and from data collected as part of\nnew research on school meals(5).

However, the evidence base to\nsupport clear associations in this area was confused and\nlacked cohesion, and the panel was therefore unable to make\na clear evidence-based statement at the time. As part of\nthe development of school meal standards in England, the\nschool meals review panel requested an assessment into the\nlinks between good nutrition and educational performance.\nThe aim of the present study was to perform a systematic\nin-depth review of published evidence from controlled trials\nthat have investigated the effects of nutrition, diet and dietary\nchange on the learning, education and performance of school-\naged children from the developed world.\nMethodology\nSearch strategy\nA comprehensive search strategy was developed to explore the\naim of the present review (the complete list of the search\nterms is shown in Appendix 1). A computerised systematic\nliterature search was then carried out on the 21 and 22 Decem-\nber 2005. As the topic area lies at the interface between health\nsciences, education and social sciences, the following elec-\ntronic databases were explored: MEDLINE; CINAHL; Psy-\nchINFO; British Educational Index (BEI); Education Research\nInformation Center (ERIC); Australian ERIC; Social Science\nCitation index (SSCI); Applied Social Sciences Index and\nAbstracts (ASSIA); International Bibliography of the Social\nSciences; Sociological Abstracts; SPECTRE; and The British\nLibrary\u2019s electronic table of contents of current journals, and\nconference proceedings (ZETOC).\nAll databases were searched from the date of their inception\nand, where possible, limits were applied to fit the inclusion\ncriteria (listed below). Every citation was stored using the\nEvidence for Policy and Practice Information (EPPI) Centre\nsoftware (EPPI-Reviewer; EPPI Centre, London, UK), where\nthey were combined, de-duplicated and then screened to\nmeet the following inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nAll included studies had to be:\n(1) primary studies reporting empirical research from con-\ntrolled trials (research criterion);\n(2) studies that have been peer-reviewed (i.e. appear in an\nedited journal) (peer-review criterion);\n(3) studies that include an exposure or intervention focusing\non nutrition, diet or dietary change, and at least one of the\nfollowing outcomes \u2013 educational performance, beha-\nviour and motivation in humans (topic criterion);\n(4) studies that include a nutritional and dietary exposure that\ncan be achieved through normal dietary intake (no more\nthan twice the daily recommended dietary reference\nvalue(6)), (dosage criterion);\n(5) studies focusing on school-aged children aged 4\u201318 years\n(age criterion);\n(6) studies written in English (language criterion);\n(7) studies undertaken in developed countries (as defined by\nthe World Bank as countries of \u2018high human develop-\nment\u2019, i.e. a human development index score of .0\u00b78;\nhttp:\/\/web.worldbank.org) (population criterion);\n(8) studies of a duration .5 d (except for high carbohydrate\nstudies where any time frame .2 h is acceptable)\n(duration criterion);\n(9) studies reporting exposures or interventions based in any\ntype of setting \u2013 for example, mainstream, special\nschools, pupil referral units and community centres\n(setting criterion).\nA summary of the methodology is shown in Fig. 1.\nQuantitative and qualitative data were extracted from each\nof the studies selected for in-depth review by two independent\nresearchers, with any discrepancies resolved after consultation\nwith the review group to maintain consistency. Data extraction\ntook place using a specially designed data extraction tool\ndeveloped using the EPPI reviewer software and templates\n(details available at http:\/\/eppi.ioe.ac.uk\/cms\/).\nQuality assurance\nQuality-assurance measures were operational at several levels\nfor the present review.\nLevel 1. To oversee the quality of the review process and\nfinal report production, an external steering group was formed\nwith expertise within the fields of education, social sciences,\nnutrition, paediatric medicine and biochemistry.\nLevel 2. To ensure the efficacy of the search strategy, a\nlist of publications deemed \u2018highly relevant\u2019 within this area\nof interest were selected after consultation with the steering\ngroup(7 \u2013 18). These publications were cross-referenced against\nthe citations captured from the combined searches to ensure\nall were identified. Of these twelve \u2018highly relevant studies\u2019,\neight were included in the present review. Two studies(7,12)\nwere excluded because the dosage of supplements used was\ngreater that 2 \u00a3 dietary reference value for some vitamins\nand minerals, one study(10) was excluded because it was a\ncross-sectional study, and one study(15) was excluded because\nit was not conducted in a developed country as defined by the\nWorld Bank.\nLevel 3. To assess the quality of the papers selected for\nin-depth review, two quality-assurance protocols were utilised.\nThe first protocol was based on the Scottish Intercollegiate\nGuidance Network (SIGN; www.sign.ac.uk) quality-assurance\nassessment for the randomised controlled trial (RCT). This\naccounted for critical quality issues such as randomisation,\nblinding, concealment and intention-to-treat analysis, upon\nwhich a numerical scoring system was applied. The second\nprotocol was based on the quality-assurance template pro-\nduced by EPPI reviewer, which weighted the evidence into\nlow, medium and high categories.\nResults and discussion\nBreakfast\nBy far the largest number of included publications (fifteen:\neight from the USA, three from the UK, one each from\nFrance, Chile, Israel and Sweden) examined the effect of\nbreakfast. Eleven of these studies focused on children within\nthe 4\u201312-year age bracket, whilst the remaining four included\na teenage population. Generally the size of the study popu-\nlations was small (predominantly ,100 participants) and of\nshort duration (,1 week; these studies were included due to\nL. J. Ells et al.928\nB\nri\nti\nsh\nJo\nu\nrn\nal\no\nf\nN\nu\ntr\nit\nio\nn\nthe high carbohydrate content of the breakfast intervention).\nAll studies examined predominantly healthy, mixed sex popu-\nlations from mainstream education. Most participants (where\nrecorded) were white Caucasian, with the exception of those\nparticipating in three studies(11,19,20), who were predominantly\nblack, mixed race and Hispanic, respectively. Ten studies\nreported socio-economic status (using a variety of scales and\nindicators); of these, half recruited children from low-\nincome families and half recruited children from middle- to\nhigh-income families.\nThe type of breakfast interventions investigated fell into five\ncategories: (1) the impact of the provision of breakfast\nclubs(11,19,21,22); (2) breakfast consumption v. fasting(9,13,23 \u2013 26);\n(3) low- v. high-protein breakfast consumption(20); (4) low- v.\nhigh-energy breakfast consumption(8,18); (5) habitual breakfast\nconsumption v. a standardised breakfast consumption(27,28). Of\nthe studies investigating breakfast clubs, three identified a\nsmall but positive impact of breakfast club participation on a\nselection of educational outcomes, whilst the remaining\nstudy found no effect. Four of the six studies investigating\nbreakfast consumption v. fasting identified some improve-\nments (P\u00bc0\u00b705) in problem solving, attention and epidsodic\nmemory after cereal consumption and complex visual display\nafter consuming breakfast, although the remaining two\nstudies were unable to identify any significant differences.\nThe study investigating the protein content of breakfast was\nunable to demonstrate any significant differences between\nconsumption of high- or low-protein breakfasts. When\nenergy content was examined, one study demonstrated a dis-\nadvantage (P\u00bc0\u00b705) of a low-energy breakfast in terms of\nFig. 1. Methodology summary flow diagram.

When habitutal breakfast conditions\nwere compared against a standardised breakfast provision,\nboth studies demonstrated some improvements to cognitive\nfunction after consumption of the standard breakfast. How-\never, although one study(27) demonstrated an increase in\nmemory scale results after consumption of the standard\nbreakfast, this was accompanied by a negative reduction in\nconcentration.\nThe diverse range of different breakfast interventions and\nresearch designs makes it very difficult to draw together the\nfindings presented. The majority of studies (ten out of fifteen),\nhowever, were able to demonstrate that the provision of break-\nfast may have some small benefit to a limited selection of\nshort-term behavioural and cognitive functions. However,\nthis very generalisable overview must be considered within\nthe context of the numerous shortcomings of many of these\nstudies: (1) only three studies considered the impact of habit-\nual diet, which particularly given the very short duration of\nmany of these studies may have had a substantial effect; (2)\nin general, many of the studies failed to adjust for, or even\nacknowledge, many of the factors, which like habitual diet,\nmay impact significantly upon the findings presented; (3)\nthere are a huge number of behavioural and cognitive indices\nthat are important in measuring educational attainment \u2013 how-\never, most studies selected a limited range of subjective and\nobjective methodologies, many lacking appropriate validation,\nwith very little consistency in methodology between studies;\n(4) breakfast clubs often have a social dimension to them,\nfor example, some parents may use them primarily because\nthey provide childcare, so it is difficult to dissociate the\ndifferent benefits; (5) as mentioned previously, many of the\nstudies were of short duration, making it extremely difficult\nto control for different rates of emotional and neurological\nmaturation, as well as being unable to quantify sustainability\nand longer-term benefits. Given these shortcomings, it was\nunsurprising that many of the studies gained very low qual-\nity-assurance scores, with eight achieving a SIGN grading of\nunder ten (out of a possible twenty-seven) and an EPPI\nweighting of low.\nSugars\nSix of the included studies(17,29 \u2013 33) (five from the USA and\none from Canada) investigated the effect of sugar intake on\nlearning and behavourial outcomes in school-aged children.\nAll studies were carried out between 1985 and 1994, and\nexamined a population of pre-teens (3\u201312 years) with the\nexception of one study(32) that included teenagers. Every\nstudy examined the effect of sucrose against aspartame or\naspartame and saccharin in an RCT cross-over design. The\nperiod of exposure to the sugar or sweetener substitutes was\nshort in most cases (1\u20132 d) with the exception of two\nstudies(17,31) which examined each exposure over 1 week.\nOnly one study examined the effects of sugar in an entirely\nhealthy population of children. The remaining studies were\ninvestigated in a population of chidren with symptoms of\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), either on\ntheir own (two studies) or alongside control healthy children\n(three studies). The two small studies (population n 16\nin each) carried out in an all-male \u2018ADHD\u2019 population\nfound no significant difference between the sugar and aspar-\ntame exposure on any of the objective or subjective outcomes\nmeasured. Of the remaining studies, two identified small sta-\ntisticially (P\u00bc0\u00b705) (but often not clinically) significant\nadverse effects on behavioural outcomes in the sucrose\ngroup, whilst another could only identify a disadvantage in\nthe \u2018ADHD\u2019 subgroup. The only long-term diet that combined\nthe sugar or sweeteners into habitual diet rather than a drink\nwas unable to identify any difference between the sucrose\nand sweetener in primary-aged children. This was, inciden-\ntally, the only study also to examine any blood biochemistry.\nHowever, a small but significant improvement was seen in a\nsmall number of the subjective behaviour scores for the\ninfants, although this finding was inconsistent with a signifi-\ncant decrease in the score for one of the objective performance\nmeasures in the same group.\nWhilst all but one study gained reasonable quality-assur-\nance scores (for both EPPI and SIGN), only two studies calcu-\nlated power. As with the breakfast studies, very little attention\nwas paid to important factors, particularly physical activity\nand habitual diet, both of which could significantly impact\nupon the metabolic responses to sugar consumption. Given\nthe small number of studies included and diversity of the\npopulations examined, it becomes difficult to derive any con-\nclusive outcome from these studies. However, the data pre-\nsented do suggest that short-term exposure to sucrose has no\ndramatic detrimental effects on educational and behavioural\noutcomes in school-aged children, when compared with com-\nmonly consumed artificial sweeteners.\nFish oil supplementation\nA total of five included studies(14,34 \u2013 37) examined the effect of\nfish oil supplementation on learning and behavioural out-\ncomes. All studies were carried out during the last 5 years\nand used a placebo-controlled RCT design in a population\naged between 5 and 13 years, with symptoms of neurodeve-\nlopmental disorders (dyspraxia and ADHD). The study popu-\nlation sizes were small, ranging from forty to 117 particpants,\nall of which included both boys and girls although boys\npredominated, probably due to the prevalence of male\nADHD diagnoses. Studies were carried out for periods\nbetween 2 and 4 months and took place in the USA (two\nstudies), UK (two studies) and Japan (one study). The two\nUK and one of the USA studies used fish oil, the other USA\nstudy used an algae-derived oil, and these were taken as cap-\nsules, whilst the Japanese study incorporated the test fish oil\ninto pre-prepared food and drink. The fatty acid composition\nselected for each study differed, with four out of the five\nstudies using a mixture rich in DHA, whilst a recent\nstudy(14) used a composition rich in EPA, which also con-\ntained g-linolenic acid (GLA).\nWhilst all studies gained medium to high quality ratings, the\noutcome assessment measures and results varied considerably.\nOnly two of the studies measured blood biochemistry along-\nside objective testing and subjective parental and teacher\nobservations. However, despite concurrent increases in blood\nconcentrations of the long-chain n-3 fatty acid DHA in the\ntreatment groups, one study(34) found no significant differ-\nences in the behavioural and educational outcomes between\nL. J. Ells et al.930\nB\nri\nti\nsh\nJo\nu\nrn\nal\no\nf\nN\nu\ntr\nit\nio\nn\nthe treatment (345 mg DHA\/d) and control groups. One\nstudy(36) using a dose of 480 mg DHA, 80 mg EPA, 96 mg\nGLA and 40 mg arachidonic acid (AA) per d detected a\nsmall improvement in just two out of sixteen subjective par-\nental and teacher observations after secondary intention-to-\ntreat analysis, although blood fatty acid concentrations\nwere shown to correlate significantly with further parent-\n(P\u00bc0\u00b705) and teacher-rated (P\u00bc0\u00b703) behaviours. Of the\nremaining three studies, one(35) showed a small statistically\nsignificant (P\u00bc0\u00b705) improvement in three out of fourteen\nsubjective parental behaviour scores in the fish oil plus other\nfatty acids (186 mg EPA, 480 mg DHA, 96 mg GLA and\n42 mg AA per d) supplemented group. One study(37) found\nno significant difference between treatment (DHA 3\u00b76 g\/week\nor 514 mg\/d) and placebo groups, apart from a small signifi-\ncant improvement in continuous performance (P\u00bc0\u00b7001) and\nvisual short-term memory (P\u00bc0\u00b702) in the control group\nonly, over 2 months. However, they later reported(38) a signifi-\ncant (P\u00bc0\u00b7001) reduction in aggression in the DHA treatment\ngroup. A recent study(14) was the only study to report consist-\nent significant (P\u00bc0\u00b705) improvements in both objective and\nsubjective behavourial and educational outcomes assessed in\nthe EPA-rich treatment group (558 mg EPA, 174 mg DHA,\n60 mg GLA per d).\nThere remain too many inconsistencies between the studies\nincluded in the present review to reliably inform any con-\nclusion, raising several areas of concern, including: (1) most\nstudies were carried out in children with varying degrees of\nneurodevelopmental disorders, which may raise questions\nover the applicability of these data to mainstream children\nwithout any developmental complications; (2) the trials were\ncarried out in different populations, likely to have differences\nin baseline n-3 long-chain fatty acid status; (3) there was a\nlack of biochemical data \u2013 whilst the extraction of blood\nsamples from child populations raises many ethical impli-\ncations, further metabolic and neurophysiological analyses\nare required in order to place these findings into any mechan-\nistic context and identify differences in baseline status\nbetween different populations; (4) the dosage used in these\nstudies are inconsistent and unlikely to be achieved through\ndietary means in the UK; (5) whilst the fish oils consumed\nin the aforementioned studies appeared to be well tolerated,\nthere is currently no national UK dietary reference value\nand it is essential that optimal dose, duration and fatty acid\ncompositions be established.\nSince the date of the search for studies for the present\nreview, several new RCT studies have been reported at scien-\ntific meetings and have been published. At the International\nSociety for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids (ISSFAL)\n7th Congress in July 2006 two research groups reported on\nthe effects of EPA \u00fe DHA supplementation in primary\nschoolchildren (6\u201310 years). One study(39) in South Australian\nand Indonesian children found no consistent effects on cogni-\ntion in well- and marginally nourished children in a total of\n780 children over 12 months at a dose of 88 mg DHA\/d and\n22 mg EPA\/d. The other study(40) in 355 South African chil-\ndren over 6 months at a dose of 274 mg n-3 long-chain-\nPUFA\/d found not only improved verbal learning, memory\nand spelling ability of subjects, but also lessening of the\nnumber of days they were absent from school. The third\nstudy, now published(41), reported the effects of an EPA\n(558 mg), DHA (174 mg) and GLA (60 mg) daily supplement\nin 132 Australian children aged 7\u201312 years with ADHD over\n15 weeks. They found no significant treatment effects on the\nConners Teacher Rating Scales but significant effects\n(between P\u00bc0\u00b705 and P\u00bc0\u00b701 on the various scores) on the\nConners Parent Rating Scales. Another recently published\nRCT(42) was a follow-up study at 4 years of age of breast-\nfed infants and infants supplemented with and without DHA\nand AA formula. DHA- and AA-supplemented infants had\nsimilar visual acuity and intelligence quotient (IQ) to that of\nbreast-fed infants whilst children who were fed formula con-\ntaining no DHA and AA had significantly poor visual acuity\nand verbal IQ at 4 years of age.\nVitamin and mineral supplementation\nTwo relatively recent studies(16,43) examined the effect of low-\ndose multivitamin and mineral supplementation on measures\nof IQ, assessed by the established Wechsler Intelligence\nScale for Children revised (WISC-R) test. Both studies took\nplace over several months, were well conducted and gained\nhigh quality-assurance assessments. The larger and more\nrecent of the two studies(43) utilised an RCT design in a\nUSA population comprised of predominantly Hispanic work-\ning-class pre-teens (6\u201312 years). The authors reported a\nmoderate, but statistically significant, average increase in the\nnon-verbal IQ (P\u00bc0\u00b7038) of children from the active sup-\nplement group. However, further matched pairing analyses\nindicated that this may have been accounted for by a substani-\ntal net IQ increase from just a small sub-sample of these chil-\ndren. Analysis of blood biochemistry and\/or habitiual diet\nwould have assisted the interpretation of these findings. The\nother smaller, slightly older, case\u2013control study(16), carried\nout in a British population of teenagers (13\u201314 years),\nreported no significant effect of supplementation on verbal\nand non-verbal IQ, although this study may have been\nunder-powered. Interestingly, however, blood biochemistry\nof the participants demonstrated a significant association\nbetween plasma ascorbic acid and non-verbal IQ of boys\n(P,0\u00b7001) and whole-blood glutathione peroxidase activity\nand non-verbal and verbal IQ of both sexes (P\u00bc0\u00b705). This\nhighlights the importance of examining baseline nutritional\nstatus before the functional significance of vitamin and min-\neral supplementation can be determined.\nAlthough well conducted, these two studies alone provide\ninsufficient evidence as to the effects of low-dose vitamin\nand mineral supplementation on the IQ score of schoolchil-\ndren from the developed world. As both of these studies indi-\ncate that particular subgroups of children may be more \u2018at\nrisk\u2019, it is imperative that future studies determine baseline\nand habitual nutritional status. As there may also be potential\nsex and age differences, it remains important to assess mixed\nsex populations powered to represent different age groups.\nOther\nOne study(44) examined the effect of a supplemented diet of\n\u2018good food\u2019 v. no supplementation in a very small group\nof deprived Mexican schoolchildren during their first year of\nelementary school. Whilst significant improvements were\nobserved in the examination results and behaviour of those\nDiet and learning in schoolchildren 931\nB\nri\nti\nsh\nJo\nu\nrn\nal\no\nf\nN\nu\ntr\nit\nio\nn\nchildren who had received the supplemented diet, this study\nlacked detail, quality and rigour, making it difficult to draw\nany reliable conclusions.\nComparison of UK and non-UK data\nOnly six RCT or case\u2013control trial studies were included from\nthe UK (three breakfast studies(9,22,25), two fish oil\nstudies(14,35) and one multivitamin study(16)), all of which\nwere carried out during this decade, with the exception of\none study(9). As there were not sufficient UK studies, the\nsearch strategy was expanded to include other countries cate-\ngorised as \u2018highly developed\u2019 according to the World Bank\ncriterion. It is, however, important to acknowledge the poten-\ntial dietary, economic, social, educational and cultural differ-\nences that may exist between countries. Indeed, the different\nmeasures of educational attainment between the countries\nmade it difficult to draw parallels across the datasets. The\npresent review highlighted the requirement for further high-\nquality, longer-term research to examine the effect of diet\non the educational attainment of UK schoolchildren.\nQuality-assurance issues\nIn general the quality scores for the studies investigating\nsugar, fish oils and multivitamin and mineral supplementation\nwere higher than those investigating breakfast. It is, however,\nimportant to recognise the difficulties of delivering a complex\nintervention such as breakfast within the rigorous framework\nof an RCT. There were, however, several quality-assurance\nissues arising generally across the studies included in the pre-\nsent review.\n(1) Factors that could affect the external validity of the\nstudies included in this systematic review.\nWhilst nearly all studies took account of age and\nsex, ten studies accounted for body weight, six recorded\nethnicity and seven adjusted for disease status (although\nthe majority of these studies were in children with\nADHD-like behaviours). Only five studies considered\nhabitual nutritional and socio-economic status (four of\nthese also accounted for parental education) whilst just\ntwo studies considered family status. As discussed pre-\nviously, habitual dietary intake may have a significant\neffect, particularly in the studies of short duration,\nwhere the body is physiologically adapted to override\nany short-term stresses. Although logistically difficult to\nmeasure in some circumstances, family status may also\nimpact upon measures of educational attainment, through\na complex interplay of socio-cultural modifying effects.\nWhilst not within the scope of the present review,\nfamily status may also be linked to other early life factors\nsuch as low birth weight, weaning, breast-feeding, nutri-\ntion in utero and incidence of illness, which have also\nbeen shown to be implicated in later educational attain-\nment(4,45).\nOnly one study accounted for smoking status,\nwhilst no studies reported alcohol intake, illegal drug\nmisuse or physical activity levels. Whilst it is unlikely\nin very young children that smoking, alcohol and drug\nmisuse are prevalent, it would be prudent to control for\nthese measures, particularly in older children, given the\npotential influence on educational and behavioural\nmeasures(4). Physical activity levels have also been\nshown to positively impact upon cognitive performance\nin school-aged children(46 \u2013 48) and must consequently be\nconsidered as having a potentially important effect in\nall age groups. Similarly, no studies adjusted for locality\nand context, although it is accepted that these factors are\nhighly complex and may be very difficult to control for\nparticularly within \u2018free-living\u2019 situations. However, if\nstudies are carried out under tightly controlled conditions\nsuch as a research laboratory, it raises questions over the\npotential impact of stresses that may be encountered\nwithin this artificial environment and the applicability\nof the findings to \u2018real-life\u2019 situations.\n(2) Maturation and development.\nAlthough the majority of studies focused on the\npre-teen population, only two studies(8,24) formally\nassessed pubertal development. The mean age at entry\nto puberty in UK females is 11\u00b72 years(49), with the cur-\nrent definitions of normality for entry into puberty\nbeing aged 8 years or more in females and 9 years or\nmore in males. Therefore a significant number of studies\nwould have included pre-pubertal and pubertal children.\nIt is now acknowledged that brain and cognitive develop-\nment progresses through puberty(50) and studies assessing\ncognitive function should, if possible, take account of this\n(particularly in short-term studies).\n(3) Measurement of educational outcomes.\nThere was little consistency in methodological\nassessments of educational attainment (including beha-\nviour). The included papers gave rise to a vast array of\ndifferent objective and subjective measures of beha-\nvioural and educational outcomes, often lacking in appro-\npriate validation. This variety of assessment tools may\nhave, at least in part, been accountable to international\ndifferences; however, it may also reflect the vast range\nof indices that make up an educational achievement,\ni.e. the complex interaction of mood, motivation, knowl-\nedge, application and capability, to name but a few.\n(4) Power, concealment, compliance, randomisation and\nblinding.\nStatistical power was calculated in just five of the\ntwenty-nine included studies. In addition to this, the\ndegree to which concealment and compliance was\nreported varied dramatically, which made interpretation\nand comparisons between studies difficult.\nFuture research\nThe current evidence base examining the effect of diet and\ndietary change on educational attainment (including beha-\nviour) remains inconclusive; it is therefore imperative that\nfuture research is undertaken. More research is required\nwithin the UK to investigate the effects of supplementation\n(for example, vitamins and fish oils), specific nutrients (for\nexample, sugar) and complex meals (for example, consump-\ntion and nutritional composition of breakfasts and school\nmeals). However, the limitation of existing studies should\nL. J. Ells et al.932\nB\nri\nti\nsh\nJo\nu\nrn\nal\no\nf\nN\nu\ntr\nit\nio\nn\ninform future research, in order to improve the quality and\ndepth of evidence:\n(1) Additional longer-term or -duration studies are required\nto assess long-term impact, sustainability and overcome\nthe possibility of short-term mechanistic adaptations and\ndifferences in the rate of pubertal maturation and neuro-\nlogical development.\n(2) More studies are required within older (teenage) young\nindividuals.\n(3) Biochemical monitoring is important, not only to estab-\nlish baseline levels of nutrients under investigation, but\nalso to assess compliance and support the understanding\nof mechanisms. However, withdrawal of blood samples\nfrom children requires careful ethical consideration and\nother alternatives such as finger-prick blood, hair and\ncheek-cell analyses should be considered where possible.\n(4) Studies should be statistically powered and provide clear\ndetails regarding randomisation, blinding, concealment\nand compliance, where an RCT structure can be easily\napplied (for example, for supplementation studies). In\nfree-living situations (for example, breakfast), that may\nnot easily fit into the rigid confines of the RCT, extremely\nwell-designed cohort studies should be considered as a\npossible alternative.\n(5) Studies should measure and adjust for all potential coun-\nfounders, where feasibly possible.\n(6) Authors should acknowlege any limitations of their\nresearch and use this to place their findings into context.\n(7) There should be a broad range of investigations that\ninclude children in care, with special needs and from\ndifferent ethnic minority and socio-economic groups, in\norder to address populations that may have different\nneeds to the \u2018mainstream\u2019.\n(8) Authors should base research on existing mechanistic evi-\ndence and where possible use this to place their findings\ninto context.\n(9) We suggest that some consideration be given to the\ndevelopment and use of universal validated measures of\neducational attainment which would assist comparisons\nbetween studies and allow for appropriate meta analyses.\nHowever, although this problem is acknowledged by\nexperts in the field, we understand that it will be difficult\nto achieve a consensus.\nConclusions\nThe effect of nutrition, diet and dietary change on learning,\neducation and performance is clearly an important question\nwith significant policy implications. However, the current evi-\ndence base remains limited and inconclusive. Many studies\nincluded within the present review lacked quality in research\nmethodology and reporting (particularly those investigating\nbreakfast consumption) and failed to account for potentially\nimportant factors, such as habitual dietary intake, physical\nactivity levels, locality and family context. Two-thirds of\nthe included studies were carried out in primary-aged children\nand over a half took place over a short duration (,1 month).\nThere was insufficient quantity and consistency to draw any\nfirm conclusions from the studies examining sugar intake,\nfish oil or vitamin and mineral supplementation. Whilst the\nmajority of included studies examined breakfast interventions,\nthe quality of much of this research remains questionable,\nwhich, in conjunction with the diversity of interventions and\ninconsistency in research design and methodology, made it\nimpossible to reach any definitive conclusions. However,\nalthough the current evidence base remains limited there\ndoes appear to be emerging evidence for effects of certain\nfatty acids, for example, EPA and DHA, as a function of\ndose and time. Furthermore, although not within the scope\nof the present review, this would be consistent with a wealth\nof animal, as well as other human studies, showing effects\nof n-3 fatty acids on brain structure and function, behaviour,\nlearning and performance.\nThe current evidence base would greatly benefit from\nfurther research, particularly based in the UK. However, it is\nessential that future studies reach a high quality standard,\nare representative of all populations (including minority\ngroups), are undertaken for longer duration and use universal\nvalidated measures of educational attainment. Although the\nimportance of this area warrants further research, this will\ncontinue to present many challenges given that the effects\nof nutrition on educational attainment are intrinsically inter-\nwoven with multifaceted factors such as family and commu-\nnity context, poverty, disease and individual rates of\nmaturation and neurodevelopment. Whilst the importance of\ndiet in educational attainment remains under investigation,\nthe evidence for promotion of physical activity and a diet\nlow in fat, salt and sugar but high in fruits, vegetables and\ncomplex carbohydrates remains unequivocal in terms of\nhealth outcomes for all schoolchildren.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank the Food Standards Agency who provided the sole\nsource of funding for the present study.
