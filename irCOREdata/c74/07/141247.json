For sensor applications however the\nhigh level of cross-linking is an issue, since the integration of\nrigid polymers with sensors is not a straightforward process.8 In\naddition to this, rigid polymers are not susceptible to confor-\nmational changes, which could be induced by the binding of\nanalytes and used to enhance the sensor response.9,10 So what\ncan be done to make MIPs with performances that do not rely\non large use of cross-linker? Several years ago we presented one\npotential solution to this problem: in this work11 the problem\nof fluidity of an imprinted thiol monolayer, formed on a gold\nsurface, was solved by the use of an immobilised template.

These sites\nwere stable and had good affinity and specificity for thio-\nbarbituric and barbituric acids. It was therefore interesting to\ntest if the concept, which had been proven for 2-D MIP layers,\ncould work for 3-D polymers as well. Some indications that it\nmight be possible can be deduced from the work of Baggiani\net al., who used immobilised template in MIPs with beneficial\neffect.12 The polymers synthesised in the course of this work,\nhowever, contained high levels of cross-linker and it was\nunclear if the effect would be preserved if cross-linking was\nsignificantly reduced. Another reference could be made to an\nearly publication of Hjerten and co-workers, where protein\nimprinting was performed in gels with relatively low levels of\ncross-linking.4 As reported by Hjerten himself in a personal\ncommunication,13 it seemed that the complete removal of the\ntemplate had a detrimental effect on MIP recognition proper-\nties. One explanation could be that the remaining template\nstabilised the receptor structures in the polymer. The investi-\ngation of this would have been difficult however, since the\ntemplate was not covalently linked to the polymer and infor-\nmation about its concentration in the gel was not available.\nHere we present the first systematic investigation of the use of\nan immobilised template in MIPs prepared with varying degrees\nof cross-linking.Soft Matter, 2009, 5, 311\u2013317 | 311\nExperimental\nReagents\n2,4-Diamino-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine, methacrylic acid (MAA),\nethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), methyl methacrylate\n(MMA), 1,10azobis(cyclohexane carbonitrile), desmetrym,\nterbumeton, isoproturon and melamine were purchased from\nSigma-Aldrich (Dorset, UK). 2,4-Diamino-6-(methacryloyloxy)-\nethyl-1,3,5-triazine was purchased from Wako (Japan). Aceto-\nnitrile and acetone of HPLC grade were purchased from\nAcros Organics (Fisher Scientific UK, Loughborough, UK).\nAll reagents and solvents were of analytical grade and used as\nreceived.Preparation of molecularly imprinted polymers\nThe template molecules: 2,4-diamino-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine\n(template, T), 2,4-diamino-6-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl-1,3,5-\ntriazine (polymerisable template analogue, pT) or a mixture of\nthe two, was placed in a screw-cap vial and dissolved in aceto-\nnitrile. The functional monomer (methacrylic acid, MAA) was\nthen added, followed by a calculated amount of cross-linker:\nEGDMA or its mixture with methyl methacrylate, equal to\naround 80% (w\/w) of the total polymer mixture. The composition\nof the polymers is described in Table 1 and Table 2. For the\npreparation of polymers P5 and P6 the monomer, MAA, was\nreplaced by the same molar quantity of acetic acid to obtain\nrepresentative controls. The initiator, 1,10-azobis(cyclohexane\ncarbonitrile), was added at an amount equivalent to 2% of the\ntotal weight of polymerisation mixture. The solutions were\npurged with nitrogen and the vials were sealed. Polymerisation\nwas performed under a UV lamp (UVAPRINT 100 CVI UV\nsource with 0.163 W cm\u00012 intensity, purchased from Dr Ho\u00a8nle\nAG, Germany) for 15 minutes. The resulted bulk polymers were\nbroken with a steel spatula, manually ground in methanol using\na mortar and wet-sieved to collect polymer particles in the size\nrange 25\u2013106 mm. The fine particles were removed by repeated\nsuspension in methanol, sedimentation and decanting of the\nsupernatant. The collected particles were stored in a solvent for\nfurther study.

The\nmethanol washings deriving from grinding the polymers made\nwith pT were collected and analysed by HPLC-MS to assess the\npresence of non-polymerised pT. The quantification of released\npT was performed using a Waters HPLC in tandem with\na bench-top triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass\nQuattro Micro, Waters, UK) equipped with an electrospray\nprobe. The values of the voltages applied to the sampling cone\n(20 V), capillary (3.02 V), extractor (2 V) and collision cell (2 mV)\nwere optimised by continuous infusion in order to achieve the\nhighest possible sensitivity. HPLC-MS analyses of pT were\ncarried out in SIR mode, where the parent molecule (m\/z 224)\nwas monitored. The electrospray probe was maintained at\n+350 \u0002C with a spray voltage of 450 V for positive ionisation\nmode. The electron multiplier was set at 650 V. For the HPLC\nconditions 80% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid was\nused as mobile phase with a flow rate of 0.2 ml min\u00011 and the\ninjection volume was 10 mL. The column, which was a Luna18\n(3 mm, 3 mm \u0003 50 mm) from Phenomenex (Macclesfield, UK)\nwas kept at 40 \u0002C. The quantification was performed using the\nMassLynx software by monitoring the peak of pT, which had\na retention time of 1.73 min.Chromatographic evaluation\nAn adequate amount of polymer particles suspended in methanol\nor acetonitrile were packed into stainless steel HPLC columns\n(150 \u0003 4.6 mm) at a constant pressure of 2000 psi using a 1666\nSlurry Packer (Alltech, Lancashire, UK). Chromatographic\nmeasurements were performed using an HPLC system, which\nincluded a 325-Kronon Instruments solvents delivery system,\na Kronon Instruments autosampler (UK), and a Bio-Tek\nInstruments model 535 HPLC detector (Vermont, USA). The\npacked columns were first washed on-line with acetonitrile\u2013water\n(85 : 15) at a constant flow rate of 1.5 mL min\u00011 until a stable\nbaseline was reached to ensure the removal of template, which\ncould still have been entrapped inside the polymer after the\nsynthesis. Subsequent chromatographic analysis was executed\nwith the same mobile phase and at the same flow rate (1.5 mL\nmin\u00011). The template concentration and injection volume were\n1 mg mL\u00011 and 20 mL, respectively. Each elution was repeated at\nleast three times to assure reproducibility of the chromatograms.\nThe analysis was performed using UV detection at 250 nm.\nColumn void volumes were measured by injection of 20 mL of\nacetone (0.01%, v\/v) in the corresponding mobile phase.\nCapacity factors (k0) were calculated as (tT \u0001 to)\/to, where tT is\nthe retention time of the eluted substance and to the retention\ntime of the void marker (acetone). The imprinting factor (I) was\ncalculated as I \u00bc k0MIP\/k0NIP, where k0MIP is the capacity factor\nof the template molecule eluted from the imprinted polymer and\nk0NIP is the capacity factor of the template molecule eluted from\nthe non-imprinted polymer.Batch binding experiments for adsorption isotherms\nEquilibrium batch binding experiments were performed to\nobtain the polymer adsorption isotherms and calculate binding\nparameters.

After removal of the polymer particles by\nfiltration, quantification of free T (and by subtraction the\nadsorbed T) was carried out by analysis of the solutions via\nHPLC-MS. For quantification of T concentration, the values\nof the voltages applied to the sampling cone (25 V), capillary\n(4.5 V), extractor (2 V) and collision cell (2 mV) were optimised\nby continuous infusion in order to achieve the highest possible\nsensitivity.

The\nelectrospray probe was maintained at +350 \u0002C with a spray\nvoltage of 450 V for positive ionisation mode. The electron\nmultiplier was set at 650 V. The HPLC conditions were the\nsame as for the analysis of pT, which was described above. The\nquantification was performed using MassLynx software through\na calibration curve built with standard solutions of template.\nThe peak of the template with a retention time of 1.47 min was\nmonitored. The binding parameters (Kd and binding capacity)\nwere estimated by curve fitting using the Grafit package,\nErithacus Software.14and of the analogues tested for cross-reactivity.Evaluation of polymer selectivity by batch binding experiments\nThe selectivity of low cross-linked (12%) MIPs made with\nextractable and polymerisable template (P9 and P12) and the low\ncross-linked (12%) control NIP (C4) was assessed by equilibrium\nbatch binding experiments. The binding of the polymers to\nseveral analogues of the template such as desmetrym, terbume-\nton, pT and melamine was investigated. The binding to a non-\nstructurally related compound, isoproturon, was also studied.\nThe structures of all the tested compounds are reported in Fig. 1.\nThe experiments were carried out by overnight incubation of\n25 mg of each polymer in Zeba spin-cartridges (purchased\nfrom Pierce, Perbio Science, UK) with 500 ml of 0.1 mg mL\u00011 of\neach compounds (including the template), prepared in acetoni-\ntrile\u2013water 85 : 15. The experiments were performed in tripli-\ncates. After incubation the spin-cartridges were centrifuged atThis journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 20096500 rpm for 30 s to separate the supernatant. The solutions were\nthen collected and the concentrations of analytes quantified\nby HPLC using a Gemini C18 (5 mm, 150 mm \u0003 2 mm) from\nPhenomenex. Chromatographic analysis was performed using\nacetonitrile-water (85 : 15) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of\n0.5 mL min\u00011. The injection volume of all the tested compounds\nwas 20 mL. Each injection was repeated at least twice to assure\nreproducibility of the chromatograms. The analysis was per-\nformed using UV detection at 250 nm, except for melamine\nwhich was analysed at 240 nm.\nSwelling analysis\nSwelling experiments were performed using 200 mg of polymer\nparticles (25\u2013106 mm) packed in 1 mL graduated syringeSoft Matter, 2009, 5, 311\u2013317 | 313\ncartridges (Supelco, UK). The cartridges were filled with 0.5 mL\nof acetonitrile. After equilibration at room temperature, the\nexcess of solvent was removed from the polymer by the brief\napplication of reduced pressure (1 min) and the volume of the\nswollen polymer was measured. The swelling ratio (Sr) of\nthe polymers was calculated from the following equation: Sr \u00bc\n(Vs \u0001 Vo)\/Vo, where Vs is the volume of the swollen polymer and\nVo is the volume of the dry polymer.Results and discussion\nTwo triazine compounds were selected as templates for the\nmodel study: 2,4-diamino-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine (T) and 2,4-\ndiamino-6-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl-1,3,5-triazine (pT) (see\nFig. 1). The polymerisable template analogue contains a meth-\nacryloyl residue, which can be used for its immobilisation into\na polymeric network. For a matter of simplicity, this polymer-\nisable analogue will be addressed as \u2018immobilised or polymer-\nisable template, pT\u2019 even if it does not create imprints like\na classic template for molecular imprinting. In the initial phase of\nexperiments several polymers were synthesised containing a fixed\nquantity of methacrylic acid but using different ratios between\nthe polymerisable and non-polymerisable (or extractable)\ntemplates. One polymer was prepared in the absence of any\ntemplate as a control (C1) and two others (P5 and P6) were made\nin the absence of methacrylic acid. The compositions of polymers\nsynthesised are given in Table 1. The affinities of the polymers for\ntemplate were determined by HPLC. The mobile phase selected\nfor this was acetonitrile\u2013water (85 : 15), which allowed the\npolymer affinity to be rapidly analysed. Binding in water or in\npure acetonitrile was too strong, as a result of non-specific\nhydrophobic or electrostatic interactions. The results of testing\nare presented in Table 3. The HPLC data clearly proves that the\npresence of the extractable template in the monomer mixture\nsubstantially enhanced polymer affinity. The imprinting factor\n(comparing results for MIPs and control polymers) was as high\nas 28.7 (for P1).\nReplacing the extractable template with a polymerisable\ntemplate led to a gradual decrease in the measured capacity\nfactor. A similar trend was observed when the polymerisable\ntemplate was injected (data not shown). Since P4, made with\nimmobilised template, still had a small imprinting factor of 1.34,\nit can be concluded that the immobilised template plays someTable 3 Chromatographic performances of the polymers synthesised\nwith different ratios of extractable and polymerisable template\nPolymer\nMolar ratio\nT : pT\nCapacity factora\nk0 \u00bc (tT \u0001 to)\/to\nImprinting factora\nI \u00bc k0(MIP)\/k0(NIP)\nP1 100 : 0 68.50 28.66\nP2 90 : 10 56.00 23.43\nP3 50 : 50 16.50 6.90\nP4 0 : 100 3.20 1.34\nP5 0 : 100 0.2 \u2014\nP6 100 : 0 \u2014 \u2014\nC1 0 : 0 2.39 \u2014\na Flow rate: 1.5 mL min\u00011, mobile phase: acetonitrile\u2013water (85 : 15).\nInjection amounts of template were 1 mg mL\u00011 in a 20 ml injection\nvolume.

This would be in agreement with the work by\nAllender and co-workers, who have reported presence of\ntemplate\u2013template interactions for a triazine compound (atra-\nzine) when testing was performed in 100% acetonitrile.15 In our\nstudy, very little or no binding was, however, observed to poly-\nmers made without MAA using either pT or T (P5 and P6). This\nclearly indicates that in our experimental conditions template\n(T) does not form stable complexes with polymerisable\ntemplate (pT).\nIn the second phase of our work we set out to investigate\nwhether it would be possible to preserve MIP binding sites, at\nleast partially, by decreasing the level of cross-linking and\nconsequently increasing the polymer swelling capabilities.\nThe assumption was that a polymerisable template could assist\nin preserving binding sites through three possible mechanisms,\nschematically presented in Fig. 2. According to the first, the\npolymerisable template can contribute to the creation of specific\nimprinted binding sites in the same way as non-polymerisable\ntemplate does. The swelling process pulls some polymer chains\napart, separating template moieties from their complementary\nfunctional groups within their respective binding cavities\n(Fig. 2A). As a result, the binding sites become temporarily\nvacant and can be occupied either by free template or once again\nby immobilised template molecules. The proximity of the\nimmobilised template would help to preserve the structure of the\npolymer by the reversible nature of the dissociation between\npolymer and polymerised template, preventing the complete\nseparation of neighbouring chains and loss of polymer affinity.\nThe second mechanism relies upon stabilisation of the orienta-\ntion of polymer chains through the template\u2013monomer interac-\ntions (Fig. 2B). In essence, the template plays the role of physical\ncross-linker, which prevents uncontrolled diffusion of polymer\nchains. Another possible mechanism, which needs to be taken\ninto consideration, is the one described in Fig. 2C. In this case,\nthe immobilised template can act as a receptor by binding free\ntemplate through formation of template\u2013template complexes\nor molecular crystallisation. As already explained above, in the\ntested conditions, template\u2013template complexes do not seem\nto take place in highly cross-linked MIPs prepared with pT\n(see testing of P5). On the other hand, as the cross-linking is\ndecreased the polymer swelling and therefore the availability\nof pT would increase and this could enhance the probability to\nhave template\u2013template interactions. Therefore a combination of\nthe three mechanisms in which pT helps in preserving binding\nsites and at the same time behaves both as a physical cross-linker\nand partially as a receptor could be the most plausible.\nThe feasibility of the proposed mechanisms was therefore\nstudied by synthesis and investigation of polymers with\nreduced amounts of cross-linker. To compensate for changes in\nmass, the \u2018\u2018missing\u2019\u2019 cross-linker was replaced with \u2018\u2018inert\u2019\u2019\nmethyl methacrylate. The polymer compositions are presented\nin Table 2.\nThe synthesised polymers were tested chromatographically as\ndescribed above. The results of testing show that for \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019\nMIPs, synthesised using the extractable template, a reduction in\nthe level of cross-linking leads to a massive decrease in polymer\naffinity for template (Table 4).

Table 6 shows\nthat P1, which is the MIP prepared with 80% cross-linking and\nextractable template (T), possessed the highest affinity and the\nhighest concentration of binding sites. The affinity and capacity\nof P1 for the template T was so high that a total binding of the\nsmaller concentrations tested for the experiments was obtained\nproducing a loss of data points (see Fig. S1, ESI\u2020). However, for\ncomparison reasons the testing conditions for P1 were kept as for\nthe other three polymers. P9, which is the MIP synthesised with\n12% of cross-linker and extractable template had the worst\naffinity for T, proving again that low cross-linked MIPs prepared\nwith \u2018normal\u2019 templates are not ideal for analytical applications.\nOn the other hand, P4 and P12, which are MIPs prepared with\npolymerisable template (pT) and 80% and 12% of cross-linker,\nrespectively, seemed to show the opposite behaviour. In fact,\nP12, the low cross-linked MIP, possessed higher affinity for the\ntemplate than P4, even though the latter appeared to have\na higher capacity. These results are in good agreement with the\nmechanisms reported in Fig. 2A and B, where pT, when present\nin the polymer structure, helps in preserving the binding sites in\nlow-cross linked material (affinity of P12 is higher than that of\nP4). At the same time, part of pT might be also acting as\na physical cross-linker helping in maintaining the orientation of\nthe polymer functionalities without producing active binding\nsites (concentration of binding sites of P4 is higher than that of\nP12). This latter observation seems also to disprove the third\nmechanism (see Fig. 2C), which reports template\u2013template\ninteractions in swollen low cross-linked materials. In fact, if this\nwas happening also higher binding capacity and not only affinity\nshould be observed for P12. Baggiani and co-workers have\nreported that in their testing system template\u2013template interac-\ntions seemed to be mainly responsible for the recognition of the\ntemplate by an immobilised analogue.12 Therefore to further\ninvestigate (and possibly further disprove) whether this might be\nthe case with our system, we have analysed the dependence of\nP12 capacity factor on the concentration of template in solution.\nThe expectation was that if the template forms clusters around\nthe immobilised template, then binding should increase upon an\nincrease in template concentration. On the contrary, however,\nthe results of this study look very similar to the plots usually\nobserved for traditional MIPs (see Fig. 3). Thus although it\nwould be impossible to deny that the template under some\ndifferent testing conditions can interact with the immobilised\ntemplate analogue,15 it was not shown to be a major factor316 | Soft Matter, 2009, 5, 311\u2013317involved in the recognition process in our study. There is also no\nevidence that part of non-polymerised pT could act as \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019\ntemplate since polymeric extracts, analysed by HPLC-MS, did\nnot contain traces of this molecule. Practically the entire amount\nof pT present in the monomer mixtures was therefore success-\nfully integrated into the polymers.\nWe have attempted to find further proof of the binding\nmechanisms described in Fig. 2 by measuring the effect of the\ntemplate on polymer swelling. The result of this study, which is\nreported in Fig. 4, confirms that the first two mechanisms are\nindeed plausible. One direct conclusion from these data is that\nthe immobilised template reduces polymer swelling by acting as\nan equivalent of the cross-linker. Furthermore the addition\nof template to the acetonitrile increased polymer swelling by\ninserting among the polymeric chains pushing them apart, which\nis in agreement with the models proposed in Fig. 2A and B. Thus,\nour current understanding is that the first two mechanisms might\nbe the most plausible and possibly are complementing each\nother; the specific binding sites would be created by association\nand dissociation of template\u2013monomer complexes as result of\npolymer chains fluctuations. These chains would remain howeverThis journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2009\nTable 7 P9, P12 and C4 specificity evaluated by equilibrium batch binding experimentsa\nAmount (mg) of adsorbed compound per 25 mg of polymer\nPolymer T pT Melamine Terbumeton Desmetryn Isoproturon\nP9 25.5 \u0005 0.3 13.1 \u0005 0.6 31.6 \u0005 1.4 11.3 \u0005 1.6 8.4 \u0005 3.8 6.8 \u0005 0.7\nP12 26.3 \u0005 1.6 14.1 \u0005 0.5 9.1 \u0005 3.3 4.5 \u0005 0.6 4.5 \u0005 2.2 0 \u0005 0.2\nC4 19.5 \u0005 3.0 18.1 \u0005 0.1 38.6 \u0005 2.4 5.7 \u0005 0.3 6.1 \u0005 0.4 3.4 \u0005 2.8\na The experiments were performed by overnight incubation of 500 mL of 0.1 mg mL\u00011 of each compound with 25 mg of each polymer.

The selectivity of lightly cross-\nlinked polymers (12% cross-linking) P9, P12 and C4 was inves-\ntigated with five different template analogues (see Fig. 1) in\nbatch binding experiments. Template (T), two triazine herbicides\n(desmetryn and terbumeton), pT, a small triazine (melamine) and\na non-triazine herbicide isoproturon, were selected for this study.\nThe results of the experiments are reported in Table 7. P12 shows\nselective binding to T over all of the analogues, with the next\nhighest binding to pT, thus demonstrating the highest selectivity\nfor the template among the polymers tested. P9 shows both\nworse specificity and selectivity. This selectivity study therefore\nsuggests once again that the presence of the immobilised\ntemplate, pT helps to maintain the orientation of the functional\ngroups in the binding cavities, not just improving the affinity, but\nalso the specificity of the resulting polymers.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, we have reported here that the presence of an\nimmobilised template has a positive effect on molecular recog-\nnition in lightly cross-linked imprinted polymers. MIPs syn-\nthesised using a polymerisable template analogue (pT) retained\naffinity and specificity for free template (T) even when prepared\nwith a level of cross-linker as low as 12%. According to the\nexperiments carried out, this is probably due to a double role of\nthe immobilised template, which helps in preserving MIPs\nbinding cavities in low cross-linked materials both by main-\ntaining interactions with the binding sites functionalities and at\nthe same time by partially acting as a physical cross-linker. In\naddition more than one experiment pointed out that under our\ntesting conditions template\u2013template interactions between pT\nand T do not appear to have a major contribution to the\nrecognition capability of the low cross-linked MIPs.This journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2009One interesting opportunity offered by these findings lies in the\npossibility of designing intelligent detection systems where\nfluorescent analogues can be displaced by template from the\nbinding sites. The variations in fluorescence as a result of\na change in the environment of the fluorophore can be used for\nquantification of template in solution. Enhanced polymer\nswelling by the template could also be used in the future for the\ndevelopment of new sensors. Detection in this case could be\nachieved by electrochemical16 or optical17 means.References\n1 G. Wulff, Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. Engl., 1995, 34, 1812\u20131832.\n2 P. A. G. Cormack and A. Z.
