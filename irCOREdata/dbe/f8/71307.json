The limitations of Braudel\u2019s historical and \ngeneral concept can be partially overcome with Elias\u2019s analysis of the connection between \n\u2018technization\u2019 and \u2018civilization\u2019 that allows for both a civilizing and a de-civilizing impact of \nemergent forms of material relation that both lengthen and shorten the chains of \ninterdependence between the members of a society. It is suggested that the concept of the \n\u2018morality of things\u2019 employed by a number of commentators is useful in summarising the \ncivilizing effects of material objects and addressing their sociological significance. From the \nsociology of consumption the idea of materiality as a sign of social relationships can be \ndrawn, and from the sociology of technology the idea of socio-technical systems and actor-\nnetworks can contribute to the understanding of material civilization. It is argued that the \nconcept of \u2018material capital\u2019 can usefully summarize the variable social value of objects but \nto understand the complexity of material civilization as it unfolds in everyday life, an analysis \nof \u2018material interaction\u2019 is needed. Finally the paper suggests some initial themes and issues \napparent in contemporary society that the sociological study of material civilization might \naddress; the increased volume, functional complexity and material specificity of objects and \nthe increased social complexity, autonomy and substitutability that is entailed. A theory of \n\u2018material civilization\u2019 is the first step in establishing a sociology of objects.  \n \nKeywords: Materiality; civilizing process; water; material capital; material interaction \n  - 3 - \nIntroduction \nIt is probably not quite the case that the sociology of objects is a field of enquiry \u2013 \nyet. But there are a number of areas of sociology, and the social sciences more broadly, that \nindicate the beginnings for such a field of enquiry. The argument of this paper is that \nBraudel\u2019s provocative phrase \u2018material civilization\u2019 provides a useful conceptual device for \nbringing together a sociological approach to objects from discussions in history, \nanthropology, social studies of technology and the sociology of consumption. There is not \nthe space in a short paper to do any sort of justice to the range and complexity of these \nvarious explorations of social relationships with material objects so I will no doubt anger \nthose who will insist that such-and-such a field, or so-and-so\u2019s work already does what I am \nproposing here.1 If I do provoke such anger, so much the better: what is perhaps lacking is a \ndebate at the general level of sociology about the significance of material objects in \ncontributing to culture and society in late modernity. \nThe argument can be simply put. The social and cultural relations between \nindividuals in late modern societies would seem to be, more than at any time in the past, \nmediated via material objects. This is not to say that intermediated relations have displaced \nface-to-face relations \u2013 although the electronic technologies of telephony, computing and \nbroadcasting all insert themselves in many of our human to human interchanges. Nor is it to \ngo as far as that arch technological determinist Marshall McLuhan\u2019s buzz phrase, \u2018the \nmedium is the message\u2019 (1994).2 Instead of arguing that the technologies are taking over or \nthat they are determining social life, I want to point to the increasing presence and \nimportance of our material life in constituting what society and culture is. The reason for this \nhistorical effect is of course tied up with technology. Human animals, like all other animals, \nhave always inhabited a material environment, one that we often refer to with the catch all \nterm \u2018nature\u2019. And what has often been treated as distinguishing human animals from other \nspecies is their capacity to take and shape parts of that nature to adapt it to their \n  - 4 - \nrequirements.3 But what technology has led to is a rapidly changing material environment \nexperienced by many humans, especially those in the densely inhabited parts of the \nindustrialized world, that has been made by other humans. The pace of change in this \nmaterial environment and the numbers of people who are involved with it is greater than at \nany time in the past.    \nWhat I will do is to argue firstly that while classical sociological theorists \u2013 with some \nnotable exceptions \u2013 have largely overlooked the role of materiality in modern social \nformations, Braudel offers an historical argument about material civilization. To make this \nargument more properly sociological, I will use Elias\u2019s conception of the civilizing process \nand his discussion of technization. To begin to think about how to study material civilization \nin late modernity, I will draw on some other perspectives, including those associated with \nconsumption and technology. Finally, I will discuss some of the features of materiality in late \nmodernity that might be indicative of the trajectory of its material civilization. \nModernity and materiality \nThe classical sociologists analysed the transformation from traditional to modern \nsocieties with accounts of work, religion, money, mores, culture and social class but they \nhad little to say about material civilization. Marx\u2019s analysis of the economic changes of \ncapitalism led to themes such as the division of labour, class relations and the reorganisation \nof work that were developed by the other classical sociologists, often distinguishing the \nsocial from the economic. Durkheim (1933) focuses on \u2018social solidarity\u2019 and the \u2018conscience \ncollective\u2019, Weber\u2019s analysis (1978) is directed to themes of power, religion, social action and \nrationality and Simmel\u2019s sociology (1950) is concerned with social \u2018forms\u2019, modes of \n\u2018sociation\u2019 and the significance of money (1971).4 These quintessentially \u2018immaterial\u2019 aspects \nof society, that concerned sociology throughout the twentieth century, do not recognize the \nsignificance of material civilization in the historical transformation of society.  \n  - 5 - \nOf course the major exception is Marx himself who identifies the importance of \n\u2018practical, human-sensuous activity\u2019 (Marx 1975: 422) in his early philosophical writing on \nmaterialism. Together with Engels (1971), his later writing documents the impact of \nmechanized manufacturing on the material lives of workers as technology was utilized to \ntransform raw materials into goods for human use.5 Marx understood the impact of machines \non the labour process and the economics of the productive process (Marx 1973: 692-5) but \nhe also showed how introducing machines, especially self-acting machines, transformed the \nmaterial lives of humans as agents in the manufacturing process (Marx 1976: 455-639). \nVeblen too analysed the impact of machinery on work and \u2018workmanship\u2019 (1964) that led to \nthe emergence of a set of social relationships based on increasingly abstract and impersonal \nmodes of action as embodied work became mechanized. These classical authors describe \nthe transformation in material civilization that came with modernity from the perspective of \nindustrial production but remark on the change in material life in general only fleetingly. Marx \ndoes mention that the increase in productivity stimulated demand both for consumer goods \nand for a developed public material environment that included canals, docks, bridges, \ntunnels, gas-works, telegraphy, photography, steam navigation and railways (Marx 1976: \n573). However, the passing remarks that he makes on the importance of consumption in \nmediating production (e.g. Marx 1973: 90-4) are brief and amount to little beside his major \nwork.6 Veblen (1925) is famous for setting out the impact of pecuniary culture as leading to \nsocial distinction and the desire to emulate through conspicuous consumption, but he does \nnot address the impact of artefacts on social and cultural life beyond that of the leisure \nclasses.  \nWriting in 1979 Fernand Braudel (1992) took a rather different view from the classical \nsociologists of the economic developments that led to modern societies. The traditional view \nfrom history focused on economic institutions, including the state, banks and new \ndevelopments such as the joint stock company, to describe the \u2018gradual progress towards \nthe rational world of the market, the firm and capitalist investment\u2019 (Braudel 1992: 23). In \n  - 6 - \ncontrast, Braudel drew attention to the more basic aspects of the lives of everyone in a \nsociety, not just the capitalist and the labourer but also those outside the formal process of \neconomic production. Economics, he argued, is about the practical, everyday business of \nmeeting needs, which includes production and consumption, but also includes material life \nbeyond the sight of economic institutions. This zone of material life lies beneath the zone of \nthe market economy which in turn lies beneath that zone of economic activity where a few \nfavoured key players influence the market: \u2018This rich zone, like a layer covering the earth, I \nhave called for want of a better expression material life or material civilization\u2019 (Braudel \n1992: 23 \u2013 emphasis in the original). Braudel does not suggest that any one layer is \nhistorically determinative but argues that we cannot understand economic history by simply \nstudying the evolution of the market and its institutions or by studying the key players. It is \nhis interest in this lowest zone of material life that goes beyond the production-oriented \nanalyses of Marx and Veblen and even the culture of consumption described by Veblen. \nIn the first of his three volumes Braudel describes material life in its geographical and \nhistorical complexity through a series of themes \u2013 demography, food, costume, lodging, \ntechnology, money and towns (1992: 27). It is in these dimensions of material life that \neconomic history can be seen to shape what it is to be a member of human society. \nBetween the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries, change in these material aspects of social \nlife was slow but in the nineteenth century a rapid period of transformation overcame this \ninertia to produce the material civilization that we associate with modernity. Braudel\u2019s history \nis of the material civilization of the centuries leading up to the industrial revolution: it varied \nacross the world but often not to a great extent. He describes how ordinary life was for most \npeople and, unlike Veblen and Sombart, does not emphasize the material life of the wealthy. \nThere were local ways of doing things and innovations in material life were local rather \nglobal \u2013 this was because change always responded to the complexity of material life as it \nwas lived and the impact of innovation in one aspect of life would affect innovation in \nanother. \n  - 7 - \nIn keeping with the Annales tradition passed on from Febvre and Bloch (Burke 1990), \nBraudel\u2019s history explores the changes in different cultures as the long dur\u00e9e of an epoch \nplays out. A useful illustrative example is water \u2013 water is a component in material civilization \nthat has many ramifications for different aspects of social life and affects demography, food, \nthe development of towns and becomes entwined with money. Many early settlements were \nestablished close to a supply of water not only for drinking but also for cleaning and washing \nand the removal of waste. Where the water source was a substantial river, its flow could \nmeet these needs as well as providing a thoroughfare for trade and a crossing point and \nconjunction for overland routes. The material culture of direct water use develops its own \ntechnology that is primarily about getting it to people for drinking and washing. There were \nfountains, aqueducts and cisterns before the industrial revolution but they were few and far \nbetween and technically very limited. Most drinking water was gathered and moved around \ncities by hand in buckets and in Paris, for example, water from the Seine was delivered by \ntwenty thousand carriers who earned their living doing it. The river water was polluted of \ncourse \u2013 not least by dyers  \u2013 and the Seine was also used for bathing, such as it was, and \nits banks were an open lavatory (Braudel 1992:  228-31). Steam pumps began to appear \ntowards the end of the eighteenth century and during the nineteenth century a rapid series of \ndevelopments separated polluted and fresh water. Daniel Roche (2000) picks up the theme, \nexplaining how water is tied into just about every aspect of everyday material life. Water is \nnot only for drinking but also for making bread, wine and many forms of food \u2013 the wells in \nParis used by the bakers were contaminated with \u2018infiltrations\u2019 that according to Braudel \nmade it taste even worse than the river water (Braudel 1992: 229; see also Roche 2000: \n148). Water for washing bodies and clothes is linked to health and the quality of communal \nlife (Roche reckons there were 2,000 places for washer women along the Seine during the \nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries \u2013 2000: 161). But water also has a symbolic quality in \nreligious ceremonies, most particularly baptism, as well as providing \u2018an element of d\u00e9cor\u2019 \n  - 8 - \nfor the rich who would use it for watering gardens and for decorative fountains (Roche 2000: \n156). \nAs we read these historians of everyday material life we are struck by how different \nlife was just a couple of hundred years ago. Other historians may offer a very different \nanalysis of the pace and causes of change than Braudel but none the less point to a similar \nshift in the material civilization surrounding water. An historian with a very different approach, \nJean-Pierre Gourbet, sees the massive changes brought about by the industrialization of \nwater as proceeding \u201cextremely slowly\u201d over what for Braudel would be a historically very \nshort period between 1880 and 1940 (Gourbet 1986: 23). Braudel says that while the ideas \nof Voltaire\u2019s age would not be so different than the ideas of our own, his material life would \ncontrast dramatically with ours (Braudel 1992: 27-28). But Gourbet points out the impact of \nideas and knowledge about water; its chemical composition, its impact on hygiene and the \ntechnology by which to move it. He also shows how these ideas interacted with the cultural \nacceptance of water into everyday life.7 However, after a long period of little change, the \ncoming of industrialization dramatically changed material civilization and modernity has seen \na continuing rapid transformation in material life since the end of the eighteenth century \nwhen Braudel and Roche finish their histories of everyday life. In late modernity, we in the \nWest have come to take water for granted; we wash our bodies, our clothes, and flush our \nlavatories using water from the same source that we drink from, treating it as \u2018natural\u2019, \nconfident that it will not immediately affect our health.8 We buy electric fountains for the \ngarden, paddling pools for the children, automatic watering and sprinkling systems for \nflowerbeds and greenhouses along with hoses and high pressure jets for cleaning everything \nfrom the car to the stonework on the patio. In the house we can have automatic washing \nmachines, dishwashers, power showers, baths, multiple sinks and toilets and a central \nheating system based on hot water circulated in radiators. Each of these uses draws water \n\u2018on tap\u2019 from an apparently inexhaustible mains supply. What was once a social, public \nprocess in which everyone\u2019s private needs were displayed has become a private, virtually \n  - 9 - \ninvisible process in which \u2018need\u2019 is shaped by cultural influences (Shove 2003). Roche \ndescribes how just a couple of centuries ago the smell of an unwashed body indicated \nprosperity and says \u2018\u2026 the French, associating strong smell with good health, kept up a \nlong-lasting collective distrust regarding all ablutions\u2019 (2000: 158). Today cultural values \u2013 \nand I include the French here \u2013 have reversed so that the unwashed body stands out \noffensively in the crowd of frequently washed and fragrant bodies. In other parts of the world, \nwater is in shorter supply and yet is often used for agriculture or in industrial processes that \nmeet the material needs of richer countries.  \nIn the West we no longer pay for our water with the bodily labour of transporting it, a \npayment that gives a keen opportunity cost to each last cupful, but pay on account with \nmoney for its provision at our behest. As the technology of damming rivers, building \nreservoirs and pumping it long distances has improved, it has transformed the value of water \nand increased the uses we find for it. We expect to have as much as we want and become \nindignant when our local supply becomes contaminated or interrupted. Unwanted water itself \ncan however destroy the material life surrounding water use. After the tsunami in the Indian \nOcean on December 26th 2004, the drinking water supply for millions of people was \ncompromised as the inrush of seawater destroyed the distinction between soiled and fresh \nwater. In the wake of the tsunami drinking water was distributed in sealed plastic bags, then \na couple of weeks later quite unconnected floods in Hexam in the UK cut off water supplies \nto 7000 homes and led to water being given out from bowsers and in plastic bottles.9 In both \nthe industrialized and the developing world the repair of the fresh water supply was an \nurgent technical issue involving plant, chemical treatments, engineers and advice to boil \nwater until safe supplies were reinstated. Inundation with the wrong sort of water requires an \nurgent socio-technical response to sustain the material life of a modern society. \n  - 10 - \nThe civilizing process and technization \nIt is remarkable that the process of material civilization \u2013 which has carried on at a \nstunning pace throughout the twentieth century and of which water is only a small aspect \u2013 \nhas largely been overlooked by sociology. Braudel himself does not try to analyse the social \nimpact of material civilization, he takes his task as merely to note the changes in everyday \nmaterial life that occurred during the pre-modern period. However, Norbert Elias\u2019s \nmagisterial work, The Civilizing Process (1994), which in common with the Annales \napproach takes a very long view of history and attends to some of the ordinary features of \neveryday life, develops a sociological account of civilization as a process. Elias is particularly \nconcerned with court society and the social dynamics of its etiquette that exemplify a change \nin individual behaviour that allows ever larger social formations, resulting in the nation-states \nof modernity. Rather than the fundamentally economic relations that concerned Braudel, \nElias\u2019s focus is on the social relations surrounding the actions of individuals that intrude into \nthe sensibility of others. For him, civilization is a process characterized by a lengthening of \nthe chains of interdependence of individual actions that occurs as people have more contact \nwith more different people whom they know little or not at all but who share the same \nsociety. This occurs, as the classical sociologists recognized, with an increasing division of \nsocial functions and as societies increase in size but for Elias civilization is an historical \nprocess that involves both the gradual change of social structures and a parallel change in \nthe mode of interpersonal relations: \nAs more and more people must attune their conduct to that of others, \nthe web of actions must be organized more and more strictly and accurately, \nif each individual action is to fulfil its social function. The individual is \ncompelled to regulate his conduct in an increasingly differentiated, more even \nand more stable manner. \n(Elias 1994: 445) \n \nAt first glance this civilizing process has little to do with materiality and appears to be \nprincipally to do with patterns of behaviour; the restraint from the use of violence, the \n  - 11 - \nextension through society of civility and good manners, the development of shame and \nrepugnance. But Elias\u2019s argument passes through many elements of materiality, often to do \nwith the management of the body. So, washing one\u2019s hands in water prior to eating becomes \none of the features of courtly manners and the privatization of bathing \u2013 at first covering the \nbody on the way to the communal bathing, later bathing in privacy \u2013 are features of the \nchange in the restraints on behaviour (Elias 1994: 49-52). The introduction of handkerchiefs, \nnapkins, individual cutlery, crockery and beds are all part of the emerging process of \nseparating individual bodily functions and finding ways to minimize the disgust caused to \nothers. As he comments, the importance of waterways and seaports as centres of trade \nnetworks and therefore of population, coincides with a lengthening of chains of social action \nthat required increasing foresight and increasing self-control and affect-inhibition (Elias 1994: \n457). But it is Elias\u2019s use of the development of roadways and traffic as a metaphor to \nexplain the civilizing process that most readily evokes the interconnection of materiality and \ncivilization. He contrasts the simple road system of the warrior society that exchanges \nthrough barter, with the complex road system of modern, money-based economies. The \nroad user in the former society is confronted by a few crude, uneven, unmetalled roads that \nare exposed to damage by wind and rain and where the greatest danger is from attack by \nsoldiers or thieves. But the road user in the modern society has a different mindset because \nthe traffic is thick and fast moving on a complex road system and the greatest danger results \nfrom someone losing their self-control: \u2018If the strain of such constant self-control becomes \ntoo much for an individual, this is enough to put himself and others in mortal danger\u2019 (Elias \n1994: 446).  \nThese remarks on the road system were an aside but Elias returned to the theme in \na paper that specifically addressed the relationship between the civilizing process and \ntechnization (1995). In an uncharacteristic exploration of the statistics of road deaths, he \nshows that the technization of society that occurred with the adoption of the private \nmotorcar, despite its civilizing effects, also produced the unintended de-civilizing effect of \n  - 12 - \ncausing death and injury (Elias 1995: 21). Technization is that process by which \u2018people \nlearn to exploit lifeless materials to an increasingly greater extent for the use of mankind\u2019 \n(Elias 1995: 7) and its motivation is the goal of a \u2018better life\u2019.10 But because each is \ninterwoven with the other, neither civilization nor technization is the leading process or the \ncause of the other. Both are dependent on the human ability to postpone gratification \nthrough self-regulation in the hope of a future increase or stability in gratification \u2013 however, \nat times one of these processes seems to be more dynamic and to create unintended effects \nin the other. Mobility provides gratification for humans either through the experiences it \nopens up or through the sheer pleasure in effortless movement and speed it provides. The \nrevolutionizing of transport throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries seems to have \nbeen progressive; increasing power (speed, distance), increasing independence from natural \nprocesses (such as animal or wind power), increasing control, and operability in increasingly \nalien media (land, water, air, space).11 Elias points out that this trajectory of development \ncan be seen as a coherent process only in retrospect because it was in fact unplanned, \nresulting as it did from \u2018the effects of the interweaving of many individual activities reinforcing \nand counteracting each other\u2019 (1995: 13).  \nThe dangerous and de-civilizing effects of the technization of the motor car were \nrecognized early on and subject to regulation \u2013 Elias reminds us of the laws in nineteenth \ncentury England about men with red flags walking in front and maximum speeds that \nprogressively changed from 4 to, 10 to 20 miles per hour. But a civilizing process that \n\u2018demanded high discipline among the participants, a uniform and moderate self-regulation\u2019, \nalso accompanied the same trajectory of technization and Elias argues that it is the self-\nregulation of drivers which is of the greatest significance in counteracting the de-civilizing \neffect of cars (1995: 18). He recognizes that improvements in the technology of the motor \ncar and of the engineering of roads made motor-cars not only faster but also safer. \nMoreover, social regulations about seat belts and alcohol consumption, speed limits, police \nactivity and traffic engineering have all helped to provide a \u2018social standard\u2019 for self-\n  - 13 - \nregulation. Standardized rules become an internalized habit for drivers so that what might \nappear to be an abstract legal or political process is in fact both expressive of and indicative \nof a civilizing process; \u2018\u2026 individual self-regulation of the driver, the regulation of his or her \nown behaviour in relation to other people, remains undirected and dangerous if it is not \noriented towards socially standard regulations which all drivers share\u2019 (Elias 1995: 25). Elias \nemphasizes civilization as impacting on individuals who internalize standards of behaviour \u2013 \nhe discusses the social response to de-civilizing effects primarily in terms of laws and \nregulations. A rather different approach would emphasize the shift in moral culture that is the \nproduct of a range of socialization processes \u2013 driver training, media advertisements, public \ndiscussion and speed control strategies for example. As drivers respond to the mechanisms \nof socialization within their culture, they develop an embodied relationship with their vehicles \nthat involves far more than just accepting standards of behaviour (Dant 2004). Elias ignores \nboth the moral culture of socialization and the moral effect of material civilization that \nbecomes embedded in material technologies to constrain and direct individual action on the \nroads \u2013 things like local transport planning, road design, vehicle design, speed cameras and \nspeed bumps. Civilization is not only internal as behaviour but is also external as \nsocialization and even takes material forms.  \nA recent literature has begun to address the \u2018morality of things\u2019, (e.g. Costall 1995: \n473; Molotch 2003: 225-59) and the extent to which people or objects can be treated as \nresponsible for a line of action is often raised in relation to the possession of guns \n(Csikszentmihalyi and Rochberg-Halton 1981: 16; Hutchby 2001: 446; Gell 1998: 20-1; \nLatour 1999: 179). Bruno Latour has returned to the theme of the morality of things a \nnumber of times in relation to the effects of door closers (1988, 1992), seat belts (Latour \n1992) and speed bumps (Latour 1992, 1999) \u2013 artefacts that are designed to constrain or \nshape the actions of individuals on behalf of society as a whole. The civilizing effect of \ntechnization that promotes self-regulation is demonstrated where the driver learns to slow \ndown for speed bumps because the de-civilizing effect of their speed, and so the danger to \n  - 14 - \nother road users, is converted into their discomfort and potential damage to their car. This \ndynamic of material civilization suggests that we should be cautious of Elias\u2019s argument \n(1995: 13) that the trajectory of civilization is an unplanned process \u2013 clearly those who \nexercise power on behalf of a community do plan the design and introduction of such \ndevices as speed bumps and cameras. The cultural response that attempts to reduce the \nviolent consequences for others within the society of individual desires, involves a \nlengthening of the chains of interdependence between people. This happens not only \nthrough self-regulation because constraints remain external as legal sanctions (the speeding \nfine) and material forms (the speed bump). \nStudying materiality and society \nIf the classical sociologists had little to say about consumption as a socio-economic \nprocess, it became a lively area for social analysts in a number of disciplines in the latter half \nof the twentieth century (in the UK for example: Douglas and Isherwood 1979; Campbell \n1989; Miller 1987; McKendrick, Brewer and Plumb 1983; Slater 1997). Much of the focus \nwas on the cultural practices that surround consumption and the way that these connect the \nindividual to the society in which he or she lives. To put the matter grossly, what is \nconsumed cannot simply be treated as functional to the animal life of the human but is a \ncultural process that indicates the social status and individual identity of the consumer. The \nconsumption of material objects is part of this process so that the elements of material life \ncan be treated as having meaning. For Jean Baudrillard, whether he is writing about stucco, \nadornment or cloning, material life is taken to be representative of something social that is \nbeyond the embodied experience of the individual (Baudrillard 1993; 2000). For Pierre \nBourdieu social distinction between class fractions is indicated by the effect of taste on \nconsumption (1984). The everyday life theorists, notably de Certeau (1984; Certeau, Giard \nand Mayol 1998) and Lefebvre (1971), also showed how material life could be transformed \nthrough consumption practices around food, clothing and domestic life but the focus was on \n  - 15 - \nthe political impact of these practices. However, the predominant focus in the consumption \nliterature is on cultural meaning and social status rather than on the process of material \ncivilization. \nA parallel and equally multi-disciplinary literature to that of consumption emerged in \nthe 1980s to address the social dimensions of technological development (see for example \nthe edited collections by MacKenzie and Wajcman 1985; Callon, Law and Rip 1986; Bijker, \nHughes and Pinch 1987; Bijker and Law 1992). In contrast to a traditional approach that had \ntraced the social contingencies of technological advances, the social construction of \ntechnology thesis, argued \u2018not only that there is flexibility in how people think of or interpret \nartefacts but also that there is flexibility in how artefacts are designed\u2019 (Pinch and Bijker \n1987: 40). This body of theory and research shifted how technological innovation was \nunderstood; as against any technological determinism in which discrete artefacts emerged \nfrom technologists\u2019 research laboratories to change our worlds, here was an argument that \ncivilization shaped technization just as much as the other way around. Instead of technical \nsystems being seen as relatively autonomous, following Hughes (1983) pioneering work, \nthey became understood as interconnected socio-technical systems and later as \u2018actor-\nnetworks\u2019 in which material objects \u2013 nonhumans \u2013 had a measure of agency alongside that \nof the human actors (Callon 1986; Latour 1988; Law and Callon 1992). \nThe social studies of consumption and of technology have extended particular \naspects of our understanding of the process of material civilization. The study of \nconsumption has shown that material objects have meanings that are implicated in our \nsocial arrangements, specifically in distinguishing and maintaining social structure. \nMateriality is tied up with our everyday concerns, the procession of activities that sustain \nindividual life but also sustain social life. The study of technology has shown that material \nobjects are not \u2018discovered\u2019 like unexplored islands, but that they are \u2018constructed\u2019 through \nsets of social processes that include the capacities of objects themselves. While artificial \nmaterial objects are literally \u2018inanimate\u2019 (despite a continuing human fascination with making \n  - 16 - \nobjects that mimic life), they are imbued and embedded with the social; meanings are \nattributed and built in, capacities and extensions of human action are incorporated within \nthem. The objects created by a civilization both constitute and reflect the nature of that \ncivilization.       \nA way of summarizing these social properties of material objects is to extend the \neconomists\u2019 concept of \u2018fixed capital\u2019 to think of all recognized \u2018things\u2019 as constituting \n\u2018material capital\u2019.12 The value in material objects that are incorporated into social life does \nnot derive exclusively from their origins in production, from their meanings in consumption, \nfrom their practical use in everyday life or from the networks associated with their \nemergence as technical entities \u2013 it derives from all of these. The value of material objects is \nnot stable in relation to the biological needs of humans but is socially variable and changes \nwith the process of material civilization \u2013 how we value water, for example, depends on how \neasily accessible it is. The notion of \u2018material capital\u2019 allows for objects to accrue value that \nis invested by the culture and released by individual use, it can take the form of aesthetic \nqualities, functionality or enhancement of bodily capacity. My car, for example, has a \nmaterial capital that is invested in the object through the skill and effort of designers, \nengineers, manufacturers and marketers to create a bundle of uses; mobility, comfort, social \nstatus, pleasure, carrying capacity. These uses are realised through my everyday \nengagement with the object that can last as long as the material capital has a value. The \nmaterial capital of my car \u2018wears out\u2019 not simply through the car\u2019s engineering wearing out \nbut through its style becoming unfashionable or its comfort or capacity inappropriate to my \nchanging lifestyle or body. Material capital is of course also invested in objects that are \ncollectively owned and used, whether in private or public ownership. Buses and trains, \nswimming pools and water companies are all subject not only to the decline in their material \nproperties as they wear out, but in their technical and aesthetic capacity as material \ncivilization proceeds. The acquisition of material capital involves storing in material objects \nsigns, functions and capacities that can be shared between people, retained for future use, \n  - 17 - \npassed on from one to another and, of course, can ultimately be exchanged for economic \ncapital. What counts as material capital changes with the process of material civilization and \nis not necessarily transferable between stages in civilization. The fashionable frock from one \nera may be discarded as worthless tat or become the much desired antique of another, the \nfunctional workers cottage of one era may collapse or become the highly valued retirement \nproperty of another era. \nMaterial interaction \nOne of the reasons for emphasizing the relationship between materiality and \ncivilization is to shift the attention from the abstract to the material level of existence; it is not \nideas as such that are indicative of a civilization, it is how those ideas are manifest at the \nmaterial level that is important. The materiality of a culture impacts on the materiality of \npeople and it is their embodiment that is at issue; the embedded material capital of objects is \nrealized through its relationship with bodies. Water quenches thirst and washes bodies, but \ncan wash away people and homes, cars give people mobility but can cause damage, injury \nand death to their bodies. There is a risk of \u2018oversocializing\u2019 materiality by treating meanings \nand statuses, networks and agency, as having greater importance than their material effects \non people \u2013 but whatever else material civilization is, it is always embodied. While we may \nsometimes feel that we experience existence through the mind and imagination, the body is \nalways the vehicle of this experience and our engagement with other people and other \nobjects is always mediated through the body. To understand the process of material \ncivilization requires an analysis of material interaction, that is, the concrete relationships \nbetween people and things. Material interaction is the meeting of the materiality of peoples\u2019 \nbodies, including the mind and imagination that are part of those bodies, with the materiality \nof objects, including the qualities and capacities that have been designed and built in by the \ncombined and collective actions of a series of other people.  \n  - 18 - \nA strand of anthropological thinking that has begun to address the social impact of \ninteraction between bodies and the material world finds a key source in Mauss\u2019s (1973) \ndiscussion of \u2018techniques of the body\u2019, first published in 1934. He argued that how people \nused their bodies was not simply \u2018natural\u2019, or animalistic, but was in some senses \u2018cultural\u2019; \nFrench soldiers digging trenches during the first world war could not use English spades and \nvice-versa so that the spades had to be changed when the troops were. For Mauss it was \nthe cultural specificity of the bodily technique of digging that was important but Parlebas \n(1999) extends this to include the world of material objects \u2013 such as sports equipment as \nwell as tools \u2013 that are embedded in a culture that shapes material interaction in ways that \nare not easy to recognize from within the situation. Warnier\u2019s (2001) concept of \u2018praxeology\u2019 \nbrings together the emotional, symbolic and motor aspects that constitute the culture of \nmaterial interaction between bodies and objects.  \nIt is however Maurice Merleau-Ponty\u2019s (1962) phenomenological analysis of being-in-\nthe-world as fundamentally embodied, that situates human being in a materially constituted \nworld engaged through the conscious body and its sensations. The minded body is at the \ncentre of the experience of material civilization and is the medium through which the \neveryday is lived: \u2018In short, my body is not only an object among all other objects, a nexus of \nsensible qualities among others, but an object which is sensitive to all the rest, which \nreverberates to all sounds, vibrates to all colours, and provides words with their primordial \nsignificance through the way in which it receives them\u2019 (Merleau-Ponty 1962: 236).13 \nMerleau-Ponty does not privilege mind over body but rather sees these two aspects \ncombined in a series of relationships between the inside and the outside of bodies, \nespecially perception and intentionality, that are, at least in part, moulded by culture and \nexperience. By developing an approach to the material interaction between bodies in a \nsocial context and the material stuff that society makes available to them, we can begin to \nunderstand some of the detail of the process of material civilization (see for example \nHindmarsh and Heath 2003; Dant 2005: 84-135).  \n  - 19 - \nMaterial civilization in late modernity \nIf Braudel describes the material civilization leading up to modernity and Elias\u2019s \nconcept of technization shows how it accelerates within modernity, then how can we \nunderstand it in late modernity? A way of summarizing material civilization in late modernity \nis to point to the increasing rapidity, complexity and range of technological development. The \nimpact of collective human action does not simply risk local pollution of a social group\u2019s own \nwater supply, it can affect the availability and usage of water for those many hundreds of \nmiles away and for those who have yet to be born. Dams on rivers and the redirection of \nwater can have immense consequences, many unintended or unimagined, that have a \nsocially transforming impact for large populations (Heidegger 1977: 14; Ellul 1965: 323). The \ncritics of technology have pointed to the social impact of such large-scale technologies but \nthere has been less comment on more widespread but smaller changes in material \ncivilization whose impact is cumulative rather than sudden. There are gross changes in the \nprocess of material civilization of late modernity that can be highlighted:  \n \n1) Volume: There are simply more human-produced things in the world, especially \nfilling the lives of those in the rich, western, industrialized countries. In the flow of our \neveryday lives we interact with a greater range of different types of objects; where \nonce there was just the pen and paper, now there is the computer keyboard and the \npersonal organizer as well.  \n \n2) Functional complexity: Electrical, electronic and now digital capacity increasingly \nallows the material objects that fill our lives to fulfil an increasing range of functions. \nThe self-acting industrial machine Marx described now inhabits our everyday lives \u2013 \nthe difference is that we at least feel that we have control over the use and purpose \nof these objects.  \n \n  - 20 - \n3) Material specificity: The plastics, ceramics, metals and other materials of which \nthe goods that surround us are made, are designed for particular uses. The result is \nthat the material that they are made from is less likely to determine the form of \nobjects and their lifespan so that machines and other used objects become obsolete \n\u2013 through fashion or superseded functionality \u2013 long before they are broken or worn \nout. \n \nIt is likely that future historians will identify relatively small items that we take for \ngranted, as having the most significant civilizing effects (the credit card, the contraceptive \npill), but their impact is difficult to gauge close to. However, the increasing volume, \ncomplexity and material specificity of the material world of those of us living in western, \nindustrialized countries can already be recognized as having far reaching civilizing effects as \nthe chains of interdependence between people are lengthened by the materiality of social \nlife. These effects may not be equally distributed throughout the social spectrum but their \neffect is far from restricted to a privileged elite: \n \nFirstly, they lengthen the chains of interdependence as the objects we encounter \nconnect us with more people. Objects, such as the car, mobile phone and computer \nthat extend our communicative ability obviously increase the numbers and types of \npeople with whom we have contact. Other objects that do not so obviously connect \nwith others, such as the washing machine, link us to those who design, manufacture \nand sell it and they connect us to patterns of behaviour that are characteristic such \nas the frequency with which we wash our clothes (Shove 2003). The \u2018morality of \nthings\u2019 is not simply about the constraints on some lines of action, it is also about the \nenabling and promotion of other types and patterns of behaviour. \n \n  - 21 - \nSecondly, the objects with which ordinary people engage demonstrate an increasing \nautonomy of action. The use of clockwork \u2018programmes\u2019 (in domestic washing \nmachines as well as machine tools) has almost completely given way to more \ncontrollable, smaller and cheaper, computer based, controls. When combined with \nfeedback sensors (thermostats, photo-electric cells) many of the objects we \nencounter display degrees of autonomy that would have been a fantasy a few \ndecades ago. Such objects are better able to regulate and pattern our social \nbehaviour. \n \nThirdly, the increased memory, motor and sensory capacity of objects that gives \nthem greater autonomy, means that they are more able to substitute and \u2018delegate\u2019 \nfor human beings and act as an interface between humans.14 Substitution may be of \nmotor or communicative skills \u2013 the electric wheelchair substitutes for motor skills, \nthe answer-phone for communicative skills. Both types may substitute for capacities \nin my body, or for capacities that could be supplied by another body (the wheelchair \npusher, the telephone receptionist). \n \nThese changes in the materiality of everyday life have an impact on the civilizing \nprocess. It seems likely that the increase in the social complexity, autonomy and \nsubstitutability of our material world reduces the direct dependence we have on other human \nbeings as our needs are met by material objects, with a consequent de-civilizing effect. But \nas material objects are interposed between us and other members of our society in networks \nand systems there is a lengthening of the chains of interdependence that connect us to more \nand more distant others. There is a civilizing effect as foresight, planning and self-control are \nrequired, both of ourselves as users of objects and by those who design, promote and \nconstrain our use of them. There are ever longer and more complicated series of people who \ndesign, manufacture, distribute and sustain the material stuff of our everyday lives. But to the \n  - 22 - \nextent that we become less aware of the consequences of our actions on other humans, \nthere is a decivilizing effect.15  \nThe chains of interconnection that create the material environment spread across the \nworld and involve people who share something of our material civilization and the sociality \nthat accompanies it. The civilizing process operates as those along the chain increasingly \nrecognize the effect on other humans of the particular material links that they are involved \nwith. In her account of how techno-systems are enmeshed with everyday life \u2013 including \nthose that use water to clean our possessions as well as us \u2013 Elizabeth Shove writes of the \n\u2018co-evolution\u2026 integration and co-ordination of suites of technologies and practices\u2019 (2003: \n198). Just as our everyday lives adapt to standards of hygiene and cleanliness that are \npartly ideological and partly emergent from material possibilities, so those who deliver these \nsystems are alert to the impact they have. Those who design, manufacture and deliver such \nsystems do not do so from behind the closed doors of a factory but are increasingly aware of \nhow their designs will be received. Herbert Blumer argued that fashion designers were best \nseen as the mediators of the extant culture in expressing a \u2018collective taste\u2019 rather than as \ninnovators or originators (1969). In a similar way, Molotch (2003) undermines the idea that \ndesigners create material objects from their imagination, arguing that a range of socio-\ncultural influences \u2013 including corporate interests, consumer studies, art and design history \u2013 \nall feed into design.  \nConclusions \nI have argued that sociology needs to attend to the changes in material civilization \nthat have shifted the agenda from Marx\u2019s concern with production, via the analysis of \nconsumption to the way that objects affect individual social lives and at the same time, the \nlife of our society. To interact with the material stuff that surrounds us is to unlock the human \nagency that has been \u2018congealed\u2019 within them through design and manufacture \u2013 this is what \nhappens when you turn the key in a car\u2019s ignition or turn on a tap. The habitus of the late \n  - 23 - \nmodern individual is more than ever constituted by material things that are appropriated \nthrough the senses and actions of the body.  \nThe rapidity of change in material culture in late modernity means that it transforms \nfar more quickly than languages can evolve, reversing the dominance of older age groups \nover younger, achieving its impact as much through its practical uses as through its capacity \nto signify social status. As our children teach us how to interact with the mobile phone, they \nare introducing their parents to a new range of objects that were just not there a few years \nago, that demonstrate astonishing functional complexity and are made from materials \nspecifically designed for their purpose \u2013 they can even act autonomously as an answer \nmachine to substitute for us when we are not there. We have found uses for mobile phones \nwithin our everyday lives that could not have been precisely planned or intended by the most \nprescient engineer or entrepreneur. And yet as an object that has supremely symbolized the \nchanging nature of material culture, it has also come to be a bearer of signs of social status \nand worthiness that has appealed to a wide variety of people.  \nWhat the changes in material civilization have produced is a society that we confront \nnot so much directly through our interactions with its members or leaders but through our \ninteraction with the material world that surrounds us. As we interact with the objects that we \nconfront everyday in our lives we are also confronting the society that has designed and \nplaced those objects around us. It is in these objects that the stable, consistent \u2018Other\u2019 of \nsociety is routinely manifest to us, providing the social background against which our warm \nhuman and sociable interactions take place. In the western industrialized world we have \nfashioned the embodied world we live in and in that sense we live in a material society. \n \n  - 24 - \nNotes\n                                                \n1 I have in two books tried to address, admittedly rather unsystematically and far from adequately, \nsome of the themes from this literature (Dant 1999, Dant 2005). \n2 The argument here may at times appear to be a \u2018soft\u2019 technological determinism or at least to have \nfeatures of what Bruce Bimber (1994) calls a \u2018normative technological determinism\u2019 (for a range of \ncontributions to this debate see Marx and Smith 1994). However, the intention is not to argue that \neither technology or materiality determine the state of civilization or society, only that the nature of \ncivilization and the form of society cannot be properly understood without taking into account the \nimpact of materiality on social relations. In the processual account of civilization developed below, no \nsystem, technological or social, determines any other but both have effects that bear on the nature of \nthe other. \n3 Of course the capacity of chimps and other species to use tools has in recent decades diminished \nthe species arrogance behind this presumption. \n4 It should be noted that Simmel does seem to have been interested in some of the impacts of a \nchanging material civilization reflected in his scattered remarks about the impact of fashion, electric \nlight, slot machines, typewriters and so on (1971; 1990). \n5 \u2018By producing their means of subsistence men are indirectly producing their actual material life\u2019 \n(Marx and Engels 1974: 42). \n6 In arguing that \u2018Marx de-emphasized consumption\u2019, Miller refers to this as a \u2018highly unsatisfactory \nsection\u2019 (1987: 48). \n7 I am grateful to an anonymous referee for reminding that Braudel\u2019s is a particular and contested \nview of history and for indicating the relevance of Gourbet\u2019s work here. \n8 Domestic consumption in North America is around 400 litres per person per day, compared with 200 \nlitres in Europe and 10-20 litres in many Sub-Saharan countries (Cosgrove and Risjberman 2000). \n9 Statement from Northumbrian Water, \u2018Hexham water supply\u2019, dated 12th January 2005 posted at \nhttp:\/\/ww.nwl.co.uk, read on 12.01.05. \n  - 25 - \n                                                \n10 \u2018When water for washing and cooking has to be fetched from a well 10 minutes away, and water is \nsubsequently piped into the house, then that represents an improvement in one\u2019s life\u2019 (Elias 1995: 5). \n11 Elias is interested in the creation or emergence of a technology only in passing; technization is \nrelated to but is not the same process as that usually studied by social studies of technology.  \n12 This concept is of course also an extension of Bourdieu\u2019s (1986) account of the \u2018forms of capital\u2019. \n13 Merleau-Ponty\u2019s impact on sociology and the social sciences in general is not easy to trace \nalthough O\u2019Neil (1972; 2004 ) has long argued for his relevance and Crossley (2001) has recently \nused his work to explore a number of themes around the \u2018social body\u2019. \n14 The term delegation here is used in Akrich and Latour\u2019s sense (1992). \n15 For example, as well as the civilizing effect of mobile phones connecting us to more people more \neasily they also lead to the de-civilizing effect of disturbing those around us on trains and in the \ntheatre. But rules, advertisements and social approbation together with the use of \u2018silent\u2019 modes, \ntexting and so on, lead to a further civilizing process.  \n  - 26 - \nBibliography \nAkrich, Madeleine and Bruno Latour 1992 \u2018A Summary of a Convenient Vocabulary for \nthe Semiotics of Human and Nonhuman Assemblies.\u2019 in W.
