It is therefore\nobvious and worthwhile to provide a wall socket\nthat gives them power and networking. However,\na lot of appliances we use in our daily lives are\nused in different rooms and corners of the home.\nMany of these are furthermore small in size, and\ntheir form-factor makes it difficult to plug them\ninto a wall socket, or to supply them with a cable\nand connector. Cradles or docking stations pro-\nvide a means of networking devices like mobile\nphones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), digi-\ntal cameras, or laptop computers, but these are\ndifferent for each device and are not usually\nomnipresent in the home.\nAlthough wireless networking is becoming\nmore popular in the home, it still lacks some\nessential features. Wireless transmission first of\nall costs energy, which means that batteries are\nrequired that need to be recharged or replaced\nat certain intervals. This \u201cfeeding\u201d routine also\nbecomes more tedious as the number of wireless\ndevices increases. A second problem is trans-\nparency: it is no longer obvious what is net-\nworked and why; a natural structure of the\nwireless network is lacking. This could be the\nsource of various problems, especially in relation\nto privacy and security issues.\nWork in home networks includes provision of\nconsumer electronics (e.g., IEEE 1394,\n\u201cFirewire\u201d), the use of existing infrastructure\n(e.g., power line and phone line), and the deploy-\nment of wireless solutions (e.g., 802.11, PAN,\nand Bluetooth). The objective of this article is\nnot to directly challenge any of these develop-\nments, but instead to propose a complementary\ntechnology, addressing a networking design\nspace between wired and wireless technologies.\nThe approach exploits the fact that many\nobjects remain immobile for most of the time,\ni.e. they rest on a table surface, or hang from the\nwall. These supporting surfaces become in our\nconcept the source of both network and power,\nfor all network enabled objects on that surface.\nIf we take the wall as an example of such a\nsurface, then the networked objects could be\ndevices we are already familiar with, such as\nwall-mounted clocks, wall switches, wall lights,\nposters, thermostats, or pushpins. Or they could\nbe completely new objects. A visual characteris-\ntic of these objects is that they have a pin con-\nnector. The fastening to the wall not only\nprovides placement and physical support, but\nadditionally power and network connection.\nIntroducing these devices to a power and net-\nworking source is therefore as straightforward as\npinning them to a wall; hence, the project\u2019s\nname: Pin&Play.\nSURFACES AS A NETWORK\nWe start with introducing the general idea of\nsurfaces as a medium for the objects touching it,\nwhich is more general than the Pin&Play vision.\nThere is a broad spectrum of research that in a\nwider sense is related to ours, such as research\ninto ubiquitous computing networks, on interac-\ntions in smart environments, and also on how\npeople interact with physical space. We will\nbriefly discuss research that is particularly close\nto ours in the networking sense.\nLifton and Paradiso have proposed Pushpin\nComputing [1]. They use a surface with pushpins\nand layered conductive sheets, where direct con-\ntact to the conductive layers in the board is used\nKristof Van Laerhoven, Nicolas Villar, Albrecht Schmidt, and Hans-Werner Gellersen, Lancaster University\nMaria H\u00e5kansson and Lars Erik Holmquist, Viktoria Institute\nABSTRACT\nIntegrating appliances in the home through a\nwired network often proves to be impractical:\nrouting cables is usually difficult, changing the\nnetwork structure afterward even more so, and\nportable devices can only be connected at fixed\nconnection points. Wireless networks aren\u2019t the\nanswer either: batteries have to be regularly\nreplaced or changed, and what they add to the\ndevice\u2019s size and weight might be disproportion-\nate for smaller appliances. In Pin&Play, we\nexplore a design space in between typical wired\nand wireless networks, investigating the use of\nsurfaces to network objects that are attached to\nit. This article gives an overview of the network\nmodel, and describes functioning prototypes that\nwere built as a proof of concept.\nPin&Play: The Surface as\nNetwork MediumIEEE Communications Magazine \u2022 April 2003 91\nto obtain power. Networking is established local-\nly via infrared or capacitive coupling, with neigh-\nboring pushpins in a close (~10 cm) range. In\nthis concept, pushpins feature as explicit compu-\ntational elements to create a new type of archi-\ntecture, based on a huge collection of computing\nelements. The pins are required to be close to\neach other, and the network routing needs to be\ncompletely handled in a distributed fashion,\nwhich increases the complexity a great deal for\nuse as a network in home environments.\nThe Networked Surface at Cambridge Uni-\nversity [2] focuses on horizontal surfaces such as\ndesks and tables. In contrast to Pin&Play, the\ncreated network is primarily aimed at connection\nof higher-end computational devices that are\nplaced on top of it, such as handhelds and lap-\ntop computers. Instead of using layers, the Net-\nworked Surface is composed of cleverly placed\ntiles, such that there are connections to power\nand communication channels at all times.\nObjects can be connected to the surface through\ncircular pads designed to map with connection\npoints onto the tiles. These pads are consider-\nably larger than Pin&Play connectors, which\nmakes this approach less obvious for very small\nobjects. Interesting, however, is that the Net-\nworked Surface also provides information about\nposition and orientation of objects, to be derived\nfrom the internal surface structure. A drawback\nof this structure is the complexity: the network\nhas to manage a large number of tiles in the sur-\nface and negotiate connection points with object\nadaptors.\nARCHITECTURE\nPin&Play is based on the vision that walls and\nother surfaces can be used as a bus network for\nobjects that become attached to them. This is a\nvision that requires a novel network composi-\ntion, and is concerned with qualities not typically\nconsidered in networking, such as facilitation of\nnetworking devices in the home environment\nand exploitation of affordability for ease of use.\nCOMPONENTS\nPin&Play has four main components:\n\u2022 Surface: physical medium for both data and\npower\n\u2022 Connector: physical device for attachment\nof objects to the medium\n\u2022 Objects: network nodes powered and con-\nnected through the surface\n\u2022 Network: network control and communica-\ntion protocols\nSurface \u2014 The purpose of the Pin&Play physi-\ncal network medium is to provide both network\nconnectivity and power to attached devices.\nInstead of wires, it uses conductive sheets, as the\nobjective is to facilitate entire surfaces as two-\ndimensional networks. As solid sheets would\nleave holes when pin-shaped connectors are\ninserted and later removed, woven fiber sheets\n[3] are used instead. Pin&Play surfaces are com-\nposed of multiple layers of such sheets embed-\nded in common surfaces. An anticipated\nchallenge with the use of sheets rather than\nwires is that the resistance and especially capaci-\ntance can be expected to hinder communication.\nHowever, a range of conductive materials are\navailable that are optimized for low resistance.\nIn general, the surface design is aimed at sim-\nplicity and low cost (e.g., avoiding subdivision\ninto tiles) to support our vision of deployment in\neveryday environments such as the home.\nDeployment of the surface material could, for\ninstance, be envisioned in the form of smart lin-\ning under standard wallpaper in the home, to\nenable entire walls to act as a shared medium\nfor objects that are attached to them.\nConnectors \u2014 The design of Pin&Play connec-\ntors is aimed to support two very different func-\ntionalities in a single mechanism. First, they\nobviously have to support physical connection of\nPin&Play network nodes to the surfaces (they\nwould be the plugs if the network were not sock-\netless). Second, they should support attachment\nof objects based on existing and familiar prac-\ntices. The connector design is therefore based on\npushpins that can be stuck into Surfaces, and\nthat can be removed as easily, thus employing a\ntruly ubiquitous device that is commonplace in\nhome and work environments. The connector\ndesign is further aimed at flexible augmentation\nof objects and hence conceived as an adapter\nrather than a built-in physical interface.\nPin&Play Objects \u2014 The very idea of\nPin&Play is to provide networking to objects\nthat are commonly attached to surfaces, rather\nthan to conventional computing devices. In gen-\neral, we consider two different types of object.\nFirst, we envision that any kind of object that\npeople would attach to vertical surfaces can be\n\u201cupgraded\u201d to a networked object while also\nretaining its original appearance, purpose, and\nuse. This would apply, for example, to picture\nframes, artwork, wall calendars, clocks, light\ncontrols, and so on. Second, we envision objects\nthat succeed today\u2019s mundane and ubiquitous\nconnectors and fasteners, for example, \u201cSmart\nPushpins\u201d that can be used to attach notes to\nboards but in addition provide new functionali-\nty on the basis of being digital and networked.\nObviously, both types of objects require unob-\ntrusive embedding of computation and network\ninterface. In this context it has to be noted that\nPin&Play objects do not require their own\npower supply unless they are required to be on\nin detached mode.\nPin&Play Network \u2014 Objects become powered\nup when they are attached to a surface. It is the\ntask of the network to discover newly attached\nobjects and to maintain network state. The net-\nwork furthermore has to provide the communi-\ncation protocols for the connected nodes. A\nprimary optimization target for the network is to\nsupport large-scale surfaces, high density of\nnodes, and ad hoc integration of previously\nunknown objects, while bandwidth is of lesser\nconcern.\nPROPERTIES OF THE PIN&PLAY CONCEPT\nThe design of Pin&Play differs substantially\nfrom other conventional computer networks and\nother networks proposed specifically for ubiqui-\ntous computing.\nPin&Play is based\non the vision that\nwalls and other\nsurfaces can be\nused as a bus\nnetwork for\nobjects that\nbecome attached\nto them. This is a\nvision that requires\na novel network\ncomposition, and\nis concerned\nwith qualities\nnot typically\nconsidered in\nnetworking.IEEE Communications Magazine \u2022 April 2003 92\nNetworking Properties \u2014 Pin&Play addresses\na design space between wired and wireless tech-\nnologies. On an imaginary scale of ubiquity of\nnetwork access, it goes beyond one-dimensional\nwired structures in providing network access\nacross 2D surfaces, while of course not going as\nfar as offering connection throughout 3D vol-\numes. However, we consider it likely that overall\nhigher density of nodes per room can be\nachieved if the enclosing walls were networked,\nin comparison to the state of the art in wireless\ntechnologies. A main advantage of Pin&Play\nover wireless technologies is that it provides\npower to connected objects, and thus supports\nthe integration of objects that have no batteries\nor other forms of power supply. The approach is\nvery similar to that of a PDA cradle or a laptop\ndocking station, but with minimal constraints\nconcerning where and how to connect the object,\nand with more direct interconnection possibili-\nties.\nUse-Related Properties \u2014 We already stressed\nthat the Pin&Play concept is firmly built on\ncommon structures. It addresses important user\nvalues such as familiarity of the concepts used,\nbetter observability of network configuration,\nand straightforward control in the sense of mini-\nmal-effort attachment and detachment of\nobjects. Pushpin-like connectors provide strong\naffordability, and the user act of connecting an\nobject to the network becomes embedded in the\nact of attaching it to the wall or other surface.\nAnother important property is the free place-\nment of objects on a Pin&Play surface. People\nuse surfaces for meaningful spatial arrangement\nof objects, so it is valuable that surface augmen-\ntation does not constrain such use.\nDeployment Vision \u2014 Pin&Play\u2019s design is\nclearly targeted at real deployment in everyday\nenvironments, such as the home. The compo-\nnents underlying Pin&Play, in particular layered\nconductive fiber sheets and pin-like connectors,\nrequire careful mechanical design but do not\ninvolve sophisticated or expensive technology. If\na satisfactory design is achieved, production at\nlow cost would certainly be realistic.\nNETWORKED NOTICE BOARD PINS\nTo illustrate the kind of application in which the\nPin&Play concept becomes superior to the typi-\ncal wired and wireless approaches, we start with\nan application using extremely small and densely\nnetworked devices. This section introduces a\nsmart version of the common pin that is\nenhanced with processing capabilities and mem-\nory, to store information about the document it\nattaches to a notice board. We will first describe\nthe implementation of each Pin&Play compo-\nnent as introduced in the previous section.\nThe Surface: Notice Board \u2014 The surface is\nhere embodied by a notice board, physically aug-\nmented to a network bus by adding two conduc-\ntive layers to an insulating layer (for which both\ncorkboard and adhesive rubber sheets were\nused). The conductive fiber sheets [4], which are\ntraditionally manufactured for shielding applica-\ntions, are not only straightforward to apply; they\nalso leave no holes once the pins have been\nremoved, which ensures longer usability than\nsolid conductive sheets. The fabric is usually sil-\nver (Ag) or nickel-copper (Ni-Cu) plated nylon\nthat has been woven and has a typical thickness\nof 0.1 mm (0.005 in). The conductivity, further-\nmore, is extremely low (i.e., below 0.5 \u2126\/ ).\nThe Network \u2014 To facilitate implementation\nof the network protocol, the Dallas MicroLAN\n[1] was chosen as the base communication layer,\nas it is an inexpensive and flexible networking\nstandard. It only requires two wires (one pro-\nvides a bus for data transmission, plus a ground\nreference), but also allows network nodes to\nsteal power from the data line. A large variety of\nnetwork components that communicate via\nMicroLAN is available and range in application\nfrom simple identification devices and read\/write\nmemories to sensors, data loggers, and switches.\nMicroLAN makes it perfectly possible to\nbuild huge networks with many components that\ncan be dynamically added or removed, supports\ninterrupting, and requires a pull-up voltage\nbetween 2.8 and 6 V. This scalability and flexibil-\nity comes at a price, though: the maximum com-\nmunication bandwidth is at best 16,300 b\/s,\nlimiting the type of network application running\non the bus. The structure of the MicroLAN is\n  Figure 1. A diagram of the pin connectors that access the right communica-\ntion line of the bus network.\nConductive pin surface\nTwo-pin design One-pin design\nIsolated pin surface\nConductive surface layers\nIsolative surface layer\n  Figure 2. A close-up of an assembled pin. The\ncurrent model has two isolated pins for accessing\nthe top and bottom layers. The one-wire switch is\nhidden below the i-Button's connector, next to the\nLED.IEEE Communications Magazine \u2022 April 2003 93\nfurthermore typically a master-slave architecture,\nwhere the master could be connected to the sur-\nface as just another pin, accessing both layers to\nprovide the essential power and communication\nto the board.\nThe network bus master in this application\nwas a common PC, connected to the notice\nboard with a MicroLAN-to-serial adaptor to\ncontrol the network. This task is simple enough\nto be done by a microcontroller, though, which\ncould be integrated in the board in future appli-\ncations that go beyond prototyping.\nThe Connectors \u2014 Our current prototype has\ntwo isolated pins to get into the front and back\nlayer of the corkboard, much like that of the\nPushpin Computing approach [1]. This connec-\ntor design, with the larger pin partly covered\nwith a transparent insulator, has the disadvan-\ntage of being fixed in orientation once it has\nbeen plugged in, and being more vulnerable to\nshortcircuits since the tips of both pins are more\naccessible (Fig. 1).\nAdditionally, the two-pin configuration is\nslightly harder to plug in, and alienates the\nPin&Play pin somehow from traditional pins. It\ndoes, however, already illustrate the ease of pin-\nning an object into the surface to provide it with\npower and networking capabilities. As an alter-\nnative, we also consider a single-pin design,\nwhere the short pin is replaced by an insulated\ncylinder around the longer pin (Fig. 1).\nThe Objects: Smart Pins \u2014 After having dis-\ncussed the connectors, the surface, and a bus\nprotocol, we now move on to the actual objects.\nThe smart pins need to be extremely small (com-\npared to common networked devices) to remain\nusable and familiar to users.\nFigure 2 shows our current prototype pin, which\nhas at its heart a Time-in-a-Can iButton [5]. It is a\nself-sufficient component, containing its own bat-\ntery (3 V Lithium, with more than 10 years data\nretention!), oscillator (32,768 Hz), memory (4096\nbits), internal real-time calendar and clock (preci-\nsion: 2 min\/mo), programmable alarms, and full\nMicroLAN communications support.\nThe pushpin furthermore contains a light\nemitting diode (LED) that can be switched by a\none-wire MicroLAN-compatible switch. Con-\nnecting a single pushpin hence introduces two\nMicroLAN-compatible devices into the network\nthat are just physically bound in the same pack-\nage. The Time-in-a-Can component has internal\nmemory, where it has stored its switch\u2019s unique\naddress, so both components can be bound\ntogether in virtual space as well.\nThe pin is reasonably cheap and robust: the\ntotal sum of required components for one pin is\nabout $US8, using current retail prices, and con-\nsists mainly of established off-the-shelf compo-\nnents. Additionally, the rigid structure of the\nmain component (i.e., an iButton, embodied in\nstainless steel) ensures reliability and a long life-\ntime despite being a prototype. The tiny dimen-\nsions, especially of the Time-in-a-Can iButton\n(approximately centimeters in diameter, 0.6 cm\nin height), produce a total size of a Pin&Play pin\nclose to its traditional equivalent.\nMany applications can be implemented on\nthis hardware platform. A first function we\nimplemented involved an embedded warning\nfunction that highlights documents that have\nbecome irrelevant. A form appears on the dis-\nplay next to the notice board whenever a new\ndocument is attached to it, on which the user\ncan indicate information about the document.\nOne can store all kinds of meta-information on\nthe pin locally, but an expiration time and date\nis of special interest since this information can\nbe stored in the pin\u2019s alarm functions directly.\nWhen the internal alarm of a pin goes off, it\nsends an interrupt via the bus system which trig-\ngers the network master to activate its LED to\nindicate that it needs to be removed. This might\nbe a solution to overcrowded notice boards in\npublic spaces where nobody checks the validity\nof the documents. To avoid confusion, the\n\u201cimportance\u201d of the documents can be used so\nthat only one pin (the one with the highest-pri-\nority document) will light up (Fig. 3).\nThe highlighting of a pin can of course have\nother purposes: to emphasize documents that\nbecome relevant (e.g., to-do items or cinema\ntickets), or to indicate documents of interest to\nthe user in front of the notice board (e.g., per-\nsonal messages) (Figs. 4 and 5).\nLIGHT SWITCHES AND\nOTHER APPLICATIONS\nThe example of the notice board is just one of\nmany application domains. To illustrate that any\nwall-mounted object can be augmented in the\nsame fashion as in the previous example, we\nfocused our attention on one of the most com-\nTo illustrate that\nany wall-mounted\nobject can be\naugmented in the\nsame fashion as\nin the previous\nexample, we\nfocused our\nattention on one\nof the most\ncommon objects\nfound on a wall:\nwall switches that\ncontrol the lights\nin a room.\n  Figure 3. A working example of the networked\nnotice board application. All pins are connected\nto the network bus, and generate an interrupt as\nsoon as they meet their expiration date and time.\nThey are powered by the notice board as well.IEEE Communications Magazine \u2022 April 2003 94\nmon objects found on a wall: wall switches that\ncontrol the lights in a room. Instead of the elec-\ntrician deciding for the inhabitants where these\nswitches belong, one can use the Pin&Play three-\nlayered surface as wallpaper, and put augmented\nswitches anywhere.\nFigure 6 shows the front and internals of a\nPin&Play enabled switch. It can report to the\nnetwork master when the device is being switched\non or off, after which the (preprogrammed)\nappropriate light can be switched. Developing\nmore elaborate appliances such as dimmers or\n\u201csmarter\u201d switches is very straightforward. More-\nover, the network master can be modified to\nkeep logs, automatically activate lights, or moni-\ntor light-switching activity in a home.\nThe user will benefit from the dynamic place-\nment of the switch: if the user desires the wall\nswitch to be located in a different place or orien-\ntation, all that is required is pulling it out of the\nwallpaper and re-attaching it where preferred.\nSpotlights or wall-mounted lights can be attached\nand re-attached in the same fashion.\nThe insulating material used in this imple-\nmentation is a flexible rubber sheet material\nwith an adhesive side, to make it easier to glue\nthe conductive fabric on. One could imagine this\nprocess to be automation-friendly, enabling mass\nproduction of flexible layered wallpaper, which\ncan be installed at low cost in both office and\nhome environments.\nThe components of the surface material are\nvery flexible, which suggests that we don\u2019t have\nto limit the applications to rigid surfaces. A lot\nof research in wearable computing focuses on\nembedding circuits in clothing to network sever-\nal worn devices, which fits seamlessly with the\nidea of Pin&Play. The clothing could function as\nthe network surface, on which computing ele-\nments (sensors, memory, etc.) can be attached in\na very ad hoc manner. The fact that decorative\npins already exist for clothing makes it more\nappealing as another possible application.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis article introduces the concepts of the\nPin&Play project, which aims at developing a high-\nly integrated bus network in both office and domes-\ntic environments. Even tiny devices can be\nwall-mounted by means of pin adaptors and a sur-\nface with layers of conductive sheets, to gain power\nand networking capabilities with the freedom of\nbeing plugged in anyplace or in any orientation.\nThe use of off-the-shelf components and the\nMicroLAN network protocol results in robust\nand small prototypes that are cheap, easy to\n(re)produce, and yet more than powerful enough\nfor many applications we envision. The network\ncan handle hundreds of devices in a small (but\ntwo-dimensional) space, which is especially\nattractive in the augmentation of small and\nmobile appliances.\nWe describe some working prototypes and\ndesign choices during the implementation of\naugmented pins and wall-mounted switches, as\nan illustration of typical examples for the\nPin&Play concept. Future goals of the project\nwill encompass the implementation of more such\nexamples.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe Pin&Play assessment project is funded by\nthe European Commission\u2019s Information Sys-\ntems and Technology (IST) (contract code IST-\n2001- 37007), and is a collaboration between\nViktoria Institute (Sweden) and Lancaster Uni-\nversity (United Kingdom).
