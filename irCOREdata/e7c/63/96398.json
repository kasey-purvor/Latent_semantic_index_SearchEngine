Introduction\nBetween 1976 and 1992 the amount of land built up for residential use in the continental United\nStates increased by 47.7%.1 In contrast, population increased by 17.8%, from 216 million people to\n255million people, over this same 16-year period. At first glance, the fact that population increased\nby roughly one-third as much as residential land may suggest that population changes account for\nabout one third of the overall increase, leaving changes in the land area covered by individual\nhouses to account for the other two-thirds.\nIn this paper we conduct a simple decomposition that accounts for the relative contribution\nof demographic changes and individual and household changes in land consumption behavior\nto the growth in residential land in the United States. This decomposition reveals a much more\ncomplex picture of the components of urban expansion than the back-of-the-envelope one-third\ntwo-thirds calculation would suggest. While the contribution of overall population growth, at\n37.3%, is precisely the result of dividing the 17.8% increase in population by the 47.7% increase\nin residential land, only a small fraction of the remaining urban expansion can be attributed to\nlarger houses (i.e. increases in residential land per individual household). Instead, our analysis\ndemonstrates the importance of the increase in the number of households and the spatial shift in\npopulation within the United States to the spatial expansion of residential land.\n2. Data\nResidential Land Data\nThe amount of land built up for residential purposes in 1976 and 1992 is calculated from the data\nset developed in Burchfield et al. (2006). These data are constructed from two publicly-available\nremote-sensing data sets.\nThe most recent of these two remote-sensing data sets, the 1992 National Land Cover Data\n(Vogelmann, Howard, Yang, Larson, Wylie, and Driel, 2001), is derived mainly from 1992 Landsat\n5 Thematic Mapper satellite imagery. The underlying units of observation are 8.7 billion 30\u00d730\nmeter cells on a grid covering the entire conterminous United States. The Earth Resources Obser-\nvation Systems (eros) data center of the United States Geological Survey (usgs) converted the raw\nsatellite images to land cover categories. The process involved generating first-pass boundaries\nof contiguous areas with similar land cover by grouping together contiguous cells with similar\nvectors of reflectance values recorded by satellite imagery. Aerial photographs and ancillary data\nwere then used to refine these boundaries and to assign land cover codes. While 30\u00d730 meter\ncells are much finer than the units of observation of any other data set tracking land developed\nacross the country, they are still coarser than most building structures (over five times larger\nthan the median single-family house and about one half of the median residential lot). Thus,\nmost cells include a combination of covers (e.g., houses, streets, and vegetation). A cell that is\n1This increase is almost identical to the 48% increase in overall developed land (which includes commercial land and\nroads in addition to residential land) reported by Burchfield, Overman, Puga, and Turner (2006). The shares of land\nallocated to residential uses (70%) and commercial\/transportation uses (30%) remained almost unchanged between\n1976 and 1992.\n1\nestimated to be more than 30% covered by constructed materials is classified as developed. If\nthat constructed cover is used mainly for housing then the type of development is classified as\nresidential. Only about 20% of cells classified as residential land are more than 80% covered by\nconstructed materials. Thus, the residential land areas reported below include land occupied by\nhouses but also substantial amounts of land covered by streets, driveways and gardens located in\nthe immediate vicinity of houses.2\nAn earlier data set (us Geological Survey, 1990, us Environmental Protection Agency, 1994)\nclassifies the conterminous us land area into land use and land cover categories circa 1976.3 This\nwas derived mainly from high-altitude aerial photographs, also converted to land use and land\ncover data by the usgs. The process involved drawing boundaries of contiguous areas with similar\nland cover and land use on the basis of aerial photographs and then using these photographs and\nancillary data to assign land cover and land use codes. The us Environmental Protection Agency\n(epa) further processed the data to facilitate their use in geographic information systems, and we\nuse their version(us Environmental Protection Agency, 1994). We filled gaps in these data to obtain\ncomplete coverage for the conterminous United States as detailed in Burchfield et al. (2006).\nWhile there are many similarities between the 1976 and the 1992 data, there are some subtle,\nbut relevant, differences in the thresholds used to classify an area as developed in the 1976 and in\nthe 1992 data. Given this, we believe one should not compare the data directly. Instead, one can\ntake advantage of the fact that, while land is often redeveloped, it is almost never undeveloped. At\nthe national level, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s National Resource Inventory,\nless than 0.8% of developed land was converted from urban to non-urban uses over the 15-year\nperiod 1982\u20131997 (us Department of Agriculture, 2000). With virtually no undevelopment taking\nplace, we can base our analysis on the 1992 data and use the 1976 data only to determine whether\ndevelopment that existed in 1992 was built before or after 1976. Thus 1992 residential land is land\nclassified as residential in the 1992 data. However, 1976 residential land is land classified as urban\nin 1992 that was also classified as residential in 1976. See Burchfield et al. (2006) and the web page\nhttp:\/\/diegopuga.org\/data\/sprawl\/ for a more detailed description.\nIt is worth noting that the element of the residential land data that matters for our decompos-\nition exercise is the growth rate of residential land in different parts of the United States. The\ngrowth rate of residential land area we report is calculated by counting 30\u00d730 meter cells that\nwere not part of an area classified as developed in 1976 but were estimated to have crossed the\n30% threshold of constructed materials by 1992 and used mainly for housing, and comparing this\nto the number of cells already classified as residential in 1976. While there is no other data set that\n2An additional implication of this combination of land covers within a single 30\u00d730 meter cell is that there is room\nfor small-scale infilling in many cells that are already classified in our data as residential development in 1976. This,\ncombined with redevelopment and increasing building heights, allows in some areas to house substantial population\nincreases with only moderate increases in the number of cells classified as residential land, as illustrated below by the\ncase of Portland.\n3The 1976 data actually corresponds to different dates circa 1976. We correct for data not from 1976 by first determ-\nining the portions of each county with data collected in each given year, then estimating the percentage of urban land\nin each of these county portions by assuming a constant local annual growth rate over the period, then splitting urban\nland into residential and commercial according to the proportions recorded in the data for each county portion, and\nfinally aggregating up to the county level. The metropolitan area, state and national figures used in our calculations are\ncomputed as aggregates of the county numbers.\n2\nallows tracking residential development with comparable spatial detail during this period, the\nAmerican Housing Survey reports an annual growth rate of the number of housing units of 1.64%\nbetween 1976 and 1993 (us Bureau of the Census, 1978, 1995). To translate this into an annual\ngrowth rate of the total residential land area, we would need to know the annual growth rate of\nthe average surface area of housing units during this period, and this is not available. Using as\nan approximation the 0.69% annual growth rate of the square footage of the median single-family\nhouse between 1985 and 1993 (us Bureau of the Census, 1988, 1995) yields an approximate annual\ngrowth rate of residential land of 2.34%, which is close to the 2.47% annual growth rate we obtain\nfrom our data.\nDemographic data\nPopulation data corresponds to intercensal county-level population estimates for 1976 and 1992\nfrom the us Bureau of the Census.4 Household data were obtained by interpolating the total\nnumber of households in each county in Census years 1970, 1980, 1990 and 2000 to calculate a\ncounty-level average number of people per household in 1976 and 1992, and then combining this\nwith the intercensal county-level population estimates to obtain the number of households in each\ncounty in 1976 and 1992.\n3. Decomposing changes in US residential land use\nThere is a large and growing literature that seeks to explain the causes of the United States\u2019 ongoing\nurban expansion (often pejoratively referred to as \u2018sprawl\u2019). This literature is concerned with two\nmain questions. First, what has caused changing spatial patterns of development? Or as Glaeser\nand Kahn (2004) put it: Why have cities started to grow outward rather than upward? Second, and\nobviously related, what can explain increasing per-person consumption of land? Such increases in\nper-person urban land may reflect the fact that, on average, people are building larger houses than\nthey used to. Alternatively, the number of dwellings used to house a given population may have\nincreased as a result of changes in the number of individuals living in each house or of some houses\nbeing left empty as, for example, \u2018flight from blight\u2019 sees people abandon housing downtown and\nrelocate to new houses in the suburbs. Of course, these possibilities are not mutually exclusive.\nOur aim is precisely to assess the relative importance of various factors contributing to the growth\nin residential land in the United States.\nImplicit in this discussion, and in much of the literature, is the assumption that increasing\naverage residential land per household is the key factor driving urban expansion in the United\nStates. This section is concerned with assessing that implicit assumption. We do not aim to explain\nwhat may have caused houses to become larger on average. Instead we quantify the importance\nof rising house sizes relative to various demographic factors for the growth in the amount of\nresidential land in the United States. As a first step, we decompose the increase in residential\nland to find the relative contributions of population growth and increasing land use per person.\n4These were obtained from http:\/\/www.census.gov\/popest\/archives\/pre-1980\/co-asr-1976.xls and http:\/\/\nwww.census.gov\/popest\/archives\/EST90INTERCENSAL\/STCH-Intercensal\/STCH-icen1992.txt.\n3\nSome notation will be helpful, so let us define the following variables:\nLti \u2261 Residential land in location i at time t ,\nPti \u2261 Population in location i at time t ,\nlti \u2261\nLti\nPti\n= Average residential land per person in location i at time t .\nThe change in the total amount of residential land in the United States between 1976 and 1992 can\nthen be decomposed into three distinct components:5\nL92us \u2212 L76us = P92us l92us \u2212 P76us l76us\n= (P92us \u2212 P76us) l76us\n}\nContribution of changes in us population: 37.3%\n+ P76us (l92us \u2212 l76us)\n}\nContribution of changes in us residential land per person: 53.2%\n+ (P92us \u2212 P76us)(l92us \u2212 l76us)\n}\nContribution of interactions: 9.5% .\nNote that this decomposition is an identity: the sum of the three individual components exactly\nequals the total change. Thus, it is not an expression one needs to estimate, but instead it is\ncomputed simply by substituting in the actual values of population and land per person in 1976\nand 1992.\nThe first component of this decomposition, (P92us \u2212 P76us) l76us, represents the contribution of\nchanges in us population. This is how much the total amount of residential land in the us would\nhave increased in the hypothetical case that us population had grown as it did over the period\n1976\u201392, (P92us \u2212 P76us), but that us residential land per person had remained constant at its 1976\nlevel, l76us. Plugging in the actual values, the contribution of changes in us population turns out\nto be 37.5% of the increase in the total amount of residential land. A little algebra will show that\nthis is equivalent to our earlier back-of-the-envelope calculation, which divided the 17.8% increase\nin population by the 47.7% increase in residential land to obtain the same 37.3% contribution of\nchanges in us population.\nThe second component of the decomposition, P76us (l92us \u2212 l76us), represents the contribution of\nchanges in us residential land per person. This is how much the total amount of residential land in\nthe United States would have increased in the hypothetical case that us residential land per person\nhad grown as it did over the period 1976\u201392, (l92us \u2212 l76us), but that us population had remained\nconstant at its 1976 level, P76us . Again, plugging in the actual values, we find that the contribution\nof changes in us residential land per person is 53.2% of the actual increase in the total amount of\nresidential land.\nThe third component of the decomposition, (P92us \u2212 P76us)(l92us \u2212 l76us), represents the contribution\nof the interaction between changes in us population and changes in us residential land per person.\nIt accounts for the fact that the increased population is being housed at the new higher average\namount of residential land per person. The contribution of this interaction term is 9.5% of the\nactual increase in the total amount of residential land.\n5A discussion of technical issues concerning the exact form of the decomposition can be found in Appendix A.\n4\nThe shift in population within the United States\nThe 53.2% contribution of changes in us residential land per person seems large. One possible\nexplanation for this large increase in per-person land use is that new houses are much bigger than\nolder houses. We can certainly observe this trend in the average size of newly constructed houses.\nFor example, in 1992, the average floor area in new one-family houses was 2,095 square feet (195\nsquare meters), up from 1,700 square feet in 1976 (156 square meters) \u2014 the increase in the average\nlot size between 1976 and 1992 was much smaller, from 0.37 to 0.41 acres.6\nA fact that has received far less attention than changing house sizes, is the shift of population\ntowards areas where houses have traditionally been larger. This shift means that, even if people\nmoving into an area built houses that were similar in size to those of their new neighbors, they\nstill would tend to be larger than the houses they left behind.7 Table 1 shows levels and changes\nin land use and population for individual states.8 We can see that, for example, the three states\nexperiencing the largest percentage increases in population, Nevada, Arizona and Florida (108.9%,\n66.8% and 57.0% respectively) all had above average levels of residential land per person in 1976.\nThe case of Florida is particularly striking. Residential land use per person was over one and a\nhalf times the us average in 1976 and its population grew at a rate more than three times that of\nthe United States as a whole.9\nTo check whether these examples are representative of a general trend, we start by repeating\nour original decomposition, but now at the level of individual states and separating us-level\npopulation changes from the differential population changes experienced by each state as follows:\nP92s \u2212 P76s =\nP92us \u2212 P76us\nP76us\nP76s +\n(\nP92s \u2212 P76s\nP76s\n\u2212 P\n92\nus \u2212 P76us\nP76us\n)\nP76s .\nThe first term on the right-hand side, (P92us \u2212 P76us)P76s \/P76us , represents how much population in the\nstate would have increased if its population had grown at the same rate as total us population.\nThe second term is the difference with respect to the state\u2019s actual population change (positive if it\ngrew at a higher rate than total us population, negative otherwise). We then sum over all states to\n6These data refer to new single-family homes (completed) and are taken from the U.S Bureau of the Census Survey\nof Construction, C25 Annual. See http:\/\/www.census.gov\/const\/C25Ann\/sftotalmedavgsqft.pdf and http:\/\/www.\ncensus.gov\/const\/C25Ann\/malotsizesold.pdf\n7Of course, the pattern of moves is likely to be much more complicated than \u2018in-movers\u2019 building and occupying\nnew homes while existing residents live in the established housing stock.\n8While our decompositions could in principle be performed at the level of any spatial unit, when picking the\nappropriate spatial scale we face a tradeoff. Smaller spatial scales clearly give more detail. But at smaller spatial scales,\nmoves between areas may largely be driven by differences between the size of houses (and other characteristics of\nthe housing stock). For example, as couples have children they often move from downtown to the suburbs of the same\nmetropolitan area explicitly to increase the size of their house. In this case, it seems odd to attribute the resulting increase\nin residential land to population shifts between downtown and the suburbs when that shift is essentially driven by a\ndesire to increase land consumption per person. Instead, we want a spatial scale at which population movements are\nlargely exogenous to the differences in the per-person residential land consumption in different areas. We would argue\nthat us states and metropolitan areas are suitable candidates. Thus, we perform our decomposition first for states and\nthen (in section 5) for metropolitan areas.\n9In an earlier draft of this paper, tables 1 and 3 reported residential land per person in acres that, due to a coding\nerror, were 9 times larger than the correct magnitudes. This error only affected this particular column of these tables.\nIt did not affect the decompositions we perform or any other results. The relative magnitudes of land per person were\nalso correct. We are very grateful to a referee for pointing this out.\n5\nTable 1: State-level land use and demographic changes 1976\u201392\nState\n% growth\nresidential\nland\n1976\u201392\n% growth\nresidential\nland per\nperson\n1976\u201392\n% growth\npopulation\n1976\u201392\n% growth\nhousehold\nsize\n1976\u201392\nresidential\nland per\nperson\n1976 (sq.\nmeters)\npopulation\n1976\n(millions)\nhousehold\nsize\n1976\n(people)\nAlabama 26.8 14.1 11.2 \u221213.5 246.31 3.74 3.07\nArizona 56.1 \u22126.4 66.8 \u221211.3 389.09 2.35 3.02\nArkansas 87.3 68.1 11.4 \u221210.5 290.47 2.17 2.93\nCalifornia 47.5 4.4 41.2 0.5 262.47 21.93 2.86\nColorado 78.2 34.2 32.8 \u221212.0 337.79 2.63 2.92\nConnecticut 71.1 59.9 7.0 \u221211.5 301.86 3.09 3.01\nDelaware 20.5 2.8 17.2 \u221212.2 367.03 0.59 3.05\ndc 18.8 38.4 \u221214.2 \u22129.6 93.39 0.70 2.67\nFlorida 116.1 37.6 57.0 \u22128.3 555.79 8.70 2.75\nGeorgia 54.7 16.3 33.0 \u221211.6 333.79 5.13 3.09\nIdaho 40.7 12.5 25.0 \u22128.9 318.43 0.86 3.05\nIllinois 41.1 37.0 2.9 \u22128.3 243.92 11.36 2.97\nIndiana 39.0 31.6 5.6 \u221211.0 300.75 5.37 3.00\nIowa 76.1 81.5 \u22122.9 \u221211.2 294.04 2.90 2.92\nKansas 33.7 21.4 10.2 \u22128.8 419.92 2.30 2.87\nKentucky 36.9 28.4 6.6 \u221213.3 264.39 3.53 3.05\nLouisiana 50.1 38.2 8.6 \u221211.9 342.61 3.95 3.17\nMaine 32.4 16.5 13.6 \u221213.8 497.34 1.09 3.02\nMaryland 21.7 3.1 18.0 \u221211.4 297.98 4.17 3.07\nMassachusetts 45.0 38.3 4.9 \u221210.8 338.78 5.75 2.99\nMichigan 33.0 27.9 4.0 \u221212.4 271.22 9.12 3.08\nMinnesota 69.7 49.4 13.6 \u221212.3 296.24 3.96 3.01\nMississippi 62.1 50.2 8.0 \u221213.0 275.58 2.43 3.22\nMissouri 40.4 29.8 8.2 \u22129.7 315.31 4.82 2.88\nMontana 42.1 30.5 8.9 \u221212.1 291.02 0.76 2.94\nNebraska 9.7 5.4 4.0 \u221210.2 337.67 1.55 2.91\nNevada 130.5 10.4 108.9 \u22127.6 330.37 0.65 2.80\nN.

The figure is 37.3% and is identical to the contribution attributed to us population calculated\nfrom the first decomposition we performed above. This reflects the fact that, once again, this is an\naccounting identity, so the numbers are identical by definition. To see this, we can take the first\ncomponent in the richer decomposition and rearrange it to get the first component in our original\ndecomposition. Specifically:\n\u2211\ns\u2208us\nP92us \u2212 P76us\nP76us\nP76s l\n76\ns =\nP92us \u2212 P76us\nP76us\n\u2211\ns\u2208us\nP76s l\n76\ns = (P92us \u2212 P76us)\nL76us\nP76us\n= (P92us \u2212 P76us) l76us .\nThus, the difference between our first decomposition and this one is not how we account for\nthe contribution of the change in us population but instead is reflected in the fact that we now\nsplit what is left after accounting for this change into three components. The contribution of\ndifferential changes in states\u2019 population captures the consequences of states with different per-\nperson amounts of residential land experiencing different population growth rates relative to the\nus average. This component accounts for 6% of the actual increase in the total amount of residential\nland. The contribution of changes in residential land per person at the level of individual states\naccounts for 49.7% of the total change. The remaining 7% corresponds to interactions between\nchanges in population and changes in residential land per person at the level of individual states.\nIt is interesting to note two facts. First, the contribution of differential changes in states\u2019 popu-\nlation is positive (6%). This indicates that, as suggested by the examples picked from Table 1 and\ndiscussed above, population growth has been biased towards states with historically high levels\nof residential land per person (l76s ). That is, [(P92s \u2212 P76s )\/P76s \u2212 (P92us \u2212 P76us)\/P76us ]P76s , the difference\nbetween the state\u2019s actual population change and how much population in the state would have\nincreased if its population had grown at the same rate as total us population, is larger for such\nstates. This makes the contribution of differential changes in states\u2019 population positive.\nThe second fact that emerges from this more detailed decomposition is that the contribution\nof changes in residential land per person at the level of individual states is smaller than the\ncontribution of nationwide changes in land per person we found in the first decomposition (49.7%\n7\nversus 53.2%). This decreased contribution reflects two factors. First, some of this increase is\nnow attributed to the higher than average rates of population growth in states with higher than\naverage residential land per person. Second, states with historically high population levels (P76s )\nhave tended to have relatively small increases in residential land per person (l92s \u2212 l76s ). This tends\nto make the contribution of changes in residential land per person at the state level smaller. The\nmost prominent example of this is California, the most populous state, which experienced almost\nno increase in the amount of residential land per person between 1976 and 1992.\nFalling household sizes\nAs a final step we look in more detail at the determinants of changes in residential land per person.\nOne of the most significant demographic changes between 1976 and 1992 has been a fall in the\naverage household size from 2.97 to 2.69 people. See, for example, Jiang and O\u2019Neill (2007) for\nan overview of recent us evidence. This has had important consequences for land use because,\nas the average household size falls, the number of housing units occupied by a given population\nincreases. In fact, the 1.6% annual growth rate of the number of households between 1976 and\n1992 is identical to the 1.6% annual growth rate of total housing units recorded in the American\nHousing Survey between 1976 and 1993 (us Bureau of the Census, 1978, 1995).\nAs documented in, for example, Kobrin (1976), this fall in the average household size is the\ncontinuation of an extremely long term trend for the us and part of a more general trend for\nmany countries. See, for example, Kuijsten (1995). This decline is the result of several changes\nto both family and household formation patterns. For families, there has been a sharp decline\nin the percentage of households headed by married couples with children (from 40.4% in 1970 to\n27.9% in 1985), while the number of households headed by single parents has increased (from 5.1%\nto 7.9% over the same time period).10 These changes are driven by a variety of factors. Santi (1988)\nidentifies the most important as the rising age of first marriage, the increasing rates of marital\ndisruption and nonmarital fertility. The proportion of households headed by married couples\nwith children has also decreased as a result of the falling propensity of young adults to live with\ntheir parents. At the same time as these changes to family formation patterns, the proportions of\nsingle and other nonfamily households have also increased (from 18.7% in 1970 to 27.7% in 1985),\npartly due to an increase in the proportion of the population that is unmarried and childless (as the\nbaby boom cohort moves through the age distribution) and partly due to this group\u2019s increased\npropensity to live alone. The resulting decline in average household size suggests an interesting\nquestion: How much of the growth in land per person is due to individual households using more\nland on average and how much to the increase in the total number of households?11\nTo answer this question note first that residential land per person is equal to the product of\nresidential land per household and the ratio of households to people:\nlti \u2261\nLti\nPti\n=\nLti\nHti\nHti\nPti\n= htir\nt\ni ,\n10All figures on the changing distribution of households by type are taken from table 7 of Santi (1988).\n11The importance of differences across countries in the evolution of average household size have been emphasized\nby Liu, Dally, Ehrlich, and Luck (2003) in the context of resource consumption and biodiversity.\n8\nwhere\nHti \u2261 Households in location i at time t ,\nhti \u2261\nLti\nHti\n= Average residential land per household in location i at time t ,\nrti \u2261\nHti\nPti\n= Ratio of households to population in location i at time t .\nTaking this in to account, we can split the component of our decomposition that captures the\ncontribution of changes in states\u2019 residential land per person into three parts:\n\u2211\ns\u2208us\nP76s (l92s \u2212 l76s ) = \u2211\ns\u2208us\nP76s (h92s r92s \u2212 h76s r76s )\n= \u2211\ns\u2208us\nP76s (h92s \u2212 h76s ) r76s + \u2211\ns\u2208us\nP76s h\n76\ns (r92s \u2212 r76s ) + \u2211\ns\u2208us\nP76s (h92s \u2212 h76s )(r92s \u2212 r76s ) .\nThe first term on the right hand side, represents how much residential land per person would\nhave increased if the average residential land per household increased as it did between 1976 and\n1992, but the ratio of households to population had stayed fixed at its 1976 level. The second term,\nin contrast, represents how much residential land per person in the state would have increased\nif the land per household had remained fixed, but the ratio of households to population grew as\nit did. Finally, the third term represents the interaction between changing land per household\nand the changing ratio of households to population. Thus, these three terms capture the partial\ncontributions of changes in residential land per household, of changes in the ratio of households\nto population, and of interactions between these two changes.\nSubstituting this back into our decomposition, we get our final and most detailed state-level\ndecomposition of changes in residential land in the United States:\nL92us \u2212 L76us = \u2211\ns\u2208us\nP92us \u2212 P76us\nP76usn\nP76s l\n76\ns\n}\nContribution of changes in us population: 37.3%\n+ \u2211\ns\u2208us\n(\nP92s \u2212 P76s\nP76s\n\u2212 P\n92\nus \u2212 P76usn\nP76us\n)\nP76s l\n76\ns\n}\nContrib. of differential changes in states\u2019 population: 6%\n+ \u2211\ns\u2208usn\nP76s (h92s \u2212 h76s ) r76s\n}\nContrib. of changes in states\u2019 residential land per household: 24.5%\n+ \u2211\ns\u2208us\nP76s h\n76\ns (r92s \u2212 r76s )\n}\nContrib. of changes in states\u2019 household sizes: 22.6%\n+ \u2211\ns\u2208us\nP76s (h92s \u2212 h76s )(r92s \u2212 r76s ) + \u2211\ns\u2208us\n(P92s \u2212 P76s )(l92s \u2212 l76s )\n}\nContrib. of interactions: 9.6% .\nNote that changes in residential land per household and changes in household sizes contribute\nalmost equally to changes in residential land per person and, consequently, to the growth of\ntotal us residential land between 1976 and 1992. To summarize our findings, the most important\ncomponent in increasing residential land uses has been overall population growth, but larger\nhouses and the increasing number of households also play an important role.\n9\nTable 2: State-level decomposition of the growth in residential land 1976\u201392\nState\n% of the growth in\nresidential land\n1976\u201392\naccounted for by\nchanges in US\npopulation\ndifferential\nchanges in\nstates\u2019\npopulation\nchanges in\nstates\u2019\nresidential\nland per\nhousehold\nchanges in\nstates\u2019\nhousehold\nsizes\ninteractions\nAlabama 66.4 \u221224.8 \u22124.9 58.2 5.1\nArizona 31.8 87.4 \u221230.4 22.8 \u221211.5\nArkansas 20.4 \u22127.3 57.9 13.4 15.7\nCalifornia 37.5 49.3 10.4 \u22121.0 3.8\nColorado 22.8 19.2 23.1 17.4 17.5\nConnecticut 25.0 \u221215.3 58.5 18.2 13.5\nDelaware 86.9 \u22122.8 \u221247.5 67.6 \u22124.2\ndc 94.7 \u2212170.2 133.8 56.5 \u221214.8\nFlorida 15.3 33.8 22.6 7.8 20.5\nGeorgia 32.5 27.8 5.2 24.0 10.5\nIdaho 43.7 17.8 6.1 24.1 8.3\nIllinois 43.3 \u221236.2 62.4 22.1 8.3\nIndiana 45.6 \u221231.2 43.7 31.8 10.0\nIowa 23.4 \u221227.2 80.3 16.6 7.0\nKansas 52.9 \u221222.7 31.7 28.6 9.5\nKentucky 48.2 \u221230.2 30.8 41.4 9.8\nLouisiana 35.5 \u221218.3 43.3 27.0 12.4\nMaine 55.0 \u221212.9 1.3 49.5 7.2\nMaryland 82.0 0.9 \u221239.7 59.3 \u22122.5\nMassachusetts 39.5 \u221228.7 52.0 26.8 10.4\nMichigan 53.9 \u221241.9 36.5 42.9 8.5\nMinnesota 25.5 \u22126.0 44.4 20.2 15.9\nMississippi 28.7 \u221215.8 49.4 24.0 13.8\nMissouri 44.0 \u221223.9 42.6 26.6 10.6\nMontana 42.3 \u221221.2 34.9 32.8 11.2\nNebraska 183.4 \u2212141.8 \u221254.9 117.3 \u22124.0\nNevada 13.6 69.8 1.5 6.3 8.8\nN.

Decomposing changes in states\u2019 residential land use\nThe growth of total us residential land is the sum over all states of the growth in residential land\nin each state. Thus, the decomposition of us changes in residential land is the sum over all states\nof the same decomposition done at the state level. Table 2 lists the importance of the various\ncontributing factors for each individual state. Note the large heterogeneity across states in the\nrelative importance of each factor.\nA few comments and examples may help with the interpretation of the evidence presented\nin table 2. First, components other than the contribution of the change in us population can\nbe negative. A negative value for the differential change in states\u2019 population identifies states\nwhose population grew at a slower rate than the us average. This slower rate of population\ngrowth reduced the increase in residential land compared to what it would have been if the state\npopulation had grown at the rate of the United States, hence the negative contribution. The most\nextreme example is dc whose population decline of -14.2% during this period would have seen\nthe amount of residential land decrease by nearly 32% if that population decline had not been\noffset by other factors.12 Negative contributions for changes in residential land per household\nare markedly less common, but we can still identify 11 states where decreases in the amount of\nresidential land per household would have decreased the overall amount of residential land if,\nonce again, those changes had not been offset by other factors. Finally, only 1 state, California, saw\na negative contribution of household size to overall residential land, consistent with the fact that\nit was the only state to see an increase in household sizes during the time period of our study (see\nTable 1). As should be clear from the example of dc, the contributions of individual components\ncan be greater than 100% provided that they are offset by changes elsewhere. The most striking\nexample of this is New Mexico that would have seen larger increases in residential land per person\nthan the 13.9% increase actually recorded, if its fast growing population and decreasing household\nsize, had not been more than offset by marked decreases in the amount of residential land per\nhousehold.\n5. Metropolitan areas\nHaving studied the relative contributions of changing demographics versus changes in residential\nland per household for individual states, it is natural to repeat the exercise for individual metro-\npolitan statistical areas (msa\u2019s).13 Table 3 shows levels and changes in land use and population\nfor all msa\u2019s with a 1992 population over one million, while table 4 shows the results of the\ndecomposition.\n12To calculate the implied decrease in the amount of residential land, one reads off the 18.8% increase in residential\nland for dc from table 1 and multiplies it by the -170.2% contribution of differential changes in states\u2019 population read\noff from table 2.\n13Since metropolitan areas do not cover the entire land area of the United States, we cannot calculate a decomposition\nof us changes as the sum of msa-level decompositions like we did for us states.\n11\nTable 3: msa-level land use and demographic changes

for individual states, there is a large degree of heterogeneity across indi-\nvidual msa\u2019s. The results for Portland are most striking. Table 3 shows that residential land in\nPortland grew at only 2% over the period, the lowest rate of all msa\u2019s included in the table. Turning\nto table 4 we see that us average rates of population growth would have seen Portland residential\nland increase by nearly 20% (the 988.8% contribution of changes in us times the 2% increase in\nresidential land from table 3), with its faster differential rate of population growth contributing\na similar additional percentage increases. Falling household sizes would have exacerbated these\npopulation changes and contributed to a further 7 percentage point increase in the amount of\nresidential land. That this did not happen is down to the huge offsetting change in the amount of\nland per household which, everything else equal, would have decreased the amount of residential\nland by nearly 30% over the period. Of course, everything else was not equal and the overall\nincrease was the 2% that we mentioned at the start of this example. Other msa\u2019s were much less\nunusual. Minneapolis, in particular, is the closest we get to a \u2018representative\u2019 city.\nThe term \u2018urban sprawl\u2019 is commonly used to describe rapid urban expansion that outpaces\npopulation growth, but also to characterize development that is scattered over previously un-\ndeveloped areas as opposed to filling in gaps in already built-up areas. These two dimension\nof sprawl are completely different and should not be mixed up. To emphasize the difference,\nthe last column of table 3 reports the index of residential sprawl or \u2018scatteredness\u2019 developed in\nBurchfield et al. (2006). This index reports the mean share of undeveloped land in the square\nkilometer surrounding any residential development in the msa. As this number increases, houses\n14\nare separated from each other by more undeveloped land.\nFigure 1 shows a scatter plot of the scatteredness of 1976\u201392 development against the change\nin the amount of residential land per person for msa\u2019s with a 1992 population over one million.\nThe figure illustrates that there is no apparent relationship between the extent to which residential\nland has outpaced population growth and the scatteredness of recent residential development.\nBurchfield et al. (2006) and Glaeser and Kahn (2004) have also found that different dimensions of\n\u2018urban sprawl\u2019 tend not to be highly correlated. Our finding reinforces this conclusion.\nComparisons of scatteredness and residential land per person for particular cities are also in-\nteresting. While the decomposition of Portland\u2019s land consumption (table 4) shows clear evidence\nthat its famous land use controls are binding, residential land per person and the scatteredness of\nresidential development are both distinctly higher in Portland than in any of the four California\nmsa\u2019s listed in table 3, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego and San Francisco. In addition, while\ndevelopment in each of Florida\u2019s major msa\u2019s, Orlando, Tampa and Miami, is less scattered than\nall of the major California msa\u2019s, residential land per person in the Florida cities is generally much\nhigher than in the California cities.\n6. Conclusions\nOur decompositions reveal a much more complex picture than is often implicitly assumed in dis-\ncussions about the determinants of urban expansion. In particular, increasing per-household land\nuse, the factor that receives the most attention in discussions of this topic, only contributed about\n25% of the increase in residential land in the United States during our study period. Increasing\npopulation, falling household size and the shift of population across states all made significant\ncontributions to the increase in residential land. The latter two components in particular have not\nyet received the attention they deserve.\nReferences\nBurchfield, Marcy, Henry G. Overman, Diego Puga, and Matthew A. Turner. 2006.

A note on decompositions\nA central issue concerning the use of decompositions is that there are a large number of possible\ndecompositions that one could perform, a fact that is well known in the literature (Rose and Casler,\n1996, Oosterhaven and van der Linden, 1997, Dietzenbacher and Los, 1998). For example, in the\ntext, we decompose the change in the total amount of residential land in the United States between\n1976 and 1992 into three distinct components:\nL92us \u2212 L76us = P92us l92us \u2212 P76us l76us = (P92us \u2212 P76us) l76us + P76us (l92us \u2212 l76us) + (P92us \u2212 P76us)(l92us \u2212 l76us) . (a1)\n16\nWe could, alternatively, have decomposed the change as follows:\nL92us \u2212 L76us = P92us l92us \u2212 P76us l76us = (P92us \u2212 P76us) l92us + P92us (l92us \u2212 l76us)\u2212 (P92us \u2212 P76us)(l92us \u2212 l76us) . (a2)\nMathematically, there is no reason to prefer the former over the latter. However, the decom-\nposition that we use in the text has the desirable property that the interpretation of the terms is\nmore intuitive. For example, in the text, the first component tells us how much the total amount\nof residential land in the us would have increased in the hypothetical case that us population had\ngrown as it did over the period 1976\u201392, but that us residential land per person had remained\nconstant at its 1976 level, l76us. The first component of the alternative decomposition tells us how\nmuch the amount of residential land in the us has increased because us population grew as it did\nover the period 1976\u201392 with us residential land per person at its 1992 level. In some sense, both\nthese components give a measure of the contribution of population growth to developed land, but\nthe former provides an answer to the question \u201cwhat would have happened if we had prevented\nthe increase in land use per person over the period?\u201d which appears to be the main focus of interest\nin both the academic and policy debates. A similar argument applies for the second component\nrepresenting the change in land use per capita.\nA second issue relates to whether or not to report an interaction term. An alternative would be\nto use only two terms as follows:\nL92us \u2212 L76us = P92us l92us \u2212 P76us l76us = (P92us \u2212 P76us) l76us + P92us (l92us \u2212 l76us) . (a3)\nNote that, relative to equation (a1), the change in land use is multiplied by the end of period\npopulation rather than the beginning of period. As before, the first term captures the contribution\nof the increase in population. Now, however, the second term captures the effect of increasing land\nuse for the original population and the fact that additional population also consumes land at the\nnew higher land use per person. That is the second term absorbs the contribution of the interaction\nterm. One could call this total the \u201ccontribution of increased land use\u201d. Alternatively, one could\ntake (a1) and use end of period land use rather than beginning of period land use in the first term\nand allow that to absorb the contribution of the interaction term:\nL92us \u2212 L76us = P92us l92us \u2212 P76us l76us = (P92us \u2212 P76us) l92us + P76us (l92us \u2212 l76us) . (a4)\nOne could then call this total \u201cthe contribution of increased population\u201d. As the decision is\narbitrary, and as moving from the three term decomposition (including interaction) to the two term\n(excluding interaction) only involves adding components, we prefer to report the decompositions\nincluding interactions.\nA third issue relates to the fact that one could change the ordering of the decompositions.\nAgain, our justification here for choosing our specific ordering over any other is that we focus on\ndecompositions that highlight demographic and land use factors that are particularly meaningful\nand easy to interpret in light of current discussions about changing land use.\n17\nAtlanta\nBoston\nBuffalo\nCharlotte\nChicago\nCincinnati\nCleveland\nColumbus\nDallas\nDenver\nDetroit\nGreensboro\nHartford\nHouston\nIndianapolis\nKansas City\nLos Angeles\nMemphis\nMiami\nMilwaukee\nMinneapolis\u2212St. Paul\nNashville\nNew Haven\nNew Orleans\nNew York\nNorfolk Orlando\nPhiladelphia\nPhoenix\nPittsburgh\nPortland Rochester\nSacramento\nSalt Lake City\nSan Antonio\nSan Diego\nSan Francisco\nSeattle\nSt. Louis\nTampa\nWashington\u2212Baltimore\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\nSc\nat\nte\nre\nd\nne\nss\n o\nf 1\n97\n6\u2212\n92\n d\nev\nel\nop\nm\nen\nt\n\u221230 0 30 60 90\n% change in residential land per person\n"}
