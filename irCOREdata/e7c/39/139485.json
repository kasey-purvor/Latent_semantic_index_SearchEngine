One increasingly attributed\nsource is propaganda (see Powell, 1967), the \u2018propaganda of the deed\u2019 - physical violence\n- but also the audio-visual. Terrorism is a language of symbolic action: in the choice of\nthe victims, in the choice of terrorist act, the drama created and the various official\nresponses sought. We are in a new era, when the terrorist act does not simply speak for\nitself via its symbolism, but is amplified through a vast constellation of modern media.\nWe explore the symbolism inherent in the construction of specially selected Islamist\naudio-visual propaganda made available on the internet today and seek to access the\n\u2018meaning\u2019 of terrorist visualities through semiotic analysis, particularly using the\nPositioning Triad (Baines, Fill and Page, 2008) and the deconstruction technique\n(Derrida, 1967) to encourage a new thread of political marketing\/propaganda research.\nWe conclude that a common theme projected in our sample appears to be that of the West\nas permanent aggressor, with Muslims depicted as piously aggrieved for the wrongs done\nunto them.\nAccepted for publication, Marketing Theory, 2009\n2SELLING TERROR:\nTHE SYMBOLISATION AND POSITIONING OF JIHAD\nIntroduction\nIn this article, we argue that terrorism is a genre of symbolic communication; a deviant\nnew form of political marketing\/propaganda. The creation of symbolism is the key terror\nstrategy, now and in history. Terrorists have always sought targets which resonate with\nmeaning: terrorism is an imprecisely calibrated language of symbolic communication.\nTargets are carefully selected by their representational value and the message\ncommunicated. Moreover this imprecisely calibrated language of communication and\npersuasion has deep roots in history right through to the Anarchists, Fenian Brotherhood,\nSinn Fein, and the various national liberation groups right up to Al Qaeda itself today.\nBut the argument goes beyond this. We have not only, in Russian anarchist revolutionary\nBakunin\u2019s famous phrase, the propaganda of the deed, but, extra to this, the amplification\nof the deed: articulated through globalised electronic media. This new reality is a\npenumbra of communications and propaganda media, internet videos, text videos, audio\nrecordings and print publications. No terrorist group has spoken like this before; the\nprevious vocabulary of terror, for example, the terse IRA or ETA announcements about\nthe iniquities of British or Spanish colonialism, seem anachronistic. The point is no\nlonger solely the terror deed but the visual celebration of it. The symbolism exists at two\nlevels: 1) the deed itself and 2) the many ways in which electronic communication\nenhances and retails that deed to the global audience.\nThrough the evolution of terrorism into a deviant sub-branch of political marketing, we\nnow face a global insurrection, based on the core notion of an existential threat to the\nIslamic faith. The idea that terrorist organisations not only understand the importance of\nmedia but use it assiduously in their own especially branded communications is now\nunquestioned (see Kimmage, 2008). The media savvy Taliban in Afghanistan propagate\ntheir perspective using DVDs and audio\/video cassettes in different regions of the\ncountry using a team of press spokesmen (Coghlan, 2006). Certainly, the Taliban\nunderstand the 24\/7 news cycle, by distributing material to Al Jazeera in Qatar on a daily\nbasis, since they are 5 hours ahead of London and 10 hours ahead of Washington (Taylor,\n2003: 317).\nThe terrorist insurrection is not confined to one geographic locality or fed only by a series\nof local grievances, but takes its motivating force from global media. The implications of\nthis for global security are very serious. The article argues that nothing can really be done\nuntil the mediatised\/ marketing nature of the insurrection is thoroughly understood. We\nargue that while there are no simple solutions, a part of any solution must be the\ndevelopment of a counter-narrative, one as compelling as the deviant terrorist narrative,\nand sustained and refreshed also through global marketing channels. The threat is\nuniversal because not only Western countries are involved in counter-insurgency\noperations concerning disparate Islamist terrorist groupings; so are the governments of\nthe Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Russia, China, Somalia, Sudan, Morocco, Egypt,\n3Pakistan, India, and so on. We use the word terrorist because these groupings are mostly\nengaged in violent struggle against legitimate governments and their citizenry.\nOur theoretical perspective is that the ideology of the terrorist is embedded in these\nphysical and visual texts that they produce. The inference is that they must be understood:\nwhat drives the terrorists, what is their worldview, their version of reality? While\northodox marketing ideology resides in the notion of customer focus, in the case of\nterrorism we have a different issue; the motives, the understandings, of the producer are if\nanything more significant than their impact on the consumer, reversing the normative\ntruths of marketing. It is the message that they are selling, their positioning that we\nshould seek to understand. So the focus must be on producer as well as on consumer.\nThe Symbolism Of The Deed\nThe difficulty arises in determining exactly what it is that terrorists want to say. Firstly,\nthere is the outrageous nature of the atrocity itself, the register of the depth of hatred.\nAnother symbolically-enunciated message is that the state cannot protect you, and in the\ncase of the Al Qaeda, the humiliation of the Superpower. Bin Laden himself described\nthe events of 9-11 symbolically when he proclaimed: \u201cThese young men... Said in deeds\nin New York and Washington, speeches, that overshadowed all other speeches made\neverywhere else in the world. These speeches are understood by now by Arabs and non-\nArabs -- even by Chinese\u201d (Anon., 2001).\nThe innocence of the victims of the atrocities is also deliberate, the fact there is no\ndiscrimination and the victims, says the symbolism, are people exactly like yourselves,\nnot the elites but the ordinary mass, who can be stuck anywhere, any time. So terrorism\nemerges as a symbolic language of persuasion. Other aspects of this symbolic language\ninclude the arousal of public thirst for revenge, so authorities will be persuaded into a\ngrossly disproportionate retaliatory act, which serves to radicalise the tepid and latent\npopular support for the terrorists in their base.\nRichardson (2006) endows terrorism with an historical pedigree, via three case studies-\nthe Zealots of ancient Judea, the Assassins of the medieval middle-east, and the\nThuggees, worshippers of the goddess Kali via ritual murder. In all these cases, it was in\nthe meaning of the deed symbolically that counted, the choice of victims, the occasion\nwhen the deed was perpetrated, the manner of its publication and the message sent to the\nbroader community as well as the specific targets among leadership cadres. In other\nwords, the core of the terrorist act was symbolism, not instrumentalism. In no sense can\nthese deeds be seen as making either an independent Jewish nation more possible, or a\npure Islamic regime on earth or the extension of the power of the goddess Kali. But a\nrational calculus played no part in their planning, what mattered was intrinsic meaning\nand public visibility.\nYet there are fashions in terrorism. For example in the 1970s and 80s, hijacking became\nmore popular, such as the hijacking of TWA flight 847 allegedly by Hezbollah\noperatives, and the hijacking by the PLO of the Achille Lauro ocean liner. The attraction\nwas the ability to create an unfolding narrative. The terrorists extract from such scenarios\n4every ounce of drama as the crisis is perpetuated in the full glare of global media. They\nwere a media production, with real props and real people. Effective use of symbolism in\nterror was also deployed by the Zionist terror organisations Irgun and the Stern gang,\nwhich were active in the last years of the British mandate in Palestine. Assassination was\nan important weapon, killing both Lord Moyne, a member of Churchill's Cabinet, and UN\nHigh Commissioner Count Bernadotte. Or massacre: the elimination in 1948 by the Irgun\nof the Palestinian village of Dir Yassin with the deaths of 254 innocent villagers. The aim\nwas simple, to symbolically articulate the impossibilities of the continuity of British rule.\nThe victims chosen were those likely to resonate most with the ultimate target, British\npublic opinion, to make it tire of the conflict and dream of release. For example two army\nsergeants were kidnapped and found hanging. The terrorists\u2019 biggest achievement was the\nblowing up of the King David hotel in Jerusalem in 1948, which was the headquarters of\nthe British rule: over 90 people, Arab, British and Jew, were murdered in that event.\nAlgeria represents the first theatre of modern terrorism, since it was the first time\nterrorists integrated a propaganda assault, which was global in its object, alongside\nterrorist acts. Radio Free Algiers broadcast from Egypt throughout the Middle East, while\nthe independence movement, the FLN, sponsored propaganda on a global scale,\nparticularly in the US, with exhibitions and images of alleged French atrocities. One\nparticular convert was Senator John Kennedy (Horne 2006). The FLN established the\nprinciple of duality, the bomb and the text. The bombings of the centre of Algiers city,\nusing women bombers, so famously depicted in the film \u2018The Battle of Algiers\u2019, was in\nfact a good example of the significance of targets symbolism: these included the Air\nFrance offices, and the milk bar full of French teenagers dancing. The aim of FLN\nstrategy in Algeria, was to provoke a brutal French counter-reaction. This they achieved,\nwith the effect of radicalising all public opinion in Algeria: the French had won the battle\nof the Kasbah but ultimately lost the war.\nTerrorists look for symbol-rich targets, often places of transience and inter-cultural\nmixing such as Bali or Luxor. The symbols and symbolic targets are often those least\nlikely to be involved in any active oppression of the terrorist's supporters. The bomb\nscene, the massacre, are the texts, for example, the 1987 Northern Ireland Remembrance\nSunday bombing at Enniskillen, the 9-11 bombs in America, 2002 Moscow theatre\nmassacre, the 2002 Bali bombings in Indonesia, and more recently, the 2004 Madrid train\nbombs and the 2005 London tube and bus bombs. The point about such events is that they\ndeliberately seek to violate every value and every social norm of every culture, and they\nsucceed: what could be more pitiful than the massacre of hundreds of schoolchildren at\nBeslan in Russia by Chechnyan terrorists? Hence in terrorism, the symbol is the victim,\nand terrorists particularly seek out victims who are rich in symbolic meaning: according\nto Crelinston (1989), \u201cthe selection of victims is symbolic and instrumental... The victim\nis chosen because of whom he or she represents and because their victimisation will\nresonate with specific audiences\u201d. Other commentators also recognize the inherent\nsymbolic propaganda power in terrorist acts, for example, Blain (1988) concludes\n\u201chuman violence is \u2026 an extreme expression of symbol-mindedness\u201d. But the question\narises as to who is victim because the process of suicide bombing is also self-\nvictimization. In other words, there is a double victim, the target and the suicide-bomber.\n5Suicide bombing itself is a highly ritualistic event, with a film made of the bomber\nwearing a bandanna, making homage to God, saying farewell and articulating a highly\npoliticised polemic. There is no military need here. What matters is the meaning of the\nself detonation. It arouses admiration in the latent supporters of the movement because by\ndefinition self-murder is the ultimate sacrifice. It legitimates the act of murder or mass\nmurder through joining the mayhem as victim as well as perpetrator. So, it eludes the\ncharge of cowardice since although it is clearly cowardly to attack innocent civilians, to\njoin them in death at the very point of their murder negates the accusation.\nThe Symbolisation Of The Visual Image\nWe have suggested that the point about the Internet and global television channels is that\nthey incentivise terror by significantly increasing the ability to retail terror imagery. Al\nQaeda is coterminous with the arrival of global media, especially in the form of satellite\ntelevision (e.g. Al Jazeera) and the Internet replete with images of Bin Laden and Al\nZawahiri. Persuasion can resort to symbolism alone, without any other kind of rationale.\nThis is particularly relevant in the context of the video products of Al Qaeda: a symbol\nhas the flexibility of meaning to which the viewer can bring his or her own imagination.\nBut the reverse is not possible, for example, \u201ca propaganda bereft of symbol structures\nwould be unintelligible as propaganda. Symbols telegraph meaning, and life is\nconstructed around symbols, since they are mental heuristics or shortcuts through which\ndaily life is interpreted and organised\u201d (O'Shaughnessy, 2004).\nPositioning Intentions And Semiotics\nDetermining what propagandists and marketers alike are trying to say in their\ncommunications is seldom simple because communications so frequently contain\nambiguous symbols and messages. Communication can be broken into three separate\ncomponents, comprising the text of the communication, what symbols were projected\nfrom that text, and how a symbol is culturally interpreted (see Peirce, 1931-58). We can\nperceive this triadic relationship as a three-way interaction between what we call the Item\n\u2013 that which we are communicating something about, the Symbol \u2013 what we intend to\ncommunicate about the Item, and the Meaning, the interpretation of the symbol within a\ncultural context in order to understand how communicators might try to position the Item\nand equally how that Item might end up being interpreted by the audience (Baines, Fill\nand Page, 2008). Pulling these three items together gives us The Positioning Triad (see\nFigure 1) \u2013 a tool to provide us with a clearer understanding of the two-way nature of the\npositioning process. While many in marketing regard positioning as how to formulate a\nmessage in advertising, the original proponents of the concept (Ries and Trout, 1972)\nview the process as one of what you do to the mind of a prospect. Positioning is therefore\nboth a function of what is transmitted as well as what is received. The former requires the\nuse of semiotics to decode intended and unintended meanings whilst the latter requires\nthe use of orthodox market research. In commerce, semiotic analysis of competitor\nadvertising has been particularly useful in understanding what messages an advertiser\nintends to convey, and how they are interpreted within the consumers\u2019 cultural milieu\n(see Harvey and Evans, 2001, for the example of Guinness). Such an approach could\neasily be applied to the analysis of terrorist positioning strategy, and to our knowledge is\nyet to be. We argue that if we can decode the Items (\u2018Texts\u2019) that the propagandist\n6projects, then we can decode their positioning strategy and thus their intentions. With\ntraditional market positioning studies (which question audiences on how they perceive\nsomething), we do not necessarily see how the company is trying to position itself\n(intended positioning); what we see instead is how the company actually ends up\npositioned in the mind of customers (\u201cthe Meaning\u201d); two different concepts entirely (see\nFigure 1). In any event, terrorists are unlikely to tell us the positioning strategies they\nemploy and their effectiveness.\nApproaches to semiotic analysis include the use of the linguistic technique of\ndeconstruction, associated with French philosopher Jacques Derrida. In deconstruction,\nwe aim to revisit what the Item is trying to convey by looking at gaps, inconsistencies and\n\u2018absences\u2019 within the communication (Derrida, 1967). The approach employs subjective\ntextual analysis which breaks the communication down into privileged themes (i.e. those\nthemes which are clearly advanced in the text), then determines \u2018binary opposites\u2019 (e.g.\nman\/woman, white\/black, right\/wrong) of those privileged themes as the hidden or absent\nmeaning of the work, and essentially proposes that this is what that work is really trying\nto say.\nFigure 1: The Positioning Triad\nSymbol\nItem Meaning\nIntended Positioning\n(Projected\nCommunications)\nCultural\nInterpretation\nActual Positioning\nSource: Adapted from Baines, Fill and Page (2008)\nThe semiotic approach has previously been used in marketing to analyse advertising\n(Scott, 1992; Stern, 1996; Proctor et al, 2001). The Positioning Triad (above) seeks to\nexpose the gap between intentional and unintentional positioning in communications, and\nthus charts a basis for preparing riposte, or counter-attack to, in this case, terrorist\npropaganda. This work is an extension of previous work undertaken by the authors into\nexamining how British Muslims respond to Islamist video-polemic (Baines et al, 2006).\nThe focus however now moves to the interplay between the cultural interpretation and the\n7intended positioning components (i.e. interpreted through the communication\nmessages\/media used) of the Positioning Triad in Figure 1. Rather than assessing the\nimpact of the clips on the subjects that watch them, instead we assess the semiotic\nstrategy of the authors; i.e. to interrogate what their intentions were in devising the kinds\nof clips that they did. We note, however, that by using the term intended positioning, we\nare referring specifically to the themes and symbols Islamists are actually projecting\nrather than the messaging they meant to project. To identify the latter, one would actually\nhave to interview the Islamist propagandists themselves, which is an unlikely possibility.\nMethodological Approach\nOur exploration of Jihadist video-clips using semiotics is an \u2018outside-in\u2019 approach,\n\u201casking how things get into people\u2019s heads in the first place\u201d (Lawes, 2002), to determine\nhow Islamist polemicists might project their communications; that is to the interplay\nbetween the intended positioning used and the cultural interpretation components of the\nPositioning Triad. We chose four audio-visual clips, especially selected from a thousand\nor so on the www.memritv.org website (see Table 1) for semiotic analysis. They were\njudgmentally selected on the basis of genre (e.g. newsreader format, cartoon, talking head\nmartyr\/revenge, atrocity depiction), and they are not entirely representative of their\ncategory, for we did not systematically assess them on a random basis. To take and\nanalyse specific communications is a common approach in semiotic analysis. Rather our\nwork is qualitative, seeking to highlight a phenomenon worthy of new research; namely\nhow to derive the positioning intentions of terrorists when developing their\ncommunications, including the acts of violence themselves. We acknowledge that the\nclips seek multiple audiences; aiming at both a Muslim Western audience (to convert and\nrecruit) and non-Muslim Western audience (to taunt and sap morale), in addition to\nMiddle Eastern Muslim audiences (to unify and integrate). We used one specific medium,\naudio-visual clips available on the internet, because this has become the medium of\nchoice for many terrorist groups, in particular Al-Qaeda (see Kimmage, 2008).\nTable 1: Selected Terror Tapes\nCLIP DESCRIPTION BROADCASTER DATE OF\nBROADCAST\nDIFFUSION\nSOURCE LENGTH\n1 A bridegroom turns into a suicide\nbomber in an Iranian TV music\nvideo\nbroadcast by\nIRIB\/Jamm-E-Jam3\n(Iran)\n28th October 2005 Iran 3 mins 25\nsecs\n2 Palestinian Children clash with an\nIsraeli soldier in an Iranian\nanimated movie\nBy IRIB\/Jamm-E-\nJam 1 (Iran)\n28th October 2005 Iran 2 mins\n3 Mohammed Sadiq, one of the\nsuicide bombers who carried out\nthe London bombings in a video-\ntaped message: \u201cOur words are\ndead until we give them life with\nour blood\u201d\nAl-Jazeera TV\n(Qatar)\n1st September 2005 Al Qaeda 2 mins 27\nsecs\n4 Al-Qaeda Internet news broadcast\ncelebrates U.S. hurricanes and Gaza\npullout, reports Zirqawi\u2019s Anti-\nShiite campaign and chemical\nmortar shells in Iraq\nThe Internet Earliest recorded\naccessibility,\nSeptember 2005\nAl Qaeda 4 mins 56\nsecs\n8Analysis of Selected \u2018Jihadi\u2019 Clips\nClip 1: Suicide Bomber at Israel Checkpoint in Iranian Pop Music Video Format\nCore analysis: Symbolism of pop cultural convention is created and then sabotaged,\nemploying it as a Western counter-symbol to emancipate martyrdom\nPositioning: This clip aims to inculcate its audience with a sense of grievance and the\nselflessness and piety of suicide bombing, making it an acceptable act or at least one that\ncan be condoned.\nSymbolisation: the stylistic convention resonates with MTV and Western consumer\nadvertising. The viewer is first deliberately deluded into thinking this is a pop video or\nconsumer advertisement. Boy and girl gaze lovingly at each other and what sounds at first\nto be ostensibly popular Iranian music is played, yellow ribbons are placed on the car. Is\nthis a wedding? The soft-focus conventions, the sexiness, the sentimentality are all\napparent, but we are to discover that this is not Western pop fantasy; it is glorification of\nsuicide-murder. The Iranian pop music contributes to our perplexity, associating with a\nmood of relaxation\/indulgence, but not martyrdom (yet). It is only when we see that he\nhas left his \u2018bride\u2019 to drive towards a military checkpoint that we know something is\namiss. Parting with the beautiful young \u2018bride\u2019 is symbolic of what the young man will\nleave on this earth. Given the strict restrictions placed on music video by Iranian censors,\nand the messages they contain, the MTV style formatting is surprising but represents a\nparody of Western-style culture and allows the message to be presented in a less obvious\nmanner. The play on pop music\/wedding sentimentality pokes fun at Western ideals.\nYouth is the target audience, and thus there is also, perhaps contradictorily, an anxiety to\nappear modern. The tape is also highly ritualistic, i.e. symbolic performance, and contains\na cacophony of recherch\u00e9 symbols e.g. paper butterflies.\nMeaning: the emancipation of martyrdom is conveyed through a medium ordinarily\nassociated with popular Western entertainment. The key objective of this strategy is to\nhonour the kamikaze idea; life and death are juxtaposed with death, intending to make it\nacceptable, indeed desirable and beyond worldly associations (e.g. marriage). The\nmeaning is secular\/political and not religious; in fact, perhaps ironically, no overt\nmention of God is made.\nClip 2: Palestinian Children Versus Israeli Soldier in Iranian Cartoon Illustrating\nthe Biography of a Suicide Bomber\nCore analysis: This clip is structured round four clear symbolic appeals which\ncollectively give it meaning and narrative momentum which seek to both explain\nand emancipate matyrdom\nPositioning: This clip identifies Iranian perspectives on the Middle East: 1) identification\nof Israel as the target, 2) belief in the value of fomenting violence and civil unrest among\nPalestinians, 3) the suggestion of a proxy war with Israel. 4) Israel is viewed as Uncle\n9Sam's colony and puppet. The two are the same entity, the relationship of monkey and\norgan-grinder. The Iraqi cartoon is a version of the massacre of the innocents which has\nalways been powerful as propaganda throughout time. The concept of children as the\nvictims of war arouses both our guilt as war perpetrators and rage as war fighters.\nSymbolism: The first symbol is that of David versus Goliath: The cartoon is based on the\nsymbolism of a core myth in Western culture. The direct biblical referent transcends the\nbiblical since this myth is one of few which has migrated from specific to universal\nculture. It is the tale of the fighting underdog. Myths must have intuitive plausibility for\nacceptance, i.e. some relationship with the memory of the collectivity that fashions it.\nUnlike some of the clips reviewed, this one is not outr\u00e9, and the producers have gone out\nof their way to make an explicitly Western media product, the children in the cartoon are\nwestern in dress, and they are white. The second symbol is that of America\u2019s nefarious\nomnipresence: The cyborg-like Israeli splits open to reveal Uncle Sam, the true enemy in\nthe video; in fact quite literally, the enemy behind the enemy. The third symbol is that of\nenemy not as human but as a robotic killing machine. The story begins with children\nthrowing stones at Israeli troops, one of whom advances menacingly towards them. Their\npathetic little rocks are powerless against the Israeli giant, who proceeds to machine-gun\nthe lot of them. This is no person but a vicious, unfeeling cyborg, his face seems made\nnot of skin but of steel. The fourth symbol is that of justified revenge: the remaining boy,\ninfuriated and grief-stricken, picks up a sling, inserts a stone and lobs it at the advancing\ncyborg who reels, cracks open and behind him is revealed the moribund figure of Uncle\nSam.\nMeaning: this is successfully conveyed and done at one remove, i.e. indirectly through a\nmedium ordinarily associated with childrens\u2019 entertainment. The explicit indicators of\npropaganda are missing; the viewer is cleverly seduced into acceptance through the\ncartoon format application.\nClip 3: Mohammed Sadiq Khan\u2019s 7-7 Al-Qaeda Martyrdom Video\nCore analysis: a cacophony of different and even contradictory symbols are used in\nan attempt to terrify Western audiences into believing the enemy is within\nPositioning: This text is a sermon of revenge with Mohammed Sadiq self-cast as the\nagent of retribution, a harbinger of justice through his ultimate act of self-murder. What is\nintentional is that this is a message from a dead man, who knew exactly what he was\ndoing. The tape is a necessary symbol of the act, the drama, integrated with the self-\ndetonation and articulating its precise meaning (the notion of just retribution is very\nprevalent in all Al Qaeda propaganda).\nSymbolism: The clips are all about symbolizing martyrdom in one way or another. Sadiq\nimitates Palestinian suicide bombers in the Intifada, and their formal ritualised farewell\nwherein the martyr-elect declaims histrionically his reasoning behind becoming a martyr\nand denounces the targets of his self-detonation. The effects of this tape are in the main\nincongruous. A message, any message, as a semiotic system has intentional and\nunintentional components (see Figure 1). It gives a meaning, but it also gives off a tone\n10\nwhich might be at variance with that meaning. The Jihadi delivers his lines in a broad\nYorkshire accent, which carries a set of class and regional associations, independent of\nthe context in which it is used. Sadiq\u2019s strong Yorkshire accent serves as a reminder that\nhe is one of us. The context may be global Muslim Jihad, but what is given off is the\npersona of an infuriated Yorkshire plebeian (perhaps the real truth of the situation). The\ntotality of this symbolic system is incoherent, Yorkshire accent, Islamic dress, suicidal\nbandana, and praise for his mentors. The vocabulary of Muslim reverence, specifically\nthe duah which this suicide bomber proffers to Allah, is so much at variance with the\nviolent and essentially political nature of the message. As a persuasive performance this\nis not successful, given the character projected and, specifically, what we recognize as a\nbullying persona, displayed with finger-stabbing rhetoric.\nHere also the rhetoric assumes a default-symbolic character. The verbalisation is, like the\nangry physical tone, somewhat anachronistic with its sub-Marxian reference, for example\nto \u2018the masses\u2019, the jargon of old agitation propaganda (see Ellul, 1973)1. But this\ncombines with the postmodernist language of cultural criticism, e.g. the concepts of spin\nand discourse. A veneer of pseudo-education frames the presentation.\nThe symbol of an educated man, at least to some extent, was embodied in the language he\nused that revealed some articulative capability and conceptual awareness; combined with\nvarious symbols of the imminent deed, or what have come to be prescribed as the\nPalestinian-defined rituals of the suicide video, such as the bandanna with Arabic script.\nThe intended implication is that terrorists are clever, and resourceful, and so must be\nfeared.\nMeaning: in this clip, we are introduced to a martyr after his act of self-detonation in an\nattempt to invoke fear amongst Western audiences. The aim is to taunt Western audiences\nand possibly to entice British Muslims to undertake similar acts and\/or condone his act.\nIn particular, there is an attempt to display suicide-murder as a rational act displaying the\nhighest religious piety but what is likely to come across instead is the hysterical nature of\nhis act and the mismatch of his Islamist stance with his Yorkshire background.\nClip 4: Al-Qaeda Internet \u2018News Broadcast\u2019 Featuring Zirqawi\nCore analysis: a conventional symbol of western mediatized discourse is turned into\na counter- symbol; a familiar domestic medium becomes hijacked, charged with the\nenergy of enmity\nPositioning: This is the world according to Al-Qaeda, functioning as an attempt to\nprovide an alternative news perspective to the typical Western media product. Praise is\nlarded on Al-Zirqawi for his resistance in Iraq, scorn is poured on Shiites as\n1 Propaganda specialists tend to refer to agitation propaganda \u2013 agitprop \u2013 as propaganda aimed at\nfomenting dissent and encouraging revenge, race or hate attacks \u2013 and integrationist propaganda \u2013\nintegprop - aimed at building a cohesive group identity, e.g. encouraging nationalism (see Bernays, 1942;\nEllul, 1973). The Nazi propaganda of the 1930\/40s contained elements of both since it encouraged German\nimperialism and hatred of Jews, Gypsies and many other social groups.\n11\ncollaborators. There is gloating over Katrina with film clips illustrating Allah's\nvengeance; all Americans are objectified as enemy. There is a specific attempt to\njuxtapose a military side of Al-Qaeda with that of a news organization, attempting to\nlegitimate the aims of their organization even though these aims are not explicitly\noutlined.\nSymbolism: This clip also symbolises the positionioning Al Qaeda as a virtual nation with\nits own national television news (complete with balaclavas). These \u2018newsreaders\u2019 not\nonly read the news, but intersperse film clips from various parts of the world, as in any\nconventional news formatting. This suggests, quite deliberately, the globalisation of Al\nQaeda\u2019s reach and perspective. This \u2018newsreader\u2019 format gives any non-target viewers a\njolt: since it is their perspective on western society that is challenged, but using western\nsymbol systems. this Al-Qaeda communication is replete with symbol-larded texts. What\nis remarkable abut this clip is the contemporaneity of its stylistic posture, the graphics\nflash and morph in the attempt to impress with technological sophistication, terrorism as\nBrand X. The image and the overall impression is: ritual incantations, darkened\nbackgrounds, golden sword motifs; for viewers who have not been schooled in these\nsymbol systems the impression is distinctly other-planetary, the feeling of having\nencountered a parallel and deeply mysterious universe. The voice and music, the sound\nproduced, low and long, almost a protracted hum, the chant-like incantation seem\nportents of doom for the enemy West. And just to refresh our memory, the clip ends with\nall those slogans and brand identifiers again, revealing a self-conscious understanding of\nthe role of symbolism and imagery as meaning signifiers and identity-definers in a media\nage.\nMeaning: What is probably unintentional is the surrealist nature of this clip, which\nacquires something of the quality of a spoof. Suddenly a news-reader with a masked face\npops up, dressed in a black t-shirt with big arms. The incongruity effect is such that the\nwhole event appears as mimicry, a pastiche of the rituals of western media.\nExplaining Terror\nLeading commentators have speculated on just how effective the visual polemics are as a\ntool for proselytisation, the effectiveness of these clips is likely to vary according to\ntarget group and they may not be provoking the reactions they intend since there are\ndramaturgic failings, symbolic incongruities and unintended readings. Clearly terrorist\norganisations themselves think they are effective: the visibility of their self-created\nimagery surfaces frequently on mainstream media and viewing these images is a ritual of\ninitiation (Razzaque, 2008).\nIt is quite possible to argue that the entire media product of Al Qaeda is irrelevant to their\nsuccess in so far as they have succeeded. Firstly, it may well be that potential terrorists\nrespond to the same public media, CNN, as the rest of the public, but they react to those\nimages of death and destruction in a different way. It becomes a question then of self-\nsubversion, rather than other directed subversion via globally retailed terrorist image\nnetworks. Self persuasion is particularly important here - for example, Omar Sheikh, the\nmurderer of American journalist, Daniel Pearl, was radicalised by a video about Bosnia\n12\nthat he watched when studying at the London School of Economics; a socialization\nprocess followed by the 7-7 bombers, according to psychiatrist, Razzaque (2008). It is\nprobably the case that the real triggers to radicalisation lie in this socialisation occurring\nwithin intimate groups but these groups use such stimulus material to aid in their\nsubjects\u2019 mutual radicalisation.\nThe thesis advanced by Richardson (2006) suggests that terrorists, far from lacking\nhuman sympathy, suffer from an excess of it but choose to direct it in perverse and\nexclusionary ways. Terrorists inhabit a manichean world, they crave a clear bogeyman to\ndestroy, they desire a simple explanation, which will take them through the transition\nfrom latent desire to active participation. It is here that the message, rhetoric and\nsymbolism of Al Qaeda are particularly significant, for what Al Qaeda offers is a\ncoherent world view, or what the Nazis described as Weltschaung. Thus, it is the\ncoherence of the Al Qaeda vision that is the important selling point, a simplistic, unitary\nexplanation of ostensibly disparate phenomena and the irrational arguments of Islamist\npropaganda therefore directly appeal, e.g. the supposed existence of a global conspiracy\nagainst Islam, an existential threat created by the West to the future of their religion. This\nexplanation hangs together, it has an inner logic since some half-dozen recent\ninternational crises and conflicts (Chechnya, Palestine, Kashmir, Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo)\nindeed have Muslims as the victims and losers. This inference, from universal victimhood\nto universal conspiracy, is the core of Al Qaeda and all of its strategies are directed\ntowards communicating this simple message, both rhetorically and symbolically.\nFurther Research and Conclusions\nIn this article, our aim has been to begin to document the phenomenon of Islamist\npropaganda and deconstruct some of the arguments and symbolization used to position\nthe messaging either to unite audiences against a common Western enemy (the Iranian\nclips), to taunt and sap the will of Western audiences (the Al Qaeda newscast and Sadiq\nclips) and\/or to recruit Western Muslims to the Islamist cause (the Sadiq video in\nparticular) in a small selected sample of communications. We argue that further research\nshould be conducted into this new, but burgeoning, field of political\nmarketing\/propaganda, to identify a wider array of common positioning themes aimed at\ntarget audiences to build on the work outlined here. We need to identify how terrorist\nmedia from a wide variety of organizations are intentionally positioning their message of\nhatred and Jihad, and how the images and rhetoric they associate with these messages\nresonate amongst their different target audiences, particularly those from different\nMuslim sub-cultures in Western countries who are arguably more susceptible to such\nmessaging and symbolisation. In this work, our intention has not been to definitively\nidentify how Islamist propagandists position their communications, instead it has been to\nidentify how they might be trying to do this. Further research is necessary to determine\nwhether the approaches identified in this paper are common across a representative\nsample of Islamist propagandist communications, by region, by group, and by time\nperiod.\nWe conclude that it seems prima facie absurd to speak of terrorist positioning and\nmarketing strategy when the market is death and destruction. But we would advance a\n13\nnumber of significant qualifications. Firstly, although marketing has one definition and\ncorpus of knowledge, there is a public and vernacular concept of marketing, and\nespecially the language of marketing, which has become a language of public and media\ndiscourse. Secondly, although the concept of terrorism as marketing, terrorism as a\nlanguage of symbolic communication, would not sustain an orthodox marketing analysis,\nnot least because there is no two-day dialogue, there is no doubt that terrorists a) have\ntarget markets, b) use communications prodigiously to the extent that these matter now\nfar more than the actual terror act itself, c) access channels of distribution, and d) have a\nmarket differentiation strategy. There can at least be said to exist in a metaphoric sense,\nthe ubiquitous marketing mix of product, place, price, promotion in terrorist political\nmarketing\/propaganda. Perhaps all that is absent at present is the commission of opinion\nresearch and the reformulation of communication material based on test audience\nreaction. But the question that arises is for how long with this amateur approach persist?\nJust because the political marketing\/propaganda used currently is relatively ineffective in\nWestern countries \u2013 given the limited successful episodes of suicide bombing\u2013 though\nmuch more successful in Iraq and Afghanistan \u2013 this does not mean we should not study\nit. We can be sure that terrorist groups will learn and refine their techniques as they gain\nincreasing media experience and are able to translate material which succeeds in\nrecruiting and radicalising Iraqis and Afghanis to recruiting Western Muslims and\nMuslim converts.\nTo understand terror, and to combat terrorism, we must realise that it is per se a form of\ncommunication, and that Al Qaeda, in particular has always recognized this. A leftist\nview has conventionally been that it is speech of the excluded, of the powerless. This is a\nlegitimate perspective. But it is important to qualify this by saying that the sense of\ngrievance, and therefore the very foundation of terror, can be talked into almost any\ngroup. In other words, revenge-action can be positioned. Our thesis is that the desire to\nkill can, and is, actively being positioned by media savvy terrorist groups2. Therefore, we\nmust not delay in researching how and when such symbolization and positioning\nresonates and how it can be neutralized through counter-narrative.\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors would like to thank MEMRITV.org for making available copies of the\nrelevant clips used in this research.\nReferences\nAnon.
