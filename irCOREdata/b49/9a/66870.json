we also have to think of ourselves beyond the cosmopolitan+\nThe first section of this article examines in more detail the theoretical issues\njust raised to argue for an anthropological constructivism to supplement sociolog-\nical constructivism+ The next two sections analyze essential notions of nation-\nstate and diaspora to show how overseas Chinese have been crucial in the production\nof Chinese and Thai nationalism+ The second section thus shows how overseas\nChinese are used not just as a financial resource in China to fund revolutions in\nthe past and economic reforms in the present; they have been an important sym-\nbolic resource in the construction of Chinese nationalism+ The third section exam-\nines how diasporic Chinese have been crucial in the construction of Thai national\n5+ Appadurai 1996, 158+\nChinese Diaspora in China and Thailand 483\nidentity, first as the foreign Other, and more recently as promoters of a more in-\nclusive Thai neo-nationalism+\nThe fourth section highlights how the diaspora uses the same logic of the rela-\ntions of difference to form a set of new communities and thus new borders in\nThailand+ Though they may seem national, one should be clear that these borders\nare not the juridical-legal territorial borders of the nation-state+ They are the eco-\nnomic and cultural borders of various communities in the national center of Bang-\nkok, the transnational node of Phuket, and the rural Mahasarakham province+ The\nethnographies from these three sites show how diasporic Chinese flexibly respond\nto political, economic, and cultural opportunities in these contexts, and thus are\nkey elements in the construction of a set of social and economic borders+ In this\nway it encourages one to see identity formation not just in terms of shared norms,\nbut also as the product of borders that are generated in relations of exclusion+\nThese new borders are not simply symbolic constructions; the fourth section shows\nhow Sino-Thai communities are supported by the informal organizations and net-\nworks of a diasporic public sphere+ The article thus highlights both the dynamic\ninteraction between Chinese, Thai, and Sino-Thai identity construction, and the\nmutual production of cosmopolitan and national politics+\nTheoretical Context\nBefore questioning the relation of nationalism and cosmopolitanism, it is impor-\ntant to clarify the meanings of diaspora, anthropological constructivism, and eco-\nnomic culture+ Diaspora has received much attention in recent years in the\nhumanities and anthropology as a way of understanding the complexities of glob-\nalization and transnationalism+6 Because diasporas\u2014almost by definition\u2014lack po-\nlitical status, they also present epistemological and ontological problems for IR\ntheory that is regulated by states and international regimes+7 Yet most diaspora\nresearch still begins and ends with a comparative examination of national identity+\nTo understand Sino-Thai identity, for example, the two national cultures are re-\nlated according to the distinction of assimilation0multiculturalism to ask whether\nthe \u201cChinese identity\u201d has been assimilated into Thai culture\u2014or not+ Diasporic\nChinese are studied as an \u201cethnic problem\u201d in the new states of postcolonial South-\neast Asia; similar to many Jewish communities in Europe, diasporic Chinese have\nbeen criticized as a pariah entrepreneur group that profited from European impe-\nrial regimes+ Politics is reduced to questions of the loyalty of these \u201cessential out-\nsiders\u201d to their Chinese homeland or their adopted nation+ Seen in this way,\n\u201cNationalism involves fixing fluid identities, refashioning their representations, and\nrigidifying the perception of boundaries between the self and the Other+\u201d 8 Sino-\n6+ See Clifford 1994;

Organization\nders in Mahasarakham+ Its community takes shape against the mobile and flexible\ncapitalism of the extra-provincial caravan traders+\nThe fieldwork recounted in this section certainly demonstrates the diversity of\nSino-Thai experience\u2014sometimes national, other times transnational, and still oth-\ners provincial\u2014and how it is formed in distinction to a set of Others: for example,\nanti-Indonesian in Bangkok, anti-Muslim in Phuket, and anti-caravan trader in Ma-\nhasarakham+ But one can generalize from this analysis+ In all three sites, Sino-\nThai are not at the periphery of either Thai or Chinese economic culture+ They are\nnot the sojourners of old who defined themselves in terms of China\u2019s standards of\ncivilization, or immigrants who have assimilated to Thai nationalism+ Rather, these\ngroups are busy networking for three particular forms of capitalism: international,\ntransnational, and provincial+ The key to understanding their activity is that they\nare all networking in similar ways: constructing diasporic identities against differ-\nence encountered in their specific contexts+ Hence, diasporic identity in Thailand\nfunctions in similar ways to national identity: it is not a culture of shared norms,\nso much as a set of common differences defined by particular economic-cultural\ncontexts+\nThe fieldwork helps one to question cosmopolitanism: none of these three dias-\nporas is evidence of an autonomous \u201cthird culture\u201d of Sino-Thai identity that \u201cseeks\nopportunities elsewhere+\u201d Rather than being flexible and mobile, as Nonini and\nOng argue, these three ethnographies show how the diaspora is flexible but not\nnecessarily mobile+ Thus research that points to the fluid cosmopolitanism of di-\naspora only applies to the limited case of wealthy \u201ctransnational yuppies+\u201d Rather\nthan being a transformative force for a new style of globalization, evidence shows\nthat diasporic Chinese adapt to particular economic contexts+ Rather than seeking\nopportunities elsewhere, they creatively respond to and develop opportunities in\ncontext+ They are very successful at colonizing and shaping particular economic\ncultures: international0national capitalism in Bangkok, transnational capitalism in\nPhuket, and provincial capitalism in Mahasarakham+ They are not nationalist in\nPhuket or Mahasarakham simply because most of the international0national eco-\nnomic opportunities are concentrated in the Bangkok area; they are less cosmo-\npolitan in Bangkok than expected for the same reason: it is the national economic\nnode+ Diasporas thus are not the pure agency of mobile capital, but flexibly re-\nspond to specific economic-cultural contexts\u2014in predictable ways, related to re-\nlations of difference+\nThough Khagram, Riker, and Sikkink lament that there are \u201cfew full-fledged\ntransnational movements,\u201d I think that the diasporic communities examined in this\narticle are worthy of their consideration+113 But rather than just looking to global\ncivil society to see how transnational nongovernmental organizations construct\n113+ Khagram, Riker, and

dias-\npora take shape in contextual relations between identity and difference as they\nproduce social, economic, and cultural borders+ Just as with the mutual construc-\ntion of diasporic and national identity in China and Thailand, the main point is not\nthe cultural content of the identity, but the relations of exclusion that produce it+\nHence to understand diasporic politics in Thailand, one needs to do more than\nchart out the specifics of each particular experience in Bangkok, Phuket, and Ma-\nhasarakham+ Rather than each being a prime example of nationalist, cosmopoli-\ntan, and local identity\u2014as expected\u2014the ethnographies show how economic and\nsocial activity is produced in a common logic of difference+ Though the content of\neach economic culture is different in the three sites, the form of identity formation\nvia exclusion is the same+ The evidence shows how identity is produced through\nconstructing borders of self and Other, not just for the most obvious case of na-\ntional identity, but in relations of exclusion in local and transnational contexts as\nwell+\nConclusion\nGlobalization does not simply describe a process whereby Western capitalism and\nAmerican popular culture dominate the world, and erode both state sovereignty\nand local culture+ This article has shown how Chinese capitalism and culture have\nbeen key in building borders and producing communities+ But rather than substi-\ntuting \u201cChinese\u201d for \u201cAmerican\u201d to describe this process, I have used diaspora to\nquestion popular understandings of the global versus the local to argue that cos-\nmopolitanism and nationalism produce each other in relations of norms and dif-\nference+ Hence, diasporas not only loosen any essential link between nation and\nstate but also illuminate the informal politics of the relation between the global\nand the local+\nThough diasporic Chinese capitalism is often figured as a peculiarly Asian\nform of globalization that erodes national borders in Southeast Asia, I have shown\nhow diasporic populations are intimately involved in defining borders+ The evi-\ndence has shown how neo-nationalism in China and Thailand shares a similar logic:\na highly territorialized identity, an economic-cultural understanding of neo-\nimperialism, and an Othering of the West+ Both have a strong notion of National\nHumiliation that relies on a foreign0domestic dynamic: foreign invasion aided by\ndomestic stupidity and corruption+ Both have used diasporic Chinese as a resource\nto construct a nationalist self and a foreign Other+ Though Thai nationalism has\nbeen constructed against a Chinese Other in the past, now neo-nationalism not\nonly includes Sino-Thai but is largely formulated by them+ Yet fieldwork shows\n510 International Organization\nhow many Sino-Thai in the provinces still figure Thai nationalism as an anti-\nChinese activity and are suspicious about its morality and practicality+\nThe analysis also questioned how nationalism and cosmopolitanism are formu-\nlated by arguing against the popular notion of diasporic Chinese as a cosmo-\npolitan community+ The ethnographies both added to and problematized critical\nconsiderations of diaspora by examining the diversity of \u2018Chineseness\u2019 as it is ar-\nticulated in different economic-cultural spaces in Thailand+ Fieldwork in Bang-\nkok, Phuket, and Mahasarakham demonstrated that ethnic Chinese populations do\nnot simply constitute a third culture+ Though internally coherent to people in Bang-\nkok, Phuket, and Mahasarakham, each ethnography called the others into ques-\ntion, adding to our critical view of national identity+ Diaspora thus both constructs\nand deconstructs the dynamic of nationalism and cosmopolitanism+ Rather than\nassimilating to Thai nationalism, diasporic Chinese are involved in colonizing the\nprevailing economic culture, be it national, transnational, or provincial+ It is note-\nworthy that on the one hand, many of the Bangkok elite who write neo-nationalist\nmanifestos are Sino-Thai, and on the other hand, a provincial diasporic Chinese\ninstitution is called the \u201cMahasarakham\u201d Association+ Examining the transna-\ntional politics of diaspora is thus helpful, as this group is often seen as \u201csocial\nproblem\u201d by states because it does not fit into normative notions of territory and\nidentity+ A sociological approach, for example, which examines national identity\nin terms of shared norms and institutions, would have missed this economic-\ncultural dynamic+\nThe analysis thus has theoretical import beyond the \u201cexotic East+\u201d As stated\nabove, one obvious conclusion to draw would be that the diversity of diasporic\neconomic cultures evades generalization as an example of either empiricism or\nrelativism+ Neither is the argument of this article+ Quite the opposite: generaliza-\ntions are possible, but one has to look in different places+ To understand how na-\ntionalism and cosmopolitanism, the global and the local work, one needs to see\nhow the outsiders, such as the diaspora, are necessary for constructing communi-\nties and producing boundaries+ Diasporas, thus are not just an economic resource,\nbut a symbolic resource in the economic cultures of cosmopolitanism, national-\nism, and localism+ To argue this, I have built on sociological constructivism\u2019s ex-\namination of identity and norms+ Certainly, there are considerable overlaps between\nsociological and anthropological constructivism; but the distinction is also impor-\ntant+ By focusing research on the search for cultural norms, sociological construc-\ntivism is unable to get beyond the assimilation0multiculturalism debate that limits\ndiaspora studies+ A sociological approach, for example, might look for common\nAsian norms to explain the similarities between Chinese and Thai neo-nationalism+\nBut rather than looking to culture as a substance that has content, I have shown\nhow anthropological constructivism highlights how culture takes shape in context-\nsensitive relations between identity and difference+ The article has shown that what\nChina and Thailand share is not a common identity, but a common set of\ndifferences\u2014in this case, diasporic Chinese and Western imperialism\u2014against\nwhich their particular national identities are constructed+\nChinese Diaspora in China and Thailand 511\nBy shifting the research agenda from norms to difference, we are better able to\nconsolidate sociological constructivism\u2019s anti-essentialist view of identity and un-\nderstand the complexities of transnational politics+A future research agenda would\ntrace how this logic of identity and exclusion applies beyond the cases of China\nand Thailand to the relations of difference between other nations and other dias-\nporas+ As mentioned in the introduction, the Islamic diaspora in Europe is inti-\nmately involved in producing recent neo-nationalisms in France, England, Germany,\nand the Netherlands+ Jewish, Irish, and South Asian diasporas are likewise impor-\ntant elements in various nationalisms around the world+ In this way, diaspora re-\nsearch is part of the movement in IR from a tight focus on \u201cinter-national,\u201d to an\nattention to \u201crelations\u201d\u2014the relational nature of identity+\nTo address these issues, IR theory needs to better explore the questions of eco-\nnomic culture thus far raised mostly by historians and anthropologists+ IR scholars\ncould add expertise in norms, states, and regimes to this crossover discipline that\ncombines cultural analysis and IPE to examine the politics of transnational flows\nof people, cultural practices, and capital+ IR theory would also have to take more\nseriously the politics of Otherness+ It is not a coincidence that the most\ncompelling transnational social movements, especially since Seattle 1999, do not\ndescribe themselves normatively according to what they are for, but counter-\nnormatively according to what they oppose: anti-globalization, anti-capitalism, anti-\nAmerican in Europe, and anti-West in the rest of the world+ The modalities of\nthese transnational social movements also appeal to Otherness and counter-\nnormative opposition: nongovernmental organization and nonviolent action+114 To\nunderstand such transnational politics, it is necessary to more closely examine the\npolitics of difference to see how it shapes these important nonstate movements+\nThis article has used the peculiar example of the Chinese diaspora to start an\nexamination of these larger political issues+ As the empirical evidence demon-\nstrated, diaspora are not simply an \u201cethnic problem+\u201d They are key in the construc-\ntion and deconstruction of the seemingly opposite ideologies of nationalism and\ncosmopolitanism+ Diaspora thus not only adds new data to arguments about global0\nlocal relations+ It helps one question the structures of world politics that look to\nthe opposition between cosmopolitanism and nationalism+\nReferences\nAmarin Khoman+ 2000+ Thai mee ekkarat pro rao mee chatniyom @Thailand Has Independence Be-\ncause We Have Nationalism#+ Setthasart kanmuang
