INTRODUCTION\nIn the last decade violet InGaN laser diodes (LD\u2019s) have\nbeen the subject of considerable attention, with the studies\nmainly motivated by the prospect of the application of the\ndevices to high-density optical disk storage and optical data\nprocessing [1]. In particular, blue-violet laser diodes are re-\nquired for CD or DVD systems to increase the disk storage\ncapacity up to 25 Gbytes. As a result of recent research,\n400 nm (blue-violet) LD performance has been improved\nand the lifetime has been extended to over 15 000 hours [2].\nBlue-violet CW LD\u2019s are already commercially available and\nseveral reports have recently appeared concerning the CW\noperation of blue lasers at room temperature [3\u20137]. In this\npaper we consider the phenomena of excitability and self\npulsation (SP) in blue-violet InGaN lasers.\nThe use of self-pulsation is attractive for the reduction of\nfeedback noise [8,9] in CD and DVD systems but since the\nearly investigation of Nakamura et al. [10], self-pulsating\nviolet and blue-violet LD\u2019s have not been studied in any\ndetail. Although less well known than self-pulsation, excit-\nability is a new and rapidly expanding topic in optics, having\ninitially received much more attention in biology [11] and\nchemistry [12]. However, in recent years there has been\ngrowing interest in excitability in the physics and engineer-\ning communities, and recognition that the phenomenon\nmight have device applications in optics. Recently, there\nhave been theoretical predictions of excitability in devices,\nsuch as optical cavities and different types of lasers [13\u201317],\nand in some cases these predictions have been supported by\nexperimental observation. For example, there is particularly\nconvincing experimental evidence of excitability in a laser\nwith a short external cavity [18]. In addition, an experimental\ninvestigation of the excitable properties of a solid-state laser\nwith an intracavity saturable absorber is reported by Laro-\ntonda et al. [19].\nIn this paper, we report studies of the dynamics of a mul-\ntiquantum well InGaN laser with a saturable absorber (SA).\nIn particular, we investigate the self-pulsation and excitable\noperation of the laser, with particular emphasis on the latter.\nWe start in Sec. II with a description of the laser structure\nand the theoretical model and the associated equations used\nto calculate the device behavior. The results of numerical\ncalculations of the device dynamics are presented and dis-\ncussed in Sec. III and the conclusions are given in Sec. IV.\nII. LASER STRUCTURE, MODEL, AND EQUATIONS\nFigure 1 shows the structure of the InGaN laser with satu-\nrable absorber that has been considered; it consists of a mul-\ntiquantum well (MQW) InGaN active layer and a saturable\nabsorber in the form of a single p-type InGaN quantum well.\nRelatively thin saturable absorber layers varying from\n1 to 3 nm have been used with a view to maintaining a low\nthreshold current. The AlGaN layer prevents significant car-\nrier overflow from the active region. In the fabrication pro-\ncess, the saturable absorber layer was grown as a layer par-\nallel to the active region, which is different from the situation\ntreated in previous papers where the SA\u2019s were grown per-\npendicular to the active region [20\u201323]. Further details on\nthe fabrication method are given by Ohno et al. [24]. The\nlasing wavelength is at 395 nm and three different cavity\n*Email address: tronciu@ec.t.kanazawa-u.ac.jp\nFIG. 1.

Iij gives the carrier injection from the j to i region. The\nsecond term in the photon rate equation describes the spon-\ntaneous emission and M is the equivalent total number of the\nlongitudinal modes, which is evaluated from the half width\nof the linear gain spectrum. Vi is the volume expressed by\nVi=WidiL, where L is the laser length and di and Wi are the\nthickness and width, respectively, of the relevant region. The\nterm involving B describes the self-saturation of the gain and\nimplies a nonlinearity of the system.

In the numerical calculations,\nwe take into account four dynamical regions: the central ac-\ntive region 1 and saturable absorber 2 as well as the outer\nregions 3 and 4. The other regions have been taken into\naccount for the calculation of the effective refractive index,\nnear field patterns and confinement factors. Region 5 is a cap\nlayer, which is electrically connected to the external current\nsource. The field distribution in the transverse cross section\nis analyzed by the effective refractive index method [25],\nwhere the spatial variation of the refractive indices and the\ngain-loss properties of the media are taken into account.\nEach region of the device shown in Fig. 1 is taken to have a\nrefractive index which is dependent on its alloy composition\nand the wavelength of the radiation. The field confinement\nfactors ji of the regions 1\u20134 are not constant and have been\nevaluated during the pulsations [20]. The equivalent volumes\nof the outer regions 3 and 4 also vary and were evaluated\nwith the electron distribution width in these regions [20].\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFigure 2 shows the theoretical (solid line) and experimen-\ntal (squares) results obtained for the dependence of the\nthreshold current on cavity length for the laser of Fig. 1. The\nvalues of the parameters used in the simulations are listed in\nTable I. The experiments were carried out at room tempera-\nture and the characteristics were measured using a pulsed\ncurrent, in an effort to avoid heating. Theory predicts that the\nthreshold current should increase from 80 to 125 mA as the\ncavity length increased from 350 to 650 mm. The theoretical\nresults are broadly supported by experiment; although there\nis a discrepancy in the predicted and measured threshold cur-\nrents for the 650 mm cavity, we believe that is due to signifi-\ncant heating of the device that occurred despite the precau-\ntions taken. Note that the inclusion of a SA acts to increase\nthe threshold current of the laser. For example, a laser of\nsimilar design and a cavity length of 500 mm, but without a\nSA, recently exhibited a measured threshold current of\n29 mA [26], compared to the value of 100 mA found for a\ndevice of the same length with a SA.\nTo understand the properties of the laser, we have consid-\nered the laser dynamics in terms of bifurcation diagrams.\nFigure 3 is an example of such a diagram and shows the\ncalculated peak photon number versus injected current for a\nlaser with a cavity length of 500 mm. As the injected current\nis increased above threshold CW operation is observed and\nthe corresponding photon number is given by thin solid line\nnear the left side of Fig. 3. At a certain current, denoted by\nthe left hand solid circle in the figure, there is a Hopf bifur-\ncation and the laser begins to pulsate. The thick line to the\nright of the solid circle gives the peak photon number in the\npulsations. As the injected current is increased further the\npulsation amplitude goes through a maximum before vanish-\ning at the upper Hopf point denoted by the right hand solid\ncircle. Both Hopf points are supercritical and the character-\nistic is essentially different from the other self-pulsating la-\nsers reported in Refs. [20,22,23], where SP starts right at the\nFIG. 2. Dependence of the threshold current on the cavity\nlength. The SA has a thickness of 3 nm and a carrier lifetime of\n0.1 ns. The other parameters are given in Table I.\nTRONCIU, YAMADA, AND ABRAM PHYSICAL REVIEW E 70, 026604 (2004)\n026604-2\nthreshold current. This difference in behavior may be a result\nof the different carrier lifetimes in the active region and in\nthe SA. In some of our devices, the SA layer has an interface\nwith the AlGaN evaporation prevention layer [24] and this\nmay reduce the carrier lifetime in the SA due to interface-\ninduced nonradiative recombination. Also we found that\nsuch a bifurcation diagram with generation of SP through a\nHopf bifurcation is appropriate for lasers with a short cavity\nlength.\nNow we consider the influence of the carrier lifetime on\nthe laser dynamics for two different values of SA thickness 2\nand 3 nm. The carrier lifetime in an InGaN multiquantum\nwell laser diode has been estimated to between 1.8 and 3 ns\n[1,2] and we have used the value 2 ns in the active region for\nour calculations. However, for a saturable absorber, recent\nstudies [27] have shown a carrier lifetime in the range\n2 ps to 2.5 ns which is dependent on well thickness and\nbias current. A room-temperature study of the dependence of\ncarrier lifetime on the width of an InGaN single quantum\nwell is reported in Ref. [28], where the carrier recombination\nwas found to be dominated by nonradiative processes.\nWithin the quantum well thickness range from 1 to 6 nm,\nthe carrier lifetime was found to increase from\n180 to 340 ps. It has been suggested previously [24] that\nself-pulsating operation would occur in an InGaN laser with\na very short carrier lifetime in the SA. In that work, two\nlasers were fabricated with the same structure except that one\nhad an additional 20 nm p-type GaN layer between the Al-\nGaN evaporation prevention layer and the SA layer. The re-\nsults showed that the SP was observed only in the laser with-\nout the additional GaN layer, where the carrier lifetime in the\nSA is small. Figure 4 shows the numerically obtained Hopf\nbifurcation lines for two different values of the thickness of\nthe SA 2 nm (solid line) and 3 nm (dashed line). It is appar-\nent for a SA of 2 nm thickness that the region of SP can\noccur for a wide range of carrier lifetime in the active region\nbut for a much narrower range of lifetime in the SA. Also the\nrequired carrier lifetime in the SA is much smaller than in the\nactive region. In the case of a 3 nm thick SA, the region of\nSP is much larger, and also SP can be achieved for a rather\nhigher value of carrier lifetime in the SA but one that is still\nless than for the active region lifetime. These results reiterate\nthe point that a large carrier lifetime in the active region\nrequires a relatively small lifetime in the SA for SP to occur.\nHowever, from these results we can conclude that Hopf lines\nonly appear in the case of lasers with a short cavity length\nand a low absorption level. We now consider the parameters\nappropriate to that for excitability detection.\nTABLE I.

General bifurcation analysis related to excitability\nin different types of laser is reported in Ref. [29] but here we\ndiscuss specifically the mechanism of excitability for a blue\nInGaN laser of practical design and consider two possibili-\nties to achieve excitable behavior in such lasers.\nWe begin by considering what is predicted to happen if\nthe carrier lifetime in the SA is increased from 0.1 to 2 ns\n(the value in the active region) for a laser with a cavity\nlength of 650 mm and a SA thickness of 2 nm. The results of\nthe numerical calculations of photon number against injected\ncurrent are shown in Fig. 5. For a SA carrier lifetime of\n0.1 ns the laser exhibits, as mentioned earlier, self-pulsations\nas a result of the Hopf bifurcations marked by the squares in\nFig. 5(a). With increasing SA carrier lifetime, the pulsation\nregion decreases as shown in Fig. 5(b). The carrier lifetime\nof 1.4 ns, to which Fig. 5(c) refers, is considered the critical\nvalue, after which the hysteresis phenomenon implicit in Fig.\n5(d) (corresponding to a lifetime of 2 ns) appears. A further\nincrease of SA carrier lifetime is accompanied by a decrease\nof the size of the pulsation region and more pronounced\nhysteresis. A linear stability analysis shows that the lower\nbranch of the hysteresis curve is stable while the upper one is\nunstable. For the same current, a stable node, a saddle, and\nan unstable focus are present, providing conditions that can\nresult in excitable behavior. In fact, we have found that when\nthe operating point is situated in the current range denoted by\n(e) in Fig. 5(d), the laser is excitable. We have also found\nthat the phenomenon of excitability becomes more pro-\nnounced as the cavity length is increased. We note that ex-\ncitability has been predicted to occur when the carrier life-\ntimes in the active and SA regions are the same, in contrast\nto the conditions for self-pulsation, where a significantly\nshorter lifetime in the SA is required. This means that excit-\nability could be achieved in practice in a device where the\nsaturable absorber is made of the same material as the active\nregion and is located next to it in the longitudinal direction.\nAn alternative approach to obtaining excitability is to\nhave a suitable value for the absorption level. Figure 6 shows\na bifurcation diagram in the plane of SA differential gain\ncoefficient versus injected current for a laser with a cavity\nlength of 650 mm and carrier lifetimes of 2 and 0.5 ns in the\nactive and SA regions, respectively. For aSA,12\n310\u221212 m3 s\u22121 the laser shows either CW or nonlasing op-\neration for any value of injected current. However, an in-\nFIG. 4.

The laser behaviour in the different regions is\ndenoted by excitable (EX), self-pulsating (SP), and CW or nonlas-\ning. The solid line represents a Hopf-bifurcation line.\nTRONCIU, YAMADA, AND ABRAM PHYSICAL REVIEW E 70, 026604 (2004)\n026604-4\ncrease of the differential gain coefficient of the SA causes the\nsystem to cross the Hopf bifurcation indicated by the solid\nthick line in Fig. 6. Further increase of the differential gain\ncoefficient of the SA results in a homoclinic bifurcation,\nwhich is denoted by the filled circle in Fig. 6. Between the\ndotted and dashed lines, excitability is found to occur. The\nimplication of the figure is that, to achieve excitability in\npractice by this approach, we need a sufficiently high value\nof SA differential gain coefficient. However, increasing the\nSA differential gain coefficient increases both the absorption\nlevel and the injected current.\nAs was mentioned above the existence of excitability is\ndetermined by the carrier lifetimes, the absorption level in\nthe saturable absorber and the cavity length. Let us now con-\nsider the case of a more pronounced excitability. Figure 7(a)\nshows the different types of system behavior found in the\nphoton number\u2014injected current plane for large values of\ncarrier lifetime in both the active and the SA regions s2 nsd\nand high absorption level sa=23310\u221211 m3 s\u22121d with a\n650 mm cavity length. When the injected current is smaller\nthan 114 mA, the laser shows only CW operation, corre-\nsponding to the existence of a stable stationary state (stable\nfocus). For injected currents between 114 and 124 mA, a\nlinear stability analysis shows the existence of a saddle close\nto a stable node, which is well known to provide a mecha-\nnism for excitability. A confirmation that excitability is actu-\nally predicted in this case is given below. When the injected\ncurrent is in the range 124\u2013128 mA the laser shows self-\npulsation operation, corresponding to the presence of a limit\ncycle. A further increase of injected current results in CW\noperation. As a result we are led to conclude that a large\ncarrier lifetime in the SA, a high absorption level and a large\ncavity length are required to achieve pronounced excitability.\nFigure 7(b) shows the response of the laser to a sequence\nof injected current pulses with different amplitudes and delay\ntimes when it is a state within the excitability region [circle\nin Fig. 7(a)]. There is a substantial response when an input\npulse exceeds a certain threshold (such as for the first pertur-\nbation pulse) while the response to pulses below the thresh-\nold (such as the third pulse) is much smaller. Comparison of\nthe effect of the first and fourth pulses shows that the re-\nsponse is essentially independent of the perturbation ampli-\ntude as long as it is above threshold. Further, there is evi-\ndence of a refractory period, since when the two pulses are\nseparated by a sufficiently short time interval (such as the\nfifth and sixth pulses), the later pulse has an insignificant\neffect on the system. On the other hand, there is clear evi-\ndence of a significant response to both pulses when they are\nseparated by a sufficiently large time interval (compare first\nand second pulses). Taken together the above properties are a\nclear indication of the presence of excitability in the system.\nSpecifically, we have been able to confirm the three charac-\nteristics of excitability: the existence of a threshold above\nwhich an excitation can occur; a response independent of the\nmagnitude of a perturbation above threshold; and the exis-\ntence of a refractory period. Finally, we need to mention that\nstill getting experimental excitable behavior of InGaN lasers\nis accompanied by difficulties. However, we expect that the\nphenomena of excitability could be observed in the lasers\nwith cavity length larger than 650 mm and thick AlGaN\nlayer, which results in the larger carrier lifetime in the SA.\nWe believe that our work provides a good basis for future\nstudy and, in particular provides some pointers for more de-\ntailed investigations of excitability and coherence resonance\nin InGaN lasers and their possible practical applications.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have carried out an investigation of the dynamics of\nblue-violet InGaN lasers with a saturable absorber. A bifur-\ncation analysis shows that a Hopf bifurcation is responsible\nfor the appearance of self-pulsation under suitable condi-\ntions. Also two different possibilities to obtain excitable be-\nhavior of the devices have been discussed. It has been shown\nFIG. 7.

Large cavity length and high saturable\nabsorber differential gain coefficient are also favorable for\npronounced excitability. The studies of the dynamics of In-\nGaN lasers are still at an early stage and further theoretical\nand experiment work is necessary for a proper understanding\nof the mechanisms involved and a full exploration of the\npotential application of the phenomena [30].\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank Tomoki Ohno, Shigetoshi\nIto, Toshiyuki Kawakami, and Mototaka Taneya from the\nDevices Technology Research Laboratories, Sharp Corpora-\ntion, Japan for the experimental support and detailed discus-\nsions.
