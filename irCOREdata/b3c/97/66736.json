INTRODUCTION\nAUTONOMOUS renewable energy systems such aswind, solar, and micro-hydro require control methods to\nmaintain stability, due to the real time variation of input energy\nand load, while maximizing the use of the renewable resource.\nUnlike conventional engine driven autonomous power systems\nwhich use governors for frequency control, small autonomous\nrenewable energy systems may be controlled using either load\ncontrol or energy storage.\nStorage devices such as batteries, flywheels, and hydraulic\naccumulators [1] have all been considered for frequency control\nbut are often rather expensive and complex to control. Simple\nload control has been used in autonomous systems on Fair-Isle\n[2] and Lundy Island [3] in the UK and in a number of laboratory\nexperiments, e.g., [4].\nThis paper describes an advanced distributed load control\nsystem using a low cost, microcontroller based, frequency and\nvoltage-sensing device. Each load control device is based on a\nPIC16C711 microcontroller with no direct communication be-\ntween them. Individual single-phase loads are connected to the\nsupply through these devices. Distributed load control systems\ncan be more robust than centralized systems because if one load\ncontroller fails the system can continue to function.\nManuscript received October 25, 1999.\nK.

Sections IV and\nV present the development of a fuzzy control algorithm for\nthe load switching decision and the results of site tests on an\nautonomous micro-hydro and a wind only system.\nII. DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF FREQUENCY AND\nVOLTAGE MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES\nA. Frequency and Voltage Measurement Algorithms\nFig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the frequency and\nvoltage-sensing device.\nA number of frequency measurement algorithms [5] were in-\nvestigated including zero crossing detection, level crossing de-\ntection, superposition and Fast Fourier Transform based fre-\nquency measurement. The level crossing detection algorithm\nwas preferred as it allowed multiple frequency estimates per\ncycle and multiple use of voltage samples.\n1) Level Crossing Detection (LCD) Algorithm: The LCD al-\ngorithm [6] estimates the frequency deviation of the signal from\nthe nominal frequency. The input voltage signal is sampled at\na constant rate, samples per cycle, at a sampling time of\nms, such that is close to the time period of the nominal fre-\nquency. The samples in the previous cycle are projected to the\nnext cycle of the voltage signal. This projected distance equals\nthe time period of the signal, which is unknown. Since is\nfixed, calculating the deviation from enables the time pe-\nriod of the signal to be calculated as shown in (1)\n(1)\n0885\u20138969\/01$10.00 \u00a9 2001 IEEE\nPANDIARAJ et al.: DISTRIBUTED LOAD CONTROL OF AUTONOMOUS RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS 15\nThe deviation at any time , , is calculated from four\nvoltage samples by applying linear interpolation as shown in (2)\n(2)\nwhere and are the present and previous samples in\nthe current cycle. and are the samples\nin the previous cycle separated by a distance of and\nfrom the present sample.\nThus, an estimation of the time period and hence the\nfrequency is possible at each sampling instant. However, a\nweighted mean of several ( ) estimates of , as shown in\n(3), is used to obtain the frequency estimate.\n(3)\nwhere is at sample and is the weighting factor\nat sample . The weighting factor calculation can be found\nin [6].\n2) RMS Voltage Measurement: Fixed and moving window\nconfigurations were investigated for the rms voltage measure-\nment. In a fixed window configuration of samples width, the\nvoltage estimates were obtained every samples as shown by\n(4).\n(4)\nwhere, are the instantaneous voltage samples.\nIn the moving window configuration, the voltage estimates\nwere obtained at every sampling instant as shown by (5).\n(5)\nA switching-decision count, , of consecutive estimates\nwhich must exceed the threshold setting before a switching\ndecision is taken was used to ensure correct operation of the\nload controllers. This was applied to both the frequency and\nfixed window voltage measurements.\nB. PSCAD\/EMTDC Simulation of Measurement Techniques\nA model was developed, to calculate frequency and voltage\nusing the level crossing detection and rms voltage measure-\nment algorithms, in the electromagnetic transient program,\nPSCAD\/EMTDC [7].\nThe model used , , and ms,\nand provided frequency estimates every 12 samples. An error of\nFig. 2. ICE test result\u2014Error variation of the LCD algorithm.\n0.19 Hz was noted at 51 Hz in a test frequency range between\n44 Hz and 51 Hz. It was found that the LCD algorithm required\n50 ms to detect a frequency variation.\nThe error in the rms voltage estimates, for a 230 V signal,\nwas 1.05 V for a fixed window configuration of 13 samples\nwidth. For a voltage variation, the minimum response time was\nfound to be 47 ms. For the moving window configuration of\nsame window width, the error was only 0.8 V and the response\ntime was 40 ms.\nThese simulation results showed that the LCD algorithm and\nthe moving window configuration algorithm were able to give\nfast and accurate frequency and voltage estimates, respectively.\nC. Laboratory Testing of the Measurement Techniques\nAssembly language code [5] for the measurement techniques\nwas developed. The parameters used in the code were the same\nas that of the EMTDC simulation. The code was programmed\ninto the microcontroller and tested in real time using an\nIn-Circuit Emulator (ICE), and a relay test set.\n1) ICE Test:\na) Performance of the Frequency Measurement Algo-\nrithm: The detailed description of the test set up and the\nprocedure can be found in [5]. Fig. 2 shows the variation of the\nerror in the estimate of different input frequencies.\nIt can be seen that the error is less than 0.1 Hz for frequen-\ncies between 48 Hz and 50 Hz. The error has increased for other\nfrequencies due to the limited resolution (8-bit) of the A\/D con-\nverter. Therefore, to obtain accurate estimates for frequencies\nbetween 44 Hz and 46 Hz, 46 Hz and 48 Hz the sampling times\nwere changed to 2.502 ms and 2.383 ms respectively. These\nsampling times were obtained from the PSCAD\/EMTDC sim-\nulation by trial and error. Tests were carried out on the ICE for\nthese frequency ranges using the modified sampling times and\nan error variation of 0\u20130.1 Hz was confirmed.\nb) Performance of the Voltage Measurement Algo-\nrithm: Only the fixed window configuration was tested using\nthe ICE. For a voltage signal of magnitude 230 V, an error of\n3 V was found in the voltage estimates.\n2) Use of Relay Test Set:\nc) Testing of Frequency Measurement Algorithm: Fig. 3\nshows the frequency variation obtained from a PC based relay\ntest set (OMICRON) [8], and the microcontroller output. The\nresponse time ( ) was measured to be 62.5 ms. This compared\nwith the minimum response time of 50 ms obtained with the\nPSCAD\/EMTDC simulation.\n16 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION, VOL. 16, NO. 1, MARCH 2001\nFig. 3. Relay test set result\u2014frequency measurement algorithm.\nFig. 4. Relay test set result\u2014moving window voltage measurement algorithm.\nd) Testing of Voltage Measurement Algorithms: Fig. 4\nshows the voltage variation obtained from the relay test set,\nand the microcontroller output for the moving window voltage\nmeasurement algorithm.\nFrom Fig. 4, the response time ( ) was measured to be\n45 ms compared to the 40 ms response time obtained from\nPSCAD\/EMTDC simulation. This result shows good agree-\nment between the simulation and laboratory tests. The slight\ndifference in response times was due to the use of a simple first\norder infinite impulse response (IIR) type digital filter with a\ntime constant of 4.6 ms in this test.\nFor a fixed window configuration, the response time was\nmeasured to be 62 ms. This result was also found to be in good\ncomparison with the PSCAD\/EMTDC simulation. Overall,\nthe laboratory tests validated the PSCAD\/EMTDC simulation\nresults.\nIII. SITE TEST OF MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES\nThe test site was a micro-hydro power system, rated at 18 kW,\nsingle phase, 230 V, at Polmood in the UK. This system was\nchosen because it permitted flexible operation, including varia-\ntion of the frequency and voltage. In addition, an existing elec-\ntronic dump load controller heavily distorted the voltage wave-\nform (Fig. 5).\nA. Steady State Accuracy Test\n1) Frequency Measurement Technique: For the site test, mi-\ncrocontrollers were programmed with various values of and\n. The use of larger values of and for the site tests in-\ncreased the steady state accuracy but reduced the speed of re-\nsponse. A maximum measured error of 0.04 Hz was found even\nin the presence of the heavily distorted waveform.\nFig. 5. Voltage waveform distortion by existing dump load controller.\n2) Voltage Measurement Techniques: The moving and fixed\nwindow configurations were tested simultaneously. The moving\nwindow configuration used the digital filter with a time con-\nstant of 11.5 ms and the fixed window configuration used a\nswitching-decision count ( ) of 3. An error of 4 V was found\nfor the moving window configuration and of 2 V for the fixed\nwindow configuration. The increase in error for the moving\nwindow configuration was due to the heavily distorted voltage\nwaveform.\nB. Transient Response Tests\n1) Frequency Measurement Technique: The frequency mea-\nsurement algorithm was tested for various threshold settings\nwith a range of values of and from 10\u201315 and 3\u20135 respec-\ntively. An average response time of 175 ms was obtained from\nthese tests with a fastest measured response time of 87 ms.\n2) Voltage Measurement Techniques: Average response\ntimes of 58 ms and 88 ms were found for the moving and fixed\nwindow configurations respectively.\nIn summary, the site test confirmed that the LCD algorithm\ncould be used for frequency measurement with an accuracy of\n0.04 Hz and a response time of 175 ms even for the distorted\nwaveform. For rms voltage measurement, the moving window\nconfiguration is preferred as it gave a faster response with a\nsmaller error than the fixed window configuration. Optimization\nof the trade-off between accuracy and speed of response is the\nsubject of continuing research.\nIV. DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF FUZZY CONTROL SYSTEM\nA. Fuzzy Load Control Algorithm\nThe previous generation of load controllers [1]\u2013[4] use a\nthreshold system based on the generator droop characteristic to\nmake the switching decisions. This system has two main disad-\nvantages. Firstly some loads experience a much better service\nthan others. Secondly the load controllers have to be configured\nfor each system using a difficult process which involves finding\nsuitable sizes of loads and setting the thresholds at the correct\npoints on the droop characteristic.\nTo overcome these problems a fuzzy control system was de-\nveloped to provide an improved frequency control solution. All\nthe fuzzy controllers share a single target frequency and there-\nfore do not require a complex set up procedure.\nFuzzy logic is particularly appropriate for systems where the\nsources of information are interpreted qualitatively, inexactly or\nPANDIARAJ et al.: DISTRIBUTED LOAD CONTROL OF AUTONOMOUS RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS 17\nFig. 6. Fuzzy control diagram.\nTABLE I\nFUZZY CONTROLLER DESIGN\nuncertainly [9]. The control problem in question exhibits each\nof these features. For example, interpretation of system status\nis qualitative, any measurement algorithms are inexact and the\ngeneration and load profiles are uncertain.\nThe load controllers are required to operate on many\nautonomous systems with different power ratings, inertia\nconstants, renewable energy sources and load profiles. Fuzzy\ncontrol is robust and non linear and therefore is able to function\nwell across this wide operating range.\nFuzzy controllers use verbal rules rather than mathematical\nrelationships. This process is not computationally intensive [10]\nwhich results in fast execution times. This feature means they\nare attractive for real time control problems. Fig. 6. illustrates\nthe control system being described.\nThe fuzzy control system was developed using the PIC\nfuzzyTECH software development system [11]. This\npackage allows fuzzy code to be embedded directly into\nthe microcontrollers.\nThe application is a multiple input single output, MISO\nsystem and uses state evaluation control rules. The process\nstate is evaluated and a fuzzy control action is computed at time\nas a function of the inputs and the control rules. The rules are\nof the form IF (process state1) AND (process state2) THEN\n(control output)\nMeasurement algorithms provide inputs of frequency and rate\nof change of frequency to the fuzzy controller. When designing\na fuzzy controller there are many design choices, Table I. lists\nthe fundamental fuzzy controller design choices made in this\ncase.\nThe design choices made on the whole were conventional and\ncan be found in [10], apart from the method of de-fuzzification\nwhich is less well known. The center of maximum method,\nCOM, was chosen as it is an approximation of the more common\nand computationally intensive center of gravity method. The\nCOM de-fuzzification method computed a crisp output and gave\nthe best compromise between the inputs received.\nVarious rule bases and membership functions were tested\nusing simulation software before selection of the final system\nFig. 7. MATLAB\/SIMULINK simulation frequency control results.\nwas made. The rule base was designed using knowledge of\npower system dynamics and contained 9 rules. A trade off\nbetween system complexity and a simple low memory solution\nwas required so that the final controller software could be\nstored in the limited program memory of the microcontroller.\nThe fuzzy controller produced a crisp value which advised\none of the following output actions, Load on, Load off, or No\naction. The fuzzy controller also indicated the degree of truth\nin the control action advised. There is no overall supervisory\ncontroller for the load controllers and they did not communi-\ncate with each other. Therefore in order to ensure that the load\ncontrollers operate individually and that the energy is shared eq-\nuitably among the loads, C code was developed to provide a\nrandom element to the load controllers. The code also ensured\nthat the overall load connected was proportional to the degree\nof truth indicated by the fuzzy controller.\nB. MATLAB\/SIMULINK Simulation of Fuzzy Controllers\nA computer model of a wind only system controlled\nby the fuzzy load controllers was developed using\nMATLAB\/SIMULINK and was used to test the fuzzy\ncontrollers. The model included aerodynamic and electrical\nrepresentations. The model used real wind speed data as an\ninput and included over 100 load controllers switching varying\nsizes of load. The model allowed the fuzzy algorithm and the\nrandom load distribution software to be refined. It can be seen\nin Fig. 7. that the frequency was well controlled with maximum\nand minimum values of 50.7 and 49.2 Hz., respectively.\nC. Laboratory Testing\nThe load controller hardware was modified to include a\nTRIAC rather than an electromagnetic relay. TRIACs have a\nlonger lifetime than the electromagnetic relays and can switch\nat the higher frequencies required for effective power system\ncontrol. The power rating was also increased so that the load\ncontrollers could switch loads of up to 7 kW.\nA set of fifteen modified load controllers was built and incor-\nporated into a single test unit. Before site testing the load con-\ntroller hardware and software was thoroughly tested on a labo-\nratory test rig comprising a 3 kW synchronous generator driven\nby a variable speed drive. The power generated was switched\n18 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION, VOL. 16, NO. 1, MARCH 2001\nFig. 8. Fuzzy control site test, micro-hydro turbine results.\nthrough a bank of resistors using the fuzzy load controllers to\ngovern the system frequency.\nV. SITE TESTS\nA. Micro-Hydro Site Test\nThe fuzzy load controllers were tested on the micro-hydro site\ndescribed in Section III. The system was configured to generate\naround 14 kW. Fifteen, 1 kW loads were connected to the fuzzy\nload controllers and switched to maintain a stable frequency. It\ncan be seen from Fig. 8 that the results were encouraging with\nfrequency control of 0.2 Hz achieved. The existing dump load\ncontroller was controlling the system at 52 Hz during the initial\nperiod after that the system was under the sole influence of the\nfuzzy load controllers.\nB. Wind Only Site Test\nSite tests were performed on an autonomous wind only\nsystem with a nominal 60 kW, stall regulated, horizontal axis\nturbine, fitted with a 100 kVA synchronous generator. The load\ncontrollers were connected to 15 individual 6 kW loads. This\nallowed the turbine to be controlled solely by the fuzzy load\ncontrollers even at the peak power of 90 kW. Data-logging\nequipment was connected to record the system status whilst\nunder fuzzy load control.\nC. Test Results\nThe wind speed during the testing was low and varied from\n3 m\/s to 8 m\/s. The turbine begins to generate appreciable power\nat around 6 m\/s and reaches rated power at 13 m\/s. Therefore\nduring testing the wind power occasionally dropped to zero.\nThe load controllers responded to the varying input power by\nswitching the loads in an attempt to control the system fre-\nquency. Fig. 9. shows the system frequency when under the con-\ntrol of the fuzzy load controllers.\nFig. 9. shows that the frequency control, during a seven\nminute period, on the whole was between 51 and 48 Hz. with\noccasional dips due to lulls in wind speed. During these dips\nall the load controllers shed their loads and so these dips were\nunavoidable on a wind only system.\nThe results show that on the whole the system frequency\nis controlled to within the limits detailed in the EN50160\nEuropean standard document regarding voltage characteristics\nFig. 9. Fuzzy control site test, wind turbine results.\nFig. 10. Site test, voltage waveform with fuzzy zero crossing switching.\nof autonomous systems [12]. The site results did not achieve\nthe same level of frequency control as that produced by the\nMATLAB\/SIMULINK model. This is because only 15 loads\nwere used as opposed to 100 and the loads were relatively large.\nThis causes the control to be coarse as the minimum control\naction is 6 kW. The frequency control was not as successful as\nfor the micro-hydro system, as the input wind power is subject\nto greater fluctuations.\nZero crossing optical drivers were used to control the TRIACs\nto ensure that switching actions were taken at voltage zero cross-\nings. This compromises the speed of response of the control\nsystem but minimizes the distortion of the voltage waveform.\nIt can be seen in Fig. 10. that the distortion of the waveform is\nnegligible in comparison to that caused by the dump load con-\ntroller present at the micro-hydro site (Fig. 5).\nVI. CONCLUSION\nA new frequency and voltage-sensing device was applied\nfor distributed load control of autonomous renewable energy\nsystems. The performance of the measurement techniques\nwas tested in the laboratory and on site. The tests showed\nthat the measurement algorithms are able to provide accurate\nand fast frequency and voltage estimates even with a distorted\nwaveform.\nFuzzy controllers were developed to control the system\nfrequency adequately without any appreciable distortion of the\nvoltage waveform. The fuzzy controllers offer a robust, low\ncost control solution applicable to a wide range of autonomous\nsystems with a reduced need for customization.\nPANDIARAJ et al.: DISTRIBUTED LOAD CONTROL OF AUTONOMOUS RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS 19\nTests on other power systems are planned for the near future\nin particular a site with a wind turbine driven induction gener-\nator and synchronous compensator.\nAn element of on-line self-tuning of the fuzzy algorithms is\nalso being considered.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would primarily like to thank the industrial\ncollaborators Econnect Ltd.
