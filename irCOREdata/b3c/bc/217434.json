On \nthis bald fact most contemporary observers and historians seem to be able to agree.  \nThere is, furthermore, a degree of consensus \u2013 again between both those who lived \nthrough the era and those who have studied it more recently - that this malaise reflected \nthe profound differences between the situation in the late 1940s when the Atlantic \nrelationship had first been institutionalised and the conditions which prevailed two \ndecades later.  An alliance, partnership or even \u2018empire\u2019 born at a time of US nuclear \nmonopoly, near total American economic dominance, deep and generalised Western \nanxiety vis-\u00e0-vis Stalinist Russia, and a widespread  agreement amongst foreign policy-\nmaking elites on both sides of the Atlantic that the fate of Europe was central to the \nunfolding cold war, struggled to adapt to a world of approaching nuclear parity between \nthe two superpowers, dramatic European economic recovery, the steady rise of East-West \nd\u00e9tente, and growing US preoccupation with South East Asia seemingly at the expense of \nEurope.  The awkward reality that article 13 of the North Atlantic Treaty also identified \n1969 \u2013 or NATO\u2019s 20th anniversary \u2013 as the first point when any signatory of the Treaty \ncould voluntarily withdraw from the Alliance added a further destabilizing ingredient to \nthe mix.2  \n Beneath this consensus that there was indeed a problem in Transatlantic relations, \nthere also lurks an element of contradiction, however.  This reflects, on the one hand, the \ngrowing body of archival evidence which demonstrates that many of the trends which are \nnormally associated with the reassessment of US-European relations which is said to \nhave occurred during Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger\u2019s period in charge of US \nforeign policy were evident within the Johnson administration also. And on the other, the \nemerging consensus in the historical literature that Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s European policy \n                                                 \n1\n The author would like to thank all of those who participated in the discussions at the Tampere conference \nfor their help in sharpening up the argument of this paper and Dr James Ellison for his perceptive and \nattentive reading of the text. \n2\n The Treaty text can be found at http:\/\/www.nato.int\/docu\/basictxt\/treaty.htm (accessed October 6, 2008). \nwas much less \u2018inactive\u2019 and far more successful than had often been claimed.  Certainly \nthe Johnson administration managed to avoid a major Transatlantic crisis in the later \n1960s.   Many of the ingredients for a crisis were present, and some dramatic disruption \nof Transatlantic relations was repeatedly predicted in the second half of the decade.  But \ncontrary to expectations, no major storm occurred. \n Investigating this crisis that did not happen has the additional merit of throwing \nup some useful leads to follow when looking in more detail \u2013 as multiple scholars are \ncurrently doing - at the crisis that did, namely the much more turbulent phase of \nTransatlantic relations associated with the middle years of the Nixon administration.  For \nthis article will suggest that some of the factors on the European side at least which \nhelped avert serious trouble in the 1960s, had gone into reverse by the 1970s and may \nhence help explain why the Nixon-Kissinger years were as problematic for Transatlantic \nrelations as they are generally held to have been. \n \nThere could be trouble ahead\u2026 \nThe obvious starting point for this article is to recall how much talk there was about \nTransatlantic drift in the mid to late 1960s.  At one level, of course, such mutterings were \nas old as the Atlantic Alliance itself.  Even in the period of maximum European \ndependence on the United States (in both economic and security terms) some voices on \nboth sides of the Atlantic had been raised against the development of close ties.  Such \ndissent had only grown as Western Europe rediscovered a degree of confidence and \nprosperity and started to feel less bound to follow Washington\u2019s lead. European \nmisgivings were also heightened by the rapidly changing military and technological \nbalance of power in the cold war.  There had thus been a well-documented surge in \nEuropean misgiving about the reliability of the US in the wake of Sputnik.3  There had \nbeen another after the Cuban Missile Crisis.4  And by 1964 Henry Kissinger had been \ndelivering a clever series of lectures to NATO audiences analysing the multiple structural \n                                                 \n3\n Beatrice Heuser, NATO, Britain, France and the FRG.

Press reports and television coverage of \nwhat was happening in South East Asia not only revitalised the long-standing left wing \ncritique of US imperialism, but also generated a new wave of hostility towards American \nforeign policy amongst Europe\u2019s youth.6  Disquietingly for Transatlantic relations, this \nwas not confined to countries like France and Italy which had deep-rooted traditions of \nanti-US sentiment, but had also spread to West Germany and Britain.   To see the \nAmerikaha\u00fcser in Berlin and elsewhere \u2013 institutions that had once symbolised the \ncloseness of US-German relations \u2013 singled out as targets by anti-American student \nprotestors was an alarming indication of how popular sentiment seemed to be changing.7 \n This left-wing critique was matched by the highly vociferous Gaullist challenge \nmore associated with the European right.  The details of de Gaulle\u2019s attack on the \nstructures of Atlantic cooperation have been extensively explored elsewhere.8  What \nmatters, however, when setting out the difficulties for the Atlantic Alliance and the wider \nTransatlantic relationship is that support for the  French President\u2019s sentiments was never \nrestricted solely to France, but occurred in small but influential pockets in the Federal \nRepublic, Italy and Belgium.9  Portions of the right-wing press in all three countries \ntherefore picked up de Gaulle\u2019s scepticism about the reliability of America\u2019s security \nguarantee, his dissatisfaction with the unequal nature of NATO, and his desire for a \ngreater European voice in East-West relations.  Diluted versions of both left-wing and the \nGaullist doubts about the Atlantic Alliance also percolated down into the centrist press \nacross Europe.  A succession of editorial pieces questioning NATO\u2019s solidity and future \n                                                 \n5\n These would subsequently be published as Henry Kissinger, The troubled partnership : a re-appraisal of \nthe Atlantic Alliance (Wesport: Greenwood Press, 1982) \n6\n Carole Fink, Philipp Gassert, and Detlef Junker (eds.), 1968: The World Transformed (New York: \nCambridge University Press, 1998) \n7\n Jeremi Suri, Power and Protest.

Similarly, de Gaulle\u2019s attacks on the basic inequality of the \nBretton Woods monetary system and his complaint that the US was allowed to behave in \na more fiscally irresponsible fashion than any other state, struck a responsive chord \namongst many European bankers and government officials.  In Bonn, for instance, \nanxious US officials touring European capitals in the wake of the French President\u2019s \nhighly public assault were given a degree of reassurance that the Germans would not \nslavishly follow the French but also firmly warned by Karl Blessing, the President of the \nBundesbank, \u2018the US deficit cannot last much longer and we [the US] should understand \nthis. Europe will not take much more in dollar holdings.\u201910  It was thus not just the \nFrench, nor just student radicals, who believed that America was mismanaging its status \nas the economic and military leader of the Western world and deriving unfair advantages \nfrom its pivotal position.  Sentiments of this sort, moreover, help explain why most of the \nEuropean Community member state governments were initially ready to join forces with \nthe French in the late 1960s attempt to re-balance the rules and institutions of the world \nfinancial system.11  Mutual incomprehension across the Atlantic was present in the \nfinancial sphere, as much as in that of security. \n Transatlantic tensions were further fuelled by episodes such as the Non-\nProliferation Treaty where superpower agreement was followed by multiple West-West \ndisagreements, notably between the United States and West Germany.12  Not only was \nthe NPT the result of bilateral dialogue between the superpowers and hence something \nwhich reinforced Europeans\u2019 sense of marginalisation in cold war affairs.  The fears of \nUS-Soviet condominium in world affairs which would be so much a symptom of \nTransatlantic tension in the 1970s, were thus already evident in the mid to late-1960s.  In \nthe German case, the NPT was also definitive confirmation of the country\u2019s prohibition \nfrom holding nuclear weapons.  It thus emphasised not merely the gap between the \nFederal Republic and the superpowers, but also Germany\u2019s military inferiority vis-\u00e0-vis \n                                                 \n10\n Cited in Francis Gavin, Gold, Dollars and Power.

At a time of growing German self-\nconfidence and awareness of its economic out-performance of both the UK and France, \nthis was a bitter pill to swallow.  In the heated domestic German debate which \nsurrounded the NPT, the Treaty was compared to the Morganthau Plan \u2013 the US wartime \nscheme for dismembering Germany.13 \n Such European voices meanwhile were given added credibility by the increasing \ndoubts about Washington\u2019s European engagement at the level of US opinion.  The most \ncelebrated expression of doubt was probably Senator Mansfield\u2019s long-lasting campaign \nto use Congressional votes to force the US government to reduce the number of troops \nstationed in Western Europe.14  But it was a problem which reached well beyond a \nsomewhat maverick senator and affected a much wider portion of US public opinion.  \nWhen President Johnson met the German Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger in April 1967 \nhe expressed concern about some of the hostility and mistrust of the US which he had \nbeen informed about in the European press and then continued: \u2018While this was going on \nin Germany there was a similar type of \"unfaithful husband-wife\" thinking towards \nGermany in the United States. People were saying to themselves: Why should we \ncontinue to spend over a million dollars? Why should we keep on maintaining our troops \nthere? Why should we not let them handle their own defense? They are grown up now. \nThey have rebuilt their countries. They can take care of themselves. They have a better \nbalance of payments situation. Why should we stay if de Gaulle feels we should get out, \nif the Germans doubt us? Why should we not talk to them in terms of the 20th century, in \nterms of planes and rockets rather than in 19th century terms of ground troops? If they are \nlooking for defense protection by the French, why not let them do just that?\u201915 \n Under the surface moreover there were real elements of doubt creeping into the \nTransatlantic relationship, on both sides of the Atlantic.  Thus, for example, US Secretary \nof Treasury Henry Fowler\u2019s critique of the \u2018inward-looking\u2019 Community which \ndisregarded US economic interests foreshadowed some of the criticism of Europe\u2019s \neconomic approach associated with the Nixon rethink and in particular with Secretary \n                                                 \n13\n Ibid. 113 \n14\n Don Oberdorfer, Senator Mansfield: The Extraordinary Life of a Great Statesman and Diplomat \n(Washington: Smithsonian Books, 2003) 387-91 \n15\n Foreign Relations of the United States, 1964-8, volume 15 (Washington: Department of State) document \n214 \nJohn Connelly\u2019s approach. In the aftermath of an inconclusive National Security Council \ndiscussion of US policy to Europe in 1967, Fowler wrote to the President: \u2018If the United \nStates is to be effective in partnership with Western Europe and we are to avoid a two-\nbloc system in the Free World, the relative burdens much be attuned to financial viability.  \nThe purpose and thrust of our major political and diplomatic effort much be to effect a \nmore viable and durable financial partnership than our diplomacy has provided in the last \ndecade since the Common Market was established.\u201916  Likewise other members of the \nJohnson administration were increasingly outspoken about the need for greater \u2018burden \nsharing\u2019 between Europe and America and the seeming trend for Europe to disregard \nglobal dangers (notably in Vietnam) in favour of tending its own garden.  Walt Rostow \nfor instance commented that \u2018Europe is neglecting the world.  It is in an isolationist \ncycle.\u201917 The gap between the US with its global interests and Europe with its regional \nones of which Kissinger would famously and controversially speak in 1973, was in other \nwords already perceived by many in Washington five or six years before the Year of \nEurope speech.18 \n Likewise, a certain tendency to ignore the institutions of multilateral Europe was \nalready visible in Washington well before the hand-over from Johnson to Nixon.  Nixon\u2019s \nfailure to make time to see Jean Rey, the European Commission President, when the \nlatter visited Washington in 1969 \u2013 an incident which caused a great deal of soul-\nsearching in Brussels \u2013 could easily have occurred under LBJ.19  The latter had been \nhighly reluctant to meet Rey two years earlier, delegating the task of receiving the new \nCommission President to his Vice President, and had needed to be persuaded by Rostow \nto make space in his diary.20  Again therefore a trend later denounced as an unfortunate \ncharacteristic of the Nixon\/Kissinger approach to foreign affairs, had been foreshadowed \nwithin the Johnson administration. \n All of this helped ensure that early writing about the period did tend to argue that \nthe Johnson years were a problematic time for US-European relations.  There had been \n                                                 \n16\n Foreign Relations of the United States, 1964-68, volume 13, 578 \n17\n Ibid. 574 \n18\n See Jussi Hanhimaki, Flawed Architect: Henry Kissinger and American Foreign Policy (Oxford: Oxford \nUniversity Press, 2004) 275-277 \n19\n European Commission Historical Archives, Brussels, COM(69) PV 83, 2e partie, 24-5.6.1969 \n20\n LBJ Presidential Library, Austin, Texas, NSF Country Files, Box 163, Europe (Folder 5), Rostow to \nJohnson, 23.10.1967 \nno major blow-up perhaps, but Johnson\u2019s mind was elsewhere \u2013 whether focusing on \ndomestic priorities or on the ever more preoccupying situation in Vietnam - and his skills \nwere ill-suited for the niceties of West-West diplomacy.  Relations with his major \nWestern European contemporaries had thus been generally poor: the LBJ-Wilson rapport \nwas distant and cool compared with that between Macmillan and Kennedy, while the \nTexan President\u2019s handling of Ludwig Erhard, the German Chancellor, had contributed \nsignificantly to the latter\u2019s fall from power in 1966.  Relations with de Gaulle, which \nwould always have been problematic, were meanwhile made even more difficult by the \ntotal lack of cultural understanding between the two men.21  Lawrence Kaplan\u2019s book on \nNATO would be a typical example of this trend.  Recently, however this viewpoint has \nbeen stood on its head. The dominant view of recent scholarly literature on Transatlantic \nrelations in the later 1960s has been that LBJ was much less ineffective when it came to \nEurope than has normally been asserted. \n The revisionism on this began with Schwartz\u2019s book Lyndon Johnson and \nEurope: In the Shadow of Vietnam.  This did its best to demonstrate that LBJ neither \nignored, nor mishandled relations with his European allies.  The links with Germany and \nBritain continued to be quite intensive and generally cordial, and the French problem, \nwhile certainly not solved, was at least contained and prevented from infecting the \nAtlantic alliance more widely.22  The trend continued with Andreas Wenger\u2019s work on \nthe Harmel exercise, which again painted a picture of US activism and effectiveness on \nthis issue at odds with the traditional caricature.23  Andrew Priest\u2019s study of Anglo-\nAmerican relations chimed in with much the same conclusion, while Hubert \nZimmermann\u2019s detailed study of the off-set issue, while illustrating quite how fraught \nthese negotiations proved to be, ultimately presented them as an obstacle that was \novercome, rather than one which did lasting damage to US-German relations.24  And this \n                                                 \n21\n See de Gaulle\u2019s comments cited in Alain Peyrefitte, C\u2019\u00e9tait de Gaulle, vol. 2 (Paris: Fayard, 1997), p.61 \n22\n Thomas A.

This \nconcludes that \u2018in their activities, separately and jointly, the Americans and British had \nplayed leading roles in stabilising the West in 1967.\u201925  Most of the recent research in \nother words has tended to vindicate Walt Rostow who had written to LBJ as he stepped \ndown in 1969 to compliment him on leaving NATO \u2018in extremely good shape for your \nsuccessor, given de Gaulle, Vietnam, balance of payments, etc\u2019. \n Furthermore, this historical judgement is borne out by the actual record of events \nin the later 1960s which does not really provide much evidence of any serious breakdown \nat a Transatlantic level.  On the contrary, de Gaulle\u2019s challenge had been countered and \nturned to NATO\u2019s advantage through the Harmel exercise.  The alliance seemed \ngenuinely to have reinvented itself and was actively exploring its new d\u00e9tente vocation \nand plotting a joint response to persistent Eastern Bloc calls for a European Security \nconference.  No country would hence avail itself of the twenty year abrogation clause \nwhich had been included in the original 1949 North Atlantic Treaty. Relations also \nremained strong between the US and the EEC, the Six having not only proved capable of \ndelivering an acceptable conclusion of the Kennedy Round, but also of complying with \nthe subsequent US request to speed up the implementation of the trade accord.26  The \nongoing closeness of ties between the European Commission and Washington had also \nbeen seemingly confirmed by the GATT negotiations.27  And the Bretton Woods system, \nwhile still unreformed, had a least temporarily weathered the storms of 1968 and 1969.28  \nEuropean support for the US dollar reached its apogee with the Blessing Note of March \n1967 in which the President of the Bundesbank undertook not to seek to convert \nGermany\u2019s substantial dollar holdings into gold.

And the French found themselves \nsteadily less able to corral the Six into a unified bloc in 1967-8 as their parallel \ndisagreements with their European \u2018partners\u2019 over other subjects proliferated.29 \n So why was there no crisis?  Why were all the doom-mongers \u2013 but also those \nmore dispassionate analysts who discerned deep structural difficulties in a partnership \nforged during the high point of the cold war, but now exposed to the very different \nstresses and strains of d\u00e9tente \u2013 wrong (or at least premature) in their pessimism? \n Part of the answer doubtless lies on the American side and the nature of the LBJ \napproach.  This is a field which the present author intends to explore over the next few \nyears, but about which he still knows far too little yet to venture very much by way of an \nexplanation.  But this article will also contend that there were a number of factors on the \nEuropean side which contributed to the crisis that did not happen (and the disappearance \nof which hence contributed to the one that did during the Nixon-Kissinger era).  And it is \nhence on these European elements in the overall answer that the rest of this contribution \nwill dwell. \n The first European ingredient which helped prevent a major breakdown in \nTransatlantic relations from occurring during the Johnson years was the perversely \nunifying effect of de Gaulle.   The French President certainly wanted to be seen as \nsomeone who was seeking to weaken the solidity of the Atlantic Alliance and of the US \nleadership role in Europe.  He was also regarded by his contemporaries, and has been \ntreated by most historians, as a genuine threat to the Atlanticist status quo.  But in many \nways the extremism of the positions which he adopted towards the Americans and the \ntactlessness which he displayed towards his potential allies elsewhere in Europe repelled \nthese last and drove them back towards Washington.  The would-be liberator of Europe \nfrom the US yoke, may in effect, have helped consolidate rather than weaken \nTransatlantic ties. \n                                                 \n29\n Garret Martin, \u2018\u201dGrandeur et d\u00e9pendences\u201d: the dilemmas of Gaullist foreign policy, September 1967 to \nApril 1968\u2019 in N. Piers Ludlow (ed.), European Integration and the Cold War: Ostpolitik\/Westpolitik \n1965-1973 (London: Routledge, 2007), 43-49 \n In the nuclear field, de Gaulle\u2019s relentless attacks on US strategic doctrine and the \nreliability of the American guarantee, confronted those who were genuinely interested in \nthe development of a European nuclear force, with an increasingly stark choice between a \nvery powerful and fully extent US nuclear umbrella, and a putative and much less \npowerful French force de frappe.  No serious military analyst could recommend the latter \nover the former.  In Germany, for instance, that minority who were genuinely tempted by \nthe idea of transforming the French nuclear force into a genuinely independent European \ndeterrent, found it hard to overcome the widespread awareness that Paris could offer little \nmore than what was condescendingly dubbed a \u2018Sahara-B\u00f6mbchen\u2019 \u2013 a diminutive bomb \ntested in the North African desert.30  Choosing this \u2018little bang\u2019 as Erhard put it, over the \nUS\u2019 \u2018big bang\u2019, made very little sense.31 \n Politically, the French leader\u2019s high-handed manner convinced most of his would-\nbe partners that any European cooperation in which they participated would not be \nEuropean cooperation at all, but simply the replacement of US leadership with French \nleadership.  And again powerful and distant Washington, for all its flaws, was a distinctly \npreferable alternative to a France which was arrogant, tactless, and actually not really \nvery powerful at all.  And economically de Gaulle\u2019s overstated campaign against the \nBretton Woods system turned what might have become a genuinely prescient European \ncritique of both US fiscal irresponsibility and the asymmetry of the international \nmonetary system, into a rant with which few other Europeans wanted to be closely \nassociated.  The notion of returning to a reliance on gold as the central pivot of the \nsystem also gave unintentional force to the standard anti-Gaullist line that the French \nPresident was a backward looking statesman whose views were more appropriate for the \nnineteenth century than the twentieth. Furthermore, when the French did moderate their \nviewpoint somewhat and managed to persuade their partners to join them on a concerted \nquest to lessen the perceived under-representation of Europe in the IMF and the other \nBretton Woods institutions, Paris then undermined the collective effort by picking new \nfights with its monetary allies over unrelated issues like British EEC membership.32 \n                                                 \n30\n Cited in Benedikt Schoenborn, La m\u00e9sentente apprivois\u00e9e.

As one Italian diplomat would put it in \nearly 1963 (straight after the first Gaullist crisis hit Europe), \u2018Il padrone pi\u00f9 ricco e pi\u00f9 \nlontano \u00e8 sempre il migliore.\u2019 (The best boss is always he who is richest and further \naway.)33 And this judgement would persist until 1969. France was just too close and too \nthreadbare a pretender seriously to challenge US dominance. \n A second important, if unintentional, stabilising factor was the non-appearance of \nany form of European political unity.  Washington always claimed that it supported the \nnotion of Western Europe developing a greater degree of political as well as economic \nunity.  Kennedy\u2019s ringing \u2018declaration of interdependence\u2019 speech in Philadelphia on July \n4, 1962 asserted, for instance:  \nWe do not regard a strong and united Europe as a rival but as a partner. To aid its \nprogress has been the basic object of our foreign policy for 17 years. We believe \nthat a united Europe will be capable of playing a greater role in the common \ndefense, of responding more generously to the needs of poorer nations, of joining \nwith the United States and others in lowering trade barriers, resolving problems of \ncommerce, commodities, and currency, and developing coordinated policies in all \neconomic, political, and diplomatic areas. We see in such a Europe a partner with \nwhom we can deal on a basis of full equality in all the great and burdensome tasks \nof building and defending a community of free nations.34 \n \nAnd for some at least, especially in the State Department, this was almost certainly \nsincere.35  But as some perceptive US observers recognised the actual appearance of a \nstructure which might coordinate the stance of European countries could pose serious \nquestions about the existing Transatlantic relationship.  As Lawrence Kaplan put it in \nearly 1965: \u2018we would be concerned if any such negotiation weakened rather than \nstrengthened NATO, were to lead to an inward-orientated \u201csmall Europe\u201d with the \ncharacteristic of excluding the British for all time, did not promote European integration \n                                                 \n33\n Cited by Leopoldo Nuti, Gli Stati Uniti e l\u2019apertura a sinistra.

The well-known Fouchet Plan of 1961 (itself a formalisation of \nFrench ideas expressed as early as 1959) was thus followed by multiple German, Italian \nand Belgian calls for greater foreign policy coordination during the mid-1960s, tentative \nBritish plans for reviving the Fouchet Plan as an anti-de Gaulle weapon in 1968, and a \nshort-lived attempt pioneered by Harmel in 1969 to use the seven-nation Western \nEuropean Union for this purpose.37  But none of these ventures ever got off the drawing \nboard.  As a result, for the duration of the 1960s, the US never had to contend with a \ncoordinated European stance on any political issues - in marked contradistinction to trade \nmatters and to a lesser extent monetary issues where such coordination occurred and did \nhave a serious impact upon the Transatlantic balance of power. \n Even an increasingly distracted America, more concerned with events in South \nEast Asia than with a seemingly stable Europe, had more than enough clout and \ndiplomatic savvy to dismiss unilateral foreign policy moves by individual European \nstates.   The meagre results of the multiple European attempts to mediate in the Vietnam \nWar during the 1960s bear testament to this reality.38  European political disunity hence \ncontributed to the easy continuation of US leadership and also, therefore, to the stability \nof the Atlantic Alliance during the Johnson era. \n A third contributing factor was the very slow British acceptance of the status of a \nEuropean power.  Viewed with hindsight, the 1960s can be read as an era when \nsuccessive British governments gradually came to terms with the impossibility of the UK \nretaining its global role and transferred an increasing amount of their attention and \nambition to the European scene.39  Indeed even at the time many British leaders were \n                                                 \n36\n Foreign Relations of the United States, 1964-8, volume XIII, 185 \n37\n On Fouchet see Robert Bloes, Le Plan Fouchet et le probl\u00e8me de l\u2019Europe politique (Bruges: College of \nEurope, 1970); on the mid-1960s plans Carine Germond, \u2018Les projets d\u2019Union politique de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1964\u2019 in \nWilfried Loth, Crises and Compromises: The European Project 1963-1969 (Baden-Baden: Nomos, 2001); \nfor the late 1960s schemes, Melissa Pine, Harold Wilson and Europe : pursuing Britain\u2019s membership of \nthe European Community (London: Tauris Academic Studies, 2007) \n38\n See Maurice Va\u00efsse and Christopher Goscha, La guerre de Vietnam et l\u2019Europe, 1963-1973 (Brussels: \nBruylant, 2003) \n39\n John W.

Macmillan began the trend, Wilson would continue it, and Edward Heath \nwould take it to its logical conclusion in the early 1970s.  But this change took more or \nless the whole decade to occur.  The British governments themselves took a while to \nswallow the full implications.  The arrival of a Labour government in 1964 delayed \nmatters for at least a couple of years while Harold Wilson had to \u2018re-learn\u2019 the lessons \nthat Macmillan had already been forced to swallow.40 British public opinion also took \ntime to adjust.  And most fundamentally the alternative policy \u2013 that of \u2018entering Europe\u2019 \n\u2013 was twice barred by de Gaulle. \n As a result, for much of the 1960s Britain found itself in an odd free-floating \nposition somewhere between the US and continental Europe.  This was not a comfortable \nposition to occupy and it led to a great deal of soul-searching and irritation on the part of \nthose responsible for charting the UK\u2019s foreign policy.  But paradoxically this mid-\nAtlantic position did both allow and encourage the British to play the role of intermediary \nat several potentially awkward moments in Transatlantic relations, notably that in 1966-7 \nanalysed by Ellison.41  Furthermore, the non-resolution of the Britain and Europe \nquestion distracted many of those who might otherwise have been able to give thought to \nevolving Transatlantic relations, encouraged the postponement of any serious Atlantic \nrethink until the European architecture was clearer, and added a further obstacle to the \ndevelopment of European political union, since several countries, notably the Dutch, \ninsisted in what is sometimes called le pr\u00e9alable anglais \u2013 i.e. the insistence that British \ninvolvement was a precondition for any move towards European foreign policy \ncoordination.42 \n A fourth factor was the relatively inconsequential nature of Western European \ncontacts with the Eastern bloc.  The 1960s were a time when multiple leaders, from de \nGaulle to Wilson, sought to take advantage of d\u00e9tente to show that Europe could still \nhave an impact on East-West affairs.  Their collective impact, however, was minimal.  De \nGaulle was perhaps the highest profile, but while his visits to the Eastern Bloc were PR \n                                                 \n40\n Helen Parr, Britain\u2019s policy toward the European community : Harold Wilson and Britain\u2019s world role , \n1964-1967 (London: Routledge, 2004) \n41\n Ellison, The United States, Britain and the Transatlantic crisis \n42\n On the Dutch stance see Jeffrey Vanke, \u2018An Impossible Union: Dutch Objections to the Fouchet Plan, \n1959-62\u2019, Cold War History 2\/1 (2001), 95-112 \ncoups, their substantive outcomes disappointed the French and were seen as of little \nconsequence by both Moscow itself and by the satellites.43  The one country which could \nhave had a serious impact on East-West relations \u2013 West Germany \u2013 was still hamstrung \nby its internal debate about how far such dialogue could go.44  But while the unwinding \nof the Hallstein Doctrine was apparent from the mid-1960s onwards and the internal SPD \nreflection about how different Germany\u2019s approach to the Eastern bloc should be was \nalready far advanced, a genuinely effective neue Ostpolitik would have to await 1969 and \nthe assumption of the Chancellorship by Willy Brandt.45 \n Meanwhile the other possible way in which Europe could have had a major \nimpact upon East-West relations, namely the engagement of multilateral d\u00e9tente was also \nimpossible until the early 1970s.  Serious Western consideration of a European security \nconference had begun before the 1960s came to an end.46  But it would take several years \nand multiple complex preconditions before such an event could open. The area of cold \nwar politics where the US was likely to be most sensitive, namely that of East-West \nrelations, therefore remained something of a superpower chasse gard\u00e9e throughout the \ndecade.  A few individual European statesmen did try to get involved.  But they had \nprecious little real impact and in no sense disturbed either superpower. \n A fifth rather more short term factor might be added to the list in the form of \nSoviet actions in crushing the Prague Spring.  For while the 1968 crisis did not interrupt \nfor long the movement at both superpower and European levels towards greater East-\nWest d\u00e9tente, it did serve temporarily to revive fears of Soviet military power, and hence \nhighlight the residual military utility of NATO.47   It thus provided an additional reason \nwhy the 1969 reform or withdrawal opportunity within the Alliance was allowed to go \npast without any country making an attempt to use it.   The USSR\u2019s brutal suppression of \nthe Prague Spring also underlined the ineffective results of de Gaulle\u2019s efforts to build \n                                                 \n43\n Martin, \u2018Untying the Gaullian Knot\u2019, chapters 2, 5 & 6 \n44\n William Glen Gray, Germany\u2019s Cold War : the global campaign to isolate East Germany, 1949-1969 \n(Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2003) \n45\n For the evolution of SPD ideas, see Arne Hofmann, The Emergence of D\u00e9tente in Europe: Brandt, \nKennedy and the formation of Ostpolitik (London: Routledge, 2007) \n46\n See Takeshi Yamamoto, \u2018The Road to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, 1969-\n1973: Britain, France and West Germany\u2019, PhD thesis, University of London, 2007. \n47\n See Andreas Wenger, \u2018NATO\u2019s transformation in the 1960s and the ensuing political order in Europe\u2019 in \nAndreas Wenger, Christian Neunlist and Anna Locher (eds), Transforming NATO in the Cold War. \nChallenges beyond deterrence in the 1960s (London: Routledge, 2007), 237 \nbridges towards the Eastern bloc.  The French President\u2019s foreign policy radicalism had \nalready been hard hit by the Paris \u00e9venements of May 1968 and by the steady \naccumulation of resentment towards Gaullist France which had robbed it of any European \nallies in particular.  But it was the end of the Prague Spring which signalled most clearly \nthe General\u2019s demise as a serious would-be threat to the status quo.  This too brought a \nshort term rise in the stability of the Western bloc. \n The Prague effect would not last long, however, and all four other factors \nmentioned would soon go into reverse.  Between 1969 and 1971, de Gaulle would resign, \nEuropean Political Cooperation would be launched, Britain would appear to take a firm \n(although, as it turned out, far from definitive) decision for European engagement, and \nBrandt\u2019s Ostpolitik and the start of decisive moves towards the beginning of multilateral \nd\u00e9tente would signal the beginning of an important European component of East-West \ndialogue.  This would therefore suggest that when historians seek to understand why \nTransatlantic relations became that much more turbulent during the Nixon\/Kissinger \nperiod than they had been under Johnson, they should seek their answer not simply in the \nchanged attitudes of the American government (vital though these undoubtedly were) but \nalso in a radically different set of conditions in Western Europe.   \n"}
