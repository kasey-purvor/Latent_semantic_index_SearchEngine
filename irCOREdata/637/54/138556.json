Introduction\nWith many markets becoming volatile and difficult to predict, the focus of supply chain\nmanagement has needed to \u201cshift from the idea of cost as an order winner to responsiveness\nas the market winner\u201d (Christopher and Towill, 2002, p1). Cost, however, remains a market\nqualifier in such situations (Mason-Jones et al., 2000) and therefore agile supply chains are\nfaced with the twin pressures of providing greater responsiveness whilst keeping costs at a\nlow level.\nIn general, the minimisation of inventory is key to achieving these objectives, by means,\nfor example, of substituting information for inventory (Christopher, 1998). Distribution\ncentres thus need to assist the rapid flow of goods through the supply chain, using techniques\nsuch as transhipping between warehouse sites (Herer et al., 2002) or cross docking and in-\ntransit merging (van Hoek, 2001). Production postponement at the distribution centres may\nalso be part of this agile strategy (Marvick and White, 1998), including such activities as final\npackaging, labelling and configuration to customer requirements (Maltz and DeHoratius,\n2004).\nHowever, national statistics indicate that inventory has remained at a constant level in\nrecent years, in relation to changes in Gross Domestic Product, in the US and UK economies\n(Frazelle, 2002a; Office for National Statistics, 2005), whilst empirical research has indicated\nthat the use of cross docking and postponement is somewhat limited (Baker, 2004). In fact, it\n4is recognised that the holding of inventory may form part of an agile strategy as decoupling\npoints may be useful to separate lean manufacturing practices (which are more effective in\nstable supply situations) from downstream agile supply chains that serve volatile market\nplaces (Naylor et al., 1999). This need for decoupling points is becoming increasingly\nimportant with global sourcing which tends to be associated with increased lead times.\nThe purpose of this paper is to explore how companies are in fact responding to the need\nfor agility, particularly as regards how they design and operate their distribution centres to\nsupport their responsiveness to the market. Modern distribution centres are frequently very\nlarge in size as a result of the benefits of consolidating inventory and the long supply lines\nresulting from global sourcing (Harrison and van Hoek, 2005). These large distribution\ncentres frequently contain significant levels of automated equipment in order to contain\noperating costs within such complex sites (Pfohl et al., 1992). With the warehouse buildings\nhaving approximately a 25 year depreciation period in companies\u2019 accounts and the\nequipment about a 5 to 10 year depreciation period, reconciling this long life of assets with\nsupply chain agility is a significant issue.\n2. Context\nAgility is a business-wide concept that has its origins in manufacturing flexibility (Aitken\net al., 2002). It may be described as a \u201cmanagement concept centered around responsiveness\nto dynamic and turbulent markets and customer demand\u201d (Van Hoek et al., 2001, p146).\nIndeed, agility involves not only responding to changing market conditions but exploiting and\ntaking advantage of these changes as opportunities (Sharifi and Zhang, 1999).\nWhilst the concept therefore addresses particular types of markets (Childerhouse and\nTowill, 2000), the need for agility is becoming increasingly important as product life cycles\n5shorten and global economic and competitive pressures lead to additional uncertainty\n(Christopher, 2000). In this environment, companies need to locate inventory and capacity at\nstrategic points in the supply chain to facilitate the flow of goods to market (Stratton and\nWarburton, 2003).\nIn order to provide this responsiveness, firms require flexible capabilities across a number\nof areas, such as product development, manufacturing and logistics. Within each area,\nspecific competencies are required to provide these capabilities (Zhang et al., 2002). A well-\nknown example of a competence at distribution centre level was documented by Stalk et al.,\n(1992), namely Wal-Mart\u2019s cross-docking logistics operation, which enabled goods to be\n\u201cpulled\u201d by consumer sales data directly from suppliers. In fact, the whole logistics operation\ncan be viewed as a resource base within a firm to support new strategic positions such as sales\nexpansion and new marketing channels (Abrahamsson et al., 2003). Where these resources\nare not perfectly imitable by competitors then they may present a source of competitive\nadvantage to the firm (Barney, 1991). With the long life of warehouse assets, it is thus\npossible that distribution centres may either form a severe constraint on future flexibility or\nprovide a significant advantage, by facilitating a response to market changes that competitors\nmay find difficult to imitate.\nWhilst there are some differences in the precise understanding of the terms agility and\nflexibility (Abrahamsson et al., 2003), the starting point for this research is the capability to\nrespond to three types of agility that have been described by van Hoek (2001), namely:\n- Volume variance, for example caused by seasonality, product life cycles and end\nconsumer demand fluctuations.\n- Time variance, for example urgent orders.\n- Quantity variance, for example small orders, possibly at item rather than case level.\n6These variances represent different logistics challenges and therefore the competencies\nrequired to be able to respond to each in a cost effective and timely manner may, in turn, be\nquite different in nature.\nIn examining the required competencies, distribution centres may be viewed as part of a\nwider system i.e. the whole supply chain that forms part of a company\u2019s competitive\nframework (Christopher, 1998). Stevens (1989) recognised the different system levels of\nsupply chains and particularly the inherent need for integration at the external (e.g. with\nsuppliers and customers), internal (e.g. with manufacturing) and functional (e.g. within\ndistribution) levels. This systems approach corresponds to the framework used in analyzing\nmanufacturing flexibility, by, for example, Yussuf et al., (1999) who proposed three levels of\nagility, namely inter-enterprise, enterprise and resource levels, and by Koste and Malhotra\n(1999) who examined five tiers ranging from the strategic business unit through to individual\nresource (e.g. machine) level.\nAt the distribution function level, distribution centres are frequently part of a network of\nwarehouses serving the customers. The design of these networks involves such decisions as\nthe number, size and location of warehouses, as well as whether they should be owned, leased\nor outsourced (Lambert et al., 1998). At the level of the individual distribution centres, the\nnecessary resources include labour, space, materials handling equipment, and information\nsystems, as well as the integration of these resources, in terms of processes (Frazelle, 2002a).\nThese lead to a hierarchical structure for examining distribution competencies as shown\nin Fig. 1, set out in a similar format to that described for manufacturing flexibilities by Koste\nand Malhotra (1999).\n[Insert Fig. 1 about here]\n7Whilst this paper focuses on how distribution centres are designed and operated to\nprovide agility, the wider system responses are also examined as these normally form part of\nan integrated solution.\n3. Research method\nThe research in this paper was based on case studies of six European companies, five in\nthe fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector and one in publishing (serving booksellers\nand academic institutions). Where separate business units had distinctly different supply\nchains, it was decided that the business unit would be the appropriate unit of analysis. In\ntotal, nine business units were examined from the six companies. The focus in all case studies\nwas on outbound distribution.\nThe first part of the research was undertaken by semi-structured interviews with directors\nor senior managers examining their view as to the nature of the requirement for agility in their\nsupply chains. The interviews were based on the three categories, plus sub-categories, of\nagility identified by van Hoek (2001). In addition, the interviewees were given the\nopportunity to add any other categories of agility that they believed were relevant for their\nparticular operation. The exact requirement of these agility types was explored with the\ncompanies, and each sub-category was assessed by the interviewees on a Likert scale of 1 to\n5. Metrics were recorded where appropriate, as a record of the degree of agility required (for\nexample, for seasonality, the ratio of peak to average volumes was recorded). This relatively\nstraight-forward method was adopted as the main purpose of the research is to explore the\nresponses to perceived agility requirements, rather than measure the degree of agility itself,\nfor which other possible methods may be appropriate, such as the use of fuzzy logic (Lin et\nal., 2006).\n8The second part of the research was conducted during visits to representative distribution\ncentres within the networks of the business units. The distribution centres included two\nEuropean Distribution Centres (EDCs), four National Distribution Centres (NDCs) and three\nRegional Distribution Centres (RDCs), serving parts of the UK. These facilities were within\nthe UK, except for the EDC and an associated NDC, which were located in Poland. The site\nvisits involved undertaking a familiarisation tour of the facility, recording the operational\ndetails on a survey form used in previous research and conducting semi-structured interviews\nwith the distribution centre managers (or appropriate senior managers). The semi-structured\ninterviews were based on the types of agility identified during the interviews with supply\nchain management, having scored 3 or above on the 5-point Likert scale during those\ninterviews. For each of these types of agility, the distribution centre manager was asked how\nthe warehouse was designed and operated to meet the particular requirement. The results\nwere set out within the competency framework outlined in Fig. 1.\nA workshop was then held, attended by representatives from five of the six companies.\nAt this workshop each company was given the opportunity to refine its responses in the light\nof the additional categories of agility identified during the research. In addition, the results\nwere discussed in the form of the hierarchical framework and some initial conclusions were\ndeveloped.\n4. Research companies\nThe nine business units taking part in the research were drawn from the manufacturing,\nwholesaling, retailing and direct selling sectors, as set out in Table 1.\n[Insert Table 1 about here]\n94.1. Argos Direct: Non-food, non-fashion direct delivery\nTwo business units of Argos Direct were included in this research.\nArgos Direct, Delivery Only (ADDO) covers items delivered directly to a consumer\u2019s\nhome, where two people are required for delivery owing to the weight or nature of the item.\nThe distribution network of ADDO comprises two RDCs; these being located at Stafford and\nBedford, with the latter being the focus of this research and comprising 665,000 sq ft (61,800\nm2) in floor area. Whilst seasonality and product life cycles were important issues for this\nbusiness unit, the accommodation of growth has presented a particular challenge owing to the\nlarge cubic measurement of the product lines.\nThe long lead times resulting from the geographic location of many of the suppliers (e.g.\nin the Far East) has limited the extent to which inventory holding levels can be tackled at the\nsupply chain and business unit level. The distribution network has thus been expanded by\nmeans of additional warehouse area. This has been achieved by renting additional warehouse\nspace and by building an additional RDC (which is managed by a third-party operator). At\nthe distribution centre level, the additional warehouse space has been designed with the nature\nof the goods and flexibility in mind, comprising mainly wide-aisle adjustable pallet racking\nand block stacking.\nArgos Direct, Stocked In (ADSI) covers items that can be delivered directly to a\nconsumer\u2019s home by the driver alone, where these items have typically been ordered by\nInternet or telephone.\n10\nThe ADSI distribution network also comprises two RDCs, located at Tipton and Welwyn\nGarden City; the latter being the focus of this research and comprising 160,000 sq ft (14,900\nm2). The business unit perceived seasonality and product life cycles as the two key areas of\nagility required in its supply chain, accentuated by rapid growth in recent years. There are\ntwo catalogues per year with about one third of the 8,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs)\nchanging for each catalogue. The peak season throughput is about 3 times above the average\nlevel for the year.\nChanges of this magnitude required careful planning and co-ordination at all levels.\nSome examples included the following. At the supply chain level, suppliers were requested to\nhold stock and deliver in more frequently. The catalogue changes were coordinated at the\nbusiness unit level, involving merchandising, purchasing and logistics functions. At the\ndistribution network level, changes were made to the RDC delivery areas, whilst at the\ndistribution centre level, there were staff and process changes (such as pickers loading large\nitems directly onto the vehicles at peak periods).\n4.2 Argos Stores: Non-food, non-fashion retailer\nArgos operates 580 stores in the United Kingdom and Eire from a network of 6 Regional\nDistribution Centres, 3 National Distribution Centres, 2 Direct Import Centres and 2 \u201cExtra\u201d\nDistribution Centres (for their extended product range at large stores). In total, about 13,500\nSKUs are supplied to the stores. The focus of the distribution centre level research was a\n340,000 sq ft (31,600 m2) RDC located at Lutterworth in Central England.\nThe company has experienced rapid growth, with double-digit sales growth in each of the\nlast four years. The distribution network infrastructure has been expanded and restructured to\naccommodate this growth. Five distribution centres were opened and one closed, adding a net\n11\n1.3 million sq ft (121,000 m2) to the warehousing capacity, within a three year period. Up\nuntil this period, all warehousing was undertaken in-house, but the increased pace of business\nresulted in the normal 18-30 month time span to plan, build and commission a new building\nwas not sufficiently agile. The decision was therefore taken to use third party logistics\ncontractors where greater speed was required. The third party logistics (3PL) contractors\noften had warehouses readily available of about the right size in approximately the right\nlocation and also had the management and staff resources to react quickly. Thus, during this\nperiod, two 3PL warehouses were opened with different contractors, one of 225,000 sq ft\n(21,000 m2) and the other of 325,000 sq ft (30,200 m2). Each warehouse was operational\nwithin 6-7 months of starting the project planning.\nOn the other hand, where expansion was part of a long-term strategic plan, it was decided\nto continue on the in-house route. One example of this was a 650,000 sq ft (60,400 m2)\ndistribution centre that was opened to act as a national Distribution Centre for small items, an\nImport Centre (comprising a 90,000 pallet high bay) and a Returns Centre.\n4.3 Avon Cosmetics: manufacturer and direct seller\nThe research examined two business units.\nAvon Europe distributes goods to the company\u2019s national operations from its 86,100 sq ft\n(8,000 m2) EDC located at its Garwolin manufacturing plant in Poland. The throughput of the\nEDC has grown rapidly since it became operational in 2000. This growth has partly been\naccommodated by detailed operational planning software, developed in addition to the\nWarehouse Management System. This has enabled the EDC to be effective at near capacity\nlevels, particularly at peak seasonal periods. A further challenge has been the change in the\n12\nquantities ordered with more case picking now needed from the largely narrow aisle pallet\nstore. This has been achieved in part by changes in picking process, such as case picking\nfrom drop pallets.\nAvon Polska serves representatives in the Polish market from its 94,700 sq ft (8,800 m2)\nwarehouse, again co-located at the Garwolin site. This is largely an item pick operation,\nutilizing flow racks and conveyors. A major challenge has been the very seasonal and\npromotional nature of the goods. This has been handled by close internal business unit level\nco-ordination and by reviewing and changing the Pareto classifications of the goods on a\nregular monthly basis. The latter involves moving the pick locations of goods so that the new\nfast-moving lines are located in the prime pick slots, whilst lines that have finished their\npromotional activity are relocated to slower moving slots.\n4.4 Blueheath: internet wholesaler\nThis is a fairly new company, established in 2000, to serve independent and multiple\ngrocery retailers. The company has experienced rapid growth, aided by its focus on\ninformation technology in such areas as inventory control and customer communications.\nThe distribution operation has been set up as a flexible network of companies, with separate\ncontracts in place for warehousing, ambient, chilled and frozen deliveries. The transport\noperation makes use of spare capacity in existing operations and this aids volume flexibility\nand growth. The warehousing uses 90,000 sq ft (8,400 m2) of a 138,000 sq ft (12,800 m2)\nshared user third party logistics facility at Tamworth, operated by Gist, and this again\nprovides flexibility for future growth. Up to 50% temporary staff is used at peak to provide\nresponsiveness to demand variance.\n13\n4.5 Major retailer\nIn order to provide a more agile response to its 1400 stores, this major non-food retailer\nhas worked closely with a 3PL provider to develop a logistics solution. A major challenge\nhas been that of quantity variance, as the operation has moved from pack replenishment to\nitem replenishment for its medium and slow moving lines, which are stocked at a 136,000 sq\nft (12,600 m2) NDC located in the Midlands of the UK. This has enabled store staff to\nreplenish items directly to the shelf in accordance with actual sales and therefore reduced the\ntime spent by staff in the stores. It has also freed up back-of-store stockrooms as selling\nspace, where appropriate. By reducing lead times and simplifying the store replenishment\nprocess, on-shelf availability has also been increased.\nProviding this \u201cstore friendly\u201d capability has involved changes to many aspects of the\nfulfilment operation. In terms of infrastructure, a high level conveyor has been installed\nbetween two nearby warehouses so that the daily despatches can be integrated. The processes\nhave changed substantially so that item picking can be undertaken. At present, goods are\nstored on pallets and unloaded at the time of replenishing the pick face into totes or cartons\nready for item picking. In future, it is planned to receive goods in totes directly from\nsuppliers. The UODs (units of despatch) have been changed so as to provide two sizes of\ncrates for effective transport utilisation. These changes have involved substantial equipment\ninvestment in terms of conveyors, stacker lifts and flow racks. The changes affecting the staff\ninvolved flexibility of working between warehouses, multi-skilling and 6-day working.\n14\n4.6 Global drinks company\nThe company is a manufacturer of a wide range of alcoholic drinks, with many\nglobal brands. This research covered two product groups distributed via the company\u2019s\n238,000 sq ft (22,100 m2) NDC to both on-trade customers (e.g. brewers and pub groups) and\noff-trade customers (e.g. national retailers and convenience stores) in the UK.\nA key distribution challenge for the company is the handling of the seasonal peak at the\nend of the year, when about 60% of the annual volume is despatched within a three-month\nperiod. This challenge has been compounded by rapid year-on-year growth, as well as the\nnarrowing of the peak season, as retailers have sought to reduce their own seasonal\nstockholdings.\nThe company achieves this high degree of flexibility in the peak season chiefly at the\ndistribution network and distribution centre levels. Particular responses at the network level\ninclude sending goods directly from the distilleries to the customers (as the larger volumes\nmake this cost effective and as this relieves pressure on the NDC), renting additional\nwarehouse space, and making stand trailers available for pre-loading. At the distribution\ncentre level, temporary staff are engaged, many of whom work each season on a regular basis\nand are thus familiar with the operation.\n4.7 Major academic publisher\nThe case study focussed on the 118,000 sq ft (11,000 m2) distribution centre located in\nthe UK serving Europe, Middle East, Africa and Japan. The site acts as a distribution centre\nfor the company\u2019s own printed material, as well as a substantial proportion of third party\ndistribution work for other publishers. The chief issues for the distribution centre have been\n15\nthe need to accommodate growth (of about 10% throughput per annum) and handling a\nreduction in order sizes (e.g. individual books rather than case quantities).\nThe growth has been accommodated at the business unit level, by increasing the\nfrequency of delivery (i.e. smaller print runs), and, at the distribution network level, by\nwarehouse expansion and the leasing of further storage for bulk stock. At the distribution\ncentre level, space has been freed up by introducing a range of bulk storage locations, so that\npallets may move from full pallet locations to half pallet to carton locations, as the pallets are\ndiminished for replenishment. In addition, the increase in titles has been accommodated by\nreducing the sizes of the pick locations (which has a trade-off with increased replenishment\nfrequency). Information technology, together with improved supplier relationships, has been\nused to facilitate the increased throughput (e.g. electronic pre-advice and bar code labelling).\nThe variation in unit size has been handled by having distinct processes in place for\npallet, carton, multi-unit and single unit orders. For example, the multi-line orders are batch\npicked to a second \u201cactive pick face\u201d which contains books just required for that day\u2019s orders.\nThe locations are thus used for different SKUs and different quantities of SKUs each day. A\nsurplus of locations is provided to accommodate the variations in unit size requirements that\noccur on a daily basis. Flexibility has been built in to the bar code tracking system so that\ngoods can be tracked through the distribution centre at the pallet, case or unit level, depending\non the process stream in question.\n16\n5. Results\n5.1 Agility requirements\nFor the interviews with supply chain management, the three basic categories identified by\nvan Hoek (2001) formed a meaningful basis for discussing the agility requirements. During\nthese interviews, two additional categories were identified, namely the presentation of the\ngoods (e.g. as display pallets) and the flexible handling of returns. For the aid of clarity\nduring the discussions, it was found useful to separate out information as a distinct category,\nand to group all requirements related to supplier issues together. This need to react to changes\nin circumstances relating to suppliers, as well as customers, is also recognised by Stock et al.,\n(1999). A total of seven main categories were therefore used during the interviews, namely:\nvolume, time, quantity, information, presentation, inbound issues and returns. Sub-categories\n(e.g. seasonality and product life-cycles, as part of the volume variance category) were as\nnoted by van Hoek (2001), together with certain additional sub-categories identified during\nthe interviews. The results are shown in Table 2.\n[Insert Table 2 about here]\nThe results indicate that the greatest requirement for agility in the business units\ninterviewed was in terms of responding to variances in volume (i.e. throughput). Growth and\nseasonality were the two greatest challenges for these companies, although demand variance,\npromotions and product life cycles were also rated highly. Rush orders and variations in\nquantity requirements (e.g. items rather than cases) were important for a number of the\nbusiness units. Of the inbound issues, unexpected variations in delivery volumes and\/or times\n17\n(which were often interrelated) were fairly common challenges, whilst a number of business\nunits also noted flexibility issues with regard to returns.\nHaving identified the types of agility that were perceived as being important for each\nbusiness unit, the research then focussed on how the supply chain managers and distribution\ncentre managers actually responded to these requirements. The results for some of the most\ncommon variances are described below.\n5.2 Volume variance: growth\nThe methods used to accommodate rapid growth centred on distribution network\ncompetencies. Both in-house and 3PL solutions were identified. The latter included long-\nterm partnering with 3PL providers who could provide increasing space in shared user\nwarehouses, in the case of smaller operations, and ad-hoc partnering with 3PL providers who\ncould provide ready access to warehouse space, management and staff, in the case of larger\noperations. However, competencies at different levels were required covering, for example,\ninternal integration (smaller manufacturing runs) and distribution centre design (incorporating\nextra goods in\/out docks for future flexibility). The aggregated findings are shown in Table 3.\n[Insert Table 3 about here]\nNone of the companies were experiencing a fall in volumes, but this would indeed need\nto be part of the ability to respond to volume variance.\n18\n5.3 Volume variance: seasonality\nSeasonality was considered to be one of the key areas where agility was needed, with the\nnine business units having an average seasonal peak of about 100% above average levels. For\none business unit, this seasonal peak represented an increase of 300%. The range of methods\nby which the distribution centres responded to these peaks is set out in Table 4.\n[Insert Table 4 about here]\nThe most common methods of responding to seasonal variations were centred on staffing,\nparticularly the use of temporary staff, frequently coupled with the introduction of extra\nshifts. As well as the extra workload content in the peak season, especially for order picking,\nthere was also pressure on space and renting external warehouses was sometimes used to\naccommodate this. In addition, a variety of methods were used to adjust the flow of goods\neither to mitigate the effects on fixed assets or to take advantage of the extra volumes. These\nincluded the sequencing of inbound flows in smaller quantities from suppliers and the use of\ndirect deliveries to customers (by-passing the distribution centres). The latter method has the\ndual advantage of taking advantage of the greater volumes during peak to select a more cost\neffective routing, whilst at the same time relieving pressure on the distribution centre during\nthis heavy workload period.\n5.4 Volume variance: promotions\nSupplier liaison and cross-functional planning for promotions were only formalised in a\ncouple of the business units and although there were informal processes in the others this\n19\ncaused some issues for handling the variations in volumes that occurred. The activities were\neither outsourced (e.g. for assembling special packs) or the extra volumes were handled by\nadditional staffing (e.g. overtime and weekends). At one site, such measures as the allocation\nof large picking locations for promotional items and a change in the picking \/ loading process\nwere adopted.\n[Insert Table 5 about here]\n5.5 Volume variance: demand fluctuations\nIn terms of demand variance, the responses were focussed on developing competencies at\nthe distribution centre level in order to be able to react whenever they occurred. Most\ncentered around staffing, although there were some solutions in other categories, such as the\ndirect shipment of large orders to customers, by-passing the distribution centre, and the use of\nadditional pick slots that could be allocated to those items in heavy demand. The responses\nare shown in Table 6.\n[Insert Table 6 about here]\nThe responses relating to the external integration with customers related more to how\nnon-agility was addressed i.e. smoothing flows within the order cycle time (which does not\naffect customer service within the specified lead times) or rationing deliveries to customers in\nsome way (which does affect service levels).\n20\n5.6 Time variance\nFor time variance (e.g. rush orders), the responses were focussed on process and systems\nsolutions at the distribution centre level. Generally, these orders were accommodated by\nprioritising them, for example, by the use of real-time warehouse management systems and\nradio data terminals.\n5.7 Quantity variance\nWith regard to quantity variance (e.g. being able to respond to orders for items, cases and\npallets), a number of the business units had identifiable processes and workstreams in place\nfor each type of order. Where significant variations were taking place (as in changing from\ncase to item replenishment for stores), this involved competencies at all levels to be able to\nimplement the change. For more minor variances, then the competencies were chiefly at\ndistribution centre level, particularly in terms of processes. The responses are summarised in\nTable 7.\n[Insert Table 7 about here]\n5.8 Inbound variance: volume \/ time\nOn the inbound side, the distribution centres needed to be agile to respond to variances\nfrom suppliers whilst minimising the impact on customer service levels. The responses fell\ninto two categories. The first was the resolution of the problem, which was naturally at\nsupply chain level, by co-ordination with the suppliers. The second was at distribution centre\n21\nlevel in being able to handle these variances if ever they occurred. For example, one business\nunit had a process to cross-dock back orders automatically, in order to expedite the goods for\nall outstanding customer orders.\n6. Summary\nA summary of the responses for the main categories of agility identified during the study\nis set out in Table 8.\n[Insert Table 8 about here]\nThese results indicate that the business units used competencies at a combination of\nlevels, particularly where there was prior knowledge that some degree of variance was likely\nto occur, for example in terms of promotions and seasonality. Growth was largely handled\ninternally, with large scale-growth being enabled at the business unit and distribution network\nlevel, although moderate growth could be addressed at the distribution centre level. Similarly,\nquantity variance involved multi-levels where it affected the whole supply chain, but was\nhandled at the distribution centre level otherwise. Rush orders from customers and late \/\nincomplete receipts from suppliers were accommodated at the distribution centre level,\nalthough, in the case of the latter, resolution of the issue obviously occurred in co-ordination\nwith the suppliers.\nThe detailed breakdown of the distribution centre level responses is set out in Table 9.\nThis shows the combinations of competencies used at that level to respond to different types\nof variance. For example, growth was largely tackled by equipment design, time variance by\n22\nprocess \/ systems solutions, whilst seasonal and demand variances were handled chiefly by\nstaffing policies.\n[Insert Table 9 about here]\nIn the workshop discussion, it was agreed that agility could best be handled where\nvariances are tackled at all four levels. The supply chain and business unit levels are\nimportant for planning, smoothing throughputs, resolving issues and restructuring the supply\nnetwork, whilst the distribution network and distribution centre levels need to be designed to\nhandle the true variances that remain. Practical difficulties were acknowledged that needed to\nbe overcome to achieve the type of integration needed. Particular examples cited include:\n\uf0b7 The commercial sensitivity of promotions and thus the lack of prior knowledge even\nwithin the organisation.\n\uf0b7 The precision of marketing information (e.g. forthcoming promotional activity at\nSKU, rather than generic product line, level).\n\uf0b7 The writing-off and disposal of old inventory to make way for new product lines.\n\uf0b7 The alignment of performance metrics and incentives to business goals (e.g. the use of\nunit cost manufacturing metrics).\n\uf0b7 The organisational structure and responsibilities (e.g. the role of supply chain\nmanagement, as well as the particular role of distribution centre management in\ndecision making).\nA pre-requisite to the capability to respond to volatile markets is thus the organisational\nand information-sharing competencies that form the basis of much of the supply chain\n23\nmanagement concept. These need to be present at the levels of external, internal and\nfunctional integration as noted by Stevens (1989). The framework developed in this paper\ncan then be used as a basis for developing the capabilities to respond to the different types of\nagility that are required by the market.\n7. Conclusions\nCreating a customer focussed, responsive capability requires an organisation-wide\norientation towards customer retention, supported by an appropriate structure and information\nsystems (Day, 2003). The importance of such a demand-side orientation in supply chain\nstrategy, and its link to agility, is supported by research undertaken by Morash (2001).\nHowever, it should be recognised that this orientation will only offer sustained competitive\nadvantage if it is a dynamic capability capable of renewing competencies so as to achieve\ncontinual alignment with the changing business environment (Teece et al., 1997).\nThe framework outlined above offers a tool for companies to review their responsiveness\nto the market from the viewpoint of the actual operation at distribution centre level. It does\nhowever need to be reviewed constantly to ensure that the competencies are in place to\nrespond to the types of agility that are likely to be faced. There appears not to be a \u201cone size\nfits all\u201d solution for all agility types. Different combinations of competencies are needed to\naddress each type of agility, and this supports Zhang et al., (2002). However, many of the\ncompetencies are common across a number of agility types. For example, flexible staffing\narrangements were used to provide agile responses to seasonality, promotions, product life\ncycle changes, demand variances, as well as to inbound variances. Some of the main\ncompetencies identified by the case studies were the ability to:\n24\n\uf0b7 optimise the supply chain in conjunction with suppliers and customers;\n\uf0b7 plan and make trade-off decisions across company functions;\n\uf0b7 flex the space used within shared-user 3PL warehouses (for smaller operations);\n\uf0b7 access additional rented warehousing space quickly;\n\uf0b7 plan and have new warehouses operational rapidly (either own warehouses or through\na 3PL);\n\uf0b7 route flows through the network in line with changing circumstances;\n\uf0b7 design buildings and equipment for growth and flexibility;\n\uf0b7 adopt flexible staffing arrangements (for own and temporary staff);\n\uf0b7 put processes in place to address potential variances;\n\uf0b7 support these processes with appropriate information systems.\nThese competencies occur at all levels from external integration (e.g. with suppliers and\ncustomers) through to the distribution centre level and this supports the view by Mason-Jones\nand Towill (1999, p 62) that systems thinking is \u201cthe ideal way to approach the problem of\ndesigning agile supply chains\u201d.\nThe framework is intended to provide a useful tool to practitioners for assessing the types\nof agile capabilities required and the competencies that need to be put in place to respond to\nthese eventualities. It can act as an initial check-list to ensure that potential competencies at\neach level have been considered. The relative implication of each option in terms of range,\nmobility, uniformity and cost (Upton, 1994) can then be assessed by practitioners. For\nexample, some companies are addressing agility in terms of cost adaptability, by reducing\nfixed costs (Katayama and Bennett, 1999), and this framework presents a first step for\nidentifying the possible options to be examined. Such implications provide an area for further\nresearch into this subject.\n25\nThis case study research has been based on nine business units and has concentrated on\noutward distribution in the fast-moving consumer goods sector. Its applicability to other parts\nof the supply chain and to other sectors thus needs to be validated, as well as a more detailed\nexploration of potential competencies at each level. In particular, further research is required\nto identify the common competencies that are required to enable responsiveness across a\nnumber of agility types and thus for distribution centres to be agile in the true sense of the\nword.\nIn the case studies researched, most of the distribution centres were dedicated to the\nparticular companies involved, especially for the larger operations. These distribution centres\nrepresent expensive fixed assets (however they are financed or operated) and are pivotal to the\nprovision of high customer service levels. As noted by Frazelle (2002b), distribution centres\nare critical to the success or failure of many companies. It is thus imperative that distribution\ncentres are fully integrated into the planning and operations of companies\u2019 supply chains, and\nthat they are designed and operated in order to be able to meet the responsiveness to the\nmarket that may be required, in spite of the fixed asset nature of major distribution operations.\nIn fact, this fixed asset nature can make distribution infrastructures difficult to imitate by\ncompetitors and thus provide a source of competitive advantage for a company (as per\nBarney, 1991). This is a major challenge for practitioners in the field.\n26\nReferences\nAbrahamsson, M., N. Aldin and F.
