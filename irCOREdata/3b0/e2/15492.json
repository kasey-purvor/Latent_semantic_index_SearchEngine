The statistically much \nrarer threats to children\u201fs safety which make headlines in the West, most notably \nabduction and murder by strangers, tend to overshadow a malaise of more common \nrisks such as abuse and neglect within the family, educational underachievement, the \ndetention of young asylum seekers, poverty and social exclusion.  \n \nCritical social science perspectives which interrogate these \u201eat risk\u201f conceptualisations \nof children and childhood are expanding (e.g. Anderson et al, 1994; Panter-Brick and \nSmith, 2000; Roberts et al, 1995; Scott et al, 1998). Geographers have made \nimportant contributions to these debates, highlighting some of the spatialities of risk \nfor children (e.g. Aitken, 2001; Tucker and Matthews, 2001; Valentine, 1996; \n 2 \nValentine and Holloway, 2001). The papers here all contribute to these spatial \nperspectives. Sarah Maguire and Pete Shirlow examine perceptions of children\u201fs \nsafety in rural Northern Ireland. Catherine Panter-Brick reviews the evidence on \nhealth risks for children living on the streets around the world. My paper with Peter \nFrancis reports on locations of victimization, offending and fear for homeless young \npeople in a British city. Each paper examines discourses and empirical evidence about \nchildren supposedly \u201eat risk\u201f in different contexts. Some important questions are \nraised about the nature of risk in childhood, and the contradiction between the \ncommon labelling of children and their everyday experiences of risk. Each also points \nto the spatialities of risk, and the relevance of these to the responses of individuals, \nthe state or voluntary agencies.   \n \nLike childhood itself, the categorization \u201eat risk\u201f is constructed and experienced very \ndifferently in different places. And in many cases, constructions of childhood inform \nassumptions about risk and vice versa. For Panter-Brick, \u201estreet children\u201f have been \ndefined by physical location (the street) and their lack of strong ties to the private \nsphere. Because they are not living in a home setting, they receive much public \nattention which centres on an assumption of risk. Panter-Brick argues that the \ncategory \u201ehomelessness\u201f, and street children\u201fs categorisation as \u201eat risk\u201f, are both \nunhelpful, as they obscure poverty, the real enemy to children\u201fs health and welfare. In \nMaguire and Shirlow\u201fs study, rural Northern Ireland provides a contradictory setting \nfor parents\u201f fear of crime, as on the one hand, it is seen as a quiet, safe and more \nprotective environment for children than urban areas or mainland Britain, but on the \nother it has been the recent setting for ethnosectarian violence. Children here, like \nchildren everywhere, receive contradictory messages about safety, but these are \n 3 \nrooted in the specific nature of local social space. Pain and Francis show how children \nwho are \u201eout of place\u201f in British society, particularly \u201eexcluded\u201f groups of older boys, \nquickly become viewed as a risk to others, whatever their own histories or current \nexperiences of victimization. The parallel presumption that younger children and \nyoung women are more at risk themselves once homeless is based on misguided ideas \nabout home as safe. Most of the experiences of violence reported involved those with \na duty of protection towards children, especially family members and the police.  \n  \nDiscourses of \u201echildren at risk\u201f are always spatialized, then, and especially important \nfor these authors are constructions of home. Common images of street children, and \ninterventions to help them, may have negative implications for their health and safety \nonce children are removed from the streets. For Panter-Brick, wide assumptions about \nwhere children are \u201eat risk\u201f ignore the contextualisation of risk in local places. She \nargues that \u201eat risk\u201f is a global discourse which sets global characteristics for street \nchildren. While there is a tendency to compare the health and welfare of children in \ndeveloping countries with \u201eWestern middle class children, the \u201cgold standard\u201d of \nchildhood\u201f, street children are actually healthier then other groups of poor local \nchildren. Stranger danger is another prevalent spatial discourse, where fear of child \nabuse, like sexual violence, is spatialized and distanced from the family and the \nfamiliar. In Maguire and Shirlow\u201fs work, strangers were often equated with those \nfrom opposite ethnosectarian groups \u2013 as Ahmed (2000) has argued, the stranger is in \nfact known and recognisable before any encounter, and children learn to read places \nand people in this particular light. Many mothers\u201f fears focused on their children\u201fs \nsafety outdoors, and yet several gave accounts of child abuse from well known and \nrespected men in the community. Most were vague in their warnings to children; in \n 4 \nclose-knit communities with strong Christian values, protecting the integrity of the \nfamily seems to have priority over child protection.  \n \nAll such global discourses \u2013 whether worldwide, or singular discourses applied closer \nto home - obscure important differences between children at lesser scales. Within \ncountries, cities, neighbourhoods and homes, there are deep social divides \ndetermining dangerous environments and which children are most at risk. Class, \nnationality, ethnicity, gender and age are all fundamental in structuring these risks, as \neach paper draws out, and children are often multiply positioned. Pain and Francis \nargue that this challenges the \u201eeither\/or\u201f distinction which often structures \nunderstanding of offenders and victims, feared and fearful, and safe and dangerous \nspaces. For the homeless young people in our study, there were often no clear \ndistinctions between being \u201ea risk\u201f and being \u201eat risk\u201f - victims are at times offenders, \nand the \u201efeared\u201f in this case may be more fearful still. Highlighting children\u201fs \nresilience and ability to survive living on the streets and move on, on the other hand, \nhas been central to Panter-Brick\u201fs work. While the state, voluntary agencies and much \nacademic research has tended to construct the homeless purely as victims, the young \npeople in Pain and Francis\u201f study resisted the categorization of \u201evictim\u201f, and as \nprevious work (e.g. Ruddick 1996) has shown, space is often used in these struggles \nagainst labelling with certain identities. Risk itself may be viewed quite differently by \nchildren and outside agencies, sometimes as exciting and positively sought out.  \n \nAll of these alternative perspectives on children at risk were accessed through more \nsensitive qualitative and participatory methodologies with children and young people. \nAs the papers show, placing children as experts is also important in questioning levels \n 5 \nof risk to which they are exposed. Many risks are hidden, certainly from official \nstatistics, academics and parents. Policy attention is often therefore inadequate; for \nexample services for victims of crime tend to be orientated to adults\u201f needs and \npatterns of adult victimization. This short collection signals, then, not only a need to \nmove beyond \u201eat risk\u201f categorizations of children, and to explore further the \nimportance of space, place and difference in this analysis, but to find ways to look \nfurther than representations and discourses of risk and highlight the material problems \nwhich are important to children themselves.  \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAHMED, S.
