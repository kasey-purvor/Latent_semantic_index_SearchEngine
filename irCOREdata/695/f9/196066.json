Introduction \nIn a certain class of repeated dyadic games, pairs of players can learn to cooperate without \nany deliberate intention to do so and, more remarkably still, without awareness of their strategic \ninterdependence or even of each other\u2019s existence. Sidowski discovered this phenomenon during \nhis doctoral research into the effects of reward and punishment in games (Sidowski, 1957; \nSidowski, Wyckoff, & Tabory, 1956). Since then, a small number of researchers have continued \nto study adaptive learning under conditions of profound ignorance that Sidowski et al. named the \nminimal social situation or MSS. A slender thread of MSS research has stretched from the 1950s \ninto the second millennium (Colman, 2005; Delepoulle, Preux, & Darcheville, 2000, 2001; \nMitropoulos, 2001, 2003). \n \n  II \n  C D \nI \nC +, + \u2013, + \nD +, \u2013 \u2013, \u2013 \n  \nFig. 1. Mutual Fate Control game. \n \nThe type of game most commonly used to study the MSS, named Mutual Fate Control by \nThibaut and Kelley (1959, chapter 7), has the payoff matrix displayed in Fig. 1. According to \nstandard game-theoretic notation, Player I chooses a row labeled C (cooperate) or D (defect), \nPlayer II independently chooses a column C or D, and the pair of symbols in each cell are the \npayoffs to Player I and Player II in that order for the corresponding outcome of the game. It is \nunnecessary at this stage to assign numerical utilities to the payoffs; we assume merely that \nevery possible outcome yields either a positive (+) or a negative (\u2013) payoff to each player. \nMinimal Social Situations  2  \n \n \nIf both players simultaneously choose the cooperative strategy C, then the outcome is shown \nin the upper-left cell, where it is evident that both players are rewarded with positive payoffs. If \nboth simultaneously choose D, then both suffer negative payoffs. If one chooses C while the \nother chooses D, then the player who cooperates receives a negative payoff and the one who \ndefects receives a positive payoff. In the MSS, the game is played under severely restricted \ninformation insofar as both players know their own strategy set {C, D} but are ignorant of the \nco-player\u2019s strategy set and of both players\u2019 payoff functions\u2014the payoffs that result from every \npossible pair of strategy choices, represented by the pairs of symbols in the cells of the payoff \nmatrix. A distinction needs to be made between the strict MSS, in which both players know that \nthey are involved in a decision-making task but are oblivious of the fact that they are playing a \ngame, and consequently that their payoffs are affected by the decisions of another player, and the \ninformed MSS, in which they know that they are playing an interactive game, although they do \nnot know the payoff functions. In experimental MSS research, the game is usually repeated \n(iterated) many times to allow adaptive learning to occur. \n \n  II   II   II \n  \nC D \n  \nC D \n  \nC D \nI C 3, 3 0, 5 \n \nC 2, 2 0, 3  C 1, 1 0, 1 \nD 5, 0 1, 1  D 3, 0 1, 1  D 1, 0 0, 0 \n  (a)   (b)   (c) \n  \nFig. 2. The Mutual Fate Control game as a degenerate Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game. (a) Standard Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma \ngame. (b) Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game with ordinal-scale payoffs. (c) Mutual Fate Control game corresponding to \nPrisoner\u2019s Dilemma game with binary-scale payoffs. \n \nThe Mutual Fate Control game can be interpreted as a degenerate Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game, \nwith the level of measurement in the payoff functions reduced from an interval to a binary scale \n(Soza\u0144ski, 1992). This is immediately obvious from inspection of Fig. 2. Panel (a) shows a \nstandard Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game. In (b), the original payoffs are replaced by ordinal numbers \n0, 1, 2, and 3, with 0 replacing the smallest number, 1 replacing the second-smallest, and so on. \nIn (c), the two smallest numbers are replaced by 0 and the two largest numbers by 1. The change \nin measurement scale makes a big difference: the strategic properties of the Mutual Fate Control \ngame differ from those of the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game in the following ways. \nThe Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game (Fig. 2a) has a unique Nash equilibrium at (D, D), \nrepresenting joint defection. A Nash equilibrium is an outcome in which each player\u2019s strategy is \na best reply to that of the co-player, inasmuch as it yields the highest available payoff to the \nplayer choosing it, given the co-player\u2019s chosen strategy. Against a co-player who chooses D, the \nD strategy yields the highest payoff (it yields 1, whereas a C choice yields 0), hence at (D, D) the \nplayers\u2019 strategies are in Nash equilibrium, and this property is lacking at each of the other three \npossible outcomes of the game. Furthermore, the D strategies are strictly dominant for both \nplayers, inasmuch as D yields a strictly higher payoff than C, irrespective of the strategy chosen \nby the co-player\u2014a payoff of 5 rather than 3 if the co-player chooses C, and of 1 rather than 0 if \nthe co-player chooses D. It follows that D is the unconditionally best, uniquely rational strategy \nMinimal Social Situations  3  \n \n \nin the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game. In the Mutual Fate Control game (Fig. 2c), on the other hand, \nall four outcomes (C, C), (C, D), (D, C), (D, D) are weak Nash equilibria, each player\u2019s strategy \nyielding a payoff no better but no worse than any other, given the co-player\u2019s strategy, and \nneither strategy is strictly dominant. The defining property of the Mutual Fate Control game, as \nits name implies, is that each player\u2019s payoff is determined exclusively by the co-player\u2019s \nchoice\u2014a strategy choice has no effect on the payoff of the player choosing it. This property is \nnot shared by the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game, in which payoffs are determined jointly by the \nchoices of both players, as is normally the case in strategic games. \nThis analysis relies on key concepts of game theory that originated from assumptions about \nhuman rationality. However, when games are repeated many times, primitive adaptive processes \ncan mimic rational choice, and the key game-theoretic concepts turn out to have relevance even \nif the players are unaware that they are playing a game. This was first pointed out by Nash \n(1950): \u2015It is unnecessary to assume that the participants have full knowledge of the total \nstructure of the game, or the ability and inclination to go through any complex reasoning \nprocess\u2016 (p. 21). Young (1998) later explained: \u2015Evolutionary forces often substitute for high \n(and implausible) rationality when the adaptive process has enough time to unfold\u2016 (p. 5, italics \nin original). \nMutual Fate Control can occur naturally in everyday strategic interactions. Kelley and \nThibaut (1978, pp. 5\u201313) discussed at some length an example taken from Tolstoy\u2019s novella, \nFamily Happiness, and Colman (1995, pp. 40\u201350) discussed a lifelike example of a strict MSS \ninvolving data analysts logging in to a central computer from different locations and potentially \ndisrupting each other\u2019s work. Here is a more homely example. Every morning, Alf chooses \nwhether to give his son raisins or cheese sticks to snack on during the day. Similarly, Beth \nchooses between popcorn or peanuts for her daughter\u2019s snack. The children are friends and \nalways share their snacks with each other at school, although their parents know nothing about \nthis. Alf\u2019s son is allergic to peanuts and gets ill if he eats any of his friend\u2019s peanuts, and Beth\u2019s \ndaughter is allergic to cheese and gets ill if she eats any of her friend\u2019s cheese sticks. The upshot \nis that although each parent\u2019s snack choice has no effect whatsoever on his or her own child\u2019s \nwellbeing, in each case one option leaves the other parent\u2019s child well and its parent happy, \nwhereas the alternative option makes the other child ill and upsets its parent. The choices of Alf \nand Beth govern each other\u2019s fates, and if we consider each day as a single round of the game, \nthen this is evidently a strict MSS, repeated daily. \nAlthough games played without knowledge of the relevant payoff functions are common in \neveryday life, it may seem unlikely that players could learn to cooperate in any repeated game in \nwhich they were ignorant not only of the nature but also of the fact of their interdependence. \nHowever, experimental evidence suggests that adaptive learning, resulting in increasing \ncooperation, can occur even in the strict MSS, through a process that Kelley (1968) called \ninterpersonal accommodation, without any conscious intention to cooperate or awareness of the \nopportunity for cooperation. \nThe earliest MSS experiments (Sidowski, 1957; Sidowski et al., 1956) used a methodology \nand incentive scheme that would be difficult to navigate through a present-day research ethics \ncommittee or institutional review board. Pairs of players were seated in separate rooms, unaware \nof each other\u2019s existence, and electrodes capable of delivering painful shocks were attached to \ntheir non-preferred hands. Each player was provided with a pair of buttons for choosing \nstrategies and a digital display showing the cumulative number of points scored. The game was \nrepeated over many rounds, with both players pursuing the goal of maximizing rewards (points) \nMinimal Social Situations  4  \n \n \nand minimizing punishments (shocks). Rewards and punishments were arranged according to the \nMutual Fate Control payoff matrix shown in Fig. 1, but the players were not shown the matrix \nand were ignorant of the dyadic linkage and general setup of the experiment. For half the players, \npressing the left-hand button (labeled C in Fig. 1) caused the co-player to be rewarded with \npoints, and pressing the right-hand button (D) caused the co-player to be punished with an \nelectric shock, and for the rest of the players, the functions of the left and right-hand buttons \nwere reversed. \nSidowski (1957) ran some of his participants in an informed MSS treatment condition in \nwhich they were told that \u2015there is another S in another room who controls the number of shocks \nand the number of scores that you will receive. You in turn control the number of shocks and \nscores which the other S receives\u2016 (p. 320). In this condition, although the participants were not \ninformed about the precise nature of their interdependence (the payoff functions), they knew that \nthey were making interactive decisions. Interestingly, this additional information produced no \nincrease in the relative frequency of cooperative choices (p. 324), although in a later experiment \n(Kelley et al., 1962), it did produce a small increase. \nImmediately following Sidowski\u2019s earliest experiments, researchers dispensed with electric \nshocks. Most subsequent experiments involved incentive schemes based merely on positive and \nnegative points, and the participants were instructed to try to maximize their cumulative (net) \npoint totals (e.g., Crawford & Sidowski, 1964; Kelley et al., 1962; Rabinowitz, Kelley, & \nRosenblatt, 1966; Sidowski & Smith, 1961). The points were not converted into money or any \nother tangible rewards. As in the earlier experiments, pairs of players generally learned over \nrepeated rounds to coordinate on the efficient (C, C) outcome, even in strict MSS conditions in \nwhich they were unaware of their strategic interdependence. A typical finding was that the \nproportion of C choices reached approximately 75% after 200 rounds, with a small number of \npairs settling down at some stage to choosing C on every round. In other words, some players \nbehaved as if they were learning to cooperate, although the situation was, from their point of \nview, non-interactive, and they did not know\u2014and did not guess, as early experimenters \nconfirmed through postexperimental interviews\u2014that they were linked to co-players in \ninteractive decisions that afforded opportunities for cooperation. It seems reasonable, therefore, \nto describe this behavior as adaptive learning to cooperate without awareness of strategic \ninterdependence. This is not inconsistent with evidence that awareness of stimulus contingencies \nis a necessary condition for human conditioning to occur (Lovibond & Shanks, 2002), because a \ndecision maker can be aware of the stimulus contingencies without becoming aware of the \ninvolvement of a strategically interdependent co-player. \nFollowing these early experiments, further investigations of the MSS were published, using \nhuman and occasionally animal players, and the findings were broadly similar (Arickx & Van \nAvermaet, 1981; Bertilson & Lien, 1982; Bertilson, Wonderlich, & Blum, 1983, 1984; Boren, \n1966; Delepoulle et al., 2000, 2001; Mitropoulos, 2001, 2003; Molm, 1981). For example, in an \ninformed MSS experiment reported by Mitropoulos (2003), the relative frequency of cooperative \nchoices reached 66% after only 100 rounds. \n \n1.1. MSS Theory \nHow can adaptive learning without awareness be explained, especially in the strict MSS? The \nmost persuasive suggestion was put forward by Thibaut and Kelley (1959), who hypothesized \nthat MSS players tend to adopt a myopic win\u2013stay, lose\u2013shift (WSLS) decision rule. This is a \ndecision rule, applicable to any repeated binary decision task, according to which a decision \nMinimal Social Situations  5  \n \n \nmaker chooses arbitrarily on the first round and then repeats on every subsequent Round t any \nchoice that was followed by a positive payoff on Round t \u2013 1 and switches to the alternative \noption on Round t after receiving a negative payoff on Round t \u2013 1. Rapoport and Chammah \n(1965, pp. 73\u201374) rediscovered WSLS in a study of the repeated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game and \nrather unkindly called it Simpleton. The mathematicians Kraines and Kraines (1989) \nrediscovered it yet again in their research into evolutionary games and called it Pavlov because \nof its reflex-like character, and this term has persisted in the burgeoning literature of \nevolutionary games. To a psychologist, WSLS is essentially a formalization of Thorndike\u2019s \n(1898, 1911, 1927) law of effect: \n \nOf several responses made to the same situation, those which are accompanied or closely followed by \nsatisfaction to the animal will, other things being equal, be more firmly connected with the situation, so that, \nwhen it recurs, they will be more likely to recur; those which are accompanied or closely followed by \ndiscomfort to the animal will, other things being equal, have their connections with that situation weakened, so \nthat, when it recurs, they will be less likely to occur. The greater the satisfaction or discomfort, the greater the \nstrengthening or weakening of the bond. (Thorndike, 1911, p. 244) \n \nThis is a fundamental behavioral law (Bonem & Crossman, 1988; Dennett, 1975; Ferster & \nSkinner, 1957; Skinner, 1969; Teigen, 2002), in spite of certain controversies that have attended \nit (Bitterman & Schoel, 1970; Herrnstein, 1970), and learning processes approximating it occur \npervasively in nature (Bitterman, 1975; Nowak & Sigmund, 1993). \nCamerer (2003, chap. 6) reviewed a wide range of approaches to learning in games, \nincluding reinforcement learning, belief-learning models, experience-weighted attraction (EWA) \nmodels, anticipatory learning and sophistication, imitation learning, learning direction theory, \nand rule learning theories. Apart from reinforcement learning, these approaches are inapplicable \nto the MSS because of the impoverished information that is available to MSS players. Simple \nreinforcement learning theories (e.g., Barron & Erev, 2003; Erev & Roth, 1998; Feltovich, 2000; \nRoth & Erev, 1995), on the other hand, are closely related to WSLS, and the most relevant forms \nof reinforcement learning will be revisited in Section 6.4. \nWe formalize the WSLS theory as follows. We represent the outcomes of successive rounds \nof the MSS by a sequence of ordered pairs, the elements of each pair corresponding to the \nstrategy choices of Players I and II respectively. We assume that the game is repeated an \nindefinite number of times, that the players\u2019 initial choices are arbitrary, and that on all \nsubsequent rounds they implement WSLS deterministically. \nWhat happens if the initial, arbitrary choices of both players are C (cooperate)? Each player \nrewards the co-player, and because both payoffs are positive, neither player ever switches to the \nalternative strategy: \n \n(C, C)  (C, C)  (C, C)  . . . \n \nWhat happens if both players initially choose D (defect)? In this case, both receive negative \npayoffs on the first round, causing them to shift to C on the second round, after which (as shown \nabove) they repeat these C choices on all subsequent rounds: \n \n(D, D)  (C, C)  (C, C)  . . . \n \nMinimal Social Situations  6  \n \n \nLast, what happens if one player initially chooses C and the other D? In that case, the C-\nchooser receives a negative payoff on the first round and therefore shifts to D on the second \nround, and the D-chooser receives a positive payoff on the first round and therefore stays with D. \nOn the second round, both players accordingly choose D, followed (as shown above) by C on all \nsubsequent rounds: \n \n(C, D)  (D, D)  (C, C)  (C, C)  . . . \n(D, C)  (D, D)  (C, C)  (C, C)  . . . \n \nIt is clear from this analysis that players who use WSLS learn to cooperate\u2014to choose \nmutually rewarding strategies\u2014by the third round at the latest, and continue cooperating \nindefinitely after that. However, this is not what actually happens in MSS experiments, in which \njoint cooperation develops only very slowly over many repetitions and never attains 100%, with \nall pairs choosing C on every round. This implies that players do not adhere strictly to WSLS or \nthe law of effect. For example, in informed MSS experiments, Mitropoulos (2001, 2003) found \nlittle direct evidence for strict WSLS and considerable inertia in choice behavior, even in a \ntreatment condition in which the players were told that the payoff scheme was such that each \nplayer\u2019s choice completely determined the payoff of the co-player (Mitropoulos, 2003, p. 29). \nNevertheless, there are at least three reasons for assuming that players probably use a \nnondeterministic, noisy WSLS-like rule in the MSS. First, the slow adaptive learning that has \nbeen observed by many independent experimenters is difficult to explain without assuming that \ndecision makers use some such decision rule, especially under strict MSS information \nconditions, because it is hard to imagine how else they could solve the problem at the behavioral \nlevel, as many of them do, at least to a degree. Second, empirical evidence has been found for \nreinforcement learning in an almost unlimited range of learning environments, and there is no \nobvious reason to suppose that the MSS is an exception. Third, Edgeworth\u2019s (1881) famous \ndictum, \u2015The first principle of Economics is that every agent is actuated only by self-interest\u2016 (p. \n16), is equally applicable to the MSS as to any other decision task and, in the MSS, it seems to \nmandate WSLS or some functionally equivalent decision rule, because it is the natural way for \ndecision makers to realize their aspirations (Posch, Pichler, & Sigmund, 1999). \n \n1.2. Multiplayer MSS Theory \nThe multiplayer minimal social situation is a formal generalization of the MSS to an arbitrary \nnumber of players, modeled as a Galois field of integers modulo 2 (Coleman, Colman, & \nThomas, 1990). The set of n \u2265 2 players, each with a uniquely designated predecessor and \nsuccessor, is represented by a cyclic graph of valency 2. The easiest way to visualize this \nstructure is to imagine n players, labeled 1, 2, ..., n, seated round a table, making decisions \nsequentially, in anticlockwise order. Each player is then flanked by a predecessor on her left and \na successor on her right. Player l\u2019s predecessor is Player n and Player n\u2019s successor is Player 1. \nEach player has a choice of two strategies, C and D, hence the choices of the n players on each \nround can be represented by an n-vector of Cs and Ds called a configuration. Whenever a player \nchooses C, that player\u2019s successor receives a positive payoff, and whenever a player chooses D, \nthat player\u2019s successor receives a negative payoff. \nAccording to WSLS, any player who receives a rewarding payoff will repeat the same \nstrategy on the following round, and one who receives an unrewarding payoff will shift strategies \non the following round. Under WSLS, every configuration is therefore followed by a uniquely \nMinimal Social Situations  7  \n \n \nspecified configuration on the following round. It is obvious that a jointly cooperative \nconfiguration consisting exclusively of C choices will be repeated on all subsequent rounds. The \ntwo-player MSS is a special (dyadic) case of the multiplayer MSS, and the analysis presented \nearlier shows that all initial MSS configurations lead to joint cooperation by the third round at \nthe latest. Coleman et al. (1990) proved that this result generalizes to groups of size 2, 4, 8, 16, \nand so on\u2014groups of size 2n with n = 1, 2, 3, . . . . They also proved that in odd-sized groups, no \nadaptive learning takes place under deterministic WSLS, so that joint cooperation occurs only \nwhen all players happen to make the same arbitrary choice (all C or all D) on the first round, the \nprobability of this being (1\/2)n \u2013 1 and decreasing rapidly with the number n of players: the \nprobability is 1\/4 in a three-player group, 1\/16 in a five-player group, 1\/64 in a seven-player \ngroup, and so on. In groups that are even-sized but not powers of 2 (group sizes 6, 10, and so \non), adaptive learning occurs from some initial configurations but not others. If n is even, and if k \nis the highest power of 2 that divides n evenly, then the configurations that lead to joint \ncooperation are (x1, ..., xn) such that xi = xi\u2013k for all i (mod n). For example, in a six-player group, \nit is easy to verify that the configuration (D, C, D, C, D, C) leads quickly to joint cooperation \nunder WSLS, because it is followed by (D, D, D, D, D, D), and then by (C, C, C, C, C, C), \nrepeated indefinitely. But the six-player configuration (D, D, C, C, D, D) generates the following \nsequence: (D, D, C, C, D, D)  (C, C, D, C, D, C)  (C, C, D, D, D, D)  (D, C, D, C, C, C) \n (D, D, D, D, C, C)  (D, C, C, C, D, C)  (D, D, C, C, D, D), returning to the starting point \nafter six rounds and therefore cycling forever without ever reaching (C, C, C, C, C, C). Of the 64 \npossible configurations in a six-player MSS, just four satisfy the condition xi = xi\u2013k for all i (mod \nn), hence 1\/16 of them, or 6.25%, progress to joint cooperation. For formal proofs, see Colman \n(2005, Theorems 1\u20134). \nAlthough Kelley et al. (1962) were unaware of these admittedly nonintuitive theoretical \nproperties of the generalized MSS, they included 28 three-player and 14 four-player strict MSS \ngroups in one of their experiments. The results were C choices close to 50%\u2014no better than \nchance\u2014for both group sizes, and no significant increases over 150 rounds. Smith and Murdoch \n(1970) studied strict and informed three-player and four-player MSS games, with 16 groups in \neach combination of group size and information condition. They found no differences between \nstrict and informed groups and small increases in C choices over 150 rounds in four-player \ngroups only. Findings from the second of these studies appear broadly consistent with the \nmultiplayer MSS theory of Coleman et al. (1990), assuming that players use a noisy form of \nWSLS, although these earlier researchers lacked a theoretical basis for formulating hypotheses \nabout adaptive learning in their multiplayer groups. \nWSLS is a plausible method of making decisions in the dyadic MSS and more generally in \nthe multiplayer MSS. Given the limited information supplied to the players, especially in strict \nMSS conditions, it is difficult to imagine how the adaptive learning reported by experimenters \ncould be explained without assuming that some players, at least, used a form of WSLS with \nmisimplementation noise or something functionally equivalent to it. But WSLS theory has not \nbeen rigorously tested in the multiplayer MSS, where it yields predictions that are far from \nobvious but are nevertheless empirically testable. \n \n1.3. Rationale for Current Research \nOur experiments were designed to test some key predictions about adaptive learning in MSS \ngroups of different sizes. Our experimental methodology corrected some of the deficiencies of \nearly experiments in this area. One obvious weakness of most previous experiments is that \nMinimal Social Situations  8  \n \n \nprocedures were not fully automated. In many cases, players made their choices as and when \nthey wished, and payoffs were delivered on each round by an experimenter operating a control \nunit manually after both players had made their choices, potentially undermining the strict \ninformation conditions by providing subtle clues, especially in the timing of payoffs, that \noutcomes depended on something apart from individual participants\u2019 own choices. \nAnother weakness of most MSS experiments, including the multiplayer MSS experiments of \nKelley et al. (1962) and Smith and Murdoch (1970), was the lack of tangible incentives, raising \nquestions about the degree to which the players were motivated to maximize the valueless points \nthat were assumed to represent the relevant utilities governing their behavior. Mitropoulos (2001, \n2003) is among the very few researchers to have used financial incentives in MSS research, but \nhis MSS experiments were informed rather than strict. It is widely accepted nowadays that \nexperimental games require tangible incentives (Camerer, 2003). Without incentives, \nparticipants\u2019 behavior tends to be relatively \u2015weak, erratic, and . . . readily satiated\u2016 (Smith, \n1976, p. 277). Incentives reduce the variance in participants\u2019 behavior and generally improve \ndecision making, bringing decisions closer to predictions of rational choice theory and game \ntheory (Camerer & Hogarth, 1999; Smith & Walker, 1993), especially in tasks of intermediate \ndifficulty (Hertwig & Ortmann, 2001). \nThe experiments described below were designed to test the most fundamental predictions of \nWSLS theory, namely that adaptive learning should occur in two-player and four-player groups, \nand in a small proportion of six-player groups, but not in three-player groups. Our experiments \nwere implemented on networked computers, enabling synchronized decision making and \nrigorous control, and our participants were motivated with substantial financial incentives. \n \n2. Experiment 1: Strict MSS \nThis experiment was designed primarily to discover whether adaptive learning in different \ngroup sizes follows the pattern specified by the theoretical multiplayer MSS analysis of Coleman \net al. (1990). The theoretical predictions regarding group sizes apply only to deterministic \nWSLS, and there are reasons to doubt that they hold under noisy WSLS. For example, following \na conjecture by al-Nowaihi (personal communication, July 1, 2003), Colman (2005, Theorem 5) \nproved that, in a noisy version of the WSLS strategy that he called Optimistic Pavlov, in which a \nplayer chooses C whenever a deterministic WSLS player would choose C, and chooses D with \nprobability p (0 < p < 1) whenever a deterministic WSLS player would choose D with certainty, \nthe probability of cooperation converges to unity as the number of repetitions goes to infinity in \nMSS groups of every size, including odd-sized groups. A secondary aim of Experiment 1 was to \ncheck the validity of earlier findings on the two-player, strict MSS under conditions of \nautomated feedback and significant monetary incentives. \n \n2.1. Participants \nThe participants were 85 undergraduate and postgraduate students (49 women and 36 men), \nmean age 21.67 (SD = 4.00) years, recruited via an online experimental participant volunteer \npanel on the web pages of the University of Leicester. They volunteered to take part in what was \ndescribed as an experiment on decision making, and each participant earned between \u00a33.00 \n($6.00 at the conversion rate at that time) and \u00a316.00 ($32.00), M = \u00a311.56 ($23.12) according to \ntheir payoffs in the games. Participants were assigned randomly to ten two-player groups (n = \n20), five three-player groups (n = 15), five four-player groups (n = 20), and five six-player \ngroups (n = 30). \nMinimal Social Situations  9  \n \n \n \n2.2. Apparatus and General Instructions \nThe experiment was conducted in a laboratory furnished with six computer terminals \nseparated by partitions. Depending on treatment condition, players sat at either two, three, four, \nor six terminals that were networked and programmed to deliver feedback according to WSLS. \nEach player began by reading the following instructions from a printed sheet: \n \nThank you for coming here to take part in this experiment. The experiment is very simple, and the \ninstructions will appear on the screen in front of you. First, please fill in the consent forms, which also record \nyour age and sex. \nYou will be making a series of 200 decisions, by pressing J or K on the keyboard in front of you. The \ncomputer will not respond to any other key. You will be given \u00a33 to begin with, and then, after each decision, \nyou will be awarded either 5 pence or nothing. This means that, including the \u00a33 that has already been awarded \nto you, you can earn anything up to \u00a313 (if every decision is followed by 5 pence). This is real money, and you \nwill be paid your \u00a33 plus whatever you have earned on top of that at the end of the experiment. \nPlease do not confer with anyone else doing the experiment, and do not make any attempt to see what \nanyone else is doing. Everyone will be performing the same task. Although I cannot tell you how the payoffs \nare determined\u2014that is for you to try to figure out\u2014I can tell you that they are not random. If you concentrate \nand try hard, there is a possibility of increasing your earnings. \n \n2.3. Procedure \nThe experimenter initiated the first of the 200 rounds by instructing the players to \u2015please \npress J or K now.\u2016 As soon as a player pressed one of these keys, the following message \nappeared on the screen: \u2015Thank you. Calculating. . . .\u2016 After both or all players in the group had \nregistered their choices, a random delay uniformly distributed between 1 and 3 seconds occurred, \nthen each player received a screen message stating either \u2015You received 0p from your last \ndecision,\u2016 or \u2015You received 5p from your last decision,\u2016 followed by \u2015CONSIDER YOUR \nNEXT DECISION\u2016 and then, after a uniformly distributed random delay between 2 and 4 \nseconds, \u2015MAKE YOUR DECISION NOW.\u2016 The lengths of the delays, based on the results of a \npilot study, were designed to create a natural experience of interfacing with a stand-alone \ncomputer and to eliminate obvious clues pointing to the interdependence of the group members. \nAfter 200 rounds, the participants responded to a brief questionnaire about how they believed \ntheir payoffs were determined. They were then paid in cash the amounts that they had earned and \nwere promised a full debriefing by e-mail as soon as the experiment was completed. \n \n2.4. Results and Discussion \nThe postexperimental questionnaire responses confirmed that all participants believed that \nthey were involved in individual decision making, and none gave any indication of having \nguessed that they had been involved in interactive decisions. This corroborates what other \nresearchers have reported. \nMinimal Social Situations  10  \n \n \n0.35\n0.40\n0.45\n0.50\n0.55\n0.60\n0.65\n0.70\n0.75\n0.80\n0.85\n1 2 3 4\nTrial blocks\nC\no\no\np\ner\nat\niv\ne \nch\no\nic\nes\n (p\nro\np\no\nrt\nio\nn\ns)\n2 players\n3 players\n4 players\n6 players\n  \nFig. 3.

Error bars represent \u00b11\/2 standard errors of the means. \n \nProportions of cooperative choices over four trial blocks, each representing 50 rounds, are \nshown in Fig. 3. There appear to have been more cooperative choices in two-player than in larger \ngroups, in the first trial block and throughout the 200 rounds of the experiment, but the effect of \ngroup size is nonsignificant: F(3, 81) = 1.56, ns. For two-player groups, the proportions of \ncooperative choices appear to have increased across trial blocks, but this effect narrowly fails to \nreach significance: F(3, 57) = 2.28, p = .09. For three-player groups, differences across trial \nblocks are nonsignificant, F(3, 42) = 0.33, ns, and similarly for four-player groups, F(3, 57) = \n0.36, ns and six-player groups, F(3, 87) = 0.59, ns. \nThe data in this experiment and the ones that follow are actually time series, with potential \nserial dependence between successive outcomes over rounds, and time series analysis provides \nmore appropriate and much more sensitive methods of data analysis than repeated-measures or \nmixed-design ANOVA. We therefore carried out several standard time series analysis \nprocedures\u2014curve estimation, exponential smoothing, and ARIMA model identification, \nestimation, and diagnosis\u2014separately for two-player, three-player, four-player, and six-player \ngroups, using the proportion of cooperative choices per group per round as the unit of analysis. \nDetails of the time series analyses of all experiments are given in the Appendix. For the data of \nExperiment 1, time series analysis confirmed a significant linear increase in cooperative choices \nover the 200 rounds in two-player groups only, with no evidence of any adaptive learning \nwhatsoever in three-player, four-player, and six-player groups, where the data appear to have \nbeen random walks.

Proportions of win\u2013stay, lose\u2013shift, win\u2013shift, and lose\u2013\nstay choices are plotted separately for two-player, three-player, four-player, and six-player \ngroups in Fig. 5. According to the deterministic WSLS rule, win\u2013stay and lose\u2013shift choices are \nmandatory, whereas win\u2013shift and lose\u2013stay choices are errors. The first and most important \npoint to notice is that win\u2013stay choices were approximately twice as frequent as win\u2013shift \nchoices throughout the 200 rounds of the game in groups of all sizes. This means that whenever \nplayers cooperated, their successors repeated their previous strategy choice more than twice as \noften as they switched strategies, and this trend increased over trial blocks in two-player groups. \nThe difference between lose\u2013shift and lose\u2013stay is less clear. It is evident from Fig. 5 that win\u2013\nstay choices were generally more frequent than lose\u2013shift choices in groups of all sizes, although \nboth are mandatory in deterministic WSLS. In two-player groups only, the proportions of win\u2013\nstay choices increased over trial blocks from .40 in Trial Block 1 to .55 in Trial Block 4. In two-\nplayer groups, lose\u2013shift choices were much less common, and they declined slightly, from .22 \nin Trial Block 1 to .16 in Trial Block 4. In larger groups, win\u2013stay choices hovered between .30 \nand .40, and lose\u2013shift choices remained close to .25 and did not rise or fall markedly over trial \nblocks. Turning now to an examination of errors, win\u2013shift choices remained largely static \n(between .10 and .18) in two-player and multi-player groups of all sizes. Lose\u2013stay choices were \nalso largely static though slightly more frequent (between .16 and .26) in groups of all sizes, \nsuggesting a degree of inertia leading to more frequent errors following unrewarding rounds. \n \nMinimal Social Situations  12  \n \n \n0.00\n0.10\n0.20\n0.30\n0.40\n0.50\n0.60\n1 2 3 4\nC\nh\no\nic\nes\n (p\nro\np\no\nrt\nio\nn\ns)\nTrial blocks\nWin-stay\n2 players\n3 players\n4 players\n6 players\n \n0.00\n0.10\n0.20\n0.30\n0.40\n0.50\n0.60\n1 2 3 4\nC\nh\no\nic\nes\n (p\nro\np\no\nrt\nio\nn\ns)\nTrial blocks\nLose-shift\n2 players\n3 players\n4 players\n6 players\n \n0.00\n0.10\n0.20\n0.30\n0.40\n0.50\n0.60\n1 2 3 4\nC\nh\no\nic\nes\n (p\nro\np\no\nrt\nio\nn\ns)\nTrial blocks\nWin-shift\n2 players\n3 players\n4 players\n6 players\n \n0.00\n0.10\n0.20\n0.30\n0.40\n0.50\n0.60\n1 2 3 4\nC\nh\no\nic\nes\n (p\nro\np\no\nrt\nio\nn\ns)\nTrial blocks\nLose-stay\n2 players\n3 players\n4 players\n6 players\n \n  \nFig. 5.

An implication of the noisy WSLS model is that, as \nplayers within a group learn to cooperate over repeated rounds, correlations between their \nstrategy choices should increase relative to correlations between players in different groups. To \ntest this prediction, we computed phi coefficients (r\u03c6, equivalent to product-moment correlations \nfor binary variables) between the strategy choices of all pairs of players, separately for each \ngroup size and for each trial block, and we then calculated the mean values of those coefficients \nbetween pairs of players within the same group and the mean values between pairs of players in \ndifferent groups. For two-player groups, the mean phi coefficients for Trial Blocks 1 to 4 were \n.12, .32, .23, and .42, respectively, between players within the same groups, and .00, .01, .02, and \n.01, respectively, between players in different groups. For three-player, four-player, and six-\nplayer groups, the mean phi coefficients were all close to zero, ranging from \u2013.06 to .07 between \nplayers within the same groups and in different groups. These results are clearly in line with \npredictions from the WSLS model, given that adaptive learning occurred only in two-player \ngroups. \nDiscussion. The results are broadly in line with earlier research on the MSS (Mitropoulos, \n2001, 2003), with evidence for choice inertia in other areas of research (e.g., Cooper & Kagel, \n2008), and with accumulated evidence that reward tends to drive behavior change more \neffectively than punishment (Skinner, 1969). In two-player groups, time series analysis confirms \nsignificant but slow adaptive learning over the 200 rounds of the game. This is consistent with \nearlier research and with a theoretical interpretation based on a form of WSLS with \nmisimplementation noise. In larger groups, time series analysis revealed no evidence of adaptive \nlearning over rounds. Even in four-player groups, in which cooperative choices should increase \nrapidly according to deterministic WSLS theory, there was no evidence of any significant \nadaptive learning. Joint cooperation appears to be very difficult to achieve in groups larger than \nthe dyad, presumably because it takes only one wrong move for the whole process to unravel. In \nMinimal Social Situations  13  \n \n \na dyad, there is a reasonable chance of direct feedback reinforcing a cooperative response, but in \nlarger groups the feedback depends on two or more intermediary players who must also choose \nappropriately for the first choice to be reinforced. Because players probably tend to use a form of \nWSLS with misimplementation noise, the noise may drown the WSLS signal in larger groups, \neffectively blocking efficient adaptive learning. Experiment 2 was designed to establish whether \nthe cognitive environment of an informed MSS would reduce noise levels sufficiently to \nfacilitate adaptive learning in groups larger than the dyad. \n \n3. Experiment 2: Informed MSS \nThis experiment was essentially a replication of Experiment 1 with players who were \ninformed that they were involved in interactive decision making, although they were not \ninformed about the payoff structure. Given the lack of adaptive learning in larger groups in \nExperiment 1, only two-player, three-player, and four-player group sizes were investigated. \n \n3.1. Participants \nThe participants were 45 students from a sixth-form college (29 women and 16 men), mean \nage 17.44 (SD = 0.62) years, recruited as volunteers via staff members at the college. The \nvolunteers were told that they would take part in an experiment on decision making, and each \nparticipant earned between \u00a35.00 ($10.00) and \u00a314.50 ($29.00), M = \u00a310.25 ($20.50), according \nto their payoffs in the games. Participants were assigned randomly to five two-player groups (n = \n10), five three-player groups (n = 15), and five four-player groups (n = 20). \n \n3.2. Procedure \nThe instructions and general procedure were as in Experiment 1, apart from the following \nadditional information that was read out to each group before the sequence of decisions began: \n \nOne further piece of information I can give you is that all computers are linked together, which means that your \npayments may be affected by others in the group. It is for you to work out how the payments are determined, \nand the aim of the experiment is to maximize the amount of money that you earn. If you concentrate and try \nhard, there is a possibility of increasing your earnings. \n \nThis was designed to replicate the informed MSS conditions studied by previous researchers, \npossibly facilitating adaptive learning of mutually rewarding cooperative choices. As in \nExperiment 1, 200 rounds were played. \n \n3.3. Results and Discussion \nProportions of cooperative choices over trial blocks are shown in Fig. 6. Once again, \ncooperative choices appear to have been more frequent in two-player than in larger groups. In \nthis case, the effect of group size is significant, F(2, 42) = 3.94, p = .03. A Tukey-HSD post-hoc \ntest confirmed that the mean number of cooperative choices is larger in the two-player than the \nthree-player groups, and that the means in the three-player and four-player groups do not differ \nsignificantly, nor do the means in the two-player and four-player groups. In two-player groups, \ncooperative choices appear to have increased over the first three trial blocks and to have declined \nin the fourth, but the overall trial block effect is nonsignificant: F(3, 27) = 1.24, ns. For the larger \ngroups, there is no evidence of adaptive learning, and the trial block effect is nonsignificant for \nthree-player groups, F(3, 42) = 0.71, ns, and four-player groups, F(3, 57) = 1.35, ns. The \nadaptive learning that must have occurred, given the significant main effect of group size, was \nMinimal Social Situations  14  \n \n \nover by the end of Trial Block 1. Time series analysis (see Appendix) provided no evidence for \nsustained adaptive learning across the entire time series in groups of any size. \n \n0.35\n0.40\n0.45\n0.50\n0.55\n0.60\n0.65\n0.70\n0.75\n0.80\n0.85\n1 2 3 4\nTrial blocks\nC\no\no\np\ner\nat\niv\ne \nch\no\nic\nes\n (p\nro\np\no\nrt\nio\nn\ns) 2 players\n3 players\n4 players\n  \nFig. 6.

The results confirm the slightly surprising finding of previous researchers that \nadaptive learning is not noticeably better under informed than strict MSS conditions. Although \nour informed dyads cooperated significantly more than three-player or four-player groups, they \nactually performed slightly worse than the uninformed dyads in the strict MSS in Experiment 1. \nUnder the informed conditions of this experiment, dyad members, although they knew that they \nwere strategically interdependent, were unable to coordinate their choices even as effectively as \nthe dyads in Experiment 1, and knowledge of strategic interdependence seems only to have \nconfused them. Perhaps this is a manifestation of Humphrey\u2019s law (Humphrey, 1951), according \nto which, in some circumstances, ignorance is bliss, and knowledge can interfere with efficient \nautomatic processing. A familiar example of this is the Stroop effect, in which color names such \nas BLUE and RED are displayed in unrelated colors, and knowledge of what the words mean \nimpedes one\u2019s ability to name the colors in which they are displayed (Stroop, 1935). The results \nfrom three-player and four-player groups were essentially the same as those of Experiment 1: \nneither time series showed any evidence of significant adaptive learning. In three-player and \nfour-player groups, cooperative choices actually declined slightly over rounds, although ARIMA \nmodeling suggested that the series were random walks. \nAnother way of looking at the results is to recognize that players must have entertained and \nattempted to test numerous idiosyncratic hypotheses in an effort to understand the pattern of \nrewards, and one reason why performance was worse in this experiment, when players knew that \nthere were other players involved, may have been that this knowledge increased the number of \nfalse hypotheses to consider. \n \n4. Experiment 3: Discursive MSS \nIn this modified replication of Experiment 2, only 50 rounds were played, and the players \nwere not informed at the outset that they were involved in interactive decision making, but the \nMinimal Social Situations  15  \n \n \nprocedure was stopped after every 10 rounds to allow them to discuss the task among \nthemselves. In addition to the period discussion breaks, after 30 rounds, players were informed \nthat they were involved in interactive decision making, but they were not informed about the \npayoff structure, and after 50 rounds the game was terminated. The aim of this experiment was to \ndetermine whether these additional manipulations would prove sufficient to enable adaptive \nlearning to occur. After the failure of mere information about being involved in interactive \ndecision making to facilitate adaptive learning in Experiment 2, the primary purpose of \nExperiment 3 was to discover whether periodic discussion among the players might achieve this \neffect in two-player, three-player, and four-player groups. \n \n4.1. Participants \nThe participants were 45 undergraduate and postgraduate students (27 women and 18 men), \nmean age 20.40 (SD = 2.40) years, recruited via an online experimental participant volunteer \npanel on the web pages of the University of Leicester. They volunteered to take part in what was \ndescribed as an experiment on decision making, and each participant earned between \u00a33.05 \n($6.10) and \u00a39.50 ($19.00), M = \u00a35.25 ($10.50), according to their payoffs in the games. \nParticipants were assigned randomly to five two-player groups (n = 10), five three-player groups \n(n = 15), and five four-player groups (n = 20). \n \n4.2. Procedure \nThe instructions and procedure were as in Experiment 2, apart from the restriction to 50 \nrounds, the breaks for discussion among the members of each group after every 10 rounds, and \nthe withholding of information about the player\u2019 strategic interdependence until after 30 rounds. \nPartly because of the smaller number of rounds, incentive payments were increased from 5p (10 \ncents) or nothing to 50p ($1.00) or nothing on each round, with no \u2015free\u2016 money for merely \nshowing up. The instructions included the following: \n \nYou will be making a series of 50 decisions, by pressing J or K on the keyboard in front of you. The \ncomputer will not respond to any other key. After each decision, you will be awarded either 50p or nothing. \nThis means that you can earn anything up to \u00a325 (if every decision is followed by 50p). This is real money, and \nyou will be paid at the end of the experiment. \nPlease do not confer with anyone else doing the experiment, and do not make any attempt to see what \nanyone else is doing. Everyone will be performing the same task. Although I cannot tell you how the payoffs \nare determined\u2014that is for you to try to figure out\u2014I can tell you that they are not random. If you concentrate \nand try hard, there is a possibility of increasing your earnings. \n \nAfter each block of 10 rounds, the experimenter invited the group members to discuss the \ntask for up to one minute. After 30 rounds, the experimenter made the following announcement: \n\u2015I can tell you that your payoffs are affected by the decisions of other members of the group.\u2016 \nAfter 50 rounds, the game was terminated. \n \n4.3. Results and Discussion \nProportions of cooperative choices over trial blocks are shown in Fig. 7. As in Experiments 1 \nand 2, the proportion was greater in two-player groups (M = .63) than three-player groups (M = \n.53) or four-player groups (M = .50), and the three means differ significantly: F(2, 147) = 9.99, p \n< .001. A posteriori Tukey-HSD tests confirmed that there were more cooperative choices in \ntwo-player groups than in either of the larger-sized groups but that the frequency of cooperative \nchoices did not differ significantly between three-player and four-player groups. \nMinimal Social Situations  16  \n \n \n \n0.35\n0.40\n0.45\n0.50\n0.55\n0.60\n0.65\n0.70\n0.75\n0.80\n0.85\n1 2 3 4 5\nTrial blocks\nC\no\no\np\ner\nat\niv\ne \nch\no\nic\nes\n (p\nro\np\no\nrt\nio\nn\ns) 2 players\n3 players\n4 players\n  \nFig. 7. Experiment 3: Discursive MSS. Proportions of cooperative choices over five trial blocks in groups of varying \nsizes. Error bars represent \u00b11 standard errors of the means. \n \nAdaptive learning began earlier and occurred relatively rapidly in two-player groups, \nreaching .80 after 50 rounds. In three-player groups, it was only after the players were told at the \nend of the third trial block that they were strategically interdependent that adaptive learning \noccurred rapidly and efficiently. This finding should be viewed in perspective, taking into \naccount that it relates to just 15 participants (five three-player groups). An examination of the \nperformance of individual groups reveals that two of the five groups were cooperating perfectly \nin the final trial block, and two\u2014interestingly, the groups whose cooperation rates were highest \nin the first two trial blocks\u2014showed little or no increase in cooperation in the last two trial \nblocks. It appears that two three-player groups solved the problem through insight once they \nwere told, after the third trial block, that they were strategically interdependent, and the other \nthree-player groups did not. There is little evidence of any adaptive learning in the four-player \ngroups. Time series analysis (see Appendix) confirmed an increase in cooperative choices over \nrounds in two-player and three-player groups, with data from four-player groups resembling \nrandom walks. \nDiscussion. Once again, significantly more cooperation occurred in two-player than in larger \ngroups. Allowing players to stop after every 10 rounds to discuss the task, and informing them \nafter 30 of the 50 rounds that they were involved in interactive decision making, appear to have \nhad some effect, though less than might have been anticipated. Adaptive learning occurred in \ntwo-player and possibly three-player groups, although in three-player groups it was evident only \nin two groups, after players were informed that they were making interactive decisions. \nDiscussion and information about interactive linkage appears to have been insufficient to \nstimulate adaptive learning in four-player groups. \n \n5. Experiment 4: Gain\u2013loss MSS \nThis experiment was a replication of Experiment 2 with a considerably enhanced incentive \nstructure and just 50 rather than 200 rounds. Because our earlier experiments had unambiguously \nconfirmed that adaptive learning can occur in two-player MSS groups, only three-player and \nfour-player MSS groups were investigated. Players were given \u00a35.00 ($10.00) at the beginning \nMinimal Social Situations  17  \n \n \nof the experiment, and over the course of 50 rounds were rewarded with \u00a31.00 ($2.00) every \ntime players designated as their predecessors made cooperative choices and fined 50p ($1.00) \nevery time their predecessors made noncooperative choices. This high-incentive gain\u2013loss \nincentive scheme was motivated by the finding first reported in a classic study of Tversky and \nEdwards (1966) that significantly more normatively optimal choices are observed when \nmonetary gains and losses are assigned to decision makers\u2019 choices (see Smith & Walker, 1993, \nfor a review of experimental studies corroborating and extending this finding). \n \n5.1. Participants \nThe participants were 35 undergraduate and postgraduate students (16 women and 19 men), \nmean age 20.69 (SD = 3.99) years, recruited via an online experimental participant volunteer \npanel on the web pages of the University of Leicester. They volunteered to take part in what was \ndescribed as an experiment on decision making, and participants ended up with earnings ranging \nfrom zero (one participant) to \u00a350.00 ($100.00, two participants), M = \u00a316.44 ($32.88), \naccording to their payoffs in the games. Participants were assigned randomly to five three-player \ngroups (n = 15) and five four-player groups (n = 20). \n \n5.2. Procedure \nThe instructions and general procedure were as in Experiment 2 (informed MSS), but only 50 \nrounds were played for much larger financial incentives, incorporating both gains and losses. \nThe key part of the instructions was as follows: \n \nYou will be making a series of 50 decisions, by pressing J or K on the keyboard in front of you. The \ncomputer will not respond to any other key. You will be given \u00a35 to begin with, and then, after each decision, \nyou will be awarded either \u00a31.00 if you make the correct decision or lose 50p if you make the incorrect \ndecision. This means that you can earn anything up to \u00a350 (if every decision is followed by \u00a31.00). This is real \nmoney, and you will be paid at the end of the experiment. \nI cannot tell you exactly how the payments are determined, but I can tell you that they are not random. One \nfurther piece of information I can give you is that all the computers are linked together, which means that your \npayments may be affected by others in the group. It is for you to work out how the payments are determined, \nand the aim of the experiment is to maximize the amount of money that you earn. If you concentrate and try \nhard, there is a possibility of increasing your earnings. \nPlease do not confer with anyone else doing the experiment, and do not make any attempt to see what \nanyone else is doing. Everyone will be performing the same task. \n \n5.3. Results and Discussion \nProportions of cooperative choices over trial blocks are shown in Fig. 8. Overall, the \nproportion was slightly larger in four-player groups (M = .59) than three-player groups (M = \n.51), but this difference is nonsignificant: F(1, 8) = 0.53, ns. The effects of trial blocks, F(1, 8) = \n0.11, and the Group Size \u00d7 Trial Blocks interaction, F(1, 8) = 0.80, are both nonsignificant. Time \nseries analysis (see Appendix) suggested no clear trend in three-player or four-player groups. \n \nMinimal Social Situations  18  \n \n \n0.35\n0.40\n0.45\n0.50\n0.55\n0.60\n0.65\n0.70\n0.75\n0.80\n0.85\n1 2 3 4 5\nTrial blocks\nC\no\no\np\ner\nat\niv\ne \nch\no\nic\nes\n (p\nro\np\no\nrt\nio\nn\ns)\n3 players\n4 players\n  \nFig. 8.

Very large financial incentives, involving both gains and losses, did not help to \nactivate adaptive learning in three-player or four-player informed MSS groups, at least not \nrapidly enough to become significant within the 50 rounds of the experiment, even under \nsensitive time series analysis. Taken together with the findings of the experiments described \nabove, this establishes without any remaining doubt that adaptive learning is extremely difficult \nin MSS groups larger than the dyad. \n \n6. Monte Carlo simulation: Parameters for noisy MSS \nIt is clear from the four experiments described above that adaptive learning occurs slowly in \ntwo-player MSS groups but is extremely difficult to elicit in three-player or larger MSS groups. \nAccording to deterministic WSLS theory, rapid adaptive learning should occur in two-player and \nfour-player groups, and also in a small proportion of six-player groups (depending on initial \nchoices). However, the standard WSLS decision rule incorporates an unrealistic assumption of \ndeterministic choice. Our hypothesis is that players implement a degraded form of WSLS with \nmisimplementation noise. This seems the simplest and most natural decision rule suitable for the \ninformationally impoverished conditions of a strict MSS. \nThe most important challenge is to explain the results of strict MSS experiments, both two-\nplayer and multiplayer. If, as we hypothesize, the slow adaptive learning observed in two-player \nMSS groups is explained by players implementing a degraded form WSLS with \nmisimplementation noise, then why does this not also occur in four-player groups? After all, \nfrom the point of view of the individual player, the task appears identical\u2014the player does not \neven know that the group exists, still less what size it is. \nOne obvious explanation for this group size effect is that noisy decision making, \ncharacteristic of human behavior, undermines the efficacy of the WSLS decision rule in groups \nlarger than a dyad. For example, in a two-player MSS with noise, a joint cooperative outcome or \nsequence of outcomes might be disrupted by a player misimplementing a D instead of a C choice \non Round t, in spite of having received a rewarding payoff on Round t \u2013 1. In the absence of any \nfurther errors, joint cooperation is re-established within two further rounds. But the picture is \nvery different in a multiplayer MSS with misimplementation noise. Following a joint cooperative \noutcome, if a single player misimplements D instead of C immediately after receiving a \nMinimal Social Situations  19  \n \n \nrewarding payoff, the outcome is followed, in the absence of any further errors, by joint \ncooperation only after several further rounds\u2014up to four rounds in a four-player MSS, and later \nstill in larger groups. With high noise levels, it is unlikely that these corrective rounds will be \ncompleted without further misimplementation errors, and any error that does occur is more likely \nto lengthen than to shorten the path back to joint cooperation. Although all outcome \nconfigurations in group sizes that are powers of 2, and some configurations in other even-sized \ngroups, lead back to joint cooperation under deterministic WSLS, misimplementation noise is \nlikely to disable the WSLS corrective mechanism in groups larger than the dyad. \nAnother way of looking at repetitive decisions under restricted information is to interpret \ninitial exploratory decisions as noise, and to assume, in line with research on k-armed bandit \nproblems (Gittins, 1989; Holland, 1975; Schmalensee, 1975), that exploration tends to decline \nover trials. Whether or not there exist declining noise levels that might generate results similar to \nthose observed in our experiments is an empirical question that can be investigated through \nMonte Carlo methods. Accordingly, we programmed a noisy WSLS computational algorithm, \nusing the assumption of exponentially decaying misimplementation noise over successive \nrounds.1 Exponential noise decay is mathematically simple inasmuch as it assumes that the rate \nof decrease is a constant proportion of the absolute noise level, and it is also in line with \nHolland\u2019s proof that, for optimal learning in two-armed bandit problems, exploratory trials \nshould be allocated to the better arm at an exponentially increasing rate and to the worse arm at \nan exponentially decreasing rate. Our algorithm accepts as input parameters the initial noise level \n(the probability of a choice being misimplemented according to deterministic WSLS) and the \nhalf-life for exponential noise decay, and these parameters can be set independently for choices \nfollowing rewarding and unrewarding rounds, to take account of the possibility of closer \nadherence to win\u2013stay than to lose\u2013shift. Using this computational algorithm, we performed grid \nsearches for approximate values that minimized the sum of absolute differences between \nobserved and predicted trial block means for each of our experiments. All simulation results \nwere averaged over 10,000 replications. \n \n6.1. Experiment 1 Simulation \nFor Experiment 1, the grid search revealed an asymmetric set of parameters that provided a \ngood fit to most of the data. These parameters included initial noise levels of 20% after \nrewarding rounds and 50% after unrewarding rounds, in general agreement with our finding, and \nthat of Mitropoulos (2001, 2003), of closer adherence to win\u2013stay than to lose\u2013shift. With the \nhalf-life of the exponential noise decay set to 200 rounds, the simulation results are compared \nwith the empirical results in Table 1. A striking feature of the simulation is that our noisy WSLS \nmodel predicts substantial cooperative learning only in two-player groups, and not in four-player \ngroups, in line with our experimental findings, although deterministic WSLS would yields rapid \ncooperative learning in both two-player and four-player groups. The fit is reasonably close for \nmost group sizes, though noticeably less so for six-player groups. This was partly due to one of \nthe six-player experimental groups cooperating much more than the others. When this unusually \nsuccessful group is omitted, the simulated values are closer to the empirical proportions. \n \nMinimal Social Situations  20  \n \n \nTable 1 \nProportions of Cooperative Choices in Experiment 1 Compared to Monte Carlo Results \n Rounds \nGroup size 1\u201350 51\u2013100 101\u2013150 151\u2013200 \n2     \nExperiment .57 .59 .65 .67 \nMonte Carlo .54 .58 .62 .67 \n3     \nExperiment .50 .53 .49 .51 \nMonte Carlo .50 .50 .51 .52 \n4     \nExperiment .50 .53 .51 .50 \nMonte Carlo .50 .50 .50 .51 \n6     \nExperimenta .55 .56 .58 .56 \n (.51) (.53) (.57) (.52) \nMonte Carlo .50 .50 .50 .50 \nNote.

Comparison with empirical error data \nThe win\u2013shift, lose\u2013stay error analysis from Experiment 1, shown in Section 2.4, provided \nempirical data that can be usefully compared with the simulation results. Dividing the \nempirically observed win\u2013shift choices by the sum of the win\u2013stay and win\u2013shift choices yields \nthe proportion of \u2015erroneous\u2016 choices following rewarding rounds; and dividing the lose\u2013stay \nchoices by the sum of the lose\u2013shift and lose\u2013stay choices yields the proportion of \u2015erroneous\u2016 \nchoices following unrewarding rounds. In two-player groups, the proportions of errors following \nrewarding rounds decline steadily from .29 in Trial Block 1 to .16 in Trial Block 4, and in larger \ngroups, the proportions lie between .37 and .23 for all trial blocks, without any clearly \ndiscernable pattern. The proportions of errors following unrewarding rounds lie between .56 and \n.45 in groups of all sizes, again with no obvious pattern. \nThe empirical frequency of win\u2013shift choices\u2014between .16 and .32 for 14 of the 16 trial \nblock means across all four group sizes\u2014is roughly consistent with the Monte Carlo estimate of \ninitial 20% misimplementation noise following reward. Following unrewarding rounds, the \nempirical proportions of erroneous lose\u2013stay choices were between .45 and .56 for all 16 trial \nblock means, and this is roughly consistent with the Monte Carlo estimate of 50% initial noise \nfollowing unrewarding rounds. These comparisons of empirically observed deviations from \ndeterministic WSLS and Monte Carlo noise estimates reinforce our confidence in our \ninterpretation of how the experimental data may have been generated. \n \n6.3. Experiments 2, 3, and 4 Simulations \nSimulation and empirical results for Experiment 2 are compared in Table 2. In this \nexperiment, the players were informed that their decisions were interactively linked with those of \nother group members, but our proposed model, with initial noise levels of 20% after rewarding \nMinimal Social Situations  21  \n \n \nrounds and 50% after unrewarding rounds, decaying exponentially with a half-life of 200 rounds, \nremains a moderately good fit to the data. The most striking discrepancies are in the final block \nof rounds, especially in the two-player and three-player groups, where the experimental data \nshow slight declines in cooperation not predicted by the model (compare Fig. 6). \n \nTable 2 \nProportions of Cooperative Choices in Experiment 2 Compared to Monte Carlo Results \n Rounds \nGroup size 1\u201350 51\u2013100 101\u2013150 151\u2013200 \n2     \nExperiment .58 .61 .64 .60 \nMonte Carlo .54 .58 .62 .67 \n3     \nExperiment .47 .47 .49 .43 \nMonte Carlo .50 .50 .51 .52 \n4     \nExperiment .54 .56 .53 .48 \nMonte Carlo .50 .50 .50 .51 \nNote. Initial noise levels: 20% after rewarding rounds; 50% after unrewarding rounds. Number of rounds to 50% \nexponential noise reduction: 200. Proportions shown are means from 10,000 replications. \n \nIn Experiment 3, players discussed the task among themselves after every block of 10 \nrounds, and after 30 rounds they were informed that they were involved in interactive decision \nmaking. The simulation results are compared to the empirical results in Table 3. In this case, a \nbetter fit was obtained, most notably so for two-player groups, by assuming more rapid \nexponential noise decay, with a half-life of 25 rounds. This is easily understood as a consequence \nof the reduction in the total number of rounds from 200 to 50 and the discussion among the \nplayers under the conditions of this experiment. The sudden increase in cooperation in three-\nplayer groups in the last trial block was not predicted by our model. It was caused by the \nbehavior of two groups whose members apparently gained sudden insight into the problem after \nbeing told that the group members were linked. Our WSLS model predicts adaptive learning in \nthe absence of insight, and it is obvious that the learning process can be overridden or short-\ncircuited if collective insight is achieved in a group. This occurred in just two groups whose \nmembers were permitted to discuss the problem regularly among themselves and were also given \na big clue after 30 rounds. Behavior in these unusual circumstances falls outside the scope of our \nWSLS model, but it is a real and important phenomenon. \n \nMinimal Social Situations  22  \n \n \nTable 3 \nProportions of Cooperative Choices in Experiment 3 Compared to Monte Carlo Results \n Rounds \nGroup size 1\u201310 11\u201320 21\u201330 31\u201340 41\u201350 \n2      \nExperiment .48 .55 .62 .72 .80 \nMonte Carlo      \n(20, 50; 200)1 .52 .53 .54 .55 .55 \n(20, 50; 25)1 .53 .61 .68 .75 .81 \n3      \nExperiment .49 .51 .43 .43 .76 \nMonte Carlo      \n(20, 50; 200)1 .50 .50 .50 .50 .50 \n(20, 50; 25)1 .50 .51 .52 .53 .55 \n4      \nExperiment .49 .52 .48 .50 .53 \nMonte Carlo      \n(20, 50; 200)1 .50 .50 .50 .50 .50 \n(20, 50; 25)1 .49 .50 .51 .54 .58 \n1 (x, y; z) denotes initial noise levels: x% after rewarding rounds; y% after unrewarding rounds; z rounds to 50% \nexponential noise reduction.

Simulation and empirical data \nare compared in Table 4. Once again a slightly better fit was obtained by assuming rapid noise \ndecay, with a half-life of 25 rounds. In this case, it seems that the increased rate of noise decay \nwas a consequence of the reduction in the total number of rounds from 200 to 50 and of raising \nthe stakes and thereby presumably encouraging players to invest more cognitive effort in the \ntask. \n \nMinimal Social Situations  23  \n \n \nTable 4 \nProportions of Cooperative Choices in Experiment 4 Compared to Monte Carlo Results \n Rounds \nGroup size 1\u201310 11\u201320 21\u201330 31\u201340 41\u201350 \n3      \nExperiment .49 .47 .44 .59 .55 \nMonte Carlo      \n(20, 50; 200)1 .50 .50 .50 .50 .50 \n(20, 50; 25)1 .50 .51 .52 .53 .55 \n4      \nExperiment .62 .59 .61 .60 .54 \nMonte Carlo      \n(20, 50; 200)1 .50 .50 .50 .50 .50 \n(20, 50; 25)1 .49 .50 .51 .54 .58 \n1 (x, y; z) denotes initial noise levels: x% after rewarding rounds; y% after unrewarding rounds; z rounds to 50% \nexponential noise reduction. Proportions shown are means from 10,000 replications. \n \n6.4. Models of Decisions From Experience \nA number of models have been developed to predict \u2015decisions from experience\u2016 involving \nreinforcement learning in tasks that, from the decision maker\u2019s point of view, are similar to the \nMSS, but that include a wider range of binary decision tasks (Erev & Haruvy, in press). Some of \nthese models are capable of predicting the results of our experiments. \nBarron and Erev (2003) developed a value-assessment model that they showed to be \nsuccessful at predicting repetitive individual decisions when information available to decision \nmakers is limited to feedback about outcomes on previous trials. In the value-assessment model, \nthe value of a decision j is initially the subjective expected value from random choice; then the \nadjusted value Aj on trial t + 1 is \nAj(t + 1) = (1 \u2013 wt)Aj(t) + (wt)v(xt), \nwhere v(xt) is the subjective value of the payoff xt weighted by 0 < wt < 1. Decision makers are \nassumed to use exploration (random choice) on early trials. The probability of exploration is 1 on \nthe first trial and declines with experience. To model greater reliance on recent outcomes than on \noutcomes in the more distant past (myopic decision making), wt = \u03b1 if t is an exploration trial, the \nprobability of this being the case decreasing with experience, and wt = \u03b2 otherwise, with 0  \u03b2  \n\u03b1 < 1. To model loss aversion (greater sensitivity of decision makers to losses than to gains of \nequivalent absolute size), v(xi) = xi if xi  0 and v(xi) = \u03bbxi if xi < 0, with \u03bb > 1. Except on \nexploration trials, a decision maker is assumed to choose the alternative with the highest \nsubjective value. Barron and Erev found that this simple model can predict several nontrivial \ndecision-making phenomena. With suitable parameter settings it can emulate (generate the same \ngeneral pattern of results as) noisy WSLS in minimal social situations (I. Erev, personal \ncommunication, April 12, 2010). \nThe explorative sampler model (Erev, Ert, & Yechiam, 2008) was the most successful \nbaseline model for repeated decisions from experience in a choice prediction competition \norganized by Erev, Ert, Roth et al. (2010). In this model, decision makers use two cognitive \nstrategies, namely exploration (random choice) and exploitation. The probability of exploration \nis 1 on the first trial and declines toward an asymptote with experience, the rate of decline \nMinimal Social Situations  24  \n \n \ndepending on the total number of trials that the decision maker anticipates. On an exploitation \ntrial t, the decision maker draws from memory, randomly with replacement, a sample of mt past \nexperiences\u2014outcomes from previous trials for each alternative. The recalled subjective value of \nan outcome x is affected by regression to the mean of all experiences with the same alternative, \nand with diminishing sensitivity (decreasing sensitivity to changes in absolute payoff with \nincreasing distance from zero) and loss aversion. The regressed value is Rx = (1 \u2013 w)x + (w)Aj(t), \nwhere 0 < w < 1 is a free parameter and Aj(t) is the average payoff from alternative j on trial t. \nDiminishing sensitivity and loss aversion are modeled with the value function \n             if  0\n( ) ,\n   if  0\nt\nR Rx xsv x\nt\nR Rx x\n \nwhere \u03b1(t) = (1 + Vt)\n(\u2013\u03c1), \u03c1 \u2265 0, is a free parameter capturing the effect of diminishing sensitivity, \nand Vt is a measure of payoff variability. On every exploitation trial, a decision maker is assumed \nto choose the alternative with the higher subjective value. \nAccording to Ido Erev (personal communication, April 12, 2010), the explorative sampler \nmodel emulates noisy WSLS in minimal social situations, and good emulation occurs even with \nthe parameters that best fit the individual choice task studied by Erev, Ert, Roth et al. (2010). In \nspite of this, for interpreting results from minimal social situations, the WSLS decision rule has \ntwo major advantages over the explorative sampler, value-assessment model, and other leading \nmodels of decision from experience. The first arises from Ockham\u2019s razor, the principle of \neconomy of explanation according to which assumptions should not be multiplied beyond \nnecessity (entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem), and hence simple explanations \nshould generally be preferred to more complex ones. Popper (1959, section 43), in a discussion \nof \u2015simplicity and degree of falsifiability,\u2016 argued that simpler rules or laws are generally \npreferable because they are more refutable. Noisy WSLS is obviously far simpler than the value-\nassessment model, the explorative sampler, and other models reviewed by Erev, Ert, Roth, et al. \n(2010) and Erev and Haruvy (in press). Noisy WSLS should therefore be preferred as an \nexplanation of behavior in minimal social situations, even if some of the more complex models \ncan emulate it. Second, it encapsulates the most primitive form of the law of effect, for which \nthere is over a century of empirical support across a very wide range of behavioral domains. \nNoisy WSLS takes no specific account of well established decision making phenomena such as \nloss aversion and inaccurate weighting of rare events, and it is therefore all the more impressive \nthat it provides a compelling interpretation and remarkably good predictions of behavior in \nminimal social situations. However, we should not expect it to be notably successful at \npredicting results from binary decision tasks unrelated to minimal social situations. \n \n7. General discussion \nExperiments reported here provide clear evidence that adaptive learning of cooperative \nbehavior can occur without awareness in the two-player MSS, even under strict information \nconditions, with properly controlled experimental conditions implemented through networked \ncomputers. This confirms the findings of previous experiments, invariably (in the case of strict \nMSS) performed without adequate incentives for the players and in many cases lacking adequate \nexperimental control. However, in spite of our significant financial incentives and automated \ncontrol techniques, we found no evidence of adaptive learning in three-player, four-player, or \nsix-player MSS groups. \nMinimal Social Situations  25  \n \n \nIt seems likely that at least some human decision makers respond to the strict MSS with a \nnoisy form of WSLS. Because WSLS is merely a version of the law of effect applicable in binary \nchoice situations with severely restricted information, and bearing in mind that the law of effect \nhas been found to have very wide applicability, it would be surprising if it did not govern \nbehavior in MSS situations. Furthermore, without assuming that decision makers use noisy \nWSLS, or some functionally equivalent decision rule of decisions from experience, it seems \nimpossible to explain the adaptive learning in the two-player MSS that has been reported by \nprevious experimenters and that we have replicated in our own research, reported above. \nIn Experiments 2, 3, and 4, we examined the effects of various manipulations designed to \nfacilitate adaptive learning, but they proved largely unsuccessful. Even when very large incentive \npayments were on offer and group members were allowed to discuss the task among themselves \nat frequent intervals, cooperative choices generally failed to increase significantly over rounds in \nmultiplayer groups. It was only in three-player groups in Experiment 3, when very large \nincentive payments were offered, discussion among group members was allowed, and players \nwere informed after 30 rounds that they were strategically interdependent, that significant \nincreases in C choices began abruptly in two groups in the final trial block, evidently as a \nconsequence of sudden collective insight in two groups\u2014an important phenomenon that falls \noutside the scope of our WSLS adaptive learning model. The results from our four-player groups \npresent a particularly challenging problem of interpretation, because deterministic WSLS \npredicts a rapid increase in cooperative choices in four-player groups. However, the results of \nour experiments showed no significant increases in cooperative choices in four-player groups. \nWe interpret the results from all four experiments as evidence that WSLS with \nmisimplementation noise is generally ineffective at eliciting cooperation in groups larger than the \ndyad, presumably because an aberrant choice\u2014a D choice that should have been a C choice \naccording to deterministic WSLS, or vice versa\u2014takes several rounds to work its way through a \nmultiplayer group, and with a high noise level this process is unlikely to be completed before \nanother aberrant choice is made by one of the players. \nThis interpretation is confirmed by our Monte Carlo simulations. Assuming that players \nfollow the spirit of WSLS but begin with errors on 20% of rounds immediately following \nrewarding payoffs and on 50% of rounds immediately following unrewarding payoffs, and that \nthese noise levels decay exponentially, we were able to generate patterns of results \napproximating those of all four experiments. This enables us to suggest a coherent explanation of \nour findings, and in particular of our failure to observe significant adaptive learning in four-\nplayer MSS groups. \nThe deterministic WSLS decision rule works as reliably in the four-player MSS as it does in \nthe two-player MSS, but its built-in error-correcting property breaks down in the four-player \nMSS under sufficiently high levels of misimplementation noise. The following examples, using \nthe noise levels derived from our Monte Carlo simulations, should help to clarify this. Suppose \nthat the configuration (D, C, C, C) occurs in a four-player MSS. Under deterministic WSLS, this \nwould be followed in four steps by joint cooperation: (D, D, C, C), (D, C, D, C), (D, D, D, D), \n(C, C, C, C). Assuming (reasonably) that errors are uncorrelated, the probability of all four of \nthese steps occurring correctly with 20% noise following a rewarding round and 50% noise \nfollowing an unrewarding round is (4\/5)7 \u00d7 (1\/2)9 = .0004. In a two-player MSS, by way of \ncontrast, the configuration (D, C) is followed in two steps by joint cooperation: (D, D), (C, C), \nand the probability of this occurring correctly with 20% noise following a rewarding round and \n50% noise following an unrewarding round is (4\/5) \u00d7 (1\/2)3 = .10. Hence, in the two-player \nMinimal Social Situations  26  \n \n \nMSS, there is a fighting chance of success, enabling cooperation to develop slowly, but in the \nfour-player MSS there is virtually none, and as group size increases, the probability diminishes \neven further. These indicative calculations suggest that adaptive learning can occur, though with \nsome difficulty, in two-player MSS groups but not in larger MSS groups. In a multiplayer MSS, \na group that strays from the WSLS path faces a route back that is too long to navigate before \nfurther wrong turns are taken, and the errant group is therefore likely to get lost unless it \nstumbles on joint cooperation by chance. \nExperimentation with our WSLS simulator tends to corroborate this interpretation in four-\nplayer groups. With initial noise up to about 20%, decaying exponentially with a half-life of 200 \nrounds, adaptive learning is rapid in four-player groups; but with initial noise above about 30%, \nnegligible improvement is evident even after 200 rounds. \nWe therefore suggest that human decision makers approach MSS decision tasks using a \nWSLS decision rule, starting with something like 20% misimplementation noise after rewarding \nrounds and 50% after unrewarding rounds. What we call \u2015noise\u2016 may, of course, include myriad \nidiosyncratic hypotheses, of which we are ignorant, that players formulate and try to test through \nexploratory decisions, the number of false hypotheses increasing when the players know that \nthey are involved in interactive games. The result is very different from what would occur under \nthe decision rule that we conjectured before performing our experiments, namely Optimistic \nPavlov, in which misimplementation noise follows unrewarding rounds only. Under that rule, \nadaptive learning should theoretically occur remarkably quickly and easily in MSS groups of all \nsizes, even with very noisy responses following unrewarding rounds. \nThe implications of our findings for everyday social, economic, and political life are clear. \nWhereas dyads, such as married couples or business partners, may be able to rely to a certain \nextent on coordination without explicit communication, larger groups simply cannot. Reverting \nto our dyadic example in the introduction of Alf and Beth choosing snacks for their children, if \nthey followed the noisy WSLS rule that our experimental participants evidently followed, \nassuming vaguely that their snack choices might be making their own children ill from time to \ntime, then each would eventually learn to reward the other by avoiding the snack that, in reality, \nmakes the other child ill. However, this remarkable social mechanism would not work in larger \ngroups of snack-sharing children although, if the parents discussed their children\u2019s allergies, they \nmight gain insight into the game. More generally, tacit coordination can evolve in dyads, but \nlarger groups can hope to coordinate their actions only by explicit communication and planning. \nIf successful cooperation is to be achieved in larger groups or organizations, then mechanisms \nneed to be put in place to facilitate the coordination of members\u2019 actions and expectations of one \nanother\u2019s actions. \nIn conjunction with our experimental results, our Monte Carlo simulations solve the problem \nof providing a coherent explanation of how human decision makers behave in MSS games. As in \nalmost all domains, behavior tends to follow the law of effect. However, in the MSS, players \nbegin by implementing the WSLS decision rule, mandated by the law of effect, rather noisily, \nfrequently deviating from it after rewarding rounds and more frequently after unrewarding \nrounds, but gradually implementing it more rigorously over successive rounds. This would \nexplain not only our own results but also those of previous investigators. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis project was supported by Grant No. LRG-37265 awarded by the British Academy \nLarger Research Grants Scheme to Andrew M.

Exponential \nsmoothing is a method of estimating the maximum likelihood value of a general parameter \u03b1, \nranging from \u03b1 = 0 when previous values are weighted as heavily as recent ones in fitting the \nmodel to \u03b1 = 1 when the single most recent value is used exclusively; a parameter \u03b3 indicating \nthe degree of trend, not necessarily linear; a seasonality parameter \u03b4; and a damping parameter \u03c6, \nwhen a series shows trend that tends to die out. ARIMA (p, d, q) modeling estimates the \nmaximum likelihood values of the p and q parameters, analogous to beta coefficients in multiple \nregression, and the degree of differencing involved in fitting the model to the time series. The \nvalue of p indicates the number of autoregression parameters, d the degree of differencing, \nindicative of linear or nonlinear trend, and q the number of moving average parameters. \n \nExperiment 1 \nCurve estimation. For two-player groups, linear and quadratic curve estimation produced a \nleast-squares linear model with R2 = .18 and standardized regression coefficient \u03b2 = .42, F(1, \n198) = 42.30, p < 001, indicating a significant linear increase in cooperative choices over the 200 \nrounds of the experiment. The least-squares quadratic model yielded R2 = .18, with standardized \nregression coefficients \u03b2 (linear) = .40 and \u03b2 (quadratic) = .02, F(2, 197) = 21.05, p < .001. The \namount of incremental variance explained by the quadratic component over and above the linear \ncomponent is zero, so the curvilinear trend can be disregarded. For three-player groups, R2 \n(linear) = .00 and R2 (quadratic) = .00, confirming the absence of any significant trend in \ncooperative choices over rounds. For four-player groups, R2 (linear) = .00, R2 (quadratic) = .01, \nand the incremental variance explained by the quadratic trend is nonsignificant, F(2, 197) = 1.98, \nns, hence failing to provide evidence of any significant trend. For six-player groups, R2 (linear) = \n.01, R2 (quadratic) = .02, and the incremental variance explained by the quadratic trend is \nnonsignificant, F( 2, 197) = 1.60, ns, failing once again to detect any significant trend. The \nresults of curve estimation therefore confirm the impression conveyed by Fig. 3 that it was only \nin the two-player groups that cooperation increased significantly over rounds. \nExponential smoothing. For two-player groups, a grid search showed that the smoothing \nparameters having the smallest sum of squared errors were \u03b1 = .1 and \u03b3 = 0. The autocorrelation \nfunction (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) of the residuals from the smoothed \nseries\u2014after smoothing with these parameters\u2014are within the upper and lower 95% confidence \nlimits for all lags up to 16, confirming that the residuals are white noise, as required for a \nsatisfactory model fit. For three-player, four-player, and six-player groups, exponential \nsmoothing yielded stationary smoothed series, suggesting that the original time series lacked any \nMinimal Social Situations  28  \n \n \nstatistically significant structure. The original time series and exponential smoothing model fits \nfor all group sizes are displayed in Fig. 4. \nARIMA model identification, estimation, and diagnosis. The Box-Jenkins procedure was used \nto identify and estimate an autoregressive integrated moving average or ARIMA (p, d, q) model \nfor each group size. For two-player groups, analysis of the ACF and PACF plots of the original \nseries, in conjunction with the associated Box-Ljung statistics, suggested an ARIMA (0, 1, 1) \nmodel, with differencing at lag 1 to produce stationarity. The moving average parameter q was \nmarginally significant (t = 1.79, p = .07) suggesting that the two-player data were generated by a \nprocess in which the proportion of cooperative choices increased gradually over the 200 rounds \nof the game, and that the score on each round was determined marginally by a random \ndisturbance on the immediately preceding round. For three-player, four-player, and six-player \ngroups, ARIMA (0, 1, 0) models were derived, suggesting that the time series from these groups \nwere random walks, without significant autoregressive or moving average parameters. For \ndiagnosis, the ACF and PACF plots of the residual (error) series were analyzed, confirming \nabsence of significant structure in the residuals after model fitting for all group sizes. \n \nExperiment 2 \nCurve estimation. For two-player groups, curve estimation yielded a nonsignificant overall \neffect: F(3, 27) = 1.24, ns; similarly for three-player groups, F(3, 42) = 0.71, ns and four-player \ngroups, F(3, 57) = 1.45, ns. On the basis of curve estimation, there is no evidence of significant \ntrend for any of the group sizes. \nExponential smoothing. For two-player groups, a grid search yielded smoothing parameters \nof \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b3 = 0 having the smallest sum of squared errors, with ACF and PACF plots of \nresiduals within the upper and lower 95% confidence limits for all but one of the lags up to 16, \nand an inspection of the sequence plot revealed no hint of structure. Essentially the same result \nemerged for three-player and four-player groups. \nARIMA model identification, estimation, and diagnosis. ACF and PACF plots of the original \nseries, in conjunction with the associated Box-Ljung statistics, suggested that all three time series \nwere best represented by an ARIMA (0, 1, 0) random walk, and this was confirmed by \ninspection of the ACF and PACF plots of the residuals after fitting these models. \n \nExperiment 3 \nCurve estimation. A sequence graph of the two-player data showed evidence of trend, hence \nlinear and quadratic curve estimation were performed. The least-squares linear model yielded R2 \n= .32, standardized regression coefficient \u03b2 = .56, F(1, 48) = 22.28, p < 001, indicating a \nsignificant linear increase in cooperative choices over the 50 rounds of the experiment. The least-\nsquares quadratic model yielded R2 = .18, with little incremental variance explained by the \nquadratic component over and above the linear component. For three-player groups, R2 (linear) = \n.17 and R2 (quadratic) = .39, F(2, 47) = 14.75, p < .001. For four-player groups, R2 (linear) = .02 \nand R2 (quadratic) = .03, with standardized regression coefficients \u03b2 = 0.00 (linear) and \u03b2 = .16 \n(quadratic), F(2, 47) = 0.50, ns, and there is no evidence of any significant trend in cooperative \nchoices over rounds. Curve estimation suggests, therefore, that it was only in the two-player and \nthree-player groups that cooperation increased significantly over rounds. \nExponential smoothing. For two-player groups, a grid search revealed the parameters \nminimizing the sum of squared errors to be \u03b1 = .1 and \u03b3 = 0, with ACF and PACF plots of the \nresiduals from the smoothed series lying within the upper and lower 95% confidence limits for \nMinimal Social Situations  29  \n \n \nalmost all lags up to 16. For three-player groups, the smoothing parameters were \u03b1 = .3 and \u03b3 = \n0, and for four-player groups the smoothed series was stationary. \nARIMA model identification, estimation, and diagnosis. Analysis of the ACF and PACF plots \nand Box-Ljung statistics suggested, for two-player and three-player groups, ARIMA (1, 1, 0) \nmodels, with differencing at lag 1 to produce stationarity. For both group sizes, the \nautoregressive parameters were significant (t = 2.18, p = .03 for two-player groups; t = 3.57, p < \n.01 for three-player groups). These results suggest that, in both two-player and three-player \ngroups, the proportions of cooperative choices increased over the 50 rounds of the experiment, \nand that the outcome on each round was influenced by the outcome on the immediately \npreceding round, although in three-player groups, the significant increase in cooperative choices \nappears to have occurred mainly from the fourth to the fifth and final trial block. For four-player \ngroups, no significant autoregressive or moving average parameters were found, hence the time \nseries is best described as an ARIMA (0, 1, 0) random walk. \n \nExperiment 4 \nExponential smoothing. For three-player groups, a sequence graph suggested the possibility \nof a weak trend over the 50 rounds of the experiment. However, an exponential smoothing grid \nsearch yielded a best-fitting model with only one parameter, \u03b1 = .2, and ACF and PACF plots of \nthe residuals from the smoothed series were within the upper and lower 95% confidence limits \nfor all lags up to 16. This suggests that outcomes in three-player groups were slightly influenced \nby outcomes on previous rounds but that no significant trend was present in the time series. \nFor four-player groups, a sequence graph showed no suggestion of any pattern in the data. \nExponential smoothing yielded a best-fitting model with \u03b1 = 0 and ACF and PACF plots of the \nresiduals from the smoothed series within the upper and lower 95% confidence limits for all lags \nup to 16, confirming an absence of any meaningful pattern in the time-series. \nARIMA model identification, estimation, and diagnosis. For three-player and four-player \ngroups, analysis of ACF and PACF plots and Box-Ljung statistics of the original time series \nyielded nothing suggestive of any significant effects, in spite of the slight increase in cooperation \nin three-player groups in the second half of the series. Both series are best modeled by ARIMA \n(0, 1, 0) random walks. \n \nReferences \nArickx, M., & Van Avermaet, E. (1981). Interdependent learning in a minimal social situation.
