In the present paper I try to secure\nmore firmly a novel understanding of why analogy is an essential component in the attempt to justify\nmoral beliefs. I seek to show how analogical argument both encapsulates and exercises the notions of\nrationality and imagination and that the construction, development, and comparison of analogies fun-\ndamentally underpins ethical argument. In so doing, it enables us to adopt imaginative and ethically\nilluminating perspectives but in a manner that does not relinquish any claims to intellectual rigour. I\npresent a critique of a brand of \u201cmoral particularism\u201d by showing how it cannot, if construed in a cer-\ntain way, adequately conceive of how we use analogies and imaginary cases in ethics. Although such\na particularism is thus impotent with regard to ethical debate, I show that the wider motivation behind\nparticularism that can be extracted is of clear relevance and importance to medical practitioners.\nThis paper is a development of themes addressed in arecent article in the Journal of Medical Ethics.1 In it EricWiland seeks both to contribute to the ongoing debate\nconcerning the moral status of abortion, and also to raise\nawareness of the significance of analogy in moral argument.\nMy concern in the present article will be primarily guided by\nthis second aspect, although I hope that implications that are\nmore directly relevant to themoral status of abortion will stem\nfrom these considerations. I will argue that the procedure of\nanalogical reasoning is essentially linked to our inquiries into\nethical issues both in a theoretical way and also with regard to\nconcrete cases of the day-to-day demands and requirements of\nmoral reflection, judgment, and argument. I claim that the\nconstruction, development, and comparison of analogies\nunderpin the manner in which we enter into ethical debate\nand\u2014reminding us that theoretical or \u201cphilosophical\u201d ethics\nremains inalienably attached to its more normative\napplications\u2014\u201care the stuff out of which normative moral\nphilosophy is made\u201d.2\nI wish to consider the rise of contemporary \u201cmoral particu-\nlarism\u201d with reference to the procedures of analogical reason-\ning, and to the status and role of imaginary cases in ethics.My\naim will be to urge practitioners to recognise the importance\nof analogy and the imaginary case when applied to ethical\ndeliberation; however, in so doing, I aim also to secure the\nbelief that in approaching moral issues and moral argument\nfrom an analogical and \u201cimaginative\u201d point of view,we are not\nrelinquishing any claim to intellectual rigour.\nIn the second section I outline the manner in which moral\nparticularism emphasises the importance of the particular\ncase in ethical deliberation, and also explain why it is hostile\nto the use of imaginary cases in ethics. The third section\nexamines the status of analogy in moral argument, and\nsecures the belief that analogies with or without imaginary\nelements help nurture ourmoral sensitivities. The final section\nbrings together the reasons why analogical argument man-\nages to successfully unite our \u201cimaginative\u201d capacities with an\nadherence to the canons of rationality.\nMoral particularism is an influential movement in contem-\nporary moral philosophy, that largely can be characterised as a\nreaction against the previous dominance and apparently\nbloated influence of the role of principles in moral thinking. If\nwe understood moral particularism as a mere rejection of\nprinciples, then it could rightly be considered as radical in the\nextreme. What motivates particularism, however, is rather a\nhostility to the manner in which agents tend to deliberate\nabout a particular moral case as though it must be considered\nalways and only with reference to a relevant principle. For\nexample, we know that a person was, is or will be wrong to lie\nbecause of our adherence to the moral principle that it is\n\u201calways wrong to lie\u201d. The moral particularist complains that\nthis \u201cintellectual\u201d way of reaching a moral conclusion can\nserve to obscure the potential complexity of the particular case.\nThus, it may be a morally relevant consideration to take into\naccount that the particular lie in question may be addressed to\nthe sort of people who are easily offended by others not liking\ntheir new hairstyles. This particular sort of sensitivity on the\npart of this person may function as a reason in this instance to\nlie about whether or not one has a liking for the new hairdo.\nOn other occasions, with different people, in different\ncontexts, the moral features of a case may function differently.\nThe particularist complaint is that seeking to justify a moral\njudgment by appeal to abstract and general principles will\npotentially miss the important aspects that pertain to a given,\nparticular, moral state of affairs. The moral particularist\ncontinues that considerable moral harm can be brought about\nby the following of abstract principles that do not and cannot\ntake into account the peculiarities of any individual moral cir-\ncumstance.\nOne prominent moral particularist, Jonathan Dancy,3 urges\nus to inspect each moral circumstance on its own merit, and\nformulate our judgment on the basis of what each case will\ndemand without looking to principles, or how we have judged\non \u201csimilar\u201d occasions in the past:\none\u2019s main duty, in moral judgement, is to look really\nclosely at the case before one. Our first question is not\n\u201cWhich other cases does this one best resemble?\u201d, but\nrather \u201cWhat is the nature of the case before us?\u201d4\nMoral particularism can be understood as propounding a\n\u201ccase-by-case\u201d methodology in dealing with moral questions,\nand there is thus a sense in which particularism could be\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCorrespondence to:\nMr B Smith, Department of\nPhilosophy, University of\nWarwick, Coventry,\nCV4 7AL, England;\nB.W.Smith@warwick.ac.uk\nRevised version received\n7 January 2002\nAccepted for publication\n13 February 2002\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n244\nwww.jmedethics.com\n on 5 November 2009 jme.bmj.comDownloaded from \nregarded as an appropriate method by which to approach\nextremely complex or perhaps unprecedented ethical cases. To\nregard it thus, however, immediately gives rise to at least two\nsignificant difficulties. On the one hand, to consider it as any\nmethod at all would be a misunderstanding; moral particular-\nism can only urge us to avoid the inappropriate conceptual\nand logical impositions that have been placed upon ethical\nthinking by the previous dominance of moral systems. Moral\nparticularism says to us that we ought to look really carefully\nat the case at hand, be sensitive to the complex and peculiar\ncharacteristics that make up the situation, and not artificially\nsituate a given case in the light of other cases. I assume that so\nconstrued, these warnings would be considered welcome by\nmost. However, the notion that particularism is able to offer\nanything beyond such cautionary constraints is methodologi-\ncally unintelligible; for particularism to describe\u2014positively\u2014\nthe method by which we ought to approach a moral case\nwould mean it behaves in just that way that it considers\nwrong. The second difficulty that immediately presents itself,\nand linked to the first, is that over the alleged status of moral\ncases as \u201cisolated\u201d. Particularism complains that the \u201cmoral\nshape\u201d of a certain state of affairs cannot be predicted from\nhow other moral shapes have been produced in the past, and\nso each case ought to be treated as if it were \u201cisolated\u201d. The\nlack of precedent cannot be amended for, according to the\nparticularist, by judging a certain way about the case in a\nmanner \u201clogically consistent\u201d with other putatively similar\ncases; to do so would, I presume, employ a decision procedure\nabout a moral case that is based upon purely non-moral\nconsiderations\u2014those concerned with the mere preservation\nof \u201clogical consistency\u201d\u2014for example. The moral particularist\nis hostile to the deployment of moral principles that are con-\ntext unfriendly; principles whose abstraction and generalis-\nability subsume moral cases regardless of the peculiarities of a\ngiven case. However, this appears as rather implausible to the\nextent that it is just a fact about our moral practice that we do\ncompare and contrast cases.\nAn example of an abstract principle could be one embodied\nin the Hippocratic tradition; \u201cpreserve human life\u201d, say. The\nparticularist might be sceptical as to the moral efficacy of such\na principle because it can come to be employed purely in a\nquantitative fashion (relating to the length of life), and to the\nexclusion or wilful ignorance of the peculiar qualities that per-\ntain to individual cases. The particularist will urge a medical\npractitioner to firstly consider a case with reference to its con-\ntext, seeking to extract the moral saliences that are produced\nby the elements giving rise to that circumstance, and not\nbecause it falls under a certain principle. Thus the medical\npractitioner ought to reflect on how, say, the \u201cpreservation of\nhuman life\u201d relates to the other features of a given\ncase\u2014familial wishes and expectations, or the comparison of\nthe patient\u2019s \u201chuman life\u201d with the \u201chuman life\u201d of their\nspouse\u2014for example. Such qualities of a case will only be\nproperly understood, according to the particularist, from the\ncontextual point of view.Although decisionsmay indeed come\nto be totally in accord with an abstract principle, this, if the\nmedical practitioner heeds the particularist\u2019s strictures, will\nnot be because one has viewed the individual case from the\npoint of view of the principle, but instead that that particular\ncase, after appropriate analysis, demanded a certain decision\nin virtue and not in spite of its particular context and special\nfeatures.\nParticularism is broadly attractive in its call for the detailed\ninspections and close analyses of the demands of each moral\ncase. I am sceptical, however, of the search to justify this\nthrough a notion of the \u201cmorally isolated\u201d case, or on the basis\nthat we ought not to attempt to predict the moral shape of this\ncase from the behaviour of the moral shape of cases\n\u201celsewhere\u201d. In approaching the issues that emerge here, I\nwish to draw upon an article by Jonathan Dancy5 in which he\nargues that the role of the imaginary case in ethical delibera-\ntion should be considered as limited in the extreme. Dancy\nclaims that in constructing an imaginary case, we hope that it\nwill be able to supplement our moral deliberation about an\nactual case; deliberation that is lacking in some way or unable\nto provide the appropriate resources for judgment or action.\nUsually this procedure is undertaken because the actual case\nis morally difficult, whereas the imaginary case more easily\nlends itself to a clear cut ethical decision. Dancy maintains,\nhowever, that if the imaginary case is to fulfil its role as ethi-\ncal guide, then we must know in what particular ways it will\ndo so, and this knowledge presupposes other knowledge con-\ncerning the actual case:\nEssentially, we have to make up our minds about the\nmoral make up of the actual case before we can come to\na view about whether the imaginary case is after all a\nreliable guide.6\nThe point here is that the imaginary case, if it is to function\nin the way intended, must depend upon our knowledge of the\nactual case; however, this knowledge is precisely that which\nthe imaginary case is constructed to provide. Dancy thus\nconsiders imaginary cases in ethics not to be ethically illumi-\nnating or morally educating. It appears as though a certain\nmoral particularism would also reject the examination of\nanalogies, on the grounds that the proposed analogy may well\ninvolve \u201cimaginary\u201d elements and, more fundamentally, that\nany comparison between moral cases (imaginary or no) is\nalready misdirected. I disagree, and would want to argue that\nanalogies and imaginary cases in ethics are not only useful but\nin fact required by moral deliberation, although an appropri-\nately rich account of this \u201crequirement\u201d is considerably\nbeyond the scope of the present article.\nWiland chooses to examine Judith Thomson\u2019s7 well known\nand controversial analogy that attempts to draw a morally rel-\nevant comparison between abortion and an imaginary case\ninvolving an unconscious violinist. For those unfamiliar with\nthis example I, with some risk of oversimplification, para-\nphrase the relevant section from Thomson\u2019s article:\nYou find yourself to be biologically attached to a famous\nviolinist who is unconscious. He has a fatal kidney condition\nand only you have the correct sort of blood type to help. A\ngroup of dedicated music lovers have kidnapped you and\nwired-up the violinist\u2019s circulatory system to your own in\norder for his blood to be cleansed by your kidneys. A hospital\ndirector explains that although they would have taken meas-\nures to prevent the music lovers from doing this, if they had\nknown, the fact of the matter is that you are so wired-up. The\ndirector further explains that to break the connection between\nyou and the violinist would be kill him. Further, the period of\nattachment to the violinist will be only for nine months, after\nwhich he should have recovered and both you and he can be\nsafely separated. All person\u2019s have a right to life (including\nunconscious violinists), and although you have right to deter-\nmine what occurs in and to your own body, this right is\ntrumped by a (any) person\u2019s more basic right to life. Thus, you\nare morally obligated to resist separation and remain attached\nto the violinist so as not to violate his right to life.\nFrom the contemplation of this case, Thomson aims to\nextract a certain problematic moral conclusion: that it is mor-\nally required that you assent to an \u201coutrageous\u201d situation.8 The\npurpose of the analogy is to demonstrate why the same\noutrage is also applicable to a certain attitude toward abortion;\nnamely, that abortion is always wrong. In proposing this anal-\nogy, Thomson implicitly seeks explanations from those who\nresist drawing the same conclusion about two cases that are,\nethically speaking, relevantly similar; and it is just such expla-\nnations that have been offered by critics of Thomson\u2019s analogy.\nThese objections attempt to show why the analogy is weak,\nand that there are morally relevant dis-analogies between the\nAnalogy in moral deliberation: the role of imagination and theory in ethics 245\nwww.jmedethics.com\n on 5 November 2009 jme.bmj.comDownloaded from \ntwo cases, and so there would be no reason to suppose that the\nsame moral outrage should apply equally in each case. Thom-\nson presents a certain picture of moral deliberation that\ninvolves the comparison of moral cases and, through the pres-\nentation of a morally relevant analogy, challenges proposals to\njudge differently when confronted with relevantly similar\nsituations. That is to say, Thomson implies that nothing but\narbitrary decision will motivate our judging about the cases if\nwe accept that the analogy is a good one. Of course\u2014as critics\nhave suggested\u2014the analogy may not be a good one, in which\ncase Thomson\u2019s proposal would be less than persuasive. For\nour purposes, I do not want to rehearse the main objections to\nThomson\u2019s analogy and attempt to construct a better one, if\nindeed one is needed. Rather, I aim to emphasise the manner\nin which moral particularism cannot accept the analogy for\nthe simple reason that it is an analogy. I suggest that debating\nwhether or not Thomson\u2019s analogy is in fact a good one, is an\nexample of what constitutes one of the most fundamentally\nimportant practices in moral deliberation. Because moral par-\nticularism cannot properly recognise the activity of comparing\nmoral circumstances and hence rejects the efficacy of\nimaginary cases in ethics, it appears to be unable even to enter\ninto this debate; for this reason I find it to be a severely impo-\ntent and unattractive position.\nWiland9 states that although Thomson\u2019s analogy may\ncontain flaws, we ought to keep in mind what she was trying\nto do via the suggestion that there may be a morally relevant\nanalogy between the case of the unconscious violinist and\nabortion. I suggest that analogies can help us to adopt an\nethically illuminating perspective which had previously\nremained unoccupied. We can appreciate, via the construction\nand analysis of analogy, a novel way to consider an object case.\nA natural response to this suggestion may be motivated by it\nnot seeming to be at all clear what happens after a good anal-\nogy has been drawn;why does or ought it to matter if one case\nis or is not analogous to another? It matters because in draw-\ning analogies (and for that matter dis-analogies) we come to\nknow something about that object case over and above its\nexistence as an allegedly isolated occurrence; that is, we see\nhow it relates to other cases and in a way that makes it irrel-\nevant whether such cases \u201cactually exist\u201d. This is not to say\nthat this process is undertaken in order to serve as a scan for\nlogical inconsistency; if it were merely to do this, then the\nparticularists would be right to be sceptical of the role of\nanalogies and imaginary cases in ethics. It is rather, I suggest,\nto serve in an ethical capacity itself\u2014beyond or at least along-\nside the \u201cpurely logical\u201d. The very act of constructing\nanalogies and their subsequent contemplation, helps mini-\nmise our limitations as moral beings and Wiland rightly\nclaims that the:\nwhole point of using analogies in moral philosophy is ...\nto get us past our self interest, inertia, lack of empathy,\nlack of imagination and defensiveness.10\nIt is this \u201cgetting past\u201d or transcending morally dubious\nmotivations in ethical deliberation that can be achieved by\nadopting a different point of view from one\u2019s own. This will\nrequire some imaginative capacity on the part of the agent,\nand can occur through the positioning of oneself in the place\nof another. However, this repositioning can also take place\nthrough the drawing of analogies between the object case and\nother situations. In Thomson\u2019s analogy for instance, previously\nunnoticed or obscured moral features of abortion are\npotentially clarified or made explicit by the comparison with\nanother state of affairs; conclusions drawn from that case\ninvolving the unconscious violinist are directly transposable to\nthe wider case of abortion. Of course, the extent of this \u201cdirect\ntransposition\u201d is the moot point.\nOne \u201cdefect\u201d of Thomson\u2019s analogy, Wiland notes, is that\nthe case of the violinist is utterly fictitious. The form of this\nobjection is a common reaction to some notoriously fantasti-\ncal examples found within the literature of moral philosophy.\nSuch examples can themselves be offensive when they are\ninvoked in order to apparently help us deliberate about an\nactual and difficult moral case. In an influential article, G E M\nAnscombe11 notes how such \u201cfictitious\u201d moral cases are\ntypically manufactured with an eye to moral corruption.What\nthey attempt, however, although with varying degrees of suc-\ncess, is to pose the form of the actual moral case in a way that\nenables us to adopt a different perspective upon it; it is hoped\nthat this different perspective will throw moral light upon the\nactual case. In order to achieve this, there must be some kind\nof common ground uponwhich both the actual and imaginary\ncase converge. When there is little or no such ground, the\nanalogy is weak or there is no analogy at all. When this com-\nmon ground is extensive, however, it may be so in a morally\npedagogical way. It is the existence of such common ground or\n\u201cconceptual convergence\u201d that gives rise to my rejection of the\n\u201cmorally isolated\u201d. Whilst not suggesting that moral cases,\nquestions, and dilemmas fall into predetermined kinds I do\nwant to say that moral states of affairs contain, in a certain\nway, implications for other ones. This is to say, that moral cases\nhave something in common. Although this commonality may\nindeed be extremely formal and schematic, it is what in part\nallows for their recognition as moral cases at all. The point of\nThomson\u2019s violinist example is thus to try and get us to recog-\nnise the circumstance as holding a certain moral import; to\nstimulate our ethical thinking through the acknowledgement\nthat the violinist\u2019s circumstance can inform our ethical\nthought about abortion through recognising the moral force\nof the implications drawn from the former.\nEven when analogies are held to be weak or irrelevant, this\nmay itself serve an important ethical function. In seeking to\ndefeat an analogy, by bringing out the dissimilarities between\ntwo cases, we can help foster moral wisdom by being more\ninformed,morally speaking. Thus, to be in a position to declare\na proposed analogy as weak (or non-existent) presupposes a\ncertain amount of knowledge concerning that which the\nanalogous item is weak with regard to. For a person to give\nreasons why, for instance, Thomson\u2019s analogy is too fragile is\nto affirm certain characteristic moral features of abortion; for\nexample that, according to such a person, a fetus is in a state\nbrought about by a voluntary action of the mother, and thus\ncrucially unlike the state of affairs in Thomson\u2019s example.\nMoral knowledge is gained however, when we are brought to\nsee in what ways and to what extent a proposed analogy is a\ngood or a bad one. In being brought to see these things,we can\nrecognise certain moral relevances that were there anyway, but\nwere obscured or ignored by our short-sightedness or lack of\nimagination. So, Thomson\u2019s analogy may (or may not) help us\nto supplement our moral sensitivities by enabling us to see\nmore clearly the ethical status of abortion by bringing out\nperhaps previously latent features, such as the moral status of\nthe unwilled existence of some biological appendage to one\u2019s\nbody. It is incumbent upon us as moral beings to debate and\nanalyse proposed analogies and to construct new ones, to\ncompare them with old ones, and to develop an appropriately\nsophisticated understanding of moral cases, which reflects the\noften difficult and controversial character of many moral\nissues.\nMoral particularism, as an ethical project that seeks to\ndeflate the apparent but unjustifiable force of principles in\nmoral deliberation, can be given direct application to medical\npractice. The relationship held between, say, doctor and\npatient is widely thought to be an essential component of\nmuch proper, effective, and lasting treatment, and this aspect\nof medical practice can\u2014and perhaps ought\u2014to be given a\nparticularistic understanding. For instance, the balance\nbetween the obligation of medical practitioners to tell the\ntruth to their patients and exercising compassion toward\nthem can perhaps only be optimally achieved via the adoption\n246 Smith\nwww.jmedethics.com\n on 5 November 2009 jme.bmj.comDownloaded from \nof a particularist approach. Rather than deliberate about a case\nonly with regard to it being one among many similar cases\nthat are similar because they fall under some principle, the\nparticularist will urge that detailed analyses must in the first\ninstance be carried out so that this patient, and those other\npersons significantly involved, can benefit to the maximum\ndegree. This might, for instance, involve a medical practitioner\nadvising a particular patient by calling on knowledge gained\nfrom a particularistic analysis\u2014knowing that this patient\nwould benefit from certain information that would not be\nappropriately given to other putatively \u201csimilar\u201d patients, or\nknowing that this patient\u2019s family arrangements need to be\naddressed in a way that differs from other patients. Such\nknowledge, so the particularist would argue, can only be\ngleaned from a detailed inspection of the particular circum-\nstances at hand and, as such, is in important ways different\nfrom knowledge had from the mere situating of this case in\nthe light of a principle.\nWhat would make for an appropriately sensitive moral\nagent is the possession of certain theoretical capacities along-\nside and interdependent with a particular sort of imaginative\nsubtlety. This would allow the construction of analogies whilst\nsimultaneously allowing for their critical scrutiny and\ncritique. To know something is a good analogy, takes theoreti-\ncal and logical skill; further, we can determine to some\nextent\u2014in a factual way\u2014the level of relevant similarity\nbetween items. However, the very construction of analogy\nrelies on imaginative expertise. Crucially all these elements\nare in a significant way mutually dependent upon one\nanother.\nThis paper is a call for a certain humility in moral thinking;\nhumility in the sense that we must recognise that our imagi-\nnations are limited\u2014in some of us, disastrously so. Recognis-\ning this will facilitate dialogue and argument to the extent\nthat it raises awareness of the potential for novel and critical\nanalogies, that in turn require examination and defence. The\nanalogies we construct will lead to new and better\u2014as well as\nworse\u2014ones, thus helping to generate ongoing ethical discus-\nsion. Wiland\u2019s12 development of Thomson\u2019s analogy involving\nconjoined twins is an example of this. Readers will be aware of\nthe relevance and poignancy of this analogy given recent\nevents in the UK.13\nThere will always be new analogies to be drawn, and we\nmust enable our moral beliefs to be examined and criticised by\nallowing them to be compared and contrasted with alterna-\ntives. Only by having a rich moral imagination, along with the\ncapability to discern similarities and differences between\ncases, will we be able to face the difficult moral states of affairs\nwith which we will always be presented. This paper is implic-\nitly concerned with the justification of moral beliefs. The role\nof imagination and analogy combined with rational critique\nprovides scope for the evaluation of such justification. Moral\nparticularism ought to be taken seriously for drawing our\nattention toward the potentially myopic tendencies of abstract\ntheorising and the purely \u201cintellectual\u201d approach to ethical\ncases. However, we need to supplement particularism so as to\nmake it flexible enough to accommodate the procedures of\nanalogical reasoning, and the ability to compare and learn\nfrom different moral cases, imaginary or otherwise.\nWhat I hope to have shown here is that whilst particular-\nism\u2019s critique of the project of \u201cintellectualising\u201d moral cases\nis well placed, we must be sceptical of it if the cost of this cri-\ntique can only be met by the total rejection of an analogy as\nanalogy. Of course, if particularism helps us to discern the\nrelative strengths and weaknesses of proposed analogies then\nall to the good. However, what isn\u2019t so good is if any analogy is\ndeemed inappropriate in virtue of its attempt to compare\ncases\u2014actual or otherwise. This paper is not an attempt\nmerely to suggest that analogous cases are useful in ethical\ndeliberation. It is also claiming that the role of analogy\nconstruction and evaluation is itself ethically pedagogical\nbecause it embodies a certain comparative activity; the sort of\nactivity that can help produce more sensitive and subtle moral\nunderstanding.\nDeliberation using analogy encapsulates the more attractive\naspects both of particularism and of that which it is reacting\nagainst. Formal similarities are crucial in determining\nwhether or not a given analogy is strong; for instance, the\nunconscious violinist is arguably like a fetus in respect of its\napparent position of \u201cdependence\u201d. But the substantial quali-\nties that pertain to the items drawn together in an analogy can\nalso be decisive: that a fetus and ex hypothesi the unconscious\nviolinist will die if separated from the mother or from \u201cyou\u201d.\nAn analogy is a bad one when the similarities said to obtain\nbetween cases are irrelevant in that they bear little or no rela-\ntion to the object of deliberation: that two patients are \u201ciden-\ntical\u201d in respect of voting for the same party in the last general\nelection is irrelevant from a diagnostic point of view. Crucially,\nthe manner in which elements will combine and produce an\nanalogy of a certain strength cannot be predicted a priori, or\nestablished by the following of abstract rules or the position-\ning of a particular case with reference to a principle. What is\nneeded in order to achieve the appropriate construction and\nevaluation of an analogy is a certain skill on the part of an\nagent; a certain insight that comes only with the practice of\nengaging in such thinking and \u201clooking\u201d, to use the particu-\nlarist\u2019s terminology.\nParticularism seems appropriate for application to medical\npractice in the way that it puts forward a case for sensitive and\ndetailed examinations of the complex and varied nature of\nthose features which produce a given case. We have seen,\nhowever, that if particularism is understood in too simple a\nway, claiming that the analysis of a medical case must operate\nalways and only with reference to this case and no other, then\nthe very procedure of drawing an analogy is denied. I suggest\nthat on the one hand medical practitioners ought to acknowl-\nedge the particularist\u2019s warnings that the mechanistic follow-\ning of abstract principles and rules to the exclusion of the per-\nhaps unprecedented demands of a given case can lead to\nmoral harm; on the other hand, there ought to be a serious\nattempt to think of cases analogically so that we may gain a\nmore ethically rounded understanding. This exercise is a com-\nparative activity that itself is morally informative. Whether or\nnot Thomson\u2019s analogy is \u201cgood\u201d merely from a logical point\nof view, it succeeds in nurturing ethical debate in so far as it\npresents a different way of understanding the moral stakes of\nabortion. For many other medical cases, seeking to compare\nthem with other ones, reflecting in light of their similarities\nand differences and tracing the moral implications will serve\nto inform our moral thought. So, particularism helps us to\ninvestigate the nature of certain medical and ethical cases by\nstressing the role of a certain sensitivity; a sensitivity that does\nnot originate in the mere following of abstract theory, rules or\nprinciples. However, the manner in which moral knowledge\ncan be delivered by comparative analysis, that form of analysis\nembodied in analogical reasoning, should make us wary of the\nprospects of any \u201cbald\u201d particularism.\nAt the very least, we ought to have at least two minimum\nexpectations: We should want an arena for ethical debate and\nargument that is strict and rigorous; the rational and logical\nconstraints placed upon analogies satisfies this expectation.\nWe should also want a state of affairs where nothing\npotentially relevant is excluded frommoral debate a priori; the\nsometimes extraordinarily complex nature of moral cases\nmeans that we will have to approach them with respect to\ntheir own peculiar demands, although we bring to them our\ncapacity as intelligent and creative creatures; the scope of\npotential analogies that can yield considerable moral insight\nand foster ethical sensitivity satisfies this expectation. This\narticle has attempted to focus attention on the important and\nintertwining roles that both logic or rationality and imagina-\ntion have to play in ethical deliberation; roles that are encap-\nsulated and exercised within the form of analogical argument.\nAnalogy in moral deliberation: the role of imagination and theory in ethics 247\nwww.jmedethics.com\n on 5 November 2009 jme.bmj.comDownloaded from \nWe ought to recognise the significant attractions that\nanalogies have for ethical debate, and become the sort of\nmoral beings that can balance our creative imaginations with\nthe recognition that analogies can be both clarified and made\nmore powerful by situating themwithin a rational framework.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nI wish to thank Martin Warner, Dan Higman, and two anonymous\nreferees for helpful comments on an earlier draft.\nREFERENCES AND NOTES\n1 Wiland E.
