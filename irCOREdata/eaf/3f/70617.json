The many connections between the\nsystem\u2019s components enable efficient regulation of\nblood flow through a closed system of vessels.\nHow do we approach the understanding of this complex sys-\ntem? Basically, there are two ways: a microscopic and a macro-\nscopic approach. In the microscopic approach, one tries to\nanalyze the function of each part of the system in great detail. The\nmacroscopic approach, on the other hand, is interested in the col-\nlective behavior of all parts. Both approaches are necessary to gain\na complete understanding, and the problem is where to start.\nMicroscopic analysis of large complex systems inevitably results\nin a large system of differential equations. However, there are\ncases when a system that looks very complicated on the micro-\nscopic level exhibits rather simple macroscopic behavior [1], [2].\nWe show that the CVS is an example of such system. In the\nnext section, we introduce the coupled nonlinear oscillators\napproach, the framework that we use for our studies of cardiovas-\ncular and brain oscillations. As background, we describe the\nhuman CVS and present results of time-frequency analysis using\nwavelet transforms of several noninvasive measurements of car-\ndiovascular signals. Studies of neuronal oscillations have been\nundertaken since the first human electroencephalographic (EEG)\nrecording, and the recent resurgence of interest in neuronal oscil-\nlations has led to an enhanced appreciation of their likely impor-\ntance and to \u2018\u2018the tantalizing conjecture that perception, memory\nand even consciousness could result from the synchronization of\nneuronal networks\u2019\u2019 [3]. The frequency scales for the neuronal\noscillations, as presently revised, are presented in the \u2018\u2018Neuronal\nOscillations\u2019\u2019 section. Recently, new studies have been initiated\nto determine the interactions between the cardiovascular oscilla-\ntions and some of the brain waves [4]. This work is reviewed in\nthe penultimate section, and causal relations between the cardio,\nrespiratory, and brain waves are discussed with a special empha-\nsis on detection of the depth of anesthesia. The final section looks\nforward to the future and enumerates some of the open questions.\nCoupled Oscillators\nThe coupled nonlinear oscillators approach is marked by two\nmajor milestones: the introduction of the entrainment of col-\nlective oscillators by Winfree [5] and its analysis using the\nphase dynamics approach of Kuramoto [6]. Phase dynamics is\nobtained by reducing the number of degrees of freedom of the\noriginal dynamical system. The original dynamics should be\nperturbed weakly by noise, an external force, or coupling to\ndynamics with a limit-cycle orbit. The latter applies to a dissi-\npative system, and the form of the phase dynamics is not\ndependent on the form of the original models. The work of\nWinfree [5] and Kuramoto [6] further motivated the introduc-\ntion of the theory of phase synchronization, facilitating studies\nof the interactions between coupled nonlinear and chaotic\noscillators [7]. Coupled oscillators were proposed as a possi-\nble description of the dynamics of the CVS [8], [9], and\nsynchronization and modulation between cardiac and respira-\ntory oscillations were examined with particular care [10]\u2013\n[12]. The emerging picture motivated additional studies, and\nmethods for analysis of the direction of coupling among inter-\nacting oscillatory processes have recently been proposed (see\n[13] and the references therein).\nCardiovascular Oscillations\nThe System\nThe CVS, which consists of the heart and blood vessels, has\none major function\u2014transport. The total volume of blood cir-\nculates along the CVS in one minute on average. The circula-\ntory system can be divided into two parts: the pulmonary\ncirculation, which moves blood through the lungs for exchange\nof oxygen and carbon dioxide, and the systemic circulation,\nwhich supplies all other tissues (Figure 1). The systolic and\ndiastolic blood pressures have long been known to differ\nbetween the arterial and venous parts and between the systemic\nand pulmonary circulation [14].\nObserved on the macroscopic level, the heart acts as a\npump that drives the blood through a closed circuit of elas-\ntic vessels. The respiratory activity is a generator of pressure\nthat assists in the return of blood to the heart. The flow of\nblood also depends on the resistance of the vessels that is\ncontrolled by adjustment of their diameters. Consequently,\nthe power of cardiac oscillations dominates the aortic flow\nand is significantly decreased in blood flow through the\ncapillaries.\nBY ANETA STEFANOVSKA\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109\/MEMB.2007.907088\nC\nA\nRD\nIA\nC\nRH\nY\nTH\nM\nS\nComplex but Not Complicated Cardiovascular\nand Brain Interactions\nIEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY MAGAZINE 0739-5175\/07\/$25.00\u00a92007IEEE NOVEMBER\/DECEMBER 2007 25\nOscillations\nTime-frequency analysis of signals derived from respiration,\ncardiac function, and blood flow revealed the existence of five\nalmost periodic frequency components in the frequency inter-\nval 0.0095\u20132.0 Hz [9], [15]. Recently, a sixth oscillatory\ncomponent was identified in the interval 0.005\u20130.0095 Hz\n[16]. The frequency intervals are summarized in Figure 2.\nThe cardiac and respiratory oscillations have frequencies of\naround 1.0 and 0.3 Hz, respectively. They originate centrally\nand are propagated through the system. In contrast, the low-\nfrequency oscillations involved in the regulation of the ves-\nsels\u2019 resistance are generated locally. However, it is the\ncontinuous circulation of blood through the system of closed\ntubes that coordinates the local oscillatory activity of each\nindividual mechanism and evidently synchronizes it for much\nof the time. Hence, each physiological mechanism manifests as a\nsingle almost periodic process that we can observe at the macro-\nscopic level. Consequently, the peaks in the low-frequency inter-\nval are broadened and can be best distinguished using logarithmic\nfrequency resolution.\nThe physiological origin of the low-frequency oscillations\nhas been investigated using laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF).\nThe oscillations at around 0.1, 0.04, 0.01, and 0.007 Hz, respec-\ntively, have thus been associated with the intrinsic myogenic\nactivity of vascular smooth muscle, the neurogenic activity of\nthe vessel wall, and two different mechanisms of vascular endo-\nthelial function [17], [18]. Nitric oxide and endothelium-derived\nhyperpolarizing factors are hypothesized to be involved in the\noscillations near 0.01 and 0.007 Hz [16]; however, the precise\nmechanisms giving rise to them need to be further elucidated.\nThese results suggest that the CVS as a whole, including the\nmicrocirculation, can usefully be treated as a single entity. In\nterms of frequencies, it is irrele-\nvant at which point we observe\nthe system or which function we\nchoose to measure: each regula-\ntory mechanism is reflected on\nevery site, and can be detected in\neach cardiovascular function;\nhowever, its amplitude may dif-\nfer with respect to the function\nand the site of observation (see\nFigure 1). Moreover, the charac-\nteristic frequencies of the oscilla-\ntory components are shown to be\nconfined to the same intervals in\nresting healthy subjects as in rest-\ning subjects with cardiovascular\ndiseases [15]. The power within\neach interval can be used as a\nquantitative measure for charac-\nterizing the state of the system\n[9], [15].\nClinical and experimental stud-\nies have included patients with\ndiabetes mellitus, myocardial\ninfarction, and cardiac failure.\nThe perturbations of the cardio-\nvascular oscillations brought\nabout by exercise, anesthesia, and\naging have also been examined.\nFor example, based on the loga-\nrithmic frequency resolution of\nthe wavelet transform of the heart\nrate variability (HRV) signal,\ncardiac autonomic dysregulation\nwas detected [19] in diabetic\npatients prior to clinical signs of\ncardiac autonomic neuropathy.\nAnesthesia is another state where\nclinical application of the cardio-\nvascular oscillations approach\nmay be significant. In a recent\nstudy [20], a substantial decrease\nof the low-frequency components\nwas demonstrated in the blood\nflow recorded by LDF during\nlocal anesthesia.\nPulmonary CirculationSystemic Circulation\nPr\nes\nsu\nre\n (k\nPa\n)\n(a)\n13 kPa\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n1.6 kPa\nArteries Capillaries Arteries Capillaries VeinsVeins\nLeft\nHeart\nArterioles\n0 10\nTime (s)\n20 0 10\nTime (s)\n(b) (c)\n20\n0.01 0.1\nFrequency (Hz)\n1 0.01 0.1\nFrequency (Hz)\n(d) (e)\n1\nVenules Arterioles VenulesRight\nHeart\nFig. 1.

In addition, on the basis of recent measurements and analysis, the blood\nflow through the aorta and the capillaries and the amplitudes of their time-averaged\nwavelet transforms are indicated. While the amplitude of the oscillations generated by the\nheart as the main pump into the system dominates the aortic flow (d), the amplitude and\nthe corresponding power of oscillations in the capillary flow result from the central and\nperipheral regulatory mechanisms acting on a wide frequency scale (e). The six spectral\npeaks are usually estimated from 30-min recordings, while, for the sake of clarity, only 20-\nsec segments are presented here (for details see, e.g., [9], [15], [16]).\nIEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY MAGAZINE NOVEMBER\/DECEMBER 200726\nThe existence of characteristic peaks leads to the inference\nthat each subsystem can be described mathematically as an\noscillator [21], [22]. The systems are mutually dependent via\ncouplings that lead to amplitude\/frequency fluctuations and\nhence further broadening of the characteristic peaks.\nInteractions\nSimultaneous measurements of the cardiac and respiratory\nfunctions enable analysis of the cardiorespiratory interactions.\nThe resultant modulation of the cardiac frequency, known as\nrespiratory arrhythmia, has long been known to play an essen-\ntial role in the overall performance of the system. Synchroni-\nzation analysis [7], [10], [11] has confirmed that, in a\nconscious healthy subject at rest, the two systems can syn-\nchronize. We have shown that synchronization and modula-\ntion can coexist [11] and that the respiratory system is the\ndriving system at all respiration frequencies, whether paced or\nspontaneous [13]. Two different methods, time-phase bispec-\ntral analysis [23] and a new inference technique [24], were\nused to demonstrate the existence of a nonlinear cardiorespira-\ntory interaction.\nPhase synchronization between the cardiac and respiratory\noscillations has been investigated during anesthesia in rats [9].\nSynchrograms and the time-evolution of synchronization indi-\nces were used to show that the system passes reversibly\nthrough a sequence of different phase-synchronized states as\nthe anesthesia level changes, indicating that it can undergo\nphase transition-like phenomena. It was found that the\nsynchronization state may be used to characterize the depth of\nanesthesia.\nNeuronal Oscillations\nStudies of the interactions between the cardiovascular oscilla-\ntions and brain waves were then initiated [4]. The frequency\nscales for the neuronal oscillations in the rat cortex, as recently\nrevised by Buzsa\u00b4ki and Draguhn [3], are summarized in Fig-\nure 3. Neuronal oscillations span an even wider frequency\ninterval than cardiovascular oscillations, covering frequencies\nfrom 0.025 to 600 Hz.\nInteractions Between Neuronal and\nCardiovascular Oscillations\nExperiments were performed on ten adult, male Wistar rats,\neach weighing approximately 250 g. The animals were anes-\nthetized with a single intraperitoneal injection of ketamine\nhydrochloride [45 mg\/kg body weight (b.w.)] and xylazine\nhydrochloride (7 mg\/kg b.w.) and placed in a darkened Fara-\nday cage. The depth of anesthesia was assessed at 5-min inter-\nvals by a nociceptive stimulus, the skin pinch-test, applied to\nthe sole of the animal\u2019s front paw. Simultaneous recordings\nwere made of EEG over the left and right parietal cortex, of the\nelectrical activity of the heart (electrocardiogram), and of\nrespiration measured with a piezo probe attached over the ani-\nmal\u2019s chest. The three signals were sampled at 1 KHz with\n16 b resolution. The study will be presented in detail elsewhere\n[4], while here we summarize briefly the main results.\nThe instantaneous phases of the cardiac (i.e., HRV) and\nrespiratory oscillations were obtained by the marked events\nmethod, f (t) \u00bc 1=(tk\u00fe1 \u0002 tk), where tk and tk\u00fe1 are the times of\ntwo consecutive peaks. The instantaneous phases were then\nobtained as \/(t) \u00bc 2p((t \u0002 tk)=(tk\u00fe1 \u0002 tk)) \u00fe 2pk; tk<t\\tk\u00fe1,\nlinearly interpolated, and resampled with Dt \u00bc 0.05 s. The\nanalytic signal concept was used to obtain the instantaneous\nfrequency corresponding to the slow-1 d-oscillations in the\nEEG. An analytic signal f(t) was constructed from the original\ntime series. This is a complex function of time defined as\nf(t) \u00bc s(t) \u00fe \u0131sH \u00bc A(t)e\u0131\/\u00f0t\u00de, where A(t) is the amplitude, \/(t)\nis the phase of the signal s(t), and sH(t) is its Hilbert transform.\nThe instantaneous phase is given by \/(t) \u00bc arctan (sH(t)=s(t)).\nFor inferring information about the coupling, we use a\nmethod based on information theory [10] that enabled us to\nevaluate both the strength and asymmetry (directionality) of\nthe coupling.

The first period is\ncharacterized by the presence of strong slow-1\nd-oscillations, but no significant presence of\nany other oscillations in the EEG. During the\nsecond period, slow-1 d-oscillations are mark-\nedly decreased.\nThe causal relationships between slow-1 d,\ncardiac, and respiratory oscillations during\ndeep anesthesia are presented in Figure 4.\nTheir statistical significance is checked using\nsurrogate data (for details, see [4]). It is evident\nthat respiration drives the cardiac oscillations\nstrongly, whereas there is no significant influ-\nence in the opposite direction. On the other\nhand, the respiratory and slow-1 d-oscillations\nare bidirectionally coupled; however, statisti-\ncally significant evidence only for respiration\ndriving the cortical d-oscillations is established. Finally, the\nslow-1 d-oscillations drive the cardiac activity, but without any\nevidence of significant influence in the opposite direction. No\nsignature of cardiac-d interactions is obtained for any of the\nrats, and there is a high probability of there being no driving in\neither direction. Note that the analysis is based on the maxi-\nmum possible window length. This means that possible short\nepisodes of interaction will not be observed, but makes for a\nmore reliable estimate of the average interaction.\nWe conclude that interactions occur between the oscillatory\nprocesses, both within and between the cardiovascular and the\nneuronal systems. The strengths and directions of these inter-\nactions may be used, in principle, for characterization of the\nstate of the organism as demonstrated here for the case of deep\nanesthesia.\nPerspective and Open Questions\nWe have briefly discussed the oscillatory nature of the CVS and\nthe neuronal activity in the brain. We have also mentioned that\nthere exist deterministic interactions among these two vital sys-\ntems, the CVS providing for energy transfer through the orga-\nnism and the brain serving its information-processing needs.\nAlthough a clear picture is starting to emerge, the list of open\nquestions is still very long and we will now list some of them.\n\u0002 The origin of time-variability: There is a clear signature\nof oscillations in both systems. However, their ampli-\ntudes and frequencies vary in time. At present, the origin\nof these variations is unclear. One plausible explanation\nof their origin is that each of the oscillatory components ob-\nserved at macroscopic level results from an ensemble\nof oscillators at microscopic level that are spatially dis-\ntributed and not fully synchronized. To illustrate this\npossibility, let us take two extreme examples: the\ncardiac and the endothelial oscillations. The cardiac\noscillatory component is maintained through the activa-\ntion of thousands of cardiac cells. They are spatially\nlocalized and their activity is paced by stimuli from the\nsinoatrial node. Thus, the activity of the cardiac cells is\nlargely synchronized and their synchrony is manifested\nas a single, distinct, oscillatory component at the sys-\ntem level. Endothelial cells, on the other hand, are dis-\ntributed throughout the whole CVS, forming an average\nhuman network >40,000 km in length. Although the\nblood circulation through the system syn-\nchronizes their activity most of the time,\nthe effect of this spatial distribution\nresults in strong amplitude and frequency\nvariability of their oscillatory compo-\nnents. The other important source of vari-\nability most probably comes from an\ninteraction between the ensembles of\noscillators themselves.\n\u0002 The nature of interactions: The evidence\nthat the CVS oscillations interact with each\nother is growing. It is also becoming\nobvious that the interactions change with\ndisease. At present, however, the phases of\nlow-frequency oscillatory components can-\nnot be reliably traced in time and hence the\nnature of their interactions is completely\nunknown. We can possibly study some of\nthe characteristics of the interactions using\nmodels. Indeed, several types of oscillator have been pro-\nposed as the basic oscillator, ranging from Poncare\u00b4, Lie-\nnard, Van der Pol, to FitzHugh-Nagumo. Again, it is not\nobvious what is the benefit of each of this oscillators and\nwhether, in fact, the simplest, Poincare\u00b4, oscillator possesses\nall the important properties needed for a basic oscillator, or\nthe features of the other are essential in the modeling of the\ncardiovascular dynamics.\n\u0002 The cardiorespiratory interactions: The fact that the two\nsystems interact has been known for centuries [25], [26], but\nthe exact pathways of interaction are still not understood,\nalthough much progress has been made. With the theory of\ngeneralized synchronization, and the recently introduced\nalgorithms for analysis of the direction of coupling, we may\nexpect further rapid progress. However, the problem is diffi-\ncult, in part because of the huge amount of work already\ndone and the diversity of opinions already established. Con-\nventional wisdom is often difficult to overcome; but in this\ncase, the need is clear [27], [28].\n\u0002 The origin of low-frequency oscillations and their poten-\ntial connection to the immune system: To facilitate the\nresolution of this question several other problems have\nto be addressed as well.\n\u0002 Most of what is known about the low-frequency oscilla-\ntory components is based on measurements by LDF\n[17], [18], [29]. Although this technique is noninvasive\nand simple to use, as applied to the microvascular flow\npresently, it has a clear drawback, that is, the vascular\narea from which the reading is taken cannot be straight-\nforwardly defined. With a laser emitting with a wave-\nlength of 780 nm it is generally assumed that a 1 mm3\nhemisphere is being observed. However, to determine\nthe number and the type of vessels within this area, one\nneeds an imaging system that will enable visualization\nof the vascular content within the hemisphere. Such an\nimaging system is presently not available.\n\u0002 The role of the venous flow in the CVS oscillations is\npractically unknown. While the heart is the main pump\nin the arterial system, preliminary results based on\ninvasive monitoring of venous pressure have demon-\nstrated that the respiratory pump dominates the venous\nflow [30]. Further work is needed to elucidate the\ninvolvement of the venous flow in CVS oscillations.\n0\n0\n*0\nr c\n**\n0\n\u03b4\nFig. 4.

The strengths of\ncoupling are indicated by\nthe number of stars.\nIEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY MAGAZINE NOVEMBER\/DECEMBER 200728\n\u0002 Lymphatic oscillations have recently been discussed\n[31]. Mechanisms similar to the ones responsible for\nthe vascular oscillations seems to be involved\u2014\noriginating from the myogenic and endothelial regula-\ntion. Whether or not the lymphatic oscillations have\nsomething in common with the cardiovascular oscilla-\ntions is an intriguing yet fully open question.\n\u0002 The functional unit between the cardiovascular and neu-\nronal oscillations: The results briefly discussed earlier\n(but in more detail in [4]) have indicated the existence\nof a functional linkage between certain oscillations of\nthe two systems. Little is known about this interaction.\nAt the same time, an avalanche of studies points to an\nexistence of structural linkage between the two systems.\nThe astrocytes, pericytes, and other forms of glial cells\n[32], [33] are being found to play a structural link\nbetween the vasculature and the neurons. Basically, they\nbring substances, mainly electrolytes, from the blood ves-\nsels to the neurones, which they then use to maintain\nmembrane potential and to enable action potentials. If a\nsimilar avalanche could be initiated to reveal the func-\ntional link, one might expect that the picture of the cardi-\novascular and brain interactions will soon become clear.\nSimple and useful applications of this knowledge in diag-\nnosis and prediction may be expected to follow. For an\nunderstanding of this functional link, nonlinear and sto-\nchastic dynamics techniques will be crucial. Here, as well\nas with the other open questions discussed earlier, the\nrole of physics and engineering will be essential.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work has been supported by the Wellcome Trust (U.K.),\nEPSRC (U.K.), ARRS (Slovenia), and the EC NEST-\nPathfinder project BRACCIA (Brain, Respiratory and Cardiac\nCausalities in Anesthesia).
