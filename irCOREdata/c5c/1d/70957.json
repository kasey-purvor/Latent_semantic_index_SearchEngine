The effects of stress on basic memory processes is examined, and\npotential neurobiological changes relevant to memory development are examined. The impact of maltreatment-\nrelated sequelae ~including dissociation and depression! on basic memory processes as well as false memories and\nsuggestibility are also outlined. Although there is a clear need for additional research, the investigations that do exist\nreveal that maltreated children\u2019s basic memory processes are not reliably different from that of other, nonmaltreated\nchildren.\nThe field of developmental psychopathology\nhas been characterized by a focus on the bi-\ndirectional relations between normal and atyp-\nical development ~Cicchetti, 1984, 1993;\nCicchetti & Cohen, 2006; Rutter & Sroufe, 2000;\nSroufe, 1991; Sroufe & Rutter, 1984!. As such,\nthe discipline of developmental psychopathol-\nogy lends itself to providing a framework for\nthe translation of normal developmental theory\nand research toward understanding develop-\nmental processes in atypical and disordered\npopulations ~Cicchetti & Toth, 2006!.\nGiven its emphasis on interdisciplinary col-\nlaborative efforts, the mutually enriching in-\nterplay between work with normal and atypical\npopulations, and the examination of multiple\ndomains of development ~Cicchetti & Cohen,\n2006; Cicchetti & Dawson, 2002; Cicchetti &\nSroufe, 2000; Institute of Medicine, 1989!, a\ndevelopmental psychopathology perspective\nserves as a powerful impetus for translating\nbasic research on memory into the arena of\nchild maltreatment. In this article, we draw\nfrom the normative literature on memory in\nchildren to ascertain whether experiences of\ntrauma differentially affect the operation of\nmemory in maltreated children.\nTrauma and Memory\nAre traumatic experiences remembered better\nthan nontraumatic experiences? Although most\nwould agree that traumatic events are well\netched in memory, there is considerable dis-\nagreement concerning their retrievability. On\nthe one hand, there are those who suggest that\nalthough traumatic experiences are well en-\ncoded and stored, their retrievability into con-\nscious awareness is inhibited by protective or\ndefensive processes ~e.g., Brewin & Andrews,\n1998; Herman, 1992!. On the other hand, there\nis considerable evidence that traumatic events\nare not only well encoded and stored, but also\nare easily retrieved given the appropriate cues,\nmuch like other memories ~e.g., Howe, Cour-\nage, & Peterson, 1994!. Indeed, traumatic ex-\nperiences are often all too easily retrieved and\ninvoluntarily intrude into consciousness ~e.g.,\nHolmes, Grey, & Young, 2005!.\nMost of the empirical evidence is consis-\ntent with this latter view.

In-\ndeed, it is well documented that memories for\ntrauma are generally very well retained, cer-\ntainly better than memories for everyday, mun-\ndane events ~e.g., Berntsen & Thomsen, 2005!.\nThe reasons may be many and include possi-\nble neurobiological mechanisms such as emo-\ntional tagging of arousing events ~Richter-\nLevin & Akirav, 2003!, the enhanced role of\nthe amygdala in the encoding, storage, and\nretrieval of emotionally arousing material\n~Adolphs, Denburg, & Tranel, 2001; Adolphs,\nTranel, & Buchanan, 2005; Buchanan, Kara-\nfin, & Adolphs, 2003!, and changes in adren-\nergic and corticosteroid hormonal regulation\n~e.g., Abercrombie, Kalin, Thurow, Rosen-\nkranz, & Davidson, 2003; Domes, Rothfis-\ncher, Reichwald, & Hautzinger, 2005; Maheu,\nJoober, Beaulieu, & Lupien, 2004!. In addi-\ntion, there are any number of attentional and\nencoding variables that might lead to the en-\nhancement of memory for trauma, particu-\nlarly heightened sensitivity to environmental\ncues that signal risk, an attentional hypervig-\nilance that makes an individual more alert to\ntrauma-related cues in the environment ~for a\nreview, see Howe, Toth, & Cicchetti, 2006!.\nHowever, the very processes that lead to\nbetter memory for traumatic events may lead\nto later alterations in basic memory processes.\nIt has been speculated that to the extent stress-\nors become a permanent fixture in a person\u2019s\nlife ~particularly a child\u2019s!, what these changes\ncould lead to are alterations in the way in\nwhich basic memory processes operate. For\nexample, there is some evidence that early\ntraumatic experiences can lead to alterations\nin hippocampal volume in some animals ~spe-\ncifically dendritic atrophy in the tree shrew;\nsee Lucassen et al., 2001!, although reports in\nhumans are not as conclusive ~for a review,\nsee Howe et al., 2006!. Moreover, stress-\ninduced elevations in adrenal steroid levels\nhave been linked to changes in neuronal con-\nnectivity in the hippocampus, ones that have\nbehavioral correlates associated with memory\n~spatial and short term; McEwen, 1999!. Al-\nthough these changes may be transient, there\nis recent evidence suggesting persistent neuro-\nbiological changes ~e.g., decreased adult neuro-\ngenesis! that result from early stressful\nexperiences ~Karten, Olariu, & Cameron, 2005;\nKempermann, 2005; Lemaire, Koehl, Le Moal,\n& Abrous, 2000!.\nHowever, does this mean that the basic\nmemory processes that subserve the encod-\ning, storage, retrieval, and retention of trau-\nmatic events are not subject to the same laws\nas those more mundane, everyday memories?\nAs already noted, the empirical literature makes\nit abundantly clear that memories for trau-\nmatic events are better retained than those for\nmore mundane events, particularly when those\nevents are important ~e.g., Berntsen & Thom-\nsen, 2005! or have significant personal conse-\nquences ~e.g., Alexander et al., 2005!.\nHowever, it is equally clear that traumatic\nmemories are just as malleable ~e.g., Nour-\nkova, Bernstein, & Loftus, 2004!, reconstruc-\ntive ~Wessel & Wright, 2004!, susceptible to\nsuggestion ~Eisen & Carlson, 1998!, and for-\ngotten with time ~Wagenaar & Groeneweg,\n1990; Wessel & Wright, 2004! as are more\nmundane events.\nAlthough there is a considerable literature\nsupporting these conclusions ~for a review,\nsee Howe et al., 2006!, much of this work has\nbeen conducted with people who have experi-\nenced a single, acute traumatic episode ~e.g.,\nemergency room experience, tornado, war,\ndeath of a loved one!. The question remains,\ndo these conclusions hold for populations in\nwhich the trauma is ongoing and the stress\nchronic? Moreover, are such conclusions ap-\nplicable to populations in which the neural\nsubstrates associated with memory are still\ndeveloping? Specifically, do the neurobiolog-\nical effects of chronic stress impact memory\nprocesses essential to remembering everyday\nand traumatic events, particularly in young\nchildren whose brains are still developing. That\nis, are basic memory processes ~encoding, stor-\nage, retrieval, and retention! compromised by\nstress in maltreated children, and if so, does\nthis lead to more impoverished memory traces,\nones that are weaker, less resistant to interfer-\nence, and more susceptible to suggestion. These\nquestions are addressed in the remainder of\nthis article where we examine the reliability\nof children\u2019s recollections for courtroom tes-\n760 M. L. Howe, D. Cicchetti, and S. L. Toth\ntimony and answer questions concerning the\nconsequences of chronic stress on children\u2019s\nsusceptibility to suggestion and false memo-\nries. We conclude with some speculation con-\ncerning the impact various therapeutic and legal\ninterventions may have on the reliability of\nchildren\u2019s event memory over time.\nChild maltreatment and memory\nNeurobiological factors. What makes mem-\nory reliable? Once an event has been experi-\nenced, what is encoded and stored depends\nnot only on the external stimulus situation but\nalso on a person\u2019s expectations, knowledge,\nand processing capacity ~for a review, see\nHowe, 2000!. Whatever information is en-\ncoded can then be stored in memory for later\nretrieval. If the information being stored is of\na traumatic nature, then in addition to the usual\nconsolidation activity that leads to trace stor-\nage, other amygdala- and hormonally related\ninputs help the formation of a stable, well-\nintegrated memory trace ~for a review, see\nHowe et al., 2006!. Because of these addi-\ntional inputs, traumatic experiences are not\nonly stored quite well but also are retained\nremarkably well over long periods of time.\nGenerally speaking, the better encoded and\nstored information is, the better integrated the\ntrace structure, and the stronger, more durable\nthe trace is over the long term ~e.g., Howe,\n2000!.\nAlthough most researchers would agree that\ntraumatic events are stored quite well, they\ndisagree on what happens to these traces dur-\ning retention as well as what happens during\nattempts to retrieve information from these\nmemories. At one extreme, there are those who\nwould claim that once stored, traumatic mem-\nories become inaccessible to conscious recol-\nlection because they are repressed ~e.g., Janet,\n190701920; van der Kolk & Fisler, 1995!. Re-\npression is a defense mechanism that prevents\nthe person from becoming aware of the trau-\nmatic events and serves to protect them from\nthe potentially negative consequences that re-\nliving the trauma might cause, psychically. It\nis also speculated that although the memory is\nrepressed, it remains accurate in all of its de-\ntail and is not subject to the usual forgetting\nforces ~interference, decay, and so on! that\nbefall other, consciously accessible memories.\nThese ideas stand in stark contrast to the\nempirical facts.As already noted, there is over-\nwhelming evidence that the majority of trau-\nmatic experiences, including physical and sexual\nabuse in childhood, can be recalled ~Alexander\net al., 2005; Berntsen & Thomsen, 2005;\nCordon, Pipe, Sayfan, Melinder, & Goodman,\n2004; Howe et al., 2006!. Moreover, traumatic\nmemories are subject to the same forces over\ntime as are nontraumatic memory traces. That\nis, they undergo forgetting ~Wagenaar & Groe-\nneweg, 1990!, are subject to interference from\nother memory traces ~Howe, Courage, & Pe-\nterson, 1995!, and can be affected by misinfor-\nmation ~Eisen, Qin, Goodman, & Davis, 2002!.\nThese findings suggest that repression, if it ex-\nists at all, does not prevent conscious recollec-\ntion of traumatic experiences nor does it protect\nmemories from being forgotten or altered in a\nmanner similar to other memory traces. Given\nthe overwhelming number of studies confirm-\ning the ease with which traumatic experiences\ncan be recalled, it is no wonder that many have\nquestioned whether repression occurs at all ~see\nLoftus, 1994!.\nGiven that traumatic memories are better\nstored than more mundane memories and that\nmemories for traumatic experiences are rea-\nsonably easy to bring to mind voluntarily ~as\nwell as involuntarily; see Holmes et al., 2005!,\nis there any evidence that the prolonged stress\nassociated with chronic maltreatment in child-\nhood should somehow perturb these basic\n\u201claws\u201d of memory? To answer this question,\nconsider the neurobiological consequences of\nchild maltreatment. There is some evidence\nthat myelinated areas of the developing brain\nare particularly susceptible to chronic stress\n~see De Bellis, 2005!. However, adverse neu-\nral development has so far only been associ-\nated with maltreatment-related posttraumatic\nstress disorder ~PTSD!. For example, children\nwith maltreatment-related PTSD, particularly\nmales, have been shown to have a smaller\ncorpus callosum ~De Bellis et al., 1999; Teicher\net al., 1997!. There is also evidence for de-\ncreased cerebral volumes and attenuation of\nfrontal lobe asymmetry in maltreated children\nwith PTSD ~Carrion et al., 2001!. Finally,\nChildren\u2019s basic memory processes 761\nmaltreatment-related PTSD is also associated\nwith smaller cerebral and frontal cortices, less\nprefrontal white matter, and reduced right tem-\nporal lobe volumes ~De Bellis et al., 2002!.\nClearly, then, child maltreatment that is asso-\nciated with PTSD can and does have adverse\nconsequences for neurological development,\nparticularly in terms of age-appropriate\nmyelination.\nOf interest, none of these studies found ad-\nverse effects specific to neurological struc-\ntures associated with memory. The smaller\nhippocampal volumes that have been reported\nfor adults with child maltreatment-related\nPTSD ~e.g., Bremner et al., 1997! has not been\nreported in the cross-sectional studies of pe-\ndiatric PTSD just discussed nor have they been\nobtained in short-term longitudinal studies of\npediatric maltreatment-related PTSD ~e.g., De\nBellis, Hall, Boring, Frustaci, & Moritz, 2001!.\nIndeed, there is the suggestion that hippocam-\npal volumes might actually be larger in pedi-\natric PTSD ~De Bellis, 2005!. One explanation\nfor this discrepancy is that for maltreated chil-\ndren there is a higher risk for alcohol and\nsubstance abuse in adolescence and adulthood\n~De Bellis, 2002!, behaviors that are related to\ndecreased hippocampal volume ~e.g., De Bel-\nlis et al., 2000!. Alternatively, it may simply\nbe that the adverse effects of chronic stress do\nnot manifest themselves in the hippocampus\nuntil postpubertal development. Finally, these\ndifferences may be the result of neurogenesis\nin the hippocampus and frontal cortex ~e.g.,\nGould & Gross, 2002; Kempermann, 2005!.\nThus, neurodevelopmental plasticity and nor-\nmal developmental increases in the hippo-\ncampus may \u201cmask\u201d any adverse effects of\nmaltreatment. Thus, it does not appear that the\nchronic stress associated with maltreatment in\nchildhood has any long-term deleterious ef-\nfects on brain structures that are associated\nwith memory. Although there do exist more\nglobal volumetric differences, it is not clear\nhow or if these are related to memory. More\nimportantly, these differences in neurobiolog-\nical measures have not been linked to differ-\nences in children\u2019s memory performance.\nClinical considerations. What about differ-\nences in memory performance as a function\nof the psychological sequelae associated with\nchild maltreatment? That is, do maltreated chil-\ndren perform more poorly than their nonmal-\ntreated counterparts on memory tests as a\nfunction of psychopathologies or other se-\nquelae that are a consequence of maltreat-\nment? The quick answer is no. Indeed,\nmaltreated children generally perform as well\nas other children on basic memory tasks, al-\nthough this conclusion is based on relatively\nfew studies.\nTo begin, consider memory studies of chil-\ndren who have maltreatment-related PTSD.\nAlthough considerable memory research has\nbeen conducted with adults diagnosed with\nPTSD, little research has been conducted with\nchildren. This is due in part to difficulties as-\nsociated with PTSD diagnoses in children.\nThose studies that have been conducted have\nnot produced a consistent set of findings. For\nexample, children with PTSD performed more\npoorly than children without PTSD on a task\nthat tapped long-term memory for everyday\nevents ~Moradi, Doost, Taghavi, Yule, & Dal-\ngleish, 1999!. However, others have found no\ndifferences in memory performance between\nchildren with and without PTSD ~e.g., Beers\n& De Bellis, 2002!. Eisen et al. ~2002! found\nthat for maltreated children age 3 to 17 years,\nPTSD symptoms were associated with more\nerrors of commission but also were associated\nwith more correct recall. In general, then, those\nstudies that have examined trauma- or\nmaltreatment-related PTSD symptoms and\nchildren\u2019s long-term event memory have failed\nto find any consistent relationship between\nthe PTSD and memory performance. Thus, it\nturns out that children\u2019s memory performance\nis unrelated to clinician\u2019s diagnoses of PTSD\n~also see Cordon et al., 2004!.\nOf interest, dissociation has been found to\nbe related to better, not worse, memory in\nchildren. Dissociation is thought to occur dur-\ning and immediately after a traumatic event,\nand serves either to reduce the amount of in-\nformation encoded during the event or to iso-\nlate traumatic memories after the event, thereby\npreventing rehearsal but helping the individ-\nual cope. Unlike repression, dissociation does\nnot cause these memories to become con-\nsciously unavailable, simply harder to access.\n762 M. L. Howe, D. Cicchetti, and S. L. Toth\nGiven their reduced accessibility, it is thought\nthat at the very least dissociation should limit\nrehearsal leading to faster deterioration of\ntrauma-related memory traces ~Fivush &\nSchwarzmueller, 1995!. Dissociation is thought\nto be available early in infancy ~Liotti, 1992!\nand in childhood, with younger children being\nmore reliant on this mechanism to cope with\nstress than older children and adults ~Lynn &\nRhue, 1994; Putnam, 1997!.\nWhat this suggests is that memory should\nbe poorer in those children who evidence dis-\nsociation than in those who do not. As already\nnoted, the evidence is quite the reverse. For\nexample, children as young as 3 years of age\nwho were the victims of maltreatment and\nscored high on measures of dissociation actu-\nally had more detailed memories of their abuse\nthan did children who scored low on dissoci-\nation ~Eisen et al., 2002!. Thus, similar to the\nfindings for PTSD, dissociation does not ap-\npear to have a deleterious effect on maltreated\nchildren\u2019s basic memory processes.\nFinally, child maltreatment is a known risk\nfactor for major depressive disorders ~Heim\n& Nemeroff, 2001!. Depression has been as-\nsociated with overgeneral memory responses\n~i.e., producing generic scriptlike responses\nrather than specific memories! on autobio-\ngraphical memory tests particularly with adults\n~e.g., Williams, 1996!, although this result is\nnot routinely observed ~see Wessel, Merckel-\nbach, & Dekkers, 2002!. In the only study\nconducted with children, more generic re-\nsponses were produced by children whose ex-\nperience of trauma ~in this case, family\nviolence!was accompanied by depression ~Or-\nbach, Lamb, Sternberg, Williams, & Dawud-\nNoursi, 2001!. However, as with PTSD and\ndissociation, these findings are not as simple\nand straightforward as one might like. There\nis considerable evidence that traumatized and\ndepressed individuals can and do recall spe-\ncific autobiographical episodes. In fact, recall\nof specific memories in these tasks routinely\nexceeds 50% and this number frequently\nclimbs to over 75% ~Dalgleish et al., 2003!,\nsuggesting that generic recall is the exception\nnot the rule. Although a number of other prob-\nlems exist in the literature relating depression\nand event recall ~see Howe et al., 2006!, it can\nbe concluded that maltreatment-related depres-\nsion, like maltreatment-related PTSD and dis-\nsociation, does not portend changes in\nchildren\u2019s basic memory processes.\nFalse memories and suggestibility. Thus far,\nthere are no reasons to believe that the chronic\nstress associated with child maltreatment has\nany detrimental impact on children\u2019s basic\nmemory processes. Although considerably\nmore research is needed, particularly longitu-\ndinal studies, the available evidence from\nneurobiological and clinical studies shows that\nmaltreated children perform as well, and some-\ntimes better, on many everyday memory tasks\nas do their nonmaltreated counterparts. In this\nsection we consider potential differences in\nareas of memory functioning that have partic-\nular forensic relevance, namely false memo-\nries and susceptibility to suggestion and\nmisinformation. Although maltreated children\u2019s\nbasic memory functioning may be indistin-\nguishable from other children\u2019s, perhaps\nmaltreatment-related sequelae will have an im-\npact on these children\u2019s susceptibility to mis-\ninformation generally, and the creation of false\nmemories, specifically.\nOnce stored in memory, event information\nremains dynamic and can interact with new,\nincoming information ~e.g., see Howe, 2000!.\nMore specifically, new and sometimes mis-\nleading information can interfere with previ-\nously stored traces, either creating false\nrecollections or interfering with recall such\nthat misinformation is produced rather than\nthe original event. Young children are partic-\nularly susceptible to misinformation effects\n~although not necessarily to all forms of false\nmemory; see later discussion in this section!\nand are highly susceptible to suggestion and\nmisleading questions ~Bruck & Ceci, 1999;\nCeci & Friedman, 2000!. This does not mean\nthat children do not recall events correctly or\nthat they will assent to all types of misinfor-\nmation or misleading questions. For example,\nchildren tend not to be misled when the sug-\ngested actions are very different from those\nthat were witnessed or experienced ~see Pipe,\nLamb, Orbach, & Esplin, 2004!. However,\nwhen misinformation refers to details experi-\nenced in a related context ~e.g., Roberts &\nChildren\u2019s basic memory processes 763\nBlades, 1998! or that are more plausible and\ncongruent with the event ~e.g., Lindberg,\nKeiffer, & Thomas, 2000; Pezdek & Hodge,\n1999!, children are more susceptible to\nsuggestion.\nThere are a variety of explanations for the\neffects of misinformation, ranging from social\ncompliance ~Bruck & Ceci, 1999! to source\nmonitoring errors, something that prevents chil-\ndren ~and sometimes adults! from correctly\ndiscriminating original event information from\nsubsequently encoded, and potentially mislead-\ning, information ~Roberts, 2002!. It is also\nbelieved that misinformation effects are more\nlikely when the strength of the original event\ninformation in memory is low ~Holliday, Doug-\nlas, & Hayes, 1999; Pezdek & Hodge, 1999;\nbut see Marche & Howe, 1995! and when the\ncontent is self-generated or imagined rather\nthan experienced ~Foley & Johnson, 1985!. In\nforensic cases, some therapeutic techniques\nrequire children to imagine the context in which\nthe criminal events occurred, use props to aid\nrecall, or actually revisit the context in which\nthe event occurred. Although these techniques\ncan enhance recall under certain conditions,\nall of these techniques also enhance misinfor-\nmation and suggestibility effects ~for a re-\nview, see Salmon, 2001!. Indeed, it is well\nknown that many techniques that are routinely\nused to improve recollection also increase the\nlikelihood of false memories ~for reviews, see\nEverson & Boat, 2002; Sternberg, Lamb, Es-\nplin, Orbach, & Hershkowitz, 2002!.\nIs there any reason to believe that children\u2019s\nmemories for traumatic events should be any\nmore or less susceptible to false recollection,\nmisinformation, or suggestibility? If so, would\nthis be any different for children whose trauma\nwas ongoing and who were subject to\nmaltreatment-related chronic stress? On the\none hand, it could be hypothesized that mem-\nories for traumatic events, regardless of\nwhether they are acute or ongoing, should be\nhighly resistant to suggestion because they are\nbetter encoded and stored in memory than other\nevents. ~Of course, if one believes that disso-\nciation limits encoding or reduces rehearsal\nlimiting the strength of memory traces for\ntraumatic events, then one would predict\nheightened suggestibility. However, because\ndissociation does not appear to have the pre-\ndicted effects when examined empirically, such\npredictions about suggestibility also seem\ngroundless.! On the other hand, because chil-\ndren are often reticent to discuss matters per-\ntaining to abuse, the use of more intense\ninterviewing techniques may produce higher\nrates of true and false recall. As well, depend-\ning on the interviewing technique being used\nand whether it is coupled with therapeutic in-\ntervention, by the time a child testifies about\nthe abusive events, there is the distinct possi-\nbility that the child\u2019s recollection will have\nincorporated any misinformation that was gen-\nerated during prior interviews. Moreover,\nmaltreatment-related sequelae, although not re-\nlated directly to recall as we have seen, may\nbe important when considering a child\u2019s sus-\nceptibility to misinformation and false mem-\nories. That is, differences in dissociation,\nabsorption, and psychopathology may contrib-\nute to variations in suggestibility rates ~Eisen\n& Carlson, 1998; Eisen & Lynn, 2001!. For\nexample, dissociative children may exhibit less\nconfidence in their memories, something that\nmay translate into a greater vulnerability to\nmisinformation. Such a pattern of increased\nsusceptibility to suggestion ~Eisen & Lynn,\n2001!, implantation of false memories ~Hy-\nman & Billings, 1998!, and mistaking imag-\nined events for real ones ~Heaps & Nash, 1999!\nhas been obtained with adults who score high\non tests of dissociation.\nTo anticipate the answer to this question\nwith children, what little research there is on\nthis topic shows that maltreated children are\nno more or less susceptible to misleading in-\nformation ~Eisen et al., 2002! or false memo-\nries ~Howe, Cicchetti, Toth, & Cerrito, 2004!\nthan their nonmaltreated counterparts. This\ndoes not mean that maltreated children are not\nsusceptible to suggestion or false memories,\nsimply that they are no more vulnerable to\nthese effects than are other children. More-\nover, like other children ~Bruck & Melnyk,\n2004; Chae & Ceci, 2005!, individual and age\ndifferences in maltreated children\u2019s suscepti-\nbility to misleading information exist.\nTo begin, consider some recent work on\nchild maltreatment and suggestibility. Eisen\net al. ~2002! examined children ~3\u201317 years\n764 M. L. Howe, D. Cicchetti, and S. L. Toth\nold! who had been referred to an inpatient\nchild abuse evaluation unit in a large hospital.\nThere were three groups of children: those\nwho were abused ~physical abuse, sexual\nabuse, or both physical and sexual abuse!, those\nwho were neglected, and those who were nei-\nther abused nor neglected. Among the battery\nof tests, children were given an anogenital\nexamination as well as a psychological con-\nsultation. At some point during the second\nand fifth days of the hospital experience ~usu-\nally the day after the psychological consulta-\ntion!, children participated in a forensic\ninterview. Using a semistructured interview\nprocedure that minimized but did not elimi-\nnate leading questions, the interviewer also\nprompted recall using anatomical dolls, body\ncharts, and other props to elicit as much infor-\nmation as possible about the maltreatment. On\nthe fifth day, children were also interviewed\nabout the anogenital examination they had un-\ndergone earlier in the week.\nOverall, Eisen et al. ~2002! found that age\nwas the major predictor of children\u2019s memory\nperformance, not abuse status. Indeed,\nmaltreated children were no more likely to be\nconfused by misleading questions than were\nnonmaltreated children. Moreover, individual\ndifferences in psychopathology, intelligence,\nor dissociation did not predict memory errors\nor suggestibility rates. It would seem that\nmaltreated children are no different than other\nchildren when it comes to memory for trau-\nmatic experiences or their susceptibility to sug-\ngestion concerning stressful events.\nAlthough maltreated children may not be\nmore suggestible when it comes to memory\nfor traumatic experiences, it is conceivable\nthat there are differences in their false mem-\nory rates for neutral material. Howe et al.\n~2004! examined this question using the\nDeese\u2013Roediger\u2013McDermott ~DRM! para-\ndigm ~Deese, 1959; Roediger & McDermott,\n1995!. Here, children were exposed to lists of\neveryday words that converge on a single un-\npresented concept. For example, children might\nhear the words bed, rest, awake, tired, dream,\nwake, snooze, blanket, doze, slumber, snore,\nand nap. All of these words are associated\nwith the unpresented critical lure sleep. When\nasked to recall this list of words, children ~and\nadults! frequently include the unpresented lure\nsleep as part of their output stream. The rates\nof false recall using this paradigm can rival\nthat of true recall for both children and adults.\nMoreover, false memories can be more dura-\nble than true memories, persisting over longer\nretention intervals for both children and adults\n~for a review, see Brainerd & Reyna, 2005!.\nUnlike suggestibility effects, false memory\nillusions of this sort increase with age across\nchildhood and into adulthood. This may be be-\ncause of corresponding developmental changes\nin semantic memory ~e.g., Brainerd & Reyna,\n2005!, children\u2019s ability to process associative\nrelations automatically ~Howe, 2005!, or both.\nRegardless, like true recall, false memories\nincrease with age in the DRM paradigm.\nIn the Howe et al. ~2004! study, 60 middle\nsocioeconomic status children, 51 nonmal-\ntreated low socioeconomic status children, and\n48 maltreated low socioeconomic status chil-\ndren were examined using the DRM proce-\ndure. Of the 48 maltreated children, 65% were\nemotionally maltreated, 83% were neglected,\n31% were physically abused, and 17% were\nsexually abused. Consistent with the nature of\nmaltreatment, the majority of maltreated chil-\ndren in this sample ~69%! had experienced\nmultiple subtypes of maltreatment.\nAll of the children ~ranging in age from 5\nto 12 years old! were presented 12 different\nDRM lists using standard procedures and both\nrecall and recognition measures. The results\nshowed that, like suggestibility, false memory\nrates were related to age and not abuse status.\nFor all groups of children, true and false mem-\nories increased with age but did not vary as a\nfunction of maltreatment. Although there were\noverall differences in recall rates as a function\nof socioeconomic status consistent with other\nfindings in the literature on children\u2019s mem-\nory development, these differences were inde-\npendent of maltreatment status.\nThus, despite reasons to believe that chronic\nstress associated with maltreatment might\nsomehow alter children\u2019s susceptibility to sug-\ngestion and false memories, the results of two\nrelatively large scale and independent studies\nsuggest otherwise. Of course, many more stud-\nies are needed before we can conclude that there\nare no demonstrable effects of maltreatment on\nChildren\u2019s basic memory processes 765\nchildren\u2019s susceptibility to misinformation ef-\nfects for neutral ~Howe et al., 2004! or trau-\nmatic memories ~Eisen et al., 2002!. Indeed,\nthere are some clear drawbacks to both of these\nstudies that limit their generalizability. The ma-\nterials used in the Howe et al. ~2004! study in\nno way parallel the false memories alleged by\nsome in forensic settings. Similarly, the inter-\nview techniques used by Eisen et al. ~2002!were\ncertainly less biased than those alleged to have\nbeen used in some clinical and forensic envi-\nronments. These caveats aside, the research that\ndoes exist indicates that maltreated children are\nno poorer or better than other children at cor-\nrect recall, false recall, or resisting misinfor-\nmation. Instead, like the larger literature on\nchildren\u2019s memory development, the main fac-\ntor controlling these differences in memory per-\nformance was age.\nThese findings possess important clinical\nand sociolegal implications. First, it is impor-\ntant to recognize that children who have been\ntraumatized are no more likely to report inac-\ncurately on their experiences than are nontrau-\nmatized children. Therapists need to accept\nchildren\u2019s recollections while carefully avoid-\ning interpretations that might result in incor-\nrect embellishment. It is particularly critical\nthat lawyers and judges not view the testi-\nmony of traumatized children as somehow dis-\ntorted as a function of the trauma, but rather\nrecognize that these children\u2019s memories are\nlikely to be as accurate as are recollections of\nage-matched nontraumatized children.\nCaveats, Conclusions, and\nFuture Prospects\nWhat this overview has shown is that despite\nthe chronic stress associated with child mal-\ntreatment, it is extremely difficult to provide\nevidence that children\u2019s basic memory pro-\ncesses are adversely affected. Although there\nis good reason to believe that basic memory\nprocesses should be affected by maltreatment,\nneurobiological, clinical, and basic memory\nstudies have not been able to uncover any\ndifferences. Indeed, it did not matter whether\nwe looked at encoding, storage, retention, or\nretrieval, maltreated children performed much\nlike their nonmaltreated counterparts. Differ-\nences in dissociation, psychopathology, intel-\nligence, and PTSD, among other factors, did\nnot discriminate the memory performance of\nmaltreated and nonmaltreated children.\nAlthough repeated confirmation of the null\nhypothesis makes it difficult to draw strong\nconclusions, ones that go much beyond a rea-\nsonable doubt, the research reviewed here does\nleave us wondering where the memory differ-\nences might lie? Clearly, the studies con-\nducted to date give us no reason to believe\nthat a difference set of memory development\n\u201claws\u201d pertain to those who have been abused\nand those who have not.\nHaving said this, of course, it is also clear\nthat we need a considerably larger body of re-\nsearch before we can close the book on this mat-\nter. In particular, there is a need to conduct\nlongitudinal studies where long-term changes\nin memory due to stress and maltreatment-\nrelated sequelae can be tracked within individ-\nuals. Moreover, we need a more comprehensive\nbattery of memory tests, individual differences\nmeasures, and more precise subtyping of mal-\ntreatment. It may be that as we obtain these more\nmicroanalytic measures on more and more chil-\ndren across longer time frames, we will begin\nto see maltreatment-related differences in ba-\nsic memory processes and their development.\nHowever, until that time, the studies reviewed\nhere provide no rationale for the claim that ba-\nsic memory processes or their development con-\nform to a different set of rules for maltreated\nchildren than other, nonmaltreated children.The\nwork reported herein also exemplifies the util-\nity of drawing from a body of basic research\nwith normative populations of children and ex-\nporting hypotheses and methods to popula-\ntions of children experiencing adversity.\nReferences\nAbercrombie, H.
