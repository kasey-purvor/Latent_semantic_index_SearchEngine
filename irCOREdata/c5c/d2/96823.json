Experience in other \nareas of science has demonstrated that such systems require mathematical formulation to con- \ncisely express the underlying dynamics and interactions, to elicit a clear understanding of the \noutcome of the interactions, and to investigate the potential effects of manipulation of the system. \nHowever, clinical medicine has not generally integrated theoretical analysis into its understand- \ning of tumor biology. We submit that this has impeded progress in clinical oncology because \nthe vast amounts of data generated by molecular biology and other new technologies have not \nbeen synthesized into a coherent, comprehensive paradigm. Furthermore, because of the absence \nof a sound theoretical framework, design and the evaluation of therapeutic approaches remain \n0893-9659\/02\/$ - see front matter (~) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This is well summarized by the authors \nof [2]: \"In general . . .  progress with the vexing problem of anticancer selectivity has been slow--a \nmatter of trial and error and guesswork as much as rational calculation. In the search for better \nways of curbing the survival, proliferation, and spread of cancer cells, it is important o examine \nmore closely the strategies by which they thrive and multiply.\" \nThe purpose of this paper is not to develop a comprehensive model of the tumor-host interface, \nbut rather to provide the simplest possible mathematical framework which encompasses the \ncritical behavior of this interface, namely, the advance of tumor tissue into the surrounding host \ntissue, and to elucidate key biological parameters controlling this behavior. Within the context of \nthis framework we show that we can understand the effectiveness of various treatment approaches \nas well as suggest new therapeutic strategies. \nWe believe that this analysis provides insight into tumor biology and treatment not available \nby other means and illustrates the potentially critical role of mathematical nalysis in successfully \nunderstanding and treating tumor invasion. \nMETHODS \nIn developing the model, we use an \"inverse problem\" approach. That is, we assume that the \nknown behaviors of the tumor-host interface represent the potential solutions of state equations \ngoverning the system. By examining the constraints imposed by the solutions, we can determine \nthe general form of the state equations and examine critical parameters that control the behavior \nof the system. \nFirst, we propose that, mathematically, the tumor-host interface of an invasive cancer is mor- \nphologically a traveling wave in which the tumor edge represents the wave front propagating into \nand replacing the surrounding normal tissue. This is based on extensive clinical observation of \ntumor growth demonstrating tumor volume increases by Gompertizian or logistic functions with \nthe tumor edge invading into adjacent normal tissue at a regular ate [3-6]. We have discussed this \nmore extensively in other publications [7]. Therefore, we infer that a mathematical description \nof tumor invasion must be a system of equations that can exhibit traveling wave solutions. \nFurthermore, since observable, untreated cancers propagate into normal tissue, this mathemat- \nical system must also yield solutions in which the tumor state and the normal tissue state are \nstable in isolation but the latter is unstable in the presence of tumor and will therefore inevitably \nbe invaded by tumor. That is, when tumor is present in normal tissue the governing system \nmust result in a traveling wave representing the transition from an unstable steady state (normal \ntissue) to a stable steady state (tumor). \nIf we denote by N(x, t) and T(x, t) normal and tumor cell density, respectively, at time t and \nspatial position x, then the existence of a constant speed traveling wave indicates that the solution \nof the state equations must be written in the general form \nN(x,  t) = N(x  :1: ct), \nT(x, t) = T(x + ct), \n(1) \nwhere c is the wave speed. Such a solution is a constant profile traveling wave moving in the \npositive (with -c )  or negative (with +c) x direction. The wave boundary is a transition region \nfrom normal tissue to malignant issue with the tumor front propagating into normal tissue \nat speed c. Note that for equation (1) to be valid, we are assuming that the tumor front is \napproximately a plane-wave, i.e., the radius of curvature of the entire tumor is much greater than \nany length scales characterizing the tumor-host interface. In such a case, which is generally true \nfor late-time growth, the direction x is along any line perpendicular to the tumor surface. \nAnalysis of Tumor 341 \nIn a mixture of populations competing for space and substrate, the governing system that will \ngive rise to a traveling wave solution typically takes the form [8] \nOn _-- fin] + - 02n \nv 0x2' (2) \nwhere n is the vector whose components represent the population densities, f is the nonlinear \npopulation kinetics function, and D is a diagonal matrix of diffusion coefficients presumed to be \ngreater than zero. The simplest conceptualization f the tumor-host interface is that derived from \na population ecology picture in which populations of tumor cells and normal cells compete for \nthe same spatial volume and nutritive substrate and interact with one another through a variety \nof potentially complex mechanisms. Each population initially grows according to a Malthusian \ngrowth law but is limited to some maximum carrying capacity, with the growth rates and carrying \ncapacities possibly being different for each population. \nIt is reasonable to assume that a variety of interactions between the cellular populations have \nadverse ffects on each population and can be included in lumped, phenomenological ompetition \nterms. The simplest and most widely used of these models is of the Lotka~Volterra type. There \nare a variety of other mathematical models of tumor growth kinetics (see, e.g., [9, Chapter 3]) \nwhich provide equal or perhaps greater quantitative fidelity to growth rates observed in vitro \nthan does the Lotka-Volterra model. However, because all such models, including Lotka-Volterra, \npredict the same qualitative behavior, we have employed the one that is both simple to analyze \nmathematically and which effectively illustrates our point [10,11]. For simplicity, we write the \nLotka-Volterra equations for (2) with one dominant umor population, T, interacting with one \ndominant native (normal) cell population, N: \nON ( N bNTT~ 02N \nOt = rNN 1 KN KN ] + DN Ox 2 (3) \nand \nOT ( T bTNN~ - 02T \nO--t = rTT 1 + (4) KT KT ] I)T OX 2' \nwhere rN and rT are maximum growth rates of normal cells and tumor cells (i.e., the net result \nof tumor cell doubling minus tumor cell loss from apoptosis or necrosis); KN and g T denote the \nmaximal normal and tumor cell densities; bgT and bTN are the lumped competition terms; ON \nand DT are cellular diffusion (i.e., migration or invasion) coefficients. The biological significance \nof the competition terms should be clarified: bTN is a lumped, phenomenological term which \nincludes a variety of host defenses including the immune response, and bNT is the negative \neffects of tumor on normal tissue such as tumor-induced extracellular matrix breakdown and \nmicroenvironmental changes. It can be shown that the results of the analysis of these equations \nremain valid even when multiple subpopulations of tumor and normal cells are considered [12]. \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nThis system in equations (3) and (4) fulfills the above criterion that, in the absence of tumor \ncells, normal tissue achieves a stable, nonzero, steady state. Furthermore, it can exhibit solutions \nof the form in equation (1) in which one population can invade the other. Specifically, the model \nyields the following final steady states [8]: \nI N = 0,  T = 0: this trivial solution is an unconditionally unstable state and hence is \nbiologically irrelevant. \nI I  N = KN, T = 0: this corresponds to normal, healthy tissue with no tumor cells present. \nRegardless of the starting point, the system always evolves to this state if both bTNKN\/K  T \n> 1 and bNTKT\/KN < 1. If the starting point is sufficiently close to N = KN, T : 0 (as \nwould occur in early tumor development), only the former condition need be satisfied. \n342 R.A. GATENBY e$ al. \nI I I  N -- 0, T = KT: this corresponds to complete tumor invasion with total destruction of \nadjacent normal tissue. Regardless of the starting point, the system always evolves to this \nstate if both bNTKT\/KN :> 1 and bTNKN\/KT \"( 1. If the starting point is sufficiently \nclose to N = O, T = KT (as would occur when tumor treatment is initiated), only the \nformer condition need be satisfied. \nIV  N = (KN -- bNTKT)\/(1 -- bNTbTN), T = (KT -- bTNKN)\/(1 -- bNTbTN): this corresponds \nto tissue composed of tumor and normal cells, for example, desmoplastic tumor. The \nsystem evolves to this state if both bNTKT\/KN < 1 and bTNKN\/KT < 1. One limitation \nof this model is that if the carrying capacities KN and KT are limited only by available \nspace, this state of coexistence is biologically unphysicai because it violates the spatial \nconstraint sum-rule that N\/KN + T \/KT  _< 1. There are, however, models more elaborate \nthan Lotka-Volterra having a state of coexistence not violating this spatial constraint \nsum-rule [13]. \nThe case of an invasive cancer with the tumor edge advancing as a propagating wave into \nnormal tissue would correspond to a transition to a stable steady state containing tumor ( I I I  \nor IV)  with or without normal tissue. From the above, it is clear that an invasive cancer which \ninitially arises from one or a small number of transformed cells (i.e., N = (1 -e )KN and T = ~KT, \nwith e < 1) must satisfy both inequalities in I I I .  \nUsing marginal stability analysis [12], it can be shown that the propagation speed of state I I I  \ninto state I I  (i.e., the tumor wave front into the normal host tissue) is given by \neT--.N ~ 2 rTDT 1 KT \" (5) \nFurthermore, maldng the biologically plausible assumption that carrying capacities for normal \nand tumor cells are not substantially different, the inequalities required for state I I I  stability will \nhold only if bNT is large, and bTN is small, i.e., the presence of tumor has a significantly adverse \neffect on the normal cell population but not vice versa. The most obvious contribution to bNT \ncomes from the fact that tumor cells consume much more resources than do normal cells [14,15]. \nEquation (5) is in the form of an inequality because the marginal stability analysis provides \nonly a minimum velocity. The actual velocity is dynamically selected by the system based on the \nwidth of the tumor interface at the initial time, i.e., T(x , t  = 0). If the tumor drops off faster \nthan e x p [ - ~  x] as it progresses into the normal tissue, the minimal c in equation (5) will \nbe selected [15]. Recent numerical work by Hosono [16] has indicated that the front propagation \nvelocity given by the approximation (5) holds except for the case when interspecific competition is\nstronger than intraspecific ompetition (i.e., bNTbTN ~> 1). In that case, the velocity is sensitive \nto all parameters within the model. However, because the relaxation to the asymptotic velocity \nis algebraically slow [17], numerical simulations may be biased by early-time transients or an \ninsufficiently steep initial profile. \nAnother possible significant contribution to bNT is the acidic intercellular pH in tumors that \nresults from their preferential reliance on glycolytic metabolic pathways. We have previously \nshown that excess H + ions will diffuse away from the tumor producing an unfavorable microen- \nvironment for the normal cells at the tumor-host interface [7]. Other factors contributing to bNT \ninclude extracellular matrix breakdown by tumor produced proteinases and normal cell crowding \nby increased interstitial pressure in tumors. \nFully successful tumor therapy requires the system parameters be changed to yield steady \nstate I I  instead of I I I  or IV. This will essentially reverse the traveling wave so that normal \ntissue (which in this case becomes the stable steady state) will propagate into tumor (now the \nunstable steady state) causing the latter to completely regress. Assuming that tumor has already \ndeveloped as a traveling wave, successful therapy will at minimum, require that \nbTNKN \n> 1. (5) \nAnalysis of Tumor 343 \nEnsuring the complete radication of the tumor will require that the state N = KN, T -~ 0 be \nglobally stable so that, in addition to (6), the condition for state I I  global stability must be met \nas well \nbNTKT \n- -  < 1. (7 )  gg \nIf conditions (6) and (7) are met, the normal tissue would recover at a speed [7] given by \nCN--*T ~ 2 rNDN 1 --~N ]\" (8) \nBy \"recovery of normal tissue\", we do not mean to imply that the segment of organ destroyed \nby the invading malignancy will regenerate o its initial state. In fact, the reverse traveling wave \nwill almost certainly not contain the original epithelial cell populations of the tissue since these are \ntypically terminally differentiated with proliferative potential maintained in only a small number \nof stem cells. Rather, we expect he wave of normal tissue will typically contain fibroblasts and \nother mesenchymal cells similar to the ingrowth of normal tissue in the wound healing process. \nThis would result in the residual fibrosis that is in fact observed to a variable degree in the sites \nof tumors that have regressed completely following therapy [18]. \nTwo clinically relevant insights are immediately clear from this analysis. \n1. Cytotoxic therapies will transiently reduce tumor size by reducing T but do not alter \nthe basic system dynamics. Therefore, the model predicts that cytotoxic approaches will \ninvariably fail because the tumor population will recover (i.e., OT remains > 0) unless \ntherapy reduces T to zero (i.e., all tumor cells are destroyed). \n2. Therapies aimed at reducing the tumor proliferation ra te  (rT) will never eradicate the \ntumor because rT does not appear in the critical terms determining the steady state to \nbe reached by the system. The model predicts that such therapies may slow invasion (see \nequation (5)) but will never alter the final outcome. \nIn considering successful therapeutic strategies, the above mathematical model of tumor-host \ninteraction focuses attention on four critical parameters: bTg and KT, the competition term and \ncarrying capacity of tumor, and bNT and KN, the competition term and carrying capacity of the \nnormal tissue surrounding the tumor. The model explicitly demonstrates that any therapy must \nbe viewed in a context hat includes measurements of effects on tumor and adjacent normal cells. \nTherapeutic strategies, therefore, should include the following. \n1. Reduce KT. A clear method for reducing the carrying capacity for the tumor population is \ndecreasing vascularity. This indicates that recent interest in anti-angiogenic drugs is well \nfounded [14]. Two caveats, however, must be added. First, if the reduction in angiogenesis \nalso affects normal tissue, then the therapy may also reduce KN and the inequalities in \nequation (6) or (7) may not be satisfied. Second, if bNT ~ 1, then a several-fold reduction \nin KT may be insufficient to suitably alter the stability of the steady states. \n2. Reduce bNT and increase bTN. This demonstrates the need for experimental data that \nquantifies the relative contribution of various mechanisms (e.g., tumor acid or protease \nproduction) to the lumped competition term bNT in vivo. Similar quantification of com- \nponents of bTN (e.g., immunological response) is also required. If we can estimate the \nvalue of bNT, both the identification of potential therapeutic approaches and quantifica- \ntions of their expected effect on the propagating wave of tumor invasion can be obtained. \nFor example, therapy could be directed toward decreasing the uptake and utilization of \nsubstrate by tumor cells, increasing the avidity of substrate uptake by normal cells or \nreduction of tumor acid and protease production. The role of each of these therapeu- \ntic strategies, however, must be understood in the context of the mathematical models. \nEmpiric therapy should be replaced by explicit measurement of the expected effect of the \n344 R.A. C-ATENBY el: al. \n3. \ntherapy on bNT and bTN SO that  the degree to which the therapy must change the targeted \nmechanism to alter the overall system dynamics is known prior to in it iat ion of t reatment .  \nIncrease Kw.  This is tumor  therapy directed expl ic it ly towards normal  cells. Presumably,  \nthe max imum density of normal  cells is ordinar i ly  dependent on cell-cell interact ions rather  \nthan substrate  l imitat ion. The mathemat ica l  model predicts that  therapy that  decreases \ncontact inhibit ion in normal  cells by increasing KN could reverse the inequal i ty in (5), \npossibly result ing in tumor  regression. \nCONCLUSION \nWe use an \"inverse problem\" approach to develop a simple phenomenological  mathemat ica l  \nmodel  of tumor  invasion sufficiently robust to encompass the observed behavior of the tumor-host  \ninterface. By examining the result ing state equations, we are able to identify crit ical parameters  \nthat  must  be altered for successful therapy. Our goal in this s tudy was to present a general \noverview of the dynamics of the tumor-host  interface and of possible related cancer therapeut ic  \nstrategies. The model  employed was therefore del iberately chosen for s impl ic i ty using lumped \ninteract ive terms rather than a more comprehensive model  expl ic it ly including all possible mech- \nanisms affecting the tumor-host  interface. For this reason, only very general conclusions can be \nobta ined with l imited predict ive information regarding specific cancer therapies. However, it does \nseem clear even from this approach that  t radi t ional  cancer t reatment  with systemic chemother-  \napy should be reconsidered. Specifically, we show that  cytoreduct ive agents will invar iably fail \nto cure cancer unless they reduce tumor  populat ion density to zero. Since most t ransformed \npopulat ions are heterogeneous and capable of evolving into drug resistant phenotypes,  complete \neradicat ion by cytotoxic agents is general ly unlikely. The flaw in this approach is the failure to \nalter the key parameters  in the state equations leaving OT > 0 whenever T > 0. We propose \nthat  therapies directed at changing these parameters  (as outl ined above) in conjunct ion with \ncytoreduct ive agents will yield results that  are far more positive. \nDespite their  l imitat ions, we believe that  mathemat ica l  models are essential to gain clinical \nunderstanding of the complex, nonl inear processes that  govern tumor  invasion and may be used \nto understand the strengths and weaknesses of existing cancer therapies and to predict  new \nt reatment  strategies. \nREFERENCES \n1.
