Many gases of interest have strong absorption lines\nin the 2\u20135 \u0001m region, where the InGaAsSb material system\nis proving successful.1,2 Threshold current densities as low as\n58 A cm\u22122 per quantum well \u0001QW\u0002 for devices emitting at\n2.24 \u0001m and 66 A cm\u22122 per QW at a wavelength of\n2.26 \u0001m have been achieved,3,4 while continuous-wave\nmaximum output powers of 500 mW near 2.3 \u0001m have been\nrecorded.5\nPreviously, investigations of the variation in spontaneous\nemission characteristics with temperature have successfully\nbeen used to examine and optimize the properties of near-\ninfrared semiconductor lasers for optical fiber\ncommunications.6,7 The application of these techniques to\nmidinfrared lasers will aid the development of these particu-\nlar devices and further the overall understanding of this ma-\nterial system. In this letter, we investigate the carrier\nrecombination processes occurring in 2.37 \u0001m\nInGaAsSb\/AlGaAsSb lasers, over a wide temperature range\nfrom 80 to 300 K and using high hydrostatic pressures up to\n8 kbar. From these data we identify the dominant recombi-\nnation paths constituting the threshold current of the devices\nand the extent to which each process influences their tem-\nperature dependence.\nThe triple quantum well lasers under investigation were\ngrown by solid-source molecular beam epitaxy on GaSb sub-\nstrates.

Standard photolithography\ntechniques were used to fabricate lasers with a 100 \u0001m-wide\nmetal contact stripe. The p and n contacts consist of Pt\/Au\nand a thick gold layer deposited, respectively.8 Fabry-P\u00e9rot\nlasers were measured as-cleaved with a cavity length of\n1 mm.\nIn order to collect the spontaneous emission from the\ndevice, a 100 \u0001m diameter circular window was milled in\na\u0002Electronic mail: k.o\u2019brien@surrey.ac.uk\n0003-6951\/2006\/89\u00025\u0001\/051104\/3\/$23.00 89, 05110\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject tothe n contact, using a focused ion beam. This enables one to\ncollect pure spontaneous emission which has been unaffected\nby gain or loss along the cavity. Further details of the tech-\nnique can be found elsewhere.6 The emitted spontaneous\nemission was collected using a chalcogenide \u0001As2S3\u0002 optical\nfiber, which has low loss over this wavelength range. This\nfiber was coupled into a liquid-nitrogen-cooled InSb detec-\ntor, which was also used to measure the facet emission from\nthe devices. The lasers were operated in pulsed mode at a\nduty cycle of 2% with a 1 \u0001s long pulse, to minimize Joule\nheating effects. The devices were mounted in a spring clip\ninside a static exchange gas liquid nitrogen cryostat.\nThe threshold current density of the triple QW device\nwhich is 126 A cm\u22122 \u000142 A cm\u22122\/QW\u0002 at room temperature\n\u0001RT\u0002 is considerably lower than that of a typical near-\ninfrared \u0001NIR\u0002 device emitting at 1.5 \u0001m, as plotted in Fig.\n1\u0001a\u0002. The optical losses are also low, at \u00054 cm\u22121 at RT.8 The\ntemperature dependence of the NIR device has been shown\nto be influenced primarily by Auger recombination account-\ning for 80% of its threshold current at RT.6 In fact, the wave-\nlength and temperature dependence of the threshold current\nin NIR devices, as shown in Fig. 1, is attributable to the band\ngap dependent nonradiative Auger recombination process.9\nAs the band gap decreases in the MIR wavelength range, we\nwould expect the threshold current density to increase\nsharply with increasing wavelength, following the Auger\ndominated trend of Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002. However, the low threshold\nmeasured for the 2.37 \u0001m device can be explained firstly by\nthe reduction in the band gap, Eg, since the radiative current,\nJrad\u0002Eg\n2\n,\n10\nsuggests that Jrad of the 2.37 \u0001m device should be\n40% that of the 1.5 \u0001m device. Jrad of the 1.5 \u0001m device is\nknown to constitute 20% of its 250 A cm\u22122 threshold current\ndensity, hence we would expect Jrad of the 2.37 \u0001m device to\nbe \u000520 A cm\u22122. As Jth is \u000320 A cm\u22122 we must consider\nnonradiative processes which influence the threshold current\nof the device from an analysis of the spontaneous emission\ncharacteristics.\nIn the absence of leakage paths, the current I flowing\nthrough the laser may be written as\n\u00a9 2006 American Institute of Physics4-1\n AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/apl.aip.org\/apl\/copyright.jsp\n051104-2 O\u2019Brien et al.

A, B, and C are the coeffi-\ncients referring to the three main recombination processes of\nmonomolecular \u0001through defects and impurities\u0002, radiative,\nand Auger recombination. Over a limited current range, we\nmay write that I\u0002nZ with Z=1, 2, or 3 corresponding to\ndominant monomolecular, radiative, or Auger recombination,\nrespectively. The measured spontaneous emission L is pro-\nportional to the radiative current, thus L\u0002Bn2. Hence, if B is\nindependent of n, we may write that n\u0002L1\/2 from which it\nfollows that I\u0002 \u0001L1\/2\u0002Z. Therefore, the value of Z close to\nthreshold, Zth, can be obtained by taking the slope of a plot\nof ln\u0001I\u0002 against ln\u0001L1\/2\u0002.6 Plotting Zth as a function of tem-\nperature \u0003Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002\u0004, we see that Zth\u00053 at RT, hence if leak-\nage is not important \u0001as we will show later from high pres-\nsure measurements\u0002 this suggests that Auger recombination\n\u0001\u0002n3\u0002 is the primary current path, while at low temperature\nZth reduces to approximately 2, indicating that radiative re-\ncombination \u0001\u0002n2\u0002 is dominant. The measured spontaneous\nlight versus current curve shows a pinning of the spontane-\nous emission at the lasing threshold, as additional injected\ncarriers take part in the stimulated emission process. The\npinning level Lpin is proportional to the radiative current Jrad.\nAs there is no evidence of monomolecular recombination,\nFIG. 1. \u0001a\u0002 Temperature dependence of the threshold current density per\nQW for 1.5 and 2.37 \u0001m devices and \u0001b\u0002 variation of the normalized thresh-\nold current density with lasing energy Elase using high pressure techniques to\nvary the band gap energy of several near-infrared lasers, as previously pub-\nlished by Sweeney \u0001Ref. 9\u0002.which would appear as a region with Z=1 at low currents\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject towhere n is small,11 we can assume that the threshold current\nat low temperature is purely radiative and hence determine\nthe magnitude of the radiative current over the temperature\nrange from the variation of Lpin. At RT we calculate that the\nthreshold current of these lasers consists of 20% radiative\ncurrent and 80% nonradiative current, as shown in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002.\nInterestingly, although this is large, its relative contribu-\ntion is no greater than is observed in the much larger band\ngap GaInAs\u0001P\u0002 \/ InP lasers operating at 1.5 \u0001m.6 This may be\nexplained by the fact that the spin-orbit splitting energy \u0004so\nis greater than the band gap for the 2.37 \u0001m material. Hence,\nthe CHSH Auger process \u0001which involves the recombination\nof a conduction band electron with a heavy hole and the\nsubsequent excitation of another heavy hole into the spin-\norbit split-off band\u0002, which dominates 1.5 \u0001m lasers, is sup-\npressed. This is also evident in the RT pressure measure-\nments above 8 kbar, discussed below. However, other Auger\nrecombination processes must be considered, such as CHCC,\nwhere the recombination of a conduction band electron and a\nheavy hole is followed by the excitation of another conduc-\ntion band electron to higher energy in the conduction band\nand CHHL, where the recombination of a conduction band\nelectron and a heavy hole is followed by the excitation of\nanother heavy hole deep into the light hole band.

Thus, we can use pressure\nto investigate band gap dependent processes. Figure 3 shows\nthe pressure \u0001band gap\u0002 dependence of the threshold current\nof the 2.37 \u0001m devices at RT \u0001squares\u0002 and at 313 K \u0001tri-\nangles\u0002. The decrease of Ith with pressure in both cases may\nbe attributed to the decrease in the Auger coefficient C with\nincreasing band gap. Additional support for this can be seen\nfrom room temperature high pressure measurements carried\nout by Adamiec et al. \u0001inset of Fig. 3\u0002 which show a strong\nincrease in Ith above 8 kbar.12 At these higher pressures Eg\napproaches \u0004so and the CHSH process becomes resonant. An\nincrease in inter-valence band absorption may also contribute\nto this strong increase in the threshold current.13 We believe\nthat carrier leakage plays no role since we estimate that in\nthis structure, the conduction band offset \u0004Ec\u0005370 meV\nand the valence band offset \u0004Ev\u0005160 meV,14,15 which are\nboth large compared with kT at room temperature.

Significant improvements in\ndevice performance have been achieved through improved\ndesign of lasers in this material system, in fact these devices\nhave particularly low internal losses of 4 cm\u22121 at RT.
