It is\nimportant in its own right and it mediates other\npositive outcomes, including adherence to\ntreatment.1 Recent changes to the organisation and\ndelivery of primary care in the UK have the potential\nto reduce continuity of care markedly,2 as patients\nare increasingly likely to be consulting unfamiliar\nhealth professionals. It is not clear how this will have\nan impact on patient trust.\nThe limited research on the association between\ncontinuity and trust suggests that trust is promoted\nby the quality of the GP\u2013patient relationship, and in\nparticular the interpersonal aspects of the GP\u2019s care\nof the patient.3\u20136 There is a need to determine\nwhether and how the longitudinal aspects of the\nGP\u2013patient relationship affect patient trust.\nThis study uses a theoretical framework\n(behavioural game theory) as a basis for predictions\nabout the specific aspects of continuity that\npromote trust.7 Game theory indicates that trust is\npromoted when people interact with each other\nrepeatedly, and particularly when individuals are\naware of their partners\u2019 cooperativeness on past\noccasions (either from personal experience or\nreputation), have a reputation for cooperativeness\nthemselves, and anticipate ongoing interactions in\nthe future \u2014 described as the \u2018shadow of the\nfuture\u2019.8 Hence, game theory points to information\nabout past cooperativeness, and an expectation of\nfuture interactions, as important determinants of\ntrust.\nThis study aimed to test whether these\ndimensions of continuity, identified from game\ntheory, are associated with patients\u2019 trust in GPs.\nMETHOD\nA questionnaire was developed and piloted prior to\nuse. The questionnaire included a series of\nquestions on aspects of continuity, devised specially\nfor this study. These questions were based on\nspecific hypotheses derived from the framework of\nbehavioural game theory. The questions on\ncontinuity consisted of statements accompanied by\nC Tarrant, BSc, PhD, Wellcome Trust postdoctoral researcher,\nDepartment of Health Sciences; AM Colman, BA, MA, PhD,\nFBPsS, professor of psychology, School of Psychology, University\nof Leicester, Leicester.

Evidence of cooperativeness in\nthe past was assessed by the questions \u2018This GP\nhas always given me the best possible treatment or\nadvice in the past\u2019 and \u2018This GP knows, or has\nchecked, whether I have followed the treatment or\nadvice recommended on past occasions\u2019.\nAnticipation of the future was assessed by the\nquestion \u2018This GP will follow up my progress in the\nfuture\u2019. The questionnaire measured interpersonal\ncare through the use of a single subscale from the\nGeneral Practice Assessment Survey (GPAS)\nquestionnaire (the \u2018interpersonal care\u2019 subscale),9\nconsisting of three questions asking patients to rate\nthe amount of time the GP spent with them, the GP\u2019s\npatience, and caring and concern (Appendix 1,\nquestion 9). Trust was measured using the short\nform Interpersonal Trust in Physician Scale,10 which\nproduces a trust score out of 100 (Appendix 1,\nquestion 10). The questionnaire was pretested\nthrough a postal pilot study involving 50 patients in\na single GP practice, to assess response patterns\nand identify questions with very skewed responses\nor a large number of missing responses. Participants\nwere asked for feedback on the content of the\nquestionnaire. The questionnaire was revised as a\nresult of this piloting.\nThe questionnaire was posted to a sample of 593\npatients from three Leicestershire general practices\n(Appendix 2), in March and April 2005. Sample size\nwas calculated from published guidelines for\nmultiple regression analysis.11 Patients who had\nconsulted at the practice over the past 2 weeks\nwere selected at random from practice records, after\nexcluding patients aged <18 years and >75 years.\nData were analysed in SPSS using t tests, Pearson\u2019s\nand point-biserial correlation, and multiple linear\nregression analysis (method: Enter).\nRESULTS\nThe questionnaire was returned by 279 patients\n(47%). Thirty-six patients did not see a GP at their\nmost recent visit, but saw a practice nurse. These\nquestionnaires were excluded, leaving 243\nquestionnaires for analysis. Characteristics of\nresponders are given in Table 1.\nThe results of multiple regression analysis are\nshown in Table 2. Although patients who saw their\nusual GP had significantly higher trust scores than\nthose who did not (83.5 compared to 72.6, t = 3.53,\nP = 0.001), this did not emerge as an independent\npredictor of trust. Interpersonal care was the\nstrongest predictor of trust. Good care from the GP\nin the past, belief that the GP knew or had checked\nwhether the patient had followed the treatment or\nadvice recommended on past occasions, and the\npatient\u2019s expectation that the GP would provide\nfollow-up care in the future also emerged as\nsignificant independent predictors of trust.\nThe impact of patients\u2019 expectations of future care\nfrom the GP is underlined by the finding that\npatients who reported that the GP had asked them\nto come back and see him\/her specifically in the\nfuture had higher trust scores than patients who had\nnot been asked this by the GP (mean trust scores:\n86.06 and 67.09 respectively, t = 5.65, P<0.001).\nDISCUSSION\nSummary of main findings\nInterpersonal care, information about past\ncooperation, and expectation of continuing care\nHow this fits in\nPatient trust is an important feature of primary care that may be threatened by\nreduced continuity of care resulting from new modes of delivery such as\npolyclinics. This study shows that positive ratings of a GP\u2019s interpersonal care,\nexperiences of mutual cooperation between patient and GP in the past, and\npatients\u2019 expectations of continuing care from the same GP in the future are all\nassociated with higher patient trust. This suggests that continuity of care and\nexpectation of care from the same GP in the future are important in promoting\npatient trust.\nOriginal Papers\n781\nBrief Re o t\nCharacteristic n (%)\nMean age, years (range, SD) 50.0 (18\u201375, 15.84)\nSex\nMale 84 (34.6)\nFemale 157 (64.6)\nEthnicity,\nWhite British 202 (83.1)\nWhite other 12 (4.9)\nIndian 14 (5.8)\nPakistani 3 (1.2)\nBlack African\/Caribbean 4 (1.6)\nOther 1 (0.4)\nEmployment status\nEmployed 117 (48.2)\nRetired 60 (24.7)\nUnable to work due to illness 24 (9.9)\nLooking after family 17 (7.0)\nOther 19 (7.8)\nHealth status\nExcellent 17 (7.0)\nVery good 49 (20.2)\nGood 81 (33.3)\nFair 64 (26.3)\nPoor 28 (11.5)\nLongstanding illness\nYes 135 (55.6)\nNo 105 (43.2)\nSD = standard deviation.\nTable 1. Characteristics of responders\n(n = 243).\nBritish Journal of General Practice, November 2008782\nfrom their GP in the future were all independent\npredictors of trust. Overall, these findings are in line\nwith game theory predictions that positive\nexperiences in past interactions (or evidence of past\ncooperative behaviour), and the \u2018shadow of the\nfuture\u2019, promote trust.\nStrengths and limitations of the study\nThe following study limitations are noted. First, the\nsurvey involved a relatively small number of patients\nfrom three Leicestershire general practices, and the\nresponse rate was relatively low. Due to the method\nof sampling used, the sample may be over-inclusive\nof patients who had consulted full-time as opposed\nto part-time GPs. The percentage of female\ncompared to male responders was relatively high,\nalthough this is common in surveys of primary care\npatients. Hence, the sample may not be fully\nrepresentative of the population of the practices\ninvolved, and the generalisability of the findings may\nbe correspondingly limited. Second, although\nsignificant findings emerged on the relationship\nbetween continuity and trust, it should be\nemphasised that this is a cross-sectional study, and\nit is not valid to infer causality from the findings.\nComparison with existing literature\nPatients\u2019 rating of interpersonal care in the\nconsultation was the strongest predictor of trust, as\nidentified by previous research.3\u20136,12,13 Patients also\nhad higher trust when they had experienced good-\nquality care in the past and when they felt the GP\nknew them to be a cooperative patient; previous\nresearch has reported that positive shared\nexperiences in the past have an impact on trust.3,14\nPatients also had higher trust when they believed\nthe GP would follow them up in the future. Although\ntrust has been conceptualised as \u2018forward looking\nand reflect[ing] a commitment to an ongoing\nrelationship\u2019,15 this study is the first to provide\nempirical support for the association between\nanticipation of future care and trust.\nSeeing the \u2018usual GP\u2019 did not emerge as an\nindependent predictor in the regression analysis.\nThe findings of this study indicate that trust is\nnuanced and is based on a range of evidence\nsuggesting trust is warranted, including\ninterpersonal aspects of the consultation, evidence\nof good care in the past, and evidence of\ncommitment to future care. These findings suggest\nthat seeing the \u2018usual GP\u2019 in itself is not sufficient to\npromote trust, but is likely to have value in that it\nprovides an opportunity for past interactions to be\njudged as cooperative,3 and for future interactions to\nbe anticipated with more certainty.\nImplications for clinical practice and future\nresearch\nThe study findings merit exploration and\ndevelopment. The key finding is that longitudinal\nelements of continuity have an impact on patient\ntrust, over and above the influence of the GP\u2019s\ninterpersonal skills. Further empirical work should\nbe undertaken to confirm this finding, and to test\nand explore \u2018anticipation of the future\u2019 as a\ndimension of continuity. Future research aiming to\ndefine and measure continuity should take note of\nthe conceptualisation of continuity provided by\ngame theory.\nThe study has important implications for practice.\nAlthough trust can be engendered outside of\nongoing GP\u2013patient relationships, the aspects of\ncontinuity of information and experience that were\nfound to promote patient trust are more likely to\nfeature when care is given by the same GP over\ntime. This suggests that the current trend towards\nincreased access and choice in primary care, at the\nexpense of ongoing interpersonal continuity, may\nundermine patient trust. Ways of minimising this in\nprimary care could include encouraging GPs to ask\npatients to come back to see them again personally,\nand putting practice systems in place to ensure that\nthis is made easy for the patient (for example,\nflexible appointment booking systems). However, it\nshould also be recognised that the shift towards\nproviding primary care through alternative services,\nsuch as walk-in centres and polyclinics, may mean\nthat opportunities for GPs and patients to build\ncommitted partnerships over time are lost.\nFunding body\nThis study was partly funded through a grant from the\nUniversity of Leicester Faculty of Medicine and Biological\nSciences Research Committee\nC Tarrant, AM Colman and T Stokes\nStandardised\nCorrelation with regression coefficient\nStandardised trust scorea (95% CI)\nUsual GP?
