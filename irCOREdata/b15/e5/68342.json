Scope: survey. Level: general reader.\nWhere are we going, and what is the future awaiting mankind in a few decades or centuries\nfrom now? How can we hope to influence the directions in which science and society will\nevolve? In seeking answers to these questions, Stanley Schmidt considers how we got to\nwhere we are and the nature of technological innovation.\nSchmidt\u2019s book is built around the idea that major innovations usually arise as the\nresult of a convergence between two or more seemingly separate lines of development.\nExamples that he cites include CAT scanners (which required a coalescence of work in\nX-ray technology, computing, and medicine), aviation (fluid dynamics, engine technology,\nmaterials), digital photography (optics, electronics, computing) and many others. In\ndiscussing where we may be going, he looks for emerging research lines that appear to\nhave the potential for nearly universal applicability. He pays particular attention to\nnanotechnology which, according to its most enthusiastic advocates, is indeed likely to\nchange our world with applications in areas as diverse as medicine, materials and space\nexploration.\nThe style is friendly and chatty, and the level of the presentation is suited to the\ngeneral reader with little or no science education beyond school and whatever he or she\nmay have picked up from newspaper articles and television programmes. A physicist by\nbackground, Schmidt provides simple explanations of numerous processes, phenomena\nand scientific\/technological topics, including computing, skyscraper design, aerodynam-\nics, genetics, biotechnology, information technology, nanotechnology and cognition. He\nalso skirts around the problems of consciousness, awareness and individual identity. He\nincludes much history of science, e.g. describing what modern computing owes to a piece\nof eighteenth century textile machinery, the Jacquard loom. Schmidt is also a writer and\neditor of science fiction so, unsurprisingly, his book is full of interesting and challenging\nideas, some of which will be new for almost every reader. He emphasises the potential\nfor both good and ill that arises from almost every scientific innovation, and he discusses\nthe pivotal policy choices to be made, e.g. in terms of privacy and other individual rights,\nnecessitated by recent and forseeable advances in information technology and surveillance.\nPeter V.
