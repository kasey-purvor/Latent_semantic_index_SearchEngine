We report that Ctf18, Ctf8, and Dcc1, the subunits of a Replication Factor C-like \ncomplex, are essential for the perinuclear positioning of telomeres. In both yeast and \nmammalian cells peripheral nuclear positioning of chromatin during G1 phase \ncorrelates with late DNA replication. We find that the mislocalized telomeres of ctf18 \ncells still replicate late, showing that late DNA replication does not require peripheral \npositioning during G1. The Ku and Sir complexes have been shown to act through \nseparate pathways to position telomeres, but in the absence of Ctf18 neither pathway \ncan act fully to maintain telomere position. Surprisingly CTF18 is not required for Ku \nor Sir4-mediated peripheral tethering of a non-telomeric chromosome locus. Our results \nsuggest that the Ctf18 Replication Factor C-like complex modifies telomeric chromatin \nto make it competent for normal localization to the nuclear periphery. \n \nIntroduction \nThe physical organization of DNA within the nucleus is related to chromatin function. \nChromosomes of higher eukaryotes occupy specific nuclear \u2018territories\u2019, and the spatial \nterritory of a chromosome frequently reflects its gene-density, with chromosomes containing \na high proportion of non-transcribed sequence located close to the edge of the nucleus \n(Tanabe et al, 2002). Although it is clear that chromatin is organized and actively positioned \nwithin the nuclear space, the mechanisms determining physical organization of chromosomes \nwithin nuclei are not understood.  \n All eukaryotic cells replicate their DNA according to a reproducible temporal \nprogram and spatial organization of the DNA is correlated with replication timing (reviewed \nin Taddei et al, 2004b). Replication foci are typically spread throughout the nuclear interior \nduring early S phase, while peripheral and perinucleolar DNA replicates in mid to late S \n 3 \nphase. Non-expressed heterochromatic DNA usually replicates late in S phase (Gilbert et al, \n2004; Woodfine et al, 2004). In general, the spatial organization, transcriptional activity and \nreplication timing of chromatin are correlated, but causative relationships between these three \nproperties are unclear. \nThe organization of the telomeres of S. cerevisiae offers a useful model system for \nstudying chromosome positioning, transcriptional activity, and replication timing. The 32 \ntelomeres of haploid yeast cells associate in 3 to 6 clusters at the nuclear periphery (Gotta et \nal, 1996). S. cerevisiae subtelomeric sequences are subject to silencing of polymerase \nII-mediated transcription (Gottschling et al, 1990) and telomeres are replicated late during S \nphase (Ferguson and Fangman, 1992; Raghuraman et al, 2001).   \nTwo partially redundant pathways have been identified that mediate tethering of \ntelomeres to the nuclear rim. The first depends on the yeast Ku (yKu) protein complex (which \nconsists of Yku70 and Yku80 proteins), and the second on the Sir4 and Esc1 proteins \n(Hediger et al, 2002; Taddei et al, 2004a). Different telomeres may differ somewhat in their \ndependence on these two pathways\u2014for example during G1, telomere VI-right (VIR) \npositioning depends primarily on the Ku pathway and telomere VI-left (VIL) primarily on the \nSir4\/Esc1 pathway (Bystricky et al, 2005). Some evidence suggests that the Ku-dependent \npathway tends to dominate during G1, while the Sir4\/Esc1-dependent tethering pathway is \ndominant in S phase (Hediger et al, 2002). The telomeres lose their peripheral localization \nduring G2 as cells prepare to enter mitosis, and perinuclear positioning is re-established in \nearly G1 phase.  However, the telomere positioning mechanism is not fully understood, and in \nparticular the molecular components that act with Ku to mediate telomere positioning are not \nknown. Identification of additional positioning components is complicated by the fact that Ku \nalso plays a key role in other telomere-specific functions including subtelomeric \ntranscriptional silencing (Gravel et al, 1998; Laroche et al, 1998), telomerase recruitment \n 4 \n(Stellwagen et al, 2003) and specification of late replication timing (Cosgrove et al, 2002). \nPeripheral localization of DNA within the yeast nucleus has been shown to reinforce \ntranscriptional silencing in a number of cases.  For example, artificial localization to the \nperiphery enhances transcriptional repression at a compromised silencer (Andrulis et al, 1998).  \nConsistently, both Ku and SIR4 are required for maximum silencing of subtelomeric genes \n(Gravel et al, 1998; Laroche et al, 1998; Palladino et al, 1993).  However, under some \ncircumstances positioning and silencing can be separated.  Repression can be maintained at an \nintact silencer that is released from the nuclear peripheral zone (Gartenberg et al, 2004), and \nat a modified version of telomere VIIL there was no correlation between proportion of \nperipherally positioned telomeres and the efficiency of silencing (Tham et al, 2001).  \nThe relationship between peripheral localization and replication timing has been less \ninvestigated. The telomeres and ribosomal DNA are localized close to the nuclear envelope \nand replicate in the second half of S phase (Raghuraman et al, 2001; A. Cosgrove & A. \nDonaldson, unpublished), suggesting that peripheral localization may favor late replication. \nMoreover, removal of Ku function leads simultaneously to delocalization and abnormally \nearly replication of telomeres (Cosgrove et al, 2002). Localization of the DNA during G1 \nphase has been proposed to be particularly crucial for correct timing control (Gilbert, 2002), \nsince the S. cerevisiae telomere late replication program is pre-established during G1 \n(Raghuraman et al, 1997). The replication program in mammalian cells is also established \nduring G1 coincident with re-positioning of DNA within the nucleus (Dimitrova and Gilbert, \n1999).  \n Replication factor C (RFC) is a five subunit \u2018clamp-loading\u2019 complex consisting of \nthe essential gene products Rfc1-5, all of which belong to the AAA+ ATPase superfamily \n(Bowman et al, 2004). RFC loads the ring-shaped PCNA polymerase clamp component of \nreplication forks. Three RFC-like complexes have been identified in which the largest subunit \n 5 \n(Rfc1) is replaced by either Rad24, Ctf18, or Elg1; RAD24, CTF18, and ELG1 are \nnon-essential genes with sequence similarity to RFC1 (reviewed in Kim and MacNeill, 2003). \nThe Elg1 and Rad24 Replication Factor C-like complexes (Elg1-RLC and Rad24-RLC) are \nimportant for genome stability and checkpoint responses, and Rad24-RLC has been shown to \nload the ring-shaped 9-1-1 complex onto damaged DNA. The Ctf18-RLC is a heptameric \ncomplex containing two extra subunits, Ctf8 and Dcc1, in addition to Rfc2-5 and Ctf18 itself. \nThe function of Ctf18-RLC remains mysterious. Disruption of either CTF18, CTF8, or DCC1 \ncauses a sister chromatid cohesion defect, but no cohesin loading defect was detected in a ctf8 \nmutant (Hanna et al, 2001; Kenna and Skibbens, 2003; Mayer et al, 2001). By analogy to \nRFC and the Rad24-RLC, the Ctf18-RLC is believed to act on a ring-shaped complex. Human \nCtf18-RLC can load PCNA in vitro, although with reduced efficiency when compared to RFC \nitself (Bermudez et al, 2003; Merkle et al, 2003; Ohta et al, 2002). It has recently been \ndemonstrated that yeast Ctf18-RLC efficiently unloads PCNA from DNA in vitro (Bylund \nand Burgers, 2005).  \nHere we show that Ctf18-RLC mediates correct positioning of yeast telomeres at the \nnuclear periphery. Despite the disruption of telomere peripheral positioning, the telomeres of \nctf18 cells replicate late in S phase, showing that peripheral positioning during G1 is not \nrequired for late replication of DNA. We propose that the Ctf18-RLC may act, through \nunloading of PCNA and\/or exchange of PCNA-like ring-shaped complexes, to establish a \nchromatin structure that is required for telomere positioning. \n \n \nResults \nThe Ctf18-RLC complex is required for perinuclear positioning of Rap1 \nTo elucidate molecular mechanisms responsible for positioning chromatin within the nucleus, \n 6 \nwe screened for new gene products involved in localizing S. cerevisiae telomeres. The screen \nwill be described in detail elsewhere; briefly, it is based on examining the subnuclear \nlocalization of the telomeric heterochromatin component Rap1. We transformed a series of \ndisruption mutants in non-essential genes with a plasmid encoding GFP-Rap1, and screened \nfor those mutants in which GFP-Rap1 localization appeared abnormal. Expression of \nGFP-Rap1 in wild-type cells (Hayashi et al, 1998) reveals several discrete dots corresponding \nto the telomere clusters (Figure 1). In unbudded and small-budded cells these dots are \npredominantly localized at the nuclear rim, as expected since telomeres are localized to the \nnuclear periphery during the early part of the cell cycle. The Ku complex is required for \ncorrect localization of telomeres. As a control for the effect of telomere localization on Rap1 \npositioning, we confirmed that the Rap1 foci were largely dispersed in a yku70 strain (Figure \n1). On examination of a ctf18 strain we found that GFP-Rap1 foci were almost completely \ndisrupted, with the Rap1-GFP signal dispersed throughout the nuclear interior (Figure 1). As \ndescribed above, the Ctf18-RLC is a seven subunit RFC-like complex that includes the gene \nproducts Ctf8 and Dcc1. We found that Rap1 foci were also dispersed in ctf8 and dcc1 \nmutants (Figure 1). The fact that the ctf18, ctf8, and dcc1 mutants all share the same Rap1 \nlocalization defect suggests that the Ctf18-RLC is essential for proper Rap1 localization to the \nnuclear periphery, rather than the effect being due to one of the gene products alone. \n Rad24 and Elg1 are the largest subunits of the two other RLC complexes. Neither \nrad24 nor elg1 mutant showed a GFP-Rap1 localization defect (Figure 1), suggesting that the \nrole in Rap1 localization within the nucleus is specific to Ctf18-RLC.  \n \nThe Ctf18-RLC is required for telomere positioning \nOne possible interpretation of the results in Fig. 1 is that the Ctf18-RLC is required for \ntelomere positioning.  To address this possibility, we tested the effects of deleting CTF18, \n 7 \nCTF8, or DCC1 on telomeres that were fluorescently tagged (Straight et al, 1996). We used a \nstrain in which a single telomere is marked by GFP fused to the lac repressor and the nuclear \nenvelope is simultaneously visualized by GFP tagging of a nuclear pore component, so that \nthe telomere is visible as a bright dot within a circle corresponding to the nuclear envelope \n(Figure 2A). In the majority of interphase wild-type cells, the telomere dot appears to touch \nthe nuclear envelope (corresponding to a distance of less than 230 nm). Telomeres VIR, VIIIL, \nand XIVL were localized at the nuclear rim in a reduced proportion of ctf18, ctf8, and dcc1 \ncells, with levels of localization similar to those of a yku70 mutant (Figure 2B). The CTF18, \nCTF8, and DCC1 gene products are therefore required for correct positioning of S. cerevisiae \ntelomeres at the nuclear periphery. \nTo test whether another peripherally localized sequence is disrupted in ctf18 cells, we \nexamined the distribution of the ribosomal DNA which is normally packaged at the edge of \nthe nucleus. Observation of the rDNA using a GFP-tagged Net1 protein (which binds the \nribosomal DNA repeats) revealed no apparent mislocalization of the rDNA (data not shown). \nNuclear structure therefore does not appear to be grossly disrupted in the ctf18 mutant.  \n \nCTF18 is required for telomere localization in G1 and S phase \nTo assess the cell cycle stages at which Ctf18 is important for telomere localization, we \nexamined telomere position in cells scored for cell cycle position according to bud size. We \nquantified the position of telomere XIVL by dividing the nucleus into three concentric zones \nof equal area (Figure 3A) as described (Taddei et al, 2004a). In this assay random telomere \npositioning would be represented by 33% of telomeres scored in each zone. In wild-type \nnuclei, telomere XIVL preferentially localizes to the outermost zone in both G1 and S phase \n(Figure 3B and Table I). In ctf18 G1 phase nuclei, the same telomere was almost randomly \npositioned (39% of telomeres in Zone 1: Figure 3B and Table I). Once ctf18 cells entered S \n 8 \nphase, the telomere remained slightly delocalized from the periphery when compared to \nwild-type, although the effect was not as severe as in G1. \u03c72 analysis confirmed that telomere \nposition during S phase in ctf18 is significantly different from that of WT and from random \ndistribution. Very similar cell cycle effects were observed for telomere VIIIL (localization to \nZone 1 in 67% of wt G1 cells, 32% of ctf18 G1 cells, 61% of wt S cells, and 49% of ctf18 S \ncells).  P values assessing the statistical significance of these results are given in Table I. We \nconclude that telomere positioning is affected by CTF18 deletion primarily in G1 phase cells, \nwith absence of Ctf18 being slightly deleterious in S phase. Overall, the telomere \ndelocalization phenotype of ctf18 is reminiscent of that described for yku70, which has been \nreported to affect the positioning of some telomeres primarily during G1 (Hediger et al, \n2002). \n We performed time-lapse analysis to examine whether delocalized telomeres in ctf18 \nnuclei can still visit the nuclear periphery. Tracings of movies showing the typical behavior of \ntelomere XIVL in wild-type and ctf18 cells are shown in Figure 3C (Movies in \nSupplementary information). In wild-type G1 phase cells (Sup_3.mpg), telomere XIVL \nremained confined within 0.2 \u00b5m of the periphery for most of the analysis. Although the \ntelomere did occasionally leave the nuclear envelope, it returned to the periphery after a short \ntime and usually remained there. In S phase, telomere movement became still more confined, \nsuggesting even more stable localization (Sup_4.mpg). These data are consistent with \nprevious observations in wild-type cells (Heun et al, 2001b). In ctf18 cells in contrast, \ntelomere XIVL was not confined to nuclear periphery but spent more time in the interior, \nparticularly during G1 phase (Sup_5.mpg). The telomere was not excluded from the edge of \nthe nucleus and did pay occasional visits to the periphery, but failed to become stably \nlocalized during those visits. Once ctf18 cells entered S phase, brief periods of telomere \npositioning at the periphery were observed, although these were still not of the duration or \n 9 \nstability seen in wild-type S phase cells (Sup_6.mpg). \n We measured the duration of localization events (Figure 3D). In unbudded and \nsmall-budded ctf18 mutant cells, periods of internal localization and brief visits to the \nperiphery were increased at the expense of stable peripheral localization periods, to the \nextent that long-term (greater than 1 minute) localization periods were almost never \nobserved. We conclude that Ctf18-RLC is important for telomere positioning in both G1 \nand S phase, and that its primary role is to permit the establishment of stable localization at \nthe nuclear periphery. \n \nTelomeres replicate at the normal time in a ctf18 mutant strain \nS. cerevisiae telomeres are normally late-replicating and are localized at the nuclear periphery. \nOur discovery of a new effector of telomere localization enabled us to investigate whether \nperipheral localization of telomeres during G1 is a prerequisite for their late replication. We \nexamined the replication program of a ctf18 strain using the dense isotope transfer technique \n(Donaldson et al, 1998). Figure 4A shows the replication programs of wild-type, ctf18 and \nyku70 mutant cells analyzed by using this method. Markers for early and late replication in S \nphase are provided by the early replication origin ARS305 and a late-replicating sequence on \nchromosome XIV that lies far from either telomere (chr XIV-int). We examined the \nreplication time of telomere VIIIL, whose perinuclear localization depends on Ctf18 as shown \nin Figure 2B. We found that telomere VIIIL replicated late in the ctf18 mutant as in wild-type \ncells (Figure 4A, left and centre panels). This result contrasts with the situation in the yku70 \nmutant in which telomere VIIIL replicated much earlier in S phase (Figure 4A, right panel). \nTo measure an \u2018average\u2019 telomere replication time, we examined the replication time of the Y\u2019 \nsequences. Y\u2019 is one of the repeated sequence elements found at more than half of yeast \ntelomeres, so that examining Y\u2019 replication time gives a good view of overall telomere \n 10 \nreplication time. Y\u2019 sequences replicated late in the ctf18 mutant as in wild-type cells. In the \nyku70 mutant, Y\u2019 sequences replicated much earlier in S phase as shown previously (Cosgrove \net al, 2002). A replication time can be assigned for a sequence as the time at which half the \nfinal level of replication has occurred, and the interval between the replication of the early and \nlate marker sequences can be taken as a measure of S phase length. In the ctf18 strain this \ninterval was 16.4 min for the experiment shown in Figure 4A, compared with 23.8 min in the \nwild-type and 19.7 min in the yku70 mutant strain. The S phase program may therefore be \nslightly compressed in the ctf18 strain. \u2018Replication index\u2019 (RI) values can be calculated to \ncompare the replication programs in different strains and adjust for differences in the speed at \nwhich cultures release from synchrony. RI values express the time of replication of each \nsequence as a proportion of elapsed S phase. Figure 4B shows the replication programs of \nwild-type, ctf18, and yku70 strains plotted according to replication index. In this format it is \nclear that there is no significant change in the relative replication time of Y\u2019 sequences in the \nctf18 strain when compared to wild-type. Analysis of two additional loci (sequences close to \nthe left ends of chromosomes III and VI) also confirmed that the RI values in the ctf18 S \nphase were very similar to wild-type, any slight differences observed lying within \nexperimental error.  \nFrom these experiments we conclude that the telomeric DNA of a ctf18 mutant \nreplicates at its normal, late time in S phase despite the aberrant subnuclear localization of the \nchromosome ends during G1 phase. Our observation of telomere delocalization combined \nwith normal replication timing in the ctf18 strain shows that peripheral positioning of \ntelomeres during G1 is not essential for their late replication. \n \nKu complex remains bound to a telomere in a ctf18 strain \nThe telomere positioning phenotype of ctf18 resembles that reported for yku70 and yku80 \n 11 \nmutants (Hediger et al, 2002). Normal telomeric replication timing in the ctf18 mutant \nsuggested that Ku binding to telomeres is intact, but we wished to test directly whether Ku is \nloaded onto telomeres in the ctf18 strain. We examined binding of Myc-tagged Yku80 protein \nto two loci in the vicinity of telomere VIR. Yku80-Myc was bound at the telomeric sequence, \nbut not to the locus 5 kb away from telomere (Figure 5A), consistent with previous studies \n(Martin et al, 1999; Roy et al, 2004). We observed no significant change in this \ntelomere-specific binding in the ctf18 mutant, showing that Ctf18 is not required for Ku \nbinding to chromosome VIR. Yku70 was required for Yku80 to bind the telomere, as \nexpected since Ku binds DNA as a heterodimer. Consistent with the observation that Ku still \nbinds telomeres in ctf18, the ctf18 mutant has only a slight defect in telomere length control \n(data not shown; Askree et al, 2004; Smolikov et al, 2004), while yku70 mutant displays a \nsevere telomere length defect (Boulton and Jackson, 1996; Porter et al, 1996).  \nWe tested whether Ctf18 itself is localized at telomeres. Immunofluorescence and in \nvivo labeling experiments gave no suggestion that Ctf18 is specifically located at telomere \nclusters (data not shown). The higher sensitivity technique of chromatin immunoprecipitation \nalso provided no evidence for Ctf18 binding specifically to telomere VIR (Figure 5B). It \ntherefore seems unlikely that Ctf18 is a structural component of a telomere peripheral \nlocalization pathway, and we believe that it is more likely to play a regulatory role. \n \nCTF18 is required for both Ku and Sir4-mediated telomere positioning pathways during G1 \nTwo molecular pathways have been described that mediate localization of telomeres. Ku \ncomplex is believed to form a link between telomeres and the nuclear envelope by binding to \nan unidentified envelope-bound component. A second pathway involves interaction of the \ntelomere-bound Sir4 protein with the nuclear envelope-bound protein Esc1. To clarify \nwhether Ctf18-RLC affects telomere positioning through the Ku pathway, through the \n 12 \nSir4-Esc1 pathway, or through a previously unidentified pathway, we studied the localization \nof telomere XIVL in a set of double mutants. This telomere was chosen for analysis because it \nrequires both Ku- and Sir4-dependent pathways for full positioning (Figure 6A); many other \ntelomeres show more complete disruption of positioning on deletion of either of the known \npathways (Hediger et al, 2002; Taddei et al, 2004a), which could obscure additional effects of \nfurther mutations.  \nTelomere XIVL positioning was random during G1 phase in the sir4 yku70 mutant \n(Figure 6A), showing that during G1 the Ku and Sir positioning mechanisms are the only \npathways involved in localizing this telomere. Either the sir4 or yku70 mutations alone \nresulted in significant peripheral positioning (Figure 6A), demonstrating that each pathway \ncan mediate some positioning independent of the other\u2014that is, in the absence of Sir4, the Ku \npathway can position telomere XIVL to some extent and vice versa. However, introducing the \nctf18 mutation in the sir4 background (Figure 6A, ctf18 sir4) resulted in completely random \ntelomere positioning, showing that without Ctf18 the Ku pathway can no longer mediate any \ntelomere positioning. Introducing the ctf18 mutation into the yku70 background also resulted \nin random telomere positioning, showing that Ctf18 is also required for the residual telomere \npositioning by the Sir pathway in the yku70 mutant. These results suggest that, at least for \ntelomere XIVL, both the Ku and Sir positioning pathways are largely dependent on Ctf18. \nThis interpretation is consistent with the observation that disruption of CTF18 leads to a more \nsevere positioning defect than either the sir4 and yku70 mutations alone (Figure 6A).  \nWe also examined the effects of the various mutations on telomere positioning \nduring S phase. In this case, the ctf18 mutant retained a significantly higher level of telomere \nXIVL positioning than the sir4 yku70 double mutant (Figure 6A). One interpretation of this \nresult might be that during S phase the Ku and Sir positioning pathways are less dependent on \nCtf18 than they are in G1. However, during S phase, significant telomere positioning \n 13 \nremained in the sir4 yku70 double mutant (Figure 6A) suggesting that an additional telomere \npositioning pathway plays a role at this cell cycle stage. It is intriguing to speculate that this \nadditional pathway could be related to S phase events such as telomere replication or \ntelomerase extension. Because the components of this additional pathway are unidentified, it \nis not possible to assess from our results whether Ctf18 is required for this novel positioning \nmechanism, or whether instead the dependence of the Ku and Sir4 pathways on Ctf18 is \naltered during S phase. Further clarification will require the identification of components of \nthe S phase-specific Ku\/Sir-independent positioning pathway. \n \nCTF18 is not required for Ku-mediated and Sir4-mediated linkage of an internal locus to the \nnuclear periphery \nThe double mutant analysis showed that, at least during G1, the Ku and Sir-mediated telomere \npositioning pathways are largely dependent on Ctf18. Taddei et al (2004a) developed a \nsystem that allows artificial tethering of an internally-located locus to the nuclear periphery. \nWe wished to examine whether localization of an internal site requires Ctf18, or whether \ninstead it can occur in the absence of Ctf18. We used a strain in which the early replication \norigin locus ARS607 is flanked by lexA operators (to permit tethering by LexA-Sir4PAD or by \nLexA-yku80-9) and by a series of lac operator sequences (to enable visualization using \nLacI-GFP) (Figure 6B). The ARS607 locus is randomly located in a strain bearing this \nlacop-lexAop-ARS607 construct if no LexA fusion protein is expressed. As described \npreviously, expression of LexA-yku80-9 leads to significant localization of ARS607 to the \nnuclear envelope (Figure 6C). The LexA-yku80-9 construct was still able to localize ARS607 \nwhen CTF18 was deleted. Similarly, the localization mediated by LexA-Sir4PAD was not \naffected in the ctf18 mutant (Figure 6D). \u03c72 analysis confirmed that the ctf18 mutation has no \nsignificant effect (Table II).  Function of the Ctf18-RLC is therefore not required for Yku80 \n 14 \nand Sir4 to bring about the peripheral localization of a chromosomal domain. We conclude \nthat tethering of an ectopic locus to the nuclear periphery by either Yku80 or Sir4PAD bypasses \nthe need for Ctf18.  \n \nDiscussion \nWe have found that the Ctf18-Replication Factor C-like Complex is critical for correct \npositioning of S. cerevisiae telomeres close to the nuclear periphery, particularly during G1 \nphase. Our findings represent the discovery of a new molecular effector of chromosome \nlocalization, and the identification of a new role for the Ctf18-RLC in intranuclear \norganization. In mutants in any of the three of the subunits unique to the Ctf18-RLC (Ctf18, \nDcc1, and Ctf8) we observed two phenotypes that indicate disrupted telomere \norganization\u2014the dislodgement of individual chromosome ends from the nuclear periphery \nand the dispersal of Rap1 from its normal localization pattern in foci within the nucleus. The \nCtf18-RLC is unique amongst the three known alternative RFC complexes in having this \nfunction in chromosome positioning.  \nThe telomere localization defect in a ctf18 mutant provided the opportunity to test one \nmodel for replication timing control. Several studies had suggested a close relationship \nbetween late replication and peripheral positioning of the DNA during G1 phase (Dimitrova \nand Gilbert, 1999; Heun et al, 2001a). In particular, deletion of the Yku70 subunit of the Ku \nheterodimer dislodges telomeres from the nuclear periphery, and simultaneously causes \naberrantly early activation of telomere-proximal replication origins during S phase (Cosgrove \net al, 2002; Laroche et al, 1998). Mutation of the Sir proteins causes a less dramatic but still \nnoticeable disruption of telomere localization, and a slight but significant advancement in \ntelomere replication timing (Stevenson and Gottschling, 1999). The ctf18 mutation clearly \nabolishes telomere localization to the nuclear periphery during G1, but we found that the \n 15 \ntelomeres of ctf18 cells replicate at their normal late time in S phase, quite unlike the aberrant \nearly telomere replication observed in a yku70 mutant. The ctf18 mutant phenotype therefore \ndemonstrates that peripheral localization during G1 is not a prerequisite for the late \nreplication of telomeres, and shows that the mechanisms of replication timing control must be \ndistinct from those controlling G1 telomere intranuclear positioning.  \nBy what mechanism does the Ctf18-RLC affect telomere positioning? This question is \ndifficult to address while the precise molecular role of the Ctf18-RLC remains unclear. ctf18 \nmutants are slightly compromised in mating-type and telomeric silencing (Suter et al, 2004), \nbut the most prominent previously reported phenotype of ctf18 is premature separation of \nsister chromatids (Hanna et al, 2001; Mayer et al, 2001; Naiki et al, 2001). We found that \ncohesin mutants show only a slight defect in telomere XIVL positioning under conditions \nwhere the sister chromatid separation defect is clear (data not shown). Moreover, not all \nmutants that affect sister chromatid cohesion compromise telomere positioning. For example, \nCHL1 is required for cohesion (Petronczki et al, 2004; Skibbens, 2004), but the chl1 mutation \ndid not compromise telomere peripheral positioning as assessed by Rap1 localization and \nanalysis of a tagged telomere (data not shown). Taking these results together, we have found \nno convincing evidence that the effect of ctf18 on telomere positioning is a consequence of \ndefective sister chromatid cohesion. \nTwo independently acting telomere positioning mechanisms have been characterized \nin budding yeast\u2014the Ku-dependent and Sir4\/Esc1-dependent pathways. Ctf18 is required for \nthe full activity of both pathways (Fig. 6A). Ctf18-RLC is not required to load the Ku \ncomplex (Figure. 5A), and chromatin fractionation experiments (not shown) gave no \nsuggestion that the association of Ku with chromatin is altered in a ctf18 mutant strain. ctf18 \nand dcc1 strains retain significant telomeric silencing (Suter et al, 2004), implying that Sir and \nRap1 loading onto telomeres (which is essential for telomeric silencing) is not severely \n 16 \ncompromised. Since it does not seem to be required to load Ku or Sir complexes, Ctf18-RLC \nmust presumably play a regulatory role to activate telomere positioning by the Ku and \nSir-dependent pathways. Ku or Sir fragments tethered to an internal locus are capable of \nre-positioning that chromosome domain in a ctf18 mutant, showing that isolated fragments \ncan bypass the need for Ctf18-RLC to activate peripheral positioning (Fig. 6). These results \nare consistent with models in which Ctf18-RLC \u2018unmasks\u2019 the inherent positioning capability \nof telomeric chromatin. The requirement for Ctf18 for localization of telomeres therefore \nprobably reflects a particular characteristic of telomeric chromatin, such as the need for a \nregulatory modification to telomeric chromatin to establish its competence for linkage to the \nperiphery. For example, a post-translational modification of  another telomeric protein (such \nas Rap1) might be required to allow linkage of telomeric heterochromatin to the nuclear \nperiphery by Ku and Sir proteins. \nThe role of Ctf18 in regulating telomere positioning is doubly mysterious since the \nCtf18-RLC is proposed to act at replication forks during S phase (see below) whereas the \nctf18 mutation is most deleterious to telomere positioning during G1 phase. It would be \ninformative to test whether the presence of Ctf18-RLC during DNA replication is required for \ntelomere positioning in the subsequent G1 and S phase. \nWhat is the relationship between the regulatory role of Ctf18-RLC in telomere \npositioning and the molecular function of RFC-like complexes? Replication Factor C itself \nloads the ring-shaped sliding clamp PCNA onto replication forks, while Rad24-RLC loads the \nring-shaped \u20189-1-1 complex\u2019. By analogy Ctf18-RLC is believed to load or unload a ring \ncomplex.  Yeast Ctf18-RLC can unload PCNA from DNA very efficiently in vitro (Bylund \nand Burgers, 2005), and PCNA unloading after DNA synthesis is the clearest suggestion for \nthe biochemical function of Ctf18-RLC (Bylund and Burgers, 2005). However, it is not \nobvious why compromised PCNA unloading should lead to either telomere depositioning or \n 17 \ndefective sister chromatid cohesion. It is noteworthy that the Ctf8 and Dcc1 subunits of \nCtf18-RLC are required for telomere positioning (Figure 2) and establishment of cohesion \n(Hanna et al, 2001; Mayer et al, 2001) but dispensable for in vitro PCNA unloading. Perhaps \nCtf18-RLC has two activities, and the apparently unrelated in vitro and in vivo observations of \nits properties reflect different aspects of its function. We suggest that PCNA unloading by \nCtf18-RLC might be coupled in vivo to another chromatin modification that is required to \nactivate the Ku and Sir telomere positioning pathways in the subsequent G1 phase. Unlike the \nPCNA-unloading step, the second, coupled step would be expected to require Ctf8 and Dcc1 \nsince these subunits are required for telomere positioning. One possibility is that the second \nactivity of Ctf18-RLC involves loading of another ring-shaped complex. \nCtf18-RLC could conceivably play a related role at other chromosomal loci\u2014for \nexample, to establish cohesin loading sites as competent for sister chromatid attachment. If so, \nCtf18-RLC might be envisaged as having a general involvement in activating particular \nproperties of specialized chromatin sites following DNA replication. It will be of interest to \ninvestigate whether the complex is involved in regulating chromosome organization within \nmammalian nuclei. \n \n \nMaterials and Methods \nYeast strains \nGene deletion collections were purchased from EUROSCARF.

The total number of scored time points was 37 for wild-type G1, 42 for wild-type S, \n50 for ctf18 G1, and 35 for ctf18 S. \n \nFigure 4. Telomeres replicate at the normal time in a ctf18 strain. Replication timing \nprograms of wild-type, ctf18, and yku70 strains were analyzed using the density transfer \ntechnique. (A) Replication kinetics of ARS305, chromosome XIV-internal, telomere VIIIL, \nand subtelomeric Y\u2019 sequences are shown for each strain. Percentage of cells that have \nreplicated the various loci is plotted against time after release from \u03b1-factor. (B) Replication \nindex values of internal (ARS305, chr XIV-internal, ARS1) and telomere-associated (Y\u2019, \ntelomeres VIIIL, VIL, and IIIL) sequences. For wild-type and ctf18 strains, the standard \ndeviation obtained in two independent experiments is indicated by horizontal error bars. For \nyku70, the density-transfer procedure was carried out only once using this synchronization \nprotocol to illustrate the effect on telomere replication timing described previously (Cosgrove \net al, 2002). \n \nFigure 5. Ku binds telomere VIR in a ctf18 mutant, and Ctf18 does not bind specifically \nto telomeres. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative PCR was used to \nexamine binding of Yku80-Myc and Ctf18-Myc to loci in the vicinity of chromosome VIR. \nHistogram keys shows the tagged protein and any further mutation in each strain examined. \n(A) Telomere binding of Yku80 in a ctf18 strain. Binding of Yku80 to telomere VIR appeared \n 27 \nsimilar in wild-type and ctf18 backgrounds. (B) Ctf18-Myc does not bind specifically to \ntelomere VIR. Amounts of DNA precipitated from Yku80-Myc and non-tagged strains in the \nsame experiments are shown as controls for telomere-specific binding.  \n \nFigure 6. The role of Ctf18 in the telomere position machinery. (A) Localization of \ntelomere XIVL was scored in the indicated mutants as in Figure 3B. The proportion of cells \nhaving the telomere positioned peripherally (in Zone 1) is plotted for each strain. Error bars \nindicate standard deviations obtained from at least two independent cultures. Dotted line \nrepresents random distribution. (B) The ARS607 localization construct used to examine Ku \nand Sir4-mediated tethering. Arrays of lacOP and lexAOP are integrated near ARS607. (C) \nYku80-mediated tethering of ARS607 to the nuclear periphery. The position of the ARS607 \nlocus in WT and ctf18 strains expressing LexA-yku80-9 fusion protein was scored as in \nFigure 3.  (D) Tethering of ARS607 mediated by Sir4PAD was examined as in panel (C).  \n 28 \nTable I  Significance of telomere localization \n P value \n WT against randoma ctf18 against randoma ctf18 against WTb \nTelomere XIVL    \nG1 2.43 x 10-16 0.08 5.34 x 10-12 \nS 2.22 x 10-21 1.09 x 10-7 2.39 x 10-3 \n    \nTelomere VIIIL    \nG1 2.65x 10-19 0.98 6.21 x 10-33 \nS 5.92 x 10-13 8.37 x 10-4 2.29 x 10-4 \naP values were calculated by \u03c72 analysis in which actual distribution was compared to a \nhypothetical random distribution. \nbP values were calculated by \u03c72 analysis in which observed distribution for ctf18 was compared \nto that for wild type. \n \n 29 \nTable II  Significance of LexA fusion-dependent tethering \n P value \n WT against randoma ctf18 against randoma ctf18 against WTb \nLexA-yku80-9    \nG1 5.28 x 10-10 2.17 x 10-12 0.18 \nS 3.15 x 10-6 6.72 x 10-6 0.13 \n    \nLexA-Sir4PAD    \nG1 5.88 x 10-5 2.01 x 10-6 0.19 \nS 7.26 x 10-6 9.07 x 10-7 0.10 \naP values were calculated by \u03c72 analysis in which actual distribution was compared to a \nhypothetical random distribution. \nbP values were calculated by \u03c72 analysis in which observed distribution for ctf18 was compared \nto that for wild type. \n \nFigure 1\nWT yku70 ctf18 ctf8\ndcc1 rad24\nBright field\nGFP (projection)\nelg1\nAB\nWT ctf18 ctf8 dcc1yku70\nBright\nField\nGFP\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n%\n N\nuc\nle\nar\n p\ner\nip\nhe\nry\nWT ctf18 ctf8 dcc1 yku70\nTelomere VIR Telomere VIIIL Telomere XIVL\nFigure 2\nBA 1\n2\n3\nWT G1 WT S\nctf18 G1 ctf18 S\nC\nWT G1 WT S\nctf18 G1 ctf18 S\ndetached\n< 1 min\n1-2 min\n2-3 min\n3-4 min\nD\nTelomere XIVL\n1 2 3 1 2 3\n90\n60\n30\n0\n%\n fo\nci\nG1 S\nWT\nctf18\nFigure 3\nAB\nWT\nctf18\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\nReplication Index\nyku70\nARS305 chrXIV-int Telomere VIIIL\nY'\nARS1\nTelomere IIIL Telomere VIL\n%\n re\npl\nic\nat\ned\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\nTime (min)\nWT\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\nctf18\nTime (min)\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80 yku70\nTime (min)\nARS305\nchrXIV-int\nTel VIIIL\nY'\nFigure 4\nA400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n-90 kb -5 kb Telomere\nYku80-Myc\nCtf18-Myc\nNo tag\nU\nni\nts\n D\nN\nA \n-5 kb Telomere\n200\n100\n0\n50\n150\nYKU80-Myc YKU80-Myc yku70\nYKU80-Myc ctf18 No tag\nU\nni\nts\n D\nN\nA \nYku80-Myc pulldown\nB\nFigure 5\nLexA-yku80-9\n1 2 3 1 2 3\n90\n60\n30\n0\n%\n Z\non\ne \n1\nG1 S\nWT\nctf18\nA\nB\nC\nWT ctf18 sir4 yku70\nctf18 sir4 ctf18 yku70 sir4 yku70\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n%\n in\n Z\non\ne \n1\nSG1\nlac lexA\nARS607\nTel VIRCEN6\n50 kb\nOP OP\n70 kb\nD\nPAD\n1 2 3 1 2 3\n90\n60\n30\n0\n%\n Z\non\ne \n1\nG1 S\nLexA-Sir4\nWT\nctf18\nFigure 6\n1 \nSupplementary materials and methods. \nPlasmids \nTo construct the YCp-GFP-RAP1 plasmid, the following fragments were ligated: (1) vector \nbackbone from YCplac33 (Gietz and Sugino, 1988) cut with XbaI and EcoRI (EcoRI end was \nfilled), (2) GFP-RAP1 coding sequence as PstI - BssHII fragment of pAH52 (Hayashi et al, \n1998), whose BssHII end was filled by Klenow fragment, and (3) promoter region of RAP1, \nPCR-amplified from W303a genomic DNA then digested at XbaI (introduced by PCR) and \ngenomic PstI sites. Plasmid pDM266 (Straight et al, 1999) was obtained from Luis Aragon \n(MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, UK).   \n \nMicroscopic techniques \nFor observations of GFP fluorescence in living yeast cells, cells were grown to log phase, \nrecovered by centrifugation, then resuspended in synthetic complete media. Cells were \nmounted on an agarose-pad.  Z stack images were taken at appropriate intervals using a \nDeltavison (Applied Precision) with 60x (NA 1.4) or 100x (NA 1.35) objectives. Out-of-focus \nhaze was removed by iterative deconvolution if required.   \nQuantitative evaluation in Figures 3 and 6 of telomere position was performed \nessentially as described (Hediger et al, 2002) except that average diameter of the nucleus in \neach strain at each cell cycle stage (G1, S, and G2) was used to calculate the size of \nconcentric zones.  P values were calculated by \u03c72 analysis as described in footnotes of Tables I \nand II. \nFor time-lapse analysis, a Zeiss Axioplan 2 equipped with ORCA-ER CCD camera \n(Hamamatsu Photonics) with 100x objective (NA 1.35) was used.  GFP and phase contrast \n2 \nimages were captured at 5-sec intervals.  ImageJ software (http:\/\/rsb.info.nih.gov\/ij\/) with \nSpotTracker plug-in (Gartenberg et al, 2004) was used to track telomere movement in Figure \n3. \nThe duration of localization periods of the telomere dot at the nuclear envelope was \nmeasured as follows: from a single-section time-lapse series of images where the telomere dot \nremained approximately in focus, the image at 90 sec was examined and telomere position \nwas scored.  If the telomere position was within 170 nm  from nuclear envelope (roughly \ncorresponds to Zone 1 in 3-zoning analysis), it was scored as \u201clocalized\u201d; otherwise \n\u201cdetached\u201d.  For the \u201clocalized\u201d telomeres, the duration of that localization event was \ndetermined by inspecting the telomere position in previous and following time points. Similar \nmeasurements were done for images at 180 sec, 270 sec, 360 sec, 450 sec, 540 sec, and 630 \nsec of all possible time-lapse image series, to obtain the data presented in Figure 3. \n \nChromatin immunoprecipitation \nThe amount of DNA immunoprecipated was measured by real-time PCR using DNA Engine \nOpticon 2 (MJ Research) and DyNamo SYBR Green qPCR kit (Finnzymes). SGD \ncoordinates of the PCR-amplified fragments are 269314 to 269487 (telomere VIR), 264646 to \n264839 (5 kb from telomere VIR), and 181173 to 181358 (90 kb from telomere VIR). \n \nAnalysis of replication timing program \nTo analyze replication timing the DNA of cell cultures was first labeled by growth in medium \ncontaining dense isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. Cultures were then synchronized in late G1 \nusing \u03b1-factor and released in medium containing light isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. \nSamples were taken throughout S phase and the genomic DNA recovered and digested with \n3 \nEcoRI before centrifugation on a cesium chloride gradient. The replication kinetics of specific \nsequences were assessed by monitoring their transition from the heavy-heavy to the \nheavy-light peak of DNA density. ARS305 and ARS1 fragments probed were as described \npreviously (Friedman et al, 1996; McCarroll and Fangman, 1988).  Fragments made by PCR \namplification of appropriate sequences were used to detect the following EcoRI fragments \n(numbers based on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Genome Database): chromosome \nXIV-internal (XIV 221459-226536); chromosome VIII-left (VIII 6461-11142), chromosome \nVI-left (VI 16430-21324); chromosome III-left (III 2052\u20136585).  A 738bp HpaII probe \nfragment containing the Y' ARS sequence was used to measure replication kinetics of the Y' \nsequence elements.  \n \nStrains \nStrains used are listed in the following strain table.  To construct ctf18::kanMX3, \nctf8::kanMX3, dcc1::kanMX3, and sir4::kanMX3 strains, orf::kanMX constructs were \nPCR-amplified from relevant EUROSCARF gene deletion strains and transferred to strains \nGA-1459, GA-1985 and GA-1986.  Other gene disruptions and epitope-tagging were \nperformed as described (Longtine et al, 1998); primer sequences available on request. \n \n \n4 \n \nTable SI.
