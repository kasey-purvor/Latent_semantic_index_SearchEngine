Substitution with glucose caused an increase in the microbial \nextracellular polymer content of the digested sludge, which altered the particle size \ndistribution of the sludge and increased the sludge dewaterability.  Substitution with \npropionic acid gave similar results to the control.  The relationship between the digested \nsludge extracted extracellular polymer yield and sludge filtrability determined using the \ncapillary suction time test was significant at the P = 0.01 level.  The level of \nextracellular polymer for optimum sludge dewaterability was calculated as 17.2 mg g-1 \nSS.  The protein and carbohydrate composition of the extracted polymer did not appear \nto affect the sludge dewaterability.  Results present will allow predictions to be made \ninto the effect that changes in the influent sewage composition has on essential \ndownstream processes. \n 2\nkey words- anaerobic digestion; dewaterability; extracellular polymer; organic \namendment; particle size distribution; sludge \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nAnaerobic digestion is currently the most common process used for sludge minimisation \nand stabilisation (Hudson and Lowe, 1996), with 50 % of the sludge produced in the \nEuropean Union being treated in this way (Hall, 1995). The process of anaerobic \ndigestion occurs in a number of discrete stages, the main ones being hydrolysis, \nacidogenesis and methanogenesis.  Each stage is dependent on a different bacterial \npopulation, with all of the separate bacterial species living together in direct or indirect \nsymbiotic associations (Gujer and Zehnder, 1983).  Prior to disposal digested sludge is \ngenerally dewatered, giving a further reduction in the sludge volume and thereby \ndecreasing disposal costs.  The reported impact of anaerobic digestion on sludge \ndewaterability to date is mixed, with some studies indicating that digestion generally \nimproves sludge dewaterability, (Rudolfs and Heukelekian, 1934; Brooks, 1970; Lawler \net al., 1986) whilst other studies have reported that digestion degrades sludge \ndewaterability (Pearson and Buswell, 1931; Karr and Keinath, 1978; Yan et al., 1987; \nHoughton et al., 2000a).   \nDuring anaerobic digestion organic debris is broken down resulting in a change in the \nparticle size distribution (Karr and Keinath, 1978; Lawler et al., 1986; Nellenschulte \nand Kayser, 1997).  The sludge particle size distribution has been shown to be one of \nthe key factors in controlling sludge dewaterability (Karr and Keinath, 1978).  Reported \ndifferences in the affect of digestion on sludge dewaterability may therefore be related \n 3\nto the biodegradability of the sludge used and differences in digester efficiency \naffecting the particle size. \nAnother parameter that can have an impact on the sludge dewaterability is the sludge \nmicrobial extracellular polymer (ECP) content (Ryssov-Nielsen, 1975; Novak et al., \n1977; Kang et al., 1989).  Microbial ECP is an organic polymer produced by bacterial \ncells and is frequently responsible for binding cells and other particulate matter together \n(Wingender et al., 1999).  Microbial ECP is highly hydrated and may contain up to 99 \n% water by weight (Costerton et al., 1981) thereby retaining a high level of water in the \nsludge.  By binding cells and particulate matter together it also changes the particle size \ndistribution of the sludge, which again affects the dewatering process. \nInvestigations into the effect of microbial ECP on digested sludge dewaterability have \nbeen limited to date.  Extraction and analysis of ECP from sludge samples obtained \nfrom both full-scale (Houghton et al., 2000a) and laboratory-scale (Houghton et al., \n2000b) anaerobic digesters has indicated a positive correlation between increasing ECP \nyield and sludge becoming more difficult to dewater, but the relationship was not \nalways significant at the P = 0.05 level. \nPoxon and Darby, (1997) found no simple relationship between the quantity of ECP \npresent and sludge dewaterability, though in this case the level of ECP present was \nquantified using an in situ dye adsorption method and the sludge dewaterability \ncalculated using a filterability index based on the capillary suction time (CST) test.  \nAny trend that was present appeared to be dependent on the digester feed composition, \nwith increased quantities of ECP associated with high carbohydrate feed.  In this case, \nthe composition of the ECP produced was not investigated.  The same trend was also \nnoticed when different individual substrates were used as feed for anaerobic digestion, \nwith glucose consistently producing a sludge with higher levels of extractable microbial \n 4\nproducts than acetate, butyrate or propionate (Noguera et al., 1994; Jia et al., 1996; Kuo \net al., 1996).  The impact on the sludge dewaterability was not determined in any of \nthese studies.   \nThe composition of the ECP also altered with the type of substrate, with ECP extracted \nfrom digested sludge fed glucose containing more protein and carbohydrate than the \nother substrates (Jia et al., 1996).  These results indicate that the acidogenic bacteria \nthat utilise glucose in the first stage of the digestion process produce more ECP than the \nacetogenic bacteria that utilise butyrate or propionate, or the methanogenic bacteria that \nutilise acetate.   \nBy adjusting the organic composition of the feed sludge to a series of laboratory-scale \nanaerobic digesters, the aim of this paper was to determine the impact that these \nalterations had on the digested sludge in terms of microbial ECP yield and composition, \nparticle size distribution and sludge dewaterability.  Simultaneous evaluation of each of \nthese sludge parameters will allow predications to be made into the effect that changes \nin the influent sewage composition has on essential downstream processes. \n \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \nDigester feed  \nThe digester feed consisted of either 100 % primary sludge or a mixture of primary \nsludge and a known quantity of either glucose or propionic acid.  Settled primary sludge \nwas collected from Saffron Walden municipal wastewater treatment works (Anglian \nWater plc., UK).  After collection, the sludge was divided into 0.5 and 1.0 l aliquots and \nblended (Phillips Type: HR2845\/AM) for 1 min, before being stored at -20 oC.  Before \n 5\nuse, the sludge was defrosted for 24 h at room temperature, followed by heating to ~ 35 \noC in a water bath.  The mean COD of the collected primary sludge was  67.6 g l-1.  \nGlucose and propionic acid solutions (0.45 M and 0.67 M respectively) containing the \nsame COD as the primary sludge were prepared and used as a substitute for a proportion \nof the primary sludge.  The initial quantity of glucose or propionic acid used in the feed \nwas 10 % by volume.  This was increased by a further 5 % by volume every other day \nuntil a final volume of 40 % was reached by day 13, after which the feed composition \nremained constant until day 40.  Seed sludge for the digesters was obtained from Milton \nKeynes municipal wastewater treatment works (Anglian Water plc., UK). \n \nExperimental set-up \nSix laboratory scale anaerobic digesters were constructed from 5 l Quickfit\u00ae \nfermentation vessels as detailed previously (Houghton et al., 2000b).  The digesters \nwere operated as matched pairs using the following feed composition: 100 % primary \nsludge; primary sludge with glucose; primary sludge with propionic acid.  Operating \ntemperature of the digesters was 35 oC at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 20 d, with \nsludge wasted\/fed once pre day.  The digesters were operated for 2 full HRT before \nbeing dismantled and the sludge analysed. \n \nExtracellular polymer extraction \nExtraction of ECP was carried out using a heat extraction process similar to that of \nMorgan et al. (1990).  Samples of sludge (500 ml) were rinsed and then re-suspended in \n0.25-strength Ringer\u2019s solution, heated to 80 oC for 1 h and cooled.  After cooling to \nroom temperature, the polymer was separated from the solid material by centrifugation \n(1800 G for 20 min followed by 5000 G for 20 min).  The extracted polymer was \n 6\nremoved from the supernatant using solvent (3 vol acetone:1 vol ethanol) precipitation, \novernight at 4 oC, followed by centrifugation at 5000 G for 20 min.  The collected \npolymer was evaporated to dryness and the yield related to the sludge suspended solids \n(SS) content. \n \nDewaterability tests \nSludge filtrability was determined using the capillary suction time (CST) test (Triton \nCST filtrability tester, model 200, Triton Electronics Ltd., Essex, UK) with standard \nfilter papers (Part No. 815095) supplied by Triton Electronics.  Each sludge was \nanalysed 5 times and the results averaged, before being standardised to a SS \nconcentration of 1 g l-1 as detailed in Standard Methods (APHA, 2000). \nSludge drainability was determined using a gravity drainage test (IWPC, 1981).  A 200 \nml sludge sample was poured into a Hartley pattern buchner funnel and allowed to drain \nunder gravity through a section of belt press filter cloth (Material: 100 % poluester; \nWire diameter: 0.35 mm warp, 0.80 mm weft; Yarn count: 40\/cm warp, 8.5\/cm weft; \nWeave type: twill; Weight: 1200 g m2; Air permeability: 2790 l m2 s-1 200 pa; Simon-\nHartley Ltd. [now discontinued]).  The volume of filtrate was measured and recorded at \n30 s intervals over a 4 min period.  Each sludge was analysed 3 times and the results \naveraged. \n \nParticle size analysis \nThe particle size distribution was determined using laser diffraction.  Analysis was \ncarried out on a Malvern Mastersizer 2000\u00ae (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, UK) \nat the following settings: stirrer speed 350; pump speed 500; ultrasonic off.   The results \nwere recorded as the particle volume percent in 70 discrete size ranges between 0.45 \n 7\nand 2000 \u03bcm.  All samples were diluted approximately 500-fold in tap water before \nbeing analysed 10 times and the results averaged to produce the particle size \ndistribution. \n \nAnalytical methods \nTotal solids (TS), volatile solids (VS) and SS were determined in accordance with \nStandard Methods (APHA, 2000).  Chemical oxygen demand and volatile acid (VA) \nconcentration were determined using HACH Methods 8000 and 8196 respectively \n(Camlab Ltd., Cambridge, UK).  Digester gas was collected over acidifed water (0.1 M \nH2SO4), and the volume produced in a set time period measured.  All gas measurements \nwere normalised to standard temperature and pressure (stp).   \nThe extracted ECP was re-suspended in distilled water at a concentration of 1 mg ml-1, \nbefore being analysed for both protein and carbohydrate content.  Protein analysis was \ncarried out using the method of Lowry et al. (1951) with bovine serum albumin as the \nstandard.  Carbohydrate analysis was carried out using the method of Dubois et al. \n(1956) with glucose as the standard.  The organic fraction of the extracted ECP was \ndetermined gravimetrically after ashing the dried ECP in a furnace at 550 oC for 4 h. \n \n \nRESULTS \nThe characteristics for each type of feed used are listed in Table 1. As part of the \nprimary sludge was substituted with glucose or propionic acid, the TS decreased.  All of \nthe digesters performed satisfactorily for the 40 d of operation, with a mean operating \ntemperature of 35.1 - 35.5 oC and a mean pH of 7.02 - 7.21 (Table 2).  The VS loading \nrate of each digester varied, depending on the feed type used.  Substituting part of the \n 8\nprimary sludge with glucose increased the VS content of the feed, whilst substitution \nwith propionic acid reduced the VS content (Tables 1 and 2). This was most apparent \nwhen propionic acid was used (Table 1).   \nThe control digesters fed 100 % primary sludge had a mean volatile solids reduction \n(VSR) of approximately 55 %.  The VSR increased to 61 - 63 % when the feed sludge \nwas partially substituted for pure glucose, and decreased to 39 - 41 % when the feed \nsludge was partially substituted for propionic acid (Table 2).  The greatest quantity of \ngas produced per g VSR occurred when propionic acid was used as part of the influent \nfeed, whereas the lowest level of gas production occurred in the control digesters fed \n100 % primary sludge (Table 2). \nThe VA content of the digester feed varied between the different treatments. The \nprimary sludge and primary sludge with glucose had similar VA concentrations at \napproximately 2,000 mg l-1, but the VA concentration of the primary sludge with \npropionic acid increased as the proportion of propionic acid increased (Figure 1).  The \nfinal concentration of VA in the primary sludge with propionic acid feed was \napproximately 20,000 mg l-1.  High levels of VA did not appear to affect the digester \noperation, with the waste sludge from each digester having VA concentrations of 12 -\n220 mg l-1. \nDigestion reduced the dewaterability of the primary sludge, both in terms of filtrability \nand drainability.  At the same time, the SS content of the sludge decreased from       \n36.8 g l-1 to 13.5 - 16.7 g l-1 (Table 3).  The final SS content of the digested sludge was \ndependent on the feed type, the highest concentration (16.4 - 16.7 g l-1) determined in \ndigested primary sludge, and the lowest concentration (13.5 - 13.6 g l-1) in digested \nprimary sludge with propionic acid. \n 9\nThe filtrability of the digesters fed primary sludge or primary sludge with propionic \nacid was similar, 6.9-8.5 s, but nearly doubled to 14.0-16.3 s when glucose was used in \nthe digester feed.  The sludge drainability results in Table 3 indicated how easy water is \nreleased from the sludge under gravity, irrespective of the solids concentration.  Prior to \ndigestion, the volume of filtrate that drained from 200 ml of primary sludge was greater, \neven though the SS concentration was more than double that of the digested sludge.  \nThe most difficult sludge to dewater by draining under gravity was the control digester \nsludge.  Supplementing a proportion of the feed with either glucose or propionic acid \nslightly improved the drainability of the sludge after digestion. \nThe organic content of the digester feed had an impact on the extracted ECP yield and \ncomposition (Table 4).  Digestion of primary sludge and primary sludge with propionic \nacid led to a reduction in the ECP yield from 19.6 mg g-1 SS to 16.3-19.2 mg g-1 SS and \n14.1-15.3 mg g-1 SS respectively.  In contrast, the ECP yield from the digested primary \nsludge with glucose increased to 24.4-25.3 mg g-1 SS.   \nDigestion of primary sludge with glucose had the greatest impact on the ECP organic \ncomposition, increasing the organic fraction from 72.8 % to 79.3-79.4 % (Table 4).  \nWhere propionic acid was used in the digester feed the ECP organic fraction decreased \nfrom 72.8 % to 68.3-71.7 % after digestion.  In all cases, the protein content of the \nextracted ECP increased after digestion from 19.9 % to 22.7-28.6 %, and the \ncarbohydrate content decreased from 21.2 % to 18.6-21.1 %.  The influence of the type \nof feed on the protein and carbohydrate content of the ECP was not conclusive.  The \ncomposition of the remaining ECP was thought to consist of nucleic acids, humic \nsubstances and lipids, but these were not assayed for in this case. \nThe particle size distribution of digested primary sludge and digested primary sludge \nwith propionic acid were similar, whereas digestion of primary sludge with glucose led \n 10\nto an overall increase in the size of sludge particles (Figure 2).  The mean particle size \nwas 17.4-21.4 \u03bcm for digested primary sludge with glucose, and 13.2-15.7 \u03bcm for the \nother feed types.  Digested primary sludge with glucose had a low sludge surface area, \n0.28-0.35 m2 g-1, compared to the other feed types, 0.38-0.46 m2 g-1.   \nIncreased sludge filtrability was related to higher levels of ECP and an increase in the \nmean particle size of the sludge, with the ECP composition having no effect.  The \nsludge drainability was not influenced by the particle size distribution nor the ECP \ncomposition, whilst the impact of the ECP yield was less in comparison to the sludge \nfiltrability. \nThe relationship between the sludge filtrability and the ECP yield was significant at the \nP = 0.01 level (Figure 3).  Increasing concentrations of ECP in the sludge initially made \nthe sludge slightly easier to filter, before further increases in ECP made the sludge \nprogressively more difficult to filter.  From Figure 3, the level of ECP that may be \nrelated to the optimum sludge filtrability was calculated as 17.2 mg g-1 SS. \nFigure 2 illustrated changes in the particle size distribution.  Examination of the mean \nD(v,0.1), D(v,0.5) and D(v,0.9) values for each sludge, i.e. the 10 %, 50 % and 90 % \ncut-off points for the distribution, showed similar results for digested primary sludge \nand digested primary sludge with propionic acid, but very different results for digested \nprimary sludge with glucose (Table 5).  Where glucose was used as part of the digester \nfeed the D(v,0.1) and D(v, 0.5) values have increased whilst the D(v,0.9) value is \napproximately half that of the other digested sludge samples.  This indicated that the \nhigh CST values obtained for the digested primary sludge with glucose were not due \nvery small particles blinding the filter paper, but the ability of the sludge to hold on to \nthe water present within the sludge. \n 11\nTo compare the effect of different ECP yields on the sludge drainability, the level of \nfiltrate removed from the digested sludge was adjusted for the different sludge SS \nconcentration as detailed in Standard Method 2710H for the time to filter test (Table 3).  \nIncreasing levels of ECP in the sludge appeared to make it harder for the water to drain \nfrom the sludge under gravity, but the relationship was not significant at the P = 0.05 \nlevel (Figure 4). \n \nDISCUSSION \nTo date, the effect of microbial ECP production on digested sludge has not been \nextensively investigated.  Alterations in the feed composition of anaerobically digested \nsludge had been shown to affect the level of ECP production and composition (Jia et al., \n1996) but this had not been related to the sludge dewaterability.  The limited results \navailable relating the ECP yield of digested sludge to the sludge dewaterability were \ninconclusive, with no significant relationship found for samples analysed from full-\nscale treatment works (Poxon and Darby, 1997; Houghton et al., 2000a) and a strong \npositive correlation from laboratory-scale results (Houghton et al., 2000b). Substituting \na proportion of the digester feed primary sludge for glucose solution or propionic acid \nencouraged the activity of different microbial populations, acidogenic and \nacetogenic\/methanogenic bacteria respectively, in the digesting sludge, allowing the \nimpact on ECP production and dewaterability to be assessed under controlled \nconditions. \nIncreasing the feed sludge carbohydrate content with glucose, gave a large increase in \nthe ECP yield from the digested sludge, (Table 4) as observed previously from full-\nscale (Poxon and Darby, 1997) and laboratory-scale (Jia et al., 1996) samples.  The \nprovision of glucose, an easily assimilated substrate that is readily available to bacteria \n 12\nin the initial stages of digestion, has stimulated ECP production in contrast to primary \nsludge and primary sludge with propionic acid feed types, indicating that acidogenic \nbacteria are responsible for the excess ECP production. \nJia et al., (1996) found that the protein and carbohydrate content of the extracted ECP \nfrom digested glucose was higher (approximately 200 % and 2000 % respectively) than \nthat from digested propionate.  This was not observed in this study, where the extracted \nECP mean protein content was approximately 21 % higher and the mean carbohydrate \ncontent was slightly lower than that for ECP extracted from the primary with propionic \nacid digested sludge.  This could be due to a number of reasons.  Jia et al. (1996) used a \nnutrient and trace metal solution with the glucose and propionate substrates rather than   \nprimary sludge.  Degradation of primary sludge results in the presence of numerous \ncompounds, some of which may interfere with determination of protein (Davis, 1988). \nPrimary sludge also contains ECP that may have been degraded differently by each \ndominant microbial population when glucose or propionic acid were added to the feed, \nwith differing fractions of the undigested ECP remaining in the digested sludge.  The \nECP extraction methods used were different in each case and this can affect the \ncomposition of the extracted ECP.  Jia et al. carried out the experiment using 100 ml \naliquots of digesting sludge rather than 5 l fermentation vessels, and the HRT of each \nexperiment were different. \nAnaerobic digestion resulted in an increase in the protein content and a slight decrease \nin the carbohydrate content of the extracted ECP, irrespective of the feed type (Table 4), \nindicating that during digestion carbohydrate is preferentially degraded compared to \nprotein.   \nThe sludge filtrability was strongly affected by the level of ECP present in the sludge \n(Tables 3 and 4, Figure 3).  Digested primary sludge and primary sludge with propionic \n 13\nacid had similar CST results, 6.9-8.5 s, and extractable ECP yields, 14.1-19.2 mg g-1 SS.  \nAdding glucose to the primary sludge increased the digested sludge ECP yield to > 24 \nmg g-1 SS and doubled the CST to 14.0-16.3 s.  The CST is also affected by the particle \nsize distribution, with an increase in surface area increasing the frictional resistance to \nthe withdrawal of water (Lawler et al., 1986).  The digested primary sludge with \nglucose had fewer fine particles (Table 5) and hence a lower surface area than the other \ndigested feed types.  This indicated that it was likely that the extra ECP present in the \ndigested primary sludge with glucose that was making it harder to remove water from \nthe sludge (Wu et al., 1982), rather than the increased frictional resistance of the \nparticles (Lawler et al., 1986).  The gravity drainage test also indicated that the presence \nof extra ECP in the digested sludge made the sludge harder to drain (Figure 4) but the \nresult was not significant at the P = 0.05 level. \nThe effect of the different feed types on the particle size of the digested sludge clearly \nshowed the different level of activity of the separate microbial groups.  Digested \nprimary sludge with glucose had an increased particle size at the low end (D(v,01) and \nD(v,0.5)) of the distribution.  This correlated with increased levels of ECP, which was \nlikely to result in flocculation of the smallest particles present (Wingender et al., 1999).  \nIn contrast, the mean D(v,0.9) was nearly half that of the digested primary sludge and \nprimary sludge with propionic acid.  The first stage in anaerobic digestion is hydrolysis, \nusing hydrolytic enzymes to break down the large particles of organic matter into \ncompounds that can then be assimilated by the bacteria and degraded further (Gujer and \nZehnder, 1983).  The availability of an easily assimilated substrate, glucose, has \nincreased this initial stage of digestion, reducing the largest particles present in the \nsludge in comparison to the other treatments. \n 14\nPrevious work has indicated that the particle size distribution of digested sludge has the \ngreatest impact on the sludge dewaterability (Karr and Keinath, 1978; Lawler et al., \n1986).  This may be true when similar levels of ECP are present in the sludge, but the \nresults presented here indicate that when the ECP content of a sludge is increased to a \nhigh concentration, it appears to have a direct impact on the sludge dewaterability that \nis not related to the size distribution of the particles. \n \nCONCLUS1ONS \nThe use of a high carbohydrate feed had a significant impact on the ECP content and \ndewaterability of digested sludge: the extractable ECP yield doubled; the measured CST \ndoubled; the mean gravity drainage time increased; the particle size distribution altered \nwith fewer fine particles and a reduction in the largest particle size. \nSubstitution of part of the primary sludge feed with propionic acid had no impact on the \ndigested sludge ECP content and dewaterability compared to the control digesters fed \n100 % primary sludge. \nThe relationship between the extracted ECP yield and sludge filtrability was significant \nat the P = 0.01 level.  For the sludge produced, a calculated ECP yield of 17.2 mg g-1 SS \nappeared to be necessary for optimum sludge dewaterability. \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nJIH is supported by a UK Engineering and Physical Sciences research Council (EPSRC) \nGrant GR\/L 87255 and supported by Anglian Water plc.
