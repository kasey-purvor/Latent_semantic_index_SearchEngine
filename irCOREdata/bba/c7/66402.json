In all cases we find perfect agreement\nwith the corresponding string amplitudes derived from the three-string vertex.\n1 Introduction\nThe pp-wave\/SYM correspondence in its original form [1] emphasises a duality relation\nbetween the masses of string states and the anomalous dimensions [2] of the BMN oper-\nators in the dual gauge theory. This correspondence was further discussed and extended\nin [3, 4], where it was expressed in the form [4]\n1\n\u00b5\nHstring = \u2206\u2212 J . (1.1)\nHere Hstring is the full string field theory Hamiltonian, \u00b5 is the scale parameter of the pp-\nwave background, and \u2206\u2212 J is the gauge theory dilatation operator (which in the radial\nquantisation formalism plays the ro\u02c6le of the Hamiltonian HSYM) minus the R-charge. The\nrelation (1.1) is expected to be exact and hold in the double scaling limit N \u223c J2 \u2192 \u221e\nto all orders in the two free parameters of the theory, g2 and \u03bb\n\u2032\n\u03bb\u2032 =\ng2YMN\nJ2\n=\n1\n(\u00b5p+\u03b1\u2032)2\n, (1.2)\ng2 =\nJ2\nN\n= 4pi gst (\u00b5p\n+\u03b1\u2032)2 . (1.3)\nOn the gauge theory side, \u03bb\u2032 is the effective coupling constant of the BMN sector, and g2\nis the effective genus counting parameter of Feynman diagrams [1, 5, 6]. The right hand\nsides of (1.2), (1.3) express \u03bb\u2032 and g2 in terms of the pp-wave string theory parameters\nto the effect that 1\/\u03bb\u2032 \u221d \u00b5 measures the deviation from the flat background and g2 is\nproportional to the string coupling gst in IIB.\nSince the two Hamiltonians, Hstring and \u2206, act on the states of two different theories,\nthe duality relation (1.1) requires an isomorphism between the Hilbert spaces of the light-\ncone gauge pp-wave string field theory and of the BMN sector of the N = 4 gauge theory.\nMore specifically, we need to establish a one-to-one correspondence between the bases of\ntwo theories, {|s\u03b1\u3009string} and {|s\u03b1\u3009SYM},\n|s\u03b1\u3009string \u2194 |s\u03b1\u3009SYM , (1.4)\nwhich preserves the scalar product,\nstring\u3008s\u03b1|s\u03b2\u3009string = SYM\u3008s\u03b1|s\u03b2\u3009SYM . (1.5)\nThen the correspondence (1.1) holds at the matrix elements level,\nstring\u3008s\u03b1|\u00b5\u22121Hstring|s\u03b2\u3009string = SYM\u3008s\u03b1|\u2206\u2212 J |s\u03b2\u3009SYM . (1.6)\nThe string field theory Hilbert space is equipped with a natural basis of multi-string\nstates,\n{|s\u03b1\u3009string} = |stringa\u3009 , |stringb\u3009 \u2297 |stringc\u3009 , |stringd\u3009 \u2297 |stringe\u3009 \u2297 |stringf\u3009 , . . . (1.7)\n1\nwhich diagonalises the free string Hamiltonian and is automatically orthonormal. Here\na, b, . . . are the labels of single-string states. This basis does not diagonalise the full string\nHamiltonian, Hstring, since free string states in (1.7) can interact (split and join). The\nsplitting and joining of a single string state is described by the three-string interaction,\nand the corresponding matrix element on the left hand side of (1.6) is\n\u3008stringa|H intstring|stringb\u3009 \u2297 |stringc\u3009 \u2261 \u3008stringa|\u3008stringb|\u3008stringc|H3\u3009 . (1.8)\nHere the |H3\u3009 is the three-string interaction vertex in the light-cone string field theory\nin the pp-wave background. The expression for this vertex was originally obtained by\nSpradlin and Volovich [7,8] and further studied and clarified by Pankiewicz and Stefanski\nin [9, 10] and in other papers including [11, 12]. Its expression is recalled in Appendix\nA.1 However, there is a puzzle related to the three-string amplitudes (1.8) built on the\nSpradlin-Volovich vertex which we would like to clarify in this paper, among other things.\nThe presence of a non-trivial R\u2013R field in the pp-wave background breaks the light-cone\nLorentz symmetry SO(8) down to SO(4) \u00d7 SO(4) \u00d7 Z2. The two SO(4)\u2019s rotate the\nfirst and the last four directions among themselves, while the Z2 symmetry swaps these\ntwo groups of four directions. Apparently, the Z2 part of the bosonic symmetry of the\npp-wave background is not respected by the Spradlin-Volovich three-string interactions\n[13, 14, 8, 11, 15]: there is a relative minus sign in the string amplitude involving states\nwith two oscillators along the first SO(4) compared to that with two oscillators along the\nsecond SO(4). An unbroken Z2-invariance would not allow this to happen. We will argue\nnow that this minus sign implies a spontaneous breaking of the Z2 symmetry of the string\nfield theory in the pp-wave background.\nThe ket-vertex |H3\u3009 (A.5), (A.6) of [7, 8] is built on the string state |0\u3009 which is the\nground state of the theory in flat background, but not in the pp-wave background. At the\nsame time, the external string bra-states in (1.8) are built on the true pp-wave ground\nstate |v\u3009. It was explained in [11] that these two states, |0\u3009 and |v\u3009, have an opposite\nZ2 parity, i.e. cannot be both invariant under Z2. Hence, it follows immediately [8, 11]\nthat the amplitude (1.8) is not invariant under the action of Z2, but changes sign. In the\nrecent paper [12], the result of [7, 8], which utilised the vacuum |0\u3009, was compared with\nan alternative formalism of constructing |H3\u3009 starting directly from the true ground-state\n|v\u3009. The two formalisms were found to be identical. Following [12, 7, 8] we choose the\nZ2-parity prescription\nZ2 : |0\u3009 \u2192 |0\u3009 , Z2 : |v\u3009 \u2192 \u2212|v\u3009 . (1.9)\nThis means that the vertex |H3\u3009 built on |0\u3009 is invariant under Z2, but the pp-wave string\nground-state \u3008v| and, hence, the external states \u3008stringa|\u3008stringb|\u3008stringc| in (1.8), acquire\na minus sign. This implies a spontaneous breaking of the Z2 symmetry of the string field\ntheory in the pp-wave background, which is the physical reason for the minus sign of the\nmatrix element discussed above.\n1For notational simplicity and in order to distinguish this vertex from other proposals, we will some-\ntimes refer to the vertex of [7, 8, 9, 10] simply as the Spradlin-Volovich vertex.\n2\nOne of the objectives of this paper is to verify with an independent gauge theory\ncalculation this important minus sign (and hence the spontaneous breaking of Z2), as well\nas the related fact that the three-string amplitude (1.8) vanishes for string states with one\ndirection along the first, and one one direction along the second SO(4), i.e. one vector\nand one scalar impurity in the gauge theory language.\nAs already mentioned, and following [4,16,17], in order to compare (1.8) with matrix\nelements of the dilatation operator in gauge theory via (1.6), it is important to identify\na basis in gauge theory which is isomorphic to the natural string basis (1.7). We discuss\nthis issue in section 2. States in the isomorphic to string basis, {|s\u03b1\u3009SYM}, are obtained\nfrom linear combinations of the original multi-trace BMN [1] operators O\u03b1(x),\n|s\u03b1\u3009SYM = U\u03b1\u03b2 O\u03b2(x = 0)|0\u3009 , (1.10)\nwhere U\u03b1\u03b2 is an x-independent matrix. This matrix was determined in [4,17] by requiring\nthat (1.6) holds, i.e. that the known three-string interaction vertex of the pp-wave light-\ncone string field theory [7, 8] is reproduced from gauge theory matrix elements of the\ndilatation operator involving BMN states (operators) with two scalar impurities.\nIn this paper we will take U\u03b1\u03b2 determined in [17], and use it to construct the gauge\ntheory basis (1.10) for an arbitrary number of scalar impurities. With this in hand\nwe can compute generic gauge theory matrix elements on the right hand side of (1.6).\nThe contributions on the left hand side of (1.6) are then computed using (1.8). We\nwill verify (1.6) and hence the Spradlin-Volovich expression for |H3\u3009 for generic bosonic\nimpurities. First successful steps in this direction have been already taken in [17, 18] at\nthe level of arbitrary number of identical scalar impurities.2 However, the inclusion of\nvector impurities is essential in order to address in the gauge theory the two important\nproperties of the three-string interaction discussed earlier:\n(1) the vanishing of the three-string amplitude for string states with one vector and one\nscalar impurity; and\n(2) the relative minus sign in the string amplitude involving states with two vector\nimpurities compared to that with two scalar impurities.\nIn section 3 we will verify (1) and (2) working at the two-impurity level, and will con-\nsider all representations of BMN operators with two vector or scalar impurities, i.e. sym-\nmetric traceless, antisymmetric and singlet. By considering BMN operators with vector,\nscalar and mixed (scalar+vector) impurities we explore and verify the correspondence\n(1.6) for string states in all the directions of the two SO(4) groups.\nIn section 5, we will calculate the gauge theory matrix elements of \u2206 \u2212 J for states\nwith an arbitrary number of scalar impurities. Next we compute the corresponding three-\nstring amplitudes derived from the three-string vertex and compare them to the field\ntheory result, finding perfect agreement.\n2For further tests of the correspondence in the open-closed string sector, see [19].\n3\nFinally, section 4 and section 6 are dedicated to computations of three-point correlators\nof BMN operators. These results are used earlier in section 3 and 5 for the calculation\nof matrix elements. More specifically, in section 4 we compute the coefficient of the\nconformal three-point function of BMN operators with mixed (one scalar and one vector)\nimpurities. In section 6 we generalise this analysis to the case of BMN operators with an\narbitrary number of scalar impurities.\n2 The dilatation operator in SYM and the natural\nstring basis\nAs mentioned earlier, the BMN basis in SYM which is isomorphic to the natural string\nbasis in dual string field theory, is a certain linear combination (1.10) of the original BMN\noperators O\u03b1(x) proposed in [1]. The states in the natural string basis are not identically\nequal to the original BMN operators since the former are automatically orthonormal,\nwhile the latter are not, and their overlaps depend on the string coupling g2. In other\nwords, the matrix U in (1.10) is not simply the identity matrix.\nApart from the original BMN basis, there is another distinguished basis of the confor-\nmal primary BMN operators O\u2206\u03b1(x) which are the eigenstates of the dilatation operator\n\u2206 in gauge theory. This \u2206-BMN basis is again a linear combination of the states from the\noriginal BMN basis O\u03b1(x) with a different x-independent matrix U . For BMN operators\nwith scalar impurities, this basis was constructed in [20] and extended to include vector\nand mixed impurities in [21]. The \u2206-BMN basis is particularly convenient since the two-\nand three-point correlation functions of \u2206-BMN operators can be written in the simple\ncanonical form with a universal x-dependence, guaranteed by conformal invariance of the\ntheory. For conformal primary operators with scalar impurities these canonical correlators\nare particularly simple and are given by\n\u3008O\u2020\u2206\u03b1(x)O\u2206\u03b2(0)\u3009 =\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2\n(x2)\u2206\u03b1\n, (2.1)\n\u3008O\u22061(x1)O\u22062(x2)O\u2020\u22063(x3)\u3009 =\nC123\n(x212)\n\u22061+\u22062\u2212\u22063\n2 (x213)\n\u22061+\u22063\u2212\u22062\n2 (x223)\n\u22062+\u22063\u2212\u22061\n2\n. (2.2)\nCanonical expression for the correlators involving conformal primary operators with vector\nimpurities appear to be much less illuminating and harder to interpret, however it was\nnoted in [21] that this difficulty is avoided and the correlators for all types of impurities\ncan be expressed in the same form, similar to (2.1) and (2.2), if on the left hand sides\nof (2.1) and (2.2) we use a different notion of conjugation O\u00af instead of O\u2020 [21]. This\ndifferent notion of operator conjugation is defined as hermitian conjugation followed by\nan inversion of the operator argument x\u2032\u00b5 = x\u00b5\/x\n2. Under inversion a scalar operator\n4\nO\u2206(x) of conformal dimension \u2206 transforms as\nO\u2020\u2206(x)\u2192 O\u2020\n\u2032\n\u2206(x\n\u2032) = x2\u2206O\u2020\u2206(x) , x\u00b5 \u2192 x\u2032\u00b5 =\nx\u00b5\nx2\n, (2.3)\nwhile a vector or tensor operator (i.e. operator with vector impurities) contains a factor\nJ\u00b5\u03bd(x) = \u03b4\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 2x\u00b5x\u03bd\/x2 on the right hand side for each vector index of the operator.\nJ\u00b5\u03bd(x) is the usual inversion tensor, in terms of which the Jacobian of the inversion is\nexpressed \u2202x\u2032\u00b5\/\u2202x\u03bd = J\u00b5\u03bd(x)\/x\n2. This prescription is essential in order to make vector\n\u2206-BMN operators orthonormalisable, see section 2 of [21] for more details.\nWith this prescription, the two-point function (2.1) for vector and for scalar \u2206-BMN\noperators takes the same simple form:\n\u3008O\u00af\u2206\u03b1(x)O\u2206\u03b2(0)\u3009 = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 , (2.4)\nwhich does not depend on x and hence has the meaning of overlap of the corresponding\nstates in the gauge theory Hilbert space.\nNote, however, that these \u2206-BMN states are the eigenstates of \u2206, i.e. the eigenstates\nof the full interacting string Hamiltonian, so they cannot be identically equal to the\nstates from the natural string basis. The relation between the two bases is again a linear\ncombination\n|s\u03b1\u3009SYM = U\u03b1\u03b2 O\u2206\u03b2(x = 0)|0\u3009 , (2.5)\nwith another constant matrix U\u03b1\u03b2 . In general, for any basis of operators O\u02dc\u03b1 such that\nO\u02dc\u03b1 = U\u03b1\u03b2 O\u2206\u03b2 , (2.6)\nthe overlap is given by\n\u3008 \u00af\u02dcO\u03b1(x)O\u02dc\u03b2(0)\u3009 = U\u03b2\u03b3U \u2020\u03b3\u03b1 \u2261 S\u03b2\u03b1. (2.7)\nThe operators O\u02dc\u03b1 do not anymore have definite scaling dimensions \u2206, but since they are\nexpressed as a linear superposition of conformal primary operators which do, there is no\nproblem in performing the inversion required to define \u00af\u02dcO\u03b1(x), and the right hand side of\n(2.7) follows.\nNow we describe a practical way of how to calculate simultaneously the overlaps and\nthe matrix elements of the anomalous dimension operator \u03b4 = \u2206 \u2212 \u2206cl, where \u2206cl is\nthe engineering dimension. Let us define the barred-operator \u00af\u02dcO(x) as the Hermitian\nconjugation of O\u02dc(x) followed by an inversion of the resulting operator, defined as if it was\nfree, i.e. instead of the factor x2\u2206 in (2.3) we put x2\u2206cl , such that,\nO\u00af\u2206(x) \u2261 x2\u2206cl J \u00b7 O\u2020\u2206(x) , (2.8)\n5\nwhere J\u00b5\u03bd(x) is the usual inversion tensor for each vector index (each vector impurity) of\nthe operator. Then the two-point function takes the form:\n\u3008 \u00af\u02dcO\u03b1(x)O\u02dc\u03b2(0)\u3009 = U\u03b2\u03b3 e\u03b4\u03b3 log x\u22122 U \u2020\u03b3\u03b1 = S\u03b2\u03b1 + T\u03b2\u03b1 log x\u22122 +O ((log x\u22122)2) . (2.9)\nHere we have expanded the full result in powers of log x\u22122. The overlap of the two states\nis defined as the zeroth-order term in the expansion, S\u03b2\u03b1 = U\u03b2\u03b3U\n\u2020\n\u03b3\u03b1, and the matrix of\nanomalous dimensions in this basis is the first order term,\nT\u03b2\u03b1 = U\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\u03b3U\n\u2020\n\u03b3\u03b1 . (2.10)\nWe note that (2.9), and hence the definitions of the overlap and the anomalous dimension\nmatrix, are valid to all orders in the gauge coupling, and so can be in principle computed\nto all orders in \u03bb\u2032 and g2 for any basis O\u02dc\u03b1.\nBy initially relating this basis to the \u2206-BMN basis we avoided all the problems of\nremoving the \u2018non-universal\u2019 x-dependence on the right hand side of the correlator. Now\nwe can forget about the \u2206-BMN basis and follow the simple prescription discussed above:\nfor an arbitrary basis, the overlap matrix S\u03b2\u03b1 and the anomalous dimensions matrix T\u03b2\u03b1\nare the zeroth and the first term in the expansion of (2.9) in powers of log x\u22122.\nWe now consider the original BMN basis, for which we have\n\u3008O\u00af\u03b1(x)O\u03b2\u3009 = S\u03b2\u03b1 + T\u03b2\u03b1 log x\u22122 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (2.11)\nand relate this basis to the isomorphic to string basis via (1.10),\nOstring\u03b2 = U\u03b2\u03b3O\u03b3 , O\u00afstring\u03b1 = O\u00af\u03b4U \u2020\u03b4\u03b1 . (2.12)\nIn the isomorphic to string basis (which is automatically orthonormal, as explained earlier)\nwe get\nSstring = 1l = USU \u2020 , T string = UTU \u2020 . (2.13)\nWe note that S is a Hermitian, positive matrix (it is a matrix of norms), therefore the\nmatrix S\u22121\/2 is well-defined.3 S is then diagonalised by the matrix U := S\u22121\/2 \u00b7 V , where\nV \u2020V = 1l:\nS \u2212\u2192 USU \u2020 = 1l , (2.14)\nT \u2212\u2192 UTU \u2020 = V \u2020(S\u2212 12TS\u2212 12 )V . (2.15)\nThe arbitrariness contained in V , which is still left at this stage was fixed in [4, 17] by\nrequiring that (1.6) holds and that the known three-string interaction vertex of the pp-\nwave light-cone string field theory [7,8] is reproduced from gauge theory matrix elements\ninvolving BMN states (operators) with two scalar impurities. This condition implies\nV = 1l. Hence, the matrix of anomalous dimensions in the string basis is given by\n\u0393 := T string = S\u2212\n1\n2 T S\u2212\n1\n2 . (2.16)\n3We would like to point our that this matrix S\u2212\n1\n2 appears also in [16] and [22].\n6\nIn the following sections we will show that, with the same choice of V = 1l, the matrix\nelements of \u0393 between BMN operators with\n\u2022 two vector impurities,\n\u2022 one vector and one scalar impurity and, finally,\n\u2022 an arbitrary number of scalar impurities,\nprecisely agree with the corresponding matrix elements of the interacting string Hamil-\ntonian. We will consider all representations of BMN operators with vector or scalar\nimpurities, i.e. symmetric traceless, antisymmetric and singlet. The inclusion of vector,\nmixed (scalar-vector) and scalar BMN operators allows us to study the correspondence\nfor string states in all of the pp-wave light-cone directions.\nOther studies of the dilatation operator in gauge theory and its interpretation in\nquantum mechanical models, which we do not pursue here, can be found in the recent\npapers [23, 24, 22, 25].\n3 Tests of the correspondence in the two-impurity\nsector: scalar, mixed, and vector states\nIn this and the following sections we will need the expressions for the single-trace original\nBMN operators:\nOJvac =\n1\u221a\nJNJ0\nTrZJ , (3.1)\nOJij,m = C\n(\nJ\u2211\nl=0\ne\n2piiml\nJ Tr\n(\n\u03c6iZ\nl\u03c6jZ\nJ\u2212l\n))\n, (3.2)\nOJ\u00b5\u03bd,m =\nC\n2\n(\nJ\u2211\nl=0\ne\n2piiml\nJ Tr\n[\n(D\u00b5Z)Z\nl(D\u03bdZ)Z\nJ\u2212l\n]\n+ Tr\n[\n(D\u00b5D\u03bdZ)Z\nJ+1\n])\n, (3.3)\nOJi\u00b5,m =\nC\u221a\n2\n(\nJ\u2211\nl=0\ne\n2piiml\nJ Tr\n[\n\u03c6iZ\nl(D\u00b5Z)Z\nJ\u2212l\n]\n+ Tr\n[\n(D\u00b5\u03c6i)Z\nJ+1\n])\n, (3.4)\nwhere i, j = 1, . . . , 4, \u00b5, \u03bd = 1, . . . , 4 label the scalar and the vector impurities. Note that\nin writing OJij,m and OJ\u00b5\u03bd,m we have taken i 6= j and \u00b5 6= \u03bd, where the above expressions\ntake the simple form (3.2) and (3.3). We also defined\nC := 1\u221a\nJNJ+20\n, N0 :=\ng2\n2\nN\n4pi2\n. (3.5)\nThe normalisation of the operators is such that their two-point functions take the canon-\nical form in the planar limit. We also note that expressions for OJ\u00b5\u03bd,n and OJi\u00b5,m contain\n7\nappropriate compensating terms [26,27]. These terms are required in order for the corre-\nsponding operator to be conformal primaries in the BMN limit.\nThe operators in (3.2)\u2013(3.4) are the original BMN operators. They are related to each\nother by supersymmetry transformations [27]. In order to test the correspondence, we\nneed to use a different basis of operators which is isomorphic to string states, as discussed\nearlier. Importantly, the isomorphic to string operators O\u02dcJi\u00b5,m, O\u02dcJ\u00b5\u03bd,m are related to the\nO\u02dcJij,m in exactly the same way as the original BMN operators are. This is because the\nmatrix U in (2.6) is a numerical matrix, i.e. it does not contain any fields and does\nnot transform under supersymmetry. Hence, U is the same for scalar, vector and mixed\nimpurity BMN operators.\nWe will also need the expressions for the double-trace operators\nT J,yij,m = : Oy\u00b7Jij,m : : O(1\u2212y)\u00b7Jvac : , (3.6)\nT J,y\u00b5\u03bd,m = : Oy\u00b7J\u00b5\u03bd,m : : O(1\u2212y)\u00b7Jvac : , (3.7)\nT J,yi\u00b5,m = : Oy\u00b7Ji\u00b5,m : : O(1\u2212y)\u00b7Jvac : , (3.8)\nwhere y \u2208 (0, 1).\nFrom the three-string vertex of [7,8] one extracts the following matrix elements of the\nstring Hamiltonian in the large-\u00b5 limit:\n1\n\u00b5\n\u3008OJij,m|Hstring|T J,yij,n\u3009 = \u2212Cnorm\n\u03bb\u2032\npi2y\nsin2(pimy) , (3.9)\n1\n\u00b5\n\u3008OJi\u00b5,m|Hstring|T J,yi\u00b5,n\u3009 = 0 , (3.10)\n1\n\u00b5\n\u3008OJ\u00b5\u03bd,m|Hstring|T J,y\u00b5\u03bd,n\u3009 = Cnorm\n\u03bb\u2032\npi2y\nsin2(pimy) , (3.11)\nfor \u00b5 6= \u03bd and i 6= j. The overall normalisation Cnorm is left undetermined in string field\ntheory. In order to get agreement with the field theory result we will set here4\nCnorm = \u2212g2\n2\n\u221a\ny(1\u2212 y)\u221a\nJ\n. (3.12)\nUsing this normalisation, (3.9) and (3.11) become\n1\n\u00b5\n\u3008OJij,m|Hstring|T J,yij,n\u3009 = \u2212\n1\n\u00b5\n\u3008OJ\u00b5\u03bd,m|Hstring|T J,y\u00b5\u03bd,n\u3009 = \u03bb\u2032\ng2\u221a\nJ\n\u221a\n(1\u2212 y)\/y sin2(pimy)\n2 pi2\n. (3.13)\n4Cnorm is further discussed in section 5.2, where we consider the case of arbitrary many impurities,\nsee (5.24).\n8\nAs mentioned earlier, the agreement of (3.9) with the corresponding gauge theory matrix\nelements was found in [17]. We will show that agreement with gauge theory holds also\nfor (3.10) and (3.11).\nWe now need the explicit form of the matrices S and T in the original BMN basis.\nBoth S and T have an expansion in powers of g2, but in our analysis we will need their\nexpressions only up to and including O(g2) terms. We will also work at one loop in the\nYang-Mills effective coupling \u03bb\u2032, where the matrix T is of O(\u03bb\u2032), whereas S is of O(1). In\nthis case, (2.9) is simply\n\u3008O\u03b1(0)O\u00af\u03b2(x)\u3009 = S\u03b1\u03b2 + T\u03b1\u03b2 log(x\u039b)\u22122 . (3.14)\nThe pleasant fact is that expressions for S and T are closely related and can be obtained\nfrom the coefficients of the three-point functions, which were derived in [20,21] for BMN\noperators with two scalar and two vector impurities, respectively. We also need to know\nS and T in the case of mixed (i.e. one scalar and one vector) impurities. The three-\npoint functions of such BMN operators were not considered previously, and they will be\ncalculated in section 4.\nThe diagonal elements of S and T can be immediately obtained from\n\u3008OJAB,m(0) O\u00afJAB,n(x)\u3009 = \u03b4mn\n(\n1 + \u03bb\u2032m2 log(\u039bx)\u22122\n)\n, (3.15)\n\u3008T J,yAB,m(0) T\u00af J,zAB,n(x)\u3009 = \u03b4mn\u03b4yz\n(\n1 + \u03bb\u2032(m2\/y2) log(\u039bx)\u22122\n)\n. (3.16)\nThe previous expressions are valid up to O(\u03bb\u2032) and O(g2), and were derived originally\nin [6, 20] for the scalar case, and in [26, 29, 30] for the mixed and vector case.\nTo determine the off-diagonal elements, we need to compute the two-point correlators\n\u3008T J,yAB,n(0) O\u00afJAB,n(x)\u3009. To this end, let us momentarily focus on the following class of three-\npoint correlators,\nG(x1, x2, x3) = \u3008Oy\u00b7JAB,n(x1)O(1\u2212y)\u00b7Jvac (x2)O\u00afJAB,m(x3)\u3009 , (3.17)\nwhere A = (i, \u00b5) and A 6= B. On general grounds, these three-point function have the\nform [6, 31, 20, 32]\nG(x1, x2, x3) = g2Cm,ny\n[\n1\u2212 \u03bb\u2032 (am,ny log(x31\u039b)2 + bm,ny log(x32x31\u039b\/x12))] , (3.18)\nwhere g2Cm,ny is the tree-level contribution, with\nCm,ny :=\n\u221a\n(1\u2212 y)\/y sin2(pimy)\u221a\nJ pi2(m\u2212 n\/y)2 , (3.19)\nand the coefficients am,ny and bm,ny must be calculated in perturbation theory at O(\u03bb\u2032).\nThe two-point function \u3008T J,yAB,n(0) O\u00afJAB,m(x)\u3009 can easily be deduced from (3.17) by setting\nx13 = x23 = x and x12 = \u039b\n\u22121 [32],\n\u3008T J,yAB,n(0) O\u00afJAB,m(x)\u3009 = g2Cm,ny\n[\n1 + \u03bb\u2032 (am,ny + bm,ny) log(x\u039b)\n\u22122\n]\n. (3.20)\n9\nThe matrices S and T are then given, up to O(g2), by\nS =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed \u03b4mn g2Cm,qz\ng2Cpy,n \u03b4pq\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 + O(g22) = 1l + g2s+O(g22) , (3.21)\n(3.22)\nT = \u03bb\u2032\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed m2 \u03b4mn g2Cm,ny (a+ b)m,qz\ng2Cpy,n (a + b)py,n (p\n2\/y2) \u03b4pq\u03b4yz\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 + O(g22) (3.23)\n\u2261 d + g2t + O(g22) ,\nwith\nd = \u03bb\u2032\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed m2 \u03b4mn 0\n0 (p2\/y2) \u03b4pq\u03b4yz\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 , (3.24)\nt = \u03bb\u2032\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed 0 Cm,ny (a + b)m,qz\nCpy,n (a+ b)py,n 0\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 . (3.25)\nIt then follows that\nS\u22121\/2 = 1l\u2212 g2(s\/2) +O(g22) (3.26)\ndiagonalises S at O(g2).\nWe now need to compute the explicit expressions for aymn and b\ny\nmn, in the scalar case,\nmixed (scalar-vector) case, and finally in the vector case.\nIt is easy to compute at O(\u03bb\u2032) the coefficient aymn in planar perturbation theory, which\nturns out to be\nam,ny =\nn2\ny2\n, (3.27)\nindependently of the type of impurity considered. Notice that this is exactly the O(\u03bb\u2032)\nanomalous dimension5 of the \u201csmall\u201d BMN operator at x1.\nWe will now explain how bm,ny is determined from the coefficients of the conformal\nthree-point function. First we note that the correlator (3.17) does not take the conformal\nform (2.2) since the original BMN operators in (3.18) are not conformal primaries for\ng2 6= 0 due to operator mixing [33, 20]. However, at leading order in g2, the only mixing\neffect which contributes to (2.2) is the presence of the double-trace corrections in the\n5It is immediate to convince oneself that the Feynman diagrams contributing to the log x231 part of\n\u3008Oy\u00b7JAB,n(x1)O(1\u2212y)\u00b7Jvac (x2)O\u00afJAB,m(x3)\u3009 are those where the operator O(1\u2212y)\u00b7Jvac (x2) does not participate in\nthe interaction, i.e. they are precisely the Feynman diagrams contributing to the anomalous dimension\nof Oy\u00b7JAB,n(x1) - embedded in a three-point function.\n10\nexpression for the conjugate \u2206-BMN operator.6 Importantly, [28,21], these mixing effects\ncannot affect the remaining logarithm, \u03bb\u2032 log x212, which can then be computed without\ntaking into account mixing altogether. Hence, we can use the right hand side of the\nconformal expression (2.2) in order to compute the coefficient bm,ny in (3.18). Expanding\nthe right-hand side of (2.2) to O(\u03bb\u2032), and equating the coefficient of the log x212 to the\ncorresponding term in (3.17), we obtain\ng2Cm,ny bm,ny = (m\n2 \u2212 n2\/y2) C(AnB\u2212n, vac| AmB\u2212m) , (3.28)\nwhere C(CnD\u2212n, vac| AmB\u2212m) is the coefficient C123 of the conformal three-point function\n\u3008OJ1CD,n(x1)OJ2vac(x2)O\u00afJAB,m(x3)\u3009. We used \u22061 = J1 + 2 + \u03bb\u2032n2\/y2, \u22062 = J , and \u22063 =\nJ + 2 + \u03bb\u2032m2.\nEquation (3.28) determines bm,ny in terms of the coefficients C(CnD\u2212n, vac| AmB\u2212m) of\nthe three-point function. These coefficients for BMN operators with two scalar impurities,\none scalar and one vector impurity, and two vector impurities are given by:\nC(knl\u2212n, vac| imj\u2212m) = Cvac123\n2 sin2(pimy)\ny pi2(m2 \u2212 n2\ny2\n)2\n(\n\u03b4i(k\u03b4l)j m\n2 + \u03b4i[k\u03b4l]j\nmn\ny\n+ 1\n4\n\u03b4ij\u03b4kl\nn2\ny2\n)\n(3.29)\nC(jn\u03bd\u2212n, vac| im\u00b5\u2212m) = Cvac123\n2 sin2(pimy)\ny pi2(m2 \u2212 n2\ny2\n)2\n\u03b4ij\u03b4\u00b5\u03bd\n1\n4\n(\nm+\nn\ny\n)2\n, (3.30)\nC(\u03c1n\u03c3\u2212n, vac|\u00b5m\u03bd\u2212m) = Cvac123\n2 sin2(pimy)\ny pi2(m2 \u2212 n2\ny2\n)2\n(\n\u03b4\u00b5(\u03c1\u03b4\u03c3)\u03bd\nn2\ny2\n+ \u03b4\u00b5[\u03c1\u03b4\u03c3]\u03bd\nmn\ny\n+ 1\n4\n\u03b4\u00b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03c3m\n2\n)\n,\n(3.31)\nwhere Cvac123 =\n\u221a\nJJ1J2\/N = (g2\/\n\u221a\nJ)\n\u221a\ny(1\u2212 y), and the symmetric traceless and anti-\nsymmetric traceless combinations of two Kronecker deltas are defined as\n\u03b4i(k\u03b4l)j =\n1\n2\n(\u03b4ik\u03b4lj + \u03b4il\u03b4kj)\u2212 14\u03b4ij\u03b4kl , \u03b4i[k\u03b4l]j = 12(\u03b4ik\u03b4lj \u2212 \u03b4il\u03b4kj) . (3.32)\nThe three-point function coefficient for scalars (3.29) was derived in [20] (the simple\ncase n = 0 was first obtained in [31]), whereas that for the vectors, (3.31), was recently\nobtained in [21]. The three-point function coefficient (3.30) for the case of mixed scalar-\nvector impurities is a new result, and its derivation is presented in section 4 of this paper.\nFrom (3.29)\u2013(3.31) and (3.28), it is then immediate to derive the coefficients bm,ny\n6This is because the double-trace corrections to the single-trace expression for an original BMN op-\nerator is of O(g2), i.e. suppressed with 1\/N . This can be compensated by factorising the three-point\nfunction into a product of two two-point functions, which is possible only for the double-trace mixing in\nthe operator O\u00af.\n11\nwhich correspond to considering scalar, mixed, or vector BMN operators in (3.17):\n[bm,ny]scalar = m\n2 \u2212 mn\ny\n, (3.33)\n[bm,ny]scalar\u2212vector =\n1\n2\n(\nm2 \u2212 n\n2\ny2\n)\n, (3.34)\n[bm,ny]vector = \u2212\nn2\ny2\n+\nmn\ny\n. (3.35)\nIn conclusion, using (3.20) we get, up to O(g2),\n\u3008T J,yij,n(0) O\u00afJij,m(x)\u3009 = g2Cm,ny\n[\n1 + \u03bb\u2032\n(\nm2 \u2212 mn\ny\n+\nn2\ny2\n)\nlog(x\u039b)\u22122\n]\n, (3.36)\n\u3008T J,yj\u03bd,n(0) O\u00afJi\u00b5,m(x)\u3009 = g2Cm,ny\n[\n1 +\n\u03bb\u2032\n2\n(\nm2 +\nn2\ny2\n)\nlog(x\u039b)\u22122\n]\n\u03b4ij\u03b4\u00b5\u03bd , (3.37)\n\u3008T J,y\u00b5\u03bd,n(0) O\u00afJ\u00b5\u03bd,m(x)\u3009 = g2Cm,ny\n[\n1 + \u03bb\u2032\n(\nmn\ny\n)\nlog(x\u039b)\u22122\n]\n. (3.38)\nWe will now make use of the expressions for these three correlators to construct the matrix\nT , and therefore the matrix \u0393 dual to H intstring, in the three cases of BMN states with (i)\ntwo scalar, (ii) one scalar and one vector, and finally (iii) two vector impurities. These\nthree cases are addressed separately below.\n3.1 Matrix elements with scalar BMN states\nThis case was first analysed in [17], and we review it here for completeness.\nSubstituting (3.27) and (3.33) in (3.23), we find that the matrix Tscalar is given, at\nO(g2), by7\nTscalar = \u03bb\n\u2032\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed m2 g2Cm,ny (m2 \u2212mn\/y + n2\/y2)\ng2Cny,m (m\n2 \u2212mn\/y + n2\/y2) n2\/y2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\u2261 d + g2 tscalar . (3.39)\nMultiplying it on the left and on the right by S\u22121\/2 = 1l \u2212 g2(s\/2) + O(g22) we get the\nexpression for the matrix \u0393 introduced in (2.16) at O(g2):\n\u0393scalar = d+ g2 [tscalar \u2212 (1\/2){s , d}] (3.40)\n7We use a somewhat simplified, but correct, notation for the indices of the matrices S and T .\n12\n= \u03bb\u2032\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed m2 (g2Cm,ny\/2) (m\u2212 n\/y)2\n(g2Cny,m\/2) (m\u2212 n\/y)2 n2\/y2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 ,\nfrom which it follows, using the definition (3.19) of Cm,ny,\n\u3008OJij,m |\u0393scalar| T J,yij,n\u3009 = \u03bb\u2032\ng2\u221a\nJ\n\u221a\n(1\u2212 y)\/y sin2(pimy)\n2 pi2\n. (3.41)\nThis result was first found in [17]. (3.41) agrees with (3.9) after choosing the normalisation\n(3.12) for the string result.\n3.2 Matrix elements with mixed BMN states\nIn this case, using (3.27) and (3.34) we can determine the matrix Tmixed in (3.23) for the\ncase of mixed impurities. It is given, at O(g2), by the following expression:\nTmixed = \u03bb\n\u2032\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed m2 g2Cm,ny (m2 + n2\/y2)\/2\ng2Cny,m (m\n2 + n2\/y2)\/2 n2\/y2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 (3.42)\n\u2261 d + g2 tmixed ,\nwhere we used am,ny + b\nmixed\nm,ny = (m\n2 + n2\/y2)\/2. It then follows that\n\u0393mixed = d+ g2 [tmixed \u2212 (1\/2){s , d}] = \u03bb\u2032\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed m2 0\n0 n2\/y2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 , (3.43)\nand hence\n\u3008OJi\u00b5,m |\u0393mixed| T J,yi\u00b5,n\u3009 = 0 . (3.44)\nThis verifies in gauge theory the vanishing of the three-string amplitude (3.10) between\nstates with one scalar and one vector impurity, which was predicted in [8].\n3.3 Matrix elements with vector BMN states\nFinally, we study the case of vector BMN impurities. Using (3.27) and (3.35) we obtain\nthe matrix Tvector in (3.23) for the case of vector impurities. At O(g2), it is given by:\nTvector = \u03bb\n\u2032\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed m2 g2Cm,ny (mn\/y)\ng2Cny,m (mn\/y) n\n2\/y2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 (3.45)\n13\n\u2261 d + g2 tvector ,\nwhere we used am,ny + b\nvector\nm,ny = mn\/y. It then follows that\n\u0393vector = d+ g2 [tvector \u2212 (1\/2){s , d}] (3.46)\n= \u03bb\u2032\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed m2 \u2212(g2Cm,ny\/2) (m\u2212 n\/y)2\n\u2212(g2Cm,ny\/2) (m\u2212 n\/y)2 n2\/y2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 ,\nfrom which we get\n\u3008OJ\u00b5\u03bd,m |\u0393vector| T J,y\u00b5\u03bd,n\u3009 = \u2212\u03bb\u2032\ng2\u221a\nJ\n\u221a\n(1\u2212 y)\/y sin2(pimy)\n2 pi2\n(3.47)\n= \u2212\u3008OJij,m |\u0393scalar| T J,yij,n\u3009 .\nAs advertised earlier, the off-diagonal elements \u3008OJ\u00b5\u03bd,m |\u0393vector| T J,y\u00b5\u03bd,n\u3009 of \u0393vector are precisely\nthe opposite of the corresponding elements \u3008OJij,m |\u0393scalar| T J,yij,n\u3009 of \u0393scalar. This again had\nbeen predicted in string field theory in [8]. As explained in the introduction, this signals\nthe spontaneous breaking of Z2 symmetry in pp-wave string theory.\n3.4 Generalisation to all representations for two-impurity BMN\nstates\nFinally, we extend our previous computations to include all representations of scalar and\nvector BMN operators with two impurities.\nWe recall here the results from the previous sections:\n\u3008OJij,m |\u0393scalar| T J,yij,n\u3009 = \u2212\u3008OJ\u00b5\u03bd,m |\u0393vector| T J,y\u00b5\u03bd,n\u3009 = \u03bb\u2032\ng2\u221a\nJ\n\u221a\n(1\u2212 y)\/y sin2(pimy)\n2 pi2\n,\n\u3008OJk\u00b5,m |\u0393mixed| T J,yl\u03bd,n\u3009 = 0 , (3.48)\n(i 6= j, \u00b5 6= \u03bd) which correspond to the string field theory amplitude (3.9), (3.10) and\n(3.11). From these results it is immediate to obtain\n\u3008OJ\u03bd\u00b5,m |\u0393vector | T J,y\u00b5\u03bd,n\u3009 = \u3008OJ\u00b5\u03bd,m |\u0393vector | T J,y\u00b5\u03bd,n\u3009 , (3.49)\nsince this amounts to complex conjugate the BMN phase factor contained in OJ\u00b5\u03bd,m, i.e. to\nexchange m\u2192 \u2212m (same considerations apply for the scalar amplitude). Equation (3.49)\nfollows since the first expression in (3.48) is even in m. Therefore we can at once obtain\nthe result for the symmetric-traceless and antisymmetric representations for vectors:\n\u3008OJ(\u00b5 \u03bd),m |\u0393vector | T J,y(\u03c1\u03c3),n\u3009 = \u2212\u03bb\u2032\ng2\u221a\nJ\n\u221a\n(1\u2212 y)\/y sin2(pimy)\npi2\n\u03b4\u00b5(\u03c1\u03b4\u03c3)\u03bd , (3.50)\n14\n\u3008OJ[\u00b5\u03bd],m |\u0393vector | T J,y[\u03c1\u03c3],n\u3009 = 0 , (3.51)\nwhereas for scalars,\n\u3008OJ(i j),m |\u0393scalar | T J,y(kl),n\u3009 = \u03bb\u2032\ng2\u221a\nJ\n\u221a\n(1\u2212 y)\/y sin2(pimy)\npi2\n\u03b4i(k\u03b4l)j , (3.52)\n\u3008OJ[ij],m |\u0393scalar | T J,y[kl],n\u3009 = 0 . (3.53)\nHere we have defined\nO(\u00b5\u03bd) = 1\n2\n(O\u00b5\u03bd +O\u03bd\u00b5)\u2212 \u03b4\u00b5\u03bd\n4\n\u2211\n\u03c1\nO\u03c1\u03c1 , O[\u00b5\u03bd] = 1\n2\n(O\u00b5\u03bd \u2212O\u03bd\u00b5) . (3.54)\nThe vector singlet case can be treated instantly by noticing that the three-point function\ncoefficient for vector singlets is actually the same as the three-point function coefficient\nfor the symmetric-traceless scalars, as it can be seen by comparing (3.29) to (3.31). This,\ntogether with (3.52), immediately implies that8\n\u3008OJvector 1,m |\u0393vector | T J,yvector 1,n\u3009 = \u03bb\u2032\ng2\u221a\nJ\n\u221a\n(1\u2212 y)\/y sin2(pimy)\npi2\n= \u2212\u3008OJscalar 1,m |\u0393scalar | T J,yscalar 1,n\u3009 , (3.55)\nwhere O1 = (1\/2)\n\u2211\n\u00b5O\u00b5\u00b5. We notice that the result for the scalar singlet amplitude\n\u3008OJscalar 1,m |\u0393scalar | T J,yscalar1,n\u3009 agrees with the result found in [18]. The opposite sign in\n(3.55) for the vector singlet compared to the scalar singlet case is again a manifestation\nof the (spontaneously broken) Z2 symmetry in pp-wave string theory.\n4 A technical aside: three-point function with mixed\nimpurities\nIn this section we derive the expression (3.30). The reader not interested in the actual\ncalculation can turn a few pages and proceed to the next section.\nHere we would like to compute the coefficient of the three-point function of one vacuum\noperator (3.1) and two conformal primary \u2206-BMN operators with one scalar and one\nvector impurity,\nO\u02dcJi\u00b5,m = OJi\u00b5,m + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (4.1)\n8The reader willing to derive explicitly the result (3.55) for vector singlets should be aware that, for\nsinglets, (3.20) should be modified to \u3008T J,y\n1,n (0) O\u00afJ1,m(x)\u3009 = g2Cm,ny\n[\n1 + \u03bb\u2032 (am,ny + bm,ny) log(x\u039b)\n\u22122\n]\n+\ng2C\u2212m,ny\n[\n1 + \u03bb\u2032 (a\u2212m,ny + b\u2212m,ny) log(x\u039b)\n\u22122\n]\n, and that, from the result (3.31) derived in [21], it follows\nthat [bm,ny]vector, 1 = m\n2 \u2212mn\/y.\n15\nwhere OJi\u00b5,m is defined in (3.4). The operator O\u02dcJi\u00b5,m has a definite scaling dimension,\n\u2206n = \u2206cl + \u03b4n, which implies that the single-trace expression OJi\u00b5,m on the right hand\nside of (4.1) must be accompanied by multi-trace corrections (and other mixing effects)\nat higher orders in g2 [33, 20]. The dots on the right hand side of (4.1) stand for these\ncorrections.\nNevertheless, our strategy is to study the three-point correlator of the original BMN\noperators OJi\u00b5,m,\n\u3008Oy\u00b7Jj\u03bd,n(x1)O(1\u2212y)\u00b7Jvac (x2)O\u00afJi\u00b5,m(x3)\u3009 = (4.2)\ng2Cm,ny\n[\n1\u2212 \u03bb\u2032\n(\nam,ny log(x31\u039b)\n2 + bmixedm,ny log\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223x32x31\u039bx12\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n)]\n\u03b4\u00b5\u03bd\u03b4ij ,\nand to focus on the computation of the coefficient bmixedm,ny of the log x12. This is because,\nfor reasons explained in the paragraph below (3.27), this coefficient can be computed\nwithout taking into account mixing altogether, and is directly related to the coefficient\nof the three-point function of conformal primary BMN operators with mixed impurities\nthrough (3.28). Therefore, from now on we will work with the original BMN operator\n(3.4).\nThe mixed BMN operator in (3.4) contains two terms: a \u201cpure\u201d BMN part and a\ncompensating term, first and second term on the right hand side of (3.4), respectively.\nThe Feynman diagrams contributing to the Green\u2019s function in (4.2) can be divided into\ntwo classes: those obtained by taking only the pure BMN part of Oy\u00b7Jj\u03bd,n(x1) and O\u00afJi\u00b5,m(x3)\nand those where the compensating part is taken (in one or both operators). As already\nexplained, we will focus only on diagrams which can produce a log x12 dependence, and\nboth classes of diagrams contribute to the coefficient bmixedm,ny in (4.2). For the sake of clarity,\nwe quote here the results from these two classes of diagrams:\n[\nbmixedm,ny\n]\nBMN\n= m\n(\nm\u2212 n\ny\n)\n, (4.3)\n[\nbmixedm,ny\n]\ncomp\n= \u22121\n2\n(\nm\u2212 n\ny\n)2\n. (4.4)\nThe total result\n[bm,ny]scalar\u2212vector =\n[\nbmixedm,ny\n]\nBMN\n+\n[\nbmixedm,ny\n]\ncomp\n=\n1\n2\n(\nm2 \u2212 n\n2\ny2\n)\n, (4.5)\nwas anticipated in (3.34). We now compute separately these two classes of diagrams. Our\nnotation and conventions are summarised in Appendix B.\n16\n4.1 Diagrams originating from the \u201cpure\u201d BMN parts\nWe consider first the diagrams where the scalar impurity interacts. These are represented\nin Figure 1. The result for these diagrams is:\n\u03c6i\u03c6i\u03c6i\n\u03c6i\u03c6i\u03c6i\nZ\u00afZ\u00afZ\u00af\nZ\u00afZ\u00afZ\u00af\n\u2202\u00b5Z\u2202\u00b5Z\u2202\u00b5Z\n\u2202\u00b5Z\u2202\u00b5Z \u2202\u00b5Z\nx1 x2\n1a 1b 1c\n1d 1e 1f\nFigure 1: Diagrams with scalar impurity interacting. Diagrams 1a and 1d have positive\nsigns, all the others have negative signs.\n(\n2\ng2\n)(\ng2\n2\n)4\n\u00b7 2(PI \u2212 PII + P\u00afI \u2212 P\u00afII) \u00b7 (2\u03b4\u00b5\u03bd)\u03b4ij \u00b7X . (4.6)\nThe first term on the right hand side of (4.6) comes from the diagram 1a (the coefficient\nof 2 is easily seen from \u2212VF in (B.4)), the second term is the sum of diagrams 1b and 1c.\nThe relative sign is also immediately seen from the commutators in \u2212VF . We have taken\ninto account the fact that diagrams 1b and 1c give the same contribution.9\n9This is a simple corollary of the cancellation of D-terms against gluon interactions and self-energies\nin three-point functions of BMN operators at O(\u03bb\u2032) (in the complex basis) [34, 6, 31, 20]. In our case,\nself-interactions diagrams do not participate since they cannot generate log x212 terms at order O(\u03bb\u2032).\n17\nThe third and fourth term in (4.6) come from the mirror diagrams 1d, 1e and 1f, where\nthe \u03c6 interaction is now at the bottom. The factor 2\u03b4\u00b5\u03bd comes from the free contraction\n10\nof the D\u00b5Z impurity with the D\u03bdZ impurity. The coefficients PI and PII come from\nsumming over the BMN phase factors, and their expressions are summarised in Appendix\nC. Mirror diagrams are associated with the complex conjugate coefficients P\u00afI and P\u00afII .\nFinally, the function X is defined in (D.2) of Appendix D.\nThere are additional diagrams, drawn in Figures 2 and 3, where the interaction involves\nnow the vector impurity.\n\u2202\u00b5Z\u2202\u00b5Z\u2202\u00b5Z\n\u03c6i\u03c6i\u03c6i\nZ\u00afZ\u00afZ\u00af\nx1 x2\n2a 2b 2c\nFigure 2: Diagrams with vector impurity interacting associated to PI .\nThese diagrams are identical to those in Figure 5 and 6 of [21], with the only modi-\nfication that the non-interacting impurity is now a scalar impurity (whereas in Figure 5\nand 6 of [21] it was a vector impurity). We will not compute again these diagrams, and\ninstead borrow the result from [21]. Their contribution turns out to be precisely the same\nof the contribution (4.6) from the diagrams where the scalar impurity interacts.\nThe final result for the pure BMN diagrams is therefore:(\n2\ng2\n)(\ng2\n2\n)4\n\u00b7 8(PI \u2212 PII + P\u00afI \u2212 P\u00afII) \u00b7 \u03b4\u00b5\u03bd\u03b4ij \u00b7X . (4.7)\nThis quantity has still to be multiplied by the normalisations of the operators, in which\nwe include an extra factor of J2 = (1\u2212 y) \u00b7 J coming from inequivalent Wick contractions\nof Ovac with the rest,\n1\u221a\nJ\n\u221a\n1\u2212 y\u221a\ny\n(\n1\u221a\n2\n)2\n. (4.8)\n10For an extensive discussion of the treatment of BMN operators with vector impurities, the reader is\nreferred to [21]. Free contractions of vector impurities are discussed in Eq. (34) of that paper, and the\nmain results can be summarised as \u3008D\u00b5Z D\u03bdZ\u3009free = 2 \u03b4\u00b5\u03bd , and \u3008Z D\u03bdZ\u3009free = 0.\n18\nZZ\nZ\u00af\nZ\u00af\n\u2202\u00b5Z\u2202\u00b5Z \u2202\u00b5Z\n\u2202\u00b5Z\u2202\u00b5Z \u2202\u00b5Z\n\u2202\u00b5Z\n\u2202\u03bdZ\u2202\u03bdZ\u2202\u03bdZ\n\u2202\u03bdZ\u2202\u03bdZ D\u03bdZ\n\u03c6i \u03c6i\n\u03c6i\n\u03c6i\n\u03c6i\u03c6i\n3a 3b 3c\n3d 3e 3f\nFigure 3: Diagrams with vector impurity interacting associated to PII .\n4.2 Diagrams from compensating terms\nThe compensating term is present in both operators at x3 and x1, therefore there are three\nsubclasses of diagrams: (i) diagrams with compensating term in the \u201cexternal\u201d operator\nat x3 and pure BMN part in the \u201cinternal\u201d (small) operator at x1; (ii) diagrams where\nthe compensating term of both operators at x1 and x3 is considered; and (iii) diagrams\nwhere the compensating term of the small operator at x1 and the pure BMN part of the\noperator at x3 are taken.\nEach diagram in class (i) vanishes separately, since the only way to contract the\nimpurity D\u03bdZ in Oy\u00b7Jj\u03bd,n(x1) is with a Z\u00af in O\u00afJi\u00b5,m(x3), and this contraction vanishes (see\nfootnote 10). Moreover , it is not difficult to see that the total contribution of the diagrams\nin class (ii) vanishes. Hence we are left with diagrams in class (iii), which we now discuss.\nWe start by considering diagrams without gluons. The first three diagram are repre-\nsented in Figure 4, and their contribution is(\n2\ng2\n)(\ng2\n2\n)4\n\u00b7 (2X \u2212X \u2212X \u00b7 q\u00afJ2) \u03b4\u00b5\u03bd\u03b4ij , (4.9)\n19\n\u03c6i\n\u03c6i\u03c6i \u2202\u00b5Z\u2202\u00b5Z\u2202\u00b5Z\n\u2202\u03bd\u03c6j \u2202\u03bd\u03c6j\u2202\u03bd\u03c6j Z\nZZ\n4a 4b 4c\nFigure 4: Diagrams originating from the compensating term in the \u2018internal\u2019 operator\n(at x1). In these diagrams no gluons are emitted or exchanged.\nwhere q = exp(2pim\/J) is the phase factor of the BMN operator at x3. The first term\nin the right hand side of (4.9) comes from the first diagram in Figure 4. This diagram\nis equal to the first diagram in Figure 5 of [21], from which we borrowed the result. The\nfactor of 2 is easily seen from the term Tr(2Z\u03c6iZ\u00af\u03c6i) in \u2212VF , see (B.4). The opposite\nsign of the second term in (4.9) is also seen from the term \u2212Tr(\u03c6i\u03c6iZZ\u00af) in \u2212VF . The\nthird term comes from the term \u2212Tr(\u03c6i\u03c6iZ\u00afZ) in \u2212VF , and carries a BMN phase factor\nq\u00afJ2. There are also mirror diagrams, where the interaction occurs at the bottom of the\ndiagram (similarly to the fourth, fifth and sixth diagram in Figure 1). As usual, their\neffect is to add the complex conjugate of the previous result, so that the final result for\ndiagrams without gluons is:(\n2\ng2\n)(\ng2\n2\n)4\n\u00b7 2X \u00b7 (1\u2212 cos (2pimy)) \u03b4\u00b5\u03bd\u03b4ij . (4.10)\nWe now consider diagrams where a gluon is emitted from the covariant derivative D\u03bd\u03c6j\nat x1. These gluon emission diagrams are represented in Figure 5. The total result for\nthem is: (\n2\ng2\n)(\ng2\n2\n)4\n\u00b7 (3X \u2212 3X \u00b7 q\u00afJ1) \u03b4\u00b5\u03bd\u03b4ij . (4.11)\nThe first term on the right hand side of (4.11) corresponds to the first diagram in Figure\n3. This diagram was computed in [21] (it is the third diagram in Figure 5), from which\nwe took the result. The only difference is that in the present case it is accompanied by\nphase factor equal to 1. The second term come from the second diagram in Figure 3, and\ncarries a BMN phase factor equal to q\u00afJ1. Again, there are also mirror diagrams, where\nthe interaction occurs at the bottom of the diagram. Their effect is to add the complex\nconjugate of the previous result, so that the final result for diagrams with gluon emission\nis: (\n2\ng2\n)(\ng2\n2\n)4\n\u00b7 6X \u00b7 (1\u2212 cos (2pimy)) \u03b4\u00b5\u03bd\u03b4ij .

These are depicted in Figure\n6 and, as before, there are also mirror diagrams, where the interaction occurs at the\nbottom of each diagram. However, each of the diagrams vanishes separately (this is to\n\u03c6i \u03c6i\u2202\u00b5Z\n\u2202\u00b5Z\n\u2202\u03bd\u03c6j\u2202\u03bd\u03c6j\nZZ\n6a 6b\nFigure 6: Gluon interaction diagrams, from the compensating term in the internal oper-\nator.\nbe contrasted with the case of scalar interactions, where gluon interactions double up the\nresult for the interaction from the scalar potential, as discussed in the previous subsection).\nThis was shown again in [21] (second diagram in Figure 5 of that paper).\nAdding (4.10) and (4.12) we get the total contribution of the compensating term\ndiagrams, (\n2\ng2\n)(\ng2\n2\n)4\n\u00b7 16X \u00b7 sin2 (pimy) \u03b4\u00b5\u03bd\u03b4ij .

Equation (4.15) is the principal result of this section.\nThe coefficient [bm,ny]scalar\u2212vector in (3.34) immediately follows by comparing (4.15) to\n(4.2). Finally, the three-point function coefficient (3.30) for mixed impurities is obtained\nfrom (3.34) and (3.28).\n5 The correspondence for an arbitrary number of\nscalar impurities\nIn this section we shall evaluate the coefficients of three-point functions of \u2206-BMN oper-\nators with arbitrary number of scalar impurities, and use this information to derive the\nsingle- double-trace two-point function of operators with an arbitrary number of scalar\nimpurities.\n5.1 The results in field theory\nEvery BMN operator with an arbitrary number of impurities can be decomposed into two\npieces. The pure BMN part, which contains no Z\u00af, and the compensating part, which\n22\ncontains Z\u00af. In order to make the structure of the general BMN operator clear, let us\nconsider the example of an operator with three impurities. The pure BMN part consists\nof two terms:\nOpure =\n\u2211\n0\u2264l2\u2264l3\nql22 q\nl3\n3 Tr(\u03c61Z\nl2\u03c62Z\nl3\u2212l2\u03c63Z\nJ\u2212l3) +\n\u2211\n0\u2264l3\u2264l2\nql22 q\nl3\n3 Tr(\u03c61Z\nl3\u03c63Z\nl2\u2212l3\u03c62Z\nJ\u2212l2) .\n(5.1)\nIn all cases \u03c61 is positioned first in the trace, while we have to sum over all the different\norderings of the remaining impurities. Let us denote by \u03c6p(i) the impurity which sits in\nthe ith position of a specific ordering of the impurities, and lp(i) the number of Z fields\nbetween \u03c61 and \u03c6p(i) (in the example given above p(2) = 2, p(3) = 3 for the first trace\nwhile p(2) = 3, p(3) = 2 for the second trace). Next we consider the compensating terms.\nIn our example, these should be written as\nOcomp = \u2212\u03b4\u03c62\u2261\u03c63\n\u2211\n0\u2264l2\n(q2q3)\nl2 Tr(\u03c61Z\nl2Z\u00afZJ\u2212l2)\u2212 \u03b4\u03c61\u2261\u03c62\n\u2211\n0\u2264l3\nql33 Tr(Z\u00afZ\nl3\u03c63Z\nJ\u2212l3)\n\u2212\u03b4\u03c61\u2261\u03c63\n\u2211\n0\u2264l2\nql22 Tr(Z\u00afZ\nl2\u03c62Z\nJ\u2212l2) . (5.2)\nIn other words, whenever two impurities in Opure are of the same flavour, we add a\ncompensating term where these two impurities are replaced by Z\u00af.\nWith this example in mind, it is not difficult to write down the most general form of\nan operator with n impurities,\nO{ni} \u2261\n1\u221a\nJn\u22121NJ+n\n\u2211\np=perm{2,...,n}\nO1p{ni} , (5.3)\nwhere i = 1, . . . , n and\nO1p(2)...p(n){ni}pure =\n\u2211\n0\u2264lp(2)\u2264lp(3)...\u2264lp(n)\nn\u220f\ni=2\nq\nlp(i)\np(i) Tr(\u03c61Z\nlp(2)\u03c6p(2)Z\nlp(3)\u2212lp(2)\u03c6p(3) . . . \u03c6p(n)Z\nJ\u2212lp(n)) ,\n(5.4)\nO1p(2)...p(n){ni}comp = \u2212\n1\n2\nn\u22121\u2211\nk=2\n\u03b4\u03c6p(k)\u2261\u03c6p(k+1)\n\u2211\n0\u2264lp(2)...\u2264lp(k)\u2264lp(k+2)...\u2264lp(n)\nn\u220f\ni=2,i6=p(k+1)\nq\nlp(i)\np(i) q\nlp(k)\np(k+1)\nTr(\u03c61Z\nlp(2)\u03c6p(2)...Z\nlp(k)\u2212lp(k\u22121)Z\u00afZ lp(k+2)\u2212lp(k)\u03c6p(k+2) . . . \u03c6p(n)Z\nJ\u2212lp(n))\n\u2212\u03b4\u03c61\u2261\u03c6p(2)\n\u2211\n0\u2264lp(3)...\u2264lp(n)\nn\u220f\ni=3\nq\nlp(i)\np(i) Tr(Z\u00afZ\nlp(3)\u03c6p(3) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03c6p(n)ZJ\u2212lp(n)) . (5.5)\nThe origin of the 1\n2\nin front of the first term of O1p(2)...p(n){ni}comp is quite clear. It comes from\nthe fact that we have counted twice the same term, since we have two orderings where\n23\n\u03c6p(i) and \u03c6p(i+1) coincide. The one with \u03c6p(i) coming first and \u03c6p(i+1) following and vice\nversa. Finally, we note that in principle more compensating terms should be added to the\nright hand side of (5.5) when two or more pairs of impurities coincide. These terms are\nirrelevant for our purposes in the BMN limit.\nIn the above expression, \u03c6p(i) \u2208 {\u03c61, \u03c62, \u03c63, \u03c64}. This makes the meaning of the Kro-\nnecker \u03b4-symbols functions obvious. It should also be noted that the operator given above\nis normalised so that its two point function is one at the free theory level.11\nAs in section 3, we will need the expressions for double-trace operators,\nT J,y{ni}{ki} = : O\nJ \u00b7y\n{ni}\n: : OJ \u00b7(1\u2212y){ki} : . (5.6)\nOn general grounds, the two-point function of the double- and single-trace BMN operators\ntakes the form\n\u3008T J,y{ni}{ki}(0) O\u00afJ{mi}(x)\u3009 = g2Cfree\n[\n1 + \u03bb\u2032 (a + b+ c) log(x\u039b)\u22122\n]\n. (5.7)\nIn (5.7) we have suppressed the indices of a, b and c. Here O\u00afJ{mi} contains p3 impuri-\nties, whereas the two single-trace expressions in T J,y{ni}{ki} contain p1 and p2 impurities,\nrespectively.\nCompared to (3.20), the above equation contains a new coefficient, c. This is due to\nthe fact that the second operator on the right hand side of (5.6) is no longer just the\nvacuum, but instead is a generic string state. This results in an additional logarithmic\npart for the three-point function (3.18), i.e. c \u00b7 log(x32\u039b)2).\nThe next step is to calculate the matrix of classical overlaps S. To this end, we\nwill need to compute the correlation functions of single-trace operators with double-trace\noperators to O(g2). We will not need the correlation functions of two different double-\ntrace operators, because these overlaps are of O(g22). Hence, it is possible to treat each\ndouble-trace operator independently and write the expressions (5.9), (5.13) and (5.14) as\ntwo by two matrices.\nThus the classical overlap is given by\nS = 1l + g2s , (5.8)\nwhere\ns =\n(\n0 Cfree\nCfree 0\n)\n, (5.9)\n11Strictly speaking this is true only when all the q\u2019s which correspond to a particular \u03c6, say \u03c61, are\ndifferent. This is the case that we are going to consider. However what follows can be applied with slight\nmodifications to the case where two or more of the q\u2019s are the same.\n24\nand\nCfree =\n\u2211\nperm\u2032\nCpfree , (5.10)\nwhere\nCpfree =\n(\u22121)p2\npip3\n\u221a\nyp1\u22121(1\u2212 y)p2\u22121J\np1\u220f\na=1\nsin(pimp(a)y)\nmp(a) \u2212 na\/y\np2\u220f\nb=1\nsin(pimp(b+p1)y)\nmp(b+p1) \u2212 kb\/(1\u2212 y)\n. (5.11)\nThe sum in (5.10) is over all the admissible permutations of the {mi}, which label the\nbarred BMN operator, as on the left hand side of (5.7). A permutation is admissible only\nwhen the permuted numbers belong to \u03c6\u2019s of the same flavour.\nOur next goal is to determine the anomalous dimension matrix T ,\nT = d+ g2t , (5.12)\nwhere the diagonal part d contains the anomalous dimensions, as in (3.24),\nd = \u03bb\u2032\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\u2211p3\na=1m\n2\na\/2 0\n0\n\u2211p1\na=1 n\n2\na\/2y\n2 +\n\u2211p2\na=1 k\n2\na\/2(1\u2212 y)2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 , (5.13)\nand\nt = \u03bb\u2032\n(\n0 t12\nt21 0\n)\n. (5.14)\nt12 can be read from (5.7), and is given by\nt12 =\n\u2211\nperm\u2032\nCpfree(a+ b+ c) . (5.15)\nThe coefficients a and c are given by the anomalous dimensions of the first and second\noperators in the definition of T ,\na =\np1\u2211\na=1\nn2a\n2y2\n, c =\np2\u2211\na=1\nk2a\n2(1\u2212 y)2 . (5.16)\nThe contributions of\n\u2211\nperm\u2032 C\np\nfree a and\n\u2211\nperm\u2032 C\np\nfree c to t12 in (5.15) factorise, to give\nCfree a , Cfree c , (5.17)\nrespectively.\nThe remaining contribution to t12 is\n\u2211\nperm\u2032 C\np\nfree b. It can be extracted from the\ncoefficient of the corresponding three-point function following the same logic as in section\n25\n3. These three-point functions of generic BMN operators with arbitrary numbers of scalar\nimpurities are computed in the following section. Our result is\n\u2211\nperm\u2032\nCpfree b =\n\u2211\nperm\u2032\nCpfree\n1\n2\n(\np1\u2211\na=1\nmp(a)\n(\nmp(a) \u2212 na\ny\n)\n+\np2\u2211\na=1\nmp(a+p1)\n(\nmp(a+p1) \u2212\nka\n1\u2212 y\n)\n+\n1\n2\np1\u2211\n(a,b)\n(mp(a) \u2212 na)(mp(b) \u2212 nb) + 1\n2\np2\u2211\n(a,b)\n(mp(p1+a) \u2212 ka)(mp(p1+b) \u2212 kb)\n+\n1\n2\np1\u2211\na=1\np2\u2211\nb=1\n(mp(a) \u2212 na)(mp(p1+b) \u2212 kb)\n)\n. (5.18)\nThe double sum summation notation (a, b) means that we do not distinguish between the\npair a, b and the pair b, a (a 6= b).\nAs in section 3, the anomalous dimension matrix \u0393 in the isomorphic to string basis\nis given by\n\u0393 = d+ g2t\n\u2032 , t\u2032 = t\u2212 1\n2\n{s, d} , (5.19)\nwhere\n{s, d} = \u03bb\u2032\n(\n0 Cfree(\u03b41 + \u03b42 + \u03b43)\nCfree(\u03b41 + \u03b42 + \u03b43) 0\n)\n, (5.20)\nand \u03b4i is the anomalous dimension of the i\nth operator (i = 1, 2, 3). After some algebra,\nwe obtain the final result:\n\u039312 =\n\u03bb\u2032g2\n4\n\u2211\nperm\u2032\nCpfree\n(\np1\u2211\na=1\n(\nmp(a) \u2212 na\ny\n)2\n+\np2\u2211\na=1\n(\nmp(a+p1) \u2212\nka\n1\u2212 y\n)2\n+\np1\u2211\n(a,b)\n(mp(a) \u2212 na)(mp(b) \u2212 nb) (5.21)\n+\np2\u2211\n(a,b)\n(mp(p1+a) \u2212 ka)(mp(p1+b) \u2212 kb) +\np1\u2211\na=1\np2\u2211\nb=1\n(mp(a) \u2212 na)(mp(p1+b) \u2212 kb)\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 .\nThis is our final expression for matrix elements in gauge theory. In the next section we\nwill compute the corresponding three-string amplitude and compare it to (5.21). We will\nfind perfect agreement.\n5.2 The results in string field theory\nIn this subsection we assemble the basic ingredients of the SFT calculation of the string\namplitude for states with an arbitrary number of scalar impurities. The amplitude has\n26\nthe form [7, 8] (we refer the reader to Appendix A for more details)\n\u3008\u03a6|P|VB\u3009 , (5.22)\nwhere \u3008\u03a6| represents the three external string states, |VB\u3009 is the kinematic part of the\nbosonic vertex (A.6), and the prefactor P is given by\nP = Cnorm\n3\u2211\nr=1\n\u221e\u2211\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03c9rn\n\u00b5\u03b1r\n\u03b1rI\u2020n \u03b1\nrI\n\u2212n . (5.23)\nCnorm is defined in such a way that we get agreement with the field theory calculation.\nIts value is taken to be\nCnorm = \u22121\n2\ng2\n\u221a\ny(1\u2212 y)\u221a\nJ\n(\u22121) 12\n\u22113\nr=1\n\u2211+\u221e\nm=\u2212\u221e \u03b1\nr I\u2020\nm \u03b1\nr I\nm . (5.24)\nThe prefactor can act on the external bra\u2013state and give a sum of 2p3 terms, each of which\nhas an external state identical to the initial \u3008\u03a6|, except one of the \u03b1n\u2019s which has changed\nto \u03b1\u2212n. Of course each of these terms is multiplied by the corresponding \u03c9rn\/\u00b5\u03b1r. What\nwe are left with is the action of the exponential in |VB\u3009. In order to keep the comparison\nto field theory as simple as possible, we choose a certain set of associations between the\nimpurities of the third string and the impurities of the other two strings. The final result\nwill be a sum over all possible such associations, i.e. permutations of this set.\nWhen an external oscillator has not been changed by the prefactor, the action of |VB\u3009\ngives a factor of N\u02c63rnan\u2032a where r = 1, 2, 3. But if the external oscillator has been changed\nby the prefactor, the action of |VB\u3009 gives a factor of\nF 3rna\u2212n\u2032a = N\u02c6\n3r\n\u2212nan\u2032a\n\u03c93na\n\u00b5\u03b13\n+ N\u02c63rna\u2212n\u2032a\n\u03c9rn\u2032a\n\u00b5\u03b1r\n= N\u02c63rna\u2212n\u2032a\n(\n\u03c93na\n\u00b5\u03b13\n+\n\u03c9rn\u2032a\n\u00b5\u03b1r\n)\n. (5.25)\nOne can evaluate F 3rna\u2212n\u2032a to get\nF 31na\u2212n\u2032a = (\u22121)na+n\n\u2032\na\n\u03bb\u2032\n2pi\n\u221a\ny\n(\nna \u2212 n\n\u2032\na\ny\n)2\nsin(pinay)\nna \u2212 n\u2032a\/y\n,\nF 32na\u2212n\u2032a = (\u22121)na+1\n\u03bb\u2032\n2pi\n\u221a\n1\u2212 y (na \u2212 n\n\u2032\na\/(1\u2212 y))2\nsin(pinay)\nna \u2212 n\u2032a\/(1\u2212 y)\n,\nF 33na\u2212n\u2032a = (\u22121)na+n\n\u2032\na+1\n2 sin(pinay) sin(pin\n\u2032\nay)\npi\u00b5\n,\nF 11na\u2212n\u2032a =\n2(\u22121)na+n\u2032a\n4pi\u00b5y\n,\nF 22na\u2212n\u2032a =\n2\n4pi\u00b5(1\u2212 y) .

(5.28)\nOne should note that in calculating the three string vertex we did not take into account\nterms where there were two contractions of oscillators belonging to the same string if the\nprefactor had not acted on one of these oscillators previously. This is so because these\nterms are of order (1\/\u00b5)4 = \u03bb\u20322, as can be easily seen.12\nIn order to get the final string theory result, we should not forget to sum (5.28) over\nall the admissible permutations, as we have done for the field theory result. This means\nthat the first line of (5.28) should be summed over all the possible permutations, while the\nremaining lines should be summed over all permutations except those which exchange the\nm\u2019s associated with the labels a and b (more precisely, the permutations which exchange\n12There is a subtlety in writing (5.28), since the Cp for each term in that equation are in fact different:\nto each term in (5.28) one should associate the Cp corresponding to the permutation of the indices which\nlabel m, n and k appearing in the term considered.\n28\nma with mb, mp1+a with mp1+b, ma with mp1+b in the second, third and fourth line of\n(5.28), respectively). Including these permutations would result in a double-counting.\nOnce this sums are performed, we obtain perfect agreement with the field theory result\n(5.21).\n6 A technical aside: calculation of general scalar BMN\nthree-point functions\nThis final section is devoted to the derivation of the expression (5.18).\nOur goal is to calculate \u3008OJ \u00b7y{ni}(x1)O\nJ \u00b7(1\u2212y)\n{ki}\n(x2) O\u00afJ{mi}(0)\u3009. To simplify the notation, we\nwill rename the operators in this Green\u2019s function as O1(x1), O2(x2) and O\u00af3(0). Let us\nassume that there are f\n(i)\n1 \u03c61\u2019s, f\n(i)\n2 \u03c62\u2019s, f\n(i)\n3 \u03c63\u2019s and f\n(i)\n4 \u03c64\u2019s in the i\nth operator where\ni = 1, 2, 3. We consider the case where f\n(3)\n1 = f\n(1)\n1 + f\n(2)\n1 with similar relations holding for\nthe other three impurities.\nThere are of course many different diagrams. In order to deal efficiently with them,\nlet us select a particular set of Wick contractions between the impurities of the barred\noperator and the impurities of the unbarred operators. Obviously, only impurities of the\nsame flavour can be contracted. The full result will then be a sum over all the different\npermutations of such contractions.\nWe start by considering the diagrams where the pure BMN part is taken in each\nof the three operators. These are drawn in Figure 7. It is easy to see that there are\nf\n(3)\n1 !f\n(3)\n2 !f\n(3)\n3 !f\n(3)\n4 ! different contributions. Let us select one of them and draw the corre-\nsponding diagrams, Figure 7, in which the ith \u03c61 field of O\u00af3(0) interacts with the nth \u03c61\nfield of O1(x1), while all the other fields are freely contracted. The phase factor associated\nwith these free contractions becomes, in the BMN limit:\nP2 =\np1\u220f\na6=n\nJ1\u2211\nla=1\n(q\u00afara)\nla\np2\u220f\nb=1\nJ\u2211\nlb=J1+1\n(q\u00afp1+bpb)\nlb\n=\np1\u220f\na6=n\nJ1\u2211\nla\ne\u22122pii(ma\u2212\nna\ny\n) la\nJ\np2\u220f\nb=1\nJ\u2211\nlb=J1+1\ne\u22122pii(mp1+b\u2212\nkb\n1\u2212y\n)\nlb\nJ\n= Jp3\u22121\np1\u220f\na6=n\n\u222b y\n0\ndxe\u22122pii(ma\u2212\nna\ny\n)x\np2\u220f\nb=1\n\u222b 1\ny\ndxe\u22122pii(mp1+b\u2212\nkb\ny\n)x\n= Jp3\u22121\np1\u220f\na6=n\ne\u2212piimay\nsin pimay\n(ma \u2212 na\/y)pi\np2\u220f\nb=1\ne\u2212piimp1+by\n(\u22121)p2 sin pimp1+by\n(mp1+b \u2212 kb\/(1\u2212 y))pi\n. (6.1)\n29\nRecall that (5.1), (5.2) and (5.4), (5.5) do not contain q1. In (6.1) and in what follows\nq1 is defined as q1 =\n\u220fJ\ni=2 q\u00afi, and qi = e\n2piimi\/J is the phase factor of the ith impurity (ra\nand pa are the phase factors of O1 and O2 respectively).\n\u03c6i\u03c6i\n\u03c6i \u03c6iZ\u00af Z\u00af\nZZ\n7a 7b\nFigure 7: Feynman diagrams where a scalar impurity from O1 interacts with a Z field.\nThe dots stand for impurities which have free contractions. These diagrams are also\naccompanied by their mirror images, where the interaction occurs in the bottom part of\nthe diagram.\nNote that in obtaining the above formula we have taken into account all the possible\norderings of the freely contracting impurities.\nWe also need the phase factor associated with the fields which are involved in the\ninteraction. This is given by\nP1 = (q\u00af\nJ1\ni \u2212 1)(q\u00afi \u2212 1)g2 =\n\u22124pimi\nJ\ne\u2212piimiy sin pimiy . (6.2)\nThe total phase factor will be P = P1P2\n13 Taking into account the normalisation of the\noperators, and evaluating the space-time integral associated with the vertex (see (D.1)),\none gets:\nG\n(1)\n3 =\nJp3\nN\n\u221a\nJp3\u22121Jp1\u221211 J\np2\u22121\n2\np1\u220f\na6=n\nsin pimay\nma \u2212 na\/y\np2\u220f\nb=1\nsin pimp1+by\nmp1+b \u2212 kb\/(1\u2212 y)\n(\u22121)p2\n(\u2212\u03bb\u2032)mi sin pimiy\n4pip3\nlog\nx21x\n2\n2\nx212\n.

We denoted by\n13In this section the Lagrangian and Feynman rules of [31] are used.\n30\nG\n(1)\n3 the part of the three-point function which corresponds to the diagrams of Figure 7,\nand by p3 = p1 + p2 the number of the impurities of O3.\nIn order to make easier the comparison with the string theory result, we rewrite (6.3)\nas\ng2C\np\nfreeb\n(1) =\nJp3\nN\n\u221a\nJp3\u22121Jp1\u221211 J\np2\u22121\n2\nk\u220f\na6=n\nsin pimay\nma \u2212 na\/y\np2\u220f\nb=1\nsin pimp1+by\nmp1+b \u2212 kb\/(1\u2212 y)\n(\u22121)p2mi sin pimiy\n2pip3\n. (6.4)\nEquation (6.4) corresponds to the first term in the first line of (5.18). Until now we have\nconsidered only diagrams where the interacting \u03c6 belongs to the operator O1. Of course,\nthere are diagrams where it is an impurity in O2 which interacts. These contributions\nproduce the second term in the first line of (5.18).\nNow we consider the diagrams in Figure 8.

In the case where two \u03c61\u2019s interact, the number\nof different diagrams is f\n(3)\n1 !f\n(3)\n2 !f\n(3)\n3 !f\n(3)\n4 !\nf\n(1)\n1 (f\n(1)\n1 \u22121)\n4\n. This number is obtained as follows.\nThere are f\n(1)\n1 (f\n(1)\n1 \u22121)\/2 different ways to single out two \u03c61\u2019s from the operator O1. This\nshould be multiplied by the f\n(3)\n1 (f\n(3)\n1 \u22121)\/2 different ways in which we can choose two \u03c61\u2019s\nfrom the barred operator O\u00af3, times the number (f (3)1 \u2212 2)!f (3)2 !f (3)3 !f (3)4 ! of independent\nfree contractions of all the remaining impurities.\n31\nEvaluating the phase factor associated with the interacting fields we get\nP1 = (q\u00af\nJ1\ni \u2212 1)(q\u00afJ1j \u2212 1)g2.

(6.8)\nThis term corresponds to the first term of the second line in (5.18). There are also\ndiagrams where we consider the pure BMN part in O1 and the compensating part in O2\n(rather than the opposite). These terms produce the second term in the second line of\n(5.18).\nWe now consider the last set of diagrams, which are represented in Figure 9. In order\nto draw these diagrams we have used (5.4) for the operators O1, O2, and (5.4), (5.5) for\nthe barred operator. In these diagrams the xth \u03c61 belongs to O1, while the zth \u03c61 belongs\nto O2.\nIn this case the phase factor associated with the fields which interact becomes\nP1 = (q\u00af\nJ1\ni \u2212 1)(q\u00afJ1j \u2212 1)(\u2212g2) .

The\ncombination \u03b1\u2032p+ for the r-th string is denoted \u03b1r and\n\u22113\nr=1 \u03b1r = 0. As is standard in\nthe literature, we will choose a frame in which \u03b13 = \u22121\n\u03b1r = \u03b1\n\u2032p+(r) : \u03b13 = \u22121, \u03b11 = y, \u03b12 = 1\u2212 y. (A.1)\nIn terms of the U(1) R-charges of the BMN operators in the gauge theory three-point\nfunction, \u3008OJ11 OJ22 O\u00afJ3 \u3009 we have\ny =\nJ1\nJ\n, 1\u2212 y = J2\nJ\n, y \u2208 (0, 1) , (A.2)\nand J = J1 + J2.\nThe effective SYM coupling constant (1.2) in the frame (A.1) takes the simple form\n\u03bb\u2032 =\n1\n(\u00b5p+\u03b1\u2032)2\n\u2261 1\n(\u00b5\u03b13)2\n=\n1\n\u00b52\n. (A.3)\nHere \u00b5 is the mass parameter which appears in the pp-wave metric, in the chosen frame\nit is dimensionless14 and the expansion in powers of 1\/\u00b52 is equivalent to the perturbative\nexpansion in \u03bb\u2032. Finally, the frequencies are defined via\n\u03c9rm =\n\u221a\nm2 + (\u00b5\u03b1r)2 . (A.4)\nThe three-string vertex |H3\u3009 can be represented as a ket-state in the tensor product\nof three string Fock spaces. It has the form [7, 8]\n1\n\u00b5\n|H3\u3009 = P|VF \u3009|VB\u3009\u03b4\n( 3\u2211\nr=1\n\u03b1r\n)\n, (A.5)\nwhere the kets |VB\u3009 and |VF \u3009 are constructed to satisfy the bosonic and fermionic kine-\nmatic symmetries, and \u03b1r are defined in (A.1). The bosonic factor |VB\u3009 is given by\n|VB\u3009 = exp\n(\n1\n2\n3\u2211\nr,s=1\n\u221e\u2211\nm,n=\u2212\u221e\n8\u2211\nI=1\n\u03b1r I\n\u2020\nm N\u02c6\nrs\nmn\u03b1\ns I\u2020\nn\n)\n|0\u3009|0\u3009|0\u3009 , (A.6)\nwhere the N\u02c6 rsmn are the Neumann matrices in the BMN-basis of string oscillators.

The fermionic factor |VF \u3009 is not going to\nbe relevant for the present paper, where only external bosonic string states are considered.\nThe prefactor P is a polynomial in the bosonic and fermionic oscillators, and is deter-\nmined from imposing the remaining symmetries of the pp-wave background. The relevant\nfor us bosonic part of the prefactor, as determined by Spradlin and Volovich in [8], reads\nP = Cnorm\n3\u2211\nr=1\n\u221e\u2211\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03c9rn\n\u00b5\u03b1r\n\u03b1rI\u2020n \u03b1\nrJ\n\u2212n vIJ , (A.7)\nwhere vIJ = diag(1l4,\u22121l4), and the overall normalisation Cnorm is left undetermined.\nNotice that it is the expression for vIJ which leads to the relative minus sign between\nthe string amplitudes involving states with excitations along the two different SO(4)\u2019s as\ne.g. in (3.9) and (3.11).\nAppendix B: notation and conventions in gauge\ntheory\nWe write the bosonic part of the N = 4 Lagrangian as\nL = 2\ng2\nTr\n(\n1\n4\nF\u00b5\u03bdF\u00b5\u03bd +\n1\n2\n(D\u00b5\u03c6i)(D\u00b5\u03c6i)\u2212 1\n4\n[\u03c6i, \u03c6j][\u03c6i, \u03c6j]\n)\n, (B.1)\nwhere \u03c6i, i = 1, . . . , 6 are the six real scalar fields transforming under an R-symmetry\ngroup SO(6).
