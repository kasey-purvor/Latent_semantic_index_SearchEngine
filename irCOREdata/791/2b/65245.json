While there is a \ndeveloping literature in this area, there is currently no agreed set of criteria against \nwhich such activity can be measured. Without such criteria research in this area could \nbe conducted on a basis which makes comparison difficult. Hence, the initial \ncontribution of this paper is to construct such a set of criteria from the small business \nethics literature.  \n \nIn order to make an initial assessment of the criteria so derived, they were applied to \nU.K. Fair Trade organisations. Given that Fair Trade organisations have a requirement \nto abide by RBP criteria such as those set by the International Fair Trade Association \n(IFAT), such organisations provide a suitable purposive sample against which to \ninitially test the criteria. Equally, no such study has yet been undertaken on Fair Trade \norganisations and so the paper also makes a contribution to the developing literature \non Fair Trade.  \n \nThe paper, then, proceeds as follows. First, the literature related to RBP in SMEs is \nreviewed and from this a set of criteria is derived, together with a number of other \nvariables to be measured in such research. As the sample group is comprised of Fair \nTrade organisations there is a brief review of the Fair Trade literature before the \nmethod for the exploratory study is described and the results reported. A discussion \nfollows and implications both for RBP in small businesses and for Fair Trade \norganisations are drawn out. Suggestions for further research are identified. \n \n \nResponsible Business Practice in SMEs \n \nAlthough we have used the term RBP, and defend its use below, the literature on RBP \nin SMEs is, of course, set within the broader literature on Corporate Social \nResponsibility (CSR). The literature on CSR and SMEs is limited when compared \nwith the equivalent literature related to large business, but it is now burgeoning \u2013 see \nMoore & Spence (2006) for a summary. There is a general consensus, however, \nconcerning the danger of simply taking CSR as related to large companies and \napplying it to SMEs (CSR Magazine, 2002; Fassin, 2008; Graafland et al., 2003; \nJenkins, 2004; Southwell, 2004; Spence & Rutherfoord, 2003). While SMEs are, \nthemselves, not a homogenous group, it is clear that small is different and, generally, \ninformal (Fassin, 2008; Graafland et al., 2003, p.57). In some cases there is a link \nbetween the owner-manager and the firm and, hence, personal choices can affect \nactivities at the firm level (Spence & Rutherfoord, 2001, p.127). There is, therefore, at \nleast an implied link to entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial activity (Fassin, 2008; \nFisscher et al., 2005; Hannafay, 2003; Lahdesmaki, 2005; Wempe, 2005 and see also \nLepoutre & Heene, 2006, p.261-262), although this is not explored here directly since \nit relates more to a particular type of business person, (who generally pursues a \n 3 \ngrowth and profit-maximising strategy), than to SMEs\u201f attempts at integrating CSR \nwithin their activities. \n \nSMEs are not only informal and in some cases owner-manager driven, but another \nfactor emerging from the literature is that social relationships and networks can be an \nintegral part of the business (Spence & Rutherfoord, 2003, p.2). Indeed, Lawrence et \nal. (2006) refer to the use of networks as a method of encouraging SMEs to develop \nsustainable practices. Links to the community may well therefore be both an intrinsic \npart of how SMEs behave, and something to be encouraged, rather than something to \nbe regarded as a \u201ebolt-on\u201f activity. However, Curran et al. (2000) and Besser & Miller \n(2001) both found that community links are not necessarily such an intrinsic part of \nSME activity, so that such links, while desirable from a CSR viewpoint, cannot be \nassumed. The main point to emerge here, however, is that SMEs may well engage in \nsocially responsible practices without necessarily viewing such activity in this way. \nIndeed, while an early study showed that half of the European SMEs were involved, \nto different degrees, in external socially responsible causes (European Commission, \n2002), the extent to which these businesses would explicitly articulate that they were \ninvolved in such activity was less clear. \n \nTerminology \nThat SMEs may well be doing CSR without knowing it or calling it CSR, is linked to \nthe issue of terminology. Southwell (2004, p.100-101) discusses this and the problem \nof applying CSR directly to SMEs. While within the study she reports \u201ccorporate \nsocial responsibility\u201d was the most common phrase, it was not seen as the most \nappropriate. Jenkins (2004, p.52) suggests \u201cbusiness community interaction\u201d but this \nseems unduly restrictive to one particular dimension. Murillo & Lozano (2006, p.237) \nargue for \u201cresponsible competitiveness\u201d, a term which is recognised in a recent \nEuropean Parliament resolution on corporate social responsibility (though not specific \nto SMEs) (European Parliament 2007, p.4), while Lepoutre & Heene (2006) use \n\u201csmall business social responsibility\u201d. However, \u201cresponsible business practice\u201d was \na reasonably popular alternative term in the study on which Southwell reports and, \nwhen combined with her suggestions of emphasising the totality of this activity and \nsimilarly emphasising the pragmatic value to the business of such engagement, it \nseems to be appropriate. The same term also finds recognition in the European \nParliament resolution referred to above (European Parliament, 2007, p.5). This is \ntherefore used henceforth and abbreviated to RBP. \n \nClassifications \nA further issue in the literature is that various attempts have been made to classify \nSMEs in relation to RBP. Southwell (2004, p.99-101) classifies SMEs into six \ndifferent types: Ben & Anitas (social enterprises); Arthur Daleys (financially \noriented); One-offs (relatively minimal experience of engagement with RBP); DIYers \n(fiercely independent); smart pragmatists (recognise the business benefits of RBP); \nand enlightened pragmatists (similar to smart pragmatists but \u201cmotivated by broader, \nlong-term, societal goals\u201d (ibid., p.99)). Spence & Rutherfoord (2001) provide a \ndifferent classification based on profit-maximising versus profit-satisficing \nperspectives on one dimension and socially active versus socially inactive practices \non the other. Their resultant 2x2 matrix identifies profit maximisation; subsistence; \nenlightened self-interest; and social priority as four different types. A further \nclassification is based on a simple dichotomous division between \u201cchampions\u201d for \n 4 \nRBP (Jenkins, 2006) or, alternatively, SMEs that are \u201cactive\u201d in social and \nenvironmental actions (Murillo & Lozano, 2006) compared with those that are neither \nchampions nor active.  \n \nStrategies for organising RBP \nGraafland et al. (2003) draw on the work of others and identify three different \nstrategies for organising ethics (whether in SMEs or otherwise). First is the \ncompliance strategy where the focus is on required behaviour. Second is the integrity \nstrategy that relies on the responsibility and integrity of individual employees but \nbased on clearly defined core values and training to enable employees to apply these \nvalues. Third is the dialogue strategy which pays attention to the expectations of the \nstakeholders of the firm and \u201cfocuses on responsiveness to the ideas, interests and \nvalues of others\u201d (Graafland et al., 2003, p.47). Although these strategies are \ncomplementary, their research findings suggest that, where any kind of strategy is \nused by SMEs, the dialogue strategy predominates (37%) over the integrity strategy \n(19%) and the compliance strategy (7%).  \n \nThis suggests that SMEs may be more \u201csocializing\u201d in their approach to RBP, \nincorporating \u201ca dialogic approach to accountability based on reciprocal relationships \nof mutual dependency\u201d (Spence, 2004, p.120). The alternative \u201cindividualizing\u201d \napproach would rely on more formal accountability mechanisms such as \u201csocial and \nenvironmental accounts and audits and corporate governance and various legal \nframeworks to protect processes of disclosure of unethical practices\u201d (ibid., p.119-\n120). Spence (ibid., p.125) confirms the socialising nature of accountability to \nemployees through dialogue and continuity of employment and also integrity towards \nclients and competitors where, particularly in relation to clients, relationships with the \nowner-manager may well be on first name terms. Both Graafland et al. (2003) and \nSpence (2004) therefore indicate the predominance of dialogic relationships in SMEs \nwith informality rather than formality (Gray et al., 2006) likely to be evident in \nrelation to RBP in SMEs. Fassin (2008), arguing from a practitioner perspective, is \nvehement in his defence of retaining the informality of RBP in SMEs. \n \nCriteria for RBP in SMEs \nWith this as background we turn to identifying a set of criteria against which to judge \nRBP in SMEs. While the informal, dialogic approach to RBP in SMEs might seem to \nsuggest that establishing criteria runs counter to this by apparently formalising RBP, it \nis clear both from the literature and from practice that some criteria can be \nestablished, and certainly for research purposes such criteria are clearly necessary. \nThe establishment of such criteria does not, of course, determine the research method \nthat might be used to identify whether the criteria are being satisfied in any particular \nSME (see Spence & Rutherfoord (2003) and Moore & Spence (2006) for discussions \nof appropriate research methods). Although in the exploratory study reported below \nthe use of web-site disclosure and self-reports are used to determine whether the \ncriteria are being met, ethnographic methods may well be suited to exploring the way \nin which some of the criteria are actually met. Equally, surveys might be an \nappropriate method. \n \nIn determining a set of criteria, then, in addition to items to be included from the \npreceding discussion, the most helpful criteria are found within European \nCommission (2002), Graafland et al. (2003), Jenkins (2004), Lahdesmaki (2005), \n 5 \nSouthwell (2004), Small Business Service (2002) and Spence (2004). Tencati et al. \n(2004) also provide a comprehensive list of criteria, although these are not specific to \nSMEs. Jenkins (2006, p.248) and Perrini et al. (2007, p.297-8) also provide lists of \ncriteria. Neither of these papers was available at the outset of this research, though in \nboth cases the broad categories (mainly stakeholder groupings) are consistent with \nthose used here. Drawing from the available sources, a comprehensive set of criteria \ncontaining 16 variables was derived,\n1\n and are shown in Table 1. In drawing together \nthe RBP criteria it was immediately noted that several of these may have little \nrelevance to the U.K. as opposed to the European context from which they were \ndrawn. However, it was decided to include all the criteria in the exploratory study and \nto comment further once the empirical data from the study was available. \n \nFour key groupings emerged from the criteria as follows: \n Governance of RBP \n Employees in the organisation \n Stakeholder relationships \n External reporting and monitoring \n \nThe 16 criteria are not split equally between the four identified groupings, but rather \neach grouping reflects the common element arising from a collection of discrete \nvariables. The groupings demonstrate the holistic approach to RBP from an internal \norganisation perspective (governance and employees) and to the external environment \n(stakeholder relationships and reporting and monitoring). Within the current SME \nliterature itself the groupings identified are recognised but as separate areas. For \ninstance, concerning governance and SMEs, see Abor & Biekpe (2007) and Gray \n(2006); for employees, see Devins et al. (2004) and Bacon & Hoque (2005); for \nstakeholder relationships, see Kusyk & Lozano (2007); and for reporting, see Fassin \n(2008). Drawing these previously discrete groupings together provides a suggested \nframework with a holistic view of RBP in SMEs. \n \n \n Criterion Description Search terms \n  Governance of RBP  \n1 Profit motive Degree to which the maximisation of \nprofit is not a clear priority or is regarded \nas a constraint rather than a priority \nprofit(s) \n2 Code of \nconduct \nCode of ethics, values statement \/ rules \nof conduct \nCode of conduct \n3 Ethics \ncommittee \nA committee with responsibility for \nimplementation and monitoring of a code \nof conduct or ethical matters in general \nethics committee \n4 Board member  Member of the Board with specific \nresponsibility for ethics issues \nethics director \n  Employees in the organisation  \n5 Staff handbook Internal document clarifying the position \nof employees on labour conditions, rules \netc. \nstaff handbook \n6 Training for \nemployees \nTraining in relation to codes of ethics and \ntheir application \nethics training \n 6 \n7 Responsibility \ntowards \nemployees \nSkill development \nWork-life balance \nHealth and well-being \nemployee \nemployee welfare \nemployee skills \nemployee health \nemployee well-\nbeing \nstaff \nstaff welfare \nstaff skills \nstaff health \nstaff well-being \n8 Confidential \nperson \nSomeone independent to whom \nemployees can turn \nmentor \nconfidential \nperson \n  Stakeholder relationships  \n9 Responsibility \ntowards the \nenvironment \nEnvironmental policy \nRecycling \nReducing waste \nenvironment(al) \nsustainable(ility) \n10 Responsibility \ntowards the \ncommunity \nSupport sporting activities \nSupport cultural activities \nSupport health and welfare activities \nSupport educational and training \nactivities \nGive preference to personnel from \nsocially deprived groups when recruiting \nParticipate in public affairs or political \nprocess on behalf of the enterprise \ncommunity(ies) \n \n11 Responsibility \ntowards \nsuppliers \nEthical sourcing policy and practices supplier(s) \nproducer(s) \n12 Responsibility \ntowards \ncustomers \/ \nclients \nProduct \/ service safety \nProduct \/ service quality \nPricing \/ Value for money \nCustomer satisfaction \nMarketing information \ncustomer(s) \nclient(s) \n13 Responsibility \ntowards \ncompetitors \nBehave responsibly in relation to \ncustomers \nCollaborate appropriately \ncompetitor(s) \n \n  External reporting and monitoring  \n14 Certification ISO 9001 (quality) \nISO 14001 (environmental) \nInvestors in People \nISO9001 \nISO14001 \ninvestor(s) in \npeople \n15 Communication \nwith \nstakeholders \nCommunication with: \nEmployees \nExternal shareholders \nCustomers \nSuppliers \nGovernment (local or national) \nMedia \nstakeholder(s) \n 7 \n16 Social report Publication of an (annual) audit of social \nand environmental impacts \nsocial report \nsocial account(s) \nenvironmental \nreport \n \nTable 1 Criteria for RBP by grouping \n \nOther variables \nIn addition to these criteria other variables need to be considered. Graafland et al. \n(2003, p.52), in their survey of large and small firms in The Netherlands, found that in \nall the instruments they identified for organising RBP (code of conduct; ISO 9001 \/ \n14001 certification; NEVI code (a code of conduct for suppliers); social report; staff \nhandbook; confidential person; ethics committee; member of the board responsible for \nethical issues; and ethical training) small firms typically used these far less than large \nfirms. When correlated against size (number of employees) there was a statistically \nsignificant difference (p<.05) in relation to ISO certification, social reports, staff \nhandbook and confidential person. Thus, while these criteria are potentially \nappropriate for SMEs in general it would not be surprising if there were to be a \ncorrelation with size, with differences in RBP between micro, small and medium \nsized enterprises. Independence is clearly also an issue with Graafland et al. (2003) \nfinding that subsidiaries generally performed better on most of the instruments, \nindicating that a form of direct \u201eethics supply chain\u201f has an effect on RBP. Other \nstudies in the area of corporate versus social performance (see Moore (2001), Moore \n& Robson (2002) for a summary) have confirmed the size relation but also found age \nto be a factor in social performance among large firms, and this might similarly be \nexpected to be a factor for SMEs; the older an SME the more likely that RBP might \nhave become embedded within the firm. Thus, size, independence and age are also \nvariables to be included in any empirical study. \n \n \nFair Trade organisations \n \nIn order to make an initial empirical assessment of the criteria for RBP in SMEs that \nhad been derived it was decided to focus on U.K. Fair Trade organisations. To \ncontextualise Fair Trade, the U.K., which has the largest retail value of Fair Trade \ngoods carrying the Fairtrade Mark in Europe (Krier, 2006, p.15), had an annual \nturnover of such goods of \u00a3493m (circa \u20ac600m) in 2007 with more than 3,000 \nproducts available. All major supermarket chains in the U.K. sell Fair Trade products \ntogether with many smaller stores and catering operations (www.fairtrade.org.uk, \naccessed 26 September 2008). A summary of the development, parameters and issues \nfacing Fair Trade from an academic perspective is contained in Moore (2004) and \nsimilarly from a practitioner perspective in Wills (2006) (and see also IDC (2007) , \nNicholls & Opal (2005) and Raynolds et al. (2007)). In practice, all Fair Trade \norganisations are small or medium-sized businesses (SMEs) within the generally \naccepted definition of up to 250 employees (European Commission, 2003)\n2 \nand so \nprovide a relevant population. \n \nThe accepted definition of Fair Trade is as follows: \n \n 8 \n\u201cFair Trade is a trading partnership, based on dialogue, transparency and \nrespect, that seeks greater equity in international trade. It contributes to \nsustainable development by offering better trading conditions to, and securing \nthe rights of, marginalized producers and workers \u2013 especially in the South. \nFair trade organisations (backed by consumers) are engaged actively in \nsupporting producers, awareness raising and in campaigning for changes in the \nrules and practice of conventional international trade.\u201d  (FINE, 2001)3 \n \nThis definition has, in essence, two basic components. The first is to provide a \nworking model of international trade that makes a difference to the producers and \nconsumers that engage in it and to do so in such a way that social objectives \u2013 better \ntrading conditions, the securing of rights and the development of consumer \nconsciousness in the North \u2013 are met (see Hayes (2006) and Hayes & Moore (2005) \nfor an understanding of how the economics of Fair Trade works in practice). The \nsecond and more radical component of Fair Trade is to challenge orthodoxy in \nbusiness practice: to be a \u201ctool for modifying the dominant economic model\u201d \n(Renard, 2003, p.91) and encourage it towards more social ends. It is, of course, this \nsecond component that links with RBP and suggests that Fair Trade organisations \nmight be expected to fall into the social enterprise, social priority and champion \/ \nactive categories identified above. Thus, as a homogenous group with an explicitly \nethical approach to business, they form a suitable purposive population in which to \nfind evidence of the applicability and use of the RBP criteria.  \n \nHowever, whether Fair Trade as it has emerged into the mainstream is better able to \ninfluence conventional business practice remains open to debate. Low & Davenport \n(2006) argue that rather than the mainstream adopting Fair Trade practices, Fair Trade \nhas simply been assimilated into mainstream commercial trade where it \u201cwill remain a \nsmall, lucrative niche\u201d (p.322). But with Traidcraft and Caf\u00e9direct (two of the case \nstudy organisations in this exploratory study) occupying 6\nth\n and 7\nth\n= of the most \nethically perceived brands in the U.K. in a GfK NOP consumer survey,\n4\n it seems that \nconsumers identify Fair Trade organisations as ethical businesses. The challenge, \nhowever, may be to maintain that position against critics who would wish to see them \nfall from that high pedestal. Hence again the importance of RBP practices within U.K. \nFair Trade organisation would seem to be self-evident. We will return to this issue in \nthe discussion.  \n \nExploratory study \n \nFor the purposes of this study the Fair Trade umbrella organisation of interest was \nIFAT since this focuses on organisations and sets standards for membership that have \nsome parallels with more general RBP criteria. (The alternative umbrella organisation, \nFLO, also provides certification standards but these are focused on products rather \nthan organisations \u2013 see Moore (2004).)5  The nine IFAT standards (IFAT, 2005) that \nwere in place at the commencement of the empirical work involved in this study are \nshown in Appendix 1.\n6\n  The standards cover: creating opportunities for economically \ndisadvantaged producers; transparency and accountability; capacity building; \npromoting Fair Trade; payment of a fair price; gender equity; working conditions; \nchild labour; and environment. It can be seen from this that these standards follow in \nsome respects conventional RBP criteria, but unsurprisingly have a focus on particular \naspects of Fair Trade and its concern with marginalised producers and workers in the \n 9 \nSouth. Within the Fair Trade movement there is a belief that these Fair Trade \nstandards are superior to conventional RBP criteria.\n7  \nHowever, it is also clear that in \nsome respects the Fair Trade standards differ from such RBP criteria. \n \nThe primary data collection for the exploratory study comprised two stages. Stage one \nwas based on web-site disclosures against the RBP criteria. This was followed up in \nstage two by direct requests for further information about compliance with these \ncriteria. At the start of the collection period an initial listing of all the U.K. listed \nIFAT members was extracted from the IFAT membership list (www.ifat.org).  For the \nU.K. there were 16 organisations listed and from this the 11 trading organisations \nwere selected for this study as shown in Table 2 below.\n8\n  \n \n \nBishopston Trading \nCompany \nBookchair Company Caf\u00e9direct \nDivine Chocolate Ltd. Equal Exchange Trading  One World Shop \nShared Earth Shared Interest Traidcraft \nTropical Forest Products Tropical Wholefoods  \n \nTable 2.  IFAT U.K. Fair Trade organisations included in the study \n \nGiven the small number of organisations in the sample, this serves as an exploratory \nstudy only to assess the RBP criteria developed above, to provide observations on \ntheir applicability to U.K. Fair Trade organisations and more widely to serve as an \ninitial observation on their applicability to SMEs as a whole.   \n \nThe web-sites of all of the organisations included in the study were reviewed to \nidentify RPB criteria disclosure based on key words. The key words themselves were \nselected from a prior study of Traidcraft\u201fs web-site and are shown in Table 1. Two \ncoding decisions were made against the criteria, firstly a binary present\/not present \nand secondly, where the criterion was present, the number of associated \u201chits\u201d so \nproviding volumetric data. As well as providing some direct outputs, this preliminary \ndisclosure analysis also performed another function in providing an entr\u00e9e to the \norganisations themselves.  \n \nThe second stage of data collection took place after the web-site coding had been \nperformed and the data analysed. The request to each organisation was partly to \ncomment on the web-site analysis (which was tailored to each organisation), but \nmainly to supply existing documents such as annual reports, social reports, or to \nprovide files or other material. There was no limit placed on which documents or \nevidence could be supplied, only a request that they should not be written specifically \nfor the purpose of this survey. The responses complied with this request and were \nconsequently a mixture of hard copy documents, comments by e-mail and electronic \nfile attachments.  \n \nNon-response bias \nOrganisations that did not respond to the original request to provide further data were \ncontacted by e-mail a second time and in all five organisations responded. Although \nthe response rate was somewhat disappointing given the personal nature of the \napproach used, there was no evidence of response bias.  \n 10 \n \n \nResults \n \nWeb-site analysis \nThe results of the web-site analysis against the RBP criteria are shown in Figure 1. \nThe graph shows \u201cPresent\u201d referring to whether a web-site provided disclosure \nagainst that criterion. The results are expressed as a percentage of all organisations. \nNumbers of \u201chits\u201d (i.e. the number of times a particular criterion was disclosed) are \nalso shown and are reported as a percentage of the total number of hits and thus sum \nto 100%. Two of the web-sites were \u201cretail only\u201d, i.e. they were directed entirely at \nselling products rather than giving organisational information. Nonetheless, there was \nsome incidental disclosure even on these sites and, as the public face of these \norganisations, their results were included in the analysis.  \n \nSome criteria, as anticipated, have no disclosure against them which may suggest that \nthese are not culturally appropriate in the U.K. (e.g. having a Board member \nresponsible for ethics). On the other hand, one might expect Fair Trade organisations \nto have an ethics committee, but this is not the case according to the web-sites. \nEnvironment, community and suppliers dominate the \u201chits\u201d with employees and \ncustomers following. In total, against all criteria for all organisations (i.e. 16 x 11), the \ndisclosure rate was 49.6%. \n \n \nFigure 1.  RBP criteria by importance \n  \nFollow-up request for further data \nThe responses to the request for further data were analysed by considering each \ncomment, document or file in turn and recording evidence concerning compliance \nagainst the RBP criteria. While this could be considered as a self-reporting disclosure \nstudy, the compliance with the request to provide existing documents and not to \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nPr\nof\nit\nC\nod\ne \nof\n c\non\ndu\nct\nEt\nhi\ncs\n c\nom\nm\nitt\nee\nB\noa\nrd\n m\nem\nbe\nr\nSt\naf\nf h\nan\ndb\noo\nk\nTr\nai\nni\nng\nEm\npl\noy\nee\ns\nC\non\nfid\nen\ntia\nl p\ner\nso\nn\nEn\nvi\nro\nnm\nen\nt\nC\nom\nm\nun\nity\nSu\npp\nlie\nrs\nC\nus\nto\nm\ner\ns\nC\nom\npe\ntit\nor\ns\nC\ner\ntif\nic\nat\nio\nn\nC\nus\nto\nm\ner\ns\nSo\nci\nal\n re\npo\nrt\n%\nPresent\nHits\nGovernance of RBP\nEmployees in the \norganisation Stakeholder relationships\nExternal reporting \nand monitoring\n 11 \nanswer a survey provides some reassurance that what is being measured is genuinely \nperformance rather than merely disclosure. In this case no volumetric analysis was \nconducted, the point being to assess whether there was sufficient evidence to show \nthat criteria that had previously been recorded as not met according to the web-site \nanalysis were, in fact, being met. \n \nThe findings were in line with what had been expected. On RBP criteria the \ncompliance rate increased from 32.5% (well below the average for all organisations\u201f \nweb-sites of 49.6% noted above) to 57.5% following full disclosure. This is a \nsignificant rise in itself and to well above the average for all organisations based only \non their web-site disclosure. In particular, criteria related to profit levels, codes of \nconduct (which could include a values statement), the presence of staff handbooks, \nresponsibility to employees, responsibility to the community (interpreted as local to \nthe organisation in the U.K. rather than communities in developing countries), \nresponsibility to customers, and communication with stakeholders all became much \nmore evident where previously the web-sites had not disclosed very much against \nthese criteria. The results are shown in Figure 2. \n \n \nFigure 2 RBP criteria \u2013 follow-up respondents only \n \nIn relation to the groupings identified above, the picture is mixed. The governance of \nRBP is evident to some extent but with no ethics committees. Employees in the \norganisation is also evident but with no training for employees. Stakeholder \nrelationships was the strongest grouping with only competitors having a limited \nresponse. External reporting and monitoring is also evident but, not surprisingly, \ncommunication with stakeholders dominates this grouping.  \n \nThere could be some confusion or reluctance to identify other Fair Trade \norganisations as competitors rather than collaborators in a movement given the \nnetwork they form, so it is possible that the low response rate here is explicable. In \nrelation to the two criteria against which there was no evidence, it is entirely \nreasonable to suppose that for these particular organisations, with their strong ethical \nbasis in being part of the Fair Trade movement, the requirement to formalise ethics \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nP\nro\nfit\nC\nod\ne \nof\n c\non\ndu\nct\nE\nth\nic\ns \nco\nm\nm\nitt\nee\nB\noa\nrd\n m\nem\nbe\nr\nS\nta\nff \nha\nnd\nbo\nok\nTr\nai\nni\nng\nE\nm\npl\noy\nee\ns\nC\non\nfid\nen\ntia\nl p\ner\nso\nn\nE\nnv\niro\nnm\nen\nt\nC\nom\nm\nun\nity\nS\nup\npl\nie\nrs\nC\nus\nto\nm\ner\ns\nC\nom\npe\ntit\nor\ns\nC\ner\ntif\nic\nat\nio\nn\nC\nom\nm\nun\nic\nat\nio\nn\nS\noc\nia\nl r\nep\nor\nt\n%\nGovernance of RBP\nEmployees in the \norganisation Stakeholder relationships\nExternal reporting \nand monitoring\n 12 \nissues by an ethics committee, for example, or by providing specific ethics training to \nemployees, is considered irrelevant. That only two organisations had a code of \nconduct \u2013 and in both cases this was a values statement rather than a full code that \nmight be found in larger firms \u2013 seems to confirm this. Only two organisations, \nhowever, had a confidential person in place to whom employees could turn. In line \nwith good whistle-blowing practice this might be an area for further consideration. \nThat two organisations were engaged in social reporting (and, indeed, one of these \u2013 \nTraidcraft \u2013 has won awards for its social reports), suggests that social reporting is not \nnecessarily beyond SMEs, in contrast with Fassin\u201fs (2008) claims that social reporting \nis inappropriate for SMEs. \n \nAs noted above, then, these findings confirm what had been expected \u2013 that these \norganisations were, in practice, more fully engaged in RBP activities than their web-\nsites had indicated.  \n \nAge, size and independence \nThe organisations are all independent of parent companies, the one exception being \nDivine Chocolate Ltd. (http:\/\/www.divinechocolate.com, accessed 25 September \n2008) which is owned by a combination of Kuapa Kokoo (the cocoa farmers which \nsupply it), Twin Trading and Oikocredit (an international development finance \ninstitution). In addition Christian Aid owns preference shares. This interesting \nstructure is unique amongst the organisations surveyed but it does not match with \nconventional ownership which is the usual criterion against which independence is \njudged. Hence, no analysis of the results against independence was possible. Analyses \nagainst size (turnover) and age (years since foundation) showed no statistically \nsignificant correlation for either the web-site disclosure or the full responses from the \nfive organisations. A larger and more diverse population would, therefore, be needed \nto enable analysis of these variables. \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nThe sample \nSMEs can be viewed as a disparate mix of businesses being far more informal in \norganisational structure, internal reporting and lines of communication when \ncompared to large businesses. Emerging from such characteristics it is fair to say that \nSMEs are not homogeneous, are sometimes driven by owner-manager values, and so \ncan be difficult to compare directly both to each other and certainly against larger \nbusinesses. Jenkins (2004, p.40) has already highlighted this problem with SME \nresearch in that \u201cusually underlying these discussions are certain suppositions that \nmay not apply to the average SME\u201d. \n \nOne aspect of this exploratory study is that the fundamental values of the businesses \nexamined are shared, with Fair Trade values underpinning all of the organisations in \nthis study. Within this study, then, there was no need to overlay or identify a values \nmatrix approach around differentiating characteristics as suggested in Southwell\u201fs \n(2004) typology or Spence and Rutherfoord\u201fs (2001) classification, referred to above. \nThus, as noted above, this sample falls entirely within the \u201cBen and Anitas\u201d type or \nthe \u201csocial priority\u201d class, and could similarly be characterised amongst the \n\u201cchampions for CSR\u201d (Jenkins, 2006). However, this means that the results from this \n 13 \nstudy are not necessarily transferable to other types of SME, though they should be \ndirectly comparable with other SMEs of their type. However, as a means of exploring \nRBP criteria the sample was appropriate. \n \nRBP criteria and groupings \nThat 14 from the 16 criteria derived from the literature were found to be present in at \nleast one or more of the Fair Trade organisations when the detailed follow-up \nresponses were analysed, and that there may be reasonable explanations for the \nabsence of the other two criteria, suggests that these 16 criteria do form a sound basis \non which future research in this area might be conducted. While the concern about the \nformalisation of RBP in SMEs was noted above, it seems that such criteria are \nappropriate to and observable within SMEs.  \n \nHowever, the fact that the response rate was only 49.6% for the web-site disclosure \nrising to 57.5% for the full responses, indicates that only about half of these criteria \nare satisfied in the organisations studied. However, within the four groupings of \ncriteria that were identified, each has a majority of criteria present. Further studies \nshould both confirm the criteria themselves and give further data on the extent to \nwhich SMEs do comply with these criteria. Particular attention might be paid to those \ncriteria where no or limited evidence was provided of compliance and to other \nclassifications of SME to see whether they satisfy more or fewer criteria. Overall, \nhowever, the main contribution of the paper has been met \u2013 to derive a set of criteria \nfor RBP in SMEs and to conduct an initial empirical test to confirm their \napplicability. The grouping of the criteria into internal (governance of RBP and \nemployees) and external (stakeholder relationships and reporting and monitoring) \nareas may also be useful in emphasising these groupings over individual criteria \nwithin them.  \n \nUnder-reporting of RBP activity \nSMEs on their own have been viewed as insignificant in relation to influencing other \nbusinesses or stakeholders around them or through the supply chain. Jenkins (2006, \np.243) asserted that \u201cSMEs remain largely invisible\u201d in relation to RBP and, if this is \nthe case, then the broadening and adoption of RBP by others is made more difficult as \neven the champions of RBP remain largely hidden from view. This was borne out by \nJenkins\u201f (2006) study which specifically examined SME CSR champions and still \nconcluded that, \u201cmany companies were uncomfortable with the idea of promoting \ntheir CSR activities [which was] seen as a \u201cbig business\u201d thing to do\u201d (p. 250).  \n \nHowever, as one of the fundamental aims for Fair Trade is to raise social awareness \nand to challenge the orthodoxy in business practice, the level of reporting and \ndisclosure to help achieve these aims might be expected to be high in these \norganisations. Moreover, as all organisations in this study have a shared Fair Trade \nidentity from their IFAT membership, the problematic issue of their collective \nvisibility could be reduced due to the public recognition of Fair Trade goods and the \nFair Trade brand. Thus, such a collective SME group (a network) could galvanise \nRBP via a holistic approach rather than through the efforts of single entities. This \ncould lead to a common RBP message, but in order for this message and practice to \nbe seen and adopted by others it would need communication and wide disclosure. A \nsimilar approach could be advanced for industry specific or local groupings of SME \nto promote RBP as a group rather than it reside solely within individual entities. \n 14 \n \nHowever, allowing for the tentative nature of the web-site disclosure results, this \nstudy suggests that such dissemination of good practice is not, in general, taking place \nto the extent that might be expected. That performance for the five respondents in \ngeneral nearly doubled over their disclosure is evidence of this. This, however, \nconfirms results commonly found in other studies. Jenkins (2006) reported that, \u201conly \nthree companies [out of 24 in the study] reported on any aspect of their CSR and none \nreported annually\u201d (p. 249), and Murillo and Lozano (2006) found \u201cthe companies [all \nSMEs] \u2026 do not appear to communicate their social practices to any great extent\u201d \n(p.236). However, of interest is that one of the companies, Shared Interest, now has a \nspecific reference to CSR on its home page (www.shared-interest.com, accessed 25 \nSeptember 2008). \n \nLevel of RBP activity \nThe apparent under-disclosure of RBP activity, discussed above, needs to be \ncontrasted with the actual level of RBP performance. Whilst, as noted, some of the \ncriteria \u2013 such as having an ethics committee or providing ethics training \u2013 may not be \nappropriate either for these organisations in particular or in a U.K. context, there are a \nnumber of possible areas for consideration, based on the responses from the five \nrespondent organisations, in relation to developing RBP activities. These would seem \nto be important areas for Fair Trade organisations to attend to if their ability to \nchallenge mainstream organisations is not eventually to be undermined.  \n \nHowever, even allowing for these weaknesses, it is not clear from this analysis that \nLow & Davenport\u201fs (2006) argument that Fair Trade has simply been assimilated into \nmainstream commercial trade is supported. Fair Trade organisations do comply with a \nnumber of RBP criteria. Their emphasis on suppliers is evident, as would be expected, \nand this aspect in particular does challenge the mainstream about its own supply chain \npractices. Similarly, their focus on employees, communication with stakeholders and \nresponsibility to the environment (all five respondents meeting these criteria) is \nfurther evidence of good practice. While Fair Trade organisations could and probably \nshould do more to ensure compliance with general RBP criteria, the failings evident \nfrom this study do not suggest that their whole approach to the mainstream is \ncurrently undermined by their lack of attention to such criteria. \n \n \nConclusions  \n \nWe have derived from the literature a set of 16 criteria for RBP in SMEs grouped into \nfour categories (governance of RBP; employees in the organisation; stakeholder \nrelationships; external reporting and monitoring). Fourteen of the 16 RBP criteria \nwere found to be satisfied in at least one of the sample organisations. The two \nexceptions \u2013 the presence of an ethics committee and ethics training for employees \u2013 \nhave reasonable explanations as to why, in U.K. Fair Trade organisations, they might \nnot be satisfied. Hence, it seems reasonable to conclude that these 16 criteria should \nform the basis for further research. Such research, across a broader and international \nrange of SMEs, including those outside the Fair Trade movement, might help to \nconfirm or improve upon these 16 criteria and to assess whether the 57.5% \n\u201esatisfaction\u201f rating for the five respondent organisations is common in other groups \nof SMEs. Further research may also identify similarities or disparities in RBP practice \n 15 \nin relation to independence, size and age, and may provide evidence across sectors \nand in other geographic regions. \n \nIn relation to the Fair Trade organisations, development of their web-sites in relation \nto RBP criteria to more accurately reflect actual practice would seem to be a desirable \naction, together with some action on other RBP criteria where practice is currently \nlacking. This needs to recognise, however, that for some of these organisations the \nresource available to do this is limited and the focus is quite rightly on practical action \nin relation to Fair Trade rather than on RBP activities in general. Nonetheless, with \nthe broader objective of Fair Trade being to influence the mainstream, such RBP \ndisclosure and practice might be seen to be part of what a Fair Trade organisation \nshould be doing. However, there is insufficient evidence here to suggest that currently \nFair Trade\u201fs ability to influence the mainstream is undermined by deficiencies in such \npractice. \n \nFinally, the study reported here was intended only as exploratory within the U.K. in \norder to assess the appropriateness of the 16 RBP criteria. In relation to Fair Trade, \nthis study could be extended to all trading organisations in the IFAT fold. IFAT has \nalready been presented with the report and recommendations that were provided to the \norganisations that responded to the request for further information, and so is already \nin a position to recommend action to its members. The extension of this initial \nexploratory study to such a large, international and multi-lingual population would \npotentially provide a rich, comparative set of data from which more general \nconclusions could be drawn. \n \n \n 16 \nNotes \n \n1.

IFAT has since added a tenth criterion: \u201cTrade Relations: The organization trades \nwith concern for the social, economic and environmental well-being of marginalized \nsmall producers and does not maximise profit at their expense. It is responsible and \nprofessional in meeting its commitments in a timely manner. Suppliers respect \ncontracts and deliver products on time and to the desired quality and specifications. \nProducers and suppliers are paid in a timely manner and in line with agreements \nmade. Whenever possible and if help is required, producers are assisted with access to \npre-harvest or pre-production financing (advance payments). Buyers consult with \nsuppliers before cancelling or rejecting orders. Where orders are cancelled through no \nfault of producers or suppliers, adequate compensation is guaranteed for work already \ndone. The organization maintains long term relationships based on solidarity, trust \nand mutual respect that contribute to the promotion and growth of fair trade. It \nmaintains effective communication with its trading partners. Parties involved in a \ntrading relationship seek to increase the volume of the trade between them and the \nvalue and diversity of their product offer as a means of growing fair trade for the \nproducers. Buyers support processes which add value for producers in order to \nincrease their incomes. The organization works cooperatively with other FTO\u201fs in \ncountry and avoids unfair competition. It avoids duplicating the designs or patterns of \nother organizations without permission.\u201d (IFAT, 2008). \n7.
