Introduction\n[2] The ionospheric plasma in the crossed electric E and\ngeomagnetic B fields drifts with a velocity dependent on the\nelectron and ion collision frequencies and hence on the\naltitude. In the F region (above \u0001120 km), both plasma\nspecies drift with the E \u0002 B velocity VE, whereas in the\nE region (100\u2013120 km), where the ion-neutral collision\nfrequency ni exceeds the ion gyrofrequency Wi, the ion drift\nspeed Vi0 is several times smaller than that of the electrons\nVe0 ffi VE. Under strong electric field conditions, when Ve0\nexceeds the ion-acoustic speed Cs, the E-region plasma\nbecomes unstable and sustains electrostatic waves or irreg-\nularities [Farley, 1963; Buneman, 1963]. The instability that\ngives rise to the fluctuations has been termed the modified\ntwo-stream or the Farley-Buneman instability (FBI). The\nlinear fluid theory of the FBI predicts that in the ion frame\nof reference the FB waves are excited in a finite cone of\nflow angles q < q0, given by Ve0 cos q0 = Cs, and that at a\ngiven angle q the wave phase velocity Vph is proportional to\nthe line-of-sight (l-o-s or los) component of the electron\ndrift velocity Ve0\nC = Ve0 cos q: Vph = bVe0C, where the\ncoefficient b is close to 1 [Fejer and Kelley, 1980].\nFigure 1 illustrates the geometry of observations in the\nauroral E region with the flow angle q (the angle between\nwave propagation vector k and Ve0) shown by the black\nsector.\n[3] The plasma density irregularities with a specific\nwavelength lirr can be detected by Doppler coherent radars\nwith a frequency given by the Bragg condition, frad =\nc\/2lirr. The meter- and decameter-scale irregularities are\nroutinely observed by the VHF and HF coherent radars both\nat small (q < q0) and large (q > q0) flow angles, inside and\noutside the FBI flow angle cone. The generation of waves at\nlarge flow angles is attributed to the energy transfer from the\nlarge-scale and\/or inside-cone modes (see, e.g., the review\nby Farley [1985]). The phase velocity of outside-cone\nmodes is significantly more difficult to predict and is often\nassumed to be equal to the velocity given by the linear\ntheory, which was confirmed to some extent by numerical\nsimulations [Keskinen et al., 1979] and radar observations\n[e.g., Nielsen and Schlegel, 1985; Nielsen et al., 2002].\n[4] Small-scale irregularities are known to be highly\nmagnetic field aligned. The FB waves are most easily\nexcited perpendicular to the magnetic field direction and\nboth their growth rate and phase velocity are fast-decreasing\nfunctions of the magnetic aspect angle a (the angle between\nthe wave vector k and the plane perpendicular to the\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 112, A11303, doi:10.1029\/2007JA012342, 2007\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Physics, La Trobe University, Bundoora, Melbourne,\nVictoria, Australia.\n2Institute of Space and Atmospheric Studies, University of Saskatch-\newan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.\n3Department of Communication Systems, Lancaster University, Lan-\ncaster, UK.\n4Space Research Unit, Finnish Meteorological Institute, Helsinki,\nFinland.\nCopyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/07\/2007JA012342$09.00\nA11303 1 of 10\nmagnetic field B in Figure 1) so that no waves can be\nexcited in the linear regime at a > 1\u0001\u20131.5\u0001 [e.g., Haldoupis,\n1989]. Experimentally, it has been shown that the radar\nbackscatter power decreases (attenuates) quickly with in-\ncreasing distance between a given radar cell and the area\nwith minimum magnetic aspect angle a [e.g., Nielsen,\n1988]. The power attenuation rate varies with the aspect\nangle itself being larger at small a, and appears to depend\non the radar frequency as well, being larger at higher\nfrequencies [Haldoupis, 1989].\n[5] The E region irregularity velocity has also been\nshown to decrease with the aspect angle a, i.e., Vph \/\nb(a) is a decreasing function of a. At VHF, the velocity\ndecrease was found to be consistent with the prediction of\nthe linear fluid theory assuming that the electron-neutral\ncollision frequency ne in the expression for phase velocity\ngiven by the linear fluid theory is replaced by an anomalous\nvalue, n* = 6ne [Ogawa et al., 1980; Nielsen, 1986; Kustov\net al., 1994]. It was argued that the above substitution is\nconsistent with the notion that the irregularity phase veloc-\nity saturates at the ion-acoustic speed Cs owing to the wave-\nparticle interaction that effectively leads to an increase in\nthe electron collision frequency [Sudan, 1983]. It is gener-\nally accepted that the above argument and the theory by\nSudan [1983] provide a useful framework for interpreting\nthe observations, but some theoretical reservations have\nbeen expressed as well [Haldoupis, 1989; Robinson and\nHonary, 1990; Foster et al., 1992]. Unlike backscatter\npower, the irregularity velocity attenuation rates were found\nto be similar at different frequency ranges [Ogawa et al.,\n1980; Nielsen, 1986; Foster et al., 1992; Makarevitch et al.,\n2002].\n[6] The theory of Sudan [1983] contains one important\nprediction, i.e., that the anomalous collision frequency n*\nshould be a decreasing function of the flow angle q and that\nno increase should be observed at q = q0. To date, most\nexperimental studies of the aspect angle effects have con-\ncentrated on the observations at small flow angles, either\nclose to the Ve0 direction or without considering explicitly\ndifferent flow angles within a wide range of flow angles\ninside the cone. Moreover, it was often difficult to distin-\nguish between the flow and aspect angle effects [e.g., Foster\net al., 1992].Makarevitch et al. [2002] have used the L shell\nangle f (the angle between the radar l-o-s direction and\nmagnetic L shell direction, a predominant direction of the\nelectron flow, see Figure 1) as a proxy for the flow angle.\nThey have considered two ranges of L shell angles and\nfound that the decrease of the HF E region velocity with the\nexpected aspect angle was slower at larger f, an opposite\nresult to the prediction of Sudan [1983].\n[7] Makarevitch et al. [2002] also found that at the largest\nangles f very little variation of the HF velocity with a was\nobserved. Following earlier studies by Kohl et al. [1992] at\nVHF, by Moorcroft [1996] at UHF, and by Uspensky et al.\n[2001] at HF that suggested that the ion drift velocity\ncontribution to the E region irregularity velocity should be\nconsidered, Makarevitch et al. [2002] interpreted this ob-\nservation as being consistent with the linear theory formula\nin the reference frame of neutrals at the largest flow angles,\nq ffi 90\u0001, where Ve0C ffi 0 and phase velocity Vph ffi Vi0C is\nindependent of a. More evidence on the importance of the\nion motions at large flow angles has been presented at VHF\n[Uspensky et al., 2003, 2004; Makarevich et al., 2006a], at\nHF [Makarevitch et al., 2004] and at small flow angles and\nlarge aspect angles at HF [Milan et al., 2004].\n[8] In the recent study by Makarevich et al. [2006b] the\naspect angle dependence of the E region irregularity veloc-\nity measured by the Scandinavian Twin Auroral Radar\nExperiment (STARE) Norway VHF radar has been studied\nusing the coincident data on the electron drift velocity\nprovided by the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT)\nUHF radar. Using the unique experimental opportunity\nprovided by the special experiment design employed, it\nwas possible to decouple the aspect angle effects from those\nof the flow angle. It was found that at intermediate flow\nangles q = 50\u0001\u201370\u0001, that were most likely near the flow\nangle cone boundary q ffi q0, the velocity decrease was\nconsistent with the linear theory prediction without assum-\ning anomalous collision frequencies. This result implies that\nthe velocity decrease rate either is larger than previously\nthought [e.g., Ogawa et al., 1980; Nielsen, 1986] and\/or is\nan increasing function of the flow angle in agreement with\nthe theory of Sudan [1983]. Makarevich et al. [2006b] have\nalso noted that the results of Makarevitch et al. [2002]\nshowing the opposite effect for small velocities observed at\nlarge flow angles may have been affected by the ion\nmotions (see also our section 3.2).\n[9] The aim of this study is to investigate the aspect angle\ndependence of the E region velocity at large flow angles,\noutside the FBI flow angle cone. We employ the data from\nthe special experiments conducted in December 2004 using\nthe STARE Norway coherent VHF radar and the EISCAT\ntristatic facility (a subset of these data was used by\nMakarevich et al. [2006b]. The specific objectives are\n(1) to determine whether the E region irregularity velocity\nexhibits a decrease with the aspect angle at large flow\nangles q > q0 and in particular close to q = 90\u0001 using\nmeasurements at several locations with different aspect\nFigure 1.

Observations\n2.1. Experiment Setup\n[10] Figure 2 shows the experimental setup employed in\nthis study. Figure 2a is a geographic map view and Figure 2b\nis a three-dimensional schematic view from the west. The\nE region Doppler velocity data employed in this study have\nbeen collected by the STARE Norway VHF radar at Mid-\ntsandan (63.67\u0001N, 10.73\u0001E; 140 MHz). The 28.8\u0001-wide\nradar\u2019s field-of-view (FoV) is shown by the light grey\nsector. The data were collected for 8 radar beams (from 1\nto 8) separated by 3.6\u0001 in azimuth, with the bore site\ndirection at 26.2\u0001E. The nominal beam directions are shown\nby the dotted straight lines in Figure 2a.\n[11] The STARE radar used the information from the first\ntwo lags of the auto correlation function (ACF) to determine\nthe Doppler l-o-s velocity and backscatter power of the\nE region echoes at \u0001110 km [Greenwald et al., 1978;\nNielsen, 1982; Uspensky et al., 2005]. By convention, the\nDoppler velocity is positive (negative) for echoes approach-\ning (receding from) the radar site. The schematic view of\nFigure 2b shows the magnetic field line B, the field-\nperpendicular planes at 250 and 110 km, and a STARE\nbeam intersecting the magnetic field line at 110 km, with the\npositive l-o-s velocity Vlos measured. The integration time\nwas 20 s. In terms of range, the STARE measurements were\nperformed from 495 to 1245 km with 15-km resolution.\nDuring the data postprocessing, echoes with low power\n(SNR < 3 dB) were excluded from further analysis.\n[12] The electron drift velocity has been derived from the\nEISCAT radar measurements of the ion velocity in the F\nregion. The EISCAT UHF tristatic radar facility consists of\nthree parabolic dish antennas with one site in Troms\u00f8\ncombining both transmitting and receiving capabilities\nand two remote site receivers at Kiruna and Sodankyla\u00a8\n[Rishbeth and Williams, 1985]. The locations of the three\nradar sites are shown by the diamonds in Figure 2a. The\nEISCAT radar measures incoherent scatter ion-line spec-\ntrum, from which electron density, ion l-o-s velocity, ion\ntemperature, and electron\/ion temperature ratio can be com-\nputed. Tristatic velocity is obtained from the three l-o-s\ncomponents using the method outlined in the work of\nRishbeth and Williams [1985].\n[13] Figure 2 shows schematically EISCAT tristatic mea-\nsurements of the ion drift velocity in both the E and\nF regions. The three solid (dashed) lines originating from\nthe radar sites are the EISCAT beams intersecting at the\nF region height of 250 km (E region height of 110 km). Both\ntristatic volumes are located on the same magnetic field line\nshown by the inclined arrow in Figure 2b and short straight\nline in Figure 2a beginning (ending) on the closed (open)\ncircle. The ion drift velocity vectors measured by EISCAT at\n250 and 110 km are shown by the arrows in the respective\nFigure 2.

Figure 2a shows the field of view of\nthe Scandinavian Twin Auroral Radar Experiment (STARE) Norway radar by the light grey sector with\nthe nominal radar beam directions indicated by the dotted straight lines. The heavy curves represent the\nrectilinear aspect angle lines at 110 km, a = \u00050.5\u0001, and a = \u00052\u0001. The diamonds are the locations of the\nEuropean Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) radar sites, and the solid (dashed) lines are the EISCAT radar\nbeams intersecting at a particular location at 250 km (110 km). The closed (open) circles show all\nlocations of the EISCAT tristatic volume at 250 km (110 km) that were located on the same field lines as\nthe selected STARE radar cells along beam 2. The digits nearby indicate the aspect angle a for these\ncells. Figure 2b is a three-dimensional view from the west. A magnetic field line B is shown by the\ninclined downward arrow. The field-perpendicular planes intersecting B at 250 and 110 km are shown by\nthe rectangles. Also shown are the vector of the E region ion (electron) drift velocity Vi0 (Ve0) measured\nby EISCAT at 110 km (inferred from the F region EISCAT measurements of Vi0 at 250 km, Vi0\n250 ffi\nVe0\n250 ffi Ve0110), and the line-of-sight E region velocity, Vlos.\nA11303 MAKAREVICH ET AL.: ASPECT ANGLE DEPENDENCE OF VHF VELOCITY\n3 of 10\nA11303\nfield-perpendicular planes in Figure 2b. Since the back-\nground electric field (and hence the electron drift velocity\nVe0) is approximately the same along B, and since Vi0 ffi Ve0\nin the F region, the ion drift velocity in the F region at\n250 km is a good proxy for the electron drift in the E region\nat 110 km, Vi0\nF ffi Ve0E . To compute l-o-s components, the\ntristatic velocity vectors are first projected onto the field-\nperpendicular plane (these vectors are shown in Figure 2b)\nand then resolved along the beam direction.\n[14] In this study, we consider the data collected on 9\u201312\nDecember 2004 (at 1600\u20131800, 1500\u20131600, 1500\u20131600,\nand 1300\u20131600 UT, respectively; MLT ffi UT+2) in a\nspecial campaign during which EISCAT operated in a\nscanning mode designed to derive the E region electron\ndrift velocity at 7 points located along the STARE Norway\nbeam 2 (azimuth 17.2\u0001E). The EISCAT tristatic volume was\nlocated at 250 km (black dots in Figure 2a) and, when\nprojected along the magnetic field lines down to the height\nof 110 km, was successively coincident with the STARE\nrange cells shown by the open circles in Figure 2a\ncorresponding to rectilinear (geometrical) aspect angles\nshown by the digits near the open circles. These angles\nwere calculated using the IGRF magnetic field model and\nassuming straight-line propagation from the STARE radar\nsite to the center of the radar cell at 110 km. Makarevich et\nal. [2006b] used slightly different nominal values for aspect\nangles as the southeastern corner instead of the center of\neach radar cell was considered. The interpolated locations\nwith aspect angles of a = \u00050.5\u0001 and a = \u00052\u0001 in the STARE\nFoV are shown by the heavy curves in Figure 2a.\n[15] The duration of each scan was 30 min with the\nexception of 9 December 2004 when EISCAT also per-\nformed the tristatic ion drift measurements at 110 km with\nthe total scan time of 60 min. In this combined E\/F region\nmode both the electron and ion drift velocities were derived\nas shown in Figure 2b, with the ion drift velocity measured\ndirectly and the electron drift velocity inferred from projec-\nting Vi0\nF down to 110 km. Altogether, 12 scans have been\nperformed, with the coincident STARE echoes observed\nduring 8 scans. Both the EISCAT and STARE data were\npostintegrated over the EISCAT dwell time at each scan\nposition (\u0001230 s).\n2.2. Overview\n[16] Figure 3 presents a summary of the EISCAT mea-\nsurements of the electron drift velocity, Ve0. It shows the\nhistograms of the number of EISCAT observations with\ncoincident STARE echoes versus (Figure 3a) the electron\ndrift speed, Ve0, (Figure 3b) the flow angle q, (Figure 3c)\nthe electron drift velocity component resolved along the\nSTARE Norway beam 2 (azimuth 17.2\u0001E), Ve0\nC = Ve0 cos q,\nand (Figure 3d) the aspect angle a in the centers of the\nSTARE Norway radar cells located on the same magnetic\nfield lines as the EISCAT tristatic volumes. A small number\nof observations (3 points) gave values outside the x axis\nranges. These had values Ve0 = 2060 m\/s, q = 121\u0001, and Ve0\nC =\n\u0005699, 1120 m\/s, in Figures 3a, 3b, and 3c, respectively. The\nbin width in Figure 3d was chosen to be small as geomet-\nrical aspect angles were exactly the same for the same\nscanning positions of EISCAT, Figure 2a. In this study, the\nvector from the radar cell to the radar site gives the positive\ndirection, i.e., the vector components are positive (negative)\nwhen they are oriented toward (away from) the radar.\n[17] The electron drift speed was above 400 m\/s, in all but\none case (in which case it was 350 m\/s), in agreement with\nthe well-known threshold value for the drift speed needed to\nexcite the FB meter waves [e.g., Haldoupis et al. 1990].\nMore than half of the observations were under strongly\ndriven conditions with Ve0 in excess of 800 m\/s. The typical\nflow angles, Figure 3b, were in the range 55\u0001\u201390\u0001, i.e., at\nleast some observations were outside the flow angle cone\n(q > q0 \u0001 65\u0001). Figure 3c shows a similar picture: the\nelectron drift velocity component was between 0 and\n800 m\/s, meaning that some echoes observed were the\nprimary, inside-cone waves for which Ve0\nC > Cs and some\nwere the secondary, outside-cone waves with Ve0\nC < Cs. A\nminimum in the number of echoes at Ve0\nC = 300\u2013400 m\/s,\nalthough statistically insignificant, is close to the nominal\nFB threshold drift speed. All aspect angles, Figure 3d, are\nwell represented with at least 6 observations made for all\naspect angle values and with 7 observation for all but one\nvalue.\n2.3. Irregularity Velocity Versus Flow Angle\n[18] We now turn our attention to the STARE observa-\ntions of the E region irregularity velocity. It is well accepted\nthat it should vary with both the flow and aspect angles, and\nin Figures 4a and 4b we show the STARE velocity as a\nfunction of the flow angle q with the data points coded in\nthe aspect angle a as indicated in the top left corner of\nFigure 4b. Only points at large aspect angles are shown in\nFigure 4b. The points with small aspect angles, a < 1\u0001\ngenerally have larger velocities for q < 70\u0001, as expected.\nInterestingly, this trend is not so obvious at large flow\nangles, q > 70\u0001. The points with the largest aspect angles\n(squares) have small velocities (<300 m\/s), again in agree-\nFigure 3. The distributions of (a) the electron drift speed,\nVe0, (b) the flow angle q, (c) the electron drift velocity\ncomponent along the Norway radar beam 2, Ve0\nC = Ve0 cos q,\nand (d) the aspect angle a for all events considered.\nA11303 MAKAREVICH ET AL.: ASPECT ANGLE DEPENDENCE OF VHF VELOCITY\n4 of 10\nA11303\nment with the expected trend of the velocity decrease with\naspect angle. On the other hand, no clear decrease of\nvelocity with the flow angle is seen; velocities at large flow\nangles are only slightly smaller, and this may be due to\naspect angle effects as the aspect angles are generally larger\nhere (there are more points with large a at q > 70\u0001).\n[19] In addition to the flow and aspect angle effects, the\nirregularity velocity is expected to depend on the electron\ndrift speed, Ve0. As most of our data points are at large flow\nangles for which a simple proportionality is expected [e.g.,\nNielsen et al., 2002], one can normalize the irregularity\nvelocity to the electron speed, VN = Virr\/Ve0, and in\nFigures 4c and 4d we show this normalized velocity. The\nexpected cosine law curve, VN = cos q, is shown by the\ndashed line. The same (as in Figures 4a and 4b) general\ntrend is observed here, with the points at small a located at\nlarger velocities. These points are also close to the cosine\ncurve. The points at large a, on the other hand, are\nconsistently below (above) the cosine trend at small (large)\nflow angles. In Figure 4d we also show the trend VN = sinq\/4\n(dotted line) suggested by earlier studies by Milan et al.\n[2004] and Makarevich et al. [2006a] (see also our\nsection 3.1). One can notice from Figure 4d that the data\nat the largest aspect angle a = 2.63\u0001 highlighted by the solid\nlines exhibit a general increase with the flow angle and\nappear to be consistent with this trend.\n2.4. Irregularity Velocity Versus Aspect Angle\n[20] The VHF velocity is known to depend on both the\nflow and aspect angles. The aspect angle dependence is\nbelieved to be quite strong, i.e., velocity decreases quickly\nwith a [e.g., Nielsen, 1986]. One can expect therefore that\nvelocity will be mostly dependent on the aspect angle a if\nthe points from the same narrow range of q are selected.\n[21] Figure 5 shows the normalized velocity VN as a\nfunction of the aspect angle a for various flow angle ranges.\nThe digits near the points indicate the electron drift com-\nponent Ve0\nC in m\/s. To avoid overlapping of the data points\nwith the same nominal aspect angle, the points were shifted\nhorizontally by a small amount starting with the second\npoint within the same group. The solid lines show the phase\nvelocity variation with a as given by the linear theory of the\nFB instability with the collision frequencies taken from the\nMSISE-90 model run for the appropriate time and location\n(ne = 32500 s\n\u00051, ni = 765 s\n\u00051). This theoretical trend is\nprogressively smaller from Figures 5a to 5d as it includes\nthe cosine factor estimated for the center of the flow angle\ninterval (e.g., for q = 75\u0001 in Figure 5c).\n[22] The data at the smallest flow angles in Figure 5a\nhave the largest electron drift velocity components Ve0\nC and\nagree well with the theoretical prediction. The data in\nFigure 5b agree with the trend but only for the largest Ve0\nC .\nThe disagreement is the largest for points with smallest Ve0\nC .\nIn Figure 5c one can recognize a general decrease but the\npoints are consistently above the theoretical curve. In\nFigure 5d all points have Ve0\nC < 200 m\/s and lie above the\nsolid line; no clear trend is observed here. One can conclude\nthat the aspect angle dependence of the phase velocity\nappears to be different at various flow angles. It is consistent\nwith the linear theory at small flow angles q < 60\u0001, exhibits\nFigure 4.

The data\npoints are coded in aspect angle a according to the scheme in\nthe top left corner of Figure 4b. The dashed line in Figures 4c\nand 4d is the curve VN = cos q, and the dotted line in\nFigure 4d is the curve VN = sin q\/4.\nFigure 5. The normalized velocity VN versus the aspect\nangle a for different flow angles q as indicated in the top\nright corner. The digits near the points indicate the electron\ndrift velocity component along the STARE beam, Ve0\nC. The\nphase velocity variation with a given by the linear fluid\ntheory with model collision frequency is shown by the solid\nline in each panel.\nA11303 MAKAREVICH ET AL.: ASPECT ANGLE DEPENDENCE OF VHF VELOCITY\n5 of 10\nA11303\nsome decrease with a while being larger than the linear\ntheory prediction at q = 65\u0001\u201380\u0001, and independent of a at\nthe largest flow angles q > 80\u0001. The aspect angle decrease\nrate of the VHF velocity also appears to be decreasing with\nthe flow angle.\n2.5. Irregularity Velocity and Electron and Ion Drifts\n[23] In the previous two sections we normalized the\nirregularity velocity to the electron drift speed Ve0 bearing\nin mind that at large flow angles the VHF velocity is\nbelieved to be proportional to Ve0 [e.g., Moorcroft, 2002].\nAnalysis of the data from the combined E\/F region scan of\nEISCAT also provides an opportunity to investigate the\nrelation between the E region irregularity velocity and the\nion drift velocity component, similar to the recent study by\nMakarevich et al. [2006a] that demonstrated that at the\nlargest flow angles the E region velocity may be represen-\ntative of the ion drift component (rather than of that of the\nelectrons).\n[24] Figure 6 shows an example of the electron and ion\ndrift velocity measurements by EISCAT. Figure 6a shows\nthe magnitudes and Figure 6b shows the directions (in\ngeographic azimuth, East of geographic North). The elec-\ntron-to-ion-speed ratio and the difference between azimuths\nare shown by the dashed lines in Figures 6a and 6b,\nrespectively. The typical speed ratio was about 4 and the\ndifference between directions was 70\u0001\u201390\u0001, i.e., the ion\ndrift vector was about 4 times smaller in length and rotated\nclockwise from the electron drift direction. By resolving the\nelectron and ion drift vectors along the STARE Norway\nbeam 2 direction one can derive the electron and ion drift\ncomponents to compare with the l-o-s E region irregularity\nvelocity measured by STARE (we have already used the\nresolved electron drift velocity component in Figure 5).\n[25] Figure 7 shows the E region irregularity velocity\nmeasured by STARE on 9 December 2004 versus the\nresolved (Figure 7a) electron and (Figure 7b) ion velocity\ncomponents. Figures 7c and 7d present similar comparisons\nfor the entire data set. The ion drift components in Figure 7d\nwere calculated from the EISCAT-derived electron drift\nvelocity assuming that the ion drift velocity vector is 4\ntimes smaller in length (Vi0 = Ve0\/4) and rotated by 90\u0001\nclockwise (Azi0 = Aze0 \u0005 90\u0001) in rough agreement with\nFigure 6. The ion drift velocity component in Figure 7 was\nreversed as indicated by the minus sign in the x axis label.\n[26] For the data recorded on 9 December 2004, only the\nirregularity velocity at smaller aspect angles (a \u0006 1.12\u0001) is\nclose to the electron drift component in Figure 7a. At large\naspect angles, the velocity is significantly depressed owing\nto the aspect angle effects with the depression increasing\nwith the aspect angle, as expected. Interestingly enough, the\nirregularity velocity is close to the negative of the ion drift\ncomponent at large aspect angles, Figure 7b. For the entire\ndata set in Figure 7c, velocity is larger (smaller) than Ve0\nC\nwhen Ve0\nC is smaller (larger) than \u0001400 m\/s at small aspect\nangles. The linear Pearson correlation coefficient [Wilks,\n1995] for all points in Figure 7c is only 0.11; it is\nsignificantly larger for points with small aspect angles,\n0.67. At large aspect angles, no clear trend is observed.\nThe correlation coefficient for points with large aspect\nangles in Figure 7c is negative and increasing in magnitude\nwith an increase in the lowest aspect angle considered; it is\n\u00050.26, \u00050.34, \u00050.42, and \u00050.80 for points with a \u0007 1.12\u0001,\n1.63\u0001, 1.98\u0001, and 2.63\u0001.

Discussion\n[27] In this study we present observations of the E region\nirregularity phase velocity measured by the STARE Norway\nVHF radar at several locations with different aspect angles\nfrom a = 0.48\u0001 to 2.63\u0001 in conjunction with simultaneous\nand coincident data on the electron and, for one event, ion\ndrift velocity component provided by the EISCAT tristatic\nfacility. The relationship between the E region irregularity\nand electron drift velocities has been extensively studied in\nthe past including the STARE and EISCAT velocity com-\nparisons similar to that employed in the present study\n[Nielsen and Schlegel, 1983, 1985; Kofman and Nielsen,\n1990; Kustov and Haldoupis, 1992; Nielsen et al., 2002;\nKoustov et al., 2002; Uspensky et al., 2003, 2004, 2006].\nAll of the above studies, however, have used observations\nfrom the CP-1 common mode of EISCAT. In this mode,\nposition of tristatic volume is fixed and hence comparisons\nwith the STARE velocity are only possible in one radar cell\n(located on the same magnetic field line as tristatic volume)\nwith a fixed value of aspect angle of \u00011\u0001.\n[28] With respect to the aspect angle values, one has to\nbear in mind that in this study we used the nominal values\ncomputed as described in section 2.1 and that the real aspect\nangle values might have been different even at VHF\nfrequencies owing to the altitude integration effects. The\nestimates show that typical variation due to changes in the\nelectron density distribution at VHF is of the order of 0.1\u0001\n[Uspensky et al., 2003] and in the following we take this\nvalue for the uncertainty in the aspect angle.\n[29] We demonstrated in Figure 3a that all of our data\npoints refer to the strong electric field conditions with the\nFBI operational, Ve0 > 350 m\/s. The flow angles computed,\nFigure 3b, indicated that the irregularities were observed\nboth at small and large flow angles, inside and outside the\nFBI flow angle cone, respectively.\n[30] According to the linear fluid theory of the FBI\n[e.g., Fejer and Kelley, 1980] developed for small flow\nangles, q < q0, the irregularity phase velocity at a direction\nof wave propagation vector k^ \b k\/k is given by\nVph \u00bc k^ \n Vd\n1\u00fe Y \u00fe k^ \n Vi0 \u00bc\nVCd\n1\u00fe Y\u00fe V\nC\ni0 ; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere Vd is the differential plasma drift velocity Vd = Ve0 \u0005\nVi0 and the anisotropy factor Y [Sahr and Fejer, 1996] is a\nfunction of aspect angle a, collision frequencies of ions and\nelectrons with neutrals (ni, ne) and ion and electron gyro\nfrequencies (Wi, We):\nY \u00bc neni\nWeWi\ncos2 a \u00fe W\n2\ne\nn2e\nsin2 a\n\u0001 \u0002\n: \u00f02\u00de\n3.1. Irregularity Velocity at Small and Intermediate\nFlow Angles\n[31] At small flow and aspect angles, both the ion drift\nvelocity component Vi0\nC and the anisotropy factor Y are\nsmall and the phase velocity can be approximated as\nVph ffi V\nC\ne0\n1\u00fe Y \u0001 V\nC\ne0: \u00f03\u00de\n[32] Experimental studies showed, however, that at small\nflow angles the irregularity velocity is significantly less than\nthe electron drift component [Nielsen and Schlegel, 1983,\n1985]. It has been proposed that the phase velocity is\nlimited by the ion-acoustic speed, Vph = Cs [Nielsen and\nSchlegel, 1983] owing to the nonlinear processes [e.g.,\nSudan, 1983]. Since the ion-acoustic speed itself is an\nincreasing function of the electron drift speed Ve0, the phase\nvelocity depends indirectly on the electron drift Ve0 [Nielsen\nand Schlegel, 1985]. Later Nielsen et al. [2002] has derived\nan empirical formula for the phase velocity Vph = Cs (cos q\/\ncos 40\u0001)g, where the coefficient g is a decreasing function of\nthe electron drift speed. Bahcivan et al. [2005] have recently\nsuggested that the phase velocity is simply a l-o-s compo-\nnent of the ion-acoustic speed, Vph = Cs cos q. All of these\napproaches imply that the velocity should be either a\nconstant (Cs) or a decreasing function of the flow angle.\n[33] The phase velocity has also been shown to be a\ndecreasing function of the aspect angle at small flow angles\nbut the rate of decrease was slower than that given by\nequations (1) and (2). The velocity attenuation rate was\nfound to be consistent with equation (1) with the substitu-\ntion of ne in equation (2) by an enhanced value of n* = 6ne\nand interpreted as being due to \u2018\u2018anomalous\u2019\u2019 wave-particle\ncollisions [Ogawa et al., 1980; Nielsen, 1986].\n[34] In our observations at small aspect angles the phase\nvelocity did exhibit a decrease with the flow angle which\nwas roughly consistent with the cosine law curve, Figure 4c.\nAt large aspect angles, a general VHF velocity increase was\nseen instead. The VHF velocity increase with the flow angle\nis unexpected and appears to be inconsistent with the\nprevious VHF studies that reported a cosine-type decrease\n[e.g., Greenwald et al., 1978; Nielsen et al., 2002]. How-\never, this result is consistent with the velocity increase with\nthe flow angle at large aspect angles reported by\nMakarevitch et al. [2002] and Milan et al. [2004] at HF.\nMilan et al. [2004] proposed that at large aspect angles, the\nanisotropy factor Y in equation (1) becomes very large and\nthe phase velocity is to the first approximation proportional\nto the sine (ion drift velocity) component, with the coeffi-\ncient dependent on the altitude and for their observations\nselected as 1\/10. Later Makarevich et al. [2006a] showed\nthat at 110 km, the ion-to-electron-speed ratio is about 1\/4\nand in Figure 4d the flow angle variation at the largest\naspect angle (solid lines) was consistent with this trend.\n[35] At the smallest flow angles available, q < 60\u0001, the\nirregularity velocity exhibited a decrease with the aspect\nangle which was consistent with the trend given by\nequation (1), Figure 5a, without any enhancement in the\ncollision frequencies. This result is similar to that of the\nearlier analysis by Makarevich et al. [2006b] who consid-\nered the irregularity velocity normalized to the electron drift\nA11303 MAKAREVICH ET AL.: ASPECT ANGLE DEPENDENCE OF VHF VELOCITY\n7 of 10\nA11303\nvelocity component Ve0\nC and introduced a restriction Ve0\nC >\n500 m\/s. One can easily see that both analyses produce\nessentially the same result, as the points with Ve0\nC > 500 m\/s\nlie close to the linear theory curve in Figures 5a and 5b. One\nshould note, however, that this result is not inconsistent with\nthe theory of anomalous collisions as most data points at q <\n60\u0001 referred to the intermediate flow angles near the FBI\ncone boundary where no anomalous collisions are expected\n[Sudan, 1983].\n3.2. Irregularity Velocity at Large Flow Angles\n[36] Most of the data at large flow angles (q > 65\u0001) referred\nto the \u2018\u2018overspeed\u2019\u2019 case [Uspensky et al., 2003], i.e., the\nirregularity velocity was larger than the electron drift com-\nponent. This feature is inconsistent with the view that the\nirregularity velocity at large flow angles represents well the\nelectron drift velocity, equation (3) [Kofman and Nielsen,\n1990; Kustov and Haldoupis, 1992; Nielsen et al., 2002].\nThe other approach assumes that the irregularity velocity is\nrelated to the ion-acoustic speed Cs. Evidence has been\npresented that the irregularity velocity (1) is limited by the\nion-acoustic speed at small flow angles Vph = Cs [Nielsen\nand Schlegel, 1983, 1985], (2) is described well by the\nempirical formula Vph = Cs (cos q\/cos 40\u0001)\ng at small flow\nangles [Nielsen et al., 2002], and (3) is close to the l-o-s\ncomponent of the Cs, Vph ffi Cs cos q at any flow angle\n[Bahcivan et al., 2005]. One can therefore investigate the\nflow angle dependence of the irregularity velocity normal-\nized to Cs instead of Ve0 and determine whether this\ndependence is different at large aspect angles.\n[37] Figure 8 shows the STARE velocity normalized to Cs\nversus the flow angle in the same format as Figures 4c and\n4d. The ion-acoustic speed for all events was estimated from\nthe electron drift speed measurements by EISCAT at 250 km\nand an empirical formula similar to that of Nielsen and\nSchlegel [1985], viz. Cs = A + B Ve0\n2 . The coefficients A and\nB were estimated by considering an extensive data set of\nEISCAT observations (Cs at 111 km versus Ve0 = Vi0 at\n278 km) analogous to that in the work of Uspensky et al.\n[2006] and restricting it to the appropriate time sector\n(1200\u20131900 MLT). The best least squares fit coefficients\nwere derived as A = 380 m s\u00051, B = 0.000155 m\u00051 s.\n[38] At small aspect angles, the normalized velocity is\nconsistently above the dashed cosine curve implied by the\nmodel of Bahcivan et al. [2005], i.e., this model under-\nestimates the irregularity velocity, the result consistent with\nthat of Uspensky et al. [2006]. The empirical formula of\nNielsen et al. [2002] with parameter g = 0.4 chosen for\ntypical electron drift speeds of 1000 m\/s (Figure 3a), on the\nother hand, represents the data reasonably well. At large\naspect angles, the points are above the cosine trend for large\nflow angles and, moreover, no clear decrease or perhaps\neven some increase is observed, e.g., at the largest aspect\nangle of a = 2.63\u0001. Both models disagree with observations\nat large aspect angles, Figure 8b. Recalling that at large a a\nsignificant disagreement was also observed between the\nirregularity velocity and the electron drift component,\nFigure 4d, one can conclude that none of the models that\ntake into account the electron motions only explain reason-\nably well the flow angle dependence at large aspect angles.\n[39] Milan et al. [2004] and Makarevitch et al. [2004]\nargued that as the flow angle increases, the electron drift\ncomponent decreases as cos q whereas the ion drift compo-\nnent increases approximately as sin q so that one can expect\nthe ion drifts to dominate at the largest flow angles and affect\nboth the flow and aspect angle dependencies. Figure 4c\nshowed that all points at q > 75\u0001 are above the cosine law\ncurve irrespectively of the aspect angle. Similarly, Figure 5\nshowed that the points at large q and low Ve0\nC were consis-\ntently above the linear theory trend. Moreover, at the largest\nflow angles, q > 80\u0001, no decrease with the aspect angle was\nseen (Figure 5d). The latter observation is consistent with\nearlier observations by Makarevitch et al. [2002] at HF.\n[40] From Figures 5b\u20135d, it appears that the aspect angle\nattenuation rate at large flow angles is smaller than pre-\ndicted by the linear theory and that it decreases with the\nflow angle. It may be incorrect, however, to interpret the\nobserved experimental trends as being due to an increase in\nthe effective collision frequency with the flow angle (an\nopposite effect to that implied by Sudan [1983]) as dis-\ncussed below.\n[41] According to equation (1), the phase velocity is a\nfunction of both the electron and ion drift components. The\nrelative importance of the plasma species motions depends\non the flow angle and the anisotropy factor. The factor Y\nitself is a fast increasing function of the aspect angle and\npossibly an increasing function of the flow angle, indirectly\nthrough the anomalous collision frequency n*, equation (2)\n[Sudan, 1983]. To determine whether n* and Y depend\nindirectly on the flow angle, one needs to compare the\nfunction b \b (1 + Y)\u00051 for different flow angles. If the ion\ndrift velocity is not zero in equation (1), a simple normal-\nization to Ve0 or Ve0\nC would not yield the function b.

STARE velocity normalized to the ion-acoustic\nspeed Cs versus the flow angle q for small (a) and large (b)\naspect angles. The dashed line is the cosine law curve and\nthe dash-dotted line is the trend given by the empirical\nformula of Nielsen et al. [2002].\nA11303 MAKAREVICH ET AL.: ASPECT ANGLE DEPENDENCE OF VHF VELOCITY\n8 of 10\nA11303\n9 December 2004 and using measured Ve0\nC and model \u00b1Vi0\nC\nfor the entire data set) showed any distinct features.\n[42] The other limit of equation (1) is at the largest flow\nangles and\/or at large aspect angles, where Y \u000e 1. In this\ncase, the phase velocity should be representative of the ion\ndrift velocity component:\nVph \u00bc V\nC\nd\n1\u00fe Y\u00fe V\nC\ni0 ffi VCi0 : \u00f05\u00de\n[43] This expectation was investigated by Makarevich\net al. [2006a] who compared the STARE Finland velocity\nand the ion drift component Vi0\nC measured by EISCAT in the\nE region and found that the phase velocity was generally\nbetween the ion velocity components at 110 and 115 km. In\nthat study, however, the aspect angles were of the order of\n1\u0001 and the correlation between the irregularity and ion drift\nvelocity was of the order of 0.6. In this study the aspect\nangles were up to 2.63\u0001 and given a fast increase of Y with\na, equation (2), one would expect the correlation to be more\nsignificant and less affected by the flow angle effects.\n[44] Indeed, Figure 7 showed that the agreement between\nthe irregularity and electron drift velocity was poor, in\nparticular at large aspect angles a, whereas the agreement\nbetween the irregularity and ion drift velocity at large a was\nquite reasonable both for the measured and model ion drift\nvelocity components. The correlation in Figure 7d was\npositive and increasing with the aspect angle reaching 0.8\nat a = 2.63\u0001. The major difference between results of\nMakarevich et al. [2006a] and this study is that the ion\ndrift component plotted in Figure 7 was reversed. In other\nwords, the observed irregularity velocity at large a agreed\nwell with the ion drift component in magnitude but was\nopposite in polarity.\n[45] Interestingly, a similar result was reported by Kohl et\nal. [1992] who employed STARE and EISCAT data and\nused an equation analogous to equation (1) while assuming\nthat the phase velocity is saturated at Cs to infer the\nnumerical values for Y and Vi0. Kohl et al. [1992] conclud-\ned that equation (1) implies that the ions stream against the\nobserved wave. Our analysis showed that for the phase\nvelocity to be described well by equation (1) at large a the\nsign of the ion drift component should be reversed. One\nshould note that all velocity polarities were consistent with\nthose expected for this time of the day; the electron (ion)\ndrifts were westward (poleward) and consistent with the\nwestward plasma flow (poleward electric field) in the\nafternoon sector. The STARE Norway irregularity l-o-s\nvelocity was positive (toward the radar), which is consistent\nwith the electron drift component sign and numerous\nprevious studies [e.g., Kohl et al., 1992; Koustov et al.,\n2002; Uspensky et al., 2004]. Both Kohl et al. [1992] and\nKoustov et al. [2002] have also noted that their results might\nhave been affected by the finite neutral winds at altitudes of\n100\u2013110 km. However, the neutral wind magnitudes in the\naltitude range of interest are not expected to be considerably\nlarger than 100 m\/s [e.g., Nozawa and Brekke, 1995],\nwhereas the ion drift components in our observations were\n100\u2013400 m\/s and consistently close to the VHF velocity,\nFigure 7d. Clearly, this is an unexpected result, and the one\nthat eludes explanation given our present understanding of\nthe theory of electrojet irregularities.\n[46] It should be emphasized though that the fact that at\nlarger flow angles the E region velocity (normalized to the\nelectron drift speed\/electric field) in Figure 5 exhibits a\ndecrease with the aspect angle which is slower than that\ngiven by the linear theory and decreasing with the flow\nangle, does not necessarily mean that an increase with the\nflow angle occurs in the effective frequency n*, as normal-\nization to Ve0 or Ve0\nC may not fully account for the direct\neffects of the flow angle since the irregularity velocity can\nbe affected by the ion motions as well.\n4. Summary\n[47] The E region irregularity velocity measured by the\nSTARE Norway VHF radar at flow angles q = 55\u0001\u201390\u0001 was\nconsidered at 7 locations with aspect angles a between\n0.48\u0001 and 2.63\u0001. The EISCAT tristatic system operated in a\nspecial scanning mode providing simultaneous and coinci-\ndent data on the electron and (for one event) ion drift\nvelocities in the E region. The observations showed that\n[48] 1. At large aspect angles a > 1\u0001, the E region\nvelocity variation with the flow angle was not consistent\nwith the expected cosine variation and, moreover, it\nexhibited no decrease with the flow angle. At the largest\naspect angle a = 2.63\u0001, the flow angle dependence was\napproximated by the sine of the flow angle multiplied by\none quarter of the electron drift speed.\n[49] 2. The aspect angle variation at the flow angles q <\n70\u0001 and electron drift components exceeding 500 m\/s was\nfound to be consistent with the prediction of the linear fluid\ntheory without any enhancement in the electron collision\nfrequency. At larger flow angles\/smaller electron drift\ncomponents, the velocity decrease rate was smaller than\nthat given by the linear theory and decreasing with the flow\nangle so that at the largest flow angles q > 80\u0001 no velocity\ndecrease with the aspect angle was seen.\n[50] 3. The E region irregularity velocity at small aspect\nangles a < 1\u0001 was correlated reasonably well with the\nelectron drift velocity component. At large aspect angles\na > 1\u0001, an anticorrelation was observed instead, with the\ncorrelation coefficient magnitude increasing with the aspect\nangle. At a > 1\u0001, a substantial positive correlation was\nobserved between the E region velocity and the negative of\nthe ion drift component with the correlation coefficient\nincreasing with the aspect angle.\n[51] 4. It was argued that the E region velocity observa-\ntions at large flow and\/or aspect angles were likely to be\naffected by the ion motions and that without taking into\naccount these effects it is impossible to conclude on the\nimplications of the observed trends in the velocity aspect\nangle decrease rates (point 2) for the theory of anomalous\ncollisions.\n5. Conclusion\n[52] The E region irregularity phase velocity at large\nflow angles exhibits a decrease with the aspect angle. The\nrate of decrease is consistent with the prediction of the\nlinear fluid theory of electrojet irregularities at the inter-\nmediate flow angles near the instability flow angle cone\nboundary. At larger flow angles, outside the flow angle\ncone, the velocity attenuation rate appears to be decreas-\nA11303 MAKAREVICH ET AL.: ASPECT ANGLE DEPENDENCE OF VHF VELOCITY\n9 of 10\nA11303\ning with the flow angle so that at the largest flow angles,\nvelocity is largely independent of the aspect angle. At\nlarge aspect angles, the E region phase velocity is close\nto the ion drift velocity component in terms of magnitude\nbut opposite in polarity. The observed trends in the\nvelocity decrease rate at large flow angles appear to be\ninconsistent with the anomalous collisions theory. How-\never, the ion motion effects should be taken into account\nin order to study the anomalous collision frequency as a\nfunction of the flow angle in more detail.\n[53] Acknowledgments.
