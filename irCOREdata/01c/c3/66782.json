Yet this pattern of sustained breast-feeding is uncommon in \nindustrialised countries like the UK (Foster et al, 1995). Successful milk feeding, whether 5 \nbreast or bottle, is critical in the early weeks of life when infants are in their most rapid \nphase of growth.  A large body of literature discusses what advice should be given to \npromote healthy feeding habits (Mozingo et al, 2000; Health Education Authority, 1998) \nand discusses the impact of breast vs. bottle feeding on early growth (Dewey et al, 1992; \nNelson et al, 1989).  However, very little documentation exists to show what patterns of 10 \nfeeding new mother-infant pairs actually adopt, or how these patterns in turn relate to the \ncontinuation of breast-feeding and weight gain. \nDetailed feeding data may be obtained from observational studies such as sucking \ntechnique evaluations (Righard, 1998), videotaping feeds (Wright et al, 1980), and \nmeasuring milk consumption by weighing the infant before and after a feed (Wright, 15 \n1981, 1986; Hillervik-Lindquist et al, 1991).  Unfortunately, such studies involve \ncumbersome processes, which interrupt normal regimes and rarely supply enough \nsubjects to explore covariance within the cohort.  Experimental work has shed important \nlight on critical influences on feeding (Salariya et al, 1978) but is not informative about \nwhat happens in \u201cfree living\u201d infants. 20 \nAs part of a large longitudinal study of feeding and growth, mothers were asked to \nkeep a feeding diary, recording the pattern of milk feeding during the first week of life in \norder to: \nEarly infant feeding patterns 5\n1. Describe the first-week feeding patterns and how they vary for breast and bottle fed \ninfants. \n2. Test whether any aspect of the feeding patterns (interval between feeds or duration of \nfeeding, or bottle supplementation) or maternal characteristics was related to the \ncontinuance of breast-feeding. 5 \n3. Test whether any aspect of the first-week feeding patterns (breast- vs. bottle-feeding, \ninterval between feeds, duration, amount per feed, and rate of feeding (ml\/min)) or \nmaternal characteristics was related to infant weight gain over the first six weeks. \nEarly infant feeding patterns 6\nMETHODS \nStudy population \nThe Millennium Baby Study recruited mothers in a deprived, urban, northeastern \nUK community shortly after the birth of their infant (usually in hospital on the 1st or 2nd \nday following delivery)  to study patterns of feeding and growth in early life.  All babies 5 \nborn to residents of the study community in pre-set recruiting weeks were eligible for the \nstudy.  For this analysis we excluded 68 preterm infants (gestation less than 37 weeks), \n38 infants from religious minorities with very different feeding norms from the majority \npopulation and 141 whose diaries did not cover the requisite time period, leaving 502 \ndiaries for analysis.   Ethical approval was obtained from the Local Research Ethics 10 \nCommittee.   \nThe mothers who agreed to join the study completed a recruitment questionnaire, \nwhich included socio-demographic data.  They were issued with a personal child health \nrecord, which included weight-recording forms to be completed by health professionals \nand a feeding diary which they were asked to complete for three days after recruitment 15 \nand within the child's first week of life.  The diary included columns for the date and time \nof each feed, type of feed (e.g., breast or formula), length of feed and (for bottle feeds) \nvolume of feed.  Diaries were collected by the mothers\u2019 midwives at a routine screening \nvisit and sent back to the project office.   \nBecause mothers only reported feeds during the period of diary recording, we 20 \nhave no information on whether formula, water, or breast-milk may have been given  \nbefore the recording period, but it was hospital ward policy then as now not to offer \nsupplementary feeds to breast-fed infants.  Rooming-in was the normal ward practice for \nEarly infant feeding patterns 7\nboth breast- and bottle-fed infants, although this information was not specifically \nrecorded in the diaries either. \nInfant weight data collected at the first health-visitor* check at around 12 days \nwere also sent to the project office.  All weights were measured using standard scales in \nclinical use.  At six weeks, parents were sent the first of a series of self completion 5 \nquestionnaires on which they reported current infant milk feeding status as \u2018breast\u2019, \n\u2018bottle\u2019 or \u2018both\u2019 and transcribed weights from the infant\u2019s routine medical check at 6 \nweeks of age.  At the end of the study (13 months), a duplicate of the weight data from \nthe child health record was also retrieved and used for cross-checking. \nAnalyses 10 \nThree feeding groups were identified from records in the diaries: exclusively breast \nfed (BREAST), exclusively bottle fed (BOTTLE) and both breast and bottle fed \n(MIXED).  For each infant the date and time at the start and end of the diary was entered \nand the number of feeds recorded, from which the feed-to-feed interval (defined as the \naverage time from the start of one feed to the start of the next feed) was calculated as a 15 \nmeasure of feeding frequency, by dividing the amount of time covered by the diary by the \nnumber of inter-feed intervals.  Feed duration (minutes) and, for bottle-feeders, amount \n(ml) were also recorded for each feed, from which the feeding rate (ml\/min) per feed was \ncalculated.  In order to characterize feeding schedule, these variables were averaged over \nthe diary for each mother-infant pair.  In addition, they were computed for the first 5 20 \n                                                 \n* a public-health nurse with statutory responsibility for pre-school children \nEarly infant feeding patterns 8\nfeeds only, describing feeding patterns on the starting day of the diary.  One feed was \ndefined as one entry in the diary.  \nOutcomes studied at the time the diaries were completed were group differences in \nthe feeding frequencies and feed duration of BREAST, BOTTLE, and MIXED feeders,  \nexplored by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with least-significant-difference (LSD) post-5 \nhoc tests, or Kruskal-Wallis tests.  The covariance of factors related to feed-to-feed \ninterval and weight gain were determined by stepwise linear regression.    \nOutcomes assessed at 6 weeks were feeding mode and weight gain.  These were \nrelated to feeding mode and to feeding characteristics at the time of the diary using \nANOVA . 10 \nSocio-demographic predictors of breast feeding at the time of the dairy and at 6 \nweeks were also assessed using  logistic regression (using the Statistical Package for \nSocial Scientists SPSS, version 10.0).  Infant sex and age, in days, at the start of the diary, \nmaternal age and education, gestation, parity and deprivation were included in all \nregressions to control for these variables. 15 \nLevels of social economic deprivation were assessed by two methods.  At \nrecruitment, demographic information was collected and used to dichotomise families \ninto affluent (homeowner, car owner and one or more employed parent) and deprived \n(one or more of: rented housing, no car or no employed parent), for use in logistic \nregressions.  In addition, the child\u2019s postcode at birth was used to identify their census 20 \nenumeration district and the Townsend score (a summary measure using 1991 census \ndata, Townsend et al, 1988) for that enumeration district was recorded.  These scores \nwere then divided into 5 categories corresponding to the quintiles for the Northern region, \nEarly infant feeding patterns 9\nto provide a finer grained classification for linear regressions.  Maternal educational \ninformation was also collected; for analysis in logistic regression this was dichotomised \ninto those with and without education beyond the age of 16 years.  Variables with skewed \ndistributions (feed duration, feeding rate (ml\/min) and amount of feed (ml)) were log \ntransformed for parametric analyses.   5 \nMeasures of Weight Gain \nOnce data collection was completed all weights available for each infant were \ncollated and duplicates deleted.  Weights were converted to SD scores compared to the \nUK 1990 growth reference (Freeman et al, 1995).  All extreme SD scores were checked \nagainst other weights held on the infant, corrected where possible, or deleted if plainly 10 \nerroneous (e.g. where one value was inconsistent with other weights for that infant \naround the same age).  For each infant the weights nearest to the two target ages (12 days, \n6 weeks) and within a pre-stated range (9-21, 30-69 days, respectively) were identified.  \nWeight gain was measured using the Thrive Index, which is a measure of change in \nweight conditional on the baseline (Wright et al, 1994).  The Thrive Index was calculated 15 \nas follows: \n TI = SDStime2 - r*SDStime1  \nr being the regression coefficient for the whole survey population for that time interval. \nThe TI equations used in this study were: \n 12 day TI = 12 day SDS - (0.866 * birth weight SDS)  20 \n 6 week TI = 6 week SDS - (0.65 * birth weight SDS) \nEarly infant feeding patterns 10\nRESULTS \n1254 babies were born in the 34 recruiting weeks.  The mothers of 1029 (82%) \nbabies agreed to join the study, of whom 68 pre-term, 33 (3%) Ultra orthodox Jewish, \nand 5 (0.5%) Muslim infants were excluded, leaving 923 participants.  Of these, 643 \n(70%) returned diaries. 47 diaries were excluded where mothers began recording after the 5 \ninfant was over a week old.  19 were completed continuously for less than 12 hours, 48 \nfor 12-24 hours and 27 for longer than 78 hours.  Only diaries covering periods of more \nthan 24 hours contained enough feeds to be useful, while diaries kept for longer than 78 \nhours were insufficiently detailed.  This meant that 502 diaries were used for this \nanalysis, from 54% of the cohort.  Mothers returning diaries were less deprived and more 10 \nlikely to breast-feed, but were otherwise similar to the cohort as a whole in their socio-\ndemographic characteristics (Table 1).  Mean diary length was 49.6 (SD 12.7) hours.  \n45% of the diaries commenced on the first or second day of life. \nFirst-Week Feeding Characteristics \nDuring the period covered by the diary, 172 (34%) infants were exclusively 15 \nbreast-fed, 278 (56%) were bottle-fed, and 52 (10%) were mixed-fed (Table 2).  The \nMIXED group showed wide variation with respect to the proportion of feeds represented \nby breast-feeds (median=50%, interquartile range 22.9% \u2013 78.8%). BREAST infants \nwere fed more frequently than the BOTTLE and MIXED groups (p<0.001), but there was \nno significant difference between the BOTTLE and MIXED groups in feed-to-feed 20 \ninterval.  Feed duration did not differ significantly between the three groups or by infant \nage. \nEarly infant feeding patterns 11\nBottle- or mixed-feeding (i.e., not BREAST) was associated in logistic regression \nwith deprivation (Odds ratio (OR) =3.380, p<0.001, 95% CI = 2.174 to 5.252) and \nnegatively associated with maternal education (OR=0.576, p=0.01, 95% CI = 0.378 to \n0.878, >16 years versus less).   None of the analysed variables were associated with feed-\nto-feed interval for BOTTLE or MIXED feeders, but for the BREAST group, the age in 5 \ndays of the first recorded feed (\u03b2 (standardized) =-0.276, p<0.001) and mother\u2019s parity \n(\u03b2=0.150, p=0.046) were significant factors in multiple regression.  However, these \nfactors had no effect when diaries which began on the day of birth were excluded (N=98). \nAge was positively correlated with both volume consumed per feed (for \nBOTTLE) and feeding rate (ml\/min) for the first 5 recorded feeds (logged values, 10 \n\u03b2=0.548, p<0.001; \u03b2=0.252, p<0.001).  Feed duration was negatively correlated with rate \n(\u03b2=-1.055, p<0.001) and positively correlated with amount per feed (\u03b2=0.603, p<0.001). \nBreast-feeding Status at 6 Weeks \n48% of the BREAST infants were still exclusively breast-fed at 6 weeks and 68% \nwere still breast-fed at least in part (Table 3).  Only 30% of MIXED infants were still 15 \nbreast-fed at all at 6 weeks (Chi2 p<0.001), half of whom were now fully breast-feeding, \nand half still mixing breast and bottle feeding.  In this MIXED group, those who \ncontinued to breastfeed had significantly longer first-week feed duration than those who \nhad stopped breast-feeding at 6 weeks (Table 4).  Neither feed duration nor feed-to-feed \ninterval differed significantly among the six-week feeding groups for the initially 20 \nBREAST group.  \nMaternal education past age 16 (OR =  2.380, p=0.004, 95% CI = 1.313 to 4.315) \nand exclusively BREAST-feeding for the diary recording period (OR=4.672, p<0.001, \nEarly infant feeding patterns 12\n95% CI = 2.024 to 10.786) were associated with exclusive breast-feeding at 6 weeks.. \nFeed-to-feed interval was not significantly associated with breast-feeding continuation. \nWeight Gain Over the First 6 Weeks \nWeight gain (TI) was significantly lower for BREAST than for BOTTLE fed \ninfants at 12 days and 6 weeks (Table 5).  Among the BREAST group, mother-infant 5 \npairs with lower first-week feed-to-feed interval, lower parity, and boys had significantly \nhigher weight gain over the first 6 weeks (Table 6).  No variables were significantly \nassociated with weight gain for the BOTTLE or MIXED groups. \nEarly infant feeding patterns 13\nDISCUSSION  \nThis study generated three main results.  First, the interval between feeds of \nMIXED feeding mother-infant pairs was closer to BOTTLE feeding than to BREAST \nfeeding mother-infant pairs in the first week of life.  Second, we showed that only \nexclusive breast-feeding in the first week  and maternal education were related to 5 \ncontinued breast-feeding at 6 weeks.   Finally, we found that higher infant weight gain \nwas associated with more frequent feeding (lower feed-to-feed interval) among BREAST \nfed infants only. \nThe diaries demonstrated that, as expected, breast-fed infants were fed more \nfrequently (i.e., every 2.71 hours) relative to bottle-fed infants (every 3.25 hours).  10 \nInterestingly, mixed-fed infants adopted a feeding schedule (every 3.14 hours) that was \nmore similar to the bottle-fed than the breast-fed pattern.  For this reason, it may not \nalways be appropriate, as other reports have done, to report exclusive breast-feeding and \nmixed-feeding as a single category (Foster et al, 1995). In contrast to feed frequency \n(measured in this study by feed-to-feed interval, hours), the duration of feeds did not 15 \ndiffer by type of feed and was highly variable. One interpretation is that infants (and \nmothers) are still learning about feeding technique at this stage, and so the amount of \ntime required to complete a feed will vary, whereas the feed-to-feed interval would \nreflect the rate at which the infant digests a previous feed and the type of milk being fed. \nThe World Health Organization recommends that infants be breast-fed exclusively 20 \nuntil 6 months of age (World Health Organization, 2001).  However, sustaining breast-\nfeeding for this length of time is more the exception than the rule in the UK (and, indeed, \nin many countries).  A 1995 Health Department survey reported that while 68% of \nEarly infant feeding patterns 14\nmothers in England and Wales initiated breast-feeding, only 65% of these breast-fed for 6 \nweeks or longer, while only 32% breast-fed for at least 6 months (Foster et al, 1995).      \nThe relationship between the spontaneous feeding patterns reported in this study \nand breast-feeding continuation is complex, making interpretation more difficult than in \nexperimental-design studies (Salariya, 1978).  Only exclusive breast-feeding at the time 5 \nof the diary and maternal education were found to be associated with continuation of \nbreast-feeding for 6 weeks, while feeding schedule per se (i.e., feed-to-feed interval, \nduration) did not.   \nAlthough the relationship of infant weight gain to health is complex, optimum \nearly weight gain does appear to be an important protective factor against adult disease 10 \n(Eriksson et al, 1978).  Whereas the DARLING study (Dewey et al, 1992) found that \nbreast-fed infants showed the same rate of weight gain in the first 3 months in breast and \nbottle-fed infants, another study found  slower weight gain over the same period in \nbreast-fed infants (Nelson et al, 1989), and a more recent trial of a breast-feeding \npromotion intervention found that in the intervention arm (where more babies were 15 \nbreast-fed for longer) the overall weight gain was better throughout than in the control \narm (Kramer et al., 2002).  Our study found lower weight gain for breast-feeders, \nparticularly at 12 days, with an attenuated but persisting effect at 6 weeks.  This may in \npart reflect difficulty in establishing feeding in a population where breast-feeding is \ncomparatively rare and support from family and friends may be lacking.  Feed-to-feed 20 \ninterval was related to weight gain at 6 weeks for breast-feeders, but not for bottle or \nmixed feeders.  This finding contrasts with one earlier study (Agras, 1987) which found \nthat fewer, but larger, feeds in the first month of life were associated with greater \nEarly infant feeding patterns 15\nadiposity at age one to two years. However it is difficult to compare this with our study as \nthe time scale covered is so different. \nThe present study used a large data set of 502 feeding diaries, representing over \n25,000 hours of recording.  Previous studies have also used diaries, but sample sizes \ntended to be small or the subjects not representative of the general population (Wright et 5 \nal, 1980; H\u00f6rnell et al, 1999; Quandt, 1986).  Only one other study (H\u00f6rnell et al, 1999) \nhas examined infant feeding in such detail for such a large number of infants, and it found \nfrequency of feeding (recorded at age 2 weeks) to be a significant predictor of breast-\nfeeding continuation.  That study\u2019s Swedish sample consisted of well educated mothers \nwho had previously breast-fed a child for at least four months; thus, those data may not 10 \nbe transferable in a UK study population where most mothers have little or no breast-\nfeeding experience.   \nThese data do have some limitations; only half of the cohort completed diaries that \nwere both long and detailed enough to be usable and it was not possible to validate the \ncompleteness of diary entries.  Although there were varying rates of return from different 15 \nsectors of the study population, the longitudinal design and socio-demographic data \ncollected at recruitment allowed this to be quantified and explored by including socio-\ndemographic variables in the regressions.  There is also the possibility of self-selection \nbias with respect to feeding patterns: mothers feeding very frequently or having difficulty \nestablishing feeding, for instance, may not have completed and returned diaries.   20 \nAlthough infant weights were collected under routine clinical, rather than research, \nconditions, careful cross checking against other data available for each infant ensured that \nerroneous values would be a rarity.  Routinely collected weights have been a powerful \nEarly infant feeding patterns 16\nresource for previous studies (Wright et al, 1994; Wright et al, 2001) and make it \npossible to assemble much larger data sets than studies that rely on measurement by \nresearch staff. \nOur results suggest that in clinical settings, the advice given to parents of breast-\nfed and bottle-fed infants should reflect both the differences in their feeding patterns and 5 \nthe different factors associated with weight gain for these groups.  In particular, breast-\nfeeding mothers should be encouraged to feed their children frequently to promote \nhealthy weight gain, and not to supplement with bottle feeds, if sustaining breast-feeding \nis a priority.   \nEarly infant feeding patterns 17\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nProject support was provided by the Henry Smith Charity, SPARKS, and the Child \nGrowth Foundation.\nEarly infant feeding patterns 18\nREFERENCES \nAgras WS.
