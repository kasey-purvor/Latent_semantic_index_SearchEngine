INTRODUCTION\nSince the identification of carbon nanotubes ~CNTs!1 in\n1991, there has been considerable interest in their field emis-\nsion ~FE! properties with the observation of electron emis-\nsion at low macroscopic electric fields.2 The ease of deposi-\ntion over large areas has encouraged the belief that field\nemission displays ~FEDs! utilizing carbon nanotubes as emit-\nters can be an alternative technology for the next generation\nof flat panel displays based upon an emissive technology.3 A\nsuitable emissive display technology should be capable of\nhigh quality images with good color saturation and for large\nscreen diagonals should be capable of competing with active\nmatrix liquid crystal displays and plasma displays.3 It has\nbeen shown that CNTs can now be readily deposited over\nsubstrate areas only limited by the size of deposition reactor.\nSuch nanotip based emitters possess a distinct advantage\nover FED technologies, based on Spindt tips, which require\nmore complex fabrication lithography and processing. While\nelectron emission is possible from a single nanotube, for\npractical applications requiring suitable current densities,\nfilms or mats consisting of bundles of tubes are often\nemployed.4 In the high current density regime, CNTs also\nhave the added advantage that they are less susceptible to the\ncurrent induced electromigration of atoms due to the nature\nof the covalent bonding present. In addition to electron emis-\nsion from CNTs, it is further possible to observe electron\nemission from CNTs embedded in polymer composite\nmatrices5 where the presence of the polymer provides addi-\ntion mechanical support for the tubes as well as a way of\ntailoring the mass fraction of the nanotubes in their distribu-\ntion.\nElectron field emission from nanotip materials is not just\nconfined to CNTs, but has been observed from a wide variety\nof material systems such as SiC nanowires,6 MoO3\nnanobelts,7 tungsten nanowires,8 and copper sulphide nano-\nwire arrays.9 These studies demonstrate that considerable ef-\nfort is being placed into developing alternative nanotip based\nemitter materials.\nIn this regard, the recent report of the growth of carbon\nnanofibers ~CNFs! at room temperature10 is significant and\nopens up the possibility of the growth at low temperatures of\na cold cathode emitter material. These CNFs reported in Ref.\n10 also have the added advantage of being deposited using\nthe standard and mature technique of rf plasma enhanced\nchemical vapor deposition ~PECVD!. Growth at low tem-\nperatures using PECVD allows the potential use of plastic11\nor organic substrates and as a consequence, the choice and\ntreatment applied to the substrates is an important consider-\nation. It is generally agreed that for CNTs grown using Ni\ncatalysts, the size and distribution of the Ni, usually in the\nform of islands, can determine the average diameter of the\nresultant tubes.12 Thermal annealing of thin metal layers of\ntransition metals to form nanostructured surfaces is the most\ncommon way to form Co islands13 or Ni islands14\u2014the latter\nstudy concentrating on low temperature ~,500 \u00b0C! island\nformation. In this article, we report on the field emission\ncharacteristics of the room temperature deposited carbon\nnanofibers. A correlation between the FE characteristics and\nthe structure of the material is presented and demonstrate\nthat CNFs may be an alternative flat cathode material for\nlarge area FEDs. We also discuss the possible use of Ar ion\ntreatment on thin Ni metal films as an alternative method to\nproduce a nanostructured surface. Plasma treatment of a\ncatalyst surface has the advantage that it may be carried out\na low macroscopic temperatures thereby avoiding the need\nfor high temperature processing and the ability to employ\nglass as substrates.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD\nGlass slide substrates were cleaned using a standard\nthree stage chemical bath process on to which a 0.5 mm layer\nof Ni was thermally evaporated in a vacuum of\n231026 Torr.

A process pressure of 200 mTorr and a rf\npower of 300 W was used. The surface of the catalyst and the\nsubsequent film was examined using a Hitachi S4000 cold\nfield emission scanning electron microscope ~SEM!. The\nfield emission characteristics of the CNFs were examined\nusing a sphere-to-plane electrode geometry with a 5 mm\nstainless steel ball bearing suspended 30 mm above the\nsample with a high positive potential applied in a vacuum of\naround 1026 Torr. Although a spherical anode is used it is\nassumed that the electric field between the anode and the\nsurface of the sample can be modeled as a parallel plate. The\nvoltage is stepped up and down four times in 20 V incre-\nments and the macroscopic electric field is defined as the\napplied voltage divided by the anode-cathode separation.\nFurther details about the experimental setup can be found\nelsewhere.15 The threshold field E th is defined as the macro-\nscopic electric field, which gives an emission current of\n1 nA.\nIII. NANOFIBER GROWTH\nThe Ar plasma treatment of the Ni film produces a\nroughening of the film surface as shown by the circular fea-\ntures of Fig. 1~a!. These features are of approximately 3 mm\nin diameter and are surrounded by smaller circular islands of\nless than 500 nm in diameter, as can be observed in the\nhigher magnification image presented in Fig. 1~b!. It is\nknown from extensive studies of noble gas ion implantation\nthat \u2018\u2018bubbles\u2019\u2019 may form at sufficiently high dose and ion\nenergies.16 For example, 1017 Ar ions cm22 irradiated into a\ncopper foil at 60 keV ion energy at 20 \u00b0C showed the forma-\ntion of bubbles.16 In these studies, the bubbles are believed to\nconsist of gas molecules which can burst and result in blis-\nters. However, the energies of the Ar ions used in this study\nwould be tens of electron volts not keV and as a result we do\nnot believe that the features observed are bubbles of gas but\nrather are Ni metal. The formation of the Ni is most likely\ndue to thermal processing experienced by the film via a form\nof plasma etching though the role of adhesion of the metal to\nthe substrate may also be a contributory factor. It is interest-\ning to note that in the growth of CNTs on plastic substrates,\nthe formation of Ni islands was also attributed to plasma\nprocessing rather than adhesion.11\nNanofiber growth was then performed in the same reac-\ntor chamber, in which the sole deposition gas of CH4 was\nintroduced at a flow rate of 30 sccm and a pressure of 1 Torr.\nThe reverse power of the plasma was continually adjusted to\nkeep it as close to zero as possible in order to prevent sub-\nstantial substrate heating. The water cooled substrate table\ntemperature was monitored to be about 30 \u00b0C throughout the\ndeposition. Both the Ar ion treatment and nanofiber growth\nwere carried out on substrates held on the earthed electrode.\nIt has been previously shown that depositing from a hydro-\ncarbon gas in this reactor can readily lead to the formation of\ndisordered amorphous carbon thin films.17\nA SEM image of the surface after CH4 deposition shows\nthe growth structure of the nanofibers, arranged radially in\nclusters forming star shaped objects, approximately 50 mm\nacross as shown in Fig. 2~a!. The nanofibers are predomi-\nnantly lying on the surface rather than vertically aligned.\nToward the center of the cluster a higher concentration of\nfibers where diameters of 100\u2013400 nm can be seen. Such\nstructures are referred to here as carbon nanofibers rather\nthan the related CNTs which often possess smaller diameters.\nThe carbon nanofibers are observed to have well defined fea-\ntures including a rounded tip and a cylindrical shape as evi-\ndenced from a high resolution SEM of a group of nanofibers\non the outside edge of the star structure shown in Fig. 2~a!.\n@Due to the tilt of the sample when the SEM analysis was\ncarried out and the fact that the emissive electrons are analo-\ngous to light, we see light and dark regions of the encircled\nfiber of Fig. 2~b!, confirming a three-dimensional cylindrical\nshape.# At low growth temperatures, the diffusion of C in Ni\nis dominated by surface diffusion of C around Ni particles as\nopposed to C diffusion through the bulk of the metal.10,11 The\ngrowth mechanism is based on the decomposition and diffu-\nsion of carbon through the Ni, similar to that described pre-\nviously elsewhere in the low temperature growth of\nnanofibers.10 At sufficient high C concentration precipitation\nof the C occurs above the solubility limit resulting in nanofi-\nbers growth. No evidence of Ni is seen in the high resolution\nelectron microscope images and we conclude that in this case\nthe growth mechanism is not by the usual \u2018\u2018tip growth\u2019\u2019\nmode. We believe the large scale Ni islands remain strongly\nadhered to the surface resulting in base growth mode. In-\ndeed, for efficient Ni incorporation, it is necessary to lift the\nFIG. 1. ~a!

Ni particles with nanometer sized diameters\nand ~ii! on substrates that do not have strong interactions\nwith the metal. This tends to be the case for certain classes of\nNi films found in certain types of oxide whereby thermal\nannealing results in nm sized metal islands.14 In addition,\nMerkulov and co-workers showed that it is possible for more\nthan one nanotube to grow from a single Ni droplet if the\ndiameter is sufficiently large.18\nIV. FIELD EMISSION CHARACTERISTICS\nThe sample deposited at room temperature displayed ex-\ncellent emission characteristics with a threshold field of 5\nV\/mm as shown in Fig. 3~a!. The first two current-voltage\ncharacteristics are presented and no significant difference be-\ntween the two I \u2013 E characteristics is apparent. Further volt-\nage cycles show the same behavior and implies that there is\nno need for a \u2018\u2018conditioning\u2019\u2019 phase required for the onset of\nstable and reproducible emission. This is in contrast to what\nhas been reported in some rf PECVD amorphous carbon\n(a-C) thin films.15 In addition, there is no evidence of hys-\nteresis behavior between the upward and downward cycle of\neither I \u2013 E characteristic. This is an important result since\nany spread in the I \u2013 E characteristic could mean more com-\nplicated and expensive drive circuitry for a nanofiber based\nfield emission display.\nTo exclude the possibility of emission from the rough-\nened Ni film substrate, the emission characteristics prior to\nCH4 deposition were also tested. The results of the measure-\nments @Fig. 4~a!# revealed only background noise ~,50 pA!\nup to applied fields of 38 V\/mm. This confirms the emission\nobserved in Fig. 3~a! is due to the carbon growth stage. Fur-\nthermore, to confirm that the observed emission is from the\nCNFs rather than the surrounding amorphous carbon film,\nthe FE characteristics of an area on the same sample that did\nnot possess CNFs was tested by moving the probe anode.\nThe FE results, presented in Fig. 4~b!, show the difference in\nfield emission characteristics from that of Fig. 3~a!. First, the\nthreshold field for this part of the sample can be seen to be\napproximately 20 V\/mm, higher than reported previously and\nhas a peak emission current of 1028 A, lower than the peak\ncurrent of 1026 A seen in Fig. 3~a!. Second, it is apparent\nthere is a definite hysteresis between the upward and down-\nward cycle of the electric fields consistent with conditioning\ncycles, as discussed previously. From these results we be-\nlieve that the FE reported in Fig. 3~a! conclusively comes\nfrom the CNFs themselves.\nFIG. 2. ~a!

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nIn order to further explore the origins of the electron\nemission characteristics an analysis of the electron field\nemission I \u2013 E characteristics presented in Fig. 3~a! was per-\nformed using the standard Fowler\u2013Nordheim ~FN! equation\ngiven by\nI5\naAb2E2\nF\nexpS 2bF3\/2bE D , ~1!\nwhere a and b are constants, having the values\n1.5431026 A eV V22 and 6.833107 eV23\/2 V cm21, re-\nspectively. Variable A represents the emission area, F is the\nemission barrier and bE represents the local electric field. In\nthis context b represents the field enhancement factor and\nFig. 3~a! shows the I \u2013 E characteristic of the first ~upward!\nfield cycle plotted in the usual FN coordinates.19 The slope of\nthe line is 2bF3\/2\/b and for a work function ~barrier height!\nof 5 eV, a value of 4180 is found for the field enhancement\nfactor b. Large values of enhancement factor have been re-\nported previously from field emission measurements made\nover large areas rather than from individual tubes. For ex-\nample, Bonard et al. reported that a field enhancement factor\nof 1800 was inferred from a large area measurement ~1.88\ncm2 with an anode-cathode separation of 500 mm! whereas\nfor single tubes, a value of b of only 230 was reported.20 In\nanother study, field enhancement factors of several thousand\nwere also report by Bonard et al. from a film of single wall\nCNTs, however, no current saturation in the high current\nregime was reported in that study21 unlike in the present\ncase.\nSome caution must be exercised in the FN analysis of\nthe I \u2013 E characteristic of Fig. 3~a! since there will be a dis-\ntribution of field enhancement factors due to the different\nlocal workfunctions, a distribution in nanofiber lengths, radii,\nand screening due to proximity effects. In addition, a large\nvalue of enhancement factor can be inferred in the presence\nof a shallow I \u2013 E characteristic due to a bulk transport lim-\nited emission behavior.22 In this case, despite the apparent\nlinearity of the FN plot, the presence of a bulk limited trans-\nport emission process complicates the use of the Fowler\u2013\nNordheim analysis. The possibility of bulk limited conduc-\ntion was not considered in the original formulation of the\nFowler\u2013Nordheim theory of emission from metals due to\nhigh conductivity of the cathode. From Fig. 2~b!, we can\nestimate the radius of curvature r of the emitter to be about\n100 nm and from an enhancement factor of approximately\n4200, would suggest an emitting structure of height h, 420\nmm based upon the well known approximation of b;h\/r .\nSuch an emitter structure is not observed in Fig. 2 where an\nupper emitter length of 25 mm can be seen giving rise to an\nenhancement factor of 250. We are able to eliminate space-\ncharge limited current ~SCLC! effects since the magnitude of\nthe current in Fig. 3~a! is only 631027 A. Furthermore, in\nthe high current regime the current is observed, as shown in\nthe inset of Fig. 3~a!, to follow a power law dependence on\nvoltage ~field!, I}Vn, with n53.0. While a high value of n\n52.5 was reported for the saturated current density by\nRupesinghe et al.23 and attributed to electron beam interac-\ntion from neighboring emitters and hence the onset of a\nspace charge saturation, the level of current in that study was\nmuch larger than that observed. The value of n found in the\npresent study is also significantly different from n51.5 or\nn52 corresponding to a SCLC in either vacuum or in a thin\nfilm semiconductor.24 We believe that the electron emission\nfrom the structure at the low applied field was primarily from\nthe nanofiber structures as the surrounding amorphous car-\nbon film has a much higher threshold field of approximately\n20 V\/mm. It is also possible that the nano-scale dielectric\ninhomogeneities present close to the carbon nanofibers could\nhelp to increase the observed enhancement factor.25\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, carbon nanofibers were grown by plasma\nenhanced chemical vapor deposition of CH4 at room tem-\nperature on Ni catalyst on glass substrates. The observed\nstructures displayed excellent electron field emission with a\nlow threshold field of 5 V\/mm. A Fowler\u2013Nordheim analysis\ngives rise to an apparently high field enhancement factor of\nabout 4200. However, we believe that the emission of elec-\ntrons at low fields is due to field enhancement at the tip, but\nat higher currents the emission becomes bulk limited. We\nhave also shown that it is possible to produce nanostructured\nNi films using plasma ion treatment to act as a catalyst ma-\nterial and that the emission is not from the surrounding amor-\nphous carbon.\nFIG. 4. ~a!
