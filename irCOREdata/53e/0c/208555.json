This is all the more remarkable because they have been part \nof a brawn drain that has lasted for more than a century. According to Bale (1991), the brawn \ndrain is a process in which the athletic and sporting talent of lesser-developed countries is \nsiphoned off by colleges and professional teams from more economically advanced nations. \nIn this case, it is Irish footballers that have been siphoned off by professional teams in the \nEnglish League.\n2\n Though there is a long tradition of Irish athletes\n3\n and boxers emigrating in \norder to take up careers in professional sport, the numbers involved are relatively small when \ncompared to those who have left to play professional football.\n \nThis is probably because the \nnational leagues (North and South) have been unable to provide significant amounts of full-\ntime employment, though association football (or soccer) has long since been one of the more \npopular sports on the island of Ireland (Sugden and Bairner 1993).  While these migrant \nplayers receive a remarkable degree of coverage in the Irish mass media and, to a lesser \nextent, in the English equivalent, they have generally been ignored in studies of sports labour \nmigration and of Irish emigration. \nThis paper seeks to overcome this deficiency by analysing the overall structure of the Irish \nbrawn drain.\n4\n In doing so, it will draw upon world systems and resource dependency theories \nto show how the brawn drain was created, and subsequently extended, during the second half \nof the twentieth century. More specifically, I shall argue that the recent spread of youth \npolicies among the major English clubs has placed additional constraints on the development \nof the football industry within Ireland.  \n \nCORE - PERIPHERY RELATIONS AND LABOUR MIGRATION \nThe most influential accounts of sport labour migration are derived from world systems \ntheory (Wallerstein 1974) and from the neo-marxist dependency theory (Cardoso and Faletto \n1979). Though these contain some major flaws (Hettne 1983) I would argue that they provide \na useful starting point for the analysis of uneven economic development in those cases where \nindustries compete for the same resources on a cross-national basis. This is primarily because \nthey seek to relate rates of development to international exchanges between nationally based \nindustries, rather than simply referring to their internal production arrangements.  The \nemphasis on trade and exchange is important because the primary aim of this paper is to \n \n 4 \nexplain how a particular pattern of inter-industry relations, that is between the football \nindustries of Ireland and England, inhibit development within Ireland. As Maguire and Bale \n(1994: 11-12) argue, \u2018the reason why Hungary loses its best footballers and why Kenya loses \nits best runners cannot be explained by events in those specific countries\u2019. \nSociologists and geographers who draw on this tradition claim that the organizations at the \ncore of the global sports system tend to dominate the sports audiences and labour markets of \nthe periphery (Arbena 1994; Bale and Sang 1994; Klein 1989; Maguire and Bale 1994). This \ngenerally occurs in three ways. First, the commodification and globalization of sport are \ndriven by transnational organizations that have the power to generate wealth at the expense of \nclubs in the periphery. For example, major media corporations are able to encourage \nspectators in the periphery to watch satellite broadcasts of \u2018live\u2019 sporting events from major \nEuropean leagues at the expense of less glamorous versions on offer at local stadia. Second, \nthe appeal and, ultimately, the domination of the core leagues are enhanced by their ability to \nattract athletic talent from across the globe. This inevitably leads to the deskilling of the \nworld\u2019s minor leagues. In addition, the presence of foreign stars adds to the appeal of satellite \nbroadcasts for audiences in the (semi-) periphery who may prefer to watch their compatriots \nplaying overseas on TV rather than in the local stadia. Finally, the countries and regions of \nthe periphery are excluded from the centre of decision-making in global sports and are, as a \nconsequence, unable to change these processes of domination. They must instead depend on \nwhatever financial support is channelled in their direction from the international sporting \nauthorities. Perhaps the most controversial claim advanced by writers within this perspective \nis that little genuine development is possible while this pattern of relations is in place. That \nwhich does occur is termed dependent development because it is constrained by unequal \nexchanges with the developed core (Maguire and Bale 1994).  \nEmpirical support for these claims can be found in studies of sport in Latin America and \nAfrica. Arbena (1994), for example, in his examination of the migration of soccer players \nfrom Latin America to Europe, finds that a recruitment relationship has developed between \nvarious South American countries and wealthy European clubs, principally in Spain and Italy. \nThese are able to extract the best players from Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay by offering \nsignificantly higher salaries than those available locally. The clubs in these countries are, in \nany case, frequently forced to sell their best young players in order to survive. The result is \nthat the subsequent standard of play, the match attendances and the gate receipts decline, with \n \n 5 \nthe result that it becomes even more difficult for clubs to survive without selling their best \nplayers. \nSimilar experiences have observed in the Dominican Republic where local fans have \nwatched US and Japanese franchises sign up most of the top baseball players (Klein 1989, \n1991). Some of these franchises, such as the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers, \nhave taken the additional step of establishing academies in the Dominican Republic to locate, \nsign, and refine talent before sending it to North America for further development.  \n \nUneven Development and Resource Dependency \nIt should be emphasized that this research is only concerned with the link between the \nrecruitment practices of English clubs and the uneven development of the football industry in \nEngland and Ireland. A full assessment of the underdevelopment of Irish football would \nrequire consideration of a range of factors beyond the scope of this study. These would \ninclude the split between the southern and northern clubs in the 1920s, the management and \norganizational capabilities of the respective football associations,\n5\n the negative impact of \nsatellite broadcasts of English football on attendances in Ireland, as well as competition from \nother sports for players and spectators. The Irish League (Northern Ireland) has also suffered \nfrom repeated outbreaks of sectarian violence notably since the \u2018troubles\u2019 emerged in the late \n1960s (Sugden and Bairner 1993; Brodie 1980). Once it is accepted that these factors have \nhad an influence then the underdevelopment of Irish football cannot be attributed wholly to \nthe English League's status as a buyer and the Irish leagues' status as sellers of labour. \n Nevertheless, my argument is that the loss of skilled labour has constrained the \ndevelopment of Irish football, thereby reinforcing its subordinate status in relation to the \nEnglish football industry. There are two strands to this thesis. First, professional football is \nunusual, even among labour intensive industries, in that the economic and sporting success is \nbased entirely on its employees. The fact that labour is of critical importance to a club\u2019s \nperformance is not in itself the source of the problem (Pfeffer and Salancik 1978: 47). The \nproblem only arises when teams are unable to hire, or retain, the best available footballers \nbecause other clubs possess greater economic power. In this particular instance, the problem \nis compounded by the fact that the other clubs are part of a different and wealthier league. \n The second part of this argument, which concerns the subordinate position held by the \nIrish leagues, points to growing differences in economic power. My argument is that these \n \n 6 \ndifferences have placed further constraints on the growth of football as a commercial industry \nwithin Ireland. This development may be fruitfully analysed through Pfeffer and Salancik\u2019s \n(1978) influential resource dependency theory of inter-organizational relations. Though \nPfeffer and Salancik\u2019s model has different aims and orientations to neo-marxist dependency \ntheory (e.g. Cardoso and Faletto 1979) it is similar in that it shares a relational concept of \npower, as well as the belief that power relations may be inextricably linked to those of \ndependency. Pfeffer and Salancik's basic claim is that organizations are not autonomous, or \nself-directed, because they are involved in various forms of interdependencies with their \nenvironments. They argue that organizations must acquire resources (e.g., finance, labour) \nfrom the external environment in order to survive. Since these resources frequently come \nfrom other organizations the focal organization may become dependent on those external \norganizations that can provide them with the necessary resources. Such dependence leads to \nthe external organizations exerting some constraint or control over those who depend upon \nthem (see also Pfeffer 1987).  \nIn relation to inter-organizational relations between English and Irish football clubs, the \nstarting point is that the English League constantly needs new players while Irish clubs \nusually need to sell in order to survive. For example, the sale of Paul McGrath to Manchester \nUnited in 1982 provided St Patrick\u2019s Athletic with \u00a330,000, which was promptly used to clear \na number of major debts (Dervan 1994). The problem for Irish clubs is that Ireland is but one \nsource of new players for English clubs while it is the only source for Irish clubs.\n6\n English \nfootball has, for example, a long tradition of recruiting players from Scotland (Moorhouse \n1994) as well as from within its own jurisdiction. Other new sources, such as Australia and \nScandinavia, have also emerged since the 1970s. The choice of sources available to English \nteams means that transfers between Irish and English clubs are not of equal importance to \nboth sides. Consequently, Irish clubs are unable to exert much control over their English \ncounterparts though they may control access to Irish players. If anything, the balance of power \nlies in the other direction once it is accepted that Irish clubs need the income from transfer \nfees more than English clubs need to buy Irish players. \nThis asymmetry in market relations is compounded by the fact that Irish players are \ngenerally eager to sign for English sides because they offer better economic and sporting \nopportunities (Brady 1980; Dervan 1994; Stapleton 1991). By contrast, clubs in Northern \nIreland and in the Irish Republic can only survive by employing part-time and amateur players \n \n 7 \nthough some occasionally employ a small number of full-time professionals (Brodie 1980; \nHannigan 1998). Despite these qualifications, Irish clubs are able to retain some degree of \nbargaining power over transfer fees, provided they are able to control access to Irish players. \nIn order to understand how the brawn drain has changed I shall first describe the overall \nscale of this phenomenon before explaining how changes in recruitment methods have \ntransformed relations between the Irish and English football industries. I shall then \nconcentrate on the recruitment activities of the largest English clubs because they have led the \nbrawn drain from its earliest days.  \n \nDATA AND METHODS \nThe empirical data for this research was assembled from a diverse range of published \nsecondary sources. Information on footballers from Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic \nwho have appeared in the English League was taken from Hugman's (1992) English League \nPlayers Records 1946-92.  I would like to emphasize here that while migration from Northern \nIreland to England is essentially a form of internal migration within the United Kingdom I \nhave, nevertheless, included it in this analysis precisely because it has had a league of its own \n(the Irish League). This data was updated to the 1995-96 season using various editions of \nRothman\u2019s Football Yearbook. Hugman (1992) lists, among other things, each player\u2019s place \nof birth, date of birth, form of recruitment (transfer or apprentice), year of recruitment, and \nthe names of the clubs that employed them in Ireland (where relevant) and in England. \nPlayers who were employed on a non-contract, or loan, basis were excluded, as were those \nwho had a contract but never actually appeared for the first team. \nPlace of birth was used as the initial selection criterion (e.g., Belfast, Dublin). This \nvariable initially contained a small element of bias, as it did not account for the possibility \nthat the player, or his family, may have emigrated to England before he became a professional \nfootballer. Similarly, the families of some players who were born in England may have \nemigrated to Ireland. To address this problem, the information on place of birth was \ncompared with those contained in biographies of international players (Brodie 1980; Cullen \n1993; McGarrigle 1996). Since this exercise only produced a minor reduction in the overall \nnumber of Irish players I am confident that this information is reasonably reliable (less than \nfive per cent of the cases had to be re-classified).  \n \n 8 \nHaving identified the initial employing club, two additional variables were created to \ndescribe the divisional status and size of each club at the time it signed any Irish player. \nWhile the data on divisional status were obtained directly from Robinson (1998), I had to use \nthe average home attendance figures for each season as an indicator of club size (Tabner \n1992; Rothman\u2019s Football Yearbooks 1991-1995). The advantage of attendance figures is that \nthey give an estimation of club income for a period in which this was mostly based on gate \nreceipts. However, the disadvantage is that they do not capture the additional purchasing \npower provided by wealthy directors or owners. Given that most clubs were either promoted \nor relegated during the course of this period, the process of data coding also became even \nmore painstaking as the size categories tended to change according to the clubs' success or \nfailure. Nevertheless, clubs were initially ranked in descending order for each season, using \ntheir average home attendance figures, before dividing them into roughly equal numbers of \nlarge, medium, and small.  \nThe overall result is a unique database containing nominal and ordinal level data on the \nentire population of Irish players (North and South) who made at least one appearance in the \nEnglish leagues between 1946 and 1995. This material was supplemented by journalists\u2019 \naccounts of the \u2018Irish connection\u2019 with two of England\u2019s leading clubs, namely Arsenal \n(McGarrigle 1991) and Manchester United  (McGarrigle 1990; Scally 1998). Special attention \nis paid to the practices of these clubs because they imported the most Irish players. \n  \nTHE CONSTANT FLOW \nOverall, a total of 563 Irish players have appeared in the English league since the end of \nthe Second World War (Table I). While this figure may not appear very large when spread \nover a 50-year period it worth noting that only Scotland has supplied more players to English \nfootball (McGovern 1999). Furthermore, soccer has always attracted fewer players and \nspectators in Ireland than the Gaelic games of hurling and football (Cronin 1999; Sugden and \nBairner 1993). More significantly, this figure does not represent the total outflow, as not all of \nthose who were signed by English clubs succeeded in appearing for the first team (Hannigan \n1998). It also excludes those who were signed by Scottish clubs (Moorhouse 1986: 257). \n \n 9 \nTable I. Irish signings by English League clubs, 1946-1995 \nYears (ten) N.

More Irish players were hired in \nthis period (1946-55) than at any time subsequently (Table I). Though the Irish leagues had \nalready supplied many players to English clubs before the War the amount exported \nimmediately after the War was exceptional. Much of this may be explained by a post-war \nlabour shortage, the rapid expansion of the League in the years immediately after the War, \nand by the effects of the conflict itself. Some 75 professional footballers were killed in action \n(Russell 1997: 124) and an unknown number of others were injured. It is also likely that a \nsignificant number of those who would otherwise have become footballers may have been \nkilled or injured. English clubs may also have been attracted to Irish players because their \nfitness levels and skills had been maintained by playing in leagues that had continued \nthroughout the War.  \nPerhaps the most remarkable feature of the Irish brawn drain has been the unrelenting \nnature of the outward flow. English clubs have imported players from Ireland during every \nseason since 1946.\n7\n The level of recruitment activity has also remained fairly stable with \napproximately 10 players hired each year, after the initial period of mass recruitment between \n1946 and 1955. There have, however, been considerable changes over time in the numbers \nhired from Northern Ireland and from the Irish Republic. Apart from the period 1946-55 \nwhen similar numbers of players were imported from the North and South, considerably more \nof the players came from Northern Ireland in the period up to the mid-1980s. Thereafter, the \nproportion of Northern Irish signings declined steadily (from 29.7 per cent in 1946-55 to 11.5 \nper cent in 1986-95) while that of the Irish Republic initially declined before rising again, \n \n 10 \nnotably from the mid-1980s. Since then, almost twice as many players have been recruited \ndirectly from the Irish Republic (Table I).  \nThis development probably reflects the growth of the game in the Republic in an era when \nthe national team enjoyed unprecedented success under its English manager, Jack Charlton \n(Cronin 1999: 129-142; Hannigan 1998: 20-28). Qualification for the European \nChampionship Finals in 1988, followed by World Cups in 1990 and 1994 led to an \noutpouring of fervour for a game that had previously aroused hostility among cultural \nnationalists. Significantly, the number of registered players grew dramatically from \napproximately 65,000 players in 1986 to 175,320 in 1995 with some 50,000 having been \nadded in the last five years of this period (Irish Times 1.6.1996). Nevertheless, the overall \ndecline in transfers, particularly from Northern Ireland, may also indicate a relative decline in \nskill levels when compared with the increase in players signed from Scandinavia and \nAustralia (McGovern 1999).  \n Finally, it is worth noting that the consistency and durability of this outward flow, and the \nurban origins of those involved, contrasts sharply with the general characteristics of Irish \nemigration to Britain. In general, Irish emigration is strongly influenced by how the Irish \nlabour market performs in relation to that of Britain, especially in comparisons of after-tax \nwages and unemployment rates (NESC 1991: 111-124). Accordingly, emigration tends to \nincrease during periods of economic stagnation and decrease during relatively periods of \neconomic growth. By contrast, the migration of footballers, which is determined by the \namount of direct recruitment undertaken by English employers, has remained remarkably \nstable in terms of direction and volume for most of the late twentieth century. Consequently, \nthe Irish experience of immigration during the prosperous years of the 1970s and the 1990s \nwas not matched by a reversal, or even a decline, in the brawn drain. \nFurthermore, the urban and predominantly east coast origins of football migrants (e.g., \nBelfast, Derry, Dublin and Cork) differs from that of ordinary emigrants. The latter have \ntypically consisted of a mixture of urban and rural with relatively higher proportions from \nrural communities along the western seaboard (NESC 1991: 75-77; MacLaughlin 1994: 50). \nThis is not surprising once it is appreciated that soccer has traditionally been an urban \nphenomenon in Ireland, with Dublin and Belfast as its leading strongholds. \n \n 11 \nCHANGES IN RECRUITMENT PRACTICES \nUntil the 1980s, most Irish players were purchased from Irish League and League of \nIreland clubs, though a growing number of Irish apprentices were beginning to appear for \nEnglish sides. Under the so-called retain and transfer system Irish clubs receive a transfer fee \nafter the player has separately agreed the terms and conditions of his employment. Under the \ntrainee (previously apprenticeship) method, Irish-based scouts invite talented schoolboy \nplayers to England for trials. Those that impress are offered an opportunity to join the club as \nan apprentice and paid accordingly.\n8\n A significant feature of this method is that no transfer \nfees are required since those involved are too young to be employed as part-time \nprofessionals by Irish sides.  \nThe mid-1980s marks a watershed in buyer-supplier relations between the Irish and \nEnglish leagues because it was the first time that those recruited as apprentices outnumbered \nthose recruited as transfers (Figure I). This event might have been expected, as it was the \noutcome of a trend that had been developing steadily over a 30-year period. In each of the \nprevious decades, there was evidence that increasing numbers of Irish players were being \nhired through the trainee system.  For instance, the number of trainees increased from a total \nof 8 (5 NI and 3 IRL) in 1946-55 to 59 (23 NI and 36 IRL) in 1986-95 while transfers \ndeclined from 157 to 42 over the same period.  \nFigure I Transfers and trainees from Ireland 1946-1995\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n1946-55 1956-65 1966-75 1976-85 1986-95\nNI transfer\nIRL transfer\nNI trainee\nIRL trainee\n \n 12 \n \nThe rise in the number of trainees was primarily the result of a strategic decision taken by \nsome leading English clubs to invest in scouting and nursery-style arrangements. Prior to the \n1980s most scouts were unpaid enthusiasts or ex-players who had informal relationships with \nparticular clubs. Such relationships were gradually replaced by more formal arrangements, \nsome of which included employment on a part-time basis. One of the most well-known is Pat \nDevlin, a former League of Ireland player and manager of a League of Ireland club. In his \nscouting capacity he has procured dozens of trialists, numerous apprentices and more than a \nfew successful players for Liverpool, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United. Devlin\u2019s \nview, like that of other scouts, is that he is offering opportunities to teenagers that simply do \nnot exist in Ireland: \u2018We\u2019re hypocrites in this country, we have a national league, and a \nnational association, and yet, we\u2019re sending our best players away all the time. But how can \nwe say that they shouldn\u2019t go? What have we got to offer them here?\u2019 (quoted in Hannigan \n1998: 82). \nIn addition to networks of scouts, some of the major English clubs also began to organize \ncoaching schools in Belfast and Dublin in the late 1980s. Manchester United, for example, \nintroduced a School of Excellence to Belfast while Everton entered into a sponsorship \narrangement with the Dublin amateur club Home Farm. The latter arrangement allowed \nEverton to have first choice over the young talent discovered by one of Ireland\u2019s leading \nnursery clubs. Similarly, one of Liam Brady\u2019s first acts on being appointed Director of Youth \nDevelopment at Arsenal was to establish a formal link with the Dublin and District \nSchoolboy\u2019s League (Hannigan 1998: 27). Brady, a former Arsenal, Juventus and Republic of \nIreland star had himself played in the same schoolboy league before being signed as an \napprentice by Arsenal. Even Tranmere Rovers, a medium sized club, established a nursery \narrangement with a Dublin boy\u2019s club, Stella Maris, by using the local connections of their \nmanager, John Aldridge, a former Irish international (Hannigan 1998: 27). Other clubs have \nalso begun discussions with Irish youth sides about similar arrangements. These practices \nenable clubs to monitor potential players as they enter their teens, that is, before they can be \nlegally signed as trainees at the age of fifteen years. Keith Gillespie, for example, started \ntravelling from Belfast to Manchester United at the age of twelve years (Observer 19.2.1995). \nThese measures, which form part of a widely publicized investment in youth policies by \nleading English clubs (FourFourTwo, February 1995; Guardian 1.12.1999), can be \n \n 13 \ninterpreted as a shift from a market-based solution to the problem of finding skilled labour \ntowards one based on internal hierarchical arrangements (McGovern 1999). The principal \nadvantages of this approach are that it enables employers to procure skills in an industry that \nis characterized by skill shortages at the highest level while simultaneously providing a much \ngreater degree of control over labour quality than under the transfer system.\n \nThe fact that \nEnglish clubs are producing an increasing proportion of players in this way suggests that they \nhave simply adopted a rational response to the problem of procuring scarce resources at \nrelatively low costs. What is of particular interest to this study is that practices that were \ndeveloped within an English context have been extended across the Irish Sea. \nIn short, the activities of the schools and scouts have the same effect as those of the \nbaseball academies in the Dominican Republic (Klein 1991): they locate and remove the \nfinest natural resources from the local environment and send them to one where they can \nenjoy greater economic and sporting opportunities. \n \nTHE RECRUITING CLUBS \nMuch of the recruitment activity was undertaken by the better supported and richer clubs \nbased in the major cities of London, Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester. This group of \napproximately 30 clubs has enjoyed some of the highest average attendance figures for all \nleague clubs and lengthy membership of the first division (or Premiership after 1992).\n9\n For \ninstance, they imported more than half (58.8 per cent) of all players between 1946 and 1995.\n \n \nThe top 10, which hired one-third (34.3 per cent) of all Irish players, contains some of the \ncurrent (and a few former) powerhouses of English football: Manchester United, Arsenal, \nMiddlesbrough, Sunderland, Brighton & Hove Albion, Burnley, Leeds United, Doncaster \nRovers, Luton Town and Wolverhampton Wanderers. \nThe significance of club size (and divisional status) is even more apparent in the difficult \nprocess of finding talented apprentices. Though the largest clubs only accounted for half (54.6 \nper cent) of all transfers they hired more than two-thirds (69.5 per cent) of all apprentices \n(Table II). They also showed a distinct tendency to recruit a larger percentage of their Irish \nplayers as trainees (33.6 per cent) than either the medium (18.8 per cent) or small (27.4 per \ncent) sized clubs. By 1995 the clubs in the two top divisions had not only bought more Irish \nplayers (75.2 per cent) they had also produced the vast majority (84.7 per cent) of apprentices. \n \n 14 \n First division clubs alone had signed just under half (43.7 per cent) of the transfers and more \nthan half (56.7 per cent) of the apprentices. \n \nTable II. Method of recruitment by club size 1946-1995 \n Source type \nClub size Transfers Trainees \nLarge 54.6 (215) 69.5 (109) \nMedium 34.0 (134) 19.7 (31) \nSmall 11.4 (45) 10.8 (17) \nTotal 100.0 (394) 100.0 (157) \n   Note: Chi-square=11.879; df=2; p<.005 \n \nThe influence of club size is reinforced by evidence of increasing concentration of Irish \nrecruitment activity, at least until the foundation of the Premiership in the early 1990s. After \nthe first ten years the total number of clubs that imported Irish players declined slightly before \nrising again to half of all league clubs in 1986-95 (Table III). However, the percentage signed \nby the 10 leading recruiters in each period increased for the first thirty years (from 43.3 per \ncent in 1946-55 to 54.2 per cent in 1976-85) before declining in the final ten years (to 41 per \ncent). Since a similar trend is reflected for transfers this shows that recruitment had become \nincreasingly concentrated among the largest clubs, until they started importing players from \nScandinavia, Northern Europe, Canada and Australia after the early 1990s (McGovern 1999). \nThe apprentice method was, by contrast, highly concentrated among the top 10 clubs for the \nfirst thirty years after the War though the numbers involved were initially quite small. Though \nit has fallen since the 1970s, the proportion was still close to half of all trainees by 1995 (45.8 \nper cent). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15 \nTable III Concentration of Irish recruitment among English clubs 1946-95 \nYears Proportion of all \nclubs \nTop ten clubs Transfers by top \nten clubs  \nTrainees by top \nten clubs \n1946-55 58.7*(54) 43.3 (75) 43.3 (68) 62.5 (5) \n1956-65 52.2 (48) 54.3 (58) 52.8 (44) 63.5 (14) \n1966-75 45.6 (42) 55.0 (55) 51.4 (34) 61.6 (21) \n1976-85 40.2 (37) 54.2 (44) 56.3 (28) 52.9 (18) \n1986-95 50.0 (46) 41.0 (41) 31.0 (15) 45.8 (26) \nNote: *This percentage is an underestimate as it is based on a total of 92 clubs. There were \nonly 88 clubs in the league from 1946-50. \n \nNevertheless, it should be emphasized that the recruitment of Irish players was not simply \nthe work of a select group of leading clubs. Despite the degree of concentration among the \nleading clubs, the top 20 recruiting clubs for the entire period between 1946 and 1995 only \naccounted for little more than half (55.1 per cent) of all Irish signings.  A further indicator of \nthe scale of the brawn drain is the proportion of English clubs that signed players directly \nfrom Ireland. Significantly, virtually all of the clubs that appeared in the English leagues since \n1946 have done so (95 out of 98). In other words, Ireland is so well established as a source of \nplayers that almost all league clubs have imported Irish players at some stage in their history. \nFurthermore, half (50.0 per cent) continued to do so at the end of this period.  \n \nManchester United and Arsenal \nTwo of the largest Premiership (first division) clubs, Manchester United and Arsenal, \nstand out for their exceptional tendency to sign Irish footballers. They have, for instance, been \nthe leading importers of Irish players (68 players or 12 per cent of the total) in general and, \nwithin that, the leading producers of Irish trainees (33 trainees or 21 per cent of the total). \nManchester United was also among the first clubs to develop a youth policy within Britain \nand in the 1960s it became the first to incorporate Irish teenagers into these arrangements \n(Dunphy 1991: 280-81). However, the best indicator of Arsenal and Manchester United\u2019s \nlong-standing attraction to Irish sources is that they were the only two clubs among the top \n \n 16 \nten destinations for Irish players in each decade since 1946. Since both clearly have a well-\nestablished tradition for importing Irish players, it is worth examining their practices in detail. \nThe strength of the \u2018Irish connection\u2019 at these clubs has been documented by McGarrigle \n(1990; 1991) and Scally (1998) in fan oriented publications that describe the various Irish \nplayers, managers and scouts employed by these clubs. These reveal that both were among the \nfirst to appoint talent scouts in Ireland. According to McGarrigle (1990), the Manchester \nUnited connection can be traced back to the 1930s when the then manager Scott Duncan \nbegan to visit Ireland for representation games involving the United's Belfast-born player, \nWalter MacMillen. The club later appointed two scouts in the 1960s, Bob Harper (later Bob \nBishop) for Northern Ireland and Billy Behan for the Republic. These scouts sent \u2018scores of \nhopefuls\u2019 to Manchester as well as such stars as Johnny Carey, Johnny Giles, Paul McGrath, \nGeorge Best, Sammy McIlroy and Norman Whiteside. However, McGarrigle (1991: 134) \nclaims that it is Arsenal who has established the most formidable scouting network in Ireland. \nWhile the club has, like Manchester United, one scout in Northern Ireland its chief scout in \nthe Republic is supported by a team of five. It has, as indicated earlier, also formed nursery \nstyle links with Dublin schoolboy leagues. \nThe success of Arsenal\u2019s youth training scheme is illustrated by the source and low cost of \nthose recruited since 1970 (Appendix 1). This shows that Arsenal relied heavily on the \napprentice method while the Manchester club was much more inclined to buy established, older \nplayers from Irish league clubs. Consequently, Arsenal\u2019s extensive use of the apprenticeship \nsystem enabled them to recruit Irish teenagers at a very low cost while Manchester United have \nhad to pay a number of transfer fees. Even so, these fees look extremely modest when compared \nto the record-breaking transfer fees that this club paid out during the same period (e.g., Bryan \nRobson \u00a31.3 million, Roy Keane \u00a33.75 million, Andy Cole \u00a37 million). Given that these are \ntwo of the major employers of Irish players, this suggests that Irish footballers have been \nrecruited rather cheaply.\n10\n Such a claim would be consistent with existing research on sport \nlabour migration which shows that the donor leagues from the developing world generally act as \na cheap source of sporting talent for clubs from the more economically developed parts of the \nworld (Klein 1991; Maguire and Bale 1994).\n11\n \nSocial ties and recruitment networks, such as those that created the \u2018Irish connection\u2019 at \nthese two clubs, are not unusual in determining how, and where, emigrants find employment \n(Portes 1995; Tilly and Tilly 1998: 190-94). Corcoran (1993), for instance, has shown how \n \n 17 \nthe presence of friends, relatives or people of similar ethnic origins all influence the \ndestinations chosen by Irish emigrants, as well as their subsequent chances of procuring \nemployment. Critically, once such links are established they are likely to sustain themselves \n(Tilly and Tilly 1998: 190). In this case, the phenomenon is probably reinforced by two \nrelated factors.  \nFirst, a tradition of employing Irish players produces a \u2018demonstration effect\u2019 that is likely \nto attract other Irish hopefuls. Newcomers may, for example, be comforted by the knowledge \nthat other young Irish footballers have already been given the opportunity to play first team \nfootball at these clubs. From the employer\u2019s perspective, the manager and coaching staff will \nbe reassured by the knowledge that players from similar backgrounds have proved successful \nin the past. Second, the presence of other Irish players makes it easier for apprentices to adapt \nto their surroundings. Former Arsenal stars, Liam Brady and Frank Stapleton, and Manchester \nUnited\u2019s Paul McGrath have all acknowledged how the company of senior Irish professionals \nacted to provide a \u2018home from home\u2019 (Brady 1980; Stapleton 1991; Scally 1998: 119). The \ncorollary is that these clubs were able to retain young, homesick, employees who may never \npreviously have travelled outside their native country. In short, the reputation which Arsenal \nand Manchester United have established for hiring Irish players carries a significant element \nof self-perpetuation. \n \nCONCLUSION \nIn an industry where labour is the most critical of resources, the economic power of the \nwealthiest clubs provides the means to dominate the labour market to the point where they \ncan buy the kind of success that less powerful clubs can never hope to achieve. This virtuous \ncircle is a well-known phenomenon within American football where large-city teams \ndominate by purchasing emerging players from smaller-city teams (Leifer 1995: 201). What is \nperhaps not so obvious is that this success may be achieved in global sports, such as \nassociation football, at the expense of the same industry in other countries. In such cases, the \nless powerful clubs in the donor leagues are trapped in a vicious circle in which they lose \nplayers and fans to richer foreign clubs. This, in turn, ensures that the quality of the spectacle \nthat they offer remains relatively low, with the result that they are unable to achieve the kind \nof competitive and commercial success that would enable them to recruit and retain better \nplayers and larger crowds. \n \n 18 \nFrom the evidence presented here, the association football industry in Ireland would \nappear to contain many of the characteristic features of this situation. Like Chile and Uruguay \nin football (Arbena 1994) and the Dominican Republic in baseball (Klein 1991), it has \nwatched its finest sporting talent leave to join one of the wealthier leagues at the core of \nEuropean football. If anything, the scale and duration of the Irish brawn drain is probably \ngreater since English clubs have brought relatively large numbers of players across the Irish \nSea for most of the twentieth century. While much of this activity has been the work of the \nlarger and more prestigious clubs, the domination of the English football industry is such that \nall of its clubs have hired players from Ireland at some stage. More recently, the extension of \nyouth policies into Ireland has deepened the brawn drain because it has enabled English sides to \nacquire Irish players at an increasingly younger age. Such actions, which business analysts \nwould describe as the backward integration of the supply chain, enabled English clubs to \nreduce the degree of uncertainty associated with buying older players while ensuring continuity \nof supply.  \nIn resource dependency terms, this development ruptured the traditional pattern of buyer-\nsupplier relations, as Irish clubs were no longer able to control access to Irish players. In other \nwords, the relationship changed from being one of buyer and seller to one where English \nclubs began to supply themselves. The result is that Irish clubs are no longer able to generate \nincome from the sale of promising players. Though this was traditionally rather small it \nnonetheless represented a valuable source of income for under-resourced clubs. At the very \nleast, it provided a form of compensation for the loss of valuable players.  \nThis drain of resources coincides with the declining competitiveness of domestic football \nin Ireland. Since the late-1970s Irish clubs (North and South) have repeatedly failed to get \npast the first round of European club competitions. Furthermore, only a handful of Irish-based \nplayers have been selected for their national sides since the 1980s, a trend that contrasts \nsharply with that of earlier decades. Indeed, the event is now so rare as to be virtually non-\nexistent. \nNevertheless, many of the teams in the Irish leagues contain players who failed to make it \nbeyond the trainee stage with English clubs. Irish domestic football gains from such return \nmigration because those who return have experience of full-time training with professional \ncoaches and established professionals. Additionally, the national teams (Northern Ireland and \nthe Republic of Ireland) benefit from having players training and competing at a significantly \n \n 19 \nhigher standard in the English leagues. Both of these are significant because they show that \nthe relationship between the Irish and English leagues still has dimensions that render it more \ncomplicated than a simple zero sum game in which one party always gains at the expense of \nthe other.\n12\n But if the relationship is to be characterised in these respects as one of dependent \ndevelopment it is also one in which the terms of dependency have changed. In the past Irish \nclubs looked to their English counterparts for large transfer fees. Now they look to the same \nclubs for young players who have failed to make the grade but are happy to return home and \nplay at a lower standard.\n13\n \nMeanwhile, Irish fans watch Irish players by travelling with Irish-based supporters\u2019 clubs \nto matches in English cities, or by watching live satellite TV broadcasts. Those in the Irish \nRepublic may even use the domestic TV channel for this purpose. This degree of exposure is \nsupplemented by extensive match coverage in the morning and evening newspapers. In sum, \nIrish football suffers similar contradictions to those of baseball and football in Latin America \n(Klein 1991; Arbena 1994). It has been penetrated and dominated by foreign employers and \nTV channels yet the overseas achievements of its players are a source of national pride. \n \n    Patrick McGovern \n    London School of Economics & Political Science \nNotes \n                     \n1\n I would like to thank Ellis Cashmore, Colin Mills, Leslie Sklair, the editor and three \nanonymous referees for their comments. The usual disclaimer applies. \n2\n Scottish clubs, notably Celtic and Rangers (Moorhouse 1986: 257), have also imported \nIrish footballers. However, the numbers involved have been relatively small by comparison.  \n3\n Bale\u2019s (1991: 198) study of the brawn drain included reference to the recruitment of \nyoung Irish athletes by leading U.S. athletics colleges (e.g., Villanova University). \n4\n Magee and Sugden (1998) have already conducted a micro-level analysis that uses semi-\nstructured interviews to examine the reasons why young Northern Irish footballers join \nEnglish clubs. \n5\n The vote of no confidence in the leadership abilities of the Football Association of \nIreland executive in 1996 is indicative of some of its failings (Sunday Tribune 10.3. 1996). \n6\n Irish clubs have occasionally imported players from England. However, this activity \n \n 20 \n                                                                \nhardly bears comparison with the scale or quality of Irish players who moved in the other \ndirection. Most of those hired by Irish teams have either been unable to make the grade in \nEngland or have already retired from English football (e.g., Bobby Charlton, Peter Lorimer). \n7\n It is also worth noting that English clubs were importing Irish footballers within a few \nyears of the foundation of the I.F.A. in 1880. John Peden, for example, was transferred from \nLinfield in Belfast to Newton Heath (now Manchester United) in 1893 (McGarrigle 1990: \n75). The practice of buying players was well established by 1910 when Mickey Hamill was \npurchased by Manchester United from Belfast Celtic in 1910 for \u00a3175 (McGarrigle 1990: 49). \n8\n Grimsby\u2019s offer of \u00a349.50 less \u00a310 for digs (with no fee) to a sixteen-year-old from \nColeraine is indicative of just how cheaply players can be procured (Irish Times 16.2.1999).  \n9\n Club size and divisional status are strongly, and positively, associated (Chi-square \n2570.4, df=6, p<.005; Gamma .947, p<.005). \n10\n I have not been able to address this hypothesis with wider evidence as the Rothman\u2019s \nYearbook only began to publish complete information on transfers after 1981. By this stage the \nnumber of Irish transfers had declined to the point where the evidence would still only have \nbeen based on a handful of scattered cases. It should also be noted that the highest fee to date \nfor an Irish player is \u00a3150,000 by Coventry City for Barry Prenderville from Cherry Orchard \n(Dublin) in 1995. This fee was itself the result of a UEFA ruling after Cherry Orchard took a \ncase against Coventry\u2019s decision to pay a nominal fee (World Soccer, February 1996). \n11\n This literature also finds that most of the players who sign from donor leagues do so on \nterms set by the foreign clubs. Anecdotal evidence from the biographies of Irish players, such \nas Paul McGrath (Dervan 1994) and Frank Stapleton (Stapleton 1991) would appear to support \nthis claim. \n12\n As Irish players earn significantly higher salaries in England their families (and local \ncommunities) may enjoy the benefits of significant remittances. Roy Keane, for example, was \nable to move his parents from a local authority house in Cork to a detached house in the \nsuburbs, shortly after joining Manchester United (Hannigan 1998: 45). \n13\n Waterford United, for instance, have recently stated that one of their key objectives is to \n\u2018provide football career opportunities for talented young Irish players, many of whom have \ngone to English clubs at the age of 15 or 16, only to be rejected a couple of years later.\u2019 (Irish \nTimes 2.9.1998). \n \n 21 \n                                                                \nBIBLIOGRAPHY \nArbena, J.
