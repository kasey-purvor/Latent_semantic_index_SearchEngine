INTRODUCTION\nSingle-nucleon knockout reactions, either with [1\u20134] or\nwithout [5\u20137] coincident gamma-ray detection, have now\nbeen the subject of numerous systematic studies. In particu-\nlar, since their first exploratory application to the phosphorus\nisotopes, in [1], single-nucleon knockout experiments with\ngamma-ray detection capability have been extensively tested\nand are being exploited to study the single-nucleon spectros-\ncopy of exotic light [4,8\u201313] and more medium-mass nuclei\n[14\u201316]. They are currently being used to study both the\nrelative and absolute single-nucleon spectroscopy of\nneutron- and proton-rich nuclei [10,14\u201317]. Recent reviews\nof the theoretical basis and the experimental status of such\nstudies can be found in Refs. [2,3,13].\nSingle-nucleon knockout reactions using intermediate-\nenergy exotic beams, and carried out in inverse kinematics,\nare fast, peripheral reactions. The residual nucleus, having\nlost one nucleon via the diffractive dissociation (elastic\nbreakup) or stripping (target absorption) mechanisms on a\nthick, light nuclear target, is then detected in the forward\ndirection with a velocity close to that of the particles of the\nincident beam. The technique has now been demonstrated to\nbe remarkably sensitive [3]. Analyses of these data using\neikonal few-body reaction theory have been shown to yield\nresults of good accuracy [7,18\u201320] and to offer formal, prac-\ntical, and quantitative advantages over alternative direct re-\naction approaches [13]. This is allowing the possibility to\nsystematically probe aspects of effective interaction theories\nand correlation effects on both neutron and proton orbitals\nunderlying the shell model.\nThe generalization of these techniques to two-nucleon\nknockout reactions and the magnitude of the associated cross\nsections are of interest for two reasons. The first is the po-\ntential to use two-nucleon knockout as a means for populat-\ning and identifying the ground and low-lying excited states\nof exotic, asymmetric nuclei. The second is the potential to\nuse the reaction, in addition, as a spectroscopic probe of\ntwo-nucleon correlations in such exotic systems and hence to\nassess modern nuclear structure calculations of these effects.\nIt has recently been proposed that two-proton removal reac-\ntions from nuclei on the neutron-rich side of the valley of\nstability, at high energy, do proceed as direct processes. The\nseparation energies and nucleon thresholds in such systems\nsuggest very strongly that direct two-proton removal will be\nthe only significant path to bound, Z\u22122 residue final states.\nCompelling experimental evidence was offered by both the\nmeasured inclusive cross section and the parallel momentum\ndistribution of the reaction residues in two-proton knockout\nfrom 28Mg [21].\nUnlike single-nucleon transfer and knockout reaction\nspectroscopy, two-nucleon removal reaction theories do not\nfactorize naturally into a structural (spectroscopic) factor and\na dynamical single-particle cross section. The reaction dy-\nnamics and structure are now more intimately coupled and\nthe reaction amplitudes are, in general, a coherent linear su-\nperposition of many contributing two-nucleon configuration\nterms, e.g., [22]. In this paper we present an original, eikonal\nmodel scheme for the calculation of the stripping (inelastic\nbreakup) component of the two-nucleon removal reaction.\nThis approach is able to combine the two-nucleon spectro-\nscopic amplitudes from modern shell model calculations\nwith the appropriate generalization of few-body eikonal-\nbased reaction theory, as has been discussed extensively for\none-nucleon knockout [3,13].\nThe necessary formal developments are presented in Sec.\nII. In Sec. III the theoretical predictions of the model are\ncompared both with more approximate calculations and with\nthe results of new measurements of the two-proton knockout*Electronic address: j.tostevin@surrey.ac.uk\nPHYSICAL REVIEW C 70, 064602 (2004)\n0556-2813\/2004\/70(6)\/064602(9)\/$22.50 \u00a92004 The American Physical Society064602-1\nreaction from the neutron-rich nucleus 28Mg [21]. The two-\nnucleon spin-correlation selectivity of the reaction mecha-\nnism is considered in Sec. IV and a second application, to\ntwo-neutron knockout from three neutron-deficient nuclei, is\nconsidered briefly in Sec. V.\nII. FORMALISM\nHere we consider two-nucleon knockout from a second-\nary projectile beam at intermediate energy. We consider the\nprojectile as an antisymmetrized sA+2d-nucleon system and\ndenote its many-body wave function by CsA ,1 ,2d. We do\nnot enumerate explicitly all nucleon coordinates. Thus\nCsA ,1 ,2d represents the initial, sA+2d-nucleon (shell\nmodel) ground state of the nuclei of the beam. These are\nassumed to carry total angular momentum and isospin Ji and\nTi with projections Mi and ti. Following the (assumed sud-\nden) removal of two nucleons in a peripheral, high-speed\ncollision with the target, the final, antisymmetrized A-body\nresidual (or core) nucleus will, in general, be found in one of\na number of final states FsAd, with spin and isospin Jf, Tf\nand projections Mf, t f.\nA. Two-nucleon amplitudes\nQuite generally, the two removed nucleons, denoted 1 and\n2, must be assumed to be stripped from a set of one or more\nactive (and partially occupied) single-particle orbitals f j.\nThese have spherical (shell model) single-particle quantum\nnumbers ns,sdj ,m. The isospin and angular momentum cou-\nplings involved are summarized in Fig. 1, where the two\nactive, removed nucleons will be assumed to couple to an\nintermediate total angular momentum I ,m and total isospin\nT ,t.\nThe shell model two-nucleon overlap functions of these\ntwo nucleons in the projectile ground state, relative to a\nspecified residue or core state f , is then a coherent sum over\nall the possible contributing two-particle configurations, as\nCJiMi\nsfd s1,2d ; kFJfMfsAduCJiMisA,1,2dl\n= o\nIma\nCa\nJiJfIsImJfMfuJiMidff j1s1d ^ f j2s2dgIm,\ns1d\nwhere a;hn1,1j1 ,n2,2j2j denotes each of the available or-\nbital pairs which contribute.

So as not to complicate the\nnotation we will not yet show the isospin labels and coupling\nexplicitly. We will only finally include these into the formal-\nism for completeness. The Ca\nJiJfI in Eq. (1) are the signed\ntwo-nucleon amplitudes which carry the structure calculation\ndetails; in particular, the information on the parentage and\nphase of each of the participating two-nucleon configurations\nin the projectile ground state with respect to the final states f\nof the residue.\nB. Eikonal model of two-nucleon stripping\nWe will show, following [21], that two-nucleon removal\nreactions, from exotic nuclei having even a modest asymme-\ntry (isospin) with respect to stable species, are expected to\nproceed essentially as a direct reaction process. We will later\nexamine in detail the case of two-proton removal from 28Mg,\nonly two neutrons away from stable 26Mg, as a particular\nexample of this direct reaction mechanism. The direct, two-\nnucleon knockout reaction mechanism is thus expected to be\napplicable to studies of a large region of the nuclear chart.\nWe will calculate the dominant stripping contribution to\nthe two-nucleon removal cross section. This is the projectile\nground state average,\nsstr =\n1\n2Ji + 1\no\nMi\nE dbWkCJiMiuuS fu2s1 \u2212 uS1u2ds1 \u2212 uS2u2duCJiMil ,\ns3d\nand an integral over all projectile center-of-mass (c.m.) im-\npact parameters b. Here the Si are the eikonal S matrices [18]\nfor the scattering of the two nucleons (1,2) and of the A-body\nresidue f from the target. Each is a function of the impact\nparameter of that constituent. These Si will be assumed to be\nspin independent. This cross section expression reflects the\nstripping (inelastic breakup) mechanism in which the residue\ninteracts at most elastically with the target, survives the col-\nlision, and escapes to infinity; reflected by uS fu2. The two\nremoved nucleons interact inelastically with the target and\nare absorbed from the elastic channel; as described by their\nabsorption probabilities s1\u2212 uS1u2d and s1\u2212 uS2u2d.\nWe make a small number of quite reasonable, but simpli-\nfying approximations. We first assume that the residue-target\nS matrix is diagonal with respect to different final states f of\nthe residue, and that this diagonal interaction is the same as\nthat for the residue ground state sdenoted=Scd for all final\nstates f . This has been termed the spectator-core approxima-\ntion when used in single-nucleon knockout [23]. It assumes\nthat the amplitudes for dynamical excitation of the core dur-\ning the collision are small.\nWe also neglect explicit recoil effects associated with the\nheavy mass A residue. It follows that\nFIG. 1. Schematic of the angular momentum couplings used in\nthe description of the two-nucleon knockout reaction.\nTOSTEVIN et al.

As we also con-\nsider here only nucleon knockout from deeply bound single-\nparticle states, we do not calculate other possible contribu-\ntions to the two-nucleon removal cross section, and which\nwe assume are small. These involve diffraction dissociation\nprocesses in which one or both nucleons are dissociated from\nthe projectile by their elastic collisions with the target or, in\nthe case of one nucleon being dissociated, the second being\nabsorbed.\nHaving made the spectator-core and the no-recoil approxi-\nmation, the inclusive stripping cross section is then the inco-\nherent sum of the contributions from each residue final state\nand so, with J\u02c62= s2J+1d, is\nsstr = o\nf\nsstr\nsfd\n= o\nf\nFE dbW uScu2 1\nJ\u02c6i\n2oMi\nkCJiMi\nsfd us1 \u2212 uS1u2d\n3s1 \u2212 uS2u2duCJiMi\nsfd lG . s5d\nHere the bra-ket denotes integration over the spatial coordi-\nnates of the two removed nucleons, rW1 and rW2, and the inte-\ngration over all spin variables, denoted by\nkCJiMi\nsfd u fl uCJiMisfd l =E drW1E drW2kCJiMisfd u fl uCJiMisfd lsp. s6d\nSince all the particle-target S matrices are assumed spin\nindependent, we require only the spin average of the two-\nnucleon wave functions, that is,\n1\nJ\u02c6i\n2oMi\nkCJiMi\nsfd uCJiMi\nsfd lsp\n=\n1\nJ\u02c6i\n2 o\nMfMiImaI8m8a8\nCa8\nJiJfI8Ca\nJiJfI\n3sI8m8JfMfuJiMidsImJfMfuJiMid\n3kff j18s1d ^ f j28s2dgI8m8uff j1s1d ^ f j2s2dgImlsp.\ns7d\nUpon using Eqs.

APPLICATION TO TWO-PROTON KNOCKOUT\nFROM 28Mg\nIt has recently been proposed that two-proton removal\nfrom a neutron-rich system at high energy proceeds as a\ndirect reaction [21]. The evidence was offered by both the\nmeasured inclusive cross section of the 9Bes28Mg, 26NedX re-\naction and also by the parallel momentum distribution of the\nreaction residues. The energetics of the N=16 isotones,\nshown schematically in Fig. 2, also suggest strongly that\ndirect two-proton s\u22122pd removal is the only expected route\nto the observed bound 26Ne final states. Different approxima-\ntions to the treatment of the structure of 28Mg, within the\neikonal reaction theory, were also considered in Ref. [21].\nWe are now in a position to discuss and elaborate upon these.\nWe concentrate, however, on the quantitative description of\nthe integrated and partial knockout cross sections.\nSpecifically, we consider the knockout of two protons\nfrom 28Mg s0+d at 82.3 MeV\/nucleon incident energy and\nassume, consistent with data, that final states will be popu-\nlated with 26NesJpd residues in the 0+ ground state and the\n2+ s2.02 MeVd, 4+ s3.50 MeVd, and second 2+ s3.70 MeVd\nexcited states [21,24\u201326]. The theoretical excited state ener-\ngies from the shell model are in precise agreement with ex-\nperiment. The measured cross sections to the four final\nstates, sexptsJf\npd, are collected in Table I.\nThe S matrices in Eq. (14) are calculated from assumed\ncore and target one-body matter densities using the optical\nlimit of Glauber theory [13,27]. A Gaussian nucleon-nucleon\n(NN) effective interaction is assumed [11] with a range of\n0.5 fm. This calculates residue- and nucleon-target S matri-\nces and corresponding reaction cross sections in line with\nmeasurements in the 50\u2013100 MeV\/nucleon energy range,\ne.g., [28]. The strength of the interaction is determined, in\nthe usual way [29], by the free pp and np cross sections and\nthe real-to-imaginary ratios of the forward NN scattering am-\nplitudes, app and anp. The latter are, however, of no conse-\nquence for the calculation of the stripping term under discus-\nsion, which is determined by the uSiu2. Densities of the target\nand the core were also assumed to have Gaussian shapes\nFIG. 2. Energy diagram of the neutron-rich N=16 isotones\n28Mg, 27Na, and 26Ne, showing the single-neutron snd and proton\nspd separation energies for each nucleus. The diagram shows that\nnondirect population of the bound states of 26Ne, by one-proton\nremoval to excited 27Na followed by proton evaporation, would\ninvolve states high above the (much lower) neutron evaporation\nthreshold and so is expected to be negligible.\nTOSTEVIN et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 70, 064602 (2004)\n064602-4\nwith root mean squared (rms) matter radii of 2.36 for 9Be\nand 2.90 fm for 26Ne [30]. Extensive calculations for one-\nnucleon knockout have shown the detailed radial form of the\ndensity to be unimportant, e.g., [16].\nIn our complete calculations, the shell model dictates that\nthe removed protons are stripped from three active orbitals,\nthe 0d5\/2, 0d3\/2, and 1s1\/2 states. The corresponding spectro-\nscopic coefficients Ca\nJiJfI were calculated with the code\nOXBASH [31] in the sd-shell model space with the USD\nHamiltonian [32]. These are provided in the TNA (two-\nnucleon amplitude) output files from OXBASH. The relative\nphases of the amplitudes, which will be presented explicitly\nin Table II for 28Mg, are based on radial wave functions uj,\nthat are positive near the origin, assuming the s,sdj angular\nmomentum coupling scheme. All radial wave functions are\nreal, and do not contain an i, factor used by some authors.\nWhenever needed, these single-particle wave functions\nuj,srd are calculated in a Woods-Saxon potential well with\nconventional radius and diffuseness parameters, r0=1.25 fm\nand a=0.70 fm, respectively. The strength of the binding po-\ntential is adjusted to reproduce the physical separation en-\nergy. The experimental two proton separation energy is S2p\n=30.03 MeV. No spin-orbit potential is included and thus the\n0d5\/2 and 0d3\/2 states are identical. Also, due to the large\nseparation energy, we have not included the small correc-\ntions to the nucleon separation energies for the energy dif-\nferences of the excited final states.\nA. Role of correlations\nIn addition to the fully correlated scheme developed in\nthis paper, we will consider briefly the following, more ap-\nproximate, prescriptions discussed in [21]. These were as\nfollows. (1) To consider that the four valence protons in\n28Mg are restricted to a f0d5\/2g4 subshell configuration, but\nthat they are otherwise uncorrelated. (2) To consider the rela-\ntive strength of the final state populations, Srel, based on the\ncomponents of the full shell model wave functions with the\ntwo nucleons having spin S=0 and an s state of relative\nmotion: as would be sampled, for instance, in the sp , td and\ns3He,nd two-nucleon transfer vertices [33]. Here we will ex-\ntend the latter to calculate exactly, and absolutely, that part of\nthe two-nucleon stripping cross section arising from configu-\nrations with S=0 and T=1. In this way we can obtain a\nmeasure of the extent to which both spin-singlet and spin-\ntriplet pairs are sampled within the knockout mechanism.\nB. Uncorrelated stripping\nIf the two removed nucleons are assumed to be uncorre-\nlated, other than being bound to the same center, then the\ncross section for removal of the nucleons from the pair of\norbitals ,1 and ,2 is, neglecting spin-orbit interactions,\ns,1,2 =E dbW uScu2 p\ni=1,2\n1\n2,i + 1\no\nmi\nk,imius1 \u2212 uSiu2du,imil .\ns16d\nAssuming therefore that the valence proton structure in 28Mg\nis f0d5\/2g4, several results follow. The first is that the calcu-\nlated (unit) cross section for removal of a f0d5\/2g2 pair is,\ngiven the model parameters, s22=0.29 mb. This sets the\nscale for the anticipated cross section. Based on an assumed\nf0d5\/2gn ground state (with n=4 for 28Mg) this predicts an\nintegrated cross section of nsn\u22121ds22\/2, or 1.8 mb, in rea-\nsonable agreement with the measured inclusive value of\n1.50s10d mb in Table I. However, it also follows in this un-\ncorrelated limit that this cross section yield [and associated\nspectroscopic strength SuncsJf\npd], for removal of a pair from a\n0+, fjgn occupied subshell, will be spread between final states\nJf\np\n, determined by the corresponding coefficients of frac-\ntional parentage (sjn\u22122dvJf , sj2dJf u sjnd0) where v is the se-\nniority of the state.

This yields Suncs0+d=4\/3,\nSuncs2+d=5\/3, and Suncs4+d=3, with oJfSuncsJf\npd=6 in our\n28Mg case, shown in Table I. This distribution fails to repro-\nduce the pattern of the measured 26Ne partial cross sections.\nWhen multiplied by the unit cross section they overestimate\nboth the expected ss2+d and ss4+d cross sections in compari-\nson with the measured ss0+d. Clearly the low measured cross\nsection yield to the two 2+ states presents a particular prob-\nlem for this very simple model. Already at this level, these\nresults suggest that the data are expected to reflect the pres-\nence of correlation effects.\nIt is clear from the two-nucleon knockout formalism of\nSec. II that there is no longer a separation of the theoretical\ncross section into a structure (spectroscopic) factor and a unit\ncross section. It is nevertheless useful in comparing between\ncalculations and data to think of cross section ratios as effec-\ntive spectroscopic factors. It is useful in the case of 28Mg to\npresent these effective spectroscopic factors as the ratio of\nthe theoretical and\/or experimental cross sections to the unit\n(uncorrelated) pair cross section, s22=0.29 mb. The experi-\nmental and theoretical spectroscopic factors Sexpt and Sth\nlisted in Table I have been calculated in this way.\nC. Fully correlated calculations\nCalculations with the fully correlated proton wave func-\ntions (using the formalism described in Sec. II) are shown as\nsth (in mb) in Table I. The shell model amplitudes Ca\nJiJfI used\nin these calculations are collected in Table II. There is good\nagreement of the partial cross sections sth, and hence trivi-\nally of the theoretical spectroscopic factors Sth, with the cor-\nresponding experimental values. The calculated inclusive\ncross section to the four bound states is now 1.43 mb, also in\ngood agreement with the measured inclusive cross section of\n1.50s10d mb [21]. It should be emphasized that there is no\nscaling or renormalization of these cross sections, which are\ncalculated in an absolute sense. It is also clear that in this\n28Mg case, a significant fraction of the integrated cross sec-\ntion expected, based on the f0d5\/2g4 uncorrelated estimate,\n1.8 mb, is accounted for in the measurements to the four\n26Ne bound states, with oJfSthsJf\npd=4.94.\nIV. PAIR CORRELATIONS\nHaving performed our complete, fully correlated calcula-\ntions, this section considers the importance of specific spin\ncorrelations of the removed proton pair. These consider-\nations, focussing on the spin-singlet knockout contribution,\nare facilitated by expanding the two-nucleon shell model\nwave functions of Eq. (2) in the LS representation. So, with\nthe nucleon spin s=1\/2 and f,j\nm srWd=uj,srdY,msrW\u02c6d understood,\nand showing the isospin explicitly,\nff j1s1d ^ f j2s2dgIm\nTt\n= Daj\u02c61j\u02c62 o\nLSLSm1m2\nL\u02c6 S\u02c6 s,1m1,2m2uLLdsLLSSuImdXSSs1,2dxTts1,2d\n3 ff,1j1\nm1 s1df,2j2\nm2 s2d \u2212 s\u2212 dS+Tf,1j1\nm1 s2df,2j2\nm2 s1dg5,1 s j1,2 s j2\nL S I\n6 . s19d\nIt is clear that provided the S matrices are spin independent\nthen the stripping cross section will be an incoherent sum of\nthe contributions from the S=0 and S=1 spin components.\nA. Cluster removal approximations\nIt should be recalled that in the sT=1d-pair two-nucleon\ntransfer reactions, the dominant pieces of both the kn u 3Hel\nand kp u 3Hl projectile structure vertices preferentially select\ns2S+1d,J=\n1s0 spin-singlet, relative s-state pairs [33]. No such\nstructure selection rule operates in the inclusive pair absorp-\ntion (stripping) expression, Eq. (5). There are nevertheless\nsome less specific (spatial) correlations driven by the reac-\ntion mechanism. It is expected, for instance, that the fast\nperipheral reaction will favor those configurations in which\nthere are significant amplitudes for finding two nucleons on\nthe same side of the projectile. The extent to which the\nknockout mechanism probes features of the wave function\ndistinct from the singlet s-wave correlations of two-nucleon\ntransfer is therefore of significant interest.\nMotivated by this (historical) 1s0, T=1 transfer reaction\nselectivity, in [21] an estimate was made of these relative\nspectroscopic strengths using the methods of [34]. These are\nreproduced as SrelsJf\npd in Table III, normalized to Sexpts4+d.\nVery similar (approximate) strengths are achieved by an al-\nternative scheme, retaining the 1s0 component of each shell\nmodel two-proton configuration by constructing the linear\ncombination of amplitudes\nTOSTEVIN et al.

TWO-NEUTRON KNOCKOUT\nIt should be clear that the methods discussed here are\napplicable throughout the nuclear chart. However, as has\nbeen clarified, only in those cases where indirect paths for\ntwo-nucleon knockout to the final states are ineffective, will\nthe stripping term considered here be expected to provide a\nquantitative description of measured cross sections. Such a\nsituation also exists for two-neutron knockout from nuclei\nsituated on the neutron-deficient side of the line of stability.\nThe reaction thresholds in the case of 30S are shown in\nFig. 3. It is fully expected that the two-neutron knockout\nreaction would be direct in nature in this and similar cases.\nThe appropriate energy thresholds in the cases of the 34Ar\nand 26Si projectile systems are very similar. These three ex-\namples are calculated and presented in detail below to dis-\nplay more generally the sensitivity of the calculated cross\nsections to the shell model structure and spectroscopy.\nThe theoretical inputs are essentially the same as for the\nearlier Mg two-proton knockout case except that the two-\nneutron separation energies for the calculation of the single\nparticle states are now S2n=34.07, 34.28, and 32.34 MeV for\n26Si, 30S, and 34Ar, respectively. The rms matter radii of the\n(assumed Gaussian) A-body residues, for the calculation of\nthe S matrices, are 3.07, 3.17, and 3.26 fm. The calculations\nwere carried out at 70 MeV\/nucleon. To reveal some details\nof the structural sensitivity of our calculations, the fully cor-\nrelated stripping cross sections to the first eight shell model\nstates of each residue are presented in Table IV. It is under-\nstood, however, that in all three cases only the 01\n+ and 21\n+\nresidue final states are bound and so would be expected to be\npopulated in an experiment.\nTable IV shows the very significant extent to which cor-\nrelations, and the details of the two-nucleon amplitudes, af-\nfect the calculated Jf\np state cross sections. Examples of this\nare the relative magnitudes of the cross sections to the 01\n+ and\n02\n+ states in the different systems, and also the magnitudes of\nthe calculated cross sections to the 22\n+ and 23\n+ states between\nthe three different systems.\nThe simplest (uncorrelated) estimates for these systems\ncan also be carried out, as was discussed in Sec. III B. For\n30S, for example, assuming a f0d5\/2g6 ground state, then\noJfSuncsJf\npd=nsn\u22121d \/2=15, with spectroscopic factors\nSuncs0+d=1, Suncs2+d=5, and Suncs4+d=9. The corresponding\ncalculated unit cross section is now s22=0.162 mb, suggest-\ning an integrated cross section of order 153s22<2.43 mb,\nand that ss2+d<5ss0+d. As we see above, in 30S the calcu-\nlated bound-final-state cross sections are only sths01\n+d\n=0.27 mb and sths21\n+d=0.22 mb, with an expected inclusive\ncross section of only 0.50 mb, and with sths21+d<sths01+d.\nThis observation and the detailed analyses shown on Table\nIV confirm that the simple, uncorrelated nucleon-pair predic-\ntions will, in general, be rather poor and should be used with\nsome caution. Unlike for the earlier 28Mg example, here the\ntotal two-nucleon stripping strength is distributed over a\nlarge number of residue final state transitions, most of which\nare above the proton thresholds of the final states.\nVI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nA comprehensive scheme is presented for the calculation\nof the cross sections for two-nucleon knockout by the inelas-\nFIG. 3. The analog of Fig. 2 for the neutron-deficient 30,29,28S\nisotopes, showing the single-neutron snd and proton spd separation\nenergies for each nucleus. The diagram shows that nondirect two-\nneutron removal to bound states in 28S, by one-neutron removal to\nexcited 29S and then neutron evaporation, would involve states far\nabove the proton evaporation threshold and is expected to be\nnegligible.\nTABLE IV.

As an example of its application, we\nhave investigated in detail the direct two-proton knockout\nreaction from the neutron rich nucleus 28Mg. We have pre-\nsented the predictions of several approximations to the struc-\nture and reaction which neglect, to differing extents, the spa-\ntial and angular momentum correlations present in the full\ntwo-nucleon configuration set. The agreement of our most\ncomplete results, which use the full shell model two-nucleon\namplitudes, and the experimental data is good. There is a\nconsiderable improvement in our results compared to simple\nno-correlation or assumed cluster-correlated approximations.\nWe show also that the reaction is sensitive to two-proton\ncomponents in the wave function other than the S=0, T=1\nconfigurations probed in two-nucleon transfers, such as sp , td\nand s3He,nd. Our calculations provide considerable further\nevidence that the measured two-proton knockout from a\nneutron-rich nucleus occurs as a direct reaction, thus opening\nthe possibility of both producing and performing detailed\ntwo-nucleon spectroscopy on the most extreme of neutron-\nrich, or in the case of two-neutron knockout, proton-rich nu-\nclei. The technique offers considerable promise for interro-\ngation of two-body correlations within many-body\ncalculations in these regions.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the U.K. Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under Grant\nNo. GR\/M82141 and by the National Science Foundation\nunder Grants No. PHY-0110253, No. PHY-9875122, No.\nPHY-0244453, and No. PHY-0342281.\n[1] A.
