We present ground-based electromagnetic data\nfrom the MIRACLE and BEAR networks and satellite opti-\ncal observations from the UVI and PIXIE instruments on the\nPolar satellite of an omega band event over Northern Scandi-\nnavia on 26 June 1998, which occured close to the morning\nside edge of a substorm auroral bulge. Our analysis of the\ndata concentrates on one omega band period from 03:18\u2013\n03:27 UT, for which we use the method of characteristics\ncombined with an analysis of the UVI and PIXIE data to de-\nrive a time series of instantaneous, solely data-based distri-\nbutions of the mesoscale ionospheric electrodynamic param-\neters with a 1-min time resolution. In addition, the AMIE\nmethod is used to derive global Hall conductance patterns.\nOur results show that zonally alternating regions of enhanced\nionospheric conductances (\u201ctongues\u201d) up to \u223c60 S and low\nconductance regions are associated with the omega bands.\nThe tongues have a poleward extension of \u223c400 km from\ntheir base and a zonal extension of \u223c380 km. While they are\nmoving coherently eastward with a velocity of \u223c770 ms\u22121,\nthe structures are not strictly stationary. The current system\nof the omega band can be described as a superposition of\ntwo parts: one consists of anticlockwise rotating Hall cur-\nrents around the tongues, along with Pedersen currents, with\na negative divergence in their centers. The sign of this system\nis reversing in the low conductance areas. It causes the char-\nacteristic ground magnetic signature. The second part con-\nsists of zonally aligned current wedges of westward flowing\nHall currents and is mostly magnetically invisible below the\nionosphere. This system dominates the field-aligned current\n(FAC) pattern and causes alternating upward and downward\nFAC at the flanks of the tongues with maximum upward FAC\nof \u223c25\u00b5A m\u22122. The total FAC of \u223c2 MA are compara-\nble to the ones diverted inside a westward traveling surge.\nCorrespondence to: O. Amm\n(olaf.amm@fmi.fi)\nThroughout the event, the overwhelming part of the FAC are\nassociated with gradients of the ionospheric conductances,\nand 66\u201384% of the FAC are connected with ionospheric Hall\ncurrents.\nKey words. Ionosphere (auroral ionosphere; electric fields\nand currents) \u2013 Magnetospheric physics (current systems)\n1 Introduction\nAuroral omega bands are periodic, wave-like undulations of\nthe poleward boundary of the morning side diffuse aurora oc-\ncurring in the recovery phase of substorms. The name omega\nbands was originally chosen by Akasofu and Kimball (1964)\nwith respect to the dark areas between the poleward extend-\ning auroral waves or tongues, which resemble the form of\nthe inverted capital greek letter . The luminous tongues\ntend to be narrower and having larger latitudinal extent for\nmore intense substorms, and may occasionally develop into\nauroral torches which are narrow, finger-like auroral forms\nthat extend several degrees of latitude poleward from the au-\nroral oval (Akasofu, 1974). Inside the tongues, which are pri-\nmarily deformations of the diffuse auroral boundary, discrete\naurora can also be found, especially at the tongues\u2019 poleward\nboundary. Pulsating aurora has been observed inside torches.\nThe typical longitudinal, as well as latitudinal extent of the\ntongues, amounts to about 400\u2013500 km. Omega bands have\nbeen found to grow simultaneously over a longitudinal range\nof several magnetic local time (MLT) hours, and have also\nbeen observed simultaneously in both hemispheres (Mravlag\net al., 1991).\nThe auroral forms are drifting eastward with velocities\nranging between 400 and 2000 m\/s, with a tendency of in-\ncreasing drift speed with time. These velocities have been\nfound to agree closely with the localE\u00d7B vec drift velocity.\n326 O. Amm et al.: Mesoscale ionospheric electrodynamics of omega bands\nDuring their eastward drift, the shape of the auroral forms\nis essentially preserved, thus indicating a mostly stationary\nstructure in the frame of reference comoving with the forms.\nA ground magnetometer positioned below the periodic, sta-\ntionary and moving auroral omega bands measures Ps6 pul-\nsations, i.e. magnetic disturbances with periods of 5\u201340 min,\nand amplitudes that may vary from 10 to over 1000 nT. The\ncausal relation between the auroral and the magnetic phe-\nnomena was first pointed out by Saito (1978). The ground\nmagnetic pulsations are most prominent in the magnetic Y\n(eastward) component, in which the maxima are more pro-\nnounced than the minima. The maxima in Y occur between\nrespective minima and maxima in the Z (vertical downward)\ncomponent related to the same omega band, where the Z min-\nima are leading the Y maxima by a phase shift of approxi-\nmately 90\u25e6. In the X (northward) component, the pulsations\nare also often visible, but they are typically quite disturbed\ndue to the temporal variation of the substorm electrojet inten-\nsity during the recovery phase (e.g. Paschmann et al., 2003,\ntheir Fig. 6.23).\nTo explain the observed ground magnetic variations asso-\nciated with the omega bands, two basic types of ionospheric\ncurrent systems have been proposed: The first, here called\n\u201csystem 1\u201d, is a north-south oriented Cowling channel in\nwhich concentrated horizontal currents are flowing south-\nward (Kawasaki and Rostoker, 1979). They are fed by down-\nward flowing FAC on the poleward side and diverged by up-\nward flowing FAC on the equatorward side of the channel. In\nthis model, the electric field is assumed to be uniform, but the\nconductances are enhanced inside the Cowling channel. In\nthe alternative model of Gustafsson et al. (1981), here called\n\u201csystem 2\u201d, the conductances are assumed to be uniform, but\nthe electric field has a negative divergence in the center of the\nauroral tongues and a positive one in the dark areas between\nthem. Consequently, the ionospheric Pedersen currents are\nconverging or diverging in the tongues or in the dark areas,\nrespectively, leading to upward FACs inside the tongues and\ndownward FACs in the regions in between. Since for uni-\nform ionospheric conductances the combined magnetic ef-\nfect of Pedersen currents and FACs is invisible below the\nionosphere (e.g. Fukushima, 1976), the ground magnetic ef-\nfect is completely caused by the Hall currents which are cir-\nculating around the centers of the electric field divergences,\nanticlockwise inside the auroral tongues and clockwise in the\ndark auroral holes. Both current systems described are as-\nsumed to be comoving with the auroral form and have to be\nregarded as being superposed on the background westward\nelectrojet.\nWhile these initial models were composed from data of\nsingle latitudinal chains of magnetometers, later studies us-\ning combined two-dimensional data of the Scandinavian\nMagnetometer Array (SMA; Ku\u00a8ppers et al., 1979) and the\nSTARE radar (Greenwald et al., 1978) showed that the con-\nductances are clearly enhanced inside the omega bands with\nrespect to the surrounding regions, and after subtraction of\nthe background field, there is a radial electric field compo-\nnent pointing towards the tongues, thus indicating upward\nfield-aligned currents there (e.g. Andre\u00b4 and Baumjohann,\n1982; Opgenoorth et al., 1983a). These studies used a \u201ctrial\nand error\u201d (see Untiedt and Baumjohann, 1993) technique\nto modify the ionospheric electrodynamic parameters such\nthat they yield a sufficient correspondence with the measured\nground magnetic disturbance. The shortcomings of this tech-\nnique are that no information regarding the uniqueness of the\nsolution exists, and that it makes it necessary to comprise\nthe information of many time steps into one single, spatially\nlarge model distribution for a reference time step, assuming\nthat a stationary omega band structure is moving over the\nmeasurement network with a constant velocity. Therefore,\nthe models cannot reflect the temporal evolution of the struc-\ntures.\nLater observations of omega bands using data of the EIS-\nCAT incoherent scatter radar (Folkestad et al., 1983) and\nmodels composed therefrom, together with magnetometer\ndata showed that the steepness of the conductance gradients\nhas been somewhat underestimated by the models using the\n\u201ctrial and error\u201d method (Buchert et al., 1988, 1990; Lu\u00a8hr\nand Schlegel, 1994; Amm, 1996). The general geometry\nof these models is in good accordance with results from nu-\nmerical and theoretical ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling\nmodels (Janhunen and Huuskonen, 1993; Yamamoto et al.,\n1993, 1997). Their weakness is that the EISCAT radar can\nobserve the ionospheric parameters along a single line dur-\ning one integration time only, and therefore, like in the case\nof the \u201ctrial and error\u201d models, data from different time steps\nhad to be merged into a single model. Consequently, the full\nspatiotemporal evolution could not be resolved.\nUsing a decomposition into the curl-free and divergence-\nfree parts of the model current system, Amm (1996) showed\nthat the main geometry and ground magnetic effect of the\nomega bands is caused by a system 2-type current con-\nfiguration, but found a system 1-type northwest-southeast\naligned Cowling channel at the western flank of the omega\nband. While this result agrees with the models of Buchert\net al. (1988, 1990) (who, however, did not separate the two\nsystems spatially), other studies came to the conclusion that\nsystem 2 is dominating (Opgenoorth et al., 1983a; Lu\u00a8hr and\nSchlegel, 1994; Wild et al., 2000).\nIn this paper we derive, for the first time, instanta-\nneous distributions of ionospheric conductances, currents,\nand field-aligned currents in 1-min intervals over a whole\nperiod of an omega band, using data from the MIRACLE\nand BEAR ground-based networks, and the UVI and PIXIE\ninstruments on the Polar satellite (see Sect. 2) for an event\non 26 June 1998. The two-dimensional method of charac-\nteristics (see Sect. 3) is used to perform the combined data\nanalysis. The resulting time series of spatial distributions of\nthe ionospheric electrodynamic parameters allows us to de-\nscribe the full spatio-temporal evolution of the omega bands\nand to discuss important open questions, like the balance and\nthe closure of the field-aligned currents between the tongues\nand the (optically dark) areas in between them (Sect. 4).\nWe restrict the discussion of the omega bands in this pa-\nper to the mesoscale ionospheric electrodynamics related to\nO. Amm et al.: Mesoscale ionospheric electrodynamics of omega bands 327\nthese structures. We will not deal with, for example, particle\nsignatures or the magnetospheric counterparts and excitation\nmechanisms of the ionospheric structures. For a recent sum-\nmary of research related to omega bands which also covers\nthese topics, see Paschmann et al. (2003, their Sect. 6.3).\n2 Instrumentation and observations\nThe MIRACLE network of ground-based instruments\n(Syrja\u00a8suo et al., 1998) consists of the IMAGE magnetometer\nnetwork, the renewed STARE coherent scatter radar, which\nmeasures the ionospheric electric field, and several all-sky\ncameras which are not used in this study due to the north-\nern summer light conditions. For our event on 26 June 1998,\nin addition to IMAGE, data of the temporary, but very ex-\ntended BEAR magnetometer network (Korja et al., 2002)\nare available. These two networks together provide the most\ndense coverage of magnetometers that has existed in North-\nern Scandinavia as yet. Figure 1 shows the coverage of mag-\nnetometers (dots) and the field of view of the STARE radar\n(black frame).\nFrom remote sensing of the UV- and X-ray aurora, the\nUltraviolet Imager (UVI) and the Polar Ionospheric X-ray\nImaging Experiment (PIXIE) on board the Polar satellite can\nprovide instantaneous global maps of the precipitating elec-\ntrons.\nThe UVI instrument measures UV-emissions within the\nLyman-Birge-Hopfield (LBH) band (140\u2013180 nm), caused\nmainly by the precipitating electrons impact on N2. When\nproduced at altitudes below about 150 km, some of the LBH\nemissions will be absorbed by O2. The amount of absorp-\ntion is determined by the O2 Schumann-Runge absorption\ncontinuum, which peaks at the shorter wavelengths and de-\ncreases with longer wavelengths. The LBH emissions are\nthus divided into two bands: A shorter wavelength region\nof 140\u2013160 nm denoted LBHS, with significant loss due to\nO2 absorption, and another region between 160 and 180 nm,\nLBHL, with less loss. By taking the ratio between the in-\ntensities of the two LBH-bands, we can estimate the average\nprecipitating electron energy. As the longest wavelengths are\nhardly affected by O2 absorption, the LBHL emissions are\nfurther directly proportional to the incident auroral electron\nenergy flux. Using UVI measurements, we are thus able to\nperform a remote diagnostic of the precipitating electrons in\nthe energy range between approximately 0.1 and 20 keV. The\nspatial resolution of the UVI camera is nominally \u223c40 km\n(Torr et al., 1995), but wobbling of the despun platform on\nthe Polar satellite means the spatial resolution is degraded in\none direction to \u223c360 km. For more details, see Germany et\nal. (1997, 1998a, b).\nThe PIXIE camera measures bremsstrahlung in the en-\nergy range between approximately 2 and 22 keV (Imhof et\nal., 1995), produced by the interaction between precipitat-\ning electrons and the nuclei of atmospheric particles. There\nexists a well-established relationship between precipitating\nelectrons and the production of X-rays (Evans, 1955). From\nSTARE\nKIL\nSOR\nMAS\nMUO\nFig. 1. Location of the IMAGE and BEAR magnetometer stations\n(dots) in Northern Scandinavia, and the field of view of the STARE\nradar (black frame).\nthe derived PIXIE X-ray spectra, a four-parameter represen-\ntation of the precipitating electron energy spectra can be es-\ntimated, having an electron energy range of 5\u2013100 keV and\na spatial resolution of 600\u2013900 km (depending on Polar al-\ntitude). A detailed description of the procedure is given by\n\u00d8stgaard et al. (2000, 2001).\nThe upper panels of Fig. 2 show the X (northward,\nleft panel) and Y (eastward, right panel) magnetic distur-\nbance components in a conventional magnetogram represen-\ntation for three about meridionally aligned magnetometers\nin the northern mainland of Scandinavia (see Fig. 1), for\nthe whole substorm period during which our event occured.\nThe substorm was detected by the magnetometers at around\n01:40 UT, and after a number of intermediate intensifica-\ntions, the recovery phase lasted at least until \u223c04:30 UT.\nThe ground magnetic disturbance associated with the intense\nsubstorm amounts to more than 1000 nT. Between 03:00 UT\nand 03:30 UT, three omega bands passed over the magne-\ntometers, as indicated by the quasi-periodic pulsations in the\nY component (upper right panel). In order to justify the cat-\negorisation of our event as an omega band, in spite of the\nabsence of visual band optical data which were originally\nused to define these structures, we discuss the magnetome-\nter data of the station Kilpisja\u00a8rvi (KIL), located quite central\nin the southern field of view of STARE, in more detail in\nthe lower panel of Fig. 2. Strong Ps6 pulsations can be seen\nin the Y magnetic disturbance component, with more pro-\nnounced maxima as compared to the minima. Similar pul-\nsations are visible in the Z (vertical downward) component\nwith the minimum in Z leading the maximum in Y by about\n1 min. Also in the X component some pulsations are visible,\n328 O. Amm et al.: Mesoscale ionospheric electrodynamics of omega bands\nKIL X\nKIL Y\nKIL Z\n03:15\n03:15\n03:20\n03:20\n03:25\n03:25\n03:30\n03:30\ntime\nFig. 2. Upper panels: X (northward, left panel) and Y (eastward, right panel) components of the magnetic field disturbance at three merid-\nionally aligned IMAGE stations, for the whole substorm period during which the event analysed here took place; lower panel: X, Y, and Z\n(downward) components of the magnetic field disturbance measured at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi (KIL) on 26 June 1998; the vertical dashed lines enclose\nthe time interval studied in detail in this paper. In all panels, the dashed or dotted horizontal lines are the baselines for the respective magnetic\ndisturbance components.\nbut less clearly. Thus, we observe the typical signature of\nomega bands in a magnetogram as stated in Sect. 1. The ver-\ntical lines in the lower panel of Fig. 2 mark the time interval\nfrom 03:18\u201303:27 UT that we have chosen for detailed anal-\nysis in this study. As can be seen most easily from the Y\ncomponent, this interval corresponds almost exactly to one\nperiod of the Ps6 pulsation related to the omega band which\ncan be estimated to last \u223c8 min 30 s.\nIn Fig. 3, the spatio-temporal variation of the magnetic\nfield during our analysis interval has been represented by the\nequivalent current vectors just below the ionospheric plane\nJ eq,ion (e.g. Untiedt and Baumjohann, 1993). These vec-\ntors have been derived from the ground magnetic disturbance\nfield using the Spherical Elementary Current System (SECS)\nmethod (Amm and Viljanen, 1999). During this procedure,\nJ eq,ion is partly also derived on areas which are not in an\nO. Amm et al.: Mesoscale ionospheric electrodynamics of omega bands 329\nFig. 3. Ionospheric equivalent currents (vectors) and UVI emissions (colour plots) for our detailed analysis interval. Plots around full minutes\nare organised from left to right with proceeding time, and according to the available UVI image: LBHS filter: upper row; LBHL filter: lower\nrow; no UVI images: central row. The equivalent currents are averaged with respect to the UVI integration periods noted above each plot.\nimmediate vicinity of the ground magnetometers. The reli-\nability of this approach has been confirmed by Pulkkinen et\nal. (2003). Since J eq,ion inside the area shown in the fig-\nure also influences the magnetic field outside of it, all mag-\nnetic stations shown in Fig. 3 have been used. In addition,\nthe colour panels show the UVI measurements in the area\nof Northern Scandinavia. As the UVI camera operates al-\nternately with the LBHL and LBHS filters for this event,\nboth image types are alternating in the time series. For the\nfull minutes around which no UVI data are available, only\nJ eq,ion is shown. These data are arranged in three different\nrows such that time proceeds from left to right. When look-\ning at a series of LBHL and LBHS images it is important\nto keep in mind that the same ionospheric feature may ap-\npear somewhat different in them due to their different energy\nand absorption characteristics as explained above. While the\nground-based instruments have a time resolution of 20 s, the\nUVI integration time is 37 s for our event. In order to make\nthe presentation of J eq,ion and the UVI images most consis-\ntent, we have averaged J eq,ion over the UVI integration time\nperiods in Fig. 3.\nAlso J eq,ion shows the typical signature expected for\nomega bands: The substorm westward (equivalent) elec-\ntrojet with maximum current amplitudes of \u223c2 A\/m shows\na meandering behaviour such that around 03:23 UT when\nthe Z component minimum at KIL indicates that the cen-\ntral \u201ctongue\u201d of the omega band is above the station, J eq,ion\nexhibits an anticlockwise vorticity and vectors with larger\namplitudes (up to \u223c1.3 A\/m) shift polewards to \u223c71\u25e6 lati-\ntude. Oppositely, around 03:26 UT when the Z component\nmaximum indicates that the KIL magnetometer is located in\nthe regions between the tongues, a clockwise vorticity is ob-\nserved and the largest J eq,ion vectors are concentrated at the\nequatorward border of the area shown. As can most easily\nbe seen from the J eq,ion signature of the tongues, the equiva-\nlent current structure is moving eastward over the MIRACLE\narea. From this signature, the velocity can be estimated to\n\u223c770 m s\u22121, well in the typical range of omega bands.\nThe UVI camera on Polar observes an eastward mov-\ning form with enhanced intensities reaching about 2.5 kR at\nmost. This form intrudes to the southwestern edge of the\ndisplayed area at 03:20 UT, and covers the equatorial part of\n330 O. Amm et al.: Mesoscale ionospheric electrodynamics of omega bands\nFig. 4. Global UVI emissions in the morning sector. The MIRACLE area displayed in Fig. 3 is marked by the blue frames.\nthat area up to\u223c71\u25e6 latitude as a southwest-northeast aligned\nstrip at 03:24 UT. This feature is well aligned with the west-\nward flank of the tongue of the omega band as determined\nfrom J eq,ion, and in the LBHS image of 03:24 UT it also\ncovers its central part. Outside this intensification the UVI\nintensities are considerably smaller, particularly at the pole-\nward side of our area. As discussed above, the time steps\n03:18 UT and 03:26 UT correspond to about the same phase\nof the omega band evolution as judged from the magnetome-\nter data in Fig. 2. It is remarkable that structurally also the\nUVI images of these two time steps show similar features,\nexcept for some equatorward shift of the structure. As is to be\nexpected (e.g. Frey et al., 1999), the observed UVI signature\nis not exactly identical with the type of appearance typically\nseen in visual band optical data. Still, the eastward move-\nment of a tongue-like feature and the darker areas around it\nare clearly discernable.\nIn order to put our observations into a global context,\nFig. 4 shows UVI images of the whole morning side auro-\nral bulge. Again, LBHS and LBHL images are alternating.\nThe MIRACLE region on which J eq,ion is shown in Fig. 3 is\nmarked by a blue box. A clearly developed substorm auroral\nbulge is visible, with periodic tongue or finger-like poleward\nextensions which are drifting eastward, as they are character-\nistic for auroral omega bands or torches (e.g. Paschmann et\nal., 2003, their Sect. 6.3). The LBHS images generally show\na larger intensity of the radiation, indicating a mean energy\nof the precipitating particles in the range of \u223c2\u20135 keV (Ger-\nmany et al., 1998a). The undulations are strongest in the\n\u223c01:00\u201304:00 MLT sector. During the event studied here,\nMIRACLE is located at the morning side edge of the sub-\nstorm auroral bulge between \u223c05:00\u201306:00 MLT where the\namplitude of the mentioned undulations is decreasing, but\nthey are still present, as most clearly seen from Fig. 3.\nFigure 5 shows the time series of STARE observations\nof the ionospheric electric field E. These data have\nbeen obtained by an inverse distance interpolation of the\noriginal merged radar data, which have a resolution of\n\u223c20 km\u00d720 km, to the grid of our analysis. The electric\nfield is mainly directed southward as expected in the west-\nward electrojet domain, and its magnitudes vary from \u223c30\u2013\n75 mV\/m. In accordance with the models of Buchert et\nal. (1988, 1990) and Amm (1996), the largest electric fields\nare observed at the poleward edge of the omega structures.\nFrom 03:21\u201303:24 UT when the tongue of the omega band\nis moving over the measurement area according to our pre-\nvious discussion, a negative divergence of E is observed in-\nside this area. At 03:18 UT and 03:19 UT, in the eastern\npart of the STARE field of view, the electric field has a sub-\nstantial eastward component which causes a positive diver-\ngence ofE in this region. This electric field structure repeats,\nalthough less pronounced, at 03:26 UT and 03:27 UT, i.e.\nwhen the main part of the omega band tongue has passed the\nfield of view eastward. This is consistent with expected be-\nhaviour of the electric field westward of a tongue in the mod-\nels of Opgenoorth et al. (1983a) and Buchert et al. (1990).\nO. Amm et al.: Mesoscale ionospheric electrodynamics of omega bands 331\nFig. 5. Electric field measurements of the STARE radar.\nHowever, a westward electric field component of similar\nmagnitude eastward of the omega band as predicted by these\nmostly symmetrical models is not observed here.\nIt should be noted that the STARE radar may at times un-\nderestimate very large electric fields. However, as we ob-\nserve magnitudes of E up to 75 mV\/m, it is unlikely that a\nsignificant underestimation has happened in our case. Fur-\nther, if large electric fields were underestimated, this would\nmostly mean that the ionospheric conductance would be\noverestimated in areas of already very low conductances (see\nanalysis results in Sect. 4). We therefore conclude that a pos-\nsible effect of this kind is insignificant for our study.\n3 Analysis techniques\nTwo techniques to derive ionospheric conductances are used\nfor our analysis: the two-dimensional (2-D) method of char-\nacteristics and a technique to derive the conductances from\nthe UVI and PIXIE data. The method of characteristics (In-\nhester et al., 1992; Amm, 1995, 1998) combines spatial data\nof J eq,ion (Fig. 3) with data of E (Fig. 5) to solve a differen-\ntial equation for the Hall conductance 6H . For this, an esti-\nmate of the Hall to Pedersen conductance ratio \u03b1 is needed\nwhich we obtain here from the analysis of the UVI and PIXIE\ndata (see below). With the resulting 6H and the input data,\nthe true horizontal currents J and the field-aligned currents\nj|| can then be calculated. In contrast to the \u201ctrial and error\u201d\nmethod mentioned in Sect. 1, the method of characteristics is\na forward method, information on the uniqueness of the so-\nlution is available, and there is no need to extend the analysis\narea with respect to the area of instantaneous measurements\nof the input data.\nThe ionospheric Hall and Pedersen conductances can also\nbe derived from UVI and PIXIE data, using a computer code\ndeveloped by the University of Maryland. This code is based\non the TANGLE code (Vondrak and Baron, 1976; Vondrak\nand Robinson, 1985), and it models ionospheric conduc-\ntances by taking precipitating electron energy spectra as in-\nput. A detailed description of the code is provided by Aksnes\net al. (2002, 2004). By combining UVI and PIXIE data, we\ncan derive precipitating electron energy spectra within an en-\nergy range of \u223c0.1 and 100 keV, meaning that all electron\nenergies of importance for the conductances are included\n(\u00d8stgaard et al., 2001). The Pedersen conductivity peaks\naround 125 km. In this height region electrons in the range of\na few keV, well measured by the UVI camera, deposit their\nenergy (Rees, 1963). The Hall conductivities are largest be-\nlow 110 km, and are therefore due to more energetic elec-\ntrons of some tens of keV, well measured by PIXIE. In this\npaper, this technique is solely used to infer values of \u03b1 given\nas input for the method of characteristics.\n332 O. Amm et al.: Mesoscale ionospheric electrodynamics of omega bands\nIn a statistical sense, i.e. when averaging the results\nwith respect to the temporal (\u223c4.5 min) and spatial (\u223c600\u2013\n900 km) resolution of the PIXIE instrument, the ground-\nbased results agree reasonably well with the conductances\nobtained from the UVI\/PIXIE technique, as has recently been\nshown by Aksnes et al. (2004b). For this study of several\nsubstorm events, including the one analysed in detail in this\npaper, the one-dimensional version of the method of charac-\nteristics was used (Inhester et al., 1992; Sillanpa\u00a8a\u00a8, 2002).\nThis paper focuses on the discussion of the results of the\ntwo-dimensional method of characteristics for the period pre-\nsented in Sect. 2. The optical data is mainly used as a qual-\nitative background information, except for the calculation of\n\u03b1 as discussed above. For each time step in the analysis, the\n\u03b1 value obtained from the UVI\/PIXIE technique is assumed\nuniformly over the analysis area. Although Amm (1996)\nhas shown that a variable \u03b1 improves the modeling of an\nomega band, we decided to use a realistic \u03b1 value, but being\nbound to the coarse resolution of PIXIE rather than intro-\nducing spatially varying, but possibly unrealisitic models for\nthis parameter. Possible errors related to a wrongly assumed\n\u03b1 value have been discussed in detail by Amm (1995), using\na model of an omega band (see his Fig. 5b) and found it to\nbe marginal.\nThe AMIE procedure (Richmond and Kamide, 1988) is\none of the most commonly used methods for deriving iono-\nspheric electrodynamics. In contrast to the techniques men-\ntioned above, AMIE is an optimisation method, i.e. the de-\nsired electrodynamic parameters are optimised such that they\nare as consistent as possible with all available measurements,\nusing a least-square approach. This gives AMIE the flexi-\nbility to utilize many different data sets, and not every in-\nput data set has to cover the full analysis region, as it is re-\nquired for forward methods that are based on the solution of\nalgebraic or differential equations, like the method of char-\nacteristics. On the other hand, AMIE uses initial assump-\ntions on both ionospheric conductances usually taken from\nstatistically-based models and other statistical a priori infor-\nmation which reduces its ability to adequately represent sin-\ngle events in regions where the data coverage is sparse. Until\nnow, AMIE has only been available for global-scale analy-\nses.\n4 Analysis results and discussion\nThe results of the analysis with the 2-D method of character-\nistics and the AMIE method are displayed as time series in\nFig. 6. Note that the size of the analysis area for the method\nof characteristics changes within the time series: While for\n03:18\u201303:21 UT, the whole STARE field of view (cf. Fig. 5)\nis displayed, for 03:22\u201303:27 UT the eastern border of the\nanalysis area is set to 24\u25e6 longitude, as for these time steps\nsubstantial uncertainties in the solution were encountered at\nthe easternmost grid column at 26\u25e6 longitude. The values of\n\u03b1 that resulted from the UVI and PIXIE analysis and which\nare used for the calculation are 2.75 for 03:18\u201303:19 UT, 2.4\nfor 03:20\u201303:25 UT, and 2.3 for 03:26\u201303:27 UT. Figure 6a\nshows the resulting 6H distributions, the primary output of\nthe method of characteristics, as isocontour plots. A pole-\nward extending tongue-like region of enhanced 6H values,\nslightly tilted in the northwest-southeastern direction, is seen\nto move eastward over the analysis region from 03:19 UT\nto 03:25 UT. The maximum conductances inside the tongue\nare varying from \u223c40 to 60 S (Siemens) and are located\nmost poleward between 03:21 and 03:23 UT. Starting from\n03:26 UT, the maximum Hall conductances in the poleward\npart of the analysis area decrease, and the appearance of the\nconductance structure becomes more diffuse. At the flanks\non the moving tongue, regions with low 6H values below\n5 S are visible. Steep conductance gradients, particularly in\nthe longitudinal direction, are present between the tongues\nand the adjacent regions. The second area where enhanced\nconductances are observed with magnitudes comparable to\nthe maximum ones in the tongues is the equatorward border\nof our analysis area, the \u201cbase\u201d of the omega bands. The con-\nductance structure in this region does not follow the move-\nment of the tongues.\nThe resulting true ionospheric currents J (Fig. 6b) are\ngenerally pointing southwestward, as a consequence of the\nmostly southward electric field that generates southward\nPedersen and westward Hall currents. The maximum current\ndensity reaches over 4000 mA\/m in the area of the tongues\nof conductance enhancements around 03:23 UT. In response\nto the steep conductance gradients, similar steep gradients in\nzonal direction are also seen in J , except for in the area of\nthe base of the omega bands. The most obvious difference\nbetween the equivalent (Fig. 3) and the true currents is that\nthe latter do not show a meandering signature like the former\ndo, but are essentially disrupted when they encounter a low\nconductance area, and reappear again in the subsequent high\nconductance area.\nConsequently, this change in J needs to be moderated\nby upward (downward) field-aligned currents j|| (FAC) at\nthe westward (eastward) flank of the high conductance re-\ngions (Fig. 6c; crosses denote downward, squares upward\nFAC). Alternating, meridionally aligned (with a slight tilt\nin northwest-southeast direction) sheets of FAC are visi-\nble which are comoving with the conductance tongue struc-\ntures. The upward FAC vary in magnitude between \u223c15\u2013\n25\u00b5A m\u22122, while the downward FAC are on average smaller\nand mostly do not exceed 10\u00b5A m\u22122 (for a more detailed\ndiscussion on the FAC balance and current closure, see be-\nlow). These alternating FAC sheets, together with the hor-\nizontal currents, cause the characteristic meandering signa-\nture observed in J eq,ion. Note that some numerical diffusion\nmay be introduced when calculating the j|| as the horizontal\ndivergence of J .\nFor comparison, the global Hall conductance results of\nthe AMIE method are shown in Fig. 6d for three time steps\nwith 10 min intervals and a time resolution of 5 min. The\ncentral time step 03:20\u201303:25 UT falls into the period anal-\nysed in detail above, while the other time steps are just be-\nfore and after our main analysis period. The location of the\nO.

Amm et al.: Mesoscale ionospheric electrodynamics of omega bands\nFig. 6. Continued.\nMIRACLE network is marked by a blue rectangle similar to\nthat in Fig. 4. The inputs for this method are ground mag-\nnetic field data from 141 magnetometers (65 of which are\nlocated in the high-latitude Northern Hemisphere), the UVI\nand PIXIE data from the Polar satellite (where the UVI data\nhas been smoothed to the resolution of the PIXIE instrument,\nsee Sect. 2), and a priori information from the statistical con-\nductance model of Fuller-Rowell and Evans (1987), as well\nas from the Millstone Hill statistical convection model of\nFoster et al. (1986). Obviously, the temporal and spatial\nresolution of the AMIE method does not allow for a direct\ncomparison with the results of the method of characteris-\ntics. However, the following features are important in or-\nder to confirm our mesoscale results and to link them to the\nglobal situation. Also AMIE sees undulations in the conduc-\ntance structure at the poleward side of the substorm auroral\nbulge which are moving eastward, most discernably in the\n01:00\u201304:00 MLT sector. The maximum Hall conductance\nof \u223c35 S that results from AMIE in the MIRACLE region\nduring the 03:20\u201303:25 UT interval is in a reasonably similar\nrange compared to the results of the 2-D method of character-\nistics (Fig. 6a), if some averaging with respect to the coarser\nresolution of AMIE is considered. Additionally, the AMIE\nresults indicate that the overall global conductance level in-\nside the substorm bulge stays fairly unchanged over the time\ninterval that we analyse in detail.\nWhen comparing the 6H , J and j|| distributions shown\nin Fig. 6a\u2013c with those of earlier models, it needs to be\nO.

Moreover, all\ndetailed spatial models of omega bands mentioned in Sect. 1\nexplicitly or implicitly assume that the structures are station-\nary while moving over the instrument network used. Al-\nthough in the time series results of Fig. 6, we observe co-\nherently eastward moving structures, an exact stationarity is\nnot given. In spite of this, our resulting 6H distributions\nof the omega bands\u2019 tongues structurally agree in many re-\nspects with the EISCAT and magnetometer based models\nby Buchert et al. (1990) and Amm (1996): The enhanced\nconductance tongues are extending \u223c400 km poleward from\ntheir base, and the conductance maxima in the center of the\ntongues and in the base have about the same magnitude. At\nthe flanks of the tongues, steep conductance gradients are\npresent in both longitudinal directions and in poleward di-\nrection. Also, the longitudinal extent of the tongues, esti-\nmated to be \u223c380 km from the 03:21 UT plot at 70\u25e6 lati-\ntude, agrees well with \u223c450 km for the models mentioned.\n(Note that our estimate also agrees well with the value of\n\u223c390 km which one obtains from the omega band period and\nvelocity estimates based on the equivalent current patterns in\nSect. 2.) These values are, however, clearly smaller than the\n800 km given by Lu\u00a8hr and Schlegel (1994), while in the study\n336 O. Amm et al.: Mesoscale ionospheric electrodynamics of omega bands\nof Opgenoorth et al. (1983a) their extent is only \u223c200 km.\nThese differences indicate that omega bands may exist on\na range of different wavelengths. The most notable differ-\nence between our results and the previous models appears\nin the current system and is caused by the fact that we do\nnot observe a continuous strong eastward rotation of E at\nthe western flank of the tongues. Hence, in contrast to the\nmodels of Opgenoorth et al. (1983a), Buchert et al. (1990),\nand Amm (1996), we do not obtain a strong southward com-\nponent of J there, but the westward currents are diverted to\nupward flowing FAC. Within our event, a larger eastward ro-\ntation of E and correspondingly southward directed J are\nobserved only during the 03:18 and 03:27 UT time steps,\nbut these signatures appear to be non-stationary. On the\nfirst view our resulting current system (Fig. 6b and c) may\nbe described as a sequence of longitudinally aligned current\nwedges with westward to southwestward flowing horizontal\nionospheric currents. In the following, we will analyse some\nproperties of this current system in more detail.\nObviously, our resulting current system neither corre-\nsponds one-to-one with the \u201csystem 1\u201d by Kawasaki and\nRostoker (1979), which consists mainly of southward cur-\nrents, nor with \u201csystem 2\u201d by Gustafsson et al. (1981), which\nassumes uniform conductances. In order to analyse the rela-\ntive importance of the basic current system components, we\nperform a division of the total current system into three parts:\nA part which has divergences in the analysis region, but is\ncurl-free (subscript \u201ccf\u201d), a part which has curls in the analy-\nsis region, but is divergence-free (subscript \u201cdf\u201d), and a part\nthat has neither curls nor divergences inside the analysis area\n(subscript \u201clap\u201d). Note that such a subdivision can uniquely\nbe applied to any given vector field on a sphere. In Fig. 7 this\nsubdivision is separately performed for the Pedersen currents\nJP (left column) and the Hall currents JH (right column) for\nthe time step 03:23 UT. We have chosen this time step since\nthe major part of an enhanced conductance tongue is present\nin the eastern central part of the analysis area, and also the\nsteep conductance gradients at its western flank are well in-\nside this region (compare Fig. 6a). A similar analysis has\nbeen performed by Amm (1996) on the EISCAT and mag-\nnetometer based current system modeled in that study (his\nFig. 3). Our results can thus directly be compared with that\nfigure. Figures 7a and b show the current parts J P,lap and\nJH,lap, respectively. As in the analysis of Amm (1996), these\ncurrent systems represent the background westward electro-\njet with southward Pedersen and westward Hall currents. The\ndivergence-free current system is dominated by an anticlock-\nwise vortex of JH,df which is centered \u223c1\u25e6 equatorward of\nthe conductance maximum (Fig. 7d) and reaches a maximum\namplitude of \u223c1200 mA m\u22121 (note the different scales in\nFigs. 7a\u2013b and Figs. 7c\u2013f). This current system causes the\ncharacteristic ground magnetic effect of a positive Y compo-\nnent at the western flank of the conductance tongue, and a\nnegative one at its eastern flank. Its signature is partly op-\nposed by a clockwise vortex of JP,df (Fig. 7c) which is cen-\ntered westward of the conductance maximum, but is gener-\nally considerably weaker than JH,df . The curl-free current\nsystem which is magnetically invisible below the ionosphere\n(e.g. Fukushima, 1976) is also dominated by its Hall current\npart, JH,cf (Fig. 7f), which shows a negative divergence in\nthe region of the western flank of the conductance tongue.\nIts maximum current density is with \u223c1300 mA m\u22121 com-\nparable to the one of JH,df . JP,cf (Fig. 7e) is much weaker\nand exhibits a negative divergence closer to the center of the\nconductance tongue.\nThe contribution of system 2 is represented by the JP,cf\nand JH,df current systems, since if only system 2 was\npresent, JP=JP,cf and JH=JH,df would hold. As in the\ncase of Amm (1996), this current system produces the char-\nacteristic ground magnetic signature. Here it comprises\n\u223c50% of the non-background currents. The polarity of\nthis system changes during the time series as expected from\nthe changes in J eq,ion (Fig. 3): for example, at 03:18 UT,\nJH,df exhibits a clockwise vortex and JP,cf a positive di-\nvergence (not shown). The remaining part of the current sys-\ntem at 03:23 UT, however, shows a clear difference to the\nAmm (1996) results. There, a northwest-southeast aligned\nCowling channel, in accordance with system 1, was de-\ntected at the western flank of the tongue, as indicated by\nJP,df \u2016JH,df and JP,cf\u2248\u2212JH,cf . Both conditions are not\nfulfilled in Fig. 7. Instead, the current system of JP,df and\nJH,cf exhibits the signature of the western end of a westward\ncurrent wedge consisting of Hall currents. Thus, we con-\nclude that the current system at 03:23 UT can be described\nas a superposition of a system 2 type current and the west-\nward end of a westward Hall current wedge. Note that as\nJH,cf produces no ground magnetic effect, the latter part is\nlargely magnetically invisible on the ground.\nIn Fig. 8 we analyse the FAC distribution at 03:23 UT by\ndecomposing the total FAC (compare Fig. 6c) into\nj|| = 6P\u2207h \u00b7E +\u2207h6P \u00b7E +\u2207h6H \u00b7\n(\nz\u02c6\u00d7E) , (1)\nwhere the subscript h denotes the horizontal part of the nabla\noperator, and z\u02c6 is the unit vector in downward direction. The\nthree terms of the right-hand side of this equation are called\n\u201cterm 1\u201d to \u201cterm 3\u201d here. While term 1 is related to the di-\nvergence ofE, terms 2 and 3 are proportional to the gradients\nof the Pedersen and Hall conductance, respectively. Term 1\ncontributes to upward FAC in the area of the enhanced con-\nductance tongue of up to\u223c4\u00b5A m\u22122 magnitude. Both terms\nrelated to the conductance gradients exhibit upward FAC at\nthe western flank of the tongue, and some downward FAC are\npresent at the northeastern edge of the analysis area. How-\never, term 3, related to the gradients of the Hall currents,\nis with upward FAC amplitudes up to \u223c20\u00b5A m\u22122 by far\ndominating both other terms. This result underlines the im-\nportance of the conductance gradients for the resulting cur-\nrent system (as for uniform conductances only term 1 would\nbe non-zero), and the dominating role of the westward di-\nrected Hall current wedge for the FAC related to our event.\nNote that in some studies (e.g. Sofko et al., 1995), term 1\nhas been called \u201cmagnetospheric FAC\u201d while terms 2 and 3\nhave been named \u201cionospheric FAC\u201d, although it appears dif-\nficult to justify such a separation in terminology in a coupled\nO.

Decomposition of the total FAC density j|| at 03:23 UT into a term related to the divergences of the electric field (left panel), a term\nrelated to the gradients of the Pedersen conductance (middle panel), and a term related to the gradients of the Hall conductance (right panel);\ncrosses denote downward, squares upward currents; for more details see text.\nsystem. While in those studies terms 2 and 3 are usually ne-\nglected, they contribute more than 85% of the total FAC in\nour case at 03:23 UT.\nThe above result is further specified for the whole time\nseries of our analysis in Fig. 9. The dots show the part of\nthe total FAC that connect to Hall currents (|\u2207h\u00b7JH |) in per-\ncent (scale on the right side of the graph), integrated over\nthe analysis area. The remainder connects to ionospheric\nPedersen currents. Throughout the whole event, the FAC\npart connecting to Hall currents dominates with \u223c66\u201384%.\nThe crosses denote the absolute FAC (|j||,up|+|j||,down|) inte-\ngrated over the analysis area for each timestep (scale on the\nleft side of the graph). These total absolute FAC are vary-\ning from \u223c1.5 MA in the beginning and end of the analysed\nperiod to the maximum value of \u223c2.3 MA at 03:23 UT. We\nnote that these values are of a similar order of magnitude as\nthe total upward FAC diverted in a westward traveling surge,\nthe westward end of the substorm electrojet, as estimated to\n\u223c1 MA by Opgenoorth et al. (1983b) and \u223c2.5 MA by Gjer-\nloev and Hoffman (2002). This indicates that a significant\npart of the substorm electrojet in the morning sector is inter-\nmediately disrupted due to the zonally alternating high and\nlow conductance structures related to the omega bands in the\nmorning sector of the substorm auroral bulge. Generally, our\nresults are in good agreement with the finding of Lu (2000)\nthat the FAC connected to the Hall currents amounts to \u223c30\u2013\n50% of the total FAC, seen over the whole substorm bulge.\nAn interesting and open question that arises is how the\nFAC are balanced and how the current closure in the iono-\nsphere is established. A number of earlier papers assume\nexplicitly or implicitly that the upward and downward FAC\nassociated with omega bands are purely closed by zonally\nflowing ionospheric currents (e.g. Yamamoto et al., 1993;\nLu\u00a8hr and Schlegel, 1994). In this case one would expect that\nif the FAC are observed in a certain fixed region over which\nthe omega bands are moving in a zonal direction, they would\nbalance over one cycle of the omega bands, except for possi-\nble small deviations due to effects of partial non-stationarity.\nNote that for a common omega band model with a zonal sym-\nmetry, like the one of Lu\u00a8hr and Schlegel (1994, their Fig. 9),\nthis balance is also expected in any subrange of latitudes and\nis thus independent of the question of whether or not the\nobservations cover the full latitude range of the structures.\nFigure 10 shows the integrated upward and downward FAC\nfor each time step of our analysis (marked by crosses and\nsquares, respectively), and the integrated total FAC (marked\nby dots). Except for the time steps 03:18 UT, 03:26 UT and\n03:27 UT, the integrated total FAC are upward throughout\nour event. The upward FAC tend to become larger when\nthe conductance tongue is in the center of the analysis area,\nwith a maximum of \u223c1.9 MA at 03:23 UT, while the down-\nward FAC are simultaneously becoming smaller with a mim-\nimum of \u223c0.5 MA at 03:24 UT. (An exception is the time\nstep 03:22 UT, where part of the FAC structure appears to\nmove out of our analysis region in the poleward direction.)\nSummed up over the whole omega band cycle, an excess of\n\u223c4.6 MA of upward FAC exists, which is far too large to be\nexplained by any non-stationary effects, although our event\nsomewhat fades out after 03:25 UT. This can be seen from\nthe following rough estimate: The Hall conductance maxi-\nmum decreases from \u223c55 S at 02:35 UT and before to \u223c25 S\nat 03:27 UT. Since the FAC are dominated by the gradient\nof the Hall currents for our event as shown before, they are\nroughly proportional to the value of that maximum. If we\nwould scale the FAC at 03:26 and 03:27 UT with the ratio\nbetween 55 S and the respective FAC maximum at these time\nsteps, we would get an additional amount of \u223c1.2 MA of\ndownward FAC, much less than the calculated upward FAC\nexcess.\nThe excess upward FAC of \u223c4.6 MA should be compared\nwith the total of \u223c11.9 MA of upward FAC summed over our\nanalysis period, indicating that the excess of upward FAC\namounts to \u223c39%. If we include a correction with respect\nto the temporal development of the event as estimated above,\nstill the upward FAC excess amounts to \u223c3.4 MA or \u223c29%.\nTherefore we conclude that the FAC cannot be solely closed\nby zonally flowing ionospheric currents, but part of the up-\nward FAC inside our analysis region have to be connected\n338 O.

Integrated upward FAC (crosses), integrated downward\nFAC (squares), and integrated total FAC (dots) in A over the analy-\nsis region, as a function of time over the analysis interval.\nwith downward FAC outside of it by currents flowing in\nmeridional direction. Given the direction of E, these addi-\ntional downward FAC regions can only be located poleward\nof our analysis area. This is consistent with the fact that J\nshows an equatorward component at the poleward boundary\nof our analysis area throughout the event (Fig. 6b).\nIn addition, we have calculated the instantaneous FAC bal-\nance for a single omega band tongue within our analysis area.\nFor this we have chosen the time step 03:21 UT since both\nflanks of the conductance tongue that is centered at \u223c19\u25e6\nlongitude are well contained in our analysis region (Fig. 6a).\nWhen integrating, we neglect the FAC at the eastern bound-\nary at 24 and 26\u25e6 latitude, as they obviously belong to a pre-\nvious omega band tongue. The integration results in a total\nof 859 kA of upward FAC and 534 kA of downward FAC,\nunderlining the imbalance mentioned before.\nFigure 11 shows the Joule heating WJoule=6PE2 for the\ntime steps 03:18 UT and 03:23 UT. This definition of the\nJoule heating does not include possible effects of the neu-\ntral atmosphere (e.g. Fujii et al., 1999) which we cannot take\ninto account since no data about neutral winds are available\nfor our event. When comparing the Joule heating with the\nconductance structures of both time steps (Fig. 6a), it be-\ncomes obvious that both are following each other closely al-\nthough the Joule heating is quadratically dependent on the\nelectric field magnitude. This is due to the fact that |E| shows\nonly small gradients in poleward direction during our event.\nAt 03:23 UT, a maximum Joule heating of \u223c120 mW m\u22122\nis resulting at the poleward edge of the enhanced conduc-\ntance tongue, while at 03:18 UT the maximum Joule heat-\ning amounts only to \u223c35 mW m\u22122, close to the equatorward\nboundary of our analysis area. The total power of the Joule\nheating over the analysis region is \u223c10 GW at 03:23 UT.\nFor comparison, the maximum power consumption in Fin-\nland under extreme winter conditions was \u223c14 GW in Jan-\nuary 2003.\nWhen vortical structures are present in the equivalent cur-\nrents, as derived from the ground magnetic field disturbance,\nit is usual to take the Z component of the ground magnetic\nfield as a qualitative proxy for the FAC, where positive (neg-\native) Z components are indicating downward (upward) FAC\n(e.g. Kauristie et al., 2000). We conclude this section by us-\ning the quantitative time series results of the FAC related to\nour omega band event as an exemplary case to test this proxy.\nFigure 12 shows the Z component at the magnetometer sta-\ntion KIL (see Fig. 1; scale on the left side of the graph), to-\ngether with the FAC just above that station, as determined\nfrom the method of characteristics (see Fig. 6c; scale on the\nright side of the graph). The large trend of the two curves\nfollows each other fairly well, except for the beginning of the\nanalysis period (03:18\u201303:19 UT). However, no simple linear\nrelation can be established between the two quantities, and a\nshift of one minute exists between the minimum of Z and\nthe most intense upward FAC over KIL. As KIL is located\npoleward of the center of the background westward electro-\njet, a positive offset in Z exists which causes this magnetic\ndisturbance component to be positive throughout the interval\nunder study. We conclude that for this event, the proxy of Z\nis useful to roughly predict the zonal location of the strongest\nupward FAC, but any quantitative estimates would be subject\nto unpredictable errors.\nFinally, Fig. 13 schematically summarises the behaviour\nof the substorm westward electrojet in the presence of omega\nbands, as inferred from this study. Instead of meandering\nalong with the poleward boundary of the omega band tongues\n(left panel), as one could imagine from the structure of the\nequivalent currents (Fig. 3), a large part of the substorm elec-\ntrojet is intermittently interrupted by alternating sheets of up-\nward and downward currents, located at the western and east-\nern flanks of the omega bands\u2019 tongues, respectively. Only\nat the base of the omega bands, is a continuous westward\nelectrojet present.\nO. Amm et al.: Mesoscale ionospheric electrodynamics of omega bands 339\nFig. 11.

We have analysed these data using the 2-\nD method of characteristics, in combination with a method\nto derive ionospheric conductances from the UVI and PIXIE\ndata from the Polar satellite, which was used here to estimate\nthe Hall-to Pedersen conductance ratio. The results of this di-\nrect and solely data-based analysis allow us, for the first time\nto fully resolve the spatio-temporal evolution of an omega\nFig. 13. Schematic sketch of the resulting geometry of the sub-\nstorm electrojet current in the presence of omega bands. Areas with\ncrosses denote downward FAC, and areas with circular patterns up-\nward FAC.\nband over one full period with a 1-min time and \u223c50-km\nspatial resolution. In addition, the AMIE method has been\nused to derive global Hall conductance patterns.\nOur observations and analysis results can be summarized\nas follows:\n1. The basic properties of the omega bands analysed here\nagree with the findings of earlier studies. A meandering\nequivalent current structure moves eastward with a veloc-\nity of \u223c770 m s\u22121, causing magnetic Ps6 pulsations on the\nground with a period of \u223c8 min 30 s during the studied inter-\nval which are most clearly seen in the Y and Z disturbance\ncomponents. While no visual band optical observations are\navailable, the UVI images show an eastward moving inten-\nsification which is approximately aligned with the westward\n340 O. Amm et al.: Mesoscale ionospheric electrodynamics of omega bands\nflank of the region of anticlockwise vorticity of the equiva-\nlent currents.\n2. Except for the equatorward base region of the omega\nband, regions of large (up to\u223c60 S) and low (<5 S) Hall con-\nductance are zonally alternating. The enhanced conductance\n\u201ctongues\u201d extend \u223c400 km polewards from the base of the\nomega bands and have a longitudinal extension of \u223c380 km.\nSteep conductance gradients are present at the zonal and\npoleward edges of these regions. The conductances in the\nbase region are comparable to the ones in the tongues.\n3. The current system of the omega bands can be decom-\nposed into two parts: One part consists of divergence-free\nHall currents circulating anticlockwise around the enhanced\nconductance tongues and of almost radial Pedersen currents\nwhich divert to upward FAC of \u223c4\u00b5A m\u22122 in the center of\nthose tongues. This current system causes the characteris-\ntic ground magnetic signature and is equivalent to the one\nproposed by Gustafsson et al. (1981). Its sign reverses in-\nside the regions of low conductance. The second part mostly\nconsists of westward flowing curl-free Hall current wedges\nwhich divert into strong upward FAC of \u223c15\u201325\u00b5A m\u22122 at\nthe western flanks of the conductance tongues. Their feed-\ning downward FAC at the eastern flanks of the tongues show\nmagnitudes around \u223c10\u00b5A m\u22122. These currents are mag-\nnetically invisible below the ionosphere. Both current parts\nmentioned are about equally strong with maximum current\ndensities of \u223c1200 mA m\u22121 and are superposed to the back-\nground westward electrojet currents.\n4. For our event, an overwhelming part (e.g. >85% at\n03:23 UT) of the FAC is associated with gradients of the\nionospheric conductances, while the remaining part associ-\nated with divergences of the electric field is small. Between\n66\u201384% of the FAC is connected with ionospheric Hall cur-\nrents and controlled by the gradients of the Hall conductance.\nThe total absolute FAC varies between 1.5\u20132.3 MA and is\ncomparable to the one associated with a westward traveling\nsurge. As the upward and downward FAC are not balanced\nover one omega band period inside our analysis area, we con-\nclude that part of the upward FAC has to be fed by downward\nFAC located poleward of this area. Thus, the closing currents\nin the ionosphere are not flowing solely in zonal direction,\nbut have an (equatorward) meridional component.\n5. While the structures associated with the omega band are\nmoving coherently eastward, they are not strictly stationary.\n6. The Joule heating is strongest inside the enhanced con-\nductance tongues, where it reaches up to \u223c120 mW m\u22122.\n7. The Z magnetic disturbance component on the ground\ncan be used as a rough proxy to qualitatively locate the max-\nimum of the upward FAC for our event, but no quantitative\nrelation between the two parameters can be established.\nIn addition to the ionospheric point of view, the results of\nour study have an important impact on the investigation of\nthe ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling of omega bands. In\nparticular, our finding that zonally aligned wedges of west-\nward flowing Hall currents exist colocated with the conduc-\ntance tongues is significant in this respect. These wedges\ncarry a substantial amount of the total westward current and\ncause zonally alternating FAC which carry integrated cur-\nrents comparable to a WTS to and from the magnetosphere,\nand are thus dominating the total FAC pattern of the omega\nbands. Although this topic is beyond the scope of this paper,\nwe remark that such a situation might be compatible with\nthe suggestion by J\u00f8rgensen et al. (1999) of large-scale os-\ncillations of the inner edge of the tail current sheet. It would\nthus be of strong scientific interest to conduct a study like the\npresent one when a multi-satellite magnetospheric mission\nlike Cluster is located in an appropriate conjugate location\nwith the omega bands.\nAcknowledgements.
