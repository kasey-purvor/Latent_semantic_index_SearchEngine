In broad terms, the purpose of warranty is to establish liability in the event of a premature \nfailure of an item or the inability of the item to perform its intended function [1]. Product warranty has become \nincreasingly more important in consumer and commercial transactions, and is widely used to serve many \ndifferent purposes [2]. The US Congress has enacted several acts (UCC, Magnusson Moss Act, Tread Act, etc.) \nover the last 100 years. The European Union (EU) passed legislation requiring a two-year warranty for all \nproducts sold in Europe [3].  \nAnalysing warranty claims can provide manufacturers with useful information on their products, as \nwarranty claim data are collected from the field that reflects the real operating conditions and usage intensity. \nResearch on analysing warranty claims data has mainly been concentrated on dealing with  incomplete warranty \nclaims data ( see [4-6], for example) and developing improved techniques to model warranty claims data ( see \n[7-10], for example). After the field reliability of products has been estimated, warranty servicing cost analysis \nbecomes another topic that needs to be focused. In this area, optimising warranty policies under different cost \nsettings (see [11-13], for example), and selecting maintenance policies for given warranty policies are two main \nresearch focuses (see [14,15], for example). For more detailed information on warranty claims data analysis and \nwarranty servicing cost analysis, the reader is referred to  the review papers [3,16-20] and the three books \n[19,21,22].  \nHowever, our literature review shows that most of the existing research makes the following two \nassumptions: \n(i) failed products will be reported warranty, and \n(ii) claims reported  are due to product failures. \nThe above two assumptions do not necessarily hold and are associated with consumers\u2019 behaviours \ntowards warranty claims. \nOn Assumption (i), most of the research assumes that an absence of warranty claim is a \u2018no failure\u2019 \nsituation [2,5,23-26]. Only two publications, from the same authors, consider the cases where all of reported \nproducts are not failed (see [27,28], for example). Patankar and Mitra [27,28] consider consumer behaviour in \nexercising warranties and describe it with warranty execution functions. They assume that all consumers may \nnot exercise the warranty even if the product fails during the warranty period, or FBNR (failed be not reported).  \nFor Assumption (ii), most authors assume that reported claims are due to product failures. Little research \nconsiders situations where reported products might be due to misuse, other human factors, or even non-failed \nproducts. In this paper, all of such claims are called non-failed but reported (NFBR) claims. \nConsumers might also execute warranty claims after they have experienced a number of intermittent \nfailures. An item might stop working due to a fatal failure or an intermittent failure. A product with a fatal \nfailure will stop working until it is repaired. In practice, not all of failures are fatal; some are intermittent. An \nintermittent failure is the loss of some functions or performance characteristics of a product for a limited period \nof time until subsequent recovery of the function. In the case of intermittent failures, consumers may experience \n3 \n \na failure and restart the product (for example, computers) and it runs OK. When the product is taken to a service \nagent, the repairman might not experience this failure when the item is being detected. The claims due to \nintermittent failures can constitute a quite large proportion of the entire claim population, as the percentage of \nthe \u201cno-fault found\u201d (NFF) event can be as high as 50% of all failures in electronic products while intermittent \nfailure is one of the main causes of NFF [29]. An intermittent failure example can be as follows.  \nA global variable in an electronic product is read and rewritten over another global variable; a \nmiscalculation can then arise and lead to product failure. The users can therefore mistakenly believe that the \nproduct has failed and claim warranty, the product is then sent to a service agent. However, when the global \nvariables are reset, perhaps upon rebooting the computer, the product can return to normal function. \nAlthough intermittent failures are a main cause of failures, little research has been found to model their \nwarranty costs. \nIn this paper, we derive warranty costs for three situations: NFBR claims, FBNR phenomenon, and their \ncombination, and we assume two types of failures: fatal and intermittent failures. \nThe novelty of this work lies in:  \n\u2022 to our knowledge, it is the first paper modelling warranty claim cost due to NFBR claims; \n\u2022 it considers manufacturer\u2019s ability to rectify intermittent failures and assume such ability is increasing \nover time; and \n\u2022 warranty claims are usually considered for individual products. This paper assumes that a \nmanufacturer\u2019s ability to fix the cause of intermittent failures develops over a batch of products. \nThe paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses human factors in warranty claims. Section 3 \ndevelops three models considering both physical reliability and human factors for repairable products. Section 4 \noffers numerical examples to validate the models developed above. Section 5 concludes the findings. \n2. Human\u00a0factors\u00a0in\u00a0warranty\u00a0claims\u00a0\nIn this section, we discuss three factors that might cause warranty claims: non-failed but reported (NFBR), \nfailed but not reported (FBNR), and claims arising from intermittent failures. \n2.1 Non\u00adfailed\u00a0but\u00a0reported\u00a0(NFBR)\u00a0claims\u00a0\nThere are situations when consumers might claim warranty, although failures are not due to product \nreliability but due to human factors. Some examples are as follows. \n\u2022 Claims for failures due to misuse, damage, accident, neglect, or lack of care. For example, a consumer \nby accident poured water into a laptop computer, which makes the computer failed. The consumer then \nclaims warranty. If a product is damaged by human factors, consumer can be responsible for part of \nfees, for example, returning and shipping fee. \n\u2022 Fraudulent claims. Consumer might be driven by warranty or insurance claims, and replace multiple \nitems to repair one fault or resort to fraudulent reporting of a problem which never occurred. For \nexample, the AAA insurance stated \u2018\u2018At least 10 percent of all reported claims are fraudulent in some \nway, according to industry reports\u201d [29].  \n4 \n \n\u2022 Some other forms of such claims can arise due to various reasons such as complexity of products, lack \nof sufficient training on product usage or faulty operational manual, product users might not be able to \noperate the products correctly, all of which can cause the products unable to work properly. The users \ncan therefore mistakenly believe that the products have failed, and then claim warranty.  \nHere, we refer non-failed but reported claims (NFBR) to those claims that are purely due to human factors. \nIt differs from claims upon intermittent failures that can occur but cannot be verified, replicated at will, or \nattributed to a specific failure site, mode, and mechanism. It also differs from claims arising from fatal failures \nthat are due to products themselves but not human factors. \nResponses of the manufacturers to NFBR claims can be different: (1) some manufacturers might even \ncease the warranty contract with consumers with NFBR claims, and (2) some manufacturers might not cease the \nwarranty contract, as it is not easy to judge if a NFBF claim is intentionally or unintentionally committed.  \nHowever, a common feature is that both can incur costs to the manufacturers, and therefore should be \nconsidered in estimating warranty claim cost. \n2.2 Failed\u00a0but\u00a0not\u00a0reported\u00a0(FBNR)\u00a0events\u00a0\nFailed items might not be reported warranty. This can happy due to various reasons, for example, \ntechnological advances cause some products (especially electronic products) to be updated frequently or become \nobsolete quickly. Although such items are protected by warranty contracts, their users might not bothered to \nclaim warranty for failed items, especially when failed items have been served for a quite long time and\/or they \nare not expensive. We call such a phenomenon as Failed But Not Reported (FBNR). Patankar and Mitra [27,28] \ninvestigate consumer behaviour when they do not execute the full execution of warranty. They listed a number \nof influencing factors such as costs of executing the warranty, the type of rebate plan, etc.  \nThere is a trend towards long-term warranties [20]. Rapid technological advances in many industries, \nespecially the electronics manufacturing industry, make products obsolete quicker than before, which requires \nproduct manufacturers to provide long-term warranties to protect consumers\u2019 profits. Long term warranty and \ncomplex products will make FBNR events occur more often than short term warranty. This presents an \nincentive to estimate warranty claims for the FBNR claims. \n2.3 Warranty\u00a0claims\u00a0arising\u00a0from\u00a0intermittent\u00a0failures\u00a0\nAs intermittent failures might involve more testing to find the causes of the failures, costs on intermittent \nfailures are different from those on fatal failures. Consumers might also claim warranty after intermittent \nfailures have occurred for several of times. The claim patterns upon intermittent failures are therefore different \nfrom those claims arising from fatal failures. Hence, it is vitally important to consider consumer behaviour in \nanalysing warranty claim data. For more discussion on intermittent failures or NFF, the reader is referred to \n[30,31] , in which the authors discuss the concept, causes and impact of the \u201ctrouble not identified\u201d phenomenon \nin the  electronics industry, but they did not develop mathematical models to estimate warranty claims cost. \nFrom a manufacturer\u2019s perspective, the ability to identify troubles arising from intermittent failures \ndevelops when more and more intermittent failures are investigated. It is reasonable to assume that the \n5 \n \nprobability of successfully detecting the causes of intermittent failures is increasing over time or over the \nnumber of claims. Such improvement might not affect the number of warranty claims as products have already \nbeen sold to consumers. The cost on repairing the intermittent failures, however, can decrease. \n2.4 Warranty\u00a0costs\u00a0due\u00a0to\u00a0human\u00a0factors\u00a0\nNormally, warranty cost incurs due to  \n\u2022 labour on diagnosing and repairing the failure; \n\u2022 parts\/materials used to repair the failed product; \n\u2022 shipping including shipping new parts for replacement and\/or failed products for repair. \nCosts incurred by the above three types, claims upon NFBR claims, FBNR events, and intermittent failures \ndiffer from those claim costs due to fatal failures.  \nFrom a manufacturer\u2019s perspective, costs due to NFBR might only include costs on reporting (for example, \ndelivering the non-failed products to their manufacturers), and cost due to FBNR might be zero as no report is \nconducted for a failed product. \nIn developing warranty claims models considering human factors such as NFBR and FBNR, an important \nrequirement is that we should be able to differentiate claims due to NFBR from those due to FBNR in the \nmodels. This is because we need to estimate the cost on claims due to NFBR and FBNR. \nThe impact of intermittent failures can be profound. Due to their characteristics, manufacturers may \nassume a cause(s) rather than spend the time and cost to determine a root-cause. This can result in increased \nmaintenance costs, decreased equipment availability, increased consumer inconvenience, reduced consumer \nconfidence, damaged company reputation, and in some cases potential safety hazards [29]. \nThe probability distributions of NFBR claims and FBNR events also have their own characteristic features. \nThe proportion of NFBR claims in the whole product population might decrease over time since the products \nhave entered service, whereas the proportion of FBNR events might increase over time. The NFBR for \nrepairable products might seldom occur after the products have failed and repaired once, because the users can \nbe assumed to have learnt how to operate the products from this failure and shall not make more mistakes of \nreporting non-failed products. It is therefore reasonable to assume that a consumer makes at most one NFBR \nclaim. \n3. Model\u00a0development\u00a0\nSuppose that the following general assumptions hold. \n(1) Two types of failures are considered: fatal and intermittent failures. Fatal failures require rectification to \nrestore the products to operational state, and intermittent failures do not require rectification action to \nmake it operational but need action to rectify the cause of such failures. The occurrences of fatal and \nintermittent failures are assumed to be statistically independent.  \n(2) Three types of claims are considered: claims upon fatal failures, claims upon intermittent failures, and \nclaims arising from NFBR events.  \n6 \n \n(3) Time on repair is negligible. Repairs on fatal failures are minimal, that is, a product with a fatal failure \nis restored to the state where it was exactly before it failed. If an intermittent failure of a product cannot \nbe verified, an identical product with the same age as the failed one will be used to replace it.  \n(4) An individual consumer makes at most one NFBR claim. Upon NFBR claims, only administration cost \nis incurred to the manufacturer.  \n(5) Only non-renewing warranty policy is considered.  \nIn the rest of this section, we consider warranty costs for three situations: NFBR claims, FBNR \nphenomenon, and their combination. In all of the three situations, we assume two types of failures: fatal and \nintermittent failures. \n3.1 Expected\u00a0cost\u00a0with\u00a0fatal\u00a0failure,\u00a0intermittent\u00a0failure,\u00a0and\u00a0NFBR\u00a0\u00a0\nThis section derives the expected warranty claim costs. \n3.1.1 Expected\u00a0cost\u00a0on\u00a0fatal\u00a0failures\u00a0\nBased on Assumption (3) above, time on repair is negligible and repairs on fatal failures are minimal. Then \nthe expected warranty cost with only fatal failures is given by \n\u0739\u0725\u0b35\u123a\u0753\u123b \u0d4c \u073f\u0b35 \u0db1 \u07e3\u0b35\u123a\u0750\u123b\u0740\u0750                                                                \u123a1\u123b\n\u0bea\n\u0b34\n \n3.1.2 Expected\u00a0cost\u00a0on\u00a0intermittent\u00a0failures\u00a0\nWe assume that  \n\u2022 every intermittent failure results in a warranty claim;  \n\u2022 the service agent can either detect the cause or not; and \n\u2022 once the cause of intermittent failures has been detected and fixed, failures due to this cause will not \noccur again. \nIt should be noted that a manufacturer might receive warranty claims due to intermittent failures reported by \ndifferent consumers, and then it tries to detect and fix the cause based on all of the claims. Hence, the \nmanufacturer\u2019s ability to detect and further fix the cause develops over their experience learnt from treating all \nof claims. For this reason, it might not be correct to assume that the ability to detect and fix the cause of \nintermittent failures simply depends on claims from a single product\/consumer. One should consider claims \nfrom all of the products sold. An alternative approach might be to assume that for an individual product, \nmanufacturer\u2019s ability to detect and further fix the cause develops over time.  \nAs such, we can consider the following two cases: the probability of successfully identifying and then \nrepairing intermittent failures depends on (1) the number of claims due to intermittent failures; and (2) time. \nIn case that the probability of successfully identifying and then repairing intermittent failures is dependent \non the number of claims, we can estimate the expected claim cost as follows.  \nAssume that n products are sold at the same date, and claims upon intermittent failures from all of the n \nproducts are reported according to a NHPP (nonhomogeneous Poisson process) or HPP (homogeneous Poisson \nprocess) with intensity function \u03bbn(t). For example, if intermittent failures of an individual product occur \n7 \n \naccording to a HPP with intensity function is \u07e30, then \u03bbn(t)=n\u07e3. Denote \u074c\u0b36\u0bdd (where \u074c\u0b36\u0bdd \u0d50 0 and \u0746 \u0d52 1) as the \nprobability that the cause at the jth warranty claim is not detected. Then the probability of the first success in \ndetecting the cause of the intermittent failures at the kth claim is \u0b36\u0732\u0bde \u0d4c \u123a1 \u0d46 \u074c\u0b36\u0bde\u123b \u220f \u074c\u0b36\u0bdd\u0bde\u0b3f\u0b35\u0bdd\u0b40\u0b35  with \u0747 \u0d50 1 (where \n\u0b36\u0732\u0b35 \u0d4c 1 and  \u2211 \u0b36\u0732\u0bde\u0bb6\u0bde\u0b40\u0b35 \u0d4c 1). Note that k failures to occur in [0, t) is given by the probability \u123e\u07c9\u123a\u0750\u123b\u123f\u0bde\/\u0747!, where \n\u07c9\u0be1\u123a\u0750\u123b \u0d4c \u05ec \u07e3\u0be1\u123a\u0751\u123b\u0740\u0751\n\u0be7\n\u0b34 .

(2) is the expected warranty claim cost if the cause of intermittent failures is detected \nand fixed within warranty period; it implies that the manufacturer fails to detect the cause of the intermittent \nfailures arising from the first k-1 claims but it is successful at the kth claim. The second term in Eq. (2) is the \nexpected warranty claim cost if detecting the cause of intermittent failures has not been successful during \nwarranty and it continues after warranty expires. \nRemarks. In some cases, detecting the cause of intermittent failures might start from the first claim and \nfrom then such effort might continue until the cause is eventually detected and fixed or a new model of products \nis launched to replace the old ones. In this case, the probability of successfully detecting and then fixing the \ncause depends on time, instead of the number of intermittent failures. If we can set the time when the n products \nwere sold to be 0, then the cumulative distribution function of time to the first failure (and then claim) is \n\u0728\u0b36\n\u123a\u0be1\u123b\u123a\u0750\u123b \u0d4c 1 \u0d46 \u123a1 \u0d46 \u0728\u0b36\u123a\u0750\u123b\u123b\u0be1.

Although such products might sometimes be protected by a long-term warranty contract, their \nconsumers might not claim warranty for failed products, especially when failed products have served for a quite \nlong time and\/or they are not expensive. In this section, we consider the situation when warranty claims are \npartially executed. \nUpon fatal failures, the willingness of consumers to claim warranty might diminish with time. The \nprobability of consumers being inclined to claim warranty for products due to a fatal failure is assumed to be \n)(1 tq , which is a decreasing function in time t. \nUpon intermittent failures, the following three human factors need consideration. \n\u2022 Consumers\u2019 willingness to claim warranty might diminish with time; \n9 \n \n\u2022 Manufacturer\u2019s capability to identify the causes of intermittent failures is improving with time.

However, when n> 30, the values of EC11(w), EC12(w), EC2(w), \nEC31(w), and EC32(w) change very slowly. It also shows that the expected warranty claim costs EC11(w) and \nEC12(w) are much larger than EC2(w), EC31(w), and EC32(w), which implies that the FBNR phenomenon takes \neffects.  \n    Figure 1 shows the values of EC32(w) against \u03b7, for the cases when n=5\u00a0and\u00a0n=25. It can be seen that EC32(w) \nincreases much faster for the case n=5 than that for the case n=25. It can also be seen that EC32(w)  reaches the \nsmallest value when \u03b7 =1. \u03b7 =1 implies that the cause of intermittent failures can be detected immediately. \n \nFigure 1: EC32(w) against \u03b7 and n \n4.2 Expected\u00a0costs\u00a0against\u00a0parameter\u00a0\u0897\u0adb\u00a0and\u00a0n\u00a0\nIf we change  q\u0b36 from 0.1 to 1 with a step 0.1, respectively, and keep the rest of the parameters unchanged \nas shown in Table 1, then we obtained the expected costs as shown in Table 3.  \nFigure 2 shows that the values of EC32(w) increase when q2 changes from 0.1 to 0.6, then they decrease \nwhen q2 becomes larger, say, when q2 changes from 0.6 to 1. It can also be seen that the values of EC2(w) are \nmuch larger in the case of n=5 than those where the case of n becomes larger.  \nThe findings about the relationship between parameter \u074d\u0b36 and EC2(w) is interesting. As one might expect, \nthe larger values of \u074d\u0b36 imply more reports arising from intermittent failures and therefore can incur larger cost \n12 \n \nto a manufacturer.

Conclusions\u00a0\nConventional research on warranty claims simply assumes that claims are only due to product failures and \nconsumers will report claims upon product failure, which might not be true in reality. This paper models the \nexpected warranty claim costs when consumer behaviour is taken into account for products protected by non-\nrenewing warranty policy. The numerical examples in the paper show the relationships between parameters and \nthe expected costs. The paper also shows that the expected claim costs are sensitive to the number of products \nsold. \nWith increasingly more accumulated warranty claim data, manufacturers should be able to develop more \naccurate warranty claim models to predict the expected cost and the expected number of claims. Such models \nshould also include more relevant factors, such as failed but not reported phenomenon and non-failed but \nreported claims, which might impact warranty claims. \nOur future research includes the following issues. \n\u2022 The probability of not detecting the cause of intermittent failures and the probability of failed but not \nreported phenomenon were assumed to be dependent on the number of claims. Possible extensions are \nto assume them to be associated with both product age and the number of intermittent failures reported. \n14 \n \n\u2022 In this paper, only one cause of intermittent failures was considered. More than one cause of \nintermittent failures should be studied.  \n\u2022 In the paper, when modelling the ability to detect the cause of intermittent failures, we assumed that \nproducts were sold at the same date. However, products shipped to retailers might not be sold at the \nsame date. There might be delays between shipment dates and sales dates, known as sales delay, which \nshould be considered in our future work. \n\u2022 The paper only considered repairable products with minimal repair. Further work should also analyse \nwarranty claims costs for non-repairable products or repairable products with different levels of \nmaintenance quality (see [33] for maintenance models, for example). \n\u2022 The paper only considered non-renewing warranty policy. Other warranty policy can also be \nconsidered. \nAcknowledgment\u00a0\nThe author would like to thank Professor DNP Murthy for the helpful discussion and his valuable \ncomments.
