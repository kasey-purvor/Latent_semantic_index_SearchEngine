How\ndid they understand the \u2018state\u2019 or \u2018condition\u2019 of\nEurope after twenty-six years of ideological and\nmilitary conflict? This article investigates how\nthe Shelleys, Byron and John Cam Hobhouse\nanalyse the European political situation in the\neighteen months immediately following\nWaterloo. In particular, it discusses how they\ninterpret European politics through use of the\nwords \u2018freedom\u2019 and \u2018liberty\u2019. Sometimes this\nlanguage of freedom constructs a transnational\nEuropean community, in which states are\nconnected by their shared commitment to \u2018free\u2019\ngovernment. Complicating this, however, the\ncircle also associate \u2018freedom\u2019 with ideas of state\nindependence; that is, a Europe divided into\nrival states independent from one another and\nnot necessarily unified by any common\ntradition. In this respect, the idea of \u2018freedom\u2019\nboth evokes and challenges notions of a\ncommon European identity. These different\nusages might appear to be straightforwardly\ncontradictory, but they can be connected,\nI want to suggest, using the argument of\nWilliam Hazlitt\u2019s essay \u2018On Patriotism\u2019\n(1814), which argues for a patriotic politics\nthat can legitimise transnational collective\nidentity.\nThe European Tradition\nof Freedom\nIn 1815 and 1816, the Shelley\u2013Byron circle\nproduced a number of texts which, directly and\nindirectly, reflect on the current \u2018state\u2019 of\nEuropean politics. This includes the third Canto\nof Childe Harold\u2019s Pilgrimage, which Byron\nwrote between May and September 1816 as he\ntravelled to Switzerland;1 Hobhouse\u2019s published\nwork on Napoleon\u2019s downfall, based on his\nexperiences in Paris in mid-1815; and the\nShelleys\u2019 writings immediately following\nWaterloo and on their own excursion to\nSwitzerland in 1816, particularly the History\nof a Six Weeks\u2019 Tour. These texts, as I suggest\nbelow, attempt to delineate a \u2018tradition of\nfreedom\u2019: a shared trajectory for European\ncountries which identifies both a common\nhistory and the prospect of future unity.\nIn doing this, however, they follow established\nlines of thought about the relationship between\n\u2018Europe\u2019 and \u2018freedom\u2019. In order to understand\nthe Shelley\u2013Byron circle\u2019s distinctive\ncontributions to this idea, I would first\nlike to note its common currency in\neighteenth-century works.\nMany eighteenth-century reference books\ndevote considerable space to defining and\noutlining a European tradition of \u2018free\u2019\ngovernment. For example, William Guthrie, a\nbest-selling historian and geographer whose\n122 Romanticism\nGeographical, Historical and Commercial\nGrammar (1770) ran to twenty-four editions\nby 1827, describes Europe as \u2018unrestrained\u2019 in\ncommerce, government and religion, especially\nwhen compared to the \u2018tyrannical\u2019 regimes of\nAsia.2 This difference between European and\nAsian governmental traditions is explained in\nterms of environmental factors: Guthrie\u2019s New\nSystem of Modern Geography (1792) suggests\nthat the spread of despotism is prevented in\nEurope by the varied land-surface forming\n\u2018natural barriers which check the progress of\nconquest\u2019. In Asian countries, the large extent\nof land makes despotism inevitable, since only\none individual ruling by force can keep the\ncountry in order. In Europe, however, \u2018the\nbarren rocks and mountains are more\nfavourable for exciting human industry and\ninvention, than the natural unsolicited\nluxuriancy of more fertile soils\u2019. For this\nreason, ancient Greece is where the human\nmind \u2018began to avail itself of its strength\u2019 and\nwhere European \u2018industry and invention\u2019\nbegan, because it is the most variable and\nbroken of territories. Greece\u2019s development\nepitomises Europe\u2019s: it is an exemplar of \u2018equity\nof laws and the freedom of political\nconstitution\u2019.3 Some eighteenth-century\nreference books even define the word \u2018Europe\u2019\nitself in terms of freedom. According to the\nanonymous Complete System of Geography\n(1747), as well as a large number of other\nsources, Europe \u2018is called [. . . ] \u201cAlfrank\u201d by the\nTurks; \u201cFrankoba\u201d by Georgians; and\n\u201cFrankistan\u201d by Asian peoples\u2019.4 This is\nparticularly interesting given that the word\n\u2018frank\u2019 has etymological associations with \u2018free\u2019\nand \u2018freedom\u2019: according to the OED, \u2018frank\u2019\ncan mean \u2018free in condition; not in serfdom or\nslavery\u2019; \u2018released from captivity\u2019; \u2018free from\nrestraint or impediment\u2019.5 Of course, it is not\nentirely clear whether non-Europeans\ngenuinely saw Europe as the \u2018land of the free\u2019,\nor whether this was how Europeans imagined\nthat others saw them.6 Nevertheless, the idea of\nEurope is being constructed through association\nwith \u2018freedom\u2019 and by contrast with the\ndecadent tyrannies of Asia.\nBy the early nineteenth century therefore,\nthe ideological association between Europe and\nfreedom had become well established. The\nauthor of the 1824 Supplement to the [. . . ]\nEncyclopaedia Britannica summarises these\ncurrent ideas by defining European liberty more\nprecisely. He speaks of the freedom to worship\nas one pleases, freedom to trade, freedom to\nformulate one\u2019s own laws, freedom from\ntyrannous government: advantages which are\nonly found, he claims, in European states. Most\nimportantly, he traces this European freedom\nthroughout history \u2013 from \u2018the freedom of\nGrecian states\u2019 to exist independently (prior to\nconquest by Macedon), to \u2018freedom of\ncommerce in modern day Britain\u2019.7 The\nSupplement uses this notion to construct a\nshared European historical development and\nidentity. In other words, the idea of political\nand commercial \u2018freedom\u2019 is what connects\nancient Greece, fifteenth and sixteenth-century\nItalian city-states and modern Britain together.\n\u2018Freedom\u2019 is what makes Renaissance Italy the\nsuccessor to ancient Greece and modern Britain\nthe heir of the Renaissance; and this \u2018freedom\u2019\ntherefore makes it meaningful to speak of a\n\u2018European\u2019 cultural tradition transmitted\nthrough different periods and societies. Indeed,\nfor the Supplement, \u2018freedom\u2019 drives the\ngradual development of ever-improving\ngovernmental systems and intellectual\nachievement in Europe.\nThe Shelley\u2013Byron Circle and European\nFreedom\nIn 1815\u201316 the Shelley\u2013Byron circle reinterpret\nthis \u2018libertarian tradition\u2019 to take account of\nrecent historical events \u2013 particularly the Allies\u2019\nvictory over Napoleon. In the History of a Six\nWeeks\u2019 Tour (1817), for example, Mary Shelley\nhopes that \u2018fellow feeling\u2019 for liberty can\nLiberty and Independence 123\nreform all European countries after the recent\nvictories of the monarchical powers:\nAll those of every nation in Europe who\nhave a fellow feeling with the oppressed [. . . ]\ncherish an unconquerable hope that the\ncause of liberty must at length prevail.8\nMary Shelley\u2019s use of \u2018liberty\u2019 has a\ndistinctly radical aspect: she employs the word\nto signify opposition to the \u2018hostile garrisons\u2019\nand \u2018detested dynasties\u2019 of monarchy. Instead,\nthe prospect of \u2018free\u2019 (that is, non-monarchical)\ngovernment can potentially reform the\nwar-torn remnants of Europe, uniting the\nseparate nations behind common governmental\nprinciples. In using \u2018liberty\u2019 to indicate desire\nfor reform, Mary Shelley is tapping into a\ndeveloping political vocabulary: as Michael\nRossington observes, \u2018 \u201cliberal\u201d in the sense of\n\u201cfavourable to constitutional change\u201d [was] a\nrecently-established English usage\u2019 which first\noccurred in the early nineteenth century.9\nFurthermore, the phrase \u2018fellow feeling\u2019 evokes\nMargaret Cohen and April Alliston\u2019s notion of\nthe \u2018sentimental community\u2019. For them,\npopular eighteenth- and nineteenth-century\ntexts by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Germaine de\nSta\u00ebl and others induce an \u2018emotional\nconnection that transcends nations\u2019 by\nappealing to a wide community of readers not\nlimited by national borders.10 Mary Shelley\ngives this concept a political dimension: she\nsuggests that \u2018fellow feeling\u2019 for liberty allows\none to comprehend Europe in terms of\ntransnational political principles, rather than as\nseparate national identities. In this way,\nEurope\u2019s past and future are defined by\n\u2018sympathy\u2019 for libertarian causes.\nByron, however, seems less optimistic about\nthe prospects for \u2018free\u2019 government. In Childe\nHarold III, he identifies a tradition of freedom\nunder threat:\nWhile Waterloo with Cannae\u2019s carnage vies\nMorat and Marathon twin names shall stand,\nThey were true Glory\u2019s stainless victories,\nWon by the unambitious heart and hand\nOf a proud, brotherly and civic band,\nAll unbright champions in no princely cause\nOf vice-entail\u2019d Corruption; they no land\nDoom\u2019d to bewail the blasphemy of laws\nMaking kings rights divine, by some\nDraconian clause. (608\u201316)\nIn this meditation on European history, the\ntradition of freedom is evident in the battles of\nMorat and Marathon, victories, according to\nJerome McGann, \u2018of men fighting for their\nliberty\u2019 (Byron, PW, ii. 307n). In more recent\ntimes, the French general Marceau\u2019s service in\nthe Revolutionary Wars contributed to the\ncause of liberty:\nHe was Freedom\u2019s champion, one of those,\nThe few in number, who had not o\u2019erstept\nThe charter to chastise which she bestows\n(549\u201351).\nFor Byron, as for Mary Shelley, Europe\u2019s\nachievements are defined by the liberty and\ncommon purpose associated with opposition to\nmonarchical power. But Childe Harold also\narticulates another tradition which seeks to\nlimit that freedom: the \u2018Draconian clause\u2019\nwhich resists the efforts of the \u2018civic band\u2019.\nEurope\u2019s history and future is thus based on\nconflict between advocates and opponents of\nfreedom. Caroline Franklin argues that Childe\nHarold is \u2018a profound elegy for the permanent\nloss of political freedom in the cycles or\n\u201crevolutions\u201d of European history\u2019. Byron\u2019s\npessimism, she says, \u2018deconstructed the Whigs\u2019\nand the radicals\u2019 view of history as progress\u2019.11\nIn fact, however, Byron understands European\nfreedom as a concept in flux, not just inexorable\ndecline. Although Waterloo appears to be a\nvictory for the \u2018Draconian clause\u2019, hope still\nexists:\nWe do not curse thee Waterloo!\nThough Freedom\u2019s blood thy plain bedew;\nThere \u2018twas shed, but is not sunk \u2013\nRising from each gory trunk,\n124 Romanticism\nLike the water-spout from ocean,\nWith a strong and growing motion \u2013\nIt soars and mingles in the air. (\u2018Ode (from\nthe French)\u2019, 1\u20137)12\nThe poem seems to suggest that cause of\nfreedom has been set back by Napoleon\u2019s\ndefeat. And yet Napoleon himself is described\nboth as \u2018Freedom\u2019s son\u2019 (27), and as a proud,\nmonarch, a hero who \u2018sank into a King\u2019\n(33) \u2013meaning that his downfall\nsimultaneously marks the defeat of both \u2018free\u2019\ngovernment and kingly arrogance. This\nambiguous presentation of Napoleon expresses\nuncertainty over Europe\u2019s direction: does\nNapoleon\u2019s deposition indicate a continuation\nof or a disruption in the tradition of freedom?\nAs the poem continues, the speaker strives to\nanswer this question, eventually claiming that\n\u2018Freedom rejoices\u2019 (73) because \u2018France hath\ntwice been too well taught \/ The \u2018moral lesson\u2019\nclearly bought \u2013 \/ Her safety sits not on a\nthrone [. . . ] \/ But in equal rights and laws\u2019\n(77\u201381). This freedom can be found, not in the\ncompetition of nations (Pouring nations\u2019 blood\nlike water, \/ In imperial seas of slaughter!\n[89\u201390]), but in European \u2018fellow feeling\u2019:\nwhere \u2018the heart and mind, \/ And the voice of\nmankind, \/ Shall arise in communion\u2019 (91\u20133).\nDespite the apparent victory of the Allied\nmonarchies, Waterloo ultimately confirms the\npotential development of European liberty.\nIn The Siege of Corinth (also published in\nearly 1816), Byron is similarly concerned for\nthe loss, and possible recovery, of freedom. The\nspeaker laments how \u2018Venice ceased to be \/ Her\nancient civic boast \u2013 \u201dthe Free\u201d\u2018 (84\u20135), before\ntracing the history (and future prospects) of\nthat \u2018freedom\u2019 back to Christianity and ancient\nGreece, now overrun with oriental despotism:\n\u201cTill Christian hands to Greece restore \/ The\nfreedom Venice gave of yore\u2019 (104\u20135). Like the\nSupplement to [. . . ] Britannica, the poem uses\n\u2018freedom\u2019 to connect different periods and\nlocations as part of a discernable tradition, but\nunlike the reference book, it also discusses\nmanifest threats to that freedom, mainly from\n\u2018the Moslem\u2019s sway\u2019 (107). The use of Venice is\nparticularly important here. Malcolm Kelsall\nsuggests that, for Byron, Venice was not only\n\u2018the meeting place of Occident and Orient in a\ndirect imperial and religious conflict\u2019, but also\nsignifies the \u2018transition of a former imperial\npower to colonial status\u2019, particularly after\nNapoleon conquered and abolished the\nVenetian Republic in 1797.13 In this respect,\nVenice represents the intricate constructions\nand tensions of European history: empire and\ncolony, Christianity and Islam, freedom and\ntyranny. Byron\u2019s awareness of these complex\ninteractions makes him cynical about\nunthinkingly optimistic ideas of progress, but\nthis scepticism does not, I would suggest, define\nhis conception of post-Napoleonic Europe and\nits potential for \u2018free\u2019 government.\nJohn Cam Hobhouse, Byron\u2019s friend and\ntravelling companion, also muses on the\ncomplexities of the libertarian tradition: \u2018it\ncannot be concealed, there is in the flight of\nNapoleon a precipitancy which nothing can\nescape; and we must sigh as Montesquieu did\nover the suicide of Brutus, to see the cause of\nliberty so easily abandoned\u2019.14 Hobhouse\nidentifies Napoleon with a tradition of freedom\nthat extends deep into history, beyond the\nphilosophes and back to the classical world. Like\nByron, though, he is preoccupied by the\nprospective failure of that tradition. Indeed,\nNapoleon seems to embody both the possibility\nof greater liberty and the disappointments of its\ndissipation. If here he is the banished emblem\nof freedom, later his presence, rather than his\nabsence, hinders liberty\u2019s progress: \u2018France\nwould have now been free had not Napoleon\ncome back\u2019 (Recollections, ii. 3). In Letters\nWritten During the Last Reign of the Emperor\nNapoleon (1816), Hobhouse elaborates further\non exactly what he means by \u2018freedom\u2019. He\nidentifies a \u2018proper\u2019 tradition of monarchy\nwhich should operate uniformly throughout\nLiberty and Independence 125\nEurope, but at present exists only in\nEngland \u2013where \u2018the rights of the citizen\u2019 are\nrespected and \u2018the desire of freedom has made\nthe capital [. . . ] affluent in money and men, so\ntheir wealth gave them the ability to defend\nand confirm their independence\u2019.15 Despite this\nstress on British \u2018independence\u2019, Hobhouse\nenvisages this as a European-wide ideal,\nproposing that all states should strive for this\ncondition. As an Empire, France had drawn\ncloser to this model system, for despite \u2018the\ntyranny of Napoleon\u2019, \u2018the circumstances of his\nelevation [. . . ] confirm the notions of the power\nof individual exertion, and the original equality\nof man\u2019 (Last Reign, i. 218). By contrast,\nCastlereagh\u2019s political objective \u2013 to restore\nthe \u2018ancient social system\u2019 of\nmonarchies \u2013 completely betrays the notion of\nEuropean liberty by supporting despotic\nregimes and refusing to acknowledge that other\nstates should be free to govern themselves\n(i. 222). There is an inconsistency here:\nHobhouse opposes Britain being \u2018the arbitress\nof Europe\u2019 (i. 225), but still upholds the British\ngovernmental system as the ideal model for the\nrealisation of European freedom. This leads him\ninto slightly self-contradictory territory,\narguing that both Britain and Napoleon\u2019s\nFrance alternately represent and prevent the\ndevelopment of liberty.\nHowever, the term \u2018freedom\u2019 is not merely\nused by radical thinkers like Mary Shelley,\nByron and Hobhouse. The conservative scholar\nT. H. Horne, writing in 1816, rejoices that\nNapoleon\u2019s downfall has \u2018gladdened the heart\nof every lover of freedom\u2019, since his usurpation\nwas an offence to Europe\u2019s ancient traditions.\nHe calls the Napoleonic Wars \u2018The Campaign of\nthe Liberties of Europe\u2019, suggesting that a \u2018free\u2019\nEurope is one which replicates the pre-1789\nstatus quo.16 Castlereagh himself even employs\nthis terminology to justify British government\npolicy: \u2018the powers of Europe\u2019, he says, treating\nthe sub-continent as a totality, \u2018have been\ncompelled, in vindication of their own liberties,\nand for the settlement of the world, to invade\nFrance\u2019.17 This language recalls William\nRobertson\u2019s use of \u2018liberty\u2019 in the 1760s. In his\nView of the Progress of Society in Europe,\nRobertson refers to the balance of power in\nterms of liberty: \u2018the method of preventing any\nmonarch from rising to such a degree of power,\nas was inconsistent with the general liberty\u2019.18\nThis associates the word with \u2018stability\u2019, a usage\nwhich contrasts with liberal and radical writers\nwho employ \u2018freedom\u2019 and \u2018liberty\u2019 to refer to\nchanges in governmental organisation. For the\nanti-establishment political writer George\nEnsor, whose On the State of Europe appeared\nin 1816, \u2018free nations\u2019 are to be contrasted with\n\u2018the abyss of monarchy\u2019. Alluding to the\nprecedent of ancient Athens, he asserts that\nmonarchy, not Revolutionary France, is an\naberration from the proper order of things.19\nThese writers base their understandings of\nEuropean history and futurity upon different\nnotions of freedom, using various\ninterpretations of the libertarian tradition to\nanalyse contemporary politics and to construct\nteleologies of what Europe should be like, based\non a conception of its \u2018free\u2019 past.\nPercy Shelley, however, directly challenges\nthe concept of a free tradition particular to\nEuropean states. In a fragment known to\neditors as \u2018The Elysian Fields\u2019 and written\neither in 1815 or 1816, the speaker says that:\nthe English nation does not, as has been\nimagined, inherit freedom from its ancestors.\nPublic opinion rather than private institution\nmaintains it in whatever portion it may now\npossess [. . . ] As yet the gradation [by] which\nthis freedom has advanced has been\ncontested step by step.20\nThese sentences make \u2018freedom\u2019 iconoclastic,\nopposed to institutions and continually\nre-imagined by each generation, not passed on\nin an identifiable tradition or progression.\nMoreover, because Shelley emphasises both the\n126 Romanticism\nEnglishness and the locality of the \u2018public\nopinion\u2019 which defines this freedom, his\nsuggestions stand against the more general\n\u2018European liberty\u2019 identified by Byron and\nHobhouse, which extends from ancient Greece\nto the Revolution as part of abstract tradition.\nThis idea treats freedom as a progress theory,\nsometimes hindered, but gradually developing\nin a single direction. Instead, Shelley\nemphasises the multiplicity of possible futures:\nhow a momentary popular reassessment of\nfreedom, disconnected from previous\ninterpretations, can abruptly change society, or\nliterally free it from its past.\nLiberty and the State\nof Independence\n\u2018Liberty\u2019, then, often evokes a common\nEuropean ideal \u2013 a notion of how Europe can be\nshaped through the alleged liberation of the\nRevolution or (for conservative writers) the\nfreedoms of the \u2018ancient social system\u2019.\nHowever, liberty is also associated with ideas of\nstate independence: that is, a Europe divided\ninto rival national blocs with no shared\ntradition. Byron\u2019s friend James Wedderburne\nWebster employs \u2018freedom\u2019 in a strictly\npatriotic context in his poem \u2018Waterloo\u2019 (1816),\nasserting the supremacy of England over its\nenemies: Wellington\u2019s victory \u2018Hath swell\u2019d his\nCountry\u2019s Harp of fame\u2019 and subdued French\ntyranny by protecting \u2018the free\u2019.21 The struggle\nfor freedom and the struggle for state\nself-assertion are thus connected. Mary Shelley\nmakes a similar point when she observes that\nthe Swiss could \u2018make a brave defence against\nany invader of their freedom\u2019. In other words,\nthey can best defend their liberty by preserving\nindependence and self-government (Six Weeks\u2019\nTour, 50).\nHobhouse also connects liberty with\nindependence by calling the Napoleonic\nconflicts \u2018the late war against national\nindependence\u2019 \u2013 a struggle for France\u2019s\nself-assertion against an Alliance determined to\ncrush its new freedoms. The success of this\naggression may \u2018serve for a precedent fatal to\nour own liberties\u2019 (Last Reign, i. xi). Hobhouse\nhere associates general European freedom with\nthe capacity for states to operate independently,\nunmolested by other powers. This argument is\nclearly problematic, since it can be argued that\nFrench foreign policy before and during\nNapoleon\u2019s reign violated the freedoms of other\n\u2018independent\u2019 states. Nevertheless, Hobhouse\nadvocates an idea of Europe based on \u2018the\nprinciples of national liberty\u2019, suggesting that\ngreater international co-operation can be\nachieved by separately-operating states,\nbecause powers would be discouraged from\ninterfering in each other\u2019s affairs. He looks\nforward to the moment when \u2018the alliance will\ndissolve\u2019 and \u2018the first decisive triumph of the\nprinciples of national liberty will be witnessed\u2019.\nIf this occurs, \u2018a new system\u2019 of Europe can\ndevelop, based on the freedom of separate states\n(Last Reign, ii. 217). Once again, there is a\nradical agenda here: Hobhouse hopes that this\nrevolutionary change will \u2018embrace state after\nstate\u2019, eventually encompassing \u2018the fairest\nportion of the civilised world\u2019 (Last Reign,\nii. 217).\nThis association of liberty with revolution\nand national self-determination would become\nan important part of Byron\u2019s thinking as his\ninterest in Greek independence developed in the\n1820s. Before landing on the Greek mainland,\nhe would justify his purpose using the language\nof nation-building \u2013 \u2019I did not come here to join\na faction, but a nation\u2019 \u2013 and the language of\nfreedom: \u2018the fruitful [. . . boughs?] of the tree\nof Liberty\u2019 will flourish.22 According to his\nacquaintance James Kennedy (a clergyman on\nCephalonia), Byron proclaimed, \u2018 \u201cI love the\ncause of liberty, which is that of the Greek\nnation\u201d\u2018.23 Calling on the support of Edward\nChurch, the United States consul in Geneva,\nByron says: \u2018an American has a better right\nthan any other to suggest to other nations \u2013 the\nLiberty and Independence 127\nmode of obtaining that Liberty which is the\nglory of his own\u2019 (letter dated 21 June 1823,\nBLJ, x. 202). In this sense, the cause of liberty\nhelps create both independent nationhood and a\ntransnational movement joined in opposition to\ntyrannous government. A similar idea is\nevident in some assessments of Napoleon\u2019s\ndefeat. The preface to the 1816 Annual Register\nsays that in Germany:\npopular writers had been encouraged to\narouse and create patriotic feelings by the\ncontrast between slavish submission to a\ndetestable foreign tyranny, and the\nacquiescence of freemen in a constitution.\nThis excites anti-Napoleonic feeling by\nuniting the language of liberty and nationalism.\nBut it also moves beyond its German specificity\nto present an idea of Europe in which many\ncountries are connected by their shared\nfreedom, formed in opposition to Napoleonic\nhegemony. Britain\u2019s victory was partly assured\nby \u2018the liberalities of our political institutions\u2019\nand other states, including Russia, have\nemulated this with \u2018openness and success\u2019. In\nthis last case, \u2018liberty\u2019 refers both to a national\ntrait and to an idea which can potentially shape\nall Europe.24\nPatriotism Beyond the Local\nDebate about what Europe is (or what\nit should be) thus hinges on a few key\nconcepts \u2013 \u2019liberty\u2019, \u2018freedom\u2019,\n\u2018independence\u2019 \u2013which can be appropriated for\na variety of ideological purposes. \u2018Liberty\u2019 can\nbe used to evoke a shared European tradition\nand a Europe of separate states asserting\nthemselves against one another. These various\nusages of the term \u2018liberty\u2019 might seem\ncontradictory. However, they can be connected\nusing the argument of William Hazlitt\u2019s essay\n\u2018On Patriotism\u2019 (1814). In the essay, Hazlitt\ntheorises a nationalism which legitimises a\nwider, transnational, collective identity.\nLove of country, he says, \u2018is little more than\nanother name for the love of liberty, of\nindependence, of peace, and social happiness\u2019.25\nIn other words, patriotism inspires, not merely\na devotion to a particular state, but also a\nuniversalist social vision, an ideal for all\nsocieties. As J. G. A. Pocock observes, \u2018patriot\u2019\nhas a number of disparate meanings in the late\neighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. It\ncould signify devotion to the local nation, but\nalso a person \u2018who loved his or her country\nmore than its ruling family or institutions\u2019 and\nwho professed loyalty to a common identity not\nrepresented by the national government.26\nIn this sense, Hazlitt can use the word both to\nallude to and look beyond the nation,\nevoking shared principles (\u2018liberty\u2019, \u2018peace\u2019)\nwhich are not solely applicable to a specific\nstate.\nHazlitt\u2019s arguments about liberty and\npatriotism rework some of Richard Price\u2019s ideas\nin Discourse on the Love of Our Country\n(1789). Hazlitt was well acquainted with Price\u2019s\nthinking: Price corresponded with Hazlitt\u2019s\nfather, and Hazlitt\u2019s own letters record detailed\nengagement with his works.27 It is therefore\nlikely that Hazlitt had read the Discourse,\nespecially given its heightened public\nprominence (even notoriety) following Burke\u2019s\nattack on the text in Reflections on the\nRevolution (1790).28 Indeed, Hazlitt alludes to\nBurke\u2019s disagreement with Price in The\nEloquence of the British Senate (1807), when\nhe mentions the \u2018theories of Mr Burke and\nDr Price on the subject [of revolution]\u2019.29 In the\nDiscourse, Price interprets the Revolution in\nterms of \u2018liberty\u2019:\nI have lived to see nations panting for liberty\nwhich seemed to have no idea of it.\nI have lived to see thirty millions of people\ndemanding liberty with an irresistible voice,\ntheir King led in triumph, and an arbitrary\nmonarch surrendering himself to his\nsubjects.30\n128 Romanticism\nPrice celebrates the specific triumph of the\nFrench state in freeing itself from despotic rule.\nThis is the \u2018liberty\u2019 of a state discovering its\nindependence, freeing itself from the weight of\npast tradition and the disapproval of\nneighbouring countries. In this respect, the\nFrench Revolution has helped legitimise specific\nnew national identities: \u2018Liberty is the [. . . ]\nobject of patriotic zeal [as] an enlightened\ncountry must be a free country\u2019 (p. 19).\nHowever, Price also suggests that this \u2018freedom\u2019\nhas implications for the whole of Europe:\nI see the ardour for liberty catching and\nspreading a general amendment in human\naffairs; the dominion of kings changed for\nthe dominion of laws, and the dominion of\npriests giving way to the dominion of reason\nand conscience. (p. 50)\nThe blaze of Revolution \u2018lays despotism in\nashes, and warms and illuminates Europe!\u2019\n(p. 50). \u2018Freedom\u2019 establishes a patriotic\nidentity, marking the uniqueness of France, but\nit also creates collective hopes for \u2018Europe\u2019\nbased on the shared principles of law, reason\nand opposition to despotism. For Price, as for\nHazlitt, patriotism inspires not merely a\ndevotion to a particular state, but also a\nuniversalist social vision, an ideal for all\nsocieties. Hazlitt\u2019s patriotism, associated with\n(revolutionary) social change, therefore has\nboth national and transnational implications.\nThis is patriotism beyond the \u2018local\u2019, which\nhopes for universal \u2018common liberties\u2019\nextending across all Europe and beyond.\nThese arguments provide a useful framework\nto understand Percy Shelley\u2019s comments about\n\u2018freedom\u2019 in 1816. Writing to Thomas Peacock,\nhe connects freedom with national specificity\nwhilst purporting to question precisely that\nconnection:\nYou live in a free country where you may act\nwithout restraint & possess that which you\npossess in security; for as long as the name of\ncountry & the selfish conceptions which it\nincluded shall subsist England I am\npersuaded, is the most free and refined.\n(Percy Shelley, Letters, i. 474\u20135)\nShelley identifies and seeks to move beyond\na particularly English freedom: while declaring\nhis patriotic attachment to \u2018England, my\ncountry dear to me for ever\u2019, he also critiques\nthe limited experiences available to one \u2018who\nhas never passed the limits of his native land\u2019\n(Letters, i. 475). Percy Shelley advocates what\nmight be called a \u2018cosmopolitan patriotism\u2019,\nwhich predicates itself on experience and\nappreciation of other countries. In celebrating\nand seeking to overcome the separations\nbetween European states, Price similarly\nexhorted listeners to: \u2018explain the duty we owe\nto our country, and the nature, foundation, and\nproper expressions of that love to it\u2019, but also\nwarns against \u2018contempt of other countries, and\nforming men into combinations and factions\nagainst their common rights and liberties\u2019\n(Discourse, 1\u20132, 5). When they rail against\ndespotism in France, Turkey or Russia, Price\nand Shelley patriotically assert Britain\u2019s\nsuperiority, but also regret that\n\u2018common. . . liberties\u2019, a cosmopolitan notion of\nshared \u2018rights\u2019, have not extended there.\nFor Price, Hazlitt and Shelley therefore,\n\u2018liberty\u2019 has a parochial meaning related to state\nindependence and a transnational meaning\nsignifying the collective development of all\nEurope. More importantly, these meanings are\nnot necessarily incompatible. For all three\nwriters, it is perfectly possible to be patriotic, to\ndefend local independence, and to hope for a\n\u2018liberty\u2019 which unifies states across Europe\nunder a common system. This is because the\nkey tenets of radical \u2018liberty\u2019 \u2013 opposition to\ndespotism, to monarchical or religious\nprivilege \u2013 are both national and transnational\ncauses. That is to say, the independence of a\nspecific country and the establishment of\ncommon \u2018freedom\u2019 in Europe are part of the\nsame radical project. The true patriot desires\nreform at home and abroad; he wishes to\nLiberty and Independence 129\ncelebrate success in his own country and to\ninstigate changes based on common principles\nacross all Europe. It is therefore possible to be\nboth a patriot and a cosmopolitan\nsimultaneously, because \u2018love of one\u2019s country\u2019\nand the desire for international co-operation are\nbased on commitment to the same radical\nprinciples. For the Shelley\u2013Byron circle, ideas\nof state independence and common European\nliberty are not as disconnected as might first\nappear, since both are founded in a radical\nvision of the ideal society.\nBirkbeck, University of London\nNotes\n1.
