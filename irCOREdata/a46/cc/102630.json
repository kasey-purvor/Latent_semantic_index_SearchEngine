Much hope for spontaneous and robust wireless\ncommunications has been placed in MANETs due to their\ndecentralized, self-configuring, and dynamic nature, which\navoids the need for an expensive base station infrastructure.\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, research focused mainly on designing\ndistributed and dynamic communications protocols for sharing\nthe wireless channel and for discovering routes between\nmobile devices. The aim of these protocols was to provide a\nbasic best-effort level of service to ensure network operation\nin the face of an unpredictable and shared wireless communi-\ncation medium and to maintain a network topology view and\nroutes in the face of failing links and mobile devices.\nDespite the vast array of technological solutions for\nMANETs, their practical implementation and use in the real\nworld has been limited so far. Since entertainment and other\nmultimedia services are usually what drive the mass uptake of\na technology, it follows that to truly realize the potential of\nMANETs, they must be able to deliver such services, for\nwhich best-effort protocols are not adequate.\nThis is because multimedia applications often have strin-\ngent time- and reliability-sensitive service requirements, which\nthe network must cater to. As a consequence, especially in the\npast five or six years, focus has shifted from best-effort ser-\nvices to the provision of higher and better-defined QoS in\nMANET research. QoS routing protocols play a major part in\na QoS mechanism, since it is their task to find which nodes, if\nany, can serve an application\u2019s requirements. Therefore, the\nQoS routing protocol also plays a major part in session admis-\nsion control (SAC), since that is dependent on the discovery\nof a route that can support the requested QoS. Alternatively,\nsome QoS routing solutions may not attempt to serve applica-\ntions\u2019 requirements directly, rather they may seek to improve\nall-round QoS under particular metrics.\nThe majority of the solutions proposed in the literature till\nnow have focused on providing QoS based on two metrics:\nthroughput and delay. Of these, the more common is through-\nput. This is probably because assured throughput is somewhat\nof a \u201clowest common denominator\u201d requirement; most voice\nor video applications require some level of guaranteed\nA\nLAJOS HANZO II AND RAHIM TAFAZOLLI, UNIVERSITY OF SURREY\nABSTRACT\nIn mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), the provision of quality of ser-\nvice (QoS) guarantees is much more challenging than in wireline networks,\nmainly due to node mobility, multihop communications, contention for\nchannel access, and a lack of central coordination. QoS guarantees are\nrequired by most multimedia and other time- or error-sensitive applica-\ntions. The difficulties in the provision of such guarantees have limited the\nusefulness of MANETs. However, in the last decade, much research atten-\ntion has focused on providing QoS assurances in MANET protocols. The\nQoS routing protocol is an integral part of any QoS solution since its func-\ntion is to ascertain which nodes, if any, are able to serve applications\u2019\nrequirements. Consequently, it also plays a crucial role in data session\nadmission control. This document offers an up-to-date survey of most\nmajor contributions to the pool of QoS routing solutions for MANETs pub-\nlished in the period 1997\u20132006. We include a thorough overview of QoS\nrouting metrics, resources, and factors affecting performance and classify\nthe protocols found in the literature. We also summarize their operation\nand describe their interactions with the medium access control (MAC) pro-\ntocol, where applicable. This provides the reader with insight into their dif-\nferences and allows us to highlight trends in protocol design and identify\nareas for future research.\nA SURVEY OF QOS ROUTING SOLUTIONS FOR\nMOBILE AD HOC NETWORKS\n2ND QUARTER 2007, VOLUME 9, NO. 2\nwww.comsoc.org\/pubs\/surveys\n1553-877X\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

However,\nmany other metrics are also used to quantify QoS and in this\nwork we cover most of them and provide examples of their\nuse. The remainder of this article is structured as follows. In\nthe following section we discuss related work in terms of QoS\nrouting surveys and summarize their main points. This is fol-\nlowed by a brief review of the challenges posed by the provi-\nsion of QoS on the MANET environment. Next, we present\nan overview of commonly employed QoS routing metrics, the\nfactors affecting QoS protocol performance, the network\nresources consumable by applications, and some of the trade-\noffs involved in protocol design. We then continue by describ-\ning some methods of classifying QoS routing solutions, in\norder to organize the many candidate solutions.\nFollowing this, we summarize the operation, key features\nand major advantages and drawbacks of a selection of QoS\nrouting protocols proposed in the literature. We focus on\njournal articles and peer-reviewed conferences, thereby hope-\nfully extracting the most useful and important subset of the\ncandidate solutions. According to one of the classification\nmethods in the fifth section, we discuss the proposals under\nvarious headings. Firstly, the sixth section provides some\nexamples of QoS routing protocols that rely on contention-\nfree MAC. The seventh section does the same for solutions\noperating with a contended MAC. Finally, methods that do\nnot rely on any specific kind of MAC are presented. Under\neach section, we group protocols into different types of\napproaches, although for some approaches, only one example\nis provided. We then discuss our findings and the observed\ntrends in the field of QoS routing. Then, future work areas\nare identified according to our own findings in this survey,\nbefore a summary is given in the final section.\nNote that throughout this article, we consistently employ\nthe term \u201c(data) session\u201d as opposed to some other authors\nwho prefer to use \u201ccall\u201d or \u201c(data) flow.\u201d\nRELATED WORK\nA literature search already yields several overviews and sur-\nveys of QoS routing issues and solutions. However, the last\none was published in early 2004, and in this article we cover\nmany proposals published since then. Also, we select some\ndifferent and less well known protocols for inclusion in our\nsurvey as a means of highlighting alternative approaches to\nQoS routing. We additionally provide a more thorough back-\nground, especially in terms of metrics and design trade-offs,\nand devise new means of classification. Consequently, the\ntrends and future work identified also differ greatly in this\ndocument. A fairly comprehensive overview of the state of the\nfield of QoS in networking in 1999 was provided by Chen in\n[2]. Chakrabarti and Mishra [3] later summarized the impor-\ntant QoS-related issues in MANETs that were in focus around\n2001, and the issues that required further attention. This arti-\ncle was updated and expanded in 2004 [4]. Their conclusions\nhighlighted several significant points:\n\u2022 Many of the underlying algorithmic problems, such as\nmulticonstraint routing, have been shown to be NP-com-\nplete.\n\u2022 QoS and, indeed, best-effort routing can only be success-\nfully achieved if the network is combinatorially stable.\nThis means that the nodes are not moving faster than\nrouting updates can propagate.\n\u2022 Different techniques are required for QoS provisioning\nwhen the network size becomes very large, since QoS\nstate updates would take a relatively long time to propa-\ngate to distant nodes.\n\u2022 There is a trade-off between QoS provisioning and mini-\nmization of power utilization.\nSeveral areas of future work were also identified:\n\u2022 Admission control policies and protocols require further\nattention\n\u2022 QoS robustness\n\u2022 QoS routing protocol security against, for example,\ndenial-of-service attacks \u2014 the combination of security\nand QoS provisioning\n\u2022 Study of QoS preservation under failure conditions\n\u2022 QoS support for multicast applications\nIn 2004, Al-Karaki and Kamal published a detailed\noverview [5] about the state of, and the development trends\nin, the field of QoS routing. They highlighted the following\nareas as requiring further research attention, where some may\nbe duplicated from [4]:\n\u2022 Accommodating multiple classes of traffic, in particular,\nensuring that lower-class traffic is not starved of network\nresources in the presence of realtime traffic; additionally,\nthe inclusion of preemptive scheduling\n\u2022 Preservation of QoS guarantees under various failure\nconditions\n\u2022 The use of position-determination systems such as GPS\nfor aiding QoS routing\n\u2022 Prioritization of control packets above data packets in\nQoS routing\n\u2022 Use of more \u201crealistic\u201d mobility models, as opposed to\nthe overly simplistic ones often employed in simulation\nstudies (for example, random way-point)\n\u2022 Quantifying the impact of cross-layer integration\n\u2022 Interaction of MANETs with the Internet and the impact\non QoS routing thereof\n\u2022 Security in the QoS routing protocol to prevent malicious\nretransmission, snooping, and redirection of packets, for\nexample\n\u2022 The impact of and solutions to network partitioning in\nthe context of QoS routing\n\u2022 The effect of introducing devices that are heterogeneous\nin terms of their capacity and capabilities\nMany of those considerations, such as security and multicast\nrouting, are beyond the scope of this article. In this work we\nfocus on the essence of QoS routing, which is the discovery of\nroutes that can service data sessions and session admission\ncontrol, which depends on the routes discovered.\nIn [5] many of the QoS routing solutions existing in early\n2004 were discussed and categorized into the following types\nof approaches: flat (all nodes play an equal role), hierarchical\n(some nodes are local cluster heads for example), position-\nbased (utilize location information), and power-aware (take\nbattery usage and residual charge into consideration) QoS\nrouting.\nFinally, a thorough overview of the more widely accepted\nMAC and routing solutions for providing better QoS was pre-\nsented in [6]. Reddy et al. also provided various classifications\nof QoS solutions, as discussed below.\nPROBLEMS FACING THE PROVISION OF\nQOS IN MANETS\nThe following is a summary of the major challenges to provid-\ning QoS guarantees in MANETs.\nUnreliable Wireless Channel \u2014 the wireless channel is\nprone to bit errors due to interference from other transmis-\nsions, thermal noise, shadowing, and multipath fading effects\n[7]. This makes it impossible to provide hard packet delivery\nratio or link longevity guarantees.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on December 4, 2009 at 06:36 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nIEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials \u2022 2nd Quarter 200752\nNode Mobility \u2014 the nodes in a MANET may move com-\npletely independently and randomly as far as the communica-\ntions protocols are concerned. This means that topology\ninformation has a limited lifetime and must be updated fre-\nquently to allow data packets to be routed to their destina-\ntions. Again, this invalidates any hard packet delivery ratio or\nlink stability guarantees. Furthermore, a QoS state which is\nlink- or node position dependent must be updated with a fre-\nquency that increases with node mobility.\nAn important general assumption must also be stated here:\nfor any routing protocol to be able to function properly, the\nrate of topology change must not be greater than the rate of\nstate information propagation. Otherwise, the routing infor-\nmation will always be stale and routing will be inefficient or\ncould even fail completely. This applies equally to QoS state\nand QoS route information. A network that satisfies this con-\ndition is said to be combinatorially stable [3].\nLack of Centralized Control \u2014 the major advantage of an\nad hoc network is that it may be set up spontaneously, without\nplanning, and its members can change dynamically. This\nmakes it difficult to provide any form of centralized control.\nAs such, communications protocols which utilize only locally\navailable state and operate in a completely distributed manner\nare preferred [8]. This generally increases an algorithm\u2019s over-\nhead and complexity, as QoS state information must be dis-\nseminated efficiently.\nChannel Contention \u2014 In order to discover network topolo-\ngy, nodes in a MANET must communicate on a common\nchannel. However, this introduces the problems of interfer-\nence and channel contention. For peer-to-peer data communi-\ncations these can be avoided in various ways. One way is to\nattempt global clock synchronization and use a TDMA-based\nsystem where each node may transmit at a predefined time.\nThis is difficult to achieve due to the lack of a central con-\ntroller, node mobility and the complexity and overhead\ninvolved [9]. Other ways are to use a different frequency band\nor spreading code (as in CDMA) for each transmitter. This\nrequires a distributed channel selection mechanism as well as\nthe dissemination of channel information. However data com-\nmunications take place, without a central controller, some set-\nup, new neighbor discovery and control operations must take\nplace on a common contended channel. Indeed, avoiding the\naforementioned complications, much MANET research, as\nwell as the currently most popular wireless ad hoc networking\ntechnology (802.11x) is based on fully-contended access to a\ncommon channel, that is, with Carrier-Sense Multiple Access\nwith Collision Avoidance (CSMA\/CA).\nHowever, CSMA\/CA greatly complicates the calculation of\npotential throughput and packet delay, compared to TDMA-\nbased approaches. This is because nodes must also take into\naccount the traffic at all nodes within their carrier sensing\nrange. Furthermore, the possibility of collisions also arises.\nCollisions waste channel capacity, as well as node battery\nenergy, increase delay, and can degrade the packet delivery\nratio.\nFinally, the well-understood hidden node [10] and exposed\nnode [11] problems are a further consequence of channel con-\ntention. These problems are even more pronounced when we\nconsider that nodes may interfere with transmissions outside\nof their transmission range [9, 12, 13], since receivers are able\nto detect a signal at a much greater distance than that at\nwhich they can decode its information.\nLimited Device Resources \u2014 to some extent this is an histor-\nical limitation, since mobile devices are becoming increasingly\npowerful and capable. However, it still holds true that such\ndevices generally have less computational power, less memory,\nand a limited (battery) power supply, compared to devices\nsuch as desktop computers typically employed in wired net-\nworks. This factor has a major impact on the provision of QoS\nassurances, since low memory capacity limits the amount of\nQoS state that can be stored, necessitating more frequent\nupdates, which incur greater overhead. Additionally, QoS\nrouting generally incurs a greater overhead than best-effort\nrouting in the first place, due to the extra information being\ndisseminated. These factors lead to a higher drain on mobile\nnodes\u2019 limited battery power supply. Finally, within the pool\nof QoS routing problems, many are NP-complete [3], and thus\ncomplicated heuristics are required for solving them, which\nmay place an undue strain on mobile nodes\u2019 less-powerful\nprocessors.\nQOS ROUTING PROTOCOL\nDESIGN CONSIDERATIONS\nMETRICS USED TO SPECIFY QOS REQUIREMENTS\nThe following is a sample of the metrics commonly used by\napplications to specify QoS requirements to the routing proto-\ncol. Consequently, they may be used as constraints on route\ndiscovery and selection. Each metric is followed by a refer-\nence which provides an example of a protocol that employs\nthe metric as a QoS constraint.\n\u2022 Minimum Required Throughput or Capacity (b\/s) \u2014 the\ndesired application data throughput. For an example of\nQoS routing using this metric\/constraint, see [14].\n\u2022 Maximum Tolerable Delay (s) \u2014 usually defined as the\nmaximum tolerable end-to-end (source to destination)\ndelay for data packets [15].\n\u2022 Maximum Tolerable Delay Jitter \u2014 one widely accepted\ndefinition of this metric is the difference between the\nupper bound on end-to-end delay and the absolute mini-\nmum delay [16]. The former incorporates the queuing\ndelay at each node and the latter is determined by the\npropagation delay and the transmission time of a packet.\nThe transmission time between two nodes is simply the\npacket size in bits\/the channel capacity. This metric can\nalso be expressed as delay variance [17].\n\u2022 Maximum Tolerable Packet Loss Ratio (PLR) \u2014 the\nacceptable percentage of total packets sent, which are\nnot received by the transport or higher layer agent at the\npacket\u2019s final destination node [18].\nAn application may typically request a particular quality of\nservice by specifying its requirements in terms of one or more\nof the above metrics. For example, it may require a guaran-\nteed throughput of 500 kb\/s and a maximum packet delay of\n50 ms. In most cases, the QoS protocol should only admit this\ndata session into the network if it can provide the requested\nservice. The mechanism by which this decision is made is\ntermed session admission control (SAC) or just admission\ncontrol.\nNODE STATES AND METRICS EMPLOYED FOR\nROUTE SELECTION\nThis section lists many of the metrics commonly employed by\nrouting protocols for path evaluation and selection in order to\nimprove all-round QoS or to meet the specific requirements\nof application data sessions. Many of these metrics, especially\nthose measured at lower layers, are not directly interesting to\nthe application layer; hence, they are listed in this section.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on December 4, 2009 at 06:36 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nIEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials \u2022 2nd Quarter 2007 53\nHowever, they all, at least indirectly, affect the QoS experi-\nenced by a data session.\nNetwork Layer Metrics\n\u2022 Achievable throughput or residual capacity (b\/s) \u2014 the\nachievable data throughput of a path or node. The\nachievable throughput or residual capacity is often\ntermed \u201cavailable bandwidth\u201d in the literature; we pre-\nfer to reserve the use of the word \u201cbandwidth\u201d for\nquantifying the size of frequency bands in Hz. For an\nexample of QoS routing using this metric\/constraint, see\n[14].\n\u2022 End-to-end delay(s) \u2014 the measured end-to-end delay on\na path [15].\n\u2022 Node buffer space \u2014 the number of packets in a node\u2019s\ntransmission buffer plays a major part in determining the\namount of delay a packet traveling through that node\nwill suffer (for example, see [19]).\n\u2022 Delay jitter(s) or variance \u2014 the measured delay jitter on\na path. See the previous section for a definition.\n\u2022 Packet loss ratio (PLR) (percent) \u2014 the percentage of\ntotal packets sent, which is not received by the transport\nor higher layer agent at the packet\u2019s final destination\nnode.\n\u2022 Energy expended per packet (J) [20].\n\u2022 Route lifetime(s) \u2014 the statistically calculated expected\nlifetime of a route, which can depend on node mobility\nas well as node battery charges (see [21]).\nLink and MAC Layer Metrics\n\u2022 MAC delay \u2014 the time taken to transmit a packet\nbetween two nodes in a contention-based MAC, includ-\ning the total time deferred and the time to acknowledge\nthe data [22]. This provides a good indication of the\namount of traffic at the relevant nodes.\n\u2022 Link reliability or frame delivery ratio \u2014 the statistically\ncalculated chance (percentage) of a packet or frame\nbeing transmitted over a link and correctly decoded at\nthe receiver. See [23, 24] for examples of routing proto-\ncols employing this metric for path selection.\n\u2022 Link stability(s) \u2014 the predicted lifetime of a link [21].\n\u2022 Node relative mobility\/stability \u2014 can be measured as the\nratio of the number of neighbors that change over a fixed\nperiod to the number that remain the same [25]. For\nexample, if all of the node\u2019s neighbors are the same over\na fixed period, that node is completely stable in that peri-\nod, relative to its neighbors. We list this as a link-layer\nmetric, since neighbor discovery is usually performed at\nthat layer.\nPhysical Layer Metrics\n\u2022 Signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) \u2014 although a physical\nlayer metric, the received SIR at a destination node can\nbe used as a routing metric that shows link quality, via\ncross-layer communication. An example is given in [26].\n\u2022 Bit error rate (BER) \u2014 closely related to SIR, this value\ndetermines the level of error correction and\/or number\nof retransmissions required over a \u201clink\u201d and has a major\nimpact on the link\u2019s reliability metric and on energy con-\nsumption. From another perspective, the BER is a conse-\nquence of the SIR between two nodes. For an example,\nsee [27].\n\u2022 Node residual battery charge or cost [20]. Examples are\ngiven in [23, 28].\nQoS metrics such as the above can be classified as either addi-\ntive, concave, or multiplicative metrics, based on their mathe-\nmatical properties [6]. Additive metrics are defined as\nover path P of length n, where Li(m) is the value of the metric\nm over link Li and Li \u2208 P. The value of a concave metric Cm\nis defined as the minimum value of that metric over a path,\nthat is, Cm = min(Li(m)). Finally, a multiplicative metric Mm\nis calculated by taking the product of the values along a path,\nthat is,\nThus, end-to-end delay for example, is an additive metric,\nsince it is cumulative over the whole path. Available channel\ncapacity is a concave metric, since we are only interested in\nthe bottleneck: the minimum value on the path. Finally, path\nreliability is a multiplicative metric, since the reliabilities of\neach link in the path must be multiplied together to compute\nthe chance of delivering the packet via a given route (assum-\ning that the MAC layer retransmissions have been considered\nin the reliability value, or that there are no retransmissions for\nexample, for broadcast packets).\nPROTOCOL EVALUATION METRICS\nThe following metrics may be used to evaluate a QoS routing\nprotocol\u2019s performance.\nTransport\/Application Layer\n\u2022 Session acceptance\/blocking ratio \u2014 the percentage of\napplication data sessions (or transport layer connections)\nthat are admitted into or rejected from the network. The\nvalue of this metric reflects both the effectiveness of the\nQoS protocols as well as conditions outside of their con-\ntrol, such as channel quality.\n\u2022 Session completion\/dropping ratio \u2014 this metric repre-\nsents the percentage of applications that were successful-\nly\/ unsuccessfully served after being admitted to the\nnetwork. For example, if a VoIP session is accepted and\nthe session is completed properly (by the users hanging\nup) and not aborted (dropped) due to route failure or\nany other error, then that counts as a completed session.\nNetwork Layer\n\u2022 Network throughput (b\/s) \u2014 the amount of data traffic the\nentire network carried to its destination in one second.\n\u2022 Per-node throughput (b\/s) \u2014 the average throughput\nachieved by a single node.\n\u2022 Route discovery delay(s) for reactive protocols \u2014 a mea-\nsure of the effectiveness of reactive protocols, that is, on\naverage, what is the delay between a route request being\nissued and a reply with a valid route being received. In\nsome cases, this may also be referred to as the session\nestablishment time (SET).\n\u2022 Normalized routing load (NRL) \u2014 the ratio of routing\npackets transmitted to data packets received at the desti-\nnation. This gives a measure of the operating cost and\nefficiency of the routing protocol. An example is given in\n[29].\n\u2022 Network lifetime(s) \u2014 may be defined as the time until\nnetwork partitioning occurs due to node failure [20], or\nthe time until a specified proportion of nodes fail. This\nmeasure indicates a protocol\u2019s energy-efficiency and load\nbalancing ability.\n\u2022 Average node lifetime(s) \u2014 see [20].\nM L mm i\ni\nn\n=\n=\n\u220f ( )\n1\nL mi\ni\nn\n( )\n=\n\u2211\n1\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

An example is given\nin [29].\n\u2022 MAC energy efficiency \u2014 ratio of energy used for send-\ning data bits to the total energy expended for data plus\nMAC headers and control frames.\nFACTORS AFFECTING QOS PROTOCOL PERFORMANCE\nWhen evaluating the performance of QoS protocols, a num-\nber of factors have a major impact on the results. Some of\nthese parameters are a particular manifestation of characteris-\ntics of the MANET environment. They define the \u201cscenario,\u201d\nwhether in a simulation or in real life, and can be summarized\nas follows:\n\u2022 Node mobility \u2014 this factor generally encompasses sever-\nal parameters: the nodes\u2019 maximum and minimum\nspeeds, speed pattern, and pause time. The node\u2019s speed\npattern determines whether the node moves at uniform\nspeed at all times or whether it is constantly varying, and\nalso how it accelerates, for example, uniformly or expo-\nnentially with time. The pause time determines the\nlength of time nodes remain stationary between each\nperiod of movement. Together with maximum and mini-\nmum speed, this parameter determines how often the\nnetwork topology changes and thus how often network\nstate information must be updated. This parameter has\nbeen the focus of many studies, for example, [29, 30].\n\u2022 Network size \u2014 since QoS state has to be gathered or\ndisseminated in some way for routing decisions to be\nmade, the larger the network, the more difficult this\nbecomes in terms of update latency and message over-\nhead. This is the same as with all network state informa-\ntion, such as that used in best-effort protocols [8].\n\u2022 Number, type and data rate of traffic sources \u2014 intuitive-\nly, a smaller number of traffic sources results in fewer\nroutes being required and vice versa. Traffic sources can\nbe constant bit rate (CBR) or may generate bits or pack-\nets at a rate that varies with time according to the Pois-\nson distribution, or any other mathematical model. The\nmaximum data rate affects the number of packets in the\nnetwork and hence the network load. All of these factors\naffect performance significantly [29];\n\u2022 Node transmission power \u2014 some nodes may have the\nability to vary their transmission power. This is impor-\ntant, since at a higher power, nodes have more direct\nneighbors and hence connectivity increases, but the inter-\nference between nodes does as well. Transmission power\ncontrol can also result in unidirectional links between\nnodes, which can affect the performance of routing pro-\ntocols. This factor has also been studied extensively, for\nexample, in [31\u201333].\n\u2022 Channel characteristics \u2014 as detailed above, there are\nmany reasons for the wireless channel being unreliable,\nthat is, many reasons why bits, and hence data packets,\nmay not be delivered correctly. These all affect the net-\nwork\u2019s ability to provide QoS.\nNETWORK RESOURCES REQUIRED IN ORDER TO\nPROVIDE QOS\nAnother question that arises in this section is: what do we\nmean by \u201cnetwork resources?\u201d Taken literally, a resource is\nanything that is required in order to perform a task and which\nis consumed during performance. Therefore, the following is a\nlist of network resources:\n\u2022 Node computing time \u2014 while mobile devices are being\nmanufactured with increasingly powerful processors, they\nare still limited in computing power, especially when they\nmust not only run the applications, but also the protocols\nrequired to support the network and the applications.\nHowever, this is probably the least critical resource, as\ncommunication protocols usually do not place a heavy\nburden on the processor.\n\u2022 Node battery charge \u2014 some might argue that this is the\nmost critical resource, since if a node\u2019s battery is drained,\nit cannot function at all. Node failures can also cause\nnetwork partitioning, leading to a complete network fail-\nure and no service provisioning at all. Hence, power-\naware and energy efficient MAC and routing protocols\nhave received a great deal of research attention (see [20,\n33] and references therein). However, these efforts are\nbeyond the immediate scope of this article.\n\u2022 Node buffer space (memory) \u2014 almost inevitably, at\nsome point during a network\u2019s operation, more than one\nnode will be transmitting at once, or there may be no\nknown route to another device. In either of these cases\ndata packets must be buffered while awaiting transmis-\nsion. Furthermore, when the buffers are full, any newly\narriving packets must be dropped, contributing to the\npacket loss rate;\n\u2022 Channel capacity \u2014 taken literally, this is measured in\nbps and affects data throughput, and indirectly, delay,\nand hence a host of other metrics too. However, since all\nnodes must share the transmission medium, we must\nsomehow express the fraction of the medium\u2019s total\ncapacity that is granted for each node\u2019s use. The way to\nexpress this depends on the MAC layer technique\nemployed. In a purely contention-based MAC, \u201ctransmis-\nsion opportunities\u201d may be envisioned, although no node\ncan be guaranteed channel access, merely granted it with\na certain probability. In a Time Division Multiple Access\n(TDMA)-based solution, channel capacity is expressed in\ntimeslots. Similarly, in FDMA, it is frequency bands, and\nin spread spectrum techniques, spreading codes. Since, in\nMANETs, nodes must communicate on the same chan-\nnel to discover network topology, FDMA and spread\nspectrum techniques are only employed if there is a sepa-\nrate signaling channel over which to allocate channels to\npairs of communicating nodes. The majority of QoS\nrouting solutions in the literature rely on single-channel\nMAC protocols and are thus contention- or TDMA-\nbased, as we show in this work.\nDESIGN TRADE-OFFS\nThis section discusses some of the common trade-offs involved\nin QoS routing protocol design.\nProactive vs. Reactive vs. Hybrid Route Discovery and\nState Dissemination \u2014 We actually refer to two problems\nunder one heading. Firstly, should routes be discovered pro-\nactively or on-demand? Secondly, how should the QoS state\nrequired for path selection be discovered? If both the route\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on December 4, 2009 at 06:36 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nIEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials \u2022 2nd Quarter 2007 55\nand QoS state discovery mechanisms are proactive, then the\nsession establishment time is greatly reduced from an applica-\ntion\u2019s point of view. Also, a proactive protocol is largely unaf-\nfected by an increase in the fraction of nodes acting as data\nsources, since routes to all destinations are maintained any-\nway. However, a large overhead is incurred in keeping routes\nand state up-to-date, especially in highly mobile scenarios.\nAdditionally, such a mechanism does not scale well with an\nincreasing number of nodes. These are well known problems\nof proactive protocols [8].\nA major advantage of discovering QoS state proactively\nsurfaces in situations where different applications specify their\nrequirements with different metrics. As long as it is decided\nwhich QoS states to keep up-to-date, a route may be comput-\ned from the routing table based on any QoS metric, without\nthe need for a separate discovery process for each metric for\nexample, see [34].\nA purely reactive routing solution avoids the potential\nwastage of channel capacity and energy by not discovering\nroutes and QoS states which are not currently needed. How-\never, a discovery delay is incurred when an application\nrequires a route to a destination.\nA hybrid route discovery approach usually involves defin-\ning zones around each node within which proactive route dis-\ncovery takes place (for example, see [25]). Interzone routing is\nperformed on-demand, eliminating the scaling problems of\npurely proactive protocols, while intrazone routing enjoys the\nbenefits of routes being readily available.\nHybrid route discovery\/state discovery schemes are also\nfeasible. One possibility is where the routes themselves are\ndiscovered proactively, but the QoS state is only sought when\na QoS-constrained data session is to be admitted (for exam-\nple, see [15, 35]). Another possibility is a completely hybrid\napproach where the QoS state discovery follows the proac-\ntive\/reactive intrazone\/interzone nature of route discovery.\nCapacity vs. Delay \u2014 It has been shown [36, 37] that in\nMANETs, capacity can be traded off with packet delay. If\ndelay constraints are relaxed, then the capacity of the network\ncan be increased by exploiting multi-user diversity [36]. More\nspecifically, if delay is not constrained, a source can split the\npackets of a session and send them to many different neigh-\nbors. These neighbors then forward the packets onto the des-\ntination when they move into its transmission range. This\nscheme has been shown to improve throughput, since far\nfewer intermediate nodes are transmitting packets and causing\ninterference, but incurs the cost of greatly increased delay\n[36].\nAnother strategy is to improve delay by increasing redun-\ndancy, at the cost of network capacity utilization efficiency\n[37]. If multiple copies of a packet are forwarded on multiple\npaths, it has been shown that the destination receives the\npacket with less delay on average. On the other hand, more\nnetwork capacity is consumed in sending duplicate packets\n[37]. Clearly, increased redundancy also reduces the protocol\u2019s\nenergy efficiency.\nPacket Loss Ratio vs. Capacity and Energy Efficiency \u2014\nIn a similar way to the trade-off between delay and capacity,\nPLR can also be traded off against capacity. Increasing the\nredundancy by sending multiple copies of packets over differ-\nent routes results in a higher chance of the destination receiv-\ning a copy, but reduces the useful capacity of the network.\nThis technique can be more useful in sensor networks where\ndata are often broadcast without a reliable handshaking pro-\ntocol being employed at the MAC layer. Once again, redun-\ndancy also increases the energy expended per packet.\nEnergy Consumption vs. Responsiveness and Accuracy of\nQoS State Information \u2014 Routing can only be accurate if\nthe frequency of neighbor discovery is high enough to reflect\nfrequent topological changes. However, a high responsiveness\nto change comes at an increased energy cost [38]. If we con-\nsider QoS routing, this trade-off between accuracy and energy\nconsumption is even more acute, since not only the topology\nview, but the QoS state information also requires frequent\nupdating so as to enable accurate QoS routing decisions to be\nmade.\nTransmission Power Control: Long vs. Short Hops \u2014\nVarying the transmission power to adjust the number of hops\nrequired to forward a packet to its destination, can yield many\nadvantages and drawbacks. This has often been called the\n\u201clong hops versus short hops dilemma.\u201d For a detailed discus-\nsion of this topic, see [39]. Another question is whether proto-\ncol designers should assume the use of transmission power\ncontrol (TPC) at all. Assuming TPC constrains the type of\ndevices that can be employed, since not all nodes may be\nequipped with radios with TPC capability. Furthermore,\nemploying TPC can often result in unidirectional links. For\nexample, a node X may be able to transmit to a node Y, but\nY cannot reply, since it is using a lower transmission power,\nunless it knows the distance to X and can calculate the trans-\nmission power required to reach it.\nGlobal Goals vs. Individual Requirements \u2014 From a net-\nwork designer\u2019s point of view, the goal is usually to please as\nmany users as possible by providing an all-round high QoS.\nAnother goal is to increase the network lifetime by spreading\nthe battery usage to avoid node failures and network parti-\ntioning. However, each individual user or data session has its\nown specific requirements and, to satisfy the user, the network\nmust match their requirements.\nIn more complicated scenarios, an application may specify\na variety of QoS constraints. For example, it may specify max-\nimum tolerable values for PLR as well as packet delay. In this\ncase, we desire the routing protocol to find a stable path with\na light traffic load. However, from a network lifetime point of\nview, a path that has the least cost (under some residual bat-\ntery charge-dependent metric) is preferred. Our goal of low\ndelay matches the aim of load balancing, although the path\nwith the least traffic may not be a stable path and it may also\nhave nodes with the least battery charge remaining. In this\ncase, we clearly have a conflict between our various require-\nments. A protocol designer must decide how to address this\ntrade-off.\nPROTOCOL CLASSIFICATION\nIn [5], QoS routing protocols are classified chiefly by their:\n\u2022 Treatment of network topology (flat, hierarchical, or\nlocation-aware)\n\u2022 Approach to route discovery (proactive, reactive, hybrid,\nor predictive)\nOn the other hand, in [6] they are classified in three different\nways, based upon:\n\u2022 The interaction between the route discovery and QoS\nprovisioning mechanism (coupled or decoupled)\n\u2022 The interaction with the MAC layer (either independent\nor dependent)\n\u2022 Again, on the approach to route discovery\nIn this article we elaborate on the MAC protocol interac-\ntion classification, by considering three classes of QoS routing\nsolutions:\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Such protocols are able to provide what\nwe term pseudo-hard QoS. Hard QoS guarantees can only\nbe provided in a wired network, where there are no unpre-\ndictable channel conditions and node movements. In the\nsolutions that employ a contention-free MAC, the QoS\nguarantees provided are essentially hard, except for when\nchannel fluctuations or node failures or movements occur,\nand hence the term \u201cpseudo-hard.\u201d Due to these unpre-\ndictable conditions, a MANET is not a suitable environ-\nment for providing truly hard QoS guarantees.\n2 Those that rely only on a contended MAC protocol and\ntherefore only on the available resources or achievable\nperformance to be statistically estimated. Such protocols\ntypically use these estimations to provide statistical or\nsoft guarantees. Implicit resource reservation may still be\nperformed, by not admitting data sessions which are like-\nly to degrade the QoS of previously admitted ones. How-\never, all guarantees are based on contended and\nunpredictable channel access or are given only with a\ncertain probability and are thus inherently soft.\n3 Those that do not require any MAC layer interaction at\nall and are thus independent from the MAC protocol.\nSuch protocols cannot offer any type of QoS guarantees\nthat rely on a certain level of channel access. They typi-\ncally estimate node or link states and attempt to route\nusing those nodes and links for which more favorable\nconditions exist. However, the achievable level of perfor-\nmance is usually not quantified or is only relative and\ntherefore no promises can be made to applications. The\naim of such protocols is typically to foster a better aver-\nage QoS for all packets according to one or more met-\nrics. This comes often at the cost of trade-offs with other\naspects of performance (above), increased complexity,\nextra message overhead, or limited applicability.\nIn this article we classify and summarize the operation of\n20 different QoS routing solution proposals published in high-\nquality literature in the period 1997\u20132006. This allows us to\nhighlight the variety of approaches investigated, as well as to\nobserve the trends in the field.\nFigure 1 illustrates the classification of the 20 protocols\nbased on MAC protocol dependence.

Table 1 and\nTable 2 summarize the salient features of the 20 protocols\nwhose operation we discuss in later sections.\nClassifying based on the QoS metric(s) employed for path\nevaluation and selection is also possible. However, this classi-\nfication is not as simple, since many protocols utilize several\nmetrics. In Fig. 2, we have chosen to provide a list of the\nmore popular routing metrics down the centre of the diagram\nand the protocols are shown either side for increased spatial\nclarity. A line connects each metric to every protocol which\nuses it for routing. This illustrates which metrics are more\npopular by the number of protocols they are linked to. It also\nshows which protocols utilize a single metric and which ones\nimplement multiconstraint QoS routing. A special case is\nTBR which is designed to consider two metrics, but not simul-\ntaneously; therefore, it is not a multiconstraint routing proto-\ncol, and is represented twice: once for each metric. NSR is\nalso a special case. The designers explain how it can be pro-\nvide an assured throughput service, but it also acts as a frame-\nwork for routing based on any other metric.\nPROTOCOLS RELYING ON\nCONTENTION-FREE MAC\nQOS ROUTING IN A CDMA OVER TDMA NETWORK\nThe problem that first concerned QoS routing protocol\ndesigners was that of discovering paths that satisfy a session\u2019s\nthroughput requirement. This was due to the fact that assured\nthroughput seemed to be the lowest common denominator\namong multimedia data sessions\u2019 requirements. Since through-\nput depends largely on a node gaining sufficient transmission\nopportunities at the MAC layer, the first part of the solution\nis to define measures of transmission opportunities, that is,\nthe channel capacity available to a node. Following this, a\nmechanism is required for estimating the achievable through-\nput on a path, utilizing the knowledge of the available channel\ncapacity at each forwarding node. Finally, this information can\nbe used to perform session admission control, by only admit-\nting data sessions for which a path with adequate throughput\ncapability has been found.\nAn early channel-capacity estimation scheme for mobile\nwireless networks (so-called at the time), was presented in\n[40]. The authors proposed that a clustering scheme is used to\nnFigure 1. Classification of QoS routing protocols based on\nMAC layer dependence. There are three categories: 1) the proto-\ncol's operation depends on an underlying contention-free MAC\nprotocol, 2) it can operate with a contended MAC protocol, 3) it\nis completely independent of the MAC protocol.\nCBCCR\nCCBR\nNSR\nSIRCCR\nTBR\nCAAODV\nCACP\nCEDAR\nCLMCQR\nGAMAN\nMRPC\nODCR\nQGUM\nAAQR\nDSARP\nEBR\nHARP\nIAR\nLSBR\nQOLSR\nContention-\nfree Contended Independent\nMAC protocol dependence\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Within clusters, the channel\nwas time-slotted to deterministically allocate channel access\nopportunities for each node. This allows channel capacity to\nbe measured in terms of timeslots. Furthermore, timeslots\nmay be reserved as a way of promising channel capacity to\nindividual data sessions.\nThe achievable throughput on a link (link capacity) is then\ndetermined by the set of common free slots between a trans-\nmitter\u2013receiver pair. Note that a general assumption in\nMANET design is that a node cannot transmit and receive at\nthe same time, since these actions utilize the same frequency\nband. Therefore, separate timeslots must be employed for\nthese operations. Figure 3 illustrates an example, which is\nexplained later in this section.\nWith this constraint, the calculation of available channel\ncapacity and the scheduling of free slots between transmitter-\nreceiver pairs on a route are known to be NP-complete prob-\nlems [40]. In the proposed scheme, this difficulty is alleviated by\nthe use of clustering; gateway nodes between clusters utilize a\ndifferent spreading code for each cluster and thus avoid the\nchance of having common free slots with upstream and down-\nstream neighbors. Furthermore, the slot scheduling within a\ncluster is solved by the cluster head, avoiding the need for a dis-\ntributed solution. The achievable throughput on a path is then\ndetermined by the minimum of the link capacities on the path.\nThis achievable throughput information is used to augment\nthe classical DSDV routing protocol [45] to perform QoS\nrouting. Timeslots are reserved at nodes by the first arriving\ndata packet and reservations are released when no data pack-\nets are received for a certain number of frames.\nThe ideas in [40] were taken further by Lin and Liu in [14],\nwherein they devised a detailed algorithm for calculating a\npath\u2019s residual traffic capacity, seemingly filling in the gaps in\ndetail left by [40]. Similar to the aforementioned work, they\npropose using a CDMA over TDMA network. The channel is\ntime-slotted accordingly, but several communicating pairs can\nshare a timeslot by employing different spreading codes. A\npath\u2019s capacity is expressed in terms of free timeslots. Route\ndiscovery is based again on DSDV [45]. Routing updates are\nused to refresh the \u201cfree slot\u201d information in routing tables.\nThe proposed algorithm first calculates the best combination\nof free slots on the path for maximum throughput and then\nattempts to reserve them for a particular data session.\nIn brief, the algorithm deals with nodes in groups of three.\nConsider the example in Fig. 3, where nodes A, B, and C are\nintermediate nodes on a path. Below each node we show the\ntimeslots that were free prior to a data session being admit-\nted. In this case, the same six slots were free at each node. At\na first trivial glance it appears that the path capacity is six\nslots. However, if node A transmits to B in slots 1 and 2, as\nshown with the dark shading, node B must use those two slots\nfor receiving (shaded light gray) and thus cannot use those for\ntransmitting. Say then that B forwards the received traffic to\nC in slots 3 and 4. Node C must also not transmit in slots 1\nand 2 for fear of interfering with B\u2019s reception from A at\nnTable 1.

Therefore, C may only transmit in slots 5 and 6.\nThis example illustrates that nodes must have some common\nfree slots to communicate, but if all nodes have the same set\nof free slots, the efficiency of utilization is not very high. In\nFig. 3\u2019s example, the effective path capacity usable by a new\nsession is only two slots, despite six being initially free at each\nnode. Once the available timeslots and path capacity have\nbeen determined, reservation signaling takes place to reserve\nthe necessary timeslots for satisfying the requesting session\u2019s\nthroughput requirement.\nThe two described schemes offer a clear-cut definition of\npath capacity in terms of timeslots and allow a routing proto-\ncol to provide throughput guarantees to application data ses-\nsions by reserving these slots. However, this comes at the cost\nof many assumptions. First of all, assuming a CDMA network\nassumes that each group of nodes is assigned a different\nspreading code. These must either be statically assigned at\nnetwork start-up, or dynamically assigned. The former mecha-\nnism does not deal with nodes\/clusters leaving\/joining the net-\nwork, which is one of the most basic characteristics of ad hoc\nnetworks. The latter scheme assumes that there is some entity\nfor assigning spreading codes, which is against the ad hoc\ndesign principle of not relying on centralized control. Either\nway, these studies [14, 40] do not discuss how code allocation\nwould be achieved.\nA second assumption is that of time-slotting. For each\nframe to begin at the same time at each node, the network\nmust be globally synchronized. Synchronization signaling\nincurs extra overhead, and as stated in previous work [6, 9], in\nthe face of mobility this becomes practically unfeasible. Fur-\nthermore, timeslot assignments must be continually updated\nas nodes move, and sessions are admitted or completed.\nSince these designs were published, new TDMA-based\nMAC protocol designs have come to fruition, such as the\nIEEE 802.15.3 standard [46]. However, this protocol is\ndesigned for use in wireless personal area networks where\nevery node is in range of a controller which provides the time-\nslot schedule. Thus, it is not suitable for wider-area MANETs.\nThe story is the same with related protocols such as 802.15.4.\nThe conclusion is that there is currently no ideal feasible\nsolution for implementing TDMA in a multihop MANET\nenvironment. We detail other protocols that rely on such a\nnetwork in order to highlight their other properties which are\nuseful from a design point of view.\nnTable 2.

The main\nnovelty of their approach was in the method\nof searching for QoS paths. First of all, a\nproactive protocol, such as DSDV [45] is\nassumed to keep routing tables up-to-date,\nwith minimum delay, bottleneck throughput\nand minimum hop to each destination. When\na QoS-constrained path is required for a data\nsession, probes are issued by the source node,\nwhich are used to discover and reserve\nresources on a path.\nEach probe is assigned a number of tickets\nand each ticket represents the permission to\nsearch one path. The more stringent the\ndelay or throughput requirements of the ses-\nsion, the greater the number of tickets issued.\nEach intermediate node uses its routing table\nto decide which neighbors to forward the\nprobe to and with how many of the remaining\ntickets. Neighbors through which a lower\ndelay or higher achievable throughput\n(depending on type of search being per-\nformed) to the destination is estimated, are\nassigned more tickets. So, for example, in Fig.\n4 the source sends a probe with three tickets,\nwhich splits at the second node. Two tickets\nare issued to the bottom path since it is\ndeemed to have a higher chance of satisfying\nthe delay requirement. Due to the nature of\nMANETs, the state information is not\nassumed to be precise and therefore, each\ndelay and bottleneck channel capacity esti-\nmate is assumed to be within a range of the\nestimate, rather than considering the value\naccurate.\nEventually all probes reach the destination, allowing it to\nselect the most suitable path. It then makes soft reservations\nby sending a probe back to the source. This probe also sets\nthe incoming and outgoing links for the connection in each\nnode\u2019s connections table, setting up a soft connection state.\nThe reservations and states expire when data is not forwarded\nvia that virtual connection for a certain period of time, hence\nthe terms soft reservation\/state.\nSpeaking in its favor, this protocol can handle sessions with\neither a delay or throughput constraint. When such a con-\nstrained path is required, flooding is avoided via the ticket\nmechanism, while at the same time ensuring that more paths\nare searched when requirements are stringent, increasing the\nchance of finding a suitable route. Imprecise state information\nis also tolerated. However, the method has several drawbacks.\nFirstly, the protocol used to maintain routing tables for guid-\ning the search probes is proactive, requiring periodic updates,\nthus incurring a large overhead and not scaling well with net-\nwork size. Secondly, the study [15] mentions that a\nTDMA\/CDMA MAC is assumed to take care of channel\ncapacity reservation, which has the drawbacks discussed in the\nprevious section.\nON-DEMAND SIR AND BANDWIDTH-GUARANTEED ROUTING\nWITH TRANSMIT POWER ASSIGNMENT\nA much more recent proposal for a TDMA-based QoS rout-\ning protocol is presented in [26]. Again, channel capacity is\nexpressed in terms of timeslots. However, an interesting char-\nacteristic of this protocol is that it aims to concurrently satisfy\nnot only an application\u2019s throughput requirement, but also its\nbit error rate (BER) constraint. It aims to achieve the latter\nby assigning adequate transmit power to produce the neces-\nsary signal to interference ratio (SIR) between a transmitter\nand receiver pair, thereby providing a sufficiently low BER.\nThis is in contrast to the general trend in previous candidate\nsolutions, which aimed merely to satisfy a single QoS con-\nstraint at any one time.\nnFigure 3.

An advantage of this protocol is\nthat it gathers multiple routes between a source and destina-\ntion and allows them to cooperatively satisfy a data stream\u2019s\nthroughput requirement. However, only paths that fulfill the\nSIR requirement on every link qualify as valid routes; the\nmaximum achievable SIR is limited by the maximum transmit\npower.\nTime is split into frames with a control and data phase,\neach containing several timeslots. In the control phase, each\nnode has a specified slot and uses this to broadcast data phase\nslot synchronization, slot assignment, and power management\ninformation. This broadcast is made at a predefined power\nlevel, for example, full power. The received power can be\nmeasured and knowing the transmit power, the path loss can\nbe calculated. From this, it is possible to calculate the received\nSIR. This in turn leads to an estimation for the required link\ngain and thus the required power at the transmitter, pj\u20131\n(i)est,\nwhere j is the current node in the path and i is the timeslot\nindex.\nWhen a route is required, a RReq is broadcast by the\nsource and is received by direct neighbors. The RReq con-\ntains the number of timeslots and SIR requirements. Times-\nlots at the current node must be idle and not used for\nreceiving, to be considered for reservation. Slots for which\npj\u20131\n(i)est is lower, are preferred. As long as one free slot exists,\nthe node is appended to a list in the RReq packet, along with\nthe required power estimate for the transmitter for that par-\nticular transmission slot. The destination eventually receives\nmultiple RReqs, hence the need for only one free slot on each\npath, since multiple paths can cooperatively serve the through-\nput requirement. It returns RReps to the source along the dis-\ncovered paths, which deliver the estimated power information\nso that the correct power can be set in the relevant transmis-\nsion timeslots. Figure 5 provides an example of an established\nvirtual connection where two paths serve a data session.\nThis proposal is a good example of a common simplistic\napproach to multiconstraint QoS routing: one constraint is\nused merely as a filter, to remove paths which are below a\nthreshold value under that metric. There is no attempt to\noptimize over multiple metrics. However, this problem has\nbeen shown to be NP-complete in many cases [2] (for exam-\nple, when the metrics are additive [48]), and thus heuristic\nsolution methods are a topic for future research. Additionally,\nas before, the assumption of a global clock synchronization,\nwhich is a prerequisite of a time-slotted system limits the use-\nfulness of this proposal.\nNODE STATE ROUTING\nAn interesting proposal is discussed in [34]. The authors sug-\ngest that the approach taken by most QoS routing protocol\ndesigners, of adapting the wireline networking paradigm to ad\nhoc networks, is wrong. According to this paradigm, nodes are\nconnected by physical entities called links and routing should\nbe performed based on disseminating the state of these links.\nHowever, the authors stress that a correct wireless paradigm is\none that realizes that communicating node pairs are not con-\nnected by a shielded link, rather they share a geographical\nspace and the frequency spectrum with all other communicating\npairs in their vicinity. This is clearly true and it follows that\nlinks cannot be considered independently of each other. To cir-\ncumvent this problem, [34] describes node state routing (NSR).\nIn NSR, each node maintains all potentially useful state\ninformation about itself and the space around it, in its routing\ntable. This includes readily-available states such as its IP\naddress, packet queue size and battery charge. However, to\navoid relying on link state propagation, NSR requires position\nawareness via a system such as GPS. This provides more\nstates such as the node\u2019s current location, relative speed and\ndirection of movement. Furthermore, it is assumed that nodes\ncan estimate the path loss to neighboring nodes, using a pre-\nprogrammed propagation model and knowledge of the node\npositions. This allows connectivity to be inferred rather than\n\u201clinks\u201d being discovered. Using the aforementioned states, it\nis also possible to predict connectivity between nodes, whereas\nin most other protocols, links must be discovered.\nIn order to perform routing functions, nodes must periodi-\ncally advertise their states to neighbors. Neighbors should fur-\nther advertise selected states of their neighbors, for example,\nonly those that have changed beyond a threshold. Using the\nstates of its neighbors, a node may then calculate metrics that\nmay be conceived as link metrics, except that measurements\nat both \u201cends\u201d of the link can be taken into account. More-\nover, since node states are readily available, they can be used\nto calculate QoS routes as required.\nnFigure 4. A simple network topology showing a possible ticket-\nbased routing operating scenario. The source issues a probe with\nthree tickets, which then splits as shown. The number of tickets\nassigned to a path is denoted by the number in brackets.\nAlthough the QoS states are not shown, the protocol operates by\nassigning more tickets to those paths which have a higher likeli-\nhood of satisfying the QoS constraints (delay or throughput).\nSource\n(1)\n(1)\n(2)\n(1)\n(3)\nDestination\nnFigure 5. A simple example of the operation of SIR and\nthroughput-guaranteed routing. A section of each node's time\nslot schedule is shown next to it. Dark shading indicates a slot\nused for transmission, and light shading, for reception. Unshad-\ned slots are used by other data sessions. In this example, the\nthroughput requirement of the source for its data session is two\ntime slots. The route discovery and time slot assignment phase is\nover and at the source, slots 1 and 2 have been assigned for\ntransmission. However, each of the two possible next hops have\nonly two slots spare, and one must be used for receiving  the\nsource's transmission. The two available paths are used to serve\nthe session's throughput requirement cooperatively, by dedicating\none time slot each to transmission. The labels P1 and P2 illus-\ntrate the fact that different transmission powers are used in each\ntime slot. As in previous TDMA examples, forwarding nodes\nmust be careful not to transmit in a slot in which their upstream\nnode is receiving.\nDestination Source\nP2\nP1\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

A route can\nbe calculated from the propagation map at each node, and its\nlifetime can be estimated. This approach shows huge potential\nfor practical multiconstraint QoS routing in the future. Fur-\nthermore, since link states are not used, there is no need to\nupdate several link states when a single node moves, as in\nother protocols. Instead, only that one node\u2019s state needs to\nbe updated in neighbors\u2019 state tables.\nDespite its many advantages, NSR also has several draw-\nbacks. First and foremost, it relies on accurate location\nawareness, which limits its usefulness to devices that are\ncapable of being equipped with GPS receivers or such. Sec-\nondly, as described in [34], throughput-constrained routing\ndepends on a TDMA-based MAC protocol for capacity reser-\nvation and throughput guarantees to be made. Thirdly, the\nnode state updating mechanism is necessarily proactive,\nwhich can incur a high overhead and result in poor scaling\nwith network size. However, the authors insist that flooding\nof states is avoided by propagating only a subset of states to\nfurther neighbors and only those that have changed by a\nthreshold.\nPROTOCOLS BASED ON CONTENDED MAC\nCORE EXTRACTION DISTRIBUTED AD HOC ROUTING\nThe Core Extraction Distributed Ad Hoc Routing (CEDAR)\nalgorithm was proposed in [41]. The basis for its name is the\ntopology management, core extraction mechanism at the algo-\nrithm\u2019s heart. The core of a network is defined as the mini-\nmum dominating set (MDS), that is, all nodes are either part\nof this set or have a neighbor that is part of the set (see Fig.\n6). The calculation of the MDS is a known NP-hard problem\n[41], hence the algorithm only finds an approximation of it.\nThe reason for calculating the MDS, or the set of core nodes,\nis to provide a routing backbone. This ensures that every node\ncan be reached, but not every node has to partake in route\ndiscovery. Non-core nodes save energy by not participating\nand this way protocol overhead is also reduced.\nFurthermore, local broadcasts are highly unreliable due to\nthe hidden and exposed node problems [41]. Within the core,\nreliable local unicasts may be used to propagate routing and\nQoS state information. This uses RTS-CTS handshaking to\navoid hidden and exposed node problems and to make sure\nthe \u201cbroadcast\u201d packet is delivered to every neighboring core\nnode. This scheme is termed core broadcast.\nIt was argued in [41] that using only local state for QoS rout-\ning incurs little overhead, but far from optimal routes may be\ncomputed, or in the worst case, no QoS route may be found,\neven if one exists. In the other extreme, gathering the whole net-\nwork state at each node incurs a very high overhead, but in the-\nory allows the computation of optimal paths, albeit with the\npossibility of using stale information. CEDAR compromises by\nkeeping up-to-date information at each core node about its local\ntopology, as well as the link-state information about relatively\nstable links with relatively high residual capacity further away.\nThis is done via increase and decrease waves. For every link,\nthe nodes at either end are responsible for monitoring the\navailable capacity on it and for notifying their dominators\nwhen it increases or decreases by a threshold value. The\nmethod of estimating available link capacity is not specified in\n[41]. In brief, increase and decrease waves carry notification by\ncore broadcast of an increase or decrease in available capacity\non a link, and the actual throughput achievable on it. They are\nprocessed such that increase waves travel slowly through the\nnetwork but decrease waves travel quickly. This avoids the\nproblem of nodes attempting to use link capacity that is no\nlonger available. Any nodes receiving either type of message\ncache the relevant link capacity information. Increase waves\nhave a time to live and are propagated as far as this allows.\nDecrease waves are only propagated further by nodes which\nhad previous knowledge of the corresponding link, thus ensur-\ning that the wave does not travel to parts of the network where\nit will be useless. If a link\u2019s capacity fluctuates, the fast-moving\ndecrease wave quickly overtakes the slower increase wave and\nthus, information about unstable links is kept local. High-\ncapacity stable link information is allowed to propagate far.\nWhen a source s requires a route to destination d, with\nrequired throughput b, it must request this from its domina-\ntor, which will either know, or discover routes to the domina-\ntor of d using a core-broadcast search. This establishes\nso-called core paths.\nWhen a QoS route is required, the shortest\u2013widest core\npath satisfying the achievable throughput requirement is\ndetermined using a two-phase Dijkstra algorithm. However,\nnodes only have link capacity information from a limited\nradius due to the wave propagation mechanism. Thus, the\nQoS core path is determined in stages with each node routing\nas far as it can \u201csee\u201d capacity information, then delegating the\nrest of the routing to the furthest \u201cseen\u201d node on the core\npath. This process iterates until the final destination is\nreached and all links satisfy the achievable throughput\nrequirement.\nThe greatest novelties of this technique were the core\nbroadcast and link capacity dissemination mechanisms. These\nensure efficient use of network resources and relatively accu-\nrate and up-to-date knowledge of the QoS state where it is\nrequired. Furthermore, this protocol does not rely on a\nTDMA network, as the protocols discussed in the previous\nsection do. However, the problem of estimating available link\ncapacities (achievable throughput) was left open.\nINTERFERENCE-AWARE QOS ROUTING\nIn [43] the authors consider throughput-constrained QoS\nrouting based on knowledge of the interference between links.\nnFigure 6. A simple example topology showing a possible core\nnetwork found by CEDAR. The shaded circles represent core\nnodes, while the unshaded ones stand for non-core nodes. The\ncore is set up by each node selecting a dominator from among\nits neighbours. The dominator is initially the neighbour node\nwith the highest degree of connectivity, whose identity is learned\nthrough beaconing. A node joins the core if it is selected by at\nleast one node as dominator. The core evolves as each node\nfinally selects the neighbour with the most dominatees to be its\ndominator. In this  gure, the arrows point from each node to its\ndominator.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on December 4, 2009 at 06:36 from IEEE Xplore.

The proposed solution operates by first\nrecording the channel usage (b\/s) of each existing data session\non each link. It is noted that the total channel usage of the\nsessions occupying the links within the same clique must not\nexceed the channel capacity. A link\u2019s residual capacity is then\ncalculated by subtracting the channel usage of all sessions on\nlinks in the same clique from the link\u2019s nominal capacity. This\nlink capacity information may then be used in any known dis-\ntributed ad hoc routing protocol to solve the throughput-con-\nstrained routing problem.\nUp until now, we have not discussed the heart of the prob-\nlem of achievable throughput estimation in a contended-\naccess network. This issue is the focus of work first presented\nin [12] and later published in [9].\nA simple frequency reuse pattern is assumed, as shown in\nFig. 7, wherein the carrier-sense range (cs-range) is twice the\nreception range. This means that if a node has a transmission\nrange of R meters, then any nodes at a distance of \u2264 2R\nmeters from it are within its carrier-sense range and vice\nversa. Nodes within the cs-range are termed cs-neighbors, and\nthis set of nodes is the cs-neighborhood. The cs-range = 2R\nmodel simulates the physical layer characteristics of network\nadapters which are able to sense the presence of a signal at a\nmuch greater range than that at which they are able to decode\nthe information it carries.\nIn a contention-based MAC protocol such as the 802.11 dis-\ntributed coordination function (DCF) [49], a node may only\ntransmit when it senses the channel idle. Therefore, any nodes\ntransmitting within its cs-range cause the channel to be busy and\nare thus in direct contention for channel access with it. This is\none of the key realizations in [9, 12]: all nodes in the cs-range\n(cs-neighbors) must be considered when estimating a node\u2019s\navailable channel capacity, that is, achievable throughput.\nMore specifically, in 802.11 the channel is deemed idle if\nboth the transmit and receive states are idle and no node\nwithin R has reserved the channel via the network allocation\nvector [12]. Knowing this, it is possible to statistically estimate\na node\u2019s available channel capacity by measuring the fraction\nof time for which a node detects the channel state as idle.\nA further major consideration in [12] is that nodes on a\npath carrying a data session interfere with each other as well.\nIn the worst case, where the path is at least six nodes long,\nnodes in the middle of the path have two transmitters\nupstream and two downstream contending for the channel\n(due to the \u201ccs-range = 2-hops\u201d model). This makes a total of\nfive nodes in contention, that is, the contention count is five.\nFor example, see Fig. 8, where a session requiring, say, 10 kb\/s\nis forwarded along the path {A, B, C, D, E, F}. Nodes A, B,\nD, and E all must forward data at 10 kb\/s to satisfy the ses-\nsion\u2019s requirements. Therefore, at node C, including its own\nchannel usage, 50 kb\/s channel capacity is consumed. This is\nfive times the session\u2019s nominal requirement, since the nodes\nare all contending for channel access with each other.\nIn [9, 12], the above considerations are used to extend an\non-demand source-routing protocol to achieve throughput-\nconstrained routing. Source routing is employed in order to\nbe able to pin a data session to a particular route, unlike pro-\ntocols such as AODV [50], which only store the next hop\ntowards the destination at each node. Moreover, knowing the\nentire route length allows the maximum contention count to\nbe easily calculated. However, since nodes share channel\ncapacity with their cs-neighbors, each node must check that\nevery single node in its cs-range has enough capacity to admit\na session. To visualize this, see Fig. 8, where node G\u2019s cs-\nrange is shown to encompass nodes B, C, and D. Therefore,\nG also falls in their cs-ranges. Continuing with the earlier\nexample, each of these nodes is forwarding 10 kb\/s, resulting\nin 30 kb\/s of channel capacity being consumed at node G,\neven though it is not part of the route. To check that nodes\nsuch as G can allow the session on path {A-G} to be admit-\nted, the cs-neighborhood of each node on the path is flooded\nwith an admission request that carries the entire route the ses-\nsion would take. Each node receiving the admission request\ncalculates the local capacity required by the session on the\nroute. An \u201cadmission request denied\u201d message is returned to\nthe requesting node if the local capacity is not sufficient.\nAnother similar, yet also important, approach is proposed\nin [13], where the authors consider contention among cs-\nneighbors (nodes in each other\u2019s cs-ranges) in a similar way to\n[9]. The \u201ccs-range = 2 hops\u201d model is adopted here also.\nHowever, instead of source routing, the contention-aware ses-\nsion admission mechanism is applied to AODV.\nThe algorithm for the residual channel capacity estimation\nrelies on AODV\u2019s HELLO message mechanism. Each node\nrecords how many bits it inputs into the channel every second\nand it piggybacks this information on its periodic HELLO\nmessages. Thus a node, say X, informs all of its neighbors of\nits channel usage. These neighbors propagate this information\nonto their neighbors (but only one hop) and thereby every\nnode in X\u2019s cs-range learns its channel usage. Conversely,\nsince all nodes implement this algorithm, X will know the\nchannel usage of all of its cs-neighbors. All that remains to be\ndone by X is to subtract the total channel usage of all these\nnodes from the raw channel capacity to obtain an estimate of\nthe amount of free channel capacity that is available to it at\nthat instant.\nThe major advantage of this protocol compared to the\nwork in [9] is that no extra control packets are introduced,\nsince bandwidth information is piggybacked on AODV\u2019s exist-\ning HELLO packets. However, one failing of this technique\nsurfaces as illustrated in Fig. 7: consider node B which is\ninside the cs-range of node A, but not inside the transmission\nradius of any of A\u2019s neighbors. Therefore, B cannot inform A\nof its channel usage, which therefore cannot be subtracted\nfrom A\u2019s available channel capacity.\nWhile the approaches discussed in this section represent\nsignificant progress in achievable throughput estimation and\nnFigure 7.

It is well known that as a\nnetwork nears saturation, ready-to-send and data packet colli-\nsions (in a multihop network) become more frequent, wasting\ncapacity. Additional capacity is wasted due to the 802.11 back-\noff algorithm, as the level of contention for the channel\nincreases. The protocols discussed in this section do not con-\nsider these sources of wastage when calculating the residual\ncapacity at each node. The need to include these factors has\nbeen recognized [51, 52]. In [52], we took a first step towards\nincorporating the effects of these factors in session admission\ncontrol, employing approximate estimations of collision and\nback-off wastage in our QoS routing protocol.\nCROSS-LAYER MULTICONSTRAINT QOS ROUTING\nAn approach proposed in [22] is the focus of this section. First\nof all, Fan proposes the MAC delay metric, which he defines\nas the time between a packet being received by the MAC pro-\ntocol from the higher layers, and an ACK being received for\nit, after it is transmitted. This includes the time deferred when\nawaiting channel access and is thus a useful metric for avoid-\ning busy links. Link reliability and throughput constraints are\nalso considered in [22], but they use pre-existing definitions\nand methods of calculation.\nThe focus of the article is on performing multiconstraint\nQoS routing with the aforementioned three metrics. Fan reit-\nerates the fact that the multiconstraint QoS routing problem\nis NP-complete [2] when a combination of additive and multi-\nplicative metrics is considered. Among the above metrics,\ndelay is additive, link reliability is multiplicative, and achiev-\nable throughput is concave. However, methods have been pro-\nposed (see [22] and references therein) for reducing this\nNP-complete problem to one that can be solved in polynomial\ntime. In one such method, all QoS metrics, except one, take\nbounded integer values.\nThen, the task of finding a path to satisfy all constraints\ncan be performed by a modified Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm. In [22],\nthe multiplicative metric is reduced to an additive one by tak-\ning the logarithm of the reliability percentage of a link. Also,\nthe delay metric is reduced such that each link is represented\nby the percentage of the allowable total delay it introduces.\nThe resulting problem in the new metric space can be solved\nin polynomial time. Then, a modified Bellman\u2013Ford or Dijk-\nstra\u2019s algorithm with the new reliability metric for link weights\ncan be used to find an approximation to the optimal path. In\neach iteration, the total MAC delay along a path is checked\nand also paths which do not satisfy the channel capacity con-\nstraint are eliminated (see [22] for the exact algorithm used).\nAn obvious advantage of this approach is the concurrent\nconsideration of several important QoS metrics in path selec-\ntion. However, the QoS state for all paths must be discovered\nand kept fresh. This incurs extra overhead and the details of\nthis mechanism are not discussed in [22]. Furthermore, as we\nhave seen, such a protocol requires the presence of other\nmechanisms to actually measure the link reliability, MAC\ndelay, and available channel capacity values at each node.\nON-DEMAND DELAY-CONSTRAINED\nUNICAST ROUTING PROTOCOL\nA proposal in [35] focuses on providing delay-constrained\nroutes for data sessions. The key features of this protocol are\nas follows. Firstly, a proactive distance vector algorithm is\nemployed to establish and maintain routing tables containing\nthe distance and next hop along the shortest path to each des-\ntination node. When a delay-constrained path is required, this\ninformation is used to send a probe to the destination along\nthe shortest path to test its suitability. If this path satisfies the\nmaximum delay constraint, the destination returns an ACK\npacket to the source, which reserves resources. For this pur-\npose a resource reserving MAC protocol is assumed.\nIf the minimum hop path does not satisfy the delay con-\nstraint, the destination initiates a directed and limited flood\nsearch by broadcasting a RReq packet. Intermediate nodes\nforward the RReq if the total of their respective distances\nfrom the destination and source is below a set threshold and if\nthe path delay is below the delay constraint value. When a\ncopy of the RReq reaches the source with a path that meets\nthe delay constraint, the route discovery process is complete.\nWhile this protocol aims to minimize the hop distance\nbetween source and destination and discovers paths that satis-\nfy a session\u2019s delay constraint, it has some major drawbacks.\nFirstly, while the aim of the directed flooding is to avoid glob-\nal flooding, thereby reducing overhead compared to protocols\nbased on that, extra overhead is incurred by the proactive dis-\ntance-vector protocol which maintains the routing tables. Sec-\nondly, in [35] the existence of a resource reserving MAC is\nsimply assumed. However, the authors do not discuss what\nkind of resources they wish to reserve and how this is to be\nachieved. Reserving channel capacity for example, is problem-\natic, as previously discussed.\nQOS GREEDY PERIMETER STATELESS ROUTING FOR\nULTRA-WIDEBAND MANETS\nA recent proposal [18] at the time of this writing highlights a\nrelatively new direction for MANETs: that of employing an\nultra-wideband (UWB) physical layer. One of the advantages\nof UWB is that it allows a node\u2019s position to be estimated via\ntriangulation techniques. This provides location information,\nwithout having to rely on GPS, for enabling a position-based\nrouting protocol. The proposal in [18] extends an older proto-\nnFigure 8.

We refer to this proposal as QGUM, meaning \u201cQoS\nGPSR for UWB MANETs.\u201d\nIn brief, each node broadcasts beacons containing its ID\nand position to all of its neighbor nodes. The destination\u2019s\nposition is learned at the same time as its ID. When a route\nis required, the source node sends a RReq to the neighbor\nnode which is closest to the destination. The RReq specifies,\namong other information, the requesting data session\u2019s total\ndelay bound, its PLR constraint, and the accumulated PLR\nso far.\nA node receiving the RReq factors in its own PLR and\ncompares the result with the PLR bound. If it is unacceptable,\na Route Failure is sent back to the source node. In this case,\nthe source node begins route discovery again, starting with a\ndifferent node in its neighbor list. If the PLR bound is not\nexceeded, the intermediate node appends its ID to the RReq,\nin a manner akin to other source-routing protocols. It also\nadds its location before performing the same procedure as the\nsource to find the next node to forward the RReq to. Each\nintermediate node performs the PLR checks and passes the\nRReq to the neighbor closest to the destination, until the des-\ntination receives the RReq.\nThe above procedure describes route discovery. We now\nsummarize the method for ensuring QoS on routes. First of\nall, [18] suggests that QGUM can operate with either a con-\ntended MAC protocol, similar to the 802.11 DCF, or with a\nTDMA-based protocol such as 802.15.3 [46]. In the former\ncase, available channel capacity is determined in the same way\nas in [9], described in the subsection \u201cInterference-Aware\nQoS Routing\u201d above, using channel idleness ratio estimation.\nIn the latter, timeslots quantify channel capacity. However, as\ndetailed above at the end of the subsection \u201cQoS Routing in a\nCDMA over TDMA Network,\u201d we do not believe 802.15.3 is\nthe ideal solution for multihop MANETs. Therefore, we focus\non the contended MAC-based algorithm.\nAfter a route to the destination is discovered as detailed\nabove, the session admission control procedure begins. Owing\nto the available position information, the destination can cal-\nculate which nodes on the route are inside each other\u2019s cs-\nranges and thus which can transmit simultaneously. The\ndestination then calculates the channel capacity required at\neach node for the data session to be admitted. It then sends\nan admission request (AdReq) back along the route. Each\nintermediate node checks its locally available capacity and the\ncapacity of its cs-neighbors by flooding an AdReq, similar to\nthe protocol in [9], as described above. If the intermediate\nnode and all its cs-neighbors have sufficient capacity, they\ntemporarily reserve the necessary capacity for the session and\nthe AdReq is forwarded to the next hop in the route back\ntowards the source node.\nIf any nodes or their cs-neighbors on the route have insuf-\nficient capacity, they generate an admission refused message.\nIn essence this is passed to the next hop on the route towards\nthe source, which invokes a path repair mechanism. This\noperates very similarly to the route discovery procedure,\nexcept only a partial new path must be discovered starting\nfrom the node before the one which had insufficient capacity.\nThe main advantages of QGUM compared to earlier similar\napproaches described above are as follows:\n\u2022 Exploitation of the multirate capability of the UWB phys-\nical layer\n\u2022 Exploitation of the location information provided by the\nUWB physical layer, enabling directed route discovery\n\u2022 Simultaneous satisfaction of an application\u2019s PLR and\nthroughput requirements (delay can be considered\ninstead of throughput)\nHowever, these advantages must be balanced against the typi-\ncally shorter range offered by UWB radios. For example,\nwhile UWB provides higher data rates than existing variants\nof 802.11x, the approximate range for the proposed UWB\n802.15.3a specification is only 10 m at 110 Mb\/s [53]. Indeed,\ncurrent standardization efforts involving UWB radio technolo-\ngies for wireless networks are targeted at personal area net-\nworks [54] and not larger-scale ad hoc WLANs as 802.11x is.\nThis limits the applicability of protocols based on a UWB\nphysical layer. \nPROTOCOLS INDEPENDENT OF THE\nTYPE OF MAC\nQOS OPTIMIZED LINK STATE ROUTING\nA QoS routing protocol based on Optimized Link State Rout-\ning (OLSR) [55] was presented in [44]. OLSR is a proactive\nprotocol in which information about 1-hop and 2-hop neigh-\nbors is maintained in each node\u2019s routing table. This informa-\ntion is disseminated via periodically broadcast HELLO\nmessages. OLSR minimizes the control overhead involved in\nflooding routing information by employing only a subset of\nnodes, termed multipoint relays (MPRs), to rebroadcast it. As\na consequence, only MPRs are discovered during route dis-\ncovery and thus only they are used as intermediate nodes on\nroutes. Also, calculating the optimal MPR set to reach all 2-\nhop neighbors is an NP-complete problem and therefore\nheuristics are applied.\nSince only a subset of nodes are MPRs, the best links (as\ndefined by some QoS metrics) may not be utilized for routing.\nIn QoS-OLSR (QOLSR) [44], this problem is solved by\nproposing new heuristics for building nodes\u2019 MPR sets in\norder to enable QoS routing to take place. QOLSR employs\nboth a variation on the MAC delay metric and the achievable\nthroughput metric for QoS routing.\nIn contrast to many of the protocols discussed so far,\nalthough the analysis in [44] is based on the 802.11 MAC,\nQOLSR does not rely on the MAC protocol to provide resid-\nual channel capacity or delay information. These values are\nestimated statistically, using the periodic HELLO messages, as\nfollows. The total expected MAC delay of a packet is a prod-\nuct of the average estimated delay or expected service time\n(EST) of one packet and the total number of packets awaiting\ntransmission. The value of EST in turn depends on packets\u2019\ntransmission times and the expected number of retransmis-\nsions the MAC layer will have to perform (i.e., frame error\nratio or FER). The FER is approximated by taking the ratio\nof the number of HELLO messages received during a moni-\ntoring window to the number expected, which is calculated\nfrom the known HELLO sending rate. The FER provides an\nestimate of the number of retransmissions required for suc-\ncessful delivery of a data packet.\nThe transmission delay of a packet depends on the amount\nof time a node spends backing off and resolving collisions. A\ndetailed analysis in [44] shows that this is a function of the\naverage backoff window size and the FER. Using these, the\nderived formulae yield an estimation for the EST of each\npacket and therefore the total MAC delay of a link between a\nnode and its neighbor.\nThe achievable throughput of a link is also calculated\nstatistically. The MAC delay or EST of a packet is estimat-\ned as described above. Using this, and knowledge of the\noverhead posed by packet headers and MAC control\nframes, the throughput experienced by packets can be esti-\nmated.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Queuing delay is estimated from the\ndelay between passing a packet to the MAC protocol and\nreceiving a \u201csent\u201d notification, after subtracting the estimated\ntime consumed by contention resolution and retransmissions.\nIf there is no queuing delay, the queue is deemed empty. In\nthis case, the elapsed time since the last notification was\nreceived, is considered the link\u2019s idle time. The total of this\nidle time as a fraction of the monitoring period is multiplied\nby the average throughput of a packet, to provide the estimate\nfor residual channel capacity.\nFinally, [44] details how nodes\u2019 MPR sets are constructed\nusing the link capacity and delay information. It is claimed\nthat the proposed heuristic selects the appropriate MPRs at\neach node in order to ensure that nodes are connected via the\nhighest residual capacity and lowest delay paths.\nIn summary, QOLSR appears to be a promising proactive\nQoS routing protocol for finding and maintaining the short-\nest-widest paths in terms of delay and throughput. It also ben-\nefits from the characteristic lower overhead (compared to\nearlier proactive protocols) of OLSR, due to the use of\nMPRs. While QOLSR does not rely on the use of lower layer\ninformation directly, it does require notifications to be sent by\nthe MAC protocol in order to calculate QoS metrics. Avoid-\ning complicated MAC-routing interactions is a bonus, but the\nachievable QoS estimations are inherently not as accurate as\nwith MAC layer idle-time estimation.\nLINK STABILITY-BASED ROUTING\nIn [21], link stability is considered as an important QoS met-\nric. Stability is defined as the expected lifetime of a link,\nwhich is largely dependent on the node movement pattern\n[21]. The article presents the probability distribution functions\n(PDF) of link lifetimes under various node movement models.\nThe remaining link lifetime is estimated as the area under the\nPDF for a given mobility model, taken between the link\u2019s\nmeasured lifetime so far, and infinity. For example, in the ran-\ndom destination mobility model, nodes do not change direc-\ntion after selecting a destination, until they reach it. This\nmobility model was found to produce a link lifetime PDF sim-\nilar to a Rayleigh distribution [21]. To find the probability\nthat a link\u2019s remaining lifetime is greater than a time t, the\nPDF of the link lifetime is integrated between t + Lp and\ninfinity, where Lp is the link\u2019s past lifetime.\nA link lifetime model such as the one above is proposed\nfor each of a selection of mobility models. An application may\nspecify a lower limit for acceptable path failure probability,\nPfail. This value can be calculated based on a data session\u2019s\ndelay, delay jitter, and packet loss rate requirements.\nIt was proposed [21] that this mechanism be combined\nwith AODV for QoS routing. The value Pfail is inserted into\nRReq packets. Intermediate nodes test that the cumulative\nfailure probability of links up to that point (also stored in the\nRReq and updated by each node) is not greater than Pfail:\nTherefore, using an appropriate model such as the above and\ngiven the data session\u2019s duration, it is possible to calculate the\nprobability of a path remaining intact for the duration of the\ndata session, Psurvive. If this is unacceptable, that is, Psurvive <\nPfail, then the session is not admitted.\nThis simple mechanism could be useful for statistically pre-\ndicting link lifetimes and therefore avoiding links and paths\nthat have a high probability of failure while a session is active.\nAn obvious difficulty with this approach is that the node\nmobility pattern must be known and must be modeled accu-\nrately for the lifetime estimation to be useful. However, com-\nbined with other stability metrics, as discussed below, this\ncould be a useful component of a more sophisticated QoS\nprovisioning mechanism.\nAnother approach that considers link and path stability as\nan important QoS metric is presented in [42]. A new variation\non the stability metric is introduced in the form of the entropy\nmetric. This is defined for a link as a function of the relative\npositions and velocities, and the transmission ranges of the\nlink\u2019s two end nodes. A path\u2019s entropy is defined as the prod-\nuct of the link entropies along it. The lower the entropy, the\nhigher the path stability.\nThis scheme is incorporated into a source-routed scheme\nsomewhat akin to DSR, and during route discovery, the path\nentropy (among other metrics) is calculated. A destination\nreceives RReqs over multiple paths and waits a specified\ninterval after receiving the first one, before selecting the path\nwith the lowest entropy, that is, highest stability. This route is\nreturned to the source in the RRep, thereby completing the\nroute discovery.\nThis approach has the potential to be more accurate than\nthat in [21], since it considers nodes\u2019 relative positions and\nvelocities for calculating the probability of link failure, rather\nthan just a general PDF for a given mobility model. However,\nthis comes at the price of assuming that each node is capable\nof determining its position via GPS or some similar system\n[42].\nHYBRID AD HOC ROUTING PROTOCOL\nThe Hybrid Ad hoc Routing Protocol (HARP) is introduced\nin [25]. It uses the notion of quality of connectivity (QoC) as\nits routing metric. This is defined as a function of two node\nstates: residual buffer space and relative stability. The latter is\ndefined for node x over a chosen period of time, t1 \u2013 t0, as:\nwhere Nt0 and Nt1 are the set of neighbors of x at times t0 and\nt1, respectively. Thus, stability is greater, the fewer the number\nof neighbor nodes that change between t0 and t1. The higher a\nnode\u2019s residual buffer space and relative stability, the better\nthe QoC to it is.\nThe QoC of each node is used in a logical topology con-\nstruction algorithm. Each node periodically broadcasts a bea-\ncon to all of its neighbors, which contains its address and QoC.\nThen, each node selects as its preferred neighbor (PN) the\nneighbor node with the highest QoC. A link between a node\nand its PN is called a preferred link. A logical tree is construct-\ned by connecting nodes together using only preferred links. A\ntree\u2019s growth terminates where a node\u2019s preferred link is with\na node that is already part of the tree. This heuristic has been\nproven to yield a forest of trees [25]. In brief, each tree is then\nconsidered a routing zone, within which proactive routing\noccurs. Interzone routing is performed on-demand, and hence\nthe hybrid route discovery of this protocol.\nIn interzone routing, other zones may be abstracted as\nnodes, thus a packet can be routed to another zone, and on\narrival, the intrazone routing mechanism can direct the packet\nto its final destination.\nHARP also includes route discovery optimizations which\nreduce overhead. Firstly, the forest structure can be used to\navoid having to flood route request (RReq) packets used in\ninterzone routing. This is done by forwarding RReqs only via\ngateway nodes; a node is considered to be a gateway, if it is\nthe neighbor of a leaf node, but it is in another zone.\nstab x\nN N\nN N\nt t\nt t\n( ) = \u2229\n\u222a\n0 1\n0 1\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Restrictions apply. \nIEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials \u2022 2nd Quarter 200766\nSecondly, features of the relative distance micro-discovery\nrouting protocol (RDMAR) [56] are incorporated into HARP.\nRDMAR does not limit the number of neighbors propagating\na flooded packet, but limits the scope of the flooding instead.\nThus, RReqs do not propagate to areas of the network where\nthey will be useless, thereby wasting resources.\nThe time-to-live (TTL) field in a RReq is set based on an\nestimation of the relative distance of the destination in terms\nof hops. However, the estimation can only be made if there is\nsome previous knowledge of the destination, and a replace-\nment path to it is sought, that is, this is not the first search. In\nthis case, the relative stabilities of each node on the path,\ncombined with the time elapsed since the stabilities were\nrecorded, yields an estimation for the total maximum change\nin the positions of the nodes on the path. This is added to the\nprevious known distance in meters (hops \u00d7 radio range) of the\ndestination. The sum is divided by the radio range to obtain\nan estimated upper bound on the distance of the destination\nin number of hops. This value is used for the TTL.\nA further enhancement to RDMAR in HARP, is that\nintermediate nodes may make their own estimation for the\ndistance to the destination. If this is higher than the original\nestimation, it implies that the destination does not lie in this\ndirection from the source. In this case, the RReq is not propa-\ngated further, meaning that it does not travel to areas of the\nnetwork where the destination surely does not lie.\nHARP\u2019s use of the QoC metric allows it to discover routes\nthat have fewer buffered packets and which are relatively sta-\nble. This results in lower average delay and fewer mid-session\nroute failures, potentially yielding a lower session dropping\nrate. Additionally, QoC-based routing produces a load-balanc-\ning effect, which avoids congestion and early battery drainage\nof any single node, thereby delaying network partitioning.\nOn the downside, HARP does not consider an applica-\ntion\u2019s particular requirements, it aims only to improve average\npacket delay and network lifetime and to reduce the chance\nof route failure during a data session. Moreover, the beacon-\ning process results in higher routing overhead compared to\npurely reactive protocols such as DSR.\nDELAY-SENSITIVE ADAPTIVE ROUTING PROTOCOL\nThe Delay-Sensitive Adaptive Routing Protocol (DSARP)\n[19] employs reactive route discovery, is completely decoupled\nfrom the MAC protocol, and provides delay guarantees for\ntime-sensitive data sessions. Its basic operation is very similar\nto classical reactive MANET routing protocols such as DSR.\nHowever, when a path is required for delay-sensitive traffic, a\ndifferent algorithm is employed.\nThe source node sends a route request (RReq), as usual.\nThis is allowed to propagate to the destination, which sends a\nroute reply (RRep). When forwarding the RRep, each inter-\nmediate node on the path attaches the number of packets\nawaiting transmission in its buffer. Multiple RReps may be\nreceived by the source node, which then selects several short-\nest paths, if there are multiple. Alternatively, the shortest path\nplus the next shortest path are selected. Using the information\nabout buffer usage at each node, the source calculates the total\nnumber of packets on each selected path. Finally, the traffic\nflow on each path is adjusted such that the new traffic allocat-\ned to it is greater if the existing traffic on it is lower and the\nnumber of packets on other paths is greater. This algorithm\npushes the network towards a state where each path has an\nequal flow of traffic on it and thus is likely to produce the\nsame packet delay. Essentially, this implements a form of load-\nbalancing, ensuring that the energy usage of nodes is also dis-\ntributed evenly. After adjusting the traffic on each path, a\nstatistical guarantee can be made about the delay on that path.\nDSARP is simple to implement and provides delay guaran-\ntees without relying on the MAC protocol, but has the follow-\ning disadvantages. The number of buffered packets on each\npath must be rediscovered each time a new session begins,\nregardless of whether the route has failed or not. This incurs\nextra overhead. Also, the delay guarantees may fail in the face\nof mobility, if other nodes move into contention range and\ncause greater channel access delays for nodes on a session\u2019s\npath.\nAPPLICATION-AWARE QOS ROUTING\nA rather unique approach to QoS routing is presented in [17].\nIt is unique because instead of using lower layer (MAC) infor-\nmation, it is based on the aid of the transport layer. The pro-\nposal, referred to as Application Aware QoS Routing (AAQR)\nin the literature, assumes the use of the real-time transport\nprotocol (RTP) [57]. The delay between two nodes is estimat-\ned statistically by examining the difference between time\nstamps on transmission and receipt of RTP packets between\nthose two nodes. The delay variance is also calculated. Fur-\nthermore, each node records the throughput requirement of\nRTP sessions which are flowing through it. Subtracting the\ntotal of these throughput values from the raw channel capacity\ngives an estimate for the total remaining capacity at that node.\nWhen a QoS-route is required, applications may specify\nthroughput and delay constraints. In [17] delay is considered\nthe most important constraint for multimedia applications.\nRoutes are discovered on-demand, although the details of the\nroute-discovery procedure are not discussed. A subset of the\ndiscovered routes is selected, such that all paths satisfy the\ndelay constraint of the application. From this subset a further\nsubset of routes is selected, which also satisfy the application\u2019s\nthroughput constraint. Finally, from this second subset, the\nroute with the lowest variance in RTP packet transmission\ndelays, is chosen. If there are no routes that meet the through-\nput requirement, the route with the highest available channel\ncapacity, which satisfies the delay constraint, is selected.\nA major advantage of AAQR is that no extra overhead is\nincurred for QoS routing, since the existing transport layer\npackets are used for QoS metric estimation. Additionally,\nboth delay and throughput constraints may be considered.\nHowever, the use of RTP is assumed, and therefore the range\nof application scenarios for this protocol is obviously limited.\nGENETIC ALGORITHM-BASED QOS ROUTING\nIn [24], a Genetic Algorithm-based source-routing protocol\nfor MANETs (GAMAN) is proposed, which uses end-to-end\ndelay and transmission success ratio for QoS metrics. Genetic\nalgorithms (GAs) may be employed for heuristically approxi-\nmating an optimal solution to a problem, in this case finding\nthe optimal route based on the two QoS constraints men-\ntioned.\nThe first stage of the process involves encoding routes so\nthat a GA can be applied; this is termed gene coding. For this\npurpose, paths are discovered on-demand and then a network\ntopology view is constructed in a logical tree-like structure.\nEach node stores a tree routed at itself with its neighbor\nnodes as child nodes and in turn their neighbor nodes as their\nchildren. Tree reductions are used to avoid duplicate subtrees\n(see [24]). Each tree junction is considered a gene and multi-\nple genes make up a chromosome which represents a path.\nThe route discovery algorithm is assumed to collect locally\ncomputed metrics such as average delay over a link and the link\nreliability for the links on each path. After the gene encoding\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on December 4, 2009 at 06:36 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nIEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials \u2022 2nd Quarter 2007 67\nstage, the fitness T of each path is calculated as follows:\nwhere Di and Ri are the delay and reliability of link i,\nrespectably. The fitness values are used to select paths for\ncross-over breeding and mutation operations. The fittest path\n(with the smallest T) and the offspring from the genetic oper-\nations are carried forward into the next generation.\nWhile this method is a useful heuristic for approximating the\noptimal value over the delay and link reliability metrics at the\nsame time, it requires many paths to be searched in order to\ncollect enough \u201cgenetic information\u201d for the GA operations to\nbe meaningful. This means that the method is not suited to\nlarge networks, as the authors themselves admit [24]. The meth-\nods of calculating Di and Ri are not detailed, but we assume they\ncan be calculated statistically by the end nodes of each link.\nCollecting and maintaining sufficient route and QoS state\ninformation in order to make a GA useful for QoS routing is\ncostly in terms of both overhead and energy consumption.\nHowever, heuristic methods are often the only feasible way of\nsolving NP-complete multiconstraint multihop QoS routing\nproblems. Thus, while their general applicability to MANETs\nis limited, GAs may play a niche role in finding near-optimal\nroutes, while satisfying multiple QoS constraints in certain\nenvironments. For example, MANETs which are less power-\nconstrained and experience lower levels of mobility, and\/or\nMANETs having topologies where a relatively small number\nof nodes can be combined in a relatively large number of ways\nto construct valid routes. The GAMAN protocol discussed in\nthis section provides an exploratory example of how GAs may\npossibly be applied in such networks.\nENERGY- AND RELIABILITY-AWARE ROUTING\nThe Maximum Residual Packet Capacity (MRPC) protocol is\nproposed in [23], which considers battery charge as well as\nlink reliability during route selection. Admittedly, MRPC is\nnot intended to be a QoS routing protocol, but we consider it\nhere since it utilizes some QoS-related metrics to improve all-\nround QoS. Routing based on residual battery charge is con-\nsidered extensively in the literature [33]. However, in our\nview, protocols that consider only this state are not useful for\nQoS routing, since they do not improve the QoS experienced\nby individual data sessions or packets. On the other hand,\nMRPC also considers link reliability, as detailed below.\nIn [23] a node-link metric is introduced to capture the\nenergy lifetime of a link between nodes i (transmitter) and j,\nwhich is defined as:\nwhere Ri is the residual battery charge at node i and Ei,j is the\nenergy required to transmit a data packet of a given size over\nthe link (i, j). A suggested formulation for Ei,j is as follows:\nwhere Ti,j is the energy required for one transmission attempt\nof the aforementioned data packet with a fixed transmission\npower. Also, pi,j is the packet error probability of the link (i, j)\nand H = 1 if hop-by-hop retransmissions are performed by\nthe link layer. From the above formulas, it is clear that the\nlifetime of a link is higher when greater battery charge\nremains at the transmitter node and when the reliability of the\nlink is high, resulting   in a low energy cost for correctly trans-\nmitting a packet. These formulas give an estimation for the\nexpected number of data packets that can be transmitted over\na link before the battery of the transmitter fails [23]. Then, if\na route failure is said to occur when any single link on it fails,\nthe lifetime of path p in number of packets is simply:\nMRPC considers the best route to be the one with the\ngreatest residual lifetime. In [23], it was suggested that the\nMRPC algorithm be implemented in AODV [50] for applica-\ntion in MANETs. As routes are discovered, the lifetime of the\npath is accumulated by calculating the lifetime of each link.\nThe next hop to a destination is always selected to be the\nneighbor which results in the greatest possible value for Lifep.\nThis protocol results not only in load balancing, increasing\nthe life of the network and avoiding congestion, but also\nyields closer-to-optimal energy consumption per packet, as\nwell as lower packet delay and packet loss probability, due to\nthe preference for more reliable links. It can also be imple-\nmented in an on-demand fully distributed routing protocol,\nsuch as AODV. However, link reliabilities must somehow be\nestimated, which may nsot be a trivial problem. Furthermore,\nlike HARP, MRPC does not cater to particular sessions\u2019\nrequirements, only fosters better all-round QoS, and hence\nmay be unsuitable for many applications. On the other hand,\nas mentioned above, MRPC is not primarily intended to be a\nQoS routing protocol, rather an energy-efficient best effort\nprotocol.\nTRENDS AND PROGRESS IN THE FIELD\nAs discussed above, many of the earlier QoS routing propos-\nals (pre-2000) for MANETs were based on contention-free\nMAC protocols and relied on either TDMA or\nTDMA\/CDMA channel access mechanisms. This was proba-\nbly due to their well-understood nature from the field of cel-\nlular communications. A TDMA approach offers a\nstraightforward method of quantifying channel capacity and\naccess opportunities, as well as allowing such opportunities to\nbe deterministically reserved for particular application data\nsessions. This enables throughput guarantees to be made, pro-\nvided that the network dynamics do not invalidate them. Due\nto mobility, as well as the unpredictable nature of the wireless\nchannel, truly hard guarantees can never be made in a\nMANET.\nEven though some newer proposals continue to assume\nTDMA, we (and others [9]) believe that nonhierarchical\nTDMA-based methods are practically highly unfeasible in\nMANETs, since time-slotting requires global clock synchro-\nnization, which is difficult to achieve in a mobile environment.\nA further drawback of this approach is the high signaling\noverhead incurred by slot scheduling and the potential com-\nplexities thereof [40].\nNewer MAC protocols such as that specified by 802.15.3\n[46] offer feasible TDMA solutions for MANETs by introduc-\ning node hierarchies whereby a group of nodes in a piconet is\nsynchronized by a central controller node. However, this pro-\ntocol is designed only for personal area networks and not for\nlarge-scale multihop MANETs.

In light of these conclusions, we\nbelieve, as previously stated, that QoS routing methods that\nrely on such channel access methods are not ideal for general,\nand especially larger-scale MANETs.\nThis is reflected in the literature, since the majority of later\nsolutions (post-2000), are based on contended MAC protocols\n(generally 802.11) or do not rely on any set channel access\nmechanism to be in place. Previously, we discussed several\nproposals relying on a contended MAC protocol, such as\n802.11. Many less mature solutions in this category did not\nconsider the nature of contention between neighboring nodes\nsufficiently accurately and thus reliable QoS provisioning did\nnot become a reality for MANETs. It was through key works\nsuch as [9, 13], that the nature of contention and its effect on\n(primarily throughput-constrained) QoS routing, begun to be\nwell-understood. Other newer proposals take this understand-\ning as a basis for further QoS routing designs. Proposals such\nas those discussed earlier greatly further the field of QoS ses-\nsion admission control. This was one of the areas identified as\nfuture work in previous surveys discussed above.\nMany solutions continue to be based upon 802.11x and its\nCSMA\/CA-based channel access mechanism. Even though\n802.11 is an aging standard, the CSMA\/CA mechanism has\nsurvived into its most recent versions and therefore proposals\nbased on the 802.11 MAC protocol continue to be very rele-\nvant. On the other hand, QoS routing proposals based on an\nultra-wideband physical layer (for example, [18]) are emerg-\ning. As we discussed above though, UWB radios have a limit-\ning shorter range compared to 802.11x. Accordingly, current\nUWB standardization efforts are all aimed at personal area\nnetworks, meaning that UWB-based QoS routing proposals\nhave limited applicability to small-scale MANETs only.\nStatistical QoS Protocols that make no assumptions about\nthe MAC layer have also received greater attention in the last\nfive years. Such protocols allow a simpler modular network\nstack design, without the complications of cross-layer issues.\nHowever, no guaranteed level of service is provided, as we\nsaw in the proposals discussed above. Instead, such protocols\ngenerally improve the all-around average QoS experienced by\npackets under some metrics, at the expense of other perfor-\nmance metrics or increased complexity or overhead. Such pro-\ntocols may not be sufficient for supporting applications with\nstringent QoS requirements. By contrast, protocols in this cat-\negory have done much to improve QoS robustness to failures,\nwhich was another area identified as future work in previous\nsurveys. The link and node stability-based techniques that\nwere summarized earlier can find longer-lasting routes and\nthus improve the robustness of QoS solutions against failures\ncaused by mobility. \nIn summary, we can say that there is a trend for QoS rout-\ning solutions to move away from contention-free MAC depen-\ndence and towards contended-MAC dependence for\nthroughput-constrained applications. To cater for many other\nmetrics, such as delay and PLR, numerous statistical protocols\nwhich are independent of the MAC layer, have been pro-\nposed.\nAnother aspect of development considers the metrics\nthemselves. Again, in the earlier proposals, the focus was on\nproviding an assured throughput service only, since through-\nput was deemed the most important requirement. Some earli-\ner protocols could serve, for example, either a throughput or a\ndelay requirement, but not both simultaneously. In this con-\ntext, the trend we observe has been to move from single-con-\nstraint routing to multiconstraint routing, as demonstrated by\nthe later proposals we have discussed. However, multicon-\nstraint routing remains an NP-complete problem ([2, 48]) and\nthus most of the described solutions do not aim to find opti-\nmal routes. Instead, they simply apply multiple metrics to\nroute filtering, removing all that do not satisfy a particular\nconstraint. One exception was described, in which a genetic\nalgorithm is employed as an heuristic to finding the optimal\nroute based on more than one metric.\nFUTURE WORK\nFollowing the work summarized above, we believe that there\nis still a way to go in the area of throughput-constrained rout-\ning, before perfect SAC is achieved, even in a low-mobility\nscenario. Works such as [9, 13] consider channel contention,\nas well as MAC overheads in achievable throughput estima-\ntion, but the time wasted due to deferring transmission, ran-\ndom back-off, and collisions has not been considered. The\nwastage due to collisions is especially difficult to calculate in a\nmultihop environment. This is important future work, if accu-\nrate residual channel capacity estimation is to be realized with\ncontented MAC. The understanding of contention among\nnodes also needs to be transferred to considerations of other\nQoS metrics, such as end-to-end packet delay, which is affect-\ned by the queues of all nodes within contention range [34].\nDelay jitter and energy consumption (due to collisions), are\nalso affected. Quantifying the impact on these metrics and\nmore, in the light of contention awareness and collisions,\ndesigning routing protocols that incorporate this knowledge\nand evaluating them with realistic application layer models, is\nall future work.\nA further trend that we have observed is that many design-\ners place great emphasis on the session admission (QoS route\nfinding) capability of their protocol, which is admittedly very\nimportant. In contrast, they often neglect or downplay the\nimportance of session completion, that is, maintaining the\nroutes and the QoS for as long as an application data session\nrequires. An aspect of this, QoS robustness, was highlighted\nby earlier survey writers. However, more work on the evalua-\ntion of QoS-sensitive session completion performance with\nrealistic application layers, would be useful. Ultimately, ses-\nsion completion is more important from a user perspective,\nthan session admission. This is because the perceived QoS is\nbetter when some sessions are blocked but none are dropped\nmid-session, rather than all sessions being admitted, but some\nfailing. Furthermore, fast local QoS route-repairing schemes\nrequire additional investigation to improve QoS session com-\npletion rates and protocols\u2019 robustness against mobility.\nPreviously we reiterated that one of the major challenges\nto the provision of QoS in MANETS is the unreliable wireless\nchannel. However, we have found that the majority of QoS\nrouting protocol evaluation studies assume a perfect physical\nchannel, ignoring the effects of shadowing and multipath fad-\ning. Therefore, studying the impact of a more realistic physi-\ncal layer model on QoS routing protocol performance is\nanother interesting area of future work.\nAs mentioned in the previous section, while simple multi-\nconstraint QoS routing proposals are numerous, there are few\nthat attempt to optimize multiconstraint routing. One example\nwas based on genetic algorithms [24]. However, such methods\nhave limited applicability due to the overhead and energy cost\nof collecting enough state information. Accurate studies are\nrequired to establish, with various networking environments\nand topologies, whether or not it is feasible to collect and\nmaintain sufficient state information to apply methods such as\nGAs. For the cases where it is, more research is required on\ndifferent types of heuristic algorithms for calculating near-\noptimal paths with multiple QoS constraints. Comparative\nstudies on the performance and impact of the heuristics, are\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on December 4, 2009 at 06:36 from IEEE Xplore.

Moreover, there is a distinct lack of\nprotocol frameworks for incorporating such methods into\npractically realizable systems. One promising, but perhaps not\nyet mature or feasible, approach is that of Node State Rout-\ning [34], which we discussed above. Such a solution would\nprovide the mechanism by which to disseminate the informa-\ntion to enable multiconstraint QoS routing.\nSUMMARY\nIn this article we reviewed the challenges to and basic con-\ncepts behind QoS routing in MANETs and provided a thor-\nough overview of QoS routing metrics and design\nconsiderations. We then classified many of the major contri-\nbutions to the QoS routing solutions pool published in the\nperiod 1997\u20132006. The protocols were selected in such a way\nas to highlight many different approaches to QoS routing in\nMANETs, while simultaneously covering most of the impor-\ntant advances in the field since the last such survey was pub-\nlished. We summarized the operation, strengths, and\ndrawbacks of these protocols in order to enunciate the variety\nof approaches proposed and to expose the trends in designers\u2019\nthinking. The protocols\u2019 interactions with the MAC layer were\nalso described. Finally, we provided an overview of the areas\nand trends of progress in the field and identified topics for\nfuture research.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.
