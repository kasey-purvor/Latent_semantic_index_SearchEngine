All rights reserved.1. Introduction\nMany commentators have observed that an increasingly signif-\nicant force in the welfare systems of most modern developed\nsocieties is that of consumerism.1 Broadly this term refers to a view\nof public services as commodities, and increasing attention being\npaid to protecting and satisfying the individual needs and wishes of\nthose who use, or \u2018consume\u2019 such services. Governments have\nresponded to this demand by adapting, to varying degrees, many\nstate run public services, in attempts to offer greater responsive-\nness and greater choice.\nUK governments since 1979 have enacted a series of reforms to\npublic services in this direction. For example, The Thatcher\ngovernment in the UK (1979e1990) introduced market forces into\nhealth and social care via the formation of the internal market in\nthe NHS and a similar separation of purchasers and providers in\nsocial care with the introduction of the Griffiths reforms and the\n1990 NHS and Community Care Act.2 The New Labour government\n(1997e2010) continued the direction of travel with further reforms\nto public services aimed at increasing diversity, influence and\nchoice for users of public services.3 The coalition government\nelected in 2010was quick to produce plans for change in the NHS, in\nthe white paper \u2018Equity and Excellence\u2019. This document makes it\nvery clear that the theme of patient choice will be even more\ncentral to health policy \u201cThe NHS also scores relatively poorly on\nbeing responsive to the patients it serves. It lacks a genuinely patient-\ncentred approach in which services are designed around individualAll rights reserved.\n, Personal health budgets: A\n1016\/j.ctcp.2010.12.002needs, lifestyles and aspirations\u201d, \u201c We will put patients at the heart of\nthe NHS, through an information revolution and greater choice and\ncontrol\u201d, \u201cShared decision-making will become the norm: no decision\nabout me without me\u201d.4\n2. Direct payments, personal budgets and health care\nOne method of giving users significant choice and control is via\nthe mechanism of a personal budget. This enables a person to be\noffered, in lieu of directly provided services, an equivalent sum of\nmoney, for them to purchase their own care and services. In the field\nof social care campaigning by various groups led to the setting up\na set of 13 pilot projects for personal budgets in social care across\nlocal authorities in England from the end of 2005. Unusually, eval-\nuation of these projects using an RCT was part of the pilot project\nprocess. Illustrating the dictum that it is often the case that policy\ndrives evidence rather than the reverse, the care services minister at\nthe time, announced that personal budgets were the future of social\ncare, well before the evaluation was complete. Nevertheless the\nevaluation report did indicate that personal budgets provided\nincreased choice and control and positive outcomes in terms of\nhealth and well being for most service user groups.5 The policy has\nbeen rolledout nationallyand local authorities nowhave challenging\ntargets in relation to the number of service users who are using this\nmechanism of support. At the end of 2009, over 25,000 social care\nservice users in England andWales were receiving personal budgets\nand the aim is that 30% of those who receive community based\nservices will receive a personal budget by April 2011.6\nOne of the issues which arose from the social care pilot projects,\nwas that of the dividing line between health and social care.new way of accessing complementary therapies? Complementary\nJ. Rogers \/ Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice xxx (2010) 1e52Because the two are funded differently this becomes an important\nissue for both service users and those setting up and providing\nservices. To meet a persons assessed needs, a range of services and\ninterventions may be offered, and there is often no obvious point at\nwhich a health need becomes a social care need.\nIn fact researchers found that many people receiving direct\npayments for social care used them to purchase a range of services\ntraditionally defined as health care.\nThese included physiotherapy, foot dressings and so on but also\nCAM therapies for pain relief and relaxation.5\nMoreover, the evaluation of the programme found that more\nthan half of personal budget holders reported better health and 57%\nof family care givers reported better health,7 even though the\nbudgets were specifically set up to fund social care only and at the\ntime the department of health were adamant that personal budgets\nwould never be introduced for health care because they flouted the\nfundamental principles of the NHS.\nAround this time Glasby et al. noted that what was remarkable\nabout direct payments\/personal budgets was \u201cthe extent to which\nthey mirror key policy goals in the UK NHS yet have historically been\nresisted in health care\u201d.8 Also at this time developments in relation to\nhealth care such as theDarzi reviewwere calling for increased choice\nand the use of personalisationwithin the NHS to achieve this kind of\nchoice. One of the key stated aims of the reforms recommended by\nthis reviewwas to empower patients. \u201cThe NHS needs to give patients\nmore rights and control over their own health and care, for more\npersonal care\u201d.9 A number of documents from think tanks such as the\nDemos Foundation10 and The Social Market Foundation11 together\nwith reports from Canada, the USA, the Netherlands and Australia\nwhich all had experience of personal budgets in health care,8 sup-\nported their use as a very effective mechanism for giving patients\nchoice, control and better outcomes in relation to health care.\nThe result of these various drivers was the setting up in the UK,\nin 2009, of 75 pilot projects of personal health budgets (PHBs). It is\nnotable that half of all primary care trusts (PCTs) in the country\napplied to become pilot sites. The aim was initially to offer these\nbudgets to people in four particular groups: those receiving NHS\ncontinuing health care; those with long term conditions; those\nwith mental health problems; and those receiving end of life care.12\nThese pilot projects are running for a period of three years and\na subset of 20 are being evaluated by the Personal Social Services\nResearch Unit at the University of Kent. The health white paper\nproduced by the coalition government describes a continuing\ncommitment to this programme.\nWhen the pilots commenced there was not a legal mechanism\nfor offering direct cash payments to individual health service users.\nWhilst social care users have legally been able to receive direct\nfinance in the shape of direct payments since the 1996 direct\npayments act, the personal health budget pilots were set up with\nnotional budgets, or in some cases budgets held in some kind of\ntrust set up on behalf of the patient by a third party.12 The Health\nAct 2009, which received Royal Assent in November 2009, changed\nthe law in this regard and direct payments were available to PHB\nholders from Summer 2010.\n3. Complementary medicine, chronic illness and personal\nbudgets\nThis is clearly an interesting development from the point of view\nof complementarymedicine for several reasons. Firstly, the fact that\nthe kind of NHS users who are being offered PHBs are typically the\nkind of people who use complementary therapies, i.e. those with\nchronic, long term conditions who tend to consume a lot of NHS\nresources and who do not experience significant benefit from these\nNHS interventions.13,14Please cite this article in press as: Rogers J, Personal health budgets: A\nTherapies in Clinical Practice (2010), doi:10.1016\/j.ctcp.2010.12.002Secondly the fact that there is good evidence that many of those\nwho would most like to access complementary therapies are pre-\nvented from doing so for reasons of cost and access15e17 and that\nPHBs may provide a new mechanism of access for many people.\nThirdly, that this development brings into sharp focus the possible\nconflict between drives on the one hand to increase the amount of\nchoice and control that service users can have, and on the other the\ndrive for publicly funded interventions to be evidence based\naccording to very specific types of evidence.\nIn relation to CAM use and chronic illness, a number of surveys\nhave been undertaken in the UK and elsewhere of those who use\ncomplementary medicine, which have given some insight into the\nnumbers and some of the characteristics of such users. A systematic\nreview of studies found that the most reliable estimates suggested\nconsistent consultation rates with CAM practitioners of 20% or\nmore of the population in a variety of countries including South\nAustralia, the US and the UK.18 People with chronic illness use CAM\nmodalities 2e5 times more than others.19 One Dutch study found\nthat 33% of the chronically ill population use CAM.20 Looking at it\nfrom a different perspective a study examining the health status of\npeople using CAM practitioner services in four English counties\nfound that 60% of CAM users reported having a chronic illness or\ndisability, significantly higher that the general population.21 It is\nestimated that 80% (or up to 180 million) GP visits in the UK are\nrelated to chronic illness.22With an ageing population this will only\nincrease in the coming years.23 A recent review of a large number of\nstudies confirmed a strong association between chronic illness,\nparticularly with multiple conditions; and CAM use.24\nMany professionals within the NHS recognise the limitations of\nexisting evidence based interventions for many chronic conditions\nandweknow that somewill prescribe CAM therapies forwhere such\nan \u2018effectiveness gap\u2019 has been described.25 Indeed it was estimated\nthat 39.5% of GP practices provided access to some form of CAM in\n199515 and that this had risen to 50%by2001.26 One detailed studyof\nthose with long term conditions who use CAM concluded that such\nuse should be understood as a critical component of self care\nmanagement in general and should be viewed not as a search for\na miracle cure or a rejection of conventional medicine but as an\nattempt to take personal responsibility for health and a pragmatic\nattempt at managing a chronic condition as well as possible.14 From\nthis perspective CAM use should be welcomed and encouraged as\na good example of the kind of self management and assumption of\nresponsibility for health which Department of Health Policy is\nadvocating.27 Indeed the kind of active role which is adopted by\nthose who seek out and inform themselves about CAM therapies for\ntheir chronic ailments is exactly the kind of approach which the\nDepartment of Health expert patient programme recommends.28\nIn terms of the evidence relating to access and demographic\nfactors, surveys consistently suggest that those who use CAM are\nbetter educated. The latest review of research suggests that this\nfactor is consistently associated with CAM use. The relationship\nbetween income and CAM use is less consistent though a large\nnumber of studies show an association between higher income and\nCAM use than not.24\nIt has been noted that CAM use is higher among those with\nchronic illness and that many such users express great satisfaction\nwith such interventions. It is likely to be the case that those with\nchronic illness are much more likely to live on state benefits or be\non lower incomes. Indeed there is a lot of evidence that chronic\nillness is socially patterned and that there is a gradient with those\non lowest incomes experiencing the highest levels of ill health.29,30\nWhilst many GP practices provide some form of access or referral to\nCAM, as noted earlier, it is also the case that increasingly, such\naccess is less likely to be funded by the NHS.26 Following campaigns\nby small groups of professionals some routes of access have beennew way of accessing complementary therapies? Complementary\nJ. Rogers \/ Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice xxx (2010) 1e5 3cut back in recent years. Referrals to the NHS homeopathic hospi-\ntals for example, have been reduced by many PCTs.31 Those on\nlower incomes are currently far less likely to be able to use CAM\nsince the economics and the time consuming nature of most CAM\ninterventions make them relatively expensive at the point of\ndelivery, without any public subsidy.\nCritics of personal health budgets have suggested that they may\nlead to greater health inequalities as the more articulate and well\neducated know how to work the system.32 Evidence suggests\nhowever that without public subsidy and public access mecha-\nnisms, individuals with chronic health problems, whowould like to\nutilise CAM, are less likely to have the means or the knowledge to\naccess them. In this sense PHBs may actually lead to far greater\nequity when it comes to access to CAM treatments.\n4. The evidence debate\nThe drive towards evidence based health care has been very\nstrong and growing since the 1980s.33 In using this term, many\ncommentators implicitly or explicitly refer to specific types of\nevidence, and typically refer to the scientific hierarchy in which\nRCTs and systematic reviews and meta-analysis enjoy pride of\nplace.\nMany complementary therapies are not supported by a strong\nevidence base in these terms.34 However, the same therapies often\nenjoy significant popular usage and many service users believe\nstrongly that such therapies are beneficial. If public policy is to\ndriven by issues of choice and user control, should evidence be\na secondary consideration? Many scientists and professionals think\nthat sufficient levels of certain types of scientific evidence should\nbe the primary consideration in directing public resources to health\ncare interventions.35 Others suggest that the primary questions\nshould be different ones and that the most appropriate evidence\nrelates to whether an intervention is safe, meets a person\u2019s iden-\ntified need and whether they are satisfied with the outcome in the\nreal world, rather than whether that intervention has been shown\nto be statistically different in the restricted population and envi-\nronment of a randomised trial.36\nUnsurprisingly service users and health professionals who\nsupport CAM are broadly in favour of the development of PHBs:\nother health professionals who are committed to the EBM agenda\nhave portrayed it as misguided. The NHS Alliance have come out in\nfavour and noted that \u201c patients will be allowed to go outside of\nNHS guidelines\u201d. However, a negotiator for GPs stated that \u201cI think\nthere seems to be some confusion in Government policy. On the one\nhand they have been quite clear that the NHS should use resources\nbased on evidence-based guidance developed by NICE, but there seems\nto be some confusion about the degree of flexibility patients will have.\nFor example most complementary therapies are not supported by NICE\nguidance\u201d.37\nSuch comments go to the heart of debates about the meaning of\nevidence based medicine. The established hierarchy of evidence\nplaces a big emphasis on the very specific and well delineated\ninterventions, which have been able to demonstrate efficacy within\nthe tightly controlled conditions of a clinical trial.\nBut there is also good evidence that factors other than the specific\nefficacy of a tightly defined intervention can have significant benefits\nto health. There is a strong body of evidence, for example, that\ndemonstrates that giving patients choice and control leads to better\nhealth outcomes and even greater longevity. In one study people\nliving in care homeswhowere simplygiven a plant to look after lived\nsignificantly longer.38 A study of women undergoing surgery for\nbreast cancer noted that those women given a choice of treatment,\nwith the agreement of the surgeon, had less post operative depres-\nsion than those whose surgeon insisted on either mastectomy orPlease cite this article in press as: Rogers J, Personal health budgets: A\nTherapies in Clinical Practice (2010), doi:10.1016\/j.ctcp.2010.12.002lumpectomy.39 In a large RCT, the effect of giving a choice of formats\nfor a programme of heart disease management improved physical\nand psychosocial functioning.40\nIn this sense, a commitment to evidence based interventions\ncould lead to a view that the choice and control provided by PHB\u2019s\nmean that they are strongly evidence based and a completely\nrational direction for health policy, rather than misguided. Regard-\nless of the specific interventions chosen by an individual, and as long\nas they are not harmful, the fact of having the power to choose, may\nbe significantly beneficial for a patient with a long term problem\nwhich has not responded to conventional health interventions.\nThis becomes an issue of which type of knowledge becomes\nprivileged. Will it be knowledge from the accepted hierarchy of\nevidence? Will it be consumer led? Or will it be based on profes-\nsional power and judgement?\n5. Personal health budgets in practice\nSo far an argument has been made for providing access to CAM\ntherapies via the emerging mechanism of personal health budgets.\nIs this likely to happen to any significant extent in practice? What\nbarriers or objections might be raised to such a move?\nExperience in social care demonstrated significant professional\nresistance to the introduction of both direct payments and personal\nbudgets.8 Researchers also found that, once the concept was\noperationalised, the benefits to service users become apparent, and\nprofessionals become excited about new ways of working in part-\nnership rather than worried about losing their job or their role, the\nresistance from professionals was significantly reduced.41\nThere is no single model which describes exactly how personal\nbudgets will work in practice or how people might access\ncomplementary therapies using such budgets. The essential prin-\nciple relates to putting the patient in control and ensuring that they\nhave the choice and resources to access services which meet their\nassessed needs. There are certain activities and services which are\nproscribed, such as the purchase of alcohol or tobacco, gambling,\nrepayment of personal debt, and the payment of college or\neducational fees. Other than that the Department of Health guid-\nance states only that the patient must use their budget to \u2018procure\nservices specified in their care plan\u2019.12\nSome authors think that GPs should gate keep and recommend\nthe treatment provider to be used, after diagnosis has been made.8\nThe patient would then spend their allocated budget with that\nprovider. Another model suggests that patients should be able to\nchoose from a menu of approved treatment providers without\ndirect recommendations from a GP or other professional and the\nmore radical model suggests a wider set of choices be made\navailable to patients.8\nGlasby et al. have suggested that, for those with long term\nconditions, a full assessment of predictable long term care needs\nwould be followed by the costing of resource implications for\na period of perhaps one year, to determine a budget. The patient\nwould then be given a cash sum in the same way as social care\ndirect payments. The patient may seek assistance from health\nprofessional or user support organisations to manage the process,\nbut theywould be free to choose their own care so long as it broadly\nmet their identified needs.8\nWith regard to CAM provision it was noted above that there\nwere examples from the social care evaluation programme of\npeople using their social care personal budget to fund CAM treat-\nments. There are already a number of examples from the personal\nhealth budget pilots of similar decisions being made, and of them\nmaking a real difference in peoples lives. To take just one example,\nresearch in Norfolk in 2009 found that those with long term\nconditions who used complementary treatments regularly \u201coftennew way of accessing complementary therapies? Complementary\nJ. Rogers \/ Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice xxx (2010) 1e54described them as being more effective and valuable to the manage-\nment of their condition than the prescription drugs they use\u201d.426. Risk issues\nA number of objections have been raised to the shifting of both\nresources and responsibility from professionals employed by the\nstate to individual users of welfare services. One such objection in\nrelation to both health and social care relates to quality and stan-\ndards. Professionals employed by local authorities and the NHS are\ntrained to certain standards and are subject to significant regula-\ntion and monitoring.\nIn social care there has been significant debate in relation to the\nemployment by service users of untrained personal assistants,\nthe terms and conditions of employment of such assistants and the\nright of users to choose not to insist on regulatory checks such as\nCRB clearance, and minimum levels of training.43 In health there\nare concerns in relation to individuals choosing to purchase\nservices from untrained and potentially dangerous practitioners of\nnon conventional therapies. Critics of CAM often point to a number\nof related risks. The most commonly articulated is that people may\nuse CAM as a complete alternative and visit practitioners who fail to\ndiagnose serious health problems, with resulting morbidity or\nmortality.44 These critics acknowledge that there is little systematic\nresearch into this area and therefore any such evidence is\nanecdotal.\nWith personal health budgets it will always be the case that\nthere is some gate keeping or oversight by GPs or other health\nprofessionals, and negotiation with those professionals regarding\nthe actual use of the budget. In addition the department of health\nguidance for pilot projects is pointing people towards practitioners\nwho are registered with the recently established Complementary\nand Natural Health care Council (CNHC), as a means of ensuring\nsafety and minimum standards.45 Giving choice and responsibility\nto individuals and letting go of a little professional power and\ncontrol inevitably entails some amount of risk. What should be\nconsidered is whether the significant gains which may result more\nthan outweigh the small amount of risk.\n7. Conclusion\nIn recent years the increasing popularity of CAM interventions\nhas been countered with a backlash from a movement which\ncharacterises CAM as lacking in credible evidence and which\nargues as a consequence that public monies should not be given to\nany interventions of this kind. This paper has argued for a different\nperspective on evidence. With very clear evidence that choice and\ncontrol are beneficial to health, the moves towards greater choice\nin health care and more personalised care should be welcomed.\nThe mechanism of personal budgets is demonstrably good for\nhealth, and whether an individual chooses to use their budget to\npurchase CAM treatments or not should be a matter for negotia-\ntion with their health care professionals but ultimately a matter of\npersonal choice. It is certainly clear that the types of individuals\nwho are receiving personal health budgets receive limited benefits\nfrom traditional NHS care, and clear that such care is expensive.\nSuch individuals would often choose CAM treatments but have\noften been denied access to them. The provision of CAM via\npersonal health budgets to those with long term conditions,\nchronic illness, mental illness, and those receiving end of life care,\ncan potentially offer many gains, and there is little to lose by\nallowing such access. If the loud rhetoric of patient choice is to\nmean anything then this is certainly a direction in which the NHS\nshould continue to move.Please cite this article in press as: Rogers J, Personal health budgets: A\nTherapies in Clinical Practice (2010), doi:10.1016\/j.ctcp.2010.12.002Conflict of interest statement\nThe author declares that he has no conflict of interest.References\n1.
