For rather\nthan dwelling on existing psycho-analytic models\nof the relation between symbol formation (ie\nsubstitution) and creativity which are based on\nlack, absence, and separation or complete assimi-\nlation, the emphasis instead is on acceptance of\nthe individual nature of the Other, and '...an ethics\nof exchange, acceptance and connection.' This\nmodel suggests a prenatal relation of reciprocal\ncontact, 'the most intimate and the most unknown\nmeeting in a profound alliance of difference' in\nthe borderline zone of the psycho-corporeal.\nRather than 'reading' motifs as a symbols, or the\ncarpets and cloths simply as artefacts or objects,\nthey become 'events in weaving', narratives of\n(inter)subjectivity and creativity: 'at the\nborderline\/ of consciousness, codifying a pre-\nlinguistic knowledge and ethics drawn from\nfemale experience.\nAgain, in metaphorical terms, weaving is seen\nas analogous to the 'ceaseless interweaving of\nrelationships', one thread crossing another, a\nconstant exchange between Self and Other.\n1 See Bracha Lichtenberg-Ettinger, Artworkings 1985-\n1999, Palais Des Beaux-Arts, Brussels & Ludion Ghent,\nAmsterdam.\n2 quotation taken from the press pack.\n3 Paul Vandenbroeck, AZETTA, L'art des femmes berbers,\nLudion Gand, Amsterdam\/Flammarion & Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de\nExposition, Palais Des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, 2000.\n4 Jennifer Robinson, 'White Women\nResearching\/Representing 'Others: From Anti-\nApartheid to Postcolonialism', in Writing Women and\nSpace: Colonial and Post Colonial Geographies, eds Alison\nBlunt and Gillian Rose, Guildford Press.

Although this has\nbecome a sought after accolade in the arts when\nassociated with shock tactics, provocation and\nirreverence; it is not a desirable stigma when\nanswering to charges of narcissism, ignorance or\nworse.\nEveryone has asked, what is this exhibition\nabout? Including the show's curators, Matthew\nHiggs and Paul Noble (albeit rhetorically). Sarah\nKent wisely suggests that 'perhaps they should\nhave answered the question before selecting the\nshow'. Protest and Survive, the title of the\nexhibition, was once a CND (Campaign for\nNuclear Disarmament) call to arms. Appropriated\nfor the purpose of this show, it nostalgically aims\nto represent political art from the sixties and in\ndoing so, it falls hostage to all the criticisms made\nagainst it by the arts establishment. The show's\nextravagant claims that the list of forty works\nincluded 'deal, variously, with gender, race, class,\nidentity, sexuality, idealism, passion, resistance,\nboredom, frustration and pleasure' do not help.\nThe large amount of work on show inevitably\ndraws attention to issues of inclusion\/exclusion.\nViewing is dull and no sense of coherence or\nrigour emerges in terms of how the work is\npositioned in relation to each other. As each work\nstands alone, out of context, it becomes\nfragmented and lacking in meaning. The show is\nun-energising, without vigour, something which\nis not usually associated with political art. A\nlasting impression is a shopping list of who's\nwho. At best it is reminiscent of early\/mid\neighties first year Cultural Studies programmes in\nBritish Art Colleges (Jo Spence, Gilbert & George,\nRichard Hamilton, Paul Graham, Cosey Fanni\nTutti etc). At worse this show can be gimmicky\nand twee (Rob Pruitt's Evian fountain or\nWolfgang Tillmans' photographic collaboration\nwith The Big Issue). But in all cases the show\ntends to invite charges of exclusion. In fact,\nProtest and Survive seems to be more about the\npolitics of exclusion than anything else. Sarah\nKent disdainfully offers two eloquent lists of\nleading female and male artists who are conspic-\nuously absent: 'Carolee Schneeman, Catherine\nElwes, Alexis Hunter, Margaret Harrison, Rose\nGarrard, Susan Hiller, Martha Rosier, Barbara\nKruger, Judy Chicago, Karen Finlay, Orlans,\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nUn\niv\ner\nsi\nty\n f\nor\n t\nhe\n C\nre\nat\niv\ne \nAr\nts\n T\nhe\n L\nib\nra\nry\n] \nAt\n: \n09\n:1\n7 \n23\n J\nul\ny \n20\n09\n101\nspeaks about the curators. Thompson's text reads\n'one day son, all this will be art galleries', the\ncartoon is of a man and a boy looking over an\nindustrial city. Is this the art world offering these\ncurators their inheritance?\nSimilarly Bank's Lowry-like painting of\nmatchstick men is self-referential, with the\ncaption 'Would you be worried if one of these\nNortherners ceased to exist? In the process of\nmapping their identity, Higgs and Noble seem to\nhave conveniently forgotten, like many others of\ntheir age, race and gender, that politics in Britain\nhas extended beyond the nostalgia of a worthy\nMike Leigh script on the so-called working-classes\nup North in the seventies.\nProtest and Survive is not an exhibition of\npolitical art since the sixties. This is a show, which\nCatalogue cover: CND March, Chorley, Lancashire,\n,atc Seventies, image courtesy Chorley Guardian\nmaps the work that informed Matthew Higgs and\nTim Noble in shaping their artistic\/political\npsycho-geography. Their curator mate was right.\nThis is a show about work they like because it\nspeaks of their own history and their culture. It is\na show, which defines them. Seen in this context\nthe work curated makes sense, the random and\nseemingly unrigorous selection begins to take\nshape. It is vision of political art from a specific\npoint of view. We have seen it all before.\nWhat makes this show so problematic and\noffensive is not just that the mapping of political\nart has once again been assigned to the usual\nsuspects but that this subject positioning is\ndisavowed. Instead, Protest and Survive colonises\nthe notion of political art, erases its key discourses\non gender and race and then re-proposes political\nart, by silencing and assimilating the voices of the\n'other'. What is strange however is that this does\nnot seem to be a deliberate or strategic effort to\nsabotage 'other' political agendas. If this were the\ncase Higgs and Noble would not have gone to\nconsiderable efforts to include the homoerotic\nwork of Tom of Finland. This work has never\nbefore been shown in a public gallery in Britain\nand apparently caused some controversy with\nregard to the sponsor's (the financial company\nBloomberg's) approval.\nDespite the curator's ignorance of postcolonial\nart or confusion over gender\/sexual politics, it is\ndifficult to understand how anybody can stage a\nshow of political art at the Whitechapel and\nignore that the gallery is located in one of the most\nradical sites of political racial contestation in\nLondon?\nInstead Thomas Hirschhorn, whose bridge\nlinks the Whitechapel's caf\u00e9 with the anarchist\nFreedom bookshop, offers the only acknowl-\nedgement to the local area outside the gallery and\nclearly this has nothing to do with issues of race or\nthe local Bengali community. Yet Higgs seems to\nbe particularly proud of this piece. He confirms\nhis desperate desire to be thought of as an\nanarchist as he states that Hirschhorn's work is 'a\ngentle reminder of anarchy's core values'. You get\nthe feeling that he missed out on being a punk in\nthe late seventies (punks didn't go on CND\nmarches) and is now making up for this\nhumiliating oversight, by trying to hold on to\nsome dated concept of anarchy.\nBut the real issue here is why were Matthew\nHiggs and Paul Noble invited to curate such a\nshow at the Whitechapel in the first place? Has the\nrole of curator as author been given such celebrity\nstatus, that even galleries like the Whitechapel\nand curators like Judith Nesbitt, are under\npressure to court the likes of celebrity curators\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nUn\niv\ner\nsi\nty\n f\nor\n t\nhe\n C\nre\nat\niv\ne \nAr\nts\n T\nhe\n L\nib\nra\nry\n] \nAt\n: \n09\n:1\n7 \n23\n J\nul\ny \n20\n09\n102\n1\nPaul Graham, Baby, DHSS office, Birmingham 1984,1985, vintage ectacolour print, 76 x 101cm,\ncourtesy Anthony Reynolds Gallery\nLinda Benglis, Mary Kelly, Margaret Harrison,\nYoko Ono, Gina Pane, Cynthia Plastercaster, and\nthe Gorilla Girls' and 'Stuart Brisley, Conrad\nAtkinson, Hans Haacke, Chris Burden, Douglas\nHuebler, Vito Acconci, Peter Kennard, Victor\nB\u00fcrgin and Rasheed Araeen'. Let alone the huge\nimpact that black experimental filmmaking has\nhad in Britain in the 1980's! What about the Black\nAudio Film Collective and Sankofa and all the\nother black artists\/filmmakers who been\nexcluded? The list is endless. But maybe this is not\nthe right approach to understanding the show.\nIn defence of Protest and Survive, an East End\ngallery curator and a friend of Higgs' claimed that\nthey only included work they like. So the reason\nthat they have not sufficiently included work\nwhich deals with gender issues (apart from a\ntoken gesture towards Jo Spence, Valie Export,\nCosey Fanni Tutti and the Hackney Flashers;) or\nwork that has taken issues of race as its subject, is\ndue to the fact that they do not like it. So maybe\nwe should question what is it that they do like?\nIf anybody is in any doubt, look at the\nexhibition catalogue, it reveals all. What it seems\nthey like rather a lot, given its prominent\npositioning, is the solipsistic image on the cover of\nthe catalogue. This is a blown up photograph of\nMatthew Higgs, in Chorley, Lancashire, in the late\nseventies, on a CND March. Matthew Higgs, as a\nworking class, 'shy, Northern boy', as he likes to\ndefine himself. So if you are in any doubt, it is\nquite clear, the show is about the curators and\nmore specifically about Matthew Higgs.\nIf you're still unsure the Observer critic, Laura\nCumming, offers further insight to this exhibition.\nLike Kent, Cummings dedicated her review of the\nexhibition to the notion of exclusion, in this case\nthat of the cartoonist Steve Bell. She cannot\nexplain why a cartoon by Robert Thompson has\nbeen included and not any by Bell. The reason is\nsimple. The show is not about the artists included.\nIt is about the work and specifically work which\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nUn\niv\ner\nsi\nty\n f\nor\n t\nhe\n C\nre\nat\niv\ne \nAr\nts\n T\nhe\n L\nib\nra\nry\n] \nAt\n: \n09\n:1\n7 \n23\n J\nul\ny \n20\n09\n103\nlike Matthew Higgs for the sake of\npublicity, no matter what they show? Given the\nlocal community's accusations that there has been\nlittle acknowledgement of its Bengali residents,\nthis is surely another embarrassment for the\ngallery's compromised track record on race\nrelations. Two years ago the gallery settled out of\ncourt after a job applicant accused the\nWhitechapel of race discrimination. Not much\nseems to have improved since, as the only\nblack\/Asian employees (except for a member of\nthe 'ethnic minorities' in education - whatever\nthat means) from the local community continue to\nbe the cleaners. More significantly, the only show\nto exhibit Asian arts in the last couple of years,\nwas hastily put together, lasted only three weeks\nand was curated by a couple of students. Surely\nthis exhibition was a great opportunity to re-\naddress such problems.\nBut at least this time the local community got\na look-in at the lavish mostly-white (apart from\nthe waiters), opening party which was rumoured\nto have cost in the region of \u00a327,000, as local kids\nwere allowed in for a Dickensian portion of\nstrawberries and ice-cream.\nProtest and Survive was at the Whitechapel,\n15 September - 12 November 2000.\nDak'Art 2000\nThe Millennium Biennale?\nBisi Silva\nThe 5th of May 2000 witnessed the opening in\nAfrica of the first biennnal of the new millennium.\nWith the demise of the short-lived Johannesburg\nBiennale expectations were high and the onus on\nDak'Art 2000 to deliver was all the more acute. If\nthe opening was anything to go by, the\nimportance attached to the event resulted in no\nless than the presence of the newly elected\nPresident, Abdoulaye Wade, and other political\nheavyweights such as the Minister of Culture and\nLeader of the Senate gracing the ceremony.\nFollowing the warm reception for the Biennale's\nGeneral Secretary, Remi Sagna, the president's\nspeech seemed to be the climax of the event. Apart\nfrom the inevitable political diatribe, Wade's\nspeech was peppered with choice promises that\nincluded the building of an art academy and a\ngallery of international standing. This obviously\nreceived a standing ovation. Only time will tell.\nDak'Art 2000 was divided into three sections:\nA group exhibition, a design and textile exhibition\nand individual artists' exhibition. The main\nexhibition at IFAN presented the work of 21\nartists from ten countries. An international jury\nled by David Elliot, director of the Moderna\nMuseet, Stockholm, made this selection from over\n200 entries. South Africa was not only well\nrepresented through the works of Andries Botha\nand Tracey Rose, but it is Bernadette Searle's\nimposing digital photographic installation that\nwon the Revelation (Newcomer) Prize.
