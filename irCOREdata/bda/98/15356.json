This has been argued and the arguments \nfor racial taxonomies imploded time and again through the work of scholars such as Hall \n(1990; 1996; 1997), Robert J.C.Young (2008) and many others. However there appear two \ngaps in where this work has led us. \n \nFirst, racial categorisation is felt and enacted through a profoundly emotive register. Yet \nsocial constructivist demythologising claims to speak in the language of analytic, rationalist \ncritique. While it is familiar enough to say that race (and nation) demonstrate there is \nnothing \u2018mere\u2019 about social constructs, it also begs the question why the defence is so often \nneeded. What we seem to lack is a way to engage with the tempestuous forces of inter-\nracial encounters. It is a conceit that our societies are founded upon rational orders, and a \nconceit of social science that rational orders might describe these processes. Our turn to the \naffective register then is to address those emotive forces that otherwise escape, evade and \nexceed, or are belittled by, academic accountings. In doing this we echo moves in geography \nthat have seen the rise of studies of the emotional and affective. What emerges in the \ndifference between \u2018emotional\u2019 and \u2018affective\u2019 is the sense that the affective represents the \nways in which flows of emotion coalesce to form a social phenomenon that is beyond the \nindividual subjective responses, feelings and sensibilities. Affect also moves us on to a \nterrain where race as felt identity is immanent to interactions \u2013 and in that sense, it \nmaterialises the felt world. In Thrift\u2019s account (2004) the affective economy drives our \ngeopolitical arena, our urban landscapes and is central to everyday life, beyond the \nindividual. This transpersonal dimension seems vital for our understanding of the social \nforces of race. Examining affect as the capacity to affect another, to ask not what a body is \nbut what it does offers a chance to found accounts of race in the relational construction of \nidentities, in the forces created between people rather then in fixed social categories.  \n \nSecond, in the 21st century there is a re-emergence of a fashion for materialising difference \nthrough the physical codes of the body; DNA, cells and inherited physicality are accounted \nfor in race difference within medical science, and new philosophies of the body (Nash 2008).  \nThe developing of genotyping and racially targeted drugs speak both to renewed \nunderstandings of biology and descent but also themselves encode the social assumptions \nof scientists as to the existence and boundaries of races (Fullwiley 2007, page 16). In the last \nfew years the possibilities for tracing continuities of first constant Y chromosomes, that is \nmale descent, (as popularised in the TV series \u2018Meet the Ancestors\u2019), and then \nmitochondrial DNA have expanded; so much so that there are now claims for a study of \n\u2018genetic geography\u2019  that can identify current European nationals from their DNA \n(Novembre et al. 2008). Using similar techniques, arguments over the (existence, extent and \norigins of) Celtic peoples, the origin and succession of inhabits of the British Isles in \nprehistoric times have been rekindled - with books such as Stephen Oppenheimer\u2019s \u2018The \nOrigins of the British: A Genetic Detective Story\u2019 arguing for an original settlement from \nNorthern Spain (for a summary see his precis in Prospect magazine 2006). All of which \nseems to raise the spectre of debates we might have thought long gone on the biological \nexistence of races, although now they are (sometimes) deliberately seeking to destabilize \n(some) essentialised national identities. Meanwhile some strands of anti-racist thought have \nalso been reliant on materialist scientific, physicality (of shared genomic composition) to \nchallenge the \u2018myth of race\u2019. \n \nThis moment of challenge to the hold of social constructivist approaches however produces \nnumerous pitfalls and paradoxes regarding how we might move forwards. These we wish to \naddress these first through a brief reprise of the history of racial phenotyping then to sketch \nout some dangers that illustrates for affective accounts, before asking how the papers \ngathered here address those.   \n \nThe Dangerous Embodiments of Race \nThere is a long history of attempts to secure racial identities upon taxonomies of the human \nspecies grounded in biological characteristics \u2013 of physical science as ground for racial \nmyths. Some cases of this are relatively well known to the point of being stock lectures on \nthe curriculum, such as the debate between the polygenists and monogenisists over \nwhether races were separate species (Gould 1994)) and how the very doing of \u2018racial \nscience is a history of accommodations of the sciences to the deeply held convictions about \nthe \u2018naturalness\u2019 of the inequalities between human races\u2019 (Gould 1977 page 144). \nSubsequent scholarship has shown that many of the carefully compiled, tabulated and \ncategorized figures on cranial capacity, developed on the skulls of so many scientific \nartefacts collected from the colonies were erroneous and misused to produced hierarchical \nresults (Gould 1994).  \n \nIt would be too easy to simply then mark these down as defunct issues long since exposed \nas science being corrupted in the service of racial ideology. But the biological approaches to \nrace have also been associated not simply with black versus white, but fine grained \nidentifications of European peoples \u2013 whom colloquially might all now find themselves \nticking the same box on an equal opportunities monitoring form, who might now be subject \nto analysis by \u2018genetic geography\u2019. For instance, within Europe Beddoe (1971 [1885]) \ndevised an index of Negresence that served to grade capacities of savagery and intellect.  \nThis index was founded upon more than skin pigment, and included a range of phenotypical \ncharacterisations perhaps not know so often associated with race. Thus skull shape encoded \nin the cephallic index (comparing length and breadth ratios) becomes the very index of \ncivilisation; not merely its representation but its corporeal expression.  This approach might \nlead to now surprising claims regarding a Celtic type: \n\u201cWhile Ireland is apparently its present centre most of its lineaments are such as \nlead us to think of Africa as its possible birthplace; and it may be well provisionally, \nto call it Africanoid\u201d (Beddoes, 1971*1885+, page 11) \nThe racialised bigotry as well as their colonized status, aligns the Irish with Africa then. Our \npurpose is not to review all the possible examples but to point to a long heritage of \ndisciplinary regimes of knowledge based on these biological classifications emerged in the \n18th and 19th centuries (Anderson, 2007; Young, 2007). The figure of the black savage \naccording to these social scientific evidences is about temperament and emotion as much as \nphysiognomy. Thus Carl Linnaeus from the first Swedish edition of Systema naturae in 1735 \nto the one in 1758, had split the newly minted species of homo sapiens into four types \ncontrast Homo Europaeus to Homo Afer according to capacity for emotional governance \n(Pred 2004, page 9). In this as so many accounts the black savage lives his\/her life in the \nrealm of purely emotional, sensual and significantly, non-intellectual engagement; \u2018The \nantithesis of European sexual mores and beauty is embodied in the black, and the essential \nblack, the lowest rung on the great chain of being, is the Hottentot\u2019 (Gilman 1985, page 212; \nsee also Bhattacharyya, 1998; for an account of the tragic replacement of the \u2018Hottentot\u2019 in \nthe lowest category with the Australian Aboriginal as a \u2018pre-Adamite\u2019 sub-human in the mid \nnineteenth century, see Anderson, 2007). Similarly, and with equally avid and revealing zeal \nscience set out to classify the sexual physiology of races, with phalloplethymetry measuring \npenis length and the anatomical studies published by Georges Cuvier on the physiognomy of \nthe \u2018Hottentot\u2019, which focused upon her skin color and the form of her genitalia to label her \nas inherently different symbolizing not only a \"primitive\" sexual appetite but also the \nexternal signs of this temperament via \"primitive\" genitalia (Gilman op.cit. page 213; \nSolomon-Godeau 1996). Thus, the civilised are set apart from the savage, and bodies \n(dispassionately promoted as) material cultures are \u2018scientifically classified\u2019 as evidenced in \nhistory \u2013 with Sarah Baartmen, the original \u2018Hottentot venus\u2019, having her brain and genitalia \npreserved in formaldehyde and exhibited in the Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019homme till 1974, and only being \nrepatriated for burial in 2002. These modes of disciplinary inquiry one might say sublimated \naffectual economies of fears and desires to produce cultural categories of race \ndifferentiated between biology (phenotypes), each of these had associated cultural \npotential for a spectrum of sensibilities. And in those hierarchies of sensibilities, fears and \ndesires we see risks for the emergence of affective accounts. \n \nPhilosophies and Histories of the emotional animal that is \u2018man\u2019 \nA turn towards theories of emotion and affect has been gathering pace since the late 1990s. \nThese theoretical, empirical and practical interventions are inevitably informed by \nphilosophies and philosophers of what it is to be human, to be sentient and to be capable of \naffective power and emotion. And the entwining there of race and affect, is exemplified in \nthe limits of the celebrated cosmopolitanism of Kant: \n\u2018The Negroes of Africa have by nature no feeling that arises above the trifling. ... So \nfundamental is the difference between these two races of man, and it appears to be \nas great in regard to mental capacities as in colour. . . The blacks are very vain but \nin the Negro\u2019s way, and so talkative that they must be driven apart from each other \nwith thrashings.\u2019  Kant (1991) \nAs Gilroy succinctly states, Kant\u2019s \u2018democratic hopes and dreams simply could not \nencompass black humanity\u2019 (2000, page 60). Race ideology is embedded in the legacies of \nKant, Hegel, Nietzsche where for many of these figures, affect and emotions are at the heart \nof definitions of \u2018man\u2019 (Buck-Morss, 2002), but also of \u2018beauty\u2019, \u2018literature\u2019, \u2018art\u2019  and \n\u2018nature\u2019 itself. A historical memory of the basis of scientific taxonomies in an era of universal \ntheories of the rights of man, is necessary. Buck-Morss reflecting on Rousseau\u2019s concealing \nof the presence of slavery states that \u2018today\u2019s philosopher, who is trained to analyse theory \ntotally abstracted from historical context will inevitably attribute a universality to \nRousseau\u2019s writings\u2019 (2000, page 821). Code (2006) has argued, these types of philosophical \norientations have often resulted in epistemic violence against \u2018others\u2019. What is necessary \nwithin the social sciences, therefore is not a simple engagement with theories of affect and \nemotion, but a situated understanding of these through a genealogical account of the \nemergence of the figure of \u2018man\u2019 and \u2018his\u2019 affective capacities can be derived. \n \nThe turn to the transpersonal and transhuman might at first seem to offer a move beyond \nthese legacies of the figure of \u2018man.\u2019 And indeed this is often an intent behind the \ninvocation of Leibnizean flavoured monism; to flatten hierarchical taxonomies by seeing \nhumans, animals and things as existing on the same strata and of the same substance. \nHowever along with the gains come the risks of a language and approach effecting \u2018an \nextensive indifference between the countless objects of the world (human and nonhuman), \nsubsequently ending up portraying them as potentially all the same\u2019 and recollecting \nprevious vocabularies that dehumanised geography in the name of a geometric language of \nabstract forces (Simonsen 2004, page 1335). There is then a problematic politics to the \nposthuman elements of the affective turn; a politics which leads inevitably to which human \nstates are to be abandoned (Thien 2005). In this respect there is an element of a continuing \nuniversalism framing arguments on the affective (Tolia-Kelly 2006 ). However there are \nareas where visceral affects and capacities are the site of inquiry; these are sites where \nthere is a positive challenge to the prejudicial philosophical orientations that have gone \nbefore (Conradson and Latham, 2005; 2007; Conradson and MacKay, 2007). As Simonsen \nnotes, \u2018the fleshy world of other bodies... is not a general world of humanity, but a \ndifferentiated world, and in such a world ... [e]ncounters with other bodies therefore \ninvolve practices and techniques of differentiation\u2019 (2007, page 177). We need a theory of \naffect that is historically conscious and sensitised to power, where the shared substance of \nLeibniz is an invitation to new ethical action, where: \n\u2018folds and monads open up a space for those who bring to the event histories of \nfear, oppression or undesirability to fold these histories together with new affects \n\u2026 and thus to unfold new modes of relating in the world. Such a practice of thought \nis not solely about forging an ethical approach to acting in the (future) event, but \nalso involves how we make sense of the event, in retrospect, through our \nhistoricising practice.\u2019  (Lim, 2008,page 233) \n \nParadoxical positionings, questions opening: \n \nThe current moment of debate then is one of opportunity and danger. Firstly there is a need \nto engage with debates over the biological elements of race while facing the risk of re-\nentering an age of both biological essentialism but also, secondly, of creating social \nreferents and discourses that become sedimented and systemically entrap citizens of colour \ninto a positioning (social, cultural, economic) which is figured through their colour. How do \nwe materialise race in ways that grasp the vitality of bodies, the corporeality of emotion in \nthe face of the narratives of race, of phenotype that fix the marked body through a different \nregime of truth and value, postcolonial, yet fundamentally biologic. \n \nThird, how do we address the relation of emotional and affective dimensions? If we divide \nthem and align affect with the pre-cognate and emotions with individual reflection then that \nsurely \u2018misses how that which is not consciously recognised might still be mediated by past \nexperiences, and on the other hand it risks cutting off emotions from the lived experience of \nbeing and from having a body\u2019 (Simonsen 2007, page 176). Fourthly, and relatedly, we need \nto think of how affect divides and sediments, as well as energises and flows \u2013 and how those \npatterns may be all too familiar. \n \nThis special issue on Affect, Race and Identities originates from a symposium, held at \nDurham Geography department that tried to open a conversation to address these issues. \nThe intellectual agenda at the symposium focussed on three sub-themes of identity politics: \n(i) that of \u2018non-representational theory and affect\u2019 (ii) thinking \u2018Race and ethnicity\u2019 via praxis \nand (iii) Post-Marxist theories of power, politics and struggles for equality and an ethics of \ncare.  Lim and Swanton in particular exemplify how theories of affect can be transformative \nfor new theorisations of ethnicity, identity and race. They attend to the stubbornness and \nstickiness of some categories that pervade the day-to-day. Their more than human \ngeographies look at the affective economy binding peoples, things and racialisation. All the \nwriters attend to a notion of an embodied ethical practice embedded within affective \nmodes of being. They steer us towards recognising the potential for a new politics of care \nand the \u2018progressive\u2019 struggle to engender anti-racist action in everyday life. Saldanha \ndirectly attends to the material categorisation of phenotype, in his account of bodies. His \napproach enables us to think through the power politics of race, thus relocating political \nunderstandings of affect and emotion in differently powerful, racialised bodies. The issue of \nthe spatial scale of terms and identity is taken up by Bonnett in his piece where he \ninvestigates the politics of the left and locates a \u2018white nostalgia\u2019 in the political manifestos \nof particular left communities and their practice. Bonnett exposes the contradictory notions \nof an \u2018internationalist\u2019 imperative of this group and their particularly parochial nostalgia \nwhich is historicised through the consideration of key political texts as evidence. Nayak \nsimilarly researches the discourses and sensibilities\u2019 of racialised groups within urban street \nculture, with a focus on the ways in which \u2018Chav\u2019 culture reflects that of subcultures that \nhave gone before \u2013 demonised as a lament against the failure of a mythical consensus of \nnationhood and national culture. Tolia-Kelly and Crang reflect critically on the potentialities \nof theories of affect and race, and their sedimentation in work on cultures of heritage and \nnation. Finally, Thrift\u2019s commentary responds to the perceived particularity of affectual \nwork, unpacking its universal claims and appropriations and reinserting it in a realm of \neconomic inequality and power. The papers collectively chart geographies of the circulation, \ncontagion and transmission of racialised affects, alongside their solidifications, \nsequestrations, and accumulations. They show how race is necessarily a matter of affect and \naffect does not walk innocently of race. \n \n \nReferences: \n Ahmed S 2004a Affective Economies Social Text 22 114-39 \nAhmed S 2004b Collective Feelings: Or The Impressions Left By Others Theory Culture And \nSociety 21 25-42 \nAnderson K (2007),  Race and the crisis of Humanism, 2007, (Routledge, Oxford) \nAnderson K and Smith S J 2001 Emotional Geographies Transactions Of The Institute Of \nBritish Geographers 26 7-10 \nBeddoe, J. 1971 [1885].
