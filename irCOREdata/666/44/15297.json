Allen 4 \nDepartment of Earth Sciences, University of Durham, Durham, DH1 3LE, UK 5 \n 6 \nAbstract: This paper concerns the kinematics of active strike-slip faults in the Arabia-7 \nEurasia collision zone, and how they accommodate plate convergence. Several roles 8 \nare discernible. 1) Collision zone boundaries \u2013 the left-lateral Dead Sea Fault System 9 \nand right-lateral faults in eastern Iran form the western and eastern boundaries of the 10 \ncollision zone. 2) Tectonic escape structures \u2013 the North and East Anatolian faults 11 \ntransport intervening crust westwards, out of the path of the Arabia. 3) Strain 12 \npartitioning \u2013 right-lateral slip on the Zagros Main Recent Fault and NW-SE striking 13 \nthrusts to its SW produce north-south convergence, parallel to the plate vector. Left-14 \nlateral slip along the Alborz range and thrusts across it produce oblique left-lateral 15 \nshortening. 4) Shortening arrays \u2013 arrays of strike-slip faults (e.g. Kopeh Dagh and 16 \neastern Iran) rotate about vertical axes, producing north-south shortening without 17 \ncrustal thickening. 5) Transfer zones \u2013 fold trends and earthquake slip vectors change 18 \norientation across strike-slip faults in the Zagros, suggesting that these faults allow for 19 \nchanges in thrust transport along strike in the orogen. These different roles emphasise 20 \nthe complex behaviour of continental crust, and the advantages of studying active 21 \ntectonics rather than ancient examples.  22 \n 23 \nIntroduction 24 \n13\/05\/2009 \n2 \nThis paper reviews active strike-slip faults from the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone 25 \n(Figures 1, 2 & 3), to summarise the different ways such faults help achieve plate 26 \nconvergence during continent-continent collision. This is an important issue for two 27 \nreasons. The first is that it is part of the more general problem of how faults in the 28 \nupper crust collectively produce the velocity fields required by plate motions. The 29 \nsecond is that strike-slip faults are common features in the geological record of the 30 \ncontinents, but it is not always easy to determine why such faulting took place. Active 31 \ntectonics provides data and constraints not available in ancient settings, principally 32 \nthrough studies of decadal to millennial slip vectors (via GPS and seismicity studies) 33 \nand through use of the landscape to deduce deformation patterns. The approach is to 34 \nuse case studies from different regions to make general conclusions about the way the 35 \nstrike-slip faults in the upper crust behave during continental deformation. It is not 36 \nintended to be a systematic account of every active strike-slip fault in SW Asia, nor 37 \ndoes it dwell on the many other aspects of the collision. Other papers (e.g. Mann, 38 \n2007) synthesise the structures associated with continental strike-slip faults, 39 \nregardless of their origins: such material is not repeated here. 40 \n 41 \nActive slip rates and finite offsets are known for many of the strike-slip faults, and in 42 \nsome cases there are data for the timing of onset. Therefore it is possible to compare 43 \nthe patterns of short-term and long-term deformation in the collision zone, and by 44 \nimplication in continental crust in general. Strike-slip faults are easier to work with in 45 \nthis respect than thrusts or normal faults, where the overall shortening or extension 46 \nmay be poorly constrained through lack of sub-surface data. 47 \n 48 \n13\/05\/2009 \n3 \nContinental collision zones are excellent places in which to study continental 49 \ndeformation processes in general because of the widespread and highly variable 50 \nnature of the deformation that takes place. Although collision by definition implies 51 \nplate convergence, this can be accommodated in a tremendous variety of ways by 52 \ncombinations of compressional, strike-slip and even extensional structures (Dewey et 53 \nal., 1986). Faulting is the main way in which strain is accomplished within the brittle 54 \nupper crust, therefore the kinematics of fault zones are revealing about overall strain. 55 \nHowever, there are few active continental collision zones in the world, compared with 56 \nactive subduction zone boundaries for example. One is the Arabia-Eurasia collision, 57 \npart way along the network of Cenozoic orogenic belts between the Pyrenees and SE 58 \nAsia known collectively as the Alpine-Himalayan system. Following a geological 59 \noverview of the collision, later sections focus on individual faults and groups of 60 \nfaults, to show how their kinematics fit in to the overall plate convergence. Figure 3 is 61 \na summary map of the main active strike-slip faults in the Arabia-Eurasia collision, 62 \nbut also highlights the generic roles outlined in this paper, namely: collision zone 63 \nboundaries (Dead Sea Fault system, eastern Iranian faults); tectonic escape structures 64 \n(North and East Anatolian faults); strain partitioning elements (Main Recent Fault of 65 \nthe Zagros; Mosha Fault in the Alborz); shortening arrays (Kopeh Dagh); transfer and 66 \ntear faults (Sangavar Fault). 67 \n 68 \nGeological background 69 \nCollision between Arabia and Eurasia initially took place along the Bitlis-Zagros 70 \nsuture, which curves through SE Turkey before running NW-SE through southern 71 \nIran (Figure 1). The plate boundaries were a passive continental margin on the 72 \n13\/05\/2009 \n4 \nnorthern side of the Arabian plate and an active continental margin along southern 73 \nEurasia (\u015eeng\u00f6r et al., 1988; Beydoun et al., 1992). 74 \n 75 \nThe plate scale present-day convergence between Arabia and Eurasia is well-76 \nunderstood: GPS studies show that roughly 18\u00b12 mm\/yr north-south convergence 77 \ntakes place between the stable interiors of Arabia and Eurasia at longitude 48oE 78 \n(Figure 1; McClusky et al., 2000). Convergence velocities increase and azimuths 79 \nswing anti-clockwise west to east along the collision zone, with a rotation pole in the 80 \nnortheast Africa\/eastern Mediterranean region (McClusky et al., 2003) and velocities 81 \n~10 mm\/yr higher in eastern Iran than the western side of the collision. GPS and 82 \nseismicity studies together show that deformation is concentrated between the Persian 83 \nGulf and the north side of the Greater Caucasus and Kopeh Dagh ranges \u2013 there is a 84 \ngood correlation between the limits of seismicity and topographic fronts (Figure 2). 85 \nBut deformation is not distributed evenly within these northern and southern limits. 86 \nSeismogenic thrusting, and hence plate convergence achieved by crustal shortening 87 \nand thickening, is presently concentrated in areas below the 1 km topographic contour 88 \n(Talebian and Jackson, 2004). This is mainly within the lower parts of the Zagros and 89 \nAlborz\/Caucasus regions at the southern and northern sides of the collision 90 \nrespectively (Figure 3). The intervening region has lower relief, elevations commonly 91 \nover 1.5 km and is known as the Turkish-Iranian plateau. GPS data from within the 92 \ncollision zone reveal that little active internal shortening takes place within this 93 \nplateau (~2 mm\/yr or less; Vernant et al., 2004a), and large areas are aseismic. It is 94 \nnot totally quiescent: Late Cenozoic volcanics occur in discrete fields across it (Pearce 95 \net al., 1990; Kheirkhah et al., 2009), and strike-slip faults are locally associated with 96 \nhistorical earthquakes, indicating at least some tectonic activity (Copley and Jackson, 97 \n13\/05\/2009 \n5 \n2006). Another area of low internal deformation at present is the South Caspian 98 \nBasin, north of the Alborz (Figure 3). Para-oceanic basement to this basin is in the 99 \nearly stages of subducting under the northern and possibly western basin margins 100 \n(Mangino and Priestley, 1998; Jackson et al., 2002). This basement is detached from 101 \nfolds within the thick sedimentary cover: these folds are not typically associated with 102 \nmajor seismicity, indicating that the basement behaves as a rigid block, presumably 103 \nbecause of unusually strong basement. 104 \n 105 \nThe western margin of the collision zone is sharply defined along the Dead Sea Fault 106 \nSystem, which allows the largely stable interior of Arabia to move northwards with 107 \nrespect to the eastern Mediterranean. This basement to the latter area is not well 108 \nknown as it is buried beneath a thick sedimentary cover, including salt. It is probably 109 \nunderlain by highly thinned continental or even oceanic crust (de Voogd et al., 1992). 110 \nWest of a triple junction at the northern end of the Dead Sea Fault System, subduction 111 \nof eastern Mediterranean basement takes places along the Cypriot and Hellenic arcs. 112 \nCollision has not yet taken place in these regions, and north of the Hellenic arc the 113 \nAegean crust is rapidly extending. This extensional province merges eastwards in 114 \nonshore Turkey, in to the crust of Anatolia. Here there is little active internal 115 \ndeformation, but wholesale westwards transport between the North and East 116 \nAnatolian faults (McKenzie, 1972). The eastern side of the collision roughly 117 \ncoincides with the political boundary of Iran and Afghanistan; the latter is part of 118 \nstable Eurasia, in the context of the active deformation field. There is active 119 \nsubduction of Indian plate oceanic lithosphere under the Makran (Regard et al., 2005). 120 \n 121 \n13\/05\/2009 \n6 \nLess is known about the earlier evolution of the collision zone. Even the onset of 122 \ncollision is debated, with recent estimates ranging from Late Eocene (~35 Ma) to mid-123 \nlate Miocene (12-10 Ma) (McQuarrie et al., 2003; Vincent et al., 2005; Guest et al., 124 \n2006a; Verdel et al., 2007). Allen & Armstrong (2008) proposed that there was 125 \nevidence from many localities both sides of the original suture for Late Eocene (~35 126 \nMa) deformation, uplift or changing sedimentation patterns, and that this was the true 127 \ntime of initial collision. This debate on the collision timing highlights how difficult it 128 \ncan be to interpret geological data from ancient settings. It arises in part because we 129 \ncan never have an overview for past times across the entire orogen, in the way that 130 \nremote sensing, seismicity and GPS all provide for the active tectonics. Therefore data 131 \nfrom one region for initial rock uplift, say, can get treated as though it is 132 \nrepresentative of the entire collision zone. This is misguided, given how the present 133 \nday tectonics show the wide variety of deformation, and quiescence, that takes place 134 \nat any one time.  135 \n 136 \nAs a general point, there is no systematic difference in the depths of the strike-slip and 137 \nthrust earthquakes in the various regions of the collision zone, such as the Alborz and 138 \nZagros ranges (Figure 3). They are typically up to ~15-20 km, i.e. within the 139 \ncrystalline basement of the crust (Jackson et al., 2002; Talebian & Jackson, 2004). 140 \nThis indicates that the strike-slip deformation described in this paper is \u201cthick-141 \nskinned\u201d in structural geology terms. 142 \n 143 \nCollision zone boundaries 144 \nReduced to its simplest, the Arabia-Eurasia collision represents ~north-south 145 \nconvergence between a promontory (Arabia) and a much broader continental mass 146 \n13\/05\/2009 \n7 \n(Eurasia). Figure 4 is a cartoon that highlights the main elements of the collision, and 147 \nillustrates the role of strike-slip faults and the boundaries of deformation. The real 148 \nlocations of these structures are shown on Figure 3. The pre-collision position of the 149 \nArabian and Eurasian plate margins is not precisely known, but the north-south 150 \nconvergence vector requires hundreds of kilometres of northwards motion of the 151 \nstable interior of Arabia with respect to stable Eurasia, over tens of millions of years 152 \n(McQuarrie et al., 2003; Allen & Armstrong, 2008). Therefore it is unsurprising that 153 \nthe northern and southern limits to deformation are marked by thrusting (Figure 2) \u2013 154 \nallowing for plate convergence via crustal thickening, whereas the western and 155 \neastern limits are strike-slip fault zones \u2013 allowing the Arabian plate to move past 156 \nadjacent crust. A crucial difference between the strike-slip faults on the western and 157 \neastern margins of the collision is that the former, the Dead Sea Fault System, 158 \ndecouples Arabia from the eastern Mediterranean, but both regions were part of the 159 \ncombined African-Arabian plate before collision. In the case of the east Iranian faults, 160 \nthe great majority of the region involved was part of Eurasia before the initial 161 \ncollision. 162 \n 163 \nDeformation is sharply focused along the ~1000 km long, left-lateral Dead Sea Fault 164 \nSystem (Garfunkel, 1981; Figure 3), except for local splays at releasing and 165 \nrestraining bends such as the Dead Sea pull-apart basin (Manspeizer, 1985) and the 166 \nMount Lebanon range. The southern end of the fault links in to the active extension 167 \nwithin the Red Sea: debate continues as to the interaction of extension in this region 168 \nand initial collision on the northern side of the Arabian plate (Jolivet and Faccenna, 169 \n2000; McQuarrie et al., 2003). The northern end links in to the folds and thrust belts 170 \nin southeastern Anatolia and the Zagros. Total offset across the fault is ~105 km south 171 \n13\/05\/2009 \n8 \nof the Dead Sea (Quennell, 1958), and this is fully observed in an offset dyke swarm 172 \ndated at 22-18 Ma (Eyal et al., 1981). Active and late Quaternary slip rate estimates 173 \nare variable, at 2-8 mm\/yr (e.g. Klinger et al., 2000), although more recent studies are 174 \nproducing values of ~5 mm\/yr (Ferry et al., 2007; Gomez et al., 2007). This velocity 175 \nwould need ~20 million years to achieve the full offset, consistent with the age of the 176 \noffset dykes, but inconsistent with the fault having operated at this slip rate since the 177 \nproposed Late Eocene start of collision.  178 \n  179 \nNorth-south right-lateral faulting in eastern Iran form the eastern boundary to the 180 \ncollsion zone (Figures 1-3). Oceanic subduction takes place under the Makran region, 181 \nsuch that right-lateral faults in the extreme southeast of Iran juxtapose the easternmost 182 \nZagros (originating on the Arabian passive margin) with the accretionary prism to the 183 \neast (Regard et al., 2005; Bayer et al., 2006). Further north, right-lateral faults to the 184 \neast (Neh and Zahedan) and west (Nayband and Gowk) of the inert Dasht-e-Lut have 185 \na total offset estimated by Walker and Jackson (2004) as ~80 km. A difference 186 \nbetween the eastern and western margins to the collision zone is that in the west there 187 \nis only one, whereas in eastern Iran there are at least two active, parallel fault systems, 188 \nand possibly several more. There is little doubt that the Nayband and Gowk faults and 189 \nthe Neh and Zahedan faults take up most of the slip between Iran and Afghanistan 190 \n(Walker and Jackson, 2004; Walker et al., 2009), but the Deh Shir, Anar and Kuh 191 \nBahnan faults are also active (Meyer, 2006; Meyer and LeDortz, 2007), plausibly slip 192 \nat 1-2 mm\/yr in the Holocene, and so may contribute part of the overall shear. A more 193 \nfundamental problem is why deformation is so focused at the western collision 194 \nmargin, and distributed in the east. The reason may be the distinct contrast in crustal 195 \ntype at the western side, where the Arabian crust was juxtaposed with para-oceanic 196 \n13\/05\/2009 \n9 \nbasement to the eastern Mediterranean long before initial collision, when both regions 197 \nformed part of the passive margin at the northern side of the African-Arabian plate. In 198 \neastern Iran and Afghanistan there is a mosaic of similar Gondwana-derived basement 199 \nblocks (\u015eeng\u00f6r et al., 1988). Those blocks east of the Arabian indentor are not being 200 \ndeformed by the Arabia-Eurasia collision, but there is no sharp contrast within this 201 \ncrust as there is in the west.  202 \n 203 \nThe GPS derived right-lateral shear between eastern Iran and Afghanistan is ~16 204 \nmm\/yr (Vernant et al., 2004a). This only requires 5 million years to achieve the total 205 \nobserved offset along the Neh\/Zahedan and Nayband\/Gowk faults. Given that all 206 \nestimates of the initial collision put it much earlier than 5 Ma, something else 207 \naccomplished right-lateral shear at the eastern side of the collision. The obvious 208 \nexplanation is that the region must contain faults that are now inactive, or only weakly 209 \nactive. The Deh Shir, Anar and Kuh-e Bahnan faults may have contributed relatively 210 \nmore to the boundary shear in the past, regardless of their precise present 211 \ncontribution. There may be further structures within the deserts of eastern Iran as yet 212 \nunquantified or unrecognised. 213 \n 214 \nTectonic escape structures 215 \nThe Arabia-Eurasia collision zone contains the first recognised example of so-called 216 \nescape tectonics, in the case of Anatolian crust between the North and east Anatolian 217 \nfaults (McKenzie, 1972). These are active right- and left-lateral faults respectively, 218 \nand act to transport intervening crust westwards, largely without internal deformation 219 \n(Figure 1). Figure 4 reduces the kinematics to their simplest. The left-lateral East 220 \nAnatolian Fault is the boundary between Arabia and Anatolia (Figure 3), and runs for 221 \n13\/05\/2009 \n10 \n~400 km southwest of its intersection with the North Anatolian Fault at Karliova, at 222 \napproximately 39.5o N 41o E. There are several strands to the fault zone, with 223 \nlocalized pull-apart basins and push-up zones (Lyberis et al., 1992; Westaway, 1994). 224 \nThe GPS-derived slip rate is 9\u00b11 mm yr-1 (McClusky et al., 2000) only needs to 225 \noperate for ~3 million years to achieve the geological offset of  27-33 km (Westaway 226 \nand Arger, 1996; Westaway et al., 2006), constrained by offset geological markers. 227 \nThis is in good agreement with the age of initial offset as late Pliocene (~3 Ma) or 228 \nyounger (\u015earo\u011flu et al., 1992; Westaway and Arger, 2001), based on the offset of 229 \nvolcanics of this age.  230 \n 231 \nThe right-lateral North Anatolian Fault (NAF) achieves the slip between Eurasian and 232 \nAnatolian crust for >1200 km (Figures 1 and 2), at a GPS-derived slip rate of 24\u00b11 233 \nmm yr-1 (McClusky et al., 2000). The western end of the fault splits where it enters 234 \nthe north Aegean and passes in to the extensional deformation in that region. Roughly 235 \n80-85 km is emerging as a consensus figure for the total offset of most of the length 236 \nof the fault zone, based on combinations of geological and drainage offsets (Armijo et 237 \nal., 1999; Westaway, 1994; Seymen, 1975). Distributed strike-slip and\/or extension 238 \ntook place in the mid or late Miocene, before the establishment of the present fault 239 \ntrace in some regions (e.g. Barka and Hancock, 1984; T\u00fcys\u00fcz et al., 1998; Coskun, 240 \n2000; \u015eeng\u00f6r et al., 2005). There is no consensus on a precise age for the start of 241 \nmotion on the NAF, despite several estimates of ~5 Ma (see Bozkurt, 2001).  The 242 \nGPS-derived slip rate (24\u00b11 mm\/yr) achieves the total offset of 80-85 km in only ~3.5 243 \nmillion years, less than most geological estimates for the fault age. It seems that: i) the 244 \nslip-rate is higher now than in the past (but this is uncertain), and ii) the fault has not 245 \nbeen active since the start of collision (this is more definite). 246 \n13\/05\/2009 \n11 \n 247 \nLike the Dead Sea Fault System, the narrowness of both the NAF and EAF and the 248 \nsharp velocity contrasts across them resemble plate boundaries, as utilised as long ago 249 \nas McKenzie (1972) in his vector calculations. But this is a nearly instantaneous 250 \npicture, and it is striking that both faults are young with respect to the overall collision 251 \nzone, and need only a few million years at their present slip rates to achieve their total 252 \noffset. In the case of the EAF, other faults may have played similar kinematic roles in 253 \nthe past. Other (inactive?) left-lateral faults have been identified in eastern Turkey, 254 \nsuch as the Malatya-Ovacik Fault (Westaway and Arger, 2001), with ~29 km offset 255 \nbetween 3-5 Ma, and the Ecemi\u015f Fault (Jaffey and Robertson, 2001), with ~60 km 256 \noffset, mainly between the Late Eocene and Miocene. Activity on the Central 257 \nAnatolian Fault (Kocyigit and Beyhan, 1998) is disputed (Westaway, 1999). 258 \nHowever, as the triple junction at the eastern end of NAF and EAF should migrate 259 \nwest with time, it is difficult to see how any of these inactive left-lateral faults in 260 \neastern Anatolia were the precise equivalent of the modern EAF. 261 \n 262 \nElements in strain partitioning 263 \nPlate boundaries are rarely orthogonal to plate vectors (Woodcock, 1986). This fact 264 \nunderlies the origins of many continental strike-slip faults, not only in collision zones. 265 \nAccommodation of north-south convergence by east-west trending faults would be 266 \nlikely in idealised, isotropic crust, but has not happened in the heterogeneous crust of 267 \nboth Arabia and Eurasia. The suture zone trends NW-SE for much of its length 268 \n(mainly within Iran), at roughly 45o to the plate convergence vector. Pre-collision 269 \nstructural fabrics commonly lie parallel to the suture within both plates (e.g. 270 \nSarkarinejad et al., 2008). The pattern of active faulting in the Zagros strongly 271 \n13\/05\/2009 \n12 \nsuggests pre-collision normal faults in the Arabian passive margin are now active as 272 \nthrusts. Conclusive evidence for individual fault reactivation is rarely available, 273 \nlargely because of a thick sediment carapace over blind thrusts, but most folds and 274 \nthrusts in the northwest Zagros trend NW-SE, parallel to both the suture and the trend 275 \nof pre-collision sediment isopachs (Beydoun, 1992). The resultant NE-SW shortening 276 \nis therefore oblique to the north-south plate convergence, and cannot achieve it on its 277 \nown. The answer is the combination of this thrusting with adjacent strike-slip faulting, 278 \nin an example of so-called strain partitioning (Figure 4). 279 \n 280 \nAlong the northeast side of the Zagros, loosely along the line of the original suture, 281 \nthere is a right-lateral strike-slip fault, the Main Recent Fault (MRF) (Talebian and 282 \nJackson, 2002; Figure 3). Offset along the MRF is ~50 km (Talebian and Jackson, 283 \n2002). Shortening across the widest structural unit in the Zagros, the Simple Folded 284 \nZone, is similar in magnitude (Blanc et al., 2003; McQuarrie, 2004). Combining the 285 \ntwo estimates suggests ~70 km of north-south convergence across the Zagros, by 286 \napplying Pythagoras\u2019 rule (Figure 5A). This is only valid if the strains took place at 287 \nthe same time. It is clear that shortening across the Zagros is active, and focused on 288 \nlower elevations (<1 km) in the Simple Folded Zone. Vernant et al. (2004a) estimated 289 \n6.5\u00b12 mm\/yr north-south convergence at longitude ~51oE, in their GPS survey of 290 \nIran. Likewise, both seismicity and GPS data indicate right-lateral slip along the Main 291 \nRecent Fault, and the difference in slip vector azimuths between the Main Recent 292 \nFault and the Simple Folded Zone emphasise the effectiveness of partitioning. But the 293 \nactive slip rates do not fit a Pythagorean triangle as neatly as the total displacements, 294 \nbecause GPS-derived slip along the MRF is only 3\u00b12 mm\/yr (Vernant et al., 2004a). 295 \nThis is less than the expected \u226510 mm\/yr, if the onset of slip was \u22645 Ma (Talebian and 296 \n13\/05\/2009 \n13 \nJackson, 2004). A further complication is that the Simple Folded Zone deformation 297 \nmay have begun earlier than 5 Ma, as suggested by syn-fold deposition at ~8 Ma near 298 \nthe Zagros foreland (Homke et al., 2004). 299 \n 300 \nAnother example of strain partitioning in the active collision zone is from the Alborz 301 \nmountains of northern Iran (Jackson et al., 2002; Allen et al., 2003; Guest et al., 302 \n2006b). This range lies between the Turkish-Iranian plateau to the south and the South 303 \nCaspian Basin to the north (Figure 3). It is actively thrusting to both the north and 304 \nsouth, and cut by range-parallel left-lateral strike-slip faults with offsets in the order 305 \nof several tens of kilometres (Mosha, Astaneh; Figure 6) (Allen et al., 2003; Ritz et 306 \nal., 2006; Hollingsworth et al., 2008). These are apparently segmented along strike, 307 \nand at least locally more than one parallel fault segment is active \u2013 such as the 308 \nDamghan Fault south of the longer Astaneh Fault. The resultant oblique motion 309 \nacross the range allows for westward motion of the rigid South Caspian basement 310 \nwith respect to Iran. Like the Zagros, the variation in earthquake slip vector azimuths 311 \nhelps make the case for effective strain partitioning (Jackson et al., 2002). Thus in 312 \ncontrast to the Zagros example, the strike-slip component of oblique shortening takes 313 \nplace predominantly within the thrust belt (Figures 5B and 6). Vernant et al. (2004b) 314 \ndetermined the north-south shortening rate across the Alborz as 5\u00b12 mm\/yr and the 315 \nleft-lateral shear as 4\u00b12 mm\/yr, from a GPS study. Ritz et al. (2006) identified an 316 \nextensional component on some of the left-lateral faults, which they suggested 317 \nrepresented a Quaternary re-organisation of the deformation. 318 \n 319 \nThere is evidence for older, but probably late Cenozoic, right-lateral faulting along 320 \nparts of the range (Axen et al., 2001; Allen et al., 2003; Guest et al., 2006b; Zanchi et 321 \n13\/05\/2009 \n14 \nal., 2006). Thus at least part of the Alborz strike-slip system shows evidence of rapid 322 \nreversal of its sense of motion, possibly within the last few million years. Given that 323 \nthe folding within the South Caspian cover succession is only a few million years old 324 \nat most (Devlin et al., 1999), the overall westward motion of the South Caspian 325 \nbasement is very young (Jackson et al., 2002), the present fault configuration may be 326 \nas recent as the Quaternary (Ritz et al., 2006). In contrast, Hollingsworth et al. (2008) 327 \nshowed that present slip rates in the eastern Alborz require ~10 million years to 328 \nachieve the total offset, suggesting that the present kinematics go back further in time.  329 \n 330 \nThe combination of left-lateral faulting along the Alborz and right-lateral along the 331 \nZagros has attracted repeated interest over the years, promoting the idea of eastwards 332 \nescape of Iranian crust out of the collision zone, in an apparent mirror image to the 333 \nwestwards transport of Anatolian crust (McKenzie, 1972; Axen et al., 2001; 334 \nBachmanov et al., 2004). Both seismicity data (Jackson et al., 1995) and the GPS-335 \nderived velocity field (Vernant et al., 2004a) show that this is not the case (Figure 1), 336 \nand that the strike-slip faults parallel to each range help accommodate oblique 337 \nconvergence across them (Allen et al., 2006). It the case of the Zagros, the resultant 338 \nconvergence is parallel to the regional plate vector. The Alborz strike-slip relates to 339 \nthe South Caspian basement moving as a rigid block within the collision zone, at a 340 \nhigh angle to the overall plate convergence vector. This case study is a warning for all 341 \ninterpretations of escape tectonics in ancient orogens, where seismicity data and GPS-342 \nvelocity fields are not feasible and the regional plate kinematics are not known: it is 343 \npossible that such settings represent the strike-slip component of strain partitioning as 344 \noutlined here. It should be feasible to distinguish between real and illusory escape 345 \ntectonics, given that an essential component of strain partitioning is an adjacent zone 346 \n13\/05\/2009 \n15 \nof contemporary thrusting. In Anatolia, the neotectonic strike-slip faulting postdates 347 \nprevious thrusting and thickening. 348 \n 349 \nJackson (1992) noted that pure dip slip thrusting in the Greater Caucasus took place 350 \non slip vectors oriented clockwise of the overall convergence vector at this longitude. 351 \nThe overall convergence vector is achieved by combining this shortening in the 352 \nGreater Caucasus with right-lateral strike-slip faulting to the south, within the Lesser 353 \nCaucasus and the interior of the Turkish-Iranian plateau. This is most active in a 354 \nWNW-ENE trending swarm of right-lateral faults including Van (Figure 3). Copley 355 \nand Jackson (2006) also found that an array of NW-SE right-lateral strike-slip faults 356 \naccommodate a NW-SE velocity gradient of NE directed velocity; these faults are 357 \nlocated between the Van and Sevan faults. An aspect of this right-lateral shear within 358 \nthe Turkish-Iranian plateau (south of the Greater Caucasus) is that it is distributed 359 \nacross many faults, rather than focused on one main structure, which is the case to the 360 \nwest and SE in the NAF and Main Recent Fault respectively. In part this may be 361 \nbecause of the presence of linear pre-Cenozoic sutures in the latter areas, available for 362 \nreactivation. But it also relates to the way strain is partitioned across a much wider 363 \narea than either the Zagros or Alborz, with the shortening component in the Greater 364 \nCaucasus located north of the strike-slip faults (Jackson, 1992). The strike-slip fault 365 \nsystem is constantly transported northwards by the shortening in the Greater 366 \nCaucasus, in a way that does not happen in either the Alborz or Zagros. 367 \n 368 \nShortening arrays 369 \nEscape tectonics is one scenario where continental shortening takes place without 370 \ncrustal thickening. Strike-slip faults can achieve crustal shortening in another way, via 371 \n13\/05\/2009 \n16 \narrays of en echelon faults rotating about vertical axes as they slip (Figure 4). The 372 \nsituation has parallels with the behaviour of normal faults in rift zones; in the latter 373 \ncase the faults rotate about horizontal axes as they slip and thin and extend the crust. 374 \nIn the strike-slip setting the net result is shortening across the fault zone and 375 \nlengthening along it. Such fault arrays have recently been recognised in several places 376 \nwithin the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone, mainly by James Jackson and colleagues.  377 \n 378 \nThe Kopeh Dagh in northeastern Iran lies on the northern side of the collision, 379 \nbetween the Turkish-Iranian plateau to the south and the undeformed crust of the 380 \nTuran platform to the north (Figure 3). Its structure is dominated by arcuate but 381 \nbroadly NW-SE trending folds and thrusts, which deform and expose Mesozoic and 382 \nLower Tertiary strata at current exposure levels. The right-lateral and range-parallel 383 \nAshkabad Fault lies along the northeastern margin of the range, trending WNW-ESE, 384 \nsuch that the combination of slip along this fault and shortening\/thickening across the 385 \nrange is another example of strain partitioning in the collision zone (Lyberis and 386 \nManby, 1999). But the folds and thrusts are offset by an en echelon array of right-387 \nlateral faults that strike NNW-SSE or NW-SE (Hollingsworth et al., 2006), such as 388 \nthe Quchan Fault. Palaeomagnetic data are not available to quantify tectonic rotations, 389 \nbut the folds of Mesozoic strata can be traced across the fault zones and the rotations 390 \nthereby quantified. Knowing the rotations and the present dimensions of the fault 391 \narrays allows the total north-south shortening achieved by these faults to be estimated 392 \nas ~60 km (Hollingsworth et al., 2006). The geometry of such a fault array is shown 393 \nschematically on Figure 7. GPS data (Vernant et al. 2004a) put the total north-south 394 \nconvergence across the Kopeh Dagh as ~7 mm\/yr. As there are no detailed estimates 395 \n13\/05\/2009 \n17 \nfor crustal shortening via thrusting and thickening, it is difficult to compare geodetic 396 \nand long-term deformation rates across the range. 397 \n 398 \nA similar fault array exists south of the Kopeh Dagh (Figure 3), at the northern end of 399 \nthe north-south right-lateral structures within eastern Iran, where these faults die out 400 \nand are replaced by left-lateral faults that appear to be rotating clockwise about 401 \nvertical axes (Dasht-e Bayaz and Doruneh; Jackson and McKenzie, 1984; Walker and 402 \nJackson, 2004). The slip along the Deh Shir, Anar and Kuh Bahnan faults further 403 \nsouth again (Figure 3) may be another example of this behaviour (Walker and 404 \nJackson, 2004) and not simply related to the eastern margin of the collision zone 405 \n(Meyer and Le Dortz, 2007). This explanation has the advantage that such faults are 406 \nwell within the interior of Iran, and so seem poorly located to contribute to shear 407 \nresulting from the contrast with Afghanistan beyond the collision zone. At the far 408 \nnorthwest of Iran and in easternmost Turkey a similar right-lateral fault array is active 409 \nand allows for shortening within the tip of the Arabian promontory (Copley and 410 \nJackson, 2006). Other right-lateral faults trend NNE-SSW or NW-SE across central 411 \nIran (e.g. Kashan, Indes). There is limited seismicity on some of these (Figure 2), but 412 \nlittle indication that they contribute much to the overall strain pattern at present. 413 \n 414 \nDeformation in the Greater Caucasus represents the northern component of the 415 \ncollision zone at present. Initial uplift in the range may be as old as Late Eocene 416 \n(Vincent et al., 2007), such that this range carries a longer record of compressional 417 \ndeformation than most parts of the collision zone. Attention has focused on range-418 \nparallel thrusts, held responsible for a present-day convergence rate of ~10 mm\/yr 419 \nacross it (Reilinger et al. 2006). However, there are oblique features within or close to 420 \n13\/05\/2009 \n18 \nthe Greater Caucasus that look like fault zones at high angles to the overall structural 421 \ntrend. In particular, several folds terminate along NW-SE lines, just inland of the 422 \nCaspian shoreline (Figure 3). Other structural breaks have the same orientation in the 423 \nsame region. No offsets are identifiable in the exposed geology, so that it is uncertain 424 \nwhat these trends mean.  425 \n 426 \nTransfer zones and tear faults 427 \nA textbook explanation for strike-slip faults within zones of compressional 428 \ndeformation is that they link along-strike sections of the thrusts, either where the latter 429 \ndie out laterally and strain needs to be relayed to another structure, or because it 430 \nwould be mechanically unfeasible to move the thrust sheets if they were too long. 431 \nSuch strike-slip faults are known as tear faults, or transfer faults. They have not been 432 \nhighlighted within the active fold and thrust belts of the Arabia-Eurasia collision. In 433 \npart this may relate to the blind nature of many thrusts within the Zagros, Alborz, 434 \nCaucasus and Kopeh Dagh: thrust earthquakes do not typically rupture to the surface 435 \nthrough the thick sedimentary cover of these ranges. (This is in contrast to many of 436 \nthe longer strike-slip faults, where earthquake magnitudes can be higher, and surface 437 \nruptures are common for the larger events).  438 \n 439 \nTransfer zones are present on larger scales, although there is potential overlap with 440 \nsome of the other kinematic roles defined in this paper (Figure 4). The Zagros Simple 441 \nFolded Zone is cut by NNW-SSE or NE-SE trending right-lateral faults such as 442 \nKazerun and Sabz Pushan (Figure 8). These have offsets of a few to a few tens of 443 \nkilometres. Higher estimates, based on range-wide structural and geomorphic 444 \ncorrelations (Berberian, 1995) are not confirmed by local studies (Authemayou et al., 445 \n13\/05\/2009 \n19 \n2006). Talebian and Jackson (2004) related these faults to the strike-slip deformation 446 \npresent along the MRF, and the need for lengthening along the Simple Folded Zone as 447 \na result of this slip. This is the same style of behaviour as the rotating fault arrays 448 \ndescribed in the previous section. However, predicted anti-clockwise rotations have 449 \nnot been detected palaeomagnetically (Aubourg et al., 2008). Blanc et al. (2003) noted 450 \nthat the strain partitioning in the NW Zagros does not occur in the east, where folds 451 \nand thrusts are aligned roughly east-west, orthogonal to the convergence vector, with 452 \nno strike-slip equivalent to the motion of the MRF. The strike-slip faults within the 453 \nSimple Folded Zone act to link the zones of strain partitioning and no strain 454 \npartitioning; individual folds cut by the strike-slip faults also change orientation 455 \nacross them, becoming more east-west further east.  456 \n 457 \nAnother scale of transfer behaviour occurs at the western side of the Alborz, where 458 \nthe north-south right-lateral Sangavar Fault (Berberian and Yeats, 1999) links the 459 \nAlborz to the folds and thrusts in the Talesh (Talysh) range to the north (Figure 9). 460 \nThe arcuate and highly three dimensional nature of the structure in this part of the 461 \ncollision zone relates to the rigid basement of the South Caspian Basin, which 462 \nunderthrusts the Talesh to its west on very gently-dipping thrusts (Jackson et al., 463 \n2002). This is superimposed on a component of the regional north-south convergence, 464 \nsuch that the overall kinematics appear highly variable in this region (Masson et al., 465 \n2006), despite the remarkable consistency in the velocity field with respect to Eurasia 466 \n(Figure 9).. Deformation at the southeast corner of the collision zone is similarly 467 \ncomplex, where the eastern Zagros abuts the Makran accretionary prism (Regard et 468 \nal., 2005; Bayer et al., 2006). 469 \n 470 \n13\/05\/2009 \n20 \nDiscussion 471 \nThe examples described above demonstrate the different roles that strike-slip faults 472 \ncan play in one timeframe of one collision zone. Some generalities are possible. 473 \nStrike-slip faults form the boundaries of major deformation zones, where these 474 \ninvolve translation rather than convergence or extension. Strain partitioning involves 475 \nstrike-slip faults acting in concert with adjacent, parallel thrusts to achieve the overall 476 \nconvergence vector required by far field conditions. \u201cFar field\u201d mainly means the 477 \noverall plate convergence zone, but can be rigid blocks moving within it, such as the 478 \nSouth Caspian basement. Such partitioning produces the potential for the mis-479 \ninterpretation of strike-slip faults as tectonic escape structures. Tectonic escape is the 480 \nvalid interpretation for the NAF and EAF, where independent estimates of the 481 \nregional velocity field confirm the westwards transport of Anatolia with respect to 482 \nboth Arabia and Eurasia. This is not the case for central Iran, where strike-slip faults 483 \nalong the Alborz and Zagros ranges work with parallel thrusts to produce oblique 484 \nconvergence across each range. Geoscientists typically think of thrusts as the 485 \npredominant structures in orogens, with mountain building as the result. En echelon 486 \nright-lateral strike-slip faults within Iran show the potential for rotating arrays to 487 \nachieve plate convergence, without crustal thickening. Such arrays are found both 488 \nwithin areas of active thickening (Zagros, Kopeh Dagh, and, possibly, the Greater 489 \nCaucasus), but also within the Turkish-Iranian plateau, where crustal thickening has 490 \nceased. In the latter case, the strike-slip mechanism for convergence has the advantage 491 \nthat it does not require work against gravity, which is important in areas of thickened 492 \nand\/or elevated crust where buoyancy forces oppose crustal thickening. A textbook 493 \nexplanation for strike-slip faults within fold and thrust belts is that they link individual 494 \nthrusts, and ensure the continuity of strain across large regions. Such features have not 495 \n13\/05\/2009 \n21 \nbeen emphasised to date within the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone, but this may be 496 \nbecause many thrusts in actively thickening areas are blind. Larger transfer zones 497 \nexist, linking entire fold and thrust belts such as the western Alborz and southern 498 \nTalesh (Figure 9). 499 \n 500 \nIn Woodcock\u2019s (1986) review of strike-slip faults at plate boundaries, all of the faults 501 \ndescribed in this paper would fall in the type \u201cIndent-linked strike-slip fault\u201d, with the 502 \nexception of the collision zone boundary faults which partly equate to the \u201cBoundary 503 \ntransform\u201d type. The kinematics of the faults within the Arabia-Eurasia collision, and 504 \ninterpretations on the roles they play in plate convergence, permit a more specific 505 \nanalysis. The five categories listed here (collision zone boundaries, tectonic escape 506 \nstructures, strain partitioning elements, shortening arrays and transfer zones; Figure 3) 507 \nare not meant to be rigid. No doubt future studies will allow further refinement. The 508 \ndifferent kinematic roles are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Strike-slip faults in 509 \nthe Zagros link the western and eastern parts of this fold and thrust belt, but also 510 \ncontribute a small amount of shortening across the range (Figure 8). 511 \n  512 \nIn recent years there has been a debate as to whether continental deformation is best 513 \ndescribed by continuum models (where the emphasis is on the smoothness of the 514 \nvelocity field; England and Molnar, 2005), or a rigid block model (where the role of 515 \nindividual fault zones is paramount, and a quasi plate tectonic approach to the 516 \nkinematics is valid; Thatcher, 2007). The Arabia-Eurasia collision has been involved 517 \nin this debate, because of the availability of GPS- and seismicity data on its 518 \ndeformation. Reilinger et al. (2006) modelled the behaviour of the collision zone as a 519 \nseries of blocks, which collectively satisfied the overall velocity field. This approach 520 \n13\/05\/2009 \n22 \ninvolved reducing regions as broad and complex as the Zagros (200-300 km width) to 521 \na single boundary. Liu and Bird (2008) performed a finite element analysis of active 522 \ndeformation between eastern Anatolia and Burma, modelling geodetic data, 523 \ngeological fault slip rates and seismic moment tensor orientations. They showed that 524 \nthroughout the entire collision zone deformation was distributed, with only a few 525 \nembedded rigid blocks, such as the South Caspian and Black Sea basins. These have 526 \npara-oceanic basement distinct from the surrounding continental crust. The derived 527 \nanelastic strain rate (0.7% per Ma) across the collision zone, apart from these rare 528 \nblocks, is inconsistent with a rigid microplate model.  529 \n 530 \nThe two approaches outlined above produce radically different results. Each is correct 531 \nin the technical sense that the data are properly handled in the framework of the 532 \nmodel parameters. As Thatcher (2007) noted, the transition between the two end 533 \nmember behaviours is blurred: as fault number increases, block size decreases. The 534 \nimportant question is, which is the more realistic model of continental behaviour, 535 \ngiven the way faulting is distributed across the continental crust in the active 536 \nexamples we have available for study? In this context it is not only the number of 537 \nfault zones within the Arabia-Eurasia collision that is notable, but their ability to 538 \nrotate, reverse, accelerate or die within geologically short length- and timescales. 539 \nSuch mobility indicates a distributed model is the more useful way of understanding 540 \nthe deformation, rather than reduction to a small number of rigid microplates. Most of 541 \nthis review has focused on active or at least late Quaternary deformation, because of 542 \nthe wealth of data available for fault slip rates on these timescales. But a satisfactory 543 \ndescription of how deformation occurs within the continents may only appear when 544 \nwe have enough data on the pre-neotectonic kinematics. To apply the phrase Brian 545 \n13\/05\/2009 \n23 \nWindley has made famous, their behaviour cannot be summarised by a snapshot, the 546 \nkey lies in how the continents evolve. 547 \n 548 \nAcknowledgements 549 \nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge and thank Brian Windley for his support and guidance 550 \nover the last two decades.

Activity on strike-slip faults in much of Anatolia is debated (e.g. 862 \nKocyigit and Beyhan, 1998, and Westaway, 1999), so that the Eskisehir and Central 863 \nAnatolian faults are marked by dashed lines, and others shown by Bozkurt (2001) and 864 \nKocyigit et al. (2001) are not shown at all. The Salanda Fault is in the vicinity of a 865 \nstrike-slip earthquake of 1938 (Jackson and McKenzie, 1984), and so is more 866 \nconfidently assigned as active. Barbed lines show active thrust fronts, schematically. 867 \n13\/05\/2009 \n37 \nThrust zones are typically harder to map as precisely, because many of the active 868 \nthrusts are blind. White barbs are subduction zones at the margins of the South 869 \nCaspian Basin and Makran and along the Cypriot and Helenic arcs. Red Sea oceanic 870 \nspreading is shown schematically by the double line. 871 \n 872 \nFigure 4. Schematised kinematics of a continent-continent collision between plates X 873 \nand Y, modelled after the Arabia-Eurasia collision and showing westward tectonic 874 \nescape of block Z (i.e. Anatolia) and lateral strike-slip faults at the western and 875 \neastern boundary zones. Solid triangles indicate thrusts at the margins of the collision 876 \nzone; open triangles indicate adjacent subduction zones. Thick black arrows indicate 877 \nvelocities with respect to the stable interior of block Y, with length proportional to 878 \nvelocity. The five roles of strike-slip faults described in this paper are highlighted as 879 \nfollows: (1) Collision zone boundaries \u2013 either diffuse or focussed (2) Tectonic escape 880 \nstructures (3) Strain partitioning elements (4) Shortening arrays with vertical axis 881 \nrotations (5) Transfer zones. 882 \n 883 \nFigure 5. The concept of strain partitioning: A) combined slip on the strike-slip fault 884 \nand shortening across the adjacent thrust belt produces net convergence oblique to the 885 \nfault trends \u2013 northwards motion of block X with respect to Y. This scenario is similar 886 \nto the northwest Zagros Simple Folded Zone. B) Strain partitioning where the strike-887 \nslip fault system lies within the interior of the thrust zone. This geometry is similar to 888 \nthe Alborz mountains. 889 \n 890 \nFigure 6. Active faults in the Alborz between 51o and 55o E. Left-lateral faulting 891 \noccurs within the range interior, principally on the Taleghan, Mosha, Firuzkuh, and 892 \n13\/05\/2009 \n38 \nAstaneh faults, which collectively form a segmented fault system. Thrusting takes 893 \nplace on inward-dipping faults at both the northern and southern margins of the range. 894 \nThe continuity of the Khazar Fault may be an artefact of Caspian lake highstands 895 \nbevelling southwards against the bedrock of the range: the thrust is blind. Map 896 \nderived from Allen et al. (2003), Ritz et al. (2006), Hollingsworth et al. (2008) and 897 \nanalysis of SRTM digital topography; focal mechanisms from Jackson et al. (2002) 898 \nand Tatar et al. (2007). 899 \n 900 \nFigure 7. Rotating strike-slip arrays acting to produce shortening and along-strike 901 \nelongation (from Hollingsworth et al., 2006), as seen in the Kopeh Dagh. A) Fault 902 \nblocks have initial width d and angle \u03b80 with the deformation zone boundary, across a 903 \nzone of width W0. Grey bands represent fold trends, which act as strain markers as the 904 \nfaults and fault blocks are offset and rotated. B) Offset and fault block rotation 905 \nproduces new boundary length D, and angle \u03b81, across a width W1. C) If all fault 906 \nblock rotations are of the same amount, the geometry simplifies to a single triangle 907 \nwith lengths \u03a3D, \u03a3d and \u03a3s. Measurement of \u03a3D, \u03a3s, \u03b80 and \u03b81 allows the original 908 \nlength of the deforming boundary (\u03a3d) to be calculated using the cosine rule. 909 \n 910 \nFigure 8. Active strike-slip faults in the Central Zagros. Several segmented right-911 \nlateral faults fan out from the southeastern end of the Main Recent Fault. Fault 912 \nlocations derived from Authemayou et al. (2006) and analysis of SRTM imagery. 913 \nFocal mechanisms for thrust and strike-slip events in the region are from the Harvard 914 \nand USGS catalogues (http:\/\/neic.usgs.gov\/neis\/sopar\/) for earthquakes with Mw \u2265 5 915 \nand double-couple component \u2265 70%, in the interval 1986-2005.  916 \n  917 \n13\/05\/2009 \n39 \nFigure 9. Active faulting in the Talesh and western Alborz mountains, illustrating the 918 \nrole of the right-lateral Sangavar Fault as a transfer fault between the regions. Focal 919 \nmechanisms from Jackson et al. (2002), with three additional events from the Harvard 920 \nand USGS catalogues (http:\/\/neic.usgs.gov\/neis\/sopar\/) for earthquakes with Mw \u2265 5 921 \nand double-couple component \u2265 70%, in the interval 2002-2007. Arrows show GPS-922 \nderived velocities with respect to Eurasia, from Masson et al. (2006). These do not 923 \nchange markedly across the region, despite the wide variation in fault strikes and focal 924 \nmechanisms. The inset is a schematic transfer zone between two thrust belts, 925 \nmodelled on the junction of the Talesh and Alborz ranges. Deformation not only 926 \nwraps around the rigid basement of block X, but has to accommodate its motion 927 \nindependent of the north-south convergence of larger regions Y and Z. This produces 928 \nhighly arcuate and complex fault geometries, which are unlikely to be stable over long 929 \nperiods. 930 \nArabia\nEurasia\n1.\n2.\no30  N\no40 o50 o60  Eo30\no40\nMosha\nu\nQ\nchan\nn\nNorth A atolian\nVan\nS\nvan\ne\nrSangava\nNE \nAna\ntoli\nan\nMa n \nec\nt\ni\nR\nen\n \ni\nD\neh\nSh\nr\nK\nh\nn\nas\na\nK\nazerun Sa\ne\nrvs\ntan\nDoru\nneh\nasht eD - -\nBayaz\nAshkabad\nr\nA\nna\nK\nuh B\nanan\nN\nya band\nG\now\nk\nEast\n Ana\ntolia\nn\nCent\nral \ntolia\nn\nAna\n Dead Sea \ntFaul  System\nEskisehir\nalan a\nS\nd\nN\neh\nh\nd\nZa\ne\nanS\nbzevaran\na\nh\nAsta\nne\nG e te  u asu\nr a r Ca c s\nuran\nT\nTurkish-Iranian plateauZa\nros\ng\nersi n G\nl\nP\na\nu f\nIndes\nSouth \nCaspian \nBasin\nTalesh\nMt Lebanon\nDead Sea \npull-apart\nAlborz\nDasht-e\nLut\nKopeh \nDagh\nf\nA\nghanistanArabia\nEurasia\nakranM\nypriot arC c\n3.\nHellenic \narc\nRed \nSea\nBlack\nSea \nMediterranean\nAnatolia Ece-\nmi\u015f\nLesser Ca\nu\nu\nsas\nc\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt t\nt\nt t\nY\nZ\nX\n4.\n2\n2\n3\n4\n5\n1\n1\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nY N\nX\nX\nY\nA)\nB)\n5.\ne\ne\nX r\nlativ\n to \nY\nr\nat\nt\nY\nX\n e\nl\niv\ne \no \no54  Eo35\no37  N\no52\nAs\nnehta\nt\nt\nt\nt\nTehran\nKhazar\nMosha\nTaleghan D\na gha\nnm\nuzFir\nkuh\n100 km\n6.\nSD\nSs\nSd\nA)\nB)\nC)\n7.\nShiraz\nK\nn\nazeru\nArdakan\nK\nreh Bas\na\nSabz \nhan\nPus\naM in Recent\nD\n \nhir\neh\nS\nSarvestan\n8.\nen\naZ\no\ng\nor\nZ\ns\n \n S\nd\nim\ne\np\ndlo\nl  Fe\no38  N\no37  \n100 km\n10 mm\/yr\neTal sh\nAlb rzo\nS\nng\na\nar\n F\n.\na\nv\nudbar F.R\nr  F\nN.
