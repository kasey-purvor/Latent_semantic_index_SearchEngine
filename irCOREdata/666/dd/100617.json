INTRODUCTION\nThe presence of ambient gas can have a dramatic effect\non the expansion dynamics of laser ablated plasmas,1 which\nin turn can affect the nature of the species present in the\nplume. Pulsed laser ablation2 \u0001PLA\u0002 of graphite results in the\ndeposition of quite different carbonaceous structures depend-\ning on the pressure of ambient gas in the chamber.3,4 In\nvacuum, PLA of graphite is typically used to produce\nsmooth, hard, high density amorphous carbon \u0001a-C\u0002 films\nwith a high sp3 bonded C content \u0001up to 90%\u0002.5,6 The high\nsp3 content has been attributed to local densification,\ncaused by the impact of high energy C atoms\/ions. This\nsubplantation model, has been shown to provide a suitable\nrepresentation of the growth mechanism for a-C films\ngrown by a variety of techniques.7 The introduction of a low\npressure of inert gas into the growth chamber reduces the\nkinetic energy of the growth species due to the increased\ncollision frequency. In this regime, plume splitting into fast\n\u0001\u0003vacuum speed\u0002 and collision retarded components has\nbeen observed.1,8 At higher pressures plume confinement,\nand plume heating occurs, which leads to enhanced emission\nfrom the plume core and enhanced excitation\/ionization at\nthe plume front. High collision rates encourage conversion of\nthe plume stream velocity into thermal energy. Compared\nwith growth in vacuum, these conditions have been shown to\nyield lower density nanostructured amorphous carbon \u0001NAC\u0002\nfilms,4,9 which can exhibit a range of useful properties in-\ncluding low thresholds for electron field emission10 and high\nporosities.4 Recent work on high-repetion-rate laser ablation\nof graphite in high background pressures of argon has shown\nthat these conditions are suitable for the deposition of carbon\nnanofoam.11 This cluster assembled filamentary material has\nbeen shown to demonstrate ferromagnetic behavior12 sug-\ngesting possible applications in spintronic devices.\nTraditionally, PLA has been performed using lasers giving\nnanosecond \u0001ns\u0002 duration pulses. However, the advent of\nsubpicosecond \u0004typically, and henceforth called femtosecond\n\u0001fs\u0002\u0005 pulsed lasers opened the possibility of decoupling the\ninitial photoexcitation of the target material from the subse-\nquent dynamics of the removed atomic, ionic, and molecular\nplume components. This decoupling removes a layer of com-\nplexity from the ablation process, thereby facilitating the in-\nvestigation and understanding of PLA mechanisms. Ul-\ntrashort pulsed lasers offer dramatically higher peak-powers\nthan ns lasers and hence, the ablation mechanisms can be\nsignificantly different. Two different models are often pro-\nposed to describe the ablation by these ultrashort pulses. In\nthe plasma-annealing model, the rapid rise in the number of\nelectrons in excited states at the irradiated zone can produce\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 72, 205413 \u00012005\u0002\n1098-0121\/2005\/72\u000120\u0002\/205413\u000113\u0002\/$23.00 \u00a92005 The American Physical Society205413-1\nbond softening by Coulomb repulsion allowing ultrafast\nmelting. In this regime the plume of ablated material can\ncontain ions ejected with \u201csuprathermal\u201d energies13\u201315 \u0001i.e.,\nemitted at velocities too large to be accounted for by thermal\nevaporation\u0002. In the two temperature model,16 the tempera-\nture of the electrons is treated separately to that of the lattice,\nthe laser energy coupling only to the electrons. Thus, the\nlaser essentially produces an immediate rise in the electron\ntemperature. Hot electrons then transfer energy to the lattice\n\u0001typically on a ps timescale, depending on the electron-\nphonon coupling strength\u0002. The ablation is thus pictured as\nfast thermal evaporation.\nIn this paper we compare the dynamics of the ablation\nplume, during the 248 nm pulsed laser ablation of graphite,\nfor pulses of ns and fs duration. The ablation is performed in\nbackground pressures of argon and helium \u0001PAr and PHe\u0002. We\ninvestigate how the background pressure affects the kinetic\nenergies of species in the ablation plume by using time-gated\nimaging methods17 to monitor the temporal and spatial evo-\nlution of the accompanying optical emission as a function of\nPAr. Particular attention is focussed on emission from elec-\ntronically excited C+ ions \u0001henceforth C+*\u0002, which are con-\nsidered to arise both from C2+ ion\/electron recombination\nprocesses in the early stages of plume expansion and, at el-\nevated background pressures, from collision induced impact\nionization\/excitation of C. The apparent velocities of these\nemitting species are estimated, and correlations between\nthese velocities and the structure of the resulting films ex-\nplored.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nThe ablation plume imaging apparatus consists of a stain-\nless steel vacuum chamber which was evacuated using a tur-\nbomolecular pump, backed by a rotary pump to a base pres-\nsure of 10\u22126 Torr. The chamber was equipped with several\nside arms, each of which was sealed with a quartz window,\npermitting wide spectral-range optical observation of the\nplume produced during ablation. The incident laser beam\npropagated through one of the side arms, in the xy plane at\n45\u00b0 to the target surface normal\u2014here defined as the x axis.\nThe viewing port lay in the xy plane also and allowed optical\nemission accompanying the ablation plume to be monitored\nby viewing along the y axis \u0001i.e., parallel to the target sur-\nface\u0002. The highly oriented pyrolytic graphite target \u0001Kurt J.\nLesker, 99.99 % pure\u0002, was rotated during the experiments in\norder to avoid repeated ablation of the same spot on the\ntarget. Femtosecond 248 nm laser pulses were generated us-\ning a XeCl excimer pumped dye laser system producing 450\nfs pulses from a distributed feedback dye laser at 496 nm\nwhich, after frequency doubling, were amplified in the KrF\nexcimer laser cavity.18,19 The KrF cavity \u0001Lambda-Physik\nEMG150MSC\u0002, operating unseeded, provided pulses of 15\nns full width at half maximum \u0001FWHM\u0002 at 248 nm. The\noutputs of the nanosecond excimer laser and the frequency\ndoubled dye laser had markedly different spatial profiles,\nbeam divergences, and peak powers, which meant that\nthese two sources produced very different spot sizes when\nfocused at the target. Typical laser pulse energies \u0001and flu-\nences\u0002 employed in the experiments described here were\n\u0003110 mJ\/pulse\u00016 J \/cm2\u0002 in the case of ns ablation and\n\u000313 mJ\/pulse\u00016 J \/cm2\u0002 for the fs studies. Although the flu-\nences used were similar, the power density was nearly 5\norders of magnitude lower for the ns, as compared with the\nfs, pulses.\nThe plume emission was collected in two different ways.\nSpatially resolved, wavelength dispersed spectra were re-\ncorded by focusing \u0001in a 1:1 magnification configuration\u0002 the\nemission onto a quartz fiber, directed so as to view a local-\nized column along the y axis. The exit of the fiber abutted the\nentrance slit \u0001width set at 30 \u0002m\u0002 of a 0.32 m spectrograph\n\u0001TRIAX-320, Jobin Yvon\/Spex\u0002 equipped with three, user\nselectable, holographic gratings, with 600, 1800, and\n2400 lines\/mm, providing spectral resolutions of 0.4, 0.15,\nand 0.1 nm, respectively. The resulting dispersed emission\nspectrum was recorded with an intensified charge coupled\ndevice \u0001i-CCD DH520-18F, Andor Technology\u0002, the sensitiv-\nity of which spanned the wavelength range 350\u2013900 nm. The\nspectra were collected using a gate time of 1 \u0002s, which\nopened 120 ns after the laser pulse. This delay time was the\nminimum response time of the electronics used. By translat-\ning the position of the entrance of the fiber, the x dependence\nof the optical emission spectrum could be measured, with a\nspatial resolution of \u00030.6 mm. A second means of investi-\ngating the plume emission involved imaging the evolving\nspatial distributions of selected emitting species using the\ni-CCD camera in time-gated detection mode, decoupling it\nfrom the spectrometer and focusing the optical emission \u0001ei-\nther total emission, or just the fraction transmitted through a\nsuitably chosen narrow bandpass interference filter\u0002 onto the\n1024\u0003256 diode array. The spatial calibration of the i-CCD\nimage was achieved by taking an image of a ruler positioned\nin the xz plane and illuminated by a white light source. The\nminimum time delay at which an i-CCD image of the plume\ncould be taken was limited to t=120 ns by the response time\nof the available electronics. Optical emission spectra and\nwavelength filtered plume images were obtained for PAr val-\nues in the range 0\u2013340 mTorr and at PHe=340 mTorr to 4\nTorr.\nFilms were deposited by ns PLA, of the same graphite\ntarget, in a separate ablation chamber using a Lambda-\nPhysik LPX 210i excimer laser operating at 248 nm, with a\npulse duration of 25 ns. The 60 mJ laser pulse was focused\nonto the rotating target, producing an incident fluence of\n\u00036 J \/cm2. Here the same fluence was used for the ns depo-\nsition and plume analysis experiments. However, as the laser\nspot sizes were different, there is likely to be slightly differ-\nent angular distributions of material for the two deposition\nsystems. Thus, to allow fair comparison, optical emission\nspectroscopy, microscopic analysis of deposits, and velocity\nanalysis of the plume expansion were performed only along\nthe target surface normal to minimize any discrepancy. The\ngrowth chamber was evacuated using a turbo molecular\npump to 9\u000310\u22128 Torr, then back-filled with argon to the\nrequired pressure. The material ejected during fs PLA was\ncollected in the same vacuum chamber used for the imaging\nstudies, concurrent with the plume dynamics experiments. A\nlarger number of laser shots was required for fs pulses, to\nproduce a similar film thickness as for ns ablation, as it ap-\nHENLEY et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW B 72, 205413 \u00012005\u0002\n205413-2\npeared that less material is ablated per shot. For both growth\nsetups, films were deposited onto Si substrates at various PAr\nranging from 5 to 500 mTorr. The target to substrate distance\nwas fixed at 6 cm. The deposition rate was found to be PAr\ndependent, and the number of laser shots was thus varied \u0001in\nthe range 2000\u201310 000\u0002 in order that the final film thickness\nwas within a fixed range. The surface morphology of the\nfilms was investigated in a Hitachi S4000 field emission gun\nscanning electron microscope \u0001SEM\u0002 operating at 20 kV. The\nnanostructure of the films was investigated using a Philips\nCM200 high-resolution transmission electron microscope\n\u0001TEM\u0002. Laser Raman spectroscopy \u0001Renishaw Ramanscope,\n514.5 nm excitation\u0002 was used to investigate the structure\nand bonding configurations in the films.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. Analysis of deposited material\nFor ns pulses, the surface morphology of the deposited\nmaterial was examined by SEM. Figure 1 shows SEM im-\nages of a range of samples deposited at different PAr. We find\nthat films deposited at the lowest PAr used \u00015 mTorr\u0002 are\nessentially indistinguishable from tetrahedral amorphous car-\nbon \u0001ta-C\u0002 films grown in vacuum, being hard, scratch resis-\ntant and having a \u201cmirror\u201d smooth morphology \u0004see Fig.\n1\u0001a\u0002\u0005. Increasing PAr to 40 mTorr \u0004Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002\u0005 yielded films\nthat are much rougher. The SEM images reveal nanoscale\nroughness, with an estimated scale of d\u000315\u00b13 nm. Larger\nthickness fluctuations \u0001d\u000345 nm\u0002 are clearly evident when\nPAr was raised further, to 100 mTorr. These deposits could be\neasily scratched off with a pair of tweezers, consistent with\nthe expected reduction in film hardness. Films grown at\nPAr=340 mTorr exhibited yet another morphology, wherein\nthe nanoscale roughness was replaced by more filamentary\ngrowth, similar to the carbon nano-foam deposited by Rode\net al.11 These films, which could be removed simply by rub-\nbing the surface, were deduced to have the lowest hardness\nand density of all of the a-C films grown in the present work.\nA high-resolution TEM image of this filamentary material is\nshown in Fig. 2. The nanostructure is seen to consist of\nnanoscale clusters with diameters of \u000310 nm. These clusters\nare assembled in a fractal-like arrangement suggesting that\nthe growth mechanism is characterized by diffusion limited\naggregation.20\nFigures 1\u0001e\u0002 and 1\u0001f\u0002 show SEM images of the material\ndeposited by fs pulses at PAr=340 and 500 mTorr, respec-\ntively. Nanoscale roughness is observed again, but the films\nappear smoother than those deposited at the same pressure\nusing ns pulses. Even at the highest pressure, 500 mTorr,\nthere was no evidence of the deposition of carbon-nanofoam-\nlike material found for ns ablation. These observations are\ndiscussed in more detail later. As the fs-ablated material evi-\ndenced nanostructures comparable to material deposited by\nns pulses at lower pressures, the fs plume dynamics studies\npresented later will concentrate mainly on higher pressures.\nAs two different chambers were used during the deposition\nexperiments, one possible source of error here is the accura-\ncies of the two pressure gauges used. The ns and fs plume\ndynamics experiments, presented later, were all performed in\nthe same chamber and thus will be internally consistent. For\nthe ns growth chamber, however, no direct comparison was\npossible with the set pressure during the fs depositions.\nHowever, comparable nanostructures between the fs and ns\ndeposits were only observed for a factor of 5 difference in\npressure \u0004compare Figs. 1\u0001c\u0002 and 1\u0001f\u0002\u0005, which should be sig-\nnificantly outside the bounds of experimental uncertainty.\nThe density and bonding configuration of a-C films\nproduced by PLA are determined primarily by the kinetic\nFIG. 1.

It was thus logical to investigate\nhow changing PAr affected the bonding in the as-deposited\nfilms. The Raman spectrum for each of the samples depos-\nited, by ns ablation, was measured using 514.5 nm excita-\ntion. These results are presented elsewhere,22 but we present\na summary here: Visible Raman spectra of a-C films are\ntraditionally characterized as a combination of two bands,\nlabeled the D and G peaks and attributed to the breathing\nmode of aromatic rings and in-plane bond stretching of pairs\nof sp2 bonded C atoms, respectively.23\u201325 For 514.5 nm ex-\ncitation the D and G peaks are typically centered at\n\u00031335 cm\u22121 and in the range 1580\u00b120 cm\u22121, respectively.\nFor films deposited at low PAr \u0001below \u000315 mTorr\u0002 we find\nthat the complete Raman line shape can be fitted24 without\nany D peak contribution. This is characteristic of so-called\ntetrahedral amorphous carbon \u0001ta-C\u0002 films, for which the ra-\ntio of the D and G peak intensities \u0001ID\/ IG\u0002 tends towards\nzero as the fraction of sp3 bonded C increases, and implies\nthat the present films grown at PAr less than \u000315 mTorr\ncontain few if any six-membered sp2 clusters.\nFitting the Raman line shapes of films deposited at higher\nPAr required inclusion of progressively larger D peak contri-\nbutions, implying an increase in ordering of the sp2 phase\ndue to the formation of larger clusters of aromatic rings.24\nThis increase in \u0001ID\/ IG\u0002 ratio also suggests an increase in the\nfraction of sp2 bonded C in the films.22 These observations\nare similar to those of Siegal et al.4 who found little change\nin the Raman spectra of NAC films grown by PLA as PAr\nwas increased through the range 175\u2013300 mTorr. We also\nnote that, though the density of these films is low, their Ra-\nman spectra are similar to those of high density amorphous\ncarbon \u0001a-C\u0002, unlike the films deposited by cluster\nassembly.26\nB. Wavelength dispersed optical emission spectroscopy\nIn order to explore the effect of background pressures of\ninert gas and the pulse duration on the film structure further,\nthe dynamics of the plume of ablated material was studied by\nmonitoring the temporal and spatial evolution of its optical\nemission. Initially wavelength dispersed optical emission\nspectra \u0001OES\u0002 were measured at different PAr, close to the\nablation volume \u0001x\u00030\u0002 and at x\u00035 mm. Figure 3 shows\nsuch spectra, recorded in vacuum and at PAr=154 mTorr, for\nablation with ns pulses. The spectra exhibit numerous sharp\nlines all of which are attributable to emission from electroni-\ncally excited C+* ions and C* and excited Ar ions and neu-\ntrals, as well as the characteristic Swan bands associated with\nexcited C2\u0001d\u0002 radicals. A detailed list of these lines, assigning\nthe emitter and emitting transition, is presented by Claeys-\nsens et al.17 The relative intensities, however, of these vari-\nous emissions varies markedly between the spectra. C2\n* emis-\nsion is evident in the immediate ablation zone at all PAr, but\nonly at higher PAr does it persist to larger x, suggesting a role\nfor collision induced formation of, and\/or excitation to, C2\n*\n.\nWe note that, even under vacuum, C2\n* emission makes a far\ngreater relative contribution to the total OES than in the case\nof PLA of graphite at 193 nm.27 The C+* and C* emissions\nare associated with transitions between excited states of the\nrespective species. Radiation trapping is thus unlikely to be\nan issue, and the observed persistence of such emissions\nfrom plumes arising in PLA processes, in vacuum \u0001over ti-\nmescales that correspond to many natural radiative lifetimes\u0002\nhas been rationalized in terms of electron-ion recombination\n\u0001EIR\u0002, leading to formation of highly excited \u0001Rydberg\u0002 at-\noms and subsequent radiative cascade.27 Such a sequence,\nfinally observed in the optical emission as a peak at 426.7\nnm, follows:\nC2+ + e\u2192 C+**\u0001high n,l,m\u0002\u2192 \u2192 \u2192 C+*\u00014f\u0002\u2192 C+*\u00013d\u0002 .\n\u00011\u0002\nIn the case of ns and fs PLA in vacuum, therefore, C+* emis-\nsion is regarded as a signature of C2+ species, etc. In the\npresent work, both C+*, Ar* and Ar+* emissions are seen to\ngain in relative intensity as PAr and x increase \u0001see Fig. 3\u0002.\nThe latter emissions, in particular, provide clear indications\nof the involvement of one or more collision induced, post-\nablation excitation routes.\nAfter examining the ablation with ns pulses, we turn our\nattention to the OES produced by pulses of fs duration.\nFigure 4 shows such spectra, recorded in vacuum and at\nPAr=154 mTorr, for ablation with fs pulses. Again, two\nspectra are shown for each pressure, one taken from close to\nthe ablation volume \u0001x\u00030\u0002 \u0004Figs. 4\u0001a\u0002 and 4\u0001c\u0002\u0005 and one at\nx\u00035 mm \u0004Figs. 4\u0001b\u0002 and 4\u0001d\u0002\u0005 along the target surface nor-\nmal. By comparing the spectra in Figs. 3 and 4, we observe\nthat, for ablation in vacuum, the OES spectra at the ablation\nvolume are very similar for fs and ns pulses. Both spectra are\ndominated by the C2\n* Swan band emission. This dominance\nof C2\n* emission could be a consequence of the detection\nmethod. The minimum delay time after the laser pulse that\ncould be used for the start of the detection gate, was 120 ns.\nIt is likely that even after this delay a significant fraction of\nFIG. 3.

This will be discussed in\nmore detail later.\nThe C2\n* emission is localized at the spot for fs ablation in\nvacuum and, similar to ns ablation, only extends further\naway from the target at elevated background pressures. Simi-\nlar observations have been made for the ablation of graphite\nin N2.28 At 5 mm from the target, for ablation in vacuum, the\nmost intense emission comes from the C+ ions for fs abla-\ntion, instead of from excited C atoms as was the case for ns\nablation. This is consistent with the observation of an en-\nhanced degree of plume ionization for ultrashort pulsed ab-\nlation when compared with using nanosecond pulses,17,29 al-\nthough no information can be obtained on the distribution of\nground state material using optical emission measurements.\nFor the fs ablation at elevated pressures we observe that the\nenhancement, compared to ablation in vacuum, of the C+*\nemission is not as large as for ns pulses. The spectrum\nat x=5 mm is still dominated by the C2* emission, which also\nincreases in intensity slightly compared to the signal at\nx=0 mm. This either indicates an increased production of C2\nfragments during the initial ablation, compared with ns pulse\nablation, or more collision induced formation30 of, and\/or\nexcitation to, C2\n*\n. Simulations of the fs ablation of graphite14\nhave shown that ultrafast pulses produce significant carbon\nchains and clusters in addition to fast monomers, so it is\nlikely that the enhanced C2\n* signal for fs pulses indicates an\nincreased production of C clusters by fs pulses. Another fac-\ntor affecting the relative numbers of C clusters in the plumes,\nproduced by ns and fs pulses, is the interaction of the laser\nwith the ablation plume. For fs pulses the laser pulse has\nended before the plume has formed, so no interaction is pos-\nsible. For ns pulses however, the laser can interact with the\nablated species. As the laser photon energy is large enough to\nbreak C\u2013C bonds, photodissociation of molecular Cn species\nis possible. This effect is expected to be enhanced for abla-\ntion at 193 nm, and indeed, Claeyssens et al. observed no\nemission from C2\n* for ablation at this wavelength.27\nIn addition to ablation in Ar, OES spectra were measured\nfor the fs ablation of graphite in background pressures of He.\nFigure 5 shows spatially resolved OES spectra of the plume,\nfor fs ablation in 340 mTorr of He, measured at x\u00030 mm\nand x\u00035 mm from the target. At the ablation spot the spec-\ntrum is again dominated by the C2\n* emission . Away from the\nablation spot, the emission from the C2\n* Swan band system\ndoes not retain its intensity as was observed for ablation at\nlower pressures of Ar, and only one line attributable to He* is\nobserved. This is likely due to the smaller size, and hence\nsmaller collisional cross section, of He atoms compared to\nAr. Thus, a much higher pressure of He will be required to\ncause significant impact excitation of the ablated species. We\nwill return to discuss possible collisional excitation and im-\npact ionization schemes \u0001for both C+* and C2\n*\u0002 later. Also\nvisible in the spectra taken at x=0 mm is a broad emission\nband in the range 360\u2013450 nm, which has been attributed to\nemission from C3\n* radicals.31 This emission band is also ob-\nserved at the focal spot for the fs ablation in vacuum and Ar\n\u0001see Fig. 4\u0002, perhaps indicating again that more small clusters\nare ablated for fs pulses, compared with ns ablation.\nBefore considering the additional insights provided by\ntime-gated imaging measurements, we summarize the con-\nclusions drawn from the OES produced by ns and fs pulses at\n248 nm.\n\u0001i\u0002 fs pulses, incident on a graphite target in vacuum, di-\nrectly ablate a larger fraction of material in highly excited,\nionized states.

Time resolved imaging of plume emissions from specific\nspecies\nFigure 6 shows a series of time-gated CCD images of\nemission from the ns ablation plume for different values of\nPAr. Images \u0001a\u0002\u2013\u0001f\u0002 are for PLA in vacuum, while \u0001g\u0002\u2013\u0001i\u0002\nwere recorded at PAr=20 mTorr, and \u0001j\u0002\u2013\u0001l\u0002 at 154 mTorr.\nImages \u0001a\u0002\u2013\u0001c\u0002 are of the total detectable emission, whereas\nall of the other images were recorded while viewing through\na 426 nm narrow band pass filter chosen so as to transmit the\nC+* \u00014f;2F\u00b0\u21923d ; 2D\u000232 transition at 426.7 nm. This is the\nmost intense of all of the lines evident in Fig. 3\u0001d\u0002. We rec-\nognize that this filter will also transmit emission from the\nweak Ar II line at 427.7 nm, but this is not a major contribu-\ntor to the emission spectra. All images were recorded using a\n20 ns time gate on the intensifier, but with different time\ndelays after the laser pulse: t=120 ns for images in the first\ncolumn, 250 ns \u0001second column\u0002, and 400 ns \u0001third column\u0002.\nThe white arrow in \u0001a\u0002 indicates the axis of laser irradiation.\nEach image has been averaged over multiple laser shots and\nscaled to allow use of the entire grey-scale range. By aver-\naging over multiple shots very reproducible plume shapes\ncould be obtained, reducing the effect of any shot-to-shot\nvariation.\nComparing the images in the first and second rows of Fig.\n6, we see that the distribution of the total OES signal accom-\npanying 248 nm PLA of graphite in vacuum is similar to that\nof the C+* emission, though the unfiltered distribution ap-\npears somewhat broader \u0001presumably because it is sampling\na variety of species which need not all have the same veloc-\nity distributions\u0002. Clearly, the distribution of the C+* emis-\nsion is changed by the presence of background Ar. The peak\nin the C+* emission images recorded at PAr=20 mTorr of\nargon is retarded relative to the corresponding images in\nvacuum \u0004see Figs. 6\u0001g\u0002\u20136\u0001i\u0002\u0005. There are also hints of bimo-\ndality in the distribution along the x axis, with a faster front\ncomponent and a slower curved rear component \u0004see, for\nexample, Fig. 6\u0001h\u0002\u0005. These trends become ever more pro-\nnounced with increasing PAr \u0004Figs. 6\u0001j\u0002\u20136\u0001l\u0002\u0005. The distribu-\ntion of C+* emission appears as an arc, more characteristic of\nshock wave propagation.33 Thus, the peak in the spatial dis-\ntribution of C+* ions at high PAr is likely to be near the\nposition of highest plume density and thus highest collisional\nexcitation\/ionization probability. In this case the majority of\nthe C+* is expected to come from impact ionised C atoms\nrather than from EIR of C2+. Also the peak of the early time\ndistribution actually appears more advanced than in the cor-\nresponding PAr=20 mTorr image. At longer delays after the\nlaser pulses than presented here, the emission intensity from\nthe shock front decays away and the spatial distribution\nalong the x-axis broadens as the shock front dissipates into\nthe background gas.\nIn addition to monitoring the plume emissions for ns\npulses, the plume dynamics during fs ablation were also in-\nvestigated. Figure 7 shows a series of time-gated CCD im-\nages of emission from the fs ablation plume of graphite in\ndifferent values of PAr. All the images in this figure were\ntaken using the filter that passes the C+* emission at 426.7\nFIG. 6.

Figures 7\u0001a\u0002\u20137\u0001c\u0002 are for fs ablation in vacuum and are\ntaken at delays of 120, 180, and 300 ns after the laser pulse,\nrespectively. Similar to ablation with ns pulses, the C+* emis-\nsion in vacuum appears as a broad distribution moving rap-\nidly away from the ablation spot. When a background pres-\nsure of Ar is introduced the plume dynamics are again\ndramatically affected. Figures 7\u0001d\u0002\u20137\u0001f\u0002 show images ob-\ntained at PAr=154 mTorr for delays of 120, 420, and 900 ns\nafter the laser pulse. Initially \u0004Fig. 7\u0001d\u0002\u0005, the formation of a\npropagating shock wave is observed, similar to that observed\nwith ns pulses. However, the shock wave is more confined\nalong the x axis and is more \u201carrow head\u201d shaped, rather\nthan presenting a smooth arc. Such \u201carrow head\u201d shaped\nshock fronts are often observed for projectiles, such as bul-\nlets, traveling at supersonic velocities in air. This last obser-\nvation suggests that the angular divergence of the ablated\nmaterial is smaller for fs ablation when compared to ns\npulses. Such a tightly forward-pointing distribution of\nejected material is often observed for ablation with fs\npulses.34 At later times the appearance of the C+* emission\ndistribution deviates from that observed with ns pulses. At\nt=420 ns \u0004Fig. 7\u0001e\u0002\u0005 two regions of emission are observed,\noriented along the x axis, at the sides of the plume. This\nobservation could be explained by the formation of a region\nof lower pressure behind the shock front. Only at the edges\nof this region would material ejected at later times \u0001or with\nslower initial velocities\u0002 come into contact with the back-\nground gas. The emission images are projections into 2D of\nthe emission at the edges of an expanding region, thus the\nintensity received is greatest when viewing along a tangent\nto this region. By 900 ns, the distribution changes to two arcs\nof emission \u0004see Fig. 7\u0001f\u0002\u0005 both propagating forward, the arc\ncloser to the target being broader than the more advanced\none. This double shock wave may be evidence for the exis-\ntence of \u0001at least\u0002 two components in the fs ablation plume\nwith very different velocity distributions. This conclusion is\nsupported by recent measurements of the plume dynamics, in\nvacuum, after fs infrared ablation of graphite, where plumes\nwith multi-component velocity structures were also\nobserved.35,36 It is suggested that the first component is as-\nsociated with an initial burst of highly energetic\/electrically\nexcited ablated components, indicative of the enhanced frac-\ntion of nonthermal ejection mechanisms compared to ns ab-\nlation, and the second with subsequently ejected, slower\nmoving, material which could consist of thermally ejected C\natoms and clusters. We suggest that the second wave forms\nas the material ejected more slowly collides with the back of\nthe dissipating first shock wave. There is no evidence for this\nsecond shock wave being a backwards propagating reflected\nwave, as its x position increases slowly with time. For fs\nablation at a higher PAr of 340 mTorr \u0004see Figs. 7\u0001g\u0002\u20137\u0001i\u0002\u0005,\nthe initial shock wave is further retarded compared to that\nformed at PAr=154 mTorr and dissipates more quickly, such\nthat by t=900 ns only the second compression wave is vis-\nible.\nA schematic diagram following the evolution of the C+*\nemission distribution from the plume is shown in Fig. 8. The\nscheme shows a cross section though the plume. In this ex-\nplanation, the existence of a prompt and a delayed source of\nejected material is postulated. The first source, with angular\ndistribution of \u00041, producing a tightly confined shock front\n\u0004Fig. 8\u0001a\u0002\u0005. Following this initial burst of ablated material is\na slower component, with angular distribution of \u00042 \u0004see Fig.\n8\u0001b\u0002\u0005. Impact ionization of this component by collisions with\nthe gas atoms at the side of the plume produces emission.\nLater in the evolution \u0004see Fig. 8\u0001c\u0002\u0005, the emission from the\nfront shock wave starts to dissipate. The regions of emission\nat the sides of the plume appear to start to move in behind\nthe shock front. Lastly, in this sequence \u0004Fig. 8\u0001d\u0002\u0005 the opti-\ncal emission from the first shock wave has almost gone and\nthe profile is dominated by emission from the material col-\nliding with the high pressure region at the rear of the first\nshock front.\nAfter examining the evolution of the C+* emission, we\nnow discuss the dynamics of the C2\n* radical emission for fs\nablation. This was achieved by passing the plume emission\nthrough an interference filter with its pass band centered at\n525 nm with a full width at half-maximum of 10 nm. This\nfilter will primarily transmit the emission from C2\n* radicals in\ntheir d3\u0005u state \u0001and most noticeably, the origin of the d-a\nSwan band system at 516.5 nm\u0002. There will also be very\nslight contamination from the C+* transition at 514.6 nm.\nFigure 9 shows a series of time-gated CCD images of emis-\nsion from the fs ablation plume of graphite at different values\nof PAr. Figures 9\u0001a\u0002\u20139\u0001c\u0002 are for ablation in vacuum and are\ntaken at delays of 120, 420, and 900 ns after the laser pulse,\nrespectively. The peak in the C2\n* emission is observed to re-\nmain located at the target, as was observed here in the spa-\ntially resolved OES measurements and elsewhere.17 Lifetime\narguments exclude radiative cascade as a mechanism for the\npersistence of the C2\n* emission, so another source of C2\n* is\nrequired.

A schematic diagram following the evolution of the C+*\nemission distribution from the plume. The scheme shows a cross\nsection through the plume. In this explanation, the existence of two\ntemporally separated sources is postulated.

Three body collisions are a likely source here as, for\nablation in vacuum, collisional processes will occur pre-\ndominately at the high pressure region near the target. Mon-\nchicourt also concludes that binary collisions of C atoms in\nexcited states would not lead to C2\n* production as the internal\nenergy of the initial system would be too large to form a\nstable molecule.\nFor 1.06 \u0002m Nd:YAG PLA of graphite in He, Sasaki\net al.30 monitored the spatial distribution of C2 and C3 radi-\ncals by laser induced fluorescence. They concluded that the\nnumber of C2 radicals produced by gas phase reactions was\ncomparable with the direct ablation from the target. Here, we\nexpect to have contributions to the C2\n* emission from both\ncollisional excitation of C2 and from direct formation of C2\n*\nby binary collisions of C atoms and three-body interactions\nbetween C atoms and inert gas atoms.\nFigures 9\u0001d\u0002\u20139\u0001f\u0002 show images obtained at PAr\n=154 mTorr for the same delays after the laser pulse as for\nablation in vacuum. At t=120 ns \u0004Fig. 9\u0001d\u0002\u0005 the emission is\nstill mainly located at the target. However, in addition, a\nweak emission is observed from the same region as the\nshock wave seen in the C+* filtered images. This is either due\nto contamination of the signal by the C+* emission, or pro-\nduction of\/excitation to C2\n* by collisions, or a combination of\nboth effects. At t=420 ns \u0004Fig. 9\u0001e\u0002\u0005 the emission from the\nshock front has reduced in intensity dramatically and the\npeak in the emission is observed at the edges of the region\nthrough which the shock wave has propagated. This again\nsuggests that this central region is at a relatively low pres-\nsure, the collisions forming the C2\n* only occurring at the\nboundaries. As the initial shock wave observed in the C+*\nemission dissipates, the C2\n* emission distribution takes the\nform of second arc-shaped shock wave that propagates\nslowly away from the target. This second shock wave is in\nthe same position as that observed in the C+* filtered images.\nAgain, we propose that this second wave of emission occurs\nas material ejected later, and\/or with a slower velocity, col-\nlides with the material at the rear of the dissipating first\nshock wave. The higher intensity of the emissions from the\nside of the plume, compared with that at the shock front\n\u0001which is still visible in the C+* filtered images\u0002, indicates\nthat collisional excitation of slowly ejected C2 may be the\ndominant source of the C2\n* emission.\nAs previously,27 estimates of the apparent mean velocities\n\u0006v\u0007 of the imaged species, for both ns and fs ablation, were\nderived by analyzing the emission intensity profiles along the\nx axis of each image. Figure 10\u0001a\u0002 shows several such pro-\nfiles, for ns ablation, and their variation with PAr, for data\nrecorded at t=300 ns. These plots illustrate the bimodal na-\nture of the emission distribution at low and intermediate PAr\nvalues \u0001an observation that will be discussed more fully later,\nand appears more dramatically, when the ablation in He is\ninvestigated\u0002. Forward peaking of the distributions measured\nat high PAr is also evident. A similar set of profiles for the\nablation using fs pulses, also measured t=300 ns after the\nlaser pulse, are shown in Fig. 10\u0001b\u0002. In vacuum, the profile\nfor fs pulses is similar to that for ns ablation, but the distri-\nbution is broader and further advanced. At the higher values\nof PAr, the profiles across the shock wave, for fs pulses, are\nmuch narrower and more retarded when compared to ns ab-\nlation. The plume confinement appears more significant for\nthe initial shock wave formed by fs ablation. This suggests\nthat the high energy impacting species forming the initial\nshock wave are emitted over a shorter period of time than for\nfs pulses.\nThe peak \u0001or peaks\u0002 and the center of gravity of each\ndistribution were found by fitting with suitable mathematical\nfunctions, the exact nature of which varied, to allow system-\natic fitting of the plume evolution.

Figures 11 illustrates the good\nlinear relationship between xpeak and time t observed for\n248 nm PLA of graphite, in vacuum. The gradient of this plot\ngives a propagation velocity \u0006v\u0007 of 41.5\u00b10.1 km\/s for the\nC2+ species \u0001remembering that we asserted earlier that in\nvacuum the C+* emission comes from EIR of C2+\u0002. This is\nequivalent to a C atom kinetic energy of \u0003107 eV, and is in\nexcellent accord with values obtained previously for such\nspecies formed in the PLA of graphite in vacuum, using\nnanosecond 193 nm and 248 nm laser pulses and comparable\nincident fluences.17,27 a-C films grown from ablation plumes\ncontaining C cations with energies in this range typically\ntend to have a high \u0001\u000380% \u0002 fraction of sp3 bonding.21\nAs stated earlier, the filtered images of the evolving plume\nin 20 mTorr of argon show a bimodal velocity distribution.\nThis bimodality has the effect of making all xpeak versus\nt plots obtained at PAr\u00060 nonlinear, with a curvature that\nincreases with PAr. This curvature is not noticeable at\nPAr=20 mTorr and the \u0006v\u0007 extracted is 36.0\u00b10.4 km\/s. Such\nbimodality, or plume splitting, has been reported previously\nboth for ions and neutral species formed by PLA in low\npressures of background gas.1,8,37 In the present case, the\nobserved bimodal distribution most probably reflects contri-\nbutions to the observed C+* emission both from EIR involv-\ning C2+ ions \u0001as for PLA in vacuum\u0002 and from collision\ninduced impact ionization.\nCollisional contributions would be expected to increase,\nand the apparent propagation velocity to slow, with increas-\ning PAr. Consistent with such expectations, we see that for\nPAr=68 mTorr \u0004see Fig. 11\u0001a\u0002, iii\u0005, the relationship between\nxpeak and t has a marked negative curvature: the extracted\nvelocity \u0001obtained from tangents to the curve\u0002 reduces from\n33\u00b11.1 km\/s at t=120 ns to 8.2\u00b10.4 km\/s at 400 ns. Such\neffects are even more marked for the data recorded at\nPAr=154 mTorr, for which the tangents to the best-fit curve\nimply an even more dramatic deceleration, from\n17.7\u00b10.4 km\/s at 120 ns to just 8.0\u00b10.4 km\/s at 400 ns and\n2.6\u00b10.1 km\/s at 800 ns. Figure 11\u0001b\u0002 shows a similar set\nof xpeak versus t plots for fs ablation of graphite in Ar. In\nvacuum \u0004fig. 11\u0001b\u0002, v\u0005 a good linear relationship be-\ntween xpeak and time t is observed again, giving\n\u0006v\u0007=48.9\u00b10.1 km\/s. This value is significantly higher than\nfor ns pulses, a typical observation when comparing fs and\nns ablation.17,29 At higher pressures, a similar apparent decel-\neration of the emission peak is observed.\nAmoruso et al.37 have reported qualitatively similar trends\nin the case of Mg* atoms formed in the 351 nm PLA of an\nMgB2 target in low background pressures of Ar. As here,\nthey deduce an increasingly intense plume-background inter-\naction at increasing PAr, leading to a shock-wave-like expan-\nsion, plume confinement, and plume heating \u0001to an extent not\nfound in free plume expansion into vacuum\u0002. This, in turn,\nleads to enhanced emission from the plume core and en-\nhanced excitation\/ionization at the plume front where the\nhigh collision rate encourages conversion of the plume\nstream velocity into thermal energy.33,37 As in the case of\nMg* atoms from PLA of MgB2, we find that the data sets\nobtained at PAr\u00060, for both ns and fs pulses, are found to be\nreproduced well by a simple function of the form\nxpeak\u0007 t\n\b \u00012\u0002\n\u0001see Fig. 11\u0002. Such an expression was introduced to model\nthe expansion of a spherical blast-wave38\u2014wherein the ex-\nponent \b takes a limiting value of \u00030.4\u2014but, as in the\nMgB2 study,37 we find it to provide a very adequate descrip-\ntion of the time dependent propagation of the C+* emission\nfrom the shock wave produced by both ns and fs pulses.\nAfter examining the ablation in PAr, we briefly discuss the\nplume dynamics for fs ablation of graphite in PHe. For light\ncarbon atoms in a heavy Ar background, we can predict with\nsimple mechanics, that there will be significant backscatter-\ning of C atoms. For head-on collisions with He atoms, how-\never, which are lighter than C, we would expect no back-\nscattering. This fact, along with the smaller collisional cross\nsection for He means that a higher PHe, compared to Ar, is\nrequired to have a comparable effect on the plume dynamics.\nA review of the dynamics of plume propagation and splitting\nfor Si ns ablation in Ar and He is given by Wood et al.8\nFigure 12 shows a series of wavelength filtered CCD im-\nages of the fs ablation plume for PHe=4 Torr.

By 420\nns and beyond, the peak of the fast component has moved\nout of the viewing region. The remaining shock front decel-\nerates into the background gas, in a similar manner to the\nablation in Ar, but a gap at the point of the \u201carrow head\u201d is\nobserved which may be due to the fast component \u201csweeping\naway\u201d the background gas in the forward direction. Emission\nis also observed at the edges of the lower pressure region\nbehind the shock front. In addition to examining the C+*\nemission, the images in Figs. 12\u0001d\u0002\u201312\u0001f\u0002 were taken using\nthe filter which passes the C2\n* radical emission. The evolution\nof this distribution is very similar to that observed for the fs\nablation of graphite in Ar, the emission mainly coming from\nthe edges of the vacuum space produced by the passing ini-\ntial shock front. At times later than 900 ns, this emission\ndistribution changes shape into an arc of emission propagat-\ning away from the target.\nIn the same manner as before, the apparent velocity of\npropagation of the plume components can be extracted by\nanalyzing the profiles along the x-axis. One such profile,\nfrom the C+* filtered image at t=120 ns, is shown in Fig.\n13\u0001a\u0002. This profile clearly demonstrates a bimodal distribu-\ntion in the emission. By fitting the positions of these two\npeaks, and plotting them against the time \u0004see Fig. 13\u0001b\u0002\u0005 we\nextract a propagation \u0006v\u0007 of 83.3\u00b10.1 km\/s for the fast peak\nand a decelerating shock wave propagation for the slow com-\nponent. The \u0006v\u0007 of the fast component is much higher than\nthe velocity for C2+ ions extracted from the ablation in\nvacuum. It is suggested that this front component is due to\nhigh energy collisions, of the faster moving components in\nthe ablation plume \u0001which haven\u2019t suffered any collisions\nyet\u0002, with He atoms.\nThe rate of decrease in the deduced velocity with increas-\ning background pressure of inert gas \u0001Pinert\u0002 and\/or t might\nsuggest that, at the higher pressures studied, the ablated ma-\nterial would not reach the substrate. This is not necessarily\nthe case, however. It is probably worth reiterating that the\npresent experiments are sensitive only to that fraction of the\nplume material that is excited to the particular emitting states\nunder investigation. The peak in the spatial distribution of\nC+* ions at high Pinert is likely to be near the position of\nhighest plume density and thus highest collisional excitation\/\nionization probability. The velocity we derive at high Pinert is\nthus the propagation velocity of the shock wave formed as\nthe plume expands into the background gas. After impact\nexcitation, and subsequent radiative decay, the \u0001now dark\u0002\nspecies in the plume will propagate away from the shock-\nfront with some \u0001at least partially thermalized\u0002 velocity.\nClearly, the present experiments are blind to the substantial\namount of \u201cdark\u201d ablated material, some of which at least\nwill reach the substrate without suffering collisional excita-\ntion and will thus make no contribution to the measured\nvelocity.\nBefore going on to discuss the formation of C clusters in\nthe plume, we summarize the results of the plume imaging\nexperiments.\n\u0001i\u0002 For ablation in vacuum the velocity of C2+ ions in the\nplume can be extracted from series of images of C+* emis-\nsion. The value obtained for fs ablation is significantly larger\nthan that for ns pulses.\n\u0001ii\u0002 In plumes confined by ambient gas, the impact\nionization\/excitation of C species dominates the optical\nemission and can be used to track the position of the shock\nwave formed as the plume expands into the background gas.\n\u0001iii\u0002 For ns pulses the propagation of the shock wave is\nreproduced well by a spherical blast-wave model. For fs\npulses however, the plume dynamics are more complex. A\nprimary shock wave is produced by an initial burst of highly\nenergetic ablated C species. As the primary shock wave dis-\nsipates, a second shock wave is formed by the collisions of\nsubsequently ejected, slower moving material.\nFIG. 12.

PHYSICAL REVIEW B 72, 205413 \u00012005\u0002\n205413-10\nD. Cluster formation in the plume\nOnce the highly energetic ablated atomic material has\nbeen slowed by collisions, the formation of carbon clusters\nbecome a possibility. The size and bonding configuration\nwithin these clusters is then controlled by the plume tem-\nperature and the density of carbon atoms.11,30,31 We now dis-\ncuss how the initial plume dynamics observed here, for both\nns and fs pulses, affect the subsequent C cluster formation in\nthe expanding plume.\nThe element carbon has a rather unique property that it\nforms clusters at elevated temperatures, such as in flames,\nastrophysical environments and in laser vaporized carbon\nplumes.31,39 One important consideration regarding the\ngrowth of clusters in the plume is the source of the initial\ncluster seeds, which are likely to be C clusters with a small\nnumber of atoms \u0001N\u0002 . Three of the main sources for these\nseeds are likely to be the following: \u0001a\u0002 Collisions between C\natoms \u0001stabilized by a third body\u0002 as a source for C2 and\nbetween C2 and a C atom for C3. \u0001b\u0002 The direct ablation of\nsmall N clusters and chains and \u0001c\u0002 the collisional fragmen-\ntation of larger N clusters into multiple small N clusters. The\nrelative importance of the three suggested sources is likely to\nbe different for the two pulse durations. From the OES mea-\nsurements for fs ablation in vacuum, the higher relative in-\ntensity of C+* compared to C* emissions \u0001a trend that is\nreversed for ns pulses\u0002 could imply that the fraction of C\nablated as ground state atoms is less for fs pulses compared\nwith ns pulses. If so, the production of C2 by gas phase\nreactions would be expected to be less efficient for fs pulses.\nThis cannot be confirmed, however, as OES measurement\nare blind to the \u201cdark\u201d fraction of the plume. Also from the\nOES measurements, it appears that fs pulses directly eject\nmore C2 and C3 than for ns ablation. This is either due to the\nnature of the ablation mechanism, or to photodissociation of\nC clusters in the plume by the ns pulses. Simulations of the\nultrafast ablation of graphite have also shown that the abla-\ntion of fast monomers is accompanied by the production of\nsignificant numbers of C clusters and chains.14 The colli-\nsional fragmentation of larger clusters is likely to be mainly\ncontrolled by the background pressure in the chamber, which\nwill be irrespective of pulse duration. However, the initial\nproduction of these larger clusters will be determined by the\nnature of the initial ablation event.\nAfter formation of these clusters, the dominant growth\nmechanism is then expected to be single-atom attachment to\nlarger clusters.11,30 This process will be limited by the den-\nsity of C atoms in the plume. If the density of C2 and C3\nspecies in the plume is high enough, cluster growth by other\npurely binary collisions such as C2+C2\u2192C3+C and C2\n+C3\u2192C4+C could also be significant. Rode et al.11 postu-\nlated that a threshold density of C atoms in the plume is\nrequired for significant cluster formation, and that the char-\nacteristic time of formation \u0001tN\u0002 of an cluster with N atoms\ncan be estimated by\ntN =\n1\ne\nN\bnAr\nn1\n2 \t\n\t , \u00013\u0002\nwhere e is the base of the natural logarithm, n1 is the C atom\ndensity, nAr is the Ar atom density, \t is the C-Ar collision\ncross section, and \n is the C atom velocity.\nAlthough the fluences used for the two pulse durations\nwere similar, the ns pulses contained significantly more en-\nergy and typically ablate considerably more material per\npulse.29 To a crude approximation it could be assumed that\nthe total amount of material ablated, per pulse, is propor-\ntional to the laser energy \u0001well above the ablation threshold\u0002.\nOf course, here we are ignoring the differences in the abla-\ntion mechanisms between fs and ns pulses. If this assumption\nis valid, the number of C atoms ablated into in the cluster\nforming regions of the plume will be smaller for fs pulses by\na factor of \u00038.5. If we assume that the size of the cluster\nforming region \u0001or at least the the region where the initial C2\nand C3 cluster seeds are formed\u0002 is represented by the vol-\nume of the shock wave observed during the plume imaging,\nthe density of carbon atoms for fs ablation would be in-\ncreased by a factor of \u00032 due to the enhanced plume con-\nfinement observed for fs pulses. Thus, if we combine these\ntwo factors, the tN for an cluster with N atoms should be \u000318\ntimes longer for the fs ablation compared with ns ablation. If\nwe assume that, for both pulse durations, the plume remains\nat suitable temperature for cluster formation for similar\namounts of time, we would expect much smaller clusters to\nbe produced in the case of fs ablation. This will be irrespec-\ntive of the initial density of cluster seeds produced by the\ntwo pulse durations. Indeed, from the SEM images shown in\nFig. 1, there was no evidence for the deposition of carbon\nnanofoam material when using fs pulses. This may be an\nindication that the growth of the larger clusters was not oc-\ncurring. However, analysis of the cluster size in the plume by\nprobe beam scattering experiments should be performed to\nconfirm this hypothesis.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nWavelength filtered imaging of the plume emissions ac-\ncompanying the 248 nm PLA of graphite with short and\nultrashort pulses, in different background pressures of inert\ngas, was performed. For ablation at low PAr \u0001\u000b20 mTorr\u0002\nthe propagation of C species in the plume appeared to be\nrelatively unaffected by the gas. The deduced kinetic ener-\ngies of C2+ ions \u0001inferred from the images of C+* emission\u0002\nin this regime was \u0003100 eV, a value traditionally associated\nwith the formation of dense, sp3 rich, a-C films, as was ob-\nserved. The mean velocity of the plume components was\nnoticeably reduced at higher PAr, as a result of collisions, the\nC+* emissions in this regime were deduced to be dominated\nby impact ionization and excitation. Shock wave formation,\nas the plume tried to expand against the background gas, was\nclearly evident at PAr\u000368 mTorr. At PAr\u0006150 mTorr, the\ndeduced deceleration of the shock wave with increasing t\ncould imply that much if not all of the plume expansion\nwould dissipate before reaching the substrate. Consistent\nwith this view, we observe deposition of low density, fila-\nmentary films in this pressure regime, suggesting that the\nmajority growth species are clusters formed in the gas phase,\nwhich reach the substrate with energies below that required\nfor coalescence into the bulk of the film to occur. This sug-\ngestion is supported by the TEM images of the samples that\nappear to show that these films grow by diffusion limited\naggregation of nanoscale carbon clusters.\nDYNAMICS OF CONFINED PLUMES DURING SHORT\u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW B 72, 205413 \u00012005\u0002\n205413-11\nFor ablation with fs pulses, the propagation of two shock\nwaves was observed. It is suggested that the first is associ-\nated with an initial burst of highly energetic\/electronically\nexcited ablated components, indicative of the enhanced frac-\ntion of nonthermal ejection mechanisms compared to ns ab-\nlation, and the second with subsequently ejected, slower\nmoving, material which could consist of thermally ejected C\natoms and clusters. Supporting this assignment, the presence\nof a lower pressure gap, behind the first shock front, is ob-\nserved for fs pulses. For ns ablation, the plume components\nare expected to have a more continuous spread of velocities\nas the source of \u201csuprathermal\u201d ions is likely to be absorp-\ntion of the laser radiation \u0001e.g., by inverse Brehmsstrahlung\nexcitation\u0002 by the expanding thermally generated plume,\nleading to heating, excitation and ionization of the plume\nconstituents.\nThe enhanced confinement of the initial shock wave and\nthe suggested increase in production of C clusters, for fs\npulses, could be beneficial for the growth of C nanoclusters,\nbut the significantly smaller volume of material ablated per\npulse leads to a much lower C atom density in the plume,\nwhich limits the growth of clusters. One method to overcome\nthis drawback would be to use high-repetition-rate laser ab-\nlation, where the time between successive pulses is less than\nthe dwell time of the carbon atoms in the plume. In this\nregime the C atom density can be \u201cpumped\u201d and sustained at\ncluster forming levels. The reported plume energetics can be\napplied to ablation in many material system and also has\napplicability for cathodic arc deposition under background\npressures.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank Professor Costas Fotakis for his assis-\ntance with this project and S.J.H. and G.M.F. would like to\nthank A.
