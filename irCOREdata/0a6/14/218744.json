Informed by research on media \nliteracy, this article examines the role of selected measures of internet literacy in \nrelation to teenagers\u2019 online experiences. Data from a national survey of teenagers in \nthe UK (N=789) are analyzed to examine, first, the demographic factors that influence \nskills in using the internet and then, the main focus of the study, to ask whether these \nskills make a difference to online opportunities and online risks. Consistent with \nresearch on the digital divide, path analysis showed a direct influence of age and \nsocioeconomic status on young people\u2019s access, a direct influence of age and access \non their use of online opportunities, and a direct influence of gender on online risks. \nThe importance of online skills was evident insofar as online access, use and skills \nwere found to mediate relations between demographic variables and young people\u2019s \nexperience of online opportunities and risks. Further, an unexpected, positive \nrelationship between online opportunities and risks was found, with implications for \npolicy interventions aimed at reducing the risks of internet use.  \n \nKeywords \nInternet, teenagers, skills, literacy, online risks and opportunities  \n 2 \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe many hopes and fears regarding the opportunities that the internet can offer to \nchildren and young people, along with its attendant risks, have attracted considerable \nattention (Buckingham, 2004; Kaiser Family Foundation, 2005; Wolak, Mitchell and \nFinkelhor, 2006). The result is a series of pressing questions for policy makers, \nregulators, industry and the public about whether, in practice, young people are taking \nup these opportunities, whether some are benefiting more than others, and which \nfactors might facilitate the beneficial uses of the internet in an equitable manner. \n \nThese opportunities are widely judged to include learning, communication, \nparticipation, creativity, expression and entertainment \u2013 a heterogeneous set of \nactivities for which there is considerable optimism and public\/private sector provision \n(Jackson et al., 2007; Livingstone, 2004; Norris, 2001). Equally pressing, however, \nare the questions regarding whether young people are encountering risks online, \nwhether some are particularly at risk, and which factors might mitigate against the \nrisks of internet use. These risks, also encompassing a heterogeneous set of intended \nand unintended experiences, include encountering pornographic, self-harm, violent, \nracist or hateful contents online, inappropriate or potentially harmful contact via \ngrooming or harassment, and, attracting recent attention, problematic conduct among \npeers such as bullying, \u2018happy slapping\u2019 or privacy invasions of one kind or another \n(Liau, Khoo and Ang, 2005; Livingstone and Haddon, 2008; Ybarra, 2004). \n \nTo be sure, there is considerable scope for interpretation and contestation \u2013 both \nconceptually and between adults and children \u2013 regarding the allocation of specific \nactivities to the category of opportunities or risks. Nonetheless, it appears widely \nassumed that these categories are to be conceptualised as mutual opposites, with \nacademic, policy and popular discourses asserting that, for example, increasing \nopportunities will distract children from exploring risky activities, or that policy \nshould aim to reduce risks and increase opportunities, or that children\u2019s desire to \nevade adult-approved activities will lead them towards online risk-taking. \n \nIn the main, take up of opportunities has been the focus of the digital divide or, more \nrecently, digital exclusion debate, where inequalities in the nature and benefits of \ninternet use has attracted particular attention (Norris, 2001; Van Dijk 2005). In a \nparallel and often unrelated research literature, an examination of the nature and \nincidence of online risks has sought to identify vulnerable or \u2018at risk\u2019 youth and the \nconditions and consequences of potentially harmful experiences (Berson and Berson, \n2005; Mitchell, Finkelhor and Wolak, 2003). Both traditions up till now have \nconcentrated on demographic factors \u2013 age, gender, socioeconomic status, and others \n\u2013 but recently, both are turning their attention to questions of and whether online \nskills, competences or other socio-psychological factors may influence the range of \nopportunities taken up or risks encountered (Durndell and Haag, 2002; Eastin and \nLaRose, 2000; Leu et al., 2004). \n \nCrucially, it is increasingly recognised that these skills are also unevenly distributed. \nIn other words, although young people are often in the vanguard when it comes to \nusing, and to developing new uses for, the internet, compared with many adults \n(Dutton, di Gennaro and Millwood Hargrave, 2005; Livingstone and Helsper, 2007b; \n 3 \nOfcom, 2006), there is good reason to question the popular assumption that children \nand young people are \u2018cyber-experts\u2019. It seems that they do not always find online \ncontents and services easy to access and use in a manner that both meets their needs \nand avoids the attendant risks. For example, many young people have yet to learn \nadequate techniques for accessing and searching content, and their critical and \ncreative skills remain rudimentary and often little practiced (Facer and Furlong, 2001; \nHargittai, 2002; Pew, 2004, although see Pew, 2007). \n \nIn this article, we specifically seek to examine the experience of opportunities and \nrisks in the same study, in order to ask whether those with more online skills take up \nmore opportunities and, further, avoid more risks (see Livingstone and Helsper, \n2007a, for a study of the role of other socio-psychological factors). The skills and \ncompetences required for effective internet use are increasingly theorized in terms of \nliteracy, often by drawing on and adapting to new circumstances the long tradition of \nresearch on media literacy and media education (Buckingham, 2004; Potter, 2004; \nTyner, 1998; Warnick, 2002). Some take as their starting point the attempt to identify \nthe basic skills and techniques required to go online, while others focus on the end \npoint - an ambitious specification of the interpretive and critical abilities required of \nonline experts. In the present analysis, we draw theoretically from the concise and \nwidely-adopted definition of media literacy developed in a key conference a decade \nago, namely that media literacy is the ability to access, analyze, evaluate and create \nmessages in a variety of forms (Christ and Potter, 1998). \n \nThus we define internet literacy as a multidimensional construct that encompasses the \nabilities to access, analyze, evaluate, and create online content. These abilities, we \nsuggest, have substantial continuities with older forms of literacy, but the \ndiscontinuities are likely to occasion more difficulty for users (for example, knowing \nhow to access and search online content is very different from finding a book in a \nlibrary or a program on television). These four components together constitute a \nskills-based approach to media literacy, with each supporting the others as part of a \nnon-linear, dynamic learning process. It is expected that gaining the skills to access \ncontent aids the analysis of content produced professionally by others; that critical \nskills encourage the user to create their own content; and that experience of content \ncreation facilitates further access to content tools and techniques, and so forth \n(Buckingham, 2005). \n \nThe advantage of a skills-based definition of internet literacy is that it offers a viable \nresearch strategy, postponing for present purposes the important intellectual, semiotic \nand political debates over the relation between literacy as an individual skill and a \nsocial or societal approach to literacy (see Livingstone, 2004; Snyder 2001; Warnick, \n2002). It also opens the way for researchers to tackle the difficult task of measuring \ninternet literacy in terms of constitutive skills, for even this is not easy (Hargittai, \n2005; Hobbs and Frost, 2003; Stanley, 2003). Qualitative work reveals the forms of \ninternet literacy at stake in varying social contexts of use (Bakardjieva, 2005; Ribak, \n2001; Valkenburg and Soeters, 2001; Van Rompaey, Roe and Struys, 2002), while \nsurveys examine the distribution and, in part, the consequences of such expertise \n(Kaiser Family Foundation, 2005; Lenhart, 2005). There is ongoing research \ndeveloping measures for the specific skills involved, these permitting reliable \ndifferentiation among internet users (e.g., Potosky, 2002; Spitzberg, 2006; Torkedeh \nand Van Dyke; 2002; Yang and Lester, 2003). Developing skills both draws on and \n 4 \nencourages confidence in using the internet: Eastin and LaRose(2000) have applied \nthe concept of \u2018self-efficacy\u2019 to the internet, since work on self-efficacy in educational \ncontexts (Bandura and Locke, 2003; Bandura et al., 2001) shows that belief in one\u2019s \nown skills can be as important to academic achievement as one\u2019s actual skills. \n \nUnderstanding the nature (e.g. dimensions or aspects of skills and competences), \nantecedents (e.g. domestic context, conditions of access) and consequences (e.g. range \nor sophistication of uses) of internet literacy is complex and still developing. Hence \nwe begin simply by examining two commonly discussed measures of the access \ndimension of internet literacy: first, a measure of online (access-related) skills and, \nsecond, a global measure of internet self-efficacy. Conducted as part of a multi-\npurpose survey of teenagers\u2019 online usage, our aim is to explore any links among \ndemographic, skill\/self-efficacy, opportunity and risk variables as a contribution to the \nbroader understanding of the role of internet literacy in mediating the consequences of \ninternet use. \n \nResearch Questions \n \nThis article reports on the analysis of a national survey of 1511 children and young \npeople aged 9-19 years old in the UK where, in 2004, three quarters of households \nwith children in the UK had domestic internet access, and 98% of 9-19 year olds had \nused the internet (92% at school, 75% at home and 64% elsewhere; Livingstone and \nBober, 2005). Focusing on the data for teenagers (12-17 years, N=789), we examine \ntwo research questions: (1) Do online skills and self-efficacy facilitate the take up of \nthe range of online opportunities available? (2) Do online skills and self-efficacy \nreduce the breadth of risks experienced online? Additionally, since demographic and \nhousehold factors are also likely to influence teenagers\u2019 opportunities and risks \nonline, the relations been these factors and those of skill, self-efficacy, opportunities \nand risks are also systematically examined. \n \nRecent research has identified a number of relations among these different contextual \nfactors, providing grounding for the present analysis. This shows, first, that three \ntraditional measures of inequality - age, gender, socioeconomic status (SES) \u2013 \ninfluence access, use and online skills. Thus, boys and older children gain \nearlier\/better access to computers and the internet (Durndell and Haag, 2002) and use \nit more and are more skilled online (Facer et al., 2001; Livingstone and Helsper, \n2007b \u2013 although for adults, age and skills are negatively correlated; Fallows, 2005). \nSES also affects the adoption and use of new technologies (Calvert et al., 2005; \nNorris, 2001). Second, and obviously, access is a prerequisite for use and for the \ndevelopment of online skills; more importantly, it is widely assumed, though less \noften demonstrated, that better quality access (e.g. more access locations, fast \nconnectivity, more powerful machine, etc) facilitates greater use and, perhaps, further \nskill or self-efficacy (e.g. encouraging confidence, exploration and learning; Facer and \nFurlong, 2001). \n \nNote here that the argument that access, in and of itself, enables greater online \nopportunities is, of course, at the heart of policy interventions designed to provide \nhardware and connectivity for children who are otherwise disadvantaged; though note \ntoo that these interventions rarely discuss the implications for the experience of risk. It \nis likely that access to a broader range of access locations relates to more \n 5 \nunsupervised access and thus more independent use of the internet (Helsper 2007). \nTherefore a larger number of access locations is likely to be related to higher skill \nlevels and to a broader use of the internet in terms of both opportunities and risks. \nFurther, as hinted in the foregoing, the literature assumes a positive and mutual \nassociation between use and various measures of literacy, though we only find \nevidence supporting this assumption for adults (Dutton, Di Gennaro and Millwood-\nHargrave 2005; Pew 2004) and in relation to television rather than internet \n(Mangleburg and Bristol, 1998); moreover, Kraut, Kiesler, Boneva and Shklovski \n(2006) found no evidence that \u2018mere\u2019 use brings about internet literacy among \nchildren. \n \nThere is evidence that demographic factors directly influence young people\u2019s \nexperience of online opportunities and risks. Older children, it seems, both take up \nmore opportunities (educational, civic, communication, creative, etc; Livingstone and \nBober, 2004) and encounter more risks (possibly because they are more adventurous, \nless obedient, or less supervised; Berson and Berson, 2005; Mitchell, Finkelhor and \nWolak, 2003). Although there is little evidence regarding gender differences in \nopportunities (Subrahmanyam et al., 2001; though see Helsper 2007), it does seem \nthat boys take more risks online (Jackson et al., 2001; Weiser 2000, although see \nMitchell et al., 2003). Last, there is evidence that those from higher SES homes not \nonly have better internet access but also that they take up a greater range of \nopportunities online (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2005; Livingstone and Helsper, \n2007b), not least because these same children are those more likely to use the internet. \nThough as yet there is little or no evidence linking SES and risk. \n \nWhere does internet literacy fit in to the explanation of the consequences of use \u2013 both \nopportunities and risks? Though only examined here in terms of basic online skills \nand self-efficacy, for practical reasons concerning available measures and the limits of \nsurvey administration, it may be supposed that beginners who are inexperienced in the \nskills required to access online contents and services are missing out on the benefits \nthat the internet can offer. More advanced users, by contrast, are expected to have the \nskills and confidence required to access and benefit from these opportunities (Facer et \nal., 2001). As regards the risks, more skilled users are also expected to know how to \navoid the risks or problems of the internet (Berson and Berson, 2005; Machill et al., \n2004; Spitzberg, 2006), while those who encounter problems may be said to lack \ninternet literacy. It is this rationale that results in policy makers targeting most safety \ninformation at beginners (Internet Crime Forum, 2000). \n \nClearly, there is some \u2013 more or less convincing \u2013 evidence to link most of the factors \ntraditionally used to measure the antecedents and consequences of children and young \npeople\u2019s internet use. Because research projects commonly include just a few of these \nvariables, it is hard to grasp the overall pattern of interrelationships; it is also hard to \nidentify any indirect effects or yet more complex paths of influence, the focus \ngenerally being on the direct effects of one variable on another. To address the \ncomplexity of internet use, we propose a sequentially-ordered structural model, as \nshown in the path diagram (Figure 1). \n \n 6 \nFigure 1 \nHypothesized Path Model \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn this path diagram, arrows leading from the exogenous (or predictor) variables to the \nendogenous (or predicted) variables represent the relationships between them (Bollen, \n1989; Kline, 2005), with the sign (+ or -) indicating whether the relationship is a \npositive or negative one. Thus, the demographic variables are here assumed to be \ncausally prior to variables measuring internet access and use. Similarly, it is proposed \nthat access precedes internet use and literacy. However, no causal priority can be \nasserted between use and literacy as each is likely to influence the other. Last it is \nhypothesized that the breadth of opportunities and risks experienced by teenagers on \nthe internet will be accounted for by a combination of these variables. In addition to \nthese direct relations, mediated relations consist of an indirect link between two \nvariables, depending on an intermediate variable. For example, the model proposes \nthat demographic variables have both a direct influence on internet literacy and also \nan indirect effect via their effect on access. The reasoning is that older children are \nlikely to have greater online skills but that, in addition, older teenagers have greater \naccess and that greater access leads to higher internet literacy and to more \nunsupervised use (i.e. to more opportunities and risks). Given the paucity of relevant \nresearch, no a priori relation is postulated for the relation between opportunities and \nrisks. \n \nMethod \n \nA national survey was conducted via an in-home, face to face interview with 1511 \nchildren and young people aged 9-19, using Random Location sampling across the \nUK between January and March 2004.\n1\n Following the design and piloting of the \nsurvey questionnaire by the research team, fieldwork was carried out by a reputable \nmarket research company using computer-assisted personal interviewing. Informed \nconsent was obtained from all respondents and their parents. Sensitive questions (e.g. \n\u2022 j\n 7 \nrelating to viewing pornographic or hate websites, or meeting people online) were \ncontained in a self-completion section to ensure privacy (from researcher and parent).  \n \nIn the analyses that follow, only responses from the 12 to 17 year olds who use the \ninternet at least once per week are included (N=789), as only for these teenagers were \nall variables measured.\n2\n The sample comprised 49% girls and 51% boys, with an \naverage age of 14 years (s.d. = 1.75). The household SES, measured using standard \nUK market research categories (Reynolds, 1990), was 30% AB (upper\/middle class), \n26% C1 (lower middle class), 21% C2 (skilled working class) and 24% DE (unskilled \nworking class\/not working). Other measures employed were as follows. \n \nAccess. This was measured in two ways. Access locations (total out of 10) summed \nthe number of locations the respondent had ever used to access the internet (computer \nat school\/college, computer\/laptop at home, computer laptop in someone else's house, \ncomputer in public library, computer in an internet caf\u00e9 or kiosk, computer at parent's \nwork, computer in your own work place, digital television at home, mobile\/WAP \nphone, and games console at home). Years of access was calculated by subtracting the \nage when they first gained access from their present age.  \n \nUse. This was measured in two ways. Frequency was a scale ranging from 8 (uses \nmore than once day) through 5 (uses once a month) to 1 (never uses) on which \nrespondents rated their frequency of internet use. Time online was a composite \nmeasure based on the respondent\u2019s judgment of how much time (options: 1=none, \n2=about ten minutes, 3=about half an hour, 4=about an hour, 5=between one and two \nhours, 6=between two and three hours or 7=more than three hours) they spent online \non an average weekday and weekend day. \n \nInternet literacy. This was measured in two ways. Skills (total out of 7, Cronbach\u2019s \n\u03b1=0.70) summed the specific activities the respondent claimed to be good at (options \n\u2013 finding the information you need on the web, setting up an email account, sending \nan instant message, downloading and saving an MP3 (music) file, setting up a filter \nfor junk mail or pop up adverts, getting rid of a virus on your computer, and fixing a \nproblem by yourself when something goes wrong). Self-efficacy was a 4-point scale \n(Eastin and LaRose, 2000) on which respondents self-rated their online skill as \nbeginner, average, advanced, or expert. \n \nOpportunities. A composite measure which summed the total number of opportunities \nthat each respondent had taken up online (total out of 30, \u03b1= 0.76).To cover the range \nof young people\u2019s online activities, response items were drawn from research and \nopinion surveys of internet use (e.g. Dutton et al., 2005; Kaiser Family Foundation, \n2005; Ofcom, 2006; Pew, 2004).

Older teenagers, boys, and those from higher SES \nhouseholds have greater access to the internet (measured by number of access \nlocations and years online). Further, SES affects amount of use, with middle class \nteenagers using the internet more frequently and for longer on an average day; similar \nfindings hold for age, with older teens using the internet more. However, boys do not \ndiffer from girls in amount of use (measured by frequency of use and time spent \nonline on an average day). As regards online skills and self-efficacy, these were \npositively associated with age and SES, as expected; again gender differences were \nnot significant. \n \nIn terms of opportunities, older and middle class teenagers took up more online \nopportunities, though there were no gender differences.\n5\n Meanwhile, for online risks, \nolder teens and boys were shown to encounter more risks as too, unexpectedly, did \nmiddle class compared with working class teenagers.\n6\n \n \nComplicating matters, these different measures were themselves interrelated. Thus, \ninternet access was positively associated with internet literacy, and internet use. \nInternet use was also positively associated with internet literacy and with online \nopportunities and risk. Furthermore, internet literacy was positively related to online \nopportunities. Unexpectedly, however, internet literacy was positively associated with \nonline risks. This suggests that the greater the young person\u2019s online skills and self-\nefficacy, the more - rather than the fewer - risks they encounter online. Last, and also \nunexpectedly, online risks and opportunities were themselves positively correlated \u2013 \nindeed, this is the highest correlation in the table. \n \nPath analysis \nCorrelations do not indicate whether relationships between variables are direct or \nindirect. Path analysis assesses the relative importance of direct and indirect causal \npaths to the dependent variable(s). Thus it can determine whether the model shown in \nFigure 1 can explain the pattern of correlations shown in Table 3. The statistical \nprogram AMOS5 was used to test the hypothesized path model, using the variables in \nTable 3. \n \nThe final path model (\u03c72(24)=61,26, p=0.00), shown in Figure 2 and Table 4, was \nconstructed from a base model in which variables were related to other variables \nbased on the sequence as modelled in Figure 1.  \n \nGiven the relative lack of prior literature on the relation between opportunities and \nrisks, we had not initially hypothesised any directional relationship between them. \nHowever, based on the simple correlations showing that skills, self-efficacy, years and \ntime online are all more strongly correlated with opportunities than with risks, \ntogether with statistical analyses showing that the relationship with skills and \nexpertise was stronger for the direction from opportunities to risks than vice versa, a \npath was added from opportunities to risks. Consistent with this, we note that the \npublished literature provides little rationale for supposing that seeking risks might \n  12 \nlead to opportunities (hence we did not directly test this direction), while the reverse \ndirection which we find to be strongly present) is more plausible, following the \nargument that it is more likely that opportunities are causally prior to risks. That is, \nyoung people need to be online and do a variety of things online before they \nencounter risks. \n \nNon significant paths were then fixed to zero. The model fit was considered \nacceptable based on the following indicators for complex models: RMSEA values of \nlower than 0.05 (with a confidence interval in its entirety under 0.10), and a CFI value \nhigher than 0.9 (Kline, 2005).\n7\n The order of the variables and the direction of the \nconnections among them in the model were based on the theory and hypotheses \npresented earlier. Note that not all variables influence each other to an equal extent \nand that some influence each other only indirectly through other variables (see Figure \n2 and Table 4).\n \nWe examine the findings for each variable in turn, working from the \nleft hand side of the model to the right hand side (our main focus). \nFigure 2 \nPath Model for Online Opportunities and Risks \n \n \n \nBase: UK 12-17 year olds who use the internet at least once a week (N=789).  \nNote I: X2(24)=61.26, p=0.00, RMSEA=0.04 (confidence interval 0.03 to 0.06); \nCFI=0.98. \nNote II: For clarity, covariances were estimated between use, between literacy and \nbetween access variables, but omitted from the figure (see Table 4). \nNote III: For clarity, non-significant paths that were fixed to zero were omitted from \nthe figure. \n  13 \nTable 4  \nPath Coefficients for Figure 2 \nPredictor variable   Predicted variable b S.E. p \nGender ---> Years online -0.26 0.12 0.03 \nGender ---> Online risks -0.80 0.16 ** \nAge ---> Years online 0.34 0.04 ** \nAge ---> Access locations 0.09 0.03 ** \nAge ---> Time online 0.08 0.03 ** \nAge ---> Skills 0.15 0.03 ** \nAge ---> Online opportunities 0.34 0.07 ** \nSES ---> Access locations 0.31 0.04 ** \nSES ---> Years online 0.12 0.06 0.03 \nAccess locations ---> Skills 0.56 0.04 ** \nAccess locations ---> Self-efficacy 0.10 0.02 ** \nAccess locations ---> Frequency of use 0.13 0.02 ** \nAccess locations ---> Time online 0.37 0.04 ** \nAccess locations ---> Online opportunities 0.66 0.10 ** \nAccess locations ---> Online risks 0.14 0.06 0.03 \nYears online ---> Self-efficacy 0.07 0.01 ** \nYears online ---> Skills 0.14 0.04 ** \nYears online ---> Frequency of use 0.04 0.01 ** \nYears online ---> Time online 0.07 0.03 0.03 \nFrequency of use ---> Online opportunities 0.89 0.22 ** \nSkills ---> Online opportunities 0.90 0.08 ** \nTime online ---> Online opportunities 0.35 0.10 ** \nTime online ---> Online risks 0.13 0.06 0.02 \nOnline opportunities ---> Online risks 0.30 0.02 ** \n \nCovariances b S.E. p R \nAccess locations <--> Years online 0.31 0.09 ** 0.14 \nOnline skills <--> Self-efficacy 0.56 0.04 ** 0.50 \nOnline skills <--> Frequency of use 0.60 0.05 ** 0.50 \nTime online <--> Self-efficacy 0.32 0.04 ** 0.33 \nTime online <--> Frequency of use 0.50 0.04 ** 0.48 \nTime online <--> Online skills 1.06 0.10 ** 0.40 \nFrequency of use <--> Self-efficacy 0.17 0.02 ** 0.38 \n*p<0.05   **p<0.01 \nNote: The following non-significant paths were fixed to zero and omitted from the \ntable:  \nGender \uf0e0Access locations; Skills; Self-efficacy; Time Online; Frequency of use; \nOpportunities. \nAge \uf0e0 Self-efficacy; Opportunities. \nSES \uf0e0 Skills; Self-efficacy; Time Online; Frequency of use; Risks; Opportunities. \nYears online \uf0e0 Opportunities; Risks. \nSkills\uf0e0 Risks. \n  14 \nSelf-efficacy \uf0e0 Opportunities; Risks \nFrequency of use \uf0e0 Risks. \n \n \nAge. Age has a direct positive influence on access and use: older teenagers have better \nquality of access and use the internet longer. They also have better online skills (but \nnot self-efficacy). Age also has a direct influence on teenagers\u2019 online opportunities, \nover and above the beneficial influence of better access, use and skills. There is no \ndirect influence of age on online risks. The indirect paths, all significant at p<.05 \naccording to the Sobel test (Sobel, 1982) are also noteworthy. The extent to which \nolder teens are more skilled online and use the internet for longer stretches of time is \nmediated by quality of access. Thus teenagers with poorer access have lower \nconfidence in their skills and use the internet for shorter periods of time than those of \ntheir peers with better access. Further, since older teenagers have better access they \ntend to be more internet literate than younger teenagers. In addition to a direct \ninfluence of age on opportunities, there is an indirect influence of age on opportunities \nas mediated by access, use and skills. This suggests a virtuous circle of benefits \ngained both by older children and, comparing within age, by those with better access. \nAlthough these variables do not directly predict risks, since opportunities and risks are \npositively related, the positive effect of age on opportunities is accompanied by a \ngreater likelihood of risky encounters. \n \nGender. As with age, the correlation matrix showed gender to be associated with \nseveral measures of quality of access, use and literacy. However, in the path analysis, \nthe only direct effect of gender is on risky encounters: boys more than girls encounter \nonline risks. There is no direct effect of gender on opportunities taken up (although \nthe type of opportunities varies; Livingstone and Helsper, 2007b), and there was only \none direct effect on the years they have used the internet; boys have been online for \nlonger. However, there are no direct effects of gender on access, frequency of use or \nskills\/efficacy. This offers little support for popular idea that girls are less interested, \nconfident or skilled online. Indeed, we conclude that there are few gender differences \nin the online experience, with the notable exception of online risks; this seems largely \naccounted for by boys encountering more pornography (Table 2).\n8\n \n \nSocioeconomic status. With the exception of a direct influence of SES on access, the \npath analysis showed that the effects of SES on the other variables in the correlation \nmatrix are all indirect. The various benefits of higher SES on teenagers\u2019 use, literacy, \nand opportunities are, therefore, indirectly (and crucially) mediated by access. Those \nwho differ in SES but have equivalent access do not differ in skills\/self-efficacy. \nConversely, those similar in SES who differ in access also differ in skills\/self-\nefficacy. This is not to say that there is no SES gap overall in the population, but that \naccess is the determining factor (rather than, say, other factors associated with SES \nsuch as parental education or disposable time spent with children). \n \nAccess. Quality of access (access locations and years online) is positively related to \nboth amount of use and literacy. Thus, over and above the direct effects of age and \nSES, teenagers with better access (especially, more access locations) make more use \nof the internet and gain more online skills and self-efficacy. The number of access \nlocations, but not the number of years online, also has a significant direct influence on \nthe take up of online opportunities and risks (except indirectly, through the relation \nwith online opportunities; see below). Whether this is the effect of \u2018mere\u2019 access, or \n  15 \nwhether those with more access also benefit from other forms of support associated \nwith access (better resourced schools, more community support, more expert friends, \nmore independent, unsupervised access etc), cannot be established here. Last, \nalthough more years online does not result in more opportunities in and of itself, this \nis associated with greater online skills and self-efficacy and so has an indirect \nrelationship with online opportunities. \n \nUse. Time online per day and frequency of use both increase the opportunities taken \nup. Although time spent online is directly (and positively) related to risks, frequency \nof use it not. It seems that the link between use and risks is largely indirect: thus, use \n\uf0e0 opportunities, and opportunities \uf0e0 risks. Additionally, the relationship between \nuse and opportunities is indirect, mediated by that between use and skills. In other \nwords, those who use the internet more and are high in skills take up more \nopportunities than those who use it an equivalent amount but are lower in skills (note \nthat risks are not mediated by use in this way).  \n \nInternet literacy. The two literacy variables are strongly related to each other, yet they \nwork differently in the path analysis. Online skills (a self-assessment of specific \nskills) have a positive influence on online opportunities (and so an indirect influence \non risks). Self-efficacy (a global self-assessment of skills and self-confidence) has no \ndirect influence on either opportunities or risks. \n \nOpportunities and risks. The path analysis shows that the strong correlation between \nonline opportunities and risks is positive: the more opportunities a teenager takes up, \nthe more risks she or he is likely to encounter. Thus, online opportunities appear to \nencourage teens to do more on the internet, and this may result in more risk, \ndeliberately or inadvertently. Since boys\u2019 base level of risks encountered is higher \nthan that of girls (c.f. boys\u2019 risk-seeking behaviour; Slater, 2003), but their base level \nof opportunities does not differ, the eventual uptake of opportunities is equivalent for \nboys and girls. \n \nDiscussion and Conclusions \n \nThis article has found that teenagers are benefiting from a fair range of online \nopportunities, though there are still some they miss out on, hinting at considerable \nscope to encourage the depth and breadth of their online opportunities. Consistent \nwith previous evidence, it was found that older and middle class teenagers are \nbenefiting from a broader range of opportunities than are younger children and those \nfrom a working class background. It is particularly noteworthy that the experience of \nonline opportunities and risks \u2013 so often researched and discussed quite separately, as \nif unrelated, while frequently discussed in policy circles as if mutually opposed - was \ninstead found to be strongly positively related. In short, the findings show that those \nwho take up more opportunities encounter more risks and vice versa. Further, those \ngroups inclined to gain more opportunities (older, middle class, boys) also encounter \nmore risks (compared with younger, working class teens and girls). \n \nOur analysis has examined potential mediators of these relationships between \ndemographics and outcomes, as modelled in Figure 1. The emergent picture (Figure \n2) reveals the importance of indirect or mediated relations as well as direct relations \namong the variables. Thus the above summary must be qualified in important ways. \nAge directly influences opportunities, but it only indirectly influences risks: older \n  16 \nteenagers do more things online because they are older, but the reason they encounter \nmore risks online is not because they are older but because they tend to have better \naccess, use the internet more and\/or have greater online skills, and it is this that leads \nthem to seek a wider range of online opportunities. Socioeconomic status has no \ndirect influence on either opportunities or risks, but only influences access, this \nresulting in inequalities that have indirect but significant consequences. The policy \nimplication here is intriguing: while middle class parents often provide better access \nfor their children, for those middle and working class children with equivalent access, \nthere are few or no further, direct effects of SES on use, literacy or opportunities. \nEnhancing quality of access (i.e. more sites of access) for less privileged teenagers \ncould, therefore, reduce the digital divide that exists at present among young people. \n \nThe gender divide that existed for computers (Durndell and Haag, 2002; McIlroy et \nal., 2001) does not appear to carry over to the internet, though boys \u2013 irrespective of \naccess or skills - tend to encounter more risks, especially pornography (Valkenburg \nand Souters, 2001; Valkenburg and Peter, 2006). This is a direct relation, unmediated \nby boys having better access or skills or confidence online (which they do not). This \ninvites future research on other gender-linked factors such as the social norms that \nencourage boys and prevent girls engaging in risky activities, or the peer pressure that \nencourages boys to look at pornography. \n \nThe present analysis of mediating factors shows that a simple framework linking \nonline activities to demographic factors is insufficient in explaining the observed \nvariation in teenagers\u2019 experiences of the internet. Further, the tendency in research to \nstudy either opportunities or risks, often as part of quite separate research literatures, \nmisses the important connection between the desirable and risky outcomes of internet \nuse. In short, a more complex model is required to account for teenagers\u2019 online \nexperiences, with access, use and literacy all playing a role in mediating between \ndemographic factors and opportunities\/risks. \n \nWhile the digital divide literature has recognized the mediating role of access and, \nmore recently, use, this article has especially focused on the potential role of internet \nliteracy, drawing on the framework developed for research on media literacy. The \npresent examination of at least some aspects of internet literacy (capturing some of the \nonline skills required, as well as the confidence needed to self-identify as a competent \nuser) shows that online skills make a positive contribution to online opportunities; \nthey also mediate between demographic factors and access, and between access and \nopportunities. In other words, while demographics and access have a direct and \nbeneficial influence on opportunities, being more skilled helps too. This suggests that, \nin addition to interventions designed to equalize access, interventions targeted at \nincreasing specific skills will also enhance the take up of online opportunities. This \noffers support to the growing policy demand for teachers, educational providers and \neven the industry, child welfare and other organizations to establish and expand \ndigital literacy programmes so as to increase children\u2019s internet related competences \nand thereby benefit from the opportunities. \n \nContrary to the literature (Eastin and LaRose, 2000), self-efficacy did not mediate this \nrelationship. This may have been because self-efficacy was subject to a social \ndesirability bias, or because just a single response measure was used, or because \nconfidence among teenagers is not strongly related to actual ability. The composite \nmeasure of Skills, although also based on self-report, indexed concrete skills and \n  17 \ntechniques not especially important to self-identity; hence it may be less vulnerable to \nself-report biases and so provide a better measure of young people\u2019s online skills. In \nfuture research, an approach based on the measurement of skills may prove more \neffective than a global self-efficacy measure (see also Hargittai, 2005), although \nBandura\u2019s multiple indicator of self-efficacy developed for educational contexts might \nhelp to fine-tune the measurement of self-efficacy (Bandura et al., 2001). \n \nOnline skills are themselves influenced directly by age: irrespective of access or use, \nolder teenagers are more skilled and so take up more opportunities. This suggests that, \nalthough some online skills are internet-specific, other aspects of these skills are likely \nto draw on social and technical knowledge acquired in other contexts. As suggested in \nthe introduction, internet literacy may draw on media literacy (e.g. skills derived from \nexperience with print, critical knowledge, or technical expertise). Indeed, how the \ndifferent forms of literacy interact and support each other is a key question for future \nresearch, given today\u2019s complex and convergent media and information environment. \n \nFew studies to date have sought the \u2018big picture\u2019 in identifying the multiple and \ninterrelated influences on young people\u2019s internet use. Particularly, research on media \nor internet literacy has focused more on matters of definition and measurement than \non examining the antecedents and consequences of internet literacy. While parsimony \nmight suggest that demographic factors are sufficient to account for the online \nopportunities and risks experienced by teenagers, the present analysis showed that \ninternet literacy plays a key role in mediating the online experience and should, \ntherefore, be included in future research on access, use, opportunities and risks online. \n \nIn conclusion, it is not the case that those who benefit from more opportunities are \nmore likely to avoid online risks, nor that those with greater internet literacy have \nfound a way to avoid the risks as they pursue the opportunities. Taking up online \nopportunities proving, for many teenagers, an experience associated with some degree \nof risk. The strong, positive association between opportunities and risks points up the \ndilemma that parents and regulators face. Increasing opportunities increases the risks. \nRestricting internet use so as to reduce the risks is also likely to restrict the \nopportunities. It appears that, as with print literacy and other skills (social skills, \npractical skills), an increase in skills cannot ensure that the activities thereby enabled \nare socially approved ones. Learning to read, or to make friends, may result in \napproved reading or approved friends, or quite the contrary; similarly, online skills \n(and internet literacy conceived more broadly) enables young people to take up new \nonline opportunities and, thereby, encounter more risks. \n \nSince the range of risks investigated in this study includes both intentional and \nunintentional exposure to problematic content or contact, we suggest that further \nresearch is needed to clarify the nature of risks that are positively, rather than \nnegatively, related to online skills. We note, further, that the definition of risks and \nopportunities here largely accords with \u2018approved\u2019 definitions, particularly as \nemployed in policy debates: to teenagers, some of the activities here classified as risks \nare often seen rather as opportunities (e.g. making new friends online, giving out \npersonal information, even seeing pornography, for some). \n \nA next step for research, surely, would be to develop a more subtle account of online \nopportunities and risks, either better distinguishing them or acknowledging their \ninevitable overlap, as suggested here. Last, we note that as yet, clear findings \n  18 \nregarding the tangible benefits or actual harms consequent upon the experience of \nthese youthful opportunities and risky activities remain elusive. Much research, as in \nthis article, has been concerned to explore the conditions and correlates associated \nwith these activities, as these are amenable to exploration via self-report methods \n(whether surveys or interviews). Possibly by employing longitudinal or observational \nmethods, the next challenge for research in this field will need to tackle the \nconsequences \u2013 whether beneficial or harmful \u2013 of such activities. \n  19 \nEndnotes \n1\n In random location sampling, interviewers have little choice in selection of \nrespondent. Respondents are drawn from a small set of homogenous streets selected \nwith probability proportional to the population after stratification by their post-code \ncharacteristics and region. \n2\n Percentages were weighted to data in BMRB\u2019s Target Group Index and Youth \nsurveys. The weighting efficiency was 91%. Raw sample sizes and SEM analyses are \nbased on unweighted data. \n3\n A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to check that the skills items were \ndistinct from the items used to assess online opportunities and risks. The three factor \nsolution showed a better fit than a one factor factor model (\u03c72D(3)=545.40, p<.001). \nThe measures used for opportunities and skills pointed to distinct underlying factors \n(\u03c72D(1)=166.05, p<.001), indicating the treatment of skills, risk and opportunities as \nseparate scales was justified. \n4\n These risk assessments are based on the children\u2019s survey. When parents were \nsurveyed, reported levels of risk encountered by children were lower; parents may be \nunaware of their children\u2019s activities or they may define risk differently (Livingstone \nand Bober, 2005). \n5\n These averages mask some variation in the particular activities online: compared \nwith boys, girls were more likely to visit civic sites, use email and get careers and \neducational information, while boys were more likely to download music and video, \nplay games, shop, look for news or information on computers, and make a website. \nAlso, compared with younger teens, older teens were more likely to do a range of \ninteractive activities, visit civic sites, use instant messaging and email, shop or look \nfor information for leisure and for careers, and look for news; playing games was the \nonly activity undertaken more by younger than older teens. Socioeconomic status \nmade a difference in several ways. Middle class teenagers were more likely to \ncontribute to message boards, vote or sign a petition online, to visit civic sites, to use \ninstant messaging, shopping, looking for leisure information and news. Working class \nteenagers were only more likely to use chat rooms (see Livingstone, Bober, & Helsper \n2005). \n6\n Specifically, for online risks, boys are more likely to encounter online pornography, \nboth accidentally and on purpose, and more likely to seek out violent or gruesome \ncontent. Although boys are more likely to give out personal information online, girls \nare more likely to have been bullied online. Most risks are also more commonly \nencountered by older than younger teens, this including content, contact and privacy \nrisks. SES makes less difference here, though middle class teens are more likely to \nencounter pornographic or hate content accidentally (see Livingstone, Bober, & \nHelsper 2005 ). \n7\n In other words, more than one model fits the data, but this is the simplest fitting \nmodel which significantly explains the relationships between all the variables and in \nwhich all individual relationships are significant. \n  20 \n8 \nThe relationship between gender and risks could not be omitted because the model \nwould not fit statistically without it. The inclusion of the relationship between gender \nand opportunities was not necessary to reach good model fit. The relationships \nbetween gender and skills, use, and access were not significant in explaining online \nopportunities and risks (though they were themselves interrelated). Thus, in \nexplaining why teenagers experience risks and opportunities, the relationship between \ngender and these intermediating variables does not contribute significantly to model \nfit. \n  21 \nReferences \nBakardjieva, M.
