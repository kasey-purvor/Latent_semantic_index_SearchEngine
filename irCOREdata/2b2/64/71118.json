With a new heater cycling, where the heater is on for a \nshort time and then off for a long enough time for the dusty plasma conditions to \nreturn to its undisturbed conditions, a PMSE \u201cOvershoot\u201d effect is produced.  In the \novershoot the PMSE strength, when the heater is switched off, can increase by a \nfactor of several compared to what it was directly before the heater was switched on.   \nBy analysing the shape of the overshoot characteristic curve as the PMSE varies \nthrough a weakening as the heater is switched on, an overshoot as it is switched off \nand a subsequent relaxation back to an unaffected strength, we can obtain a \nconsiderable amount of information on the state of the PMSE dusty plasma. \nIn the present paper we will show results from a large  EISCAT overshoot campaign \nin July 2004 where the PMSE overshoot was observed frequently. The shape of the \nPMSE power variations in each overshoot cycle is shown to vary considerably with \nheight in the PMSE layer and also from cycle to cycle. We will show that very \ndifferent PMSE overshoot shapes can occur at various occasions, and heights, and \nhow they can be dependent on the local dust and plasma conditions.  \n \n* Manuscript\n1.Introduction.  The radar phenomenon PMSE (Polar Mesospheric Summer Echoes, \n(Cho and R\u00f6ttger 1997)), which occurs in the summer mesosphere between about 80 \nand 90 km, can be affected by artificial electron heating.  A weakening of the PMSE  \ncan be produced and has been  observed with the EISCAT  VHF  radar at 224 MHz  \n(Chilson et al., 2000, Belova et al., 2003),and the EISCAT UHF  radar at 933 MHz \n(La Hoz, personal communication),  The EISCAT Heating facility  (Rietveld et al., \n1993) used   in these experiments was run in equal and  short on and off intervals \n(from 10 to 20 sec) and it was found  in many, but not all, cases that the PMSE \nstrength was rapidly weakened when the heater was turned on, and  that it also \nreturned rapidly (Belova et al.,2003) to approximately the pre-heater value when the \nheater was turned off again. A strengthening of the PMSE, after the heater was \nswitched off compared to the value just before it was switched on, was predicted  by \nHavnes  (2004) to be possible when the heater was run in a cycle with a short on \nphase of typically 20 sec and a comparatively long off phase of 160 sec to allow the \nPMSE dusty plasma to relax back to its equilibrium state (Havnes et.al 2003, 2004).  \nThe phenomenon is called the \u201covershoot effect\u201d and the increase in strength is often \nobserved to be a factor of 2 to 3 and sometimes more.  As the heater is switched on  \nthe PMSE is weakened as before but can also show a substantial recovery in strength \nduring the heater on phase and then the rapid overshoot as the heater is switched off.  \nThe time variation of the PMSE strength during an overshoot heater cycling is called \nan Overshoot Characteristic Curve (OCC), and a typical form is shown in Figure 1 \nwhich shows the PMSE intensity at a given height throughout a heating cycle of 20 \nsec with the heater on and 160 sec off.   We see clearly the drop in PMSE intensity as \nthe heater is switched on at 09:12,  some recovery during the phase when the heater is \non and the large overshoot by a factor of approximately 4 as the heater is switched off \nwith a subsequent relaxation back to the undisturbed conditions. The exact shape of \nthe OCC depends on the parameters characterizing the dusty plasma \u2013 dust size and \ndensity and the plasma density (Havnes et.al 2003, 2004, Biebricher et.al 2004). We \nwill  show different cases of OCC as observed in a large overshoot campaign in July \n2004 involving the EISCAT Heater and  radars. In the present paper we concentrate \non the \u201cnormal\u201d overshoot cycling (20 sec with heater on and 160 sec off) and \ndemonstrate the large variety of OCC\u2019s which can occur.  We also show  modelling \nresults of OCC for conditions with different amounts of dust present and how this \npredict the different OCC which are observed. We will not discuss in any detail the \nphysics behind the suggested model for the overshoot, and how the various overshoot \nshapes reflect the dusty plasma conditions in the PMSE, but  refer to the papers by \nHavnes et.al (2004) and Biebricher et.al (2004) for this. Most of the other results from \nthe campaign, the UHF results and the effects of varying the heater transmitter power, \nmode and frequency and the cycling period have not been properly analyzed and will \nbe taken up in subsequent papers.  The results shown in this paper are for transmitter \nfrequency 5.423 MHz in the X-mode. \n \n2. The observational campaign. \nAfter the observation of the overshoot effect in 2003 (Havnes et.al 2003) it became \nclear that in order to exploit the phenomenon more fully in investigations of the \nPMSE conditions, it was necessary to obtain observations at a large variety of PMSE \nconditions and to investigate what effects changes in  the parameters of the heater   \ncould have on the overshoot effect.  Also, it would be desirable to increase the radar \nsampling time below the 5 sec used in 2003 to better resolve details in the OCC.  \nThese problems were addressed in the EISCAT 2004 Overshoot campaign involving \ngroups from EISCAT, Germany, Norway, Sweden and UK. The campaign lasted  \nfrom  July 5 to 15 with observations on 4 to 5 hours per day.  PMSE was observed \nmost of the time at VHF (224 MHz) and occasionally also at UHF (933MHz).  The \nfollowing observing schemes were applied on one or more of the observing days. \n1. The time resolution was 0.2 sec on all days. \n2. Heater cycle with 20 sec on and 160 sec off. \n3. Heater cycle with 10 sec on and 110 sec off. \n4. Heater cycle with 20 sec on and 100 sec off. \n5. Varying the heater power from 100%, in steps of 20% at subsequent heater \ncycles,  down to 20% of full power.  \n6. In a (\u201cpump-up\u201d) mode with a heater cycling with 5 consecutive 10 sec on and \n2 sec off and thereafter 120 sec off. \n7. Varying between heater transmitting in X and O mode in subsequent heating \ncycles with 20 sec on and 160 sec off. \n8. Most often the transmitter frequency was 5.423 MHz but a frequency of 6.96 \nMHz was also used. \n \n3. Preliminary results from the 2004 EISCAT overshoot campaign and some \ninterpretation of their OCC. \nThe preferred heater cycling was as in point 2 above.  It appeared that the 100 or 110 \nsec relaxation time of heater cycling 3 and 4 could sometimes be on the short side so \nthat a complete return to the equilibrium undisturbed plasma condition might not \nalways have taken place.  \nIn Fig.2 we show the raw data for the observations of one hour PMSE overshoots, \nwith the cycle 20s-160s, where clear overshoots are present in practically every heater \ncycle and throughout most of the height gates where PMSE is observed by the radar. \nThe PMSE in Fig.2 is a moderately strong one with a total vertical width of up to 5 \nkm  with much internal structure.  To better show the  presence of the overshoot \nduring the whole hour we show in Fig.3 the PMSE strength at one height (85.2 km) \nthroughout the whole hour.  The overshoot was present during the whole  observation \nperiod that day from 07h 36m  to 11h 00m  UT.  \nSince the PMSE structures can move considerably in height, as can be seen from \nFig.2,  the constant height scan can be somewhat misleading since it can miss the \nPMSE in certain time intervals.  To show in detail the height variation of the \novershoot we have picked one heater cycle where the heater was switched on at 09h \n45m  and show the results for both the 0.2 and 2 sec sampling in Fig.4.  We see  the \nclear overshoot in practically all height gates (300m height sampling) where the \nPMSE is apparent and also in the thin PMSE layer above the main layer. Fig.5 show \nthe PMSE intensity as a function of time for  height gates from 82.8 to 88.5 km where \nthe PMSE intensity has been corrected for variations in the radar transmitter effect \nsince this is affected somewhat by the heater activity.  \nIn the examples shown in Figs 1 to 5 the overshoot shapes are most often close to the \noriginal shapes which where modelled by Havnes et.al (2003) assuming that the dust \nwas not a dominant charge carrier in the PMSE, so that absorption by dust could be \nneglected.  This is probably often the situation for PMSE (Havnes et.al 2001) but it is \nalso clear that conditions where this is not the case, and where electron bite-outs are \nproduced (Pedersen et.al 1969, Ulwick et.al 1988) caused by the presence of dust \nparticles (Havnes et.al 1996), is not uncommon.  Biebricher et.al (2004) show that in \ncases where the dust charge density is no longer small compared to the electron \ndensity, so that absorption of free electrons by the dust particles play a role in \ndeciding the undisturbed plasma densities, the electron absorption efficiency increase \nas the electrons are heated. This will counteract the overshoot effect since it will lead \nto an overall reduction of the electron density when the heater is on so that the \novershoot is reduced, or in some cases wholly removed.  In Fig.6 we present model \ncalculations with the PMSE model  from Biebricher et.al (2004) for three cases, all \nwith a dust radius of 10 nm, and with low  to high dust  density as given in the figure. \nThe overshoots in Figs 1 to 5 appear to correspond mostly to cases with moderate to \nlow dust charge density, as shown by the moderate to low dust density cases of Fig.6.  \nThe comparatively large overshoot factors which are present indicate an electron \nheating which is larger than used in Fig.6 while the moderate recovery of the PMSE \nduring the 20 seconds the heater is on indicate that the dust particles are of medium \nPMSE sizes.  If we look at the same type of experiments on July 6, as shown in Fig.7, \nthe situation is different.  On this day the PMSE layer consisted of many relatively \nparallel weak layers. Although the effect of the heater is apparent in all the PMSE \nlayers, the overshoot effect is very often weak or apparently not present. If we \nconcentrate on one cycle, again choosing the cycle where the heating starts at 09h 45m, \nwe see the results for this cycle in Fig 8 for the raw data and in Fig.9 we show the \nPMSE intensity variations with time corrected for transmitter variations, for all the \nheight gates. There will certainly be arbitrary intensity variations, brought about by \nstructures being brought out of or into the radar beam by horizontal winds during the \nheater cycle, but it appears that we often have cases corresponding to the high density \ncase of Fig.6 where the PMSE is constant or weakened when the heater is on and the \novershoot is weak or absent.  This does not necessarily mean that the dust charge \ndensity is large but that it is comparable to, or larger than, the electron density. \nFrom the observations of the 20 sec-160 sec heater cycling which we have examined, \ntotalling by now about 12 hours of observations, it appears that the heater in most of \nthe cycles has some effect on the VHF PMSE.  Although the effect in some cases can \nbe small or absent, in different cycles or at different heights, it is surprising that the \nheating and overshoot effect often is clearly present over very large height ranges. \nIn Fig.10 we show one hour observation where we have varied the heater transmitter \npower as described in the figure text.  The PMSE consists two weak layers with the \nstrongest at the bottom.  Although the layers sometimes are 8-9 km apart the heating \ncan be clearly seen in both layers.  In Fig.11 we show, as in Figs.5 and 8, the PMSE \nprofiles for different heights. We focus on the lower and upper layer and see clear \nheating effects from the gate at 81.3 km to the one at 89.7 km, corresponding to a \nheight span of 8.4 km. The overshoot effect is not present at all gates where the heater \neffect is seen but is most pronounced in the upper part of the layer.  In the lower layer \nthe profiles may correspond to the high dust density cases.  \nIf we look at Fig.9 we see that the heating effect is present in the majority of the \ncases, also when the heating transmitter power is low.  In fact, a closer inspection \nshow that the heater effect is without doubt present at 40% of the power and that also \nsome indications of its effects are also seen in  the cycles where the power is only \n20% as can be seen from Fig. 12. \n4. Discussion. \nIt is apparent, both from the overshoot observations from 2003 (Havnes et.al 2003), \nand the results from the 2004 overshoot campaign, that the reaction of the PMSE  to \nthe artificial electron heating can  very different on different occasions and also at \ndifferent heights at the same time.  Since this occurs also when the transmitter and \nradar characteristics are kept constant the changes of the OCC must be caused by \nphysical differences of the PMSE within the different radar sampling volumes.  This  \nshould therefore open up for the possibility of using the PMSE overshoot to diagnose \nthe PMSE dusty plasma conditions, as earlier predicted and modelled (Havnes et.al \n2004, Havnes 2004, Biebricher et.al 2004).  According to the modelling of the \novershoot, the dust sizes and their densities, compared to the plasma densities, are \nmost important in determining the OCC. With a knowledge of the electron densities, \nwhich sometimes probably can be obtained from UHF measurements or other \ninstrumentation, we should be able to extract information both of the dust sizes and \ntheir radius.  These parameters are normally not available except on sites where \nmulticolour lidars are available (von Cossart et.al 1999), or with direct sampling by \nrocket dust probes (eg Havnes et.al 1996). In addition to this the lidars normally \nrequire comparatively large dust particles for reliable detection.  \nIt is also clear from the observations that to find the OCC from observations is not \nalways straightforward, unless the PMSE layers are slowly varying in strength and \nheight, since large variations of PMSE can occur on timescales comparable or shorter \nthan the heater cycling we have used.  Efforts should therefore be directed at the OCC \nfor such variations.  While this most likely can be done for PMSE varying at a time \nscale not very much shorter than the heater cycling period of 3 min, the large \nvariations we observe also from sampling to sampling both at 0.2 and 2 sec represent \na more serious problem.  They can seriously affect the determination of the reduction \nin PMSE intensity as the heater is switched on and off, and the shape  of the PMSE \nduring the heater on phase which all are very important in a comparison with PMSE \nmodels.   \nThe many different observations we have obtained represent a challenge for the \nexisting models for the PMSE and the overshoot effect in that they have to explain \nand extract information on the different physical conditions.  While, as discussed \nbefore, many of the observed OCC fit well into the classes of shapes which have been \npredicted, we also find several cases which apparently have OCC  different from the \nmodel results. Some such cases are shown in Fig.13 for one heater cycle where we see \ncases where the effect on the PMSE as the heater is switched on is small, so that little \nor no heater on effect is present but where still the overshoot is considerable.  This \nindicates that the comparatively simple models for the heating and overshoot which \nhave been presented until now should be improved.  \n \nReferences \nBelova,  E., P. B. Chilson, S.

The radar samples \nwith a resolution of 300 m and the PMSE layer in this case  extended from \nabout 83 to 87 km.  The heater was switched on at 09h 12m UT  and off at 09h \n12m 20s. \n \nFig.2.  The raw data of PMSE observations with overshoot heating cycles of 3 min \nperiods (20 sec heater on and 160 sec off) with heater on starting at 09h 00m. \nThe PMSE intensity is in an arbitrary scale. \n \nFig.3. The PMSE overshoot intensity at constant heights. \n \nFig.4  The raw data for one overshoot heater cycle shown with 0.2 sec and 2 sec  \nsampling.  The heater is switched on at sample number 200, respectively 20, and off \nat 300 or 30, corresponding to a heater on period of 20 sec. \n \nFig.5. As for Fig.4 but showing the PMSE intensity variation with time at 20 height \ngates. The heater is on between the dotted lines. \n \nFig. 6.  Three cases of overshoot cycles for dust particles of radius 10 nm with 3 \ndifferent dust densities given in the figure (in particles cm-3).  The electron \ntemperature, as the heater was switched on at 0 sec, was assumed to  go from \n150 to 450 oK. \n \nFig.7. As in Fig.2 but for the 6th of July, 2004. \n \nFig. 8.

In this one hour observation the heater transmitter power is varied from 100% \npower at each 15 min, starting at 10h 00m, with the power  reduced in equal \nsteps down to 20% at the fifth heating cycle.  After this we repeat the same 15 \nmin cycle. \n \nFig. 11 show the PMSE power variations at different heights where we have \nconcentrated on the two layers, the low and the high.  In this heating cycle the \nheater transmitter power is at 80% of full power. \n \nFig 12. PMSE time profiles for one heater cycle at different heights from 81 to 88.5 \nkm.
