This periodisation is based on a study and \nanalysis of the evolving roles of accommodation providers in Vietnam tourism and the \nshifting patterns of state-owned enterprises, foreign direct investment and private \nbusinesses \/ SMEs in this sector. Each period, and each transition between consecutive \nperiods, is investigated in terms of the dynamics of interrelations between public, private \nand foreign operators, and the interaction of the accommodation sector with other \npolitical, social and economic factors in Vietnam during this era of transition. The paper \nconcludes by identifying factors and trends that best characterise the evolution of \nVietnam\u2019s tourism accommodation sector over the last two decades.  \n \nKey Words: Tourism accommodation, tourism development, doi moi, Vietnam tourism, \nopen door policy \n \n                                                          \n*\n E-mail: wantanee@gmail.com \n 2 \nIntroduction \n \nThe doi moi or \u201cRenovation\u201d programme of political and economic reforms was \nintroduced by the Vietnamese Congress in 1986. This policy decentralised aspects of \ngovernance and planning and streamlined the government bureaucracy. Reforms were \nenacted to promote the private sector as an economic driver, and to permit state and \nprivately-owned industries to trade directly in foreign and international markets. Doi moi \nhas been extremely successful in transforming Vietnam from a stagnant, unstable, \ncentrally planned Soviet-style economy to a dynamic and quickly growing market-\noriented economy grounded in a socialist society (Kokko, 1998, p. 2). Events such as the \nend of the US trade embargo on Vietnam in 1994 and Vietnam\u2019s 1995 entry into \nASEAN, as well as Vietnam\u2019s admission into the World Trade Organization (WTO) at \nthe beginning of 2007, indicate an increasing re-integration of Vietnam into international \ncapitalist markets. The United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) and the \nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have been involved in assisting \nVietnam in developing a tourism policy and a tourism master plan to impose some \norganisation on this still-emerging market, as well as helping to draft the country\u2019s first \never tourism law. \nBefore the open door policy doi moi, the Vietnamese government had \nmonopolised all tourism sectors. In 1987, one year after doi moi, the state issued the Law \non Foreign Investment, which encouraged foreign direct investment in Vietnam, \nespecially in the tourism industry. Parallel to the rush of foreign investment that \nfollowed, private enterprises also increased in number, leading to the end of the \n 3 \ngovernment monopoly in provision of tourism services, although the government still \nowns a large number of hotels. Under these new circumstances, state-owned enterprises \nhave had to reinvent themselves for the first time to survive in an open market where \ncompetition is fierce.  \nThese political and economic changes have increased Vietnam\u2019s accessibility and \nattractiveness in the international tourism market, causing tourists from around the world \nto rediscover Vietnam. Consequently, Vietnam\u2019s tourism industry has experienced a \nperiod of meteoric growth in recent years. The number of foreign tourists visiting the \ncountry grew from 92,500 in 1988 to 3,583,486 in 2006 (Vietnam National \nAdministration of Tourism [VNAT], 2007). According to UNDP\/WTO, Vietnam\u2019s \ntourism turnover in 1989 was about US$ 140 million, and direct employment in the \ntourism industry accounted for 8,000 jobs (Economist Intelligence Unit [EIU], 1993, p. \n63). A 2001 estimate stated the nation\u2019s earnings from tourism as US$2.6 billion (Sadi & \nHenderson, 2001, p. 70). In 2006, there were 234,000 people employed directly in \ntourism jobs in Vietnam and 510,000 whose jobs indirectly depended on tourism (John, \n2006). According to World Travel and Tourism Council and Oxford Economic \nForecasting, Vietnam\u2019s tourism sector is expected to experience the sixth-highest growth \nrate of countries in the world between 2007 and 2016 (\u201cVietnam\u2019s Tourism Grows,\u201d \n2006). Aside from this quantifiable growth, tourism in Vietnam also continues to change \nin character. New tourism niches, new types of tourism attractions and enterprises and \nnew kinds of tourists have been appearing in Vietnam since 1986. Doi moi is an ongoing \nprocess that is reflected in all aspects of the Vietnamese society, economy and politics. \n \n 4 \nPosition and Methodology \n \nThis paper presents two primary positions: (1) changes in the tourism accommodation \nsector in Vietnam since the beginning of the doi moi programme have been characterised \nand, to a certain extent, driven by the dynamic interactions between state-owned \nenterprises, foreign direct investment and domestic private operators in this sector, and \n(2) these changes are linked to the political, social and economic changes occurring in \nVietnam within this period of transition. To articulate these positions in detail, the author \nhas divided the development of Vietnam\u2019s accommodation market since the beginning of \ndoi moi in 1986 into five periods, each of which represents a distinct stage in the \ndevelopment of the two above-mentioned historical narratives (\u201cbracketed\u201d in this paper \nby the pre-1986 state preceding doi moi and the current developments and future \noutlook). \nThis research incorporates a series of interviews conducted by the lead author \nwith administrative figures in two international hotel chains, seven state owned hotels \nand three guesthouses at different locations in Vietnam. These were supplemented with \ninterviews with a senior expert in hotels from the Vietnam National Administration of \nTourism (VNAT) and a senior official of the Foreign Investment Agency, Ministry of \nPlanning and Investment (MPI). \nBecause the research aims at understanding change over a period of years, one \ncriterion for the identification of interviewees was the length of time that they had been \ncontinuously operating in the Vietnamese tourism sector. Firms, organisations and \nindividuals that have been active in Vietnam tourism from before doi moi were the most \nvaluable sources of information in this respect, because of their ability to see patterns \n 5 \nover a longer period of time, in some cases since before the beginning of doi moi. Since \nthe state had a monopoly on tourism businesses before 1986, the longest-established \nhotels and firms are by nature government-owned. Thus, mostly state-owned hotels and \ntour operators were targeted for interviews. For private and foreign actors, such as SMEs \n(Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) and FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) firms, \ninterviewees were chosen from firms that have been established since the early days of \ndoi moi and which have experienced the full history of the development of private and \nFDI enterprises in Vietnam tourism. Interviews with representatives of government \nbodies were sought in order to understand changes in tourism policy from the point of \nview of those charged with its formulation and enforcement. While these criteria were \napplied to the prioritisation of certain potential interviewees over others, it was not \nalways possible to gain access to the first-choice interviewees. Thus, a degree of \nflexibility had to be exercised in replacing filling-in for desired but inaccessible \ninterviews. \nThe author strove to verify and corroborate interview results by addressing issues \nthrough multiple lines of questioning aimed at different interviewees at different levels or \nsectors, such as the interviewing of representatives of the VNAT as well as private, state-\nowned and international operators in the accommodation sector. Interviews with \nrepresentatives of government bodies often served the purpose of verifying the findings \nobtained from other primary sources such as interviews with representatives of tourism \nbusinesses. \n \nSignificance of the study \n 6 \n \nAs a still-developing destination, Vietnam has not been the subject of much research in \nthe area of tourism. Literature on accommodation in Vietnam and tourism development \noverall is particularly scarce. Thus, this study makes a contribution to a body of tourism \nresearch that is still in its early stages by proposing a cognitive structure to articulate past, \npresent and future developments in the Vietnamese accommodation sector. The \nperiodisation laid-out in this paper contributes to the articulation of a history of tourism in \nthis country and provides a reflection on the nature of the forces and mechanisms that \nshape and direct accommodation development, which may be drawn on to inform \ndecision-making within this sector. \nA great deal of the literature that has been published to date on tourism in \nVietnam is based on secondary data. This paper integrates this literature with primary \ndata collected by the author, enriching the literature available to future researchers. \nBecause the government of Vietnam is of a different type than those of typical \ndeveloped tourism destinations, the research adds to the body of knowledge on the effects \nof regime type on tourism development patterns. Particularly, there are also opportunities \nfor comparison or transferral of knowledge and models from the Vietnamese context to \nunderstand possible or actual patterns of tourism development in other transition \neconomies, such as those of the formerly communist nations of Eastern Europe. \n \nPre-1986: Pre-Doi Moi \n \n 7 \nFrench-style accommodation and gastronomy characterised the hospitality facilities for \ntourists to pre-War Vietnam. Much of the physical infrastructure of the colonial tourism \nfacilities suffered physical damage in the American War, and the demand for luxurious \naccommodation was much less after the War than in the colonial era, due to the low \nbuying power of the domestic tour groups and Eastern European visitors who accounted \nfor the majority of Vietnam\u2019s tourists after the reunification. Consequently, between 1975 \nand 1988, the significance of French accommodation and cuisine declined to a great \nextent (EIU, 1993, p. 62). The old resorts built during the French era had been aimed \nprimarily at weekend breaks or very short stays, inspired by middle-class European \nmodels. These hotels were not up to the standards of the international tourists who once \nagain began coming to Vietnam after 1986, since most of these hotels lacked any \nrecreational or entertainment facilities beyond beds and food service (United Nations \nDevelopment Programme [UNDP], 1991, p. 22), and some had been converted to other \nuses or had fallen into disrepair.  \n \nPeriod 1: 1986-early 1990: Period of state dominance and the first joint ventures \n \nDuring the communist era until doi moi, the government was the sole owner of \naccommodation in Vietnam. During the early years of doi moi, most hotels still belonged \nto the State and were of a generally low standard. At the beginning of this period, most \ntourists to Vietnam still came from countries of the communist economic bloc \nCOMECON (Council for Mutual Economic Assistance) and did not demand a high \nstandard of accommodation, nor could most of them have afforded international standard \nhotel prices. Most accommodation facilities in Vietnam were traditionally state-owned, \n 8 \nwith the VNAT, provincial and city tourism enterprises and various ministries and state \nagencies running the majority of hotels (Vietnam National Administration of Tourism \n[VNAT], 2001, p. 40). Because foreign joint ventures were not yet operating in Vietnam, \nthe state-owned hotels were not experiencing any competition within the accommodation \nmarket. \nThe UNDP\/WTO calculated Vietnam\u2019s 1989 tourism earnings as around US$ 140 \nmillion, and estimated that 8,000 people were directly employed in the tourism industry \n(EIU, 1993, p. 63). The Vietnamese government decreed 1990 as \u201cVisit Vietnam Year\u201d, \nin hopes of encouraging tourism to the country. However, this programme was deemed \nlargely a failure by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), which cited a shortage of hotel \nrooms, suitable tourist facilities, services and airline seats as contributing factors (1993, \np. 63). At the outset of the 1990s, there was very little accommodation of international \nstandard in Vietnam (VNAT, 2001, p. 39). In 1990, the UNDP and WTO document \ncounted only 1,565 international standard rooms in the whole country (UNDP, 1991, p. \n20). It became evident that the quality and quantity of Vietnam\u2019s tourism infrastructure \nand amenities were not sufficient to meet the expectations of the international tourism \nmarket. Without the knowledge and money needed to bring about a transformation of the \ncountry\u2019s tourism industry, the Vietnamese government was compelled to end its \nmonopoly on tourism. With raised awareness of the importance of adequate infrastructure \nto tourism development, the Vietnamese government began measures to encourage joint \nventures in tourism to lure foreign firms to invest in development in Vietnam (EIU, 1993, \np. 63). \n 9 \nThe 200-room Saigon Floating Hotel was a pioneering FDI-funded joint-venture \nhotel in Vietnam. It was built in Australia and towed across the ocean to Ho Chi Minh \nCity. It opened in December 1989 and was operated by Southern Pacific Hotels as a joint \nventure between Australian and Filipino partners and the Vietnamese Overseas Finance \nand Trade Corporation (OCFC) (Abbott & Abbott, 1996, p. 193; Travel Business \nAnalyst, 1992, p. 19), becoming the only five-star international standard hotel in the city. \nThe Floating Hotel was the only accommodation establishment in Ho Chi Minh City \noffering features such as an international booking service, international direct dial phone \nlines, international booking, a business centre and credit card facilities. By 1990, seventy-\nfive percent of the Floating Hotel\u2019s rooms were rented long-term to expatriates (EIU, \n1993, p. 68; Saigontourist, 1990, p. 31). \n \nPeriod 2: 1990-1994: Rise of joint venture hotels \n \nBeginning in 1990, there was significant growth in the accommodation sector, spurred by \nthe Vietnamese government\u2019s relinquishment of its monopoly and the opening-up of the \nmarket to foreign investment. State enterprises no longer held a monopoly and private \nand foreign investors began to become involved. Because of the increasing number of \nforeign business travellers to Vietnam, at the beginning of 1990 there was a shortage of \ninternational standard hotel rooms in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi. Foreign joint venture \nhotels began to be established to fill this niche. By the end of this period, two large \ninternational hotels had been established in Hanoi and five in Ho Chi Minh City. In this \nperiod, hotel room prices and occupancy rates became very high. The entry of \n 10 \ninternational standard hotels into the market brought competitors to state-owned \naccommodation for the first time, requiring them to re-evaluate and revise their \nbusinesses to remain competitive. During these years, many state-owned hotels \nunderwent renovation, sanitation and expansion. \nThe accommodation shortage at the beginning of the 1990s made it possible for \nfive-star joint venture hotels such as the Century Saigon to charge US$ 200 per night, \nwhile a visitor could pay US$ 300 for a room at the Saigon Floating Hotel. Even with \nthese high prices, the room occupancy rate was very high and potential visitors to \nVietnam were warned to make prior reservations (Antoine, 1992; \u201cForeign Investors,\u201d \n1991, p. 19). The Floating Hotel\u2019s General Manager at the time reported occupancy rates \nbetween 80 and 100 percent consistently for two years (McKinnon, 1993, p. 17). The \nPullman Metropole Hotel in Hanoi, reopened in 1992, reported an average occupancy \nrate of 90 percent (Antoine, 1992) during the same period.  \nOther hotel openings followed. In 1992, the joint venture Century Saigon Hotel \nopened with an Average Room Rate (ARR) of US$ 108 (similar to the Floating Hotel\u2019s \nARR of US$ 110) and had an occupancy rate of 75 percent in its first half-year of \noperation. These rates exceeded those of state-owned accommodation providers such as \nthe Rex Hotel (US$ 60 per night), the Continental (US$ 85), the Saigon Star (US$ 78), \nthe Norfolk (US$ 75) and the Chains First Hotel (US$ 43) (Militante, 1993). The Century \nSaigon hotel aimed at an ARR of US$ 123 for 1993 and US$ 138 for 1994 (ibid.) and the \nlow supply of four and five-star hotels in Vietnam in the early 1990s enabled such hotels \nto charge US$ 150 a night by 1993 (Michael, 1993). \n 11 \nA joint venture between a state-owned enterprise and a Hong Kong investor \nopened the 14-storey, 552-room New World Saigon Hotel in 1994. The hotel had what \nwere possibly the first escalators in Saigon. Because the project was self-financed, it \navoided the ban on syndicated loans imposed by the US trade embargo. The Hong Kong \ninvestor New World contributed three-quarters of the US$ 62.5 million budget, with \nSaigontourist Holding Company making up the remainder (Michael, 1993). \nThe domestic private accommodation market in Vietnam also grew quickly \nduring over these years, enabled by access to small plots of land and alternative funding \nsources. By 1992, nearly half of the 2,756 hotels in Vietnam were private enterprises \n(EIU, 1993, p. 63). These hotels were almost exclusively small-scale, low budget \noperations, catering primarily to the \u201cbackpacker\u201d independent traveller niche, and did \nnot compete directly with larger state-owned of foreign-owned hotels. \nA grading system for hotels was among the legal regulations for tourism \naccommodation passed in 1992, but the \u2018star\u2019 system of hotel classification was not put \ninto actual practice by the VNAT until 1994 according to a government official. The \nsystem applies only to hotels catering to foreign tourists and is based on a ranking of one \nto five stars. Although hotels are required to be graded, a lack of VNAT staff is hindering \nthe full implementation of the system (VNAT, 2001, p. 41). \nIn 1993 government plans to increase the number of international standard rooms \nin Vietnam from 4,000 to 9,000 by the end of 1995 were deemed insufficient to meet the \nrequirements of the expected tourism growth in that time, as the number of tourists by \n1994 had already reached a million, double the number forecast by the government (Mok \n& Lam, 1996, p. 32). The Vietnamese Investment Review, quoted in McDowell, reported \n 12 \nthat a number of Vietnamese tour agencies would sell package tours during these years \nwithout even having the necessary hotel rooms available (McDowell, 1994). However, \nthese high occupancy rates apparently applied only to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, as \nlack of proper tourism planning allowed over-development of accommodation provisions \nin some areas at the same time that Vietnam\u2019s two biggest cities were experiencing a \nsevere shortage. Haiphong, for example, reported low occupancy rates during the same \nperiod (EIU, 1993, p. 68) and Theuns (1997, p. 308) has written that parts of the country \naway from Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City had average occupancy rates of about 20-50 \npercent. \nSince the Vietnamese government and domestic sector did not possess the \nexpertise or the finances to drive development in the hospitality sector unassisted, the \nState Committee for Cooperation and Investment (SCCI) approved many foreign \ninvestment proposals for hotel development (EIU, 1993, p. 63). According to a Senior \nOfficial of the Foreign Investment Agency (FIA) of the Ministry of Planning and \nInvestment (MPI), established foreign accommodation chains brought in their own loyal \ncustomers, thus attracting foreign exchange income into the country. Priority was given \nthe refurbishment of existing hotels to bring them up to international standards. In terms \nof funds invested, hotel renovations were among the largest joint venture projects \n(Theuns, 1997, p. 314). \nDuring this period, hotel development accounted for between 57.5 and 99.4 \npercent of the yearly total FDI in tourism (Erramilli, Luu, Gilbert, & Hooi, 1997, p. 280). \nTogether with oil\/gas and industry, hotel development was one of three major investment \n 13 \nareas that cumulatively accounted for up to 83 percent of total foreign investment in 1992 \n(EIU, 1993, p. 63). \n \nPeriod 3: 1995-1996: reaction of state hotels \n \nThe increasing number of joint venture hotels posed a challenge for existing state-owned \nhotels, which had to adjust to competitors in the market that they had monopolised before \ndoi moi. State-owned hotels also had to come to terms with the needs and demands of the \nWestern tourists who began to make up an increasing proportion of their customer base. \nFor example, the Dan Chu Hotel in Ho Chi Minh City receives around 75 percent foreign \nguests and 25 percent domestic. Many of these hotels previously catered to guests from \nEastern bloc countries: a market with lower expectations but a market that had dwindled \nfollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union. Many older urban hotels replaced their \nVietnamese names by restoring the Western-sounding names they had borne in the pre-\ncommunist era before 1975 (Travel Business Analyst, 1992 p. 26), in an attempt to \nappeal to the foreign market. \nSome hotels supplemented their reservation departments with sales or marketing \ndepartments.  Around this time, state-owned hotels began to accept credit cards. All of \nthese changes were undertaken concurrent with the withdrawal of government financial \nsupport for state-owned hotels. The Deputy General Manager of a state-owned hotel in \nHanoi related that guest-oriented thinking was a new concept to her hotel\u2019s management \nin 1993. Before that, an undersupply of hotel rooms had virtually assured hotels of \nsufficient occupancy, and the government could be counted on to provide subsidies. \n 14 \nIncreasing competition and the disappearance of government support were among the \nfactors that inspired the hotel to begin to accept credit cards in 1995 (Respondent, Hotel \nA, personal communication, June 30, 2004).  \nIn 1995, the Majestic Hotel in Ho Chi Minh City became the first state-owned \nhotel to open a sales department, as a reaction to the burgeoning success of joint-venture \ncompetitors such as the Floating Hotel and Omni Saigon Hotels. Such joint-venture \nhotels provided both an imperative and an example for the introduction of more \nprogressive management thinking by their state-owned competitors. Although in an \ninterviewed a government official denied that joint-venture hotels have had any effect on \nstate-owned hotels, the Director of Sales and Marketing of one state-owned hotel has \nopenly stated that he had learned about pricing and promotion from the hotel\u2019s joint-\nventure rivals. The discrepancy between these declarations may be indicative of the \ndegree of autonomy that has been assumed by state-owned hotels, which must deal with \nproblems of which government may not even be aware. \nAlso during these years, domestic private entrepreneurs began to do business \nserving the independent tourist \u2018backpacker\u2019 market, which was disparaged by state-\nowned operators, who did not consider independent tourists a significant market sector \nand did not see small private operators as a threat or competitor. In contrast, all of the \nseven representatives of state-owned hotels interviewed already saw joint venture hotels \nas direct threats and competitors within the market sectors to which the state \naccommodation sector aspired. \n \nPeriod 4: 1996-1999: Oversupply and falling demand \n 15 \n \nAccommodation occupancy rates in Vietnam were high in the mid-1990s. Around 1996, \nthe overall hotel occupancy rate in Hanoi was 85-90 percent (Theuns, 1997, p. 308), \nhowever, several factors contributed to a fall in occupancy during the period following \nthis peak. The government\u2019s xenophobic \u2018social evils\u2019 campaign of 1995, a lack of repeat \nvisitors, irregularity in visa regulation and enforcement and the Asian Economic Crisis of \n1998 all contributed to a drop in tourist arrivals to Vietnam during this period. Many joint \nventure hotels, begun in the boom years of the previous period, were opening at the same \ntime. By 1999, there were seven international foreign joint venture hotels in Hanoi, with \nbetween 224 and 441 rooms each. Ho Chi Minh City also had seven such hotels, with \nbetween 248 and 552 rooms. This led to an oversupply of rooms in Ho Chi Minh City \nand Hanoi and a drastic fall in prices and occupancy rates. The greatest fall in prices \ncame between 1996 and 1998. During these three years, room prices in one small private \ndomestic-owned hotel with 17 rooms fell from US$ 70 to about US$ 25 a night \n(Respondent, Hotel B, personal communication, June 27, 2004). At the Daewoo joint \nventure hotel in Hanoi, the average room price fell from US$ 120 to US$ 80 in the same \nperiod. As a result, many small private hotels went bankrupt (Biles, Lloyd, & Logan, \n1999, p. 18). Several interviewees stated that during the crisis, many state-owned hotels \nadopted pricing policies such as low\/high season price differentiation and started \nprogrammes of promotion for the first time, following the example of foreign joint \nventure hotels.  \nIn May 1997, for the first time since doi moi, there was a drop in hotel occupancy \nrates in Vietnam. Occupancy fell to 52 percent in Hanoi and 48 percent in Ho Chi Minh \n 16 \nCity (Lamb as cited in Biles, et al, 1999, p. 18). According to the Viet Nam News, \nthough, the hotel occupancy rate had actually started to decline to a low of 40-45 percent \nin state-owned hotels and 25-30 percent in private hotels from January to September \n1996 (as cited in Logan, 1997, p. 175). Another source mentions that occupancy rates in \nfour-star and five-star hotels were only 40 percent in 1997 and fell to 20 percent in 1998 \n(\u201cVietnam-Hotel Business,\u201d 1998). The Asian economic crisis, a lack of attractions in the \ncities, a low return tourist rate, complicated visa procedures and poor transport all \ncontributed to this declining trend (Logan, 1997, p. 175). \nDomestic private hotels retained their position as primary provider of \naccommodation to the \u201cbackpacker\u201d market. These hotels also remained the most \ninformal accommodation niche. A 1997 survey of twelve private hotels in Bai Chay, \nHalong Bay, Quang Ninh Province, revealed that seven of the owners were still \nemployed by state enterprises or were receiving state pensions. Nine of the hotels also \nserved as the owner\u2019s family\u2019s home but only three of the hotels provided the family\u2019s \nprimary source of income. The narrow plots of state-owned land on which the hotels are \nbuilt \u2013 often one storey at a time as funding allowed \u2013 were often acquired at below \nmarket prices by state employees, teachers, former soldiers, officials or state company \nemployees (Nicholson, 1997, p. 30). The owner of one private guest house in Sapa is also \nthe manager of the state-owned hotel across the street (DiGregorio, Pham, & Minako, \n1996, p. 5). Throughout the 1990s, however, operators in this sector remained on a \nprecarious footing, due to a lack of land titling and unclear land rights laws, encouraging \na rough-and-ready approach to business and a quest for quick profit (DiGregorio et al, p. \niv). \n 17 \nIn 1998, a policy of seasonal pricing was adopted at the Hoa Binh Hotel in Hanoi \nfor the first time. Interviewed executives at several state-owned hotels have confirmed \nthat lower room rates or special offers apply for Vietnamese guests, and that domestic \ntourists are targeted more aggressively during the international tourism low season. \n \nPeriod 5: 1999-present \n \nIn 2000, there were 55,760 international standard rooms in hotels in Vietnam compared \nto 13,055 in 1992: a major increase of over 320 percent. The growth in accommodation \nhas kept pace with the increase in tourist arrival numbers, which reached 2,428,735 in \n2003. Consequently, according to the VNAT, in 2002, the room occupancy rate still \naveraged 45 percent (Vietnam National Administration of Tourism, n.d.). In 2004, \nVietnam had 85,381 rooms (Le, 2005). In that same year, it was forecast that Vietnam \nwould have 130,000 rooms by 2010 (\u201cSummary of Vietnam,\u201d 2004).  \nVisitor numbers to Vietnam have continued to increase steadily. Hotel room \nprices have also gradually increased, but have not reached pre-1996 levels. Only one big \nnew joint venture hotel has been built in Ho Chi Minh City in this period, and none in \nHanoi. Asian regional crises such as the SARS outbreak of 2003 and the avian flu of \n2004 had temporary effects on occupancy rates. A few of the state-owned hotels \ninvestigated in this study have begun to offer various added services such as travel \nagencies and massages, often provided by private individuals or companies renting space \nin a state-owned hotel, in order to meet tourist demand. To better deal with fluctuations in \n 18 \ninternational tourism demand, many hotels are trying to attract more domestic tourists \nthrough promotion within the country or arranging of events. \nThe highest concentrations of hotel facilities in Vietnam are in Ho Chi Minh City \nand Hanoi. In 1999, there were 555 hotels in Ho Chi Minh City and 371 hotels in Hanoi \n(Government of Vietnam, 2000, p. 20). In 2002, Vietnam had a total of fourteen five-star \nhotels, six of which were in Ho Chi Minh City and another six in Hanoi (\u201cSummary of \nVietnam,\u201d 2004). \nHotel rooms in Vietnam were in oversupply from 1997 until at least the early \n2000s. Occupancy of hotels in Vietnam is still restricted in part by \u2018bottlenecks\u2019 in the \ntransport system. The General Manager of the Hilton Hanoi Opera Hotel, , blamed a \nshortage of international flights into Hanoi, and the comparatively high price of those \nincoming flights that did exist, for stagnation in demand for Hanoi\u2019s 3,000 five-star \nstandard rooms. Despite a halving of average deluxe room rates from the original target \nof US$ 135 - 150 to as low as US$ 65 per night, the occupancy rate for five-star hotels \nrose only to 60 percent (Son, 2001). \nHowever, the accommodation provisions are at present not sufficient to satisfy \ndemand at the busiest times of the year. According to a senior official of the Foreign \nInvestment Agency of MPI, Vietnam still does not have enough rooms to meet the \ndemand brought by such events as the recent ASEAN summit, which took place in Hanoi \nin September 2004. A news report issued soon after the APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic \nCooperation) CEO summit in Hanoi in November, 2006 claimed that the city experienced \na shortage of deluxe hotel rooms during the high season, meeting only 70 percent of \ndemand during the peak period (\u201cHa Noi,\u201d 2006). \n 19 \nAccording to data received from the General Statistical Office in Hanoi, the \nnumber of hotels owned by private enterprises now surpasses the number of state-owned \nhotels, though private enterprise hotels tend to be very small-scale compared to state-\nowned hotels. For example, in 2000, there were 2,846 hotels in Vietnam, of which 867 \nwere owned by state enterprises, 257 by joint ventures and 1,722 by private enterprises \n(\u201cSummary of Vietnam,\u201d 2004). Data obtained from the VNAT and General Statistical \nOffice, (GSO) shows that state enterprise ownership still prevails among hotels with star-\nrating status, but not in the hotel sector as a whole. Under-reporting of room provisions is \nalso more prevalent among private-owned accommodation. Nicholson estimated that the \nprivate sector hotel rooms in Bai Chay, Halong Bay, may have been underestimated by as \nmuch as 60 percent because of rooms that were not reported to avoid taxation (Nicholson, \n1997, p. 30). \nMany international hotel chains had opened hotels in Vietnam by 2001, and many \nof the hotels in Vietnam\u2019s larger cities were operated by Vietnamese\/foreign joint \nventures (VNAT, 2001, p. 41). The scale and budget of tourism accommodation projects \nin Vietnam continues to increase. An American asset management company has applied \nfor a license for the construction of a US$ 1 billion resort and entertainment complex on \nthe island of Phu Quoc (Vietnam National Administration of Tourism [VNAT], 2006). \n \nCurrent Issues and Future Outlook \n \nThe joint-venture accommodation sector continues to expand. For instance, Accor plans \nto open four new hotels in Vietnam by 2008, in addition to the nine that it already has \n 20 \n(Strauss, 2007). Despite the growth of FDI in Vietnam\u2019s accommodation sector, most \nnew hotels developed in Vietnam are state-owned, often as joint ventures with foreign \ninvestors (VNAT, 2001, p. 45). In the majority of cases, especially in cities, the hotels are \nowned by, and provide a major source of income for, city and provincial tourism bodies. \n(Travel Business Analyst, 1992, p. 13). Sixty percent of the one- to five-star grade hotels \nand 65 percent of all hotel rooms in Vietnam belonged to SOEs (State-Owned \nEnterprises) in 2001. The owning state bodies ranged from national ministries to district \nand commune-level agencies. The predominance of state ownership of hotels has been \nseen as a mechanism of built-in government regulation in the accommodation industry \n(VNAT, 2001, p. 109, 159). However, the diffusion of control over different levels and \nbodies of government mitigates the effectiveness and homogeneity of policies that was \npossible within the former centrally controlled market. \nState-owned accommodation providers had a strategic advantage over the private \noperators just entering the Vietnamese market in the post-doi moi period by virtue of their \npossession of a number of well-located, established hotels in historic buildings in the \nurban centres of Vietnam. However, the competition of foreign joint venture hotels has \ninspired state hotels to improve their profitability, standards of service and facilities. \nMany state-owned hotels have been renovated or have moved into newly-built buildings \nto keep abreast of the demand of the international market. The cessation of direct \ngovernment support compels these accommodation providers to operate differently than \nin pre-doi moi years, heralding a change in their management and service culture. \nAs mentioned, some state hotels are adding amenities such as massage and travel \nservices, to supplement the room-only offering of pre-doi moi. Small private operators \n 21 \nwill commonly offer services and run galleries, clubs and other businesses inside state-\nowned hotels, paying rent to the hotel and thereby supplementing its income \n(Respondent, Hotel C, personal communication, June 24, 2004). \nA continuation of dual private and public ownership has been endorsed in the \n\u2018Revised National Tourism Plan for Vietnam 2001-2010, Draft Report\u2019, which also calls \nfor a careful thinking-through of privatisation, including the establishment of requisite \nregulatory systems and bodies. However, the same report also mentions other modes of \nwholly-private, wholly-state or public\/private ownership, including the \u2018equitization\u2019 of \nstate enterprises by sale of shares, the sale or transfer of some entire SOEs to private \ninterests, the liquidation of non-performing SOEs and the restructuring of remaining \ngovernment enterprises to enhance their autonomy and accountability (2001, p. 159). \nJoint-venture hotels are able to offer bonuses such as discounts at their other \nhotels, by virtue of their global connections, their years of experience and economies of \nscale. They are also better equipped to deal with international bookings and tracking-\ndown non-paying guests. Because state-owned hotels are restricted to ventures inside of \nVietnam, they cannot compete with the newcomers in these aspects (Respondent, Hotel \nA, personal communication, May 24, 2004). Thus, state-owned hotels must capitalise on \ntheir own natural advantages. The low prices offered by state-owned hotels offset their \nlower standards of facilities and service and constitute an advantage against the \ncompetition (Respondent, Hotel D, personal communication, May 30, 2004). This price \ndifference is in part due to lower operating budgets because of lower provision of \nfacilities and service, as well as the hiring of local staff rather than foreigners. Foreign \ntraining manuals and videos are used in at least one state-owned hotel, to indoctrinate \n 22 \nstaff in international service standards (Respondent, Hotel E, personal communication, \nMay 11, 2004). In recognition of the importance of environmental issues when marketing \nto Western guests, the Rex Hotel spent two years preparing for the environmental \ncertificate ISO14001, which it received in 2004 (Respondent, Rex Hotel, personal \ncommunication, May 13, 2004).  The Continental Hotel became the second hotel in \nVietnam to receive the ISO 14001 environmental certificate in that same year \n(\u201cContinental Hotel,\u201d n.d.) and the Majestic Hotel has also started working towards this \ncertification. \nOlder state-owned hotels are undergoing renovations and improvements to keep \nup with the international market. The 4-star Rex Hotel in Ho Chi Minh City is completing \na new 70-room 5-star hotel, with a 1000-person conference hall, parking and pool \n(Respondent, Rex Hotel, personal communication, May 13, 2004). The municipal \nPeople\u2019s Committee, which has provided a 3,000 square meter site is investing up to \nVND 300 billion (US$ 19.4 million) for construction of the new building (Son, 2003). \nInner-city state-run hotels may be frustrated in their ambitions to upgrade due to site \nconstraints. The Continental Hotel in the centre of Ho Chi Minh City has no space to \nprovide new facilities such as parking or a swimming pool, and the hotel\u2019s large street-\nside windows are kept closed to keep out noise and pollution, but guests still complain. \nSome outdated state-owned hotels in Hanoi are slated to be demolished to make way for \nnew four-to-five-star accommodation (Respondent, Hotel C, personal communication, \nJune 24, 2004).  \n \nConclusion \n \n 23 \nThe opening of Vietnam\u2019s tourism accommodation market to foreign direct investment \nand domestic private entrepreneurs has brought about competition, consolidation and \ndifferentiation in the accommodation sector that was absent under the previous state \nmonopoly. A more intensively-trained workforce and an orientation towards customer-\nresponsiveness are required to serve this more differentiated and discerning market, and \nVietnam\u2019s accommodation providers are increasingly concerned with meeting \ninternational standards. \nVietnam\u2019s current political transition has influenced the accommodation sector in \na number of ways. The open door policy is to a large extent the primary cause of \nVietnam\u2019s increasing attractiveness as a leisure and business destination in recent years, \nand also the resulting rapid growth in numbers of tourists in Vietnam. Parallel to this \nquantitatively-measurable growth, qualitatively different types of tourists have begun to \nenter the country during this time. The small groups of political and industrial tourists \nfrom COMECON countries during the pre-doi moi years have been replaced by a much \nwider variety of visitors, in terms of their origins, travelling budgets and expectations.  \nThe Vietnamese government\u2019s eagerness to enter into the global community of \nnations so long denied it is evinced by Vietnam\u2019s recent admission to ASEAN, and WTO \naspirations. The accommodation sector is directly affected by investment law reforms and \nother legislation passed in order to meet the requirements of entry into these \norganisations. The involvement of organisations like WTO and the UNDP in Vietnam \nintroduces a global perspective to tourism planning, inspiring the drafting of the \ncountry\u2019s first Tourism Law (2006). \n 24 \nMany aspects of the development of tourism businesses in Vietnam in the doi moi \nperiod can be seen as results of the interactions between state-owned, domestic private \nand foreign joint venture operators in the industry since the latter two became active in \nVietnam in the late 1980s. The government relinquished its monopoly on tourism \nenterprises in order to encourage the growth of a free market within which state-owned \nfirms competed alongside private sector businesses. Foreign joint ventures have brought \ninternational standards to Vietnamese tourism and thereby brought new impetus for \nimprovement to domestic and state businesses. Through their small scale, flexibility and \nresourcefulness, private entrepreneurs are able to find and fill niches not served by the \nlarger state and FDI firms, and also play a role in incubating forms of tourism businesses \nthat may be later taken up by government or foreign operators. All three types of firms \nare affected by factors such as government regulation, the quality of available human \nresources and infrastructure. State, foreign and domestic private tourism enterprises all \nplay roles in influencing and directing changes in these and other factors in Vietnamese \nsociety that influence their operating environment. \n 25 \nReferences \n \nAbbott, J., & Abbott, S.
