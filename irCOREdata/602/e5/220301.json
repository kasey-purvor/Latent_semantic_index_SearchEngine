The 2007 Bali Road Map1 cites technology development and diffusion as\nstrategic objectives, which has triggered a debate about appropriate policies.\nThis debate is complicated by a number of factors. In particular, environmentally friendly\ntechnologies have been developed primarily in industrialized countries but are urgently\nrequired to mitigate GHG emissions in fast-growing emerging economies. Ensuring the\nglobal diffusion of these technologies thus entails considerable policy and economic chal-\nlenges because developing countries are reluctant to bear all the financial costs associated\nwith their adoption, while firms in industrialized countries are reluctant to give away strategic\nintellectual assets. The role of intellectual property rights (IPR) is particularly controversial.\nDeveloping countries2 have argued for the creation of a different IPR regime for climate-\n*Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, London School of Economics and\nPolitical Science.; e-mail: A.Dechezlepretre@lse.ac.uk.\nyCERNA, Mines ParisTech, 60, Boulevard Saint Michel, 75272 Paris Cedex 06, France; e-mail: glachant@\nmines-paristech.fr; meniere@cerna.ensmp.fr\nzEmpirical Policy Analysis Unit, OECD Environmental Directorate; e-mail: nick.johnstone@oecd.org; ivan.\nhascic@oecd.org\n1Participants at the 2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali developed a roadmap, known as\nthe Bali Road Map, for negotiating a new climate agreement by the end of 2009.\n2The countries referred to as \u2018\u2018developing countries\u2019\u2019 are in fact quite heterogeneous.

There is neither a clear and widely accepted definition of what constitutes a\n\u2018\u2018climate change\u2013mitigation technology\u2019\u2019 nor a widespread understanding of how such tech-\nnologies are diffused globally.\nThis article, which is part of a two-article symposium on Technology Transfer and Climate\nPolicy, seeks to inform the debate with factual evidence on the geographic distribution and\nglobal diffusion of climate-mitigation inventions.4 Using data from the European Patent\nOffice (EPO) Worldwide Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT), we examine patented inven-\ntions in thirteen technology areas with significant global GHG emission abatement potential\nand analyze their international transfer between 1978 and 2005. We use counts of patent\napplications to measure technological innovation in the different areas.5 Although patents\ndo not provide a measure of all innovation, they are a good proxy for innovative activity\nand allow us to make cross-country comparisons.\nMost previous studies have used data from a small number of patent offices (usually one). The\ndata and analysis presented here gowell beyond these studies because the PATSTAT data contain\npatentsfromeighty-fournationalandinternationalpatentoffices, includingpatentsfiledindevel-\noping countries. This allows us to conduct a global analysis of innovative activity and to gain\ninsights about international technology transfer. Moreover, we have developed a methodology\nthat makes it possible to construct indicators that can be used to make absolute cross-country\ncomparisons.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses patent data to quantitatively\ndescribe the geographic distribution and temporal trend of invention and diffusion of climate\nchange\u2013mitigation technologies at the global level. Lanjouw and Mody (1996), which focuses\non patents for environmentally-responsive technology in Japan, Europe, the United States,\nand fourteen developing countries, is the study most closely related to our work. These\nauthors identify the leaders in environmental patenting and find that significant transfers\nto developing countries occur. However, our analysis focuses more specifically on cli-\nmate-change mitigation, uses more recent data, and covers more countries.\nWe seek to address the following keyquestions. Inwhich countries does climate-friendly inno-\nvation takeplace?What is the specificcontributionof innovators located in emerging economies?\nTo what extent is technology being transferred to developing countries? Is climate-mitigation\ninnovation different from other technology areas? Whenever possible, we also try to assess the\nimpact of climate and environmental policies on invention and technology diffusion.\nThe remainder of this article is organized as follows. The next section introduces key\nconcepts and discusses the use of patents as indicators of technological innovation and tech-\nnology transfer. This is followed by a description of our dataset and a discussion of data issues.\n3See Maskus (2010) for a discussion.\n4The other article, Popp (2011), reviews the economics literature concerning the transfer of environmentally\nfriendly technologies and discusses the implications for climate policy, focusing in particular on the Clean\nDevelopment Mechanism.\n5Throughout the article, the terms innovation and invention are used interchangeably.\n110 Dechezlepre\u02c6tre et al.\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/reep.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nWe present our analytical results in the next two sections. We first use the data to examine\nglobal innovative activity in the thirteen climate-mitigation fields and across countries\nbetween 1978 and 2005. We then analyze the international transfer of these inventions\nand relate our findings to the general literature on patents and technology diffusion. The\nfinal section summarizes the findings and presents some conclusions.\nPatents as Indicators of Innovation and Technology Transfer\nThere are a number of ways to measure technological innovation (see Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development [OECD] 2008a). Research and development\n(R&D) expenditures or the number of scientific personnel in different sectors are the most\ncommonly used measures. Although such indicators reflect important elements of the inno-\nvation system, they have a number of disadvantages. For example, data on private R&D expen-\nditures are generally incomplete and available only at an aggregate level. Moreover, these data\nmeasure inputs to the innovation process, whereas an \u2018\u2018output\u2019\u2019 measure is generally preferable.\nPatent data have several advantages over R&D expenditures and numbers of scientific\npersonnel. First, patent data focus on outputs of the innovation process (Griliches 1990)\nand provide a wealth of information on both the nature of the invention and the applicant.\nMore importantly, patent data can be disaggregated into specific technological areas. Finally,\npatent data provide information about not only the countries where these new technologies\nare developed but also where they are used.6\nIn recent years, an increasing number of studies have used patent data to analyze inno-\nvation and international technology diffusion, particularly in the environmental field. These\nstudies have usually relied on patent data from OECD countries, especially the United States.\nFor example, Popp (2006) uses patent data from Japan, the United States, and Germany to\nexamine the invention and diffusion of air pollution control devices for coal-fired power\nplants. Johnstone, Has\u02c7c\u02c7ic\u02c7, and Popp (2010) analyze the effects of policy and market factors\non the development of renewable energy technologies in OECD member countries.\nThe Patent System\nBefore describing the indicators used in this and other studies, we briefly review how the\npatent system works. Consider a simplified innovation process. In the first stage, an inventor\nfrom a particular country discovers a new technology. He then decides where to market his\ninvention and how to protect the intellectual property associated with the invention. A patent\nin country i grants him the exclusive right to commercially exploit the invention in that coun-\ntry. Accordingly, he will patent his invention in country i if he plans to market it there. The set\nof patents related to the same invention is called a patent family. The vast majority of families\ninclude only one country (often the home country of the inventor, particularly for large coun-\ntries). When a patent is filed in several countries, the first filing date worldwide is called the\npriority date.7\n6It is these unique features of patent data that make our study climate-mitigation technologies possible.\n7Accordingly, the first patent is called the priority application and the first patent office is referred to as the\npriority office.\nInvention and Transfer of Climate Change\u2013Mitigation Technologies 111\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/reep.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nPatent Indicators and Their Limitations\nIn this study, patents are sorted by priority year. We use the number of families as an indicator\nof the number of inventions. The number of technologies invented in country A and patented\nin country B is used as an indicator of the number of inventions transferred from country A to\ncountry B. This approach has also been used by Lanjouw and Mody (1996) and Eaton and\nKortum (1999). Other studies have used a slightly different indicator based on patent citations\n(e.g., see Jaffe, Trajtenberg, and Henderson 1993; Peri 2005; Thompson and Fox-Kean 2005).\nMore specifically, these studies count the number of citations of the patented invention from\ncountry A in subsequent patents filed in country B. This approach measures knowledge exter-\nnalities\u2014that is, knowledge that spills over to other inventors. Our indicator differs in that it\nmeasures market-driven technology transfer.\nPatent-based indicators are imperfect proxies for technological innovation and technology\ntransfer and have several limitations. First, patents are only one of the means of protecting\ninventions, along with lead time, industrial secrecy, or purposely complex specifications\n(Cohen, Nelson, and Walsh 2000; Frietsch and Schmoch 2006). In particular, some inventors\nmay prefer secrecy to prevent public disclosure of the invention imposed by patent law or to\nsave the significant fees attached to patent filing. However, there are very few examples of\neconomically significant inventions that have not been patented (Dernis, Guellec, and van\nPottelsberghe de la Potterie 2001).\nSecond, the propensity to patent differs between sectors, depending on the nature of the tech-\nnology (Cohen, Nelson, and Walsh 2000). It also depends on the risk of imitation in a country.\nAccordingly, inventions are more likely to be patented in countries with technological capabilities\nand a strict enforcement of IPR. This means that greater patenting activity could reflect either\ngreater inventive activity or a greater propensity to file patents. Ourmethodology, whichmeasures\npatenting activity in various countries using a common unit, partly controls for this problem.\nAnother limitation is that while a patent grants the exclusive right to use a technology in a\ngiven country, it does not mean that the patent owner will actually exercise this right. This\ncould significantly bias the results if applying for patent protection is free, as this might\nencourage inventors to patent widely and indiscriminately. However, patenting is costly\u2014in\nterms of both the costs of preparing the application and the administrative costs and fees\nassociated with the approval procedure.8 In addition, possessing a patent in a country\nmay not be in the inventor\u2019s interest if that country\u2019s enforcement of intellectual property\nis weak, since publication of the patent can increase the risk of imitation (see Eaton and\nKortum 1996, 1999). Finally, patent infringement litigation usually takes place in the country\nwhere the technology is commercialized (as this is where the alleged infringement occurs).\nThus, inventors are unlikely to be willing to incur the cost of patent protection in a country\nunless they expect there to be a market for the technology concerned.\nHowever, the fact remains that the value of individual patents is heterogeneous. Moreover,\nbecause many patents have very low value, the distribution is skewed, and as a consequence,\nthe absolute number of patents does not perfectly reflect the value of technological innova-\ntion. Methods have been developed to address this issue (see Lanjouw, Pakes, and Putnam\n1998), such as using weights based on the number of times a given patent is cited in\n8See Helfgott (1993) and Roland (2005) for information about the cost of applications at the EPO.\n112 Dechezlepre\u02c6tre et al.\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/reep.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nsubsequent patents. Unfortunately, our data do not allow us to implement these methods.\nInstead, in addition to presenting data on the number of inventions, we use data on interna-\ntional patent families to construct statistics for \u2018\u2018high-value inventions.\u2019\u2019\nThe Data\nThe first efforts to develop a large patent database that would be suitable for statistical analysis\nwere initiated by the OECD Directorate for Science, Technology, and Industry in cooperation\nwith other members of the OECD Patent Statistics Taskforce.9 Subsequent efforts were\ndirected toward developing a worldwide patent database. The EPO took over responsibility\nfor the development and production of the database, with the first version distributed in April\n2006. The database has since become known as the EPO PATSTAT.\nPATSTAT is unique in that it covers more than eighty patent offices and contains over sixty\nmillion patent documents. It is updated biannually. Patent documents are categorized using\nthe international patent classification (IPC) codes, developed by the World Intellectual Prop-\nerty Organization (WIPO), and some national classification systems. In addition to basic\nbibliometric and legal data, the database also includes patent descriptions (i.e., abstracts)\nand citation data for some offices.\nTechnologies and Patent Applications\nWe considered thirteen climate-mitigation technologies10: seven renewable energy technolo-\ngies (wind, solar, geothermal, marine energy, hydropower, biomass, and waste to energy),\nmethane destruction, climate-friendly cement, thermal insulation in buildings, heating, electric\nand hybrid vehicles, and energy-efficient lighting.11 Although we include a wide range of cli-\nmate-mitigation technologies, a number of important technologies have been omitted due to\ndata constraints. These include energy efficiency improvements in industry, aspects of \u2018\u2018clean\u2019\u2019\ncoal technologies, and energy storage. Nevertheless, the technologies included in our dataset\nrepresent nearly 50 percent of all GHG abatement opportunities (excluding forestry) beyond\nbusiness as usual until 2030, as identified by Enkvist, Naucle\u00b4r, and Rosander (2007).\nTo build the dataset, we extracted all patent applications filed from 1978 to 2005 in the\nthirteen climate-mitigation technology fields. Patent applications related to these fields were\nidentified using IPC codes.12 The IPC codes corresponding to the climate-mitigation\n9The other taskforce members include the EPO, the Japan Patent Office (JPO), the United States Patent and\nTrademark Office, the WIPO, the National Science Foundation, Eurostat, and the European Commission\nDirectorate-General for Research.\n10A more detailed description of the technology fields covered by the study can be found in Appendix 1.\n11We also considered a fourteenth technology, carbon capture and storage (CCS).However, the CCS technology\nis not yet included in the international patent classifications system. Thus, we have used a specific search algo-\nrithm to identify CCS patent applications. The results for CCS are presented separately in Appendix 2.\n12Some previous studies have related patent classes to industrial sectors using a concordance table matching\nIPC classes with the International Standard Industrial Classification system. This approach has two weak-\nnesses. First, if the industry of origin of a patent differs from the industry of use, then it is not clear to which\nindustrial sector a patent should be attributed. Second, the use of sectoral classifications (and commodity\nclassifications) will result in a bias toward including patent applications from sectors that produce explicitly\n\u2018\u2018environmental\u2019\u2019 goods and services rather than more integrated innovations. See OECD (2008b) for a full\ndiscussion of the relative merits of the approach adopted in the current study.\nInvention and Transfer of Climate Change\u2013Mitigation Technologies 113\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/reep.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \ntechnologies were identified in two ways. First, we searched the descriptions of the IPC codes\nonline to identify those relevant to our study.13 Second, using ESP@CENET, an online patent\nsearch engine maintained by the EPO,14 we reviewed patent titles and abstracts to identify\nrelevant keywords. The IPC codes corresponding to the patents that resulted from our search\nwere included, provided that the definition of an IPC code confirmed its relevance.15\nThe resulting dataset contains 285,770 patent applications filed in seventy-six countries. On\naverage, the climate-related patents included in our dataset represent 1 percent of the total\nnumber of patents filed annually worldwide. The number of patent applications in each tech-\nnology field is presented in the online supplementary materials for this article. The PATSTAT\nincludes the country of residence of the inventors of those technologies for which patent\nprotection is sought (independent of the country in which the applications are actually filed).\nThis information is used to measure a country\u2019s innovation performance.16\nData Issues\nTwo types of error may arise when building this type of dataset: Irrelevant patents may be\nincluded or relevant ones left out. The first error occurs if a selected IPC code covers patents\nthat are not related to climate mitigation. In order to avoid this problem, we carefully\nexamined a sample of patent titles for every IPC code considered for inclusion in the dataset\nand excluded those codes that contain patents not related to climate mitigation. This is why\nsome key technologies with carbon reduction potential were excluded from the study (e.g.,\nenergy-efficient technologies in industry, certain \u2018\u2018clean\u2019\u2019 coal technologies, energy storage).\nThe second potential error\u2014exclusion of relevant inventions\u2014is less problematic. We can\nreasonably assume that all innovation in a given field follows a similar trend. Hence, at the worst,\nour dataset can be seen as being a good proxy of innovative activity in the technology fields\nconsidered. However, because of the conservative approach we adopted when constructing\nthe data, overall innovative activity may be underestimated, and the datasets in each technology\nfield are unlikely to be equally inclusive. Therefore, estimates of the absolute volume of inno-\nvative activity may be less reliable than estimated differences in temporal trends. For this reason,\ncross-technology comparisons throughout the article are based only on trends.\nAnother data issue is that the number of patents granted for a given invention (known as\npatent breadth) varies significantly across countries, making it problematic to rely on crude\npatent counts to compare innovation activity across countries. A commonly cited example is\nJapan, where patent breadth is particularly low. To address this problem, we developed patent\nbreadth coefficients for the countries in our dataset. That is, we examined all international\npatent families in the PATSTAT and then calculated how many patents protect the same\ninvention across the countries in the dataset. Recall that each patent family corresponds\nto a particular invention. Thus, the examination of international families yields information\non the number of patents in those countries where the invention is patented. We used this\n13The IPC system can be searched at http:\/\/www.wipo.int\/tacsy\/.\n14Available at http:\/\/ep.espacenet.com\/.\n15The descriptions of the IPC codes used to build the dataset can be found in the online supplementary\nmaterials for this article. See http:\/\/www.reep.oxfordjournals.org.\n16Patents withmultiple inventors are counted fractionally. For example, if two inventor countries are involved\nin an invention, then each country is counted as one-half.\n114 Dechezlepre\u02c6tre et al.\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/reep.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \ninformation to calculate country-specific patent breadth coefficients. For example, we found\nthat, on average, seven patents filed at the JPO result in approximately five patents filed at the\nEPO. This means that one EPO patent is equivalent, on average, to 1.4 JPO patents.17 We set\nthe coefficient for applications at the EPO to unity. This means that the results presented in\nthe next section indicate the number of \u2018\u2018EPO-equivalent\u2019\u2019 inventions.18 The drawback of this\napproach is that although we use international families to calculate the patent breadth coef-\nficients, these coefficients are used to weight both international patent applications and patents\nfiled in only one country, and it is possible that the two kinds of patents have different breadth.\nFor example, a Japanese inventor who expects to file a patent both in Japan and abroad may\ndesign a \u2018\u2018broader\u2019\u2019 patent that will be readily transferable to foreign patent offices. Thus, our\nmethod for calculating the coefficients may underestimate the actual patent breadth.\nOne data issue specifically concerns patents filed in the United States, where until 2000\npublished data concerned only granted patents, while offices in other countries have consis-\ntently provided data on applications. A final data issue is that the inventor\u2019s country of\nresidence is not available for some patent applications. A more detailed description of these\ntwo issues and how we addressed them is presented in the online supplementary materials.\nInnovation Activity Worldwide\nThis section discusses the level of innovation across countries and the evolution of innovation\nover the period 1978\u20132005.\nThe Geography of Innovation\nWhere does innovation take place?19 As shown in Table 1, innovation appears to be highly concen-\ntrated: The top twelve countries account for nearly 90 percent of all inventions between 2000 and\n2005. Japan, theUnited States, andGermany are the three top inventor countries formost technol-\nogies. With 37 percent of the world\u2019s inventions, Japan\u2019s performance is particularly impressive.\nJapan ranks first in all technology fields, except formarine energy, where it is second, and accounts\nfor over 50 percent of the world\u2019s inventions in electric and hybrid, waste, and lighting.20\nThese findings are consistent with the available evidence on R&D activity. Although\ndetailed data on private R&D are not available, the data on public R&D for low-carbon\ntechnologies confirm the strong leadership of Japan, which in 2004 spent $US 220 million,\nsignificantly more than public R&D spending in the same year by the United States\n($US 70 million) and the EU1521 ($US 50 million) combined (Lazarus and Kartha 2007).\n17Note that this is a much lower ratio than others have obtained using \u2018\u2018claims\u2019\u2019 rather than patents as the unit\nof analysis.\n18The EPO-equivalent country weights (coefficients) for various patent offices are presented in Appendix 3.\n19Recall that in this study an invention corresponds to a patent family. Hence, a patent filed in several coun-\ntries is counted only once.\n20The aggregate country shares were calculated as the mean of the percentage shares for the individual tech-\nnological fields. The number of patent applications identified in each of the fields is affected by the exhaustive-\nness of the patent search strategy, which varies across the different technologies. The intention of this approach\nis to avoid aggregation across a possibly heterogeneous set of climate change\u2013mitigation technologies.\n21The EU15 consisted of those countries that were members of the European Union as of 2004: Austria,\nBelgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Por-\ntugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\nInvention and Transfer of Climate Change\u2013Mitigation Technologies 115\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/reep.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nInterestingly, the world\u2019s top three inventor countries are followed by China, South\nKorea, and Russia. These countries are important sources of innovation in fields such\nas cement (China and Russia), geothermal (China), and lighting (South Korea). Another\nemerging economy, Brazil, also ranks among the top twelve countries. However, other\nemerging economies lag far behind, with Taiwan, India, and Mexico ranked 21, 27, and\n29, respectively.\nThe Quality of Innovation\nThe rankings in Table 1 are based on patent counts, which do not take into account the quality\nof the individual inventions generated in different countries. This could pose a problem, as it\nis well established that the economic value of individual patents varies greatly. In particular, it\nhas been demonstrated that the value of a patent is correlated with the number of countries in\nwhich it is filed (Lanjouw, Pakes, and Putnam 1998; Harhoff, Scherer, and Vopel 2003). Thus,\nwe refer to those inventions with patents filed in several countries as high-value inventions.\nThe fourth column of Table 1 presents each country\u2019s share of the world\u2019s high-value\ninventions (i.e., those that are patented internationally) and thus offers a rough indicator\nof innovation quality.22 Using this indicator changes the rankings significantly. With 22.2\npercent of the world\u2019s high-value inventions, Germany becomes the leader, while Japan\nfalls to third place, with about 17 percent. Moreover, the performance of the emerging\neconomies\u2014in particular China and Russia\u2014becomes far less impressive. They innovate,\nTable 1 Top twelve inventor countries (2000\u20132005)\nCountry Rank\nAverage %\nof world\ninventions\nAverage %\nof world\u2019s\nhigh-value\ninventions\nCountry\u2019s top three\ntechnology fields\n(decreasing order)\nJapan 1 37.1 17.4 (2) All technologies\nUnited States 2 11.8 13.1 (3) Biomass, insulation, solar\nGermanyy 3 10.0 22.2 (1) Wind, solar, geothermal\nChina 4 8.1 2.3 (10) Cement, geothermal, solar\nSouth Korea 5 6.4 4.4 (6) Lighting, heating, waste\nRussia 6 2.8 0.3 (26) Cement, hydro, wind\nAustralia 7 2.5 0.9 (19) Marine, insulation, hydro\nFrancey 8 2.5 5.8 (4) Cement, electric and hybrid,\ninsulation\nUnited Kingdomy 9 2.0 5.2 (5) Marine, hydro, wind\nCanada 10 1.7 3.3 (8) Hydro, biomass, wind\nBrazil 11 1.2 0.2 (31) Biomass, hydro, marine\nThe Netherlandsy 12 1.1 2.1 (12) Lighting, geothermal, marine\nTotal \u2014 87.2 77.2\nSource: Authors\u0001 calculations, based on PATSTAT data.\naTogether, the twenty-seven countries of the European Union (EU27) represent 24% of the world\u2019s inventions.\nbHigh-value inventions are defined as inventions that have been patented in at least two countries.\n22Patent citations are used extensively in the existing literature as a measure of patent quality (see Popp 2002).\nUnfortunately, there is no suitable source of citation data that can be used in conjunction with PATSTAT for\nthe wide cross-section of countries in our study.\n116 Dechezlepre\u02c6tre et al.\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/reep.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nbut their inventions are of relatively minor economic value.23 This is consistent with previous\nfindings by Lanjouw and Mody (1996).\nThe Evolution of Climate-mitigation Innovation\nFigure 1 presents the evolution of climate-mitigation innovationworldwide since 1978. Because\nthe growth of innovation in environmental technologies could reflect a general growth of inno-\nvation in all technologies (including nonenvironmental ones), Figure 1 indicates climate-mit-\nigation inventions as a share of inventions in all technology areas. The evolution of the price of\noil over the same time period is also presented, since the incentives for innovation related to\nclimate-change mitigation are likely to be influenced by energy prices.\nOil Prices and Innovation\nFigure 1 appears to indicate that trends in climate-mitigation innovation follow oil price\ntrends. However, a close examination of the data and the figure reveals two distinct time\nperiods. Until 1990, innovation and oil prices closely mirror each other: In particular, the\n1980 peak in innovation coincides with the second oil price shock. After 1980, innovation\nand oil prices both decline and then stagnate until 1990. It may be surprising that innovators\nrespond so quickly to changes in energy prices, but this apparently rapid response has been\nwell documented in previous research (e.g., Newell, Jaffe, and Stavins 1999; Popp 2002). One\nexplanation for this phenomenon is that many patents cover inventions that have already\nbeen developed (and are \u2018\u2018on the shelf \u2019\u2019) but are not yet profitable. The new, more profitable\nmarket conditions simply make it worthwhile to legally protect them.\nThe second distinct time period starts in 1990 and is characterized by an apparent decou-\npling of innovation and oil prices.24 While innovation steadily increases during the 1990s, oil\nprices remain relatively stable until 2003. Innovation rises sharply after 2000, at an average\nFigure 1 Climate-mitigation innovation and oil prices.\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations, based on PATSTAT data, and BP Statistical Review of World Energy June 2009.\n23This also suggests that emerging economies do not export many inventions. We discuss diffusion issues in\nthe next section.\n24While the correlation coefficient between innovation and oil prices is 0.87 from 1978 to 1990, it is only 0.61\nafter 1990.\nInvention and Transfer of Climate Change\u2013Mitigation Technologies 117\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/reep.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nannual growth rate of 9 percent between 2000 and 2005. This suggests that environmental\npolicies and climate policies have had a significant impact on climate-mitigation innovation\nsince the beginning of the 1990s. The post-2000 acceleration could be interpreted as the inno-\nvators\u0001 response to the signing of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 and the subsequent implemen-\ntation of climate policies in ratifying countries.\nPolicy Impacts\nIt is difficult to draw firm conclusions about the role of policy drivers after 1990 based solely\non aggregate statistics. To further assess the role of policy drivers, Table 2 presents the annual\ngrowth rate of innovation for different climate change\u2013mitigation technologies in two time\nperiods: before and after the acceleration in the pace of innovation observed around 2000. We\nhave aggregated renewable energy technologies, as we assume they are driven by the same\npolicy regimes.\nRecall that there has been an increasing trend in innovation that accelerates in 2000. This\ntrend is driven by the subset of technologies in the top part of the table: lighting, renewable\nenergy, heating, and cement. The bottom part of the table identifies four technologies\u2014elec-\ntric and hybrid, methane, waste, and insulation\u2014which do not follow the general trend, as\nthe growth in innovation concerning these technologies occurs mainly before 2000 (i.e.,\nbefore the implementation of significant climate policies in certain Kyoto Protocol Annex\nI countries25). The growth in innovation before 2000 is likely a consequence of other, earlier\nenvironmental policies. For instance, at the beginning of the 1990s, the European Union and\nJapan implemented new waste policies, which reinforced regulatory standards for waste dis-\nposal. As a result, many new incinerators replaced those that were obsolete and many landfills\nwere retrofitted. This probably explains the surge of innovation in the 1990s in technologies to\nproduce heat from waste or to collect methane. Similarly, in 1991, Japan\u2019s Ministry of Econ-\nomy, Trade, and Industry issued an aggressive market expansion plan for electric and\nhybrid vehicles, which was further reinforced in 1997 (Ahman 2006). In California, the\nZero-Emission Vehicle (\u2018\u2018ZEV\u2019\u2019) Mandate was passed in 1991, with the objective of increasing\nTable 2 Average annual growth rates of innovation for different technologies\nTechnology 1990\u20131999 (%) 2000\u20132005 (%)\nLighting 7.6 15.9\nRenewable energy 1.8 8.0\nHeating 1.0 7.7\nCement \u00011.3 5.2\nElectric and hybrid 13.9 7.8\nMethane 4.0 1.7\nWaste 13.8 \u00017.3\nInsulation 6.4 \u00011.0\nSource: Authors\u0001 calculations, based on PATSTAT data.\n25Industrialized countries and economies in transition are listed in Annex I of the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change. Annex I countries that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol (to this date, all\nAnnex I countries except the United States) have committed to reducing their GHG emissions.\n118 Dechezlepre\u02c6tre et al.\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/reep.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nthe percentage of ZEVs sold in California. These policies help explain the strong growth in\nelectric and hybrid vehicle innovation observed in the 1990s.\nCountry-specific Trends and Policies\nAn examination of individual countries also provides some interesting insights about the evo-\nlution of climate-mitigation technological innovation and the role of public policy. Figure 2\npresents the evolution of climate-mitigation inventions in Annex I countries that have ratified\nthe Kyoto Protocol, the United States, and China. The differences across countries are striking:\nWhile climate-mitigation technological innovation has steadily increased since the beginning of\nthe 1990s in countries that have committed themselves to carbon emission reductions, rates of\ninnovation in the United States have remained relatively stable since the late 1980s. Climate-\nmitigation innovation trends in the United States seem to more closely follow oil prices, sug-\ngesting that environmental and climate policies have had a limited impact.\nChina also offers a very interesting case. Climate-mitigation innovation decreases until\nthe mid-1990s, suggesting that during that time period priority was not given to climate-\nmitigation innovation. Climate-mitigation innovation begins to increase around the year\n2000, which may reflect the implementation of domestic policies to address the country\u2019s\nworsening environmental problems. In particular, in 1998 the Ninth National People\u2019s Con-\ngress implemented an important reform of government administration, which included\nupgrading the State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) to ministerial status.\nHowever, it is also possible that the increase in climate-mitigation innovation in China\nsince 2000 has been a response to environmental and climate policies in Annex I countries.\nConsider, for example, the case of solar photovoltaic (PV) technology. China is now the\nindustry leader in this area, with 27 percent of the world\u2019s production of cells and modules\nin 2007 (Ja\u00a8ger-Waldau 2008). This production is exported almost entirely to industrialized\nFigure 2 Climate-mitigation innovation (as a share of total innovation) in Kyoto-ratifying countries, United\nStates, and China.\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations, based on PATSTAT data.\nNote: Chinese patent data not available before 1985.\nInvention and Transfer of Climate Change\u2013Mitigation Technologies 119\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/reep.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \ncountries (e.g., Germany, Japan, and Spain) where various policies (such as feed-in tariffs, tax\nrebates, or investment subsidies) have boosted the demand for solar energy technologies.\nA few other studies provide evidence that environmental regulation promotes innovation\nboth domestically and abroad. For example, Lanjouw and Mody (1996) find evidence\nthat strict U.S. regulations on vehicle emissions spurred innovation in Japan and Germany\nand that inventors in these countries responded more than inventors in the United States.\nPopp, Hafner, and Johnstone (2007) find that inventors of chlorine-free technology for\nthe pulp and paper industry respond to both domestic and foreign environmental regulatory\npressures.\nInternational Technology Transfer\nThis section reviews evidence concerning how technologies are diffused between countries\nand discusses trends in the international diffusion of climate-mitigation technologies.\nTechnology Diffusion Channels\nBefore presenting statistics on the diffusion of climate-mitigation technologies, we briefly\nreview how technology moves from one country to another. This is a central concept in\nthe more general literature on the economics of technology diffusion, which identifies three\nchannels of diffusion (see Keller 2004 for a good survey).\nThe first channel for diffusing technology is trade in goods. The idea that international\ntrade is a significant channel for knowledge flows and R&D spillovers was first developed\nby Rivera-Batiz and Romer (1991). In their model, foreign R&D creates new intermediate\ngoods with embodied technology that the home country can access through imports. There is\nempirical evidence that the importation of capital goods, such as machines and equipment,\nimproves productivity. For example, Coe, Helpman, and Hoffmaister (1997) find that the\nshare of machinery and equipment imports in Gross Domestic Product has a positive effect\non the total factor productivity of developing countries. In their descriptive study, Lanjouw\nand Mody (1996) show that imported equipment is a major source of environmental tech-\nnology for some countries.\nThe second channel of international technology diffusion is foreign direct investment\n(FDI). Several studies find evidence that multinational enterprises transfer firm-specific tech-\nnology to their foreign affiliates (e.g., Lee and Mansfield 1996; Branstetter, Fisman, and Foley\n2006). International companies might also generate local spillovers through labor turnover if\nlocal employees of the subsidiary move to domestic firms (see Fosfuri, Motta, and R\u00f8nde\n2001). Local firms may also increase their productivity by observing nearby foreign firms\nor becoming their suppliers or customers (see, e.g., Ivarsson and Alvstam 2005; Girma, Gong,\nand Gorg 2009). Overall, the literature finds strong evidence that FDI is an important channel\nfor technology diffusion.\nThe third channel of technology diffusion\u2014and the most direct\u2014is licensing. That is, a\nfirm may license its technology to a company abroad that uses it to upgrade its own pro-\nduction. Data on royalty payments have been used mostly to analyze the impact of stricter\npatent protection on technology transfer (Smith 2001; Yang and Maskus 2001; Branstetter,\nFisman, and Foley 2006).\n120 Dechezlepre\u02c6tre et al.\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/reep.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nEmpirical Evidence\nEmpirical studies suggest that firms rely on patent protection for technology transfer along all\nthree channels discussed above\u2014trade, FDI, and licensing\u2014as such transfers raise a risk of\nleakage and imitation in recipient countries. Thus, patents can be used to measure direct\ninternational technology diffusion.\nIn our analysis, we define a transfer as a patent application filed by an inventor residing in a\ncountry that is different from the one in which protection is sought (e.g., a patent filed in the\nUnited States by an inventor working in Germany26). This indicates a transfer because patenting\nprovides the exclusive right to commercially exploit the technology in the country where the\npatent is filed. As patenting is costly, the inventor requests protection because he\/she plans to\nuse the technology locally. This approach (i.e., using patents to measure direct technology dif-\nfusion) has also been used by Eaton and Kortum (1996, 1999) and Lanjouw andMody (1996).27\nThe data indicate that during the 1990s, the number of climate-mitigation patents filed\nabroad increased at an average annual rate of 8 percent. However, this rapid growth is\nnot unique to climate-mitigation technology; rather, it corresponds to a general increase\nin international technology transfers over the same period. Figure 3 shows the share of\nclimate-mitigation transfers in total patent transfers between 1978 and 2005.\nTechnology Flows between OECD and Non-OECD Countries\nWhat are the origins and destinations of these transfers? Table 3 presents the distribution of\nclimate-mitigation technology flows between OECD and non-OECD countries from 2000 to\n2005. As a benchmark, the table also displays (in parentheses) the origin and destination data\nfor technology transfers overall. In both cases, technology is exchanged mostly between\nFigure 3 Transfers of climate-mitigation technologies as a share of total transfers.\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations, based on PATSTAT data.\n26We use information on the inventor\u2019s country of residence, irrespective of his nationality, to determine\nwhere inventions are developed.\n27Another strand of the literature relies on patents as an indicator for international technology spillovers, that\nis, diffusion that occurs outside the market. This literature uses patent citations (which include information\nabout the location of the inventor) to shed light on the international diffusion of technical knowledge. See the\nseminal paper by Jaffe, Trajtenberg, and Henderson (1993).\nInvention and Transfer of Climate Change\u2013Mitigation Technologies 121\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/reep.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nindustrialized countries (about 77 percent of total transfers), while transfers between devel-\noping countries are almost nonexistent (1 percent of total transfers).\nTechnology flows from OECD to non-OECD economies account for only 22 percent of all\nclimate-mitigation transfers. This is, however, slightly higher than the share (16 percent) for\nall technologies. Climate-mitigation technology flows to non-OECD countries mostly\nconcern fast-growing economies. In particular, China accounts for about three-quarters\nof the climate-mitigation transfers from OECD to non-OECD countries.\nOur data show that the flows of climate-mitigation inventions from OECD to non-OECD\neconomies have increased recently. Figure 4 indicates technology flows from OECD to\nnon-OECD countries as a share of total transfers for climate and all technologies. There\nappears to be a decoupling of climate and all technologies around 1998. This mirrors the\npattern in Figure 2, which shows that innovation in China also started to increase around\n1998 and perhaps provides support for the argument that China\u2019s environmental policies had\nalready encouraged domestic demand for climate-friendly technologies.\nRate of Export of Inventions\nWe use the export rate, defined as the share of inventions that are patented in more than\none country, as an indicator of the level of international technology diffusion. For the 2000\u2013\n2005 period, this rate is 17 percent for all technologies and slightly lower (15 percent) for cli-\nmate-mitigation technologies. However, there are significant differences at the country level.\nTable 3 Origin\u2013destination matrix: distribution of exported climate-mitigation inventions from 2000 to\n2005\nOrigin\nDestination\nOECD Non-OECD\nOECD 73% (77%) 22% (16%)\nNon-OECD 4% (6%) 1% (1%)\nSource: Authors\u0001 calculations, based on PATSTAT data.\nNote: Results for \u2018\u2018all technologies\u2019\u2019 appear in parentheses.\nFigure 4.

Countries in\nEurope and North America are the world leaders in technology exports, with export rates\nranging from 40 to 90 percent. This strong performance likely reflects the success of economic\nintegration in the European Union and North American Free Trade Association areas, as\nmany of the transfers occur between their member countries. In contrast, Korea, Japan,\nand Australia have had relatively poor export performance. This is especially striking in\nthe case of Japan, which is the leader in climate-mitigation innovation but fails to diffuse\nits technology abroad. Similarly, Table 4 indicates that the strong innovation performance\nof China, Russia, and Brazil is not reflected in their export rates, again suggesting that\nthe average value of inventions in emerging economies is low.\nThe data reveal that the export rate of patents also varies across technologies (see Table 5).\nThe most widely diffused technologies are lighting, wind power, and electric and\nhybrid vehicles, with more than 30 percent of inventions transferred. In contrast, waste,\nbiomass, and hydro are more localized, with less than 20 percent of inventions transferred.\nInterestingly, the propensity of a technology to be exported does not appear to be correlated\nTable 4 Rate of export of inventions by inventor country (2000\u20132005)\nInventor country Rate of export of inventions (%)\nThe Netherlands 89.9\nUnited Kingdom 60.3\nFrance 46.1\nGermany 56.1\nCanada 56.9\nUnited States 42.3\nKorea 24.5\nJapan 21.7\nAustralia 15.8\nChina 6.8\nBrazil 6.9\nSource: Authors\u0001 calculations, based on PATSTAT data.\nTable 5 Rate of export of inventions by technology (2000\u20132005)\nTechnology Export rate (%)\nLighting 36.3\nWind 30.7\nElectric and hybrid 29.8\nInsulation 26.8\nHeating 25.4\nSolar 25.2\nMarine 24.8\nCement 24.0\nGeothermal 22.2\nHydro 19.9\nMethane 18.9\nBiomass 18.7\nWaste 15.6\nSource: Authors\u0001 calculations, based on PATSTAT data.\nInvention and Transfer of Climate Change\u2013Mitigation Technologies 123\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/reep.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nwith the share of inventions related to that technology that is developed by emerging\neconomies, suggesting that technology-specific characteristics are the determining factor.\nConclusions\nWe conclude with a summary of our findings and discussions of policy options for accelerat-\ning the transfer of climate-mitigation technologies to developing countries and directions for\nfuture research.\nSummary of Findings\nThis article has used the PATSTAT to examine the dynamics, distribution, and international\ntransfer of patented inventions in thirteen climate-mitigation technology classes between\n1978 and 2005. We find that innovation in climate change technologies is highly concentrated\nin Japan, Germany, and the United States (together accounting for 60 percent of total climate-\nmitigation innovations in our dataset) but that the innovation performance of certain\nemerging economies, particularly China and Russia, as well as South Korea, is far from being\nnegligible. The data also suggest that innovation was driven mostly by energy prices until\n1990. Since then, environmental policies and climate policies appear to have induced more\ninnovation, with the pace of innovation accelerating since 2000.\nThe issue of international technology transfer is currently high on the political agenda. Our\ndata indicate that historically international transfers of climate-mitigation technologies have\noccurred mostly between developed countries. However, there appears to be tremendous\npotential for North\u2013South transfers, as well as South\u2013South exchanges\u2014particularly since\nthese countries may have developed inventions that are better tailored to the needs of\ndeveloping countries.\nPolicies to Accelerate Technology Diffusion\nHow can the diffusion of climate-mitigation technologies to developing countries be encour-\naged and accelerated? Our data do not allow us to assess the potential impact of different\npolicy tools. However, the more general literature on the economics of technology diffusion\noffers some interesting insights.\nRegulation is one obvious policy instrument that can be used to foster the creation of mar-\nkets for environmentally sound technologies and provide an incentive for firms to acquire\nnew technologies. Since historically industrialized countries have more advanced environ-\nmental and climate regulations, it is not surprising that they have also attracted more tech-\nnology transfer. It has been established, for example, that strict vehicle emission regulations in\nthe United States led to the transfer of technology from Japan and Germany to the United\nStates (Lanjouw andMody 1996) and, similarly, that the adoption of tighter regulations in the\npulp and paper industry in Finland and Sweden triggered an increase in patent applications\non chlorine-free technology filed by U.S. inventors in these countries (Popp, Hafner, and\nJohnstone 2007). Our data suggest that more recently, domestic regulation in China may\nhave spurred technology flows into the country.\nHowever, the lack of strict environmental and climate legislation in developing countries is\nclearly not the only explanation for the lower rates of climate-mitigation technology transfer\nto these countries, as our data indicate a similar pattern of low diffusion for all technologies.\n124 Dechezlepre\u02c6tre et al.\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/reep.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nMore general factors such as trade openness, the IPR system, and local absorptive capacities\n(e.g., human capital) also help explain why technology diffusion is concentrated in indus-\ntrialized countries.\nSince technology transfers take place through market channels such as trade, FDI, or\nlicenses, they occur more frequently in open economies (Saggi 2002; Hoekman, Maskus,\nand Saggi 2005). Lowering barriers to trade and FDI is thus a way to foster technology trans-\nfers. Duke, Jacobson, and Kammen (2002) show, for example, that the reduction of tariffs on\nsolar modules in Kenya increased imports of PV systems. Foreign investment also responds to\na healthy business environment that includes adequate governance and economic institutions\n(Maskus 2004).\nWhether a stronger IPR regime can foster the transfer of climate-mitigation technology to\ndeveloping countries is a controversial issue.28 As IPR confer legal exclusivity, they may\nreduce competition and raise price barriers to technology transfer in developing countries.\nHowever, several case studies suggest that IPR does not eliminate competition in markets for\nenvironmental technologies. Barton (2007) finds that patent issues are unlikely to be a barrier\nfor the transfer of solar PV, wind power, and biofuel technologies in emerging economies.\nSimilarly, Ockwell et al. (2008) show that IPR is not the main barrier to the transfer of\nintegrated gasification combined cycle\u2014the most efficient coal power technology\u2014to India.\nOn the contrary, empirical evidence suggests that effective patent protection is a means to\npromote technology transfer toward developing countries when foreign technology providers\nface the threat of imitation by local competitors (Maskus 2000; Smith 2001; Hoekman,\nMaskus, and Saggi 2005; Mancusi 2008; Parello 2008). Along the same lines, stronger\npatent protection encourages the use of FDI and licenses, which induces technology transfer\nthat goes beyond the mere export of equipment or goods (Smith 2001).\nSince the positive effect of IPR depends on the threat of local imitation, it mostly concerns\nthose recipient countries that already have technology capabilities, such as emerging econo-\nmies. More generally, there is strong evidence that countries need absorptive capacities in\norder to successfully adopt foreign technology (Keller 1996). The higher the level of domestic\nhuman capital, the higher the level of foreign technology transfer (Eaton and Kortum 1996),\nas well as local spillovers from trade and FDI (Borensztein, De Grego\u00b4rio, and Lee 1998). By\ncontrast, low absorptive capacities mean shortages of skilled technical personnel, a lack of\ninformation on available technologies, and high transaction costs (Worrell et al. 1997; Metz\net al. 2000). This highlights the importance of long-term education and capacity building\npolicies and programs in promoting North\u2013South technology transfer.\nDirections for Future Research\nThe research presented in this article has been mostly descriptive and does not examine in\ndetail or seek to explain the drivers of innovation and technology transfer. Clearly an impor-\ntant area for future research would be to complement this descriptive study with econometric\nanalyses of climate-mitigation technology innovation and diffusion worldwide.\n28The controversy has mainly revolved around the agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property\nright (TRIPS) that was negotiated in 1994, at the end of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on\nTariffs and Trade. The TRIPS agreement establishes minimum standards for intellectual property and is\naimed at encouraging developing countries to strengthen their IPR regimes.\nInvention and Transfer of Climate Change\u2013Mitigation Technologies 125\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/reep.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nAcknowledgement\nThe authors are grateful to two anonymous referees and Suzanne Leonard for helpful com-\nments and suggestions.

Invention and diffusion of CCS technologies\nThe CCS data are presented in this appendix because this dataset was constructed in a differ-\nent way than the other datasets. More specifically, in collaboration with patent examiners\nfrom the EPO, the CCS data were assembled through a search of the EPO\u0001s DOCDB database\nusing keyword searches and a variety of different internal patent classification systems\n(see Has\u02c7c\u02c7ic\u02c7 et al. 2010). While this creates a language bias, IPC searches in PATSTAT could\nnot reliably identify the relevant documents.29\nThe CCS technology is still at an early stage of development. Thus, the volume of patenting\nactivity in this field is quite low compared to other climate-mitigation technologies. As shown\nin Figure 5, between 1978 and 1996 less than one hundred CCS inventions were patented\nworldwide annually. However, the innovation trend accelerated sharply in 1997, reflecting a\nnew interest in this technology. Since then, the average annual growth rate of innovation has\nbeen about 20 percent, twice the rate of the 1978\u20131996 period.\nThe average export rate of CCS inventions was 20.5 percent from 2000 to 2006, significantly\nabove the rate for other climate-mitigation technologies (15 percent), suggesting a higher\nquality of patented inventions, which is consistent with an early stage of technology\ndevelopment.\nThe United States is by far the leading CCS inventor country, with about half of global\ninventions between 2000 and 2005 and one-third of exported inventions. Japan is second,\nwith 11% of global inventions, followed closely by Canada (7 percent), Germany (6 percent),\nand the Netherlands and France (5 percent each). With 4 percent of total CCS inventions,\nChina\u2019s share is roughly equivalent to that of a large European country.\nFigure 5 Patented CCS inventions worldwide (1978\u20132006).\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations, based on PATSTAT data.\n29This is because CCS technology is not easily identifiable using the IPC scheme. As discussed in the data\nsection of this article, in preparing this dataset no effort has been made to correct for differences in patent\nbreadth and other patent office-specific factors.\nInvention and Transfer of Climate Change\u2013Mitigation Technologies 127\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/reep.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nAppendix 3.
