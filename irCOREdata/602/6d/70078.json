However, we suggest that small-magnitude\nerosion events have a disproportionately large potential\nto cause P pollution and have short return periods. All\nwater erosion should therefore be treated as a potential\nthreat to water quality if the resulting sediment is likely\nto reach surface water bodies. We suggest the use of\ncultivations on the contour and minimal tillage to miti-\ngate this threat.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe support of the European Commission, IACR-Rotham-Fig. 9.
