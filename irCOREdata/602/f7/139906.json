The process, the result of a feasibility study, was firstly analysed by drawing \nflowcharts; potential problems and flow bottlenecks were then identified and their solutions \nwere pursued using a \u2018soft\u2019 problem solving approach. \n \n1. INTRODUCTION \n \nThe research presented here is the analysis of the initial stages of scaling up of a laboratory \nscale process. Whilst the general process was specifically developed for thick film PZT \nproduction, the sub-processes within it are commonly used in ceramic manufacture. \nTherefore, many of the process scale up issues and methodologies discussed here are of \ngeneral applicability in ceramic manufacture. \nProcess design of a manufacturing system \nThe design of a manufacturing system is of particular importance as corrections after process \nimplementation are extremely expensive and not always successful. \nThe focus on product design and development begins after the \u201cProduct Idea\u201d has been \nscreened and accepted. Fig 1 shows schematically how such a new product introduction \ncould be mapped1.  \n 2\nAfter the \u201cProduct Idea\u201d has been generated and its feasibility has been demonstrated, an \nimplementation project starts. Its output is a prototype ready for further scale up.  \nThe feasibility study produces a process that demonstrates its potentiality but which is not \nrefined and adjusted in order to allow easy scale up. By the subsequent phases of \n\u201cConceptual Design\u201d and \u201cDefinitive Design\u201d the most compact, efficient and economical \nprocess outline is created in order to permit higher product yield. The general rule is that \nmanufacturing systems should be kept as simple as possible. \nIn the \u201cConceptual Design\u201d phase existing technological options to develop a product are \nevaluated and applied, together with an evaluation of issues regarding suitable manufacturing \nfacilities. Thus the original process layout, derived from the feasibility study stage, is \nchanged to originate a \u201cslimmer\u201d sequence of operations reducing risks, eliminating \nbottlenecks and facilitating the following work. \nThe \u201cDefinitive Design\u201d stage then refines the parameters, tests the process on a larger scale \nand solves the remaining problems, giving birth to the final process prototype. \nMethodologies for developing Conceptual Design \nIn the \u201cConceptual Design\u201d stage the problems arising from a detailed study of the \nFeasibility stage are faced. \nThe classical approach is the so called \u201creductionist\u201d2 method where each problem is divided \ninto a more complex structure of sub problems and the solution of each one is pursued. \nAnother way, that has demonstrated its value and advantages, is the \u201cConcurrent \nEngineering\u201d2 or \u201cSimultaneous Engineering\u201d methodology. It assesses the process in a \nholistic manner, giving a broader view and developing solutions for different problems at the \nsame time. This approach has been shown2 to enhance the identification and reduction of the \nrisks and hence to be more robust and also more economical in a long term. \n 3\nSeveral \u201cProblem Solving\u201d methodologies3,4 can be adopted to facilitate Conceptual design: \nhard problem solving methodology can be used for structured problems where a quantitative \naspect can be highlighted. The soft5,6  problem solving approach (Soft System Methodology, \nSSM) is used when ill-structured difficulties need to be considered. \nBoth approaches consist of a series of stages to guide the analyst to face a wide variety of \ncomplications; they lead to the answers in an iterative manner. Soft and hard systems are to \nbe considered complementary rather than substitutive. \nIn this paper a first approach to the problems arising from a detailed study of the process to \nbe scaled up is made. The problem solving approach chosen is the SSM technique. \n2. METHOD \nNavarro et al.7 developed an aqueous laboratory scale process for PZT ceramic, using the \ntape casting technique as the forming method. That work was taken as the feasibility study \nunderlying the work reported here. The experimental conditions to develop the process are \ndescribed elsewhere7. \nThe first stage of the process analysis was the collection of data from the lab-scale process. \nThis was achieved by reproducing the process. The list of functional, material and visual \nrequirements for the product (the \u2018specifications\u2019) is the key for assessing the process in \nterms of quality of goods produced.  \nIn the second stage the detailed structure of operations to be carried out was analysed. Flow \ncharts of the process were therefore drawn in order to achieve a clear and wide image of the \nprocess. By dividing the system into sub-systems, it was broken up into more controllable \nunits. For each subsystem inputs and outputs were identified.  \nSoft problem solving methodology was used: once identified, the problems were analysed \nconsidering their impact on the entire process. The causes were investigated, with a \nrestriction on their number such that they would be amenable to a detailed study.  \n 4\nLastly a series of potential solutions to the problems were evaluated; data were collected \nfrom literature examples, patents, existing processes, academic papers and related theories, \ncomparing them with the problem needs. These were then compared with the problem \nrequirements. \n3. RESULTS  \nFig.2 and Fig.2b show the material flow charts of the process. On this chart are indicated in \ndetail the required operations, material transfers and process conditions. This chart gives an \nimage of what happens to the product during manufacture. Standard symbols, which are \npublished by ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers), were used throughout. \nThe phases are described and analysed in Table 1. As shown three main phases are present in \nthe process, giving a total time of 103 hours. The final result of this work is a single ceramic \nwafer plus a green cast tape.  \n4. DISCUSSION \nIn general the total process time is high, especially considering the small yield: the majority \nof the material is wasted during the process. If all the quantity of the material was taken to \nthe final sintering stage the yield would be the 40% of the initial input (32 g of sintered \nsamples versus 80 g of powder initially processed). \nTwo main \u201cwastes\u201d6 underlie this problem: waste during transfers of material (Waste of \nTransporting) and inadequate final transforming step (phase 3) (Waste of Inappropriate \nProcessing). The latter is, of course, an artefact of a research lab scale process much more so \nthan is the former. \nConsidering the flow charts in more detail it can be noted that:  \nDuring slip preparation: the two de-airing methods that are used are difficult to scale up and \ntwo material transfers are used which inevitably cause material waste. \n 5\nIn the tape casting step, the length of the tape casting bench is a possible limiting factor for \nthe implementation of the production and the drying time for the green tape is high, keeping \nthe tape casting bench engaged. \nIn the burn out of organics and sintering stage, these have been set as separate steps \n(operations 17 &18 Fig 2b). It is possible to sinter only a single ceramic piece at a time.  \nAll these problems afflict the process and have to be solved to provide a new, more efficient \nand simpler layout. \nImprovement of process following the SSM approach  \nThe SSM approach starts with the most important process bottlenecks. In this process these \nare identified as lying in Phase 3 (see Fig 2b). Two examples of the problem solving \napproach are given here.  \na)Unlinked furnace steps:  \nAs it can be seen in Fig 2b operations 17 & 18 are unlinked, thus time is wasted in cooling \ndown the furnace, followed by reheating. Moreover, there is the risk of damage to the \nceramic piece, which is extremely fragile after the burn out of binder and plasticizer. \nIn the feasibility study this was required because of: the necessity of burning out organics in \npresence of excess of oxygen and subsequently the requirement of creating a controlled \natmosphere, rich in PbO, during sintering to prevent lead losses at high temperature. In the \nfeasibility study the latter was maintained by covering the sample with an alumina crucible. \nTwo solutions for the problem were considered. Firstly, to put the cover from the beginning \non the sample and set an appropriate (slow) temperature profile; secondly, to create a \nmechanism for lowering from outside the furnace the covering crucible when the organics \nwere burnt out completely. \n These solutions were compared and the first judged the more feasible as it involved a \nsmaller number of process variables. Therefore, a series of laboratory tests were performed to \n 6\ncheck its feasibility. As a result, ceramic pieces with mechanical and electrical characteristics \nsimilar to those obtained from unlinked operations 17 &18 were obtained. Table 2 shows the \ncomparison of electrical characteristics of the samples attained using the feasibility study \nprocess and the new process. \nAn unsatisfactory burn out of the organics could lead to the formation of undesirable fumes \nand residues that might affect the sintering stage, creating defects. To check the limiting \namount of tape to be burnt out at a time, several samples were sintered together. It was \nshown that it was possible to sinter up to 7 samples at a time without causing notable \nsintering defects. \nBy setting the new profile, operations 17 and 18 in Fig.4 were condensed. This reduced \nPhase 3 time from 48 to 28 hours (a reduction of about 42 % of Phase 3 time and \napproximately 20% of the total process time). \nb) Sintering of multiple samples: \nAs shown in Fig 2b, only one piece of ceramic at a time was sintered, leading to a very small \nprocess throughput. The target would be to sinter a quantity of green tape as close as possible \nto the amount of the tape cast. \nIn the feasibility study this methodology was used as firstly PZT tapes adhere to each other if \nput in contact during sintering, and secondly, the dimension and the shape of the alumina \nsupport allowed only one sample to be sintered at a time. \nFrom a literature review a possible solution was noted in the work of  Feng et al9 . They were \nable to sinter several samples at a time, separated by a tape cast buffer sheet manufactured \nfrom coarse (approximately 18 \u00b5m) zirconia powder and a polymer. A second solution would \nbe to set up a belt furnace system that could sinter samples in continuous mode. The latter \nsolution  is expensive and would involve the creation of new problems such as the \nmaintenance of lead oxide controlled atmosphere.  \n 7\nThe feasibility of the former solution  was demonstrated by the production of sintered stacks \nof 5 samples which were successively easily detached.    Moreover by stacking the wafers on \na series of shelves it was possible to increase the number of wafers that were produced. \nIn summary, by combining the solutions to the multiple sintering and unlinked furnace steps \nissues it was shown that it was possible to reduce the Phase 3 step time by a total of 20% and \nincrease the throughput by producing 5 samples at a time. The newly obtained process layout \nfor Phase 3 is shown in Fig.3. \n5. CONCLUSIONS \nBy analysing in details the processes obtained from a feasibility study of an aqueous ceramic \nsystem, it has been possible to identify problems and bottlenecks. By solving the problems \nwith a holistic approach typical of the Concurrent Engineering methodology, using the Soft \nProblem Solving technique, the process has been reorganised, obtaining a simpler, better \ncontrolled and more functional process. \n \n6.
