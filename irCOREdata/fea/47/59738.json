Coral\nreefs are excellent sea level indicators, and their accurate dating by mass spectrometry\nis of prime importance for determination of the timing of deglaciation events and\nthus for understanding of the mechanisms driving glacial\u2013interglacial cycles. Further-\nmore, scleractinian coral colonies can monitor sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) and\nrecord past SSTs.\nSea Level Changes as a Global Climate Indicator\nOnly three deglaciation curves based on coral reef records have been accurately dated\nfor times reaching the Pleistocene\/Holocene boundary: in Barbados (Fairbanks, 1989;\nBard et al., 1990a, 1990b) between 19.00 and 8.00 ka, in New Guinea between 13.00\nand 6.00 ka (Chappell and Polach, 1991; Edwards et al., 1993), and in Tahiti between\n13.75 ka and 2380 14C y before present (BP) (Bard et al., 1996) (Fig. F1). So far, the\nBarbados curve is the only one to encompass the whole deglaciation because it is\nbased on offshore drilling. However, this site, like New Guinea, is located in an active\nsubduction zone where tectonic movements can be large and discontinuous, so that\nthe apparent sea level records may be biased by variations in the rates of tectonic up-\nlift. Hence, there is a clear need to study past sea level changes in tectonically stable\nregions or in areas where the vertical movements are slow and\/or regular.\nThe Barbados record suggested that the last deglaciation was characterized by two\nbrief periods of accelerated melting superimposed on a smooth and continuous rise\nof sea level with no reversals (Fig. F1). These so-called meltwater pulse (MWP)-1A and\nMWP-1B events (~13.80 and 11.30 ka, respectively) are thought to correspond to mas-\nsive inputs of continental ice (i.e., ~50\u201340 mm\/y, roughly equivalent to annual dis-\ncharge rates of 16,000 km3 for MWP-1A). MWP-1A corresponds to a short and intense\ncooling period between 14.10 and 13.90 ka in the Greenland records (Johnsen et al.,\n1992; Grootes et al., 1993) and therefore postdates the initiation of the B\u00f6lling-\nAller\u00f6d warm period at ~14.90\u201314.70 ka (Broecker, 1992). The sea level jump evi-\ndenced in New Guinea at 11.00 ka (Edwards et al., 1993) is delayed by a few centuries4\nExpedition 310 Scientific Prospectuswhen compared to that observed at Barbados. These two meltwater pulses are thought\nto have induced reef-drowning events (Blanchon and Shaw, 1995). Two \u201cgive-up\u201d reef\nlevels have been reported at 90\u2013100 and 55\u201365 m water depth on the Mayotte fore-\nslopes (Comoro Islands) and have been related to the B\u00f6lling and the post-Younger\nDryas meltwater pulses (Dullo et al., 1998); similar features are recorded in the south-\nern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) (Troedson and Davies, 2001) and in the Caribbean (Mac-\nIntyre et al., 1991; Grammer and Ginsburg, 1992). A third Acropora reef-drowning\nevent at ~7.60 ka has been assumed by Blanchon and Shaw (1995).\nHowever, there are still some doubts concerning the general pattern of sea level rise\nduring the last deglaciation events, including the amplitude of the maximum low-\nstand during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the occurrence of increased gla-\ncial meltwater with resultant accelerated sea level rise (Broecker, 1990). Furthermore,\nsawtooth sea level fluctuations between 19.00 and 15.28 ka (Locker et al., 1996) and\na sea level fall coeval with climatic changes at ~11 ka are still controversial topics.\nWorldwide sea level compilations indicate that local sea level histories varied consid-\nerably around the world in relation to both postglacial redistribution of water masses\nand a combination of local processes (Lambeck, 1993; Peltier, 1994), although signif-\nicant deviations between model predictions and field data have been noted in several\nregions (Camoin et al., 1997). The post\u2013last glacial sea level changes at sites located\nfar away from glaciated regions (\u201cfar field\u201d) provide basic information regarding the\nmelting history of continental ice sheets and the rheological structure of the Earth.\nThe effect of hydroisostasy depends on the size of the islands: for very small islands,\nthe addition of meltwater produces a small differential response between the island\nand the seafloor, whereas the meltwater load produces significant differential vertical\nmovement between larger islands or continental margins and the seafloor (Lambeck,\n1993). There is therefore a need to establish the validity of such effects at two ideal\nsites located at a considerable distance from the major former ice sheets: (1) on a small\noceanic island and (2) on a continental margin. In both cases, it is essential for the\nsites chosen that the tectonic signal is small or regular within the short time period\nproposed for investigation so that rigorous tests of proposed northern and southern\nhemisphere deglaciation curves from Barbados and New Guinea can be made. Two\nsuch places are proposed: Tahiti and the GBR. This mission-specific platform (MSP)\nexpedition will conduct investigations at the Tahiti sites only.5\nExpedition 310 Scientific ProspectusClimatic and Oceanographic Changes during Last Deglaciation \nEvents\nDuring latest Pleistocene and early Holocene, climatic variability was primarily re-\nlated to the effects of seasonality and solar radiation. The results of the Long-Range\nInvestigation, Mapping, and Prediction (CLIMAP) program suggested that LGM trop-\nical SSTs were similar to modern ones. However, this interpretation is not consistent\nwith snowline reconstructions and paleobotanic data (Rind and Peteet, 1985; Ander-\nson and Web, 1994).\nThe available Sr\/Ca and U\/Ca data from coral reef areas report SSTs 5\u00b0C colder than\ntoday during the LGM and 2\u00b0C lower at ~10\u20139 ka at Barbados (Guilderson et al.,\n1994), whereas studies in the west Pacific indicate that the full amplitude of the gla-\ncial Holocene temperature change may have ranged between 3\u00b0 and 6\u00b0C (McCulloch\net al., 1996; Beck et al., 1997; Gagan et al., 1998) (Fig. F1). Troedson and Davies (2001)\ndefine SSTs immediately south of the GBR some 4.5\u00b0C colder during the LGM and 1\u00b0C\ncolder at 10 ka. This casts doubt upon the phase shift of 3000 y for climate changes\nbetween the two hemispheres that was assumed by Beck et al. (1997), in clear distinc-\ntion to the apparent synchronism of the last deglaciation, inferred from various\nsources (i.e., coral records, ice cores, snowline reconstructions, vegetation records,\nand alkenone palaeothermometry) (Bard et al., 1997).\nRecent studies have documented Holocene climatic variations. SSTs warmer by 1\u00b0C,\nmonsoonal rainfall, and possibly weaker El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) at\n~5.80 ka in Eastern Australia have been deduced from isotopic and Sr\/Ca high-resolu-\ntion measurements on corals from the central GBR (Gagan et al., 1998). An ENSO-like\ncyclic climatic variation with a return period of 3\u20135 y has been evidenced in a 4150 y\nold coral from the Seychelles, although the intensity of the annual decrease in SST\ncaused by monsoonal cooling was lower than that of today (Zinke et al., 2005).\nAdditional information is required for better knowledge of climatic conditions in\ntropical regions during the last deglaciation. In these areas, the most debated points\nare twofold: (1) the quantification of SSTs and the identification of related climatic\nvariations during the last deglaciation events and (2) the timing of the relevant post-\nglacial warming in the two hemispheres. 6\nExpedition 310 Scientific ProspectusSCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES\nThis proposal succeeds a preliminary proposal submitted to the Joint Oceanographic\nInstitutions for Deep Earth Sampling (JOIDES) in September 1997 to drill drowned\nreefs and reef terraces at Tahiti. The present submission is a revised version of Proposal\n519, which was assessed in Fall 1998 by the Environment Science Steering and Eval-\nuation Panel (ESSEP). It includes some revised sections that address a few comments\nraised in the panel discussion and concerning the scientific objectives and technical\/\noperational issues. As noted by ESSEP during its fall 1998 review, \u201cthe goals are well-\naligned with the high-priority objectives of the Long Range Plan (1996) and cover the\ntwo subthemes \u2018Earth\u2019s Changing Climate\u2019 and \u2018Causes and Effects of Sea Level\nChange\u2019.\u201d These aims are related to other international scientific programs such as In-\nternational Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP), Past Global Changes (PAGES) and\nPAGES\/Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) interface. \n1. To establish the course of postglacial sea level rise at Tahiti (i.e., to define the exact shape \nof the deglaciation curve for the period 20.00\u201310.00 ka. \nThe expected results are the following:\n\u2022 To assess the validity, timing, and amplitude of the MWP-1A event;,\n\u2022 To assess the maximum sea level drop during the LGM,\n\u2022 To prove or disprove the sawtooth pattern of sea level rise during the last deglacia-\ntion (Locker et al., 1996), and\n\u2022 To test predictions based on different ice and rheological models.\nReconstruction of sea level curves relies on absolute dating of in situ corals by radi-\nometric methods (230Th\/234U by thermal ionization mass spectrometry [TIMS], 14C\nby accelerator mass spectrometry [AMS]), and paleobathymetric information de-\nduced from biological communities (corals, algae, and mollusks) that live in a suf-\nficiently narrow or specific depth range to be useful as absolute sea level indicators. \n2. To define SST variations for the region over the period 20.00\u201310.00 ka in order gain better \nknowledge of\n\u2022 Regional variation of SSTs in the South Pacific,\n\u2022 Climatic variability and the identification of specific phenomena such as ENSO,\nand\n\u2022 Global variation and relative timing of postglacial climate change in the southern\nand northern hemispheres.7\nExpedition 310 Scientific ProspectusMethods include stable isotope (\u03b418O) and trace element (Sr\/Ca ratios by TIMS)\nanalyses on high-resolution (i.e., at the monthly scale) sampling of massive coral\ncolonies. Coupled analyses of \u03b418O and Sr\/Ca on the same sample may yield esti-\nmates of both temperature and salinity (McCulloch et al., 1996). Stable isotope \u03b418O\nmeasurements, systematically coupled with those of \u03b418O in coral skeletons, will\nprovide information on other parameters (e.g., solar variations or metabolism pro-\ncesses). Geochemical methods will be coupled with measurements and analyses of\nthe bandwidths and microstructural variations in the coral skeletons.\n3. To analyze the impact of sea level changes on reef growth and geometry and, especially\n\u2022 The impact of glacial meltwater phases (identification of reef drowning events),\n\u2022 The morphological and sedimentological evolution of the foreslopes (highstand\nversus lowstand processes),\n\u2022 Modeling of reef building, and\n\u2022 Environmental changes during reef development.\nA numerical model simulating reef building will be used to study the effect of a sea\nlevel jump on reef geometry and to qualitatively assess the effect of sea level fluctua-\ntions on the reef shape and age-depth relationships.\nThe present proposal may provide the opportunity to better constrain the deglacial\nhistory (see Peltier, 1994; Fleming et al., 1998; Okuno and Nakada, 1999) by docu-\nmenting, for the first time, the LGM lowstand in well-studied cores in the far field and\nby comparing the MWP-1A event in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Furthermore,\nthe study of very early deglacial coral material should provide the first Sr\/Ca SSTs for\nthe LGM in the Pacific, which could then supplement Barbados sample data (Guilder-\nson et al., 1994) and the recent study of Stage 6 corals (McCulloch et al., 1999).\nPROPOSED DRILL SITES\nSite Location \nTahiti (17\u00b050\u2032 S, 149\u00b020\u2032 W; S = 142 km2) is the largest of the Society Islands and is\ncomposed of twin shield volcanoes that were active at 1.367 \u00b1 0.016 to 0.187 \u00b1 0.003\nMa. Subsidence rates of 0.25 mm\/y have been deduced from dating of aerial lava un-\nderlying the Pleistocene reef sequence. This island is surrounded by discontinuous\nfringing reefs that grade locally into a chain of barrier reefs, commonly interrupted\nand locally enclosing a narrow lagoon. The barrier reef complex includes, from land8\nExpedition 310 Scientific Prospectusseaward: a back-reef zone that corresponds to a 1 km wide bay, reaching a maximum\ndepth of 20 m, a relatively narrow reef-flat zone (130 m in maximum width), and an\nouter-reef slope that consists of coral-built spurs and grooves. In the northwest, the\nreef foreslope gently deepens seaward to a depth of 15 m and then steepens sharply\nto 50 m and forms an almost vertical wall between 50 and 100 m (Table T1; Fig. F2).\nBefore our site survey data (October 2002), the occurrence of two prominent terraces\nat 50 m and 90\u2013100 m, dipping seaward and exhibiting living coral reef was demon-\nstrated through a survey by the submersible Cyana (Salvat et al., 1985) and bathymet-\nric data from Port Autonome Papeete, Service Hydrographique et Oc\u00e9anographique\nde la Marine (SHOM), and Institut Fran\u00e7ais de Recherche pour l\u2019Exploitation de la Mer\n(IFREMER). \nScientific Achievements on Existing Holes\nThe first drilling operations on Tahiti reefs were carried out in Papeete Harbor, where\na 40 m long core penetrated the detrital talus close to the reef edge (Core ETM) and\n20 m long cores penetrated large patch reefs (Cores PAD3 and PPTD5) (Montaggioni,\n1988; Camoin and Montaggioni, 1994) (Fig. F2).\nSubsequently, the barrier reef edge facing Papeete has been cored at several points by\na Sedidrill drilling machine and coring system in 1992 and 1995 (Institut de Recher-\nche pour le D\u00e9veloppement [IRD, formerly ORSTOM] and Programme National R\u00e9cifs\nCoralliens [PNRCO] programs). Cores with diameters ranging from 48 to 64 mm were\nrecovered from two vertical (Holes P6 and P7) and three inclined (Holes P8, P9, and\nP10; 30\u00b0\u201333\u00b0 from vertical) drill holes (Fig. F3). Holes P6, P7, and P8 are located on\nthe outer barrier reef-flat, whereas Holes P9 and P10 were drilled on the edge of Pap-\neete Pass (see Camoin et al., 1999; Cabioch et al., 1999). Recovery in these P-series\ncores was dependent upon framework type and on the size of internal cavities but\nranged from 50% to 95%; sections with poor or no recovery generally correspond to\nunconsolidated sands. During drilling, the tube barrel was advanced in 1.5 m incre-\nments; core depths were estimated with \u00b10.3 m accuracy.\nExcept for the Core P6, the P-series cores penetrated the entire postglacial carbonate\nsequence beneath the reef edge and reached the antecedent substrate. The volcanic\nbedrock that lies beneath the reef has a general southwest\u2013northeast slope of 6\u00b0 and\ndips gently seaward (average = 10\u00b0). Below the barrier reef, the depth of the basaltic\nor terrigenous substrate ranges from 85.4 m (Core P9) to 114.0 m (Core P7), deepen-\ning toward the northeast. In Cores P9 and P10, the basalt is overlain by brownish clay9\nExpedition 310 Scientific Prospectusincluding pebbles of volcanic rocks that may correspond to the weathering profile of\nthe basalts. Correlations between the drill holes on the barrier reef and those in Pap-\neete Harbor (Cores ETM, PAD3, and PPTD5) indicate that the terrigenous deposits\nform a 18\u201345 m thick wedge below the modern back reef zone, thinning both seaward\nand landward (Camoin et al., 1999).\nThe overlying sequence may be subdivided into two units separated by a clear uncon-\nformity with evidence of subaerial exposure:\n1. The lower unit, up to 30 m thick, is probably late Pleistocene in age and occurs in\nCores P7 and P8 at 87.0 and 92.0 m deep, respectively, and is interpreted as having\nbeen deposited in a reef-flat environment and capped by a karst surface. It is absent\nin the area of Holes P9 and P10, where the volcanic substrate is much shallower.\n2. The upper unit encompasses the last 13.85 k.y. and exhibits stratigraphically con-\nsistent ages with no reversals (Bard et al., 1996). It ranges in thickness from 85.5 to\n92.5 m in Cores P9 and P8, respectively, and is primarily composed of in situ 0.1\u2013\n6 m thick coral frameworks alternating locally with unconsolidated coral rubble\nand skeletal sands, terrigenous sands, and silts (Camoin et al., 1999; Cabioch et al.,\n1999). It corresponds to the longest continuous postglacial reef sequence described\nso far (Montaggioni et al., 1997). The reconstructed sea level curve for the past\n13.70 k.y. is based on more than 100 U-Th dates confirming that the samples used\nfor this study are of high quality and remained closed geochemical systems in the\npast, thus implying that the measured ages are accurate. \nAvailable Site Survey Data at Tahiti\nBefore the SISMITA cruise (October 2002), bathymetric seafloor mapping and seismic\nlines at depths >250 m were carried out on the northern side of the island by the\nWashington in 1982, whereas SeaBeam data were collected during the ETM 19 cruise\nin 1983\u20131987 (Jean Charcot) (Voisset, 1990). Available data at depths >500 m around\nTahiti include bathymetric and acoustic data collected during the Zone Economique\nde Polyn\u00e9sie Fran\u00e7aise (ZEPOLYF) (Sichoix and Bonneville, 1996) and POLYDRAG1\n(1997) oceanographic cruises (Atalante and Alis, respectively), whereas available data\nat depths <250 m were restricted to bathymetric data around Papeete (IFREMER and\nSHOM) (i.e., in the vicinity of the proposed drilling Site TAH-01A). \nThe SISMITA cruise was carried out in October 2002 (18\u201324 October), using the Alis,\nowned by IRD. Shipboard participants included G. Camoin (Centre National de la Re-10\nExpedition 310 Scientific Prospectuscherche Scientifique\u2013Centre de Recherche en Gestion [CNRS-CEREGE]), G. Cabioch\n(IRD), F. Gallois (IRD), B. Hamelin (CEREGE), and G. Lericolais (IFREMER). During\nthis cruise we planned to acquire very high resolution seismic and multibeam bathy-\nmetric data at depths ranging from 50 to 250 m around Tahiti, especially in the three\nproposed drilling areas: offshore Papeete-Faaa (proposed Site TAH-01A), Tiarei (pro-\nposed Site TAH-02A), and Maraa (proposed Site TAH-03A) (Camoin et al., 2003). The\nmajor objectives were the following:\n\u2022 To determine the thickness and geometry of the postglacial (late Pleistocene\u2013Ho-\nlocene) reef sequence and, if possible, of the underlying carbonate units;\n\u2022 To identify unconformities in the carbonate units overlying the volcanic basement;\n\u2022 To evaluate the transitional patterns between the outer-reef slope and the downs-\nlope environments; and\n\u2022 To determine the morphology of the volcanic substrate.\nNavigation Data\nAccurate navigation information has been obtained from a Global Positioning System\n(GPS). Other information regarding water currents has also been acquired.\nMultibeam Data\nSimrad EM 1002, 100 kHz data have been acquired around Tahiti and Moorea at\ndepths ranging from 30\u201340 to 500\u2013700 m. The three target zones in Tahiti have been\nmapped in great detail.\nVery High Resolution Seismic Data\nIFREMER\/SIG seismic equipment: asynchronic THR seismic, sediment sounder, and\nsparker data have been collected in the three target zones in water depths ranging\nfrom 40 to 500 m (see maps of the seismic grids and profiles):\n\u2022 Along lines longitudinal and perpendicular to the axis of the barrier reef and\n\u2022 within grids of 6 km \u00d7  1 km (Tiarei area), 8.5 km \u00d7  1 km (offshore Papeete-Faaa),\nand 9 km \u00d7  1 km (Maraa area). The seismic lines are located at a minimal distance\nof 250 m from the barrier reef, and the distance between the lines forming the grid\nwere fixed to 200\u2013400 m in order to crosscut the proposed drilling sites. All poten-\ntial drilling target zones have crossing seismic lines.\nA total of 120 seismic lines have been carried out in the three target zones. In several\nlines, the hard bottom over most of the outer shelf inhibited subbottom penetration,11\nExpedition 310 Scientific Prospectusrendering interpretation of the recorded data problematic, although some internal\nstructure is revealed. This illustrates the difficulty of imaging drilling targets in reef\nenvironments.\nThe morphology of the fore-reef slope as obtained from echo and seismic profiling ex-\nhibits consistent features around Tahiti, especially in the three drilling target zones.\nThe most significant morphological features were imaged, mapped, and ground-tru-\nthed by a series of 38 dredgings at depths ranging from 50 to 500 m. The maps and\nthe seismic lines provided illustrate these features (see bathymetric maps and seismic\nlines in Figs. F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9, F10, F11, F12, and F13):\n\u2022 An extensive terrace recorded at 50\u201360 m water depth is characterized by build-ups\ncorresponding to relict reefs. The terrace is gently inclined seaward down to 90 m.\nThe reef sequence deposited on top of this terrace forms a sedimentary wedge that\npinches out at 90 m deep in the Tiarei area.\n\u2022 A narrower terrace typically characterizes depths ranging from 75 to 90\u2013100 m. It\ndisplays abundant build-ups that are interpreted as drowned reefs. In the Tiarei area\n(proposed Site TAH-02A), the height of these build-ups ranges from 30 m (base =\n100 m, top = 70 m below sea level) to 45 m (base = 90 m, top = 45 m below sea\nlevel). There is a clear break in slope at 90\u2013100 m, where the slope steepens sharply\nto form a cliff.\n\u2022 The transition zone between 90\u2013100 and 200\u2013250 m may correspond either to an\nalmost vertical wall or to a steep slope. A significant break in slope is observed at\n120\u2013130 m. This zone is generally composed of laterally discontinuous ledges and\ngives the appearance of being highly stratified down to a depth of 200 m. Build-ups\nas high as 45 m (base = 135 m, top = 90 m below sea level) on the slope are inter-\npreted as relict reef ridges.\n\u2022 A major reflector, possibly corresponding to the top of the volcanic basement, has\nbeen imaged from 120\u2013150 m water depth close to the cliff, up to 80 m below the\n60 m terrace.\nDredging\nDredging carried out on the successive reef terraces and slopes at depths ranging from\n50 to 500 m yielded reef material including coral colonies and fragments, coralline\nalgal encrustations, and microbial crusts (Camoin et al., in press). Datable material\nhas been obtained at all depths within the bathymetric range of the development of\nthe postglacial reef sequence (i.e., to 150 m below the present sea surface). It has\nserved to establish a preliminary chronological frame based on the radiometric dating12\nExpedition 310 Scientific Prospectus(U\/Th and 14C) of recovered corals and other datable organisms (Camoin et al., in\npress). \nCoring Strategy\nDrilling offshore Barbados (Fairbanks, 1989) demonstrated that the reef sequence cor-\nresponding to the last deglaciation developed only on slopes and therefore forms dis-\ncontinuous successive terraces of various lateral extent. \nRecovery of the whole postglacial reef sequence requires the drilling of successive reef\nterraces that occur seaward of the living barrier reef.\nStudies and surveys around Tahiti have demonstrated the occurrence of successive\nreef terraces at various depths, 100, 90, 60, and 40\u201350 m (see above), which therefore\ncorrespond to drilling targets. Thus, at each site, we propose to sample a transect of\nseveral offshore drill holes in order to recover the entire postglacial reef sequence.\nThe numerical model simulating reef building used to study the effect of sea level\njumps on the reef geometry in Tahiti has demonstrated that only offshore drilling can\nrecover the corals that were living during the period between the LGM and the MWP-\n1A event (Fairbanks, 1989) at 13.80 ka (see Bard et al., 1996, and subsequent unpub-\nlished tests with the same model). This reconstruction is supported by dating of reef\ndeposits related to the LGM and early deglacial stages in continuous drill holes with\nseaward deviations of 30\u00b0\u201345\u00b0, 300 m in length, carried out on the northeast rim of\nthe Moruroa atoll (French Polynesia; ages ranging from 15.55 \u00b1 0.08 ka to 23.51 \u00b1 0.07\nka) (Camoin et al., 2001), which then demonstrate the feasibility of our investigations\non the Tahiti slopes.\nBased on the results of previous scientific drilling and bathymetric and seismic data\nacquired during the SISMITA cruise, we propose to drill a transect of holes in three\nareas around Tahiti: offshore Papeete-Faaa (proposed Site TAH-01A), Tiarei (proposed\nSite TAH-02A), and Maraa (proposed Site TAH-03A). The involved water depths range\nfrom 40 to 310 m with one exception concerning the drilling of a keep-up reef in the\nTiarei area (water depth = 25 m). The detailed drilling plan is described below. Based\non the results of drilling carried out on the Papeete Reef and on the results of dredging\ncarried out during the SISMITA cruise, the expected lithologies for the postglacial reef\nsequence and the underlying Pleistocene carbonate units include reef frameworks\n(corals, algal crusts, etc.), lithified limestones, and carbonate sands. The depth of pen-13\nExpedition 310 Scientific Prospectusetration below seafloor to reach the volcanic basement should be <100 m at all sites.\nFurthermore, the volcanic basement will be penetrated at all sites.\nBathymetric and seismic data obtained for the three potential drilling sites, coupled\nwith the results of previous scientific drilling and dredging, demonstrate the feasibil-\nity of our project and that the proposed drilling plan is the best to recover the entire\npostglacial reef sequence. The location of the proposed drill holes and the expected\nthickness of the carbonate sequence have been determined on the basis of the avail-\nable site survey data (seismics, bathymetry, and dredging) and the data acquired on\nthe drill holes carried out on the Papeete Reef.\nThe exact location of the drill holes will be determined during the cruise by checking\nthe nature and morphology of the seafloor with a remotely operated vehicle (ROV)\nand\/or video. Ideally, a circle of ~100 m around the spots indicated below would give\nenough flexibility to reach the best targets. A 150 m circle around the spots indicated\nhas been accepted by the Environmental Pollution and Safety Panel (EPSP).\nOPERATIONAL STRATEGY\nDrilling Platform\nThe water depths for the proposed drilling sites in Tahiti range from 25 to 310 m and\nrequire the use of a mission-specific platform. The Hunter, a dynamically positioned\n(DP) vessel with a large moonpool, has been contracted as the drilling vessel. The\ndrilling contractor is Seacore of Gweek, Cornwall, who will install a drilling rig on the\nHunter over the moonpool and onto part of the aft deck. The Hunter is a class 2 DP\nvessel, and as such has a minimum dual redundancy in propulsion and navigation\nsystems which meets the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) and international\nenvironmental requirements for the Tahiti coring operation. \nCoring System\nAn HQ mining-type wireline coring system with a conductor to the seabed will be\nused for coring. This is commonly termed \u201cpiggy back\u201d coring because the mining\ncoring rig is installed on top of the conventional API rig, which will deploy the con-\nductor pipe. This allows minimum cuttings due to the small kerf on the bit, a smooth\nhole profile due to bit type, and the best chance of obtaining high quality and high\nrecovery of core. This type of equipment has been used extensively in other coral reef14\nExpedition 310 Scientific Prospectussituations world-wide and has a good track record. For offshore use the drill string is\nprotected by the conductor pipe to seabed. This serves both to avoid excessive string\nbending and provide a conduit to the vessel for any cuttings that come to the surface.\nExperience shows that the majority of cuttings are dissipated subsurface while coring. \nThe coring system for the project is outlined below.\nConductor Pipe\nThe conductor pipe is a heavyweight drill pipe or casing with an internal diameter\n(ID) of ~100 mm and a casing shoe to set it ~1 m into the seabed. A seabed template\nof ~1.5 m diameter and weighing 10\u201312 T will be deployed at the end of the conduc-\ntor pipe, which will sit on the seabed with the conductor pipe projecting through.\nThis pipe will be deployed with the main drilling power swivel attached to the main\nheave-compensation system of the drilling rig. The coring system will be installed\nabove this in piggy-back fashion so that all coring is carried out in compensated\nmode.\nWireline Coring System \nA mining-type assembly of triple tube configuration in the HQ range (core = 61 mm)\nwill allow the core bits to pass through the conductor pipe and core ahead. There will\nbe a range of core bits available, including surface set diamond or tailored impreg-\nnated bits, which are most likely to be used. As the base of each hole is intended to\nterminate in basement, a surface set diamond bit would allow the best opportunity to\ncomplete the borehole without a change of bit. However, reentry is possible, as there\nwill be a conductor pipe installed between the vessel and seabed.\nCoring Run Lengths\nTypically with mining tools, the maximum coring run to obtain optimum recovery is\n3 m. Shorter coring runs can be made to ensure that this high recovery is maintained\nin a reef environment, but additional time would be required for the additional wire-\nline trips. The excellent core recovery obtained on the Tahiti land-based coring used\n1.5 m runs and the same core diameter to be used in this expedition.\nWireline Overshot and Retrieval System\nAll inner barrels are wireline retrievable using a well-proven mining core barrel re-\ntrieval system. This allows continuous coring operations without having to pull the15\nExpedition 310 Scientific Prospectusdrill string to recover each core run and the flexibility to drill\/spot-core or take mea-\nsurements in any borehole without recourse to pulling the drill pipe.\nSeawater will normally be used for drilling.\nCore on Deck\nOnce the drilling operation commences and cores begin to come on deck, the coring\noperations team will be responsible for delivering that core to the laboratory for ex-\namination and curation. The operation will proceed using a changeover of inner core\nbarrels to ensure continuity of the coring operation in as timely a fashion as possible.\nThe deck operators will deploy an empty core barrel immediately after the full one\nhas been retrieved, then address the core removal and readying of that core barrel for\nreuse. The cores will be collected in a plastic liner and IODP curation procedures will\nbe followed.\nGas detection equipment will be carried as part of the total coring operation. \nDownhole Logging\nThis service is contracted as part of the services for the Tahiti expedition and will be\nmanaged by the European Petrophysics Consortium (EPC). The logging equipment\nand team will be interfaced for a seamless operation on board the drill ship, ready to\nundertake any requirements as the project progresses. \nTo facilitate downhole measurements and core petrophysics for MSPs, the EPC has\nbeen developing protocols for use both offshore and as part of the shore-based party.\nIn all expeditions the downhole logging program will be integrated with the scientific\nobjectives to ensure maximum scientific output. This may include the use of specialty\nthird-party tools.\nUnlike the Chikyu and nonriser vessels where the pipe size is constant and allows a\nstandard set of logging tools to be deployed, MSPs have variable pipe sizes and drill\nin a variety of water depths, each of which provides constraints on the anatomy of\nlogging operations. Pipe diameter is the controlling factor, and for this expedition\nslim-hole mining-type logging tools will be utilized. Nuclear sources will not be de-\nployed. 16\nExpedition 310 Scientific ProspectusCamera and\/or ROV\nThe water depths involved in the general drilling plan related to this proposal range\nfrom 40 to 310 m with two exceptions concerning the drilling of keep-up reefs and\nbuild-ups on the reefs in the Tiarei and Maraa areas (water depths, respectively = 25\nand 30 m). Seventeen of the 19 drill sites are deeper than 40 m, which corresponds to\nthe limit where the abundance of the living cover (especially the coral cover) de-\ncreases sharply and becomes limited (40\u201350 m water depth) to almost zero (below 50\nm). For the two drill sites shallower than 40 m above (keep-up reefs), an ROV and\/or\nvideo camera will be used to accurately determine the location of the drill sites, on\nsand or bare rocks, and help avoid damage to living coral heads.\nEach site drilled within the active reef (and preferably at all drilling sites) will be mon-\nitored using a through-pipe video system to ensure that the landing area is free from\nliving coral heads. Additionally, the same camera system will be utilized on comple-\ntion of the borehole to take photographs to show the effects of the coring in the im-\nmediate vicinity of the borehole. These before and after photographs will be stored\nwith the drilling data.\nSCIENCE OPERATIONS\nA sampling and measurements plan for Expedition 310 (see the \u201cAppendix\u201d) was\nprepared to meet the scientific objectives of IODP Proposal 519-Add2 following the\nrecommendations of the Science Advisory Structure. \nOffshore Science Operations at Tahiti \nIt should be possible to carry out all necessary scientific work on board the ship. After\ndue consideration, it has been decided that the cores will not be split at sea, as it will\nbe more efficient to carry out most of the scientific analysis during an onshore party\nat Bremen. Therefore, there will be only limited scientific analysis carried out on\nboard and only a limited number of scientists will be required to sail. It is currently\nplanned that core will be cut (unless there is a continuous section of a massive coral\ncolony) on board into 1.5 m lengths and curated. The core catcher sample will be split\nand a visual description recorded. Samples for microbiology will be taken and suitably\nstored for analysis. Some preliminary microbiology measurements will be conducted\noffshore (see \u201cMicrobiology\u201d in the \u201cAppendix\u201d).17\nExpedition 310 Scientific ProspectusStaffing\nScientific staffing has been decided on the basis of task requirements and nomina-\ntions from the ECORD Science Support Advisory Committee (ESSAC), U.S. Science\nAdvisory Committee (USSAC), Japan Drilling Earth Science Consortium (JDESC), and\nMinistry of Science and Technology (MOST) of the People\u2019s Republic of China. ESO\nstaffing is based on the need to carry out the drilling and scientific operations effi-\nciently and safely.\nThe following ESO and science staffing amounts to 23 participants:\nESO\n\u2022 1 Operations Superintendent \n\u2022 1 Staff Scientist \n\u2022 1 Trainee Staff Scientist\n\u2022 1 Petrophysics Staff Scientists\n\u2022 2 Curators\n\u2022 2 Drilling Coordinators\n\u2022 1 Database Operator \n\u2022 1 Electronics Engineer\n\u2022 1 ESO Petrophysicist\n\u2022 1 ESO Geochemist\n\u2022 2 Logging Contractors\n\u2022 1 Microbiology Technician\nOffshore Science Team \n\u2022 2 Co-Chief Scientists \n\u2022 2 Carbonate Sedimentologists \n\u2022 2 Coral Specialists\n\u2022 1 Microbiologist\n\u2022 1 Core Petrophysicist  \nDrillship Science Activities \nScience activities on the drillship are likely to be confined to those essential for early\nsampling and logging, as well as for safety and curation (see the \u201cAppendix\u201d for more\ndetails):\n\u2022 Basic curation and labeling of core,18\nExpedition 310 Scientific Prospectus\u2022 Core catcher lithological and macropaleontological analysis,\n\u2022 Core storage,\n\u2022 Petrophysics (see \u201cOffshore Petrophysics Measurements\u201d and \u201cAppendix\u201d),\n\u2022 Pore water sampling for chemistry\/circulation studies (if Scientific Party requests),\n\u2022 Collection\/storage of microbiology samples under appropriate conditions, and\n\u2022 Associated data management of all activities (see below).\nThe coral reefs require rotary coring, and the hard rock cores collected will be col-\nlected in ordinary liners. The cores will be split during the onshore party in Bremen. \nIn order to carry out the science requirements on the drillship with a small crew, a\nstaffing plan has been devised. The plan requires flexibility of approach from all par-\nticipants, with priority to safety, core recovery, curation, and procedures for the mea-\nsurement of ephemeral properties. \nCruise report preparation and compilation will take place on board. A detailed cruise\nreport will be broken down into the following sections:\n\u2022 Coring operations\n\u2022 Operations cost (which will be monitored daily)\n\u2022 Preliminary scientific results\n\u2022 Databasing\nRegular reports will be sent to IODP-MI in requested formats and at the required fre-\nquency. \nOffshore Petrophysical Measurements \nIt is planned to run all cores on the multisensor core logger (MSCL) (density, resistiv-\nity, velocity, and susceptibility) on board the drillship (see the \u201cAppendix\u201d for more\ndetails).\nTahiti Logging Operations\nConsidering the anticipated shallow depth of many holes, short tool strings are\nhighly recommended. Because of environmental concerns (shallow-water reef envi-\nronment) the use of chemical sources is prohibited; as such, density and porosity log-\nging tools that require these sources cannot be used. 19\nExpedition 310 Scientific ProspectusThree depth transects are planned, and the logging plan will be optimized through\nfurther discussions with the Co-Chief Scientists. It is envisioned that two holes per\ntransect will be fully logged, with a reduced logging plan in some of the other holes\n(subject to hole conditions). \nGiven the anticipated small diameter of the boreholes (HQ core bit outer diameter =\n96 mm), only slimline-type logging tools can be utilized. The following is a generic\nlist of minimum and additional tools, based on formation properties discussed with\nproponents, and not on operator-based trademark names:\nMinimum Measurements\n\u2022 Optical images: millimeter-scale geological description\n\u2022 Acoustic images: centimeter-scale impedance and mesoscale porosity \n\u2022 Spectral gamma logging: U, Th, K, and red algae \n\u2022 Acoustic velocity logging: VP and VS at 10\u201320 kHz) \n\u2022 Induction resistivity logging: pore fluid salinity and porosity \n\u2022 Hydrochemical borehole fluid logging: pressure, temperature, pH, Eh, SP, and fluid\nelectrical conductivity to identify fluid circulation\nOnshore Science Activities\nThe onshore sampling party is expected to take place during February 2006 under the\nsupervision of Dr. Ursula R\u00f6hl, manager of the IODP Bremen Core Repository (BCR). \nThe following facilities will be available for the expedition scientists at BCR (see the\n\u201cAppendix: Measurements Plan\u201d for more details):\n\u2022 Core splitting \n\u2022 Core description \n\u2022 Core photography \n\u2022 Core sampling\n\u2022 Thin section and smear slide preparation\n\u2022 Micropaleontology\n\u2022 Inorganic geochemistry \n\u2022 X-ray diffraction analysis \n\u2022 Petrophysical measurements20\nExpedition 310 Scientific ProspectusStaffing\nESO\n\u2022 1 Superintendent (Curation and Laboratory Manager) \n\u2022 1 Staff Scientist\n\u2022 1 Assistant Superintendent (Assistant Curation and Laboratory Manager)\n\u2022 1 Petrophysics Staff Scientist\n\u2022 1 ESO Petrophysicist\n\u2022 2 Curators\n\u2022 2 Database Operators\n\u2022 1 Trainee Staff Scientist\n\u2022 1 Yeoperson\n\u2022 Laboratory Team (provided by University of Bremen) \nExpedition Scientists\n\u2022 2 Co-Chief Scientists (2 sailing)\n\u2022 4 Carbonate Sedimentologists (2 sailing)\n\u2022 2 Coral Specialists (2 sailing)\n\u2022 1 Microbiologist (1 sailing)\n\u2022 2 Core Petrophysicists (1 sailing)\n\u2022 1 Foraminifer Paleontologist\n\u2022 10 Inorganic Geochemists (SST variation and dating)\n\u2022 1 Paleomagnetist\n\u2022 1 Igneous Petrologist\n\u2022 1 Observer\nData Management\nA detailed specification and configuration of data management systems for the Tahiti\nExpedition will be developed from the finalized science\/operational data require-\nments and operational logistics. The plan outline is as follows: \n\u2022 A modified version of the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program\n(ICDP) Drilling Information System (DIS) (OffshoreDIS) will be used to capture\ndrilling and core-related data during the operation and postoperation shore party\nphases.21\nExpedition 310 Scientific Prospectus\u2022 Data will be transferred to Janus and the World Data Center for Marine Environ-\nmental Sciences (WDC-MARE)\/Publishing Network for Geoscientific and Environ-\nmental Data (PANGAEA), the MSP data repository.\n\u2022 The data management plan and the petrophysics plan (developed by EPC) will be\nintegrated. \n\u2022 The longer-term plan for data management will take into account IODP Informa-\ntion Services requirements once these are known.\nOffshoreDIS will be configured to match the science\/operational requirements of the\nexpedition. The timing of transfer of metadata\/data from OffshoreDIS to WDC-\nMARE\/PANGAEA will depend on the data type and operational requirements; transfer\nformats, procedures, and data security policy\/implementation have still to be final-\nized.\nDEFINITION OF TAHITI SEA LEVEL EXPEDITION RESULTS \nDATA\nExpedition Report data for Tahiti Sea Level include the following:\n\u2022 All data collected on the drilling vessel during the expedition (Table T2).\n\u2022 All data derived from samples taken on the drilling vessel that are defined as min-\nimum measurements by the Scientific Measurements Panel (SciMP).\n\u2022 All data collected onshore during the science party (Table T2).\nSAMPLE ALLOCATION COMMITTEE AND SAMPLE \nREQUESTS\nThe IODP Sample, Data, and Obligations policy is scheduled to be published by 1 Oc-\ntober 2005 on the Program Policies page of the IODP Web site (www.iodp.org\/), and\nwill apply to Expedition 310.\nAccess to data and core samples during Expedition 310 or within the 1 y moratorium\nfollowing the onshore part of the expedition must be approved by the Sample Allo-\ncation Committee (SAC). \nThe SAC (composed of Co-Chief scientists, Staff Scientist, and ESO Curation Man-\nager\/IODP Curator onshore or the shipboard curatorial representative) will work with22\nExpedition 310 Scientific Prospectusthe Expedition Scientists to formulate a formal expedition-specific sampling plan for\npostcruise sampling.\nThe SAC has agreed that the review of sample requests will be deferred until after the\noffshore operation, so that sample requests can be reviewed in the context of the\nknown core recovery and lithology. \nAll sample frequencies and sizes must be justified on a scientific basis and will depend\non core recovery, the full spectrum of other requests, and the expedition objectives.\nSome redundancy of measurement may be unavoidable, but minimizing the duplica-\ntion of measurements among the Expedition Scientists Party (may include approved\nshore-based collaborators) will be a factor in evaluating sample requests. \nThe minimum permanent archive will consist of one-half of each core taken from the\ndeepest hole drilled at a site (depending on the growth direction of the coral colony,\nif any). As such, the archive halves of cores from additional holes drilled to equal or\nshallower depths that contain replicate copies of stratigraphic intervals constituting\nthe minimum permanent archive need not be designated as permanent archive, but\ncan be, if so desired by the SAC. This may be required, for example, to fill gaps in re-\ncovery in the deepest hole. If not designated as permanent archive, they are \u201ctempo-\nrary archive.\u201d If a composite splice section is constructed and the sampling demand\nexceeds the working half, an alternative scenario may be required to make sure that\nall samples can be taken from the spliced section. In this case, the permanent archive\nwill be defined from cores that are not part of the splice (e.g., from cores from differ-\nent holes). It should be stressed that the availability of archive halves for sampling de-\npends on the presence of comparable sedimentary sequences in adjacent holes that\ncan be directly correlated and thereby identified as duplicate material.

Nevertheless, this plan is subject to amendment accord-\ning to the scientific needs and interests of the Expedition Scientists or operational\nconstraints.\nOffshore Sampling and Analysis\nCore Curation\nThere will be a mobile core curation laboratory container onboard the drilling vessel, su-\npervised by the Chief Curator. A second curator will cover the opposite shift. A sufficient\nnumber of core storage containers will be on the drilling vessel. There will be no splitting\nof the cores at sea, as it will be more efficient to carry out most of the following scientific\nanalysis during an onshore party at Bremen. \nCore on deck \n(1.5 m sections) \nLabel, cap, and seal \nsections \nEach section run \nthrough MSCL \nSubcoring for \nmicrobiology? \nLithological description\nMacropaleontological \ndescription \nSections transferred to \ntemperature-controlled \ncontainer  \nCore catcher sample \nsplitting, sampling, and \nlabeling, photography, storing \nof archive half\nCore catcher \nsample* \nSample from lower end of section if not massive coral* \n* If no core catcher is collected, a sample from the lower end of the section will \nbe taken for shipboard lithological and macropaleontological analysis. If the \nlower end of the section is a massive coral, no sample will be cut off the core.  \nPore water sampling if \nmaterial is suitable47\nExpedition 310 Scientific ProspectusAs the cores will be collected in a plastic liner, the usual IODP curation procedures will be\nfollowed: the core will be cut on board into 1.5 m lengths and curated. It has been noted\nthat it is important to store corals in dry conditions to avoid fungi and bacteria that may\ndevelop in coral skeletons, with the strong possibility of alteration of the initial geochem-\nical signals.\nLithological and Macropaleontological Description\nCore catcher samples will be collected, split, and labeled, and the working half handed\nover for lithological and macropaleontological description. If no core catcher is collected,\na sample from the lower end of the section will be taken for shipboard lithological and\nmacropaleontological analysis. If the lower end of the core is a massive coral, no sample\nwill be cut off the core. \nInorganic Geochemistry\nNo major mud sequences are expected to be encountered at the proposed drill sites. How-\never, if suitable material is recovered and there are requests from Expedition Scientists,\npore water sampling (e.g., by centrifuge) may be conducted for fluid chemistry\/circulation\nstudies. In this case, pore water should be extracted immediately from a core sample, and\nephemeral properties (e.g., salinity, alkalinity, and ammonia) will be analyzed right away.\nDepending on the parameter, the interstitial water sample might be specially treated in or-\nder to conserve it for later analyses. \nMicrobiology \nSampling \nIt is proposed that samples should be taken immediately in the field under the most sterile\npossible conditions. It will be important to know if microbes from the drilling fluids have\nentered the cavities during drilling. Ideally, fluorescent microspheres should be used dur-\ning drilling, but these will not be used during Expedition 310 for environmental reasons.\nResults should be interpreted with care, as contamination may occur during drilling and\nany microbial material found may not be in situ. To limit the effects of contamination,\nsamples will be washed with sterile seawater and only the attached microbes will be con-\nsidered for further activity measurements (which includes typically >99% of the total bio-\nmass).\nFixing for Scanning Electron Microscopy\/Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis\/Light \nMicroscopy Studies\nIt will be important to look for the biofilms in the field using a binocular microscope and\na fluorescence microscope (i.e., to look for living microbes revealed by 4\u2032 ,6-diamindino-\n2-phenylindole [DAPI] staining). Also, counting should be done in the field (but no rou-\ntine counting is required because we expect that the DAPI and acridine orange staining\nmethods are probably difficult to apply in the coral reef environment because of unspecific\nExpedition 310 Scientific Prospectusbinding of the dyes to carbonate minerals). The microbial community should be chemi-\ncally fixed together with the mineral substrate using glutaraldehyde to preserve the pri-\nmary structure, and the samples should be frozen at \u201380\u00b0C to be transported back to the\nlaboratory, where the microbial abundance (shipboard) and diversity (shore based) will be\nstudied microscopically using staining techniques. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)\nand energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) studies of microbial related carbonates (mi-\ncrobialites) will be made postcruise using the fixed samples.\nGrowth Studies\nAppropriate growth media should be inoculated with selected core samples in the field.\nThese will be returned to the laboratory, where the growth of microbes from samples will\nbe studied postcruise. This living material can also be used for deoxyribonucleic acid\n(DNA) analysis.\nActivity Measurements\nOne of the most sensitive tests to detect surface attached microbes (i.e., living cells) is the\nadenosine triphosphate (ATP) test with a luminometer and the firefly-based enzyme assay.\nThe surfaces can be sampled with a specific type of swab, and the numerical results are\navailable within seconds. This method is ideal for routine analysis, in comparison to the\nseveral hours required for the staining\/counting methods (furthermore, we expect that the\nDAPI or acridine orange staining methods will probably be difficult to apply in this envi-\nronment, see above).\nAnother sensitive test (qualitative and quantitative) for microbial activity is the measure-\nment of microbial exoenzymes. We propose to measure alkaline phosphatase, glucosidase,\nand aminopeptidase exoenzymes as detected by fluorometry and compare the data with\nother subseafloor sites described in the literature. This test requires that defined amounts\nof sediment be incubated together with fluorescent dye-labeled substrates in stirred vials\nfor 6\u201312 h and the released dye measured in a spectrofluorometer.\nOffshore Petrophysics Measurements\nCore Logging\nCores will be logged on the drilling vessel in a modified 20 ft container, housing a single\nMSCL track comprising one magnetic susceptibility loop and density, velocity, and resis-\ntivity sensors. The single core-logger system will include a full spares kit.49\nExpedition 310 Scientific ProspectusAll the temperature-equilibrated core logging data acquired at sea will provide quality\ncontrol\/quality assurance checks when compared to repeat measurements planned\nfor Bremen. \nDownhole Logging\nThe following is a generic list of minimum and additional tools, based on formation\nproperties discussed with proponents, and not on operator-based trademark names:\n\u2022 Optical images: millimeter-scale geological description \n\u2022 Acoustic images: centimeter-scale impedance and mesoscale porosity\n\u2022 Spectral gamma logging: U, Th, K, and red algaes \n\u2022 Acoustic velocity logging: VP and VS at 10\u201320 kHz \n\u2022 Induction resistivity logging: pore fluid salinity and porosity \n\u2022 Hydrochemical borehole fluid logging: pressure, temperature, pH, Eh, SP and\nfluid electrical conductivity to identify fluid circulation 50\nExpedition 310 Scientific ProspectusOnshore Sampling and Analysis\nLocation\nAfter due consideration, it has been decided that there will be no splitting of the cores\nat sea.
