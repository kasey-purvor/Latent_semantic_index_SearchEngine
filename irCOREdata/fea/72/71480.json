We apply the criterion to the problem of aligning 50 glacial varve\nfragments and construct a 3000-year surrogate for global temperature.\nSome key words: Aligning time series; Asymptotics; Global warming; Lag estimator;\nLocal least-squares; Varve chronology.\n1\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThe current debate over the possible human induced contributions to rising global temper-\nature values has underscored the need to understand historical climatic variability. Con-\nsequently, there have been attempts to obtain surrogates for temperature that extend over\nlonger intervals of time than current global temperature records that generally go back about\n150 years. These temperatures have risen steeply over the last 25 years and there is a sub-\nstantial rise of about one degree Centigrade over the past 100 years.\nIn order to obtain longer records from a wider array of phenomena with a broader geo-\ngraphic distribution, it is necessary to turn to biological recorders, such as tree-rings and coral\ngrowth bands, and geological recorders, such as glacial varves. Glacial varves are laminated\nsediments that record annual depositional cycles in certain lakes that are fed by glaciers. The\nthickness of each layer represents the amount of silt and sand deposited by a melting glacier\nover a period of one year. In this sense, changes in varve thickness are an indication of yearly\ntemperature changes. Therefore, reconstruction of a record of such thickness changes, known\nas a varve chronology, can be useful as a potential long-term proxy for paleoclimate.\nAs a result of the vagaries of geological depositional and erosional processes, an entire\nglacial varve sequence is seldom found at any particular site and the complete varve chronol-\nogy must be pieced together from different outcrops or drill cores. Figure 1 shows some of the\nlog-transformed varve thickness series collected from sites in Connecticut and Massachussets\nby Antevs (1922, 1928) and Verosub (1979a, 1979b). The Connecticut series, labeled Conn.\nin Fig. 1(a), is a master series of length 871 years, that started at 15,600 years before present\n(BP), as determined by carbon dating, according to Ridge & Larson (1990). The notation\n15,600 years BP means approximately that many years before 1990. The Broadbrook series\nis an individual site and represents those collected by Verosub. There are a total of 50 series\nin the database, 12 from the Antevs paper tapes collected from Connecticut, Massachussets,\n2\nNew Hampshire, New York and Vermont and 28 series collected from the same states by\nVerosub. The series lengths ranged from short series with only 25 years to the 871-year\nmaster Connecticut series. The total time span represented by all series, taken as a whole,\nis 3000 years, and this is the length of the signal that we would like to construct by aligning\nthese 50 time series fragments.\nINSERT Fig. 1 HERE\n2. LAG ESTIMATION FOR TIME SERIES FRAGMENTS\nSuppose {Xt, Yt}t\u22651 is a stationary ergodic time series. Consider the following model where\none observes {Yt; 1 \u2264 t \u2264 n} and {Xt; 1 \u2264 t \u2264 nX}, nX \u2265 n, satisfying\nYt = \u03b2 +Xt+J + \u00b2t, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 n, (1)\nwhere \u03b2 is the unknown location parameter and J , with 0 \u2264 J <\u221e, is the unknown lag. It\nis assumed that J \u2264 nX \u2212 n. We wish to estimate \u03b2 and J . We assume that {\u00b2t; 1 \u2264 t \u2264 n}\nare independent and identically distributed with zero mean and finite variance \u03c32 and that\n{\u00b2t; 1 \u2264 t \u2264 n} are independent of {Xt; 1 \u2264 t \u2264 nX}. Typically, {Xt; 1 \u2264 t \u2264 nX} are taken\nas the observations of the master series whereas {Yt; 1 \u2264 t \u2264 n} is the series to be aligned.\nThe simplified linear model in (1) is motivated by Fig. 1, which shows that the logarithms\nof the series are dominated by fixed differences, with no apparent scale changes. Although\ngeneral correlation methods based on the usual linear regression model and various nonlinear\nmetrics can improve upon the above model in certain cases, as shown in a University of Bergen\ntechnical report by B. Auestad, D. Tjostheim, R. Shumway and K. Verosub, we concentrate\non the simple model here in the development of asymptotics. Note that, for stationarity, we\nwill generally be dealing with increments log Vt\u2212 log Vt\u22121 = log(Vt\/Vt\u22121) of the original varve\nseries Vt.\n3\nAlignment problems occur because the sequences may only match near the beginning or\nend of the master series or because varve sequences will sometimes have extra or missing\nvalues, called insertions and deletions. This difficulty is compounded by the need to consider\na large number of fragments with unknown time delays. R. H. Shumway and K. L. Verosub,\nin a paper at the Clay Varve Chronology Workshop at Trosa, Sweden, in 1993, considered\nminimisation of a local least-squares measure of distance between a target series Xt and a\npotential matching fragment Yt, where the series can be assumed to differ by a constant (Fig.\n1). They proposed the criterion\ns2(j, k) = min\u03b2\n{\n1\nn\nn\u2211\nt=1\n(Yt+k \u2212Xt+j \u2212 \u03b2)2\n}\n, k \u2265 0,\nwith the shift relative to a start point 1 + k on the matching fragment estimated by\nj\u02c6(k) = argminj{s2(j, k)} \u2212 k.\nINSERT Fig. 2 HERE\nFigure 2 shows the local least-squares matching for just four of the 50 segments based on\nthe local least-squares criterion with window-width n = 30. Consistent local matches will\nappear as horizontal straight lines in the (k, j\u02c6(k)) diagram in Fig. 2, where k is the point\non the fragment and j\u02c6(k) is the value on the master series. In Fig. 2(a), there is a strong\nmatch between the first Massachussets series and the Connecticut series at j\u02c6(k) = 450 on the\nConnecticut series. This extends the record beyond the n = 871 years covered by the master\nConnecticut series. In Fig. 2(b), the match is good only for the first segment of the second\nMassachussets series and the estimated start point is j\u02c6(k) = 767 on the Connecticut series.\nIn Fig. 2(c), we see that the first Verosub record, called the Broadbrook series, matches at\nseveral different lags in the diagram, corresponding to possible extra varves; the middle value\nj\u02c6(k) = 153 was assigned for the series since it was difficult to tell exactly where the changes\noccurred. The final match between the 14th Verosub series, called the Will Mansett series,\n4\nshows matches with the second Massachussets series at j\u02c6(k) = 309; 308 indicates a missing\nvarve somewhere between k = 40 and k = 60.\nIn general, many \u2018two-at-a-time\u2019 comparisons were made between the 50 varve sequences\nin order to align them all with the master or target sequences. For example, two other\nMassachussets varve sequences can serve as the target series for points beyond the Con-\nnecticut series and the first Massachussets sequence. In general, many checks need to be\nmade, alternating the specification of the master or target series to check for the possibility\nof negative lags.\nFor the local least-squares criterion, we will show consistency for the estimator j\u02c6(k) and\nasymptotic normality for \u03b2\u02c6 under the assumption that Xt and Yt are stationary ergodic series\ndiffering by white noise.\n3. ON THE ASYMPTOTICS OF LAG ESTIMATION\nIn (1), regressing {Yt; 1 \u2264 t \u2264 n} on {Xt+j; 1 \u2264 t \u2264 n}, first we obtain the jth least-\nsquares estimator of \u03b2, for 0 \u2264 j \u2264 nX \u2212 n, as\n\u03b2\u02c6j = argmin {\nn\u2211\nt=1\n(Yt \u2212Xt+j \u2212 u)2;u \u2208 IR} = Y\u00af \u2212 X\u00afj, (2)\nwhere Y\u00af =\n\u2211n\nt=1 Yt\/n and X\u00afj =\n\u2211n\nt=1Xt+j\/n. Next we estimate the lag J by minimising the\nresidual sum of squares. Therefore, J\u02c6 is defined as\nJ\u02c6 = argmin [\nn\u2211\nt=1\n{Yt \u2212Xt+j \u2212 (Y\u00af \u2212 X\u00afj)}2; 0 \u2264 j \u2264 nX \u2212 n]. (3)\nFinally, we use \u03b2\u02c6J\u02c6 = Y\u00af \u2212 X\u00afJ\u02c6 to estimate \u03b2.\nWe make the following assumptions about the covariance structure of the increment of\nthe stationary process {Xt; 1 \u2264 t \u2264 n}. Define dt,j = Xt+J \u2212 Xt+j, Dt,j = (Xt+J \u2212 Xt+j)2\nand Xt,j = Xt+J \u2212Xt+j \u2212 (X\u00afJ \u2212 X\u00afj), 0 \u2264 t \u2264 n, 0 \u2264 j \u2264 nX \u2212 n.\n5\nCondition 1. For some \u03b41 and \u03b42 such that \u03b41 > \u03b42 > 0, E(XJ \u2212Xj)2 \u2265 \u03b41 for all j 6= J\nand |E(ds,jdt,j)| \u2264 \u03b42 for all s 6= t.\nCondition 2a. We assume that n\u22121\n\u2211nX\u2212n\nj=0,6=J E(XJ \u2212Xj)2 = o(1).\nCondition 2b. We assume that n\u22121\n\u2211nX\u2212n\nj=0,6=J E(XJ \u2212Xj)4 = o(1).\nCondition 3. We assume that\n\u2211nX\u2212n\nj=0,6=J gnj = o(n\n2), where gnj =\n\u2211\n1\u2264s<t\u2264n cov(Dsj, Dtj).\nCondition 4. We assume that nX \u2212 n = o(n).\nConditions 2a, 2b and 3 are the moment conditions in the overlapping zone of the two\nseries. Condition 4 states that the ratio of the numbers of observations in the master series\nand the matching series should be close to one. Note that, in Conditions 2a, 2b and 3, the\nsum can also include j = J since the corresponding summands are zero. However, to keep\nconformity with Condition 1, we prefer to exclude j = J in writing the sum.\nRemark 1. Conditions 1-3 are satisfied when, for example, {Xt; 1 \u2264 t \u2264 nX} are independent\nand identically distributed with zero mean and finite fourth moment. Also, under a finite\nfourth moment assumption on X1, Condition 4 implies Conditions 2a and 2b.\nRemark 2. Conditions 1-3 are satisfied when {Xt; t \u2265 1} is a stationary linear process\nrepresented by\nXt =\n\u221e\u2211\ni=\u2212\u221e\n\u03c8iZt\u2212i,\nwhere {Zt; t \u2208 Z} is a white noise process with finite fourth moment and the sum with respect\nto i is over the set of integers Z with \u2211i |\u03c8i| <\u221e. We assume that E(Zt) = 0, var(Zt) = \u03c32Z\nand E(Z4t ) = \u03b7\u03c3\n4\nZ with 0 < \u03b7 < \u221e. Thus, in particular, our results are applicable to stable\nautoregressive moving average processes. We verify this remark in the Appendix.\nThe first theorem states the consistency of the lag estimator.\nTHEOREM 1. Consider model (1) and suppose that Conditions 1-4 hold. Then, for all \u00b2 > 0,\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e pr(|J\u02c6 \u2212 J | \u2264 \u00b2) = 1.\n6\nThe next result gives the asymptotic normality of \u03b2\u02c6J\u02c6 .\nTHEOREM 2. Consider model (1) and suppose that Conditions 1-4 hold. Then\nn1\/2(\u03b2\u02c6J\u02c6 \u2212 \u03b2)\u2192 N(0, \u03c32),\nin distribution, as n\u2192\u221e.\n4. SMALL SAMPLE PERFORMANCE\nIn this section we report some simulations that indicate that Theorem 1 may be true even for\nmore general combinations of master series and fragment lengths, nX and n, than would be\nimplied by Condition 4. The varve-matching application involves series lengths that depart\nsubstantially from this assumption and so such simulations give more insight into this matter.\nTo examine the performance of the matching procedure for other combinations, we fitted a\nfirst-order moving average to the first differences of the logarithms of several of the varve\nseries,\nxt \u2212 xt\u22121 = wt \u2212 \u03b8wt\u22121\nsay, where the wt were taken as independent and identically distributed normal random\nvariables with variance \u03c32w. In general, we obtained \u03b8 = 0.8 and we used this to generate a\nseries for Xt for use in model (1). Note that the first-order moving average model results from\ntaking the first difference ytj \u2212 yt\u22121,j in our final merging model. In simulating the values of\n{Yt} in (1), we took \u03c32 = 0.25 and \u03b2 = 4. The variance of the first-order moving average\nwas taken as 0.25 so that the equivalent signal-to-noise ratio in the data generated from the\nmodel (1) was unity. Table 1 shows the results from 500 repetitions for each combination\nof nX and n. For convenience in the simulations, the true match between the fragment and\nthe master series used a value of J such that the midpoint n\/2 of the fragment matched the\nmidpoint of the master series nX\/2; alternative placements did not change the results.\n7\nINSERT TABLE 1 HERE\nThe results show that, with the window-width n = 30 in the applications, J\u02c6 is expected to\nperform very well for most values of nX that are in the range of the master series used in this\nstudy. The simulations also show a gradual reduction of the success probability pr(J\u02c6 = J)\nas the length of the master series increases. One can object to the optimistic nature of the\nassumptions, which take the signal as a first-order moving average and draw the noise values\nfrom a normal distribution, but these are sensible for the problem under consideration.\n5. DISCUSSION\nThe primary purpose of aligning the fragments is to reconstruct a long varve record in order\nto obtain a potential surrogate for paleoclimatic temperature. A sensible model that results\nfrom the above matching exercise might be\nYjt = \u03b2j +Xt + \u00b2jt,\nwhere Yjt denotes the logarithm of the varve thickness of the jth fragment and the merged\nlogarithm of the varve signal Xt is a random walk. The observed series Yjt is assumed to start\nat the correct time delay. Estimation of the scale factors and unknown variances \u03c32j = var \u00b2jt,\nas well as the additional variance of the random walk, can be done using the EM algorithm,\nas developed for the missing data case by Shumway & Stoffer (1982). This leads to the\nmerged varve signal in Fig. 3 based on 50 varve fragment series. In the present case, over\n90% of the varve observations are missing.\nINSERT Fig. 3 HERE\nHere we remark that maximising the likelihood of the above model with respect to the\ntime delays as well as the variance parameters and the scale factors would be an alternative\noption to the sequential two-by-two least-squares approach considered in this paper. The\n8\nnumber of additional parameters, 500 times the number of possible delays in this case, made\nthe \u2018two-by-two\u2019 procedure an easier route. It is also probable that the likelihood function\nwill not be identifiable in this highly parameterised approach.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nR.H. Shumway and K.L.

Mukherjee and R. H. Shumway.\nVerification of Remark 2. In this section, we verify that Conditions 1-3 are satisfied when\n{Xt; t \u2265 1} is a stationary linear process represented by\nXt =\n\u221e\u2211\ni=\u2212\u221e\n\u03c8iZt\u2212i,\nwhere {Zt; t \u2208 Z} is a white noise process with finite fourth moment and the sum with respect\nto i is over the set of integers Z with \u2211i |\u03c8i| <\u221e. We assume that E(Zt) = 0, var(Zt) = \u03c32\nand E(Z4t ) = \u03b7\u03c3\n4.

(A3)\nEquation (A2) follows if we note that |\u03b3(k)| \u2264 C1, so that\n\u2211\n1\u2264s\u2264t\u2264n\n\u03b32(t\u2212 s) \u2264 C1\n\u2211\nk\n|\u03b3(k)| <\u221e.\nSimilarly (A3) follows if we note that\n\u2211\ni |\u03c8i\u03c8i+|t\u2212s+J\u2212j|\u03c8i+t\u2212s\u03c8i+|t\u2212s+j\u2212J || \u2264 C\u03b1(t\u2212s).

Also,\nsince {Xt; 1 \u2264 t \u2264 n} is stationary with autocorrelation function {\u03b3(k)}, Condition 1 implies\n11\nthat, for all s 6= t, j 6= J ,\n2\u03b3(|t\u2212 s|)\u2212 \u03b3(|t\u2212 s+ j \u2212 J |)\u2212 \u03b3(|t\u2212 s+ J \u2212 j|) \u2264 \u03b42 < \u03b41 \u2264 2{\u03b3(0)\u2212 \u03b3(|j \u2212 J |)}.\nThis is equivalent to saying that, for all u, v 6= 0,\n2\u03b3(|v|)\u2212 \u03b3(|v + u|)\u2212 \u03b3(|v \u2212 u|) \u2264 \u03b42 < \u03b41 \u2264 2{\u03b3(0)\u2212 \u03b3(|u|)}.\nFor proving Theorem 1, we first summarise several implications of Conditions 1-4 in the\nform of the following Lemma. For its proof, see the technical report by K. Mukherjee and R.\nH. Shumway.\nLEMMA A1. In the model (1) suppose that Conditions 1-4 hold. Then,\nfor all j 6= J, E{n\u22121\nn\u2211\nt=1\nX2t,j} \u2265 (1\u2212 1\/n)(\u03b41 \u2212 \u03b42) = \u03b43n say, (A4)\nnX\u2212n\u2211\nj=0,j 6=J\nE{n\u22122\nn\u2211\nt=1\nX2t,j} = o(1), (A5)\nnX\u2212n\u2211\nj=0,j 6=J\nE(X\u00afJ \u2212 X\u00afj)2 = o(1), (A6)\nnX\u2212n\u2211\nj=0,j 6=J\nvar(D\u00afj) = o(1), where D\u00afj = n\n\u22121\nn\u2211\nt=1\nDt,j. (A7)\nNote that, in (A5)-(A7), the sum can also include j = J since the corresponding summands\nare zero. However, to keep conformity with (A4), we exclude j = J from writing the sum.\nProof of Theorem 1. Since J\u02c6 and J are integer-valued random variables, it is equivalent\nto proving that\nlimpr(J\u02c6 = J) = 1. (A8)\nNote that\npr(J\u02c6 = J) = pr[\nnX\u2212n\u22c2\nj=0,j 6=J\n{\nn\u2211\nt=1\n(Yt \u2212Xt+j \u2212 Y\u00af + X\u00afj)2 \u2265\nn\u2211\nt=1\n(Yt \u2212Xt+J \u2212 Y\u00af + X\u00afJ)2}]. (A9)\nFrom (1) and (2), Y\u00af \u2212 X\u00afJ = \u03b2+ \u00b2\u00af, where \u00b2\u00af = \u2211nt=1 \u00b2t\/n. Hence Yt\u2212Xt+J \u2212 Y\u00af + X\u00afJ = \u00b2t\u2212 \u00b2\u00af.\nAlso, Yt \u2212 Xt+j \u2212 Y\u00af + X\u00afj = \u00b2t \u2212 \u00b2\u00af + Xt,j. Therefore, using \u2211nt=1Xt,j = 0, we obtain from\n12\n(A9) that pr(J\u02c6 = J) = 1\u2212 pr[\u22c3nX\u2212nj=0,j 6=J{\u2211nt=1X2t,j + 2\u2211nt=1 \u00b2tXt,j < 0}] and so, for (A8), it is\nenough to show that\nlim\nnX\u2212n\u2211\nj=0,6=J\npr(n\u22121\nn\u2211\nt=1\nX2t,j + 2n\n\u22121\nn\u2211\nt=1\n\u00b2tXt,j < 0) = 0. (A10)\nChoose c such that (\u03b41 \u2212 \u03b42)\/2 > c > 0. Fix any j 6= J . Then, with \u03b43n = (1\u2212 1\/n)(\u03b41 \u2212 \u03b42)\nas defined in (A4),\npr(n\u22121\nn\u2211\nt=1\nX2t,j + 2n\n\u22121\nn\u2211\nt=1\n\u00b2tXt,j < 0)\n\u2264 pr(|n\u22121\nn\u2211\nt=1\n\u00b2tXt,j| > c\/2) + pr(n\u22121\nn\u2211\nt=1\n{X2t,j \u2212 EX2t,j} < c\u2212 \u03b43n). (A11)\nThis follows because (A11) can be written, with the obvious identifications, as\npr(X + 2Y < 0) \u2264 pr(Y < \u2212c\/2) + pr(X < c)\n\u2264 pr(|Y | > c\/2) + pr{X \u2212 E(X) < c\u2212 E(X)}\n\u2264 pr(|Y | > c\/2) + pr(X \u2212 E(X) < c\u2212 \u03b43n),\nand \u03b43n < E(X) from (A4).\nWe bound the first probability in (A11) by applying Rosenthal\u2019s inequality to the tail\nprobability of the sum of martingale differences; see Corollary 2.1 and Theorem 2.12 of\nHall & Heyde (1980). Rosenthal\u2019s inequality states that, if {Dt; 1 \u2264 t \u2264 n} is a sequence of\nmartingale differences with respect to an increasing filtration {Dt; 1 \u2264 t \u2264 n},Mk := \u2211kt=1Dt\nand p \u2265 2, then there exists a constant C = C(p), such that, for any \u00b2 > 0,\npr(|Mn| > \u00b2) \u2264 pr\n(\nmax\n1\u2264k\u2264n\n|Mk| > \u00b2\n)\n\u2264 C\u00b2\u2212p\n\uf8ee\uf8f0 n\u2211\nt=1\nE|Dt|p + E\n{\nn\u2211\nt=1\nE(D2t |Dt\u22121)\n}p\/2\uf8f9\uf8fb .\nFix j 6= J throughout. Note that, by independence between the X\u2019s and the \u00b2\u2019s, Dt :=\nn\u22121\u00b2tXt,j, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 n, is a sequence of martingale differences with respect to the sigma-field\n13\nDt := \u03c3{Xl,j, \u00b2k; 1 \u2264 l \u2264 t, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 t\u22121}, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 n. Therefore, using Rosenthal\u2019s inequality\nwith p = 2, we obtain\npr(|n\u22121\nn\u2211\nt=1\n\u00b2tXt,j| \u2265 c\/2) \u2264 C1(c)n\u22122{\nn\u2211\nt=1\n(E\u00b22tEX\n2\nt,j) + E(\u03c3\n2\nn\u2211\nt=1\nX2t,j)}. (A12)\nTo bound the second probability in (A11), note that\nn\u22121\nn\u2211\nt=1\n(X2t,j \u2212 EX2t,j)\n= n\u22121\nn\u2211\nt=1\n[{(Xt+J \u2212Xt+j)2 \u2212 E(X\u00afJ \u2212 X\u00afj)2}]\u2212 {(X\u00afJ \u2212 X\u00afj)2 \u2212 E(X\u00afJ \u2212 X\u00afj)2}\n= n\u22121\nn\u2211\nt=1\n(Dt,j \u2212 EDt,j)\u2212 {(X\u00afJ \u2212 X\u00afj)2 \u2212 E(X\u00afJ \u2212 X\u00afj)2}.\nHence,\npr{n\u22121\nn\u2211\nt=1\n(X2t,j \u2212 EX2t,j) < c\u2212 \u03b43n}\n\u2264 pr{n\u22121\nn\u2211\nt=1\n(Dt,j \u2212 EDt,j) < (c\u2212 \u03b43n)\/2}+ pr{(X\u00afJ \u2212 X\u00afj)2 \u2212 E(X\u00afJ \u2212 X\u00afj)2 < (c\u2212 \u03b43n)\/2}.\nNote that, for all large n, there are some c1 and c2, such that 0 < c1 < \u03b43n \u2212 c < c2. Hence\nthe above probabilities are eventually bounded by\npr{|n\u22121\nn\u2211\nt=1\n(Dt,j \u2212 EDt,j)| > (\u03b43n \u2212 c)\/2}+ pr{|(X\u00afJ \u2212 X\u00afj)2 \u2212 E(X\u00afJ \u2212 X\u00afj)2| > (\u03b43n \u2212 c)\/2}.\nIf now we apply Chebychev\u2019s inequality and Markov\u2019s inequality respectively, the sum of the\nabove two probabilities is bounded above by\nC2var(D\u00afj) + C3E(X\u00afJ \u2212 X\u00afj)2, (A13)\nfor some constants C2 and C3. Combining (A12) and (A13), we obtain that (A11) is bounded\nby a constant times\nn\u22122\nn\u2211\nt=1\nE(X2t,j) + var(D\u00afj) + E(X\u00afJ \u2212 X\u00afj)2.\nIf we sum this over j 6= J , (A10) now follows from (A5), (A6) and (A7).\n14\nProof of Theorem 2.

Using (1) and (2), we can easily see that n1\/2(\u03b2\u02c6J\u2212\n\u03b2) = n1\/2\u00b2\u00af and so, by the ordinary central limit theorem, pr{n1\/2(\u03b2\u02c6J \u2212 \u03b2) \u2264 x} \u2192 \u03a6(x\/\u03c3).\n15\n9.
