The technique utilises two longitudinal modes of a single, pulsed laser \ndiode as a dual-wavelength source for grating illumination. Time-division-multiplexed \naddressing of sensor arrays in serial and tree topologies is also demonstrated. \n \n \n \n \n \n 2 \n1 Introduction \nThe fibre Bragg grating (FBG) has demonstrated its potential for use as a sensing \nelement in a variety of optical fibre sensing applications [1,2]. FBG sensors offer a \nnumber of unique advantages over alternative optical fibre sensor types due to their \nlocalised nature and wavelength-encoded operation. In addition, it is possible to write \nmany FBGs along a single fibre length, creating quasi-distributed FBG sensor arrays, \nwhich can be multiplexed in the wavelength, frequency, time and spatial domains. \n \nA number of methods of determining the measurand induced Bragg wavelength shift \nfrom FBG sensors have been demonstrated. These include edge filters [3], volume \nholograms [4], tuneable filters [5], [6], matched receiving gratings [7], and \ninterferometric techniques [8]. In general such demodulation systems employ a source \nwith a broad spectral bandwidth, typically 10 nm -50 nm full width half maximum  \n(FWHM), in conjunction with FBGs each with a narrow spectral width, typically 0.1 \nnm - 0.5 nm. Such schemes have been widely investigated, and a number of \nsuccessful field and application trials have been reported.  \n \nAn alternative approach that has received little attention since it was proposed by \nMorey\n9\n is the use of laser based interrogation of an array of FBGs fabricated with \nidentical centre wavelengths. In this approach the FBG has a broad spectral bandwidth \nin comparison to the source. A potential advantage of using such a demodulation \ntechnique is the reduced complexity, and potentially reduced cost, associated with \nfabricating an array of identical FBGs. \n  \n \n 3 \n2. Principle of operation \nLaser interrogation of FBG sensors is, in essence, a passive filtering technique. Instead \nof employing a broadband optical source and a broad spectral filter to transduce \nmeasurand induced Bragg wavelength shifts into changes in intensity [3], the FBG \nitself is used as a spectral filter, with the measurand induced wavelength shift \ninducing a change in reflectivity at the laser wavelength. \n \nThe principle of the technique is illustrated in Fig.1. The FBG is simultaneously \nilluminated at two wavelengths.  The wavelengths are chosen such that the Bragg \ncentre wavelength, \uf06cB, lies mid-way between them. The FBG acts as a double edge \nfilter, with opposite polarity filtering slopes for the two illuminating wavelengths. \nMeasurand induced perturbations of the FBG result in a change in the intensities of \nthe light reflected at the two wavelengths, the opposite polarity of the filtering slopes \ncausing the magnitude of one component to increase while the other decreases. \nProcessing the separately detected outputs using the following algorithm \n \n \n21\n21\n\uf06c\uf06c\n\uf06c\uf06c\nII\nII\nS\n\uf02b\n\uf02d\n\uf03d       [1] \n \nwhere 2,1I  are the intensities of the reflected components at wavelengths \uf06c1 and \uf06c2 \nrespectively, results in an output that is proportional to the magnitude of the applied \nmeasurand. The output of this algorithm will be linear over a measurand range \ncorresponding to the linear portions of the grating filtering edges. The algorithm also \nprovides a self-referencing mechanism to compensate for source intensity fluctuations \nand down-lead losses; non-measurand induced intensity changes will be present on \n 4 \nboth reflected components, causing the output of the algorithm to remain unchanged. \nModulation of the output power of the laser sources allows an array of FBG sensor \nelements, fabricated at the same centre wavelength, to be addressed using time-\ndivision-multiplexed (TDM). A single pulse of the source produces a comb of \nreflected pulses, the separation of the reflected pulses in time being dependent upon \nthe physical separation of the sensor elements. Each FBG element within the array is \nthen identified by the time of flight of its reflected pulse \n \nThe illuminating wavelengths can be derived from two separate single longitudinal \nmode laser sources. The use of two separate sources requires careful control of the \nlaser drive conditions to maintain a stable wavelength separation, and complicates the \nfibre coupling system. The preferred approach, adopted here, is to use a single source \nthat operates simultaneously at two closely spaced wavelengths. The recently reported \ntwo-longitudinal-mode distributed Bragg reflector laser diode [10] would be an \nattractive candidate for this scheme. However, such a device is not currently \ncommercially available.  It has previously been demonstrated that laser diodes with \nFabry-Perot cavities, operated with pulsed injection currents [11], or under the \ninfluence of feedback levels of as little as \u201360 dB [12], can exhibit spectra dominated \nby two longitudinal modes. Thus, by appropriate choice of operating conditions, low \ncost laser sources could be used as a dual-wavelength source. A discussion of the \ncritical parameters for achieving this operating regime will be discussed in the \nfollowing section.    \n 5 \n2.1 Laser Characteristics  \n \nThe source used was a Sharp laser diode (LT015MDO), operating at a wavelength of  \n830nm with an output power of 30 mW. The injection current supply and \nthermoelectric temperature controller had long term stabilities of \uf0a310 \uf06dA, and  <0.005 \n\uf0b0C respectively. The laser diode was mounted in a laser head equipped with a BIAS-T, \nwhich allowed external modulation of the injection current from 5MHz to 1 GHz. The \nlaser was pre-biased to just below its injection current threshold, to eliminate turn-on \ndelay effects that might modify the temporal profile of the output pulses. Square-wave \nmodulation of the injection current was performed using a pulse generator with a 300 \nMHz bandwidth and 300ps rise\/fall times. The injection current was pulsed at a \nfrequency of 25MHz, with a pulse width of 6ns. Control of the laser bias current, \nmodulation current and temperature, allowed the output of the laser to be tuned such \nthat two longitudinal modes, separated by two cavity modes (~0.6nm), dominated the \nspectrum. Figures 2 and 3 show the dependence of the spectral profile of the laser \noutput upon bias current and operating temperature. The power in the two modes can \nbe equalised by appropriate choice of operating current and temperature. The spectral \nprofile arises through hole-burning effects in the laser cavity [13]. Characterisation of \nthe laser output indicated the observed spectrum to be stable over a number of hours \nand reproducible over a period of greater than one year. Investigation of other laser \ndiodes of the same type showed that they also could be tuned to operate with similar \nspectral profiles [14].  \n \nA potential limitation to the performance is the wavelength shift associated with the \npulsing of the laser (chirp) [15]. This chirp produces an apparent shift in the FBG \n 6 \nwavelength that is indistinguishable from a measurand induced shift. To assess the \nmagnitude of this effect the chirp behaviour of the laser was measured using a path \nlength imbalanced Michelson interferometer. The magnitude of the chirp was found to \nvary as a function of pulse duration, pulse frequency and the amplitude of the \nmodulation current applied. However, under constant operating conditions the chirp \nwas found to be highly reproducible. For the same conditions as used in the sensor \nexperiments described in the next section the magnitude of the chirp was measured to \nbe 1GHz. The effect of the chirp is to produce a constant offset in the value of the \nrecovered measurand. For example, a 1GHz chirp produces an overestimate in the \nmeasured strain of 4\uf06d\uf065. The measurements can be compensated for the effects of chirp \nprovided the characteristics of the laser are known. \n \n2.2 Crosstalk \nThe use of a serial array of FBG sensors with the same centre wavelength results in \ncrosstalk between sensors. A measurand induced change in the FBG centre \nwavelength causes a change in the reflected intensity and a concomitant change in the \ntransmission of the FBG, and thus in the optical power incident upon subsequent FBG \nsensor elements in the array. The amount of light reflected by the FBG sensors located \nnearest to the source will affect the amount of the optical power reaching and being \nreturned from gratings further from the source. The lower the peak reflectivity of the \nFBGs, the smaller the effect. The light reflected from the n\nth\n FBG in a serial array of \nidentical sensors is given by: \n \nIn = Io R (1-R)\n2(n-1)\n       (1) \n \nWhere Io is the power coupled into the fibre and R is the FBG reflectivity. \n 7 \nFor example, for peak FBG reflectivities of 0.1% the difference between the light \nreturned from the tenth FBG in the array when all FBGs are in their quiescent state, \nthat is reflecting 0.05% of the incident power, and when they all have zero reflectivity \nat the laser wavelength, is 0.9%. That corresponds to a crosstalk level of \napproximately 20dB. This is the worst case assuming that no account is taken of the \nvariation of the power returned by the FBGs in the array. However, if we assume that \nthe intensity from each sensor can be measured to 1% then the amount of power \nreturned from each sensor can be compensated for the effect of previous FBGs in the \narray. For example, the intensity reflected from the tenth sensor will be measured to \nan accuracy of 3.1%. Thus the crosstalk is reduced to 3.1%*0.9% equivalent to \n35.5dB. For an array of 25 sensors this increases to 29.2dB and for 100 sensors to \n20.3dB.  \n \nAnother source of crosstalk in a time-division multiplexed serial array of identical \nFBG sensors arises from multiple reflections between FBGs. This can lead to pulses \narriving simultaneously at the detector having undergone a direct reflection from a \nsensor element and also having experienced a number of multiple reflection paths \nbetween FBGs. For low reflectivity FBGs only first order multiple reflections need to \nbe considered. It can be shown that the number of multiple reflection routes, np, that \nhave a significant effect on the crosstalk is [16] \n \n\uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029\n2\n21 \uf02d\uf02d\n\uf03d\nmm\npn  \n( 1) \n \nFor example, for ten FBGs there are 36 different paths for first-order reflections, \ncontributing a crosstalk level of 44.4dB. This increases to 23.1dB for 100 sensors. In \n 8 \nthis scheme, where the measurand changes the reflectivity of the sensors, the limiting \nnoise factor is given by the resolution with which the intensity of each sensor can be \nmeasured and used to adjust the readings from subsequent sensors. For low \nreflectivity sensors the effect of changes in the reflectivity of the sensors on \nsubsequent sensors in the array dominates the crosstalk for sensor numbers up to \napproximately 100. At this point the crosstalk due to multiple reflections becomes \ncomparable. \n \n3. Experiment \nA schematic diagram of the experimental system used to interrogate a serial array of \nFBG sensors is shown in Figure 4. The end of the optical fibre was polished at an \nangle of 8\uf0b0 to reduce feedback effects, and the laser spectrum was observed to be \nunaffected by the insertion of a Faraday isolator. The FBGs were illuminated via a \n3dB coupler, which also provided a return path for the reflected pulses from the FBG \nsensing elements to the detector. The two interrogation wavelengths returned with \neach reflected pulse were spatially separated using a monochromator, and detected on \nindividual avalanche photodiodes (electrical bandwidth 100MHz). An 8-bit digital \noscilloscope\/PC combination was used to display the pulse trains and perform signal \nprocessing. Reflected components were averaged over 20 pulse returns to reduce the \neffects of mode partition noise. The FBGs were mounted on piezoelectrically \ncontrolled translation stages to enable the application of quasi-static extension, and \nthus strain. TDM of the sensor array was achieved by the incorporation of fibre delay \nlines, the return pulse signals from any particular sensor in the array being identified \nby their time of arrival at the detectors. The system was configured such that a portion \nof each pulse from the laser diode was delivered to the monochromator to act as a \n 9 \nreference to monitor the relative intensities in the two longitudinal modes. This could \nbe used to normalise for relative intensity variations, or to act as part of a feedback \ncircuit to adjust the laser\u201fs operating conditions to maintain equal powers. The \nreference pulses were temporally separated from the signal pulses by incorporation of \nfibre optic delay lines. \n \nThe optimum FBGs for this demodulation system would have a linear filtering edge, \nwith bandwidth suited to the strain range likely to be encountered within a given \napplication. Such FBG fibre edge filters [17] were unavailable for this work and two \nalternative FBG configurations were employed to demonstrate the technique. Two \ntypes of FBG sensor were used to evaluate using the technique. \n \nSingle sensor operation was demonstrated using a relatively broad FBG (FWHM \n~0.6nm, reflectivity ~2.5%), the spectrum of which is shown in figure 5. The second \nsensor type consisted of two collocated narrow-band FBGs, written such that their \nhalf-maximum reflectivity wavelengths were separated by ~0.6nm, as illustrated in \nfigure 6. The FBGs were fabricated with reflectivities of approximately 2.5 % and \nFWHM of approximately 0.1 nm, at centre wavelengths 836.2 nm and 837 nm \nrespectively. This \u201edouble\u201f FBG has the same effective bandwidth as the broadband \nFBG but is significantly easier to reproduce. The serial array comprised of three \nsimilar FBGs of this type. FBGs were fabricated in hydrogen loaded Spectran FS \nSMC-AO780B fibre using a tuneable UV source in a configuration that allowed fine \ncontrol of the spectral characteristics of the FBGs [18], necessary to match the FBGs \nto the laser diode\u201fs operating wavelengths. \n \n 10 \n The fibre delay lines were ~1m long, giving a pulse separation of ~10ns. The pulse \nrepetition rate was limited by the bandwidth of the avalanche photodiodes (APD\u201fs). \nHowever characterisation of the source spectral profile showed it to be unchanged \nwhen pulsed at 50MHz and the use of APDs with larger bandwidths would allow \nsensor separation to be halved. \n \n4. Results and Discussion \n \nFigure 7 shows a plot of S, calculated using equation 1, against applied strain for \nsingle sensor interrogation. By fitting a straight line to the linear portion of the graph a \nmeasurement range of \uf0b1180\uf06d\uf065 (micro-strain) with a resolution of \uf0b13.1\uf06d\uf065 (determined \nfrom the noise on individual data points) was obtained. Calibration of the curve \nextends the range to \uf0b1300\uf06d\uf065 , albeit with reduced sensitivity at the extremes.  \n \nFigure 8 is a plot of the results obtained from the multiplexed \u201edouble\u201f FBG sensor \narray. Here, FBG 2 was subject to effective compression, FBG 3 was subject to \nextension, while FBG 1 was not subject to strain. From the plot, a range of \uf0b150\uf06d\uf065 with \na resolution of \uf0b13.4\uf06d\uf065 was obtained. The equivalent temperature sensor based on this \ntechnique, assuming a FBG temperature sensitivity of 5.73 pm\/\uf0b0C, would have a range \nof 35 \uf0b0C, with a resolution of 0.3 \uf0b0C. \n \nAs discussed in section 2.2, low reflectivity FBGs are suitable for use in the serial \narray sensor topology, allowing the number of FBGs addressed to be maximised, \nwhile reducing the crosstalk between sensor elements.  \n 11 \n \nThe use of a different sensor topology such as the reflective tree array removes the \ncross talk imposed constraints on FBG reflectivity, allowing the use of high \nreflectivity FBG sensors. In addition, the two narrow-band FBGs can be written with \narbitrary wavelength spacing, chosen to match the spectral characteristics of the \nsource, making it possible to use laser diodes with different spectral output \ncharacteristics as the interrogating source. The optical configuration employed to \ninvestigate the performance of the tree topology is shown in figure 9. Fibre delay lines \nwere incorporated to separate the returned pulses by 10 ns as shown in figure 10. The \nexperimental procedure adopted was the same as that previously discussed, producing \nthe results shown in figure 11. The results show improved strain resolution, due to the \nreduced crosstalk in the tree configuration.  \n \nThe sensitivity of the sensor output, S, is dependent upon the gradients of the FBG \nfiltering edges. Maximum sensitivity will be obtained from a FBG with equal gradient \nfiltering edges and a FWHM reflection band equal to the separation of the \nilluminating wavelengths. Unequal filtering edge gradients will result in a reduction of \nthe sensitivity. The results presented in figures 8 and 10 show differences between the \ngradients of S obtained from FBG1 and FBG2. This is a result of differences in the \nspectral characteristics of the two FBGs. The use of a phase mask for FBG fabrication \n[19] would produce FBG sensing elements with near identical characteristics. \n \nThe length of the FBG filtering edge limited the measurement range, while mode \npartition noise and the 8bit digitisation limit the resolution. Extended range may be \npossible using FBGs with tailored FBG edges [17,20], while the resolution would be \n 12 \nimproved by the use of 10-bit digitisation. A 2nm long filtering edge [17] would yield \na measurement range of approximately 4000 \uf06d\uf065, which, when combined with 10 bit \ndigitisation, would provide a resolution limit of approximately 4\uf06d\uf065. This is compatible \nwith the requirements of a number of structural monitoring applications. Multi \nwavelength laser sources with larger wavelength separations suitable to allow \ninterrogation of such FBGs have been reported.  Hole burning effects in multi-mode \nlaser diodes have previously been shown to allow operation at two wavelengths \nspaced by upto 3nm[21]. The use of a two-longitudinal-mode distributed Bragg \nreflector laser diode [10] as the illuminating source offers reduced mode partition \nnoise and therefore improved sensor resolution. In addition, two lasers operating at \nsuitably separated wavelengths may be employed, since, as illustrated by figure 9, it is \npossible to derive a reference pulse at each wavelength to compensate for differential \nchanges in the output powers. The availability of laser diodes operating over a wide \nrange of wavelengths offers the potential for multiplexing large sensor arrays using a \ncombination of WDM and TDM. \n \nIt is informative to compare the signal to noise ratio (SNR) offered by the TDM \ntechnique presented here with that of a conventional WDM system based around the \nuse of a broadband optical source and scanning optical filter. It can be shown that, a \nlaser with an output power of 10 mW used in conjunction with a FBG of maximum \nreflectivity 1% (limited by the crosstalk considerations discussed previously) leads to \na reflected signal level that is approximately an order of magnitude larger than that \nprovided by a system employing a broadband source of 1 mW output power, with a \n50nm FWHM, used in conjunction with a FBG of 100% reflectivity and 0.1 nm \nFWHM. The required electrical bandwidths of the two systems are 100 MHz for the \n 13 \nTDM system, and 1MHz for a typical WDM system. Since the SNR is inversely \nproportional to the square root of the bandwidth, the two systems offer comparable \nSNRs.  Laser diodes with higher output powers are readily available, offering \npotentially improved SNR performance. \n \nThe scheme offers a number of advantages over other interrogation techniques. The \nlaser diode source is inexpensive, with relatively high output power. In addition, the \nsource is capable of high frequency modulation, making it ideal for use in TDM \nsystems. Finally, since the FBG sensing elements have identical characteristics, the \nfabrication process for making large sensor arrays is greatly simplified. \n \n5. Conclusion  \nAn intensity-based, self-referenced technique for interrogation of in-fibre Bragg \ngrating sensing elements using a pulsed laser diode source has been presented. Two \ndifferent types of FBG have been used to evaluate the technique and a single sensor \nrange of \uf0b1180\uf06d\uf065 with resolution of \uf0b13.1\uf06d\uf065 has been achieved. Results demonstrating \nTDM addressing of a serial array of three FBG sensors have been presented and \ntechniques to extend the range discussed. \n \nA.Wilson would like to acknowledge an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research \nCouncil (U.K.) studentship. \n \n 14 \n6.
