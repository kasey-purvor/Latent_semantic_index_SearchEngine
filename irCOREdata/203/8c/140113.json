Consequently, partnership has been strongly recommended by academics and\npractitioners alike. Surprisingly, the concept of partnership is only poorly understood. Many\nauthors have identified the advantages that it can bring but far less has been published on the\nattributes of partnership itself. What is known is that partnerships are \u2018close\u2019 relationships\nand thus, the level of relationship closeness is an appropriate angle for exploring supplier\npartnerships. Research was conducted using the Repertory Grid Technique with an\nexploratory sample of 10 managers from 4 German engineering companies. It revealed that\nsupplier partnerships are very different from other forms of relationship and identified 5\ndistinct attributes of partnerships. These findings have a number of implications for both\npractitioners and researchers.\nIntroduction\nIn the current international competitive environment, many manufacturers are focusing on\nsupplier management as a means for achieving long-term competitive advantage. Supplier\nmanagement \u2014 \u201corganising the optimal flow of high-quality, value-for-money materials or\ncomponents to manufacturing companies from a suitable set of innovative suppliers\u201d (Goffin\net al., 1997: 422) \u2014 is crucial for several reasons. Suppliers can have a significant influence\non a manufacturer\u2019s performance, through their contributions to cost reduction, new product\ndesign and enabling the constant improvement of quality (Monczka et al., 1993).\nConsequently, studies of the supply chain have traditionally looked at the physical flow of\nmaterials and products but increasingly they are focusing on the relationships between the\ndifferent organizations involved.\nThere is strong recognition in the practitioner literature of the importance of supplier\nrelationships and the need to establish \u201cpartnerships\u201d has been widely espoused (e.g., Forsyth,\n2001; Fretty, 2001; Kerns, 2000). Rackman (2001: 32) states that \u201csuccessful partnerships are\nabout radically redesigning a business relationship\u2026[and] partnership creates new value that\ncould not be achieved within the existing vendor\/customer roles.\u201d Both suppliers and\nmanufacturers can gain from partnerships and the automotive industry has spearheaded this\nPage 4\ndevelopment. It is often claimed that car manufacturers now work almost exclusively in\npartnership with their suppliers (e.g., Arminas, 2000). Consequently, many recent practitioner\narticles have focused on prescribing how partnership can best be achieved (e.g., Rackham,\n2001; Kador, 2000), or existing relationships strengthened (Kerns, 2000).\nAlthough the importance of supplier management has also been recognised by academics\nand many studies have pointed to the advantages to be gained from partnerships (e.g.,\nMonczka et al., 1993; Lamming, 1993; Helper and Sako, 1995; Carr and Pearson, 1999; Spina\nand Zotteri, 2000), few studies have looked at the real meaning of partnership. Therefore a\ngap exists in previous empirical work; although the importance of partnership is apparent\nalthough its exact nature is less well understood. For example, the definitions of partnership\ntend to focus on what they achieve (e.g., Landeros, et al., 1995), or on relatively vague\nconcepts such as the \u201cmeeting of minds\u201d they represent (Ellram and Hendrick, 1995), rather\nthan identifying specific attributes. In fact, partnership has become a \u201cbuzzword\u201d and as\nBrennan (1997: 768-769) notes, \u201cfashionable managerial expressions are prone to over-use,\nabuse and consequently to devaluation,\u2026, the same fate awaits, or may already have befallen\n\u2018buyer\/supplier partnership\u2019.\u201d\nIn order to address the gaps in the literature, this paper describes research, which\ninvestigated how managers perceive the exact nature of supplier relationships, including\npartnerships. The current study, which is part of a wider programme of research on supplier\nmanagement in Germany, used an innovative approach to studying relationships: the repertory\ngrid technique (which is widely used in psychology). This technique probed purchasing\nmanagers\u2019 understandings of the relationships their companies have with their suppliers. The\nresults are important as they provide a clearer understanding of partnerships and demonstrate\nthe viability of an innovative methodology for investigating supplier relationships. In order to\nplace the research in context, this paper starts with a review of business relationships in\ngeneral, before moving on to cover the specific literature on supplier partnerships. Then the\nrepertory grid methodology, which appears to have been used for the first time in studying\nsupplier management, is discussed. Finally, the results and their implications are presented.\nBusiness Relationships\nIn discussing business relationships either a \u201cvendor\u201d or a \u201cpartner\u201d perspective can be taken\n(Ring, 2000). A vendor perspective is based on a transactional point of view, whereas a\nPage 5\npartner perspective is grounded in a relational standpoint. Many authors treat the terms\nbusiness relationship and alliance synonymously. Both perspectives seem to be valid also for\nalliances (Ring, 2000). A transactional vendor approach represents a loose alliance; a\npartnership perspective is common in a strategic alliance where the alliance is embedded in\nthe strategies of each of the partners (e.g., Koza and Lewin, 2000). So, the form of the alliance\ncan be anything from a loose and informal coalition to a highly sophisticated network of\nformal business partners.\nAlthough strategic alliances are an interesting research field when debating\npartnerships, the discussion in this paper is restricted to business relationships between\nmanufacturers and suppliers in the supply chain. These sorts of relationships are typically\ncalled \u201cbuyer-supplier relationships,\u201d and will be referred to throughout this paper as supplier\nrelationships for short.\nSupplier relationships are a subset of business relationships. At least two parties are\ninvolved in a relationship (Fournier et al., 1998) and they attach a \u201cbusiness-like\u201d character to\nit (Stuart, 1997), in order to create value for each other (Walter et al., 2001). This means that\none party exchanges some \u201cvalue-package\u201d (e.g., consisting of products, services, knowledge,\nmutual goals, trust), which the other side finds worthwhile to compensate in the form of some\nother \u201cvalue-package\u201d (e.g., monetary compensation, long-term relationship, share of\nbusiness). This type of exchange can take various forms in business. For instance, when\ndiscussing relationships in the supply chain, Cooper et al., (1997) introduce an overview (see\nFigure 1) that spans from dyadic (two organisations) to vertical integration of several\ncompanies with the manufacturer being a shareholder in its suppliers and customers (i.e.,\nKeiretsu).\nTake in Figure 1\nGentry (1996) states that partnerships are the foundation on which an effective supply chain\ncan be built. In order to arrive to a fuller understanding of supplier-manufacturer partnerships,\nthe link between the two parties needs to be studied. Hence, the dyadic perspective is a sound\nviewpoint to adopt. Focusing on the dyad is relatively new (Robicheaux and Coleman, 1994)\nand Wilson (1995: 343) concludes: \u201cOur knowledge about relationships is at an early stage.\nWe need to improve our concept definitions.\u201d\nPage 6\nSupplier Partnerships\nPartnership Definitions\nDuring the past decade there has been an increase in research into supplier relationships and\npartnerships. Given this high level of interest, it is not surprising to find that more than ten\ndifferent attributes of partnership have been identified (see Table 1).\nTake in Table 1\nWhat is surprising is that previous definitions of partnership differ widely in the attributes\nthey include. For example, Brennan (1997) sees partnership in terms of dependency between\nthe two parties. While Ellram and Hendrick (1995) define partnership as a relationship\nbetween two firms which involves a commitment over an extended period of time, the sharing\nof information, as well as the risks and rewards of the relationships.\nDefinitions of partnership in the literature often exhibit the following characteristics:\n\uf0b7 They are vague and rarely include measures (of the degree of partnership), which could\nhelp in operationalising the concept (e.g., Landeros et al., 1995).\n\uf0b7 Where measures are included in definitions, these are based on the authors\u2019 perceptions,\nand are not empirically tested (e.g., Ellram, 1995).\n\uf0b7 Different definitions from different research show inconsistency, which suggests that\ndifferent attributes are measured.\n\uf0b7 Where definitions identify partnership attributes, these are usually based on very limited\nempirical evidence.\nOn the whole, partnerships can be characterised by a high level of commitment, mutual\ndependency, trust, and a long-term orientation where the sharing of information as well as\nrisks and rewards are typical. However, a consistent definition of partnership based on\nempirical evidence cannot be found in the literature and no commonly accepted theoretically\nderived definition yet exists.\nPage 7\nThe Nature of Partnerships\nThe relationship between manufacturers and suppliers can take many forms (Webster, 1992).\nThis can be seen on a continuum ranging from purely discrete transactions at one end, to long-\nterm relational exchanges between interdependent partners at the other (Mohr and Nevin,\n1990). Webster\u2019s representation of this range is shown in Figure 2.\nTake in Figure 2\nWebster suggests that there is only one type of partnership. However, Lambert et al., (1996)\npropose that there are three kinds, depending on their \u201cshort-term\u201d (Type 1), \u201clong-term\u201d\n(Type 2) and \u201clong-term with no-end\u201d (Type 3) character (see Figure 3).\nTake in Figure 3\nSubstantial resources are required to successfully manage long term relationships (Dwyer et\nal., 1987; Simpson and Mayo, 1997). Although it is helpful to use the time dimension to\ndifferentiate between partnership types (as Lambert et al., have), in practice, it cannot be\nassumed that a manufacturer and a supplier in a long-term relationship see themselves in\npartnership. It could be that the manufacturer has purchased the product from the supplier\nover several years due to a consistently low price. Their relationship may not go anywhere\nbeyond the placing of an order and its delivery. Partnerships are a special form of supplier-\nmanufacturer relationship; they are much closer than other forms and a deeper analysis than\nthat of simply the time dimension.\nPartnerships as a Close Form of Relationship\nLambert et al., (1996) contend that partnerships are \u201ccloser\u201d than other types of relationships,\nand Ellram (1991) defines partnerships similarly in terms of \u201cclose sharing relationships.\u201d\nSimilarly, Macbeth (1998) perceives partnerships as contrasting strongly with \u201cdistant\nrelationships.\u201d\nAccording to Ford (1984), manufacturers and their suppliers now emphasize close\nrelationships, rather than \u201cplaying the market,\u201d where they focused solely on cost reduction.\nFord also suggested that relationship closeness could be explained in terms of 5 dimensions:\nPage 8\ngeographical, time1, technological, cultural, and social. In contrast, Kalwani and Narayandos\n(1995) make the point that the level of closeness may indicate the presence of nothing more\nthan joint action and expected continuity of the relationship.\nHomburg (1995) argued that a clear definition of relationship closeness and a way of\nmeasuring the degree of closeness are lacking. He conducted about 30 qualitative interviews\nin various industry sectors and concluded that \u201ccloseness\u201d between suppliers and industrial\nbuyers can be enhanced in terms of four dimensions: 1) product, service, and logistics; 2)\nsupplier interaction; 3) supplier\u2019s commitment; and 4) atmosphere. Unfortunately, he did not\nexplain how he analysed the interviews and derived the dimensions. In addition, it is not clear\nto what extent his results may be generalised.\nMonitoring Supplier Relationships\nTraditionally, three measures have been used for determining supplier performance: price,\ndelivery and quality (Smith et al., 1963) and these are also typically used in selecting\nsuppliers (Weber et al., 1991; Holmlund and Kock, 1996). Today, however, it is argued that\nfocusing mainly on price is inappropriate as it is \u201cperhaps one of the most defined\ncharacteristics of primitive purchasing\u201d (Lamming, 1993: 148). Lamming did not suggest that\nprice is irrelevant, but the relative emphasis between the traditional factors has changed over\ntime and other factors might be more important. Thus, in addition to quality, delivery and\nprice a manufacturer looks to their suppliers for design expertise and other capabilities\n(Pearson and Ellram, 1995). In this vein, both Kolay (1993) and Monczka et al., (1995) stress\nthat it is essential to identify and audit the strategic capabilities of potential suppliers, such as\ntheir ability to contribute to product development.\nIn the literature a move from the three criteria used in traditional purchasing towards\nthe more comprehensive set of criteria in modern supplier management is evident and Table 2\nillustrates this change. The table shows that the criteria used for selecting and monitoring\nsuppliers in traditional approaches to purchasing were unit price (first), followed by quality\nand speed of delivery. Price has often been the criterion given the most emphasis. While,\nquality tended to be looked at from the conformance point of view, i.e., if the supplier\u2019s\nquality simply met the current required level, it was acceptable. Current thinking proposes a\nwide set of criteria and so, monitoring and selecting suppliers became more complicated in\n1 The length of the relationship.\nPage 9\nthe supplier management approach. In this complexity, the supplier relationship plays an\nessential part.\nTake in Table 2\nJust as the role of price has diminished in evaluating supplier performances in many\nsectors, quality has become a more critical factor. However, quality no longer simply applies\nto the product itself but also to the service and other aspects of the supplier-manufacturer\nrelationship. For instance, a good relationship is a prerequisite to good problem solving and\nco-operation in product design. However, empirical evidence is lacking whether\nmanufacturers really use the wider list of factors (indicated in the right-hand column in Table\n2) in their selection of suppliers and monitoring of performances.\nPrevious Studies \u2013 Methodological Issues\nThe various approaches to partnership research which have previously been used can be\ncategorised as follows:\n\uf0a7 Single informant: researchers often rely on the information of one individual within\neach company. Yet, a multiple respondent approach is more beneficial (Tanner, 1999;\nStuart, 1997) as \u201cindividual parties to a relationship tend to have somewhat unique\nperspectives on the ongoing interaction, resulting in part from their particular positions\nin the exchange network\u201d (Heide and John, 1992: 39). It is not surprising that individual\nmanagers perceive the partnership construct differently (see New and Payne, 1995 for a\ndiscussion about the methodological problems of logistics research).\n\uf0a7 Quantitative studies: researchers typically approach the field (usually investigating it\nusing a postal survey) with a preconceived view about partnerships (e.g., Ellram and\nHendrick, 1995; Mudambi and Schr\u00fcnder, 1996; Saxton, 1997). In this way scholars do\nnot uncover the attributes of partnerships as they miss capturing the views of the experts\nin the field, i.e., the practitioners.\n\uf0a7 The issue of \u201ccloseness\u201d is overlooked: Although authors agree that partnerships are\nclose relationships, they do not use relationship closeness as the starting point for their\ninvestigations (e.g., Ellram, 1991; Saxton, 1997).\n\uf0a7 Scope too wide: Exploratory studies are typically based on a cross-industrial sample\n(e.g., Anderson and Narus, 1990), neglecting that managers\u2019 views might be coloured\nPage 10\nby the industrial context, organisational sizes, etc. For example, supplier-wholesaler\nrelationships may differ to those between suppliers and manufacturers (Weitz and Jap,\n1995). Although cross-industrial samples would allow investigating the different\nresearch contexts, the sample sizes of each sector are often too small.\nConclusions on the Literature\nThere are four main conclusions to be drawn from the literature:\n1) Supplier partnerships are increasingly important, although the concept itself is poorly\nunderstood.\n2) There is some consensus concerning the nature of partnerships; they are generally\nrecognised as close business relationships. However, although researchers are in\nagreement that the degree of relationship closeness is a good angle for exploring\npartnerships, this approach has not previously been operationalised.\n3) Many researchers explore partnerships using a postal questionnaire, which does not\nprovide the opportunity to look at the concept in detail.\n4) Most previous investigations of partnerships tend to focus on the purchasing manager\n(and director). However, while the purchasing executive might be in the best position\nto respond, a multiple respondent approach (e.g., purchasing, quality management,\nvice-president operations) might be necessary to present a wider picture.\nMethodology\nFrom the literature, it is clear that there is a real need of an empirical study of the attributes of\nmanufacturer-supplier partnerships. The key research question for this exploratory study was\n\u201cwhat are the main attributes of supplier-manufacturer relationships (including\npartnerships)?\u201d Various methods could have been used to answer this question but, as\nmentioned earlier, the term partnership has been used so extensively that it is becoming\ndebased (Brennan, 1997). Consequently, a survey approach would not be effective in\nobtaining unbiased views from managers. Relationships are a relatively complex topic and so\nit is crucial to probe their meaning and move beyond managers\u2019 views that are based on\nclich\u00e9s, such as \u201cour supplier relationships are based on partnerships.\u201d Therefore, face-to-face\ninterviews were used so that managers\u2019 views could be studied in-depth. However, a problem\nPage 11\nremained: would reliable, meaningful answers be obtained to direct questions, such as \u201cwhat\nsort of relationships do you have with your suppliers?\u201d Pilot investigations, as part of an\nearlier programme of research (refer to Szwejczewski et al., 2001), had shown that such\nquestions inevitably elicited \u201cbuzzwords\u201d and little detailed understanding. Clearly a different\nmethodology was required and repertory grid technique was chosen, as it is a powerful\nresearch tool for probing interviewees\u2019 understanding of complex topics.\nRepertory Grid Technique\nThe technique is particularly useful for exploring topics where interviewees find it hard to\narticulate their opinions and experiences with clarity (Hussey and Hussey, 1997; Goffin,\n2002). Kelly (a mathematician by training who later qualified and worked as a clinical\npsychologist) developed the technique in the 1950s. It is based on his central belief that\neveryone, consciously or sub-consciously, develops categories to explain all of the situations\nthey face. The repertory grid technique enables such categorisations to be identified during an\ninterview. The name repertory grid does not come from \u201crepetition,\u201d but from the fact that the\ntechnique probes an individual\u2019s \u201crepertoire\u201d of categorisations for the range of situations,\nphysical entities, etc. that they have encountered. This repertoire is captured in a grid that will\nbe explained later in greater detail. Originally, the technique was used to explore how patients\nviewed their relationships with friends and their families and it \u201cis an attempt to stand in\nothers\u2019 shoes, to see their world as they see it\u201d (Fransella and Bannister, 1977: 5).\nTo understand the technique, consider a repertory grid interview investigating working\nrelationships. The interviewee would be asked to name some colleagues with whom they\nwork. These could be called colleagues A, B, C, D, E and F, for instance. The colleagues are\ntermed the elements of the test and each name is written on a separate postcard-sized card.\nAfter the cards have been annotated with the colleagues\u2019 names, the interviewee is presented\nwith a random set of three cards (termed a triad). As the triad is presented, the interviewee is\nasked, \u201cwhy is working with two of these colleagues similar and different from working with\nthe third?\u201d A typical response \u2014 termed a construct \u2014 could be that two of the people were\n\u201ceasy to work with,\u201d whereas working with the third \u201cis difficult.\u201d The way in which the\ninterviewee differentiates between the elements in the triad reveals one aspect of how working\nrelationships are viewed. In this vein, Kelly (1955a, 1995b, 1963) defined a construct as, \u201ca\nway in which two or more things are alike and at the same time different from one or more\nPage 12\nthings.\u201d Each of the interviewee\u2019s elements (colleagues) is then rated against this first\nconstruct, usually on a 5-point scale (with 1 defined as maximum and 5 as minimum).\nFurther triads are used to identify \u2014 \u201celicit\u201d in repertory grid terminology \u2014 further\nconstructs. The interviewee is not allowed to repeat a construct and so each new triad elicits at\nleast one new construct, which forces the interviewee to think deeply about working\nrelationships. Following each construct, the interviewee is required to rate the elements\nagainst it using the same 1-5 rating scale. These ratings form the repertory grid, as shown in\nFigure 4.\nTake in Figure 4\nIn Figure 4, the six elements of the test are shown across the top of the grid. Down the side of\nthe grid are the constructs elicited during the interview. The randomly selected first triad\nconsisted of Elements B, E, and D and this is indicated with asterisk signs in the grid. Many\ndifferent triads can be presented, however, it is advisable to select only card combinations\nwhere at least two elements will be changed between each triad, as this is important to obtain\nmeaningful constructs (Bender, 1974). In addition, limiting the number of triads reduces the\nrisk of fatiguing the respondent.\nIt can be seen that the Colleague B is rated as \u201c1\u201d (easy to work with) but Colleague D\nis difficult to work with and received a rating of \u201c5\u201d. The ratings indicate not only how\ninterviewees view their colleagues; they also give information on the importance of particular\nconstructs. For example, the ratings on the construct experienced are not as widely spread\n(they only range from 1 to 2) as those for clever, quick (where the ratings range from 1 to 5).\nThis shows that the latter construct differentiates more strongly between the elements.\nOverall, the repertory grid technique involves identifying suitable elements, eliciting\nconstructs and obtaining the ratings (Gammack and Stephens 1994). In total, the constructs\nand the explanations provided by respondents, together with the ratings, form a rich pool of\nqualitative and quantitative data.\nApplying the Technique to Supplier Management\nIn understanding supplier relationships from the manufacturer\u2019s perspective, suppliers were\nthe elements in the repertory grid interview. Interviewees were asked to name nine suppliers\nwith whom their companies regularly conduct business. To cover a range of different\nrelationships, the interviewees were asked to name three suppliers with whom they had close\nPage 13\nrelationships, three distant and three average relationships. This approach ensured that the\nchoice of elements (i.e., suppliers) was meaningful to the participant, which was important for\nthe technique to work effectively (Tindall, 1994). It also avoided the possibility of the\nresearcher introducing any bias by asking the interviewees to talk directly about the suppliers\nwith which they had a partnership.\nThe name of each supplier was written on a separate card, which had been pre-\nnumbered in a random sequence. The sequence was 5, 1, 8 (for close relationships i.e.\npartnerships); 6, 9, 4 (for average relationships); and 7, 2, 3 (for distant relationships), which\nenabled the selection of random groups of cards (Goffin, 2002). When a triad was presented\nto the respondent, they were asked, \u201cin what way are two suppliers similar and different from\nthe third in terms of the relationship you have with them?\u201d Therefore, each triad was used to\nelicit constructs, i.e., how interviewees perceived their relationships with suppliers and each\nconstruct was expressed in the form of a word or a phrase, whatever came most naturally to\nthe respondent (Levy and Dugan, 1956). A typical construct was \u201clevel of relationship\nmaintenance,\u201d i.e., how well the supplier was perceived to maintain the relationship with the\nmanufacturer. In short, the interviews identified a range of constructs, describing the\nmanufacturers\u2019 relationships with their suppliers.\nThe interviews were recorded so that close attention could be paid to the respondents\u2019\nown explanations (Charmaz, 1995). As each construct was identified, further questions were\nused to probe its meaning so as to achieve the \u201cproduction and maintenance of [a] mutual\nunderstanding\u201d (Drew, 1995: 77).\nAfter each construct was elicited, each of the elements (suppliers) was then rated on the\n1-5 (perceptional) scale, as recommended by Tindall (1994) and Gammack and Stephens\n(1994). In the study, the scale anchors were very good (1), neutral (3) and very poor (5). The\nrating exercise indicates the relative importance of constructs while at the same time\nexplaining the differences of supplier relationships.\nThe analysis of repertory grids was based on both the verbal explanations of constructs\n(i.e., attributes) provided by interviewees and from the numbers in the resulting grids (Smith,\n1986; Goffin, 1994; Goffin, 2002).\nSample\nThe repertory grid interviews formed part of a larger programme of research into supplier\nmanagement at German manufacturing companies and was linked to the International Best\nPage 14\nFactory Awards programme. This programme, which provides a benchmarking service for\ncompanies in Germany, Italy and the UK, has created a comprehensive database on\nmanufacturing performance (New and Szwejczewski, 1995). This database has been used for\na wide range of investigations of manufacturing performance (e.g., New et al., 1998a,b;\nGoffin et al., 2000), including previous studies of supplier management (Goffin et al., 1997;\nLemke et al., 2000). Typically, the database has provided detailed background information\nthat has been used to select companies for further research.\nAs an exploratory sample, nine companies were selected from the Engineering sector\nin the German database. These were companies that had entered the awards programme in\n1997 and had co-operated with earlier supplier management research (see Szwejczewski et\nal., 2001).\nIt can be argued that manufacturers dominate the relationship with their suppliers,\nsince they select suppliers and place orders. For this reason, the research at this stage\nexclusively focused on the views of managers involved in supplier management from the\nmanufacturer\u2019s side. Taking a dyadic approach and contrasting the views of manufacturers\nwith those of suppliers would be a fertile area for further research.\nNine German companies were contacted and four agreed to participate in the research.\nAt two companies, two managers were interviewed and at the remaining two firms three\nmanagers took part in the study. All ten interview respondents were responsible for\npurchasing or supplier management in their organisations. The repertory grid interviews took\napproximately 40 minutes per manager and were conducted in the year 2000.\nResults\nFrom the 10 repertory grid interviews, 37 constructs (i.e., attributes of partnership) emerged.\nAlthough a detailed individual analysis of each repertory grid is possible (an example is\npresented later), the key issues are the exploration of the constructs of supplier relationships\nacross all respondents as well as in identifying the most important constructs of partnership.\nBoth will be outlined.\nRelationship Constructs\nTable 3 shows the Top-20 most frequently mentioned constructs (from a total of 37).\nPage 15\nTake in Table 3\nThe frequency count necessary for identifying a \u201cCommon Construct\u201d is left open for\ninterpretation in the repertory grid literature. The decision was taken that a construct that has\nbeen mentioned by at least 25% of the respondents (i.e., by 3 or more) carries more\nimportance in explaining supplier relationships than constructs that have been mentioned by\nfewer. The constructs that fulfil the requirement range from personal business relationship\n(i.e., personal vs. pure business-like) to openness (i.e., very open vs. indirect and diplomatic)\nand these have been indicated in grey in Table 3.\nThe results presented in the table suggest that the classic differentiators of delivery\nperformance and quality are still important in supplier relationships. Somewhat surprising, the\nprice was mentioned only by two respondents, indicating its low priority for the respondents\nwhen describing supplier relationships. Recent research in German manufacturing has shown\nthat all three factors (delivery, quality and price) are frequently used as key measures of\nsupplier performances and in selecting suppliers (Lemke et al., 2000). Aside from the three\nclassic differentiators, the repertory grid technique was able to uncover additional constructs\nof relationships such as flexibility, location and complaint handling. Nevertheless, does the\nfrequency of all factors explain supplier partnerships sufficiently? The Top-20 relationship\nconstructs have been further analysed with this question in mind.\nMost Important Partnership Constructs\nA construct\u2019s frequency count is a good indication of its importance. However, it does not\nuncover the relative importance of the constructs to the respondents as it ignores the values of\nthe repertory grids (i.e., the rating of the elements against each construct). This means that in\nthe frequency table (Table 3) common constructs are included which do not have the power to\ndifferentiate between close, average, and distant relationships (the three supplier groups used\nin the repertory grid technique). The relative importance of a construct can be quantified by\ndetermining its variability. The variability of a construct is a measure of the spread of its\nratings (in the evaluation process) compared to all the other constructs. The higher the\nvariability of a construct is the greater is its importance to the respondent.\nThe variability of each construct was calculated using FlexiGrid 6. This software\npackage is the standard tool used for analysing repertory grid data. It computes a variability\nindex in terms of the percentage of the total variance for each respondent. The variability of a\nPage 16\ngiven construct represents its contribution in explaining the total variance. It is therefore\ndependent on the number of constructs produced by a respondent. If all the constructs can\nexplain the total variance equally, the variability for each construct would be the same. For\ninstance, if a respondent mentions 5 constructs, the average variability would be 20 (i.e., 100 \/\n5). If the respondent mentions 10 constructs, the individual variability of each of constructs\nwould be 10 (i.e., 100 \/ 10). The variability index of a given construct is therefore higher in a\nset of 5 constructs than among 10, although the same ratings may have been used. In a set of\n10, a given construct has to \u201ccompete\u201d against more constructs when explaining the total\nvariance. This means that individual variability indexes cannot easily be compared across all\nthe respondents, as the number of mentioned constructs is not the same; some respondents\ncould mention 5 constructs, others 10 etc.\nTherefore, in order to arrive at a comparable base across all respondents in this study,\nthe variability of each construct was weighted by the average number of constructs (10.2 in\nthis research). In other words, the variability values have been normalised as if they all came\nwith the same number of constructs (see Table 4).\nTake in Table 4\nTaking 10.2 constructs as the standard per interviewee, the average variability index was 9.8\n(i.e., 100 \/ 10.2). A construct with an index greater than 9.8 means that the construct\ndifferentiates more clearly between the three supplier groups (i.e., close, average, and distant),\nwhile a construct with an index less than 9.8 indicates that the three supplier groups \u201cscored\u201d\nalmost equally on it. In short, a construct with a low variability index is not particularly\nimportant when explaining supplier partnerships, because it accounts only for a small\nproportion of the total variance in the data. The constructs that are above average in\nimportance are highlighted in grey in Table 4.\nAs shown in Table 4 the constructs volume of turnover to feedback clearly\ndiscriminate between relationship types (i.e. have variability from 14.8 to 9.9 in grey). The\nmanagers interviewed consider the constructs complaint handling down to price less\nimportant in differentiating between supplier relationship types. However, only two managers\ndifferentiate partners from other supplier relationships with Volume of Turnover. It is thus not\na common construct, albeit, it is important for the two managers of the sample.\nPage 17\nTo sum up, two basic requirements help in identifying the most important constructs\nof partnership across the sample: 1) A sufficient number of respondents identify these\nconstructs; and 2) the construct has the power to differentiate between the three relationship\ngroups (as represented by its variability index). Five factors fulfil both requirements; these are\nthe key partnership constructs and are highlighted in bold in Table 4. Supplier partnerships\ncan thus be characterised as follows:\n\uf0b7 The personal business relationship is very well developed on a personal level rather\nthan being purely at the business level (i.e., merely take the order and then deliver\nproducts).\n\uf0b7 The partner supplies a special product, typically tailor-made for the manufacturer.\n\uf0b7 The partner contributes in the new product development process.\n\uf0b7 The supplier partner is capable of active relationship maintenance in terms of company\nvisits and a regular telephone contact.\n\uf0b7 The supplier\u2019s location nearby not only for interaction purposes, but also to ensure\nspeedy deliveries.\nBy contrast, the low variability values for quality, delivery performance, and price suggests\nthat partnerships do not differ from normal business relationships in terms of these classic\ncriteria.\nIn addition, each repertory grid has been analysed with the statistical packages FlexiGrid 6,\nWebGrid II and SPSS 10. A typical Principle Component Analysis (PCA) output is shown in\nFigure 5:\nTake in Figure 5\nPCA generates a map of the personal constructs of a given respondent and present this, in\ntwo-dimensional component space. This space consists of two axes (termed \u201ccomponents\u201d),\nwhich is based on the correlations between elements (i.e., suppliers) and constructs (i.e.,\nrelationship attributes). These correlations are often referred to as \u201cfactor loadings\u201d and PCA\nvisualises to what degree a given construct loads on, or correlates with a given component.\nPut differently, the level of correlation is indicated by how closely the construct poles are\nlocated to the component axes.\nPage 18\nThe example in Figure 5 shows that the Component 1 and Component 2 we derived\nfrom the 12 constructs elicited and the circle is annotated with the poles of the respondent\u2019s\nconstructs. The constructs \u201ccustomer importance,\u201d2 \u201cpersonal relationship,\u201d3 and\n\u201cseriousness\u201d4 (numbers 4, 10 and 11) have very strong correlation with Component 1,\nwhereas only the \u201cprice\u201d5 (construct 7) strongly correlates to Component 2. The component\nmap shows that the interviewee\u2019s perception of supplier relationships is largely explained by\nthe four constructs most closely related to the two components. It furthermore illustrates that\nthe level of Seriousness to the business, A-Customer classification, and a Personal\nRelationship are closely associated with each other from the respondent\u2019s viewpoint.\nThe two components explain about 78% of the total variance and provide the co-\nordinates on which the nine suppliers can be located on the map (in relation to all constructs).\nIt can be seen that the \u201cpartnership group\u201d (i.e., supplier number 1, 5, 8) differ greatly from\n\u201cdistant suppliers\u201d (i.e., 2, 3, and 7). The \u201caverage suppliers\u201d (i.e., 4, 6, 9) are between these\ntwo extremes. In Figure 5, partnership supplier 8 is characterised by active relationship\nmaintenance, commitment, involvement in new product development processes, a relationship\non a personal level, and delivers special tailor-made components. By contrast, the respondent\ndescribes a distance relationship, for instance supplier 3, as a large cooperation that delivers a\nlow volume of standard components.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nResearch into partnerships is an important topic for both academics and practitioners alike.\nWhile, the notion of supplier partnerships is often discussed in the literature, there has been\nlittle empirical work carried out to identify the attributes of partnerships in the supply chain.\nThe research covered in this paper addressed this omission by examining the German\nengineering sector.\nBased on the findings, it is possible to empirically differentiate between common\nattributes of relationship and those of partnership (see Figure 6). This shows sets of attributes,\nSet 2 contains all of the attributes of supplier relationships that were empirically identified by\nthis study, for example, volume of turnover, organisational size, quality, and price. Some of\n2 The construct \u201cCustomer Importance\u201d represents how the manufacturer perceives to be classed by its supplier. Only the\nrespondent in the example has mentioned this construct and the two poles are A-Customer and C-Customer.\n3 The two poles of the construct \u201cPersonal Relationship\u201d are Personal Relationship and Pure Business Relationship.\n4 \u201cSeriousness\u201d has the two poles Serious and Questionable and has been mentioned only by the respondent in the example.\n5 The two poles of the construct \u201cPrice\u201d are Higher Price and Lower Price.\nPage 19\nthese have already been anecdotally identified in the extant literature (see overlap of Set 1 and\n2). However, certain factors such as trust and dependency (refer to Tables 1 and 2) were\nmentioned in the literature but were not verified in this empirical study (see Set 1). From\nFigure 6, it can be seen that 5 attributes (personal business relationship, special product, new\nproduct development, relationship maintenance, and location nearby) help to differentiate\npartnerships as a special type of supplier relationships (see Subset 3).\nTake in Figure 6\nOverall, Figure 6 shows that the classic factors of delivery performance, quality and\nprice are important in supplier relationships (see Table 3), which confirms the findings of\nprevious research (Lemke et al., 2000).\nIn the following, the analysis disclosed which relationship constructs have the power\nto discriminate between partnerships and other forms of supplier relationships. It is striking\nthat delivery performance, quality, and price are low ranking when it comes to explaining\npartnerships (refer to Table 4). This means that all suppliers, irrespective of whether they are\npartners or not, have to fulfil these basic requirements. The three constructs have merely\nbecome hygiene factors that manufacturers expect to find when dealing with all suppliers.\nInterestingly, partners go beyond the basic requirements and clearly excel with regard to the\npersonal business relationship they have with the manufacturer. Moreover, they deliver\nhighly specific products to the manufacturer and are involved in the new product development\nprocesses. They are capable of relationship maintenance actively and are typically located\nwithin close range of the manufacturer. The importance of the latter construct partly supports\nFord\u2019s (1984) impression that closeness can be measured in terms of geographical distance\n(beside other dimensions).\nThe results of the research have implications for researchers, who need to capture a fuller\nunderstanding of supplier partnerships. Rather than defining a partnership concept before\nembarking on data collection, it seems more sensible to first explore the attributes of\npartnerships (i.e., constructs) via a qualitative research approach.\nIt is surprising to find that trust and commitment were not identified as key partnership\nattributes by the managers interviewed (Morgan and Hunt, 1994; McCutcheon and Stuart,\n2000). It is possible that the findings apply only to the engineering industry and so cannot be\ngeneralised beyond it. Therefore, it would be fruitful to explore how trust and commitment\nPage 20\nrelate to supplier partnerships in other industry sectors. Also, do manufacturers treat\npartnerships differently and if so, in what ways? A partnership needs a more resource-\nintensive supplier management approach. What is the \u201creturn on partnership investment\u201d as\ncompared to other forms of supplier relationships? Also, how would a supplier describe the\npartnership with the manufacturer? Are the factors similar or radically different? In what way\ndo partnership factors influence the way suppliers are being selected? Does the subjective side\ncome into supplier selection at all (e.g., personal relationship vs. pure business-like)? Finally,\nsome manufacturers appear not to establish supplier partnerships with larger organisations \u2013\nwhy is this the case? Does power-imbalance inhibit the development of partnerships?\nThe findings also have ramifications for suppliers; offering high quality products, on-time\nfor a reasonable price is an outdated order qualifier. In short, the three classic factors are not\nthe key elements for developing a partnership any more. With this is mind, suppliers need to\nrevise their competitive strategy not only to ensure they are selected, but also to be promoted\nto the partnership status. In order to be attractive to a manufacturer as a potential partner,\nsuppliers need to ensure that they are able to offer specialised parts, have an excellent new\nproduct development capability and be good at relationship maintenance.\nAccording to Friedrich et al., (1995), partnerships are not commonly found in Germany. In\ncontrast, the current research has shown that partnerships do exist in Germany and these can\nclearly be distinguished from other forms of supplier relationships. The contrary finding of\nFriedrich et al. might be explained by the fact that the partnership constructs are more clearly\ndefined today.\nAn interesting area for further research would be to investigate if manufacturers have\nadapted their supplier management approach to deal with partners. It would be interesting to\nsee whether this special form of supplier relationship is managed in a more sophisticated way,\nbecause supplier partnerships irreducibly are important in manufacturing today and warrant\ngreater management attention.\nPage 21\nReferences\nAkinc, U.
