In particular it is suggested that interpretations of the causes of poverty, and the thinking of Richard Titmuss, were characterised by a \u2018denial\u2019 of agency and almost total emphasis on structural factors. The implications were that this left the Titmuss paradigm vulnerable to more individualistic interpretations in the 1980s. In this article we look more closely at Titmuss's work and thought in the three decades of the 1940s, the 1950s, and the 1960s, aiming to produce a fuller and more nuanced analysis. We argue that the distinctive position adopted by Titmuss was in large part his response to earlier and on-going debates about social pathology.

What he was trying to do was to make\nothers aware of the broader context in which behaviour had to be analysed. But Titmuss\nhimself became constrained by the paradigm that he did more than anyone else to create. Thus\ndebates about behaviour, structure, and poverty have been marked as much by continuity as by\nchange.\nIntroduction\nThe past decade has witnessed debates, among writers on social policy, on the\nrole of agency. It has been suggested that the dominant paradigms in the study of\nsocial welfare have neglected the role of human agency in responding to threats\nof welfare across the life course (Titterton, 1992). Others have suggested that\nthe relationship between welfare and behaviour is central to understanding the\noutcomes of welfare provision, and for modelling future demand (McLaughlin,\n1996). This has led to a search for a new research paradigm that will bridge the\ndichotomy between agency and structure, and \u2018create a more multidimensional\nview of what poverty means in relation to the quality of life\u2019 (Williams and\nPillinger, 1996: 27). Similarly, there has been a call for research that is more\nsensitive to the way that people\u2019s health and welfare needs are structured, their\nresources, support networks, opportunities and social relations (Williams, Popay\nand Oakley, 1999). It is argued that this new interest in agency creates an\nopportunity for a social science that is more sensitive to the activities of poor\npeople while reflecting more fully the difference and diversity that characterises\ncontemporary British society (Deacon and Mann, 1999).\n226 john welshman\nThe argument that an interest in agency and behaviour is recent itself\nembodies important assumptions about the development of the academic\ndiscipline of social administration in the post-war period. It has long been\nrecognised that the empiricist tradition was particularly strong in social\nadministration at that time (Wilding, 1976: 162\u20133; Taylor-Gooby, 1981; Mishra,\n1989: 66\u20138). In comparing British sociology with social policy and administration\nin this period, Martin Bulmer characterises the latter as being \u2018strong on\napplication, moderate on empirical research, and extremely weak on theory\u2019\n(1991: 163). Recent writers have been more concerned with the way in which social\nadministration allegedly ignored the role of agency. It has been suggested that\ndemocratic socialists such as Marshall, Titmuss, and Crosland viewed the welfare\nstate as \u2018one designed to be financed and operated by knights, for the benefit of\npawns\u2019 (Le Grand, 1997: 157, 2003: 7). Professionals worked in the public interest,\nwhile individuals in receipt of the benefits of the welfare state were essentially\npassive. Frank Field has suggested in the same vein that the welfare state has\ndeveloped no room for discussions of behaviour (1998: 53). Fiona Williams, Jennie\nPopay, and Ann Oakley have suggested that in the 1960s and 1970s, the notion of\nhuman agency was ignored (1999: 11). Particularly relevant to this article is the\nclaim that fears that addressing agency would endorse a punitive and atavistic\nindividualism constrained and confined the debate about welfare in the era of the\nclassic welfare state. Agency was not merely neglected in academic studies of social\npolicy, but was consciously dismissed (Deacon and Mann, 1999). It is suggested\nthat this was both a reaction to the individualism of the Poor Law and of such\nbodies as the Charity Organisation Society, and to social casework in the 1940s and\n1950s.\nThis debate has also incorporated important assumptions about the thinking\nof Richard Titmuss, arguably the dominant influence on social administration in\nthe post-war period. Alan Deacon for instance, claims that the most striking\naspect of Titmuss\u2019s writing was not his stance on the market but his total\nopposition to \u2018judgementalism\u2019 (1993a: 91). Titmuss was associated with the\ntradition in British social policy of \u2018egalitarian collectivism\u2019, and he neglected\nquestions \u2018of personal responsibility and labour market behaviour\u2019. This led to\na position of \u2018almost total determinism and to a complete denial of personal\nresponsibility\u2019 (1993b: 236). Robert Page argues that one of the great strengths of\nscholars such as Titmuss and Galbraith has been their focus on socio-economic\ninequalities rather than on the \u2018personal conduct of the disadvantaged\u2019 (1996: 141).\nThus to Titmuss, \u2018arguments about problem families or cycles of deprivation were\nan irrelevance or worse\u2019 and those who could not understand that were \u2018simply\nbeyond the pale\u2019 (Deacon and Mann, 1999: 418). Deacon argues further that\nTitmuss\u2019s faith in human nature, along with his neglect of behaviour, presented\nconservatives like Charles Murray and Lawrence Mead in the 1980s with an\n\u2018unnecessary weapon\u2019 (1993b: 241, 1996: 201).\nthe unknown titmuss 227\nMore recently, Deacon has shifted position somewhat, distinguishing\nbetween a \u2018Titmuss paradigm or school\u2019 and a \u2018quasi-Titmuss paradigm or\nschool\u2019. Because it was increasingly concerned with the growth of material\ninequalities, it was the latter that paid less attention to altruism, and the\nquality of social relationships. The distinction is made between the ideas of\nTitmuss himself, and later exponents, where Titmuss\u2019s alleged rejection of\nindividualist or behavioural accounts of poverty hardened into an approach\nthat precluded any discussion of such factors (Deacon, 2002: 14). Nonetheless\ndespite this new distinction, many of the received interpretations of Titmuss\nremain. First, that he believed welfare could redistribute resources and lessen\ninequalities. Second, that it could bring about redistribution through processes\nand institutions that would contribute to social integration and encourage\nfellowship. Third, that Titmuss was committed to universalism, hostile to means\ntests, and insistent that welfare had to be non-judgemental. Fourth, that he\nwas not overly interested in behaviour, because he was optimistic about both\nfuture economic performance, and human nature. Fifth, that he did discuss\nagency, because of the importance he attached to altruism. Sixth, that it was\nthe \u2018quasi-Titmuss paradigm or school\u2019 that, in its hostility to explaining\npoverty by reference to the behaviour of the poor, created an intellectual\nvoid that was filled by neo-Conservative writers in the 1980s (Deacon, 2002:\n13\u201330).\nIt is argued in this article that the analysis of Titmuss\u2019s role in these debates\noffered by these writers has concentrated on a very selective reading of his best-\nknown publications, particularly the collected essays. For that reason, it presents\nan overly simplified and ahistorical view of Titmuss\u2019s thinking on questions of\nagency and behaviour. Here we look more closely at Titmuss\u2019s life and work,\nto draw on less well-known material and correspondence, aiming to produce\na fuller and more nuanced analysis. By \u2018agency\u2019 we mean the capacity of the\nindividual to act, although in the writing of Titmuss and others, there is an\nimportant elision with the idea of \u2018agency\u2019 as dysfunctional behaviour which was\nallegedly the cause of poverty and other problems. In seeking to locate Titmuss\u2019s\nideas within their proper historical context, the approach taken is similar to Alice\nO\u2019Connor\u2019s argument that \u2018poverty knowledge\u2019 has been historically constructed\n(2001: 8). While a complete treatment is not possible in the space available, we\nlook at Titmuss\u2019s work and thought in the three decades of the 1940s, the 1950s,\nand the 1960s. We argue that the distinctive position adopted by Titmuss was in\nlarge part his response to earlier and on-going debates about social pathology.\nWhat he was trying to do was to make others aware of the broader context in\nwhich behaviour had to be analysed. But Titmuss himself became constrained\nby the paradigm that he did more than anyone else to create. Thus debates about\nbehaviour, structure, and poverty have been marked as much by continuity as by\nchange.\n228 john welshman\nFrom the \u2018social problem group\u2019 to \u2018problem families\u2019\nAlong with the more recent work of Deacon, there is no shortage of secondary\nwriting on Richard Titmuss, his thinking and his career (Marshall, 1973; Gowing,\n1975; Reisman, 1977; Donnison, 1979; Rose, 1981; Vaizey, 1983; Kincaid, 1984;\nWilding, 1995; Oakley, 1996; Alcock, Glennerster, Oakley and Sinfield, 2001).\nRobert Pinker, for instance, has written that \u2018social administration owes an\nincalculable debt to Richard Titmuss\u2019 (Pinker, 1977: xv). Other work has provided\na more critical portrait, and has hinted at contradictions in Titmuss\u2019s stance\non means testing and membership of the Supplementary Benefits Commission\n(Vaizey, 1983; Kincaid, 1984: 119\u201320). Nevertheless while this secondary literature\nprovides an account of Titmuss\u2019s early career, it has been less successful in setting\nhis ideas within their proper historical context. With the important exception\nof Ann Oakley\u2019s research on Titmuss and the Eugenics Society, the bulk of this\nwork has concentrated on his later essays. Very little attention has been given to\nhis thinking before 1960, and few attempts have been made to explain some of\nthe obvious contradictions that his less well-known writings throw up. As long\nago as 1978, Adrian Sinfield noted that \u2018a sound historical base is lacking, or is\nrestricted to too short a scale, in much social policy analysis\u2019 (1978: 149). While\nthis has been remedied in some social policy analyses, it is true of recent writing\non Titmuss.\nFrom an unpromising start, Titmuss was by the late 1930s in the process\nof becoming an important commentator on population issues and health and\nwelfare. At the same time, he had also joined the Eugenics Society in 1937. Formed\nin 1907, the Eugenics Society was concerned with enhancing the quality of the race\nthrough improved knowledge of the laws of heredity. Its membership included\nmiddle-class professionals, including left-wing progressives. But, by the late 1940s,\nthe eugenics movement was in difficulties, in part due to the Nazi experiments in\nsterilisation (Jones, 1986). Ann Oakley has argued that the Eugenics Society holds\nimportant clues to the emergence of the movement for social medicine and to\nTitmuss\u2019s later leadership in the field of social policy. Eugenics offered Titmuss an\nentre\u00b4e into fashionable intellectual circles, while in return he provided the Society\nwith a new type of social analysis that enabled it to move to a more acceptable\nideological position in the debate about health, emphasising the social rather\nthan the biological model (Oakley, 1991: 189, 1997: 88). It has been argued he was\non the liberal wing of the movement and played a pivotal role in the attempt to get\nthe Society to move away from the old behavioural and hereditarian arguments,\nand to encourage its members to emphasise the eugenic significance of nutrition\nand other environmental factors. Hilary Rose suggests that Titmuss\u2019s use of the\nlanguage of national efficiency was \u2018euphenic rather than eugenic\u2019. He was less\nconcerned with fitness for breeding, than with providing the whole population\nwith a healthy environment within which it could realise its potential (Rose, 1981:\n486).\nthe unknown titmuss 229\nSome of Titmuss\u2019s writing in the late 1930s and early 1940s bears out this\ninterpretation. The Society sponsored the publication of his first book, Poverty\nand Population (1938), and there was evidence that Titmuss shared some eugenic\npreoccupations. While the main theme of his book was regional differentials\nin life chances, Titmuss wrote that those unable to migrate from the depressed\nregions, below average both mentally and physically, would inter-marry and form\nclusters of the \u2018social problem group\u2019. In turn, this group was \u2018the source from\nwhich all too many of our criminals, paupers, degenerates, unemployables and\ndefectives are recruited\u2019 (1938: 288). The theory of the \u2018social problem group\u2019\nhad been highlighted by the Wood Report on Mental Deficiency (1929) and was\npropagated by the Eugenics Society in the 1930s. By the early 1940s, Titmuss\nwas heavily involved in the Society, including an evacuation scheme sponsored\nby its Canadian counterpart (Oakley, 1996: 176\u20137). Nevertheless in this period,\nTitmuss also joined Maurice Newfield, editor of the Eugenics Review, in stressing\nthe role of nutrition and other structural factors (Oakley, 1991: 177\u20139). In a\nreview of Rowntree\u2019s second survey of York for instance, Titmuss and Franc\u00b8ois\nLafitte wrote that nature and nurture were so entangled that \u2018no eugenist can\nafford to neglect the study of environmental factors \u2013 especially of economic\nand social conditions\u2019 (1942: 106). Subsequently in a paper to the Eugenics\nSociety, delivered in November 1943, Titmuss argued that people should not\nbe content with \u2018weeding out the demonstrably unfit\u2019, but should \u2018look equally\nto the improvement of the social environment\u2019 (1944: 57).\nBut Titmuss\u2019s thinking was more complex than a simple move from a\nbiological to a social model of health, or from a behavioural to a structural\ninterpretation of poverty, implies. Early hints of Titmuss\u2019s attitude to the role of\nparents are brought out well in his writing on the subject of juvenile delinquency.\nIn November 1942, for example, Titmuss commented that \u2018faulty parental training\nis a factor in the causation of delinquency but Mannheim\u2019s work does not show\nit to be the most important agent\u2019. He argued instead that \u2018overcrowding and\nbad housing conditions produce social misfits, frustration, petty delinquencies\nand so on\u2019.1 In his study of crime in interwar England, Hermann Mannheim,\nthen Lecturer in Criminology at the London School of Economics, had listed\nsome 53 possible causes of juvenile delinquency, based on an investigation of\nthe records of a Borstal institution. Mannheim left out poverty, owing to a\nlack of data, although he conceded that it might be the real cause of ill-health\nand educational failure, family quarrels, the premature death of parents, poor\nhousing, and unemployment (1940: 261). Overall he argued that both social\nfactors, and physical and mental factors, were causes of juvenile delinquency.\nHe discussed the role of parents, but also the influence of unemployment and\nhousing conditions. Mannheim argued that unemployment was a direct cause of\ndelinquency, especially when it coincided with \u2018unfavourable home conditions\u2019,\nbut he was reluctant to go further, since there were no control groups in his\n230 john welshman\nstudy (1940: 282). Titmuss had been directed to Mannheim\u2019s work in January\n1939 (Oakley 1996: 83) and his comment suggests he had some sympathy for\nthe Mannheim position \u2013 that parental training was a factor, but not the most\nimportant one.\nThe early 1940s witnessed an important shift in thinking, away from the\nnotion of the \u2018social problem group\u2019 that had been influential in the 1930s, to a\nnew concept of the \u2018problem family\u2019. The key survey in this respect was a report\nby the Women\u2019s Group on Public Welfare, Our Towns (1943) that was written\nin response to the evacuation of schoolchildren in September 1939 (Welshman,\n1999). The report had many recommendations that were more structural in\nnature, including ones for dealing with housing and overcrowding, and plans for\nwidening the scope of health and welfare services. However it was the point about\n\u2018problem families\u2019 that was subsequently picked up by public health doctors and\nthe voluntary Family Service Units as an essentially behavioural interpretation\nof the causes of poverty and deprivation (Macnicol, 1999). Titmuss himself had\nan opportunity to explore \u2018problem families\u2019 when, in 1944, he was appointed as\na part-time statistical adviser to Luton, in Bedfordshire. A general Luton survey\nwas published in 1945, but a second report focused on \u2018problem families\u2019 in\nparticular \u2013 Titmuss organised a grant from the Eugenics Society and arranged\nfor the town\u2019s Medical Officer of Health to be elected to the Society\u2019s Council\n(Oakley, 1991: 181, 1996: 277).\nThe later report argued that \u2018social problem families\u2019 were not a\nhomogeneous group, and included at least four separate categories. The definition\ndeveloped was of families who, for reasons other than \u2018old age, accident,\nmisfortune, illness or pregnancy\u2019, required more supervision and help, and\nfor longer periods, than was normally provided by social services (Tomlinson,\n1946: 11). Others regarded as \u2018biological casualties\u2019 (such as older people), \u2018social\ncasualties\u2019 and \u2018problem individuals\u2019 were excluded. Investigations of 167 such\nfamilies suggested the \u2018causes\u2019 were subnormal mental capacity, adverse family\ninfluences during childhood, broken families, frequent pregnancies, chronic\nill-health, husbands absent in the forces and alcoholism. The recommended\nsolutions were education by health visitors, nursery schools and caseworkers who\ncould rehabilitate families through manual work. Overall, the survey concluded\nthat there was no \u2018static social problem group\u2019 in Luton, and relatively few\n\u2018problem families\u2019, but that a national survey was needed (Tomlinson, 1946: 37).\nIn the methodology it adopted, the identified causes, and the recommended\nsolutions, the Luton survey was very similar to other surveys carried out at this\ntime. At the same time, the definition adopted was more careful, and the findings\nmore optimistic, and this may reflect the involvement of Titmuss.\nThe extent of Titmuss\u2019s influence on the second Luton survey is unclear,\nthough he and others were thanked for their \u2018encouragement, advice and helpful\ncriticism\u2019 (Tomlinson, 1946: 5). Moreover his involvement led directly to his\nthe unknown titmuss 231\nbecoming one of the original members of the Problem Families Committee that\nwas established by the Eugenics Society in July 1947. He attended its first meeting,\nalong with other Society members that included Lord Horder, David Caradog\nJones, C. P. Blacker (the Society\u2019s Secretary), and several public health doctors.2\nThe plan was to carry out the national survey of \u2018problem families\u2019 that had been\nwidely recommended. Ann Oakley comments that Titmuss appeared to share\nthe eugenist view that \u2018a complex of social failures and psychological problems\nmarked out in a distinctive way a subgroup of the population responsible for\nan overuse of the health and social services\u2019 (Oakley, 1991: 181). But there were\nsigns that Titmuss was uneasy about the work of the Committee. In November\n1947, it had agreed a \u2018problem family\u2019 definition that stressed \u2018(i) intrac-\ntable ineducability, (ii) instability or infirmity of character, (iii) the presentation\nby the family of multiple social problems, and (iv) a squalid home\u2019.3 But\nTitmuss suggested in a letter that not enough emphasis was being given to\nprevention and rehabilitation.4 In fact, he played little part in subsequent\nmeetings, and resigned from the Committee altogether in November 1950,\narguing that other commitments had prevented him from devoting the necessary\ntime and attention.5 As the report neared publication, the Society\u2019s Secretary\nqueried whether Titmuss should be listed as a member of the Committee\nwho had resigned, or left out altogether. Titmuss replied he was very glad to\nsee that the work had reached an advanced stage and would look forward\nto reading the report, but he also suggested his lack of involvement in\nthe survey meant it would be \u2018misleading\u2019 if his name was associated with\nit.6\nEarlier work on the younger Titmuss has tended to concentrate on the\nmove from a biological to a social model of health, as symbolised in his work\nin the Eugenics Society and the movement for social medicine. But, while it\nhas been recognised that Titmuss fell back on \u2018vague and contradictory notions\nof biological influences\u2019 (Oakley, 1991: 180), and that his \u2018problem family\u2019 work\nreflected \u2018a limiting concern with traditional approaches to social categorisation\u2019\n(Oakley, 1997: 93), the obvious paradoxes in his stance have not been explained.\nMore recent writing has also simplified what is a complex and contradictory story:\nif, as has been suggested, Titmuss dismissed the concept of \u2018problem families\u2019,\nwhy was he directly involved in these projects? Titmuss clearly did use support for\neugenic ideas in an opportunist way. Nevertheless his interest in these approaches\nwas much more than simply tactical. In part, Titmuss\u2019s involvement in the Luton\nreport and Eugenics Society survey was a natural reflection of his interest in the\nearly 1940s in debates about the \u2018unfit\u2019 and the environment, and in the role\nof parents in relation to juvenile delinquency. What is clear is that Titmuss was\nclearly interested in the relative importance of behaviour and structure in the\ncauses of social \u2018problems\u2019, and that this was to provide an important thread in\nhis thinking into the 1950s and beyond.\n232 john welshman\nProblems of social policy, Juvenile Delinquency, and \u2018sources of\nsocial need\u2019\nMany of the features identified as being key in the Titmuss paradigm \u2013 his\noptimism about human nature, belief in universal services, and opposition to\nmeans testing \u2013 are brought out well in his famous civilian history of wartime,\nProblems of Social Policy, published in 1950. Titmuss had been invited to join\nthe group of historians commissioned to write the official civil histories of the\nSecond World War, and to cover the work of the Ministry of Health. It was from\nthis narrow brief that Titmuss was to produce a much broader thesis about war\nand social policy. He wrote that the evacuation of mothers and children, and the\nblitz of 1940, \u2018stimulated inquiry and proposals for reform long before victory\nwas even thought possible\u2019 so that during the war \u2018the pressures for a higher\nstandard of welfare and a deeper comprehension of social justice steadily gained\nin strength\u2019 (1950: 507\u20138). What were remarkable about the wartime expansion\nof school meals and milk, argued Titmuss, were the consensus behind policy,\nand the speed at which changes were made. He wrote that \u2018it was the universal\ncharacter of these welfare policies which ensured their acceptance and success.\nThey were free of social discrimination and the indignities of the Poor Law\u2019 (1950:\n514). Historians have been at pains to revise the Titmuss interpretation of the\nwartime period, arguing for example that he drew too stark a contrast between\nthe 1930s and the 1940s, and that officials were slow to accept the implications of\nevacuation for policy reform, preferring to stress the need for behavioural rather\nthan structural changes (Welshman, 1999: 784). But again the wartime history\nhas been more often cited than read.\nWhen commentators look at Titmuss in the 1950s they tend to turn first to\nhis inaugural lecture as Professor of Social Administration, given at the London\nSchool of Economics in May 1951, and this also appears to provide further support\nfor the conventional interpretation. Titmuss quoted approvingly from R. H.\nTawney\u2019s own inaugural lecture as Director of the Ratan Tata Foundation, given\nin October 1913. Titmuss suggested that Tawney had argued that \u2018the problem of\npoverty . . . is not a problem of individual character and its waywardness, but a\nproblem of economic and industrial organisation. It had to be studied first at its\nsources, and only secondly in its manifestations\u2019 (1958a: 18). Titmuss noted that\nthe character of many of the new social services created in the early 1900s had been\nmoulded by the \u2018moral assumptions\u2019 of the nineteenth century, and there had\nbeen little attempt to explain why people behaved as they did. The application\nof assumptions about how people ought to behave to the new social services\nmeant that they treated \u2018manifestations of disorder in the individual rather than\nthe underlying causes in the family or social group\u2019 (1958a: 19). The implication\nwas that since then an important shift had occurred, from locating the cause of\nsocial problems in individual behaviour, to acknowledging the influence of wider\nstructural factors.\nthe unknown titmuss 233\nMoreover by the mid-1950s, Titmuss was critical of the concept of the\n\u2018problem family\u2019. In a book foreword published in 1957, Titmuss wrote there\nwas a long tradition of concern about families \u2018supposedly characterised by\nsimilar traits, and thought to represent a closed, pathological entity\u2019 (1957: v).\nFurthermore, he argued that the debate on the \u2018problem family\u2019 had been\nconducted in a particularly uncritical way, since precision had been lacking,\nbiology had obscured what might be learnt from sociology and psychology, and\nthe emphasis had been on the classification and counting of \u2018abnormals\u2019. In\nshort, \u2018what knowledge has been gained from all these inquiries has not\naccumulated on any theoretical foundations\u2019 (1957: v). Titmuss argued that it\nwas the growth of social policy that had made people more aware of the problem\nof \u2018social vagabonds\u2019, and it was even more important to make explicit the ethical\nand social values that underlay administrative activity and casework intervention.\nHe wrote that \u2018the attitude that society adopts to its deviants, and especially its\npoor and politically inarticulate deviants, reflects its ultimate values\u2019 (1957: vi).\nNevertheless other evidence from the 1950s provides support for a more\nnuanced interpretation of his stance. Titmuss\u2019s criticism of the methodology\nof much \u2018problem family\u2019 research notwithstanding, he appeared nevertheless\nto approve of efforts to help these families. In a lecture on families and the\nwelfare state, given in May 1952, Titmuss noted \u2018of course there are some who\nare feckless and irresponsible\u2019, this was inevitable in a country with a population\nof 50 m, and they were represented in all social classes. The real question was\nwhether there were more of them than previously. He argued that many aspects\nof family relationships had improved, with less drunkenness, illegitimacy, child\nneglect, prostitution, and truancy than formerly. At the same time, he noted \u2018of\ncourse, we still have with us our \u201cproblem families\u201d but my impression is that\nthe proportion is much lower than it used to be\u2019.7 Furthermore while Titmuss\nwas critical of \u2018problem family\u2019 research, as head of a social work department\nhe could not be publicly opposed to casework intervention. In December 1954,\nhe congratulated the relevant civil servant on the appearance of a Ministry of\nHealth circular that urged local authorities to tackle \u2018problem families\u2019 using\nhealth visitors.8 And he noted that voluntary and local authority activity in this\nsphere was \u2018impressive\u2019 in its scale (1957: vi). Thus this evidence suggests that\nDeacon and Mann are wrong in arguing that Titmuss would have seen debates\nabout \u2018problem families\u2019 as an irrelevance or worse (Deacon and Mann, 1999:\n418). Rather he was directly involved in these debates in the immediate post-war\nperiod.\nThe uncertainty in Titmuss\u2019s own mind about structure, behaviour, and\npoverty is also apparent on a close reading of Problems of Social Policy. In\nthe chapter on the reception of the evacuees, for example, Titmuss looked at\nthree issues to do with child health and welfare \u2013 bedwetting, footwear and\nclothing, and head lice. Titmuss was concerned to defend parents, suggesting it\n234 john welshman\nwas likely they had sent children away in their best clothes, and many had taken\nthe trouble to attend school medical inspections before the War (1950: 115, 133).\nNevertheless on issues such as juvenile delinquency, Titmuss was prepared to take\na stronger line. The early War years led to an increase in juvenile delinquency in\nLondon, Glasgow, and other cities (1950: 147\u20138). Titmuss wrote that children\nfrom broken homes got little training in their first five years, and became\n\u2018unstable, aggressive, lazy, cynical and untrustworthy\u2019 (1950: 123). Some of these\nchildren were what Marie Paneth in her book Branch Street (1944) had called\n\u2018hurt people\u2019, who \u2018live in an atmosphere which, though outspoken and tough\nin many ways, is secretive and untruthful on essential points\u2019 (1950: 123\u20134). In\ninterpreting juvenile delinquency, Titmuss had earlier been swayed by the work\nof Hermann Mannheim, but he was also influenced by John Bowlby\u2019s research.\nBowlby concluded from cases seen at the London Child Guidance Clinic that\na large proportion of children who stole persistently were of \u2018an affectionless\ncharacter\u2019, a condition which resulted from \u2018their having suffered prolonged\nseparations from their mothers or foster-mothers in their early childhood\u2019\n(1946: 49).\nTitmuss was to extend Bowlby\u2019s analysis to the wider issue of bedwetting,\narguing that children who wet their beds appeared to come from the kind of\nbroken homes which produced, in the words of John Bowlby, \u2018affectionless\nthieves\u2019 (1950: 123). But in other cases, Titmuss argued that behaviour was an\nadaptive response to the environment people lived in, so that \u2018insanitary and\nanti-social behaviour was closely linked to the physical environment from which\nthe children came. Slum mores are consistent with a slum home\u2019 (1950: 124).\nThus \u2018corrupt manners\u2019 were the product of a \u2018corrupting environment\u2019, and\nTitmuss wrote of the city that \u2018such an environment signifies slovenliness and\ndirt, bad language and moral delinquency\u2019 (1950: 132). It was environmental\nconditions, overcrowding and the lack of baths and lavatories that, along with\npoverty, shaped the behaviour of evacuees and their mothers. Elsewhere, it was\na case of cultural difference that led to misunderstandings. Titmuss wrote of the\nreturn home of mothers, for instance, that \u2018the isolation and strange quiet of\nthe country . . . boredom, uncomprehended ways of life; these were the things\nwhich sometimes led to bad manners, ingratitude and irresponsibility\u2019, and this\nwas how the rural middle-class families with whom the evacuees were billeted\ninterpreted such behaviour (1950: 182).\nIn September 1939, much of the friction between evacuees and host families\nhad been caused by head lice. On this point, Titmuss argued that if between 5 and\n50 per cent of children and mothers had head lice, it was not fair to stigmatise\nthem all as \u2018problem families\u2019. Only 2\u22125 per cent were \u2018problem children\u2019 from\n\u2018problem homes\u2019. The other 95\u221298 per cent were not \u2018the neglected children of\nirresponsible parents\u2019, and were not part of the \u2018social problem\u2019 group\u2019 (1950: 135).\nThus, from this, Titmuss was able to make his famous assertion that \u2018the decencies\nthe unknown titmuss 235\nof health and sanitation are more easily achieved by the rich than the poor, but\nthey are no sufficient measure of personal virtue or political principle. The louse\nis not a political creature \u2013 it does not discriminate between the salt of the earth\nand the scum of the earth\u2019 (1950: 136). Overall, we can see in this short section\nfrom Problems of Social Policy that Titmuss\u2019s views were complex, and heavily\ninfluenced by others. On the question of juvenile delinquency, he conceded that\nparents had a role to play, but also argued that behaviour could be an adaptive\nresponse to the environment in which people found themselves. Similarly, while\nTitmuss distinguished between the concept of a \u2018social problem group\u2019 and the\nnotion of \u2018problem families\u2019, and was aware that both were stigmatising devices,\nhe was not totally opposed to them. In his ambivalence, Titmuss reflected other\nsurveys, such as the Our Towns report, which had both exposed problems of\nhousing and the inadequacy of health services in the 1930s, but also endorsed a\nnew emphasis on a residuum of socially inadequate people (Welshman, 1999).\nThe inaugural lecture is worth looking at further, since the relationship\nbetween Titmuss and Tawney appears to provide answers to some of these\nquestions. Alan Deacon has noted that Titmuss quoted approvingly from Tawney\nto trace the development of social administration as an academic subject in terms\nof a shift from behavioural to structural understandings of poverty (1996: 199).\nIt has been suggested that Titmuss endorsed Tawney\u2019s approach to equality, but\nsince he did not share Tawney\u2019s religious faith, differed from him on the role of\ncharacter and choice. Since Tawney held a Christian view of people that included\nsin as well as compassion, he stressed duties and responsibilities rather than rights.\nTitmuss, on the other hand, was more optimistic about human nature, and so\nemphasised the duties of the state to the individual, rather than the obligations\nof the latter. It has further been argued that Titmuss was misled by the utopian\nelement in Tawney\u2019s thought, and failed to notice his qualifications \u2013 it is this\nthat presents conservatives with an \u2018entirely unnecessary weapon\u2019 (Deacon, 1996:\n201).\nWhat is interesting is what Tawney said in the original lecture, and what\nTitmuss missed out in his rather selective reading of it. Tawney did argue that\nwhat rich people called the \u2018problem of poverty\u2019, poor people called the \u2018problem\nof riches\u2019, and concentrating on destitution was to \u2018beg the questions that most\nneed investigation\u2019 (1913: 10). Moreover he argued \u2018problems of poverty\u2019 should be\napproached as \u2018problems of industry\u2019, with the trade, town, or school as the unit\nof enquiry rather than the individual or family. Thus in his view, modern poverty\nwas not associated with personal misfortunes, but with the economic status of\nclasses and occupations. Nevertheless Tawney also believed that the capacity of\nindividuals to resist misfortune depended on the \u2018habits of life\u2019 and economic\nresources that they had acquired before disaster struck (1913: 12). What was needed\nwas to develop this \u2018economic resisting power\u2019 through public intervention. So\nwhat Tawney actually said, to be slightly misquoted subsequently by Titmuss, was\n236 john welshman\nthat \u2018the problem of poverty . . . is primarily an industrial one. It is to be studied\nfirst at its sources, and only secondly in its manifestations, in the mill, in the mine\nor at the docks, not in casual wards or on the Embankment\u2019 (1913: 12).\nHow important therefore is the distinction between Tawney seeing the\n\u2018problem of poverty\u2019 as being \u2018primarily an industrial one\u2019 and Titmuss\u2019s later\ninaccurate paraphrasing that it was \u2018not a problem of individual character and\nits waywardness\u2019? Norman Dennis and A. H. Halsey have argued that in the\ninaugural lecture Titmuss provoked laughter and applause by criticising older\nviews that character and choice might influence conduct, and that poor people\nhad anything to learn from others (1988: 254). In fact there is very little support\nin the published text for this comment by Dennis and Halsey. What is interesting\nis that Titmuss took the point about poverty and individual character from the\nTawney lecture, but left out the bits about the individual\u2019s capacity to resist\nmisfortune, and about habits of life. Leaving aside his odd location of the causes\nof poverty in the family or social group, he seemed to go out of his way to deny\nthe possibility of any behavioural or individual factor in the causation of poverty.\nBut what seems apparent from other writings is that the inaugural lecture was\nsomething of an exception in this respect.\nDebates about juvenile delinquency had earlier provided a particularly\ninteresting forum in which to examine the interface between behaviour and\nstructure, and Titmuss returned to this theme in the 1950s. Especially revealing\nwas the preface that he wrote for a study of juvenile delinquency carried out\nin Liverpool and published in 1954. Inspired by William Foote Whyte\u2019s Street\nCorner Society (1943), the methodology adopted by John Barron Mays was one of\nparticipant observation, based on 80 boys who were members of the city\u2019s youth\nclubs. Mays, then Warden of the Liverpool University Settlement, attempted to\ndistinguish between \u2018personal\u2019 and \u2018environmental\u2019 factors. In his view, most\nchildren who broke the law were \u2018delinquents\u2019 who sooner or later conformed\nto accepted social standards, while \u2018criminals\u2019 were emotionally insecure and\nrefused to conform. Delinquent behaviour was thus merely one aspect of group\nlife, and Mays asked \u2018is there in fact a sub-cultural group existing within the wider\nculture which is more complacent towards breaking the law and more tolerant\nof proscribed behaviour ?\u2019 (1954: 83). This reflected Foote Whyte\u2019s work, but also\nappeared to anticipate Hyman Rodman\u2019s \u2018value stretch\u2019 (1963). Mays argued it\nwas in the interaction of environmental and individual psychological factors that\nthe delinquency of any particular boy was to be understood. He concluded that\njuvenile delinquency was merely part of the behaviour pattern of underprivileged\nneighbourhoods in big cities that had long been characterised by poverty, casual\nemployment and bad housing (1954: 147). However in his recommendations,\nMays also focused on efforts to help children and parents to \u2018carry out their\nduties\u2019, such as improved contact with youth clubs, marriage preparation for\nyoung people, and football matches organised by social workers (1954: 161\u20137).\nthe unknown titmuss 237\nIn his preface, Titmuss agreed that what was necessary was not only to\nunderstand the life of individual boys, but their lives in terms of their friends,\nfamily, and community. For most of the boys, behaviour was not so much an\nindication of individual maladjustment, as part of adjusting to a sub-culture that\nwas at odds with the culture of society as a whole. In this, he acknowledged the\ninfluence on Mays of Foote Whyte, where the problem of Cornerville had not\nbeen \u2018lack of organisation but failure of its own social organisation to mesh with\nthe structure of the society around it\u2019 (1943: 273\u20134). But Titmuss\u2019s explanation\nfor the causes of juvenile delinquency was striking, since he wrote that \u2018out\nof a long history of poverty, neglect and exploitation, culturally transmitted\nfrom generation to generation, there has accumulated a tradition of delinquent\nbehaviour\u2019 (1954: v). His interpretation of the causes of juvenile delinquency\ndid stress the role of structural factors, and he was concerned to argue that\nthe focus should be on the group, rather than the individual. Nevertheless he\nconceded that neglect and exploitation were also important, and his mention\nof cultural transmission between generations, coupled with his endorsement of\nMays\u2019 emphasis on services to support parents, comes remarkably close to the\n\u2018cycle of deprivation\u2019 thesis of the 1970s. Once again, it suggests that Deacon\nand Mann are incorrect in suggesting that to Titmuss, mention of a \u2018cycle of\ndeprivation\u2019 would have been an \u2018irrelevance or worse\u2019 (1999: 418). On this\nevidence, he might very well have become involved in Sir Keith\u2019s initiative, had\nhe lived to see it.\nFoote Whyte crops up again in a paper given in August 1956, where Titmuss\nexplored the impact of industrialisation on the family in Western Europe, Britain,\nand the USA. Titmuss suggested that the way children were socialised within\nfamilies was of critical importance to the \u2018health\u2019 of societies, and it was the\nfamily that was the \u2018central mechanism\u2019 for the transmission of culture (1958b:\n107). If people had had stable childhoods then they might be able to stand the\npressures of industrial change. But their children or grandchildren, \u2018reared in an\nunstable culture by parents without a sure sense of direction or purpose\u2019 would be\nmore likely to show the psychological effects of industrialisation. Many of these\neffects were long term, and Titmuss claimed social workers spent much of their\ntime coping with families \u2018disabled and deformed\u2019 by poor housing conditions\n(1958b: 109). In reading studies of industrialisation, Titmuss had been struck by\nthe differences in the \u2018norms of behaviour\u2019 expected from factory workers, and in\ntheir lives outside work, in relation to concepts such as stability, status and rewards\nand initiative. Thus if industrialisation led to feelings of personal dissatisfaction\nor \u2018a dispossession of personality\u2019, these could become family and community\nproblems (1958b: 116). These problems could neither be solved by industry nor\nthe family, argued Titmuss, but by the stabilising, preventive, and protective roles\nof the social services. One of Titmuss\u2019s sources was a collection edited by Foote\nWhyte, then Associate Professor of Sociology at Chicago, that summarised the\n238 john welshman\nwork of the Committee on Human Relations in Industry, set up in 1943 and\nchaired by W. Lloyd Warner. Allison Davis, for example, had argued that the\nbehaviour of \u2018underprivileged\u2019 workers was a response to their socio-economic\nand cultural environment (1946: 104). In seeking to shift the discussion from\nhabits viewed as \u2018innate\u2019, to characteristics that might be realistic and rational in\na particular environment, Davis was making a similar journey to Titmuss.\nWhat has also not previously been realised is that Titmuss explored \u2018sources\nof social need\u2019 in a book manuscript written over a four-year period (1952\u201356),\nbut which was never published. In the proposed chapter 4, \u2018The Growth of\nDependency\u2019, Titmuss argued that dependency could arise through economic\nfactors such as unemployment, or by others that were \u2018culturally-imposed\u2019.\nBut most \u2018social dependencies\u2019 were a combination of both. Titmuss wrote\nthat \u2018the vast majority of social dependencies are, however, inter-related as to\ncause whether it stems predominantly from the characteristics of the person, the\nsituation or both simultaneously\u2019.9 He argued that as standards rose, and became\nmore discriminatory and demanding, the more intolerant society became of\nits \u2018ineffectives\u2019. These included older people, \u2018problem families\u2019, delinquents,\npsychotics, and the \u2018feeble-minded\u2019 who were variously retired, segregated,\npunished, and institutionalised. As the dependencies of these groups were\nemphasised and their employment opportunities restricted, needs were created.\nIt was the task of the social services to meet these needs.10 Titmuss argued that\nfor the benefit of society as a whole, and as part of the price of scientific and\ntechnological advance, more \u2018social ineffectives\u2019 or \u2018rejected people\u2019 were being\ncreated. This was either because they were \u2018ineffectives in fact\u2019, or because they\nfelt and behaved like rejected people. He concluded that \u2018though not all are or\nwill become economically dependant people many of them with a permanent,\nirreversible physical or mental disability will be along with their families\u2019.11\nThus Titmuss seemed to be making a distinction here between people who\nactually were \u2018ineffectives\u2019, and those who behaved like this because they had\nbecome stigmatised. He certainly agreed that dependencies were created both by\n\u2018individual characteristics\u2019 and by \u2018the situation\u2019. Titmuss continued to develop\nhis ideas on \u2018dependency\u2019 in the early 1960s, as we shall see in the following\nsection.\nAlan Deacon has distinguished between the \u2018Titmuss paradigm\u2019 and the\n\u2018quasi-Titmuss paradigm\u2019, where he argues it was the latter that paid little\nattention to how far people\u2019s behaviour and activities represented some form of\nchoice or agency (2002: 14). Because of the importance he attached to altruism,\nTitmuss did discuss agency, and did write about the ways welfare could shape\nattitudes and values. Yet at the same time Deacon suggests that Titmuss either\n\u2018fiercely rejected\u2019 any attempt to explain poverty in terms of the failings or\nweaknesses of the poor themselves, or simply did not dwell much on issues of\nbehaviour \u2013 by the late 1960s these analyses were \u2018irrelevant\u2019 and \u2018did not merit\nthe unknown titmuss 239\nfurther enquiry\u2019 (2002: 14, 22). There seems to be an important gap between what\nTitmuss thought and what he wrote. Even so, it is difficult to find support for\nthe fierce rejection or irrelevance arguments in light of the evidence cited here.\nOn the issue of juvenile delinquency, Titmuss can be seen to move between the\nBowlby position that the key issue was separation from parents, and the Mays\nargument that structural factors were more significant. Similarly in Problems of\nSocial Policy, and on such issues as bedwetting and head lice, Titmuss can be seen\nto be developing an adaptive interpretation of how people\u2019s behaviour might be\nmoulded by the structural characteristics of the environment in which they found\nthemselves. He continued to distinguish between the \u2018social problem group\u2019 and\nthe \u2018problem family\u2019, but nonetheless approved of social casework. Furthermore\nin the unpublished manuscript, Titmuss begins to confront directly the question\nof the extent to which dependency stemmed from economic circumstances or\npersonal inadequacy. Thus, rather than denying or ignoring these questions,\nTitmuss actively grappled with them, seeking to move to a position that viewed\nbehaviour in a wider context. Here Titmuss\u2019s view of human nature was less\noptimistic than has previously been suggested, and should therefore have been\nless vulnerable to conservative criticism, had it been better publicised.\nTitmuss, Dependency, and the Moynihan report\nThe final period has usually been viewed in terms of Titmuss\u2019s support for\nuniversal services as influenced by his thinking on stigma. As Mike Miller and Paul\nWilding have argued, Titmuss was concerned that services targeted at vulnerable\npeople tended to stigmatise those that received them (Miller, 1987: 13; Wilding,\n1995: 155\u20136). In April 1967, Titmuss provided some insights into his emphasis on\nuniversal services. He argued services should be made available in ways that did\nnot \u2018involve users in any humiliating loss of status, dignity or self-respect. There\nshould be no sense of inferiority, pauperism, shame or stigma in the use of a\npublicly funded service; no attribution that one was being or becoming a \u201cpublic\nburden\u201d\u2019 (1968: 129). On another occasion, relating the concept of \u2018burden\u2019 to\nwelfare, he argued that \u2018if men are treated as a burden to others \u2013 if this is the\nrole expected of them \u2013 then, in time, they will behave as a burden\u2019 (1968: 26).\nIn his final (posthumous) book, Titmuss again outlined his view of \u2018institu-\ntional stigmatising\u2019, following on from Goffman\u2019s concept of \u2018spoiled identity\u2019\n(Abel-Smith and Titmuss, 1974: 44\u20135). Writing of stigma, Titmuss argued \u2018if\nmen and women come to think of (and feel) themselves as inferior persons,\nsubordinated persons, then in part they stigmatise themselves, and in part they\nare reflecting what other people think or say about them\u2019 (Abel-Smith and\nTitmuss, 1974: 44).\nThe final period also provides clear evidence of Titmuss\u2019s belief in altruism\nand his optimism in human nature. Indeed it has been suggested by some\n240 john welshman\ncommentators that the only time that he considered issues of agency was in\ndiscussing altruism in the context of voluntary blood donation systems (Williams,\nPopay and Oakley, 1999: 11). In The Gift Relationship, Titmuss argued that the\ntype \u2018H\u2019 voluntary community donor was characterised by altruism, writing\nthat \u2018these are acts of free will; of the exercise of choice; of conscience without\nshame\u2019 (1970: 89). He suggested that voluntary blood donor systems represented\na democratisation of fellowship relationships, writing \u2018if it is accepted that man\nhas a social and a biological need to help to deny him opportunities to express\nthis need is to deny him the freedom to enter into gift relationships\u2019 (1970: 243).\nAnd Titmuss argued that the private blood market in the United States repressed\naltruism, eroded a sense of community, lowered scientific standards, limited\npersonal and professional freedom, sanctioned profit making in laboratories, and\nincreased the danger of unethical behaviour. Overall, it resulted in a situation\nwhere blood was supplied by low-income groups (1970: 245\u20136). It is this belief\nin human nature that arguably created the gap that was to be exploited by\nconservative writers in the 1980s.\nNevertheless the argument that by the 1960s, Titmuss ignored behaviour also\nseems flawed. In a paper given at Brandeis University in 1962, for example, Titmuss\nsuggested that dependency could have \u2018internal\u2019 causes; could be associated with\nthe wider family; could be linked to the \u2018social good\u2019; or could be imposed by\nexternal \u2018social disservices\u2019.12 In distinguishing between \u2018internal\u2019 and \u2018external\u2019\ncauses, this clearly drew on the unpublished book manuscript of some years\nearlier. Some of his themes were developed by Martin Rein, though in a way\nthat Titmuss was clearly unhappy about.13 Rein argued that \u2018some critics believe\nthat we are in danger of producing in the future a social underclass, displaced\nvictims of a society which no longer requires their labor and rejects them as\nuseless\u2019 (1970: 86). Along with Gunnar Myrdal, Titmuss was also one of the first\nto use the term \u2018underclass\u2019 in the modern period (Myrdal, 1963: 19). Titmuss\nnoted that the Beveridge principle of universality could not by itself solve the\nproblems of the \u2018underclass\u2019, the fifth or quarter of the population who were\nbadly educated, poorly housed, inadequately fed, and who had greater need of\nmedical services. Titmuss observed that technological change and the raising of\nentry barriers, known in the USA as \u2018credentialism\u2019, was creating \u2018a permanent\nunderclass of deprived citizens, uneducated, unattached and alternating between\napathetic resignation and frustrated violence\u2019 (1965: 357, 363). Titmuss seemed to\nbe using the phrase \u2018underclass\u2019 both in the structural sense implied by Myrdal,\nbut also in terms of the behavioural usage that was to become increasingly\ndominant from the early 1980s. Since people were uneducated, they had been\nleft behind by technological change and had become unattached, but they were\nalso apathetic, resigned, and potentially violent. What was surprising was that\nTitmuss seemed to believe that this was a permanent group that could not be\nretrained or re-educated.\nthe unknown titmuss 241\nBut, while Titmuss had engaged with debates about \u2018problem families\u2019 in\nthe late 1940s and early 1950s, he showed no inclination to get involved with the\n1960s equivalent \u2018underclass\u2019 concept \u2013 the notion of the \u2018culture of poverty\u2019. The\nanthropologist Oscar Lewis had first elaborated the idea of a \u2018culture of poverty\u2019\nin the late 1950s, based on fieldwork in Mexico, and was subsequently to test it out\nin Puerto Rico (Rigdon, 1988: 51\u201386). In the classic version, Lewis was to argue\nthat the \u2018culture of poverty\u2019 was both an adaptation and reaction of the poor to\ntheir marginal position in capitalist societies. But it was also passed down from\ngeneration to generation because of its effect on the children. Moreover it was\nassociated with various traits that included \u2018a strong present-time orientation\nwith relatively little ability to defer gratification and to plan for the future, a\nsense of resignation and fatalism, a widespread belief in male superiority, and a\nhigh tolerance for psychological pathology of all sorts\u2019 (Lewis, 1967: xliv). The\ndebates about the \u2018culture of poverty\u2019 are extensive, and have been covered by\nother writers. What is interesting is that, unusually, Titmuss did not intervene.\nThe Titmuss papers show that he was aware, for example, of the work of Peter\nMarris, formerly of the Institute of Community Studies, who had argued that\nattempts at urban renewal were being frustrated by what he called the \u2018culture of\nslums\u2019.14 This seems to be a case of Titmuss ignoring, if not actively dismissing,\na behavioural interpretation of poverty and deprivation.\nIn his apparent rejection of the idea of the \u2018culture of poverty\u2019, Titmuss\nseemed to be at one with the British social policy community. On the other hand,\nTitmuss did intervene in the debates about the Moynihan Report (1965). The\nbackground to the Moynihan Report and the furore it created has been well-\ncovered (Rainwater and Yancey, 1967). William Julius Wilson has suggested that\nthe storm that followed the publication of the Report deterred liberal scholars\nfrom studying the problems of the inner cities for decades (Wilson, 1991: 4). As\nAssistant Secretary of Labor, and Director of the Office of Policy Planning and\nResearch, Daniel Patrick Moynihan produced his report on the Negro family,\noriginally for internal use. Moynihan argued that there was much evidence to\nsuggest that \u2018Negro social structure, in particular the Negro family, battered and\nharassed by discrimination, injustice, and uprooting, is in the deepest trouble\u2019\n(1965: 3\u201314). A quarter of urban Negro marriages were dissolved, one in four\nNegro births were illegitimate, and a quarter of Negro families were headed by\nfemales. At the centre of the \u2018tangle of pathology\u2019 was the weakness of family\nstructure. This was \u2018the principal source of most of the aberrant, inadequate,\nor anti-social behaviour that did not establish, but now serves to perpetuate\nthe cycle of poverty and deprivation\u2019 (1965: 30\u201345). While the report argued\nthat \u2018distortions\u2019 were structural, in much of its analysis it reflected the earlier\ninterpretation of E. Franklin Frazier, and Kenneth Clark\u2019s book Dark Ghetto. The\nresponse has been well documented (Rainwater and Yancey, 1967: 462; Valentine,\n1968: 31\u20135).\n242 john welshman\nThe point here is to show that Titmuss was sympathetic to the Moynihan\nReport. Titmuss had met Moynihan in London in the summer of 1964. The\nnext contact was in November 1965, when Moynihan sent Titmuss a copy of his\nreport. Titmuss told Moynihan his report on the Negro family was \u2018one of the\nmost impressive pieces of documentary writing I have come across for years\u2019.\nHe wrote \u2018You have a gift for combining hard statistical facts, a strong sense\nof history, and a human understanding of the people you are writing about\u2019.15\nTitmuss (who was on the National Committee for Commonwealth Immigrants)\nobserved that Britain was struggling with similar problems, though their scale\nand nature was different to the USA. There was not the same sense of \u2018abject\nhelplessness\u2019; family life was more stable; and unemployment was not a problem\nif thought of in terms of unskilled jobs. Titmuss did think there were similarities\nin national attitudes.16 In fact, Titmuss sympathised with Moynihan about the\nhostile reception his report received. Writing in January 1966, he wrote \u2018it is a\ntragic business and I sympathise with you profoundly . . . I sincerely hope that\nthe leaders of our \u201ccivil rights movement\u201d will be a little more responsible\u2019.17\nAlan Deacon has argued a focus upon personal responsibility and reciprocity\nran directly counter to the Titmuss paradigm which dominated academic\nthinking about social policy for much of the post-war period. In that respect\nthe row over Sir Keith Joseph\u2019s \u2018cycle of deprivation\u2019 in the early 1970s seems\nsimilar to the void created by the publication of the Moynihan Report in the\nUSA (Deacon, 2000: 9). But the evidence of a link between Titmuss and the\nMoynihan Report undermines this argument. If Titmuss was so opposed to\npersonal responsibility and reciprocity, why did he appear to be congratulating\nMoynihan on his report, and commiserating with him on the reception that\nit received? Titmuss would have been impressed with Moynihan\u2019s advocacy of\nEuropean style family allowances, and emphasis on employment for black men.\nBut we would expect him to have baulked at the reference to the \u2018tangle of\npathology\u2019 and the notion of a \u2018cycle of poverty and disadvantage\u2019. Titmuss\u2019s\ncorrespondence with Moynihan is surprising, and at the very least indicates that\nDeacon\u2019s portrayal of the debate over the Moynihan Report as analogous to that\nover the \u2018cycle of deprivation\u2019 requires some qualification. It suggests further\nthat the idea of a \u2018Titmuss paradigm\u2019 may be more misleading than helpful;\nthe Moynihan Report may not mark a turning point as has been suggested;\nand that the \u2018void\u2019 argument may mask other continuities in both Britain and\nthe USA.\nFinally, there are hints in the later lectures that Titmuss began to doubt his\nearlier visions of the welfare state, and suspect that some service users could be\ntroublesome. In April 1967, Titmuss noted that modern society was finding it\nincreasingly difficult to identify the \u2018causal agent or agencies\u2019 of diswelfare, and\nit was because of this that social services were necessary. He argued that \u2018non-\ndiscriminating universalist services are in part the consequence of unidentifiable\nthe unknown titmuss 243\ncausality\u2019 (1968: 134). Titmuss noted that the next question was whether it was\npossible to distinguish between \u2018faults in the individual\u2019 \u2013 moral, psychological,\nor social \u2013 and the \u2018faults of society\u2019. But this question remained unanswered.\nThe real challenge identified was to develop \u2018socially acceptable selective services\naiming to discriminate positively, with the minimum risk of stigma, in favour\nof those whose needs are greatest\u2019 (1968: 135). Thus Titmuss raised, but left\nunanswered, the question of whether it was possible to distinguish between\n\u2018faults in the individual\u2019 and the \u2018faults of society\u2019. In his last book, Titmuss\nconceded that poorer people were resorting to tax avoidance and evasion,\nincluding \u2018moonlighting\u2019, converting cash income into benefits in kind, and\nundisclosed earnings, though in this they were simply emulating the behaviour\nof the better-off (Abel Smith and Titmuss, 1974: 127\u20138). Therefore Titmuss\u2019s\nacknowledgements that there could be \u2018faults in the individual\u2019, and poor people\nmight act in a self-interested way, sit oddly with the argument that his neglect of\nagency left his analysis vulnerable to right-wing commentators in the 1980s.\nConclusion\nThis article has been concerned with re-examining the approach of Richard\nTitmuss to behaviour, structure, and poverty in the light of an emerging\ninterpretation of both the \u2018Titmuss paradigm\u2019 and social administration in\nthe post-war period. It is clear that some caution is necessary. Titmuss was\nunsystematic in his thinking, and inconsistent in his approach to issues\nof behaviour. What we might call the vocabulary of poverty needs careful\ninterpretation. And Titmuss occupied a number of different though not\nnecessarily exclusive positions, as would be inevitable in the case of any indivi-\ndual over a 30-year period. But the evidence presented here suggests some\nqualifications to the interpretation outlined by earlier writers, and indicates\nthat their portrayal of Titmuss needs to be substantially revised. What is obvious\nis the importance of locating Titmuss\u2019s thinking within its proper historical\ncontext. Titmuss was clearly interested in behaviour over and above his belief\nin altruism. It seems that what he was essentially trying to do was to make\nothers aware of the broader context in which human behaviour had to be\nanalysed. Titmuss made serious efforts to shift the discussion from individualist\nand behavioural explanations of poverty, taking the Tawney and Mannheim\npositions, that behaviour was a factor in the causes of poverty, but by no means\nthe only one. This was what he seemed to be attempting to do in the inaugural\nlecture. He was doing this against an ideological background in which ideas of\nsocial pathology remained important. Older ideas of a deserving or undeserving\npoor, and of the importance of character, had been replaced in the 1950s by a\npsychoanalytical approach, which was different in origin and methodology, but\nsimilarly individualist in its focus on parents and families. Thus an approach that\n244 john welshman\nhas been viewed as vulnerable to the approach of conservative commentators in\nthe 1980s, was in itself a reaction to an earlier and then still current behavioural\nanalysis.\nWhat then, are the implications of this analysis for Titmuss\u2019s reputation as\na seminal thinker on social policy issues? Does this evidence alter, in subtle but\nimportant ways, the way that we see him? Titmuss is much more cited than read,\nand a close reading of even well-known books such as Problems of Social Policy\nsuggest a more nuanced position than previous writers have realised. This is\nsupported by the evidence of other less well-known writings, minor pieces, and\nby the Titmuss papers and other archival evidence. If Titmuss did not confront\nissues of behaviour, structure, and poverty directly head-on as much as he might\nhave done, he was clearly aware of the importance of such debates. However,\nwhile he wrestled with these issues, he failed to resolve them, and seemed unable\nto move to a convincing position that combined behavioural and structural\ncauses of poverty, and addressed agency. This was because he tended to equate\nideas of agency with an interpretation of poverty that linked it to dysfunctional\nbehaviour, and downplayed the role of structural factors. Thus, if Titmuss did\nmore than anyone else to create a paradigm, it was one that he ultimately seemed\nconstrained by. Even so, it is arguable that his less well-known writing is relevant\nto recent thinking, and to the search for a new research paradigm that might\nbridge the dichotomy between agency and structure. What is clear is that debates\nabout behaviour, structure, and poverty have been marked as much by continuity\nas by change.\nNotes\nThe Titmuss papers are those in the possession of Ann Oakley (AO), and those at the British\nLibrary of Political and Economic Science (LSE).\n1 Titmuss papers (AO), box file \u20181942\u201348\u2019, R.
