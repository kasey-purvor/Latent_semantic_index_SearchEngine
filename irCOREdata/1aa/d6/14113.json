An additional project aim was to assess the sustainability of\nthe developments initiated by the e-developers in terms of their ongoing maintenance and\ndevelopment by the course teams they supported and worked alongside.\nLiterature review\nThree strands of literature were identified for this literature review: the impact of technol-\nogy on learning; support for blended learning; and professional\/staff development for\nacademic staff and for technology support staff.\n*Corresponding author. Email: lmburke@btinternet.com\n112  A. Ooms et al.\nThere is a growing literature related to the positive impact of technology on learning\nin schools, colleges and universities, the need for appropriate staff development for both\neducators and learning technologists and the emerging and diverse roles of learning\ntechnologists and how they support educators. \nWhen applied to well-defined educational objectives, and integrated into the curriculum by\ntrained teachers, education technology can produce dramatic results for students. (CEO Forum\nSchool Technology 2001, 6)\nResearchers have shown that new instructional approaches are necessary to enable\ntechnology integration (Borko 2004; Zhao et al. 2002) because the use of technology does\nnot automatically impact on faculty members\u2019 overall approach to teaching (Cuban 2000).\nTherefore, as teachers and lecturers make extensive use of technology, they need to confront\nthe tension between traditional and new pedagogic methods.\nOn average, educational institutions in the UK invest 5.6% of their total budget in\ntechnology (UCISA 2006); however, for that investment to be returned, they also need to\ncommit to professional development by providing the required support, resources and time\nfor teachers to learn how to use technology. Several essential elements of professional\ndevelopment to support integration of technology have been identified in previous research.\nOne of those essential elements is release time (Pajo and Wallace 2001; Thurlow 1999).\nEducators are expected to learn both technical skills and pedagogical strategies, and that\nrequires an enormous amount of time. The issue of insufficient time is a major barrier for\neducators\u2019 use of technology because of contextual factors such as the structure of timeta-\nbles and workload (Cuban, Kirkpatrick, and Peck 2001; Pajo and Wallace 2001; O\u2019Neill,\nSingh, and O\u2019Donoghue 2004), as well as the competing demand of time in terms of teach-\ning versus research.\nSeveral researchers have identified access to hardware and software at home (Adamy\n2000; Cathings and MacGregor 2000; Norum, Grabinger, and Duffield 1999; Thurlow\n1999) and in the institution (Thurlow 1999) as other essential elements for effective profes-\nsional development. Official recognition of efforts to integrate technology is important as\nwell. This can take on multiple formats, such as providing financial incentives and rewards,\nand provision of education credits and certification endorsement (Pajo and Wallace 2001;\nThurlow 1999). Technical support for troubleshooting technical problems as they arise\n(Adamy 2000; Pajo and Wallace 2001; Thurlow 1999) is yet another essential element of\nsupport, as is follow-up training and ongoing mentor support (Chuang, Thompson, and\nSchmidt 2003; Cole, Simkins, and Penul 2002; Pajo and Wallace 2001; Polselli 2002; Sugar\n2005; Swan et al. 2002; Thurlow 1999).\nA critical factor for the effective implementation of e-learning in universities is the\ndevelopment of academic staff. Bates (2000) suggests that faculty development seems to\nwork best when supported by a range of strategies, including staff incentives, staff support\nand professional development. Kenny (2002) suggests that support required for staff to\nadapt can be under-estimated and under-resourced. As Laurillard (2001) argues, innovation\nin course design is conditional on staff development and upskilling; new kinds of pedagogy\nrequire new knowledge.\nEffective professional development balances equipping lecturers with basic technical\nskills with strategies to integrate technology (Thurlow 1999). Lecturers\u2019 diverse technology\nbackgrounds need to be considered, and individualised professional development plans\nprovided (Thurlow 1999). Such individualised professional development plans can be\nsupported through mentor-schemes (Fleming 1999; Sugar 2005; Thurlow 1999). Recently,\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   113\nresearchers argue that professional development of educators requires situative professional\ndevelopment to promote technology integration (Hughes and Ooms 2004; Holmes 2004;\nPutnam and Borko 2000; Swan et al. 2000; Zhao et al. 2002). According to Putnam and\nBorko (2000) there are three conceptual themes central to situative learning: \n(1) cognition is situated in particular physical and social contexts;\n(2) it is social in nature; and\n(3) knowledge is distributed across the individual, others, and tools.\nIn higher education, such professional education is important for academics and for the\ntechnological staff who support them. Appropriate technological and pedagogic training\nand education for e-developers is also important (Hannon 2008; Oliver et al. 2004; HEFCE\n2005).\nA study was undertaken in 2004\u201306 of the work of the learning technologists at an\neducational technology unit at a university in Australia who supported academic staff in\ntheir e-learning developments (Hannon 2008). This was a limited, small study and it seemed\nuseful to undertake a larger study at a university which had a similar central educational\ndevelopment unit and who provided e-learning support to academics.\nThe case study\nContext\nThe decision to purchase and support Blackboard as the university Virtual Learning\nEnvironment (VLE) was made in July 2000. At the same time the first institutional Learning\nand Teaching Strategy was developed which contained targets for the implementation,\nuse and support of the institutional VLE. Staff development was seen as a crucial element\nto the successful implementation of the VLE and this was a priority for the educational\ntechnology unit, which had been set up in May 2000. Seven faculty-based educational\ntechnology leaders were therefore appointed that year and seconded for 40% of their time\nto roll out the use of the VLE and carry out the necessary staff development within their\nfaculties.\nAn evaluation conducted by the university (Linsey, Katsifli, and Gipps 2005) showed\nthat by 2005, 2000 modules were available in Blackboard with some level of online support\nat the university, that 99% of the students were using Blackboard at least once a week and\n88% of them felt that Blackboard had made a significant contribution to their studies.\nHowever, further evaluation revealed that the use of Blackboard had not affected faculty\nmembers\u2019 overall approach to teaching and that staff were using the system primarily with\nexisting teaching materials. It was therefore proposed that further development was needed\nto encourage staff to address pedagogical issues and improve blended learning.\nIn September 2005, three e-developers were appointed for one year to support the inte-\ngration of blended learning with this resource shared equally between faculties. The term\n\u2018e-developer\u2019 was chosen by the university and is equated to the role of learning technolo-\ngist as described by Oliver (2002). The e-developer role involved engaging in a range of\nactivities including: \n\u25cf staff development in both the pedagogic and technical aspects of the VLE;\n\u25cf pedagogical support and advice to academic staff; and\n\u25cf technical support.\n114  A. Ooms et al.\nThe e-developer met regularly with individual academics or module teams to convert\nmodules that were traditionally delivered face-to-face into blended learning modules\ncombining some aspects of face-to-face delivery and a significant amount of online learning\nactivities.\nThe objectives of the first year of this programme were to support the development of\nsustainable e-learning content resources and activities across faculties, to develop strategic\nexemplars and to provide a model for faculties in terms of their own blended learning  strat-\negies. The term blended learning can refer to a number of activities where a range of teach-\ning and learning approaches are employed in the delivery of education. For this case study,\nthe term refers to replacing a certain amount of face-to-face, largely didactic classroom\nactivities with a range of interactive, constructivist online learning activities using the\nuniversity\u2019s VLE. It was hoped that the modules developed would serve as catalysts for\ndevelopment of additional blended learning modules by faculties, who would then fund\ntheir own academic learning resource developers. The academic team would provide the\nsubject specialist content and work collaboratively with the e-developers to reach a consen-\nsus about design, technological development, and pedagogical approach. Educational tech-\nnology leaders also had a role, which was to help identify projects, coordinate projects, set\nup meetings, act as point of contact in the faculty, and follow up issues of concern.\nFaculties were invited to select a project that they deemed most suitable for conversion\ninto a blended learning format. The project had to meet criteria which were: the project\nneeded to include both content and activities; it should have executive support; and there\nshould be agreement to sustain the project for two years. It was agreed that each faculty\nwould effectively receive 50% of an e-developer\u2019s time. However it was made clear that\nthey were a central team as the Academic Development Centre (ADC) wanted them to focus\non the project aims of improving blended learning, and creating innovation. It was also\nhoped that the modules would serve as catalysts for development of additional modules by\nfaculties, who would then fund their own academic learning resource developers.\nTheoretical background\nThe theoretical underpinning for this case study is based upon Land (2004), who examined\nwhat educational developers see as the main issues that need to be addressed in their work\nand the impact of educational context and culture on their practice.\nLand (2004) found that an issue for these developers is how change in learning and\nteaching can be made in organisations that have well-established academic cultures and\npractices and which may have conflicting priorities.\nIn planning the case study presented here, the researchers set out to uncover not only\nwhat the educational developers saw as their role within the organisation (as Land did), but\nalso how others, especially academic staff who worked with these developers, saw the\nrole of educational developers within the academic community and the university as an\norganisation.\nMethodology\nIn 2006, the university\u2019s Academic Development Centre (ADC) was asked to carry out an\nevaluative research project to assess the effectiveness of the \u2018e-developer model\u2019 in terms\nof engagement of staff with blended learning, dissemination of good practice and the\nsustainability of the projects. The study was designed to examine how the e-developers\nworked collaboratively with academic staff, and also the perceptions of the e-developer\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   115\nmodel held by academic staff, e-developers themselves and educational technology leaders\nin each faculty.\nThe model of evaluation that was adopted was that of realistic evaluation (Pawson and\nTilley 1997). Realistic evaluation follows a \u2018realist\u2019 ontology, objective epistemology, and\nnaturalistic sets of methodologies (as opposed to experiment or quasi-experiment). The\nbasic postulate of \u2018realistic evaluation\u2019 is that \nprograms work (\u2018have successful outcomes\u2019) only in so far as they introduce the appropriate\nideas and opportunities (\u2018mechanisms\u2019) to groups in the appropriate social and cultural condi-\ntions (\u2018contexts\u2019). (Pawson and Tilley 1997, 57)\nThe aim of \u2018realistic evaluation\u2019 is to give a detailed account of what worked, for whom,\nand under what circumstances.\nThe evaluation was therefore grounded in the perspectives of the participants in the\nprogramme. In other words, the judgements of how well the programme fared in terms of\nengagement, influence, and sustainability, and the criteria used to make these judgements,\nwere those of the programme participants. The evaluation therefore explored the views\nof the principal groups involved in the programme, namely: course teams, educational\ntechnology leaders, the e-developers and the strategic leads within the ADC.\nFour main areas for exploration were identified from the literature, in discussions with\nstrategic ADC staff and from the e-developer programme documentation. These areas were:\nengagement, styles of working, influence, and sustainability. \n\u25cf Engagement (how have staff engaged with the projects?);\n\u25cf Styles of working (what styles of working \u2018worked\u2019 across the different projects\/\nfaculties? What has been the role of the educational technology leaders?);\n\u25cf Influence (how influential have the e-developer projects been in the faculties?);\n\u25cf Sustainability (how sustainable are the processes initiated by the e-developers? Are\nthe \u2018e-developer resources\u2019 being used and developed by staff?).\nTo understand the perspectives of participants in the e-developer projects, a qualitative eval-\nuation method was chosen. The specific choice of method was guided primarily by the\nanticipation of the richness (or otherwise) of the data that interviews with different groups\nyield. The interviews were therefore semi-structured, with questions asked around the main\nareas identified above.\nInterviews were carried out with the Associate Head of ADC, course team members\n(n = 19, typically in pairs), a group interview with the educational technology leaders (n = 7)\nand a group interview with the e-developers (n = 3). Interview data were then entered in the\nqualitative data analysis software, NVivo, to identify themes arising from the data.\nResults and discussion\nThe analysis focused on the four identified themes of engagement, styles of working, influ-\nence, and sustainability, per blended learning project.\nEngagement\nEngagement during the project (i.e. regular meetings between the course team and the e-\ndevelopers) was a major factor contributing to the success of the projects. Projects during\n116  A. Ooms et al.\nwhich people were more engaged were more successful and were perceived as being\nmore enjoyable and more influential. Crucial factors mentioned by course developers that\nfostered their engagement during the projects were the personalities of the e-developers,\ninvolvement of the educational technology leaders, and feedback from the students.\nMotivation for engaging in a blended learning project varied across the different facul-\nties. Motivation can be categorised into intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Different kinds\nof motivation for engaging in a blended learning project, intrinsic or extrinsic, did not seem\nto have had an influence on the perceived success of the project.\nThe majority of academic staff agreed that the e-developers\u2019 involvement in the projects\nmade a difference both to the engagement of staff directly involved and those not involved\nwith blended learning. One stated, \u2018Staff involved with the project appreciated the time and\nprofessional results from the e-developer\u2019s input\u2019.\nStrategic staff agreed that the e-developers\u2019 involvement in the projects made a differ-\nence to how staff directly involved in the projects think about their teaching but were neutral\nabout this impact for staff not directly involved with the projects. One staff member said\nthat: \nStaff are becoming aware of the potential and many will incorporate material into teaching\nprogrammes incrementally. The availability of e-developers enabled staff to begin to think\nmore strategically about blended learning. It is important this support is available consistently\nand not on a \u2018fragmented\u2019 basis. E-developers gave a useful independent (student?) perspective\nof material.\nStyles of working\nAlthough opinions about what worked well were sometimes contradictory among the\nstaff members in the different faculties, there was some agreement on the positive charac-\nteristics of the programme. The involvement of the educational technology leaders was\nmentioned as important for several of the projects. However, this was not a crucial compo-\nnent for the success of all projects. For example, for one very successful e-learning project\nthere had been little involvement of the educational technology leader. The support of the\nAssociate Head of ADC was mentioned as crucial for one project. Additionally, seeing what\nworks and showcasing projects within the faculties were mentioned as approaches that\nworked well to create an interest in the faculties among people who were initially not\ninvolved.\nMost respondents generally agreed, however, that the positive elements of the programme\nrevolved around the e-developers\u2019 characteristics. Appreciated were their: \n\u25cf \u2018flexibility and availability\u2019\n\u25cf \u2018reliability and efficiency\u2019\n\u25cf \u2018technical knowledge\u2019\n\u25cf skill at passing on \u2018ideas about the best ways to deliver the materials\u2019\n\u25cf ability to \u2018absorb the content of the modules\u2019\n\u25cf \u2018provision of right solutions\u2019\n\u25cf \u2018encouragement\u2019\n\u25cf \u2018talent, creativity and enthusiasm\u2019\n\u25cf \u2018sensitivity to the uniqueness of schools\/faculties\u2019\n\u25cf \u2018good response time\u2019\n\u25cf \u2018comfortable manageable style of working\u2019\n\u25cf presentation of \u2018interesting alternatives to conventional quizzes\u2019\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   117\nOverall, the e-developers appeared to act as role models\/mentors for e-development and\nwere given considerable credit for the success of the individual projects: \nWithout them \u2013 the e-developers \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t have been able to move forward with this project.\nThe e-developer programme was also described by academic staff as \u2018a catalyst\u2019 and\n\u2018speeded up things\u2019, according to one academic staff member.\nPreferences in communication methods between the e-developers and the course team\nmembers varied. The communication method preferred by most participants was face-to-\nface meetings. A few people commented negatively about the efficiency of communication\nby e-mail due to slow response times of the e-developers, whereas this communication\nmethod worked well for others.\nThree areas of debate emerged related to styles of working. One issue was about whether\nthe e-developers should be based at the central ADC, or within their designated faculty.\nAnother issue was about working with individual members of staff versus working with a\nteam of course developers. The third issue was about the role and input the educational tech-\nnology leaders had in the projects. Some educational technology leaders were more involved\nthan others and quantity and quality of involvement varied greatly. Some educational\ntechnology leaders were not involved at all. One member of staff said that the educational\ntechnology leaders informed them about the project but \u2018\u2026did no more than that\u2019.\nOther educational technology leaders were very involved and worked together with the\ncourse developer as a team. Although the educational technology lead was the first port of\ncall or link, some were only marginally involved in the projects.\nAdditionally, staff members were unclear about the role of the educational technology\nleaders: \nIt took me a while to work this out, that he was the person to approach for help with blended\nlearning in the faculty\u2026\nIf I had known he was in charge, I would have had fewer scruples to ask him and bother him.\nOther factors also undermined the success, and even prevented the progress of the projects.\nThese included scepticism towards blended learning, or misunderstandings about what\nblended learning is. However, the main undermining factors were lack of time and unclear\nexpectations. Every faculty member involved in a blended learning project said they under-\nestimated the time involved in the project. \nIt requires immense time of preparation to provide materials to e-developers.\nSome projects also progressed slowly because academic staff did not provide materials to\ne-developers on time. Academic staff reported that they are \u2018burdened with other things\u2019.\nSeveral mention the idea of giving release time for academic staff involved in development.\nA factor that limited the success of one project was the perceived late announcement of the\nblended learning project, which prevented one faculty to adequately plan: \nIt was not given adequate planning time with respect to academics\u2019 time. Academics\u2019\ntimetables are already set for next year and once set they are relatively inflexible.\nThere were several issues that caused problems at the beginning stage of the projects. The\ne-developers overestimated academic staff members\u2019 skills and knowledge of technology.\nOne staff member reported: \n118  A. Ooms et al.\nAt the beginning it was quite difficult for me to get into it, the problem was that they (the\ne-developers) assumed too much knowledge from me, that I knew about blended learning.\nThere was also a problem of unclear expectations where academic staff hoped that the\ne-developers would: \nadd interactive in addition to static material (but) \u2026 We had to do it on our own.\nIf e-developers had clarified from the beginning what was expected from us that would have\nmade it easier for us.\nThis understandably contributed to misconceptions about responsibilities and workload.\nLikewise, there was little clarity among the academic staff about the ability, commitment,\ntime availability and organisational structure of the e-developers\u2019 roles. One of the\nacademic staff members said: \nI wanted them to develop it \u2026 [I gave the e-developer] a pile of things to read \u2026 I have not\nseen her since \u2026 there was no clarity as to precisely what their ability might be \u2026 I don\u2019t think\nwe knew precisely what their role was either.\nStaff agreed that the way the e-developers collaborated with staff on the projects was\nsuccessful in helping meet the aims of the projects. One member of staff said: \nThere was good rapport between e-developers and faculty staff. Progress between meetings\nwas significant and the meetings permitted evaluation and updating of project implementation.\nInfluence\nWith the exception of one project, at the time of the evaluation it was too early to tell if, and\nto what extent, the blended learning project had had an impact on student learning. This will\nbe the subject of a further evaluative project. However, most people involved believed in\nthe potential of that impact.\nThe project has had an impact on the modules: \nIt raises the level of our materials by adding to the resources.\nThe module was improved through this format.\nOne member of staff said that the impact was great because external colleagues are now\npurchasing their blended learning product. One particular blended learning module was\nsubsequently implemented in several other courses so those courses could also benefit from\nthe project.\nThe project also had an impact on staff, including: \n\u25cf raised awareness;\n\u25cf fostered communication among staff, including cross-faculty\/cross-discipline; and\n\u25cf increased interest among staff who were not directly involved.\nStaff also indicated that they were starting to think and talk about applying blended learning\nstrategies to other modules. Presentations about the projects had been attended by staff with\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   119\nmuch interest and some of the staff involved had been contacted by staff not currently\ninvolved to talk about potential blended learning projects. One academic reported that a\ncolleague said, \u2018Oh, I want to do that, oooh, that is good\u2019.\nOne course was implemented whilst still in the process of being created. Academic staff\nworking on this particular project received verbal and non-verbal feedback from students\nand they reported the following impressions they had: \n\u25cf Students worked harder on this module because they had to keep up with the online\ntesting;\n\u25cf Students enjoyed the variety of formats;\n\u25cf Students were more positive about the content than previously;\n\u25cf Students booked video rooms to view videos together, a sign of more collaborative\nlearning among the students;\n\u25cf The blended learning component helped students with time management because in\norder to meet the deadlines, they had to plan their time more efficiently;\n\u25cf Student performance improved from the previous year.\nOne academic mentioned that she is thinking of developing her own technical skills now\nbecause she does not want to be dependent on e-developers. However, she realises that she\nwill need technical assistance for a while before she can do this.\nPerceptions about the influence of the projects varied among the strategic faculty staff.\nOne faculty staff member said: \nThere is the potential to be influential. The \u2026 project has had a very positive impact. It\u2019s ease\nof use and obvious use as a teaching resource has shown how blended learning can have huge\nadded value. The skills resource is very much \u2018work in progress\u2019 on an ambitious project, and\nongoing support is essential for it to have general influence.\nOne final area of influence was in the mentorship role played by the e-developers, serving\nas a guide\/role model for good pedagogic practices through the technology: \nAs a model of what can be achieved, this \u2026 has provided both inspiration and insight into the\nuse of blended resource materials. It is hoped that the sustainable nature of the project will\nallow dissemination of the approach across the whole faculty.\nSustainability\nSustainability was a major concern for all people involved. All academic staff believed that\nthe blended learning components could not be sustained without the e-developers. Most\npeople expressed concerns about availability of support and lack of time and knowledge of\nstaff. \n(Blended learning) will stall without e-developer input \u2026 it takes significant time to maintain,\nmore than a face to face mode.\nThey also expressed concerns about updating\/upgrading the current modules because the\nshelf-life of materials varies and staff turnover was a concern, resulting in different teaching\nstyles and different approaches to the subject. Furthermore, multimedia resources age very\nquickly. Concerns about sustainability had an impact on the effort made towards these\nprojects. One person reported: \n120  A. Ooms et al.\nWhy should we bother to produce a project that isn\u2019t going to be resourced at all?\nLack of time is also an obstacle for further development of existing project or for develop-\nment of new projects: However, others stated: \nThe use of university-based e-developers has advantages (more people equals a broader range\nof expertise) and disadvantages (there are conflicting demands on their time). The faculty has\n(as a result of this project) requested funding to have a faculty-based e-developer alongside the\nuniversity provision. This will broaden the range of support available and provide dedicated\nstaff for maintenance of interface to the material and content.\nOverall, academic staff were extremely positive about their experience with their work with\nthe e-developer. Staff described it as a learning experience and identified the value of the\nenthusiasm and fun that the projects generated. The e-developers were described as good\nrole models. However, some unanticipated aspects of the blended learning projects were\nidentified, including the need for the projects to be better resourced and more tightly struc-\ntured, that the work was slower than was hoped and that, although pleased with the end\nresults, there was more work for academic staff than they had anticipated.\nConclusion\nThis paper has explored the introduction of technology in higher education, and the way in\nwhich roles and practices influenced this process. The findings suggest that the characteris-\ntics of e-developers that are associated with success of the projects are their engagement\nwith academic staff, and their enthusiasm and pedagogic and technical skill. The involve-\nment of the educational technology leaders, though valued where it did take place, was not\na crucial component of success in all cases.\nCrucial factors mentioned by course developers that fostered their engagement during\nthe projects were the personalities of the e-developers and feedback from the students. The\nsuccess factor that most respondents agreed on was that the programme revolved around the\ne-developers\u2019 positive characteristics and the e-developers were given considerable credit\nfor the success of the individual projects.\nThe most common reasons that limited, or prevented, the completion of projects were\nlack of communication, differing expectations and misconceptions about the knowledge and\nskills of the e-developers, and scope of the project itself. Other issues that impeded the\ndevelopment of the projects were academic staff not providing materials to e-developers on\ntime; e-developers overestimating staff members\u2019 skills and knowledge of technology; and\nmisconceptions about responsibilities and workload. Additionally, more general factors that\nundermined success included scepticism towards blended learning and misunderstandings\nabout what blended learning is.\nAlthough at the time of the evaluation it was too early to tell if, and to what extent, the\nblended learning project had had an impact on student learning, most people involved were\npositive about the potential of that impact.\nSustainability of these initiatives is a major concern for all people involved. All partici-\npating academic staff members believe that these blended learning initiatives cannot be\nsustained without the e-developers. Most people also expressed concerns about availability\nof support and lack of time and knowledge of staff if these projects are left to faculties to\ndevelop.\nThis research project has supported the importance of staff development emphasised in\nthe literature. However, it offers an alternative organisational perspective and model of\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   121\ndevelopment that does not involve taking academic staff out of the teaching area to\nprovide this development. The e-developers can provide development within the context\nthat academics are working in on real problems, thereby supporting situative professional\ndevelopment, which helps promote technology integration into teaching. In addition, the\ne-developers provided cost-effective mentorship which participants believed would have a\npositive impact on student learning.\nReferences\nAdamy, P. 2000.
