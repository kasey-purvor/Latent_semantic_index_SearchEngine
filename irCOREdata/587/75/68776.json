We derive exact analytic conditions that allow\nthe prediction of OD through the two known bifurcation routes, in the same model, and for\ndifferent numbers of coupled oscillators. Our exact analytic results enable us to generalize OD as\na multiparameter-sensitive phenomenon. It can be induced, not only by changes in couplings, but\nalso by changes in the oscillator frequencies or amplitudes. We observe synchronization transitions\nas a function of coupling and confirm the robustness of the phenomena in the presence of noise.\nNumerical and analogue simulations are in good agreement with the theory.\nCopyright c\u00a9 EPLA, 2009\nCoupled-oscillator systems exhibit a variety of phenom-\nena relevant to physics, biology, and other branches\nof science and technology. Here, we study oscillation\ndeath (OD)1, a form of synchronization [1] in which the\noscillators interact in such a way as to quench each other\u2019s\noscillations [2\u20135]. This intriguing phenomenon was noted\nin the 19th century by Rayleigh [1], who found that adja-\ncent organ pipes of the same pitch can reduce each other to\nsilence. Since then, OD has been studied in diverse applica-\ntions including oceanography [6], chemical engineering [7],\nsolid-state lasers [8] and a variety of other experimental\nsystems [3,9\u201311]. OD is known to occur via two distinct\nbifurcation mechanisms: i) Hopf bifurcation, where the\ncoupling induces stability at the origin of the phase space,\nthus collapsing the orbits to zero, which can happen only\nif the oscillators are sufficiently different [4,12\u201315] (or for\nidentical oscillators if there are delays [16,17] in the\ncoupling); or ii) for non-identical oscillators, saddle-node\nbifurcation [3] in which new fixed points appear on\/near\nthe coupled limit cycles, annihilating the periodic orbits.\nRecently, Karnatak et al. [18] were able to produce OD in\ntwo identical coupled oscillators through the saddle-node\nroute, using dissimilar non-delayed coupling.\nIn this letter, we show that a coupled-oscillator system,\nwhich has been used extensively in modeling coupled\n(a)E-mail: jjsuarez@ivic.ve\n1Sometimes known as amplitude death, which can be misleading\nwhere death occurs at finite oscillation amplitude.\nrhythmic processes in mathematics, physics and biol-\nogy [19] can undergo OD via both bifurcation routes. We\nobtain exact analytic conditions for OD, and compare the\ntheory with numerical simulations and analogue electronic\nexperiments. We thus generalize OD as a phenomenon\nthat occurs, not only through coupling-increased dissipa-\ntivity [1], but also when a measure of dispersion among\nthe parameters of the coupled system is exceeded [20].\nWe also show that, near the onset of death, the coupled\nsystem alternates between periodic, quasiperiodic and\neven chaotic behavior, reflecting the complex temporal\nvariability observed in real biological systems [21,22].\nOur model is a set of five coupled oscillators that\nsuccessfully reproduces many phenomena seen in the\ncardiovascular system (CVS), e.g., modulation [23] and\nsynchronization [24]. Each oscillator has its own char-\nacteristic frequency and amplitude [25] (see table 1)\nand emulates a particular physiological function. Heart\nand respiration are obvious physiological processes;\nthe myogenic oscillation is related to the intrinsic self-\nregulatory activity of the smooth muscle tissue in the\nwalls of the blood vessels; the neurogenic oscillation is\nassociated with the neural control by the central nervous\nsystem; and the nitric oxide related endothelial oscillation\nis associated with metabolic activity mediated by the\nendothelial tissue that lines the whole CVS2.\n2The additional nitric oxide independent endothelial oscillatory\nprocess at about 0.007Hz [25] does not affect the results reported in\nthis paper.\n38008-p1\nJ.

X and Y \u2208 Rm, and Pi,\nQi :R\nm\u2192R are scalar coupling functions. We suppose\nthat the inter-oscillator interactions can be approximated\nby a mean field, so that Pi(X,Y) =\n1\nm\n\u22115\nj=1 xj , and\nQi(X, Y ) = 0.\nWe now review briefly some basic concepts, assuming\nan autonomous n-dimensional dynamical system:\nZ\u02d9=F(Z), (2)\nwhere Z\u2208Rn and F :Rn\u2192Rn is a general non-linear\nvector function. All the points, Z\u2217, in phase space satis-\nfying the equation F(Z\u2217) = 0, are called fixed points of\nthe dynamical system (2). Their stability and quality can\nbe determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobi matrix,\nprovided their real parts are non-zero:\ndet\n{\n\u2202F(Z)\n\u2202Z\n|Z=Z\u2217 \u2212\u03bbI\n}\n= 0. (3)\nWe consider first the case of two coupled oscillators,\nmodelling, e.g., the cardio-respiratory interactions,\nx\u02d91 =\u2212x1\u03b1\n(\u221a\nx21+ y\n2\n1 \u2212 a1\n)\u2212 y1\u03c91+ \u01eb(x1+x2),\ny\u02d91 =\u2212y1\u03b1\n(\u221a\nx21+ y\n2\n1 \u2212 a1\n)\n+x1\u03c91,\nx\u02d92 =\u2212x2\u03b1\n(\u221a\nx22+ y\n2\n2 \u2212 a2\n)\u2212 y2\u03c92+ \u01eb(x1+x2),\ny\u02d92 =\u2212y2\u03b1\n(\u221a\nx22+ y\n2\n2 \u2212 a2\n)\n+x2\u03c92.\n(4)\nHere the origin is always a fixed point.

Thus, if\na2 >a1, then \u01eb <\u22122\u03b1a2 is a sufficient condition for OD.\nThis is the Hopf bifurcation route to OD, and it occurs\nonly for negative \u01eb.\nFor \u01eb > 0, there is a critical value \u01ebc such that, for\n\u01eb > \u01ebc, four new fixed points appear: two unstable and\ntwo asymptotically stable. In order to make numerical\nestimations from our model we make use of the extensive\nearlier research on the CV system [23,25] embodied in\nthe frequencies and amplitude relationships summarised\nin table 1, so that we take a1\/a5 \u2248 1, a1\/ai \u2248 0.5, for\ni= {2, 3, 4}.\nFigure 1 shows the bifurcation diagram for x1,\ncalculated for a1 = 0.5, a2 = 1, f1 = 1.1, f2 = 0.3 and\n\u03b1= 1. Note that for this range of \u01eb > 0 the origin is always\nan unstable fixed point. The end of the oscillations is\nmarked by the appearance of the new fixed points at\n\u01eb\u223c 3.578. They are obtained from the set of algebraic\n38008-p2\nDiverse routes to oscillation death in a coupled-oscillator system\nequations:\n\u2212x1\u03b1\n(\u221a\nx21+ y\n2\n1 \u2212 a1\n)\n\u2212 y1\u03c91+ \u01eb(x1+x2) = 0,\n\u2212y1\u03b1\n(\u221a\nx21+ y\n2\n1 \u2212 a1\n)\n+x1\u03c91 = 0,\n\u2212x2\u03b1\n(\u221a\nx22+ y\n2\n2 \u2212 a2\n)\n\u2212 y2\u03c92+ \u01eb(x1+x2) = 0,\n\u2212y2\u03b1\n(\u221a\nx22+ y\n2\n2 \u2212 a2\n)\n+x2\u03c92 = 0.\n(7)\nAfter some algebra, we obtain the relations:\n\u03c91(x\n2\n1+ y\n2\n1) = \u01eby1(x1+x2),\n\u03c92(x\n2\n2+ y\n2\n2) = \u01eby2(x1+x2).\n(8)\nThe analysis of eq. (8) combined with eq. (7) shows that,\nfor \u01eb\u226a 2\u03c91 and \u01eb\u226a 2\u03c92, the only fixed point is (0, 0,\n0, 0). For sufficiently large values of \u01eb, we obtain four new\nfixed points. The fixed points can appear only in pairs of\nstable-unstable points. This is the saddle-node bifurcation\nroute to OD, which occurs only for positive \u01eb.\nWe now define x1 = r1 cos (\u03a61), y1 = r1 sin (\u03a61), x2 =\nr2 cos (\u03a62), y2 = r2 sin (\u03a62), where r\n2\n1 = x\n2\n1+ y\n2\n1 , r\n2\n2 = x\n2\n2+\ny22 . As in our model \u03c91\u226b \u03c92, a2 >a1, which implies\n(x01)\n2\u226a (x02)2; where x0i and y0i are the system\u2019s fixed\npoints. From eq. (8) we obtain the equality\n\u03c92 = \u01eb cos (\u03a62) sin (\u03a62). (9)\nThis is equivalent to the equation\n2\u03c92\n\u01eb\n= sin (2\u03a62). (10)\nAs sin(2\u03a62)\u0002 1, this means that we have new solutions to\nthe algebraic equations (7) only when\n\u01eb > 2\u03c92. (11)\nEquation (11) provides a simple and understandable\nanalytic estimate of the critical value for the bifurcation.\nFigure 2 (top) illustrates a numerical simulation of the\ncoupled oscillators (4) near criticality, showing how the\noscillations evolve as \u01eb is increased by steps of 0.1. We\nhave established that, for the chosen parameter values,\nthe oscillations die when \u01ebc \u2248 3.578, gratifyingly close to\nthe \u01ebc \u2248 4\u03c0f2 = 3.77 predicted by (11). The difference\nis attributable to the approximations made in deriving\neq. (11). Using the same values of parameters, we also\nperformed numerical simulations for negative \u01eb, fig. 2\n(bottom), and found that OD occurs through supercritical\nHopf bifurcation when \u01eb\u223c\u22121.88, in agreement with the\ntheoretical prediction (6).\nWe have also used the above mathematical tools to\ninvestigate the full model [23] with five coupled oscillators\n(i= 1, . . . , 5). Solutions of the algebraic equations\n0 =\u2212xiqi\u2212 yi\u03c9i+ \u01eb\n5\u2211\nj=1\nxj ,\n0 =\u2212yiqi+xi\u03c9i,\n(12)\nFig. 2: (Colour on-line) Top: time series of x1(t) (bold curve)\nand x2(t) from numerical simulations of the system (4),\nshowing saddle-node OD. Parameter values were the same as\nin fig. 1. The dashed line shows the step-wise variation of\nthe coupling constant \u01eb in a positive range. Note that after\nOD has occurred lim\nt\u2192\u221e\n{x1(t), x2(t)}> 0. Bottom: time series of\nx1(t) and x2(t) from numerical simulations of the system (4),\nshowing supercritical Hopf bifurcation OD. Parameter values\nwere the same as in fig. 1. The diagonal stepped line starting\nat the origin indicates how \u01eb was varied in the negative range.\nIn this case lim\nt\u2192\u221e\n{x1(t), x2(t)}> 0, after OD has occurred.\nNote the difference in abscissa timescales between the top and\nbottom parts of the figure.\ncorrespond to the fixed points of (1) for five coupled\noscillators. After some calculations we get the equations\n\u03c9i(x\n2\ni + y\n2\ni ) = \u01ebyi\n\u2211\nxj . (13)\nWe have found that, for \u01eb > \u01ebc, where \u01ebc is some critical\nvalue, the system possesses four additional fixed points\n(two stable and two unstable).\nBecause \u03c9i = 2\u03c0fi, and using the empirical physiologi-\ncal values (table 1) for the fi\u2019s and ai\u2019s mentioned above,\nwe can use the inequalities \u03c95 <\u03c94 <\u03c93 <\u03c92 <\u03c91,\nand a21 = a\n2\n5 <a\n2\n2 = a\n2\n3 = a\n2\n4, in order to obtain an\nanalytic expression for \u01ebc. The resulting approxi-\nmate equations lead to the following relations for\n38008-p3\nJ. J.

(15)\nThe asymptotically stable equilibrium points are the new\nattractors of the dynamical system.\nUsing physiologically estimated values for the parame-\nters (table 1) in (15) we obtain that \u01ebc \u2248 0.468. This result\nis in agreement with the numerical simulations shown on\nfig. 3(a), where there is OD for \u01eb\u2248 0.47.\nWe have also modeled the dynamics of the five-oscillator\nsystem for the given parameter values using analogue elec-\ntronic circuits [26]. The result of fig. 3(b) shows the exper-\nimental observation of OD in good qualitative agreement\nwith both the theory and numerical simulations.\nWe have found that, just before the onset of death,\nthe 2-oscillator system (4) exhibits highly complex,\nquasiperiodic and chaotic, behavior. Figure 4(a) plots the\nx1-y1 phase diagram when \u01eb= 3.578\u2248 \u01ebc. For comparison\nthe circle in the background shows the limit cycle when\n\u01eb= 0, and the two full (green) spots signal the place where\nthe new fixed points will arise. The attractor\u2019s structure,\nthe seemingly random amplitudes of the time series, the\nlengthening of the period with a square-root scaling, and\nthe power-law\u2013like spectrum, indicate that the system\nenters a chaotic regime just before it dies.

In terms of the cardiovas-\ncular analogue this complex behavior might be seen as\na predictor of imminent death of the cardio-respiratory\ncoupled oscillations. Moreover, multimodal period distrib-\nutions are typical of the time variability observed in other\nbiological systems, e.g., the intermitotic time of human\nskeletal cells, and moments of change in the rotation\ndirection of flagella [22]. It is evident that, at least in this\nkind of coupled biological system, the variability of the\noscillations increases near the onset of global bifurcations.\nThus, OD in (1) can occur via both of the known routes.\nWhen \u01eb is negative and below a critical value, the origin\nbecomes asymptotically stable and the oscillations die\nat almost constant frequency, i.e., the Hopf bifurcation\nscenario. In the second mechanism, OD occurs when new\nfixed points appear on the former attractor after \u01eb has\nsurpassed a positive threshold: the amplitude remains\nalmost constant while the frequency decreases with a\nsquare-root scaling in a saddle-node bifurcation.\nWhen a system arrives in the OD regime it lies quies-\ncent. Although apparently trivial, this state results from\ndiverse complex interactions between the coupled elements\nthat form the system, as we show in this letter. Thus OD\ncan be seen as another kind of complex collective motion,\nmuch in the same way as synchronization arises in complex\ncoupled systems as a self-organized dynamics.\nIn order to complete the analysis of system (1) in\nthis context we investigate the relationship between\nsynchronization and OD by measuring the synchroniza-\ntion index [1], defined as: \u03b31,1 = \ncos\u03a81,1\u000b2+ \nsin\u03a81,1\u000b2,\nwhere \u03a81,1 is the relative phase difference between\nthe oscillators. This index measures quantitatively the\nstrength of 1 : 1 synchronization.\n38008-p4\nDiverse routes to oscillation death in a coupled-oscillator system\n3 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.60\n0.25\n0.5\n0.75\n1\n\u03b5\n\u03b31,1\nFig. 5: Synchronization index \u03b31,1 as a function of the coupling\nstrength \u01eb for the system (1).\nFigure 5 shows the calculated values of \u03b31,1 as a func-\ntion of \u01eb for the coupled system (1). Initially \u03b31,1 is very\nsmall for low values of \u01eb and it increases monotonically in a\nquasiexponential fashion as \u01eb is increased. However, when\n\u01eb reaches a value near 3.15, \u03b31,1 no longer grows monoton-\nically, but has alternating epochs of growth and decrease,\ncorresponding to topological changes in the structure of\nthe attractors of both oscillators that lead to complex\ntransitions in the 1:1 synchronization state. These results\nsuggest that the transient epochs of cardio-respiratory\nsynchronization seen (for higher synchronization ratios) in\nmany studies of resting humans, both awake [27\u201329] and\nasleep [30], may arise in part from changes in coupling,\nas well as from drifts in the natural frequencies and other\nparameters.\nFinally, in order to explore the robustness of our results\nin a more realistic framework, we performed simulations\nof system (1) including the presence of stochastic forces,\nsince they can lead to spurious detection of complex\nphenomena [31]. Our stochastic model is\nx\u02d9i =\u2212xiqi\u2212 yi\u03c9i+ \u01eb(x1+x2)+D\u03bex,\ny\u02d9i =\u2212yiqi+xi\u03c9i,\n(16)\nwhere \u03bex corresponds to white Gaussian noise with zero\nmean and variance D2.\nThe simulation of eq. (16) is shown in fig. 6. The\nparameters used in this noisy equation are the same as\nthose used for eq. (1), besides D= 1.0. In the top panel,\n\u01eb was piecewise increased through a range of positive\nvalues, and OD was observed to occur at a value very\nclose to the noiseless case, \u01eb= 3.57. Similarly in fig. 6\n(bottom) \u01eb was piecewise increased but now in the negative\ndirection. OD was still observed, at a value near that\nof the noiseless case, \u01eb=\u22121.8. Thus the noise term in\neq. (16) does not eliminate, or change the nature of, the\nbifurcations leading to the appearance of OD; however,\nit influences the asymptotic value of the fixed points to\nwhich the system evolves.\nIn our study of OD we have obtained analytic relations\npredicting the onset of OD in the CV model, both for two\nFig. 6: Temporal behavior of the noisy system (16) as \u01eb is varied\npiecewisely. Top: \u01eb increases positively and OD is observed near\n\u01eb= 3.57. Bottom: \u01eb decreases negatively and OD is observed\nnear \u01eb=\u008a1.8. In both cases noise intensity is D= 1.\nand five coupled oscillators, using assumptions provided\nby experimental physiological measurements. In addition,\nall the theoretical results have been verified in numerical\nsimulations. We have also observed partial OD [32] in our\nnumerical model, where some oscillators die while others\nremain active. It occurs if the eigenvalues corresponding\nto certain variables xi and yi have negative real parts,\nwhile those corresponding to other oscillator variables\ndo not have this property. For instance, this happens if\n2\u03b1ai+ \u01eb < 0. See fig. 2 (bottom).\nDiscussions of OD usually focus on the strength of the\ncoupling coefficient. The common phrase is that \u201cfor large\ncouplings, amplitude death will take place\u201d. However, now\nthat we have analytic expressions for the critical value,\nalso depending on other parameters, we can predict the\nonset of OD when different parameters are changed: OD is\nevidently a multiparameter-sensitive phenomenon. It can\nbe induced, not only by changes in couplings, but also\nby changes in the oscillator frequencies and amplitudes.\nFor instance, the analytic conditions for OD given by (6)\nindicate that, if the amplitude parameters a1 and a2\ndecrease (in fact it is sufficient to decrease the largest\none), then OD can occur for two coupled oscillators even\nwhen the coupling coefficient remains constant. The same\n38008-p5\nJ. J. Sua\u00b4rez-Vargas et al.\ncan happen if the excitability parameter \u03b1 is decreased\nbelow a critical value. Another interesting feature of OD\ninferred from (11) and (15) is that, if \u01eb > 0, and \u01eb > \u01ebc,\nnew asymptotically stable fixed points can appear. Thus\nthe oscillations die, but the dynamical variables can take\nnon-zero asymptotic values. We remark that the critical\nvalue \u01ebc depends on the oscillators\u2019 frequencies. That is,\neven for fixed coupling strength \u01eb, if the frequency of one\nof the oscillators falls below some critical value, then all\nthe coupled system can stop dead. This behavior is true\nboth for two or five coupled oscillators.\nWhat are the implications of these results for the CVS?\nGiven that (1) successfully models many features and\nstates of the CVS, we may speculate that phenomena\nanalogous to OD may also occur there. It would mean\nthat, for certain parameter combinations, the mutual\ninteractions between the cardiac, respiratory, myogenic,\nneurogenic and endothelial oscillators might serve to bring\none or all of them to a halt \u2014or at least to inhibit function.\nThe treatment to prevent or remedy such a scenario might\ninvolve the use of drugs to modify some of the parameters\n\u03b1, ai or \u03c9i so as to take the individual away from the\nregime of danger.\nThese results could also be applicable to coupled arrays\nof neurons in the brain. In the first demonstration of OD\nin a biological system Ozden et al. [9] coupled a man-made\ndevice to an array of real neurons and OD was provoked\nby taking the system into the strong-coupling regime.\nWe hypothesize that similar results could be obtained in\nresponse to frequency changes, according to rules similar\nto (6) or (11). The system would not then need to be in the\nstrong-coupling regime, which in some cases could damage\nsensitive biological tissues.\nIn summary, we have shown analytically and through\nsimulations that OD in the CVS model (1) can occur via\neither of the known bifurcation mechanisms. Furthermore,\nOD can be induced, not only by an increase in coupling\nstrength as conventionally accepted, but also by changes\nof, e.g., amplitude and\/or frequency. We have shown it\nto be sensitive to many different parameters. Connections\nbetween OD in the model, and phenomena in the CVS,\nappear possible but remain to be explored.\n\u2217 \u2217 \u2217\nThis research was supported by the EU through the\nAl\u03b2an programme No. E03D05224VE, the FP6 BRAC-\nCIA programme, the Engineering and Physical Sciences\nResearch Council (UK), the Royal Society of London, and\nthe Wellcome Trust.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Pikovsky A., Rosenblum M. and Kurths J., Synchro-\nnization: A Universal Concept in Nonlinear Sciences\n(Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK) 2001.\n[2] Bar-Eli K., Physica D, 14 (1985) 242.\n[3] Crowley M. and Epstein I., J.
