J., Dawson, D. A., Horsburgh, G. J., Bell, J. J., Fish, J. D. (2008). A method for genotype validation and primer assessment in heterozygote-deficient species, as demonstrated in the prosobranch mollusc Hydrobia ulvae. ?BMC Genetics, 9, (55), 1-9. IMPF: 02.35 Sponsorship: NERCIn studies where microsatellite markers are employed, it is essential that the primers designed will reliably and consistently amplify target loci. In populations conforming to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), screening for unreliable markers often relies on the identification of heterozygote deficiencies and subsequent departures from HWE. However, since many populations naturally deviate from HWE, such as many marine invertebrates, it can be difficult to distinguish heterozygote deficiencies resulting from unreliable markers from natural processes. Thus, studies of populations that are suspected to deviate from HWE naturally would benefit from a method to validate genotype data-sets and test the reliability of the designed primers. Levels of heterozygosity are reported for the prosobranch mollusc Hydrobia ulvae (Pennant) together with a method of genotype validation and primer assessment that utilises two primer sets for each locus. Microsatellite loci presented are the first described for the species Hydrobia ulvae; he five loci presented will be of value in further study of populations of H. ulvae. We have developed a novel method of testing primer reliability in naturally heterozygote deficient populations. After the design of an initial primer set, genotyping in 48 Hydrobia ulvae specimens using a single primer set (Primer set A) revealed heterozygote deficiency in six of the seven loci examined. Redesign of six of the primer pairs (Primer set B) re-genotyping of the successful individuals from Primer set A using Primer set B and comparison of genotypes between the two primer sets, enabled the identification of two loci (Hulv-06 and Hulv-07) that showed a high degree of discrepancy between primer sets A and B (0 per cent and only 25 per cent alleles matching, respectively), suggesting unreliability in these primers.

In populations conforming to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), screening for unreliable markers often relies on the identification of heterozygote deficiencies and subsequent departures from HWE. However, since many populations naturally deviate from HWE, such as many marine invertebrates, it can be difficult to distinguish heterozygote deficiencies resulting from unreliable markers from natural processes. Thus, studies of populations that are suspected to deviate from HWE naturally would benefit from a method to validate genotype data-sets and test the reliability of the designed primers. Levels of heterozygosity are reported for the prosobranch mollusc Hydrobia ulvae (Pennant) together with a method of genotype validation and primer assessment that utilises two primer sets for each locus. Microsatellite loci presented are the first described for the species Hydrobia ulvae; he five loci presented will be of value in further study of populations of H. ulvae. We have developed a novel method of testing primer reliability in naturally heterozygote deficient populations. After the design of an initial primer set, genotyping in 48 Hydrobia ulvae specimens using a single primer set (Primer set A) revealed heterozygote deficiency in six of the seven loci examined. Redesign of six of the primer pairs (Primer set B) re-genotyping of the successful individuals from Primer set A using Primer set B and comparison of genotypes between the two primer sets, enabled the identification of two loci (Hulv-06 and Hulv-07) that showed a high degree of discrepancy between primer sets A and B (0 per cent and only 25 per cent alleles matching, respectively), suggesting unreliability in these primers. The discrepancies included changes from heterozygotes to homozygotes or vice versa, and some individuals who also displayed new alleles of unexpected sizes.

Even after successful microsatellite isola-\ntion, primers developed for certain species suffer from\nmultiple banding patterns and random primer binding,\nleading to difficulties in obtaining reliable genotype data.\nThe presence of repeat regions in the genome, known as\nSINEs (short interspersed nuclear elements), repeat mic-\nrosatellite regions, and a general failure to amplify a spe-\ncific product, have often been cited as potential causes for\ninaccuracies in data sets, for example in nematodes [10],\nlepidopterans [8,9,11] and marine molluscs [12-14].\nIn many marine invertebrates the situation is further com-\nplicated by a deficiency in the number of heterozygotes\nobserved (relative to Hardy-Weinberg expectation) (see\nAdditional file 1), with both allozyme and microsatellite\nstudies documenting the phenomenon in many marine\nbivalve and gastropod populations [14-21]. While some\nof the species presented in Additional file 1 are hermaph-\nroditic, e.g. Physa acuta, and thus may be expected to show\nheterozygote deficiency (due to high potential for selfing\nwhich would increase homozygosity in the population),\nthere are many more examples (see Additional file 1)\nwhere species display separate sexes and would not neces-\nsarily be expected to display heterozygote deficiency.\nWith this in mind, one should consider the numerous fac-\ntors which can cause heterozygote deficiencies. These\ninclude poor primer design and optimisation, null alleles\n[22], genotyping errors (stuttering or large allele dropout\n[23]), mutation, inbreeding effects, SINEs, non-random\nmating and population admixture. However, despite\nextensive examination in some cases [17,24] the causes\nbehind these heterozygote deficiencies still remain\nunknown and, as a consequence, the ability to utilise tra-\nditional techniques for primer and population assess-\nments may be significantly compromised.\nIn \"model\" populations, which are expected to conform\nto HWE, testing for heterozygote deficiency in loci is com-\nmonly used as a means to assess designed primers and\ngenotype reliability. In such cases identification of an\nunreliable primer pair, or a locus affected by null alleles,\nis simply a matter of identifying heterozygote deficiency at\nthat locus. This task is becoming increasingly simple due\nto the wide array of tools available for population and\nlocus assessment (e.g. GENEPOP[25]; CERVUS[26]; MICRO-\nCHECKER, [27]). Once identified, the primer pair can then\nbe removed from further study. Difficulties can arise,\nhowever, when attempting to identify unreliable primers\nand null alleles in populations that naturally display het-\nerozygote deficiency (see Additional file 1). In these cases,\nthe use of traditional analysis and software are no longer\neffective, as they often assume that populations conform\nto HWE and display expected heterozygosity. Thus, iden-\ntifying unreliable primers by analysing departures from\nHWE is ineffective due to the fact that the population itself\nis naturally deficient. In these cases primer reliability is\nnormally assumed without additional investigation\nbeyond these standard tests (Additional file 1). As a result,\nunreliable primers may often remain undetected.\nIn this study microsatellite loci were isolated and exam-\nined for heterozygote deficiency in the prosobranch mol-\nlusc Hydrobia ulvae. A previous study by Haase [16] using\nallozyme markers suggests that H. ulvae populations are\nnaturally heterozygote deficient; therefore further testing\nwas conducted here to see if the same conclusions would\nbe supported by microsatellite genotyping data. A novel\ntechnique was then used to assess microsatellite marker\nreliability by designing two microsatellite marker primer\nsets to amplify the same loci. By altering the binding sites,\ndesigning additional primers (B-primers) to amplify the\nsame loci as the original primer set (A-primers), and com-\nparing genotypes between A and B, a method is presented\nto assess the reliability of Primer set_A. Additionally, the\nmethod can also be used to identify inaccuracies due to\nPCR amplification failure and erroneous genotype scor-\ning.\nHydrobia ulvae is a widespread and abundant member of\nthe benthic fauna of estuarine habitats. It is dioecious\nwith sexes being easily identified through dissection. On\nthe west coast of Wales this species has peaks of spawning\nactivity in spring and autumn and produces plank-\ntotrophic larvae that remain in the plankton for up to four\nweeks before settlement [28]. This period of development\naffords the potential for dispersal to new habitats and\nmixing with geographically separate populations. The\nspecies provides an interesting case for molecular analysis\nas the pelagic dispersal phase raises fascinating questions\non gene flow, differentiation, recruitment, and inbreed-\ning, but there remains the potential for self-recruitment of\nestuarine populations [29].\nThe objectives of this study were: (1) to isolate polymor-\nphic microsatellite loci for Hydrobia ulvae, (2) to conduct\nstandard tests for HWE, heterozygosity, linkage equilib-\nrium and sex linkage and (3) to assess the use of alterna-\ntive primer sets for the same loci as a tool to assess primer\nreliability.Page 2 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genetics 2008, 9:55 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2156\/9\/55Results\nMicrosatellite library preparation, Primer set_A design and \ntesting\nThe first step was to isolate polymorphic microsatellite\nloci for H. ulvae and test to see if the population examined\ndisplayed heterozygote deficiency. Samples were collected\nfrom a presumed single population of Hydrobia ulvae from\nan area of approximately 1.0 m2 in the Dyfi estuary, Wales\n(52\u00b0 31' 31.9\" N; 4\u00b0 2' 40.2\" W) using a 0.5 mm mesh\nsieve to remove individuals from the sediment. Specimens\nwere stored alive in sea water of 28 \u2030 at 14\u00b0C until\nrequired for DNA extraction.\nPrior to DNA extraction, Hydrobia ulvae individuals were\ndissected and checked for parasitic infection. Those that\nshowed signs of infection were removed from further\nstudy to avoid the possibility of isolating microsatellites\nfrom the parasites. Extraction of Hydrobia DNA and prep-\naration of an enriched library yielded 118 unique micros-\natellite sequences that were submitted to the EMBL\nNucleotide Sequence Database [30] [EMBL AM409397\u2013\nAM409514]. For details of DNA extraction and enriched\nlibrary development, see Methods. All the obtained\nsequences were confirmed to be unique using BLASTN\nversion 2.2.4 [31]. Forty-seven loci possessed sufficient\nflanking sequence for primer design (in terms of repeat\nlength, sequence length and base-pair composition of the\nflanking sequence). Primer pairs were designed for 17 loci\nusing PRIMER3 [32], labelled with a fluorescent dye, and\noptimised with respect to temperature (gradient range\n50\u201370\u00b0C) and MgCl2 concentration (1.5 mM, 2.0 mM\nand 2.5 mM). A short chain of nucleotides (GTTTCTT),\nknown as a pigtail, was also added to the 5' end of each\nreverse primer to reduce stutter bands during PCR ampli-\nfication [33].\nThe subsequent PCR and genotyping of 16 snails from the\nDyfi estuary (including the six individuals from which the\nlibrary was made) using 17 designed primers, resulted in\nnine primers failing to amplify a specific product, and one\nlocus, Hulv-10 (AM409406; Forward-TCGTACCAG-\nGAAAGGCCTCAG, Reverse-CCACGTCACTTTCGGT-\nGCTC) being monomorphic in all 16 individuals tested.\nFor each of the seven remaining polymorphic loci a fur-\nther 48 Hydrobia ulvae individuals were genotyped. The\nprimers designed for these seven loci are hereafter\ndescribed as Primer set_A (Additional file 2). The expected\nand observed heterozygosity of each locus (as amplified\nwith Primer set_A) was calculated and null allele fre-\nquency estimates obtained using CERVUS version 2.0\n[26], while deviations from HWE and linkage equilibrium\nwere examined using exact tests in GENEPOP (v3.4) [25].\nResults showed that the seven polymorphic loci (when\namplified using Primer set_A) were highly variable, with\nthe number of alleles ranging from 16 to 27 (Additional\nfile 2). Six of the loci were found to display a heterozygote\ndeficiency when compared with the expectation under\nHWE. The exception was locus Hulv-04_ A, which was in\nHardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Additional file 2). Two of\nthe loci (Hulv-06 and Hulv-07) showed very low levels of\nheterozygosity, suggesting possible unreliability in the\nprimers (Additional file 2). However, to justify the\nremoval of these loci and designed primers, further exam-\nination was required, as low heterozygosity is not neces-\nsarily a precursor for unreliable markers. Another notable\nresult was the amplification success shown by Hulv-01_A,\nHulv-06_A and Hulv-07_A primers. At these loci, amplifi-\ncation success was slightly lower than expected (83.3%,\n83.3% and 70.8% of individuals amplified, respectively).\nGiven that high levels of amplification failure can be used\nas an indicator of unreliable primers, the opportunity was\ntaken to explore the connection between amplification\nfailure and primer reliability by examining these loci\nusing the primer redesign technique described.\nAs well as heterozygote analysis, tests were conducted\nusing the software MICROCHECKER[27] to examine geno-\ntyping error, presence of null alleles, allele frequency esti-\nmates, allele stutter and allele dropout (in which smaller\nalleles are preferentially amplified over larger alleles [23]).\nInterestingly, all results were negative except for null alle-\nles, which the software highlighted could be a potential\nfactor in causing the heterozygote deficiency at all but one\nof the loci, Hulv-04. For this reason, and to ensure that\nalleles were not failing to amplify due to the PCR condi-\ntions, each locus was PCR-amplified twice using each\nprimer set (A & B). On both occasions the same genotypes\nwere observed. Alleles were resolved on an agarose gel and\nallele sizes were checked to see if they were consistent with\nthe size expected based on the sequence of the cloned\nallele. Examination of the gel showed no indication of\nlarge alleles (> 500 bp), suggesting that neither SINE\ninsertions, nor duplicate microsatellite regions, were\npresent in the products. Pedigrees were not available for\nchecking the inheritance of null alleles due to difficulties\nin cultivating the species in the laboratory.\nLoci were also examined for sex linkage by visually com-\nparing the genotypes of individuals of known sex (sexes\nassigned after dissection), and the results suggested no\nassociation between apparent homozygosity and sex in\nthe genotyped individuals. Similarly, all loci were checked\nfor linkage disequilibrium using GENEPOP v3.4 without\nBonferroni correction and no linkage disequilibrium was\nobserved.\nComparing genotype data from two sets of primers for \neach locus\nIn order to test genotype outputs and Primer set_A relia-\nbility, microsatellite primers were redesigned (PrimerPage 3 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genetics 2008, 9:55 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2156\/9\/55set_B) (Additional file 3) for six loci (Hulv-01, Hulv-03,\nHulv-04, Hulv-05, Hulv-06 & Hulv-07) to amplify the same\nloci as Primer set_A. \"B\" primers were not designed for\nHulv-02 due to difficulty in identifying new primer sites\n(due to the length and base-pair composition of the flank-\ning sequence), so this locus could not be verified. In all\nother cases, primers were designed at sites as distinct as\npossible from the original primer sites. In some cases,\nshort flanking regions hindered primer design and thus\nonly one of the primers in a pair could be significantly\nshifted. However, where possible the 3' end of the primer\nwas redesigned so that primer reliability could still be\nassessed. Single mismatches at or near the 3' end of the\nprimer are known to affect the efficiency of polymerase\nextension and oligonucleotide stability [34] and will have\na greater effect upon amplified products than mismatches\nelsewhere [35,36], thus where possible an alteration in\nthe 3' end of the primer sequence was attempted. The rel-\nevance of this restriction in the current study and to the\ntechnique as a whole is discussed later.\nRedesigned Primer set _B was optimised, amplified and\nvisualised in exactly the same way as Primer set_A, using\nonly the DNA templates from individuals which yielded\nsuccessful amplification in Primer set_A. Samples which\nfailed to amplify a product in Primer set_A were not exam-\nined using Primer set_B, as regardless of the output from\nPrimer set_B in these cases, no comparison could ever be\nmade. This was also done so that direct comparison of\nsuccessful amplifications could be made between the\nprimer sets. Alleles were scored independently on separate\nABI3730 gel loading runs for each primer set (A and B) to\nprevent any bias in the data.\nTo assess primer data, the presence and size of alleles from\nPrimer set_B were compared with those originally ampli-\nfied by Primer set_A. Allele sizes were expected to show a\nconsistent and predictable difference in size between the\nprimer sets within each locus, due to the difference in\nproduct size caused by the redesign and movement of\nprimers. To be classified as a successful match between\nprimers, both alleles in a heterozygote needed to be the\nsame for both primer sets. Likewise, in homozygotes the\nsingle alleles needed to display the same product after the\npredictable size difference was taken into account.\nResults indicate that when both primer sets (A and B)\nwere used in conjunction to amplify the six target loci,\nfour of these (Hulv-01, Hulv-03, Hulv-04, & Hulv-05)\nshowed more than 95% agreement (allele-allele) between\nthe alleles amplified by the two primer sets A and B (Addi-\ntional file 4), suggesting that these primers from Primer\nset_A had amplified the target loci correctly, and thus are\nreliable. However, when comparison was made between\nPrimer set_A and Primer set_B for the remaining two loci\n(Hulv-06 & Hulv-07), a high degree of discrepancy was\nobserved (0% & only 25% alleles matching, respectively)\n(Additional file 4). These discrepancies included a change\nfrom heterozygotes to homozygotes or vice versa, while\nsome samples also displayed new unexpected allele sizes.\nSamples which failed to amplify the same target loci in\neach primer set were examined to ensure that poor DNA\nwas not the underlying cause. No individuals consistently\nfailed to amplify and the individuals failing to amplify dif-\nfered between loci and thus poor DNA samples were not\nto blame for amplification failures.\nWhen these findings are coupled with the previously iden-\ntified decreased amplification success at these loci, it is\nclear that Hulv-06_A and Hulv-07_A primers are not suita-\nble for further use in population studies due to their unre-\nliability. Interestingly, despite the fact that Hulv-01_A was\npreviously shown to display similar levels of amplifica-\ntion failure as Hulv-06_A and Hulv-07_A, analysis using\nredesigned markers has highlighted that Hulv-01_A prim-\ners were in fact producing reliable genotype data. There-\nfore the redesign technique presented here demonstrates\nthat decreased amplification success does not necessary\nmean a marker is unreliable.\nDiscussion\nThis study has shown that in order to identify and confi-\ndently remove unreliable markers in heterozygote defi-\ncient populations, additional techniques are required\nbeyond those currently applied to microsatellite data. The\ncurrently used tests such as examination of HWE, hetero-\nzygosity, amplification failure, allele frequency distribu-\ntions and linkage equilibrium are not sufficient to identify\nreliability in primer sets. This may particularly be the case\nfor invertebrate species, many of which commonly dis-\nplay departures from HWE and heterozygote deficiencies\n[14,19]. The results show that the majority of the loci\nexamined (6\/7) displayed heterozygote deficiency (Addi-\ntional file 2) and H. ulvae therefore exhibits similar char-\nacteristics to many of the marine and freshwater\ninvertebrates (as detailed in Additional file 1). The tech-\nnique presented here has shown that after primer rede-\nsign, Hulv-06 and Hulv-07 cannot be reliably genotyped\ndue to the discrepancies between each primer set. There-\nfore it is concluded that these loci, along with designed\nprimers, should not be used in future studies. Similarly,\nthe technique has also provided increased confidence in\nthe remaining loci (Hulv-01, Hulv-03, Hulv-04 and Hulv-\n05), which all showed similar genotype outputs regardless\nof the primer set implemented. For this reason, the tech-\nnique described here presents a useful method for helping\nto assess the reliability of designed primers in heterozy-\ngote-deficient populations.Page 4 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genetics 2008, 9:55 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2156\/9\/55Previous published studies have suggested many causes\nfor heterozygote deficiency in invertebrates, including\nselection, inbreeding, mutation and null alleles, SINEs,\npoor primer design and amplification error [14,19]. How-\never, attempts to ascertain the exact source of the hetero-\nzygote deficiency have often had limited success [21,24],\nand while it is not the purpose of this study to identify the\nsource of the heterozygote deficiency, the technique and\nresults obtained can be used to shed light into the cause of\nthe heterozygosity in the species.\nThe first factor to consider is selection. While some micro-\nsatellite loci have been shown to be affected by selection\n[37,38], the majority are still considered to be selectively\nneutral [39]. This study took care not to incorporate tri-\nnucleotide repeats, which have been shown to occur in\ncoding regions of the genome and thus are more likely to\nbe subject to selection [40]. Therefore, while it cannot be\ncategorically ruled out, selection is not likely to be the\ncause of the observed deficiencies. Similarly, given what is\nknown about the life stages of the target organism,\ninbreeding seems unlikely. In species with limited disper-\nsal or direct development, it is simple to imagine inbreed-\ning as a dominant force [41,42], which can be detrimental\nto species fitness [43,44]. However, given that Hydrobia\nulvae has a dispersal phase of up to four weeks [28], a\ngood potential for mixing of progeny by tides and cur-\nrents, and the likelihood of widespread settlement of lar-\nvae within the estuary, it seems highly improbable that\ninbreeding is occurring. Another alternative potential\ncause is the Wahlund effect, which is a heterozygote defi-\nciency due to the accidental pooling of discrete sub-popu-\nlations. Indeed, by disregarding sub-structuring within\npopulations one would expect to see a common defi-\nciency across the majority of the loci as observed in this\nstudy [14,42]. However, it is unlikely that samples taken\nfrom a homogeneous area of less than 1 m2, as done here,\ncould contain many different sub-populations [16].\nNonetheless, in order to be certain, additional genotypic\nanalysis would be required on individuals from identified\ncohorts and known local spatial localities [41].\nPerhaps the most interesting factor to consider with regard\nto the technique presented here is the presence of null\nalleles and their potential effect upon levels of heterozy-\ngosity. Null alleles represent base-pair mutations in the\nprimer regions which cause primer binding to weaken\nand\/or fail, resulting in a failure to amplify certain alleles\n[45]. As a result, the presence of null alleles in data sets has\nbeen commonly suggested as a contributor to heterozy-\ngote deficiency [46,47] (Additional file 1). While micros-\natellite regions are often highly polymorphic due to a high\nrate of mutation through replication slippage and proof-\nreading events [48], the flanking regions surrounding mic-\nrosatellite repeat regions are generally considered to be\nmore conserved. However, given the very high levels of\npolymorphism shown in microsatellite loci examined for\nH. ulvae (Additional file 2), it is possible that the sequence\nflanking the repeat regions may also exhibit increased lev-\nels of mutation which would certainly reduce the effec-\ntiveness of primer binding and result in an abundance of\nnull alleles. Microsatellite loci in humans have been esti-\nmated to have mutation rates of about 10-4 [49]. However,\nmicrosatellite mutation is known to vary between differ-\nent taxa [50,51], and while little is known specifically\nabout the mutation rate in marine molluscs, several stud-\nies, including this current study, have shown high poly-\nmorphism in microsatellite loci in marine invertebrates\n[14,20,52], suggesting that mutation rates may be high.\nFor this reason further investigation in marine inverte-\nbrates is required (i.e. genetic sequencing) to determine\nwhether mutations in the flanking regions introduce\nerrors into genotype data and consequently influence lev-\nels of heterozygosity.\nDespite this, there are several reasons to suggest that\nmutation and null alleles are not the explanation for the\noverall heterozygote deficiency observed in Hydrobia\nulvae. First, given their nature one would typically expect\nnull alleles to occur at a minority of loci and not across the\nmajority of loci as seen in this study [14,19,39]. Secondly,\nresults from the double-primer technique show similar\nheterozygote deficiencies and null allele frequencies in\nboth primer sets A and B in all loci with the exception of\nHulv-06 and Hulv-07 (Additional file 4). If nulls were the\nexplanation for the heterozygote deficiency then we\nwould not expect both primer sets to be equally affected.\nMutation and null alleles do however, present one possi-\nble explanation for the poor match between primer sets\nfor Hulv-06 and Hulv-07, particularly as the predicted null\nallele frequencies at these loci were shown by the software\nMICROCHECKER to be much higher than for all the other\nloci examined (Additional file 4). Indeed, when coupled\nwith the low amplification rate of individuals shown by\nHulv-06_A and Hulv-07_A primers (83.3 and 70.8%,\nrespectively), there is evidence to suggest mutation in the\nflanking regions and null alleles. Alternatively, the mis-\nmatch between primer sets A and B for Hulv-06 and Hulv-\n07 could be due to similarity in the flanking regions of dif-\nferent loci. In the study by Meglecz et al. [8] on lepidop-\nterans (butterflies and moths), high flanking sequence\nsimilarity was observed at a number of loci, which led to\ndifficulties in designing effective primer sets. Likewise, in\na study on the marine gastropod Littorina saxatilis, anom-\nalous large alleles were identified that may signify the\npresence of flanking similarity in marine invertebrates\n[20]. While no evidence has been found in the present\nstudy for large alleles above 500 bp as described by\nSokolov et al. [20], it is entirely possible that flankingPage 5 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genetics 2008, 9:55 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2156\/9\/55region similarity could introduce errors into genotyped\ndata and thus disrupt the levels of heterozygosity\nobserved. However, while further investigation into the\nmatter is required, the fact that very little sequence simi-\nlarity was identified in this study suggests that it is not a\ndominant factor.\nWhile the precise nature of the overall heterozygote defi-\nciency still remains unclear, it is concluded that mutation\nand null alleles are the likely explanation for the unrelia-\nbility observed at two of the loci examined (Hulv-06 and\nHulv-07). Drawing definitive conclusions on the presence\nof null alleles, the cause of heterozygote deficiency and\nprimer reliability, has been limited in this study due to\nconstraints on primer redesign imposed by the restricted\nlength of flanking regions. However, when redesigning\nprimers, attempts were made to make B-primers as dis-\ntinct from A-primers as possible, particularly at the 3' end\nof the primer, as this region is known to affect product\namplification and polymerase extension [34,36,35].\nGiven that the occurrence of restricted flanking regions in\nmicrosatellite studies has not been commonly reported,\nand that information regarding the length of flanking\nregions in different species is scarce, it is difficult to esti-\nmate the likelihood of primer redesign complications in\nother species; nevertheless, it is believed that the tech-\nnique presented here provides an important contribution\nto the field, as it offers a practical alternative to merely\nassuming primer reliability in heterozygote-deficient pop-\nulations. Most importantly, this study has highlighted the\nneed for increased caution in assessing primer reliability\nusing only standard assessments, especially in popula-\ntions commonly exhibiting heterozygote deficiency and\ndeviations from HWE. Moreover, this study has illustrated\nthat additional testing of designed primers in heterozy-\ngote deficient populations can identify potentially unreli-\nable markers, amplification errors and genotyping\nfailures, which are commonly associated with microsatel-\nlite studies [12,39]. For these reasons, the methodology\npresented will be of potential interest\/application to\nfuture studies on invertebrate and non-invertebrate spe-\ncies alike. Indeed, the technique will be of value in all mic-\nrosatellite studies that seek increased confidence in\ngenotype assignments. While doubling expenditure on\nprimers may be seen as a disadvantage, the benefits make\nthe technique a sound investment when one considers the\nhigh cost of running unreliable primers in large-scale pop-\nulation analysis. The technique will also be of particular\nuse in studies where small primer sets are used due to dif-\nficulties in microsatellite isolation. In these cases, it is\nimperative that all primers consistently amplify a reliable\nproduct, given the low number being implemented. Sim-\nilarly, the genotype data validation provided by this tech-\nnique will also enable increased confidence in species\nwhere multiple banding patterns and anomalous large\nalleles are often noted [20].\nIn addition to the technique proposed, five novel Hydrobia\nulvae polymorphic loci (Hulv-01, Hulv-02, Hulv-03, Hulv-\n04 & Hulv-05) (Additional file 2) are presented for further\nuse in population studies. Given their level of polymor-\nphism, these microsatellites, and the primers described,\nwill provide valuable tools in the study of genetic mixing\nand population differentiation in Hydrobia ulvae.\nConclusion\nWhile it is clear that Hydrobia ulvae is characteristic of its\ntaxon with regard to heterozygosity levels, the methods\ndescribed here provide a useful tool for assessing geno-\ntype data and primer reliability in studies where increased\nconfidence in microsatellites is desired. While traditional\nexamination of HWE and heterozygote deficiency has\nbeen shown to be insufficient to identify unreliable prim-\ners in naturally deficient populations, the use of dual\nprimers provides a simple alternative to merely assuming\nreliability. In studies that have previously only used tradi-\ntional methods, or assumed primer reliability, the tech-\nnique may serve to identify unreliable primer pairs early\nin the study before the cost of genotyping multiple indi-\nviduals is incurred.\nTherefore, while it is clear that standard examinations and\nsoftware can serve to highlight many primer reliability\nissues in model populations, heterozygote deficient and\nother non-model populations require the additional vali-\ndation provided by designing a second primer set. In\norder for microsatellite primers to be used effectively in\npopulation studies and to justify the lengthy developmen-\ntal process, they need to be reliable and of sufficient\npower, a situation which is more likely when validation\nsteps are taken.\nMethods\nDNA isolation\nGenomic DNA was extracted for microsatellite library\ndevelopment and genotyping using a modified CTAB pro-\ncedure with proteinase K digestion and a chloroform-iso-\namylalcohol protocol [53].\nMicrosatellite library preparation\nAn enriched Hydrobia ulvae microsatellite library was pre-\npared using a method based on Armour et al. [54], with\nmodifications described by Gibbs et al. [55]. Six Hydrobia\nulvae individuals of unknown sex were pooled to obtain a\nsufficient amount of genomic DNA from which to prepare\nthe library. The pooled genomic DNA (2 \u03bcg) was digested\nusing MboI (Qbiogene, Cambridge, UK), and ligated to\ndouble-stranded Sau-L linkers [56]. Size-selected (200\u2013\n800 bp), digested genomic DNA fragments were then\ndenatured and hybridised against double-stranded dena-\ntured dinucleotide and tetranucleotide sequences that had\nbeen bound to nylon Hybond membrane (Amersham\nPharmaceuticals Ltd, Buckinghamshire, UK). The ArmourPage 6 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genetics 2008, 9:55 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2156\/9\/55[54]et al.  pre-enrichment PCR was not performed [as in\n[55]]. The dinucleotide sequences (AC.GT)n and (AG.CT)n\nwere obtained as DNA Alternating Copolymers (Amer-\nsham Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Buckinghamshire, UK) and\nthe tetranucleotide sequences (TTTC.GAAA)n,\n(GTAA.TTAC)n, (GATA.TATC)n, (CTAA.TTAG)n and\n(TAAA.TTTA)n were prepared using two rounds of PCR\namplification as in Armour et al. [54]. Once recovered, the\nmicrosatellite-enriched Hydrobia ulvae fragments were\nseparated from the Sau-L linkers by digestion with MboI.\nFragments were then ligated into BamHI\/BAP-dephos-\nphorylated pUC19 vector (Qbiogene) and transformed\ninto XL1-Blue competent cells (Stratagene). Transformant\ncolonies were grown overnight at 37\u00b0C on agar plates\ncontaining Luria Broth, Ampicillin, X-gal and IPTG,\nbound to a Hybond nylon filter and screened with [\u03b132P]-\ndCTP and\/or [\u03b132P]-dATP radiolabelled dinucleotide and\ntetranucleotide sequences as described above. In total,\n902 transformants were screened and 265 produced a\npositive autoradiograph signal (4 of 18 from the dinucle-\notide library and 261 of 884 from the tetranucleotide\nenriched library). Sequence data for 153 clones was\nobtained using an ABI 3730 capillary sequencer with\nBigDye chemistry (Applied Biosystems). All sequences\nwere checked for duplication using stand-alone BLAST\nsoftware (protocol available at [57] and MEGA v.3.1\nsequence alignment software [58]. Of the 153 sequences\nexamined, 118 were found to be unique.\nPCR and genotyping\nWhen genotyping individual Hydrobia ulvae, each PCR\nreaction contained approximately 5\u201310 ng of genomic\nDNA, 0.5 \u03bcM of each primer, 1.5\u20132 mM MgCl2 (Addi-\ntional file 2), 0.2 mM of each dNTP and 0.05 units of Taq\nDNA polymerase (Bioline, London, UK) in the manufac-\nturer's buffer [final concentration: 16 mM (NH4)2SO4, 67\nmM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8 at 25\u00b0C), 0.01% Tween-20]. PCR\namplification was performed using a thermal cycler (MJ\nResearch model PTC DNA engine) with the following pro-\ngram: one cycle of 3 min at 94\u00b0C, followed by: 35 cycles\nof 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing temperature (Additional file\n2) for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 45 s and a final extension cycle of 10\nmin at 72\u00b0C. PCR products were visualised on 2% agarose\ngel, pre-stained with ethidium bromide. Amplified prod-\nuct sizes were compared to the size expected based on the\ncloned allele sequence and checked for the presence of\nlarge alleles (> 500 bp), a potential by-product of SINE\ninsertions [8,9].\nA fraction of the fluorescently-labelled PCR product was\ndiluted to one part per thousand and loaded on an ABI\n3730 DNA Analyzer, along with ROX500 size marker\n(Applied Biosystems). Allele sizes were assigned using\nGENEMAPPER 3.7 software (Applied Biosystems).\nAuthors' contributions\nRJB collected and processed specimens for examination,\ncarried out the molecular genetics studies and drafted the\nmanuscript.
