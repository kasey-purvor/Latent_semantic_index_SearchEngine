Haug1\n1Institut fu\u00a8r Festko\u00a8rperphysik, Leibniz Universita\u00a8t Hannover, Appelstr. 2, 30167 Hannover, Germany\n2Department of Physics, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YB, United Kingdom\n(Dated: December 6, 2009)\nThe use of two truly two-dimensional gapless semiconductors, monolayer and bilayer graphene,\nas current-carrying components in field-effect transistors (FET) gives access to new types of na-\nnoelectronic devices. Here, we report on the development of graphene-based FETs containing two\ndecoupled graphene monolayers manufactured from a single one folded during the exfoliation process.\nThe transport characteristics of these newly-developed devices differ markedly from those manufac-\ntured from a single-crystal bilayer. By analyzing Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, we demonstrate\nthe possibility to independently control the carrier densities in both layers using top and bottom\ngates, despite there being only a nano-meter scale separation between them.\nPACS numbers: 73.23.-b, 81.07.-b, 73.43.-f\nThe development of the micromechanical cleavage\ntechnique for manufacturing ultra-thin graphitic films\nhas made it possible to produce FETs based upon\nmonolayer graphene and to study their electronic\nproperties1,2,3,4 indicating that graphene is a gapless\nsemiconductor with a peculiar Dirac-type spectrum\nof charge carriers. Using micromechanical exfoliation,\nmultilayers of graphene are also often produced. Two\nlayers of graphene prepared by exfoliation usually exhibit\ncrystalline ordering with a characteristic AB stacking5,6,\nlater referred to as single-crystal (SC) bilayer. This\nshould be contrasted to pairs\/stacks of individual\nmisoriented graphene flakes identified among some of\nthe peeled graphitic films using Raman spectroscopy7\nand in multilayers grown epitaxially on SiC8. While\nthe individual carrier density in such layers is usually\nbeyond experimental control, in this paper we report\non the realisation of two-layer graphene-based FETs\nwhere the density on the two monolayers can be varied\nseparately, despite them lying only a dozen Angstroms\napart.\nThe nanostructures presented in this letter were pre-\npared by peeling off pieces from natural bulk graphite9\nwith adhesive tape and placing them on a silicon wafer\ncovered with SiO2. Since, at the intermediate stage of\nthe utilized deposition process only some part of the\ngraphene flake touches the SiO2 surface, the flake flips\nover during the removal of the adhesive tape, thus pro-\nducing two misoriented graphene layers lying on top of\neach other and separated by occasional surface deposits\n(Fig. 1a sketches the top-view of such a structure).\nThen, this material is processed into Hall-bar samples\nusing plasma etching and contacted (to both layers) by\nevaporating chromium and gold electrodes (Fig. 1b).\nFigure 2a shows two optical images of such a sample be-\nfore and after plasma etching. A darker than other areas\ntop-left edge indicates the position of the fold. Scanning\nthe structure with an atomic force microscope (AFM)\nreveals a double step at the etched edges (Fig. 2c and\nd) with a first-step height of 1.1 nm. Although layers\nLayer 1\nLayer 2\nContacts\nSiO2\nSi\n(a) (b)\nFIG. 1: a) Top view of a pair of arbitrarily oriented graphene\nmonolayers (Layer 2, red and Layer 1, blue) in a two-layer\nstack. b) A two-layer stack on top of a Si\/SiO2 (grey\/light\ngrey) wafer, etched and contacted (yellow) for transport mea-\nsurements.\nof graphene should have a height of 0.34 nm, previous\nAFM measurements showed values up to 1 nm for single\nlayer graphene lying on a substrate1 attributed to a water\nlayer underneath graphene and\/or the rippling graphene\nsurface.\nFrom these data and also from the transport mea-\nsurements shown below we conclude that the first\nstep is due to a monolayer of graphene. The second\nstep has a height of 0.6 nm which is larger than\nthe thickness of one layer but less than the height\nof two AB stacked layers. This indicates that the\nsecond layer is also a single layer which is separated\nfurther from the first layer than in a conventional bilayer.\nTo distinguish the designed device from monolayers or\nSC bilayers we performed transport measurements on\nthe sample shown in Fig. 2, applying magnetic fields\nup to 13 T at temperatures down to 1.5 K. To re-\nduce the influence of contact resistance on the measure-\nments, a multi-terminal device has been used, and differ-\nent combinations of two and three point measurements\nwere performed at a broad range of back-gate voltage,\n\u221270 V< VBG < 70 V, applied between the substrate of\nn-Si and graphene. As usual, positive back-gate voltage\ninduces electrons, negative holes. Figure 2b shows the\nmeasured field effect on graphene resistivity demonstrat-\ning the operation of the device as an FET1.

The\nmeasured maximum resistivity, \u03c1max \u2248 3.3 k\u2126 at 1.5 K,\nis about half of the earlier-reported typical values for\nmonolayers2,4, which is in line with the assumption that\nthe device consists of two monolayers conducting in par-\nallel.\nMost importantly, the layer structure of ultrathin\ngraphitic films can be characterized by analyzing the\nShubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations in the flake resis-\ntance R(B) studied as a function of a magnetic field B\napplied perpendicular to the sample. The Berry\u2019s phase\npi characteristic of electrons in monolayer graphene is di-\nrectly related to the appearance of SdH oscillations min-\nima at filling factors \u03bdmin = 4(i+ 1\/2)\n2,3, in contrast to\nSC bilayer graphene6 where the electron\u2019s Berry\u2019s phase\nis 2pi and the SdH oscillations minima appear at filling\nfactors \u03bdmin = 4i, with \u03bd = nh\/eB being the filling fac-\ntor, n the carrier concentration, and i an integer. When\nstudied at a fixed back-gate voltage (e.g. VBG = \u221270 V\nand VBG = \u221240 V, Fig 3a,b), the magnetoresistance\nmeasured in the two-layer device and plotted versus 1\/B\ndisplays oscillations with two very different periods (com-\npared in detail in the top\/bottom panels of Fig. 3 a,b)\nmanifesting the co-existence of two very different car-\nrier densities, n1 and n2 in the sample. These two den-\nsity values can be obtained from the period \u2206B\u22121 of\nthe SdH oscillations, as n = 4e\/h\u2206B\u22121 (where we take\ninto account both the spin and valley degeneracy in the\ngraphene band structure). Their experimentally deter-\nmined gate-voltage dependence is shown in Fig. 3d. Sys-\ntematically repeated at all the studied voltage values,\nthe periodicity of both fast (lower panel) and slow (up-\nper panel) 1\/B-oscillations in the two-layer structure was\nsuch that the resistivity minima could only be attributed\nto the sequence of filling factors \u03bdmin = 4(i+1\/2), which\nis typical for monolayer graphene.\nn\nn h\/eB\n1\nR\n(k\n)\nW\nR\n(k\n)\nW\n4\n3\n3.6\n4.2\n3.0\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n3\n5\n0\n8 2416 4032 480\nV = -70V\nBG\n-50\n(c)\n500\nn\nn\n(1\n0\n\/c\nm\n)\n1\n2\n2\n3\n5\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4\nn h\/eB1 V (V)\nBG\n1\n2\n6\n1\/B (1\/T)\n8 2416 4032 480\n3.6\n3.0\n2.4\n40 62 128 1410\nn h\/eB\n2\n(a)\nn h\/eB\n1\nR\n(k\n)\nW\n4\n3\nV = -40V\nBG\n40 62 128 1410\nn h\/eB\n2\n(b)\n40 20128 2416 28\n(d)\nFIG. 3: a) Longitudinal resistance measured as a function of\na perpendicular magnetic field for VBG = \u221270 V.

A shift in the gate voltage of 11.5 V\ntakes into account doping of graphene by deposits.\nTo highlight this behavior of the presented data, in the\ntop\/bottom panels of Fig 3a,b the 1\/B intervals with the\nrising parts of the corresponding oscillations are colored\nin red\/blue. For comparison, Fig. 3c shows the results\nof a similar study performed for a SC bilayer, where the\nsequencing of the SdH oscillations minima coincides with\nthe earlier observed5 appearance of maxima at filling fac-\ntors \u03bdmin = 4i specific for such a material. Finally, the\nobserved carrier densities n1 and n2 in the two-layer de-\nvice and their dependence on back-gate voltage presented\nin Fig. 3d can be compared to theoretically calculated\nvalues plotted on the same figure as black lines. The\npresented calculation takes into account the electrostat-\nics of the device containing two monolayers at distance\nd \u2248 1.5 nm from each other lying on top of the SiO2\ndielectric layer (with permittivity \u000fb = 3.9 and thickness\nLBG), Fermi-energy dependence of the compressibility of\nthe electron gas with the Dirac spectrum E(p) = vp, and\nadditional doping charge, \u03b4n \u2248 2 \u00b7 1011 cm\u22122 due to de-\nposits left on top of the upper layer in the course of the\nmanufacturing process.\n3The parameters used in this calculation were obtained\nby fitting the observed VBG-dependence with the ana-\nlytical result relating the two densities on two parallel\ngraphene flakes,\n2\n\u221a\npid(e2\/\u000f0)[n2 + \u03b4n] = hv(s1\n\u221a\n|n1| \u2212 s2\n\u221a\n|n2|)\nn1 + n2 + \u03b4n =\n\u000f0\u000fbVBG\neLBG\nwhere the first equation states the equivalence of the\nelectro-chemical potentials on the two graphene layers\nwith si = ni\/|ni|, whereas the second relates the total\ncharge density in the device to its electrostatic capacity.\nTo tune the two carrier densities independently on\nthe two parallel layers, we fabricated a two-layer sample\nwith an additional top gate. A schematic view of the\nmanufactured device is shown in Fig. 4a, with the\ndesign resembling that of the top-gated SC bilayer\nstructures used recently10. To fabricate the top gate,\npolymethylmethacrylat (PMMA) was spun onto a Hall-\nbar device which was produced in a similar way as the\nsample shown in Fig. 2. The PMMA layer was partially\nexposed to an electron beam converting the PMMA into\na layer insoluble by acetone. Putting the sample in an\nacetone bath leaves an insulating PMMA layer of about\n60 nm on top of the graphene flake. A local top gate\nwith an area of 2.5 \u00b5m2 was fabricated on top of this\nPMMA layer using standard electron beam lithography.\nFigure 4b shows an image of the top-gated sample. The\nresistance measured in this device as a function of the\nback-gate voltage for a fixed top-gate voltage, VTG is\nshown in Fig. 4c (for VTG = 15 V). Its back-gate voltage\ndependence contains two pronounced peaks (marked by\narrows) indicating the difference between the carrier\nconcentrations in the top-gated and free parts of the\ndevice. The back-gate voltage interval between the\ntwo peaks corresponds to the bipolar transistor regime,\nwith a p-n-p junction11 formed underneath the top\ngate12,13. The tunability of the device using the top\ngate is demonstrated in Fig. 4d. Here, the back-gate\nvoltage was kept fixed at VBG = \u221240 V and the top-gate\nvoltage, VTG was varied. Due to the large negative\nback-gate voltage, the resistance maximum correspond-\ning to the \u2019neutrality point\u2019 in the top-gated region\nappears at positive voltage VTG = 26V (not shown in the\nfigure). To improve the visibility of the SdH oscillations\nand their evolution with VTG, we differentiate the\ndevice\u2019s resistance with respect to the magnetic field\nvalue and show the result using the blue-scale plot\nin Fig. 4d where one sees several sets of oscillations.\nThe oscillations which are almost independent of the\ntop-gate voltage originate from the areas outside the\ntop-gated region. The oscillations with a strong VTG\ndependence characterize the layers underneath the top\ngate. The deconvolution of these two contributions\nis achieved by the numerical subtraction of the VTG\nindependent part of the resistance. The resulting\nmagnetooscillations are shown in Figs. 4e,f as function\nR\nLayer 1\nLayer 2\nContacts\nSi\/SiO2\nTopgate\nR\n-40\n12\n8\n4\nR\n(k\n)\nW\n0.1 0.2 0.3\n1\/ (1\/T)B\n-40\n-20\n0\nGmax\n2\u00b5m\n-20 0 20 6040\nGmin\n(a)\nV (V)BG\nV\n(V\n)\nT\nG\n(b)\n(c) (d)\nn h\/eB2\nn h\/eB1 n h\/eB1\nn h\/eB2\n24 4832 5636160 8 24 4832 5636160 8 64\n24204 12 160 824204 12 160 8\n(e) (f)\n0\nFIG. 4: a) Schematic drawing of the second sample used in\nthe experiment.

This demonstrates\nnot only that the different carrier densities on the two\nclosely laid graphene layers can be detected, but also\nthat those densities can be independently controlled and\ntuned using a combination of top\/backgates.\n4In conclusion, we demonstrated the realization of a\ngraphene-based field-effect transistor containing two de-\ncoupled graphene monolayers at a nanometer distance\nfrom each other. Using the magnetotransport measure-\nments, we determine the carrier densities on the two par-\nallel layers and show the ability to control those densities\nseparately using a combination of electrostatic (back &\ntop) gates. When operated in a broad voltage range,\nsuch a device could be employed in a search for the re-\ncently predicted superfluidity14 in the \u2019excitonic insula-\ntor\u2019 state expected to form in a pair of graphene lay-\ners with opposite polarity. Also, the technique of layer\nfolding offers a promising method for making devices\nwith separately contacted pairs of monolayers acting as\natomically-thin optically-transparent15,16 electrodes to\nstudy vertical transport and electro-optical characteris-\ntics of nanoparticles of various materials that can be cap-\ntured between them.\nThe authors acknowledge financial support by the ex-\ncellence cluster QUEST within the German Excellence\nInitiative.
