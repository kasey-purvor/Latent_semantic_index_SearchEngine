John Kerry and\nthe Post-9011 World\u201d ~Bai 2004!. On the\ncover of the magazine was a serious-\nlooking photo of Senator Kerry, super-\nimposed with keywords such as\n\u201cTerrorism,\u201d \u201cIraq,\u201d \u201cAl Qaeda,\u201d \u201cMulti-\nlateralism,\u201d \u201cNuclear proliferation,\u201d and\nso on. While the article itself was in-\ntriguing, even more intriguing was the\nmagazine\u2019s attempt to capture Kerry\u2019s\ncore ideas on American national security\nwith the use of keyword graphics\u2014\nnamely, the keywords on the cover,\nplaced in what appeared to be a random\norder around the photo of Kerry, and the\nunderlining of \u201cJohn Kerry,\u201d \u201cterrorism,\u201d\nand \u201cAmericans\u201d in the inside title.\nCatchy graphics, but hardly an accurate\ndepiction of the keywords that might\nactually represent Kerry\u2019s thinking on\nAmerican national security.1 And, for all\nthe comparison made in the article itself\nwith President Bush\u2019s stance on national\nsecurity, where were the graphics for\nGeorge W.? ~They did not emerge in the\nnext New York Times Magazine.! The\nmagazine was, nonetheless, making an\nimportant point: that words ~and the\nideas they represent! are emotive\u2014\nparticularly in the highly charged climate\nof the 2004 presidential campaign. As\nmost commentators have concluded,\nideas mattered in this election, but as\nyet, we are unsure as to which ideas\nmattered and why. If political scientists\nare to take ideas seriously, then we\nshould explore more effective tools with\nwhich to measure ideas, and, ideally,\nsubject them to rigorous empirical analy-\nsis. However, no one yet has provided an\naccepted toolkit with which researchers\nmight be able to measure confidently and\nrepresent spatially ~certainly better than\nNew York Times Magazine graphics! the\nideas at play in the 2004 presidential\nelection.\nIn the months preceding the election,\none of the key issues was the War on\nTerrorism, and, in particular, Bush\u2019s abil-\nity to manage the crisis in Iraq. Many\ncommentators expressed the view that\nwar and global terrorism would be the\nkey defining factor in the election. They\nwere taken aback to find that 22% of\nexiting voters told pollsters that \u201cmoral\nvalues\u201d was the most important issue of\nthe campaign ~ignoring, incidentally, that\n78% ranked other issues more important,\nand that survey attitudes on abortion and\ngay marriage had remained unchanged\nfrom 2000! ~Anonymous 2004a; Elving\n2004!. One NPR pundit noted that:\nwe came down heavily on the Moral\nValues Story because it seemed to ex-\nplain how a nation dyspeptic about the\neconomy and the war in Iraq could vote\nfor an incumbent president responsible\nfor both. We latched onto the \u2018moral\nvalues\u2019 explanation because it came\nreadily to hand, and it was simpler than\nthe panoply of alternative explanations.\n~Elving 2004!\nThe Economist, in contrast, theorized\nthat \u201cmoral values\u201d might not be \u201cjust a\nmatter of social conservatism but also\ncode for trust in the candidate, or respect\nfor a man\u2019s willingness to take a stand\u2014\nwhere Mr Bush won easily. Mr Kerry\nnever quite managed to persuade voters\nof his leadership qualities\u201d ~Anonymous\n2004a!. And in a later analysis, The\nEconomist noted that Bush\u2019s \u201cmoral ma-\njority\u201d spread well beyond evangelicals\nto include mainstream Catholics and\nProtestants, thus forming a \u201ctraditional-\nist\u201d constituency who maintain \u201cthat the\npresident should have strong religious\nbeliefs\u201d ~Anonymous 2004b!.\nSo what was Bush\u2019s message? What\nwere the words or themes that seemed to\nappeal to the American electorate? And\nhow were these different from those used\nby Kerry? We are not short of speeches\nand statements ~not to mention, inde-\npendent analyses! of their respective\nmessages, but what we do lack is a sys-\ntematic and empirical textual analysis of\nthese. In this article, I use computer-\nassisted text analysis to measure statisti-\ncally and map spatially the key themes\nespoused by Bush and Kerry on the is-\nsues of national security and homeland\nsecurity. I use a unique software, called\nAlceste, which essentially integrates\ntext analysis with some statistical analy-\nsis. The result is an automatic ~that is,\ncomputer-generated! classification of the\nthematic classes from Bush\u2019s and Kerry\u2019s\nspeeches on national and homeland secu-\nrity. What is important to note, however,\nis that it is possible to begin the analysis\nwith no pre-set hypotheses about the ap-\nparent appeal of Bush\u2019s message; in this\nsense, the method is very different from\ntraditional programs that follow the in-\nstrumental approach but require the re-\nsearcher to specify the coding and\ncategories in advance. ~For an overview\nof these programs, see www.textanalysis.\ninfo.!2 Rather, we may begin with a sim-\nple notion that values mattered in the\ncontext of national security, but then ex-\nplore more precisely how they mattered.\nTo summarize in advance, the results of\nthe analysis suggest that the 2004 elec-\ntion pitted emotive appeal against logic,\nand in the end, emotive appeal appears\nto have won.\nCheryl Schonhardt-Bailey is senior\nlecturer in political science at the London\nSchool of Economics and Political Science.\nHer areas of research include: the interplay\nbetween interests, ideas, and institutions\n(and how they affect political behavior),\nlegislative politics, including roll call voting\nand textual analysis of legislative debates,\nnew methodologies for measuring ideas,\nand political economy (particularly relating\nto contemporary U.S. policy and 19th-\ncentury Britain).\nFEATURES\nPSOnline www.apsanet.org 701\nThe textual data consists of key\nspeeches by Bush and Kerry on the is-\nsues of national and homeland security,\nas listed in Table 1.3 These include\nBush\u2019s critical National Security Strat-\negy document of 2002 ~a collection of\nspeeches which encapsulates the Bush\nDoctrine! and his subsequent speeches\non national and homeland security in\n2004, along with Kerry\u2019s speeches on\nthese issues during the 2004 campaign.\nMethodology: Computer-\nAssisted Content Analysis\nComputer-Assisted Content Analysis\nin Political Science\nMany researchers in political science\nhave used classical content analysis\nto describe textual data.4 This form of\nanalysis provides a systematic and trans-\nparent way of managing large amounts\nof text. It also relies upon mainly\n\u201cnaturally occurring raw data\u201d\u2014e.g.,\nnewspapers, speeches, letters, public\ndocuments\u2014which avoids problems of\nreactivity of the respondent that may\noccur in interviews. And, finally, content\nanalysis provides researchers with well-\ndocumented procedures ~Bauer 2000,\n147!. But content analysis can also suffer\nfrom problems of sampling and coding.\nTable 1\nKey Bush and Kerry Speeches on National and Homeland Security\nDate Web Address\nBush\nNational Security Strategy of the United\nStates of America (compiled from\nspeeches on Sept. 14 & 20, 2001;\nMarch 14 & 22, 2002; May 23, 2002;\nand June 1, 2002)\nSept. 17, 2002 www.whitehouse.gov\/nsc\/nssall.html\nPresident Outlines Steps to Help Iraq\nAchieve Democracy and Freedom\n(Iraq Transition Speech)\nMay 24, 2004 www.whitehouse.gov\/news\/releases\/\n2004\/05\/20040524-10.html\nDefending American Lives and Liberty\n(Chapter 4 from \u201cA Plan for a Safer\nWorld and More Hopeful America\u201d)\nSept. 2, 2004 www.georgewbush.com\/Agenda\/\nChapter.aspx?ID=4\nPresident Speaks to the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly\nSept. 21, 2004 www.whitehouse.gov\/news\/releases\/\n2004\/09\/20040921-3.html\nPresident Bush Discusses Iraq Report Oct. 7, 2004 www.whitehouse.gov\/news\/releases\/\n2004\/10\/20041007-6.html\nHomeland Security President Bush Calls For Renewing the\nUSA PATRIOT Act\nApril 19, 2004 www.whitehouse.gov\/news\/releases\/\n2004\/04\/20040419-4.html\nPresident Bush: Information Sharing,\nPatriot Act Vital to Homeland Security\nApril 20, 2004 www.whitehouse.gov\/news\/releases\/\n2004\/04\/20040420-2.html\nPresident\u2019s Remarks on Homeland\nSecurity in New Jersey\nOct. 18, 2004 www.whitehouse.gov\/news\/releases\/\n2004\/10\/20041018-11.html\nKerry\nFighting a Comprehensive War on\nTerrorism\nFeb. 27, 2004 www.johnkerry.com\/pressroom\/speeches\/\nspc_2004_0227.html\nProtecting Our Military Families in Times\nof War\nMarch 17, 2004 www.johnkerry.com\/pressroom\/speeches\/\nspc_2004_0317.html\nThis Moment in Iraq is a Moment of\nTruth\nApril 30, 2004 www.johnkerry.com\/pressroom\/speeches\/\nspc_2004_0430.html\nSecurity & Strength for a New World May 27, 2004 www.johnkerry.com\/pressroom\/speeches\/\nspc_2004_0527.html\nNew Strategies to Meet New Threats June 1, 2004 www.johnkerry.com\/pressroom\/speeches\/\nspc_2004_0601.html\nStrengthening Our Military June 3, 2004 www.johnkerry.com\/pressroom\/speeches\/\nspc_2004_0603.html\nRemarks on Bush\u2019s Wrong Choices in\nIraq That Have Left Us Without the\nResources We Need at Home\nSept. 8, 2004 www.johnkerry.com\/pressroom\/speeches\/\nspc_2004_0908.html\n126th National Guard Association of the\nUnited States General Conference\nSept. 16, 2004 www.johnkerry.com\/pressroom\/speeches\/\nspc_2004_0916.html\nJohn Kerry\u2019s Speech at New York\nUniversity\nSept. 21, 2004 www.nytimes.com\/2004\/09\/21\/politics\/\ncampaign\/21TEXT-KERR.html\nSpeech at Temple University (linked to\n\u201cDefeating Global Terrorism\u201d Plan)\nSept. 24, 2004 www.johnkerry.com\/pressroom\/speeches\/\nspc_2004_0924.html\nA Fresh Start: Succeeding In Iraq And\nWinning Against Terrorism\nOct. 20, 2004 www.johnkerry.com\/pressroom\/speeches\/\nspc_2004_1020.html\nHomeland Security Supporting America\u2019s Front Lines of the\nWar on Terror\nMarch 15, 2004 www.johnkerry.com\/pressroom\/speeches\/\nspc_2004_0315.html\n702 PS October 2005\nThe former raises familiar issues of rep-\nresentativeness, sample size and the unit\nof sampling, while the latter involves\nissues of the nature of the categories, the\norganization of the coding scheme, and\nthe adequacy of the coding process and\ncoders ~136, 139!. In particular, interpre-\ntation of the material must be reliable\n~that is, coding must be consistent be-\ntween and among coders! and it must be\nvalid ~that is, the codes must relate to the\nwords used in the text and the sample\nmust represent the whole text! ~143\u201344!.\nComputer-assisted content analysis\u2014\nsuch as Alceste\u2014offers a way to\nsurmount the difficulties of traditional\ncontent analysis, while at the same time\nproducing results that are entirely consis-\ntent with it ~Allum 1998!. Alceste stands\nin stark contrast to classical content analy-\nsis in four ways. First, it is an automatic\nprocedure that is insensitive to meaning\nand context. This may result in missed\nnuances, but it also guards against re-\nsearchers and coders infusing their own\nbiases into the coding and analysis. Sec-\nond, it can provide an impression of a\nvoluminous data corpus within a very\nshort space of time. Third, and following\non from that, the issue of reliability\nwhich arises with human coding is no\nlonger relevant. Fourth, because large\namounts of text can be analyzed\nquickly\u2014which means that sampling\nmay not be required\u2014problems of sam-\npling may also disappear.5\nComputer-assisted analysis of political\ntexts has, moreover, recently captured the\nattention and imagination of some politi-\ncal scientists ~Gabel and Huber 2000;\nLaver and Garry 2000; Garson 2002;\nLaver and Benoit 2002; Laver, Benoit\net al. 2002!, and has received well-\ndeserved praise: \u201cThe ability to analyze\nvast amounts of text quickly and cheaply\nhas the potential to revolutionize the\nstudy of politics\u201d ~Laver, Benoit et al.\n2002, 3!.6\nAlceste\nAlceste relies upon co-occurrence\nanalysis, which is the statistical analysis\nof frequent word pairs in a text corpus.\nAlceste was developed by Max Reinert\n~1983; 1998! and was originally used in\nthe humanities ~1993!, although its use\nhas recently spread to the social sciences\n~Noel-Jorand, Reinert et al. 1995; Lahlou\n1996; Allum 1998; Lahlou 1998; Wagner\nand Kronberger forthcoming! and to po-\nlitical science ~Brugidou 1998; Brugidou\n2000; Bailey and Schonhardt-Bailey\n2005; Schonhardt-Bailey 2006!. It has\nbeen described as a \u201cmethodology\u201d inso-\nfar as it \u201cintegrates a multitude of highly\nsophisticated statistical methods into an\norganic whole that perfectly suits its aim\nof discourse analysis\u201d ~Kronberger and\nWagner 2000, 306!.7 More simply, it may\nbe described as a marriage of textual and\nstatistical analysis ~Popping 2004!.\nBecause Alceste is automatic ~that is,\nthe categories are generated by the pro-\ngram, not by the researcher!, it is differ-\nent from other qualitative software that\nsupports manual content analysis\u2014e.g.,\nAtlas.ti or Nudist ~Barry 1998!. Similar\nto TextQuest, Alceste facilitates quantita-\ntive analysis, following in the tradition of\nIker ~1974; Iker and Klein 1974!, and\nmore recently, Miller ~1997! and others\n~Hogenraad, Bestgen et al. 1995!. In\nshort, a variety of packages are on offer\nfor computer-assisted content analysis.\nWhile other programs are useful for\nsome purposes, Alceste is better suited\nfor an analysis of political speeches for\nthree reasons. First, following minimal\nediting, the text is ready for analysis.\nSecond, Alceste proposes classes ~or\nthemes! based on word lists and charac-\nteristic phrases. Both key words and sen-\ntences are, moreover, ranked in terms of\ntheir statistical significance ~of which\nmore is said below!, and both can be\ntraced back to the original text so that\nwe may evaluate their context. Third, the\ntechnique generates correspondence\nanalysis so that the speaker may be\nmapped onto the same policy space as\nthe identified classes or themes.8 The\nvalue of Alceste will be illustrated more\nclearly in the reporting of the results.\nThere are two preconditions for good\nresults with Alceste: ~1! the textual data\nmust be coherent ~that is, it must focus\non one topic!; and ~2! the text must be\nlarge enough for the statistical output to\nbe relevant ~with a minimum of 10,000\nwords!. The software is particularly\nadept at analyzing naturally occurring ~or\nnon-reactive! textual data ~Kronberger\n2004!. The speeches from Table 1 fit\nthese preconditions precisely: the\nspeeches all relate to national security,\nthe total word count is roughly 74,000\n~with Kerry\u2019s speeches contributing about\n3,000 more words than Bush\u2019s!, and the\ntextual data are non-reactive.\nAlceste determines word distribution\npatterns within a text, with the objective\nbeing to obtain a primary statistical clas-\nsification of simple statements ~or \u201ccon-\ntextual units\u201d!9 in order to reveal the\nmost characteristic words, which in turn\ncan be distinguished as word classes that\nrepresent different forms of discourse\nconcerning the topic of the text.10 Fol-\nlowing an iterative process, the descend-\ning hierarchical classification method\ndecomposes the classes until a predeter-\nmined number of iterations fails to result\nin further divisions. The result is a hier-\narchy of classes, which may be schema-\ntized as a tree diagram ~e.g., Figure 1,\ndiscussed below!.\nResults of Analysis of\nNational and Homeland\nSecurity Speeches\nIdentifying the Themes\nTable 2 provides a summary of the\nbasic statistics from Alceste. The total\nword count for the text file is 73,715 and\nof these, 34,883 are unique words that\nwere analyzed by the program.11 The\npassive variables12 ~also referred to as\ntagged indicators! are units of the text\nthat may be identified according to cer-\ntain characteristics, and here there were\njust two, \u201cBush\u201d and \u201cKerry.\u201d ~Others\ncould have been introduced\u2014e.g., the\ndate of the speech.!\nTable 2\nBasic Statistics for Key Bush and Kerry Speeches on National\nand Homeland Security\nTotal Word Count 73,715\nUnique Words Analyzed 34,883\nPassive Variables (Tagged Indicators) 2\nI.C.U.s (= number of cases) 2\nClassified E.C.U.s 1,253 (= 69% of the retained E.C.U.)\nLexical Classes 7\nDistribution of Classes (%) 1 Iraq War Critique\u2014Kerry (18.04%)\n2 Fellow Veterans\u2014Kerry (13.57%)\n3 Democratic Institutions, etc.\u2014Bush\n(20.75%)\n4 War on Terror\u2014Bush (13.97%)\n5 Homeland Security\u2014Kerry (12.37%)\n6 Nuclear Non-Proliferation\u2014Kerry (12.69%)\n7 Economic Growth in LDCs\u2014Bush (8.62%)\nPSOnline www.apsanet.org 703\nTable 3\nBush & Kerry Speeches on National & Homeland Security: Examples of Most Typical ECUs in\neach Class\nClass\nOriginal E.C.U.\n(traceable to the\noriginal text)\nChi square\nassociation\n(rank)\nSelection of E.C.U.s representative of each\nclass (where bold designates words that have\nbeen tagged with that class)\n1\nIraq War Critique (Kerry)\n1,510 51 (1) He should use more Iraqi contractors and workers,\ninstead of big corporations like Halliburton.

That\u2019s the\nwrong choice; that\u2019s the wrong direction; and that\u2019s\nthe wrong leadership for America.

They\u2019re trying to kill to\nshake our will; we\u2019re too tough, too strong, too resolute,\nand too determined to ever have our will shaken by\nthugs and terrorists [applause].\n4 752 39 (2) we face an enemy that is determined to kill the inno-\ncent and make our country into a battlefield.

The threats of terrorism and the conflicts of the\nfuture can only be met with more engineers, more mili-\ntary police, more psychological warfare personnel and\ncivil affairs teams more special operations forces and\nmore training for peace keeping missions.\n(continued)\n704 PS October 2005\nThe \u201cInitial Context Unit,\u201d or ICU, is\nessentially the sampling unit\u2014i.e., a pre-\nexisting division of the text specified by\nthe user. Here, each \u201ccase\u201d constitutes an\nICU and so, Table 2 notes that we con-\nsidered just two cases, namely Bush\u2019s\nspeeches and Kerry\u2019s speeches.13 The\n\u201cElementary Context Unit,\u201d or ECU, is a\n\u201cgauged sentence,\u201d which the program\nautomatically constructs based upon word\nlength and punctuation in the text.14\nUsing the presence or absence of words\nin each ECU, the program calculates ma-\ntrices on which to build the classification\nprocess.15 ~Table 3 provides examples of\nECUs.! The program conducts two pre-\nliminary analyses, each using slightly\ndifferent lengths for the contextual unit.16\nIt then opts for the length that success-\nfully classifies the greater proportion of\nECUs relative to the total available. From\nTable 2 we can see that 1,253 ECUs were\nclassified, equating to 69% of the ECUs\nretained for analysis.\nThe final two rows in Table 2 indicate\nthe number of classes identified and the\nsize of each class ~as measured by the\npercentage of the total ECUs classified\nwithin each!. In total, seven classes are\nidentified in Bush and Kerry\u2019s speeches.\nThe labels for each class ~e.g., Iraq War\nCritique, and so on! are not, however,\nautomatically given by the program. The\noutput provides the researcher with a\nnumber of different tools for conceptual-\nizing the content of classes. Of the many\ntools, two are particularly useful. The\nfirst is a list of the most characteristic\nfunction words for each class, along with\ntheir x2 statistical significance ~with the\nminimum x2 value for selection set at\n2.13, below which the level of statistical\nsignificance fails to reach the 10% level,\nusing the standard chi square table with\n1 degree of freedom!. The most charac-\nteristic words are those with high x2\nvalues. Words ending with \u201c\u0001\u201d indicate\nthat these are reduced forms ~e.g., presi-\ndent\u0001 may refer to president, presiden-\ntial, or presidents!. For Class 1, highly\nrepresentative words include Iraq\u0001,\nPresident\u0001, dollar\u0001, Bush\u0001, and wrong\n~with x2 values of 148, 115, 80, 69, and\n60, respectively!. For Class 2, they are\nthank\u0001, honor\u0001, famil\u0001, service\u0001,\nmen, and brothers ~with x2 values of 221,\n117, 97, 67, 65, and 64, respectively!. For\nClass 3, they are relation\u0001, human, in-\nterest\u0001, dignity, democracy\u0001, institut\u0001,\npeace, and principle\u0001 ~with x2 values of\n79, 71, 62, 59, 55, 49, 48, and 48, respec-\ntively!.

We will\ncontinue to press the multilateral development banks\nto focus on activities that increase economic\nproductivity, such as improvements in education,\nhealth, rule of law, and private sector development.\n7 159 64 (2) we will use our economic engagement with other\ncountries to underscore the benefits of policies that\ngenerate higher productivity and sustained economic\ngrowth, including: pro-growth legal and regulatory\npolicies to encourage business investment,\ninnovation, and entrepreneurial activity; tax policies\nparticularly lower marginal tax rates that improve\nincentives for work and investment;\nPSOnline www.apsanet.org 705\nand Korea\u0001 ~with x2 values of 361, 272,\n201, 112, 103, 90, 84, and 76, respec-\ntively!. Finally, for Class 7, they are de-\nvelop\u0001, growth, aid\u0001, financ\u0001, poor\u0001,\ncountries\u0001, and econom\u0001 ~with x2 val-\nues of 253, 193, 168, 155, 152, 150, and\n131, respectively!. While these word lists\nhelp the researcher identify the content of\nthe classes, their contextual meaning is\nnot obvious. For contextual meaning, we\nexamine the most representative ECUs\nfor each class in order to better identify\ntheir thematic content, which leads us to\nthe second tool.\nTable 3 provides examples of two of\nthe top four most representative ECUs\nfor each class, in which the context is\ngiven for the characteristic words, and\nwhere these characteristic words are\nindicated in bold.18 From both the word\nlists and the ECUs, we can arrive at con-\nceptual headings for the classes. For in-\nstance, in Table 3, the highest scoring\nECU from Class 1 is:\nHe should use more Iraqi contractors\nand workers, instead of big corporations\nlike Halliburton. He should stop paying\ncompanies under investigation for\nfraud or corruption. And he should fire\nthe civilians in the Pentagon responsi-\nble for mismanaging the reconstruction\neffort. Fourth, the President must take\nimmediate, urgent, essential steps to\nguarantee the promised elections can\nbe held next year.\nThis ECU and the remaining 20 top\nECUs for this class, together with its\nmost characteristic words ~Iraq\u0001, Presi-\ndent\u0001, dollar\u0001, Bush\u0001, and wrong!\nstrongly suggest that this class is a cri-\ntique of Bush\u2019s war in Iraq. Moreover, as\nthe program also provides the x2 statistic\nfor the most representative tag ~recall\nthat we have just two tags\u2014\u201cBush\u201d and\n\u201cKerry\u201d!, not surprisingly the Kerry tag\nis the only associated tag for this class,\nwith a x2 value of 162. ~Since the cut-\noff value is 2.13, this means that the\nBush tag scored below 2.13 for this\nclass, or failed to obtain significance at\nthe 10% level.!\nIn a similar fashion, we arrive at the-\nmatic headings for the remaining six\nclasses, along with their associated tag.\nClass 2 consists of Kerry\u2019s attempt to\nidentify himself with Fellow Veterans by\nmaking an emotive appeal to the families\nof servicemen and women for their sup-\nport. For instance, from the third ranking\nECU ~Table 3!, Kerry\u2019s appeal to service\npersonnel is clear:\nAnd to my fellow veterans, the band of\nbrothers who have been with me for so\nlong and to whom I owe so much, I\npledge that unlike the time when we\nfought side by side, I will be a president\nwho does what\u2019s right for our men and\nwomen in uniform.\nBush\u2019s appeal in Class 3 is quite dif-\nferent. Rather than invoking Kerry\u2019s\nimage of shared wartime experiences and\nsacrifice ~and thus encouraging an un-\nfavorable comparison with Kerry\u2019s mili-\ntary service!, he invoked the image of\nAmerica as defender and proponent of\nWestern, democratic values. Following\nthe arguments of Theodore Roosevelt,\nHarry Truman, and Ronald Reagan, for\nwhom American power and American\nideals were intertwined in foreign policy\n~Durham 2004!, he painted an image of\nAmerica\u2019s pursuit of \u201cfreedom,\u201d \u201cdemoc-\nracy,\u201d \u201cpolitical and economic liberty,\u201d\n\u201chuman dignity,\u201d and \u201cpeace\u201d in world\naffairs. I thus label this class Democratic\nInstitutions, Human Dignity, and Peace.\nClass 4 consists of Bush\u2019s definition\nand exposition of the War on Terror, as\nthe leading ECU clearly demonstrates:\nThere\u2019s nothing they can do to intimi-\ndate, to make us change our deepest\nbelief. They\u2019re trying to kill to shake\nour will; we\u2019re too tough, too strong,\ntoo resolute, and too determined to\never have our will shaken by thugs and\nterrorists [applause].\nThis class is essentially Bush\u2019s rallying\ncry for peace through strength, akin to\nRonald Reagan\u2019s appeal for a military\nbuild-up in the face of an \u201cevil empire\u201d\n~Reagan 1983! or Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s\ncharacterization of America as the \u201cgreat\narsenal of democracy\u201d ~Roosevelt 1940!.\nIn Class 5, Kerry presents his vision\nof Homeland Security, in which he high-\nlighted the need for more funding and\nmore personnel, as opposed to Bush\u2019s\n\u201cunder-funded\u201d provision. As illustrated\nin the top ranking ECU ~Table 3!, Kerry\nargued that:\nThe threats of terrorism and the conflicts\nof the future can only be met with more\nengineers, more military police, more\npsychological warfare personnel and\ncivil affairs teams more special opera-\ntions forces and more training for\npeace keeping missions.\nClass 6 proposes the distinct theme of\nNuclear Non-Proliferation. While Bush\ndid not ignore this topic, Kerry gave it\nfar more attention and clarity, proposing,\nfor example, \u201ca verifiable global ban on\nthe production of materials for nuclear\nweapons\u201d ~Table 3!.\nAnd finally, in Class 7, Bush linked\nU.S. national security to Economic\nGrowth in Less Developed Countries,\narguing that by contributing to improve-\nments in \u201ceducation, health, rule of\nlaw and private sector development\u201d\n~Table 3! the U.S. would boost prosper-\nity and spread the values of freedom and\ndemocracy in the rest of the world.\nOne might, at this point, ask what we\nhave gained from this analysis. The as-\ntute observer of the 2004 campaign may\nvery well have compiled ~from these\nsame speeches or other statements! a\nreasonably accurate list of thematic top-\nics associated with each candidate. Yet,\nour observer would have found the task\nof assigning quantities to the relative\nimportance of the classes and empiri-\ncally measuring their linkages far more\ndifficult. Turning to these linkages, the\nreal value of this analysis becomes\napparent.\nLinkages between the Themes\nIdentification of the word classes and\nthereby the themes enables us to describe\nBush and Kerry\u2019s discourse on national\nsecurity matters, but Figures 1 and 2\nhelp us understand the relative impor-\ntance of and the relationships between\nthose themes.\nTree Graph\nFigure 1 is a tree graph of the classes,\nschematized according to Alceste\u2019s de-\nscending hierarchical classification pro-\ncedure ~the percentage weight given to\neach class by the analysis is indicated in\nparentheses!. Beginning at the \u201ctrunk\u201d of\nthe tree ~from right to left\u2014that is, from\nleast related classes to most related\nclasses!, we see that the speeches con-\ntain two basic dimensions\u2014one is U.S.\nSpecific and the other focuses on issues\nrelating to the Global Order. This means\nthat U.S. national security ~as expressed\nby Bush and Kerry! splits into matters\npertaining specifically to the U.S., and\nmatters of order and security in the\nglobal arena. Perhaps not surprisingly,\nthe U.S. Specific dimension receives\ngreater attention with around 58% of the\ntotal classification, while the Global\nOrder dimension comprises 43%.\nFollowing the U.S. Specific path, we\nobserve two further clusters. Forces\/\nPersonnel consists of Kerry\u2019s dual cri-\ntiques of the Iraq War and Homeland\nSecurity, in which Kerry focused exten-\nsively on numbers of personnel and\nequipment given to each effort. A sec-\nond cluster is more emotive. Gratitude\nversus Fear highlights a clear difference\nin how the candidates appealed to the\nhearts and minds of the American elec-\ntorate. Kerry, on the one hand, invoked\nthe image of shared military experience\n706 PS October 2005\nand sacrifice ~Fellow Veterans! while\nBush painted the world as a fearful and\nevil place ~War on Terror!, but one in\nwhich terrorism can be overcome with\nAmerican strength and courage. Thus,\nwhen focusing on national security as it\npertains specifically to the U.S., Kerry\ntended to emphasize\u2014and criticize\u2014\npractical matters ~Forces\/Personnel!,\nover emotive concerns ~30% to 14%,\nrespectively!. This comes as no surprise\nas most observers were well aware of\nthe on-going difficulties in Iraq and in\nadministering Homeland Security ~e.g.,\nthe controversial PATRIOT Act!.\nMore surprising is the second, more\nemotive cluster related specifically to the\nU.S., where Kerry relied upon the appeal\nof shared military experience, bravery,\nand sacrifice while Bush invoked images\nof fear and courage. It is here that we\nsee distinctly the different means to the\nsame goal of winning the hearts and\nminds of Americans. In sum, Kerry ap-\npeared to dominate the public discourse\non the U.S. specific aspects of national\nsecurity ~particularly the management of\nforces and personnel19!, leaving Bush to\nfocus exclusively on the emotive theme\nof the War on Terror.\nTurning to the Global Order path, a\nlink can be seen between Bush\u2019s empha-\nsis on Democratic Institutions, Human\nDignity, and Peace, and his call for\nfurther Economic Growth and Develop-\nment in poor countries. Both of these\nthemes stress American liberal values\nand a free market economy as core to\nAmerican foreign policy, one of the\nplanks in the Bush Doctrine. Kerry\u2019s\ncall to Global Order\u2014i.e., his concern\nfor Nuclear Non-Proliferation\u2014is quite\ndifferent in contrast. While both candi-\ndates sought to provide Americans with\na rationale for international engagement\nin a post-9011 world, Bush embedded\nhis argument in the tradition of Ameri-\ncan \u201cexceptionalism,\u201d where \u201cpromoting\nliberal values abroad\u201d is \u201cseen as a\nprincipal U.S. value\u201d ~Lepgold and\nMcKeown 1995, 372!. Some describe\nthe Bush Doctrine as \u201cneo-conservative\u201d\nin which America is perceived as the\n\u201cbenevolent hegemon . . . fighting terror-\nism and seeking to extend democracy\u201d\n~Durham 2004, 265! while others main-\ntain that it follows in the tradition of the\nMonroe and Truman Doctrines, seeking\nto \u201cfoster a world environment where\nthe American system can survive and\nflourish\u201d ~quoting Paul Nitze\u2019s phrase\nfrom the famous NSC 68 memorandum\n~Donnelly 2003, 1!!. It might be argued\nmore simply that Bush seeks to create a\nvision of the international order that\nboth resonates with the American people\n~i.e., squares well with U.S. national\ninterests! and adheres to core liberal\n~and American! values. As Ruggie has\nnoted, visions of international order as\nespoused by American presidents should\nnot be dismissed as mere rhetoric, with\n\u201csophisticated leaders\u201d being \u201cforced to\nplay on @Americans\u2019# idealism to get\nanything done\u201d ~1997, 119!. Rather, the\ninterplay between ideas and interests is\nusually very complex. In capturing this\ninterplay between American ideas and\nAmerican interests, Bush won the \u201cvi-\nsionary prize.\u201d As the aforementioned\nNew York Times Magazine article\nnoted, \u201cKerry seemed to offer no grand\nthematic equivalent.\u201d Inasmuch as Ker-\nry\u2019s vision of a global order ~as cap-\ntured in his speeches! appears to have\nrested upon the more narrow ~but argu-\nably equally important! goal of nuclear\nnon-proliferation, it was both more lim-\nited in scope and had less emotive\npunch.\nCorrespondence Analysis\nThe results from Alceste\u2019s classifica-\ntion can also be represented graphically\nin correspondence space. The program\ncross-tabulates classes and words in their\nroot form in order to create a matrix\nwhich can then be subjected to factor\ncorrespondence analysis ~Greenacre\n1993!.20 In this way, we obtain a spatial\nrepresentation of the relations between\nthe classes, where distance reflects the\ndegree of association.21 Correspondence\nanalysis aims to account for a maximum\namount of association22 along the first\n~horizontal! axis. The second ~vertical!\naxis seeks to account for a maximum of\nthe remaining association, and so on.\nHence, the total association is divided\ninto components along principal axes.\nThe resulting map provides a means for\ntransforming numerical information into\npictorial form. It provides a framework\nfor the user to formulate her own inter-\npretations, rather than providing clear-cut\nconclusions.23\nFigure 2 presents a map of the corre-\nspondence analysis of the classes for\nBush and Kerry. ~When a large number\nof classes is identified, the program oc-\ncasionally fails to locate the center point\nfor the class with the fewest representa-\ntive words, which in this case is Class 7.\nHence, I have estimated the position of\nClass 7 from the correspondence analysis\nof the representative words, as illustrated\nin the Appendix, Figure 3.24! The two\ntags for \u201cBush\u201d and \u201cKerry\u201d are super-\nimposed into the same correspondence\nspace; and as stated above, distance be-\ntween the classes and tags reflects the\ndegree of association. To the side of the\nmap, we can see that the first two factors\ntogether account for just 52% of the total\nassociation, with the first factor account-\ning for about 28%. The relatively moder-\nate degree of association within a two-\ndimensional space, along with the large\nnumber of classes, suggests that Bush\nand Kerry\u2019s discourse on national secu-\nrity contains multiple cleavages.25 Never-\ntheless, two of these cleavages account\nfor over half the variation and therefore\nshould be considered prominent.\nFigure 2 illustrates a primary dimen-\nsion26 along the horizontal axis, namely\nthe same Global Order\u2013U.S. Specific\ncleavage that we saw in the tree diagram.\nThus, Kerry\u2019s dual critiques of Bush\u2019s\nfailings in Iraq and the administration\u2019s\nfailure to provide adequate Homeland\nSecurity ~Classes 1 and 5!, Kerry\u2019s call to\nfellow veterans ~Class 2!, and Bush\u2019s War\non Terrorism message ~Class 4! all fall\ninto the right-hand quadrants, while Ker-\nry\u2019s push for nuclear non-proliferation\n~Class 6! and Bush\u2019s dual themes of\nFigure 1\nTree Graph of the Classes for Bush and Kerry on\nNational and Homeland Security\nPSOnline www.apsanet.org 707\nspreading democratic institutions and\nfostering economic growth ~Classes 3 and\n7! fall into the left-hand quadrants. This\nis simply another way of observing that\nthe basic content of the seven classes\ndivided into those relating mostly to the\nU.S. and those concerned with maintain-\ning global order.\nAs we could have predicted from the\ntags associated with each of the classes,\nKerry is identified relatively more closely\nwith the U.S. specific issues while Bush\nis linked more with those relating to the\nglobal order. At first glance, this seems\nsomewhat counterintuitive. If Bush ap-\npeared to be relatively more concerned\nwith the global order and relatively less\nwith U.S. specific issues, then why did\nhe prevail among the American voters\n~and, for that matter, become the demon\nof electorates elsewhere in the world!?\nThis analysis does not, of course, gauge\nthe responses to the candidates\u2019 speeches,\nbut if we turn to the vertical axis, we can\nat least begin to appreciate Bush\u2019s appeal\nto ~some of ! the American electorate.\nThe vertical axis can be interpreted as\nseparating themes that were expressed in\nmore emotive terms ~in the top quad-\nrants! from those expressed using more\npractical language ~in the bottom quad-\nrants!. Classes 1, 5, and 6 all fall in the\nbottom quadrants. All three of these\nclasses were linked to Kerry and all had\nthe common thread of money ~billions of\ndollars wrongly spent in Iraq!, personnel\n~more specialists required for specific\nHomeland Security tasks!, and weaponry\n~securing nuclear weapons and equip-\nment!. In essence, John Kerry was\nproposing a new way to Manage the\nMilitary, one that he argued differed con-\nsiderably from that of the Bush adminis-\ntration. Bush did not significantly engage\nin this discourse and thus the lower two\nquadrants of the spatial diagram belong\nto Kerry alone. ~A simpler way to think\nof this is that Kerry trumped the Manag-\ning the Military verbal clash between the\ncandidates.!\nMeanwhile, Bush was fighting another\nbattle\u2014the battle for the Hearts and\nMinds of the American electorate. In the\nupper quadrants we find that the com-\nmon thread between Classes 2, 4, 3, and\n7 is an emotive appeal to shared values.\nIn Class 2, Kerry invoked his Vietnam\nwartime experience to capture the hearts\nof American veterans and their families,\npromising that, \u201cAs president, I will al-\nways remember that America\u2019s security\nbegins and ends with the soldier, sailor,\nairman and marine\u2014with every man and\nevery woman in our armed forces stand-\ning at a post somewhere in the world\u201d\nand that \u201cpatriotism isn\u2019t just about say-\ning you love your country, it\u2019s about liv-\ning it every single day.\u201d27 This was an\nappeal to American patriotism. In con-\ntrast, Bush tugged at American heart-\nstrings with a different emotive appeal,\nthat of American exceptionalism. As\nnoted above, by linking U.S. national\nsecurity with the spread of democratic\nvalues and economic growth, and by pit-\nting good against evil in the War on Ter-\nrorism, Bush\u2019s rhetoric evoked powerful\nand appealing images in the minds of the\nelectorate. While hindsight is a wonder-\nful thing, the simple conclusion of this\nfull-text analysis is that Kerry\u2019s emotive\nmessage struck a fairly shallow chord.\nA final observation from Figure 2 is\nthe position of the \u201cBush\u201d and \u201cKerry\u201d\ntags in the two-dimensional space. On\nthe horizontal axis, Kerry is positioned in\nthe U.S. Specific quadrants, while Bush\nfalls in the Global Order half. This re-\ninforces the finding that, with regard to\nnational security, Bush devoted relatively\ngreater attention to arguing the case for\nAmerica\u2019s role in the world arena. More\nstriking, however, is the vertical distance\nbetween the two tags, with Bush posi-\ntioned firmly at the end of the \u201cemotive\u201d\nhalf of the diagram and Kerry at the end\nof the \u201cpractical concerns\u201d half. It ap-\npears that Kerry fought and won the bat-\ntle of logic, but Bush fought and won the\nbattle of emotions.\nBy way of conclusion, it is useful to\ncompare the findings of this analysis with\nthat of Matt Bai in his New York Times\nMagazine article. Bai, who relied for his\nanalysis on an exclusive interview with\nJohn Kerry, quoted Kerry as espousing a\nsurprisingly benign worldview in which\nAmerica should seek to reduce terrorism\nto the point of being a \u201cnuisance,\u201d akin\nto \u201cprostitution,\u201d \u201cillegal gambling,\u201d and\n\u201corganized crime,\u201d where \u201cit isn\u2019t threat-\nening people\u2019s lives every day, and fun-\ndamentally, it\u2019s something that you\ncontinue to fight, but it\u2019s not threatening\nthe fabric of your life\u201d ~2004, 45!. Bai\ncharacterized Kerry\u2019s \u201cmultinational, law-\nenforcement-like approach\u201d to terrorism\nas \u201cdiscordant\u201d with a frightened Ameri-\ncan electorate, concluding that Kerry\u2019s\nFigure 2\nCorrespondence Analysis of Classes for Bush and Kerry\non National and Homeland Security\n708 PS October 2005\n\u201cless lofty vision might have seemed\nmore satisfying . . . in a world where the\ntwin towers still stood\u201d ~70!. So what has\ncomputer-assisted content analysis added\nto Bai\u2019s assessment?\nThis textual analysis of the well-\npublicized arguments of Bush and Kerry\non U.S. national security provides first,\nan objective, easy-to-use, and transparent\nmethod for measuring ideas in political\ntexts ~devoid of the researcher\u2019s subjec-\ntive bias, since the coding and classifica-\ntion are entirely program-generated!.\nThus, other researchers may replicate\nthese findings and0or challenge them by\nintroducing new textual data or by sub-\njecting them to other, similar software\nprograms.28 Second, this analysis pro-\nvides a way to measure ideas statistically\nand gauge their relationships spatially.\nThe use of the chi-squared statistic for\nboth representative words and phrases\n~ECUs! allows us not only to rank order\nthe keywords and key phrases by impor-\ntance, but also to gauge the intervals\nwithin these orderings. The tree diagram\nand correspondence analysis provide us a\nway to visualize the primary dimensions\n~global versus U.S. specific; emotive ver-\nsus practical! that divided the candidates\u2019\npositions on national security. In short,\nthis article has lent a specificity and\nclarity to the role of ideas in political\nspeeches, using a method that can be eas-\nily replicated and challenged by future\nresearchers. ~And, in response to my ini-\ntial criticism of New York Times Maga-\nzine graphics, in this article, the position\nof words in an illustration have substan-\ntive meaning.! And finally, the analysis\nprovides empirical support for the con-\ntention that the relevant battle in the 2004\npresidential election may well have been\none of emotions rather than logic, and it\nis here that Bush trumped Kerry.\nAPPENDIX\nFigure 3 provides a more detailed cor-\nrespondence graph of the representative\nwords in the analysis. This graph allows\nus to visualize the spread and overlap of\nthe representative words from the analy-\nsis. It is provided here for illustration\nonly.\nNotes\n*I am grateful for comments and suggestions\nfrom Andrew Bailey, Diane Maurice, David\nMayhew, and Frances Rosenbluth. I am also\ngrateful to the Georg Walter Leitner Program in\nInternational and Comparative Political Economy\n~Yale Center for International and Area Studies!\nfor funding that initiated this article, and to Mina\nMoshkeri ~LSE Design Unit! for her assistance\nin preparing the graphs.\n1. For interested readers, I have posted a\npicture of this cover on my web site:\nhttp:00personal.lse.ac.uk0schonhar0.\n2. I am grateful to Roel Popping for help-\ning to clarify some of the differences between\nAlceste and other text analysis programs. For\nmore detailed analysis of these other programs,\nsee Popping 2000. A detailed review ~Garson\n2003! of two somewhat similar programs, Text-\nGrab and TextQuest, uses as an example the en-\ntire web sites of two ideologically distinct U.S.\nSenators\u2014Jesse Helms and Hillary Clinton.\nThese packages allow verbal images to be por-\ntrayed in property space, but do not create the\nmore extensive spatial analysis available in Al-\nceste. See also, Garson 2002.\n3. Speeches were selected on the basis of\ntheir prominence on campaign or White House\nFigure 3\nCorrespondence Analysis of Classes for Bush and Kerry\non National and Homeland Security, Representative\nWords\nPSOnline www.apsanet.org 709\nweb sites. \u201cPlans\u201d were not selected because the\ntext was shorter and written in bullet-point fash-\nion, and thus its format differed substantially\nfrom speeches and thus would likely have dis-\ntorted the textual analysis. Also, no speeches by\nthe two vice presidential candidates were in-\ncluded. Finally, while the transcripts of the presi-\ndential debates were initially included in the\nanalysis, the rigid question and answer format\nwas significantly distinct from the prose of\nspeeches so as to create a distortion in the tex-\ntual analysis.\n4. Some examples include Jenkins-Smith,\nSt. Clair, and Woods 1991; Kahn 1992; Hill,\nHanna et al. 1997; Finkel and Geer 1998.\n5. Here, a text file of approximately 74,000\nwords is analysed by the program in about five\nminutes.\n6. Recent work by social psychologists has\nalso applied computer-assisted content analysis\nto address issues of political economy\u2014see\nOberlechner, Slunecko et al. 2004. Other appli-\ncations include business administration ~Kaban-\noff 1996; Kabanoff and Holt 1996! and market\nresearch ~McDonald 1982!.\n7. \u201cTaken together, the program realizes a\ncomplex descending hierarchical classification\ncombining elements of different statistical meth-\nods like segmentation ~Bertier and Bouroche\n1975!, hierarchical classification and dichotomi-\nzation based on reciprocal averaging or corre-\nspondence analysis ~Hayashi 1950; Benzecri\n1981; Greenacre 1993! and the theory of dy-\nnamic clouds ~Diday, Lemaire et al. 1982!\u201d\n~Kronberger and Wagner 2000, 306!.\n8. Further tags could be added to test vari-\nous hypotheses\u2014e.g., the timing of the speech,\nto evaluate changes in positions over time.\n9. For Alceste, \u201cstatements\u201d are defined as\n\u201ccontextual units.\u201d The program automatically\ndetermines contextual units with reference to\npunctuation and the length of the statement up to\na maximum of 250 characters. This description\nof Alceste follows Kronberger and Wagner 2000.\n10. Through its dictionary, Alceste prepares\nthe text by reducing different forms of the same\nword ~in the form of plurals, suffixes, etc.! to\nthe root form and transforms irregular verbs to\nthe indicative, thereby producing a matrix of\nreduced forms. It also subdivides the corpus\ninto \u201cfunction words\u201d ~articles, prepositions,\nconjunctions, pronouns, and auxiliary verbs! and\n\u201ccontent words\u201d ~nouns, verbs, adjectives, and\nadverbs!. The content words are understood to\ncarry the meaning of the discourse and the final\nanalysis is based on these. ~Content words are\nsometimes referred to as the \u201cmeaningful\nwords.\u201d! The program creates a data matrix ~an\n\u201cindicator matrix\u201d! which allows an analysis of\nstatistical similarities and dissimilarities of\nwords in order to identify repetitive language\npatterns. This matrix relates relevant words in\ncolumns and contextual units in rows, so that if\na given word is present, a 1 is entered in the\ncell; otherwise, the entry is 0. Then, using de-\nscending hierarchical classification analysis, the\nprogram identifies word classes. ~The term\n\u201cclass\u201d is used for descending hierarchical clas-\nsification analysis while the term \u201ccluster\u201d is\nused for the more traditional ascending cluster\nanalysis ~Kronberger and Wagner 2000, 308!.!\nThe first class comprises the total set of contex-\ntual units in the initial indicator matrix. The\nprogram then attempts to partition that class\ninto two further classes that contain different\nvocabulary and ideally do not contain any over-\nlapping words. The methods used for this are\noptimal scaling and the adoption of a maximum\nchi-squared criterion for cutting the ordered set\nof words. Alceste compares the distribution of\nwords in each of the two new classes with the\naverage distribution of words. Different forms\nof discourse that use different vocabulary will\nresult in an observed word distribution that de-\nviates systematically from one where the words\nare independent of each other. The procedure\nsearches for maximally separate patterns of co-\noccurrence between the word classes. The chi-\nsquared criterion is thus used as a measure of\nthe relationship that exists between words,\nrather than as a test.\n11. Plurals and conjugation endings are re-\nduced to a single form and nonce words are elim-\ninated from the analysis. The leaves a smaller\nword count which is analyzed by the program.\n12. These are deemed \u201cpassive\u201d as they do\nnot contribute to either the calculation of the\nword classes or the factors in the correspondence\nanalysis.\n13. Alternatively, each speech could have\nbeen considered as a separate case, but as the\ngoal of this analysis was to illustrate the method-\nology, the approach was kept as simple as\npossible.\n14. Popping notes that the ECU is akin to\nthe \u201crecording unit\u201d used in other programs,\nwhere it is usually defined by the researcher\n~Popping 2004!.\n15. A simple analogy is given to understand\nthe relationship between contextual units, ICUs,\nand ECUs: \u201ca contextual unit is to an ICU what\na paragraph is to a chapter, and to an ECU, what\na paragraph is to a sentence\u201d ~Reinert 1998, 11!.\n16. A contextual unit is equivalent to one or\nmore successive ECU~s!. The two calculations\nare done with two different parameters for the\nselected number of words per contextual unit in\norder to check the reliability of the classes and\nthe stability of the results ~Reinert 1998, 14!.\n17. The word \u201capplause\u201d refers to transcripts\nof speeches where the applause from the audi-\nence was recorded. For sake of transparency and\ncompleteness, the word was retained in the tex-\ntual analysis and\u2014for some research purposes\u2014\nmay serve a purpose. This was a distinct feature\nof some of Bush\u2019s speeches, while none of Ker-\nry\u2019s speeches recorded applause from the audi-\nence. This finding in itself may be noteworthy,\nbut is not explored further in this paper.\n18. The standard report lists the top 20\nECUs for each class, ranked by chi square asso-\nciation. However, a separate file is produced that\nlists all the ECUs for each class, where the de-\nfault cut-off for selection is zero.\n19. Notably, some of Bush\u2019s speeches from\n2002 predated Kerry\u2019s critiques of Iraq and\nHomeland Security, but nonetheless, Bush\u2019s\nspeeches from 2004 did not appear to offer much\nresponse to Kerry\u2019s attacks.\n20. While correspondence analysis is well-\nestablished in the French literature ~see Benzecri\n1973 and the journal Cahiers de l\u2019Analyse des\nDonnees! its use has spread with the publication\nof English applications ~Greenacre and Underhill\n1982; Greenacre 1984; Weller and Romney\n1990; Greenacre 1993!. Correspondence analysis\nhas only recently received attention by political\nscientists ~Blasius and Thiessen 2001!. Corre-\nspondence analysis using numerical data is avail-\nable in several major statistical packages,\nincluding BMDP, SPSS, and SAS.\n21. For this, correspondence analysis uses\nthe \u201cchi-squared distance,\u201d which resembles the\nEuclidean distance between points in physical\nspace. However, in correspondence analysis,\neach squared difference between coordinates is\ndivided by the corresponding element of the av-\nerage profile ~where the profile is a set of fre-\nquencies divided by their total!. The justification\nfor using the chi-squared concept is that it al-\nlows one to transform the frequencies by divid-\ning the square roots of the expected frequencies,\nthereby equalizing the variances. This can be\ncompared to factor analysis, where data on dif-\nferent scales are standardized. Greenacre pro-\nvides further geometric reasons for using the\nchi-squared distance in correspondence analysis\n~Greenacre 1993, 36!.\n22. Correspondence analysis usually refers to\nthe \u201cinertia\u201d of a table, which can also be called\n\u201cassociation\u201d ~Weller and Romney 1990!. A cor-\nresponding chi-squared value can be obtained by\nmultiplying the association value by the total n\nof the table.\n23. The association and chi-squared statistic\nmay be interpreted geometrically as the degree\nof dispersion of the set of rows and columns ~or,\nprofile points! around their average, where the\npoints are weighted.\n24. As with problems of degrees of freedom\nand multicollinearity in regression analysis, the\nway to resolve this difficulty is to obtain more\ninformation\u2014e.g., add more speeches. In this\ncase, however, more speeches ~of equivalent and\nsuitable nature! were not readily available.\n25. In total, five factors are identified in the\ncorrespondence analysis. Had the file size been\nlarger, the program would have more information\n~equivalent to degrees of freedom! with which to\nplot Class 7, thus creating six factors. ~Usually,\nthe dimensionality of the system is one less than\nthe number of classes in the profile ~Greenacre\n1993: 14!.!\n26. It should also be noted that the concept\nof dimensionality in textual analysis is distinct\nfrom that in the analysis of votes. For a discus-\nsion of the dimensionality of voting vis-\u00e0-vis the\ndimensionality of textual analysis, see\nSchonhardt-Bailey 2006.\n27. Quotes from the 6th and 7th ranked\nECUs from this class.\n28. See my web site ~http:00personal.lse.ac.\nuk0schonhar0! for the data for this article.\nReferences\nAllum, Nicholas C. 1998.
