A new adaptive trellis decoding \ntechnique for block codes is proposed. The \ntechnique is based on a recently introduced \nencoding technique which allows the design of \nalmost all known linear codes together with \ntheir minimal trellises. The proposed adaptive \ntrellis decoding technique allows t h e  \nimplementation of a single sof t  maximum \nlikelihood trellis decoder for decoding of \ndifferent codes. I t  has been shown that  both the  \nencoding and decoding techniques can be \nimplemented with a low complexity and cost. \n1. INTRODUCTION. \nTrellis decoding technique for linear block \ncodes has received sufficient attention for both \npractical and theoretical reasons [l-5). On the \npractical side, a minimal trellis structure of a \nblock code can be  used for performing low- \ncomplexity maximum likelihood soft  decision \ndecoding. From the  theoretical viewpoint, such \ntrellises can be used for constructing other \ncodes. In this paper we introduce a new simple \nencoding technique which allows the design of \nalmost all known linear block codes together \nwith their trellises. The trellises of the designed \ncodes a re  similar t o  the trellises of the coset \ncodes introduced by Forney [2]. However, the \nencoding procedure is simpler and allows the \ndesign of linear block codes with any arbitrary \ncode length. \n2. CODE DESIGN TECHNIQUE. \nThe technique is based on generalised array \ncodes (GACs) and their trellis structures [6]. A \ngeneralised (n,k,dmin) array code is an array \ncode in which the  column and row subcodes may \n0-7803-1820-Xl94 $4.00 0 1994 IEEE 682 \nhave different numbers of information and \nparity check symbols; the code length n=n1n2 \nand the  total  number of information digits, \nk= k l  + k2+ ..+ kn2, where n1 and n2 a re  the  \nnumber of columns and rows respectively, and \nkp is the number of information digits in the \npth row 161. GACs may be  considered as being \nformed from the union of coset(s) of a basis \nconventional array code, where the cosets are \nconstruct,ed such that  t he  union of cosets has \nthe same minimum distance as that  of the \nparent array code. Using the concept of the \nGAC, almost all known linear block codes \ntogether with their low complexity trellises can \nbe designed. The encoding procedure can be also \ndescribed. as an array representation of coset \ncodes introduced by Forney 121. To illustrate the \nproposed technique an example is given here for \nan (8,4,4) GAC which is equivalent t o  the well \nknown (&,4,4) Reed-Muller (RM) code. The \nprocedure for code design is given below: \n(i) Design the basic, (8,3,4), (n=4 x 2, nl=2, \nn2=4) array code, C1, with the single-parity \ncheck (4,3,2) column and repetition row codes \nR1=(2,1,2): \nP 4  p4 \nwhere xi, i=l,2,3, represent information digits \nand p-, j=Y, ... 4, represent parity check symbols. \n( i i )  Design an additional array code, C2, with \nthe  following structure: \nJ \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: IEEE Xplore.

Restrictions apply.\n0 x4 \n0 x 4  \nc, = \nwhere x4 is an additional information digit. \n(iii) \nmodulo-2 basis as follows: \nAdd the  two codes C1 and C2 on a \nP4 (X4@P4) \nThe designed code is a linear non-systematic \ncode and has the following parameters: \n(n0=8,k0=4,d0=4). I t  has been shown [71 that  by \ndeleting the symbol which is located in the \nsecond column and 4th row, the designed (8,4,4) \ncode will be  transformed to  the (7,4,3) \nHamming code. \nThe proposed technique has been \ninvestigated for the design of other known \ncodes, such as (15,5,7) BCH, (16,5,8) RM, \n(15,7,5) BCH, (17,9,5) optimum, (24,12,8) \nextended Golay, (23,12,7) Golay, etc. For \nexample, following the procedure outlined \nabove, one can design the (32,6,16) RM binary \ncode by choosing a (4 x 8) (nl=4, n2=8) basic \narray code, C1, with an (8,1,8) row code R I ,  \nand (4,3,2) single parity check column code. The \nfirst additional code, C2, should consist of a (4 \nx 5) all zero matrix and a (4 x 3) matrix of \nrepetition column codes. The (31,6,15) code can \nbe derived easily by deleting the parity check \nsymbol which is located in the 4th row and 8th \ncolumn. Figure 1 illustrates the trellis diagrams \nof a few examples of the above codes. I t  is \napparent from this Figure that  the proposed \ncode design technique provides codes with very \nlow-complexity trellis structures. \n3. NESTED TRELLIS DECODING. \nIn many practical applications, such as time- \nvarying communication channels, i t  is vital t o  \nhave an adaptive coding scheme in which \ndifferent elements of the overall coding format \nhave different level of resilience t o  noise and \ndistortion. The conventional adaptive block \ncoding techniques use a number of different \nencoders\/decoders each for different channel \nconditions. Although the error performance of \nsuch systems is improved, their complexity and \ncost a r e  increased dramatically. To reduce the \ncost of such a system i t  is vital to  have a single \nsoft  maximum likelihood trellis decoder \n(SMLTD) which could deal with different codes \nbeing used for information transmission; \nhowever, known encoding\/decoding techniques \ndo not posses such properties. \nIn this paper a novel nested sof t  maximum \nlikelihood trellis decoding (SMLTD) SMLTD \ntechnique is introduced [9]. The technique can \nbe employed for decoding a number of different \nblock codes in single decoder, and provides low \ncomplexity implementation in comparison with \nother techniques . \nA new adaptive trellis decoding technique \nfor product codes based on GACs has been \nintroduced recently [61. This adaptive coding \nand SMLTD scheme allows us t o  use one \nencoder\/decoder for different codes. This may \nbe done either by designing a set of codes that  \nhave equal number of s ta tes  and columns in \ntheir trellises and only differ in labelling of \ntrellis branches [7-91 or alternately by designing \na set of different codes with trellises which are  \nembedded into each other. The trellises of such \ncodes will be nested into each other and the \nprocedure for the design of such an adaptive \nencoder and its SMLTD is as follows. \n(i) Let  (n,k,d) be a block code with maximal \ncode length and information rate. \n(ii) Represent n=m x n2 where both m and n2 \na re  integers and define the size of array \n(m is number of columns). The following \ncondition \nd 2 n, ( 4 )  \nmust be satisfied in order to  design the \nbest code, where d is a minimum \nHamming distance of the code. \nDesign a basic (m x \"2, k,d) GAC [6]; \nThe trellis diagram of the  designed GAC \nwill have Ns=2{maxkp) number of s ta tes  \nand Nc=m+l number of columns, where \nkp is number of information digits in p-th \nrow, and each branch will be labelled \nwith n2 digits according t o  [6]. \n(iii) \n(iv) \n683 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: IEEE Xplore. Downloaded on December 3, 2008 at 11:15 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.\nDelete the parity check symbol located \nin mth row and n p d  column. A new code \nwill have the  following parameters (n- \nl,k,d-1) and a similar trellis. The only \ndifference between two trellises will be \nin the number of digits being used for \nlabelling branches a t  final depth of t he  \ntrellis. \nDelete the pth column in the  basic \nGAC. A new code will have the following \nparameters (n-nz,k-l,d'), where d ' r  9 - 1 .  \nThe trellis diagram for t he  new code will \nhave the same number of columns Nc, \nbut numb r of s ta tes  will be  reduced t o  \nNc=2 maxrkp-ll. The labelling of the \nbranches will require n2-1 digits and the \nnew trellis is a par t  of the basic trellis. \nDelete the parity check symbol located \nin mth row and n2-1 column. The new \ncode will have the following parameters \n(n-n2-l,k-l,d'-l) and a similar trellis. The \nonly difference between two trellises \nwill be in the number of digits being used \nfor labelling branches a t  final depth of \nthe trellis. \n(viii) Repeat steps (vi) and (vii) until only one \ninformation digit will be left (repetition \ncode). In this case Ns=2 and Nc=m+l. \nAn example of such a novel technique is \nshown in Fig.2. From this Figure i t  follows that  \ntrellises of different codes ((4,1,4) repetition \n[2], (4,3,2) single parity check [2], (7,4,3) \nHamming [7], (8,4,4) Reed-Muller [71, (1 5,5,7) \nBCH [91, (16,5,8) Reed-Muller [9], (31,6,15) BCH \n[9]) a r e  nested into the trellis diagram of the \n(32,6,16) Reed-Muller code [9], represented in \nthe form of GAC. This means, that  the \npresented trellis diagram can be used for so f t  \nmaximum likelihood decoding of any of the \nabove listed codes. The trellis diagram shown in \nFigure 2 can be  nested itself into a trellis of \nblock codes with higher block lengths or \ninformation rates. For example, all the  trellises \nshown in Figure 2 can be nested into the trellis \ndiagram of (32,20,8) block code which has the \nsame number of columns and 64 states. \nThe information throughput of t h e  system \ncan be optimised by an appropriate choice of \ncomponent codes. This can be achieved since \nthe size of nested trellis (number of s ta tes  and \ncolumns) depends on the component codes. \n4. CONCLUSION \nA novel low complexity adaptive nested SMLTD \ntechnique is introduced. The technique is \napplicable in all communication systems aiming \na t  providing low-complexity encoding and soft  \nmaximum likelihood trellis decoding of block \nbinary error control codes. The main benefit. \nwould be  lower complexity (and hence lower \ncost) and maximum likelihood performance, \nREFERENCES \n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n7. \n8. \n9. \nWolf J.K. \"Efficient maximum likelihood \ndecoding of linear block codes using a \nt re l l is\" .
