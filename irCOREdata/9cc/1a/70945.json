Numerical modelling of the cardiovascular system [7]\nhas shown that the role of noise in facilitating these phenomena can be crucial. Yet\nthe physiological origin of the oscillators is not yet fully established, nor the nature\nof the interactions between them, nor the origins or character of the the noise itself.\nThe nonlinear dynamics of an\u00e6sthesia therefore represents par excellence an unsolved\nproblem of noise.\nIt has become clear that the oscillatory processes \u2013 their amplitudes, frequencies and\nespecially their mutual couplings \u2013 can be used to characterise the state of the system.\nIt is known, for example, that that marked changes in cardio-respiratory synchronisation\noccur in an\u00e6sthesia [8]; furthermore, recent work by two of us [9] has shown that\ncerebral (cortical) oscillations interact with those of the cardiac and respiratory systems\nand that these interactions change in an\u00e6sthesia. Although the work is in its infancy,\nand is extremely challenging, there is a clear opportunity for applying techniques from\n553\nstochastic nonlinear dynamics, information theory and control theory to illuminate the\nunderlying physiological processes.\nApplication of the techniques of nonlinear science to rhythmic signals of biological\norigin [10] has already illuminated many fundamental processes, especially those con-\nnected with cardiac function. These include fractal dynamics [11], deterministic chaos\n[3] in heart rate variability (HRV) data and the fact (see above) that the blood circula-\ntory system behaves in many respects like a collection of five coupled oscillators [1]\nwith frequencies ranging from 1 Hz (cardiac) down to 0.01 Hz (endothelial\/metabolic\n[12]). Episodes of cardio-respiritory synchronization are known [4, 8] to occur in hu-\nmans; synchronization phenomena involving a 0.1 Hz blood flow component, believed\nto be of myogenic origin, can also occur [13, 14]. Pomfrett suggested [15] that HRV or\na bispectral index could be used to quantify depth of an\u00e6sthesia but that, in practice,\nit will probably be better to use several indicators rather than to rely on any particular\ntechnology; Larson and Galletly have commented [16] that the standard methods used\nfor HRV analysis are limited in their ability to detect the presence of cardioventilatory\ncoupling in heart rate time series, although there are some graphical methods [17, 18]\nthat seem promising. A different approach, based on synchronization indices and syn-\nchrograms, has recently been used to reveal an unexpected and very marked increase of\ncardio-respiratory synchronization during an\u00e6sthesia [8] in rats.\nAN\u00c6STHESIA\nIn an\u00e6sthesia a chemical perturbation of the organism leads to a temporary loss of\nconsciousness, but just how this happens remains to a large extent a mystery. Perhaps\non account of this lack of deep understanding, there are not yet any reliable markers for\ndepth of an\u00e6sthesia. Consequently, as Pomfrett [15] puts it \u2013\n\u201c...the an\u00e6sthetist is still unable to measure the depth of an\u00e6sthesia in order\nto prevent inadvertent awakening during an\u00e6sthesia.\u201d\nIt is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that the incidence of awareness among patients\nundergoing surgery is nonzero: see Table 1. Note that even the lowest estimate of 0.2%\nis unacceptably high. The problem can be particularly severe in cases where for clinical\nreasons the an\u00e6sthesia is kept as light as possible (e.g. C\u00e6sarian section), and where a\nmechanically ventilated curarised patient is unable to give any voluntary indication of\nawareness.\nA well advertised approach to assessment of depth of an\u00e6sthesia is the bispectral\nindex technique known as BIS [20]. Its use is controversial, however, and it is certainly\nnot 100% accurate [21, 19]. Other promising approaches involves measurements of\nchanges in heart rate variability (HRV) [15] and cardio-respiratory coupling [8, 17].\nWhat we propose in this project takes such ideas much further, partly by adopting a more\nsophisticated mathematical analysis of the data, and partly by including consideration of\nthe neural (cortical) oscillations.\n554\nTABLE 1.

Bottom: calculated\nfrom the same data using mutual information as proposed by Palu\u0161 et al [23]. The nearly horizontal thin\nlines are plotted\u00b12 standard deviations outside a set of surrogate data. If dr,c > 0 it means that respiration\ndrives cardiac function, and vice versa if dr,c < 0. In each case the directionality index exhibits a change\nof sign at a time that coincides approximately with the end of deep an\u00e6sthesia ([24]).\nAn\u00e6sthesia in rats\nThe first simultaneous studies of the neural and cardio-respiratory phenomena as-\nsociated with an\u00e6sthesia were carried out on rats, revealing a number of interesting\neffects. Rats exhibit similar cardiovascular dynamics to humans, except that the oscilla-\ntory components are 3\u20134 times faster [25], with heart beat at \u223c3 Hz and respiration at\n\u223c1 Hz. Analyses based on techniques drawn from nonlinear science [22] and informa-\ntion theory [23, 26] are being used to reveal and quantify causal relationships between\nthe cardiac, respiratory and neural oscillations, and how these change during an\u00e6sthesia.\nSeveral important results have emerged, and show that the more systematic study now\nproposed is likely to yield important results. As one example, we show in Fig. 1 how the\ncardio-respiratory directionality index evolves as deep an\u00e6sthesia gives way to lighter\nan\u00e6sthesia. There is a dramatic change of sign showing that, during the lighter an\u00e6sthe-\nsia, the heart is predominantly driving respiration rather than vice versa as is observed\nin the conscious state or in deep an\u00e6sthesia.\nComputation of the cardio-respiratory directionality index and how it evolves with\n555\n02\n4\n6\n \n\u03a8\n0\n0.5\n1\n \n\u03bb 1\n,3\n0\n0.5\n1\n \n\u03bb 1\n,4\n0\n0.5\n1\n \n\u03bb 1\n,5\n0\n0.5\n1\n \n\u03bb 1\n,6\n1\n1.2\n1.4\nHealthy subject 4\n \nf c H\nz\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n \nf r H\nz\n4\n5\n6\n \nf c\/ \nf r\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n \nc 1\n, \n \nc 2\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800\n\u22121\n0\n1\n \nd\ntime, s\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800\n0\n2\n4\n6\n \n\u03a8\n0\n0.5\n1\n \n\u03bb 1\n,7\n0\n0.5\n1\n \n\u03bb 1\n,8\n0\n0.5\n1\n \n\u03bb 1\n,9\n0\n0.5\n1\n \n\u03bb 1\n,1\n0\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\nAnaesthesia subject 6\n \nf c H\nz\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n \nf r H\nz\n10\n20\n30\n \nf c\/ \nf r\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n \nc 1\n, \n \nc 2\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800\n\u22121\n0\n1\nd\ntime, s\nFIGURE 2. Typical analysis of cardiorespiratory data from human volunteers in the wakeful state (left)\nand under an\u00e6sthesia (right). From the top in each case, the plots show as functions of time: cardiac fc and\nrespiratory fr frequencies and their ratio fr\/ fc; synchrogramme \u03a8; synchronization indices \u03bb1,n; coupling\ncoefficients c1 and c2; and directionality index d.\ntime from measured data could therefore provide one way of assessing depth of an\u00e6s-\nthesia. There are several others: from the original research [8] it appears that strength of\nsynchronization, synchronization index, and respiratory rate variability are good indica-\ntors; the latest results show that, in addition to the cardio-respiratory directionality index\n(Fig. 1), characteristic changes occur in the brain, especially \u03b4 and \u03b3 waves, and in the\ninteractions and causalities with the cardiac and respiratory oscillations.\nAn initial modelling of coupled oscillators within both the micro and macroscopic\nworlds and has been undertaken [27]. A large number of oscillators acting on a similar\ntime scale has been be represented as an ensemble that, on the macroscopic scale, may\nbe taken as a single oscillator. Furthermore, their interaction on the macroscopic scale\nwith other similar type of oscillators has been described, but acting on widely different\ntime scales.\nAn\u00e6sthesia in humans\nThe crucially important question of \u201cDoes what applies to rats also apply to humans?\u201d,\ni.e. whether an\u00e6sthetised humans display similar phenomena to those seen earlier in rats,\nis being addressed. The preliminary investigation [28] has involved studies of ten healthy\n556\nmen aged between 20 and 40 undergoing elective surgery. Standard clinical monitoring\nwas supplemented by forehead BIS Quatro electrodes (Aspect Medical Systems, Leiden)\nfor EEG capture and a TSD201 respiratory effort transducer (BIOPAC Systems Inc,\nGoleta, CA) for respiratory frequency (f). A standard an\u00e6sthetic (midazolam 2mg,\nfentanyl 1.5\u00b5gkg\u22121, sleep-dose propofol and isoflurane 1% in 40% oxygen in air) was\nadministered by the same an\u00e6sthetist. Recordings were made for 30 minutes in the\nan\u00e6sthetic room prior to surgery. Waveforms were digitised at 1000 Hz and stored on a\nPC for later analysis.\nA typical set of results is shown in Fig. 2 for healthy subjects in the waking (left) and\nan\u00e6sthetised (right) states. The synchrogramme \u03a8 plots points of fixed phase of the car-\ndiac oscillator as a function of the phase of the respiratory oscillator, and therefore yields\nn horizontal lines where there is 1:n synchronisation; the synchronisation index \u03bb1,n, cal-\nculated from the data, is equal to unity for perfect 1:n synchronisation, but is zero in its\nabsence; the coupling coefficients c1,c2 provide measures of the cardiac-to-respiratory\n(lower lines) and respiratory-to-cardiac (upper lines) couplings; and the directionality\nindex d specifies the direction of coupling, being +1 for exclusively respiratory-to-\ncardiac coupling, and \u22121 for the opposite extreme. In all cases the idealised behaviour\nis to some extent modified by noise. In the waking state, the synchrogramme reveals\ntwo brief episodes of 1:4 synchronisation starting at 0 and 650 s into the measurements.\nUnder an\u00e6sthesia, in marked contrast, there is a virtually continuous state of synchro-\nnization as shown by the horizontal lines in the synchrogramme and finite values of the\nsynchronization indices. As time evolves, the system passes through 1:10, 1:9, 1:8 and\n1:7 synchronized states \u2013 very similar to the behaviour seen earlier in rats [8]. The di-\nrectionality index d, calculated from the two unidirectional coupling coefficients c1,c2,\nshows that during deep an\u00e6sthesia, as in the waking state, respiration tends to drive the\ncardiac oscillator. In rats, d changes sign during emergence from an\u00e6sthesia (Fig. 1); it\nis not yet known what happens for humans.\nWe now plan to monitor patients throughout surgery and into recovery to explore how\nsynchronisation and directionality alter with changing depth of anaesthesia.\nCONCLUSION\nMany problems remain to be solved. In particular it will be necessary to develop al-\ngorithms for calculation of the directionality indices that are robust in the presence of\nphysiological noise. It is also highly desirable to reach an understanding of the under-\nlying processes giving rise to interactions between the oscillatory processes. If such\nproblems can be solved, the potential impact of the work is high, in both specific and\ngeneral terms. Specifically in relation to an\u00e6sthesia, we note that: an\u00e6sthesia is univer-\nsally employed throughout the world for all but the simplest surgery; awareness during\nan\u00e6sthesia is not as uncommon as it should be (Table 1) and, as already mentioned, a\nbetter way of measuring depth of an\u00e6sthesia would be widely welcomed. More gener-\nally, we note that: coupled oscillators are widespread in nature, at all levels; and causal\nrelationships between such oscillators are of great interest because they shed light on\nthe underlying mechanisms of coupling. Improved techniques for establishing causali-\nties based on measured noisy time series will be applicable in many areas.\n557\nREFERENCES\n1. A. Stefanovska, and M.
