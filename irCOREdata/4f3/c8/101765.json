Why, when capitalism still grows fat on the fruits of child labor, \nand squeezes its profits from the sweatshop, for example, are we concerning ourselves with frivolities such \nas art and aesthetics? In an age which is claimed to be characterized by an increasing aestheticization and \nwhere aesthetics are being heralded as prime arbiters of economic value and social worth (Featherstone \n1991, Postrel 2004) the questioning of this process is of the utmost importance to a range of business \ndisciplines. We started to open this debate with a fascinating and diverse track held in September 2004 in \nParis at the 2nd Art of Management Conference. The papers that appear in this special issue build upon \nand\/or were inspired by the conversations that began there. \n \nFrom the outset, we wish to make clear that we are certainly not denying that the birth of organizational \naesthetics in the early 1990\u2019s crystallized a growing and welcome recognition that processes of human \nsensemaking, organizing and managing at work are far more sensuous, embodied, passionate and \n\u201caesthetico-intuitive\u201d (Gagliardi 1996: 576) than traditional modernist organizational discourses had tried \nto make out, and these issues are undoubtedly (still) ripe for exploration. Indeed, to this end, we have \nseen several journal special issues (Consumption, Markets, Culture 5(1) 2002; Human Relations 55(7) \n2002; Organization 3(2) 1996;) monographs (Guillet de Monthoux 2004, Strati 1999), edited collections \n(Linstead and H\u00f6pfl 2000; Carr and Hancock 2003), conference streams and even a conference itself (Art \nof Management) \u2013 all of which have indisputably enriched our understanding of art, aesthetics and work. \nYet, within this hallelujah chorus, it is worryingly hard to make out the critical voice that started the whole \naesthetic movement in management and organization studies in the first place. Have things gone a bit too \nfar? Is aesthetics, this promised space of freedom, already co-opted? \n \nWhile there is much of analytic interest to be had from an aesthetic perspective on management and \norganization, the dark side of the notional field \u201cArt and Management\u201d is not insignificant. Theatre can be \nused as a mode of controlling organizational actors, art may be used as a way to mollify political demands, \nstyle used as an offensive weapon \u2013 in corporate life we can find a number of ways in which art and \naesthetic moves are used not to enhance organizational experience but to establish hegemony. The \nromantic notion of art as a panacea is of course a fallacy, but one we buy into far too easily. For instance, \nthe official art of Nazi Germany, Soviet socialist realism and the celebratory aesthetics of almost any \ndictatorship shows us how art can be used in an oppressive fashion. Still, the modern versions of this \u2013 \ncorporations sponsoring \u201csuitable\u201d art, the omnipresent portraits of great men in company boardrooms, \nart used as symbolic capital in company presentations \u2013 has strangely enough escaped our attention, for \nthe most part. Art, in our society, is still often seen as being objectively good \u2013 a dangerous conflation of \nethics and aesthetics (see Warren and Rehn 2006).   \n \nIn a world defined by consumption, the place of aesthetics and art is obviously a case of something far \nmore complex than mere decoration. Yet, in the economic sphere their place has continuously been \nstudied and discursively constructed as something positive and creative. Such uncritical acceptance \nclearly limits the potential of these issues to present a more complex and serious engagement with the \naestheticized world, and such a myopic view of art and aesthetics leaves a lot of things about organization, \nconsumption, markets and culture unsaid. Furthermore, what does this blind spot say about business and \nmanagement studies more broadly? For example, are we in danger of aestheticizing our own practices? \nMultimedia teaching experiences, brimful with animation, video, image and sound are becoming \nincreasingly commonplace in the design and delivery of higher education courses \u2013 the ubiquitous \nPowerPoint presentation enabling slick styling and televisual feasts. In research too, sensual research \nmethods that centre on the aesthetic dimension of research participants \u2013 such as photography and visual \nart (Taylor 2002; Warren 2002, 2006) are gaining increasing legitimacy and demanding attention from \nbusiness and management disciplines as diverse as economics, finance, marketing and human resource \nmanagement. Clearly there is a need to interrogate our own aesthetic practices to question why these \nshifts are occurring \u2013 what is actually being added here? Are we too guilty of celebrating style over \nsubstance? \n \nSo, in this exploratory vein, the papers in this volume inquire in various ways into the implications of a \ncelebratory perspective on the integration of the arts, aesthetics and management and, indeed, question \nthe critical too \u2013 critiquing the critique. We begin the issue just there, with a sharp reminder from \nJonathan Schroeder, who brings a marketing perspective to bear on these issues. Through a case study of \nwho may be the most commercially successful artist of all time \u2013 Thomas Kinkade, \u201cThe Painter of \nLightTM\u201d \u2013 he problematizes organization and management theorists\u2019 disregard for a reality that artists \nhave always been acutely aware of, namely the commercial potential of their work. He wryly observes that \nfor centuries artists have been producing saleable, profitable pieces that people will want to buy. In \ndrawing our attention to this fact, he suggests that the current colonization of the aesthetic domain by \nthose who control and manage organizations is probably a case of new wine in old bottles, and we should \nnot forget this in our analyses of them. In a similar vein, Timon Beyes and Chris Steyaert reflect on the \nnow well-established interest in organization and theatre, looking at and for justifications of theatre in \norganizational life. They note that this literature tends toward two clumps \u2013 those that celebrate theatre \nas an instrument to improve business performance and those that resist such claims, preferring a critical \nfocus on drama as a discourse of managerial control. In recognizing this, they suggest an alternative \nframing of the issue as \u201cpost-dramatic\u201d \u2013 theatre as \u201ccarnivalesque\u201d \u2013 in order to, as they put it, mess up \nthe matter of organizational theatre to better recognize its complexity. Having given ourselves a good \npinch lest we forget that the critical should not become the new mainstream, Alan Bradshaw, Pierre \nMcDonagh and David Marshall bring an empirical perspective to bear in the form of music. They present \ninterview data from musicians who speak of alienation from, but also connection to their art in a \ncommercial context, and how this seeming paradoxical state is balanced by the individuals involved in \norder to construct and understand their careers and artistic selves. Once again, we see that the dichotomy \nbetween the oppressed\/and the not-oppressed appears too simple. Staying with empirics, Nanette Monin \nand Janet Sayers discuss a remarkable development in the commoditization of aesthetic value: the \u2018Art \nBonus Points\u2019 system in New Zealand. If property developers spend 1% of their total construction costs on \nworks of art they receive 5% more space in which to erect their buildings. As this is normally in a vertical \ndirection, art is quite literally exchanged for air, and these bonus points are also tradable, a true aesthetic \neconomy! (cf. B\u00f6hme 2003). Whilst these paintings, sculptures and other objects are required to be \naccessible to the general public, as Monin and Sayers explain, the prestige and function of the buildings \nthey are displayed within create an environment which people do not feel comfortable in. Furthermore, \nthere is the consequence that only \u201cappropriate\u201d art is likely to be commissioned \u2013 in effect a double \nwhammy: the commercial oppression of art working in concert with art oppressing its audience. In their \narticle on the multiple receptions and repetition of the Bauhaus, Christian Volkmann and Christian de \nCock note another similar dynamic \u2013 how the continuous recasting of Bauhaus for specific ideological \nuses shows the dangers of turning the aesthetic \u201cusable\u201d. The consumption of the Bauhaus ideas and \nideals has in this analysis created a history of reception that has both made it infinitively more \u201cpopular\u201d \nand at the same time almost completely stripped away its original humanistic intent. This repression of a \nstyle can here stand as a case of art being oppressed by art, standing as an important reminder that the \naesthetic is in a state of constant play. \n \nContinuing on, by using a piece of art to analyze an example of excessive organizational opulence, Ann \nRippin shows us how Baudelaire\u2019s poem L\u2019Invitation au voyage highlighted, for her, how aesthetics can \nbe used to deny employees emotional catharsis over the effects of historical organizational action \u2013 in this \ncase, redundancies. In an exquisite piece, Rippin highlights a case where staff were unable to grieve over \ntheir treatment, their loss smothered by a gaily colored patchwork quilt of organizational kitsch \u2013 \noppression through beauty. This theme of beauty and order is taken up by Jaana Parviainen and Niina \nKoivunen in their unusual analysis of symmetry \u2013 an ancient aesthetic principle \u2013 and its effects on the \nrepresentation of organizational life. They argue that the symmetrical construction of organization charts \nand diagrams presents a well ordered and neatly regulated picture of business activity which, once again, \ntries to hide the reality that all may not be so controllable, controlled or controlling in organizational life. \nFinally, we end with a tale of the aesthetics of space from Jan Betts. Her focus on the boardroom as an \naesthetic space of organizational oppression reiterates many of the themes that have been explored here \u2013 \naesthetics act as a tool for political order before they are agents of beautification and bringers of joy. The \nfeel of a place, the emotions stirred in us by certain arrangements of activities and things at work, the \nvalues and ideals signified by the design, display and consumption of art and art objects in an \norganizational setting shape our behaviors through subtle and interpretive matrices that do not stand \napart from ethics, morality, power, ideology or any other variant of micro-political organizational life. \nThis, in the parlance of modern management, can stand as our \u201ctake home point\u201d. \n \nOne final point. In a quasi-ironic attempt to help our contributors feel some sense of their subject matter \nwe have deliberately oppressed their art \u2013 requiring them to express their arguments in only a (relatively!) \nfew words, curtailing their own aesthetic expression in the process and getting them out of their textual \ncomfort zone. For what is editing but oppression anyway? \n"}
