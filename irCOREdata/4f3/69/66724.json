INTRODUCTION\nA. Traffic Congestion and the Need for Traffic Control\nTransportation has always been a crucial aspect of\nhuman civilization, but it is only in the second half of\nthe last century that the phenomenon of traffic congestion\nhas become predominant due to the rapid increase in the\nnumber of vehicles and in the transportation demand in\nvirtually all transportation modes. Traffic congestion ap-\npears when too many vehicles attempt to use a common\ntransportation infrastructure with limited capacity. In the\nbest case, traffic congestion leads to queueing phenomena\n(and corresponding delays) while the infrastructure capacity\n(\u201cthe server\u201d) is fully utilized. In the worst (and far more\ntypical) case, traffic congestion leads to a degraded use\nof the available infrastructure (reduced throughput), thus\ncontributing to an accelerated congestion increase, which\nleads to further infrastructure degradation, and so forth.\nTraffic congestion results in excess delays, reduced safety,\nand increased environmental pollution. The following\nManuscript received December 6, 2002; revised July 18, 2003.\nThe authors are with the Technical University of Crete, Dynamic\nSystems and Simulation Laboratory, GR-73100 Chania, Greece (e-mail:\nmarkos@dssl.tuc.gr).\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109\/JPROC.2003.819610\nimpressive statement is included in the European Commis-\nsion\u2019s \u201cWhite Paper\u2014European Transport Policy for 2010\u201d:\n\u201cBecause of congestion, there is a serious risk that Europe\nwill lose economic competitiveness. The most recent study\non the subject showed that the external costs of road traffic\ncongestion alone amount to 0.5% of Community GDP.\nTraffic forecasts for the next 10 years show that if nothing is\ndone, road congestion will increase significantly by 2010.\nThe costs attributable to congestion will also increase by\n142% to reach 80 billion a year, which is approximately\n1% of Community GDP.\u201d\nThe emergence of traffic (i.e., many interacting vehicles\nusing a common infrastructure) and subsequently traffic\ncongestion (whereby demand temporarily exceeds the\ninfrastructure capacity) have opened new innovation needs\nin the transportation area. The energy crisis in the 1970s,\nthe increased importance of environmental concerns, and\nthe limited economic and physical resources are among the\nmost important reasons why a brute force approach (i.e.,\nthe continuous expansion of the available transportation\ninfrastructure) cannot continue to be the only answer to the\never increasing transportation and mobility needs of modern\nsocieties. The efficient, safe, and less polluting transporta-\ntion of persons and goods calls for an optimal utilization\nof the available infrastructure via suitable application of a\nvariety of traffic control measures. This trend is enabled by\nthe rapid developments in the areas of communications and\ncomputing (telematics), but it is quite evident that the effi-\nciency of traffic control directly depends on the efficiency\nand relevance of the employed control methodologies. This\npaper provides an overview of advanced traffic control\nstrategies for three particular areas: urban road networks,\nfreeway networks, and route guidance and information\nsystems.\nB. The Control Loop\nFig. 1 illustrates the basic elements of a control loop. The\ntraffic flow behavior in the (road or freeway or mixed) traffic\nnetwork depends on some external quantities that are classi-\nfied into two groups.\n0018-9219\/03$17.00 \u00a9 2003 IEEE\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 91, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2003 2043\nFig. 1. The control loop.\n\u2022 Control inputs that are directly related to corre-\nsponding control devices (actuators), such as traffic\nlights, variable message signs, etc.; the control in-\nputs may be selected from an admissible control re-\ngion subject to technical, physical, and operational\nconstraints.\n\u2022 Disturbances, whose values cannot be manip-\nulated, but may possibly be measurable (e.g., de-\nmand) or detectable (e.g., incident) or predictable\nover a future time horizon.\nThe network\u2019s output or performance is measured via suit-\nable indices, such as the total time spent by all vehicles in the\nnetwork over a time horizon. The task of the surveillance is\nto enhance and to extend the information provided by suit-\nable sensors (e.g., inductive loop detectors) as required by\nthe subsequent control strategy and the human operators. The\nkernel of the control loop is the control strategy, whose task\nis to specify in real time the control inputs, based on avail-\nable measurements\/estimations\/predictions, so as to achieve\nthe prespecified goals (e.g., minimization of total time spent)\ndespite the influence of various disturbances. If this task is\nundertaken by a human operator, we have a manual control\nsystem. In an automatic control system, this task is under-\ntaken by an algorithm (the control strategy). The relevance\nand efficiency of the control strategy largely determines the\nefficiency of the overall control system. Therefore, when-\never possible, control strategies should be designed with care,\nvia application of powerful and systematic methods of opti-\nmization and automatic control, rather than via questionable\nheuristics [1]. Traffic control strategies for urban road and\nfreeway networks is the main focus of this overview paper.\nC. A Basic Property\nFor the needs of this paper we will use a discrete-time\nrepresentation of traffic variables with discrete time index\nand time interval (or sampling time) . A\ntraffic volume or flow (in veh\/h) is defined as the number\nof vehicles crossing a corresponding location during the time\nperiod , divided by T. Traffic density (in\nveh\/km) is the number of vehicles included in a road segment\nof length at time kT, divided by . Mean speed (in\nFig. 2. A traffic network.\nkm\/h) is the average speed at time of all vehicles included\nin a road segment.\nWe consider a traffic network (Fig. 2) that receives de-\nmands (in veh\/h) at its origins and we\ndefine the total demand We as-\nsume that , is independent of any control\nmeasures taken in the network. We define exit flows at\nthe network destinations and the total exit flow\nWe wish to apply control mea-\nsures so as to minimize the total time spent in the network\nover a time horizon K, i.e.,\n(1)\nwhere is the total number of vehicles in the network at\ntime k. Due to conservation of vehicles we have\n(2)\nhence\n(3)\nSubstituting (3) in (1) we obtain\n(4)\nThe first two terms in the outer sum of (4) are independent\nof the control measures taken in the network; hence, mini-\nmization of is equivalent to maximization of the following\nquantity:\n(5)\nThus, minimization of the total time spent in a traffic net-\nwork is equivalent to maximization of the time-weighted exit\nflows. In other words, the earlier the vehicles are able to exit\nthe network (by appropriate use of the available control mea-\nsures) the less time they will have spent in the network.\nD. Traffic Congestion Revisited\nThe above basic property may be used to explain and quan-\ntify the degradation of the network infrastructure caused by\ntraffic congestion, as well as to demonstrate via simple math-\nematics the enormous potential of improvement via suitable\ntraffic control measures.\nAs an example, we consider (Fig. 3) two cases for a\nfreeway on-ramp, (a) without and (b) with metering control.\n2044 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 91, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2003\nFig. 3. Two cases, (a) without and (b) with ramp metering; grey\nareas indicate congestion zones.\nFig. 4. Two cases, (a) without and (b) with ramp metering.\nLet be the upstream freeway flow, be the ramp demand,\nbe the mainstream outflow in presence of congestion,\nand be the freeway capacity. It is well known that\nthe outflow at the head of the congestion is lower by\nsome 5%\u201310% than the freeway capacity . Note that\n(else the congestion would not have been\ncreated). In Fig. 3(b) we assume that ramp metering may be\nused to maintain capacity flow on the mainstream, e.g., by\nusing the control strategy ALINEA (see Section III-C). Of\ncourse, the application of ramp metering creates a queue at\nthe on-ramp but, because is greater than (increased\noutflow!), ramp metering leads to a reduction of the total\ntime spent (including the ramp waiting time). It is easy to\nshow that the amelioration (in %) of the total time\nspent is given by\n(6)\nFor example, if (i.e., the total demand ex-\nceeds the freeway capacity by 20%) and\n(i.e., the capacity drop due to the congestion is 5%) then\n% results from (6), which illustrates the level of\nachievable improvement.\nIn addition, we consider (Fig. 4) two cases of a freeway\nstretch that includes an on-ramp and an off-ramp, namely,\n(a) without and (b) with metering control. In order to clearly\nseparate the different sources of degradation, we will assume\nFig. 5. Detrimental effects of overspilling queues in urban road\nnetworks.\nhere that , i.e., no capacity drop due to conges-\ntion. Defining the exit rate as the portion of\nthe upstream flow that exits at the off-ramp, it is easy to show\nthat the exit flow without control is given by\n(7)\nwhile with metering control we have\n(8)\nBecause holds (else the conges-\ntion would not have been created), it follows that is less\nthan ; hence, ramp metering increases the outflow, thus\ndecreasing the total time spent in the system. It is easy to\nshow that the amelioration of the total time spent in this case\namounts to\n(9)\nFor example, if the exit rate is , then the ameliora-\ntion is %. If several upstream off-ramps are covered\nby the congestion in absence of ramp metering (which is typ-\nically the case in many freeways during rush hours) then the\namelioration achievable via introduction of ramp metering is\naccordingly higher.\nSumming up these effects in a freeway network, an overall\namelioration of total time spent by as much as 50% (i.e.,\nhalving of the average journey time) may readily result (see\nSection III-D) due to the increased throughput enabled by\nramp metering application.\nSimilar effects may be observed in saturated signal-\ncontrolled urban traffic networks (Fig. 5). A saturated link\nprevents the traffic movements at the upstream intersection\nto cross, even though they have the right of way (green\nsignal). This is a waste of resources (waste of green time)\nthat contributes to an accelerated increase of congestion due\nto vehicles trapped in the upstream links, which leads to\nblocking of further upstream intersections, increased waste\nof green time, and so forth [2]. This vicious circle frequently\nleads to gridlocks in network cycles with devastating effects\nfor the traffic flow in extended urban areas.\nPAPAGEORGIOU et al.: REVIEW OF ROAD TRAFFIC CONTROL STRATEGIES 2045\nFig. 6. Example of signal cycle.\nFig. 7. Cycle time and lost times.\nThe outlined phenomena make clear that the extended\ncongestion encountered daily in modern freeway and urban\nroad networks are not only due to excessive demand ex-\nceeding the network capacity. As a matter of fact, demand\nmay temporarily exceed the capacity of specific links\nleading to limited congestion. The infrastructure degrada-\ntion, however, caused by the initially limited congestion,\nleads to an unstable escalation when no suitable control sys-\ntems are employed to counter this devastating evolution. In\nconclusion, the observed extended (in both space and time)\ncongestion in modern metropolitan areas is indeed triggered\nby a temporarily and locally excessive demand, but it is\nexpanded and maintained due to the lack of suitable control\nactions that would prevent the corresponding infrastructure\ndegradation.\nII. ROAD TRAFFIC CONTROL\nA. Basic Notions\nTraffic lights at intersections is the major control mea-\nsure in urban road networks. Traffic lights were originally in-\nstalled in order to guarantee the safe crossing of antagonistic\nstreams of vehicles and pedestrians; with steadily increasing\ntraffic demands, it was soon realized that, once traffic lights\nexist, they may lead (under equally safe traffic conditions) to\nmore or less efficient network operations, hence there must\nexist an optimal control strategy leading to minimization of\nthe total time spent by all vehicles in the network.\nAlthough the corresponding optimal control problem may\nbe readily formulated for any road network, its real-time so-\nlution and realization in a control loop like the one of Fig. 1\nfaces a number of apparently insurmountable difficulties.\n\u2022 The red\u2013green switchings of traffic lights call for\nthe introduction of discrete variables, which renders\nthe optimization problem combinatorial.\n\u2022 The size of the problem for a whole network is\nvery large.\n\u2022 Many unpredictable and hardly measurable\ndisturbances (incidents, illegal parking, pedestrian\ncrossings, intersection blocking, etc.) may perturb\nthe traffic flow.\n\u2022 Measurements of traffic conditions are mostly\nlocal (via inductive loop detectors) and highly noisy\ndue to various effects.\n\u2022 There are tight real-time constraints, e.g., de-\ncision making within 2 s for advanced control\nsystems.\nThe combination of these difficulties renders the solution of\na detailed optimal control problem infeasible for more than\none intersection. Therefore, proposed control strategies for\nroad traffic control introduce a number of simplifications of\ndifferent kinds or address only a part of the related traffic\ncontrol problems. Unfortunately, most proposed simplifica-\ntions render the corresponding control strategies less suitable\nto address traffic saturation phenomena.\nAn intersection consists of a number of approaches and\nthe crossing area. An approach may have one or more lanes\nbut has a unique, independent queue. Approaches are used by\ncorresponding traffic streams (veh\/h). A saturation flow is\nthe average flow crossing the stop line of an approach when\nthe corresponding stream has right of way (r.o.w.), the up-\nstream demand (or the waiting queue) is sufficiently large,\nand the downstream links are not blocked by queues. Two\ncompatible streams can safely cross the intersection simulta-\nneously, else they are called antagonistic. A signal cycle is\none repetition of the basic series of signal combinations at\nan intersection; its duration is called cycle time . A stage (or\nphase) is a part of the signal cycle, during which one set of\nstreams has r.o.w. (Fig. 6). Constant lost (or intergreen) times\nof a few seconds are necessary between stages to avoid inter-\nference between antagonistic streams of consecutive stages\n(Fig. 7).\nThere are four possibilities for influencing traffic condi-\ntions via traffic lights operation.\n2046 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 91, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2003\n\u2022 Stage specification: For complex intersections\ninvolving a large number of streams, the specifi-\ncation of the optimal number and constitution of\nstages is a nontrivial task that can have a major im-\npact on intersection capacity and efficiency.\n\u2022 Split: This is the relative green duration of each\nstage (as a portion of the cycle time) that should be\noptimized according to the demand of the involved\nstreams.\n\u2022 Cycle time: Longer cycle times typically\nincrease the intersection capacity because the\nproportion of the constant lost times becomes ac-\ncordingly smaller; on the other hand, longer cycle\ntimes may increase vehicle delays in undersaturated\nintersections due to longer waiting times during the\nred phase.\n\u2022 Offset: This is the phase difference between\ncycles for successive intersections that may give\nrise to a \u201cgreen wave\u201d along an arterial; clearly,\nthe specification of offset should ideally take into\naccount the possible existence of vehicle queues.\nControl strategies employed for road traffic control may\nbe classified according to the following characteristics.\n\u2022 Fixed-time strategies for a given time of day\n(e.g., morning peak hour) are derived off-line by\nuse of appropriate optimization codes based on his-\ntorical constant demands and turning rates for each\nstream; traffic-responsive strategies make use of\nreal-time measurements (typically one or two in-\nductive loops per link) to calculate in real time the\nsuitable signal settings.\n\u2022 Isolated strategies are applicable to single inter-\nsections while coordinated strategies consider an\nurban zone or even a whole network comprising\nmany intersections.\n\u2022 Most available strategies are only applicable to\nundersaturated traffic conditions, whereby vehicle\nqueues are only created during the red phases and\nare dissolved during the green phases; very few\nstrategies (see Section II-D) are suitable also for\noversaturated conditions with partially increasing\nqueues that in many cases reach the upstream\nintersections.\nB. Isolated Intersection Control\n1) Fixed-Time Strategies: Isolated fixed-time strategies\nare only applicable to undersaturated traffic conditions.\nStage-based strategies under this class determine the\noptimal splits and cycle time so as to minimize the total\ndelay or maximize the intersection capacity. Phase-based\nstrategies determine not only optimal splits and cycle time\nbut also the optimal staging, which may be an important\nfeature for complex intersections.\nWell-known examples of stage-based strategies are\nSIGSET and SIGCAP proposed in [3] and [4]. Assuming\nprespecified stages, SIGSET and SIGCAP specify the splits\nand the cycle time . Note that\n(10)\nholds by definition, where , and is the total lost\ntime in a cycle. In order to avoid queue building, the fol-\nlowing capacity constraint must hold for each stream :\n(11)\nwhere and are the saturation flow and the demand, re-\nspectively, of stream ; is one if stream has r.o.w. at stage\n, and zero else. Inequality (11) requires that the demand\nof stream should not be higher than the maximum possible\nflow assigned to this stream. Finally, a maximum-cycle and\nminimum-green constraints are also taken into account.\nA nonlinear total delay function derived by Webster [5] for\nundersaturated conditions is used in SIGSET as an optimiza-\ntion objective. Thus, SIGSET solves a linearly constrained\nnonlinear programming problem to minimize the total in-\ntersection delay for given stream demands . On the other\nhand, SIGCAP may be used to maximize the intersection\u2019s\ncapacity as follows. Assume that the real demand is not\nas in (11) but with . SIGCAP replaces in\n(11) by and maximizes under the same constraints\nas SIGSET, which leads to a linear programming problem.\nNote that, for reasons mentioned earlier, capacity maxi-\nmization always leads to the maximum allowable cycle time.\nClearly, SIGCAP should be used for intersections with high\ndemand variability in order to prevent oversaturation, while\nSIGSET may be used under sufficient capacity margins by\nreplacing in (11) by , where are prespecified\nmargin parameters.\nPhase-based approaches [6] solve a similar problem, suit-\nably extended to consider different staging combinations.\nPhase-based approaches consider the compatibility relations\nof involved streams as prespecified and deliver the optimal\nstaging, splits, and cycle time, so as to minimize total delay or\nmaximize the intersection capacity. The resulting optimiza-\ntion problem is of the binary-mixed-integer-linear-program-\nming type, which calls for branch-and-bound methods for\nan exact solution. The related computation time is naturally\nmuch higher than for stage-based approaches, but this is of\nminor importance, as calculations are performed offline.\n2) Traffic-Responsive Strategies: Isolated, traffic-re-\nsponsive strategies make use of real-time measurements\nprovided by inductive loop detectors that are usually located\nsome 40 m upstream of the stop line, to execute some more\nor less sophisticated vehicle-actuation logic. One of the sim-\nplest strategies under this class is the vehicle-interval method\nthat is applicable to two-stage intersections. Minimum-green\ndurations are assigned to both stages. If no vehicle passes the\nrelated detectors during the minimum green of a stage, the\nstrategy proceeds to the next stage. If a vehicle is detected,\na critical interval (CI) is created, during which any detected\nvehicle leads to a green prolongation that allows the vehicle\nto cross the intersection. If no vehicle is detected during\nCI, the strategy proceeds to the next stage, else a new CI is\ncreated, and so forth, until a prespecified maximum-green\nvalue is reached. An extension of the method also considers\nthe traffic demand on the antagonistic approaches to decide\nwhether to proceed to the next stage or not.\nPAPAGEORGIOU et al.: REVIEW OF ROAD TRAFFIC CONTROL STRATEGIES 2047\nA more sophisticated version of this kind of strategies was\nproposed by Miller [7] and is included in the control tool\nMOVA [8]. Miller\u2019s strategy answers every seconds (e.g.,\n) the question: Should the switching to the next stage\ntake place now, or should this decision be postponed by T?\nTo answer this question, the strategy calculates (under certain\nsimplifying assumptions) the time gains and losses caused in\nall approaches if the decision is postponed by seconds.\nThe corresponding net time gains are com-\nbined in a single criterion , and\nif , the switching takes place immediately, else the de-\ncision is postponed until the next time step.\nA comparative field evaluation of these simple algorithms\nis presented in [9].\nC. Fixed-Time Coordinated Control\nThe most popular representatives of this class of strate-\ngies for urban networks are outlined below. By their nature,\nfixed-time strategies are only applicable to undersaturated\ntraffic conditions.\n1) MAXBAND: The first version of MAXBAND was de-\nveloped by Little [10]; see also [11]. MAXBAND considers\na two-way arterial with n signals (intersections)\nand specifies the corresponding offsets so as to maximize\nthe number of vehicles that can travel within a given speed\nrange without stopping at any signal (green wave); see Fig. 8.\nSplits are considered in MAXBAND as given (in accordance\nwith the lateral street demands); hence, the problem consists\nin placing the known red durations (see the horizontal lines\nof each signal in Fig. 8) of the arterial\u2019s signals so as\nto maximize the inbound and outbound bandwidths and\n, respectively. For an appropriate problem formulation, it\nis necessary to introduce some binary decision variables,\nwhich leads to a binary-mixed-integer-linear-programming\nproblem. The employed branch-and-bound solution method\nbenefits from a number of nice properties of this particular\nproblem to reduce the required computational effort. At-\ntempts to farther reduce the computational effort required\nby the method are reported in [12]. Little [10] extended\nthe basic MAXBAND method via incorporation of some\ncycle constraints to render it applicable also to networks\nof arterials; see also [15].\nMAXBAND has been applied to several road networks\nin North America and beyond. A number of significant\nextensions have been introduced in the original method in\norder to consider a variety of new aspects (see [13]) such\nas: time of clearance of existing queue, left-turn move-\nments, and different bandwidths for each link of the arterial\n(MULTIBAND) [14], [15].\n2) TRANSYT: TRANSYT was first developed by\nRobertson [16] but was substantially extended and enhanced\nlater. It is the most known and most frequently applied signal\ncontrol strategy, and it is often used as a reference method\nto test improvements enabled by real-time strategies. First\nfield implementations of TRANSYT-produced signal plans\nindicated savings of some 16% of the average travel time\nthrough the network.\nFig. 8. A maximum band along an arterial (after [10]).\nFig. 9. Structure of TRANSYT (after [16]).\nFig. 9 depicts the method\u2019s basic structure: TRANSYT\nis fed with the initial signal settings including the pre-\nspecified staging, the minimum green durations for each\nstage of each intersection, and the initial choice of splits,\noffsets, and cycle time. A unique cycle time or is\nconsidered for all network intersections in order to enable\noffset coordination. The network and traffic flow data\ncomprise the network\u2019s geometry, the saturation flows, the\nlink travel times, the constant and known turning rates for\neach intersection, and the constant and known demands.\nThe traffic model consists of nodes (intersections) and links\n(connecting streets). The concept of \u201cplatoon dispersion\u201d\n(dynamic first-order time-delay system) is used to model\nflow progression along a link. Oversaturated conditions\ncannot be described, although some improvement has been\nachieved in this respect in a recent enhanced release of the\nprogram [17]. The method proceeds in an iterative way:\nFor given values of the decision variables (control inputs),\ni.e., of splits, offsets, and cycle time, the dynamic network\nmodel calculates the corresponding performance index, e.g.,\nthe total number of vehicle stops. A heuristic \u201chill-climb\u201d\noptimization algorithm introduces small changes to the\ndecision variables and orders a new model run, and so forth,\nuntil a (local) minimum is found.\n3) Drawbacks of Fixed-Time Strategies: The main draw-\nback of fixed-time strategies is that their settings are based\non historical rather than real-time data. This may be a crude\nsimplification for the following reasons.\n2048 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 91, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2003\n\u2022 Demands are not constant, even within a\ntime-of-day.\n\u2022 Demands may vary at different days, e.g., due to\nspecial events.\n\u2022 Demands change in the long term leading to\n\u201caging\u201d of the optimized settings.\n\u2022 Turning movements are also changing in the\nsame ways as demands; in addition, turning move-\nments may change due to the drivers\u2019 response to\nthe new optimized signal settings, whereby they try\nto minimize their individual travel times [18].\n\u2022 Incidents and farther disturbances may perturb\ntraffic conditions in a nonpredictable way.\nFor all these reasons, traffic-responsive coordinated strate-\ngies, if suitably designed, are potentially more efficient, but\nalso more costly, as they require the installation, operation,\nand maintenance of a real-time control system (sensors, com-\nmunications, central control room, local controllers).\nD. Coordinated Traffic-Responsive Strategies\n1) SCOOT: SCOOT was first developed by Robertson\u2019s\nteam [19] and has been extended later in several respects.\nIt is considered to be the traffic-responsive version of\nTRANSYT and has been applied to over 150 cities in the\nUnited Kingdom and elsewhere. SCOOT utilizes traffic\nvolume and occupancy (similar to traffic density) measure-\nments from the upstream end of the network links. It runs in\na central control computer and employs a philosophy similar\nto TRANSYT. More precisely, SCOOT includes a network\nmodel that is fed with real measurements (instead of histor-\nical values) and is run repeatedly in real time to investigate\nthe effect of incremental changes of splits, offsets, and cycle\ntime at individual intersections (functionally decentralized\noperation). If the changes turn out to be beneficial (in\nterms of a performance index), they are submitted to the\nlocal signal controllers; see [20] for a comparative field\nevaluation. SCOOT\u2019s performance deteriorates in case of\nsaturated traffic conditions.\n2) Model-Based Optimization Methods: More recently,\na number of more rigorous model-based traffic-responsive\nstrategies have been developed: OPAC [21], PRODYN [22],\nCRONOS [23], RHODES [24]. These strategies do not con-\nsider explicitly splits, offsets, or cycles. Based on prespec-\nified staging, they calculate in real time the optimal values\nof the next few switching times over a fu-\nture time horizon , starting from the current time and\nthe currently applied stage. To obtain the optimal switching\ntimes, these methods solve in real time a dynamic optimiza-\ntion problem employing realistic dynamic traffic models with\na sampling time of 2\u20135 s, fed with traffic measurements.\nThe models include discrete variables to reflect the impact\nof red\/green phases on traffic flow. Several constraints, e.g.,\nfor maximum and minimum splits, are included. The typical\nperformance index to be minimized is the total time spent by\nall vehicles.\nThe rolling horizon procedure (similar to model pre-\ndictive control approaches [25]) is employed for real-time\napplication of the results. Hereby, the optimization problem\nis solved in real time over a time horizon (e.g., 60 s)\nusing measurement-based initial traffic conditions and\ndemand predictions over , but results are applied only\nfor a much shorter roll period (e.g., 4 s), after which new\nmeasurements are collected and a new optimization problem\nis solved over an equally long time horizon , and so\nforth. The rolling horizon procedure avoids myopic control\nactions while embedding a dynamic optimization problem\nin a traffic-responsive (real-time) environment.\nThe basic problem faced by these strategies is due to the\npresence of discrete variables that require exponential-com-\nplexity algorithms for a global minimization. In fact, OPAC\nemploys complete enumeration (assuming integer switching\ntimes) while PRODYN and RHODES employ dynamic pro-\ngramming. Due to the exponential complexity of these solu-\ntion algorithms, the control strategies (though conceptually\napplicable to a whole network) are not real-time feasible for\nmore than one intersection. Hence, we end up with a number\nof decentralized (by intersection) optimal strategies, whose\nactions may be coordinated heuristically by a superior con-\ntrol layer (see, e.g., [26], [27]). On the other hand, CRONOS\nemploys a heuristic global optimization method with poly-\nnomial complexity which allows for simultaneous considera-\ntion of several intersections, albeit for the price of specifying\na local (rather than the global) minimum.\n3) Store-and-Forward Based Approaches: Store-and-\nforward modeling of traffic networks was first suggested\nby Gazis and Potts [28], [29] and has since been used in\nvarious works notably for road traffic control [30]\u2013[39].\nThe main idea when using store-and-forward models for\nroad traffic control is to introduce a model simplification\nthat enables the mathematical description of the traffic\nflow process without use of discrete variables. This is of\nparamount importance because it opens the way to the\napplication of a number of highly efficient optimization and\ncontrol methods (such as linear programming, quadratic\nprogramming, nonlinear programming, and multivariable\nregulators) with polynomial complexity, which, on its turn,\nallows for coordinated control of large-scale networks in\nreal time, even under saturated traffic conditions.\nThe critical simplification is introduced when modeling\nthe outflow of a stream . Assuming sufficient demand on\nthe link, the outflow at discrete time is set\n(12)\nwhere is the green time duration for this stream and\nis the corresponding saturation flow. If the sampling time\nis equal to the cycle time , Fig. 10 illustrates that in\n(12) is equal to the average flow during the corresponding\ncycle, rather than equal to during the green phase and\nequal to zero during the red phase (this corresponds to a\npulse width modulation in electrical engineering). In other\nwords, (12) suggests that there is a continuous (uninter-\nrupted) outflow from each network link (as long as there is\nsufficient demand). The consequences of this simplification\nare as follows.\nPAPAGEORGIOU et al.: REVIEW OF ROAD TRAFFIC CONTROL STRATEGIES 2049\nFig. 10. Simplified modeling of link outflow u .\n1) The sampling time of the discrete-time rep-\nresentation cannot be shorter than the cycle time ;\nhence, real-time decisions cannot be taken more fre-\nquently than at every cycle.\n2) The oscillations of vehicle queues in the links\ndue to green\/red commutations are not described by\nthe model.\n3) The effect of offset for consecutive intersections\ncannot be described by the model.\nDespite these consequences, the appropriate use of\nstore-and-forward models may lead to efficient coordinated\ncontrol strategies for large-scale networks as demonstrated\nin simulation studies in some of the aforementioned refer-\nences. In fact, the use of (12) leads to a linear state-space\nmodel for road networks of arbitrary size, topology, and\ncharacteristics [40], [41] (bold variables indicate vectors\nand matrices)\n(13)\nwhere the state is the vector of the numbers of vehicles\nin network links ; and are constant matrices re-\nflecting the network characteristics; and\n(the control input) is the vector of green\ntimes for each stage in all intersections of the network,\nwhile comprises some corresponding constant nominal\ngreen times (the disturbance vector) and comprise\nthe demand flows and the constant nominal flows re-\nspectively. Suitable bounds for minimum green times and\nmaximum storage capacity of links must also be considered\n[40].\nIn order to minimize the risk of oversaturation and the\nspillback of link queues, one may attempt to minimize and\nbalance the links\u2019 relative occupancies where\n(in veh) is the storage capacity of link . A quadratic\ncriterion that considers this control objective has the general\nform\n(14)\nwhere and are nonnegative definite, diagonal weighting\nmatrices. The first term in (14) accounts for minimization\nand balancing of the relative occupancies of the network\nlinks. To this end, the diagonal elements of are set equal\nto [42]. Furthermore, the magnitude of the control\nreactions can be influenced by the choice of the weighting\nmatrix . To this end, the choice of may be per-\nformed via a trial-and-error procedure so as to achieve a\nsatisfactory control behavior for a given application network.\nThe outlined optimization problem is of the quadratic pro-\ngramming type and may be readily solved by use of broadly\navailable codes even for large-scale networks. For a real-time\napplication, the corresponding algorithm may be embedded\nin a rolling horizon procedure. Alternatively one may neglect\nthe future demand in (13); set the optimization horizon\nin (14); and apply the control bounds externally [42].\nUnder these assumptions one obtains a Linear-Quadratic-\nRegulator problem, which permits a closed-loop (feedback)\nsolution\n(15)\nwhere the gain matrix results as a straightforward solution\nof the corresponding discrete-time Riccati equation. This is\nthe multivariable regulator approach taken by the signal con-\ntrol strategy TUC [41], [42] to calculate in real time the net-\nwork splits, while cycle time and offset are calculated by\nother parallel algorithms [43]. TUC has been implemented\nand is currently operational in a part of Glasgow, U.K.\u2019s [44]\nand Chania, Greece\u2019s [45] urban networks with quite satis-\nfactory results, particularly under saturated traffic conditions.\nFig. 11 illustrates instances of some recent simulation\nresults obtained via application of TUC within the micro-\nscopic traffic flow simulator AIMSUN [46] for a part of the\nurban network of Tel Aviv, Israel [43] (notice a light-rail line\nbetween the opposite directions of vehicle lanes). The left\ncolumn of Fig. 11 [i.e., (a), (c), and (e)] displays the traffic\nsituation in a network part at 7:30 A.M., 8:00 A.M., 8:30\nA.M., respectively, under fixed-time signal control settings\nthat were optimized according to the utilized morning-peak\ndemand. The right column of Fig. 11 [i.e., (b), (d), and (f)]\ndisplays the same network part at the same times when\nTUC is applied under identical demands. It may be seen\nthat at 7:30 A.M. under fixed-time control, long vehicle\nqueues are created at internal links. The resulting queue\nspillback phenomena limit the network throughput and lead\nto the development of queues even at some origin links [see\nFig. 11(c) and (e)]. In contrast, TUC manages to keep the\nlink queues within limits, thus protecting upstream inter-\nsections from detrimental queue spillback and maintaining\na high network throughput. As a result, traffic conditions\nunder TUC are back to normal at 8:30 A.M. (the demand has\nbeen served), while long queues persist under fixed control\nat the same time [Fig. 11(e) and (f), respectively].\nFor further theoretical developments on control strategies\napplicable to saturated traffic conditions, see [2], [47]\u2013[49].\nE. Integrated Urban-Freeway Traffic Control\nModern metropolitan traffic networks include both urban\nroads and freeways and employ a variety of control mea-\nsures such as signal control, ramp metering (see Section III),\nvariable message signs and route guidance (see Section IV).\nTraditionally, control strategies for each type of control\nmeasure are designed and implemented separately, which\nmay result in antagonistic actions and lack of synergy among\ndifferent control strategies and actions. However, modern\ntraffic networks that include various infrastructure types, are\n2050 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 91, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2003\nFig. 11. Comparative microscopic simulation results using fixed-time signal control at (a) 7:30\nA.M., (c) 8:00 A.M. (e) 8:30 A.M.; and TUC at (b) 7:30 A.M., (d) 8:00 A.M., (f) 8:30 A.M.\nperceived by the users as an entity, and all included control\nmeasures, regardless of their type or location, ultimately\nserve the same goal of higher network efficiency. Integrated\ncontrol strategies should consider all control measures\nsimultaneously toward a common control objective. Despite\nsome preliminary works on this subject (see [50], for an\nearly status report), the problem of control integration is\nquite difficult due to its high dimensions that reflect the\ngeographical extension of the traffic network [39], [40],\n[51]\u2013[55]. For this reason, it appears that store-and-forward\nmodeling (at least for the urban road part) might be the\nonly feasible way to design and operate in real time a\nunique integrated control strategy. The aforementioned\nGlasgow implementation covers in fact control measures\nof various types (signal control, ramp metering, variable\nmessage signs) via partial interconnection of three feedback\nstrategies [44], see Fig. 12; the displayed integrated control\nstrategy IN-TUC incorporates the partly cooperating feed-\nback strategies TUC for signal control (see Section II-D),\nALINEA for ramp metering (see Section III-C), and a\nreactive one-shot route guidance strategy for user optimum\n(see Section IV-C).\nIII. FREEWAY TRAFFIC CONTROL\nA. Motivation\nFreeways had been originally conceived so as to provide\nvirtually unlimited mobility to road users, without the an-\nnoyance of flow interruptions by traffic lights. The rapid in-\ncrease of traffic demand, however, led soon to increasingly\nsevere congestions, both recurrent (occurring daily during\nrush hours) and nonrecurrent (due to incidents). The increas-\ningly congested freeways within and around metropolitan\nareas resemble the urban traffic networks before introduc-\ntion of traffic lights: Chaotic conditions at intersections, long\nqueues, degraded infrastructure utilization, reduced safety.\nAt the present stage, responsible authorities have not fully\nrealized that the expensive freeway or freeway-network in-\nfrastructure is strongly underutilized on a daily basis due to\nthe lack of efficient and comprehensive traffic control sys-\ntems (see Section I-D). In other words, the expensive infra-\nstructure is intended to deliver a nominal capacity that is not\navailable (due to congestion), ironically, exactly at the time\nit is most urgently needed (during peak hours).\nThe control measures that are typically employed in\nfreeway networks are the following.\n\u2022 Ramp metering, activated via installation of\ntraffic lights at on-ramps or freeway interchanges.\n\u2022 Link control that comprises a number of pos-\nsibilities including lane control, variable speed\nlimits, congestion warning, tidal (reversable) flow,\nkeep-lane instructions, etc.\n\u2022 Driver information and guidance systems, ei-\nther by use of roadside variable message signs or\nvia two-way communication with equipped vehi-\ncles (see Section IV).\nRamp metering is the most direct and efficient way to con-\ntrol and upgrade freeway traffic. Various positive effects are\nachievable if ramp metering is appropriately applied:\n\u2022 increase in mainline throughput due to avoid-\nance or reduction of congestion;\n\u2022 increase in the served volume due to avoidance\nof blocked off-ramps or freeway interchanges;\n\u2022 utilization of possible reserve capacity on par-\nallel arterials;\n\u2022 efficient incident response;\n\u2022 improved traffic safety due to reduced conges-\ntion and safer merging.\nSome recent studies have demonstrated that efficient ramp\nmetering strategies (employing optimal control algorithms)\nPAPAGEORGIOU et al.: REVIEW OF ROAD TRAFFIC CONTROL STRATEGIES 2051\nFig. 12. Functional architecture of IN-TUC strategy as implemented in Glasgow, U.K.\nmay provide spectacular improvements (50% reduction of\ntotal time spent) in large-scale freeway networks [56], [58].\nThis may also be demonstrated via suitable treatment of real\n(congested) freeway traffic data; see [59].\nB. Fixed-Time Ramp Metering Strategies\nFixed-time ramp metering strategies are derived off-line\nfor particular times of day, based on constant historical\ndemands, without use of real-time measurements. They\nare based on simple static models. A freeway with several\non-ramps and off-ramps is subdivided into sections, each\ncontaining at most one on-ramp. We then have\n(16)\nwhere is the mainline flow of section is the on-ramp\nvolume of section , and expresses the (known)\nportion of vehicles that enter the freeway in section and\ndo not exit the freeway upstream of section . To avoid\ncongestion\n(17)\nmust hold, where is the capacity of section . Further\nconstraints are\n(18)\nwhere is the demand at on-ramp . This approach was first\nsuggested by Wattleworth [60]. Other similar formulations\nmay be found in [61]\u2013[66].\nAs an objective criterion, one may wish to maximize\nthe number of served vehicles (which is equivalent to\nminimizing the total time spent [67])\n(19)\nor to maximize the total travel distance\n(20)\n(where is the length of section j), or to balance the ramp\nqueues\n(21)\nThese formulations lead to linear programming or\nquadratic programming problems that may be readily solved\n2052 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 91, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2003\nby use of broadly available computer codes. An extension\nof these methods that renders the static model (16) dynamic\nby introduction of constant travel times for each section was\nsuggested in [68].\nThe drawbacks of fixed-time ramp metering strategies\nare identical to the ones discussed under road traffic\ncontrol (Section II-C). In addition, fixed-time ramp me-\ntering strategies may lead (due to the absence of real-time\nmeasurements) either to overload of the mainstream flow\n(congestion) or to underutilization of the freeway. In fact,\nramp metering is an efficient but also delicate control mea-\nsure. If ramp metering strategies are not accurate enough,\nthen congestion may not be prevented from forming, or\nthe mainstream capacity may be underutilized (e.g., due to\ngroundlessly strong metering).\nC. Reactive Ramp Metering Strategies\nReactive ramp metering strategies are employed at a tac-\ntical level, i.e., in the aim of keeping the freeway traffic con-\nditions close to prespecified set values, based on real-time\nmeasurements.\n1) Local Ramp Metering: Local ramp metering strate-\ngies make use of traffic measurements in the vicinity of\na ramp to calculate suitable ramp metering values. The\ndemand-capacity strategy [69], quite popular in North\nAmerica, reads\n(22)\nwhere (Fig. 13) is the freeway capacity downstream of\nthe ramp, is the freeway flow measurement upstream of\nthe ramp, is the freeway occupancy (similar to density)\nmeasurement downstream of the ramp, is the critical oc-\ncupancy [at which the freeway flow becomes maximum; see\nFig. 13(c)], and is a prespecified minimum admissible\nramp flow value. The strategy (22) attempts to add to the last\nmeasured upstream flow as much ramp flow\nas necessary to reach the downstream freeway capacity .\nIf, however, for some reason, the downstream measured oc-\ncupancy becomes overcritical (i.e., a congestion may\nform), the ramp flow is reduced to the minimum flow\nto avoid or to dissolve the congestion.\nComparing the control problem in hand with Fig. 1, it\nbecomes clear that the ramp flow r is a control input, the\ndownstream occupancy is an output, while the upstream\nfreeway flow is a disturbance. Hence, (22) does not\nreally represent a closed-loop strategy but an open-loop\ndisturbance-rejection policy (Fig. 13(a)) which is generally\nknown to be quite sensitive to various further nonmeasurable\ndisturbances.\nThe occupancy strategy [69] is based on the same\nphilosophy as the demand-capacity strategy, but it relies on\noccupancy-based estimation of , which may, under certain\nconditions, reduce the corresponding implementation cost.\nAn alternative, closed-loop ramp metering strategy\n(ALINEA), suggested in [70], reads\n(23)\nFig. 13. Local ramp metering strategies: (a) Demand capacity.\n(b) ALINEA. (c) Fundamental diagram.\nwhere is a regulator parameter and is a set\n(desired) value for the downstream occupancy [typically,\nbut not necessarily, may be set, in which case\nthe downstream freeway flow becomes close to , see\nFig. 13(c)]. ALINEA is obviously an integral regulator;\nhence, it is easily seen that at a stationary state (i.e., if\nis constant), results from (23), although no\nmeasurements of the inflow are explicitly used in the\nstrategy. In field experiments, ALINEA has not been very\nsensitive to the choice of the regulator parameter .\nNote that the demand-capacity strategy reacts to exces-\nsive occupancies only after a threshold value is\nexceeded, and in a rather crude way, while ALINEA reacts\nsmoothly even to slight differences , and thus it\nmay prevent congestion by stabilizing the traffic flow at a\nhigh throughput level. Fig. 14 displays a sample from a field\nimplementation of ALINEA in Glasgow, U.K. It may be seen\nthat the measured downstream occupancy is maintained\nclose to its set value of 26% except for the final phase where\nthe ramp demand is not sufficient to feed the mainstream.\nThe set value may be changed any time, and thus ALINEA\nmay be embedded into a hierarchical control system with set\nPAPAGEORGIOU et al.: REVIEW OF ROAD TRAFFIC CONTROL STRATEGIES 2053\nFig. 14. A sample from the Glasgow implementation of ALINEA.\nvalues of the individual ramps being specified in real time by\na superior coordination level or by an operator.\nAll control strategies calculate suitable ramp volumes .\nIn the case of traffic-cycle realization of ramp metering, is\nconverted to a green-phase duration by use of\n(24)\nwhere c is the fixed cycle time and is the ramp\u2019s sat-\nuration flow. The green-phase duration is constrained by\n, where to avoid ramp closure, and\n. In the case of an one-car-per-green realization,\na constant-duration green phase permits exactly one vehicle\nto pass. Thus, the ramp volume is controlled by varying\nthe red-phase duration between a minimum and a maximum\nvalue. Note that ALINEA is also applicable directly to the\ngreen or red-phase duration, by combining (23) and (24)\n(25)\nwhere . Note also that the values\nor used on the right-hand side of (23) or (25), re-\nspectively, should be the bounded values of the previous time\nstep (i.e., after application of the and constraints)\nin order to avoid the windup phenomenon in the I-regulator.\nIf the queue of vehicles on the ramp becomes excessive,\ninterference with surface street traffic may occur. This may\nbe detected with suitably placed detectors (on the upstream\npart of the on-ramp), leading to an override of the regulator\u2019s\ndecisions to allow more vehicles to enter the freeway and the\nramp queue to diminish.\nComparative field trials have been conducted in various\ncountries to assess and compare the efficiency of local ramp\nmetering strategies; see, e.g., [71]. One of these trials took\nplace at the on-ramp Bran\u00e7ion of the clockwise direction\nof the Boulevard P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique (ringway) in Paris. Several\nramp metering strategies were applied over a period of\none month each, and 13 typical days (without incidents)\nper strategy were selected for comparison. The evaluation\ncriteria included total travel time (TTT) on the mainstream;\ntotal waiting time (TWT) at the ramp; total time spent\nTTS TTT TWT ; total travel distance (TTD); mean\nspeed MS TTD TTS ; and mean congestion duration\n(MCD), which is the accumulated period of time during the\nmorning peak whereby the measured occupancy is higher\nthan . Table 1 displays an extract of the comparative\nresults for the period 7:00 A.M. to 10:00 A.M. It can be seen\nthat ALINEA outperforms feedforward-based strategies\nwith respect to all evaluation criteria; see [72] and [73] for\nfurther field applications.\n2) Multivariable Regulator Strategies: Multivariable\nregulators for ramp metering pursue the same goals as\nlocal ramp metering strategies: they attempt to operate\nthe freeway traffic conditions near some prespecified set\n(desired) values. While local ramp metering is performed\nindependently for each ramp, based on local measurements,\nmultivariable regulators make use of all available main-\nstream measurements , on a freeway\nstretch, to calculate simultaneously the ramp volume values\n, for all controllable ramps included in\nthe same stretch [74].\nThis provides potential improvements over local ramp\nmetering because of more comprehensive information provi-\nsion and coordinated control actions. Multivariable regulator\napproaches to ramp metering have been mostly derived\nby application of the Linear-Quadratic-Regulator (LQR)\ntheory [75]\u2013[86]. The multivariable regulator strategy MET-\nALINE may be viewed as a generalization and extension\nof ALINEA, whereby the metered on-ramp volumes are\ncalculated from\n(26)\n2054 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 91, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2003\nTable 1 Comparative Field Results of Local Ramp Metering\nwhere is the vector of controllable\non-ramp volumes, is the vector of mea-\nsured occupancies on the freeway stretch,\nis a subset of that includes occupancy locations for\nwhich prespecified set values may be\ngiven. Note that for control-theoretic reasons, the number of\nset-valued occupancies cannot be higher than the number\nof controlled on-ramps. Typically one bottleneck location\ndownstream of each controlled on-ramp is selected for\ninclusion in the vector . Finally, and are the\nregulator\u2019s constant gain matrices that must be suitably\ndesigned; see [74], [87] for details.\nField trials and simulation results comparing the effi-\nciency of METALINE versus ALINEA lead to the following\nconclusions.\n\u2022 While ALINEA requires hardly any design\neffort, METALINE application calls for a rather\nsophisticated design procedure that is based on\nadvanced control-theoretic methods (LQR optimal\ncontrol).\n\u2022 For urban freeways with a high density of\non-ramps, METALINE was found to provide no\nadvantages over ALINEA (the latter implemented\nindependently at each controllable on-ramp) under\nrecurrent congestion.\n\u2022 In the case of nonrecurrent congestion (e.g., due\nto an incident), METALINE performs better than\nALINEA due to more comprehensive measurement\ninformation.\nSome system operators hesitate to apply ramp metering\nbecause of the concern that congestion may be conveyed\nfrom the freeway to the adjacent street network. In fact,\na ramp metering application designed to avoid or reduce\ncongestion on freeways may have both positive and negative\neffects on the adjacent road network traffic. It is easy to\nsee, based on notions and statements made earlier, that, if\nan efficient control strategy is applied for ramp metering,\nthe freeway throughput will be generally increased. More\nprecisely, ramp metering at the beginning of the rush hour\nmay lead to on-ramp queues in order to prevent congestion to\nform on the freeway, which may temporarily lead to diversion\ntoward the urban network. But due to congestion avoidance\nor reduction, the freeway will be eventually enabled to\naccommodate a higher throughput, thus attracting drivers\nfrom urban paths and leading to an improved overall network\nperformance. This positive impact of ramp metering on both\nthe freeway and the adjacent road network traffic conditions\nwas confirmed in a specially designed field evaluation in\nthe Corridor P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique in Paris, see [88].\nD. Nonlinear Optimal Ramp Metering Strategies\nPrevention or reduction of traffic congestion on freeway\nnetworks may dramatically improve the infrastructure effi-\nciency in terms of throughput and total time spent. Conges-\ntion on limited-capacity freeways forms because too many\nvehicles attempt to use them in a noncoordinated (uncon-\ntrolled) way. As illustrated in Section I-D, once congestion is\nbuilt up, the outflow from the congestion area is reduced, and\nthe off-ramps and interchanges covered by the congestion are\nblocked, which may in some extreme cases even lead to grid-\nlocks. Reactive ramp metering strategies may be helpful to a\ncertain extent, but, first they need appropriate set values, and,\nsecond, the scope of their actions is more or less local. What\nis needed for freeway networks or long freeway stretches\nis a superior coordination level that calculates in real time\noptimal set values from a proactive, strategic point of view.\nSuch an optimal control strategy should explicitly take into\naccount:\n\u2022 the current traffic state both on the freeway and\non the on-ramps;\n\u2022 demand predictions over a sufficiently long time\nhorizon;\nPAPAGEORGIOU et al.: REVIEW OF ROAD TRAFFIC CONTROL STRATEGIES 2055\n\u2022 the limited storage capacity of the on-ramps;\n\u2022 the ramp metering constraints discussed earlier;\n\u2022 the nonlinear traffic flow dynamics, including\nthe infrastructure\u2019s limited capacity;\n\u2022 any incidents currently present in the freeway\nnetwork.\nBased on this comprehensive information, the control\nstrategy should deliver set values for the overall freeway\nnetwork over a future time horizon so as to:\n\u2022 respect all present constraints;\n\u2022 minimize an objective criterion such as the total\ntime spent in the whole network including the\non-ramps;\n\u2022 consider equity aspects for users of different\nramps in the network [56], [85].\nSuch a comprehensive dynamic optimal control problem\nmay be formulated and solved with moderate computation\ntime by use of suitable numerical algorithms.\nThe nonlinear traffic dynamics may be expressed by use\nof suitable macroscopic dynamic models in the state-space\nform [56], [57]\n(27)\nwhere the state vector comprises all traffic densities and\nmean speeds of 500-m-long freeway sections, as well as\nall ramp queues; the control vector comprises all control-\nlable ramp volumes; the disturbance vector comprises\nall on-ramp demands and turning rates at bifurcations\n(including off-ramps). Generally, the evolution of traffic\ndensity is described via the conservation-of-vehicles equa-\ntion, while the mean speed is calculated via an empirical\n(static or dynamic) equation in dependence of the traffic\ndensity. Finally the traffic flow is by definition The\nramp metering constraints are given by (18) while the queue\nconstraints read\n(28)\nwhere are queue lengths. The total time spent in the whole\nsystem over a time horizon may be expressed\n(29)\nThus, for given current (initial) state from corre-\nsponding measurements, and given disturbance predictions\n, the problem consists in specifying\nthe ramp flows , so as to minimize\nthe total time spent (29) subject to the nonlinear traffic flow\ndynamics (27) and the constraints (18) and (28).\nThis problem or variations thereof was considered and\nsolved in various works [56], [67], [89]\u2013[96]. Although\nsimulation studies indicate substantial savings of travel\ntime and substantial increase of throughput [56], advanced\ncontrol strategies of this kind have not been implemented in\nthe field as of yet.\nFig. 15 displays an example of (simulated) optimal control\napplication using the generic software tool AMOC (see Sec-\ntion III-E) for the Amsterdam ringroad A10 (counter-clock-\nwise direction only) over a typical morning-peak period\nof 4 h [56]. The freeway A10 in the considered direction\nhas a length of 32 km and includes 21 on-ramps and 20\noff-ramps (thereof 4 freeway interchanges with A1, A2, A4,\nA8); see Fig. 15(a). When no ramp metering is applied, the\nexcessive demand coupled with the uncontrolled entrance of\ndrivers into the mainstream, causes a time-space extended\ncongestion [i.e., very high density values in Fig. 15(b)] that\nblocks almost half of the freeway off-ramps, thus leading to\na strongly reduced throughput as explained in Section I-D.\nWith application of optimal ramp metering, congestion\nis avoided [Fig. 15(c)], throughput is maximized, and the\ntotal time spent by all vehicles (including waiting time at\nthe ramps) is reduced by 43.5% compared to no control.\nMoreover, in contrast to the no-control case, there is no\ncongestion spillback from A10 into the merging freeway A4\nwhen optimal ramp metering is applied.\nE. Integrated Freeway Network Traffic Control\nAs mentioned earlier, modern freeway networks may in-\nclude different types of control measures. The corresponding\ncontrol strategies are usually designed and implemented in-\ndependently, thus failing to exploit the synergistic effects\nthat might result from coordination of the respective con-\ntrol actions. An advanced concept for integrated freeway\nnetwork control may result from suitable extension of the\noptimal control approach outlined above. More precisely,\nthe dynamic model (27) of freeway traffic flow may be\nextended to enable the inclusion of further control mea-\nsures, beyond the ramp metering rates . Formally\nis then replaced in (27) by a general control input vector\nthat comprises all implemented control measures of\nany type. Such an approach was implemented in the in-\ntegrated freeway network control tool AMOC [97] where\nramp metering and route guidance (see Section IV) are\nconsidered simultaneously with promising results; see also\n[98]\u2013[102].\nF. Link Control\nLink control may include one or a combination of the fol-\nlowing actions:\n\u2022 variable speed limitation;\n\u2022 changeable message signs with indications\nfor \u201ckeep lane,\u201d or congestion warning, or envi-\nronmental warning (e.g., information about the\npavement state);\n\u2022 lane control measures (e.g., prohibited lane use\nupstream of heavily used on-ramps or incident\nlocations);\n\u2022 incident or congestion warning;\n\u2022 reversable flow lanes (tidal flow).\nThere are many freeway stretches, particularly in Ger-\nmany, in The Netherlands, and, more recently, in the United\nKingdom, employing a selection of these measures. It is\ngenerally thought that control measures of this kind lead to\na homogenization of traffic flow (i.e., more homogeneous\n2056 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 91, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2003\nFig. 15.

Very few systematic studies have been\nconducted to quantify the impact of these control measures\n(see e.g., [103], [104]) and corresponding validated math-\nPAPAGEORGIOU et al.: REVIEW OF ROAD TRAFFIC CONTROL STRATEGIES 2057\nematical models are currently lacking. This is one of the\nreasons why the corresponding control strategies of oper-\nating systems are of a heuristic character (e.g., [105]\u2013[108]),\nwhile more systematic approaches are based on nonvalidated\nmodeling assumptions [82], [101], [102], [109].\nIV. ROUTE GUIDANCE AND DRIVER INFORMATION\nA. Introduction\nFreeway, urban, or mixed traffic networks include a\nlarge number of origins and destinations with multiple\npaths connecting each origin-destination pair. Fixed di-\nrection signs at bifurcation nodes of the network typically\nindicate the direction that is time-shortest in absence of\ncongestion. However, during rush hours, the travel time on\nmany routes changes substantially due to traffic congestion\nand alternative routes may become competitive. Drivers\nwho are familiar with the traffic conditions in a network\n(e.g., commuters) optimize their individual routes based\non their past experience, thus leading to the celebrated\nuser-equilibrium conditions, first formulated by Wardrop\n[110]. But daily varying demands, changing environmental\nconditions, exceptional events (sport events, fairs, concerts,\netc.) and, most importantly, incidents may change the traffic\nconditions in a nonpredictable way. This may lead to an\nunderutilization of the overall network\u2019s capacity, whereby\nsome links are heavily congested while capacity reserves are\navailable on alternative routes. Route guidance and driver\ninformation systems (RGDIS) may be employed to improve\nthe network efficiency via direct or indirect recommendation\nof alternative routes (see [111] for a critical view).\nA first classification of RGDIS distinguishes pretrip from\nen route advice. Pretrip communication possibilities include\nthe internet, phone services, mobile devices, television, and\nradio. These communication devices may be consulted by a\npotential road user to make a rational decision regarding:\n\u2022 effectuation or postponement of the intended\ntrip;\n\u2022 choice of transport mode (car, bus, underground,\netc.);\n\u2022 choice of the departure time;\n\u2022 (initial) path choice.\nIf the road user has decided to complete the trip by car,\nshe may continue to receive information or advice via appro-\npriate en-route devices such as radio services (RDS-TMC),\nroad-side variable message sings (VMS), or special in-car\nequipment, in order to make sensible routing decisions at\nbifurcation nodes of the network. While radio broadcasting\nservices and VMS have been in use for more than 25 years\n(and their number is steadily increasing) (see [112], see also\n[113] for an early overview), individual route guidance sys-\ntems employing in-car devices and two-way communication\nwith control centers are in their infancy (some experimental\nor early operational systems exist in some countries) [114].\nAt this point, it is appropriate to distinguish among two\nalternative policies (which in some cases may be combined)\nof providing en-route information versus explicit route rec-\nommendation. Many operators (particularly of VMS-based\nsystems) prefer the provision of real-time information. Also\nthe majority of drivers (according to some questionnaire re-\nsults) seem to prefer this option that enables them to make\ntheir own decisions, rather than having to follow recommen-\ndations by an anonymous system. It should be emphasized,\nhowever, that pure information provision has a number of\npartially significant drawbacks.\n\u2022 The translation of provided information into\nrouting decisions requires the knowledge of the\nnetwork which may not be present for all drivers.\n\u2022 Although the control center disposes over com-\nplete information about the traffic conditions in\nthe whole network, only a tiny part of this infor-\nmation can be conveyed to the users due to space\nlimitations on the VMS and other devices. In some\ncases, only information about the traffic conditions\non the downstream links of a bifurcation node are\nprovided. Clearly, this information is not sufficient\nfor a rational route decision for drivers with longer\ntrips through the network, who may be eventually\ntrapped into a severe congestion due to myopic\ndecision making.\n\u2022 Even if it would be possible to provide more\ncomprehensive information, the drivers would have\nto make a route decision within a few seconds, i.e.,\nafter looking at the VMS and before reaching the\nbifurcation.\n\u2022 There is no possibility for the operator or a con-\ntrol strategy to actively influence traffic conditions,\nas decisions are left with the drivers.\nOn the other hand, route guidance systems are constrained\nby the requirement not to suggest routes that would disben-\nefit complying drivers, else the credibility and eventually the\nimpact of the whole system may be jeopardized. Moreover,\nroute guidance systems call for a genuine control strategy\nthat can optimize the network traffic conditions, e.g., by\navoiding traffic congestion on alternative recommended\nroutes due to drivers\u2019 overreaction.\nB. Travel Time Display\nA particular type of driver information system that is\ngaining increasing momentum due to its relative simplicity\nand its popularity with drivers is the display (on VMS) of\ntravel times for well-defined stretches downstream of the\nVMS. This information is readily comprehensible by the\ndrivers, and it may either provide a basis for route choice\ndecisions or simply reduce the drivers\u2019 stress, particularly in\ncongested traffic conditions.\nFor example, some 350 VMS are installed on the Boule-\nvard P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique of Paris, France, and on all approaches\nthat lead to this ringway [115], [116]. The displayed mes-\nsage is the current (instantaneous) travel time on the ringway\nfrom the particular VMS location to two significant down-\nstream freeway intersections, at distances of approximately\n3 km and 6 km downstream from each VMS, respectively.\nA similar system, providing travel times on the two down-\nstream freeway links of each bifurcation node, is operational\n2058 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 91, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2003\nFig. 16. Example of a Variable Message Sign (VMS) display in\nthe Ile-de-France freeway network around Paris, France; this VMS\nis located just upstream of a freeway bifurcation whose outgoing\nlinks A1 and A3 eventually lead to the Boulevard P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique\n(BP). The sign informs (first line) that the current travel time from\nthe VMS on A1 until BP is 12 min with increasing tendency, while\n(second line) the travel time from the VMS on A3 until BP is\n21 min with decreasing tendency.\nin the dense freeway network around Paris; see Fig. 16 for an\nexample.\nThe calculation of instantaneous travel times for a freeway\nstretch including several inductive loop detectors is quite\nsimple. The stretch is subdivided into a number of seg-\nments with lengths ( m in Paris), whereby each\nsegment includes one detector station. A detector station\nmay either directly provide mean speed measurements or\nit may provide flow and occupancy measurements, from\nwhich the mean speed can be deduced with sufficient\naccuracy (see, e.g., [117], [118]). The travel time of\nsegment i is then given by\n(30)\nThe instantaneous travel time on a freeway stretch is de-\nfined to be the travel time of a virtual vehicle that travels\nthe stretch under the assumption that the currently prevailing\ntraffic conditions will not change during the trip. Based on\nthis definition and (30), the instantaneous travel time of\nthe whole freeway stretch, consisting of segments, may\nbe calculated from\n(31)\nThis formula works quite well in practice but it has\nsome drawbacks, notably if the mean speed in a segment\nbecomes temporarily very low, then (31) delivers an unre-\nalistically high travel time for the whole freeway stretch.\nAlternative formulas have been suggested and evaluated\nbased on real traffic data; see [119], [120].\nClearly, any instantaneous travel time formula based only\non current traffic measurements will induce a systematic esti-\nmation error if the traffic conditions in the stretch are rapidly\nchanging, e.g., during congestion growth or dissipation. This\nerror grows with the length of the stretch under question and\nmay, under certain conditions, reach unacceptable levels for\nfreeway stretches longer than, say, 10 km. What is needed in\nthis case is a predictive scheme that delivers predicted travel\ntimes that come closer to the travel times that will be experi-\nenced by the drivers during their trip. Predictive travel times\nmay be calculated:\n\u2022 based on historical information;\n\u2022 via suitable extrapolation methods (e.g., time se-\nries or neural networks);\n\u2022 by employment of dynamic traffic flow models\nin real time\n\u2022 via a combination of the above.\nThe technical literature addressing travel time estimation\nand prediction is quite vast; see, e.g., [121]\u2013[130], see also\n[131] for an empirical comparison of methods.\nC. Route Guidance Strategies\n1) Basic Notions: A route guidance system may be\nviewed as a traffic control system in the sense of Fig. 1.\nBased on real-time measurements, sufficiently interpreted\nand extended within the surveillance block, a control\nstrategy decides about the routes to be recommended (or\nthe information to be provided) to the road users. This, on\nits turn, has an impact on the traffic flow conditions in the\nnetwork, and this impact is reflected in the performance\nindices. Because of the real-time nature of the operation,\nrequirements of short computation times are relatively strict.\nRoute guidance strategies may be classified according to\nvarious aspects.\n\u2022 Reactive strategies are based only on and react\nto current measurements without the real-time\nuse of mathematical models or other predictive\ntools; predictive strategies attempt to predict traffic\nconditions sufficiently far in the future (typi-\ncally by real-time use of mathematical models)\nin order to improve the quality of the provided\nrecommendations.\n\u2022 Iterative strategies run several model simula-\ntions in real time, each time with suitably modified\nroute guidance, to ensure (at convergence) that the\ncontrol goal (see below) will be achieved as accu-\nrately as possible; iterative strategies are by nature\npredictive. One-shot strategies may either be reac-\ntive, in which case they typically perform simple\ncalculations based on real-time data, or they may\nbe predictive, whereby they run one single time a\nsimulation model to increase the relevance of their\nrecommendations.\n\u2022 Route guidance strategies may aim at either\nsystem optimal or user optimal traffic conditions.\nIn the first case, the control goal is the minimization\nof a global objective criterion (e.g., the total time\nspent) even for the price of recommending routes\nthat are sometimes more costly than the regular\nroutes. In the second case, every recommended\nroute should not be more costly than the regular\nroute, even for the price of suboptimality with\nrespect to the global objective criterion. Under\na more strict definition, user-optimal conditions\nimply equal cost on all utilized alternative routes\nconnecting any two nodes in the network.\n2) One-Shot Strategies: Most one-shot strategies are of\nthe reactive type. Particularly for dense networks, with\nrelatively short links, many bifurcations, and a high number\nof alternative routes connecting any two nodes, reactive\nstrategies may be highly efficient in establishing user-optimal\nPAPAGEORGIOU et al.: REVIEW OF ROAD TRAFFIC CONTROL STRATEGIES 2059\nconditions on the basis of current traffic measurements. This\nis because reactive routing recommendations in this kind\nof networks may be modified at downstream bifurcation\nnodes if traffic conditions change substantially.\nMost reactive strategies are decentralized, i.e., they\nconduct their calculations at each bifurcation node inde-\npendently of other nodes. Simple feedback regulators of\nthe P (proportional) or PI (proportional-integral) types have\nbeen proposed by Messmer and Papageorgiou [132]. A\nP-regulator calculates splitting rates as follows:\n(32)\nwhere is the portion of the flow arriving at\nbifurcation node n and destined to node j that is routed\nthrough the main direction at time k; is the nominal\nsplitting of drivers (in absence of route guidance); is a\nregulator parameter; is the instantaneous travel time\ndifference between the main and the alternative direction\nfrom node n to node j. Note that resulting from (32)\nis eventually truncated if it exceeds the range . The\nregulator (32) assigns more or less traffic to the alternative\ndirection according to the sign and value of the current travel\ntime difference among both directions thus aiming at\nequalizing both corresponding travel times, in accordance\nwith the user-optimum requirements. For K sufficiently\nhigh, an all-or-nothing (or bang-bang) strategy results from\n(32) whereby all vehicles are sent to the currently shortest\ndirection. It should be noted that these simple regulators\nare not very sensitive to varying compliance rates of drivers\n[133], [134]. An operational system employing decentralized\nP-regulators in the traffic network of Aalborg, Denmark,\nwas reported in [135], [136]. Multivariable regulators for\ncentral route guidance systems have also been suggested\n[137], [138], as well as heuristic or simplified feedback\nschemes [139]\u2013[142], and more advanced automatic control\nconcepts [143].\nA different kind of one-shot strategies may employ in\nreal time a more or less sophisticated mathematical model\nof the network traffic flow [144], [145]. Based on the\ncurrent traffic state, the current control inputs, and predicted\nfuture demands, the model is run once, in order to provide\ninformation about the future traffic conditions under the\ncurrent route guidance settings. A regulator is then used to\ncontrol the predicted future, rather than the current, traffic\nconditions. Such control schemes are known as IMC (In-\nternal Model Control) strategies in automatic control theory.\nThey are preferable to reactive regulators when the traffic\nnetwork has long links with a limited number of bifurcation\nnodes. A control scheme of this kind was applied to the\nScottish highway network employing P-regulators [146] or\na heuristic expert system [147], [148].\n3) Iterative Strategies: Iterative strategies may aim at\nestablishing either system-optimal or user-optimal condi-\ntions. For a system optimum, the pursued procedure has\nalready been outlined in Section III. A macroscopic network\ntraffic model may be written in the general form (27), where\nthe control inputs are the splitting rates . As already\nmentioned, macroscopic models describe the traffic flow\nas a fluid with particular characteristics via the aggregate\ntraffic variables traffic density, flow, and mean speed (see\nSection I-C). To enable the description of the routing\nbehavior, macroscopic models are extended to incorporate\npartial densities and partial flows by destination. Partial\nflows are assigned at bifurcation nodes to downstream links\naccording to the splitting rates which act as control\ninputs to be optimized. The corresponding optimal control\nproblem, aiming at minimizing the total time spent (29)\nunder the constraints may be solved by use of\nthe same numerical algorithms as the optimal ramp metering\nor the integrated control problem [132], [137], [149], see\nalso [150]\u2013[152].\nOn the other hand, there are also several iterative proce-\ndures suggested toward establishing user optimal conditions\n[153]\u2013[156]. The typical core structure of these iterative\nstrategies is as follows.\na) Set the initial path assignments or splitting rates (con-\ntrol inputs)\nb) Run a simulation model over a time horizon H.\nc) Evaluate the travel times on alternative utilized paths;\nif all travel time differences are sufficiently small, stop\nwith the final solution.\nd) Modify the path assignments or splitting rates appro-\npriately to reduce travel time differences; go to (b).\nThe simulation models employed by different algo-\nrithms in step (b) may be microscopic, macroscopic, or\nmesoscopic. Microscopic models address and describe the\nmovement of each individual vehicle in the traffic flow\nin dependence of the movement of the adjacent vehicles,\nboth in the longitudinal (car-following behavior) and in the\nlateral (lane-changing behavior) sense. Each vehicle has a\nprespecified destination and its path is decided pretrip or\nen-route according to the routing decisions of the algorithm.\nMacroscopic models may be expressed in the form (27) as\noutlined above. Mesoscopic models describe the evolution\nof mean speed macroscopically, but they also consider\nindividual vehicles (or \u201cvehicle packets\u201d) which, however,\nare moved in the network according to the macroscopic\nmean speed (without employment of microscopic models);\nthe traffic flows at section boundaries are deduced from\nindividual vehicle crossings, while traffic densities may be\nobtained directly from vehicle counts within a section. The\nreason why individual vehicles are introduced in mesoscopic\nmodels is in order to describe the routing behavior. Thus,\nas in microscopic models, each vehicle has a prespecified\ndestination, and its path is decided pretrip and en-route ac-\ncording to the routing decisions of step (d), without the need\nto introduce partial densities and flows as in macroscopic\nmodels [153]\u2013[155].\nThe modification of path assignments or splitting rates in\nstep (d) of the algorithm is typically effectuated in a function-\nally decentralized way, i.e., each splitting rate or path assign-\nment portion is changed independently of any other. The sign\nand magnitude of the individual changes depend on the sign\nand magnitude of the corresponding travel time differences,\nin a similar way as in (32), with the significant difference that\n2060 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 91, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2003\nFig. 17. Example network.\nFig. 18. Routing results for node N3 to destination D2: PI-regulator, (b) Iterative algorithm.\nthe travel time differences are here predictive [calculated in\nstep (c)] rather than instantaneous.\nThe real-time implementation of iterative algorithms for\nroute guidance purposes employs the same rolling horizon\nprocedure outlined in Section II-D in order to reduce the\nsensitivity with respect to predicted demands and modeling\ninaccuracies. No field implementation of an iterative route\nguidance procedure has been reported as yet (although some\nwork is in progress toward this end). Main reasons for this\nare the relatively recent interest in RGDIS, but certainly also\nthe code complexity of the corresponding algorithms.\n4) An Example: Fig. 17 displays a hypothetical freeway\nnetwork consisting of 29 nodes (N1-N29) and 51 links,\nthereof nine origin links (O1\u2013O9), eight destination links\n(D1\u2013D8), and 34 freeway links (L1\u2013L34). Freeway link\nlengths range from 1 km to 4 km. Splitting for route guid-\nance is considered at nodes N2, N3, N8, N14, N20, N24\ntoward the destinations D1 and D2, which results in a total\nnumber of 11 splitting rates since N20 is connected to\nD1 via one direction only. Note that the number of possible\npaths is much higher. The network traffic flow is simulated\nmacroscopically with appropriate demands at the network\norigins.\nFig. 18 displays a representative example of routing\nresults. Each diagram displays three histograms relating to\na specific (node, destination)-couple : the splitting rate\nand two relative travel time differences (instantaneous\nand predictive). The latter are defined as , where\nwas defined in (32) and is the travel time from\nn to j along the main direction. The control goal (user\noptimum) is to keep so long as\nis not on the bounds 0 or 1, i.e., so long as a splitting\nactually takes place. Fig. 18(a) displays the results obtained\nby use of simple PI-regulators while Fig. 18(b) displays\nthe corresponding results from an iterative algorithm (after\n100 iterations). These results give rise to the following\ncomments.\n1) Instantaneous and predictive travel time differences\nare not far from each other, the former typically lag-\nging the latter; this may be different in case of net-\nPAPAGEORGIOU et al.: REVIEW OF ROAD TRAFFIC CONTROL STRATEGIES 2061\nworks with few bifurcations and very long links, as\nmentioned earlier.\n2) The simple PI-regulator manages to keep travel time\ndifferences fairly low; note that, as (32) indicates, such\na regulator is based merely on instantaneous travel\ntimes at each period k, which can be readily estimated\nbased on real-time measurements.\n3) The iterative algorithm leads to virtually full satis-\nfaction of user-optimum conditions (i.e.,\n) albeit based on perfect knowledge of future de-\nmands, driver compliance, and traffic flow dynamics;\nin real applications, prediction mistakes are inevitable,\nleading to clearly less impressive results.\nV. FUTURE DIRECTIONS\nA. The Theory\u2013Practice Gap\nAs in many other engineering disciplines, only a small\nportion of the significant methodological advancements have\nreally been exploited in the field as of yet. It is beyond\nthe scope of this review paper to investigate and discuss\nin depth the reasons behind this theory\u2013practice gap, but\nadministrative inertia; little competitive pressure in the public\nsector; industrial interest in (expensive) hardware rather than\nin (low-cost) methodologies; the complexity of traffic control\nsystems; limited realization of the improvement potential\nbehind advanced methods by the responsible authorities;\nand limited understanding of practical problems by some\nresearchers may have a role in this. Whatever the reasons,\nthe major challenge in the coming decade is the deployment\nof advanced and efficient traffic control strategies in the\nfield, with particular focus on addressing traffic saturation\nphenomena (congestion).\nMore precisely, the majority of small and big cities even\nin industrialized countries are still operating old-fashioned\nfixed-time signal control strategies, often even poorly opti-\nmized or maintained. Even when modern traffic-responsive\ncontrol systems are installed in terms of hardware devices,\nthe employed control strategies are sometimes na\u00efve, poorly\ntested and fine-tuned, thus failing to exploit the possibilities\nprovided by the relatively expensive hardware infrastructure.\nRegarding freeway networks, the situation is even worse.\nOperational control systems of any kind are the exception\nrather than the rule. With regard to ramp metering, the main\nfocus is often not on improving efficiency but on secondary\nobjectives of different kinds. Many responsible traffic au-\nthorities and decision makers are far from realizing the fact\nthat advanced real-time ramp metering systems (employing\noptimal control algorithms) have the potential of changing\ndramatically the traffic conditions on today\u2019s heavily con-\ngested (hence strongly underutilized) freeways with spectac-\nular improvements that may reach 50% reduction of the total\ntime spent.\nWith regard to driver information and route guidance sys-\ntems, there is an increasing interest and an increasing number\nof operational systems employing variable message signs,\nbut once more, the relatively expensive hardware infrastruc-\nture is not exploited to the degree possible, as implemented\ncontrol strategies are typically na\u00efve.\nOn the side of the research community, any effort should\nbe made to enlighten the road authorities, the political\ndecision makers, and the general public about the substantial\nimprovements achievable via implementation of modern\ntraffic control methods and tools. At the same time, it should\nbe emphasized that many methodological works presented\nat conferences and technical journals address practical\nproblems and concerns only in a limited way. In some cases,\nproposed traffic control strategies are not even thoroughly\nand properly tested via simulation, despite the meanwhile\nhigh number of available traffic simulators of various kinds.\nThis poses a burden to real implementation of the methods,\nand perhaps the best way for researchers to familiarize\nthemselves with the practical requirements and constraints\nis to get occasionally involved in real implementations.\nB. Road Traffic Control Strategies\nThe number of developed signal control strategies is much\nhigher than what could be included or mentioned in Sec-\ntion III. The need and trend is clearly toward traffic-respon-\nsive coordinated strategies. Two avenues may be identified\nas promising in this respect.\n1) Advanced signal control strategies, such as OPAC,\nPRODYN, CRONOS, and RHODES, have clear\nlimitations regarding the network extent, to which\ntheir basic optimization algorithm can be directly\napplied. The properties of a completely decentralized\noperation (e.g., independent algorithm application at\neach intersection) are currently not fully analyzed\nor understood. This kind of thorough analysis may\nbe useful for enhanced network-wide coordinating\nlayers that reduce the possibly negative impact of\ndecentralization.\n2) Store-and-forward based concepts seem, more than\nthree decades after their original conception, to offer\na promising background for the development of\nsignal control strategies that are traffic-responsive,\ncoordinated (for large-scale networks), and can cope,\nunder certain conditions, with oversaturation and the\nimminent inaccuracies of traffic measurements in an\nurban road environment. In addition, this approach\nseems ideal for the design of (even more challenging)\nintegrated traffic control strategies involving further\ntraffic systems (freeways) and control measures.\nC. Freeway Traffic Control Strategies\nWith regard to ramp metering, the most important\nmethodological developments are well advanced, although\nfurther improvements are desirable and possible both at\nthe reactive and the network-wide levels, as well as at the\ninterconnection of both levels. The most promising and\nchallenging area for control strategies is the design and\ntesting of hierarchical control structures for very large-scale\n2062 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 91, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2003\nfreeway networks. Control hierarchies should include\nshort-term demand predictions, optimal control algorithms\nfor the coordinated calculation of set values network-wide,\nand reactive feedback strategies for implementation of the\noptimal control decisions. Besides efficiency, the equity\nproperties of ramp metering strategies are of particular\nimportance in ubiquitous network-wide ramp metering\nsystems.\nThe integrated control of freeway networks involving both\nramp metering and route guidance measures is currently in a\nvery preliminary phase with some very promising results, but\na lot more developments are required to produce integrated\ncontrol strategies that are efficient, but also applicable in real\ntime to large-scale networks.\nFinally link control systems may prove much more useful\nthan at present if their impact is studied more carefully and\nthoroughly so as to open the way to the design of efficient\ncontrol strategies. This is perhaps one of the least studied\nareas within traffic control methodology.\nD. Driver Information and Route Guidance Systems\nAlthough the subject of DRGIS is relatively new, a\nsubstantial amount of work has been devoted to it and a\nnumber of methods and tools have already emerged, but fur-\nther developments, either completely new or combinations\nof already suggested methods, are possible and desirable.\nOne-shot methods appear particularly attractive for real-time\napplications because they are simple, with negligible com-\nputational effort. More experience is required regarding their\nefficiency level and the topological and traffic conditions\nthat are most suitable for their application. On the other\nhand, the surplus efficiency provided by iterative approaches\nshould be further investigated, and possible combinations\n(e.g., in order to reduce the computational effort of iterative\nstrategies) should be attempted.\nE. A Potential Limitation\nAny substantial improvements achieved in the field thanks\nto beneficial application of control methods, may be coun-\ntered to some extent due to latent (induced) demand, i.e., due\nto drivers motivated to use their cars (rather than other trans-\nportation means) or to drive through efficiently traffic-con-\ntrolled areas so as to profit by the reduced travel times.\nAlthough the precise nature and extent of this medium-term\ndriver response to beneficial control measures has not been\nstudied sufficiently, we may note the following.\n\u2022 In the worst case, the originally achieved im-\nprovements of travel time due to control measures\nwill be only partially reduced due to latent de-\nmand, because full erasure of the improvement\nwould provide no motivation for latent demand to\nappear.\n\u2022 A partial (rather than full) improvement of travel\ntimes (due to latent demand) addresses a higher ben-\nefitting driver population (that includes the latent\ndemand).\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.
