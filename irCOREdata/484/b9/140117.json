Regular introductions of new products\ncan be essential, especially in fast-moving markets. But how often do companies\nintroduce new products? A database of UK manufacturing plants was analysed to\ndetermine the innovation rates and typical product development times in specific\nindustry sectors. The results show a wide spread in the development times and\ninnovation rates even within closely defined sectors\u2014this implies that some\ncompanies are particularly efficient at product innovation whereas others need to\nimprove in this area. In addition, the research identifies a number of key areas of\ninnovation which require further investigation, both within the UK and on an\ninternational basis.\nKEYWORDS\nProduct innovation, new product development, cycle times, UK manufacturing\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Anglo-German Foundation,\nwho funded the research described in this paper.\nINTRODUCTION\n3The speed and the frequency with which new products can be developed are\nfundamental issues and consequently they have become a focus for management\nattention over the last few years. Reflecting the importance of the business issues\ninvolved, there has been a substantial stream of research investigating the topic faster\nand more frequent product innovation. However, many questions remain to be\nanswered. For instance, how often do companies typically introduce new products?\nHow long does it typically take them? And, are there major differences between\ndifferent industries? These were the background questions which initiated the\nexploratory research on product innovation described in this paper.\nWithout frequent new products, companies can quickly lose competitiveness\nand market share\u2014\u201cif you do not innovate, old products will be overtaken by new\ntechnology\u201d [1]. A recent survey of European manufacturing managers identified that\nthe ability to introduce new products was one of the key challenges now facing\nEuropean companies [2]. Companies that have recognised this are responding; many\nare talking about the importance of innovation and several have launched major\ninnovation initiatives. For example, an executive from the German company Siemens\nrecently stated, \u201cAny intelligent corporate strategy must have innovation at its very\nheart\u201d [3]. Other companies which are also launching projects to promote more\ninnovation include Renault, Philips, Ericson, BT and BASF [4]; and 3M [5].\nInnovation is a topical management issue: as one executive from 3M has said \u201ctoday,\nthe idea of innovation is widely accepted... in 1994 and 1995, around 275\n[management] books published in the United States had the word innovation in their\ntitles\u201d[6].\nThe time required to develop and introduce a new product\u2014variously referred\nto as time-to-market or cycle time\u2014is a key performance measure which is often\n4targeted by companies for improvement. This is because \u201ctime to market is widely\nviewed as a key source of competitive advantage, particularly in fast-cycle industries\u201d\n[7]. Increased competition is forcing companies to concentrate on developing and\nsuccessfully introducing new products faster [8]. The importance of reducing cycle\ntime has been highly stressed: \u201cin the highly competitive environment of the nineties,\ntime to market with new products can make or break companies\u201d [9].\nThis article considers both cycle time and the rate of new product\nintroductions\u2014as an indication of innovation\u2014in British manufacturing industry.\nAlthough fast new product development is recognised as crucial, comparatively little\ndata has been published which identifies the typical cycle times in various industries.\nThis information is potentially valuable, as it would give companies a benchmark; a\ncomparison against which they can measure their own performance. Similarly, data on\nthe numbers of new products introduced over time by companies in different sectors is\nlimited. To address this gap, this study measures cycle times and innovation rates. The\naims of the research were:\n1) To investigate cycle times and innovation rates of companies in various sectors of\nUK manufacturing industry and determine whether there is a large amount of\nvariation within an industrial sector.\n2) To investigate whether product complexity affects cycle time within a sector.\nINNOVATION AND NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\nInnovation: Its Importance, Management and Measurement\n\u201cInnovation is the principal engine of economic growth\u201d [10]. New products are the\nfundamental part of innovation in manufacturing industry and are a key source of\ncompetitive advantage [11]. As competition increases in many markets, companies\n5must relentlessly develop innovative new products if they are to be successful [4].\nRecognising this, many companies are attempting to introduce more new products,\nhowever, the success rate for new products is considered by observers to be very low\n[12].\nManaging innovation may prove difficult and the question has even been\nasked \u201cto what extent can product innovation be planned?\u201d [13]. A key problem is the\nwide range of factors which influence the success or failure of new products,\nincluding the allocation of resources, the skill of key staff, the generation of ideas and\nthe organisation of development teams (ibid). Gobeli and Brown [14] identified the\ntypical problems that companies face with managing product innovation. Problems\nexist at every stage of product innovation; from the creation of ideas, to the choice of\nthe best ideas, to product development, to the introduction of products onto the\nmarket. Therefore, companies face a difficult task in trying to stimulate more efficient\ninnovation.\nOne widely publicised approach by the 3M company has been the use of strict\nfinancial measures to highlight the importance of product innovation and stimulate the\ndevelopment of more new products. One goal used by 3M is that 30% of revenues\nmust be generated by products less than four years old [15]. However, managing\ninnovation is difficult because it is not necessarily a logical process [16], and despite\nthe constant stream of publications on innovation, it is far from clear how companies\ncan best become more innovative. It is certainly not as clear cut as one author who\nclaimed; \u201cthere is no doubt that properly managed innovation can bring industry the\nsolutions which it needs and help it to achieve a competitive edge\u201d [17].\nData on companies\u2019 innovation rates is rarely published. Although companies\nsuch as Hewlett-Packard and 3M publish the amount of revenue which has been\n6generated by new products in their annual reports, few other direct indications are\navailable. Rare data on innovation rates can be found in economic research by Acs\n[11], who measured the innovations related to million employees in an industry and\nfound that small companies are more innovative than large ones. In addition, \u201cthere\nare considerable differences in innovation rates across industries\u201d (ibid). However, it\nshould be noted that this investigation concentrated on the industry level and used data\nfrom 1982, as more recent data was not available.\nEconomists have long studied innovation because of the links to economic\ngrowth. However, they have normally studied it at a macro-level and this has\nacknowledged limitations; \u201cwhen we look at technological change in the aggregate...\nwe are obviously forced to simplify an enormously complicated set of activities\u201d [18].\nIn addition, measuring innovative activity is difficult as has been pointed out by\nGeroski [19] who stated: \u201cstudies of the causes and consequences of innovative\nactivity have often been stymied by the difficulty of measuring \u2018innovation\u2019\u201d. Various\nmeasures of innovation have been used by economists such as R&D expenditures, or\nthe number of major innovations generated in an industry over time but innovation at\nthe product level has been largely ignored.\nIt appears that previous researchers have not looked in detail at innovation\nrates\u2014measured as the percentage of product portfolios that are renewed per year\u2014at\nindividual companies within an industry and so this topic was chosen as for\ninvestigation.\nThe Importance of Fast New Product Development\nMuch has been published on the need for companies to develop new products faster\nthan their competitors. It is becoming increasingly important for companies to focus\n7on reducing cycle time [7]. Fast new product development (NPD) is one of the key\nthemes of Time Based Competition, which was largely promoted through the work of\nStalk [20] and has been a key focus in manufacturing industry since the end of the\n1980s.\nFast cycle time is given credit in the business press with two main advantages.\nIf the product which is introduced is a totally new concept, then being first-to-market\nenables a company to define key market requirements and establish itself before\ncompetitors enter the market. In established markets, introducing new products faster\ngives real competitive advantage, because products which reach the market sooner are\ncredited with increased profit and market share [20]. One example of the advantages\nof faster NPD are figures from printer development projects at the Hewlett-Packard\nCompany [21]. These show that high-technology products which come out six months\nlate will earn 33% less profit over a five-year period. These figures have been widely\nquoted as evidence that faster cycle time leads to higher profits, without any real\nconsideration of their (doubtful) external validity. It can be stated that, although the\nadvantages of short cycle times appear clear in the business literature, they are not\nbacked by clear, unequivocal evidence.\nFor instance, in a comprehensive study of the chemicals industry, Cooper and\nKleinschmidt [22] found that the link between fast cycle time and profitability was\nweak. Similarly, Ellis and Curtis [23] showed that fast R&D in isolation does not lead\nto effective innovation. Faster NPD does not appear empirically to be directly\ncorrelated to higher sales either [24] and \u201cit is futile to expect large profit gains from\nshortening cycle time\u201d [23]. In fact it appears that cycle time reductions should only\nbe pursued if the technical and organisational foundations of NPD are improved at the\nsame time [25]. However, other researchers found that faster cycle time (measured at\n8the volume production stage) did affect market share positively, provided the lead\nover competitors was above a minimum threshold level [7].\nTechniques for Faster NPD?\nAfter faster NPD became recognised at the end of the 1980s as a pertinent goal for\ncompanies, there followed a wave of prescriptive articles on the ways in which it\ncould be achieved (see, for example; [26],[27],[28]). Many of these were based on\nanecdotal evidence from specific development projects which have questionable\nexternal validity. The widespread acceptance of anecdotal evidence allowed claims to\nbe made that certain techniques would reduce cycle time significantly. Unfortunately,\n\u201cmost prescriptions for cycle time reduction are based on little hard evidence\u201d [29].\nFor example, one technique which was hailed as a major advance in reducing\ncycle time was Quality Function Deployment (QFD)\u2014a Japanese method for ensuring\nthat customer requirements are accurately captured. Griffin [30] has clearly shown this\nbelief to be flawed. Another technique which has been prescribed as the way to\naccelerate new product development is concurrent engineering (CE), in which all\nfunctional areas commence work on NPD simultaneously. However, CE can be\ndifficult to apply ([31],[32]), and may involve some trade-offs [33]. Another study\nshowed \u201cno significant relationship was found between the use of concurrent\nengineering and financial performance\u201d [23].\nFaster NPD cannot be achieved simply by applying specific techniques.\nBroader\norganisational aspects also need to be considered ([24],[34],[35],[36]). In addition the\nskills and motivation of the people working on innovation is crucial [37], as is their\ncommitment to fast cycle time [38]. It is important not only to accelerate NPD;\n9Cooper [39] has noted that choosing the right projects from the start and managing\nthem appropriately is key [40].\nIn conclusion, it can be said that there is a wide range of techniques for faster\nNPD but that the use of any of these will not, in itself, guarantee reduced cycle times.\nBringing products to market faster is just not that simple\u2014the situation and the way\ntechniques are implemented plays a key role ([41],[42]).\nNew Product Development Measures\nWhich measures are necessary to the understanding of NPD? Griffin [43], identified\nthat a fundamental problem of research into techniques which reduce cycle times was\n\u201cthere were no baseline measures from which to form comparisons\u201d and demonstrated\nthe importance of establishing accurate and comprehensive NPD metrics. Ellis and\nCurtis [23], showed that few companies capture accurately the time from idea to\nmarket and this type of measurement is essential because, without it, valid\ncomparisons are impossible.\nGriffin\u2019s work recommends that metrics for NPD should be comprehensive\nand cover the characteristics of the project (inputs); the process of NPD itself; and the\noutcomes [43]. One of the metrics, cycle time, was identified as particularly prone to\nmeasurement error\u2014because companies measure development times differently and\noften do not keep accurate records of the starting dates of projects. An approach is\nrecommended which counteracts these problems. However, a limitation of this\napproach is that it requires extensive interviewing of managers to accurately determine\nall of the NPD metrics and this has limited the application of the ideas, to-date, to a\nsample to 21 divisions from 11 companies (across five industries). Griffin has also\n10\nanalysed the relationships between cycle times, product complexity and other factors\n[44].\nThe majority of cycle times which have been published stem from individual\nprojects and (probably) suffer from measurement accuracy problems. Griffin ([44]\nsummarises previously published cycle times from 21 companies and then gives\nempirical data summarising 343 projects at eleven companies. Toepfer [26] lists 8\ncycle times (four of which are from the same sources as [44]). Another estimate of\ncycle times comes from a survey (189 companies in the Product Development and\nManagement Association) from which Page [45] concluded that \u201cit takes the average\ncompany 2.95 years to develop more innovative types of new products\u201d and \u201cover a\nrecent five-year period, the companies introduced an average of 37.5 new products,\nwhereas the median was twelve\u201d. A survey by the consultants Pittliglio Rabin Todd &\nMcGrath (PRTM) [46] showed that automotive and industrial companies were setting\nthemselves the goal of reducing cycle times by 14%, whereas electronics companies\nwere aiming for a 23% reduction. However, the published version of this survey failed\nto identify the actual values of the cycle time in different sectors.\nIt can be seen that published data on cycle times is sparse and some of it is\npossibly unreliable. As Griffin concluded; \u201cone unexplored research issue is how long\nproduct development actually takes\u201d [44].\nRESEARCH DESIGN\nThe principal aim of this research was to obtain values for innovation rates and NPD\ncycle times from a wide range of companies across different industrial sectors.\nConsequently, it was decided to include new product development and innovation as\npart of a wider, ongoing investigation of the performance of UK manufacturing\n11\nindustry. A research programme was initiated in 1992, based on a highly-publicised\nannual competition to identify and reward excellence in UK manufacturing industry\u2014\nthe Best Factory Awards (BFA).\nThe BFA programme is run by Management Today (a leading UK monthly\nmanagement magazine) and Cranfield School of Management. The programme\nrecognises manufacturing excellence and collects detailed information from industry\nfor research and bench-marking purposes. The annual awards are open to any\nmanufacturer with a UK-based plant which completes a detailed 14 page, confidential\nquestionnaire covering performance data (e.g. delivery reliability), the products\nproduced, management policies, etc. Questionnaires are analysed and this results in a\nshort-list of manufacturing plants which have high performance relative to the\n\u201cnorms\u201d of their industry. A panel of judges visits short-listed companies, verifies the\nperformance data, probes managers on their manufacturing strategy and checks issues\nsuch as the active participation of employees in quality management. Each year seven\ncategories of prizes are awarded; the selection process itself has been described\nelsewhere in more detail [47].\nA key point to note about the BFA programme is that, over the last five years,\nover 1200 companies have entered the competition and so the questionnaire is well-\ntested. In addition, the quality of the data is believed to be very high\u2014entrants know\nthat they may receive a visit where the values they give in their answers will be\nchecked. Therefore, there is strong indirect pressure to answer accurately and\nhonestly. In addition since the programme was initiated, the judges have visited 74\nplants (6% of the total) and verified data integrity for these plants. The BFA database\nhas previously been used for a number of empirical studies, which typically have\ncombined analysis of the data with in-depth case studies of companies from the\n12\ndatabase. Examples include an investigation of factory performance [47] and new data\non supplier management [48].\nOne of the sections of the BFA questionnaire looks directly at innovation\u2014\ncollecting information on NPD cycle time, plus current and (estimated) future\ninnovation. The relevant questions from the BFA questionnaire are given in the\nAppendix. In designing the overall questionnaire, an appropriate compromise had to\nbe made between the number and depth of questions being asked and the maximum\ntime that respondents\u2019 companies are willing to invest to answer the questions. The\nresult is a detailed questionnaire which captures comprehensive performance data but\nwhich requires significant resources and effort to be invested on the part of respondent\ncompanies. Many companies comment that much of the data required is not readily\navailable within their companies (but that completing the questionnaire is a positive, if\ntime consuming, learning experience for management). As the questionnaire was\nalready long, the scope of the questions on innovation and NPD which could\nrealistically be asked was limited and a strong focus was required. This led to the\ninclusion of three questions, which capture the following values:\n\uf0b7 Cycle time (defined as \u201cfrom start of detail design to market launch\u201d)\n\uf0b7 The number of new products launched over the last five years (and the number of\nthese which were product line extensions and which were totally new)\n\uf0b7 The number of new products expected to be launched in the next five years\nEach of the questions was carefully designed and extensively piloted before being\nincluded. As an introduction to the questions, text explains what is meant by\nsignificantly new products (refer to the Appendix).\nThe remainder of the questionnaire covers a wide range of manufacturing\nperformance measures, from lead-times to inventory profile. Background information\n13\non products allows companies to be classified by Standard Industry Codes (SIC). The\nemphasis throughout the questionnaire is on collecting objective and unambiguous\ndata. Several questions provide useful points on which to compare the data on\ninnovation. These are the number of products manufactured by a plant (can be used to\nestimate the innovation rate, using the data on the number of product launches) and\nthe product complexity.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA total of 649 plants entered the BFA programme between 1993 and 1995, coming\nfrom a wide range of industries including the electronics, engineering, process and\nhousehold products sectors. A range of plant sizes was represented; 163 (25%)\nmanufacturing plants were small businesses and employed less than 500 employees.\nOwnership of the plants was as follows: UK owned (42%); UK owned small\nbusinesses (22%); UK joint owned (5%); US owned (14%); Japanese owned (2%);\nEuropean owned (10%); and (other) foreign owned (5%). Although the sample cannot\nbe claimed to be fully representative of UK manufacturing industry, because the\ncompanies are self-selecting, the quantity, quality and depth of data means that the\ndatabase is still an important research tool.\nIt would have been possible to calculate mean cycle times and innovation rates\nacross the whole sample, similar to the approach taken by Page [45]. However, it was\nfelt that this approach would be wrong\u2014it would compare values across very different\nsectors and the resulting average values would be of little value. Therefore, the sample\nfor the actual analysis was focused on five closely defined sectors where sufficient\ndata existed for meaningful comparisons (i.e. sectors in which there were more than\n25). The five sectors where sufficient data was available were the Intermediate and\n14\nGeneral Engineering; Electronics; Electronic Components; Chemicals and Food,\nDrink and Tobacco. These five sectors contained data from a total of 340 companies.\n(Due to missing data, certain tables contain less than this number of data points.)\nCycle Time\nTable 1 shows the results of the analysis of the cycle times for the sample companies,\nby industrial sector. It can be seen that the mean cycle time in the Intermediate and\nGeneral Engineering sector is 16 months, for Electronics 16.8 months, etc. Analysis\nof variance was used to test whether the differences between cycle times in different\nsectors are significant. This analysis showed that only the Food, Drinks and Tobacco\nsector has cycle times that are significantly different from the other four sectors (F\nratio = 6.1780; F probability = .0001).\nOf particular interest are the large standard deviations, for instance, 10.7\nmonths for engineering. Large standard deviations are seen in all five sectors,\nindicating a large spread of cycle times within sectors. This is an interesting result as it\nillustrates the danger of quoting only average values for a sector (i.e. the approach\ntaken by Page [45] is probably best avoided). There are several possible explanations\nfor the wide range of values. One is that the companies within any particular sector\ndevelop products of significantly different complexity (and this leads to different cycle\ntimes). This possibility was investigated by analysing the cycle time data versus the\nproduct complexity.\nInsert Table 1\nCycle Time versus Product Complexity\n15\nIt would seem intuitively clear that more complex products would take longer to\ndevelop. Therefore, a check was made to see if there was any correlation between the\ncycle time and product complexity. Defining product complexity is difficult\u2014there is\nnot a simple proxy measure for it. Griffin [44] used the number of product features but\nthis approach could lead to problems of interpretation, especially within a survey\nformat. Therefore, as a measure of complexity, the number of different components,\npurchased items or assemblies in the product with the largest output (at manufacturing\ncost) was taken; this was termed the \u201cproduct part complexity\u201d.\nTable 2 shows the results of an analysis on the effect of product complexity on\ncycle time in each sector. It can be seen that the correlations are weak and not\nsignificant. Therefore, the differences in cycle times are not simply explained by\ndifferences in product parts complexity. More investigation is needed to establish the\nreasons for the widely varying cycle times within sectors.\nInsert Table 2\nInnovation Rates by Sector\nInnovation rate was operationalised by taking the number of new products introduced\nover the previous five years, expressed as a percentage of the total product range.\nTherefore, from Table 3 it can be seen that the median innovation rate for engineering\nwas 1.8% but the top quartile of engineering companies had an innovation rate of\n9.6%. It is interesting to note from Table 3 that the innovation rates for the top\nquartiles of companies in any of the five sectors are much higher than the median\nvalues. This indicates that some companies appear to be much more effective at\nintroducing new products than other companies in the same sector; this indicates that\n16\n\u201cbest practices\u201d may play a role. (Note that the survey did not attempt to measure the\nsuccess of new products.)\nInsert Table 3\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe research gave a rare insight into the cycle times and innovation rates at a\nrelatively large number of companies in five sectors of UK manufacturing industry.\nThe results were interesting because, despite being obtained from narrowly defined\nsectors, they exhibited surprisingly large variations, in both cycle times and innovation\nrates. This suggests significant differences in innovation performance between\ncompanies operating in very similar markets and shows that average values for\ninnovation measures should be used with caution.\nThe weak correlations between product complexity and cycle time may\nindicate that some companies are efficient at developing complex products faster than\ntheir competitors. However, as the proxy measure for complexity had its limitations,\nmore investigation is needed before a conclusion can be reached on this.\nThe survey approach used in this investigation was exploratory and had some\nlimitations. Firstly, only a few questions could be asked and, secondly, the questions\nmay not have been, for some respondents, totally unambiguous. However, it collected\ndata points from more companies than has previously been the case. The next stage of\nthe research will need to look closer at the reasons behind the differences in\ninnovation performance. The unit of analysis for this investigation will need to be the\nindividual plant. As part of the BFA programme, the researchers can normally obtain\naccess to respondent companies for in-depth further investigations and therefore the\n17\nopportunity exists to study the companies in a sector or sectors further. The areas on\nwhich this type of research needs to focus are:\n\uf0b7 Collecting further empirical data on cycle times and innovation rates in companies\nin different sectors. Verifying the survey data through follow-up interviews.\n\uf0b7 Investigating the relationship between high innovation rates and market\nperformance. Are the companies which regularly introduce new products achieving\nmarket growth and higher profit levels?\n\uf0b7 How is innovation managed at the companies which develop new products faster?\nCan best practices be identified and how do these compare to the techniques for\nfaster NPD that have received wide acclaim in the business press?\n\uf0b7 Developing an appropriate methodology to accurately investigate the way\ncompanies manage their product innovation.\nJust as innovation is a challenge for managers in industry, it offers many key\nchallenges to management researchers\u2014particularly in trying to identify best practices\nwhich have wider relevance and apply not only in the context of one project.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Anglo-German Foundation\nwho are funding a project investigating innovation management at manufacturing\ncompanies in Germany and the UK. The research described in this paper forms the\nfirst part of this project.\n18\nAPPENDIX\nSection F of the Best Factory Awards questionnaire includes the questions on\ninnovation and product development given below.\nF: PRODUCT INNOVATION\nA significantly new product is one which the plant has not made previously and which\nrepresents more than a simple change of material, colour or design variant.

However, if the trouser manufacturer\nstarted making overcoats this would be regarded as significant for the plant.\nF1 How long does it typically take to bring a significant\nproduct innovation to market (from start of detail\ndesign to market launch)?\nmonths\nF2.
