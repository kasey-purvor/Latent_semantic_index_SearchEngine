Introduction\nRupture propagation during earthquakes along convergent\nmargins may commonly be confined to discrete along-strike\nstructural segments. However, it is recognised that rupture\npropagation across such segment boundaries can result in\nmegathrust earthquakes of considerable destructive power that\nmay generate transoceanic tsunami. The control on earthquake\npropagation exerted by segment boundaries is well established\n(Spence, 1977; Ando, 1975) but the physical causes are poorly\nunderstood. As a result we cannot fully determine seismic and\ntsunami hazard along convergent margins globally. Several51\n52\n53\n\u204e Corresponding author.

A large-scale structure\nnear Simeulue Island (Fig. 1) has been suggested as a control on\nthe ruptures, but its specific nature is unknown. Singh et al.\n(2005) and Kamesh Raju et al. (2007) propose an upper plate\ncontrol on the segment boundary with the West Andaman Fault\nas a key structure controlling rupture propagation. DeShon et al.\n(2005) propose that the boundary of the southern Andaman\nmicroplate, in the vicinity of Simeulue Island is a diffuse\ndeformation zone, and that this developing plate boundary\nserved as a barrier to rupture propagation. Dewey et al. (2007)\npropose a lower plate control, suggesting that a distortion of the\nplate interface at depth beneath the forearc may be the cause.\nMore specifically, Subarya et al. (2006) suggest that a boundary\nhas formed due to distortion of the plate interface, related to a\nnorth\u2013south trending fracture zone on the incoming oceanic\nplate.\nThe aim of this study, therefore, is to characterize the plate\ninterface and structural architecture in the vicinity of the\nsegment boundary between the December 26th 2004 and March\n28th 2005 mainshocks.

Tectonic setting\n8Along the convergent margin off Sumatra the oceanic Indo-\n8Australian Plate subducts under the Eurasian Plate (Fig. 1). As\n8the former plate moves northward, convergence becomes\n8increasingly oblique from south to north. In the vicinity of the\n8December 2004 epicentre the azimuth of convergence is N10\u00b0E\n8at 4\u00b0N, 95\u00b0E, (Delescluse and Chamot-Rooke, 2007). The result\n8is large-scale strain partitioning with trench-normal and trench-\n8parallel shear components. Along the leading edge of the\n9Eurasian Plate, the trench-parallel shear results in large-scale,\n9dextral strike-slip fault systems within the forearc basins and on\n9Sumatra.

Northwest\nof the re-entrant a change in morphology and structure of both\nthe accretionary prism and the oceanic plate takes place. To the\nnorthwest, the Sumatra deformation front continues as a salient,\nwith its apex offset ~150 km to the west (Henstock et al., 2006;\nFig. 1). The outboard slope of the accretionary prism is a\npronounced feature with steep gradients of approximately 4\u00b0 to\n8\u00b0 passing from 4500 m at the base to 1500 m at the top, where\nit forms an irregular plateau with water depths as shallow as\n200 m. There is no distinct outer arc high. The accretionary\nprism is 140 km wide with a structural trend generally parallel to\nthe margin (Sibuet et al., 2007). At the re-entrant the\narchitecture of the March 2005 rupture segment, is remarkably\ndifferent to that in the north. The width of the accretionary prism\ndecreases to 100 km (from the deformation front to the West\nAndaman fault), the wide plateau seen in the north disappears,\nand the more usual tapered form of an accretionary prism is\npresent. There is an outer arc high on which are located a chain\nof small islands, of which Simeulue is the most northerly (Fig.\n1).

Wide-angle\/refraction seismics\nTo obtain reliable velocity and structural information on the\ndeeper section of the accretionary wedge we acquired wide-\nangle\/refraction seismic data along two MCS profiles; BGR06-\n208a and BGR06-135 (Fig. 1). Line BGR06-208a is situated\nsouthwest of Simeulue Island. It is parallel to the trench and at a\nmean distance of about 34\u00b12 km from the toe of the\naccretionary prism. Along this line, ten ocean-bottom hydro-\nphones\/seismometers were deployed with a mean separation of\n15 km (Fig. 1). 1763 shots were fired at intervals of about\n106 m, resulting in a total length of profile of 186 km. The wide-\nangle seismic instruments recorded energy from an offset range\nof at least \u221260 to 60 km (see Fig. 2 and Supplements 1 and 2 in\nAppendix A). At all 10 stations we recorded well defined\nrefracted waves from within the sedimentary column (Pg) of the\naccretionary prism as well as clear wide-angle reflections of the\nsubducting oceanic crust (PcP).\nWe constructed velocity\u2013depth models by applying a tomo-\ngraphic method\u2014 tomo2d, (Korenaga et al., 2000) which inverts\ntraveltimes from both refracted and reflected waves.

The inversion was run\nin two steps. Firstly, inversion of the refracted waves through the\nsedimentary column provided a detailed velocity\u2013depth model of\nthe upper 6 to 8 km below sealevel. Between these depths the\nrefracted waves, calculated as diving waves, reached their turning\npoint and travelled back to the surface. Secondly, the traveltimes\nfor reflected waves were calculated. The results provide both the\nseismic velocities between the well-constrained upper sedimen-\ntary section and the top of the oceanic crust at a depth of about 12\nto 16 km together with the depth and profile of the oceanic crust.\nThe top oceanic crust reflection is shown in Fig. 3 only for those\nregions where there is a good coverage of seismic rays, where the\nlocation of crust is well constrained.\nThe RMS misfit of the PcP phases is in the range of accuracy\nby which the traveltimes of the PcP phases could be picked.\nThis misfit is less than 100 ms and gives an error in the depth\ndetermination of the oceanic crust reflector of less than 300 m.\nThe traveltimes of the Pg-phases are better resolved than those\nfrom the PcP, with a misfit of less than 40 ms. From these results\nwe consider the velocity model and depth to the oceanic crust to\nbe well defined.\nTo confirm that the structures imaged are within the spatial\nresolution of the data, we performed checkerboard tests\n(Supplement 3 in Appendix A). The final velocity model, as\nobtained by the tomography, was tested with superimposed\nvelocity anomalies of systematically decreasing size.

If the perturbed model can be reproduced by the\n1tomography the size of the velocity anomalies are within the\n1vertical and horizontal resolution of the data. In this way we are\n1able to resolve velocity variations with a dimension of less than\n120\u00d78 km. At the southeastern end of line BGR06-208a, the top\n1oceanic crust reflector is more than 3 km deeper than in the\n1centre of the profile (Fig. 3). The deeper location of the top\n1oceanic crust reflector was found over a distance of 40 km, i.e.\n1twice the horizontal resolution of better than 20 km. This proves\n1that the depth change identified is not a velocity artefact caused\n1by variations in the overlying sedimentary sequence. In fact\n1there is a uniform velocity structure in the sediments resting on\n1the subducting oceanic crust (Fig. 3). A constant depth for the\n1subducting oceanic crust would only be possible if there was a\n1distinct, and very large, low velocity zone (i.e. a very strong\n1velocity inversion) in the sediments above the section where we\n1identify the deeper oceanic crust (profile km 0\u201370). Such an\n1inversion is not possible.\n1To address the question of velocity\u2013depth ambiguity, we\n1systematically varied the depth kernel weighting parameter\n1(Korenaga et al., 2000). The final velocity model shown in Fig. 3\n1was calculated with a weighting parameter of unity, which\n1corresponds to equal weighting of velocity and depth nodes.\n1Decreasing the weighting parameter should lead to smaller depth\n1variations with larger velocity variations.

We recorded at a total of 31 ocean-bottom stations.\nDue to higher ships speed a shooting interval of 60 s resulted in\nan average shot spacing of about 120 m. Here we only\nconcentrate on the western, seaward, part of the line and use\ntraveltimes of refracted waves from 13 stations to derive the\nvelocity\u2013depth model. PcP phases from 5 stations constrain\nvelocities at greater depth down to the subducting oceanic crust.\nWe used a similar modelling procedure for this wide-angle\/\nrefraction line as for line BGR06-208a. The resulting model\nprovides seismic velocities for the trench fill and for the\naccretionary prism up to 60 km landward of the prism toe. The\nprism sediments have values of 4.0 km\/s at a depth of 3 km\nbelow seafloor, and reach a value of 5.5 km\/s at about 13 km\nbelow seafloor.\nThe results from the two wide-angle\/refraction seismic lines\nprovided an initial velocity model for the depth migration of the\nMCS lines (Section 3.2). Reflections beneath the top oceanic\ncrust were recorded only occasionally in the wide-angle data.\nThus the deeper parts of the velocity model are based mainly on\nextrapolation and, therefore, are tentative. In the MCS\nprocessing, in order to avoid any migration artefacts, we\nsmoothed these velocity models in the crustal area with a\nvertical window of 3 km. Thus there are minor differences\nbetween the wide-angle and the MCS velocity models.\n3.2. Multichannel reflection seismics (MCS)\nDuring our marine surveys over the 2004 and 2005 rupture\nzones a comprehensive dataset of some 9000 line kilometres of\nMCS data were acquired together with gravity and magnetics\ndata. MCS data were acquired with a 240 channel, 3 km\nstreamer (offset to near group: 150 m; maximum offset:\n3,137.5 m), and a tuned airgun array comprising 16 airguns\nwith a total capacity of 50.8 L. Record length was 14 s with a\nsample interval of 2 ms. A shot interval of 50 m resulted in a\nfold of 30.\nProcessing of four MCS lines was performed up to full\nKirchhoff prestack-depth migration and included the production\nand correction via MVA (migration velocity analysis) of a depth\nvelocity model. After testing various combinations of processing\nparameters the following sequence was regarded as optimal.\nPrestack processing included geometry editing, deconvolution,\ntrue amplitude recovery, and filtering. Reduction of water-bottom\nmultiples (a major challenge) was achieved by applying a\nparabolic radon filter and inner trace mutes. Stacking velocities,\nat an average distance interval of 3 km, were determined for the\nreference poststack time migrated sections. The initial depth\nmodel was derived from the wide-angle\/refraction seismic data\nalong the lines BGR06-135 and BGR06-208a and from\nsmoothed DMO velocities, adjusted and calibrated at the cross\npoint with the refraction seismic line for lines BGR06-117 and\n-119. The upper parts of the velocity fields were iteratively\nimproved via MVA until the migrated CRP gathers were flat.\nQuality control included a detailed evaluation of congruence\nbetween the poststack migrated sections and the time-converted\nprestack-depth migrated sections.

Finally, time and space variant signal\nfiltering, time varying scaling and, along some sections, a\nsmooth fx-deconvolution completed the poststack processing\nsequence.\n3.3. Bathymetry\nSwath bathymetry was acquired by the RV Sonne using a\n12 kHz Simrad EM 120 and by the HMS Scott using 12 kHz\nSASS-IV system (Henstock et al., 2006, Ladage et al., 2006).\nThe swath data was compiled and merged to provide a complete\nmap of the area off northern Sumatra (Figs. 1 and 6).\nInterpretations of the swath bathymetry were integrated with\ngeodetic data to provide an overall picture of the structure of the\nboundary between the 2004\/2005 earthquakes located in the\nvicinity of Simeulue Island.\n4. Results\n4.1. Image of the plate interface\nThe margin-parallel line BGR06-208a (Fig. 3) crosses the\nboundary between the two earthquake ruptures of 2004 and\n2005 in the vicinity of Simeulue Island. It lies 34\u00b12 km\nlandward of the deformation front. From the wide-angle seismic\ndata the velocity\u2013depth model resolves the top oceanic crust\nbetween line kilometres 15 and 140 (Fig. 3\u2014 top). Only at the\nmargins is the ray coverage insufficient to image the reflection.\nThe oceanic crust is subhorizontal at a depth of about 12 km\nalong the central part of the line. To the southeast over a\ndistance of 40 km the ocean crust depth gradually increases in\ndepth by more than 3 km (Fig. 3 \u2014 top; profile km 60\u201320;\nsouth of 2\u00b0N). Since the velocities of the overlying, accreted\nsediments are uniform along the line the depth change is not an\nartefact due to velocity pull-down.\nThe MCS data provides complementary insights into the finer\ndetail of the sedimentary prism, together with the crustal structure\nthan available from the wide-angle seismic data. Reflections of\nthe sedimentary prism and the underlying oceanic crust allow\nrefinement of the coarse interpretations based on the refraction\nresults. Conversely, the refraction models provide a constraint on\ninterpretations of the MCS (Mooney and Brocher, 1987).\nOn the MCS data, the profile of the subducting oceanic crust is\nseen to be broadly similar to that on the wide-angle seismics\n(Fig. 3\u2014 bottom). However, there are distinct regions of strongly\nreflective oceanic crust alternating with regions of weaker\nreflections. In the centre of the line (Fig. 3 \u2014 bottom; profile km\n70\u2013120) the strongly reflective top of the oceanic crust lies\ncontinuously at a shallowdepth of 11 to 12 km.To the northwest the\nstrongly reflective oceanic crust dips slightly from about 11 km to\n12.5 km depth (Fig. 3 \u2014 bottom; profile km 120 to 160). The\noceanic crust reflection is not imaged at the northwestern end of the\nline where the initial velocity model for depth migration is poorly\ncontrolled.es \u2014 Imaging the boundary between the ruptures of the great 2004 and 2005\nUNCORRECTED PROOF\nFig. 4. Three prestack-depth migrated multichannel seismic lines crossing the accretionary prism west and south of Simeulue Island (BGR06-117, -119, -135) show that the variations in the topography of the oceanic\ncrust coincide with a change in the structural style of the accretionary wedge and that the intersection of the dip lines with the margin-parallel line is 34\u00b12 km landward of the toe of the accretionary prism. Relative panel\nalignment is along the margin-parallel line BGR06-208a (Fig. 3). The locations of the profiles are indicated as thick purple lines in Fig. 1. The northern line BGR06-117 (A) is in the December 2004 segment. In the trench\nthe gentle dipping oceanic crust is covered by a thick sedimentary pile (N4 km) and the accretionary prism has a steep outboard slope. The line in the centre BGR06-119 (B) also has a gently dipping oceanic crust beneath\nthe frontal accretionary prism but mainly exhibits a structural high in the oceanic crust beneath the trench. The top of the oceanic crust is 7 km deep in the west and at about 7.8 km beneath the slope. The southern line\nBGR06-135 (C) bisects the broad re-entrant along the Sunda Arc. The trench fill is strongly wedge-shaped, thickening from 1 km to 4 km at the deformation front. The dip of the oceanic plate increases and thrusts in the\naccretionary prism form steeply dipping, seaward verging, antiformal stacked slices.

Franke et al. \/ Earth and Planetary Science Letters xx (2008) xxx\u2013xxx\nARTICLE IN PRESSUN\nCO\nRR\nEC\nSoutheast of 2\u00b0N (Fig. 3\u2014 bottom; profile km 70) there are\nno MCS reflections from the top of the oceanic crust for some\n20 km. This absence of reflections is where, on the wide-angle\nseismic data, there is a gradual increase in depth of the oceanic\ncrust. Further south at km 45 on the MCS line, the oceanic crust\nreappears as a weak, discontinuous reflection about 2 km deeper\nthan in the central part of profile. The change in reflectivity is\nnot due to any change in the character of the overlying sedi-\nments because these can be traced across this region.\nIn the region traversed by the seismic line the deformation\nfront is slightly curved because it is located in the broad re-\nentrant region between Nias and Simeulue islands. However,\nthe change in the depth of the oceanic crust cannot be attributed\nto an oblique relationship between the orientation of the seismic\nline and the deformation front. Even if there was some limited\nobliquity between the orientation of the seismic line and the dip\nof the slab, given an average dip of the oceanic crust of about 5\u00b0\nan offstrike distance of 2 km either up or down the slab would\nresult in a depth change of the top oceanic crust of less than\n200 m.\nFrom both seismic datasets we can identify an increase in depth\nalong the strike of the oceanic crust of between 2 km (MCS) and\n3 km (wide-angle data). Due to the MCS streamer length of\n3000 m, absolute oceanic crust depth values are probably better\nresolved from the wide-angle seismic data. The observed\nvariations in slab depth are due to a prominent structural relief in\nthe lower plate. The location of the change in slab depth coincides\nwith the segment boundary outlined by the aftershock distribution\n(Ammon, 2006). The depth change is limited to a 40 km wide\nregion of the lower plate at approximately 2\u00b0N and 96\u00b0E.\n4.2. Structural architecture and domains along the margin\nSouthwest of Simeulue, towards the trench, we acquired\nMCS data along three dip lines that cross the accretionary\nprism. These lines are shown in Fig. 4 arranged relatively to the\nline-ties with BGR06-208a.\nProfile BGR06-117 (Fig. 4A) is located in the southern\nregion of the December 2004 earthquake rupture. The line\nextends for some 72 km across the trench and accretionary\nprism at the northwestern tip of the re-entrant. Along the line the\ntrench fill is more than 4 km (3.4 s TWT) thick and at the seabed\ncompletely levels out the oceanic crust relief. The fill consists of\ncontinuous parallel to sub-parallel reflections cut by palaeo-\nchannels. The seismic character is typical of turbidite facies. A\nseries of conjugate normal faults cuts the entire trench fill. The\noceanic crust can be traced beneath the frontal accretionary\nprism. It dips at about 4\u00b0. At the tie-point with line BGR06-\n208a, some 34 km northeast of the toe of the accretionary prism,\nthe oceanic crust is at a depth of ~12.5 km. Almost all the\nsedimentary cover on the incoming plate is offscraped and\ndeformed at the prism toe. Thus almost all incoming sediment is\naccreted to the frontal prism. Within 12 km of the prism toe\nthere is a doubling of the sediment thickness resting on the\nsubducting plate. This increase in sediment thickness results in\nan extraordinarily steep prism slope of 15\u00b0. The increase in\nthickness is accompanied by frontal collapse structures.Please cite this article as: Franke, D., et al., The great Sumatra\u2013Andaman earthquak\nearthquakes, Earth Planet. Sci.

At the southwest end of the line, the top of the oceanic\ncrust is at 7 km depth. Beneath the prism toe this depth increases\nto about 8 km (Fig. 4B). Oceanic crust depths are considerably\nshallower (~2 km) than on line BGR06-117 (Fig. 4A). Along\nline BGR06-119 the oceanic crust entering the subduction zone\nshows a similar normal fault pattern to that on line BGR06-117.\nHowever, the trench fill is only 2 km thick and slightly more\nwedge-shaped as it passes towards the accretionary prism.\nNormal faults penetrate the trench fill but heal upwards. Above\na 500 m elevated graben shoulder in the oceanic crust a popup\nstructure delineates the youngest outboard deformation. Again,\nthere is frontal accretion of almost the whole trench fill at the\nprism toe, thus the incoming sediments are basally detached.\nHowever, the resulting frontal toe of the accretionary wedge is\nbroader than further north and not as steeply dipping. The\noceanic crust dips gently beneath the trench at the toe but the dip\nincreases beneath the slope. About 32 km from the toe of the\nprism it reaches a depth of ~11.5 km at the line-tie with line\nBGR06-208a. Here the oceanic crust dips of ~6\u00b0.\nMCS line BGR06-135 runs from SW to NE from the oceanic\nplate to the eastern part of the Simeulue Basin (Fig. 4C). It is\nlocated in the northern region of the March 2005 rupture. The\nprofile lies at the apex of the broad re-entrant located off of\nSimeulue and Nias Island. The trench fill is strongly wedge-\nshaped, thickening from 1 km in the southwest to 4 km at the\ndeformation front. Again, the trench fill and oceanic crust are\nnormally faulted. In the lower section of the accretionary prism\nthere is imbricate thrusting of the accreted sediment similar in\nstyle to that on line BGR06-119 and also seen further south\n(Schl\u00fcter et al., 2002; Susilohadi et al., 2005). The oceanic crust\nreflection is discontinuous but can be traced for more than\n70 km to the northeast of the deformation front (Fig. 4C). There\nis an increase in depth of the oceanic crust from 9 km at the\ndeformation front to ~13 km at the line-tie with line BGR06-\n208a. This corresponds to a slab dip of 6.7\u00b0 beneath the frontal\naccretionary prism.\nComparing the three cross-profiles we establish an increase\nin slab dip from the north (4\u00b0) to the south (6.7\u00b0) beneath the\nfrontal prism slope. This trend is accompanied by decreasing\nseabed slope angle of the frontal accretionary prism. Large\nseabed slope angles in the north coincide with the accretion of a\nthick sedimentary column whereas the thinner incoming\nsedimentary pile south of Simeulue Island corresponds with\nlower slope angles.\n5. Discussion\n5.1. Origin of slab relief\nThe simplest hypothesis to explain the shallow depth oceanic\nslab north of 2\u00b0 identified on our data, would be a broad rise on\nthe lower plate created as the Indo-Australian Plate is subducted\nbeneath the 300 km long re-entrant.

We conclude, therefore, that the\nnarrow width and steep marginal dips of the shallow slab\nreflection cannot be explained by a broad rise on the slab that\nhas formed by broad-scale subduction beneath the re-entrant.\nRather, the data support the subduction of an elongated, narrow\nhigh on the subducting plate.\nFor the origin of the narrow high we refer to the Indo-\nAustralian Plate offshore of Sumatra, the structure of which is\nreasonably well established (Cande et al., 1989; Deplus et al.,\n1998; Milsom, 2005; Delescluse and Chamot-Rooke, 2007).\nDominant structures on the plate are E\u2013W trending extinct\nspreading ridges, or N\u2013S trending fracture zones. However, on\nthe oceanic plate off Simeulue Island along strike from the feature\nwe identify, neither spreading ridges nor fracture zones are\nevident on our high-resolution bathymetry nor on satellite\naltimetry (Smith and Sandwell, 1997). Further south, where the\nsedimentary cover thins, several fracture zones are imaged on\ngravity and magnetic data and the satellite altimetry (Smith and\nSandwell, 1997). Morphologically, these fracture zones appear as\ncomplex structures of alternating topographic highs and lows\n(Ladage et al., 2006). Their width (30\u201350 km) and relief (~500\u2013\n2000m) are of same order ofmagnitude as the rise observed in our\nseismic data south of Simeulue. The Investigator Fracture Zone,\nwhich trends approximately north\u2013south at 98\u00b0E, has an\nestimated elevation of up to 2000 m (Milsom, 2005).\nNorth of the re-entrant, at 93.2\u00b0E and 93.6\u00b0E, Sibuet et al.\n(2007) propose that north\u2013south oriented tectonic lineaments\non the incoming plate are related to palaeo-fracture zones. These\nauthors suggest that these fracture zones have been subducted\nand are influencing upper plate deformation, being reactivated\nwith left-lateral slip during the December 2004 mainshock.\nAnother fracture zone, further south of those identified by\nSibuet et al. (2007), can also be mapped from magnetic anomaly\npatterns (Cande et al., 1989; Barckhausen, 2006) and traced into\nthe area off Simeulue. A fracture zone at this location was also\ninferred by Newcomb and McCann (1987). It projects almost\nexactly onto the location of the elevated oceanic crust we\nidentify along line BGR06-208a (Fig. 3). In conclusion, we\nsuggest that it is this fracture zone, now deeply buried beneath\ntrench sediment, that is the source of the shallow flat slab we\nidentify on line BGR06-208a.\n5.2. Orientation of shallow slab\/fracture zone\nThe question remains, what is the orientation of the shallow\nslab, and does this support a fracture zone origin? Fig. 3 shows a\nslightly NW dipping oceanic crust reflection in the NW part of\nline BGR06-208a. As this is at the edge of the velocity\u2013depth\nmodel, the increase in depth of the oceanic crust to the NW is\nnot well constrained. However, in this region, but further to the\nsouthwest on line BGR06-118 (Fig. 5 \u2014 top) we observe a\nsimilar depth trend in the oceanic crust seaward of the\naccretionary prism. Seismic line BGR06-118 is about 60 km\nSWof the prism toe and oriented parallel to the trench as well as\nto line BGR06-208a. The top of the oceanic crust is well imaged\nand dips to the NW, as on line BGR06-208a.

Its relief at seabed is masked by the drape of\nthe trench fill sediments. A line connecting the relief in the\noceanic crust identified along line BGR06-118 with the increase\nin depth of the oceanic crust to the NW along the margin-\nparallel line BGR06-208a would strike NNE.\nTurning to composite line BGR06-121\/122 (Fig. 5 \u2014\nbottom). This line is margin parallel and located between the toe\nof the accretionary prism and line BGR06-208a. At the cross tie\nbetween lines BGR06-119 and BGR06-121\/122 the oceanic\ncrust is at a depth of 7.8 s (TWT). At the southern end of\nBGR06-121\/122, about 70 km to the south, it is at 9.0 s (TWT)\n(Fig. 5, bottom). The sedimentary thickness is 4 s (TWT) at the\nnorthwestern end of the line whereas it is up to 5 s (TWT) in the\nsoutheast. Although the seabed relief is more irregular in the\nnorthwest (smoother in the southeast) the water depths on\naverage remain the same along the line. However, although the\ntop oceanic crust reflection is clearly imaged at both ends of the\nline, between km 25 and 58 it disappears. Both locations are\nabout 20 km landward of the toe of the accretionary prism. In\nthe SE part of the profile the back limb of an anticline is imaged\nshowing smooth topography and subhorizontal strata. It is\ntherefore surprising that the highly reflective top oceanic crust\nreflection becomes weak to absent northeast of km 58, where it\nstill underlies the subhorizontal strata (Fig. 5 \u2014 bottom).\nWe consider the absence of the reflection to be attributable to\nthe same cause as on line BGR06-208a. Allowing for the\ndifference in sediment thickness along line BGR06-121\/122,\nthat would result in a velocity pull-up in the southeast, in the\nsoutheast the oceanic crust reflection is about 2.5 km deeper\nthan in the northwest. A line connecting the locations of weak\noceanic crust reflections as well as the increase in depth from\ncomposite line BGR06-121\/122 and line BGR06-208a would\nstrike NNE towards Simeulue (Fig. 6 \u2014 top).\n5.3. Links between lower and upper plates\nGPS measurements on Simeulue Island (Subarya et al.,\n2006, Briggs et al., 2006) reveal vertical uplift in the north\nduring the earthquake of December 2004 and uplift in the south\nof the island during the March 2005 event. The differential\nuplift defines a saddle in the middle of the island. It is taken as\nevidence for a major basement structure that may control\nrupture termination and a segment boundary (Briggs et al.,\n2006). Projecting the trend of the slab rise (fracture zone) on our\nseismic data onto Simeulue Island reveals a close alignment\nwith the saddle identified by Briggs et al. (2006), with a trend of\nNNE\u2013SSW (~N10\u00b0). The proposed NNE trend identified on\nour data also projects onto the nucleation point of the December\n2004 earthquake (Fig. 6 \u2014 top). Consideration of the uplift on\nSimeulue in the context of our interpretations of an increase in\ndepth of the oceanic crust seen in our wide-angle\/refraction and\nMCS data may reflect a common cause.\nRelative plate convergence between the Indo-Australian and\nEurasian plates is parallel to the general trend of the strike of the\nextinct fracture zones (Subarya et al., 2006; Simons et al.,\n2007).

Franke et al. \/ Earth and Planetary Science Letters xx (2008) xxx\u2013xxx\nARTICLE IN PRESSUNmillion years (Hall, 2002; Delescluse and Chamot-Rooke,2007) the location of the collision between an N\u2013S orientedfracture zone and the convergent margin has remainedstationary. This coincidence between the relative plate vector\nand the strike of the extinct fracture zones results in the\ndeformation of the upper plate during subduction of the fracture\nzone ridge remaining stationary also. It is surmised that such\ndeformation over an extended time period would produce a\nsignificant structural change in the over-riding plate, such as a\nmajor tectonic boundary. There appears to be no large-scale\nevidence of this structural change on Simeulue Island, nor on\nthe accretionary prism.

Previously, the orientation of the segment\nboundary was inferred to be orthogonal to the plate boundary\n(Newcomb and McCann, 1987; Ammon et al., 2005; Bilham,\n2005). In this regard the aftershock distribution is ambiguous\nbut, however, in terms of orientation of the segment boundary,\ndoes not discount an alternative trend of NNE\u2013SSW (Fig. 6).\n5.4. Simeulue segment boundary\nFracture zones and other structural discontinuities on the\ndowngoing plate are first-order candidates for the initiation of\nsegmentation and earthquake rupture termination between the\n2004 and 2005 earthquakes (e.g. Subarya et al., 2006). Our data\nlends support to this interpretation. The shallow slab we identify\nis 60 km wide and elevated for about 1 km towards the NWand\nfor some 3 km towards the SE. As an extinct fracture zone, it is\ncomparable in width and height, to the Investigator Ridge,\nanother N\u2013S trending fracture zone on the Indo-Australian\nPlate. Located further south, the Investigator Ridge, where it\ncollides with the accretionary wedge at 89\u00b0E, 2.5\u00b0S, has a width\nof 30\u201350 km and an elevation of about 1 km. Perhaps\nsignificantly, the collision zone of this feature correlates with\nthe boundary between the 1797 and 1833 great earthquakes\n(northern end) and the 1861 great earthquake (southern end)\noffshore of southern Sumatra (Fauzi et al., 1996; Sieh and\nNatawidjaja, 2000; Rivera et al., 2002).\nA particular feature of the Simeulue fracture zone that may\ncontribute to its effect on margin segmentation is its size and\nasymmetry. The relief of the fracture zone is far greater than that\nof the other prominent fracture zones and ridges (including the\nInvestigator Ridge) on the Indo-Australian plate. The eastern\nflank of the ridge off Simeulue is at 3 km high much higher than\nthe western flank. This height is twice that of the Investigator\nRidge.\nThis relief across a fracture zone could be a function of the\njuxtaposition of crust of significantly different ages. The general\nage of the oceanic crust, however, is Eocene and, assuming\nsymmetrical spreading, there is an age difference of ~2Ma (Cande\net al., 1989). The resulting seafloor depth differencewill, therefore,\nbe only of the order of 100\u2013200m, a difference that cannot account\nfor the overall relief observed across the fracture zone.\nAlternatively a fault or tear at the eastern flank of the proposed\nfracture zone could explain the depth difference of 3 km we\nobserve. Modelling the wide-angle seismic data reveals that the\ntop of the subducting oceanic crust gradually increases in depth\n(Fig. 3 \u2014 top). However, the spatial resolution is limited due to\nthe layout of the wide-angle seismic experiment and the\nmodelling algorithm used. An abrupt depth change like a steep\nramp or tear would also be resolved as smooth transition with this\nacquisition configuration.\nThe interpretation of this feature as a fault or tear is\nsupported by the MCS data. These show weak and discontin-\nuous reflections on both margin-parallel lines BGR06-208a and\nBGR06-122 east of the topographic high of the proposed\nfracture zone (Figs. 3 and 5). This reflection character would not\nbe expected if it were merely a gradual change in slab depth.Please cite this article as: Franke, D., et al., The great Sumatra\u2013Andaman earthquak\nearthquakes, Earth Planet.

Close to the trench these are additionally reactivated as\nnormal faults caused by flexural bending of the oceanic plate as it\ndescends into the subduction zone (Schauer et al., 2006;\nGraindorge et al., 2007). The fracture zone off of Simeulue we\nconsider to be similarly reactivated and dip-slipmovements along\nthe eastern flank have resulted in the observed step in the oceanic\nslab. Faulting along the eastern edge of this fracture zone possibly\npenetrates the entire oceanic slab. The result could be a tear in the\nsubducting plate as slab dip increases beneath the accretionary\nprism. This may be an answer, as to why the Simeulue fracture\nzone is such a prominent barrier to rupture propagation.\n6. Conclusions\nInterpretation of a suite of marine geophysical data including\nwide-angle seismic and multichannel reflection seismic reveals a\nridge on the subducting oceanic crust, entering the accretionary\nwedge off Sumatra located at 95.6\u00b0E, 2\u00b0N. The western flank of\nthe ridge is about 1 km high whereas the eastern flank is up to\n3 km. Trench sediments up to 5 km in thickness mask the\ntopographic relief of the oceanic crust so that the ridge is not\nvisible on the bathymetric data. The ridge is about 60 kmwide and\nstrikes in NNE\u2013SSW direction. It extends beneath the accre-\ntionary wedge and likely also beneath Simeulue Island.\nThe projection of the ridge beneath the accretionary wedge\nand further under the forearc basins plots onto the common\nsegment boundary of the 2004 and 2005 mainshocks. This\nrelationship implies a structural control of the downgoing ridge\non the segment boundary between the huge ruptures of the\nDecember 2004 and the March 2005 earthquakes. The trend of\nthe ridge is parallel to fracture zones on the Indo-Australian\nplate and we consider such a fracture zone, buried by thick\nsediments as likely origin of the ridge.\nThe ridge on the oceanic crust contributes to or is a major\ncontrol on the initiation of the segment boundary. The step in\nthe slab across the eastern flank of the proposed ridge\/fracture\nzone could be the result of either a gradual, oblique ramp or a\nshallow slab tear. However, the gradual depth change of 3 km as\nderived by wide-angle\/refraction seismic data coincides with a\nsignificant change in the reflectivity of the oceanic crust\nreflection in the multichannel seismic data. We consider that this\nmay reflect a dissected and faulted subducting oceanic crust.\nDip-slip movements along the eastern flank of the subducting\nfracture zone beneath Simeulue may be considered as\nintensification factor in terms of rupture propagation barrier.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are indebted to the Government of Indonesia (BPPT) as\nIndonesian partner providing the permission for the investiga-\ntions in its territorial water.
