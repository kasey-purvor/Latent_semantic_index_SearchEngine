INTRODUCTION \nnSAR is an established technique that allows the estimation \nof elevation from the phase difference between two \noverlapping images acquired from slightly different sensor \npositions [1]. InSAR sensors record the phase and the \namplitude of the backscatter return, with the difference in \nphase between the two images being related to the difference \nin path length to a point and therefore its location. \nPolarimetric data is sensitive to the orientation of the elements \nwithin a pixel and may be recorded at co-polarized HH \n(horizontal transmit, horizontal receive), VV (vertical \ntransmit, vertical receive) and cross-polarized HV or VH \npolarizations (transmitted in one orientation, received in the \nother). Fully polarimetric data sets, where HH, HV, VV and \nVH polarizations are recorded, enable more information about \nthe scattering processes to be determined, particularly through \npolarimetric decomposition [2]-[4].  \n \nManuscript received October 18, 2006.

Balzter was with the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology Monks Wood, \nHuntingdon, Cambridgeshire, PE28 2LS, UK. He is now with the Department \nof Geography, University of Leicester, Bennett Building, University Road, \nLeicester, LE1 7RH, UK (email: hb91@leicester.ac.uk).  \nIncorporating polarimetric data into SAR interferometry \nenables information on the scattering processes and their \nheight to be determined. Applications of polarimetric SAR \ninterferometry (PolInSAR) have focused on forested areas, but \nhave also explored the potential for PolInSAR analysis over \nagricultural and urban areas [5], [6] and snow [7]. Forest \nheight mapping is the most developed PolInSAR application \narea with work focusing primarily on model development and \nmodel inversion to yield canopy height, topography and \ncanopy extinction rates [8]-[10]. The more independent \nobservations used to invert these simplified models, the better \nthe resulting estimate of canopy height becomes, with multiple \npolarizations, multiple baselines or multiple wavelengths all \nvaluable additional sources of information [11], [12]. \nEstimates of canopy height from radar and airborne laser \nscanner data can be derived in a number of ways. One method \nis to use a digital surface model (DSM) to map the height of \nthe top of the canopy and a digital terrain model (DTM) to \ngive the height of the underlying terrain. The difference \nbetween the DSM and DTM provides the estimate of canopy \nheight. This approach has been successfully applied to dual \nwavelength InSAR data [13], [14] and LiDAR discrete-return \ndata for a deciduous woodland [15]. The accuracy of the \nheight estimates is dependent upon the accuracy of the DSM \nmap of canopy height, which depends mainly upon the degree \nof signal penetration, and the accuracy of the DTM, which \nmaybe poor, especially under dense canopies.  \nIn cases where a suitable DTM can not be derived from \navailable remote sensing data existing topographic maps have \nproved useful, in conjunction with InSAR derived large-scale \nDSM\u2019s [16], [17]. Large-scale InSAR DSM\u2019s are now \navailable, with the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission \n(SRTM) product, which was flown in February 2000, \nmapping 80% of the Earth\u2019s land surface with a C-band \n(5.6cm) InSAR to produce an almost global DSM at ~30m (1 \narc second) resolution in the US and ~90m (3 arc seconds) \nI \nTGRS-2006-00646 \n \n2\nresolution elsewhere [18]. Airborne InSAR systems are also \nbeing used to generate large-scale DSM products, notably \nNEXTMAP produced by Intermap with their X-band (~3cm) \nStar-3i system [19]. \nThe generation of DTM\u2019s from DSM\u2019s is problematic in \nregions with forest or urban land cover, as the influence of \ntree canopy and buildings needs to be removed or minimized \nto avoid contaminating the DTM. A number of methods have \nbeen investigated to derive DTM\u2019s from InSAR DSM\u2019s, with \n[20] investigating rules for the automatic generation of DTM \nin urban areas. Whilst ground height estimates are produced \nby inversion of some InSAR canopy models they have not \ngenerally been exposed to the rigorous validation applied to \nthe canopy height products [8]-[11]. Creation of DTM\u2019s under \nforest canopies has been mainly the preserve of the airborne \nlaser scanning community (for example [21]-[24]). Data \nfusion methods are beginning to be explored for the \nimprovement of InSAR and LiDAR DTM\u2019s, such as using the \ninterferometric coherence to identify areas where an InSAR \nDTM performs poorly and filling those gaps with elevation \nfrom a stereoscopic SAR DTM [25]. Multi-spectral and \nLiDAR have been successfully combined to produce a \nsophisticated method of building detection to enable more \naccurate generation of urban DTM\u2019s from LiDAR data sets \n[26]. \nPolInSAR data sets comprise a number of parameters, \nincluding polarization, wavelength, interferometric phase, \ninterferometric coherence, backscatter intensity and spatial (or \ntextural) information. In many applications only a single \nparameter out of this family is exploited. This paper proposes \na method for incorporating ancillary data sets into the \ngeneration of InSAR DTM\u2019s for areas under forest canopies \nand assesses the utility of various data sets for identifying \nground pixels. We define a ground pixel as a pixel where the \nprimary influence on the interferometric phase is the ground \nand hence where the pixel can be identified by the dominance \nof surface scattering in the InSAR signal. The method is tested \nat a temperate, semi-natural deciduous wood.  \nThis paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the \nstudy site and data sets, and is followed by Section III which \noutlines the DTM production method, while Section IV covers \nthe validation method. Section V presents the results and is \nfollowed by the discussion and conclusions in Sections VI and \nVII respectively. In this paper we use the following \ndefinitions: The DTM is the elevation of the terrain, including \nterrain underlying vegetation or urban areas. The DSM is the \n\u2018raw\u2019 elevation product from the sensor in question and \nincludes the height of vegetation albeit with some \nunderestimation due to signal penetration into the canopy. \nII. STUDY SITE AND DATA SETS \nA. Study site \nMonks Wood (52\u00b024'N, 0\u00b014'E) is a semi-natural deciduous \nwoodland located in south-east England, UK and covers \n157ha. The principal overstorey species are ash, maple and \noak, with main understorey species including hawthorn, hazel \nand blackthorn. The maximum tree height is around 26m and \nthe mean tree height is about 12m. Terrain elevation varies \nfrom 6m to 46m, with a maximum slope angle of 14.5\u00b0 [27]. \nCanopy cover varies from completely open along rides and \ntwo fields, within the woodland perimeter, to completely \nclosed. The wood is divided into stands, by rides and paths \nthrough the wood, but the stands are heterogeneous in terms \nof overstorey and understorey density, tree age distribution \nand species composition. \n \nB. InSAR data and processing \nA fully polarimetric L-band InSAR data set of Monks \nWood was acquired by the airborne E-SAR sensor on 1st June \n2000. The L-band (23cm wavelength; 1.3 GHz) data were \nrepeat-pass with a temporal baseline of 13 minutes and a \nhorizontal and vertical baseline of approximately 10m and \n0.4m respectively. The flight altitude was roughly 3km \nproducing a ground range pixel size of 1.49m in the range \ndirection and 0.85m in the azimuth direction. The data were \nmulti-looked during the interferometric processing by 2 and 4 \nlooks in the range and azimuth directions correspondingly. \nThe InSAR processing produced a data set with a vertical \naccuracy of around 2m (e.g. L-HH root mean square elevation \nerror of 1.95m against 14 bare ground control points). The \nincidence angle range across the wood is 39\u00ba \u2013 54\u00ba. All InSAR \nraster data products were geocorrected to enable comparison \nwith georeferenced theodolite and LiDAR data sets.  \nThe fully polarimetric nature of the SAR interferometry \ndata set enabled the three optimized coherence channels to be \nderived in addition to the L-HH, L-HV and L-VV \npolarizations based on the method developed by [8]. The \nmethod involves determining the optimum scattering \nmechanisms in polarimetric SAR interferometry data by \nmaximizing the interferometric coherence. Twinned with a \ncoherent decomposition algorithm it allows separation of the \nscattering phase centre heights for the optimum scattering \nmechanisms, resulting in three pairs of scattering mechanisms \n[8].  \nIn the optimized coherence polarization basis the first \nsingular value (\u03c51) has the highest coherence and therefore \ntypically contains the highest proportion of surface scatter. \nThe third singular value (\u03c53) has the lowest coherence and as \nsuch generally represents volume scattering, or a combination \nof volume scattering and surface scattering [28]. The \ncoherence for the second singular value (\u03c52) is an intermediate \nstage and is likely to feature a higher level of canopy \nscattering than \u03c51 [28]. \n \nC.  Theodolite data \nA set of reference theodolite data, containing terrain \nelevation measurements at 244 points, were collected in June \n2000 using a Pentax R-125N electronic total station (laser \ntheodolite). The x, y and z co-ordinates of each point were \nTGRS-2006-00646 \n \n3\ncalculated in relation to a permanent Ordnance Survey \nbenchmark located at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology \n(CEH) Monks Wood research station. The terrain elevation \npoints comprised of 140 measurements under the canopy, with \nthe remaining 104 in open areas of the wood [15]. \n \nD. LiDAR-derived DTM and canopy height model \nOn 10th June 2000 the small-footprint airborne laser terrain \nmapper (Optech ALTM 1210) was flown over Monks Wood. \nThe ALTM operates at 1047nm (near-infrared) and on \naverage recorded one point (with a diameter of 0.25m) per \n4.83m2, with a minimum point density of 6.50m2 and a \nmaximum of 2.80m2 in areas of swath overlap [15]. The first \nand last returns were recorded enabling a DTM and canopy \nheight model (CHM) to be derived. Full details of the \nprocessing are given in [15], but in summary the first and last-\nreturn point cloud data were converted to a gridded product \nusing a triangulation algorithm. The last return data were then \nfiltered with an adaptive morphological filter to identify local \nminima, by varying the filter size based on canopy structural \nheterogeneity, to create a DTM [29]. The CHM was created \nby subtracting the DTM from the gridded first return data. The \nroot mean square error (RMSE) for the LiDAR derived \nproducts, when assessed against the theodolite data (described \nin Section II, part B), was 0.51m for the DTM and 1.28m for \nthe CHM [15], [29]. \nIII. DTM GENERATION \nTwo methods were applied to produce DTMs (Fig. 1). The \nfirst, the minimum filtering method, relies upon filtering the \nInSAR DSM height values to create the DTM from local \nheight minima, which are assumed to originate from the \nterrain under the vegetation canopy. The ancillary data method \nis the second method and it exploits various parameters from \nthe PolInSAR data set, plus some derived PolInSAR products, \nto identify ground pixels (Fig. 1). The ancillary data sets used \nwere coherence and backscatter, plus derived products such as \nthe spatial and spectral standard deviation and fraction of \nsurface scatter derived from a polarimetric decomposition \nalgorithm. The underlying physical principle is that the \nvolume scattering from the canopy layer and the surface \nscattering from the ground affect the radar signal in specific \nways, and consequently radar parameters can be used to infer \nscattering properties of the target.  \nThe ancillary data sets were incorporated into the DTM \ngeneration by applying a threshold to the ancillary data set \npixels to create a binary mask with 1 representing \u201cground\u201d \npixels and 0 \u201cnon-ground\u201d pixels (Fig. 2). The InSAR height \npixels which were identified as \u201cground\u201d pixels, via the \nthresholding, were then interpolated to create a terrain surface \nunder the wood. The final stage was the application of a mean \nfilter to smooth the DTM. To identify the most appropriate \nmean filter size a series of filters with windows of 5, 15, 25, \n35, 45, 55 and 65 pixels diameter were tested. To determine \nthe optimum threshold level for each of the ancillary data sets \na range of thresholds were also tested, which in conjunction \nwith the 6 InSAR DSM\u2019s available and the number of mean \nfiltering options applied led to 1428 DTM being created \noverall (see Table I). Details of the two methods are described \nbelow, including a brief rationale why we expect the ancillary \ndata sources to be able to separate ground pixels from canopy \npixels. \n \nA. Minimum filtering \nThe minimum filtering method uses only the InSAR DSM \nheight values, as the DTM is produced by applying a filter to \ndetermine local height minima and then smoothing with a \nmean filter (Fig. 1; Table I). Six window sizes were tested for \nthe minimum filter, specifically 3x3, 5x5, 7x7, 9x9, 15x15 and \n25x25 pixels. After the minimum filtering, to maintain \nconsistency with the ancillary data DTMs, 7 mean filter sizes \nwere applied (square filters of 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55 and 65 \npixels diameter) producing a total of 252 minimum filtered \nDTMs (6 input DSMs x 6 minimum filter sizes x 7 mean \nfilters). \n \nB. Data fusion using ancillary data  \nBackscatter: At L-band the radar signal penetrates the \ncanopy and is scattered primarily by tree branches and trunks, \nand is unlikely to interact with the ground, if the canopy is \ndense. Consequently, assuming stable moisture conditions, \nhigh biomass canopies generally produce high backscatter and \nlow biomass canopies low backscatter at L-band [30], [31], as \na result relatively low backscatter values are assumed to \ncharacterize \u201cground\u201d pixels, which are better suited for \ninclusion in the DTM generation. The backscatter coefficient \nwas the only logarithmically scaled (and hence non-linear) \nparameter used. The backscattering coefficient, \u03c30, was \ncalculated for the six polarizations (L-HH, L-HV, L-VV, \u03c51, \n\u03c52, \u03c53) and the thresholding was applied to the dB scaled \nvalues (Fig. 2, Table I). Fig. 3a shows the L-HH \u03c30 image of \nMonks Wood, with rides, gaps in the canopy and sparser areas \nof the canopy exhibiting low backscatter as expected from L-\nband scattering processes. \nInterferometric coherence: The coherence was calculated \nfor the L-HH (Fig. 3b), L-HV, L-VV polarizations and also \nfor the optimized channel polarizations. For the optimized \ncoherence, by definition, \u03c51 has the highest coherence and \u03c53 \nthe lowest. One consequence of this is that in some cases the \n\u03c53 coherence is too low to reliably determine the InSAR DTM, \nso it contains more missing pixels than the other channels. We \nset a coherence threshold of 0.2 below which we did not \ncalculate InSAR height. \n Interferometric coherence, for repeat-pass sensors, is a \nfunction of the temporal, volume and sensor decorrelation, \nwith the volume decorrelation being important for this \napplication. For predominantly ground pixels we expect only \na negligible amount of volume decorrelation, so the \ninterferometric coherence should be relatively high. \nTGRS-2006-00646 \n \n4\nConversely, for canopy pixels we expect high volume \ndecorrelation, due to the large number of scatterers in the \ncanopy, producing relatively low coherence. Temporal \ndecorrelation for volume scatterers within the image is also \nlikely to be increased by the windy conditions at the time of \nimage acquisition, even though the repeat-pass time (13 \nminutes) was short.  \nLow coherence may also occur due to low SNR resulting \nfrom the very low backscatter observed from smooth surfaces, \nwhich would confound our assumption that low coherence \nimplies volume scattering and hence presence of a vegetation \ncanopy. However, this behavior was not observed within the \nperimeter of the wood. The coherence thresholds applied are \ndetailed in Table I. \nSpatial InSAR DSM standard deviation: The spatial \nstandard deviation of the InSAR DSM\u2019s for each polarization \n(L-HH, L-HV, L-VV, \u03c51, \u03c52, \u03c53) was calculated over a 3x3 \nwindow. A small window size was chosen to allow detection \nof small gaps in the canopy. We assumed that the spatial \nstandard deviation of a cluster of bare ground pixels varies \nless than the canopy height at Monks Wood over an \nequivalent area, so that a low standard deviation is likely to \nindicate a cluster of ground pixels, whilst higher values \nsuggest canopy scattering (Table I). This assumption is less \nrobust than the others, as it is not based on the differences \nbetween SAR surface and canopy scattering mechanisms and \nwill be discussed later (section V part A). Fig. 3c shows that \ncanopy pixels in the Monks Wood data set have high spatial \nstandard deviation complying with our assumption. \nSpectral InSAR DSM standard deviation: The InSAR \nDSM\u2019s for the six polarizations (L-HH, L-HV, L-VV, \u03c51, \u03c52, \n\u03c53) were used to determine the spectral standard deviation \n(Fig. 3d). The rationale for using the spectral standard \ndeviation was that ground pixels would have low height \nstandard deviation across the six polarizations, whereas the \ndifferent polarizations would produce a range of phase \nscattering heights within the canopy and so a higher standard \ndeviation for canopy hits. The threshold levels are given in \nTable I. \nSurface scatter: The Freeman-Durden model [3] enables \ndecomposition of fully polarimetric SAR data into a \ncombination of three physically based scattering mechanisms, \nvolume scatter, double bounce scatter (e.g. ground-trunk \ninteractions in wooded areas) and rough surface scatter. The \ndecomposition is achieved through a simplified model of the \nscattering interactions, whereby the canopy scattering is \nsolved for a canopy layer of randomly orientated, thin \ncylindrical scatterers. Double-bounce scattering is modeled as \na dihedral corner reflector, with variable dielectric properties, \nwhilst surface scattering is modeled using a first order Bragg \nmodel [3]. The Freeman-Durden decomposition has been \nsuccessfully used to create ancillary data sets to improve \nspeckle-filtering of PolInSAR data [4]. \nThe Freeman-Durden decomposition was applied to the \nMonks Wood L-band E-SAR data to estimate the percentage \nof scattering attributed to each of the three scattering \nmechanisms. The surface scatter ground pixel selection, along \nwith the spectral standard deviation pixel selection, are \nindependent of polarization, as the same set of ground pixels \nare used for each polarization (Fig. 3e). For the other methods \nthe set of ground pixels selected will vary slightly depending \non polarization, although the number and distribution of \npoints is likely to be highly correlated between different \npolarizations. \n \nIV. VALIDATION OF THE 1428 DTMS \nThe accuracy of an interpolated DTM under a vegetation \ncanopy is dependent upon: \n1. A sufficient number and even distribution of ground \npixels being retained for the interpolation throughout the \nwood. This is determined by a variety of study site and sensor \ncharacteristics, including the scale of terrain variability, the \nspatial resolution and wavelength of the SAR system and \nattenuation of the signal in the canopy. \n2. Having a suitable method of separating and identifying \nthe ground or predominantly ground pixels from canopy \npixels. \nThe first point is addressed by the validation against the \ntheodolite elevation measurements and LiDAR DTM \n(described in point i) and iii) below), whilst the second point \nis addressed using a set of ground pixels derived from the \nLiDAR CHM. \ni) Accuracy assessment against theodolite data set - the \nInSAR DTM\u2019s are evaluated against the theodolite terrain \nelevation data set producing an estimate of the accuracy of the \nDTM against a high accuracy set of point data. \nii) Assessment of the pixels selected as ground \u2013 this stage \nof the assessment procedure is intended to investigate whether \nthe pixels identified as \u201cground\u201d via the thresholding of the \nancillary data sets, really are ground pixels. This was tested \nusing a LiDAR CHM [15] to determine the pixels where the \ncanopy was less than 1.0m tall, which we used as our \nreference set of ground pixels.  \niii) Spatial distribution of error \u2013 the final stage in the \naccuracy assessment was to assess the spatial distribution of \nerror for all the pixels, by comparing the InSAR DTM\u2019s to the \nLiDAR DTM [15] and assessing to what extent the InSAR \nDTM error is influenced by spatial factors, such as incidence \nangle. \nV. RESULTS \nA.  Accuracy assessment against theodolite data  \nA summary of the RMSE values, between the theodolite \nmeasurements and the best DTM surface (defined as the \nlowest RMSE against the test data) for each of the methods of \nDTM generation is given in Table II. The results show that the \nminimum filter produces the lowest RMSE result \n(RMSE=4.23m), with the surface scattering method producing \nthe second lowest result (RMSE=4.9m). The optimized \ncoherence \u03c52 and \u03c53 values produce the best results for most \nTGRS-2006-00646 \n \n5\nancillary data set methods, whereas the L-HH polarized data \nproduce the best overall result, via the minimum filtering \nmethod (Table II). Applying different mean filter window \nsizes to the DTMs typically produced relatively high error for \nlarge and small filter windows and reached a minimum at \nsome mid-range filter window size. Generally, the 55x55 pixel \nmean filter, corresponding to a 165m x 165m window, \nproduces the best result in Table II. This is a relatively coarse \nfilter given the small size of the wood and possibly highlights \nthe low rates of terrain elevation change and the subsequent \nhigh levels of spatial autocorrelation within this wood. This is \nillustrated in Fig. 4a which presents the best results from the \nminimum filtering and for an ancillary data set (specifically \nsurface scatter) and shows that there is systematic over and \nunder-estimation, presumably as a consequence of the \ninterpolation and filtering stages. \n Visual inspection of the distribution of elevation error \nacross the wood showed that at the south-eastern side of the \nwood the error was particularly high (discussed in section V \npart C). When the lower accuracy south-eastern theodolite \npoints are excluded from the analysis, the best \u03c30 ancillary \ndata DTM is more accurate than the best minimum filter DTM \n(Table III, Fig. 4b). This suggests that the minimum filter, \nwith the least input data has less error propagation and so is \nmore robust, than the data fusion methods. When the input \ndata are of higher quality, then the data fusion methods may \nproduce better results. It is also noticeable that the range in \nRMSE values is larger for Table III (1.59m between max. and \nmin. RMSE) than for Table II (0.59m), hence the choice of \nancillary data set has less impact on the accuracy of the DTM \nwhen assessed against the subset of theodolite points. \nThe improvement in the InSAR DTM accuracy for the \nwestern set of theodolite data is reflected in the reduction of \nthe mean filter size, between Tables II and III. Additionally, \nwith the exception of the spectral standard deviation, all the \nthresholds change so that the number of pixels, creating the \nsurface to be interpolated, is reduced between the best \nscenarios in Table II and III. This indicates that a spatially \nadaptive filter, possibly utilizing the coherence, in conjunction \nwith ground pixels identified from an ancillary data set may \nimprove the accuracy of the interpolated surface further. L-\nHH and \u03c53 consistently produce the highest accuracy DTM\u2019s \nsuggesting that they have the strongest scattering response \nfrom the ground, within the selected ground pixels. \nThe weakest rationale underlying the use of any of the \nancillary data sets was for the spatial standard deviation, as it \nwas assumed that low values signified a cluster of ground \npixels. However, in the quantitative assessment it produces \nsimilar results to the coherence data set (Tables II & III). \n \nB. Validation of ground pixel selection \nThe second stage of validation was to assess whether \nthresholding the ancillary data sets accurately identified \nground pixels. To investigate this we used the LiDAR-derived \nCHM to identify pixels where the CHM was less than 1m, \nwhich we took to be ground pixels. The LiDAR identified \nground pixels were then compared with the ground pixels \nselected by each of the ancillary data set scenarios (threshold \nand polarization combinations) to identify the highest \npercentage of accurately identified ground pixels (Table IV). \nThe ancillary data set scenarios identified in Table IV equate \nto a set of DTM\u2019s rather than a specific DTM, so for the \nbackscatter, coherence and spatial standard deviation data sets \na set of 7 DTM\u2019s is produced, as 7 mean filter sizes were \napplied (see Fig. 1). Whereas for the spectral standard \ndeviation and the surface scatter data sets, which are \npolarization independent, the number of DTM for a specified \nthreshold is determined by the number of mean filter sizes (7) \nand the number of polarizations (6) creating a set of 42 \nDTM\u2019s. Consequently, the RMSE values reported in Table IV \nare the lowest RMSE values for a set of 7 or 42 DTM.  \nThe maximum percentage of correctly identified ground \npixels is 98% for the coherence, although it is based on a \nsmall number of pixels and as the RMSE shows produces a \nvery poor set of DTM\u2019s. The spectral standard deviation \nscenario identified coincides with the best spectral standard \ndeviation result identified in Table II for the full theodolite \ndata set.  The maximum percentage values for the backscatter \nand surface scatter data sets were produced by the scenarios \nthat resulted in the highest accuracy in Table III and are based \non 3079 and 126 accurate ground pixels respectively. The \nlarge difference in the number of accurate ground pixels, \nbetween these two cases, has little impact on the ensuing \naccuracy of the DTM, which may imply the underlying terrain \nis relatively simple in shape and can be reconstructed \nrelatively accurately from a small number of well-distributed \npoints. The scenarios identified in Table IV coincide \noccasionally with the best results identified in Tables II and \nIII, however, knowledge of the percentage of accurate ground \npixels, or the number of accurate ground pixels does not relate \ndirectly to the quality of the final DTM. \n \nC. Comparison of InSAR and LiDAR DTMs \nThe focus of the final stage of evaluation was to assess the \nspatial distribution of error in an attempt to understand the \nlimiting factors. The two DTM\u2019s with the highest accuracy \nagainst the full theodolite data set (Fig. 4a), plus the two \nDTM\u2019s with the highest accuracy against the western subset \nof points (Fig. 4b), were selected for comparison with the \nLiDAR DTM. Fig. 5 shows the spatial distribution of error in \nthe four InSAR DTM\u2019s, using the LiDAR DTM as a reference \ndata set. The overall pattern of residual error is similar \nbetween the 4 DTM\u2019s displayed, with error lowest at the \nnorthern edge of the wood (near range position) and \nincreasing towards the southern (far range) and eastern edges, \nalthough at a finer scale there are distinct differences.  \nTo further investigate the residual error an analysis, with \nregard to incidence angle, canopy height and each of the \nancillary data types (i.e. coherence, backscatter etc.), was \nTGRS-2006-00646 \n \n6\nconducted. No relationship between the residual error and the \nancillary data sets or canopy height was found. The lack of \nrelationship between residual error and canopy height might \nappear unexpected, as canopy height and the probability of the \nradar penetrating the canopy to ground-level are often linked. \nHowever, Monks Wood has a dense shrub layer, which has a \npotentially greater impact on the probability of canopy \npenetration than the overall height of the canopy, as was \nfound in an earlier LiDAR-based study of Monks Wood [29]. \nA relationship between incidence angle and residual error was \nfound (Fig. 6), possibly due to increased signal attenuation at \nhigher incidence angles. The mean residual is relatively low \nbetween 39\u00b0 - 45\u00b0, before increasing for all but the most \ncoarsely filtered minimum filter DTM. This suggests that the \ncoarse filtering provided some immunity to the effects of \nincidence angle variations, although beyond 50\u00b0 all four \nDTM\u2019s show high residual error. Consequently, the error \ntowards the southern edge of the wood (far range) is thought \nto be due to incidence angle, whereas the error towards the \neastern edge may be due to phase unwrapping errors, as the \nerror extends eastwards into the croplands beyond the \nperimeter of the wood (Fig. 5 a-d).  \nVI. DISCUSSION \nThe data fusion method proposed has only been tested at \none study site and needs testing at further sites with both \nairborne and spaceborne data sets. In particular, it requires \nassessment on larger forested areas, with more varied \ntopography underlying the canopy. It would be worthwhile for \nthe InSAR community to compile an international \nexperimental database containing standardized data sets for a \nseries of test sites, against which to test new algorithms or \napproaches. The current situation of various approaches being \napplied to different areas and different InSAR sensors, with \nvarying degrees of validation, makes it difficult to compare \nmethods. Precedents for this have already been set by other \nremote sensing communities, with the model intercomparison \nexercise by the optical canopy reflectance modelers [32], [33] \nand the point cloud filtering experiment conducted by the \nLiDAR processing community [34]. In addition, work is \nrequired to determine a suitable error metric (or set of metrics) \nfor quantifying the accuracy of DTM under forest canopies \nwhere the error is very variable spatially. \nThe use of ancillary data sets to identify ground pixels for \nuse in DTM generation could potentially be extended to use \nother types of data, both to determine the ground pixels and \nalso to generate the DTM\u2019s. If the data are accurately geo-\nlocated, then data from other types of remote sensing sensor \nor even ground data might be suitable for incorporation. For \nexample, optical vegetation indices, such as the normalized \ndifference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference \nwater index (NDWI) could be produced and then thresholded \nto produce a mask of canopy or non-canopy (or sparse \ncanopy) pixels. One of the key problems would be differences \nin wavelength and hence canopy penetration, between the \nradar and optical sensors, as they respond to different \nbiophysical properties [12].  \nTwo of the ancillary data sets tested in this paper can only \nbe derived from a fully polarimetric interferometric data set \n(e.g. surface scatter, InSAR height standard deviation), \nwhereas the others can be derived from single polarization \nInSAR data (e.g. coherence, backscatter and spatial standard \ndeviation). The fact that three of the ancillary data products \ncan be generated from a single polarization InSAR data set \nmake the approach suitable for L-band spaceborne InSAR \nsensors like ALOS-PALSAR [35].  \nOur motivation for improving the quality of the DTM is to \nimprove the accuracy of canopy height mapping, using X-\nband InSAR data to map the top of the canopy and an InSAR \nDTM to map topography [14]. Once an accurate DTM is \nderived for an area it will not require updating, as frequently \nas the canopy height, so growth could be monitored by a one-\noff DTM generation, followed by periodic canopy height \nmeasurements with satellite-borne X-band InSAR. \nAlternatively accurate under-canopy DTM\u2019s could be useful \nin constraining the inversion process in PolInSAR canopy \nmodels, enabling alternative parameters to be retrieved in the \ninversion process. \nVII. CONCLUSIONS \nIn this paper we have proposed a method for using ancillary \ndata sets to determine likely ground pixels within a wood, \nfrom which to interpolate a DTM. The results show that the \nmethod has promise; in particular, the \u03c53 backscattering \ncoefficient to determine ground pixels produces better results \nthan the minimum filtering method, when assessed against a \nspatial subset of the theodolite data. An analysis of the InSAR \nDTM\u2019s against a LiDAR DTM showed that residual error was \ncorrelated to incidence angle, with incidence angles above 50\u00b0 \nparticularly associated with higher errors. Overall, whilst the \nmethod shows some promise it needs applying to other InSAR \ndata sets covering a range of forest and terrain types to \nprovide a full assessment of the method\u2019s limitations and \nrobustness. This type of analysis would be greatly facilitated if \nthe InSAR community compiled a standardized series of data \nsets for different types of forests and sensors against which \nnew algorithms and methods could be tested. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nWe would like to thank Ross Hill and David Gaveau (CEH \nMonks Wood) who processed and validated the LIDAR data \nand made the theodolite measurements.
