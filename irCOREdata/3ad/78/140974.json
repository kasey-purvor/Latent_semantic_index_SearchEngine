This paper presents a detailed numerical study of the mode I interlaminar fracture of \ncarbon\/epoxy composite laminates with z-fibre reinforcement. The study was performed using a double \ncantilever beam configuration. A finite element model was developed using thick-layered shell elements to \nmodel the composite laminates and non-linear interface elements to simulate the through thickness \nreinforcements. An existing micro-mechanical solution was employed to model the material behaviour of \nthe interface element. The numerical analysis showed that z-fibre pinning were effective in bridging \ndelamination when damage had propagated into the z-fibre field; these pins provided crack closure forces \nthat shielded the delamination crack from the full delaminating force and moment due to applied loads. \nTherefore, the z-fibre technique significantly improves the crack growth resistance and hence arrests or \ndelays delamination extension.

Introduction \nDelamination is the most detrimental failure mode in aerospace composite structures. To improve structural \ndamage tolerance, new composites with through-thickness reinforcements (TTR) such as z-fibre pinning \n(or z-pinning), stitching, and 3D woven fabrics have been developed and they are often referred to as 3D \nreinforced laminates [1-4]. Several experimental investigations have shown that these new composites offer \nsignificant improvements in fracture toughness, impact resistance, compression-after-impact strength, \ninterlaminar strength, and the stiffener\u2019s pull-off strength [5-12]. However, the in-plane properties of the \nTTR composites suffer some degree of reduction [13-15].  \nWhen a delamination crack develops, TTR forms a bridging area at the crack wake that shields the \ndelamination crack from the interlaminar stresses. The TTR bridging mechanics will modify the crack-tip \nstrain energy release rate and hence reduce the crack propagation rate. When the fibre bridging length (the \nlength of the crack where bridging occurs) is restricted to a zone that is much smaller in length than any \nspecimen dimensions (small scale bridging), the rising crack growth resistance (R-curve) can be regarded \n                                            \n*\n  Corresponding author.

Publisher: Elsevier Science.  \n \n \n \nas a material property. However, for many crack growth problems the bridging length can be comparable \nwith or exceed the specimen dimension. This is called large-scale bridging (LSB). In situations of LSB the \ndelamination process cannot be correctly described by the linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) theory \nbecause the order of the magnitudes of the bridging zone length and the total crack length become \ncomparable, and the delamination behaviour is not solely controlled by a single parameter, such as the \nfracture toughness of the material [16-21]. The R-curve is no longer a material property; it also depends on \nthe specimen geometry [17]. A robust tool is required for the analysis.       \nThis paper deals with z-fibre reinforced carbon\/epoxy composite, which is defined as laminate with up to \n5% volume fraction of fibrous or metallic reinforcement in the thickness direction. Previous studies have \nshown that z-pinning effect on stress singularity zones, such as crack-tip or laminate free edges where \ndelamination normally starts, is very small if z-fibres are still in the intact part of the laminate [13, 22]. \nTherefore the key task is to quantify z-pinning effect on delamination propagation rather than initiation. \nThe mode I interlaminar fracture has been a topic for many researchers using the double cantilever beam \n(DCB) configuration [19-21]. Analytical models solve the constitutive and equilibrium equations of the \nDCB by using the simple or shear deformation beam theories combined with discrete [19] or linear \ncontinuous bridging loads [20-21] for the z-fibre simulation. Under certain assumptions closed-form \nsolutions were derived outlining the large scale bridging mechanisms and their effects on the strain energy \nrelease rate (GI) of the laminate. In these beam models boundary conditions applied at the crack tip usually \nunderestimate the GI values at the crack front. Besides, when the bridging tractions are expressed as \nfunctions of the crack displacement, even using linear functions the resulting crack behaviour is generally \nnonlinear [21]. Moreover the DCB arms of a z-pinned specimen usually subject to large crack opening \ndisplacements due to large increments of the applied load required propagating the delamination; this will \nintroduce additional nonlinear behaviour.  \nAnother challenging problem facing the modellers is the simulation of the z-fibre behaviour. Research has \nshown the mechanisms of z-fibres bridging a delamination crack [5, 23]. The failure process often involves \nz-fibre debonding and sliding out from the laminate. From the modelling point of view, those complex \ndamage mechanisms can be incorporated into a bridging function F(u), that is the relation between the \nbridging traction force vector (F) acting on the fracture surfaces and the displacement vector of the z-fibre \ncross section at delamination wake (u)[24]. Depending on the fracture mode ratio and the kind of TTR, i.e. \nstitching or z-pining, several micro-mechanical models have been developed for a single bridging entity \n[25-28]. These bridging functions may be implemented into a structural model.  \nThe advancement of the finite element methods has provided a robust and flexible tool to solve the \naforementioned nonlinear problems [29-33] and to calculate accurately the GI values and mode ratios at the \ncrack front [34-38]. For example, a global-local FE analysis used 3D FE models with either layered shell or \nsolid brick elements in the fracture critical zones with the boundary conditions obtained from the global \nanalysis [38]. It has the capability to study in details the damage development in the key areas and optimise \nthe computational effort [39]. Another work employed 2D plane-strain FE analysis to study a z-pinned \nDCB by inserting an experimentally derived bridging law to find the effect of various z-fibre properties \n[23]. A strong dependence on the availability of experimental data was noticed; hence different tests would \nbe required for different material and z-pin quality.  \nThis paper presents a detailed 3D FE model for studying the characteristics of delamination fracture with z-\nfibre effect.  The work is aimed at the mode I model that can be further developed to model other single or \nmixed failure modes providing that the correct boundary conditions and micro-mechanical solutions are \nimplemented. The objective is to develop a design approach that combines the finite element method with \nan existing micro-mechanical material model so that the effect of z-pinning on delamination propagation \nmay be predicted.

The numerical \nsolutions were validated against available experimental data [7, 8].  \n2.  Problem Statement \n2.1. Theoretical beam model for large scale bridging. \nThe double cantilever beam (DCB) configuration illustrated in Fig 1a is often used to study the mode I \ndelamination problem. From the modelling point of view each DCB arm can be treated as an elastic beam \nsubjected to a distributed or discrete traction force \u03a6z(x) simulating the bridging action of the z-pins as \nshown schematically in Fig. 1b. The Euler-Bernoulli differential equations in the bridging domain and \nbeyond are: \n  0)(4\n4\n=\u03a6+ x\ndx\ndEI Z\n\u03b4\n    (0<x \u2264 D)   (1)  \n04\n4\n=\ndx\ndEI \u03b4                      (D<x)    (2) \nWhere, \u03b4 denotes the transverse deflection of the beam, D the length of the LSB zone, EI the flexural \nrigidity of the beam, and \u03a6z(x) the bridging forces.  \nThe data given in the problem, i.e. EI, \u03a6z, are not continuous in the entire domain. However, there have \nbeen attempts to solve the above equations analytically. Mabson and Deobald [20] assumed a linear \nrelationship for single z-fibre traction force and displacement and a linear distribution for \u03a6z(x). A closed-\nform solution was derived and useful design curves were obtained for two forms of through-thickness \nreinforcements, i.e. stitching and z-pinning. Liu and Mai [19] solved Eq. (1) by assuming a series of \ndiscrete non-linear bridging forces and using an approximate iterative method to obtain the solution. Both \npapers used the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and analytically derived bridging load-displacement \nrelationship for the z-fibre traction force simulation. Massabo and Cox developed another closed-form \nsolution under the crack-tip shear deformation assumption using different linear bridging laws, i.e. \nconstant, proportional linear, and general linear [21].  \nIn fact, the so-called large-scale bridging traction loads acting over the active bridging zone (D in Fig.1b) \ndepends on many variables, so it may be described more generically as a complex function \u03a6z(x): \n ),,,,,()( EIuPDcx ZZZ \u03c8\u03a6=\u03a6  (3) \nwhere, c is the z-fibre density, D the length of bridging zone involving many rows of z-pins, P the applied \nload, u the displacement vector within the LSB area, EI the flexural rigidity of the laminate, and Z\u03c8 the \nbridging load (force or moment) of a single ith z-fibre that itself is a function of many parameters depending \non the micro-mechanical model used:  \n ),,,,,,,,,( 00 dArEu tzzZZ \u03c3\u03c4\u03c4\u03c6\u03b8\u03c8\u03c8 =  (4) \nwhere, u is the displacement vector of the z-fibre cross section at delamination wake (Fig. 2), \u03b8  z-pin \nrotation in the x-z plane, \u03c6 z-fibre insertion angle, \u03c4  frictional shear stress at the z-fibre and laminate \ninterface during frictional sliding, \u03c40 shear flow stress due to sliding displacement (u1), \u03c30 the axial stress of \nthe z-pin rod, Ez the Young\u2019s modulus of z-fibre, rz z-fibre radius, tA  cross sectional area of z-pin, and d z-\nfibre insertion depth into the laminate.  \nIn this study, the bridging effect is modelled by implementing the discrete bridging forces, Eq. (4), into a \nfinite element model. \nComposites Science & Technology, 63 (2003), 1815-1832.

Therefore for \ndesign purpose it is important to know the energy absorption capability of a z-pinned laminate during \ndelamination growth. According to the Griffith fracture energy theory [40], an elastic body subjected to \nexternally applied loads must satisfy the following energy balance: \n \u0393+++= irke UUUW                                                   (5) \nwhere, W is the external work, Ue the stored elastic energy, Uk the kinetic energy, irU  the dissipated energy \ndue to some irreversible mechanisms, \u0393 the energy dissipation during the formation of a new crack surface, \ntherefore it is consumed only in a very small cohesive zone at the crack front. An increment in the crack \narea (dA) will require energy increment, but the overall energy balance of the system expressed by Eq. 5 \nremains valid: \n \n\u0393+++= ddUdUdUdW irke                                   (6) \nFor static fracture tests, the typical experimental loading rates are around 1 mm\/min under a displacement-\ncontrolled condition so the variation of the kinetic energy of the system is negligible. If the crack is \nassumed to be self-similar and dA=B\u00b7da, then the available elastic energy in the system per unit crack area \ncan be expressed as: \n  \u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\n+\n\u0393\n\u22c5=\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\n\u2212\u22c5\nda\ndU\nda\nd\nBda\ndU\nda\ndW\nB\nire 11\n                                (7) \nWith reference to mode I delamination of the z-pinned laminate, define: \n \u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\n\u2212\u22c5=\nda\ndU\nda\ndW\nB\nG eI\n1\n, \nda\nd\nB\nGIC\n\u0393\n=\n1\n,  \nda\ndU\nB\nir\nir \u22c5=\u03a6\n1\n       (8) \nWhere, GI is the strain energy release rate due to applied force, GIC the intrinsic delamination toughness of \nthe laminate, and \u0003 \u0004\u0001 the energy dissipation rate due to the irreversible z-pin pullout process, which is the \ntoughening mechanism of z-pinned laminates in terms of the fracture energy theory.  \nTherefore, the Griffith fracture criterion for z-pinned laminates can be written as: \n \u0005 \u0006\u0001+= ICI GG   (9) \nHere the strain energy release rate GI equals to the toughness of the z-pinned laminate during crack growth, \nwhich is the crack growth resistance.  \nZ-pinned laminates should be designed to achieve high value of irU that under certain crack conditions \nmay exceed the energy necessary for the creation of a new fracture surface, hence to increase the fracture \ntoughness. Thus the magnitude of irU is among the parameters that must be determined for the \ncharacterization of the fracture behaviour of z-pinned laminates. The LEFM theory assumes that all energy \ndissipations for the creation of a new fracture surface dA are included in the \u0393 term. It is hence postulated \nthat during interlaminar delamination in a conventional un-reinforced laminate the order of magnitude of \nother energy dissipation occurring away from the damage front zone are negligible, i.e. irU =0. The novel \nand strong point dealing with through-thickness reinforced laminates is the large amount of energy \nabsorption associated with the large scale bridging mechanics; hence the appearance of the Uir \nand \u0003 \u0004\u0001 terms in the above derived equations. \n3. Modelling procedures \nComposites Science & Technology, 63 (2003), 1815-1832. Publisher: Elsevier Science.  \n \n \n \n3.1 Model for z-fibre bridging mechanics \nThe micro-mechanical model developed by Cox [27] is used in this study. It is capable of dealing with \nmixed mode loading and inclined through-thickness reinforcements. The essential mechanisms of angled z-\nfibres bridging a delamination crack [5] are summarized in the following: \nZ-fibre debonding from laminate, frictional sliding and pulling out from the laminate; \nDevelopment of axial tension in the z-fibre rod during pullout process; \nAxial shear deformation with matrix damage and splitting cracks in the interior of the z-fibre; \nPloughing of the z-fibre rod laterally through the laminate, which resists lateral displacements via matrix \ndeformations and micro-cracking. \nThe output of the micro-mechanical model is a relationship between the bridging tractions applied to the \nfracture surfaces by the z-fibre and the crack opening and sliding displacements. For a single z-pin a \ntraction vector (F) is introduced along with the total crack displacement vector (u), which has two \ncomponents being defined in the local reference frame. This bridging traction law F(u) can incorporate all \nthose aforementioned complex phenomena. The simulation of the different mechanisms by F(u) also \ndepends on the initial orientation of the z-pins (\u03c6) and the applied mode ratio. Under the mode I loading \ncondition and when z-fibres are inserted at right angles (90o) to the principal in-plane axes (\u03c6 = 0o in Cox\u2019 \noriginal model), the geometric parameters and boundary conditions chosen for this study are illustrated in \nFig. 2. It is assumed that the sliding displacement (u1) and the in-plane z-pin rotation (\u03b8) due to the plastic \nshear deformation within the pin, were negligible and therefore the plastic shear flow \u03c40 = 0 and the \ncompressive transverse stress in the rod \u03c3n = 0.  \nThe z-fibre debonding and pullout resisted by friction is the dominant bridging mechanics, therefore in this \nstudy the micro-mechanical model of Eq. (4) is described by the Cox\u2019 bridging function, i.e. \u03c8z =F(u), \nwhich is a mono-dimensional function that relates the opening displacement (u=u3) to the force exerted \nalong the z direction in the crack reference frame. Fig. 2 shows the slip length (ls) has already attained the \nz-fibre embedded depth (d) and the pullout process is already propagated with a displacement s.    \nA set of computed force vs. deflection (F\u2013u) curves are plotted in Fig. 3. The range of the friction stress for \nfibre pullout was assumed to be between 10-80 MPa [23, 25]. Fig. 3 shows that there are two main \nmechanisms, i.e. z-fibre slips through the laminate developing axial tension due to the elastic stretching \n(Fig. 3a) and when the slip zone reaches the end of the bridging rod (ls=d), z-fibre slides and pulls out of \nthe laminate as a rigid body (Fig. 3b). It is clear that in this specific z-fibre configuration, the amount of \nenergy dissipated during the frictional sliding stage is much higher than the energy absorbed by the z-fibre \nslip stage. In the micro-mechanical model developed by Zhang et al [26], the same failure process was \nmodelled but the elastic stretching of the fully bonded z-fibre and debonding propagation was also \nconsidered. The energy absorbed during these phases was only a small percentage (1-2%) of the total \nenergy absorbed by the pullout failure process. It is then suggested that the assumption of the z-fibre being \nalready debonded would only introduce a small error in the FE simulation.  \nTo implement the above micro-mechanical solution into an FE model, z-pins in the delamination wake \nwere modelled by the interface element, COMBIN39, available from the ANSYS element library [33]. This \nis a 1D element with the capability of taking generalized non-linear force-deflection relations. The option \nprovides a uniaxial tension-compression element with up to three degrees of freedom at each node, i.e. \ntranslations in the x, y, and z directions; no bending or torsion was considered. The element is defined by \ntwo initially coincident nodes. When the delamination propagated a generalized force-deflection curve \nF(u), which is defined in a local reference frame, was adopted.  \n3.2 DCB finite element model \nComposites Science & Technology, 63 (2003), 1815-1832. Publisher: Elsevier Science.  \n \n \n \nAn FE model was created for a z-pinned DCB specimen (Fig. 4a) as shown in Fig. 4b. The numerical \nmodel consists of two different mesh zones: a coarse mesh for the undamaged part and a fine mesh in the \ndelamination growth zone. The area where interlaminar delamination was expected to grow was modelled \nwith two sub-laminates having the nodes coupled with an offset position at the delamination interface. The \ndisplacement matrices of the upper and lower sub-laminate were simplified by the coupled field \nassumption. The positioning of the z-fibre elements at the interface is also indicated in Fig. 4b. The \ndistance between two consecutive interface elements depends on the assumed z-fibre density and diameter. \nTable 1 shows some standard z-pin diameters and densities that were studied here. The non-linear layered \nshell element (Shell-91) from the ANSYS element library was found suitable to model the composite \nlaminate. It has several useful properties such as shape functions with transverse shear deformations [35], \nlarge deformation capability, quadratic element formulation [36], defining laminate stacking sequences and \nnodal offset positions through the thickness [38]. Cylindrical bending boundary conditions were imposed; \nwhilst the clamped beam end is to avoid numerical errors for an insufficiently constrained model. The \nmultiple-point constraint equations were applied to the nodes placed at the free ends to impose equally \napplied displacement.   \n       Table 1.

(9), the FE analysis allows a delamination crack to propagate \nwhen: \n  GI  - \u0003 \u0004\u0001 \u2265 GIC                                                                     (10) \nwhere, (GI - \u0007 \b\n\t ) is the net energy release rate at the crack tip considering the z-pin traction forces, which if \nlarger than GIC will cause equilibrium crack growth to occur.  \nThe value (GI - \u0003 \u0004\u0001 ) was calculated using the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT) [21] with the \nadvantage of only a single FE run being required. The nodal forces and displacements at delamination front \nneeded for the calculation were computed in a local reference frame following the crack propagation. Using \nthe ANSYS programmable language, several subroutines were developed and implemented into the main \ncode to model the following features: z-fibre material model, auto-meshing, computation of (GI - \u0003 \u0004\u0001 ) \nvalues, non-linear iterative solutions, and delamination growth simulation.   \nIn order to simulate the experimental work in [8], a displacement-controlled non-linear FE analysis was \nperformed using the full Newton-Raphson method in order to reduce the numerical error. A standard force \nand moment convergence criterion was used for the Newton-Raphson method and several other parameters \nwere also controlled and defined in order to optimise the iterative numerical solution, computational time \nand accuracy [33]. The solution-algorithm performs two main tasks: (1) if the criterion described by Eq. \n(10) is not met then the applied displacement is increased by a value of \u03b4i and the (GI - \u0003 \u0004\u0001 ) value at the \ncrack-front are re-computed; (2) if the failure criteria is satisfied then the nodes at the delamination front \nare uncoupled, the applied displacement remains unchanged, and a new calculation iteration is performed. \nThe structural stiffness matrix [K] is updated for every new crack position. During the solution process the \nprocedure also checks for bending failure of the beam and the analysis will be terminated at the maximum \ndelamination length of 30 mm. Convergence tests were undertaken with different mesh densities at the \ncrack front and different applied incremental displacement. In this study, numerical convergence was \nComposites Science & Technology, 63 (2003), 1815-1832. Publisher: Elsevier Science.  \n \n \n \nachieved by using the mesh size of 0.5 mm for the delamination growth front and incremental displacement \nof 0.2 mm. \n4.  Results & Discussion \n4.1 Numerical examples \nThe geometrical parameters for the DCB specimen modelled in this work (Fig. 4a) were taken from the \nexperimental tests in [23]. The DCB length (L) and width (B) are 160 and 20 mm, respectively, and the \nrange of the laminate thickness (2t) is between 3 and 6 mm. The length of the initial crack (ao) is 50 mm. \nThe distance between the initial crack tip and the first z-pin row is 5 mm, and the total length of the pinned \narea is 25mm (Fig. 4a). The DCB is made of carbon-epoxy IMS\/924 unidirectional plies with a single ply \nthickness of 0.125 mm and the following typical elastic properties: E11=138 GPa, E22=11GPa, \nG12=4.4GPa, \u03bd12=0.34. The z-fibres are made of carbon fibres. Four different z-fibre volume densities \n(0.5%, 1%, 2%, & 4%) and two typical z-fibre diameters (0.28 and 0.51 mm) were simulated. In order to \ntake account of the z-pinning effect on the laminate elastic properties the elastic bending stiffness in the z-\npinned area was modified according to a previous work[13]. Different z-fibre insertion depths (d) were also \nstudied to cover the range of partially and fully pinned laminates. Un-reinforced laminates were also \nmodelled as the control cases. \n4.2 Z-fibre effets on delamination propagation \nThe force-displacement curve is a good indication of the fracture process of a DCB specimen. At the first \nload step an applied displacement of 4 mm will bring the model close to the fracture condition described by \nEq. (10). An incrementally applied displacement of 0.1 mm (\u03b4i\/2) for each DCB arm is then applied. \nFirstly, the control case of an unpinned DCB specimen is shown in Fig. 5. The linear rising part of the \ncurve refers to the elastic deformation of the DCB arms without any damage propagation (first load step). \nWhen the fracture criterion (Eq. 10) was satisfied, delamination started to propagate. This initial crack \nextension occurred at the load level of 40 N. This load level is a turning point from which the external load \ndecreased with the increasing applied displacement. The experimentally measured data are also shown in \nthe same figure, and the agreement is excellent. The control specimen analysis was also useful to calibrate \nthe GIC value in Eq. (10). For this case the value of 250 J\/m2 was used for GIC, which was also used as the \ncritical value for the z-pinned laminates at the crack-tip zone.  \nFig. 6 shows the load-displacement curves of a z-pinned DCB configuration with an area density of 0.5%. \nThe z-fibres had a diameter of 0.28 mm. The critical load for initial delamination propagation was almost \nthe same as the un-reinforced laminate, around 40 N as indicated by the first load drop. However, the force \nquickly picked up and the curve shape after the initial delamination growth altered completely, i.e. from a \ndeclining P-\u03b4 curve of unpinned case (Fig. 5) to a rising curve (Fig. 6). This is because delamination has \npropagated into the z-fibre field where the resistance to damage growth is significantly higher than that of \nthe unpinned case. The sudden drop of the load at about 40N was due to the initial delamination \npropagation within the first 5 mm zone where no z-fibres were placed (Fig. 4a). After passing the first z-\nfibre row, the bridging mechanics worked by rising the external load (P) necessary to propagate the \ndamage further. Then at the load of 48 N there was another drop in the external load. This corresponds to \nanother damage growth just before meeting the next row of z-fibres. This phenomenon repeated regularly \nexhibiting stable crack propagation behaviour. This distinct shape of the P-\u03b4 curves in a through-thickness \nreinforced laminate was referred as the \u201cstick-slip\u201d behaviour in the literature [9,11]; it was assumed to be \ncaused by the presence of z-fibre or stitching rows at regular intervals. For a lower z-fibre density, a direct \nrelation between the number of working z-fibre rows and the observed local load drops of the P-\u03b4 curve \ncould be established. In this case (Fig. 6), five z-fibre rows were actively involved in the bridging field. \nComposites Science & Technology, 63 (2003), 1815-1832. Publisher: Elsevier Science.  \n \n \n \nAccording to the experimental work in [23], a suitable constant value of the frictional stress of 15 MPa was \nimplemented in the interface elements.  \nFig. 7 shows a higher density (2%) pinning case, in which two DCB specimens reinforced with 0.28 mm \ndiameter z-fibres were simulated. Both the numerical simulation and experimental data are shown in the \nsame graph for comparison. Firstly, the \u201cstick-slip\u201d characteristic in the P-\u03b4 curves of Fig. 6 (lower pin \ndensity of 0.5%) seemed to have disappeared in Fig. 7. This is because that more z-pins were in the \nbridging zone for the high-density case. The P-\u03b4 curves also show a maximum load value of about 180 N, \nafter which an increment of the applied displacement (0.2 mm) corresponds to a small decrement of the \nexternal load, and this corresponds to the full development of the bridging area. This will be discussed in \nSection 4.3. Secondly, a discrepancy between the experimental and numerical results was found in the first \nFE run (dashed line). A close examination of the failed fracture surface revealed that the position of the \nfirst z-pin row was misplaced just at 1 mm ahead of the initial crack position instead of the usual distance \nof 5 mm (Fig. 4a), for which the FE model mimicked initially. The FE model for this case was then \nadjusted by placing the interface z-fibre elements at the experimentally measured position. The effect of z-\npining on the elastic constants of the laminate was also taken into account by considering a more compliant \nlaminate in the z-pinned area of the laminate. This was done by changing the stiffness matrix constants of \nthe elements in the z-reinforced region of the model [13]. The revised FE model showed a much better \nagreement with the experimental data. This example demonstrates also the capability of the FE model \ndeveloped in this study. \n4.3 Large scale bridging effect \nThe LEFM theory assumes that all energy dissipations are confined within the crack tip zone. However, for \nreinforced laminates the z-fibres within the bridging zone will actively bridge the crack wake by producing \ntraction forces and consuming large amount of energy, which will delay the delamination progress. Our FE \nanalysis has found that the bridging force function \u03a6z(x) will reach its maximum value \u03a6max within the LSB \nzone that has length D and width B. It is also found that the maximum bridging effect is related to the \nnumbers of active z-fibre rows, the maximum bending moment, laminate stresses, and the maximum \nbridging length. These findings are summarised below and illustrated in Figs. 8-9.  \nA steady LSB zone would be developed soon after the first z-pin row was pulled out. During the \nsubsequent crack growth the LSB zone moved forward along with delamination front. Behind the LSB \nzone there was no traction force because those z-pins had already been pulled out (\u03c8z=0, Fig. 8). Similar \nsteady-state processes were reported for DCB specimens of the conventional laminates [17] and in stitched \nlaminates when the bridging entities started failing [11]. When the LSB process is fully developed, the \nbridging function \u03a6z(x) reached a constant value. In terms of the bridging force offered by each individual \npin, \u03c8z, when a new row of z-pins enters in the bridging zone another row will fail (z-pins pullout) leaving \nthe total amount of bridging forces acting in the bridging area almost constant. Then essentially we can \nwrite: \n constZ \u2245\u03a6    & const\nn\ni \u2245\u0007\n1\n\u03c8        (11) \nThe scenario expressed by Eq. 11 can be further demonstrated by Fig. 9 that shows the number of z-pin \nrows (left axis) versus delamination growth length. The white columns refer to the total number of z-fibre \nrows involved in the bridging process, the grey bars represent number of z-fibre rows in the maximum\n \nbridging area, and the black bars represent the z-pin rows that have already been pulled out (\u03c8z=0). The \nopen-circle points correspond to the number of z-fibre rows where the maximum bending moment \noccurred. The smooth curve plots the ratio of number of z-fibre rows in the \u03a6max area to the total number of \nworking z-pin rows; the value refers to the y-axis on the right hand side.  \nComposites Science & Technology, 63 (2003), 1815-1832. Publisher: Elsevier Science.  \n \n \n \n4.4 Effect of z-fibre density \nComputational P-\u03b4 curves for both z-pinned (four volume densities of 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 4% with z-fibre \ndiameter of 0.28 mm) and un-reinforced DCB specimens are presented in Fig. 10. Firstly, these P-\u03b4 curves \nshowed that the work done for the onset of delamination extension (at P\u224540N) did not change between the \npinned and unpinned models, while during the crack growth stage the work done for the reinforced \nspecimens rose to the values that were one order of magnitude higher than the that of the unpinned case. \nSecondly as soon as the delamination came across the z-pin bridging field the curve slope changed, which \nwas a function of the z-pin density.  \nThe maximum load in the P-\u03b4 curves is related to the pullout of the first z-fibre row defining the starting \npoint of the second stage of the delamination process when the so-called LSB is fully developed. It is also \nnoted that the displacement value at which the maximum load occurred increased with the increasing z-pin \ndensity.  \nHowever, the comparison of z-pin density effect in terms of P-\u03b4 relationship as made in Fig. 10 lacks the \nnecessary information about the growing delamination lengths and delamination front positions. Therefore, \nthe external load (P) is also plotted against the delamination length (a) in Fig. 11, which shows \ncomputational results (points) and polynomial fitted curves. The un-pinned specimen showed a decreasing \nexternal load (P) against the propagating delamination, i.e. less force was required as the crack became \nlonger. However, for all reinforced laminates the external load had to increase in order to advance the crack \nuntil the load reached its maximum value after which a slowly decreasing external load against crack length \nwas predicted. In terms of structural design the above result is significant. For example, in order to \npropagate a crack to 15 mm, a load of 37N would be sufficient for an un-reinforced laminate, whilst the z-\nfibre reinforced laminate needed much higher external load, e.g. 65, 98, 158, and 240 N, respectively, for \nthe various z-pin densities investigated. On the other hand, if the design load is defined, upper and lower \nbounds of the required z-fibre density can be determined. \nThe rising part in the P-a curves is characteristic of z-pinned laminate. This represents the stage when the \nfirst few z-pin rows are engaged in the bridging process. The stable LSB process will follow when P \nreached its summit. Note the sharp rise in the higher z-pin density cases. Those models that use uniformly \ndistributed z-pin traction forces would have difficulties to capture the sharp rise of the external force.        \nFor a higher z-pin density, the number of z-fibre rows involved in the bridging zone is also larger. \nTherefore, the displacement of the DCB arms would be larger in the LSB zone as shown in Fig 10, and this \nwill force the first row of z-fibres to stretch, debond, and pullout more quickly comparing to the cases of \nlower density reinforcement. Therefore, the higher the z-fibre density, the shorter the crack length at the \nsummit of the P-\u03b4 curves (Fig. 11) and the higher the non-linearity of structural deformation would be.  \nFrom the finite element results the number of times when delamination is temporally arrested can be \nworked out by counting the consecutive load points where the load is increasing but the delamination \nlength is constant (Fig. 11). It is found that the crack length at temporary arrestment corresponds to the \ninvolvement of a new z-fibre row entering the bridging process; as soon as the delamination front comes \nacross a new z-fibre row and the displacement vector u of the new bridging row becomes greater than zero \n(\u03c8z=F(u)>0), the crack will be arrested temporally. This phenomenon is more visible in laminates with \nlow-density z-pins than those with high-density pins in which cases crack arrestment can occur more often \ndue to more pins bridging the crack. For example, after 15 mm crack growth the 0.5% density pinned \nlaminate had 3 rows of z-pin involved in the bridging process, 1% had 4 activated rows, 2% had 6 rows \nbridging the crack, and 4% had 7 working rows (Fig. 11).  \n4.5 Effect of z-fibre diameter \nComposites Science & Technology, 63 (2003), 1815-1832. Publisher: Elsevier Science.  \n \n \n \nFig. 12 shows the results of external load (P) against delamination length (a) for two z-fibre radii (r1=0.14 \nmm and r2=0.25 mm). The z-fibre density was kept constant (2%) in the FE models by placing the interface \nelements at different positions as indicated in Table 1. All the other parameters of the finite element and \nmicro-mechanical models were unchanged. The result of unpinned specimen is also reported for \ncomparison. The better performance of the smaller z-fibre radius (r1) was demonstrated. When the LSB \nprocess was fully developed, the laminate pinned by smaller diameter z-fibres provided more resistance to \ndelamination growth; the external load was almost doubled than that by using the thicker z-fibre (r2) option. \nThe FE results also shows that before reaching the stable bridging configuration at the same crack length of \n16 mm seven rows of thinner z-fibres (radius r1) and four rows of thicker z-fibres (radius r2) were passed \nby the delamination front, respectively. \nSince most energy dissipation is spent during the z-pin pullout process, smaller z-fibre diameter will be a \nbetter choice. This was also confirmed by the micro-mechanics solutions [5, 27].   \n4.6 Effect of friction energy \nThe interfacial frictional stress (\u03c4) between a z-fibre and the surrounding laminate during frictional sliding \nwill also affect the value of z-fibre bridging traction force. In [19,23] typical range of the frictional stress \nwas suggested to be between 10 and 80 MPa for the same range of z-fibres and laminate systems used for \nthis study. Fig. 13 shows the effect of different frictional stresses ( 2510 \u2264\u2264 i\u03c4  MPa) on delamination \ngrowth in terms of external load (P) against propagating delamination length (a) for the case of 0.5% \ndensity pinned laminate with 0.28 mm diameter carbon pins. An increased friction shear stress (\u03c4) \ncorresponds to an increased LSB effect. When \u03c4 increases, the maximum load position shifts to the left of \nthe graph indicating a smaller bridging domain (D) but more resistant to further delamination. Therefore, \nthe higher the frictional energy dissipated, the lower the number of z-pin rows actively involved in the \nbridging process, and the smaller the crack length when stable constant bridging process occurs. \nComparing the plots in Figs. 11 and 13 it is noticed that the 0.5% density pinned laminate with an assigned \nfriction stress of 25 MPa could generate a LSB zone that is equivalent to the one of a 1% density reinforced \nlaminate with a friction shear stress of 15 MPa. Therefore from a design point of view, if higher frictional \nresistance can be achieved, then lower density z-pinning could be applied introducing less in-plane fibre \nwaviness and less stiffness degradation, saving weight and costs in reinforcing the structure. \nTo achieve higher frictional shear stresses and therefore higher bridging forces different options are \navailable: enhancing the z-fibre surface roughness, choosing appropriate resin system, and optimising the \nradial stresses arising from the initial thermal mismatch between the z-fibres and surrounding materials.  \n4.7 Effect of laminate flexural rigidity and z-fibre insertion depth. \nFig. 14 shows the effect of the laminate elastic modulus on delamination growth of z-pinned laminates. The \nslopes of the curves either before or after the fully developed LSB process were almost the same for the \nthree selected laminates with different elastic moduli (Ex). Only the values for the initial delamination load, \nthe maximum load, and relative crack position were moderately affected by the difference in laminate \nelastic properties. From the value of the crack length where LSB process attained a steady-state, it can be \nconcluded that the more compliant the laminate arms, the fewer z-pin rows involved in the LSB process \nand the smaller the crack length for stable bridging will be.  \nAccording to a previous study the Young\u2019s moduli of pinned laminates are about 7-10% lower than those \nof unpinned laminates [13]. Hence correct moduli for pinned laminates were used in the numerical \nsimulations. However, the numerical results showed that the laminate Young\u2019s modulus does not affect the \nz-fibre displacement vector (u) and thus indirectly, its bridging behaviour noticeably; the bridging load (\u03c8z) \nis governed by the micromechanical parameters of the z-fibre (Eq. 4). In this case the rigid pullout of a z-\nComposites Science & Technology, 63 (2003), 1815-1832. Publisher: Elsevier Science.  \n \n \n \nfibre is the dominant mechanics that is governed by the friction stress (\u03c4) between the z-fibre and the \nlaminate.  \nFig. 15 shows the effects of thickness (2t) of the DCB and z-fibre insertion depth (d) along with the results \nfor the unpinned specimens. Firstly, the thickness variation affects laminate flexural rigidity and therefore \nas the previous computation (Fig.14) a small translation of the maximum load position to a longer \ndelamination length. For the 3 mm thick (2t) laminate after 15 mm of delamination propagation the LSB is \nfully developed, but for the thicker laminate (2t=6) with the maximum z-pin embedding depth (2t=2d=6 \nmm), 30 mm crack is needed for all z-fibres actively bridging the crack wake. In terms of the z-fibre \ninsertion depth (d), for the same z-pin density and diameter, the deeper the z-fibre embedded in the \nlaminate, the higher the required load would be to propagate the delamination. As for the case of the \nfrictional stress, when the dominant mechanism is the z-pin pull-out process a more resistant LSB function \ncan be achieved by a deeper embedding depth (d); the best embedding depth is the full laminate thickness.  \n4.8 Energy balance and fracture toughness during LSB \nAs a by-product, the energy balance described by Eq. (5) was calculated from the FE outputs. In Fig. 16 \nindividual energy components of the DCB are plotted against the delamination length. The graph refers to a \nDCB model reinforced by z-fibres of 1% density and 0.28 mm pin diameter. When the delamination \npropagated into the first 5 mm (no z-pins in this region), the difference between the total external work (W) \nand the elastic deformation energy (Ue) equalled to the fracture energy at the delamination front (\u0393). The \nLEFM assumption remains valid until the crack reaches 11 mm. From this stage the energy absorbed by the \nLSB mechanism (Uir) became higher than the energy dissipated at the delamination front. The term Uir \ncould not be neglected anymore. Moreover, since Uir increased significantly with the delamination growth, \nthe difference between the external work (W) and the stored deformation energy (Ue) had to increase in \norder to provide more driving force for crack growth. Since the fracture energy at delamination front (\u0393) \ndepends only on the properties of the laminate, the \u0393 curve should be a constant for any pin diameters. \nBased on these findings, a good design approach for z-fibre reinforced structures should aim at maximizing \nthe energy absorption capability (Uir) during the LSB process.   \nThe energy rates per unit crack extension, GI, \u0003 \u0004\u0001 , and GIC, as defined by Eq. (8), were also calculated and \nshown in Fig. 17. At a very small cohesive zone of the crack tip, the fracture surface energy rate GIC has a \nconstant value of 250 J\/m2 for both pinned and unpinned laminates. The \u201csquare\u201d and \u201cstar\u201d symbols \nrepresent the computational results of strain energy release rate (GI) and energy dissipation rare ( \u0003 \u0004\u0001 ), \nrespectively. The smooth lines are fitted curves. The results confirm the energy rate balance for z-pinned \nlaminates described by Eq. (9). The strain energy release rate (GI) defined in Eq. (8) represents the \ntoughness of a z-pinned laminate during mode I crack growth. Therefore, it is possible to validate the GI \nvalues by experimentally measured data, and then to quantify the calculated \u0003 \u0004\u0001 values indirectly given that \nGIC is a constant of the material.   \n5.  Conclusions \nA numerical approach that combines the computational accuracy and versatility of the finite element \nmethod with an existing micro-mechanical material model is presented. The numerical simulation was \nexecuted by including as many parameters as possible to characterise the mode I fracture behaviour of z-\npinned laminate. Satisfactory agreement with experimental data was obtained. Following conclusions may \nbe drawn.   \nThe z-fibre technique is very effective in enhancing the resistance to mode I delamination growth. The \nrelationship of external load versus delamination length is found to be a better indicator for the fracture \nresistance and the large scale bridging effect. However, z-pinning had no noticeable effect on the onset (or \nComposites Science & Technology, 63 (2003), 1815-1832. Publisher: Elsevier Science.  \n \n \n \ninitiation) of delamination growth from a starter crack. This observation is consistent with the experimental \nresults.  \nThe effectiveness of z-pinning is mainly owing to the formation of a large scale bridging (LSB) zone \nbehind the advancing crack. The LSB can become a stable process when some z-fibre rows are pulled out \nfrom the laminate. In order to activate the z-fibre bridging mechanism a delamination crack needs to \npropagate into the z-fibre field for several millimetres; the LSB can then stabilize or even temporally \narrests the delamination crack. Therefore z-pinning is very useful for damage tolerance design. The \nmagnitude of the LSB is independent of the crack length; an almost constant bridging area translates \nforward as the crack propagates. \nDelamination resistance can be further enhanced by choosing higher z-fibre density, increasing friction \nstress at the laminate and z-pin interface, employing finer z-fibre diameters and deeper z-fibre embedding \ndepth. The laminate flexural rigidity influences the number of working z-pin rows in the LSB zone and the \ncrack length at which the LSB process will reach a steady state. \nIn terms of energy balance z-pinned laminates have good capability of energy absorption. During \ndelamination growth the large scale bridging process absorbs considerable amount of energy that otherwise \nwould have been used for delamination growth. The assumption made by the LEFM that all energy \ndissipations are included in the fracture energy and confined within the damage front is not valid for z-\npinned laminates. The irreversible energy dissipation due to z-pins pulling out becomes the dominant term \nin the energy balance to enhance the fracture toughness of z-fibre reinforced laminates.  \nAcknowledgements \nThe work was funded by the DTI CARAD programme via the MERCURYM project.
