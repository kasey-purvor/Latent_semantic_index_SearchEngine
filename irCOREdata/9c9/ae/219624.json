This paper probes that fault-line.2 It does so in an \nunashamedly academic way by reviewing theoretical literature and developing \narguments. Some policy implications of this stance are developed in the paper by Allister \nMcGregor. \n \nIt is divided into three parts following this introduction. The first part looks at human well-\nbeing and is itself in divided into three. First, it sets out the intellectual case for a \nuniversalist understanding and appreciation of all people\u2019s capabilities and needs which, \nat whatever remove, underpin such global initiatives as the Millennium Development \nGoals. Then it rehearses the case for localism, respect for people\u2019s values and \nknowledges, the \u2018understanding of understandings\u2019. The third section considers and \nevaluates theoretical attempts to communicate between the universal and the local and \nat ways of reconciling the two. Part two turns to the world of institutions and structures. \nThis considers and critiques theories of globalisation as a universal trajectory. It then \nmoves on to expound and defend multi-level and middle-range frameworks, in particular \nthe regime paradigm for understanding the generation of welfare, illfare, security and \ninsecurity in the contemporary world. The paper concludes by bringing together the two \nperspectives advocated and favoured in the paper and sketching out their mutual \nsupport and interactions. It concludes by restating the case for critical autonomy as a \nuniversal basic need, coupled with participation and diverse middle-range structures to \nfoster its enhancement. \n \nSince at least Max Weber\u2019s (1921\/1972:4) distinction between Erkl\u00e4ren and Verstehen, \ntwo fundamental approaches can be distinguished in the social sciences (Nussbaum \n1993:233). On the one hand an attempt to develop social sciences in the manner of \nnatural sciences, understanding outcomes detached from the self-understandings of \npeople in social contexts. In the hands of economists this generates simple but powerful \nconcepts and measures of human well-being in terms either of revealed preferences or \n                                                 \n1 Cited by Timothy Garton Ash, \u2018Beyond the West\u2019, Guardian 10\/6\/04.

On the other hand, stands a hermeneutic \napproach which brings people\u2019s own self-interpretations centre-stage, in the manner of \nmuch anthropology and cultural studies. Writing of developments in the study of history, \nHobsbawm (2002: 294) notes that the latter perspective gained ground some time in the \nearly 1970s: there was a turn \u2018from structure to culture, from Braudel to Geertz, from \nanalysis to description, from telescope to microscope\u2019. Despite a regular barrage of \ncriticism it is hard not to conclude that this remains the case today. \n \nYet when we turn to the real world of institutions, politics and power a quite different \n\u2018story\u2019 dominates.3 Globalisation is perceived as a structural force-field adapting all \npractices, cultures, localities and groups that stand in its way. The dominant economic \nversion argues that the power of capital (whether structural or voice-based) is winning \nout and constraining agents and autonomy across the world, states are losing their \ncapacities to govern and the result is a relentless race to the bottom in everything from \ncultural preferences to labour and living standards. In the world society version a more \nDurkheimian process is at work as global norms and discourses are imported into every \nnational setting, whatever the mismatch with reality. Again, despite numerous attempts \nto critique this structuralist understanding, it remains prevalent among both globaphiles \nand globaphobes.  \n \nThus the two discourses \u2013 on the nature of wellbeing and on the institutions, processes \nand policies that affect wellbeing in developing countries \u2013 are disconnected. This \ndisadvantages peoples \u2013 and notably the poor - in the developing world, for two reasons. \nFirst, they are deprived of influence over discourses and debates about universal and \nglobal goals. Second, they are deprived of influence over discourses and debates about \nlocal and place-specific means and policies. \n \nIf, as I have argued with Len Doyal (Doyal and Gough 1991, ch.8), basic human needs \nare universal but need satisfiers are place- and time-specific, then the ability to influence \ncollective understanding of both is lost. The former is lost because all talk of human \nuniversals is allegedly modernist, imperialist, Western. The latter is lost because in \npractice powerful global agencies promulgate and implement \u2018one size fits all\u2019 policies \nthat ignore local realities on the ground. In this topsy-turvy world, core values and needs \nare relative and local, while means and policies are global and universal. This paper \nseeks to challenge this worldview. \n \n \nHUMAN WELLBEING \n \nThe universal \n \nThe idea that all humans share characteristics and capacities in common is well-founded \nyet remarkably difficult to conceptualise and operationalise. In an extensive range of \nwritings, Amartya Sen (1982, 1984, 1985, 1999) identifies functionings as what a person \nmanages to do or to be, and capabilities as the different combinations of beings and \ndoings she or he is able to achieve. Sen has applied this framework in empirical studies \nof famine and illiteracy, for example. However, he is loath to concretely specify a list \neven of basic functionings and is wary of challenging \u2018local, internal conceptions of well-\n                                                 \n3 I am indebted to Chris Holden for this insight \n 3 \nbeing in the name of participation. Sabina Alkire\u2019s recent book Valuing Freedoms (2002) \nreveals both the richness and the intractabilities of this approach.  \n \nMartha Nussbaum has developed an alternative \u2018thick\u2019 neo-Aristotelian notion of human \ncapabilities which both parallels and differs from Sen (Nussbaum 2000). She extols a \nbroad vision of human flourishing and is prepared to identify a lengthy cross-cultural list \nof human \u2018functional capabilities\u2019. In applying her perspective, she has skilfully and \neloquently confronted these with the political dilemmas of deprived groups, especially of \nwomen in India. However, the foundations of her approach are controversial and its \npotential for securing cross-cultural consensus is thus far unproven.  \n \nIn A Theory of Human Need (1991) Len Doyal and I identify a conceptual space of \nuniversal human need, recognize cultural variety in meeting needs, but aim to avoid \nsubordinating the identification of needs to such cultural contexts. Starting from an \nexplicit critique of cultural relativism we claim to develop a universal, objective \nconception of human welfare. The argument is explicitly hierarchical and moves in the \nfollowing stages (Doyal and Gough 1991, chapters 4, 8; Gough 2003, 2004).  \n \nWe begin by distinguishing between needs and wants, according to the nature of the \ngoals referred to. Need refers (implicitly if not explicitly) to a particular category of goals \nwhich are believed to be universalisable, whereas wants are goals which derive from an \nindividual\u2019s particular preferences and cultural environment. The universality of need \nrests upon the belief that if needs are not satisfied then serious harm of some objective \nkind will result. We define serious harm as fundamental disablement in the pursuit of \none\u2019s vision of the good, whatever the nature of that vision. It is not the same as \nsubjective feelings like anxiety or unhappiness. Another way of describing such harm is \nas an impediment to successful social participation. Whatever the time, place and \ncultural group we grow up and live in, we act in it to some extent. We argue that we build \na self-conception of our own capabilities through interacting with and learning from \nothers. It follows that participation in some form of life without serious arbitrary limitations \nis a fundamental goal of all peoples. \n \nThis enables us, second, to define basic needs as those universal preconditions that \nenable such participation in one's form of life. We identify these universal prerequisites \nas physical health and autonomy. Survival, and beyond that a modicum of physical \nhealth, is essential to be able to act and participate. But that is not enough. Humans, \ndistinct from other species, also exhibit autonomy of agency \u2013 the capacity to make \ninformed choices about what should be done and how to go about doing it. This is \nimpaired, we go on to argue, by severe mental illness, poor cognitive skills, and by \nblocked opportunities to engage in social participation. At a higher level, we can talk of \ncritical participation \u2013 the capacity to situate the form of life one grows up in, to criticise it \nand, if necessary, to act to change it. This more dynamic type of participation requires a \nsecond-order level of critical autonomy. Without critical autonomy, the ability of human \nsocieties to adapt to changes in their environment would be gravely weakened. \n \nAccepting that these common human needs can be met in a multitude of different ways \nby an almost infinite variety of specific \u2018satisfiers\u2019, we go on, thirdly, to identify those \ncharacteristics of need satisfiers that everywhere contribute to improved physical health \nand autonomy. These we label \u2018universal satisfier characteristics\u2019, or intermediate needs \nfor short. We group these characteristics into the following categories: adequate \nnutritional food and water, adequate protective housing, nonhazardous work and \n 4 \nphysical environments, appropriate health care, security in childhood, significant primary \nrelationships, physical and economic security, safe birth control and childbearing, and \nappropriate basic and cross-cultural education. All eleven are essential to protect the \nhealth and autonomy of people and thus to enable them to participate to the maximum \nextent in their social form of life. These \u2018intermediate needs\u2019 are based on the codified \nknowledge of the natural and social sciences.. This knowledge changes and typically \nexpands through time \u2013 today often at dizzying speeds \u2013 through time. We are \ncomfortable to acknowledge that humans as a species have made and continue to make \nprogress in their capacity to understand and satisfy their needs (Doyal and Gough \n1991:111). The concept of human need we develop is historically open to such continual \nimprovements in understanding. We thus end up with a hierarchical list of concepts \nembracing basic and intermediate needs, all of which purport to be universal and cross-\ncultural. \n \nHowever, when identifying specific need satisfiers, this common codified knowledge \nmust be complemented by the experientially grounded local knowledge of people in \nspecific contexts. Normatively, if need satisfaction is to be optimized, all groups with \nknowledge about this context should have the ability to participate in research into need \nsatisfiers and to contribute to policy-making. We conclude that any rational and effective \nattempt to resolve disputes over needs \u2018must bring to bear both the codified knowledge \nof experts and the experiential knowledge of those whose basic needs and daily life \nworld are under consideration .. It requires a dual strategy of social policy formation \nwhich values compromise, provided that it does not extend to the general character of \nbasic human needs and rights\u2019 (Doyal and Gough 1991:141).  \n \nOur theory of human need perhaps sits between the Sen and Nussbaum approaches \n(Gough 2003). By expounding a thin derivation, and by distinguishing autonomy of \nagency from critical autonomy, it recognises cultural differences within a universalist \nframework, but by positing universal satisfier characteristics and recognising our \ncollective understanding of these it provides a potentially richer framework for conceiving \nand measuring human well-being.  \n \nBut all three lend support to common criteria and indeed some common measures of \nobjective well-being. These include most of the Millenium Development Goals, such as: \nto reduce infant and child mortality rates, maternal mortality rates, to provide access for \nall who need reproductive health services,  to reduce the proportion of people living in \nextreme poverty, to enroll all children in primary school by 2015 and to eliminate gender \ndisparities in primary and secondary education by 2005.  \n \nSuch universalist perspectives on wellbeing have been challenged on at least three \ngrounds: their individualism, objectivism, and paternalism (eg. Tao and Drover 1997; \nMenon, 2002). I address only the last here. Do not such approaches imply that we, or \nWestern philosophy, or experts, know best? Any simplistic criticism along these lines \ncan be countered in two ways. First, all recognise the role of wide participation and \nexperiential knowledge in understanding needs and need satisfiers. Second, and more \ngenerally, our substantive theory outlined above is complemented by a procedural \ntheory, drawing on Habermas and Rawls, which specifies desirable social procedures \n 5 \nand institutions to permit effective debate and decisions on identifying needs and \nsatisfiers in specific contexts.4  \n \nYet, this still leaves unanswered the question: \u2018who are the \u201cwe\u201d?\u2019 From what external \nstandpoint do such universalist argument stem? Too often the implicit assumption is that \nthere is some invariant external scientific or normative standpoint: in Nagel\u2019s (1986:5) \nterms, \u2018a view from nowhere\u2019. On the contrary, as Myrdal (1962) put it, \u2018a view is only \npossible from a viewpoint\u2019. This issue is addressed below. \n \nThe Local \n \nGeertz\u2019s (1983:4) contention that \u2018the shapes of knowledge are always ineluctably local, \nindivisible from their instruments and their encasements\u2019 entails a hermeneutic approach \nto understanding well-being; the \u2018understanding of understanding\u2019. It eschews common \ncriteria of well-being in favour of local, bottom-up understandings. This points to a third \ndimension of well-being, beyond both the objective conception outlined above, and the \nindividual-subjective conception as measured by psychologists, quality of life \nresearchers, the new \u2018economics of happiness\u2019 and others.5 This third dimension is the \n\u2018relational\u2019 and concerns itself with the way subjective perceptions and objective \noutcomes are constituted through social interaction and cultural meanings \u2013 with how \npeople experience wellbeing as a whole (White and Pettit 2004: 4).6  \n \nThis supports participatory approaches to researching wellbeing - from the Participatory \nRural Appraisal exercises from the late 1980s to the World Bank\u2019s Participatory Poverty \nAssessments and Voices of the Poor study (Narayan et al 2000a and b). The case for \nparticipatory approaches is strong. It includes both intrinsic arguments (from Freire\u2019s \n\u2018conscientisation\u2019, through empowerment to the modern concern with voice), and \ninstrumental arguments (participation taps the experiential local knowledge of the poor \nrather than relying on outsiders \u2018bussed in\u2019 for a few days). It has generated new \nunderstandings, for example the significance of gender in influencing both values and \nknowledge (White and pettit). I return to some of these issues below. \n \nHowever, there are also fundamental problems faced whenever, in such research, the \nuniversal is replaced by the local, \u2018the telescope for the microscope\u2019. Participatory \nreseach can hide diversity and present a falsely homogenous view of the \u2018community\u2019 it \nis studying. This is a particular danger given its ancestry in community mobilisation and \ncollective action. The facilitators \u2018are actively involved in creating that community, and \nthe shared interpretation of reality that animates it\u2019 (White and Pettit 2004). This criticism \nis of course well recognised (Cooke and Kothari, 2001). Some, such as Clark (2002), \nreject the use of focus groups and other collective methods precisely because they \nusually favour the voices of the powerful and well-connected over those of the poor and \nexcluded.  \n                                                 \n4\n The absence in our theory of Sen\u2019s important distinction between functionings and \ncapabilities weakens our own democratic and consensual intent. The functioning\/ \ncapability distinction would help the needs approach avoid lingering charges of \npaternalism. \n5 Unfortunately there is not the space in this paper to consider this whole third realm of \nsubjective well-being.  \n6 The WeD programme at Bath is premised on this threefold conceptualisation of well-\nbeing - see www.welldev.org.uk\/ \n 6 \n \nHowever, the individual-focussed methods often advocated in their place face a different \nproblem. Asking individuals about their values, expectations, preferences, achievements \nand satisfactions raises profound questions about what economists call \u2018adaptive \npreferences\u2019 and sociologists \u2018internalised common sense\u2019 or \u2018habitus\u2019. The former refers \nto adaptations to local realities that are not consciously perceived. The latter to ways of \nseeing that are profoundly internalised and of which individuals-in-contexts are unaware. \nI return to these issues below. \n \nAnother, more practical problem with a strong localist approach to researching well-\nbeing is that it provides little guidance on how to compare or evaluate well-being across \ncommunities, cultures and nations. Hence this critique has had relatively little impact on \nthe work of international agencies, such as the World Bank and UNDP, and their \nresearch and policy agendas.  \n \nReconciling the universal and the local \n \nLet me approach this from two directions: first from the local upwards and then from the \nuniversal downwards. Building on Sen\u2019s work and applying it to poverty reduction in poor \ncountries, Alkire (2002) distinguishes four merits of \u2018participatory processes\u2019, two of \nwhich we have already encountered. First, they have intrinsic value in empowering \npeople and thus in enhancing what Sen calls \u2018agency achievement\u2019. Second, they \nnormally have instrumental value in generating a more accurate appraisal of local needs \nthrough tapping local sources of understanding.7 But third, they can have constructive \neffects. By this Sen and Alkire signal the way in which learning from one another can \nrefine and reformulate values. In a collective process beliefs can be challenged by \nsceptics and critics within the community. Informed scrutiny and the subsequent \nacquisition of knowledge helps clarify what the group as a whole really wants. In a joint \npaper with Nussbaum Sen traces this back to Aristotle\u2019s argument that \u2018individual \nclarification and communal attachment\u2019 can be reconciled by a cooperative critical \ndiscourse (Nussbaum and Sen 1989).  \n \nThe fourth and last case for participatory processes goes further still. It is that \nparticipation can have \u2018intransitive or reflexive effects\u2019 on identity and culture (Alkire \n2002). This argument builds on Geertz. Development\u2019 is in part about introducing novel \npractices, but if this happens without participation the identity of the local culture may be \nundermined or destroyed. Since cultural beliefs are interlocking \u2013 they have a \u2018strain \ntowards consistency\u2019 (Keesing 1974) - imported beliefs cannot be simply added on to \nexisting beliefs. But participation can help integrate new beliefs into the identity or \ncharacter of a community. An example from Thailand in 2002 concerns an 8 month \nproject using participatory methods to produce emic indicators of happiness. A group of \n\u2018local intellectuals\u2019 who participated in this reported lasting effects on their happiness, \nvalues and behaviour. Moreover, Ryan and Deci\u2019s theories of motivation predict that \nintegrating new beliefs, rather than incorporating them through introjection or external \nregulation, improves the quality of the experiences.8 \n \n                                                 \n7 The \u2018normally\u2019 here refers to the distorting effect noticeable in \u2018societies with mafias\u2019 \n(Alkire 2002:133). \n8\n I am grateful to Laura Camfield for these points. \n 7 \nThese arguments endorse Sen\u2019s disagreement with communitarianism - his unremitting \ninsistence that all communities, even the most small and isolated, exhibit diverse \nviewpoints. There are always multiple identities, which permit learning and adaptation to \nnew environmental demands. Participation is based on pluralism, but permits new \nidentities to grow without being foisted from the outside. \n \nThis amounts to a sophisticated argument combining respect for local knowledges with \nrecognition, indeed support for, change, improvement and development. But can this be \ncombined with any outside viewpoint on well-being? Menon (2002: 164), in a critique of \nNussbaum, questions this: \u2018\u201dSensitivity to context\u201d, if it is to be more than a formula used \nto disguise universalism, must rigorously engage with context and with ideas produced \nwithin that context, even if universalism fails to survive in the process\u2019. Citing Derrida, \nshe claims that there is a violence involved in judging any persons in an idiom they do \nnot share. \n \nTo address this I return to two qualified universal arguments which explicitly reject the \n\u2018view from nowhere\u2019 approach \u2013 the \u2018transitional objectivity\u2019 argument of Charles Taylor \n(1993) and Amartya Sen\u2019s case for \u2018positional objectivity\u2019 (1993).  \n \nTaylor, developing an argument of MacIntyre, assumes a post-modern stance of intense \nmoral skepticism, the belief that moral differences cannot be arbitrated by reason. \nAccepting for the time being that arbitration by externally defined standards is \nimpossible, he claims that transitions between one state and another can still be judged \nas gains or losses. Both he and Sen begin with the less controversial cases of \nobservational, scientific and paradigmatic growth of understanding. The essential basis \nfor describing understanding B as superior to A is that B can explain more and explain A. \nSen, comparing the Indian states of Kerala and Uttar Pradesh, illustrates this by \nexamining the paradox that self-perceived morbidity is higher among groups with lower \nmortality. Building on Marx\u2019s notion of \u2018false conciousness\u2019 he explains that this illusion \nhas an objective basis because declining mortality generates a heightened awareness of \nmorbidity. From his perspective one can understand both the objective reality and the \nillusion. \n \nBut can this apply to moral transitions? Again both Taylor and Sen argue that, in certain \ncircumstances, it can. For Taylor, even where there are diverse and incompatible \nmoralities, there are \u2018resources in argument\u2019. A hidden insight marginally present in all \ncultures (eg. the equal potential intellectual capacity of females and males) can be \nresurrected, fire new demands and challenge previous moral codes. Sen illustrates this \nwith his examination of fine-grained differences of opinion within cultures. Every society \ncontains its dissenters and skeptics. \u2018Arguments invoking cultural relativism typically \noperate on units that are much too gross\u2019. Paradoxically, the more we approach the \nsmallest groups and individuals, the more questionable becomes any notion of a holistic \n\u2018culture\u2019.9 \n \nFurthermore, since systemic and long-lasting moral codes claim consistency, \nparticipatory debate will frequently entail challenging the cosmology in which the broader \ncodes are embedded. One example is the general trend \u2018towards a relatively greater \nrespect for human beings, one by one, at the expense of previously recognized forms of \n                                                 \n9\n This relates to the \u2018multiple identities\u2019 of peasants and other deprived groups in Peru, \ncited by Altimirano et al in this issue of GSP. \n 8 \nsocial encapsulation\u2019. This recognition of \u2018disencapsulated respect\u2019, claims Taylor, is \namong the most painful intellectual transitions for human beings. He concludes  \n\u2018People can and do live human lives in all cultures. To be able to understand this \nsympathetically [ie. Across two or more cultures] \u2026 is to have a truer grasp of the \nhuman condition than that of people for whom alternative ways are utterly \ninconceivable \u2026 the step is an epistemic gain. People may be unhappier as a \nresult, and may lose something valuable that only unreflecting encapsulation \ngives you, but none of that would make this encapsulation any the less blind\u2019 \n(Taylor 1993: 229).  \n \nIn conclusion, there remains a strong argument for a dynamic, positional objectivity in \nconceptualizing and researching well-being. This case is strengthened by the very \nprocesses of globalisation, including cultural interconnectedness and human migration, \nconsidered next. \n  \n \nSOCIAL STRUCTURES \n \nI turn now to the structures within which livelihoods are constructed and reproduced, \nlifeworlds lived, and wellbeing pursued. In the WeD framework we distinguish at least \nfive levels here: the household, the community, the region, the nation and the \nsupranational\/ global. The aim is to understand how individuals are embedded in \nlifeworlds and lifeworlds within \u2018big structures\u2019 (Bevan 2004c). Yet at this level another \nand quite different \u2018story\u2019 dominates today: that of globalisation and homogenisation.  \n \nGlobalisation as a universal trajectory \n \n\u2018Globalisation\u2019 is a protean term. It can encompass increasing global connectedness in \ngovernance, trade, finance, production, migration, communication, culture and the \nenvironment (Held et al 1999). A dominant idea is of increasing convergence, \nhomogenization or isomorphism10 across the globe. I consider here just two \ntheorizations of globalisation: one dominant (economic globalisation) and one more \nsubterranean (world society theory). Both have implications for social policy making and \nfor the improvement of human well-being. \n \nEconomic globalisation embraces the spread of global connections in trade, direct \ninvestment, production, and financial markets. These four elements have appeared in \nroughly this order in the last two centuries of capitalist development, with trade taking off \nin the second half of the 19th century. However, the period from the mid-1980s has \nwitnessed accelerating global integration on all fronts, with further tariff reductions, an \nescalation of foreign direct investment and a notable integration of financial markets. \nOne feature of the present period is the enhanced power of capital compared with that of \nnation states and other actors in civil society such as trade unions. Farnsworth and I \n(Gough 2000, ch.4) argue that this reflects its greater structural power - the ability of \nbusiness and finance to influence policy without applying direct pressure on government \nthrough their agents. This is based on \u2018exit\u2019 rather than \u2018voice\u2019. Such theories have much \nin common with Marx\u2019s Communist Manifesto \u2013 \u2018Marx\u2019s revenge\u2019, according to Desai (  ). \n \n                                                 \n10 Isomorphism: \u2018similarity in shape or structure in unrelated forms\u2019 (Chambers \nDictionary). \n 9 \nOne commonly alleged consequence is the diminishing capacities of nation states. \n\u2018Globalisation\u2019 is notably argued to constrain and undermine national welfare states \nwhere they exist, to stall their development elsewhere, to encourage \u2018social dumping\u2019 \nand to generate a \u2018race to the bottom\u2019. The effects are claimed to operate via lower tax \nlevels, labour standards, social expenditure ratios, coverage of social programmes, and \nincome redistribution.  \n \nIn contrast, world society theory develops a more Durkheimian account, with different \npredicted consequences. According to Meyer et al (1997), global cultural and \nassociational processes construct dominant worldwide models of reality. These cognitive \nand ontological models of reality increasingly shape the practices of actors, including \nnation states, in virtually all domains of rationalized social life. The result is a strong \nisomorphism in domains such as constitutional forms, individualized rights, schooling \nsystems, techniques of economic management, population policies, formal commitments \nto gender equality, and so on. This collective world society is built on a \u2018massive array\u2019 of \ninternational associations, from professional bodies to the United Nations and global \ninstitutions. \n \nOne upshot is that the structures and practices of contemporary nation states are \nincreasingly shaped by this world society. The autonomy of nation states is far less than \ncommonly believed, but the paradoxical result is that the formal capacities of states \nacross the world are expanded \u2013 the opposite to many globalisation arguments. Driven \nby the spread of rationalized models of social reality, promulgated by international \norganizations, national governments become more alike and extensive. However, since \nthese universal policies \u2018helicoptered in\u2019 from above frequently mesh very poorly with the \nreality on the ground, the result is an \u2018extraordinary decoupling\u2019 of policies from \nimplementation at grass roots level. For example, the standardized international model \nof schooling may not be efficient or functional in rural Africa. The enhanced capacities of \nstates may not extend beyond the capital city, or even beyond a few ministries and \ninternational hotels therein (Meyer et al 1997). \n  \nThough very different, these theorizations of globalisation have one thing in common: \nthe prediction of growing homogenization or isomorphism. Yet, both can and have been \ncriticized. The evidence supporting economic globalisation, at least in its impact on \nNorthern states, is remarkable by its absence (see Garrett, Swank etc). The conclusion, \nrather, is that economic globalisation pressures are usually mediated by domestic and \ninternational institutions, interests and ideas. This argument has been developed in \nrelation to the advanced capitalist countries of the North, for example in the work of \nScharpf (2000), Rieger and Leibfried (2003) and notably Swank (2002). Now it is \nappearing in research into social policy reform in the transitional countries (eg Katherine) \nand the developing world (eg Mesa-Lago 2000 on Latin America and Gough 2001 on \nEast Asia).11 \n \nReal social formations are not so simple nor so malleable. More useful here, we would \nargue, is a middle-range conceptualisation of institutions and regimes. To move to the \nopposite extreme and succumb to a purely local analysis would be to accept \nincomparable experiences and lifeworlds. Criticising the modern enthusiasm for local or \nin-group history, Hobsbawm writes:  \n                                                 \n11\n Though Deacon (2003a) still doubts that this applies to poorer and least developed \neconomies. \n 10 \n\u2018History needs mobility and the ability to survey and explore a large territory, that \nis to say the ability to move beyond one\u2019s roots. That is why we cannot be plants, \nunable to leave their native soil and habitat\u2026 in-group history written only for the \ngroup (\u2018identity history\u2019) \u2013 black history for blacks, queer history for homosexuals, \nfeminist history fro women only, or any kind of in-group ethnic or nationalist \nhistory \u2013 cannot be satisfactory as history\u2026 No identity group, however large, is \nalone in the world\u2019 (2002: 415-417).12  \n \nFurthermore, the paradoxical counterpart to this worship of the local is the domination of \nthe current hegemonic worldview and policy portfolios of the most powerful global \nplayers. Today these are the USA, the major international financial institutions, the \nleading intergovernmental groups (WB, IMF, WTO) and the G7. My second goal in this \npaper is briefly to sketch an alternative middle-range theory of big structures. \n \nDiversity, middle-range structures and regimes \n \nMiddle-range approaches are of course not new. From an anthropological perspective \nMary Douglas (1987) has developed her model of four world-views. She distinguished \ngroups (collectivities incorporated into bounded units) from grids (collectivities \ncircumscribed by externally imposed prescriptions and ego-centred relations). Her \napproach has been developed and systemised by her followers in \u2018cultural theory\u2019 (see \nThompson, Ellis and Wildavsky 1990). The group-grid analysis generates four \nfundamental \u2018ways of life\u2019 according to the strength or weakness of each: individualism (-\n\/-), hierarchy (+\/+), egalitarianism (+\/-) and fatalism (-\/+). These functional systems \ngenerate both patterns of social relations and perceptions, preferences and beliefs; \nindeed, it is the ability of a way of life to generate the practices, values and beliefs to \nlegitimate its patterns of social relations that ultimately determines its viability. Change \ncomes when a way of life cannot deliver on the expectations it has generated. The result \nis a \u2018constrained relativism\u2019: different ways of life can coexist and persist but they come \nin only four basic shapes. \n \nA different perspective, modern-day institutionalism, appears in a variety of disciplinary \nguises including historical institutionalism, sociological institutionalism, public choice \neconomics and institutional economics, and I do not survey them here. Yet they have \nseveral things in common: technology and preferences are conceived of as endogenous \nto economic systems, the neoclassical assumption of equilibrium is replaced with the \nidea of agents learning and acting through real historical time, structural uncertainty \nimposes on actors a reliance on routines and habits, durable patterns of behaviour which \ndefine social institutions; social processes are characterised by long periods of continuity \nor \u2018path-dependent\u2019 development punctuated by rapid breaks or institutional shifts. This \nparadigm also directs our attention to the institutional contrasts between different \neconomic systems or forms of capitalism (Gough 2000, ch.2).  \n \nFrom this perspective, Helliwell (2002) documents the abiding reality of national \neconomies in a globalising world. He identifies \u2018strong border effects\u2019 in the fields of \ntrade, finance and migration. These are explained in terms of networks, norms and \ninstitutions (whether or not these are lumped together under the term \u2018social capital\u2019). It \nis true that modern technology and decreasing costs facilitates cross-border networks \n                                                 \n12\n It goes without saying that this condemnation applies as much to the male, white, \nWestern history in opposition to which these group histories emerged. \n 11 \nand linkages, but  \u2018the scale of these is still dwarfed by the density of local contacts and \ncommerce\u2019 (Helliwell 2002: 74). One result is that the quality of national institutions \nimpacts strongly on general life satisfaction when comparing countries. Distinct national \neconomies persist in a globalising world and so too does the need for distinct national \neconomic policies. \n \nThe same applies to social policy. A more recent attempt by a group of us at Bath to \ndevelop a middle-range structural framework for understanding well-being in developing \ncountries has radically extended the \u2018welfare regime\u2019 concept of Esping Andersen(1990; \nGough and Wood et al 2004). This neo-institutional approach attempts to steer a middle \nway between teleological or functionalist approaches (both modernisation and Marxist) \non the one hand, and post-modern approaches emphasising uniqueness and diversity \non the other hand. A welfare regime is at the most general level an institutional matrix of \nmarket, state and family forms, which generates welfare outcomes. We consider that it \noffers a powerful framework for studying social policy in development contexts for four \nreasons. First, the welfare regime approach is concerned with the broader \u2018welfare mix\u2019: \nthe interactions of public sector, private sector and households in producing livelihoods \nand distributing welfare: a dominant theme in the development literature. Second, it \nfocuses not only on institutions but outcomes \u2013 the real states of well-being or ill-being of \ngroups of people. Third, it is a \u2018political economy\u2019 approach which embeds welfare \ninstitutions in the \u2018deep structures\u2019 of social reproduction: it forces researchers to \nanalyse social policy not merely in technical but in power terms. Fourth, it enables one to \nidentify clusters of countries with welfare features in common; it holds out the promise of \ndistinguishing between groups of developing countries according to their trajectory or \npaths of development.  \n \nTo undertake this task we first redefine welfare regimes in a more generic way to refer to \nall institutional arrangements, policies and practices affecting welfare outcomes and \nstratification effects in diverse social and cultural contexts. Within this, we then \ndistinguish three broad families of regimes: welfare state regimes, informal security \nregimes and insecurity regimes. A welfare state regime describes a set of conditions \nwhere people normally meet (to varying extents) their security needs via participation in \nlabour markets and financial markets and via the finance and provisioning role of a \n\u2018welfare state\u2019. An informal security regime describes a set of conditions where people \nrely heavily upon family, community and parton-client relationships to meet their security \nneeds, to greatly varying degrees. These relationships are usually hierarchical and \nasymmetrical and result in problematic inclusion or adverse incorporation, whereby \npoorer people trade some short-term security in return for longer-term vulnerability and \ndependence. At the extreme, an insecurity regime describes a set of conditions which \ngenerate gross insecurity and block the emergence of stable informal mechanisms to \nmitigate, let alone rectify, these. These regimes arise in areas of the world where \npowerful external players interact with weak internal actors to generate conflict and \npolitical instability. Insecurity regimes are rarely confined within national boundaries.  \n \nUsing this framework we then identify more specific regime types in different zones of \nthe world: mixed liberal-informal welfare regimes in Latin American countries outside the \nCaribbean; productivist welfare regimes in East Asia, informal security regimes in South \nAsia; and a generalised insecurity regime in much of Africa. Further research would \nreveal more fine-grained patterns. We contend that the welfare regime framework moves \nforward the analysis of social policy and human welfare in development contexts.  \n \n 12 \nTo conclude, the common element in all these approaches is that they undermine \nnarratives of homogenization and in their place stress diversity and path dependency. \nThey can form a bridge between universalizing and localizing accounts of the world in \ngeneral and of social structures impacting upon human well-being in particular. \n \n \nSOCIAL STRUCTURES AND HUMAN WELLBEING \n \nTwo conclusions can be drawn from the above. First, contrary to post-modernist and \nrelativist thinking, dynamic, positional, yet objective judgements can be made about the \neffects on human well-being of changes in circumstances. By these standards individual \nwellbeing increases with the expansion of meaningful choices \u2013 when the bounds of \n\u2018unreflecting encapsulation\u2019 are loosened.13 Second, macro structures still matter, but \nthey are more open and varied than the discourse of hegemonic globalisation allows. \nGiven path dependent development and inherited institutions \u2013 given in other words the \ncombined and uneven development of history \u2013 there is a larger repertoire of institutional \nconfigurations and policy options than either globaphiles and globaphobes allow. Do \nthese conclusions enable the contradiction identified in the introduction to be reconciled \nor at least diminished? Let me answer this at three levels: individuals, lifeworlds and big \nstructures. \n \nIndividuals and critical autonomy \n \nLet us begin by comparing empirical studies of the components of well-being in different \nlocales with those identified in universal lists such as those of Nussbaum and Doyal-\nGough (see Clark and Gough 2004). Such comparisons reveal much overlap, first \nbetween different countries and communities and second, between these and more \nuniversalizing lists. The common \u2018labels\u2019 which emerge as desirable facets of well-being \ninlcude material resources, bodily well-being, social well-being, security, psychological \nwell-being and freedom of choice and action. Yet there are differences, and one \nimportant example concerns education and learning. For example, the Voices of the \nPoor study found that knowledge was not generally considered as a good-in-itself, \nthough human capital in an instrumental sense was recognized (Narayan 2000; Alkire \n2002:63). Clark (2002:136-139) reports a similar finding in his study of human values in \nSouth Africa. Yet this contradicts many philosophical accounts of well-being which \nemphasise the intrinsic, extrinsic and constructive importance of learning; universal lists \nof well-being which all include items like understanding, culturally relevant knowledges, \nand literacy; and well-known indicators such as the Human Development Index which \nincludes two measures of knowledge acquisition as central components. \n \nI would claim that the discrepancies broadly centre on what we have termed \u2018critical \nautonomy\u2019. Critical autonomy entails the capacity to situate the form of life one grows up \nin, to criticise it and, if necessary, to act to change it. This requires two things: individual \ncapacities to exercise critical agency and social preconditions that provide opportunities \nfor the exercise of critical agency. Without a measure of critical autonomy, local \n                                                 \n13 Though subjective well-being may not be improved. Individuals who exert more critical \nautonomy and challenge community norms may suffer from ostracism and lowered \nSWB. \n \n 13 \nconceptions of well-being cannot be challenged. This applies whether the \u2018local\u2019 \nconceptions are articulated by individuals or groups.  \n \nThis is to challenge purely individual, subjective, \u2018hedonic\u2019 notions of wellbeing. One \nstrong reason for doing so is the pervasive propensity of people to adapt to changes in \ntheir life circumstances, well documented in the psychological literature though the terms \nvary and include \u2018adaptive preferences\u2019, \u2018hedonic adaptation\u2019, \u2018the hedonic treadmill\u2019 or \n\u2018response shift\u2019 (eg. Frederic and Loewenstein, 1999, Camfield and Skevington, 2003, \nCummins and Nistico 2002). This ability to adapt would appear to be a ubiquitous \nfeature of the human condition and applies to individual misfortunes (debilitating illness) \nand gains (windfalls and raises), and to collective misfortunes (natural disasters) and \nimprovements (economic growth and prosperity). All of them confound any simple \nreliance on SWB and hedonic subjective quality of life scores when making intra-\npersonal comparisons or comparisons over time.  \n \nThis is recognised in an alternative psychological theorisation of eudaimonic  wellbeing \ndeveloped by Ryan and Deci (2001). Building on Maslow and Fromm, Ryan and Deci\u2019s \nself-determination theory identifies basic psychological needs which provide a universal \nfoundation underlying the human actions studied by hedonic psychology. The three \nbasic needs identified are autonomy, competence and relatedness. There is no space \nhere to develop this theme, but the parallels between this philosophy and psychology of \nwell-being and the objective approach in A Theory of Human Need are immediately \nobvious.  In particular, their theory supports the priority we give to autonomy, and agree \nwith us that this refers not to independence, or non-reliance on others, as is often \nclaimed by critics, but to self-regulation and volition, the recognition that acts are \nundertaken by you, not done to you (see Sheldon 2001, Chirkov et al 2003). Camfield \nand Skevington (2002: 29), who make a similar comparison, consider that \u2018Doyal and \nGough\u2019s claim [about the centrality of autonomy] is supported by nearly three decades of \nresearch and assessment of the conceptual cluster of control, choice and mastery\u2019. \nFurthermore, the need for competence embraces several other components of \nautonomy in THN (Doyal and Gough 1991:.59-69), including cultural understanding, \ncognitive skills, self-esteem, and elements of critical autonomy. There is here a \nremarkable convergence between psychological need and human need theory. \n \nCultures and lifeworlds \n \nCulture can be perceived as both a resource and a context for social action. Livelihoods \nanalysis has developed the idea of a portfolio of resources, including material, human \nand social resources (Carney 1998). In turn the Resource Profiles Approach extends this \nby including cultural resources (Lawson et al 2000; McGregor, this issue). A culture here \nis a set of norms, values and rules develop by a particular community in relationship to a \nparticular natural and social environment, which generates meanings for people within \nthat community. It is a resource insofar as it \u2018contains\u2019 durable solutions to problems \nwhich those individuals and collectivities face. However, this approach also recognizes \nthat such identities are multiple and the \u2018solutions\u2019 contested, notably in mobile and \nmigrant populations within the peripheral zones of capitalism. As Figueroa et al (1996) \nargue, deprived people can be culturally excluded via labeling, or have little choice but to \ntrade down to despised identities in order to secure their basic needs (see also \nAltamirano et al this issue).  \n \n 14 \nThis dynamic and contested view of cultural identities is more congruent with the \narguments for a more fine-grained interpretation of culture argued above. Critical \nautonomy requires participatory debate with some members exposed to alternative \npoints of view and external experiences. \u2018External\u2019 here refers to any frame of reference \noutside that of the group being studied. All the contributors to the earlier discussion of \nthe \u2018local-upwards\u2019 resolution to the universal-local dilemma agree that some kind of \ninter-cultural discussion should be fostered in order to arrive at ethically justifiable and \npractically workable conceptions of the good. This requires what we term \u2018cross-cultural \nlearning\u2019. Thus a more contextual concept of \u2018culture\u2019 does not rule out some testing, \nevaluation and reform of cultural practices, invoking external viewpoints. The choice is \nas much between critics and upholders of the dominant local culture as between \nuniversal and local conceptions of well-being.14 \n \nGlobalisation and the universal \n \nGlobalisation as a power discourse is very different from universalism as a normative \ndiscourse, and I begin with the former. The contemporary form of \u2018incomplete\u2019 \nglobalisation is shaped by the most powerful actors in the world system. Today these are \nthe USA, the leading intergovernmental groups (WB, IMF, WTO) and the G7, the major \ninternational financial institutions and leading transnational corporations. This remains \ntrue despite the frequent framing of these international discourses in terms of human \nrights. The rights are often framed in too specific, one-size-fits-all (OSFA) terms \u2013 the \n\u2018single sustainable world model\u2019 identified in the US National Security Strategy. Thus \ndemocracy is equated with forms of legal democracy or competitive elitism as they have \nemerged in the West (Held 1996). Thus social rights, where recognized, tend to be \ninterpreted in terms of state-delivered, justiciable, formal rights. Real-world social \nstructures are heavily dominated by a hegemonic Washington-dominated elite with its \nown self-serving agenda. In this light, cultural diversity and relativism can be interpreted \nas a form of resistance from below, as argued by the G3, G20 and G77 (Deacon) and \nmembers of the anti-globalisation movement. Part of the disconnect identified at the start \nof this paper can be explained in these terms. \n \nYet this is too simple and sits uneasily alongside the contemporary view of the end of the \nWashington consensus (Stiglitz, 1998; Gore 2000) or of Deacon\u2019s (2003b) portrayal of \n                                                 \n14\n The news is replete with cases where local cultural practices conflict with notions of \nuniversal human needs and rights held by some (and more than a handful of) people \nwithin the cultural system concerned. Consider for example, two headlines in the \nGuardian in May 2004: \u2018Village council approved rapes: A village council in Pakistan \npermitted a landlord to rape the sister and sister-in-law of a man he accused of an illicit \nrelationship with his daughter, police said yesterday\u2019. Also \u2018Execution nears for mentally \nill Texas killer\u2019. Both actions were challenged: the first by police in the nearby town of \nKabirwala, the second by civil rights groups in Texas and the US. In another example, \nNjoya (2002) discusses the dilemmas faced in Kenya by the current constitution on \n\u2018customary law\u2019. All new laws are subject to customary law unless they are \u2018repugnant to \njustice or morality\u2019. However, the dominant cultural ideology rules out any such appeal, \neven in cases of genital mutilation or denying married women\u2019s right to inherit property. \nGroups opposed to these cultural practices have had recourse to two external \ndiscourses: \u2018colonial\u2019 law (the 1882 British Married Women\u2019s Property Act) and global \ndiscourses on rights.  \n \n 15 \ndiversity, fragmentation and disunity in current debates and alliances around global \nsocial policy. The Bretton Woods institutions disagree with the United Nations \ninstitutions, there are divisions within the UN family of organisations, the G7 are opposed \nby the G3, the US neo-liberal model is contested by the EU social liberal model, while \nthe US currently opposes any form of global social levy or extension of global social \nrights. Deacon refers to the \u2018check-mate\u2019 at governmental and inter-governmental levels.  \n \nThis emerging dispute and variety has the merit of challenging OSFA policy \nprescriptions \u2013 there is no longer a \u2018single policy size\u2019 whether in economic, social, \nenvironmental or other policy areas. There are signs that this is slowly being recognized \nwithin leading international institutions. For example, the World Development Report \n2004: Making Services Work for Poor People, seems to recant past mistakes and claims \nthat \u2018no one size fits all\u2019. Instead it develops an extensive case that \u2018eight sizes do\u2019. This \ndivides countries according to whether politics are pro-poor or clientelist, whether \npopulations and thus service clients are homogenous or heterogenous in their \npreferences, and whether the particular services are hard or easy to monitor. The first \ndistinction is evidently simplistic, according to our analysis of informal security regimes. \nYet, the Report does indicate a process of learning from mistakes and a recognition of \nthe huge importance of context in understanding the delivery and impact of services \n(and by implication other need satisfiers) at the local level. \n \nFurthermore, Deacon (  ) and some other supporters of a socially responsible globalism \nargues that this diversity strengthens the need for a \u2018solid ethical reference point\u2019 to \narbitrate the various positions of \u2018actors in practice\u2019. We thus return to the case for an \nethically attractive universalism around which consensus can be built. If the powerful are \nnot to determine this, then the struggles to rationalise world governance advocated by \nGSP are of urgent importance. To succumb to cultural or post-modern relativism would \nsimply leave open the field to the most powerful global forces. \n \nThe earlier arguments about diversity, regimes and path dependency perhaps point to a \nresolution of the original contradiction in terms of regimes and regions. Our regime \napproach enables us to combine a universalism about ends with a relativism about \nmeans. We conclude that there is a moral hierarchy of regime types, from insecurity \nregimes to informal security regimes to formal security regimes. Yet in proposing and \nsupporting policy measures within a medium term timeframe (say within the lifetime of \nthe Millennium Development Goals) we must be sensitive to history, globalisation and \npath dependency. Relativism of means entails considering a wide repertoire of policy \nmeasures and a wide range of actors in the public domain, not confined to the state \n(Wood and Gough 2004).  \n \nIn practice, this may well entail intermediate regional actors and institutions coupled with \na concept of multi-tiered, international welfare systems (Deacon 2001). Room (2004), for \nexample, extols the lessons of the most successful regional organisation, the European \nUnion, where growing economic integration has fostered moves towards \u2018multi-tiered \ngovernance\u2019 and social interventions. If applied to Southern regional groupings, this \nwould entail a substantial range of measures including regular monitoring of social \nstandards and policy-targets, resource transfers on the basis of regional or global \ntaxation or levies, mechanisms for cross-national policy learning and exchange of best \npractice, and new institutional arrangements for shared governance. These are \nambitious goals, which are far from secure even in the EU. Yet they could potentially \n 16 \nprovide an institutional framework enabling policy-learning to take place across regions \nwith a broadly similar socio-economic and cultural context.  \n \nSuch a dual strategy can begin to resolve the contradiction with which I began. Regional \nand regime-specific actors and institutions can provide social models and policy learning \nbetter moulded to national and local realities than Washington- or Geneva-based global \ninstitutions. They can also enhance the voice of peoples and groups within the South. \nThe combination of these with participatory policies to involve the poor can avoid \nuncritical subjugation to cultural norms while nourishing alternative social policies. \nTogether, they can begin to challenge post-modern relativism about goals and OSFA \nglobal norms concerning means. It may reinvigorate the vision of common human needs \ncoupled with local contestation over need satisfiers. \n \n 17 \nBibliography \n \nAlkire, Sabina (2002) Valuing Freedoms: Sen\u2019s Capability Approach and Poverty \nReduction.
