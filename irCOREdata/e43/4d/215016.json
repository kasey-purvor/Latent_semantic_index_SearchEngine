Methods: Randomised controlled trial comparing usual care plus CRT with usual care alone. Participants had a diagnosis of schizophrenia and cognitive and social functioning difficulties. Health\/social care and societal costs were estimated at 14 weeks (time 2) and 40 weeks (time 3) after randomisation. The outcome, proportion of participants improving their working memory since baseline, was combined with costs to explore cost-effectiveness. Results: 85 participants were recruited. There were no differences in total health\/social care or societal costs between the two groups at either time 2 or time 3. An additional 21% of participants in the CRT group improved their working memory at both follow-ups. When placing these cost and outcomes in hypothetical scenarios concerning how much policymakers would pay for another 1% of participants improving their working memory, there was more than an 80% chance that CRT would be cost-effective compared to usual care; at time 3, the likelihood of cost-effectiveness peaked at 30% even for investments up to \u00a35000. Conclusions: CRT can improve memory among people with schizophrenia and cognitive deficits at no additional cost. Although cost-effective in the short term, CRT may have limited potential to save costs in the medium term because it could increase take up of services.
