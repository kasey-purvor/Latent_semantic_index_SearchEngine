Ideology (as reflected in material cul-\nture and monument building) changed abruptly. To achieve the\nrequired decoupling, subsistence is therefore portrayed as having\nchanged slowly. This implies three things: (1) Mesolithic foragers\nwere gradually intensifying their subsistence economy. (2) Neo-\nlithic people subsisted mainly on wild animals and plants and\nwere nomadic. (3) Subsistence change across the ideological tran-\nsition was slow, continuous, and seamless. Many other scholars,\nalthough not post-processualists, have come to accept these three\npoints. But as the post-processual view has become the consen-\nsus, the data from Britain, Ireland, and southern Scandinavia\nhave all been leading in the opposite direction: (1) There is no\nreason to think that Mesolithic foragers were intensifying eco-\nnomically. (2) Neolithic people subsisted mainly on cultivated\nplants and domestic animals and were fully sedentary. (3) The\ntransition to agriculture was rapid and probably traumatic. The\ncurrent consensus has yet to incorporate these data into its ex-\nplanatory framework.\np e t e r ro w l e y - c o n w y is Reader in Environmental Archae-\nology at the University of Durham (South Rd., Durham DH1\n3LE, U.K. [p.a.rowley-conwy@durham.ac.uk]).

In the past 15 years a new interpretation of\nthe transition to agriculture, largely a product of the Brit-\nish post-processual school of archaeology, has been at\nleast partially accepted by many scholars not normally\nconsidered post-processualist and, although contested in\nparticular areas, achieved a status close to consensus. In\nthis contribution I will argue that this interpretation is\nflawed. It arose in opposition to previous interpretations\nand as a result has taken up a problematic theoretical\nposition. I will argue that the data have unequivocally\nmoved in a different direction and that ignoring or over-\nlooking these data renders the current consensus unten-\nable. Northwestern Europe needs a new understanding\nof its Neolithic.\n\u201cNeolithic\u201d has meant many things. As defined by\nLubbock (1865:2\u20133), it was purely technological, refer-\nring to the polishing of stone artifacts. By the twentieth\ncentury it had broadened to include sedentary village life,\ncereal agriculture, stock rearing, and ceramics, all as-\nsumed characteristic of immigrant agriculturalists (e.g.,\nChilde 1957). In the late 1960s, reflecting the ecological\ninterests of the \u201cnew archaeology,\u201d it narrowed again to\nrefer just to the agricultural mode of subsistence (e.g.,\nHiggs and Jarman 1969).\nIn the late 1980s, with post-processual archaeology,\nthe meaning shifted again. The Neolithic came to be\nconsidered an ideological phenomenon, a new \u201cstructure\nof ideas\u201d (Thomas 1988:65; Tilley 1996:72) or \u201cway of\nthinking\u201d (Bradley 1998:20; Edmonds 1999:6) manifested\nas a change in material culture\u2014principally the con-\nstruction of ritual and funerary monuments from ca.\n4000 BC (dates are calibrated). From this perspective, the\nsubsistence economy is no more \u201cfundamental\u201d than\nother aspects of culture, and therefore ideology cannot\nbe viewed merely as \u201csuperstructure\u201d (e.g., Thomas\n1991:7\u20138).\nThis approach creates an agenda which may be decon-\nstructed as follows: If ideology and subsistence change\nat the same time, subsistence may still be the funda-\nmental engine driving change. For many scholars the\ntask is therefore to separate subsistence from ideological\nchange: if material culture change is not synchronized\nwith subsistence change, it must reflect a purely ideo-\nlogical change that outweighs anything economic. Sub-\nsistence change is portrayed as slow while change in\nTrobe University), Newcastle upon Tyne, Poona (Deccan College),\nSt. Louis (Washington), Sydney, and Uppsala, at Magdalene College\n(Cambridge), and at the National Museum of Denmark (Roskilde).\nI am grateful for the feedback these experiences provided.

The current view of change in economy and material culture at the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition in\nNorthwestern Europe (modified from Thomas 1997:fig. 1 and 1999:fig. 2.1). The change in material culture is\nmore usually placed at or just after 4000 b.c.\nmaterial culture is abrupt (fig. 1). Subsistence cannot\ntherefore have influenced material culture. This effec-\ntively insulates ideology from the taint of economic\ncausation.\nSlow subsistence change makes three things axiomatic\nin the current consensus: (1) Before the ideological\nchange, the Late Mesolithic was intensifying economi-\ncally towards domestication. (2) After the ideological\nchange, the Neolithic diet still came mainly from no-\nmadic hunting and gathering. (3) Across the ideological\nchange, subsistence change was seamless as local Mes-\nolithic groups gradually adopted agriculture. I will con-\ntest all three.\nThe current consensus is largely British in origin. Brit-\nish scholars from Lubbock (1865) to Whittle (2003) have,\nhowever, used evidence from Denmark to support their\narguments because the Danish record is better-re-\nsearched. More recently, Ireland and southern Sweden\nhave also produced impressive archaeological records,\nand Scandinavian and Irish scholars have of course joined\nin the debate. This contribution will therefore consider\nevidence from Ireland, Britain, Denmark, and southern\nSweden (fig. 2). All four are partly coastal and acquired\nagriculture at about the same time, ca. 4000\u20133900 BC\u2014\nmuch later than the interior of temperate Europe at ca.\n5500 BC.\nAn Intensifying Mesolithic?\nAxiom 1 requires subsistence intensification in the Late\nMesolithic. Despite this, Mesolithic material culture did\nnot change: no monuments were constructed. If Neo-\nlithic monuments resulted from ideas not economy, then\nthe absence of Mesolithic monuments must similarly\nresult from an idea\u2014or lack of one.\nThe argument is developed as follows: Criticism is\nadvanced of suggestions (e.g., those of Case 1969 and\nLegge 1989) that monument construction required a\nlarge agricultural population (see, e.g., Bradley 1993:9;\n1998:10; Thomas 1997:60; 1999:8). Other cultural\ntraditions are invoked to demonstrate that hunter-gath-\nerers could build monuments if they chose to; the Pov-\nerty Point, Adena, and Hopewell monuments in North\nAmerica are cited as built mainly by foragers (Bradley\n1993:11\u201313), while even at Cahokia the role of agricul-\nture is minimized (Thomas 1991:19\u201320; 1999:23). The\nupshot is the claim that Mesolithic monument construc-\ntion was not demographically impossible but \u201cliterally\n. . . unthinkable\u201d (Bradley 1998:34).\nThe North American analogues are dubious. Cahokia\nwas undoubtedly based on intensive maize agriculture\n(Lopinot 1997). There was significant cultivation of na-\ntive domesticated plants back to the early first millen-\nnium AD at least (Fritz and Smith 1988, Lopinot 1997,\nSimon 2000). At Poverty Point in the second millennium\nBC, agriculture played little or no role (Gibson 1998,\nWard 1998), but the site lay in an area of tropical lakes,\nswamps, and watercourses which were hugely produc-\ntive: its ca. 1,300-km2 hinterland contained between 5\nand 175 tons of fish per km2 (Gibson 2000:166). The wa-\nterways were difficult to overexploit because they were\nrestocked annually by the flooding of the Mississippi,\nand many other species of animals and plants were also\navailable. This environment, aptly described as \u201ccor-\nnucopian\u201d (Gibson 2000:164), was unlike any in Meso-\nlithic Europe. Even Danish Late Mesolithic people, set-\ntled on a productive coast, probably achieved nothing\nlike the Poverty Point population density, while British\nand Irish densities were probably even lower. This se-\nriously weakens the argument that because one group of\nforagers did build Poverty Point, all foragers could have.\nrowley-conwy Reconsideration of Agricultural Origins F S85\nFig. 2. The Northwest European areas discussed, showing the locations of sites mentioned in the text.\nThe uniqueness of the Poverty Point environment sug-\ngests that in Europe monument construction was indeed\nimpossible without an agricultural population as Case\nand Legge suggested.\nBut was the Northwest European Mesolithic intensi-\nfying its subsistence economy? If so, population density\nmay have been increasing towards the point where mon-\numents were achievable. Many do favour Late Meso-\nlithic intensification (e.g., Bradley 1998:23; Price 1996:\n352; Thomas 1996b:315; 1997:59; and in Scandinavia\nBlankholm 1996:128\u201332; Gr\u00f8n 1997, 1998; Nash 1998:\n3\u201316). Some argue that domestication of indigenous wild\nanimals and plants was occurring (D. L. Clarke 1976;\nPetersson 1997:184\u201385; Richmond 1999:7\u20139; Zvelebil\nS86 F current anthropology Volume 45, Supplement, August\u2013October 2004\n1994, 1995)2 or that wheat was being cultivated on a\nsmall scale (Bradley 1993:19; Go\u00a8ransson 1995:62\u201364;\nJennbert 1984; Price 2000:276; Tilley 1996:86).\nThe idea of Mesolithic intensification is part of a wider\ndebate about hunter-gatherer intensification in general.\nSome hunter-gatherer variability may have an ecological\ncontext. For example, dense coastal populations would\nexploit local resources more intensively simply because\nof the larger human population (Rowley-Conwy 2004);\nthis statement is probably uncontroversial. The debate\nis over whether intensification might occur without\nsuch an ecological context, for example, in the Late Mes-\nolithic as a trend towards agriculture. This kind of in-\ntensification is argued to take place for two reasons: pop-\nulation increase or internal social development.\nPopulation increase for non-ecological reasons relies\non early hunter-gatherers\u2019 maintaining an artificially low\npopulation, increasing only much later\u2014the \u201cslow-track\noption\u201d (Mulvaney and Kamminga 1999:132\u201333). Some\nargue that hunter-gatherers often do this (e.g., Hayden\n1972; Lourandos 1997:15\u201317). However, Boone (2002)\nshows that contemporary hunter-gatherer fertility rates\nare similar to those of farmers. Long periods of apparent\npopulation stasis in prehistory therefore actually com-\nprise alternating increases and crashes invisible to ar-\nchaeology. Hunter-gatherer and farmer populations thus\nhave equal capacity to increase; what differentiates farm-\ners is the crash-buffering role of agriculture (Boone 2002).\nBut hunter-gatherers below carrying capacity would be\nsimilarly buffered by plentiful resources. They could\ntherefore increase their population just as rapidly as\nfarmers\u2014the \u201cfast-track option.\u201d But would they? \u201cCul-\ntural controls\u201d might keep population low, but this sug-\ngestion treats the group rather than the individual as the\nunit of selection. Individuals who ignored \u201ccultural con-\ntrols\u201d would gain a huge evolutionary benefit by filling\nthe underpopulated landscape with their descendants,\nand hunter-gatherers would probably not be able to po-\nlice a slow-track demographic policy (Rowley-Conwy\n2001:47). Population increase separated from ecological\nfactors is therefore not a likely cause of intensification.\nInternal social development is often invoked as the\nother non-ecological cause of intensification. Hodder ad-\nvances the domus (Latin for \u201chouse\u201d) as \u201ca metaphor for\nthe domestication of society\u201d in contrast to the agrios\n(from the Greek for \u201cfield\u201d) \u201cwhich means wild, savage\u201d\n(1990:41, 86). Before animals and plants could be do-\nmesticated, society itself had to become domesticated;\n\u201cthe domus provided a way of thinking about the control\nof the wild\u201d (p. 39), and \u201cit was through the domus that\nthe origins of agriculture were thought about and con-\nceived\u201d (p. 38). The domus is thus a necessary inter-\nmediate stage between agrios-type hunter-gatherers and\n2. I have been surprised to see myself quoted by Richmond (1995:\n5), Thomas (1996b:314; 1998:47), and Zvelebil (1995:86; 1996:334).\nas claiming domestic cattle and\/or pigs in the Danish Late Meso-\nlithic. This appears to result from insufficiently close reading; I\ntake this opportunity to stress that I have never made such claims\nand have indeed always argued against them (Rowley-Conwy 1995,\n2003a).\nagriculturalists. Domus societies are characterized by\nsedentism, food storage, and hierarchy (Hodder 1990:37),\nalso attributes of Woodburn\u2019s (1982) \u201cdelayed-return\u201d so-\ncieties. Hodder treats these societies diachronically, do-\nmus\/delayed-return groups developing from agrios\/im-\nmediate-return ones. His formulation can, however, be\ncriticized as progressivist, implying unidirectional global\ncultural evolution, some societies just being ahead of\nothers. One unavoidable outcome is the implication that\ncontemporary agrios-type societies like the San, Hadza,\nor Aborigines are locked into a pre-domus state of irre-\ndeemable and archetypal \u201cwildness,\u201d a suggestion with\nwhich many contemporary anthropologists might disa-\ngree. The archaeological and anthropological hunter-\ngatherer records in fact reveal flexibility rather than pro-\ngress: societies may change rapidly towards either domus\nor agrios strategies, depending on local circumstances.\nIt is therefore more useful to consider these strategies\nsynchronically, emphasizing variability rather than di-\nrectional change (Keeley 1988, Rowley-Conwy 2001). So-\ncial flexibility and rapid non-directional change make up\na preferable non-progressivist alternative.\nThere are therefore theoretical problems with both\npopulation increase and internal social development as\ncauses of intensification in the European Late Meso-\nlithic, and certainly such intensification cannot be as-\nsumed. If it is to be accepted, it must be on the basis of\nthe archaeological evidence. The British Late Mesolithic\nhas actually provided very little relevant evidence of any\nkind; this is one of those cases mentioned above in which\nNorthwestern Europe as a whole relies heavily on the\nevidence from Denmark and southern Sweden.\nIntensification of the collection of wild plants has been\nsuggested (D. L. Clarke 1976, Zvelebil 1994), but it is\nunlikely that any kind of indigenous agriculture was\nemerging as a result. Many of the plants discussed by\nClarke are unsuitable for such treatment (Rowley-\nConwy 1986:27\u201328). Acorns and hazelnuts occur on\nMesolithic sites, but there is no evidence that their col-\nlection increased through time; they are not annual\nplants and are unlikely to form the basis for a quasi-\nagricultural system. There is very little evidence for the\ncollection of appropriate small-seeded annuals and none\nfor their cultivation (Rowley-Conwy 2004).3\nIntensified exploitation and perhaps local domestica-\ntion of animals is sometimes suggested, for example, for\nred deer (Jarman 1972). Cervids, however, are territorial\nduring the mating season and do not form fixed-mem-\nbership herds, which makes them behaviourally unsuit-\nable for domestication (Rowley-Conwy 1986:26). Jar-\nman\u2019s suggestion was based on sex ratios obtained from\nantlers at Star Carr, which indicated a cull heavily biased\ntowards males. The antlers were, however, collected for\nworking and did not reflect the actual sex ratio of the\n3. A few grass species native to Europe, for example, Elymus\narenaria, have pollen grains as large as those of cultivated cereals.\nThis is, however, an intrinsic characteristic of these grasses and\nhas nothing whatever to do with their being cultivated in the Mes-\nolithic; cultivation would not have altered pollen size (contra Zve-\nlebil 1994:50).\nrowley-conwy Reconsideration of Agricultural Origins F S87\nred-deer cull at Star Carr; males and females were killed\nin about equal numbers (Legge and Rowley-Conwy 1988:\n48\u201358).\nCattle lived wild in Europe, but the domestic forms\nwere probably imported rather than indigenously do-\nmesticated. Two significant sites have a few domestic\ncattle bones in a largely wild fauna: Ferriter\u2019s Cove in\nIreland is Late Mesolithic (Woodman, Anderson, and Fin-\nlay 1999:90), while A\u02dakonge on the Danish island of Zea-\nland is transitional to the Early Neolithic (Gotfredsen\n1998:96\u201397). These are significant because wild cattle\nwere present on neither island; these specimens were\ndefinitely imported. In both cases the individuals were\nidentified as small domestic rather than large wild ani-\nmals. This pattern recurs in areas where wild cattle were\npresent; the substantial size difference between wild and\ndomestic argues against local domestication because\nthere are no transitional ones (Rowley-Conwy 1995,\n2003a). Initial results from ancient DNA support the im-\nport hypothesis: there is a considerable genetic difference\nbetween prehistoric British aurochs and modern domes-\ntic cattle (Troy et al. 2001).\nMesolithic control of wild boar has been suggested be-\ncause \u201ca tame pig or two would act as an efficient con-\nverter of surplus food\u201d (Zvelebil 1995:86). However, wild\npigs function in exactly the same way, with the added\nadvantage that people do not have to feed them through\ntimes when no surplus food is available. It is rather dif-\nficult to see what niche a tame boar would have occupied\nin a Mesolithic society without agricultural plant waste\nor stubble fields. Zvelebil states that pig bone frequencies\non Mesolithic sites increase through time, but no such\ntrend is visible in his figure 8. He further suggests (p. 96)\nthat winter killing and healed shot wounds indicate\n\u201cclose contact\u201d between pigs and humans. The clearest\nMesolithic winter site is Ringkloster in Denmark, which\nis a hunting camp from which joints of pork were ex-\nported\u2014a classic logistic hunting strategy which has\nnothing to do with controlling the animals (Rowley-\nConwy 1998a, Rowley-Conwy, Halstead, and Collins\n2002). The healed shot wounds testify to close contact\nwith arrows rather than with swineherds. Finally, Zve-\nlebil (pp. 94, 95) states that there was selection for more\njuvenile pigs in the Late Mesolithic. Age data from nu-\nmerous Mesolithic sites in Denmark and southern Swe-\nden (fig. 3) show variability but no time trend; some of\nthe highest proportions of juveniles occur in the Early\nMesolithic, probably because the sites were occupied in\nsummer when juveniles are particularly numerous (Row-\nley-Conwy 1993). Pigs were transported to Ireland in the\nMesolithic, but this does not mean that they were do-\nmestic. The planting of wild animal populations on is-\nlands for hunting purposes is widely attested; in Neo-\nlithic Europe, red deer were taken to Corsica and\nSardinia, fallow deer to Cyprus, and marsupials to New\nBritain as early as 19,000 years ago (Vigne 1988, Davis\n1984, Flannery and White 1991). Metrical evidence sug-\ngests that domestic pigs were actually introduced at the\nstart of the Neolithic (Rowley-Conwy 1995, 2003a).\nThere is, then, no good evidence for the intensified use\nof native plant or animal species. What of the claims for\nLate Mesolithic wheat cultivation? This non-native ce-\nreal would have to have been obtained from Neolithic\nfarmers to the south. Grains of pre-Neolithic cereal pol-\nlen are occasionally found, but their identity and status\nmust be treated cautiously (Innes, Blackford, and Row-\nley-Conwy 2003). Actual cereal grains have not been\nproven in Mesolithic contexts. Three grain impressions\nin \u201cMesolithic\u201d pottery from Lo\u00a8ddesborg in southern\nSweden are often said to demonstrate Mesolithic culti-\nvation (Price 2000:276; Tilley 1996:86; Zvelebil 1996:fig.\n18.6), but the sherds all postdate a radiocarbon deter-\nmination falling at the very end of the Mesolithic (Jenn-\nbert 1984:62\u201363). The Mesolithic and Neolithic pot-\nsherds were intermingled throughout the sequence and\nvery hard to separate typologically (p. 49), while at other\nsites Neolithic pottery is always found stratified above\nMesolithic pottery. Scandinavian scholars universally\nmistrust Lo\u00a8ddesborg, considering it a deeply disturbed\nsite (M. Andersson 2003:74; Kristiansen 1993:248; M.\nLarsson 1984:169; Malmer 2002:16; Madsen 1986:235; P.\nO. Nielsen 1985:121 n. 31; Persson 1999:45\u201346), some-\nthing also suggested by the Iron Age C14 dates it has\nyielded (Jennbert 1984:62\u201363).\nIn summary, the Late Mesolithic was not progressing\ntowards agriculture. There are no theoretical grounds for\nintensification without an ecological context, and there\nis no archaeological evidence that intensification was tak-\ning place. Large permanent settlements actually appear in\nsouthern Scandinavia in the Middle Mesolithic, for eco-\nlogical reasons: sea-level rise brought productive environ-\nments to the region (Rowley-Conwy 1999:137\u201340; 2001:\n54\u201356). Therefore axiom 1 of the current consensus is not\nsupported.\nA Foraging Neolithic?\nAxiom 2 requires Neolithic subsistence to have been\nbased mainly on wild resources. According to Thomas\n(1993:388), for example,\nDomestic resources, both animal and plant, had an\nimportance in Neolithic Britain which was primarily\nsymbolic. They were deployed in ritual, exchange\nand feasting . . . . Neither played a major part in\nfeeding people from day to day, and these people\nwere, from an economic point of view, still formally\nMesolithic.\nDomestic plants and animals are here portrayed as part\nof the Neolithic \u201cidea\u201d rather than of the Neolithic econ-\nomy. The current consensus plays down the economic\nimportance of cultivated plants and domestic animals.\nIt also stresses settlement mobility and the absence of\npermanent domestic buildings.\ncereal agriculture\nThe limited importance of cereal agriculture in the Brit-\nish Neolithic is generally accepted (e.g., Bradley 1993:\nS88 F current anthropology Volume 45, Supplement, August\u2013October 2004\nFig. 3.

Samples are\noften small and diverse, usually containing a minority\nof cereal grains; hazelnut shell is often more frequent,\nand wild apple\/pear and weed seeds are also common\n(fig. 4, A). If these samples are interpreted at face value,\ncereal cultivation was indeed a minor aspect of British\nNeolithic diets. The situation is not so straightforward,\nhowever. Macrobotanical items go through a variety of\npathways to reach the archaeological record, and con-\nsideration of this is essential before samples can be in-\nterpreted. Interpreting the activities that produced the\narchaeology is, however, an exercise in middle-range the-\nrowley-conwy Reconsideration of Agricultural Origins F S89\nFig. 4.

Middle-range theory\nis closely linked to the \u201cnew archaeology\u201d and has been\nwritten off by post-processual archaeology because it ig-\nnores the uniqueness of each cultural context. \u201cThere\ncan be no universal cultural relationship between statics\n[the archaeological record] and dynamics [the activities\nthat created the record]\u201d (Hodder 1986:116).\nIt is one thing to criticize the theoretical underpin-\nnings of middle-range theory. It is quite another to as-\nsume that the problems middle-range theory sought to\naddress have therefore gone away. Yet this is the current\nBritish consensus position: denying itself a methodology\nfor interpreting macrobotanical samples, it has no alter-\nnative but to \u201clet the data speak for themselves.\u201d The\ninevitable outcome is the conclusion that hazelnuts\nwere more important than cereals in the Neolithic diet.\nOthers nevertheless do consider the complexities of the\nsamples. Hazelnut shell is robust and survives charring\nwell. It occurs in quite large fragments that are visible\nduring excavation, which is rarely the case for cereal\ngrains. The visible presence of nut shell is sometimes\nthe reason a botanical sample is collected in the first\nplace. For this reason alone, hazel is likely to be over-\nrepresented, but there are others. Cereal grains were usu-\nS90 F current anthropology Volume 45, Supplement, August\u2013October 2004\nally intended for consumption, so their preservation by\ncharring happened only by mistake. Hazelnut shell frag-\nments, however, had no further uses and could be dis-\nposed of\u2014or may actually have been used as kindling.\nHazel is thus much more likely to be preserved and re-\ncovered and hence to be overrepresented in the archae-\nological record (Jones 2000, Legge 1989, Monk 2000).\nWild apple and\/or pear may be relatively common for\na specific reason: the establishment of a forest clearing\nwould in due course have created a \u201cmantle vegetation\u201d\naround its edges, a semi-natural hedge separating the\nclearing from the forest. Such a mantle would for eco-\nlogical reasons have contained many fruit-bearing spe-\ncies such as apple and pear\u2014and also hazel (Groen-\nman\u2013van Waateringe 1983, Monk 2000). These fruits\nmay therefore be a by-product of agricultural settlement.\n(This of course assumes that the clearing was fairly long-\nlasting; this will be discussed below.)\nWeed seeds may not have been collected for food but\nprobably do result from the processing of crops for hu-\nman consumption. Ethnographic studies of wheat and\nbarley processing have revealed a multistage process.\nEach cultural context may be unique, but there is really\nonly one way these crops can be cleaned. The process\ninvolves threshing, then winnowing to remove light-\nweight waste, coarse sieving to remove contaminants\nlarger than cereal grains, fine sieving to remove smaller\ncontaminants, and hand cleaning to remove contami-\nnants of the same size. The crop is usually threshed,\nwinnowed, and coarse-sieved before being stored; fine\nsieving and hand cleaning are often done on a daily basis,\nprior to grinding (Hillman 1981, Jones 1984). Fine sieving\ngenerates a waste product made up of small weed seeds\nand chaff fragments that in recent times formed ideal\nhen food\u2014but there were no chickens in Neolithic Eu-\nrope. There was no obvious use for this waste product,\nwhich would often have been thrown on the fire, where\nit was charred and preserved. Hearths are commonly\nsampled for macrobotanical remains, so it is not sur-\nprising that such waste products are common. Well-sam-\npled sites may produce both waste products (burnt de-\nliberately) and cleaned grain (burnt by accident), as at\nScord of Brouster (Milles 1986) (fig. 4, B). (This site is in\nthe Shetland Islands, too far north for hazel or apple\/\npear.)\nTaphonomic considerations thus suggest that hazel,\napple\/pear, and weeds may all be overrepresented com-\npared with cereals. The observed pattern is in fact con-\nsistent with a cereal-based economy represented largely\nby its inedible waste products, supplemented by wild\nfruits and nuts. This would be a legitimate conclusion\nregarding the samples in figure 4, A, even in the absence\nof major cereal finds. Major cereal finds have, however,\nturned up. Some of these are from ritual monuments, for\nexample, Hambledon Hill in Britain (Legge 1989) and\nSarup in Denmark (N. H. Andersen 1999; fig. 4, C). These\nindicate the symbolic use of cereals proposed by Thomas\nand therefore might not mirror the domestic economy.\nOne other category is, however, very important: cereal\nfinds from burnt buildings. Three are currently known\n(fig. 4, D). They probably represent material in store\nwhen the building was burnt, because the roof space of\nsuch structures would have formed an ideal storage en-\nvironment (Rowley-Conwy 2000).\nThe current consensus does not, however, reflect the\nevidence of these important samples. Some have sought\nto separate this evidence from the domestic sphere and\nlocate it entirely in the area of ritual. Thomas (1999:25)\nargues that the structures \u201crepresent specialised storage,\nconsumption or redistributive locations for a very special\nkind of food, rather than simply farmsteads\u201d (see also\n2003:71). Richmond (1999) seeks to exclude cereals from\ndomestic contexts entirely: pollen sites suggestive of cul-\ntivation are \u201cspecial areas within the social and eco-\nnomic framework of crop utilisation\u201d; the burnt struc-\ntures indicate \u201cfood storage rather than occupation\u201d;\ncooking evidence \u201ccomes from sites which were not used\nfor occupation\u201d; and ceramics with cereal impressions\nmay have been \u201cimported, indicating that the grain im-\nprints are foreign to the sites\u201d (pp. 32, 12, 33). Rich-\nmond\u2019s conclusion is that \u201cthe available data indicate\ncultigen presence, but not necessarily actual cultivation.\nUpon the majority of sites where crops have been sug-\ngested there is little or no proof of agriculture\u201d (p. 33).\nThe conclusion derives mainly from the a priori as-\nsumption that Neolithic diets were based mainly on wild\nfoods and that agricultural products belong in the ritual\nsphere. Cultivation, storage, and cooking are, however,\nclassic domestic activities, and the evidence is best in-\nterpreted as such. Domestic activities may be ritualized,\nbut cereals are equally nutritious whether or not their\nconsumption has ritual overtones. Ritual is best re-em-\nbedded in the cultural totality, not used as a denial of\ndomesticity.\nThe argument for mostly wild foods is a particularly\nEnglish one. Few Scandinavians have joined in the dis-\ncussion (perhaps because plant remains receive less em-\nphasis in Denmark and Sweden). Objections have been\nvoiced in the Celtic regions, both Scotland (Barclay 1997:\n141\u201344) and Ireland (Cooney 1997:27; 2000:40\u201341), and\namong archaeobotanists, both dismissable as peripheral.\nBut the archaeobotanical evidence is persuasive, and the\nIrish and Scottish cereal stores (Tankardstown and Bal-\nbridie respectively) date from the beginning of the Ne-\nolithic, suggesting a major role of cultivation from the\nstart of the period. The English evidence is similar: the\nLismore Fields cereal store is likewise Early Neolithic.\nCereal cultivation was probably predominant every-\nwhere in Northwestern Europe from very early in the\nNeolithic.\ndomestic animals\nThe current consensus also plays down the role of do-\nmestic livestock. It is certainly true that major faunal\nsamples are rare for the first few centuries of the Neo-\nlithic. Large samples dating from around 3300 BC come\nfrom Windmill Hill in Britain (Grigson 1965) and Trol-\ndebjerg in Denmark (Higham 1967). Both are dominated\nby domestic animals, but both are ritual monuments.\nrowley-conwy Reconsideration of Agricultural Origins F S91\nThe earliest major faunal sample from a settlement is\nfrom Ra\u00a8vgrav in Sweden, also dating to ca. 3300 BC. Of\nthe large mammals, 97% are domestic and only 3% wild\n(Jonsson, cited in L. Larsson 1992). Samples from earlier\ncenturies are smaller; in Denmark, however, they sug-\ngest a predominance of domesticates from the start of\nthe Neolithic (Aaris-S\u00f8rensen 1988; Koch 1998:243\u201351).\nOnly at Muldbjerg I is there a predominance of wild\nfauna, but this site was on a floating peat island in a lake\nand was probably an outlying hunting camp (Noe-Ny-\ngaard 1995:67\u201369). The situation is similar in Britain:\nwith one exception, none of the Neolithic samples plot-\nted by Thomas (1991:fig. 2.4) has over 15% wild animals.\nThe exception is a single Early Neolithic pit from Co-\nneybury containing the remains of some ten domestic\ncattle, seven roe deer, two red deer, and two pigs. The\nsample accumulated rapidly and may represent a single\nbutchery episode (Maltby 1990), and when meat weights\nare calculated the two deer species provide only 20%\n(Rowley-Conwy 2003b). This is the nearest to a deer-\ndominated Neolithic fauna that Britain can provide.\nDomestic animals were probably predominant from\nvery early on; as with cereal agriculture, there is no sign\nof a lengthy transitional period. Small-scale but intensive\ncattle management has long been argued by Legge (1981),\nwho uses the animals\u2019 age and sex parameters to argue\nfor dairy production in Britain and for meat production\nin Denmark. Dairying in Early Neolithic Britain has re-\ncently been supported by the demonstration that some\nceramics contained dairy products (Copley et al. 2003).\nManure may also have been important as a fertilizer. A\ncow produces between 9 and 14.5 tons of manure per\nyear (McConnell 1897:116\u201317), and Neolithic cultivators\nwould surely have recognized its efficacy.\nstable isotopes in human bone\nStable isotope analysis is an increasingly useful way of\nexamining prehistoric diets independently of the animal\nbone and plant evidence. Stable carbon in bone13(\u0001 C)\nvaries with the ratio of marine to terrestrial foods con-\nsumed (C4 plants are similar to marine foods in this\nrespect, but there were none in Neolithic Europe). Early\nwork undertaken in Denmark (Tauber 1981, 1982)\nshowed a remarkably rapid shift from mainly marine\nfoods in the Late Mesolithic to mainly terrestrial foods\nin the Early Neolithic, suggesting a rapid shift to an ag-\nricultural diet. This rapid shift conflicts strongly with\nthe slow subsistence change currently envisioned, and\ntherefore doubts have been raised about the technique\n(Whittle 1996:229). A potential source of error is that\nmost of Tauber\u2019s Mesolithic individuals were coastal\nwhile his Neolithic ones came from the interior, with\nthe result that the shift could be geographical rather than\nchronological (Bailey and Milner 2003). Several recent\nstudies have addressed this problem by sampling coastal\nNeolithic individuals, and they uniformly show that\neven in coastal regions people ate a mainly terrestrial\ndiet from early in the Neolithic. This is true for the\ncoasts of southern Wales (Schulting and Richards 2002a),\nwestern Scotland (Schulting and Richards 2002b), Ireland\n(Woodman n.d.), eastern Denmark (Richards and Koch\n2001), and western Sweden (Sjo\u00a8gren 2003). The complex\nhistory of the Baltic Sea makes determinations in this\narea more problematic, but there is a clear shift towards\na terrestrial diet in southern Sweden and O\u00a8land (Lide\u00b4n\n1995) and on Gotland (Lindqvist and Possnert 1997).\nThomas (2003) seeks to cast the dietary change in Brit-\nain as part of the Neolithic cultural package by arguing\nfor a \u201ccultural prohibition on marine foods . . . or taboo\u201d\n(p. 70). This goes beyond what the isotopic evidence can\nshow, however: predominance of marine or terrestrial\nfoods can be demonstrated, but total dietary exclusion\nof either cannot. Conventional archaeology reveals that\nmarine foods certainly were exploited in the Neolithic.\nIn the Orkneys, marine molluscs and offshore fish were\nexploited at Knap of Howar (Evans and Vaughan 1983,\nWheeler 1983) and Skara Brae (D. V. Clarke 1976). Farther\nsouth in Scotland there are large Neolithic shell middens\nat Nether Kinneil and elsewhere (Sloane 1986), as there\nare at Culleenamore in Ireland (O\u00a8sterholm and O\u00a8ster-\nholm 1984). Ireland has other evidence for Neolithic ma-\nrine exploitation (Woodman n.d.), and in Denmark there\nare both large marine fish traps like that at Oleslyst (Ped-\nersen 1997) and settlements with fish bones (Enghoff\n1991). These are all far from southern England, but they\nare the regions from which the isotope data come. The\ncase for a total taboo in Britain is therefore not strong;\na predominantly terrestrial diet is as much as we can\ncurrently demonstrate.\nIt has been postulated that the Neolithic terrestrial\nfoods might have been wild rather than domestic (Tilley\n1996:96; Thomas 2003:69), but this is very unlikely: the\ninterior supported relatively few Late Mesolithic hunter-\ngatherers and would not have been able to sustain the\nmuch larger Neolithic population without a predomi-\nnantly agricultural economy. The isotope evidence thus\nsupports the argument that there was a rapid transition\nto agriculture at the start of the Neolithic.\nsettlement patterns\nMost Late Mesolithic coastlines round Britain and Ire-\nland are now underwater, so a comparison between Late\nMesolithic and Early Neolithic settlement patterns can-\nnot be effectively undertaken. In most of Denmark and\nsouthern Sweden, however, coastal areas are now above\nwater, and settlement patterns across the transition can\nbe examined. Throughout this area, settlement pattern\nshows an abrupt shift to the interior at the start of the\nNeolithic. In southern Sweden, \u201cthe settlement pattern\nwas radically altered, and the emphasis shifted from the\ncoast to the inland areas\u201d (M. Larsson 1986:244); the\npointed butted axe, characteristic of the earliest Neo-\nlithic, has a markedly inland distribution (M. Andersson\n2003:fig. 10). Major settlement shifts also occur in Den-\nmark (P. O. Nielsen 1985:115) and on the Baltic islands\nof Bornholm (F. O. Nielsen 1997) and Gotland (O\u00a8ster-\nholm 1989). The shift is rapid, and the earliest Neolithic\nphase is not in any sense transitional; earliest Neolithic\nS92 F current anthropology Volume 45, Supplement, August\u2013October 2004\nfind spots are generally less numerous than those of later\nperiods, but their distribution is the same. This agrees\nwith the isotope evidence and suggests that the transi-\ntion to an agricultural economy was rapid.\nfield systems and water control\nField systems and water control are clear signs of com-\nmitment to agriculture. Richmond (1999:33) states that\nthere is \u201can almost total absence of field system or water\ncontrol evidence\u201d in the British Neolithic. Early field\nsystems are, however, unlikely to survive, because later\ncultivation will usually erase the earlier traces. One Ne-\nolithic field system does, however, survive\u2014a 2.5-ha ar-\nrangement in association with the settlement at Scord\nof Brouster, well-sampled for its botanical remains (Whit-\ntle et al. 1986). This site is not exactly in the breadbasket\nof Britain, so other areas may be expected to have had\nlarger systems which have not survived.\nOne much larger system is known, the Ce\u00b4ide (formerly\nBehy-Glenulra) field system in western Ireland. This sys-\ntem comprises co-axial stone walls covering in excess of\n12 km 2 and has survived because blanket peat grew over\nit, protecting it from later depredations. The larger fields\nwere probably for livestock, although smaller enclosures\ncould have been for arable and contained settlements\n(Caulfield 1983). If such a huge system was Neolithic, it\nwould demonstrate the importance of agriculture and\nthreaten the current consensus. There has therefore been\na tendency to suggest that the Ce\u00b4ide fields are poorly\ndated (Thomas 1996a:4), belonging to the end of the Ne-\nolithic (Richmond 1999:33). There has never been any\ngood reason to suggest this. The earliest publication\nquotes a C14 determination older than ca. 3000 BC (Caul-\nfield 1978). More recently a series of dates has shown\nthat the peat had already covered the fields by ca. 3100\nBC (Caulfield, O\u2019Donnell, and Mitchell 1998). How\nmuch earlier than this the fields were originally con-\nstructed is unknown, but they certainly date from early\nin the Neolithic. Cooney (1997:28) mentions several\nother Irish cases that may be similar. Field systems are\nlikely to have been widespread across the better agri-\ncultural areas of Britain and southern Scandinavia as\nwell, but they have not survived the subsequent millen-\nnia of tillage.\nWater control systems are not known in Britain or\nIreland. Spodsbjerg in Denmark, however, has a Neo-\nlithic dam some 12 m in length surviving to a height of\n60 cm. It consists of four parallel log walls held between\nretaining posts; its construction is dated by dendrochro-\nnology to just after 3000 BC. It was next to a large set-\ntlement and created a substantial pool probably for wa-\ntering cattle (S\u00f8rensen and Bech 1998).\nard furrows\nArd furrows have been found on the original land surface\nbelow burial monuments. The earliest British find comes\nfrom beneath the South Street long barrow, dated to ca.\n3500 BC (Evans, cited in Ashbee, Smith, and Evans 1979).\nMany cases are known from Denmark; Thrane (1989:fig.\n4) plots 12 (and one more in Sweden) from the period\n3200\u20133500 BC. Earthen long barrows are older than this,\nbut ard furrows have not been found beneath them\n(Thrane 1989), a conclusion which still holds good today\n(P. O. Nielsen, personal communication). Ard furrows\nunder burial mounds could have been part of funerary\nritual (Rowley-Conwy 1987); if so, the ard might have\nbeen present earlier but not used in such rituals, but at\nthe moment an Early Neolithic pre-ard phase a few cen-\nturies long is plausible. It has been suggested that such\nard furrows played a purely ritual role and need not in-\ndicate cultivation (Thomas 1999:24). This, however, re-\nmoves them from the broader Neolithic context: what-\never the status of the furrows beneath the mounds, they\nreveal that the ard was present, and it is inconceivable\nthat it was used only for funerary rituals. The ard testifies\nto a considerable commitment to agriculture. Oxen must\nbe fed and trained over a long period, a substantial in-\nvestment. Use of the ard indicates that fields of some\nsize were being cultivated, which in turn suggests sub-\nstantial arable production.\nnomadic settlement\nPart of the argument for a mainly foraging Neolithic is\nthat settlement was nomadic not sedentary. Whittle\n(1997:22) argues for a nomadic settlement pattern until\nthe Middle Bronze Age (see also, e.g., Bradley 1998:53;\nEdmonds 1999:17\u201319; King 2001:327\u201330; Pollard 1999;\nPollard and Reynolds 2002:31; Richmond 1999:10\u201315;\nThomas 1991:14\u201319; 1999:29; Whittle 2003:40\u201343). Once\nagain, fewer Scandinavians have concurred, and the ar-\nguments for Neolithic nomadism there have come\nmostly from outside (Hodder 1990:184; Price 1996:349;\nWhittle 1996:229; 1997:22), although shifting cultivation\nhas been suggested by Scandinavian scholars.\nIn Mesolithic studies, settlement seasonality has been\na major topic. Mesolithic analyses involve detailed con-\nsideration of as many types of organic evidence as pos-\nsible. Northwest European examples include Mount San-\ndal in Ireland (Woodman 1985:156\u201368), Star Carr in\nBritain (Legge and Rowley-Conwy 1988, Mellars 1998),\nRingkloster in Denmark (Rowley-Conwy 1998a), and\nSkateholm in Sweden (Rowley-Conwy 1998b). Such\nanalyses have not been undertaken for the Neolithic,\npartly because suitable samples are scarce. As a result,\nthe Neolithic discussion is based on less satisfactory ar-\nguments. Three aspects will be considered here: shifting\ncultivation, houses and settlement, and coppicing.\nShifting cultivation is commonly suggested for both\nBritain (e.g., Whittle 1999:64) and southern Scandinavia\n(e.g., Jensen 2001:258). The suggestion is based on the\nagricultural typology of Boserup (1965), which assumes\nthat the earliest agriculture will be a \u201clong-fallow\u201d type\nwith forest clearance and burning, one or two years\u2019 cul-\ntivation, and then some decades of forest regeneration;\nintensification involves progressively shortening the fal-\nlow and increasing labour input (e.g., by ploughing, ma-\nnuring). Ard furrows imply longer-lived fields, but, as\nrowley-conwy Reconsideration of Agricultural Origins F S93\nmentioned above, evidence for the ard does not go back\nto the earliest Neolithic. It is sometimes assumed that\nshifting cultivation is the only alternative to permanent\nard-based agriculture (Barrett 1994:143). However, per-\nmanent and intensively managed fixed plots can be cul-\ntivated with hoe and digging stick (Barclay 1997:142;\nJones 2000:83), and such agriculture has recently been\ndemonstrated for the Early Neolithic of central Europe\nby a close consideration of the associated weed floras\n(Bogaard 2002a).\nIn Britain, shifting cultivation is proposed without the\ncitation of much evidence in support as an incidental\naspect of the nomadic subsistence system based on wild\nspecies. In Denmark the suggestion is based on the de-\ntailed pollen analyses of S. T. Andersen (1992, 1993),\nwhich reveal that the soil forming Neolithic burial\nmounds contains burnt tree pollen and unburnt cereal,\ngrass, and herb pollen, argued to indicate burning fol-\nlowed by cultivation. However, any stratigraphic con-\ntexts in the old soils were lost when they were heaped\nup to form the mounds, and therefore the sequence of\nactivities that gave rise to the pollen is not clear. There\nis no indication that the clearances were cultivated only\nfor a year or two or that there were repeated clearances\nin the same area as would be the case for shifting cul-\ntivation. The main problem facing shifting cultivators\nin Northwestern Europe would have been the seasonal\ndistribution of rainfall, which makes it very difficult to\nburn felled forest at any time except midsummer\u2014but\ncereals would have been planted in either spring or au-\ntumn, and burning at these times of year is rarely pos-\nsible (Rowley-Conwy 2003b). It is much more likely that\nNeolithic cultivation was in fixed plots worked with dig-\nging sticks.\nHouses and settlement are a vexed problem. Many\nsettlements consist of just scatters of pits. In Britain pits\nhave been adopted as evidence for nomadism (e.g., Ed-\nmonds 1999:18; Richmond 1999:11), but the information\nreturn from a pit is limited\u2014in Denmark, excavators of\nsimilar pit scatters have no problem in regarding them\nas sedentary fully agricultural sites, as at Sigersted (P. O.\nNielsen 1985). Houses are almost universally said to be\nrare. \u201cIt appears that across a large area of northwest\nEurope . . . timber houses represented only a minor (if\nrecurring) element of neolithic culture\u201d (Thomas 1996a:\n6; see also Whittle 1996:233\u201334). This argument ap-\npeared first in Denmark (Eriksen and Madsen 1984).\nBradley (1998:3\u20139) discusses the Danish Early Neolithic\nsite of Bark\u00e6r, which produced two structures each 90\nm long. Originally interpreted as longhouses (Glob 1949),\nthey were later shown to be earthen long barrows (Mad-\nsen 1979). Bradley treats this reinterpretation of Bark\u00e6r\nas the symbolic starting point for his discussion of a\nmonument-rich but largely house-free Northwest Eu-\nropean Neolithic. For Britain, Thomas (1999:18) men-\ntions \u201cthe absence of substantial domestic architecture\n. . . until well into the Bronze Age\u201d (also 1991:8\u20139;\n1996a); Pollard and Reynolds (2002:31) describe Neo-\nlithic structures as \u201clight, impermanent affairs\u201d (also,\ne.g., Bradley 1993:8; 1998:3\u20139; Evans, Pollard, and Knight\n1999; King 2001:324; Pollard 1999; Richmond 1999:\n10\u201315; Whittle 1999:63).\nThe current consensus has dealt with the few houses\nit does recognize in the same way as with other conflict-\ning evidence by writing them out of the domestic con-\ntext. We have seen that burnt cereal stores like Balbridie\nare argued not to have been permanently occupied. Oth-\ners are similarly dealt with for even more tenuous rea-\nsons. For example, Richmond (1999:13) doubts the do-\nmestic nature of Lismore Fields because next to the\nstructures are two lines of posts with no obvious func-\ntion; Thomas questions one house because it has too few\nstone tools (1996a:7), another because it has too many\n(pp. 9\u201310). The plain fact is, however, that Neolithic\nhouses in Northwestern Europe are neither flimsy nor\nrare. Recent excavations have revealed a very large num-\nber of structures; reviews may be found in Artursson et\nal. (2003) for Sweden, Darvill (1997) for Britain, Grogan\n(2002) for Ireland, and P. O. Nielsen (1997) for Denmark,\nand even these do not list them all. Many houses have\nreceived only preliminary publications, while others are\ndiscussed in reports with limited circulation.\nMy own list of houses (fig. 5, A) is based on the following\nthree criteria: (1) They must be Early Neolithic; in Den-\nmark and Sweden this includes structures dated to the\nEarly\/Middle Neolithic boundary and earlier but not def-\ninite Middle Neolithic ones even if firmly dated to phase\nIa or ones with vaguer dates such as \u201cEarly or Middle\nNeolithic.\u201d This effectively means that the houses prob-\nably date to ca. 3300 BC or earlier, and this cut-off point\nis used for Britain and Ireland as well. (2) They must have\nreasonably clear plans, so that at least one dimension can\nbe estimated; uninterpretable posthole scatters are ex-\ncluded. (3) Minimum size must be 5 m. The list has no\nfewer than 175 houses (Rowley-Conwy 2003b:table 1); Ire-\nland has 44, Britain 31, Denmark 48, and southern Sweden\n52. If the entire Neolithic had been included, it would\nhave contained several hundred more. They range in size\nfrom the 5-m threshold up to 20 m or more in length.\nBark\u00e6r makes a symbolic reappearance not because of the\ntwo long barrows but because the post holes of the un-\nderlying settlement represent at least two substantial\nhouses (Liversage 1992:pl. 4).\nNorthwest European archaeology has a history of fail-\ning to find houses in a certain period, assuming nomad-\nism, and then finding numerous houses after all. For ex-\nample, the first Bronze Age settlement in Denmark was\nrecognized in 1909, but no house was discerned. For half\na century Danish Bronze Age people were assumed to\nhave been tent-dwelling pastoral nomads; the first long-\nhouse was recognized in 1957 (Thrane 1985), and hun-\ndreds are now known. When the dates of publication of\nthe Early Neolithic houses are plotted, it is clear that\nthe same thing is currently happening for this period (fig.\n5, B). After decades of nervousness and uncertainty, ex-\ncavators have become confident in their recognition of\nthese houses.\nThere are other factors too. Fowler (1981) suggested\nthat many Neolithic landscapes might lie buried beneath\nerosion deposits caused by later agriculture. Thomas\nS94 F current anthropology Volume 45, Supplement, August\u2013October 2004\nFig. 5. A, locations of Early Neolithic houses in Ireland, Britain, Denmark, and Sweden. B, year of first publi-\ncation of individual houses (see Rowley-Conwy 2003b:table 1 for details).\nfinds this suggestion \u201castonishing\u201d (1991:9), but it is per-\nfectly plausible. One of Britain\u2019s largest Early Neolithic\nhouses, White Horse Stone, was in fact found under sev-\neral metres of hillwash (Oxford Archaeological Unit\n2000:453).\nEven more telling is method of excavation, as recent\nwork in Sweden shows (Artursson et al. 2003). Research\nexcavations tend to employ long, narrow reconnaissance\ntrenches; these are widened when a site is encountered,\nbut this widening ceases when artifact density decreases.\nA few Early Neolithic houses have been discovered by\nthis means, but sites generally consist of small scatters\nof pits and artifacts. From this has come the impression\nthat Neolithic settlements are small, around 400\u2013800\nm2, and houses are elusive. In Britain too, archaeologists\nare optimistic that Neolithic settlements can be under-\nstood by this method (e.g., Evans and Knight 2000:94).\nThe antidote to such optimism is Stora Herrestad in\nSweden (fig. 6, A). A research project tested the area in\n1984 using 3-m parallel trenches with 10-m spaces in\nbetween, widened when houses were encountered; no\nEarly Neolithic structures were found (Tesch 1992:fig.\n11). Yet when electrification of a railway necessitated\narea excavation in 1995, a 17-m longhouse of transitional\nEarly\/Middle Neolithic date was revealed adjacent to\ntwo of the earlier trenches (T. Andersson 1997). Area\nexcavation also reveals that Early Neolithic settlements\nmay consist of several functionally distinct areas, each\nrowley-conwy Reconsideration of Agricultural Origins F S95\nFig. 6. A, Stora Herrestad, showing the position of the transitional Early\/Middle Neolithic house and the exca-\nvation trenches (combined and redrawn from Tesch 1992:fig. 11 and T.

B, plan of\nthe Skogsmossen settlement, showing the various activity areas (combined and redrawn from Hallgren et al.\n1997a:figs. 2a, 9b, 11a and b, 17; Hallgren and Possnert 1997:fig. 1; Hallgren et al. 1997b:fig 4.17).\ncreating an artifact scatter of limited size, and therefore\nsome settlements are much larger than is normally sup-\nposed (Artursson et al. 2003). Skogsmossen, from the\nnorthern edge of Early Neolithic farming in Sweden, is\na good example (fig. 6, B). An open-air cooking area of\nhearths and bone debris lay north of a 12.5# 6-m house;\nthree areas of stone packing formed an arc within which\nall but two of the axes were recovered, though all the\nsaddle querns lay outside it; to the east was a small fen\ncontaining votive offerings, and various stone-working\nareas were encountered. The excavators estimate the to-\ntal area of the settlement at between 30,000 and 45,000\nm2 (Hallgren et al. 1997a:100).\nThe distribution of houses (fig. 5, A) is largely an ac-\nS96 F current anthropology Volume 45, Supplement, August\u2013October 2004\ncident of research. Irish gas pipelines and motorway con-\nstruction have produced many. Southern Swedish rail-\nway and pipeline construction and urban development\nround Copenhagen have supplemented major research\nprojects to produce a high density of finds. Central and\nsouthern England, the \u201chome ground\u201d of much of the\ncurrent consensus, has a reasonable scatter. There are\nfewest in northern England and southern Scotland, per-\nhaps symptomatic of the lack of modern economic de-\nvelopment and construction in this region. Early Neo-\nlithic houses are now so common that claims of their\nrarity and non-domestic nature can no longer be sus-\ntained; they cannot all be unoccupied stores for ritual\nuse. Middle and Late Neolithic houses are even more\ncommon. The residential house must be restored to the\ncentre of our understanding of Neolithic settlement in\nNorthwestern Europe. These houses are not Central Eu-\nropean\u2013type longhouses, and more than two or three are\nnot usually found together, but their ubiquitous domes-\nticity cannot be denied.\nCoppicing is a form of woodland management: a tree\nis cut down, and from the stump several new shoots\nrapidly grow. The aim is to produce timber of uniform\ngrowth. Shoots up to 6\u20138 years old are suitable for non-\nsupporting house walls and partitions (the \u201cwattle\u201d of\nwattle and daub), for hurdles to construct fences and\nanimal pens, and for items like fish traps. Some poles\nmay be left to grow for 20\u201330 years if intended for house\nconstruction. If coppiced wood is preserved archaeolog-\nically, it can be recognized by a series of characteristic\nfeatures (Coles 1987:152\u201354).\nSeveral finds are known from Neolithic Northwestern\nEurope. In the Somerset Levels, the Sweet Track is a\nwooden trackway some 1,800 m in length. Its construc-\ntion has been dated by dendrochronology to 3806 BC\n(Hillam et al. 1990), very early in the Neolithic. In ad-\ndition to larger timbers, its construction required some\n6,000 pegs 3\u20138 cm in diameter and 60\u2013210 cm in length\n(Coles and Orme 1984:13). Eleven-year old hazel was fa-\nvoured, and this and other species were coppiced, albeit\nrather unsystematically (Morgan 1984). Many coppiced\nhazel rods were found at Etton (Taylor 1988), and an Early\nNeolithic hurdle from Carr House Sands was probably\nmade of coppiced hazel (Huntley 1997). In Denmark, cop-\npiced hazel was used for a Middle Neolithic trackway at\nTibirke (Malmros 1986) and for a fish trap at Oleslyst\ndated to 3200 BC (Christensen 1997). In Ireland, Early\nNeolithic and later trackways at Corlea were made of\ncoppiced hazel (Moloney 1996).\nCoppicing is important because it implies sedentism\n(Tomii 1996). Browsing mammals find the young shoots\ntasty, so areas of coppice must be fenced (requiring even\nmore coppice) and patrolled to keep out deer and wild\nboar. A group returning after an absence would be un-\nlikely to find its coppices intact. The potential depre-\ndations of animals and other people require continuous\npresence that cannot be reconciled with a nomadic set-\ntlement pattern.\nIn summary, the Neolithic was neither nomadic nor\ndependent mainly on wild foods. There must have been\nlocal variability in settlement and subsistence, but the\narchaeological record remains rather coarse-grained and\nreveals surprisingly little variation; there is at the mo-\nment no reason to single out any one area, for example,\nsouthern England, as different from the others. The var-\nious lines of evidence presented above reveal a sedentary\nNeolithic that acquired the majority of its food from ag-\nriculture. Agricultural clearings were probably small and\nscattered but must have represented substantial infra-\nstructural investment. Quite apart from the felling and\nclearing of forest, each would have contained one or more\nhouses and small but intensively cultivated fields. In\ntime, mantle vegetation would have grown round the\nedge, providing nuts and fruits. Animals were kept close\nto the settlement. Cattle, probably in fairly small num-\nbers, were intensively managed for dairy products in Brit-\nain and for meat in Denmark. Pigs foraged on and around\nthe settlement; because little interbreeding with wild\nboar took place, it is apparent that they were not exten-\nsively run in the forest (Rowley-Conwy 2003a). This re-\nquired yet more infrastructure: fencing to keep them out\nof the cultivated fields, an important feature in contem-\nporary societies keeping pigs like this (Steensberg 1980:\n111\u201323). Substantial areas of coppiced woodland were\nneeded. The ard, requiring dedicated oxen, soon supple-\nmented the digging stick; field size and agricultural pro-\nduction increased. Wild animals and plants were ex-\nploited but only as minor supplements. Axiom 2 of the\ncurrent consensus is therefore not supported.\nA Seamless Transition?\nAxiom 3 is that local Mesolithic groups chose gradually\nto adopt agriculture. The slow economic transformation\nwas thus an internal development within a cultural\ncontinuum.\nIndigenous agricultural adoption is almost universally\naccepted. The slow economic change envisaged by the\ncurrent consensus implies unbroken cultural continuity,\nthe only rapid change being the start of monument build-\ning. According to Thomas (1996b:317),\nAreas such as Britain, Ireland and southern Scandi-\nnavia were not \u201cacculturated\u201d by existing agricul-\ntural populations: their mesolithic groups actively\nchose to engage in new networks of contact and\nnew social and economic practices . . . [so agricul-\ntural origins consisted of] judicious adoption of as-\npects of what the neolithic had to offer.\nThis empowers local Mesolithic groups, making them\nthe determining factor in the appearance of agriculture.\nThis view goes back farther than just the past 15 years,\nhowever: local development was a major tenet of the\n\u201cnew archaeology\u201d (e.g., Higgs and Jarman 1969), and the\nview can be traced to an epoch-making paper by Gra-\nhame Clark (1966). It may not be a coincidence that this\nview arose while Britain was divesting itself of its im-\nperial colonies, a process which was empowering indig-\nrowley-conwy Reconsideration of Agricultural Origins F S97\nenous peoples and re-emphasizing their cultural conti-\nnuity and autonomous choice.\nThe empowerment of the local group as the decisive\nfactor in agricultural origins has questionable implica-\ntions, however. The arguments for Late Mesolithic in-\ntensification towards agriculture imply that these groups\nwere economically progressive. They were not yet ag-\nricultural, however, although other groups in Europe\nwere. Thus all groups are seen as progressing in parallel,\nbut some are ahead. Exotic agricultural items such as\nsheep and wheat are passed on when the next group has\nentered the domus stage of development and can take\nthem on. This is the essence of seamless continuity.\nBut, as we have seen, the change in subsistence econ-\nomy did in fact happen very rapidly. This can be eluci-\ndated using the model developed by Zvelebil and Row-\nley-Conwy (1984, 1986), which identifies three phases in\nthe transition: the availability phase, in which agricul-\nture is available to hunter-gatherers but plays little or\nno role in their economy; the substitution phase, in\nwhich agriculture provides 5\u201350% of the diet; and the\nconsolidation phase, in which agriculture provides over\n50% (see fig. 7, A). The substitution phase is the actual\ntransition, and it is this that was so rapid in North-\nwestern Europe. This is not unexpected, however. Hunn\nand Williams (1982) chart the economic practices of 200\nethnographically known societies. The percentage de-\npendence on gathering (fig. 7, B) shows that many so-\ncieties do not depend on gathering at all. Some societies\ndepend on it for moderate proportions of their diet, while\nvery few are highly dependent. The result is a regular\nfall-off curve. Hunting, fishing, and herding show similar\npatterns. Dependence on agriculture reveals a com-\npletely different pattern. Some societies make little or\nno use of it; these are the hunter-gatherers. Many others\ndepend upon it for 45% or more of their diets, but re-\nmarkably few societies depend upon agriculture for be-\ntween 5 and 45% of their diet. \u201cApparently people either\ndepend upon agriculture to a negligible extent or they\ndepend heavily upon it\u201d (Hunn and Williams 1982:5).\nThis suggests that, other things being equal, the 5\u201350%\nzone of the substitution phase is an unstable interme-\ndiate area through which transitional societies are likely\nto move rapidly. The data may even exaggerate the fre-\nquency of groups in the 5\u201350% zone; many are hunter-\ngatherers in contact with farmers and acquiring some\nagricultural practices from them (Blumler 1996:36), and\ntherefore their numbers have probably been inflated in\nthe past two or three centuries.\nThe scale and rapidity of the economic transition force\nus to reconsider the idea of seamless cultural continuity.\nThe whole economic change took at most a century or\ntwo, and it was the biggest single upheaval that North-\nwestern Europe has ever undergone. Agriculture was an\neconomic juggernaut moving fitfully across Europe and\noverwhelming previous ways of life. Sometimes it\nstopped for centuries at a time, and sometimes it moved\nso fast that we cannot track it with current dating meth-\nods, but ultimately it proved unstoppable until it reached\nthe Atlantic.\nFor the Mesolithic, the arrival of agriculture was an\nunforeseeable contingency, and the upheaval it caused\nmust have been huge. For the successful reproduction of\nlocal forager descent groups, agriculture must have been\na catastrophe. It is almost inconceivable that any socio-\nethnic groups survived intact across the transition. Major\nmovements of people were probably frequent. This is not\nto suggest a return to the demic \u201cwave of advance\u201d sug-\ngested by Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza (1971:687);\nmovements were probably much shorter and less direc-\ntional. Several scenarios can be envisaged, among them\n\u201cleapfrog\u201d migration, taking a group or subgroup just\nbeyond its neighbours into available space, \u201ctrickle\u201d mi-\ngration, involving movement by individuals, not nec-\nessarily of one ethnic group, over periods of a generation\nor more, and \u201ccreep\u201d migration, so slow that it may\nscarcely be discernible within a human generation. Work\non the DNA of modern Europeans has shown that most\nof us are descended from Mesolithic hunter-gatherers,\nleaving room for only a modest immigration from Asia\nin the Neolithic (Sykes 2001). But this work cannot focus\nclosely enough to reveal the type of movements sug-\ngested here. Most of these movements would have been\nby hunter-gatherers or the descendants of hunter-gath-\nerers. European mtDNA lineages would thus remain\nlargely intact, but nothing else would.\nMigrations of the kind considered here are in fact mak-\ning an explanatory comeback in various parts of Europe.\nThe agricultural expansion round the West Mediterra-\nnean coast is a good example (Binder and Maggi 2001,\nZilha\u02dco 2001), and population movements have been sug-\ngested in Britain (Sheridan 2003) and southern Scandi-\nnavia (Skak-Nielsen 2003). For Ireland, Cooney (2000:13)\npoints out that the domestic cattle at Late Mesolithic\nFerriter\u2019s Cove are unlikely to be there because of \u201ca\n[Mesolithic] propensity to take on the importation and\nmanagement of unfamiliar domestic animals\u201d; the peo-\nple who owned the cattle seem more likely carriers (un-\nless the bones arrived in joints of preserved meat).\nThe appearance of agriculture was thus not a demic\n\u201cwave of advance\u201d but rather a rapid and massive soci-\noeconomic \u201cwave of disruption.\u201d Axiom 3, the seamless\ntransition, is not sustainable.\nConclusions\nThe three axioms of the current consensus have been\nexamined and found to be incorrect: (1) The Mesolithic\nwas not intensifying towards a native agriculture. (2) The\nNeolithic was not mainly dependent on wild foods and\nwas not nomadic. (3) The transition was not seamless\nbut highly disruptive. Deconstruction of the post-pro-\ncessual agenda has revealed that subsistence economy\nand ideology had to be decoupled. In the claimed absence\nof abrupt subsistence change, ideology thus became the\ndefault explanation for abrupt cultural change\u2014the\nbuilding of monuments and the emergence of the Neo-\nlithic \u201cstructure of ideas.\u201d As noted in the foregoing,\nobjections have been raised by Scottish and Irish ar-\nS98 F current anthropology Volume 45, Supplement, August\u2013October 2004\nFig. 7. A, phases of the transition identified by Zvelebil and Rowley-Conwy (1984); the S-shaped curve repre-\nsents the proportion of agriculture in the subsistence economy. B, economic reliance on gathering, hunting, fish-\ning, herding, and agriculture in a sample of 200 ethnographic societies (modified from Hunn and Williams\n1982:fig. 3).\nchaeologists, by archaeobotanists, and by isotope spe-\ncialists, but these voices from the Celtic and scientific\nfringes have not had a great impact on this notion.\nThe need to decouple subsistence economy and ide-\nology is, however, the central fallacy of the current con-\nsensus. The overarching theoretical claim is the primacy\nof ideology, which permeates and contextualizes all as-\npects of life\u2014and yet the economy is dealt with in a\ncompletely contrary way. The domesticity of cereal cul-\ntivation, domestic livestock, ard marks, and houses has\nbeen denied. It seems that if settled agriculture can be\nlifted out of the domestic context and placed in a ritual\nrowley-conwy Reconsideration of Agricultural Origins F S99\none instead, this somehow makes it \u201cdifferent\u201d; but of\ncourse the nutritional value of bread and cheese does not\nchange as a result. A further implication is that the\nclaimed (but archaeologically invisible) wild subsistence\nbase is the \u201creal\u201d domestic economy because no ritual\ncontext is argued for it. Ideology has thus been taken out\nof the domestic social context\u2014a remarkable achieve-\nment for an approach that sometimes labels itself \u201ccon-\ntextual archaeology.\u201d\nAdvocates of the current consensus have painted\nthemselves into a corner from which there is no escape\nby theoretical means. Richard Bradley once memorably\nremarked that writings on the Mesolithic and Neolithic\ngave the impression that \u201csuccessful farmers have social\nrelations with one another, while hunter-gatherers have\necological relations with hazel nuts\u201d (1984:11). This oft-\nquoted thought-byte tells only part of the story, however.\nIn essence, the Mesolithic has been treated as a way of\nlife and livelihood, the Neolithic as a way of death and\nritual. We must, however, accept that the Neolithic too\nhad a domestic way of life and that we have many data\ncasting light upon it. We must reincorporate these data\ninto our thinking and make them the starting point for\nour theorizing. As demonstrated above, this generates a\nvery different picture of the past. Until this is accepted,\nNeolithic studies will remain in the theoretical limbo\nin which they currently languish.\nComments\npablo arias\nInstituto Internacional de Investigaciones\nPrehisto\u00b4ricas de Cantabria, Santander 39005, Spain\n(pablo.arias@unicanes). 13 vi 04\nResearch on the introduction of the Neolithic into Eu-\nrope seems to be entering a Kuhnian phase of collapse\nof a consensual model because of its inability to integrate\nnew data. As Rowley-Conwy stresses, the radically in-\ndigenist narrative developed in the 1980s and \u201990s (see\nAmmerman 2002), in which subsistence is considered\nas almost irrelevant compared with ideology, needs pro-\nfound revision.\nCuriously, a central point in the discourse of this post-\nprocessual approach is in fact a legacy of the New Ar-\nchaeology (especially of its British branch): the under-\nstanding of domestication as just one option from among\na broad range of relationships between human society\nand animal or plant species. This is undoubtedly one of\nthe bases of the idea of a gradual change from foraging\nto primitive agricultural systems. If the differences be-\ntween the economic systems fade and are finally con-\nsidered irrelevant, it is logical to look for the source of\nthe Neolithic elsewhere. While the post-processual ap-\nproach inverts the causal agent, the basic concepts are\nprovided by the New Archaeology\u2014which, incidentally,\nmay help to explain the apparent paradox of the success\nof this model among scholars hardly suspected of affec-\ntion for post-processualism.\nTherefore, a key point is whether intermediate situ-\nations between foraging and agricultural systems really\nexist or are simply wishful thinking. This is not, how-\never, a simple question to answer. It may be easy to\nestablish whether cereals were cultivated, but it is dif-\nficult to understand their importance in the diet and in\nthe economy as a whole and their articulation with other\naspects of social life. Similarly, the issue of the mobility\nof Neolithic groups may not be resolved by a somewhat\nsimplistic nomadic\/sedentary dichotomy. Furthermore,\nbecause of the contingency of material culture the in-\nterpretation of the data may not be as straightforward as\nis often assumed. The only possibility of a way out is\nindependent verification. Paleodiet studies, for example,\nare currently providing data that will probably produce\na major change in our knowledge of the transition to the\nNeolithic in Atlantic Europe. From Denmark to Portu-\ngal, stable isotope analyses show a consistent pattern of\nassociation of the beginning of the Neolithic with a sharp\nand rapid change in the diet (Richards, Price, and Koch\n2003; Richards, Schulting, and Hedges 2003; Schulting\nand Richards 2001, 2002a, 2002b; but see Lide\u00b4n et al.\n2004 for a different situation in southern Sweden).\nRowley-Conwy wisely combines these new data with\nan extensive analysis of more conventional archaeolog-\nical information (including firsthand familiarity with the\nScandinavian record) and a sharp methodological critique\nof some of the excesses of the post-processual view. The\nresult is, as a whole, extremely convincing, and I think\nthat this paper will be an important reference for a long\ntime. Yet, it would have been interesting to see him\nexploring the implications of his view of the introduction\nof agriculture a little further.\nThe new scenario that he proposes for the northern\npart of the Atlantic fringe of Europe may in fact have\noccurred at the opposite end as well. On the Atlantic\nfac\u00b8ade of the Iberian Peninsula, it has frequently been\nargued that the introduction of domestic species (espe-\ncially cereals) was very late, but the results of the re-\nsearch of the past ten years seem to be highly consistent\nwith Rowley-Conwy\u2019s proposal for the northern Atlantic\nin its three main points.\nHunter-gatherer intensification has not been clearly\ndemonstrated, even in regions such as the central and\nsouthern Portuguese coast (Arau\u00b4jo 2003); the clearest\nshifts seem to be related to territoriality rather than to\ncomplexity (Arias and Alvarez n.d.). In any case, the\n\u201cbroad-spectrum\u201d Mesolithic economy seems to have\nbeen more a response to shortage than an ecologically\nsustainable adaptation. Moreover, there are now signs\npointing to a rapid and profound change even in areas less\nwell-suited to cereal-based agriculture such as the Can-\ntabrian region and Galicia. The application of flotation\ntechniques has revealed the generalized presence of ce-\nreals since the early Neolithic (sixth or early fifth millen-\nnium, depending on the region), although some data (on\nharvesting without sickles [Iba\u00b4n\u02dcez et al. 2001]) suggest\nthat it was on a small scale. At the same time, archaeo-\nS100 F current anthropology Volume 45, Supplement, August\u2013October 2004\nzoological studies have revealed, even in the north, per-\ncentages of domestic fauna of over 50% in contexts of the\nearly fifth millennium cal BC (Arenaza, El Miro\u00b4n). Indirect\ndata show evidence of dairying in the first half of the\nfourth millennium cal BC (remains of butter in Dombate),\nproving that, as in the Mediterranean basin (Rowley-\nConwy 2000, Vigne 2003), some animal \u201csecondary prod-\nucts\u201d were already used. Finally, carbon and nitrogen sta-\nble isotope values (so far obtained for Portugal and the\nCantabrian region) also seem to confirm the existence of\na sharp change in diet between the coastal hunter-gath-\nerers and the first Neolithic groups, although in the north\nof Spain the evidence for the latter is still insufficient.\nIn short, we are in for some very interesting times in\nthe study of the Neolithic on the Atlantic edge of Europe.\nThe need to include the new data will require significant\nadjustments to our present explanatory models and the\ndrawing of new and more realistic conclusions. It is to\nbe hoped that these new perspectives, of which Rowley-\nConwy\u2019s present work is an excellent illustration, will\nsucceed in integrating many topics introduced into the\ndebate by the post-processual agenda. Approaches like\nthis are not necessarily incompatible with concern for\nthe role of ideology or the complexity of individual ex-\nistence and identity.\nmihael budja\nDepartment of Archaeology, University of Ljubljana,\n1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia (miha.budja@uni-lj.si).\n18 v 04\nDespite many years of modern investigation into the\ntransition from mainly hunter-gatherer (Mesolithic) to\nfarming (Neolithic) societies, it remains an intensively\ndiscussed topic. It is stimulating that comments on pro-\ncessual and postprocessual theoretical views of the tran-\nsition to agriculture have replaced the debate between\ndiffusionists and indigenists. This paper discusses the\nideological and subsistence dynamics and the current\ninterpretations of their correlation that have, as is sug-\ngested, achieved axiomatic status in postprocessual\nviews of the transition in north-western Europe.\nIt is indeed important to draw attention to the con-\nstraints on interpretations of the transition to farming.\nThe first, on an epistemological level, is that we are deal-\ning with processes which cannot be directly observed.\nThe second restricts the empirical importance of expla-\nnations from actual ideological contexts. With regard to\n\u201cmiddle-range theory,\u201d besides taphonomic filters we\nmust not overlook the loop that can be described as \u201cdou-\nble discontinuity\u201d (Klejn 1982), the discontinuity be-\ntween the past and the present and between the material\nworld and the world of ideas, both of which limit the\nvalue of archaeological explanation.\nRowley-Conwy reexamines the theoretical and inter-\npretative postulates and available data on palaeoeconomy,\npalaeodiet, and \u201ccultural continuum\u201d in northwesternEu-\nrope and finds the current decoupling of subsistence econ-\nomy and ideology weak and the related postprocessual\naxioms about the transition to farming incorrect. His com-\nments on Thomas\u2019s model of change in economy and ma-\nterial culture are directed at the premise that fundamen-\ntally new socioeconomic systems appear during periods\nof dramatic cultural change and that stress can be con-\nsidered as a trigger for cultural diversification (see Prentiss\nand Chatters 2003). Paraphrasing Ammerman and Cavalli-\nSforza\u2019s \u201cwave of advance,\u201d he offers an idea of how it\nhappened. He believes that it was catastrophic for local\nforager groups and none survived it intact. The appearance\nof agriculture is recognized as a rapid and massive\nsocioeconomic \u201cwave of disruption\u201d driven by major and\nfrequent movements, local or (inter) regional, of hunter-\ngatherers or their descendants. However, it is broadly ac-\ncepted that there was a stagnant period of 800\u20131,300 years\nin the adoption of agriculture in southern Scandinavia,\nthe British Isles, and Ireland compared with neighbouring\nregions of continental Europe. In the mid-1980s this delay\nwas attributed to a stable maritime-based hunter-gatherer\npalaeoconomy (Zvelebil and Rowley-Conwy 1986). Why\ndid the transition to farming happen when it did, and were\nhunter-gatherers in Britain and Ireland aware of domes-\nticates and novel cultural characteristics before 4000 BC?\nNo answer to this question is offered.\nIt has recently been hypothesized that a shift to a more\ncontinental-type climate shortly after 4100 cal BC, with\nlower winter precipitation and, less critical, higher sum-\nmer temperatures, facilitated the adoption of agriculture\nby indigenous hunter-gatherers in the British Isles and\nsouthern Scandinavia by increasing cereal yields and\nthereby improving the agricultural potential of large areas\n(Bonsall et al. 2002, Bonsall, Anderson, and Macklin 2002).\nOn the North European plain and in Scandinavia, how-\never, it seems that hunter-gatherers were highly selective\nas to which elements of the Neolithic \u201cpackage\u201d they\nadopted from the Bandkeramik farmers to the south.\nIn this respect, it would be instructive to contrast the\nregions within the Atlantic seaboard of Europe (southern\nScandinavia, the British Isles, and the western Iberian\nPeninsula), on one hand, and to compare the \u201cAtlantic\nhalts\u201d with the two that have been hypothesized in the\nCarpathian Basin and on the tip of Balkan Peninsula, on\nthe other. It is not that these \u201chalts\u201d showed either that\nhunter-gatherers had to become \u201cdomesticated\u201d and the\nregions \u201cacculturated\u201d or that the cereals had to adapt\nto new environments but that the intensive nature of\nmixed farming was traceable there from the very early\nNeolithic (Bogaard 2002, 2004). We also should not over-\nlook the regional variability in the genetic palimpsest\nand different values in incoming Near Eastern lineages\nthat are indicated by mitochondrial DNA analysis. Re-\ngional analysis shows the Neolithic contribution\u2014the\nincoming lineages with the values of \u223c20% for south-\neastern, central, northwestern, and northeastern Europe.\nIn the Mediterranean coastal area it is even lower than\n\u223c10%, similar to that in Scandinavia (Richards and Ma-\ncaulay 2000:139\u201351; Richards 2003:159\u201367).\nThe next challenge will be to analyze the relationships\nof changes in economy and material culture in the con-\ntext of transitions from the Natufian varieties of subsis-\nrowley-conwy Reconsideration of Agricultural Origins F S101\ntence, material culture, and monuments to those of the\nNeolithic in the eastern Mediterranean.\ndetlef gronenborn\nRo\u00a8misch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum, Abteilung\nVorgeschichte, Ernst-Ludwig-Platz 2, D-55116 Mainz,\nGermany (gronenborn@rgzm.de) and Johannes-\nGutenberg-Universita\u00a8t Institut fu\u00a8r Vor- und\nFru\u00a8hgeschichte, Schillerstr. 11, Scho\u00a8nborner Hof-\nSu\u00a8dflu\u00a8gel, D-55116 Mainz, Germany (gronenbo@\nuni-mainz.de). 25 v 04\nThis article is one of a number of recent assessments on\nthe rather curious results of postprocessual theorizing on\nNeolithic phenomena. General critiques of a number of\nissues have been expressed before (e.g., Lu\u00a8ning 1999,\nWhitley 2002), and critiques on the specific topic of the\ntransition to farming in northern and northwestern Eu-\nrope have appeared more recently (e.g., Cooney 2003). As\na Central Europeanist archaeologist, I find a number of\ntopics discussed by Rowley-Conwy similar to those be-\ning debated in the circum-Danubian world.\nThese similarities begin with the omnipresent but strik-\ningly old-fashioned debate between \u201cmigrationists\u201d (in-\ntroduction of agriculture attributed to immigrating\ngroups) and \u201cdiffusionists\u201d (farming adopted by local\nhunter-gatherers). The two concepts have enjoyed mu-\ntually exclusive popularity. Many postprocessualists\nworking on the Neolithic have largely dismissed migra-\ntion as an explanatory concept for Central Europe (e.g.,\nWhittle 1996), but for this area in particular any debate\nabout migration versus diffusion must be considered long\noutdated simply because the archaeological evidence for\na combined scenario has been overwhelming for years and\ncontinues to grow (Gronenborn 1999, 2003; Bentley et al.\n2003). Despite this, some scholars still adhere to ideas of\na massive migration (e.g., Bogucki 2003), and others again\ninsist on diffusion and local adaptation as the only plau-\nsible explanation (e.g., Tillmann 1993, Otte and Noiret\n2001). Recent DNA analyses point to minor population\nmovements and a considerable contribution of local ad-\naptation (Richards 2003). Taking all of the archaeological\nand molecular biological evidence into account, both ex-\nclusionary concepts\u2014massive migration and indigenous\nadaptation\u2014have to be abandoned (I find the Indo-Euro-\npean-language debate fostered by Renfrew [1996, 2002]\nand, recently, Gray and Atkinson [2003] too vaguely\nfounded for any serious discussion). Just as Rowley-\nConwy suggests for the British isles, a combination of\nsmall-step migrations with comparatively small numbers\nof people moving into previously underexploited ecolog-\nical niches (e.g., the loess zones of Central Europe) seems\nto fit best. Farming techniques then spread from these\npioneer settlements to the neighboring indigenous groups,\nwhich gradually become acculturated until they are\nscarcely visible in the archaeological record. Thus, ide-\nology does play a role in the spread of farming, but in\ncontrast to what some colleagues would like us to believe,\nit is closely tied to the incoming economy and the incom-\ning people.\nWhat has been equally contemplated by Central Euro-\npean scholars and is linked to the migrationist-versus-\nindigenist debate is the concept of an \u201cintensifying Me-\nsolithic.\u201d For instance, Tillmann (1993) and Kind (1998)\nhave proposed a trajectory toward increasing complexity\nin the later millennia of the Mesolithic. However, in Cen-\ntral Europe, too, these theoretical concepts have little to\ndo with actual data. To date there is no archaeological\nevidence for complex hunter-gatherer societies apart from\nthe Iron Gates region at the far southeastern margin of\nthe region. What one might be inclined to infer from the\ndisappointingly sparse evidence is a tendency towards\nsedentism and increased and intensified long-distance\nexchange (Gronenborn 1999). Whether the proposed but\nnot proven spread of cereal horticulture during the seventh\nmillennium cal BC (e.g., Jeunesse 2003) would have re-\nsulted in a sociopolitical shift is not evident from the\ncurrently available archaeological record, and the possible\noccasional keeping of wild boars in southwestern Ger-\nmany (Steppan 1993) would not account for any increasing\ncomplexity. The only visible changes come with the ap-\npearance of La Hoguette pottery and a pastoral component\nin western Central Europe after 5800 cal BC, but even\nthen population densities may still have been low, with\nequally limited political hierarchies.\nThe \u201cforaging Neolithic\u201d concept has not received any\nwidespread attention in Central Europe, although we do\nknow of regions and phases in which the proportion of\ngame in faunal remains increases. This is, for instance,\nthe case with the onset of the Middle Neolithic in eastern\nCentral Europe (Jeunesse and Arbogast 1997). In the West,\nhowever, subsistence continued to be based on farming,\njust as during the LBK (Du\u00a8rrwa\u00a8chter et al. 2003). When\npondering the meaning of increases in wild fauna remains\nit might be more rewarding to think of climatically in-\nduced crises which made it necessary to shift to hunting\nfor a time as cereal harvests became unpredictable or de-\nclined (Schibler et al. 1997). Interestingly enough, referring\nto an earlier work by Rowly-Conwy (1984), the spread of\nfarming to northwestern Europe has recently again been\nlinked to climatic shifts during the terminal fifth millen-\nnium cal BC (Bonsall, Anderson, and Macklin 2002).\nI find Rowley-Conwy\u2019s article convincing and helpful\nin reassuring non-British Neolithic archaeologists that\nsome of the more curious ideas of postprocessual think-\ning are not shared by all U.K.-based scholars. His con-\ntribution and others may serve as a starting point for a\nrefreshed discussion of culture change in which archae-\nological data will play a more respected role.\nandrew jones\nDepartment of Archaeology, University of\nSouthampton, Highfield, Southampton SO17 1BF, U.K.\n(amj@soton.ac.uk). 19 v 04\nAs a scholar whose theoretical outlook is firmly embed-\nded in post-processualism, I find myself in the somewhat\nS102 F current anthropology Volume 45, Supplement, August\u2013October 2004\npeculiar position of agreeing with the greater part of\nRowley-Conwy\u2019s argument. I owe this in part to the fact\nthat much of my work has been conducted in the\nNorthern Isles of Scotland, where a firmly sedentary Ne-\nolithic prevails.\nThis is not to say that I agree with the tone of the\nargument, which seems to set too much store by the\ndistinctions between economy and ideology, domestic\nand ritual, and environmental archaeologist and inter-\npretative archaeologist. Many of the conclusions depend\nupon the alleged decoupling of ideology from economy.\nSuch a stance appears to perpetuate the perennial dis-\ntinction between domestic and ritual which so hampers\nour understanding of prehistory. The need to maintain\nthis distinction for the purposes of the argument seems\nto foreshorten many of Rowley-Conwy\u2019s conclusions. In\nbrief, I believe that he does not take the argument far\nenough; after 15 years of post-processual debate we have\nreturned to the point at which we began, the Zvelebil\nand Rowley-Conwy three-phase model of the agricul-\ntural transition. While Rowley-Conwy offers a thorough\ndeconstruction of current orthodoxy, he does not incor-\nporate some of the valuable insights that the past 15\nyears of interpretative archaeology have offered.\nOne of the most valuable of these is that the Neolithic\nwas different. Not only did the adoption of agriculture\neffect a major change in cultural perceptions but this\nwent hand in hand with the building of ceremonial mon-\numents. The challenge is to integrate this understanding\nwith the realization that economic change was relatively\nrapid. How were the first domesticates understood? Why\ndoes their adoption seem to be closely related to the use\nof novel material culture and the creation of monu-\nments? These are questions which only a coherent ap-\nproach examining monuments, settlement, material cul-\nture, and animals and plants in equal light can hope to\nanswer, and they have preoccupied interpretative ar-\nchaeologists for at least a decade.\nIn regions such as Orkney, where we observe upstand-\ning stone-built settlement from at least 3600 BC, it is\npossible to provide such an integrated view. Richards\n(e.g., 1990) has demonstrated the cosmological and ritual\nsignificance of the house, while I have shown that ma-\nterial culture and (domestic) foods are equally func-\ntional\/economic and socially significant (Jones 1999,\n2002). I agree that the house should be returned to the\ncentre of our understanding of Neolithic settlement in\nnorth-western Europe, but in the process we must be\ncareful not to invoke \u201cubiquitous domesticity.\u201d Neo-\nlithic houses are anything but grindingly domestic, as a\ncursory reading of the ethnographic literature shows (see\nalso Whittle 2003). The opposition between domestic\nand ritual is an artefact of the Reformation, and it is\nunhelpful to continue to apply it to past cultural\ncontexts.\nRowley-Conwy is correct to question the dominance\nof a shifting-settlement model for the Neolithic and the\nallied supposition that this means wild foods. There is\nno reason to suppose that Neolithic settlement through-\nout Britain and Ireland was the same. As he notes, both\nCooney and Barclay have been at pains to point this out\nfor Ireland and Scotland. Equally, Cooney (2000) makes\nthe valuable point that even within Ireland we should\nnot expect uniformity of settlement, monumentality,\nand landscape use. That there are problems with the\nwholesale adoption of the \u201cWessex\u201d model of transitory\nsettlement need not mean that it does not apply for some\nareas.\nProbably the most striking proposition here is that the\ntransition was relatively rapid and likely to have been\naccompanied by migration. The disruptive nature of this\nchange will repay closer investigation, and we need to\nreconsider how we think about migration. Rowley-\nConwy overlooks the strontium and oxygen isotope anal-\nysis conducted by Douglas Price and Alex Bentley for\nLBK populations (Bentley et al. 2002, Price et al. 2001),\nwhich indicates population movement but also complex\ninteractions between migrants and indigenes. The \u201cwave\nof disruption\u201d invoked by Rowley-Conwy evidently in-\nvolves social interaction, and it is the nature of this in-\nteraction that is of crucial importance. The literature on\nthe role of material culture in colonial interaction is of\nimmense value here (e.g., N. Thomas 1991, Gosden and\nKnowles 2001). We need to move toward a view in which\nthe social relations of interaction across \u201cborder zones\u201d\nare central. We need to adopt Gosden and Knowles\u2019s\nhelpful proposition that in interactions of this kind we\nshould expect to observe change in both the colonizer\nand the colonized. This is the kind of thing we ought to\nbe able to pick up through study not only of the presence\/\nabsence of agriculture, material culture, or monuments\nbut of the social practices in which they are involved.\nNeolithic studies are on the verge of yet another rev-\nolution in thinking. This paper offers an important cri-\ntique of current approaches, but the author is in danger\nof returning to the bad old days of economic determin-\nism. Ideology can never be decoupled from economics,\nand a proper study of the Neolithic requires that equal\nweight be given to both.\nleendert p . louwe kooi jmans\nFaculty of Archaeology, Leiden University, P.O. Box\n9515, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands (l.p.louwe.\nkooijmans@arch.leidnuniv.nl). 1 vi 04\nI fully agree with the main issue of this paper, namely,\nthat an \u201cacademic elite\u201d has emerged in British archae-\nology in the past 15 years or so that has focused more\non explanation from a post-processual or contextual the-\noretical viewpoint than on the constraints established\nby the factual evidence. The resulting dichotomy be-\ntween the more conventional archaeologists and aca-\ndemic archaeology has not, however, troubled non-Brit-\nish archaeologists much, since the work is focused\nmainly on the British situation. A few, such as Whittle\nin his reopening of the old debate on a possible Wan-\nderbauerntum of the Linearbandkeramik (LBK), have ex-\ntended this approach to the continent, but few prehis-\nrowley-conwy Reconsideration of Agricultural Origins F S103\ntorians have joined this senseless debate: if any Neolithic\ncommunity was permanently settled it was the LBK!\nI also agree with the arguments against Mesolithic in-\ntensification, even for Denmark, but this does not mean\nthat the Late Mesolithic communities were not suscep-\ntible to the new opportunities offered by farmers. It is\ntrue that high-resolution data on the Late Mesolithic are\nconcentrated in southern Scandinavia and that the Eu-\nropean Late Mesolithic is treated like a clone of it. The\nnew evidence from Hardinxveld in the Rhine Delta\n(Louwe Kooijmans 2003) demonstrates, however, a com-\nparable way of life: seasonal sedentism and the option\nof a distinct territoriality and a contact network more\nthan 150 km in extent as documented by raw materials.\nIn addition, cultivation and\/or protection of special re-\nsources can be assumed as an aspect of a native knowl-\nedge system, heavy and sophisticated woodworking was\npractised in the building of dugout canoes, and domes-\nticates had been known for millennia in the form of the\ndog. Yes, this way of life contrasted markedly with that\nof the Linearbandkeramik, with which it had been con-\nfronted ca. 5300 cal. BC, but these communities can be\nconceived as the prototype of a fully domestic commu-\nnity in the sense of Hodder, fully focused on a self-created\ndomestic world in the wilderness. At the same time, the\nLate Mesolithic should not be conceived as completely\n\u201cwild\u201d: it was more settled and domestic than one might\nconclude from the traditional flint scatters. And yet the\nresponse to the LBK \u201cinput\u201d was very reserved; the\nhunter-gatherers\u2019 adoption of Neolithic traits took more\nthan 1,000 years\u2014(point-based) pottery (5000 cal BC),\nimported perforated stone wedges and long flint blades\n(ca. 4800 cal BC), domestic animals (ca. 4500 cal BC), all\nfour in low percentages, and a semi-agrarian subsistence\neconomy with cereals and domesticates 1 50% (4100 cal\nBC). A very similar sequence has recently been docu-\nmented by Hartz, Heinrich, and Lu\u00a8bke (2002) for the\nGerman Baltic coastal area.\nAll this demonstrates, first, that a view of the Neo-\nlithization of north-western Europe should include the\ncontinental fringe to the north of the Belgian-German\nBandkeramik and its successors. Britain and Denmark\ncannot be understood in isolation. Second, it shows that\nfundamental new evidence that changes our perspective\nremains to be discovered, possibly in Britain as well.\nThird, it demonstrates the importance of chronological\nresolution and a sound chronology, which is the main\ntool for documenting processes and essential for produc-\ning possible explanations. Last but not least, it opens our\neyes to the very differentiated course of the transition\u2014\nthe rapid spread of the Bandkeramik as opposed to the\nmore gradual extension across France in the fourth mil-\nlennium and the long-term static frontier in the north.\nMost remarkable, however, is the complete lack of ev-\nidence for continental contacts previous to ca. 4000 cal\nBC: no broad blade trapezes, no antler T-axes (except for\ntwo in Scotland), no Breitkeile, no slate bracelets such\nas those typical for the continental and north-western\nFrench Neolithic of this period. Did the British know\nwhat was going on on the continent? What do we know\nabout the phasing of change in the crucial centuries be-\ntween, say 4300 and 3500 cal BC in Britain? How much\ntime was involved in the Neolithization process, and in\nwhat sequence were the various aspects adopted? Was it\nas a complete package or a matter of choice from a \u201crep-\nertoire\u201d? Thomas\u2019s graph certainly does not represent\nreality, but it is (at any rate, for an outsider) not easy to\nobtain a well-documented overview, and this makes one\nsuspicious of all \u201cexplanations,\u201d even contextual ones\nsuch as Rowley-Conwy\u2019s proposal of a \u201crapid and mas-\nsive socio-economic wave of disruption.\u201d Agriculture by\nitself may not have been as disruptive as its demographic\nand hierarchical effects. It may very well be that pioneer\nsettlers came leapfrogging, trickling, or creeping in, rap-\nidly increased in numbers in their frontier situation, in\nthe meantime absorbing and acculturating the surround-\ning hunters, and expanded across the whole of Britain.\nI would love to see this supported by patterns in the\narchaeological data.\npoul otto nielsen\nDanish Prehistoric Collections and Environmental\nArchaeology, National Museum of Denmark,\nFrederiksholms Kanal 12, DK-1220 Copenhagen,\nDenmark (poul.otto.nielsen@natmus.dk). 21 v 04\nFor 150 years or more, Danish archaeologists have been\ndiscussing the transition from foraging to farming (Fi-\nscher and Kristiansen 2002), and this is not the first time\nthat Rowley-Conwy has added a contribution to this dis-\ncussion. In 1984 he and Zvelebil presented a model for\ngradual change through three stages\u2014the \u201cavailability\nphase,\u201d the \u201csubstitution phase,\u201d and the \u201cconsolidation\nphase\u201d\u2014as a plausible conceptual frame of reference.\nThe next year he published a review of theories in which\nhe referred to the environmental change towards a colder\nclimate around 4000 BC, causing a decline in marine\nresources and thereby affecting part of the subsistence\nbase of the Erteb\u00f8lle hunters and gatherers in southern\nScandinavia. This situation, he suggested, might have\nprovoked an awakening interest among hunter-gatherers\nin the availability of agriculture, which at that time was\nbeing practiced in neighbouring northern Germany\n(Rowley-Conwy 1985). Then and now, he has shown\nmore interest in inspecting the circumstances, using the\narchaeological and environmental data, than in follow-\ning the current mainstream of archaeological theory.\nSince 1985, excavations of shell middens at coastal sites\nin Jutland have added to the evidence on the change in\nmarine resources ca. 4000 BC, when there was an abrupt\ndecline in the gathering of oysters possibly due to a low-\nering of the tidal range that resulted in more brackish\nwater in the Danish fiords (S. H. Andersen 2000:375;\nPetersen 1993). This event coincided with the appear-\nance of the first Neolithic pottery and lithic tools in the\nlayers of the shell middens.\nThere is ample evidence of the continued use of coastal\nas well as inland sites for hunting, fishing, and gathering\nduring the first part of the Early Neolithic period, ca.\nS104 F current anthropology Volume 45, Supplement, August\u2013October 2004\n3950\u20133500 BC. Later occupation of such sites is less fre-\nquent. Wild resources were therefore exploited by the\nfirst farmers, who seem to have enjoyed a variable diet.\nWas the primary food supply based on hunting, fishing,\nand foraging even after the introduction of agriculture?\nThe shift from a marine to a terrestrial diet at the tran-\nsition from the Mesolithic to the Neolithic has long\nsince been demonstrated by analyses of the 13C content\nof human bones (Tauber 1983). Therefore, we can at least\nrule out a continued dependence on marine resources.\nThe number of sites suitable for hunting and foraging is\nalso limited compared with the inland settlements with\nindications of agriculture. Why, then, do some prehis-\ntorians emphasize the importance of natural resources\nduring this time? It may be because the archaeological\nfinds from coastal and lacustrine sites are often more\nabundant and better preserved than those from inland\nsettlements, which usually provide us with less sub-\nstantial material because of their exposure to later cul-\ntivation and erosion. Considering the radical change in\nsettlement pattern from coastal to inland occupation\nwhich took place all over southern Scandinavia during\nthe first centuries of the Neolithic, it is evident that the\nfocus was more on cultivation than on hunting, fishing,\nand foraging.\nImportant evidence for simultaneous agricultural activ-\nity and grazing of domesticated animals during the first\ncenturies of the Neolithic over a large part of northern\nEurope is supplied by the growing number of pollen dia-\ngrams indicating burning of vegetation and the advent of\ncereal cultivation during the time interval ca. 4000\u20133800\nBC (e.g., Berglund 1991:69; Odgaard 1994:154\u201355). It is a\nstriking fact that animal husbandry extended as far north\nas Uppland in eastern central Sweden during this initial\nstage of the Neolithic (Malmer 2002:24\u201325 with refer-\nences). The way in which the northern group of the Funnel\nBeaker culture expanded ca. 4000\u20133800 BC can be com-\npared with the rapid colonization of the loess area of Cen-\ntral Europe by the Linear Pottery culture ca. 5500 BC. The\nphysical evidence contradicts the \u201cconsensus\u201d that this\nprocess was slow and gradual. There is reason to believe\nthat the impact of the new exploitation of land and the\npossession of livestock also caused multiple and complex\nchanges within the society (see Nielsen 1987).\nlawrence guy straus\nDepartment of Anthropology, University of New\nMexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131, U.S.A.

The postprocessualist emphasis on ide-\nology has led some archeologists to deny the obvious\nabout the revolutionary nature of the appearance of Ne-\nolithic lifeways.

While it is obvious that Homo sap-\niens sapiens has always made sense of the world and\nother people in socially and ideologically constructed\nways (Binford 1962), it is equally clear that humans sur-\nvive by extracting energy from nature. To minimize the\nimportance of the economy in human adaptation in favor\nof an ideational perspective on the remote past is, in my\nopinion, to put the ard before the ox.\nRowley-Conwy makes a very convincing case that\u2014at\nleast in some of the agriculturally peripheral regions of\nEurope\u2014the transition was a rapid economic \u201crevolu-\ntion.\u201d I agree with him and suggest that the changed ide-\nological \u201csuperstructure\u201d and new social arrangements\nmainly followed the subsistence shift, albeit probablyvery\nquickly. What I find hard to understand is why archeol-\nogists would choose to ignore the material facts to support\ngrand ideational theories. While it may be that \u201cman does\nnot live by bread alone,\u201d without sustenance his ideas and\nrelationships will not last long.\nAn important corollary to Rowley-Conwy\u2019s main ar-\ngument is his defense of \u201cmiddle-range theory\u201d (Binford\n1977). It is indeed telling that, with the latest wave of\nnonscientific archeology, concern for the record and how\nit was formed has waned. It is as if, once they learned\nhow hard it was to obtain information from the record,\nmany archeologists simply gave up and began to spec-\nulate on prehistoric belief systems, worldviews, and so-\ncietal relations, drawing more on empathy, subjective\nimpressions, and preconceived notions than on analyses\nof facts (however skewed these may be by differential\npreservation\/destruction or sampling bias). Rowley-\nConwy\u2019s article is an indictment of an archeology in\nwhich seductive (but fatally flawed) ideas have come to\ntake precedence over the meticulously developed em-\npirical record.\nLike the British Isles and Scandinavia, Vasco-Canta-\nbrian Spain is an Atlantic region on the western fringe\nof Europe, far from and ecologically very unlike the Med-\niterranean source regions of domesticated wheats, barley,\nsheep, goats, cattle, and pigs, and has been the focus of\nrecent discussions over the opposing theories of sub-\nstantial migration versus substantial population conti-\nnuity across the transition (see, e.g., Straus et al. 2001,\n2002). The bulk of current evidence here too suggests\nthe need to decouple the theory of \u201cdemic diffusion\u201d\nfrom the undoubted westward spread of cultigens, do-\nmesticated animals, and (possibly) ceramic technology.\nIrrespective of how \u201cthe Neolithic\u201d arrived on the Med-\niterranean shores of France and Spain, it was not long\nbefore its attributes were appearing in the R\u0131\u00b4o Ebro drain-\nage. It is apparent that local human groups with Meso-\nlithic technologies and diversified, foraging-based sub-\nsistence bases adopted the new products and modus\nvivendi while\u2014at least initially\u2014continuing to live in\nmany of the same places and to use many of the same\nkinds of stone tools as before (Alday 2002, Utrilla et al.\n1998).\nThe situation here prior to the adoption of the Neo-\nlithic was reminiscent of that described by Rowley-\nrowley-conwy Reconsideration of Agricultural Origins F S105\nConwy\u2014relatively dense human settlement along the\nAtlantic shore but little evidence of occupation of the\ninterior (but see Arias 1997; Arias et al. 1999:414\u201320).\nThe first Neolithic evidences along the Atlantic facade\ndate to about 5,800 uncal years BP (Arias et al. 1999).\nHowever, several sites at this time have few or no Ne-\nolithic economic products or ceramics but some double-\nbevel retouched geometric segments (another supposed\nNeolithic \u201cmarker\u201d) and evidence of only hunting or\nshellfish collection, suggesting that at the \u201cmoment\u201d of\ntransition there was a mosaic of adaptations (or at least\nof functional site types) in this region (Gonza\u00b4lez Morales\net al. n.d.). Wild animals continued to be hunted, but the\nchange to animal husbandry appears to have been sudden\nand significant (Altuna et al. n.d.). Likewise, the pottery\nis very well made\u2014not evidence of local people\u2019s \u201cstart-\ning from scratch\u201d in this new technology. Indeed, the\nvery intensive, trash-rich nature of settlements in the\ninterior uplands during the earliest Neolithic is radically\ndifferent from the ephemeral, finds-poor visits to the site\nof Mesolithic times. It is possible that forays into the\nmountains had brought these coastally based people into\ncontact with the \u201cNeolithicized\u201d inhabitants of the up-\nper Ebro basin, and it was not only the novel pots that\ninterested them but also the new foodstuffs and way of\nlife. The question remains whether they were \u201cpushed\u201d\nor \u201cpulled\u201d into accepting the Neolithic lifeway. Further\nscientific research should help us to test at least the first\nproposition. The second should not be assumed to be\ncorrect and self-sufficient until the former has been dis-\nmissed on the basis of empirical evidence.\nClearly a rethinking and reorganization of human ter-\nritories did take place in the early Neolithic of even this\nmarginal region, but whatever changes arose were the\nconsequence of a profound change in subsistence. Un-\nderstanding prehistoric decision making and actions\nshould be the central objective of regionally contextual-\nized archeological research.\njul ian thomas\nSchool of Arts, Histories and Cultures, University of\nManchester, Oxford Rd., Manchester M13 9PL, U.K.\n(julian.thomas@man.ac.uk). 25 v 04\nRowley-Conwy\u2019s revisionist account of the north-west\nEuropean Neolithic is something of a \u201cblast from the\npast,\u201d his picture of a Neolithic juggernaut rolling across\nthe continent leaving a landscape of scattered farmsteads\nin its wake evoking the textbooks of the seventies. The\nnew evidence should indeed prompt a reconsideration of\nthe period\u2014but not a return to old models, for it speaks\nof complexity and variability. Rowley-Conwy wants to\ncharacterize the Neolithic, universally agricultural and\nsedentary and uniform throughout Europe. I doubt\nwhether such a thing ever existed.\nRowley-Conwy justifies his argument in terms of a\n\u201cnew consensus\u201d on Neolithic settlement and subsis-\ntence that he supports with parodic renderings of the\narguments, neglecting to acknowledge that those argu-\nments have been revised and refined over the past 15\nyears. Most serious, he presents a polarized distinction\nbetween economy and ideology as prime movers in cul-\ntural change, omitting any discussion of social relation-\nships. Hodder\u2019s (1990) idea of a Neolithic \u201cconceptual\nframework\u201d is not a view that many would share. In-\nstead, I would suggest that the Atlantic Neolithic in-\nvolved a cultural repertoire which was drawn upon se-\nlectively by communities in pursuit of localized\nstrategies and was not underlain by any uniform system\nof meaning (Thomas 1997, 2003). Economic change had\nno guaranteed causal status. and subsistence practice\ncannot be assumed to have formed an infrastructure on\nwhich all other aspects of society were built. With regard\nto monument building, the point is not that non-agri-\ncultural societies can produce \u201csurplus\u201d but that many\neconomic systems have seasonally variable labour in-\nputs, leaving time for other projects. Similarly, whereas\nRowley-Conwy suggests that discussions of Mesolithic\nintensification assume a trajectory leading toward indig-\nenous agriculture, these debates are often more con-\ncerned with the diversification of hunter-gatherer sub-\nsistence patterns and the introduction of domesticates\ninto broad-spectrum economies.\nRowley-Conwy\u2019s treatment of cereals, settlement, and\ndomestic architecture demonstrates how far he squeezes\nthe evidence to fit a universal model. Dental evidence\nsuggesting that Neolithic Britons ate quantities of wild\nplants has been ignored entirely. He claims that a rejec-\ntion of middle-range theory results in an approach which\ntakes botanical evidence at face value, but he rejects at-\ntempts to evaluate the contexts from which these ma-\nterials are recovered, arguing that timber buildings can\nbe taken at face value as houses. Many of these buildings\nburned down, some more than once (Barclay, Brophy, and\nMcGregor 2002). Given that European Bandkeramik\nlonghouses scarcely ever burned, this is probably part of\nthe broader practice of deliberately firing timber cere-\nmonial structures. The contents of these buildings there-\nfore cannot be taken as a \u201csnapshot\u201d of Neolithic do-\nmestic economy. Cereals and cattle meat were probably\n\u201cspecial\u201d foods for much of the British Neolithic. This\ndoes not mean that they had no calorific significance,\nbut it does mean that we need to consider what people\nwere eating the rest of the time. Furthermore, while\nthere are now numerous timber buildings in Ireland and\na number in Britain, almost all the dated examples fall\ninto the first couple of centuries of the Neolithic\n(4000\u20133800 BC) (Cross 2003), and it seems possible that\nthese buildings are a feature of the transition rather than\nthe full-blown Neolithic itself.\nRowley-Conwy\u2019s suggestion that \u201cthe observed pat-\ntern is . . . consistent with a cereal-based economy\u201d is\nespecially problematic when the Neolithic is compared\nwith succeeding periods of prehistory. The numerous\nhouses and field systems and abundant cereal remains\nof the Middle and Late Bronze Age in Britain contrast\nsharply with the Neolithic pattern, and it is hard to at-\ntribute this difference to any change in taphonomic con-\nditions. In this context, the contrast between Britain and\nS106 F current anthropology Volume 45, Supplement, August\u2013October 2004\nIreland is particularly interesting. One possibility is that\nthe beginning of the Neolithic was quite different in\nthese two islands as a consequence of the very different\nMesolithics which preceded it. In Britain, the start of the\nNeolithic saw the substitution of domesticated ungu-\nlates for deer and aurochs, with the maintenance of as-\npects of settlement and mobility patterns. Postglacial\nIreland lacked large wild ungulates, and it is possible that\nthe start of the Neolithic saw a more sudden investment\nin domesticates, resulting in a more abrupt change in\nsettlement and economy.\nThe contrast between Britain and Ireland demonstrates\nthat there was not a single Neolithic in north-western\nEurope but many ways in which localized communities\nmade use of new economic and symbolic resources. No\ndoubt some people in Britain were working small plots\nof cereals with digging sticks and living nearby, but how\nmany, and what were their relationships with mobile\nherders? Oxygen and lead isotope studies of human bone\nare now telling us that Neolithic people were travelling\ngreat distances and shifting from one community to an-\nother. We should be asking new questions about the Ne-\nolithic rather than retreating into outdated interpre-\ntations.\nReply\npeter rowley-conwy\nDurham, U.K. 22 vi 04\nThis is as diverse and fascinating a set of comments as\none could wish for, and I thank all the contributors. It is\nparticularly intriguing that several commentators have\nsought both to take the arguments farther and to apply\nthem more widely. In the Atlantic coastal regions Arias\nand Straus find common ground in their overlapping re-\nsearch areas in Iberia, despite much local variability. They\naccept that the Mesolithic of both Portugal and Vasco-\nCantabria included quite dense coastal settlement and\nthat this involved territoriality in, at any rate, Portugal,\nbut neither argues for directional intensification and both\nfavour a relatively rapid introduction of cereals and do-\nmesticates. Louwe Kooijmans makes a point that I ab-\nsolutely accept\u2014that I should not have considered the\nBritish Isles and southern Scandinavia in isolation but\nshould have included the area north and west of the Bel-\ngian\/German Bandkeramik. In an ideal world (in which I\nhad much greater knowledge and more space at my dis-\nposal) I would have done so; I am happy that Louwe Kooij-\nmans has to some extent \u201cplugged the gap\u201d with his com-\nment. He too discerns a territorial but non-intensifying\nLate Mesolithic curiously slow to adopt \u201cNeolithic\u201d traits\nfrom the Bandkeramik. He makes explicit a point perhaps\nimplicit in some of the other comments\u2014that the Mes-\nolithic of the Low Countries cannot be considered a\n\u201cwild\u201d opposite to the \u201cdomestic\u201d Neolithic (using those\nterms sensu Hodder). I wish I could answer his question\nabout what was going on in the British Mesolithic at the\nsame time. More unexpected is that Budja and Gronen-\nborn have found some parallels with their inland research\nareas. Gronenborn too finds no data to support intensi-\nfication in his Late Mesolithic and no signs of \u201ccomplex-\nity\u201d except in the unique region of the Iron Gates. Budja\nconsiders the earlier agricultural \u201chalt\u201d in the Carpathian\nBasin, arguing likewise that there was little acculturation\nof hunter-gatherers but a rapid increase in the use of ag-\nricultural products from the start.\nIn their various ways these commentators thus all es-\npouse models of rapid agricultural uptake. Budja and\nGronenborn ask why agriculture appeared when it did,\nand both cite the important papers by Bonsall and col-\nleagues (both 2002) as raising the possibility that envi-\nronmental change may have played a part. Such theories\nhave been very unfashionable for the past couple of dec-\nades, and it was not my purpose to raise this area of\ndiscussion. But since these two commentators have\nraised it, let me add my voice to theirs and suggest that,\ngiven the rapidity of the agricultural transition in various\nparts of Europe, it may indeed be time to revisit envi-\nronmental explanations.\nHow should we conceive of \u201cslow\u201d or \u201crapid\u201d? Arias\nmakes the good point that many New Archaeologists have\nadopted parts of the post-processual view in that both per-\nspectives envisage a slow change to agriculture despite\ntheir difference with regard to causal agents. Budja raises\nthe issue of change in the Natufian in the Near East, where\narrival from the outside plays no part in the origins of\nagriculture. In this context too, origins are most com-\nmonly perceived as slow. When archaeologists think\n\u201cslow\u201d we tend to assume millennia, because in our world\nthat is long-term. But when we consider our own life\nspans, then a period of, say, eight human generations\nseems very long. Such a period would, however, vanish\nin the standard deviation of a typical Neolithic radiocar-\nbon date\u2014and consider the amount of change that has\noccurred since AD 1800. In our understanding of the Ne-\nolithic world a two-century change may seem extremely\nabrupt, but when we consider it in human generational\nterms much of its sting is drawn. Should we not rethink\n\u201cslow\u201d and \u201crapid\u201d?\nJones and Nielsen approach the issues from inside the\narea considered, from Britain and Denmark, respectively.\nNielsen\u2019s interesting point that later agriculture may have\ndestroyed much Early Neolithic evidence in the interior\nwhile leaving coastal fishing evidence intact to seem more\nimportant to us by default is one that I had not fully\ngrasped but that is clearly well worth exploring in all the\ncoastal regions of Europe. He highlights the rapidity of the\nspread of agriculture to the north beyond the latitude of\nStockholm, suggesting parallels with the rapid Bandker-\namik spread across the Central European loess belt. Our\nunderstanding of this spread in central Sweden has been\nhugely increased by the recent \u201ccoast-to-coast\u201d project of\nthe Universities of Gothenburg and Uppsala\u2014the Skogs-\nmossen settlement depicted in figure 6, B, was excavated\nunder the auspices of this project. Nielsen\u2019s rapid Swedish\nspread contrasts with the slow spread into France and the\nrowley-conwy Reconsideration of Agricultural Origins F S107\nstatic boundary north of the Bandkeramik mentioned by\nLouwe Kooijmans. All kinds of events were evidently tak-\ning place, and \u201cstop,\u201d \u201cslow,\u201d and \u201cfast\u201d were all clearly\noptions. Despite announcing himself as a post-proces-\nsualist, Jones agrees with the claim of house-based sed-\nentary settlement, possibly because he works in the Ork-\nney Islands. Any Neolithic inhabitant of these islands\ntrying to live in an ephemeral structure would probably\nhave found that the wind rendered it much more ephem-\neral than he desired! I agree with Jones that the \u201cWessex\u201d\nmodel of transitory settlement does not apply here; I also\ndoubt whether it applies to Wessex.\nWhere I disagree with Jones is when he asks, \u201cHow were\nthe first domesticates understood?\u201d I think this is a non-\nquestion because it is one that the archaeological record\nis fundamentally unable to answer. Furthermore, to ex-\npect a single answer to this question is an oversimplifi-\ncation: even had there been a single unitary \u201cunderstand-\ning\u201d within one small community on the day the first\ncereals arrived (which I doubt), it would have changed\nalmost immediately when the first bread or beer was con-\nsumed, again when the first plot was planted, again when\nit was harvested\u2014and how different all of these would\nhave been from an \u201cunderstanding\u201d in a local community\nin which cereals had been cultivated for three human gen-\nerations. Yet our dating methods would not allow us to\nseparate these local communities, even if we could ever\ndiscern the \u201cunderstandings\u201d in the first place.\nSuch problems emerge yet more starkly when one com-\npares the comments of Straus and Thomas. Straus argues\nfor middle-range theory and the use of archaeological data\nand against unfounded speculations about prehistoric be-\nlief systems, etc., expressing himself refreshingly suc-\ncinctly. Thomas, in contrast, wants us to \u201cevaluate the\ncontexts\u201d from which cereal remains come. I disagree\nwith his suggestion that the fact that some timber build-\nings burnt down in some way invalidates their domestic\nnature. He cannot demonstrate whether the burning was\na symbolic act deeply imbued with cultural meaning or\nmerely a catastrophic accident. How, then, can we ever\n\u201cevaluate the context\u201d? He considers the paper a \u201cblast\nfrom the past\u201d and uses the indictment that is most damn-\ning in the relativist world of post-processualism: that it is\n\u201coutdated.\u201d But in a world where competing interpreta-\ntions are evaluated against imperfect data this indictment\nhas no force; the only criterion is how well an interpre-\ntation accords with and explains those data. In that spirit\nI hope that the paper will indeed be judged a \u201cblast from\nthe past\u201d\u2014the prehistoric past.\nReferences Cited\na a r i s - s \u00f8 r e n s e n , k . 1988.
