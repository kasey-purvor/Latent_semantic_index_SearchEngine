The work is described in two main parts. First, a novel modeling approach employing the finite\nelement method has been developed for simulating the various failure mechanisms of a bonded structure and for\npredicting fatigue crack growth life. Crack growth in the substrate and the substrate\/strap interface disbond failure\naremodeled in the framework of linear elastic fracturemechanics. A computer code interfacingwith the commercial\npackage MSC NASTRAN has been developed and validated by experimental tests. Second, the effectiveness of\ndifferent strap configurations on crack growth retardation has beenmodeled; these include different strapmaterials,\nstrap dimensions, and their locations on the substrate. The research has included two substrate materials and four\nstrap materials, and at this stage the specimens were cured at room temperature. Strap stiffness and adhesive\ntoughness are found to be the most influential parameters in designing crack retarders. A design tool has been\ndeveloped based on the numerical simulation to achieve optimal crack retarder design in terms of prescribed fatigue\nlife target and minimum structural weight added by the bonded reinforcement.\nI. Introduction\nI NTEGRAL structures for aircraft fuselage and wing assembliesallow the achievement of significant weight savings as well as\ncost reductions. Manufacturing processes, such as welding, casting,\nforging, large-scale extrusion, and high-speed machining, will\npermit modular prefabrication of large sections of an aircraft before\nfinal assembly [1,2]. This is especially true for skin-stringer panels,\nwhich constitute the main component of aircraft wing and fuselage\nshells. Integral \u201cunitized\u201d panels benefit from the absence of crack\ninitiation sources compared with the traditional built-up structures,\nfor example, riveted panels. However, integral panels lack the\ncapability of retarding or arresting crack propagation due to the lack\nof redundant members. For this reason, regulators penalize unitized\nstructures by imposing an additional design safety factor.\nOne promising solution is to use bonded straps as crack growth\nretarders for integral structures [3\u20138]. The concept is illustrated in\nFig. 1. These selective reinforcement straps could be made of fiber\npolymer composites, fiber\u2013metal laminates (FML), or metallic\nalloys. Unlike the repair patches [9\u201315], which are usedwhen fatigue\ncracks are detected, these crack retarders will be part of the original\naircraft structure and subjected to operational loads and environ-\nments throughout the entire service life. The damage tolerance\ncapability is added to the integral panels ab initio. In this way, safer,\nlighter, and cheaper structures can be built and the role of metallic\nstructures in future aircraft reevaluated.\nSome studies have been carried out to evaluate the bonded\nselective reinforcement. In 1990, Schijve [3] reported his work on\nbonded crack stoppers bands using either a fiber\u2013metal laminate\nnamed ARALL, an aluminum alloy, or a titanium alloy. These straps\nwere either riveted or bonded to the aluminum substrate. Fatigue\ncrack growth tests showed that the best strap materials were the\nARALL and titanium alloy. Recently, only bonded straps were\nstudied, because riveting would introduce stress concentration spots.\nHeinimann et al. [4] tested different strap configurations and\nmaterials (GLARE-1, aluminum 7075-T762, and carbon-epoxy-\nbased fiber\u2013metal laminates) on aluminum substrates and obtained\nexcellent results. Wide panels with seven bonded GLARE-1 straps\nwere tested. The straps were stretched to reverse the bonding residual\nstress in the aluminum substrate from tension to compression. The\nresults were good; the thinnest test panels had the largest\nreinforcement volume fraction (28%) and achieved an average\nfatigue life improvement ofmore than 300%.Other tests were carried\nout on aluminum panels reinforced by GLARE and unidirectional\n(UD) carbon-epoxy fiber\u2013metal laminates. The tensile residual\nstresses induced by the cure cycle were reduced by pinning the grip\nends of the substrate and straps during the cure process. In this way,\nthe fatigue crack growth (FCG) life can be significantly increased.\nZhang and Li [5] studied by numerical simulation integral stringer\npanels reinforced by either UD carbon-epoxy laminates or Ti-6Al-\n4V straps. The finite elementmethod (FEM)was used tomodel crack\ngrowth and disbond failure. Based on the numerical modeling, the\nFCG life was significantly improved by both types of bonded straps.\nTests and finite element (FE) modeling were conducted by Colavita\net al. [6] and Bowler [7] using carbon-epoxy straps on an aluminum\nplate. They found the adverse effect of thermal residual stresses\narising from curing the adhesive at an elevated temperature, which\nactually reduced the life of the strapped integral structure compared\nwith the unreinforced one.\nThe objective of the work reported in this paper is to develop a\nmodeling approach based on the finite element method and using a\nfracture mechanics based failure criterion. A study of the strap\nmaterials and geometries has been carried out for structural\napplications and a design tool has been developed.\nII. State of the Art in Modeling Techniques\nfor Bonded Structures\nAlthough bonded patch repairs and bonded selective reinforce-\nment are two different concepts, the phenomena in retarding fatigue\ncrack growth rate are similar. If a crack grows in the substrate, the\nbonded strap retards the crack propagation by exerting a bridging\nforce at the crack surfaces. However, damagemay also develop in the\nstrap; for example, due to the stiffness mismatch and high stress\nconcentration, the strap\/skin interface is affected by a progressive\ndelamination or disbond, which advances together with the substrate\nPresented as Paper 2116 at the 48th AIAA\/ASME\/ASCE\/AHS\/ASC\nStructures, Structural Dynamics, and Materials Conference, Honolulu,\nHawaii, 23\u201326April 2007; received 16November 2007; revision received 20\nMarch 2008; accepted for publication 6 April 2008.

Both subjects have been\nstudied and the modeling techniques are reviewed later.\nThe work of many researchers [9\u201315] has resulted in the\ndevelopment of a repair scheme employing a bonded composite\npatch. The bonding process is very effective because it provides a\nload transfer into the patch without introducing any stress\nconcentration into the structure. Themain drawback is that the curing\nprocess of the adhesive requires an elevated temperature and pressure\nthat generate thermal residual stresses in the substrate. A list of\napplications of patch repair techniques can be found in Baker [10].\nImportant aspects are the choice of the patch material, surface\ntreatment, and adhesive selection.\nOn the analysis front, the aim has been to determine the stress\nintensity factor (SIF) values and stresses or strains in the patch and\nadhesive system. Analytical and numerical methods have been\ndeveloped to study patch repairs [9\u201315], but none of these is able to\nstudy the delamination\/disbond growth in the adhesive interface.\nOne method has been developed by Naboulsi and Mall [12] that\nemploys 2-D Mindlin plate elements to model the substrate,\nadhesive, and patch. The contribution of the rotation movement to\nthe strain energy release rate (SERR) was considered using the\nmodified virtual crack closure technique [16] (MVCCT or VCCT).\nThis model, often referred to as the \u201cthree-layer technique,\u201d is the\nmost employed, but disbond is not entirely taken into account. In\nfact, disbond shape and size are prescribed as a function of the\nsubstrate crack length by observing the test results. Moreover, the\nprogressive growth of the disbondwith the substrate crack length and\nits effect on the final FCG life of the structure were not studied. Only\nthe SERR was computed along the disbond front (which was\nassumed to be elliptical). Sun et al. [13] as well as Colombi et al. [8]\nstudied disbond in the same way, that is, by prescribing an elliptical\ndisbond shape and computing the SERRon its front. In Sec. III, a new\nmodeling technique will be introduced, and, by this technique, a\nprogressive disbond can be computed.\nZhang and Li [5] modeled integral stiffened panels with bonded\nunidirectional carbon-epoxy and Ti-6AL-4V straps. In this case, 2-D\nplate elements were employed for the straps and aluminum substrate,\nand three spring elements were employed for the adhesive. The\nfailure of the adhesive and the disbond growth were studied. The\nadhesive failure was modeled by a strength-based criterion, and the\nfailure of the spring elementswas imposedwhen either the vonMises\nstress or interlaminar shear stress exceeded the allowable. This\nmethod is able to calculate the disbond, but the stress values in the FE\nmodels are mesh dependent. The SIF solution was integrated by the\nAFGROW code [17] to obtain fatigue crack growth life.\nIII. Modeling Approach\nA. Two-Layer-Plus-Spring Model\nThe main challenge in predicting the potential of bonded\ncomposite straps as crack retarders by FE models is the\nunderstanding and modeling of the different failure mechanisms\nthat affect the strap\/substrate assembly. These are the lead crack in\nthe substrate, the disbond growth in the adhesive interface, and their\ninteractions. A computer program, interfaced to the MSC\/\nNASTRAN commercial finite element package, has been developed\nto model the previously mentioned failure modes, calculate the SIF\nfor progressive crack lengths, and predict the fatigue crack growth\nlife of strapped plates. This program is based on a particular\nmodeling technique developed by the authors, which is referred as\nthe \u201ctwo-layer-plus-spring\u201dmodel. This paper reports the first-stage\nwork, in which only the room temperature cured adhesives were\nmodeled to exclude the thermal residual stress effect.\nThe FE models employ 2-D plate elements for the substrate, 2-D\nlaminate\/plate elements for the strap, and interface elements for the\nadhesive. Each of the interface elements contains two rigid elements\nto model the thickness of the adhesive and three coincident spring\nelements for each pair of nodes at the strap\/substrate interface to\nmodel the peel and shear properties of the adhesive (Fig. 2). The\nadhesive model was developed by Tahmasebi [18] for analysis of\nbonded joints, and it was used in thiswork to simulate the behavior of\nthe adhesive in the bonding interface due to the convenience of being\nable to delete the spring elements as the disbond failure progresses.\nThe stiffness of the spring elements (Kaz, Kax, and Kay) along the\nthree directions can be computed by using the following equations:\nKaz \u0001 AaEata ; Kax \u0001 Kay \u0001\nAaGa\nta\n(1)\nwhere Aa is the equivalent area of the adhesive element (one-quarter\nof the area of each plate element it is connected to [18]), Ea is the\nadhesive elastic modulus,Ga is the adhesive shear modulus, and ta is\nthe adhesive thickness.\nLinear elastic fracture mechanics are used to calculate the\nprincipal parameters that govern the fracture failure. Through the FE\nanalysis and the MVCCT technique [16], the strain energy release\nrate, SERRorG, on the disbond front of the adhesive is computed for\na given lead crack length (a) and for every fracture mode (I, II). The\nstrain energy release rate is computed for each group of springs at the\ndisbond periphery. Using a mixed mode failure criterion [Eq. (2)],\nthe failed adhesive elements are found and deleted to simulate\nadhesive disbond progression:\nGI\nGIC\n\u0002 GII\nGIIC\n\u0003 1 (2)\nwhereGIC,GIIC are the critical strain energy release rates for modes I\nand II. Whenever the disbond shape has changed, a subsequent FE\nanalysis is performed to find the forces and displacements in the\nspring elements. When the disbond front is steady, that is, no more\nspring fails, a node at the lead crack tip is released, and by applying\nthe MVCCT [16] for the lead crack in the substrate, the SERR (GI)\nfor that crack length is calculated. The SIF (KI) can be obtained from\nGI by [19]\nKI \u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nGIE\np \u0004plane stress\u0005\nKI \u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nGIE\n1 \u0006 \u00012\nr\n\u0004plane strain\u0005\n(3)\nwhere E is the elastic modulus and \u0001 is the Poisson\u2019s ratio of the\nsubstrate material.\nNormalizing the SIF obtained from Eq. (3) by the stress intensity\nfactor of an infinitely large plate under uniform remote stress (\u00021),\nthe dimensionless SIF (\u0003) is obtained\n\u0003\u0001 KI\n\u00021\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0004a\np (4)\nwhere a is the crack length for a single-edge notch sample or half-\ncrack length for center-crack geometry [19]. When the lead crack is\nincreased by\u0001a and the new disbond front is computed, a newKI for\nFig. 1 Integral stiffened panel with selective reinforcements.\nFig. 2 Diagram of the employed finite elements for modeling the\nsubstrate plate, strap, and adhesive in the FE models. Spring nodes are\ncoincident in the model but for the sake of clarity are presented as\nseparated.\n2324 BOSCOLO, ALLEGRI, AND ZHANG\nthe new crack length is obtained. Eventually, a SIF solution as a\nfunction of crack length is obtained. Integrating the SIF solution\nusing either the Paris equation [20] [Eq. (5)] or the NASA developed\ncrack growth calculation routine called the NASGRO equation [17],\nthe FCG life is obtained:\nda\ndN\n\u0001 C\u0004\u0001K\u0005n (5)\nwhereN is the number of load cycles,\u0001K is the SIF range under the\ncyclic load, and C and n are material constants. (Even though the\nNASGRO equation is more accurate than the Paris law, data for\nevery material are not available in the AFGROWdatabase [17].) For\nnewmaterials, the Paris equation is often used with available da\ndN\ndata.\nA flowchart of the computation program is illustrated in Fig. 3.\nTo separate the two effects of strap stiffness (due to the material\nselection and strap dimension) and thermal residual stresses (induced\nby an elevated cure temperature), the test and modeling work\nreported in this paper are all based on the room temperature cure\ncases, that is, the thermal residual stress effect is not included. When\ncuring samples at an elevated temperature, the residual stresses\narising from the mismatch of the thermal expansion coefficients of\nthe substrate and strap materials will affect the stress intensity factor\nvalues and hence the crack growth rates. This part of the work is\nongoing, and part of the results are reported in [21].\nB. Considerations of Disbond Growth Under Fatigue Load\nAn original feature of the aforementionedmentionedmodel is that\nthe adhesive disbond growth is interactively simulated. Most of the\nliterature on patch repairs is based on prescribing a disbond size and\nshape as a function of the substrate crack length by observing the test\nresults [8,12,13].\nDelamination growth under fatigue loads in the literature may be\ncomputed by Paris-type laws [22\u201324]:\ndl\ndN\n\u0001 f\u0004\u0001G\u0005 (6)\nwhere dl is the incremental length of disbond and \u0001G the SERR\nrange under fatigue load. These methods calculate \u0001G and then\nintegrate the chosen law of Eq. (6) to predict the fatigue delamination\ngrowth life [25]. A major limitation of these laws is that, unlike the\ncrack growth equations for metallic structures, the database of\nmaterial constants of different substrate\/strap bonds with a specific\nadhesive has not yet been developed, hence the use of this equation is\nvery limited.\nCohesive elements have also been used in the literature to model\ndisbond in composite materials [26]. These cohesive elements have\nalso been employed to study the effect of the adhesive properties and\nits interaction with the plasticity of the substrate for a steel plate\nreinforced by a carbon-epoxy plate byBocciarelli et al. [27]. Another\nway of modeling delamination has been developed by Xie and\nBiggers [28,29]. A new finite element composed of two 8-node plate\nelements and three spring elements has been implemented in the\nABAQUS code. This element calculates the SERR through the\nMVCCT inside the specially developed element itself, and the\nsprings within this element will be deleted when broken using a\nmixed failure criterion. In thisway, amoving delamination frontwith\nan arbitrary shape can be analyzed using a stationary mesh.\nIn the modeling technique presented in this paper, the disbond\nanalysis is based on the same idea of Xie and Biggers [28,29].\nThrough the MVCCT, the SERR is computed on the crack front\nkeeping memory of the disbond direction. Using a mixed mode\nfailure criterion [Eq. (2)], the adhesive elements that failed are known\nandwill be deleted to simulate adhesive disbond. This could be called\nan \u201calmost-static\u201d delamination growth, because it does not entirely\ntake into account the disbond growth due to the fatigue load.\nHowever, it must be said that the disbond growth in patch repair and\ncrack retarder problems is mostly due to the high stress arising from\nthe stress \u201csingularity\u201d in the cracked substrate rather than from the\nfatigue load history.\nIt should be noted that, due to the disbond, the \u0003 solution, which is\njust a function of the geometry in the classical linear elastic fracture\nmechanics (LEFM) framework, will be an indirect function of the\napplied load. In fact, the disbond shape, which depends on the\napplied load, affects the geometry of the bonded plate and this will\nchange the \u0003 solution. However, it is still convenient to use \u0003 as a\nnondimensional SIF to describe the crack growth driving force,\nwhich is expressed as independent of the applied load. In our future\nwork,we intend to derive a group of\u0003 vsa relations corresponding to\ndifferent applied stress levels so that the users can select the correct\ncurve or interpolate for intermediate load levels. It is more\nconvenient to use the \u0003 vs a relation (rather than theK vs a relation)\nfor calculating crack growth rates under variable amplitude loads and\nfor using computer packages such as the AFGROW [17].\nFig. 3 Flow diagram for predicting the FCG life of a substrate with bonded crack retarders.\nBOSCOLO, ALLEGRI, AND ZHANG 2325\nIV. Results and Discussions\nThe test samples include a middle-crack tension, M(T), made of\n2024-T351 alloy, and a single-edge notch tension, SENT, made of\n7085-T765, as shown in Fig. 4. The mechanical properties and\nthickness of the aluminum plates can be found in Table 1. The\nproperties of the four strap materials and an adhesive are shown in\nTable 2.\nA. Validation by Experimental Tests\nTheM(T) plate reinforced by a pair of UD carbon-epoxy-laminate\nstraps, Fig. 4a, was modeled, and the results were compared with the\nexperimental ones [6,7]. The critical strain energy release rates of\nthe adhesive are GIC \u0001 100 J=m2 and GIIC \u0001 350 J=m2. The\nmaximum applied load was \u0002 \u0001 75 MPa, and the stress ratio was\nR\u0001 \u0002min=\u0002max \u0001 0:1.\nIn Fig. 5a, the calculated \u0003 solution is plotted and compared with\nan unreinforced plate and a reinforced one with ideal bond (no\ndisbond failure). It can be seen that the effect of disbond is\nremarkable and cannot be neglected. The predicted and measured\nFCG lives are shown in Fig. 5b. The largest discrepancy between the\npredicted life and the test is about 10%. The disbond shapemeasured\nduring the test is comparedwith the final disbond shape computed by\nthe model and presented in Fig. 6. The disbond shapes are in good\nagreement. It can be said that the code is able to calculate the\n\u0003 solution, the disbond damage between the strap and substrate, and\nthe FCG life for a reinforced plate when the adhesive is cured at room\ntemperature.\nB. Parametric Study: Strap Materials\n1. Analysis\nDifferent strapmaterials were studied by keeping theweight of the\nstrap constant (4.5 g), that is, by changing the thickness of the strap as\na function of the specific volume. The selection of strapmaterials was\nperformed on the M(T) specimen made of aluminum 2024-T3 (the\nproperties and thickness are shown in Table 1). The geometry and\ndimension of the plate and strap can be seen in Fig. 4a. The\nmechanical properties of the strap materials can be found in Table 2.\nThe load applied to the plate was \u0002 \u0001 75 MPa, and the stress ratio\nwas R\u0001 0:1. The adhesive was cured at room temperature, and the\nanalysis was carried out in the elastic field.\nFirst, different laminate stacking sequences were examined for the\ncarbon-epoxy and glass-epoxy straps, then the best carbon-epoxy\nand glass-epoxy straps were compared with the straps made of\ntitanium alloy and fiber\u2013metal laminate (GLARE).\nThe results for the different layups of the carbon-epoxy straps are\nshown in Fig. 7. Figure 7a shows that the UD straps provide the\nlowest crack growth driving force in terms of \u0003, and as one can see\nfrom Fig. 7b, the longest life as well. It must be said, though, that by\nusing the UD straps, disbond failure happens earlier than with other\nstraps and in a sudden manner, that is, the strap disbonds completely\nbefore the plate fails. (Disbond is a function of the load, and the\nconsiderations hereby made are valid for the load examined).\nIf we consider the complete disbond of the strap as a failure\ncriterion, then the UD strap cannot be employed. However, if we\nconsider that the substrate is able to carry the load after the disbond\nuntilfinal failure, thenUDstrapswould be the best stacking sequence\n(the reasons for complete disbond will be examined later). Similar\nranking of stacking sequences was obtained for the glass-epoxy\nstraps. Examining Fig. 7, we can say that carbon-epoxy or glass-\nepoxy angle-ply laminates are not suitable for effectively retarding\nthe crack growth. The best material, if we consider complete disbond\nunacceptable, is the carbon-epoxy cross-ply (CP) laminate.\nHowever, if we consider that the strap can be subjected to complete\ndisbond, then the carbon-epoxy unidirectional laminate is the best\none.\nHaving studied the carbon-epoxy straps, we examined other strap\nmaterials andmade comparisons among the four candidatematerials.\nFigure 8 shows the comparisons in terms of the crack growth driving\nforce \u0003 and the predicted FCG lives. The best one seems to be the\ncarbon-epoxy cross ply. In fact, the carbon-epoxy UD had already\nbeen eliminated because of the largest disbond caused by high\nstiffness mismatch. We can find in Fig. 8b that the other good straps\nFig. 4 Geometry and dimension of two test specimens.\nTable 1 Mechanical properties and the Paris law coefficients of\naluminum alloy 2024-T3 employed for the M(T) and aluminum alloy\n7085-T7651 for the SENT samples\nMaterial Aluminum 2024-T3 [7] Aluminum 7085-T7651a\nt, mm 1.6 10\nE, MPa 73,000 71,000\n\u0001 0.33 0.33\n\u0005, g=cm3 2.77 2.77\nC 1:1 \u0007 1010 6:186 \u0007 1010\nn 2.601 2.791\naTest data from the material used in the study.\nTable 2 Mechanical property of the strap materials and adhesive employed in the constant weight analysis\nMaterial Adhesivea Carbon epoxy [7] S glass epoxyb GLAREc Titaniumd\nType Redux 810 M21\/T800 Generic 1 Generic\nLamination \u00061=\u00062=\u00062=\u00061 \u00061=\u00062=\u00061 2\/1\nt, mm 0.2 4 \u0007 0:125 0:125=0:2=0:125 0.36 0.2\nE1, MPa 1900 171,000 43,000 66,000 110,000\nE2, MPa 1900 17,200 8900 54,000 110,000\nG12, MPa 621 5100 4500 16,000 41,353\n\u000112 0.52 0.42 0.27 0.31 0.33\n\u0005, g=cm3 1.1 1.8 2 2.52 4.51\naData available online at www.hexcel.com [retrieved Dec. 2006].\nbData available online at http:\/\/composite.about.com\/library\/data\/blg-sgepoxy.htm [retrieved Dec. 2006].\nc[32].\ndGeneric properties.\n2326 BOSCOLO, ALLEGRI, AND ZHANG\nare made of GLARE and the titanium alloy. Discussions on other\nselection criteria for strap materials are reported in Sec. IV.B.4.\n2. Discussion\nFrom the preceeding results, it can be inferred that the important\ndesign parameter is the stiffness of the strap in the direction\nperpendicular to the substrate crack propagation. The stiffness of a\nstrap is associated with the product of the Young\u2019s modulus (E) and\nthe cross-sectional area. In fact, a stiffer strap is able to reduce the\ncrack-tip SIF (or \u0003) when the crack enters the strap region and\npropagates under the strap, the so-called strap stiffening effect. This\nphenomenon is similar to the crack growth in a skin-stringer panel, in\n 0\n 0.2\n 0.4\n 0.6\n 0.8\n 1\n 1.2\n 1.4\n 1.6\n 1.8\n 20  40  60  80  100  120\n\u03b2\na, mm\nStrap\nNo disbond\nDisbond (GIIc=350 J\/m)\nNo strap\n 20\n 40\n 60\n 80\n 100\n 120\n 0\u00d7100  1\u00d7105  2\u00d7105  3\u00d7105  4\u00d7105  5\u00d7105  6\u00d7105  7\u00d7105\na\n,\n \nm\nm\nN, cycle\nStrap\nPredicted \nTest\na) Calculated   solutions b) FCG lives of M(T) sample with straps\u03b2\nFig. 5 M(T) sample with and without straps; test [6] and predicted results.\nFig. 6 Comparison of disbond front between the experimental measurement and the calculated result.

For example, the relative stiffness S is\ndefined as the ratio of the in-plane extensional stiffness of the\nstiffener and the skin sheet and is given by [30]\nS\u0001 AE2=btE1 (7)\nwhereA is the cross-sectional area of the stiffener, t is the thickness of\nthe skin sheet, b is the stiffener pitch, and E1 and E2 are the Young\u2019s\nmodulus of the sheet and stiffener, respectively. In a similar way, a\nparameter to quantify the stiffening effect of the strap was defined by\nSchjive [3] for bonded reinforced plates:\n\u0007\u0001\nP\nn\ni\u00011 E\ni\nrA\ni\nr\nEsAs \u0002\nP\nn\ni\u00011 E\ni\nrA\ni\nr\n(8)\nwhere Er, Es, Ar, and As correspond to the longitudinal Young\u2019s\nmodulus and the cross-section area of the reinforcement strap and the\nsubstrate, respectively, and n is the total number of straps. The\nstiffening effect can be seen in Figs. 7a and 8a; when the crack tip is\nbefore and under the strap, the \u0003 solution is lower than the\nunreinforced plate. Another positive effect is the so-called bridging\neffect. When the crack tip has passed the strap region, the strap will\nproduce a bridging (or traction) force to reduce the crack opening\ndisplacement and thus a reduction on the \u0003 value (refer to Figs. 7a\nand 8a). This effect can also be characterized by the stiffness ratio\n[Eq. (8)].\nStiffness also contributes to other mechanisms involved in bonded\nstructures as summarized in Table 3, for example, disbond failure at\nthe interface due to shear load transfer. A stiffer strap will cause a\nbigger stiffness mismatch with the substrate material and hence a\nlarger disbond due to the fact that more stress will be transferred from\nthe substrate to the strap. A tradeoff between strap stiffness and\nadhesive toughness is necessary during the selection of the strap\nmaterials. Other mechanisms are the secondary bending effect due to\na one-sided strap and thermal residual stresses generated by the\nelevated temperature curing process of the adhesive, which promote\ncrack opening and bending. The last is not considered in this paper,\nbecause the adhesive was cured at room temperature. However, it is\nincluded in the mechanisms in Table 3 for completeness.\n3. Critical Disbond\nThe complete disbond shown by the UD carbon-epoxy materials\nwas further studied to find reasons and causes. The same plate\nconfiguration of the previous problem was employed (see Fig. 4a).\nTwoUD carbon-epoxy straps of different thicknesses (t\u0001 0:25 and\n0.5 mm) and one cross-ply carbon-epoxy strap (t\u0001 0:5 mm) were\nexamined under different applied load values. The results can be seen\nin Fig. 9. For each given applied stress (\u0002), the critical crack length\n(acrit) can be found at which the complete strap disbond failure will\noccur. Intuitively, the complete disbond will depend on the\nmismatching between the stiffness of the aluminum substrate and the\nstrap. In fact, the stiffer the strap, the more load will be transferred\nfrom the substrate to the reinforcement through the adhesive, and the\nadhesive will fail earlier. This observation can be demonstrated by\ncalculating the membrane stiffness of the laminates A (see\nAppendix). It must be noted that the stiffest material is theUD carbon\n 0.4\n 0.6\n 0.8\n 1\n 1.2\n 1.4\n 1.6\n 1.8\n 20  40  60  80  100  120\n\u03b2\na, mm\nStrap\nNo strap\nGlass  UD strap\nTitanium strap\nGLARE strap\nCarbon CP strap\n 20\n 40\n 60\n 80\n 100\n 120\n 0\u00d7100  1\u00d7105  2\u00d7105  3\u00d7105  4\u00d7105  5\u00d7105  6\u00d7105\na\n,\n \nm\nm\nN, cycle\nStrap\nNo strap\nGlass UD strap\nTitanium strap\nGLARE strap\nCarbon CP strap\nb) Predicted FCG livesa) Calculated   solutions\u03b2\nFig. 8 Comparison of different strap materials.

It can be said that critical disbond does not only depend on the\nmismatching between the stiffness of the substrate and the strap, but\nalso on the difference between the values A11 and A22 of the\nmembrane stiffness of the laminate. This means that in terms of\ncomplete disbond, cross-ply or fabric laminates should behave better\nthan the unidirectional ones, but more plies are necessary to obtain a\nmaterial that is as stiff as the UD laminate. To summarize, the UD\ncomposites should be employed to obtain a life target, but if they\nsuffer from complete disbond under a given load and geometry, then\ncross-ply or fabric laminates could be employed to achieve that life\ntarget without critical disbond failure.\n4. Other Selection Criteria for Strap Materials\nThe ranking of the strap materials has been based on the crack\ngrowth life, which is mainly influenced by the stiffness ratio of the\nstrap over the substrate [Eq. (8)]. It should be acknowledged that\nfatigue crack growth life is not the only sizing criterion for aircraft\nstructures, and, as a result, some of the best solutions for improved\ncrack growth may not be feasible for real design applications. For\nexample, galvanic corrosion is a concern for long-term durability\nwhen bonding carbon-epoxy composites to aluminum structures.\nAnother important design criterion is the notch strain to failure limit.\nBecause there are holes in the aluminum structure as well as in the\nreinforcement straps, the realistic maximum strain of a metallic wing\nbox at ultimate load is about 2\u20132.5%. The maximum notch strain to\nfailure of carbon-fiber composites is around 0.8\u20131.0%. Hence, if we\nuse a strap that has a blunt notch strain to failure much below that of\nthe metallic structure, we could either risk the failing of the strap\nbefore reaching the structure ultimate load or have to limit the\nmaximum design strain (and, therefore, maximum stress) allowable\nfor the metallic structure, resulting in very conservative design.\nWhen taking into account the thermal residual stress effect arising\nfrom an elevated cure temperature, the material ranking could also\nchange [21]. Nevertheless, this paper has presented a worthwhile\nresearch that has established the modeling approach for bonded\nstructures and has explored the effect of strap stiffness for a wide\nrange of materials, from an isotropic ductile alloy to three composite\nlaminates, including a range of stacking sequences.\nC. Parametric Study: Strap Dimensions and Positions\nDifferent strap dimensions and positions were studied for a cross-\nply carbon-epoxy strap on the SENT specimen (Fig. 4b) made of\naluminum alloy 7085-T7651 (Table 1) with a thickness of 10 mm.\nThe load applied to the plate was \u0002 \u0001 53:57 MPa and the stress ratio\nwasR\u0001 0:1. To classify the different strap configurations, notations\nare defined as wXXdYYtZZ, where w is the width of the strap, d is\nthe distance between the strap edge and initial crack tip, and t is the\nthickness of the strap. For example, w25d50t0:5 defines a strap that\nis 25 mm wide, 50 mm from the initial crack tip, and 0.5 mm thick.\nThe goal is to maximize the number of cycles to failure (Nc)\ncompared with that of the unreinforced plate (NAl) and minimize the\nstrap weight (m) by working on the strap width (w), distance (d), and\nthickness (t). A parameter (e) was proposed. It indicates the\npercentage of life improvement with respect to the plain panel per\ngram weight of strap:\ne\u0001\nNc\u0006NAl\nNAl\n100\nm\n(9)\nTo limit the interactions between the different parameters and truly\nunderstand their effect on the FCG life, each design variable has been\nstudied by keeping the other constant. The distance d is the simplest\nand clearest parameter. The results are shown in Fig. 10. Examining\nFigs. 10a and 10b, we can say that the closer the strap is to the crack\ntip, the better it behaves in terms of both e andNc. Obviously, having\na strap very close to the crack tip would require a short gap between\none strap and the others, that is, a small strap pitch in the wing box.\nWedecided to keep the strap distance at 25mm from the crack tip and\nstudy the other two parameters.\nThe effects of thickness t and width w are more complicated. In\nFigs. 10c and 10d, one can see that e andNc are in an opposite trend.\nWhen Nc increases, e decreases; an absolute maximum cannot be\nfound. However, a useful tool has been developed to lead designers\nto the best possible strap choice once the life target and weight limit\nhave been decided. The interaction between the different design\nvariables (w and t) are included in this graph because the life is\nplotted for different strap widths and thicknesses. The so-called\nproject graph is presented in the next section.\nD. Project Graph\nThe project graph is a diagram showing the relation between strap\nvariables and fatigue life, which can lead the designers to the best\nstrap choice for a given life target (see Fig. 11). It has two y axes. The\nleft one is the percentage of life increment \u0001N [Eq. (10)], and the\nright y axis shows the percentage of the mass increment \u0001m\n[(Eq. (11)]:\n\u0001N \u0001 Nc \u0006 NAl\nNAl\n\u0007 100 (10)\n\u0001m\u0001 \u0004ms \u0002mAl\u0005 \u0006mAl\nmAl\n\u0007 100\u0001 ms\nmAl\n\u0007 100 (11)\nwhereNc is the FCG life of the platewith the strap,NAl is the FCG life\nof the substrate without the strap, ms is the weight of the strap, and\nmAl is the weight of the substrate.\nThe x axis shows the width ratio (ws=wAl \u0001 strap width\/substrate\nwidth). In the graph there are three pairs of curves. Each pair refers to\na specific thickness ratio (ts=tAl \u0001 strap thickness\/substrate thick-\nness) and is indicated by a different symbol (triangles, squares,\ncircles). Each pair has two curves; the solid line refers to the life\nincrement and is read on the left axis, and the dashed line refers to the\nmass increment and is read on the right axis. An example project\ngraph for the cross-ply carbon epoxy is shown in Fig. 11.\nDimensions, geometries, and load conditions are given in Sec. IV.C.\nThe example shown in Fig. 11 is explained as follows. First, a mass\nlimit should be decided; in this case, a weight increment of 6% is\nfixed. Consequently, the upper right part of the graph in the gray box\nof Fig. 11 cannot be accepted due to toomuchweight gain. Ifwewant\nto achieve a life improvement of 250%, we will go into the gray part,\nand this means that that level of life improvement cannot be reached\nwith the weight limit. If we want to achieve a life increment of 100%,\nwe will find two solutions, that is, w20d25t6 and w48d25t3 (see\narrows in Fig. 11). Between these two solutions, we can find the\nlighter one, that is,w20d25t6with a weight gain of 20 g, or nearly a\n3% weight increment.\n 60\n 70\n 80\n 90\n 100\n 110\n 120\n 90  95  100  105  110  115  120  125  130\n\u03c3\n,\n \nM\nPa\nacrit, mm\nCarbon UD t=0.5mm\nCarbon UD t=0.25mm\nCarbon CP t=0.5mm\nFig. 9 Crack length of complete disbond for three different strap\nconfigurations under different load values.\nBOSCOLO, ALLEGRI, AND ZHANG 2329\nTo summarize, using the project graph, one can find the strap\ngeometries with respect to the mass limit and life target and,\nmoreover, the lightest strap for the defined conditions.\nV. Conclusions\nAmodeling approach has been developed for predicting adhesive\ndisbond failure and fatigue crack growth life in substrates made of\naerospace aluminum alloys and bonded with crack retarder straps. A\nnovel feature is that the adhesive disbond growth is interactively\ncalculated rather than prescribed as a function of the of the substrate\ncrack length obtained from experimental data.\nThe effect of various strap configurations on the crack growth lives\nof the SENT specimen has been modeled to cover different strap\nmaterials, strap dimensions, and strap locations. In the cases of room\ntemperature cure, that is, in the absence of thermal residual stresses,\nthe important design parameters are identified as the elastic modulus\nof the strap material, strap cross-sectional area, and strap location.\nThe adhesive toughness is another influential parameter. Because\nhigh strap stiffness promotes early disbond due to high load transfer\nfrom the substrate to the strap, a tradeoff between the adhesive\ntoughness and the strap stiffness should be sought. When using\nlaminated composite straps, cross-ply laminates are advisable for\nweaker adhesives, because a complete disbond can be retarded. On\nthe other hand, for tougher adhesives, the best stacking sequence is\nthe unidirectional layup provided that under the load spectrum the\nstrap does not disbond completely. In terms of the strap position,\nthe closer the strap is to the crack tip, the better the life improvement\nwill be.\nFinally, when the aforementioned mentioned parameters are\ndefined, the best strap dimensions in terms ofwidth and thickness can\nbe found by using the project graph developed in this study.\nAppendix\nThe membrane stiffness of a laminate A can be calculated as\nfollows [31]:\nA \u0001\nXk\u0001Nl\nk\u00011\nZ\nhk\nhk\u00061\nCk dz\u0001\nXk\u0001Nl\nk\u00011\nCk\u0004hk \u0006 hk\u00061\u0005 dz (A1)\nwhere Nl is the number of layers, C\nk the material matrix for the\nkth layer, and hk the height of the kth layer.
