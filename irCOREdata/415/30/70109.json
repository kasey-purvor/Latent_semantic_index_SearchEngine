Loca-\ntion is a crucial component of context,\nand much research in the past decade\nhas focused on location-sensing tech-\nnologies, location-aware application\nsupport, and location-based applica-\ntions. With numerous factors driving\ndeployment of sensing technologies,\nlocation-aware computing may soon\nbecome a part of everyday life. \nLOCATION-SENSING TECHNOLOGIES\nA central problem in location-aware\ncomputing is the determination of\nphysical location. Researchers in acad-\nemia and industry have created numer-\nous location-sensing systems that differ\nwith respect to accuracy, coverage, fre-\nquency of location updates, and cost of\ninstallation and maintenance. \nCoarse-grained systems\nFor applications in open, outdoor\nareas, the Global Positioning System is\na common choice. A GPS receiver esti-\nmates position by measuring satellite\nsignals\u2019 time difference of arrival.\nAlthough GPS offers near-worldwide\ncoverage, its performance degrades\nindoors and in high-rise urban areas,\nand receivers have a relatively long\nstart-up time and high cost. \nIn 1989, Roy Want, Andy Hopper,\nand others pioneered the study of indoor\nlocation sensing with their infrared-\nbased Active Badge system. This pro-\nvides room-grained location using\nwall-mounted sensors that pick up an\ninfrared ID broadcast by tags worn by\nthe building\u2019s occupants.\nMany of the location-sensing systems\ndeveloped since then are based on radio.\nBy using base station visibility and sig-\nnal strength, it is possible to locate Wi-\nFi-enabled devices with accuracies from\nseveral meters to tens of meters. Blue-\ntooth technology, which offers a shorter\nrange than Wi-Fi, can give more accu-\nrate positioning, but at the expense of\nrequiring more fixed base stations to\nprovide coverage. Inexpensive radio-\nfrequency identification tags can be used\nfor location determination as well by\nplacing RFID readers at doorways and\nother strategic points to detect the pas-\nsage of people or objects.\nLocation information can also be\nderived from other types of RF infra-\nstructures, including those for mobile\nphones and TV broadcasts. These can\nbe deployed over a wide area with rel-\native ease, in contrast to technologies\nsuch as RFID that have limited trans-\nmission range. With mobile phones,\nCambridge Positioning Systems has\ndemonstrated location accuracies of 20\nmeters, while Rosum has achieved\naccuracies from 3 to 25 meters with\ndigital TV signals. \nFine-grained systems\nMany of the above systems are based\non technologies that were not devel-\noped with location sensing in mind.\nPerhaps as a consequence they exhibit\nmodest accuracy, generally measured\nin meters. However, at least three types\nof systems have been designed specifi-\ncally to provide fine-grained location\nsensing, achieving accuracies on the\norder of centimeters.\nUltrasound can be used to determine\ndistances between mobile tags and\nknown points in the environment. A\nprocess akin to triangulation can then\nbe employed to derive a location esti-\nmate for the tag. One type of ultrasonic\nranging device is the Cricket indoor\nlocation system developed at MIT,\nwhich is set to become available for\npurchase from Crossbow this year.\nSome computer vision-based sys-\ntems are appealing because they do not\nrequire users to wear any sort of tag.\nHowever, such systems have difficulty\nidentifying and simultaneously track-\ning many subjects. Vision-based sys-\ntems using barcode-like tags tend to be\nmore robust.\nUbisense, a company that builds\nreal-time local positioning systems,\nLocation-Aware\nComputing \nComes of Age\nMike Hazas, Lancaster University\nJames Scott, Intel Research\nJohn Krumm, Microsoft Research\nThe widespread \ndeployment of sensing\ntechnologies will make \nlocation-aware applications\npart of everyday life.\n96 Computer\nI n v i s i b l e  C o m p u t i n g\ning hardware, and a custom software\nplatform. A handful of firms offer these\nsystems in targeted application areas\nsuch as military training, human-body\nmotion capture, supply chain manage-\nment, and asset tracking. \nLooking ahead, numerous factors\nare accelerating the adoption of coarse-\ngrained location-sensing technologies.\nTo begin with, the recent explosion of\nWi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other wireless\nnetworking technologies has led to\nmany end-user devices being equipped\nwith RF hardware that can be used for\nlocation sensing. \nIn addition, the Enhanced 911\nrequirement\u2014which mandates that US\nwireless carriers provide location accu-\nracies of 50 to 100 meters for emer-\ngency 911 calls by the end of 2005\u2014\nis driving incorporation of location-\nsensing systems into mobile phones\nusing GPS, base-station triangulation\nmethods, and a combination of these\ntechnologies known as Assisted GPS.\nSimilar requirements exist in the\nEuropean Union.\nAnother important factor is a direc-\nrecently demonstrated a fine-grained\ntracking system that uses ultrawide-\nband radio signals. Unlike conven-\ntional radio signals, these signals can\nhave pulse durations short enough to\nallow accurate time-of-arrival and\nangle-of-arrival measurement, with an\naccuracy of about 15 centimeters. In\naddition, ultrawideband technology\ndoes not require a direct line of sight\nbetween tags and sensors.\nDEPLOYMENT\nFigure 1 shows the current and pre-\ndicted deployment of location-sensing\ntechnologies within the next two to\nthree years. The widest existing de-\nployments are based on GPS, which is\nparticularly suited for outdoor appli-\ncations. These include servicing appli-\ncations centered on vehicle location\nsuch as route planning and fleet track-\ning, as well as applications integrated\ninto handheld GPS units. \nOther current deployments are\nfound in vertically integrated solutions\nand comprise a specific location-aware\napplication, appropriate location-sens-\ntive by US retail giant Wal-Mart that\nrequires its top 100 suppliers to include\nRFID tags in their products by January\n2005. Current plans call for tagging\nitems by the case, but this may be\nextended to the tracking of individual\nitems in the future.\nIn addition to the deployment of sens-\ning technologies, increased hardware\nand software support is available for\nlocation-aware applications. For exam-\nple, mobile phones have emerged as a\nubiquitously deployed computing plat-\nform capable of downloading and run-\nning location-aware applications. Also,\nMicrosoft recently revealed that its next\nPC operating system, code-named\nLonghorn, will include location-aware\nsoftware components.\nABSTRACTING LOCATION \nTo provide support for a variety of\nlocation-aware applications, research-\ners are working on techniques for fus-\ning data from multiple sensors, on\nmethods for representing location data,\nand on drawing high-level contextual\ninformation from location data.\nSensor fusion\nVertically integrated location-aware\nsystems typically use one type of sen-\nsor for a single application. However,\nin the near future, many kinds of loca-\ntion sensors may be available to a par-\nticular client system. The task of\nmaking sense of this vast amount of\nsometimes contradictory information,\nknown as sensor fusion, presents a\nmajor challenge. \nBorrowing from the field of robotics,\nlocation researchers have settled on\nBayesian inferencing as the preferred\nmethod for processing data from dis-\nparate location sensors. Using Kalman\nfilters, hidden Markov models, dynamic\nBayes nets, and particle filters, they have\ndeveloped principled methods of incor-\nporating sensor uncertainty as well as\nlimits on speed and travel paths. \nThe result is a location measurement\nderived from multiple sensors and con-\nstraints that uses a probability distrib-\nution rather than a single value to\nM\ned\niu\nm\n(C\nus\nto\nm\n s\nys\nte\nm\ns)\nHi\ngh\n(C\non\nsu\nm\ner\n s\nys\nte\nm\ns)\nLo\nw\n(R\nes\nea\nrc\nh \nla\nbs\n)\nLocation accuracy\n1 cm 10 cm 1 m 10 m 100 m\nUltrawideband\nradioUltrasonic Vision\nRFID\nInfrared\nBluetooth\nTV\nGPS\nMobile\nphones\nWi-Fi\nDe\npl\noy\nm\nen\nt o\nf l\noc\nat\nio\nn-\nse\nns\nin\ng \nte\nch\nno\nlo\ngi\nes\nFigure 1.

For\nexample, researchers at the University\nof Washington have demonstrated an\nindoor location-measuring system that\nprocesses data from multiple sources,\nincluding infrared and ultrasonic sen-\nsors, using a particle filter. In addition,\nthe system learns typical walking paths\nthrough the building to aid in location\nestimation.\nRepresentation\nFinding a way to represent location\nreadings that facilitates storage, com-\nmunication, and interpretation is also a\nchallenge. Unfortunately, no single rep-\nresentation is useful in all circumstances. \nSensors tend to report locations as\nnumerical coordinates such as (x, y, z),\nbut semantic representation is more\neffective for application-level reasoning\nabout locations. Semantic representa-\ntions usually include a hierarchy of loca-\ntions such as (building, floor, room) or\n(country, state, city), and, like numerical\nrepresentations, also must include a\nnotion of uncertainty. \nSome applications, such as travel\nplanners, require both types of repre-\nsentations: Map-like coordinates are\nneeded to perform Euclidian distance\ncalculations, while information about\nterrain, traffic patterns, customs pro-\ncedures, and other factors is important\nto achieve accurate travel-time projec-\ntions. Due to the varying types of mea-\nsurements from different sensors and\nthe varying requirements of different\napplications, no dominant representa-\ntion for location has emerged.\nSensed locations are useless without\na location authority that gives a space\nof possible locations and can respond\nto queries about distances, routes, and\nproximity. Example location authori-\nties include WGS84 data for latitude\/\nlongitude and maps or floor plans in\ncomputational form.\nPlace and context\nSimply knowing that a person is \u201cat\nhome,\u201d \u201cin my office,\u201d or \u201cin my car\u201d\nis often sufficient for applications to\ncarry out predetermined actions in a\ngiven situation, such as turning off a cell\nphone\u2019s ringer during a film or concert.\nIn these cases, the person\u2019s relationship\nor interaction with a place is more\nimportant than the physical location. \nToward this end, location data can\nbe used to infer higher-level contextual\ninformation. For example, University\nof Washington researchers have used a\ntime sequence of GPS data to infer a\nperson\u2019s mode of transportation\u2014\nfoot, bus, or car. Others working at\nMIT have developed a location-aware\naugmented-reality museum guide that\nclassifies a visitor\u2019s movement patterns\nas \u201cgreedy,\u201d \u201cbusy,\u201d or \u201cselective\u201d and\ntailors its content accordingly.\nAPPLICATIONS\nIn addition to specialized applica-\ntions such as military training and asset\ntracking, location-aware applications\nhave been developed for a number of\neveryday scenarios: \n\u2022 office applications such as nearest-\nprinter services and mobile desk-\ntop control can increase work-\nplace productivity; \n\u2022 tour and museum guides can help\npeople navigate an unfamiliar\nspace; \n\u2022 \u201clocate my friends\u201d utilities can be\nlinked with instant messaging for\nsocial or business purposes; \n\u2022 conference aids can track presen-\ntation attendance and facilitate\nnote taking and discussion; \n\u2022 medical facilities can track staff\nand monitor patients for emer-\ngency response; and \n\u2022 home applications can help with\nhousehold management and home\nentertainment, as well as aid the\naged and disabled in performing\neveryday tasks.\nWhile coarse-grained location-sens-\ning deployments will enable some of\nthese applications, others will require\nfine-grained location-sensing systems.\nThe deployment of this additional\ninfrastructure will rely on an adequate\nreturn on investment. Unlike some\ntechnologies, fine-grained location-\naware computing does not appear to\nhave a \u201ckiller app\u201d to provide the\nrequired economic incentive. However,\nthe combination of benefits that many\napplications provide might justify\nwidespread adoption.\nA dvances in location-sensing tech-nologies and factors promotingwide-scale deployment will soon\nmake coarse-grained location informa-\ntion widely available. Recent achieve-\nments in sensor fusion techniques,\nlocation representation, and software\nsupport will facilitate the development\nof applications that can use this multi-\ntude of sensors. In time, fine-grained\nlocation systems and applications will\nbecome more economically viable.\nFor more information on location-\naware computing, visit www.cambridge.\nintel-research.net\/lac\/links.php.
