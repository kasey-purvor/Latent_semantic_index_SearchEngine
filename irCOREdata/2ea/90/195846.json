It \ndraws on data collected from female heads of \u2018girls-only\u2019 colleges in a region in Pakistan. The paper \nbriefly introduces leadership as a concept formulated in context. It presents philosophical and theoretical \nunderpinnings of these conceptualizations from an Islamic perspective as a case, and highlights the \ninterplay between belief systems, educational leadership and gender informed by the data and wide-\nranging literature. The paper deliberates how these discourses interact to formulate \u2018educational \nleadership\u2019 in Muslim societies, and explores the implications of these constructions for women in \neducational leadership in a Muslim society. The paper highlights the impact of cultural and belief systems \non notions and practices in the field of educational leadership. \nEducational leadership is being defined and theorised in multiple ways to encapsulate \nthe concepts, practices and perceptions in diverse contexts. However, theories and \npractices related to education in general and educational leadership in particular are \npredominantly ethnocentric, embedded in Western philosophy and values (Dimmock \n2000). Myriad definitions (Yukl 1998), and numerous theories of leadership \n(Richmon and Allison 2003) that are presented in the literature, are predominantly \nreflective of Western perspectives. Secondly, gender is often not confronted in \nleadership theories \u2018on the assumption that leadership styles and administrative \ncontexts are gender neutral\u2019 (Blackmore 1995, p. 103). The questions that arise here \nare two-pronged. First: \n Is there a hidden assumption that Western leadership concepts are \napplicable to all contexts; thus signalling a negation of knowledge and \nknowledge-sources other than ethnocentric for informing theory and \npractice? Or,  \n Does this point to an unwillingness to take up the challenges of \nexploring, understanding, analysing and theorising conceptual \nvariations and complex constructs? \nSecond: \n Is gender no longer an issue in educational leadership in the Western \nworld? And, \n Is it being assumed that gender is no longer an issue in educational \nleadership in all societies and cultures? \nWith increasing diasporas of communities of diverse cultures, ideologies, and faiths, it \nbecomes highly significant to understand how educational leadership is understood \nand informed by different cultural and belief systems, and how gender is experienced \nin educational leadership positions in different societies. This paper draws attention to \na knowledge gap in existing literature regarding educational leadership theory and \npractice as understood and informed by different belief systems - an issue which is \nforeseen as gaining higher significance with the fast changing population structures \nacross the world. My argument is that educational leadership concepts, theories and \n 2 \npractices evolve in context informed by cultural and belief systems (Shah 2006b). \nWith the changing societal structures, it becomes a prerequisite to work towards \ndeveloping complex theoretical constructs to re-conceptualize educational leadership, \ndrawing from perspectives held by diverse cultural and faith communities. Culture as \na category of analysis in this field has received some attention, but significance of \nfaith is still not acknowledged. The need is to recognise that people from diverse \nphilosophical, ideological and faith backgrounds conceive and perceive educational \nleadership differently, particularly across the gender divide, drawing upon their \nbeliefs, values and knowledge sources (Shah 2006a). This has implications for how \nleadership is exercised and practised in diverse cultural and faith communities. \nUnderstanding difference and working with it is a challenge as Derrida (Derrida 1976) \nargues by problematising \u2018difference\u2019, and pointing to the possibilities of multiple \nshifts of meaning and the subsequent implications. Derrida emphasizes that meaning \nof a \u2018sign\u2019 exists in relation to other things. If meaning is not \u2018present\u2019 within the sign, \nand if signs instead signify in relation to other things, haven't we been hanging on to \nmisconceptions and misconstructions in the field of educational leadership? \nThe paper debates philosophical and theoretical underpinnings of leadership \nconceptualizations and practices from an Islamic perspective as a case, highlighting \nthe complex interplay between belief systems and educational leadership, with a focus \non gender. This is primarily a conceptual paper, but also draws partly on direct data \ncollected from a qualitative study carried out in one region in Pakistan known as Azad \nJammu and Kashmir (AJK). AJK is one of the five major geographical regions in \nPakistan with many shared and some distinctive cultural features, and own provincial \ngovernment (Niaz 1992). This region was selected for the study first because no study \nof women in educational leadership had ever been carried out in that part of Pakistan, \nand second because this author had worked in that region in higher education for a \nlong time and had the opportunities of access. The sample included heads of all sixty-\neight single-sex colleges - both male and female \u2013 in AJK. The data was collected \nusing a semi-structured questionnaire to all the colleges heads, and twenty-eight one-\nto-one interviews (ten with female and fourteen with male college heads, and four \nwith senior educational leaders including one female), followed by two mixed-sex \ngroup discussions. However, the data used in this paper is drawn from the \nquestionnaires completed by the women college heads, from the eleven interviews \nwith the female participants, and from the women participants\u2019 contributions to the \ntwo mixed-sex group-discussions. The decision to draw upon the data collected from \nthe female participants only for the purposes of this paper is underpinned by the \nstance that: \nThe view point of the concrete other emerges as a distinct one only as a \nresult of self-definition. It is the other who makes us aware of her \nconcreteness and her otherness. Without engagement, confrontation, \ndialogue, and even a \u2018struggle for recognition\u2019 [sic] we tend to constitute \nthe otherness of the other by projection and fantasy or ignore it in \nindifference. (Ben-Habib 1992, p.168) \n  \n 3 \nCultural\/Belief Systems and Educational Leadership \nThe concepts of educational leadership and practices vary across societies and \ncultures. Different interpretations of leadership reflect ways of seeing and the \nphilosophical and theoretical assumptions behind them. Variations in interpretation \narise also because in different societies not only the philosophical anchoring of \nconceptualisations vary, but also because \u2018leadership derives power and influence \nfrom different formal or informal sources of position, person, knowledge, and \nwisdom\u2019 (Mullins 1995, p.229, also Busher 2006, Sergiovanni 1984). How a \nparticular society perceives and constructs educational leadership is influenced by the \ndominant cultural and belief systems prevailing in that society or community.  \nCulture and the ethos of leadership \u2018differ in fundamental ways across nations\u2019 \n(Fullan 1992, p.viii). Pugh and Hickson discuss education as a \u2018deeply cultural \ninstitution\u2019 (2003, p.11) where theory and practice are shaped by the values, beliefs, \nideologies, behaviour and conventions in that social system. Child (2003) makes a \nsimilar argument, using the Weberian framework of formal rationality and substantive \nrationality to explain the impact of ideational systems (cultural, religious and \npolitical) on social institutions, placing education on the top (p.42). Weber explicates \nrelationships between religious belief, individual attitudes and values, and social \naction. He defines religion as a cultural system (1963), and points to its role in \ndetermining \u2018action\u2019 on social (and educational) sites. He argues that \u2018social action\u2019 is \nconceptualised and enacted in different institutions determined by ideational systems \n\u2013 the way a community perceives reality. Weber explains the concept of religion as a \nsystem of symbols and beliefs, which via its effects on the consciousness of the \nbeliever can decisively mould and direct the content of social action (Weber, 1963). \nRecognising the role of material interests, he emphasises the impact of ideational \nsystems: \nNot ideas, but material and ideal interests, directly govern men's (sic) \nconduct.  Yet very frequently the 'world images' that have been created by \n'ideas' have, like switchmen, determined the tracks along which action has \nbeen pushed by the dynamic of interest. (1958, p.280) \nThe extent to which religious belief systems influence social action is determined by \nthe role a religion or belief is accorded in a community. Geertz (1973) explains \nreligion as a meaning-making process which guides men (sic) and helps them to give \nmeaning to their existence. A religion is broadly speaking, a set of beliefs and \npractices generally held by a human community, involving adherence to certain \nbeliefs and rituals. Members of that faith community participate in related activities \ninformed by their ideological and cultural knowledge \u2013 transmitted from generation to \ngeneration, and learned through living and sharing as its member. It is this \u2018tacit \nknowledge\u2019 (Polanyi, 1967) gained and internalised through \u2018habitus\u2019 (Bourdieu, \n1977) that guides perceptions and actions.  \nMany recent studies have explored the interplay between culture and leadership. \nHofstede\u2019s landmark study, which focuses on business management, highlights the \nrelationship between culture and leadership practices, citing examples from diverse \nsocieties to draw attention to the effect of societal culture on leadership concepts and \npractices (Hofstede 2001). Walker and Dimmock (2002), discussing the impact of \n 4 \nsocietal and organizational cultures on leadership theory and practice in education, \nargue that the notion of educational leadership is formed in the backdrop of values, \npatterns of behaviour and ideologies of a community. In Muslim societies, education \nand educational leadership are influenced by the religious teachings deriving from the \nsacred texts, as is the case with many other belief systems. For example, the \npatriarchal notion of leadership and its moral dimension in China draws its power and \nresponsibilities from the social ideology drawn from Confucius, and functions within \nthat value system (Tung 2003, Wong 2001). In Buddhist society, \u2018six essential virtues \nof the Bodhisattva code of the Mahayana Buddhist wisdom tradition: generosity, \ndiscipline, patience, joyous effort, meditation and wisdom\u2019 (McClain 2007, p.1) play \nan important role in defining leadership role and practices. In Shinto ideology, \nleadership power derives from the notion of family as the main mechanism by which \ntraditions are preserved (Ono 1962).  \nThe post-modern world is experiencing a religious resurgence (Ahmed and Donnan \n1994, Bauman 1997, Esposito 2002) drawing attention to the potential role of belief \nsystems in shaping and controlling human activities in different fields. In education, \nthere is a growing recognition of the impact of diverse cultures, values and religious \nbeliefs on leadership practices. However, the field of education tends to avoid \nengaging with faith and its interplay with culture as a category of influence with \nregard to how leadership is understood and exercised.  \nIslam, Educational Leadership and Gender \nEducational leadership in Islam derives from Islamic philosophy of education, \ninformed by the religious texts (Abdullah 1982, p.43), which reinforces the interplay \nbetween faith and conceptualisations\/practices. The Islamic philosophy of education \ndraws from the belief that God, the ultimate knower, \u2018taught to man the knowledge of \nthings\u2019 (the Quran, 96:1-5). This raises knowledge and knowledge-sharing to the level of \ndivine activity:  \nGod will raise in ranks those of you who believe as well as those who are given \nknowledge. (The Quran, 58:11) \nThe prophets, otherwise ordinary human beings, have elevated status in Islamic theology \nbecause of their knowledge (The Quran, 27:15; 2:247). People of knowledge and \nlearning guide the learners nearer to God and are attributed the highest status as the \n'heirs of prophets' (Al-Bukhari, Vol-1). This association between religion and \nknowledge creates a discourse of educational leadership, which elevates it to a sacred \nduty of the highest order (Shah 1999 Talbani 1996).  \nThe emphasis in Islam is on learning for all (Al-Attas 1979, Ashraf 1995) irrespective \nof gender, and other variants (the Quran, 49:13). In practice, female access to education \nis constrained in many Muslim societies (Griffin 2006), confining them to the domestic, \nwith implications for their leadership role. This is where religion is interpreted \ndifferently within different societies, leading to gendered conceptualisations. Discourses \nof gender are located in cultural settings and national contexts. Any discussion of \nwomen in educational leadership that \u2018ignores important factors such as cultural \ndifferences, economic and social-political divisions, race and nationality, religion and \nidentity would not only be unrealistic but may present a distorted picture\u2019 (Oplatka \n 5 \nand Hertz-Lazarowitz 2006, p. 3). The discourse of \u2018female leadership\u2019 is determined \nnot simply by the biological gender (Blackmore 1999, Oplatka 2001, Reay and Ball, \n2000), but by how biological gender is constructed in a particular society at a \nparticular time in history. How gender is constructed and experienced in the Muslim \nsociety of Pakistan is linked to the country context: \nThe social and cultural context of Pakistani society is predominantly \npatriarchal. Men and women are conceptually divided into two separate \nworlds. Home is defined as a woman\u2019s legitimate ideological and physical \nspace, while a man dominates the world outside the home. The false \nideological demarcation between public and private, inside and outside worlds \nis maintained through the notion of honour and institution of purdah in \nPakistan. Since the notion of male honour and izzat (honour) is linked with \nwomen's sexual behaviour, their sexuality is considered a potential threat to \nthe honour of the family. Therefore, women\u2019s mobility is strictly restricted and \ncontrolled through the system of purdah, sex segregation, and violence against \nthem. (ADB 2000, p.2) \nIn the broadly segregated society of Pakistan, single-sex institutions are projected as \nan important feature of Muslim culture which has led to the development of two \nalmost separate sectors of education \u2013 male (mardana) and female (zanana). Women \ngenerally have marginal participation in mixed-sex settings and institutions. \nAccordingly, the positions of leadership occupied by them are either tokenistic, or \ngender-specific or in the women-only institutions. This sex-segregation provides \nwomen a context to exercise leadership in an \u2018infiltration-free zone\u2019, but this also \nraises questions regarding female participation on desegregated sites and its \nimplications for more public female leadership roles.  \nMoreover, religion in this case, acts as a determining factor in how gender roles are \ninscribed in private and public and how discourses are legitimised. This has \nsimilarities with many Muslim societies, such as the Arab states where similar \nsystems of segregation prevail (Kirdar 2006). The argument is that discourses are \nnever free of history, power and interests (Foucault 1980, p. 131). Muslim women \nexperience \u2018marginality both in their professions and in the public mind\u2019 (Curry 2000, \np. 4), at the interstices of faith and societal culture, which need to be explored to \nunderstand how leadership is informed by cultural\/belief systems.  \nThis paper therefore attempts to present perspectives of Muslim women educational \nleaders, coming from a specific region, supported by a wide range of international \nliterature. Women\u2019s lives in Pakistan itself do not form a homogeneous entity. \nDepending on geographical location, a Pakistani woman can be \u2018a highly qualified \nand self-confident professional or a modest domesticated housewife, leading an \nextremely isolated life cut off from all decisions and information\u2019 (Qureshi 2004, p. \n3). The nature of female leadership role and women leaders experiences are \ninfluenced by the situated framework of the social structure and its ideological basis \nthat determine sex roles, organisational practices, and power relations. The discussion \nfocuses on dominating discourses in Islam such as sex-roles, family, \nsegregation\/veiling, and moral code\/Izzat, and explores their implications for women \neducational leaders and leadership conceptualisations. The aim is to highlight the \n 6 \ninterplay of cultural and belief systems in determining how leadership is understood \nand conceptualised. \nSex Roles and Educational Leadership \nDoing an analysis of 180 countries from 1975 to 2000, Gray et al (2006) argue that \n\u2018gender is one of the few modes of differentiation that has social, cultural, political, \nand economic implications everywhere in the world\u2019 (p. 294). In countries such as \nAmerica (Ozga 1994), India (Nayyer 1985), New Zealand (Strachan 1993), Britain \n(Wilson 1995), Europe (Wilson 1997) and the Third World (Davies 1992) it may be \ndiverse factors interacting at different levels to define sex roles for women. \nNevertheless, common to all societies and cultures seems to be an implicit belief that \nmale\/female difference implies female association with domestic, nurturing, caring \nroles. In Muslim societies also there is \u2018a general identification of women with the \nsphere of domesticity\u2019 (Afshar 1987, p. 3), achieved through emphasising the verses \nhighlighting women\u2019s nurturing role towards the family (the Quran, Sura 4). Many \nMuslim female writers (Afshar 1987, Ahmed 1992, Al-Hibri 1982, Badawi 1994; \nMernissi 1991, El Saadawi 1989) argue that this association between women and \ndomesticity is a feudal patriarchal interpretation of religious texts: \nPatriarchy co-opted Islam after the death of the prophet - many passages in the \nQuran were interpreted by patriarchy loosely and out of context, in support of \na vicious patriarchal ideology. These interpretations were then handed down to \nwomen as God's revealed words. (Al-Hibri 1982, p. viii)  \nThe Quran being the core of religious knowledge and the main source \u2018to produce, \nlegitimise, and operationalize truth in a Muslim society\u2019 (Nasr 1981, p. 49), power \nlies with those who have control over religious interpretations. The Arab society, \nwhere Islam was first introduced, was a highly patriarchal society. Later Muslim \nsocieties, in spite of the Quranic teachings to the contrary, marginalised women, often \nconstraining them to the domestic, as has been the case generally with feudal \npatriarchal cultures. The Quran is explicit about women being masters of their own \npossessions and earnings, saying that, \u2018Unto men a fortune from that which they have \nearned, and unto women a fortune from that which they have earned\u2019 (4:32), clearly \npointing to options of performing in the public space. However, this participation is \nconstrained in most Muslim societies in the name of religion, confining women either \nto domestic roles, limiting them to supportive roles, or redefining the professional role \nwith gender connotations as in the case of women educational leaders.  \nGender-specific socialisation constrains roles for males and females. Deriving from \nthe wider societal cultures, positions of power and authority are viewed as gender-\nspecific (Adler et el 1993, Davies 1992, Hall 1996, Kirdar 2006, Ouston 1993, Ozga \n1994, Shakeshaft 1991, Strachan 1993). Women who are leaders are \u2018seen as being in \nthe wrong place\u2019 (Gold 2006). They are stereotyped negatively as leaders and \nmanagers, and are often pre-judged as failures: \n[M]en are assumed to possess any necessary competence, until such time as \nthey demonstrate otherwise, but women need most positively to establish the \nfact of their competence before this will be recognised\u2019 (Spencer and Podmore \n1987, p.134) \n 7 \nGender emerges as a significant force in determining organisational roles, influenced \nby multiple factors such as culture, religion, ideology, socio-economic systems and \nmany others (Ahmed 1992, hooks 1990, Ouston 1993). Gender is \u2018a structuring code \nas well as cultural expression\u2019 (Hey and Bradford2004, p.698). When women are in \nleadership roles, \u2018psychological phenomenon caused by cultural beliefs and societal \nattitudes of how women should behave and what role they should play\u2019 (Farouk 2006, \np.444) becomes a burden to manage. Skeggs contends that: \n\u2026 positioned as members of a social group with a fixed identity, rather than as \nindividuals who perform an identity, the agency and autonomy of women \nworkers is always limited by the social category of gender. (2004, p.55) \nThe public\/private and nature\/culture divides, underpinned by histories of feudal \npatriarchal cultures, scribe the complex interplay of cultural norms. Consequently, \nwomen leaders\u2019 professional experiences become scripted by their position as women \nin their micro-cultures. Even when in leadership roles, cultural and belief systems \nredefine leadership for women, deterring them from identifying with the role of leader \n(Al-Khalifa 1992), as explained by a participating woman leader: \nThe culture in our country is to limit the women within their houses; their \nmovements have to be in accordance with the cultural expectations even when \nprofessional demands are otherwise \u2026 It creates problems. The women think \nof themselves more as Muslim women than managers and leaders. (PF1) \nBlackmore (1995) argues for a de-construction of masculinist notions of leadership \nand invites us 'to question what is not included in the discourse as much as what is' (p. \n96). The significance of gender with regard to female experiences across professions \nand societies make it important to take into account \u2018women\u2019s experiences of \ngendered power relations ..... [as] a source of knowledge\u2019 (Ramazanoglu 1993, \np.209). It is recognition of the gender element and of power differentials instituted \nthrough given discourses, produced culturally and socially to exercise power, because: \nAs individuals, they cannot be separated from the society and culture in which \nthey work and in which assumptions about men and women in public and \nprivate, in work or at family, prevail. (Hall 1996, p.12) \nThe roles of women leaders in Pakistan reflected these \u2018assumptions\u2019. The leadership \npractices often conformed to the gender stereotypes in the wider social order. \nWomen-only colleges offered aspiring women an opening of space in the public. \nHowever, the structural denominations inscribed the roles and practices, reinforced by \nthe socio-cultural practices where 'traditional patterns of behaviours prescribe certain \nroles to which individuals, males and females, partially conform to differing degrees' \n(Blackmore 1995, p.121). The roles of female college heads were discursively \nconstructed through historically inscribed discourses of what it was to be a Muslim, a \nwoman, and in the \u2018domestic\/public\u2019, according to given interpretations of religion in \nthat culture: \nI am a wife and mother first. The Quran says that it is my first responsibility to \nlook after my family. I accept that, but at times it stretches me to the limit! \n 8 \nEven when I have to work late in office, I cannot miss any of my domestic \nduties --- I am a woman. (PF3) \nThe simple statement at the end of the quote was made in a very matter-of-fact way, \nwith no obvious inflections, but it clearly signals how leadership in the case of women \nis informed by cultural and belief systems. \nFamily, Women and Leadership \nThe women leaders participating in this study emphasised aspects of professional life \nwhere family affected their role and practices. In Islam, family is the basic social unit \n(Shah 2006a), which serves as a reference for rights and duties. Islam is very \nemphatic about significance of family and its priority in different matters. However, \nfamily in different societies and cultures \u2018remains a primary arena where men exercise \ntheir patriarchal power\u2019 (Hartmann 1981, p.377). This was reflected in the \nparticipants\u2019 responses who overwhelmingly believed that looking after their family \nwas the first priority of a Muslim woman; therefore, they avoided taking any \nprofessional responsibility which could affect their family\/extended family set up: \nI am planning to give up principal-ship. Government is transferring me to \nanother town, and my husband and in-laws don\u2019t agree with the move. It will \naffect children also. My father-in-law is old and I have to look after him as \nwell. The in-laws and even other relatives will criticise that I am after career \nand do not care for family responsibilities. Family comes first --- How can I \nchoose to continue? (PF6) \nA nurturing responsibility towards the \u2018family\u2019 encouraged prioritising of domestic \nrole to the extent of a willing acceptance of confinement to the domestic through \ngiven interpretations of the notions of motherhood and family (Brock et al 2006): \nWomen have responsibilities of family and children. We all wish to stay \nnearer to our homes so we could look after our homes. (PF4) \nHowever, many scholars (Ahmed 1992, Badaawi 1994, Mernissi 1991) argue with \nreference to the religious texts that domestic responsibilities of Muslim women are \nnot obligatory but optional. Siddiqi (1996) emphasises that \u2018According to strict \nIslamic injunctions, it is not obligatory for a woman to cook the food for her husband \nor children, or to wash their clothes or even to suckle the infants\u2019 (p.57). It is argued \nthat emphasis on domestic role of women is culturally produced and not a religious \nproclamation. Raj (1982) mentions complaints by Indian women (mostly Hindu by \nfaith) about combining home and job duties, and its being a barrier to professional \nprogression, which emphasises cultural orientation of these gender related issues. \nTraditionally, family has served as a convenient space for exercising control, with \nspecific implications for gender. In Pakistani culture, intricate networks of \nrelationships and obligations in the family virtually deprive women leaders of \nprofessional power in the name of family. Islamic teachings and injunctions regarding \nthe immediate and extended family are reinforced by the local patterns of behaviour \nconcerning family and over-riding \u2018family obligations\u2019 (Shaw 1988, p.165): \n 9 \nA lecturer\u2019s post has been advertised for my college. I as principal am to sit on \nthe selection committee. My in-laws have asked my husband to get a \nparticular candidate appointed. My dilemma is that the person does not qualify \n\u2026 if I get her appointed it is professionally incorrect and if I don\u2019t get her \nappointed then my family life will be misery \u2026 you know my husband being \ntold that his wife does not listen to him. (PF9) \nBy deploying socio-cultural discourses and practices, family is converted into a space \nof oppression. For the women college heads leadership meant the intricate balancing \nof family\/extended family priorities and wishes, and professional responsibilities in \nthe face of all the challenges posed in a feudal, patriarchal, segregated society. \nHowever, paradoxically, the dilemma of a public activity such as educational \nleadership in a segregated society is resolved to some extent in the case of women \ncollege heads by re-inventing the site as \u2018family\u2019 and re-locating it within the \ndomestic: \nThe college is a family, an extended family. The head has to manage the same \nway as a family head, treating each one according to one\u2019s positioning. (PF3) \nThis re-invention aimed at appropriating power through reverse discourses of family \nand motherhood. Motherhood emerges as a position of power in the network of \nrelationships, with particular emphasis on the status of mother (Badaawi, 1994; \nAbdalti, 1994). By constructing colleges as \u2018family\u2019, the \u2018excluded\u2019 \u2018segregated\u2019 \nwomen college heads moved into a discourse where they could lay claims to power \nand authority as mothers, sanctified by the Quran and the Hadith: \nWe are like a family. When there are problems we discuss them within family. \nI have suggested a theory to my staff: when a student comes to you treat her as \nyour own child and deal accordingly. (PF11) \nApparently they felt safer and stronger in managing the institutions, students and staff \nfrom a position of status and authority within the religious discourse. Whether they \nexperienced balancing of different roles as 'a source of pressure' (Al-Khalifa 1992, \np.96) or not assumes secondary significance in view of the empowerment achieved \nthrough fusion of the personal and the professional. Although in many Muslim \nsocieties, women appear to be deprived of their religious rights in the name of family \npeace and interest (Afshar 1987, p.132), the research participants highlighted \nadvantages associated with the institution of family. Family provided a sense of social \nsecurity in a cultural context where moving into public space was discouraged as un-\nIslamic, with threats of social victimisation: \nStaying close to family protects you from social victimisation. You know how \ndifficult it is for women to work in positions like this. You have to \ncommunicate with men and influential people. And what our society is like! \nHaving a strong family helps \u2013 people are careful in talking about you, and \nlisten to what you have got to say even though you are a woman. (PF2) \nFamily was the safe heaven providing a reliable network and a source of protection, in \nspite of all associated cultural connotations of responsibility, constrained decision \nmaking, limited mobility, marginalisation and segregation. \n 10 \nSex-segregation\/Veiling and Leadership \nLeadership is underpinned by visibility, while veiling and segregation aim for \ninvisibility. The essential tension between the two makes it a challenge to define \nfemale leadership in segregated societies. However, the participating Muslim women \nleaders did not see the two as contradictory, although they did acknowledge it as a \nsignificant factor shaping female leadership roles as well as posing certain challenges \nin practice. The nature of sex-segregation in Islam and how it is practised in Muslim \nsocieties is a complex debate. The rhetoric emphasises it as an Islamic injunction, but \nin the sacred texts it is a relative concept recommended so far as it is essential to \nmaintain the social fabric of a Muslim society (Shah 2007). Islam discourages mixed-\nsex settings because of its potential threat to Islamic societal structure, and provides a \nmoral code for men and women operating in the public space (the Quran, Sura 4). \nVeiling is also linked to the value of modesty in Islam, and although its essential \nprinciples apply to both men (the Quran, 24:30) and women (the Quran, 24:30), \n\u2018double moral standards\u2019 for men and women (Afshar 1994), and culturally \nconstructed practices of segregation create given discourses of veiling (for details \nconcerning \u2018veiling\u2019 in Islam see Abdalti 1994, Afshar 1994, Ahmed 1992, Maududi \n1995, Mernissi 1991, Siddiqi 1996) and associate those with women, problematising \ntheir participation in the public. \nWomen colleges in Pakistan are officially termed zanana (for women) colleges while \ncolleges for men are called mardana (for men). The construction of women-only \ncolleges as zanana shifts the site from the public to the domestic\/familial\/private with \nall the associated connotations of power differential, and: \nMen get angry if a woman is appointed in a senior position mainstream. Their \nstand is that women should be selected for women only posts but not for open-\nto-both ones... As long as we are in subordinate positions, there is no problem. \n(PF1)  \nThe Muslim women in powerful leadership positions feel powerless because of the \ncultural \u2018gendered ideological foundation of authority\u2019 (Luke 1996, p.289). For \nexample, these principals officially have powers as \u2018drawing\/dispersing officers\u2019, but \nin practice all matter related to purchases, invoicing, bills and payment are delegated \nto the accountants because finance offices and banks are the \u2018male domains\u2019 \n(mardana). For a woman it would be a violation of social norms to move into \u2018male \ndomains\u2019, and here cultural\/belief systems determine the role and domain of a woman \ncollege head:  \nI wish there was a way that we could deal directly [and not through the clerks] \nwith the banks. Our women managers suffer a lot because of social norms and \npressures. It is inappropriate for women to visit banks or other male offices. \n(PF5) \nA woman principal has \u2018to think a few times even before deciding to visit a male \ndominated public space on her own\u2019 (PF1). Some did mention that they went to these \nmale offices occasionally, but accompanied by a male member of the family for the \nsake of appropriateness. Power differentials and gender demarcations, legitimised in \nthe name of religion and culture, defined a gendered concept of leadership in a society \n 11 \nthat practised and approved sex-segregation. Structural constraints such as all-male \noffices and predominantly male support staff, cultural traditions of male supremacy, \nand the religious notion of sex-segregation interacted to formulate a specific concept \nof female leadership for these Muslim women. They often chose to be low profile, \nself-effacing and complying, \u2018seen but never heard\u2019 (Belenky 1986, p.32), a \nconsequence of both self-policing and social control (Foucault 1980). Although \nwomen leaders appear to have different ways of coping with powerlessness\u2019 \n(Lamphere 1994, p.220), that does not mitigate the issues of de-voicing and silencing. \nThe following quote from one female college head illuminates the point:  \nIn general, attention is not paid to women\u2019s words. Their opinion regarding \nany official matter is not given that weight as a man\u2019s word. Then, being a \nwoman, it does not seem appropriate to argue with men. (PF3) \nWomen leaders confined into the private space of girls\u2019 colleges, appear to be \ndisciplined by the patriarchal norms and given religious discourses. An interesting \nstory relevant here was narrated by one participant: \nThe secretary education was to preside over the Annual Prize Distribution in a \nmale college. The local divisional director colleges (DDC), a female (the first \nwoman divisional director colleges), was not invited by the college principal \nto that ceremony, contrary to the usual practice. When it was brought to the \nsecretary\u2019s notice, he advised the lady (DDC) on phone to be present at the \noccasion. She went to the college at the appointed time ... The principal was \nangry to see her and told her rudely that no seating arrangements had been \nmade for women. \nA female educational leader who is in immediate authority over the male principal is \ndenied a professional right and a simple human courtesy because of her gender. The \nfact is that women bring their femaleness with its connotations and status in society \nwith them when they enter professions. There is no doubt that patterns of power and \nsubordination are not just gendered, they are also cut across and transformed by class \nand other social formations (Weiner 1990). Feudal patriarchal orientation of Muslim \nsocieties in general (Ahmed 1992), and the given interpretations of sexuality and \nfamily law in Islam appear to strengthen patriarchal practices (Mernissi 1991), \nsubjecting women to segregation and veiling which negatively affect their \nparticipation in the professional space.  \nSex-segregation draws on the Islamic discourses of sex, chastity and morality. Chaste \nwomen keep away and \u2018veiled\u2019 from men except mehrams (Shah 1998). This had \nimplications for the women college-heads confined to the zanana colleges, who had \npositional power and authority but it was limited to the segregated site. Paradoxically, \nwomen heads of zanana colleges also felt protected by the \u2018walls and veils\u2019, which \nkept the intruders out (Helms 1995). This provided women leaders a space in which to \nmanoeuvre without the threat of open interference and blatant pressures. In spite of \nthe obvious disadvantages such as issues of mobility, socio-professional net-working, \nbarriers to career progression, and many others the women leaders felt advantaged by \nthe comparative protection of the zanana, conforming to a concept of female \nleadership underpinned by cultural and belief systems. \n 12 \nGendered Moral code and Concept of Izzat \nIzzat is a powerful discourse that determines women leaders\u2019 professional practices \nand roles in Pakistan. The term embodies enormously powerful cultural judgements. \nFemales are expected to uphold the honour of the family, community and almost \neveryone else, through a strict maintenance of an honour code defined often by males. \nThese honour codes are gender discriminatory and highly marginalising for women, \npromoting male control by subjecting women to \u2018surveillance\u2019 and \u2018disciplining\u2019 \n(Foucault 1980). The research participants consistently referred to observance of \nIslamic moral code and values while defining leadership for Muslim women. \nHowever, the discourse is manipulated to \u2018blackmail\u2019 women into silence and \ninvisibility:  \nWe and our girls are responsible for family izzat. A breath of scandal and that \nnot only ruins your professional future and career but also upsets family life \u2013 \neven destroys it. That is a stigma, and a woman with this stigma gets sidelined \nin the professional field as well. You become excluded \u2013 at home and in the \nprofession. Better play it safe --- keep your head bowed and protect your izzat. \nMuslim societies often proclaim to follow a specific moral code which they term as \nIslamic moral code, and assert that it derives from the Quran and the Sunnah. The \nQuran recommends basic principles of a moral code and the life of the prophet as \nmodel (the Quran, Sura 33) to all its followers regarding how to conduct themselves \nmorally and socially. However, diverse interpretations of this moral code are \nstructured in different Muslim societies. The high emphasis on values of modesty and \nchastity in Islam is often constructed socially as gender-specific. These values are \nlinked to family honour (Izzat) and women are made into bearers of these values. The \nnotion of Izzat (honour) draws from the Quranic teachings (17:23-24; 31:14-15; \n46:15), but in practice, it is defined by cultural systems. By making women solely \nresponsible for izzat (Afshar, 1994, p.129), it is given a gendered description which \nhas serious implications for women operating in the professional and the public. \nBroadly speaking, the notion of izzat for women implies acceptance of prevailing \nsocial norms: submission to the male authority (Weiss 1994) in all matters concerning \npersonal, professional, social, economic and others; capitulation to \nrestricted\/proscribed mobility; observance of sex-segregation; and, withdrawal from \nthe public. Women leaders performed under high pressures because of the societal \nnorms and the associated fear of 'gossip', 'scandal' and character assassination'. They \npreferred to remain 'invisible in the interest of family izzat' (PF3), and often left \nvisible mainstream leadership positions for men. They believed that the risks involved \nin moving across the boundaries were too many: \nIf you are a woman, you would be immediately labelled as immoral. If a male \nvisits your office a few times consecutively, you would be declared having an \naffair with him. I once travelled for an official meeting with a married male \ncollege head, and there was another male colleague in the car. I stayed in a \nwomen\u2019s hostel and returned with a family. When I got back, I learned that a \nlocal paper had published a news item about my affair and engagement with \nthat head. ... It is a serious problem [for women]. The norms in our society \npermit men to do any thing \u2026 that is all OK. ... The moral standards for men \nand women are the same in Islam, but there are immense social pressures [for \n 13 \nwomen]. If a women\u2019s reputation is affected no one would marry her; and it \nwould affect her career also. (PF11) \nThe fear of interpretations and consequences to family izzat effectively discouraged \nnot only movements but also communications across the boundaries. Women were \ndisciplined into segregation and silence in anticipation of the possible social threats. \nEven communication by telephone had to be culturally appropriate, requiring a \ncircumscribed use of the facility: \nBeing a woman principal, I occasionally do face problems. Then I talk to the \nconcerned male personnel on phone. If the problem is not solved I have to \nmake a second call; but there would be a hijab (hesitation) this time. I find it a \nbit difficult to talk to men on phone. [sic] I intentionally try to avoid the \nsituation. (PF4) \nThe skewed codes of conduct constructed by male authority posed threats to women \nleaders who may chose to move in the positions of visibility. Participation in the \npublic was made into a challenge as attributes like \u2018seditious, corrupt, or prostitution\u2019 \nwere \u2018granted freely to women but not to their male \u2018accomplices\u2019\u2019 (Afshar 1987, p. \n74). According to the research participants, localised social and behavioural norms \nmarginalised women because being women they were easy victims to 'social \nindictment'. Character assassination emerged as a tool paradoxically linked with the \nnotion of izzat. Women felt that they were often playing in a defensive position, as \none participant angrily complained: \nIf a woman works with male colleagues, there is a scandal. There can be \nrelationships without corruption! (PF8) \nAn effective leadership role was premised on being perceived as a good Muslim \nwoman of moral values and character; however, what it meant to be a good Muslim \nwoman was vague and subjective. \nFraming Gender, Leadership and Muslimness \nEducational leadership for women in Pakistan is framed in a discourse of Muslimness. \nHow these Pakistani Muslim women understand and define educational leadership is \ninformed by the relevant cultural and religious belief systems \u2013 what it means to be a \ngood Muslim as understood and interpreted in that culture. I am not implying any \nhegemonic discourse of Muslimness. My argument is that concepts and practices are \nlocated in contexts, and these constructions take place at the interstices of interacting \nvariants. What educational leadership means for Muslim women leaders can not be \nde-linked from their Muslimness and associated culture. A stepping outside the \ndominant religious and cultural discourses may not be good for their sense of self, and \nprobably for the leadership practices as well. Conversely, the risk is the way \ninterpretations become monopolised and fixed. In such situations, the need increases \nfor un-fixing, re-negotiation and re-interpretation of discourses with a view to \nunderstand situated concepts and practices.  \nSex-segregation is generally critiqued as depowering and marginalising for women. \nFor my research participants, it created a space for exercising leadership in the \n 14 \ndomain of women-only institutions. However, the concept and practices of leadership \nwere redefined in accordance with the cultural and belief systems for the sake of \ncultural appropriateness and religious legitimisation. The women leaders did not \nperceive the religious norms of conduct problematic for their professional role. \nHowever, separate patterns and standards of conduct\/character applied to men and \nwomen were socially endorsed as propounded by Islam; and women, by not having \naccess to places of interpretation submitted to those, which had serious implications \nfor their professional roles specifically with regard to participation in the public, and \npersonal and professional mobility. Bernstein's in his interesting discussion of \nknowledge and control states:  \nThe way a society selects, classifies, distributes, transmits, and evaluates \neducational knowledge reflects both the distribution of power and the \nprinciples of social control. (1977, p.47)  \nThe management practices of the college heads were underpinned by the religious, \nsocio-cultural, and professional discourses. The women educational leaders in this \ncontext performed within the gender discourse which, in this case, had its roots in \ninterpretations of religion and the status of women in Islam. These appeared to be \ndeliberately wielded and indicated \u2018how truth is implicated and deployed in social \npractices and how \u2018regimes of truth\u2019 can have profound social and cultural \nconsequences\u2019 (Beechy and Donald 1985, p. xiv). These discourses opened discursive \nfields to the Muslim women college heads to position and redefine themselves. The \ndiscourse of human equality in Islam (the Quran, 3:195; 4:1; 4:124; 33.35; 49:13) \nencouraged women leaders to seek career progression and professional participation \nbut a counter \u2018cultural\u2019 discourse of gender difference imposed constraints. \nMovements within and across the discourses of gender, culture and religion were \nsituation-determined, and continuously changed priorities. This endorses that an \nanalysis and theorising of roles and practices needs to be worked within the \nparameters of these constructed discourses, informed by cultural and belief systems. \n \nReferences \n \nAbdal\u2019ati, H.
