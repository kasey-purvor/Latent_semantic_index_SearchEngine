Introduction\nButterfly colour patterns have evolved as mecha-\nnisms for visual communication such as camouflage,\nsexual signalling, warning colouration (aposematism),\nand mimicry. Biologists have been interested in the\ndevelopmental origin and evolutionary diversification\nof these patterns for more than a century. Early work\nfocussed on the comparative morphology of patterns\nand explored various ways in which the pattern re-\nsponded to experimental perturbation during devel-\nopment. Comparative morphological studies revealed\nthat a great unity underlies the diverse patterns of\nmoths and butterflies. Most butterflies and many moths\nhave patterns composed of discrete elements whose\nhomology can be traced across genera and families\nas easily as the homologies among the bones of the\nvertebrate skeleton. The system of homologies among\npattern elements is now called the nymphalid ground-\nplan [1\u20133]. Experimental work on pattern perturbation\nrevealed that some of the elements of the nymphalid\nground plan, such as the bands of the central symme-\ntry system, the eyespot-like border ocelli, and the mar-\nginal pattern elements develop around discrete orga-\nnizing centres. These organizing centres are special-\nized groups of cells that occur at various locations on\nthe wing surface and on the wing margin and send\nout signals that affect the spatial pattern of pigment\nsynthesis in their vicinity [3]. More recent investiga-\ntions on the nature of these organizing centres have fo-\ncussed on the developmental genetics of eyespot pat-\nterns. This work has revealed several genes that are\ninvolved in the development of the organizing centres\nand various aspects of the morphology of the eyespots\n[4,5]. In parallel to the experimental work, several in-\nvestigators have attempted a variety of approaches to\nthe mathematical modeling of butterfly colour patterns\n[6\u20138]. Below we present a brief review of the current\nstatus of this modeling effort.\n1.1. General features of butterfly patterns\nButterfly colour patterns are essentially two-dimen-\nsional patterns of pigment synthesis. A fraction of\nthe epidermal cells on each wing surface differentiate\ninto scale cells (see, e.g., [9,10]), which send out a\nlarge flat appendage, the scale, into which pigments\nare secreted. With few exceptions, each scale cellsynthesises a single type of pigment [11,12]. The\noverall colour pattern is thus constructed as a fine-\ntiled mosaic of coloured scales. One of the problems\nof pattern formation is how a particular scale cell\nis induced to synthesise the right pigment for its\nparticular location on the wing.\nButterfly wing patterns are highly organised. Each\npattern is built up from a standard array of pattern ele-\nments. This general organising principle of colour pat-\nterning was first discovered in the family Nymphalidae\n[1,2], and hence has become known as the nymphalid\ngroundplan [3]. Species-specific colour patterns de-\nvelop because of the selective expression or suppres-\nsion of individual pattern elements and due to the de-\nvelopmental regulation of the exact shape and pigmen-\ntation of each element. Butterflies outside the family\nNymphalidae appear to use subsets of the pattern ele-\nments of the nymphalid groundplan [3,11].\nThe position and shape of each element of the\ncolour pattern are controlled by signalling sources at\nvarious locations on the wing surface. The wing veins\nand the wing margin appear to be the primary induc-\ntive sources for pattern formation [3,11]. Pattern deter-\nmination in butterflies has been shown to occur in two\nstages. The first stage consists of the specification of\norganising or signalling centres on the undifferentiated\nwing surface. In species where this has been studied,\nthis process occurs during the early to mid portions of\nthe last larval stage in the still growing wing imaginal\ndisk [3,13]. The second stage consists of the defini-\ntion of the boundaries of the future patterned synthe-\nsis of each of the pigments that will make up the pat-\ntern, which are established by signals generated by the\norganising centres. This process occurs late in larval\nlife and continues into the early pupal stage [3]. This\nsecond stage results in an invisible spatial prepattern\nof cell commitment to a particular pigment synthetic\npathway. Actual pigment synthesis does not begin un-\ntil the end of the pupal stage, a few days before emer-\ngence of the adult butterfly.\n1.2. What problems can be addressed through the\ninteraction of experiment and modeling?\nOne of the attractive features of butterfly wing pat-\nterns from an analytical and theoretical viewpoint is\nits two-dimensional nature. Each wing surface is a flat\nand essentially static monolayer of cells. Hence pat-\nH.F. Nijhout et al. \/ C. R. Biologies 326 (2003) 717\u2013727 719tern formation is not due to the migration of deter-\nmined cells into particular patterns, as occurs in colour\npattern formation in vertebrates, but due to the local\ndifferentiation of cells in response to processes of cell-\nto-cell communication. This static two-dimensional\nnature of the colour pattern makes it a particularly at-\ntractive target for simulation modelling of pattern for-\nmation, because the full system can be represented on\na two-dimensional display, without the need to col-\nlapse dimensions. Moreover, the fact that cells do not\nmigrate relative to each other greatly facilitates mod-\nelling because the wing can be represented as a static\ngrid.\nMathematical modelling of pattern formation, or of\nany other system for that matter, can have two primary\npurposes, depending on the amount of information that\nis available about the actual mechanisms of pattern\nformation that operate in a given situation. If a lot\nis known about the mechanisms that generate pattern\nin a particular system, then mathematical models can\nbe developed by writing the relevant equations for\nthe known processes and determining whether these\nare sufficient to generate the desired pattern, given\nrealistic initial and boundary conditions. The results\nof such simulations will reveal whether all necessary\ncomponents have been identified. If a system can\nbe fully simulated, then the mathematical model can\nbe used to investigate how the system would behave\nunder a broad variety of experimental conditions.\nThe value of such an approach is that it enables an\ninvestigator to do virtual experiments of a kind that\nmight not be feasible in the real system.\nIf relatively little information is available about the\nunderlying mechanisms that give rise to the patterns\nunder consideration, then mathematical modelling can\nsometimes be used to discover the minimally suffi-\ncient conditions that can generate the desired pattern.\nThere is no guarantee, however, that such minimally\nsufficient conditions will also prove to be necessary\nconditions, because in many situations, a number of\ndifferent equally parsimonious models could produce\nthe desired result. In order for this style of modelling\nto converge to the real mechanism it is necessary to\nimpose constraining conditions by which alternative\nmodels can be eliminated. In biological patterning sys-\ntems such constraints are provided by pattern diversity\nand by the response of the pattern to experimental and\ngenetic perturbation.The enormous diversity of patterns poses a particu-\nlarly powerful constraint. In many cases, closely re-\nlated species have different patterns, yet because of\ntheir genetic similarity such discrepancies can be as-\nsumed to be due to quantitative differences in the un-\nderlying generating mechanisms, rather than to qual-\nitative differences [3]. Hence, if a particular model\nmechanism cannot produce the pattern diversity seen\nin closely related species by simple variation in pa-\nrameter values, then the model is unlikely to repre-\nsent an accurate summary of the underlying patterning\nmechanism. Similarly, if the model under considera-\ntion cannot accurately reproduce the response of the\npattern to mechanical injury, or to various mutations,\nit is unlikely to accurately represent the actual mech-\nanism of pattern formation. In butterfly wing pattern\nformation the above approach has been used to elimi-\nnate a broad diversity of candidate model mechanisms,\nbecause these cannot produce the requisite diversity\nof patterns [14]. Only one particular form of a reac-\ntion diffusion mechanism proposed by Meinhardt [15]\nproved to be capable of producing the correct mor-\nphology and diversity of locations of the signalling\ncentres that control eyespot development [14]. In Sec-\ntion 3, we deal with globalpatterning, which cover\nwhole wing surfaces, and we will take as an illustrative\nexample of the general patterning principle of local-\nactivation-lateral inhibition (LALI) this version of the\nGierer\u2013Meinhardt model [16]. It is important to note\nthat in this latter case this is not the only specific model\nthat will produce appropriate results on global pattern-\ning. This means that we cannot use computational re-\nsults in Section 3 to distinguish between models. On\nthe other hand, it does mean that the behaviour we are\nobserving is generic to the LALI class of models.\n2. Eyespot patterns\nThe development of eyespot patterns in the Nym-\nphalidae is, at present, the best understood mechanism\nof pattern formation (see Fig. 1). Eyespots develop\naround small groups of cells that act as signalling\nor inducing sources. If these cells are killed early\nin development, the eyespot fails to develop [17,\n18], and if these cells are transplanted to a different\nlocation on the wing they induce an ectopic eyespot in\ntheir new surroundings [17,18]. Species of butterflies\n720 H.F. Nijhout et al. \/ C. R. Biologies 326 (2003) 717\u2013727Fig. 1. Eyespot patterns in a butterfly wing.\ndiffer in the number of eyespots on their wing,\nin the exact location of these eyespots, and in the\nsize and pigmentation of these eyespots. Hence, in\norder to understand eyespot formation it is necessary\nto understand how the organising centres come to\nbe where they are and the mechanism by which\nthey induce specific pattern of pigment synthesis in\ntheir surrounding. The interaction of mathematical\nmodelling and experimental perturbation has played a\nkey role in developing our current understanding of\nthese processes.\nNijhout [14] showed that point-like patterns can\nbe produced in the exact locations of the organising\ncentres by an activator\/inhibitor reaction\u2013diffusion\nmechanism that assumes that the wing veins act as\nfixed boundary conditions for the activator and as\nreflecting boundaries for the inhibitor. In biological\nterms this implies that the veins, or cells associated\nwith the wing veins, are sources of one of the diffusing\nreactants. Variation in parameter values can displace\nthe positions of these point-like patterns, and mimic\nthe effect of certain mutations on the positions of\nthe centres of eyespots (e.g., [19]). These reaction\u2013\ndiffusion models can be quite sensitive to small\nvariation in parameter values and initial conditions.\nHowever, it has been shown that pattern selection can\nbe robustly controlled under certain types of boundary\nconditions and also with domain growth [20,21].\nThe mathematical model predicted a rather com-\nplex time evolution of the spatial pattern of activator\nconcentration, before it settles to point-like pattern at\nthe stable steady-state [14]. Several years later, Carroll\net al. [13] demonstrated that the gene Distal-less is ex-\npressed uniquely in the cells of the organising centresof eyespots. Moreover, the spatial pattern of expres-\nsion of Distal-less undergoes exactly the same com-\nplex changes as those predicted by the mathematical\nmodel [13,22]. It appears therefore that Distal-less is\nsomehow associated with a portion of the patterning\nmechanism that behaves as the activator in a reaction\u2013\ndiffusion system.\nOnce the point-like patterns are established, these\nin turn begin to act as organising centres for the induc-\ntion of pigment synthesis in their vicinity. Mathemat-\nical simulation results of timed cautery experiments\non the size of the subsequent eyespot diameter sug-\ngest that a signal spreads out from these centres with\ndynamics that resembles diffusion [3,23]. It appears\ntherefore that the cells that express Distal-less begin\nto produce a signal that propagates by diffusion into\nthe adjoining cells and somehow induces these cells\nto synthesise the pigments appropriate for an eyespot.\nCarroll and his co-workers have demonstrated that the\nexpression of several genes spreads out in a circular\npattern from the site of Distal-less expression. Among\nthese genes are spalt, cubitus interruptus, engrailed,\nand, interestingly, Distal-less itself [4,24]. Genes such\nas Bigeye, Cyclops and Comet affect the diameter and\nshape of the eyespot [19,25\u201327] and must thus some-\nhow be involved in controlling the spread of expres-\nsion of these early genes.\nThe pigments of eyespots consist of melanin in the\ncentral disk and outer dark ring, and ommochromes\nin the outer pale-coloured ring [11]. How these genes\ncontrol specific pigment synthesis in eyespots has\nnot yet been investigated, but the control of pigment\nsynthesis in other portions of the pattern in swallowtail\nbutterflies (Papilionidae) has been investigated by\nKoch et al. [28]. These authors have shown that\nthe switch between yellow and black pigmentation\nin the wing of Papilio glaucus involves regulation\nof the expression of the enzyme dopa decarboxylase\n(DDL) which is required for the synthesis of both\nblack melanins and yellow papiliopochromes, and the\nenzyme N-b-alanyl dopamine-synthase (BAS) which\nis required for the synthesis of yellow papiliochromes.\nYellow pigment synthesis occurs first in development\nand is caused by the spatially patterned high activity\nof BAS and a low activity of DDL in presumptive\nyellow regions of the wing. This is followed by a\npatterned high activity of only DDL in the areas\nof the wing that will become black. Mutations that\nH.F. Nijhout et al. \/ C. R. Biologies 326 (2003) 717\u2013727 721turn yellow areas of the wing black appear to act by\ndecreasing the initial low level of activity of DDL in\npresumptive yellow areas, followed by a rise in DDL\nactivity at the time it occurs in the normally black\nareas of the wing. It appears therefore that a relatively\nsimple switch, involving the patterned activation and\ninhibition of two enzymes, can regulate the pattern\nof synthesis of the principal pigments on butterfly\nwings. An interaction among genes like spalt, Distal-\nless and engrailed must be involved in controlling\nthe expression of these pigment-synthetic enzymes,\nbut exactly how this regulation works remains to be\nelucidated.\n3. Global patterning\nGlobal pigmentation patterns on lepidopteran\nwings, which cover whole dorsal or ventral wing\nmonolayers, can be very complicated in structure and\nthey are sometimes used for identification of species.\nOwing to the pioneering work of Schwanwitsch [1]\nand S\u00fcffert [2] on the nymphalid ground plan, the\ncomplicated patterns on the wings can be understood\nas a composite of a relatively small number of pat-\ntern elements. For example, (1) the symmetry system\nconsists of colour bands that run anterior to posterior\nacross the wing; (2) the border ocelli system consists\nof a series of eyespots in the distal half of the wing;\n(3) the marginal bands are a pair of narrow bands near\nthe wing margin; (4) the dependent patterns are ve-\nnous stripes, that is, a colour pattern of the outline of\nthe wing veins; (5) the ripple patterns run proximal to\ndistal in the wing in a manner similar to the ripples in\nwind-blown sand [3].\nIn spite of these simplifications, the problem of\nglobal colour pattern formation in wings is still not\nfully resolved and there exist very few mathematical\nmodels to account for the diversity of colour pattern in\nwings. We briefly review them in the next section.\n3.1. Models for global pattern formation\n3.1.1. Diffusing-morphogen-gene-activation\nmodel [6]\nA simple model for the development of the com-\nmonly observed crossbands of pigmentation shortly\nafter pupation was proposed by Murray [6]. Thismodel is based on a diffusing-morphogen-gene-activa-\ntion system and extends the idea of a determination\nstream proposed by K\u00fchn and von Engelhardt [29],\nnamely, that the anterior and posterior margins of the\nwing are sources from which emanates a wave of mor-\nphogen concentration. Murray\u2019s model hypothesises\nthat the morphogen activates a gene product which,\nin turn, determines colour pattern. The model equa-\ntions are solved either on a sector of a circle, repre-\nsenting a wing, or a rectangle, representing a wing\ncell with appropriate boundary conditions [6,23]. Mur-\nray showed that this simple model could exhibit a\nwide variety of observed patterns. For example, it ex-\nhibits patterns consistent with those observed after mi-\ncrocautery surgery. The theoretical results are consis-\ntent with the observations of Schwantwitsch [1]. Vary-\ning the scale and geometry of the model wing leads\nto more complicated patterns that are consistent with\nthose observed on certain butterfly and moth wings,\nwhile considering the model on a wing cell and vary-\ning the source strengths also leads to commonly ob-\nserved patterns.\n3.1.2. Simple diffusion model [7]\nA simple diffusion mechanism of a single mor-\nphogen was proposed for the formation of the wing\npigmentation patterns of three species of butterflies by\nBard and French [7]. Their model is based on three\nmain assumptions. First, there may be morphogen\nsources in the foci of eyespots and morphogen sinks\nat some parts of the wing margin. Second, the mor-\nphogen has a finite half life and diffuses simply and\nfreely away from the sources throughout a wing of\nhexagonally packed cells. Third, the overt pattern de-\nrives from cells interpreting the local morphogen con-\ncentration with respect to thresholds which determine\nscale colours. The final pattern follows lines of con-\nstant morphogen concentration and may, depending on\nthe distribution of sources, comprise rings, curves, or\nbands. With a biologically realistic diffusion constant\nand a morphogen half life less than 6 h, the model can\ngenerate many features of butterfly wing patterns as\nstable patterns of morphogen concentration, the com-\npound spots of Tenaris domitilla, the large rings of Di-\naethria marchalii and the pattern of eyespots, rings and\nasymmetric bands of Ragadia minoa [7].\n722 H.F. Nijhout et al. \/ C. R. Biologies 326 (2003) 717\u20137273.1.3. Reaction\u2013diffusion model [8]\nA reaction\u2013diffusion model on a geometrically ac-\ncurate wing domain was presented for the formation\nof global pigmentation patterns in the butterfly wing of\nPapilio dardanus by Sekimura et al. [8]. The model is\nbased on the idea that a system of reacting and diffus-\ning chemicals could evolve from an initially uniform\nspatial distribution to concentration profiles that vary\nspatially \u2013 the so-called diffusion driven instability\n[30]. By mathematical analysis and computer simula-\ntions of the model equations, Sekimura et al. suggested\nthat the global wing colouration is essentially due to\nunderlying stripe-like patterns of some pigment induc-\ning morphogen. This model does not need to assume\nsupplementary morphogen sources and sinks in some\nparts of the wing to get patterns. They also highlighted\nthe importance of key factors such as parameter values\nfor mode selection, threshold values which determine\ncolour, wing shape and boundary conditions.\nIn the next section, we review the reaction\u2013diffusion\nmodel in some detail with brief description of the but-\nterfly, Papilio dardanus, and present some new com-\nputational results.\n3.2. A reaction\u2013diffusion model for global pattern\nformation in the butterfly wing of Papilio dardanus\n3.2.1. Wing colour patterns of the butterfly\nPapilio dardanus\nThe species of butterfly Papilio dardanus is widely\ndistributed across sub-Saharan Africa and well known\nfor the spectacular phenotypic polymorphism in fe-\nmales. The females have evolved more than a dozen\ndifferent wing colour patterns, many of which mimic\ndifferent species of unpalatable butterflies and moths.\nThe female wing patterns are quite complicated\nand diverse, and at first glance it seems difficult\nto find an underlying logical relationship between\nthem, although they are clearly due to simple genetic\nvariation in a single species. Nijhout [3] recognized\nthat the black portions of the colour pattern constitute\nthe principal pattern elements. These elements differ\nin size and shape in different mimetic forms, and\nthis variation can have dramatic effects on the overall\nappearance of the pattern. Our goal, therefore, is to\npresent a mechanism that need account for only the\nblack pattern elements.In contrast to the spectacular phenotypic poly-\nmorphism in females, the males are monomorphic\nand strikingly different from the females, exhibiting\na characteristic yellow and black colour pattern and\ntailed hind wings. Some populations of Papilio dar-\ndanus have females with male-like colour patterns.\nThese male-like females can be distinguished from\nnormal males by a slightly broader area of black along\nthe basal anterior margin of the forewing, and a lobe-\nlike extension of this dark pattern from the anterior\nwing margin (Fig. 2). Genetic heterozgotes of such\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 2. (a) Male (top) and (b) male-like female (bottom) forms\nof Papilio dardanus. The male-like female forms can be strictly\ndistinguished from normal males by a lobe-like extension of black\npattern from the anterior wing margin.\nH.F. Nijhout et al. \/ C. R.

Numerical results\n3.2.3.1. Mimetic and non-mimetic patterns in females.\nIn a previous paper [8], we demonstrated that our\nmodel can account for many aspects of the pigmen-\ntation patterning in the wing of Papilio dardanus. One\nof the main results was that wing colouration would\nbe reproduced by assuming there was a simple un-\nderlying stripe-like pattern of some pigment-inducing\nmorphogen. We also emphasised that the diversity of\nfemale colour patterns can be obtained by variation\nof only a few key factors such as parameter values\n724 H.F. Nijhout et al. \/ C. R.

The boundary conditions for the forewing are illustrated in (d).for mode selection, threshold values that determine\ncolour, wing shape and boundary conditions. These re-\nsults could be important from a genetic point of viewbecause they may give us insight into the mechanisms\nby which a single genetic locus [31\u201333] could control\nthe entire diversity of patterns observed.\nH.F. Nijhout et al. \/ C. R. Biologies 326 (2003) 717\u2013727 7253.2.3.2. Maleand male-like femalepatterns. From the\nmathematical point of view, the male patterns are es-\nsentially different from the male-like female patterns.\nWe assume that the male patterns are related to para-\nmeter values (d and \u03b3 in Eqs. (1) and (2)) selected to\nisolate the (1,0) mode on a unit square domain. On the\nother hand, the structured male-like female patterns\nare assumed to be related to the parameters isolating\nthe (3,0) mode on a unit square, which could generate\nother female patterns such as hippocoon. The length\nscales of the wing domains are approximately equal to\nthose of the unit square.\nIn all our numerical simulations for male-like\nfemale patterns we fix parameter values as follows:\na = 0.1, b = 1.0, k = 0.5, \u03b3 = 619.45 and d =\n70.8473. The numerical simulations show the plots\nof v only. The profiles of u can easily be deduced\nfrom these plots as they are in phase with those of\nv. We further assume that cells within the wing are\nnot necessarily homogeneous in their response to one\nof the chemical concentrations, in this case v. We\ntherefore specify a threshold function of the form of a\nplane \u03b1 y+\u03b2 x+c0 where \u03b1 or \u03b2 or both are non-zero\nand c0 is a non-negative constant. Here colouration or\nshading is determined as follows: if cells experience\nchemical concentration v \u0001 \u03b1y + \u03b2x + c0 they are\nblack, otherwise they become coloured. Note that if\nboth \u03b1 and \u03b2 are zero, then the threshold gradient is\nreduced to a constant threshold, while if one of \u03b1 or \u03b2\nis zero, then cells are homogeneous in one direction\nbut have a response gradient in the other direction.\nThere is no biological evidence to justify the existence\nof a gradient threshold. However, there is experimental\nevidence [9,10] that cells do have other properties\nsuch as adhesivity, that depend on distance from the\nbody. The shading parameters for the hindwing are\nfixed as \u03b1 = 0.0111, \u03b2 =\u22120.025. The fixed parameter\nvalues for the forewing are \u03b1 =\u22120.0111, \u03b2 =\u22120.025\nand c0 is varied to obtain different patterns. The\ngradient threshold values are determined by trial\nand error. The forewing and hindwing domains are\nconsidered independent, hence numerical simulations\nare independently carried out on each domain.\nIn Fig. 4, we show results of numerical simulations\nof the Gierer\u2013Meinhardt model (Eqs. (1) and (2))\ncorresponding to male and male-like female patterns\nof Papilio dardanus in Fig. 2. The boundary conditions\napplied here and the parameter values are such thatonly one minimum in morphogen concentration is\nobtained.\n3.2.3.3. Intermediate male-like female patterns. In\nFig. 5, we also present numerical simulations of\nthe model for intermediate male-like female patterns\nshown in Fig. 3. As noted above, we assume that male-\nlike female patterns result from parameters that isolate\nthe (3,0) mode on a unit square. By choosing different\nboundary conditions, a transition from one minimum\nto two minima of the morphogen concentration v of\n(Eqs. (1) and (2)) in the two-dimensional patterning\ndomain can be observed. Fig. 5 shows the results of\nnumerical simulations illustrating some intermediate\npatterns. Here, the boundary conditions differ from\nthose used to simulate the male-like female pattern in\nFig. 2. By changing the value of c0 of the threshold\nfunction (c0 = 0.6625, 0.661 and 0.655), we generate\nsome intermediate patterns ranging from more or less\na typical male-like female pattern (Fig. 5a) to an\nextreme pattern with two separate white parts in the\nwing (Fig. 5c) similar to hippocoon.\n3.2.4. Predictions from the model\nTo illustrate how our model could be used as\na predictive tool, we consider the following two\ncases (for more details, see [35]): (i) cutting part of\nthe forewing by simply removing part of patterning\ndomain, and (ii) making a hole in the forewing. Our\nsimulations results (not shown here) on the effects\nof cuts in the wing blade predict that large cuts will\ncause significant alterations of the pattern, whereas\nsmall cuts results in minor or no changes in the\npattern. Holes in the wing do not appear to have major\neffect on pattern formation. This latter result differs\nfrom the finding of K\u00fchn and von Engelhardt [29],\nwho showed that holes in the wing could severely\nalter the banding pattern on the wings of Ephestia\nkuhniella. The colour patterns of Papilio dardanus\nare, however, not homologous to the banding pattern\nof Ephestia [3], and arise by a mechanism that is\nquite different form that envisioned by K\u00fchn and von\nEngelhardt. Our findings have significant implicatons\nfor understanding how the evolution of colour pattern\nis influenced and perhaps constrained by evolutionary\nchanges in wing shape.\n726 H.F. Nijhout et al. \/ C. R. Biologies 326 (2003) 717\u20137274. Conclusions\nTo understand pigmentation pattern formation in\nbutterfly wings, it is important to determine the mech-\nanism by which signalling molecules activate pigment\nsynthesis and are spatially distributed in the wing. The\nbest understood mechanism of pattern formation is\nthat of eyespot pattern formation, in which the spa-\ntial pattern of expressions of the gene Distal-less and\nseveral genes have been examined.\nIn contrast to the case of eyespot patterns, where\nthe results of experiments on surgery, and genetic\nstudies, exist, little is known for global patterns, as\nyet, for Papilio dardanus, although the mechanism\nof the so-called H locus, which has been assumed to\ncontrol the mimicry of a species of butterfly Papilio\ndardanus, has been well studied. The extension of the\nstudy of male to intermediate male-like female colour\npatterns has once again reinforced the conclusion\nthat such varied patterns can be exhibited by small\nchanges in the parameter values of the underlying\nmathematical model. According to our results, the\nkey factors are parameter values related to mode\nisolation, that is, parameter values within the model\nthat excite a particular pattern while damping down the\nother patterns, wing shape, boundary conditions and\nvariation of threshold values, which seem to be in good\naccordance with experimental evidence. Indeed, it is\nknown that the effects of boundary conditions such\nas morphogen signalling sources, boundary shape\nand threshold function that determine the colour, are\nimportant to understand pigmentation pattern in the\nbutterfly wing.\nThe generality of our numerical finite element\nmethod has allowed us to investigate other biologically\nobserved patterns related to the butterfly wing of Pa-\npilio dardanus. Such effects can easily be investigated\nmathematically\/computationally in the model equa-\ntions without any change in the numerical finite ele-\nment technique developed by our group. In particular,\nwe were able to use our model equations to hypotheti-\ncally predict the effects of shape change to global and\nlocal pattern formation [35]. Furthermore, this advan-\ntage makes the numerical technique a powerful tool in\ninvestigating other biologically related problems (see\nfor example [36]).\nIt is known that the pigmentation process occurs\nas the butterfly wing imaginal disc grows from thelate larval stage to the adult. Future research will\nfocus on investigation of pattern forming processes\nduring development of the wing disc. Modelling will\nalso aim to investigate growth on a realistic domain\ngeometry for the butterfly wing to determine under\nwhat conditions the observed adult wing pattern is\nformed.\nAcknowledgements\nTS was supported by a Grant from the Human\nFrontier Science Program (GR0323\/1999-M) and also\nby a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the\nMinistry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture of\nJapan (No. 14034258).
