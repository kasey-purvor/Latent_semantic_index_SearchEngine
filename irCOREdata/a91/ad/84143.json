Correspondence e-mail:\nkenneth.shankland@stfc.ac.uk\nThe simulated annealing approach to structure solution from powder diffraction\ndata, as implemented in the DASH program, is easily amenable to\nparallelization at the individual run level. Modest increases in speed of\nexecution can therefore be achieved by executing individual DASH runs on the\nindividual cores of CPUs.\n1. Introduction\nDASH (David et al., 2006), a computer program for structure solution\nfrom powder diffraction data, which has recently been adapted to run\non distributed computing systems, can also be run efficiently on a\nsingle computer having more than one CPU, or (as is increasingly\ncommon) a single computer containing a CPU with multiple cores.\n2. MDASH overview\nMDASH is a graphical user interface (GUI) driven program that\ntakes, as input, files generated using DASH and controls their\nexecution on a single standalone PC. Full details of this file genera-\ntion and subsequent execution by DASH are given in a paper\ndescribing GDASH (Griffin et al., 2009), and only program aspects\nthat are specific to MDASH are discussed here.\n3. Program description\n3.1. Running jobs using MDASH\nOn runningMDASH, a user selects a .grd file generated previously\nusing DASH, whereupon MDASH displays a summary of the job\n(Fig. 1). Pressing the \u2018Start\u2019 button will commence the job. DASH is\ninvoked byMDASH with an execution priority of \u2018below normal\u2019 and\nall detected CPU cores are used, although these settings can be\nconfigured by the user.MDASH constantly monitors and displays job\nprogress, and by default, when a job is complete, MDASH invokes\nthe normal GUI version of DASH to display the results.\n4. DASH program performance when invoked using MDASH\nThe performance of MDASH running on a PC equipped with a\n2.4 GHz Core2Quad CPU and a PC equipped with dual quadcore\nXeon 2.5 GHz CPUs has been evaluated using the moderately\nchallenging optimization problem of solving the crystal structure of\nfamotidine form B (Shankland et al., 2002; P21\/c, V = 1421 A\u02da\n3, Z0 = 1,\n13 degrees-of-freedom, 1.64 A\u02da resolution) from synchrotron X-ray\npowder diffraction data. In order to generate easily measurable\nexecution times, the total number of simulated annealing (SA) moves\nper run was set to 1\u0001 107, about a factor of ten higher than is actually\nnecessary to solve the structure. The results are summarized in Table 1\nand show essentially linear scaling with the number of available cores.\n5. Software and hardware environment\nMDASH itself runs under MS Windows XP (SP2) and MS Windows\nVista and requires the MS .Net 2.0 Framework (or higher) to be\ninstalled; this is present by default in XP SP2 and Vista. No installer is\nrequired; one simply places the MDASH.EXE file in a convenient\nlocation and creates a shortcut to it if desired. Although MDASH\nitself has very modest memory requirements, given that the program\ninvokes multiple copies of the DASH executable, it is desirable to\nhave as much memory as possible installed on the PC on which it is\nrunning. The exact amount required depends upon the size of the\nproblem being studied with DASH, but as a general rule, we would\nrecommend at least 2 GB RAM for a quadcore PC and at least 4 GB\nRAM for a dual quadcore setup.\nFigure 1\nThe main MDASH window, showing the parameters and files for a DASH job.\n\u2021 Present address: Avant-garde Materials Simulation, D-79100 Freiburg,\nGermany.\n5.1. Prerequisites\nIn order to deployMDASH correctly,DASH Version 3.1 or higher\nmust be installed on the PC on whichMDASH is installed. Note that\na site licence is not necessary in order to have more than one copy of\nthe DASH executable running on a standalone PC.\n6. Documentation and availability\nThe MDASH executable is supplied as an \u2018unsupported extra\u2019 in the\nDASH Version 3.1 software distribution available from the\nCambridge Crystallographic Data Centre. WhilstMDASH itself does\nnot require a licence, it does require a licenced copy of DASH in\norder to operate.\nWe are grateful to Elna Pidcock and Wei Dong of the CCDC, and\nto Alastair Florence and Norman Shankland of the University of\nStrathclyde, for their help in testing and validating GDASH.\nReferences\nDavid, W.
