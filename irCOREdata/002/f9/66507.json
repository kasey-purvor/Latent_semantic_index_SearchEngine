The accuracy with which it is known has improved\nsteadily as the size of the redshift surveys used to deter-\nmine it has grown (e.g. Efstathiou, Ellis & Peterson 1988;\nLoveday et al. 1992; Marzke, Huchra & Geller 1994; Lin et\nal. 1996; Zucca et al. 1997; Ratcliffe et al. 1998; Folkes et\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS\n2 P. Norberg et al.\nal. 1999; Blanton et al. 2001; Madgwick et al. 2002). Here,\nwe present an estimate of the bJ-band luminosity function\nfrom the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) which is\ncurrently the largest galaxy redshift survey in existence. The\nluminosity function is an important statistic in its own right\nand understanding how it arises is a major goal of models\nof galaxy formation (e.g. White & Frenk 1991; Katz, Hern-\nquist & Weinberg 1992; Kauffmann, White & Guiderdoni\n1993; Cole et al. 1994, 2000; Somerville & Primack 1999;\nPearce et al. 2001). Also, to exploit the 2dFGRS fully, it\nis important to have an accurate model of the luminosity\nfunction so that the selection function of the survey can be\ndetermined. This is a vital ingredient in analysing all aspects\nof galaxy clustering using the survey.\nThis paper presents an estimate of the overall bJ-band\ngalaxy luminosity function. This estimate takes account of\nk-corrections (which result from the redshifting of the wave-\nlength range covered by the bJ filter) and also average evo-\nlutionary corrections. We also include the effects of photo-\nmetric errors and small corrections for incompleteness in the\nsurvey. We demonstrate that the dependence of the incom-\npleteness on surface brightness is small, but we do not in-\nclude any explicit surface brightness corrections. These will\nbe discussed in Cross et al. (2002b). The analysis presented\nhere is complementary to that in Madgwick et al. (2002) and\nthe earlier analysis in Folkes et al. (1999). In these cases a\nsubset of the 2dFGRS data were analyzed with the primary\naim of establishing how the luminosity function depends on\nspectral type. These papers did not apply evolutionary cor-\nrections since they were not attempting to model the full\nselection function of the survey. We compare and discuss our\nresult in relation to these and other recent determinations\nof the luminosity function, including that from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS). We also compare estimates for\ndifferent regions of the survey to test the uniformity of the\ncatalogue and our model assumptions. Throughout, we use\nmock galaxy catalogues constructed from the Hubble Vol-\nume N-body simulations (Evrard 1999; Evrard et al. 2002)\nin order to check our methods and to assess the influence of\nlarge scale structure upon our results. We also use the esti-\nmated luminosity function and our modelling of the survey\nselection limits and completeness to produce a complete de-\nscription of the 2dFGRS selection function in angle, redshift\nand apparent magnitude. The predictions of this selection\nfunction are compared with various properties of the real\ncatalogue including the galaxy number counts and redshift\ndistributions.\nThe paper is divided into 11 sections. In Section 2 we\ndescribe the relevant details of the 2dFGRS. The technical\ndetails of the calibration and accuracy of the APM and 2dF-\nGRS photometry are discussed in Section 2.1. In Section 3\nwe use independent data from the SDSS to review the reli-\nability of the 2dFGRS redshifts and investigate various as-\npects of the completeness of the 2dFGRS photometric and\nredshift catalogues. This is again a technical section and the\ngeneral reader may wish to skip these sections. In Section 4\nwe describe how we model the galaxy k+e corrections. In\nSection 5 we briefly describe a set of mock catalogues, which\nwe use both to test our implementation of the luminosity\nfunction estimators and to assess the effects of large-scale\nstructure. We present a series of luminosity function esti-\nmates in Section 6, where we compare results for different\nregions and subsets of the survey. In Section 7 we examine\nthe 2dFGRS number counts that we use to normalize our\nLF estimates and compare them to counts from the SDSS.\nOur normalized estimate of the 2dFGRS luminosity func-\ntion is presented in Section 8. We compare our results with\nindependent LF estimates in Section 9. In Section 10 we use\nour best estimate of the 2dFGRS LF, together with the de-\nscription of the survey magnitude limits and completeness,\nto construct a model of the survey selection function. From\nthis we extract the expected redshift distribution which we\ncompare with those of the real survey and mock catalogues.\nWe discuss our results and present our conclusions in Sec-\ntion 11.\n2 THE 2dF GALAXY REDSHIFT SURVEY\nThe 2dFGRS is selected in the photographic bJ band from\nthe APM galaxy survey (Maddox et al. 1990b, 1990c, 1996)\nand subsequent extensions to cit that include a region in\nthe northern galactic cap (Maddox et al. 2002). The sur-\nvey covers approximately 2151.6 deg2 in two broad decli-\nnation strips. The larger of these is centred on the South\nGalactic Pole (SGP) and approximately covers \u221222\u25e6.5 > \u03b4\n> \u221237\u25e6.5, 21h40m < \u03b1 < 3h40m; the smaller strip is in the\nnorthern galactic cap and covers 2\u25e6.5 > \u03b4 > \u22127\u25e6.5, 9h50m\n< \u03b1 < 14h50m. In addition, there are a number of pseudo-\nrandomly located circular 2-degree fields scattered across\nthe full extent of the low extinction regions of the southern\nAPM galaxy survey. There are some gaps in the 2dFGRS\nsky coverage within these boundaries due to small regions\nthat have been excluded around bright stars and satellite\ntrails. The aim of the 2dFGRS is to measure the redshifts\nof all the galaxies within these boundaries with extinction-\ncorrected bJ magnitudes brighter than 19.45. As described\nin Colless et al. (2001), this is attempted by dividing the\ntarget galaxies among a series of overlapping 2o diameter\nfields. The degree of overlap of the fields is such that the\nnumber of targets assigned to each field is no greater than\nthe 400 fibres that the 2dF instrument uses to obtain spec-\ntra for each target simultaneously. When all these 2o fields\nhave been observed, in early 2002, close to 250 000 galaxy\nredshifts will have been measured.\nIn this paper we use the 153 986 redshifts obtained prior\nto May 2001 in the main NGP and SGP strips. This sample\ncovers a large fraction of the full 2dFGRS area, but as shown\nin Fig. 1, within this area the sampling rate varies with\nposition on the sky. This is a direct consequence of some of\nthe overlapping 2o fields having not yet been observed and\nso is well understood and can be accurately modelled (see\nsection 8 of Colless et al. 2001).\nFor accurate statistical analysis of the 2dFGRS it is\nessential to understand fully the criteria that define its par-\nent photometric galaxy catalogue and also the spatial and\nmagnitude dependent completeness of the redshift survey. In\nthe remainder of this section we describe the calibration and\nphotometric accuracy of the parent galaxy catalogue. The\naccuracy and completeness of the redshift survey have been\nquantified in the survey paper Colless et al. (2001). Later,\nin Section 3, we complement the analysis of Colless et al.\n(2001) and our description of the 2dFGRS photometry by\nmaking a direct comparison with data from the overlapping\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n2dFGRS bJ-band Luminosity Function 3\nFigure 1. The sky coverage of the 2dFGRS dataset analysed in this paper. This dataset includes galaxy redshifts from all fields observed\nbefore May 2001 that have a redshift completeness greater than 70%. As the fields overlap and many are still to be observed, the\ncompleteness varies across the sky. The quantity represented by the grey-scale is the sector redshift completeness, R(\u03b8), defined in\nAppendix A.\nEarly Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS).\nA detailed description of the calibration of the origi-\nnal APM catalogue can be found in Maddox et al. (1990c\nhereafter APMII). Here we start, in \u00a72.1, by reviewing the\nimportant steps in this process, referring the reader to sec-\ntions of APMII where many more details can be found along\nwith various tests of the assumptions made in modelling the\nphotometry. In \u00a72.2, we describe the additional calibrating\ndata and dust corrections that were used to define the input\ncatalogue used to select objects for the 2dFGRS (see also\nMaddox et al. 2002). Finally, in \u00a72.3, we describe how re-\ncently available CCD data and revised dust maps have been\nused to define the 2dFGRS magnitudes which were made\npublic in the 100k release and which we adopt throughout\nthis paper.\n2.1 APM Photometric Calibration\nThe APM measures photographic density and for each im-\nage calculates the integrated density and area within an\nisodensity contour. If the images are not saturated, these\nare equivalent to an uncalibrated isophotal magnitude and\ncorresponding isophotal area. These are converted to un-\ncalibrated raw total magnitudes by modelling the intensity\nprofile of each image as a gaussian. It is argued that this is a\nsufficiently accurate assumption as the observed profiles of\nthe fainter galaxies are dominated by gaussian seeing, while\nthe isophotal correction is small for the bright galaxies (AP-\nMII \u00a72.1).\nThe isodensity threshold of the APM images corre-\nsponds roughly to a surface brightness of 25.0mag arcsec\u22122\n(Shao et al. 2002), but varies significantly within each UKST\nfield. The main causes of this variation are geometric vi-\ngnetting (variation of the effective area of the telescope with\noff axis angle) and desensitization of the hyper-sensitized\nphotographic emulsion, which varies both systematically\nand randomly with field position (APMII \u00a72.2). If the in-\ntrinsic sky brightness is uniform across the field of view then\nvariations in the measured sky brightness can be used to es-\ntimate the variation of the sensitivity across the plate. In\nAPMII \u00a72.3, a model is developed to correct the raw total\nmagnitudes using such maps of the measured sky bright-\nness across each plate. This model assumes that the magni-\ntudes being corrected are total magnitudes, that the true sky\nbrightness is uniform across the field of view and that the\nUKST plates are of uniformly high quality. These corrections\ndo not take account of saturation effects which are expected\nto become significant for galaxies brighter than bJ = 16 and\nmay affect fainter high surface brightness ellipticals.\nAfter applying the corrections described above the re-\nsulting field-corrected total magnitudes, mFC, are consis-\ntently defined over an individual UKST plate. However, the\nzeropoint and possibly the non-linearity can vary from plate\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n4 P. Norberg et al.\nto plate. Matched images on the substantial overlaps be-\ntween the plates are used to find a set of transformations\nthat bring the magnitudes on all the plates onto a common\nscale (APMII \u00a73). Linear transformations of the form\nmA = ai + bimFC (1)\nwere adopted to express the matched APM magnitudes, mA\nin terms of the field-corrected magnitudes. Here, for plate i,\nai is the zeropoint offset and bi a term that can correct\nfor residual non-linearity. The degree of non-linearity in the\noriginal APM plates is quite small with an rms variation\n\u3008(bi \u2212 1)2\u30091\/2 = 0.05.\nThis procedure does not constrain the overall zeropoint\nor linearity of the survey. This global calibration was done\nusing a limited number of B and V-band CCD sequences\nthat were spread reasonably uniformly across the survey\narea (APMII \u00a74). Total CCD magnitudes were measured\nand converted into the bJ-band using bJ = B\u2212 0.28(B\u2212V)\n(Blair & Gilmore 1982). Then a calibration curve of the form\nbJ = aglobal + bglobal mA + cglobal m\n2\nA (2)\nwas determined by minimising the residuals between the fi-\nnal APM bJ and CCD total magnitude. A plot of the result-\ning calibration curve (both with and without the quadratic\nterm) is shown in figure 1 of Maddox et al. (1990a). The\nCCD sequences were also used as a check of the zeropoints\ndetermined by plate matching (APMII \u00a74.2).\nIt is important to realize that while the APM magni-\ntudes are based on measurements which are approximately\nequivalent to an isophotal magnitude (with a somewhat un-\ncertain and varying isophote), the APM correction and cali-\nbration procedure converts these into estimates of total mag-\nnitudes. The result should be that for galaxies in each inter-\nval of apparent magnitude the mean calibrated APM mag-\nnitude equals the mean total magnitude of the calibrating\nCCD data. The scatter about this mean relation is approx-\nimately 0.16 magnitudes, this being driven mainly by the\ninaccuracy of photographic photometry, but also it is to be\nexpected that within this scatter the residuals will correlate\nwith surface brightness and possibly other properties of the\ngalaxy images.\n2.2 Calibration of 2dFGRS input catalogue\nIn 1994, when the input catalogue of the 2dFGRS was spec-\nified, substantially more CCD data was available than when\nthe original APM catalogue was calibrated. Also new, im-\nproved plates and\/or APM scans were available for a few\nUKST fields. Consequently both the plate matching and the\nfinal global calibration steps described above were redone us-\ning the new data. This time the parameters bi in equation\n(1) were kept fixed at unity. The reason for this was that in\nthe original APM survey the deviations from linearity were\nquite small; also, for the purposes of selecting the bJ < 19.45\ncatalogue it was not necessary to have accurate bright mag-\nnitudes. The galaxies used in the plate matching were se-\nlected to have magnitudes in the range 19.5 < bJ < 20.5,\nclose to the 2dFGRS magnitude limit.\nThe new CCD data was provided by Jon Loveday &\nSimon Lilly (private communication) and consists of 330\n10\u2032\u00d7 10\u2032 fields in B and R centred on galaxies selected from\nthe Stromlo-APM catalogue (Loveday et al. 1996). The data\nwas taken using the CTIO 1.5m and total magnitudes were\ndetermined using using Sextractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996).\nThe integration times were 2 minutes in R and 5 minutes in\nB, leading to completeness limits of B \u223c 21 and R \u223c 20. This\nyields 13 162 images brighter than bJ = 21. Of these, 1 760\nmatched with galaxies in the APM data and these were used\nto determine the global calibration of APM magnitudes (i.e.\ndetermine the parameters of equation 2). This new calibra-\ntion was slightly different to the original APM calibration,\nboth in terms of linearity correction and zero-point.\nTo accommodate an efficient observing strategy for the\n2dFGRS it was necessary to extend the APM survey. Two\noverlapping strips of UKST plates in the region 9h < \u03b1 <\n15h, \u22127\u25e6.5 < \u03b4 < 3\u25e6.5, close to the NGP, were reduced us-\ning the standard APM galaxy survey procedures. For this\narea significant quantities of calibrating CCD data were not\ndirectly available. However, APM scans of the same UKST\nplates (reduced using a somewhat different suite of software)\nhad been calibrated using CCD data by Raychaudhury et\nal. (1994). We had access to these calibrating catalogues,\nbut not the original CCD data. We, therefore, set our global\ncalibration by minimising the galaxy by galaxy residuals be-\ntween our magnitudes and the calibrated magnitudes given\nby Raychaudhury et al. (1994).\nThe final step in the preparation of the magnitudes used\nto select the 2dFGRS parent catalogue was to apply extinc-\ntion corrections. For this we used a new, high resolution\ndust map supplied to us by David Schlegel, in advance of\nthe slightly modified map that was subsequently published\nin Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis (1998).\n2.3 100k 2dFGRS recalibration\nHere we describe the improvements that were made to the\n2dFGRS calibration and extinction corrections after target\nselection. These improved magnitudes (as well as the original\nmagnitudes on which target selection was based) are avail-\nable in the public 100k Release\u22c6 for the whole of the 2dF-\nGRS parent catalogue. In outline, two main changes were\nmade:\n(i) Corrections for plate-to-plate nonlinearities. The orig-\ninal calibrating CCD photometry concentrated on galax-\nies near bJ \u2243 20, so the linearity of the photometry at\nbright magnitudes was hard to check. More recent CCD\ndata showed that significant nonlinearities were sometimes\npresent. The main tool used to correct these was the mean\noptical to infrared colour on each plate between 2dFGRS\nand the 2MASS survey.\n(ii) Improved estimates of the foreground extinction. The\noriginal 2dFGRS selection, performed in 1994, was based\non magnitudes corrected using a preliminary version of the\nSchlegel et al. (1998) dust map. The final version and cali-\nbration of this map differed slightly from the one originally\nadopted. On average, the updated extinction corrections are\nlarger than those initially adopted, by a factor of approxi-\nmately 1.3. This yields rms shifts in zero point of 0.02 mag-\nnitudes in the NGP, and half this in the SGP.\n\u22c6 The data in 100k Release are publically available at\nhttp:\/\/www.mso.anu.edu.au\/2dFGRS\/\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n2dFGRS bJ-band Luminosity Function 5\nFigure 2. Comparison of 2dFGRS photographic bJ magnitudes with CCD magnitudes from EIS Patch B. Panel (a) is a scatter plot of\nthe magnitude difference versus 2dFGRS magnitude and the solid and dotted lines show the magnitude dependence of the median, 16%\nand 84% quantiles of the distribution. The median magnitude difference, \u2206, for all the galaxies in the range 17 < bJ < 19.5 is indicated\non the panel. The distribution of magnitude differences with respect to this median is shown as a histogram in panel (b). The dotted\ncurve, which describes the core of this distribution quite well, is a gaussian with \u03c3 = 0.15 magnitudes. A robust estimate of the width\nof this distribution, \u03c368, defined such that 2\u03c368 spans 68% of the distribution, is also indicated on the panel.\nIn principle, variations in plate-to-plate nonlinearity\nmight not be expected to be a problem. These effects can\nbe diagnosed when the magnitudes in the overlap region\nbetween two different plates are compared. The ideal case\nwould then be a set of plates with a consistent set of magni-\ntudes in the overlaps, whose absolute zero point and degree\nof linearity can be assessed by combining all the calibrating\nCCD photometry. The practical difficulty is that the num-\nber of bright galaxies for comparison in the overlaps can be\nsmall where one of the plates is of lower quality, prevent-\ning an accurate determination of the linearity of that plate.\nThis turns out to have been a significant problem in the\nNGP zone, where we used fewer plates than in the SGP,\nand where the quality was less homogeneous. Nevertheless,\nthere were some nonlinearity problems in the SGP also.\nThe direct measurement of plate nonlinearities requires\nlarge CCD datasets. In the SGP, we were able to make com-\nparison with the results of the public ESO Imaging Sur-\nvey (EIS) in the Patch B region (Prandoni et al. 1999) and\nthe Chandra Deep Field (Arnouts et al. 2001). We also had\naccess to data from the ESO\u2013Sculptor Survey (Arnouts et\nal. 1997). The Patch B dataset is the largest, and showed\nthe 2dFGRS photometry to be consistent with linear in\nthis plate (UKST 411); there was significant nonlinearity\nin the Chandra Deep Field (UKST 418), however. The EIS\ndatasets have accurately determined colour equations, so we\nare able to make an accurate determination of the colour\nequation between bJ and Johnson B & V:\nbJ = B\u2212 (0.267 \u00b1 0.019)(B \u2212 V), (3)\nverifying our standard colour term of 0.28.\nIn the north, the main comparison was with the MGC\nsurvey (Lemon et al. 2002). This covers a 36 deg2 strip be-\ntween 10h < \u03b1 < 15h and overlaps with 15 UKST plates in\nthe 2dFGRS NGP strip (a total of 5205 galaxies in common).\nData are available only in a blue filter (BMGC) that differs\nsomewhat from the 2dFGRS bJ. The MGC thus cannot yield\nan absolute calibration for 2dFGRS, but the accuracy of the\ndata (a limiting magnitude of BMGC \u2243 24) means that pre-\ncise measures of nonlinearity and relative zero-points were\npossible. For each UKST plate, we fitted a linear relation of\nthe form\nBMGC = ai + bibJ, (4)\nwhere bJ is the observed 2dFGRS magnitude, prior to dust\ncorrection. In this way we determined the non-linearity bi\nand relative zeropoint ai of each of the 15 UKST plates.\nNonlinearities of up to |bi\u22121| = 0.2 were measured (median\n0.08). That variations in linearity exist in the NGP strip is\nnot surprising. As discussed in APMII \u00a72.3, the model that\nwas constructed to correct the raw APM magnitudes for vi-\ngnetting and variations in plate sensitivity assumes that the\nUKST plates are of uniform quality. In particular, it is as-\nsumed that the sky brightness varies by only a small amount\nboth across the field of view of each plate and from one plate\nto another. This assumption is less valid for the NGP strip,\nas the UKST plates used here were less homogeneous than\nin the original APM survey.\nBased on these results, nonlinearities must also exist\nfor plates where large CCD datasets are lacking. In the ab-\nsence of this information, we resorted to the only uniform\nall-sky source of digital galaxy photometry: the near-infrared\n2-Micron All-Sky Survey (Jarrett et al. 2000). In particu-\nlar, we concentrated on the J-band 2MASS magnitudes for\n2MASS-detected galaxies that are also in the 2dFGRS. Al-\nthough the 2MASS data are at a much longer wavelength\nthan the APM photometry, nevertheless comparing 2MASS\nand APM photometry proved to be very useful. The plate\nmatching procedure used to define the 2dFGRS magnitudes\nshould be accurate at approximately bJ = 20 (the typical\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n6 P. Norberg et al.\nmagnitude of most of the galaxies used in the matching),\nand this is verified by our original calibrating CCD photom-\netry. However, residual non-linearity can result in signifi-\ncant plate-to-plate offsets at bright magnitudes. As the me-\ndian magnitude of the matched 2MASS\u20132dFGRS galaxies is\nbJ \u2243 17.5, such offsets manifest themselves as variations in\nthe median bJ\u2212J of the matched galaxies. For this compar-\nison, we used magnitudes corrected for extinction using the\nmost recent dust maps. Any offset (\u22062MASS) in this median\ncolour over a single UKST plate with respect to the global\naverage should thus indicate an error in the bright 2dFGRS\nmagnitudes, and hence a nonlinearity. We were able to ver-\nify that this assumption worked well by comparison with\nthe 18 plates with direct nonlinearity measurements, and\nwe therefore assumed that measurements of \u22062MASS could\nbe used to diagnose nonlinearities in all plates. In practice,\nrather than assuming that plate overlaps assured an exact\nmatching at some specific magnitude between 20 and 21, an\nempirical approach was taken. The MGC data showed that\nboth nonlinearity and the relative zero-point offsets at 19.45\ncorrelated with \u22062MASS, so a single value for \u22062MASS was\nused to give an estimate for each of these quantities.\nThe practical problem with this strategy is that not all\nplates have an accurate measurement of \u22062MASS. The dis-\npersion in bJ\u2212J is approximately 0.5 magnitudes, so several\nhundred 2MASS galaxies per plate are required to give a suf-\nficiently accurate measurement of the offset. Some plates fail\nto satisfy this criterion, since the full 2MASS survey is not\nyet available. We therefore proceeded as follows. Examin-\ning the trend of \u22062MASS with sky position showed strong\nevidence for an approximately linear variation of \u22062MASS\nwith RA and declination in both NGP and SGP. It is quite\nunderstandable that the plate-matching could allow a slow\ndrift of the magnitude linearity in this way; we therefore\nused a linear fit as the initial estimate of \u22062MASS, and\nhence nonlinearity, in any given plate. Where the measure-\nment of \u22062MASS was significantly different from the position-\ndependent fit, a Bayesian approach was adopted, as follows.\nConsider the deviation of the exact value of \u22062MASS with\nrespect to the fit \u2013 call this dt, and let it have a prior proba-\nbility distribution P (dt). We have an estimate of dt from the\nlimited 2MASS data that actually exist \u2013 call this d2m. We\nare interested in the probability of dt given d2m, for which\nBayes\u2019 theorem says\nP (dt|d2m) \u221d P (dt)P (d2m|dt). (5)\nThis probability can be maximized to give a preferred value\nof dt for a given d2m, taking into account the known sta-\ntistical errors on d2m. An estimate of the prior P (dt) was\nobtained from the plates with very accurate values of d2m\nand\/or those with CCD data. This procedure allows us to\ninterpolate smoothly between accepting \u22062MASS where it is\nwell defined, and using the position-dependent fit where the\n2MASS data are sparse on an individual plate. This yields\na best estimate of \u22062MASS for each plate, and hence an es-\ntimate of the linearity of the initial 2dFGRS photometry on\nthat plate. Of course, direct measurements of nonlinearity\nfrom CCD data are to be preferred where they exist, and\nthe direct results from the MGC and EIS comparisons were\nused to recalibrate the relevant plates, without reference to\nthe 2MASS results.\nThus for the magnitudes given in the 100k release the\nuse of 2MASS and MGC data has augmented the matching\nof plates that was done using the overlaps. In the SGP the\ncorrections to the magnitudes are modest. The rms variation\nin linearity is \u3008(b\u2212 1)2\u30091\/2 = 0.034 and the rms shift of the\nzeropoint at bJ = 19.45 is 0.043 magnitudes. In the NGP,\nwhich was constructed from a less homogeneous set of UKST\nplates, the changes are much more significant: the rms vari-\nation in linearity is \u3008(b \u2212 1)2\u30091\/2 = 0.106 and the induced\nrms shift of the zeropoint at bJ = 19.45 is 0.123 magnitudes.\nAfter applying these nonlinear transformations, the cor-\nrected magnitudes should now be on a consistent scale on all\nplates in both SGP and NGP. The overall zeropoint will still\nbe that set at the faint end by our initial CCD calibration.\nAs an external absolute check of the zeropoint, we compared\nwith the optical CCD data from the EIS Patch B (Prandoni\net al. 1999), the EIS Chandra Deep Field (Arnouts et al.\n2001), and the ESO-Sculptor survey (Arnouts et al. 1997),\nsince these are the largest datasets, and have the best char-\nacterized colour equations. The mean offset of these three\nfields with respect to the original APM magnitudes was\n0.03 magnitudes, in the sense that the original magnitudes\nwere too faint. This shift was applied, placing our magni-\ntudes on average on the same zeropoint as the EIS. The\nstandard deviation of the three offsets was 0.035 magnitudes,\nwhich is in fact smaller than the 0.07 plate-to-plate disper-\nsion that we would expect over a large sample. Therefore,\nit is conservative to assume that the rms uncertainty in the\n2dFGRS overall zeropoint is 0.07\/\n\u221a\n3 = 0.04 magnitudes,\nassuming no error in EIS. The internal tests of Prandoni\net al. (1999) suggest that any systematic errors in the EIS\ncalibration are smaller than this figure. The EIS and cali-\nbrated 2dFGRS magnitudes are compared in Fig. 2. The rms\nerror in an individual galaxy magnitude is approximately\n0.15. The effect of these recalibrations, and the change in\nthe dust correction, is shown in figures 13 and 14 of Colless\net al. (2001).\n3 COMPARISON WITH THE SDSS\nHere we complement the description given above and in the\nsurvey construction papers (Colless et al. 2001; Maddox et\nal. 2002) by making a direct comparison of the 2dFGRS\ncatalogue with the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS). The two datasets have approx-\nimately 30 000 galaxies in common of which about 10 000\nhave redshift measurements in both surveys. Here we use\nthese data to assess the accuracy of the 2dFGRS photom-\netry, the completeness of the parent galaxy catalogue and\nthe accuracy and reliability of the redshifts.\n3.1 Photometric Accuracy\nThe 2dFGRS magnitudes that we use here are the same\nas those made public in our June 2001 100k Release. As\ndescribed in \u00a72, they are pseudo-total magnitudes mea-\nsured from APM scans of photographic plates from the UK\nSchmidt Telescope (UKST) Southern Sky Survey and their\nprecision depends on the accuracy of the zeropoint, and non-\nlinearity corrections of each plate, as well as the measure-\nment errors within each plate. The overlap of SDSS and\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n2dFGRS bJ-band Luminosity Function 7\n2dFGRS is in the NGP where our calibration corrections\nwere largest and so the comparison provides a strong test of\nthese calibrations. Note that in the comparisons made in this\nsection we apply extinction corrections to both the 2dFGRS\nand SDSS data based on the extinction map of Schlegel et\nal. (1998).\nThe panels of Fig. 3 compare 2dFGRS magnitudes with\nPetrosian CCD magnitudes from the SDSS EDR (Stoughton\net al. 2002). The definition of the SDSS Petrosian mag-\nnitudes is described in Blanton et al. (2001), which also\ndemonstrates they are essentially equivalent to total magni-\ntudes for disk galaxies while underestimating the luminosity\nof spheroids by approximately 0.15 magnitudes. This is very\nsimilar to the behaviour of the total magnitudes derived us-\ning Sextractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996), which were used in\nthe APM and 2dF calibration. We note that for the purposes\nof calibration the less robust SDSS model magnitudes (the\ndefault magnitudes in the SDSS database) are not suitable.\nHere we have estimated bJ from the SDSS photometry\n\u2020 us-\ning the transformation\nbJ = g + 0.155 + 0.152 (g\u2212 r). (6)\nThis relation comes from adopting the colour equations\ngiven for B and V in Fukugita et al. (1996) and combining\nthese with bJ = B\u22120.28(B\u2212V ) (Blair & Gilmore 1982), as\nverified by the EIS data. Fig. 3d is an empirical test of the\ncolour term in our adopted transformation. The very weak\ndependence of the median magnitude difference on colour is\nconsistent with the 0.152(g \u2212 r) colour term. A simple least\nsquares fit gives a coefficient 0.152\u00b10.004 and so is strongly\ninconsistent with the colour term of 0.088(g \u2212 r) that was\nadopted by Blanton et al. (2001) in the comparison between\nthe SDSS and the 2dFGRS luminosity function (Folkes et\nal. 1999).\nFig. 3a shows that, in the range 17 < bJ < 19.5, the re-\nlation between 2dFGRS and SDSS Petrosian magnitudes is\nclose to linear and that the scatter between the two mea-\nsurements is only weakly dependent on apparent magni-\ntude, being slightly greater at brighter magnitudes. There\nis evidence for a very weak departure from linearity with\n\u2206bJ\nSDSS \u2248 0.94\u2206bJ2dF for bJ < 18, but at fainter magni-\ntudes, where the vast majority of 2dFGRS galaxies lie, the\nrelation is accurately linear. There is a zeropoint offset, with\nthe median 2dFGRS magnitude being fainter than that of\nthe SDSS by |\u2206| = 0.058 magnitudes. This is not surpris-\ning as the zeropoint in the SDSS EDR data is only claimed\nto be accurate to \u00b10.03 magnitudes (Blanton et al. 2001)\nand similarly we estimate the accuracy of the 2dFGRS zero-\npoint to be \u00b10.04 magnitudes (see Section 2.3). The SDSS\nEDR data span 15 UKST plates in the NGP region of the\n2dFGRS and there is some plate-to-plate variation in the\nmedian offset between 2dFGRS and SDSS Petrosian magni-\ntudes. We find an rms variation of 0.083 magnitudes which\nis in reasonable agreement with the 0.07 magnitudes rms we\nestimated from the calibrating photometry, and adds little\nto the measurement error in an individual galaxy magnitude.\n\u2020 The calibration of the magnitudes in SDSS EDR is preliminary.\nIn many of the SDSS papers a superscript asterix (e.g. g\u2217 \u2212 r\u2217 )\nis used to distinguish these magnitudes from those that the SDSS\nwill ultimately provide.\nWe expect the variation in plate zeropoints to be somewhat\nless in the SGP region of the 2dFGRS as this region was\nconstructed from a more homogeneous set of high quality\nUKST plates than is available in the NGP. At present there\nare not enough public CCD data to verify this claim. In the\nother panels of Fig. 3 the median offset between 2dFGRS\nand SDSS magnitudes on each plate has been subtracted\nfrom the magnitude differences.\nFigs. 3b and c show, for the subset of galaxies for which\nredshifts have been measured, the magnitude difference as\na function of absolute magnitude and redshift. Fig. 3b in-\ndicates that the median offset between 2dFGRS and SDSS\nmagnitudes is, to a good approximation, independent of ab-\nsolute magnitude. In Fig. 3c below z \u2248 0.16 there is very lit-\ntle variation in the median magnitude difference. At higher\nredshift there is a weak trend with the 2dFGRS bJ-band\nmagnitude becoming systematically brighter than that in-\nferred from the SDSS. We note that, in contrast, the isopho-\ntal magnitudes used by Blanton et al. (2001) in attempting\nto reproduce the 2dFGRS LF of Folkes et al. (1999), which\nthey argued were a good approximation of APM magni-\ntudes, falsely predicted that the 2dFGRS magnitude would\nmonotonically become fainter than the SDSS magnitude\nwith increasing redshift. The main reason for the inaccu-\nracy of the Blanton et al. (2001) model is that it neglected\nto take account of the way in which APM and 2dFGRS\nmagnitudes are calibrated. We recall that the calibration of\nthe raw APM magnitudes involves both a zeropoint and a\nnon-linearity correction so that, in principle, for galaxies in\neach interval of apparent magnitude the median calibrated\n2dFGRS magnitude equals the median total magnitude of\nthe calibrating CCD data (Maddox et al. 1990c). The weak\nvariation with redshift seen in Fig. 3c is, in fact, probably\ndue to systematic variation with redshift of the relationship\nbetween g, r and bJ magnitudes. The colour equation we\nhave adopted is empirically verified to be accurate for the\nbulk of the 2dFGRS galaxies, which have a median redshift\nof z \u2248 0.1. At higher redshift, as different rest frame spec-\ntral features pass through the three filter bands, one expects\nsmall changes in the colour equation.\nIn Fig. 3e we see that there is a significant correlation\nbetween the SDSS-2dFGRS magnitude residual and surface\nbrightness. The 2dFGRS magnitudes of galaxies with sur-\nface brightnesses of \u00b5bJ \u2248 23 mag arcsec\u22122 are correct in\nthe mean, but the magnitudes of higher surface brightness\ngalaxies become progressively too faint. A similar correla-\ntion is also found by Cross et al. (2002b) when comparing\n2dFGRS and MGC photometry. Such a correlation is to be\nexpected due to saturation of the UKST plates (Metcalfe,\nFong & Shanks 1995). This variation of measured magni-\ntude with surface brightness does contribute significantly to\nthe overall 2dFGRS magnitude measurement error. The dis-\ntribution shown by the dashed curve in Fig. 3f shows that\ncorrecting for the variation with surface brightness would\nreduce the width of the error distribution from \u03c368 = 0.164\nto \u03c368 = 0.118 magnitudes. However, for the full 2dFGRS\ndataset this cannot be done as there is not yet a sufficiently\naccurate measure of surface brightness (but see Shao et al.\n2002). The surface brightness correlation makes negligible\ndifference to the overall luminosity function and 2dFGRS\nselection function. Here all one needs is an accurate model of\nthe overall distribution of the 2dFGRS magnitude measure-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n8 P. Norberg et al.\nFigure 3.

The following four panels show the SDSS-2dFGRS magnitude differences versus (b) absolute magnitude, (c)\nredshift, (d) g\u2212 r colour and (e) surface brightness. The surface brightness is the SDSS measurement of mean surface brightness within\nthe Petrosian half light radius converted into the bJ band. In all these panels we again show the 16%, 50% and 84% quantiles of the\ndistribution. In all but panel (a), the residual is calculated after subtracting the median offset from each UKST plate. The distribution\nof magnitude differences with respect to the median is shown as a histogram in panel (f). The dotted curve, which describes the core of\nthis distribution quite well, is a gaussian with \u03c3 = 0.15 magnitudes. A robust estimate of the width of this distribution is \u03c368 = 0.164,\nwhere \u00b1\u03c368 spans 68% of the distribution. The empirical model we adopt to describe the full 2dFGRS magnitude measurement errors\nis shown by the smooth solid curve in panel (f) (see text for details). The dashed curve in (f), which has \u03c368 = 0.118, is the distribution\nof residual magnitude difference relative to the mean correlation of residual with surface brightness shown in panel (e).\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n2dFGRS bJ-band Luminosity Function 9\nment errors. However if the luminosity function is derived for\nsubsamples split by spectral type (or another parameter that\ncorrelates with surface brightness) small corrections have to\nbe made (Madgwick et al. 2002).\nThe histogram in Fig. 3f shows the distribution of\nSDSS-2dFGRS magnitude differences. The dotted curve\nwhich describes the core of the distribution quite well is\na gaussian with \u03c3 = 0.15. The tail, in excess of this gaus-\nsian, of objects for which the 2dFGRS measures a fainter\nmagnitude than the SDSS is very small. There is a some-\nwhat larger tail of objects for which the 2dFGRS measures\na brighter magnitude than the SDSS. It is most likely that\nthese objects are close pairs of images which the SDSS has\nresolved, but which are merged into a single object in the\n2dFGRS catalogue. This is precisely what is found for the\n2dFGRS when compared to the MGC catalogue (Lemon et\nal. 2002) by Cross et al. (2002b). The overall distribution\nof magnitude differences is well fitted by the model shown\nby the solid curve. This model is the sum of a gaussian\nand a log-normal distribution. The gaussian component has\n\u03c3 = 0.14 and accounts for 70% of the probability and the re-\nmaining 30% is distributed as a gaussian in ln(1+\u2206bJ) with\n\u03c3 = 0.235. We adopt this model as an empirical description\nof the distribution of the 2dFGRS magnitude measurement\nerrors. In so doing, we are assuming that the random mea-\nsurement errors in the SDSS CCD Petrosian magnitudes do\nnot contribute significantly to the width of this distribution.\nThis assumption is consistent with the comparison of the\nSDSS photometry with the deeper MGC CCD photometry\nin Cross et al. (2002b).\n3.2 Completeness of the 2dF Parent Catalogue\nIn constructing the parent catalogue of the 2dFGRS the\nsame parameters and thresholds were used to perform star-\ngalaxy separation as in the original APM galaxy survey\n(Maddox et al. 1990b). Thus, the expectation is that the\nparent galaxy catalogue will be 90-95% complete and con-\ntamination from stellar objects will be 5-10% (Maddox et\nal. 1990b). In fact, the spectroscopic identification of the\n2dFGRS objects shows that the stellar contamination is\n5.4% overall and only very weakly dependent on apparent\nmagnitude (see Fig. 4). The SDSS EDR allows us to make\na useful test of the 2dFGRS galaxy completeness. In the\nSDSS commissioning data the star-galaxy classification pro-\ncedure is expected to be better than 99% complete and have\nless than 1% stellar contamination (Blanton et al. 2001). In\nFig. 4 we assess the completeness of the 2dFGRS parent cat-\nalogue both against the SDSS photometric galaxy catalogue\nand against the SDSS sample of spectroscopically confirmed\ngalaxies.\nTo compare to the SDSS spectroscopic sample we se-\nlected the 13 290 SDSS objects that are spectroscopically\nconfirmed as galaxies and have magnitudes brighter than\nbJ = 19.5. For the SDSS photometric galaxy catalogue we\nused the 16 371 objects brighter than bJ = 19.5 that are\nflagged in the EDR database as being members of the SDSS\nmain galaxy survey. The solid (dotted) histogram in the up-\nper panel of Fig. 4 shows, as a function of apparent magni-\ntude, the percentage of the photometrically classified (spec-\ntroscopically confirmed) galaxies that have counterparts in\nthe 2dFGRS. The completeness estimates vary very little\nFigure 4. In the upper panel the solid histogram shows, as a\nfunction of apparent magnitude, the percentage of photometri-\ncally classified galaxies in the SDSS EDR that have 2dFGRS\ncounterparts. This estimate of the completeness should be ig-\nnored rightwards of the vertical dashed line at bJ = 19.0. Fainter\nthan this galaxies are absent from the 2dFGRS catalogue simply\ndue to the faint magnitude limit of the catalogue which varies\nfrom 19.2 < bJ < 19.5. The horizontal line indicates our adopted\n91% completeness. The dotted histogram shows the percentage\nof spectroscopically confirmed SDSS galaxies that have 2dFGRS\ncounterparts. The dashed histogram shows the percentage of ob-\njects in the 2dFGRS parent catalogue in the same area that are\nspectroscopically identified as stars. The lower panel shows the\ncompleteness as a function of the mean galaxy surface bright-\nness within the Petrosian half light radius. In this estimate only\ngalaxies in the magnitude range 17.0 < bJ < 19.0 are considered.\nAgain we show estimates relative to the SDSS parent photometric\ncatalogue (solid histogram) and the spectroscopically confirmed\ngalaxies (dotted histogram). The solid curve shows, on an arbi-\ntrary scale, the distribution of surface brightnesses for the 11 171\ngalaxies in the SDSS sample in this same magnitude range.\nwith magnitude over the entire range 16 < bJ < 19.0. The\ndip evident in the faintest bins is an artifact. Because of\nrandom measurement errors in the APM\/2dFGRS magni-\ntudes and because the magnitude limit in some parts of\nthe NGP strip is as bright as bJ \u2248 19.2 (see Colless et al.\n2001 figures 13 and 14), some of the selected SDSS galaxies\nhave APM magnitudes that are too faint to be included in\nthe 2dFGRS parent catalogue. Over the magnitude range\n17.0 < bJ < 19.0 the completeness relative to SDSS pho-\ntometric galaxy catalogue is between 88.5% and 92%, while\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n10 P. Norberg et al.\nthe completeness measured relative to the spectroscopically\nconfirmed SDSS galaxy catalogue is slightly higher at 91%\nto 95%.\nThe lower panel of Fig. 4 shows the completeness as a\nfunction of the mean galaxy surface brightness within the\nPetrosian half light radius. The surface brightness is esti-\nmated from the extinction-corrected SDSS g and r band\ndata and expressed in the bJ band using the relation given\nin equation (6). In this estimate only galaxies in the mag-\nnitude range 17.0 < bJ < 19.0 are considered. Also shown\nin this figure is the surface brightness distribution for galax-\nies in this magnitude range. At both extremes of surface\nbrightness the completeness of the 2dFGRS galaxy cat-\nalogue diminishes. At the faint end this is because the\ngalaxies become to faint to reliably detect, while at the\nbright end a fraction are mis-classified as stars. However\nover most of surface brightness range populated by galax-\nies the completeness of the 2dFGRS is uniformly high. Rel-\native to the SDSS catalogue of photometrically classified\ngalaxies the completeness has a broad peak of 93.4% for\n21.8 < \u00b5bJ < 23.2, while averaged over the complete galaxy\nsurface brightness distribution the completeness is 90.9%.\nThus, while the incompleteness of the 2dFGRS catalogue\nis approximately 9%, only 2.5% incompleteness is depen-\ndent on the galaxy surface brightness, with only one third\nof this coming from losses at the low surface brightness end.\nThe dominant reason for the approximately 9% incomplete-\nness in the 2dFGRS galaxy catalogue appears to be due to\nmis-classification of images. This conclusion has also been\nreached more directly by Pimbblet et al. (2001), and Cross\net al. (2002b) by comparing the 2dFGRS parent catalogue\nwith deeper wide-area CCD photometry. See also Caretta\net al. (1993), but note the APM catalogue they analyzed\nwas APMCAT (http:\/\/www.ast.cam.ac.uk\/\u02dc apmcat; Irwin\net al. 1994; Lewis & Irwin 1996) which although based on the\nsame scan data as the Maddox et al. (1990b) APM galaxy\ncatalogue has a different algorithm for star-galaxy classifica-\ntion and less reliable galaxy photometry. They have shown\nthat while the 2dFGRS misses some low surface brightness\ngalaxies more are lost due to mis-classification, particularly\nof close galaxy and galaxy-star pairs.\nThe mis-classification of some close galaxy pairs could\nalso explain the slight difference we have found between the\ncompleteness measured relative to the SDSS spectroscopi-\ncally confirmed and photometrically classified galaxy cata-\nlogues. Assuming the SDSS spectroscopic sample is a ran-\ndom sample of the photometric sample, then apart from\nthe effect of the very small fraction (<1%) of photometri-\ncally classified galaxies which turn out to be stars or arti-\nfacts of some kind, we would expect the two estimates of\nincompleteness to agree. However, the spectroscopic sample\nis not a random sample as close pairs of galaxies are under-\nrepresented because of the mechanical limits on how close\nthe optical fibres that feed the spectrograph can be placed.\nThis is a plausible explanation of the difference between the\ntwo completeness estimates. We therefore adopt 91\u00b1 2% as\nthe 2dFGRS galaxy completeness, consistent with the esti-\nmate from the SDSS photometric catalogue. This value is\nindicated by the horizontal line in the upper panel of Fig. 4.\nFigure 5. A histogram of the 2dFGRS-SDSS redshift differences\nfor a sample of 10 763 galaxies for which both surveys have mea-\nsured redshifts with z > 0.003. The smooth curve is a gaussian\nwith \u03c3 = 85.0 km s\u22121.\n3.3 Accuracy and Reliability of Redshift\nMeasurements\nThe 2dFGRS redshift measurements are all assigned a qual-\nity flag Q (Colless et al. 2001). For most purposes only Q \u2265 3\nredshifts are used. From a comparison of repeat observa-\ntions, Colless et al. (2001) estimated that these have a relia-\nbility (defined as the percentage of galaxies whose redshifts\nare within a 600 km s\u22121 tolerance) of 98.4% and an rms ac-\ncuracy of 85 kms\u22121. For higher quality spectra, Q \u2265 4, these\nfigures improve to > 99% and less than 60 km s\u22121, respec-\ntively. Comparison of the 2dFGRS redshifts with the 10 763\ngalaxies which also have redshift measurements in the SDSS\nEDR provides a useful check of these numbers. The frac-\ntion of objects for which the redshifts differ by more than\n600 kms\u22121 is only 1.0% and this presumably includes some\ncases where it is the SDSS redshift that is in error. The red-\nshift differences for the remainder are shown in Fig. 5. This\ndistribution has a width of \u03c368 = 85.0 km s\n\u22121 (defined so\nthat 2\u03c368 spans 68% of the distribution). Taking account of\nthe contribution from the rms error in the SDSS measure-\nments this implies a smaller redshift error than the estimate\nof Colless et al. (2001). Part of the reason for the difference\nin these figures is that the SDSS galaxies are on average\nbrighter than typical 2dFGRS galaxies. Also we have only\ncompared measurements when both the SDSS and 2dFGRS\nredshifts are greater than 0.003. This excludes a small num-\nber of 2dFGRS redshifts that are very small due either to\ncontamination of the spectra by moonlight or light from a\nnearby star. If we further reduce the sample to 10 022 (or\n8 059) objects by excluding objects whose SDSS and 2dF-\nGRS positions differ by more than 1 (or 0.5) arc second\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n2dFGRS bJ-band Luminosity Function 11\nFigure 6. Galaxy g \u2212 r colours as a function of redshift. The\nsymbols and error bars show, for each 2dFGRS spectral type, the\nmedian, 10 and 90 centiles of the g \u2212 r colour distribution, as\na function of redshift. The curves are the predictions for model\ngalaxies, computed using the Bruzual & Charlot stellar popu-\nlation synthesis code, whose star formation histories have been\nselected to reproduce, as closely as possible, the median colour as\na function of redshift in each class.\nthen the reliability increases slightly to 99.14 (or 99.22%).\nThis could indicate that some of the discrepant redshifts\narise from very close galaxy pairs that are unresolved in the\n2dFGRS parent catalogue.\n4 k+e CORRECTIONS\nThe final ingredient that is required to characterise the se-\nlection function of the 2dFGRS is a model describing the\nchange in galaxy magnitude due to redshifting of the galaxy\nspectra relative to the bJ-filter bandpass (k-correction) and\ngalaxy evolution (e-correction). These corrections depend on\nthe galaxy\u2019s spectrum and star formation history. As these\nare correlated, one can parameterize the k+e corrections as\nfunctions of the observed spectra.\nA subset of 2dFGRS spectra have been classified using\na method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\nA continuous parameter, \u03b7, is defined as a linear combina-\ntion of the first two principal components (Madgwick et al.\n2002). The definition of \u03b7 is such that its value correlates\nwith the strength of absorption\/emission features. Galaxies\nwith old stellar populations and strong absorption features\nhave negative values of \u03b7, while galaxies with young stellar\npopulations and strong emission lines have positive values.\nTherefore, we expect the value of \u03b7 to correlate with the\ngalaxy\u2019s k and k+e correction. In Madgwick et al. (2002),\nthe continuous \u03b7 distribution was divided into four galaxy\nclasses (Type 1: \u03b7 < \u22121.4, Type 2: \u22121.4 \u2264 \u03b7 < 1.1, Type 3:\n1.1 \u2264 \u03b7 < 3.5, Type 4: 3.5 \u2264 \u03b7) and the mean k-correction\nfor each type was estimated from the mean spectra of galax-\nies in each class. A current weakness of this approach is that\nthe overall system response of the 2dF instrument is not\nwell calibrated. This implies that the resulting k-corrections\nFigure 7.Model k and k+e corrections for each 2dFGRS spectral\ntype. The symbols in the top panel show the k-corrections for four\nmodels selected to match the g\u2212r colours as a function of redshift\nplotted in Fig. 6. The curves show the corresponding k-corrections\nadopted in Madgwick et al. (2002). The symbols in the lower panel\nshow our model k+e corrections. In this case, the smooth curves\nare simple analytic fits [Type 1 : k+ e = (2z+2.8z2)\/(1+3.8z3),\nType 2: k+ e = (0.6z+2.8z2)\/(1+ 19.6z3), Type 3: k+ e = (z+\n3.6z2)\/(1 + 16.6z3), Type 4: k+ e = (1.6z+3.2z2)\/(1 + 14.6z3)].\nhave a systematic uncertainty of around 10% (Madgwick et\nal. 2002). Due to this problem and also because we wish to\nestimate k+e corrections and not just k-corrections, we have\ntaken a complementary approach.\nThe spectrum of any individual galaxy will evolve with\ntime as its star formation rate changes and its stellar pop-\nulation evolves. Consequently, the spectral type of such a\ngalaxy could vary with cosmic time. Therefore, if we want to\ngroup the observed galaxies into discrete classes so that the\nevolution of each class can be described by a single model,\nwe should bin the galaxies in both \u03b7 and z. Instead, we will\nbin the galaxies only in \u03b7 and so not explicitly take account\nof galaxies which evolve from one spectral class to another.\nWe do this as adopting a more complicated model makes\nlittle difference to our results and also it enables us to com-\npare our k-corrections directly with those used in Madgwick\net al. (2002).\nIn Fig. 6, we plot the median observed g\u2212r colour mea-\nsured from the SDSS EDR data as a function of redshift for\neach spectral class determined from the 2dFGRS spectra. As\nexpected, we see that galaxy colour and its dependence on\nredshift correlates with the spectral class. Type 1 galaxies,\nwith the most negative value of \u03b7 and oldest stellar popula-\ntions, are reddest and Type 4 are bluest. The curves plotted\non Fig. 6 are models constructed using the Bruzual & Char-\nlot (1993; in preparation, see also Liu, Charlot & Graham\n1993 and Charlot & Longhetti 2001) stellar population syn-\nthesis code. In a manner very similar to that described by\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n12 P. Norberg et al.\nCole et al. (2001), we ran a grid of models each with the\nsame fixed metallicity (Z = Z\u2299\/2) and with a star forma-\ntion history of the form \u03c8(t) \u221d exp(\u2212[t(z)\u2212 t(zf)]\/\u03c4 ), with\na set of different timescales, \u03c4 . Here, t(z) is the age of the\nuniverse at redshift z and the galaxy is assumed to start\nforming stars at zf = 20. To relate redshift to time, we have\nassumed a cosmological model with \u21260 = 0.3, \u039b0 = 0.7 and\nHubble constant H0 = 70 kms\n\u22121 Mpc\u22121. The k and k+e\ncorrections that we derive are only very weakly dependent\non these choices.\nThe models plotted Fig. 6 are the four which best re-\nproduce the observed dependence of the g \u2212 r colours with\nredshift for the four spectral types. They have \u03c4 = 1, 5, 15\nand 1000 Gyr for Type 1,2,3 and 4 respectively. The models\nprovide a complete description of the galaxy spectral en-\nergy distribution and its evolution and so can be used to\ndefine k or k+e corrections for each spectral type. These are\nshown by the symbols in Fig. 7. The Madgwick et al. (2002)\nk-corrections, shown by the curves in the top panel, are sim-\nilar but systematically smaller than those we have derived.\nThis systematic difference is comparable to the systematic\ndifference expected given the current uncertainty in the cal-\nibration of the 2dF instrument, upon which the Madgwick\net al. (2002) k-corrections rely. The bottom panel of Fig. 7\nshows our k+e corrections. Simple analytic fits to the k+e\ncorrection for each spectral class are given in the figure cap-\ntion and shown by the smooth curves. Note that the ordering\nof the k and k+e corrections is not the same. This is because\nthere are competing effects that contribute to the evolution-\nary correction. As the redshift increases, the age of the stel-\nlar population viewed decreases. This effect makes galaxies\nbrighter with increasing redshift, since younger stellar pop-\nulations have smaller mass-to-light ratios, and also changes\nthe shape of the galaxy spectrum. However, there are fewer\nstars present at earlier times and this tends to produce a\ndecrease in luminosity with redshift. For galaxies with on-\ngoing star formation (Types 2,3 and 4) these effects can all\nbe significant in determining the overall k+e correction.\nIt is not possible to assign values of \u03b7 to all the galaxies\nin the 2dFGRS. In fact, only galaxies with z < 0.2 are classi-\nfied in this way and approximately 5% of these have spectra\nwith insufficient signal-to-noise to define \u03b7. Thus, for some\npurposes it is necessary to adopt a mean k or k+e correction\nthat can be applied to all galaxies in the survey. In Fig. 8 we\nshow k and k+e corrections averaged over the varying mix\nof galaxies at each redshift and give simple fitting formulae.\nWe recall that our estimate of the evolutionary correction\nassumes a cosmological model with \u21260 = 0.3, \u039b0 = 0.7 and\nH0 = 70km s\n\u22121 Mpc\u22121 in order to relate redshift and look\nback time. When estimating the galaxy luminosity function\nfor cosmological models with different parameters we retain\nthe same k+e corrections rather than recomputing the best\nfitting Bruzual & Charlot model. While not being entirely\nconsistent, in practice this makes very little difference to our\nluminosity function estimates. In section 8.1, we constrain\nthe uncertainty in k+e correction by comparing luminosity\nfunctions estimated in different redshift bins. This enables\nus to assess the contribution to the error in the luminos-\nity function estimates arising from uncertainties in the k+e\ncorrections.\nFigure 8. The curves show the fits, k(z) = (2.2z + 6z2)\/(1 +\n15z3) and k(z) + e(z) = (z +6z2)\/(1 + 20z3), to the mean k and\nk+e correction as a function of redshift. The mean corrections\nat each redshift, shown by the symbols, have been computed as\na function of redshift from the known fractions of each spectral\ntype. The error bars show the rms scatter about the mean of these\ndistributions.\n5 MOCK AND RANDOM CATALOGUES\nOne of the main purposes of deriving a quantitative descrip-\ntion of the survey selection function is to make it possi-\nble to construct random (unclustered) and mock (clustered)\ngalaxy catalogues. The random catalogues provide a very\nflexible description of the selection function and are most\noften employed when making estimates of galaxy cluster-\ning. The mock catalogues, where the galaxy positions are\ndetermined from cosmological N-body simulations, are even\nmore useful. The underlying galaxy clustering and galaxy\nluminosity function are known for the mock catalogues and\nso these catalogues can be instrumental in testing and devel-\noping codes to estimate these quantities. They also provide\na means for assessing the statistical errors due to realistic\nlarge scale structure on quantities estimated from the actual\nredshift survey. Finally, mock catalogues based on different\ncosmological assumptions provide a direct way to compare\nclustering statistics for the survey with theoretical predic-\ntions. Here, we briefly describe the steps involved in pro-\nducing the mock catalogues that we use below in sections 7\nand 10 and that have been employed earlier in other 2dF-\nGRS analysis papers such as Percival et al. (2001), Norberg\net al. (2001a; 2002). These have been created from the very\nlarge \u201cHubble Volume\u201d simulations carried out by the Virgo\nconsortium (Evrard 1999; Evrard et al. 2002). For more de-\ntails of the construction of the mock catalogues than are\ngiven below see Baugh et al. (2002).\nThe approach we have taken for generating mock and\nrandom catalogues that match the selection and sampling\nof the 2dFGRS can be broken into two stages. In the first\nstage, we generate idealized mock catalogues, which have a\nuniform magnitude limit (somewhat fainter than that of the\ntrue survey) and have no errors in the redshift or magnitude\nmeasurements. In the second stage, we have the option of\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n2dFGRS bJ-band Luminosity Function 13\nintroducing redshift and magnitude measurement errors and\nwe sample the catalogue to reproduce the slightly varying\nmagnitude limit and the dependence of the completeness of\nthe redshift catalogue upon position and apparent magni-\ntude seen in the real 2dFGRS. The steps involved in these\ntwo stages are outlined below. In practice, in order to have\na fast and efficient algorithm, some steps are combined, but\nthe result is entirely equivalent to this simplified description.\n(i) The first step in generating a mock catalogue consists\nof sampling the mass distribution in the N-body simulation\nso as to produce a galaxy catalogue with the required clus-\ntering. We do this by applying one of the simple, ad hoc,\nbiasing schemes described by Cole et al. (1998). We use\ntheir Method 2, but with the final density field smoothed\nwith a gaussian with smoothing length RS = 2h\n\u22121Mpc and\nwith the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 chosen to match the observed\ngalaxy power spectrum. For this we took the galaxy power\nspectrum of the APM survey (Baugh & Efstathiou 1993)\nscaled up in amplitude by 20% to match the amplitude of\nclustering measured in the 2dFGRS at its median redshift.\nThis results in a fractional rms fluctuation in the density of\ngalaxies in spheres of 8h\u22121Mpc of \u03c38 = 0.87.\n(ii) The second step is to choose the location and ori-\nentation of the observer within the simulation. In the mock\ncatalogues used here, this was done by applying certain con-\nstraints so that the local environment of the observer resem-\nbles that of the Local Group (for details see Baugh et al.\n2002).\n(iii) We then adopt a Schechter function with M\u22c6bJ \u2212\n5log10 h = \u221219.66, \u03b1 = \u22121.21 and \u03a6\u22c6 = 1.61 \u00d7\n10\u22122h3Mpc\u22123 as an accurate description of the present day\ngalaxy luminosity function (see Section 8). We combine this\nwith the model of the average k+e correction shown in Fig. 8\nand the adopted faint survey magnitude limit to calculate\nthe expected mean comoving space density of galaxies, n\u00af(z),\nas a function of redshift.\n(iv) We now loop over all the galaxies in the simulation\ncube that fall within the angular boundaries of the survey\nand randomly select or reject them so as to produce the re-\nquired mean n\u00af(z). In the case of random catalogues, we sim-\nply generate randomly positioned points within the bound-\naries of the survey with spatial number density given by\nn\u00af(z).\n(v) For each selected galaxy, we generate an apparent\nmagnitude consistent with its redshift, the assumed lumi-\nnosity function and the faint magnitude limit of the survey.\nTo degrade these ideal mock catalogues to match the\ncurrent completeness and sampling of the 2dFGRS requires\nfour more steps.\n(i) We perturb the galaxy redshifts by drawing random\nvelocities from a gaussian with \u03c3 = 85 kms\u22121 which is the\nvalue estimated in Colless et al. (2001, see also Section 3.3).\n(ii) We perturb the galaxy apparent magnitudes, to ac-\ncount for measurement errors, by drawing random magni-\ntude errors from a distribution that accurately fits the his-\ntogram of SDSS-2dFGRS magnitude differences shown in\nFig. 3f.\n(iii) We make use of the map of the survey magnitude\nlimit as a function of position to throw out galaxies that\nwould be too faint to have been included in the actual 2dF-\nGRS parent catalogue.\n(iv) The final step incorporates the current level of com-\npleteness of the 2dFGRS redshift catalogue. Here, we make\nuse of the maps R(\u03b8) and S(\u03b8,bJ), which quantify the com-\npleteness of the survey. They are defined in Section 8 of\nColless et al. (2001) and summarised in Appendix A. At\neach angular position, \u03b8, only a fraction, R(\u03b8), of the red-\nshifts is retained or, taking account of the slight dependence\nof completeness upon the apparent magnitude, a fraction\nS(\u03b8,bJ), which depends upon apparent magnitude, bJ, as\nwell as position, is instead retained.\n6 THE 2dFGRS LUMINOSITY FUNCTION\nFOR DIFFERENT SUB-SAMPLES\nThe luminosity functions presented here are estimated us-\ning fairly standard implementations of the STY (Sandage,\nTammann & Yahil 1979) and stepwise maximum likelihood\n(SWML Efstathiou, Ellis & Peterson 1988) estimators. The\nonly modifications we have made to the methods described\nin these papers are:\n(i) We use the map, bJ\nlim(\u03b8), of the survey magnitude\nlimit to define the apparent magnitude limit for each indi-\nvidual galaxy.\n(ii) We use the map of \u00b5(\u03b8) to define a weight,\n1\/cz(bJ, \u00b5[\u03b8]), for each galaxy (see equation A3) to com-\npensate for the magnitude dependent incompleteness.\nProvided the most incomplete 2dF fields are excluded from\nthe sample, then the variation in these weights is small.\nSlightly more than 76% of the observed 2dF fields have an\noverall redshift completeness greater than 90%. Here we ex-\nclude the few fields for which the redshift completeness is\nbelow 70%. For this sample the mean weight is 1.06 and the\nrms variation about this is only 0.06. Furthermore, one can\nmake the influence of the weight completely negligible by ap-\nplying an additional magnitude cut and discarding galaxies\nfainter than, for example, bJ = 19.2.\nWe have applied both our STY and SWML LF estima-\ntors to galaxy samples extracted from the mock galaxy cata-\nlogues. In the case of the idealized mock catalogues, not only\ndo the mean estimated luminosity functions agree precisely\nwith the input luminosity function, but also the error esti-\nmates agree well with the scatter between the estimates from\nthe 22 different mock catalogues. For the degraded mocks\nthe estimated luminosity functions reproduce well the input\nluminosity functions convolved with the assumed magnitude\nerrors. It is perhaps also worth noting that we checked that\nthe independently written STY code used in Madgwick et\nal. (2002) gave identical results when applied to the same\nsample and assuming the same k-corrections.\nDue to the large size of the 2dFGRS the statistical er-\nrors in our estimated luminosity functions are extremely\nsmall. It is therefore important to verify that systematic\nerrors are well controlled. This is partially demonstrated in\nFig. 9, where we compare LF estimates for various subsam-\nples of the 2dFGRS.\nFor all the samples shown in Fig. 9 we have applied a\nbright magnitude cut of bJ > 17 and assumed an \u21260 = 0.3,\n\u039b0 = 0.7 cosmology. In addition, we have applied various\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n14 P. Norberg et al.\nFigure 9. Luminosity functions for different subsamples of the 2dFGRS data. The smooth curve in each panel is a Schechter function\nwith M\u22c6bJ\n\u2212 5log10 h = \u221219.67, \u03b1 = \u22121.21 and \u03a6\n\u22c6 = 1.64 \u00d7 10\u22122h3Mpc\u22123. This is the STY estimate for the sample defined by\n17 < bJ < 19.2 and z < 0.25 and computed using the average k+e correction shown in Fig. 8. This curve is reproduced in each panel as\na fiducial reference. In the different panels the points and error bars show SWML LF estimates for different subsets of the 2dFGRS as\nindicated by the selection criteria given in each legend (see text for details). Also indicated on each panel is the number of galaxies in\neach sample. An \u21260 = 0.3, \u039b0 = 0.7 cosmology is assumed and the luminosity functions have been normalized to produce 146 galaxies\nper square degree brighter than bJ = 19.2.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n2dFGRS bJ-band Luminosity Function 15\nextra cuts to define different subsamples.

This is the STY estimate for the sample de-\nfined by 17 < bJ < 19.2 and z < 0.25. In both the STY\nand SWML LF estimates, the normalization of the luminos-\nity function is arbitrary. To aid in the comparisons shown\nin Fig. 9, we have normalized each estimate to produce 146\ngalaxies per square degree brighter than bJ = 19.2 (see Sec-\ntion 7). It can seen by comparison with the SWML estimates\nin each panel that the Schechter function is not a good fit\nat the very bright end. However, it should be borne in mind\nthat in these estimates we have made no attempt to correct\nfor the magnitude measurement errors. Thus, these lumi-\nnosity functions all represent the true luminosity function\nconvolved with the magnitude measurement errors.\nThe influence of the assumed k+e correction is inves-\ntigated in Fig. 9a. The sample used for both the estimates\nin this panel is defined by the limits 17 < bJ < 19.2 and\nz < 0.15 and includes only galaxies which have been as-\nsigned a spectral type. The upper redshift limit is imposed\nto avoid the interval where contamination by sky lines causes\nthe spectral classification to be unreliable (Madgwick et al.\n2002). For one sample, we use the average k+e correction\nshown in Fig. 8, while for the other, we adopt the spectral\nclass dependent k+e corrections of Fig. 7. We see that the\ntwo estimates agree very accurately at all magnitudes. As\nthe systematic difference is so small, we adopt for all other\nestimates the global k+e correction which then allows us to\nuse the full redshift sample. The samples analysed in this\npanel exclude a small fraction (5%) of galaxies whose spec-\ntra have insufficient signal-to-noise to enable spectral clas-\nsification. These are typically low surface brightness, low\nluminosity galaxies. It is for this reason that the luminos-\nity function estimates in this panel fall slightly below the\nestimates in the other panels for magnitudes fainter than\nMbJ \u2212 5log10 h = \u221217.\nFig. 9b shows SWML estimates for samples including\ngalaxies with redshifts up to z = 0.25. The two estimates\ncompare the results for a sample limited by bJ < 19.2 and\nthe sample to the full depth of the 2dFGRS, which has a\nspatially varying magnitude limit of 19.4\u00b10.1 (see figures 13\nand 14 of Colless et al. 2001). The close agreement between\nthe two indicates that no significant bias or error has been\nintroduced by taking account of the varying magnitude limit\nand including the correction for the magnitude dependent\nincompleteness.\nThe remaining panels of Fig. 9 all use samples limited\nby bJ < 19.2, but essentially identical results are found if\nthe samples are extended to the full depth of the survey.\nFig. 9c compares the LF estimates from the spatially sepa-\nrated SGP and NGP regions of the 2dFGRS. Brighter than\nM\u22c6bJ \u2212 5log10 h = \u221217.5, the two regions yield luminosity\nfunctions with identical shapes. Note that both luminosity\nfunctions have been normalized to produce 146 galaxies per\nsquare degree brighter than bJ = 19.2, rather than to the ac-\ntual galaxy number counts in each region. This good agree-\nment suggests that any systematic offset in zeropoint of the\nmagnitude scale in the two disjoint regions is very small.\nIf one allows an offset between the zeropoints of the NGP\nand SGP magnitude scales, then comparing the bright ends\nof these two luminosity functions (MbJ \u2212 5log10 h < \u221217.5)\nconstrains this offset to the rather small value 0.014\u00b1 0.01.\nFainter thanMbJ\u22125log10 h = \u221217.5 the two estimates differ\nsystematically to a small but significant degree. We return\nto this difference briefly in Section 8.1.\nFig. 9d compares results from samples split by redshift.\nHere, the combined effect of the redshift and apparent mag-\nnitude limits results in estimates that only span a limited\nrange in absolute magnitude. To normalize these luminosity\nfunctions we extrapolated the estimates using their corre-\nsponding STY Schechter function estimates. The two lu-\nminosity functions agree well in the overlapping magnitude\nrange and also agree well with the full samples shown in\nthe other panels. This demonstrates that the evolution of\nthe luminosity function is consistent with the k+e-correction\nmodel we have adopted. Since we apply k+e corrections, the\nluminosity function we estimate is always that at z = 0.\nThe final two panels in Fig. 9 examine luminosity func-\ntions estimated from bright subsamples of the 2dFGRS.\nFig. 9e shows an estimate for galaxies brighter than bJ =\n18.5 and Fig. 9f for galaxies brighter than bJ = 18.0. The\nstatistical errors in the estimates from these smaller samples\nare significantly larger. Nevertheless, the luminosity func-\ntions agree well, on average, with those from the deeper\nsamples.\n7 GALAXY NUMBER COUNTS\nIn the previous section we have demonstrated that the\nshape of the 2dF galaxy luminosity function, brighter than\nMbJ \u2212 5log10 h < \u221217, is robust to variations in the sample\nselection and the assumed k+e corrections. We have not yet\naddressed the issue of normalization and its uncertainty; we\nsimply normalized all the estimates to produce 146 galax-\nies per square degree brighter than bJ = 19.2. We now in-\nvestigate the uncertainty in this normalization due to both\nlarge scale structure and the uncertainty in systematic cor-\nrections.\n7.1 The 2dFGRS bJ-band galaxy counts\nThe upper panel in Fig. 10 shows the 2dFGRS galaxy bJ-\nband number counts in the NGP and SGP. In this figure\nwe have subtracted a Euclidean model from the counts to\nenable the ordinate to be expanded so that small differences\nare visible. These are counts of objects in the 2dFGRS par-\nent catalogue (after the removal of the merged images that\ndid not form part of the 2dFGRS target list) multiplied by\na factor of 1\/(1.054 \u00d7 0.91) = 1.043 to take account of the\nstellar contamination (5.4%) and incompleteness (9%) dis-\ncussed in Section 3.2. While these numbers are derived from\na comparison with the SDSS EDR we note that they are\nvery close to the original estimates given by Maddox et al.\n(1990b). The error bars placed on the measured counts are\nthe rms scatter seen in our 22 mock catalogues and pro-\nvide an estimate of the variation expected due to large scale\nstructure. The dotted curve is the mean number counts in\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n16 P. Norberg et al.\nFigure 10. The 2dFGRS and SDSS galaxy number counts in\nthe bJ and g-bands. In each panel we plot the logarithm of the\nnumber of galaxies per unit apparent magnitude scaled by a Eu-\nclidean model. This enables the ordinate to be expanded so that\nsmall differences in the counts are visible. The upper panel shows\nthe 2dFGRS bJ-band counts separately in the NGP and SGP\nregions. The error bars show the rms variation we expect due\nto large scale structure, estimated from our 22 mock catalogues.\nThe middle panel compares the published SDSS g-band counts of\nYasuda et al. (2001) and our own estimates of the SDSS counts\nin the area which overlaps with the 2dFGRS NGP region. The\nbottom panel compares, in the overlap region, SDSS and 2dFGRS\nbJ-band counts.\nthe mocks and corresponds to the expectation for a homo-\ngeneous universe.\nIt has long been known that the galaxy counts in the\nAPM catalogue are steeper than model predictions for a ho-\nmogeneous universe (Maddox et al. 1990a). As we have sub-\ntracted the Euclidean slope this manifests itself in Fig. 10\nas a shallower slope for the SGP curve than the model\nprediction shown by the dotted curve. The model assumes\n\u21260 = 0.3, \u039b0 = 0.7, the luminosity function estimated in\nthe previous section and the mean k+e-correction estimated\nin Section 4. The NGP counts are greater than those in the\nSGP throughout the range 16 < bJ < 19 and are also slightly\nsteeper than the model prediction (i.e. shallower in Fig. 10),\nalthough the difference is not as extreme as for the SGP.\nThe 1-\u03c3 error bars determined from the mock catalogues\nshow that deviations from the homogeneous model predic-\ntion such as those shown by the NGP should be common.\nThe SGP counts are harder to reconcile with the model, but\nit should be borne in mind that even on quite large scales\nthe galaxy density field is non-gaussian and so 1-\u03c3 error bars\ndo not fully quantify the expected variation.\nTo normalize our estimates of the galaxy luminosity\nfunction we use the cumulative count of galaxies per square\ndegree brighter than bJ = 19.2. In the 740 deg\n2 of the NGP\nstrip this is 151.6\u00b16.1, where the error is again the rms from\nthe mock catalogues. The corresponding numbers for the\n1094 deg2 SGP strip are 141.4 \u00b1 6.1 and, for the combined\n1834 deg2, 146 \u00b1 4.4. The NGP and SGP number counts\ndiffer by 7%, but this is reasonably common in the mock\ncatalogues.\n7.2 Comparison of 2dFGRS and SDSS counts\nThe middle panel in Fig. 10 shows SDSS g-band counts (this\nbeing the SDSS band closest to bJ). We show both the pub-\nlished SDSS counts from Yasuda et al. (2001) and two es-\ntimates we have made directly from the SDSS EDR that\noverlaps with 2dFGRS NGP strip. The counts shown by the\nshort dashed curve are of extended sources that satisfy the\ncriterion used in Yasuda et al. (2001) of rPSF \u2212 rmodel >\n0.145. This criterion, which compares an estimate of the\nmagnitude of an object assuming it to be a point source with\nan estimate obtained by fitting a model galaxy template, is\nvery effective at rejecting faint stars from the sample. The\nvery accurate agreement between the published northern\ncounts and our estimate from the EDR data demonstrates\nthat the simple star-galaxy classification criterion we have\nused works well fainter than g = 17.0 and that we have cor-\nrectly estimated the area of the overlap between the SDSS\nEDR and the NGP region of the 2dFGRS. The Yasuda et\nal. (2001) counts are accurate brighter than g = 17.0 as at\nbrighter magnitudes they utilise a more sophisticated star-\ngalaxy separation algorithm supplemented by visual classifi-\ncation. The galaxy counts shown by the dotted curve are the\ncounts of objects in the EDR database which meet all the cri-\nteria, excluding the cut on r-band magnitude, for inclusion\nin the SDSS main galaxy survey. These counts are system-\natically 8.4% lower than our estimate of the SDSS extended\nsource counts and also the galaxy counts of Yasuda et al.\n(2001). The reason for this is that for inclusion in the SDSS\nmain galaxy survey the sources have to satisfy additional\ncriteria described in Strauss et al. (2002). First a stricter\nextended source criterion (rPSF \u2212 rmodel > 0.3) rejects an\nadditional 2.1% of the objects. A surface brightness thresh-\nold of \u00b5r < 24.5 (comparable to \u00b5bJ = 25.6) rejects a further\n4.1%. Rejection of images containing saturated pixels (prob-\nably stars) removes a further 1.6% and lastly 0.6% of images\nare rejected as blended. Strauss et al. (2002) conclude that\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n2dFGRS bJ-band Luminosity Function 17\nthe galaxy sample they define has a completeness exceed-\ning 99%. This is consistent with the very small (0.36%) of\nspectroscopically confirmed 2dFGRS galaxies whose coun-\nterparts in the SDSS survey do not satisfy the Strauss et al.\n(2002) galaxy selection criteria. We, therefore, conclude the\nthat the Yasuda et al. counts are biased high.\nThe lower panel of Fig. 10 compares SDSS and 2dF-\nGRS bJ galaxy counts within the approximately 173 deg\n2\narea of overlap of the two datasets. Note that this is es-\nsentially the whole of the northern SDSS data. Only small\nareas are discarded where satellite trails and other defects\nhave been cut out of the 2dFGRS sky coverage. Here, we\nhave estimated bJ from the SDSS Petrosian magnitudes us-\ning equation 6, but also including explicitly the 0.058 mag-\nnitude zeropoint offset we measured in Section 3.1. We see\nthat between 18 < bJ < 19, the 2dFGRS and SDSS num-\nber counts agree very accurately. In this area the cumulative\ncount of galaxies per square degree brighter than bJ = 19.2\nis 150, 5% higher than the average over the ten times larger\narea covered by the combined NGP+SGP 2dFGRS strips.\nBetween 17 < bJ < 18 the 2dFGRS counts are approxi-\nmately 8% below the SDSS counts. This accounted for by\nthe slight non-linearity we noted in Section 3.1 between the\nbright (bJ < 18) SDSS and 2dFGRS magnitudes. If we com-\npute the counts for the same 2dFGRS objects, but using the\nmagnitudes derived from the SDSS data then there is better\nagreement between 2dFGRS and SDSS for 17 < bJ < 18.\nBrighter than bJ = 17 the slight decrease in completeness of\nthe 2dFGRS catalogue evident in Fig. 4 also contributes to\na modest reduction in the 2dFGRS galaxy counts.\nWe conclude from this comparison that in the 173 deg2\nregion of overlap, the 2dFGRS counts (corrected using the\nstandard estimates of stellar contamination and incomplete-\nness) are in good agreement with the SDSS galaxy counts\nfainter than bJ = 17, but are 5% higher than those averaged\nover the full area of the 2dFGRS. The 1-\u03c3 statistical error\nestimated from the mock catalogues for an area this size is\n4.8%. Over the full area, we find 146 galaxies per square\ndegree brighter than bJ = 19.2 with a 1-\u03c3 statistical error,\nestimated from mock catalogues, of just 3%.\n8 THE NORMALIZED 2dFGRS LUMINOSITY\nFUNCTION\nWe now use the number counts to normalize our LF esti-\nmates. In doing this we integrate the estimated LF over the\nabsolute magnitude range \u221213 > MbJ \u2212 5log10 h > \u221224.\nThe contribution to the counts from galaxies outside this\nrange is completely negligible.\n8.1 Independent NGP and SGP Estimates\nIn the upper panel of Fig. 11 we present two independent\nestimates of the galaxy luminosity function, from the NGP\nand SGP regions. Here, the LF estimate in each region is\nnormalized by its own galaxy number counts. Thus, the two\nestimates are independent and the differences between them\nprovide an estimate of the statistical errors. These can be\ncompared with the plotted SWML errors, but note should be\ntaken that the SWML errors do not take account of the un-\ncertainty in the normalization of the luminosity function. For\nthese two estimates, the mock catalogues indicate that the\ncontribution to the uncertainty of the normalization from\nlarge scale structure is about 4%. Also of importance is the\nuncertainty in the incompleteness corrections. We have cor-\nrected assuming a global 9% incompleteness in the 2dFGRS\nphotometric catalogue and the uncertainty in this adds, in\nquadrature, approximately 2% to the normalization uncer-\ntainty (see Section 3.1). An indication of this uncertainty is\ngiven by the vertical error bar plotted in the upper right of\neach panel of Fig.11, which, for clarity, shows the \u00b13\u03c3 range.\nIf this is added in quadrature to the SWML errors, then one\nfinds that the differences between the NGP and SGP esti-\nmates are entirely consistent except for magnitudes fainter\nthan MbJ \u2212 5log10 h = \u221217.5.\nAt the faint end, the SGP LF is slightly steeper than\nthat estimated from the NGP. This may reflect genuine spa-\ntial variations in the galaxy luminosity function as this faint\nportion of the luminosity function is determined from a very\nlocal volume. Such variations are perhaps to be expected\ngiven the results of Norberg et al. (2001a; 2002) that show\nthat galaxies of different luminosity have systematically dif-\nferent clustering properties. The faint end of the luminos-\nity function may also be affected by incompleteness and\nmagnitude errors in the 2dFGRS. We have corrected the\nluminosity function assuming that the incompleteness and\nmagnitude errors are independent of absolute magnitude.\nHowever, from the joint analysis of the 2dFGRS and the\nmuch deeper MGC catalogue by Cross et al. (2002b), we\nknow that the magnitude errors are largest for objects of\nextreme surface brightness and also part of the incomplete-\nness is due to the 2dFGRS preferentially missing very low\nsurface brightness galaxies. The correlation between abso-\nlute magnitude and surface brightness (Ferguson & Binggeli\n1994; Driver 1999) then implies that low luminosity galax-\nies are underrepresented. The work of Cross & Driver (2002)\n(see also Cross et al. 2002b) suggests that this only becomes\nimportant fainter than MbJ \u2212 5log10 h = \u221216.5.\nThere are two other significant contributions to the un-\ncertainty in the galaxy luminosity function on an absolute\nscale. The first of these is the zeropoint of the photome-\ntry which has an accuracy of \u00b10.04 magnitudes. The size of\nthis uncertainty is indicated by the horizontal error bar plot-\nted in the upper right of each panel of Fig.11, which shows\nthe \u00b13\u03c3 range. The second important contribution is the\nuncertainty in the appropriate evolutionary correction. Our\nestimates of the galaxy luminosity function are at redshift\nz = 0 and so rely on an accurate model of the k+e correc-\ntions to transform the measured luminosities, which have a\nmedian redshift of zmed \u2248 0.1, to present day values. The\nk+e-corrections we use are accurately constrained by the\nSDSS g\u2212r colours, but are nevertheless model dependent at\nsome level. To gauge the uncertainty in the luminosity func-\ntion due to this uncertainty we made SWML LF estimates\nusing k+e-corrections that were increased or decreased by\nsome factor compared to our standard model. We then con-\nstrained this factor by requiring statistical consistency be-\ntween LF estimates made separately for the data above and\nbelow z = 0.1. The results of this test for the standard k+e-\ncorrection model were shown in Fig. 9d, where it can be\nseen that the two luminosity functions match accurately. We\nfind that if the k+e-corrections are increased or decreased\nby 18%, then the position of the break in the luminosity\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n18 P. Norberg et al.\nFigure 11.

The variations in M\u22c6 and \u03a6\u22c6 are strongly\ncorrelated as for a given value of M\u22c6, \u03a6\u22c6 is determined us-\ning the normalization constraint provided by the number\ncounts. This contribution to the uncertainty in the LF es-\ntimates is indicated by the slanted error bar plotted in the\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n20 P. Norberg et al.\nupper right of each panel of Fig.11, which again shows the\n\u00b13\u03c3 range.\n8.2 Combined NGP+SGP Estimate\nThe lower panel of Fig. 11 combines the SGP and NGP data\nto give our best estimate of the bJ-band galaxy luminosity\nfunction assuming an \u21260 = 0.3 and \u039b0 = 0.7 cosmology. The\npoints with \u00b11\u03c3 error bars show the SWML estimate. Also\nshown are two Schechter functions, whose parameter values\nare indicated in the legend. The first is a simple STY esti-\nmate of the 2dFGRS LF, while the second is obtained by fit-\nting the SWML estimate by a Schechter function convolved\nwith the distribution of magnitude measurement errors es-\ntimated from Fig. 3. We see that deconvolving the effect of\nthe magnitude errors causes only a small reduction in L\u22c6\nand \u03a6\u22c6. We also see that this function convolved with the\nerrors (dotted curve) produces a good match to the SWML\nestimate. Thus, there is little evidence for the underlying\ngalaxy luminosity function differing significantly from the\nSchechter function form.\nThe numerical values of these estimates are listed in\nTables 1 and 2, along with estimates for alternative cos-\nmologies. Note that the SWML estimates refer to the ob-\nserved luminosity function, which is distorted by random\nmagnitude measurement errors. In contrast, the Schechter\nfunction parameters listed in Table 2 refer to the underly-\ning galaxy luminosity function deconvolved for the effect of\nmagnitude measurement errors. In Table 2 we have broken\ndown the errors on the Schechter function parameters into\nthree components. The first is the statistical error returned\nby the STY maximum likelihood method. The large number\nof galaxies used in our estimates makes this statistical error\nvery small and so it is never the dominant contribution to\nthe overall error. The second error is our estimate of the er-\nror induced by the uncertainty in the k+e-corrections. This\nis the dominant contribution to the error in \u03b1 and also a sig-\nnificant contributor to the errors in M\u22c6 and \u03a6\u22c6. The third\nerror given for M\u22c6 in Table 2 is due to the current uncer-\ntainty in the 2dFGRS photometric zeropoint. This will be\nreduced when more calibrating CCD photometry is avail-\nable. The third error given for \u03a6\u22c6 is due to the uncertainty\nin the galaxy number counts and has contributions from\nlarge-scale structure (3%) and from the uncertainty in the\nincompleteness corrections (2%). To determine the overall\nerrors on an absolute scale these contributions should all\nbe added in quadrature. For a complete description of the\nerrors one also needs to consider the correlations between\nthe different parameters. For both the contribution to the\nerrors coming from the uncertainty in the STY parameter\nestimation and from the uncertainty in the k+e-correction\na steeper faint end slope, \u03b1, correlates with brighter M\u22c6.\nThis, in turn, is correlated with \u03a6\u22c6 as the number count\nconstraint implies that a brighter M\u22c6 will produce a lower\n\u03a6\u22c6. In each case the correlation coefficient is large, R \u2248 0.8.\nThe uncertainty in the photometric zeropoint affects only\nM\u22c6, while the uncertainty in the number count constraint\naffects only \u03a6\u22c6. This reduces the correlation between the\nparameter estimates. The final column in Table 2 lists the\nimplied z = 0 luminosity density in solar units. The error\nquoted on this quantity was computed by propagating all the\npreviously mentioned errors. An alternative estimate of the\nerror can be obtained by by estimating the luminosity den-\nsity independently from the NGP and SGP data. This gives\n\u03c1L = 2.04\u00d7108hL\u2299Mpc\u22123 (NGP) and 1.64\u00d7108hL\u2299Mpc\u22123\n(SGP) indicating a very similar mean luminosity density and\nuncertainty.\nThe Schechter function parameters listed in Table 2 for\nthe \u21260 = 0.3, \u039b0 = 0.7 cosmology differ slightly from those\nin Madgwick et al. (2002). This is to be expected as the\nMadgwick et al. luminosity functions are not corrected for\nevolution. That paper focused on the dependence of the lu-\nminosity function on spectral type. Adopting the average\nk-correction of Madgwick et al. and using this in place of\nour k+e-correction on our larger sample (the Madgwick et\nal. sample is truncated at z = 0.15), we find luminosity\nfunction parameters very close to those of Madgwick et al.\n(2002). The remaining, very small differences are accounted\nfor by slightly differing models for the magnitude errors and\nthe adopted normalizations.\n9 COMPARISON WITH INDEPENDENT\nLUMINOSITY FUNCTION ESTIMATES\nIn Fig. 12 we compare the STY and SWML estimates of the\nbJ-band LF from the combined NGP+SGP 2dFGRS sample\ndefined by 17 < bJ < 19.2 and z < 0.25 (shown in Fig 11)\nwith estimates from other surveys. The upper panel com-\npares 2dFGRS with various estimates made from the SDSS.\nIn this comparison we again assume an \u21260 = 0.3, \u039b0 = 0.7\ncosmology. Blanton et al. (2001) presented an estimate of\nthe bJ-band LF for the case of \u21260 = 1.0. We do not use\nthis, but instead estimate the bJ-band LF for our adopted\ncosmology using the g-band LF computed by Blanton et\nal. (2001) for the \u21260 = 0.3, \u039b0 = 0.7 cosmology and the\ntypical B \u2212 V galaxy colour. Using the colour equations of\nFukugita et al. (1996), and assuming bJ = B \u2212 \u03b2(B \u2212 V ),\none finds bJ = g + 0.12 + (0.44 \u2212 \u03b2)(B \u2212 V ). Blanton et\nal. 2001 assumed \u03b2 = 0.35, based on the work of Metcalfe\net al. (1995), and contrary to the commonly-used value of\n\u03b2 = 0.28 (Blair & Gilmore 1982). Thus, an estimate of the\nbJ-band LF can be made by simply taking the g-band esti-\nmate and shifting the magnitudes using this equation with\nB \u2212 V = 0.94, this being the mean colour measured for\ngalaxies brighter than bJ = 19 in the SDSS sample. This\nprocedure can been seen to work quite accurately: when ap-\nplied to the \u21260 = 1 g-band LF parameters given in table 2\nof Blanton et al. (2001), it reproduces the corresponding\nbJ parameters given in their Fig. 23. Taking \u03b2 = 0.35 and\napplying this procedure for the \u21260 = 0.3, \u039b0 = 0.7 cos-\nmology gives M\u22c6bJ \u2212 5log10 h = \u221219.82, \u03b1 = \u22121.26 and\n\u03a6\u22c6 = 2.06\u00d710\u22122h3Mpc\u22123 . This Schechter function is shown\nby the long dashed curve in the upper panel of Fig. 12. As\ndiscussed by Blanton et al. (2001), this estimate is incompat-\nible with the 2dFGRS estimate and predicts a significantly\nhigher luminosity density than we find.\nThe short dashed line in the upper panel of Fig. 12, a\nSchechter function withM\u22c6bJ\u22125log10 h = \u221219.68, \u03b1 = \u22121.26\nand \u03a6\u22c6 = 1.56\u00d710\u22122h3Mpc\u22123, is the result of making three\nmodifications to the Blanton et al. (2001) curve. First, we\nhave shifted M\u22c6bJ by 0.066 magnitudes as is appropriate\nif one adopts the Blair & Gilmore (1982) colour equation\nbJ = B \u2212 0.28(B \u2212 V ) rather than bJ = B \u2212 0.35(B \u2212 V )\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n2dFGRS bJ-band Luminosity Function 21\nFigure 12.

Second, we have shifted M\u22c6bJ by\na further 0.058 to take account of the zeropoint offset be-\ntween the SDSS and 2dFGRS photometry that we found\nin Section 3.1 (Fig. 3c). Finally, we have reduced \u03a6\u22c6 by\n24%, the reduction required for this luminosity function to\nreproduce the mean 2dFGRS number counts at bJ = 19.2\nassuming our standard k+e-correction model. We note that\nYasuda et al. (2001) also found a value of \u03a6\u22c6 significantly\nlower than Blanton et al. when they normalized the SDSS g-\nband luminosity function using the SDSS galaxy counts. The\nYasuda et al. estimate is still higher than our value for two\nreasons. First the Yasuda et al. counts are 8.4% high as they\ninclude extended sources that do not satisfy all the galaxy\nselection criteria used in the main SDSS galaxy sample. Sec-\nond although the SDSS galaxy counts agree with 2dFGRS\nin the area of overlap, this smaller area (173 deg2) has a 5%\nhigher density of galaxies than the full area (1834 deg2) cov-\nered by the 2dFGRS survey (see Section 7). This modified\nSDSS Schechter function is in near perfect agreement with\nthe Schechter function estimated from the 2dFGRS.\nAt the brightest magnitudes, the 2dFGRS SWML esti-\nmate is above both the 2dFGRS STY estimate and the mod-\nified SDSS Schechter function estimate. As we have seen, the\nmain reason for this is that magnitude measurement errors\nin the 2dFGRS have a significant effect on the bright end\nof the luminosity function, but little effect around M\u22c6 and\nfainter. The solid curve surrounded by the shaded region\nshows the result of convolving the modified SDSS estimate\nwith the model of the 2dFGRS magnitude errors shown in\nFig. 3. The shaded region indicates the statistical error on\nthe SDSS estimate and was read from figure 6 of Blanton et\nal. (2001). Comparing this with the 2dFGRS SWML esti-\nmate we see that the two are perfectly consistent, with the\nlarger 2dFGRS sample having significantly smaller statisti-\ncal errors.\nWe have seen that after taking into account the zero-\npoint photometric offset and the error in the colour equation,\nthe only significant difference between the LF estimates of\nBlanton et al. (2001) and the 2dFGRS is a difference in \u03a6\u22c6.\nThis difference arises not because the density of galaxies\nis higher in SDSS than 2dFGRS (the counts agree to 5%),\nbut because of the different methods used to constrain \u03a6\u22c6.\nBlanton et al. used the method of Davis & Huchra (1982)\nwhich weights galaxies as a function of redshift in order to\nobtain a minimum variance estimate of the galaxy density.\nThis method gives more weight to galaxies at high redshift\nthan the method based on normalizing to the counts. It re-\nsults in a smaller statistical error in the normalization, but\nat the same time renders the result more dependent on the\naccuracy of the evolutionary correction. We have seen in Sec-\ntion 8.1 that, even with the low redshift constraint provided\nby the galaxy counts, the uncertainty in \u03a6\u22c6 due to the uncer-\ntainty in the k+e correction is significant. With the Davis &\nHuchra weighting this uncertainty becomes dominant. The\nanalysis by Blanton et al. did not take account of evolution\n\u2013 only k-corrections were applied \u2013 and this appears to have\ngiven rise to an artificially high estimate of \u03a6\u22c6 in the g-\nband. We conclude that, when normalized in the same way,\nthere is excellent agreement between the SDSS and 2dFGRS\nluminosity functions and that the dominant remaining un-\ncertainty in the present day bJ-band LF is due to residual\nuncertainties in evolutionary corrections.\nThe lower panel of Fig. 12 compares the 2dFGRS result\nwith the earlier estimates of Loveday et al. (1992) and Zucca\net al. (1997). We see that the Zucca et al. estimate agrees\nwell with 2dFGRS although it has statistical errors that are\nmuch larger. The main difference with the luminosity func-\ntion of Loveday et al. (1992) is its lower \u03a6\u22c6. Both the 2dF-\nGRS and Loveday et al. estimates are based on catalogues\nextracted from the APM survey. However, the Loveday et\nal. sample is much brighter and almost disjoint from the\nsample analyzed in this paper. As we have seen, the bright\ngalaxy number counts in the SGP drop below model pre-\ndictions extrapolated from fainter magnitudes (Maddox et\nal. 1990a and Section 7) and it is therefore not surprising\nthat Loveday found a lower value of \u03a6\u22c6. Similarly, the flatter\nfaint end slope that they find might be attributed, at least\nin part, to small volume effects. This explanation has been\nargued by Zucca et al. , who find they are able to accurately\nreproduce the Loveday et al. result if they analyze only the\nsubset of their galaxy sample brighter than the bJ < 17.15\nlimit of Loveday et al. (1992).\n10 THE 2dFGRS SELECTION FUNCTION\nThe luminosity function we have derived, combined with\nthe maps defining the survey magnitude limit (see figure 13\nColless et al. 2001), redshift completeness (see Fig. 1) and \u00b5-\nparameter (see Fig. A1) specify the complete selection func-\ntion of the 2dFGRS.\u2021 It is interesting to compare the red-\nshift distribution implied by this selection function with the\nmeasured distribution. Note that the luminosity function\nestimators we employed are insensitive to clustering and so\nthe information contained in the redshift distribution of the\ngalaxies has not been used in determining our model of the\nselection function.\nIn Fig. 13 we compare the smooth redshift distribution\npredicted by our model of the 2dFGRS selection function\nwith the observed distribution. The left-hand panels show\nthe redshift distributions for the full 2dFGRS survey split\ninto the SGP and NGP regions. The right-hand panels show\nthe distributions only for galaxies brighter than bJ = 18.5.\nThe dotted lines indicate the rms variation in the redshift\nhistograms found in our 22 mock 2dFGRS catalogues. Grav-\nitational clustering produces a pattern of galaxy clustering\nthat is non-gaussian, composed of voids, walls, filaments and\n\u2021 The only significant aspects of the 2dFGRS selection function\nignored in this description are surface brightness issues (see Cross\net al. 2002b) and the undersampling of close galaxy pairs induced\nby the mechanical limits on the positioning of the optical fibres\nthat feed the 2dF spectrographs. Note that as the 2dF fields over-\nlap, not all close galaxy pairs are missed. We have found that\nwhen making estimates of galaxy clustering an accurate way of\ndealing with this incompleteness is to assign the weight of the\nmissed galaxies to neighbouring galaxies with redshifts. We typ-\nically distribute the weight of a missed galaxy between its 10\nnearest neighbours and find that this produces accurate cluster-\ning estimates on scales greater than 1.5 arcmin or \u223c 0.2h\u22121Mpc\n(Norberg 2001b).\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n2dFGRS bJ-band Luminosity Function 23\nFigure 13. Redshift distributions in the 2dFGRS and mock catalogues. The histograms show the observed redshift distribution in the\nNGP and SGP regions of the 2dFGRS. The left-hand panels are to the full depth of the survey while the right-hand panels include only\ngalaxies brighter than bJ = 18.5. The smooth solid curves show the predicted redshift distributions based on our Schechter function\nestimate of the galaxy luminosity function, including the magnitude measurement errors, the variation in the survey magnitude limit and\nthe dependence of completeness on apparent magnitude. The dotted lines indicate the rms variation in the redshift histograms within\nour ensemble of 22 mock galaxy catalogues.\nclusters (e.g. see figures 8 to 15 of Cole et al. 1998 for mock\n2dFGRS and SDSS cone plots). As a result, the rms vari-\nation in the N(z) distribution does not give an adequate\ndescription of the variation seen in the mock catalogues.\nFor this reason we show in Fig. 14 two examples of the red-\nshift distributions found in our ensemble of mock catalogues.\nFrom these we see that the few large spikes present in the\nN(z) of the 2dFGRS data are common features in the mock\ncatalogue redshift distributions.\nThe redshift distribution in the 2dFGRS NGP has a\nlarge spike close to the peak of the selection function and\notherwise lies within 1-\u03c3 of our smooth selection function.\nThus, the density field in the NGP strip looks in no way\nunusual when compared to the expectation in the standard\n\u039bCDM (\u21260 = 0.3, \u039b0 = 0.7) universe. In contrast, the den-\nsity field in the SGP appears more extreme. Focusing first\non the redshift distribution below z < 0.2, we see that the\nobserved galaxy density is nearly always below the mean\ndensity predicted by the selection function. This behaviour\nis consistent with the steep APM galaxy number counts, first\nnoted by Maddox et al. (1990a), and discussed in Section 7\nabove. A lower than average galaxy density over such a large\nrange of redshift is certainly not a common occurrence. How-\never, as illustrated by the example of the mock SGP plotted\nin Fig. 14, which in many respects is quite similar to the\nobserved 2dFGRS SGP, comparable variations do occur in\nthe mock \u039bCDM catalogues. The two examples plotted in\nFig. 14 were not chosen at random, but as we only have 22\nmocks to choose from, they do not represent extreme possi-\nbilities.\nThe 2dFGRS SGP strip also appears to show an over-\ndensity, relative to the mean implied by the selection func-\ntion, in the redshift range 0.2 < z < 0.25. As the volume\ncontributing to this redshift interval is very large, a variation\nas extreme as this is very unlikely. It therefore seems implau-\nsible that this perturbation in N(z) is due solely to large-\nscale structure. There are some structures at this redshift\nthat contribute to the excess, but even if they are excised\nthe N(z) remains higher than the model. At z > 0.2 the\nonly galaxies which make it into the 2dFGRS are one to two\nmagnitudes brighter than M\u22c6, where the galaxy luminosity\nfunction is very steep. Thus, a small shift in magnitude can\nresult in a large change in the number of galaxies brighter\nthan the survey magnitude limit. We cannot reject the pos-\nsibility of a small offset between the absolute calibration\nof the NGP and SGP; indeed, Section 3 has indicated an\noffset of 0.058 magnitudes \u2013 assuming both EIS and SDSS\nphotometry to be perfect. This is in the sense required to\nunderstand Fig. 13, i.e. the SGP is effectively deeper than\nthe NGP. Any true offset cannot be much larger than this,\notherwise it would spoil the good agreement of the STY LFs\nin Fig 11. Nevertheless, an NGP\u2013SGP offset of between 0.05\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n24 P. Norberg et al.\nFigure 14. As Fig. 13, but for two selected mock catalogues rather than the genuine 2dFGRS.\nand 0.1 magnitudes would yield a better match to N(z) at\nz > 0.2, and this possibility must be borne in mind, pend-\ning further tests against CCD data. Another possibility that\nneeds further investigation is that the random magnitude\nmeasurement errors become larger for faint objects at high\nz. A trend of this sort is not evident in the comparison we\nhave made between 2dFGRS and SDSS EDR magnitudes\nin Fig 3, but this comparison pertains to the NGP only.\nFor now one should be careful, as we have been in previous\npapers, to ensure that large-scale clustering results are not\nstrongly influenced by this feature. For instance, the esti-\nmate of the large scale galaxy power spectrum in Percival\net al. (2001) used separate selection functions, which empir-\nically matched the high-z N(z) in both NGP and SGP.\n11 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nWe have described the calibration of the 2dFGRS photome-\ntry and used the CCD data of the SDSS EDR (Stoughton et\nal. 2002) to assess the accuracy and completeness of the 2dF-\nGRS photometric catalogue, which is based on APM scans\nof the UKST photographic plates (Maddox et al. 1990c).\nWe find that the measurement errors in the APM magni-\ntudes are in agreement with previous estimates, having a\n1-\u03c3 spread (robustly estimated) of 0.164 magnitudes. We\nfind a small zeropoint offset between the SDSS EDR and\nthe 2dFGRS photometry of |\u2206| = 0.058 and no evidence\nfor any scale error in the magnitude calibration in the range\n17 < bJ < 19.5. As more calibrating data become available,\nthe accuracy of both the 2dFGRS and SDSS photometric\nzeropoints should be improved. We find that compared to\nthe SDSS photometric catalogue, the 2dFGRS parent cat-\nalogue is 91 \u00b1 2% complete. This agrees with the original\nestimates based on the accuracy of star-galaxy classification\nin the APM catalogue (Maddox et al. 1990b). The reasons\nbehind the 9 \u00b1 2% of galaxies that are missed are investi-\ngated in more detail in Cross et al. (2002b), who compare the\n2dFGRS parent catalogue with the MGC, a deep, wide area\nB-band CCD imaging survey (Lemon et al. 2002). They find\nthat mis-classification (e.g. galaxies incorrectly classified as\nmerged images or stars) is the largest cause of incomplete-\nness, but also a small population of low surface brightness\ngalaxies is missed.\nMaking simple statistical corrections for incomplete-\nness, magnitude measurement errors and uncertainties in\nmodelling evolution and k-corrections, we find that the true\nz = 0 galaxy luminosity function is accurately described\nby a Schechter function with parameters: M\u22c6bJ \u2212 5log10 h =\n\u221219.66 \u00b1 0.07, \u03b1 = \u22121.21 \u00b1 0.03 and \u03a6\u22c6= (1.61 \u00b1 0.08) \u00d7\n10\u22122h3Mpc\u22123 (assuming an \u21260 = 0.3, \u039b0 = 0.7 cosmology).\nWith over 110 500 redshifts, the statistical errors in our es-\ntimate are negligible compared to the systematic errors (i.e.\nuncertainties that cause an overall shift of the luminosity\nfunction) from fluctuations produced by large-scale struc-\nture and by the uncertainty in the evolutionary corrections.\nOur quoted errors include estimates of these uncertainties,\nthe former derived from extensive, realistic mock catalogues.\nTaking account of the photometric zeropoint difference,\nrandom magnitude measurement errors, and using an accu-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n2dFGRS bJ-band Luminosity Function 25\nrate colour equation, we find very good agreement between\nthe form of the bJ-band LF inferred from the SDSS data\nand the 2dFGRS estimate. Also, in the area of overlap, the\n2dFGRS and SDSS galaxy counts agree at bJ = 19.2. This\nis the magnitude at which we use the counts to normalize\nour luminosity function. Thus, when normalized in the same\nway, 2dFGRS and SDSS bJ-band LF estimates agree with\ngreat accuracy. Blanton et al. (2001) reached a different con-\nclusion principally because they used an inaccurate colour\nequation to convert from SDSS wavebands to bJ and did not\ntake account of galaxy evolution.\nThe integrated z = 0 bJ-band luminosity density im-\nplied by the 2dFGRS LF is (1.82\u00b1 0.17) \u00d7 108h L\u2299Mpc\u22123.\nThis is in good agreement with earlier estimates from the\n2dFGRS presented in Folkes et al. (1999) and Madgwick et\nal. (2002) although neither of these estimates took account\nof the small effect of modelling evolution and the Folkes et\nal. estimate assumed an \u21260 = 1 cosmology. The dependence\nof the estimated luminosity density on corrections made for\nlow surface brightness galaxies is studied in Cross et al.\n(2002b), which supercedes Cross et al. (2001a). The ear-\nlier paper modelled the 2dFGRS magnitudes as gaussian-\ncorrected isophotal magnitudes, in the same way as Blan-\nton et al. (2001). Ignoring the manner in which the 2dF-\nGRS magnitudes are calibrated using deeper CCD magni-\ntudes led to an overestimate of the amount of light lost.\nCross et al. (2002b) show that the luminosity function es-\ntimated here agrees well with an estimate from the deeper\nMGC catalogue and that dependencies on surface brightness\nonly significantly affect the luminosity function fainter than\nMbJ \u2212 5log10 h = \u221216.5. Consequently the systematic effect\non the estimated luminosity density is only 5 to 10%.\nWright (2001) has highlighted that the luminosity den-\nsity measured in the optical bands by the SDSS (Blanton et\nal. 2001), combined with a simple model for the expected\nmean spectrum, predicts a luminosity density in the KS-\nband a factor of 2.3 greater than the value measured in the\njoint analysis of 2MASS (Jarrett et al. 2000) and 2dFGRS\npresented in Cole et al. (2001). Note that Kochanek et al.\n(2001) found a very similar KS-band luminosity density to\nthat found by Cole et al. (2001), but their estimate used\n2MASS isophotal magnitudes for which the correction to\ntotal magnitudes is more uncertain. Even if the SDSS lu-\nminosity densities were to be revised downwards to agree\nwith the 2dFGRS in the bJ-band, the discrepancy in the\nKS-band would only be reduced to a factor of 1.6. Further-\nmore, the correction for longer wavelength bands is likely to\nbe smaller than that we have inferred for the g-band. Thus,\na puzzling factor of approximately 1.8 to 2 remains between\nthe KS-band luminosity density measured from 2MASS and\nthat inferred by extrapolation from the optical bands.\nWright (2001) speculated that the 2MASS fluxes could\nbe grossly underestimated. This possibility is ruled out\nby the comparison of 2MASS magnitudes with those from\ndeeper, high resolution KS-band images. Cole et al. (2001)\ncompared 2MASS magnitudes with Kron magnitudes mea-\nsured for the same objects by Loveday (2000) and found that\nonly a 0.06 magnitude correction was needed to bring them\ninto agreement. A somewhat larger larger offset, but still\nonly 20%, has been argued for by Andreon (2002). Further-\nmore, combining the 2MASS and SDSS EDR magnitudes\nfor matched objects, we find optical to near infrared colours\nwhich, on average, agree well with the mean galaxy spec-\ntrum adopted by Wright. A second speculation made by\nWright was that perhaps the 2MASS extended source cata-\nlogue is incomplete and misses a significant fraction of the\ngalaxies that SDSS detects. This is also appears unlikely.\nThe assessment of the completeness of 2dFGRS compared\nto 2MASS presented in Cole et al. (2001), together with\nthe assessment of the 2dFGRS completeness with respect to\nthe SDSS presented here, shows that the 2MASS and SDSS\nsource densities agree to about 2%.\nThe most likely cause of the discrepancy between the\nKS-band and extrapolated optical luminosity densities is\nlarge-scale structure. Since the 2MASS survey has a much\nbrighter limiting magnitude than either the 2dFGRS or\nSDSS, their luminosity functions are not normalized within\nthe same volume. Cole et al. (2001) normalized their KS-\nband LF using an estimate of the counts from a small,\n184 deg2 area (Jarrett et al. in preparation) and an indi-\nrect estimate from the approximately 619 deg2 of overlap\nbetween 2MASS and 2dFGRS. The second estimate is per-\nhaps not highly accurate, because it requires an estimate of\nthe effective area of sky in the intersection of the 2dFGRS\nand 2MASS. This is not trivial to obtain because a map\nof the 2MASS sky coverage is not yet available. Cole et al.\n(2001) estimated that large-scale structure would cause a\n15% variation in the number counts within a 619 deg2 area.\nOur mock catalogues, modified to mimic the selection crite-\nria of the 2MASS, show that the rms variation in the counts\nover a 184 deg2 area is, significantly larger, 19%. Thus, it\nwill be very interesting to derive the KS-band counts over a\nlarger area, which should soon become possible with a more\ncomplete 2MASS catalogue, to see whether the estimates\nof the J and KS-band luminosity densities and the inferred\nstellar density need to be revised.\nWe have described maps that define the redshift com-\npleteness of the current 2dFGRS catalogue and the weak\ndependence of the degree of completeness on apparent mag-\nnitude. These, together with the luminosity function and a\nmap of the survey magnitude limit, provide a complete de-\nscription of the 2dFGRS selection function. We have created\nmock galaxy catalogues from cosmological N-body simula-\ntions using this description of the selection function. Com-\nparison of these with the observed data indicates that, in\ngeneral, the data are well described by our selection function\nand exhibit fluctuations that are typical of those expected\nin the standard \u039bCDM cosmology.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe data used here were obtained with the 2 degree field\nfacility on the 3.9m Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT).

However,\nat this intermediate stage, when only a subset of the target\n2dF fields have been observed, the fraction of redshifts mea-\nsured varies considerably with position. As detailed in Sec-\ntion 8 of Colless et al. (2001), this variation is best quantified\nby dividing the survey into sectors (labelled by an angular\nposition \u03b8) defined by the overlaps of the target 2dF fields.\nWithin each of these sectors one can calculate the fraction\nR(\u03b8) of the parent catalogue galaxies whose redshifts have\nbeen measured. It is this completeness map, pixellated for\nconvenience, that is shown in Fig. 1.\nIn contrast to most previous redshift surveys, the 2dF-\nGRS is so large that residual small systematic errors can\nbegin to dominate over statistical errors. For this reason, we\nhave developed a quantitative description of the dependence\nof the completeness on apparent magnitude. Note that 76%\nof the observed fields have an overall completeness of greater\nthan 90% (this should increase with time as some of the\nlower completeness fields are re-observed) and so generally\nincompleteness and its dependence on apparent magnitude\nare small. In Section 8.3 of Colless et al. (2001), we showed\nthat for each observed field the dependence of the redshift\ncompleteness on apparent magnitude could be described by\na one parameter function (see figure 16 of Colless et al. 2001)\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n2dFGRS bJ-band Luminosity Function 27\nFigure A1. Map showing the variation of the parameter \u00b5 with position on the sky. The dependence of the redshift completeness on\napparent magnitude is accurately described by the fitting function cz(bJ, \u00b5) = 0.99 (1\u2212 exp[bJ \u2212 \u00b5]).\ncz(bJ, \u00b5i) = 0.99 (1\u2212 exp[bJ \u2212 \u00b5i]) . (A1)\nHere bJ is the apparent magnitude and \u00b5i is the value of\nthe parameter for field i. In each sector, the targeted galax-\nies are split between several fields and so one must define\nan appropriately averaged value, \u00b5(\u03b8), for each sector. This\ncan be derived by writing the magnitude-dependent redshift\nincompleteness of a sector cz(bJ, \u00b5(\u03b8)) as a weighted sum of\nthe completeness of its NF(\u03b8) component fields,\ncz(bJ, \u00b5[\u03b8]) =\nNF(\u03b8)\u2211\ni=1\nfi cz(bJ, \u00b5i), (A2)\nwhere fi is the fraction of observed galaxies in this sector\nthat were targeted in field i. Hence by identification of terms\ncz(bJ, \u00b5i) = 0.99 (1\u2212 exp[bJ \u2212 \u00b5(\u03b8)]) , (A3)\nwhere\n\u00b5(\u03b8) = \u2212 ln\n[\nNF(\u03b8)\u2211\ni=1\nfi exp(\u2212\u00b5i)\n]\n. (A4)\nWith this one can define the function\nS(\u03b8,bJ) = R(\u03b8) cz(bJ, \u00b5[\u03b8])\/c\u00afz(\u00b5[\u03b8]) (A5)\nwhich is an estimate of the fraction of galaxies of apparent\nmagnitude bJ in the sector at position \u03b8 that have redshift\nmeasurements. Here c\u00afz(\u00b5[\u03b8]) is cz(bJ, \u00b5[\u03b8]) averaged over\nthe expected apparent magnitude distribution of the galax-\nies in the sector.\nMaps of bJ\nlim(\u03b8), R(\u03b8) and \u00b5(\u03b8) together with associ-\nated software are available for the 2dFGRS data in the 100k\nRelease (http:\/\/www.mso.anu.edu.au\/2dFGRS\/). Here, we\nemploy the method described in section 8 of Colless et al.\n(2001) to generate these quantities for the more extensive\ndataset used in this paper. The map of R(\u03b8) is shown\nin Fig. 1 and the corresponding map of \u00b5(\u03b8) is shown in\nFig. A1.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n"}
