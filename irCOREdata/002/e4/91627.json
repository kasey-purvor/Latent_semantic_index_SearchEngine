Brown\nIntroduction\nThe service literature views quality as\npredominately a measurement based on the\ncustomer\u2019 s view of the service received, yet\nwriters in the quality literature argue that\nservices need to learn, from manufacturing,\nthe ability to manage quality internally. The\nincreasing number of registrations of service\nfirms to an ISO 9000 standard suggests that\nthis internal view of service quality is gaining\nground. In service industries the world-wide\ntake-up of quality management system\nregistration to the ISO 9000 standard has\nincreased rapidly, with more than 71,000\nservice organisations registered at the\nbeginning of the year 2000. Service industries\nnow account for over 26 per cent of all\nregistrations and show the greatest growth.\nSome service sectors such as public\nadministration, and hotels and restaurants\nhave doubled their number of registrations in\n1999, while others such as wholesale and\nretail have grown to become the fifth largest\noverall industry sector (ISO, 2000a).\nAlthough there is a considerable body of\nresearch exploring quality system\naccreditation in manufacturing, research,\nparticularly empirical research in service\nindustries, is limited. Given the increasing\nnumber of service organisations pursuing\nquality management system accreditation, it\nis clearly important to investigate whether or\nnot it can make a profound difference to the\nway service quality is perceived and\nmeasured.\nThe research data analysed in this article\nwere obtained by questionnaire survey of the\nchief executives of 270 large service\ncompanies. In this research, we examine\ndifferences in quality measurement emphasis\nand usage, and how these change relative to\nthe importance placed on accreditation to an\nISO 9000 standard. The effect of process\nstructure is also explored by categorising\nservice firms, as being in front \u00ad versus\nback-room dominant \u00ad industrial sectors.\nThe research finds empirical evidence that\nservice firms which rate quality accreditation\nas important, have a balanced perspective\nwhere both internal and customer\nmeasurements of quality are used extensively.\nIn contrast, service firms which do not rate\nquality accreditation as important emphasise\nquality measurement less. In the absence of\nquality accreditation, we find a clear\nThe authors\nGavin Dick is a Senior Lecturer at Staffordshire University\nBusiness School, Stoke on Trent, UK.\nKevin Gallimore is a Senior Lecturer, Manchester\nMetropolitan University, Crewe, UK.\nJane C.

The paper\nthen goes on to formulate the research\nquestions and explain the methodology used\nbefore examining and discussing the findings.\nPrevious research\nService process structure and quality\nemphasis\nIn some service industries, the pursuit of\nservice efficiency has followed the path\ndescribed by Chase (1981). He suggested that\nlowering the proportion of customer contact\ntime, by standardising the product and\ntransactions at the customer interface,\nlowered the uncertainty introduced, and,\ntherefore, gave greater protection from\nunpredictability to the technical core. This\nprotection of the technical core from\nunpredictability allows greater scope for the\nadoption of process structures with de-\ncoupled back-room activities. Chase (1978)\nand Chase and Tansik (1983) argued that the\nlogic of manufacturing organisations could be\napplied to these de-coupled back-room\nactivities. The ultimate stage in this is\nSchemenner\u2019 s (1986) service factory concept\nwhere the firms\u2019 products and processes are\nstandardised and labour is leveraged by\ncapital investment. Here customer interaction\nis low, and the process repetitive, so allowing\nthe maximum scope for designing factory-like\nprocesses, including the use of technology\nand specialisation of labour.\nHowever, manufacturing thinking has\nchanged since the idea of service\nindustrialisation was first suggested in the late\n1970s. The focus is no longer on treating\npeople as though they were machines. The\nemphasis is now on the elimination of non-\nadded value activities, a focus on core\nactivities and teamwork alongside employee\nempowerment. Bowen and Youngdahl\n(1998) argue that these \u2019\u2019 lean\u2019\u2019 changes mean\nthat the production line approaches to service\nboth do, and should, continue to transfer\nfrom manufacturing to service. Bowen and\nYoungdahl (1998) argue that many of the\nrecent advances in service design and delivery\nthat have been lauded as departures from\nservice industrialisation in fact represent\nadvancement in service industrialisation.\nThey argue that successful service firms such\nas Taco Bell, Southwest Airlines and\nShouldice Hospital do not represent a unique\nservice industry approach but are the\napplication of current \u2019\u2019 lean thinking\u2019\u2019\nmanufacturing ideas. As in manufacturing,\nthe lack of slack in these lean systems makes a\nsystematic approach to quality essential.\nThe pursuit of service efficiency described\nabove has arguably resulted in an increase in\nback-room activity in many service industries\n(Beaumont et al., 1997), along with efforts to\nstandardise the product and transactions at\nthe customer interface, a process vividly\ndescribed as \u2019\u2019McDonaldization\u2019\u2019 by Ritzer\n(1995). Recent advances in communication\nand information technology have accelerated\nthis process. It appears that, although\ntechnology changes the way a service is\ndelivered by redefining the location and\nboundaries of front-room activities, it does\nnot undermine the logic of buffering the\nback-room from customer intervention.\nAcross the spectrum of service industries,\nwe would expect variations in quality\nemphasis that relates to their front-room\nversus back-room structure. Firms with low\nlevels of customer contact are classed as\n\u2019\u2019quasi manufacturing\u2019\u2019 by Chase (1981).\nThese have larger back-room activities that\nare de-coupled from the unpredictability of\nfront-room activities. Here the service is\nstandardised, making the specification and\nmeasurement of the service delivery process\nmuch easier. The de-coupling of front- and\nback-room processes allows the back-room\nactivities to focus on measuring and\ncontrolling quality to meet the specification\nconsistently (internal measurement), while\nthe front-room activities will be more\ncustomer-service orientated and emphasise\nthe quality of the service encounter and the\ncustomers\u2019 measurement of the service result\n(customer-based measurement).\nThe review above suggests that the balance\nbetween quality measurements will be\ndictated by the process structure of the service\nfirm. Firms where a minority of staff has\ndirect customer contact are likely to have\nlarge de-coupled back-room operations. In\nthese firms there is likely to be an increased\nemphasis on the measurement of the quality\n41\nDoes ISO 9000 accreditation make a profound difference?\nGavin Dick, Kevin Gallimore and Jane C. Brown\nManaging Service Quality\nVolume 12 . Number 1 . 2002 . 30\u00b142\nof the service-delivery process (internal). In\ncontrast, service firms that have a majority of\nstaff with direct customer contact will have\nfewer staff working in de-coupled back-room\noperations and so have less emphasis on\ninternal quality measurement compared to\nmeasures of customer satisfaction.\nWhat seems to be absent in the literature is\nresearch that informs us of whether service\nfirms that pursue quality management system\nregistration have a different emphasis on\nquality measurement compared to non-\nregistered firms.\nQuality accreditation\nThe ISO 9001:2000 quality management\nsystem standards claim to be applicable to any\norganisation, large or small, whatever its\nproduct \u00ad independent of whether its\n\u2019\u2019product\u2019\u2019 is actually a service \u00ad in any sector\nof activity, and whether it is a business\nenterprise, a public administration, or a\ngovernment department. The specification of\nquality criteria in ISO 9001:2000 refers to all\nthose features of a product or a service that\nare required by the customer, while quality\nmanagement in ISO 9001:2000 means what\nthe organisation does to ensure that its\nproducts\/services conform to the customer\u2019 s\nrequirements. A quality management system\nregistration gained to an ISO 9000 standard\nmeans that an independent auditor has\nchecked that the organisational processes\ninfluencing quality meet the relevant\nstandard\u2019 s requirements (ISO, 2000b).\nInferred in the pursuit of quality\naccreditation is the assumption that it is\nassociated with improved quality\nmanagement systems, leading to better\nquality and, hence, to better business\nperformance. The expected links are shown in\nTable I. The model shows the approved\nquality management system bringing an\nincreased emphasis on quality in the firm\u2019 s\nprocesses, which leads to less waste or\nduplication of effort, and improved service\nquality. These improvements lower costs\nwhile the improved quality means fewer\ncustomer defections, leading to increased\nsales volume.\nSupport for the proposition that better\nquality has a positive relationship with\nbusiness performance in service industries is\nprovided by Capon et al. (1990), who\nidentified 20 studies that found a positive\nrelationship. In addition, Rust et al. (1994)\ncame to a similar conclusion in their review of\nthe marketing literature on service quality and\nfinancial returns. However, the research we\nnow examine on the links between quality\naccreditation and improved performance\nreveals that the performance gains expected\nare not consistently achieved. Motives appear\nto be an important predictor of performance,\nwhich leads us to conclude that simply using\npossession of a quality management system\nregistration, as a research variable is\nproblematic.\nInsights into the reasons for pursuing\nquality accreditation, and the effect this has\non subsequent business performance, are\nprovided by the Science and Engineering\nPolicy Studies Unit (1994) study that\nreviewed 28 surveys relating to ISO 9000. It\nconcluded that there appears to be a\nrelationship between managers\u2019 motives for\nobtaining accreditation and gains achieved in\nbusiness performance. Companies that cited\ncustomer pressure as their reason for pursuing\naccreditation were less likely to report\nimprovements than those who gave other\nreasons for obtaining accreditation. Other\nstudies (Gore, 1994) have suggested that\norganisations reacting to external pressure\nmay see quality management system\nregistration as the prime objective and adopt a\nminimalist approach to achieve it. These\nfirms may have successfully obtained\nTable I The expected links between ISO quality accreditation and business performance\nISO 9000\nregistration Quality management system Quality improvement focus Business performance\nAccredited to\nISO 9000\nstandard\nThe approved quality management\nsystem brings an increased\nemphasis on quality in the firm\u2019s\nprogress\nInternal quality measurement\nReduce waste and improve\nquality of service outputs\nReduced costs improve\ncompetitivenes\nCustomer quality measurement\nImprove match of service quality\nto customers\u2019 expectations\nFewer customer defections\nso sales increase\n42\nDoes ISO 9000 accreditation make a profound difference?\nGavin Dick, Kevin Gallimore and Jane C.

Number 1 . 2002 . 30\u00b142\naccreditation of their quality management\nsystem but they do not value the quality\nmanagement system that quality accreditation\nrequires.\nThese studies infer that the motive for\nseeking accreditation is an important\npredictor of performance. Insights into this\nmotivation variable are provided by an\nempirical study of 272 Australian firms by\nJones et al. (1997). They found evidence\nthat firms that sought quality accreditation\nbecause of externally imposed perceptions\nof the necessity to \u2019\u2019 be registered\u2019\u2019 were\nfound to experience fewer beneficial\noutcomes of quality accreditation than firms\nwhich had a more \u2019\u2019 developmental\u2019\u2019 view of\nquality improvement. Firms with a more\ndevelopmental orientation reported less\nwaste and duplication of effort, fewer\ncustomer complaints and, to a lesser\nextent, more business and lower operating\ncosts.\nThese developmental firms\u2019 motives\nincluded a desire to use quality accreditation\nto improve the company\u2019 s internal processes,\nand\/or help lower quality costs and increase\ncustomer focus. Support for this view is found\nin a survey of 192 Dutch firms where financial\nbenefits were contingent on firms having\ninternal reasons for pursuing accreditation\n(Singels et al., 2001).\nOverall, it would seem that quality\nmanagement system registration has little or\nno explanatory power in terms of\norganisational performance, unless complex\nvariables such as motives or orientations are\ntaken into account (for a more detailed\nanalysis see Dick (2000)).\nA more direct variable that captures\nwhether the ISO 9000 quality management\nsystem is embedded in the firm\u2019 s thinking\ncould have the potential to avoid these\nmeasurement problems. If a firm has an\nembedded quality management system and it\nis registered, then it could be expected that\nthe firm would rate quality accreditation as\nimportant to the way it defines quality. In\nother words, the process of obtaining quality\nmanagement system registration has changed\nthe way the firm specifies its quality criteria.\nTherefore, in this research, the intent is to\nmeasure the \u2019\u2019value\u2019\u2019 placed on quality\naccreditation\u2019 s contribution to an\norganisation\u2019 s definition of quality. How this\nis operationalised will be detailed in the\nmethodology section.\nQuality measurement\nThe service literature predominately views\nquality as a measure that is external to the\nfirm, usually based on the customers\u2019 view of\nthe service received. Yet, writers in the quality\nliterature such as Gummesson (1991) argue\nthat services need to learn from\nmanufacturing the need for consistent quality,\nand the ability to manage quality internally.\nThe increasing number of service firms\npursuing accreditation to ISO 9000 standards\nsuggests that this broader view of service\nquality is gaining ground amongst\npractitioners. The revised ISO 9001:2000\nstandard, published in December 2000, will\nno doubt accelerate this because the new\nstandards will have a greater appeal to service\nfirms, since they have less of a manufacturing\nbias and have, as their first principle, the\ncustomer-focused organisation. The new\nstandards stress the importance of monitoring\ninformation on customer satisfaction as a\nmeasure of system performance, and the\nsignificance of people involvement and\ncontinual improvement in the service process.\nThe standard describes the importance of\nboth internal and customer-based\nmeasurement of quality, and emphasises that\nboth are needed if service performance\nanalysis of marketing, design and production\/\nservice delivery processes are to be effective\n(ISO, 2000b).\nIn this research the quality constructs\nresemble the concepts in ISO 9001:2000. We\nuse the term \u2019\u2019conformance\u2019\u2019 to describe the\ninternal quality measurement of service-\ndelivery process to the service specification,\nservice delivery specification and quality\ncontrol specification. The term \u2019\u2019expectation\ngap\u2019\u2019 is used to describe measurement of the\ncustomer\u2019 s satisfaction with the overall service\nresult.\nWe therefore use in this research two broad\nquality measures. Conformance that reflects\nthe dominant quality focus in back-room\nprocesses that is a measure of internal quality,\nand expectation gap that reflects customer-\nbased measurement of quality performance\n(similarities and differences with\nSERVQUAL will be discussed later). The\nterm \u2019\u2019 internal quality\u2019\u2019 needs to be explained\ncarefully since the way the term is used in the\nquality literature differs from that in the\nservice literature. It does not mean in this\npaper the \u2019\u2019 internal service quality\u2019\u2019 referred to\nby service researchers such as Schneider and\n44\nDoes ISO 9000 accreditation make a profound difference?\nGavin Dick, Kevin Gallimore and Jane C. Brown\nManaging Service Quality\nVolume 12 . Number 1 . 2002 . 30\u00b1\nBowen (1993), Reynoso and Moores (1995)\nor Gremler et al. (1994). Their \u2019\u2019 internal\nquality\u2019\u2019 relates to the quality experienced by\ninternal employees from internal service\nproviders using variations of the SERVQUAL\nmodel of quality. Clearly, their research is\nimportant to our understanding of how poor\ninternal quality can affect employee attitudes\nand therefore customer satisfaction with the\nservice, but it is not suitable as a measure in\nthe context of accreditation to an ISO 9000\nstandard. Our internal quality dimension\nconformance takes the IS0 9001:2000\nperspective, it refers to the firm\u2019s own\nmonitoring of the conformance of internal\nprocesses to predetermined measures of\nquality. These predetermined quality\nmeasures reflect either the firm\u2019s\nunderstanding of a particular customer\u2019 s\nservice brief or more generic standards that\nreflect what all customers expect.\nConformance quality can be equated to the\nconformance dimension of Garvin (1987),\nwhile the expectation-gap measurement is\nsimilar to the \u2019\u2019perceived service quality\u2019\u2019 in\nParasuraman et al.\u2019 s (1988) SERVQUAL\nmodel. Thus, the expectation gap is a quality\nmeasure that is based on the customer\u2019 s\nexpectations of the service versus the service\nresult and so represents the degree of success\nin meeting customers\u2019 performance\nexpectations. Therefore, it goes beyond\nconformance quality since it also measures\nwhether the service specification accurately\nreflects customers\u2019 expectations. Put another\nway, conformance quality measurement may\nconfirm that the service system meets the\nservice specification but the specification itself\nmay not accurately reflect customer needs.\nSo, the expectation-gap measure provides an\nessential feedback loop that informs\nmarketing and design processes as well as\nservice-delivery processes. Thus ISO\n9001:2000 (ISO, 2000b) quality management\nsystems articulate a balanced perspective\nwhere both an operations\/internal perspective\nand marketing\/customer perspective are\ncombined.\nIn summary, we use in this research two\nquality measures that reflect the dominant\nquality focus in front-room and back-room\nprocesses. Conformance is used to describe\nthe dimension that involves measuring\/\ncontrolling service delivery processes to\nensure that they meet specifications, and are\nlikely to be dominant in back-room processes,\nwhile the other, termed expectation gap,\ndescribes the customers\u2019 overall satisfaction\nwith the service result compared with their\nexpectations.\nResearch question and methodology\nResearch questions\nFrom the literature reviewed, it is clear that\nquality management system registration will\nonly be associated with a greater emphasis on\nquality where firms value the quality\nmanagement system that quality accreditation\nrequires. We therefore frame the research\nquestions used in the survey so as to\ndistinguish respondents by their rating of the\nimportance of quality accreditation in\ncontributing to their definition of quality\nrather than by their accreditation. We term\nthis variable \u2019\u2019QCert value\u2019\u2019 . High QCert\nvalue ratings will indicate higher degrees of\nimportance of quality accreditation in\ncontributing to the firm\u2019s definition of quality,\nwhich implies that their certified quality\nmanagement system is making a valuable\ncontribution to the way in which the firm\nmanages quality. The framing of this critical\nQCert value question was difficult. Its final\nquestionnaire form, \u2019\u2019Please rate in\nimportance the possession of a recognised\nquality certificate (e.g. BS 5750, ISO 9000) in\ncontributing to your definition of quality\u2019\u2019 ,\nwas arrived at after many internal debates on\nhow to separate those who valued quality\naccreditation for only commercial reasons\nfrom those who valued the quality\nmanagement system. Please note that in the\nUK the common business usage is\n\u2019\u2019possessing a quality certificate\u2019\u2019 rather than\n\u2019\u2019being quality registered\u2019\u2019 , so this is the\nterminology used in the questionnaire.\nA small pilot study was conducted to check\nthat respondents understood this pivotal\nquestion and were giving appropriate\nresponses to the other questions. The\nquestionnaire was tested on senior managers\nfrom three different industries, with a\nresearcher interviewing the respondents\nafterwards to ascertain whether the questions\nwere understood and that the answers given\nin the questionnaire reflected the broader\ninterview discussion of the variables. The\npilot testing suggested that all the respondents\nunderstood the questions and were giving\nanswers consistent with the objective.\n4\nDoes ISO 9000 accreditation make a profound difference?\nGavin Dick, Kevin Gallimore and Jane C. Brown\nManaging Service Quality\nVolume 12 . Number 1 . 2002 . 30\u00b142\nDerived from the literature we argue that,\nin the absence of higher ratings for QCert\nvalue, the quality measurement emphasis will\nbe dictated by the process structure of the\nservice firm. This is illustrated in Table II\nwhere it can be seen that service firms with\nlow QCert values in back-room dominated\nindustries will have a primary emphasis on\nconformance quality measurement and a\nlesser (secondary) emphasis on the\nexpectation-gap quality measurement. In\ncontrast, service firms in front-room\ndominated industries that have low QCert\nvalues will place much more emphasis on\nexpectation-gap quality than conformance\nquality.\nTo analyse whether service firms that\npursue quality accreditation have a different\nemphasis on quality measurement compared\nto non-certified firms, we put forward the\nfollowing propositions. First, the emphasis on\nquality measurement will be greater in firms\nwith higher QCert values. Second, the\nstandardised approach to quality\nmanagement required for quality\naccreditation is likely to result in firms having\na more balanced emphasis between internal\nand customer measurements of quality. This\nis illustrated in Table II, where it can be seen\nthat firms with high QCert values will have\nthe greatest increase in quality measurement\nemphasis on the quality dimension that has a\nsecondary emphasis in firms with low QCert\nvalues.\nThe effect of these two propositions will be\nthat when the QCert value increases, the\nemphasis on conformance measurement will\nincrease. This increase will be greater in firms\nin front-room dominated service industries as\ntheir process structure suggests they would\nnormally place less emphasis on this\nmeasurement. In addition, when QCert value\nincreases, the emphasis on the expectation-\ngap quality measurements will increase. This\nincrease will be greater in back-room\ndominant service industries. Because of the\ndominance of the customer-centred view of\nquality in services, we predict that the\nincreases in the expectation-gap measurement\nwill be of a lower order than those of\nconformance quality measurement.\nAn example of a large increase in quality\nmeasurement emphasis on conformance\nquality in a front-room dominated\norganisation that has accredited to an ISO\n9000 standard would be a hotel chain. An\nillustration of an increase in conformance\nmeasurement would be a change in\nmeasurement of room quality from informal\nlocal checks by supervisors and a reliance on\ncustomer complaints, to the introduction of\nsystematic daily measurement of room quality\nagainst formal quality standards, with weekly\nquality control statistics being reported and\nreviewed by management, and compliance to\nthe standards and system being checked by\nregular audits by regional\/head quarters staff.\nAn example of a significant increase in\nquality measurement emphasis on\nexpectation-gap quality in a back-room\ndominated organisation that has accredited to\nan ISO 9000 standard would be a television\nbroadcast company. An illustration of an\nincrease in expectation-gap measurement\nwould be change in the measurement of\nadvertisers\u2019 satisfaction with broadcast\nquality, scheduling errors and side-by-side\ncontent (inappropriate products advertised\nbefore and after) from advertisers\u2019 complaints\nand indirect feedback from advertising\nagencies, to a systematic daily telephone\nsurvey of customer satisfaction, with weekly\nadvertisers\u2019 satisfaction measurement\nstatistics being reported and reviewed by\nmanagement.\nBased on the above, we define the following\nhypotheses for testing:\nH1. Where firms have lower QCert values,\nconformance quality measurement\nusage will be greater in firms in back-\nroom dominated industries than in\nfront-room dominated industries (i.e.\nin line with their process structure).\nH2. QCert value will be most strongly\ncorrelated with increases in the\nmeasurement of conformance quality\nin service industries with a front-room\ndominance (because the emphasis on\nTable II Hypothesised quality measurement usage in front- and\nback-room dominant service sectors\nFront-room dominant\nusage\nBack-room\ndominant usage\nConformance\nLow QCert value Secondarya Primary\nHigh QCert value Large increase Small increase\nExpectation gap\nLow QCert value Primarya Secondary\nHigh QCert value Small increase Large increase\nNote: aThe difference between primary and secondary emphasis is\nexpected to be large\n45\nDoes ISO 9000 accreditation make a profound difference?\nGavin Dick, Kevin Gallimore and Jane C.

QCert value will be most strongly\ncorrelated with increases in the\nimportance of expectation-gap quality\nmeasurement in service industries with\na back-room dominance (because the\nemphasis on expectation-gap quality\nmeasurement was lower before, a\nhigher increase will be found).\nMethodology\nThe research data were obtained by a\nquestionnaire survey of the UK\u2019s largest\nservice companies. An examination of\nindustrial classification of the UK\u2019s 1,000\nlargest companies by capital employed\nallowed us to identify a sample of 270 service\norganisations that gave nearly equal numbers\nof firms in each service industry sector. In\npractice this meant that in some smaller\nservice sectors, e.g. insurance, all the firms\nwere surveyed, while in sectors that had a\nlarge number of firms, e.g. stores, the\norganisations were selected to ensure that\nthere was no bias towards larger or smaller\nsize of firm.\nTo avoid any respondent\u2019 s functional bias\nthe cover letter requested completion of the\nquestionnaire by the chief executive. Three\nreasons determined this decision. First, chief\nexecutives are more likely to provide objective\nresponses because they are free from the\nfunctional bias of quality professionals.\nSecond, the chief executive\u2019 s views on quality\naccreditation and quality are likely to pervade\nthe organisation. Finally, Hambrick (1981)\nstrongly advises the use of only the CEO,\nshould the researcher have no option but to\naccess only a unique respondent. The\nquestionnaire was addressed by name to the\nchief executive of each organisation surveyed.\nAn analysis of the returns suggests that the\nvast majority of the questionnaires were\nactually completed by the named individuals.\nMany returns were either signed by the chief\nexecutive or had accompanying compliment\nslips, the latter often containing a handwritten\nnote. In only a few returns was there any\nevidence that the questionnaire had been\npassed onto quality managers\/directors or\ncompany secretaries.\nResponses were received from 105 of the\n270 surveyed. However, only 93 were\ncomplete, giving us a usable response rate of\n34 per cent. Comparing the returns from the\n13 service industry sectors against the sample\nframe showed that the response profile was\nrepresentative of the sample frame (0.8\nSpearman\u2019 s Rho). Detail of the survey returns\nby service sector and staff employed can be\nfound in Table III.\nThe degree of front- versus back-room\nactivity was determined by asking\nrespondents to choose the proportion of\npersonnel involved in direct customer contact\nfrom a list of 10 per cent, 30 per cent,\n50 per cent, 70 per cent, or 90 per cent. This\nwas then used to classify the firms\u2019 industrial\nsectors, as front-room dominant if 50 per cent\nor more of personnel were involved in direct\ncustomer contact, or back-room dominant if\nthe percentage was 30 per cent or less. To\ncheck the content validity of this classification\nof industrial sectors, an expert panel of seven\nmanagement academics drawn from five UK\nbusiness schools was asked to classify these\nservice sectors as having a front- or back-\nroom bias. The results mirrored the direct\ncustomer contact scale split of all industrial\nsectors surveyed except transport services.\nHowever, there was only partial agreement on\nthe media and stores sectors. Overall,\nsufficient agreement exists to have confidence\nthat the classification system, although crude,\nis valid.\nWe note that with only 93 cases to analyse\nwe do not have sufficient power to find\nTable III Survey returns by service sector, back-room\/front-room\nclassification and staff employed\nStaff employed (1000\u2019s)\nService sector Returns < 4 4 to 17 18 to 50\nCommunications 3 1 2\nElectricity 13 2 11\nMedia 11 7 1 3\nTransport services 15 4 4 7\nDistribution 4 3 1\nWater 5 2 3\nBack-room dominant total 51 19 20 12\nBusiness services 4 3 1\nCommodities 4 4\nFood retail and wholesale 13 3 2 8\nHotels and leisure 6 2 4\nInsurance 3 1 2\nMiscellaneous services 1 1\nStores 11 2 9\nFront-room dominant total 42 12 9 21\nOverall total 93 31 29 32\n46\nDoes ISO 9000 accreditation make a profound difference?\nGavin Dick, Kevin Gallimore and Jane C.

However, our earlier research\n(Dick et al., 2001) that examined 206\nmanufacturing and service cases suggested\nthat sufficiently strong relationships between\nquality accreditation and the quality\nmeasurement variables were likely to be found\nin a smaller sample of service cases.\nTo allow the reliability of the results to be\nchecked, correspondents were asked to\nanswer two sets of questions relating to\nquality measurement, one that rated the\nimportance of each quality measurement on a\nfour-point Likert-type scale, ranging from\n\u2019\u2019 important\u2019\u2019 to \u2019\u2019unimportant\u2019\u2019 , while the\nother asked respondents to report their usage\nof the quality measurement. A listing of\nquestionnaire items and their variable labels\ncan be found in the Appendix.\nSince we do not expect the chief executives\nof these large firms to have a grasp of the\ndetail of these quality measurements, the\nquestionnaire items simply ask whether\nfailure rates in meeting conformance and\nexpectation-gap quality are measured, and\ntheir rating of the importance of these\nmeasurements. The logic of the questions\u2019\nwording is that if the quality failure rate is\nreported there must be systematic\nmeasurement of the quality variable.\nFindings\nH1. Where firms have lower QCert values,\nconformance quality measurement usage\nwill be greater in firms in back-room\ndominated industries than in front-room\ndominated industries (i.e. in line with\ntheir process structure).\nThis is supported, for firms that have a lower\nQCert value, if conformance quality usage is\ngreater in service firms with a back-room\ndominance than in those with a front-room\ndominance, with a significant t-test value.\nLower QCert value is defined by firms scoring\non the two points at the unimportant end of\nthe scale.\nThe findings summarised in Table IV\nindicate that firms with a low QCert value in\nback-room dominant sectors do use\nconformance quality measurement much\nmore frequently (0.71) than front-room\ndominant services (0.43). Our calculations\nshow that the difference is statistically\nsignificant (t-test value = \u00ad2.062, p = 0.045).\nWe note that the difference on the\nexpectation-gap quality measurement usage\nfor both front-room (0.61) and back-room\n(0.71) dominant firms with low QCert value\nis much smaller and is not statistically\nsignificant (t-test value = 0.785, p = 0.43).\nThis suggests that firms with lower QCert\nvalues, usage of expectation-gap quality\nmeasurement is broadly similar regardless of\ntheir back-room\/front-room sector split. In\ncontrast, the back-room dominant service\nsectors show a substantially greater usage of\nconformance quality measurement than\nfront-room dominant sectors. The results\nprovide support for the hypothesis, but we\nnote that process structure does not seem to\ndetermine the strength of usage of the\nexpectation-gap measure.\nH2. QCert value will be most strongly\ncorrelated with increases in the\nmeasurement of conformance quality\nin service industries with a front-room\ndominance (because the emphasis on\nconformance quality measurement was\nlower before, a higher increase will be\nfound).\nThis is supported if a significant positive\ncorrelation exists between conformance\nquality measurement and QCert value. The\ncorrelation analysis used was Spearman\u2019s Rho\nwith single-tail significance testing. The\nreliability of the result is tested by checking\nfor consistency with an increased usage of the\nconformance quality measure.\nTable IV Quality measurement usage scores\nFront-room\ndominant\nusage\nBack-room\ndominant\nusage\nt-value front-\nvs back-room\nNumber of cases 42 51\nConformance\nLow QCert value 0.43 0.71 2.062*\nHigh QCert value 0.78 0.74 0.297\nPer cent increase +81 +4\nt-value 2.348* 0.194\nExpectations gap\nLow QCert value 0.61 0.71 0.785\nHigh QCert value 0.83 0.96 1.228\nPer cent increase +36 +35\nt-value 1.630 2.492\nNotes: t-test two-tail significance: * < 0.05.\nThe usage is the mean score for the quality measures.

Number 1 . 2002 . 30\u00b142\nThe analysis, which is summarised in\nTable V, shows front-room dominant firms\n(front-room dominant correlations are above\nthe shaded diagonal) have a correlation of\n0.402 between the conformance quality\nvariable and QCert value (p = 0.004). The\nresults indicate that, in those firms with a\nfront-room dominance, the relationship\nbetween the emphasis on conformance\nquality measurement and QCert value is\nsignificant and strong. Examination of Table\nIV confirms the reliability of these findings,\nthe front-room dominant column shows that\nthe mean usage of conformance quality\nmeasurement in low QCert value firms is 0.43\ncompared to 0.78 in high QCert value firms \u00ad\nan increase of 81 per cent. The t-test for the\nconformance means differ significantly (t-test\nvalue = 2.348, p = 0.024).\nIn these front-room dominant firms, that\nhave higher QCert values, the emphasis on\nconformance quality measurement is greatly\nincreased. The results provide support for the\nhypothesis.\nH3. QCert value will be most strongly\ncorrelated with increases in the\nimportance of expectation-gap quality\nmeasurements in service industries\nwith a back-room dominance (because\nthe emphasis on expectation-gap\nquality measurement was lower before,\na higher increase will be found).\nThis is supported if a significant positive\ncorrelation exists between the quality\nmeasurements expectation gap and QCert\nvalue. The reliability of the result is tested by\nchecking for consistency with an increased\nusage of the expectation gap quality measure.\nThe findings in Table V (back-room\ndominant correlations are below the bold\ndiagonal) show a correlation of 0.269 between\nthe expectation-gap quality variable and\nQCert value for back-room dominant firms\nthat is statistically significant (p = 0.028). The\nresults indicate that the relationship between\nemphasis on expectation-gap quality\nmeasurement and QCert value is positive and\nsignificant in firms with a back-room\ndominance. Examination of the back-room\ndominant column of Table IV shows that the\nt-test for the usage means of expectation-gap\nquality measurement differ significantly (t-test\nvalue = 2.492, p = 0.017) between the low\nQCert value (0.71) and high QCert value\ngroups (0.96), an increase in usage of\n35 per cent. This result confirms reliability for\nthe correlation found.\nIn these back-room dominant firms, that\nhave higher QCert values, the emphasis on\nthe measurement of expectation-gap quality is\nincreased. The results provide support for the\nhypothesis.\nDiscussion\nThe findings indicate that in the absence of\nquality accreditation the process structure of\nthe service firms explains the level of usage of\nconformance quality measurement (the\nservice\u2019 s own measurement of a product\u2019 s\nconformance to specification or criteria).\nService firms, in industries with a front-room\ndominance, used conformance measurement\nmuch less than service firms with a back-room\ndominance.\nWe suggest several reasons. First, the front-\nroom dominance implies that there will be\ngreater customisation of the service product\n(Schemmener, 1986). This variety makes the\nexact specification of what is required of the\nservice more difficult (Lovelock, 1984; Morris\nand Johnson, 1987). Second, often the\ncustomer knows when to intervene if the\nservice is unsatisfactory but has difficulty in\nspecifying what they want in the first instance\n(Kellogg et al., 1997). This leads to a focus on\nthe quality of the service encounter and\ngreater customer tolerance of product quality\nfailure as long as there is effective recovery\n(Hart et al., 1990). Third, checking\nconformance to specification can be\nproblematic; often only the front-line service\nprovider has full information on the\nspecification, making systematic quality\nmeasurement difficult.\nIn contrast to the different usage of\nconformance quality measurement the\nanalysis showed that, in firms that did not\nvalue quality accreditation, the\nexpectation-gap quality measure (the\nTable V Correlation of QCert value with quality measurement emphasis\n(front-room dominant firms\u2019 correlations are above the bold diagonal and\nback-room firms\u2019 below the diagonal)\nQuality variable QCert value Conformance Expectation gap\nQCert value 1.00 0.402** 0.262*\nConformance 0.102 1.00 0.189\nExpectation gap 0.269* 0.323* 1.00\nNote: Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient is significant at the:\n0.01 level **; 0.05 level *; single tailed\n48\nDoes ISO 9000 accreditation make a profound difference?\nGavin Dick, Kevin Gallimore and Jane C.

Number 1 . 2002 . 30\u00b142\ncustomer\u2019 s measurement of service received)\nhad broadly similar levels of usage in both\nfront-room and back-room dominant firms. If\nanything, it seems that back-room dominant\nindustries use the expectation-gap measures\nmore than front-room dominant industries. A\nplausible explanation is that back-room\ndominant firms need to use customer\nfeedback measures more because of the need\nto check continually that conformance\nspecifications are in line with customer\nexpectations. While in contrast, front-room\ndominant firms are more reliant on individual\ncustomer complaint and service recovery\ninstead of customer feedback measures.\nThe findings show that firms with high\nQCert values have a greater emphasis on\nquality measurement than firms with low\nQCert values. Back-room dominant firms\nshowed the largest increase in their quality\nemphasis on the expectation-gap quality\nmeasurement while front-room dominant\nfirms showed the largest increase in emphasis\non the conformance quality measurement.\nIt is worth reflecting here on the different\nimplications of the ISO 9001: 2000 quality\nstandards compared with the SERVQUAL\nmodel that dominates the service literature.\nThe SERVQUAL quality questionnaire\n(Parasuraman et al., 1988, 1991) measures\nthe gap between customers\u2019 expectations and\ntheir views of the actual quality experienced.\nSERVQUAL thus allows insight into\ncustomers\u2019 expectations and the gap in actual\nquality performance to be known. However,\nat best it provides only generic information on\nthis quality gap. On the other hand, an ISO\nquality management system requires that\ncustomers\u2019 expectations are documented as\nspecifications, methods of measurement are\ndefined, and the service process is monitored\nand controlled to ensure that services\nconform to these specifications. ISO quality\nmanagement system standards thus start with\nthe need to define what customers\u2019\nexpectations are before moving on to the\npracticalities of how they may be measured\nand controlled so that actual quality meets\nspecified customers expectations. However,\nthere will be occasions when customers\u2019\nactual expectations vary from what service\nproviders believe are the customers\u2019\nspecifications, leading to conforming quality\nbeing unsatisfactory from the customer\u2019 s\nviewpoint. Therefore, measuring the\ncustomer\u2019 s satisfaction with the quality of the\nservice result is essential and is a central\nprinciple in the ISO 9001:2000 standard.\nCustomer-based measurement allows the gap\nbetween the provider\u2019 s view of the\nspecification and the customer\u2019 s to be\nanalysed and thus differs from the\n\u2019\u2019expectation versus actual quality\u2019\u2019 gap that is\nmeasured with the SERVQUAL\nquestionnaire.\nWe have found evidence that service firms\nembracing ISO 9000 standards do have the\nbalanced quality measurement perspective\nsuggested by the standard, since we have\nfound similar levels of usage of conformance\n(internal) and expectations-gap (customer)\nmeasurements of quality in firms that value\nquality accreditation. It is significant that their\nemphasis shifts from one that is in line with\ntheir process structure to a more balanced\none, where both conformance and\nexpectation-gap quality measurements receive\nsimilar attention.\nIn summary, ISO 9001:2000 standards are\nabout systems to achieve good quality while\nSERVQUAL is limited to only customer-\nbased measurements of quality.\nISO 9001:2000 standards therefore tend to\nhave a strong internal quality emphasis as well\nas a customer-based one, while SERVQUAL\nis customer orientated and does not consider\ninternal processes at all. There is a body of\nservice research that does consider \u2019\u2019 internal\nquality\u2019\u2019 (Schneider and Bowen, 1993;\nReynoso and Moores 1995; Gremler et al.,\n1994). This \u2019\u2019 internal quality\u2019\u2019 relates to the\nquality experienced by internal employees\nfrom internal service providers using\nvariations of the SERVQUAL model of\nquality, but, like SERVQUAL, its focus is on\nmeasuring quality shortfalls, not on the\npracticalities of how process quality may be\nmeasured and controlled so that actual\nquality meets specified customer\u2019 s\nexpectations. Thus a service firm with a\nquality system certified to an ISO 9000\nstandard could use SERVQUAL as a\nmeasurement instrument for customer\nquality, but it would measure internal quality\nagainst specific quality attributes that reflect\neither the firm\u2019s understanding of a particular\ncustomer specification or more generic\ncriteria that specify good practice.\nClearly, in this research, the service firms\nwhich consider quality accreditation\nimportant stand out as having a different\noutlook on quality measurement. Although\n49\nDoes ISO 9000 accreditation make a profound difference?\nGavin Dick, Kevin Gallimore and Jane C. Brown\nManaging Service Quality\nVolume 12 . Number 1 . 2002 . 30\u00b142\ncausality cannot be implied from the\nstatistics, the findings taken as a whole\nsuggest that it is quality accreditation that has\nbrought about the change because we have\nobserved a change of quality measurement\nusage and emphasis that is counter to that\nsuggested by the process structure of the\nindustry. Therefore, we conclude that the\nreason for this similarity of quality\nmeasurement emphasis, regardless of the\nfirm\u2019s process structure, is the accreditation to\nan ISO 9000 standard, in particular the\nsystematic approach to quality measurement\nthat they dictate.\nConclusions\nIn this research, firms have been analysed by\ntheir rating of the importance of quality\naccreditation in contributing to their\ndefinition of quality rather than by their\naccreditation to an ISO 9000 standard. This\nQCert value has been found to be a significant\nvariable. The variable is more a direct\nmeasure of a firm\u2019s view of quality\naccreditation than those used previously\nwhich have considered the firm\u2019s motives for\nregistration (Jones et al., 1997; Singles et al.,\n2001). Although it has proven to be a\nsignificant variable, the limitation of a direct\nvariable such as the one used here is that it\nprovides no explanation for why firms\nconsider quality accreditation important or\nnot.\nWe have found, as predicted, that firms that\ndo not consider ISO 9000 registration\nimportant have a quality measurement usage\nthat reflects the process structure of the\nservice firm. Service industry sectors where a\nmajority of staff (70 per cent or more) have no\ncustomer contact are likely to have large de-\ncoupled back-room operations. These we\nhave classified as back-room dominant. In\nthese service sectors, we have found that there\nis substantial usage of internal quality\nmeasurement (conformance) in addition to a\nusage of customer-based quality\nmeasurement (expectation gap). In contrast,\nservice sectors that have a majority of staff (50\nper cent or more) with direct customer\ncontact that we have classified as front-room\ndominant are likely to have fewer staff\nworking in de-coupled back-room operations\nand in these service sectors we have found\nthat there is much higher usage of customer-\nbased quality measurement (expectation gap)\nthan internal quality measurement\n(conformance).\nIt was found that the service firms that\nconsider quality accreditation to be\nimportant, have a different emphasis on\nquality than other service firms do. The\nsurvey found that these firms have an\nincreased usage and emphasis on both the\ninternal (conformance) and customer-based\n(expectation-gap) quality measures.\nHowever, the greatest difference in emphasis\nis found on the quality measure that is not\nfavoured due to the firm\u2019s dominant process\nstructure. Firms in back-room dominant\nservice industry sectors increase their usage of\ncustomer-based quality measures by\n35 per cent (expectation-gap measure usage),\nwhile front-room dominant sectors increased\ntheir usage of internal quality measures by\n81 per cent (conformance measure usage). It\nis significant that their emphasis shifts from\none that is in line with their process structure\nto a more balanced one, where both internal\nand customer-based quality measures receive\nsimilar attention. This leads us to believe that\naccreditation to ISO 9000 makes a profound\ndifference to the way quality is perceived and\nmeasured in service firms.\nAs discussed in the methodology, the\nresults must be considered in the light of the\nlimitations of our survey. First, our\nrespondents were chief executives, so we are\nrelying on their views of quality emphasis in\norganisations that employ large numbers of\npeople (the majority of firms employed over\n5,000 full-time staff). A larger number of\nrespondents per organisation would have\nenhanced reliability and the power of the\ntests. Second, we acknowledge that the\nquality measurement constructs we use may\nbe confusing for those who are more familiar\nwith the SERVQUAL definitions that\ndominate the service quality literature, but\nclearly the nature of this research dictates that\nwe must use terms and definitions that relate\nto the way in which quality is conceptualised\nin the ISO 9001:2000 standards.\nWe also acknowledge that the method we use\nto categorise firms into front-room dominant or\nback-room dominant is crude, and its logic is\nbeing undermined by technological changes.\nIndeed, front-room and back-room as terms to\ndescribe the process structure of service firms is\nbecoming increasingly inappropriate.\nInformation technology is changing the\n0\nDoes ISO 9000 accreditation make a profound difference?\nGavin Dick, Kevin Gallimore and Jane C. Brown\nManaging Service Quality\nVolume 12 . Number 1 . 2002 . 30\u00b142\nmethods of managing the customer interface.\nBy doing so it is moving, and blurring, the\nboundaries of the conventional front-\/back-\nroom model of process structure. Technology\ncan allow front room activities that do not need\nthe physical presence of the customer to be co-\nlocated with back-room activities and hence\ncentralised. At its extreme (i.e. Internet\nshopping), the front room becomes a virtual\none with no contact between the customer and\nthe firm\u2019s staff, all interaction and transactions\nbeing through the computer system. In these\ncircumstances there is no physical front room at\nall. However, there is still a sphere of activity\nwhere the customer interaction takes place.\nClearly, the terms front room and back room\nare outmoded and there is a need for new\nclassifications and definitions that capture the\nvaried process structures of today\u2019 s service\nsystems. Therefore, we advocate that future\nresearch needs to be enriched by more\nsophisticated methods that capture the changed\nprocess structures that technology has brought\nabout. Central to this is the impact of the\nchange from direct to indirect server contact\nwith the customer and how this changes quality\nemphasis and management.\nGeneralisation from the survey findings\nshould be tempered by consideration of\nfactors specific to large firms. The\nMcDonaldization effect (Ritzer, 1995), and\nhence greater usage of internal quality\nmeasurement, is likely to be strongest in the\nlargest service firms as these operate in mass\nmarkets. This suggests that we can generalise\nfor other large service firms but not for\nsmaller service enterprises.\nTo conclude, we have found that service\nfirms that consider accreditation to an\nISO 9000 quality standard as important to\ntheir definition of quality place much more\nemphasis on quality measurement than other\nservice firms do. It is significant that their\nquality measurement emphasis shifts from\none that is in line with their process structure\nto a more balanced one, where both internal\nand customer-based quality measurements\nreceive similar attention.\nReferences\nBeaumont, N.B., Sohal, A.S. and Terziovski, M.
