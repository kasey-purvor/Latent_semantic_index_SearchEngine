They\nare characterised by the expression of both stromal and\nhaematopoietic markers. In particular they produce extracellular\nmatrix molecules including collagen types I and III and\nfibronectin, while also expressing CD45 and CD34, and can be\ndistinguished from monocytes, macrophages and fibroblasts\nthrough a combination of markers [3].\nIt has been suggested that fibrocytes can act as antigen-\npresenting cells, responding to TLR ligands [4] and inducing\nsignificant T cell proliferation due to the expression of MHC class\nII and CD86 [5]. However, the primary role of fibrocytes appears\nto be very similar to local tissue fibroblasts, in providing\nextracellular matrix deposition during tissue repair, and both cell\npopulations can be isolated from wound chambers [6]. Impor-\ntantly there is also strong evidence that fibrocytes contribute to\npathological fibrosis in a number of tissues, particularly the lung\nand kidney [7,8]. Spindle-shaped cells accumulate during\nbleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis where they express both\nCD45 and collagen I. Fibrosis can be enhanced in this model by\nintravenous injection of in vitro-generated fibrocytes, with the cells\nrecruited to the lungs via their expression of CXCR4 [9]. By\ncontrast, for FITC-induced pulmonary fibrosis, fibrocytes use the\nCCR2-CCL12 axis for their recruitment [10]. Once fibrocytes\nhave been recruited and\/or differentiated in the repairing\/fibrotic\ntissues they may further differentiate towards a myofibroblast\nphenotype with the expression of a-smooth muscle actin [9,11];\nthe precise contribution of fibrocytes to the myofibroblast\npopulation may vary depending on the tissue and context.\nRecently fibrocytes have also been shown to promote healing\nduring colonic inflammation [12].\nFibrocytes can differentiate in vitro from either peripheral blood\nmononuclear cells or purified CD14+ monocytes. Thus fibrocytes\nrepresent one of a number of cell types that can differentiate from\nmonocytes, including macrophages, osteoclasts and dendritic cells\n[13]. In the presence of serum, fibrocytes require up to 2 weeks to\ndifferentiate [6], whereas in the absence of serum this process is\naccelerated, with cells appearing in culture after only a few days\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 3 | e9730\n[14], Interestingly the differentiation of fibrocytes is inhibited by\nserum amyloid P (SAP), a major constituent of serum [14], and\nbleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis can be inhibited by SAP\n[15]. A number of other molecules can influence the differenti-\nation of fibrocytes in vitro, and presumably in vivo. TGFb1, IL-4 and\nIL-13 all promote fibrocyte differentiation, with IL-12 and IFNc\nbeing inhibitory [16,17]. It is currently assumed that fibrocytes\nthat differentiate in the presence or absence of serum reflect the\nsame cell type, differing only in their kinetics of generation. In this\nstudy we have addressed this issue by studying the phenotype,\ngrowth and differentiation characteristics, response to serum and\ntranscriptome of fibrocytes generated under both serum-free (SF)\nand serum-containing (SC) conditions. Our data show that these\ntwo types of fibrocytes, while closely related, are nevertheless\ndistinct, suggesting that they may play different roles during the\nresponse to wounding.\nResults\nFibrocytes were generated by culture of PBMC or CD14+\nmonocytes (purity .98%) in either SF or SC medium (20% heat-\ninactivated FCS), as previously described in the literature [6,14].\nFor both culture conditions, after a few days elongated cells with a\nfibrocyte morphology began to appear (Fig. 1A,B). In SF\nconditions the fibrocytes appeared after only 4 days and reached\na peak at 6 days, whereas in the presence of serum differentiation\nrequired a longer period of culture and did not peak until day 12,\nas previously described [6,14]. Interestingly, more SF than SC\nFigure 1. Differential generation of fibrocytes in serum-free or serum-containing conditions, from PBMC and CD14+ monocytes.\nFibrocytes were generated from PBMC (filled circles) or purified CD14+ monocytes (open circles) in either serum-free (SF) or serum-containing (SC;\n20% HIFCS).

The loss of SC fibrocyte\nnumbers at d5\u20137 did not occur in all experiments (Fig. S1), and\nappears to be related to the washing step performed at d4.\nSF and SC fibrocytes both expressed haematopoietic markers\nand stromal markers. The stromal markers fibronectin, collagen I\nand vimentin were expressed by both SF and SC fibrocytes, as well\nas fibroblasts, but were not expressed by macrophages generated\nin parallel from the same preparations, except for vimentin which\nshowed a similar degree of expression on macrophages (Fig. 2A).\nThere was also a lower level of expression for collagen III on\nfibrocytes. The haematopoietic markers CD45 and CD68 were\nexpressed by both types of fibrocyte, as well as macrophages, but\nwere virtually negative on fibroblasts. The few cells that appear to\nexpress CD45 are also present with the isotype control. CD13 and\nCD3 were positive and negative for all cell populations,\nrespectively (Fig. 2B).\nThe differences in the generation of fibrocytes under SF and SC\nconditions (Fig. 1) suggested that these cells may respond\ndifferently to the presence of serum within the culture medium.\nTo investigate the effects of serum on SF fibrocytes we initiated the\nculture of PBMC in serum-free conditions, and then at either day\n4, 8, 11 or 14 replaced the SF medium for SC medium. The\nnumber of cells with fibrocyte morphology was assessed until day\n18 of the culture. Irrespective of the day at which the serum-\ncontaining medium was added there was a loss of cells with a\nfibrocyte morphology, within 120 min, which persisted for the\nlength of the culture (Fig. 3A,B). Although there was a large,\nstatistically significant, effect of the addition of serum (Fig. 3D),\nwhen the reciprocal experiment was performed there was little\neffect of the change of medium on SC fibrocytes (Fig. 3C,D).\nIdentical results were obtained when cultures were generated from\nCD14+ monocytes (Fig. S1). The effect was found for a variety of\ndifferent sera, and was not due to the use of RPMI or DMEM\nculture media (Fig. S2); plasma can also be substituted for serum\n(data not shown). The expression of both stromal and haemato-\npoietic markers was maintained when SF fibrocytes were switched\ninto SC conditions (Fig. S3), suggesting that the cells were still\nfibrocytes but had lost their distinct morphology.\nThe above data suggested that there were both shared and\ndistinct features of SF and SC fibrocytes. We wished to look more\nclosely at the relationship between these two types of fibrocyte, as\nwell as other monocyte-derived progeny and fibroblasts. cDNA\nmicroarrays were performed for each cell population from three\ndifferent individual donors, each in technical triplicate. The data\nfrom SF and SC fibrocytes, CD14+ monocytes, immature and\nmature dendritic cells (DC), osteoclasts, macrophages and\nfibroblasts were analysed using significance analysis of microarrays\n(SAM) with a 0.1% false discovery rate, and the resultant gene lists\nwere used for principal component analysis (PCA). When all cell\npopulations were included the SAM identified 24452 significantly\ndifferent genes (Table S1), and the PCA showed that the\nfibroblasts formed a distinct cluster away from the other\npopulations (Fig. 4A). Removal of the fibroblasts from the analysis\nproduced a SAM list of 21526 genes (Table S2) and the PCA\nbegan to show a distinction between the monocyte-derived\nprogeny (Fig. 4B). In particular the macrophages, SF fibrocytes,\nmonocytes and mature DC formed distinct clusters. Reducing the\nanalysis to just the macrophages, SF and SC fibrocytes generated a\nlist of 3543 genes (Table S3), and the PCA clearly showed three\ndistinct clusters (Fig. 4C). When just the two types of fibrocyte\nwere analysed the SAM list contained 5144 genes (Table S4), and\nthe two cell populations were clearly separated along the first\nprincipal component (Fig. 4D). There was always a group of 3 SF\nfibrocytes that clustered away from the other populations, but still\nclosest to the other SF fibrocytes, and these were triplicates from a\nsingle donor. The SAM gene list from the paired 2-way fibrocyte\nanalysis was used to generate a dendrogram, clustered for both\ntype samples and genes. This showed multiple gene clusters that\nwere responsible for the separation of the two types of fibrocyte,\nwith both up and down-regulated genes for each type of fibrocyte.\nA gene pathway analysis (DAVID) was performed on those genes\nfrom the SAM list between the two types of fibrocyte (Table 1;\nBenjamini p,0.001, .2-fold enrichment). The most significant\ngene pathways that distinguish SF and SC fibrocytes include the\nimmune and inflammatory response, chemotaxis, RNA processing\nand lipid metabolism pathways. Genes common to many of the\npathways that were up-regulated in SC fibrocytes included TLR4,\nIL-1b, and the chemokines CCL2, 3, 7 and 22, and the C5a\ncomplement receptor. A complete list of the significant DAVID\npathways is also provided (Table S5).\nDiscussion\nIt is now well established that fibrocytes are bone-marrow\nderived cells, expressing both haematopoietic and stromal cell\nmarkers, that play key roles in tissue repair, angiogenesis and\npathological fibrosis [1,2,8]. However, two methods have been\ndescribed in the literature for the in vitro generation of fibrocytes\nfrom peripheral blood mononuclear cells; the major difference in\nculture medium is the presence [6] or absence [14] of serum.\nGiven the changes in serum protein concentrations that occur\nduring tissue repair, inflammation and its resolution, understand-\ning the effects of serum on the differentiation and function of\nfibrocytes is of critical importance. In this study we have compared\nthe growth, phenotype, transcriptome and response to serum of\nfibrocytes generated under SF and SC conditions. Our data\nindicate that although both cells can be described as fibrocytes\nthey have distinct properties that may relate to their proposed roles\nin vivo.\nThe current definition of a fibrocyte is a spindle-shaped cell that\nexpresses both haematopoietic and stromal cell markers. Consis-\ntent with published literature [6,14] both SF and SC fibrocytes\nexpressed CD45 and other haematopoietic markers, as well as\nfibronectin, collagen I and III and vimentin, both with an\nelongated spindle-shaped morphology. Therefore, it is clear that\nthe cells differentiated under both SF and SC conditions can be\nclassified as fibrocytes.\nFibrocytes can differentiate in vitro directly from CD14+\nmonocytes as well as from a more heterogeneous PBMC\npopulation [6,14,16]. We observed a difference in the ability of\nSF and SC fibrocytes to differentiate from PBMC and CD14+\nperipheral blood cells, with more efficient generation of SF from\nPBMC, and SC from CD14+ cells. This raises the possibility that\nthese cells represent two distinct types of fibrocyte that arise from\ndifferent precursor cells, present at different frequencies within the\nPBMC and CD14+ cell populations, or differentially affected by\nthe presence of other leukocyte populations. It was previously\nsuggested that T cells enhance the differentiation of SC fibrocytes\nfrom CD14+ monocytes [16,18], although paradoxically our data\nshowed a more efficient generation of these fibrocytes from\npurified CD14+ cells than PBMC. We also found a number of\nother differences between SF and SC fibrocytes. These included\nthe more rapid differentiation of SF fibrocyte in culture, as\npreviously commented on by Pilling et al [14], and distinct\ntranscriptome profiles. Regardless of the origins of SF and SC\nFibrocyte Differentiation\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 March 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 3 | e9730\nFigure 2. Both serum-free and serum-containing fibrocytes express both haematopoietic and stromal cell markers. Fibrocytes were\ngenerated from PBMC under serum-free (SF) and serum-containing (SC) culture conditions, as well as macrophages.

Immunostaining is shown in red for the stromal markers fibronectin, collagens I and III and\nFibrocyte Differentiation\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 March 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 3 | e9730\nfibrocytes, our data clearly show that the differentiation in the\npresence and absence of serum is not identical. Our analysis of the\nmicroarray data assumed that any differences observed were due\nto the fibrocytes and not contaminating monocyte, or monocyte-\nderived populations. While there is clearly the potential for some\ncontamination we do not believe this to be significant. Although\nthe numbers of fibrocytes in our cultures may appear low\ncompared to the input number, these counts were determined\nby morphology. The expression of fibronectin (Fig. 2) clearly\nshows that the percentage of fibrocytes in the cultures was actually\nvery high, and that many cells that would not have been counted\nas fibrocytes by morphology nonetheless expressed both stromal\nand haematopoietic markers. In addition, our microarray analysis\nincluded both monocytes and monocyte-derived progeny (DC,\nmacrophages and osteoclasts), and yet the fibrocyte populations\nformed distinct clusters upon analysis of the microarray data.\nMonocytes have the potential to differentiate into a number of\ncell lineages, including macrophages, dendritic cells, fibrocytes,\nosteoclasts and adipocytes. SAM analysis of the two types of\nfibrocyte with a number of other monocyte-derived progeny, as\nwell as fibroblasts, revealed that SC fibrocytes were most related\nto macrophages and osteoclasts, with SF fibrocytes forming a\nmore distinct cluster, away from other monocyte-derived\nprogeny, but also from fibroblasts. The gene pathways identified\nby DAVID suggest that the SF and SC fibrocytes differ in a\nnumber of key areas including response to wounding, inflamma-\ntory response and cell migration. Interestingly, a high number of\ngene pathways associated with lipid metabolism were significantly\nenhanced in SC fibrocytes. This is consistent with the ability\nof SC fibrocytes to differentiate to adipocytes [19]. It remains to\nbe determined whether SF fibrocytes retain this degree of\nmultipotency.\nUntil recently the major cell population thought to be\nresponsible for matrix deposition during tissue repair and fibrosis\nwas the fibroblast. These stromal tissue-resident cells are clearly\nimportant players in these processes, with evidence for both their\nproliferation and differentiation towards myofibroblasts [20].\nHowever, recent evidence has implicated fibrocytes in these\nprocesses [1,2]. During the repair of tissues the concentration of\nserum-derived proteins will initially be very high, due to the loss of\ntissue integrity and increased endothelial permeability, and would\nresult in the differentiation of SC fibrocytes. However, as repair\nproceeds concentrations will fall, favouring the differentiation of\nserum-free fibrocytes. Although at any one moment in time all\ninfiltrating monocytes would be exposed to the same concentration\nof serum-derived proteins, this concentration would change during\nthe time-course of the response, and therefore so would the\npotential to differentiate into either SF or SC fibrocytes. It is\npossible that the overall serum concentration may control\ndifferentiation, or that specific factors present in serum, including\nserum amyloid P, may drive this process. Although many features\nwere shared between SF and SC fibrocytes (morphology,\nexpression of matrix proteins), the clear transcriptional differences\nthat we observed suggest that they may fulfil distinct roles within\nthe tissue, and that due to the effects of serum on their\ndifferentiation this would happen at different times during tissue\nrepair and fibrosis. For example, the differentiation of fibrocytes\nfrom monocyte precursors that are constantly recruited to sites of\nchronic inflammation may favour SF fibrocytes due to the\nrelatively low levels of serum protein that will be present, as\ncompared to acute tissue injury. Interestingly, even when SF\nfibrocytes had differentiated, we observed a strong effect of serum\nresulting in the rounding up of these cells. It is possible that this\nprocess might allow these fibrocytes to migrate away from the\ntissue site. We have not been able to identify the component in\nserum responsible for this change of phenotype, although it does\nnot appear to be SAP (data not shown). This is clearly an\nimportant issue for future research, as changes in fibrocyte\nnumbers may either prevent further pathological fibrosis or even\ncontribute to its resolution.\nMaterials and Methods\nEthics statement\nThis study was approved by the Black Country Research Ethics\nCommittee (07\/Q2702\/54) and following informed written\nconsent, all samples were collected and stored according to the\nHuman Tissue Act (U.K.).\nIsolation of PBMC and CD14+ monocytes\nPeripheral blood was taken by venepuncture from healthy\nvolunteer donors into preservative-free heparin. Peripheral blood\nmononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by density-gradient\ncentrifugation using Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare Biosciences,\nAmersham, UK) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and\nwere washed five times with RPMI 1640 to ensure removal of\nplatelets. CD14+ monocytes were isolated by positive selection\nusing magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bisley, UK). PBMC were\nre-suspended at 80 ml per 107cells in PBS, 0.5% bovine serum\nalbumin (Sigma-Aldrich, Irvine, U.K.), 2 mM EDTA, with 20 ml\nof anti-CD14+ beads (Miltenyi Biotec) and incubated at 4uC for\n15 min. Cells were washed twice by centrifugation before isolation\nof the bead-bound cells on a magnetised column.

For macrophage generation, cells were\ncultured at 106\/ml in Iscove\u2019s modified Dulbecco\u2019s medium\n(IMDM; Sigma-Aldrich), 1% GPS, 10% pooled human AB+ male\nserum (Biosera) and 50 ng\/ml M-CSF (Peprotech EC Ltd.,\nLondon, UK). Dendritic cells (DC) were generated from\n2.56106 CD14+ monocytes resuspended in 5 ml RPMI 1640,\n10% pooled human AB+male serum with recombinant human IL-\n4 (500 U\/ml) and GM-CSF (1000 U\/ml; Immunotools, Frie-\nsoythe, Germany) and cultured for 6 days in T25 flasks (Sarstedt,\nLeicester, UK). At day 3, 2 ml medium was removed and 2.5 ml\nfresh medium added. At day 6 immature DC (iDC) were harvested\nby shaking the flask vigorously and collecting non-adherent cells.\nTo produce mature DC (mDC), harvested iDC were cultured for 2\ndays with IL-1b (1 mg\/ml; Peprotech, London, UK), IL-6\n(200 ng\/ml; Immunotools), TNFa (10 ng\/ml; Peprotech) and\nPGE2 (1 mg\/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Osteoclasts were generated from\nPBMC by overnight culture in a minimal essential medium\n(Lonza, Basel, Switzerland), 1% GPS with 10% HI-FCS, followed\nby removal of non-adherent cells and culture in aMEM, 1%GPS,\n10% HI-FCS, with M-CSF (30 ng\/ml; Peprotech) and RANKL\n(25 ng\/ml; Peprotech) for 18 days. Medium was replaced with\nfresh medium every 2 days.\nConfocal immunofluorescence microscopy\nFibrocyte, macrophage and fibroblast cultures were established\nin 8 well chamber slides and taken to day 11, day 7 and 60%\nconfluence, respectively. Medium was removed, the slides washed\nthree times in PBS for 5 min, air dried and fixed in acetone at\n220uC for 15 min. Following rehydration with PBS\/2% BSA for\n5 min, slides were blocked for 20 min with 10% serum (same\nspecies as the secondary antibody used). Following a PBS wash,\nprimary antibodies were added at previously determined optimal\nconcentrations and left overnight in a humidified chamber at 4uC.\nFollowing two washes with PBS, secondary antibodies were added\nand left for one hour. Following two PBS washes, nuclei were\ncounterstained with Hoechst (20 mg\/ml; Bis-benzimid H33258\nFluorochrom, Sigma-Aldrich) and slides mounted in 2.4% 1,4-\nDiazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma-Aldrich) in glycerol, pH 8.6.\nThe slides were stored at 220uC until analysis using a Zeiss\nAxiovert 100M confocal microscope and LSM 5.10 version 3.2\nSP2 software.

For each cell type generated triplicate\nsamples were differentiated from each of 3 different donors, with\nall cell types, except fibroblasts, generated from each donor.\nCultures were harvested on days 11, 7, 8, 18 and 100% confluence\nfor fibrocytes, macrophages, iDC\/mDC, osteoclasts and fibro-\nblasts, respectively. Microarray slides were scanned using a\nScanarray GX+ scanner (Perkin-Elmer, Monza, Italy) and\nanalysed using Scanarray express version 3.03.0002 using variable\nvoltages. A prepared GAL file was used to annotate the slide\nimages and the intensity data was extracted and exported as gpr\nfiles using the same software. These were uploaded into the Gene\nExpression Pattern Analysis Suite (GEPAS) (Bioinformatics Unit\nCNIO; http:\/\/gepas.bioinfo.cnio.es ) software for normalization,\nwhich was performed using print-tip loess normalisation with half\nbackground subtraction, initially within each slide and slide scale\nnormalisation subsequently between slides. Normalised data were\nexported to TIGR Multi-experiment Viewer (TMEV), version 4.0\n(http:\/\/www.tigr.org\/tdb\/euk ) and hierarchical clustering, sig-\nnificance analysis of microarrays (SAM) and principle component\nanalysis (PCA) were performed. Cluster analysis was performed\nusing average linkage clustering on a Euclidean distance metric\nmatrix using the TMEV data analysis package.
