With similar\nunits now in place in other institutions, the production of CAL is taking place at a rapid pace,\noften with the evaluation of the applications disproportionately lagging behind. This inevitably\nraises questions of whether what we are producing is effective CAL, and what approaches should\nbe taken to use the potential of multimedia in a learning environment.\nIntroduction\nModern-day authoring systems have made the production of CAL applications so easy\nthat people with little computer literacy are able quite quickly to create elaborate\nmultimedia applications. The point, however, is that while so many of us have become\nauthors in the past few years, the objective of our creations has been somewhat missed. It\nis all to easy to see visually impressive multimedia CAL, and to convince ourselves that\nthey represent good CAL material. An application may be quickly sanctioned, produced\nand implemented at universities, then attention is focused on to the next project. While\nevaluation is normally costed into a project, various constraints, such as shifting\npersonnel or additional demands on funds, limit the evaluation of the application to\nascertain whether the investment of producing it was worthwhile. The Hypertext Support\nUnit (HSU) at the University of Kent was set up in 1992 to promote the pervasive use of\nhypertext across the campus. In its role as a support unit, it facilitates the development of\nCAL material in all disciplines in close collaboration with the content specialists, i.e. the\nlecturers. The HSU, along with many other units or departments, produce many CAL\napplication paying attention to the aesthetics of interface design, but largely glossing over\nthe learning instructions so vital to good CAL applications in harnessing the potential of\nmultimedia in an educational environment. Too many people put a linear book on-line,\n98\nVolume 3 Number I\ngive it some bookmarks, and call it hypertext; worse yet, they add a few scanned-in\nphotographs and a soundtrack and call it multimedia (Fisher, 1994).\nEffective CAL\nThe view that multimedia would add a new dimension to teaching and learning and\nenhance the learning process, has not yet been realized. This may be in part untrue, due to\nthe lack of documentation and research into the evaluation of current CAL systems and\ntheir impact on learning, but developers have certainly still not tapped into the true\npotential that multimedia has to offer in the scope of knowledge construction. Nelson and\nPalumbo (1992) state that 'simply allowing learners to quickly access a body of\ninformation, even in the learner-controlled, non-linear manner supported by hypermedia\nsystems, does not ensure learning any more than a library does'. There is a case for\narguing that even a very flat, predominantly text-based publication, when put on-line\nover a network, can greatly increase access to the information. It is not to be confused,\nhowever, with an application that is to be used to augment learning. Such systems need to\nuse the cognitive processes of the brain by incorporating learning instruction. These\nsystems cannot merely concern themselves with the elaborate presentation of information\nmaking use of sound, graphics, video or animation, but rather must facilitate the\nassimilation of the information into a knowledge base of content from which inferences as\nto the principles or concepts that are to be learned, may be articulated. Nelson and\nPalumbo (1992) go on to say that 'merely developing knowledge bases for presentation to\nlearners in a hypermedia environment will not be particularly effective unless instruc-\ntional activities are supported by the hypermedia system'.\nLearning theory in CAL\nMost popular authoring systems support at least four inherent cognitive features. These\ncan be classified as: browsing, searching, integrating chunks of information, and angling,\nas mentioned by Duchastel (1990), a process that describes the navigation to the same\nchunk of information via a number of different pathways. Angling can be used to good\neffect in CAL applications to allow a topic to be perused in different ways, each one\nbringing a new perspective to the learner. All of these processes allow the incorporation of\nsome sort of learning instruction in CAL to aid knowledge representation, construction\nand assimilation. Lindsay & Norman (in Dufresne et ai, 1990) describe the definition of\nconcepts as being central to comprehension; through the use of careful organization of\ninformation into defined categories with further subdivisions of related information,\nauthors can build up a linked knowledge base that can be explored by learners and assist\nin the articulation of concepts. The four processes described above are central to\nauthoring principles, and their use ultimately determines the accessibility and flexibility to\nbe found in the CAL application (Khan et al, 1994).\nAuthoring systems are coming in for much criticism for making the incorporation of\nlearning instruction difficult. However, it is probably more a case of a lack of\nunderstanding about the learning theory and the under-use of the true hypertext features\n_\nHassan Khan Effective CAL theory and practice\nof authoring systems. Learning tools that may be constructed in CAL applications are\nadvanced organizers (Ausubel, 1960). These can serve to revise information and concepts\nthat should have been learnt, and also introduce the new information that is to follow.\nAdvance organizers may be extended to offer suggested pathways (Hammond, 1989) that\nguide learners through the information. At the outset of the application, a concept map\nor navigational web can be used to present the learner with an outline of the information\navailable, and to highlight alternate navigational pathways which may be based on\ndifferent levels of comprehension. Concept maps provide learners with a top-level look at\nthe mesh of hypertext information. Halasz et al. (1987) have gone as far as saying that no\nsystem can be described as a true hypertext system unless it has something akin to a\nconcept map. For the purpose of development, however, where current systems do not\nsupport this feature it is normally possible to exploit the interactivity of the authoring\nsystem with other applications. These learning tools provide mechanisms for theme\nhighlighting, restatement, introduction, summary pages and the use of analogies, all of\nwhich promote the understanding of information (Kintsch & Van Dijk, 1978).\nAnother useful learning skill is knowledge construction, the building of new nodes and\nlinks between information that is pertinent to a particular individual: open hypermedia\nsystems such as Microcosm (Hill & Hall, 1994) allow the construction of a personal\nlibrary linkbase of information in a distributed environment. Even World Wide Web,\nthrough the manipulation of the hotlist feature, allows users to create their own\ninformation base.\nThe future of CAL development\nAuthors of CAL must possess a variety of skills, some of which include computing, art\nand graphic design, audio and visual manipulation skills, and some knowledge of learning\ntheory. It is in this capacity that CAL development differs from traditional software\ndevelopment. It is important to grasp the fact that authors of multimedia CAL\napplications cannot ignore the use of these skills during development. An author\npossessing even some of these skills is a vital commodity, yet realistically it is not always\nfair to expect lecturers who have become developers to turn their ideas into effective CAL\napplications. Development of CAL involves an investment of time, money and resources,\nand another factor that is so easily forgotten: the subsequent maintenance of the\napplications. Poorly designed applications are so often required to be completely\nredeveloped when the content has become dated. As I have mentioned, development of\nCAL is increasingly being shifted from isolated departments to centralized development\nunits, which serve as a focal point and repository of development, support and\nmaintenance activities. Yet while it is probable that such entities will possess more of the\nskills required for effective CAL development, additional specific expertise will still be\nrequired. There is no one solution to this problem, but there are several options.\nInstitutions can deliberately try to recruit multi-skilled personnel for development units,\nthough it is improbable that any one person will possess the right mix of skills. Another\npossible approach is to train recruited personnel by allowing them to spend time in\n100\nALT-] Volume 3 Number I\nvarious departments whose expertise would be useful to CAL development. The most\nidealistic approach is the collaboration of development units with relevant departments,\nthough this may be more or less difficult from university to university depending on the\nindividual culture of the institution.\nConclusion\nLearning is a highly individual process, and cannot be standardized. Multimedia allows\ninformation to be constructed so that it may be adapted to various cognitive styles.\nCurrent systems need to be evaluated to assess the benefits of investments involved in\ntheir production and maintenance. Central to the process of development of effective\nCAL is the need for a variety of skills. These skills are often available within a single\ninstitution and should be tapped. The University of Kent has a campus where there exists\na climate of receptiveness to learning technology, and the Hypertext Support Unit has\nbeen able to use the campus-wide co-operation (Khan et al, 1994) in striving to develop\neffective CAL material. But each institution has a particular culture, and where\ncollaboration is not practicable, other ways of accessing the skills required for CAL\ndevelopment must be sought.\nReferences\nAusubel, D.P.
