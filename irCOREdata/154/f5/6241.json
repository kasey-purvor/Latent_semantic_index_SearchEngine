As he points out, taking a purely quantitative approach to the\nevaluation of ICT investments in teaching and learning is wholly inappropriate. However,\nin this transitional period, where ICT applications are new and the effects on operational\nprocesses within higher education institutions are unknown, it is not only qualitative issues\nthat need to be investigated but also the potential changes to the scope and nature of the\ncosts incurred by institutions. While the small-scale, and localized, introduction of ICT in\nteaching might only affect the time and effort of a few individual academics, large-scale\ndeployment of the same methodology may require substantial institutional investment (for\nexample, in network infrastructure, hardware, licenses, support staff). The CBA model\nencourages institutions to consider and record all the cost implications of their strategies,\nnot in an attempt to quantify the outputs (benefits) of these new learning processes but to\nidentify and quantify the inputs to these processes. These quantitative inputs can then be\nevaluated in the context of qualitative outputs.\nDraper argues that the merit of our model lies in 'the value and accuracy of the categories\nor factors . . . [benefits and costs].. . used'. He then notes areas where the model fails to\ntake into account some important factors (for example, staff stress, student time). While\nwe agree the factors chosen for the CBA are critical, we did not intend that users of the\nmodel would merely select from our example list of benefits. Instead, we envisaged that a\ndecision-making group, with representatives of all those with a stake in the CBA, would\ndiscuss and formulate their own benefit types in relation to institutional strategies and\ncontext. A limited set of benefits, those that matter most to the institution, would then be\nused to evaluate the investment options. Similarly, institutions would determine what costs\nto include within the costing framework. Hence Draper's examples of staff stress and\nstudent time could be accommodated. If, as a consequence of an investment, academic\nstaff become unduly stressed then this would show up through some indicator of low-staff\n122\nAu-J Volume 11 Number 3\nsatisfaction if that were one of the benefit categories. Likewise, if student time is an\nimportant consideration, this could be incorporated into the model by including student\ntime or student satisfaction as an evaluation criterion on the benefits side.\nAs Draper highlights, there are difficulties in the model when it comes to allocating cost\ninformation to activities. For example, time spent at a conference might benefit both\nteaching and research activities. Although costing staff time is difficult (see Rumble, 1997),\nwe must attempt at least rough estimates of allocations for different activities. Otherwise\nwe might as well abandon any attempt to evaluate activities within higher education or to\nplan future investments. That said, the model advocates a light touch approach to\nestimating staff time, a much less rigorous methodology than that recommended by the\nHE Transparency Review (Joint Costing and Pricing Steering Group (JCPSG), 1999). This\ntype of broad estimating has the inevitable consequence that the 'cost' side of the CBA\nexercise cannot claim great accuracy. However, we believe that the process of investigating\nand debating the costs is, in itself, useful and that sensitivity analysis can be used to assess\nthe potential impact that variations in the estimates of staff time will have on the final\nCBA evaluation outcomes.\nJust as the model does not limit what benefits can be included, the model does not\nproscribe what costs should be included in the evaluation. Indeed, the model encourages\ninstitutions to identify all activities that have a bearing on the investment options under\nevaluation. Draper is concerned about 'learning costs' such as the basic skills training of\nnew students. The model represents this as a 'support activity'. A percentage of the total\ncost (made up of staff costs, revenue costs, capital costs, etc.) of 'learning' support can be\nallocated to the activities associated with each ICT investment option; that percentage\nwould be determined using a suitable metric (for example, number of students).\nIt is true that the CBA model attempts to reduce all factors to quantifiable inputs and\nmeasurable, but qualitative, outputs. Users end up with a single figure for each\nimplementation option, although choice is based on what trade-off between costs and\nbenefits fits best with institutional priorities. The institution might decide on the lowest\ncost, the highest benefit or something in between. However, the process of getting to these\ninputs and outputs is much more important than the figures themselves.\nWhile defending the model we acknowledge that many problems remain. In the original\npaper we implicitly assumed that large-scale ICT intervention in learning would be 'top-\ndown', that is, a strategy would be defined and options could be evaluated through CBA\nwith reference to an institution's strategic objectives (potential benefits). While an\nindividual's perspective of the benefits of an activity might vary over time (before, during\nand after), as Draper notes, we assumed that the long-term strategic objectives expressed in\nan institution's learning or e-learning strategy would be stable over time and would provide\nan appropriate context for the evaluation of large-scale investments. Moreover, we\nassumed that these strategic objectives would have been developed by an institution based\non its understanding of educational processes not, as Draper seems to suggest, that the\nCBA evaluation would be used to investigate the learning processes themselves.\nHowever, further work in studying the risks associated with ICT investments in teaching\nand learning, has led us to review some of these assumptions (Nicol and Coen, 2003). This\ntype of 'top-down' approach to strategic management and investment is not the only\n123\nDavid Nicol and Michael Caen The importance of cost-benefit analysis: a response\napproach that can be taken. Many institutions adopt a 'bottom-up' approach - funding a\nrange of ICT projects with the intention of gaining practical experience and exploring\n(rather than planning) benefits. With this 'thousand flowers bloom' approach institutions\nrefine their strategies based on the outcomes of pilot implementations and a complex mix\nof factors (pedagogical, political, cultural, financial) determine which models are more\nwidely adopted within the institution.\nAs Draper points out, we do not yet fully understand all the consequences for institutions\nof ICT investment in teaching and learning. Therefore, where 'bottom-up' experimentation\nis prevalent, CBA, with its reliance on a set of planned objectives, may not be the most\nappropriate tool. Other techniques such as the Balanced Scorecard (Kaplan and Norton,\n1996) may provide a better tool for the management and evaluation of ICT investments. In\nthe Balanced Scorecard methodology a handful of critical perspectives are defined, such as\na 'financial' perspective, a student perspective and a staff perspective. The methodology\nadvocates the use of performance measurement to facilitate a process of continual\nperformance review and improvement against each of these perspectives. This type of\nmanagement tool may have particular applicability in early, small-scale implementations of\nICT in teaching and learning where costs and benefits are difficult to forecast and\nresources (staff time and cash expenditure) are not limited to, or defined by, a strict\nbudgetary limit. This type of methodology might also address Draper's call for an\nalternative management method that is less heavily reliant on accountancy and financial\nconsiderations.\nHowever, at some point each institution, armed with the knowledge gained from its\nexperimentation, is forced to decide whether to invest potentially large sums of money in\nexpanding and\/or embedding successful models or, in rare cases, transforming the learning\nexperience and associated institutional processes entirely. In this type of situation much\nmore structured evaluation, of the type proposed by the Insight CBA model, is required.\nThe model cannot guarantee that the information on costs and benefits that institutions\nfeed into it is appropriate, but it does provide a structured, transparent framework through\nwhich institutions can insure that all relevant views have been reflected in the CBA and in\nstrategic investment decisions.\nReferences\nJoint Costing and Pricing Steering Group (JCPSG) (1999), Transparency Review,\nManchester, http:\/\/www.jcpsg.ac.uk\/transpar\/index.htm\nKaplan, R.
