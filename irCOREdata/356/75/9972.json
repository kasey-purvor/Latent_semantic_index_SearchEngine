The \n1H-NMR data is presented as follows: chemical \nshift (in ppm on the \u03b4 scale), integration, multiplicity (s= singlet, d= doublet, t= triplet, q= quartet, m= multiplet), \ncoupling constant (J in Hz) and structural assignment. The \n13C-NMR data is reported as ppm on the \u03b4 scale, \nfollowed by the structural assignment. High resolution mass spectrometry was performed by the EPSRC \nNational Mass Spectrometry Service Centre, Swansea, using Finnigan MAT 95XP and Finnigan MAT 900XLT \ninstruments ES analysis. The data is presented as the ionisation method, followed by the calculated and \nmeasured masses. TLC was preformed on Merck 60 F254 silica plates and visualised by UV light and\/or KMnO4 \nstain. Compound purification was carried out by wet flash column chromatography using Merck Kieselgel 60 \n(particle size 35-70). Eluent constitution is quoted as ratios or percentages. All solvents were dried before use \nunless otherwise stated. Anhydrous solvents were obtained from a solvent purification system supplied by \nwww.glasscontoursolventsystems.com or a PureSolv solvent purification system supplied by Innovative \nTechnologies Inc.
