INTRODUCTION \nThe growth of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired \nimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been the subject of much recent \ntheoretical and medical research (see, for example, 12-4, 8, 18, 201). As \nmore becomes known about AIDS, the mathematical models proposed to \naccount for the spread of the disease become more complex. The 1988 \npaper by Hyman and Stanley [151 contains a review of some of the main \nprocesses involved and presents numerical simulations of several models \nthat account for such factors as variable infectiousness of individuals and \nvariable incubation periods in a homosexual community. Anderson et al. [5] \npresented a model for the spread of disease in the U.K. homosexual \n*This paper was submitted while the authors were at the Department of Mathematics, \nUniversity of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah. \nMATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES 106:129-150 (1991) \nOElsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., 1991 \n129 \n655 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10010 0025-5564\/91\/$03.50 \n130 G. DE YOUNG, P. K. MAINI, AND M. NAKAMAYE \npopulation using field data and considered the effects of changes in sexual \nbehavior. Anderson and coworkers [6, 191 analyzed a model for the spread \nof AIDS in heterosexual communities in developing countries and explored \nthe effects of control strategies. Although the majority of AIDS cases in \ndeveloped countries occur in the homosexual community, the disease is \nspreading into the heterosexual community. Hethcote [14] presented a \ngeneral model that accounts for interaction between heterosexuals, bisexu- \nals, homosexuals, and intravenous drug abusers. \nModels of a homogeneous population in which behavior is constant with \ntime predict that the initial growth of disease is exponential with constant \ngrowth rate. However, recent surveys show that the total number of AIDS \ncases reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDCI in the United \nStates has grown as the cube of time [9, 11, 15, 161, which implies that the \ngrowth rate is decreasing inversely with time. These data relate to AIDS \npatients infected before the publicity campaigns for AIDS prevention \nbegan; thus it is improbable that cubic growth is due to modified sexual \nbehavior. Hyman and Stanley [16] proposed a model (hereafter referred to \nas HSM) for HIV transmission within a homosexual community based on \nbiased mixing; that is, the community is divided into categories consisting of \nindividuals of similar risk behavior (where risk is quantified by the number \nof sexual partners), and it is assumed that individuals interact mainly with \npeople of similar risk behavior. With this assumption, the magnitude of the \nepidemic, the expected time of its peak, and its growth rate all depend \nupon how different risk groups are distributed and how they interact with \none another. Whereas the assumption of random mixing leads to the \nprediction that large numbers of low-risk individuals-that is, those who \nhave relatively few new sexual partners per year-will become infected \nearly on in the epidemic, biased mixing predicts an infection wave that \npasses from high-risk groups into those of lower risk. Colgate et al. [lo] \nshowed that a biased mixing model predicts cubic rather than exponential \ngrowth and hence is in accord with present data on AIDS cases. \nThe intuitive explanation for these quite different predictions is that \nwith random mixing the infection tends to spread most rapidly in the most \ndensely populated risk groups, which correspond to low-risk individuals. \nBiased mixing, however, assumes that high-risk individuals interact primar- \nily among themselves; hence, they are the group who suffer most at the \noutset of the epidemic while lower risk individuals are not affected until the \nwave of infection has passed through intermediate risk groups. Hyman and \nStanley [16] call this wave a \u201csaturation wave,\u201d where saturation refers to \nthe state of maximum infection in a given group. The term saturation is \nperhaps a little confusing as it suggests that no more individuals are \ninfected after this point, which is not the case. We shall refer to this state \nas the state of maximum infection (SMI); that is, this is the point in a \nRISK-BASED MODEL FOR AIDS 131 \nparticular risk group when the number of newly infected individuals in that \ngroup is a maximum. After this point individuals continue to become \ninfected but at a lesser rate. \nOne important consequence of this infection wave is that as it progresses \ninto the lower risk groups, the intrinsic growth rate of the epidemic \ndecreases proportionately so that rather than pure exponential growth the \nmodel predicts a polynomial growth rate in AIDS cases that can be \napproximated by a cubic [lo, 161. Another consequence of the infection \nwave is that within a lower risk group the growth of HIV is rather \ncomplicated: At first, growth is exponential at a rate that corresponds to \nthe intrinsic growth rate within this risk group, but as time progresses this \nintrinsic growth rate becomes dominated by the people infected from \nindividuals in higher risk groups. Thus, one might predict that the total \nnumber of infected individuals at a given time could be approximated by a \nsum of exponentials (corresponding to risk groups far in front of the \ninfection wave) and time-dependent exponentials that include both an \nintrinsic growth rate and interference from other risk groups. This interpre- \ntation differs from that of Colgate et al. [lo]. \nA mathematical model that contains all factors that may contribute to \nthe spread of AIDS would be very complex and impossible to solve \nanalytically. Moreover, initial numerical simulation would provide little \ninsight into the effect each factor has on the spread of infection and the \ninteractions occurring between different factors. Consequently it is neces- \nsary, at first, to study simplified versions of the more general model that \nfocus on particular aspects of the epidemic. In this paper we focus on \nbiased mixing in a homosexual community, and we ignore such factors as \nvariable infectiousness and variable incubation periods, which are ac- \ncounted for in HSM. We stress that our model and analysis are not \nintended to give accurate predictions on the growth of the AIDS infection; \nrather, they are aimed at understanding how a particular assumption on \nbiased mixing affects the spread of the disease. We show that although the \ntotal number of AIDS cases can be approximated very well with a polyno- \nmial, the mechanism according to which the disease is spreading may \nperhaps be better explained as a sum of various functions that differ \nsignificantly from polynomials. \nIn Section 2, we formulate a discrete model that is similar in many \nrespects to the Hyman and Stanley continuous model with biased mixing \nbut contains some simplifying assumptions. In Section 3, we present numer- \nical simulations of our model to show that it captures the qualitative \nbehavior of the more complex model. In Section 4 we derive expressions for \nthe time to SMI in a particular risk compartment, the proportion of \ninfected individuals at SMI, and the growth of infection up to SMI. Finally, \nin Section 5, we discuss our results. \n132 G. DE YOUNG, P. K. MAINI, AND M. NAKAMAYE \n2. MODEL EQUATIONS \nWe restrict our study to the case of a homosexual community. We \nseparate individuals into three general categories: uninfected susceptibles, \ninfecteds without AIDS, and diagnosed AIDS cases. A susceptible person \ncan become infected through sexual contact with an infected individual. We \nassume that movement from one category to another obeys the law of mass \naction. It is not known what fraction of individuals with HIV eventually \nproceed to develop AIDS. In this model, we assume this fraction to be 1, \nthat is, that everyone with HIV will eventually develop AIDS. Those \nindividuals who have AIDS are assumed to be removed from the popula- \ntion in the sense that they are no longer sexually active. We divide each of \nthe three categories into n different compartments, or activity classes, \ndefined by risk behavior. Each compartment initially contains l\/n of the \ntotal population under consideration. The risk behavior of each compart- \nment is given by a mean risk defined as the average number of sexual \npartners per year (see [7] for a detailed discussion on different methods for \nquantifying activity within a particular class). Interaction within and be- \ntween compartments is assumed to be homogeneous. There is a constant \nrecruitment rate into all susceptible compartments that is assumed to be \ninitially equal to the natural death rate so that the population is initially at \nequilibrium; this simplifies analysis and is a common assumption [3, 161. \nWe introduce the following definitions: \nt = time (years) \nII = number of compartments \nS,(t) = number of susceptibles in the kth compartment at time t \nZ,(t) = number of infecteds in the k th compartment at time t \nAk( t) = number of AIDS cases in the kth compartment at time t \nNk( t) = total number of sexually active individuals in the k th \ncompartment at time t, that is S,(t) + I,(t) \np = transmission efficiency per contact \ny = rate at which infected individuals develop AIDS (per year) \np = natural death rate (per year) \nS = death rate due to AIDS (per year) \nMk = average number of sexual partners per year \nin the k th compartment \nB, = recruitment into the k th compartment (per year) \nc( k, j) = average number of sexual contacts per partnership \nbetween people from compartments k and .i \nRISK-BASED MODEL FOR AIDS 133 \nI fiMkXk(t)Sk(t) \nI 6&,(t) \nFIG. 1.

The term \nx,(t) accounts for interaction with other compartments (see text for definitions). \np( t , k, j) = probability that a person in compartment k forms a \npartnership with a person in compartment j at time f \nWith these definitions, our model can be formulated as follows (see \nFigure 1 for compartmental diagram): \nds, \n-=Bk-PM~XXk(t)Sk(t)-\/1Sk(t), dt (1) \ndlk dt=p\u201d,X,(t)S,(c)-(I*+r)zk(t), \ndA \n~=yIk(t)-(p+8)Ak(t). \ndt \n(2) \n(3) \nIn the above equations, Xk(t) is the expected number of contacts that an \nindividual in the kth compartment will have with infected individuals: \nljCt) \n&(t) = 5 p(t,k,j)c(k,j)N(t). \nj=l J \n(4) \nWe assume that high-risk individuals have approximately one contact per \npartnership but that the number of contacts per partnership increases for \nlower risk groups up to some maximum value. These assumptions may be \ncaptured by taking \nc( k, j) = 1 + cleKcZCMk+~), (3 \n134 G. DE YOUNG, P. K. MAINI, AND M. NAKAMAYE \nwhere ct and c2 are (positive) constants to be determined [16]. For our \nanalytical proposes, only the qualitative form of c(k, j) is important. \nIt is hypothesized that an individual infected with HIV undergoes an \ninitial short period of high infectivity followed by a long period of low \ninfectivity and then a period of high infectiousness immediately prior to \ndeveloping AIDS [l]. (This hypothesis is based on virus in the blood, which \nmay not be related to infectivity.) It also appears that the rate at which \nindividuals develop AIDS varies with time from infection [lo]. This suggests \nmore complicated forms of X,(t) and of y that depend also on time from \ninfection. For example, Jacquez et al. [17] model the long period to \ninfectiousness prior to the onset of AIDS by a series of compartments that \nrepresent different stages of infection. However, to simplify analysis, we \nignore this dependence. We also assume that people with AIDS die from \nthe disease at a constant rate. The choices of y and 6 correspond to means \ntaken over observed rates. \nIt remains to define p(t, k, j) in a way that accounts for biased mixing. \nIn order to do this, we first need an interaction function, f(r,s>, which \ngives the frequency with which a person of risk r forms a partnership with a \nperson of risk s, where r and s are continuous variables corresponding to \nMk, We simply use the interaction function given by Hyman and Stanley \n[ 161, namely, \nI \n-1 \nf(r,s)= 1+ (r--)m 1 E(r+T,.)m \u2019 (f-9 \nwhere we take r, = 10, m = 2, and vary E according to the degree of mixing \nwe wish to allow between different risk groups. This function attains its \nmaximum of 1 when r = s and becomes very small when r and s are far \napart, corresponding to the assumption that a person in risk group r \ninteracts mostly with others of similar risk. Using this frequency function, \nwe can define our probability function, recalling that Mk is the mean \nnumber of sexual partners in the kth compartment, as \np(t,k,i) = \n\u2019 f(Mk,MiPWi(f) \n~ f(Mk,Mj)Mj~~:(t) If \u2018> k7 \nj=l \nf(Mi,Mk)MiW(f) \n5 ~(M,,M,)M~Y(~) If lck\u2019 \nj=l \nI- c p(t,k,.O if i=k. \n, j#k \nRISK-BASED MODEL FOR AIDS 135 \nWe motivate the form of this function as follows. When i > k, we assume \nthat the probability that an individual in the kth compartment interacts \nwith one in the ith compartment is equal to the number of partnerships \nthat a person in the kth compartment forms with individuals in the ith \ncompartment, divided by the total number of partners that an individual in \nthe kth compartment has. When i < k, p(t, k, i) must be adjusted because \nthe total number of partnerships between the kth and ith compartments \nmust equal the total number of partnerships between the ith and kth \ncompartments; thus, \nFinally, p(t, k, k) has been defined so that the probability of selecting a \npartner from the entire population is 1. This function is the discrete analog \nof the continuous probability function, p(t, r, s), used in HSM. Clearly one \ncould assume different types of interaction function f that would, in turn, \nlead to different probability functions. The particular f chosen here is \nsimply a quantitative example that captures the essential qualitative fea- \ntures of the assumptions on biased mixing. The paper by Stanley [20] \ndiscusses this in more detail. \n3. NUMERICAL RESULTS \nTo illustrate the behavior of the model described by Equations (l)-(3), \nin our numerical simulations we choose parameter values and initial condi- \ntions similar to those used in HSM, namely, 6 = 0.5, y = 0.133, \/L = 0.02, \np = 0.025, c(k, j) = 1+ 10e-\u201c.\u2018(MktM~), B, = @Sk(O), Z,(O) = 103M, \/Cy=,M,. \nA,(O) = 0. The infected individuals are thus initially distributed according \nto risk so that at the outset of the epidemic there are more high-risk \ninfecteds than low-risk (similar to HSM). This accounts for the observation \nthat regardless of where the infection starts, it will rapidly move toward the \nhigher risk groups. The qualitative nature of our numerical simulations is \nindependent of the form of this initial condition. For the initial distribution \nof the population according to risk r we use the inverse quartic given in \n[lOI> \nN(r) = \n3No.4g3 \n(48+ r)4 \u2019 \nand we take N,, the total initial population, to be 106. With this distribu- \n136 G. DE YOUNG, P. K. MAINI, AND M. NAKAMAYE \ntion, the mean risk in compartment k is given by \nj*\u2018+\u2018rN( r) dr \nMk= \u2018li \njrk+\u2018N( r) dr \u2019 \nr!i \n(7) \nwhere r,, = 0, r,, =m, and \/$+IN(r)dr = No\/n. \nIn the simplest case, where IZ = 1, our model essentially reduces to the \nsimple homogeneous model formulated by Anderson and May [2], the \nprimary difference being that we do not have a second class of infected \nindividuals who do not go on to develop AIDS. In the next simplest case, \nII = 2, we consider only two groups of people, low-risk and high-risk. In this \ncase, the most important factor that affects qualitative behavior is the form \nof f(r, s). Taking E very small, there is only negligible interaction between \nlow- and high-risk groups. One would thus expect two independent waves \nof infection that, initially, are exponential. Total growth of number of \ninfected individuals in this case would be the sum of these exponentials (see \nFigure 2). As E increases, Z,(t) remains exponential but It(t) becomes \n7x1 O6 \n1 \n0 \n0 5 10 15 \nTime$ks) \n25 30 35 40 \nFIG. 2. Numerical solution of Equations (l)-(3) for two risk compartments. The time \nwhen the infection wave reaches the low-risk group depends heavily upon the rate of \ninteraction between low-risk and high-risk groups.

(a) With only two compartments, the simple discrete model given by Equations \n(l)-(3) exhibits behavior that is qualitatively similar to that of the more complex HSM \n[16] and to the model of Jacquez et al. [17]. After a brief, initial exponential phase, the \ngrowth of the total number of AIDS cases, A(t ), is polynomial. The double-peak behavior \nof the infecteds, I(?), occurs because we have only two risk groups with a weak \ninteraction. By taking more risk groups, the effect of high-risk individuals on low-risk \nindividuals is mediated through intermediate compartments moothing out the curve of \ninfection. (b) shows the behavior for six compartments. In both (a) and (b), E = 0.01. S(t) \nis the total number of susceptibles and I(t) the total number of infecteds. \n138 G. DE YOUNG, P. K. MAINI, AND M. NAKAMAYE \nincreasingly distorted by interaction with the high-risk group. When E is \nmade large enough, the distortion is so great that the cumulative number of \ninfecteds is smoothed out. This behavior is similar to that observed in the \nmore complicated model of Jacquez et al. [17]. It is important to note that \nthe two independent waves of infection in Figure 2a are a result of our \ndiscretization. This type of behavior would be observed in reality only if it \nwere possible to identify two groups with different risk behavior that \ninteracted only weakly. We note that even in the simplest case of two \ncompartments we get behavior that is remarkably similar, at least qualita- \ntively, to the predictions made by the more complicated HSM (see Figure \n3). We also note that this serves to confirm that the rate at which the \nepidemic spreads and the shape of the infection wave depend heavily upon \nthe rate of mixing between highly dissimilar groups [lo, 151. When mixing is \ngreat, the infection wave approaches that predicted by the Anderson and \nMay model in which partner selection is random. \nWith six compartments, one sees the infection wave predicted by HSM \n(see Figure 4). As was the case with the two-compartment model, the \nhighest risk group initially exhibits exponential growth of infectives, which \nslows down prior to the group reaching SMI; in fact, we will see in the next \n3 6 x 10\u2019 \n1.4 \n1 2 \n10 \nP \n$ 0.8 \n\u2018; \n06 \nFIG. 4.

High-risk groups become infected early on, and the epidemic slowly passes into \nlower risk groups. \nRISK-BASED MODEL FOR AIDS 139 \nTABLE 1 \nComparison of the Fraction wk of Individuals Infected at SMI in Each Risk Group k \nObtained from Numerically Solving the Full System Given by Equations (l)-(3) with the \nBounds Calculated from Equation (14)* \nk Risk (M,) wk Lower bound (14) Upper bound (14) \n1 9 0.7390 0.7221 0.7486 \n2 28 0.7912 0.7583 0.8022 \n3 47 0.8687 0.8337 0.8743 \n4 66 0.9047 0.8659 0.9095 \n5 84 0.9262 0.8818 0.9294 \n6 103 0.9396 0.8913 0.9422 \n7 122 0.9484 0.8994 0.9510 \n8 140 0.9563 0.9112 0.9574 \n9 161 0.9613 0.9315 0.9625 \n10 190 0.9679 0.9545 0.9682 \n11 248 0.9737 0.9721 0.9754 \n12 599 0.9907 0.9897 0.9898 \n*We estimate the amount of out-of-group mixing at SMI, tnk, by the initial out-of-group \nmixing. \nsection that up to SMI the growth of infectives for the highest risk \ncompartment may be approximated by logistic growth. The other compart- \nments have an intrinsic exponential growth that becomes dominated by the \ngrowth in higher risk compartments as they approach SMI. The total \nnumber of AIDS cases exhibits polynomial growth, similar to HSM. In each \ncase, the greatest interference comes, as one might expect, from neighbor- \ning higher risk groups. Even when interaction rates between greatly differ- \ning risk groups are low, there may be no apparent delay in the total growth \nof infecteds, as there was in the two-compartment case, because the \nintermediate risk groups through which the infection wave passes before it \nreaches the lowest risk individuals may smooth out the total infected curve. \nWith a finer discretization (more compartments), the qualitative and quan- \ntitative differences are small, the main quantitative difference being that \nwith many compartments the infection wave can reach low-risk individuals \nslightly sooner as a result of the introduction of a larger number of \nintermediate risk groups. We note that as risk decreases, the level of \ninfection at SMI, measured by the fraction of people infected at SMI within \na risk group, also decreases (see Table 1). This result is similar to that \nobtained by Jacquez et al. [171 with their more complicated model. \n4. ANALYSIS 0F THE EPIDEMIC \nIn this section we derive analytical expressions for the percentage of \nindividuals infected in each risk compartment at SMI and the time to SMI. \n140 G. DE YOUNG, P. K. MAINI, AND M. NAKAMAYE \nWe first note that the model given by Equations (l)-(3) is unrealistic for \npeople in very low risk compartments. We expect that such individuals \nwould be engaged in long-term partnerships and that a pairing model of the \ntype proposed by Dietz [12] would be more realistic. Therefore, the \nfollowing analysis applies only to middle- and high-risk groups. \n4.1. FRACTION INFECTED IN EACH RISK COMPARTMENT AT SW \nAt the SMI time t, (or at steady state) in a given compartment k, \ndIk \/dt = 0. We proceed to calculate bounds on the fraction of individuals \ninfected in each particular risk group as follows. We define \nwk = Ik\/Nk, (8) \nwhere Zk and Nk are evaluated at SMI in risk category k. We let mk be the \nprobability of out-of-group mixing for risk category k at SMI; thus \nat SMI. \n(9) \nFrom the definition of xk and c(k, j) and the observation that wk i 1 \nfor all k, the following inequalities are immediate: \n(1-m~)c(k,k)wk,<X~~c(k,l)mk+(l-m,)c(k,k)w,. (10) \nLetting a, = (1 - m,)c(k, k) and pk = c(k, l)mk, Equation (10) becomes \nffkwk < x, < pk + a,wk. (11) \nAt SMI in the compartment with risk k, dZk \/dt = 0; hence, from Equation \n(2), \nwk=xk\/(xk+ak) (12) \nwhere (Ye = (CL + y)\/pMk. Now the function S(x) = x\/(x + A) is an in- \ncreasing function of x for positive A; hence from Equation (11) we have \nakwk \n< wk < \npk + ukwk \nukwk + \u201ck pk+\u201ckwk+ak\u2019 \n(13) \nFrom these inequalities we deduce the following bounds on wk: \nmax(O, 1 - ak \/ak) < wk < hk+, (14) \nwhere Ak+ iS the larger real rOOt Of the quadratic crkX2 +(pk + cxk - uk>X - \npk = 0. Note that if mk = 0, that is, there is no out of group mixing at SMI, \nRISK-BASED MODEL FOR AIDS 141 \n2 \n1 \n0 \n0 3 6 9 12 15 \nTime (years) \nFIG. 5. Numerical simulation of Equations (l)-(3) with risk groups as in Table 1 \nshowing (a) spread of infection, Ik(t), (b) number of AIDS cases, A,(t), and Cc) total \nnumber of individuals, Ark(t), in each compartment. At SMI in the medium- and high-risk \ngroups, the number of individuals in each group is roughly the same as before the \ninfection began. That is, at SMI in medium- and high-risk groups, few people have \ndeveloped AIDS. Also note that the ratio I, \/Nk is approximately constant after SMI. \nHere we show the results for the risk group k = 9. The qualitative form of the graph is \nsimilar for other high risk groups. \nthen pk = 0, which implies that the lower and upper bounds are equal and \nwe have an exact value for wk. Note that Equation (14) also holds at steady \nstate for infection. \nClearly these bounds are very close together for small to medium \nout-of-group mixing, which will be the case from the form of the acceptance \nfunction f given by Equation (6). Table I shows the values of wk obtained \nfor a set of risk categories from simulating the full system given by \nEquations (l)-(3) together with the bounds calculated from the inequalities \ngiven in (14). \nTo calculate the number of infecteds in risk group k at SMI we need to \nknow the number of individuals iVk(fk> in that risk group at SMI. From \ncurve (cl in Figure 5, it is clear that N,(t,) is approximately equal to the \ninitial population number, No\/n, in high- and medium-risk groups. This \nobservation implies that by the time SMI is reached in a particular \ncompartment, the number of individuals who have gone on to develop \nAIDS in that compartment is small. Thus, the number of infectives in risk \n142 G. DE YOUNG, P. K. MAINI, AND M. NAKAMAYE \ngroup k at SMI can be estimated by \nZk(tk) = N,hk, \/n. (15) \nIn Appendix A, we show that this is an overestimate of the actual \nnumber of infectives at SMI in a particular risk group. \n4.2. THE TIME TO SMI \nWe now find estimates on the time tk taken to reach SMI in the \ncompartment with risk Mk. Assuming that at time tk the number of \ninfectives in lower risk compartments is small (see Figure 41, Equation (2) \ncan be approximated by \ndt =pMk t p(t,k>j)c(k,_Q \ndlk \ni=k \nG\u201d*(\u2018) -(\/1+ Y)zk(t)* (16) \nI \nAs we have noted above, this model is realistic only for middle- and \nhigh-risk groups; thus, c(k, j) = 1. As SMI approaches in a risk group k, we \nassume that higher risk groups are at SMI or at steady state. Furthermore, \nour simulations suggest that the probability of interaction between two risk \ngroups remains virtually constant, as does Nk(t). Thus, Equation (16) may \nbe approximated by \np(W,k)#+ k P(O, k,j>wj [ Nk(o) - zk(t)] \nj=k+l 1 \n-(p + -\/)ldt), (17) \nwhich yields the solution \na + Ka2eb,( \n\u2018dt) = \u2018I+ Keb,t \u2019 \nwhere \n(18) \nb, = pM,P(o, k, k), b, = pMk 2 p(O, k,.dwj, \nj=k+l \nb3 = Nk(o) \nh,(a2-al), \nK = Ik(O) - \u20181 \na2 - Ik(O) \u2019 \nRISK-BASED MODEL FOR AIDS \nI I \n0 1 2 \nTime (yeorsf \n4 5 \n(a) \n9 \nI \na j ~____~_,\u201c______~____ , i \n2 \n1 \nI \n143 \n\/ \n* ,\u2019 22 I \/ \n0 1 2 \nTime (yearsf \n4 5 \n(b) \nFIG. 6.

As a group approaches its SMI it is clear that the \nlogistic growth of Equation (17) will break down prior to SMI. This results \nfrom infected individuals in higher risk groups developing AIDS, thus \ndecreasing the \u201cgrowth\u201d term in (16). Hence, the true value of Z,(t) never \nreaches a2 as Equation (18) suggests. As a result we estimate the time to \nSMI as \nt, = $og[ &y_$ 1. \nNote that in the above analysis the wj\u2019s are unknown. Since we are \nassuming that the higher risk groups are at steady state or at SMI, we may \napproximate wj by Aj+ (from Table 1). Furthermore, although we cannot \nfind an a priori value for 4, our numerical simulations show that the \nlogistic growth curve approximates the actual growth up to a very large \nRISK-BASED MODEL FOR AIDS 145 \nTABLE 2 \nComparison of Time to SMI, t,, from Equation (19) with the Actual SMI Time \nfor High-Risk Groups* \nk tk (sum k + 1 to N) \n9 2.31 \n10 2.01 \n11 1.80 \n12 0.89 \n*See text for details. \ntk (sum k +2 to N) Actual tk \n3.64 2.76 \n3.16 2.46 \n2.62 1.98 \n0.89 0.88 \nfraction of the carrying capacity a2 and that Equation (19) is reasonably \ninsensitive to the actual value of C$ for large values.

Furthermore, the approximation to the \ngrowth of infection given by Equation (18) grows too quickly. This is to be \nFIG. 7.

This is true for \ncompartments of risk much higher than that in question, but not for the \nimmediate higher risk group, in which the infection is still growing. Thus \nthe sum from j = k + 1 to N in Equation (17) is an overestimate of the \ninteraction that compartment k experiences with infecteds from higher risk \ngroups. For high-risk groups, therefore, we get a lower bound on the time \nto SMI. Summing from j = k + 2 to N would give us an upper bound for \nthe time to SMI for high-risk groups (see Table 2 and Figure 6b,c). Note \nthat for lower risk groups it is impossible to say a priori whether the above \npredictions are upper or lower bounds because other factors, such as death \ndue to AIDS in the very high risk groups, come into play. \nIn Appendix B we outline a multi-time-scale procedure to approximate \nthe growth to SMI of infecteds in high-risk groups (Figure 7). Figure 8 \nshows that the number of infecteds in high-risk groups exhibits logistic \ngrowth just prior to SMI. \n5. DISCUSSION \nWe have analyzed the growth of HIV in a simplified version of the \nmodel presented by Hyman and Stanley [15] for a homosexual community \nRISK-BASED MODEL FOR AIDS 147 \nwherein sexual behavior is assumed to be heterogeneous. Because of the \nsimplifying assumptions we make, our model cannot give accurate predic- \ntions for the spread of HIV infection. This is also true of the more \ncomplicated models. However, the simple form of our model captures much \nof the qualitative behavior of more complex models and enables us to \nquantitatively analyze the spread of infection through different risk groups \nand to investigate the dynamics of the spread from one risk group to \nanother. Moreover, we can calculate upper and lower bounds for the \nfraction infected at SMI and the time to SMI in high-risk groups in terms of \nthe parameters of the model. For example, Equation (14) shows that the \nfraction of individuals infected at SMI in a particular risk group increases \nas out-of-group mixing increases or as the average number of sexual \npartners increases. Our analysis shows that the growth of HIV infection \nappears to be composed of several .parts. Initially, when the infection wave \nis passing through the highest risk group, growth of the infection is \napproximately logistic, but as it reaches high- and middle-risk groups, \ninterference begins to play a large role and complicates behavior. We \npresent a two-time-scale procedure to analyze this case and show that \ngrowth of infection in middle- and high-risk groups may be closely approxi- \nmated by an initial exponential phase followed by a logistic growth phase \nup to SMI. \nOne important aspect of risk-based models is the quantification of risk. \nIn both our model and HSM there is no difference in intrinsic growth rates \nbetween a group of individuals who have 50 contacts with one partner over \na year and a group who have one contact with 50 different individuals. Yet \nthere clearly ought to be a difference in the way infection spreads in such \ngroups. In such cases we need to use a model similar to that proposed by \nDietz [12], which takes into account the duration of relationships. Thus we \nrestrict the analysis of our model to that of middle- and high-risk individu- \nals. Low-risk behavior should be modeled as in [12]. Furthermore, contact \npatterns are also important. Jacquez et al. [17] presented a detailed \nnumerical analysis of the effects of different contact patterns. Recently, \nGupta et al. [13] analyzed the significance of the sexual contact network by \nstudying a number of cases ranging from the extremes of high within-class \ncontact to low within-class contact. Anderson et al. [5] considered the case \nof movement between sexual activity classes as a result of change in \nbehavior. In this paper we have presented a model that assumes one \nparticular type of contact pattern and, in terms of risk-based behavior, is \nappropriate for middle- and high-risk groups. The analysis presented here \nis a first step in analyzing more complex behavior patterns. \nIn this paper we have used the abbreviation SMI to describe the state of \na risk compartment when it reaches maximum infection. This terminology \ncontrasts with that of Hyman and Stanley. Their terminology may be \n148 G. DE YOUNG, P. K. MAINI, AND M. NAKAMAYE \nmisleading, for the term saturation usually means that a certain carrying \ncapacity has been attained and that the system will remain there for some \ntime. A more appropriate, albeit more cumbersome, term is state of \nmaximum infection, which we employ here. \nThis work was started while M. N. was attending an NSF-funded REU \nprogram, grant number NSF DMS 8900490, at the Department of Mathemat- \nics, Uniuersity of Utah, during the summer quarter of 1989. G. D. Y. would \nlike to acknowledge NIH grant #GM29123-09, and to thank the Department \nof Mathematics, University of Utah, for financial support. \nAPPENDIX A. NUMBER OF INFECTIVE INDIVIDUALS AT SMI \nHere we show that Equation (1.5) is an overestimate of the number of \nindividuals infected in a particular risk group at SMI in that risk group. We \nshow, in fact, that (i> A:(m,(O)) > A:(m,(t,)) and (ii> N,(O) > Nk(tk). \nTo show (i) we first recall that Ak+ is the larger root of the quadratic \nakx2 + ( pk + ayk - u,>x - pk = 0, where a,, pk, and LYE are defined in the \ntext. Differentiating this quadratic with respect to m, the mixing, we have \ndr [c(k,k)x-c(k,l)](x-1) \nXL= (2x - l)ok + pk + CYyk (\u20184.1) \nAs the model is realistic only for medium- and high-risk groups, we may \napproximate both c(k, k) and c(k, 1) by 1. Thus, Equation (A.l) becomes \nand, clearly, \ndx \ndm \u201d \n(A.21 \n(A.3) \nOur numerical simulations show that m,(t,) < m,(O) and that hkf > l\/2. \nTherefore, Equation (A.31 shows that A:(mk(O>> 2 A:(m,(tk)). \nTo show (ii), we add Equations (1) and (2) to get \nT = cL[N#) - N,c(t)] - ddo) - Yldt). \nClearly, dNk \/dt Q 0 at N,(t) = N,(O); hence Nk(tk) < N,(O). \n(A.41 \nAPPENDIX B. TIME-SCALE MATCHING \nAs shown in Figure 6 and Table 2, the approximation in Equation (17) is \ngood for the highest risk group but is poor for lower risk groups. This is \nRISK-BASED MODEL FOR AIDS 149 \nbecause the approximation made in Equation (17) assumes that during the \nwhole course of infection in a particular risk group, all higher risk groups \nare at SMI or steady state. Although this is a good approximation for the \nlatter stages of infection in a particular risk group, it is invalid for the initial \nstage. During the early stages of infection in a medium- or high-risk group, \nits neighboring groups will also be in early stages of infection. Thus, a \nbetter approximation to the growth of infection in a risk group k during the \nearly stages would be to put b, = 0 in Equation (18), that is, assume that \nthere is no infection from other risk groups. The approximation to the \ninitial growth of infection is thus given by Equation (18) with b, = 0. In \norder to get a solution up to SMI, one has to match this to the solution of \nthe more general form of Equation (18) with b, nonzero where, in the \nlatter, one has to replace Z,(O) with the value of Zk at the matching time. \nFigure 7 shows the result of this procedure. The matching time, t,, was \ntaken to be the time at which Z, = 103, that is, \n1 103 \ntm = a \u2018n m. \nNote that although we approximate the initial phase of infection by logistic \ngrowth, because the number of infected individuals is small this is approxi- \nmately exponential. \nAlthough crude, the above procedure proved to be reasonably accurate \nfor estimating Zk(t) for high-risk groups. The procedure assumes that there \nare two phases for infection up to SMI: an initial exponential growth phase \nin which the group acts mainly within itself, and a later logistic growth \nphase in which the group interacts with higher risk groups all of which are \nat SMI or steady state. A numerical study of the medium- and high-risk \ngroups shows that they do exhibit logistic growth toward SMI (Figure 8). A \nmore refined scheme would take account of the transition phase, wherein \nthe interaction of the group with higher risk groups changes from zero to \nthat appropriate at SMI. This would require detailed information that \ncould be obtained only from the simulations. As this transition phase is \nrather short, it appears that ignoring it can still give good approximations. \nREFERENCES \nR. M.
