This functional approach is necessary but there has been little \nexploration of a different paradigm, a conceptual approach towards research supervision.  This \npaper, based on interviews with supervisors from a range of disciplines, aims to fill this a gap.  The \nmain concepts identified are: Functional: where the issue is one of project management; \nenculturation: where the student is encouraged to become a member of the disciplinary community; \ncritical thinking: where the student is encouraged to question and analyse their work; emancipation: \nwhere the student is encouraged to question and develop themselves; and developing a quality \nrelationship: where the student is enthused, inspired and cared for.  Supervisors of doctoral students \nare also trying to reconcile the tensions between their professional role as an academic and their \npersonal self as well as encouraging students to move a long a path towards increasing \nindependence.  The concepts are examined in the light of each of these tensions.  Finally the \nresearch illuminates the power of the supervisor\u2019s own experience as a student and the paper \nsuggests that supervisors need to be aware of both the positive and negative aspects of each of these \nconceptual approaches. \n \n \nIntroduction \nWe know that the supervisor can make or break a PhD student.  More specifically the \ncommunication between the supervisor and student is key (Ives & Rowley 2005).  This paper looks \nat the influences on this partnership mostly from the supervisors\u2019 perspective.   \nMuch of the current literature concentrates on identifying the functions that the effective \nsupervisor needs to carry out, with occasional nods towards a parenting function.    Whilst the \nliterature on learning and teaching has explored a conceptual approach in some depth (eg Entwistle \n 2\n1997, Prosser and Trigwell 1999, Biggs 2003, Akerlind 2004) there has been little similar \nexploration for supervision (Pearson & Kayrooz 2004).  This report on a study of practices in an \nUK research intensive university is intended to begin to fill this gap.  It builds on the work of \nconceptualising research which was begun by Brew (2001) and Pearson and Brew (2002).  The \nconcepts that this paper proposes map on to their work and add a new dimension that of \u2018developing \na relationship\u2019. (Lee 2007). \nThis paper proposes that there are two key influences on the supervisors\u2019 approach to \nsupervision: firstly their concept of research supervision and secondly their own experience as a \ndoctoral student.   Understanding the implications of these conceptions could enable supervisors to \ndevelop a wider range of approaches, maximise the advantages and minimise the disadvantages of \neach category.  The paper also proposes widening the range of methodologies used to examine this \nissue. \nThe aim of this article is to explore what influences a supervisor\u2019s approach to their work \nwith doctoral students.  It proposes a framework of supervision which can be used in both for the \ndevelopment of individual supervisors and to create a language which those involved in co-\nsupervisory roles can use to negotiate and understand their respective roles.  The framework has \nbeen created through examining the literature on supervision through the filter of interviews with \nsupervisors (Lee 2007). \n \nThe framework is outlined below (Table 1).  \n \n Functional Enculturation Critical \nthinking \nEmancipation Relationship \nDevelopment \nSupervisors \nActivity \nRational \nprogression \nthrough tasks \nGatekeeping Evaluation \nChallenge \nMentoring, \nsupporting \nconstructivism \nSupervising by \nexperience, \ndeveloping a \nrelationship \nSupervisor\u2019s \nknowledge & \nskills \nDirecting, \nproject \nmanagement \nDiagnosis of \ndeficiencies, \ncoaching \nArgument, \nanalysis \nFacilitation, \nReflection \nEmotional \nintelligence \nPossible student \nreaction \nObedience \nOrganised \nRole modelling Constant \ninquiry, fight \nor flight \nPersonal growth, \nreframing \nEmotional \nintelligence \n \nTable 1:  A framework for concepts of research supervision \n \nAs it is used here the terminology of an \u2018academic concept\u2019 implies a definition and \ndescription of an approach, belief or experience about the nature of supervision which can then be \ncommunicated but which is also drained of its contextual links (Entwistle 2007).  This article begins \nto define the salient elements of these concepts so that readers can discern the key features.  It also \nbegins the exploration of the interconnections that create a firmer understanding of the over-arching \nconcept.  The words \u2018approach\u2019 and \u2018categories\u2019 are used in this paper to refer to the pragmatic \nlevel, the action informed by the concept.   \n \nLiterature Review  \nThere is much sensitive work written about how to supervise doctoral students (eg: Taylor and \nBeasley 2005, Wisker 2005, Cryer 1997) which has identified (ever increasing) lists of tasks for the \nsupervisor to undertake and some suggestions for anticipating and handling problems.  Whilst there \nhas been less qualitative research carried out on the topic there has been some sociological research \n(Delamont et al 2002).  This has identified the powerful impact of the supervisor\u2019s previous \nexperience as a PhD student on how they supervise now.  \n \nHow are doctoral students supervised? Concepts held by supervisors of doctoral research students.  \n An article prepared for the Journal of Studies in Higher Education. \u00a9 Dr Anne Lee 2007 a.lee@surrey.ac.uk   \n \n 3\n \nA phenomenological review of research provided a new discipline-neutral, framework for \nunderstanding research which proposed that experienced supervisors have views of research as \neither: a series of tasks (domino variation), a production orientation (trading variation), a series of \ntheories where the researcher is absent (layer variation) and an encounter where the researcher is \ntransformed (journey variation) (Brew 2001).     Brew argued that she had uncovered \u2018aspects of \nresearch which are often hidden from view but which influence research at every level\u2019 \nMeyer (2007) has looked at modelling postgraduate students\u2019 conceptions of research as \nanother way of exploring variation and identified eight conceptually discrete dimensions of \nvariation.  (Research as: information gathering; discovering the truth; insightful exploration and \ndiscovery; analytical and systematic enquiry; incompleteness; the re-examination of existing \nknowledge, identifying and solving problems; and a set of misconceptions.)  This modelling \napproach has not yet been applied to postgraduate supervision. \nThe anthropologist would combine interviews and observation data to try to close the gap \nbetween espoused-theory and theory-in-use (Argyris & Schon 1974).  In applying this approach to \nresearch in schools Foster (1996) argues that this approach could bridge the gap that has developed \nbetween qualitative and quantitative methodological approaches and rightly argues that there is a \nneed for a wide variety of methodological approaches to investigate educational phenomena.  \nPostgraduate supervision has essentially been a private act between consenting adults and pressure \nto open this to observation will raise hackles as well as ethical issues, but it could provide us with \nvery helpful data. \nThis article reports on a research approach where the literature and the interviews have \niteratively informed the development of the concepts.  The theoretical level of the work has been \ninformed by the reported practice of the interviewees and vice-versa.  This inevitably leads to some \nblurred boundaries between theory and practice, but I hope it also leads to a richer and more useful \nanalysis and description. \n \nMethod \nFurther details on the method are given in the definitive version of this article published in Studies \nin Higher Education.  Detailed interviews with twelve supervisors from a range of disciplines in a \nresearch intensive UK university were carried out.  (This data later was compared with interviews \nwith two PhD students and a discussion group of PhD students for further illumination and to check \nfor face validity).   The twelve supervisors ranged from those with over 20 years experience of \nworking with doctoral students to those who were still supervising their first students.   There were \nthree female and nine male supervisors. Between them they had experience of supervising over 150 \nPhD students both full and part time.  The students were studying a mixture of traditional PhDs and \nprofessional doctorates. \nA major finding was that the supervisors\u2019 own experiences (when they themselves were \nstudents) had significant impact on how they now supervise.  This means that this study also \nreflects a range of experiences from doctoral students at UK universities (including Oxford, \nLondon, Cardiff, Birmingham and Warwick) over the last 20 years.  \nThe supervisors were asked a range of questions about their experience of supervising PhD \nstudents.  These included asking them to describe what they actually did in their meetings, what \nthey expected students to do, what problems arose and how they were coped with, what their \nobjectives were and occupationally what their students have subsequently gone on to do. The \ninterviewees were then asked about their own experiences as a doctoral student.  Finally the \ninterviewees were invited to comment on the proposed approaches (see Table 1) to see if they were \naccepted for face validity and whether they could place themselves.   \n \n \nHow are doctoral students supervised? Concepts held by supervisors of doctoral research students.  \n An article prepared for the Journal of Studies in Higher Education. \u00a9 Dr Anne Lee 2007 a.lee@surrey.ac.uk   \n \n 4\nThese questions therefore concentrated on the \u2018what\u2019 and the \u2018why\u2019 of the experience of \nsupervision.  The aim was to understand how supervision is experienced and perceived. \nThe method of analysis was inspired by phenomenography (Ackerlind 2007) but this is not a \nphenomenographic piece of work.  An iterative analysis of the interview transcripts was carried out.  \nA random first transcript was used to create an initial coding and these codes were then added to, \namplified and amended by all the subsequent transcripts.  The approaches were then compared \nagain with the literature around each of these concepts. \n \n \nOutcomes and discussion \nAnalysis of the transcripts illuminated, redefined and reorganised the concepts first proposed from \nthe literature search, it also identified a series of tensions which supervisors try to reconcile and to \nwhich we will return. \nFive main approaches to supervision were identified which all link to the potential conflict \nbetween the academic and the personal self.  These approaches are not independent of each other. \n \n1. Functional: where the issue is one of project management \n2. Enculturation: where the student is encouraged to become a member of the disciplinary \ncommunity \n3. Critical thinking: where the student is encouraged to question and analyse their work \n4. Emancipation: where the student is encouraged to question and develop themselves \n5. Developing a quality relationship: where the student is enthused, inspired and cared for \n \nFunctional \nOf the five main approaches that were identified, the functional approach is the one which sits most \nclosely with the professional role of the academic. Many of the books written about effective \nsupervision are instruction manuals.  They are full of practical advice about interviewing, agreeing \nthe ground rules, introducing the student to new colleagues, project and time management, raising \nethical issues, transfer from M Phil to PhD, preparation for the viva etc.  (Whisker 2005, Eley and \nJennings 2005, Taylor and Beasley 2005).    \n \nThis is similar to the technical rational model which gives priority to issues of skills development \n(Wisker et al 2003 p 92).  The supervisor\u2019s task becomes one of directing and project management.   \n \nSupervisors who were interviewed explained their functional responsibilities with clarity and often \nbrevity. \n \n\u201cDay One I tell them: \u2018you have three years\u2019  They are given a schedule.  We are geared up \nfor 3 years and know what can reasonably be achieved in 3 years rather than what is a \ncomplete piece of work.  We have become more focussed.  People treat it like a 9-5 job.  You \nhave to do something that someone is prepared to pay for.\u201d \n  \n\u201cI have a weekly timetabled formal slot for them and follow-up if they do not turn up\u201d \n \n\u201c The timeframe is: the first 3 months are more relaxed to search and do the literature \nsurvey, by the end of the first 6 months the focus of the work is fixed, at the end of the first \nyear they will have completed their transfer report.  We pressurize everyone to get them \nthrough\u201d. \n \n \nHow are doctoral students supervised? Concepts held by supervisors of doctoral research students.  \n An article prepared for the Journal of Studies in Higher Education. \u00a9 Dr Anne Lee 2007 a.lee@surrey.ac.uk   \n \n 5\nThe requirement for students to be obedient was also evident here:  \n \n\u201cIn the 2nd year we see them monthly and they produce 5000 words before each meeting\u201d \n \nThe functional approach could be extended to manage a group of PhD students,  \n \n\u201cI organise regular pair or small group meetings with a supervisor where students present \nfindings\u201d  \n \nand although no interviewee confessed to doing this themselves, a couple of them admitted that the \nfunctional approach is a well worn path for numbers of students who were all carrying out pieces of \nresearch which are part of a larger grand plan  \n \n\u201cI know of places where there is a PhD factory\u201d \n \nThis type of comment was made by three interviewees and is an approach often attributed to the \nsciences.  Only one of the interviewees in this case was a pure scientist.  There are grounds for \nbelieving that it applies to an approach which can span the disciplines. \n \nEnculturation \nIn this perception achieving a PhD is about becoming a member of an academic discipline.  \n(Leonard 2001 p 98).  The supervisor\u2019s role in directing the student may become more apparent \nhere and there is an apprenticeship element included in this model.   \n \nConceptualising research communities as communities of practice enables us to look at the social \ndimensions of the research supervision model (Pearson and Brew 2002, Lave  & Wenger 1991).  \nThere are issues of acculturalisation into both the institution, the community of the discipline, the \ncountry\/civilisation and epistemological access.  \n \nThe supervisor may see themselves as being like the family doctor.  They will provide some \nspecific expertise but will also be a gatekeeper to many more learning resources, specialist opinions \nand networks. The supervisor can choose which gates to open, particularly in the early stages of the \nresearcher\u2019s life.  Within this understanding therefore, there is also an understanding of the power \nof the supervisor in its widest sense.  Not only is the researcher \u2018present\u2019 (Brew 2001) in this model, \nthe supervisor is also \u2018present\u2019 as well. \n \nThere is another aspect of the power dynamic that arises from the supervisor being gatekeeper to the \nqualification and the academic discipline: that of ownership (or even suppression) of the final result.  \nOriginal research can be dangerous in that it can undermine previously dearly held beliefs and \ncareers.  The struggle can be political on several levels.  The student needs to be aware of how \npowerful (or not) their supervisor is in the institution.  In the case of international students the \nsupervisor is also gatekeeper to an even bigger issue: the cultural context in which the degree is \nbeing taken (Wisker 2005 p 202).  There are opportunities for power games and argument about \nwho \u2018owns\u2019 the research and subsequent conference presentations and publications. \n \nThe student begins by being offered \u2018legitimate peripheral participation\u2019 \n \n \nHow are doctoral students supervised? Concepts held by supervisors of doctoral research students.  \n An article prepared for the Journal of Studies in Higher Education. \u00a9 Dr Anne Lee 2007 a.lee@surrey.ac.uk   \n \n 6\n\u201cI believe they need to get in the lab straight away, they learn more by doing practical work \nand then they will appreciate the literature.  Initially I will suggest tasks and introduce them \nto the technical staff and lay out what I want done to get them started.\u201d \n \n\u201cI give my book to all my students\u201d \n \n\u201cStudents need to know what \u2018good enough\u2019 looks like.\u201d \n \n\u201cI get them to do conference presentations and write proceedings, I go with them if they are \npresenting for the first time.\u201d \n \n \nThe supervisor aims to move to a point of independence, the objective is a \u2018mutual engagement, \njoint enterprise and a shared repertoire\u2019 (Cousin and Deepwell p 59): \n \n\u201cI ask are they safe to be let loose on the community because technically those with a PhD \nare in charge of their own research?\u201d \n \n\u201cI would feel I had failed if they did not stay in the field\u2026.my students all know their \nacademic \n grandfather\u201d \n  \nThe failure to move to independence causes anxiety: \n \n\u201cThe students you worry about are those who still turn to you in the viva looking for \nconfirmation that they are OK\u201d \n \n \nCritical thinking \nTraditionally this is the heart of the PhD supervision.  Brown and Freeman (2000 p 301) offer the \nfollowing definition:  \u2018critical thinking comes in many forms, but all possess a single core feature.  \nThey presume that human arguments require evaluation if they are to be worthy of widespread \nrespect.  Hence critical thinking focuses on a set of skills and attitudes that enable a listener or \nreader to apply rational criteria to the reasoning of speakers and writers.\u2019   \n \nStevenson and Brand (2006) point out that critical thinking is largely a western, secularist \nintellectual tradition, and we need to be sensitive to this when applying it in different cultures or to \nsome disciplines. \n \nIn practice this approach addresses such questions as what is the underlying conceptual framework, \nwhat are the arguments for and against, what has been considered and what has been left out.  \nWisker (2005) argues that practicing using the metalanguage of viva defence is a very useful \nsupervisory skill because it ensures that the student addresses gaps in knowledge, boundaries, and \nmethodology.  \n \nCritical thinking implies a \u2018researcher absent\u2019 process (Brew 2001, Pearson and Brew 2002) and is \nonly part of the model suggested by Barnett (1997) of \u2018critical being\u2019.  One version of this process \nhas been called \u2018Gentle Socratic Inquiry\u2019 (Jackson 2001).  The \u2018gentle\u2019 is inserted to counteract the \nimage of Socratic inquiry where the consummate lawyer cleverly manipulates his adversary into a \n \nHow are doctoral students supervised? Concepts held by supervisors of doctoral research students.  \n An article prepared for the Journal of Studies in Higher Education. \u00a9 Dr Anne Lee 2007 a.lee@surrey.ac.uk   \n \n 7\nposition of \u2018got you\u2019.  Whilst the common perception of the Socratic method is a methodical \nquestioning and cross-examining, peeling away layers of half-truths, exposing hidden assumptions, \nthe gentler Socratic method proposed by Jackson assumes a position of co-operative inquiry and \naccepts that there is no right answer. \n \nThis type of critical thinking model typically works through three stages:  \n\u2022 problematising \n\u2022 finding connections  \n\u2022 uncovering conceptions\/the shape of an answer \n \nSome writers support constructive controversy above gentleness.  Johnson and Johnson (2001) \nargue that more than 40 studies indicate that constructive inquiry produces higher achievement and \nretention than concurrence seeking debate.   \n \nThe early stages of encouraging critical thinking were evident amongst the interviewees: \n \n\u201cThey need to explain to me: \u2018why, what and how\u2019 \n \n\u201cI ask them to email me a question about their project every week\u201d \n \n\u201cI use \u2018magic\u2019 words to help them identify the thread in their argument eg arguably, \n conversely, unanimously, essentially, early on, inevitably etc \n \n\u201cI think my student is more geared up towards reporting than thinking. I told her to shift \ninto second gear.  Her thinking is there but it does not come out in her writing.  I am going \nto inspire her to be brave and give her some tips on how to present her data and make her \nvoice more distinctive.  I am going to encourage her to use fill in words such as \u2018conversely\u2019 \nto synthesise and structure thoughts\u201d \n \nThe movement towards independence is evident once again in this category \n \n\u201cI avoid dependency by getting them to think about some problems and giving them \nresources\u201d \n \n\u201cI want them to stand on their own feet and challenge the thinking\u201d \n \n\u201cMy tutor was not confrontational, she encouraged me to be critical of my own ideas\u201d \n \n\u201cMost students do make the leap from dogmatic to provisional thinking\u201d \n \n\u201cAt the end of the process I want the student to have the maturity to know when a good idea \nis worth following or not\u201d  \n \nEmancipation \nPearson & Kayrooz (2004) argue that research supervision is a facilitative process requiring support \nand challenge.  It involves providing educational tasks and activities which include: progressing the \ncandidature, mentoring, coaching the research project and sponsoring student participation in \nacademic practice.   This is similar to the journey conception identified by Brew (2001).   \n \n \nHow are doctoral students supervised? Concepts held by supervisors of doctoral research students.  \n An article prepared for the Journal of Studies in Higher Education. \u00a9 Dr Anne Lee 2007 a.lee@surrey.ac.uk   \n \n 8\n\u201cI want to know what their connection is with the research why are they asking this \nquestion? For student x it was not external research, it was quite existential.\u201d \n \nA defining question which can mark the line between the facilitation and enculturation model is: \n\u201chow much responsibility should the student or the supervisor take for arriving at the destination?\u201d  \nMentoring is a powerful concept in this arena (Pearson and Brew 2002). \n \nThere is much literature on mentoring in general and facilitation skills in particular (Lee 2006).  The \nmentor is usually seen as a non-judgemental adviser.  Mentoring builds upon Rogers\u2019 belief that self \nexperience and self-discovery are important facets of learning (Morton-Cooper and Palmer 2000). \n \nAcknowledging the dependency stage, supervisors would say \n\u201cI try to get them to admit and confront their problems\u201d \n \n\u201cI act as a bridge between the knowledge and the student and eventually they don\u2019t need \nme\u201d \n \nAgain there is acknowledgement that this is only a beginning. \n \n\u201cI am always waiting for that epiphany moment when they say \u2018no I don\u2019t agree\u2019.\u201d \n \n\u201cYou get a lot of satisfaction, you have facilitated that growth in them\u201d \n \nThe lack of need for control is what makes this category differ from enculturation \n \n\u201cAt the start you know a little bit more than them, but not much.  Your job as a supervisor is \nto get them to the stage of knowing more than you\u201d \n \n\u201cI want it to have changed how they see the world\u201d \n \n\u201cVery few of my students are doing it for an academic career, they want the intellectual \nrewards.  I want my students to have had adequate challenge and support to get that\u201d \n \nThe doctoral supervisor can be a mentor in two ways in this situation, responsible both for doctoral \nstudents and for overseeing probationary staff acting as a co-supervisor (Code of Practice for \nResearch Degrees 2000). \n \nRelationship development \nWisker et al (2003) argue that emotional intelligence and flexibility play a large part in working \nwith students through to successful completion.  There is some evidence that poor emotional \nintelligence, a mismatch in styles (such as when the student is still dependent but the supervision \nstyle is one of \u2018benign neglect\u2019) leads unsurprisingly to poor completion rates (Stanley and Beasley \n2005 p 69). \n \nThe need for a positive relationship was demonstrated again by Ives and Rowley (2005) in their \ninterviews of supervisor\/student dyads and in particular in their examination of relationships where \nthere was dissatisfaction.   They found that interruptions in the relationship caused students \nproblems.  In their work a good relationship did not necessarily imply friendship at the beginning, \nindeed they suggest that friendship can get in the way of a good supervisory relationship because it \n \nHow are doctoral students supervised?

The interviewees in this piece of research identified additional difficult \naspects of the friendship issue. \n \nThe more dependent side of this relationship rests on the supervisor taking the initiative.  It includes \na desire to enthuse, encourage, recognise achievement and offer pastoral support: \n \n\u201cResearch supervision is a very personal thing.  It is about relationships. If they don\u2019t have \nthe motivation you need to fire the imagination, it is different for different students\u201d \n \n\u201cI wanted to call my supervisor the moment I solved the tough maths\u201d \n \n\u201cthe more pastoral support of the supervisors was really important.  I remember being \nsurprised at how helpful they were.  This was as important in helping me to get through as \nany intellectual support\u201d \n \nFriendship at an early stage might cause difficulties, but after several years of close contact some \nsupervisors found it became inescapable.  There is also a pain associated with the relationship \ndimension. \n \n\u201cWe ended up being good friends, she (my supervisor) was only seven years older than me\u201d \n \n\u201cMy supervisors are lifelong friends. I am still angry with the student who passed and \ndropped off the end of the earth after five years working together\u201d \n \n\u201cI wish supervising was more like the critical thinking model \u2013 less concerned with the \nwelfare of the student \u2013 because when they stab you in the back it would hurt less.  I want to \nmake sure they have a good time.\u201d \n \nThe independent end of the relationship model was characterised by altruism. \n \n\u201cI really think my relationship with my supervisor opened my eyes.  It was the character of \nmy supervisor, it went beyond mere mentoring.  He was considered unconventional, a \nmaverick\u2026..My supervisor helped me with my writing but never pressed me to publish\u201d \n \nWithin this approach there are also issues relating to gender, caring and sexuality.  It was interesting \nto observe the warmth with which one supervisor hugged his PhD student on her return from \nholiday, but the communication was unspoken.  Delamont et al (2000) refer to the problems that can \narise when sexual relationships are entered into and suggest that the academic should follow the \nrules suggested by the medical profession in these cases.   Two quotations illustrating the gender \nand caring issues are below.    \n \n\u201cWomen tend to listen more and look at body language, rather than just listen to what is \nactually being said.  \u2018Everything is fine\u2019.  Women are better at caring, for example we will \ngo through the data and then ask \u2018what\u2019s the real problem?\u2019.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt is important that students feel cared for.  One of my students father died in their first \nyear.  My experience is that there are some students who have a series of problems.  When \nthis student arrived he first was so ill he could not attend the induction, then his father died, \n \nHow are doctoral students supervised?

It is \nan arena where training can raise awareness, enable the creation of professional boundaries and \nprevent problems arising. \n  \nThe tensions that PhD supervisors reported \nSupervisors report a variety of tensions which they were trying to reconcile.  These have been laid \nout along two dichotomies:  \n \nProfessional Role\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..Personal self  \n \nDependence \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. Independence. \n \nThe tension between professional role and personal self were characterised by the professional \nrequirement for completion versus a personal desire for quality.  There was the institutional \nrequirement to be a service provider to increasing numbers of doctoral students versus the desire to \nprovide a truly individual educational opportunity.  There is a disciplinary requirement to adhere to \nthe standards required and a personal desire to ensure that the student is successful and there is \nsometimes a tension between the academic member of staff\u2019s own career advancement and that of \nthe student. \n \nThe tensions between dependence and independence have been illustrated in each of the conceptual \napproaches above and are summarised in the table below: \n  \n \n  \nPROFESSIONAL ROLE                                                                 PERSONAL SELF \n \n Functional Enculturation Critical \nthinking \nEmancipation Relationship \nDevelopment \nDEPENDENCE Student needs \nexplanation of \nstages to be \nfollowed and \ndirection \nthrough them \nStudent needs to \nbe shown what to \ndo \nStudent learns \nthe questions \nto ask, the \nframeworks to \napply \nStudent seeks \naffirmation of self-\nworth \nStudent seeks \napproval \nINDEPENDENCE Student can \nprogramme \nown work, \nfollow own \ntimetables \ncompetently \nStudent can follow \ndiscipline\u2019s \nepistemological \ndemands \nindependently \nStudent can \ncritique own \nwork \nStudent \nautonomous.

All became more expansive and the approaches they described are \nmarked by the shaded area in Table 4.

This supports the \n \nHow are doctoral students supervised?

Supervisors would seek to emulate, add to or avoid their own experience. \nSome of the examples are in Table 3: \n \n \n \nSupervisor\u2019s own experience as a PhD student Current practice as a supervisor \nMy own PhD was a very lonely experience ..at lab meetings \nit became very evident, he (my supervisor) would show \nenthusiasm about everyone else\u2019s project and not mine \n.. the second advantage of groups is that everyone knows \nwhat is going on\u2026.when we have groups I make sure \nthat everyone is included \nThe door was always open.

When I wrote nonsense he asked me to resolve it \nrather than do it for me. \nI ask \u2018is this consistent with this\u2019 and leave it as a \nquestion for the student to resolve.  I will point out \ninternal inconsistency \nI was happy with my supervision but it was not \nconventional ... my supervisor encouraged me to read \nwidely, to think critically and find examples in newspapers.  \nI did not have to produce a chapter a meeting ...everything \nI wrote was scrutinised, there were 20 comments on every \nparagraph or page \nI am led by the example of my supervisor, but I would \nworry if someone did not produce something (in writing) \nfor 2 \u00bd years.  I have seen the advantage of structure \nand giving deadlines.  This supervisor also showed me \nthe extensive detailed written feedback he gives to his \nstudents. \nI would give (my supervisor) drafts of my chapters, \nsometimes I would just have a moan. \nI would like to ask my student \u2018is there anything I can do \nto make it easier for you\u2019? \nWhen I joined my supervisor gave me a book he had just \nwritten \nI do the same for my students \nI was enthused by my supervisor My students all know their academic grandfather \nMy supervisor was very dedicated to the subject.  It was \nhard to talk about anything but the subject.   \nAt the end of the day the student\u2019s intellectual \ndevelopment is the most important thing. \nI still bear the scars, there was very little supervision or \ninteraction.  No mentoring.  I had a disengaged supervisor \nwho was unable to understand what my project was about. \nI try to get my students to initiate, I tell them \u2018if I don\u2019t \nsee you I am going to fill my time up, I am going to \nforget about you, so I want you to ask me one question \nthat will tie me back into the project once a week. \n  \nTable 3:  Quotations illustrating a comparison of academics experiences as students and as \nsupervisors \n \nThe impact of that formative experience was felt particularly strongly in one or two approaches, not \nacross the board.  (This is shown by the shaded cells in Table 4 below). However, supervisors \nreported expertise and practice in more approaches than this.   \n \nIt would take a wider research approach to begin to untangle these layers in this situation, but when \ninterviewees were shown the list of approaches at the end of the interviews many of them identified \nthemselves quickly as falling into two of the categories (not necessarily the wider span of categories \nwhich they had described earlier in the interviews).  Most of the interviewees said that they \noperated in the functional approach plus one other. \n \nThe distribution of experience across categories \nHow experience was distributed across the four main categories (as reported by interviewees) is \nshown below.  (Table 4)  Where strong and easily identifiable statements were made about practices \nrelating to particular categories, the column is marked with an x.  The shaded areas refer to \ncomments relating to their own experience as a student.  O denotes a negative experience as a \nstudent. \n \n \nHow are doctoral students supervised?

This suggests that there may be a theory in use and an espoused theory Argyris \nand Schon (1974).  Whilst supervisors may be able to demonstrate a range of approaches, they may \nalso have a dominant or default position which is most powerfully experienced by their students. \nIn these cases, memories of a bad relationship seem to overshadow any experience of \nsupervision in other categories.  This small sample cannot be used to justify any disciplinary \ndifferences or similarities.  \n \n  Function Enculturation Critical thinking Emancipation Relationship \nDevelopment \nEngineering XX XX X  X \nEngineering X X X X O \nScience XXX X X  X \nScience XXX XXX   O \nTechnology XX XX    \nComputing X X X  XX \nSociology    XX XX \nPsychology XX XX X   \nEconomics   XX  X \nPhilosophy X  XX X O \nManagement studies X X XX X  \nManagement studies X   XX XX \n \nKey \nx Statement of approach clearly attributable to this category \nO Negative experience as a student \nx Positive experience of category as a student \n \nTable 4:  Distribution of statements relating to concepts \n \n \nConclusion \nThe impact of these approaches on existing students is worth further research, for example, does an \nenculturation approach encourage students to stay within the discipline and seek work within \nacademia?   \nAdditional interviews and discussions with groups of PhD students suggested that the five \nconcepts have a face validity with students as well as with supervisors.  Further research is needed \non this and the proposition that: whilst a supervisor might exemplify a range of conceptual \napproaches, the student experiences one or two predominant approaches.   \n \n \nHow are doctoral students supervised?

Both observation and \ninterviews will only give partial information and both are interpreted through the filter of the \nresearcher\/observer.  The interviews could not differentiate between the following: \n \n1. What I say I do (espoused theory) \n2. What I think I do \n3. What I do in practice (theory in use) \n \nI would like to propose that the concepts be further explored in terms of their advantages and \ndisadvantages for students and supervisors.
