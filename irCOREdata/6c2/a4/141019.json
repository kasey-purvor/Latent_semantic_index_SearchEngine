Fluid flow dynamics are often highly non-normal \u2014 that is their eigenvectors are closely aligned\n\u2014 and this characteristic is one factor that makes fluid systems hard to control. Traditionally, fluid\ndynamicists have assessed the stability of systems using Lyapunov\u2019s first method, paying little attention\nto the eigenvectors and the system sensitivity. For non-normal flows this leads to difficulties in resolving\nthe differences between measured and predicted flow instability [2]. Plane Poiseuille, or channel, flow is the\nunidirectional flow between two infinite parallel planes. This flow is laminar and stable for low Reynolds\nnumbers, but at high Reynolds numbers the flow becomes unstable resulting in turbulence. Experiments\nshow that the flow undergoes transition to turbulence for Reynolds number as low as 1000[3]. However,\neigenvalue predictions show the flow to be stable at Reynolds numbers below approximately 5772 [4]. The\nnon-normal nature of the dynamics makes the flow very sensitive. Hence an initial perturbation will grow\nto very large values before decaying. This can drive the system into regions where the non-linearities are\nsignificant and trigger turbulence.\nThe system dynamics can thus be considered as conditionally linear [5]. That is, the system can be\nconsidered linear provided the state remains within some region of the state space that is sufficiently\nclose to the steady state. In this paper, we explicitly consider the energy of perturbations (or transient\nenergy) which is a measure of the size of the perturbations of the state. It has a clear physical meaning and\n1\nis a fundamental notion in the study of turbulence and transition. Consequently, the maximum transient\nenergy growth following some energy-bounded initial state perturbation is often used as a performance\nmeasure for fluid flow systems, e.g. [6, 7].\nThe problem of controlling plane Poiseuille flow has received considerable attention. For example, optimal\nlinear quadratic methods have been considered by [7] and [8]. In these papers, the maximum transient\nenergy growth is considered in the analysis of the design, but not explicitly in the design formulation.\nState feedback control that can minimize an upper bound on the maximum transient energy growth\nfor plane Poiseuille flow is considered in [9]. However, state feedback is not available for fluid flow\nsystems. The actual maximum transient energy growth can, in principle, be minimized for the output\nfeedback problem[10], but the method is too computationally expensive for the Poiseuille flow problem.\nFurthermore it results in extremely high order controllers. Thus this paper considers two approaches that\nuse the Method of Inequalities[11] (MoI). In the first, the MoI is used to design low-order controllers,\nnamely proportional and PI controllers. In the second approach, the MoI is combined with McFarlane\nand Glover\u2019s H\u221e loop-shaping design procedure[12] in a mixed-optimization approach[13]. Preliminary\nresults of the study can be found in [14].\nA summary of the derivation of the state-space model is presented in the next section. This material can\nalso be found in [9], but is reproduced here for convenience. A more detailed exposition can be found\nin [15], and full details in [16]. Section 3 defines the maximum transient energy growth and proposes\nthat the control signal magnitude is measured in a similar way. The MoI and mixed optimization are\nintroduced in Sections 4 and 5 respectively. The design results are given in Section 6. Finally, comments\nand conclusions are provided.\n2 Plane Poiseuille flow\nIncompressible fluid flow is described by the Navier-Stokes and continuity equations. The Navier-Stokes\nequations\n~\u02d9U +\n(\n~U \u00b7 \u2207\n)\n~U = \u2212\n1\n\u03c1\n\u2207P +\n\u00b5\n\u03c1\n\u22072~U (1)\nform a set of three coupled, non-linear, partial differential equations representing Newton\u2019s second law\nwhere ~U is velocity, P is pressure, \u03c1 is density (uniform) and \u00b5 is viscosity (uniform), and the continuity\nequation\n\u03c1\u2207 \u00b7 ~U = 0 (2)\nis an additional constraint representing the conservation of mass.\n(Controller)\nPlane     \nPoiseuille\nFlow        Flow Disturbance\nLower\nWall \nUpper\nWall \nActuation\nSensing\nSpanwise, z\nWall\u2212normal, y\nStreamwise, x\nFigure 1: Plane Poiseuille flow.\n2\nThe control scheme is illustrated in Fig. 1. This shows Laminar Poiseuille flow with no slip occurring at\nthe bounding parallel planes, and which has a parabolic streamwise velocity profile. The flow undergoes\ntransition to turbulence when small perturbations ~u = (u, v, w), p about the steady base profile, ~Ub =\n((1 \u2212 (y\/h)2)Ucl, 0, 0), Pb, grow spatially and temporally to form a self-sustaining turbulent flow.\nThe Navier-Stokes equations written in terms of perturbations about the base flow, ~Ub, become\n~\u02d9u+ (~u \u00b7 \u2207) ~u+\n(\n~Ub \u00b7 \u2207\n)\n~u+ (~u \u00b7 \u2207) ~Ub = \u2212\n1\n\u03c1\n\u2207p+\n\u00b5\n\u03c1\n\u22072~u (3)\nIf it is assumed that the perturbations are small compared to the base flow, the second-order nonlinear\nterm, (~u \u00b7 \u2207) ~u, can be discarded. Non-dimensionalizing (3) by dividing length scales by the channel\nhalf-height h, dividing velocities by the base centreline velocity Ucl and dividing pressure by \u03c1U\n2\ncl, gives\n~\u02d9u+\n(\n~Ub \u00b7 \u2207\n)\n~u+ (~u \u00b7 \u2207) ~Ub = \u2212\u2207p+\n1\nR\n\u22072~u (4)\nwhere R := \u03c1Uclh\/\u00b5 is the dimensionless Reynolds number. The continuity equation, (2), is linear and\nso becomes\n\u2207 \u00b7 ~u = 0 (5)\nThe state of the flow can be determined from wall shear-stress or pressure measurements, and the flow can\nbe influenced by the manipulation of the conditions on its boundaries. In this work we assume that the\nshear-stress is measured and that the fluid is actuated by wall transpiration, which is the injection and\nsuction of fluid at the walls. Hence active feedback control of the evolution of transition is feasible. The\nproposed feedback controller scheme is shown in Fig. 1. However, (4) and (5) are infinite dimensional, so\nin order to be able to use standard finite dimension control methods, and to ensure that the controller is\npractically implementable, they must be approximated by a finite dimension linear time-invariant system\nof the form\nx\u02d9 = Ax+Bu\ny = Cx\n(6)\nHowever, a straightforward discretization results in a descriptor system with the form Ex\u02d9 = Ax + Bu\nwhere E is singular. This is a consequence of the algebraic constraint imposed by the continuity equation,\n(5), that does not contain pressure.\nTo proceed, the pressure perturbation term is eliminated from (4) by substituting (5) giving an expression\nfor the wall-normal velocity\n\u2202(\u22072v)\n\u2202t\n+ Ub\n\u2202(\u22072v)\n\u2202x\n\u2212\n\u22022Ub\n\u2202y2\n\u2202v\n\u2202x\n\u2212\n1\nR\n\u22072(\u22072v) = 0 (7)\nTo completely describe a three dimensional flow perturbation, a second equation is required to describe\nthe wall-normal vorticity, \u03b7, where\n\u03b7 =\n\u2202u\n\u2202z\n\u2212\n\u2202w\n\u2202x\n(8)\nand (4) and (5) give\n\u2202\u03b7\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202Ub\n\u2202y\n\u2202v\n\u2202z\n+ Ub\n\u2202\u03b7\n\u2202x\n\u2212\n1\nR\n\u22072\u03b7 = 0 (9)\nTo implement control by wall transpiration, the no-slip wall boundary conditions at y = \u00b11 are replaced\nby prescribed wall transpiration velocities, (u(\u00b11) = 0, v(\u00b11) 6= 0, w(\u00b11) = 0). Sensing of \u2202u\/\u2202y and\n\u2202w\/\u2202y is performed at the upper and lower walls, as these are related to the streamwise and spanwise wall\nshear-stresses respectively. Disturbances on ~u vary in the streamwise (x), wall-normal (y), and spanwise\n(z) directions. Variations in the wall-normal direction are assumed to be non-periodic and are represented\nby a modified Chebyshev series that fulfils the wall boundary conditions [17]. Variations in the streamwise\nand spanwise directions are assumed to have a periodic representation, \u211c(ei(\u03b1x+\u03b2z)), so flow disturbances\ngrow in time, but not in space. The terms \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the streamwise and spanwise wave numbers\n3\nrespectively. Substituting the assumed solutions into (7) and (9), and assuming an exponential time\nvariation results in the classical Orr-Sommerfeld and Squire equations respectively[6].\nAfter some manipulation of the equations, boundary control of the linearised Navier-Stokes equations in\na channel at a particular wave number pair, (\u03b1, \u03b2) (with associated variables denoted by u\u02dc, v\u02dc, etc), can\nbe represented as a linear state-space system in the standard form of (6). The linearised Navier-Stokes\nequations are evaluated atN locations in the wall-normal direction (with the locations more closely spaced\nnear the walls), and the state variables x are the Chebyshev coefficients of the wall-normal velocity, v\u02dc,\nand vorticity, \u03b7\u02dc, perturbations concatenated with the upper and lower wall v\u02dc transpiration velocities. For\ndetails, see [16].\nThe inputs, u, are the rates of change of upper and lower wall transpiration velocities. Since these are rates\nof change, the system contains two integrators, with eigenvectors representing upper and lower steady-\nstate transpiration from the walls. The measurements, y, are the wall shear-stress Fourier coefficients\non the upper and lower walls. The Chebyshev coefficients are complex, but the state-space system is\nmade real-valued by decomposing it into its real- and imaginary-valued parts, discarding the various null\nentries and thus leaving the state-space dimension the same size. The test case considered here is \u03b1 = 0,\n\u03b2 = 2.044, R = 5000. This test case is linearly stable but has the largest transient energy growth over\nall unit initial conditions, time and wave-number pairs, and represents the very earliest stages of the\ntransition to turbulence. The model is discretised in the wall-normal direction with N = 20. The order\nof the resulting model is 2N \u2212 2. A 38th order model is high for control purposes, but errors become\nsignificant at lower values of N [16].\n3 Transient energy growth\nConsider the asymptotically stable linear time-invariant system described by the initial value problem\nx\u02d9 = Ax, x(0) = x0, (10)\nwith A \u2208 Rn\u00d7n, x0 \u2208 R\nn which has the continuous solution x : R+ \u2192 R\nn, t 7\u2192 eAtx0.\nThe transient energy, E(t), is defined as\nE(t) = max\n{\n\u2016Wx(t)\u2016\n2\n: \u2016Wx(0)\u2016 = 1\n}\n, (11)\nwhere W > 0 is a constant weight matrix. The maximum transient energy growth, E\u02c6 , is defined as\nE\u02c6 := max {E(t) : t \u2265 0} . (12)\nNow consider the linear time-invariant plant\nx\u02d9(t) = Ax(t) +Bu(t), x(0) = x0,\ny(t) = Cx(t),\n(13)\nwith A \u2208 Rn\u00d7n, x(t) \u2208 Rn, B \u2208 Rn\u00d7\u2113, u(t) \u2208 R\u2113, C \u2208 Rm\u00d7n, y(t) \u2208 Rm with feedback controller\nx\u02d9k(t) = Akxk(t) +Bky(t), xk(0) = xk0,\nu(t) = Ckxk(t) +Dky(t),\n(14)\nwith Ak \u2208 R\nnk\u00d7nk , Bk \u2208 R\nnk\u00d7m, Ck \u2208 R\n\u2113\u00d7nk , Dk \u2208 R\n\u2113\u00d7m. The closed loop system is given by\nx\u02d9c(t) = Acxc(t), xc(0) = xc0 (15)\nwhere\nAc :=\n[\nA+BDkC BCk\nBkC Ak\n]\n, xc(t) :=\n[\nx(t)\nxk(t)\n]\n. (16)\n4\nThe maximum transient energy growth of the plant is\nE\u02c6 = max\n{\n\u2016Wx(t)\u2016\n2\n: \u2016Wx0\u2016 = 1, xk0 = 0, t \u2265 0\n}\n. (17)\nThe transient energy in the controller states is irrelevant to the problem under consideration because the\ncontroller can always be normalized by appropriate choice of controller state basis. This is the problem\nof controller state scaling, see [18] for example. Further details about transient energy growth in finite\ndimension linear systems can be found in [10].\nIn order to limit the amount of effort generated by the controller in a closed loop system, the maximum\ncontrol \u201ctransient energy growth\u201d is defined as\nU\u02c6 := max\n{\n\u2016u(t)\u20162 : \u2016Wx0\u2016 = 1, xk0 = 0, t \u2265 0\n}\n, (18)\nwhere u = [DkC Ck]xc.\n4 The Method of Inequalities (MoI)\nIn the MoI [11], the control design problem is expressed as a set of algebraic inequalities that need to be\nsatisfied for a successful design. The design problem is expressed as\n\u03c6i(p) \u2264 \u01ebi for i = 1 . . . n, (19)\nwhere \u01ebi are real numbers, p \u2208 P is a real vector (p1, p2, . . . , pq) chosen from a given set P and \u03c6i are real\nfunctions of p. The design goals \u01ebi are chosen by the designer and represent the largest tolerable values\nof the objective functions \u03c6i. The aim of the design is to find a p that simultaneously satisfies the set of\ninequalities.\nA solution to the set of inequalities, (19), is obtained by means of numerical search algorithms. Generally,\nthe design process is interactive, with the computer providing information to the designer about conflicting\ndesign requirements, and the designer adjusting the inequalities to explore the various possible solutions\nto the problem. The progress of the search algorithm should be monitored, and, if a solution is not\nfound, the designer may either change the starting point, relax some of the design goals \u01eb or change the\ndesign configuration. Alternatively, if a solution is found easily, to improve the quality of the design,\nthe design goals could be tightened or additional design objectives could be included in (19). The\ndesign process is thus a two way process. The MoI provides information to the designer about conflicting\ndesign requirements, and the designer makes decisions about the \u2018trade-offs\u2019 between design requirements.\nFurther details on numerical algorithms can be found in [11, 19, 20, 21].\nThe functions \u03c6i(p) are typically functionals of the system step response, for example the rise-time,\novershoot or the integral absolute error, or functionals of the frequency response, such as the bandwidth.\nFor the Poiseuille flow control problem they are taken as the maximum transient energy growth and\nthe maximum control transient energy growth. To ensure these are finite, the system must be closed-\nloop stable and so a measure of the system stability needs to be included. One suitable measure is the\nmaximum real part of the closed-loop eigenvalues\n\u03b10 = max\ni\n{\u211c(\u03bbi(Ac))} (20)\nwhere {\u03bbi} represents the set of eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix, Ac. Generally, the design\nparameter, p, parameterizes a controller with a particular structure (e.g. [22]) rather than the state space\nstructure of (14). For example, p = (p1, p2) could parameterize a P+I controller p1+p2\/s. Because state\nspace realizations are over-parameterized, this ensures a smaller dimension of the search space, P .\nThe Poiseuille flow control problem can be formulated as follows:\nProblem 1. Find a p \u2208 P and hence a K(p) such that\n\u03b10(p) \u2264 \u01eb\u03b1, (21)\nE\u02c6(p) \u2264 \u01ebE\u02c6 , (22)\nU\u02c6(p) \u2264 \u01ebU\u02c6 , (23)\n5\nwhere \u01eb\u03b1, \u01ebE\u02c6 , and \u01ebU\u02c6 are prescribed tolerable values of \u03b10, E\u02c6, and U\u02c6 respectively.\n5 Mixed optimization\nW1(s)\nKs(s)\nG(s)\nW2(s)\n-\nff\n-\nff\nFigure 2: Controller configuration for LSDP\nThe MoI can be combined with analytical optimization techniques in a mixed optimization approach\nby using the parameters of the weighting functions generally required by such techniques as the design\nparameters [13, 23, 24]. Here, we use McFarlane and Glover\u2019s loop-shaping design procedure (LSDP)\n[12].\nThe LSDP maximizes robust stability to perturbations on the normalized coprime factors of a plant, G(s),\nweighted by pre- and post-compensatorsW1(s) andW2(s) as shown in Fig. 2. An explicit controller K(s)\nfor optimal \u03b3\n\u03b30 = inf\nK\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\n[\nW\u221211 K\nW2\n]\n(I \u2212GK)\u22121\n[\nW\u221212 GW1\n]\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\n\u221e\n(24)\ncan be synthesized, the weights having been simply incorporated into the optimal controller Ks(s) so\nthat K = W1KsW2.\nThe problem can be formulated as the MoI as follows:\nProblem 2. For the system of Fig. 2, find a p \u2208 P and hence a (W1,W2)(p) and K such that\n\u03b30(p) \u2264 \u01eb\u03b3 , (25)\nE\u02c6(p) \u2264 \u01ebE\u02c6 , (26)\nU\u02c6(p) \u2264 \u01ebU\u02c6 , (27)\nwhere (W1,W2)(p) is a pair of fixed order weighting functions with real parameters p = (p1, p2, . . . , pq)\nand \u01eb\u03b3 , \u01ebE\u02c6 , and \u01ebU\u02c6 are prescribed tolerable values of \u03b30, E\u02c6, and U\u02c6 respectively.\n6 Results\n6.1 Open loop\nThe transient energy E(t) of the linearized system with no wall transpiration control is shown in Fig. 3.\nThe maximum transient energy growth is E\u02c6 = 4941.\n6.2 Low order controllers\nThe design goals are set at\n\u01eb\u03b1 = \u22121\u00d7 10\n\u22125, (28)\n\u01eb\nE\u02c6\n= 1000, (29)\n\u01eb\nU\u02c6\n= 1.

The state feedback controllers obtained in [9] gave a value of E\u02c6 = 883. This is considerably\nlower than the best value obtained in this study of E\u02c6 = 2690.5 for the PI controller. This indicates\nthe difficulties in state estimation for this system. The optimal H\u221e was unable to improve on the PI\ncontroller and was actually greater. However, the performance of the transient energy was significantly\nbetter for earlier times. With an increase in computational power, the convex optimization methods of\n[10] could be applied to this problem and determine what is the minimal E\u02c6 and whether a solution exists.\nThe problem of model order reduction for the maximum transient energy growth problem would aid the\ndesign of optimal controllers, but that is a topic for further study.\nProportional control performed by [7] achieves a lower transient energy growth. However the model\nactuates by wall-normal velocity, rather than rate-of-change of wall-normal velocity. More recent work\nindicates that control by rate-of-change of velocity results in greater accuracy when modelling flow control\nfor plane Poiseuille flow due to improved treatment of the Neumann boundary conditions and energy\nweighting matrix W [15, 8]. Note also that the design of low-order controllers for the problem of plane\nPoiseuille flow has been considered before [25] but but not the explicit consideration of the maximum\ntransient energy growth. Similarly, McFarlane and Glover\u2019s LSDP has been used for a spatially growing\nchannel flow [26], but transient energy growth was also not explicitly considered.\nReferences\n[1] S.
