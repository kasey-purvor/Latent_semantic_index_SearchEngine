Buschmann and Gad-el-Hak \n(2007) review the use of scaling laws for turbulent boundary layers, demonstrating that a \nuniversally applicable functional is lacking, with neither power law nor logarithmic \nbehaviours being ruled out. Under certain conditions, the boundary layer inner region is \ndescribed by a logarithmic profile by von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n (1954). Its outer region is described by a \ndefect velocity approach. Coles (1956) combined these two analytical descriptions into a \nsingle formulation, the law of the wake. Following this approach, several variants of this law \nhave been published by Moses (1964), Finley et al. (1966), Granville (1976), Dean (1976), \nLewkowicz (1982), and Guo et al. (2005). \nThe state-of-art in that of a law of the wake raises two issues. First, how do the above \nmentioned formulations compare with each other, and second, why does the law of the wake \nnot remove the presence of two concurrent length scales in the velocity profile, namely the \nboundary layer thickness \u03b4 in the outer region, with its corresponding free-stream velocity u\u221e, \nand the viscous length scale \u00b5\/u\u03c4 in the inner region, with its corresponding friction velocity \nu\u03c4, with \u00b5 = laminar viscosity. This research addresses both issues by introducing a novel \nscaling for the outer layer (y*,u*), where the defect velocity region and the logarithmic portion \nof the profile are projected on an unified non-dimensional reference system. The scaling \ndepends on the value of the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n parameter k and the smooth wall parameter B. \nKrogstad et al. (1992) determined k and B empirically by regressing measured velocity \nprofiles. Following their approach, this work presents regressed values of k, B, and of the \nwake parameter \u03a0 over the boundary layer thickness-based Reynolds number range of 145 \u2264 \nR \u2264 13030, where R = \u03b4u\u03c4\/\u03bd. These give velocity profiles by the law of the wake of Finley et \nal. (1966) within \u00b12% of the measurements. \nPage 2 of 10 \n \n \n2 Unifying laws of the wake \n2.1 Classical formulations \n \nBased on the existence of a region of overlap between the inner region of the turbulent \nboundary layer, described by the law of the wall  \n \nu+=f(y+),        (1) \n \nand its outer region, described by the velocity defect law \n \n1\u2212u\/u\u221e=f(\u03b7),       (2) \n \nColes (1956) proposed the additive function \n \nu+=k-1lny++B+\u03a0k-1f(\u03b7),      (3) \n \nwhere u+ = u\/u\u03c4, y+ = yu\u03c4\/\u03bd, \u03b7 = y\/\u03b4, where y = wall-normal distance, and \u03a0 = wake parameter \ndetermined by  \n \n\u03a0=0.5 k(u+\u221e\u2212k\u22121ln R \u2212 B).

(1966) satisfy \n \nu=u\u221e at y=\u03b4       (10) \n \nThe defect laws by Lewkowicz (1982), Moses (1964), and Finley et al. (1966) satisfy \n \n\u2202u\/\u2202y(y=\u03b4)=0        (11) \n \nIn an actual turbulent boundary layer, the mean velocity profile approaches Eqs. (10) and (11) \nasymptotically, with a rate that is strongly influenced by the free-stream turbulence level \n(Gostelow 2009). It is established practice to define \u03b4 in experiments at about 0.99u\u221e and to \nneglect the small velocity defect above it. For instance, Granville (1976) used 0.9969u\u221e and \nPage 3 of 10 \n \n0.998u\u221e for fitting his law of the wake to the experimental data. The same simplification is \nadopted in the data fitting of section 3, by which the velocity defect above a reference \u03b4 is set \nto zero and \u03b4 is taken to match a desired finite input value. \n \n2.2 Conformal mapping approach \n \nLet the solution of \n \n(\u2202u+\/\u2202y+)=(ky+)\u22121,      (12) \n \nwith u+ defined by Eqs. (3) and (9), be y+crit Substituting Eq. (12) into Eq. (3) and using f(\u03b7) \nfrom Eq. (9), then \n \ny+crit =R(\u03a0+1\/6)\/(\u03a0+1\/4),      (13) \n \nwith y+crit = point where the distance of Eq. (3) from the logarithmic law of the wall u+=k\u22121 \nlny++B is maximum (Jones et al. 2001). Its physical meaning may be expressed as the \nlocation where the effect of the dominant outer layer mixing over that of the inner layer-\ndriven viscous dissipation is a maximum. In other words, the mean velocity profile at y+crit is \nessentially determined by the convective processes in the outer layer and the influence of \nviscosity is weak. \nConsider the transformation \n \n(y*= y+\/y+crit, u*= u+\u2212k\u22121 lny+crit),    (14) \n \nFor u* to be real, y+crit > 0. Imposing y+crit > 0 in Eq. (13) gives \u03a0 > \u22121\/6. Equation (3), \nexpressed in terms of the new variables (y*,u*) from Eq. (14), with f(\u03b7) from Eq. (9), is \n \nu*= k\u22121 lny*+B+ k\u22121 (\u03a0+1\/6)2(\u03a0+1\/4) \u22122(y*)2(3\u22122y*). (15) \n \nUsing Eqs. (3) and (6) in Eq. (12), the root of the latter is y+crit =R. Substituting this in Eq. \n(14) and then in Eq. (3) with Eq. (6) results in \n \nu*= k\u22121 lny*+B+ 2\u03a0k\u22121 (y*)2(3\u22122y*).    (16) \n \nSimilarly, substituting Eqs. (3) and (8) in Eq. (12) gives y+crit =R\u03a0\/(\u03a0+1\/12). Substituting \nthis in Eq. (14) and then in Eq. (3) with Eq. (8), this becomes \n \nu*= k\u22121 lny*+B+ k\u22121\u03a0 2(\u03a0+1\/12) \u22122(y*)2(3\u22122y*).  (17) \n \nComparing Eqs. (15), (16) and (17), the transformation of Eq. (14) is seen to project the laws \nof the wake of Coles, Moses and Finley et al. so that, in (y*,u*) coordinates, the three laws are \nidentical but a constant. The form of the three laws is that of Coles equation (3), with (y*,u*) \nin place of y+, u+ and y\/\u03b4. \nHaving determined a common functional in (y*,u*) coordinates enables to see the three \nlaws of the wake as belonging to the same class. It also enables to study what key elements \nmake them different from each other. The three laws use different values of y+crit. This \nsuggests that in Coles\u2019 law re-stated as Eq. (16), where y+crit =R, the viscous effects on the \nmean velocity profile decrease monotonically to the boundary layer edge, at y+=R, while \nPage 4 of 10 \n \nmomentum transport effects have the opposite trend. In Eq. (15), the re-statement of Finley et \nal.\u2019s law, transport effects over viscous effects reach a maximum below the boundary layer \nedge R, for instance, y+crit = 0.89R for \u03a0=0.5. In the re-stated Moses\u2019 law of Eq. (16), this \nmaximum occurs further down the boundary layer, for instance, at y+crit = 0.86R for \u03a0=0.5. \n \n3 Validation \n3.1 Predictions of outer layer velocity profile at various R \n \nEquation (3), with f(\u03b7) from Eq. (9), was fitted to a range of streamwise velocity data (Spalart \n1988, Erm and Joubert 1991, Graaff and Eaton 2000, \u00d6sterlund 1999) from turbulent \nboundary layers under zero pressure gradient over the range 145 \u2264 R \u2264 13,030. The values of  \nu+\u221e and R are given by the above authors and are reported in Table 2. Note that k, \u03a0, and B \nare unknown parameters to be determined by regression, as by Krogstad et al. (1992). \n \nTable 2 Velocity profiles from experiment and direct numerical simulation \nR\u03b8 R u+\u221e \u03a0 k Symbol \n300 145 18.25 0.253 0.390 \u25e6 \n697 335 20.25 0.227 0.411 * \n1003 460 21.5 0.321 0.415 \u2206 \n1430 640 22.4 0.308 0.393 . \n2900 1192 24.33 0.357 0.390 \u25c4 \n3654 1365 25.38 0.575 0.402 \u00d7 \n5200 2000 26 0.490 0.406 \u25ba \n12633 4436 28.62 0.635 0.404 \u25a1 \n13000 4770 28 0.484 0.412 \u25ca \n22845 8000 30.15 0.615 0.407 + \n31000 13030 30 0.383 0.419 \uf0b6 \n \nFigure 1a shows the non-dimensional mean streamwise velocity defect (1\u2212u\/u\u221e) versus \nnon-dimensional wall distance \u03b7. The symbols used are given in Table 2 and denote values \nfrom experiment and direct numerical simulation. An incremental vertical shift of (1\u2212u\/u\u221e) = \n0.50 was applied to all curves for clarity and the 0 label on the ordinate of Fig. 1a refers to the \nR = 145 curve. The experimental data almost collapse on each fitted curve, suggesting that \nthe curve fit has captured most of the u+ dependence on \u03b4, u\u221e, u\u03c4, and R. \nThe quality of the data fit was further investigated as by Buschmann and Gad-el-Hak \n(2007) by evaluating the Fractional Difference (FD), defined as \n \nFD=100k(u+a\u2212u+e)\/(lny+i)      (18) \n \nwhere u+a = value given by Eq. (3), with f(\u03b7) from Eq. (9), and u+e = corresponding measured \nvalue for a given y+i in a discretized velocity profile of N points. Buschmann and Gad-el-Hak \n(2007) computed FD for a range of exponential and logarithmic laws. Figure 1b shows FD \nfrom Eq. (3), with f(\u03b7) from Eq. (9), following Buschmann and Gad-el-Hak (2007). \nOver the range 30 \u2264 y+ \u2264 R, over which k and \u03a0 were optimized, Fig. 1b shows that the \nfitted velocity data are within \u00b12% of the measured values. Multiple crossings of the FD = 0 \nline indicate the absence of a systematic u+ under-prediction or over-prediction over this y+ \nrange, for all Reynolds numbers tested R. If y+ < 30, the law of the wake (3), with f(\u03b7) from \nEq. (9), does not follow the experimental profile through the laminar sub-layer, where u+ = \nPage 5 of 10 \n \ny+, which is a known feature of the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n law of the wall. \uf020 This gives a rising FD as y+ \n< 30, as in most of the logarithmic laws reviewed by Buschmann and Gad-el-Hak (2007). In \nFig. 1b, the lighter curves denote the lower reference Reynolds numbers, as in Buschmann \nand Gad-el-Hak (2007). Over the range 30 \u2264 y+\u2264 R, there appears not to be a clear Reynolds \nnumber trend in the FD error from the even placement of all curves about the FD = 0 axis. \nFigure 1c shows the fitted velocity profiles of Fig. 1a without the vertical shift. In this \nfigure, the symbols of Table 2 label each curve by its reference Reynolds number. Plotting \nthe velocity profiles in defect velocity form shows a good scaling of the outer region, where \nall curves collapse as \u03b7\u21921. The curves are shown to satisfy the boundary conditions of Eqs. \n(10) and (11) as \u03b7\u21921. At \u03b7<1, the curves depart among each other, with the higher Reynolds \nnumber profiles having a more pronounced concavity and a correspondingly lower velocity \ndefect. \nFigure 2a shows the fitted wake parameter \u03a0 versus the free-stream Reynolds number, \nfrom the regression method by Krogstad et al. (1992). A least-squares linear regression is \napplied to \u03a0, from which its standard deviation is obtained. Assuming the differences in \u03a0 \nare normal, independent, with constant variance, the 50% confidence interval band for \u03a0 is \nplotted in Fig. 2a. A positive correlation between \u03a0 and the free-stream Reynolds number is \nshown in Fig. 2a. The width of the 50% confidence interval band is narrower than the \nregressed variation of \u03a0 over the range 145 \u2264 R \u2264 13030, indicating that the regressed \u03a0 \ntrend is significant. \nUsing the method by Krogstad et al. (1992), a similar linear regression was performed for \nthe fitted von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n constant k versus the free-stream Reynolds number, indicating a \npositive correlation between k and the freestream Reynolds number. \uf020 This inference is at odds \nwith the inverse correlation for k of Barenblatt et al. (2000) and is further mitigated by the \nrelatively large standard deviation for k, namely 0.0095 \u2264 \u03c3 0.5(k) \u2264 0.011, as obtained by \nregression. \uf020The significant standard deviation in k motivates further work, as suggested by \nBarenblatt et al. (2000), for a more complex, Reynolds number-dependent scaling law for the \nlogarithmic portion of the velocity profile. \n \n \nPage 6 of 10 \n \n101 102 10 3 104 105\n-2\n2\n6 (b)\ny +\nFD\n in\n %\n \n \nFigure 1 Fitting velocity profiles to measurements over the range 134 \u2264 R \u2264 13,030 (a) \nProfiles from experiment and direct numerical simulation in Table 2, lines by Eq.

(14).\uf020Just like with (y+,u+) and (y\/\u03b4, u\/u\u221e), the normalization (y*,u*) aims to \ncollapse the experimental velocity data on a single profile, without any zone restriction. y+crit \nin Eq. (14) is univocally defined and a function of the wake parameter and the normalized \nboundary layer thickness. It is computed from Eq. (13) using R from experiment and direct \nnumerical simulation and using \u03a0 regressed following Krogstad et al. (1992). \nFigure 2b shows the experimental velocity profiles in the logarithmic coordinates of Eq. \n(14). The projection shows an appreciable data collapse in the logarithmic profile region, \nover the range 0.2 \u2264 y* \u22641.0, above the viscous sub-layer that is not modelled by the law of \n10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 \n0.2 \n0.4 \n0.6 \n0.8 \nR \n(a) \n\u03a0\n \nPage 8 of 10 \n \nthe wake.\uf020 Above y*=1.0, the velocity profiles asymptote to different values of the normalized \nfree-stream velocity u*\u221e, as in the conventional (y+,u+) scaling (Buschmann and Gad-el-Hak \n2007).\uf020However, the profiles about y*=1.0 are stacked parallel to one another, following \nessentially the same trend. This positive result derives from the new scaling (y*,u*) that uses \nR and u+\u221e as scaling parameters. Since R = f(u\u03c4\/\u03bd,\u03b4) and u+\u221e = u\u221e\/u\u03c4, these parameters embed \nboth the inner and the outer scaling of Eqs. (1) and (2), upholding the fundamental notion of \nthe classical inner, outer, and the overlap regions, where the inner scaling of Eq. (1) and the \nouter scaling of Eq. (2) apply. \nBarenblatt et al. (2000), Chauhan et al. (2005) and Nagib and Chauhan (2008) proved \nthat the value of k and B are Reynolds number dependent. As both are used to define y+crit in \nEq. (13), their Reynolds number-dependence affects the data collapse. Still, the data fit \nshown in Figs. 1a and 2b by an appropriate regression of k and \u03a0 is useful for modelling \nboundary layers at Reynolds numbers commonly encountered in engineering practice. \n \n4 Conclusions \n \nA new non-dimensional coordinate system (y*,u*) has been defined, which projects the time-\naveraged velocity profiles of the inner and outer regions of a turbulent boundary layer on the \nsame non-dimensional plane. This enables a unified treatment of these two regions. The three \nlaws of the wake considered herein are identical but a constant. This transformation \nhighlights the commonality between these laws, offering a unified coordinate system in \nwhich their dependence on the common scaling parameter y+crit was studied. A preliminary \ninterpretation of the physical meaning of y+crit is given, based on the known flow physics in \nthe turbulent boundary layer outer region. Through conformal mapping, the variety of \ndifferent analytical approximations for a turbulent velocity profile in the literature may be \nordered, albeit this is currently limited to laws of the wake of logarithmic form. This may \nhelp the on-going search for a physics-based unified analytical description of the time-\naveraged turbulent boundary layer velocity profile. \nThe law of the wake of Finley et al. was used to regress experimental mean velocity \nprofiles over a relatively wide Reynolds number range of 145\u2264 R \u2264 13,030. By optimizing \nthe law of the wake closure coefficients k and \u03a0 using an appropriate norm, the formulation \nshows to be a good fit to the measurements if y+\u2265 30, with a fractional difference error of \n\u00b12% that is comparable to previous work. \nTabulated values of k and \u03a0 enable the practical use of the fitted laws of the wake as \ninput to computational fluid dynamic simulations at the test Reynolds numbers. The benefits \nof using this approach is that R and u+\u221e, which are typically used in computational fluid \ndynamics to specify a desired wall-bounded inflow state, can be matched explicitly rather \nthan by iteration. The correlations of the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n constant and the wake parameter with \nthe free-stream Reynolds number display a significant standard deviation for k. This requires \nattention if attempting to interpolate k and \u03a0 to obtain time-averaged velocity profiles at \nReynolds number different than these tested. \n \nAcknowledgement \n \nThis research project was supported by a Marie Curie Early Stage Research Training \nFellowship of the European Community\u2019s Sixth Framework Programme under contract \nnumber MEST CT 2005 020301. \n \nNotations  \nB Logarithmic law constant \nPage 9 of 10 \n \nk  von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n constant \nN  Number of points in experimental velocity profiles \nR  Reynolds number \nu  Streamwise velocity component \nu\u03c4  Wall friction velocity \ny Wall-normal distance \n\u03b4 Boundary layer thickness \n\u03b8  Momentum thickness \n\u03bd  Kinematic viscosity \n\u03a0  Wake parameter \n \nSubscripts \na  Analytical prediction \ncrit Maximum difference value between log-law and law of the wake \ne Measured value \n\u221e Free-stream value \n \nSuperscripts \n+ Normalized value in wall units \n* Normalized value by Eq.
