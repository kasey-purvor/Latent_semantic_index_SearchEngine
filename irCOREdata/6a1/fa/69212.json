Renewed interest in traditional knowledge also flows from the discourses of\nsustainable development and biodiversity conservation.1\nTraditional knowledge has always been available to the larger world, but in re-\ncent years its fate becomes problematic. Advances in biogenetics, accompanied by\nthe global marketing of drugs derived from indigenous usage, have multiplied the\npotential commercial value of flora. Developments in ethnobotany and medical\nbotany have produced a potentially heady brew for the pharmaceutical industry.\nAs flora acquires commercial value, there is a risk of its overexploitation, leading\nto extinction of species and loss of biodiversity. Exploitation is also a challenge to\nthe continued traditional use of indigenous knowledge and thereby threatens the\nsocial integrity of indigenous peoples\u2014perhaps leading to a loss of human diversity.\nThe growing appropriation of traditional knowledge throws up a number of\npolitical, environmental, legal, and ethical issues. For example, it draws new at-\ntention to intellectual property law: Are private property rights over biogenetic\nknowledge justifiable? How should society balance public versus private control\nover the intellectual commons of nature? Can an indigenous culture survive in\nthe face of market forces disembedding its knowledge of nature?2\nThere is a central contradiction involved in the fate of traditional knowledge:\nthe disjuncture between the present status of indigenous peoples and the charac-\nter of their traditional knowledge. In terms of their contemporary social, eco-\nnomic, and political status, many nomadic indigenous peoples around the globe,\nas a result of increasing contact with the postcolonial world, are or are becoming\nsedentary agriculturalists and semiproletarian farm laborers. However, their knowl-\nedge base remains substantially rooted in their original livelihoods. Thus, indig-\nenous peoples struggle to find a way to use and protect their traditional knowledge\nin changed circumstances.\nTo address the fate of traditional knowledge, this article focuses on its current\nstatus, particularly in relation to international property (IP) law. Specifically, we\naddress the inferior and alienated position traditional knowledge occupies relative\nto scientific knowledge within the discourse of intellectual property rights (IPRs).\nTraditional knowledge fares better in sociological and feminist discourses, which\nfocus on identifying the common nuances which can serve to bridge scientific and\ntraditional worldviews.3 Our approach is similarly focused on bridging this gap.\nWe argue that to protect traditional knowledge from further exploitation or ex-\ntinction it is important to contextualize Western science and traditional knowl-\nedge. We argue that Western European science is a particular, standardized form\nof local knowledge produced by the scientific revolution of the seventeenth cen-\ntury. It was then universalized through colonialist and capitalist practices of knowl-\nedge production and ownership. During this period traditional knowledge was\ndefined as a product of witchcraft, superstition, and heresy. It was marginalized\nand its social value was considerably undermined. Beginning under late colonial-\n202 SASKIA VERMEYLEN, GEORGE MARTIN & ROLAND CLIFT\nism, field research by ecologists, anthropologists, and others helped to reestablish\nits academic credibility. In recent years this process of renewal of traditional knowl-\nedge may have reached a new stage. Western scientists who led this effort did so\nwithin a historic atmosphere of colonial derision and neglect. In their struggle to\nreestablish traditional knowledge, they stressed its unique nature.\nAt the current juncture, in which indigenous peoples are striving to reestablish\nrights over their traditional knowledge in national and international forums, the\nemphasis on its uniqueness can be counterproductive. In contrast, in other dis-\ncourses, such as science and technology studies (STS), traditional and scientific\nknowledge can be conceptualized as local knowledges. Actor Network Theory can\nbe used to connect the various modes of knowledge production in assemblages.\nWe suggest that the application of the logic of assemblages has implications for\nIPR.\nAlthough this article explores conceptual definitions of knowledge, it has been\ninspired and informed by empirical research carried out with the San in Southern\nAfrica (July\u2013November 2004, July\u2013September 2005, June\u2013August 2007). This re-\nsearch was part of a larger project that examined the San\u2019s stance toward IPR and\nthe commercialization of their traditional knowledge, which was sparked by the\nhoodia benefit-sharing agreement. The San of the Kalahari have chewed the suc-\nculent, Hoodia gordonii, for millennia on long hunts. It is a thirst quencher and\nappetite suppressant. A patent was awarded to South Africa\u2019s Council for Scien-\ntific and Industrial Research in 1998 without the knowledge and consent of the\nSan. After a campaign for their rights, a deal was struck so that the San could\nbenefit from the commercialization of the slimming aid, P57, the active ingredient\ndeveloped from hoodia.4\nTRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND INTERNATIONAL LAW\nIntellectual property rights draws attention to a central question: How does one\ndefine traditional knowledge? Even scholars who have devoted careers to studying\nnon-Western knowledge systems struggle to define traditional knowledge.5 The\ninstitutions6 looking for appropriate protection mechanisms for traditional knowl-\nedge are failing to provide terminological clarity.7 Amid this definitional uncer-\ntainty, one strand of scholars (mostly anthropologists) has argued that traditional\nknowledge belongs to specific ethnic groups or the cultural heritage of minority\ngroups.8 Framing traditional knowledge in this manner (i.e., as something con-\nnected to a particular space, time, and people) is a continuation of the need to\ndifferentiate it from Western or scientific knowledge, which is seen as a cause for\nits exploitation. The work of Posey is exemplary of this argument.9\nPosey was one of the first scholars to draw attention to the concept of bio-\nprospecting, and he identified a connection between the role of anthropologists\nand the commercial exploitation of indigenous peoples\u2019 knowledge. He argued that\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS SYSTEMS 203\nthere was a real danger that traditional knowledge as recorded by anthropologists\ncould be legally expropriated by companies without acknowledging its indigenous\nroots. Posey sought to protect traditional knowledge by defining it as the opposite\nof scientific knowledge: \u201cfor indigenous peoples, knowledge is viewed as emanat-\ning from a spiritual\u2014not a unilinear scientific\u2014base. Thus, all Creation is sacred,\nand the sacred and secular are inseparable.\u201d10\nAlthough Posey recognized the need for indigenous peoples to protect their tra-\nditional knowledge, he argued that it would be difficult to use IPR to achieve this\ngoal. He saw IPR as a new form of exploitation in the long history of colonial\nsubjugation of indigenous peoples\u2014a concept which he called genetic terra nul-\nlius.11 He also wrote that IPR was inadequate and inappropriate for the protection\nof traditional knowledge because it recognizes individual and not collective rights;\nrequires a specific act of intervention; stimulates commercialization; recognizes\nonly market values; is subject to economic powers and manipulation; is difficult\nto monitor; and is expensive, complicated, and time consuming.12 Posey\u2019s view\nthat IP law poses a threat to the cultural integrity and rights of indigenous peo-\nples was taken further by other scholars, who argued that it also undermines their\nterritorial and resource rights. Thus, it has become a widely held view that con-\nventional IPR should not be applied to traditional knowledge.13\nMuch of the current discourse about bioprospecting emphasizes the incompat-\nibility between traditional knowledge and IPR by engaging with a position that\n(a) highlights the uniqueness of traditional knowledge that is culturally bound in\nspace and time; (b) emphasizes the oppositional traits of traditional and scientific\nknowledge in the ways in which they are generated, recorded, and transmitted;\nand (c) classifies the two into separate categories with regard to how culture and\nnature are related.\nHowever, the current understanding of traditional knowledge has been produced\nwithin a specific set of assumptions and objectives.14 In most cases, the term tra-\nditional knowledge is used not only to describe a category of knowledge but also to\ncarry particular political messages, including criticizingWestern approaches to de-\nvelopment, protecting the environment of a particular group, and highlighting an\nexploitative Western stance toward nature. A combination of these political agen-\ndas is used in the bioprospecting or biopiracy literature.15 Although we do not ques-\ntion the substance of these political messages, we do suggest that it is now timely to\nrevisit the discourse which sustains a dualism between modernism and tradition-\nalism. Our position has developed out of the research with the San, which has re-\nvealed that this group of indigenous peoples are not a priori opposed to the\ncommercialization of their traditional knowledge or to its protection through IPR.16\nAnother look at the Western\/traditional dichotomy of knowledge, combined with\nan examination of the literature in the new commodification discourse may open a\nnew chapter in the debate about IPR and traditional knowledge.17\nThe work of Sunder stands out in current debates about the fate of traditional\nknowledge. She argues that \u201creifying the public domain may have the unin-\n204 SASKIA VERMEYLEN, GEORGE MARTIN & ROLAND CLIFT\ntended effect of congealing traditional knowledge as the opposite of property,\npresenting poor peoples\u2019 knowledge as the raw material of innovation\u2014ancient,\nstatic and natural\u2014rather than as intellectual property\u2014modern, dynamic, sci-\nentific, and cultural invention.\u201d18 Following Sunder\u2019s logic, we argue that the\ninitial academic emphasis on the uniqueness of traditional knowledge has be-\ncome counter-productive, adding to a situation wherein it is increasingly prob-\nlematic that indigenous peoples can protect their knowledge (with IPR).19\nAlthough this proposition is a reconfirmation of Sunder, we hope to further the\ndebate by drawing attention to a social construction of science as local knowl-\nedge, and by questioning the extent to which science is uniquely dynamic, inno-\nvative, and evolving.\nInternational institutions like the Convention on Biological diversity and the\nWorld Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) promote definitions that\nstress oppositional knowledge systems. This has repercussions for another de-\nbate: how traditional knowledge should be protected to preserve biological and\ncultural diversity. Although historical and social studies recognize the fluidity and\npermeability of knowledge and the cultural hybridity of innovation, law re-\ninforces cultural boundaries by locating traditional knowledge in a fixed time\nand space.20 Both law and science strive to detach knowledge from its local, or-\nganic social base and fit it into categorical abstractions. Both underestimate how\ntheir common framing template\u2014the Enlightenment\u2014continues to influence\nthem.\nThis dualistic thinking about scientific and traditional knowledge within the\nIPR framework\u2014useful as opposed to useless, obvious as opposed to opaque, and\ninnovative as opposed to static\u2014has its roots in the Enlightenment. Revisiting the\nhistory of ideas is particularly relevant for an IPR audience. The contemporary\nstrand of Enlightenment thinking\u2014the modernist discourse\u2014continues to have\nconsiderable influence, as exemplified by the approach taken in the rediscovery of\ntraditional knowledge in conservationist and environmental discourses.\nMODERNIST AND POSTMODERNIST VIEWS\nOF TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE\nAs illustrated from Sillitoe\u2019s analysis of the literature, conventional wisdom usu-\nally depicts science as more rational, theoretical, and evidence-based in compari-\nson to traditional knowledge.21\nWhether or not there is substantive validity to these descriptive distinctions be-\ntween indigenous and scientific knowledge, the typological method serves to ex-\naggerate them, in much the same way that group stereotypes sharpen a few selected\ncharacteristics of human groups. Although it may be recognized that there is a\ndiversity of knowledge traditions around the world, modern Western science is\nthe epistemological standard.22\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS SYSTEMS 205\nPottier argues it is the positivist view that knowledge is unitary and system-\natized, which explains why modern scientists regard their method as superior to\ntraditional knowledge.23 Other defining characteristics have been attributed to this\npositivist framework\u2014that it emphasizes competition rather than cooperation, fo-\ncuses on the individual rather than on the collective, and stresses regulation rather\nthan responsibilities.24\nDuring the Age of Reason knowledge production was deemed inefficient and\noverly based in subjective imageries. Experience was to be framed in a more me-\nchanical, universal, and objective manner; and the emphasis in knowledge cre-\nation shifted towards the individual. The successes of Bacon, Descartes, and Newton\noffered a new way of producing knowledge, which was later tied to Hume\u2019s em-\npiricism. Perceptions of individual scientists became increasingly important at the\nexpense of community experiences in the process of knowledge production. In\nthe quest for certitude, science\u2014in this logical positivist form\u2014separated itself\nfrom other forms of knowledge production.\nThis way of thinking about science had repercussions in the way society and\npolitics were perceived. Locke and other Enlightenment thinkers universalized Eu-\nropean society and its socioeconomic and political infrastructures by separating\nthemselves from non-Europeans who were encountered in the spread of Western\ncolonialism. Indigenous peoples were considered less advanced, and the Enlight-\nenment assessed how far they were removed from achieving European civiliza-\ntion. The belief in the progress of humanity to a cosmopolitan and rational\nperfection gave Locke and company the authority to demean non-Europeans, who\nwere at risk of being stuck in a lower state of development.25\nEmergent social science was fully stamped with the Enlightenment worldview,\nbecause it developed a technocratic approach steeped in universal laws of behav-\nior; \u201cfrom then on, social science portrayed the study of a particular place as one\nthat produced a deficient version of knowledge.\u201d26 European civilization, through\ncolonialism, universalized its assets, and linked its raison d\u2019\u00eatre to the purported\ninferiority of those outside it. A prime means by which this was accomplished was\nthrough systematically minimizing and distorting traditional knowledge.\nThe modern individual took form as opposed to its antithesis\u2014the savage. \u201cIn\norder to define \u2018us\u2019 there must be a corresponding \u2018them\u2019 against \u2018we\u2019 come to rec-\nSubject Traditional Knowledge Scientific Knowledge\nCommunication Oral Written\nTeaching through doing Didactic\nDominant Mode of Thought Intuitive Analytical\nCharacteristics Holistic Reductionist\nSubjective Objective\nExperiential Positivist\n206 SASKIA VERMEYLEN, GEORGE MARTIN & ROLAND CLIFT\nognise ourselves as different.\u201d27 The Enlightenment embraced Plato\u2019s dualist epis-\ntemology wherein the mind gains true knowledge to the degree that it separates\nfrom the body. This was a basis for a theoretical paradigm in which knowledge of\nthe truth depended on a separation from its opposite.28 The process of creating\na universal modernity could be achieved only when the savage was included\u2014\nbut circumscribed as well. The indigenous were destined to perpetually strive for\nthe status of the modern and were denied any alternative status on the basis of\ntheir intrinsic difference. Thus, modernity\u2019s ordered and deterministic worldview\nemerged in its opposition to the spontaneity and mimetic responsiveness of\ntradition.\nAlthough the colonial conquest was built on the economic, political, and social\ndispossession of non-Western cultures, it also resulted in an epistemic erosion for\nthese cultures. Most modern scientists shared the racist views of the European\ncolonialists. The father of modern Western science, Bacon, conceptualized mod-\nern science as the \u201cproduction of facts that were useful for the effective conquer-\ning of the physical universe, alien cultures, alien peoples, and alternative knowledge\nsystems.\u201d29 Bacon rejected all previous scientific traditions and imposed a new\nform of scientific knowledge that was equated with power and domination. The\nconcept of knowledge as power meant for Bacon that with proper science it was\npossible for the \u201cEuropean white man\u201d to manipulate nature to maximize a ma-\nterial exploitation of the natural world.30\nThus, from the outset the Enlightenment and its modernist project were steeped\nin a dualist discourse: preaching enlightenment, scientific rationality, and human-\nism but at the same time practicing violence and irrationality. How does modern-\nist dualism relate to postmodernist views of traditional knowledge?\nPostmodernism shares some of the methods of modernism but its substance is\ndifferent. \u201cWe Westerners are absolutely different from Others!\u201d is the moderns\u2019\nvictory cry, or protracted lament.31 This great divide continues to obsess. The sav-\nage has become the other and is now used to highlight how it once was for West-\nern societies, a process labelled as \u201ca lament of falsely re-collective nostalgia for\nsome lost sense of spiritualism, family, place [and] unity.\u201d32 This sort of thinking\nis found in the conservationist discourse in which indigenous peoples are por-\ntrayed as existing in harmony with a pristine world. It is assumed, because indig-\nenous peoples now have, and have had in the past, a relatively small ecological\naffect, that they are in harmony with nature. This has been called the \u201cmyth of\necological wisdom\u201d by Milton.33 The reality is that indigenous peoples have al-\nways altered their environments, including extinguishing species\u2014that their small\necological footprints have been in part the product of low populations.\nThere is a danger that such an idealized authenticity, for which postmodernity\nlongs, imposes an unjustifiable burden on indigenous peoples: re-traditionalism.\nAlthough it mirrors outside expectations, it also inhibits the capacity to recreate a\nsustainable society from within. An example of re-traditionalization is the Khwe\nSan revival of hunting. Even though hunting is forbidden by the game park status\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS SYSTEMS 207\nof their West Caprivi (Namibia) homeland, the Khwe emphasize the importance\nof hunting with bow and arrow as a main feature of their heritage. This may be a\ndisservice to their efforts to preserve their society and knowledge in the new world\nin which they now live. There is a risk that the Khwe will become occupants of an\nindigenous theme park, rather than of the post\u2013hunter-gatherer world that sur-\nrounds them. Like the Khwe, many indigenous peoples now live in dramatically\nchanged circumstances.34\nIn summary, both modernist and postmodernist views tend to rely on a cat-\negorical partition of indigenous knowledge. In science, it often is seen only as a\nresource of testable data. In the alternative noble-other vision, it is seen through a\nback to the future lens. The result is that, despite the fact that most indigenous\npeoples live in a present far from their hunter-gatherer days, to establish their case\nfor sustainability they are compelled to choose between two paths, both defined\nby outsiders: modernist in which they are backward or postmodernist in which\nthey are forward.35\nSuch expectations reinforce the indigenous\/scientific knowledge dualism. Prac-\ntical scientists use the dualism to get an argument across that science trumps tra-\nditional knowledge. Simultaneously, idealistic conservationists use a dualism to\npromote a romanticized version of indigenous lifestyles. The emphasis on differ-\nences inhibits a search for potentially useful similarities and synchronicities in the\ntwo knowledge systems.36\nBerkes suggests that the continued referral to two distinct knowledges\u2014one\nabstract and the other concrete\u2014can be traced to the writings of Weber and\nNietzsche.37 This system-of-knowledge analysis emphasizes that traditional\nknowledge is characterized by its embeddedness in local milieu; boundedness in\nspace and time; sense of community; and lack of separation between nature and\nculture, between subject and object. These features contrast with Western scien-\ntific knowledge, which is characterized by disembeddedness; universalism; indi-\nvidualism; and nature-culture, subject-object dualisms. Today,Western cultural and\nnatural preservationists wish to see exotic peoples preserved as idealized, superior\ncultures that live in harmony with nature.\nA FALSE DICHOTOMY?\nThus, many outsiders, both modernist and postmodernist in outlook, differenti-\nate between indigenous and scientific knowledge in such a way that the two are\npictured only in essentialized forms; the former being organic, holistic, intuitive,\nlocal, practical and egalitarian, and the latter being rationalistic, reductionist, theo-\nretical, abstract and objectively verifiable.38 Although it must be acknowledged that\nthere are numerous substantial differences between the two approaches, there re-\nmains the question of whether or not these differences compose a dichotomy that\naccurately describes reality\u2014and is therefore useful. Some argue that even the\n208 SASKIA VERMEYLEN, GEORGE MARTIN & ROLAND CLIFT\nbedrock polarities, between oral and written, fixed and flexible, particular and uni-\nversal, are too simplistic.39\nEmphasizing that traditional knowledge is incompatible with science diverts us\nfrom the task at hand. Ellen argues for an integrated approach that incorporates\nboth to preserve traditional knowledge.40 Another analyst points to what is missed\nin technocratic approaches: \u201cTechnocratic arrogance does not recognize that bio-\ndiversity will not survive without the co-evolving human diversity that is partic-\nular to place, which also includes linguistic diversity, diversity in food and medicinal\nsystems, and even in the ways we see how culture and nature intermingle.\u201d41\nIronically, science owes its existence to traditional knowledge. Western science\u2019s\nbirth is usually traced back to the scientific revolution that began in seventeenth-\ncentury Europe, but it did not emerge de novo. It was built on existing folk knowl-\nedge, from Europe and (later) its colonies. Thus, horticulture grew out to botany,\nalchemy grew out to chemistry, and practical mechanics grew out to physics. The\npractice of codifying folk knowledge continued into the nineteenth century and\nled to work that, although presented as Western science, resulted from earlier prac-\ntices rooted in traditional knowledge.42\nOnly in the early twentieth-century, when folk knowledge was sufficiently ab-\nsorbed into science, was it rejected on the grounds that it was inferior. However,\nthe historical fact that traditional knowledge is part of what is now labelled mod-\nern or Western science makes it awkward to continue to draw boundaries between\nthem. Indigenous peoples today can rightfully claim that their knowledge is, in an\norganic sense, already part of science.43\nScientific and traditional knowledge are not only connected through historical\npractices, they also share a framework of assumptions about how the world is\nconstructed and how people relate to the world. Human beings, in their percep-\ntions and representations of nature, distinguish between empirical facts and the\nsymbolic and mythical values attached to them. Cultures blur the borders be-\ntween the objective and the subjective. However, within science a separation be-\ntween its subjective and technical aspects has been introduced to promote an\nobjective rationality. Nevertheless, science, like any other knowledge system, springs\nfrom and protects the interests of a particular culture. Thus, scientists conform to\nan institutionalized model, which is exemplified through practices such as special-\nist terminology, taxonomic nomenclature, methodological protocols, specialist jour-\nnals, and so forth. Science and scientific knowledge also serve particular economic\nand political interests. This is not to argue that they are contaminated so much as\nit is to argue that they are socially embedded. Scientific knowledge is, like tradi-\ntional knowledge, a social and cultural as well as a technical practice. Indeed, there\nis an extensive literature within science itself, which details its social dimensions\nand underpinnings\u2014that of the social construction of science.44\nAlthough the formats of indigenous and scientific knowledge may differ (e.g.,\nstory telling versus academic publications), the concept of knowledge as a social\npractice is just as relevant for science as it is for traditional knowledge. This means\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS SYSTEMS 209\nthat, in the words of Ravetz, \u201cthe deepest problems in the understanding of sci-\nence are social rather than epistemological.\u201d45 He argues that in fact science em-\nbodies a fundamental paradox between being an enterprise requiring a creative,\npersonal, and subjective craft, on the one hand, and being an objective, imper-\nsonal, and data-manufacturing factory, on the other.\nAcceptance of the idea that all knowledge is socially produced softens the du-\nalism between indigenous and scientific knowledge. Instead of existing within to-\ntalizing binary poles, indigenous and scientific knowledge can be more usefully\nplaced on a continuum, in which at least some differences are not absolute but\nrelative. Such an approach might be rooted in studies of particular social practices\nthat are the basis of the differing knowledge systems.46\nFeminist analyses contribute to the contemporary critique of an idealized sci-\nence, as noted by Feldman and Welsh: \u201c[G]reater attention to the nuances posed\nby feminist perspective can challenge some of the assumptions of a positivist frame-\nwork [of science], particularly the tendency towards dualist thinking.\u201d47 Much of\nthe feminist critique of a pure science is based in its earlier critique of the essen-\ntialist dichotomy of male\u2013female. Indeed, it has become a commonplace realiza-\ntion that the indigenous and the feminine have been portrayed by a hegemonic\nscientific-masculine culture as sharing similar characteristics (e.g., being intuitive\nand subjective).\nScholars engaging feminist theory argue that the oversimplified rhetoric of in-\ndigenous versus scientific knowledge fails to address underlying asymmetries of\npower\u2014that a distorted power relationship can be held responsible for the con-\ntinued marginalization of indigenous peoples and the subordination of their knowl-\nedge systems. Ultimately, the continued existence of indigenous knowledge and\nthe societies they underpin depends on the outcome of the confrontation between\nthe powerful and the powerless. The question has been framed by Davis: \u201cCan\nmassive cultural appropriation of the intangible cultural heritage of indigenous\npeoples be treated as an autonomous issue, or does it follow more or less inevi-\ntably from the power difference between small-scale societies and the world\u2019s in-\ndustrial giants?\u201d48\nWhat is needed is to \u201cfind ways to give a voice to local knowledges without\nsmothering them in totalising theories.\u201d49 The fact is that all knowledge systems\nare shadowed and even fragmented by power relations, involving differences of\nclass and race as well as of gender. This has been analyzed as \u201cknowledge politics\u201d\nby Stehr.50 The essence of knowledge politics lies in strategic efforts to move the\nsocial control of knowledge into the cultural, economic, and political center of\nsociety, where the main concern then becomes the generation of rules and sanc-\ntions to subsume knowledge within property relations.\nTotalizing definitions of traditional knowledge are often linked to the distinc-\ntiveness of its temporal borders and spatial contexts. However, it is not stationary\nor unchanging. Instead, it is syncretic and dynamic, continuously influenced by\noutside ideas.51 Traditional knowledge interfaces with other knowledge systems,\n210 SASKIA VERMEYLEN, GEORGE MARTIN & ROLAND CLIFT\nwhile at the same time it is socially and culturally embedded. Neither indigenous\nnor scientific knowledge exist in a silo; both have been transformed through mu-\ntual exchanges since at least the fifteenth century.\nArguments to the effect that indigenous peoples are still living in the past and\nare unable to incorporate new challenges and situations into their knowledge sys-\ntems can be challenged. For example, most of the indigenous communities that\ndealt with colonialism were able to survive, however marginally, and they had to\nhave flexible as well as tenacious knowledge systems to do so. In this sense, indi-\ngeneity has more to do with its encounter with modernity\u2014through the institu-\ntions of the state, capital, science, and property\u2014than with timeless and locally\nbounded identities. Notions of embodiment, location, and history are an antidote\nto such essentialism.52 Understanding any knowledge production, whether scien-\ntific or indigenous, requires an appreciation of the value of historically framed\nand situated experiences.\nFor scholarly disciplines such as STS, the fundamental basis for thinking about\nscience is that theories, observations, institutions, methods, machines, and net-\nworks are socially shaped in one way or another. We suggest that by accepting\nthis episteme it becomes easier to put traditional knowledge on a par with sci-\nentific knowledge. The approach of examining science as an active process of\nsocial construction, in which a variety of actors build a heterogeneous network\nof relations to make their theories and devices, allows for a questioning of the\nconventional narrative of Western scientific truth.53 The fact that traditional knowl-\nedge is as innovative as scientific knowledge is already acknowledged in the\nliterature.54\nAs we have tried to demonstrate by engaging a critique of the Enlightenment,\nthe narrative of science has always been part of the general culture of society. The\nscientific revolution\u2019s abstract and positivist epistemology was just as much a part\nof the colonialist era as was the conquest of vacant land. In considering science as\nsuch a set of situated practices it becomes easier to decenter it and to develop a\nmore comprehensive framework in which all knowledge systems can be recog-\nnized and protected\u2014for what they are.55\nLOCAL KNOWLEDGE\nRouse proposes that any knowledge, from an epistemological and political per-\nspective, should be defined as a field of practical skills and activities, and ques-\ntions the conventional view of science as consistent and coherent. Instead, he\nargues that science is a local knowledge \u201cembedded in the ability to employ con-\ncrete exemplars in the absence of agreed-upon interpretations of them; science is\nnot dependent upon the particular developments of theoretical explanations [but\ndepends] on the importance of locally, materially, and socially situated skills and\npractices for all understanding and interpretation.\u201d56\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS SYSTEMS 211\nRouse posits that scientific research cannot and should not become disentan-\ngled from \u201cone\u2019s involved, skilful craft knowledge of a field of objects and prac-\ntices or from one\u2019s practical needs.\u201d57 He refers to Heidegger\u2019s idea that the\ninterpretation of opportunities in scientific research requires Vorhabe and Vor-\nsicht, the understanding of which is locally situated in that it refers to a partic-\nular configuration of persons, skills, equipment, and so forth. For Rouse, science\nis an activity that takes place against a backdrop of localized practices supported\nby acquired skills, practices, and equipment (including theoretical models), rather\nthan an exercise in systemized theorizing.\nAs such, knowledge is a space in which linkages and then assemblages are es-\ntablished. A variety of components\u2014people, skills, knowledge\u2014are linked by so-\ncial strategies through which a local space is created where knowledge can flourish.\nThe innovative aspect of knowledge does not lie in the unique substance of tech-\nnoscientific knowledge but rather in the innovative assemblage of different knowl-\nedge producers who may operate in different spaces. Assemblage is a term Turnbull\nborrowed from Deleuze and Guattari, who use it to identify the connection of a\nwide variety of components which at first sight seem to be incompatible.58 We\nextend Turnbull\u2019s argument that knowledge production is essentially a local pro-\ncess by suggesting that such an explicit focus on localness allows for a bridging of\ncross-cultural knowledge systems.59 This localness is a proximity or community\nof praxis and is not geographically limited.\nWhen the cultural uniqueness of traditional knowledge and the innovative qual-\nity of scientific knowledge are emphasized, the two cannot be compared, let alone\nbridged. In STS discourse, science is\u2014just like traditional knowledge\u2014steeped in\nculture and social processes. Thus, the defining characters of both scientific and\ntraditional knowledge can be reduced to a local knowledge space. As Turnbull ar-\ngues, through such a reduction, it is easier to \u201cassemble\u201d different knowledge spaces\nto create a third space: what he calls trust.60 This third space is relevant when the\nprocess of knowledge production begins in traditional knowledge and is devel-\noped in scientific knowledge.\nIt is precisely at this point of creating a third knowledge space that we suggest\nIPR can play a significant role. For local knowledge spaces to move in place and\ntime (i.e., from their local site and time of production to other places and times),\na framework is needed. Such a framework should allow for the free movement of\nknowledge spaces without powerful restrictions\u2014power in the Foucauldian sense.\nFor knowledge to become mobile, its producers must have room in which to de-\nploy a variety of social strategies and technical devices for establishing a network\nof connections. This assemblage, providing for a safe movement of knowledge,\ncould be framed through IPR.We elaborate this point with the example of hoodia.\nAccording to our suggestion, it would be erroneous to mark any knowledge\nrelated to hoodia as either traditional or scientific. Whether it is consumed in its\nnatural setting in the Kalahari or in a laboratory in Pretoria, its appetite-suppressing\nand thirst-quenching properties remain the same. Although the San refer to hoodia\n212 SASKIA VERMEYLEN, GEORGE MARTIN & ROLAND CLIFT\nas their \u201clife force\u201d and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)\ntechnicians call it the \u201cP57 molecule,\u201d both are referring to the same qualities of\nthe same flora. This illustrates that the dualism between traditional and scientific\nknowledge can come down to what Latour calls articulation, a difference in lan-\nguage, or as we have described, two local knowledge spaces.\nThe difference between traditional and scientific knowledge lies in the \u201cnotion\nof the articulated propositions.\u201d61 Although P57 relates to the articulation of ap-\npetite suppression, hoodia relates to the articulation of life force. However, in the\ncurrent IPR model only the articulation of P57 fulfils the criteria of being inno-\nvative and is protected by law. Hoodia as life force is what Sunder calls \u201craw ma-\nterial\u201d and it is not protected.62 We suggest that hoodia as a local knowledge space\nof life force and hoodia as a local knowledge space of P57 can be linked and as-\nsembled. In this respect we argue that the defining character allowing knowledge\nto be patented should not be the innovation of scientific practices (miracle mol-\necules) but the creation of a third space of trust that provides legal recognition\n(through IPR) for the historical creation of innovation across local knowledge\nspaces. Such a third space for knowledge can cover the entire process of produc-\ntion and consumption, from plants in nature to pills in pharmacies.\nCONCLUSION\nSunder has proposed to shift poor people\u2019s knowledge from being a subject of IP\nto an object of IP by emphasizing the innovative aspect of traditional knowledge,\nputting it on a par with scientific knowledge.63 We propose an additional shift: to\ndefine both traditional and scientific knowledge as local knowledge, with both act-\ning as agents of IP. In this sense IPR could become a legal knowledge space that\nrecognizes and encourages the connection of a multitude of local knowledge spaces.\nThis legal knowledge space must be characterized by trust (justice) to facilitate\nthe movement of local knowledge between different places and times.\nThus far it has been argued that traditional knowledge is just as innovative and\nevolving as scientific knowledge, and therefore compatible with current IPR re-\nquirements. We suggest that the idea of the innovation of science is a descendent\nof a dualistic Enlightenment. In positing scientific knowledge as another form of\nlocal knowledge, traditional knowledge can lose its inferior status. The act of as-\nsemblage between different local knowledge spaces is the innovation. Intellectual\nproperty rights could become a mechanism that frames the full life cycle of inno-\nvation, instead of simply validating its last stage (i.e., the technoscientific one). If\nthe last stage results in a marketable commodity, its owners are the assemblage of\nlocal knowledge spaces that produced it, not just the pharmaceutical companies\nthat claim its IPR.\nA focus on local knowledge allows for recognition that it is heterogeneous, that\nit is part of an interconnected world and tied to scientific and technical networks\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS SYSTEMS 213\nthrough which it interacts.64 Through such interaction, it is possible that knowl-\nedge can be simultaneously and dynamically situated in the local and the global,\nthe historic and the contemporary, the cultural and the legal.\nThe contemporary lives of most indigenous peoples are a far cry from an ide-\nalized past. Imposing unrealistic definitions of an authentic indigeneity not only\ndistorts their present reality but constrains their social, economic, and political\ncapabilities. Ultimately, the debate about what is traditional knowledge and how it\ndiffers from scientific knowledge is as much rhetorical as it is substantive; and it\ndiverts attention away from more important issues at stake, including the sustain-\nability of indigenous peoples and their knowledge and the potentially valuable\ncontribution of each to sustaining global biological and cultural diversity.\nBy reducing differences between indigenous and scientific knowledge to a bi-\nnary opposition of superiority-inferiority, possible fundamental areas of compat-\nibility are ignored. Instead of marking any piece of knowledge as exclusively\nindigenous or scientific, it makes more sense to assume that knowledge has dif-\nferent logics and horizons, depending on the interests it serves or the manner in\nwhich it is generated. Polarities can promote hierarchy and rigidity, whereas as-\nsemblages can further equity and flexibility. The present polarity between indig-\nenous and scientific knowledge does little to protect or enhance traditional\nknowledge, which faces a range of threats, including corporate expropriation,\ntheme park caricature, and extinction.\nHow might such an approach impact indigenous peoples? The San are an il-\nlustrative case. Although most are now poor farm workers, their knowledge of\nlocal nature can still be a valuable resource for them. In addition to serving to\nsustain their evolving culture, this knowledge could be leveraged in negotiations\nwith outsiders interested in profiting from it, applying it to sustainability projects,\nor preserving it. In addition, formal recognition of the San claim to a local knowl-\nedge space will help them sustain its related social practices, including collective\nsharing. However, the principal point would be to treat them as potential partners\nin an assemblage of knowledge. This would serve to legitimize them and contrib-\nute to their efforts to move out from under domination by the Europeans and\nAfricans who historically subjugated, and continue to dominate, them. Of course\nsuch a shift would present a significant challenge to national governments, as well\nas to the international IPR regime.\nThe concept of traditional knowledge limits knowledge to traditional land where\nthe San lived in the past. However, they have been resettled to land where there\nare other ecosystems and where they have developed a new knowledge base for\nlocal biota. A major value of the concept of local knowledge space to resettled\nindigenous peoples is that it links knowledge to their new lands. Although tradi-\ntional knowledge ties knowledge to traditional places (or historical homelands),\nlocal knowledge space ties it to local places (or present homelands).\nLocal knowledge space also allows for recognition that different ethnic groups\nliving on the same land can share rights over it. In areas where different ethnic\n214 SASKIA VERMEYLEN, GEORGE MARTIN & ROLAND CLIFT\ngroups have been exchanging local knowledge for generations, it does not seem\njust that only one group is designated as its sole custodian, with exclusive owner-\nship rights. The concept of local knowledge argues for a bundle of land and knowl-\nedge rights, in which the focus is on sharing through the negotiation of access and\nusage rights.\nFocusing on the local will also facilitate the (re)discovery of a living law. The\nsources of law that regulate IPR are found on library shelves as well as in local\npractices and local stories. Incorporating these local practices into a global script\nis the challenge. However, as argued throughout this article, by unpacking the as-\nsumptions made about traditional and scientific knowledge systems, the gap be-\ntween the global and the local, us and them, may be bridgeable. Without such\nbridging, traditional knowledge\u2019s fate remains problematic.\nENDNOTES\n1.
