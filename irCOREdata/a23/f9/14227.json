It forms part of a larger research project in\nprogress.\nWe identify and discuss six models which may be used to understand the development and\nreuse of learning resources. We focus specifically on the level at which the models\noperate, their purpose, structure and content and critically analyse the advantages and\ndisadvantages associated with their application. Aspects which the models do not\naddress, for instance actual staff practices and the cultural context of development, are\nthen discussed.\nWe focus on understanding academic staff practices and behaviour in learning resources\nproduction. Staff time is a major cost element in the production of learning resources.\nDespite recent international work on costing methodologies for HE and their application\nto networked learning resources (for example, Bacsich and Ash, 2000; DETYA, Ernst\nand Young, 2000; Flashlight, 2002; Jones, 2001; NBEET, 1994), there is little\ndocumentation of the use of staff time in the production of learning resources for face-\nto-face campus-based teaching. This paper is not concerned with costing methodologies,\nrather we are interested in the non-economic factors which influence the everyday\npractice of staff in the learning resources production process. We argue that the latter\nwill enable us to understand better the needs of staff for support in the production of\nlearning resources. A phenomenographic approach is needed to understand the everyday\npractices of staff and factors influencing the learning resources production process.\nIntroduction\nIn the next five to ten years there will be a sector-wide need in HE to produce a wider range\nof teaching and learning materials, for example, more resource-based learning (RBL)\nmaterials for self-directed study. The context for this is rapid technological advancement,\n4\nALT-] Volume 10 Number 2\nincreasing numbers and diversity of students and a decline in the unit of resource\n(NCIHE, 1997). In particular, networked learning resources are increasingly presented as a\ncost-efficient means of maintaining teaching quality (NCIHE, 1997). However, the\nrelationship between cost-effectiveness and quality is contested. This future scenario has\nsignificant implications for university staff, whose time represents the largest cost element\nin the production of learning resources (Chiddick, Laurillard, Quigley and Wolf, 1997).\nSome commentators (such as Noble, 1998) present a pessimistic view of the future status of\nuniversity staff given the increasing automation of teaching and intrusion of commercial\ninterests. The increase in student-centred learning and use of technology may also lead to a\nsignificant change in the role of the teacher, from the 'sage on the stage' to 'guide on the\nside' (Jones, 1999; Salmon, 2000).\nAn extensive survey of the literature has identified few studies which specifically investigate\nthe production of learning resources in campus-based higher education institutions\n(HEIs). We suggest that the production of teaching and learning resources has not been\nconsidered a legitimate research topic, since it is an implicit and routine aspect of academic\nstaff duties. Therefore, there have been few in-depth studies which record everyday\naccounts of learning resources production and the factors affecting this.\nFirstly we introduce the background to the research project, of which this paper is one\npart. We then critically review six models of the learning resources production process and\nits organization. Finally, we suggest that a phenomenographic account of the everyday\npractices of learning resources production is needed.\nBackground to the research project\nThe review presented here is part of a research project funded by the Higher Education\nFunding Council for England (HEFCE)'s Teaching Quality Enhancement Fund (TQEF).\nThe project aims to support the implementation of the institution's Learning and Teaching\nStrategy, which aims to promote effective student learning. For a national overview of\nLearning and Teaching Strategies see Gibbs, Habeshaw and Yorke (2000) and HEFCE\n(2001a; 2001b).\nThe research project will develop an understanding of the needs of academic staff for\nsupport in the production of a variety of teaching and learning resources, including\nnetworked learning resources, for use in undergraduate teaching across all subject\ndisciplines within the university (Plewes and Issroff, 2002). The project will make\nrecommendations about possible future structures for learning resources production at the\nuniversity, including changes to the support and training infrastructure.\nLiterature review\nIn this section we critically review six prominent models which document and cost the\nlearning resources production process. We focus specifically on two aspects: firstly, the level\nat which the analysis operates - for example, institution, course, faculty or department,\nmember of staff, or student; secondly, the levels at which the costs of production of course\nmaterials are experienced. We also consider the purpose, structure and content of the\nmodels, critically analyse the advantages and disadvantages of their applications and issues\narising from this. We discuss:\n5\nLouise Plewes and Kim Issroff Understanding the development of teaching and learning resources: a review\n\u2022 Open University (OU) Course Materials Production Models (Rumble, 1976; Bates,\n1994); .\n\u2022 Costs of Networked Learning Course Lifecycle Model (Bacsich, Ash, Boniwell,\nKaplan, Mardell and Caven-Atack, 1999);\n\u2022 The Pedagogic Toolkit Model (Oliver and Conole, 1999);\n\u2022 Cost Structures of Teaching Methods Model (NCIHE \/ Chiddick et al., 1997);\n\u2022 Student Preferences \/ Consumption of Learning Resources Model (Hobbs and\nBoucher, 1997; Boucher, 1998), and\n\u2022 The Course Resource Appraisal Model (Laurillard, 1999).\nTable 1 presents summary information for the models reviewed.\nModel Level of analysis Level at which\ncosts are experienced\nProcess of application and\nvariables analysed\nOpen University (OU) Faculty and\nCourse Materials course\nProduction Models\nInstitution (specifically\ndistance learning)\nCourse team, specialized division\nof labour:\nStaff time.\nCosts of Networked\nLearning Course\nLifecycle Model\nCourse over\nfull lifecycle.\nActivity based-\ncosting can be\napplied at\nmultiple levels.\nPedagogicToolkit Model Multiple levels, Institution\ne.g., session, week,\nterm, course\nCost Structures of Course Institution\nTeaching Methods Model\nStudent Preferences \/ Course Institution\nConsumption of Learning\nResources Model\nInstitution.

However, there is an established\nliterature on the course material production process for distance learning, in particular the\nUK Open University (OU) (Rumble, 1976; 1992; 1997; Bates, 1994; 1995; 2000). Recent\ndevelopments in online distance education and virtual or 'mega-universities' (Daniel, 1996)\nalso build upon this OU model. We therefore use this model as a starting point for our\nreview. However, since the OU is not representative of most HEIs, the conclusions may not\nbe readily transferable to other contexts.\nOU course materials are generally developed by a course team of thirty people, who meet\nregularly. The team includes subject experts, educational technologists, a BBC producer,\ndesigners, editors and a course assistant. Since there can be several drafts, the development\nand approval of course materials is time-consuming (for example, 18-20 months; Rumble,\n1976), and therefore also expensive (\u00a3450-500 for one hour of printed study materials in\n1988; Bates, 1994). Such a course production system can only be justified by producing\nmaterials for large numbers of students (some OU science foundation courses have student\nnumbers of 30,000; Bates, 2000), and\/or by using the same materials for many years.\nTypical course life is 4-8 years (Rumble, 1976). Course materials are maintained by one to\ntwo members of the course team over the course life, at the end of which they are remade\nor replaced with new materials (Rumble, 1997). This type of mass, industrialized\nproduction with a highly specialized division of labour (Lewis, 1971a, 1971b; Rumble,\n1992; Fames, 1993) is specific to the OU and is not common in campus-based HEIs where\nlearning resources production is more of an ad hoc 'cottage industry' (Fames, 1993; Bates,\n1997; Peters, 1998). Oliver, Bradley and Boyle (2001) have recently described the\norganizational and pedagogical difficulties in a collaborative, iterative approach to the\ndistributed authoring of course materials for a virtual university. This builds upon the OU\ncourse materials production process described above, and again includes a highly\nspecialized division of labour (Peters, 1998).\nRumble (1997) has developed a weighting technique which expresses the staff time required\nto develop OU course materials. The unit of analysis is the faculty, but there is some inter-\nfaculty variation which reflects disciplinary differences in the types of learning resources\ndeveloped (e.g. Becher, 1989; Smeby, 1996; Neumann, 2001). Sufficient course materials to\nkeep the average learner studying for 10-12 hours per week are termed 1 unit. The ratio of\ncourse development time to course maintenance time is 10:1. That is, staff could maintain\n7\nLouise Pfewes and Kim Issroff Understanding the development of teaching and learning resources: a review\nten units of existing materials in the time taken to develop one new unit from scratch.\nWhere staff act as consultants and contribute to the development of units by other people\nthis is weighted at 0.5 of a new unit.\nRumble (1976) and Wagner (1977) have also conducted macro-analyses of staff time taken\nto develop course materials at the level of the whole institution. Rumble and Wagner have\nproduced formulae to calculate the total cost of course material production to the\ninstitution. This is a function of the number of courses in development and presentation,\nstudent numbers, average cost of a course in development and presentation, average\ndelivery cost per student, institutional overhead costs (fixed) and average course life\n(Wagner, 1977). The purpose of this analysis was to inform an ongoing debate about the\ncomparative cost of educating one student by the OU rather than a traditional HEI.\nCourse Lifecycle Model\nThe JlSC-funded 'Costs of Networked Learning' Project (Bacsich, Ash and Heginbotham,\n2001; Bacsich et al, 1999) developed a three-stage cyclic course lifecycle model and\nadvocated the use of activity-based costing (ABC) methods to investigate the costs of\nnetworked learning. The purpose of this model is to make bidden costs explicit and to\npromote the use of a standard costing methodology for the HE sector.\nThe three stages of the course model are: planning and development; production and\ndelivery; maintenance and evaluation. The model is based on course planning frameworks\nfrom the distance education sector (see previous section), designed to be equally applicable\nto both traditional and electronic learning resources. The model considers the course in the\nfull context of pre-course (R & D) and post-course (evaluation) activities.\nABC is an accounting method where the cost of a product or service is determined by the\nactivities involved in its production, not by volume-related allocation of overheads such as\nstaff hours. ABC methods may be applied at a number of different levels, such as\ndepartment, faculty or institution (Bacsich et al., 2001);\nApplication of the model involves use of a nested set of spreadsheets to examine costs at a\nvariety of levels and to identify which of three stakeholders (the institution, staff or\nstudents) meets these costs. The student perspective is rarely considered, although the\nHobbs and Boucher (1997) model considers student preferences (see later section).\nHowever, this model does not investigate the non-economic issues surrounding learning\nresources production. Also, specialist training and software are required before the ABC\nmethods promoted may be used. Therefore, this approach may not be accessible to those\nwithout training in ABC methods. The results, however, should be comprehensible to all\nuniversity staff and the standard costing methodology should enable comparisons to be\nmade.\nThe Pedagogic Toolkit Model\nThis project produced an online course design toolkit (Oliver and Conole, 1999), designed to\noperate flexibly at a variety of levels - session, week, term and course. The toolkit enables\nteachers to input teaching activities and educational processes and to plan and cost the\ncourse development process. Although targeted at implementation of learning technology\ninto courses, the toolkit can also be used for traditional teaching methods and resources. The\ntoolkit has three elements. Firstly, 'media rater' looks at the teaching activities to be used.\n8\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 2\nSecondly, 'course modeller' allocates student time between these teaching activities and\nfinally, 'media selector' considers the costs of staff time and resources required to support the\ncourse. Estimates of the time taken to develop various types of materials from scratch are\npresented, although there is no indication of how these data were derived. The toolkit is\nbased on Laurillard's (1993) 'conversational framework' which also informs two other\nmodels discussed here (Chiddick et al, 1997; Laurillard, 1999). The toolkit is easy to use,\nencourages staff to reflect on the mix of media and teaching activities in their courses and to\nconsider alternatives in terms of potential implications for their workload.\nCost Structures of Teaching Methods Model\nNCIHE (1997) noted the recent shift in UK HEIs from a mixture of small-group teaching\nand lectures towards increased use of RBL materials for self-directed study. The\nimplications of this scenario for staff workloads and costs to institutions were examined in\nAppendix 2 of NCIHE (1997) by Chiddick et al. (1997).\nChiddick et al. (1997) analyse how a student's time might be distributed across three\ncombinations of teaching methods each based on different ratios of small group teaching,\nlectures and RBL. Assumptions are made about staff time for preparation and presenta-\ntion required to produce one hour of student learning for each method (Table 2). However\nthere is no indication of the source of these time estimates or how it has been established\nthat these would produce 'one hour of student learning'.\nTeaching method Preparation time (hours) Presentation time (hours) Total time (hours)\nI 1.5\n0 2\n0 20\nTable 2: Assumptions of preparation and presentation staff time required to produce one hour of\nstudent learning for four different teaching methods (Chiddick et al., 1997)\nThe effect of increasing student numbers on staff time spent on learning resources production\nis analysed graphically as cost curves for each of the three scenarios. The report recommends\nthe use of fixed-cost (for example, RBL) rather than variable-cost (for example, small-group)\nteaching methods. Fixed-cost teaching methods are insensitive to increased student numbers\nand the high production costs can be amortized over large numbers of students. Externally\ndeveloped RBL material which can be adapted quickly is a more cost-effective option than\ndeveloping RBL materials in-house, and a shift towards this is promoted (Table 3).\nMethods Traditional study hours\nLectures (max.\n100 students)\nGroups (max.\n10 students)\nRBL (external)\nRBL (in-house)\n3\n0\n2\n20\nLectures\nGroups\nRBL (External)\nRBL (In-house)\n30\n50\n15\n5\nCurrent study hours\n60\n5\n15\n20\nFuture study hours\n10\n30\n50\n10\nTable 3: Alternative combinations of teaching methods (Chiddick et al., 1997,Table I)\n9\nLouise Plewes and Kim Issroff Understanding the development of teaching and learning resources: a review\nChiddick et al. (1997) developed their model in the context of continuing rises in student\nnumbers. However, recent data (HEFCE, 2001c) suggests that large increases in student\nnumbers between 1988 and 1994 (a 67 per cent increase) were followed by a levelling off of\ndemand for full-time undergraduate HE places between 1995 and 2001 (a 6 per cent\nincrease). Also, in practice, the shift away from small-group teaching has not occurred in\nall HEIs. Some have continued to offer small-group teaching while reducing costs by\nemploying lower unit cost staff (such as hourly-paid postgraduate students).\nStudent Preferences \/ Consumption of Learning Resources Model\nHobbs and Boucher (1997) suggest that student attitudes towards teaching methods should\nbe considered, especially given the increasingly 'consumer-led' nature of HE. Therefore,\nthey develop an economic analysis, similar to that of Chiddick et al, using cost curves but\nincorporating 'end user preferences', that is, the consumption of learning resources by\nstudents. They suggest that according to NCIHE (1997) students prefer traditional, non-\ntechnology-based teaching methods such as lectures and small-group teaching, therefore\nthe lowest cost option (RBL) may be unacceptable to students. However, relatively little is\nknown about student preferences and this assumption may be anecdotal. The literature on\nlearning resources in general concentrates on the production of resources by staff, rather\nthan consumption by students, although student feedback on teaching may form part of\nrevised quality assurance procedures. Further research into and explanation of student\npreferences would therefore be useful.\nThe model examines the amount of teaching that can be delivered for a fixed cost output,\nrather than considering input (for example, the staff time to deliver a fixed amount of\nteaching). The analysis focuses on capital rather than labour as the key factor in learning\nresources production. Increasing use of networked learning resources relies upon the\nsubstitution of capital for labour, but it is debatable whether it reduces total costs. Boucher\n(1998) argues that Chiddick et al. do not adequately define what type of costs, total or\naverage, are considered, and neglect other fundamental economic concepts such as\neconomies of scale, marginal costs and diminishing returns. This model makes no\ndistinction between internally and externally developed RBL materials which both\nChiddick et al. (1997) and Laurillard (1999) consider to be fundamental. Hobbs and\nBoucher suggest that the optimal solution of student preferences coincident with lowest\ncost requires improvements in the quality of RBL materials.\nCourse Resource Appraisal Model\nLaurillard's (1999) Course Resource Appraisal Model is a simple framework which tabulates\nthe allocation of student study hours between various learning activities. These relate to\ndifferent media forms, which in turn map on to particular technologies as outlined in Table 4.\nTechnologies\nPrintTV.Video, DVD\nLibrary, DVD, Web\nSeminar; Online group\nLaboratory, Simulation\nEssay, Product Model\nTable 4: Course Resource Appraisal Model, after Laurillard (2001)\n10\nLearning activities\nAttending\nInvestigating\nDiscussing\nPractising\nArticulating\nMedia forms\nNarrative\nInteractive\nCommunicative\nAdaptive\nProductive\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 2\nThe model looks at how student workload is distributed across various learning activities\nand media and assesses the implications for the workload of three groups of OU staff,\ntermed academic, production and presentation. In this model the radical change in the\nrole, workload and relations between technical and academic staff when producing\nelectronic learning resources are significant, as discussed below.\nThe production of electronic learning resources is especially labour-intensive in terms of\ntechnical staff time used in development. This is the main factor in their expense. For\ninstance, at the OU, changing 20 per cent of course material to electronic learning\nresources increases academic staff time by 40 per cent but doubles technical staff time\ncompared with production of traditional learning resources (Laurillard, 2001), assuming\nthat all electronic learning resources are created from scratch. This is a specific example for\nLaurillard (2001); in general the degree of change in workload is dependent on the nature\nof material developed.\nAn alternative option to creating electronic learning resources from scratch is to use\ngeneric, customizable resources. If 60 per cent generic, customizable resources are used,\nacademic staff time increases by only 10 per cent and technical staff time increases by 20\nper cent. Therefore it is not a cost-effective use of staff time for an individual to produce\ntheir own materials, as they do for traditional learning resources (Laurillard, 1999).\nIn traditional campus HEIs, where staff are unlikely to work with dedicated teams of\nproduction staff, the entire burden of resource development and production would\nprobably fall on academic staff. This is confirmed by a national survey of the production of\nelectronic learning resources (HEFCE, 1999), which found that staff were mostly\ndeveloping their own materials for their own needs. In addition, there are complex cultural\nreasons why generic, customizable learning resources are rarely used by academics in\ntraditional, campus-based HEIs.\nWhile the review so far has mainly considered individual models, we now discuss some\ncommon features of the models. All of the models, by definition, are highly abstract and\ndiagrammatic. Several have a strong accounting or economic focus and are concerned with\ncosts. Few of the models explicitly consider staff except as passive variables, and even fewer\nconsider students, with the exception of Bacsich et al. (1999). Most of the models are\nbased on OU course production team methods which, although similar to team production\nof online distance teaching materials, do not correspond well to learning resources\nproduction practices in traditional campus-based teaching. Laurillard's (1993) 'con-\nversational framework' provides the theoretical basis underlying several of the models\n(Chiddick et al.,\\991; Oliver and Conole, 1999; Laurillard, 1999).\nDiscussion: cultural factors influencing development and reuse of\nlearning resources\nThere are two ways in which staff may acquire learning resources without producing them\nthemselves. These are (i) inter-institutional collaboration in the production of resources\nand (ii) the use or adaptation of generic, customizable resources (Laurillard, 1999; JISC,\n2002). Neither of these options is perceived as attractive by academic staff (HEFCE,\n1999), indicating a relatively widespread and entrenched autonomous and decentralized\nmodel of resource production.\nLouise Plewes and Kim Issroff Understanding the development of teaching and learning resources: a review\nBates (2000) has coined the term the 'Lone Ranger and Tonto' approach to describe actual\npractice in the development of learning resources in North American HE. Here the\nacademic ('Lone Ranger') works with or employs an IT-literate graduate student ('Tonto')\nto develop electronic learning resources (Bates, 1997). However, this practice does not\noften produce a usable end product as constant revisions to keep pace with technological\nchange are necessary (Bates, 1997). In contrast to the six models reviewed, this approach\ndescribes actual practice and should, we argue, be developed further.\nIf, as it seems from the examples given above, academic staff are mostly developing\nlearning resources themselves, why is this the case?\nHEFCE (1999) identifies a series of well-known 'constraining and enabling factors' to the\ndevelopment of electronic learning resources. These include lack of IT skills, lack of time\nfor IT training, conflicting priorities, management pressure, incentives and rewards, and\nlack of suitable examples (Tait and Mills, 1999).\nThe opportunity cost of the use of academic staff time is a key issue. HEFCE (1999)\nsuggests that it is not cost-effective to institutions for staff to develop electronic materials.\nHowever, inter-institutional collaborative production can reduce development costs to a\nsingle institution and spread the risk (Laurillard, 1999). Especially at first-year\nundergraduate level, where the core curriculum is common to many institutions, there is\nclear potential for collaboration (Laurillard, 1999). However, at higher levels where courses\nare research-led, difficulties arise which explain the lack of interest in this activity.\nThe use of commercial resources is also possible. Purchasing generic commercial material\nis cheaper than in-house development or commissioning (Hunt and Clarke, 1997;\nLaurillard, 1999), but has tended to be a victim of the 'not-invented-here syndrome' where\nstaff are reluctant to use materials which they feel do not bear their own personal stamp\n(Laurillard, 1999). However, Hammond et al. (1992; 160) suggest that the 'not-invented-\nhere' label is flawed as it\nunderestimates and undervalues the conventional process by which lecturers prepare\nand update their material. They refer to textbooks, monographs, the research literature,\nand their own research and experience for sources of factual information, ideas,\nrepresentations, and organisation during the preparation of lecture notes, seminars and\ntutorials.\nWhile use of commercial materials saves development time, additional time is needed to\nevaluate and adapt resources (Laurillard, 1999). Also, there are few commercial resources\ndeveloped for or targeted specifically at HE, and, conversely, there is little interest by\ncommercial publishers in resources developed by HEIs (HEFCE, 1999).\nThese issues relate to teaching staff reluctance to cede autonomy over teaching content and\ndelivery (Ryan, Scott, Freeman and Patel, 2000). Electronic learning resources in particular\nraise these issues, given their potential to change radically the nature of academic work and\nuniversity organization (see Noble, 1998). For example, the trend towards automation and\ncommodification of HE (Noble, 1998) and publicly available online materials may result in\nincreased scrutiny of these materials, and potentially the substitution of materials for\nteachers (Jones, 1999).\n12\nALT-J Volume \/ 0 Number 2\nConclusions\nThis paper has identified and discussed six models which may be used to understand the\ndevelopment and re-use of learning resources. We have focused specifically on aspects\nwhich these models do not address such as actual staff practices and the cultural context of\ndevelopment.\nThere are few in-depth empirical studies of the everyday practices of academic staff in\nterms of learning resources production. Since these are rarely articulated, recorded or\ndocumented there has been little systematic investigation of the ways in which learning\nresources production is conceptualized. Unless we explore and document these\nconventional forms of work in the production of traditional learning resources, it is\ndifficult to understand the value attached to them and how the increased use of electronic\nlearning resources represents a threat to these traditional resource production practices.\nAs a result of these concerns, there is a need to develop a phenomenographic account of\nstaff everyday practices in the production of a variety of teaching and learning resources.\nPhenomenography is an emerging qualitative research method which is increasingly\napplied in educational research (such as Marton, 1981; Marton, Hounsell and Entwistle,\n1984; Entwistle, 1997; Brew, 2001a; 2001b) to study empirically descriptive conceptions of\nthe world around us. This includes the different ways in which people experience, perceive,\nunderstand and conceptualize the same phenomena.\nReferences\nBacsich, P., Ash, C., Boniwell, K., Kaplan, L., Mardell, J. and Caven-Atack, A.
