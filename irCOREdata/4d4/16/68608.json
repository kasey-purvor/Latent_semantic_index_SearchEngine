Gen. 32, L321-L327 (1999).\nLetter to the Editor 2\nThermally activated escape plays a fundamentally important role in a variety of\nphenomena, ranging from diffusion in solids and on solid surfaces to chemical reactions.\nIt is therefore important to find ways of controlling escape rates. One possible approach\nis through the application of an ac field, which can sometimes give rise to a very\nstrong response. The underlying mechanism is readily understood for low frequency\n(adiabatically slow) driving, where the system remains in quasi-equilibrium under the\ninstantaneous value of the driving force. For a system in thermal equilibrium, the\nprobability of a large fluctuation is given by\nW \u221d exp[\u2212R\/kT ]. (1)\nWe will be specifically interested in activated escape, in which case R is the activation\nenergy of escape. The driving force modulates the value of R quasistatically and, even\nwhere the modulation amplitude A is small compared to R, it may still substantially\nexceed kT , in which case W will be changed exponentially strongly. We emphasize that\nthe change of the activation energy is linear in the field amplitude in this case.\nA different picture might be expected for higher field frequencies, where the driving\nbecomes nonadiabatic. One might suppose that any change in R would depend on the\nintensity I of the driving field rather than just be linear in the field amplitude A \u221d I1\/2,\ni.e. that the field would give rise to an effective \u201cheating\u201d of the system. Such an effect\nhas indeed been discussed and observed for low field intensities [1, 2, 3, 4]. A complete\ntheoretical analysis is significantly more complicated in this case, since one may no\nlonger assume that the system is in thermal equilibrium, so that the activation energy\nR in Eq. (1) may not be set equal to the height of the free-energy barrier. Numerical\nresults in relation to this problem have been obtained for different models: see Ref. [5]\nand references therein.\nFor high-frequency driving, the quantity of primary interest is the period-averaged\nescape rate W\u00af . Recently it was suggested theoreticallly [6, 7] that, for high-frequency\ndriving ln W\u00af should still be linear in the field amplitude A, i.e. that the activation energy\nR in the equation (1) for W\u00af should \u2013 quite counterintuitively \u2013 be linear in A. The\nproportionality coefficient was called the logarithmic susceptibility (LS).\nJust like the conventional linear susceptibility, the LS relates the response of the\nsystem in the presence of external driving to the system dynamics in thermal equilibrium\nin the absence of the driving field. Also, in common with the conventional susceptibility,\nthe LS should display frequency dispersion. This dispersion provides a means for\nselective control of escape rates.\nThe goals of this Letter are to test the very idea of the LS, thereby providing a\nsolid experimental basis for understanding the effect of the ac field on escape rates, and\nto develop a general theory of the frequency dispersion of the LS. The theory exploits\nacausal character of the LS for escape. The measurements are done through analog\nelectronic experiments [8] and digital simulations [9] of the escape rate in a driven\nsystem. Results of such experiments are reported below for a broad range of frequencies\nand amplitudes of the driving field, as well as for a nonsinusoidal field. We provide\nLetter to the Editor 3\ndetailed comparisons of the data with the theory. An additional important goal of the\npaper is to show that, given the system, the LS can be measured directly by experiment.\nThis paves the way for using ac fields for selective control of escape rates (and also of\ndiffusion and nucleation [6, 7]), even where the dynamics of the system are not known\nand have to be determined experimentally.\nWe consider fluctuations of an overdamped Brownian particle driven by a periodic\n(but not necessarily sinusoidal) force F (t) and white Gaussian noise \u03be(t),\nq\u02d9 = K(q, t) + \u03be(t), K(q, t) = \u2212U \u2032(q) + F (t), (2)\nwhere \u3008\u03be(t)\u03be(t\u2032)\u3009 = 2D\u03b4(t\u2212t\u2032). The noise intensity D = kT if relaxation and fluctuations\nare due to coupling to a thermal bath at temperature T .\nThe model (2) is used in many scientific contexts (see e.g. [10, 11, 12] and references\ntherein). We assume that the potential U(q) in (2) has a metastable minimum from\nwhich the system can escape. For convenience, experimental data are obtained for a\npotential with two wells, so that for F (t) = 0 the system is bistable and can switch\nbetween the stable states due to fluctuations.\nThe idea underlying the theory of the LS [6, 7] is that, although the motion of\nthe fluctuating system is random, in a large rare fluctuation from a metastable state\nto a remote state, or in a fluctuation resulting in escape, the system is most likely\nto move along a particular trajectory known as the optimal, or most probable path\n(see [13, 14, 15, 16, 17] and references therein). This path provides a minimum to the\nfunctional\nR[q] =\n1\n4\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ndt [q\u02d9 \u2212K(q, t)]2 (3)\nThe minimum is taken over all instanton-type [18] trajectories which start for t\u2192 \u2212\u221e\nfrom the stable periodic state qa(t) of the dynamical system q\u02d9 = K(q, t), and approach\nas t\u2192\u221e the unstable periodic state of this system qb(t).\nIn the absence of driving (F = 0) the variational problem has a simple solution\nq(0)(t), which is given by the equation\nq\u02d9(0) = U \u2032(q) (4)\nClearly, the most probable escape path (4) is just the time-reversed path from the\nunstable steady state at the top qb of the potential barrier U(q) down to the potential\nminimum at qa [19, 20]. The value of R[q] in this case is equal U(qb)\u2212 U(qa).\nIf the periodic driving force F (t) =\n\u2211\nk Fk exp(ik\u03c9t) is comparatively weak, the\nleading-order correction \u03b4R to the activation energy of escape can be evaluated along\nthe unperturbed most probable escape path q(0)(t)\n\u03b4R = min\ntc\n\u03b4R(tc), \u03b4R(tc) =\n\u2211\nk\nFk\u03c7\u02dc(k\u03c9)e\nik\u03c9tc ,\n\u03c7\u02dc(\u03c9) = \u2212\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ndt q\u02d9(0)(t)ei\u03c9t. (5)\nLetter to the Editor 4\nHere, \u03c7\u02dc(\u03c9) is the LS for escape. It is given [6, 7] by the Fourier transform of the velocity\nalong the most probable escape path q(0)(t) in the absence of driving (F (t) = 0).\nEq. (5) can be understood in terms of the work that the field does on the system\nas it moves along the optimal path. One may expect this work to be related to the\nfield-induced change in the activation energy R for the corresponding large fluctuation.\nThis change is linear in the field, provided that the field-induced change of the optimal\npath itself remains small.\nAn important feature of Eq. (5) is the minimization over tc. It corresponds to\nchoosing the position of the center of the instantonic escape path q(0)(t \u2212 tc) so as to\nmaximize the work the field F (t) does on the system along it.\nUnlike the standard linear susceptibility [21] which, on causality arguments, is\ngiven by a Fourier integral over time from 0 to \u221e, the LS \u03c7\u02dc(\u03c9) is given by an\nintegral from \u2212\u221e to \u221e. The analytic properties of \u03c7\u02dc(\u03c9) therefore differ from those\nof the standard susceptibility, and in particular their high-frequency asymptotics are\nqualitatively different. The standard susceptibility for damped dynamical systems decays\nas a power law for large \u03c9 (e.g., as 1\/[U \u2032\u2032(qa)\u2212 i\u03c9], for the model (2)). In contrast, from\n(5), the LS decreases exponentially fast.\nAsymptotic behavior of \u03c7\u02dc(\u03c9) for large positive \u03c9 can be found by shifting the\ncontour of integration in (5) over t from the real axis to the upper half of the complex\nt plane, as shown in Fig. 1. The function q\u02d9(0)(t) (4) has poles or branching points at\nIm t 6= 0, which correspond to the singularities of U \u2032(q) in the complex q-plane, i.e. for\nIm q 6= 0. For large \u03c9, the major contribution to \u03c7\u02dc(\u03c9) is determined by the parts of the\nintegration contour in Fig. 1 near the singularity of q\u02d9(0)(t) with the smallest value of Im\nt = \u03c4p. Near the singular point one can change from integrating over t to integrating\nover q, which gives for exp(\u03c9\u03c4p)\u226b 1\n\u03c7\u02dc(\u03c9) =Me\u2212|\u03c9|\u03c4p , \u03c4p = min\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Im\n\u222b\ndq\/U \u2032(q)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 . (6)\nHere, the integral is taken from any point in the interval (qa, qb) to the (complex) position\nqp of the appropriate singularity of U\n\u2032(q) corresponding to the singularity of q\u02d9(0)(t\u2212 tc)\nat Im t = \u03c4p. The prefactor M depends on the form of U(q) near qp. In particular, for\na polynomial potential (|qp| \u2192 \u221e) with U(q) = Cq\nn\/n for |q| \u2192 \u221e, we have\n|M | = 2pi|\u03c9\/C|\u03bd|\u03bd|\u03bd+1\/\u03bd!, \u03bd = 1\/(n\u2212 2). (7)\nThis expression applies also for finite |qp|, with U(q) \u2248 C\/\u00b5(q \u2212 qp)\n\u00b5 for q \u2192 qp, if n in\n(7) is replaced by \u2212\u00b5: note that |M | then decreases with increasing \u03c9.\nThe notion of the LS applies not only to escape, but also to the probability of a\nlarge fluctuation to any given state, in which case the integral over time in (5) is taken\nto the moment of arrival in this state, and there is no minimization over tc [7]. The\nanalytic properties of this LS are similar to those of the standard linear susceptibility.\nWe have investigated the escape rate for a driven Duffing oscillator with the\npotential U(q) = \u2212q2\/2 + q4\/4. If the state occupied initially is qa = \u22121, we obtain\nLetter to the Editor 5\nfrom (5)\nq\u02d9(0)(t) = exp(2t)[1 + exp(2t)]\u22123\/2. (8)\nand therefore the LS\n\u03c7\u02dc(\u03c9) = \u2212pi\u22121\/2\u0393(\n1\u2212 i\u03c9\n2\n)\u0393(\n2 + i\u03c9\n2\n). (9)\nIt follows from (9) that \u03c7\u02dc(0) = \u22121, and the LS decays monotonically with increasing\n\u03c9, with \u03c4p = pi\/2,M = \u2212(1 + i)(pi\u03c9)\n1\/2 in (6). Already for \u03c9 > 0.7 the asymptotic\nbehavior of |\u03c7\u02dc(\u03c9)| given by (6) becomes very close to the exact result Eq. (9) which is\nshown with solid line in the inset of Fig. 2.\nThe period-averaged rate of escape from the stable state qa can be found\nconveniently in experiment from measurements of the mean time \u3008t\u3009 to reach a point\nqe well behind the barrier top (so that the probability of returning to the vicinity of qa\nis negligibly small). Our main quantity of interest is the field-dependent correction to\nW\u00af = 1\/\u3008t\u3009. It is given by exp(\u2212\u03b4R\/D) for |\u03b4R| \u226b D [6, 7, 22]. For a sinusoidal driving\nforce, the correction to the activation energy of escape (5) is \u03b4R = \u22122|F1\u03c7\u02dc(\u03c9)|.\nTo test these predictions, we have built an analog electronic model [8] of (2) for the\ndouble-well Duffing potential. We drive it with zero-mean quasi-white Gaussian noise\nfrom a shift-register noise generator, digitize the response q(t), and analyse it with a\ndigital data processor. We have also carried out a complementary digital simulation,\nusing a high-speed pseudo-random generator [9].\nThe analogue and digital measurements of R involved noise intensities 0.028 < D <\n0.036 and 0.020 < D < 0.028 respectively; the lowest (real time [8]) driving frequency\nused was 460 Hz. The results are plotted in Fig. 2. The major observation is that, as\npredicted, R is indeed linear in the force amplitude (R = 1\/4 for F = 0). The slope yields\nthe absolute value of the LS. Its frequency dependence, a fundamental characteristic of\nthe original equilibrium system, is compared with the theoretical predictions in the inset\nof Fig. 2.\nThe results demonstrate that the variation of the activation energy with field can be\nwell described analytically, for a wide range of parameter values, in terms of the LS. We\nnote however a small deviation from the theory at small amplitudes of the external drive,\nand the consequent systematic shift of the experimental and numerical points above the\ntheory (solid line). This deviation arises as a result of the finite noise intensities used\nin the experiment, and the fact that the D \u2192 0 limit of the theory breaks down for\namplitudes F of the external driving for which |\u03c7F |\/D is small; it can be accounted for\nby an extension [22] of the theory taking account of changes in the prefactor.\nWe now discuss some of the new effects that are to be expected [6] when the driving\nfield is non-sinusoidal. They are related to the minimization over tc in (5), which is what\nmakes the logarithm of the escape rate a nonanalytic function of F (t) in the D \u2192 0\nlimit. We can apply the theory (5) to describe the dependence of the activation energy\non field parameters. In particular, we seek experimentally the switching between escape\npaths that is predicted [6] for a simple form of nonsinusoidal driving: the biharmonic\nLetter to the Editor 6\nfield. We took F (t) = 0.1 cos(1.2t) + 0.3 cos(2.4t + \u03c60) and investigated the effect of\naltering the phase difference \u03c60 between the two sinusoidal components. For a field\nof this kind, \u03b4R(tc) (5) may have two local minima; but the activation energy will of\ncourse correspond to its absolute minimum. Thus, as \u03c60 is changed, the escape path will\nswitch from being determined by one local minimum to being determined by the other,\nanalogous to a first order phase transition in which \u03b4R and tc play the roles of the free\nenergy and the order parameter, respectively.\nThis phenomenon can be demonstrated experimentally by direct observation of the\ntwo different escape paths\u2217 providing the two local minima of \u03b4R(tc). Within a critical\nrange of \u03c60, the two escape paths should coexist and be observable experimentally: by\nvariation of the phase difference near its critical value within this range, one should\nobserve switching between the two different escape paths. The effect is clearly evident\nin the analogue data of Fig. 3(a) and (b): a small change in \u03c60 is sufficient to switch\nthe predominant escape path from \u03c6 \u2243 1 in (a) to \u03c6 \u2243 5 in (b).\nIt follows from the above analysis that the absolute value of the logarithmic\nsusceptibility can be recovered from measurements of the correction \u03b4R to the escape\nactivation energy at different frequencies of a sinusoidal driving field. The phase of\nthe LS arg \u03c7\u02dc(\u03c9) can be found by measuring \u03b4R for a driving field with more than one\nharmonic. In particular, for biharmonic driving with period 2pi\/\u03c9, we see from Eq. (5)\nthat \u03b4R depends on the phase of LS in terms of the factor \u0398(\u03c9) = 2 arg \u03c7\u02dc(\u03c9)\u2212arg \u03c7\u02dc(2\u03c9).\nThe solution of this functional equation for arg \u03c7\u02dc(\u03c9), with the boundary condition\narg\u03c7(0) = 0, has the form\narg \u03c7\u02dc(\u03c9) = \u03c9tc +\n\u221e\u2211\nk=0\n2\u2212k\u22121\u0398(2k\u03c9). (10)\nThis expression relates arg \u03c7\u02dc(\u03c9) to the values of \u0398 at the subharmonics 2\u2212k\u03c9 of the\nfrequency \u03c9 (due to analyticity of \u03c7(\u03c9) at \u03c9 \u2192 0, the function \u0398(\u03c9) is quadratic in \u03c9\nfor \u03c9 \u2192 0, and therefore the series (10) converges).\nIn conclusion, we have shown experimentally that thermally activated escape under\nnonequilibrium conditions can be understood in terms of the logarithmic susceptibility,\nand that the latter is a physically observable quantity: the field-induced change of\nthe activation energy for escape is linear in the field amplitude [6, 7] even where\nthe frequency of the field exceeds the reciprocal relaxation time of the system\nand substantially exceeds the escape rate. The LS relates the probability of large\nfluctuations in the presence of an external field to the relaxational dynamics in thermal\nequilibrium. We have shown that the LS for escape displays frequency dispersion which\nis qualitatively different from that of the conventional linear susceptibility. We have\nalso verified experimentally the predicted [6] switching between different branches of\nthe activation energy as a function of the field parameters for biharmonic driving:\nadjustment of its phase (alone) is sufficient to select the escape path.\n\u2217 Coexistence of different escape paths in nonequilibrium systems has been widely discussed.
