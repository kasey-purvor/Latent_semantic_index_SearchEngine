The fen \nspecies were: Molinia caerulea, Juncus subnodulosus, Potentilla erecta and \nHydrocotyle vulgaris and the bog species were: Carex echinata, Potentilla erecta and \nFestuca rubra.  Senescence significantly increased under elevated ozone in all seven \nspecies but only Molinia caerulea showed a reduction in biomass under elevated \nozone.  Decomposition rates of plants exposed to elevated ozone, as measured by \ncarbon dioxide efflux from dried plant material inoculated with peat slurry, increased \nfor Potentilla erecta with higher hydrolytic enzyme activities.  In contrast, a decrease \nin enzyme activities and a non-significant decrease in carbon dioxide efflux occurred \nin the grasses, sedge and rush species. \n \n \nKey words 26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \nTropospheric ozone, wetlands, senescence, chlorophyll content, enzyme activity, \n \nCapsule: \nShort-term, episodic ozone exposure increased senescence and changed short-term \ndecomposition processes in wetland plant species. \n \n \nIntroduction \nTropospheric ozone concentrations have been increasing for the past century from \npre-industrial levels of approximately 10ppb to current background concentrations of \n35-50ppb (Laurila et al., 2004) and are predicted to continue to rise by between 0.5 \nand 2% per year in the northern hemisphere (Vingarzan, 2004).  The effects of \nambient ozone on plants were first observed in the 1950s as an increase in the \nincidence of plant injury in areas affected by photochemical smog (Laurence and \nAndersen, 2003) and it is now known that the principle phytotoxic component of such \nsmog is ozone.  Tropospheric ozone is a major secondary air pollutant formed during \na series of reactions between oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds in the \npresence of sunlight (NEGTAP, 2001).  Elevated concentrations are mainly associated \nwith periods of hot, sunny weather, which are predicted to increase as global warming \ncontinues (Ashmore, 2005).  Although regulations to control the emissions of ozone \nprecursor chemicals are in place in most European countries, the background \nconcentration of tropospheric ozone is continuing to increase, in part due to \ntransboundary transport of precursor compounds through the troposphere (Fiscus et \nal., 2005).  The current tropospheric ozone concentration of 35-50ppb found in \nNorthern Europe is considered to be high enough to be a significant threat to semi-\nnatural vegetation and hence biodiversity (Ramo et al., 2006a).  Ozone toxicity in \nplants causes visible injury to leaves, often coupled with reductions in photosynthesis \nand biomass accumulation (Ramo et al., 2006a).  Current background levels of ozone \nin Europe have already been found to cause visible injury in over 80 species of crops \nand natural vegetation with yield\/biomass reductions reported in some areas (Fuhrer et \nal., 1997; Hayes et al., 2007).  As an ecosystem, peat-forming wetlands are of \nparticular concern because of their ability to store large quantities of carbon with \nvegetated upland peat showing carbon sequestration values between 67 and 183 gCm-\n2yr-1 depending upon the dominant vegetation type present (Bortoluzzi et al., 2006).  \nThe majority of these peat-forming wetlands in northern Europe are in upland areas \nwhere ozone concentrations are comparatively high compared to adjacent low-lying \nareas (Royal Society, 2008), and thus any changes that affect plant growth and \nphysiology have the potential to affect carbon storage within peatlands. \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n66 \n67 \n68 \n69 \n70 \n71 \n72 \n73 \n74 \n75 \n \nRecent research has focused on a variety of semi-natural ecosystems but there is \nrelatively little published information on the effects of ozone exposure on wetland \nplants.  These species are likely to be relatively sensitive to ozone exposure as ozone \nsensitivity is associated with high levels of stomatal conductance, relatively high \ngrowth rates and specific leaf area; all characteristics shared by many wetland species \n(Power and Ashmore, 2002).  Stomatal uptake of ozone is likely to be relatively high \nin wetland plants as they are not normally water-limited and as such may not close \ntheir stomata during the day (Busch, 2000; Koch and Rawlik, 1993; Li et al., 2004; \nMann and Wetzel, 1999; Smith and Houpis, 2004) thereby taking up more ozone \n(Power and Ashmore, 2002).  Studies on wetland plants have shown that elevated \nozone can cause specific visible ozone injury (Power and Ashmore, 2002), an increase \nin senescence and premature senescence (Franzaring et al., 2000) and decreases in \nabove ground biomass (Power and Ashmore, 2002), below ground biomass and \nroot:shoot ratio (Franzaring et al., 2000). \n76 \n77 \n78 \n79 \n80 \n81 \n82 \n83 \n84 \n85 \n86 \n87 \n88 \n89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \n100 \n \nResearch has shown that the carbon flux to soil is affected when plants are exposed to \nelevated ozone; both by altered rhizodeposition and changes in leaf litter quality and \nquantity (Andersen, 2003).  Plants exposed to elevated ozone have been shown to \ncontain a greater proportion of foliar nitrogen (Andersen et al., 2001; Berg and Staaf, \n1980) and are likely to decompose more rapidly, potentially releasing more carbon \ncompounds to the microbial community.  This increased level of foliar nitrogen has \nbeen found to be particularly present when exposure to elevated ozone has caused \nleaves to senesce prematurely.  However, plants exposed to elevated ozone have also \nbeen shown to contain higher concentrations of protective compounds such as \nphenolics (Liu et al., 2005; Paakkonen et al., 1998; Saleem et al., 2001) which would \nreduce the rate of decomposition of leaf litter (Kim et al., 1998) as phenolic \ncompounds inhibit the activity of hydrolase enzymes (Freeman et al., 2001).  Ozone \nexposure has also been found to reduce the below ground biomass of some species \n(Grantz and Farrar, 2000; Grantz and Yang, 2000) which could lead to a reduction in \nthe amount of labile carbon available to the bacterial community.  This is further \nsupported by results from Larson et al. (2002) who found that activity of extracellular \nhydrolase enzymes was reduced in soils that had been exposed to elevated ozone.  \nHowever, McCrady and Andersen (2000) found that ozone exposure increased root \nexudation in spring wheat seedlings, which would lead to an increase in substrates \navailable to soil microbes. \n 101 \n102 \n103 \n104 \n105 \n106 \n107 \n108 \n109 \n110 \n111 \n112 \n113 \n114 \n115 \n116 \n117 \n118 \n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \n124 \n125 \nBelow ground microbial biomass has been found to be significantly reduced by \nelevated ozone in crop systems (Islam et al., 2000) and microbial respiration is also \nreduced by elevated ozone (Phillips et al., 2002).  This is unlikely to be a direct effect \nof ozone, even though it is toxic to bacteria, because ozone reacts with vegetation and \nthe soil surface meaning very little will diffuse into the soil and reach the bacterial \ncommunity (Turner et al., 1974).  Furthermore, recent isotopic studies using 18O have \nfound that, following an 11 hour exposure to 100ppb ozone, there was no ozone \nderived 18O in root tissue of white clover (Trifolium repens) (Toet et al., 2009).  \nHowever, the diversity of bacterial communities found when plants had been exposed \nto elevated ozone was not significantly reduced (Dohrmann and Tebbe, 2005) and, in \npeatlands, exposure to elevated ozone was found to increase total microbial biomass \nby 24% (Morsky et al., 2008). \n \nThis study sets out to investigate the effects of short term (four weeks) ozone \nexposure on seven wetland vascular plant species commonly found in fen and bog \nsystems in Central and Northern Europe.  Percentage senescence and chlorophyll \ncontent were assessed throughout the experimental period, above and below ground \nbiomass were measured at the end of exposure and the short-term decomposability of \nthe above ground plant material exposed to elevated ozone was determined post-\nozone exposure.  The tested hypotheses are that: exposure to elevated ozone will \nincrease senescence and decrease chlorophyll content; exposure to elevated ozone will \ncause a decrease in both above and below ground biomass with a relatively larger \ndecrease being seen in the below ground biomass and exposure to ozone will reduce \nthe rates of decomposition of leaves within wetland soil. \n 126 \n127 \n128 \n129 \n130 \n131 \n132 \n133 \n134 \n135 \nMethods \n \nPlant selection and propagation  \nPlants were collected from two wetland sites in North Wales, UK: Cors Erddreiniog, a \nlow-lying fen site on Anglesey (SH 465 822) just above sea level and Marchlyn \nMawr, an upland bog site in Snowdonia (SH 611 624) at 550m altitude.  Cors \nErddreiniog is an alkaline fen and is part of the Anglesey Fens special area of \nconservation (SAC).  The national vegetation classification (NVC) communities \nfound at this site are M22 (Juncus subnodulosus \u2013 Cirsium dissectum fen meadow) \nand M25 (Molinia caerulea - Potentilla erecta mire) (www.jncc.gov.uk).  Marchlyn \nMawr is on the border of the Snowdonia National Park and contains typical upland \nbog vascular plant species although Sphagnum mosses dominate the area.  The site \nhas not had its NVC classification published, the flora dominant at the site place it as \nbeing M6 (Carex echinata - Sphagnum recurvum\/auriculatum mire) (www.eryri-\nnpa.gov.uk).  Four species from Cors Erddreiniog and three from Marchlyn Mawr that \nwere representative of the dominant vegetation at each site were used in this \nexperiment.  The fen species were Molinia caerulea, Juncus subnodulosus, \nHydrocotyle vulgaris and Potentilla erecta.  The species from the bog site were Carex \nechinata, Festuca rubra and Potentilla erecta. \n136 \n137 \n138 \n139 \n140 \n141 \n142 \n143 \n144 \n145 \n146 \n147 \n148 \n149 \n150 \n \nIndividual plants of each species were collected from the field and potted up using \npeat compost (HUMAX 100% peat) in a greenhouse with controlled lighting and \nheating (day 18oC, night 16oC) until they were large enough for propagation.  One \nmonth before plants were placed in the solardomes, 24 individual plants of each \nspecies were planted into one-litre pots (10x10x10cm).  The plants were matured for \nthree weeks in the greenhouse and were moved to a sheltered outdoor location a week \nprior to being placed in the solardomes.  Plants of each species were then allocated \ninto three size classes with eight individuals in each size class.  Within each group of \neight individuals, one plant was randomly allocated to each solardome so there was \none \u201csmall\u201d, one \u201cmedium\u201d and one \u201clarge\u201d plant per replicate solardome. \n151 \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n156 \n157 \n158 \n159 \n160 \n161 \n162 \n163 \n164 \n165 \n166 \n167 \n168 \n169 \n170 \n171 \n172 \n173 \n174 \n175 \n \nExperimental Design \nPlants were exposed to elevated ozone at the CEH solardome facility at \nAbergwyngregyn from 22nd August 2006 to 19th September 2006.  This facility \nconsists of eight hemispherical, glass domes 2.2 metres high and 3 metres in diameter, \nsituated on an East-West line to minimise differences in shading (Rafarel et al., 1995) \nand receiving two complete air changes per minute.  The experiment was designed to \nsee how plants reacted to a relatively short term, high dose ozone exposure, with peak \nvalues matching those found in some parts of the UK during the summer of 2006 \n(www.welshairquality.co.uk).  Four solardomes were set to receive a constant ozone \nconcentration of 20ppb throughout the experiment (control) and the other four were \nset to an episodic regime with ozone concentrations increasing from 20ppb to 150ppb \nover one day, remaining at 150ppb for three days and returning to 20ppb on the fifth \nday and remaining at 20ppb for two days (elevated ozone).  This profile was repeated \nover the four weeks of the experiment.  The solardomes were arranged as a split block \ndesign with two blocks of four domes.  Within each block, two domes with high \nozone concentrations and two with low ozone concentrations were randomly assigned.  \nOzone was generated by passing oxygen (from a Workhorse 8 oxygen generator, \nOzone Industries Ltd.) through a G11 ozone generator (Ozone Industries Ltd.) where \nelectricity was used to dissociate oxygen molecules that recombined to form ozone.  \nA computer-controlled (Lab-VIEW version 7) mass-flow controller system delivered \nthe correct amount of ozone to the solardomes.  The ozone concentration within the \ndomes was measured on a 30 minute cycle by two API400 ozone analysers \n(Envirotech) with matched calibrations.  Ozone concentrations in one dome were \ncontinually sampled to provide a feedback system using a Model 49C ozone analyser \n(Thermo Electron) and the ozone supply to all domes was adjusted accordingly. \n176 \n177 \n178 \n179 \n180 \n181 \n182 \n183 \n184 \n185 \n186 \n187 \n188 \n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \n193 \n194 \n195 \n196 \n197 \n198 \n199 \n \nPlant measurements \nWhole plant necrotic senescence was measured when the plants were first placed in \nthe solardomes and weekly throughout the experiment.  Senescence was recorded as \nthe percentage of senesced leaves on a plant. A leaf was counted as senesced if more \nthan 25% of the leaf showed necrotic senescence.  Senescence was chosen as a \nmeasure of ozone stress as it is a general response to photo-oxidant stress and the \nsymptoms are not species-specific.  Relative senescence was calculated as the \ndifference between the mean senescence under elevated ozone and the mean \nsenescence from the control. \n \nAn estimate of leaf chlorophyll content of non-senesced leaves was taken weekly \nusing a Minolta SPAD meter.  Measurements were taken on the second youngest, \nfully expanded leaf and only leaves with no visible senescence or ozone damage were \nused.  Festuca rubra and Juncus subnodulosus were not included in this analysis as \ntheir leaves were too narrow and did not fill the sample window. \n \nAbove-ground material was removed from the pot and weighed immediately after \nharvest to determine fresh weight before being dried to constant weight at 65oC.  Root \nweight was determined by washing the root mass through a sieve, removing attached \nsoil and substrate particles and drying to constant weight at 65oC.  From this data, the \nabove ground to below ground biomass ratio was calculated.  After measurements of \nthe dry biomass were made, above ground plant material was mixed to provide \ncomposite dome samples for each species and ground using a ball mill. \n200 \n201 \n202 \n203 \n204 \n205 \n206 \n207 \n208 \n209 \n210 \n211 \n212 \n213 \n214 \n215 \n216 \n217 \n218 \n219 \n220 \n221 \n222 \n223 \n224 \n \nDecomposition assay and sampling \nA microbial inoculum slurry was prepared using 2kg of fresh fen peat from Cors \nErddreiniog (SH 465 822) and 6 litres of deionised water and filtered to remove large \nparticulate matter.  Approximately 1g of dried, ground plant material of each species \n(except H. vulgaris) was accurately weighed and put in individual 125ml glass bottles \nwith 80ml of the pre-prepared slurry.  Blank samples consisted of 80ml of slurry \nwithout the addition of any plant material.  Immediately after sample inoculation, \nbottles were sealed and gases were allowed to accumulate for 1 hour.  During the \naccumulation of gases, bottles were kept in the dark and constantly shaken at 50rpm \nto encourage mixing.  Background samples of laboratory air were taken at the start of \nthe gas accumulation and samples of the gases within the bottles were taken after 1 \nhour. Gas samples were taken using the same method after 3, 5, 7 and 10 days of \nincubation.  Carbon dioxide was measured using a Perkin Elmer Gas Chromatograph \n(GC) fitted with a flame ionisation detector (FID) to detect methane and a methaniser \nto convert carbon dioxide to methane.  The GC was calibrated using bottled gas with a \nknown concentration of carbon dioxide (BOC gases) and this gas was used for quality \ncontrol (QC) at set points throughout each sample run. \n 225 \n226 \n227 \n228 \n229 \n230 \n231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \n237 \n238 \n239 \n240 \n241 \n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n248 \n249 \nTwenty ml water samples were taken and filtered through a 0.45\u03bcm filter after the 10-\nday incubation period.  These were analysed for total dissolved carbon (TC), \nphenolics and dissolved nitrogen.  TC was measured using a ThermaloxTM elemental \nanalyser.  Samples were injected over a platinum-coated, mesh catalyst.  Oxygen was \nused as the carrier gas and thermal catalytic oxidation was used to oxidise carbon \ncompounds in the sample to carbon dioxide.  Carbon dioxide was detected and \nmeasured using a non-dispersive infrared detector.  Standards consisted of Potassium \nHydrogen Phthalate dissolved in distilled, de-ionised water and known concentrations \nwere used to create the calibration curve and for QC standards.  The concentration of \ntotal soluble phenolics was measured using Folin-Ciocalteau reagent following the \nmethods of Box (1983).  This measures polyphenolic compounds including phenolics, \ntannins and lignin.  Dissolved organic nitrogen was measured using the ThermaloxTM \nmachine used for TC measurements and ammonium ions were measured using a \nSKALAR.  After 10 days of decomposition, unfiltered water samples were taken and \nanalysed for phenol oxidase, beta glucosidase and N-acetylglucosaminidase activities.  \nPhenol oxidase assays followed the procedure of Pind et al. (1994) except the liquid \nfrom the assay was used rather than creating a slurry from peat samples.  Beta \nglucosidase and N-acetylglucosaminidase were assayed fluorimetrically following the \nmethod of Freeman et al. (1995). \n \nStatistical Analysis \nValues from the three plants per species per dome were averaged to provide four \nreplicates per ozone treatment at each time point prior to analysis.  The effects of \nozone were assessed using general analysis of variance (GENSTAT version 7).  Data \nmeasured as a percentage was arc-sine transformed in Minitab ver14 prior to analysis \nand back-transformed for presentation.  Ozone dose-response for each species was \nanalysed in Sigma-Plot by linear regression of relative senescence (as difference from \nthe control) against AOT024hr using treatment means from each week of ozone \nexposure.  The significance of the regression and the percentage variation in \nsenescence explained by ozone were analysed using GENSTAT version 8.  Carbon \ndioxide emissions were calculated to give cumulative results over the 10 days of \ndecomposition.  General analysis of variance was used to calculate the significance of \nany differences at each time point and repeated measures ANOVA was used to \nanalyse the change in gas exchange over time.  Analysis of variance was used to \ncalculate any differences in enzyme activity and water chemistry after the 10 days of \nincubation. \n250 \n251 \n252 \n253 \n254 \n255 \n256 \n257 \n258 \n259 \n260 \n261 \n262 \n263 \n264 \n265 \n266 \n267 \n268 \n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \n273 \n \nResults \n \nOzone Exposure in the Solardomes \nAverage ozone concentrations measured in the solardomes over the four week \nexperiment are shown in Table 1. Mean peak ozone concentrations were within 10% \nof the target value of 150ppb and background concentrations were 20ppb for the \nelevated ozone treatment and 13-14ppb for the control treatment.  AOT024hr values \nafter 28 days showed a mean value of 12 ppmh in the control treatment and a mean of \n76ppmh in the elevated ozone treatment while AOT40 (daylight hours) ranged from \n0ppmh in the control treatment to a mean of 27ppmh in the elevated ozone treatment \n(Table 1).  Temperatures in the solardomes followed ambient temperatures but were \ngenerally 1-2oC higher, with a mean daytime temperature of 20oC  and a range of 15-\n28oC and a mean overnight temperature of 14.9oC and a range of 10-20oC. \n274 \n275 \n276 \n277 \n278 \n279 \n280 \n281 \n282 \n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \n287 \n288 \n289 \n290 \n291 \n292 \n293 \n294 \n295 \n296 \n297 \n298 \n \nSenescence \nAll of the species included in this experiment showed an increase in senescence \nduring the four weeks of ozone exposure compared to those under control conditions \n(Figures 1 and 2).  M. caerulea showed a significant increase in senescence under \nelevated ozone in weeks two, three, and four with time also being a significant factor, \nsuggesting the difference in mean senescence values became more pronounced over \ntime (P<0.001).  J. subnodulosus showed the same pattern with a significant increase \nin senescence under elevated ozone from week two of the experiment (P<0.05) and \ntime through the experiment also being a highly significant factor (P<0.001).  P. \nerecta plants from the fen exposed to high ozone showed a significant increase in \nsenescence over the four week experimental period (P<0.05) although the difference \nin senescence measured weekly was only significant in week two.  In weeks three and \nfour the data showed a trend towards significance (P<0.1) but variation within \ntreatments was too high for a statistically significant difference to be measured.  H. \nvulgaris showed a trend towards a significant increase in senescence under elevated \nozone by the fourth week of the experiment (P<0.1) but it did not senesce in the first \ntwo weeks suggesting that it was slower to respond to ozone than other species.   \n \nSenescence on Potentilla erecta plants from the bog showed a trend towards a \nsignificant increase with elevated ozone over the four week experimental period \n(P<0.1) and a highly significant effect of time, meaning that senescence increased in \nplants from both the treatment and the control.  However, percentage senescence \nvalues only differed significantly in week two (P<0.05) suggesting a transient increase \nin senescence.  C. echinata plants showed a significant increase in senescence under \nelevated ozone by week four of the experiment (P<0.05) and time was again a highly \nsignificant factor in the senescence measurements (P<0.001).  F. rubra showed the \nsame pattern as M. caerulea and J. subnodulosus with plants exposed to elevated \nozone showing significantly more senescence by week two (P<0.05) and the \ndifference becoming progressively more significant over time (P<0.001 for \nozone*time interaction). \n299 \n300 \n301 \n302 \n303 \n304 \n305 \n306 \n307 \n308 \n309 \n310 \n311 \n312 \n313 \n314 \n315 \n316 \n317 \n318 \n319 \n320 \n321 \n322 \n323 \n \nSix of the seven species exposed showed a significant (P<0.05) increasing linear \nrelationship with AOT024hr (Table 2).  The only species not to show a significant \nrelationship was P. erecta from the fen.  When considering the percentage variance in \nthe relative senescence that could be explained by ozone dose for the six species that \ndid show a significant difference, at least 70% of the variation could be explained by \nthe increasing ozone dose (Table 2). \n \nChlorophyll content of non-senescing leaves \nSpecies tested for their chlorophyll content over the course of the experiment differed \nin their response to ozone exposure (Figure 2). M. caerulea showed no significant \ndifference between individuals exposed to high or low ozone but both sets of plants \nshowed a significant decrease in chlorophyll content over the four week exposure \nperiod (P<0.001).  P. erecta plants from both the fen and the bog showed a significant \nreduction in chlorophyll content when they had been exposed to elevated ozone by \nweek four of the experiment (P<0.05).  C. echinata plants showed a transient increase \nin week three in chlorophyll content in plants exposed to elevated ozone but this did \nnot continue to week four.  H. vulgaris plants showed significantly reduced \nchlorophyll contents in plants exposed to elevated ozone in weeks two, three and four. \n324 \n325 \n326 \n327 \n328 \n329 \n330 \n331 \n332 \n333 \n334 \n335 \n336 \n337 \n338 \n339 \n340 \n341 \n342 \n343 \n344 \n345 \n346 \n347 \n348 \n \nPlant biomass \nIn contrast to the increase in senescence, only M. caerulea showed a significant \ndecrease in above-ground fresh and dry weight at the end of the exposure period \n(P<0.05) (Table 3).  Of the other species tested, the above ground biomass of P. \nerecta from the bog exposed to high ozone was slightly lower and C. echinata \nbiomass exposed to high ozone was slightly higher when compared to their respective \ncontrols (P<0.1).  \n \n \nPlant decomposition \nCumulative carbon dioxide emissions from the decomposition of the five species used \nin the assay are shown in Figure 3.  Potentilla erecta plants from the fen that had been \nexposed to elevated ozone caused a significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions \nfrom peat after five days of aerobic decomposition (P<0.05) and emissions continued \nto be higher for the remainder of the assay (P<0.1).  Carbon dioxide emissions from \nP. erecta plants from the bog showed a similar trend although the differences were not \nlarge enough to be significant.  Carbon dioxide emissions from the other four species \ndid not differ according to past ozone exposure. \n \nTotal carbon and phenolic compounds after 10 days of decomposition were very \nsimilar from plants that had and hadn\u2019t been exposed to elevated ozone (Table 4) with \nonly total carbon from Festuca rubra showing a trend towards a reduction under \nelevated ozone (P<0.1).  This reduction in total carbon led to the proportion of carbon \nas phenolic compounds being increased under elevated ozone for F. rubra (P<0.1).  \nThe concentration of ammonium ions after 10 days of aerobic decomposition did not \nchange for any of the five species and the only difference in the concentrations of total \nnitrogen compounds was a trend towards a reduction under elevated ozone seen in the \nCarex echinata decomposition assay (P<0.1). \n349 \n350 \n351 \n352 \n353 \n354 \n355 \n356 \n357 \n358 \n359 \n360 \n361 \n362 \n363 \n364 \n365 \n366 \n367 \n368 \n369 \n370 \n371 \n372 \n \nOf the three enzymes whose activity was measured after ten days of decomposition, \nbeta glucosidase and N-acetylglucosaminidase showed significant differences with \nozone treatment (Table 5).  Phenol oxidase activity did not show any variation under \nelevated ozone, but within treatment variation was high and enzyme activity was very \nlow (data not presented).  Beta glucosidase activity showed a significant reduction \nunder elevated ozone in Molinia caerulea and Juncus subnodulosus (P<0.05 and \nP<0.01 respectively) and a non-significant reduction in C. echinata and F. rubra.  \nHowever, beta glucosidase activities increased under elevated ozone for the \ndecomposition assays using P. erecta from the fen and the bog (P<0.1 and P<0.05 \nrespectively).  A similar pattern was seen with N-acetylglucosaminidase; activities \nincreased in the assays for plants exposed to elevated ozone for P. erecta from the fen \nand the bog (P<0.1 and P<0.01) but decreased significantly for plants exposed to \nelevated ozone for J. subnodulosus (P<0.001), C. echinata (P<0.05), and F. rubra \n(P<0.05).  Enzyme activities in the slurry containing M. caerulea exposed to elevated \nozone showed a non-significant decrease (Table 5). \n \nDiscussion \nPlant senescence is defined as \u201cthe deteriorative processes that are the natural causes \nof death\u201d (Leopold, 1980) and is characterised by a decrease in leaf chlorophyll \ncontent and photosynthetic activity (Wingler et al., 2006).  Accelerated foliar \nsenescence is a common response for many plant species treated with elevated ozone \n(e.g. (Bergmann et al., 1999; Gielen et al., 2007; Mikkelsen and HeideJorgensen, \n1996; Paakkonen et al., 1996; Pell et al., 1997) and is often coupled with biochemical \nchanges within the plant such as increases in ethylene emission, a cause of senescence \n(Schraudner et al., 1997).  The link between ozone exposure and premature \nsenescence has been found to be more marked in Northern latitudes because summer \nnights are shorter meaning there is less time for plants to recover from ozone injury \nthrough the repair processes that are driven by dark respiration (De Temmerman et al., \n2002).  Northern latitudes are also characterised by cooler and more humid \nconditions, both of which tend to lead to higher levels of stomatal conductance and \nhence higher ozone uptake (Yamaji et al., 2003), meaning that wetland plants in \nNorthern latitudes are likely to be particularly affected by elevated ozone as they are \ncharacterised by high levels of stomatal conductance and leaf area (Power and \nAshmore, 2002).  This is shown in this experiment as all seven species showed an \nincrease in senescence over the 28 days of exposure.  For H. vulgaris and P. erecta \nplants from the bog, weekly differences in senescence were not significant over the \nexperimental period but the correlation with AOT024hr was significant, showing that \nas ozone dose increased the amount of senescence also increased.  This is in \nagreement with other experiments on the effects of ozone exposure on wetland plants \nwith five out of ten wet meadow species tested showing increased senescence \n(Franzaring et al., 2000) and five wetland species also showing increased injury under \nelevated ozone (Power and Ashmore, 2002).  The effects of elevated ozone on plant \n373 \n374 \n375 \n376 \n377 \n378 \n379 \n380 \n381 \n382 \n383 \n384 \n385 \n386 \n387 \n388 \n389 \n390 \n391 \n392 \n393 \n394 \n395 \n396 \n397 \nsenescence had been previously assessed for three of the species used in this \nexperiment: P. erecta, F. rubra and C. echinata (Hayes et al., 2006).  In that study, F. \nrubra and C. echinata had significant increases in senescence after ten weeks of \nozone exposure but P. erecta did not show as high an increase in senescence as found \nin this experiment (Hayes et al., 2006).  This is possibly because Hayes et al. (2006) \nused an episodic regime with a maximum concentration of 100ppb ozone over four \ndays per week whereas in this experiment the ozone concentration was around 140ppb \nin the treatment domes for five days out of seven.  As a further comparison, the \nelevated ozone treatment of Hayes et al (2006) had an AOT 40 (daylight hours) of \n18.3 ppmh accumulated over ten weeks, whereas in this experiment the AOT 40 \n(daylight hours) was 24.8 ppmh accumulated over only four weeks. \n398 \n399 \n400 \n401 \n402 \n403 \n404 \n405 \n406 \n407 \n408 \n409 \n410 \n411 \n412 \n413 \n414 \n415 \n416 \n417 \n418 \n419 \n420 \n421 \n422 \n \nThe increase in senescence caused by elevated ozone has also been shown to be \naccompanied by an increase in the nitrogen content of abscised leaves (Findlay and \nJones, 1990) which could have an effect on the subsequent decomposition of plant \nbiomass as more fertilisation has been found to speed up the decomposition of plant \nlitter (Allison and Vitousek, 2004).  In the current study, carbon dioxide efflux was \nincreased from plant material exposed to elevated ozone during the P. erecta \ndecomposition with a corresponding increase in hydrolase activity suggesting that \ninitial rates of decomposition had increased.  However, there was no change in the \nnitrogen content of the slurry.  Extra-cellular enzyme activity was found to decrease \nin the slurries containing M. caerulea, J. subnodulosus, Carex echinata and F. rubra \nthat had been exposed to elevated ozone suggesting a reduction in the decomposition \nof the plant material.  This is in agreement with previous work carried out on \nblackberry and broomsedge (Kim et al., 1998) that found exposure to elevated ozone \nreduced litter decomposition.  Exposure to elevated ozone also caused a reduction in \ndecomposition of soybean residues (Booker et al., 2005).  However, although \nhydrolytic enzyme activities were changed by exposure of the plants to elevated \nozone, phenol oxidase activity was unaffected, there were no significant changes in \nphenolic concentrations after ten days of decomposition and only F. rubra showed a \ndecrease in TC concentrations after elevated ozone.  This suggests that, in contrast to \nprevious results (Booker et al., 2005; Iglesias et al., 2006; Saleem et al., 2001), these \nplants did not upregulate their production of anti-oxidant compounds such as \nascorbate and phenolics. \n423 \n424 \n425 \n426 \n427 \n428 \n429 \n430 \n431 \n432 \n433 \n434 \n435 \n436 \n437 \n438 \n439 \n440 \n441 \n442 \n443 \n444 \n445 \n446 \n447 \n \nIn this experiment, the chlorophyll content of healthy leaves of P. erecta from the fen \nand the bog and H.vulgaris was reduced under elevated ozone.  In contrast, exposure \nto elevated ozone increased the chlorophyll content of healthy leaves in C. echinata.  \nA reduction in chlorophyll content in leaves exposed to elevated ozone was also found \nfor birch (Betula pendula) (Paakkonen et al., 1996) and strawberry (Fragaria vesca) \n(Ramo et al., 2007).  However, there was no change in leaf chlorophyll content in \nCentaurea jacea after exposure to elevated ozone (Ramo et al., 2006b).  This suggests \nthat reduction in chlorophyll content of healthy leaves is not always a symptom of \nozone damage.  Chlorosis, or the bleaching of chlorophyll during cell damage, has \nbeen seen under elevated ozone as a precursor to elevated senescence (Heath, 2008); \nover a longer experimental period it is possible that the percentage of senesced leaves \nwould have increased further. \n \nOnly M. caerulea plants exposed to elevated ozone showed a reduction in fresh and \ndry above-ground biomass compared to plants that received a constant 20ppb ozone.  \nThis is in contrast to previous published results (Franzaring et al., 2000) that found the \nbiomass of M. caerulea increased under elevated ozone.  The difference in findings \ncould be due to the type of ozone regime experienced by the plants; growth could be \nstimulated by moderate ozone exposure but reduced by higher ozone concentrations.  \nP. erecta showed a trend towards a reduction in dry above-ground biomass under \nelevated ozone, which is in contrast to the results of Hayes et al (2006) where P. \nerecta showed a non-significant increase in biomass under elevated ozone.  The \nresults of this experiment show that, as in previous studies (Davison and Barnes, \n1998), increases in senescence are not necessarily associated with reduction in plant \ngrowth, making it difficult when considering the wider ecological significance of \nelevated ozone.  This result has also been found for some herbs and grasses; enhanced \nvisible injury and senescence under elevated ozone did not necessarily lead to a \nreduction in biomass (Pleijel and Danielsson, 1997).  The overall lack of change to \nabove and below-ground biomass is unexpected as ozone exposure has been found to \ninhibit growth in a variety of species e.g. (Grantz, 2003; Grantz and Yang, 2000; \nHayes et al., 2006; Peltonen et al., 2005).  Inhibition of plant growth by ozone \nexposure may have been absent in this experiment because of the short-term nature of \nthe experiment and it could be that it takes longer for changes in biomass to appear.  \nIn some experiments, it has been found that the biomass allocation to plant roots is \nreduced under elevated ozone (Andersen, 2003; Grantz and Yang, 2000).  This may \nbe because allocation to the roots is dependent on the source strength (Andersen, \n2003) and plant repair after ozone exposure requires the diversion of fixed \ncarbohydrate from other plant sinks (Dizengremel, 2001).  This was not seen in this \nexperiment; again possibly because of the short time scale of the exposure period. \n448 \n449 \n450 \n451 \n452 \n453 \n454 \n455 \n456 \n457 \n458 \n459 \n460 \n461 \n462 \n463 \n464 \n465 \n466 \n467 \n468 \n469 \n470 \n471 \n472  \nConclusions 473 \n474 \n475 \n476 \n477 \n478 \n479 \n480 \n481 \n482 \n483 \n484 \n485 \n486 \n487 \n488 \n489 \n490 \n491 \n492 \n493 \n494 \n495 \n496 \n497 \nFrom this experiment it can be seen that wetland plant species are affected by ozone, \nwith senescence being increased under elevated ozone in all species studied.  \nHowever, plant biomass was only negatively affected in one species (M. caerulea), \nsuggesting that over short-term exposures, increases in senescence do not lead to \ndecreases in plant growth.  Chlorophyll content was affected in some species, with P. \nerecta plants from the fen and bog and H. vulgaris showing a decrease in chlorophyll \ncontent and C. echinata showing a transient increase.  This could have a negative \neffect on carbon dioxide fixation during photosynthesis if the chlorophyll content of \nhealthy leaves is reduced prior to visible senescence.  The results of the plant \ndecomposition suggest that the effects of elevated ozone on forb decomposition differ \nfrom the effects of elevated ozone on grass and sedge decomposition.  P. erecta plants \nshowed higher carbon dioxide efflux and higher rates of hydrolase activity whereas \nthe other species tested showed a non-significant decrease in carbon dioxide efflux \nand a decrease in hydrolytic enzyme activity.  If exposure to elevated ozone does \nchange the decomposition rates and enzyme activities in wetland areas it could change \nthe potential for wetlands to act as carbon sinks.  If plant decomposition increases \nmore carbon could be released at the end of the growing season; whereas if plant \ndecomposition is reduced more carbon fixed during plant growth could be stored.  \nHowever, for overall carbon storage to increase, it would be necessary for plant \nbiomass to be unaffected by exposure to elevated ozone over a longer period.  This \nseems unlikely and further studies are needed to fully comprehend the implications of \nrising ozone concentrations for wetland carbon cycling and storage. \n \n \nAllison, S.D., Vitousek, P.M., 2004.
