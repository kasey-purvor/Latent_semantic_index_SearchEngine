We examine these questions through a study of labor-related condi-\ntionality in International Monetary Fund ~IMF! loans+ Using new data from IMF\nloan documents for programs from 1980 to 2000, we test to see if citizens\u2019 economic\ninterests influence IMF conditionality+ We examine the substance of loan conditions\nand identify those that require liberalization in the country\u2019s domestic labor market\nor that have direct effects on employment, wages, and social benefits+ We find evi-\ndence that democratic countries with stronger domestic labor receive less intrusive\nlabor-related conditions in their IMF loan programs+We argue that governments con-\ncerned about workers\u2019 opposition to labor-related loan conditions negotiate with the\nIMF to minimize labor conditionality+ We find that the IMF is responsive to domes-\ntic politics and citizens\u2019 interests+\nMany scholars, policymakers, and citizens believe that international organizations\n~IOs! constrain domestic policy+ Recent developments, such as the International\nMonetary Fund ~IMF! loan programs in Ireland and Greece, seem to support this\nconventional wisdom, since they stipulate policy reforms that must be undertaken\nby the Irish and Greek governments to receive vital monies from the IMF+Although\nIOs may constrain domestic policy, they do not do so equally in all countries+ The\nIMF, for example, requires more extensive policy reforms in some countries than\nin others+ Explaining this variation is integral to understanding how IOs influence\nthe formulation of domestic policy+\nAuthors are listed in order of relative contribution+ We thank research assistants Jacob Westlund,\nDong Fang, Susan Kang, and Mark Gough, and the Pennsylvania State University\u2019s College of the\nLiberal Arts and the University of Minnesota\u2019s MacMillan Travel Fund for research support+ For invalu-\nable suggestions and encouragement, we also thank Todd Allee, Lawrence Broz, Mark Copelovitch,\nAxel Dreher, Steph Haggard, Daniel Y+ Kono, David Lake, Sara McLaughlin Mitchell, Chad Rector,\nDavid Singer, Randy Stone, and Jim Vreeland+ Supplementary

doi:10+10170S0020818311000348\nWe argue that the extent to which IOs influence domestic policy depends, in\npart, on domestic interests+ For example, Greek citizens poured into the streets to\nprotest the austerity policies that were expected to accompany an IMF loan+\nAlthough the agreed-upon loan conditions stipulated significant policy reforms,\nimportant compromises were made\u2014the lowest-paid workers received protection\nfrom the cuts in public-sector wages and pensions, and no binding conditions were\nset for state employee layoffs or controls on private-sector wage increases+1 These\ncompromises were, in part, a response to the public protests by Green citizens+\nThe Greek case points to the importance of considering domestic interests as a\npotential determinant of international negotiations\u2019 outcomes+ To this end, we\nexplore when and under what conditions citizens\u2019 interests influence negotiations\nbetween national government executives and IMF staff+ Specifically, we examine\nthe extent to which workers\u2019 interests shape IMF loan conditions+\nThe IMF is often at the center of debates about the role of citizens\u2019 interests in\ninternational negotiations+ Although citizen groups are frequently assumed to be\nunable to significantly influence IMF policy, we find evidence that the economic\ninterests of an important group of citizens, namely workers, can influence IMF\nloan conditions+ Among democratic countries that borrowed money from the IMF\nbetween 1980 and 2000, those with stronger domestic labor received less-intrusive\nlabor-related conditions ~that is, conditions that stipulate domestic labor market\nreforms!+ When workers have the potential to be politically powerful, govern-\nments not only negotiate with the IMF to minimize labor-related conditions, but\nthe IMF is also more likely to accede to these demands+\nThis finding has several important implications for studies of IMF conditional-\nity and international organizations more generally+ First, governments facing pow-\nerful labor at home receive fewer and less intrusive labor-related loan conditions\nby leveraging their opposition to reforms as bargaining chips in international nego-\ntiations+ This finding confirms the logic of Putnam\u2019s two-level game and Milner\u2019s\nargument that domestic actors\u2019 preferences shape the terms of international coop-\neration+2 It also raises questions about precisely when and under what conditions\ngovernments use IOs as \u201cpolitical cover\u201d to enact unpopular policy reforms+\nSecond, citizens\u2019 interests matter for international negotiations even during times\nof crisis+When a national government faces an economic crisis, domestic workers\nare particularly vulnerable+ Workers might be made to bear the brunt of the costs\nof adjustment and governments desperate for IMF funds may be unable or unwill-\ning to push workers\u2019 interests at the bargaining table+ However, our results sug-\ngest that even in such times, workers can defend their interests+ Democratically\nelected governments will negotiate with the IMF on

influ-\nence countries\u2019 compliance with WTO rules,3 our study suggests that citizens\u2019\ninterests may also influence the terms by which countries join the WTO+ Acces-\nsion agreements affect the magnitude of the increase in trade that countries receive\nfrom WTO membership+4 Citizens\u2019 interests may therefore play a critical role not\nonly in negotiations with IOs and but also in the benefits from IO membership+\nA third, related implication is that domestic interests condition the relationship\nbetween IOs and domestic policy reform+ Loan programs vary in the intrusiveness\nof their loan conditions, and this variance is in part a product of the political power\nof domestic interests+ If we wish to understand how IOs affect specific domestic\neconomic and political outcomes, the missing link of citizens\u2019 interests is a crucial\nmediating variable+\nLabor Conditions in IMF Programs\nLoan conditions stipulate policy reforms that borrowing countries must undertake\nto receive IMF funds5 and are ultimately an outcome of negotiations between\nnational governments and the IMF staff+ Governments may choose to represent\nthe interests of their citizens at the bargaining table+ For example, governments\nmay leverage citizens\u2019 opposition to a proposed loan condition as a bargaining\nchip in their negotiations with the IMF+ In this case, citizens\u2019 interests will be\nreflected in the loan conditions+ However, the extent to which citizens\u2019 interests\nactually influence loan conditions remains unknown, despite the large and still\ngrowing literature on IMF conditionality+\nThe paucity of research about the role of citizens\u2019 interests in IMF negotiations\nis due, in part, to data limitations+ The IMF only recently made details of its loan\nprograms publicly available and easily accessible+ For every loan, there exist mul-\ntiple documents containing vast quantities of detail+ Previous studies have quanti-\nfied this immense amount

Since then,\nhowever, the number of labor conditions has increased significantly+ On average,\nabout a quarter of the IMF programs after 1987 have labor conditions+ Labor con-\nditionality reached a sample peak in 1999 when nearly 44 percent of all IMF pro-\ngrams included at least one labor condition+\nAlthough labor-related conditions are increasingly frequent in IMF programs,\nlabor conditionality varies considerably from country to country+ Even at their most\nfrequent in 1999, the majority of countries under IMF programs did not face labor\nmarket reform conditions+ Why do some countries\u2019 programs include labor condi-\ntions while others do not? Why do some countries receive far more intrusive labor\nreform conditions than others? We argue that this variation is due, in part, to cit-\nizens\u2019 interests and the role they play in negotiations between national govern-\nments and IMF staff+ But first we briefly review existing explanations for variation\nin the total number of loan conditions across countries+\nExisting Explanations\nPrevious studies of conditionality have generally offered three explanations for\nwhy some countries receive more IMF conditions than others+ The first focuses\non the potential importance of domestic institutions and political constraints, spe-\n7+ Only performance criteria are included+ These conditions are generally considered the strongest\nform of conditionality because they must be met in order for the loans to be disbursed ~unless the\nExecutive Board grants a waiver!+\n8+ Prior to 1987, the conditions imposed by the IMF followed a basic template+ Since then, the IMF\nhas expanded the scope and number of conditions for numerous issue areas, not just labor-related\nconditionality+ Pauly 1999+\n30 International Organization\ncifically institutional or situational factors that impel governments to pay greater\nattention to the policy preferences of the opposition parties+9 Some argue that\nhighly constrained governments will accept more conditions in order to evade\nthe constraints of domestic politics+10 Others argue that borrowing countries pre-\nfer fewer conditions and use domestic constraints to reduce the scope of\nconditionality+11\nA second explanation for the cross-national variation in the number of loan\nconditions focuses on a country\u2019s economic circumstances+ A country in severe\neconomic distress may receive fewer conditions in light of their dire economic\nsituation+12 However, some have argued that the most vulnerable countries receive\n9+ Pop-Eleches 2009+\n10+ See Vreeland 2003 and 2006+\n11+ See Krasner 1985; and Dreher and Vaubel 2004+\n12+ Stone 2008+\nFIGURE 1.

and Kono 2008+\n33+ Schelling 1960+\n34+ Mansfield, Milner, and Rosendorff 2002, 478+\nInternational Negotiations and Domestic Politics 35\nhard on labor conditions, since workers are unlikely to mount disruptive protests\nthat could derail the reform program or jeopardize the government\u2019s survival or\nreelection+\nOur argument challenges claims that governments seek out high conditionality\nin order to bind themselves to painful reforms in the face of strident domestic\nopposition+ Ramcharan, for example, argues that IMF conditionality increases the\ncost of opposing domestic reform, since derailing reforms could result in a sus-\npension of the IMF program+35 As Vreeland notes, however, binding oneself is\nrisky if the costs of suspending an IMF program are low for the opponents of\nreform+36 Since workers are made worse off by intrusive labor reform conditions,\nthe reduction in workers\u2019 incomes as a result of labor market reforms may offset\nany potential aggregate benefits to the country\u2019s economy+ Given this, the costs of\nrejecting an IMF program with intrusive labor conditions may be relatively low\nfor workers+ Union leaders who acquiesce to IMF programs with stringent labor\nconditions may face a revolt by their members+ Governments that agree to such a\nprogram risk labor unrest and losing popular support+ Therefore, governments fac-\ning powerful labor will accept fewer and less intrusive labor-related conditions\nthan governments facing weak labor+\nGiven that the IMF commonly advocates conditions that workers oppose, why\nwould the IMF ever agree to less intrusive labor conditions? First, the IMF may\nwant to appear responsive to domestic interests+ Paragraph four of the 1979 guide-\nlines on conditionality includes language suggesting that the IMF should pay due\nregard to the country\u2019s social and political objectives, economic priorities, and\ncircumstances+37 By reducing the intrusiveness of labor market reform conditions\nin countries with powerful domestic labor, the IMF demonstrates sensitivity to the\npolitical realities in borrowing countries+ Second, the IMF wants its programs to\nbe successful and success depends on implementation\u2014powerful domestic actors\ncan thwart the implementation of IMF conditions+38 According to one IMF study,\nonly 25 percent of structural adjustment programs between 1986 and 1997 were\ncompleted without interruptions+ Domestic political constraints such as political\nupheavals, flagging commitment from the authorities ~often a consequence of dif-\nficulty in mustering political support for new policies!, and opposition from domes-\ntic interest groups played a role in most of the program interruptions+39 Because\nthe IMF is interested in maximizing the success0implementation of its programs,\nthe organization is unlikely to require highly intrusive labor market reforms in the\nface of powerful domestic labor+\n35+ Ramcharan 2002+ Remmer 1986 and Edwards and Santaella 1993 make a similar argument\nalthough they focus more on the utility of scapegoating the IMF+ Putnam 1988 also argues that an IMF\nprogram can tip the balance in favor of economic reform+\n36+ Vreeland 2003, 63\u2013

hypotheses:\nH1: Among countries under IMF programs, those with powerful domestic labor\nwill tend to have less intrusive labor conditions than those with weaker labor.\nH2: Among countries under IMF programs, the influence of domestic labor on the\nintrusiveness of labor conditions will be greater in democracies than autocracies.\nWe pursue two strategies for substantiating these hypotheses: case studies and\nstatistical tests+ The case study of South Korea, followed by a short contrast with\nthe case of Bolivia, maps out the causal dynamics that underlie the statistical mod-\nels, providing a rich picture of how labor opposes IMF labor-market reform con-\nditions, how national governments respond to labor, and the IMF\u2019s support for\ngovernment efforts to integrate labor into the reform process+ Statistical analyses\nthen provide a rigorous empirical test of our argument\u2019s plausibility+\nCase Study: South Korea\nThe Asian financial crisis struck South Korea in late 1997+ The South Korean gov-\nernment appealed to the IMF for an emergency bailout program, and in December\n1997, the IMF initiated a three-year standby arrangement+ South Korea underwent\nseven IMF reviews during this period+Although these reviews contained a consid-\nerable number of performance criteria, there were few labor-related conditions+40\nAmong other things, the rescue plan called for restructuring of the financial sector\nand the chaebol ~large family-controlled conglomerates!, which entailed closing\ncompanies, privatizing state banks, and forcing the chaebol and state enterprises\nto compete on the market without state subsidies+ The IMF program would result\nin massive layoffs in the private and public sectors+ Although temporary workers\nwere already a large component of South Korea\u2019s workforce,41 much of the required\nshedding of workers would be in firms that employed permanent workers+ Exist-\ning law did not permit employers to lay off permanent workers until early 1999,\nwhich meant that mass layoffs could not take place immediately unless South Korea\namended its labor laws+42 Firing costs were high by international standards, so\nlayoffs would require employers to make significant payments to workers+43\n40+ In the seven reviews, only four letters of intent set performance criteria on labor-related issues,\nand all were for privatization+ One contained soft conditionality on labor market flexibility, another on\nprivatization and public-sector employment, and another on privatization+\n41+ Kim and Park 2006+\n42+ In December 1996, a new law was enacted that, among other things, permitted layoffs for eco-\nnomic reasons+ As a consequence of labor protests, however, a two-year delay for this provision was\nwritten into the revised law that was passed in March 1997+\n43+ Caraway 2009+ For workers with twenty years\u2019 tenure, firing costs were nearly two years\u2019 salary\n~ninety-one weeks!+\nInternational Negotiations and Domestic Politics 37\nSince the success of the program depended on labor bearing much of the bur-\nden of adjustment, organized labor\u2019s strength in South Korea posed an obstacle to\nthe IMF program\u2019s implementation+ The unionization rate in 1998 was 13+8 per-\ncent of the regularly employed, nonagricultural workforce+44 Although low by West-\nern European standards, this figure is quite high for non-European nations+ Union\norganization is also highly concentrated+ Most unionized workers belong to the\ntwo peak federations, the Federation of Korean Trade Unions ~FKTU! and the\nKorean Confederation of Trade Unions ~KCTU!, and the unionization rate is far\nhigher in the chaebol+ Unions are therefore strongest in the most strategically impor-\ntant sectors of the economy+ In addition, Korean unions actively exercise their\ncollective power in protests and strikes+45\nThe government and the IMF fully expected labor to oppose the reforms+ The\nissue of layoffs was particularly important, since the restructuring of public enter-\nprises and the chaebol would be hampered if businesses could not lay off work-\ners+46 Worker discontent over labor law revisions that liberalized layoffs were one\nof the core issues of the month-long national strike that took place just months\nbefore the Asian financial crisis hit+47 Given this recent history, the incoming gov-\nernment recognized that the IMF program would provoke fierce resistance from\nlabor unions and that the government needed to secure their assent if the reform\nprogram was to succeed+48 Immediately after the election, president-elect Kim Dae-\nJung met with union leaders and proposed the formation of a tripartite commis-\nsion in hopes that the government, employers, and unions could conclude a social\npact, based on the principle of fair burden sharing, to navigate the crisis+49 Unions\nwere eager to participate+50 The commission formed in mid-January 1998, and in\njust three weeks, it reached an agreement+51 Labor made important concessions,\nagreeing to allow employers greater scope in the use of temporary workers and\nmost importantly, immediate layoffs of permanent staff not only for corporate emer-\ngencies but also for mergers, acquisitions, and corporate restructuring+ In return,\nunions secured some long-desired improvements in basic labor rights and the expan-\nsion of the unemployment insurance system+52 In addition, employers had to fol-\n44+ Koo 2001+\n45+ See ibid+; and Lee 2006+\n46+ See Kim and Moon 2000; and Koo 2001+\n47+ See Kim 1998; Gills

have strong links to labor unions and neither of the\npeak federations mobilized their members to support his candidacy+ Until recently, when the KCTU\nestablished its own party, none of the major parties in South Korea took up labor issues or had insti-\ntutionalized links to unions+ Most parties in South Korea are regionally based+ Lee 2011+\n50+ Baccaro and Lim 2007+\n51+ Choi 2002+\n52+ See Kim and Moon 2000; Koo 2000; Choi 2002; and Bramble and Ollett 2007+ Unemployment\ninsurance was extended to include firms with fewer than thirty employees+ In 1997, only 7+8 percent of\n38 International Organization\nlow strict notification policies for laying off workers and laid-off workers were\nstill entitled to generous severance pay+\nHowever, the agreement was rejected by many parts of the KCTU, which\npromptly voted out its leadership and withdrew from the negotiations at the tripar-\ntite commission+53 The government revived the tripartite commission later in the\nyear to negotiate the restructuring of public-sector utilities and state-owned enter-\nprises; discussions were fractious, with both trade union confederations and even\nemployers withdrawing from

cities, and staging\na two-month sit-in strike at Hyundai Motors, a subway worker walkout, and mas-\nsive mobilizations by finance industry workers in response to layoffs+55\nThe IMF recognized the delicacy with which the adjustment program had to be\ncarried forward and stressed the importance of maintaining \u201csocial consensus and\nstability\u201d during the reform process+56 In a program that had numerous structural\nperformance criteria, the IMF program had few labor conditions+ The IMF did not\nask for lower severance payments or less time-consuming procedures for mass\nlayoffs, even though it supported such policies; it also used a light touch on pri-\nvatization and even supported some deficit-financed compensatory programs to\nlessen the pain of adjustment on workers+57 In a column in the Korea Times, Man-\naging IMF Director Michel Camdessus applauded the labor movement for its\nhigh sense of responsibility in working with the government and business\nunder the

to restructuring, something\nthat Koreans know all too well these days+ + + + That is one reason the IMF\nhas encouraged the Korean government to take every possible step to ease\nthe burden of

Politics 39\nIn a staff report published in 2000, the IMF also noted the importance of the tri-\npartite commission\u2019s work and supported government subsidies to firms that opted\nto retain rather than layoff workers+59\nGiven the power of unions, policymakers knew that strict conditionality on labor-\nrelated policies had the potential to backfire+ By refraining from setting tough labor-\nrelated conditions, the IMF gave the Korean government greater flexibility in\nnegotiating the restructuring process with unions and employers+ Such flexibility\nwas necessary because Korea\u2019s labor unions had the potential to wreak havoc, and\nin a democratic setting, citizens and workers had the capacity to derail unpopular\npolicies in the streets and at the ballot box+ Such an outcome not only threatened\nthe success of the IMF program but also the popularity of the government+ In the\nend, the IMF got many of the policy changes it wanted, even though it did not\nimpose intrusive labor conditions+ Policies agreed to through a relatively consen-\nsual process, and without the threat of punitive conditionality hanging over its\nhead increased the probability that the reforms to which the government commit-\nted would be implemented successfully+\nCase Study: Bolivia\nThe South Korean case study illustrated some of the dynamics through which we\nhypothesize that strong labor results in less intrusive labor conditionality+ The flip\nside of this argument is that countries with weak labor are more likely to have\nsubstantial labor conditionality in their IMF programs+ Bolivia, which was under\nan almost continuous sequence of IMF arrangements from 1986 through 2000,\ndemonstrates how democratic governments facing weak labor movements are more\nwilling to accept numerous labor-related conditions+60 According to the IMF, struc-\ntural reforms in the country during this period \u201cwere among the most extensive of\nany Latin American country+\u201d61 During this period, IMF programs contained numer-\nous benchmarks and performance criteria pertaining to privatization, public-sector\nemployment, public-sector wages, pensions, and labor-market flexibility+\nOne reason that the government agreed to such intrusive labor conditionality is\nthat labor was weak in Bolivia+ Although historically labor had been quite strong\nin Bolivia, by the early 1980s, the union movement entered a profound period of\ndecline+62 The privatization and decline of Bolivia\u2019s mining sector, combined with\nincreases in informal and urban unemployment, undercut labor\u2019s strength+ Conse-\nquently, by the time the IMF began pushing labor market reforms in the late 1980s,\n59+ IMF 2000+\n60+ The brief exception was between June 2002 and April 2003+\n61+ IMF 2005, 3+\n62+ See Dunkerley 1990; and Klein 1992+ From the 1950s through the early 1980s, the organiza-\ntional strength and political ties of the labor movement compensated for its structural weakness, and\nthe Bolivian labor movement was considered one of the better organized and more militant labor move-\nments in the region+ See Klein 1992; and Alexander 2005+\n40 International Organization\nthe Bolivian labor movement had lost much of its organizational strength, leaving\nit incapable of mounting a viable resistance to the reforms proposed by the IMF+63\nFacing little threat from a weakened labor movement, the government accepted\nlabor-related conditions with little fear that workers would derail the reform pro-\ngram+ Similarly, the IMF was more willing to ask for these conditions, since the\ngovernment was not threatened by labor+\nNo doubt, other factors also contributed to the exceptionally high level of intru-\nsive labor conditionality+ Bolivia was an extremely indebted small country with\nlarge fiscal deficits at the time of the reforms+ The legacy of the 1952 left-oriented\nrevolution included a large public sector and decidedly protective labor legisla-\ntion+ Not only public utilities, but also mineral extraction and other productive\nenterprises were in state hands+ Bolivia had among the highest firing costs in Latin\nAmerica+ All these factors made the country a prime target for deep IMF market-\noriented reforms+ The IMF had a strong incentive to pursue highly intrusive labor\nreforms, and the government faced a weak and fragmented labor movement that\nposed little threat to its survival+\nTo summarize, South Korea demonstrates how a relatively strong labor move-\nment was able to moderate IMF labor conditionality during an economic crisis,\nwhile Bolivia displays how a weak labor movement in a country with deep eco-\nnomic imbalances resulted in highly intrusive conditionality+\nQuantitative Evidence\nUsing new data from IMF loan documents for countries under IMF programs\nbetween 1980 and 2000, we construct a measure of the \u201cintrusiveness\u201d of labor\nconditions+ First, labor conditions are identified in key IMF loan documents includ-\ning letters of intent and arrangement letters+ Letters of intent are prepared by the\nborrower in consultation with the IMF+ They are usually, but not always, called\nMemoranda of Economic and Financial Policy+Arrangement letters are essentially\nthe contract for the loan+ They spell out the conditions that a country must meet in\norder to receive the next loan disbursement+ Because the terms of the arrangement\nletters change over the course of the loan, we code every arrangement letter+\nThis is an important empirical innovation+ Previous studies focus almost exclu-\nsively on the letters of intent+ However, the letter of intent is often used to lay out\nthe entire policy program and in some cases, even includes technical assistance,\nadvice, and policy priorities at other international financial institutions, such as\nthe World Bank, regardless of whether the IMF has the intention to make these\nconditions for its financing+64 In contrast, the arrangement letter spells out only\nthose reforms that the IMF intends to make conditions for financing+Arguably, the\n63+ See Tapia 2004; and Kohl and Farthing 2006+\n64+ IMF 2001+\nInternational Negotiations and Domestic Politics 41\nconditions in the arrangement letters are the most relevant for national govern-\nments, investors, and citizens+ We test for and find important substantive differ-\nences between conditions included in the loan contracts and the letters of intent+\nUsing the letters of intent and the arrangement letters, we identify conditions in\nnine issue areas relevant for labor, including wage levels and labor market flexi-\nbility+ For a complete list of all nine issue areas, see the appendix+\nEach labor condition is weighted by its relative stringency+ Performance criteria\nand prior actions are weighted most heavily ~by a value of 4!+ Prior actions out-\nline steps that a country must take before the IMF agrees to a loan ~or completes a\nreview!+ Performance criteria are conditions that a loan recipient has to meet; fail-\nure to do so results in the loan\u2019s suspension+ Benchmarks and indicative targets\nare weighted less heavily ~by a value of 3!+ Benchmarks are conditions that the\nIMF expects countries to meet, but failure to do so does not result in a suspension\nof the loan+ Indicative targets are similar to benchmarks, except that they are quan-\ntitative ~for example, a ceiling on the public wage bill!+ Soft conditions are weighted\nless heavily than benchmarks and indicative targets ~by a value of 1! because there\nare no sanctions for failing to fulfill a soft condition+ Soft conditions refer to pol-\nicy steps that the IMF would like to see but that have no explicit conditionality\nattached to them+ Soft conditions are not included in the loan contract+\nThe dependent variable equals the sum of the total number of labor conditions\nin a country\u2019s loan program in a given year, where each condition is weighted by\nits relative \u201cintrusiveness+\u201d Thus, the dependent variable measures the intrusive-\nness or stringency of labor-related conditions in a country\u2019s loan program in a\ngiven year+ In general, labor conditions are more intrusive in the letters of intent\nthan in the arrangement letters, as reported in Table 1+ This reflects the fact that\nlabor conditions are frequently soft conditions that are not included in arrange-\nment letters+ Less than half of all labor conditions included in IMF programs from\n1980 to 2000 are hard conditions: 10 percent are performance criteria while 20\npercent are benchmarks+ Indicative targets are rare; only twenty-four labor-related\nindicative targets are included in IMF programs during this period+ Labor-related\nprior actions are also quite rare; only 5 percent of conditions in the sample are\nprior actions+\nAmong countries that received IMF monies between 1980 and 2000, 41 percent\nreceived no labor conditions in their loan contracts+ This includes, for example,\nSouth Korea+ At the other extreme, three countries received very intrusive labor\nconditions in their loan contracts+ For these three countries, the sum of all labor\nconditions included in the arrangement letters ~weighted by their intrusiveness!\nover the period from 1980 to 2000 is greater than sixty+ These high conditionality\ncountries include Bolivia, Chad, and Mali+\nMeasuring Labor Power\nTo test the hypotheses, we need a comparable measure of labor strength that cov-\ners our sample of 120 countries from 1980 to 2000+ However, measuring labor\n42 International Organization\nstrength is difficult, particularly in developing countries, which constitute the major-\nity of the sample+ Direct indicators of labor power, such as unionization rates, are\ngenerally not available+ Where unionization rates are available, it is not clear that\nthey are comparable across developing countries+ Some developing countries man-\ndate compulsory membership in unions+65 China, for example, has one of the high-\nest union density rates in the developing world yet labor has very little bargaining\npower+66\nTo overcome this data limitation, we use a proxy for labor power\u2014potential\nlabor power ~plp!\u2014that is comparable across developing countries and cap-\ntures the dynamic nature of labor\u2019s influence+ This measure, developed by Rudra,\ntakes the ratio of skilled to unskilled workers and multiplies it by one over the\npercentage of surplus labor+67 The first component of the plp measure is the ratio\nof skilled to unskilled workers+ Unskilled workers are those who have a primary\nor secondary education ~or less! and are likely to be employed in labor-intensive,\nlow-skill manufacturing industries+ In contrast, skilled workers have more than a\nbasic general education and are employed in high-skill manufacturing industries+\nWe use the classification scheme originally developed by Wood and Mayer and\nsubsequently used by Rudra to identify high-skill and low-skill industries in devel-\noping countries+68\n65+

marginal productivity+ As a result, surplus workers\nare not counted as part of the official unemployed+ This concept is operationalized\nby taking the total working-age population in a country ~aged between fifteen and\nsixty-five! minus the total labor force minus students enrolled in secondary and\ntertiary educations+ This total is taken as a percentage of the economically active\npopulation+\nTheoretically, the bargaining potential of labor is likely to increase with the ratio\nof skilled to unskilled workers and decrease with the size of surplus labor+ The\ntheoretical bases for the plp measure are Marshall\u2019s four conditions for labor power\nand Silver\u2019s marketplace bargaining power+ Marshall found that labor power\ndecreases when labor is easily replaceable+ The ease of replacing workers depends\non the level of unemployment ~or surplus labor! and their skill, which suggests\nthat labor\u2019s marketplace bargaining power in developing countries is influenced\nby the proportion of skilled and unskilled workers and surplus labor+69 Wright and\nSilver argue that skilled workers facing tight labor markets are more likely to form\nlarger, stronger, and more sustainable labor union organizations+70\nBy combining two measures of the structural conditions in labor markets, the\nplp measure estimates labor\u2019s marketplace bargaining power+ If labor is in a better\nposition vis-\u00e0-vis the market, and assuming that structural power allows labor to\nform stronger organizations, then labor is likely to have more bargaining power in\npolicy debates+ Empirical evidence supports this point+ For example, Rudra reports\na positive correlation between plp and McGuire\u2019s labor strength index that is equal\nto +61+ In our sample, we find a positive correlation between plp and union den-\nsity that equals +5+71\nControl Variables and Model Specification\nWe used PolityIV to measure the level of democracy in a given country+72 For\nease of interpretation, the PolityIV score is rescaled so that 0 is the minimum\nvalue indicating the most autocratic state and 20 is the maximum value indicating\nthe most democratic state+73 To test the conditional hypothesis ~H2!, an inter-\naction term equal to the product of democracy and potential labor power\n~plp!

where the dependent variable is the intrusiveness of labor conditions in\nloan contracts+ U+S+ allies receive no more ~or less! intrusive labor market reform\nconditions in IMF arrangement letters than non-U+S+ allies+ One interpretation of\nthis finding is that U+S+ influence does not extend to the actual loan contracts+\nWhile the United States may be able to influence the letters of intent, U+S+ influ-\nence over loan contracts appears to be more limited, at least with respect to labor\nmarket reform conditions+88 This finding may have important implications for our\nunderstanding of geopolitics\u2019 role in IMF lending+ It also points to the fact that\nfocusing only on the letters of intent may lead to incorrect conclusions about IMF\nconditionality and, in particular, the role of the United States in IMF lending+\nFiring costs are not a robust predictor of the intrusiveness of IMF labor condi-\ntionality+ Countries with strict labor market regulations ~that is, high firing costs!\nare no more likely to receive labor market reform conditions than countries with\nflexible labor markets ~that is, low firing costs!, controlling for labor power+ One\ninterpretation of this finding is that the IMF tends to suggest labor market reforms\nwhere they are most likely to be implemented ~that is, weak labor countries!, rather\nthan where firing costs are highest+\nTwo other robust results emerge from Table 2+ First, larger countries receive\nless intrusive labor conditionality, as demonstrated by the negative and significant\ncoefficients on gdp+ Second, labor conditionality increases over time as shown by\nthe positive and significant coefficients on the linear time trend+ This finding is\nconsistent with the previously observed and well-documented increase in the scope\nof IMF conditionality over time+89\n87+ See Thacker 1999; and Dreher and Jensen 2007+\n88+ Of course, this assumes that the United States has an interest in promoting labor-related condi-\ntionality+ Whether or not this is the case is an important question for future research+\n89+ Steinwand and Stone 2008+\n50 International Organization\nPossible Role for Ideology\nDemocratically elected governments are responsive to the potential power of labor+\nThis suggests a possible role for government ideology in negotiations between dem-\nocratic governments and the IMF+ For example, left governments may be particu-\nlarly beholden to workers for electoral support+ Labor power may therefore have a\nlarger reductive effect on labor conditionality in countries with left governments+\nAlternatively, all elected governments, regardless of ideology, are sensitive to elec-\ntoral politics and therefore may be responsive to labor\u2019s potential power+ By min-\nimizing the intrusiveness of labor conditionality, governments of all stripes gain\nincreased flexibility in navigating the path of economic reform+ Even those gov-\nernments who support policies that labor opposes may prefer to have the freedom\nto negotiate the required reforms without stringent labor conditions being imposed+\nTo test for the possibility that government ideology mediates the effect of labor\npower on labor conditionality, we reestimate all models with a variable that indi-\ncates the ideology of the national government+ The variable ~left! is a simple\ndummy variable coded 1 for left governments and 0 otherwise+ Because IMF pro-\ngrams are negotiated with the national executive, the measure of ideology is spe-\ncific to the executive+ Also included is an interaction term equal to the product of\nleft and plp+ The sample is restricted to only those countries in which the national\ngovernment is democratically elected ~that is, PolityIV is greater than 0!+ These\nresults are reported in Table 3+\nAs before, the unconditional effect of plp is negative and statistically significant\nfor both the letters of intent and the arrangement letters+ Higher values of plp cor-\nrespond with less intrusive labor market reform conditions, all else equal+ The esti-\nmated coefficient on left is statistically significant in column ~3! only+ This provides\nsome limited evidence that left governments are more resistant to labor market\nreform conditions than right0center governments+ However, both left and right0\ncenter governments are responsive to the potential power of domestic labor+ This\nis demonstrated by the estimated coefficient on plp in columns ~2! and ~4!+ In col-\numns ~2! and ~4!, the coefficient on plp reports the marginal effect of labor power\non labor conditionality in countries with right0center governments+ In these coun-\ntries, plp has a significant reductive effect on labor conditionality+ However, the\nreductive effect of plp is even greater in countries with left governments+ The coef-\nficients and corresponding standard errors for plp when left equals 1 are calcu-\nlated using the relevant elements of the variance-covariance matrix from columns\n~2! and ~4! and reported in Table 4+ plp has a larger reductive effect on labor con-\nditionality when left governments are in power, all else equal+ This finding pro-\nvides further evidence of the importance of domestic politics for IMF conditionality+\nRobustness Checks\nTo evaluate the robustness of our empirical results, we conduct a number of sen-\nsitivity analyses+ For example, we estimate a two-stage Heckman selection model\nInternational Negotiations and Domestic Politics 51\nTABLE 3.

are virtually identical to the\nnegative binominal results reported in Table 2+90 We also test to see if the key\nresults are sensitive to changes in dependent variable\u2019s coding+ The dependent vari-\nable is first recoded to include only public-sector ~or private-sector! labor condi-\ntions+ Then, the dependent variable is recoded to separate structural labor market\nreforms from stabilization reforms+ Across all variations of the dependent vari-\nable, we find strikingly similar results: higher values of plp correspond with less\nintrusive labor-related loan conditions+ However, there are some slight differ-\nences+ The magnitude of the reductive effect of plp is larger for private-sector\nlabor conditions than public-sector conditions+ The IMF may be more willing to\ncompromise on private-sector labor conditions than on public-sector labor condi-\ntions because private-sector labor conditions are often less critical for balancing\ngovernment budgets+ Again, these results are omitted due to space constraints but\nare available in the online appendix+\nIn sum, the reductive effect of plp on labor conditionality is robust to various\nspecifications of the dependent variable+ The key results are also robust to alter-\nnative model specifications including a two-stage Heckman selection model+\nReestimating the models using ordinary least squares regressions produces very\nsimilar results+ Furthermore, the key results are robust to the inclusion of country\nfixed-effects, the exclusion of the linear time trend, and the inclusion of a lagged\ndependent variable+Additionally, when the sample is restricted to only those years\nafter 1986, we find the same substantive results+\nConclusion\nCitizens\u2019 interests play an important role in negotiations between national gov-\nernments and international organizations+ This is true even in times of economic\ncrisis+ This study finds that the interests of a key group of citizens\u2014workers\u2014\ninfluence negotiations over IMF loans+ When negotiating loan conditions, demo-\ncratically elected governments press for workers\u2019 economic interests when workers\nare politically powerful at home+ By representing workers\u2019 interests at the inter-\n90+ The Heckman results are omitted due to space constraints but are available in an online appen-\ndix at www+journals+cambridge+org0ino2012001+ In the first-stage, total reserves in months of imports\nis the exclusion restriction used as a proxy for governments\u2019 liquidity concerns to predict participation\nin an IMF program+ Also included as explanatory variables in the first stage model are plp, democ-\nracy, un voting, gdp per capital ~log!, and debt ~all lagged by one year!+ debt and reserves are\nthe only robust predictors of participation in IMF programs+ Countries with strong domestic labor are\nno more ~or less! likely to enter IMF programs than countries with weak labor+ In the second stage, the\nintrusiveness of labor conditions are regressed on the same explanatory variables included in Table 2+\nThe unconditional effect of plp is negative and statistically significant at the +05 level+ When the inter-\naction term is included, the coefficient on democracy* plp is negative and statistically significant at\nthe +05 level+\nInternational Negotiations and Domestic Politics 53\nnational bargaining table, democratically elected leaders hope to maximize their\nchances of reelection and increase the likelihood of a successful IMF program+\nAs a result, labor-related conditions are relatively less stringent in IMF loan pro-\ngrams for democratic countries with politically powerful labor than in demo-\ncratic countries with weak domestic labor+\nThis research has several important implications for our understanding of\nIMF lending and international negotiations more generally+ First, this study\ndemonstrates that the IMF is sensitive to domestic politics and citizens\u2019 inter-\nests+ The IMF has often been criticized for applying one-size-fits-all economic\npolicy prescriptions without sensitivity to context and ignoring borrowers\u2019\ndomestic political constraints+91 Contrary to the IMF\u2019s institutional self-image as\ntechnocratic and apolitical, we find evidence that the IMF is responsive to domes-\ntic politics in borrowing countries and specifically the interests of workers+\nSecond, our results suggest that national governments tend not to use the\nIMF for political cover when they face powerful labor at home+ When labor is\nstrong, governments risk both their political survival and the derailment of the\nloan program by agreeing to the inclusion of intrusive labor reform conditions+\nLabor may prefer not to get a loan program at all than to accept a program with\nintrusive labor conditionality+ The combination of low rejection costs and politi-\ncal power allows labor to influence the negotiating posture of national govern-\nments and shapes the IMF\u2019s willingness to be more flexible about labor-related\nconditions+\nThird, since citizens\u2019 interests influence negotiations between government exec-\nutives and IMF staff, even in times of economic crisis, they likely play an impor-\ntant role in other international negotiations that occur in good times, such as\nnegotiations over membership in the WTO+ While previous research demonstrates\nthat workers\u2019 interests influence countries\u2019 compliance with WTO rules,92 this study\nsuggests that workers\u2019 interests may also influence the terms a country negotiates\nto join the WTO+ Countries\u2019 accession agreements determine the magnitude of\ntrade increases they receive from WTO membership+93 Domestic interests can there-\nfore play a critical role not only in negotiations with IOs but also in the benefits of\nIOs\u2019 membership+\nFourth, our argument also has implications for how domestic political con-\nstraints shape the bargaining power of national governments with IOs+ Putnam\nhas famously described these negotiations as a two-level game in which\nnational leaders must construct a domestic win-set to reach successful inter-\nnational agreements+94 As Putnam notes, when the cost of no agreement is small\nfor powerful actors, the domestic win-set shrinks in size+ However, as he further\n91+ See Meltzer 2000; Easterly 2001; and Stiglitz 2002+\n92+ Rickard 2009+\n93+ Allee and Scalera 2010+\n94+ Putnam 1988+ The essays in Evans, Jacobson, and Putnam 1993 apply the two-level game logic\nto a variety of international negotiations, including the IMF ~Kahler 1993!+\n54 International Organization\nnotes, domestic governments can use these domestic constraints as bargaining\nleverage in their international negotiations+ Our empirical results provide support\nfor these theoretical expectations+ When domestic governments face powerful\nlabor movements, they leverage this opposition as a bargaining chip in their\nnegotiations with the IMF+ By recognizing this domestic constraint and impos-\ning less intrusive labor-related conditions, the IMF contributes to the forma-\ntion of a larger domestic win-set and consequently a mutually acceptable loan\nprogram+\nOur results have important policy implications+ First, additional work on\nthe number and nature of special interest groups, their reaction to reforms\nenvisaged in IMF-supported programs, and inclusive negotiation processes\nmay help the IMF to design better programs and improve their probability\nof implementation+95 As some IMF scholars have noted, if countries are\nto \u201cown\u201d a program, more than just the government needs to be on board\nwith it+96 Second, our results suggest that those concerned with the contents\nof IMF programs and their effects on labor may be better served by working for\nthe promotion of democracy than for the reform of the IMF+ Because democrat-\nically elected governments are relatively more responsive to workers and their\neconomic interests vis-\u00e0-vis IMF loan conditions, democratic governments are\nmore likely to represent workers\u2019 interests when bargaining with the IMF over\nthe terms of their loan package and consequently may negotiate better deals for\nworkers+\nWork remains to be done to further our understanding of IMF lending and the\nrole of citizens\u2019 interests in international negotiations+ We have focused exclu-\nsively on the impact of domestic interests on conditionality+ However, domestic\ninterests may also matter for governments\u2019 compliance with IMF loan conditions+\nAlthough we leave the question of compliance for future research, the new data\ncollected as part of this study may be particularly useful for examining the fre-\nquency and distribution of compliance with labor conditions+\nA second important area for future study is the effect of IMF programs+\nMany previous studies estimate the effects of IMF programs on important\neconomic outcomes relevant for workers+ However, our research shows that\nnot all IMF programs contain labor-related conditions; the distribution of\nlabor reform conditions is neither randomly nor uniformly distributed across\nIMF programs+ IMF programs with labor conditions will likely have different\neffects than IMF programs without labor conditions+ To accurately estimate the\neffect of IMF programs on labor-related outcomes, such as wages, it is necessary\nto account for the systematic variation in labor market reform conditions demon-\nstrated here+\n95+ See Boughton and Mourmouras 2004; and Mayer and Mourmouras 2008+\n96+ See Mayer and Mourmouras 2002; Ivanova et al+ 2003; Vreeland 2003; Bird and

reports, and arrangement letters+\nIn this study, we focus exclusively on the letters of intent and arrangement letters+\nLetters of intent are prepared by the borrower in consultation with the IMF+ They are\nusually, but not always, called Memoranda of Economic and Financial Policy+ These doc-\numents present the borrower\u2019s analysis of the economic problems that the country faces\nand lays out the policies that it will carry out to address them+\nArrangement letters are essentially the contract for the loan+ They spell out the condi-\ntions that a country must meet in order to receive the next loan disbursement+ The terms of\nthe arrangement letters change over the course of the loan+\nFor loans of one year in duration, we coded the documents issued at the time of the\ninitial loan request+ For loans of more than one year in duration, we coded one set of doc-\numents per year, coding the documents that were issued about twelve months after the pre-\nviously coded report+ Consequently, we coded all arrangement letters but only a proportion\nof letters of intent and staff reports+\nLoan Types\nWe coded the following loan types: standby arrangements, extended arrangements, struc-\ntural adjustment and enhanced structural adjustment facilities, and poverty reduction and\ngrowth facility+\nCoding of Conditionality\nWe track four different types of conditionality that are weighted as follows:\n\u2022 Performance criteria: 4\n\u2022 Prior actions: 4\n\u2022 Benchmarks: 3\n\u2022 Indicative targets: 3\n\u2022 Soft conditions: 1\nLabor Issue Areas\nWe track nine issue areas and code each level of conditionality for each issue area+ If there\nare multiple actions at the same level of conditionality for a particular issue-conditionality\npair in a document, then we count it only once+ If there are performance criteria, bench-\nmarks, and0or indicative targets in an issue area in a document, then we do not code soft\nconditionality for that issue area in that document:\n\u2022 Public-sector wage levels\n\u2022 Public-sector employment levels\u2014includes capitalization and outsourcing0\ncontracting of functions formerly within a public enterprise\n56 International Organization\n\u2022 Privatization\u2014includes reorganization, denationalization, divestiture\n\u2022 Minimum wages\u2014private sector\n\u2022 Private-sector wage restraint other than minimum wages\n\u2022 Social security\u2014reducing social security provisions, including health care, disability\nprovisions, unemployment insurance, and payroll taxes\n\u2022 Public pension reforms\u2014reducing costs and changing public pension system\n\u2022 Labor market flexibility\u2014includes facilitating layoffs, reducing severance pay, the\neasing of limitations on fixed-term contracts, the easing of conditions for labor\nsupply0outsourcing, and rationalization, modernization, deregulation, or other \u201cgen-\neral
