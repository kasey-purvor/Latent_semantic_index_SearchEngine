Initiation of magmatism then migrated southwards, reaching northern\nTanzania by 5\u00b18Ma. This progressionwas accompaniedby a change in the nature of the lithosphere,\nfrom rocks of the Panafrican Mozambique mobile belt through reworked craton margin to rigid,\nArchaean craton. Magma volumes and the geochemistry of ma\u00aec volcanic rocks indicate that\nmagmatism has resulted from the interaction with the lithosphere of melts and\/or \u00afuids from one or\nmore mantle plumes. Whilst the plume(s) may have been characterised by an ocean island basalt-\ntype component, the chemical signature of this component has everywhere been heavily overprinted\nby heterogeneous lithospheric mantle. Primary ma\u00aec melts have fractionated over a wide range of\ncrustal pressures to generate suites resulting in trachytic (silica-saturated and -undersaturated) and\nphonolitic residua. Various Neogene trachytic and phonolitic \u00afood sequences may alternatively have\nresulted from volatile-induced partial melting of underplated ma\u00aec rocks. High-level partial melting\nhas generated peralkaline rhyolites in the south\u00b1central rift. Kenyan magmatismmay, at some future\nstage, show an increasing plume signature, perhaps associated ultimately with continental break-up.\nKEY WORDS: Plume\u00b1lithosphere interactions\nThe Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden are two arms of a\npostulated triple junction centred on the Afar region (Fig. 1).\nOceanic crust began to form under these arms c. 10Ma. The\nthird arm, the East African Rift System (EARS), extends\nsouthwards through Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania into\nMozambique. Whilst lithospheric extension is occurring\nbeneath the EARS, the rift has not developed to the stage of\nocean crust formation. The EARS has come to be seen,\ntherefore, as a prime location in which to investigate the early\nstages of continental break-up.\nThis review focuses on the magmatism of the Kenya Rift\nsection, used here to indicate that section of the EARS\nextending from northern Kenya to northern Tanzania. The\nprimary aim is to demonstrate the complex polybaric\nevolutionary history of the magmatism, starting with the\npostulated plume-induced generation of primary magmas by\nvariable degrees of partial melting of heterogeneous, metaso-\nmatised lithosphere, through to generation of salic magmas by\nassimilation\u00b1crystal fractionation processes over a range of\ncrustal pressures and by partial melting of crustal protoliths,\nalso over a range of pressures.\n1. Magmatism of the Kenya Rift\nVolcanism in the rift started c. 35\u00b130Ma in the Turkana region\nof northern Kenya (Fig. 1). This was followed by normal\nfaulting and extension, estimated currently to be 35\u00b140 km,\nwhich corresponds to a stretching (\u00ad -) factor of 1.6 (Hendrie\net al. 1994; Mechie et al. 1997). Since its inception, magmatism\nhas subsequently migrated southwards with time, reaching\nnorthern Tanzania c. 5\u00b18Ma. Extension in the central and\nsouthern parts of the rift also started later than further N,\nc. 10Ma, and has stretched the crust and lithospheric mantle\nby c. 10 km (\u00ad -factor of 1.1\u00b11.2).\nThe volume of ma\u00aec magma, including underplated\nmaterial, generated in the Kenya Rift since the Oligocene has\nbeen estimated at 924;000km3 (Latin et al. 1993). This volume\nis too large to have been produced entirely within (anhydrous)\nlithosphere, especially since the results of geochemical model-\nling provide good evidence for small melt fractions during\nmantle melting (Latin et al. 1993; Macdonald 1994; Mac-\ndonald et al. 2001), and the melt zone must have been actively\nfed by upwelling mantle material (Latin et al. 1993). The low\nFigure 1 Location map of the Ethiopian and Kenyan plateaux\n(dashed lines) and of Cenozoic volcanic rocks of the East African Rift\nSystem (black). The arrow shows the apparent migration as a result of\nplate movements of a mantle plume currently centred on Lake\nVictoria. From Macdonald et al. (2001).\nTransactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh: Earth Sciences, 93, 239\u00b1253, 2003 (for 2002)\nextension rates, the lengthy duration of the magmatism (c. 35\nmillion years), and the fact that volcanism pre-dated faulting\nby a few million years in both the northern and southern parts\nof the rift (Morley et al. 1992; Smith 1994; Ebinger et al. 2000)\nare consistent with the petrological evidence that elevated\nmantle temperatures were required in magma generation. The\npotential temperature of the anomalously hot mantle beneath\nthe axial part of the rift may be as high as 15008C (Mechie\net al. 1997); in contrast, Henjes-Kunst & Altherr (1992)\nassumed a potential temperature of 12808C beneath volcanic\n\u00aeelds on the eastern \u00afanks of the rift system.\nThe southerly propagation of magmatism was accomp-\nanied by a change in the nature of the lithosphere. The\nbasement geology of the rift (Fig. 2) can be divided into\nthree blocks or domains, striking approximately NW\u00b1SE\n(Smith & Mosley 1993). The oldest, and most southerly, is the\nArchaean Tanzanian craton, dating back to 2\u00a26\u00b12\u00a29Ga. To the\nN are the Panafrican Proterozoic rocks of the Mozambique\nmobile belt (800\u00b1400Ma). In an intermediate zone, the\nmargins of the craton were reworked, overthrust and buried\nby rocks of the mobile belt during a late Proterozoic col-\nlisional event.\nFigure 2 Structural framework and basement domains of the Kenya rift (from Macdonald et al. 2001, much\nsimpli\u00aeed from Smith & Mosley 1993): (a) thick lines are major faults; (b) N\u00b1S pro\u00aele of estimated depth to\nbasement along line of rift between X\u00b1X0 (in a).\nRAY MACDONALD240\nThe lithological heterogeneity, with a contrast between the\ncold, thick, rigid Archaean lithosphere and the thinner,\nanisotropic, warmer, mobile belt lithosphere, has strongly\nin\u00afuenced the rift\u2019s development (Smith & Mosley 1993;\nEbinger et al. 1997). For example, reactivation of the thrusts\nand shear zones affecting the reworked craton margin has\ncontrolled the location and geometry of graben structures and\nthe emplacement of magmas since early Miocene times (Smith\n& Mosley 1993; Smith 1994). Indeed, the rift is currently\npropagating along the old suture zone (Smith 1994; Birt et al.\n1997).\nMacdonald et al. (1994b) argued that the results of a variety\nof geophysical and geochemical methods were consistent with\na variation of lithosphere thickness from some 150km under\nthe craton to 100km beneath the mobile belt on the \u00afanks to\n50\u00b160 km under the rift axis. Using petrological evidence, Le\nRoex et al. (2001) suggested that the lithosphere beneath the\nsouthern Kenya rift is at least 75 km thick, precluding\ninterpretations of gravity data which call for asthenospheric\nupwelling to depths as shallow as the crust\u00b1mantle interface\n(Birt et al. 1997; Simiyu & Keller 1997).\n2. Deep crustal structure\nSummaries of the deep structure of the crust beneath the rift\nand its relationship to magmatism may be found in Smith\n(1994), Macdonald (1994), Macdonald et al. (1994b, 2001),\nMechie et al. (1997) and Mussett & Khan (2000). More\ndetailed accounts, particularly of geophysical studies, can be\nfound in two special issues of Tectonophysics (Prodehl et al.\n1994; Fuchs et al. 1997).\nCombined seismic refraction and wide-angle re\u00afection\npro\u00aeling has shown that there are signi\u00aecant variations in\nthe thickness of the crust both along and across the rift axis\n(Fig. 3). Along the axis, crustal thickness varies from 35km in\nthe S beneath Lake Naivasha (Fig. 4) to 20 km in the N\nbeneath Lake Turkana. The northwards decrease is accom-\npanied by a decrease in surface topography (from 2\u00b13 km to\n800m high), and increases in the width of the rift (from 50\u00b1\n75 km to 150\u00b1200km) and in estimates of the total amount of\nsurface extension (5\u00b110 km in the S, 35\u00b140 km in the N).\nBouguer gravity changes from \u00a1200\u00b1250mGal in the S to\n\u00a150mGal in the N, accompanying a variation in crustal\nthickness along the rift axis (Mechie et al. 1994). The variation\nFigure 3 Seismic models of crustal structure (a) along the axis of, and (b) across, the rift (KRISPWorking Party\n1991, \u00aeg. 3). See Figure 4 for locations.\nMAGMATISM OF THE KENYA RIFT VALLEY: A REVIEW 241\nin crustal thickness along the axis correlates with the thickness\nof a high-velocity layer (6\u00a28 km s\u00a11) at the base of the crust\n(Fig. 3a). The crust also thins towards the rift axis, from\n\u00b635km to c. 30 km (Fig. 3b).\nAlong the length of the rift, uppermost mantle Pn velocities\nare generally low, 7\u00a25\u00b17\u00a27km s\u00a11. Beneath the \u00afanks, the\nvelocities are normal, at 8\u00a20\u00b18\u00a22 km s\u00a11. The abrupt changes in\nPn velocities and depth to the Moho at the rift boundaries have\nbeen interpreted as an essentially vertical channel of anom-\nalous mantle beneath the rift axis, extending to 160km or more\n(Achauer & KRISP TeleseismicWorking Group 1994; Slack et\nal. 1994). By calculating the time in which the sharp\nboundaries would have been smeared out by diffusion,Mechie\net al. (1994) concluded that the heat anomaly has been present\nunder the apical part of the south\u00b1central rift for the past\n20Ma, i.e. for the duration of the Cenozoic volcanism.\nThe mantle velocity structure has been interpreted to show\nthat the depth to the onset of melting (or to the presence of\ndetectablemagma bodies) is \u00b665km beneath the northern part\nof the rift and somewhat shallower (45\u00b150 km) beneath Lake\nNaivasha (Macdonald et al. 1994b).\nSuperimposed on a c. 250mGal regional Bouguer anomaly\nover the EARS is a \u00a1190mGal gravity high centred on the rift\naxis, the greatest anomalies coinciding with young \u00f0 <0\u00a25Ma\u00de\ncentral volcanoes on the inner rift \u00afoor. Swain (1992)modelled\nthe axial high as resulting from pervasive dyke injection in the\ncentral 40 km of the rift, in which about 22\u00b126% (or a width of\n9\u00b110 km) of the present-day crust, down to a depth of 22 km,\nconsists of intruded material. Some 135; 000km3 of basaltic\nmaterial can potentially be located in the dyke zone.\nWithin the Kenya rift, the focus of Miocene\u00b1Pliocene\nvolcanism, rifting, the regional Bouguer gravity anomaly and\nFigure 4 Locality map of selected Quaternary volcanoes in the Kenya rift (slightly modi\u00aeed from Scott &\nSkilling 1999); triangles H and C represent the location of the Huri Hills and Chyulu Hills, respectively.\nRAY MACDONALD242\nthe zone of anomalous mantle material coincide with an area\nof crustal upwarping commonly referred to as the Kenya\nDome, the apical region of which lies near Lake Nakuru (Fig.\n4; Smith 1994). The Dome is associated with only minor\n\u00f0 <1 km \u00de amounts of uplift and is apparently in isostatic\nequilibrium, supported by the loading of anomalous mantle\nwithin the underlying lithosphere. The exact timing and\namount of the uplift are dif\u00aecult to establish. As we shall\nsee, the Kenya Dome was the focus of much of the Neogene\nmagmatism in the south\u00b1central part of the rift.\n3. Nature of mantle rocks\nDirect information on the composition of the sub-rift mantle is\nscanty, due to a scarcity of ultrama\u00aec xenoliths. Amphibole\nand phlogopite have been recorded in xenoliths at Lashaine,\nPello Hill and Deeti in northernTanzania, where they occur on\nthe craton (Dawson & Smith 1973, 1988; Johnson et al. 1997).\nKimberlites from Nyanza province, on cratonic crust in\nwestern Kenya, contain garnet-free harzburgite and dunite,\nwith amphibole and lesser amounts of phlogopite (Ito 1986).\nHenjes-Kunst & Altherr (1992) recorded phlogopite in a\nperidotite xenolith from the Chyulu Hills, in the reworked\ncraton margin. Other localities on the eastern \u00afank of the rift,\nwhich are in the mobile belt, carry ultrama\u00aec xenoliths with\neither no, or scarce, amphibole and\/or phlogopite (Suwa et al.\n1975; Henjes-Kunst & Altherr 1992).\nThe viability of these xenoliths as analogues for mantle\nbeneath the axial part of the rift may be questionable\n(Macdonald et al. 1994b). However, detailed geochemical\nmodelling of the generation of primitive alkaline lavas of the\nChyulu Hills Volcanic Province, which are characterised by\nstriking depletions in K relative to other highly incompatible\nelements, suggest that the source rocks contained amphibole,\nbut not phlogopite (Spa\u00c8 th et al. 2000, 2001). Since K depletion\nis a common, if not ubiquitous, feature of ma\u00aec rocks from the\naxial part of the rift (Macdonald et al. 2001), it seems\nreasonable to suggest that the mantle sources underlying the\nmobile belt, at least, comprise four-phase peridotite with small\n(\u00b95%) modal amounts of amphibole.\n4. Range of basaltic magmas\nBaker (1987) reviewed the complexity of magmatic associa-\ntions in the Kenya Rift, stressing that there is a continuum of\nma\u00aec compositions from nephelinites through basanites and\nalkali olivine basalts to hypersthene (hy)-normative basalts.\nThere are important differences in the proportions of more\nand less silica-undersaturatedma\u00aec rocks in each lithospheric\ndomain. Thus in a geochemical study of 185 ma\u00aec rocks\ncollected from the axial regions and shoulders of the rift,\nMacdonald et al. (2001) found that, in the craton, nephelinites\nand basanites formed \u00b9 80% of the samples and alkali olivine\nbasalts and hy-normative basalts \u00b9 20%: The corresponding\n\u00aegures for the reworked cratonmargin were 33% and 67%, and\nfor the mobile belt 21% and 79%. Since sampling was not\nrandom, these proportions are not strictly applicable but they\nare consistent with the distribution of magma types based on\n\u00aeeld mapping (Le Bas 1987; Smith &Mosley 1993; Smith 1994).\nOlivine-poor nephelinites (in association with carbonatites) are\nFigure 5 Ce\/Y\u00b1Zr\/Nb plot of ma\u00aec volcanic rocks from the axial region and shoulders of the Kenya rift,\nconstructed from a study of 185 samples by Macdonald et al. (2001). The continuous lines are non-modal\nfractional melting curves calculated by Hardarson & Fitton (1991) for four mantle compositions: SD, depleted\nspinel lherzolite; SP, primitive spinel lherzolite; GD, depleted garnet lherzolite; GP, primitive garnet lherzolite.\nNumbers on lines refer to percentages of melt. In the main diagram, all data are plotted, subdivided by structural\nsetting\/lithospheric domain: RCM, reworked craton margin; MB, mobile belt. In the inset, the average\ncompositions of each lithology in the reworked craton margin are shown: Ne, nephelinite; Bsn, basanite; AOB,\nalkali olivine basalt; HNB, hy-normative basalt.\nMAGMATISM OF THE KENYA RIFT VALLEY: A REVIEW 243\nlargely restricted to the craton and its reworked margins. In the\nmobile belt, olivine-rich nephelinitic volcanism tends to be\nassociated with large shield volcanoes and high-volume erup-\ntions of alkali olivine and hy-normativebasalts.The distribution\nmay be related to the presence of thinner lithosphere beneath\nthe mobile belt which, since it had undergone stretching and\nwarming during Cretaceous and Palaeogene rifting events, is\nmore easily eroded and penetrated by rising magmas.\nOn the basis of trace element evidence, Latin et al. (1993),\nMacdonald (1994) and Macdonald et al. (2001) inferred that\nthe majority of ma\u00aec magmas in the Kenya rift were generated\nin a melt zone extending across the transition from spinel to\ngarnet peridotite (see also Class et al. 1994; Le Roex et al.\n2001). This is exempli\u00aeed by a Ce\/Y v. Zr\/Nb plot (Fig. 5),\nwhere the continuous lines represent non-modal fractional\nmelting curves for partial melting of fertile and depleted\nvarieties of spinel and garnet peridotite. Macdonald et al.\n(2001) noted two particular features of the plot. Firstly, the\nsequence of the average compositions nephelinite> basanite>\nalkali basalt > hy-normative basalt, as exempli\u00aeed by rocks of\nthe reworked craton margin (Fig. 5, inset), seems to represent\nprogressively shallower melting (increased component of\nspinel-facies peridotite), rather than larger degrees of melting.\nHowever, the spread of data for each setting suggests variable\nmelt fractions. Latin et al. (1993) reached similar conclusions\non the basis of inversion of rare earth element concentrations\nin rift basalts. Secondly, the craton rocks appear, regardless of\nmagma type, to have been generated at the highest pressures\nand the mobile belt rocks at the lowest, although there is\nconsiderable overlap between magma types.\nCon\u00aermatory evidence for the relationship between degree\nof silica-saturation and pressure of \u00aenal equilibration comes\nfrom major element data, such as Al2O3 contents and\nCaO=Al2O3 ratios. The ratio is highly pressure-dependent,\nincreasing with increasedmelting\/equilibration pressure, whilst\nAl2O3 decreases (Herzberg 1995). Ma\u00aec rocks from the axial\nregion of the rift, with mg-number > 65 (where mg-number is\n100\u00a3Mg=\u00f0 Mg \u00fe Fe \u00de ) and thus potential primary mantle\nmelts, are plotted in Figure 6. Overall, the most silica-\nundersaturated, nephelinitic, lavas have the highest ratios\nand lowest Al2O3 concentrations; the hy-normative basalts\nhave the lowest ratios and highestAl2O3 concentrations.Lavas\nof the Huri Hills, on the eastern \u00afank of the rift (Fig. 4; Class\net al. 1994), and of the Chyulu Hills volcanic province (Fig. 4;\nFigure 6 CaO=Al2O3\u00b1Al2O3 plot for rocks from the axial region of the Kenya rift, inferred to be primary mantle\nmelts (mg-number >65). Data from Macdonald et al. (2001). Neph, nephelinite; Bsn, basanite; AOB, alkali\nolivine basalt; HNB, hy-normative basalt. The solid line with crosses represents the compositions of solidus\nliquids generated by partial melting of fertile peridotite. Numbers refer to pressures in GPa along the solidus\n(from Herzberg 1995). Compare with Spa\u00c8 th et al. (2000, \u00aeg. 11) for rocks of the Chyulu Hills Volcanic Province.\nRAY MACDONALD244\nSpa\u00c8 th et al. 2000, 2001) show similar relationships. These\nvariations reinforce the strong control exerted by depth\n(pressure) of melting on degree of silica-undersaturation.\nMacdonald et al. (1994b) brought together evidence from\nmantle structure and composition, basalt equilibration pres-\nsures and geophysical information to suggest a relationship\nbetween basalt composition, lithospheric thickness and depth\nto the spinel\u00b1garnet transition zone beneath the rift. Beneath\nthe Tanzanian craton, where geothermal gradients are lowest\nand the lithosphere is >140km thick, a proportion of the\nbasalts show garnet control and degrees of melting may be as\nlow as <1%. In areas, such as the eastern \u00afanks, where the\nlithosphere is c. 100km thick, melt fractions are in the range 1\u00b1\n3% and \u00aenal equilibration takes place over a wider depth\nrange, with many, perhaps most, basalts now showing a spinel\ncontrol. Lithosphere may locally be as thin as 35 km under the\nrift axis. Since the whole spectrum of ma\u00aec magmas can be\nclosely associated in the \u00aeeld, and have even been erupted from\nindividual axial volcanoes (Baker 1987), it may be inferred that\nthe melt column is longest under those parts of the rift system\nwhere heat \u00afow is greatest and the lithosphere thinnest.\nStudies of the spatial and temporal variation in basalt\ncomposition along the rift have shown that (1) most sectors of\nthe within-rift sequences show a decrease of silica-under-\nsaturation of ma\u00aec lavas with time; and (2) ma\u00aec lavas W and\nE of the rift are normally more silica-undersaturated than are\nlavas within the rift (Lippard & Truckle 1978; Truckle 1980;\nMacdonald et al. 2001). These trends are related to two effects:\nthe disappearance of nephelinites from the sequences and an\nincreasing importance of hy-normative basalts volumetrically.\nSince, at any speci\u00aec locality, magmatism has tended to\nmigrate towards the rift axis, the more silica-saturated rocks\nare concentrated towards the axis.\nMacdonald et al. (2001) have interpreted the time trends to\nindicate that soon after the commencement of magmatism in\neach sector of the rift, the melt column extended from the\ngeneration depths of nephelinites \u00f0 \u00b6100km \u00de to those of the hy-\nnormative basalts (<50km; Macdonald et al. 1994b). With\ntime, the column tended to move upwards, with cessation of\nnephelinitic magmatism and increasing relative abundance of\nalkali olivine basalts and hy-normative basalts. Spa\u00c8 th et al.\n(2000) have also documented a trend of decreasing silica-\nundersaturation with time in eruptive products of the\nQuaternary Chyulu Hills Volcanic Province, situated more\nthan 100km E of the rift valley in southeasternKenya (Fig. 4),\nwhich they ascribed to an age progressive decrease in the depth\nof melt generation and a coincident increase in the degree of\nmelting.\nThere are, however, several exceptions to the general rule\nthat basalt compositions become more silica-saturated with\ntime in speci\u00aec regions. For example, in the Huri Hills, a\nPliocene\u00b1Quaternary volcanic \u00aeeld situated on the rift \u00afank E\nof Lake Turkana (Fig. 4), there was a continuous change from\nolder alkali basalts to younger basanites (Class et al. 1994).\nThe change was accompanied by increasing abundances of\nincompatible trace elements and is perhaps best explained by a\ntime-dependent systematic decrease in the degree of partial\nmelting and possibly an increase in the depth of partial melting\n(and thus an increase in the proportion of garnet in the\nresidue). Class et al. (1994) recognise two chemically and\nisotopically distinct components in the magmas. The \u00aerst\ncomponent, most abundant in the older extrusives, has high\nBa\/Nb, K\/Th, Sr\/Nd and 87Sr=86Sr ratios, and low\n143Nd=144Nd and 206Pb=204Pb ratios. It was probably derived\nfrom the lithospheric mantle, although a plume source cannot\nbe excluded. The second component, which is more clearly\nseen in the younger extrusives, is characterised by relatively\nhigh 206Pb=204Pb ratios and may be attributed to a mantle\nplume.\n5. Comparisons with ocean island basalts\nUsing trace element data, Macdonald (1994) and Macdonald\net al. (2001) showed that there are notable compositional\ndifferences between the ma\u00aec rocks of the Kenya rift and\nFigure 7 Zr\/Y\u00b1Nb\/Y plot to show that many ma\u00aec rocks of the axial regions of the Kenya rift are depleted in Zr\nrelative to Nb compared to OIB (Macdonald et al. 2001, \u00aeg. 12).\nMAGMATISM OF THE KENYA RIFT VALLEY: A REVIEW 245\nocean island basalts (OIB). This is exempli\u00aeed in a Nb\/Y\u00b1Zr\/Y\nplot (Fig. 7); several rocks from each lithospheric domain have\nhigh values of Nb\/Y at a given Zr\/Y compared to OIB. The\ntrace element data are consistent with isotopic evidence against\na simple OIB-like source for the rift magmas (Paslick et al.\n1995; Kalt et al. 1997). However, the large degree of overlap\nbetween the Kenya and OIB compositions (e.g. Fig. 7)\nindicates some common source and\/or process and several\nrecent geochemical studies have concluded that the Kenyan\nma\u00aec magmas have resulted from the interaction of a plume\ncomponent similar to the source of OIB, and a strongly\nheterogeneous lithospheric component (Class et al. 1994;\nPaslick et al. 1995; Spa\u00c8 th et al. 2000, 2001; Kabeto et al.\n2001a; Le Roex et al. 2001; Macdonald et al. 2001).\nThere is considerable compositional variation within the\nmagma types, resulting from substantial decoupling of the\nincompatible trace elements (including K, Ti and P), re\u00afected,\nfor example, in the ranges of ratios (Fig. 7) and in different\nmantle-normalisedpatterns, even for rocks of the same magma\ntype from the same successions (Fig. 8). The variability in\nincompatible trace element ratios occurs in rocks ranging from\nnephelinitic to hypersthene-normative basalt in each litho-\nspheric domain, and in rocks with mg-number ranging from 40\nto 80. Macdonald et al. (2001) concluded that much of the\nvariability must be mantle derived and envisaged one or more\nof the mantle sources as being strongly heterogeneous on a\nlocal scale. Since compositional heterogeneities are unlikely to\npersist in convecting mantle, they inferred that the highly\nvariable component was metasomatised lithosphere.\nThe Sr andNd isotope systematicsof lavas from the rift valley\nprovide evidence that the compositional heterogeneity is at least\npartly related to one or more chemical fractionations (deple-\ntions) in the Proterozoic, and a series of metasomaticevents, one\nof which undoubtedly occurred shortly before and during the\nCenozoic activity, others of which may be the result of\nsubduction,accretion andmagmatic events related to Archaean,\nProterozoic and Panafrican orogenies (Norry et al. 1980; Cohen\net al. 1984; Davies & Macdonald 1987; Rehka\u00c8 mper et al. 1997;\nDawson & Smith 1988; Rudnick et al. 1993; Chesley et al. 1999;\nBurton et al. 2000; Spa\u00c8 th et al. 2000).\nThe Cenozoic enrichment process(es) probably involved\nmodal metasomatism, where metasomatic melts or \u00afuids,\npossibly plume-derived, in\u00aeltrated and pervasively modi\u00aeed\nthe subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM), precipitating\nminerals such as amphibole and apatite (Bedini et al. 1997;\nSpa\u00c8 th et al. 2000, 2001; Macdonald et al. 2001). The\nin\u00aeltration generated a melt accumulation zone at the\ntransition between adiabatic and conductive mantle, i.e. at\nthe base of the lithosphere. With melt\u00b1rock reactions at\nincreasing melt mass, this zone represents a potential source of\nmagmas with a lithospheric geochemical signature. As a\nconsequence of the continued rise of the plume, the regional\ngeotherm was raised, leading to generation of the rift magmas.\nThe concept of plume\u00b1lithosphere interaction is attractive\nfor the Kenya rift because, by assuming that the degree of\nin\u00aeltration by plume melts and of melt\u00b1rock reactions was\nhighly variable over short distances, it can generate signi\u00aecant\nvariation in incompatible trace element abundances in closely\nrelated rocks. Furthermore, locating the interaction zone close\nto the base of the SCLM would decrease the involvement of\nthe overlying lithosphere, producing primitive magmas with\nsimilar compositional characteristics being emplaced through a\nrange of basement types (Macdonald et al. 2001).\nIt is possible that carbonatites in the rift system, which are\nlargely restricted to areas of exposed Archaean rocks (Le Bas\n1987; Smith 1994), were generated entirely within the litho-\nsphere.Kalt et al. (1997) noted that the carbonatitecomplexes in\nthe EARS have been derived from small, isotopically distinct\nmantle sourceswhich cannot be described in terms of the mantle\ncomponents de\u00aened for OIB (and thus the inferred Kenya\nplume(s)). They suggested that the carbonatites were formed by\npartial melting of carbonated phlogopite and\/or amphibole-\nbearing peridotites in heterogeneouslithosphericmantle affected\nby enrichment and depletion processes at different times.\nAn alternative view is that the Nd\u00b1Sr\u00b1Pb isotope geochem-\nistry of the Kenyan carbonatites reveals mixing in a plume\nFigure 8 Mantle-normalised plots for \u00aeve, selected, Pliocene alkali olivine basalts from a geographically\nrestricted area just N of Lake Baringo (Fig. 4).

The role of the subcontinental\nlithosphere is then to concentrate volatiles at the upper levels\nof the ascending plume.\n6. Plume component and number of plumes\nThere is strong geophysical and geochemical evidence for the\ninvolvement of a mantle plume (the Afar plume) in the\ngeneration of the Ethiopian \u00afood basalts and the magmatism\nin Afar (Marty et al. 1996; Hoffman et al. 1997). There is,\nhowever, no consensus as to the number of plumes in\u00afuencing\nthe tectonomagmatic development of the Kenya rift, current\nestimates ranging from none (Bailey 1992; King & Ritsema\n2000), through one (though not necessarily the same one;\nEbinger & Sleep 1998; Birt et al. 1997; Mechie et al. 1997), two\n(Ebinger et al. 1989; George et al. 1998; Rogers et al. 2000), to\nthree (Burke 1996).\nThe source of the inferred plumes is being explored using\nseismic techniques, particularly seismic tomography. Lithgow-\nBertelloni & Silver (1998), Ritsema et al. (1999), Helmberger\net al. (2000), Zhao (2001) and Ni et al. (2002) have all imaged a\nvery large, low-velocity structure (>1000km; the so-called\nAfrican Superplume) extending obliquely from the core-mantle\nboundary beneath southern Africa into the uppermost mantle\nbeneath the EARS. Ni et al. (2002) suggest that the boundary\nof this anomaly is sharp, <50km wide. It is uncertain whether\nthe structure is thermal, chemical, or both, in origin.\nIn contrast, Nyblade et al.\u2019s (2000) preferred interpretation\nof variations in upper mantle seismic velocity beneath northern\nTanzania is that they can be attributed to a mantle plume\nwhose head is present under the keel of the Tanzanian craton.\nThey present evidence that there is a wide (several hundreds of\nkilometres) depression of the 410km seismic discontinuity but\nnot the 660km discontinuity, suggesting that the tail of the\nplume lies within the upper mantle. They envisage a lateral\n\u00afow of plume material along the eastern edge of the craton,\ngenerating lithospheric uplift across the East African Plateau.\nDecompressionmelting of hot plume material gives rise to the\nmagmatism of the EARS.\nThe strong lithospheric geochemical signature imposed on\nKenyan magmas makes identi\u00aecation of the plume component\nrequired by the eruptive volumes very dif\u00aecult. However, the\ncraton and mobile belt data have a common end-member at\n143Nd=144Nd \u00b9 0\u00a251275 and 87Sr=86Sr \u00b9 0\u00a27035 (Rogers et al.\n2000;Macdonald et al. 2001), this composition lying within the\nrange of OIB (Hofmann 1997). Furthermore, the majority of\nrift mantle-normalised incompatible trace element patterns are\nbroadly similar to OIB (Fig. 8) and it seems likely, therefore,\nthat any plume component had OIB-like characteristics. The\nextent of lithosphere interaction apparently has not varied\nsystematically in space or time, i.e. there has been no\nsigni\u00aecant change towards an increased mantle plume, or\nany other, component (Macdonald et al. 2001). If the south-\nwards initiation of magmatism in the Kenya rift has been\ncaused by the passage of the African plate over a plume or by\nplume migration, then the chemical signature of the plume has\nbeen overprinted by interaction with lithospheric mantle.\nChesley et al. (1999) have identi\u00aeed possible plume material\namong ultrama\u00aec xenoliths from the Labait volcano, which\nlies on the eastern boundary of the Tanzanian craton. They use\nRe\u00b1Os systematics of the xenoliths to propose that the\nlithosphere to depths of \u00b9140km is refractory harzburgite\nwhich, on the basis of Re depletion ages, was stabilised\nbetween 2\u00a25 and 2\u00a29Ga. Between \u00b9140km and 150km depth,\nthe peridotites are garnet-bearing, more fertile, deformed and\nhave more radiogenic Os than the overlying lithosphere. These\nperidotites may represent mixtures of ancient lithosphere and\nunderlying plume or younger (\u00b51Ga) additions to the base of\nthe lithosphere. One xenolith sample has the major element\ncomposition of primitive mantle and the radiogenic\n187Os=188Os ratio characteristic of plume-derived oceanic\nbasalts.\nRogers et al. (2000) used Nd and He isotopic evidence to\nsuggest that any Kenyan plume component is distinct from the\nAfar plume further N, inferring that at least two sub-\nlithospheric upper mantle source regions contribute to the\nma\u00aec rocks of the EARS within a length scale of 2000km.\n7. Polybaric fractionation\nWhilst locally common, e.g. in the Huri Hills (Class et al. 1994)\nand Chyulu Hills (Spa\u00c8 th et al. 2000, 2001), rocks representing\npossible primary magmas (mg-number >65) are normally\nrelatively scarce in the Kenya rift (Macdonald 1994; Macdo-\nnald et al. 2001). The overwhelming majority of basalts have\ncompositions consistent with substantial polybaric fractiona-\ntion of olivine-dominated assemblages from primary magmas.\nKarson & Curtis (1989) pointed out the requirement that the\nemplacement of huge volumes of magma in the rift has been\naccompanied by the formation of at least three to four times as\nmuch ma\u00aec and ultrama\u00aec cumulates. The fact that the\ngreatest volumes of basalts in the rift straddle the critical plane\nof silica-saturation (which becomes operative at \u00b924km\ndepth) indicates that a considerable proportion of the\ncumulates must have formed at, or close to, the crust\u00b1mantle\nboundary, maintaining crustal thickness by underplating.\nThe further fractionation histories of the ma\u00aec magmas\nprobably depended on local tectonics. Some magma batches\nretained around the crust\u00b1mantle boundary may have evolved\nby extended fractionation involving separation of olivine \u00a7\nclinopyroxene\u00a7 plagioclase, through hawaiitic to benmoreitic\ncompositions before their densities were lowered suf\u00aeciently\nfor them to ascend higher into the crust. Other basaltic magma\nbatches ascended high into the crust; for example, gravity\nhighs under the trachytic caldera volcanoes Suswa and\nMenegai (Fig. 4) have been interpreted by Swain (1992) as\nma\u00aec intrusions.\nPetrogenetic modelling has revealed that the compositional\nvariations in many basalt\u00b1trachyte suites are consistent with\nfractional crystallisation of basaltic parental magmas. Gen-\nerally, the degree of silica-saturation of the basaltic parents is\nre\u00afected in that of the daughter magmas; mildly alkaline\nbasalts are associated with trachytes which are mildly nephe-\nline- or quartz-normative; nephelinitic and basanitic magmas\ngenerated phonolitic residua (Sceal & Weaver 1971; Baker\net al. 1977; Weaver 1977; Brotzu et al. 1983; Price et al. 1985;\nBaker 1987; Macdonald et al. 1995; Kabeto et al. 2001a,b).\nIsotopic data, where available, indicate that fractional crystal-\nlisation was commonly accompanied by usually minor\nassimilation of crustal rocks (Norry et al. 1980; Davies &\nMacdonald 1987; Macdonald et al. 1995; Kabeto et al.\n2001a,b).\nDolerite blocks, containing residual glasses varying from\nmugearitic to peralkaline phonolitic compositions and thought\nto have been disrupted from a high-level, sill-like intrusion\nunder the Silali basalt\u00b1trachyte caldera volcano (see Fig. 4),\nprovide an analogue of the low-pressure fractionation of alkali\nolivine basaltic magma (Macdonald et al. 1995). Low-pressure\nMAGMATISM OF THE KENYA RIFT VALLEY: A REVIEW 247\nfractionation of hy-normative basalts at Silali is believed to\nhave generated quartz trachytes.\nIn some Quaternary volcanoes, extreme fractionation of\ntrachytic magma has generated compositionally zoned ash\n\u00afow tuffs, e.g. Menengai (Leat et al. 1984; Macdonald et al.\n1994a), Longonot (Clarke et al. 1990) and Suswa (Macdonald\net al. 1993). At a late stage of the fractionation of the Suswa\nmagma, a carbonatitic melt separated immiscibly, reinforcing\nviews that CO2 has played an important role in the\npetrogenesis of the salic rocks of the Kenya rift (Bailey 1978,\n1980, 1987; Scott 1982).\nGeophysical data (Swain 1992) are consistent with the view\nthat each of the central volcanoes of the rift axis (Fig. 4)\nrepresents a nexus, where the regional dyke swarm has fed\nhigh-level reservoirs. There is the potential, in such systems,\nfor magma to \u00afow into the reservoirs vertically and laterally.\nThus, major vent alignments at the Longonot and Suswa\ncaldera volcanoes (Fig. 4) are parallel to regional fault trends,\nwhilst the volume of material consumed during caldera\nformation at each centre is markedly greater than magma\nvolumes erupted during syn-caldera activity (Scott & Skilling\n1999). An episode of regional extension in the southern rift\nFigure 9 Approximate distribution of the Miocene Flood (Plateau) Phonolites (from Smith 1994, \u00aeg. 2). Also\nshown (stippled \u00aeelds) are outcrops of the Samburu Basalts (20\u00b111Ma) and contemporaneous basalt formations,\nand known and inferred eruptive centres of phonolites and basalts. The loci of eruptive centres broadly coincide\nwith the axis of the Kenya Dome.\nRAY MACDONALD248\nmay have triggered synchronous lateral magma withdrawal\nalong regional fractures, decompression of the magma\nchambers and caldera collapse. A small amount of mixing of\nSuswa trachyte magma with peralkaline rhyolite magma of the\nOlkaria centre (Fig. 4) was facilitated by the lateral propaga-\ntion of comendite magma southwards along a N\u00b1S tension\nfracture which links the two centres (Scott & Skilling 1999).\nFurther N, at the Emuruangogolak caldera volcano (Fig. 4),\nBlack et al. (1998) used trace element and isotopic evidence to\nshow that young (<38ka) basalts, comenditic trachytes and\npantelleritic trachytes represent several magmatic lineages,\nsometimes erupted as part of the same stratigraphic group.\nThey suggested that the Emuruangogolak plumbing system is\nremarkably open and is fed by multiple dyke injection close to\nthe surface.\nA petrological highlight of the Kenya rift is undoubtedly the\nactive carbonatite volcano Oldoinyo Lengai, Tanzania. Whilst\nperhaps best known for the eruption of natrocarbonatite lavas\nand pyroclastics, the volcano is dominated by silicate lavas.\nDawson (1998) has used young (<2000 years) nephelinites\nassociated with the natrocarbonatite to examine the petroge-\nnetic relationships between the silicate and carbonate phases.\nThere are two types of nephelinites: combeite nephelinites and\nwollastonite nephelinites, the natrocarbonatite being assoc-\niated with the latter. Dawson (1998) proposed that the genetic\nlink is fractionation of a parental carbonated olivine nephe-\nlinite magma under conditions of carbonate saturation,\npermitting unmixing of carbonate.\n8. Partial melting of deep crust\nA notable feature of themagmatismof theKenya rift is the huge\nvolumes of salic rocks which have been generated at various\ntimes. For example, the eruption of the sequences comprising\nthe Plateau Phonolites represents the largest phase of extrusive\nvolcanism in the rift (Fig. 9). Eruptions continued from 16 to 8\nMa, with the major part erupted between 13 and 11Ma. The\nvolume of the Plateau Phonolites has been estimated to be\nbetween 25,000 and 50;000km3 (Williams 1972; Lippard 1973).\nIn late Pliocene times, volcanism of the central sector of the rift\nvalleywas dominatedby the emplacementof thick (up to 300m)\nwelded and non-welded tuffs and ashfall deposits, of trachytic\nand phonolitic composition (Fig. 10). Total aggregate volumes\nare of the order of 6000\u00b17000 km3; possibly as high as\n10;000km3 (Smith 1994).\nBailey (1964, 1974) considered that these volumes were too\ngreat to have formed by fractional crystallisation of basaltic\nmagma, and proposed instead that they were the products of\npartial melting of crystalline parent materials, such as alkali\nbasalt, in the lower crust, the main mechanisms being relief of\npressure attendant upon upwarping of the lithosphere and\nFigure 10 Outcrop pattern and approximate limit of Pliocene trachyte\/phonolite tuffs (modi\u00aeed from Smith\n1994, \u00aeg. 3).

The relevant\ncrustal layer may be the high-velocity seismic layer (6\u00a28\u00b17\u00a21\nkm s\u00a11) identi\u00aeed at 25\u00b135 km depth, i.e. at the base of the\ncrust beneath the central rift, which has been interpreted as a\nmix of high-grade metamorphic rocks and underplating ma\u00aec\nand ultrama\u00aec material (Mooney & Christensen 1994; Hay et\nal. 1995a,b; Mechie et al. 1997).\nThe partial melting hypothesis was given signi\u00aecant support\nby the experimental studies of Hay & Wendlandt (1995), who\ndetermined the near-liquidus melting relations of a relatively\nma\u00aec, plateau-type phonolite from the Kenya rift. They found\nmultiple saturation of andesine, augite, phlogopite, apatite and\noxides at 0\u00a27GPa, 1000\u00afC, and XCO2 \u00bc 0\u00a242, with amphibole\nappearing at 975\u00afC. The assemblage and the compositionsof the\nphases were interpreted to indicate that plateau phonolite liquids\nwere derived by some 15% equilibriummelting of rocks of alkali\nbasalt composition in the lower crust (\u00b923km). Hay &\nWendlandt (1995) suggested that these liquids ascended fairly\nrapidly, degassing CO2, to high-level reservoirs, where low-pres-\nsure phenocrystassemblages formed.Hay et al. (1995a,b) showed\nthat geochemical, especially isotopic, data for plateau phonolites\nare consistent with mantle-derived parental compositions.\nThe ma\u00aec crustal rocks thought to be parental to the\nphonolites may have been added to the 6\u00a28 km s\u00a11 basal layer\nduring an extensive phase of alkali basaltic magmatism which\noccurred early in the evolution of the rift (23\u00b114 Ma; Hay et al.\n1995b). The addition of signi\u00aecant magma volumes may also\nhave played a role in the uplift of the Kenya Dome, around\nwhich the phonolites (and Pliocene tuffs) are centred (Figs 9,\n10; Smith 1994).\nKaszuba & Wendlandt (2000) examined the role of CO2 in\nKenyan magmatism via dehydration melting experiments on\nalkali basalt. Experiments were performed at 0\u00a27GPa and\n1GPa, 850\u00b11100 8C, 3\u00b15wt% H2O, and near the NNO buffer.\nVariable amounts of CO2 (molar CO2=\u00f0 H2O \u00fe CO2 \u00de \u00bc 0\u00a22\u00b1\n0\u00a29) were added to experiments at 1025\u00afC and 1050\u00afC:\nDehydration melting in the hydrous system produced silica-\noversaturated, peraluminous melts, whereas with CO2 present,\nnepheline-normative tephriphonolite, trachyandesite and tra-\nchyte melts were generated. Kaszuba & Wendlandt (2000) use\ntheir results to predict that many suites of continental alkaline\nrocks, such as those of the Kenya rift, are derived by low-\npressure dehydration melting of alkali basalt\u00b1carbon dioxide\ncrustal systems.\nFigure 11 Schematic illustration of the Cenozoic evolution of the Kenya rift, based on the interaction of an\nascending mantle plume with initially dry, (partially) depleted lithospheric mantle. This model, constructed by\nSpa\u00c8 th et al. (2001) for the Chyulu Hills Volcanic Province on the southeastern rift \u00afanks, is here considered to be\ngenerally applicable to the whole rift. No part of the Kenya rift has reached the `continental break-up\u2019 phase\nrepresented in stage d. Reproduced with permission of Oxford University Press.\nRAY MACDONALD250\n9. High-level partial melting of crust\nHigh-silica rhyolites are not common in the Kenya rift. The\nonly late Quaternary occurrences are at Olkaria and Eburru,\nwhich lie on the crest of the Kenya Dome near Lake Naivasha\n(Fig. 4). There are at least 80 small volcanic centres in the\nOlkaria \u00aeeld, overwhelmingly of mildly peralkaline (comendi-\ntic) composition. Basalt lavas occur peripherally to the \u00aeeld\nand as components of mixed magma rocks and it is likely that\nbasaltic magma underlies the whole \u00aeeld. The \u00aeeld shows\nunusually high heat \u00afow, temperatures as high as 2808C\nhaving been recorded at depths of 1350m (Noble & Ojiambo\n1975), suggesting that basalt magma has penetrated to high\nlevels.\nThere is strong geochemical evidence, particularly from Pb\nisotopes (Davies & Macdonald 1987) and U-series disequili-\nbria and Th isotopes (Black et al. 1997; Heumann & Davies\n2002), that the Olkaria rhyolites were formed by partial\nmelting of high-level crustal rocks. Experimental work by\nScaillet & Macdonald (2001) has outlined the likely pre-\neruptive conditions for the rhyolites; last equilibration was at\nan oxygen fugacity at, or possibly below, FMQ, temperatures\nbetween 740\u00afC and 660\u00afC and pressures \u00b5150MPa, equiva-\nlent to \u00b95 km depth. Melt evolution occurred under near H2O\nsaturation conditions, with pre-eruptivemelt water contents as\nhigh as 6wt%.\n10. General signi\u00aecance of the Cenozoic magmatism\nThe main features of the Cenozoic magmatic history of the\nKenya rift are now summarised, using as a basis the\nevolutionary cartoon of Spa\u00c8 th et al. (2001), which although\nenvisaged for generation of the Chyulu lavas, can be used as a\nmodel for magmatism over the whole Kenya rift (Fig. 11).\nIn Pre-Miocene times, one or more plumes, of uncertain\nsource, rose high into the asthenospherebeneath the SCLM, at\nleast parts of which had been chemically depleted and re-\nenriched during previous magmatic events (Fig. 11a). The\nSCLM was metasomatised by melts and\/or \u00afuids released\nfrom the ascending plume(s) (Fig. 11b). When the plume\nmaterial reached depths of \u00b5150km, dynamic uplift at the\nsurface initiated formation of the Kenya Dome.\nBy Miocene times, continued uprise of the plume raised\ngeothermal gradients and permitted dehydrationmelting of the\nmetasomatised lithospheric mantle. Partial melting occurred\nacross the garnet\u00b1spinel transition and degrees of melting were\nsmall, generally <3%. Primary magmas ranged in composi-\ntion from nephelinitic to hy-normative basaltic, more silica-\nundersaturated varieties being generated at greater depths\n(Fig. 11c). The primary magmas underwent variable polybaric\nfractionation histories, which included important contribu-\ntions to a high-velocity basal crustal layer. This layer may have\nacted, via volatile-\u00afuxed partial melting, as the source for\n\u00afood phonolites and trachytes. Trachytic and phonolitic\nmagmas were also formed by crystal fractionation of basaltic\nmagma in mid-crustal and high-level magma chambers.\nLocally, intrusion of basalt high into the crust resulted in\nvolatile-\u00afuxed partial melting of crustal protoliths to produce\nperalkaline, high-silica rhyolites.\nWith reference to continental \u00afood basalt provinces,\nGallagher & Hawkesworth (1992) and Turner et al. (1996)\nhave argued that early melt generation within hydrated\nlithosphere (for a \u00b9100km-thick mechanical boundary layer)\nwithin the \u00aerst few million years of conductive heating by a\nplume will be followed by a greater asthenospheric contribu-\ntion, once the \u00ad -factor reaches a value >2. Calling on the\nTurner et al. (1996) model, Le Roex et al. (2001) suggest that at\nleast the southern part of the Kenya rift is analogous to the\nearly stages of a major \u00afood basalt province, with melting\ntaking place entirely within the lithosphere and the amounts of\nextension being low. One implication of the plume model\nmight be that, at some future stage, Kenyan magmatism will\nshow an increasing plume signature, and the plume will\neventually lead to continental break-up (Fig. 11d). Whether a\nplume alone can drive continental break-up, or would require\nthe cooperation of favourable far-\u00aeeld tectonic stresses, is for\nthe moment far from clear.\n11.
