It produces high-quality research information on the costs,\neffectiveness and broader impact of health technologies for those who use, manage and provide care in\nthe NHS. \u2018Health technologies\u2019 are broadly defined to include all interventions used to promote health,\nprevent and treat disease, and improve rehabilitation and long-term care, rather than settings of care.\nThe research findings from the HTA Programme directly influence decision-making bodies such as the\nNational Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the National Screening Committee\n(NSC). HTA findings also help to improve the quality of clinical practice in the NHS indirectly in that\nthey form a key component of the \u2018National Knowledge Service\u2019.\nThe HTA Programme is needs-led in that it fills gaps in the evidence needed by the NHS. There are\nthree routes to the start of projects. \nFirst is the commissioned route. Suggestions for research are actively sought from people working in the\nNHS, the public and consumer groups and professional bodies such as royal colleges and NHS trusts.\nThese suggestions are carefully prioritised by panels of independent experts (including NHS service\nusers). The HTA Programme then commissions the research by competitive tender. \nSecondly, the HTA Programme provides grants for clinical trials for researchers who identify research\nquestions. These are assessed for importance to patients and the NHS, and scientific rigour.\nThirdly, through its Technology Assessment Report (TAR) call-off contract, the HTA Programme\ncommissions bespoke reports, principally for NICE, but also for other policy-makers. TARs bring \ntogether evidence on the value of specific technologies.\nSome HTA research projects, including TARs, may take only months, others need several years. They can\ncost from as little as \u00a340,000 to over \u00a31 million, and may involve synthesising existing evidence,\nundertaking a trial, or other research collecting new data to answer a research problem.\nThe final reports from HTA projects are peer-reviewed by a number of independent expert referees\nbefore publication in the widely read monograph series Health Technology Assessment. \nCriteria for inclusion in the HTA monograph series\nReports are published in the HTA monograph series if (1) they have resulted from work for the HTA\nProgramme, and (2) they are of a sufficiently high scientific quality as assessed by the referees and editors.\nReviews in Health Technology Assessment are termed \u2018systematic\u2019 when the account of the search,\nappraisal and synthesis methods (to minimise biases and random errors) would, in theory, permit the\nreplication of the review by others.\nThe research reported in this monograph was commissioned by the HTA Programme as project number\n04\/08\/02. The contractual start date was in February 2005. The draft report began editorial review in\nJune 2006 and was accepted for publication in April 2007. As the funder, by devising a commissioning\nbrief, the HTA Programme specified the research question and study design. The authors have been\nwholly responsible for all data collection, analysis and interpretation, and for writing up their work.

GObjectives: To assess whether open angle glaucoma\n(OAG) screening meets the UK National Screening\nCommittee criteria, to compare screening strategies\nwith case finding, to estimate test parameters, to\nmodel estimates of cost and cost-effectiveness, and to\nidentify areas for future research.\nData sources: Major electronic databases were\nsearched up to December 2005.\nReview methods: Screening strategies were\ndeveloped by wide consultation. Markov submodels\nwere developed to represent screening strategies.\nParameter estimates were determined by systematic\nreviews of epidemiology, economic evaluations of\nscreening, and effectiveness (test accuracy, screening\nand treatment).

No test was\nclearly most accurate, with only a few, heterogeneous\nstudies for each test. No randomised controlled trials\n(RCTs) of screening were identified.

Open angle glaucoma (OAG)\naccounts for about 50% of glaucoma blindness.\nPrior evaluations of screening effectiveness have\nconcluded that there is insufficient evidence to\nrecommend screening for OAG; recent treatments\nappear effective in delaying progression, but long-\nterm health outcomes are uncertain. Screening\nprogrammes for OAG have not been adopted in\nany country. In the UK, glaucoma is detected by\nopportunistic case finding, usually by community\noptometrists. \nObjectives\nThe objectives of this systematic review were:\n\u25cf to assess whether OAG screening meets the UK\nNational Screening Committee (NSC) criteria\n\u25cf to develop a model comparing screening\nstrategies with case finding\n\u25cf to estimate parameters through systematic\nreviews\n\u25cf to model estimates of cost and cost-effectiveness\n\u25cf to identify areas for future research.\nMethods\nScreening strategies were developed by wide\nconsultation. In the first (\u2018technician\u2019) strategy, the\ncohort \u2018at risk\u2019 would be invited for examination,\nbased on measurement of intraocular pressure\n(IOP) and a second \u2018test\u2019 (not prespecified). Screen\npositives would be referred for specialised\noptometrist assessment. In the second (\u2018glaucoma\noptometrist\u2019) strategy, the cohort would be invited\nto a specialised optometrist for assessment.\nPositives from either strategy would be referred for\ndiagnosis, by an ophthalmologist, as occurs in\ncurrent case finding (\u2018no screening\u2019 strategy). \nMarkov submodels were developed to represent\nthese strategies. Parameter estimates were\ndetermined by systematic reviews of epidemiology,\neconomic evaluations of screening, and effectiveness\n(test accuracy, screening and treatment). \nTailored highly sensitive electronic searches were\nundertaken. The date of last searches was \nDecember 2005.\nResults\nIn the UK, the estimated prevalence of OAG is\n2.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7 to 2.5],\nranging from 0.3% in people aged 40 to 3.3% in\npeople aged 70 years. Incidence ranges from 30 to\n181 per 100,000 person-years for ages 50 and 70\nyears, respectively. Of an estimated half a million\npeople affected, 67% are undetected. Several risk\nfactors are identified; for ages 40\u201375 years,\nprevalence estimates are: people with myopia 2.7%,\npeople with diabetes 3.3% and family history in a\nfirst-degree relative 6.7%. The risk is four times\nhigher among those of African ethnicity. Insufficient\ndata were available to estimate prevalence in other\nethnic minority groups in the UK.\nMost potential screening tests reviewed had an\nestimated specificity of 85% or higher. No test\nwas clearly most accurate, with only a few,\nheterogeneous studies for each test.\nNo randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of\nscreening were identified. Based on two treatment\nRCTs, early treatment reduces the risk of\nprogression (hazard ratio 0.65, 95% CI 0.49 to\n0.87). Extrapolating from this, and assuming\naccelerated progression with advancing disease\nseverity, without treatment the mean time to\nblindness in at least one eye was approximately\n23 years, compared to 35 years with treatment. \nThe main determinant of cost-effectiveness was\nprevalence. Prevalence would have to be about\n3\u20134% in 40 year olds with a screening interval of\n10 years to approach cost-effectiveness. It is\npredicted that screening might be cost-effective in\na 50-year-old cohort at a prevalence of 4% with a\n10-year screening interval. General population\nscreening at any age, thus, appears not to be cost-\neffective. Selective screening of groups with higher\nprevalence (black ethnicity and family history)\nmight be worthwhile, although this would only\ncover 6% of the population. Extension to include\nother at-risk cohorts (e.g. myopia and diabetes)\nExecutive summarywould include 37% of the general population, but\nthe prevalence is then too low for screening to be\nconsidered cost-effective. \nScreening using a test with initial automated\nclassification followed by assessment by a\nspecialised optometrist, for test positives, was\nmore cost-effective than initial specialised\noptometric assessment. The cost-effectiveness of\nthe screening programme was highly sensitive to\nthe perspective on costs (NHS or societal). In the\nbase-case model, the NHS costs of visual\nimpairment were estimated as \u00a3669. If annual\nsocietal costs were \u00a38800, then screening might be\nconsidered cost-effective for a 40-year-old cohort\nwith 1% OAG prevalence assuming a willingness to\npay of \u00a330,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Of\nlesser importance were changes to estimates of\nattendance for sight tests, incidence of OAG, rate\nof progression and utility values for each stage of\nOAG severity. Cost-effectiveness was not\nparticularly sensitive to the accuracy of screening\ntests within the ranges observed. However, a\nhighly specific test is required to reduce large\nnumbers of false-positive referrals. \nThe findings that population screening is unlikely\nto be cost-effective are based on an economic\nmodel whose parameter estimates have\nconsiderable uncertainty. In particular, if rate of\nprogression and\/or costs of visual impairment are\nhigher than estimated then screening could be\ncost-effective. \nConclusions\nImplications for healthcare\nScreening for OAG met the UK NSC criteria for\ncondition and treatment, but not for test or\nscreening. Population screening is not cost-\neffective, but targeted screening of high-risk\ngroups may be. Measures systematically to \nidentify those at risk and quality assure the\nprogramme would be required. Adequate service\nprovision for those screened positive would be\nneeded. \nGlaucoma detection can be improved by\nincreasing attendance for eye examination, and\nimproving the performance of current testing by\neither refining practice or adding in a technology-\nbased first assessment, the latter being the more\ncost-effective option. This has implications for any\nfuture organisational changes in community eye-\ncare services.\nImplications for research \nFurther research should aim to develop and\nprovide quality data to populate the economic\nmodel, by undertaking the following, in order of\npriority.\nFirst, a feasibility study of interventions to improve\ndetection; input from qualitative researchers,\nhealth economists, health psychologists and\ntrialists is required to evaluate components of the\ncare pathway:\n\u25cf optimal test strategy\n\u25cf acceptability of interventions to improve\nattendance and the acceptability of subsequent\ntesting\n\u25cf harms and benefits associated with enhanced\nglaucoma detection strategies.\nSecondly, a refinement of the parameter estimates\nin the economic model. In particular, further data\non costs of blindness, risk of progression and\nhealth outcomes are required. A value for\ninformation analysis would inform where primary\nresearch should be directed.\nThirdly, an RCT of interventions to improve the\nuptake of glaucoma testing, informed by the\nresults of the prior feasibility studies.\nx\nExecutive summaryT\nhis report was commissioned to evaluate the\nclinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of\nscreening for open angle glaucoma (OAG) in the\nUK. Specifically, secondary research with economic\nmodelling was required to assess the extent to\nwhich screening for OAG would meet the National\nScreening Committee (NSC) criteria for a\nscreening programme and to identify future\nresearch needs.\nThe specific objectives were:\n\u25cf to review systematically risk factors for\ndeveloping OAG, and to determine the\nprevalence and incidence of OAG according to\nage\n\u25cf to review systematically the accuracy of\nscreening tests for OAG\n\u25cf to review systematically treatment effectiveness\nand to extrapolate these effects on long-term\nvisual outcome\n\u25cf to identify any potential benefits and harms of\nscreening and subsequent management\n\u25cf to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness\nof alternative screening strategies\n\u25cf to assess whether screening for OAG meets\nspecified criteria for a national screening\nprogramme\n\u25cf to describe the impact on the NHS if a\npopulation screening programme for OAG were\ninitiated\n\u25cf to identify and prioritise areas for future\nresearch.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n1\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

The primary glaucomas (those that are\nnot a consequence of other eye or systemic\ndisease) can be classified as OAG or angle closure\nglaucoma. These two types are distinguished by\nthe anatomy of the anterior segment of the eye, as\nillustrated in Figure 1.\nAngle closure glaucoma, although less common\nthan OAG, is more likely to result in bilateral\nblindness and is estimated to be the cause of 50%\nof glaucoma blindness worldwide.1,2 While\nscreening for angle closure glaucoma may be\nappropriate for other country settings, it is a\ndifferent disease from OAG, with different risk\nfactors, and different screening tests are required\nfor early detection. The epidemiology of OAG is\ndescribed in detail in Chapter 5.\nThis report was commissioned to assess whether\nscreening for OAG would be worthwhile in the\nUK. Screening for OAG among \u2018at-risk\u2019 target\npopulations with interval screening offered at\nselected sites has not been adopted in any country,\nbut a number of ad hoc strategies exists, with\nclinical guidelines for the detection and\nsubsequent management of glaucoma.3\u20137\nFor screening for OAG to be considered, several\ncriteria should be addressed. In the UK, the NSC\nprovides advice to government on which\npopulation screening programmes should be\nintroduced. The NSC uses a set of criteria, based\non the original WHO criteria,8 but developed over\nthe years to take account of new scientific\ndevelopments. These criteria are available on the\nNSC website.9 Not all the criteria are relevant to\nOAG, but most are. In brief, the condition should\nbe an important public health problem, there\nneeds to be an acceptable test or combination of\ntests that are able to detect sufficient people at risk\nof visual impairment to justify testing large\nnumbers of people who are not at risk, early\ntreatment must be effective and acceptable, and\nappropriate diagnostic and management facilities\nto care for people with detected glaucoma must be\navailable. The benefits of screening must outweigh\nthe risks, and the programme needs to be cost-\neffective and practically feasible. The NSC, in\ncooperation with the Welsh Assembly, convened a\nworkshop on screening for glaucoma in\nSeptember 2001 and a report has been issued.10\nThe current NSC policy is that screening for OAG\nis not yet recommended, and the topic is due for\nreconsideration in 2008.11\nA recent health technology assessment report for\nthe US Preventative Services Task Force found that\nscreening can detect early OAG in adults and that\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n3\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

Raised\nintraocular pressure (IOP) of at least 21 mmHg\n(two standard deviations above the mean) used to\nbe considered as a part of the definition of OAG,\nbut population studies have consistently found\nthat many people with OAG have an IOP below\nthis level.20\u201324 The risk of developing glaucoma,\nand for worsening of existing glaucoma, does,\nhowever, increase with increasing IOP.25\u201327 More\nadvanced disease at diagnosis is also associated\nwith a higher IOP.23,28\nTypical early glaucomatous changes in the optic\ndisc include localised or generalised thinning of\nthe neuroretinal rim, with increased enlargement\nof the optic cup and an increased cup-to-disc ratio\n(CDR). As glaucoma advances, there is further\nneuroretinal rim thinning until the cup occupies\nmost of the disc area (Figure 2).\nCurrently, the only treatment for OAG is to lower\nthe IOP. This can be done medically, usually with\neye drops, or surgically, by laser, or any\ncombination of these. The effectiveness of OAG\ntreatments is evaluated in a number of ongoing or\ncompleted Cochrane reviews,18,29\u201331 and is\ndiscussed in Chapter 7.\nBurden of disease in the UK\nGlaucoma is second to age-related macular\ndegeneration as the most common cause of\nblindness in adults in the UK and Ireland.32\u201335\nThe statutory definition of blindness is that \u201ca\nperson should be so blind as to be unable to\nperform any employment\u201d. There is no equivalent\ndefinition for partial sight, but it refers to people\nwho are not blind, but who are substantially and\npermanently disabled by defective vision.36\nOphthalmologists register new cases of blindness\nand partial sight with the local authorities across\nthe UK. Registration is voluntary; it is a\nprerequisite for receiving certain social security\nbenefits, but not for all social service concessions.\nThe recommendations for blind and partial sight\nregistration, based on the vision of the better eye,\nare as described in Box 1.\nThe frequency of glaucoma as a cause of blindness\nor partial sight is reported as incidence (new\ncases) and prevalence (all cases). Registration data\nare available for England, Scotland and Wales,37\u201339\nbut recent estimates of incident visual impairment\nare not available for Northern Ireland. In\nEngland, Scotland and Wales, 31,676 people were\nBackground\n4\nCup\nNeuroretinal rim\nDisc\nDisc\n(a) (b)\nFIGURE 2 The optic nerve in OAG: (a) healthy optic nerve (reproduced with permission from AgingEye Times, www.agingeye.net); \n(b) advanced glaucoma damage (reproduced courtesy of A Azuara-Blanco)registered as incident visual impairment (blind\nand partial sight registrations) in 2002\/03,\nalthough data were not detailed according to\ncauses of visual impairment. \nA detailed analysis of main causes of blindness for\nEngland and Wales in 1990\/91 found that\nglaucoma was the main cause in 11.7% of incident\nblind registrations and 9.6% of partial sight\nregistrations for all ages, and a contributing cause\nin another 8% of blind and 4% of partial sight\nregistrations.34 People may be registered using the\nspecific term OAG or simply as \u2018glaucoma,\nunspecified\u2019. A more recent analysis of certifications\nof visual impairment in England and Wales in\n1999\/2000 found similar proportions, with\nglaucoma accounting for 10.9% of blindness and\n10.2% of partial sight registrations, although the\nanalysis was not detailed according to registrations\nspecifically for OAG.32 Applying these proportions\nto registration data for 2002\/03, it can be estimated\nthat 3108\u20133138 people aged over 50 years were\nnewly registered with visual impairment (blind and\npartial sight) due to glaucoma in England and\nScotland in 2002\/03. There are at least 1192 new\nregistrations of incident visual impairment due to\nOAG as the main cause, but the true number may\nbe higher than this, as some OAG cases would\nhave been registered as glaucoma non-specified.\nData for Wales were not detailed according to age\nand are not included.\nData on blind and partial sight registration may\nnot be accurate for several reasons. The criteria\nfor registration are subjective, some eligible\npeople do not wish to be registered and\nophthalmologists may not offer registration to\nthose who are eligible. Analyses of people eligible\nfor blind and partial sight registration from\nattendees at ophthalmology departments in three\ncentres in the UK have estimated that up to 50%\nof individuals eligible for blind or partial sight\nregistration are not registered.32,40,41 These studies\nwere consistent in their findings that people\neligible for partial sight registration were less likely\nto be registered than people eligible for blind\nregistration. People with visual field loss alone\nwere less likely to be registered than people with\nimpaired central visual acuity, and people\nundergoing long-term treatment and follow-up\nwere less likely to be registered or have\nregistration delayed compared with people with a\ncondition that was untreatable and not under\nlong-term follow-up, for example age-related\nmacular degeneration.32,40,41 It is therefore likely\nthat many more people have visual impairment\ndue to OAG than currently recorded in the UK\nblind and partial sight registration system. \nVision below the level that is required for driving\nis a major burden of glaucoma, and is not\nnecessarily reflected in the visual impairment\nstatistics, but is of importance to those affected.\nThe number of people who have been forced to\nsurrender a driving licence on account of\nglaucoma visual field loss is not captured by\nnational statistics, but would be an important\nindicator of the burden of glaucoma.\nCurrent practice for glaucoma\ndetection in the UK\nIn the UK, community optometrists are the key\nproviders of primary eye care; general medical\npractitioners do not usually have access to\nspecialist equipment or the necessary training and\nskills to detect glaucoma. The majority (90%) of\nreferrals to secondary care ophthalmology as\nsuspect glaucoma are initiated from an\noptometrist.42\u201344 Current detection strategies are\nopportunistic, based on optometrist case finding\nor open access where the population tested is self-\nselecting. In the UK, apart from Scotland, only\nselect groups qualify for a free sight test; such\ngroups are people aged over 40 years with a\nfamily history of glaucoma, people aged over\n60 years and those on income support. Guidelines\nexist for a more detailed eye examination in \nat-risk groups; the optometrist is advised to\nundertake an assessment of the optic nerve head,\nperform tonometry and undertake a central visual\nfield assessment.45 \u2018At risk\u2019 is not, however, defined\nand is at the discretion of the practitioner: a sight\ntest may not necessarily include testing for\nglaucoma, and, as such, cases, particularly early\nglaucoma, are missed.\nIn summary, the current service does not\nconstitute a formal attempt to reach and test\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n5\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

The thrust of the new service\nis to move away from the current emphasis of a\nsight test on refraction to a broader eye health\nassessment appropriate to the patient\u2019s needs,\nincluding a more extensive examination to\nimprove glaucoma detection. \nDiagnostic and treatment services\nCurrent, usual practice is that suspect glaucoma\ncases identified by community optometrists are\nreferred to secondary care for an\nophthalmologist\u2019s opinion with treatment,\nobservation or discharge as required. People\nrequiring treatment or observation as high-risk\nsuspects remain under review by an\nophthalmologist. \nWith an ageing population and improved\ndetection, the current diagnostic and management\nservice in secondary hospital care is likely to\nbecome increasingly overloaded. Several schemes\nare in operation in the UK, which aim to alleviate\nthe pressure on the hospital eye service and\nimprove glaucoma care, by using glaucoma-\ntrained optometrists, or nurse practitioners in \nco-managed shared care treatment and\nmonitoring schemes, which may be hospital or\ncommunity based.48\u201350 National initiatives to\ndefine and develop clinical care pathways for\nglaucoma are underway.51\u201354 These, together with\na review of general ophthalmic services55 and a\nconnected information technology system in the\nNHS, provide the basis for a standardised\ndiagnostic and treatment service for glaucoma.\nBackground\n6Description of potential screening\ntests\nIdeally, a screening test for OAG should be safe,\neasy to administer and interpret, portable, quick,\nacceptable to the people who are to be tested, and\nsufficiently valid to distinguish between those who\ndo and do not have OAG.\nTests for glaucoma involve an assessment of\nstructural changes at the optic nerve head,\nfunctional visual loss by visual field testing and the\nlevel of the IOP. It is not always possible to make a\ndefinitive diagnosis using these criteria. A person\ncould have a media opacity precluding a view of\nthe optic disc, or visual field testing may not be\npossible, and in these circumstances diagnosis is\nmade on only one of these findings or severe\nvisual loss with raised IOP.56\nMany commercial devices, particularly for\nassessing structural damage, are now available.\nThe following sections describe candidate\nscreening tests for OAG. The diagnostic\nperformance of the candidate screening tests is\nreported in Chapter 6.\nIntraocular pressure\nMeasurement: contact and non-contact\ntonometry\nContact tonometry and non-contact tonometry\n(NCT) are quick, taking about 1\u20132 minutes per\neye.\nContact tonometry\nThe most widely used and generally accepted\nreference standard for measuring the IOP is\nGoldmann applanation tonometry (GAT). GAT\nuses a prism to apply an external force to the\ncornea to indent and flatten its surface.57 The two\ngeneral sources of error with Goldmann\ntonometry can be categorised as those caused by\nfaults in the application of the technique and\nthose related to biological variability of the human\neye, both normal and pathological. Of particular\nnote is the error induced by variability in the\ncentral corneal thickness. GAT is mounted onto a\nslit-lamp, which limits its convenience, and is\nusually performed by trained optometrists, nurses\nand ophthalmologists. A clinical background is not\nessential; with training a technician can perform\nGAT. \nThe Perkins tonometer is a portable device that is\nsimilar to the Goldmann tonometer. Like the\nother portable devices, it is useful in situations\nwhere a patient cannot be seated at a slit-lamp,\nsuch as bedside examinations, the operating \nroom, nursing homes, remote areas and mass\nscreenings.\nThe Tonopen is an automated handheld\napplanation tonometer based on the\nMacKay\u2013Marg tonometer.58 It is small, light and\nbattery operated, but may be less accurate than\nGAT. \nThere are potential problems with using contact\ntonometry in a screening situation in that contact\nwith the tear film and the cornea may raise\nconcerns regarding transmissible disease.\nChemical disinfection is required after each test to\nreduce the risk of cross-infection.\nDisposable prisms for Goldmann and Perkins\ntonometry or disposable covers for the Tonopen\ntip avoid the risk of cross-infection but incur\nadditional costs. Disposable prism tonometry is,\npotentially, a reliable alternative to GAT.59\nNon-contact tonometry\nNCTs applanate the cornea with a puff of air.60\nMeasurement errors are larger in patients who\nsqueeze their eyelids or who blink rapidly in\nresponse to the startling jet of air, and in eyes with\nmoderately elevated IOPs. The advantages of\nNCT include speed, no anaesthetic and low risk\nfor corneal abrasion (hence more suitable for\ntechnician operation) and, since there is no direct\ncontact with the eye, any infection control issues\nare avoided. \nPopulation distribution of IOP\nIOP in the population is normally distributed \nwith an additional tail towards higher levels of\nIOP (Figure 3). The mean IOP in adult\npopulations is consistently estimated at\n15\u201316 mmHg, with a standard deviation (SD) of\n2.5\u20132.8 mmHg.20\u201322,61\u201366 Other factors (ethnicity,\ndiabetes, systolic blood pressure, family history of\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n7\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

In people with glaucoma the median\nuntreated IOP has been estimated to be\n26 mmHg.62,68\nStructural damage\nStructural damage is assessed clinically by a\nsubjective assessment of the optic nerve head (the\noptic disc) and\/or by evaluating the retinal nerve\nfibre layer.\nOphthalmoscopy (direct and indirect)\nDirect ophthalmoscopy (i.e. with a direct\nophthalmoscope), best performed with the pupils\ndilated and the room darkened, provides a\nmagnified view of the optic disc. The main\ndisadvantage is the absence of a stereoscopic view.\nThe examiner has to use indirect cues to allow the\ninterpretation of the optic disc as a tridimensional\nstructure. Furthermore, direct ophthalmoscopy\ndoes not yield a permanent record, and the\nexaminer is required to draw the optic disc to\nallow subsequent comparisons. \nBinocular ophthalmoscopy has the advantage of\nstereopsis, allowing a tridimensional observation\nof the optic disc. Current practice consists of the\nuse of a standard slit-lamp biomicroscopy\nassociated with non-contact lenses (60D or 78D).\nThe possibility of achieving stereopsis depends on\nthe pupil\u2019s size, which often needs to be dilated,\nthe image is inverted and additional training is\nrequired for accurate interpretation. It is also\npossible to use the slit-lamp in association with a\ncontact lens (e.g. the Goldmann lens), but this\ntechnique requires the use of a topical anaesthetic\nand a viscoelastic substance between the lens and\nthe cornea. Despite being more uncomfortable,\nthe image provided is excellent with high\nmagnification and is not inverted, making for\neasier interpretation. \nOptic disc photography (monoscopic and\nstereoscopic)\nA wide variety of digital and non-digital cameras is\navailable to provide colour images of the optic\ndisc. Photography has the advantage over\nophthalmoscopy of a permanent recording of the\noptic disc, but has the same limitations of ideally\nrequiring a dilated pupil and clear media, that is,\nno significant cataract. Monoscopic photographs\ncan be obtained with a standard fundus camera;\nhowever, the tridimensional structure of the optic\ndisc can only be assessed by stereophotography.\nStereoscopic pictures can be obtained with\nsequential photographs using a standard fundus\ncamera by horizontal realignment of the camera\nbase when photographing the same retinal image.\nAlternatively, simultaneous stereoscopic fundus\nphotographs can be obtained using a camera with\na beam-splitting prism to capture two images of\nthe fundus taken simultaneously at a fixed relative\nangle. Digital stereophotographs may be viewed in\na number of ways, using either stereoviewers or\nflicker glasses, which rapidly alternate the image\nbetween the left and right eye of the observer.69\nScreening tests for glaucoma\n8\n10 20 30 40\nMean\n(16)\n+2 SD\n(21)\nP\nN\nG\nIOP (mmHg)\nF\nr\ne\nq\nu\ne\nn\nc\ny\nFIGURE 3 Intraocular pressure (IOP). G, glaucoma population; N, normal distribution; P , frequency of distribution of IOP in population.Population distribution of CDR\nOptic disc changes typical of glaucoma include\nvertical and generalised thinning of the\nneuroretinal rim, localised thinning and notching,\nand displacement of the retinal vessels. A\nconsensus definition for glaucomatous optic\nneuropathy has been proposed whereby a CDR\nabove which 2.5% of the normal population lie\ndefines the upper limit of normal.56 Optic disc\nparameters, particularly size of the optic disc, vary\nfor different populations; in European\npopulations, the 97.5% centile typically equates to\na vertical cup-to-disc ratio (VCDR) of 0.770 and is\ngenerally considered to be the most useful\nparameter for determining glaucoma in the\npresence of a visual field defect.56 Cup disc\nasymmetry of 0.2\u20130.3 could also be used to define\nglaucoma.71,72 For subjects in whom a reliable\nvisual field test is not possible, a cut-off exceeding\nthe 99.5th percentile (i.e. a VCDR   0.9), in most\npopulations, would define glaucoma. Cup disc size\nvaries between populations with small discs having\nsmall cups that may be pathological, and vice\nversa for large discs. Thus, the division between\nnormal and abnormal for optic disc parameters is\nnot clear, and therefore a screening test based on a\nsubjective assessment of glaucomatous optic nerve\ndamage would require an experienced observer to\ndiagnose glaucoma accurately.\nRetinal nerve fibre layer photography\nThe appearance of the retinal nerve fibre layer\n(RNFL) may be documented using high-resolution\nblack and white images, where the fibre bundles\nare seen as silver striations, most visible in the\nsuperior and inferior poles of the optic disc\n(Figure 4). The technique includes the use of a\ngreen or blue filter with either standard or digital\nphotography. The quality of RNFL image is poor\nin eyes with small pupils and media opacities.\nFurthermore, the technique is subjective and\nrequires an experienced observer for\ninterpretation. A manual with a reference set of\nRNFL images is available to guide technicians in\nthe reading of such images.73\nQuantitative analysis of the optic nerve head and\nRNFL\nScanning laser tomography\nConfocal laser scanning imaging technology, used\nby the Heidelberg retina tomograph (HRT;\nHeidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany),\nexploits the principle of confocal laser scanning to\nallow quantitative structural information.\nThe topographic image is derived from multiple\noptical sections at consecutive focal depth planes.\nEach image consists of numerous pixels, with each\npixel corresponding to the retinal height at its\nlocation. The device is operator dependent in that\nthe optic disc margin needs to be defined by a\ncontour line manually placed around the inner\nmargin of the peripapillary scleral ring. The\nsoftware calculates stereometric parameters within\nthis line. These parameters are computed for the\nwhole of the optic nerve head, and for six\npredefined sectors.\nThe HRT II is compact and relatively easy to use,\npupil dilation is not required and cataracts do not\nprevent imaging. Specific training is required in\ncontour line placement, which can be a source of\nerror in image analysis. Measurement time is\nabout 10 minutes per eye.13,14 HRT III is now\navailable and does not require manual drawing of\nthe contour line.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n9\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.\nRNFL defect\ntypical of glaucoma\nFIGURE 4 The retinal nerve fibre layer (reproduced courtesy of A Azuara-Blanco)Population distribution of test parameters\nThe commercially available HRT II device reports\nthe Moorfields regression analysis (MRA) as a\nclassification system for glaucoma. This\nclassification is based on a normative database of\n80 normal white participants, with a refractive\nerror of less than 6 dioptres (D).74 The\nneuroretinal rim (NRR) is thinned in glaucoma,\nand the MRA has derived limits for normality\nbased on the area of the NRR, classified for each\nsegment of the optic disc. Three diagnostic classes\nare given: within normal limits (the NRR area lies\nwithin the 95% prediction interval of normal),\nborderline (between 95% and 99%) and outside\nnormal limits (beyond 99.9%). This is a statistical\nclassification, based on a narrowing of the NRR.\nThe classifications of borderline and outside\nnormal limits are considered as indicative of OAG,\nbut definitive diagnosis requires other relevant\nclinical data. \nHowever, the normative database is based on small\nnumbers and may not be valid for non-white\npopulations, people with high refractive error and\nlarge or tilted optic discs; as such, the results\nshould be interpreted with caution. The HRT III\nincorporates a new, larger, race-specific database.\nThis new normative database consists of 733 eyes\nof white people and 215 eyes of black people. The\nsoftware v3.0 calculates the glaucoma probability\nscore (GPS), a new, automated algorithm that\nevaluates both optic disc and parapapillary RNFL\ntopography to estimate the probability of\nglaucoma. The GPS uses a new sophisticated\nversion of artificial intelligence known as a\nrelevance vector machine (RVM) that estimates the\nlikelihood of glaucoma. No contour line or\nreference plane is used in the GPS calculation, and\ntherefore it is completely an operator-independent\nanalysis.\nData are limited on the distribution of HRT\nparameters in the general population and this is\nrelevant to the use of the HRT as a screening\ndevice for OAG. In the UK, a study evaluating\nscreening for eye disease75 is ongoing (the\nBridlington eye assessment project), where people\naged over 65 years receive a comprehensive eye\nexamination by a trained optometrist, with the\nexamination including optic disc imaging using\nthe HRT II. Women were found to have\nsignificantly larger rim volume, mean RNFL\nthickness and cross-sectional area than men, and\ntended to have smaller cup areas and volumes and\ncup-to-disc area ratios than men. It is also worth\nnoting that the performance of the HRT is\ndependent on the optic disc size.76,77 For HRT II\nto be used in a screening situation the diagnostic\ncriteria for classification as normal and abnormal\nneed to be appropriately defined. Asymmetrical\nthinning of the NRR is recognised as one of the\ndiagnostic criteria for OAG. In the same\nBridlington population study, a reference range\nfor rim to disc area asymmetry in a normal elderly\npopulation was defined, with this measure having\nthe advantage over other HRT parameters of\nbeing independent of age, gender and disc size. A\nmeasure of between-eye NRR asymmetry could be\nused to discriminate between normals and\nabnormals for screening purposes.78\nScanning laser polarimetry\nScanning laser polarimetry (SLP) measures the\nRNFL thickness objectively based on the\nbirefringent properties of the RNFL, which has its\nneurotubules disposed in an organised, parallel\nfashion. This peculiar anatomy leads to a rotation\nof the plane of polarised light as it passes through\nthe RNFL, creating a retardation that is directly\nproportional to its thickness. The current model\n(GDx VCC) introduces variable corneal\ncompensation to enhance the accuracy of the\nmeasurements. The GDx VCC is user friendly and\ncompact, and pupil dilation is not required. A\ntechnician can perform the test. The disadvantage\nis that eyes with optic disc abnormalities, such as\nlarge myopic discs with peripapillary atrophy,\ncannot be imaged reliably. The GDx VCC can\nacquire images in less than 3 minutes for both\neyes.\nPopulation distribution of test parameters\nThe normative database characterises the normal\ntridimensional RNFL thickness, and individual\npatient profiles are compared with the normative\ndatabase, thus indicating RNFL loss due to\ndisease. The database also includes data on\nglaucoma subjects and is the basis of the machine\nclassifier, the nerve fibre indicator (NFI), for\nindicating OAG damage. There is a wide range \nof RNFL thickness values among normal\nindividuals, with overlap between normal and eyes\nwith OAG. The GDx NFI is intended to supply the\nclinician with a method of glaucoma diagnosis,\nand the higher the NFI the greater the likelihood\nthat the eye has glaucoma. A score of 0\u201330 is\nconsidered normal, 31\u201370 indicates that the eye is\nsuspect for glaucoma and 71\u2013100 indicates that\nthe eye is glaucomatous. The GDx VCC normative\ndatabase contains 811 (540 normal, 271\nglaucoma) patients. Ethnic minorities are well\nrepresented on the database: Caucasians and\nHispanics 70%, African-Americans 18% and \nAsians 12%.79\nScreening tests for glaucoma\n10Optical coherence tomography\nThe RNFL thickness is also measured by optical\ncoherence tomography (OCT). OCT is an optical\nimaging technique capable of providing high-\nresolution, cross-sectional, in vivo imaging of the\nhuman retina in a fashion analogous to B-scan\nultrasonography, but using light instead of\nsound.80 The first commercial system was available\nin 1996; the latest generation OCT3 system is\nStratus-OCT. Early OCT systems required a pupil\nsize of at least 5 mm. OCT3, however, operates\nwith a 3-mm pupil size, which suggests, like non-\nmydriatic fundus cameras, that pupil dilation is\nnot required when operated in a darkened room.\nPosterior subcapsular cataracts and cortical\ncataracts can impair measurement.14\nPopulation distribution of test parameters\nA single score of overall RNFL thickness averaged\nover 12 clock-hour thicknesses is compared with a\nnormative database derived from responses from\n350 individuals aged between 20 and 80 years.81\nAn abnormal result is defined as below 5% level\ncompared with the normal population. The\ndistribution of OCT parameters has not been\ndescribed in a population setting.\nRetinal thickness analyser\nThe retinal thickness analyser (RTA), commercially\navailable since 2000 (Talia), combines a colour\ndigital fundus camera with a laser-based system\n(helium\u2013neon laser, wavelength 543 nm) for\nmeasuring nerve fibre layer thickness. One scan\ncovers 3 \u00d7 3 mm, which consists of 16 optical capital\ncross-sections with the laser. Each cross-section is\n187 \u00b5m apart and 3 mm long. In the posterior pole\nthickness mode, five such scans at the centre, super\ntemporal and infer temporal, and superonasal and\ninferonasal areas of the posterior pole, which cover\nan area of 6 mm \u00d7 6 mm, are performed for each\nmeasurement. The performance of the RTA is\naffected by media opacities. \nVisual function tests\nFrequency doubling technology\nThe clinical test procedure measures contrast\nthreshold in 19 visual field locations within the\ncentral 20 degrees of the visual field (C-20\u00b0). It\ncan be used in threshold and suprathreshold\nscreening mode. In the suprathreshold mode it\ntakes about 1 minute per eye. Recently, FDT\nMatrix, a 24-2 version of frequency doubling\ntechnology (FDT), has been introduced. FDT is\nportable and user friendly, and moderate\nuncorrected refractive errors, a common finding\nin the general population, do not appear to\ninterfere with FDT testing.\nPopulation distribution of test parameters\nNormative data were based on examination of 407\nhealthy people, aged between 14 and 85 years, to\nprovide a basis for establishing the probability\nplots for FDT perimetry.82 Using the C-20\u00b0\u20131\nalgorithm, the initial level presented would be\ndetected by 99% of the normal population of a\nparticular age, and is therefore designed to have a\nhigh specificity. Using the C-20\u00b0\u20135 algorithm the\ninitial level presented would be detected by 95% of\nthe normal population of a particular age and is\ntherefore a test aimed to optimise sensitivity.\nMotion detection perimetry \nThis test measures the ability to detect movement\nin the peripheral retina, which may be impaired in\nglaucoma. There are several types of stimuli that\ncan be used to explore motion sensitivity: a line, a\ndot or a patch of dots. Motion detection perimetry\n(MDP) takes longer and may be more difficult for\npeople to perform than standard perimetry,\nalthough its reliability appears not to be affected\nby cataract or pupil size. There is, as yet, no\ncommercially available instrument, and the\nprinciple of motion detection as a screening tool\nfor OAG needs further evaluation.83\nOculokinetic perimetry\nOculokinetic perimetry (OKP) with the Damato\nchart is a simple and inexpensive visual field test\ndevice. Damato campimetry consists of 20\nnumbers located on a flat, white card within the\ncentral 30 degrees of visual field. The subject is\nrequired to refixate from number to number,\nsequentially reporting whether the central 1.5-mm\nblack spot is visible. There is a 40-cm hinged piece\nthat serves to maintain the appropriate test\ndistance and occludes the non-tested eye. Any\npoint missed, other than the physiological blind\nspot area, is confirmed once before considering it\na true missed point. A modified version is\ncurrently available (free of charge) on the\nInternet.84,85 This test, either in card form or web\nbased, is quick, simple and available, and if of\nsufficient diagnostic validity would be valuable as a\nscreening test.\nShort-wavelength automated perimetry\nShort-wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP) is\na modification of automated static threshold\nperimetry and is purported to detect very early\nloss of sensitivity in the visual field. SWAP uses a\nyellow background and large, blue stimuli to test\nthe blue cones. The blue cone system is slower and\nhas a low visual acuity (about 20\/200). As a\nconsequence, the stimulus is perceived as fuzzy,\nand the test is more difficult and time-consuming.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n11\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.Uncorrected refractive errors have less of an effect\non the thresholds determined by SWAP, but lens\nopacities tend to result in profoundly depressed\nfields that are difficult to interpret. \nPopulation distribution of test parameters\nGlaucomatous visual field defects include,\nclassically, arcuate scotomas within the central\n25 degrees, nasal step, diffuse loss of sensitivity,\nhemispheric loss and eventually only a central\nisland of vision remaining. There are many\ndefinitions of abnormality based on the number of\nabnormal points, the pattern of visual field loss,\nthe depth of the defect and the glaucoma\nhemifield test (GHT). Normative databases are\nestablished for standard automated perimetry14,86\nand for the more recent Swedish interactive\nthreshold algorithms (SITA) based on 330 people\nwith no evidence of OAG.87\nThe GHT is widely used to distinguish between\nabnormal and normal results on standard\nautomated perimetry.88 The GHT is based on a\ncomparison of the expected sensitivity in the\nsuperior hemifield to the inferior hemifield. On\nstandard SAP testing, the GHT is reported as\nabnormally high sensitivity, within normal limits,\ngeneralised reduction in sensitivity,\nborderline\/generalised reduction in sensitivity,\nborderline, and outside normal limits. The latter\ntwo classifications generally are taken as suspicious\nof glaucoma.\nStandard automated perimetry\nStandard automated perimetry (SAP) is considered\nto be the reference standard in visual field\nexamination of glaucomatous patients. SAP\nestimates the threshold sensitivity of several points\nwithin the visual field. The target locations remain\nconstant and the brightness is modified in a\nstaircase approach to estimate the sensitivity. SAP\nis able to quantify the reliability, and compare the\nactual examination with an age-matched normal\ndatabase. Examination of the visual field in\nglaucoma is usually limited to the central 30- or\n24-degree area, since almost all clinically relevant\ndefects fall within this area. The most commonly\nused automated perimeter in the UK in\nophthalmology clinics is the Humphrey perimeter,\nnow with SITA, which speeds up the testing\nprocess. \nSuprathreshold testing with automated perimetry\ninvolves the use of stimuli that are of greater\nintensity than the presumed threshold at each\nlocation. This test strategy does not quantify the\ndepth of visual field defects, but is much quicker\nthan threshold testing.\nThe proportion of people able to undertake the\ntest reliably, and the need for confirmatory testing,\ncould limit the usefulness of standard automated\nperimetry as a screening test. However, perimetry\ndoes have the advantage of its availability, in that\nmost community optometric practices are\nequipped with automated perimeters.\nScreening tests for glaucoma\n12I\nn this chapter an overview of methods is\npresented including the clinical pathways \nand details of the structure of the economic\nmodel. This overview is used to provide a \nstructure to the rest of this report. Data related \nto the issues and methods used are reported \nin subsequent chapters as described towards the\nend of the section \u2018Economic model\u2019 (p. 15).\nDeveloping the screening\npathways and the economic\nmodel\nScreening pathways\nThere are various options for a screening\nprogramme. The options were explored by\npersonal communication with UK experts in the\ndiagnosis and management of OAG\n(ophthalmologists and optometrists).\nThe key questions asked were:\n\u25cf Who should be invited for screening and how\nwould these groups be identified?\n\u25cf Which of the many candidate screening tests or\ncombinations of tests should be used to screen\nfor OAG? \n\u25cf Should level of IOP be used as part of a\nscreening strategy and, if so, what cut-off of IOP\nshould be used?\n\u25cf Where should screening take place and who\nshould perform it?\n\u25cf Should screen-positive people be diagnosed \nand managed in primary care by optometrists\nor in secondary care either by ophthalmologists\nor a supervised care glaucoma diagnostic\nservice?\nThe pathways were presented to the following\npatients and professional groups for refinement: a\nmeeting of the European Glaucoma Society in\nBrussels, October 2005; a meeting with patient\nrepresentatives from the International Glaucoma\nAssociation (IGA) convened in Aberdeen, October\n2005; and an advisory group to the NSC on\nscreening for OAG in the UK, convened in\nNovember 2005. The latter group consisted of\nrepresentatives of specialist societies,\nophthalmology, optometry, nurses and a patient\ngroup.\nAs described in Chapter 3, many potential\nscreening tests are now available. There was no\nconsensus on which test or combination of tests\nshould be recommended as a screening test. As\nexplained in Chapter 2, the level of IOP does not\ndefine OAG, but the risk of OAG increases with\nincreasing IOP and the rate of progression may\nalso correlate with higher IOP. There was a\ngeneral consensus on the inclusion of IOP level to\nidentify people of high risk of developing severe\nglaucoma, and an IOP of 26 mmHg was generally\nagreed as a cut-off. There were concerns that this\nwould miss a significant number of cases of low-\npressure OAG and therefore an additional test or\ntests for people with an IOP below 26 mmHg\nshould be considered. \nIt was generally agreed that screening should start\nat 50 years, but for higher risk groups (e.g. people\nwith a family history of OAG or of African\nethnicity), screening at 40 years should be\nconsidered. It was agreed that identifying siblings\nof newly diagnosed OAG was not currently\nfeasible. If such an approach to screening were to\nbe implemented a register of incident OAG cases\nwould be required.\nThe high demand on already stretched hospital\neye departments was highlighted as a concern if a\npopulation screening programme was introduced.\nHowever, for the purpose of this evaluation, the\nadvisory group to the NSC felt that this project\nshould evaluate the performance of the tests and\nthe impact on the number of cases detected, but\nthat this should be modelled through the existing\ndiagnostic pathway where suspected cases are\nreferred to hospital eye departments as if there\nwere the capacity to do this. If screening appeared\nviable, further research would be needed to\nevaluate the best strategy for managing the newly\ndiagnosed cases.\nThe outcomes of these discussions led to the\ndevelopment of two alternative strategies for a\nscreening programme, and the economic model\nwas developed to compare these with the current\nsituation of opportunistic screening.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n13\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

Individuals\nwho test positive are referred to secondary care for\ndiagnosis by an ophthalmologist (i.e. the reference\ndiagnosis).\nScreening strategies\nBoth potential screening strategies considered\nwould involve inviting a prespecified cohort of \nat-risk individuals for screening. At-risk groups\nmay be identified on the basis of age and another\nfactor such as family history of OAG or ethnicity.\nScreening by invitation to a glaucoma-trained\noptometrist\nIn the first of the screening strategies considered\ntesting would be performed by a glaucoma\noptometrist (Figure 6). Glaucoma-trained\noptometrists are optometrists who have received\nadditional training in glaucoma diagnosis and\nmanagement and have been accredited, usually by\nassessment by a consultant ophthalmologist\nspecialising in glaucoma. The glaucoma\noptometrist would perform a full ophthalmic\nexamination, measurement of the IOP, and\nexamination of the optic nerve and visual fields,\nusing the equipment available in the particular\noptometric practice. People considered to have\nglaucoma, or to be highly suspect of glaucoma\nwould be referred to an ophthalmologist for a\ndefinitive diagnosis, as in current practice. Other\nsignificant eye pathology might also be identified\nby the glaucoma optometrist, although this\npossibility has not been included in the economic\nmodel described below. Furthermore, with this\nstrategy some of the cases of OAG may still be\nidentified by opportunistic screening. \nScreening by a technician\nIn the second screening strategy the population to\nbe screened would be invited to a primary care\nsetting to undergo a measure of IOP and a single\nscreening test by a technician or nurse, who has\nreceived some training (Figure 7). \nThis screening pathway incorporates IOP\nmeasurement by applanation tonometry, with a\ncut-off of an IOP of at least 26 mmHg being used\nto identify groups at higher pretest probability of\ndeveloping serious OAG. A second test is used for\npeople with an IOP below 26 mmHg. The choice\nof second test depends on which of the alternative\ntests has the best balance of diagnostic accuracy,\nthe proportion of people able to do the test and\navailability. People with an IOP of at least\n26 mmHg, and people with an IOP below\n26 mmHg and positive on the second test would\nbe referred for diagnostic assessment by a\nglaucoma-accredited optometrist. People testing\nnegative on the second test are not referred for\nfurther testing and are recalled for further\nscreening in the next cycle.

The\npathways indicate that screening would be best\nconsidered as an event that will be repeated at\ndiscrete time intervals. Furthermore, as glaucoma\nis a chronic condition, which progresses slowly\nover time, the model should reflect timing of both\nscreening and disease progression. For this reason\na Markov modelling approach was adopted. A\nMarkov model can be used to represent the logical\nand temporal sequence of events following the\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n15\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

Three Markov submodels were\ndeveloped and run in parallel. Each submodel\nrepresented one of the three strategies outlined\nabove. The model parameters and the data are\npresented in the section \u2018Economic evaluation of\nscreening for OAG\u2019 (p. 105). The results of these\nsub-models presented in this chapter were\ncompared to obtain the final cost-effectiveness\nresults, which are presented in \u2018Results of base-\ncase analysis and sensitivity analysis on the base\u2019\n(p. 115).\nThe model\nTypically, Markov models have states (e.g. Markov\nstates) in which individuals stay for a period of\ntime called a \u2018cycle\u2019. The cycle must be a period\nrelevant to the condition considered (e.g.\n6 months, 1 year). At the end of each cycle,\nindividuals can remain in the state in which they\nstarted the cycle or move to a different state. The\nprobabilities of moving from one state to another\nare called transition probabilities. In each state,\nthe model will assign costs and benefits for each\nindividual according to different interventions\nand\/or the time spent in the state. In these\nmodels, there must be at least one absorbing state,\ntypically death, from which the person will not be\nable to leave.\nFigure 8 shows a simplified version of the model\nused for the base-case analysis. In this figure the\nstates are presented as ovals while the arrows show\nthe possible directions in which individuals could\nmove at the end of each cycle, depending on the\ntransition probabilities. The states considered in\nthe model were those thought to reflect possible\npaths for normal and glaucoma individuals. The\ntop line in Figure 8 represents the possible path for\nundiagnosed individuals, while the bottom section\nof the figure reflects the glaucoma progression for\ntreated patients. \nGlaucoma states were defined in terms of severity\nof disease; namely, observation, glaucoma mild,\nglaucoma moderate, glaucoma severe and visual\nimpairment. There is no universally agreed\nstaging system for OAG, and there are limited\ndata on utility values according to glaucoma\nseverity (see \u2018Health state utilities\u2019, p. 112, for\ndetails). Therefore, an economic project\nmanagement group, including three economists\nand three ophthalmologists, agreed the\nclassification of health states. The severity of\ndisease was based on binocular visual field loss.\nThe detailed description of binocular visual field\nloss was adapted from a scoring system of the\nintegrated visual field, whereby uniocular visual\nfield analyses are integrated into a single\nbinocular field without additional testing, \nreported by Crabb and colleagues.89,90 The\ndefinitions of health states are described in \nTable 1.\nOverview of methods and definitions\n16\nDead\nDisease progression\nundiagnosed \nDisease progression,\ntreated patients\nGlaucoma\nmoderate\nGlaucoma\nmild\nTreatment\nglaucoma mild\nGlaucoma\nsevere\nVisual\nimpairment\nNormal\nTreatment\nglaucoma\nmoderate \nTreatment\nglaucoma\nsevere\nObservation\nFIGURE 8 Markov model for OAGThe treatment states refer to treated disease at\neach stage. The modality of treatment, either IOP-\nlowering eye drops, laser or surgery or any\ncombination thereof, is not specified for a\ntreatment state. A treatment state refers to any\nmodality or combination treatment for each stage\nof severity.\nAccording to whether the individual has or has not\ngot glaucoma, he or she would start in the model\nin a normal state or in an undiagnosed glaucoma\nstate. As time passes, the normal individuals could\ndevelop glaucoma (e.g. new incident cases of\nglaucoma), while those with glaucoma could\nprogress into further stages of the disease until\nthey eventually become visually impaired. These\nstates represent the true condition of the\nindividual. There are three treatment states in\nFigure 8, which vary according to the severity of\nglaucoma being treated. An observation state\nwhere individuals without a definite diagnosis\nremain until a further diagnosis decision is made\nis also included in the model. The observation\nstate was built up as \u2018tunnel states\u2019; that is, a\nperson is observed for a definite period within\nwhich a decision is made about whether or not\nOAG is present. More details on the observation\nstates are provided below. \nOAG is not reversible and this is reflected in the\nmodel (Figure 8). It is not possible to return to the\nnormal state or to a less severe glaucoma state\nfrom any glaucoma state. The absorbing state in\nthe model is death. Any individual can move into\nthis state from any other state within the model.\nThe model allows for a cohort of the population,\nsome with OAG, to pass through different\nstrategies. The intuitive idea behind the model is\nto identify the strategy that leads to the largest\nproportion of individuals with OAG crossing the\nbridge into treatment (Figure 8). Figures 50\u201352 in\nAppendix 1 show complete versions of the model. \nThe diagnosis of OAG within the model\nOphthalmologist involvement within the model\nFour types of professional are explicitly considered\nin the model. These are the technician, the\noptometrist, the glaucoma optometrist (GO) and\nthe ophthalmologist. The main difference between\nthem within the model is their ability to diagnose\nOAG, which varies from a simple reading of an\nequipment outcome by the technician to the\nassumed gold-standard assessment by the\nophthalmologist used in the base-case analysis.\nOphthalmologists are involved as the final stage of\ndiagnosis in all three strategies and their diagnosis\nis considered to be the gold standard in the\nanalyses presented in this study. Nevertheless, the\nmodel structure allows this assumption to be\nrelaxed if data were to become available. For any\nperson assessed by the ophthalmologist the\nfollowing decision structure is used (Figure 9). If\nthe ophthalmologist\u2019s assessment is positive, they\nwill decide to treat the patient, although the\nmodel structure allows this to be either a true or a\nfalse positive. If the assessment is negative, there\nwill be two options: to discharge or to keep under\nobservation. The decision to place someone under\nobservation would be appropriate if the\nophthalmologist felt, for whatever reason, that the\nindividual was at high risk of developing\nglaucoma.\nAs stated above, the final stage of the diagnosis is\nalways the ophthalmologist. Figure 10 shows the\npossible paths for the normal state. Within the\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n17\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

In such a situation the person would at\nthe end of the cycle move into the \u2018treatment\n(normal)\u2019 state or progress into \u2018treatment\n(glaucoma mild)\u2019 state. If the assessment is\nnegative, the ophthalmologist can decide to\ndischarge the patient or keep the person under\nobservation. If the person is discharged it is\npossible that over the duration of the cycle they\nmay go on to develop OAG. The likelihood of \nthis happening would be dictated by the \nexpected incidence of OAG over the cycle length\n(i.e. the annual incidence of OAG). For a person\nkept under observation it is possible that they will\ndevelop OAG while under observation. The\nlikelihood of this happening is again dictated \nby the annual incidence of OAG. Should the\nperson develop OAG then this will be \ndiagnosed by the ophthalmologist and treatment\nstarted. \nFigure 11 shows a similar Markov tree layout for\nthe \u2018glaucoma mild\u2019 state case. In the analyses\npresented in this report it has been assumed that\nall people with mild glaucoma referred to the\nophthalmologist will be correctly diagnosed as\nhaving OAG and will commence treatment.\nTreatment, on average, would be expected to\ndelay the progression of disease, but not prevent\nprogression for all people. For this reason people\ndiagnosed with OAG may move into the states of\n\u2018treatment (glaucoma mild)\u2019 or \u2018treatment\n(glaucoma moderate)\u2019. The likelihood of moving\nto either of these two states will be determined by\nOverview of methods and definitions\n18\nGlaucoma\n(true positive)\nPositive\nNegative\nOphthalmologist\ntest\/assessment\nNo glaucoma\n(false positive)\nGlaucoma\n(false negative)\nNo glaucoma\n(true negative)\nTreat\nTreat\nNot to treat\nNot to treat\nObserve\nObserve\nFIGURE 9 Decision pathways for diagnosis by the ophthalmologist\nTreatment (normal)\nPositive\nOphthalmologist\ntest\/assessment\nTreatment (glaucoma mild)\nNormal\nDischarge\nObservation\nNegative\nGlaucoma mild\nObservation (normal)\nTreatment (glaucoma mild)\nFIGURE 10 Ophthalmologist involvement Markov tree: normal statethe annual risk of progression from mild to\nmoderate disease for treated cases.\nConceptually, if the diagnostic ability of the\nophthalmologist is less than perfect then it might\nbe possible for a person with mild OAG to be\nincorrectly diagnosed as negative. In such a\nsituation the ophthalmologist might discharge the\nperson, who would then face the risk of\nprogressing to more severe disease. The likelihood\nof progression would be equal to the annual risk\nof disease progression for untreated OAG. \nAlthough only considered as a hypothetical option\nwithin the model at present, it may be possible\nthat individuals incorrectly diagnosed as negative\nare still considered by the ophthalmologist as\nbeing suspect of OAG. In this situation such\npeople would enter the state \u2018observation\n(glaucoma mild)\u2019. In the initial period under\nobservation the patient would have the risk of the\ndisease progressing and moderate OAG\ndeveloping. If such progression should occur then\nit might be expected to be identified by the\nophthalmologist and treatment initiated. It is for\nthis reason that in Figure 11 one of the branches\nfollowing observation progresses to \u2018treatment\n(glaucoma moderate)\u2019 and not to \u2018observation\n(glaucoma moderate)\u2019.\nObservation state structure\nThe tree structure for this state is similar, no\nmatter what health state the person originates\nfrom. These states are modelled as a 5-year tunnel\nstate. Figure 12 shows the structure for the\n\u2018observation (normal)\u2019 state. As noted above and\ndescribed in Figure 8, this is the only observation\nstate allowed in the analyses presented in this\nreport (owing to the opthalmologist gold\nstandard\/perfect information assumption within\nthe model).\nA person coming from a normal state, who the\nophthalmologist wishes to observe, would enter\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n19\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

During the cycle\nlength of this state the ophthalmologist could\ndecide that the patient under observation does not\nhave OAG, or decide to keep the person under\nobservation. In the first situation, the person\nwould be discharged as \u2018normal\u2019 (i.e. no OAG).\nHowever, they would still face the risk of\ndeveloping OAG (based on likelihood of its\nincidence) and hence might progress into the state\nof \u2018glaucoma mild\u2019. Should this occur then this will\nnot be identified unless presenting to the\nophthalmologist at some future date.\nIf the ophthalmologist\u2019s judgement does not\nchange, the person will remain in observation for\na maximum of 5 years (five cycles of the model).\nIn any of these years the person would face the\nrisk of developing OAG. If this happens the\nperson will be automatically detected and\ntreatment initiated. \nAlthough this state is not possible in any of \nthe analyses presented in this report, Figure 13\nshows the Markov tree hypothetical situation of\npeople with mild OAG being observed [the\n\u2018observation (glaucoma mild)\u2019 state]. The\ndifference is that, when diagnosed, in this case as \na glaucoma mild patient, the person will not be\ndischarged but will commence treatment [i.e. enter\nthe \u2018treatment (glaucoma mild)\u2019 state].\nFurthermore, if the disease progresses to moderate\nOAG [the \u2018treatment (glaucoma moderate)\u2019 state]\nthen this will be identified and the patient will be\ntreated as a glaucoma moderate patient. The rest\nof the structure is similar to that depicted in\nFigure 12.\nThe strategies considered\nThe model considered one current practice\nstrategy and the two alternative screening\nstrategies as described in Figures 5\u20137. Current\npractice reflects current glaucoma detection by\nopportunistic case finding. The two alternative\nscreening strategies vary in how screening would\nbe organised; for example, an invitation for a\nscreening examination by a glaucoma-trained\noptometrist or for a simple test assessing \neither visual field loss or structural damage,\ntogether with a measurement of the IOP by a\ntechnician. The Markov models reflecting \nthese pathways are detailed in Appendix 1 \n(Figures 50\u201352).\nAs indicated above, the model has assumed that\nthe ophthalmologist is the gold standard and\nmakes a perfect diagnosis (e.g. specificity and\nsensitivity equal to 1) but, as described above, the\nmodel structure allows for the relaxation of this\nassumption. If the ophthalmologist assessment\nresult is negative, the individual could be\ndischarged or remain under observation (as\ndescribed above). If positive, the ophthalmologist\ninitiates treatment.\nFor all the screening strategies, people are invited\nfor screening at preselected screening intervals\n(e.g. every 3, 5 or 10 years) and they have the\nchoice of accepting or declining the invitation.\nThose who accept the invitation would go through\nthe screening process, while those who decline the\ninvitation would follow similar paths to the one\nthey would follow in no-screening years. For the\nyears for which screening does not occur it is\nOverview of methods and definitions\n20\nTreatment (glaucoma mild)\nTreatment\n(Glaucoma moderate)\nDiagnosed\nObservation \n(glaucoma mild)\nTreatment\n(glaucoma moderate)\nObservation\nGlaucoma mild\nGlaucoma moderate\nNo observation\n(out of tunnel state)\nNot diagnosed\nObservation\n(glaucoma mild)\nFIGURE 13 Observation (glaucoma mild) state Markov treeassumed that people might still be diagnosed\nusing the same procedures outlined for current\npractice (strategy 1).\nPopulating the model with parameter estimates\nTo provide estimates of relative effectiveness, cost\nand cost-effectiveness data, the model requires\nestimated values for a whole range of different\ntypes of parameters. Such parameter estimates\nshould be derived in a systematic and reproducible\nmanner to avoid bias caused by the distorted \nand selective use of data.91 The assembly of such\ndata need not necessarily be comprehensive;\nrather, effort should be focused on identifying \nthe most relevant data to the decision problem,\nwhich was in this case the comparison of\nalternative screening strategies for OAG for\na UK setting. \nA series of systematic reviews and focused searches\ncovering the different types of data required for\nthe economic model was therefore conducted. The\nmethods and results of these are reported in detail\nin subsequent chapters of this report. In brief, the\nbroad types of data required to populate the\neconomic model relate to:\n\u25cf the prevalence, incidence and risk of\nprogression of the disease; that is, its\nepidemiology and natural history (systematically\nassessed in Chapter 5)\n\u25cf the performance of the different strategies in\nterms of the accuracy of the screening and\ndiagnostic tests used (systematically assessed in\nChapter 6); the effectiveness of treatments for\nthose identified as having OAG (systematically\nreviewed in Chapter 7)\n\u25cf resource use and unit costs required to estimate\nthe costs of alternative screening strategies; the\nspecific parameters and methods used to\nprovide estimates that are relevant to a UK\ncontext are described in the section reporting\nthe detailed methods and results of the\neconomic evaluation (\u2018Economic evaluation of\nscreening for OAG\u2019, p. 105)\n\u25cf Health state utilities; the methods used to\nidentify UK-specific values are also described \nin \u2018Economic evaluation of screening for OAG\u2019\n(p. 105).\nIn addition to these data, the structure and\nconduct of the economic evaluation could be\nusefully informed by any previous economic\nevaluations. A review of such studies, as reported\nin \u2018Systematic review of cost-effectiveness of\nscreening for OAG\u2019 (p. 95), should indicate\nwhether further assessment of cost-effectiveness is\nworthwhile; it might also serve to identify an\nexisting model that could be readily adapted for\nthis study, or if the existing economic evaluations\nare limited it could provide a firm justification for\na new modelling exercise. Thus, a thorough review\nof the strengths and weaknesses of the existing\nstudies may help to ensure that a model will\nprovide as useful evidence as possible on cost-\neffectiveness. \nSearching for the evidence\nHighly sensitive electronic searches were\nundertaken to identify the evidence for this report.\nInitial searching was undertaken between January\nand April 2005, with the major searches updated\nduring November and December 2005.

Since OAG has no\nassociated symptoms and is often asymptomatic\nbefore the development of established visual field\nloss, there is a need to identify groups at a high\nrisk of developing glaucoma and quantify the level\nof risk.\nRisk factors have been identified from\nepidemiological studies. These are increasing age\nand IOP, ethnicity, family history of OAG in a first-\ndegree relative, myopia and diabetes. Identifiable\ngene mutations are implicated,92\u201396 but account\nfor only about 4% of cases of adult-onset OAG.97\nAlthough certain genetic subtypes are more likely\nto progress towards severe disease, based on\ncurrent knowledge of the inheritance of OAG,\ngenetic screening would not detect a substantial\nnumber of the currently undetected cases. \nThe aim of this systematic review was to determine\nthe incidence and prevalence of OAG in the UK\npopulation and to identify the magnitude of risk\nof OAG attributable to age, ethnicity, family\nhistory, myopia and diabetes.\nMethods\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nTypes of studies and participants\nPopulation-based studies, namely cohort and\ncross-sectional studies, investigating the risk of\ndeveloping OAG and the prevalence in the UK,\nwere included. Meta-analyses and systematic\nreviews of observational population-based studies\nwere also included. Preliminary searches identified\nfew UK studies and therefore other studies\nreporting similar populations, such as European,\nNorth American, Canadian or Australasian were\nsought. Studies in which the population was\ndefined at the hospital or clinic-based setting were\nexcluded, as participants were not considered to\nbe representative of the general population.\nStudies were also excluded when it was not\npossible to ascertain the type of glaucoma being\nassessed. The review was restricted to English-\nlanguage publications.\nTypes of risk factors and outcomes\nThe following variables were considered as risk\nfactors for OAG:\n\u25cf age: 40, 50, 60, 70 years\n\u25cf myopia: mild\/moderate ( 6 D); high (>6)\n\u25cf ethnicity\n\u25cf diabetes: types 1 and 2\n\u25cf family history: one or more first-degree\nrelative(s) with OAG\n\u25cf IOP.\nThe following outcome measures were considered:\n\u25cf number of OAG cases detected\n\u25cf number of mild, moderate and severe OAG\ncases detected\n\u25cf relative risk of OAG for each risk factor\nreported\n\u25cf relative risk of mild, moderate and severe OAG\nfor each risk factor\n\u25cf time to glaucoma diagnosis (mild, moderate\nand severe) according to level of IOP.\nData extraction strategy\nFour reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of\nall papers identified by the search strategy. Full\ntext copies of all potentially relevant studies were\nobtained and four reviewers independently\nassessed them for inclusion. Reviewers were not\nmasked to the names of studies\u2019 authors,\ninstitutions or sources of the reports. Any\nuncertainties in the data were resolved by\ndiscussion between reviewers.\nA data extraction form was developed to record\ndetails of the design of included studies, year of\npublication, year of study, country of study, sample\nsize, participation rate, method of recruitment,\neligibility criteria, diagnostic criteria for OAG,\noverall prevalence and prevalence by the risk\nfactors of interest, relative risk of OAG and\nincidence (Appendix 3). Data were single data\nextracted by the same four reviewers. \nQuality assessment strategy\nTwo reviewers (JB, TL) assessed the\nmethodological quality of the included studies.\nAny disagreements were resolved by consensus or\narbitration. The included studies were assessed to\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n25\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.\nChapter 5\nEpidemiology of open angle glaucomasee whether they contained the elements shown in\nTable 4. An acceptable diagnosis required a\nglaucomatous visual field defect with or without\nglaucomatous optic neuropathy. It was accepted\nthat the classification of glaucoma would vary\nbetween studies, and in particular that methods\nfor ascertaining visual field loss would have\nchanged from the studies conducted in the 1960s.\nA secure record for exposure (risk factor)\nassessment was considered to be through a clinical\nexamination or the examination of records. The\noverall quality of each study was summarised as\n(A) no major flaws or (B) possible important flaws.\nStudies were included when they rated \u2018A\u2019 in all\nfields. Exceptions were made to include \u2018B\u2019 studies\nwhen no better evidence was available. \nData synthesis\nPrevalence and incidence reported for an age\nrange were attributed to the age category to which\nthe midpoint was closest. Study estimates of\nprevalence came from definite cases of OAG\nexcluding probable and\/or possible cases. When\nthis information was not provided, it was assumed\nthat the rate presented in studies was for definite\ncases.\nThe prevalence of glaucoma was calculated as the\nnumber of participants diagnosed with glaucoma\ndivided by the number of participants screened.\nThe prevalence of OAG was calculated for the\nwhole population, and for those aged 40, 50, 60\nand 70 years. For each study, a standard error (SE)\nestimate was produced, using the large sample\nnormal approximation. Prevalence estimates were\npooled using the DerSimonian and Laird random\neffects method.98 A pooled estimate of the\nproportion of undetected OAG was produced\nusing the same methods. Since only one study99\nreported the prevalence of undetected OAG by\nage, the overall estimate of undetected OAG was\napplied to each age category to produce crude\nage-specific estimates. A crude age-specific\nestimate of the prevalence of undetected OAG was\ncalculated by multiplying the pooled prevalence\nestimate at that age by the pooled estimate of the\nproportion of previously undetected cases.\nIncidence was summarised for each age category\nas the mean and range for cases per 100,000 years\nat risk. No formal pooling was undertaken. No\nstudies provided data with which to estimate\nincidence for 40 year olds and therefore the values\nfor 50 year olds were used. Incidence estimates for\nthe UK were determined by dividing the number\nof cases newly diagnosed by the number of people\nat risk (population data were obtained from the\n2001 UK Census). \nCrude and adjusted relative risks (or odds ratios\ndepending on study design) of OAG for the risk\nfactors under investigation were abstracted. Where\ntwo or more studies contributed data, a random\neffects meta-analysis was undertaken using the\nDerSimonian and Laird method. If both an\nunadjusted and adjusted ratio were reported in a\nstudy, an age- and gender-adjusted odds ratio was\nused in the meta-analysis. A relative risk was\ngenerated when an adjusted odds ratio was not\nreported and raw data were available. \nA pooled prevalence was also calculated for the\nprevalence of OAG in the high-risk group under\neach risk factor. The number at risk in the UK\npopulation for each risk factor was determined by\napplying the pooled estimate to the 2001 UK\nCensus. Data obtained from the A-rated studies\ncontributed to the pooled estimates. Where no \nA-rated studies were available B-rated studies were\nused.\nHigh IOP was defined as one or more\nmeasurements with readings equal to or above\n26 mmHg. Other IOP cut-offs were also\ninvestigated. Participants with myopia were\ndefined as having one or more measurements with\nrefractive errors greater than 0.5 D, ascertained by\neither measurement of present spectacles or a\nEpidemiology of open angle glaucoma\n26\nTABLE 4 Quality assessment criteria\nCriterion Type of bias\nWere participants sampled adequately?

Family history of OAG was\ndefined as participants having any first-degree\nrelative affected by OAG confirmed by clinical\nexamination. Diabetes was defined as people on\ntreatment for diabetes (type 1 or 2) or those\ntesting positive on urinalysis, glycosylated\nhaemoglobin (HbA1c) or a glucose tolerance test.\nResults\nNumber and type of studies included\nThe study selection process is summarised in\nFigure 14. In total, 4383 reports were identified\nfrom the search for studies on epidemiology, risk\nand disease progression, of which 285 were\nselected for full assessment for this review. Ninety-\ntwo reports describing 27 studies met the inclusion\ncriteria for the review. In addition, one meta-\nanalysis was identified. The included studies and\nassociated references are listed in Appendix 4.\nNumber and type of studies excluded,\nwith reasons for specific exclusions\nA total of 192 reports was obtained but\nsubsequently excluded because they failed to meet\none or more of the inclusion criteria (Figure 14).\nThe majority of the exclusions were not\npopulation-based studies or the population was\nnot defined at the geographical level. (See\nAppendix 5 for further details.)\nStudy quality and characteristics of\nincluded studies\nQuality of available evidence\nThe results of the quality assessment of the\nincluded studies are summarised in Table 5. In\nmost studies (81%), participants were sampled\nadequately and selected from a relevant\npopulation. Suboptimal approaches to diagnose\nOAG (e.g. high IOP, absence of a visual test,\nbaring of the blind spot, case records,\nunstandardised criteria) were used in five studies\n(19%).100\u2013104 IOP, diabetes and myopia status were\nobtained from a secure record (examination or\nexamination records) in most studies. However,\nonly one (20%)105 obtained family history status\nfrom a secure source, by examination of first-\ndegree relatives of detected cases. Sixteen (59%)\nincluded studies specified the participation rate to\nbe greater than 75%; however, this information\nwas unclear in seven (26%) studies.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n27\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

The remaining eight\nstudies100\u2013104,118\u2013120 are also described in\nAppendix 6.\nStudies included in the review presented variations\nin relation to study settings, age of participants,\ntypes of exposures measured and the definition of\nOAG (Tables 6 and 7). Of the 19 eligible studies,\nfour took place in the UK,21,64,113,116 three in \nthe USA,111,114,122 two each in Australia,63,115\nItaly,106,107 Iceland110,117 and Sweden,28,109 and\none each in Ireland,108 Spain,99 Greece,112\nand The Netherlands.105\nThe participation rate ranged from 67%121 to\n92%.21 Four studies did not provide information\non participation rate. Sample size ranged from\n207116 to 32,918.28\nAll 19 studies gave details of participants\u2019 age.\nEight studies included participants aged 40 years\nold and all but seven studies did not have an\nupper age limit. Most studies involved mainly\nwhite populations. However, in one study 45%\n(n = 2394) of included participants were of black\nethnicity.114\nThe majority of studies selected participants from\na population register (census in eight, municipal\nregister in three and electoral register in one).\nOne study took participants from another\npopulation-based study.121 Two additional studies\ndrew participants from general medical practice\ngroups113,116 and one recruited participants after\ndelivering preliminary publicity campaign cards\ninviting people over 40 years of age in Bedford,\nUK, for a screening examination.64\nAll studies ascertained glaucoma status by means\nof a clinical examination. Questionnaires were\nused to ascertain exposure status of participants in\nthree studies.63,99,114\nDisease prevalence\nData on prevalence was grouped as undetected\nOAG and overall OAG. Undetected OAG refers to\nparticipants being newly diagnosed at screening.\nOverall OAG refers to both previously detected\nand undetected glaucoma. All 19 studies provided\ninformation on the prevalence of OAG with the\nmajority reporting undetected prevalence as well\nas the overall prevalence (Table 7). Estimates of the\noverall prevalence of OAG varied across studies,\nranging from 0.421 to 6.6%.117 The pooled\nprevalence rate from 19 studies was estimated to\nbe 2.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7 to 2.5].\nFor previously undetected OAG, the pooled\nprevalence rate was 1.4% (95% CI 1.0 to 1.9).\nFifteen studies contributed to this estimation and\nvalues ranged from 0.3108 to 3.3%.109 By applying\nthe pooled prevalence estimates to the UK\npopulation over 40 years of age, it was estimated\nthat there are approximately 569,000 people\naffected by OAG, of which 380,000 are undetected\ncases (Table 7, Figure 15). (The proportion of\npeople with undetected glaucoma across the\nstudies can be found in Appendix 6.)\nDisease incidence \nThe incidence of OAG was investigated in three\nstudies (Table 8).123\u2013125 Two of the studies\nestimated the incidence of OAG by conducting a\npopulation-based cohort study with an observation\nperiod of 5 years.

Incidence of\nOAG ranged from 30 to 181 cases per 100,000\npeople per year at 40 and 70 years of age,\nrespectively. By applying the pooled estimate for\neach age to the 2001 UK census population, the\nnumber of new cases in the UK is estimated to\nrange from 263 to 880 new cases for 40 and \n70 year olds per calendar year, respectively. It is\nnoteworthy that sample sizes in the older age\ncohorts are usually quite small and therefore the\nestimates presented in Table 9 may not reflect the\ntrue incidence among older people. In addition,\nthe ageing population in the studies may not be\nrepresentative of the general ageing population.\nFor those reasons, these incidence estimates\nshould be interpreted with caution.\nDisease severity \nFive studies provided information on disease\nseverity for participants; however, information was\nnot provided separately for the newly detected\ncases, and in the majority of cases disease status\nwas unclear (Table 10).71,108,114,117,126 In these\ncross-sectional studies the percentage of people\nwith moderate disease varies from approximately\n9%114 to 15.4%.126 Mild disease was reported in\nonly one study and was estimated to be 12.1%.114\nSevere disease was reported in three studies,\nvarying from 4%117 to 14.6%.108 Blind from\nglaucoma was reported in four studies, varying\nfrom 3%71 to 10.6%.114 There appeared to be\nheterogeneity between the studies regarding\nseverity definition and therefore these results\nshould be interpreted with caution. \nDemographic risk factors\nAge\nThe prevalence of OAG by age was reported in 16\nstudies (Table 11). There was no standardisation of\nage intervals across studies and therefore direct\ncomparisons were difficult. For the purpose of this\nreview, the focus was on age 40, 50, 60 and\n70 years as cut-offs. All studies consistently showed\nthat the prevalence of OAG increases with older\nage. The overall prevalence of OAG by age was 0.3\n(95% CI 0.1 to 0.5) in people aged 40 years and\nincreased steeply with age to 3.3% (95% CI 2.5 to\n4.0) in people aged 70 years. As the prevalence of\nundetected cases stratified by age was not reported\nin any of the included studies, it was assumed that\nthe proportion of undetected OAG does not vary\nacross age groups. The prevalence of undetected\nOAG was then estimated to range from 0.2 to\n2.1% in people aged 40 and 70 years, respectively\n(Table 11). Figure 15 shows the estimated number\nof people with undetected OAG in the UK,\nsteadily rising from 1761 at 40 years to 11,000\npeople at 70 years of age.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

The number of people of\nblack ethnicity (Caribbean, African, other and\nmixed) with OAG in the UK is estimated to be\napproximately 9000 for those aged between 40\nand 75 years. No studies reported data for other\nethnic populations.\nOcular risk factors\nIOP\nSeven studies described the prevalence of OAG by\na range of IOP levels.63,99,107,108,111,112,127 Across\nthe studies, the proportion of people with OAG\nwho had an IOP above 21 mmHg was consistently\nhigher than those who had an IOP of 21 mmHg\nor less (Table 12). The proportion of people with\nhigh IOP varied widely across studies. However, all\nbut one99 included cases with previously detected\nOAG, and thus already under glaucoma therapy,\nand therefore underestimate the true prevalence\nof OAG in people with high IOP. The reason for\nthe study by Coffey108 reporting such a low\nprevalence of glaucoma among those with high\nIOP was unclear, although the authors did not\nreport IOP measurements in 12 of the 36 OAG\ncases. Prevalence of IOP by higher IOP levels\n( 26 mmHg) was also investigated. The risk of\nhaving glaucoma for those with IOP\nmeasurements 26 mmHg or greater is estimated\nto be 13 times higher than that for those with\nlower IOP [relative risk (RR) 12.58, 95% CI 5.07\nto 31.24]; of note was that only newly detected\ncases contributed to the estimation of this relative\nrisk.127\nMyopia\nPrevalence rates of OAG for those with and\nwithout myopia were available from four studies\n(Table 13).128\u2013131 The proportion of people with\nOAG appeared to be higher in participants with\nmyopia than in those without myopia. The\nprevalence of OAG among people with myopia\nranged from 1.4 to 4.3%, with a pooled estimate\nof 2.7% (95% CI 1.5 to 3.9). The pooled relative\nrisk of OAG among participants with myopia (any\ndefinition) compared with non-myopes was\nestimated to be 1.88 (95% CI 1.53 to 2.31). This\nresult should be treated with caution as there was\nno standardisation on the definition of myopia\nacross the studies and therefore the risk for low\n(<\u20136 D) and moderate (>\u20136 D) could not be\ndetermined. \nNon-ocular risk factors\nDiabetes\nThe prevalence of OAG by diabetes status was\nreported in four studies that established diabetes\nEpidemiology of open angle glaucoma\n34\n0\n2000\n4000\n6000\n8000\n10,000\n12,000\n14,000\n16,000\n18,000\n40 50 60 70\nN\nu\nm\nb\ne\nr\n \nw\ni\nt\nh\n \nO\nA\nG\nOverall OAG\nUndetected OAG\nAge (years)\nFIGURE 15 Estimated number of people with OAG in the UK at specific agesby clinical tests.22,105,122,132 Three of those provided\nadjusted estimates for odds ratios105,122,132 (Table\n14). The prevalence of OAG among participants\nwith diabetes varied from 1.2%105 to 5.5%,122 with\na pooled estimate of 3.3% (95% CI 1.8 to 4.8%). As\nshown in Table 14, this investigation demonstrated\nalmost twice the risk of OAG onset among people\nwith diabetes when compared with people without\ndiabetes (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.69). The\nnumber of those with diabetes with OAG in the UK\nis estimated to be approximately 49,300 for those\naged over 45 years.\nFamily history\nThe relationship between family history of\nglaucoma and OAG was investigated in five\nstudies.99,130,133\u2013135 Only four presented data\nsufficiently similar to allow for quantitative\nsynthesis.130,133\u2013135 However, the Rotterdam\nStudy135 was removed from the analysis because\ntheir uptake rate was low (<75%). The included\nstudies reported adjusted odds ratios estimates\n(Table 15). The prevalence of OAG among\nparticipants with a positive family history varied\nfrom 4.2 to 8.6%, with a pooled estimate of 6.7%\n(95% CI 5.0 to 8.4). The meta-analysis showed\nthat a family history of glaucoma is associated with\na three-fold excess age-adjusted risk of OAG\n(RR 3.14, 95% CI 2.32 to 4.25) (Table 16).

This\nstudy investigated the relationship of OAG with\nfamily history by means of a nested case\u2013control\nstudy and was initially excluded from this analysis\nbecause of the high degree of uncertainty\nsurrounding the results owing to its small sample\nsize. However, it was the only study that\nascertained a positive family history by examining\nfirst-degree relatives of patients with glaucoma\nand control subjects from the population-based\nRotterdam Study.\nDiscussion\nIn this chapter a systematic review has provided\nthe basis for estimates of the prevalence of OAG in\nWestern countries and associated risk factors were\nevaluated. The results support an association\nbetween OAG and raised IOP, myopia, diabetes,\nage, family history and black ethnicity. There were\ninsufficient data to estimate the risk of OAG for\nother ethnic minority groups in the UK.\nInclusion criteria\nGiven the aetiological focus of this systematic\nreview, study designs such as population-based\ncross-sectional and cohort studies were considered\nthe most appropriate sources of evidence on the\nprevalence and incidence of OAG. As Beral136 and\nDickersin137 pointed out, if associations detected\nby those studies are causal, even small increased\nrisks are likely to have a large public health impact\nwhen exposure is common.136,137 Study designs\nsuch as these are, however, subject to many\nalternative interpretations because of the scope for\nthe results to be biased or confounded.138 In\naddition, the published epidemiological literature\nis unquestionably heterogeneous.137 Studies\nnaturally vary in terms of participants\u2019\ncharacteristics or on the methods used to assess\nexposure and outcomes. The presence of major\nheterogeneity among studies in a systematic review\nmeans that the results of any statistical synthesis\nshould be treated with caution. \nOnly 19 of the 26 studies identified in this review\nwere considered to be similar enough to allow for\nmeaningful pooling. This selection was based on\nEpidemiology of open angle glaucoma\n36\nTABLE 15 Univariate and multivariate odds ratios reported by studies describing the relationship between glaucoma and family history\nStudy Crude OR 95% CI Adjusted OR 95% CI Comments \nMitchell, 2002133 2.7a 1.5 to 4.7 3.18 1.8 to 5.6 Adjusted for age, myopia, ocular\nhypertension, diabetes and IOP\nTielsch, 1994134 2.48 1.6 to 3.9 2.85 1.8 to 4.5 Adjusted for age and race\nWeih, 2001130 NR NR 3.7 2.0 to 6.7 Adjusted for age\nWolfs, 1998135 14.7a 1.7 to 130 16.6 1.9 to 147 Adjusted for age, gender, and the\npresence of diabetes or hypertension\na Age and gender adjusted.\nTABLE 16 Pooled prevalence estimates and respective adjusted relative risks stratified by ethnicity, IOP , myopia, diabetes and family\nhistory\nRisk factor Pooled prevalence (%)  Pooled adjusted  95% CI Number of studies\n(95% CI) relative risk\nBlack ethnicitya \u2013 3.80 2.56 to 5.64 1114\nIOP  26 mmHg \u2013 12.58 5.07 to 31.24 1127\nMyopia 2.7 (1.5 to 3.9) 1.88 1.53 to 2.31 4128\u2013131\nDiabetes 3.3 (1.8 to 4.8) 2.08 1.44 to 2.99 3105,122,132\nFamily history 6.7 (5.0 to 8.4) 3.14 2.32 to 4.25 3130,133,134\na African-American.the consideration that reasonable quality studies\nthat might contribute usable data for evidence\nsynthesis should have an adequate sampling\nmethod, an acceptable glaucoma definition, an\nexposure status obtained from a high-quality data\nsource, and a response rate greater than or equal\nto 75%.\nThis systematic review attempted to estimate the\ncurrent prevalence and incidence of OAG in the\nUK by applying the pooled estimates to the 2001\nUK Census population. There are numerous\nepidemiological surveys assessing the prevalence\nof glaucoma, but there are few cohort studies that\nprovide estimates of incidence. Only three studies\nhave been identified to report 5-year incidence\nrates for a cohort of people. Incidence studies are\nimportant to identify the risk of developing OAG\nand the number of new cases among a population\nof individuals previously unaffected. Prevalence\nstudies only measure the risk of having the\ndisease. To overcome this problem, some studies\nderived the incidence from already available\nprevalence data.139,140 Using this method,\nMinassian and colleagues140 in the UK estimated a\nhigher incidence than that observed in this study\n(approximately 14,000 as opposed to 11,000).\nThis difference may be because their estimate is\nbased on a much smaller population, including\nonly those aged above 65 years. \nThe systematic review includes the results of 14\nstudies conducted in eight different European\ncountries, as well as three in the USA and two in\nAustralia. The breadth of coverage across\ngeographical areas facilitates the consideration of\ngeneralisability, although this limited the data\navailable on the risk of glaucoma by ethnicity.\nIncluded studies\nOnly four UK surveys21,64,113,116 met the inclusion\ncriteria, two of which were performed during the\n1960s. For these two, the level of risk, population\nstructure, disease definition and methods of\ndiagnosis used may no longer be applicable to the\ncurrent situation. In addition, the results of studies\nperformed outside the UK may not be\ngeneralisable to a UK population owing to\ndifferences in aetiological and cultural factors.\nFurther studies would be useful to assess directly\nthe prevalence of OAG overall and by the different\nrisk factors deemed important for the UK. \nThe results of the review may be biased if the\nparticipation rates in the included studies are low.\nIn this review, six of the 19 studies included did\nnot provide information on participation rates. In\naddition, the majority of studies that provided this\ninformation did not give details about the\ncharacteristics of those who did not participate.\nThis provides a potential for bias if the risk of\nglaucoma among responders is systematically\ndifferent from that of non-responders. If non-\nresponders were to be more likely to be glaucoma\ncases (perhaps because they do not see the benefit\nof entering the study), then this would lead to\nunderestimation of the prevalence of OAG in the\npopulation. \nThe results of this systematic review must also be\ninterpreted in light of the quality of the included\nobservational studies. A validated checklist was not\nused to assess the quality of the included studies;\ninstead, a set of fields had to be satisfied in order\nfor a study to be considered good quality with no\nmajor flaws. The reason for this is that there are\nno validated checklists available to assess the\nquality of cross-sectional studies. Some may find\nthis checklist compact and oversimplified.\nHowever, studies failing to provide details on\neligibility criteria or where the credibility of \nstudy designs was questionable were excluded\nbefore the quality assessment stage. For example, \na cohort study that did not demonstrate the\noutcome of interest would have been excluded\nwith no further quality assessment conducted.\nNevertheless, despite efforts to focus only on \nthe best available data for some outcomes (e.g.\nrisk of OAG by family history) B-rated studies had\nto be included because of the lack of available\nevidence. Furthermore, even where data were\navailable they were not always reported in a \nformat suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis.\nFor example, Anton and colleagues99 evaluated\nthe relationship of OAG to family history of\nglaucoma, but results were presented as a\nproportion of those with OAG who had a positive\nfamily history. No data were provided on the\nproportion of people with family history in the\ntotal sample and, hence, a relative risk could not\nbe estimated. \nOne of the main difficulties in ascertaining an\nestimate of population prevalence and risk factors\nfor developing OAG is the lack of a reference\nstandard definition of OAG. Raised IOP is a risk\nfactor for developing OAG, but does not define its\npresence or absence. In this review, studies were\nincluded using a definition of OAG based on\nglaucomatous visual field loss, but the definition of\na glaucomatous visual field defect varied\nconsiderably across the studies. Perimetric\nmethods for ascertaining glaucomatous visual field\nloss have evolved over time. The review included\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n37\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.several studies conducted in the 1960s, and the\nstudies used a range of criteria to define a positive\ntest; therefore, the definition of a positive case\nmay vary between observers and studies and\naccount for some of the variation in prevalence\nrates between studies. Differential verification bias\nwas likely in some of the included\nstudies28,64,106\u2013108,110,112 in that only suspects on\nthe initial screen went on to a more extensive\nreference standard examination, and therefore\nsome of the cases may have been missed.\nTherefore, the prevalence may have been\nunderestimated by these studies.\nOAG and age\nThe association between OAG and age is very\nrobust. All included studies show that the\nprevalence of OAG is higher in older age groups.\nOne of the limitations in the calculation of a\npooled estimate of prevalence in this review is the\nfact that the age cut-offs used were different to\nthose reported in the included studies. In\naddition, specific age points (40, 50, 60, 70) were\nchosen rather than age ranges, and therefore the\nassumption that the prevalence is constant across a\nparticular age range may not be a true\nrepresentation.\nOAG and ethnicity\nOnly one study included in the review reported\ndata on the relationship between ethnicity and\nOAG.114 The risk of having OAG for African-\nAmericans was found to be approximately four\ntimes that for whites. OAG is not only more\nprevalent but also appears to be more severe in\nblack than in white people. This is possibly\nbecause the onset of disease is earlier for black\npeople than it is for white people.114 The relative\nrisk was not adjusted for other risk factors and\nshould therefore be treated with caution. In\naddition, the UK African Caribbean Eye Survey\nreported that not only darker skin but also place\nof origin in Africa are associated with a\nsignificantly increased risk of disease.120 The risk\nof glaucoma among black Africans was\nsignificantly higher than that in black Caribbeans.\nThis study was, however, a B-rated study, in that it\nwas based on a volunteer sample rather than a\nrandom sample of the population. \nStudies conducted in Africa, South America and\nAsia were not included, as it was felt that the level\nof risk in these settings would not necessarily be\nrepresentative of the risk observed in the same\nethnic groups living in the UK. Prevalence rates as\nhigh as 13% and 16% have been observed in\nCongo141 and Barbados.142\nThe increased risk associated with black ethnicity\nmay be a function of the excess co-morbidities in\nthese populations, including sickle cell disease,\nsystemic hypertension and diabetes.143 There may\nalso be ethnic differences in optic disc\nmorphology and an increased susceptibility at a\ngiven IOP level. However, there is likely to be\nheterogeneity within an ethnic population, and a\ncommon level of attributable risk to being of black\nethnicity may not be appropriate for different\ngeographical areas and subgroups within an ethnic\ngroup.144\nPeople of Hispanic ethnicity are also at increased\nrisk. In a large US population-based study of\ndefinite OAG in Latinos of Mexican ancestry,\nincluding more than 6000 participants who\nunderwent a complete ophthalmic examination\nfor determining glaucoma, the prevalence pattern\nof OAG was similar to that observed in those of\nblack ethnic origin in the USA and significantly\nhigher than in non-Hispanic whites.145\nOAG and IOP\nAcross the included studies the proportion of\npeople with OAG who had an IOP greater than\n21 mmHg was consistently higher than among\nthose who had an IOP less than 21 mmHg. Even\nthough a clear association was found between\nOAG and high IOP, it is possible that this\nrelationship could be stronger. The reason for this\nis that the included studies did not provide a\nseparate IOP measurement for those participants\nwho had previously detected glaucoma. It is very\nlikely that these participants will be receiving\npressure-lowering therapy, hence the possible\nunderestimation of the prevalence of OAG among\nthose with high IOP. One study provided sufficient\ndata to calculate the relative risk based on\nprevious undiagnosed cases.127 The sample was\nsmall and the estimate was unadjusted for other\nrisk factors and should therefore be treated with\ncaution.\nOAG and myopia\nThere is evidence that people with myopia are\nmore likely to develop OAG. One of the greatest\nlimitations in assessing the relationship between\nthese two conditions is the lack of a consensus\nacross the included studies on the definition of\nmyopia. For example, in the Visual Impairment\nProject,115 participants were classified as myopes\nwhen they had a refractive error worse than\n\u20130.5 D, whereas Grodum and colleagues28 used a\nrefractive error equal or worse than \u20132.0 D to\nclassify myopes. In addition, differences in the\ndefinition of glaucoma may lead to an\nEpidemiology of open angle glaucoma\n38underestimation of the prevalence of OAG among\npeople with myopia. However, overdiagnosis of\nglaucoma among people with myopia may also be\nresponsible for this association, because myopia is\nassociated with a number of non-glaucomatous\nvisual field defects and myopic discs can be\ndifficult to assess for glaucomatous damage.131\nOwing to limited evidence it was not possible to\nestimate the risk of glaucoma in people with low\nand moderate myopia and therefore the pooled\nestimates should be treated with caution. \nStructural differences in the myopic optic nerve\nmay make myopic eyes more susceptible to\nglaucomatous damage.129,131,146 Furthermore,\nglaucoma and myopia have a strong familial basis\nand therefore they may share a common genetic\nlink.129 A dose\u2013response relationship between\nOAG and myopia has been postulated (the higher\nthe myopia the more likely an individual would be\nto develop OAG). This relationship can be\nobserved in the Blue Mountains Eye Study,\nreporting an odds ratio of 3.3 for those with\nmoderate to high myopia ( \u20133.0 D) compared\nwith 2.3 in those with low myopia ( \u20131.0 to\n<\u20133.0 D).129\nOAG and diabetes\nCurrently available evidence suggests that there is a\npositive association between people with diabetes\nand OAG. The present study identified an\nincreased risk of OAG in those with diabetes. These\nresults are consistent with those of a meta-analysis\nperformed in 2004 (OR 1.57; 95% CI 1.13 to\n2.20).147 This meta-analysis had variations in the\neligibility criteria used to select studies compared\nwith the present study. Bonovas and colleagues147\nincluded studies that did not establish diabetes\nthrough a clinical examination as well as studies\nthat were conducted in African countries. These\nwere excluded in the review reported in this chapter\nbecause, in order to avoid detection bias, exposure\nshould be obtained from a secure record, and also\nbecause it is believed that the level of risk of OAG\nin people in countries of African descent is very\ndifferent from that observed in other populations. \nThe results reported in this chapter are consistent\nwith one population-based cohort study\nperformed in Scotland,102 and with one\npopulation-based cross-sectional study performed\nin England.116 Ellis and colleagues102 reported a\nrisk ratio of 1.57 for diabetes, although this result\nwas not statistically significant. This study was\nexcluded from the analysis owing to inadequate\nmethods used to select cases of glaucoma.\nWormald and colleagues120 reported a risk ratio of\n2.2 for diabetes, but this result was also not\nstatistically significant (95% CI 0.9 to 5.6). This\nstudy was excluded from the analysis because a\nvolunteer sample was used rather than a random\nsample and therefore it is likely that a healthy\nvolunteer effect was present in the results. The\nmethod of sampling is crucial to the avoidance of\nselection bias, and the observed increased risk in\npeople with diabetes and myopia may reflect this\ntype of bias, in that these groups may be more likely\nto be tested for glaucoma because they have regular\neye tests for diabetic eye disease and for spectacle\ncare for myopia. The impact of this bias would be\nto elevate artificially the relative risk of OAG. \nOAG and family history \nAll studies identified indicated that an association\nexists between OAG and a positive family history.\nHowever, none of the included studies proved to\nbe high quality (i.e. none was rated as \u2018A\u2019 in the\nquality assessment). There was no standardisation\non the type of family history reported across the\nfour included studies.115,133\u2013135 It is possible that\nthe level of risk varies according to the type of\nfamily history. For example, Tielsch and\ncolleagues134 and Mitchell and colleagues133 found\nsome variability in the strength of the association\nby the type of family member, in which the\nstrongest association was observed between\nsiblings. \nMost of the studies relied on verbal reporting of\nfamily history of glaucoma rather than a clinical\nexamination of relatives of glaucoma cases,\nmaking results prone to misclassification. Such\nmisclassification may be due to an\nunderascertainment of glaucoma cases since the\ndiagnostic criteria used for relatives may have\nbeen different from those used to diagnose the\ncases. Moreover, those who had a previous\ndiagnosis of glaucoma are more likely to recall and\ntherefore report a positive family history.133,134 In\nthe Rotterdam Study, attempts were made to\nminimise some of these biases by examining\nrelatives of glaucoma cases. However, a small\nsample size led to wide confidence intervals\nsurrounding the estimates, giving rise to a high\ndegree of uncertainty.135\nEven though an increased risk of glaucoma among\npeople with a positive family history has been\nobserved, the population attributable risk is low.\nThis was estimated in two studies.133,135 Both\nestimated a population attributable risk of\napproximately 16%, suggesting that other risk\nfactors largely determine the occurrence of\nglaucoma in the population.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n39\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

An estimated 67% of cases are not\ncurrently detected; a prevalence rate of 1.4%\n(95% CI 1.0 to 1.9) is estimated for those with\npreviously undiagnosed disease.\n\u25cf The overall prevalence of OAG by age ranges\nfrom 0.3 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.5) in people aged\n40 years, increasing steeply to 3.3% (95% CI \n2.5 to 4.0) in people aged 70 years. \n\u25cf The incidence of glaucoma is estimated as\nranging from 30 to 181 per 100,000 person-\nyears for people aged 50 and 70 years,\nrespectively.\n\u25cf Approximately 569,000 people are affected by\nOAG, of whom 380,000 are undetected cases.\nThe number of people with undetected disease\nsteadily rises from 1800 at 40 years, reaching\napproximately 11,000 at 70 years of age. One\ncan estimate that there are approximately\n11,000 new cases of OAG per year. \n\u25cf The risk of having glaucoma for those with IOP\nmeasurements 26 mmHg or greater is estimated\nto be 13 times higher than that for those with\nlower IOP.\n\u25cf The onset of disease appears to be earlier for\nblack people and the relative risk of OAG for\npeople of black ethnicity compared with white\npeople is estimated to be 3.80 (95% CI 2.56 to\n5.64).\n\u25cf There is almost twice the risk of OAG onset in\npeople with diabetes compared with those\nwithout diabetes (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.69).\n\u25cf A positive family history of glaucoma is\nassociated with OAG (RR 3.14, 95% CI 2.32 to\n4.25). The strongest association is for siblings of\nan affected case. \n\u25cf The proportion of people with OAG appeared\nto be higher in participants with myopia\ncompared with those without myopia. The\ncombined relative risk of OAG among\nparticipants with myopia compared with those\nwithout myopia was estimated to be 1.88 \n(95% CI 1.53 to 2.31).\nStrengths and limitations:\n\u25cf This comprehensive systematic review identified\n19 eligible studies. Data were sparse for some of\nthe review outcomes. For example, only one\nstudy provided data on the relationship between\nOAG and ethnicity. There were few data for the\nassessment of disease severity. Even though a\nnumber of studies reported family history, none\nof the included studies that contributed to an\noverall estimate was of high quality. Therefore,\nmore accurate risk information is necessary for\nbetter estimates to be developed in relation to\nfamily history and ethnicity.\n\u25cf An extensive literature search was conducted,\nbut only published data in English were sought.\nIt is possible that unpublished and non-English-\nlanguage studies were missed, with the direction\nof effect in these studies being unknown. \n\u25cf Strong associations between OAG and increased\nage, black ethnicity, high IOP, myopia, diabetes\nand family history are highlighted. However,\nthe prevalence of glaucoma by certain risk\nfactors may be overestimated, in particular\nwhen assessing family history, myopia and\ndiabetes as potential risk factors, as these\ngroups are more likely to have sight tests, and\ntherefore may be more likely to have glaucoma\ndiagnosed. Also, some studies did not adjust\nrelative risk estimates to other risk factor\nvariables. \n\u25cf Risk factor and OAG definitions varied\nconsiderably, causing the exclusion of several\nstudies because of poor reporting and\ninadequate criteria. \nFor future epidemiological studies, a standardised\ndefinition of OAG and improved reporting on how\nthe suspects and definite cases received the\nreference standard diagnostic assessment are\nrequired. Efforts should be directed to create a\ncollaborative group with the aim of standardising\ndata such that the results can be presented and\npooled with similar case definitions for similar\npopulations. Ideally, prevalence studies should\nreport IOP measurements for participants with\nnewly diagnosed (i.e. untreated) glaucoma, to allow\nthe determination of appropriate cut-offs for IOP\nas a diagnostic or prognostic indicator of OAG.\nEpidemiology of open angle glaucoma\n40Introduction\nThere are many potential tests or combinations of\ntests for detecting glaucoma (see Chapter 3). To\ndate, no single test or combination of tests has\nbeen identified as a definitive screening test for\nglaucoma. \nThe aim of this systematic review was to evaluate\nthe accuracy of candidate screening tests and to\nprovide details of the reliability of the tests and\nthe proportion of people able to complete each\ntest.\nMethods\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nTypes of study\nThe following types of study were included:\n\u25cf direct (head-to-head) studies in which both\nindex test(s), comparator test(s) and reference\nstandard test are done independently in the\nsame group of people\n\u25cf RCTs in which people are randomised to the\nindex and comparator test(s) and all receive the\nreference standard test. \nWhere there was insufficient evidence from direct\nstudies and RCTs, indirect (between-study)\ncomparisons were considered by meta-analysing\nstudies that compared each single test or\ncombination of tests with the reference standard\ntest, and comparing the meta-analyses of the\ndifferent tests. This type of study design, however,\nis less reliable than direct studies as differences in\ntest accuracy are susceptible to confounding factors\nbetween studies. The following types of study were\nconsidered for the indirect comparisons:\n\u25cf observational studies, including cohort studies,\nwith analysis data on at least 100 participants,\nin which the sample is created by identifying all\npeople presenting at the point of testing\n(without any reference to the test results)\n\u25cf case\u2013control studies in which two groups are\ncreated, one known to have the target disease\nand one known not to have the target disease,\nwhere it was reasonable to assume that all\nincluded had undergone the index and\nreference standard tests.\nPopulation-based studies and studies in a primary\ncare or hospital-based setting were considered\nwhere the participants were likely to be\nrepresentative of a screening situation or of a\nglaucoma suspect population referred from a GP\nor an optometric practice. Case\u2013control studies\nwhere the inclusion criteria were different for cases\nand controls were excluded; that is, studies\ncomparing severely diseased people with very\nhealthy controls or studies excluding people with\nother ocular disease such that the spectrum of\ndisease and non-disease was unlike that to be\nencountered in a screening situation. Also\nexcluded were case reports and studies\ninvestigating technical aspects of a test. \nTarget condition\nThe target condition was OAG (early, moderate or\nsevere).\nParticipants\nPeople over 40 years of age and those in the\nfollowing higher risk subgroups were included:\n\u25cf family history of glaucoma\n\u25cf black race\n\u25cf people with myopia\n\u25cf people with diabetes.\nThe criteria for defining myopia and diabetes\nwere loosely applied and definitions used by study\nauthors for these conditions were considered\nacceptable.\nIndex and comparator test(s)\nThe tests to be considered fell within three broad\ncategories:\n\u25cf structure\n\u2013 ophthalmoscopy\n\u2013 optic disc photography (including non-digital\nand digital monoscopic and stereoscopic\nphotography, and planimetric)\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n41\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

The primary reference standard test\nwas confirmed OAG on follow-up. This was\nconsidered the best reference standard, although it\nwas anticipated that few studies would use it.\nTherefore, also considered were studies where the\nreference standard was ophthalmologist-diagnosed\nOAG requiring treatment. This diagnosis can be\nbased on an assessment of the visual field and\/or\nthe optic disc, but without follow-up confirmation.\nEach reference standard might include one or\nmore of the screening tests against which it was\nbeing compared.\nStudies using a technology-based diagnostic test(s)\nresult alone as a reference standard were excluded. \nTypes of outcome\nTo be included, studies had to report relevant and\ninterpretable data on one of more of the following\ntypes of outcome:\n\u25cf the absolute numbers of true positives, false\npositives, false negatives and true negatives, or\nnumbers from which they could be computed,\nsuch as the sensitivity and specificity values\n\u25cf adverse events\n\u25cf acceptability of the tests to those who receive\nthem\n\u25cf reliability of the tests.\nIf the evidence allowed, it was planned to assess\ntest performance in early, moderate and severe\nglaucoma.\nData extraction strategy\nTwo reviewers (GM, MARS) screened the titles\n(and abstracts if available) of all reports identified\nby the search strategy. Full text copies of all studies\ndeemed to be potentially relevant were obtained\nand two reviewers (GM, MARS) independently\nassessed them for inclusion. Any disagreements\nwere resolved by consensus or arbitration by a\nthird party (JB).\nA data extraction form was developed and piloted.\nOne reviewer (GM or MARS) extracted details of\nstudy design, participants, index, comparator and\nreference standard tests, participant flow and\noutcome data. In the event of any uncertainty, a\nsecond reviewer (GM or MARS) provided advice\nand validated the data extraction.\nQuality assessment strategy\nQuality assessment was performed using the\nQUADAS tool. QUADAS is a recently developed\nquality assessment tool for use in systematic\nreviews of diagnostic studies.149 It was developed\nthrough a formal consensus method and was\nbased on empirical evidence. The original\nQUADAS checklist contained 14 questions. The\nQUADAS tool was adapted to make it more\napplicable to assessing the quality of studies of\ntests for detecting OAG. (See Appendix 7 for an\nexample of the modified checklist.)\nQuestion 1 concerns the representativeness of the\nspectrum of people assessed by the test (question\n1 of the original QUADAS checklist). This was\nsplit into two parts, depending on whether the\nstudy sample was (1) taken from an unscreened\npopulation with a glaucoma prevalence between\n>0 and 20% or (2) constructed from previously\nundiagnosed glaucoma patients but representative\nof those referred from primary care as suspect\nglaucoma. Case\u2013control studies were assessed on\nthe basis of whether the cases and controls could\nbe regarded as representative of those detected in\nprimary care. \nQuestion 2, concerning the reference standard\n(question 3 of the original QUADAS checklist),\nwas reworded to ask whether the reference\nstandard was follow-up confirmation of glaucoma\nScreening and diagnostic tests for open angle glaucoma\n42(i.e. glaucoma confirmed clinically by the\nlongitudinal follow-up of the patient), considered\nto be the best reference standard against which to\nmeasure tests for detecting OAG. Given the nature\nof the reference standard, the QUADAS question\non whether the period between reference standard\nand index test was short enough to be reasonably\nsure that the target condition did not change\nbetween the two tests was omitted (question 4 of\nthe original QUADAS checklist).\nQuestions 3 (partial verification bias), \n4 (differential verification bias), 5 (incorporation\nbias), 6 (test review bias), 7 (diagnostic review bias)\nand 10 (withdrawals from the study) remained\nunchanged (questions 5, 6, 7, 10, 11 and 14 of the\noriginal QUADAS checklist). Partial verification\nbias occurs when not all of the study participants\nare verified by a reference standard. Differential\nverification bias happens when some of the\npatients receiving the index test are verified by a\ndifferent reference standard. Incorporation bias\noccurs when the index test also forms part of the\nreference standard. Test review bias and diagnostic\nreview bias happen when interpretation of the\nresults of the index test is influenced by\nknowledge of the results of the reference standard,\nand vice versa.\nIt should be noted that in relation to\nincorporation bias (question 5), in glaucoma a\nsituation may occur whereby the index test may be\na test of visual function (e.g. FDT) and the\nreference standard may include a different test of\nvisual function (e.g. SAP). In such cases question 5\nwas marked as incorporation bias avoided, taking\nthe view that although both tests were of visual\nfunction they were actually different tests.\nHowever, in a situation such as this the sensitivity\nand specificity of the index test may be\noverestimated as the tests are measuring similar\noutcomes. The same situation may occur with\ndifferent tests that assess the structure of the eye\nwhen one is the index test and one forms part of\nthe reference standard, e.g. HRT II and\nophthalmoscopy. \nQuestion 8 is concerned with whether the same\nclinical data were available when the test results\nwere interpreted as would be available when the\ntest is used in practice (question 12 of the original\nQUADAS checklist). This question was split into\ntwo parts, depending on whether the study was a\nscreening or diagnostic accuracy study. It was\nassumed that in a screening situation in practice\nthe index test results alone would be used, but that\nfor studies of diagnostic test accuracy (cohort or\ncase\u2013control) in practice information from\nophthalmic examination and\/or information on\nco-morbidity might be used.\nQuestion 9 concerns the reporting of numbers \nof uninterpretable\/intermediate test results\n(question 13 of the original QUADAS checklist). \nIf uninterpretable\/intermediate results occur \nbut are not reported then this may lead to a\nbiased assessment of the test characteristics.\nTherefore, this question was retained and also\namended to include whether incomplete tests \nwere reported. \nItems relating to the quality of reporting in terms\nof the description of the selection criteria, the\nexecution of the index test, and the execution of\nthe reference standard test were omitted\n(questions 2, 8 and 9 of the original QUADAS\nchecklist). Three questions were added to the\nchecklist on whether the technology of the index\ntest was still current (question 11), whether the\nstudy provided a clear definition of what was\nconsidered a positive result (question 12), and\nwhether the definition of a positive test result was\ndetermined before the study was carried out\n(question 13).\nTwo reviewers (GM, MARS) independently\nassessed the quality of all included studies using\nthe modified version of QUADAS. Each of the 13\nquestions was checked as \u2018Yes\u2019, \u2018No\u2019 or \u2018Unclear\u2019.\nEach item was worded so that a rating of \u2018Yes\u2019 was\nalways optimal in terms of methodological quality.\nAny disagreements were resolved by consensus or\narbitration by a third party (JB). A \u2018higher quality\u2019\nstudy was considered to be one that was checked\nas \u2018Yes\u2019 to questions 1 (patient spectrum\nrepresentative), 3 and 4 (partial and differential\nverification bias avoided) and 6 and 7 (test review\nbias and diagnostic review bias avoided).\nSensitivity analysis was planned to assess whether\nthe results for higher quality studies differed\nsystematically from those of the other included\nstudies.\nData analysis \nThe results of the individual studies were\ntabulated and sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic\nodds ratios (DORs) calculated. A DOR combines\nsensitivity and specificity into a single summary of\ndiagnostic performance. If more than one\nthreshold level was reported in a given study a\nseparate 2 \u00d7 2 table was derived for each\nthreshold. Separate 2 \u00d7 2 tables were also\nproduced for relevant subgroups considered in the\nstudies.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n43\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.Relative diagnostic odds ratios (RDORs) were\ncalculated for studies comparing two or more tests\nin the same participants. A 95% confidence\ninterval was calculated under the assumption of\ntwo independent groups which will be conservative.\nInsufficient data were reported, however, to allow\na paired analysis to be undertaken.\nSummary performance of each test\nSummary receiver operating characteristic (SROC)\ncurves were produced for each test where two or\nmore studies reported estimates of sensitivity and\nspecificity. A second set of SROC curves was also\nproduced for a test-specific common cut-off. From\neach study reporting each test, a cut-off was\nchosen (the common cut-off) from among the\nvarious cut-offs reported. The aim was to select a\ncut-off that was broadly similar across studies\nreporting that test. The decision on which cut-off\nto select was made following discussion by two\nophthalmologists (JB and RS). Owing to the\nlimited number of studies identified, statistical\ninvestigation of the potential sources of\nheterogeneity was not undertaken. The F\ndistribution method was used for calculating the\nconfidence intervals for sensitivity and specificity\nfor individual studies,150 which were produced\nusing Metadisc software.151\nMeta-analysis models were fitted using the\nhierarchical summary receiver operating\ncharacteristic (HSROC) model152 in WinBUGS\n1.4.153 This model takes proper account of the\ndiseased and non-diseased sample sizes in each\nstudy, and allows estimation of random effects for\nthe threshold and accuracy effects. The SROC\ncurves from the HSROC models were produced on\nthe corresponding SROC plots. Summary\nsensitivity, specificity and DORs for each model\nwere reported as median and 95% credible interval\n(CrI). Credible intervals are the Bayesian equivalent\nof confidence intervals. Where two or more higher\nquality studies were available for a test, a model\nusing only these studies was also fitted. A\nsimplified model, which assumed a symmetrical\nSROC shape, was used where limited data caused\nconvergence problems under the full model.\nIndirect comparison between tests\nAll tests with two or more included studies were\nmodelled together in a single HSROC model to\ncompare formally the performance of the tests. A\nsymmetrical SROC model was assumed for all the\ntests. Pairwise differences in sensitivity and\nspecificity between tests were assessed from the\nmedian difference and the corresponding 95%\ncredible interval.\nResults\nNumber and type of studies included \nAppendix 8 lists the 82 studies published in 93\nreports that were included.\nAccuracy\nForty studies, published in 46 reports, met the\ninclusion criteria for the screening and diagnostic\naccuracy review. There were 20 population-based\nstudies representative of a screening\nsetting.21,72,99,100,106,112,115,154\u2013170 Twenty studies\nwere representative of a glaucoma suspect\npopulation referred from primary care, of which\neight were cohort studies22,171\u2013177 and 12 were\ncase\u2013control studies.178\u2013191\nUptake, interpretability, time taken to do test\nand reliability of test\nIn addition to the studies included in the review of\nscreening and diagnostic test accuracy that\ncontributed information on uptake,\ninterpretability of tests, time taken to do the test\nand reliability of the test, 47 reports also provided\ndata on these aspects. These studies did not\nprovide usable outcome data in terms of test\naccuracy, but otherwise met the review\u2019s inclusion\ncriteria.107,109,110,132,192\u2013234 Information on uptake,\ninterpretability and time taken to do the test is\ngiven in the results section for each test, while\nthose studies reporting reliability are listed in\nAppendix 9. \nNumber and type of studies excluded,\nwith reasons for specific exclusions\nFor the screening and diagnostic accuracy review,\n5918 titles and abstracts from the specific and\ngeneral searches were screened, from which 877\nwere selected for full-text assessment. Articles were\nexcluded because they failed to meet one or more\nof the specified inclusion criteria in terms of study\ndesign, participants, index tests, reference\nstandard or outcomes reported. Fifty-seven of the\nfull-text reports excluded were case\u2013control studies\nwhose participants were considered to be\nunrepresentative of those who would attend for\nscreening and are listed in Appendix 10. \nTabulation of quality of studies,\ncharacteristics of studies and evidence\nrating\nQuality of studies\nThe results of the quality assessment for the\nindividual studies are shown in Appendix 11.

None of the studies\ngave details of the time taken to perform the test. \nOptic disc photography\nQuality assessment\nSix studies enrolling over 7800 people reported\nthe test accuracy of optic disc photography,\nincluding two population-based studies,166,169 one\ncohort study175 and three case\u2013control\nstudies.188\u2013190 Figure 18 summarises the quality\nassessment for these studies. In four of the six\nstudies the participants were considered to be\nrepresentative of a screening setting166,169 or\ndiagnostic setting175,188 (i.e. people referred from\nprimary care with suspect glaucoma). Five of the\nsix studies were judged to be free from both\npartial and differential verification\nbias.166,169,175,188,189 In four studies both the index\ntest and the reference standard test were\ninterpreted without knowledge of each other\u2019s\nresults.166,169,175,190 The studies by Vitale and\ncolleagues,166 Wolfs and colleagues169 and Schultz\nand colleagues175 met all of the above criteria\nspecified for higher quality studies.\nAccuracy\nFigure 19(c) shows the sensitivity and specificity,\nwith 95% confidence intervals, for the six studies\nreporting optic disc photography at a common\ncut-off (for details of the common cut-off selected\nfor optic disc photography see Appendix 13). The\nstudy by Wollstein and colleagues190 aimed to\ndetect early-stage glaucoma.\nFigure 19(a) and (b) show, respectively, the SROC\nplots for all cut-offs for all studies, and the\ncommon cut-off. For all cut-offs, sensitivity ranged\nfrom 35% (cut-off of concave slopes and \nCDR   0.05 in the vertical than horizontal\ndirection)189 to 86% (cut-off of VCDR   0.5),175\nwhile specificity ranged from 59% (cutoff of\nVCDR   0.59)166 to 99.5% (cut-off of concave\nslopes and CDR   0.05 in the vertical than\nhorizontal direction).189 For the common cutoff,\nsensitivity ranged from 65%175 to 77%,166,188 while\nspecificity ranged from 59%166 to 98%.175 The\npooled sensitivity, specificity and DOR from the\nmeta-analysis models for the common cut-off were\n73% (95% CrI 61 to 83%), 89% (95% CrI 50 to\n99%) and 21.74 (95% CrI 3.07 to 148.30),\nrespectively (Figure 19d).\nTable 19 shows, where this information was\nreported, details of the optic disc photography,\nwhether or not participants\u2019 pupils were dilated\nand the clinical experience of those giving the\ntests.\nInterpretable results\nSeven population-based studies reported that\n16,957 (85.0%) of 19,950 participants provided\ninterpretable test results for optic disc\nphotography,110,155,157,159,166,168,169 while four\nprospective cohort studies reported that 499\n(89.7%) of 556 participants provided interpretable\ntest results,175,202,207,209 giving an overall rate for\nall studies of 85.1%.

meta-analysis\nmodels for the common cut-off were 78% (95%\nCrI 19 to 99%), 75% (95% CrI 57 to 87%) and\n10.14 (95% CrI 0.72 to 249.00), respectively\n(Figure 27d).\nInterpretable results\nThree population-based studies reported that\n2164 (91.8%) of 2357 participants provided\ninterpretable test results for FDT C-20-5,155,161,163\nwhile one prospective cohort study173 reported\nthat 223 (97.8%) of 228 participants provided\ninterpretable test results, giving an overall rate of\n92.3% for all studies. Two studies155,187 reported\nthe time taken to perform the test, which ranged\nfrom less than 45 seconds per eye for normal\nparticipants to approximately 2 minutes per eye\nfor those with advanced glaucoma.187\nFDT (C-20 full threshold and C-20 matrix)\nHeeg and colleagues,183,184 in a case\u2013control \nstudy set in The Netherlands, reported the\naccuracy of the FDT C-20 full threshold test. An\nabnormal test result was defined as more than one\ndepressed test point, p < 0.01, in the total\ndeviation probability plot (TD > 1). Table 20\nshows the sensitivity and specificity of the FDT C-\n20 full threshold test, both for all participants and\nfor a subgroup excluding those with early\nglaucoma, at cut-offs of TD greater than 1, 2 and\n3. As would be expected, for both the whole \ngroup and also the subgroup, sensitivity was\nhighest (90% and 100%, respectively) at a cut-off\nof TD greater than 1, while specificity was highest\n(both 88%) at TD greater than 3. In terms of\nquality assessment, the cases and controls were\njudged as being representative of a diagnostic\nsetting.\nSpry and colleagues,176 in a cohort study set in the\nUK, reported the test accuracy of the FDT C-20\nmatrix (Humphrey matrix 24-2). An abnormal test\nresult was defined as a GHT outside the normal\nlimit and\/or p < 0.05 with the pattern standard\ndeviation global index in one or both eyes. The\nstudy reported sensitivity of 100% and specificity\nof 27%. In terms of the quality of the study, the\nspectrum of people was considered to be\nrepresentative of a diagnostic setting, it was\njudged to be free from both partial and\ndifferential verification bias, and both the index\ntest and the reference standard test were\ninterpreted without knowledge of each other\u2019s\nresults, thereby meeting the criteria specified for\nhigher quality studies. \nOKP\nQuality assessment\nFour studies enrolling 768 people reported the\ntest accuracy of OKP, including two population-\nbased studies,154,170 and two case\u2013control\nstudies.180,182 Figure 28 summarises the quality\nassessment for these studies. In three of the four\nstudies the participants were considered to be\nrepresentative of a screening154,170 or diagnostic182\nsetting. The study by Yamada and colleagues170\nwas the only one judged to be free from both\npartial and differential verification bias and was\nalso the only study in which both the index test\nand the reference standard test were interpreted\nwithout knowledge of each other\u2019s results, thereby\nmeeting the criteria specified for higher quality\nstudies. \nAccuracy\nFigure 29(c) shows the sensitivity and specificity,\nwith 95% confidence intervals, for the four studies\nreporting OKP at a common cut-off (for details of\nthe common cut-off selected for OKP see\nAppendix 13). There was statistically significant\nheterogeneity, in terms of sensitivity, mainly due to\nthe study by Harper and colleagues.182 There was\nno obvious explanation for this heterogeneity in\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n59\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

In three of the\nfour studies, including the study by Harper and\ncolleagues, the participants were considered to be\nrepresentative of a screening154,170 or diagnostic182\nsetting, while the representativeness of the\nparticipants was unclear in the case-control study\nby Damato and colleagues.180 However, in contrast\nto the other three studies, in the study by Harper\nand colleagues182 there was minimal instruction\nand supervision. In preparation for the test, the\nparticipants were asked to read the test\ninstructions with no further assistance given,\nfollowing which they self-administered the test,\nunsupervised.182\nFigure 29(a) and (b) show, respectively, the SROC\nplots for all cut-offs for all studies and the\ncommon cut-off. For both all cut-offs and the\ncommon cut-off, sensitivity ranged from 25%182 to\n100%,154 while specificity ranged from 78%170 to\n94%.154,182 One reason for the high sensitivity\nreported by Christoffersen and colleagues154 was\nthat test negatives did not receive a reference\nstandard test to confirm this but were assumed to\nbe true negatives, so that the study reported no\nfalse negatives and therefore a sensitivity of 100%.\nYamada and colleagues170 also reported a high\nsensitivity rate (95%). However, this study\ncontained a higher than average prevalence of\nglaucoma (10.7%) and it would be expected that\nthe sensitivity of the test would therefore be higher\nin such a population compared with an average\nprevalence population. The pooled sensitivity,\nspecificity and DOR from the meta-analysis\nmodels for the common cut-off were 86% (95%\nCrI 29 to 100%), 90% (95% CrI 79 to 96%) and\n57.54 (95% CrI 4.42 to 1585.00), respectively\n(Figure 29d).\nInterpretable results\nTwo population-based studies reported that 362\n(97.1%) of 373 participants provided interpretable\ntest results for OKP,154,170 while one prospective\ncohort study reported that 16 (94.1%) of 17\nparticipants provided interpretable test results,212\ngiving an overall rate of 96.9% for all studies.\nThree studies reported the time taken to perform\nthe test,154,170,212 which ranged from\napproximately 3 minutes170 to 4 minutes212 per eye.\nSAP (suprathreshold)\nQuality assessment\nNine studies enrolling over 10,200 people\nreported the test accuracy of the SAP\nScreening and diagnostic tests for open angle glaucoma\n60\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\nSpectrum representative\nReference standard confirmed follow-up\nPartial verification bias avoided\nDifferential verification bias avoided\nIncorporation bias avoided\nTest review bias avoided\nDiagnostic review bias avoided\nClinical review bias avoided\nUninterpretable results reported\nWithdrawals explained\nIndex test technology current\nPositive result clearly defined\nPositive result defined prior to study\nYes\nNo\nUnclear\nFIGURE 28 OKP: summary of quality assessmentHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n61\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

The study\nwas judged to be free from partial verification bias\nbut not differential verification bias. Furthermore,\nthe index test was interpreted without knowledge\nof the results of the reference standard test, but\nnot vice versa. It should be noted that the\nreference standard was suboptimal for several\nreasons: the authors\u2019 definition of glaucoma\nexcluded people with IOP of 22 mmHg or below\nand included people with IOP above 30 mmHg\nand \u2018required treatment\u2019 without other evidence of\nglaucoma damage, and optic nerve evaluation was\nbased on direct ophthalmoscopy through\nundilated pupils.

Figure 37(a) and (b) show, respectively, \nthe SROC plots for all cut-offs, and a common\ncut-off (for details of the common cut-off selected\nfor NCT see Appendix 13). For all cut-offs,\nsensitivity ranged from 42% (IOP > 26 mmHg,\nfour pulses per eye) to 92% (IOP > 21 mmHg,\nIOP > 22 mmHg, both four pulses per eye), \nwhile specificity ranged from 93% \n(IOP > 21 mmHg, one pulse per eye) to 99.7%\n(IOP > 26 mmHg, four pulses per eye). For the\ncommon cut-off of >21 mmHg, sensitivity was\n92% (95% CrI 62 to 100%), specificity was \n92% (95% CrI 90 to 94%) and the DOR was\n134.88 (95% CrI 17.15 to 1061.10) (Figure 37c\nand d). \nInterpretable results\nIn addition to the study by Vernon and\ncolleagues,164 five population-based studies,\nalthough not providing usable data for NCT in\nterms of test accuracy, otherwise met the review\u2019s\ninclusion criteria and provided information on\ninterpretable results.110,155,161,196,203 The six studies\nreported that 6126 (97.1%) of 6308 participants\nprovided interpretable test results for NCT, while\none prospective cohort study211 involving 105\nparticipants reported that all provided\ninterpretable test results, giving an overall rate of\n97.2% for all studies. One study reported that it\ntook approximately 2 minutes to perform the test\nfor both eyes.164\nSummary\nTable 21 shows the summary performance for each\ntest at the common cut-off. Sensitivity and\nspecificity are derived from the 40 included\nstudies, while the information on interpretable\nresults and time taken to perform the test also\nincludes data, where reported, from other\npopulation-based studies and prospective cohort\nstudies that did not report usable outcomes in\nterms of accuracy, but otherwise met the review\u2019s\ninclusion criteria. Appendix 13 provides details of\nthe sensitivity and specificity for each study, by\ntype of test. \nOnly one study reporting true and false positives\nand negatives for NCT met the inclusion criteria.\nVernon and colleagues164 reported 92% sensitivity\nand also 92% specificity for NCT at a cut-off of\nIOP above 21 mmHg. However, the high\nsensitivity reported was influenced by the fact that\nthe authors\u2019 definition of glaucoma excluded\nnormal tension glaucoma (NTG). The\nperformance estimates should be viewed with\ncaution as the reference standard was suboptimal.\nInterpretable results were provided by 97% of\nthose taking the test, while the time taken to\nperform the test averaged 2 minutes for both \neyes.\nIn many of the tests there was statistical\nheterogeneity across studies. The FDT C-20-1 test\nwas associated with the highest sensitivity (92%)\nand was among the tests with the highest\nspecificity (94%) (ophthalmoscopy 94%; GAT\n95%), as well as being associated with a relatively\nhigh percentage (97%) of interpretable test results\nand short length of time taken to perform the test\n(<1\u20132 minutes per eye).\nHigher quality studies\nEight studies met the criteria for higher quality\nstudies, including six population-based\nstudies155,156,163,166,169,170 and two cohort\nstudies.175,176 Sensitivity analysis was undertaken\nby examining separately the results of the higher\nquality studies, using HSROC analysis where more\nthan one higher quality study reported the same\ntest (Table 22). For both SAP threshold and FDT\nC-20-5, the higher quality studies reported lower\nvalues for both sensitivity and specificity when\ncompared with all studies, while two FDT C-20-5\nstudies not meeting the criteria for higher\nquality173,187 reported very high sensitivity values\n(98% and 100%, respectively). For optic disc\nphotography, compared with all studies, the\nhigher quality studies reported similar sensitivity\n(74% versus 73%), with slightly lower specificity\n(82% versus 89%). For HRT II, compared with all\nstudies, the higher quality studies reported higher\nsensitivity (93% versus 86%) but slightly lower\nspecificity (85% versus 89%). \nStudies reporting combinations of tests\nTwo population-based studies reported the\nsensitivity and specificity of combinations of tests\nfor detecting OAG.163,164 Robin and colleagues163\ncompared the sensitivity and specificity of\nsequential testing with FDT C-20-5 followed by\nHRT II in a population-based study set in\nAustralia involving 261 people. For FDT,\nparticipants with any miss of any severity repeated\nthe test. Three definitions of abnormal HRT II\nwere assessed: one or more borderline or severe\nabnormalities, two or more borderline or one or\nmore severe abnormalities, or three or more\nborderline or one or more severe abnormalities.\nThe definitions were based on MRA, which takes\ninto account the global and sectorial rim area\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n69\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

confidence\nintervals, and \u2018outside normal limits\u2019 if at \nleast one rim area measurement is less than \nthe lower 99.9% confidence interval. The\nreference standard consisted of a full clinical\nophthalmic examination by an ophthalmologist; \na panel of nine glaucoma experts determined \nthe final diagnosis of glaucoma. The \ncombinations of tests reported were: (a) FDT (at\nleast one abnormality) then HRT II (at least one\nabnormality); (b) FDT (at least one abnormality)\nthen HRT II (at least two abnormalities); (c) FDT\n(at least two abnormalities) then HRT II (at \nleast one abnormality); and (d) FDT (at least \ntwo abnormalities) then HRT II (at least two\nabnormalities). The highest sensitivity, 79%, was\nreported for both (a) and (b) with specificities of\n88% and 93%, respectively, while the highest\nspecificity, 95%, was reported for (d) with a\nsensitivity of 74%. \nThe study by Vernon and colleagues164 also\nreported the sensitivity and specificity of\nsequential testing of NCT (Keeler Pulsair)\nfollowed by SAP (Henson CFS 2000 26-point\nsuprathreshold screening programme) for\ndetecting OAG. For NCT, the criterion used to\ndefine a positive result was mean IOP of at least\n22 mmHg. For SAP, a missed point on the \n26-point suprathreshold programme required the\noperator to extend to a 66-point test. A failed test\nwas defined as occurring when sufficient points\nhad been missed to drop the indicator on the\nscreen into the suspicious zone or below. The\nreference standard consisted of all participants\nhaving their optic discs graded by an experienced\nophthalmologist. There was verification bias in\nthat those who tested positive on the index tests\nhad a more extensive evaluation. Glaucoma was\ndefined as IOP greater than 22 mmHg plus\npathologically cupped disc with field loss, or \nIOP greater than 22 mmHg on two occasions in\nassociation with two or more of six pathological\ndisc parameters despite normal fields, or IOP\ngreater than 30 mmHg on two occasions. The\nauthors reported a sensitivity of 92% and\nspecificity of 93% for sequential testing of IOP\nfollowed by the Henson 26-point suprathreshold\nscreening programme. It should be noted,\nhowever, that the reference standard is \nsuboptimal as reported for this study when\nreporting the accuracy of NCT alone in the\nprevious section.\nStudies assessing accuracy for different stages of\nglaucoma\nOne population-based study158 and six\ncase\u2013control studies181,182,184,186,190,191 reported the\naccuracy of tests for detecting glaucoma at\ndifferent stages of the disease. Although some of\nthese studies did not specifically state this as an\naim, they were considered to do so by either\nincluding or excluding people with certain stages\nof glaucoma. While the present review\u2019s inclusion\ncriteria aimed to ensure that study participants\nwould be representative of a screening population,\nsome studies were accepted that excluded very\nsevere loss, for example hemispheric loss, or\nhemianopia or that applied exclusion criteria on\nvision that were not judged as being unduly\nrestrictive. These studies were accepted on the\nbasis that they were in effect providing\ninformation on test accuracy for different stages of\nglaucoma and that the categories of people\nexcluded would generally have already been\ndetected owing to the severity of their vision loss.\nFor example, Katz and colleagues158 excluded\npeople with hemispheric or greater loss, Enger\nand colleagues181 excluded those with advanced\nglaucoma and Harper and colleagues182 excluded\npeople with more advanced glaucomatous visual\nfield defects, while all participants with glaucoma\nin the study by Wood and colleagues191 possessed\nearly\/moderate visual field defects. Ieong and\ncolleagues186 included people with minimal\nglaucomatous field loss, while Wollstein and\ncolleagues190 included those with visual field\ndefects defined as \u2018mild glaucoma\u2019. \nAs these studies aimed to assess test accuracy in\ndifferent stages of glaucoma, their participants\nwere representative of a specific severity rather\nthan a broad spectrum of disease. Table 23\nprovides details of those studies assessing the\naccuracy of tests for different stages of glaucoma,\nthe tests used, the sensitivity and specificity\nreported by the individual studies, and the pooled\nsensitivity and specificity from the meta-analysis\nmodels for all studies reporting the tests (for all\nstages of glaucoma) at the common cut-off (as\nshown in Table 21). \nIn two studies186,190 assessing early-stage glaucoma\nand reporting optic disc photography, HRT II and\nSAP suprathreshold, sensitivity ranged from 69%\n(HRT II) to 72% (SAP suprathreshold), while\nspecificity ranged from 94% (optic disc\nphotography) to 95% (HRT II; SAP\nsuprathreshold). Sensitivity was similar for SAP\nsuprathreshold (72% versus 71%) and optic disc\nphotography (71% versus 73%), but lower for\nScreening and diagnostic tests for open angle glaucoma\n72Health Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n73\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

Overall, optic disc\nphotography performed better than SAP in terms\nof sensitivity but worse in terms of specificity.\nSensitivity for SAP ranged from 50% [three\nadjacent points missed (common cut-off)] to 71%\n(two or more points missed, any location), while\nspecificity ranged from 58% (two or more points\nmissed, any location) to 83% [three adjacent\npoints missed (common cut-off)]. Sensitivity for\noptic disc photography ranged from 73% (rim\narea\/disc area <0.66) to 77% [VCDR > 0.59\n(common cut-off)], while specificity ranged from\n59% [VCDR > 0.59 (common cut-off)] to 62% (rim\narea\/disc area <0.66). In terms of the\nmethodological quality of the study, the spectrum\nof people was seen as representative of those who\nwould attend for screening, there was no evidence\nof partial or differential verification bias, and the\nresults of the index tests were interpreted without\nknowledge of the results of the reference standard\ntest, and vice versa. The reference standard for\nthis study was glaucoma expert opinion based on\nslit-lamp examination, and dilated\nophthalmoscopy to assess the optic disc and nerve\nfibre layer. Therefore, the estimates for the\naccuracy of optic disc photography as the index\ntest may overestimate the accuracy of the test, as\nthe reference standard, although a different test, is\nalso a test of structure.\nSAP compared with HRT II\nTwo studies compared SAP with HRT II, with\nRobin and colleagues163 reporting HRT II as the\nbetter test, and Ieong and colleagues186 reporting\nbroadly similar results for both tests.

The\nSAP test was analysed using the AGIS visual field\ntest scoring method. Three definitions of\nabnormal HRT II were assessed: one or more\nborderline or severe abnormalities, two or more\nborderline or one or more severe abnormalities, or\nthree or more borderline or one or more severe\nabnormalities. The reference standard was a full\nclinical ophthalmic examination and a panel of\nnine glaucoma experts determined the final\ndiagnosis of glaucoma. Overall, HRT II\nperformed better than SAP in terms of both\nsensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity for HRT II\nranged from 90% (at least two borderline or one\nsevere abnormality; at least three borderline or\none severe abnormality) to 95% [at least one\nborderline or one severe abnormality (common\ncut-off)], while specificity ranged from 81% [at\nleast one borderline or one severe abnormality\n(common cut-off)] to 91% (at least three\nborderline or one severe abnormality). Sensitivity\nfor SAP ranged from 63% [AGIS score  3\n(common cut-off)] to 90% (AGIS score  1), while\nspecificity ranged from 58% (AGIS score  1) to\n74% [AGIS score  3 (common cut-off)]. In this\nstudy the spectrum of people was seen as\nrepresentative of those who would attend for\nscreening, there was no evidence of partial or\ndifferential verification bias, and the results of the\nindex tests were interpreted without knowledge of\nthe results of the reference standard test, and vice\nversa. The accuracy of both SAP and HRT II as\nindex tests may have been overestimated as visual\nfield testing and estimates of CDRs also formed\npart of the reference standard.\nIeong and colleagues186 compared SAP\nsuprathreshold (DICON) with HRT II in a\ncase\u2013control study set in the UK involving 29\nparticipants with OAG (including 15 NTG) and 37\nnormal participants, with the tests being carried\nout by eight optometrists. This study aimed to\ntarget those with early-stage glaucoma. OAG\nparticipants with minimal field loss were recruited\nthrough glaucoma clinics at Moorfields Eye\nHospital. Normal participants were spouses or\npartners of those with OAG. The reference\nstandard was glaucoma expert opinion. In terms\nof the criteria used to define a positive result, for\nSAP, decisions on whether visual plots were truly\ndefective were left to the optometrists\u2019 judgement,\nwhile for HRT II if either the global or one of six\nsegments was flagged abnormal the optic disc was\nregarded as suspicious, with borderline\nclassifications taken as normal. The less affected\neye of OAG participants was analysed, while for\nnormal participants the eyes analysed alternated\nright then left in order of presentation. At the\ncommon cut-off, sensitivity for SAP and HRT II\nwas 72% and 69%, respectively, while specificity for\nboth tests was 95%. In terms of quality, the\nspectrum of people was not regarded as\nrepresentative of screening or diagnosis in that\nonly early disease was targeted, there was no\nevidence of partial or differential verification bias,\nand the results of the index tests were interpreted\nwithout knowledge of the results of the reference\nstandard test, and vice versa. The accuracy of both\nSAP and HRT II as index tests may have been\noverestimated, as both visual field testing and\noptic nerve examination formed part of the\nreference standard. \nSAP compared with FDT\nTwo studies compared SAP with FDT, with both\nRobin and colleagues163 and Spry and\ncolleagues176 reporting FDT as better than SAP in\nterms of sensitivity, but worse in terms of\nspecificity. Robin and colleagues163 compared SAP\n(Central 24-2 threshold screening programme of\nthe Humphrey field analyser) with FDT C-20-5 in\na population-based study set in Australia involving\n261 people. The SAP test was analysed using the\nAGIS visual field test scoring method. Four\ndefinitions of abnormal FDT C-20-5 were\nassessed: one abnormal point, two abnormal\npoints, three abnormal points and one abnormal\npoint at moderate or severe level. The reference\nstandard was a full clinical ophthalmic\nexamination and a panel of nine glaucoma experts\ndetermined the final diagnosis of glaucoma.\nOverall, FDT C-20-5 performed better than SAP\nin terms of sensitivity but worse in terms of\nspecificity. Sensitivity for FDT C-20-5 ranged from\n68% (one abnormal point at moderate or severe\nlevel) to 84% [one abnormal point (common cut-\noff)], while specificity ranged from 55% [one\nabnormal point (common cut-off)] to 76% (one\nabnormal point at moderate or severe level).\nSensitivity for SAP ranged from 63% [AGIS score\n 3 (common cut-off)] to 90% (AGIS score  1),\nwhile specificity ranged from 58% (AGIS score  1)\nto 74% [AGIS score  3 (common cut-off)]. In this\nstudy the spectrum of people was seen as\nrepresentative of those who would attend for\nscreening, there was no evidence of partial or\ndifferential verification bias, and the results of the\nindex tests were interpreted without knowledge of\nthe results of the reference standard test, and vice\nversa.

The reference standard\nconsisted of an ophthalmic examination including\nthe SAP threshold test. The definition of an\nabnormal test for both SAP and FDT was a GHT\noutside the normal limit and\/or p < 0.05 with the\npattern standard deviation global index in one or\nboth eyes. At the common cut-off, the study\nreported sensitivity for SAP and FDT of 80% and\n100%, respectively, while specificity was 52% and\n27%, respectively. In terms of the quality of the\nstudy, the spectrum of people was considered\nrepresentative of a diagnostic setting, there was no\nevidence of partial or differential verification bias,\nand the results of the index tests were interpreted\nwithout knowledge of the results of the reference\nstandard. The results of the reference standard\nwere interpreted without knowledge of the FDT\ntest results, but with knowledge of the SAP test\nresults as this test formed part of the reference\nstandard. Sensitivity and specificity may be\noverestimated as both index tests were visual field\ntests, with one (SAP) also forming part of the\nreference standard, resulting in incorporation bias\nfor this test.\nSAP compared with GAT\nTwo studies157,168 compared SAP suprathreshold\nwith GAT, with both reporting that SAP performed\nbetter than GAT in terms of sensitivity but worse\nin terms of specificity. Ivers and colleagues157\ncompared SAP (Humphrey 76-point\nsuprathreshold screening test) with GAT in a\npopulation-based study set in Australia (Blue\nMountains Eye Study) involving 3654 people.\nCriteria for a positive SAP test included one,\nthree, five or ten or more points missing, while\nGAT was assessed at IOP greater than 22 mmHg\nand IOP greater than 28 mmHg. The reference\nstandard for all participants was a detailed eye\nexamination and a screening visual field test.\nGlaucoma suspects received a more thorough\nreference standard consisting of a full threshold\nvisual field test. Sensitivity for SAP ranged from\n37% (ten or more points missing) to 100% (one or\nmore points missing), while specificity ranged\nfrom 50% (one or more points missing) to 92%\n(ten or more points missing). At the common cut-\noff sensitivity and specificity for SAP was 89% and\n73%, respectively. Sensitivity for GAT ranged from\n3% (IOP > 28 mmHg) to 14% [IOP > 22 mmHg\n(common cut-off)], while specificity ranged from\n98% [IOP > 22 mmHg (common cut-off)] to 99%\n(IOP > 28 mmHg). In terms of the quality of the\nstudy, the spectrum of people was seen as\nrepresentative of those who would attend for\nscreening, there was no evidence of partial\nverification bias in that everyone received a\nreference standard test, but there was evidence of\ndifferential verification bias in that only test\npositives on the index tests went on to receive a\nmore thorough reference standard. Although the\nresults of the index tests were interpreted without\nknowledge of the results of the reference standard\ntest, thereby avoiding test review bias, diagnostic\nreview bias may have occurred in that the final\ndiagnosis of glaucoma was made with knowledge\nof the results of the SAP and GAT index tests,\npotentially biasing the assessment of glaucoma\nstatus. The accuracy of both SAP and GAT as\nindex tests may have been overestimated, as visual\nfield testing and IOP measurement formed part of\nthe reference standard, so that it was not wholly\nindependent of the index tests, leading to\nincorporation bias.\nWang and colleagues168 compared SAP\nsuprathreshold (Humphrey full field 120\nscreening programme) with GAT in a population-\nbased study set in the USA involving 510 people.\nThe participants were selected from those\nattending an adult primary care clinic at the Johns\nHopkins Hospital. SAP was assessed at 17 or more\nabsolute or relative defects, while GAT was\nassessed at IOP above 21 mmHg. The reference\nstandard for all participants was a full\nophthalmological examination. Only screen\npositives were referred for a further definite\ndiagnosis of glaucoma. At the common cut-off, the\nstudy reported sensitivity for SAP and GAT of 70%\nand 28%, respectively, while specificity was 67%\nand 96%, respectively. In terms of the quality of\nthe study, the spectrum of people was seen as\nrepresentative of those who would attend for\nscreening, there was no evidence of partial\nverification bias in that all participants received a\nreference standard test, but there was evidence of\ndifferential verification bias in that only test\npositives on the index tests went on to receive a\nmore thorough reference standard. Although the\nresults of the index tests were interpreted without\nknowledge of the results of the reference standard\ntest, avoiding test review bias, it was unclear\nwhether the reference standard test was\ninterpreted without knowledge of the results of the\nindex tests. The accuracy of both SAP and GAT as\nindex tests may have been overestimated, as visual\nfield testing and IOP measurement formed part of\nthe reference standard, so that it was not wholly\nScreening and diagnostic tests for open angle glaucoma\n76independent of the index tests, leading to\nincorporation bias.\nSummary\nTable 25 shows the sensitivity, specificity, DOR and\nrelative RDOR at the common cut-off for the tests\nbeing compared directly within studies. In terms\nof sensitivity, SAP performed better than\nGAT,157,168 broadly similar186 or worse163 than\nHRT II and worse than optic disc photography,166\nFDT C-20-5163 or FDT C-20 matrix.176 In terms of\nspecificity, SAP performed better than optic disc\nphotography,166 FDT C-20-5163 or FDT C-20\nmatrix,176 broadly similar186 or worse than HRT\nII163 and worse than GAT.157,168 DORs for the tests\nranged from 4 for SAP threshold176 to 75 for HRT\nII,163 with higher DORs indicating more\nconvincing diagnostic evidence. \nIn terms of RDORs, compared with SAP, GAT\nperformed better168 or worse,157 HRT II\nperformed better163 or worse,186 FDT C-20-5163\nand FDT C-20 matrix176 performed better, while\noptic disc photography166 showed a broadly\nsimilar performance. The RDORs in the study by\nIvers and colleagues157 were statistically significant\nin favour of SAP suprathreshold over GAT, while\nthose in the study by Robin and colleagues163 were\nstatistically significant in favour of HRT II over\nSAP threshold.\nThe studies by Robin and colleagues,163 Vitale and\ncolleagues166 and Spry and colleagues176 met the\ncriteria specified for higher quality studies.\nHowever, incorporation bias occurred in the study\nby Robin and colleagues163 and Spry and\ncolleagues176 as the SAP test also formed part of\nthe reference standard. There was a possibility of\nincorporation bias in the study by Vitale and\ncolleagues166 as one index test (optic disc\nphotography) and tests that formed part of the\nreference standard (slit-lamp biomicroscopy) were\ntests of structure. \nIndirect comparisons in a single HSROC model\nThe results of the indirect comparison of the ten\ntests are given in Table 26. Out of the large\nnumber of comparisons only four for sensitivity\nand two for specificity showed a statistically\nsignificant difference between tests. There was\nevidence that the sensitivity of FDT C-20-1 was\nhigher than ophthalmoscopy (\u201330, 95% CrI \u201362 to\n\u20130.01) and GAT (45, 95% CrI 17 to 68), and that\nSAP threshold (41, 95% CrI 14 to 64) and HRT II\n(39, 95% CrI 3 to 64) had a higher sensitivity than\nGAT. For specificity, there was evidence of a higher\nlevel for GAT than for FDT C-20-5 (\u201319, 95% CrI\n\u201353 to \u20130.2) and SAP threshold (\u201314, 95% CrI \n\u201337 to \u20131). Several other comparisons were close to\nbeing statistically significant. No one test (or group\nof tests) was clearly more accurate than the others.\nDiscussion of results\nMain findings\nThe included studies reported tests of structure\n(ophthalmoscopy; optic disc photography, RNFL\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n77\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

However, no\nstudies using these tests met the inclusion criteria\nin terms of reporting of test accuracy outcomes.\nDespite the huge volume of literature, no good-\nquality studies were found providing a positive\nresponse to all questions on the modified QUADAS\nchecklist. Eight studies were rated as higher quality\nin that the spectrum of people was considered\nrepresentative of a screening or diagnostic setting,\nand partial and differential verification bias and\ntest and diagnostic review bias were avoided. \nAnalyses were performed at a number of different\nlevels:\n\u25cf HSROC model for each test at all cut-offs and a\ncommon cut-off\n\u25cf HSROC model for tests reported by two or\nmore higher quality studies at a common cut-off\n\u25cf analysis of studies reporting combinations of\ntests\n\u25cf analysis of studies reporting the accuracy of\ntests for stages of glaucoma\n\u25cf analysis of studies directly comparing two or\nmore tests in the same population\n\u25cf indirect comparison of all tests from all\nincluded studies at a common cut-off. \nFrom the available data, the following tests were\nconsidered to be potentially feasible for use in a\nscreening programme for detection of OAG: optic\ndisc photography, HRT II, FDT, SAP and GAT.\nDirect comparison studies provide the most robust\nestimates of comparative test accuracy. Only six\nstudies directly compared two or more of these\ntests, with all studies including SAP as one of the\ntests.157,163,166,168,176,186 In these studies, at the\ncommon cut-off, in terms of sensitivity, SAP\nperformed better than GAT,157,168 broadly\nsimilar186 or worse163 than HRT II and worse than\noptic disc photography,166 FDT C-20-5163 or FDT\nC-20 matrix.176 At the common cut-off, in terms of\nspecificity, SAP performed better than optic disc\nphotography,166 FDT C-20-5163 or FDT C-20\nmatrix,176 broadly similar186 or worse than HRT\nII163 and worse than GAT.157,168 Three direct\ncomparison studies met the criteria for higher\nquality studies.163,166,176\nThe pooled estimate of the sensitivity of the tests\nin detecting OAG ranged from 46% (GAT) to 92%\n(FDT C-20-1), while specificity ranged from 75%\n(FDT C-20-5) to 95% (GAT). The FDT C-20-1 test\nwas associated with the highest sensitivity (92%)\nand was one of the tests associated with the highest\nspecificity (94%), along with ophthalmoscopy (94%)\nand GAT (95%). The pooled estimate for FDT C-\n20-1 showed higher sensitivity and specificity than\nthe pooled estimate for FDT C-20-5 and also the\nsingle FDT C-20 full threshold study. This is\nunexpected (i.e. better sensitivity of C-20-1 than \nC-20-5). These findings were based on only three\nFDT C-20-1 studies, five FDT C-20-5 studies and\none FDT C-20 full threshold study, with\nheterogeneity evident especially in the FDT C-20-5\nstudies. Forest plots showing sensitivity and\nspecificity with 95% confidence intervals revealed\nstatistical heterogeneity across studies for most\ntests, other than for the sensitivity of optic disc\nphotography (number of studies, n = 6), sensitivity\nand specificity of HRT II (n = 3), and sensitivity of\nFDT C-20-1 (n = 3). Empirically, there was no\nobvious single cause for the heterogeneity, but\npotential contributory factors include differences in\npopulations, study design, setting, prevalence and\nseverity of glaucoma within studies. Other factors\ninclude differences in reference standard, and in\ntests included within the same category (e.g.\ndifferent types of perimetry and ophthalmoscopy\nhave a large number of variants, potentially\nleading to heterogeneity in discriminatory power\nacross studies reporting those tests), and the extent\nto which studies were affected by other potential\nbiases (e.g. partial and differential verification bias,\nincorporation bias, test and diagnostic review bias).\nOwing to the imprecision in the estimates from the\npooled meta-analysis models for the diagnostic\nperformance of each test it was not possible to\nidentify a single test (or even a group of tests) as\nthe most accurate. \nBased on the pairwise indirect comparisons, in\nterms of statistically significant differences in test\nperformance, there was evidence that GAT had a\nlower sensitivity than HRT II, SAP threshold and\nFDT C-20-1, but a higher specificity than SAP\nthreshold and FDT C-20-5. FDT C-20-1 also\nseemed to have a better sensitivity than\nophthalmoscopy. Other differences in accuracy\nbetween tests may well exist which could not be\ndetected because of the high level of uncertainty.\nThe wide credible intervals reflected the small\nnumber of studies reporting each test and the\ngenerally high level of heterogeneity. \nPotential biases\nReference standard\nOAG is a clinical diagnosis, based on structural\nabnormalities of the optic disc and an associated\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n79\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

There is no\nuniversally agreed optimal reference standard for\nthe diagnosis of OAG, although progressive\nstructural optic neuropathy has been proposed as\nthe best possible reference standard.148,236\nVariations in the reference standard used to define\nOAG directly affect the estimates of test\naccuracy.237,238 In addition, the different tests\nbecome abnormal at different stages of the disease\nand at a single time-point agreement between tests\nis likely to be poor owing to these differences.\nIn this review either of two reference standard\ntests was considered. The primary reference\nstandard was confirmed OAG on follow-up and\nwas considered to be the best reference standard\nalthough, as anticipated, few studies used it.\nTherefore, another reference standard, cross-\nsectional ophthalmologist-diagnosed OAG, was\nalso considered. The diagnosis from this second\nreference standard could be based on assessment\nof the visual field and\/or the optic disc without\nrequiring follow-up confirmation. Of the 40\nstudies included in this review, seven used a\nreference standard of follow-up confirmation of\nglaucoma.22,106,166,171,174,178,189 However, there was\nno obvious pattern in terms of the sensitivity and\nspecificity of the tests reported by studies using a\nreference standard of follow-up confirmation of\nglaucoma compared with those studies using a\nreference standard of ophthalmologist-diagnosed\nglaucoma. \nSeverity of the disease\nThe majority of the studies did not stratify test\naccuracy on the basis of disease severity. In\ngeneral, tests become more sensitive as the disease\nbecomes more severe. Hence, a study including\nparticipants with advanced disease should report\nbetter sensitivity. However, unless the distribution\nof disease severity in the examined population is\nexplicitly reported in primary studies, it is not\npossible to evaluate the impact of any spectrum\nbias that might have occurred. In addition, if an\nadequate sample size for subgroups is not\nachieved, within-study comparisons of test\nperformance may result in a loss of power to\ndetect significant differences.239 Seven studies\nreporting test accuracy in different stages of\nglaucoma were included in this\nreview.158,181,182,184,186,190,191 However, no\nconsistent pattern of sensitivities and specificities\nfor different stages of glaucoma emerged from the\nstudies. One reason for this was that the studies\nmostly reported different tests. Of those reporting\nthe same tests for different stages of glaucoma,\nIeong and colleagues186 reported a sensitivity of\n72% for SAP suprathreshold for early-stage\nglaucoma, while Enger and Sommer181 and Katz\nand colleagues158 both reported a sensitivity of\n97% for early\/moderate-stage glaucoma. It is not\nunexpected that a visual field test such as SAP\nwould increase in sensitivity as the disease\nprogresses. Variations in the results between other\nstudies can be explained by the use of non-\nuniform and non-standardised definitions for\nvarious stages of glaucoma. Some studies used\nstructural damage to define these stages (early,\nmoderate, severe), while others used functional\ndamage. However, it could be argued that once\nfunctional damage is detectable on standard\nperimetry, then by definition the disease has\nprogressed beyond early stage.229,240,241\nIncorporation bias\nIn glaucoma diagnosis the concept of incorporation\nbias is complex. For example, it has been\nsuggested that inclusion of any optic disc criteria\nin the reference standard when evaluating another\noptic disc test (e.g. HRT) introduces incorporation\nbias.242 In such studies it may seem logical to use\nonly visual field examination as a reference\nstandard test. This, however, assumes that\nstructural (e.g. optic disc) and functional (e.g.\nvisual field) damage occur simultaneously in\nglaucoma pathogenesis, whereas there is evidence\nthat disc damage precedes manifest visual field\nloss.229,240,241 Up to 30% of optic nerve fibre\ndamage occurs before visual field damage becomes\ndetectable. Hence, using visual field assessment\nalone as a reference standard may report an\nunfairly low accuracy of an imaging test, especially\nif more people with early glaucoma are included\nin the study. For example, if visual field damage\nalone is used as a reference standard and a study is\nconducted at time-point A (Figure 38) to evaluate\nan imaging test, it will report many false positives,\nas detectable visual field damage has not yet\noccurred. However, if a similar study is performed\nat time-point B, there will be greater agreement\nbetween reference standard and index test and\nhence the test accuracy will be much higher.\nHospital-based studies (including case\u2013control\nstudies)\nTwenty of the 40 studies included in this review\nwere hospital based. A hospital population is, by\nnature, an enriched population and the\nprevalence of the disease will be higher than that\nin the community. This population may also\ninclude a disproportionate number of patients\nwith high IOP and a disproportionately small\nnumber of patients with small optic discs,\npotentially leading to overoptimistic performance\nScreening and diagnostic tests for open angle glaucoma\n80estimates. In addition, hospital-based studies\ngenerally recruit participants from glaucoma\nclinics who have previous experience of tests and\ntherefore these studies cannot account for the\nlearning effect in those unfamiliar with such tests,\nunlike the case in a screening situation.243\u2013246\nHowever, only hospital-based studies whose\nparticipants were considered to be representative\nof those referred from primary care were included\nin the review. \nDiagnostic case\u2013control studies are useful at the\ninitial stages of validating a test. To test the\napplicability of a new test it should be applied\ndirectly to the population of its intended use.\nCase\u2013control studies recruit participants with a\nclear disease status, that is, either with or without\nthe target disease. Indeterminate and\nintermediate results are common, and often\ncoexisting disease produces a positive test result.\nThe majority of the case\u2013control studies identified\napplied stringent criteria for inclusion such as\nvisual acuity of 6\/9, or no other ocular disease.\nRutjes and colleagues247 evaluated various\npotential sources of bias in diagnostic studies. The\nfactor with the highest impact on estimates of test\naccuracy was a case\u2013control study design with\nseverely diseased cases and healthy controls. Fifty-\nseven case\u2013control studies where the participants\nwere considered unrepresentative of a case-mix\nfound in a general population where OAG\nscreening would be carried out were excluded\nfrom the review (see Appendix 10). \nPrevalence of the disease\nThe accuracy of a test may vary according to the\npopulation in which it is performed. Although\nabsolute sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic\ntest are independent of the prevalence of a\ndisease, a diverse spectrum of the disease is\nencountered in different prevalence levels. With\nincreasing prevalence more cases of moderate to\nsevere disease are expected, and since it is easier\nto differentiate between severely diseased and\nnon-diseased people, a test would be expected to\nreport improved (apparent) sensitivity and\nspecificity. Therefore, studies with a significantly\nhigher prevalence than the UK estimates should\nbe interpreted with this limitation in\nmind.156,161\u2013163,168,170 These studies tended to\nrecruit their participants through media\nadvertising rather than contacting individuals in a\npredefined population. These studies, including\ntwo that met the criteria for higher quality\nstudies,163,170 may be considered to be more\nrepresentative of screening in higher risk\npopulations.\nHigher quality studies\nOnly eight studies met the criteria specified for\nhigher quality studies, of which six were\npopulation based155,156,163,166,169,170 and two were\ncohort studies.175,176 For FDT C-20-5 and SAP\nthreshold, the higher quality studies reported\nlower values for both sensitivity and specificity\ncompared with all studies, while two studies not\nmeeting the criteria for higher quality173,187\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n81\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

For HRT II,\ncompared with all studies, the higher quality\nstudies reported higher sensitivity but slightly\nlower specificity. \nIssues relevant to screening\nUptake and time taken to perform the test\nIn addition to the sensitivity and specificity of the\ntest(s), other factors may impact on the success of\na screening programme, including the percentage\nof people invited who attend for screening\n(uptake), the percentage of those taking part who\nprovide interpretable test results and the time\ntaken to perform the test. Uptake levels ranged\nfrom 28.3163 to 99.5%,154 with a median rate\nacross studies of 82.8%. The difference may be\nexplained at least in part by differences in the way\nin which the studies made their targeted audience\naware of the screening programme. For example,\nRobin and colleagues163 advertised their\nprogramme through the media, while other\nstudies with greater uptake adopted a more\nproactive approach in identifying their target\npopulation and inviting them to attend for\nscreening.21,99 The percentage of participants\nproviding interpretable test results ranged from\n79.5% for RNFL photography to 99.1% for GAT,\nwith ophthalmoscopy (97.8%), OKP (96.9%), SAP\nthreshold (98.9%), FDT C-20-1 (96.7%) and NCT\n(97.2%) all reporting rates of interpretable test\nresults greater than 95%. \nFew included studies gave details of the time taken\nto perform the test (see Table 21). None of the\nincluded studies of ophthalmoscopy, RNFL\nphotography, HRT II or GAT reported the time\ntaken to perform the test. One study reported this\ninformation for optic disc photography,197 three\nfor OKP,154,170,212 four for SAP\nsuprathreshold,159,162,164,174 four for SAP\nthreshold, all of which used SITA standard or\nSITA fast,176,195,198,206 four for FDT \nC-20-1,170,185,187,214 two for FDT C-20-5155,187 and\none for NCT.164 The information provided on\ntime taken to perform the test should be\ninterpreted with this limitation in mind.\nWhat stage of glaucoma should be targeted for\nscreening?\nIt is important to determine the severity of\nglaucoma that screening should detect. This is\nimportant as tests that perform better in moderate\nto severe disease but have low diagnostic yield in\nearly glaucoma could have an overall superior\ndiagnostic utility as screening tests. Identifying\nlarge numbers of people with early disease that\nmay never progress to significant visual\nimpairment or reduction in quality of life may\nresult in greater harm than benefit from\nscreening.\nDamage caused by OAG typically occurs slowly\nand over a long period. Many people diagnosed\nwith glaucoma will never develop a significant\nvisual impairment during their lifetime. Current\ncase detection identifies only around half the\nnumber of people with OAG and thus prevents\nonly a limited number from progressing to\nsignificant visual impairment. Introducing OAG\nscreening with a test that is sensitive for moderate\ndisease will prevent significant visual impairment\nin an additional number of people but will still\nmiss some cases. Using a highly sensitive test for\nOAG will identify all those who are at risk of\ndeveloping significant visual field loss and\nblindness; however, it will also identify a large\nproportion of people who are not at risk of\ndeveloping severe glaucoma during their lifetime.\nTreating these otherwise asymptomatic individuals\ncould result in the unnecessary use of limited\nhealthcare resources. In addition, labelling\nasymptomatic individuals as \u2018diseased\u2019 may well\ncause unnecessary anxiety.\nMost of the visual disability in glaucoma is related\nto visual field loss. Therefore, it is reasonable to\ntarget glaucoma with early visual field loss (i.e.\nperimetric glaucoma) in OAG screening. It is\nworth noting that this does not rule out structural\ntests from glaucoma screening. A structural test\nsuch as HRT may have a better diagnostic\nperformance than a functional test such as SAP in\nthe perimetric stage of glaucoma because, in this\nstage, the disc damage would have progressed\nbeyond early stage and would therefore be easier\nto detect.\nStrengths and limitations of the review\nThe field of systematic reviews of diagnostic tests\nis a nascent one and the methodology for these\ncomplex reviews is currently still evolving. \nBearing these limitations in mind, this review is\none of the largest systematic reviews of screening\nand diagnostic tests in glaucoma. Several \nlevels of analyses were undertaken, including\nHSROC analysis on all studies and higher quality\nstudies, analysis of studies reporting combinations\nof tests, studies reporting accuracy of tests for\ndetecting stages of glaucoma and studies directly\ncomparing two or more tests. In addition, all the\ntests were modelled simultaneously (in one model)\nScreening and diagnostic tests for open angle glaucoma\n82using a Bayesian approach. This allowed direct\nestimates of differences in sensitivities and\nspecificities to be calculated. To be included,\nstudies had to meet specific inclusion criteria. The\nvalidity of indirect comparisons does depend on\nassumptions regarding the characteristics of the\nincluded studies; however, the indirect method is\nformally performing the comparison that users of\nthe report are likely to make when assessing the\npooled results for the individual tests. As such, this\nmethod of indirect comparisons serves an\nimportant purpose and reaffirms the lack of\ncertainty about which test is indeed the best. \nIn terms of limitations, relatively few studies were\nidentified for each test and it was not possible to\nperform sensitivity analysis based on study design.\nOwing to the small number of studies for each\ntest, different study designs (population-based\nstudies and studies including an already suspect\npopulation) were pooled together in the HSROC\nmeta-analysis models. Only six of the 40 studies\ndirectly compared two or more of the tests that\nwere considered to be potentially feasible for use\nin a screening programme. There were too few\nstudies on the individual tests for the indirect\ncomparison to identify what was the best test. Only\neight studies met the criteria for higher quality\nstudies. The studies were lacking in evidence of\ntest accuracy in high-risk groups and those most\nlikely to be targeted for OAG screening. There is a\nlack of a generally agreed reference standard test\nfor OAG against which other tests can be\nevaluated. Studies not providing sufficient\ninformation to allow the calculation of 2 \u00d7 2 tables\nwere excluded, although they may have\ncontributed information in terms of sensitivity and\nspecificity. Case\u2013control studies where the\nparticipants were not considered representative of\na screening population were also excluded, even if\nthe same inclusion and exclusion criteria were\napplied to both cases and controls, although they\nmay have contributed information on test accuracy\nin a clinic situation.\nConclusions\nImplications for practice\nFor a low-prevalence disease a screening test needs\nto be highly specific. In the meta-analysis models\nthe following tests provided a specificity of 85% or\nhigher: ophthalmoscopy (94%), optic disc\nphotography (89%), RNFL photography (88%),\nHRT II (89%), FDT C-20-1 (94%), OKP (90%),\nSAP suprathreshold (85%) and GAT (95%). In this\nreview the FDT C-20-1 test was associated with the\nhighest combination of sensitivity and specificity\nfor detecting OAG. As pointed out earlier, there\nwas a wide variation in the reference standards\namong included studies. Variations in the reference\nstandards may partly account for varied diagnostic\naccuracies: a stricter reference standard within a\nstudy will lead to a higher specificity and vice versa.\nHowever, owing to the strongly heterogeneous\nnature of the data overall and the relatively small\nnumber of studies, it was not possible to conclude\nwith certainty whether any one test was definitely\nsuperior in terms of accuracy. \nImplications for future research\nFuture research should focus on a consensus OAG\ndefinition and reference standard. As a significant\nproportion of visual morbidity in glaucoma is\ndirectly related to visual field loss, a definition\nwith emphasis on visual field damage may be\nmore appropriate. The possibility of a consensus\nreference standard test should also be explored.\nThe definition of different severities of glaucoma\nis important, and the stage of glaucoma that is\nimportant to be detected by screening should be\nagreed. There is a need for high-quality primary\nstudies comparing candidate screening tests in an\nappropriate population.\nThe accuracy of the various screening tests should\nbe evaluated in a sufficiently large population-\nbased study. Initially, a cross-sectional study to\nevaluate the relative accuracies of comparator tests\nwould be preferable. The main advantage of a\ncross-sectional study is a quick outcome. A\ndiagnostic cross-sectional study could be an RCT\nwhere patients are randomised to one or the other\ntest(s), or it may be a paired study where each\npatient receives both (several\/all) tests. The\nadvantage of a paired study is that a smaller\nsample size is required. However, for logistical\nreasons, it may not be practical for every\nparticipant to receive all tests. The study should\nhave a predetermined sample size for assessment\nof test accuracies in high-risk subgroups and for\npopulations in whom glaucoma screening is\nthought to be cost-effective. Different combination\nalgorithms combining structural and functional\ntests need further exploration. In this review the\ncommon cut-off chosen for each test was the one\nmost frequently reported by the studies, which\nmay not necessarily be the most appropriate. For\nexample, IOP testing was considered an integral\npart of a screening strategy, but studies generally\nreported data only for a cut-off of above\n21 mmHg, although also providing data for other,\nadditional, cut-offs would have been more\ninformative.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n83\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

A summary is\nprovided in this section.\nThe aim of this review was to determine the\nimpact of screening, in terms of benefits and\nharms, compared with opportunistic case finding.\nEffectiveness of screening can be assessed by the\nprevalence of and degree of optic nerve damage\ndue to OAG in screened and unscreened\npopulations, assuming that successful detection\nand subsequent treatment of OAG lead to lower\nprevalence of advanced optic nerve damage in\nscreened versus unscreened populations.\nMethods\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nRCTs of screening versus no screening for \nOAG were eligible for inclusion. The reference\nstrategy of no screening included case finding;\nthat is, opportunistic detection. Trials comparing\ndifferent screening strategies were not included.\nAny method of randomisation was considered,\nincluding that in which individuals, locations or\npractices were randomised, and differences in\nstudy quality were taken into account in the\nanalysis. Ideally, trials should have analysed data\non an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. It was\nplanned to include other types of analysis\nprovided all randomised patients were \naccounted for and to use an available case-based\nanalysis.\nTypes of participant\nStudies from any population were considered, but\nmajor differences in the populations studied such\nas age at screen and race would be reported when\nanalysing the results. People already known to\nhave glaucoma or already under the care of an eye\nspecialist, or known to be visually impaired for\nother reasons were not expected to be included in\nroutine screening. Screening is likely to detect\nother degenerative eye conditions and other forms\nof glaucoma, although these were not included as\nthe primary outcome of the review.\nTypes of intervention\nStudies of any screening modality for OAG were\neligible. \nTypes of outcome measure\nPrimary outcomes\nAny or all of the following three primary outcomes\nwere considered for this review:\n\u25cf Prevalence of any degree of characteristic visual\nfield loss in screened and non-screened\npopulations as diagnosed by any method of\nvisual field assessment (excluding\nconfrontation). The proportion of people with a\npredetermined severity of field loss (attributable\nto glaucoma) was to be compared in the\nscreened and unscreened populations.\n\u25cf Prevalence of optic nerve damage in screened\nand non-screened populations as diagnosed \nby any method of imaging. The difference in\nthe prevalence of a prespecified degree of\nstructural optic nerve damage would have been\nexamined in screened and unscreened\npopulations.\n\u25cf Prevalence of visual impairment in screened\nand non-screened populations as defined by\nnumber of subjects certified or registered\naccording to national or regional standards\n(where the study was conducted) as:\n\u2013 blind \n\u2013 partially sighted\n\u2013 vision below standard for driving. \nSecondary outcomes\nScreening may lead to more treatment and\nsubsequently a lower mean IOP in screened than\nin unscreened populations. IOP is a surrogate\noutcome but, nevertheless, indirect evidence of\neffectiveness of screening might be derived from\nthe reduction in the severity of the most well-\nestablished and modifiable risk factor. Reporting\nof any differences in mean IOP in screened and\nunscreened populations was planned.\nAdverse effects\nFalse negatives are people with glaucoma who \npass screening and go on to lose vision.

Referral causes excess burden on health\nservices and unnecessary inconvenience and\nanxiety for the patient.\nQuality of life measures\nReporting of any measures of quality of life or\nhealth status attributable to the screening or OAG\nwas planned.\nEconomic data\nReporting of any economic data on the costs and\ncost-effectiveness of programme implementation,\ncost per case identified or other costs relating to\nthe screening programme was planned. \nOther outcomes\nThe technical differences between the screening\nand control interventions, the quality of the\nintervention including any quality control\nmeasures, rates of participation, contamination\nand follow-up were measured among screening\nand control arms.\nFollow-up\nA minimum follow-up of 1 year postscreening was\nrequired for all studies.\nSearch strategy for identification of studies\nAny RCTs evaluating population-based screening\nprogrammes for OAG with a minimum 1-year\nfollow-up were included. \nElectronic searches\nThe searches outlined in Chapter 4 were used;\nhowever, for this review no language or date\nrestrictions were applied, according to Cochrane\nmethodology. No manual searches were\nundertaken for this review.\nResults\nThe search generated 1191 records of studies\nrelevant to the search criteria, but none was an\nRCT of screening and hence no data extraction or\nanalysis was conducted.\nDiscussion\nNo RCTS were identified, the applied search\nstrategy (detailed in Appendix 2) was\ncomprehensive, with in this case no language\nrestrictions, and as such it is very unlikely to have\nmissed any existing trials. Two major sources of\nbias that will otherwise distort the findings of\nobservational studies can only be dealt with by\nrandomised trials of screening.\nLead-time bias occurs when the condition is\ndetected at an earlier stage through screening,\nalthough no influence on ultimate outcome is\nachieved as a result of that earlier detection. The\nsurvival is apparently greater because the\ncondition is known about for longer, but an\notherwise similar unscreened individual goes blind\nat the same rate, although spending less time\nbeing aware of the problem. In such a\ncircumstance, it is fair to conclude that screening\nhas done harm.\nLength bias occurs because interval screening is\nmore likely to detect slowly progressive and\nindolent disease than aggressive, rapidly\nprogressing glaucoma. Apparently, screening has\nled to more people with early-stage disease being\nidentified who are at much lower risk of blindness.\nThis apparent benefit may actually be harmful if\nthe risk of the adverse effects of disease in these\nmild cases is very low, and the number of people\nwith aggressive, blinding glaucoma may remain\nthe same and the blindness rates unchanged.\nHence, this review specifically searched for RCTs of\nscreening in that it is the only study design that can\nadequately deal with these two sources of bias.\nHowever, the organisation and conduct of such\nstudies is demanding and long-term follow-up is\nrequired on large numbers of people if there is to\nbe any likelihood of detecting an effect. It is\nperhaps not surprising that no such trials were\nidentified. Justification for such a study will depend\non refinement of screening test strategies and\neconomic modelling of potential benefit and cost.\nConclusions\nEffectiveness of screening for OAG can only be\nestablished by high-quality randomised trials.\nSome preliminary issues need to be dealt with\nbefore such trials can be undertaken. A better\nunderstanding of testing technologies is needed\nand high-quality studies in different populations\nare required to delineate optimum screening\nstrategies in terms of individuals, tests,\ncombinations of tests and test frequency. It is\nrecognised that 1-year follow-up, included as a\nminimum in this review, is extremely short in the\ncourse of glaucoma. Ideally, much longer follow-\nup is required; however, surrogate outcomes such\nas IOP at 1 year can be indicators of prognosis.\nModelling alongside a trial can be used to predict\nlong-term costs and benefits. Better monitoring of\nhealth outcomes in large populations using\nregisters of blindness by cause can provide\nsurveillance for the observation of the impact of\nprevention strategies over time.\nEvidence of effectiveness\n86Effectiveness of glaucoma\ntreatment\nIntroduction\nTreatment aims to prevent visual disability and\npreserve overall wellbeing for patients with\nglaucoma. The visual loss in glaucoma is due to\nthe death of retinal ganglion cells. Vascular and\/or\nmechanical factors at the optic nerve head may\nprecipitate cell death and IOP may be implicated\nin either or both of these mechanisms.249\nCurrently, IOP is the only risk factor that can be\ntreated.\nMedical treatment, to lower IOP, is administered\ntopically as eye drops. These treatments are\ncommonly topical  -blockers, and more recently\nnewer topical agents including carbonic anhydrase\ninhibitors,  2-agonists and prostaglandin\nanalogues have been introduced.  -Blockers and\nprostaglandin analogues are the most commonly\nused medications. Reduced rates of surgery for\nglaucoma are felt to be a consequence of the\nintroduction of these new eye drops.250 An\nalternative or additive treatment to the use of\nmedications is laser trabeculoplasty with discrete\nlaser ablation to the trabecular meshwork of the\ndrainage angle. The effectiveness of alternative\nmedical interventions for OAG and of laser\ntrabeculoplasty is being assessed in two Cochrane\nreviews that are currently in progress.30,31\nGlaucoma drainage surgery aims to lower the IOP\nby creating an alternative route for aqueous\nhumour outflow. Trabeculectomy is the most\ncommon glaucoma surgical procedure. In a\nCochrane review of medical versus surgical\ninterventions for OAG, evidence from one trial\nsuggests, for mild OAG, that visual field\ndeterioration up to 5 years is not significantly\ndifferent whether treatment is initiated with\nmedication or trabeculectomy. There was no\nevidence to determine the effectiveness of\ncontemporary medication (prostaglandin\nanalogues,  2-agonists and topical carbonic\nanhydrase inhibitors) compared with surgery in\nsevere OAG.29\nThe aim of this part of the project was to\nundertake a systematic review to determine the\neffectiveness of any IOP-lowering treatment\n(medical, laser or surgery or any combination\nthereof), compared with no treatment in\npreventing glaucoma progression in terms of\nreduced visual field loss and progressive optic\nnerve damage (a surrogate outcome for visual\nfield loss), and on patient-reported health status.\nMethods\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nSystematic reviews and RCTs of treatment versus\nno treatment for participants with OAG were\nincluded. Studies where the participants had\nocular hypertension (i.e. raised IOP but no\nevidence of glaucoma damage) were excluded.\nData extraction\nOne reviewer screened the titles and abstracts of\nthe identified reports.\nQuality assessment\nA previously validated ten-item checklist\ndeveloped by Oxman was used to assess the\nmethodological quality of systematic reviews\nmeeting the inclusion criteria.251,252 The checklist\ncontains nine criteria, scored as \u2018Yes\u2019, \u2018Partially\u2019 or\n\u2018No\u2019, depending on the extent to which they are\nmet. The checklist also provides one summary\ncriterion for overall scientific quality, scored on a\nseven-point scale, where 1 indicates \u2018extensive\nflaws\u2019 and 7 indicates \u2018minimal flaws\u2019.\nResults\nNumber and type of studies included\nIn total, 323 reports were identified, and 15 full-\ntext papers were selected for assessment. One\nsystematic review of RCTs of treatment versus no\ntreatment for ocular hypertension and OAG was\nidentified.19 No further RCTs of treatment\neffectiveness for OAG: other than those included\nin the systematic review and also separately\nidentified by the search strategy, were identified.\nOne additional RCT253 was identified where\nparticipants had ocular hypertension, but this did\nnot meet the inclusion criteria of this specific\nreview and was excluded.\nCharacteristics of included study \nThe systematic review by Maier and colleagues19\nincluded seven studies; however, five of these\nrelated to the treatment of ocular hypertension\nand therefore are not relevant to this review. Thus,\nthis review reports the results of the two included\ntrials of treatment versus no treatment for\nparticipants with OAG: the Early Manifest\nGlaucoma Trial (EMGT),27 where participants had\nbeen identified as having manifest OAG with or\nwithout raised IOP, and the Collaborative Normal\nTension Glaucoma Study (CNTGS),254 where\nparticipants had OAG but the IOP had not been\nrecorded as over 24 mmHg in either eye. \nThe CNTGS was a 5-year study in the 1990s across\n24 centres in the USA, Canada, The Netherlands\nand Finland. One eye of 145 participants with\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n87\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.progressive NTG was randomised to treatment or\nno treatment. In the treatment arm, treatment\ncould be medical or surgical and aimed for a 30%\nreduction in IOP. The end-point of the study was\ndocumented progression either in terms of visual\nfield or optic disc changes compatible with\nprogression. The rate of development of cataracts\nin the untreated participants was significantly\nlower than in the surgically treated group. In a\nsurvival analysis there was no significant difference\nin the risk of progression between the two groups;\nhowever, after censoring for cataract development\nthe treated group had a significantly lower risk of\nprogression. The mean survival time to\nprogression in the treated arm was 6 years, and\n5 years in the no-treatment arm.\nThe EMGT had a different spectrum of\nparticipants from CNTGS, recruiting newly\ndetected OAG cases identified from a population-\nscreening programme with 255 participants\nrandomised to treatment or no treatment.\nParticipants with very high IOPs (mean IOP \n>30 mmHg) were excluded. All eyes randomised\nto treatment received a full 360-degree\ntrabeculoplasty plus a selective  -blocker eye drop\n(Betaxalol). Additional therapy was added if the\nIOP exceeded 25 mmHg on two consecutive\noccasions. At the final analysis (median follow-up\nof 6 years), 78 (62%) of the 126 control eyes versus\n58 (45%) of the 129 treated eyes progressed (log-\nrank p = 0.007). The median time to progression\nwas 5.5 years in the treated patients and 4 years in\nthe no-treatment group. More patients in the\ntreatment arm developed cataract than in the \nno-treatment group (p = 0.004). Health-related\nquality of life (HRQoL) was measured using a\nSwedish translation of the 25-item National Eye\nInstitute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-\n25), but was not measured at baseline, as the\nquestionnaire was not available at that time. There\nwas no significant difference in composite scores\nbetween the treated and untreated group at 6-year\nfollow-up. The results of this study therefore\nsuggest that treatment, whether by randomisation\nor received during follow-up, was not related to\nvision-targeted HRQoL. However, the analysis of\nthe HRQoL data was not an ITT analysis.\nQuality assessment\nThe systematic review was assessed as having only\nminor flaws, in that the criteria used to assess the\nmethodological quality of the included trials were\nnot stated, the search strategy was deemed to be\nreasonably comprehensive in that there were no\nlanguage restrictions, reference lists were searched\nand authors were contacted for further details if\nrequired, but there was no handsearching (see\nAppendix 14 for the detailed results of the quality\nassessment of the systematic review). As the\nsystematic review had not assessed the\nmethodological quality of the included trials, the\nquality of the two included RCTs was assessed\naccording to criteria developed by the Cochrane\nCollaboration Eyes and Vision Group. These\ncriteria assess quality in terms of likelihood of\nselection, performance, detection and attrition\nbias. In CNTGS it was unclear whether allocation\nwas adequately concealed, participants and\nclinicians were not masked to treatment\nassignment, the person assessing outcomes was\nunaware of the assigned treatment, it was unclear\nwhether follow-up rates were similar in\ncomparison groups, and the analysis was ITT.\nThus, this study can be considered as potentially\nprone to selection, performance and possibly\nattrition bias. EMGT was graded as low risk of bias\nfor selection, detection and attrition bias (except\nfor the HRQoL outcome), but there was a\npossibility of performance bias in that clinicians\nand participants were not masked to treatment\nallocation. The nature of the study was such that\nclinicians needed to be aware of treatment\nallocation to decide on clinical management\nduring the study. \nAssessment of effectiveness\nThe analysis by Maier and colleagues19 combined\nthe results of these two studies using a DeSimonian\nand Laird random effects model and showed a\nsignificant pooled treatment effect of lowering\nIOP to prevent glaucoma progression (hazard\nratio 0.65, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.87, p = 0.003). There\nwas no significant statistical heterogeneity between\nthe studies ( 2 = 0.13, p = 0.72).\nDiscussion\nIn both studies the definition of glaucoma\nprogression was based on either or both of\nprogressive glaucomomatous optic disc changes or\nprogressive visual field loss and progression was\ndetermined by a reading committee masked to the\nintervention. The criteria defining progression of\nvisual field loss and optic disc changes differed\nbetween studies but in both studies there was a\nstrict definition of progression, visual field\nassessment was on automated perimetry and in\nboth studies visual field loss had to be confirmed\non repeat testing. In both studies, of those\nparticipants progressing, the majority were based\non progressive visual field loss with all bar one\nparticipant in the EMGT, and three participants in\nthe CNTGS, progressing on optic disc criteria\nalone.\nEvidence of effectiveness\n88The results suggest a beneficial treatment effect;\nhowever, neither study was graded as high quality\non all criteria, and as such the effects may be\nsubject to bias, and the results should be\ninterpreted with this in mind.\nConclusions \nEvidence from the included, good-quality,\nsystematic review suggests that treatment is\neffective at slowing the rate of progression of\nOAG. It is less certain as to how this translates into\nthe effectiveness of treatment on reducing long-\nterm visual impairment and maintaining quality \nof life. \nProbability of glaucoma\ndeterioration from mild disease to\nvisual impairment\nIntroduction\nAs described in the previous section, OAG is\ntypically a slowly progressive disease. The purpose\nof this section is not systematically to describe all\nissues and studies that have investigated\nprogression per se, but to describe specifically for\nthe purposes of the economic modelling the\napproximate probability of progressing from mild\ndisease to visual impairment. OAG was defined\nusing a visual field glaucoma staging system that\nhad four stages: mild, moderate, severe and\nvisually impaired (partial sight and blind). The\ndetails are described below. Progression was\nassumed to follow a linear course, implying that a\nnewly diagnosed glaucoma patient would start\nwith mild disease and progress through every\nstage until visually impaired. \nThe aim of this component of the study was to\nestimate the yearly probability of progressing from\nmild to moderate, moderate to severe and severe\nto visually impaired.\nGrading of disease severity\nThere is no accepted scale of glaucoma severity.\nAutomated threshold perimetry is a widely\naccepted method of assessing uniocular glaucoma\nseverity and for monitoring progression in each\neye, but there is no standardised definition of\nseverity and progression on automated perimetry.\nThere is also limited evidence on the correlation\nbetween the severity of visual field loss and\npatient-reported visual disability and quality \nof life. \nRCTs for OAG27,255,256 each developed different\nscoring systems for defining severity and\nprogression. These scoring systems were event\nbased, in that progression was confirmed when a\npreset threshold was exceeded. When each of\nthese scales was applied to the same cohort of\npatients the rates of apparent progression varied\naccording to which scoring scale and definition of\nprogression were used.257,258\nA modified version of the glaucoma severity scale\nused by a study group examining the costs of\nglaucoma treatment by stage in Europe and the\nUSA was used for this study259,260 (Table 27). This\nscale itself was a modification of the\nHodapp\u2013Anderson\u2013Parrish scale.261 For the\npurposes of this study a commonly reported\nmeasure of the depth of the glaucomatous visual\nfield defect was used; this was the mean defect or\nmean deviation (MD) on standard automated\nperimetry. The MD refers to the average deviation\nin decibels (dB) of the measured threshold values\nfrom the age-corrected normal value. One\nproblem with using the MD alone to classify\nseverity is that other non-glaucomatous disease,\nmainly the presence of cataract, affects the MD.\nOther glaucoma severity scales are based on the\nMD, but also take into account other\ncharacteristics of visual field loss such as the\nlocation and clustering of the defect, the pattern\ndeviation and the corrected pattern standard\ndeviation to categorise the extent of the focal loss\nof visual field (i.e. correcting for diffuse loss that\nmay be caused by the presence of cataract). After\npreliminary searching of the literature, it became\nclear that the pattern deviation and the corrected\npattern standard deviation could not be\nincorporated into the severity scale used, since\nstudies rarely reported these items in detail. \nMethods\nTo estimate the rate of glaucoma progression, a\nstudy would require a random sample of people\nwith glaucoma, and who have not been treated.\nThis sample would be prospectively followed up\nwithout treatment for many years and visual field\ntested at regular intervals. Recognising that such\nan approach is ethically and practically difficult, it\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n89\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

For approach\n2, the study should have categorised progression\nin terms of the grading system used in this study\n(or provided enough information to be\ncategorised into the grading system).\nTarget condition\nThe target condition was OAG (mild, moderate or\nsevere).\nParticipants\nPeople over 40 years of age were included.\nOutcomes\nStudies reporting relevant and interpretable data\non the following outcomes were considered:\n\u25cf average MD in decibels at study entry\n\u25cf average MD in decibels at follow-up\n\u25cf average yearly MD reduction\n\u25cf probability of progressing from mild to\nmoderate disease\n\u25cf probability of progressing from moderate to\nsevere disease\n\u25cf probability of progressing from severe disease to\nvisual impairment\n\u25cf probability of progressing to unilateral\nblindness.\nData extraction strategy\nTwo reviewers screened the titles (and abstracts if\navailable) of all reports identified by the search\nstrategy. Full-text copies of all studies deemed to\nbe potentially relevant were obtained and one\nreviewer assessed them for inclusion. One reviewer\nextracted details of study design, participants and\noutcome data. In the event of any uncertainty, a\nsecond reviewer provided advice and validated the\ndata extraction. A list of the included studies is\ngiven in Appendix 15.\nData analysis\nApproach 1\nThe baseline MD score was used to categorise\nstudy participants into mild, moderate or severe\ndisease. The reduction in MD score at follow-up\nwas used to approximate a yearly rate of\nreduction. The yearly reduction was applied to\neach follow-up year. At each follow-up year, the\ncurrent stage of glaucoma was determined by the\nMD score as given in the present grading system.\nThe probability of progression per year was\nestimated by 1 divided by the number of years in\nthe same grade of OAG. For example, if baseline\naverage MD score was \u20134.0 dB the group would be\nconsidered mild disease. If the group were to\nprogress at \u20130.5 dB per year, it would take 5 years\nfor the group to progress to moderate disease\n(<\u20136.0 dB). The probability of yearly progression\nfrom mild to moderate disease would be 1\/5 = 0.2\nfor this cohort of patients. The average MD at\ndiagnosis was assumed to be \u20134.0 dB in the\nprojections.\nApproach 2\nStudy participants were categorised into mild,\nmoderate or severe disease according to either\nbaseline MD scores or study reported severity. The\npercentage of people progressing was converted\ninto an approximate yearly probability of\nprogressing by dividing the percentage by the\naverage length of follow-up.\nResults\nApproach 1\nAs described in the section \u2018Effectiveness of\nglaucoma treatment\u2019 (p. 87), two randomised trials\nwere identified that compared a treated group\nwith a no-treatment control group.27,254 Table 28\ndescribes the type of participants in each group,\nprogression in terms of MD changes and\npercentage who progressed according to each\nstudy definition of progression. Further details can\nbe found in Appendix 16. The results from the\nEMGT suggested that the average rate (treated\nand untreated) of progression was approximately\nEvidence of effectiveness\n90\u20130.4 dB per year (12 \u00d7 \u20130.03 dB per month) for\nmild OAG patients and the CNTGS suggested that\nthe average rate in moderate OAG patients might\nbe \u20130.45 dB per year (average of two groups).\nThere were no included studies within a severe\ndisease OAG population, therefore it was assumed\nthat the rate of MD progression in a severe\npopulation was \u20130.5 dB year (a linear projection\nfrom the mild and moderate estimates). The three\nestimates of MD progression per year for treated\npatients were used to derive a probability of\nprogressing between mild to moderate, moderate\nto severe and severe to visual impairment using\nmethods described previously (Table 29).\nInterpretation\nThe average treated patient population would\nprogress from mild OAG disease to moderate\ndisease in 5 years, resulting in a yearly probability\nof progression of 0.2. The population would be\nmoderate OAG for 14 years and remain with\nsevere disease for a further 16 years, resulting in a\ncumulative time to become visually impaired of\n35 years.\nReflecting the uncertainty in these estimates, \nfor the economic modelling, a triangular\ndistribution was used and assumes the rate of\nprogression may be half this rate or as much as\ntriple this rate.\nApproach 2\nTwo additional randomised trials255,262 and seven\ncohort studies259,263\u2013268 met the inclusion criteria\nand were included. Table 30 describes the type of\nparticipants in each group, and progression\npercentage who progressed according to each\nstudy definition of progression. Further details can\nbe found in Appendix 17.\nFrom the results presented in Table 30, it was\npossible to estimate the yearly probability of\nprogressing from the various OAG stages.\n\u25cf the yearly probability of progressing from mild\nto moderate disease from five studies was\n0.028,255 0.05,268 0.066,265 0.10266 and 0.11263\n(median = 0.066)\n\u25cf the yearly probability of progressing from\nmoderate to severe disease from six studies was\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n91\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

Applying a simple\nlinear progression assumption, it would take\n28 years (15\/0.54, 95% CI 21 to 36 years) for the\nentire population to progress to blindness.\nInterpretation\nThere was significant heterogeneity between study\nprobabilities. The study-estimated probabilities of\nyearly progression for moderate to severe and for\nsevere to visually impaired provided no evidence\nthat approach 1 estimates were clearly wrong.\nIndeed, the median estimates were within 0.02.\nThe approach 1 estimated probability for mild to\nmoderate progression was significantly higher\nthan for approach 2. This difference may be partly\nexplained by the assumption of severity of mild\ndisease at diagnosis. On the grading scale used in\nthis review, assuming a baseline MD of \u20134 dB\nimplied that the eye needed to progress by \u20132 dB\nto become moderate. Clearly, if more mild disease\nwere diagnosed, the probability of progression to\nmoderate disease would decrease (e.g. \u20133 dB would\ndecrease the probability of progression to 12%).\nDiscussion\nApproximate estimates for the probability of\nprogression from mild to moderate, moderate to\nsevere and severe to visually impaired were\nderived. Approach 1 used a simple linear\nextrapolation of the results from the CNTGS and\nEMGT studies. The model suggested that it would\ntake 35 years for a treated population to progress\nto unilateral blindness. Such an estimate is\nplausible if the Olmsted County study is\nextrapolated to the entire population264 (35 years\nis contained within the Olmsted County study 95%\nconfidence interval) and is similar to the estimate\nderived by Quigley and colleagues,266 which\nsuggested that progression to blindness would take\napproximately 40 years.\nStrengths and limitations\nExtrapolating trial outcomes from short-term\nfollow-up to longer term outcome risks serious\nunderestimation or overestimation if the\nassumption of linear progression is incorrect.\nUsing two complementary approaches enabled\npartial validation of the extrapolation in this study.\nThere is, therefore, some confidence that the\nestimated probabilities of progression between\nstages for the entire population of glaucoma\npatients are approximately correct. The risk of\nblindness is based on risk estimates for one eye,\ndriven by the available primary data, and is\ntherefore not necessarily representative of the risk\nof bilateral blindness. \nA \u2018black box\u2019 approach was taken to estimate\nprogression. That is, a \u2018precise\u2019 treatment path was\nnot formulated for different stages of glaucoma and\ndiffering presenting prognostic factors. Therefore,\nit is recognised that there may be some inaccuracy\nin the estimates for specific subgroups of glaucoma\npatients. This imprecision has been partially taken\ninto account in the economic modelling by\nassuming that the rate of progression may be as\nlittle as half the estimated rates or as much as triple\nthis rate. Using these assumptions, the modelling\nconsidered probabilities of progression that were\nbigger and smaller than any published estimates.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n93\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

The rationale for this\nwas that one aspect of the economic modelling was\nto identify which components of the economic\nmodel had the most significant impact on the\nresults before adding any further complexities to\nthe model.\nUsing MD to classify progression was not entirely\nsatisfactory. It is known that other non-\nglaucomatous disease, such as the presence of\ncataract, affects the MD. MD was used in this study\nbecause a continuous measure of progression was\ndesirable, but studies rarely reported progression\non a continuous scale. The more commonly used\nstage models (event-based models) for progression\nhave a major limitation: all patients within a\nspecific stage are considered to be at the same\nseverity of disease and therefore stage models fail\nto identify eyes that may be progressing but have\nnot yet reached the threshold to change a stage.\nThe stage approach gives little information on the\nrate and magnitude of change within patients.276\nA better approach to estimating progression might\nbe trend-based approaches where progression rate\nis examined on individual visual field points using\nregression analysis. Some studies have suggested\nthat such an approach is more sensitive than\nevent-based methods.256,258,262\nConclusions\nMain findings \nUsing RCTs of treatment versus no treatment, the\npooled hazard ratio of progression for treatment\nversus no treatment was 0.65 (95% CI 0.49 to\n0.87). Extrapolating the trial results predicted that\na treated person would progress from mild to at\nleast unilateral blindness in approximately\n35 years. Untreated, the time to progression is\nestimated as 23 years.\nFuture research\nThe lack of consensus on an appropriate\ndefinition of \u2018progression\u2019 is a major impediment\nto understanding the rate and magnitude of\nchange in glaucoma patients and consequently the\nlong-term effects of various treatments. A\ncomparison of event-based and trend-based\nscoring systems needs to be undertaken in a large\nprospective cohort of glaucoma patients who\nrepresent the spectrum of glaucoma disease.\nEvidence of effectiveness\n94T\nhis chapter has three main sections: an outline\nof the principles of economic evaluation, a\nsystematic review reporting economic evaluations\nof OAG screening strategies and a final section\nreporting the economic evaluation, using a\nMarkov model, the structure of which was outlined\nin the section \u2018Economic model\u2019 (p. 15), to assess\nthe cost-effectiveness of screening for OAG.\nPrinciples of economic evaluation\nThe decision to use resources to provide one\nmethod of identifying OAG would mean that the\nopportunity to use them in other desirable ways\n(either to provide another method of identification\nor to meet an entirely different health need) is\ngiven up. The cost of this decision is the benefits\n(health gains, etc.) that could have been obtained\nhad the resources been used another desirable way.\nThis is the economic notion of \u2018opportunity cost\u2019.\nStrictly speaking, the opportunity cost of a decision\nto use resources in one way is equivalent to the\nbenefits forgone in the next best alternative use of\nthese resources. Economic evaluation is a method\nof providing decision-makers with information\nabout the opportunity cost of the decisions that\ncould be made. It is the comparative analysis of\nalternative courses of action in terms of both their\ncosts (resource use) and effectiveness (health\neffects).277 An economic evaluation, in this context,\nwould involve assessing the relative costs and\nbenefits associated with alternative identification\nstrategies, including screening, for OAG. The\nobjective of such an economic evaluation would be\nto provide information to assist decision-makers in\nthe allocation of the available resources so that\nbenefits can be maximised. How an economic\nevaluation brings together information on costs\nand effects is illustrated in Figure 39. The vertical\naxis represents the difference in costs between an\nexperimental (e.g. screening for OAG) and a\ncontrol treatment (e.g. no formal screening for\nOAG). An evaluation of alternative strategies for\nidentifying OAG cost estimates might typically be\nexpected to include the value of the resources used\nto provide the strategy as well as the resource\nconsequences of that strategy (e.g. the costs of\ntreatment). The horizontal axis represents\ndifferences in effectiveness between the two\napproaches. The effectiveness of the alternative\nstrategies might be measured in clinical terms (e.g.\nreductions in IOP), natural terms (e.g. cases of\nvisual impairment avoided) or more economic\nmeasures, such as quality-adjusted life-years\n(QALYs). The latter combines estimates of both\nquality of life and length of life. The wider the\ndefinition of benefit used, the more likely it is to\nmeasure outcomes of importance to individuals.\nIn the north-west and south-east quadrants of\nFigure 39 a clear decision about which treatment\nshould be preferred is provided because one or\nother treatment dominates. In the north-west\nquadrant the experimental treatment is more\ncostly and provides less benefit and therefore the\ncontrol treatment is more efficient (is dominant).\nIn the south-east quadrant the opposite situation\noccurs and the experimental treatment is more\nefficient (is dominant) as it is less costly and\nprovides more benefit. The circle in the centre of\nthe figure represents the possibility that no\nmeaningful differences in costs or benefits exist\nbetween the treatments and for practical purposes\nthe two interventions are equally efficient. In the\ntwo remaining areas of the figure, the north-east\nand south-west quadrants, a judgement is required\nas to whether the more effective treatment is worth\nthe extra cost. To aid these judgements,\ninformation can be provided in terms of an\nincremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The\nhigher the ICER of one intervention compared\nwith another, the less likely it is that this\nintervention will be considered efficient. \nSystematic review of cost-\neffectiveness of screening for OAG\nAims and objectives\nThe aim of this systematic review is to address the\nfollowing research questions. From the perspective\nof the UK NHS, is screening for OAG cost-\neffective and which method of screening is most\nlikely to be cost-effective? These questions were\naddressed by:\n\u25cf systematically identifying and quality assessing\nall the economic evaluations comparing\nalternative methods of screening for OAG\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n95\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

Studies were\nexcluded if they did not attempt to relate cost to\noutcome data. The following types of paper were\nalso excluded: methodological papers, papers that\nreviewed economic evaluations (although their\nreference lists were checked), discursive analysis of\ncosts\/benefits, partial evaluation studies such as\ncost analyses, efficacy or effectiveness evaluations\nand cost of treatment\/burden of illness papers. \nStudy population\nStudies had to be performed in adult populations.\nTypes of intervention\nAny intervention used for the screening of OAG.\nTypes of outcome\nThe outcomes of the review were costs (regardless\nof how estimated) and effects (no matter how\nthese had been specified). Additional, more\nspecific, secondary outcomes of the review were:\n\u25cf incremental costs per case of visual impairment\n(e.g. loss of vision below driving standard)\nprevented\n\u25cf incremental costs per year of visual impairment\n(e.g. loss of vision below driving standard)\nprevented\n\u25cf incremental costs per case of blindness\nprevented\n\u25cf incremental costs per additional QALY gained\n\u25cf incremental costs per number of case of OAG\ndetected.\nSearch strategy\nThe search strategy used to identify relevant\nstudies is described in detail in Chapter 4.\nData extraction strategy\nOne reviewer extracted the data according to the\nguidelines produced by the Centre for Reviews\nand Dissemination (CRD) for the critical appraisal\nof economic evaluations.91,278 Data extraction\nfocused on two key areas: the results of the\neconomic evaluations in terms of estimates of costs\nand effects, and the methods used to derive the\nEconomic analysis\n96\nExperimental \nintervention more costly\nControl\nintervention more costly\nControl intervention \nmore effective\nExperimental intervention\nmore effective\nNW NE\nSW SE\nFIGURE 39 Relationship between the difference in costs and effects between a new (experimental) intervention and a standard\n(control) interventionresults and their interpretation. Where the\neconomic evaluation had been based on a\nmodelling exercise, additional data extraction was\nperformed to describe the source of parameter\nestimates and the methods used to combine these\nestimates in the economic model. The criteria\nused were based on those developed by Philips\nand colleagues.91 Where included studies had\npreviously been included in NHS EED, these\nabstracts were also used to inform the review.\nExamples of the type of data extracted from the\nincluded studies are described below. \n\u25cf study characteristics\n\u2013 the research question\n\u2013 the study design\n\u2013 the comparison\n\u2013 the setting\n\u2013 the time-horizon of the study\n\u2013 the basis of costing\n\u25cf characteristics of the study population\n\u2013 numbers receiving or randomised to each\nintervention\n\u2013 other systematic differences in clinical\nmanagement\n\u2013 inclusion\/exclusion criteria\n\u2013 dates to which data on effectiveness and costs\nrelated\n\u25cf duration of follow-up for both costs and\neffectiveness\n\u25cf results\n\u2013 summary of effectiveness and costs (point\nestimate and if reported range or standard\ndeviation)\n\u2013 summary of cost-effectiveness\/utility (point\nestimate and if reported range or standard\ndeviation)\n\u2013 sensitivity analysis\n\u25cf conclusions as reported by the authors.\nTo estimate the secondary outcomes described\nabove, data were also extracted for each\nintervention considered on:\n\u25cf number of cases of visual impairment (e.g. loss\nof driving vision) prevented\n\u25cf average number of years of visual impairment\n(e.g. loss of driving vision) prevented\n\u25cf number of cases of blindness prevented\n\u25cf average total cost per person screened\n\u25cf number of cases of OAG\n\u25cf average number of QALYs.\nQuality assessment strategy\nThe quality of the studies was assessed using\nFigures 1\u201311 of the CRD report.278 Study quality\nwas summarised in terms of how the literature on\neffectiveness was retrieved, how the effectiveness\ndata were derived from the studies, justification\nprovided for the strategies assessed, how costs\nwere determined, whether all relevant costs were\nincluded, the perspective of the analysis (i.e.\nwhose costs and benefits were considered\nimportant to the decision-maker), the measures\nused to determine cost-effectiveness and the\nnature of the sensitivity analysis performed. \nData synthesis\nNo attempt was made to synthesise quantitatively\nthe studies that were identified. Data from the\nincluded studies were summarised to identify\ncommon results, variations and weaknesses across\nstudies. If a study only reported average cost-\neffectiveness ratios then, where possible, the data\nwere reanalysed to provide estimates of\nincremental cost-effectiveness. The ICERs were\nobtained by calculating the difference in costs (\u2206C)\nbetween one non-dominated strategy and its\npreceding non-dominated strategy, and dividing it\nby the difference in effectiveness (\u2206E) between\nthese two strategies. It is important to note that\nthe strategies were compared only for the same\nage groups. It was considered likely that the\nidentified studies would provide data for different\npatient groups (e.g. those aged 45 and over, those\naged 65 and over), a range of pretesting risks (e.g.\ngeneral population risk, strong pretest suspicion\nof OAG) and a range of screening and diagnostic\ninterventions. Therefore, separate summaries were\ndeveloped for each set of studies that considered\nthe same patient group, pretesting risk and\ndiagnostic intervention. Where possible, the data\nextracted from the included studies were used to\nprovide estimates of the secondary outcomes\ndescribed above. \nResults\nNumber of studies identified\nAs described in Chapter 4, a total of 431 titles or\nabstracts were identified by the searches conducted\nfor the economic evaluation of screening (Table 2)\nand a further 65 titles or abstracts were identified\nfrom the general search of databases such as\nHealth Management Information Consortium and\nHTA. Sixty-seven full-text papers were retrieved\nfor assessment. From these, five eligible reports\nwere identified.279\u2013283 One study was reported in\ntwo separate reports279,280 and the journal version\nwas used as the primary publication.280 The four\neligible studies used modelling techniques of\nvarying levels of complexity to arrive at estimates\nof cost-effectiveness. These studies are listed in \nAppendix 18 and summarised in Appendix 19.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n97\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.The following section critiques and summarises\nthe included studies. \nCharacteristics of the included studies \nAll four studies assessed cost-effectiveness of\nscreening for primary OAG. There was one study\neach from the USA,282 and Canada280 and two\nstudies from the UK.281,283 The analysis by\nGottlieb and colleagues compared hypothetical\nscreening programmes for a population of one\nmillion individuals aged between 40 and\n79 years.282 Boivin and colleagues considered the\nintroduction of screening programmes for those\naged 40 and 79 years in the Province of Quebec in\nCanada.280 In 1991 the population of this\nprovince was estimated to be 2.6 million.280\nGooder considered the implications of adopting\nscreening for a 100,000 cohort of the UK general\npopulation aged 40 years or more.281 In the final\nstudy, by Tuck and Crick, the screening strategies\nwere compared for a hypothetical cohort of 10,000\nCaucasians aged 40 years and above.283 In all four\nstudies the screening strategies considered would\nbe implemented in a community setting. The\ncharacteristics of the included studies are\nsummarised in Appendix 19.\nScreening strategies considered in the studies\nA description of the strategies considered by each\nof the studies is provided in Appendix 19 and\nsummarised in Table 31. In only one of these\nstudies was screening compared with current, no\nscreening, practice.281\nGottlieb and colleagues considered seven different\nscreening strategies: ophthalmoscopy, tonometry\n(at two different thresholds of >21 mmHg and\n>24 mmHg), manual perimetry (using HF, MPT,\nGlobuck or Goldmann fields) and automated\nperimetry.282 Boivin and colleagues considered\nEconomic analysis\n98\nTABLE 31 Description of screening strategies considered by each of the studies\nStudy Strategy Screening interval\nGottlieb, 1983282 Ophthalmoscopy, with positives referred to ophthalmology Once only\nTonometry  21 mmHg, with positives referred to ophthalmology Once only\nTonometry  24 mmHg, with positives referred to ophthalmology Once only\nHF fields, with positives referred to ophthalmology Once only\nMPT fields, with positives referred to ophthalmology Once only\nGlobuck fields, with positives referred to ophthalmology Once only\nGoldmann fields, with positives referred to ophthalmology Once only\nBoivin, 1996280 Tonometry (cut-off not stated), fundoscopy, with positives for either getting  1, 3 or 5 years\ngonioscopy and perimetry\nTonometry (cut-off not stated), with positives getting fundoscopy, gonioscopy  1, 3 or 5 years\nand perimetry\nGooder, 1995281 Opportunistic screening at the time of a routine eye test Once only\nTonometry Once only\nTuck, 1997283 Tonometry and Henson fields Once only\nTonometry and perimetry if IOP > 20 mmHg Once only\nTonometry and perimetry if IOP > 22 mmHg Once only\nTonometry at thresholds of IOP > 22 mmHg Once only\nOphthalmoscopy (sv) Once only\nPerimetry Once only\nOphthalmoscopy and tonometry (sv) Once only\nOphthalmoscopy and tonometry, positives referred to perimetry (sv) Once only\nOphthalmoscopy and tonometry, positives referred to perimetry (lx) Once only\nOphthalmoscopy and perimetry (sv) Once only\nOphthalmoscopy and tonometry (lx) Once only\nOphthalmoscopy and tonometry, \u2018high-risk\u2019 candidates referred to perimetry (sv) Once only\nTonometry at thresholds of IOP > 20 mmHg Once only\nOphthalmoscopy and tonometry, \u2018high-risk\u2019 candidates referred to perimetry (lx) Once only\nOphthalmoscopy and perimetry (lx) Once only\nOphthalmoscopy and tonometry and perimetry (sv) Once only\nOphthalmoscopy and tonometry and perimetry (lx) Once only\nOphthalmoscopy (lx) Once only\nHF, Harrington\u2013Flock; lx, lax referral criteria; MPT, manual perimetry technique; sv, severe referral criteria.two main strategies.280 In the first, initial\nscreening was with tonometry (although the cut-off\nvalues were not stated) and fundoscopy, and if\nthere were abnormal findings in either, individuals\nwere then investigated with gonioscopy and\nperimetry. The second strategy was to screen the\npopulation initially with tonometry alone followed\nby gonioscopy, fundoscopy and perimetry in those\nwith abnormal IOP. A total of 12 scenarios was\nassessed by varying the age range, participation,\ncompliance and treatment efficacy rates for these\ntwo main strategies.280 Gooder compared two\nactive screening strategies with opportunistic\nscreening performed at the time of a routine eye\ntest (current standard UK practice). The first\nscreening strategy considered was tonometry and\nthe second involved non-contact tonometry and\nfield tests. People testing positive were then\nreferred on to hospital services.281 Tuck and Crick\nconsidered 18 different screening strategies.283\nThese strategies varied in terms of the tests used\n(ophthalmoscopy, tonometry and perimetry), the\ncut-off values used for tonometry (IOP > 20 or\nIOP > 22 mmHg) and the severity of referral\ncriteria. Referral criteria depended on IOP, visual\nfield defects (defined as \u201ca failure on the 66-point\ntest, suspicious zone or below, of a Henson\nsuprathreshold field\u201d), CDRs, an assessment of\nrisk based on family history of glaucoma or high\nmyopia. Severity was defined as relatively lax or\nsevere. An example of severe criteria for referral\nwould be that patients with IOP between 26 and\n30 mmHg would only be referred if the CDR was\n>0.4 or if there was a visual field defect. Lax\nreferral criteria would refer all patients with an\nIOP between 26 and 30 mmHg regardless of the\nresults of the other tests.\nAs described in Table 31, only Boivin and\ncolleagues assessed cost-effectiveness based on a\ncyclical screening mode (i.e. once every year, every\n3 years or every 5 years).280 The other studies\nassumed that the screening was to be done only\nonce.281\u2013283\nQuality of included studies\nAll studies were based on models, but none\nspecified the type of model used. Two studies dealt\nwith cost-effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment\ncombined280,282 and one study reported the results\nin terms of two different measures of cost-\neffectiveness as well as one measure of\ncost\u2013utility.281 The final study considered the costs\nand effects of diagnosis only (i.e. it excluded the\ncosts and effects consequent on diagnosis).283\nNone of the studies implicitly or explicitly justified\nthe screening strategies compared. \nAll the included studies derived their literature on\neffectiveness from ad hoc searching, rather than\nfrom a systematic review. The estimates of\neffectiveness of diagnostic and treatment measures\nwere arbitrarily determined in all four studies by\nassumptions made from data from previous studies\nand on expert opinion. None of the studies clearly\nstated how they derived estimates of effectiveness\nfrom the included studies. Three studies clearly\nstated the sensitivities and specificities of the\ndiagnostic tests used in their modelling,281\u2013283\nwhereas one did not.280\nThe measures used to determine the effectiveness\nof the different strategies compared varied\nbetween studies. The measures included quality-\nadjusted years of vision (QAVYs) saved (with\nquality adjustment based on a subjective\nassessment of the number of years of vision that\nsomeone would forgo to avoid the side-effects of\ntreatment),282 disability-adjusted life-years\n(DALYs),281 years of blindness prevented\n(although in the study by Boivin and colleagues it\nwas unclear how these were calculated: no values\nwere reported, but number of years of blindness\nappeared to be the same as the number of cases of\nblindness avoided)280,281 and number of true\npositives identified.281,283\nAll four studies reported detailed data on how the\ncosts were derived and the price year to which\ncosts related (Table 32). One study reported costs\nin Canadian dollars,280 and two others reported\ncosts in US dollars, one for the year 1980282 and\none for 1995.283 The fourth study reported costs\nin 1995 UK pounds sterling.281 In the study by\nTuck and Crick costs were expressed in US dollars\nbut were originally calculated in UK pounds\nsterling and converted to US dollars using an\nexchange rate of \u00a31 to US$1.55.283 Only Boivin\nand colleagues reported resource quantities and\ncosts separately.280\nAlthough there were variations between the\nstudies, the type of resource use considered\nrelevant to include in the costing was generally\nsimilar. However, none of the studies included the\ncosts of the organisation of the screening\nprogramme such as personnel costs and costs for\ninviting the participants. \nIn the study by Gottlieb and colleagues, the costs\nfor diagnosis and treatment in this analysis were\nestimated from the Massachusetts Blue Cross\/Blue\nShields average daily hospital reimbursement rates\nin Massachusetts in the year 1980.282 The average\ncost of medications was estimated by doubling\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n99\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

The costs included those of\nscreening tests, drugs, diagnostic evaluation,\nphysician visits with and without treatment,\nsurgery for glaucoma and surgery for cataracts as a\ncomplication of glaucoma treatment. Indirect\nsocietal costs were not taken into account in the\nanalysis. The analysis by Boivin and colleagues\nincluded costs for diagnostic tests and treatment\n(by both the clinician and optometrist), societal\ncosts for the blind in terms of aids (reading,\nwriting and mobility) and disability pensions.280\nThe clinician costs were based on fees for\nprocedures performed in a private healthcare\nsetting. Societal costs for blindness were obtained\nfrom the budgets for the ten rehabilitation\nagencies in the Quebec provinces and disability\npension costs were obtained from the R\u00e9gie des\nrentes du Quebec. The costs were not adjusted for\ninflation. Treatment costs were based on a\nhypothetical model of disease progression, which\nwas based on data from selected studies. Gooder\nincluded the cost of standard optometrist cost for\nan eye test and assumed costs for the other tests\nperformed.281 The only other cost included was\nthe cost of a first outpatient visit. Tuck and Crick\nassumed that the costs were based on screening\nconducted as part of a general eye examination by\nan ophthalmologist or optometrist, usually in\nconjunction with prescribing lenses.283 The main\nassumption was that the initial screening of 10,000\npeople would be performed by a single\nprofessional examiner over a 6-year period. The\ncost analysis covered cost per hour of optometrist\n(including all overheads for premises, etc.), capital\ncosts (tonometer and field screener) and cost of\nsecondary examination at a clinic per patient visit\n(before diagnosis). The cost analysis only covered\nthe costs of diagnosis and not the costs of\nsubsequent treatment and monitoring. The\nauthors of the economic analysis did not take\nindirect (societal) costs into account.\nOnly two studies performed discounting,282,283\nalthough it was relevant to all. In one study future\ncosts were discounted at a rate of 5% per\nannum282 and in the other, reusable equipment\ncosts were annualised using a 6% discount\nrate.282,283 Only one of the studies clearly stated\nthe time-horizon of the analysis.281\nIn all four studies the assessment of cost-\neffectiveness was presented from a government\nperspective. Two studies reported average cost \nper year of blindness avoided280,281 and one the\naverage cost per true positive case found.281,283\nGottlieb and colleagues reported average and\nincremental cost per quality-adjusted year of \nvision saved282 and Gooder reported incremental\n(versus current practice) cost per DALY \nsaved.281\nThree studies performed some form of sensitivity\nanalysis, although this was limited to simple one-\nway analysis (i.e. changing only one parameter at\na time; such an approach ignores interactions\nbetween different parameters).280,282,283 Sensitivity\nanalyses were performed around age, disease\nprevalence and treatment effectiveness rates. The\nspecifics of the sensitivity analyses varied between\nstudies reflecting the different data, outcome\nmeasures and model structure used. For example,\nGottlieb and colleagues assessed the impact of\nvarying the prevalence of raised IOP, disease\nprogression, treatment effectiveness, variations in\nsurgery refusal rate and proportion of patients\ncontrolled with primary medications or surgery\nalone.282 In the study by Boivin and colleagues\nsensitivity analysis was performed with variations\nin patient age range, frequency of screening, tests\nused, participation rate and the rate of\neffectiveness.280 Tuck and Crick, in their sensitivity\nanalysis, considered varying the prevalence of\nprimary OAG, sensitivity values, predictive values,\nthe costs of examination and the definition of\ntrue-positive cases.283\nSummary of the results of the included studies\nAs described above the included studies were\nbroadly similar with respect to population,\nscreening and treatment costs and their results are\nsummarised in Tables 33\u201338 (and reported in more\ndetail in Appendix 20). Where necessary, the\nICERs presented in the tables were calculated, by\nthe reviewers, from data provided in the included\nstudies. Nevertheless, data were not reported in\nsufficient detail to reinterpret the results of the\nstudies in terms of a common outcome measure.\nTables 33 and 34 report the results of the\ncost\u2013utility analysis conducted. Table 33 reports the\nfindings from Gottlieb and colleagues.282 In this\ntable the results are only presented for three of the\nseven age groups considered and all screening\nstrategies that were dominated (i.e. less effective\nthan less costly alternatives) have been omitted.\nOphthalmoscopy was the least costly but least\neffective strategy for all age groups except for the\n70\u201374 year olds (Table 33). As the table shows, out\nof the seven strategies considered (see Table 31)\nonly between three and four strategies were not\ndominated. The ordering of the interventions\nvaried between age groups and this indicates the\nlikely importance of age on estimates of cost-\neffectiveness. It also indicates that the optimal\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n101\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

strategies\nconsidered were more effective but more costly\nthan current practice.281 However, screening with\ntonometry might not be considered cost-effective\nwhile screening using NCT and fields might be\nconsidered worthwhile (the incremental cost per\nDALY saved compared with current practice was\nestimated to be approximately \u00a322,000). \nThe values reported for the cost\u2013utility analyses\nare difficult to interpret because of the different\nyears and countries to which the data relate as well\nas differences in the technologies considered and\noutcome measures used. Presenting the relative\ndifference in costs and effects provides more\ncomparative information. For example, in Gottlieb\nand colleagues the cost of screening with\ntonometry with a threshold IOP of 24 mmHg is\n155% of the cost of ophthalmoscopy.282 These\nestimates put into context the increases in costs\nand effects that accrue from adopting a more\neffective but more costly screening strategy. \nThe results in terms of incremental cost per year\nof blindness avoided are presented using the \nsame approach as those described for the\ncost\u2013utility analyses described above. Using the\ndata from Boivin and colleagues, the incremental\ncosts per year of blindness were estimated\n(Table 35).280 With these data it is unclear whether\nany of the more costly but effective strategies are\nworthwhile compared with the strategy of\ntonometry or tonometry and fundoscopy as initial\ntests followed by fundoscopy, gonioscopy and\nperimetry. The data from Gooder suggest lower\nincremental costs per year of blindness avoided\n(Table 36),281 and indicate that screening is more\nlikely to be cost-effective compared with data from\nBoivin and colleagues.280 However, the data are\nmore difficult to interpret because of the\ndifferences between the two studies, in terms of\ncomparators, methods and source data. Without\nfurther information it is not possible to\ndisentangle which factor or factors is most\nimportant.\nIn terms of incremental cost per case detected\ndata were available from two studies.281,283 Both\nscreening strategies considered by Gooder were\nconsiderably more effective than current practice,\nbut also more costly (Table 37).281 Tonometry was\nthe least effective and least costly of the two active\nstrategies considered, but as it was compared with\nthe relatively inexpensive current practice the cost\nper case detected was relatively high. In contrast,\nthe incremental cost per case detected for NCT\nand field testing strategy compared with\ntonometry was relatively modest. The data from\nTuck and Crick also suggest that tonometry was\nthe least costly but also least effective screening\nstrategy test (Table 38). This is because it was\nassociated with a poor sensitivity (69% at an IOP\ncut-off of 20 mmHg).283 Screening strategies\ninvolving ophthalmoscopy alone or in\ncombination with either tonometry or perimetry\nwere dominated (i.e. less effective and more costly)\nand have not been included in Table 38, although\nthey are presented in Appendix 20. The use of\neither tonometry followed by perimetry or\nophthalmoscopy followed by tonometry and\nperimetry was more effective than tonometry\nalone. However, the cost rapidly increased and it\nwould require society to pay an additional US\n$18,500 per additional case detected associated\nwith adopting a strategy of ophthalmoscopy,\ntonometry and perimetry for referral candidates\nwith lax referral criteria for further evaluation\ncompared with a screening strategy of perimetry\nalone.\nDiscussion\nDespite an extensive systematic search of the\nliterature only four studies that assessed the cost-\neffectiveness of screening strategies for glaucoma\nwere identified. The latest of the included studies\nwas published in 1997 and it analysed costs based\non 1995 prices.283 As a basis for decision-making\nabout the desirability of adopting screening for\nOAG, our judgement is that this evidence base is\ninsufficient: the diagnostic tests and treatment\ninterventions available for primary OAG have\nchanged since the identified studies were\nconducted and the tests and treatment\ninterventions used in routine clinical practice now\nmay have different effects from those that were\nassessed in the included studies. It is quite\npossible that the cost-effectiveness of glaucoma\nscreening, using currently available tests and\ntreatment options, may differ markedly from the\nestimates provided by the studies described in this\nreview. Moreover, some of the screening tests used\nin the studies, such as manual perimetry\ntechniques (HF, MPT and Globuck field tests), are\nno longer routinely used in clinical practice. There\nhave been developments in diagnostic tests such as\nSAP, which is currently the choice for visual field\ntesting.

All rights reserved.\nA further limitation of the four studies is that only\none included a \u2018no-screening\u2019 strategy.281\nUnfortunately, the method of assembling data for\nuse in this economic evaluation was flawed as it\nwas not based on any systematic assembly and\nrelied on indirect comparisons. Therefore, none of\nthe studies was able reliably to address the\nquestion as to whether any form of screening\nwould be worthwhile. \nIt is also important to be aware of the\nmethodological limitations of the included studies.\nFirst, it is unclear whether the studies used the\nbest available evidence for the diagnostic\nperformance of the tests and the effectiveness of\ntreatments. The methods used to derive estimates\nof sensitivity and specificity of screening tests as\nwell as the effectiveness of treatment interventions\nused in the economic model were poor. They were\nbased on ad hoc searching, rather than on a\nsystematic review. Such an approach has been\nrecognised to be subjective and therefore prone to\nbias and error.284 Hence, it is possible that the\nselection of evidence in the included studies may\nhave been biased. This is a weakness observed in\neconomic evaluations of other treatment\nconditions.285 Furthermore, all the studies\nconsidered different measures of effectiveness \nfor the cost-effectiveness analysis. Again, this\nmakes it difficult to draw comparisons between\nstudies.\nTwo of the studies considered screening in\ncountries other than the UK and differences in\nreimbursement strategies and costs complicate the\ninterpretation from a UK perspective.280,282\nCurrent UK prices are markedly different from the\nprices quoted in the two included UK studies.\nWhile all four studies explained in detail how the\ncosts for the different strategies were derived, only\none study presented resource use and costs\nseparately.280 This makes it difficult to judge\nwhether these data are applicable to the UK. Only\none study considered a cyclical screening strategy\n(i.e. once every 3 years, etc.),280 and the failure of\nthe others to consider such an approach is\nunrealistic as the incidence of glaucoma increases\nwith age (see Chapter 5). \nThe effectiveness of screening is not just\ndependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the\ntest used. It also depends on a range of other\nparameters, such as acceptance of screening,\ntreatment efficacy rate and compliance. A variety\nof different values was used across the studies and\nthese values were either implicit (e.g. assuming\n100% compliance with treatment) or explicit (e.g.\nBoivin and colleagues assumed a 75% compliance\nrate with treatment).280\nThe uncertainty surrounding estimates of cost-\neffectiveness was also very poorly addressed by all\nfour studies. The simple one-way sensitivity\nanalysis used in three studies is unlikely to have\nfully explored the full extent of the uncertainty\npresent in each evaluation.280,282,283\nConclusions\nVery few economic evaluations comparing\nalternative screening strategies (including no\nscreening) for OAG are available. Those studies\nthat were identified suffered from numerous\nweaknesses that would limit their usefulness for\ndecision-making in the UK at this time.\nFurthermore, the differences between the studies\nin terms of tests, populations, assumed\neffectiveness of tests and treatment as well as costs\nmakes it difficult to disentangle which factors are\nthe key determinants of cost-effectiveness. On the\nbasis of the data summarised in this review there is\nan insufficient evidence base for judging whether\nscreening for OAG should take place, and if it\nshould take place, how it should be performed.\nThese findings confirm that further research is\nrequired on the cost-effectiveness of alternative\nscreening strategies and such work should be\nbased on the systematic consideration of the\nevidence on acceptability, effectiveness and cost of\nalternative screening strategies relevant to current\npractice. This evaluation is described in the next\nsection.\nEconomic evaluation of screening\nfor OAG\nThe cost-effectiveness of screening for OAG was\nassessed using a Markov model. The structure of\nthe model was described in the section \u2018Economic\nmodel\u2019 (p. 15). The interventions compared within\nthe model are first briefly described, before the\nmethods used to obtain the necessary data to\npopulate the model are presented. The methods\nused to present estimates of cost-effectiveness for\nthe base-case analysis and the key areas of\nuncertainty addressed by sensitivity analysis on the\nbase case are then described. Further sensitivity\nanalysis focused on situations where it is believed\nscreening may possibly be cost-effective is next\ndescribed. The following two subsections report\nthe results of the base case and its associated\nsensitivity analysis, as well as the results of the\nfurther focused sensitivity analyses. Finally, the\nimplications of these results are discussed.Economic analysis\n106\nT\nA\nB\nL\nE\n \n3\n7\nI\nn\nc\nr\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\na\nl\n \nc\no\ns\nt\n \np\ne\nr\n \nc\na\ns\ne\n

and diagnostic interventions are\ndescribed in detail elsewhere (see the section\n\u2018Economic model\u2019, p. 15). In brief, three strategies\nhave been considered: one representing current\npractice and the two alternative screening\nstrategies (see Figures 5\u20137, pp. 14\u201315). Current\npractice reflects current glaucoma detection by\ncase finding by a community optometrist as part\nof a routine eye test. The two alternative screening\nstrategies vary in how screening would be\norganised. In one strategy individuals are invited\nfor a screening examination by a glaucoma-trained\noptometrist. In the second strategy individuals are\ninvited for a simple test assessing either visual\nfield loss or structural damage, together with a\nmeasurement of the IOP by a technician.\nIndividuals identified as at risk or positive by these\ntechnician tests would then be seen by a glaucoma\noptometrist. In all three strategies any individual\nidentified as positive at the end of screening or\ncase finding would be referred to an\nophthalmologist for definitive diagnosis and, if\nnecessary, treatment. \nWith respect to the actual test used in the various\nstrategies it was concluded that for the purposes of\nthe economic evaluation the IOP test used by the\ntechnician is Goldmann applanation tonometry\nwith disposable tips and a slit-lamp microscope.\nFor the second assessment within the \u2018technician\nscreening\u2019 strategy, there is a number of possible\nscreening tests available; details of the tests and\ntheir performance are described in Chapters 3\nand 6. The model included a range of sensitivity\nand specificity values, rather than modelling the\nperformance of one test or combination of tests as\nnone of the candidate tests, or combinations of\ntests was clearly superior (Chapter 6).\nThe glaucoma optometrist assessment was\nassumed to be the same test combination as\nophthalmologist diagnosis. This diagnostic test \nis a combination of IOP measurement by GAT, \nslit-lamp examination, fundoscopy and a visual\nfield test. \nManagement of glaucoma\nShould the ophthalmologist diagnose OAG, it has\nbeen assumed that treatment would be initiated.\nThe following treatment pathway has been\nassumed in the model. Initial medical treatment\nwould be with a topical treatment  -blocker or\nprostaglandin analogue). If that failed, this would\nbe followed by an additional drop of another class\nof medications. For those patients for whom this\nfails, argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) or surgery\n(trabeculectomy) is the next treatment step. In\naddition to medications, treatment would involve\nvisits to the ophthalmologist every 6 weeks at the\nbeginning of treatment and a full assessment every\n6 months. After surgery the patient would be seen\nat an ophthalmology outpatient clinic at 1, 2, 4, 8,\n12 and 26 weeks after surgery. \nParameter estimates used in the model\nParameter estimates required to populate the\nmodel were obtained from the systematic reviews\nof test accuracy, OAG epidemiology, treatment\neffectiveness and cost-effectiveness, as well as other\nsystematic, focused searches of the literature. The\nfollowing sections give details on the probabilities,\ncosts and utility data used, as well as the probability\ndistributions adopted within the model.\nProbabilities\nTable 39 shows data on prevalence, incidence and\nprogression of glaucoma used in the model.\nWithin the model, prevalence was not formally\nbased on data from the literature, as there were\nmany different subgroups for which screening\ncould be determined. The model was run for a\nrange of prevalence values, informed by the\nreview, aiming to identify those prevalences where\nscreening strategies might be considered\nworthwhile. Once these were determined they\nwere related to relevant subgroups to which the\nresults might apply.\nThe proportion of OAG subjects with each severity\nof disease was informed by the systematic review of\nepidemiology (see Table 10, p. 32, for details).\nHowever, data were limited, as the majority of\nstudies reporting severity did not report severity\nstatus for newly detected cases, and for the\nmajority of participants severity status was not\nreported. Estimation was therefore based on\nexpert opinion from ophthalmologists (RW, AAB\nand JB), and the included studies informed the\ndistribution around these estimates. Limited data\nwere obtained for incidence and progression of\nglaucoma. Incidence data were obtained as\ndescribed in Chapter 5. Progression data, as well\nas the relative rate of progression between treated\nand untreated individuals, were based on a review\nof randomised and non-randomised evidence\nreported in Chapter 7. For the probabilistic\nsensitivity analysis triangular distributions were\nchosen for incidence and progression, and a log-\nnormal distribution for the relative risk of\nprogression for treated compared with untreated\nindividuals.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n107\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.The annual probabilities of having an eye test are\npresented in Table 40. Data on these were scarce. It\nis plausible, for instance, that the annual\nprobabilities of having an eye test differ between a\ngeneral population and an OAG population, or\nbetween the same population in a screening or\nnon-screening strategy. Moreover, these\nprobabilities might also depend on the period\nbetween screening waves. The model structure\nallowed the incorporation of such differences.\nUnfortunately, data were not available at the level\nof detail required. Data on eye test, gender and\nage were obtained from the British Household\nPanel Survey (BHPS).286 The total sample size for\nthe BHPS was approximately 10,000 households\nfrom across the UK. Individuals in the included\nhouseholds are interviewed yearly. A probit\nregression model was used to obtain the\nprobabilities of having an eye test. Alternative data\nwere retrieved from the Sight Test Volume and\nWorkforce Survey 2003\/04 (STV&WS) and other\npublished studies.47,113 The results of the\nregression analysis of the BHPS data, consistent\nwith the STV&WS and published studies, were\nused in the model for the probability of having an\neye test (by a community optometrist) in the\ncurrent practice strategy. Normal probability\ndistributions were attached to the mean values for\nprobabilistic analysis. Screening acceptance data\nwere obtained from the epidemiology review\n(Chapter 5). Triangular distribution was attached\nto this parameter with upper and lower limits\nobtained from Hollows and Graham21 and Wolfs\nand colleagues,169 respectively.\nTable 41 shows data on test performances. Seven\nreports provided information on the accuracy of\nreferrals by community-based optometrists for\npeople with suspected glaucoma.287\u2013293 However,\nno studies were identified that reported the\ndiagnostic accuracy of the test strategy of\ncommunity optometrists or glaucoma-trained\nEconomic analysis\n108\nTABLE 39 Prevalence, incidence and progression of glaucoma\nProbability Value Source Distribution (values used to\ndefine the distribution)\nCohort start age  40 Base-case assumption 60 and 75 years old\nPrevalence of glaucoma 0 to 0.2\nProportion of glaucoma mild 0.50 Expert opinion\/Chapter 5 0.475 and 0.45 for 60 and 75 years\nold, respectively\nProportion of glaucoma moderate 0.30 Expert opinion\/Chapter 5\nProportion of glaucoma severe 0.15 Expert opinion\/Chapter 5\nProportion of visual impaired 0.05 Expert opinion\/Chapter 5 0.075 and 0.10 for 60 and 75 years\nold, respectively\nIncidence of glaucoma Chapter 5\n40 years old 0.0003 Chapter 5 Triangular (min. = 0.0001, \nlikeliest = 0.0003, max. = 0.0008)\n50 years old 0.0003 Chapter 5 Triangular (min. = 0.0001, \nlikeliest = 0.0003, max. = 0.0008)\n60 years old 0.0008 Chapter 5 Triangular (min. = 0.0002, \nlikeliest = 0.0008, max. = 0.0022)\n70 years old 0.00181 Chapter 5 Triangular (min. = 0.00068, \nlikeliest = 0.00181, max. =\n0.0044)\n80 years old 0.00141 Chapter 5 Triangular (min. = 0.00097, \nlikeliest = 0.00141, max. = 0.01)\nProgression to glaucoma moderate 0.25 \u2018Probability of glaucoma  Triangular (min. = 0.125, \ndeterioration from mild disease  likeliest = 0.25, max. = 0.75)\nto visual impairment\u2019 (p. 89)\nProgression to glaucoma severe 0.11 \u2018Probability of glaucoma  Triangular (min. = 0.055, \ndeterioration from mild disease to  likeliest = 0.11, max. = 0.33)\nvisual impairment\u2019 (p. 89)\nProgression to visual impaired 0.1 \u2018Probability of glaucoma  Triangular (min. = 0.05, \ndeterioration from mild disease to  likeliest = 0.1, max. = 0.30)\nvisual impairment\u2019 (p. 89)\nRR treated\u2013non-treated 0.65 \u2018Effectiveness of glaucoma  Log-normal, (mean = \u20130.43, \ntreatment\u2019 (p. 87) SD = 0.148)\nMortality Various See Appendix 21 for interim life tableoptometrists, or included sufficient data to\nproduce a 2 \u00d7 2 table to calculate sensitivity and\nspecificity.

A 0.5%\nprevalence of undetected glaucoma was assumed\n(1378 patients out of the total of 275,600 seen).\nThis allowed the calculation of false negatives \n(n = 942) and true negatives (n = 273,610) to\ncomplete a 2 x 2 table and provide an estimated\nsensitivity and specificity for community-based\noptometrist referrals for OAG glaucoma of 31.6%\nand 99.8%, respectively. \nTo estimate the diagnostic accuracy of glaucoma-\ntrained optometrists, data were used from a study\nin Grampian evaluating a pilot community\noptometry glaucoma service, the Grampian\nOptometrist Study. The purpose of this study was\nto assess the diagnostic accuracy of the\nmanagement decision made by accredited\nglaucoma optometrists. The optometrist decision\nwas compared with two reference standards: an\nophthalmologist with a special interest in glaucoma,\nand management decision made in usual care in\nthe hospital-based new patient clinic. The study\nwas completed in January 2006 and a publication\nis in preparation (Burr JM, Azuara-Blanco A,\nThomas R, McLennan G, University of Aberdeen:\npersonal communication, 2006). For the purpose\nof this analysis, disease was classified as OAG or\nocular hypertension requiring treatment. The\ncategories normal and discharged, and suspect\nrequiring optometric review were classified as no\ndisease. The consultant ophthalmologist with a\nspecial interest in glaucoma was the reference\nstandard. The sensitivity of the glaucoma\noptometrist was 0.73 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.85), with a\nspecificity of 0.96 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.99). \nData from the Baltimore Eye Survey were used for\nthe estimation of the proportion of normal or\nOAG patients with IOP of at least 26 mmHg.23\nDetails of this study can be found in Chapter 5.\nEstimation of the proportion of people able to\nperform the test (rate of indeterminancy) as part\nof the \u2018technician\u2019 screening strategy was obtained\nfrom the systematic review of screening tests (see\nChapter 6). In summary, for the tests the\npercentage of interpretable results ranged from\n80% for RNFL photography to 99% for SAP\n(threshold) and GAT, with a median rate across all\ntests of 97%. The number of studies contributing\ndata for each test was very small, although the\nrates were very similar across tests.\nThe model used sensitivity and specificity values\nfor the technician tests equal to or greater than\n0.8. For the ophthalmologist assessment an\nassumption was made that this was the gold\nstandard and that the sensitivity and specificity\nwere equal to 1.\nBeta distributions were used in the probabilistic\nsensitivity analysis for the accuracy of the\noptometrist in the current practice case-finding\nstrategy, and for the glaucoma optometrist test\nsensitivities and specificities. Beta distributions\nwere also used for the proportion of OAG\nindividuals with IOP of at least 26 mmHg and\nproportion of normal individuals with IOP below\n26 mmHg. Uniform distributions were used for\ntechnician further test indeterminacy, and for\nsensitivity and specificity. Finally, a uniform\ndistribution was assumed for the proportion of\npeople classified as glaucoma suspects\n(observation state) following diagnostic assessment\nby an ophthalmologist.\nCosts\nTables 42 and 43 show the cost estimates used in the\nmodel. All figures are reported in 2006 pounds\nsterling. Where costs had to be adjusted into a\ncommon price year, a 2% inflation rate was\nassumed where no inflation rate indices were\navailable. Table 42 shows the costs for the current\noptometrist case-finding strategy. The cost for the\noptometrist test was obtained from the NHS fee for\nan eye test paid to an optometrist.294 A triangular\ndistribution was assumed for this variable. No\ninformation on ranges was available, and as a\nconsequence rates of 0.5 and 1.5 times the likeliest\nvalue were used as lower and upper limits. The cost\nfor the ophthalmologist diagnosis was calculated\nusing data from Scottish National Statistics for April\n2004 to March 2005 (source: www.isdscotland.org).\nThe average reported cost for an ophthalmologist\noutpatient visit was \u00a365. This value was inflated by\nthe assumed 2% inflation rate for 2005\/06. It was\nalso assumed, based on the likely need for visual\nfield testing to be performed as an additional\noutpatient visit, that the ophthalmological diagnosis\nwould be equivalent to the cost of two standard\nophthalmology department outpatient\nconsultations. A triangular distribution was \nassumed for this parameter. The minimum and\nmaximum limits values were developed in the \nsame way as the likeliest mean value, but with the\nScottish NHS Board lowest and highest average\ncost for an ophthalmologist outpatient visit \n(i.e. \u00a338 and \u00a3195, respectively). This cost was \nalso used for cost of the observation state within \nthe model where it was assumed that patients\njudged to be at risk would be seen yearly for a\nmaximum of 5 years in this state or until OAG was\ndiagnosed.\nEconomic analysis\n110Costs of treatment were calculated from Traverso\nand colleagues.259 This is a Europe-based study\nand includes data for the UK by severity of\nglaucoma. In this study, the authors obtained\nrecords for 194 patients. Unfortunately, the\nsample sizes per country were not reported and\nthe figures might be subject to \u2018small numbers\u2019\nbias. The study reported costs in euros. The price\nyear used was not reported in the study so it was\nassumed to be 2004. Costs in the common price\nyear were estimated using the average 2004\nexchange rate from euros into pounds sterling\n(e.g. 0.6787; source: http:\/\/www.oanda.com\/\nconvert\/fxhistory), and a 2% annual inflation rate\nwas assumed. Triangular distributions were\nattached to treatment costs. No additional data\nwere available to allow for construction of a \nrange, so the assumption of 0.5 and 1.5 times the\nlikeliest value was applied. The exception to this\nwas the annual cost for visual impairment. The\nlikeliest value for the cost of visual impairment\nused in this model was based on the mean value of\nthe last two disease stages reported in Traverso\nand colleagues, as these corresponded to the\nvisual impairment category used in this study. A\ntriangular distribution was assumed for this cost,\nwith the minimum value being equal to the mean\nvalue of the less costly of the last two disease\nstages from Traverso and the maximum being\nequal to the mean value of the more costly of\nthese stages.\nTable 43 shows costs used for the screening\nstrategies. Screening invitation costs were obtained\nfrom Facey and colleagues.295 This was a study on\nthe organisation of the diabetic retinopathy\nscreening programme for Scotland. These figures\ninclude the cost for national coordination, local\nhealth board coordination, screening offices and\ncall and recall operation, development and\nmaintenance of call and recall software, and\ndevelopment and maintenance of image capture\nsoftware. It also assumed around 125,000 people\nare screened.

For the technician\nscreening strategy, the technician IOP test and\nsecond round test costs were obtained from the\nScottish Diabetic Retinopathy Screening study.295\nThe costs were based on the variable costs for non-\nmydriatic camera, hospital-based, one technical\nstaff screening estimated by this study. Triangular\ndistributions were attached to the costs in Table 43\nwith the assumption of 0.5 and 1.5 times the\nlikeliest value used to estimate minimum and\nmaximum values.\nData for treatment costs and ophthalmologist\ndiagnosis were the same as in the no-screening\nstrategy.\nHealth state utilities\nThe primary purpose of the economic model was\nto inform decision making in a UK setting. Recent\nguidance suggests that estimates of QALYs should\nideally be based on generic health state valuation\nmethods using UK population values,297 and\ntherefore a focused search of the literature and\nother relevant sources such as the Harvard\ncost\u2013utility database for relevant utility data was\nconducted. A number of studies reporting health\nstate utilities was identified. These studies used a\nwide variety of health state valuation techniques\nand utilities were obtained from a variety of\ndifferent settings and respondents. However, none\nof these studies reported utilities applicable to a\nUK decision-making setting. \nFor this reason the results of an ongoing study\nwere used to provide relevant utility estimates.\nThis study is attempting to develop a glaucoma-\nspecific measure of quality of life suitable for use\nin economic evaluations. The study involved the\nadministration of a participant self-completed\nquestionnaire to people with glaucoma attending\nthe ophthalmology outpatient departments of\nAberdeen Royal Infirmary and the United Leeds\nTeaching Hospital Trust (Leeds General Infirmary,\nSt James\u2019 Hospital and St George\u2019s Community\nEye Centre). UK members of the IGA also\nparticipated. All participants were asked to\ncomplete a questionnaire that included\ninformation on self-rating of glaucoma severity\n(mild, moderate or severe), a discrete choice\nexperiment and the EuroQol 5 Dimensions \n(EQ-5D). A subsample of patients from Aberdeen\nunderwent an objective assessment of glaucoma\nseverity. This was by a grading of the binocular\nvisual field using the integrated visual field\nmethod as described by Crabb and colleagues (see\nTable 1, p. 17).89 The responses to the EQ-5D were\nconverted to health state utilities using UK\npopulation tariffs and analysed according to the\nobjective and subjective assessment of glaucoma\nseverity (Kilonzo M, University of Aberdeen:\npersonal communication, 2006). Table 44 shows\nthe estimates of utility for those people with an\nobjective assessment of their glaucoma severity.\nAlthough these data are based on a subsample\nthey were chosen from the larger sample available\nfrom the two hospitals and the IGA owing to the\nrelatively poor concordance between objective and\nsubjective assessments of glaucoma severity\n(Appendix 22). Nevertheless, due to the\nuncertainty surrounding which data to use, the\nestimates provided by the whole data set (reported\nin Appendix 22) have been used as part of a\nsensitivity analysis. \nThe estimates used in the model, using these data,\nare detailed in Table 45.

The choice of these ages\nand a 3-year screening interval was arbitrary. It\nwas felt that the age groups covered the range\nover which screening might be considered and a\n3-year screening interval was considered a\nplausible starting point for the analysis (the\nimpact of using other screening intervals was\nconsidered). Gender-specific variables were not\navailable for any of the model parameters except\nfor mortality, and a decision was made to use male\nmortality rates in the base-case analysis, consistent\nwith good modelling practice, as they are a\nconservative assumption for screening.\nThe model was run for a range of possible OAG\nprevalence values and for a lifetime horizon.\nCycles length was set at 1 year. Costs are presented\nin 2006 pounds sterling and effectiveness in\nQALYs. A discount rate of 3.5% for costs and\nbenefits was used following guidelines for\ntechnology assessment by the National Institute\nfor Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).297\nResults are presented in ICERs. This measure is a\nratio of the difference in costs divided by the\ndifference in the effectiveness between two\nalternative strategies. These data can be\ninterpreted as how much society would have to\npay for an extra unit of effectiveness. Probabilistic\nanalysis results are presented for society\u2019s\nwillingness to pay values of \u00a310,000, \u00a320,000,\n\u00a330,000 and \u00a350,000.

These plot the\nprobability of each strategy being the optimal\ndecision against a range of values for society\u2019s\nwillingness to pay for an extra unit of\neffectiveness.

Full probabilistic analyses were carried\nout for the three cohort groups and rates of OAG\nprevalence from 0.1% and 20%. \nSensitivity analysis\nSensitivity analysis was carried out to explore\nuncertainties within the model. As described\nbelow, deterministic (one-way, two-way and\nmultiway) sensitivity analyses were carried out for\nthe main parameters within the model.\nProbabilistic sensitivity analyses were developed to\naddress further parameter uncertainty in the\nmodel. \nChanges to the screening interval\nThe effects of longer screening intervals (e.g. \n5 and 10 years) were explored using one-way\nsensitivity analysis, as well as part of the\nprobabilistic sensitivity analysis. \nChanges to the probability of having an eye test\nDeterministic analyses were conducted for the\nprobability of having an eye test with a \ncommunity optometrist assuming low, medium\nand high uptake rates. These were defined as \nan annual probability of an eye test of 2%, 13%\nand 37%. The rationale for these figures was \nbased on discussion among the members of the\nstudy steering group. It was agreed that it was\nlikely that a part of the population would have\nlower utilisation (caused by either lower access \nor the exercise of choice) to a community\noptometrist test. Moreover, some people may \nhave almost no access to these services. The \nvalues adopted would give approximately 10%,\n50% and 90% of the cohort receiving an eye \ntest in the community setting over a 5-year \nperiod.\nChanges to the sensitivity and specificity of the\ntechnician tests\nIn the base-case analysis it was assumed that the\nsensitivity and specificity of this test was 0.8 and\n0.8. In this sensitivity analysis the sensitivity and\nspecificity were varied between plausible ranges of\n0.5 to 1.0 for sensitivity and 0.8 to 1.0 for\nspecificity. \nFurther targeted sensitivity analyses for\npotentially cost-effective scenarios\nFurther sensitivity analyses were carried out for\nthe combinations of the cohort, prevalence rate\nand screening interval that seemed to be most\nlikely to be cost-effective. Specifically, the \nfollowing sensitivity analyses were conducted for\nthe 40-year-old cohort, at a 5% (except where\notherwise stated) OAG prevalence rate and a 10-\nyear screening interval. \nChanges to the uptake of the community\noptometrist\nIt is likely that the cohort of individuals with\nhigher OAG prevalence rates would have a higher\nprobability of going for an eye test, for example\npeople with a family history of OAG or people\nwith myopia. Conversely, ethnic minority groups\nmay have a lower probability of attending for an\neye test. Additional sensitivity analysis was\ncompleted assuming 1.5 times and twice the\nprobability of having an eye test for the \nno-screening strategy. \nChanges to incidence and progression of\nglaucoma\nAlthough considerable efforts were made to\nidentify the estimates for incidence and\nprogression, few data were available. Within the\nbase-case analysis distributions were defined to\nreflect the variability surrounding these estimates.\nDespite this it was felt possible that the values\nused might have been substantially lower or\nhigher than those used in the base case. In the\nfirst of these sensitivity analyses the incidence of\nOAG was assumed to be equal to the maximum\nfor incidence reported in Table 39. A triangular\ndistribution was attached, where the maximum was\nassumed to be twice the maximum used in the\nbase case (truncated if necessary at 1) and the\nminimum value was assumed to be equal to the\nlikeliest value from the base case. \nFor the second of these analyses the incidence of\nOAG was assumed to be equal to the minimum for\nincidence reported in Table 39. A triangular\ndistribution was attached, where the maximum was\nassumed to be the likeliest value from the base\ncase (truncated if necessary at 1) and the\nminimum value was assumed to be equal to zero. \nWith respect to progression in the \u2018high\u2019 analyses,\nthe maximum values for the rates of progression\nwere used. Likewise, in the \u2018low\u2019 analyses, the\nminimum values for the rates of progression were\nused. A triangular distribution around the likeliest\nvalues used in the analyses was defined using the\nsame methods as described above. \nFurther sensitivity analysis was carried out based\non time to progression, rather than average risk \nof progression (Chapter 7), for untreated patients\nfor each corresponding glaucoma state by\napplying the treatment effect of 0.65 to the\nnumber of years until progression occurred. Using\nEconomic analysis\n114this method the progression rates for the\nuntreated were 0.31 for progression to glaucoma\nmoderate, 0.11 for progression to glaucoma severe\nand 0.09 for progression to visually impaired.\nTriangular distributions were attached to these\nparameters\u2019 mean values using the same\nmethodology described above. \nChanges to the sensitivity and specificity of the\ntechnician tests\nIn this sensitivity analysis the same methods as\ndescribed in the section \u2018Base-case and sensitivity\nanalysis\u2019 (p. 113) were used to explore how the\nresults changed as the sensitivity and specificity \nof the second test performed by the technician \nin the \u2018technician screening\u2019 strategy were\nchanged. \nSensitivity analysis on health state utilities\nIn previous analyses health state utilities were\nbased on objective assessment of the severity of\nOAG. In this sensitivity analysis a larger data set\nwhere the severity of OAG was based on the\nsubjective assessment of severity was used. The\ndata used in this analysis were described in\nAppendix 22. As noted in Appendix 22, objective\nand subjective assessments did not always agree.\nThe main difference between the utility values\nbased on subjective and objective assessments was\nthe difference in utility weights between states. For\nexample, in the base-case analysis, a loss of around\n7% and 5% in quality of life would occur when\nmoving from glaucoma mild to glaucoma\nmoderate and from glaucoma moderate to\nglaucoma severe, respectively. These changes are\napproximately 2.5% and 10%, respectively, for this\nanalysis. \nSensitivity analysis on costs\nCosts of screening, diagnosis and treatment\nAs described in \u2018Parameter estimates used in the\nmodel\u2019 (p. 107), the data available on costs were\nlimited and consideration was given to variations\nin the costs used in the model. In this sensitivity\nanalysis low and high estimates were derived. For\nthe cost of diagnosis by the ophthalmologist low\nand high values were developed using data from\nScotland National Statistics (see Table 42). For\nexample, in this situation, the high value was\nalmost three times the base-case value used. \nThe treatment costs of the different disease states\nwere also varied in a further treatment cost\nscenario. In this scenario the costs for each \ndisease state were assumed to be either half or\ntwice the costs used in the base-case analysis\n(Table 42). \nA third scenario was also considered for sensitivity\nanalysis around cost estimates. In this scenario the\ncosts of the screening invitation and the tests\nperformed during screening were varied. Each\ncost was assumed to be either half or twice the\nvalues used in the base-case analysis (Table 43). \nChanges to the cost of visual impairment\nThe perspective taken for the estimate of costs was\nthat of the NHS. In this sensitivity analysis the\neffect of widening the perspective to include other\nsectors of the economy such as Personal Social\nServices and the patient was explored. The effect\nof this wider perspective was assumed to affect the\ncosts of visual impairment alone. This analysis was\nconducted for a 40-year-old cohort undergoing\nscreening every 10 years, but with a prevalence of\nOAG of either 1% or 5%. For both prevalence\nrates one-way sensitivity analysis was used to\nidentify threshold values for the annual cost of\nvisual impairment. To interpret these thresholds it\nshould be borne in mind that, based on the data\nreported by Meads and Hyde,299 the annual cost\nof a year of visual impairment can be calculated as\n\u00a37851 for the first year of visual impairment and\n\u00a37657 for subsequent years (details as to how\nthese estimates were derived are described in\nAppendix 24).\nResults of base-case analysis and\nsensitivity analysis on the base case\nEstimates of costs and QALYs for the base case \nTables 46\u201348 report the estimated relative cost-\neffectiveness by screening strategy at different\nlevels of prevalence of OAG for cohorts aged 40,\n60 and 75 years, respectively. These results are\nbased on a screening interval of 3 years.\nIn each of these analyses, as prevalence increases\ncost also increases and QALYs fall for all three\nstrategies and all age cohorts. Costs increase as\nprevalence increases because a larger proportion\nof individuals in the cohort incurs the costs of\ndiagnosis and the continuing costs of treating the\nOAG. The mean cost per person is higher for the\n40-year-old cohort than the older cohorts because\nthey are less likely to die during the time-horizon\nof the model and thus have more opportunity to\nincur costs. Estimated mean QALYs fall as\nprevalence increases. This is because a greater\nproportion of the cohort experience the adverse\nhealth effects of OAG. Estimated mean QALYs are\ngreater for the younger age group than the older\nage groups at each prevalence level, primarily\nbecause members of the younger age group are\nless likely to die during the time-horizon of the\nmodel.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n115\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

Adopting a strategy \nwhere a technician performs the initial screening\ntests is more effective but more costly than a \nno-screening strategy, and a strategy of screening\nby a glaucoma optometrist is more effective but\nmore costly than the \u2018technician\u2019 screening\nstrategy.\nEstimated cost-effectiveness\nFor each age group considered the incremental\ncost per QALY gained from adopting \u2018technician\u2019\nscreening compared with \u2018no screening\u2019 falls as\nprevalence increases. The incremental cost per\nQALY gained indicates how well the extra costs of\na more expensive but more effective treatment are\nconverted into additional benefits. As the\nincremental cost per QALY gained falls the more\nlikely it becomes that technician screening will be\nconsidered cost-effective compared with no\nscreening. Similarly, for each age group\nconsidered, the incremental cost per QALY gained\nfrom adopting glaucoma optometrist screening\ncompared with technician screening falls as\nprevalence increases. This indicates that as\nprevalence increases it is more likely that\ntechnician screening will be considered cost-\neffective compared with no screening.\nEconomic analysis\n116\nTABLE 46 Incremental cost-effectiveness for the 40-year-old cohort by different prevalence rates\nPrevalence Strategy Cost (\u00a3) QALYs ICER\n1% No screening 257.40 19.231\nTechnician 520.36 19.233 107,938\nGO 617.34 19.234 398,881\n2% No screening 333.89 19.166\nTechnician 608.76 19.170 65,924\nGO 705.86 19.171 240,717\n4% No screening 486.85 19.036\nTechnician 785.57 19.044 39,118\nGO 882.89 19.045 134,460\n6% No screening 639.82 18.906\nTechnician 962.38 18.918 29,051\nGO 1,059.93 18.919 93,416\n8% No screening 792.79 18.777\nTechnician 1,139.19 18.791 23,775\nGO 1,236.97 18.793 71,648\n10% No screening 945.76 18.647\nTechnician 1,316.00 18.665 20,527\nGO 1,414.00 18.667 58,158\n12% No screening 1,098.72 18.517\nTechnician 1,492.80 18.539 18,326\nGO 1,591.04 18.541 48,979\n14% No screening 1,251.69 18.387\nTechnician 1,669.61 18.412 16,737\nGO 1,768.07 18.415 42,330\n16% No screening 1,404.66 18.258\nTechnician 1,846.42 18.286 15,535\nGO 1,945.11 18.289 37,290\n18% No screening 1,557.63 18.128\nTechnician 2,023.23 18.160 14,594\nGO 2,122.15 18.163 33,339\n20% No screening 1,710.59 17.998\nTechnician 2,200.04 18.033 13,838\nGO 2,299.18 18.037 30,159\nGO, \u2018glaucoma optometrist\u2019 strategy.The base-case model suggests that for a \n40-year-old cohort a technician screening strategy\ncompared with a no-screening strategy is\nassociated with an incremental cost per QALY that\nsociety might be willing to pay at a prevalence\nsomewhere between approximately 6 and 10%\n(Table 46).

For the 40-year-old cohort, adopting the\ntechnician strategy in preference to a no-screening\nstrategy would be associated with an incremental\ncost per QALY that society might consider\nacceptable at a prevalence of approximately 4% \n(5-year screening interval) and just less than 4%\n(10-year screening interval). Furthermore, at a\nprevalence of approximately 12% adopting the\nscreening by a glaucoma optometrist would be\nassociated with an incremental cost per QALY that\nsociety might consider acceptable. For the \n60-year-old age group similar prevalences for the\ncost-effectiveness of technician screening are 8% \n(5-year screening interval) and 6% (10-year\nscreening interval). Screening by a glaucoma\noptometrist would be associated with an\nincremental cost per QALY that society might\nconsider acceptable at approximately 20%\nprevalence. At none of the screening intervals or\nprevalences considered for 75 year olds would\neither technician screening or the screening by the\nglaucoma optometrist be considered cost-effective.\nFigures 40\u201342 do not reflect the statistical\nimprecision surrounding the parameter estimates\nused in the calculation of the estimates of the\nincremental cost per QALY gained.

Again, the likelihood of the glaucoma\noptometrist strategy being cost-effective is rarely\ngreater than 20%.\nChanges in the probability of having an eye test\nwith a community optometrist\nIt was discussed and agreed in the steering group\nmeeting that part of the population would have a\nlower attendance for a sight test by a community\noptometrist. In this analysis 2%, 13% and 37%\ncommunity optometrist test uptake rates were\nassumed. The rationale for these figures was that\nthey would result in about 10%, 50% and 90% of\nthe cohort having an eye test in 5 years\u2019 time.\nTables 55\u201357 show the results for the 40-, 60- and\n75-year-old cohorts, respectively. As expected, the\ncost and QALY rise when uptake rates for\nattendance at a community optometrist are higher.\nThe higher the uptake rate, the better the no-\nscreening strategy performs. For instance, the\nincremental cost per QALY for a 1% prevalence\nrate of OAG for the comparison of the technician\nwith the no-screening strategy was \u00a3107,938\n(Table 46), whereas the incremental cost per QALY\nwhen there was a low uptake rate of the\ncommunity optometrist was \u00a359,191 (Table 55).\nMoreover, if there is a group of individuals within\nthe cohort that do not access a community\noptometrist service, the screening strategies\nbecome more cost-effective the bigger the\ndeprived group is. The assumption within the\nmodel is that this group will attend screening.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n123\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

Figures 43\u201345 illustrate this. These figures\nshow that as specificity increases the incremental\ncost per QALY of the technician testing strategy\nfalls. Likewise, as sensitivity increases the\nincremental cost also falls. The figures also\nillustrate that changes in specificity are more\nimportant than changes in sensitivity and that the\nimportance of changes in specificity and sensitivity\ndeclines as prevalence increases. The impact of\nchanges in sensitivity and specificity does not\nappear to be greatly influenced by the age of the\ncohort screened.\nAs would be expected, as the sensitivity and \nthe specificity of tests in the glaucoma \noptometrist strategy were not changed, any\nincrease in the performance of tests performed \nas part of the technician strategy would make \nthe glaucoma optometrist strategy less \ncost-effective compared with the technician\nstrategy. \nResults of further targeted sensitivity\nanalysis\nAs indicated above, the results of the base-case\nanalysis and its associated sensitivity analysis have\nindicated that the following are likely to increase\nthe cost-effectiveness of screening:\n\u25cf starting to screen at a younger age rather than\nan older age (e.g. screening at 40 is more likely\nEconomic analysis\n124\nTABLE 54 Likelihood of a strategy being cost-effective for different age cohorts and screening intervals: 10% prevalence of OAG\nCohort Screening interval Strategy Probabilistic cost-effectiveness for different \nthreshold values for society\u2019s willingness to pay \nfor a QALY (%)\n\u00a310,000 \u00a320,000 \u00a330,000 \u00a350,000\n40 years old 3 years No screening 79.6 48.6 35.0 24.2\n(base case) Technician 19.9 49.6 60.0 62.3\nGO 0.5 1.8 5.0 13.5\n5 years No screening 72.9 42.7 30.1 22.0\nTechnician 26.1 51.4 57.1 53.3\nGO 1.0 5.9 12.8 24.7\n10 years No screening 61.2 36.3 27.7 19.6\nTechnician 36.1 49.8 48.2 39.5\nGO 2.7 13.9 24.1 40.9\n60 years old 3 years No screening 87.6 63.0 48.4 34.3\n(base case) Technician 12.0 35.3 46.7 53.0\nGO 0.4 1.7 4.9 12.7\n5 years No screening 83.0 56.3 43.3 31.7\nTechnician 16.1 39.4 46.7 47.9\nGO 0.9 4.3 10.0 20.4\n10 years No screening 77.5 50.9 38.7 29.1\nTechnician 21.1 39.3 43.1 39.1\nGO 1.4 9.8 18.2 31.8\n75 years old 3 years No screening 95.5 79.3 67.5 50.7\n(base case) Technician 4.3 19.6 30.0 40.0\nGO 0.2 1.1 2.5 9.3\n5 years No screening 93.3 76.0 64.2 48.5\nTechnician 6.4 22.3 30.1 37.6\nGO 0.3 1.7 5.7 13.9\n10 years No screening 90.7 72.0 60.7 45.3\nTechnician 8.7 24.0 29.8 35.6\nGO 0.6 4.0 9.5 19.1\nSee Appendix 23, Figures 80\u201385 for CEACs.Health Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n125\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

In this case, the\ntechnician strategy dominates the no-screening\nstrategy when the annual cost for visual\nimpairment is around \u00a316,000. The cost of visual\nimpairment would need to be \u00a38800 for the\nincremental cost per QALY for the technician\ncompared with the no-screening strategy to be\n\u00a330,000. The glaucoma optometrist strategy\nwould dominate the technician strategy at high\nvalues of annual cost for visual impairment (e.g.\nover \u00a359,000; not shown) and it needs the annual\ncost of visual impairment to be greater than\n\u00a340,000 for the incremental cost per QALY to be\n\u00a330,000 or less.\nWhen the prevalence of OAG is changed to 5%\nand the annual costs of visual impairment are\napproximately \u00a35700 and \u00a315,000, the technician\nstrategy dominates the no-screening strategy, and\nglaucoma optometrist dominates the technician\nstrategy, respectively (Figure 48). \nDiscussion\nAt the beginning of this chapter, the paucity and\nlimitations of existing evidence on the cost-\neffectiveness of screening for OAG were\nhighlighted. Only one previous study was\nidentified that attempted to compare an active\nscreening strategy with current practice.281 This\nstudy concluded that screening for OAG was not\ncost-effective. In the economic evaluation reported\nin this section some evidence has been provided\nthat screening might be cost-effective for selected\nat-risk subgroups. It is, however, supportive of the\nearlier study in that screening at prevalence levels\nlikely to be seen in the general population is\nunlikely to be cost-effective. The results presented\nin the analysis do not address precisely for which\nspecific cohorts of individuals screening might be\nconsidered as cost-effective; this will be considered\nlater. \nThe evidence on cost-effectiveness should be\ntreated cautiously. In part, this is due to the\ninherent problems in combining data, even when\nthey have been systematically assembled, from\nmultiple sources. Caution must also be exercised\nas it is currently unknown whether any of the\nparameter estimates (e.g. uptake of screening,\ndiagnostic performance, disease progression,\nEconomic analysis\n132\n\u201380\n\u201360\n\u201340\n\u201320\n20\n40\n60\nV\na\nl\nu\ne\n \no\nf\n \nI\nC\nE\nR\n \n(\n2\n0\n0\n6\n \n0\n0\n0\ns\n\u00a3\n \np\ne\nr\n \na\nd\nd\ni\nt\ni\no\nn\na\nl\n \nQ\nA\nL\nY\n)\n0\n0 5 10 15 20\nGO dominates \ntechnician strategy\nTechnician dominates\nno screening\nAnnual cost of visual impairment (000s)\nTechnician vs no screening GO vs technician\nFIGURE 48 Value of ICERs for alternative visually impaired annual costs: 40-year-old cohort, 10-year screening interval, 5% OAG\nprevalence ratetreatment effectiveness, costs or utilities) would be\napplicable to any of the groups for which the\nmodel provides some evidence that screening\nmight possibly be cost-effective. Nevertheless,\ndespite the limitations of the analysis, the results\nindicate some patient groups where the\norganisation of a screening service might be given\nfurther consideration. In situations where it may\nbe feasible to organise a service for the target\npatient group, further primary research on the\neffectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening for\nOAG would be required. \nAs described in the section \u2018Results of further\ntargeted sensitivity analysis\u2019 (p. 124), a\nprobabilistic sensitivity analysis has been\nconducted to address the statistical imprecision\nsurrounding the point estimates used within the\nmodel. In this analysis each parameter estimate\nhas an associated statistical distribution which\nprovides information on the likelihood of the\nparameter estimate taking any particular value.\nThe type of distribution for each parameter is\nitself a cause of some uncertainty for any economic\nevaluation. In this study the type of distribution\nvaried by parameter, but was consistent with prior\nexperience about which type of distribution would\nbe appropriate for the type and nature of the data\navailable.91,300 Despite these efforts, the precise\ndefinition of parameter distributions for some\nvariables was limited, as in some cases it was\ndifficult to fit a distribution to the few data\navailable. \nFurther strengths and limitations of many of the\nparameter estimates have been expanded upon in\nthe preceding chapters. These issues do not need\nto be reiterated, except to emphasise that any\nlimitations identified in earlier chapters are equally\napplicable when these data are used for the\neconomic model. An assumption of the model is\nthat no one in the cohorts is receiving treatment\nprior to screening or opportunistic case detection.\nRelaxing this assumption would result in screening\nbeing less likely to be considered cost-effective.\nThis is because the number of cases of OAG who\ncould potentially benefit from screening would be\nreduced. It is also possible that screening might\nidentify people for whom it is recommended that\ntreatment should be stopped, but who subsequently\ngo on to develop glaucoma; the net effect is\nunclear. Two sets of variables that were not the\nfocus of previous chapters are costs and utilities.\nOnly very limited data on the costs of diagnosis\nand treatment were available, and although efforts\nwere made to identify the best data applicable to\nthe UK these are sparse. The model estimates\nwould be more robust if further data were to\nbecome available and consideration should be\ngiven as to whether further primary research is\nneeded. The model also proved to be very sensitive\nto the costs assumed for visual impairment. In the\nbase-case analysis the perspective taken for the\nassessment of costs was the NHS. In a threshold\nanalysis the effect of considering those costs that\nfall on other groups was also considered. The\ninclusion of these costs improves the cost-\neffectiveness of the screening strategies and the\nthresholds identified are not dissimilar to the\nannual costs of visual impairment estimated by\nMeads and Hyde,299 whose data suggest an annual\ncost of visual impairment of approximately \u00a37900\nfor the first year of visual impairment and \u00a37700\nfor subsequent years (see Appendix 24 for details). \nData with respect to health state utilities were also\nvery sparse. Few data reporting utilities were\navailable from the literature and none was\navailable for a UK population. This problem was\nanticipated at the outset of the study and data\nwere collected using the EQ-5D questionnaire\nfrom a sample of people with glaucoma as part of\nanother ongoing study (Kilonzo M, University of\nAberdeen: personal communication, 2006). These\ndata, however, were not specific to people with\nOAG and the sample included some people with\nother forms of glaucoma. Nevertheless, these data\nwere used as it was felt that the impact on quality\nof life of the different types of glaucoma would be\nsimilar. The data used to provide utilities data\nwere collected from respondents with a mean age\nbetween 69 and 70 years. It is unclear how these\nutilities might vary for lower age groups. As a\nconsequence, it is not clear whether the results of\nthe model would be influenced by utility data from\na younger age group. It should also be noted that\nfor the purposes of decision-making it has been\nargued that utilities reflecting the preferences of\nthe general population rather than a specific\nsubgroup (e.g. by age or presence of OAG) should\nbe used.\nOf greater concern is that these utilities are based\non people receiving treatment. Utility data are not\navailable for untreated glaucoma cases. In the\nanalysis it has been assumed that the utility\nassociated with treated and untreated glaucoma is\nthe same. This is justifiable in the sense that\ntreatment does not remove the symptoms of\nglaucoma. However, this approach fails to reflect\nany loss of utility associated with the side-effects of\ntreatment. Ideally, further data should be collected\nin people whose glaucoma has not progressed,\nboth before and after treatment has started. This\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n133\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.would allow the impact and importance of side-\neffects of treatment to be determined.\nThe quality and usefulness of the economic model\nis dependent not only on the quality of the data,\nbut also on the way in which the data are used.\nThe data requirements and the use of the data\nwere determined by the structure adopted for the\nmodel. The development of the economic model\nwas, as described in Chapter 4, based on\ndiscussions with a number of key stakeholders. It\nthen underwent a prolonged period of refinement\nduring which the care pathways were critically\nexamined and refined. The model structure\napplies to a UK context, and may not be relevant\nto other country settings, although other strategies\ncould be developed and readily added to the\nmodel. As described in Chapter 4, the model\nstructure was developed so that the assumptions\nmade in the base-case analysis could be explored\nin future work. For example, in the base-case\nanalysis it was assumed that the ophthalmologist\nwould make a perfect diagnosis. The model\nstructure has allowed for the possibility that this\nwill not be the case and that the ophthalmologist\nmight possibly initiate treatment when it is not\nrequired (a false positive) and fail to diagnose\nsome cases of OAG (a false negative). Nonetheless,\nsince the test characteristics of the diagnostic tests\nwere all based on the assumption that\nophthalmologist assessment is the gold standard,\nthe sensitivity and specificity of those tests should\nbe adjusted for the fact that they are based on an\nimperfect gold standard. It should be mentioned\nthat it is not possible to do this unless there is\nanother gold standard to get all tests\u2019 sensitivity\nand specificity (and ophthalmologist assessment)\nadjusted for. The model is a simplification of the\ncare pathways that may follow. For example, the\ndiagnostic performance of the tests performed by\nthe glaucoma optometrist has been represented by\na single value for sensitivity and specificity of a\ntest. In reality, a battery of tests would be\nperformed, each with its own values for sensitivity\nand specificity. This simplification was made as\nthere is a plethora of tests that may be used and\nthe values for sensitivity and specificity used in the\nmodel appeared to be consistent with the\nestimates from the literature. A second\nsimplification made in the model was the relatively\nsmall number of stages used to reflect the\nprogression of this chronic condition. This\nassumption may fail to represent the subtleties of\ndisease progression. Owing to limitations of the\nprimary data, estimates of the risk of progression\nbetween health states are based on data from one\neye, and do not necessarily represent the\ndefinition of the heath states in the model, which\nis based on binocular visual field loss. This is a\nlimitation as the second eye may not have such\nadvanced disease as the study eye so may be\noverestimated, but equally studies may have used\nthe better eye for analysis and may underestimate\nthe risk of progressive binocular visual field loss.\nFurthermore, there were insufficient data to\ndetermine whether many of the parameter values\nvaried between the stages of disease, for example\nwhether diagnostic performance of the tests or\nrate of progression would vary by severity of\ndisease. The model was, however, structured in\nsuch a way that should such data become available\nin the future they could be readily incorporated. \nA further simplification in the model structure is\nthat rather than modelling the full variety of\ntreatments available for OAG it has been assumed\nthat the effect of treatment can be represented by\na single relative effect size for treatment compared\nwith no treatment.\nFinally, when interpreting the results of the\neconomic evaluation it should be borne in mind\nthat the estimates of cost-effectiveness relate to a\nmale cohort. Gender-specific data were not\navailable for any of the parameter estimates except\nfor annual all-cause mortality. Had the analysis\nbeen repeated with estimates of female all-cause\nmortality it might be expected that, so long as the\nother parameters are unchanged, screening would\nbe more likely to be considered cost-effective. This\nis because, on average, females have a longer life\nexpectancy and are therefore more likely to gain\nthe benefits from earlier detection of OAG.\nConclusion\nScreening for OAG is associated with an ICER that\nsociety might be willing to pay for particular\ncohorts of patients. A particular cohort of interest\nwas 40 year olds who might be expected to have a\nprevalence of OAG of between 6 and 10%\n(depending on society\u2019s threshold willingness to\npay for a QALY) when screening is conducted at a\n3-year interval. As the screening interval increases\nthe cost-effectiveness of the screening strategies\nimproves. \nThe results should be treated with some caution\nand further data are required to confirm the\nfindings. Such data relate to both improving the\nestimates available for some of the parameters in\nthe model, and also from a well-designed controlled\nstudy comparing viable screening strategies in the\ncohorts of patients for whom this research has\nindicated that screening may be cost-effective.\nEconomic analysis\n134Potentially relevant target groups\nfor screening\nThe results of the economic evaluation reported in\nChapter 8 suggest that screening is most likely to\nbe cost-effective for people who have a family\nhistory of OAG and people of black ethnicity, with\na 10-year screening interval. Assuming that\nscreening might commence at 40, 50 or 60 years\nof age, Table 63 shows the percentage of people\nfrom the UK population who would be in the\ntarget age, the prevalence of OAG and the\npercentage of these who might be described by the\ntarget risk factors. Although people with myopia\nor diabetes who fall within a similar age range are\nless likely to be considered cost-effective because\nof their lower prevalence of OAG, extending the\ninvitation to screening to them might also be\nconsidered. Table 63 also shows the estimated\nproportions of the population with each of these\nrisk factors. \nEstimating the numbers eligible\nfor screening\nThe numbers of people eligible for screening and\nthe proportions of cases of OAG that might be\nexpected to be included or excluded from the\nscreened populations can be estimated from the\ndata reported in Table 63 (details of how these\nestimates were derived are provided in\nAppendix 25). It could be decided that people of\nblack race and\/or with a family history of OAG are\nthe only groups where the prevalence of OAG is\nsufficiently high to warrant screening. However,\nwhen considering just the first cycle of screening,\nthese groups represent only an estimated 6% of\nthe age cohort for screening starting at 40, 50 or\n60 years of age. Therefore, the majority of the age\ncohort would not be eligible for screening. As a\nconsequence, this strategy would have the chance\nto detect only 21% of all the expected cases in\nthese age cohorts (although this could be as high\nas 29% when the extremes of confidence intervals\nfor prevalence of risk factors and relative risks of\nOAG reported in Table 63 are considered). If the\neligibility criteria were extended to include other\nat-risk groups (e.g. people with myopia or\ndiabetes) then, as myopia is common, screening\nwould cover at most approximately 40% of the \n40-year-old cohort (and 44% and 28% of the 50-\nor 60-year-old cohorts) and would have the chance\nof detecting 58% (although it might be as high as\n85%) of all the expected cases in the 40-year-old\ncohort (similar percentages are 66% and 36% for\nscreening at 50 and 60 years, respectively).\nAlthough the precise way in which a screening\nprogramme might be implemented is unclear,\nover time it might be expected that all those\npeople with the target risk factors would be\neligible for screening. In Table 64 estimates are\nprovided on the basis that screening is limited to\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n135\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

Two sets of\nestimates are provided in this table. The mean\nestimates were derived using the point estimates\nof prevalence and relative risk of OAG along with\nthe information of the percentage of people in the\npopulation with the target risk factors. The high\nestimates combined the upper values from the\n95% confidence intervals for relative risks and\nprevalence of OAG with information on the\npercentage of people in the population with the\ntarget risk factors.\nIf the criteria for screening were extended to\ninclude those with myopia or diabetes then\napproximately 37% of the 100,000 total cohort\nwould be eligible for screening. The screening\nstrategy would also have the chance to detect\napproximately 80% of all the expected cases in the\ntotal cohort. \nWhen considering the data presented in this\nsection it is essential to remember that all the\nestimates presented are associated with\nconsiderable uncertainty. Although they have been\ncalculated using the best available data their\ncalculation has required some very strong\nassumptions to be made. Furthermore, it should\nalso be borne in mind that although a\nconsiderable number of cases of OAG will be\nmissed because they occur in people who are not\npart of the eligible cohort it is still possible that at\nleast some of these cases will be detected within\nthe community by case finding. \nConsideration of screening\nperformance\nPerformance of the strategies in terms\nof diagnosis\nThe relative performance of the screening\nprogrammes considered has been estimated from\nthe economic model reported in the section\n\u2018Economic evaluation of screening for OAG\u2019 \n(p. 106). These estimates have been provided for\nthe comparison of a technician strategy with\ncurrent practice (no-screening strategy) for\n100,000 people with a prevalence of OAG of \n5% at the start of screening (Table 65).\nIn the first year in which a screening programme\nwould be initiated, approximately 0.6% and 3.5%\nof the whole cohort would be referred to the\nophthalmologist with the no-screening strategy\nand technician strategy, respectively. This would\nenable approximately 49% of the total cases of\nOAG within the 100,000 cohort of 40 year olds to\nFactors relevant to the NHS, other sectors of the economy and patients\n136\nTABLE 64 Estimate of the number of people eligible for screening as well as the estimated number of cases in the eligible and\nineligible population\nOverall population figures Mean High\nTotal cohort 100,000 100,000\nEligible cohort (with a risk factor) 6,200 6,200\nNumber eligible with glaucoma 437 437\nNumber with glaucoma in total cohort 2,100 2,500\nCases not called for screening, but may be picked up by case finding 1,663 1,772\nTABLE 65 Performance of the tests in a 100,000 cohort at 5% prevalence of OAGa\nTechnician No screening\n(1) Number of people referred to the ophthalmologist 3,535 611\n(2) Number of cases identified by the ophthalmologist as positive 2,456 376\n(3) Number of cases identified by the ophthalmologist as negative  1,079 235\n(i.e. false positives of screening)\n(4) Of those judged as negative by the ophthalmologist in (3) above this number  464 101\nwill be kept under observation by the ophthalmologist\n(5) Number of true negativesb 93,698 94,542\n(6) Number of false negatives after the first yearb 2,283 4,363\na Numbers presented do not include the 485 people with each strategy who would be expected to die of natural causes\nwithin the first year.\nb Includes people not presenting for screening or to the community optometrist.be detected by the technician strategy compared\nwith approximately 8% with the no-screening\nstrategy (Table 65). It has been assumed within the\nmodel that treatment will be initiated in all these\nindividuals identified by the ophthalmologist as\nhaving OAG and that treatment would slow the\nprogression of the disease (treated cases of OAG\nhave a relative risk of progression of 0.65\ncompared with untreated OAG). \nIn screening strategies not all those referred to the\nophthalmologist would have OAG. Of those\nreferred to the ophthalmologist approximately\n38% and 30% of people would have been\nincorrectly identified as positive for OAG (false\npositives) with the no-screening strategy and\ntechnician strategy, respectively (Table 65). This is\nequivalent to approximately 800 more false\npositives following technician screening. Within the\neconomic evaluation the extra cost of investigating\nthe false positives by the ophthalmologist has been\nconsidered. What has not been considered is the\nanxiety that this may cause to someone who is\nincorrectly identified as having OAG. The\nmagnitude of this effect is uncertain, but in total it\nwill be greater for the technician strategy than for\nthe no-screening strategy.\nOf the people referred to the ophthalmologist as\npositive for OAG but for whom the\nophthalmologist does not make a diagnosis of\nOAG (i.e. false positives), a proportion will still be\nconsidered as at risk and kept under further\nobservation. In the model it has been assumed\nthat these people will be followed up annually for\na maximum of 5 years or until OAG is diagnosed\n(at which point treatment is commenced). Given\nthe assumptions used within the model, in\nparticular the assumption of perfect diagnosis,\nnone of the suspect cases actually has OAG when\nthey start observation. They would, however, have\na chance of developing OAG during the period of\nobservation. Should this happen, the model\nassumptions mean that any new cases of OAG that\ndevelop will be identified (and treated). In the first\nyear of screening approximately 0.4% of people in\nthe technician strategy arm and 0.1% of people in\nthe no-screening strategy arm would go into an\nobservation state (Table 65). \nEven with the unrealistic assumption that the\ndiagnostic performance of the ophthalmologist is\nperfect, these estimates illustrate the number of\npeople who would be held under observation by\nthe ophthalmologist with the technician strategy\n(further details of the numbers of people held in\nan observation state are reported in Appendix 26,\nand further implications to both the NHS and\nthose people considered as suspect are considered\nbelow). \nThe data presented above represent estimates for\nthe first year of screening. In the model used to\nderive these estimates it has been assumed that\nscreening will be repeated every 10 years and that\npeople in both the technician and the no-screening\nstrategy can be identified as having OAG by case\nfinding. Given that a high proportion of the cases\nof OAG is detected in the first year of screening\nwith the technician strategy, the performance of\nthe technician strategy would compare less\nfavourably with the no-screening strategy in\nsubsequent years because there would be fewer\ncases of OAG to detect. Further details of the\nperformance of the alternative strategies over the\nduration of follow-up considered by the economic\nmodel reported in the section \u2018Economic\nevaluation of screening for OAG\u2019 (p. 106) are\nshown in Appendix 27. This appendix reports the\nnumber of people referred to the ophthalmologist,\nthe number of these who are either true or false\npositives and the number of true and false\nnegatives. From these data it is possible to\ncalculate the positive predictive value, the negative\npredictive value and the sensitivity and specificity\nof the strategies for each year of follow-up\n(reported in Appendix 27). Consideration of these\ndata may also help to inform a decision about the\nmaximum age at which screening once initiated\nshould continue (something that the evaluation\nhas not otherwise explicitly considered, but is\nworthy of further consideration).\nInformation on the diagnostic performance\npredicted by the model can also be used to\nprovide estimates of the cost-effectiveness of the\ndifferent strategies in terms of incremental cost\nper case detected. Table 66 reports the average\ncost of diagnosis and probability of correctly\ndetecting OAG over the lifetime of a cohort of \n40-year-old individuals for whom there is a 5%\nprevalence of OAG and for whom screening is\nrepeated every 10 years. Further details of the\nnumber of cases detected for both the technician\nand the no-screening strategy are supplied in\nAppendix 28.\nIn the calculations that form the basis of the data\npresented in Table 66 the cost of ophthalmologists\nhad been omitted. It should be noted that over\nthe remaining lifetime of a 40 year old there is\napproximately a 17.6% chance of seeing an\nophthalmologist with the no-screening strategy\nand a 21.5% chance with the technician strategy.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n137\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.The estimates provided in Table 66 also do not\ninclude cases of OAG that occur among people\nwho are held by the ophthalmologist in\nobservation. Given the assumptions within the\nmodel of perfect diagnosis of OAG by\nophthalmologists, there is only a 6% and an 8%\nchance of a 40-year-old person entering an\nobservation state over their lifetime for the \nno-screening and technician strategy, respectively.\nThe likelihood of OAG being detected in this state\nis equal to the likelihood of a new case of OAG\ndeveloping. \nPerformance of the strategies in terms\nof visual impairment\nOne indication of the importance of detecting\ncases of OAG is to consider both the number of\npeople who enter the state of severe OAG (i.e.\nlosing vision to below the standard required for\ndriving) or visual impairment and the mean time\nspent in these states. Figure 49 describes the\ncumulative number of cases of visual impairment\nthat are predicted by the model to occur over time\nfor both the technician and the no-screening\nstrategy. These estimates are based on a 40-year-\nold cohort which has a 5% prevalence of disease\nand is invited for screening every 10 years. It\nshould be noted that it has been assumed that out\nof a total cohort of 100,000 a small number of\npeople will already be visually impaired. Hence, in\nthe figure the two curves for the number of people\nwith visual impairment cross the x-axis at\napproximately 250 cases. \nIn addition to the estimates of the cumulative\nnumber of people with visual impairment it may\nbe important to consider how long people who\nhave visual impairment spend in this state\n(Table 67). In this table data have also been added\non the number of people with severe OAG, as this\nis the stage where the OAG greatly affects activities\nof daily living (e.g. people may have to give up\ndriving).\nFewer people develop severe OAG with the\ntechnician strategy, but they spend longer in this\nstate compared with the no-screening strategy.\nThis is because cases of severe OAG progress more\nFactors relevant to the NHS, other sectors of the economy and patients\n138\nTABLE 66 Incremental cost per case detected for a 40 year old with a 5% chance of having OAG and assuming a 10-year screening\ninterval\nStrategy Cost (\u00a3) Incremental  Average  Incremental  Incremental \ncost (\u00a3) cases detected cases detected cost per case \ndetected (\u00a3)\nNo screening 123 0.05351\nTechnician 203 80 0.06255 0.0090 8823\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\n3000\n3500\n4000\n4500\n0 1 02 03 04 05 06 0\nN\no\n.\n \no\nf\n \nc\na\ns\ne\ns\n \no\nf\n \nv\ni\ns\nu\na\nl\n \ni\nm\np\na\ni\nr\nm\ne\nn\nt\nTime since first screen (years)\nNo screening\nTechnician\nFIGURE 49 Cumulative number of cases of visual impairment occurring over time for the initial cohort of 100,000rapidly to becoming visually impaired, as is\nindicated by the greater number of people\nbecoming visually impaired with the no-screening\nstrategy (Table 67). \nA consequence of fewer and later cases of visual\nimpairment is that the estimated number of total\nyears spent visually impaired on average is less for\nthe technician strategy than for the no-screening\nstrategy. The average time spent visually impaired\nis on average also less with the technician strategy. \nImplications for service provision\nScreening, at least in the way in which the\nscreening strategies have been defined, is likely to\nresult in significant increases in the workload of\nophthalmology departments. In part, this will be\nbecause more people will be correctly identified as\nhaving OAG. However, ophthalmologists may also\nhave to deal with more people who have been\nreferred to them as being potentially positive.\nOphthalmologist departments may also have an\nincrease in their workload due to the increased\nnumber of people considered as suspect.\nOne aspect of service provision not included in\nthe economic model, which may also be affected\nby a screening strategy, is the provision of services\nto those people who are visually impaired.\nAlthough the costs of these services may fall\noutside the health service (notably local authorities\nand the voluntary sector) they may be of sufficient\nmagnitude to change a decision about the cost-\neffectiveness of screening. Updating the estimates\nfrom Meades and Hyde to 2006 UK pounds gives\na cost of the first year of blindness of \u00a37851 and a\ncost for subsequent years of \u00a37657 (the cost of\nvision aids and rehabilitation were only incurred\nin the first year).299 As illustrated by Figure 48\n(p. 132), this is sufficient for the technician\nstrategy to be considered both less costly and more\neffective (i.e. dominant) compared with no\nscreening for a cohort of 40 year olds with a 5%\nprevalence of OAG. It is not, however, large\nenough for the glaucoma optometrist strategy to\nbe associated with an incremental cost per QALY\nof less than \u00a330,000 when compared with the\ntechnician strategy. It is clear that expanding the\nperspective of costs beyond the NHS will increase\nthe cost associated with visual impairment and\nhence improve the cost-effectiveness of screening.\nHowever, it is unclear whether improvement in\ncost-effectiveness will be of sufficient magnitude\nfor society to consider screening to be worthwhile\nfor older age groups at risk of OAG.\nA further implication for the provision of services\nnot considered by the economic model is the\ncapacity of screening to detect other significant\neye disease. Such disease may be identified either\nby the community or glaucoma optometrists, or by\nthe ophthalmologist. Given the potentially larger\nnumbers of people seen by these groups of\nhealthcare professionals within the technician\nstrategy, it might be expected that more cases of\nother significant eye disease will be detected\ncompared with the no-screening strategy. Should\nthis occur there would be a consequent increase in\nworkload and healthcare costs in order to manage\nthese conditions (as well as, hopefully, an\nimprovement in health).\nImplications for patients and their\nfamilies\nThe economic model has not taken into account a\nnumber of intangible benefits and disbenefits\nassociated with the process of diagnosing OAG.\nThese benefits and disbenefits may include\nanxiety following either a true or a false positive,\nreassurance following a true negative and the\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n139\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

Glaucoma blindness\nis particularly disabling as navigational vision is\nimpaired and severely restricts independent\nmobility and the ability to self-care.\nThe major risk factor for developing glaucoma\nblindness is late presentation with advanced\ndisease. Currently, an estimated 67% of cases of\nOAG are undetected by the current practice of\nopportunistic case finding. Thus, it is likely that\nimproving detection strategies for population\ngroups at risk of sight-threatening OAG would\nreduce the incidence of visual impairment due to\nOAG. This review has addressed whether a\nscreening programme for OAG is effective and\ncost-effective in preventing severe disease and\nvisual impairment. Severe disease refers to\nsufficient visual loss such that one is not able to\ndrive, and visual impairment means being blind\nor partially sighted.\nBest estimates suggest that 3108\u20133138 people\naged over 50 years were newly registered with\nvisual impairment (blind and partial sight) due to\nglaucoma in England and Scotland in 2002\/03. Of\nthese, at least 1192 new registrations were due\nto OAG as the main cause, but the true number\nmay be higher than this, as some OAG cases\nwould have been registered as glaucoma \nnon-specified.\nCriterion met?

Further research is\nrequired to quantify these risks at different ages.\nIn early glaucoma, structural changes at the optic\nnerve may precede functional visual loss and this\npotentially identifies a latent period before\nglaucomatous visual field loss. The visual loss in\nearly glaucoma is in the mid-peripheral field of\nvision and individuals may not perceive a visual\ndifficulty or incorrectly attribute symptoms to a\nnormal ageing process. In the late stages of\ndisease the visual field loss impacts on central\nvision and reduces HRQoL.

The evaluation has\nidentified certain target groups (black ethnicity,\nfamily history of OAG in a first-degree relative)\nwhere screening may be cost-effective. Other\ngroups at risk are people with myopia and\ndiabetes, but the prevalence is lower and it is\nunlikely to be cost-effective to screen these \ngroups.\nThe economic evaluation has identified how a\nscreening service might be organised in that a\ntechnology-based screening test for OAG is more\ncost-effective than a full ophthalmic assessment by\na specialist optometrist.

However, if\na societal perspective on the costs of visual\nimpairment is taken screening is more likely to be\nconsidered cost-effective. Measures to identify\nsystematically those at risk and quality assure the\nprogramme would be required. Adequate service\nprovision for the screen positives would need to be\nestablished. \nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n147\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.Main results\nThe purpose of this evaluation was to assess\nwhether screening for OAG met the UK NSC\ncriteria for a screening programme. In the absence\nof any evidence from RCTs of screening, a Markov\nmodelling approach was used, informed by a\nseries of systematic reviews, which compared the\nclinical and cost-effectiveness of screening for\nOAG with the current practice of case finding.\nGiven the perspective of the analysis, the data on\nthe effectiveness and more especially the cost-\neffectiveness may be of limited transferability to\nother countries.\nAn evaluation against the NSC criteria was a\nvaluable tool to identify areas where the evidence\nwas inadequate to make a judgement on whether a\nscreening programme should be initiated.\nScreening for OAG met the criteria regarding the\ncondition and the treatment, but did not meet\nmost of the criteria for the test or a screening\nprogramme. \nScreening using a strategy of inviting the at-risk\ncohort to a primary care setting for a measure of\nIOP, and a second test for people with IOP below\n26 mmHg (the technician strategy), was more\neffective but more costly than a no-screening\nstrategy. Screening by invitation to attend a highly\ntrained optometrist for an ophthalmic assessment\nwas more effective but more costly than the\ntechnician screening strategy. The main\ndeterminant of cost-effectiveness was the\nprevalence of disease: the higher the prevalence\nthe more likely screening would be cost-effective.\nWith screening, fewer people become visually\nimpaired (defined as partial sight and blind) and\nspend less time with visual impairment. Likewise,\nfewer people lose vision to below driving standard,\nalthough with screening, time spent in this severe\nstate is longer, as progression to the state of visual\nimpairment is less likely to occur.\nTaken at face value, the economic evaluation\nsuggests that general population screening for\nOAG is not cost-effective at any age. The\nprevalence level would have to be in the region of\n3\u20134% in 40 year olds with a screening interval of\n10 years to approach what might be considered\ncost-effective. The prevalence of OAG in a \n40-year-old cohort is around 0.3%; at this\nprevalence level there is very little likelihood that\nany screening strategy would be considered cost-\neffective compared with current practice. \nSimilarly, in a 60-year-old cohort the prevalence of\nOAG would have to be about 6% to be considered\ncost-effective at screening intervals of 5 or 10\nyears: the prevalence of OAG in this age group is\nabout 1.4%. \nAn important factor in assessing cost-effectiveness\nwas the cost of visual impairment. The costs of\nvisual impairment in the model were based on\ntreatment costs, from an NHS perspective. If a\nwider societal perspective of costs is taken, then it\nis likely that the NHS cost of visual impairment\nused within the model is an underestimate. This is\nbecause it does not include the costs falling on\nindividuals, carers and society in terms of loss of\nindependence, and the need for social support.\nThe threshold analysis conducted as part of the\neconomic model suggests that, for a 40-year-old\ncohort with a 1% prevalence of OAG, the\ntechnician strategy would be associated with an\nincremental cost per QALY of \u00a330,000 compared\nwith current practice should the annual costs of\nvisual impairment be \u00a38800. This is\napproximately \u00a31000 per year higher than the\nannual cost estimated by Meads and Hyde.299\nShould the prevalence of OAG be 5%, then the\ntechnician strategy would be more effective and\nless costly than current practice if the annual cost\nof visual impairment was \u00a35700 per year.\nRecognising higher personal and societal costs of\nvisual impairment makes screening considerably\nmore likely to be cost-effective even at lower\nprevalence levels.\nThe results of the model indicate that even though\nthe prevalence is lower, screening younger people\nappears to be the more cost-effective option. This\nis because the risk of developing visual disability\nand reduced quality of life is more likely over a\nlonger lifetime. Screening high-risk groups (black\nethnicity and family history) might be worthwhile,\nbut for these groups at 40 years the prevalence of\nOAG is in the region of 1\u20132% and therefore not\nhigh enough to consider screening. At 50 years,\nthe prevalence is higher, estimated as between\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n149\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

The model has not explicitly\nconsidered screening a 50-year-old cohort.\nInterpolating from the results of the model on \n40-year-old and 60-year-old cohorts, one would\npredict that screening every 10 years might be cost-\neffective in a 50-year-old cohort at a prevalence of\n4%. Targeted screening of those groups with the\nhighest risk of having OAG would, however, only\ncover a small proportion (6%) of the population\nand this might be considered unacceptable.\nExtending the target population to include other\nhigher risk groups (myopia and diabetes) would\ngive greater population coverage (37%), but the\nprevalence estimates in 40\u201360 year olds are most\nlikely to be 0.6\u20133.6% and, as such, not sufficiently\nhigh to be considered cost-effective.\nAt the first screen for a cohort with a 5%\nprevalence of OAG, using a technician strategy\ngave a positive predictive value of screening of\n52% compared with 62% for case finding. The\nnegative predictive value was 98% and 96%,\nrespectively. Screening detects more cases, but with\na consequent increase in false-positive referrals,\nwhich has considerable implications for service\nprovision. Initiatives to develop glaucoma care\npathways are underway in the UK,51\u201355,296 and the\nimplications of screening, if it is to be considered,\nwould need to be incorporated into any future\nreconfiguration of eye care services. \nThe only readily identifiable risk factor currently\navailable for inviting people to screening is age. It\nis feasible that specific age cohorts could be\nidentified and invited to complete a questionnaire\nof risk factors, and then at-risk people invited for\nscreening tests. However, self-reporting of risk\nfactors other than ethnicity is likely to be unreliable.\nInviting people with a family history of OAG for\nscreening also poses considerable problems. A\nnational register of all newly diagnosed cases of\nOAG would be required. This should be possible,\nbut the initial costs of setting up this surveillance\nhave not been incorporated into the economic\nmodel. The review has identified that people of\nblack ethnicity have a higher risk of OAG. There\nwere insufficient data to estimate the risk of OAG\nin other ethnic minority groups in the UK.\nRestricting screening to select minority groups is\nlikely to be socially unacceptable. Future research\nshould examine prevalence according to ethnicity\nand the acceptability of offering glaucoma testing\nto only selected at-risk groups. \nIn the absence of screening, an improved\nattendance rate for an eye test among at-risk\ngroups and an improved performance of the\ncommunity optometrist at detecting OAG would\nimprove the effectiveness of current case\ndetection. However, if the improved performance\nof the community optometrist involved an\nincreased cost of providing the eye examination, at\nlevels approaching the cost of a glaucoma\noptometrist test, then improving the performance\nof current practice might not be a cost-effective\napproach to improve case detection. The results of\nthe economic modelling indicate that a\ntechnology-based screening test, rather than\nscreening by a full optometric examination, is\nmore likely to be cost-effective; as only those with\nsuspect pathology go on to a more costly but\neffective full assessment, the feasibility of\nintroducing automated testing into a primary care\nsetting merits consideration. One high-risk group,\nnamely people with diabetes, is already included\nin a screening programme for diabetic\nretinopathy, and this programme could be\nmodified to include testing for glaucoma.\nSimilarly, myopes, another higher risk group, are\nlikely to be attending for eye tests and\nconsideration should be given to improved\nawareness and case detection in these individuals.\nWhen considering interventions to improve uptake\ncurrent eye care services an understanding of the\nbarriers to attendance for eye testing is required.\nImproved communication and awareness\ncampaigns on the importance of attending for\nregular eye examinations would be required to\nimprove uptake. An ongoing study in\nBirmingham, UK,306 is assessing attitudes and\nbeliefs related to eye disease and factors associated\nwith presenting late to the eye-care services. This\nstudy will provide insight and estimates of how\nlikely it is that high-risk groups would attend for\nscreening. \nAssumptions, limitations and\nuncertainties\nA series of systematic reviews was undertaken and\na language restriction was applied (except for the\nreports on effectiveness of screening). This\nrestriction is a potential source of bias; however it\nwas felt that studies reported in English were most\nlikely to be relevant to the UK context. Despite a\nsystematic search of the literature, data on the\nsensitivity and specificity of current optometric\npractice were not identified and assumptions had\nto be made. Data were available on the positive\npredictive value of testing, but details on the\nnumber of false negatives were not reported or,\nDiscussion\n150more likely, the negatives on optometric\nexamination were not assessed by a reference\nstandard to ascertain whether they were true or\nfalse negatives. \nThe decision to use a cut-off of IOP of 26 mmHg\nwas based on expert opinion. Although the IOP\ndistribution in the population is known, the\nsystematic review found only two studies that\nreported the risk of OAG according to IOP in\nnewly detected cases. Although IOP does not\ndefine OAG, a higher risk of progressive disease at\nhigher levels of IOP is reported,25,27 and more\nsevere disease at presentation is associated with\nhigher levels of IOP.28 In the systematic review of\nscreening tests (Chapter 6), there were insufficient\ndata to determine what IOP cut-off would give the\nbest balance between sensitivity and specificity.\nMost studies reported a cut-off of above\n21 mmHg. In the economic model, results from\none population-based study in the USA were used\nto estimate the proportion of people with an IOP\nof 26 mmHg or above who did or did not have\nglaucoma, and similarly for people with an IOP\nbelow 26 mmHg. Data from this study were used\nto create a beta distribution around this estimate\nto reflect its considerable imprecision, but there\nare concerns that these data may not be applicable\nto the UK. The model only looked at two out of\nmany possible screening strategies; in particular\nIOP measurement was used and GAT specified as\npart of the technician-based screening pathway.\nThe model structure is such that other tests of\nIOP, such as NCT, could be considered, and based\non the results of the sensitivity analyses on costs\nand test performance the decision regarding cost-\neffectiveness would not be expected to change.\nWithin the whole economic model-based analyses\nit was assumed that the ophthalmologist\nassessment was the gold standard. In terms of the\nmodel this means that ophthalmologist assessment\nsensitivity and specificity are equal to 1. In other\nwords, these professionals have perfect\ninformation and do not make mistakes in their\npatient management decisions. While this might\nnot be the case, all test characteristics were\ncalculated against ophthalmologist assessment.\nShould this perfect information assumption be\nrelaxed, another reference standard should be\nchosen against which every test sensitivity and\nspecificity within the model, as well as\nophthalmologist assessment, should be tested. \nThe results of the deterministic economic analysis\npresented do not take into account the\nimprecision around the data used to derive\nestimates of cost-effectiveness. This imprecision\nwas reflected in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis\nin the model; it was shown that the prevalence of\nOAG would have to be 5% in a 40-year-old cohort\nfor technician-based screening to have a 55%\nchance of being considered cost-effective. For a\n60-year-old cohort and at this prevalence level the\nmodel suggests that screening is unlikely to be\ncost-effective. \nExtensive sensitivity analyses explored the effects\nof changing the parameter estimates used in the\nmodel. The important drivers of estimates of cost-\neffectiveness were considered to be the attendance\nfor sight tests in current case finding, the rate of\nglaucoma progression, the utility estimates\nassociated with each stage of glaucoma and the\ncosts of visual impairment.\nOne of the findings of the economic model was\nthat more frequent attendance for eye testing in a\nno-screening strategy may affect the cost-\neffectiveness results; this higher rate of attendance\nfor sight testing is likely to apply to people with\nmyopia or diabetes and those aged 50\u201360 years,\nprompted by the need for reading glasses. This\nmay also apply to family members of known cases\nof OAG, as they are more likely to be aware of the\nsignificance of OAG and the risk to vision. Other\nhigh-risk groups may attend less frequently for\nsight testing, making screening more cost-effective,\nalthough it might be expected that such groups\nwould also have a lower uptake of screening. In the\nUK, if an African-derived population were to be\ninvited for screening the attendance could be\nexpected to be as low as 40%.120 In the economic\nmodel an uptake of screening of 78% has been\nassumed, with a minimum of 66% and a maximum\nof 92%. The net effect of lower uptake rates in\nethnic minority groups on the cost-effectiveness of\nscreening is uncertain. \nA sensitivity analysis around screening a \n40-year-old cohort, using a technician-based\nstrategy, at an OAG prevalence of 5% with a\nrescreen every 10 years, found that, as expected,\ncost-effectiveness increased as the sensitivity and\nspecificity of the screening test used in the\ntechnician-based strategy increased. However, the\nsensitivity analysis found that the sensitivity and\nspecificity of the screening test over the ranges\nconsidered did not greatly alter the estimates of\ncost-effectiveness. The specificity of the test does\naffect the impact that screening would have on\ndiagnostic services; a highly specific test is\nrequired to reduce the large numbers of false-\npositive referrals from any of the screening\nstrategies.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n151\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.The systematic review of the accuracy of potential\nscreening tests found that no test, or combination\nof tests, was clearly superior as a screening test.\nFor the potential tests on which data were\navailable, the sensitivity was at least 50%, apart\nfrom IOP measurement, and all tests had\nspecificity above 80%, apart from one test, FDT \nC-20-5, which had a specificity of 75%. There is\nuncertainty around all the estimates as the results\nare based on indirect comparisons and, as such,\nare prone to bias due to differences in the\npopulations studied. In a screening situation it is\nimportant that the majority of people to be\nscreened are able to perform the test and have\nresults that can be read. In general, across all the\ntests 80\u201399% of the people tested were able to\nperform the test adequately. For some tests that\nwere considered as potential candidate tests for\nOAG screening, no studies met the inclusion\ncriteria for the accuracy review. As a result, this\nresearch has not been able to provide estimates for\nthe test accuracy of SLP (the GDx VCC), OCT or\nthe RTA.\nThe review of treatment effectiveness suggests that\nwith treatment at an early stage of disease, the risk\nof progressive visual loss is reduced by\napproximately 35%, delaying time to blindness on\naverage by 12 years. The treatment effect on long-\nterm outcomes may be better or worse than this\naverage effect. There was insufficient evidence to\ndetermine the rate of progression for different\nstages of OAG severity or different at-risk groups,\nand thus the rate of progression in higher risk\ndisease is uncertain. A higher rate of progression\nwould make screening more likely to be\nconsidered cost-effective. \nThere were limited published data for estimating\nthe utility loss associated with different severities of\nOAG.298,307 The populations used in these studies\nwere not necessarily representative of a UK\npopulation, and as a result this evaluation used\nutility estimates as measured by the EQ-5D, in 264\npeople with glaucoma in whom severity was self-\nreported, apart from a subset (63 people) in whom\ndisease severity was validated based on binocular\nvisual field loss. This generic measure of health\nstatus may not adequately capture the utility loss\ndue to glaucoma. However, the generic health state\nutilities were estimated using the EQ-5D based on\nUK population tariffs and such an approach has\nrecently been advocated as being a necessary part\nof the reference case for health technology\nassessments conducted on behalf of NICE.297\nThe utility estimates used in the base case may\nalso be imprecise as they were based on a small\nsample of glaucoma patients with validated disease\nseverity. Using estimates based on the subjective\nassessment of disease severity led to both the\ntechnician and the glaucoma optometrist\nstrategies being more likely to be considered cost-\neffective. For example, the likelihood for the\ntechnician strategy being considered optimal rose\nfrom less than 50% to about 61% and over 70%\nwhen society\u2019s willingness to pay for a QALY was\n\u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000, respectively. \nThe costs of visual impairment in the model were\nbased on treatment costs, from an NHS\nperspective. If a wider perspective of costs is\ntaken, then it is likely that the cost of visual\nimpairment is an underestimate, and does not\nrecognise the cost on individuals, carers and\nsociety in terms of loss of independence, and the\nneed for social support. Recognising higher\npersonal and societal costs of visual impairment\nmakes screening considerably more likely to be\ncost-effective.\nThe model has not taken into account other\npotential benefits of screening for OAG, mainly\nthe possibility of detecting other treatable eye\ndisease. Both screening strategies are likely to\ndetect other eye pathology. This is an additional\nbenefit, but may be a negative consequence of\nscreening in that referrals to ophthalmology\nservices will be increased, and some of these will\nbe false-positive referrals. It is unclear what effect\nthe inclusion of costs and other effects of detecting\nother eye disease would have on the relative cost-\neffectiveness of screening. It might be expected\nthat a glaucoma optometrist strategy would detect\nmore cases of other significant eye disease, but\nwould result in increased costs of diagnosis and\ntreatment. How this might affect the relative cost-\neffectiveness of the \u2018glaucoma optometrist\u2019\nstrategy compared with the \u2018technician\u2019 strategy is\nalso uncertain.\nDiscussion\n152Implications for healthcare\nBased on the available evidence derived from \nthe economic model, population screening of \nage cohorts between 40 and 75 years is not\nconsidered to be cost-effective. The model was\nparticularly sensitive to estimates of prevalence\nand costs of visual impairment. Selective screening\nof groups with higher prevalence, such as those\naged between 50 and 60 years with a family\nhistory of OAG, or of people of black ethnic origin\nmay be worthwhile. Selective screening of these\ngroups covers 6% of the population cohort and\ntherefore would only have the chance to detect\n20\u201330% of all the expected cases in the 50- or \n60-year-old cohorts. Moreover, systematically\nidentifying those at risk is not currently feasible in\nthe UK. \nThe positive predictive value of the more cost-\neffective screening strategy, based on a screening\ntest that does not require skilled interpretation, is\nabout 52%, with a negative predictive value of\n98%, and as such detects more cases but also\nresults in a large number of false-positive referrals.\nThis has implications for the ophthalmology\nservices.\nBased on the results of the model there are two\nstrategies that will improve current case detection,\nnamely improving the attendance rate for eye\nexamination generally, particularly in high-risk\ngroups, and improving the performance of current\noptometric assessment, either by refining\noptometric practice or by adding in a technology-\nbased first assessment, the latter being the more\ncost-effective option. This has implications for any\nfuture organisational changes in community eye-\ncare services in that if, in the absence of screening,\nrecommendations are made to improve case\nfinding, then recommendations that at-risk people\nrequire a full assessment by a specialised\noptometrist may not be the best use of healthcare\nresources, and the feasibility of improving case\ndetection by an initial automated test strategy in a\ncommunity setting should be explored. The\neconomic evaluation suggests that the diagnostic\nskills of the optometrist are best utilised for\npeople testing positive on an initial technology-\nbased examination for OAG. \nThese recommendations that population screening\nis unlikely to be cost-effective are based on the\nresults of an economic model; the parameter\nestimates are associated with considerable\nuncertainty and should be interpreted with\ncaution. In particular, if the rate of progression\nand the costs of visual impairment are higher than\nestimated then screening is more likely to be cost-\neffective. For example, the annual cost of visual\nimpairment would need to be \u00a38800 for the\ntechnician strategy to have an incremental cost per\nQALY of \u00a330,000 for a 40-year-old cohort with a\n1% prevalence of OAG. At a 5% prevalence level\nof OAG, technician screening would be dominant\n(more effective and less costly) when the annual\ncost of visual impairment is \u00a35700 or greater. \nPriorities for further research\nAn RCT of screening is considered to be the\noptimal design to determine the benefits of\nscreening. However, before initiating a trial,\nfurther research should aim to develop and\nprovide quality data to populate the economic\nmodel. The model only considered a limited set of\nscreening and case-finding strategies, and further\nresearch is required to determine what an optimal\nscreening or case-finding strategy could be. \nPriority 1: feasibility of screening strategies\nThis research has several components and would\ninvolve input from qualitative researchers, health\npsychologists, health economists and trialists. The\nmain requirements are:\n\u25cf to establish how the risk groups could be\nidentified; multiple identification strategies\nwould be required according to risk factor\n\u25cf to determine the optimal test strategy in a\ncommunity setting; this study should explore\nhow a technician strategy might be\nincorporated into existing visual assessments,\nfor example, as part of the diabetic retinopathy\nscreening programmes\n\u25cf to explore the acceptability of interventions to\nimprove attendance for glaucoma testing and\nthe acceptability of subsequent testing using\nestablished models of behaviour change from\nhealth psychology\n\u25cf to value any potential harms and benefits\nassociated with screening (or targeted case\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 41\n153\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.\nChapter 12\nConclusionsdetection) by exploring the strength of\npreferences of potential users of the service\nusing established health economics\nmethodology.\nPriority 2: identifying weaknesses in the model,\nand improving parameter estimates\nThere is considerable uncertainty regarding\nparameter estimates used in the model as the\navailable data were considered to be too limited\nand of too poor quality to provide reliable\nestimates. Prospective data collection on the costs\nof detection, management and costs of visual\nimpairment could be collected in the context of\ncurrent service provision. Improved monitoring of\nhealth outcomes in large populations using\nregisters of blindness by cause would provide\nsurveillance for the estimation of the impact of\nprevention strategies over time. Surveillance\nsystems should explicitly consider how to ensure\ncompleteness of ascertainment. Improved\nestimates of health status, both patient reported\nand estimates of the risk of progressive loss of\nvisual function, are required. As further data,\nincluding new information as to how a screening\nstrategy might be organised, become available\nthese should be used to refine the model. \nA value for information analysis is indicated to\ndetermine which data have most impact on the\nmodel results and hence where future primary\nresearch should be directed to inform decision-\nmaking. \nPriority 3: improving uptake of glaucoma testing\nAn RCT of interventions to improve the uptake of\nscreening, or enhanced case detection, informed\nby the results of the prior feasibility studies is\nindicated. \nConclusions\n154W\ne thank members of the steering committee\n(Augusto Azuara-Blanco, John Cairns, Jon\nDeeks, Adrian Grant, Stephen McPherson,\nRichard Wormald, and David Wright) for advice\nand support and Bronwyn Davidson for secretarial\nassistance.
