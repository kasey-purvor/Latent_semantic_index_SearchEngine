INTRODUCTION \n \nConventional detection in CDMA systems, composed of a \nbank of matched filters, suffers from the Multiple Access \nInterference (MAI). Several suboptimum multiuser \ndetectors have been proposed for mitigating. Amongst them \nare linear detectors, like Decorrelator and MMSE. These \nmethods have several attractive properties but suffer from \nimplementation complexity, which is mainly due to a need \nfor inverting a large matrix. Some works are done for \napproximating the inverse matrix without computing \ndirectly [1-3]. For example [3] uses polynomial expansion \n(PE) method. This method is powerful, however needs to \ncalculate a set of coefficients. On the other hand [1] has \nproposed a simplified polynomial-expansion, which \naccording to its inaccurate parameter estimation, the \nconvergence rate is rather slow. There is another issue about \nlinear suboptimum algorithms that there is still a gap \nbetween their performance and the optimum detector. \nOptimum detector relies on exhaustive searches and hence \nimpractical. Designing suboptimum search strategies with \nmoderate level of complexity can fill this gap. This paper \ntackles the above issues by proposing a low complex \nstructure composed of modified suboptimum search \nalgorithm in conjunction with a reduced rank linear (RRL) \nmultiuser detector without a need to matrix inversion. We \nfirst briefly review the system model of CDMA systems in \nsection II. In section III RRL detector is addressed. Section \nIV considers the complexity evaluation of the RRL and the \nFourier algorithm. In section V, the suboptimum search \nalgorithm operating on the output of both conventional and \nRRLG detector is introduced. Power profile of the users in \nthe proposed scheme is also considered and a more simple \nstructure with the almost same performance is achieved. \nThe results are given in section VI. Conclusions are \nsummarized in section VII. \n \nII. SYSTEM MODEL \n \nFirst of all a model for the CDMA systems is needed. The \nreceived signal for a system with K users is: \nr t s t n t\nk\nK\nk k( ) ( ) ( )= \u2212 +\n=\n\u2211\n1\n\u03c4  \n \n(1) \nwhere n(t) is the single source of the channel and sk(t) is the \nreceived signal for the user k and is defined as follow \n  \nkj\nkkkk etbtaPts\n\u03b8)()()( =  (2) \n \nPk, ak(t) and bk(t) are kth user\u2019s power, spreading waveform \nand data waveform respectively. (Both waveforms are \nassumed to be rectangular pulses). \u03b8k is the received phase \nof the kth user relative to some reference phase. \nAfter passing through a bank of matched filters the output of \nthe filters can be shown to be as follows: \n \ny=RAb + n (3) \nwhere R is a matrix with the size of KN KNb b\u00d7  and relates \nto cross-correlation of the spreading waveforms.

Reduced rank linear (RRL) multiuser detector \nusing Taylor series and Gershgorin algorithm \n \nA) Previous research \nBy using the Taylor series, the expansion of R-1 can be \nwritten as [4, 5]: \n\u2211\u221e\n=\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2212=\n0i\n1 )( iRIR 1 \u03b1\u03b1  \n \n(4) \nIf and only if the eigen-values of R satisfy the conditions: \n1)(1 <\u2212 R\u03b1\u03bbi  (5) \nFor a positive subdefinite matrix R, the above condition can \nbe written as: \n)(\n20\nmax R\u03bb\n\u03b1<<  \n \n(6) \nAll of the eigenvalues of R are positive. Based on this fact, \nRef. [1] has derived an approximation for \u03b1 \n)(\n2\nRtrace\n=\u03b1  \n \n(7) \nBecause: \n)()( max RR \u03bb\u03bb >==\u2211\u2211 traceR\ni\nii\ni\ni   (8) \nThough it is not an accurate estimate.  \n \nB) Estimation of parameters based on Rayleigh-Ritz \nTheorem \nIn a general case for the equal power and synchronous \nusers, diagonal elements of R are all 1s and the non- \ndiagonal elements are in the range of, (-\u03b2, +\u03b2), 0< \u03b2 <1, (\u03b2 \nis the maximum value of the cross-correlations). In [4] we \nderived a more precise formula for \u03b1 \n)1(1\n2\n\u2212+\n=\nK\u03b2\u03b1  \n \n(9) \nIn situation when the cross-correlation values are large, \u03b2 \ntakes the maximum value of )1( =\u03b2  and the Eq.(9) \nbecomes equal to Eq.(8), because: \nKRtrace\nK\ni\nii ==\u2211\n=1\n)(R  \n \n(10) \nEq.(10) gives a more accurate estimate for \u03b1 than the one \nobtained from the Eq.(7) and in consequence a faster \nconvergence can be achieved.  \n \nC) Asymptotic approach \nOne of the recent and comprehensive methods for tackling \nthe issue of calculating the coefficients is addressed in [6], \nthat optimises the coefficients by signal to noise ratio \naspects and uses the features of random matrixes and hence \nthey do not encounter the eigenvalues problem. In this \napproach one of the key assumptions is randomness of the \ncross-correlation matrix\u2019s elements. This assumption does \nnot use any more information about the elements and hence \nleads to some inaccuracies. Since the approach is using the \nrandom matrix theories and their theory does not include the \nsparse matrixes, their second assumption is that the users are \nsynchronous because in the asynchronous scenarios the \nmatrices are sparse. These two assumptions confine the \napplicability of their method in the actual systems. The main \nadvantage of their method, however, is that the optimum \nasymptotic weighting coefficients for the early stages of \noperation are obtained in the closed form. \nD) Gershgorin Algorithm \nIn asynchronous systems most of the elements of R are zero \nwhile Eq.(9) considers only the maximum value of non-\ndiagonal elements of R and ignores the majority of elements \nthat are zero. This ignorance decreases the accuracy and \nshows its effect in the convergence rate and the \nperformance. To overcome this problem, we refer to the \nGershgorin theorem in linear algebra [5]. According to this \ntheorem, any eigenvalue of a matrix is located in one of the \nclosed discs of the complex plane centred at aii and having \nradius \u2211\n\u2260ijj\nija\n,\n.  In other words, \n|\u03bbi - aii|  \u2264  \u2211\n\u2260ijj\nija\n,\n  \n(11) \nBy a simple calculation on the elements of R, two \napproximate values can be derived for \u03bbmin(R) and \u03bbmax(R): \n\u03bbmax \u2264   max { aii + \u2211\n\u2260ijj\nija\n,\n}  ; i,j=1,2,...,KNb \n\u03bbmin \u2264   min { aii + \u2211\n\u2260ijj\nija\n,\n} \n \n(12) \n \nThe optimum value of \u03b1 to get the fastest convergence \ndepends on \u03bbmin(R) and \u03bbmax(R) through the following \nequation [9]: \nminmax\n2\n\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 +=opt  \n \n(13) \nUsing Eq.(11, 12, 13), a proper estimate for \u03b1 could be \nderived. \nA comparison between the performances of the above three \nmethods is given in Fig(3).  \n \nIV. COMPLEXITY EVALUATION OF THE RRL AND \nTHE FOURIER ALGORITHM \n \nThere are other methods that have recently been reported in \nthe literature concerning linear interference cancellation. [7] \nhas introduced a method that performs the interference \nsuppression in the frequency domain. They also compare \ntheir method with three other methods (which are based on \nCholesky factorisation, the Levinston algorithm and the \nSchur algorithm) in terms of performance and complexity. \nThe authors of [7] have also provided a program [8] that \ncalculates complexity of their algorithms. Their main \nconclusion about the Fourier algorithm was that it benefits \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on April 19,2010 at 15:23:15 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nfrom a low complexity in terms of floating point operations, \nyet achieves the same performance as the exact Cholesky \nalgorithm. \nThroughout [7], it has been assumed that the spreading \nfactor of the users are equal to 16 and all the complexity \nevaluations have been carried out based on this value. In the \nFDD-WCDMA uplink, the spreading factor of the users is \nin the range of 4-256. We will see in the next section that \nfor high values of the spreading factors, the Fourier \nalgorithm will suffer in complexity comparisons. \nThe details of the complexity evaluations are provided in \n[9]. \nIt should be pointed-out that in the actual systems the \nmatched filtering process would have already been done by \nother subsystems and we can apply our RRL algorithm to \nthe output of matched filters (y) so in the complexity \nevaluation of RRLG-MUD two cases are considered:  \n1) Performing the calculations considering the complexity \nof matched filtering (with y).  \n2) Performing the calculations without considering the \ncomplexity of matched filtering (without y [wo\/y]). \n \nV. SUBOPTIMUM SEARCH ALGORITHM   \n \nOptimum multiuser detection needs a huge number of \nsearches. In the jointly optimum decision, the problem is to \nfind the b, in such a way to maximize [2]: \nHbbAybb TT \u2212=\u2126 2)(   \n(14) \nWhere H is un-normalized cross-correlation matrix: \nH=ARA. The complexity would be exponential in the \nproduct K(2Nb +1).  \nA) Sub optimum search algorithm \nOur suboptimum search algorithm is based on an intuitive \nbehaviour of the primary stage of detection process, this \nsearch uses a sequential strategy.  \nIf the search process starts off from a fair reliable starting \npoint, then the optimum sequence will be in a close \nneighbourhood of the starting point and only few bits in the \nobservation window are in error. Our strategy is to pinpoint \nthese bits by an algorithm. Considering the sequence (b1, b2, \n\u2026, bK) to be the output of the initial stage, based on Eq(14), \ntwo values for \u2126 related to (b1, b2, \u2026, bK) and (-b1, b2, \u2026, \nbK) will be calculated. Among of these two sequences, the \none with greater value for \u2126 will be kept as the more likely \nsequence and the process continues the same way for the \nnext bit. For the second bit, two sequences of (b1, b2, \u2026, bK) \nand (b1, -b2, \u2026, bK) will be in consideration. The length of \nthis process is only dependent on the observation window \nand the number of users. \nB) Modified sub optimum search algorithm \nTo achieve a balance between the complexity and \nperformance, we can confine the sub optimum search to a \npercentage of the users. In this case, after an initial pre-\nprocessing of the users and sorting them based on their  \nStarting off from a \nfairly reliable point for\nA detected bits of length K\nCalculating the Optimum  \ndetector\u2019s Criterion, \u2126 (0)\ni= 1\nChanging the sign of ith bit\nCalculating the Optimum  \ndetector\u2019s Criterion, \u2126 (i)\n\u2126 (i)  (?)  \u2126 (i-1)Keep the change,i=i+1\nD isregard the change\ni= i+1\n> <=\nContinue as i<K\n \nFigure 1.

Power profile extraction of the users \n \npower profile, the search will be carried out on the weakest \nusers in the system. \nThe power profile calculation could be carried out in two \nseparate places in the structure. It could be either before the \ninitial stage of the RRLG or be after initial stage, and before \nthe sub optimum search stage, Figure 1. Power profile \nextraction in the very input of the initial stage has a benefit \nin the actual systems, as they usually have a power control \nunit already in the system and these information will be \nready by that subsystems without introducing any extra \noverhead to the system. However they are not as accurate as \nthe one that calculates the power profile based on the output \nof the RRL detector. These two different approaches have \nbeen compared in the next section and the second one \noutperforms the first one. \nSimulations in the next section show that by confining the \nnumber of weakest users to be 40% of the all users will give \nalmost the same performance. \n \nVI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS \n \nDifferent simulations are carried out which the results are \ngiven as follow: \nFig(3) compares the performance of different RRL detectors \nwith decorrelator and conventional detector. 2 asynchronous \nusers using spreading codes\u2019 crosscorrelations = 0.3, 0.35, \nand 5 stages with three conditions: simple condition Eq.(7), \nmodified condition Eq.(9), the RRLG Eq.(12, 13). One path \nfading-channel is considered. RRLG provides the best \nperformance. \nFig(4) compares RRL detectors with the recent proposed \nasymptotic RRL detector in [6] in the AWGN channel. 10 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on April 19,2010 at 15:23:15 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nsynchronous users are considered. Our detector (RRL) \nachieves the same performance as the actual decorrelator. \nIn Figures 5-9, a WCDMA system, containing 10 users \nusing processing of 16, in Vehicular-A channel, FDD-\nUplink is considered.  \nFig(5) shows the RRLG performance operating in multiple \nstages. It achieves the majority of its gain in 3 stages. \nFig(6) shows the performance of the suboptimum search \nalgorithm operating on the output of the RRLG detector \nintroduced in section III. The detector outperforms the PPIC \ndetector even in the low Eb\/No (in the region of 5-10 dB), \nwhich is important in the actual systems. \nPerformances of the search algorithm with consideration of \nthe weakest user (smart search) is shown on Fig(7). Note \nthat the smart search in this figure is 10 times less complex \nthan the sub optimum normal search, as the number of users \nis 10.Fig(8) shows the effect of the number of the weakest \nusers considered in the search algorithm. Only 5 users give \nperformance almost the same as the total number of users. \nConfining the search process to 4 users seems satisfactory, \nwhich means 60% reduction in complexity. \nFig(9) compares the performance of the 4 weakest users \nobtained in two different stages:  \na) SINR estimated at output of matched filters (input to \ninitial stage of RRLG)  \nb) SINR estimated at output of initial stage of RRLG (input \nto suboptimum search algorithm)  \nIt is well shown that estimation of the powers using scheme \n(b) outperforms the one estimated by (a). This behaviour \nbecomes clearer in the high interference regimes. \nThe complexity evaluations of RRLG and the Fourier \nalgorithm are depicted on Figures 10 and 11. For calculating \nthe operations involved in the Fourier algorithm we have \nused the program presented in [8]. In the Fourier algorithm \nthe FFT length of D=32 was considered. 12 users are \nconsidered and the maximum channel impulse response is \n57 chips. \nFigure 10 shows the comparison of two methods and the \neffect of the number of receiver antennas on the \ncomplexities. In this simulation a large value for the \nspreading factor is considered (128). As can be seen, for \nlarge values of spreading factor, the Fourier algorithm \nsuffers from the complexity. As shown in the graph, this \nbehaviour can be magnified as the number of the received \nantennas increases. The effect of the spreading factor is \nshown in Figure 11. As the spreading factor varies, the \nnumber of bits that each user transmits (Nb), varies, because \nfor the FDD-WCDMA uplink in each slot (Spreading factor \n* Number of transmitted bits Nb)=2560 remains the same. It \ncan easily be seen that for large values of the spreading \nfactor, the complexity of the Fourier algorithm is high, \nhowever in low spreading factors its complexity is much \nbetter than other schemes. In this simulation, one antenna is \nconsidered. The reason for this behaviour in the complexity \ncan be described as follow: \nAs RRLG operations are performed on the output of \nmatched filters (y), there is no dependency on the spreading \nfactor anymore. In the situations that large values of \nspreading factor are considered, this will avoid the \ncomplexity to increase a lot. On the other hand in the \nFourier algorithm the main operations are carried out at the \nreceived signal and depend on the spreading factor and \nhence by increasing the value of spreading factor the \ncomplexity increases a lot. \n \nVII. CONCLUSIONS \n \nA low complex structure composed of suboptimum search \nalgorithm in conjunction with a reduced rank linear \nmultiuser detector for the mobile uplink was proposed. \nLooking analytically on the convergence conditions of the \ninitial stage, a modification was applied that apart from its \nsimplicity had an improved performance. Its complexity \nwas also compared to the recently proposed Fourier method. \nThe suboptimum search algorithm was using a sequential \nmethod and did not have a high degree of complexity. Both \nsearch algorithm and primary stage were using similar \ninformation that avoided unnecessary extra calculations. \nPower profile of the users was also considered in the search \nalgorithm and by sacrificing a little amount of performance \nthe complexity was even more reduced. The techniques are \nlow complex and operate on the canonical formulation of \nthe systems, which in consequence become suitable for \nimplementation and applicable in MC-CDMA and MIMO \nsystems. Several simulations were carried out for evaluating \nthe performances. They were also compared to partial \nparallel interference cancellation method. \n \nREFERENCES  \n [1] Lei Z.D., Lim T.J., \u201cSimplified Polynomial-Expansion linear \nDetectors for DS-CDMA Systems\u201d, IEE Electronic Letters, Vol. \n34, No. 16, pp.1561-1563, Aug. 1998 \n[2] Verdu S., \u201dMulti-user Detection\u201d, Cambridge university \npress,1998 \n[3] Moshavi, S., Kanterakis, E.G., and Schilling, D.L.: \u201d Multi-\nstage linear receivers for DS-CDMA systems\u201d, Int.
