The advance of a glacier over a deforming sed-\niment layer is analysed numerically. We treat this problem\nas a contact problem involving two slowly-deforming vis-\ncous bodies. The surface evolution of the two bodies, and\nof the contact interface between them, is followed through\ntime. Using various different non-linear till rheologies, we\nshow how the mode of advance depends on the relative effec-\ntive viscosities of ice and till. Three modes of advances are\nobserved: (1) overriding, where the glacier advances through\nice deformation only and without deforming the sediment;\n(2) plug-flow, where the sediment is strongly deformed, the\nice moves forward as a block and a bulge is built in front of\nthe glacier; and (3) mixed-flow, where the glacier advances\nthrough both ice and sediment deformation. For the cases\nof both overriding and mixed-flow, an inverse depth-age re-\nlationship within the ice is obtained. A series of model ex-\nperiments show the contrast in effective viscosity between\nice and till to be the single most important model parame-\nter defining the mode of advance and the resulting thickness\ndistribution of the till. Our model experiments indicate that\nthe thickness of the deforming till layer is greatest close to\nthe glacier front. Measurements of till thickness taken in\nsuch locations may not be representative of deforming till\nthickness elsewhere. Given sufficiently large contrast in ef-\nfective viscosity between ice and till, a sediment bulge is\nformed in front of the glacier. During glacier advance, the\nbulge quickly reaches a steady state form strongly resem-\nbling single-crested push moraines. Inspection of particle\npaths within the sediment bulge, shows that particles within\nthe till travel at a different speed from the bulge itself, and\nthe push moraine to advance as a form-conserving non-linear\nwave.\nCorrespondence to:\nG. J.-M. C. Leysinger Vieli\n(g.j.m.c.leysinger-vieli@durham.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nGlacier length changes have been recorded by measurements\nof the snout position and their mass-balance (Oerlemans,\n1989; Haeberli and Beniston, 1998; Oerlemans, 2001), by\ngeomorphological observations of the glacier forefield defor-\nmation, as well as by using traces in the landscape and histor-\nical glacier records to interpret the glacier fluctuations in the\npast (e.g., Drewry, 1986; Benn and Evans, 2010; Haeberli\nand Beniston, 1998; Oerlemans, 2001). Observed length\nchanges have been used to extract climate signals (e.g., Boul-\nton, 1986; Oerlemans, 2005; Beedle et al., 2009).\nGlacier flow can occur by several mechanisms: (1) ice de-\nformation; (2) deformation of the glacier bed; (3) sliding at\nthe ice-bed interface; or (4) a combination of these processes\n(e.g., Benn and Evans, 2010). A glacier advance by ice de-\nformation only, i.e. where the ice is frozen to the bed, leads to\nan advance by \u201coverriding\u201d, which means that the advancing\nglacier snout rolls its surface over the glacier forefield, poten-\ntially giving rise to inverse depth-age relationship within the\nice behind the glacier front. For an advance by (2) or (3) only,\nthe ice mass is moving as a block (\u201cplug-flow\u201d). A glacier\nadvance over a deformable till can lead to the formation of\n\u201cpush moraines\u201d, where the glacier appears to be bulldoz-\ning over and through the ice-marginal sediments (Boulton,\n1986; Van der Wateren, 1995; Benn and Evans, 2010; Ben-\nnett, 2001; Motyka and Echelmeyer, 2003).\nIn contrast to the large number of observational studies of\nthe advance of glaciers over a deforming substrate, there is\na conspicuous lack of numerical studies. Although a variety\nof numerical models have been used for calculating tempo-\nral changes in front position (e.g., Greuell, 1992; Schlosser,\n1997; Schmeits and Oerlemans, 1997; Wallinga and Van de\nWal, 1998; Oerlemans, 2001; Smedt and Pattyn, 2003), none\nof these models attempt to describe the details of ice flow, or\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n360 G. J.-M. C. Leysinger Vieli and G. H. Gudmundsson: Glacier advance over deforming till\nthe mechanical interactions between ice and till in the vicin-\nity of the glacier terminus. Here, assumptions commonly\nused in flow modelling of large ice masses, such as the shal-\nlow ice approximation (SIA) model (Hutter, 1983) do not\napply. Furthermore, we are not aware of any numerical work\nwhere the time-dependent deformation of both the ice and\nthe till is calculated in a fully coupled way using the full-set\nof the momentum equations.\nIn this paper we aim to answer the question of how the\nfront of a glacier residing on a layer of sediment advances\nand to investigate the details of the flow at an advancing\nglacier front, by using a two dimensional finite-element\nmodel designed for this purpose. This study extends and\ncomplements a previous study of ours (Leysinger Vieli and\nGudmundsson, 2004) focusing on the advance of a glacier\nover non-deforming substrate.\nOur modelling approach is generic in its nature and we do\nnot try to simulate the advance of any one particular glacier.\nRather, we are interested in the overall characteristics of the\nflow of ice and till, and the mechanical interaction between\nthe advancing glacier and the underlying till. Of special in-\nterest is the flow regime in the vicinity of the snout where\nthe assumptions of most previous models break down. We\naim at answering how till deformation is induced by the flow\nof a glacier, how the thickness distribution of till changes as\na glacier advances over it, and where till deforms primarily\nthrough shearing as opposed to horizontal compression. We\nstudy numerically the formation of push moraines and sug-\ngest that push moraines may be considered to be a type of\nform-conserving non-linear till waves.\n2 Modelling the advance of a glacier\nFor isotropic ice Glen\u2019s flow law is commonly used as a con-\nstitutive law (Glen, 1955). For subglacial till various dif-\nferent rheological models have been proposed (e.g., Fowler,\n2002; Clarke, 2005). The rheology of the till has been\nsuggested to behave like a linear or slightly non-linear vis-\ncous fluid (Alley et al., 1986, 1987; Boulton and Hind-\nmarsh, 1987; Alley, 1989; Alley et al., 1989; MacAyeal,\n1989, 1992), where the strain rates \u000f\u02d9 are related to the ef-\nfective stress \u03c4 through\n\u000f\u02d9\u221d \u03c4m, (1)\nwith a stress exponent m in the range of 1\u2264m\u22645 (e.g., Kamb,\n2001), such as m= 1.33 as fitted by Boulton and Hindmarsh\n(1987) for the till beneath Breidamerkurjo\u00a8kull or m= 3.04 as\noptimised by Gudmundsson (2007) for the subglacial till of\nRutford Ice Stream. It has also been pointed out that since\ntill is a granular medium its rheological behaviour should\nfall within the range commonly exhibited by such materi-\nals (Iverson et al., 1998; Tulaczyk et al., 2000a,b; Truffer\net al., 2000; Kamb, 2001; Kavanaugh and Clarke, 2006).\nTherefore, it should show Coulomb-plastic rheology (termed\n\u201ctreiboplastic\u201d by Kamb, 2001), with a yield stress which is\ncontrolled by intergranular friction and which depends only\nslightly, if at all, on the strain rate (Kamb, 1991; Iverson\net al., 1998).\nA perfectly plastic till rheology can be obtained by letting\nthe flow exponent m in Eq. (1) go to infinity. For stresses be-\nlow the yield stress (\u03c4o), deformation is negligible and for\nstresses exceeding the yield stress the deformation would\nbe infinitely large. As a result, the stress in the sediment\nnever exceeds the yield stress (Paterson; 1994; Van der Veen;\n1999). Kamb (2001) suggests that till rheology, as observed\nfor ice streams B, C and D (now Whillans, Kamb and Bind-\nschadler), is best described as \u201cimperfect treiboplastic\u201d, be-\ncause of an appreciable strain rate (\u000f\u02d9) dependence on the\nstress (\u03c3 ), which he expresses in a highly non-linear flow\nlaw with an exponent m\u2248 40\u00b1 20. Here we use the term\nnear perfect plastic to refer to such a highly non-linear rheol-\nogy.\nAs pointed out by Fowler (2002, 2003) a rigid\/perfectly\nplastic material can deform over long time-scales as if vis-\ncous. More recently the controversy is dealt with by investi-\ngating constitutive models of subglacial sediments which al-\nlow for different deformation under different conditions (e.g.,\nSane et al., 2008; Altuhafi et al., 2009). Here we consider\ncases corresponding to both non-linear viscous and near per-\nfect plastic rheology.\n2.1 Model description\nA time-dependent two-dimensional numerical plane-strain\nmodel is used to study the advance of a glacier over a layer\nof deforming till. The model treats the glacier and the un-\nderlying till as two independent slowly-deforming viscous\nbodies. The surface evolutions of both bodies are followed\nwith time and contacts between the bodies are automatically\ndetermined. In each time step, nodes that enter into or out of\ncontact are found and the boundary conditions are changed\naccordingly. Unstructured gridding and automated remesh-\ning are employed to limit element distortion. The full set\nof the equilibrium equations is solved, allowing for accurate\nestimates of stress and strain.\n2.1.1 Ice rheology\nGlen\u2019s flow law (Glen, 1955; Steineman, 1958)\n\u000f\u02d9ij =A\u03c4n\u22121\u03c3 (d)ij , (2)\nis used to describe the relationship between deviatoric\nstresses and strain rates in the ice as well as in the sediment\nlayer. Here \u000f\u02d9ij are the components of the strain rate tensor,\nand \u03c3 (d)ij are the components of the deviatoric stress tensor\n\u03c3\n(d)\nij = \u03c3ij \u2212\n1\n3\n\u03b4ij\u03c3kk, (3)\nThe Cryosphere, 4, 359\u2013372, 2010 www.the-cryosphere.net\/4\/359\/2010\/\nG.

The effective stress \u03c4 is defined by\n\u03c4 2 = 1\n2\n\u03c3\n(d)\nij \u03c3\n(d)\nij . (4)\nThe rate factor A and the stress exponent n are material pa-\nrameters. For the ice body the flow law exponent is chosen as\nn= 3. Values for other parameters are given below. All pa-\nrameters are made non-dimensional by the use of appropriate\nscalings (see Sect. 2.1.4 and Appendix A).\n2.1.2 Till rheology\nThe till is treated in a formally similar manner as the ice, that\nis as an incompressible non-linear viscous medium (Glen\u2019s\nflow law, Eq. 2). The rate factor and the stress exponent of\nthe till are denoted by A\u2032 and m, respectively. The till density\nwas set to \u03c1s = 2200 kg m\u22123.\nIt is one of the interesting facts of glaciological research\nthat despite decades of work on this subject no general con-\nsensus has emerged on the most appropriate numerical values\nfor the modelling parameter m. Values for m ranging from\n1 to infinity are commonly used (e.g., Iverson et al., 1998;\nKamb, 2001; Clarke, 2005). Here we bracket the range of\npossible rheologies by using a wide range of values for the\nrate factor (A\u2032) and the stress exponent (m).\nThe till rheology is determined by a number of factors and\nprocesses that do not concern us here. We do not consider\nin detail how the particular numerical values of the rheologi-\ncal parameters of the till are related to grain size, pore water\npressure, etc. which is an important question in itself but en-\ntirely unrelated to our modelling work.\n2.1.3 Model geometry and mass balance distribution\nThe general model geometry is depicted schematically in\nFig. 1. The glacier is everywhere in contact with a de-\nformable till layer. The till layer extends sufficiently far to\nthe front of the initial glacier geometry to ensure that while\nadvancing the glacier remains in contact with the till. Ini-\ntially, the thickness of the till is uniform and set to about\n1\/20th of the maximum ice thickness. Where the ice is in\ncontact with the till no differential motion between ice and\ntill is allowed. No mass is added to, or extracted from, the\nsediments in the course of the calculations. In all our experi-\nments the geometry of the base of the till layer is kept fixed,\nwith a steep upper part (45\u25e6) and a lower part sloping at 5\u25e6\nas shown in Fig. 1. Our choice for the initial geometry and\nthe slope of the base of the till layer does not affect our final\nconclusions.\nWe chose a height-dependent mass balance function such\nas\nb\u02d9(z)=\n{\naacc(zs\u2212ELA) when zs >ELA\n0 when zs \u2264ELA , (5)\nFig. 1. Schematic view of the glacier considered in the two-layer model. The ice body (white) resides\non a sediment layer (grey) which extends into the glacier forefield. The inclination of the upper part is\n45\u25e6 and of 5\u25e6 for the lower part.\nfigure\n27\nFig. 1. Schematic view of the glacier considered in the two-layer\nmodel. The ice body (white) resides on a sediment layer (grey)\nwhich extends into the glacier forefield. The inclination of the upper\npart is 45\u25e6 and of 5\u25e6 for the lower part.\nwhere ELA is the equilibrium line altitude, located at a height\nof 0.5 dimensionless units (defined below) and zs is the\nsurface height of the glacier. Above the ELA a positive\nmass balance gradient aacc of 0.0117 (non-dimensional units)\nis used. Note that this mass-balance distribution includes\naltitude-mass balance feedback in the accumulation area\nonly. The use of this particular form of the surface mass-\nbalance distribution is motivated by the requirement that the\noverall mass balance must remain positive in order to en-\nsure continued advance. Setting the mass-balance to zero for\nzs\u2264ELA simplifies our analysis of the movements of mate-\nrial particles in the vicinity of the snout. Due to this chosen\nmass-balance distribution no equilibrium is reached and the\nglacier is in a perpetual state of advance.\nAn initial glacier geometry was generated for a hard bed\nby running a SIA model. Once the glacier had advanced to\na total length of three times the size of the accumulation area,\nwe switched from using the SIA model and did the rest of the\nrun using the full-system model. Our conclusions are not af-\nfected by the details of the starting geometry, as the geometry\nobtained from the SIA model is, except for the frontal region,\nsimilar to the one calculated for the FS model (see Leysinger\nVieli and Gudmundsson, 2004) and the differences at the\nfront are quickly adjusted by the different flowfield obtained\nby the FS model (see e.g. adjustment for the initial surface\nmarked with \u201cb\u201d in Fig. 2a). The use of SIA in the initial\nmodelling stage is based on practical considerations and a de-\nsire to limit computational times involved.\n2.1.4 Normalisation\nWe introduce non-dimensional variables for the space coor-\ndinates {X,Z}, the components of the velocity vector {U,W },\nthe time {T } and the effective stress {Teff} defined as {x\/[h],\nz\/[h], u\/[us], w\/[us], t\/([h]\/[us]), \u03c4\/[\u03c4d]}, where [h] is\na typical mean thickness of a glacier, [us] a typical mean\nhorizontal surface velocity and [\u03c4d] = \u03c1g[h]sin(\u03b1s) the driv-\ning stress assuming the same surface slope \u03b1s = 5\u25e6 as the\nwww.the-cryosphere.net\/4\/359\/2010\/ The Cryosphere, 4, 359\u2013372, 2010\n362 G.

As we are scaling with the extended in-\nclined ice slab (see Appendix A) [h] corresponds to the thick-\nness of the ice slab and [us] to the analytical solution for the\nsurface velocity (Eq. A1). The non-dimensional ice thick-\nness H and mean ice thickness [H ] are defined as ho\/[h]\nand [ho]\/[h], respectively, where ho is the local and [ho] the\nmean ice thickness of the observed or modelled glacier.\n2.1.5 Numerical solution technique\nThe model calculations were performed with the commercial\nfinite-element (FE) program MARC (2000) tailored for use\nin glaciology by Gudmundsson (1999). The code solves the\nfull set of momentum equations and has been used exten-\nsively for flow modelling of alpine and grounded tidewater\nglaciers (Gudmundsson, 1999; Vieli et al., 2001; Leysinger\nVieli and Gudmundsson, 2004). We refer to this model\nas the full system model (FS). The transient evolution of\nthe surface and the ice-sediment interface is followed using\na mixed Lagrange-Euler approach. As the surface evolves,\nautomated remeshing is used when needed to limit mesh dis-\ntortion (Leysinger and Gudmundsson, 2000; Leysinger Vieli,\n2003). The remeshing strategy (Leysinger Vieli, 2003) uses\na cubic spline interpolation to reposition nodal points along\nall singular surfaces. It has been verified that the remeshing\nalgorithm preserves the total volume accurately and that the\nmodel results are not affected by smaller time steps or more\nrefined mesh. The FE code has been verified by compar-\ning its numerical results with transient analytical solutions\n(Gudmundsson, 1997; Adalgeirsdo\u00b4ttir et al., 2000; Raymond\net al., 2003; Gudmundsson, 2007) and by comparing the\ntime-dependent response for a linear flow law (Newtonian\nflow) with the analytical solution (ISMIP-HOM Benchmark\nexperiment F, Pattyn et al., 2008).\n2.1.6 Model parameters\nWe consider two end-member cases of different modes of\nadvance where (a) the till is much stiffer than the ice and all\nthe deformation takes place in the ice, and (b) the opposite\nsituation where ice is much stiffer than the till and all de-\nformation takes place within the till layer. These different\nlimiting cases of modes of advance can be generated in our\nnumerical model simply by varying the contrast in effective\nviscosity between ice and till.\nAfter normalisation, the results of the numerical runs de-\npend only on the ratio of the rheological parameters. We\nkeep the rate factor A and the stress exponent n fixed and\nvary the corresponding rheological parameters A\u2032 and m of\nthe till. The non-dimensional rate factor for the ice is A= 2\n(Eq. A4), this follows directly from the scalings used, when\nwe set n= 3. For a soft, highly deforming sediment the ratio\nbetween the rate factor A in the ice and A\u2032 in the sediment is\nsmall (\u001c1) and for a highly rigid sediment this ratio is large\n(\u001d1).

The value m= 40 is used to simulate a nearly perfect\nplastic rheology as suggested by Kamb (2001).\nTo be able to get similar effective viscosities (\u03b7 =\n1\/2A\u2032\u03c4m\u22121) in the sediment at given stresses with different\nm we define B for the till as\nB =A\u2032\u22121\/m.

For such a high stress exponent the till will only\ndeform significantly in regions where the effective stress \u03c4 is\napproaching B. The values used in the model experiments\nare shown in Table 1.\n3 Results\nAs already mentioned, the model is formulated in dimen-\nsionless variables and therefore the results shown are all\ndimensionless. One can easily go from non-dimensional\nvariables to dimensional ones. Our non-dimensional ver-\ntical space coordinate Z extends from 0 to 1, as the ex-\ntent of the grid in z has been chosen to be the same as the\nthickness [h] of the infinitely extended inclined ice slab (see\nAppendix A). For example, choosing a rate factor of A=\n2.06\u00d710\u221215 s\u22121 (kPa)\u22123 for temperate ice (Hubbard et al.,\n1998; Gudmundsson, 1999; Albrecht et al., 2000), a mean\nthickness [h] = 1000 m for the ice slab and a slope of \u03b1 =\n5\u25e6 results in a mean horizontal surface velocity of [us] =\n2A\/(n + 1)(\u03c1gsin(\u03b1))n[h]n+1 = 1.5665\u00d7104 m a\u22121. For\nthis example one non-dimensionless unit in length, veloc-\nity and in time, corresponds to 1000 m, 1.5665\u00d7104 m a\u22121\nand 0.0638 years, respectively. Note that since our non-\ndimensional vertical space coordinate Z extends from 0 to\n1, the mean dimensionless thickness of the modelled glacier\n[H ] is approximately 0.2Z (e.g. see Figs. 3, 10, 13 and 14),\nwhich corresponds to a mean glacier thickness [ho] = 200 m\nfor our example.\n3.1 Experiment A: relatively stiff and moderately\nnon-linear till\nWe start our discussion of the numerical results by consid-\nering a case where the till is relatively stiff in comparison to\nthe ice. We use B = 8, which is a high value as compared to\nthe mean effective basal stress of unity, and m= 3. This ex-\nperiment illustrates how glaciers advance over stiff till, and\nserves as a reference case for the set of experiments described\nlater where the advance gives rise to significant till deforma-\ntion.\nThe front advance is shown in Fig. 2a as a series of snap-\nshots depicting the longitudinal surface profiles at different\ntimes. The surface of the till is also plotted in Fig. 2a for the\nsame times, but, as expected, no change in till thickness is\nvisible due to its relative stiffness in this experiment.\nThe surface profile at t = 0, marked with \u201cb\u201d, in Fig. 2a\ncorresponds to the last profile obtained with the SIA model,\nand the starting profile of the full-system (FS) model. As\nFig. 2a shows, the surface profile of the SIA model is\nmarkedly different from the one obtained with the FS model.\nThe SIA model calculates velocity from local slope and\nthickness, and predicts infinitely large velocities for verti-\ncal slopes.

Figure 2a shows how the surface slope initially\nincreases, finally resulting in an overhanging snout.\nFigure 2b\u2013d show how various material particles (dots in\nthe figures) within the ice move as the front advances under\nno-melt conditions. In Fig. 2b positions of selected material\nparticles at the surface, at the base, and within the glacier are\nshown at different points in time. Due to the relative stiffness\nof the till, all material particles at the ice-sediment interface\nstay fixed at their respective locations, and the ice-sediment\ninterface remains parallel to the bed (see Fig. 2b\u2013d). Material\nparticles within the ice, however, gradually move down-slope\neventually passing the position of the initial glacier front.\nAs the front advances, and owing to our assumption of no-\nmelt, ice particles that previously were located at the glacier\nsurface come in contact with the till surface. This leads to\noverfolding within the ice of the glacier front near the ice-\nsediment interface, and forms a new basal layer of ice giving\nrise to depth-age inversion.\nFigure 3 shows vertical profiles of the non-dimensional\nhorizontal velocity U and effective stress Teff at three differ-\nent positions along the glacier for the overriding case. At\neach location the effective stress generally increases with\ndepth. Note that at the snout the effective stress reaches its\nmaximum value at the interface between the ice and the till,\nand not at the base of the till as is the case further upstream.\nwww.the-cryosphere.net\/4\/359\/2010\/ The Cryosphere, 4, 359\u2013372, 2010\n364 G.

In this experiment the\nglacier advances primarily through deformation of the un-\nderlying sediment and without any significant deformation\nof the ice.\nIn Fig. 4a, glacier and sediment surface profiles are shown\nat different times. Clearly visible is the formation of a sedi-\nment bulge in front of the glacier. The amplitude of the bulge\nas a function of distance is shown in Fig. 4b. The geometry\nand the positions of a number of material points within the\nice and at the till interface are shown in Fig. 4c\u2013e and the cor-\nresponding profiles in Fig. 4a are labelled c, d, and e. Further\ndetails of the sediment deformation are given in Figs. 5 and\n6.\nOne of the most interesting results of the experiment is the\nformation of the sediment bulge in front of the glacier snout.\nAfter an initial period of rapid growth the amplitude of the\nbulge approaches a steady state value (see Fig. 4a). Fol-\nlowing the movement of material points within the till (see\nFigs. 5 and 6) reveals that till particles within the bulge travel\nat a different speed to that of the bulge itself. Thus, the bulge\nis an example of a propagating till wave. Till particles get in-\ncorporated into the till wave for a limited period of time, and\nare then left behind as the wave travels further. The distribu-\ntion of horizontal and vertical velocity, and of the effective\nstress is shown in Fig. 7a, b, and c, respectively. This figure\ncan b compared directly to Fig. 8a, b, and c depicting results\nfrom Experiment A. Because of the relative stiffness of the\nice, the velocity field of the glacier is close to being constant\neverywhere, and almost the entire forward motion is due to\ntill deformation (Fig. 7a). The vertical velocity distribution\nwithin the till bulge (Fig. 7b) shows how the part of the bulge\nin contact with e ice s being pressed downward, resulting\nin negative vertical velocities, while the down-glacier side of\nthe bulge moves upwards.\nFigs. 7c and 8c show the distribution of the effective stress\nfor Experiments B and A, respectively.

The continuity of\nthe stress field seen in Figs. 7c and 8c is a demonstration of\nthe accuracy of the numerical solution.\nThe velocity distribution within the sediment bulge is\nshown in detail with velocity vectors in Fig. 9. As the figure\nshows, the ice in the frontal area presses the till downwards\nand forwards at the same time. Note that the ice velocity\nis larger than that of any of the material particles in the till\nbulge. With time the glacier therefore overrides the till parti-\ncles previously within the bulge, while at the same time, due\nto the upward motion in the frontal region, new till particles\nare incorporated into the bulge.\nFrom the ratio of basal to surface velocity in Fig. 10b we\nsee that at the glacier front the flow is dominated by sediment\ndeformation (Ub\/Us\u22481), and that the contribution of the ice\nto the total deformation increases in the upstream direction.\nThe increase in till deformation towards the glacier front is\nalso seen in the vertical profiles of the horizontal velocity\nin Fig. 10c\u2013e and in Table 2. The observed distribution of\nthe effective stress in the three vertical profiles is similar to\nthe one obtained for Experiment A with the exception of the\nfrontal profile, where the highest shear stress is found at the\nsediment base (Fig. 10e) and not at the ice-sediment inter-\nface.\n3.3 Experiment C: moderately stiff and moderately\nnon-linear till\nWe set B = 2\u22121\/3\u22480.79, giving an equal rate factor within\nthe ice and the till. The advance now follows through a mix-\nture of both ice and till deformation (see Figs. 11a\u2013e and 12).\nIn this experiment, flow features that were only seen either in\nExperiment A or B act in combination. As the ice advances\nover the till, material particles previously at the surface come\nin contact with the till and form a new basal ice layer. At\nthe same time the till deforms giving rise to a propagating till\nwave similar to that seen in Experiment B (Fig. 11a\u2013e).\nDetailed view of the till deformation is given Fig. 12. The\nadvance of the glacier causes shearing within the till, com-\nbined with a horizontal compression in the snout region. As\nin Experiment B a sediment bulge is formed, but due to the\nlarger stiffness of the till the bulge is about 8 times smaller.\nThe ratio of basal to surface velocity as a function of dis-\ntance is shown in Fig. 13b. The ratio increases sharply to-\nwards the snout implying that measurements of till defor-\nmation and surface velocity in that area are not reliable es-\ntimates of the glacier wide contribution of basal motion to\nthe forward motion of a glacier. The effective stress distri-\nbution shown in Fig. 13c\u2013e also reveals that the magnitude\nand distribution of stresses within the till in the terminus area\n(Fig. 13e) differ strongly from those found further up-glacier.\nIn the terminus area, the stresses in the till decrease with\ndepth rather than increasing as is the case elsewhere.\nwww.the-cryosphere.net\/4\/359\/2010\/ The Cryosphere, 4, 359\u2013372, 2010\n366 G.

Here\nwe repeat those experiments for a near perfect plastic till\nrheology by choosing a flow law exponent m= 40 (Kamb,\n2001).

Where \u03c4>B the till deforms readily, but\nhardly at all where \u03c4<B. We found in all our experiments\nthat the highest effective stresses in the till were reached in\nthe terminus area.

This agrees favourably with\nKuriger et al.\u2019s (2006) finding that decreased effective fric-\ntional resistance of the sediment is the key parameter affect-\ning rates of internal sediment deformation.\nwww.the-cryosphere.net\/4\/359\/2010\/ The Cryosphere, 4, 359\u2013372, 2010\n368 G.

To our knowledge the model pre-\nsented here is, however, the first numerical model of glacier\nadvance over till that produces a feature closely resembling\npush moraines as they are observed.\nThe process of advance producing a push moraine is often\nobserved to be a seasonal process with advance in late win-\nter while the till is frozen and squeezing out of water-soaked\ntill from beneath the glacier during the early summer melt\nperiod (e.g., Price, 1970; Boulton, 1986; Evans and Hiem-\n      \n0.350\n0.355\n0.360\n0.365\nH\nei\ngh\nt Z\na\n      \n0.350\n0.355\n0.360\n0.365\nH\nei\ngh\nt Z\nb\n1.86 1.88 1.90 1.92 1.94 1.96\nDistance X\n0.350\n0.355\n0.360\n0.365\nH\nei\ngh\nt Z\nc\nFig. 12.

The snapshots were taken at dimensionless\ntimes T equal to 0 (a), 8 (b) and 14 (c). Three vertical straight lines\nin (a) are followed throughout (b\u2013c).\nstra, 2005). By varying the hardness of the sediment sea-\nsonally our odel should be able to reproduce such seasonal\npush\/squeeze moraines. Truffer et al. (2009) inferred from\nfield measurements and numerical modelling that the mode\nof glacier advance changes on seasonal timescales on Taku\nGlacier, Alaska, from internal deformation (winter) to plug-\nflow (summer), depending only on small changes in the basal\nboundary condition.\nThe numerical modelling experiments show how a glacier\nadvancing over a soft till causes shearing within the till that,\ndepending on the value of the stress exponent m, gives rise to\nspatially highly variable rates of basal motion (see Figs. 13b\nand 14b). In all our modelling experiments, the highest ratio\nof basal motion to surface velocity was found in the terminus\narea. Measurements of basal motion in that area are there-\nfore potentially not representative of a glacier as a whole.\nAn example for such a measurement site is the tunnel sys-\ntem dug in the ice about 1 to 2 m above the glacier sole\nand approximately 24 to 44 m behind the terminus of Brei-\ndamerkurjo\u00a8kull, Iceland, described by Boulton (1979). By\nassuming no slip at the glacier sole, the displacement due\nto sediment deformation at this site was between 95% and\n80% of the forward movement of the glacier (Boulton and\nHindmarsh, 1987). If we assume an average thickness of\n400 m for Breidamerkurjo\u00a8kull (Bjo\u00a8rnsson et al., 2001; using\nslope as in our model), then the position behind the terminus\nis about 1\/16 to 1\/9 of the typical mean ice thickness [ho]\nThe Cryosphere, 4, 359\u2013372, 2010 www.the-cryosphere.net\/4\/359\/2010\/\nG.

Their measured sediment displace-\nment, especially at the higher end, is in the same range as\nobtained in this study for the plug-flow case (Experiment B).\nMechanical interaction between ice and till alone is suf-\nficient to give rise to till thickening with time in the termi-\nnus area. The thickening is caused by combined action of\nshearing through the till column and horizontal compression\ntowards the terminus. No other potential modes of sediment\ntransport, i.e. suspended sediment transport or entrainment of\nsediment into the ice, were described in the model. Includ-\ning erosion and\/or hydraulic transport would modify long-\nterm evolution of the sediment thickness (e.g., Motyka et al.,\n2006). Similarly, the moraine structure in front of the ter-\nminus would be modified by pro-glacial fluvial and eolian\nprocesses.\nIf sufficiently soft, the till is extruded from underneath the\nglacier towards the terminus. This happens through direct\nvertical mechanical action of the ice on the underlying sed-\niments. Such moraine forming by extrusion flow has been\nobserved in nature and discussed in the literature (e.g., Price,\n1970; Sharp, 1984; Evans and Hiemstra, 2005).

What has\nbeen touched on by Van der Wateren (1995) but possibly not\nbeen fully realised since, and is also suggested by our mod-\nelling, is the possibility that the push moraines are a form of\nnon-linear shape-conserving waves where horizontal move-\nment of individual till particles is insignificant in compari-\nson to the total distance travelled by the moraine. We also\nemphasise that the formation of the push moraine does not\nrequire the terminus to be in a steady state for any signifi-\ncant period of time. In fact in our modelling approach the\nterminus is never in steady state but advances continuously.\nWhere the till is too stiff to be significantly deformed, the\nglacier advances through \u201coverriding\u201d or \u201cmixed-flow\u201d. In\nnature examples of this type of advance can be found in ad-\nvancing glaciers in sub-\/polar regions where melting is negli-\ngible (e.g. Glaciers on Axel Heiberg Island, Canadian Arctic\nArchipelago and in the Dry Valleys, Antarctica). A possi-\nble example of a glacier advance by overriding or by mixed-\nflow is Crusoe Glacier from Axel Heiberg Island where the\nfolding structure revealed in a photo taken of the west front\nby Alean (2008) could be interpreted as the inverse layering\nobtained from overfolding within the glacier front.

Glacier advance calculated with a altitude-dependent mass\nbalance distribution over the whole glacier as used in Leysinger\nVieli and Gudmundsson (2004) and shown using the same scale as\nin Fig. 2a.\nexample of advance by overriding are active rock glaciers,\nwhich have insignificant mass loss through surface ablation.\nOn the other hand, for glaciers with surface melting in alpine\nenvironments a realistic shape of an advancing glacier front\nwould be less steep. Previous model calculations for the evo-\nlution of advancing glaciers residing on a bedrock with a re-\nalistic mass balance distribution, done by Leysinger Vieli\nand Gudmundsson (2004), indeed show that the front ge-\nometry is less curved than the one with zero mass balance\n(Fig. 15). Although incomplete, one would still expect to\nfind the overfolded ice layers within the glacier front for\nthe overriding and the mixed-flow case, as widely seen in\nterminal ice cliffs (e.g. Hook and Hudleston, 1978; Benn\nand Evans, 2010). Due to ablation, the surface layers are\ncontinously truncated, and therefore the completeness of the\nfolding structure depends very much on the prevailing melt\nand\/or dry calving rate.\nRaising the flow exponent m from 3 to 40 changes the\nvertical distribution of the horizontal velocities within the\nsediment. For this near perfect plastic rheology the veloc-\nity increase is largest close to the base of the sediment layer\n(Fig. 14d), whereas for m= 3 the increase is approximately\nlinear over depth. The main effect of increasing the value of\nthe stress factor, however, is to increase the relative contrast\nin the contribution of basal motion to the overall forward mo-\ntion between different areas. The result is a more pronounced\nspatial variation in distribution of basal velocities.\n6 Conclusions\nBy modelling numerically the advance of a glacier over a de-\nforming sediment layer as a contact problem involving two\nviscous bodies, we have shown how push moraines can be\nformed. During glacier advance, till particles enter and then\nsubsequently leave the push moraine. After an initial phase\nthe size and the shape of the push moraine does not change\nwith time. The formation of the push moraine is a \u201crobust\u201d\nmodelling result in the sense that its genesis does not depend\non a fortuitous choice of parameters but occurs in the model\nfor a wide range of parameter values.\nAlthough we only modelled a glacier in its advancing\nstage, the formation of the moraine and analysis of the tra-\njectories of the till particles suggest that such a push moraine\nwould also form during a stationary stage or even during a re-\ntreat phase.\nDespite the model parameters describing the till rheology\n(m and B), as well as the initial till thickness distribution,\nto be spatially uniform, resulting distribution of basal mo-\ntion is highly non-uniform. Highest rates of basal motion,\nas compared to surface velocity, are found in the vicinity of\nthe terminus area. Rates of basal motion measured close to\na glacier terminus are not reliable estimates of basal motion\na few ice thicknesses further up-glacier.\nAppendix A\nScaling of the flow law\nA For an infinitely extended inclined ice slab with the thick-\nness [h] and the slope \u03b1 the analytical solution for the surface\nvelocity, due to internal deformation, is given by\n[ud] = 2A\nn+1 [\u03c4 ]\nn[h], (A1)\nwhere the basal shear stress if given by \u03c4 = \u03c1g[h]sin(\u03b1).\nTo get dimensionless variables we scale dimensional quan-\ntities with corresponding quantities for the infinite extended\ninclined slab, that is: lengths with the thickness [h], velocities\nwith the deformation velocity [ud] (Eq. A1), stresses with the\nbasal shear stress [\u03c4 ] and strain rates with [ud]\/[h]. Glen\u2019s\nflow law (Eq. 2) is now written as\n\u000f\u02d9ij\n[h]\n[ud] = A\u03c4\nn\u22121\u03c3 (d)ij\n[h]\n[ud]\n= \u03c4\nn\u22121\u03c3 (d)ij\n2\nn+1 [\u03c4 ]n\n. (A2)\nThe term on the left hand side of Eq. (A2) is the non-\ndimensional strain tensor E\u02d9ij . The non-dimensional stress\ntensor and effective stress are given by 6(d)ij = \u03c3 (d)ij \/[\u03c4 ] and\nTeff = \u03c4\/[\u03c4 ], respectively. Equation (A2) can be rewritten as\nE\u02d9ij = n+12 T\nn\u22121\neff 6\n(d)\nij , (A3)\nwhich is the non-dimensional formulation of Glen\u2019s flow law\n(Eq. 2).
