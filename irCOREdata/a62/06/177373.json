MSCs are\nattractive candidates for biological cell-based tissue repair approaches because of their extensive proliferative\nability in culture while retaining their mesenchymal multilineage differentiation potential. In addition to its\nundoubted scientific interest, the prospect of monitoring and controlling MSC differentiation is a crucial regu-\nlatory and clinical requirement. Hence, the molecular regulation of MSC differentiation has been extensively\nstudied. Most of the studies are in vitro, because the identity of MSCs in their tissues of origin in vivo remains\nundefined. This review addresses the current knowledge of the molecular basis of differentiation of cultured\nMSCs, with a particular focus on chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. Building on the information coming from\ndevelopmental biology studies of embryonic skeletogenesis, several signaling pathways and transcription fac-\ntors have been investigated and shown to play critical roles in MSC differentiation. In particular, the Wnt and\ntransforming growth factor-b\/bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathways are well known to modulate in\nMSCs the molecular differentiation into cartilage and bone. Relevant to the emerging concept of stem cell niches\nis the demonstration that physical factors can also participate in the regulation of MSC differentiation.\nKnowledge of the regulation of MSC differentiation will be critical in the design of three-dimensional culture\nsystems and bioreactors for automated bioprocessing through mathematical models applied to systems biology\nand network science.\nMesenchymal Stem Cells: A Brief Overview\nMesenchymal stromal\/stem cells (MSCs), a subset of\nstromal cells present at low frequency in most adult con-\nnective tissues, have been extensively studied for their mul-\ntiple differentiation capabilities. Friedenstein and colleagues\n(1970) demonstrated that the bone marrow contains a rare\npopulation of plastic-adherent cells (approximately 1 in\n10,000 nucleated cells) that were able to form single-cell-\nderived colonies. The adherent cell clones expanded into\nround-shaped colonies composed of fibroblastoid cells, thus\nleading to the term colony-forming unit\u2014fibroblasts (CFU-f);\nafter proliferation some of the colonies could differentiate\ninto aggregates resembling small areas of bone or cartilage\n(Friedenstein et al., 1970, 1976). These initial observations\nwere then extended by the study of CFU-f proliferative\nabilities and phenotypic characteristics (Castro-Malaspina\net al., 1980; Prockop, 1997; Caplan and Bruder, 2001). These\ncells were eventually defined as multipotent and able to\ndifferentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and\neven myoblasts.\nMSC Differentiation: The Caveat of In Vitro Studies\nMSCs have been studied in several species, especially\nhumans (Castro-Malaspina et al., 1980; Haynesworth et al.,\n1992; Bruno et al., 2009; Yoo et al., 2009) and mice (Gindraux\net al., 2007; Sung et al., 2008). MSCs are classically derived\nfrom bone marrow (Pittenger et al., 1999), but they have been\nisolated as well from most connective tissues (da Silva\nMeirelles et al., 2006), including, to mention a few, adipose\ntissue (Zuk et al., 2002), periosteum (Nakahara et al., 1991; De\nBari et al., 2001a, 2006), and synovial membrane (De Bari\net al., 2001b, 2003). From the accumulating studies in the\nliterature, it is now apparent that MSCs, whichever their\ntissue source, have ability to respond to a variety of physi-\nological or pathogenic stimuli, producing responses that in\neach specific context require thorough investigation in order\nto assess their biological significance and exploit any\npotential clinical impact.\nThe differentiation of MSCs has been extensively studied,\nusing mainly well-established in vitro assays with culture-\nexpanded MSCs. Findings, therefore, have the caveat that\nRegenerative Medicine Unit, Bone and Musculoskeletal Research Programme, Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen,\nAberdeen AB25 2ZD, United Kingdom.\nHUMAN GENE THERAPY 21:1\u201313 (October 2010)\n\u00aa Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.\nDOI: 10.1089\/hum.2010.173\n1\nthey may not always be reliable and fully reproducible be-\ncause of the vast heterogeneity of in vitro culture conditions\nand MSC types. Indeed, MSCs are known to undergo phe-\nnotypic rearrangements during ex vivo manipulations, losing\nexpression of some markers while acquiring new ones ( Jones\net al., 2002). In addition, the possibility exists that the MSC\nphenotype and abilities vary between in vivo and in vitro\nsettings because of the removal from their natural environ-\nment and the use of chemical and physical growth conditions\nthat might alter their characteristics. The in vitro-obtained\ndata are overly dependent on culture conditions for deriva-\ntion and expansion of MSC populations and, therefore, are\nunlikely to be extrapolated to the native cells. Data may also\nnot be entirely valid across species and intraspecies. As an\nexample, murine MSCs differ not only from the human\nMSCs, but also between strains in marker expression and\nbehavior in culture (Peister et al., 2004; Sung et al., 2008;\nFiorina et al., 2009). Furthermore, data showed that MSCs\nfrom different tissues present phenotypic heterogeneity and\ndifferent growth abilities (Baksh et al., 2007; Rebelatto et al.,\n2008), reflecting a tissue specificity that could be correlated to\nmarked biological and functional differences (De Bari et al.,\n2008). Such heterogeneity could also underpin the regulation\nof MSCs and their responses to external stimuli, and it could\nbe a main source of variation in the biological properties of\nMSCs. To complicate things further, studies on MSCs have\nnot always been performed with primary cells but with cell\nlines such as C3H10T1\/2 (Shea et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2010).\nThis makes the reported findings not directly extrapolatable\nto primary human MSCs and of complex interpretation\nwithin the full biological picture.\nDespite biological differences, MSCs from multiple tissue\nsources share common features such as the potential to dif-\nferentiate into mesenchymal lineages and the expression of\ncommon surface markers (Baksh et al., 2007), although even\nwithin each tissue source, single-cell-derived clonal MSC\npopulations are highly heterogeneous in their proliferative\nand differentiation potentials (Phinney and Prockop, 2007;\nDe Bari et al., 2008).\nDifferentiation Potency of Culture-Expanded MSCs\nOne of the criteria to define MSCs is their ability to dif-\nferentiate into the osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic\nlineages (Dominici et al., 2006). Classically, osteogenic dif-\nferentiation of human MSCs ( Jaiswal et al., 1997; Pittenger\net al., 1999) requires incubation in fetal bovine serum (FBS)-\ncontaining medium supplemented with ascorbic acid,\nb-glycerophosphate, and dexamethasone, resulting in an in-\ncrease in alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposi-\ntion. The chondrogenic differentiation is performed with a\nhigh cell-density pellet or micromass culture treated with\ntransforming growth factor (TGF)-b in serum-free medium;\nthis results in production of cartilage-specific, highly sulfated\nproteoglycans and type II collagen. For adipogenic differ-\nentiation, MSCs are treated with dexamethasone, insulin,\nisobutyl methyl xanthine, and indomethacin (added to me-\ndium containing FBS), and the differentiation is revealed by\nthe detection of lipid vacuoles with oil red O staining. At the\nclonal level, however, not all clonal populations are able to\ndifferentiate into all three lineages, as some MSC clones may\nlack differentiation into at least one lineage (Pittenger et al.,\n1999). Subsequent studies indicated the possible existence of\na hierarchical model of differentiation, with human bone\nmarrow clonal MSC populations readily differentiating into\nthe three lineages but undergoing a sequential loss of lineage\npotential with the osteogenic precursors as residual cells\n(Muraglia et al., 2000).\nIncreasing evidence, indeed, indicates that MSC popula-\ntions are heterogeneous with coexisting subsets having\nvarying potency; this applies to bone marrow MSCs as well\nas to MSCs from other tissues. As an example, we reported\nthat human synovium-derived clonal MSCs were all capable\nof osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation although\nwith varying potency, but only 30% of the clonal populations\ntested were able to differentiate into adipocytes (Karystinou\net al., 2009).\nUnder appropriate conditions, MSCs can also differentiate\ninto other mesenchymal lineages such as skeletal myocytes\nand tenocytes (Wakitani et al., 1995; De Bari et al., 2003;\nHoffmann et al., 2006). MSCs have also been reported to\ndifferentiate into nonmesenchymal lineages such as neurons\n(Black and Woodbury, 2001). The clinical relevance of the\npresumptive nonmesenchymal potency of MSCs is, however,\nquestioned because, for example, MSC-derived neuron-like\ncells were unable to generate action potentials and, therefore,\nto function as neurons (Hofstetter et al., 2002).\nMSC-derived cartilage and bone\nThe \u2018\u2018natural\u2019\u2019 mesenchymal propensity of MSCs has\nprompted researchers to devote attention to the chondro-\ngenic and osteogenic abilities of MSCs with the clinical\nprospects of developing MSC-based biological approaches to\nthe repair of articular cartilage and bone. The osteogenic\npotential of culture-expanded MSCs (Friedenstein et al., 1976;\nAshton et al., 1985) has been studied extensively in vitro and\nin vivo. The first in vivo experiments with MSCs were per-\nformed with diffusion chambers loaded with culture-\nexpanded cells (Ashton et al., 1980). Later, the adoption of\nbioscaffolds such as hydroxyapatite (HA) implanted in im-\nmunocompromised mice proved useful in studying MSC\nosteogenic differentiation in vivo (Ohgushi and Okumura,\n1990). It was possible to obtain donor MSC-derived bone by\nsubcutaneous implantation of HA scaffolds seeded with\nhuman MSCs (Muraglia et al., 1998; Bluteau et al., 2008; De\nBari and Dell\u2019Accio, 2008; De Bari et al., 2008; Dell\u2019Accio et al.,\n2008). Using HA-based bioscaffolds, it then became possible\nto repair segmental bone defects in vivo by using autologous\nMSCs, under loaded conditions, both in large animals (Kon\net al., 2000) as well as in humans in proof-of-concept studies\n(Quarto et al., 2001).\nThe use of MSCs in clinical practice remains challenging\nfor issues such as the plethora of tissue sources and culture\nconditions, with resulting biological variability. For instance,\nhuman periosteum contains cells that after enzymatic release\nand culture expansion display the MSC phenotype and\ncapacity at the single-cell level to differentiate into multi-\nple skeletal lineages including bone (De Bari et al., 2006).\nNotably, in a proof-of-concept study we quantified the bone-\nforming potency of matched human MSCs from synovium\nand periosteum and analyzed the sources of variability in\nosteogenic outcome. We identified the tissue of origin of\nMSCs as the main source of variability, because MSCs from\n2 AUGELLO AND DE BARI\nperiosteum had significantly greater osteogenic potency than\nMSCs from synovium. A second source of variability was\nrelated to the individual donor, within each tissue. We\nmeasured the basal expression levels of osteoblast-lineage\ngenes in clonal MSCs before osteogenic treatment, identified\nbiomarkers that correlated with osteogenic outcome, and\ndeveloped a mathematical model that predicts bone-forming\npotency of clonal MSC preparations, independent of donor\nand tissue source (De Bari et al., 2008). The development of\na biomarker-based model that predicts the bone-forming\npotency of human MSC preparations is of considerable\nclinical relevance. A similar approach is likely to increase the\nconsistency of therapies that employ MSCs for bone repair. It\nmay also facilitate the selection of individuals that qualify for\nMSC-based bone repair and help identify the best source of\nand preparation protocol for human MSCs. It remains to be\ninvestigated whether the same formula can be applied suc-\ncessfully to MSC-based orthotopic bone repair in a preclini-\ncal model, where in addition to the properties intrinsic to the\ncell preparation, other factors such as inflammation and\nbiomechanics will influence bone formation.\nAlthough bone formation in vivo is relatively straightfor-\nward when MSCs are loaded onto matrices and then im-\nplanted subcutaneously in mice, the formation in vivo of\nstable hyaline-like cartilage resembling articular cartilage\nappears to be challenging when using MSCs. The chondro-\ngenic potential of MSCs is well known in vitro in high-cell-\ndensity pellets or micromass cultures but the key question as\nto whether the resulting cartilage-like tissue is stable carti-\nlage or a transient cartilage template destined to be replaced\nwith bone in a process of endochondral ossification is unre-\nsolved. Using a nude mouse assay of ectopic cartilage for-\nmation validated with intramuscular injection of adult\nhuman articular chondrocytes (Dell\u2019Accio et al., 2001), we\ndemonstrated that the in vitro chondrogenic potential of\nsynovial membrane-derived MSCs is not sufficient to pre-\ndict the in vivo outcome at least in this nude mouse model,\nbecause the synovial MSCs induced in vitro into a chon-\ndrocyte-like phenotype failed to form stable cartilage when\nimplanted in vivo (De Bari et al., 2004). Of note, Pelttari\nand colleagues reported that bone marrow MSC-derived\ncartilage pellets transplanted into ectopic sites in severe\ncombined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice underwent endo-\nchondral ossification, via premature induction of chondrocyte\nhypertrophy-related molecules such as type X collagen\n(Pelttari et al., 2006). More recently, Scotti and colleagues\n(2010) reported that human bone marrow MSCs, implanted\nsubcutaneously into nude mice at various stages of chon-\ndrogenic differentiation, formed bone only when they\nhad developed in vitro hypertrophic cartilage traits. The\nunderlying morphogenetic process was similar to limb bone\ndevelopment in embryos, thus revealing the capacity of hu-\nman MSCs to generate bone tissue via an endochondral\nprogram.\nAltogether, these studies suggest that the in vitro MSC-\nderived neoformed cartilage-like tissue is not stable. None-\ntheless, they do not rule out the possibility that, as opposed\nto an ectopic site, the joint environment of a cartilage defect\nmay instead be sufficient either to induce a stable cartilage\nphenotype or stabilize the chondrocyte-like phenotype of\nin vitro precommitted MSC populations. Uplift of the bone\nfront at the expense of the overlying articular cartilage has,\nhowever, been observed in osteochondral repair by bone\nmarrow cells (Qiu et al., 2003).\nMolecular Regulation of MSC Differentiation\nSeveral molecules have been reported to be involved in\nthe regulation of MSC differentiation. In this review we focus\non the main signaling pathways involved in the modulation\nof MSC differentiation but will also sketch out a concise\noverview of the transcription factors and the physical pa-\nrameters influencing the fate of MSCs. Because studies of\ndevelopmental biology have inspired a great deal of inves-\ntigation in the MSC field, we think it will be helpful to report\nkey findings in embryonic skeletogenesis before discussing\nthe relevant pathways in MSC differentiation. Our attention\nrevolves mainly around the Wnt canonical pathway and the\nTGF-b superfamily pathways.\nWnt signaling and MSC differentiation\nParticularly studied is the Wnt family of secreted proteins,\nreported to modulate bone mass in vivo and shown as acting\ndirectly on MSCs (Liu et al., 2009; Takada et al., 2009). Wnt\ngenes, a family of 19 genes in humans and mice, produce\nsecreted proteins that, for their involvement in cell prolifer-\nation, differentiation, and apoptosis, are crucial in embryonic\ntissue development and in regeneration of adult tissues in-\ncluding bone (Westendorf et al., 2004). Figure 1 shows a\nschematic diagram of the canonical b-catenin-dependent\nWnt signaling pathway (for a comprehensive review see\nGordon and Nusse, 2006).\nSeveral studies of developmental biology using mouse\ngenetics have revealed a critical role for Wnt in skeletogen-\nesis, and particularly in the formation of cartilage and bone.\nWe briefly review those studies that, in our opinion, are\nrelevant for an understanding of the molecular regulation of\nMSC differentiation.\nWnt and bone. Wnt proteins have a critical role in bone\ndevelopment and homeostasis. Gong and colleagues (2001)\ndemonstrated that the osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome\n(OPPG), a disorder characterized by low bone mass, ocular\ndefects, and predisposition to fractures, was caused by a loss-\nof-function mutation in the LRP5 (low-density lipoprotein\nreceptor-related protein-5) coreceptor. The production of\nLrp5\u2013\/\u2013 mice (Kato et al., 2002) and Lrp6\u2013\/\u2013 mice (Holmen\net al., 2004) allowed recapitulaton of these findings, with\nphenotypes similar to that of human OPPG. When the mu-\ntation of Lrp5 was involved, the disease was attributed to\ndecreased osteoblast proliferation. Interestingly, other mu-\ntations in the same gene can have different effects. As an\nexample, some individuals with high bone mass density bear\na gain-of-function mutation in Lrp5 (Boyden et al., 2002;\nLittle et al., 2002). Many studies followed these initial reports,\nindicating that loss-of-function mutations in the Lrp5 gene\ncould also affect bone formation via indirect mechanisms,\nsuch as Htr1b (5-hydroxytryptamine [serotonin] receptor-\n1B)\u2013CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) (Yadav\net al., 2008), but also that the gain-of-function mutation in\nLrp5 may not have an effect on bone density when expressed\nin mature osteoblasts (Yadav et al., 2008). It appears therefore\nthat Lrp5 could affect bone mass in a Wnt-independent way\nand that Lrp6 could be more relevant when considering Wnt\nsignaling in osteoblasts. When analyzing the Wnt pathway\nREGULATION OF MSC DIFFERENTIATION 3\ninvolved in bone development and homeostasis, it is ap-\nparent that each molecule involved can affect different fea-\ntures of bone mass regulation (for a comprehensive list of\nWnt-related factors and the in vivo effects caused by them,\nsee the review by Hoeppner and colleagues, 2009).\nWnt and cartilage. Wnt genes and proteins also act on\ncartilage differentiation, by interacting with cartilage-related\ntranscription factors. Day and colleagues (2005) showed that\nectopic canonical Wnt signaling led to enhanced ossification\nand suppression of chondrocyte formation during skeleto-\ngenesis. On the other hand, during both intramembranous\nand endochondral ossification, by genetic inactivation of\nb-catenin they induced ectopic chondrocyte formation in\nplace of osteoblast differentiation.\nIn the same year, Hill and colleagues (2005) demonstrated\nthat canonical Wnt signaling was essential for skeletal line-\nage differentiation, preventing transdifferentiation of osteo-\nblastic cells into chondrocytes, and also that b-catenin was\ncrucial in determining whether mesenchymal progenitors\nwould become osteoblasts in the developing embryo.\nDong and colleagues (2006) investigated the molecular\nmechanisms underlying canonical Wnt-mediated regulation\nof chondrocyte hypertrophy, using chick sternal chon-\ndrocytes, and provided evidence that in chick upper sternal\nchondrocytes activation of the canonical b-catenin Wnt sig-\nnaling pathway induces chondrocyte hypertrophy and\nmaturation and that Wnt\/b-catenin signaling is regulated by\nTGF-b and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2, and me-\ndiates chondrocyte hypertrophy at least partly through ac-\ntivation of Runx2, a transcription factor required for bone\nformation (Schroeder et al., 2005; Komori, 2010), which in\nturn may induce expression of collagen type X.\nMaruyama and colleagues (2010) observed endochondral\nossification in vivo in the skull of mice via knockout of Axin2,\na negative regulator of the WNT\/b-catenin pathway. The\nactivation of b-catenin cooperated with fibroblast growth\nfactor receptor-1 (FGFR1) to alter the lineage commitment of\nMSCs to differentiate into chondrocytes. In this way, instead\nof the expected intramembranous ossification, the switch in\nthe fate of MSCs to chondrocytes resulted in endochondral\nossification, abnormal suture morphogenesis, and fusion\nwith premature cranial gaps closure and a phenotype of\ncraniosynostosis. These findings suggest that the WNT\/\nb-catenin pathway is involved in controlling the stem cell\npopulation by regulating its renewal and proliferation, and\nin modulating lineage specification, in part by setting the\nbalance of the FGF and BMP pathways (Maruyama et al.,\n2010).\nWnt and MSCs. Attention has moved from osteoblasts to\nthe cells that likely originate them, the MSCs. Etheridge and\ncolleagues (2004) demonstrated that MSCs express a number\nof Wnt ligands, including Wnt2, Wnt4, Wnt5a, Wnt11, and\nWnt16, and several Wnt receptors, including FZD2, 3, 4, 5,\nand 6 as well as various coreceptors and Wnt inhibitors.\nBoland and colleagues (2004) showed that during osteogenic\ndifferentiation in vitro, MSCs upregulate a number of Wnt-\nrelated molecules while downregulating others. Moreover,\nthe same authors demonstrated that MSCs could respond to\nexogenous Wnt3, resulting in transient repression of osteo-\ngenesis. Similar results were obtained by Cho and colleagues\n(2006) using human adipose-derived MSCs. Using an in vitro\ndifferentiation culture system with human MSCs and per-\nforming global gene expression profiling on undifferentiated\nand differentiated MSCs, as well as on dedifferentiated cells\nderived from mesenchymal lineages, Song and colleagues\ndemonstrated that differentiated cells could dedifferentiate\ninto a primitive stem cell-like stage before transdifferentiat-\ning into another cell type (Song et al., 2006). In this study, the\nauthors identified a list of genes that were candidate markers\nof MSCs and may function to maintain stem cells in an un-\ncommitted state or to initiate their differentiation process.\nProminent among them were the genes associated with the\nWnt pathway.\nQuarto and colleagues (2010) reported that Wnt3a has\ndifferential effects when using different in vitro models and\nan in vivo model of bone regeneration; the effects were de-\npendent on the dose as well as the differentiation state of the\nrecipient cell. When added to undifferentiated MSCs, Wnt3a\ninhibited osteogenic differentiation. By contrast, when added\nto calvarial osteoblasts, Wnt3a at high doses had an inhibi-\ntory effect in cells from juvenile mice but induced bone\nproduction in cells from adult animals, as assessed by alka-\nline phosphatase activity and alizarin red mineralization\nassay. The defect repair was influenced once again both by\nFIG. 1. Schematic diagram of the ca-\nnonical Wnt signaling pathway.

These findings are in accordance with pre-\nvious investigations (Kahler and Westendorf, 2003; Kahler\net al., 2006, 2008; Eijken et al., 2008), showing that the effect of\ncanonical Wnt signaling on osteogenesis is influenced by the\ndifferentiation stage of target cells. Overall, canonical Wnt\nsignaling appears to stimulate the differentiation of MSCs\ncommitted to osteogenic lineage, while it inhibits the termi-\nnal differentiation of mature osteoblasts.\nIn a study on the effects of Wnt inhibitors on MSC chon-\ndrogenesis, Im and Quan (2010) found that in pellet cultures\nof human MSCs, inhibitors of the Wnt pathway promoted\nearly chondrogenesis of MSCs, but they lacked a synergistic\neffect with TGF-b in the longer term culture, and therefore\ndid not provide an ultimately enhancing role in the cartilage\ntissue engineering of MSCs.\nThe Wnt family and their regulation by microRNAs. Increas-\ning attention has been devoted to the interaction between\nmicroRNAs and the classical differentiation pathways. Al-\nthough many of such studies are on osteoblasts and not on\nundifferentiated MSCs, the results are relevant as they could\nbe translated to primary MSC cultures and, possibly, to\nin vivo scenarios. It was reported that the microRNA miR-29a\nis induced by canonical Wnt signaling and can potentiate\nWnt signaling (Kapinas et al., 2010). The microRNA miR-\n125b inhibited osteoblastic differentiation and proliferation\n(Mizuno et al., 2008). After it was demonstrated that miR-27\ncould influence adipogenesis and myogenesis (Feng et al.,\n2009; McDaneld et al., 2009), Wang and Xu (2010) reported\nthat the miR-27 microRNA is also able to interfere with the\ndifferentiation of a fetal osteoblastic cell line through Wnt\nsignaling modulation, by accumulation of b-catenin and re-\npression of adenomatous polyposis coli protein (APC) ex-\npression.\nTGF-b superfamily signaling pathways\nand MSC differentiation\nThe TGF-b superfamily consists of many growth factors\nand morphogens that have roles in developmental skeleto-\ngenesis and postnatal skeletal homeostasis. The TGF-b\nsuperfamily of ligands includes bone morphogenetic pro-\nteins (BMPs), growth and differentiation factors (GDFs), anti-\nmu\u00a8llerian hormone (AMH), Activin, Nodal, and TGF-b (Piek\net al., 1999; Derynck and Miyazono, 2008). Here, we con-\ncentrate on the TGF-b and BMP families, and on the effects\nthat they exert on the skeletal system and on MSCs (see Fig. 2\nfor a schematic representation of the TGF-b and BMP sig-\nnaling pathways).\nTGF-b family. The expression of growth factors of the\nTGF-b superfamily has been described in embryonic bone\nand cartilage development as well as during adult bone re-\npair (Hogan, 1996; Horner et al., 1998), and the chondro\/\nosteo-stimulatory\/modulatory effects of the TGF-bs as well\nas the BMPs have been well established in embryonic and\nadult mesenchymal cells ( Johnstone et al., 1998; Mackay et al.,\n1998; Denker et al., 1999; Barry et al., 2001; Majumdar et al.,\n2001; Noth et al., 2002; Sekiya et al., 2002). In particular, TGF-\nb has been used for years in in vitro assays of cartilage mi-\ncromasses or pellets starting from culture-expanded MSCs\n(Mackay et al., 1998; Pittenger et al., 1999), and has become a\nrequirement for these chondrogenesis assays. TGF-b pro-\nmotes cartilage-specific gene expression through intracellular\nsignaling cascades involving SMAD proteins, the mitogen-\nactivated protein (MAP) kinases, p38, extracellular-signal\nregulated kinase (ERK)-1, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK)\n(Lutz and Knaus, 2002; Schmierer and Hill, 2007).\nAfter thedemonstration of the crucial role of the cell adhesion\nprotein, N-cadherin, and Wnt signaling in mesenchymal\nFIG. 2.

This resulted in the modulation of N-\ncadherin expression levels, WNT-7A gene expression, and the\nconsequent Wnt-mediated signaling through the intracellular\nb-catenin pathway, with control of the condensation and early\nsteps of MSC chondrogenesis.\nBMP family. BMPs are involved in the developmental and\nhomeostatic processes of the bone and cartilage, as well as of\nother tissues (Katagiri and Miyazono, 2008). BMPs are\ncharacterized by a complex transduction pathway, based on\ntheir signaling through SMAD proteins 1, 5, 8, and 4 (re-\nviewed in Xiao et al. [2007] and in Miyazono et al. [2010]).\nBMPs are capable of inducing, in adult rodents, ectopic\ncartilage and bone formation, mimicking embryonic endo-\nchondral bone formation.\nBMPs are important morphogens regulating chon-\ndrogenesis and skeletogenesis during normal embryonic\ndevelopment (Hogan, 1996). Individual BMPs exhibit\ndistinct expression patterns in skeletal elements. Bmp-2 is\nexpressed in areas surrounding the initial cartilage conden-\nsations, periosteal and osteogenic zones, whereas Bmp-4 is\nexpressed in perichondrium. Bmp-6 is expressed in pre-\nhypertrophic chondrocytes. High levels of Bmp-7 mRNA\nhave been observed in the perichondrium, but its expression\nis absent in the zones of joint formation (Zhao et al., 2002;\nSekiya et al., 2005).\nThe effects of BMPs on MSCs have been investigated in\nseveral studies. Rickard and colleagues (1994) demonstrated\nthat rat bone marrow MSCs cultured in the presence of BMP-\n2 increased osteoblastic markers such as alkaline phospha-\ntase activity and expression of osteocalcin. This effect was\nstrengthened when culturing MSCs with BMP-2 and dexa-\nmethasone together. Several other studies analyzed the effect\nof BMP-2, along with other factors, on the proliferative and\nosteogenic abilities of primary or immortalized MSCs and\/\nor osteoblasts (Wang et al., 1993; Hanada et al., 1997; Lecanda\net al., 1997; Jorgensen et al., 2004). In 1999, Denker and col-\nleagues observed that the addition of BMP-2 to C3H10T1\/2\nmesenchymal cells in micromass cultures enhanced the ap-\npearance of chondrocytes. The effect of BMP-2 was appar-\nently modulated by N-cadherin, a Ca2\u00fe-dependent adhesion\nmolecule (Haas and Tuan, 1999). The addition of BMP-6 to\nmicromass cultures of human bone marrow MSCs enhanced\ncartilage formation compared with controls in a time- and\ndose-dependent fashion (Sekiya et al., 2001).\nIn a study in micromass culture, Sekiya and colleagues\n(2005) compared the chondrogenic effect of BMP-2, BMP-4,\nand BMP-6 on human bone marrow MSCs and observed that\nthe most potent chondroinductor was BMP-2. Analyzing\nmicroarray data from the micromasses cultured with the\nvarious BMPs, the authors found that only the MSCs cul-\ntured with BMP-2 expressed the cartilage synthesis-related\ngenes with the correct pattern and time sequence.\nUsing human MSCs from periosteum, we detected ex-\npression of BMP receptors and confirmed the chondrogenic\neffect of BMPs in micromass. However, BMP-2, BMP-4,\nBMP-7, and GDF-5\/CDMP-1 (cartilage-derived morphoge-\nnetic protein-1) were poorly chondrogenic in comparison\nwith TGF-b1 (De Bari et al., 2001a).\nBMP2 signaling can influence the Wnt pathway through\ninteraction between b-catenin and N-cadherin. Treatment of\nthe mesenchymal cell line C3H10T1\/2, in micromass culture\nwith lithium chloride, a mimetic of canonical Wnts that acts\nby inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3b serine\/\nthreonine phosphorylation activity, significantly inhibited\nBMP-2 stimulation of chondrogenesis (Fischer et al., 2002),\nand decreased the levels of N-cadherin protein and mRNA,\nprobably affecting mesenchymal condensation (see also\nTuan, 2003), a process characterized by increased cell density\nand cell\u2013cell adhesion and critical in the initiation of chon-\ndrogenic differentiation. In 2005, Modarresi and colleagues\n(2005) found that normal levels of N-cadherin expression\nwere essential, in micromass pellet cultures, to obtain proper\ntemporal MAP kinase and BMP-2 regulation of chondrogenic\ngenes such as type II collagen, aggrecan, and Sox9.\nEyckmans and colleagues (2010) highlighted a require-\nment for BMP and Wnt signaling in bone formation when\nusing human periosteum-derived MSCs seeded onto calcium\nphosphate carriers and implanted ectopically in immune-\ndeficient mice. The inhibition of endogenous BMP and Wnt\nsignaling by overexpression of the secreted antagonists\nNoggin and Frzb, respectively, abrogated osteoinduction.\nOther signaling molecules in MSC differentiation\nOther factors are known to influence the differentiation of\nMSCs. Many of them also interact, at different levels, with\nthe Wnt and\/or TGF-b\/BMP pathways. One of those factors,\nfibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, has been shown to promote\ncell proliferation and to maintain the MSC population in a\nprolonged undifferentiated state (Martin et al., 1997). Ng and\ncolleagues (2008) studied the transcriptional profiling of\nMSCs and of MSC-derived differentiated cells in order to\nidentify the factors implied in the differentiation processes\nin vitro. From their analysis, the authors highlighted three\npathways, centered on TGF-b, FGF-2, and platelet-derived\ngrowth factor (PDGF), which proved to be important in the\ngrowth and essential in the differentiation of MSCs. Fur-\nthermore, the authors were able to grow MSCs using a\ncombination of these growth factors in culture, under serum-\nfree conditions.\nPDGF has been shown to inhibit osteogenic differentiation\n(Gruber et al., 2004; Kratchmarova et al., 2005). In an elegant\nstudy, Kratchmarova and colleagues found that the osteo-\ngenic differentiation of human MSCs is stimulated by epi-\ndermal growth factor (EGF) but not PDGF. They used mass\nspectrometry-based proteomics to compare proteins that\nwere tyrosine phosphorylated in response to EGF and PDGF.\nMore than 90% of these signaling proteins were used by both\nligands, whereas the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)\npathway was activated exclusively by PDGF, implicating it\nas a possible control point. Indeed, chemical inhibition of\nPI3K in PDGF-stimulated cells removed the differential effect\nof the two growth factors, conferring full differentiation\neffect onto PDGF.\nNg and colleagues (2008) showed that inhibition of PDGF\nsignaling resulted, instead, in fewer osteocytes and the ab-\nsence of mineralized bone nodules, implying that under\nspecific conditions PDGF may be required for correct oste-\nogenic differentiation. Tokunaga and colleagues (2008)\nstudied the effects of the b receptor for PDGF, PDGFR-b, by\n6 AUGELLO AND DE BARI\nspecific PDGFR-b gene deletion using Cre\u2013loxP technology.\nDepletion of PDGFR-b in MSCs decreased the mitogenic and\nmigratory responses and enhanced osteogenic differentia-\ntion. In a mouse model of bone fracture, depletion of\nPDGFR-b significantly increased the ratio of woven bone to\ncallus. The effects of PDGFR-a on osteogenic differentiation\nwere instead very subtle. PDGFR-b could therefore represent\nan important target for bone tissue engineering.\nMSCs express EGF receptor (EGFR)\/ErbB-1, and EGF\nexerts mitogenic activity on MSCs (Krampera et al., 2005;\nTamama et al., 2006). The role of EGFR signaling in bone is\nnot well understood, with contrasting results having been\ndiscerned. Loss of EGFR signaling has been reported to ac-\ncelerate chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation in mice,\nsuggesting that EGFR signaling negatively regulates bone\ncell differentiation (Sibilia et al., 2003). Satomura and col-\nleagues reported that after transplantation of human MSC-\nloaded HA scaffolds, the MSCs able to form bone were\nfound to have consistently low expression of EGFR com-\npared with those MSCs not forming bone, although indi-\nvidual variability could not be disregarded (Satomura et al.,\n1998). Activation of EGFR is also associated with enhanced\nproliferation of the stem\/progenitor cell compartment with\nno impairment of differentiation (Krampera et al., 2005;\nTamama et al., 2006), or even enhancement of differentiation\n(Kratchmarova et al., 2005). A reversible EGF-driven en-\nhancement of in vitro osteogenic differentiation was de-\nscribed when incubating MSCs with tethered EGF (Platt et al.,\n2009), probably due to a consistent and continuous interac-\ntion between EGF and its receptor. This finding in particular\ncould lead to the development of novel bioscaffold-based\ntissue-engineering approaches exploiting the tethering of\nactive substances, such as EGF, that are never released from\nthe bioscaffold itself and are therefore constantly available to\ninduce an otherwise reversible differentiation process.\nOther signaling molecules are involved in the chondro\/\nosteogenic differentiation pathways. Scotti and colleagues\n(2010) linked the in vivo endochondral ossification obtained\nin ectopic implants in nude mice of in vitro-engineered\nhuman MSCs to the regulation of Indian hedgehog (IHH) as\nan upstream signal through its receptor Patched1 (PTCH1),\nand GLI1 as mediator of IHH signal transduction. All these\ngenes were either not expressed or expressed at low levels\nin culture-expanded MSCs, whereas their expression levels\nwere markedly increased in the early hypertrophic and\neven more in the late hypertrophic constructs, indicating\nthat the processes leading to endochondral ossification are\nequally regulated by the activation and\/or upregulation of\nthe signaling pathways involved in endochondral bone\nformation during embryonic limb skeletogenesis (Karsenty,\n2008).\nTranscription factors in MSC differentiation\nMany transcription factors (TFs) intervene in the control\nand regulation of the differentiation pathways of MSCs.\nOnce again, the developmental studies have provided an\neducational platform for investigations of the roles in MSC\ndifferentiation of those transcription factors that have been\nreported to be key regulators of embryonic skeletogenesis. In\nparticular, the main transcription factors intervening in os-\nteogenic differentiation are CBFA-1\/Runx2 and Osterix\n(Osx), known to be required for bone formation during de-\nvelopment (Schroeder et al., 2005; Komori, 2010), whereas\nSox9 is a transcription factor required for cartilage formation\n(Akiyama et al., 2004; Quintana et al., 2009). It must be said,\nhowever, that developmental studies have addressed in\ngreat detail the formation of cartilage that undergoes hy-\npertrophy and is replaced with bone during endochondral\nossification of limb development, whereas the molecular\nmachinery underlying the formation of stable articular car-\ntilage remains to be defined.\nDuring development, chondrogenesis is controlled by in-\nteractions between Sox9 and the Wnt\/b-catenin signaling\npathway. Either overexpression of Sox9 or inactivation of\nb-catenin in chondrocytes of mouse embryos in vivo pro-\nduced a similar phenotype of dwarfism with decreased\nchondrocyte proliferation, delayed hypertrophic chon-\ndrocyte differentiation, and endochondral bone formation\n(Akiyama et al., 2004). Furthermore, either inactivation of\nSox9 or stabilization of b-catenin in chondrocytes also re-\nsulted in a similar phenotype of severe chondrodysplasia.\nSox9 markedly inhibited activation of b-catenin-dependent\npromoters and stimulated degradation of b-catenin. Of note,\na physical interaction between b-catenin and the C-terminal\ntrans-activation domain of Sox9 was demonstrated.\nDong and colleagues (2006) observed upregulation of\ntype X collagen (col10a1) and Runx2 mRNA by viral over-\nexpression of Wnt8c and Wnt9a, thereby inducing chon-\ndrocyte hypertrophy. Wnt8c and Wnt9a strongly inhibited\nmRNA levels of Sox9 and type II collagen (col2a1). They also\nfound that Wnt8c further enhanced BMP-2-induced expres-\nsion of Runx2 and col10a1, whereas Wnt8c and Wnt9a in-\nhibited TGF-b-induced expression of Sox9 and col2a1. By\noverexpressing b-catenin, the authors upregulated Runx2,\ncol10a1, and alkaline phosphatase (AP) mRNA levels while\nthey inhibited col2a1 transcription; Wnt8c and b-catenin also\nacted at protein levels, inducing production of Runx2 in\nchondrocytes. These results link activation of the canonical\nWnt signaling pathway with chondrocyte hypertrophy and\nmaturation through the transcription factors Runx2 and\nSox9.\nKlees and colleagues (2005) found that adhesion of cul-\ntured MSCs to laminin-5 activated ERK, leading to phos-\nphorylation of Runx2\/CBFA-1. Majumdar and colleagues\n(2001) observed that in MSCs placed in alginate beads and\ncultured in serum-free medium with BMP-2 and BMP-9 there\nwas increased expression of Sox9 accompanied by an in-\ncrease in expression of mature chondrocyte markers such as\ntype II collagen.\nIt has been reported that RUNX2 and SOX9 physically\ninteract in MSCs and that SOX9 can inhibit the trans-activa-\ntion of RUNX2. In addition, RUNX2 exerts reciprocal inhi-\nbition on SOX9 trans-activity. SOX9 induced degradation of\nRUNX2, which was proteasome independent but phos-\nphorylation dependent, and required the presence of the\nRUNX2 C-terminal domain, which contains a nuclear ma-\ntrix-targeting sequence. Furthermore, SOX9 was able to de-\ncrease the level of ubiquitinated RUNX2 and direct RUNX2\nto the lysosome for degradation. SOX9 also directed b-\ncatenin for lysosomal breakdown (Cheng and Genever,\n2010). Thus, the reciprocal regulation between SOX9 and\nRUNX2, downstream of signaling pathways, will have ob-\nvious consequences on MSC fate.\nREGULATION OF MSC DIFFERENTIATION 7\nPhysical factors in MSC differentiation\nMSCs also interact physically with the surrounding envi-\nronment. Examples are numerous; here we cite but a few.\nThe first line of interaction for MSCs is with the extracellular\nenvironment, be it plastic, a resorbable bioscaffold, or a more\nrigid structure. Seminal in this sense is the study by Engler\nand colleagues (2006), showing that the extracellular matrix\ncan control stem cell fate, inducing seeded MSCs toward\nosteogenesis or chondrogenesis depending on its physical\nproperties. More recently, it was reported that manipulation\nof the membrane potential of cultured MSCs can influence\ntheir fate and differentiation (Sundelacruz et al., 2008, 2009).\nThese findings open up unprecedented avenues for the reg-\nulation of MSC differentiation in regenerative medicine us-\ning physical factors, without the use of exogenous growth\nfactors.\nConclusion\nThere is an increasing amount of data on the molecular\nregulation of MSC differentiation, and this review has ad-\ndressed only some of them (for a schematic overview see Fig.\n3). As already discussed previously, a caveat of the in vitro\nstudies relates to the known variability that is at least in part\ndue to culture conditions and the MSC type used. Therefore,\na priority in the MSC field is the standardization of isolation\nand culture expansion. This will minimize variability of\noutcome and will also allow proper comparison of studies.\nNonetheless, the availability of standardized in vitro assays\nemploying primary human MSCs has huge scientific and\nclinical potentials. The use of reporter assays for assessment\nof net signaling activation, three-dimensional culture sys-\ntems, and bioreactors with sensors monitoring MSC activity\nwill allow rapid progression from basic science to auto-\nmated, highly controlled cell-bioprocessing methods moni-\ntored via mathematical models through technological\nadvances in systems biology and network science. With this\nview, the investigation of MSC \u2018\u2018omics\u2019\u2019 as well as of the\ninfluence of the surrounding niches and contained signaling\nmolecules is of paramount importance. A deep knowledge of\nthe mechanisms underlying MSC differentiation will be\nparamount for the successful development of consistent\nMSC-based products in tissue engineering and regenerative\nmedicine.\nAcknowledgments\nSupported by MRC grant G108\/620.
