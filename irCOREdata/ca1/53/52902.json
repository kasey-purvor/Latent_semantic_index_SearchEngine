We have \nproposed that such biases may be used as indicators of animal emotional state. Here, \nwe use a spatial judgement task, in which animals are trained to expect food in one \nlocation and not another, to determine whether rats in relatively positive or negative \nemotional states respond differently to ambiguous stimuli of intermediate spatial \nlocation. We housed 24 rats with environmental enrichment for seven weeks. \nEnrichment was removed for half the animals prior to the start of training (\u2018U\u2019: \nunenriched) to induce a relatively negative emotional state, whilst being left in place \nfor the remaining rats (\u2018E\u2019: enriched). After six training days, the rats successfully \ndiscriminated between the rewarded and unrewarded locations in terms of an \nincreased latency to arrive at the unrewarded location, with no housing treatment \ndifference. The subjects then received three days of testing in which three ambiguous \n\u2018probe\u2019 locations, intermediate between the rewarded and unrewarded locations, were \nintroduced. There was no difference between the treatments in the rats\u2019 judgement of \ntwo out of the three probe locations, the exception being when the ambiguous probe \nwas positioned closest to the unrewarded location. This result suggests that rats \nhoused without enrichment, and in an assumed relatively negative emotional state, \nrespond differently to an ambiguous stimulus compared to rats housed with \nenrichment, providing evidence that cognitive biases may be used to assess animal \nemotional state in a spatial judgement task. \nKeywords: Laboratory rat, Rattus norvegicus, cognition, emotion, animal welfare \n 2\n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \nThe study of animal emotions is gaining increasing credence within the research \ncommunity including psychology, neuroscience and behaviour (e.g. Rolls, 2000; \nLeDoux, 2003; Paul et al., 2005). Furthermore, the assumption that animals \nexperience emotional states is likely to underpin public concern about animal welfare, \nand investigations of such states are thus of central importance in animal welfare \nscience (e.g. Dawkins, 1990; Mendl & Paul, 2004; Dawkins, 2006). Emotional states \nare widely regarded by contemporary emotion researchers as comprising subjective, \nbehavioural, physiological, and cognitive components (e.g. Winkielman et al., 1997; \nBradley & Lang, 2000; Paul et al., 2005). It is not currently possible to obtain direct \nmeasures of the subjective component of emotional experience. Therefore, when we \nrefer to animal emotion in this paper we cannot assume an accompanying conscious \nexperience, even if other components of the emotional response are present. \n \nCurrent methodologies for investigating emotions include the measurement of \nphysiological and behavioural \u2018indicators\u2019 of stress and welfare (e.g. Broom, 1991; \nHurst et al., 1999; Abou-Ismail et al., 2007; Burman et al., 2007) \u2013 measures that are \nassociated with putative aversive experiences. There are also many behavioural tests \nof fear and anxiety developed in neuroscience and psychopharmacology research (e.g. \nRamos & Morm\u00e8de, 1998; File & Seth, 2003; Paul et al., 2005), and tests that allow \nus to \u2018ask\u2019 an animal what it wants (preference tests (e.g. Sherwin, 1996; Dawkins, \n2003; Merrill et al., 2006)) or how much it wants it (consumer demand (e.g. Dawkins, \n1983; Warburton & Mason, 2003; Sherwin, 2007)), and hence may indicate emotional \nstates (e.g. \u2018suffering\u2019) in animals that are denied highly valued resources (Dawkins, \n1990). \n \n 3\n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n66 \n67 \n68 \n69 \n70 \n71 \n72 \n73 \nThere are, however, problems with the existing techniques. For many \nphysiological and behavioural indicators, interpretation is complicated by the fact that \nthe correspondence between a particular measure (e.g. heart rate\/locomotory \nbehaviour) and the valence (i.e. positive\/negative) of a corresponding emotional state \nmay be unclear. For example, increased heart rate or locomotory behaviour may be \nrecorded during aversive (e.g. predator avoidance) or pleasurable (e.g. sex) activities. \nRelated to this, there is a lack of clear a priori predictions for how responses in some \ntests (e.g. tests of spontaneous behaviour such as the open field) reflect emotional \nstate (e.g. is activity in the open field an indicator of curiosity-motivated exploration \nor fear-motivated escape?), making implementation and interpretation of such tests in \nspecies other than the ones for which they were developed necessarily post-hoc. A \nthird issue is that there tends to be a bias towards the study of negative emotions (e.g. \nPaul et al., 2005; Boissy et al., 2007) with positive emotions receiving far less \nresearch attention. The development of further methodologies for assessing positive as \nwell as negative affective states would therefore be advantageous. \n \nFor these reasons, consideration has been given to alternative methods of \nmeasuring emotional state that may avoid some of these technical or interpretative \nissues. One such alternative is the study of cognitive bias (Paul et al., 2005). There is \na large body of evidence in the human psychology literature that background \nemotional state can influence the cognitive processes of individuals, resulting in \nbiases in processes including judgement, attention, and memory (Paul et al., 2005). \nFor example, anxious individuals bias their attention to threatening stimuli (Mogg & \nBradley, 1998) and make more negative interpretations of ambiguous stimuli (e.g. \nEysenck et al., 1991). The benefits of using cognitive bias as an indicator of emotional \n 4\n74 \n75 \n76 \n77 \n78 \n79 \n80 \n81 \n82 \n83 \n84 \n85 \n86 \n87 \n88 \n89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \nstate include the ability to discriminate between emotional states of different valence \n(e.g. depression, pleasure), and potentially even between emotional states of the same \nvalence (e.g. anxiety, depression), and the presence of clear and generalisable a priori \npredictions for how response and emotional state are related (Paul et al., 2005). \n \nIn a previous study (Harding et al., 2004), the authors developed a test of \njudgement bias, one category of cognitive bias (Paul et al., 2005), in which rats were \ntrained to press a lever to gain a food reward after a particular tone had been played \n(e.g. 2kHz), but to refrain from pressing the lever when a different tone (e.g. 4kHz) \nwas played in order to avoid a burst of white noise. Having learned to discriminate \nbetween these two \u2018reference\u2019 tones, half the rats were subjected to an unpredictable \nhousing treatment (e.g. Harkin et al., 2002) before all the rats were tested and their \nresponses recorded to the playback of various ambiguous \u2018probe\u2019 stimuli of tonal \nfrequencies intermediate to the two \u2018reference\u2019 tones (i.e. 2.5kHz, 3kHz, 3.5kHz). The \nprediction was that those rats that had experienced the unpredictable housing \ntreatment would consequently be in a relatively negative emotional state, and so \nwould be more likely than control animals to respond to the ambiguous tones as \nthough they predicted the negative rather than the positive outcome (operationally \ndefined as a \u2018pessimistic\u2019 response). This was borne out by the results (Harding et al., \n2004). \n \nA novel finding of this nature requires replication and investigation of its \ngenerality, as well as further study due to its potential not only for practical uses in the \nassessment of animal emotion, but also for elucidating the processes involved in the \ninteractions between cognition and emotion. There is also a need to develop other \n 5\n99 \n100 \n101 \n102 \n103 \n104 \n105 \n106 \n107 \n108 \n109 \n110 \n111 \n112 \n113 \n114 \n115 \n116 \n117 \n118 \n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \nmeans of testing judgement bias in non-human animals that are quicker to implement \nand require less specialist technology and skill\/knowledge (Bateson & Matheson, \n2007). In this study we therefore decided to further investigate this promising \napproach using location as the cue instead of auditory tones, as spatial location has a \nstrong salience in cognitive tasks for many animals including laboratory rats because \nof its ecological relevance to contexts such as foraging behaviour (e.g. Olton & \nSamuelson, 1976; Wood et al., 1999; Thorpe et al., 2002). In order to manipulate \nbackground emotional state we decided to use the presence or absence of \nenvironmental enrichment, as there is plentiful evidence that the presence of \nenvironmental enrichment can result in an improvement in welfare, and therefore an \nassociated positive emotional state (and vice versa for the absence of enrichment). For \ninstance, previous research has indicated that the presence of environmental \nenrichment can reduce stress for many species, as determined by behavioural, \nphysiological and pathological indicators (e.g. Van Loo et al., 2002; Burman et al., \n2006; Hansen et al., 2007) and can also result in decreased levels of indices of \nnegative emotional state such as fearfulness and anxiety (i.e. \u2018anxiolytic\u2019 effects of \nenrichment (e.g. Fernandez-Teruel et al., 2002; Fox et al., 2006)). \n \nOur aim was therefore to determine the generality of the cognitive bias \napproach using a novel, ecologically-based, location judgement bias task in laboratory \nrats. We predicted that animals in an assumed negative emotional state (i.e. \nexperiencing absence\/removal of enrichment) would be more likely to show a \npessimistic-like bias in their judgement of ambiguous locations (i.e. responding to \nambiguous locations as if they were unrewarded rather than rewarded), while animals \nin an assumed positive emotional state (i.e. in the presence of enrichment), would be \n 6\n124 \n125 \n126 \n127 \n128 \n129 \n130 \n131 \n132 \n133 \n134 \n135 \n136 \n137 \n138 \n139 \n140 \n141 \n142 \n143 \n144 \n145 \n146 \n147 \n148 \nmore likely to show an optimistic-like bias (i.e. responding to ambiguous locations as \nif they were rewarded rather than unrewarded). \n \nMETHODS \n \nSubjects \n \nWe used twenty four male Lister-hooded rats (Harlan, UK), approximately six \nmonths old at the start of testing. The rats were randomly allocated to groups of three \nand housed in standard cages (33cm X 50cm X 21cm) on a 12hr reversed light cycle, \nlights off 0800-2000, with food (Harlan Teklad Laboratory Diet) and water available \nad libitum. Subjects were not food deprived or restricted in this study. The housing \nroom was maintained at a constant temperature (20\u02daC\u00b11\u02da) and relative humidity \n(46%), with a 60W red light bulb allowing the researcher to see the animals. Rats \ncould be individually identified by natural variation in their coat markings. \n \nApparatus \n \nIn a different room from that in which the rats were housed, we constructed a \ncircular arena (122cm circumference, 60cm height) made of white opaque Perspex \nwith a wooden start box (24cm x 22cm x 20cm) which had a manually-operated \nguillotine door that opened into the arena. The arena was lit by a centrally-located dim \nwhite light (25W) and placed at floor level. Two goal pots were constructed out of \nblack plastic tubes (43mm diameter) with a bend at a 135\u02da angle with the tube opening \n40mm high. These were attached to a clear Perspex base (14cm x 10cm 1cm) to \n 7\n149 \n150 \n151 \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n156 \n157 \n158 \n159 \n160 \n161 \n162 \n163 \n164 \n165 \n166 \n167 \n168 \n169 \n170 \n171 \n172 \n173 \nprevent tipping. Wire mesh disks were placed at the bottom of each tube so that food \npellets (45mg Dustless Precision Pellets, Bio-Serv) could be placed above (accessible \nto the rats) or below (inaccessible to the rats, but in close olfactory contact) the mesh \n(see Figure One). This allowed us to control for olfactory discrimination of the reward \nlocations. The goal pots were visually identical, used interchangeably and provided a \nclear end point (i.e. movement of head into goal pot; see below) that indicated the \nrat\u2019s decision to access a reward. \n \nFigure One \n \nIn any trial or test, one pot was placed in the arena in one of five possible \nlocations. The two \u2018reference\u2019 locations (rewarded or unrewarded) were equidistant \nfrom the start box (80cm) and from the side of the arena (21cm), and were positioned \n80cm apart. The three ambiguous \u2018probe\u2019 locations were distributed at intermediate \npoints between the two reference locations, separated by 20cm, such that one probe \nwas located midway between the two reference locations, and the other two probes \nhalfway between the central probe and each reference location (see Figure Two). \nBecause the goal pots were continually removed for cleaning between trials, all the \nlocations were marked on the floor of the arena using a permanent marker pen at least \n12 hours prior to the next trial. \n \nFigure Two \n \nTo let the rats into the arena from the start box, the guillotine door was \noperated manually using a pulley system behind a screen so that the researcher was \n 8\n174 \n175 \n176 \n177 \n178 \n179 \n180 \n181 \n182 \n183 \n184 \n185 \n186 \n187 \n188 \n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \n193 \n194 \n195 \n196 \n197 \n198 \nnot visible to the subjects during training\/testing. Also behind the screen were a video \nrecorder and monitor linked to a video camera allowing the subjects to be recorded \nand their behaviour observed remotely. \n \nTreatments \n \nAll the rats were initially housed in standard (33cm x 50cm x 21cm) cages \nwith the following enrichment items: sawdust bedding, shredded paper nesting \nmaterial, red Perspex shelter (Lillico, UK), an aspen block and compacted cotton \n\u2018Nestlets\u2019 (Lillico, UK)), for seven weeks prior to the start of the experiment. These \nenrichment items were selected on the basis of the results of a previous study \n(Burman et al., 2006) that indicated significant behavioural and physiological benefits \nof these same enrichment items, indicating enhanced welfare. The rats had previously \nbeen used (three months earlier) in a study of incentive contrast and so cages were \nrandomly allocated between the two different treatments in order to minimize any \npotential influence of previous experience. The day before habituation to the test \napparatus, half the rats (4 cages of 3 rats, n=12) continued to be housed in enriched \ncages (\u2018E\u2019: enriched) with the addition of a sisal rope hung across the cage, while the \nremainder (n=12) had the enrichments removed (\u2018U\u2019: unenriched) and were housed \nwith just sawdust bedding for the duration of the experiment (4 weeks). The \nprediction was that previous exposure to an enriched environment increases the \nnegative consequences of being subsequently housed without enrichment, as indicated \nin previous research (e.g. Day et al., 2002; Latham & Mason, 2006; Bateson & \nMatheson, 2007). At the end of the study, all rats were housed with enrichment items. \n \n 9\n199 \n200 \nProcedure \n \n201 \n202 \n203 \n204 \n205 \n206 \n207 \n208 \n209 \n210 \n211 \n212 \n213 \n214 \n215 \nPre-exposure to the apparatus \n \nRats were pre-exposed to the apparatus for three days. On the first pre-\nexposure day (0900hrs) we placed all three rats from each cage into the arena at the \nsame time for 5min, having previously randomly scattered 15 food pellets on to the \nfloor of the arena. Before each trial the floor of the arena was sprayed and mopped \nwith 70% alcohol solution. For the second pre-exposure day, we placed each rat in to \nthe arena on its own for 5mins, having previously randomly scattered five pellets onto \nthe floor of the arena. On the final pre-exposure day we repeated the procedure for \nday two. With the exception of two rats, all the rats ate all of the food pellets in each \nof the pre-exposure trials and produced no faeces (a suggested measure of \nstress\/anxiety (e.g. Ferre et al., 1995)). One rat only ate four food pellets on the \nsecond pre-exposure day, but ate all five pellets on the final pre-exposure day, and \nanother rat ate all the food pellets but produced faeces on all three pre-exposure trials. \n \n216 \n217 \n218 \n219 \n220 \n221 \n222 \n223 \nTraining \n \nFollowing the third pre-exposure day, the rats were trained and tested in two \nbatches, with each batch trained\/tested on alternate days. Treatments (\u2018E\u2019: enriched; \n\u2018U\u2019: unenriched) were counterbalanced between the two batches, and the order of \ntraining\/testing was counterbalanced within batch, and for each rat within treatment. \nIn each training trial only one goal pot was present, either in the rewarded location \n(containing two accessible pellets) or in the unrewarded location (containing two \n 10\n224 \n225 \n226 \n227 \n228 \n229 \n230 \n231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \n237 \n238 \n239 \n240 \n241 \n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n248 \ninaccessible pellets). For half the rats in each treatment the rewarded location was to \nthe left of the start box and the unrewarded location to the right, whereas for the other \nhalf it was the reverse (see Figure Two). During training, subjects received 12 trials \nper day, half rewarded and half unrewarded. \n \nThe training schedules\/sequences for each day were as follows: (1) Day 1: in \norder to make it easier for the rats to learn the discrimination, for trials 1-8 the goal \npot was in the same location for two consecutive trials and was then placed in the \nopposite location for the next two trials (e.g. ++--++--), starting with the rewarded \nlocation. For trials 9-12, the goal pot changed location with each trial. (2) From day 2 \nonwards (until criterion was achieved): we used a pseudo-random sequences with no \nmore than two consecutive presentations of the goal pot in the same location, and \nequal numbers of both locations in trials 1-6 and trials 7-12 (e.g. +--++--+-++-). \n \nBefore each trial the floor of the arena was sprayed and mopped with 70% \nalcohol solution and the goal pots removed and cleaned with 70% alcohol solution \nbefore being returned to the appropriate location with either an accessible or \ninaccessible reward according to the training\/testing schedule. Rats were transported \nbetween the housing room and test room in their home cages, placed into the start box \nfor the 2min inter-trial interval (ITI) while the home cage was returned to the housing \nroom. Once the 2min ITI had finished, the guillotine door was opened and the rat was \nable to emerge into the arena and the time was recorded for the rat to place any part of \nits head (from nose onwards) into the goal pot. Once this had occurred, the rat was \nreturned to the start box for the 2min ITI, during which the arena was cleaned and \nprepared for the next trial. The first trial of the first training day was open-ended and \n 11\n249 \n250 \n251 \n252 \n253 \n254 \n255 \ncontinued until the rat had eaten the food pellets. For the rest of the trials there was a \ncut-off point of 2mins, and if the rat failed to put its head into the goal pot in this time, \nit was returned to the start box for the 2min ITI and the arena prepared for the next \ntrial as normal. Once the rat had completed all 12 trials it was returned to its home \ncage, and the start-box as well as the floor and walls of the arena were cleaned before \nthe next rat was collected. \n \n256 \n257 \n258 \n259 \n260 \n261 \n262 \n263 \n264 \n265 \n266 \n267 \n268 \n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \n273 \nTesting \n \nOnce the rats had successfully discriminated between the reference locations, \nas determined by showing a significant difference in their latency to arrive at the \nrewarded and unrewarded locations (see \u2018Results\u2019), they were tested for three days \nduring which subjects were exposed to each of the three ambiguous locations once per \nday, interspersed within a sequence of rewarded and unrewarded locations. The \ntesting schedule for each day consisted of 13 trials in total, with five rewarded trials, \nfive unrewarded trials, and the three (unrewarded) ambiguous locations (one trial \neach). The three ambiguous trials were positioned at trial 5, trial 9 and trial 13, and the \norder in which they were presented was counterbalanced over the three test days. The \noverall sequence consisted of alternate single rewarded and unrewarded trials, starting \neither with a rewarded trial or an unrewarded trial, counterbalanced between \ntreatments. This testing schedule\/sequence was designed so that there were equal \nnumbers of ambiguous trials that followed immediately after a rewarded trial as \nfollowed immediately after an unrewarded trial, and to ensure that this was the same \nfor both treatments. \n \n 12\n274 \n275 \n276 \n277 \n278 \n279 \n280 \n281 \n282 \n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \n287 \n288 \n289 \n290 \n291 \n292 \n293 \n294 \n295 \n296 \n297 \n298 \nThe ambiguous locations were baited with two inaccessible food pellets (i.e. \nunrewarded) so as to minimise any (undesirable) associations between the ambiguous \nlocations and reward outcomes that may have been learned rapidly if the ambiguous \nprobe locations had been rewarded. The number of 50kHz ultrasonic vocalizations, \ncommonly emitted during the experience or in anticipation of \u2018positive\u2019 events (e.g. \nKnutson et al., 2002; Burman et al., 2007), was recorded during the probe trials (Mini-\n3 detector, Ultra Sound Advice). \n \nData analysis \n \nUnless indicated in the text, all data met the requirements for parametric tests \n(e.g. normality, homogeneity of variance etc.) either in an untransformed or \ntransformed state. Data for individual animals were averaged for each cage in case \nrats from the same cage performed more similarly in the individual tests as a result of \nhaving received the housing treatments together (n=4\/treatment). The statistics \npackage used was SPSS version 14. \n \nRESULTS \n \nTraining \n \nFor the training analysis we calculated the average latency to arrive at the goal \npot on the six rewarded trials and on the six unrewarded trials for each rat\/day, with \nthe exception of the first day of training in which the open-ended first trial (to the \nrewarded location) was excluded (see earlier). One rat from the unenriched treatment \n 13\nwas removed from the experiment because it never learned to obtain food from the \ngoal pot. We continued to train the rats until their average latency to arrive at the \nunrewarded location began to increase, and this was clearly observed after the sixth \nday of training (see Figure Three). At this point we tested to see if there was a \nsignificant difference between the latencies to arrive at the rewarded and unrewarded \nlocations. Group average performance, rather than any individual criterion, was used \nto ensure that all animals experienced the housing treatments for the same length of \ntime before the start of testing. We used a repeated measures General Linear Model \n(GLM) with Treatment (enriched vs. unenriched) as a between subject factor, and \nLocation (unrewarded vs. rewarded) and Day (1-6) as within subjects factors. We \nobserved a significant Day effect (F\n299 \n300 \n301 \n302 \n303 \n304 \n305 \n306 \n307 \n308 \n309 \n310 \n311 \n312 \n313 \n314 \n315 \n316 \n317 \n318 \n319 \n320 \n321 \n322 \n323 \n5,30=25.93, P=0.000), and a significant Location \neffect (F1,6=34.22, P=0.001) but no significant difference in approach times between \nthe treatments, either as a main effect (F1,6=2.2, P=0.189) or interaction (all P>0.1). \nPost-hoc analysis of the Day and Location main effects revealed that all rats ran \nsignificantly slower on the first day of training compared to subsequent days, and \nconsistently faster to the rewarded location (see Figure Three). Testing was therefore \nimplemented after day 6. \n \nFigure Three \n \nTesting \n \nTesting was carried out over three days for each rat, with five rewarded and \nfive unrewarded trials, and one trial for each of the three \u2018probe\u2019 locations per day. \nFor the test analysis we calculated the average time taken to arrive at the food pot \n 14\nlocation for the 15 rewarded trials and the 15 unrewarded trials, and the average value \nof the three trials for the different \u2018probe\u2019 locations for each rat. Because of this \ndifference in the number of trials for the different locations, we analysed probe and \nreference locations separately. One rat was excluded from subsequent analyses \nbecause it ran faster for the negative than the positive location. Our first analysis was \nto determine whether or not the animals responded differently to the reference \nlocations during testing, and whether this response differed between the two \ntreatments. As expected, we found a highly significant difference between the \nlatencies to approach the two locations, with rats taking longer to reach the \nunrewarded location (Repeated measures GLM: F\n324 \n325 \n326 \n327 \n328 \n329 \n330 \n331 \n332 \n333 \n334 \n335 \n336 \n337 \n338 \n339 \n340 \n341 \n342 \n343 \n344 \n345 \n346 \n347 \n348 \n1,6=55.29, P=0.000), but we found \nno treatment difference, either as a main effect (F1,6=0.032, P=0.864) or as an \ninteraction with location (F1,6=0.005, P=0.944). \n \nOur next analysis was to determine whether or not the animals responded differently \nto the probe locations during testing, and whether this response differed between the \ntwo treatments. In order to take into account individual differences in performance \n(i.e. in the latency to approach the reference locations), we calculated the average \nvalue between the time taken to reach the rewarded and unrewarded locations during \ntesting for each rat (averaged for each cage), and this was used as a covariate in the \nanalysis. We found that whilst there was no overall significant main effect of either \nTreatment (repeated measures GLM: F1,5=3.17, P=0.135), or Probe (F2,4=5.76, \nP=0.066), there was a significant Probe*Treatment interaction (F2,4=7.16, P=0.048), \nindicating that there was a difference between the treatments in the latency to \napproach the different probe locations. \n \n 15\nIn order to investigate this significant interaction between Probe and Treatment, we \nused a univariate GLM to compare between treatments for each probe separately, with \naverage latency to the reference locations as a covariate (see above). For the probe \nnearest the unrewarded location the difference between the treatments approached \nsignificance, with rats in the unenriched treatment taking longer to approach the probe \n(F\n349 \n350 \n351 \n352 \n353 \n354 \n355 \n356 \n357 \n358 \n359 \n360 \n361 \n362 \n363 \n364 \n365 \n366 \n367 \n368 \n369 \n370 \n371 \n372 \n373 \n1,4=5.45, P=0.08), but we found no differences between the treatments for either the \nmiddle probe (F1,4=0.17, P=0.705) or the probe nearest the rewarded location \n(F1,4=0.116, P=0.751). There were also no significant differences between the probe \nlocations when compared for each treatment separately using a repeated measures \nGLM (enriched: F2,4=1.39, P=0.348; unenriched: F2,4=2.22, P=0.225). It therefore \nappears that it was the difference between the treatments at the probe location nearest \nthe unrewarded location that made the most significant contribution to the overall \ninteraction effect (see Figure Four). \n \nFigure Four \n \nDuring testing we found no significant differences in 50kHz USV emission either \nbetween the probes (F2,12=1.271, P=0.316), the treatments (F1,6=2.316, P=0.179), or \nthe interaction between these two factors (F2,12=2.48, P=0.125). However, only 11\/23 \nrats emitted 50kHz USVs during exposure to the three probe locations, and of these \nindividuals, 7\/11 emitted USVs for all three probe locations. \n \n \nDISCUSSION \n \n 16\n374 \n375 \n376 \n377 \n378 \n379 \n380 \n381 \n382 \n383 \n384 \n385 \n386 \n387 \n388 \n389 \n390 \n391 \n392 \n393 \n394 \n395 \n396 \n397 \n398 \nTraining \n \nWe observed that after six days, if not before, the rats were able to \ndiscriminate between the rewarded and unrewarded locations, as demonstrated by \ndifferences in their time taken to approach the goal pot. This confirms the use of \nspatial location as a discriminatory stimulus for laboratory rodents (e.g. Olton & \nSamuelson, 1976). The fact that there was no difference in training performance \nbetween the two treatments (enriched vs. unenriched) suggests that there was no \ndifference in either the level of food motivation, learning ability or general activity \nand locomotory behaviour as a consequence of being housed either with or without \nenrichment. Any differences between the treatments during testing are therefore \nunlikely to be due to alterations in arousal or motivational state induced by the \ntreatments (e.g. chronically stressed animals may be less reward motivated, or \n\u2018anhedonic\u2019), as has been previously postulated (cf. Phillips & Barr, 1997). \n \nTesting \n \nDuring testing there continued to be no difference between the enriched and \nunenriched rats in the time taken to approach the two reference locations, indicating \nthat, as observed during training, the treatments did not appear to influence the rats\u2019 \nresponses to the learned reference locations. However, when we compared the rats\u2019 \nresponses to the ambiguous probe locations, we found a significant interaction effect \nbetween housing treatment and probe location. Rats housed without enrichment \nshowed no difference compared to enriched rats in their response to the probes located \neither half-way between the rewarded and unrewarded locations or nearest to the \n 17\n399 \n400 \n401 \n402 \n403 \n404 \n405 \n406 \n407 \n408 \n409 \n410 \n411 \n412 \n413 \n414 \n415 \n416 \n417 \n418 \n419 \n420 \n421 \n422 \n423 \nrewarded location. However, they ran slower than the enriched rats to the probe \nlocated nearest to the unrewarded location, suggesting that they were more likely to \nanticipate a lack of reward at that specific ambiguous location than the enriched rats. \nUnenriched rats were thus less likely to show an optimistic-like bias than enriched rats \nin their judgement of the ambiguous location positioned closest to the location where \nthey had learned not to expect a reward. This finding supports our general prediction \nthat animals housed without enrichment, and consequently in a putative negative \naffective state, would show a more negatively biased judgement of ambiguous stimuli \n(Paul et al., 2005). It also adds to the data indicating that non-linguistic tasks for \nassessing cognitive bias may be useful indicators of emotion in rats (Harding et al., \n2004), starlings (Bateson & Matheson, 2007; Matheson et al., 2007), and humans \n(Paul, E., Cuthill, I., Kuroso, G., Noroton, V., Woodgate, J. & Mendl, M. \nUnpublished data). \n \nPrevious studies in rats (Harding et al., 2004) and starlings (Bateson & \nMatheson, 2007) revealed an apparent reduced expectation of the occurrence of a \npositive event in animals experiencing a putatively more negative affective state (i.e. a \ndifference in the judgement of those ambiguous stimuli most similar to the positively \nreinforced stimulus). In contrast, our results, similar to those of Matheson et al., \n(2007), suggest that a background negative emotional state may also increase the \nexpectation of the occurrence of a negative (or less positive) event (i.e. a difference in \nthe judgement of those ambiguous stimuli most similar to the negatively reinforced \nstimulus) \u2013 at least relative to animals with a background positive emotional state. \nThese interpretations are based upon the relative proximity of the ambiguous probes \nto either the \u2018negative\u2019 or \u2018positive\u2019 reference stimuli, with the subjects\u2019 expectation \n 18\n424 \n425 \n426 \n427 \n428 \n429 \n430 \n431 \n432 \n433 \n434 \n435 \n436 \n437 \n438 \n439 \n440 \n441 \n442 \n443 \n444 \n445 \n446 \n447 \nof reward outcome for a particular ambiguous probe assumed to be generalized most \nstrongly from the reference stimulus that it most closely resembles. However, it may \nbe that both diametrical interpretations are equally likely - regardless of the relative \nposition of the ambiguous probe - such that animals running slower to a particular \nprobe could be interpreted either as demonstrating an increased expectation of a \nnegative outcome or a decreased expectation of a positive outcome. \n \nPutative differences in the similarly valenced negative emotional states of depression \nand anxiety include the suggestion that depression may be associated with decreased \nanticipation of positive events, whilst anxiety may be associated with increased \nanticipation of negative events (MacLeod et al., 1997). This could therefore suggest \nthat the background negative emotional state generated in this study was anxiety \nrather than depression related, although further research is required to investigate this. \nSpeculating, it is conceivable that absence\/removal of the shelter in the unenriched \ntreatment could lead to increased anxiety related to a more exposed \/ unprotected \nenvironment. \n \nIt is also noticeable that mean response latencies to probe locations were generally \nmore similar to the mean responses to the trained rewarded, as opposed to \nunrewarded, location (see Figure Four). One possible explanation for this is that, \nbecause the \u2018negative\u2019 outcome in this study was only a lack of reward rather than any \nspecific punishment, the subjects\u2019 judgement of ambiguity, regardless of housing \ntreatment, may have been skewed in favour of a positive outcome (i.e. resulting in a \nrunning speed similar to that for the rewarded location). This issue could be addressed \n 19\n448 \n449 \n450 \n451 \n452 \n453 \n454 \n455 \n456 \n457 \n458 \n459 \n460 \n461 \n462 \n463 \n464 \n465 \n466 \n467 \n468 \n469 \n470 \n471 \n472 \nin future studies by using a more \u2018negative\u2019 outcome (e.g. unpalatable food) rather \nthan the lack of reward as used here. \n \nAlthough we found differences between the treatments in latency to approach the \ndifferent ambiguous probe locations, we failed to observe similar differences in the \nemission of 50kHz USVs. This result failed to meet our prediction that, because \n50kHz USVs appear to indicate a positive emotional state in the vocalizer (e.g. \nKnutson et al., 2002; Burman et al., 2007), the rats\u2019 anticipation of a reward would be \nreflected in both the time taken for them to reach the probe location and the number of \nUSV emissions. One explanation for this result is that too few of the rats produced \nUSVs to generate a meaningful comparison. What we did observe, however, was that \nthere seemed to be a clear difference between rats, either they were vocalizers or non-\nvocalizers. \n \nDespite the preponderance of evidence for the anxiolytic effects of \nenvironmental enrichment (e.g. Fox et al., 2006 (review)), non-emotional \nexplanations for our results should also be considered (Fernandez-Teruel et al., 2002). \nThe provision of enrichment has been shown to improve learning and memory (e.g. \nRosenzweig & Bennett, 1996), and so, for this reason, we might have expected \nenriched rats to learn faster than unenriched rats. If so, we would have expected \nenriched rats to learn more rapidly that the probes did not contain food, and hence to \nshow a greater slowing of their running speeds. This was not observed. Furthermore, \nwe found no differences between the treatments, either during training or testing, in \nthe ability to discriminate between the reference stimuli. \n \n 20\n473 \n474 \n475 \n476 \n477 \n478 \n479 \n480 \n481 \n482 \n483 \n484 \n485 \n486 \n487 \n488 \n489 \n490 \n491 \n492 \n493 \n494 \n495 \n496 \n497 \nTo conclude, we observed a treatment difference in the judgement of one of \nthree ambiguous locations in a novel judgement bias task, with unenriched rats \ndisplaying a \u2018less optimistic-like\u2019 judgement of an ambiguous location - provided that \nambiguous location was close to a \u2018reference\u2019 location it had previously learned to be \nunrewarded - compared to rats housed with enrichment. This result suggests that the \nnovel judgement bias technique might be useful as an indicator of subtle changes in \nbackground emotional state, a critical target of animal welfare research, and has the \npotential benefit of being adaptable for other animal species. \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \nThis work was funded by the BBSRC Animal Welfare Initiative, and carried out \nunder Home Office licence (PPL 30\/2249).
