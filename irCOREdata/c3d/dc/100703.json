INTRODUCTION\nThe application of projectile fragmentation reactions at\nintermediate and relativistic energies to studies of nuclei far\nfrom stability has made substantial progress over the last few\nyears. The main feature of this technique\u2014namely, kinemati-\ncal focusing allowing the fast and chemically insensitive\nseparation of products in a magnetic spectrometer, coupled\ntogether with complete and unambiguous identification in-\nflight of each individual ion\u2014results in an extremely sensi-\ntive selection of rare residual channels, as demonstrated by\nthe recent identification of the long sought after doubly\nmagic nuclei 50\n100Sn50 @1#, 28\n78Ni50 @2#, and 28\n48Ni20 @3#. As a\nconsequence, this technique has been chosen as the basis of\none of the two complementary types of second-generation\nradioactive beam facilities which are currently being\nplanned.\n*Corresponding author.

The combination of sensitivity and universal-\nity offered by projectile fragment separators, together with\nefficient, delayed gamma-ray spectroscopy of the selected\nand identified ions in metastable states, opens attractive pos-\nsibilities for obtaining nuclear structure information on nu-\nclei far from the stability line which are presently inacces-\nsible with other experimental techniques. Although this\nmethod is limited to decays of isomeric states with half-lives\nbetween approximately 10 ns and 1 ms, its application has\nalready provided interesting results. For example, the identi-\nfication of the 81 isomer in 78Zn @12# establishes this as the\nclosest nucleus to the doubly magic 78Ni with known excited\nstates. The results from that experiment support the idea that\nN550 is a closed shell for nickel isotopes. Another example\nis the observed decay of a Kp5(102) isomer in 190W, which\nrepresents the most neutron-rich tungsten isotope with iden-\ntified excited states @13# and puts new limits on the region of\nK isomers for heavy transitional isotopes.\nThe basic properties of fragmentation reactions, such as\nthe production cross sections and\/or momentum distributions\nof the reaction products, knowledge of which is crucial for\nthe design and optimal operation of a fragment separator, are\nrather well known @14\u201316#.

Details are given in the text.mation on the population of states as a function of angular\nmomentum in fragmentation reactions is far from complete.\nRecently, probabilities for the production of a number of\nmicrosecond isomers produced in the quasifragmentation re-\nactions of 112Sn, 92Mo, and 86Kr beams at energy of about\n60 MeV\/nucleon have been published @5,8,17,18#. However,\nfor projectile energies above 100 MeV\/nucleon, much less\ninformation is known. For this \u2018\u2018relativistic\u2019\u2019 energy domain,\nprior to the current work, the only reported results to our\nknowledge are the population probabilities for the 43Sc iso-\nmer produced by the fragmentation of a 46Ti beam @10# and\nfor a few microsecond isomers identified among the frag-\nmentation products of a 238U beam at 1 GeV\/nucleon @11#.\nMotivated by the lack of data on the one hand and by the\nprospects of forming and utilizing beams of exotic nuclei in\nmetastable states @19# on the other, we have performed a\nstudy of the population of microsecond isomers following\nthe projectile fragmentation of a 208Pb beam at 1 GeV\/\nnucleon at the SIS\/FRS facility at GSI Darmstadt. A number\nof new isomers have been identified in this experiment and\nsome interesting cases have already been published else-\nwhere @13,20\u201327#. In the present paper we report on results\nobtained for approximately 20 previously reported isomers\nwhich cover a broad range in atomic mass, excitation energy,\nand angular momentum. In the next section a detailed de-\nscription of the experimental method and identification pro-\ncedure is given. The following section deals with the analysis\nof the data and presents the results. In Sec. IV a simple\nmodel of isomeric population, based on the abrasion-ablation\ntheory of the fragmentation process, is introduced. A com-\nparison of the measured values with model predictions is\ndiscussed in Sec. V.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE\nA. Setup\nThe nuclei of interest were produced following the frag-\nmentation of a 1 GeV\/nucleon 208Pb primary beam, deliv-\nered by the SIS synchrotron, onto a 1.6 g\/cm2 beryllium\nproduction target, which was located at the entrance of the\nGSI projectile fragment separator FRS @28#. The average pri-\nmary beam intensity, as measured by a secondary electron\nmonitor, varied between 13106 ions per spill when frag-\nments close to stability were selected and 23108 ions per\nspill at settings on nuclei very far from the line of stability.\nThe typical length and repetition period of a spill were 4 and\n10 s, respectively.\nThe FRS was operated in the standard achromatic mode\nwith an aluminum wedge-shaped degrader at the intermedi-\nate focal plane ~see Fig. 1!. The thickness of the degrader at06460the optical axis was set to 4.4 g\/cm2 and was kept constant\nthroughout the experiment.\nIn order to maximize the electron stripping, niobium foils\nof thickness 221 mg\/cm2 and 108 mg\/cm2 were mounted\ndownstream from the target and the degrader, respectively.\nThe probability of an ion being fully stripped of electrons in\nboth sections of the FRS was calculated with the code GLO-\nBAL @29#. It was found that the corresponding values were\ntypically about 96% and 88%. Predictions of the GLOBAL\ncode were tested by measuring the intensities of the fully\nstripped, H-like and He-like charge states of the primary\nbeam, and an excellent agreement between calculated and\nmeasured values was found.\nIn-flight identification of ions in the second stage of the\nFRS was achieved by a standard detector setup, as shown\nschematically in Fig. 1. At the intermediate focal plane, up-\nstream from the degrader, a 5-mm-thick plastic scintillator\n~SC1! was mounted. This served for both time-of-flight\n~TOF! and position measurements. The latter, measured in\nthe horizontal ~dispersive! direction, was determined from\nthe time difference between signals read from the left and\nright ends of the SC1 scintillator. The particle identification\ndetectors at the final focus consisted of ~i! two multiwire\nproportional chambers ~MW1, MW2!, yielding horizontal\nand vertical positions, ~ii! a fourfold ionization chamber\n~MUSIC! providing energy-loss information DE , and ~iii! a\nplastic scintillator ~SC2! of 5 mm thickness which delivered\nthe second TOF signal and the trigger for the acquisition\nsystem.\nAfter passing the identification setup, the ions were\nslowed down in an aluminum degrader of thickness between\n4.4 g\/cm2 and 5 g\/cm2 ~depending on the FRS setting!, and\nwere finally implanted into a 4-mm-thick aluminum catcher.\nTwo additional plastic scintillators ~SC3, SC4! were mounted\non either side of the catcher and used to verify that all se-\nlected ions were stopped in the catcher. The energy-loss sig-\nnal from the SC3 detector was also used for off-line suppres-\nsion of events resulting from charge-changing nuclear\ninteractions of ions during the slowing down process. The\ncatcher plate was of dimensions 20 cm wide and 10 cm high\nand was thus large enough to stop all the heavy fragments\ntransmitted simultaneously at any one FRS setting. The\ncatcher was surrounded by three segmented clover germa-\nnium detectors from the EXOGAM Collaboration @30# and a\nlarge-volume GSI \u2018\u2018Super Clover,\u2019\u2019 mounted as close as pos-\nsible to the catcher, but without blocking the heavy-ion tra-\njectories. Each detector consisted of four separate germa-\nnium crystals. Out of these 16 available individual gamma\nchannels, only 14 were included in the off-line analysis pre-\nsented in the current study ~two channels were rejected be-4-2\nANGULAR MOMENTUM POPULATION IN THE . . .

This al-\nlowed an absolute calibration of the TOF and energy loss\n(DE), as well as the horizontal positions at the intermediate\nand final focuses (x1 and x2, respectively!.\nB. Identification of heavy ions\nFrom the ion-optical properties of the achromatic mode of\nthe FRS, it follows that the magnetic rigidity Br2 of each\nparticle in the second stage of the FRS can be calculated\nfrom the expression\nBr25Br0S 12 x22V2x1D2 D , ~1!\nwhere Br0 is the magnetic rigidity of particles at the optical\naxis, given by the magnetic fields of the dipole magnets and06460their radii. The magnification V2 and dispersion D2 of the\nsecond stage were 1.094 and 6969 mm, respectively.\nThe mass-to-charge ratio A\/q is then given by\nA\/q5\ne\nu c\nBr2\nb g\n, ~2!\nwhere e is the elementary charge, u is the atomic mass unit,\nb is the ratio of the velocity of an ion, determined from the\nTOF, to the speed of light c, and g is the Lorentz factor (g\n51\/A12b2).\nThe steps in the heavy-ion identification procedure are\nillustrated in the four parts of Fig. 2, which show data col-\nlected while the FRS was tuned for the optimal transmission\nof 177Ta.\nInitially, the position x1 is plotted against A\/q @Fig. 2~a!#\nallowing a selection in terms of the charge-state difference\nbetween the first and second FRS sections. The group of\nevents marked by a polygon represents ions whose charge\nstate remained unchanged while passing through the de-\ngrader and detector materials at the intermediate focus.4-3\nM. PFU\u00a8 TZNER et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 65 064604These events predominantly correspond to fully stripped ions\ncontaminated by some H-like ions. The contribution from\nHe-like ions is negligible. The neighboring group of events\nrepresents ions which picked up an electron at the interme-\ndiate focus. Here, the main contribution comes from fully\nstripped ions emerging from the target stripper which change\nto the H-like state in the second stage.\nFor events selected by the condition in Fig. 2~a!, the po-\nsition x2 versus A\/q is plotted @see Fig. 2~b!#, which high-\nlights the good separation by both element and isotope. A\ncomparison with the ion-optical Monte Carlo simulation\nMOCADI @31# can be used to determine the identity of the\nselected nuclides. ~As will be discussed later in more detail,\nthis identification is fully confirmed by the observation of the\ngamma rays depopulating known isomers present in the se-\nlection.! From the MOCADI simulation it follows that for each\nion with mass A and atomic number Z, identified in Fig. 2~b!,\nthere is a small contamination from a nuclear species with\nA25 and Z21 which is transmitted through the FRS as a\nH-like ion. Although the production cross section for such a\ncontaminant is larger by approximately a factor of 2 than for\na nucleus of interest in this region @32#, the probability for a\nH-like charge state is less than 0.5%, resulting in a contami-\nnation level of less than 1%.\nFurther purification of the selected events was achieved\nby means of signals from the ionization chamber. The atomic\nnumber Z of a particle can be estimated by assuming that\nDE5Z2 f ~b!. ~3!\nThe function f, which depends only on the ion velocity and\nnot on Z, was deduced from the primary beam calibration\nmeasurements. The spectrum of Z determined for selected\n177Ta events as shown in Figs. 2~a! and 2~b! is plotted in Fig.\n2~c!. The corresponding spectrum of 174Hf events is also\nshown for comparison. It can be seen that the resolution of\nthe MUSIC detector is not quite good enough for a com-\npletely clean separation of neighboring elements, mainly due\nto a low-energy tail caused by charge exchange processes in\nthe counter gas. The small shift, resulting in the absolute\nvalues of Z appearing not to be calculated exactly, is partially\ndue to a slow drift of the signal amplitude induced by\nchanges in the atmospheric pressure. Nevertheless, by im-\nposing a condition on the MUSIC detector signal, as shown\nin Fig 2~c!, one can strongly suppress any remaining contri-\nbutions from nuclei with different Z from the specific nuclear\nspecies of interest.\nThe identified ions could still be destroyed due to interac-\ntions in the final degrader. The energy-loss signals measured\nby the SC3 scintillator were used to suppress such events.\nThe resulting spectrum for selected 177Ta ions is shown in\nFig. 2~d!. Events inside the main peak, which represent about\n70% of all counts in the spectrum, are interpreted as those\nwhich survived the deceleration process. However, this num-\nber should be corrected for neutron knock-out channels\n(xn-reaction channels!, since removal of neutrons does not\ninfluence the energy-loss spectrum. The total cross section\nfor the removal of neutrons from the secondary beams in\naluminum was estimated by using the abrasion-ablation code06460ABRABLA @33#. For the case of 177Ta, a value of 450 mb was\nfound. This number yields a correction of about 5% to the\nfinal number of stopped ions. Further losses, due to second-\nary reactions in the SC3 scintillator and in the catcher, were\nestimated using the total nuclear interaction cross section\nformula of Benesh, Cook, and Vary @34#. These losses\namounted, on average, to approximately 9%. Finally, com-\nbining all factors together, we find that only about 60% of\nions identified in front of the final degrader survive the slow-\ning down and are stopped in the catcher.\nC. Isomer spectroscopy\nThe ions arriving at the final focus are distributed ran-\ndomly in time during the spill, and since their total rate was\nalways below 1 kHz, the average time between consecutive\nions was larger than 1 ms. The electronic logical gate for\ngamma detection was only opened for a period of 80 ms\nafter the arrival of a heavy ion, and all subsequent signals\nfrom particle and gamma detectors which were read in this\ntime period were stored as a single \u2018\u2018event.\u2019\u2019 For each detec-\ntor, the time between the implantation and an associated de-\ntected g ray ~either prompt or delayed! was recorded over\ntwo time ranges: 0 \u20138 ms @time-to-digital converter ~TDC!#\nand 0 \u201380 ms @time-to-amplitude converter ~TAC!#. This\ntechnique allowed the association of isomeric gamma rays\nwith the identified ion, while both room background and ra-\ndiation from other nuclei are strongly suppressed @5#.\nThe method is sensitive to isomers with half-lives in the\nrange from about 100 ns up to several milliseconds. The\nlower limit is determined by the time of flight through the\nFRS ~typically approximately 300 ns!.

Therefore, efficiency\ncurves for each crystal were measured by placing a calibra-\ntion source at five different positions on both the front and\nback sides of the catcher, along the central horizontal line.\nThe resulting values from both the front and back were av-\neraged and a parabolic interpolation was applied to deter-\nmine the efficiency curves e i(x2) for each crystal (i\n51, . . . ,14) and for any position x2 of the radiation source.\nThe stopping of heavy ions in the catcher was accompa-\nnied by a prompt burst of radiation, mainly due to x rays and\nbremsstrahlung. Since the gate for gamma detection allowed4-4\nANGULAR MOMENTUM POPULATION IN THE . . .

DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS\nThe isomeric ratio R is defined as the probability that in\nthe reaction a nucleus is produced in an isomeric state. We\ndetermine it in the following way. First, the observed decay\nyield is calculated:\nY5\nNg~11a tot!\nee f fbg\n, ~4!\nwhere Ng is the number of counts in the gamma line depopu-\nlating the isomer of interest, a tot is the total conversion co-\nefficient for this transition, ee f f is the effective efficiency,\nand bg is the probability that the decay proceeds through this\ntransition ~i.e., the absolute branching ratio!.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 65 064604where Nimp is the number of implanted heavy ions, F is a\ncorrection factor for the in-flight isomer decay losses, and the\nfactor G corrects for the finite detection time of gamma ra-\ndiation. The factor F is calculated from\nF5expF2S lq1 TOF1g1 1lq2 TOF2g2 D G , ~6!\nwhere TOF1 (TOF2) is the time of flight through the first\n~second! stage of the FRS, g1 (g2) is the corresponding Lor-\nentz factor, and lq1 (lq2) is the decay constant for the ion in\nthe charge state q1 (q2). Since only TOF2 was measured in\nthe experiment, TOF1 and g1 were calculated using the ion-\noptical code MOCADI @31#. In this experiment, the transported\nions were highly charged ~in most of our cases the ions were\nfully stripped!, and the decay constants lq can differ consid-\nerably from the value for an electrically neutral atom, l . For\nthe fully stripped ion, l0 can be calculated from\nl05l(\ni\nbgi\n11a tot\ni , ~7!\nwhere the summation is over all the decay branches depopu-\nlating the isomer.\nFinally, the correction factor G is calculated using\nG5exp~2l t i!2exp~2l t f !, ~8!\nwhere t i and t f are the gamma delay-time limits set in the\noff-line analysis to produce the delayed gamma spectrum.\nWhen more than one gamma-ray line was observed to\ndepopulate an isomer, the isomeric ratio was calculated sepa-\nrately for the strongest lines and then averaged.\nIn some cases, more than one isomer in the same nucleus\nis populated in the reaction and a lower-lying isomer may be\npartly fed by the delayed decay of a higher-lying metastable\nstate. We adopt here the definition of isomeric ratio as the\nprobability that a state is populated promptly after produc-\ntion of the nucleus in the reaction. Then, it can be shown ~see\nthe Appendix! that in a case where the upper state decays\nwith the probability ~branching! bUL to the lower one, the\nisomeric ratio for the latter can be calculated by\nRL5\nY L\nNimpFLGL\n2bUL\nRU\nFLGL FlLGU2lUGLlL2lU FU\n1\nlU\n0\nlL\n02lU\n0 GL~FU2FL!G , ~9!\nwhere the indices L and U refer to the lower and upper states,\nrespectively, and the second term on the right side represents\nthe correction due to feeding from the upper state.\nIn the course of the experiment a number of different FRS\nsettings were applied to study nuclei in three different areas\non the Segre\u00b4 chart. The current work concentrates on results\nfrom settings centered on ~i! the proton drip line in the vi-\ncinity of 138Gd, ~ii! close to stability around ~a! 177Ta and ~b!\n180Ta, and ~iii! around the most neutron-rich tungsten isotope06460identified to date, 191W. Accurate determination of the iso-\nmeric ratios, as follows from the above formulas, requires\ndetailed knowledge of the appropriate decay schemes. There-\nfore, in the present paper we only report on well-known iso-\nmers. Altogether more than 20 such isomers were observed\nin 18 nuclei. The number of implanted ions ranged from\nabout 23104 in the case of 176Hf to about 73106 in the case\nof 181Re. The measured gamma spectra of some isomers\n(136Sm, 138Gd, 179W, 200Pt, and 206Hg) were already pub-\nlished elsewhere ~Refs. @13,20\u201327#!. The gamma spectra ob-\ntained for all other cases, together with the decay curves for\nselected gamma lines, fitted using the least squares method,\nare presented in Figs. 5, 6, and 7.\nThe properties of isomeric states and the results of the\nisomeric ratio analysis are given in Table I. The lifetimes of\ndetected isomers were analyzed and in the single-isomer\ncases were found to be consistent with the published values,\nbut in general with larger error bars. In the current work the\npublished values from references quoted in Table I were used\nfor all cases.\nThe quoted uncertainties represent the statistical errors\nadded in quadrature to a systematic error of 15%, which\narises mainly from the efficiency determination procedure. A\ncross-check of this procedure was provided by the 61 isomer\nin 176Hf @38# and by the 142 isomer in 180W @45# which\nwere observed at two different FRS settings: namely, those\ncentered on 177Ta and 180Ta. Although in these two cases the\n176Hf and 180W ions were stopped at different positions and,\nconsequently, the effective gamma efficiencies were differ-\nent, the same values were obtained for the isomeric ratios.\nAll of the isomers listed in Table I were transmitted\nthrough the FRS as fully stripped ions, with the exceptions of\n200Pt and 206Hg. These were transmitted as hydrogen- and\nhelium-like ions, respectively, in the second stage of the\nFRS, when the spectrometer was tuned for fully stripped\n191W ions. Also the final degrader was adjusted to achieve\nthe proper implantation of nuclei in the vicinity of 191W.\nThese conditions were not optimal for implantation of much\nheavier systems like 206Hg. Indeed, the MOCADI simulations\nshowed that 206Hg ions had the shortest range and some of\nthem might have been stopped before reaching the catcher.\nThe very short implantation depth of 206Hg was confirmed\nby the Pi\nburst values which were the smallest for this isotope.\nHence, our value for the isomeric ratio in this case might be\nunderestimated and should be considered as a lower limit.\nThe case of 200Pt, which was the most strongly populated\nisomer in our experiment, is special @23\u201325,27#. Despite its\nvery short half-life of 14.3 ns @49# it survives the much\nlonger flight time of approximately 300 ns, because, when\nfully stripped, the effective ionic half-life increases to at least\n1 ms due to the blocking of the electron conversion decay\nbranch. The lifetime remains long even when the ion is trans-\nmitted in a H-like state, because the energy of the isomeric\ntransition is lower than the K-electron binding energy in\nplatinum ~78 keV!.\nIn the four nuclides 174Hf, 175Hf, 179W, and 181W, the\ndecays of two isomers were observed. In the first two cases\nthe decay of the upper state feeds the lower-lying one and4-6\nANGULAR MOMENTUM POPULATION IN THE . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 65 064604FIG. 5.

The\ntransitions marked with their energy in keV were used to determine the isomeric ratios. The insets show the measured decay of the marked\ntransitions together with the fitted decay curves and the deduced half-lives. In the case of 174Hf, the 207 keV line, depopulating the\nlower-lying, short-lived 61 isomer, is observed to decay with the half-life consistent with the value known for the upper 82 isomer as the\nresult of feeding the 61 state in the decay of the 82 one.064604-7\nM. PFU\u00a8 TZNER et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 65 064604FIG. 6. Singles gamma-ray spectra corresponding to the indicated heavy ions as in Fig. 5.Eq. ~9! had to be used to extract isomeric ratios. For the\nlower 61 state in 174Hf @37#, this procedure was rather inac-\ncurate and only an upper limit could be deduced.\nIn the cases of 177Ta and 181Re the decays of three iso-\nmers were detected. For the 9\/22 state in 177Ta @41#, the\ncorrection due to feeding from the 21\/22 isomer again\nyielded an upper limit. The third isomer in this nucleus,\nwhich has spin\/parity 5\/22, is not fed by the decays of the\nother two and it does not have to be corrected. In 181Re the\n25\/21 state is fed by the decay of the 35\/22 isomer @47#, but\nsince the latter is very weakly populated in the reaction, the\nresulting correction was found to be very small. Thus, the\napplication of the two-level model @Eq. ~9!# to the feeding of\nthe 21\/22 isomer by the decay of the 25\/21 state was justi-\nfied. Again, only an upper limit can be given.\nIV. SHARP CUTOFF MODEL\nTo describe the population of an isomeric state in a frag-\nmentation reaction we separate the process into two steps. In\nthe ablation phase of the reaction, highly excited prefrag-\nments evaporate nucleons until the final fragment is formed06460with an excitation energy below the particle emission thresh-\nold. Subsequently, a statistical gamma cascade proceeds\ndown to the yrast line and then along this line to the ground\nstate. If a long-lived state lies on this decay path, part of the\ncascade may be hindered or stopped depending on the life-\ntime of the isomer. The isomeric ratio is equal to the prob-\nability that gamma decay from the initial excited fragments\nproceeds via this isomeric state.\nThe crucial aspect of the first step is the distribution of the\nangular momentum in the ensemble of the excited fragments\njust prior to the gamma deexcitation step. This problem was\naddressed by de Jong, Ignatyuk, and Schmidt @51# who ap-\nplied the statistical abrasion-ablation model @33# of fragmen-\ntation. Assuming that any angular momentum taken away by\nevaporating particles is small and can be neglected, they cal-\nculated the angular momentum distribution of the final frag-\nment as the superposition of the angular momenta of all pre-\nfragments contributing to the final fragment of interest using\nthe ABRABLA code @33#. Furthermore, they have shown that\nfor a large mass difference between the projectile and the\nfragment this distribution can be approximated by a simple\nanalytical formula4-8\nANGULAR MOMENTUM POPULATION IN THE . . .

The third isomer in\n181Re\u2014the short-lived 21\/22 state\u2014is fed by the decay of the higher-lying, long-lived 25\/21 isomer.

First, we\nassume that the initial excitation energies are well above the\nexcitation energy of the isomer. All the observed isomers\ndescribed in the current work lie below 4 MeV in excitation\nenergy ~see Table I!, while the particle emission threshold for\nthese nuclei is of the order of 8 MeV. Second, we make the\nextreme simplifying assumption that all states with J>Jm ,\nand only those, decay to the isomer. A similar approach,\nknown in the literature as the \u2018\u2018sharp cutoff model,\u2019\u2019 has been\nused in studies of angular momentum distributions in com-\npound nuclei @54\u201356# and in fission fragments @57#.

DISCUSSION\nThe inspection of the last two columns of Table I reveals\nthat only in seven cases is the agreement between the sharp\ncutoff model and experiment satisfactory. In all other cases\nthe model overestimates the isomeric ratios.\nFirst, we note the exceptional character of 5\/22 isomers in-10\nANGULAR MOMENTUM POPULATION IN THE . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 65 064604177Ta and in 181W. In these cases, the spin of the isomer is\nlower than the spin of the ground state. These isomers are\nvery weakly populated presumably because they are not situ-\nated on the main flow of the gamma cascade which proceeds\nalong the yrast line and stops, most likely, at the ground\nstate. Such a scenario is not within the scope of the sharp\ncutoff model, whose prediction of large isomeric ratios in\nthese cases (.90%) simply reflects the low value of the\nspin.\nNext, it should be pointed out that in those cases where\nmore than one isomer was observed, the isomeric ratios ob-\ntained experimentally for the lower-lying states generally\ncannot be compared with the model because its assumption\nthat all states with the higher spin decay promptly to the\nisomer of interest is explicitly violated. In principle, in those\ncases where the higher-lying isomer decays to the lower\nstate, like in 174Hf, 175Hf, 177Ta, and 181Re, one could add\nthe two ~or three! measured isomeric ratios to compare with\nthe prediction for the lowest state. Although this procedure\nreduces the observed discrepancies between the model and\nthe experiment in these cases, it does not help to understand\nFIG. 8. Angular momentum distributions in the final products of\nthe fragmentation of 1 GeV\/nucleon 208Pb beam on a beryllium\ntarget calculated with the ABRABLA code @33# ~solid line histogram!\ncompared with the predictions of the analytical approximation de-\nscribed in the text ~dashed curve!. All distributions are normalized\nto the integral value of 1.064604them because already the higher-lying state is not properly\ndescribed by the model. Moreover, in the cases where two\nisomers are not connected by the decay path, like in 179W,\nsuch procedure is not justified. Therefore, we concentrate in\nthe following discussion only on the highest-lying identified\nstates.\nWe also exclude the case of 206Hg. The model based on\nthe full ABRABLA calculation overestimates the isomeric ratio\nfor the 52 ~yrast! state in this nucleus @50# by almost an\norder of magnitude. This could be the effect of the incorrect\nimplantation of this nucleus resulting in the underestimated\nvalue of the measured isomeric ratio, as discussed in Sec. III.\nThe prediction of the sharp cutoff model depends on the\nspin of the isomer, on the mass difference between the pro-\njectile and the final fragment, and on the deformation param-\neter b . Plots of selected isomeric ratios versus mass differ-\nence (DA), for the constant value of spin J, are shown in\nFig. 9 for the three cases of J58, J521\/2, and J535\/2\ntogether with model predictions. In each group of given J all\npoints are associated with a similar value of deformation\nparameter b and hence a constant b value was adopted in\ncalculating the predictions for each spin.\nIt turns out that in each case the experimental points are\nlocated close to or below the theoretical lines. We observe\nthat the three data points for J58, which differ from the\nFIG. 9. Measured isomeric ratios as a function of mass differ-\nence DA between the projectile and the fragment for three values of\nisomeric spin compared with predictions of the sharp cutoff model.\nThe solid points indicate isomers located on the yrast line or very\nclose to it. The deformation parameter b was assumed to be 0.23,\n0.23, and 0.24 for J58, 21\/2, and 35\/2, respectively.-11\nM. PFU\u00a8 TZNER et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 65 064604predicted value by a factor of about 20, represent isomers\nlying more than 450 keV above the yrast line. In the case of\nthe J535\/2 isomer in 181Re @47# ~which is nonyrast by 521\nkeV!, the experimental isomeric ratio is, again, smaller than\nthe model prediction by a factor of 10 while the two other\nresults which are yrast or very close to yrast (179W @44# and\n175Hf @37#! agree well with the model. Note that these three\nisomers represent the highest discrete spin observed to date\nin fragmentation reactions. In contrast, this tendency is not\nsupported by J521\/2 isomers. For the only yrast case\u2014\nnamely, 179Ta @42#\u2014the measured isomeric ratio is nearly 3\ntimes smaller than the prediction, while the two points which\nare in a good agreement with the model, corresponding to\n185Re @48# and 181W @45#, are nonyrast by 261 keV and 614\nkeV, respectively. The reduction of the isomeric ratio in the\ncase of 179Ta could be explained by the existence of a long-\nlived isomer (T1\/2511 ms, Jp525\/21) located just above\n~65 keV! the 21\/22 state @42#. If a substantial part of the\ngamma cascade is trapped in this long-lived state, the feed-\ning of the observed 21\/2 isomer will be negligible in the\nrelatively short observation time. In this nucleus, however,\nthere is another isomer which should be populated and ob-\nserved as well (23\/22, T1\/251.6 ms, yrast!, located about\n75 keV above the 21\/22 state and decaying to it @42#. Sur-\nprisingly, we see neither the 75 keV transition depopulating\nthe 23\/22 isomer nor its influence on the decay pattern of the\n232 keV and 475 keV lines depopulating the 21\/22 state ~see\nFig. 5!.\nIn the following, we will concentrate our discussion on\nhow isomeric ratios are influenced by the energy difference\nbetween the isomeric state and the yrast line. In individual\ncases, however, nuclear structure effects such as the trapping\nof the gamma cascade by specific higher-lying isomeric\nstates which are too long-lived to be detected in the present\nexperiment or details of the decay branching pattern close to\nFIG. 10. Ratios of the measured isomeric ratio to the value\npredicted by the sharp cutoff model plotted vs the energy difference\nbetween the isomer and the yrast line. In nuclei where two isomers\nwere measured, only the higher-lying state is included. Open points\nindicate cases where higher-lying, long-lived isomers are known,\nbut could not be identified in the present measurement because of\ntoo short observation time ~TAC range!.064604the yrast line, may of course also strongly affect the isomeric\nratio.\nFigure 10 shows the ratio Rexpt \/Rth versus the excitation\nenergy of the isomer above the yrast state of the same spin in\nthat particular nucleus. Open symbols indicate those cases\nwhere a higher-lying, long-lived isomer ~not observed in our\nexperiment! is known to exist, which may reduce the feeding\nof the isomers we observe by delaying part of the gamma\ncascade. With the exception of 179Ta, which was discussed\nabove, these cases include 176Ta, where an Ip5202, T1\/2\n51 ms isomer has been reported @40# above the 142 state\nobserved in the current work, and 176Hf, where both Ip\n5142, T1\/25400 ms and Ip582, T1\/259.8 ms isomers\nare located @38# above the measured 61 state. Indeed, iso-\nmeric ratios in these cases appear to be reduced with respect\nto the model. Despite these complications, it is evident that\nthe overall trend is one of decreasing isomeric ratio with\nincreasing energy above the yrast line.\nThe data points in Fig. 10 are grouped in two rather sepa-\nrate regions. In the first group, which represents results close\nto the model prediction, a decrease of the Rexpt \/Rth ratio\nwith increasing energy from the yrast line is observed. The\nisomeric ratio is reduced by a factor of about 2 at 700 keV\nabove the yrast line. The second group represents isomers far\nfrom the yrast line, which correspond to the smallest ob-\nserved values of Rexpt ~less than 10% of the model predic-\ntion!. The strong reduction in the isomeric ratio for 174Hf\nwhich belongs to this group ~open point! may be explained\nby two independent factors: ~a! the fact that it lies a long way\nfrom the yrast line and ~b! the presence of the higher-lying,\nlong-lived isomer. One might suspect that for other nuclei in\nthis group, long-lived isomeric states, as yet unobserved, are\npresent.\nFinally, the sharp cutoff model is observed to represent\nthe upper limit for the isomeric ratio. Its key assumption\nconcerning the flow of the gamma cascade following the\nformation of the fragment is very crude and is particularly\nlimiting in case of nuclei with such a rich structure of iso-\nmers like the region of K isomers investigated in this work.\nGenerally, the predictions of the model are more accurate for\nthe yrast states\u2014out of seven cases in which good agreement\nbetween the model and the experiment is found, five are\nyrast states. However, exceptions from this rule are observed.\nThe 142 state in 180W and 21\/21 in 181W are both far from\nthe yrast line, yet their population probability agrees well\nwith the prediction. On the other hand, the 9\/22 isomer in\n177Ta, although yrast, is apparently omitted by the main flow\nof the gamma cascade and its population is found to be much\nweaker that for the higher-lying, nonyrast 21\/22 state. Evi-\ndently other nuclear structure effects influencing the detailed\nbranching scheme are responsible for such strong deviations\nfrom the model in the individual cases.\nVI. SUMMARY\nIn summary, we have measured the isomeric ratios for\nmore than 20 isomers, ranging in mass between A5136 and\n206, produced in the fragmentation of a 208Pb beam at 1\nGeV\/nucleon. These isomers show a wide distribution in an--12\nANGULAR MOMENTUM POPULATION IN THE . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 65 064604gular momenta, ranging from 52 \\ up to 352 \\ . The latter rep-\nresents the largest discrete spin observed to date in fragmen-\ntation reactions. A simple model of the isomer population is\ndescribed. It is based on the initial angular momentum dis-\ntribution in a projectile fragment, as given by the statistical\nabrasion-ablation model of the fragmentation, and on the as-\nsumption that all initial states with higher spin values than\nthe isomer subsequently decay to it. The predictions of this\nmodel are found to give an upper limit for the measured\nisomeric ratios. It is observed that the population probability\nfor an isomer is generally reduced if it is located far from the\nyrast line.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe excellent work of the SIS synchrotron staff providing\na high-intensity primary beam is acknowledged.

The upper state decays\nto the lower one with a probability ~absolute branching!\nbUL . Assume that out of N0 such nuclei produced at time t\n50, RU N0 are found in the upper state and RL N0 in the\nlower one, where RU and RL denote the corresponding iso-\nmeric ratios. The time dependence of the number of upper\nand lower isomers @NU\nm(t) and NLm(t)# is given by the fol-\nlowing differential equations:\ndNU\nm~ t !\ndt 52lU\nq NU\nm~ t !, ~A1!\ndNL\nm~ t !\ndt 52lL\nqNL\nm~ t !1bULlU\nq NU\nm~ t !, ~A2!\nwith the initial conditions NU\nm(0)5RUN0 and NLm(0)\n5RLN0. The decay constant lq depends on the charge state\nof an ion and thus it is different for an ion in flight ~stripped!\nand for an ion at rest ~neutral!. For the sake of simplicity we\nassume in the following that lq5l0 for 0,t<TOF and\nlq5l for t.TOF; i.e., an ion is fully stripped during the\nTOF and neutral after stopping.\nThe solution of Eq. ~A1! reads064604NU\nm~ t !5H R1N0e2lU0 t for 0,t<TOF,\nR1N0e2lU\n0 TOFe2lU(t2TOF) for t>TOF.\n~A3!\nThe number of decays of the upper isomer ~the yield! within\nthe observation time limits TOF1t i,t,TOF1t f , at the\nend of the separator, is given by\nY U5TE\nTOF1t i\nTOF1t f\nlUNU\nm~ t !dt5RUNimpFUGU , ~A4!\nwhere T is the total transmission of ions through the separa-\ntor, Nimp5TN0 is the number of ions implanted in the stop-\nper and correction factors FU5e2lU\n0 TOF and GU5e2lUti\n2e2lUt f were introduced for the in-flight decay losses and\nfor the finite detection time, respectively. The necessary\nmodification of the factor F due to relativistic time dilation\nand varying velocity in the spectrometer are straightforward\n@see Eq. ~6!#.\nNow, Eq. ~A2! is solved after substituting for NU\nm(t) the\nsolutions ~A3! and ~A4!. For 0,t<TOF one gets\nNL\nm~ t !5RLN0e2lL\n0 t1RUN0bUL\nlU\n0\nlL\n02lU\n0 ~e\n2lU\n0 t2e2lL\n0 t!,\n~A5!\nwhich for t5TOF reduces to\nNL\nm~TOF!5RLN0FL1RUN0bUL\nlU\n0\nlL\n02lU\n0 ~FU2FL!.\n~A6!\nThe solution for t>TOF reads\nNL\nm~ t !5RLN0FLe2lL(t2TOF)1RUN0bULH lU0\nlL\n02lU\n0\n3~FU2FL!e2lL(t2TOF)2\nlU\nlL2lU\n3FU@e2lL(t2TOF)2e2lU(t2TOF)#J . ~A7!\nThe yield of the lower isomer is then calculated:\nY L5TE\nTOF1t i\nTOF1t f\nlLNL\nm~ t !dt5RLNimpFLGL\n1RUNimpbULFlLGU2lUGLlL2lU FU\n1\nlU\n0\nlL\n02lU\n0 GL~FU2FL!G , ~A8!\nfrom which Eq. ~9! follows directly.-13\nM.
