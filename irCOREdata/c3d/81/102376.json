The channel for\neach subband is modeled by combing the linear and Fourier basis-expan-\nsion functions. Based on this mode, a two-dimensional interpolation ap-\nproach is proposed for the channel estimation, which is carefully investi-\ngated in terms of estimation error and pilot placement.\nIndex Terms\u2014Channel estimation, Doppler shifts, interpolation, orthog-\nonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA), time varying, uplink.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nOrthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA) is being\nconsidered to be the multiple access scheme for the uplink of future\nwireless systems, e.g., WiMax or 4G in Europe. One of typical struc-\ntures is the subband OFDMA, which divides all available subcarriers\ninto a number of subbands. Each user is allowed to use one available\nsubband for the data transmission. Pilot symbols are employed for the\nestimation of channel state information (CSI) within the subband. We\ncan see that the CSI here is the partial channel information of each\nuser channel. The channel estimation algorithms used for obtaining\nthe channel impulse response (CIR) (e.g., [1]\u2013[3]) may not be appli-\ncable in this scenario. Practically, placement of pilot symbols obeys\nthe criterion: channel fades between any two adjacent pilot symbols\n(either in time or frequency direction) can be regarded to be linear.\nThe polynomial-based interpolation (e.g., [4]) can be employed for\nthe channel estimation. However, the polynomial-based interpolation\nis sensitive to the pilot spacing. Its denoising capability is restricted\ndue to avoiding considerable modeling mismatch. It is noted by the\nreviewer that iterative approaches (e.g., [9] and [10]) have recently re-\nceived great interest in the channel estimation. In this paper, we only\nfocus on the model-based interpolation. The result may be used for the\ninitial channel estimate of the iterative approaches.\nGiannakis and Tepedelenlioglu mentioned in [5] that the time-fre-\nquency-selective channel can be modeled as Fourier basis expansion.\nThereafter, this model was intensively investigated and applied in block\ntransmission, channel estimation and equalization (e.g., [6]\u2013[8]). In an\nOFDM system, the channel fades on the n block of the mth subcarrier\nis given by (see [8])\n~h(n;m) =\nQ\nq=\u0000Q\nL\n`=0\n\rq(`) exp\n\u0000j2\u0019m`\nM\n=~\r (m)\nexp j\n2\u0019n \u0016fmaxq\nQ\n(1)\nwhere \rq(`) stands for the fading coefficient of the qth path in the `th\nchannel tap, \u0016fmax for the maximum Doppler shift normalized by the\nManuscript received November 11, 2005; revised February 27, 2006.

This\ntwo-dimensional model offers hybrid of linear and BEM interpola-\ntion (HLBI) for the channel estimation. The proposed approach is\ninvestigated both in single-transmit-antenna and multiple-transmit-\nantenna scenarios. The channel estimation performance, together with\npilot placement, is carefully studied. We compare the HLBI approach\nwith the time-frequency linear interpolation (TFLI) approach and\nfind that the former one shows better performance, particularly in the\nlow signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), larger Doppler, or multiple-transmit-\nantenna scenario.\nII. OFDMA UPLINK AND CHANNEL MODEL\nWe consider cyclic prefix (CP) OFDM to be the air interface, where\nCP is used to mitigate the interblock interference and introduce the cir-\nculant property (see [12] for detail). The multiuser channel is assumed\nto be invariant within one-block (or -symbol) duration. The symbol\ntiming mismatch is assumed to be smaller than the CP duration. In this\nscenario, users do not interfere each other in the frequency domain.\nWe assume that the desired subband consists of (K+1) subcarriers.\nThe channel fades within this subband can be formulated as\n~h(n;m) = a1(n)m+ a2(n); Ko m Ko +K (2)\nwhere a1 and a2 stand for TV coefficients, and Ko for the index of the\nstart subcarrier within the subband. Without loss of generality, we let\nKo = 0 and the received block index from 0 to N \u0000 1. Equations (1)\nand (2) lead to\na1(n)m+ a2(n) =\nQ\nq=\u0000Q\n~\rq(m) exp j\n2\u0019n \u0016fmaxq\nQ\n;\n0 n N \u0000 1; 0 m K: (3)\nWe construct a (K + 1) \u0002 N matrix ~H with the (k; n)th entry of\n[ ~H ]k;n = ~h(n; k), a (K + 1)\u0002 (2Q+ 1) matrix ~\u0000 with the (k; q)th\nentry of [~\u0000]k;q = ~\rq\u0000Q(k), a (2Q+1)\u0002N matrixU with the (q; n)th\nentry of [U ]q;n = Uq\u0000Q(n) for\nUq(n) = exp j\n2\u0019n \u0016fmaxq\nQ\n; \u0000Q q Q: (4)\nas well as the following two matrices:\nL =\n1; 1; . . . ; 1\n0; 1; . . . ; K\nT\nA =\na1(0); a1(1); . . . ; a1(N \u0000 1)\na2(0); a2(1); . . . ; a2(N \u0000 1)\n(5)\nwhere the superscript T stands for transpose. Then, (2) and (3) can be\nre-expressed as the following matrix forms, respectively:\n~H =LA (6)\nLA = ~\u0000U: (7)\nSince L has the full column rank, we can obtain\n~H = LLy~\u0000\n=\n\u0016A\nU (8)\nwhere the superscript y denotes pseudo inverse. Now, the problem be-\ncomes the estimation of the 2\u0002(2Q+ 1) matrix \u0016A.\n1It was pointed out in [5] that Q should be sufficiently large (e.g., Q = 4 or\n5) to simulate mobile communication channel.\n1053-587X\/$25.00 \u00a9 2007 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

CHANNEL ESTIMATION AND PILOT PLACEMENT\nA. Channel Estimation\nWe employ pilot symbols to identify \u0016A in the noisy scenario. To\nguarantee the channel identifiability, the number of pilot symbols\nshould not be smaller than 4Q+2. We use a (K +1)\u0002 1 vector p(n)\nto express the pilot information at the nth block within the desired\nsubband, i.e., the nonzero elements in p(n) denote pilot symbols in the\nfrequency domain, and the zero element means no pilot is placed here.\nLet ~h(n) and u(n) be the nth column vector of ~H andU , respectively.\nThe received pilot information can be expressed by\nr(n) =D(p(n))~h(n) + v(n) (9)\n=D(p(n))L \u0016Au(n) + v(n) (10)\nwhereD(a) denotes a diagonal matrix with the column vector a in its\ndiagonal, v(n) denotes additive white Gaussian noise with zero-mean\nand variance of \u001b2v . Our channel estimation algorithm is to minimize\nthe following function\n\u0018 =\nN\u00001\nn=0\nkr(n)\u0000D(p(n))L \u0016^Au(n)k2; (11)\nwhere k \u0001 k stands for Frobenius norm, and \u0016^A for the estimate of \u0016A. It\nis easy to see that \u0018 achieves its minimum when @\u0018=@ \u0016^A = 0, which is\nfollowed by\nN\u00001\nn=0\nLHD\u0003(p(n))r(n)uH(n) =\nN\u00001\nn=0\nLH D(p(n))D\u0003(p(n))\n=D(\u0016p(n))\n\u0002L \u0016^Au(n)uH(n) (12)\nwhere the superscript H stands for Hermitian. We assume that pilot\nsymbols have the identical amplitude denoted by \u001bp. The pilot place-\nment complies with the following criterion2:\n\u0016p(n) = \u0016p; n 2 N1; \u0016p(n) = 0; n 2 N2 (13)\nwhere N1 \\ N2 = 0 and N1 [ N2 = f0; 1; . . . ; N \u0000 1g. Then, (12)\ncan be rewritten into\nn2N\nLHD\u0003(p(n))r(n)uH(n) = LHD(\u0016p)L\n=\n\u0016L\n\u0016^A\nn2N\nu(n)uH(n)\n=U\n:\n(14)\nWe expect that the square matrices \u0016L and U have the full rank so that\n\u0016^A can be obtained via\n\u0016^A = \u0016L\n\u00001\nn2N\nLHD\u0003(p(n))r(n)uH(n)U\u00001: (15)\nThen, ~^H can be estimated by applying \u0016^A in (8).\nB. Pilot Placement and Performance Analysis\nThe first objective on pilot placement is to guarantee the channel\nidentifiability. Therefore, \u0016p should have at least two nonzero elements,\nand N1 should have at least 2Q + 1 elements. Then, we consider the\npilot placement by minimizing the mean-square channel estimation\nerror (MSCEE).\nWe plug (10) into (15) and obtain\n\u0016^A = \u0016A + \u0016L\n\u00001\nn2N\nLHD\u0003(p(n))v(n)uH(n)U\u00001\n=E\n: (16)\n2\u0016p(n) = \u0016p means that \u0016p(n) is identical for n 2 N :\nHere, E is the estimation error with zero mean. Then, the MSCEE is\ngiven by\nEkEk2 =Tr \u0016L\n\u00001\nLH\nn2N\nD\n\u0003(p(n))Efv(n)\u000b(n)vH(n)g\n\u0002D(p(n))L(\u0016L\n\u00001\n)H (17)\n=\u001b2v\nn2N\n\u000b(n)\u0010 (18)\nwhere E stands for expectation, Tr f\u0001g for trace, and\n\u000b(n) =uH(n)(UHU)\u00001u(n) (19)\n\u0010 =Tr \u0016L\n\u00001\n: (20)\nTherefore, minimizing MSCEE is equivalent to minimize\nn2N \u000b(n) as well as \u0010 .\n1) We re-express (4) as\nUq(n) = exp j\n2\u0019nN \u0016fmaxq\nNQ\n: (21)\nReference [6] suggested to choose N and Q properly so that\nN \u0016fmax\nQ\n\u0019\nN \u0016fmax\nQ\n= 1 (22)\nwhere d\u0001e stands for integer ceiling. Then,U becomes a submatrix\nof the N \u0002N inverse DFT matrix. In this case, it has been shown\nin [1] that\nn2N\n\u000b(n) achieves its minimum\nn2N\n\u000b(n)\nmin\n=\n2Q+ 1\nQ0\n(23)\nwhen N1 = f0; (N=Q0); . . . ; ((Q0 \u0000 1)N)=Q0g, where Q0 is\nthe number of element in N1 and fulfills N=Q0 to be an integer.\nWe also note that the computational complexity is major from the\nlinear and BEM interpolation. Based on (21) and (22), the BEM\ninterpolation can be implemented by employing fast Fourier trans-\nform. Therefore, the computational complexity is o(2Q0 logQ0+\n2N logN) for the BEM interpolation and o(2(K+1)N) for the\nlinear interpolation.\n2) \u0010 is the error from the linear interpolation. Practically, we use two\npilot symbols for linear regression. Denote x (K > x 0) and\nx+d(K d > 0) to be the pilot placement. We can easily obtain\n\u0010 =\n(x+ d)2 + x2 + 2\nd2\u001b2p\n: (24)\nThen, \u0010 achieves its minimum for x = 0 and d = K , i.e., \u0010min =\n(K2 + 2)= K2\u001b2p . Therefore, the minimum MSCEE is given\nby\n(EkEk2)min =\n\u001b2v(2Q+ 1)(K\n2 + 2)\n\u001b2pQ0K2\n: (25)\nThe estimation error considered here does not take into account\nof the modeling mismatch. It has been addressed in [11] that the\nBEM using rectangular window associated with the DFT intro-\nduces spectral leakage. The energy from low-frequency Fourier\ncoefficients leaks to the full frequency range. Slepian basis expan-\nsion is suggested to solve this problem. In this paper, however, we\nonly consider Fourier basis expansion.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on February 16,2010 at 12:12:36 EST from IEEE Xplore.

CONSIDERATION OF MULTIPLE TRANSMIT ANTENNAS\nWe consider a mobile terminal equipped with I transmit antennas.\nChannel estimation is individually carried out at each receiving an-\ntenna. The pilot placement and energy for different antennas are iden-\ntical. Therefore, the received pilot information is expressible as\nr(n) =\nI\u00001\ni=0\nD(pi(n))L\u0016Aiu(n) + v(n) (26)\nwhere the subscript i stands for transmit-antenna index. The\nleast-square channel estimation is to minimize the following function:\n\u0018 =\nN\u00001\nn=0\nkr(n)\u0000\nI\u00001\ni=0\nD(pi(n))L \u0016^Aiu(n)k\n2: (27)\nHence, the estimate \u0016^Aj for the jth transmit antenna must meet the con-\ndition @\u0018=@ \u0016^Aj = 0, which is followed by\nN\u00001\nn=0\nLH D(pj(n))D\n\u0003(pj(n))\n=D(\u0016p )\nL \u0016^Aju(n)u\nH(n)\n=\nN\u00001\nn=0\nLHD\u0003(pj(n))r(n)u\nH(n)\n\u0000LH\nN\u00001\nn=0\nI\u00001\ni=0;i6=j\nD\n\u0003(pj(n))D(pi(n))L \u0016^Ai u(n)u\nH(n):\n(28)\nThe second term at the right-hand side of (28) is the multiple-antenna\ninterference. It is expected to be zero so that the channel estimation\nfor multiple transmit antennas is equivalent to the case for the single\ntransmit antenna. Then, the following condition is sufficient:\nN\u00001\nn=0\nD\n\u0003(pj(n))D(pi(n))L \u0016^Aiu(n)u\nH(n) = 0; i 6= j: (29)\nWe expect to have a coefficient gij(n) that makes\nD\n\u0003(pj(n))D(pi(n)) = D(\u0016p)gij(n): (30)\nUsing the same pilot-placement scheme as in the single-transmit-an-\ntenna case, (29) can be rewritten into\nD(\u0016p)L \u0016^Ai\nn2N\ngij(n)u(n)u\nH(n) = 0; i 6= j: (31)\nBased on the principle of orthogonality, we can obtain\nn2N\ngij(n)u(n)u\nH(n) = 0 (32)\nby employing\ngij(n) = exp(j\n2\u0019n(2Q+ 1)\nN\n); n 2 N1: (33)\nUsing the above pilot design, the channel estimation for I transmit-\nantennas needs at least 2I(2Q + 1) pilot symbols. The MSCEE for\neach transmit antenna is the same as in the single-transmit-antenna case\n[see (25)].\nFig. 1. Example of a subband in the OFDMA uplink: (a) single transmit an-\ntenna and (b) two transmit antennas (Alamouti scheme).\nOn the other hand, the pilot pattern [(30), (33)] needs the knowledge\nofQ andN at the mobile terminal, which affects the receiver flexibility.\nAlternatively, we can use the following pilot pattern:\nD\n\u0003(pj(n))D(pi(n)) = 0: (34)\nZero pilot is employed here to avoid interantenna interference. This\npilot-pattern design has received applications in practical systems\n(e.g., WiMax). Fig. 1(b) shows an example of (34) with two transmit\nantennas (Alamouti scheme [13]). In this example, (29) should be\nrewritten into\nN\u00001\nn=0\nLH D(pj(n))D\n\u0003(pj(n))\n=D(\u0016p (n))\nL \u0016^Aju(n)u\nH(n)\n=\nN\u00001\nn=0\nLHD\u0003(pj(n))r(n)u\nH(n): (35)\nHere, \u0016pj(n) is given by\n\u0016pj(n) =\n\u0016pj;1; n 2 N1,\n\u0016pj;2; n 2 N2,\n0; n 2 N3,\n(36)\nwhere N1 \\N2 \\N3 = 0, N1 [N2 [N3 = f0; 1; . . . ; N \u0000 1g and\n\u0016pTj;1\u0016pj;2 = 0.

SIMULATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS\nWe evaluated the channel estimators using the normalized mean-\nsquare error (NMSE) denoted by\nNMSE = 1\nN(K + 1)I\nI\n{=1\nk ~^H { \u0000 ~Hk\n2\nk ~Hk2\n(42)\nwhere I is the number of Monte Carlo trials. The reason to use this\nNMSE definition is that we are not able to obtain the CIR in the subband\nOFDMA uplink. The estimated channel information ~^H was then used\nfor the channel equalization. The bit error rate (BER), averaged over\nI = 500 trials, was examined for both a single transmit antenna and\ntwo transmitantennas.3\nThe setup of OFDMA uplink was given by M = 128 subcarriers,\nwhich was divided into 32 subbands. Each subband consisted of four\nsubcarriers (i.e., K = 3). The information-bearing symbols were\ndrawn from the quadrature phase-shift-keying (QPSK) constellation\nwith the equal probability (uncoded source). The time-frequency\npilot\/data map is depicted in Fig. 1. Each frame (data burst) consists\nof 300 blocks. The mobile channel was generated according to the\n3GPP Vehicular A specified in [14]. The SNR was defined by the\naverage received symbol energy to noise. The normalized maximum\nDoppler-frequency \u0016fmax was considered to be 0.025 or 0.05, respec-\ntively, corresponding to the velocity of 75 km\/h or 150 km\/h in the\nsystem with 2-GHz central frequency and a block duration of 180 \u0016s.\nAs mentioned in [5], we focus on terrains entailing only a few reflec-\ntors so that the Doppler and multipath parameters can be considered to\nbe deterministic. In the simulations, we use the time-frequency linear\ninterpolation (TFLI) and the least-square (LS) approach (see [2]) for\nthe performance comparison. For the fair comparison, the transmitter\nsends one training sequence for every four blocks in the LS approach.\n1) Experiment 1 (Single Transmit Antenna): The pilot spacing (PS)\nalong the time direction was given by 2 and 4, respectively. The nor-\nmalized maximum Doppler frequency was assumed to be known at the\nreceiving end. For the case of \u0016fmax = 0:05, we set N = 80 and Q =\n4. The channel estimation performance was plotted in Fig. 2. It shows\nthat all curves generally decrease with increasing of the SNR. The LS\napproach shows the worst performance. The TFLI method has an error\nfloor for the case of SNR > 10 dB and PS = 4. This is because of the\nconsiderable mismatch between the linear channel model and the time\nselectivity between two adjacent pilots. The error floor vanishes when\nthe PS is reduced to 2.

Using the es-\ntimated channel information as well as the perfect channel knowledge\nfor the channel equalization, we plot the BER performance in Fig. 3. It\nis observed that the HLBI method outperforms both the TFLI and LS\nmethods. For the case of PS = 2, it offers very close performance to\nthat with the perfect channel knowledge. When the number of pilots is\nreduced to half (PS = 4), its performance is still comparable to that\nwith the perfect channel knowledge.\nFor the case of \u0016fmax = 0:025, we set N = 160 and Q = 4. Fig. 4\nillustrates the channel estimation performance. We can see that both\nthe LS and TFLI methods show the improved performance in compar-\nison to the case of \u0016fmax = 0:05. This is because of the reduction of\nmodelling mismatch in the relatively lower time-selectivity scenario.\nThe HLBI method shows the improved performance as well in com-\nparison to the case of \u0016fmax = 0:05. The major reason here is due to the\nincreased number of pilots in the channel estimation. The BER perfor-\nmance is then plotted in Fig. 5. We can observe that the HLBI method\nstill demonstrates the best performance. Under the same PS setup, the\ndifference between HLBI and TFLI is around 2 dB in SNR. Compared\nto the case with the perfect channel knowledge, the HLBI method of-\nfers close performance in the low- and medium-SNR range and only\nhas a 2-dB loss in the high-SNR range (> 20 dB).\n2) Experimental 2 (Two Transmit-Antennas): We use Alamouti\nscheme for data transmission. Then, the equalization can be easily\ncarried out at each receiving antenna. We note that the pilot pattern\n[(30), (33)] is not applicable in the TFLI method. For the fair com-\nparison, both HLBI and TFLI methods use the pilot pattern (34),\nwhich is depicted in Fig. 1(b). Fig. 6 illustrates the channel estimation\nperformance with \u0016fmax = 0:05.

CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have presented an HLBI-based channel estima-\ntion method for the subband OFDMA uplink. The proposed method\nwas based on the hybrid of linear and BEM channel model of the\npartial channel information. The channel estimation performance and\ntwo-dimensional pilot pattern have been analytically investigated in\nboth single and multiple transmit antennas. Simulation results were\nprovided to show the NMSE and BER performance. It has been shown\nthat the HLBI method has stronger denoising capability than the TFLI\nmethod. Its estimation performance would not been considerably af-\nfected by the Doppler frequency when the parameters for the HLBI\nmethod are set properly. Its overall system performance is comparable\nto the case with the perfect channel knowledge. The proposed method is\nparticularly suitable to the mobile environment where multipath prop-\nagation is caused by a few dominant reflectors.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank the associate editor Prof. P.

The weights for the target are the\nequivalent channel gain resulting from a zero-forcing (ZF)-based MIMO\nchannel diagonalization.

The signal-to-interference-plus-noise\nratio (SINR) is analyzed and the sum rates evaluated in a computer simu-\nlation.

INTRODUCTION\nSpatial multiplexing for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)\nradio systems, employing multiple transmit and receive antennas, has\nbeen recognized as an effective way to improve the spectral efficiency\nof wireless links [1]\u2013[3]. This is realized by transmitting multiple data\nsubstreams in parallel and performing some transmit\u2013receive pro-\ncessing which assists data recovery. In a multiuser MIMO downlink,\nwhere the base station communicates simultaneously with multiple\nusers, the data substreams are generated by combining the signals of\ndifferent users (Fig. 1). To mitigate the cochannel interference (CCI)\ncaused by the spatial multiplexing in a multiuser downlink, a channel\ninversion and its modifications [4]\u2013[7] have been introduced in the\nManuscript received May 11, 2005; revised June 23, 2006.

These are mainly useful for\nsystems with single-antenna receivers. For systems with multiple\nreceiver antennas, coordinated transmit\u2013receive processors have been\ndeveloped based on a joint-channel diagonalization1 [8]\u2013[11] and\na minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion [12]\u2013[17]. The\nchannel diagonalization methods are zero-forcing (ZF) algorithms\nthat attempt to eliminate the CCI, while ignoring noise. On the other\nhand, the MMSE algorithms control the degree of CCI suppression\ndepending on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Accordingly, the MMSE\nschemes outperform the channel diagonalization methods in low SNR\nenvironment [15].\nIn this paper, an alternative MMSE scheme is proposed that modi-\nfies the total-MMSE (T-MMSE) algorithm in [15]. It is observed that\nthe T-MMSE performs a regularized channel inversion and acts like\na channel inverter in high SNR environment. Consequently, the sum\nrate performance of the T-MMSE tends to become worse than that of\nthe channel diagonalization methods as the SNR increases. To avoid\nthis performance degradation, the MMSE criterion is modified so that\nthe resulting MMSE scheme performs regularized channel diagonaliza-\ntion. Specifically, the MMSE criterion employs a target vector which\nis given by a weighted information vector, where the weights are the\nequivalent channel gain resulting from a joint-channel diagonalization,\nand signal scaling. Due to the use of the weights, the proposed approach\ncan assign more power to stronger subchannels. The signal scaling en-\nables us to derive a closed-form expression for the Lagrange multi-\nplier, which is employed to consider a transmit power constraint [18].\nAn iterative algorithm for minimizing the MSE under a total transmit\npower constraint is derived, and its characteristics are analyzed. It will\nbe shown that the proposed algorithm, termed the modified T-MMSE\n(MT-MMSE), can outperform the existing methods irrespective of the\nSNR.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. Section II describes the\nmultiuser MIMO system model. The proposed method is then derived\nand analyzed in Section III. Section IV presents computer simulation\nresults to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed processors. Fi-\nnally, Section V presents the conclusion.\nII. MULTIUSER MIMO SYSTEM MODEL\nThe system configuration of a multiuser MIMO downlink with\nK users, NT transmit antennas, and NR;k receive antennas,\nk 2 f1; 2; . . . ; Kg, is shown in Fig. 1. The MIMO channel is\nrepresented asHk 2 N \u0002N , where the entries are independently\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.) zero-mean complex Gaussian random\nvariables with a unit variance. The (m;n)th entry represents the com-\nplex gain from the nth transmit antenna to the mth receive antenna. It\nis assumed that all fHkg are known at the transmitter, while the kth\nreceiver only knows its own MIMO channel. This assumption indicates\nthat the multiuser interference should be suppressed at the transmitter\nvia preprocessing. The spatial multiplexing is performed by forming\na vector signal xk with Lk symbols, xk 2 L \u00021, preprocessing\neach vector by Tk , where Tk 2 N \u0002L is the transmit-processing\nmatrix, and combining the preprocessed vectors from the users to\nyield K\nk=1\nTkxk . Following this, the elements of Kk=1Tkxk\nare transmitted through different antennas. At the kth receiver, the\nreceived signal Hk Kj=1Tjxj + nk , where nk 2\nN \u00021 is a\n1After the channel diagonalization, the equivalent channel gain matrix, which\ndescribes the cascade of transmit\u2013receive processing and the physical channel,\nbecomes a diagonal matrix. Channel inversion is a special case of channel di-\nagonalization in which the equivalent channel gain is given by a normalized\nidentity matrix.\n1053-587X\/$25.00 \u00a9 2007 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.
