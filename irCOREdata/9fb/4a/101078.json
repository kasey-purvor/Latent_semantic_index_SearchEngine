Whether e-resources are somehow distinct\nfrom printed collections and should be treated as\nsuch, or whether libraries should present a unified\ncollection to their users, has been hotly debated\nsince the arrival of e-journals, and will become an\nincreasingly important issue as libraries\u2019 e-resource\ncollections continue to expand. At the University\nof Surrey (UniS) the decision was taken in 2005 to\nbegin cataloguing the existing collection of e-books.\nThis case-study will examine the challenges that\nare being faced at UniS as MAchine-Readable\nCatalog(u)ing (MARC) records begin to be\nimported and created for these resources. It will\nlook at the unique cataloguing problems that the \ne-book format presents, and will explore the issues\nsurrounding the relationship of electronic and\nprinted books. Finally, it will consider the future\nfor cataloguing procedures as e-resource collec-\ntions become more and more important to libraries\nand end-users.\nThe potential of e-books\nThere has been a considerable amount of excite-\nment surrounding the arrival of the e-book.\nHowever, in reality e-books have been relatively\nslow to catch on; as Clifford Lynch remarks: \u2018I\nsuspect more words are being published about the\ne-book phenomenon in print than have actually\nbeen placed into e-books so far.\u20191 The excitement\nsurrounding this format lies in its potential\ncapabilities: the e-book \u2013 a digital or electronic\nrepresentation of a printed book \u2013 can be made\navailable to the user at any time and anywhere. It\ncan also offer greater functionality than the printed\nitem, including cross-referencing, hyperlinks to\nother sources and enhanced searchability. For\ninformation professionals, collection management\nissues such as storage, space and deterioration of\nstock are potentially solved by electronic collections.\nYet, current technologies mean that on-screen\nreading is still uncomfortable and that reading\nfrom print is the preferred choice for many. E-book\ncollections are therefore still in their infancy and,\nfor those who have begun to purchase or license\nthis format, how to manage these resources\nremains unclear. \nThe cataloguing of e-books at the University \nof Surrey \nMany libraries are investing more and more in e-books, yet the\nbibliographic implications for managing these resources are only just\nbecoming apparent. This case-study focuses on the experience of the\nUniversity of Surrey after the decision was taken to import and create\nMARC records for e-books. It explores the relationship between\nelectronic resources and \u2018core\u2019 holdings, and the role of the library\ncatalogue as the primary source of information. Further, it examines\nthe practical challenges faced by staff when cataloguing electronic\nmaterial, including whether to create \u2018hybrid\u2019 or separate records for\nprint and electronic copies, and considerations surrounding the content\nand granularity of records. Cataloguing e-books can be an effective way\nof helping users to discover these new resources. However, it is\nbecoming clear that libraries will need to re-evaluate traditional\nprocedures as they examine the new priorities of these unique\nresources.\nKAREN GRAVETT\nLibrary Assistant,\nCataloguing\nUniversity of Surrey\nLibrary\nE-books at UniS\nE-books began to be purchased at the University \nof Surrey in 2001. Feedback from students was\npositive, and they reported that they were keen \nto use e-books more.2 UniS has therefore been\ngradually expanding its e-book holdings and has\nrecently signed up to Ebrary\u2019s \u2018Academic\nComplete\u2019 package. The students at UniS now have\naccess to thousands of titles: in just this package\nalone, users can access almost 30,000. However, the\ne-book \u2018collection\u2019 at UniS is not unified, but is\nfragmented into a variety of different packages,\npurchased or licensed from a variety of suppliers.\nAs well as Ebrary, these include netLibrary\n(currently the main supplier of e-books to\nacademic libraries), Business Source Premier, CRC\nnetbase, PsycBOOKS, World Tourism Organization,\nKnowUK, and Xreferplus. Each e-book package is\ndifferent and comes with different licensing terms\nand viewing restrictions, for example, netLibrary\nrestrict the number of simultaneous users while\nEbrary do not. The format and functionality of \ne-books also varies from package to package. \nInitially, individual e-books were not catalogued.\nThe packages were all linked from the library\nhome page, forming a separate collection from\ntraditional print holdings. Later, the decision was\ntaken to catalogue all of the netLibrary titles. In\n2005 the library began looking into cataloguing\nindividual e-book titles across all packages. \nThe decision to catalogue e-books\nThe decision to catalogue e-books was based\nprimarily on the need for users easily to discover\nthese resources.3 The main access point to the\nlibrary\u2019s collections is the library Online Public\nAccess Catalogue (OPAC) and it was felt that it\nwas important for e-books to be accessible there in\norder to exploit these new resources fully. The\nlibrary OPAC at UniS (Talis Prism) includes a\nsearchable \u2018electronic book\u2019 subset within its\nadvanced search page and thus titles can be\nlocated both purposefully and serendipitously by\nusers. Although it is currently too early to measure\nusage statistics effectively at UniS, other libraries\nhave found that cataloguing e-books significantly\nincreases their use: at the University of Texas, after\nadding records to the online catalogue, usage\nincreased immediately, and by about 50% over\nthree months.4 Similarly, netLibrary argue that\n\u2018integrating eBook MARC records into your OPAC\nis the single most important step you can take \nto ensure successful adoption of your eBook\ncollection.\u2019 5\nThe decision to catalogue therefore seems\nstraightforward. However, there are a number of\nissues that are raised by the integration of e-books\ninto the OPAC, and that surround the relationship\nof electronic resources to the \u2018traditional collec-\ntion\u2019. Many libraries use a gateway approach for \ne-resource collections such as e-journals and the\neffect of this is that e-resources are isolated from\nthe library\u2019s \u2018core\u2019 holdings. Whether the library\ndoes in fact wish to create a variety of discrete\ncollections, or whether, as has traditionally been\nthe case, the library catalogue should remain the\nprimary source of information, is something that\nwill need to be considered by information profes-\nsionals. For e-books, their organization within\ncollections is further complicated by confusion\nover what an e-book actually represents: whether\nthey are simply \u2018hi-tech photocopies\u2019 or a unique\nentity in themselves is a question that has impli-\ncations for how the resource is catalogued as well\nas how it should be accessed. \nThe cataloguing and importing process \nThe information in this case-study was gained\nfrom observations of practice, experience taken from\nworking at the University of Surrey, and interviews\nwith staff members. In 2005, UniS began importing\ncatalogue records into the Talis Library Manage-\nment System. For many of the e-book packages,\nsuppliers were offering downloadable MARC21\nrecords that could be imported into the catalogue\n(and were converted to the UKMARC version still\nin use, TalisMARC). This would therefore be\nextremely time-saving and require the cataloguing\ndepartment to edit and upgrade records rather\nthan catalogue manually. For those packages that\ndid not supply MARC records, for example, the\nWorld Tourism Organization, original records would\nbe created. Following discussions with staff at\nPortsmouth University, based on their own experi-\nence, the decision was taken to import records in\nbatches rather than all at once. From July 2005,\nrecords began to be imported, initially onto the\nMIS (back-up) server and finally onto the live\nserver, and packages began to be upgraded by the\nSerials \u2013 19(3), November 2006 Karen Gravett Cataloguing e-books at the University of Surrey\n203\nCataloguing e-books at the University of Surrey Karen Gravett Serials \u2013 19(3), November 2006\n204\ncataloguing team. In 2006, records for the World\nTourism Organization package began to be created\nand templates for different kinds of e-book records\nwere made.\nImporting issues\nWhen importing records a number of problems\nwere experienced. On occasions, and particularly\nwhen a record for the print copy of the e-book title\nexisted in the catalogue, records would fail to\nimport. Conversely, sometimes duplicate records\nwere imported, with more than one item on one\nwork record. This meant that the importing\nprocess took longer than expected, in part due to\nthe fact that the Library Management System,\nTalis, was unused to importing records on a\nregular basis as it enables catalogue records to be\ndownloaded from its union catalogue, Talis Base.\nSometimes individual fields would fail to import\nwithin records. One example of this was the 008\nfield. This was particularly frustrating as, owing to\na defect within the Talis Alto system, it was not\npossible to manually insert this field. The im-\nporting procedure also had knock-on effects for the\nauthority control process as the workload of\nauthorizing new catalogue entries was greatly\nincreased by the inclusion of the large amount of \ne-book records into the catalogue. \nCataloguing and upgrading issues\nFor cataloguing purposes there were a number of\ndecisions that needed to be made. The first was the\nchoice between using a single \u2018hybrid\u2019 record for\nthe print and electronic copies and using separate\nrecords for each. Practice for this has not yet been\nwidely established by academic libraries, and the\nsituation at the time was that libraries made their\nown local choices in this matter. There were a\nnumber of factors to consider: using one record\nwould help users easily locate the electronic copy\nfrom the print record, yet using two records would\nmake the updating process easier to manage.\nInitially, e-links to electronic copies were added to\nthe print records in order to help users navigate\nbetween the two formats. Yet as new editions were\npublished, e-book links were being updated, while\nthe links on printed records became obsolete.\nFurthermore, e-books often have unique infor-\nmation, for example, an e-ISBN and a different\npublication date, so joint records could look\nconfusing and jumbled. There was also the\nproblem of items that are born digital and do not\nhave a printed counterpart. After assessing these\nissues, and looking at the example of other\nuniversities, UniS chose to use separate records for\neach item. This decision supported the idea that\nthe two resources are independent from one\nanother and have different functionality, rather\nthan that the e-book is simply a replica of the\nprinted text, a \u2018high-tech photocopy\u2019. \nEstablishing what information to include within\nrecords was another issue that needed to be\naddressed. One problem was confusion about\npublisher information. Some packages such as\nKnowUK would cite the provider as the publisher\nof the book, while others would use the publi-\ncation details of the printed version. This was an\nimportant issue to standardize as students would\nclearly need to reference the resources in their\nwork. Similarly, whether to include classmarks\nwithin records was also a question that needed to\nbe answered. After exploring the practice of other\nuniversities, UniS chose to do this and to use a\nstandard classmark of \u2018electronic book\u2019. The\ngranularity of records was also an issue. When\nbeginning to catalogue the netLibrary records,\nrecords included a high level of detail, for example\nnotes providing information on Athens passwords,\nthe source of the title proper, and the date the title\nwas viewed. Yet, with the e-book collection\nexpanding, it was soon realized it would not be\npossible to continue at this level of cataloguing.\nMoreover, it became apparent that some of these\nfields could cause problems as the information\nincluded was not static. Changing from using\nAthens to a new authentication system, for example,\nwould mean that each record would have to be\naltered. Ultimately, this information relating to\npasswords and access was instead added to the\nlibrary web pages.\nImporting a variety of conflicting records into\nthe catalogue, and tailoring these to local procedures\nand system requirements, meant that a large amount\nof upgrading was necessary. Sometimes indicators\non records, or capitalization errors, needed to be\nchanged. Links also proved problematic. Some-\ntimes they contained the incorrect direction and\nhad to be amended for the access route that UniS\nprovided. Records might also provide the 856 link\nbut, as Talis uses a hotlink function instead, this\noften led to two links being visible to users on the\nOPAC, and thus records had to be amended. The\nsheer number of records made any upgrading a\ntime-consuming task. Although changes were\nSerials \u2013 19(3), November 2006 Karen Gravett Cataloguing e-books at the University of Surrey\n205\nsmall, often hundreds of records would need to be\nedited.\nAnalysis\nThe experience of the University of Surrey reveals\nthat there are a number of considerations that are\nunique to the cataloguing of electronic resources\nand that, as Lee and Boyle argue, often procedures\n\u2018modelled in the print world will not suffice\u2019.6\nThe sheer size of electronic collections is one of \nthe main reasons printed models cannot easily be\ntransposed onto electronic works. At UniS, the level\nof granularity that would ideally be used for\ncatalogue records, and was suggested by sources\nsuch as the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules\n(AACR), was shown to be impractical for thousands\nof e-book records. As Mitchell and Surratt explain: \n\u2018What makes online resources unusual are their\ngrowing numbers, their tendency to become available\nin large clusters or collections are activated rather\nthan as a continuous stream of incoming material.\u20197\nUnlike printed items that are purchased one by\none, e-books are bundled and sold or licensed via\nlarge packages. Even small changes to records\nbecame laborious when dealing with hundreds of\nitems. \nYet another reason why printed models will not\neasily suffice is that the information within the\nrecords for electronic items will often need to be\nprioritized differently. Previously, cataloguing had\nfocused on the bibliographic description of items,\nbut for electronic resources, access and password\ninformation, sources of the title proper and the\nroutes for linking to the resources become more\nimportant than describing the physical scope or\ndimensions of the item. The provision of this\ninformation is further complicated by the dynamic\nnature of the electronic resource. Unlike a record\nfor a printed item, the record for an e-book is not\nstatic. Links and password procedures change, as\noccasionally do names of providers. Yet, changes\nto thousands of individual records are not easily\nmade. \nThe experience revealed that e-book cataloguing\nis still a nascent field and that there is a lack of\nguidance in this area. Information professionals\nsimply do not have access to the same amount of\nsupport that exists for printed collection manage-\nment. National deposit libraries are still only\ncollecting the voluntary deposit of e-books,8 and,\nas discovered by the E-books working group,\nAACR\u2019s treatment of e-resources is still in need \nof revision.9 Mitchell and Surratt explain: \u2018The\nstandards for managing electronic collections tend\nto evolve more slowly than the resources them-\nselves\u2019.10 With the formats and possibilities of\nelectronic resources changing rapidly, it is not\nsurprising that the bibliographic implications have\nnot been fully examined.\nConclusions and recommendations\nIt is paramount that users are aware of the\nelectronic resources that libraries are investing in.\nThus, the decision to import or to create catalogue\nrecords for e-books is a route worth considering by\nlibraries as a way of signposting the end-user to\nthese collections. It is also a decision that allows\nlibraries to conserve the library catalogue as the\nprimary access point for the library\u2019s holdings, and\nto avoid presenting users with diverse, discrete\ncollections. Providing a searchable subset for\nelectronic books within the OPAC is also a good\nway of allowing collections to be accessed and\nsearched. \nThere still exists a lack of guidance within this\narea. However, the experience of staff at UniS\nshows that libraries can find support from col-\nlaborating with others in a similar position. At\nUniS, discussions with professionals at Portsmouth\nUniversity, Sheffield University and the University\nof the West of England (UWE) meant that staff\nwere able to gain advice from others who had\nalready experienced similar problems. Electronic\nspaces for collaboration can also serve as a useful\nplace for communication. UniS made use of spaces\nsuch as the Talis forum11 and the Joint Information\nSystems Committee mailing list (JISCmail) LIS-E-\nBOOKs12 for queries and as a space for discussion,\nand libraries should take advantage of these\nopportunities to share their experiences and gain\nsupport, particularly when going through a similar\nperiod of transition.\nThe importing of MARC records from providers\ncreated a number of issues for systems and\ncataloguing staff at UniS. Nonetheless, even\ndespite the upgrading required, the availability of\nimportable records was extremely time-saving.\nUltimately, manual cataloguing of the thousands\nof records would have been impossible, so the\nCataloguing e-books at the University of Surrey Karen Gravett Serials \u2013 19(3), November 2006\n206\nimporting of batch records is a viable direction for\nother libraries to consider. However, providers are\nonly in the early stages of beginning to supply\nMARC records to their customers and it is\nimportant for them to realize the need for libraries\nto have access to reliable and standardized infor-\nmation. Although netLibrary\u2019s MARC records are\ncreated by the Online Computer Library Center\n(OCLC), a reliable source, records from many other\nproviders do not have the same degree of\nauthority. The provision of more reliable records\nfrom providers would make the burden on\nlibraries significantly easier.\nFor libraries undertaking a similar process, there\nis also a need for a greater understanding of the\nunique nature of electronic material. The exper-\nience of UniS revealed that cataloguing e-resources\nis in many ways a different process from\ntraditional cataloguing. This understanding will\nbecome increasingly important as providers create\nelectronic resources that move further and further\naway from the printed text, incorporating wider\nfunctionality and greater exploiting the potential\nof online technologies. Yet because of the changing\nnature of this area, libraries also need to be flexible\nin their approach. The experience of UniS staff\nrevealed that in reality, plans often had to be\nmodified, as in the case of the importing process\nwhich took longer than expected, and that there\nare procedural implications, as in the example of\nthe level of information within records that had to\nbe reconsidered. Ultimately, libraries will need to\nbe flexible as they explore fully the bibliographic\nimplications of these dynamic resources, and will\nneed to re-evaluate traditional procedures in the\nlight of changing priorities.\nReferences\n1.
