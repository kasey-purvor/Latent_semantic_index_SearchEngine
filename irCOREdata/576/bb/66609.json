This article explores some of the tensions and interaction between two rival conceptions of\nthe relationship between citizenship and patriotism in twentieth-century England. The first was widespread\namong the intellectual elite and greatly qualified the role of patriotism in sustaining a higher ideal of\ncitizenship. The second was generally the preserve of popular writers and activists who conceived citizenship\nin terms of patriotic attachment to the English and English-British nation. However, the article maintains\nthat the Edwardian intellectual elite often assumed an homogeneous national culture as the basis of suc-\ncessful citizenship, both local and international. In this regard, despite subjection to increasing strain,\ncontinuity as much as change is apparent in conceptions of citizenship up to and including the interventions of\nEnoch Powell in the debate over mass immigration. Subsequent attempts to ground citizenship in difference\nrather than sameness have greatly intensified the tension with a more persistent culture of patriotism.\nIn a recent study Krishan Kumar has argued convincingly that a shared national\nidentity in England is little more than a century old. Against a growing trend of\nmedievalists to locate the origins of Englishness as far back as the age of Bede,\nand early modernists to favour the sixteenth century in this regard, Kumar\nemphasizes the \u2018moment \u2019 of English nationhood as the turn of the nineteenth\ncentury and the erosion of British industrial and imperial supremacy. Previously,\nEnglish national awareness had been weak due to a range of competing loyalties \u2013\nsupra-national and sub-national ; England\u2019s ascendancy within the wider British\nnation also served to suppress its development. Even when national consciousness\nflowered in England in the late nineteenth century its expression was typically\ncultural, in the longer term remaining distinct from the more political varieties of\ncontinental nationalism to which \u2013 for a short while \u2013 it bore some resemblance.1\nHowever, Kumar\u2019s analysis considerably underplays widespread ambivalence\namong the intellectual elite towards the enhanced self-consciousness of the\nEnglish nation at the end of the nineteenth century, unlike the active encour-\nagement which many of its counterparts in continental Europe gave to similar\n* I am extremely grateful to the following for their helpful suggestions on an earlier draft : Stefan\nCollini, Peter Mandler, Peter P.

This arose from a concern that the ideal of citizenship\nassociated with the development of democracy should not be debased by an\nunreflective patriotism hitched to a strong sense of nationhood. Two distinct but\ninterrelated cultures can be seen to have emerged from this clash : one centred on\ncitizenship, the other on patriotism.\nThe concept of citizenship promoted by an academic community of philo-\nsophers, classicists, social scientists, and political thinkers was rooted in an attach-\nment to the state as the supreme focus of collective loyalty, identity, and the\ncommon good. They were generally wary of the emotive language of nationhood,\nemphasizing instead the importance of democratic, liberal, and civic values based\non reason. They by no means excluded the possibility that the will of society\npresently embodied in states would expand to form the basis of a sovereign\ninternational community, a development to be warmly welcomed.2 Indeed,\nadvocates of citizenship often assumed a level of cohesion and patriotic charge akin\nto that of their own society as a precondition of widening social sentiment, while\nat the same time seeking to sublimate its \u2018national \u2019 character. Although the\ncitizenship ideal was cultivated primarily in academic circles, it was successfully\nprojected well beyond. For example, the Idealist philosophers Bernard Bosanquet\nand J. S. Mackenzie spread what was in effect a gospel of citizenship in the\nCharity Organization Society and the Civic Education League respectively ; they\nalso published with non-academic publishers and in non-specialist journals.3\nAt the same time but in other quarters, vigorous attempts were made to define\nthe citizen in terms of the English patriot. This ideal was championed by writers\nand activists who served broad public audiences. These audiences undoubtedly\noverlapped with those to whom the ethic of citizenship was addressed. However,\nquite plausibly, the audience for patriotism held up as that of its rival contracted\nas the pace of academic specialization and professionalization accelerated.\nThe ideal of patriotism emphasized the primacy of the nation over the state\nand the impossibility, indeed incoherence, of a world in which national ties had\nbeen significantly loosened.4 The support of avowed patriots for their state was\nnot always guaranteed, especially when it threatened to subjugate other peoples,\n2 For example, for Idealist thinkers in this vein, see D. Boucher, \u2018British Idealism, the state, and\ninternational relations\u2019, Journal of the History of Ideas, 55 (1994), pp. 671\u201394.\n3 On Bosanquet and the Charity Organization Society, see S. Collini, \u2018Hobhouse, Bosanquet and\nthe state : philosophical idealism and political argument in England, 1880\u20131918\u2019, Past and Present, 72\n(1976), pp. 86\u2013111. On Mackenzie and the Civic Education League, see his offer to write a book on\ncitizenship for the Home University Library at the request of the League in letters to Gilbert Murray,\n17 Dec. 1919 and 15 Jan. 1924, Bodleian Library, Oxford, MSS Murray, 406\/167 and 407\/1. On the\nCivic Education League, an organization which became an arm of Le Play House and the Institute of\nSociology, see D. F. T. Evans, \u2018Le Play House and the regional survey movement in British sociology,\n1920\u20131955\u2019 (M.Phil. thesis, City of Birmingham Polytechnic, 1986).\n4 G. K. Chesterton asked the cosmopolitan \u2018who professes to love humanity and hate local\npreference \u2026: \u2018\u2018How can you love humanity and hate anything so human?\u2019\u2019 \u2019 : \u2018The patriotic idea\u2019, in\nL.

H. Grainger has\nwritten of the diverse patriotisms of Edwardian England, \u2018Kings, Lords and\nCommons and Church articulated and represented the continuities, remained\ndeeply expressive of ancient cohesion but did not set the patria in motion\u2019.7 This is\nclear in the founding of the Royal Society of St George in 1894 by Howard Ruff,\nto \u2018 strengthen\u2026and maintain\u2026that spirit of nationality and sentiment of race\nwhich should associate all of kindred blood wherever dispersed\u2019.8 For the\nSociety \u2013 as for later figures such as George Orwell (briefly) and Enoch\nPowell \u2013 citizenship and patriotism were two, co-equal sides of a larger national\ncoin. Patriotic identification with English nationhood at this thin end of a thick\nnationalist wedge \u2013 the concept of the English \u2018race \u2019 was not inherently racist and\na seed-ground of intolerance9 \u2013 merits close examination ; it does so particularly\nin relation to the ideals of collective national life pursued by academic thinkers.\nWhile the alignment of patriotism and English nationhood may not have led to a\n5 H.

Clark, Our shadowed present : modernism, postmodernism and history (London, 2003), pp. 61\u20132, 88,\n96. Clark both underestimates the strength of patriotism in England, Britain, and the United Kingdom\nand its basis in nationality. He claims that certain \u2018group\u2019 identities prevailed over the nation in all\nthree contexts, rooted in \u2018allegiance, shared history, liberty, law, superior civilization and the polity\u2019s\nplace within a scenario of the historical development of Christendom\u2019: p. 93. This is undeniable but\nsuch bonds were arguably constitutive of, rather than alternatives to, the various senses of nationhood\nhere.\n7 J. H. Grainger, Patriotisms : Britain, 1900\u20131940 (London, 1986), p. 64. I draw upon but seek to\nextend this fine book in the present article.\n8 Letter to the editor, signed by Alfred Bower, lord mayor, and nine other officers of the Society,\nThe English Race, Journal of the Royal Society of St George, 38 (Aug. 1926), p. 6. In the early 1880s,\ndismayed by the lack of English national consciousness and also ignorance of the role which England\nhad played in the building of empire, Ruff initiated the practice of wearing a rose on St George\u2019s Day.\nHe gave up farming and rural pursuits to devote himself full time to the cause of English patriotism,\nleaving the whole of his residuary estate on the death of his wife to Trustees for the Society he had\nfounded: see his obituary, The English Race, 47 (Mar. 1929), pp. 8\u20139. The Society is overlooked by\nKumar, Clark, and even Grainger.\n9 For opposing views, see for example, T. Kusher and K. Lunn, Traditions of intolerance : historical\nperspectives on fascism and race discourse in Britain (Manchester, 1989). Anti-Semitism, in particular, was\ncertainly present in political thought, even on the Left : see, for example, V. Geoghegan, \u2018Edward\nCarpenter\u2019s England revisited\u2019, History of Political Thought, 24 (2003), pp. 509\u201327. But evidence of the\nexclusivity of English self-projection in political thought and action is not uniform: an ardent patriot\nwho vociferously opposed anti-alien hysteria in Edwardian Britain is Winston Churchill. His campaign\nagainst the Aliens Bill in 1904 won him the support of Nathan Laski \u2013 father of Harold Laski \u2013 and the\nseat of North-West Manchester for the Liberal party: see I. Kramnick and B. Sheerman, Harold Laski :\na life on the Left (London, 1993), pp. 20\u20135.\nC I T I Z E N S H I P V E R S U S P A T R I O T I S M 153\nseparate political party, arguably it more than matched the citizenship culture in\ndefining England \u2013 and Britain10 \u2013 as national communities, and shaping opinion\non a wide range of issues for much of the twentieth century and beyond.\nThis article charts some of the tensions and interaction between these two\ncultures of citizenship and patriotism since around 1900, and emphasizes the\nweight of their historical legacy. Neither was particularly exercised by the sig-\nnificant race, class, and gender inequalities that compromised the legal definition\nof nationality and citizenship, especially in the first half of the twentieth century ;\nhowever, this was potentially more serious for the citizenship paradigm, depen-\ndent as it was upon the possession and exercise of actual political rights for the\nexpression of communal identity and will. It is also important to emphasize at the\noutset that both cultures were informed to varying degrees by a broad-based\nliberalism that cut across the boundaries of conservatism and socialism; con-\nsequently, polarization of the two cultures on Left\u2013Right lines has been limited.\nThe wider lines of division ran instead along an internationalist\u2013nationalist axis\nthat was by no means mutually exclusive, however weak at times the commitment\nto one side may have become on the part of those who prioritized the other. The\narticle maintains that the two cultures remained relatively stable at a conceptual\nlevel until the late twentieth century when attempts to renew the culture of\ncitizenship cast off much of the simultaneous concern with ethical, class, and\n(implicitly) national homogeneity that had sustained earlier citizenship discourse.\nIn this context, conflict with a more persistent ideal of patriotism intensified; at\nthe same time, the audiences of the two cultures finally broke apart.\nI\nIntellectuals in Britain had not always been hostile to the cause of the nation.\nLiberal nationalism with respect to oppressed nations abroad had been widely\nembraced by the mid- to late Victorian intelligentsia. As Peter Mandler has\nargued, while large parts of an essentially liberal elite had recoiled in horror from\nthe 1848 revolutions in Europe, by the 1860s an equally significant number had\nwarmed to the democratic principles, especially, on which the claims of the\nnation to determine its own destiny seemed to be founded.11 One notable voice of\ndissent \u2013 Lord Acton \u2013 approached nationalism from the combined perspectives\nof continental politics and Roman Catholicism. Significantly, he distrusted\n10 For the view that English traits often became synonymous with Britishness after 1900, especially\nas the Protestantism on which British identity had traded heavily in previous centuries diminished in\nforce, see J.

R. Seeley, well illustrates this\nwider indifference. For Seeley, \u2018England\u2019 was virtually meaningless outside of the\nimperial state to which it had been harnessed; in this sense the pre-history of\nEngland was far older than its history proper, and of little bearing.15 The strongest\ninvocation of English national character and identity as source rather than\nconsequence of empire came from J. F. Stephen. This was in reaction against the\nresurgence of Catholicism in the latter half of the nineteenth century on the one\nhand, and the perceived cosmopolitanism of popular liberals such as Richard\nCobden and John Bright on the other.16 But Stephen\u2019s ideas found little response\namong his contemporaries. More typical of the attitude of the intelligentsia\ntowards English nationhood was the view of his fellow lawyer, A. V. Dicey, that\nthe English people could take most pride in the absence of national pride,\nparticularly among their politicians and political intellectuals, if not poets and\nwriters ; such signal lack of nationalist feeling was, at the very least, the source\nof unparalleled freedom.17 While this essentially inverted form of nationalism\ncould be accompanied by a close identity with the Anglo-Saxon race, the\nlatter was frequently interpreted in terms of a widely dispersed people with\ncommon ties and affections rather than biological race or nationhood more\nnarrowly.18 For Dicey, the Anglo-Saxon race provided the basis on which bridges\nof \u2018common citizenship\u2019 could be built across geographical and constitutional\ndivides. He emphasized the value of binding England closer to her former\nAmerican colonies on the basis of \u2018common legal conceptions \u2019 and associated\n12 See T.

Partly this was due to disquiet about the illiberal, racist turn of\nEuropean nationalist movements.20 The British empire was also instrumental in\nheightening suspicion of the nation in such circles. Following reports of unseemly\nbehaviour by the crowds on Mafeking night, the young J. M. Keynes identified a\ncult of \u2018patrophobia \u2019 in intellectual life, as strong \u2013 and even to his Liberal\nmind \u2013 as distasteful as that of \u2018 jingoism\u2019 beyond.21 For progressive liberals such\nas L. T. Hobhouse, imperialism had corrupted patriotism by transforming legit-\nimate pride in national independence into chauvinism and aggrandisement. At\nthe same time the imperialist spirit of the triumphant nation threatened to subvert\nthe movement of democratic citizenship at home, dependent as empire was on\nauthoritative government abroad.22 According to Hobhouse, liberalism some-\ntimes had to take risks with nationalism and recognize the claim of subject\npeoples, like the Irish, to full political rights ; their case was unanswerable, unlike\nthat of the sectarian Protestant minority in the north.23 But whenever liberalism\nacted thus, it did so with a heavy heart.\nIt was left to the popular patriotic leagues of Edwardian England \u2013 for\nexample, the Navy League, the Tariff Reform League, and the Victoria\nLeague \u2013 loudly to extol England\u2019s achievements and the virtue of national\nloyalty, particularly in the context of empire.24 While liberal intellectual figure-\nheads of the Leagues were not unknown \u2013 for example, Spencer Wilkinson,\nco-founder of the Navy League25 \u2013 their closest, albeit unacknowledged, ally was\nthe Left. Since the 1880s, despite internal opposition, the Left had sought to\nregain the sense of common English and English-British nationhood that had\n19 A. V.

It is evident from his meticulous research\ninto English language textbooks that patriotic values and ideals of nationhood\nwere certainly boosted by the teaching profession in this way. But nationalist\nsensibilities were filtered primarily through the \u2018prism\u2019 of citizenship, and with\nthe interests of the state in \u2018rational \u2019 loyalty and obedience from a population\nstill largely denied political rights kept firmly in view. In other words, nationhood\nwas promoted in schools as a surrogate for full citizen status. Furthermore, as\nHeathorn makes clear, unease about too overtly nationalist an agenda was not\nunknown in educational circles, over and above a concern to avoid the propa-\ngandist and partisan aims of the patriotic Leagues.28 Finally, such provision as\nthere was for nationalist education in Britain signally failed to satisfy the patriotic\ndie-hards \u2013 for example, Arthur Boutwood, Lord Roberts, Lord Milner, and\nLord Baden-Powell \u2013 who looked enviously at Germany, the United States, and\nJapan.29 These figures invested their hopes instead in youth organizations such as\nthe Boy Scouts movement which were not hindered by the reluctance of public\nauthorities to address the needs of the patria head-on.\nAgainst this backdrop, the ideal of the rational citizen \u2013 both virtual and\nactual \u2013 clashed heavily with the engaged patriot as competing embodiments of\npolitical virtue before 1914. An alternative model of the engaged citizen in conflict\nrather than harmony with the state was developed by militant suffragettes and\nother disempowered groups who attacked the exclusivity of citizenship in the\ndominant liberal understandings of the term. But the overall fault lines between\nrational citizenship and patriotic attachment to the community of the nation\nremained intact.30 Of course, as we shall see, citizenship culture was never\n26 P.

At the same time a progressive liberal such as J. A. Hobson\ncould be cautiously receptive to the emotional life of crowds which underpinned\npatriotism and other ends transcending the self ; this he saw as a necessary\ncorrective to the abstractions of elite political theory.31 Nevertheless, the domi-\nnant liberal ideals of citizenship, at least, were distinctive for being articulated\nprimarily in moral rather than overtly national and even legal terms. The tone was\nwell struck by James Bryce in his Yale Lectures on \u2018the responsibilities of\ncitizenship \u2019 in 1909. Bryce emphasized the shortcomings of contemporary\nmankind with regard to civic duty, for which he believed a blind patriotism was\npartly to blame. Admonishing the people of both Britain and America for not\n\u2018caring enough for [their] country \u2019, he declared :\nIt is easy to wave a flag, to cheer an eminent statesman, to exult in some achievement by\nland or sea. But our imaginations are too dull to realize either the grandeur of the State in\nits splendid opportunities for promoting the welfare of the masses, or the fact that the\nnobility of the State lies in its being the true child, the true exponent, of the enlightened will\nof a right-minded and law-abiding people.32\nAs Roberto Romani has emphasized, citizenship for Bryce was essentially a\ndiscipline for the lack of rational collective direction consequent upon\ndemocracy.33\nI I\nThe concern to channel patriotic sentiment and duty into citizenship and away\nfrom nationhood was greatly enhanced by the neo-Idealist revival in Britain.34\nLed by T. H. Green, an Oxford contemporary of Dicey and Bryce before his\nearly death in 1882, Idealism provided a powerful philosophical foundation for\nthe spirit of altruism, self-sacrifice, and obligation which seized the governing\nand intellectual classes in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. In this\ncontext, the hopes for the future of society held by Idealist thinkers such as\nSir Henry Jones were crystallized in the concept of citizenship as a dissolvent\nof class differences and the basis of self-realization within a wider social\n31 G.

Green thus turned to Aristotle\u2019s Ethics\nas the mainspring of the philosophy of human brotherhood centred on the state to\nwhich Christianity had merely given a new zeal and more extensive application.36\nGreen was certainly not impervious to patriotism as a vehicle of his moral and\npolitical ends. In his Lectures on the principles of political obligation (1879\u201380) he praised\nthe spirit of patriotism \u2013 with its roots in \u2018common ways of feeling and think-\ning \u2019 \u2013 as an exemplar of the will for the common good which he believed was the\nsource of all human perfection.37 For Green the \u2018 intelligent patriot \u2019 was the key\nsource of the moral life of society conceived in Kantian, universalistic terms; the\nintelligent patriot is the conscientious citizen of the posthumously published\nProlegomena to ethics (1883), whose moral strivings keep a society\u2019s ethical ideals alive\nand growing.\nYet Green kept the ends of the state strictly in perspective : its purpose was not\nto enhance national power or cultural identity but to ensure the spiritual and\nmaterial well-being of its citizens.38 He was once purported to have said that \u2018he\nwould rather see the flag of England trailed in the dirt than add sixpence to the\ntaxes that weigh upon the poor \u2019.39 It was a conception of \u2018 true \u2019 patriotism that he\nreiterated before packed public meetings of Liberal Associations in and around\nOxford in the late 1870s at the height of Disraeli\u2019s foreign campaigns.40\nFurthermore, \u2018 true\u2019 patriotism required continuing democratic reform in the\n35 On the contrast between Henry Jones and T.

Writing against the\nbackdrop of the South African war, Boutwood championed the virtues of patriotism and national\nsentiment as integral to good citizenship; citizens should not denounce their country before its\nenemies, even on the few occasions when \u2018national policy\u2019 was mistaken. Boutwood denied that (British)\nnational policy was ever immoral : see H.

This piece discusses the decline of the collective\nsense of national honour in large, heterogeneous states, resurfacing only in times of war. It was a\npositive development as far as Green was concerned. Crucial to the process was the establishment of\nthe higher laws of \u2018 justice\u2019 and equality of personal rights. In other words common citizenship has\nsupplanted exclusive \u2018common feeling\u2019 and lack of any \u2018regard for man as such\u2019 upon which \u2013 Green\nbelieved \u2013 national honour thrives to the detriment of society.\nC I T I Z E N S H I P V E R S U S P A T R I O T I S M 159\ninterests of \u2018 full \u2019 citizenship, a view which Green maintained even after the defeat\nof the Liberal party in 1874 on an extended suffrage.41\nThe spirit of Green\u2019s views on citizenship and patriotism was reiterated by his\ndisciple, Bernard Bosanquet, for all his greater optimism about social relations in\nBritain at the turn of the nineteenth century. Society, Bosanquet maintained, in\nhis Philosophical theory of the state in 1899, was increasingly constituted by an \u2018organic\nunity \u2019 of experience across its diverse parts through internalization of a common\ngood expressed in the General Will. Citizenship was thus rooted in sameness, the\nintegration of differences and their \u2018completion\u2019 at a higher level in the state.42\nBosanquet did not rule out dissent and even disobedience in the attainment of this\nend, within the limits, that is, of broad acceptance of the state and its benefits\nwhich clearly distinguished his conception of citizenship from that of the suffra-\ngettes and other radicals. Like Green, he assumed a symbiosis between citizenship\nand democratic inclusion in the widest sense.43 However, this left little scope for\nthe cultivation of nationhood per se, even pending the universal status of citi-\nzenship, as in elementary schools. Bosanquet could consistently support the\nLeague of Nations since in his view nations were simply \u2018 sovereign communities \u2019\nwith common moral features as well as their own particularity.44 Patriotism was\nthe handmaid of this unifying concept of citizenship, not a vehicle of national\nidentity, military dominance, or opposition to the state ; it enjoined a simple ethic\nof \u2018daily sober loyalty \u2019 to one\u2019s fellow citizens, inspired by \u2018 love for our country as\nan instrument and embodiment of truth, beauty, and kindness, or, in the largest\nand profoundest sense of the word, religion\u2019. For Bosanquet, Plato demonstrated\nconclusively the sense of country as \u2018citizen-loyalty \u2019 in Socrates\u2019s refusal to evade\nthe sentence of law passed on him at his trial.45\nThe relationship between citizenship, patriotism, nationality, and religion in\nBritish Idealist thought was thus complex and often difficult ; moreover, it varied\nacross several generations of adherents. A third-generation Idealist, the classicist,\nhistorian, and political scientist, Ernest Barker, was too late a Victorian to ex-\nperience the crisis of faith that troubled Green and others of his generation.46\n41 C.

It did so not least\nthrough the auspices of the nation after the collapse of the Roman empire and\nthe tribal society which succeeded it. For Barker, nationhood provided the basis\nof the civic ideal in its modern form by \u2018enrich[ing] and dignify[ing] human\npersonality \u2019 ; while on the face of it negating the universalist ambitions of\nChristianity, the early European nation was, nevertheless, \u2018 in eodem genere \u2019 on\naccount of its essentially spiritual, rather than biological nature.47\nHowever, for Barker, nations were created by states, not vice versa ; as he\nexplained in his Stevenson Lectures on Citizenship at Glasgow in 1925, they were\nproducts of the \u2018accumulation of tradition \u2019 in which states necessarily engaged in\nestablishing the unity of their domain.48 Fashioned by \u2018nurture \u2019 rather than\n\u2018nature \u201949 and imbued with Christian precepts, nationality had proved a force for\nunity and fluidity among mankind, and the equality of peoples. Nation-building\nhad hence become the \u2018mission\u2019 of later imperial states, providing the most\neffective basis of self-government in the face of overwhelming religious and\nlinguistic differences, as in the case of India.50 Earlier in his career he had stated\nthat the nation in this mould underlay the character of British citizenship as\n\u2018 subjecthood\u2019, or \u2018 indelible \u2019 allegiance to the sovereign, not narrow racial, tribal,\nor \u2013 when pushed too far \u2013 civic identity.51 Modern citizenship conceived thus\nwas characteristically superficial, but by that very fact, extensive in scope; by\ncontrast, the ancient model exacted a high price of exclusivity for the intimate\ncivic bonds it forged. The high price of the British empire\u2019s \u2018 inclusiveness \u2019 in\nterms of the negation of the subjecthood and hence citizenship of women upon\nmarriage to an alien in the interests of imperial unity and their ineligibility for\nnaturalization seemed unworthy of comment.52\n47 E.

Barker, The political thought of Plato and Aristotle (London, 1906), pp. 299\u2013300. The Naturalization\nAct of 1870 modified the notion of \u2018 indelible \u2019 allegiance by recognizing the naturalization of British\nsubjects elsewhere; but it left unaltered the principle of allegiance as the basis of citizenship. In 1914, it\nwas given statutory definition in the \u2018common code\u2019 enshrined in the British Nationality and Status of\nAliens Act, thereby binding together the empire in the face of the common enemy, see A. Dummett\nand A. Nichol, Subjects, citizens, aliens and others : nationality and immigration law (London, 1990) pp. 88,\n124\u20135.\n52 Barker mentioned the Naturalization Act of 1870 as modifying the principle of allegiance estab-\nlished in Calvin\u2019s case (1608) but failed to acknowledge its considerable loosening of the principle in the\ncase of married women: Political thought of Plato and Aristotle, p. 299 n. 2.

Page Baldwin, \u2018Subject to\nC I T I Z E N S H I P V E R S U S P A T R I O T I S M 161\nFor all their differences Idealist thinkers were united in a concern to detach\ncitizenship from the idea of the nation as a discrete and ineluctable unit of society.\nIn the first four decades of the twentieth century R. B. Haldane embraced a\n\u2018Sittlichkeit \u2019 of Britain, Canada, and the United States ; Barker a Federal Order\nof Europe; and, as we have seen, Bosanquet supported the League of Nations.53\nThis is despite assuming a relatively homogeneous and stable national culture and\ncharacter as the basis of civic life, broadly conceived.54 Moreover, they discussed\nnationhood in terms of national \u2018minds \u2019 (not \u2018 souls \u2019), which eschewed the\nprovidential and romantic conceptions of England often found in contemporary\npatriotic discourse. When Bosanquet declared that \u2018 there is not, and never has\nbeen, a national mind more highly endowed than the English \u2019, he supported his\nassertion with the example of \u2018 the great organized institutions which have sprung\nunaided from the brain of our wage-earning class \u2019.55 Bosanquet\u2019s resolutely intel-\nlectualist perspective on nationhood and patriotism would have failed to satisfy\nmore passionate champions of these ideals as rooted in instinctive and particu-\nlarist rather than rational and (potentially, at least) universal ties.56 Such\nadvocates were constantly on their guard against attempts to weaken the sense of\nidentity and belonging which in their view was generated uniquely by nations in\ngeneral and England in particular.\nI I I\nThe distance between the rational ideal of citizenship advocated by Bryce,\nBosanquet, and others, and the emotionally engaged ideals of patriotism and the\nnation which it sought to undermine can be gauged by the reflections on English\nlife of their near-contemporary, G. K. Chesterton. In his book, Heretics (1905),\nChesterton tore a strip off the literary giants of the late Victorian and Edwardian\nperiod \u2013 Shaw, Wells, Wilde, Moore, and Kipling \u2013 for dismissing not just\nChristian orthodoxy but orthodoxy tout court. Their immersion in the \u2018details \u2019 of\nhuman life to the neglect of the wider cosmic processes which alone made those\ndetails intelligible typified for Chesterton the grip of agnosticism on the minds of\nthe literary elite. Equally worrying was their indifference to those local and small-\nscale attachments which attained fullest expression in the nation; the nation was\nthe epicentre of ordinary lives and was crucial to the imagining of universals,\nempire: married women and the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act \u2019, Journal of British Studies,\n40 (2001), pp. 522\u201356.\n53 E.

Implicitly, Chesterton put his finger on\ntheir higher Millite and Cobdenite allegiances.59 He was also distanced from\nthem in his belief that the English nation had been progressively disenfranchised,\nnot least by the people\u2019s newly acquired citizenship in a state-centred society.60\nIn this and other ways the contours of patriotism and associated conceptions of\nthe English and British nation\/citizenry were hotly disputed in the decade or so\nbefore the First World War. Chesterton himself attracted a wide following\nthrough his many journalistic outlets, not least his weekly column, \u2018Our\nNotebook \u2019, in the Illustrated London News, which he wrote from 1905 until his death\nin 1936. The unique \u2018spirit \u2019 of each nation was the subject of his first column in\nwhich he cautioned readers against visiting only the famous sights at their holiday\ndestinations. These attractions were uniform in their grandeur, fashioned in\nsimilar tastes and styles ; by contrast, the Parisian cafe\u00b4 and the London hansom\ncab captured the essence of their respective societies and peoples. In its combi-\nnation of luxury and danger the hansom cab was a symbol of the \u2018aristocratic\nindividualism\u2019 that pervaded English life, encapsulating the \u2018courage and\ncommodiousness\u2026which runs through innumerable English institutions \u2019.61 The\naccount was clearly meant to enhance awareness of and attachment to a\ndistinctively English culture and the people who had shaped it.\nHowever, the fortunes of the active, campaigning style of Edwardian patriot-\nism were seriously affected by the First World War, after which it was widely\n57 Grainger, Patriotisms, p. 105; see also Vincent\u2019s fascinating discussion of the relationship between\nreligion and patriotism in Nationalism and particularity, pp. 127\u201333. Dismissing patriotism for its depen-\ndence upon a religious duty of self-sacrifice that redounds solely to the advantage of the state, Vincent\nfails to take account of the sense in Chesterton and others of \u2018 love of country\u2019 as a vital medium\nbetween individuals and universals regardless of the state. Nations and states are often out of sync,\neven when there is as near a congruence as possible between their boundaries.\n58 G. K.

Chesterton denied Hobson\u2019s charge that he was a\n\u2018romantic\u2019, arguing that his views corresponded with \u2018all the other people of Europe\u2019 who saw more\nclearly than Hobson that Germany was driven by the \u2018 \u2018\u2018 legend of the unconquerable man\u2019\u2019 \u2019 : The\nNation, 18 (4 Dec. 1915), p. 355.\n60 G.

For all Chesterton\u2019s radicalism, he by no means discounted entirely\nthe contribution of the aristocracy to English nationhood.\nC I T I Z E N S H I P V E R S U S P A T R I O T I S M 163\ncondemned for its alleged association with militarism and chauvinism. English\nnational consciousness was certainly much strengthened as a result of the war,\nnot least in opposition to all things German.62 Yet at the same time, the carnage\nin France seriously inhibited assertion of the claims and virtue of the English\npatria.63 The shame and discredit into which the patriotic nation was now brought\nwould have been due in no small part to its eager annexation by popular\nadvocates of citizenship with the outbreak of war. In 1914 the women\u2019s suffrage\nmovement, in particular, sought to ensure that no longer was citizenship\nsynonymous with male service to the state but universal service to the nation,\nregardless of gender. But this reconfiguration of citizenship failed to survive the\ncircumstances of war that produced it.64 The disquiet of the cultural elite in\nparticular with public displays of patriotism is evident in the refusal of W. R. Inge,\ndean of St Pauls, and the cathedral chapter to allow the Royal Society of St\nGeorge to hold further annual services on St George\u2019s Day in the cathedral after\nthe success of the event in 1923; permission only resumed with the new dean,\nW. R. Matthews, in 1935. The Society\u2019s appeal for money and new members at\nthe same time also fell on stony ground, a cause of some bitterness as its leaders\nobserved the ease with which a public normally cold to \u2018abstract ideals which\nit will not trouble to understand\u2019 succumbed to \u2018harrowing, blood-curdling,\nillustrated appeals on behalf of \u2018\u2018 starving \u2019\u2019 Russians and other potential enemies\nof our country \u2019.65\nBy contrast, the war strengthened the culture of citizenship still further, that\nis, once the patriotic heat by which it had recently been affected had been\ndrastically turned down and in some cases, off. This can be seen in the\nfoundation by a Scottish merchant and philanthropist, Sir Daniel Macaulay\nStevenson, of the annual series of lectures on Citizenship delivered to both the\nuniversity and city of Glasgow after the war. Reference has already been made to\nBarker\u2019s contribution as Lecturer in 1925\u20136.66 The first series of lectures in 1922\nwas delivered by W. H. Hadow, vice-chancellor of the University of Sheffield;\n62 See J. M. Winter, \u2018British national identity and the First World War\u2019, in S. J. D. Green and\nC.

Gullace, \u2018The blood of our sons \u2019 : men, women and the renegotiation of British citizenship during the\ngreat war (New York, 2002). As Gullace makes clear, nationhood failed to deliver the promise of the vote\nto all women; instead, age and implicitly motherhood became the determinants of female suffrage in\n1918. The prewar legacy of female citizenship was also lost, as Laura Mayhall makes clear in The\nmilitant suffrage movement, conclusion.\n65 See the correspondence between Howard Ruff, honorary secretary of the Society, and Inge in\nthe Society\u2019s journal, The English Race, 37 (Mar. 1925), pp. 6\u20137. In 1923, the sermon at the annual service\nwas delivered by the bishop of Durham, H. H. Henson. Ruff protested against the willingness of the\ndean and chapter to allow members of the Welsh church to hold their annual service in St Pauls on\nSt David\u2019s eve, a service \u2018of a distinctly racial character, including a military band, Welsh soloists\nand choir \u2019.\n66 For Barker\u2019s experience of delivering each lecture twice on the same day, first to university and\nthen to city audiences, see his Age and youth : memories of three universities and father of the man (London, 1953),\npp. 153, 194.\n164 J U L I A S T A P L E TON\nthey set forth the Idealist theory of the state as a \u2018 self-determined reality \u2019 along\nthe lines of Hadow\u2019s mentor, Sir Henry Jones, who had recently died.67\nSuch echoes of this theory grew increasingly faint in the aftermath of\nHobhouse\u2019s scathing attack upon Idealism\u2019s Germanic foundations during\nthe war, and the development of logical positivism and other anti-Idealist\nmovements in philosophy since the turn of the century.68 However, Hadow\u2019s\nlectures set the tone for the renewal of the state\u2019s primacy over the nation and\nemphasized the continued robustness of the wider ethic of civic duty \u2013 suitably\ndetached from the sinister influence of nationalistic patriotism \u2013 which\nIdealism had done so much to promote. The Oxford historian and recent\npresident of the Board of Education, H. A. L. Fisher, made this clear in a\nuniformly hostile lecture on patriotism which formed part of his Stevenson series\nin 1923. Arguing that patriotism was only serviceable to society when purged\nof every last vestige of instinctive primitive emotion, he asked his audience to\nconsider\nwhether we have not reached a stage of evolution in which it is necessary that our notions\nof patriotic duty should be revised, whether it is possible to maintain in full vigour the old\nexclusiveness of the nation, whether war has not become so great a menace to civilization\nthat greater authority should be attached to such machinery as may be contrived for\naverting it.69\nFisher\u2019s life-long liberal accomplice and intellectual mainstay of the League of\nNations Union, Gilbert Murray, would have affirmed both the possibility and\nnecessity of this movement in accordance with the twin pressures of \u2018 liberality\nand civilization\u2019 at work in human history.70 The same would hold true of\nother Edwardian \u2018Hellenists \u2019 turned committed internationalists, for example,\nA. E. Zimmern and Leonard Woolf. This stance co-existed rather uneasily with\nhigh regard for the English contribution to political culture in the west \u2013 despite\nits manifest shortcomings \u2013 especially in the worrying light of continental politics\nafter the war.71 Increasing appreciation of their own political culture dis-\ntinguished the Hellenists from those associated with the pro-Soviet Left Book\nClub, whose conceptions of citizenship as \u2018comradeship \u2019 were far more militant\n67 W.

As a result, two\ndistinct and mutually suspicious cultures remain perceptible.\nOne individual who pursued indefatigably the cause of patriotism in this way\nwas the historian and Conservative party activist, Arthur Bryant. He developed\na substantial middlebrow audience in the interwar period through pageants,\njournalism, and historical biography \u2013 much of this inspired by the historian,\nG. M. Trevelyan, one of few figures among the intellectual elite who actively\nsought to enhance English patriotism and national identity.74 Bryant\u2019s\n\u2018Greenwich Night Pageant \u2019 in 1933 which celebrated England\u2019s historic mastery\nof the sea in the shadow of the Washington Naval Treaties involved a cast of 2,000\nand ran for ten nights before audiences of 12,000. His biographies of Macaulay,\nCharles II, and Pepys consciously played the patriotic card to considerable\ncommercial and critical acclaim, as did the weekly column in the Illustrated London\nNews he inherited from Chesterton in 1936.75 Growing up before the war in the\nprecincts of Buckingham Palace where his father was a court official, he was\ninfluenced by both Chesterton and Kipling ; in the adverse climate of the interwar\nperiod he sought to reconcile their local and imperial conceptions of patriotism.76\nThe outbreak of new hostilities between differing conceptions of the relationship\nof citizenship to patriotism and their respective publics is especially apparent\nin Bryant\u2019s role in the Association for Education in Citizenship (AEC) in the\nmid-1930s.\n72 The archetype of Left Book Club thinking in this respect was John Strachey\u2019s The coming struggle for\npower (1932; London, 1934). On the Left Book Club, see S. Samuels, \u2018The Left Book Club\u2019, Journal of\nContemporary History, 1 (1966), pp. 65\u201386; and P.

However, Bryant\u2019s patriotic\nwritings for the Illustrated London News were mercilessly criticized by the Left, especially as they un-\nderpinned his support for appeasement and sympathy for Nazism and fascism in the late 1930s : see\nR.

H. Hadow a year later.78 Seeking a conservative balance to its predominantly\nliberal and progressive shade of political opinion \u2013 and one which would rec-\nommend the Association to the deputy prime minister, Stanley Baldwin \u2013 Simon\ninvited Bryant to join the executive committee.79 Foremost among the AEC\u2019s\nconcerns was the defence of democracy against the rising tide of dictatorship in\nEurope; to this end, Simon and influential associates such as William Beveridge\nbegan a campaign to introduce citizenship education in schools, universities, and\nextra-mural teaching. High on the Association\u2019s agenda was the cultivation of\nindependent judgement in citizens, together with the moral qualities necessary\nto ensure the survival of democracy; echoing earlier antipathy in Britain to in-\nculcating patriotism in the nation\u2019s youth directly, it eschewed the narrow\nteaching of \u2018civics \u2019 along with the crude political education that underlay the\nnascent authoritarian states of Europe.80 As Barker (a member of the AEC\u2019s\ncouncil) argued in a lecture of 1936, \u2018civic training has its place \u2019, but it is\n\u2018 secondary\u2019 to the end of educating \u2018whole \u2019 men \u2013 not \u2018miles pro patria [soldiers for\nthe fatherland] nor even cives pro civitate [citizens for the state] \u2019. He continued,\nIf civic training be pressed to the detriment of humanity, in the highest and finest sense of\nthat word \u2013 and that is what seems to me to be happening in Germany \u2013 it will go badly\nwith our Universities, as I think it is going badly in Germany, and it will go badly with our\nnational culture.81\nBryant would not have disagreed with this principle ; however, he did challenge\nits application in the statement of the AEC\u2019s \u2018aims\u2019. His main point of dissent\ncentred on the suggestion that citizens of Britain should identify with the\nwider world as well as their own country, and that they \u2018must be prepared to\nmake sacrifices for international goodwill and co-operation\u2019.82 Bryant\u2019s response\nemphasizes the division of the two cultures along Left\u2013Right lines under the\n77 On the connections between Simon\u2019s vision of democracy and the class prejudices that informed\nhis judgement of the Wythenshawe housing estate with which he and his wife were closely associ-\nated, see A.

At issue was his opposition to disarmament, a\ngoal which pervaded citizenship culture in many of its diverse interwar forms. It\nwas a stance which constituted a running theme in his efforts to save Britain from\nthose on the Left whom he perceived as too ready to surrender the country\u2019s\nstatus as a world power and force for international good, as much as those on\nthe Right for whom the associated \u2018glory \u2019 had become an end in itself.83 He\nsuggested that Simon remove the offending phrase. \u2018We all agree with it \u2019,\nhe declared,\nbut unfortunately the Opposition to the present Government have made, what I might call\nthe waving of the Peace Flag, a party prerogative, in rather the same way as the older\nTories made the waving of the Union Jack, so that, coupled with the [mainly Liberal and\nLabour] names on our note-paper this phrase also may suggest to some a tendency to the\nLeft.84\nBryant\u2019s influence on further drafts of the Association\u2019s \u2018aims \u2019 is unclear. His\nconcern to test the cross-party aspirations of the AEC\u2019s leadership to the limit\ncertainly paid off when he secured \u2013 against much opposition \u2013 the Conservative\nparty\u2019s adult education college at Ashridge as the venue for the first conference of\nthe Association in 1937.85 However, the difficulty of accommodating Left and\nRight on the issue of citizenship and democracy in the tense ideological climate\nof the late 1930s is evident in the aftermath of the conference proceedings. A\nshortened version of Bryant\u2019s address appeared in The Highway, the journal of\nthe Workers\u2019 Educational Association (WEA). Here, he discussed the nature of\ncitizenship in the context of democracy as practised in \u2018old England\u2019.\nEvery one of us who has English blood can be certain, whatever his social rank or birth, of\nhaving in his ancestry many humble progenitors who probably could neither read nor\nwrite, but who served their year as parish constable or some other village officer, and\nlearned thereby the hard lessons of self-government. They learned that government is not a\nmere question of making rules and giving orders, but of patience, persuasion and\ncompromise.86\nThis struck just the right note as far as the goal \u2013 pursued by the AEC and the\nWEA alike \u2013 of strengthening democratic involvement throughout all classes of\nsociety was concerned. Far less successful was Bryant\u2019s insistence on contrasting\n83 Bryant was an early opponent of disarmament : see his The spirit of conservatism (London, 1929),\npp. 168\u20139. He continued to regard Britain as the greatest force for peace and international unity after\n1945; by contrast, he held a low view of the United Nations. This is evidenced by his support for the\nSuez venture, on which see ILN, 17 Nov. 1956, p. 834, 29 Sept. 1956, p. 494, and 26 Jan. 1957, p. 130.\n84 Bryant to Simon, 6 Dec. 1934, Bryant papers, C\/28, file 1.\n85 The full conference proceedings appeared in E.

This provoked vitriolic outrage among internationalist readers of\nThe Highway, who regarded citizenship as a matter of working-class honour which\nknew no national bounds. Even the editor was embarrassed.87 The episode\nindicates that at some points relations between the discourses of patriotism\nand citizenship just before the outbreak of the Second World War were at\nbreaking-point.\nI V\nConflict on the issue of the relationship between patriotism and citizenship in\neducation along Left\u2013Right lines continued unabated during the Second World\nWar. Harold Laski \u2013 a member of the AEC\u2019s council \u2013 used one of his wartime\npolemics to castigate a report on the educational aims of Reconstruction pub-\nlished by the Conservative party in 1942. Emboldened by the threat to national\nsurvival of the previous two years, the Conservative sub-committee on education\nchaired by Sir Geoffrey Faber called for a conscious sense of nationhood to be\nimparted in schools, alongside clear religious instruction. No longer could the\ncountry afford to be suspicious of these ends, as the Spens committee on sec-\nondary education had been between 1932 and 1938 against the backdrop of Nazi\nand fascist extremism and a succession of attempts to undermine the influence of\ndenominational religion. The education sub-committee was confident that the\nfascist subordination of the individual to the state could be avoided; it was not a\ncase of the state manufacturing a national esprit de corps but of recognizing\nthe \u2018recovered fact of national solidarity \u2019 in peacetime educational policy. One\nelement of the proposal was to ensure a \u2018warmly felt understanding on [the\ncitizen\u2019s] part of his country\u2019s place and task in the world\u2019.88 At the same time, the\nreport assumed an equivalence between national consciousness and identity on\nthe one hand, and loyalty to the state on the other.\nThis unabashed identification of nationhood with statehood in the context of\nfull citizenship was a significant development in patriotic and citizenship dis-\ncourses alike. It was, however, a minority view. For Laski, the Conservative party\nreport was wholly at odds with the true ethos of citizenship \u2013 correctly perceived\nby the Spens committee \u2013 in which the state was merely an instrument of\nthe development of individual citizens ; the state was not an end in itself defined\nin spurious national terms which thinly disguised the interests of property.\nThe whole tone of the report, Laski maintained, was indicative of the \u2018counter-\nrevolution\u2019 sweeping across Britain no less than the European continent ; this was\nthe fascist attempt to re-enthrone the rule of privilege against the struggle for\n87 W.

A. Butler \u2013 who had commissioned the\nreport and an accompanying one on youth training. The Green and White\nPapers which formed the basis of the 1944 Education Act were drawn up largely\non the advice of civil servants and eschewed the strong corporate and religious\nideals that had exercised the sub-committee. As Jose\u00b4 Harris has argued, a\nmajor factor in William Beveridge\u2019s success as a wartime social reformer was\nthat \u2013 unlike Faber\u2019s committee \u2013 he reigned in the \u2018organicist \u2019 presuppositions\nof his argument, giving greater prominence to their \u2018contractualist \u2019 counter-\nparts.90 This may explain Beveridge\u2019s popularity in elite circles, ever suspicious as\nthey were of the sliding scale between \u2018organicism\u2019 and nationalism.\nIn his essay The lion and the unicorn of 1941 George Orwell famously saw things\ndifferently from Marxist intellectuals such as Laski, \u2018 severed\u2019 as they were from\nthe \u2018common culture of the country\u2019. Unlike Laski, he believed that the \u2018existing\npattern of vested interests \u2019 had developed something that was widely acclaimed in\nEnglish society : a \u2018belief in \u2018\u2018 the law\u2019\u2019 as something above the State and above\nthe individual \u2019. Orwell regarded national identity more broadly as a force which\ncut across the boundaries of class, especially with the recent expansion of the\nmiddle class, in much the same way that the progressive elite had looked to shared\ncitizenship based on a conception of the common good for the best part of half a\ncentury. Hitherto, the nation\u2019s destiny had been determined by the privileged\nfew; but now, amid the perils of wartime, it required the input of an England\n\u2018 that is only just beneath the surface, in the factories and the newspaper offices, in\nthe aeroplanes and the submarines \u2019. For Orwell at this time, socialism, citizen-\nship, and democracy were inseparable from patriotism: \u2018no real revolutionary\nhas ever been an internationalist \u2019, he defiantly remarked.91\nDuring the war Orwell\u2019s intervention strengthened the faith of other non-\nMarxist thinkers on the Left in the capacity of the mass of the English people to\nretain their political and cultural independence while identifying with, and par-\nticipating fully in, the wider nation: Tom Harrisson of the Mass Observation\nmovement and J. B. Priestley are cases in point.92 Subsequently, he was praised\nby E. M. Forster for his down-to-earth patriotism and belief in \u2018 \u2018\u2018 the people \u2019\u2019,\n89 H. J.

Orwell himself beat a hasty retreat and in 1947 embraced the idea of\na socialist \u2018United States of Europe\u2019.94 When socialism found a new, \u2018revisionist \u2019\nvoice in Anthony Crosland and Roy Jenkins, class conflict was again resolved in\ncommon citizenship, as it had been earlier in the century. But although not\ndirectly attacked, national identity and patriotism barely featured in this revival of\nan earlier discourse ; citizenship was focused instead on shared standards of living\nin conditions of rising prosperity. Recent research has shown that Crosland was\nsensitive to socialism\u2019s traditional concern with the \u2018 improvement of minds \u2019 as\nwell as material conditions, and to the happiness and psychological well-being\nthat were central to earlier conceptions of citizenship. However, he gave priority\nto a functional rather than ethical\/national view of the state on which citizenship\ndiscourse had traded \u2013 if obliquely \u2013 previously. This was accompanied by a shift\nof perspective away from the public status of citizens to the quality of their private\nlives.95\nA major influence on this development was the post-war sociologist,\nT. H.Marshall. ForMarshall, citizenship denotedmerely the equal right to certain\nbenefits and services ensured by legislation \u2013 the culmination of a movement\nwhich had extended first civil rights, then political rights, and finally social\nrights to the population as a whole. Citizenship, in its final, mature phase in\nmid-twentieth-century Britain, was a form of social integration based not on the\n\u2018 sphere of sentiment \u2019 which prevailed in the kinship system of pre-feudal\nsocieties, nor the \u2018patriotic nationalism\u2019 engendered by political reform, but a\ncommon level of \u2018material enjoyment \u2019.96 Marshall\u2019s conception of citizenship\naccorded well with the authority which the British state enjoyed in the immediate\npost-war period, eclipsing the various component nationalisms within the United\nKingdom.97 But at the same time it squeezed the culture of patriotism that had\nfound new heart and voices during the Second World War.\n93 E.

Richard Weight has contested the idea that \u2018Britain\u2019 retained its strength as\nC I T I Z E N S H I P V E R S U S P A T R I O T I S M 171\nVIn this context the British Nationality Act of 1948 met little effective opposition\namong British intellectuals of either the Right or the Left. The Act replaced the\nstatus of British subjecthood in the common code of 1914 with a new category of\nUnited Kingdom and Colonies Citizenship (CUKC).98 With the exception of\nEnoch Powell neither the Conservative nor Labour party intelligentsia rushed to\nthe defence of the embattled patria in the face of the mass immigration which\nfollowed (although the response of the Labour party, at least, was not without\nconsiderable ambiguity).99 The ensuing controversy reopened the division\nbetween intellectual and popular opinion in Britain that had developed earlier in\nthe century, although on a far more explosive scale. This casts doubt on a recent\nclaim by Kathleen Paul that public opinion could have been \u2018educated\u2019 by pol-\nitical elites into accepting mass immigration, with all the attenuation of the sense\nof cultural Englishness that this implies. Instead, she claims that policy makers\ndeliberately set about fostering a climate of public hostility towards immigrants ;\nthis would ease the path towards the \u2018racist \u2019 immigration control these leaders\nsought to take, and did take in 1962 with the passing of the Commonwealth\nImmigrants Act under R. A. Butler, now home secretary. But she underestimates\nPowell\u2019s differences with other members of the governing elite ; also, the weight of\npatriotic tradition he succeeded in tapping in Britain.100 While government\nministers, officials, and politicians may have been \u2018racist \u2019, their concern about\nmass immigration did not extend to its possible effect in weakening patriotism\nand the common loyalties and attachments that had traditionally underpinned\nnationhood in Britain. This, however, was central to Powell\u2019s attack. At the same\ntime, the extent of the departure of Powell\u2019s arguments against the scale of im-\nmigration in post-war Britain from previous conceptions of citizenship, nation-\nhood, and patriotism should not be exaggerated.\na focus of patriotic allegiance in the post-war period in Patriots : national identity in Britain, 1940\u20132000\n(London, 2002).\n98 See the illuminating recent book by R.

As Karatani has\nrecently emphasized, only Powell among anti-immigration MPs lobbied for a\nform of citizenship that was exclusive to the United Kingdom; most were con-\ncerned simply to limit immigration from the new commonwealth, not least to\nrelieve pressure on public services.101 Powell\u2019s hostility to the British empire and\ncommonwealth aside, he did so in much the same way as Bryant had defended\nEnglish identity in the 1930s and continued to do through his prolific journalism\nand stream of patriotic histories in the post-war period.102 Both men emphasized\nthat English patriotism \u2013 its latency so long a source of national strength \u2013\nwas now at an alarming discount. To Bryant\u2019s mind, at least, this was due to\nconcerted campaigns of disparagement over several generations by the intellectual\nelite, a point to which we will return in the final section of this article. Powell and\nBryant alike were committed to reigniting English national pride, if necessary\nthrough treading on increasingly raw Scottish, Welsh, and Irish nerves.103 Powell\nshared fully Bryant\u2019s romantic conception of English nationhood and stressed its\nroots in instinct rather than reason.104 Neither in Bryant\u2019s writings nor Powell\u2019s\nspeeches was there a simple association between nationalism, patriotism, and\nraison d \u2019e\u00b4tat, as the opposition of both men to Britain\u2019s entry to Europe and the\ndirigisme of post-war social democracy well illustrates.105\nAt the same time, Powell was not so distant from the assumption \u2013 albeit ta-\ncit \u2013 of the pre-war liberal elite that national homogeneity and allegiance are\nintegral to all good citizenship. Most of all he reiterated their view that citizenship\nentails a primary relationship between individuals and national polities which\n101 Karatani, Defining British citizenship, pp. 152\u20133. Support for Powell\u2019s policies \u2013 if not his inflam-\nmatory language \u2013 came from unexpected quarters, for example his fellow Wolverhampton MP and\nadmirer of Eastern Germany, Renee Short. She called for limits to immigration and the dispersal\nof fresh immigrants away from areas of high concentration: see her obituary in The Daily Telegraph,\n20 Jan. 2003.\n102 Bryant attacked Powell\u2019s dismissal of the commonwealth as \u2018humbug\u2019 in ILN, 25 Jan. 1969, p. 12.\nOn the character, sales, and reception of Bryant\u2019s post-war histories see Stapleton, Sir Arthur Bryant,\nch. 13.\n103 Bryant, ILN, 14 June 1958, p. 996, and 1 Nov. 1958, p. 738; Powell, speech to the Royal Society of\nSt George, 22 Apr. 1961, in J. Wood, ed., Freedom and reality (London, 1969), p. 257. Simon Heffer gives\nthe correct date of the speech as 1961 (Wood gives it as 1964 in Freedom and reality) in Like the Roman: the\nlife of Enoch Powell (London, 1998), p. 982. Although a member of the council of the Royal Society of St\nGeorge, it is not clear if Bryant attended the dinner at which the speech was delivered, although many\nyears later he quoted from it in ILN, May 1978, p. 31.\n104 Powell\u2019s romantic conception of English nationhood is emphasized by Heffer in Like the Roman,\npp. 153, 336\u201340; for an example of Bryant\u2019s similar conception, see The age of elegance, 1812\u20131822\n(London, 1950), p. 282.\n105 Powell\u2019s conception of the greater wisdom of the (English) people over corporate acts of\ngovernment is illustrated by a speech he gave in Bromsgrove in 1963, see J. Wood, ed., A nation not afraid\n(London, 1965), p. 26. While Bryant believed that Powell was too inflexible an advocate of laissez-faire,\nhe was likewise concerned about the adverse effects on English freedom of the increasing regulation of\nBritish society by the post-war state : see, for example, ILN, 22 May 1965, p. 12, 5 Dec. 1970, p. 12, and\n9 Jan. 1960, p. 42.\nC I T I Z E N S H I P V E R S U S P A T R I O T I S M 173\ncannot conflict with other identities and loyalties, although it might not exclude\nthem altogether.106 His conception of citizenship as rooted in individual\nallegiance explains his opposition to the Nationality Act of 1948 which grouped\ntogether nine commonwealth legislatures in the new category of CUKC, thus\nsevering the direct link between subject and sovereign.107 As he remarked in\ndebate on the second reading of the Royal Titles Bill in 1953, the duty of\nallegiance integral to citizenship overruled all \u2018 individual, local, and partial\ninterests \u2019. He certainly departed from earlier theorists in insisting that citizenship\nwas not a rational tie ; it embodied \u2018 that minimum, basic, instinctive recognition of\nbelonging to a greater whole which involves the ultimate consequence in certain\ncircumstances of self-sacrifice in the interests of the whole \u2019.108 This did not rule\nout immigration per se, although it did exclude large concentrations of immigrant\ncommunities within the wider nation.109 For Powell, the mediation of a person\u2019s\ncitizenship by sub-national identities would undermine the universal nature of\ncitizenship within societies, generating the communalism that had plagued\nIndia.110 However, in this he echoed Barker\u2019s view earlier in the century that an\noverarching nationalism was a precondition of citizenship and the only prospect\nfor democracy in India. There are also strains in Powell of the wider view of the\nIdealists that citizenship signified identity in difference: for Bosanquet, the state\nbased on citizenship gathers up at the same time as it transcends group difference\nin one \u2018unifying \u2019, integrating sovereignty.111\nThe affinities between Powell and earlier intellectuals do not of course imply\nthat they would have expressed themselves in quite the same way in the face of\nmass immigration: the Idealists and others were never challenged by events or\ncritics to examine the beliefs about nationhood which underpinned their ideal\nof \u2018common\u2019 citizenship. But the assumptions they shared with Powell are\nimportant ; arguably these commonalities outweigh more obvious differences of\npolitical style and temperament when compared with developments in citizenship\ndiscourse in the late 1980s and beyond.\nV I\nThe unity which Powell sought to forge between citizenship, patriotism, and\nEnglish identity in post-war Britain found its sharpest critics on the Left in the\nlast decade of the twentieth century, when the immigration debate had subsided.\nThis challenge to Powell was part of an attempt to make citizenship integral to a\nnew egalitarian vision based on reform of the state as much as economic power.\nCommitted to multiculturalism on the one hand and radical democracy on\nthe other, thinkers on the Left reinterpreted citizenship as the recognition of\n106 On Powell\u2019s conception of the individual basis of citizenship, see Heffer, Like the Roman, p. 450.\n107 Powell, speech in the House of Commons, 3 Mar. 1953, in Wood, ed., Freedom and reality, p. 193.\n108 Ibid., pp. 194\u20135 (my emphasis). 109 Heffer, Like the Roman, p. 474.\n110 See his unrepentent remarks on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Birmingham speech quoted\nin Heffer, Like the Roman, pp. 939\u201340. 111 Bosanquet, Philosophical theory of the state, pp. liv\u2013ix.\n174 J U L I A S T A P L E TON\ndifference not sameness and the empowerment of groups rather than the\nparticipation of individuals in a scheme of rights and duties common to all\nmembers of society.112\nTraditional, stable, inherited identities at national level cut little ice here.\nCitizenship defined in terms of personal allegiance fostered by a broad spirit of\npatriotism and tied to a unitary national culture was ruled out ab initio in favour\nof European attachments, especially.113 This entailed the jettisoning of the ideal of\ncitizenship developed by liberal intellectuals at the turn of the last century as a\n\u2018creed\u2019 and instrument of national cohesion, as much as the stronger culture of\nthe nation associated with Conservative concepts of citizenship from the 1960s to\nthe 1980s. Citizenship was now a function of composite and shifting national\nidentities. At one level the only patriotism contemplated as its handmaid was of\na specific, constitutional kind: loyalty to a constitution and set of political\nprocedures.114 This has given the recent impetus to citizenship education in\nschools focused squarely on the organization of political power ; in turn it has\nencountered considerable opposition on a range of fronts, not least its exclusion of\nwider moral and cultural perspectives centred on \u2018community \u2019 values.115 The\ndistance between Sir Henry Jones and Sir Bernard Crick, who has inspired much\nof this effort to develop a new culture of citizenship, could not be wider. This is\ndespite a continuing emphasis on universal rights determined by supra-national\nprinciples.\nSome political thinkers have expressed unease with so radical a revision of the\nconcept of citizenship. For example, David Miller has written extensively in\nthe last decade on the need for the connections between citizenship, patriotism,\nand nationalism to be maintained in at least something of the range of their\nconventional form. He argues that constitutional patriotism is an inadequate basis\nfor citizenship in complex modern societies ; instead, the stronger cement of\nnational culture is required. But the national culture he envisages is essentially\nporous, requiring the \u2018adapt[ation of] the inherited culture to make room for\nminority communities \u2019. Miller stops short of multiculturalism in insisting that\nthe civic education that is to serve such societies should contain a \u2018unitary\ncore \u2019, in addition to a \u2018periphery that is flexible to serve the needs of\nminorities \u2019.116 In recent work he defends a participatory, republican model of\ncitizenship against a less exacting liberal (and libertarian) one, but emphasizes\n112 See G.

The championing of\nhomogeneous English nationhood and the patriotic values to which it was once\nsecurely hitched is evident in recent historiography.118 It is also apparent in\nattempts to renew conservative thought by philosophers, journalists, and sub-\nstantial parts of the Conservative party itself.119 Much of this movement has\ngrown out of opposition to increasing integration with Europe; devolution and\nthe perceived shallowness and instability of multicultural visions of Britain have\nplayed their role too, as has the lowering of the tone of patriotism in football\nhooliganism and other areas of popular culture.120\nThe close affinities between this resurgence of English national consciousness\nand a similar movement a half-century and more earlier can be seen in Roger\nScruton\u2019s recent \u2018elegy \u2019 for England. Scruton sets out to explain what England\nwas before its strengths and successes were sapped by derision and repudiation\nfrom within, particularly by the intelligentsia. Like Jonathan Clark, he rejects the\nidea that England has ever been subject to a process of \u2018nation-building \u2019 ; but\nunlike Clark he emphasizes England\u2019s possession of \u2018corporate personality \u2019\nshaped by time, circumstances, and, above all, place. Chief among the factors\nwhich transformed place into \u2018home\u2019 was religion. \u2018This religion grew with the\nlanguage, which it profoundly influenced, and by which it was influenced in turn.\nIt determined the musical, architectural and storytelling traditions of the country\nat large, and was the single most importance source of the customs whereby\nEnglish society renewed itself. \u2019121 This strikes resonant chords with the central\nclaim of Bryant\u2019s histories in the 1950s and 60s that the English people developed\ninto a distinct and cohesive national whole by their conversion to, and missionary\nextension of Christianity, equated with no less a cause than civilization itself. It\nwas St Boniface, Bryant confidently asserted, who \u2018wrote the first chapter in the\nhistory of the expansion of English ideals beyond the seas \u2019.122 The sense of both\n117 D.

He was moved to write of\nSt Boniface that \u2018No Englishman\u2019s work has had a greater influence on the world. The German\nGothic cathedrals, the testimony of Luther, the Christian music of Schu\u00a8ltz and Bach all sprang from\n176 J U L I A S T A P L E TON\nScruton and Simon Heffer that England has been heavily undermined \u2013 in\nScruton\u2019s case beyond recall \u2013 by the contempt of the intellectual elite and a\nrange of publicists also has strong parallels with Bryant : concerned to rescue the\nnational pride and integrity of \u2018humble \u2019 English people from the sneers of\nBloomsbury and intellectuals on the Left, Bryant became the devoted literary\nchampion of the patriotic classes.123\nNone of the more recent defenders of Englishness, or Britishness thinly veiled\nas Englishness, eschew the language of common citizenship; indeed, the\njournalist Peter Hitchens makes powerful reference to it. He picks up the dis-\ncourse of virtue that has dropped out of the culture of citizenship in its refocusing\nof community on \u2018rights \u2019 and the recognition of diversity. But he does so in\nconnection with what was lost in the accelerated process of destruction in the late\ntwentieth century of both the culture and landscape of a determinate \u2018people \u2019,\nonce so vigilant about the habits, institutions, religion, and ideas by which they\nself-consciously defined themselves.124 Despairing of the Conservative party\u2019s\nability ever to resolve its state of chronic internal division, he has argued the case\nfor a British movement to help raise the old England-Britain, phoenix-like, from\nthe ashes.125 The spirit behind Hitchens\u2019s understanding of the term \u2018common\ncitizenship\u2019 contrasts sharply with the recent Report into the future of multi-ethnic\nBritain chaired by Bikhu Parekh. This views citizenship in terms of accommo-\ndating a welter of cultural differences in public life, and looks askance at the idea\nthat there was ever a public culture that was truly reflective of the beliefs and\noutlook of a discernible \u2018majority \u2019.126 It is a salutary reflection that few readers are\nlikely to absorb both Hitchens and Heffer on the one hand, and Parekh and\nMiller on the other, except for polemical purposes. By contrast, it is not incon-\nceivable that their early twentieth-century equivalents, for example Chesterton\nand Barker or Gilbert Murray, would have partially shared a common audience\nin forums such as The Nation and the Home University Library.\nClearly, tension between concepts of citizenship and of patriotism deeply em-\nbedded in English nationhood continues to exist, albeit at changed levels and\nthrough shifting audiences. Equally clearly, it continues to feed off the historical\nlegacy of division between intellectual opinion and that of wider publicists, to\nwhom an enhanced sense of English identity formed the basis of their sense of\ncitizenship.

Just as it\nwas invoked in the Powell years against the perceived threat of mass immigration\nand EEC membership, its recent assertion has much to do with concern for\nalleged abuse of the immigration and asylum-seeking system, the widespread\ndenigration of English national culture, and the increasing loss of British national\nsovereignty to Europe. If English national consciousness fails to develop into full-\nblown political nationalism, the visceral patriotism that has been its moving force\nhitherto remains a significant obstacle to citizenship in many of its contemporary\nforms : multicultural, European, cosmopolitan, and associationalist, to name but\na few.127 The ideal of citizenship risks becoming exclusive and ineffective if it\nloses touch with nations and the patriotism which sustains them, as is now being\nrecognized in the United States.128\n127 See R.
