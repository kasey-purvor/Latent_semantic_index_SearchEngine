He dismisses a trend of \npsychological interpretation that, to his mind, withdraws from the intellectual realm and focuses its \nattentions instead on the \u2018field of affectivity\u2019 (1974: 207). He speaks in scathing terms of such a \u2018na\u00efve \nattempt\u2019 to reduce observable aspects of human activity to \u2018inarticulate emotional drives (1974: 207), \narguing that we should instead reject any explanatory appeal to \u2018vague emotions\u2019, foregoing thus any \nattempt to derive analytic ideas from such a source. The philosopher Jean Hyppolite, Foucault\u2019s teacher \nand Lacan\u2019s frequent interlocutor, concurs, and indeed extends L\u00e9vi-Strauss\u2019s position: \u2018There is no \npure affective on the one hand, entirely engaged in the real, and the pure intellectual on the other\u2019 (in \nLacan, 1988: 293). Lacan is no less biting, as is evident in his own invective against the idea of affect as \nunmediated channel of expressivity: \nThe affective is not \u2026 a special density which would escape an intellectual accounting. It is \nnot to be found in a mythical beyond of the production of the symbol which would precede \u2026 \ndiscursive formulation (1988: 57). \nAt first glance, these comments may seem to justify Baldacchino\u2019s (2010) position that \u201c\u2018Structuralist\u201d \n\u2026 theories are at best incomplete, and at worst seriously undermined by their inattention to affect\u2019. This \nis a view that deserves reconsideration. After all, for the social anthropologist, like the psychoanalyst, \naffect would appear to be an omnipresent factor within one\u2019s field of analysis. Whether we have in \nmind the birth-rituals so famously analysed by L\u00e9vi-Strauss, or the tortured reminiscences of the \nsuffering analysand, affect cannot simply be ignored. As such, the question is not whether affect is \nignored in a way that makes a given analytical frame incomplete. The question is, rather, how affect can \nbe accommodated within such an explanatory frame in a way that does not considerably weaken it as a \nresult (i.e., resulting in a type of incompletion by way of inclusion).  \nOne response then to the call for a greater consideration of collective sentiments in the substantiation \nof national identity is to sound a precautionary note. The problem with crude appeals to feelings or \naffect in understanding identity is that virtually anything can be \u2018explained\u2019 \u2013 indeed, explained away \u2013 \nvia a loose recourse to emotion. A quick thought experiment: what aspects of social life cannot be given \nan emotional explanation? There is an incredible (pseudo)explanatory range afforded by the vocabulary \nof affect: from laziness to humility, arousal to aggression, honour to schadenfreude, what social \ninteraction cannot be made intelligible via such a style of explanation? It is precisely the attempt to \navoid such a (traditionally) individualizing and psychologizing set of values that leads a \n\u2018poststructuralist\u2019 such as Foucault (1980) to exclude such a mode of explanation from his genealogical \nframe of analysis. A variety of discursive powers, alongside the workings of various productive \nensembles of regulation and knowledge, are obscured, indeed elided, by appeals to the affectivity of key \nsocial actors (Foucault, 1980). (This is also why, contrary to Baldacchino\u2019s (2010) assertion, post-\nstructuralist approaches \u2013 certainly those of Judith Butler, Michel Foucault and Edward Said \u2013 most \ncertainly do not operate on a cognitive view of the subject: the prioritization of a discursive frame \nfollows precisely on the need to avoid the tendency to forms of psychological reductionism). \nRather than a simple error of omission then, the Structuralist and poststructuralist aversion to \nexplanation by way of affect has much to tell us about the epistemological and political failings of such \na means of accounting for social acts. The challenge here is that of how affect might be meaningfully \nfactored into forms of analysis that take seriously the role of symbolic\/discursive systems in \ndetermining facets of subjectivity, firstly, and that are wary of the de-politicizing effects of explanation \nby way of \u2018natural passions\u2019, secondly. The focus of my comments in what follows \u2013 a response to \nBaldacchino\u2019s \u2018The eidetic of belonging\u2019 \u2013 will be on qualifying and sharpening a prospective analytics \nof affect, such that we may attempt a meaningful political analysis of affect grounded within a given \nsocio-symbolic domain, and linked to a series of subjective (psychical) operations. I will begin by \npointing out a series of recurring conflations characterized by much writing on affect, and indeed, by \nBaldacchino\u2019s own paper, conflations that might be remedied by the provision of a series of basic but \nvital distinctions. \n\u00a0\nDifferentiating\u00a0affect\u00a0and\u00a0emotion\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA first distinction concerns the important difference between affect and emotion, two concepts that \nBaldacchino leaves undifferentiated in a way that undermines the conceptual strength of his analysis. \nSuch a distinction is to be found in the social constructionist literature, in the terms of a differentiation \nbetween energetic affect and the more delimited, discursive factor of emotion (Billig, 1999). It can \nequally be made via reference to psychoanalysis: \u2018[I]f affect represents the quantum of libidinal energy\u2019 \nsay Glynos and Stavrakakis (2008), \u2018we could say that emotion results from the way it gets caught up in \na network of signifiers (or \u201cideas\u201d in Freudian terms)\u2019 (2008: 267). What becomes apparent here \u2013 a \nsecond important analytical qualification in applying the category of affect \u2013 is that any properly \npsychoanalytic engagement with affect needs to be aware of the libidinal aspect of this notion, of the \nfact that such intensities involve a paradoxical libidinal enjoyment-in-excess. So, to quote Bruce Fink: \n\u2018there is a kind of basic equivalence between affect and jouissance\u2026[or] in Freud\u2019s terms, between \naffect and libido or libidinal discharge\u2019 (1997: 215).  \nBack to the emotion\/affect difference: as Stavrakakis (2007) points out: a similar distinction can be \nmade in Deleuzian terms, as it is in Massumi (1996), who views affect and emotion as belonging to \ndifferent registers. Whereas affect is considered along the lines of a bodily intensity resistant to \ndomestication, emotion entails the channelling of intensity into meaning and functionality, into the \nmechanisms and operations of narrative, \u2018semantically and semiotically forced progressions\u2019 (1996: \n221). Emotion thus represents an assimilation, a closure and containment of affect within symbolic \nmeans. The importance of the above distinction has much to do with understanding the relations \nbetween discourse and emotion on the one hand (a relation of relative commensurability), and discourse \nand affect (non-commensurability), on the other, a topic we will return to shortly. \n\u00a0\nDimensions\u00a0of\u00a0identification\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA second potential distinction that should be clarified: it remains insufficient in psychoanalytic thought \nto understand identification simply as \u2018emotional tie\u2019, as Baldacchino does in his introduction to \nFreud\u2019s understanding of group formations. True enough, Freud (1924) does utilize such a rudimentary \ndescription at points in his Group Psychology, but it is in that same work that he sets in place a series of \nconcepts that enables us, via Lacan, to differentiate between imaginary, symbolic and what we may \nguardedly refer to as extra-discursive, or \u2018real\u2019 modes of identification. Now although these registers \nare never fully separable \u2013 they are co-present, interlocking \u2013 they show up the limitation of thinking \nidentification only as \u2018emotional tie\u2019. The symbolic axis of identification entails the ego-ideal aspect \ndiscussed by Freud in Group Psychology, that is, the shared facet of a symbolic ideal (God, country, \nnation). This setting in place of a given ideal \u2013 a kind of anchoring allegiance, a symbolic fidelity \u2013 is a \ncondition of possibility for the development of a distinctive register of imaginary identifications, that is, \nego-to-other relations maintained at the level of everyday inter-subjectivity (the ideal-ego aspect). \nWhereas the first order of identifications is primary for Lacan, and a function of historical structure and \nsymbolic means (the inheritance of a name, a legacy, a place in the socio-historical order), the \nimaginary level of identification is secondary and dependent on the making and defensive maintenance \nof likeable images of ourselves derived from others. Importantly, this axis of identification entails an \neconomy of aggressive, narcissistic rivalry, as famously illustrated in Lacan\u2019s (2006) early paper on the \nmirror-stage. If we remain attuned to the ego-ideal dimension underlying various group identifications, \nwe become aware that not all such identifications represent \u2018a regression to a child-like or savage state\u2019, \nto paraphrase Baldacchino. Such ego-ideal values also represent what are amongst our most cherished \nand vaunted notions (justice, solidarity, democracy, equality, etc). \nA third mode of identification, more present in Lacan\u2019s later work, is by way of jouissance, that is, \nby means of shared excessive or transgressive libidinal enjoyments (the bonding potential of \nschadenfreude provides a nice example). We may refer to such intensities, provisionally, as \u2018extra-\ndiscursive\u2019, \u2018real\u2019 in the Lacanian sense of not being easily codified, not reducible to symbolic \nfunctioning. These affects thrill and trouble the subject in equal measure. They maintain a palpable \nbodily presence \u2013 hence Lacan\u2019s (2007) reference to the \u2018substance\u2019 of jouissance \u2013 and are never fully \nassimilated into the horizon of imaginary or discursive meaning. More than this, such affects exceed \nand\/or transgress the prescriptions of social law, thus in \u017di\u017eek\u2019s (1989) description of the obscene stain \nof enjoyment, the elusive residue of jouissance that evades explicit symbolic registration. This \ndistinction between symbolic (ego-ideal) and \u2018real\u2019 modes of identification (those of excessive libidinal \nenjoyment) enables us to introduce a degree of nuance into debates on affective affiliation. It provides \nan interesting way, for example, of recasting Orwell\u2019s (2001) distinction between \u2018patriotism\u2019 and \n\u2018nationalism\u2019 \u2013 i.e., between the non-aggressive cultural ideals that cement public life on the one hand, \nand the gratifications of excessive zeal that inevitably tend towards the aggressive, on the other \u2013 two \n\u2018emotional attitudes\u2019 that Baldacchino battles to find any significant difference between.  \n\u00a0\n\u2018Extra\u2010discursive\u2019,\u00a0not\u00a0\u2018extra\u2010symbolic\u2019\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe above set of analytical tools enables greater sophistication when it comes to understanding the \nrelation between identification and affect; it suggests we need to plot each of these intersecting \ntrajectories of identification (symbolic, imaginary and real) if we are to gain an adequate sense of \nsubjective and indeed societal, communal identifications. \u2018Affective communities\u2019 that is to say, are \nalso always imaginary communities \u2013 imaginary in the Lacanian sense, not simply \u2018imagined\u2019 in \nAnderson\u2019s (1991) famous phrase \u2013 and indeed symbolic communities, a factor which sometimes slips \nfrom prominence in the enthusiastic attempt to outline the bonding power of \u2018collective sentiments\u2019. \nWe should thus be wary of isolating the affective (indeed, the libidinal) as a priority in the analysis of \ncollective identities. We need likewise to be cautious of exaggerating the capacity of such libidinal or \naffective ties to over-ride the symbolic and imaginary bonds with which they are invariably entangled. \nThis is a potential that seems to loom large in prospective extensions of Gandhi\u2019s (2006) \u2018affective \ncommunities\u2019 thesis, one which invariably fuels the tired dualism between reason and affect that \nBaldacchino identifies. \nA crucial possible error comes to light in this respect: the implication that affective force (i.e., that of \n\u2018natural passions\u2019) bypasses or exists prior to the symbolic, that it represents a primal, pre-verbal or \narchaic means of basic attachments or aversions, and that it hence warrants distinctive analytical \nattentions potentially set aside from symbolic and imaginary axes of scrutiny. It is for this reason that I \nhave spoken of affect provisionally, as \u2018extra-discursive\u2019 not as \u2018pre-symbolic\u2019 or \u2018extra-symbolic\u2019, that \nis, as not existing beyond the range and influence of symbolic forms, even though it may of course \nescape explicit symbolic registration, or, more specifically, the codification of acceptable discursive \nforms. \nThis is a vital distinction if we are to appreciate the political complexity of various intersections of \ndiscourse, affect and emotion. An example: I may express myself in a discourse of non-racist, multi-\ncultural tolerance, I may well feel genuinely emotionally committed to such values \u2013 identifying with \nsuch ideal-ego values at a imaginary level \u2013 yet I might, nevertheless, experience a set of anxious, \naffective, bodily reactions in relation to the physical proximity of certain others. Such affective \nresponses remain conditioned by a symbolic horizon, by a (pre-reflexive) backdrop of historical values, \nmeanings, roles and similar symbolic designations.  Affective force as such is never a \u2018pure outside\u2019. \nAlthough it exceeds the \u2018gentrification\u2019 of prevailing discursive norms and eludes full symbolic \nmediation, it remains nonetheless within an imaginary and symbolic frame, within the ambit of ongoing \n(if unsuccessful) attempts to domesticate its excessive, potentially traumatic quality with meaning, \n\u2018identity\u2019, with symbolic place and value. These distinctions are, I hope, of some assistance when it \ncomes to breaking down the traditional dichotomies (reason\/emotion, identity\/affect) Baldacchino does \nso well to highlight and problematize.  \n\u00a0\nThe\u00a0confluence\u00a0of\u00a0private\u00a0and\u00a0public\u00a0passions\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow then are we to understand the relation of the symbolic to jouissance? This is a question that links \nto the consideration of contagion models of affect which, contrary to Baldacchino\u2019s apparent scepticism \nas regards metaphors of infection, maintain something of value from a psychoanalytic perspective. We \nare presented here with the challenge of accounting for how an entire nation might become enthralled \nby a type of parasitic mass irrationality, to quote Coetzee\u2019s (1991) evocative terms, transfixed by a \nsimilar affective object (for \u017di\u017eek (1993) the sublime national Thing), or a shared \u2018passionate \nattachment\u2019, to adapt Butler\u2019s (1997) celebrated phrase. It is necessary, albeit in overly brief fashion, to \nintroduce an additional analytical tool here, namely the notion of fantasy. Fantasy may be understood as \nproviding an \u2018indivisible mediator\u2019 between the symbolic and subjective domains, as the crucial link \nbetween the collective and \u2018private\u2019 channelling of affect with which Baldacchino\u2019s paper battles. \nFantasy arises in response to the \u2018Che Vuoi?\u2019 question of what I am in the terms of the socio-symbolic \nconstellation of my location, and, more importantly yet, what I imagine that this symbolic nexus (or big \nOther) of values wants from me (Lacan, 1979; \u017di\u017eek, 1997). \nA recurring existential dilemma is thus posed. This impossible requirement of definitively locating \none\u2019s self within an anonymous social structure generates an ongoing series of hypotheses. This is the \nmeans by which the subject attempts to locate themselves, to provide an answer to what the Other of the \ntrans-subjective social network wants of them (Dolar, 1998). Unconscious fantasy emerges then with \nthe overlap of a series of such postulates, as a means of co-ordinating the subject\u2019s proposed answers to \nwhat the Other of society desires and lacks, and what they as a subject lack (and indeed desire) by way \nof response (Verhaeghe, 1999). Such a synchronization of lacks, which amounts to a fantasmatic \ntransaction of desires, is testimony to the trans-individual nature of the unconscious in Lacan. This \nmeans that, while there is something irreducibly singular about an individual\u2019s fantasy, this fantasy is \nalways generated in response to the enigma of the Other of a given symbolic order, cut from the social \nfabric of given ideological and cultural location. Fantasy is thus both in one sense autonomous \u2013 it is \nthe invention of the subject, their unconscious response to the enigma of the Other\u2019s desire \u2013 and yet it \nis nevertheless contingent on the Other inasmuch as it is a working hypothesis, a fantasmatic solution \nbased on the materials provided by this Other. Hence the paradox of many fantasy objects which are \nintensely \u2018private\u2019 and yet nonetheless also clearly \u2018public\u2019, even stereotypical, in their basic \nparameters. \nSuch fantasy objects are subject to a libidinal economy, which is to say that they are objects of \npassion (indeed, of affect) and that they involve attributions of libidinal enjoyment, (who possesses it, \nthe (ill)legitimacies of such possession, considerations of how one may retrieve aspects thereof, and so \non). This is clearly a very condensed outline of the functioning of fantasy \u2013 as much as I have space for \nhere (for more see Hook, 2008) \u2013 but it does provide a tentative basis for thinking the relation between \nsymbolic context and objects of jouissance (Lacan\u2019s (2007) plus-de-jouir), a means, also, for \napprehending the surprising confluence of \u2018private\u2019 and \u2018public\u2019 in the \u201ccontagious\u201d spread of shared \naffective commitments that can bond whole communities and nations. \n\u00a0\nContinuums\u00a0of\u00a0love\u00a0and\u00a0hate,\u00a0\u2018inside\u2019\u00a0and\u00a0\u2018outside\u2019\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHaving provided a series of additional distinctions, and a number of theoretical resources useful for an \nanalytics of affect, it is now time to collapse some unwarranted oppositions. When it comes to the \ncategorical distinctions between love and hate, to stringent separations between external objects and the \nsubject\u2019s ostensibly \u2018internal\u2019 emotions \u2013 both of which Baldacchino relies on \u2013 we need tread \ncarefully. Such presumptions cannot hold in any permanent way in psychoanalysis, certainly not in \nview of Freud\u2019s notion of ambivalence and, somewhat later, Lacan\u2019s recourse to M\u00f6bius-strip topology \nas a means of demonstrating how apparent contraries might be located on a continuum. These concepts \nmake the respective contributions of disabling any definite separation of love and hate (insisting, by \ncontrast, that each is coterminous with the other, that love and hate are, as it were, co-constituents), and \nby demonstrating that a simplistic dualism of inner and outer is inadequate when it comes to \nunderstanding the processes of identification (where \u2018internal\u2019 and \u2018external\u2019 are intertwined rather than \nmutually-exclusive dimensions). \nAlthough it is true that practices of identification can be approached via the dialectical relations \napparent between an ego and its objects \u2013 the ego viewed thus as precisely the system of distortions and \nmisrecognitions that attempts to uphold such failing separations \u2013 what should be emphasized is that \nsuch subject\/object, ego\/object distinctions are never secured or fully realized. I have in mind here \nparticularly Baldacchino\u2019s emphasis on the boundary between an Innenwelt and the Umwelt, his \nassertion that \u2018in the grip of an intense anger one is likely to think of the anger in terms of statements \ninvolving an \u201cI\u201d, the idea that in \u201csubtle emotions\u201d one is  \n \nlikely to localize emotional properties in external objects. Observing another person\u2019s child \nmaking too much noise is likely to lead to the feeling that \u2018the child is irritating\u2019, while \nintense emotions focus on the ego-object, \u2018I am angry\u2019. (Baldacchino, 2010: t\/c) \n \nThe dualism in question, the inner\/outer distinction is here far too confidently asserted for \npsychoanalytic sensibilities. Practices of identification (and apparent counter-identification) should be \napproached rather within a context of failure, in which the apparent over-extension of \u2018internal\u2019 \nsubjective contents into \u2018external\u2019 objects (and vice versa) is ongoing, and where the prospect of this \nseparation is always, troubled, vexed, and ultimately, irresolvable. Intense affective rejections, the \ndesignation of a given object as external tend to exemplify what Lacan (1986) refers to as extimacy, that \nis, a relation of intimate exteriority in which that most foreign or objectionable element in the other is a \nfunction of the subject\u2019s own excluded interior. \n \nConclusion \nRather than by starting from the assumption of (an imaginary) identity and then moving on to an \ninvestigation of how it is secured against its objects, we should prioritize \u2013 focussing here on \nunconscious processes \u2013 the discord, the inchoate and fragmentary state of, in Lacan\u2019s figurative \nreference, \u2018the body-in-pieces\u2019, which desperately needs an image, an imaginary mirror-rival through \nwhom it may come to assert itself as an (imaginary) identity. Not so much a case of a \u2018plane of \nboundary formation\u2019 entrenched via designations of an irritating external object versus the defensive \nconsolidation of a separate, distinctive \u2018I\u2019\u2013 what becomes evident here is that it is the lack of boundary \nwhich is the problem. Perhaps the best illustrative example that springs to mind \u2013 particularly pertinent \nto the discussion of issues of national\/ethnic identity \u2013 is Freud\u2019s (2004) famous discussion of \u2018the \nnarcissism of minor differences\u2019. This is the idea, in short, not that two fully separable communal \nidentities are at war with one another over apparently negligible differences, but, to the contrary, that \nneither side is, in fact, properly distinct, neither has attained a separate (symbolic, imaginary) identity. It \nis for this reason \u2013 the problem of underlying lack of distinction \u2013 that the stakes are as high as they are \nwhen it comes to seemingly minor points of discriminating difference. \nFlare-ups of anger then, like those of racism and national identity, can be read not as securing ego\u2013\nobject separation, but as evidence of their failure \u2018brought home\u2019, of the fact that the ego is forever \ntrying to fashion its own separateness, distinctness, authenticity on the basis of those \u2018external\u2019 objects \nwhich, in fact, form its basis. From a Lacanian perspective \u2013 which in this respect owes much to \nHegel\u2019s master\u2013slave dialectics \u2013 \u2018aggressivity\u2019 is inevitable; it is the outcome of mechanisms of \nimaginary identification whereby ego and other disturbingly overlap one another, each occupying the \nsame position such that other is more I than I am, and such that I am more other than the other. There is \nthus a structural reason for this recurring pattern of narcissistic rivalry that underlies other\u2013ego \nrelations. No doubt such a relation entails a potent affective force, but this is not its causative factor. \nIndeed, to reduce such a situation to the analysis of affects and their functions is to mistake symptom \nfor cause. With this assertion we return to the point at which we began, namely the assertion that an \nover-prioritization of affect prevents us from adequately grasping the underlying structural (and socio-\nsymbolic and historical) constituents of a scene of affect. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nReferences\u00a0\nAnderson, B.
