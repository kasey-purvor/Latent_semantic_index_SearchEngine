Tawny owl (Strix aluco) populations \nin the UK have declined since the 1970s, when SGARs were first introduced, and \nthese compounds may have contributed to the decline in owl numbers.  Our aims were \nto conduct the first systematic survey of SGAR exposure in tawny owls and ascertain \nwhether there had been a change in the proportion of exposed birds that was \nconcurrent with the decline in the population. Liver difenacoum, bromadiolone, \nflocoumafen and brodifacoum concentrations in British tawny owls from two periods \n(1990-1993 and 2003-2005) were quantified.  In total, some 20% of birds contained \ndetectable residues of one or more SGAR.  The extent of exposure (% of birds \nexposed, magnitude of residues) to different SGARs did not change consistently \nbetween time periods.  Of the raptors analysed to date in Britain, tawny owls had the \nlowest proportion of individuals that contained detectable liver residues and so appear \nto be the least vulnerable to exposure and\/or assimilation of SGARs.   We found no \nclear evidence of an association between SGAR exposure and a decline in tawny owl \nnumbers in Britain between 1990 and 2005.  \n \n \nKey words: anticoagulant rodenticide, tawny owl, UK, liver residues, population \nchange  \n 3 \n1. Introduction \nSecond-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs) were developed and \nused following the increasingly widespread development of resistance amongst \nrodents to older (first-generation) anticoagulant rodenticides, such as warfarin (Cowan \net al., 1995).  SGARs have been in use in Britain since the mid-1970s.  Like warfarin, \nthey are derived from coumarin but are approximately 100-1000 times more acutely \ntoxic and have relatively long biological half- lives in tissues such as the liver (Parmar \net al., 1987; Huckle et al., 1988; Huckle et al., 1989; Eason et al., 1995).  Both \ncharacteristic s enhance the potential for these compounds to cause secondary \npoisoning in predators.  Rodents typically die 3-8 days after ingesting a lethal SGAR \ndose (Redfern et al., 1976) and so can be captured and eaten by a predator during this \ntime; some predators may also scavenge the carcasses of poisoned animals.  \nThere is now clear evidence that substantial proportions of the populations of \nvarious avian predators are unintentionally exposed to SGARs.  Raptors in which \nrelatively widespread exposure has been documented in Britain include the barn owl \n(Tyto alba), buzzard (Buteo buteo), red kite (Milvus milvus), and kestrel (Falco \ntinnunculus) (Newton et al., 1999; Shore et al., 2000; Shore et al., 2006).  The liver \nconcentrations in many individuals are relatively small and are thought to reflect sub-\nlethal exposures, but larger residues have been found in some individuals and SGARs \ndiagnosed as the likely cause of death (eg., Barnett et al., 2005, 2006, 2007).  The \nexposure pathways for different raptor species have not been clearly defined but red \nkites in Britain are known to scavenge common rats (Rattus norvgicus) and other \ncarrion (Carter, 2001; Pain et al., 2007).  Other raptors take few rats and are probably \nexposed by eating non-target small mammals such as wood mice (Apodemus \nsylvaticus), and bank voles (Myodes glareolus - former genus name Clethrionomys \n 4 \n(Wilson et al., 2005; Pavlinov, 2006).  Brakes & Smith (2005) demonstrated that \nalmost half of the local population of these non-target small mammals fed upon \nrodenticide baits used during rat control around farm buildings and pheasant feeders. \nThe tawny owl (Strix aluco) is a specialist nocturnal hunter of woodland \nrodents.  In broadleaf woodland habitat, tawny owls feed predominantly on bank \nvoles and Apodemus spp. although they also take greater numbers of Microtus spp in \nopen and fragmented woodlands with grassland patches (Petty, 1999).  This dietary \noverlap between tawny owls and other raptor species known to be exposed to SGARs \nmeans it is likely that tawny owls are likewise widely exposed to SGARs.   \nLong-term population monitoring has indicated that the tawny owl population \nin the UK has declined since the early 1970s and that this decline may have \naccelerated since the late 1990s (British Trust for Ornithology, 2007).  This period \ncoincides with the introduction and increasing use of SGARs in Britain and the \nassociated exposure of predatory birds and mammals to these compounds (Shore et \nal., 2003a,b).  It is therefore possible that SGARs may have contributed to the decline \nin owl numbers but, as far as we are aware, exposure of tawny owls to SGARs has not \npreviously been systematically studied in Britain or elsewhere.  Our aims in this study \nwere to determine: (i) the level of exposure of tawny owls to SGARs; (ii) whether the \nseverity of exposure has changed between 1990-3 and 2003-5, part of the period over \nwhich UK tawny owl populations declined most rapidly, and (iii) the extent of \nexposure of tawny owls compared to that of barn owls and kestrels, two other species \nknown to be widely exposed to SGARs in Britain (Newton et al., 1999; Shore et al., \n2005).   \n \n 5 \nMethods \nTawny owl carcasses were collected through the Predatory Bird Monitoring \nScheme (http:\/\/pbms.ceh.ac.uk\/), a long term UK chemical monitoring programme.  \nThe livers from 172 tawny owls were selected for analysis.  The samples were from \nbirds that had died either in the years 1990-93 or 2003-05, inclusive.  These periods \nspanned the time (1994-2002) when the UK tawny owl population underwent an \nestimated 35% reduction (British Trust for Ornithology, 2007). The birds were \ndiagnosed as having died from a variety of causes, but mostly as a result of collisions \nwith motor vehicles or other objects (55% of the sample), starvation (17%) or \nunknown trauma (10%).   \nMcDonald et al. (2000) demonstrated that 84-89% of gamekeepers use \nrodenticides during the winter and spring (December-May inclusive) compared to 37-\n45% in summer and autumn (June-November inclusive).  We therefore stratified the \nsamples of owls that were analysed so as to eliminate any potential seasonal biases in \nexposure that might be associated with seasonal variation in use (Table 1).  This \nstratification ensured that the proportion of owls found dead in the winter\/spring and  \nin the summer\/autumn did not differ significantly between the 1990-93 and 2003-05 \nsampling periods (Fisher\u2019s Exact test, P=0.352).  The age and sex of each tawny owl \nwas determined by macroscopic observation based largely upon moult pattern and \nidentification of gonads, respectively.   \nLiver concentrations of difenacoum (CAS No. 56073-07-5), bromadiolone \n(CAS No. 28772-56-7), brodifacoum (CAS No. 56073-10-0) and flocoumafen (CAS \nNo. 90035-08-8) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography \n(HPLC) following extraction methods described by (Hunter, 1985) and subsequently \nmodified by Jones, (1996).  For each liver sample, approximately 1 g of tissue was \n 6 \nweighed, ground to a homogenous paste with furnace-cleaned sand, and mixed with \nfurnace-cleaned anhydrous sodium sulphate to form a free-flowing mixture.  \nApproximately 20 ml of extract solvent (30% v\/v HPLC grade acetone in \ndichloromethane; Rathburn Chemical Co. Ltd, Walkburn, Scotland) was mixed \nthoroughly with the sulphated mixture, left to stand for one hour, and then collected \nthrough glass wool and sodium sulphate into a measuring cylinder.  The sulphated \nmass was repeatedly washed with further 20 ml aliquots of extract solvent which were \nadded to the measuring cylinder until a total of 100 ml was collected.  The extract was \nthen mixed, left to stand for approximately 12 hours, and a sub-sample (25% or 50%) \nwas reduced to zero volume; the lipid content was determined gravimetrically.   \nThe reduced extract was re-dissolved in 2-3 ml of the extract solvent and \ncleaned up using a SPE LC-alumina-N column (Supelco UK, Poole, Dorset) that had \nbeen pre-conditioned with the extraction solvent.  The re-dissolved extract was poured \non to the column which was then washed with 2 ml of acetone:dichloromethane \n(75:25) and eluted with 3 ml of 5% acetic acid in methanol.  The eluate was reduced \nto dryness by standing in a water bath under a stream of nitrogen, re-suspended in \n0.5 ml methanol, and analysed by HPLC (HP Series 1100, Agilent Technologies, \nBracknell, Berkshire) using a Hypersil ODS (C18)  250 mm x 4.6 mm  5 m column \n(Alltech Associates Applied Science, Carnforth, Lancs) at 27\u00b0C.  A 15 ml aliquot was \ninjected onto the column using 76:24 methanol:water (v\/v), supplemented with 0.25% \n(v\/v) acetic acid and 40 mM ammonium acetate, as the mobile phase pumped at 1.1 \nml min-1 isocratically.   \nRodenticides were detected by fluorescence spectrometry (HP 1100 series \nfluorescence detector) using three excitation wavelengths (310, 320 and 350 nm) and \na single emission wavelength (390 nm).  The excitation wavelength of 310 nm gave \n 7 \nthe greatest emission signal at 390 nm and was used for quantification.  The ratio the \nemission response elicited by the 320 nm wavelength to that elicited by 310 nm and \nthe ratio elicited by 350 nm to that elicited by 310 nm were both used to aid \nidentification.  Each rodenticide was separated into two isomeric peaks.  As the ratios \nof the isomers in the standard material were not known, individual isomer \nconcentrations could not be quantified.  Therefore, the detector response for each \nisomer was measured and summed to give a total response for the compound.  \nQuantification was by comparison of peak height of external standards and samples.  \nA chromatographic peak was identified as a rodenticide if the absolute retention time \nof the peak fell within the retention time window of the calibration standards, and if \nthe ratios of the signals for each excitation wavelength matched the ratios in the \ncalibration standards.   \nProcedural blanks containing reagents only were analysed to detect possible \ncontamination during the sample preparation.  Duplicate liver samples were spiked \nwith known concentrations of rodenticides and analysed to determine sample matrix \ninterference and % recovery data; average recoveries were typically between 60 and \n70%.  For each compound, the Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined from the \nlinear regression of the multilevel calibration using the equation Y=Y0 + 3Sy\/x where \nY is the LoD response, Y0 is the Y intercept and Sy\/x is the standard error of the \nregression line; LoDs for the individual compounds were 0.045, 0.013, 0.002 and \n0.050 \u00b5g\/g ww for bromadiolone, difenacoum, flocoumafen and brodifacoum, \nrespectively.  All concentration data are presented on a wet weight basis. \nThe frequency of occurrence and magnitude of liver SGAR in tawny owls \nfrom the present study was compared with that for barn owls and kestrels over similar \ntime periods.  Data for barn owls and kestrels were obtained from the long-term \n 8 \nmonitoring data collected by the PBMS (Shore et al., 2005).  When making \ncomparisons between species, the LoDs for the tawny owls were applied to the barn \nowl and kestrel data so that small differences in the LoDs between studies did not \nintroduce error into the statistical comparison of the datasets.   \n \nResults \nOf the 172 tawny owl livers analysed, 33 (19.2%) contained detectable \nconcentrations of one or more SGAR (Figure 1).  The % occurrence of individual \nrodenticides was 11.6%, 5.8%, and 4.7% for bromadiolone, difenacoum, and \nbrodifacoum, respectively.  Flocoumafen was not detected in any tawny owls.   Most \nlivers contained detectable residues of only one SGAR, but five livers contained two \nrodenticides; none contained three or more compounds.  There was no significant \ndifference in the proportion of owls with detectable SGAR residues between \nsummer\/autumn  and winter\/spring in the early 1990s, the 2003-5 sample, or for both \nsampling periods combined (Fisher\u2019s Exact Test, P>0.05 in all cases). \nThe percentage of tawny owls that had detectable liver residues of one or more \nSGARs was approximately 20% and did not differ significantly between the 1990-\n1993 and 2003-05 sampling periods (Table 2, Fishers Exact test, P=0.352).  When the \noccurrence of individual compounds was examined, there was again no clear evidence \nof changes over time.  The frequency with which difenacoum was detected was \nalmost identical in the two sampling periods.  Although the frequency of occurrence \nof brodifacoum and bromadiolone in owls in the 1990s was higher and lower, \nrespectively, than in birds from 2003-5 (Table 2), the differences were not statistically \nsignificant (Fishers Exact test, P>0.05 in both cases).  \nIn birds with detectable residues, there were no significant differences between \n 9 \nthe two sampling periods in the magnitude of liver bromadiolone (student t test, t(18) \n=1.117; P=0.279), difenacoum (t(8)=0.477; P=0.646) or sum SGAR (t(21) = 0.198; \nP=0.845) concentrations.  Only one liver from the 2003-05 tawny owl sample \ncontained detectable concentrations of brodifacoum (0.103 \u00b5g\/g wet wt) and this was \nwithin the 95% confidence interval for the brodifacoum residues measured in livers \nfrom the early 1990s.  Thus there was no evidence of any increase over time in the \namount of any individual SGAR accumulated by birds that had been exposed.  \nOverall, the geometric mean sum SGAR concentration in tawny owls was 0.125 \u00b5g\/g \nwet wt (Figure 2), equivalent on a (nano)molar basis to 0.247 nmoles\/g wet weight.   \nComparisons between species of the scale of exposure to SGARs were \nconducted for each sampling period separately.  In the early 1990s, there were \nsignificant differences between tawny owls and barn owls in the proportion of birds \nthat contained specific SGARs, but the differences were not consistent across \ncompounds (Table 2).  A higher proportion of tawny owls than barn owls had \nbrodifacoum residues in their livers (Fisher\u2019s Exact test, P<0.01) whereas the reverse \nwas true for difenacoum (P=0.051).  The proportion of birds with liver bromadiolone \nresidues was similar in both species (P=0.538).  Overall, the proportion of birds with \ndetectable residues of one or more SGAR did not differ significantly between tawny \nand barn owls (P=0.188).  In birds that died between 2003 and 2005, difenacoum was \nstill detected more frequently in barn owls than tawny owls (P=0.002), and there was \nagain no significant difference between the species in the frequency with which \nbromadiolone was detected.  Unlike in the 1990s, there was also no significant \ndifference between tawny owls and barn owls in the proportion of birds that had \ndetectable concentrations of brodifacoum.  Overall, the proportion of barn owls that \ncontained one or more SGAR rose by approximately half between the early 1990s and \n 10 \n2003-05 whereas there was no such increase for tawny owls.  \nKestrels were monitored by the PBMS for SGARs during the period 2003 to \n2005 but not in earlier years (Table 2).  The proportion of kestrels that had liver \nresidues of one or more SGAR was more approximately twice that in barn owls and \nmore than three times greater than in tawny owls (Chi Squared test: ?2(2) =39.9, \nP<0.0001).  Brodifacoum, bromadiolone and difenacoum were all detected two-three \ntimes more frequently in kestrels compared with tawny owls. \nCritical liver SGAR concentrations associated with adverse effects and \nmortality have not been defined for most raptor species.  However, the residue \nconsidered to be in the potentially lethal range for barn owl has variously been \ndescribed as > 0.1 \u00b5g\/g wet wt (Newton et al., 1998) and > 0.2 \u00b5g\/g wet wt (Newton et \nal., 1999).  This has been classified on the basis of two sets of observations.  These are \nthat barn owls diagnosed at post-mortem of having died from rodenticide poisoning \n(because they had characteristic signs of haemorrhaging from such organs as the heart, \nlungs, liver, brain and\/or subcutaneous areas) almost all had liver residues >0.1 \u00b5g\/g wet \nwt, and, secondly, that owls that had been experimentally poisoned had residues of the \nrange 0.2-1.72 \u00b5g\/g wet wt (Newton et al., 1999 for review).   If the criteria for barn \nowls were applied to the data for the tawny owls, 21 birds (12.2% of the sample) had \nliver SGAR residues (different compounds summed) that were >0.1 \u00b5g\/g wet wt, and \n10 of these birds had summed residues that were > 0.2 \u00b5g\/g wet wt.  Of these 10, nine \neither did not show signs of haemorrhaging or the haemorrhaging that was apparent \nwas related to physical trauma.  However, one tawny owl had haemorrhaging, a \nbrodifacoum liver concentration of 1.2 \u00b5g\/g wet wt., and was found close to a site \nwhere brodifacoum had been used prior to the bird being found.  Given these factors \n 11 \nand the lack of any other apparent cause of death, it is probable that this bird had been \nfatally poisoned by brodifacoum.  \n \nDiscussion \nThis study is the first large scale survey of SGARs in tawny owls and indicates \nthat, over the time periods that birds were collected, at least 19% of birds were \nexposed to SGARs.  A small number of tawny owls (27) from Scotland that died \nbetween 1987 and 2005 have also been analysed as part of the Wildlife Incident \nInvestigation Scheme (WIIS) monitoring in Scotland and five (18.5%) contained \nresidues of SGARs in their livers (Hunter unpub. data).  These findings are very \nsimilar to those of the current study, although the sampling period and analytical \nmethods differed.  Neither the proportion of tawny owls with = one liver SGAR \nresidue, nor the liver SGAR concentrations in birds with detectable residues, changed \nsignificantly between 1990-1993 and 2003-05.  This lack of change over time \ncontrasts with that observed for barn owls, but is consistent with the lack of change in \nexposure in polecats Mustela putorius during the 1990s (Shore et al., 2003b).   \nThe proportion of tawny owls exposed to SGARs appears to be lower than that \nobserved in other avian predators of small mammals, such as the barn owl and kestrel, \nand in avian scavengers such as buzzards and red kites.  The proportion of individuals \nwith liver SGARs in these species varies between 40% and 70 % (Newton et al., 1999; \nShore et al., 2000; Shore et al., 2006).  However, the frequency of occurrence of \nSGARs in tawny owls was broadly similar to that of a mammalian predator, the \nweasel Mustela nivalis that, like tawny owls, feeds predominantly on Apodemus spp. \nand voles. McDonald et al. (1998) found that one out of 10 weasels analysed \ncontained detectable liver SGAR concentrations, although three contained \n 12 \ncoumatetralyl, a first generation anticoagulant rodenticide.  Overall, the relatively low \nincidence of exposure of tawny owls to SGARs, lower than that of other species (such \nas the barn owl and buzzard) which have not declined in numbers despite a higher \nscale of exposure, suggests that SGARs are unlikely to have been a prime cause for \nthe 35% reduction in tawny owl numbers that has occurred in UK between 1994 and \n2002 (British Trust for Ornithology, 2007).  This conclusion assumes that tawny owls \nare not more sensitive to SGARs than other species; laboratory mammals can vary \nmarkedly in their sensitivity to SGARs (World Health Organisation, 1995) but almost \nnothing is known about the relative sensitivity of different raptor species.  However, \nthe lack of any rise in exposure between 1990-93 and 2003-05, despite the apparent \nacceleration in population decline since the late 1990s (British Trust for Ornithology, \n2007), also suggests that SGARs have not been a major factor driving the decline in \ntawny owl numbers in Britain since 1990.  \nGiven that tawny owls predominantly hunt in woodlands (Petty, 1999), it \nmight be assumed that their most likely route of exposure is from rodenticide use in \nand close to woodland, and so is associated with game-rearing.  Thus, SGAR exposure \nin tawny owls may particularly reflect gamekeeper use of rodenticides.  If so, the \napparent lack of change in SGAR exposure over time in tawny owls has significant \nimplications when interpreting exposure in other species, and specifically suggests that \nthe increase in exposure in barn owls over time must be due to factors other than \ngamekeeper use.  However, care is needed when assuming that contamination of \ntawny owls reflects SGAR use by gamekeepers.  The relationship between usage \npatterns and occurrence of liver residues in predators is complex and potentially \naffected by physiological, ecological and anthropomorphic factors (Shore et al., \n2003b; Shore et al., 2006).  Furthermore, in the present study, there were no seasonal \n 13 \ndifferences in the frequency and magnitude of liver SGARs in tawny owls even \nthough gamekeepers apparently vary their intensity of rodenticide use during the year \n(McDonald et al., 2000).  Given the long half- lives of SGARs in the liver, a lack of \ndetectable seasonal variation in contamination in tawny owls is not surprising, but may \nindicate that non-gamekeeping use of SGARs also contributes significantly to tawny \nowl exposure.    \n \nConclusions  \nOur data indicate that at least one fifth of tawny owls in Britain have been \nexposed to SGARs, as indicated by the presence of liver residues.  There is no \nevidence that the extent of exposure (in terms of proportion of birds exposed or \nmagnitude of residues) has changed significantly over approximately the last 15 years.  \nThese data indicate that, of the raptors analysed to date in Britain, tawny owls appear \nto be the least vulnerable to exposure and\/or assimilation of SGARs.  However, the \npresence of high liver residues in a small proportion of tawny owls suggests that \nSGARs may kill some individuals. This is also evident from the diagnosis by the WIIS \nof SGAR poisoning in a few tawny owls in some years (Barnett et al., 2005, 2007).  \nOverall, the apparent relatively low level exposure\/assimilation of SGARs, the lack of \nany large-scale mortality as detected by the WIIS, and the lack of any increase in \nexposure concurrent with the accelerated decline in numbers post-1999, leads us to \nconclude that there is no clear evidence to implicate SGARs as a major factor affecting \ntawny owls numbers in Britain between 1990 and 2005. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank all those members of the public that have submitted birds to the \n 14 \nPredatory Bird Monitoring Scheme, which is funded by the Centre for Ecology & \nHydrology, the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, the Environment Agency, and \nthe Campaign for Responsible Rodenticide Use (CRRU).   \n \n 15 \nReferences \n \n \nBarnett EA, Fletcher MR, Hunter K, Sharp EA.
