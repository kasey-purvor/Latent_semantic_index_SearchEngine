The depth of investigation is discussed in terms of \nboth theory and practical measurements and the response of the technique to a variety of \nsynthetic 'structures' is presented.  \n \nWe demonstrate the potential of the technique for rapid electrical imaging of core and present a \nwhole core image of a dipping layer with azimuthal discrimination at a resolution of the order of \n10 mm. Consequently, the technique could be used to investigate different depths within the \ncore, in agreement with theoretical predictions.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nElectrical resistivity is used as a primary method for reservoir characterisation, being related to \nporosity, porosity style and the nature of the fluids in the pore space (e.g. oil, water, or gas). \nWhere sediment is fully saturated the resistivity changes will reflect changes in porosity and \nfabric, whereas changes in pore fluids may be dominant over these.  \n \n Traditionally, electrical resistivity measurements on core have used the galvanic approach where \nmetal electrodes are attached to plugs of rock sub-sampled from full or half-round core. These \ngalvanic resistivity measurements on core have benefits of potentially very fine resolving power \nand an independent  depth of investigation (e.g. Jackson et al., 1995; Lovell et al., 1995). Their \ndisadvantages stem from the need for direct electrical contact between electrodes and core \nsample, and electrode polarization and contamination for example.   \n \nWhile cross-contamination between soft sediment cores is major issue in ocean research (e.g. in \nBOSCOR Meeting\/Non-contact paper\/Jackson et al \n \n 3\nthe Ocean Drilling Program), non-contact resistivity imaging at the well site was identified as \nneeded in a study of research and development requirements in core analysis in the Petroleum \nIndustry (HMSO\/Department of Energy, 1991).  \n \nBOSCOR Meeting\/Non-contact paper\/Jackson et al \n \n 4\nELECTRICAL INDUCTION LOGGING OF CORE  \n \nFollowing the successful introduction of galvanic electrical resistivity logging of boreholes in the \n1930\u2019s induction logging became established in the 1950\u2019s (e.g. Doll, 1949), as it was capable of \noperation in oil-based muds. Non-contact EM conductivity measurement of the terrestrial land \nsurface was introduced in the 1980\u2019s (McNeil, 1980), proving to be a rapid highly successful \nmapping technique. Moving a pair of coils at fixed separation over the surface of interest, we \nhave adopted McNeil\u2019s approach to non-contact resistivity measurements on core samples. The \nmethod is summarized in Figures 1 and 2 where the cumulative response curves and the \nassociated two different coil orientations can be seen. For a transmitter-receiver coil pair placed \nat the surface of a conducting \u2018earth\u2019, if the frequency is low enough, the traditional \u2018skin depth\u2019 \n(the tendency of alternating current to flow near the surface of a conductor), becomes large \ncompared to the coil spacing, and the mutual induction of the secondary currents can be \nneglected (McNeil, 1979), in what is called the \u2018low induction number\u2019 criterion. Here the \nmagnetic field, caused by the electric currents induced in the \u2018earth\u2019 is 90 degrees out of phase \nwith the primary magnetic field exciting the transmitter, and is inversely proportional to the \nground resistivity. Additionally, the current flowing in each layer within a horizontally layered \nearth would be independent of one another, while the contribution of each layer to the \nmeasurement is the inverse of the product of the layer\u2019s conductivity and the difference in \ncumulative response function between its upper and lower bounds (Figure 2).  \n \nDesign \n \nTo improve resolution, pairs of small coils were developed for use at low induction numbers near \nthe surface of core samples having the plane of the coils horizontal (vertical magnetic dipoles) as \nshown in Figure 2. Initially the sensors consisted of two 15 mm diameter coils placed 42 mm \napart within transparent plastic holders (Figure 3). Subsequently, stability was increased using an \nadditional pair of \u2018control\u2019 coils, situated 200 mm away responding to air alone (Figure 4). This \nsimple device, unavailable for downhole or conventional terrestrial prospecting, has enabled both \nthe sensitivity and range of the core measurements to be substantially improved. Figure 5 \nillustrates the relationship between the signals obtained at a transmitter and received coil-pair, \nshowing the 90 degree phase shift and the greater noise on the far lower amplitude received \nsignal.  \n \nCalibration \n \nThe performance of the system is verified in Figure 6 where the output measurements can be \nseen to be directly proportionately to fluid conductivity. Similarly this non-contact EM method is \ncompared with both traditional galvanic measurements and published values for NaCl solutions \nof differing concentrations (Figure 7). These results confirm the performance of both the new \nnon-contact method and conventional four-electrode galvanic measurements. \n \nThe performance of the non-contact resistivity approach for core measurements was investigated \nusing a suite of synthetic samples of known geometry and properties. Each synthetic core was \nconstructed inside a thick walled (10 mm) 90mm diameter (ID) perspex tube. Using the vertical \ndipole arrangement of coils (Figure 1), the measurement was relatively insensitive to the \npresence of the perspex wall. The response to simulated resistive layers within a uniform host-\nBOSCOR Meeting\/Non-contact paper\/Jackson et al \n \n 5\nrock is shown in Figure 8, where the core is moved past the coil pair. \nThis ability to map structure within a core is illustrated further in Figures 9 and 10 where a \nwedge and thin dipping layer are presented. Figure 9 shows an electrical image (made by \nmapping successive profiles along the core) for a resistive saturated sandstone surrounded by \npore fluid. Note the sandstone core is cut with a sloping or dipping face to the left and a \nperpendicular face to the right. In Figure 10 a dipping conductive fracture within a saturated \nsandstone formation is simulated. The dipping layer case, being 15 mm thick, demonstrates the \npotential of the method to assess structure almost three times finer than the coil separation.  \n  \nDepth of Investigation \n \nSeparate to this investigation of the ability of the method to image features along the core, we \ninvestigated the depth of penetration of the signal into the core by the non-contact measurement. \nThis is illustrated in Figure 11 for a range of material resistivities. Here a 100 mm diameter \nplastic tube, sealed at one end, with the sensor coil pair situated beneath, was filled with varying \ndepths of water for a range of fluid resistivities. The results show 50% of the contribution to the \nmeasurement comes from the closest 10mm of material, demonstrating the technique will \nrespond to structure within the core rather than averaging values over a given depth interval.  \n \nCase examples \n \nApplication of the non-contacting technique in scientific studies has recently been widely \nenabled through the integration of the non-contact methodology described here into the \nGEOTEK Multi Sensor Core Logger (MSCL). Two different environments are described here. \nFigure 12 shows resistivity formation factors acquired on core recovered off the Moroccan coast \nat about 31\u00b0N\/10\u00b0W, water depth 1072m. When dealing with discontinuous core sections it is \nimportant to be aware of end effects; here in this example this results in a significant loss of data \nat each section limit due to a (small) air gap that was unavoidable between two sections \nmeasured successively. \n \nA second application is shown in Figure 13 and Figure 14. Both samples are from the upper \nslope west of the Hebrides in areas of seabed with structured sidescan sonar backscatter \nindicating possible Holocene slope instability. Figure 13 shows core samples made \npredominantly of mud (57-72% particles < 2 microns) with unconfined shear strengths averaging \napproximately 4kpa.  A peak of magnetic susceptibility just below approximately 2.5m is \nthought to originate from a thin layer of magnetite-rich rock granules. Figure 14 is mud \n(approximately 65% particles <2microns) with average unconfined shear strengths of \napproximately 10kpa in the upper part. This overlies a very irregular log response associated \nwith a mud, which on the basis of the sidescan image is possibly a debris flow (approximate \naverage 46% particles <2microns). This lower interval appears to be slightly more cohesive with \nunconfined shear strengths averaging approximately 14kpa. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nWe have described a new non-contact method for the rapid electrical logging of core. \nExperimental results on synthetic core and on saline solutions demonstrate the success of this \napproach, while results for core from offshore Morocco and offshore NW Europe show the \nBOSCOR Meeting\/Non-contact paper\/Jackson et al \n \n 6\napplicability in ocean floor studies of saturated sediments. Wider application to hydrocarbon \ncore has yet to be demonstrated but where conductive paths exist in the rock, it may yield useful \nadditional core logs on which to base further sampling and special core analysis.  \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nThe development of the non-contact resistivity method for use on core samples arose from a \nrecommendation form the Department of Energy study of Study of Research and Development \nRequirements in Core Analysis (HMSO, 1991).
