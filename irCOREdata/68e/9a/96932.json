Reaction-diffusion mechanisms form perhaps the most \nwidely studied class of models for biological pattern formation, and have been \nsuccessfully applied to a wide range of developmental and ecological system s.\nAll such models are ultimately based on Turing's (1952) seminal work on \"the \nchemical basis of morphogenesis\", and more recent applications to embryo- \ngenesis utilize Wolpert's (1969, 1981) concept of positional information. \nWolpert suggested that cells are pre-programmed to differentiate according to \nlocal concentrations of chemical morphogens, thereby translating a con- \ntinuous chemical pre-pattern into a discrete pattern of different cell types. \nThere is now considerable literature on applications of this idea to a wide range \nof developmental problems (see the references in the books by Meinhardt, \n1982; Murray, 1989). Segel and Jackson (1972) first proposed iffusion driven \ninstability as an explanation for the spatial heterogeneity that is sometimes \nobserved in predator-prey interactions. Again, the idea that dispersal could- \ngive rise to instabilities and thence to spatial pattern was built on by a number \nof authors (see Okubo, 1980, for review). \nOne feature common to the vast majority of these applications of diffusion \ndriven instability is that they are considered in the context of a homogeneous \nenvironment, so that the model parameter values are constant across the \n365 \n366 D.L. BENSON et al. \ndomain. However, environmental variation may be an important regulator in \nsome biological systems. The influence of the local topography on population \ndispersal has long been recognized, and a number of authors have studied this \nusing spatially discrete models (see, for example, Levin 1976, 1986). In \ndevelopmental biology, considerations of scale invariance have led to the \nsuggestion that morphogen diffusivity might be controlled by the concentra- \ntion of a non-reacting regulatory chemical, which could result in a spatial \nvariation (Othmer and Pate, 1980; Pate and Othmer, 1984; Hunding and \nSorenson, 1988). \nIn this paper we present a mathematical nalysis of the spatial patterns \nimplied by reaction-diffusion mechanisms in which the dispersal rate of one \nspecies varies in a simple stepwise manner across the domain. We consider \napplications of our results in both embryology and ecology. Despite the \nextensive mathematical literature on reaction-diffusion equations (for review, \nsee the books by Britton, 1986; Murray, 1989), we are not aware of previous \nattempts to analyse patterns in this case. Auchmuty and Nicolis (1975) analyse \na system in which the reaction terms depend explicitly on space, and \ninvestigations of the effects of spatial varying parameters in ecological \nreaction-diffusion models have focused on carrying capacities and other \nparameters in the reaction terms (Pacala and Roughgarden, 1982; Shigesada, \n1984; Cantrell and Cosner, 1991). \n2. Conditions for Diffusion Driven Instability. \nHomogeneous environment. We begin by summarizing the conditions for \ndiffusion driven instability in a homogeneous environment; a detailed \nderivation of the results can be found, for example, in the book by Murray \n~(1989). We consider a two species reaction diffusion system in one space \ndimension, with the form: \n~U ~2U \nOt - Du ~zxz + f(u, v) (la) \nOV O2V \ngt = D~ ~x 2 + g(u, v), (lb) \nwhere D u and D o are positive constants, and where the reaction termsfand g\nare such that a non-zero homogeneous steady state (u o, Vo) exists. For \nsimplicity, we consider these quations on a finite domain, [0, 1] say, with zero \nflux boundary conditions. This system exhibits diffusion driven instability if the \nhomogeneous teady state (u o, Vo) is stable to spatially homogeneous \nperturbations, but unstable to some inhomogeneous perturbations. The \nDIFFUSION DRIVEN INSTABILITY 367 \nconditions for this phenomenon, and thus for the generation of spatial pattern, \nare: \na + d < 0 (2a) \nad > bc (2b) \nD va + Dud > 0 (2c) \n(Doa + Dud) 2 > 4D uD~(ad -- bc ), (2d) \nwhere \n0~ Og Og \na=~Ju(.o,vo ) b=~v(.o,vo ) C=~uU\u00a2.o,vo) d=ffV\u00a2.o,vo ) (3) \nThe set of parameter values satisfying these conditions is known as the Turing \nspace. One important implication of (2a, b, c) is that: \nad<O and bc<O, (4) \nso that within an arbitrary relabelling of species, the kinetic matrix has one of \ntwo forms: \n(++) \npure activator-inhibitor model \n(+ +) \ncross activator-inhibitor model. \nIn the former case, solutions for the two species will be in phase, while in the \nlatter case they will be out of phase, at least in the vicinity of a primary \nbifurcation point (Dillon et al., 1992). \nInhomogeneous environment. We now amend the standard system (1) by \nreplacing the dispersal term in (lb) by (O\/Ox) [D(x)Ov\/~x], where: \nD(x)={D- ,  0<~x<~ \nD +, ~<x~<l (5) \nand ~e (0, 1); we assume that D-  <D +. Thus the domain is composed of two \nparts, with the diffusion coefficient of u the same, but that of v different, on the \ntwo parts. This represents he simplest possible case of environmental variation \nin diffusivity, and our analysis in this simple case provides an understanding of \nthe ~ay in which environmental inhomogeneities can modulate the pattern- \nforming capabilities of reaction-diffusion systems. Moreover, as discussed \n368 D.L.  BENSON eta\/. \nbelow, numerical solutions of models with more realistic forms for D(x) reveal \nqualitatively similar patterns to those predicted when D(x) is a step function. \nFor this inhomogeneous model, we ask: what are the amended conditions \nfor diffusion driven instability, and what is the form of the patterns generated \nwhen these conditions are satisfied? The requirements for (u o, Vo) to be stable \nto spatially homogeneous perturbations remain (2a) and (2b). To derive the \nanalogues of (2c) and (2d), we linearize the model about the steady state \n(u o , Vo), and look for separable solutions of this linearized system, in the form \nu - u o = eZtX,(x), v - v o = e~tX~(x). Substituting these into the linearized model \ngives coupled ordinary differential equations for X, and X~: \nJ(~ + (a - 2)X,, + bX, = 0 (6a) \n[D(x)X',]' + cXu + (d - 2)X~ = O; (6b) \nhere prime denotes d\/dx. We consider these equations eparately on [0, ~) and \n(~, 1]. In the former case, adding (6a) to s - \/D-  times (6b) gives: \n\u2022 ( JC .+s-L)\"+ D_ X.+ [a-2+cs-\/D-] X, =0. (7) \nWe choose s such that: \nb + (d-  2)s -\/D - \na - -2+cs - \/D-  \n--s , (8) \n.which is a quadratic equation for s- ,  with roots s(  and s 2, say. Equation (7) \nthen becomes a single equation in X, + s~-X~, forj  = 1, 2, with general solution \nCj cos (e \/x )+Dj  sin(afx). Here Cj and Dj are constants of integration, and \not f=[a -2+cs f \/D- ]  1\/2, j= l ,2 .  We therefore have two simultaneous \nequations for Xu(x ) and Xv(x) in [0, ~). Solving these and applying zero flux \nboundary conditions at x = 0 gives: \n1 [-(F=+s(Fv)s z- (F,+s;F,)s[ cos(e~x)] (9a) \nX.(x)- (s ; -s?) l  cos(e?x) cos( e;) \n1 F(I] + s2- V~) (F.+ s(F~) J \nXv(x)- ( s f - - s ( )  [_ cos(~0~2) cos(e2x ) c\u00b0s(~el)  cos(a\/x) (9b) \non [0, ~), where F. = X.(~), Fv = X.(~ ). In (9a,b), we are assuming that s(  #s  2- \nDIFFUSION DRIVEN INSTABIL ITY  369 \nand cos(4~f ) \u00a2 0 forj  = 1, 2; we discuss these assumptions below. Similarly, on \n(4, 1]: \n1 F(r .+sfro)s ;  , +,. \n(r .+s;ro)~? ] \n~i -~)  cos(a;(1-x)) (9c) \n[ (F, ,+VR) \nxv(x) - (~2 _ s;) LCo~G--~) oos(~; (1 - x)) \n(F\"+ s+F') cos(a~-(1-xl ) ] .  (9d) \ncos((1 - ~)~i ~) \nBy design, this solution is continuous at x = 4, but we also require it to satisfy \ncontinuity of flux, that is: \nlim X',(x) = lim X',(x) lim D-X ' , (x )  = lim D +Xv(x): (10) \nx~-  x--,~ + x -*~-  x~ + \nSubstituting the solutions (9) into (10) gives: \ne(2)F, + O(2)F, = 0 \nR(~)r. + s(~)r~ = 0, \nwhere: \nP(2 ) = (s? T 2 -- s 2 T?  )\/(s 2 -- s ;  ) + (s~ T ;  -- s ;  T~ ) \/ (s ;  - s~ ) \nQ(2) = s~ s 2 ( T f  - T~ )\/(s i - s~ ) + s~ s ;  ( T~ -- r~  )\/(s~ - s~ ) \nR(2) = D - ( r Z -- T 2- )\/(s 2 -- s i ) + D + ( T~ -- r~  ) \/ (s ;  - s~ ) \nS(2 ) = D - (s~ r~ - s 2 T 2 )\/(s 2 - s~ ) + D + (s~ r~ -- s~ T2 + )\/(s~ - s~ ) \nand Tf=af  tan(~af),  T J=af  tan( (1 -4 )a f ) ,  for j= l ,  2. Now from (9), \nT, = F, = 0 implies that X,(x)=-X,(x)=-0.  Thus for non-trivial X, and X,, we \nrequire: \nF (2 ) -  P(2)S(2) -  Q(2)R(2) = 0. (11) \nThis is the dispersion relation, relating growth rates of instabilities to the model \nparameter values. The model system will exhibit diffusion driven instability \nprovided (2a) and (2b) are satisfied, and provided this dispersion relation has a \nsolution with positive real part. Our derivation of (11) assumes that cos(4a~-), \nc'os(4a 2 ), cos((1 -- 4)~ 1 ), cos((1 -- ~)a + ) and (s + - s~- ) are all non-zero. Similar \nanalyses can be done in the cases when one or more of these is zero, but the \n370 D.L.  BENSON et al. \nsolutions for u and v cannot in general satisfy continuity of flux at x = 4- One \nnotable exception to this, however, is the homogeneous case D = D +. The \nsolutions of the dispersion relation given by the standard analysis (see above \nand Murray, 1989) satisfy 0~f = nrc for some ne [1, 2, 3 , . . .}  and either j = 1 or \nj=2 .  Thus with 4= 1\/2, half of the eigenvalues 2 are not roots of (11), since \ncos(nrc\/2) = 0 when n is even. These roots can be retrieved, however, either by \ninvestigating the above special cases, or by taking more general values of 4: the \nvalue of ~ is irrelevant when D - = D + \nIn general the roots of the dispersion relation (11) are complex. However, \nwhen the diffusion coefficients are spatially homogeneous, all solutions of the \ndispersion relation with non-zero imaginary parts have negative real parts. \nMoreover, our numerical solutions of the partial differential equation system in \nthe case of a step function diffusivity have never revealed time periodic \ninstabilities, which would be implied by Im(2)# 0. Therefore we assume that \nthe solutions of (11) which have positive real part are real and we restrict \nattention to real values of 2. Although (11) cannot be solved analytically, it is \namenable to simple numerical solution in this case, since when 2~,  \nstraightforward algebra shows that F(2) is also real valued. A typical functional \nform ofF(2) is illustrated in Fig. 1. Fhas infinities at values of 2 for which one of \ncos(~0~;), cos(~2) ,  cos((1-~)0~-), cos((1-~)0~2 +) or (s~-s2)is zero; as \nexplained above, our linear solutions are not valid for these values of 2. It is not \nimmediately clear from (11) that conditions (4) must hold for diffusion driven \ninstability to be possible in the amended system. However, numerical solutions \nof (11) suggest that, as expected intuitively, these conditions are still necessary \nfor diffusion driven instability. Thus the classification of models exhibiting \ndiffusion driven instability into pure and cross activator-inhibitor models \nremains valid. \n3. Applications. \nThe Schnackenberg model for morphogenesis. One of the most widely \nstudied reaction diffusion models for Turing-type pattern formation in \nembryogenesis is that proposed by Schnackenberg (1979), which is based on a \nhypothetical mechanism consisting of a series of trimolecular autocatalytic \nreactions involving two chemicals. When appropriately nondimensionalized in \none space dimension with a step function diffusion coefficient for the inhibitor \nchemical, the model equations are: \n(~\/,\/ (~2L\/ \n0t - 0x 2 \"q- 7(A-u+u2v)  (12a) \n~v c9 [D(x) 6~v ] ~3t -- 6~x ~xx + v(B--u2v) (12b) \nDIFFUSION DRIVEN INSTABILITY 371 \n+ 1- \no 0 \n\/ \n-100  \n\\k__ \n100 200 \nFigure 1. A typical functional form of the dispersion relation F()0, defined in (11), \nfor the Schnackenberg system (12), with parameter values in the Turing space. For \nclarity, we plot sign (F)-log(1 +IF]) on the vertical axis, to better illustrate the \ninfinities of F(2). The parameter values are 7= 1040, A=0.1, B=0.9, D =7, \nD+=12, 4=0.5. In this particular case there are two unstable modes, with \napproximate linear growth rates 2 = 34.9 and 2 = 104_4. For all parameter values, a\nstraightforward calculation shows that F(2)= 0(2) as 2--,oe. \non ~<x ~< 1. Here A and B are positive constants and 7 is a scale parameter \nproportional to the dimensional length of the domain; the step function D(x) is \ndefined in (5). This is a cross activator-inhibitor model. Again, for simplicity \nwe consider only zero flux boundary conditions. This system has a single \nhomogeneous steady state, at u=A +B, v=B\/(A + B) 2, which is stable to \nhomogeneous perturbations provided (A+B)  a>B-A;  all the numerical \nresults we will show use parameter values satisfying this condition. \nThe dispersion relation (11) enables us to determine numerically the Turing \nspace for (12). As expected intuitively, whenever D + >D-  >Oer i t  , the model \nexhibits diffusion driven instability; here Dcrit is the value that a spatially \nhomogeneous diffusion coefficient must exceed for diffusion driven instability. \nWhen D <Dcrit, however, diffusion driven instability requires D + to be \ngreater than a critical value, De+it say, which depends on A, B, 7 and D - The \nvariation of D+it with D - is illustrated in Fig. 2 for typical values of A, B and 7: \nas expected, De+it approaches D~rit from above as D-  approaches D, i  t from \nbelow. These calculated values compare very well with results from numerical \nsimulations using the full partial differential equation model. The form of these \nconditions depends crucially on a being positive, so that d is negative. If these \nsigns are reversed, all the inequalities are reversed, and this corresponds to \ndenoting the activator and inhibitor chemicals, respectively, by v and u rather \nthan u and v. \n372 D. L.

The diffusion \ncoefficient of the species u is constant throughout the domain, while that of v has the \nconstant value D - on [0, 4) and D + on (4, 1]. For parameters in region I, diffusion \ndriven instability gives rise to type A isolated patterns (see text for details). In region \nII patterns are either type B isolated patterns or (for larger values of D +) \nnon-isolated patterns; the division between these types is arbitrary. In region III, \nD + <D+it and thus the system does not exhibat diffusion driven instability. In the \nshaded region, D-  > D +; this is therefore not a vahd region of parameter space. In \nboth of the regions I and II, the solution is in category (bi) on (4, 1], while on [0, ~) \nthe solution is in category (bii) in region I and in category (a) or (bi) in region II. The \nother parameter values used in the figure are 7= 1040, 4=0.5, A=0.1, B=0_9. \nThese are the same parameters as those used in Fig. 3, and we indicate the position \nin this parameter domain of the solutions hown in the three parts of Fig. 3. For \nclarity, we show only the portion 7 ~<D + ~< 10.5 of the D +-axis, but our conclusions \nare valid for a wide range of values of D+. To better illustrate the interesting \nbehaviour when D is small, we use a magnified linear horizontal scale on \n0~<D 40.5. \nIn the vicinity of a primary bifurcation point with a simple spatial eigenvalue, \nthe key qualitative features of the patterns given by the full non-linear system \nare generally captured by the separable solution of the model when linearized \nabout the homogeneous steady state, with the eigenvalue 2 taken as the largest \nreal solution of the dispersion relation. Now in the course of deriving the \ndispersion relation (11), we have obtained the separable solutions of the \nlinearized system corresponding to (12), and the spatial part of these solutions \nis given in (9). As in the homogeneous case, with 2 as the largest real solution of \nthe dispersion relation (11), the linear solution captures the key qualitative \nfeatures of the non-linear patterns predicted by our model (12), for a wide range \nof parameter values (Fig. 3). \nA major difference between the patterns illustrated in Fig. 3 and those \nfamiliar from spatially homogeneous reaction diffusion equations, is that for \nsome parameter values, the pattern is isolated in one part of the domain. Now \nfor given values of all the parameters, the concept of \"isolated pattern\" is not \nreally meaningful, since by appropriately subdividing the domain, any pattern \ncan be said to be restricted to particular subdomains. However, the key aspect \nof our model is that pattern remains isolated in a specific subdomain as the \n[ Linear Solution I (a) [ PDE solution l \n,,'~, i 1.05 \n\u2022 ,11 ,1  \n,o li, il J'I I I \" . ,oo -o o ~. : .  ~.. \n0.8 ' i 0.8 ' \" \n\"\/ k : \\ \/  ogs v k i l l  \u00b088 \n0.4 \\ \/~  -' 0.6 '\\'\/ '~ \nv \no.'z o,'4 o.'e o,'8 ~.o o.'z o.'4 0.'8 o.'8 1.o \nX X \n1.6 \/ \\  : , , \n\u2022 ~, . . . . . . . . . . .  ,~, ~ 1.0 0.9  \no.8 \",L\" ', ~ -o.8 \ni ', .' o81 \"~..'.\\ \/ i. \/1~o8 \no.4 1 ,, ~'\" \"0.6 _ _  \no.'z o.'4 0.'6 0.'8 1.0 0.2 0.4 0.8 0.8 1.0 \nX X \nI Linear So lut ion  1 (e) [ PDE so lu t ion  I \n! \/ ' ~ 1.1 f '  \n. . . .  , m t . 0 k I \" \/ ' ' 1.z .  ,\\ ,I \\ \/ ', i ' , ' \n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  ~ ~ x.o . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  0 .90  =' \n= ,, > = ,, > \n0 .8  ' 0 .8  \n.:, 0.9 -  , 0 .85  \n0.4 \u2022 , 0.6  : \n0.'2 0.'4 0.'6 0.8 1.0 0.'2 0,'4 0,'6 0.'8 i,O \nX X \nFigure 3.

In each case the \nlinear solution captures the qualitative behaviour of the full non-linear pattern. \nNote that the patterns for u and v are out of phase, since the Schnackenberg system \nis a cross activator-inhibitor model. The full non-linear model was solved \nnumerically using the method of lines and Gear's method (Gear, 1971) from initial \nconditions of small random perturbations about the homogeneous steady state, \nuntil a new inhomogeneous steady state was reached. The non-linear pattern thus \nobtained is independent of the initial perturbations (within a change in sign of both \nu -u  o and v -%)  for all values of D \u00f7 used in the figure. However for sufficiently \nlarge D \u00f7, there are several unstable modes with similar growth rates, and different \ninitial conditions result in qualitatively different patterns.

As the scale parameter ? varies (but is large enough that diffusion \ndriven instability occurs), the model solution is always monotonic in \none part of the domain, but is in general oscillatory in space \nelsewhere. \nType B. As ? varies such that diffusion driven instability occurs, the model \nsolution is in general oscillatory in space throughout the domain, but \nwith much greater amplitude in one part of the domain than \nelsewhere. \nWe now use the linear solution (9) to drive necessary and sufficient conditions \nfor the existence of type A isolated patterns. We begin by investigating the \nforms of these solutions:without loss of generality we consider only the region \n[0, ~). There are then two cases to consider. \n(a) s 1 , s 2 complex conjugates. In this case, a i- and a 2 are complex \nconjugates, ay aft _+ ia[. Note that the assumption s[ # sf implies that a !  # 0. \nMoreover, straightforward algebra shows that s 2 (F, + s 1F.)\/  \n[(sf-s[)cos(~a~)] and s[(F,+sfF~)\/[(s[-s2)cos(~a\u00a3)], and also (F,+ \ns[Fv)\/(s[-sz)cos(~a[)] and (F,+s2F~)\/[(s2-sl)cos(~2)] are both \ncomplex conjugate pairs, say qu + iv, and % _+ iv, respectively. In this notation, \n(ga) is: \nX u = (t\/. + iv.)cos[(aff + ia l- )x] + (q. - iv.)cos[(a~ - ia I )x] \n= 2t\/. cos (a\u00a3 x)cosh(.\u00a3 x) + 2% sin(a\u2022 x)sinh (a I- x) \n=  .(x)cos(a\u00a3 x + .%(x)). \nSimilarly X, = N,(x)cos(aff x+ 9,(x)). \nHere ~,, ,  = + 2[t\/2,, cosh2(ai x) + v2v sinhZ(al-x)] 1\/2 (13) \n9.,v = tan-  1 [ __  tanh(a[ x).

Here we write: \n(7\" u = IS 2 ( ru  J- s I rv ) \/cos  (~(x I ) -[- s 1 ( ru -[- s 2 rv)\/COS (~o~; ) ] \/ [2 (s  2 - s  1 )] \n6. = [s~- (F. + s F F~)\/cos (~e[) - s 1 (F. + s 2 F~)\/cos ({c~ 2 )]\/[2(s 2- - s [  )] \n0\" v = [ (C .

The parameter values are \nA=0.1, B=0.9, 7=4000, D =8.3, D + =9.5, ~=0,5. For these parameters, the \nsolution is in category (b 0 on [0, 4) and category (a) on (~, 1], so that the envelope \nfunction N, is defined by (14) and (13) respectively on these subdomains. This \nsolution is a type B isolated pattern. (. . . . . . . . .  N,; v). \nIn the Appendix, we show that these forms imply that X,(x)  and Xv(x ) have at \nmost one turning point on [0, ~), and moreover that when this turning point \nexists, it differs from ~ by an amount hat is 0(7-1\/2) as the scale parameter \n7---,oe. In reaction-diffusion mechanisms with spatially homogeneous para- \nmeters, it is well-known that the domain has to be larger than a critical size, \ndependent on the kinetic parameters, for diffusion driven instability to be \niOossible with any diffusion coefficients (Arcuri and Murray, 1986; Murray, \n1989). For the Schnackenberg kinetics, with the typical values of A and B used \nin Fig. 3, this critical size corresponds to7 ~ 30. We find the same phenomenon \nin our inhomogeneous system, and moreover our numerical simulations \nsuggest that for parameter values corresponding to the case (bii), considerably \nhigher values of 7 are required for diffusion driven instability to occur (typically \n7 > 100). Thus whenever patterns arise in this case (bii), the solutions for both u \nand v will be monotonic on a large part of the subdomain [0, 4). \n(iii) Remaining cases. When s 1 , s 2 and 2 are real, e l  and c~ may be either \nreal or purely imaginary. Without loss of generality we can thus consider only \none remaining case, namely e~- real and e~- purely imaginary. By the definition \nof e~- and 0~, this requires that: \n(a -2 )+(cs~\/D- )>O and (a - -2 )+(cs~\/D- )<O.  \nDIFFUSION DRIVEN INSTABIL ITY  377 \nMultiplying these inequalities and using the expressions for the sum and \nproduct of the roots of (8) gives: \n22 - -  (a + d)2 + (ad - bc) < O. \nConditions (2a) and (2b) imply that this inequality can never be satisfied when \n2 > 0. Thus in this case the system cannot exhibit diffusion driven instability. \nThis classification of patterns in the two subdomains [0, ~) and (4, 1] into \nthe three categories (a), (bi) and (bii) depends on whether sf and @ are real or \ncomplex for j=  1, 2. This is independent of the scale parameter 7 near the \nbifurcation point (see below). This remains true in numerical simulations for a \nwider range of parameter values. For type A isolated patterns, we therefore \nrequire that the linear solutions (9) be in category (bii) on [0, 3) and in category \n(a) or (bi) on (4, 1]. For type B isolated patterns we require the solutions to be \nof category (a) or (bi) on both parts of the domain. The distinction between \ntype B isolated patterns and non-isolated patterns is arbitrary. \nWe will show below that whenever the system exhibits diffusion driven \ninstability, the solution on (4, 1] is in category (bi). It is therefore necessary and \nsufficient for type A isolated patterns that s~, s 2 ~ and ~,  ~2ei[~. We \ninvestigate these conditions further by considering the case of marginal \n+ + stability, that is 2=0 and D =Dcrit. Then s~- and s 2 are the roots of: \ncs-2+(D a-d)s - -D-b=O \nand e f  = [a + csf\/D ] 1\/2, j = 1, 2. We therefore require: \n0<(D a-d)Z+4D-bc (16) \nc (d-aD-)+{(D a-d)Z+4D-bc} 1\/2 \n0>a+ \u2022 (17) \nD-  2c \nSimplifying (17) gives: \naD-+d+{(D a-d)2+4D-bc}I\/2<O, \nwhich is satisfied if and only if both: \nand \nCondit ion \nO>aD- +d (18) \n0<(D a+d)2-(D-a-d)2-4D bc=4D-(ad-bc). (19) \n(2b) ensures that (19) is always satisfied. The inequality (16) is \nsatisfied if and only if D -<61 or D >(52,  where (51 and (52 are  the roots of \naZ~52+2(2bc-ad)(5+d2 =0. The conditions (2a,b) and (4) imply that these \nroots are real, distinct and positive, say 6z>(5 ~ >0,  and moreover that \n-d\/ae(61, (52)- Therefore (16) and (18) together give a single necessary and \n378 D.L. BENSON et al. \nsufficient condition for pattern to be isolated at marginal stability, which when \na > 0, as in the Schnackenberg model, is: \n1 [(ad-2bc)-2{bc(bc-ad)} 1\/2]. D-<61 =~ (20) \nNumerical simulations for the Schnackenberg model continue to predict \nisolated patterns for D < 61 when D + > De+it . For D slightly larger than 6a, \nthe patterns at marginal stability are type B isolated patterns. \nStraightforward manipulation of the inequalities (2a-d), which determine \nthe critical spatially homogeneous diffusion coefficient Dcr i t  , shows that in fact \nDcr i t  = 6 2 . At marginal stability, D + + = Ocrit > Ocrit , so that s~, s~ ~ ~ and the \nsolution is in category (bi) on (4, 1]. Numerical simulations again suggest that \n+ this result remains valid when D + > Dcrit. Similarly, the solution is in category \n(bi) on [0, ~) at marginal stability provided D->D~ri , .  The biological \nimplications of this analysis will be discussed in Section 4. \nOur analysis is based on a stepwise diffusion for a particular morphogen. \nThis may be set up by a smooth gradient in a control chemical which affects \nmorphogen diffusivity in a threshold manner. The phenomenon of isolated \npattern does not depend critically on the step function nature of diffusion: \nnumerical solutions indicate that a smoothly varying diffusion coefficient \nproduces imilar results (see Fig. 5). \nCa) \n14 \n12\" \nI0\" \nX \n6- \n4- \n2 \n0.'2 0.'4 0.'6 0.'8 I+0 \nx \n1.2 1 (b) 1.0 \nl X '\/I ,~- 1,0 0.9 ~ \nv i , \/ l  \n0.8 ', \/ \n0.8 \n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 \nx \nFigure 5.

Many sets of \nkinetics have been proposed to model the wide variety of predator-prey \ninteractions. Here we consider the simple model used by Segel and Jackson \n(1972) in their original application of diffusion driven instability to ecology. \nWhen appropriately non-dimensionalized in one space dimension, with a step \nfunction diffusivity for the predator species, the model equations are: \n~U ~2U \n- -  + 7(u+Ku2--#uv) (21a) \n0t - 0x 2 \n3v- 0 [D(x) OV] ~t (~X ~XX \"{- 7(NV--V2) (21b) \non 0 ~< x ~< 1. Here # and tc are positive constants, and as above, 7 is a scale \nparameter proportional to the dimensional length of the domain; D(x) is \ndefined in (5). Again, we consider zero flux boundary conditions, correspond- \ning to an enclosed omain. The trivial uniform steady state u = v = 0 is then \nunstable even to homogeneous perturbations, while the unique non-trivial \nsteady state u = v-- 1 \/ (#-  to) is positive and stable to homogeneous perturba- \ntions provided #>to and ~c< 1. As with the Schnackenberg kinetics, the \nremaining conditions for diffusion driven instability can be obtained from the \n+ dispersion relation (11), and have the form D + >Dcrit(D , 7, #, K, ~) when \nD - < Dcrit. Moreover, the linear solutions (9) again provide a good qualitative \napproximation to the full non-linear patterns (Fig. 6), and the results on \nenvelopes and isolation of pattern discussed in the previous sections can be \nsimilarly applied to this system. In contrast o the Schnackenberg kinetics, the \nSegel-Jackson system is a pure activator inhibitor model, and thus it predicts \npatterns in which the densities of the two species are in phase, as expected \nintuitively for a predator-prey interaction. \nUsing our results, we can investigate the question of environmental \ninstability. We consider interacting populations governed by (21), but with \nhomogeneous diffusivities, and with parameter values such that the steady \nstate u = v = 1 \/ (#-  K) is not driven unstable by diffusion. We then consider an \nenvironmental change which increases the dispersal rate of the predators in one \nsmall region of the domain, and ask: could this perturbation cause changes in \nthe population levels throughout the domain? To answer this, we plot D~+~i, \nagainst ~ for given values ofT, # and \u2022, and for a range of values ofD - (Fig. 7). \nThese results show that when the initial dispersal rate is close to Derit , a \nrelatively small increase in the diffusivity of the predators in a localized region \nat, one edge of the domain could result in D + being greater than D+it, and thus \nin a spatial pattern, even though the diffusivities are below the critical values for \ndiffusion driven instability on the majority of the domain.

Typically ~1 is considerably \nsmaller than Dcrit :for the values of# and tc used in Figs 7 and 8, 61 ~0.54 while \nDcrit~7.46. Thus our results suggest hat a small localized increase in the \ndiffusion of the predators could cause dramatic global alterations in the \npopulation densities in predator-prey systems. Moreover, the homogeneous \nsystem is similarly unstable to a small ocalized ecrease in the diffusion of the \nprey. \n4. Conclusions. Since Turing's (1952) realization that diffusion could give rise \nto pattern in systems of interacting biological or chemical species, reaction \ndiffusion models for pattern formation have been extensively studied, from \nboth mathematical nd biological viewpoints. However, despite xperimental \nevidence that some ecological and embryological systems may exhibit \nenvironmental inhomogeneities, the effects of spatially varying parameter \nvalues has received surprisingly little attention. We have considered a simple \ncase in which the diffusion coefficient of one of the reacting species varies in a \nstepwise manner across the domain. We have obtained the dispersion relation, \nwhose solutions determine the Turing space for the system, and we have \nobtained linear solutions which provide good qualitative approximations to\nthe full non-linear patterns. These linear solutions enable us to classify patterns \naccording to the degree of isolation. Furthermore this analysis provides insight \ninto the case of smoothly varying diffusion. \nOur results are applicable to all Turing-type mechanisms for pattern \nDIFFUSION DRIVEN INSTABILITY 381 \n12 \n11 \n. 10 \n+ o \nDerit 0)2 0.'4 \nD-=3.0 \nD-=6'OD_ =7.45-- ~ \no .'6 o .'8 \n]] \n1.0 \nFigure 7.

In the case of embryology, they suggest a two step morphogenetic \nprocess. In the first step a simple pattern of diffusion coefficients i set up, which \nthen regulates the pattern formation properties of the more complicated \nreaction-diffusion system. Our analysis shows how such a hierarchy of \nmechanisms may result in the isolation of pattern within a domain. One \npossible application of these results is suggested by recent experiments by \nWolpert and Hornbruch (1990) which show that in the chick limb bud the \ncartilage rudiment of the humerus is isolated largely in the anterior portion of \nthe domain. When applied to predator-prey interactions, our results suggest \nthat a small localized increase in the dispersal rate of either species could cause \ndramatic global alterations in the population, due to the propagation of the \nenvironmental perturbation throughout the domain. These examples illustrate \nthat environmental inhomogeneity could be an important regulator of \nbiological and ecological pattern formation. \nD.L.B. acknowledges the Wellcome Trust for a Prize Studentship in \nMathematical Biology.
