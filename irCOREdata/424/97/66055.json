INTRODUCTION\nHydrogen bonds exhibit a wide range of structural and\ndynamic characteristics and play a fundamental role in many\naspects of molecular science. Whereas many hydrogen bonds\ncan be thought of as giving rise to a modest perturbation of\nthe properties of molecules, short, strong hydrogen bonds\n\u0001SSHBs\u0002 constitute a much stronger perturbation, which can\nresult in a unique physical or chemical behavior. SSHBs are\nthought to play a fundamental role in stabilizing the interme-\ndiate state of certain enzymatic reactions through a subtle\nmodification of the local environment of the hydrogen\nbond.1,2 Other implications of SSHBs in inhibitor potency of\nactive site3 or in stabilization of the photoactive yellow\nprotein4 have been shown. DNA is an example of hydrogen\nbonded molecular system which contains the genetic code of\nliving beings. Coding depends on the base-pair sequences\nand also on minor chemical changes to the nucleosides, such\nas the methylation of cytosine, which give rise to epigenetic\neffects.5 In this context, the temperature dependent dynamics\nof protons in DNA hydrogen bonds and the chemical integ-\nrity of the base-pair molecules are vital to the reliability of\ngenetic coding.\nThe unique property of SSHBs of interest in this paper is\nthe proton migration with increasing temperature away from\nthe donor atom towards or beyond the center of the hydrogen\nbond. This effect has been observed by neutron diffraction in\na number of compounds: urea phosphoric acid \u0001UPA\u0002,6,7\npyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid \u0001PDA\u0002,8,9 1:2 cocrystal of\nbenzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylic acid and 4,4\u0001-bipyridyl\n\u0001BTA-BPY\u0002,10 and 1:1 crystal of 2-methylpyridien and pen-\ntachlorophenol \u00014-MP-PCP\u000211.\nTemperature dependent proton migration can be thought\nof as being structurally or vibrationally driven. Lattice ex-\npansion could be sufficient to modify the geometry of the\nSSHB in an appropriate way, or there could be a subtle struc-\ntural reorganization with temperature that favors a centered\nposition of the proton in the hydrogen bond.

Total energy\ncalculations based on density functional theory \u0001DFT\u0002 meth-\nods showed the structures with a short donor-H distance to\nbe most stable whatever the size of the unit cell is. Molecular\ndynamics \u0001MD\u0002 with DFT revealed the proton migration ef-\nfect. Analysis of the simulation trajectories showed low fre-\nquency lattice vibrations to be responsible for stabilizing the\ncrystal structure at nonzero temperatures in such a way that\nthe minimum of the average potential shifts towards the cen-\nter of the hydrogen bond. The purpose of this paper is there-\nfore to investigate whether the same mechanism drives pro-\nton migration in the other SSHBs.\nUPA is a complicated system in that the crystal structure\nhas many intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which involve all\nhydrogen atoms, and only one of which is short. As a result\nof this three-dimensional \u00013D\u0002 coupled network, particular\nphonons could not be identified as driving proton migration.\nThe three other systems presented here have simpler hydro-\ngen bond networks: two-dimensional \u00012D\u0002 sheets in the case\nof PDA, one-dimensional \u00011D\u0002 chains for BTA-BPY, and\ndimers for 4-MP-PCP. In contrast to UPA in which the SSHB\nis a O\u2013H\u00afO bond, the three samples here present short\nN\u2013H\u00afO bonds. In these three systems, there are fewer hy-\ndrogen bonds, which allow the hydrogen bond vibrations to\nbe highlighted via selective deuteration in INS experiments.\nThe three systems are also more pronounced examples of\nproton migration, the proton being transferred beyond the\ncenter of the hydrogen bond from donor to acceptor atoms.\nIn this case does the vibrationally stabilized, time-averaged\npotential well take the proton continuously from donor to\nacceptor as a function of temperature?\nIn this paper we focus mainly on PDA for which we\nhave used INS to investigate the molecular and hydrogen\nbond vibrations. These measurements are confronted with\nphonon calculations based on DFT methods, which allow the\nvibrational modes to be assigned, and mapping and anhar-\nmonic analyses of the hydrogen bond potential well. MD\nsimulations using the same DFT methods allow temperature\ndependent effects to be investigated. These are not con-\nstrained to the low temperature crystal structure via the har-\nmonic approximation, like thermal amplitudes determined\nfrom phonon calculations. For the other two samples, BTA-\nBPY and 4MP-PCP, only MD simulations have been per-\nformed to investigate directly proton migration. Experimen-\ntal and computational details are described in the next\nsection, and thereafter results are presented for each of the\nthree systems.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nPDA was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used in pro-\ntonated form without further purification. The hydrogen\nbonds were deuterated by multiple recrystallizations from\nD2O. INS spectra were measured at a temperature of \u000520 K\non the inverted geometry spectrometers, IN1 at ILL \u0001Ref. 13\u0002\nand TOSCA at ISIS.14\nIII. NUMERICAL DETAILS\nAll DFT calculations were performed using the VASP DFT\ncode.15\u201318 We used projector augmented wave \u0001PAW\u0002\npseudopotentials with a plane wave cutoff of 700 eV in com-\nbination with the PBE functional.19 This energy cutoff is\nmuch higher than we normally use \u0001270 eV\u0002 and is found to\ngive a significantly better description of the SSHBs. The\nk-point spacing was typically 0.1 \u00c5\u22121.\nAs for organic crystals20\u201324 and biopolymers,25 phonon\ncalculations were performed for PDA using the direct\nmethod as implemented in the PHONON code.26 A supercell is\nconstructed from the optimized unit cell structure, which al-\nlows all nonzero force constants to be determined when the\ncrystallographically inequivalent atoms are displaced from\ntheir equilibrium positions. The force constants from VASP\ncalculations are used to generate the dynamical matrix in\nPHONON, which is then diagonalized for a large number of\nrandomly chosen points in the reciprocal lattice to obtain the\nvibrational density of states \u0001vDOS\u0002. S\u0001Q ,w\u0002 is calculated\nfrom the vDOS in the incoherent approximation for the spe-\ncific geometry and resolution of each spectrometer.\nMolecular dynamics simulations were also performed\nwith VASP. The results presented here were obtained in the\nNVE ensemble, that is, without coupling to an external heat\nbath. A time step of 1 fs was used, and the total simulation\ntime was typically 5\u201310 ps. vDOSs were extracted from MD\ntrajectories using NMOLDYN,27 and otherwise geometrical in-\nformation was obtained directly from the time-dependent\natomic coordinates.\nThe potential energy well for the proton in the hydrogen\nbond was determined for any given structure by calculating\nthe crystal energy as a function of the displacement of the\nproton along the donor-acceptor direction. The energy levels\nwithin a potential well were determined from a numerical\nsolution of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation, assuming the mass of the\noscillator to be that of the proton.\nIV. RESULTS\nA. Pyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid\n1. Structure\nThe structure of pyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid was re-\nported at a number of temperatures in the range of 15\u2013296 K\nby Cowan8 and Cowan et al.9 PDA crystallizes in the P21\/c\nspace group with four molecules in the unit cell. One short\nstrong N1\u2013H5\u00afO4 and a \u201cnormal\u201d O\u2013H\u00afO hydrogen bond\nlink the molecules in two-dimensional planar sheets in the\na-b plane.\nOptimizing the crystal structure with VASP leaves the a\nand b axes almost unchanged but causes a significant expan-\nsion in the interplane, c direction due to the underestimate of\nvan der Waals \u0001vdW\u0002 interactions in the DFT method. All\nsimulations for PDA \u0001and the other samples\u0002 have therefore\n234503-2 Fontaine-Vive et al. J. Chem. Phys. 124, 234503 \u00022006\u0001\nDownloaded 27 Apr 2011 to 129.234.252.66. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jcp.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nbeen performed in the experimentally determined unit cells.\nThe short hydrogen bond geometry is reasonably well repro-\nduced with a N\u2013O length of 2.55 \u00c5, a N\u2013H length of 1.12 \u00c5,\nand a NHO angle of 176.5\u00b0 compared to the corresponding\nexperimental values of 2.523 \u00c5, 1.213 \u00c5, and 176.4\u00b0 \u0001see\nTable I\u0002. The calculated N\u2013H bond length is determined by\nthe minimum in the potential energy surface, whereas the\nexperimental value takes into account the zero point energy\nand the wave function of the hydrogen atom. Analyzing the\nenergy levels in the potential well of the proton along the\nN\u2013O direction \u0001see below\u0002 gives the underestimate of the\nN\u2013H bond length to be 0.03 \u00c5. However, the normal\nO\u2013H\u00afO hydrogen bond becomes shorter than the N\u2013H\u00afO\nbond in terms of donor-acceptor distances, although the pro-\nton is tightly bound to the donor oxygen atom as indicated by\nthe O\u2013H distance of 1.05 \u00c5 \u0001see Table II\u0002.\n2. Inelastic neutron scattering and phonon\ncalculations\nThe INS spectra for fully protonated PDA and a hydro-\ngen bond deuterated sample \u0001H4 and H5 in Fig. 1\u0002, both\nmeasured on TOSCA, are shown in Fig. 2 \u0001upper curve in\neach panel\u0002. Also shown for each sample are the results of\nthe corresponding VASP-PHONON calculations, with only the\nmasses of the atoms changing in the construction of the cor-\nresponding dynamical matrices.\nThe main effect of deuterating the two hydrogen bonds\nin PDA is the pronounced reduction in intensity of the band\nat 1400 cm\u22121. Inspection of the eigenvectors shows the band\nto represent a wagging motion of the N\u2013H and O\u2013H bonds.\nIn the harmonic approximation, the stretching vibrations are\nfound at the same frequency of 2200 cm\u22121 for the proton in\nboth types of hydrogen bond in the calculation, but these are\nnot observed in the INS spectra, even allowing for low in-\ntensity and poor statistics.\nMapping out the potential well of the proton in the\nN\u2013H\u00afO bond shows a single-well, asymmetric form similar\nTABLE I.

Numerical solutions\nof Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation for a proton in this potential give a\nstretch-vibration frequency of 1470 cm\u22121. Allowing for a\nhigher oscillator mass due to the coupling of such a low\nfrequency, stretch vibration with other vibrational modes in-\ndicates that the main spectral change on deuteration also in-\nvolves the stretching vibration.\n3. Molecular dynamics\nThe forces needed to determine the acceleration of atoms\nin a MD simulation are derived in the same way as the forces\nneeded in a phonon calculation. Thus having validated the\nDFT forces against INS experimental data, the MD simula-\ntion can be expected to describe accurately the solid state\ndynamics of PDA. MD simulations were performed at three\ntemperatures: 15, 250, and 300 K.\nIn view of the range of values discussed above for the\nN\u2013H stretch frequency in the SSHB, it is useful to consider\nthe vDOS extracted from the MD simulations for the protons\nin the two hydrogen bonds \u0001Fig. 4\u0002. Despite the hydrogen\nbonds having similar lengths in the optimized structure and\nat low temperature in the MD simulations \u0001Tables I and II\u0002,\ntheir vDOSs behave very differently with increasing tem-\nperature. The O\u2013H\u00afO bond assumes a geometry \u0001Table II\u0002\nand vDOS of a normal hydrogen bond as the temperature\nincreases with the stretching mode moving to higher fre-\nquency. On the other hand, the SSHB shows the opposite\nbehavior. The stretching band is found at \u00051800 cm\u22121 at the\nlowest temperature, while at 250 K and above, the band has\nmerged with the wagging band at 1400 cm\u22121, as indicated by\nthe foregoing analysis of the anharmonic potential well.\nExtracting the donor-H distances from the MD trajecto-\nries \u0001Table I and Fig. 5\u0002 underestimates the extent of proton\ntransfer in the N\u2013H\u00afO bond, as for UPA, the average proton\nposition moving to the center of the hydrogen bond. How-\never the time-dependent trace of the N\u2013H and H\u00afO dis-\ntances shows clearly that the proton is bistable, spending\nmost of its time to the left or right of center and relatively\nlittle time at the center. This behavior is particularly evident\nfrom the histogram of the N\u2013H distance over the whole MD\ntrajectory. In contrast, the O\u2013H\u00afO bond, which the vDOS\nindicates to be a normal hydrogen bond at 250 K, shows no\nproton migration, the proton remaining tightly bound to the\ndonor O atom \u0001Fig. 5, top panels\u0002.\nTaking typical structures from the extrema of the 300 K\ntrace in Fig. 5 and one for the centered position of the proton\nin the hydrogen bond allows the corresponding potential en-\nergy wells to be calculated \u0001Fig. 6\u0002. For the extreme positions\nof the protons, asymmetric single wells are calculated. The\ncentered proton position corresponds to a broad-bottomed\npotential well. The energy levels in these wells give rise to\nvibration frequencies ranging from 1200 cm\u22121 for the cen-\ntered proton to 1500 cm\u22121 for the offset proton position, and\ntherefore, at ambient temperature, the N\u2013H stretch vibration\ncannot drive proton migration. However the flat-bottomed\npotential well for the centered proton does allow the proton\nwave function to spread out and facilitate the passage of the\nproton from one side of the bond to the other.\nThe amplitude of the Fourier transform \u0001FT\u0002 of the time-\ndependent traces in Fig. 5 is shown in Fig. 7, which therefore\nshows the strength of the modulation of the N\u2013H distance as\na function of vibration frequency. The most pronounced fea-\ntures are a low frequency band \u0001\u000150 cm\u22121\u0002 and peaks at 115\nand 145 cm\u22121.

While\nat the \u0002 point these infinitely long wavelength modes do not\nmodulate the hydrogen bond geometry, this modulation can\nbe achieved by shorter wavelength modes away from the \u0002\npoint. These non-\u0002-point modes would account for the first\nlow frequency peak in the FT. The next in-plane vibrations\noccur at 125 and 155 cm\u22121, which, allowing for an anhar-\nmonic correction, match well the peaks observed at 115 and\n145 cm\u22121 in the FT. Figure 8 shows the eigenvector of one of\nthe modes at 155 cm\u22121, which clearly modulates the geom-\netry of the hydrogen bond.\nPartially deuterated PDA presents, experimentally, a\nmore pronounced proton transfer effect, the smaller zero\npoint motion tending to localize the proton nearer the donor\nor acceptor atom. As mentioned above, zero point motion is\nnot included in our MD simulations and calculated proton\ntransfer in the partially deuterated compound is very similar\nto that of the fully protonated compound \u0001compare Tables I\nand III\u0002.

If high frequency vibrations played a role in proton\ntransfer, then the strong variation of these frequencies upon\ndeuteration would lead to markedly different proton dynam-\nics. That similar proton transfer effects are observed for pro-\ntonated and deuterated compounds is further evidence of the\ndominant role of low frequency lattice dynamics.\nB. 1:2 cocrystal of benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylic\nacid and 4,4\u0001-bipyridyl\n1.

DISCUSSION\nUsing INS and ab initio MD, we have investigated three\nmore hydrogen-bonded systems that show proton migration\nas a function of temperature. In these systems the SSHB are\nof the type N\u2013H\u00afO, compared to UPA which has an\nO\u2013H\u00afO SSHB. Proton migration is therefore not chemi-\ncally limited to a particular type of hydrogen bond.\nNeutron diffraction provides the reference crystallo-\ngraphic data, which are the basis of all simulations presented\nhere. As in the case of UPA, solid state DFT methods tend, in\ngeometry optimization and low temperature MD calcula-\ntions, to overestimate the donor-acceptor distance and under-\nestimate the donor-H distance, which hinders the proton mi-\ngration effect in the simulations. This trend is most\npronounced in the case of 4MP-PCP to the extent that there\nis no evidence of proton migration in the MD simulations. In\n4MP-PCP the hydrogen bonds connect the two molecules in\ndimers, whereas all other systems studied present infinite\nchains \u0001BTA-BPY\u0002, 2D sheets \u0001PDA\u0002, or 3D networks\n\u0001UPA\u0002. Infinite networks of hydrogen bonds provide long\nrange constraints that do not exist for a dimer, and in this\ncase the SSHBs have more freedom to lengthen on geometry\noptimization.\nIn all other cases, the extent of proton migration in MD\nsimulations is less than in the corresponding measurements.\nIncreasing the temperature above that of the experiments\nhelps to an extent but does not allow the full amplitude of\nFIG. 10. Geometries obtained for the\nshort hydrogen bond N1\u00afH1\u00afO22\nin BTA-BPY by MD simulation at\nthree temperatures.

In addition to the problems men-\ntioned above of SSHB geometry, the fact that the protons are\ntreated as classical, point particles instead of partially delo-\ncalized wave functions also hinders proton migration. Calcu-\nlation of the eigenfunctions in the potential well of the pro-\nton along the donor-acceptor direction indicates that\nneglecting the zero point motion amounts to a shift of\n\u00050.03 \u00c5 of the proton away from the center of the SSHB,\ncompared to a transfer distance of \u00050.1 \u00c5.\nOne significant difference between the N\u2013H\u00afO SSHBs\nstudied here and the O\u2013H\u00afO SSHB in UPA is that, experi-\nmentally, the protons in all three cases migrate beyond the\ncenter of the hydrogen bond. In BTA-BPY evidence of this\nbehavior is seen in the histogram of proton positions \u0001Fig.\n10\u0002 and the time-dependent traces of the N\u2013H distance which\nclearly show the proton spending a significant amount of\ntime beyond the center of the hydrogen bond. This effect is\nmuch clearer in PDA. The time dependence of the N\u2013H dis-\ntance shows almost periodic hopping of the proton from one\nside of the hydrogen bond to the other, and the histogram\nclearly shows two peaks separated by \u00050.1 \u00c5, as in the ex-\nperiment.\nFourier transforming the time domain information shows\nthat, as in the case of UPA, low frequency lattice vibrations\nare driving proton migration. For BTA-BPY, the time depen-\ndence of the N\u2013H distance does not show any obvious modu-\nlation and there are no clear peaks in the FT. For PDA, there\nis almost periodic hopping across the center of the hydrogen\nbond \u0001period 100\u2013200 fs\u0002 and the FT \u0001Fig. 7\u0002 shows an ini-\ntial peak at low frequency \u0001\u000150 cm\u22121\u0002 and two well-defined\npeaks at 115 and 145 cm\u22121. INS and phonon calculations\nshow that these features correspond to vibrations in the plane\nof the molecular sheets which give rise to the strongest\nmodulation of the hydrogen bond geometry.\nAnalyzing structures for PDA from the MD trajectories\nshow that the lattice vibrations tend to stabilize the proton\nposition on either side of the SSHB rather than in the center.\nThe corresponding potential wells are single well and asym-\nmetric for the offset proton positions and flat bottomed for\nthe central position. In a model of a single particle oscillator\nof one proton mass, the calculated vibrational frequencies are\nlowest for the flat-bottomed potential with a limiting value of\n1200 cm\u22121. These N\u2013H stretching movements, coupled in\nreality to other high frequency vibrations, can never play a\nrole in proton migration which occurs at temperatures lower\nthan 300 K.\nThe apparent bistable behavior of SSHBs in which pro-\ntons migrate beyond the center of the hydrogen bonds has\nnot been detected experimentally. The time-dependent traces\nand histograms shown here are in the reference frame in\nwhich the donor N atom is stationary. Calculating the same\nquantities in the reference frame centered at the origin of the\ncrystallographic cell gives rise to broad, featureless histo-\ngrams. Diffraction measurements only have access to these\nbroad distributions. Spectroscopic measurements would\ntherefore be required to probe a two-site jump process as\nhave been performed for quantum tunneling between the two\nwells of the potential of a normal hydrogen bond.28 Whereas\nthese quasielastic measurements were performed with \u0003eV\nresolution, that is, on the nanosecond time scale, only meV\nresolution would be required to detect the fast hopping pro-\ncess predicted here.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nWe have extended initial work on proton migration in\nSSHBs in UPA to three more systems which show proton\ntransfer. If DFT methods allow hydrogen bond geometries to\nbe accurately determined \u0001two out of three cases studied\nhere\u0002, then MD simulations show the same effect as seen in\nneutron diffraction experiments, albeit to a lesser extent. The\ntwo systems for which the simulations are successful reveal\nthe same mechanism for proton migration, as in UPA; that is,\nlattice vibrations stabilize solid state structures at nonzero\ntemperatures for which the proton is partially or completely\ntransferred. When a proton transfers completely from donor\nto acceptor, as in PDA and BTA-BPY, a bistable regime ex-\nists at intermediate temperature where the proton avoids a\nrelatively unstable, centered position. In the case of PDA,\nspecific phonons which modulate the SSHB geometry are\nseen to be responsible for proton transfer.\nWhile many systems have SSHBs, only a few show pro-\nton migration behavior. Understanding this type of behavior\nrequires a precise knowledge of the low frequency dynamics\nof the system, which has been achieved here for PDA with\nINS experiments and phonon calculations. Having identified\nspecific phonons that drive proton migration, it would be\nuseful to characterize the lattice dynamics of SSHB systems\nthat do not show proton migration. In view of the key role of\ndynamics in proton migration, predicting the activity of\nSSHBs in complex systems is clearly very challenging.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful to Sasha Ivanov, Charlotte Broder, and\nElinor Spencer for initial work on PDA, Ron Ghosh for set-\nting up computational facilities at ILL, and Didier Richard\nfor help with visualizing simulation results.\n1 W.
