Self-reported physical activity was measured at follow-up eight \nweeks later. N=137 participants completed measures at both time points (55.4% \nresponse rate at follow-up).  \nResults: Hierarchical regression showed that perceived intergoal facilitation, but not \nintergoal conflict, directly predicted physical activity beyond intention and perceived \nbehavioural control (PBC), accounting for more than four percent of additional \nvariance in physical activity. Intergoal facilitation had an indirect effect on intention \nthrough attitude and PBC, and intention partially mediated the effect of intergoal \nfacilitation on behaviour.  \nConclusion: The perceived facilitating effect of pursuing other personal goals predicts \nthe performance of a health-related behaviour over and above single behaviour-focused \nsocial cognitions. \n \nKeywords: Personal projects, theory of planned behaviour, multiple goals, physical activity, \nintention, facilitation \n*Main document (inc. abstract, figs and tables)\n 2 \nWith a little help from my goals: Integrating intergoal facilitation with the theory of \nplanned behaviour to predict physical activity \n \nEveryday life is characterised by the pursuit of many goals; some normatively ordinary, some \nwildly idiosyncratic. Striving towards these goals involves performing multiple goal-directed \nbehaviours (Carver & Scheier, 1998). Goal-directed health behaviours, such as physical \nactivity, are thus embedded within idiosyncratic systems of goal pursuit and cannot be fully \nunderstood in isolation (Austin & Vancouver, 1996). However, predominant theoretical \nmodels used to study health behaviour, such as the theory of planned behaviour (TPB; Ajzen, \n1991), isolate a health behaviour under investigation from the wider system of goal pursuit \n(Abraham & Sheeran, 2003). Such \u201ebehavioural segregation\u201f assumes that either goal-\ndirected behaviours are performed independently and without influencing one another, or that \nany such influence is mediated by cognitions and perceptions about the target behaviour (e.g. \npursuing competing time-consuming goals may result in reduced perceived behavioural \ncontrol for the target behaviour). This study aims to test whether these assumptions are \nsupported by evidence or whether multiple goal pursuit has an independent effect in \npredicting a particular health-related behaviour such as physical activity.  \nFrequently used to predict physical activity, the TPB proposes that behaviour is a \nlinear function of intention to perform the behaviour and perceived behavioural control \n(PBC) over performing the behaviour. Intention is in turn hypothesised to be a linear function \nof cognitions and perceptions (i.e., attitude, subjective norm, and PBC), each based on more \nspecific beliefs (Ajzen, 1991). A review of 72 studies using the TPB (and its antecedent, the \ntheory of reasoned action; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975) to predict physical activity-related \nbehaviour revealed that the model accounted for 44% and 27% of the variance in intention \nand behaviour, respectively (Hagger, Chatzisarantis, & Biddle, 2002). The predictive utility \nof the model has contributed to its wide application. However, several conceptual and \nempirical limitations have been identified (Ogden, 2003; Sniehotta, 2009b). For example, the \n 3 \nassumption that the direct predictors, intention and PBC, are exhaustive in mediating all other \ninfluences on behaviours is not supported by evidence (Sniehotta, 2009a). Instead, there is \ngood evidence for a growing number of additional independent predictors (Conner & \nArmitage, 1998) and moderators (Cooke & Sheeran, 2004). Though these additions challenge \nthe parsimony of the model that is often seen as one of its main strengths, the utility of \nadditional predictors has particular relevance in applied research by providing potential new \ntargets upon which to map intervention techniques to change behaviour (Michie, Johnston, \nFrancis, Hardeman, & Eccles, 2008). These tests of theory augmentation provide important \nadvances, though few address the issue of behavioural segregation. Rhodes and Blanchard \n(2008) provide an exception to this by investigating sedentary behaviours alongside physical \nactivity using the TPB. They found that intention to watch television predicted additional \nvariance in physical activity (PA) behaviour beyond PA-specific intention and PBC. \nHowever, sedentary behaviours are but one of many potential activities individuals pursue. \nBecause individuals strive for many different personally-salient goals at a time, the focus of \nthe present study was on assessing how these other personal goals as a goal system may \ninfluence participating in physical activity.  \nAssessing multiple personal goals \nSeveral Personal Action Constructs (PACs) have been introduced to encompass the \nidiosyncratic features and inter-related nature of the goals which form individuals\u201f personal \ngoal systems (Cantor, 1990). These PACs include concepts such as personal projects (Little, \n1983), personal strivings (Emmons, 1986), current concerns (Klinger, 1977), and life tasks \n(Cantor, Norem, Niedenthal, Langston, & Brower, 1987). Personal projects were selected for \nthis study to represent the range of personal goals characterising the objectives that an \nindividual is currently pursuing in the context of their life (Little, 1996). Defined as \n\u201cextended sets of personally salient action in context\u201d (Little, 2007, p.25), personal projects \n 4 \ncan be studied using a standard elicitation and rating methodology known as personal \nprojects analysis (PPA; Little & Gee, 2007). PPA and similar methodologies have been used \nto investigate how features of individuals\u201f personal goal systems relate to health behaviours. \nWomen who exercised to achieve higher-order \u201eweight loss\u201f or \u201ehealth benefit\u201f goals reported \nless physical activity than those who exercised for higher-order and more \u201ewell-being\u201f and \n\u201estress reduction\u201f goals (Segar, Eccles, & Richardson, 2008). There is also some evidence \nsuggesting a predictive association between features of individuals\u201f goal system and health \nbehaviour. Perceptions of social support and meaningfulness of individuals\u201f most important \npersonal goal negatively predicted alcohol consumption beyond social and affect-enhancing \n\u201emotives\u201f (i.e. outcome expectations), respectively (Lecci, MacLean, & Croteau, 2002). \nFurthermore, perceptions of how different personal goals affect each others\u201f pursuit has been \nfound to predict physical activity (Riediger & Freund, 2004), and marijuana initiation and use \n(Simons & Carey, 2003). Together, these results suggest that the influence of the wider \nsystem of personal goal pursuit on performance of a particular health-related behaviour \nshould be considered. However, to our knowledge, no study has yet investigated whether the \nperceived influence of a personal goal system predicts the performance of a health-related \nbehaviour beyond a specific social cognition model such as the TPB. \nIntergoal conflict, intergoal facilitation and physical activity \nPursuit of a particular goal implies resource (e.g. time, energy, money) consumption \nthat may leave fewer resources available for the remainder of the goals the individual may be \nactively pursuing (Kruglanski et al., 2002). Depending upon the structure and content of an \nindividual\u201fs goal system, this between-goal competition can potentially lead to goal pursuits \ninfluencing one another in two independent ways: 1) facilitating, whereby pursuit of Goal X \nhelpfully leads to or is associated with pursuit of Goal Y; and\/or 2) conflicting, whereby \npursuit of Goal X impedes or interferes with pursuit of Goal Y (Riediger & Freund, 2004). \n 5 \nIntergoal facilitation should be distinguished from Triandis\u201f facilitating conditions construct \n(Triandis, 1980). While the latter explicitly reflects external environmental and situational \nfactors that influence performance of a behaviour, intergoal facilitation is specifically to do \nwith the extent to which pursuing one goal is perceived to helpfully influence the pursuit of \nanother goal.  \nTraditionally, conflict and facilitation have been measured as two opposing poles \nalong the same bipolar continuum. However, Riediger and Freund (2004) provide evidence \nsuggesting that intergoal conflict and intergoal facilitation are better conceptualised as two \nseparate constructs and compellingly argue for their independent measurement. \nPrevious studies investigating the effect of intergoal conflict and facilitation on \nbehaviour have mainly done so without considering existing social cognition models such as \nthe TPB. Cross-sectional research has shown that non-exercisers reported exercising as \ninterfering with pursuing a number of their other personal goals (Gebhardt & Maes, 1998). \nExtending these findings, Karoly and colleagues (2005) investigated self-regulatory \ncognitions (e.g. self-monitoring, planning, social comparison) related to an exercise goal and \na personal goal most interfering with it. Comparing regular to irregular exercisers, the latter \nshowed significantly higher self-regulatory cognitions towards the conflicting goal, whereas \nregular exercisers showed no such difference between the exercise goal and the goal most \ninterfering with it. In a longitudinal study, Riediger and Freund (2004) showed that intergoal \nfacilitation but not intergoal conflict predicted objective gym attendance four and five months \nafter baseline (but not at 1, 2, or 3 months). Within a number of control analyses, Riediger \n(2001) separately controlled for self-efficacy or for how concrete participants ideas about \ntheir future activities were and found that the joint addition of intergoal facilitation and \nconflict significantly added to the prediction of exercise behaviour averaged over 5 months. It \nremains unclear whether effects would remain robust when simultaneously controlling for \n 6 \nstandard measures of both, intention and perceived behavioural control, and whether these \neffects only play a role in long-term (>3 months) goal pursuit. \nThe present study \nThis study aimed to integrate the TPB and components of goal theory to enhance the \nprediction of health behaviour. We used TPB constructs as a theoretical foundation and \ninvestigated whether perceived intergoal relationships enhanced the prediction of the two \nmain outcomes in the TPB; intention and behaviour. Evidence and theory led us to propose \nthree competing hypotheses, which we evaluated against one another: \nHypothesis 1: Independent prediction of behaviour beyond the TPB \nResults from the literature demonstrate a predictive effect of intergoal facilitation and \nintergoal conflict on health behaviour. We therefore hypothesised that the perceived \nfacilitating and conflicting effect of pursuing other personal goals would directly predict \nhealth behaviour when simultaneously controlling for intention and PBC from the TPB. \nHypothesis 2: Interaction between intention and multiple goal pursuit constructs \nIt may be that individuals with strong intention to perform a health-related behaviour do so \nmore or less frequently depending on the helpful or hindering effect of pursuing other \nconcomitant projects. Given the literature suggesting that strong intention does not always \nlead to behavioural performance (Orbell & Sheeran, 1998), we hypothesised that individuals \nwith high intention would show significantly higher performance when their other personal \ngoals are perceived to highly facilitate or have low conflict with the focal PA behaviour.  \nHypothesis 3: Effect of multiple goal pursuit constructs mediated by the TPB \nAjzen and Manstead (2007) suggest that the TPB\u201fs constructs should mediate all other \n\u201ebackground\u201f variables\u201f (e.g. environmental, personal, and demographic) effects on intention \nand behaviour. The perceived influence of other goal pursuits could arguably be considered \namong these background variables. Pursuit of other projects may influence an individuals\u201f \n 7 \nintention to perform a particular health-related behaviour by affecting their attitude, \nsubjective norm, and\/or perceived control over performing that health-related behaviour. We \ntherefore hypothesised that perceived intergoal facilitation and conflict would influence \nintention, and be mediated the predictors of intention in the TPB. \nMethod \nParticipants \nAt Time 1 during regular term time, a sample of 260 undergraduate students (mean age = \n21.05 years; sd = 6.28; 201 [77.3%] women, 58 [22.3%] men) in the north-east of Scotland \ncompleted baseline measures. At Time 2, two months later, 144 participants completed \nfollow-up measures (response rate = 55.4%). The final sample comprised 137 participants (7 \nparticipants were excluded due to not fully completing the Time 1 procedure). Drop out \nanalyses found no significant differences in terms of age, gender, intention, attitude, \nsubjective norm, PBC, intergoal facilitation, or intergoal conflict (all ps >.08). \nMeasures and procedure \u2013 Time 1 \nThe measures integrated standard TPB items into a tailored personal project analysis (PPA) \nframework, and were administered at Time 1 to consenting participants using a modified \nMicrosoft Excel-based procedure originally developed by Little (2006). Participants were \nasked to list up to 11 personal projects which they would actively pursue (on more than one \noccasion) during the subsequent 3 months. Personal projects were defined as \u201cthings you \nchoose to do or things you have to do; they may be things you are working towards or things \nyou are trying to avoid. Personal Projects may be related to any aspect of your daily life: \nuniversity, work, home, leisure and community, among others\u201d (c.f. Little, 2006). Given the \nlongitudinal follow-up, we instructed participants to focus on projects they would be actively \nengaged in over the next 3 months. To avoid \u201eartificial\u201f projects, respondents were allowed to \nenter fewer than the total possible number of projects (Wallenius, 2000). Subsequent to \n 8 \nproject elicitation (and in a departure from traditional PPA), two projects were added to \nparticipants\u201f lists such that each person would have two projects common between them: \n\u201eparticipate in regular physical activity\u201f and \u201eregularly study before\/after class for my uni \ncourses\u201f. Given that \u201eparticipate in regular physical activity\u201f was added to everyone\u201fs list, it \nwas deliberately kept at a general level in order to represent whatever constituted regular \nphysical activity for each participant. Participants were then asked to refine their list to at \nmost eight projects that they felt were the most important to describing their lives, while also \ntaking care to exclude any of their projects that were identical or nearly identical to either of \nthe two added projects.  \nFollowing elicitation and refinement of projects, participants completed a TPB \nquestionnaire on participating in regular physical activity, using direct measures with \nwording based on Armitage (2005)1. Intention to participate in regular physical activity was \nmeasured with three items (Cronbach\u201fs \u03b1 = .75): e.g. \u201chow often do you intend to participate \nin regular physical activity?\u201d (1-Never to 7-Frequently). PBC was measured with four items \n(Cronbach\u201fs \u03b1 = .91): e.g. \u201cI am confident that I can participate in physical activity on a \nregular basis\u201d (1-Disagree to 7-Agree). Attitude was measured on semantic differential scales \nusing the common stem \u201cfor me, participating in regular physical activity would be\u2026\u201d \nfollowed by six different items, all scaled from 1 to 7 (Cronbach\u201fs \u03b1 = .86): (Boring-\nStimulating); (Bad-Good); (Unhealthy-Healthy); (Dull-Interesting); (Unpleasant-Pleasant); \n(Useless-Useful). Finally, Subjective Norm was assessed using three items (Cronbach\u201fs \u03b1 = \n.73): e.g. \u201cpeople who are important to me would...\u201d (1-Disapprove of my participation in \nregular physical activity to 7-Approve of my participation in regular physical activity).  \n                                               \n1 Note: The wording used was identical to Armitage (2005) except for the following changes: Armitage (2005) \nused two intention items, whereas we added an additional intention item: \u201cI do not intend to participate in \nregular physical activity\u201d (reverse scored). Furthermore, we described all intention items in terms of \u201eparticipate \nin regular physical activity\u201f. For PBC, we replaced \u201cHow much personal control do you feel you have over \nparticipating in regular physical activity?\u201d (Armitage, 2005, p.237) with the example provided in the measures \nand procedure section. \n 9 \nParticipants then rated their personal projects on a series of standard PPA dimensions \n(e.g. importance, difficulty \u2013 not reported here), including measures of intergoal facilitation \nand conflict. In standard PPA, the latter two are typically assessed together using a project \ncross-impact matrix (Little, 1983) wherein participants iteratively rate the extent that each \nproject conflicts with and facilitates each other project. We sought to maintain standard PPA \nmodules as much as possible while also limiting the burden on time for participants and to \nsimplify the distinction between the intergoal constructs for participants. Intergoal facilitation \nand conflict were therefore measured independently using similar measurement techniques. \nParticipants rated the degree that their other projects facilitated their participating in regular \nphysical using a metric from 0 to 10 to rate \u201cTo what extent does each project help\/facilitate \nyour participation in regular physical activity? (Use 10 if a project helps\/facilitates you to \nparticipate in regular physical activity, and 0 if this project does not help\/facilitate you at all \nto participate in regular physical activity)\u201d for each personal project. A facilitation score was \nthen computed, composed of the mean of these facilitation ratings. The project cross-impact \nmatrix was modified to focus solely on intergoal conflict. A 10x10 matrix was composed of \nparticipants\u201f personal projects along both the rows and columns of the matrix (Presseau, \nSniehotta, Francis, & Little, 2008). Completion of the matrix proceeded in a pairwise manner \nwhere each project was compared iteratively to each other project and a rating of 0 (\u201edoes not \nconflict at all\u201f) to 10 (\u201econflicts a lot\u201f) was given to reflect \u201cto what extent does actively \nengaging in each of these projects\u2026\u201d (e.g. \u201eFinding a part-time job\u201f) \u201c\u2026conflict with \nengaging in each of these projects\u201d (e.g. \u201eGoing out with my friends\u201f). The mean rating of the \nperceived conflict that pursuing each of participants\u201f personal projects had with pursuing the \nPA project was used as the indicator of intergoal conflict.  \nFinally, participants were asked to categorise their projects into one of seven \ncategories most appropriate to describing each project, in line with standard PPA (i.e. \n 10 \nAcademic, Occupational, Health\/Body, Interpersonal, Intrapersonal, Leisure, and \nMaintenance). \nMeasures and procedure \u2013 Time 2 \nAt follow-up 8 weeks later, consenting participants were emailed a link to a short web-based \nquestionnaire which measured self-reported frequency of physical activity.  Frequency of \nparticipation in physical activity was measured using a single item scaled from \u201e0 times\u201f to \n\u201e10+ times\u201f asking \u201chow often have you participated in physical activity for at least 30 \nminutes per session during your free time in the last week?\u201d based on a validated measure \nused by Gionet and Godin (1989). An eight week span was selected for follow-up to \nmaximise the potential that projects were being actively pursued and therefore might \ninfluence participating in regular physical activity. \nResults \nDescriptive statistics and correlations \nParticipants listed a mean of 9.08 projects (sd = 1.49) during the elicitation phase, and refined \ntheir list to a mean of 7.12 projects (sd = 1.10). Besides the two personal projects added by \nthe researchers, participants rated a total of 941 projects of which 17.3% were self-\ncategorised as academic projects (e.g., \u201cattend lectures regularly\u201d), 7.0% occupational (e.g., \n\u201cwork every Friday and Saturday night\u201d), 12.2% health\/body (e.g., \u201close a further 7lbs\u201d), \n20% interpersonal (e.g., \u201cspend time with Tim\u201d), 11.4% intrapersonal (e.g., \u201cvolunteer more \nwith charities\u201d), 19.6% leisure (e.g., \u201csightseeing\u201d), and 12.5% maintenance-related (e.g., \n\u201cbecome more organised\u201d) projects. Descriptive statistics and correlations between social \ncognition scores, intergoal constructs and Time 2 self-reported behaviour are presented in \nTable 1. The median reported frequency of physical activity was 3 times in the past week, \nwith 57% of the sample reporting being physically active at least 3 times. Participants \nreported relatively strong intention, PBC, subjective norm and positive attitude towards \n 11 \nparticipating in regular physical activity. Attitude, subjective norm, and PBC were medium-\nto-strongly (Cohen, 1992) correlated with intention, in accordance with the assumptions of \nthe TPB. In line with previous research (Riediger & Freund, 2004), intergoal facilitation and \nintergoal conflict were not correlated with each other. While intergoal facilitation was \nsignificantly correlated with Time 2 behaviour and all TPB constructs, intergoal conflict was \ncorrelated with only attitude and subjective norm scores. The weight of evidence supporting \nintention and PBC as predictors of behaviour argued in favour of controlling for their effect \nbefore testing the predictive utility of intergoal constructs. However, given the lack of \ncorrelation of intergoal conflict with the main outcomes of interest in the TPB (i.e. intention \nand behaviour) subsequent analyses involving intergoal conflict focused only upon testing the \ninteraction with intention hypothesis.  \n<TABLE 1> \nDirect and moderated effects on behaviour \nA three-step hierarchical regression tested whether intergoal facilitation independently \npredicted PA behaviour beyond the TPB constructs, and whether it moderated the intention-\nbehaviour relationship. All predictors were mean-centred prior to analysis (Aiken & West, \n1991). At Step 1, the proximal predictors of the TPB (intention and PBC) were entered and \naccounted for 16.6% of the variance in Time 2 self-reported PA. Step 2 tested for a main \neffect of intergoal facilitation on behaviour, controlling for the effect of intention and PBC, \nand found that an additional 4.3% (p<.01) of the variance in behaviour was explained. Step 3 \ntested the hypothesis that intergoal facilitation moderated the intention behaviour relationship \nby adding the product term of mean centred intention and intergoal facilitation to the model. \nNo significant interaction was found (two-tailed p=.08). Hierarchical regression results \ntesting the effect of intergoal facilitation in predicting Time 2 behaviour are presented in \nTable 2.  A similar hierarchical regression testing whether intergoal conflict moderated the \n 12 \nintention-behaviour relationship did not find support for an interaction effect (\u0394R2=.006, \np=.32). \n<TABLE 2> \nMediated effect of intergoal facilitation on intention and behaviour \nTo test whether the TPB mediated the perceived facilitating effect of other projects on PA \nbehaviour, we tested two bootstrapped mediation models (Preacher & Hayes, 2008). \nBootstrapped methods were preferred for their higher statistical power over the Baron and \nKenny method and more appropriate distributional assumptions than the Sobel test \n(MacKinnon, Fairchild, & Fritz, 2007; Preacher & Hayes, 2008). \nThe first model tested whether intergoal facilitation indirectly predicted intention \nthrough the determinants of intention as proposed by the TPB (attitude, subjective norm and \nPBC). Facilitation had a significant specific indirect effect on intention through attitude \n(B=.10, BCa 95%CI2 = .05 to .20) and PBC (B= .04, BCa 95%CI= .002 to .11) but not \nsubjective norm (B= .01, BCa 95%CI -.003 to .04). A pairwise contrast between the indirect \neffect through attitude and PBC was tested to assess whether their effects were \ndistinguishable (Preacher & Hayes, 2008). They did not differ (BCa 95% CI = -.03 to .19). \nWhile the total effect (i.e. before accounting for the mediators) of facilitation on intention \nwas significant (B=.12, p<.05), the direct effect (i.e. accounting for the indirect effect of \nfacilitation on intention through attitude and PBC) was not significant. This suggests a full \nmediation (see Figure 1). \nThe second bootstrapped mediation model tested whether any observed mediation of \neffects in predicting intention continued on to predict behaviour. Intention was thus tested as \nmediator of the predictive effect of intergoal facilitation on Time 2 behaviour. A significant \nindirect effect of intergoal facilitation on Time 2 behaviour was observed (B=.08, 95%CI= \n                                               \n2 BCa 95%CI= Bias Corrected and Accelerated 95% Confidence Interval  \n 13 \n.01 to .17). The total effect of intergoal facilitation on behaviour (without accounting for the \nmediator) was significant (B=.37, p<.01). Accounting for the indirect effect through intention \nattenuated the total effect on behaviour, but not completely [B=.29, p<.01]), suggesting a \npartial mediation. \n<FIGURE 1> \nDiscussion \nPrediction of physical activity from perceived intergoal facilitation \nThe evidence from these analyses supports a significant independent effect of perceived \nintergoal facilitation on frequency of reported PA beyond TPB constructs. This main effect \nreplicates and extends Riediger and Freund\u201fs (2004) and Riediger\u201fs (2001) findings by \nsimultaneously controlling for both proximal predictors (intention and PBC) in the theory of \nplanned behaviour using a different context and different methods. Furthermore, this study \nsignificantly predicted PA at 2 months follow-up. Compared to Riediger and Freund\u201fs (2004) \nreport of observing the effect at four and five months after baseline, but not at follow-up \nmonths one, two or three, the current study suggests that intergoal facilitation predicts \nbehaviour on a shorter interval as well. The timing of this effect may largely depend on \nwhether the facilitating personal goals have been performed prior to follow-up assessment. \nBy constraining the timeframe of projects to \u201eprojects actively pursued in the next 3 months\u201f \nthis study minimised the potential for long-term projects being listed which participants may \nnot be actively pursuing at Time 2.  \nThe significant main effect of intergoal facilitation beyond behaviour-specific \nintention and PBC is compelling, as it was equivalent to the magnitude, yet independent, of \nintention. Furthermore, the size of the effect was equivalent to the additional amount of \nvariance that PBC explains in behaviour beyond intention in exercise-related TPB studies \n(Hagger et al., 2002). The facilitating effect is based on ratings from participants\u201f own \n 14 \npersonal projects rather than solely researcher-provided projects thereby considering the \nhealth behaviour of research interest as embedded within the participant\u201fs own goal system. \nThese results support the use of these meaningful idiographic assessments of individuals\u201f \nown personal projects and their perceived effect on performing a health behaviour, which can \nbe tested nomothetically using between-subjects analyses. The indirect effect of intergoal \nfacilitation on intention via attitude and PBC (albeit based on Time 1 data only) also supports \nthe idea of a motivational role for intergoal facilitation. These findings suggest that intention \nto participate in regular physical activity may be informed by attitudes and perceptions of \ncontrol that take into account the perceived facilitative effect of other personal projects. This \nsupports the assumption that the TPB constructs mediate the effect of wider contextual \nfactors such as pursuing other projects. However, the more proximal mediation model \nsuggests that the TPB only partially mediates the effect of intergoal facilitation to Time 2 \nbehaviour.  \nWhile the interaction terms did not statistically add to the regression equation, such \ninteractions are recognised as being difficult to detect in predictive studies, are often \nunderestimated, and when detected are typically of the order of magnitude observed in this \nstudy (McClelland & Judd, 1993). While it is premature to draw conclusions from the non-\nsignificant interaction between intention and perceived intergoal facilitation, implications of \nthe non-significant trend observed argue in favour of replication in a study powered to detect \nsmaller effects. \nTaken together, the findings in this study suggest that the perceived facilitative \nprojects may influence both intention to perform a health-related behaviour and its \nsubsequent performance directly and indirectly. This observed dual role may actually depend \non the nature of the personal projects that compose the investigated goal system; particular \nsubsets of projects may relate to intention and\/or behaviour more than others. The composite \n 15 \nmeasure of intergoal facilitation includes a variety of idiosyncratically defined projects. The \nperceived facilitating effect of some of these projects may directly account for additional \nvariance in reported physical activity, while others may predict cognitions and motivation to \ndo so. This implies that different aspects of the goal system may differentially affect \nmotivation and behaviour. Constraining the project elicitation phase to a context in which \nparticular types of projects are likely to be pursued may provide a way to test whether \nperceived intergoal facilitation\u201fs effect on intention and\/or behaviour is moderated by type of \nproject.  \nWhile the effect of perceived intergoal facilitation on intention was mediated by direct \nmeasures of TPB variables, an unanswered question remains regarding how intergoal \nperceptions relate to behavioural, normative and control beliefs in the TPB.  \nConceptualised as resource-related perceptions, intergoal conflict and facilitation have \nsimilarities with control beliefs. However, rather than reflecting the resources (or lack \nthereof) to perform a behaviour as do control beliefs (Ajzen, 1991), intergoal facilitation and \nconflict are perceptions of how other personal goals influence resource availability. Perceived \nfacilitating or conflicting personal goals may also influence behavioural and normative \nbeliefs about PA. Standard belief elicitation studies are unlikely to capture perceived \ninfluences of multiple goal pursuit; indeed, assessing perceived intergoal relations has been \nshown to substantially supplement belief elicitations (Presseau, Sniehotta, Francis, & \nCampbell, 2009). Nevertheless, the association between intergoal facilitation, conflict, and \nbelief-based measures in the TPB remains an empirical question that merits further \ninvestigation. \nA theoretical implication of this study\u201fs findings is that while intention remains a \nstrong determinant of future behaviour, the system of other personal goals pursued also has a \ndirect and indirect facilitative influence on enactment. This finding provides additional \n 16 \nempirical support for theoretical propositions in the literature for extending the social \ncognition models of behaviour such as the TPB to include perceptions about other goal-\ndirected behaviours performed by the individual (Abraham & Sheeran, 2003). In this sample, \nthe extent of facilitative interconnectedness of individuals\u201f goal systems was salient enough \nto participants to explain additional variance in their physical activity cognitions and \nbehaviours. The broader implication of this study is that investigating health behaviours as \nembedded within a system of multiple goal pursuit is a useful way of advancing single-\nbehaviour focused models such as the TPB. Asking individuals to list their multiple goals and \nrate how they perceive them to influence one another may be a novel experience for \nparticipants, and a potentially useful one from an intervention perspective. Simple increased \nsalience of the facilitative relations between people\u201fs projects may promote the performance \nand persistence of a health-related behaviour by allowing participants to assess how it would \nintegrate into their existing goal system (Presseau et al., 2008). This could be supplemented \nby proactive planning to promote the alignment of these facilitative relations and shield \nagainst threats to their pursuit (Darker, French, Eves, & Sniehotta, in press; Sniehotta, \nScholz, & Schwarzer, 2006).  \nThe lack of predictive utility of perceived intergoal conflict \nThe lack of correlation between intergoal facilitation and intergoal conflict supports \ntheir discriminative construct validity. Despite the intuitive appeal of intergoal conflict being \nassociated with lower physical activity levels, no such effect was found in this study, in line \nwith results from Riediger and Freund (2004). Although non-significant findings should be \ninterpreted with great caution, it is possible this may be seen as an indication that individuals \nin this study effectively self-regulate the perceived conflict between projects to minimise \ntheir impact on their intention and actual physical activity. This is consistent with the \nevidence suggesting an association between intergoal conflict and low well-being (Pomaki, \n 17 \nMaes, & ter Doest, 2004; Riediger & Freund, 2004). In other words, healthy and relatively \nactive individuals may use a number of self-regulatory strategies to minimise any persistent \nintergoal conflict in order to avoid the detriments to their subjective well-being. Thus, \nphysical activity may be well-integrated into their wider system of goal pursuit, particularly \ngiven that 57% of the sample reported being physically active at least 3 times in the past \nweek. This is consistent with Karoly et al.\u201fs (2005) findings suggesting that regular exercisers \ndo not distinguish between self-regulatory strategies used to pursue their self-identified most \nconflicting personal goal and those used for their exercise goal. This may also help to explain \nthe lack of predictive utility of intergoal conflict on exercise behaviour in Riediger and \nFreund\u201fs (2004) sample of highly motivated individuals joining an exercise gym. Intergoal \nconflict may be of higher relevance for physical activity health behaviours in more sedentary \npopulations (Gebhardt & Maes, 1998) or on those with lower self-regulatory skills. The lack \nof association may also be due to the 10x10 project cross-impact matrix used to assess \nintergoal conflict which was more complicated to complete than was the intergoal facilitation \nmeasure. Nevertheless, the direction of association of other constructs with intergoal conflict \nin the correlation matrix was negative, as expected. Furthermore, the results corroborate the \nlack of effect of intergoal conflict reported by Riediger and Freund (2004) despite use of \ndifferent measures. Future research should assess whether a simplified assessment of \nintergoal conflict improves prediction.  \nLimitations and future research \nThis study is limited by a reasonably physically active student sample whose views may not \nbe generalisable to less active samples, by the self-reported nature of the outcome variable, \nand the correlational design that limits causal conclusions. However, the novel integrative \ntheoretical principles under study justified the design choices. While the observed \nindependent predictive effect of perceived intergoal facilitation was modest, it nevertheless \n 18 \nsupports and extends existing evidence in the literature supporting this effect. Selecting \nphysical activity as the focal behaviour provides consistency with the literature, however \nfurther research is needed to corroborate the observed effects in other behavioural contexts. \nWhile bootstrapped models provided evidence of \u201cinternal replicability\u201d (Thompson, 1994, \np.171) of the mediated effects, future research should use experimental methods and, ideally, \ndifferent and objectively measured health behaviours besides physical activity to corroborate \nthe findings.  \nAggregation of individual ratings of conflict and facilitation to form a nomothetic \nscore may undermine the individual effect of a particular project, thereby resulting in a lower \noverall effect. Nevertheless, such a perspective provides an indication of the perceived \nfacilitative and conflicting effect of the goal system, which may hold greater ecological \nvalidity. Weighting of projects in terms of other factors such as relative importance may \nreconcile this measurement issue in future research.  \nMore generally, the specificity and type of projects generated by participants varied \nconsiderably between individuals. Future research should investigate the extent to which \nthese factors moderate the relationships tested in this study. \nA 2-month follow-up was selected to maximise the potential that projects were being \npursued; however some projects listed may not have been pursued until after the follow-up, \nand thus would not have influenced exercising. Nevertheless, the reverse may also be true: \nhad a follow-up of 3 months or more been selected, projects may have been altered, achieved \nor put on hold by the time the follow-up assessment was made. Future research should \ninvestigate whether these effects are dependent on the timeline of pursuit of projects when the \nfocal behaviour is measured.  \nTo ensure continuity with measures used by Armitage (2005), we did not specify a \ntimeline for the TPB items. This, along with the relatively long follow-up period, may have \n 19 \ncontributed to a lower level of variance explained in behaviour. It remains to be seen whether \nthe observed effect of intergoal facilitation is maintained with the addition of a time \nspecification when assessing TPB constructs. \nConclusions \nThis study provides evidence that perceiving a facilitating effect of other personal projects \npredicts intention to perform and performance of a health-related behaviour beyond the \nsingle-behaviour cognitive predictors in the TPB. Integrating this feature of multiple goal \npursuit into social cognition models may help to contextualise a single health-related \nbehaviour within individuals\u201f wider system of multiple goal pursuit.  \n \n \n \n \n \n 20 \nReferences \nAbraham, C., & Sheeran, P.
