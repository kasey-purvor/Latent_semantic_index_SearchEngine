INTRODUCTION\nA resonant structure in the invariant mass of  0\u0001\u00fe at\n4.43 GeV with a width of 45 MeV was recently reported by\nBelle in B! K 0\u0001 [1]. This result immediately provoked\nmuch interest from experiment and theory due to the\npossibility of it being a tetraquark candidate [2\u20136] with\nflavor c \u0001cu \u0001d or c \u0001cd \u0001u, i.e. a charmonium with isospin I \u00bc 1.\nIt has also been proposed that this structure may be due\nto subthreshold effects in D\u0002 \u0001D1 rescattering [7\u201311].\nSimilar to the X\u00f03872\u00de which is proposed to be a possible\nbound state of D \u0001D\u0002 due to long-range \u0001 exchange forces\n[12\u201314], such a mechanism will favor JP \u00bc 0\u0001, 1\u0001, or 2\u0001\nfor Z\u00f04430\u00dewith I \u00bc 1 [11]. Also, it has been suggested by\nMaiani et al. [4] that the strong coupling of the Z\u00f04430\u00de to\n 0\u0001 instead of J= \u0001 could be a signal for a radially\nexcited 1\u00fe\u0001 tetraquark. Long ago, Close and Lipkin [15]\nproposed that c \u0001c\u00fe \u0001 is a channel that could identify\ntetraquark states such as 1\u00fe\u0001 in S-wave or, most interest-\ning, 1\u0001\u0001 in P-wave, hence we shall also consider that\nZ\u00f04430\u00de !  0\u0001 occurs via P-wave transition if it has\nJPC \u00bc 1\u0001\u0001. In particular, a large coupling to  0\u0001 will\nhave special implications for its photoproduction rate,\nand information about its quantum numbers may be\nextracted.\nSeeing this state in an independent production process\nwill be essential for establishing its existence and deter-\nmining its nature. We propose here to look for the Z\u00f04430\u00de\nin photoproduction. If Z\u00f04430\u00de is a genuine signal for a\ntetraquark state which couples to  0\u0001, then it can neces-\nsarily be photoproduced via \u0001 exchange through the \u0002\u0001\n 0 intermediate coupling. It suggests that \u0002p!\nZ\u00fe\u00f04430\u00den!  0\u0001\u00fen could be a dominant production\nmechanism for Z\u00f04430\u00de. Therefore, by looking for the\nsignal of Z\u00f04430\u00de in \u0002p! Z\u00fe\u00f04430\u00den!  0\u0001\u00fen, one\nmay establish this state as a genuine resonance. We also\nestimate a possible destructive interference from the inter-\nmediate \u0002\u0001 J= coupling. Although Belle does not see\nthe decay of Z\u00f04430\u00de ! J= \u0001, which implies a weaker\nZJ= \u0001 coupling, the relatively larger leptonic width for\nJ= ! e\u00fee\u0001 than  0 ! e\u00fee\u0001 may still lead to sizable\ncontributions from intermediate J= in photoproduction.\nWe will investigate such effects in a vector meson domi-\nnance (VMD) model.\nIn addition, we consider background contributions to\nthis channel which involve Pomeron exchanges and nu-\ncleon Born terms. Interestingly, this shows that these back-\ngrounds have rather small interferences with the Z\u00fe\u00f04430\u00de\nproduction. This enhances the possibility of identifying or\nrefuting this state in photoproduction. Experimental data\nfrom DESY may be able to clarify this directly.\nIn the following we first provide a detailed description of\nthe theoretical model by considering Z\u00f04430\u00de to have\neither JP \u00bc 1\u0001, 1\u00fe, or 0\u0001. The model predictions for the\ndifferential and total cross sections will be presented. We\nthen make a quantitative analysis of the possible back-\nground contributions to  0\u0001N final state. Dalitz plot analy-\nsis will be provided.\nII. THE MODEL\nThe production of Z\u00fe in \u0002p! Z\u00fen can be described by\nthe processes in Fig. 1. Its production possesses different\n(a) (b)\nFIG. 1. Z production through meson exchange.\nPHYSICAL REVIEW D 77, 094005 (2008)\n1550-7998=2008=77(9)=094005(11) 094005-1 \u0001 2008 The American Physical Society\nfeatures at different kinematics. We outline those features\nbelow as they are essential for constructing the theoretical\nmodel:\n(I) In the t-channel, as the electromagnetic (EM) inter-\naction does not conserve isospin, the Z\u00f04430\u00de can be\nproduced by either isoscalar or isovector exchange.\nTaking into account the flavor content, i.e. Z\u00fe has a\nhidden c \u0001c which does not carry isospin, the isoscalar\nexchange in the t-channel will be forbidden for the\ncharged Z\u00f04430\u00de while suppressed for the neutral\npartner. We will come back to this point later.\nFurthermore, as the Z\u00f04430\u00de has only been seen in\nthe  0\u0001 channel, we shall concentrate on the\nt-channel pion exchange as a leading contribution.\nWe shall argue that this is likely to give a lower limit\nfor the photoproduction cross section. We note in\nadvance that the inclusion of e.g. a0 exchange will\nincrease the cross sections since there is no interfer-\nence between the pion and a0 exchange amplitudes.\nWe will present some numerical estimates for the\na0\u00f0980\u00de exchange later. Heavier t-channel meson\n(Regge) exchanges contribute to the cross section\nat off-forward angles and could become important in\nthe higher energy region. As we do not have infor-\nmation about their couplings to Z\u00f04430\u00de 0, we shall\nfocus on the near-threshold region where the domi-\nnant pion exchange can be well constrained and\nreliably estimated.\n(II) For JP \u00bc 1\u0001 and 0\u0001, Z\u00f04430\u00de will couple to VP in\nP-wave at leading order, while for JP \u00bc 1\u00fe, it is via\nS-wave. We apply different effective Lagrangians to\ndescribe the Z 0\u0001 vertex.\n(III) There is no available information about the coupling\nfor a Z to nucleons. This will appear in the s or\nu-channel where Z\u00f04430\u00de can directly couple to p\nand n. The s-channel process generally becomes\nimportant near threshold, and at middle and back-\nward scattering angles. With increasing energies,\nthese contributions die out quickly due to the sup-\npression of the s and u-channel propagators and the\neffects of the nucleon\u2019s form factors. In contrast, the\nt-channel pion exchange may remain dominant at\nforward angles and give the major contribution to the\ncross section.\nBased on the above rather general considerations,\nwe identify processes that will drive the Z\u00f04430\u00de\nproduction. As the Z\u00f04430\u00de is observed to couple\nstrongly to  0\u0001, we propose to look for signals\nin \u0002p!Z\u00fe\u00f04430\u00den! 0\u0001\u00fen, and \u0002p!\nZ0\u00f04430\u00dep! 0\u00010p. This gives rise to some back-\nground contributions as shown in Fig. 2, in particu-\nlar, in the neutral Z\u00f04430\u00de production.\n(IV) As the Z\u00f04430\u00de is observed to couple to  0\u0001, we\nderive the Z\u0002\u0001 coupling by vector meson domi-\nnance (VMD), and assume that the Z\u0002\u0001 coupling is\ndue to a sum of intermediate vector mesons which\nconnect the photon with the Z\u00f04430\u00de and the ex-\nchanged \u0001. We initially assume that  0 is the domi-\nnant intermediate vector meson in the Z\u0002\u0001\ncoupling, and then consider the possible effect of a\ncoupling to J= \u0001.\nA.

As\nthis is larger than for the  0, it is possible that any coupling\nZ! J= \u0001 could cause an additional contribution to the\nphotoproduction amplitude, which could destructively in-\nterfere with the former and hence give a much reduced\ncross section. If this were the case, it would also imply that\na branching ratio Z! J= \u0001 should be visible.

PHYSICAL REVIEW D 77, 094005 (2008)\n094005-3\nFor neutral Z production contributions may also be\nallowed from Pomeron exchange. However, we argue\nthat this scenario is suppressed due to the following rea-\nsons: (i) In the case where the photon (isoscalar compo-\nnent) couples to c \u0001c, isospin has to be transferred to the pair\nof light q \u0001q in order to form Z0\u00f04430\u00de. (ii) The photon can\ncouple to isovector vector mesons made of light q \u0001q, which\nthen pull out a pair of c \u0001c after exchanging a Pomeron.\nAlthough this process conserves isospin, it is suppressed by\nthe soft creation of a large mass c \u0001c, and also as it requires\nthe Z meson to be formed with the q \u0001q and c \u0001c pairs at\nrelatively large momentum transfers. Consequently, sup-\npression from the final state wave function is likely. Precise\nestimates will be model dependent but for the purpose of\nestimating a lower limit for the production cross section,\nwe neglect this contribution here.\nIn contrast, Pomeron contributions can generate back-\nground. As shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), the direct pro-\nduction of  0 allows Pomeron exchanges as an important\nproduction mechanism. An intermediate nucleon will then\ndecay into a pion and nucleon. In principle, all the inter-\nmediate isospin 1=2 nucleon resonances can contribute to\nthis process. Again, as a simple estimate of the back-\nground, we only consider the nucleon pole contributions.\nB.

Numerical results for \u0001p! Z\u00fen\nIn Figs. 3\u20135, the differential and total cross sections are\nplotted for JP \u00bc 1\u0001, 1\u00fe, and 0\u0001, respectively. The photon\nXIAO-HAI LIU, QIANG ZHAO, AND FRANK E. CLOSE PHYSICAL REVIEW D 77, 094005 (2008)\n094005-4\nenergy for the differential cross sections is E\u0002 \u00bc 30 GeV\n(W \u00bc 7:56 GeV), which corresponds to the peaking en-\nergy region in the total cross sections. In all three cases, the\nforward peaking turns to be a prominent feature in the\ndifferential cross sections due to the pion exchange.\nThe results of Figs. 3\u20135 show compatible production\ncross sections for those three spin-parity assignments. For\nspin-parity 1\u0001 and 1\u00fe, their production cross sections have\nthe same expression in the real photon limit as noted\nbefore. The difference between Figs. 3 and 4 arises from\nthe different coupling strengths for gZ 0\u0001 extracted from\nZ\u00fe !  0\u0001\u00fe.\nThe cross section for 0\u0001 production is found larger than\nthe other two assignments. This is understandable by com-\nparing Eqs. (11), (15), and (20) with each other. It also\nshows that, in order to determine the quantum numbers,\nmeasurement of the angular distributions of Z!  0\u0001 is\nnecessary. For spin-parity 1\u00fe, the decay will be via relative\nS-wave between  0\u0001, while it is via relative P-wave for 1\u0001\nand 0\u0001. Therefore, an observation of P-wave decay will\nrequire further studies such as polarization observables to\ndetermine the quantum numbers of Z\u00f04430\u00de.\nFor 0\u0001, a0 exchange is forbidden and the pion exchange\nis the exclusive leading contribution. For other JP a0 could\ncontribute but in practice need not concern us here. Even\nwere its coupling as large as that of the pion, gZ 0a0 \u00bc\ngZ 0\u0001, its contribution to the cross section is negligible (in\nFigs. 3 and 4, the results due to t-channel a0 exchanges are\npresented by the dotted curves). This in practice allows us\nto focus on the pion exchange mechanism in the photo-\nproduction reaction as a reliable estimate of the lower\nbound of the production cross sections.\nBecause of the pion exchange, the energy dependence of\nthe total cross sections exhibits a strong threshold enhance-\nment in \u0002p! Z\u00fen. It is similar to the charged \b meson\nproduction near threshold where the charged pion ex-\nchange (unnatural parity exchange) also plays a dominant\nrole [23,24]. However, such a threshold enhancement\nseems to be absent in charmonium production, such as\nJ= and  0 [25,26]. This may be due to the dominance\nof the diffractive process which submerges the contribu-\ntions from t-channel unnatural parity exchanges. Although\nJ= has a relatively large coupling to \b\u0001, whereby\nt-channel pion exchange turns to be important in \u0002p!\nJ= p, the coupling is not as large as that for Z 0\u0001.\nConsequently, the predicted threshold enhancement in Z\nmeson photoproduction is strongly driven by the large\nZ 0\u0001 coupling.\nOur main concern therefore is the possibility of some\nfurther contribution that is large and destructive.

J= \u0001 decay, which allows an\nestimate of x \t 0:1, and with which the total cross section\nwould be still sizable.\nIf the Z meson is a genuine resonance, the threshold\nenhancement will be a signature for its existence. This can\nbe further clarified by the study of background effects in\n\u0002p!  0\u0001\u00fen in the next section.\nIII. BACKGROUND ANALYSIS\nExperimentally, the final state particles identified are  0,\n\u0001, and nucleon. As a result, background contributions to\nthe  0\u0001N channel can interfere with the transitions we are\ninterested in. As discussed earlier, one of the major con-\ntributions is due to the diffractive production of  0 (Fig. 2).\nIn this section, we combine \u0002p! Z\u00fen!  0\u0001\u00fen and\n\u0002p!  0p!  0\u0001\u00fen together to make an estimate of the\nsignal and background contributions. This could be useful\nfor experimental search for the Z\u00fe in this channel. Since\nthe production rate for all these three spin parities are\nsimilar, we only consider JP \u00bc 1\u0001 in the following\nanalysis.\nThe schematic transition diagrams are illustrated in\nFig. 2. We first extend the formulas of the previous section\nto \u0002p! Z\u00fen!  0\u0001\u00fen, and then include the diffractive\ncontributions from the Pomeron exchanges.\nA.

We note that these parameters lead to a reasonable\ndescription of both J= and  0 photoproduction in com-\nparison with the experiment [31].\nAs shown by the total production cross section for \u0002p!\nZ\u00fen, the largest cross section is at W \u2019 8 GeV\u00f0E\u0002 \u2019\n34 GeV\u00de. We thus take this energy as an input to simulate\nthe invariant mass spectrum for \u0002p!  0\u0001\u00fen. This could\nbe the kinematic region which favors the separation of the\nZ\u00fe signals.\nIn Fig. 6, we calculate the total cross sections for \u0002p!\n 0\u0001\u00fen including both signal and background contribu-\ntions. As shown by the solid curve, the overall production\ncross section has a quick increase just above threshold and\nis dominated by the Z\u00fe production as shown by the dotted\ncurve. In contrast, the background contributions from the\nPomeron exchange are relatively small and do not vary\ndrastically with the increasing energies at W > 20 GeV.\nThis is consistent with the familiar diffractive behavior in\nvector meson photoproduction.\nThe steep rise of the cross section near threshold turns\nout to be very different from other known heavy vector\nphotoproductions, such as \f, J= , and  0. In those cases,\nthe threshold cross sections are rather smooth and no\nthreshold enhancement has been observed. In the produc-\ntion of Z\u00fe\u00f04430\u00de, its strong coupling to  0\u0001 gives rise to\nthe predominant contributions from pion exchange. Note\nthat  0 ! e\u00fee\u0001 is also strong. These lead to an unusual\nprediction for its cross section near threshold.\nIt is more constructive to inspect the Dalitz plot for the\nthree-body final state. We take a sample of the events at\nW \u00bc 8 and 12 GeV, respectively. As shown by Fig. 7, a\nclear band appears in the invariant mass spectrum of  0\u0001\ndue to the Z resonance. Although we do not include the s\nand u channel nucleon resonances, their contributions\nseem not to demolish the Z\u00f04430\u00de band since their effects\nwill add to the plot horizontally and in the lowM2n\u0001 region,\ne.g. M2n\u0001 < 5 GeV\n2.\nWith the increasing center-mass energy, the background\nfrom Pomeron exchange becomes important, and the\nZ\u00f04430\u00de signals are submerged as shown by Fig. 8.\nFor the neutral Z0\u00f04430\u00de production, the leading back-\nground contribution is the same as the charged Z produc-\ntion. In the t-channel Z0 production, an additional\ntransition is the diffractive production of Z0 via Pomeron\nexchange for 1\u0001 or odderon exchange for 1\u00fe. It gives rise\nto two possibilities as shown in Fig. 9. In Fig. 9(a), the\ninitial photon couples to the isoscalar component of a\nvector meson (c \u0001c), which then couples to Z0 by projecting\nthe c \u0001c component to the I \u00bc 1 tetraquark wave function.\nNote that the exchange of Pomeron or odderon does not\ncompensate the isospin. This process will be suppressed\ndue to isospin violation. The other diffractive transition is\nthat the initial photon couples to the isovector component\nof the intermediate meson as shown by Fig. 9(b). For the\ntetraquark scenario, the isovector component must be from\nthe light q \u0001q instead of c \u0001c, hence requiring creation of a pair\nof c \u0001c from the vacuum which then couples to the I \u00bc 1\ntetraquark wave function. Note that the c \u0001c pair is much\nheavier than the light q \u0001q. To form a tetraquark of cq \u0001c \u0001q , it\nneeds a sizable overlap between the final state Z0 and the\nintermediate isovector q \u0001q. Since the c \u0001c is much heavier\nthan the light q \u0001q, the Z0 wave function overlap with the c \u0001c\nand light q \u0001q should be small. This allows us to neglect the\nFIG. 6 (color online). Energy dependence of total cross section\nfor \u0002p!  0\u0001\u00fen. W is the c.m. energy.

Because of the\nabove argument, the neutral Z0 photoproduction turns out\nto be similar to the charged Z production studied earlier.\nThe neutral Z0 of 0\u0001 assignment leads to production of\nexotic quantum number 0\u0001\u0001. If indeed the Z0\u00f04430\u00de !\n 0\u00010 has a partial width of\n45 MeV, its photoproduction\ncross section near threshold will also be significant. By\nmeasuring the angular distribution of Z0 !  0\u00010, its quan-\ntum numbers can also be determined.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn this work we have made a detailed analysis of the\nphotoproduction reaction \u0002p! Z\u00fe\u00f04430\u00den in an effective\nLagrangian approach for possible assignments of JP \u00bc 1\u0001,\n1\u00fe, and 0\u0001 to the Z0\u00f04430\u00de. As suggested by the observa-\ntion of Belle, we show that the t-channel pion exchange is\nan important production mechanism for creating Z\u00fe\u00f04430\u00de\nat the rate of several tens of nanobarn. In this process the\n\u0001NN coupling can be well constrained and the Z\u0002\u0001\ncoupling can be extracted from the Z 0\u0001 data via VMD\nmodel.\nWe have also checked the possible effect of t-channel a0\nexchange. We find its contributions are relatively small\neven if, as an upper limit, we fix the Z 0a0 coupling to\nbe the same as gZ 0\u0001. Since there is no interference be-\ntween the a0 and pion exchange amplitudes, we can ne-\nglect the a0 exchange in the calculation and only adopt the\nrelatively well-defined pion exchange for estimating the\nlower bound of the Z\u00f04430\u00de photoproduction cross sec-\ntions. We find that, due to pion exchange, a clear threshold\nenhancement is predicted for Z\u00f04430\u00de photoproduction,\nwhich is different from photoproduction of J= and  0\nnear threshold, and could be a signature for the Z\u00f04430\u00de\nexistence. This is also the kinematic region that uncertain-\nties arising from other unknown processes can be over-\nlooked as a reasonable approximate.\nWe also consider possible background contributions to\nthe signals in \u0002p!  0\u0001\u00fen, where the diffractive produc-\ntion of  0 turns to be the leading source. Interestingly, it\nshows that the interferences from the background terms are\nrather small. In the Dalitz plot at W \u00bc 8 GeV (E\u0002 \u2019\n34 GeV), a clear band of the Z meson signals appear in\nthe invariant mass spectrum of  0\u0001. Similar results are\nobtained for the neutral production channel. For other\nbackground contributions from diffractive transitions, we\nargue that they may be suppressed by isospin conservation\nand momentummismatching. Although nucleon resonance\ncontributions to the background in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) have\nnot been included in this calculation, their effects are\nunlikely to submerge the Z\u00f04430\u00de band in the Dalitz plot.\nThe reason is that the nucleon resonance cross sections will\naccumulate horizontally in a form of uneven bands, and be\nlocated at M2n\u0001 < 5 GeV\n2. In the kinematics of higher\nM2n\u0001 interferences from the nucleon resonances are ex-\npected to be negligible. As a consequence, the Z\u00f04430\u00de\nproduction signals can be rather cleanly isolated from the\nbackground, and the measurement of the angular distribu-\ntions between  0 and \u0001 will tell whether they are in a\nrelative S or P wave. The quantum numbers of the Z\u00f04430\u00de\ncan thus be determined.\nIn summary, in order to establish the Z\u00f04430\u00de as a\nconcrete candidate of tetraquark state and determine its\nquantum numbers, further search for its signals in other\nFIG. 9.
