Many media scholars have seen in the \nrise of press and broadcast media a shift in which 'the classic community of publics is \nbeing transformed into a society of masses' (Mills, 1956: 300).  As Mills says, much \nof our understanding of democratic processes depends on the idea of a public or \npublics: \nIn a public, as we may understand the term, 1) virtually as many people express opinions \nas receive them. (2) Public communications are so organized that there is a chance \nimmediately and effectively to answer back any opinion expressed in public.  Opinion \nformed by such discussion (3) readily finds an outlet in effective action, even against \u2013 if \nnecessary \u2013 the prevailing system of authority.  And (4) authoritative institutions do not \npenetrate the public, which is more or less autonomous in its operations (Mills, 1956: \n303-4) \n \nIn contrast, in a mass (and in mass media), only a few people get to express opinions, \nthere is limited feedback, the discussions lead to no action, or to carefully channelled \nactions, and the forums of discussion are controlled by the authorities (see also \nHabermas, 1991 [1962]: 249).  Enthusiasts for blogs have argued they satisfy criterion \n(3) for a real public, when they bring down a powerful Member of Congress or \ncoordinate a presidential campaign, and the enthusiasts celebrate blogs' independence \nof government and mainstream media institutions (criterion 4).  Whether they are in \nfact so effective and independent, I will leave to other studies.  But they certainly do \nallow as many people to express opinions as receive them (criterion 1), since almost \nanyone with an internet connection to read a blog could also write one.  And most \nblogs make it easy to answer back by posting comments (criterion 2).  They seem to \nfit some of the demands for a public sphere (see also Fairclough, 2000; Wodak & \nWright, 2006). \nAfter ten years of blogging, critical media analysts have reason to feel \ndisenchanted.  The problems are not to do with the technical affordances of \naccessibility or feedback, but with the way discussion takes place in this forum. \nThough anyone can express an opinion, a few well-known blogs get most of the \n3 \n \nattention, and postings from the mass of bloggers come to wider notice only when \nthey are picked out by one of the 'A-list'. Though anyone can respond, comments also \nlead to flaming, trolling, and threadjacking (turning a discussion to one\u201fs own \nhobbyhorse).  Blogs are just as likely to spread unfounded rumours as to give \nchannels for progressive action. And while they are proudly independent of \nmainstream media, they are not independent of prevailing ideologies and \ninstitutionally-organised campaigns. \n One component of all these problems is the perceived need in the blogosphere \nto present oneself as an individual with entitlement to an opinion.  I will argue that the \nbloggers, and commenters on blogs, in my sample are constantly concerned with self \npresentation, positioning themselves on a crowded terrain of other bloggers and \ncommenters.  The emphasis on individual voice and perspective makes for some \nengaging writing, and it may have its own beneficial political role to play.  But it does \nnot have the focus on a shared social project that would be needed for deliberative \ndiscussion.  It is not the same as participatory citizenship. \n In this paper, I would like to look in detail at the act of marking that a \nstatement in a blog or comment is an individual perspective.  The linguistic features \nthat particularly interest me are those used in stance-taking ((Biber & Finegan, 1989; \nClift, 2006; DuBois, 2007; Jaffe, 2009).  Here is one influential definition of the term \nstance:  \nStance is a public act by a social actor, achieved dialogically through overt \ncommunicative means, of simultaneously evaluating objects, positioning subjects, and \naligning with other subjects, with respect to any salient dimensions of the sociocultural \nfield (DuBois 2007: 220). \n \nThis broad term covers a range of linguistic features that have long been studied \nseparately, such as modality, evaluation, evidentiality, hedging, politeness, or \nmetadiscourse.  The advantage of taking them together, following DuBois's definition, \n4 \n \nis that stance-taking focuses our attention of the 'public act' of taking a point of view \nrather than on one or another specific grammatical or discourse form.  So stance-\ntaking does not just involve having an opinion on a topic; it involves using that \nopinion to align with or disalign with someone else. I have illustrated elsewhere some \nof the range of stance devices used in blogs (Myers, 2009: Ch. 6).  Here I will take a \ndifferent approach, and start with the particular linguistic items, such as cognitive \nverbs and a specific use of adverbs, that stand out in my corpus in comparison to a \nreference corpus.  Besides these common stance-marking items, there are ways of \nstance-taking that are not signalled by any specific linguistic feature, so I will discuss \none of the devices \u2013 ironic quotation \u2013 that is particularly common in blog comments. \nData and Methods \nBloggers argue about many issues, from bread recipes to cosmology, but I \nhave focused here on discussions of what could be considered public issues.  I have \nbroadened the discussion to include the on-line comments (where the blogger enables \nthem) as well as the original posts.  Though the bloggers get the attention, public \ndiscussion in the blogosphere is as much in the comments as in the blogs.  And \ncomments on the more popular blogs give a wider range of participation than do blogs \nthemselves;  anyone can post (subject to registration and\/or moderation in some \ncases), and their words will be seen by a much larger number of readers than they \nwould be if each commenter just posted them on their own (mostly ignored) blog.  I \nhave chosen five blogs that are current and popular and have many comments: \n Michelle Malkin (http:\/\/michellemalkin.com\/)and Yglesias \n(http:\/\/yglesias.thinkprogress.org\/) are two well-known US blogs, of the right and \nleft respectively; both are in Technorati's list of the 100 most popular blogs, based \non how many other blogs link to them.   \n5 \n \n Bitch PhD (http:\/\/bitchphd.blogspot.com\/) and Sepia Mutiny \n(http:\/\/www.sepiamutiny.com\/sepia\/) both have several writers, and considerable \nreaderships for a more focused range of topics.  Bitch PhD is no longer just about \nthe one eponymous academic;  it deals with a range of issues from a feminist \nperspective.  Sepia Mutiny is written by a collective of young people of South \nAsian origin (they use the term desis) living in the US, on such topics as their \nsocial lives, Asian celebrities and businesses, politics, careers, and families. \n Going Underground (http:\/\/london-underground.blogspot.com\/), an award-\nwinning blog by Annie Mole, has posts on all sorts of topics relevant in some way \nto the London transport system, from fashions seen on platforms to movie scenes \nset in the underground.  I include it here because even a special-interest blog takes \nup public issues, in this case fares and safety. \nIn all these five blogs, the bloggers post daily and many commenters respond \nwithin that day, sometimes writing about the original entry, sometimes about other \nblogs, and sometimes with no discernable relevance to anything.  Typically the \nthreads tend to fray over time, leading on to other discussions, either because of a \ndeliberate deviation from the topic by one commenter, or because of the gradual \nmutation of one topic into another.  For each blog, I started on the same day (23 \nOctober 2009) and collected posts and comments until I had more than 10,000 words \nof that blog.  So this half of my sample was about 50,000 words, in a file I named \n'allblogs'. \nI took the other half of my sample \u2013 another 50,000 words, roughly \u2013 from a \nrather different kind of web discussion site. Metafilter (http:\/\/www.metafilter.com\/) \nwas one of the first popular applications of blogging software, developed by Matthew \nHaughey in 1999 to enable members to post short comments with links to a front \n6 \n \npage, which are then the starting point for comments by other members.  There is a \nstrong sense of community and of a shared project around the discussions on \nMetafilter.  It can be seen as a community of practice (Barton & Tusting, 2005; \nWenger, 1998), for instance in the way new contributors are asked to pass through an \napprenticeship, reading and engaging in limited participation to learn the norms of the \ncommunity before posting a topic for discussion.  So the discussions often have a kind \nof witty and controlled interplay, even when there are fierce and even rude \ndisagreements, and those norms affect the prevailing styles of stance-taking. \nTo analyse these corpora, I used Wmatrix, a corpus concordance tool \ndeveloped by Paul Rayson.\n2\n  A corpus concordance tool gives the frequency of words \nin the texts, but that frequency is not in itself interesting for our purposes;  the most \nfrequent words in a large corpus are likely to be the most frequent words in any \nsample of English: the, a, is and so on. A keyword is a word that is relatively more \nfrequent in this corpus than in a reference corpus to which one is comparing it, so it \nsays something about what is distinctive in this corpus, for instance about blogs in \ncomparison to writing in general.  In my study, the reference corpus was a sampler of \nthe written sub-corpora of the British National Corpus (http:\/\/www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk\/). \nWmatrix lists the keywords, not in the order of frequency, but in the order of the \nstatistical significance of their relative over-use, as measured by log likelihood.  A log \nlikelihood of over 15.13 (the cut-off I used for consideration in my study) means that \nthe difference is extremely unlikely to be attributable to chance.\n3 \nMany of the keywords are just what one would expect, because they are the \ncontent words associated with the topic discussed, which will not be as common in a \nlarger sample of texts (for instance, Bakerloo in Going Underground, or desi in Sepia \nMutiny), or the strings used uniquely on blogs, such as date stamps.  Some keywords \n7 \n \nare clearly central to the function of blogs, so central that an analyst might not notice \nthem without the corpus tool to point them out.   \nI started my analysis with stance markers that occur in the list of keywords, \nrather than with a broader checklist of features of modality and evaluation, because \nthere is too much danger for a discourse analyst, with blogs especially, of picking out \nexamples to illustrate their point while missing the overall character of the corpus.  \nThe examples that stand out in the first qualitative coding of texts are usually those \nthat are unusual and striking in some way.  The lure of the neat example is \nparticularly problematic for such a heterogeneous and polyvocal corpus as this one \u2013 \nheterogeneous in that there are many writers, and polyvocal in that each can choose \none or more of a range of possible voices, echoing, ironicising, or earnestly affirming.   \nThere are several concordancers that one could use for this analysis; I used \nWmatrix because, besides giving word frequencies, it also tags every word for \ngrammatical word class (part of speech), with reasonable accuracy, using the CLAWS \nprobabilistic tagging tool, and it also tags them for semantic groups, using the \ncategories in the UCREL Semantic Analysis System (USAS).  The individual \nkeywords are the basis of my argument, but I sometimes use these broader tags to \ncheck on the keywords, to find if there were other words used in similar ways, for \ninstance, to go from the use of actually to the wider category of stance adverbs. \nKeywords do not tell the whole story, because of course the same string of \ncharacters can have several different uses besides stance taking; there are indeed no \nwords or word classes that function solely to mark stance.  So the next stage is to take \neach string marked as a keyword that could be a stance marker and look at it in a \nconcordance, a list of the occurrences of the string with the context on either side, to \n8 \n \nsee how they are being used.  I think, for instance, can be used in ways that mark \nstance: \nI think\n4,\n however, that this is often a point of friction in friendship between \nwhites and poc in the US. [Bitch PhD;  'poc' here is 'people of color'] \nThis usage marks stance because the embedded statement ('this is often a point of \nfriction . . .') is presented as the point of view of the writer.  But I think can also be \nused in ways that do not mark stance: \nI think about black women's hair quite a lot. [Bitch PhD] \nThis is not stance, because think here is used in the sense of having something on \none's mind, as in 'Don't think of elephants', not in the sense of taking a stance on \nsomething, such as black women's hair.  And even when the I think is certainly \nmarking stance, for instance, signalling the degree of commitment of the writer, the \neffect or marking the statement as a point of view can be to weaken it (it's just my \nview) or strengthen it (I have a right to my opinion and experience).   \nThese complexities might make it seem impossible for an analyst to tell when \nsomeone is taking a stance.  But stance-taking is, as DuBois reminds us, a public act, \nnot a private cognitive state (DuBois, 2007), so there should be evidence in the text of \nwhat is being signalled and, often, of how the readers interpret those signals in \ncontext. \nDiscussion and stance-taking \n Though I argue that individual stance-taking takes precedence over discussion, \nI do not deny that discussion is going on.  Besides the stance markers I will study, the \nlist of keywords for the 'allblogs' corpus, compared to the BNC Written Sampler, \nincludes because, why, so, bias, question, admit, misleading, connection, and \nunderstand.  All of these could be (and mostly are, on examination of the \n9 \n \nconcordances) words used in arguing and responding to other arguments. If we turn to \nthe most frequent semantic tags in the USAS categories, we find heavy use of such \ncategories as 'Thought and Belief', 'Cause and Effect \/ Connection', 'If', 'Comparing:  \nSimilar\/different', 'Evaluation', and 'Negative', all of which are categories used in \nrhetorical structure (Mann & Thompson, 1988).  But I will not be looking at content \nof the arguments or their abstract form (for examples of argument construction in \ncomputer-mediated communication, see Gurak, Antonijevic, Johnson, Ratliff, & \nReyman, 2004; Wodak & Wright, 2006).  I will focus on the specific words they use \nto indicate they are taking a stance in a discussion, especially cognitive verbs, stance \nadverbs, and conversational particles, because they can tell us what sort of discussion \nthese writers signal that they are entering. \nCognitive verbs \nPerhaps the clearest way to mark that a stance is a stance is with a verb of \ncognition (I think), affect (I feel), or appearance (it seems), followed by a clause \ncomplement.   \nI guess she means we don't own the banks.  (Sepia Mutiny) \n'We don't own the banks' is a statement about the world.  'She means' attributes this \nview to his mother.  'I guess' marks all of this as a stance, in this case, something the \nwriter is not entirely certain about.  And the stance marker typically comes first \n(though it does not have to), so it serves as a condition while reading what follows \n(Biber, Johansson, Leech, Conrad, & Finegan, 1999: 971).  The example sentence \nwould have a different effect if 'I guess' were moved to the end, as an afterthought.  \nCognitive verbs are salient in my corpus of blogs because they are, apparently, \nunnecessary: what one writes is what one thinks even if one does not say so.  The \nstance marker makes a public act of taking a stance, and it can show, for instance, the \n10 \n \nkind of subtle gradations of commitment conveyed by I guess, which is not the same \nas I think or I know. \nThe list of keywords for the blogs, when compared to the BNC written corpus, \nincludes several cognitive verbs (Table 1). \n [Table 1 about here] \nThis table shows that seven cognitive verbs are much more common in the sample of \nblogs than one would expect in a sample of written language. Note that this is not the \nsame as saying that they are high in the raw frequency count.  Realize, for instance, \nonly occurs twice per thousand words, 14 times in the whole 'allblogs' corpus.  But it \noccurs much less frequently in the BNC, so it is listed as a key word.  Understand is \nsomewhat more common in the 'allblogs' corpus, with 26 occurrences, but it is also \nfairly frequent in the BNC, so it has a lower (but still significant) log likelihood. \nThe verb that is most salient for my purposes, both in terms of frequency and \nin terms of keyness, is think.  The semantic category 'Thought and Belief', which \nincludes nouns such as attitudes and judgment as well as verbs, has 632 occurrences \nin the blogs, and think accounts for 215 of them.  But as I have noted, think is used in \nmany kinds of discourse acts, and not all these occurrences mark stance.  To find out \nwhat I think is doing in 'allblogs', we need to look at the concordance.  The sample in \nFigure 1. gives an impression of how stance marking occurs alongside other uses.   \n[Figure 1 around here] \nNine of the twenty instances shown in this figure are straightforwardly marking the \nwriter's stance:   \n I don't think all white people have the same hair \nFour of the instances attribute a stance to someone else: \n They think they know what the world is like \n11 \n \nAnd seven are not, by the definition used here, marking stance at all; they are \ndescribing or demanding an act of cognition: \n Think before you make any comments \nThe proportions in this tiny bit of the concordance are typical of the list as a whole; \nthat is, more than half the uses of cognitive verbs are marking the stance of the writer \nor attributing a stance to someone else. \nBut what are bloggers and commenters doing by marking stance?  As one \nmight expect, some uses soften advice or disagreement: \nSometimes I think a huge part of parenting is learning to live with feeling \noverwhelmed. Over the years we get more graceful about it: easier on \nourselves and our kids. (Bitch PhD) \nMcmama, I think the point isn't that the curiosity itself is racist. (Bitch PhD) \nIn the first of these examples, a commenter advising a harassed parent first says that \nthis view is one she has only some of the time, and then frames it with a cognitive \nverb so that the general advice is just her opinion.  In the second example, I think \nsuggests a clarification, with the implicit suggestion that Mcmama, another \ncommenter, has missed the point of the post.    \nBecause a statement introduced in this way lays no claim to certainty, it can be \nused in parallel constructions to introduce two contradictory possibilities: \nI 'd like to  think  it was a result of my good looks and charm , but really I  \nthink  it 's just the power of Bollywood. (Sepia Mutiny) \nMost examples are in first person, but think can also be used to attribute hypothetical \nstances that the writer implies cannot be sustainable: \nSlap Factory, do you think it's right for news anchors (not opinion, news) to \nrepeatedly advertise one political protest to the exclusion of all others? Do you \n12 \n \nreally think that's something you would see on a CNN or MSNBC newscast? \n(Metafilter) \nThese are rhetorical questions; it seems unlikely that Slap Factory will respond that \nthey do believe in news anchors advertising a protest.  In several of the examples I \nhave quoted (and in 10 of the 215 instances in the concordance), the explicit marking \nof stance with I think co-occurs with an explicit marking of addressee (Mcmama, Slap \nFactory). Even where the addressee is not marked, they are there by implication, as \npotentially holding a different stance.   \n There are many other verbs (and nouns) to express cognitive processes, but \nvariations like I guess and I believe tend to be used by one writer or in one post. I \nthink is common across the \u201eallblogs\u201f corpus.  It less common in Going Underground \nand Metafilter, and that is consistent with the difference in tone between those two \nsubcorpora and others in my corpus.  Though I think can be used to hedge as well as \nto strengthen (K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen, 2003), as it does in other genres, in the blogs it seems to \ncorrelate with more heated adversarial arguments. \nConclusion 1:  Cognitive verbs are used mainly to signal a relation to another \nperson or persons, rather than to do their literal task of marking epistemic \nuncertainty.  \nStance Adverbs \nAs I have noted, Wmatrix tags word classes (parts of speech), and one of the \nmost over-used word class tags is that for adverbs (the tag RR, log likelihood 224).  It \nmay seem impossible to explain the relative frequency of occurrences of items for \nsuch a broad class (Biber & Finegan, 1988; Tseronis, 2009).  But it is worth noting \nthat many of the keywords in this category can function as boosters: totally, really, \ndefinitely, absolutely, completely.   One might expect the use of boosters in the \n13 \n \npolemical atmosphere of blog discussions, as in this post (about a pay claim made by \ndrivers on the underground): \nI would really, really, really like to hear a defence of this, because I just can't \nthink of one. (Going Underground) \nBut these adverbs have other functions besides boosting.  They can be used (9 of 100 \ninstances in 'allblogs', 5 of 17 in Metafilter), in one-word phrases, usually before a \ncomma, full stop, or question mark, to suggest a sceptical response to something said \nearlier:  \nFor instance, can someone think manmade global warming is a serious threat, \nbut still be considered to be in favor of limited government? \n Of course. Really. (Malkin) \nThe passage the commenter quotes is presumably meant as a rhetorical question.  \nInstead of giving what is suggested as the only possible answer, no, the commenter \nsays 'of course'.  The 'Really' marks this response as a stance, implying that the \nopponent might think it was a joke. This kind of response to others accounts for \nfrequent use of really with a question mark, to express doubt or surprise about what \nwas just said: \nReally? Name one time conservatives had a protest against the behemoth \nMedicare expansion. (Malkin) \nWalker Percy is from Alabama? Really? godDAMMIT WHERE IS THAT \nBOURBON. (Metafilter) \nThe hate for William Tecumseh Sherman, who was frankly a hero \nReally? (Metafilter) \nBubble? From the guy who thinks Fox News is only as bad as the other media \noutlets? Really? (Metafilter) \n14 \n \nThese usages do not so much express their skepticism as enact it, as if the writers \nwere taken aback in conversation.  This usage is particularly common in Metafilter, \nwhere participants prefer very short, witty ripostes.   \nOne particularly over-used adverb, actually, nearly always functions to \nposition a statement as a contrast to some other statement or expectation, particularly \nwhen it occurs at the beginning of the sentence (and the comment): \nActually, we don\u201ft have a huge problem with moderate Republicans. It\u201fs the \nLIBERAL Republicans we can\u201ft stand. (Malkin) \nActually, there are lot of largish metros mysteriously absent here. (Yglesias) \nActually, I have to disagree, kmz. It IS necessary to eat sushi. (Metafilter) \nActually, this could be pretty useful to set up last-minute after-work happy-\nhour type stuff without having to resort to mass e-mails or text-messages. \n(Sepia Mutiny) \nIn the first three examples, the commenter is marking a contrast with what was said in \nan earlier post.  In the last, the contrast is with what the author herself might have \nthought before about the usefulness of this new social networking site.  The \ncontrastive use of actually is a useful device in rhetoric of blog commenters.  Like I \nthink, it is apparently and conventionally polite, mitigating possible disagreement.  \nBut it also implies the groundlessness of the view to which one is responding.  The \ncontrast suggests that what one as to say is worth attention, because one is adding \nsomething new and unexpected to the discussion.   \nConclusion 2:  Adverbs, especially when used at the beginning of a comment, can \nsignal a contrastive relation to previous comments. \n15 \n \nConversational particles \n It is often observed that various on-line genres use features more associated \nwith speech than writing (Crystal, 2006; Yates, 1996).  But this does not mean that \nbloggers and others are just following the conventions of an on-line register.  They \ncould be choosing features appropriate to the interpersonal rhetoric of this genre, and \nthus using features that are also more likely to be associated with face-to-face \ncommunication.  For instance, I think is a keyword when the blogs are compared to \nthe BNC Written Sampler, but not when compared to the BNC Spoken sampler.  The \nbloggers are not trying to imitate the sound of speech, but use I think for the \ninterpersonal functions it often has in speech (and has less often in writing). \n   While blogs are not necessarily like conversation, one set of keywords \nclearly is drawn from the conversational register:  the use of particles such as  ok (log \nlikelihood 32.43), hey (22.40), oh (17.91), and in particular blogs wow and uhh.  \nSometimes the particles occur in reported speech, and they can in fact serve as \nmarkers of reported speech when there is no reporting verb, as in this example in \nwhich a mother recalls interacting with her toddler daughter during the day: \nI get some details out of her (\u201cHey, have you ever heard of Johan Sebastian \nBach?\u201d . . . ) (Bitch PhD) \nThe toddler daughter signals the shift to her voice with the kind of particle used in \nconversation to get attention.  Or the reported speech may be attributed as a generic \nact to a whole class of people: \n\"ooh, fuzzy\" is not racism. (Bitch PhD) \nA commenter invokes the whole idea of white people responding to black people's \nhair with an elongated oh that suggests the kind of na\u00efve, fascinated, and potentially \noffensive response that has already been discussed in the comments on that post.  \n16 \n \nThese uses are stance-markers in that they shift the voice from that of the writer as \nprincipal to that of a particular or generic person in a conversational setting. \nMost often conversational particles are used to mark a response to another \ncomment.  They come first in the sentence (and in the comment, usually), in the same \nposition as most cognitive verbs and most adverbs, signaling that there is a stance \ncoming even before we know what it is a stance on. \nLD - uhm; we know. (Going Underground) \nUm\u2026.did anyone notice that chap had NOT ONE WORD TO SAY about the \ntopic of this thread, the bogus 44,000 statistic? (Malkin; it is all in bold font in \noriginal) \nThe uhm in the Going Underground example suggests an oral response to LD that \nstarts with the kind of pause one makes before disagreement, in this case, implying \nelliptically that regular readers of the blog are well aware of problems with the \nLondon Underground.  The Malkin example is different, because the commenter is \ntalking to all other readers about a previous comment, but the um also suggests a \nhesitation, and thus potential disagreement with a previous turn or comment.  A \nparticle can also suggest surprise:  \nYes, we were improving after the recession and about to hit another recession, \nbut it still wasn\u2019t great.  Huh? We weren\u201ft improving \u201cafter the recession.\u201d \n(Yglesias) \nThe layers of racism in that sign are amazing. No athletic gear with the \nexception of University of North Dakota Fighting SIOUX apparel. wow. \nwhere to start? (Bitch PhD) \n17 \n \nThe enactment of puzzlement or surprise dramatises the kind of response the writer \nwould make if they were responding in speech, in real time.  A conversational particle \ncan also be used to interrupt and respond to one's own (ironic) train of thought: \neverybody knows Hamas is a bunch of terrorist suicide bombers while the \nTamil Tigers are freedo\u2026uh\u2026they invented the suicide vest? uh\u2026never \nmind. (Yglesias) \nThe commenter here is having a fictional dialogue with himself, as he repeats what he \nsays is a common point of view, that Tamil Tigers are freedom fighters, and then \nresponds to what he presents as an interruption from someone adding this new piece \nof information (the underlined text is a link to a Wikipedia page), and then cancels \nwhat he was saying.  These examples show that conversational particles are not just \nthrown in to approximate the sound of a conversational register, they are carefully \npositioned for rhetorical purposes.   \nConclusion 3:  Conversational particles can be used to enact disagreement (even \ndisagreement with oneself) by showing hesitation, surprise, or self-interruption \nas if played out in real-time interaction. \nIrony \nSo far I have worked from the bottom up, starting with keywords derived by \ncomparing blogs to the BNC Written Sampler, and moving to interpretations of their \nfunctions in context, and from there to generalisations about the rhetoric of blogs.  But \nsome ways of marking stance do not necessarily have a lexical or syntactic signal: one \nexample is the use of irony.  An ironic utterance can be a form of stance-taking \nbecause it expresses an opinion that readers are not to take to be that of the writer.  To \nput this in terms of Goffman's participant roles, we take the writer in the role of \nanimator of the views attributed to others, not as the principal expressing their own \n18 \n \nviews (Goffman, 1981).  In some cases, the writer clearly attributes the ironicised \nviews to someone else: \nYeah, Kafka. It\u201fs a shame all those college graduates won\u201ft have plum jobs \npicking lettuce, washing dishes or working in slaughterhouses. (Yglesias) \nThe original post was about unemployment of college graduates, and someone with \nthe pseudonym Kafka had written a comment linking this unemployment to recent \nlegislation offering legal status to undocumented aliens.  The writer here points out \nthat many those aliens worked at jobs that are not normally those sought by college \ngraduates.  He accomplishes this by setting out a stance that he does not in fact hold \u2013 \n'It's a shame' \u2013 and presenting what follows as agreement with Kafka, as if this was \nwhat Kafka was saying. The cue to the irony is perhaps the conflict between this list \nof kinds of employments and the description 'plum jobs'; it is certainly not any one \nword or construction.    \nIn other cases, there isn't even that kind of signal that the stance stated is to be \nattributed to someone else: \nSee if you can spot the commonality in the following statements:  I don't want \nto talk about it anymore; I get SO TIRED of everything being about race.  I \ndon't understand what you're telling me; I've never seen that or experienced it \nso obviously it is your issue alone. IF it's even true.  Just because you're (insert \nrace) and (insert experience) happened to you doesn't mean it's because you're \n(race); I mean, I once (was followed by a security guard) (had my hair \ntouched) (pulled over unfairly) and I'm white so clearly it isn't about race. \n(Bitch PhD) \nAll the statements given in reported speech are ways of denying that a particular \nnarrative or phenomenon is an instance of racism.  In this case we recognize that the \n19 \n \nwriter does not hold these views just because there are so many ways of denying, all \nlined up.  The witty effect arises because we have to do the processing work ourselves \nto construct the writer's position (before he goes on to make it explicit after this \nexample).   \nIronies typically require some knowledge of the ongoing exchange or shared \nassumptions about the world to be recognized as ironies, especially when they come \nin very short comments without any apparent cues: \nGiven the United States\u201f complete failure to investigate possible war crimes, \nthe only hope for justice is an independent, international investigation. \n(Ygelsias) \nHe deserves his Nobel at least as much as his two Grammies. (Yglesias) \nBoth examples make up the commenter's whole comment.  The first statement asserts \nsomething a contributor to or reader of this blog could well believe, and it is \nrecognizable as ironic only because it repeats a sentence from the original post, itself \na quotation from a spokesperson for Human Rights Watch, substituting 'Unites States' \nfor 'Sri Lanka'.  That then suggests an interpretation undermining the US NGO that \nmade the statement originally.  The second statement, a comment on Obama's Nobel \nPrize, relies on shared frameworks of evaluation.  I had originally thought Obama had \nnot won the Grammy award for recordings, so that the cue for the irony was the \ncontrary-to-fact statement.  But apparently he has won the Grammy twice.\n5\n For \nreaders who know that, the cue for the irony must be the incongruous juxtaposition of \na prestigious award for world peace with an award for commercial popular culture \nproducts;  he did not deserve the Grammies, and now he does not deserve the Nobel. \n20 \n \nOther statements are more obviously attributed.  Here, a quotation from an \nearlier comment (in italics), justifying US actions, is followed by a closely parallel \nversion that is supposedly posted by 'Reynhard Heydrich': \nI mean, we\u2019ve done things that could quite definitely be described as war \ncrimes, but I believe that they were, at times, justified because the people we \nwere fighting had, were currently, and would in the future do way worse than \nwe could on even the ugliest day.  \nI mean, we Nazis have done things that could quite definitely be described as \nwar crimes, but I believe that they were, at times, justified because the \nCommunist scum we were fighting had, were currently, and would in the \nfuture do way worse than we could on even the ugliest day\u2026. \u2013 Reynhard \nHeydrich (Metafilter) \nThe effect of the irony is to suggest that the specious justifications made for the US \nare so broad that they could be used by even the most notorious war criminal.\n6\n  It does \nthis not by direct criticism, but by setting up a word-for-word parallelism (and using \nthe rather less subtle cue of the assumed name). \nMost of the examples so far involve ironic quotation of a statement made \nearlier in the discussion.  More subtly, the irony can be performed by making \nstatements in a voice attributed to others, even without quotation.  Here the shift is \ngradual: \nOh, and these same people don't want the evil communists pushing evolution, \nclimate change, sex ed or having the President they didn't elect tell their kids \nto try hard in school, but hey, we should be able to tell women what they do \nwith their reproductive system, teach kids nothing about sex and bring prayer \nback in schools. I love selective hypocrisy ! \n21 \n \nRant over. As you were. (Sepia Mutiny) \nThere is a shift from free indirect speech ('evil communists pushing evolution', \npresumably the words of 'these same people', not the writer) to free direct speech for \nthe contradictory, hypocritical views, with the direct speech signaled by hey.  'I love \nselective hypocrisy' is complex; the evaluation of these views as 'selective hypocrisy' \nis apparently that of the writer, while the introduction 'I love' assumes the voice of an \nimagined person who enjoys such inconsistencies in moral judgments.  Finally the \nwhole thing is marked as an excessive expression of opinion:  'Rant over'. \n These ironies are common in blog comments; I have coded 50 of them in my \nsample, and I probably missed a lot.  Bloggers resort to ironies because they offer \neconomical ways to distance oneself from other views.  The difficulty in processing \nsome of them, figuring out just what is being said, by whom, adds to the wit, \nparticularly when the comments are very short.  These comments are not just for \nshow; they do make paraphrasable contributions to the discussion: college graduates \ndo not usually compete for jobs with undocumented aliens, the justification offered \nfor US actions are specious, and the religious right in politics is hypocritical.   But \nwhat they say is less important than the way they say it.  Conclusion 4:  Irony \ndramatises an opposing position to undermine it, and in doing so reinforces the \nsense that blogs are a field for stance-taking. \nStance-taking in public discussion \n Blogs broaden the terrain of public discussion, potentially allowing anyone \nwith an internet connection to speak to a wider audience, while previously this \naudience could only be reached by the owners and employees of mass media outlets.  \nAnd they introduce two way communication, from commenter back to blogger, and \nfrom blogger linking to blogger, where before the recipient of a mass media message \n22 \n \ncould only write to the editor, or a Member of Congress or other authority (Thelen, \n1996).  What was perhaps not so well understood, in the early years of enthusiasm for \nblogs, is how crowded this terrain could become.  Bloggers have to compete for any \nkind of attention, because there are so many other bloggers.  The stance-taking that I \nhave analysed in the course of this paper can be understood as a rhetorical response to \nthis crowdedness.  Bloggers spend a great deal of rhetorical effort on placing \nthemselves in relation to other bloggers and other possible posts, aligning themselves \nwith some while signalling their own distinctiveness from all. \n Analysis of some of the most salient keywords in the corpus of blogs, as \ncompared to a general corpus of written language, shows some of the processes at \nwork in stance-taking: \n Conclusion 1:  Cognitive verbs are used mainly to signal a relation to another \nperson or persons, rather than to do their literal task of marking epistemic \nuncertainty.  \n Conclusion 2:  Adverbs, especially when used at the beginning of a comment, can \nsignal a contrastive relation to previous comments. \n Conclusion 3:  Conversational particles can be used to enact disagreement (even \ndisagreement with oneself) by showing hesitation, surprise, or self-interruption as \nif played out in real-time interaction. \n Conclusion 4:  Irony dramatises an opposing position to undermine it, and in \ndoing so reinforces the sense that blogs are a field for stance-taking. \n I have argued that the actual arguments made can become secondary to the \nelaboration of how one's own position fits in the terrain. This emphasis on the process \nof stance-taking, rather than the stance itself, is not in necessarily a bad thing. \nBloggers are quick to seek out the so far unmentioned detail or link, to reflect on their \n23 \n \nown positions, and to pick out, discuss, and ironicise an emerging phrase.  We saw it, \nfor instance, in this example: \nSee if you can spot the commonality in the following statements:  I don't want \nto talk about it anymore . . . \nThe irony only works if we recognise each of the statements the commenter quotes as \nthe sort of thing people might say, and the wit comes because they are condemned by \ntheir own (attributed) words.  Most bloggers are constantly aware, maybe too aware, \nof the huge flow of attention that is the blogosphere.   \n The problem is that blogs quickly slip from the shared argument to saying 'I'm \nhere'.  That assertion can itself be a political act, for instance when the blogger is \ncriticising an authoritarian regime, or bringing to public notice the views of a \nmarginalised group or a buried topic, as when the writers of Sepia Mutiny celebrate \nthe South Asian diaspora in the North America.   And the personalisation does bring \ndown to earth, and to everyday lives, some of the issues that in the mass media may \nbecome abstract and formulaic.  \n But the reminder that 'I'm here' does not lead by itself to exploration of \ndifferences, critique of accepted ideas, or broadening the range of voices any one \ncitizen encounters.  It has often been noted that the self-reinforcing links in blogs lead \nreaders into narrower and narrower views in the great public issues; whatever view I \nhave on an issue, left or right, I am more likely to find much more of it when I log on \nthan I am to find serious challenges to it (Adamic & Glance, 2005; Kumar, Novak, \nRaghavan, & Tomkins, 2004).  The emphasis on stance-taking could be similarly \nlimiting, because of its focus on the rhetoric of placing oneself in the field.  Argument \ngives way to a kind of social networking.  The image of the phalanx of microphones \n24 \n \nat the beginning of this paper does represent one aspect of blogs, but the problem is \nnot getting one's message out, it is having anyone out there to hear. \n \nBiographical note \nGreg Myers is Professor of Rhetoric and Communication at Lancaster University, and \nauthor most recently of Matters of Opinion:  Talking about Public Issues (Cambridge \nUniversity Press) and The Discourse of Blogs and Wikis (Continuum).
