However, there are concerns that developing countries lack the \nrelevant infrastructure and skill base(3).  In 2006, 58% of people in developed countries used \nthe internet, compared with 11% in developing countries and 3% in sub-Saharan Africa.  This \ngap has widened since the millennium(4).   \nAmongst medical students, high levels of computer ownership and ICT use are reported in \nEurope and North America(5,6).  In India, ICT is gaining popularity although computer \nownership lags behind more developed countries and is commoner in private institutions(7,8).  \nIn China, ICT is reported to be increasingly used for medical education(9).  However, studies \nfrom medical schools in Sri-Lanka(10), Mongolia(11) and African countries(12,13) reflect \nconcerns about infrastructure and students\u2019 ICT skills in poorer regions of the word.   \nThere is a lack of cross-sectional data about the current state of ICT at medical schools in \ndeveloping countries, particularly in Africa, where the digital divide is most apparent.  This \nreport aims to address this issue.   \nMETHODS \nWe obtained a list of medical schools from the online list maintained by the Institute for \nInternational Medical Education(14).  We sent questionnaires to Deans and Heads of Medical \nEducation in countries where English was the official language or widely spoken. (Details of \nresponses by country are available online).  The project was discussed with a member of the \nlocal National Research Ethics Service committee and was not deemed to require formal \nethical approval.  A letter of explanation was sent with each questionnaire.  \nNon-respondents received an electronic mailing and two further postal mailings at three \nmonthly intervals.  After this, they were contacted by telephone plus a further mailing if \ncontact was made.  The questionnaire covered the size and structure of the medical school, \nICT capacity, formal teaching of ICT and computerised research, use of computers by \nstudents and access to ICT away from medical school.  The questionnaire was piloted with a \nsample of medical schools before the first mailing. \nData are presented by region(16).  Cameroon, the only country included from Middle Africa, is \ngrouped with Western Africa.  Response rates, frequencies and mean (with standard \ndeviation) are presented as appropriate.  Computer\/student ratio was calculated separately \nfor each institution and then averaged. \nRESULTS \n53\/78 medical schools (69.8%) responded.  Responses stratified by region are shown in table \n1.  Four institutions were involved in a pilot study but then failed to respond to the main study.  \nTheir responses to the pilot study are included for questions which were unchanged after \npiloting.  \nAll institutions reported having computing facilities available to students.  The mean \ncomputer\/student ratio was 0.123 but with regional variations (table 1).  Means of \nrespondents\u2019 estimates of the proportion of their computers with particular hardware \ncapabilities were:- CD-ROM 91.4% (SD 17.9); DVD-ROM 48.1% (SD 35.9); ability to play \nsound 87.3% (SD 22.9); internet 72.5% (SD 30.2).  Overall, internet speeds were rated \u2018fast\u2019 \nor \u2019very fast\u2019 by 19.2%; \u2018average\u2019 by 55.8%; \u2018slow\u2019\/\u2019very slow\u2019 by 25.0%.  No respondents in \nNorthern and Southern Africa reported speeds worse than \u2018average\u2019 but they were rated \n\u2018slow\u2019\/\u2019very slow\u2019 by 58.3% in Eastern Africa and 33.3% in Western\/Middle Africa.  \nComputers were more widely used and integrated into the curriculum in South Africa, with \nhigher computer ownership, higher mean estimates of proportions of students using \ncomputers for producing assignments, research and personal purposes.  Respondents were \ngenerally enthusiastic about the role of computers in the medical curriculum. All respondents \nagreed\/strongly agreed with the statement \u2018I would like to improve my students\u2019 access to IT\u2019.  \n98.1% agreed\/strongly agreed with the statements \u2018I feel that computers allow my students \nbetter access to information\u2019 and \u2018I see funding computing as a priority area\u2019. \n \nDISCUSSION \nICT capacity at medical schools in Africa clearly lags behind more developed regions.  \nComputer ownership by a minority of students is reported and is unsurprisingly more common \nin more prosperous regions.  The use of shared facilities (such as internet cafes) appears \ncommon.   \nParticularly in Eastern, Western and Middle Africa, internet connection speeds are a \nsignificant barrier to downloading medical information, especially bulky files containing video, \naudio, large documents and pictures.  The authors\u2019 experience in Uganda and Tanzania \nreflects this, with typical download times of 3-6 minutes for short Adobe PDF documents from \nEuropean and North American websites.  Given the growth of open access journals and other \nonline initiatives to improve access to health information, slow download times are \nconcerning.  It has been hoped that new intercontinental cables will improve this, but research \nfrom Botswana suggests that delays may persist as the most significant bottlenecks occur \nwithin countries and institutional networks(17).  We urge that internet resources should be \ndesigned to minimise download times with low graphic\/text-only versions, avoiding plug-ins \n(downloadable programs required to access files).  Feedback should be encouraged and \nresources tested from computers in developing countries. \nWhilst CD-ROM appears to be more widely available, low levels of uptake by health workers \nhave been previously reported, possibly related to difficulties distributing sufficient quantities \nand updating materials(13).  Further exploration of CD-ROMs to reach students without \nreliable internet facilities should be considered.  In practice, it may be necessary to provide \nresources on mixed platforms - CD-ROM, internet, DVD - to maximise delivery and overcome \ninfrastructure limitations.   \nMany institutions are providing literature searching and computing skills training.  Given \nconcerns about a lack of ICT skills, this is encouraging.  Furthermore, our data suggest that \nstudents already use ICT for literature searching, preparing assignments and personal tasks \nsuch as e-mail, suggesting both a degree of applied ICT skill and willingness to use \ntechnology.  Educators were positive about using and funding ICT.  The main limitations of \nthis study are our reliance on reports from educators which may be inaccurate, and the speed \nwith which data will become outdated.  Also, our findings may not be reflected in non-English \nspeaking countries.  Internet speeds were subjectively assessed and further work is needed \nto quantify download times and computer specifications. \nThese medical schools were all in major cities.  For health workers in more rural areas, \naccess is likely to be even more limited.  However, our data show that ICT is being used in \nthe undergraduate medical curriculum in Africa, despite limited numbers of mostly older \ncomputers with limited internet access.  Two challenges emerge:  (i) how to improve ICT \ninfrastructure, and (ii) how to respond to growing enthusiasm for ICT using the limited \ninfrastructure currently available.  Interventions should be developed in partnership and \ncarefully evaluated.  We are currently assessing the use of different multimedia platforms to \ndeliver multimedia training, in medical schools, hospitals and rural sites in Africa.  \nTotal = 1092 \nReferences \n \n1.
