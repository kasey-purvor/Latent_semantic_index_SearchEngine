Introduction\n[2] Since the beginnings of magnetospheric science, it has\nbeen recognized that the high-latitude ionosphere can be used\nto image electrodynamic processes occurring in the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetosphere. The earliest theories of the solar wind-\nmagnetosphere interaction were formulated from patterns\nof equivalent ionospheric currents that were interpreted in\nterms of the circulation of magnetospheric plasma driven by\nthe solar wind [Axford and Hines, 1961] and the interplan-\netary magnetic field (IMF) [Dungey, 1961]. Later, Bostro\u00a8m\n[1967] made inferences about the properties of magneto-\nspheric electric fields based on observations of visible aurora\nand ionospheric electric fields. In more recent years, there\nhave been opportunities to deploy instruments on spacecraft\nfor in situmeasurements ofmagnetospheric electric fields and\nplasma convection [e.g., Pedersen et al., 1984; Baumjohann\nand Haerendel, 1985]. However, it has been difficult to\nobserve the coherent large-scale dynamics of magnetospheric\nconvection on the temporal and spatial scales required to\nunderstandmost magnetospheric processes. Thus even to this\nday, our ability to study global magnetospheric electrody-\nnamics is still based largely onmeasurements obtainedwithin\nthe Earth\u2019s ionosphere. Specific examples include routine\nmeasurements of the maximum electrostatic potential differ-\nence across the polar cap (the so-called \u2018\u2018cross-polar poten-\ntial\u2019\u2019) [e.g., Reiff and Luhmann, 1986; Eriksson et al., 2000;\nRuohoniemi et al., 2001; Shepherd et al., 2002] and the\ndetermination of IMF-dependent patterns of ionospheric\nconvection [e.g., Heppner and Maynard, 1987; Weimer,\n1995; Ruohoniemi and Greenwald, 1996].\n[3] The early works of Axford and Hines [1961] and\nDungey [1961] were based on qualitative mappings of\nionospheric convection to the outer magnetosphere.

For example,\nDonovan and Rostoker [1991] projected IMF-dependent\nHeppner-Maynard [Heppner and Maynard, 1987] patterns\nto the equatorial plane using the Tsyganenko T87 and T89\nmagnetic field models [Tsyganenko, 1987, 1989] and com-\npared the results with in situ measurements from the ISEE 1\nspacecraft. In a similar manner, Doe et al. [1992] combined\nthe equatorial projection of the low-latitude portion of\nHeppner-Maynard patterns with a corotation electric po-\ntential and interpreted the resulting patterns in terms of\nIMF-dependent behavior of the plasmasphere. Likewise,\nMaynard et al. [1995] examined equatorial projections of\nHeppner-Maynard patterns and concluded that an apparent\nmismatch between the local-time features of ionospheric\nconvection and cusp precipitation could be attributed to\ncorotation. More recently, ground- and satellite-based iono-\nspheric data sets have been combined using the assimila-\ntive mapping of ionospheric electrodynamics (AMIE)\ntechnique [Richmond and Kamide, 1988] and projected\nto the equatorial magnetosphere for analysis during sub-\nstorms [Lu et al., 2000] and storms [Boonsiriseth et al.,\n2001].\n[4] A theoretical treatment by Hesse et al. [1997]\ninvestigated the accuracy of using ionospheric measure-\nments to predict electric fields and plasma convection in\nthe magnetosphere. They showed that for time-stationary\nmagnetic fields and no dissipation (i.e., ideal magnetohy-\ndrodynamic (MHD)), the electric field at any location is\ngiven by the gradient of an electrostatic potential that is\nconstant along magnetic field lines. Under these circum-\nstances, it is perfectly appropriate to infer the magneto-\nspheric electric field from ionospheric measurements.\nHowever, if the magnetic field varies with time, then\nthe electric field has an additional inductive component\nthat does not map along magnetic field lines to the\nionosphere, and therefore drives a component of magne-\ntospheric convection that cannot be determined from\nionospheric measurements. Hesse et al. [1997] also in-\nvestigated the effect of a magnetic-field-aligned electric\npotential difference on the mapping of convection be-\ntween the ionosphere and magnetosphere. They deter-\nmined that these so-called \u2018\u2018parallel electric fields\u2019\u2019\nproduce a distortion to the mapped convection that is\ndependent on the gradient in parallel potential difference\nperpendicular to the magnetic field, rather than the\nmagnitude of the parallel potential difference itself. This\nmeans that parallel potential differences of only a few\nkilovolts can be associated with significant distortions in\nthe convection, provided that the foot points of the\nparallel electric fields are sufficiently localized in the\nionosphere. Observations indicate that parallel electric\nfields are actually quite common in the auroral zone\n[e.g., Evans, 1974; Block, 1988; Fung and Hoffman,\n1991; Mozer and Kletzing, 1998].\n[5] Rigorous analysis of the extent to which convection\nin the magnetosphere and ionosphere is coupled requires\na systematic comparison of conjugate electric fields\nthroughout the magnetosphere-ionosphere system under\nvarying geomagnetic conditions. Ideally, the two sets of\nmeasurements should have significant contact time so that\nthe spatial and temporal variability of the two time series\ncan be better evaluated. Such an undertaking has been\ndifficult before now because of the sparseness of simul-\ntaneously available conjugate measurements. However,\nthe recent growth of the Super Dual Auroral Radar\nNetwork (SuperDARN) provides new opportunities for\nthis type of comparison. The SuperDARN radars operate\ncontinuously, providing extensive measurements of drift\nvelocities in regions where ionospheric irregularities pro-\nduce measurable backscatter within the radar field of\nview [Greenwald et al., 1985]. The combined fields of\nview of the SuperDARN radars are now large enough to\nmonitor convection at the ionospheric foot point of a\nmagnetospheric spacecraft during a significant fraction of\na pass over the polar region. The European Space Agency\n(ESA) Cluster mission [Escoubet et al., 2001] includes\ntwo electric field experiments that are suitable for conju-\ngate comparison with SuperDARN. The electric field and\nwaves (EFW) instrument utilizes spherical probes at the\nend of long booms to measure the component of the\nelectric field that lies in the spin plane of the spacecraft\n[Gustafsson et al., 1997]. The electron drift instrument\n(EDI) measures the electric field by tracking the guiding\ncenter drift of an electron beam injected perpendicular to\nthe magnetic field [Paschmann et al., 1997]. We have\nchosen to use EDI measurements in this paper because\nEDI provides a three-component measurement of the\nplasma drift, making it ideal for conjugate comparison\nwith SuperDARN.\n[6] The first objective of the paper is to present a\nmathematical formalism that allows comparison of simul-\ntaneous conjugate magnetospheric and ionospheric mea-\nsurements of E \u0001 B convection using a model magnetic\nfield. We then present one case study event in which\nSuperDARN measurements are mapped to the magneto-\nsphere using the Tsyganenko T01 magnetic model\n[Tsyganenko, 2002a, 2002b] and compared with EDI\nmeasurements from one of the Cluster spacecraft. The\nparticular event was selected because of the availability of\nsimultaneous conjugate measurements for an extended\nperiod of time during a Northern Hemisphere pass of\nthe Cluster spacecraft. The overall trends in the EDI and\nSuperDARN measurements during the event are largely\nconsistent with each other, but there are significant\ninconsistencies. The second objective of the paper is to\nevaluate the inconsistencies in terms of the following\nsources: (1) the accuracy of the T01 magnetic field\nmodel; (2) the validity of the assumption of electrostatic\nequipotential magnetic field lines; and (3) the presence of\ninductive electric fields in the magnetosphere. Four sub-\nevent intervals labeled A\u2013D are selected for detailed\nstudy because they contain significant EDI-SuperDARN\ninconsistencies. It is also shown how small inaccuracies\nin the ionospheric foot point locations specified by the\nT01 model can sometimes be identified and reduced.\nSince the primary aim of the paper is to introduce a\nmethodology that will be used in future papers, for\nsimplicity, we focus the analysis on EDI measurements\nfrom the Cluster-3 spacecraft only. However, when ap-\npropriate, the extent to which the Cluster-3 measurements\nare consistent with the other Cluster spacecraft is dis-\ncussed in the text. A more detailed analysis of conjugate\nA01209 BAKER ET AL.: CONJUGATE COMPARISON OF PLASMA DRIFT MEASUREMENTS\n2 of 20\nA01209\nconvection using the full multipoint capabilities of the\nCluster mission is deferred to future efforts.\n2. Electrostatic Mapping of Plasma Convection\nAlong Equipotential Magnetic Fields\n[7] In this section, we present a general mathematical\nformalism that will be used to compare electrostatic fields\nand plasma drifts between two locally small regions that are\nconnected by magnetic field lines assumed to be electric\nequipotentials. This formalism is then extended to a com-\nparison of drift velocity measurements obtained from a\nmagnetospheric spacecraft with conjugate measurements\nat the magnetic foot point in the ionosphere. Unless other-\nwise stated, we assume GSM coordinates throughout this\nsection and the rest of the paper.\n2.1. Mathematical Formalism\n[8] We consider two points, P0 and P\n0\n0, connected by a\nmagnetic field line, L0. We assume mutual orthogonality\nbetween the directions of the electric field, the magnetic\nfield, and the plasma drift velocity at both points. In this\ncase, the electric fields at P0 and P\n0\n0 are\nE0 \u00bc \u0004V0 \u0001 B0; \u00f01a\u00de\nE00 \u00bc \u0004V00 \u0001 B00; \u00f01b\u00de\nwhere B0 and B\n0\n0 are the respective magnetic fields at the\nendpoints P0 and P\n0\n0, while V0 and V\n0\n0 are the corresponding\nplasma drift velocities. We seek an expression that relates\nV0 and V\n0\n0. To that end, we consider two additional points:\nP1 \u00bc P0 \u00fe dr1; \u00f02a\u00de\nP01 \u00bc P00 \u00fe dr01; \u00f02b\u00de\nwhere dr1 and dr\n0\n1 are two small vectors, such that P1 and\nP01 are connected by a second magnetic field line L1. We\nmake the following assumptions: (1) the situation is\nelectrostatic; (2) the magnetic field lines L0 and L1 are\nelectric equipotentials; and (3) the vectors dr1 and dr\n0\n1 are\nboth sufficiently small that the electric field does not change\nalong their lengths (i.e., E1 = E0 and E\n0\n1 = E\n0\n0). In this case,\nthe difference in electrostatic potential at the endpoints of L0\nand L1 are given by the following equivalent relations:\n\u0001\u0002 \u00bc E0 \b dr1; \u00f03a\u00de\n\u0001\u00020 \u00bc E00 \b dr01: \u00f03b\u00de\n[9] These expressions can be equated and rearranged\nusing equation (1) to obtain\ndr01 \u0001 B00\n\u0001 \u0002 \b V00 \u00bc dr1 \u0001 B0\u00f0 \u00de \b V0: \u00f04\u00de\nEquation (4) provides a single constraint on the relationship\nbetween the drift velocities at the endpoints of the magnetic\nfield lines in terms of the magnetic field vectors and the\nspacing between the magnetic field lines. In order to obtain\na fully constrained relationship it is necessary to consider\none additional magnetic field line, L2, whose starting point\nis separated from the point P0 by the small vector dr2 and\nwhose endpoint is separated from P00 by dr\n0\n2. Adopting the\nsame assumptions for the additional magnetic field line we\ncan specify the following system of three equations:\ndr01 \u0001 B00\n\u0001 \u0002 \b V00 \u00bc dr1 \u0001 B0\u00f0 \u00de \b V0; \u00f05a\u00de\ndr02 \u0001 B00\n\u0001 \u0002 \b V00 \u00bc dr2 \u0001 B0\u00f0 \u00de \b V0; \u00f05b\u00de\n0 \u00bc B0 \b V0; \u00f05c\u00de\nwhere equation (5c) simply imposes our initial assumption\nthat the drift velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field\ndirection. The relationship between V0 and V\n0\n0 is now fully\nconstrained in terms of the magnetic field vectors and the\nthree-dimensional spacing between the magnetic field lines\nin the vicinities of P0 and P\n0\n0. If a suitable method exists for\nmapping magnetic field lines between two regions, then\nequations (5a)\u2013(5c) can be solved simultaneously for an\nunknown drift velocity in one location, if the drift velocity\nis specified at the other location.\n2.2. Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Mapping\n[10] As an example, we consider the specific case of a\nsingle spacecraft at point P0 in the magnetosphere taking\nmeasurements of the plasma drift velocity, V0. We specify\nthe starting points of a bundle of three magnetic field lines\nin the vicinity of the spacecraft, one of which, L0, intersects\nthe spacecraft location at P0 and intersects the ionosphere at\nP00. We use a magnetic field model to identify P\n0\n0 and the\nionospheric foot point locations of the other two magnetic\nfield lines L1 and L2. If the ionospheric convection velocity,\nV00, is available from ionospheric measurements, then equa-\ntions (5a)\u2013(5c) can be solved simultaneously for the mag-\nnetospheric velocity, V0. However, ionospheric\nmeasurements are most commonly obtained with respect\nto the rotating Earth, whereas spacecraft measurements are\nusually expressed in Sun-fixed coordinates. The ionospheric\nmeasurements therefore need to be converted to Sun-fixed\ncoordinates by adding a corotation velocity given by\nVrot \u00bc w RE \u00fe h\u00f0 \u00de cos\u0003j^; \u00f06\u00de\nwhere w is the angular frequency of the Earth\u2019s rotation, RE\nis the radius of the Earth, h is the altitude at P00, \u0003 is the\ngeographic latitude, and j^ is the unit vector in the eastward\ndirection. In the electrostatic case, the ionospheric electric\nfield can be expressed in terms of an electrostatic potential,\n\u00020, and equations (5a)\u2013(5c) can be rewritten in the form:\n\u000201 \u0004 \u000200 \u00bc \u0004 dr1 \u0001 B0\u00f0 \u00de \b V0; \u00f07a\u00de\n\u000202 \u0004 \u000200 \u00bc \u0004 dr2 \u0001 B0\u00f0 \u00de \b V0; \u00f07b\u00de\n0 \u00bc B0 \b V0; \u00f07c\u00de\nwhere \u00020i is the electrostatic potential in Sun-fixed\ncoordinates at the ionospheric foot point of field line Li.\nIn practice, we have the freedom to choose the vectors dr1\nA01209 BAKER ET AL.: CONJUGATE COMPARISON OF PLASMA DRIFT MEASUREMENTS\n3 of 20\nA01209\nand dr2 arbitrarily, so long as they are not along the\ndirection of the primary magnetic field line, L0. A simple\nchoice is to specify that dr1 and dr2 are of equal length, \u0001l,\nand aligned, respectively, along the directions of the GSM x\nand y axes (provided that B0 does not lie in the x-y plane). In\nthis case, equations (7a)\u2013(7c) can be expressed as\n\u000201 \u0004 \u000200 \u00bc \u0001l B0zV0y \u0004 B0yV0z\n\u0001 \u0002\n; \u00f08a\u00de\n\u000202 \u0004 \u000200 \u00bc \u0001l \u0004B0zV0x \u0004 B0xV0z\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f08b\u00de\n0 \u00bc B0xV0x \u00fe B0yV0y \u00fe B0zV0z; \u00f08c\u00de\nwhere V0 = (V0x, V0y, V0z) and B0 = (B0x, B0y, B0z). In this\nform, equations (8a)\u2013(8c) relate the distribution of electro-\nstatic potential in the vicinity of the ionospheric foot point\nof a magnetospheric spacecraft (left-hand sides) to the\nmagnetic field and drift velocity at the spacecraft location\n(right-hand sides). Using ionospheric measurements and a\nmagnetic field model it is possible to solve equations (8a)\u2013\n(8c) simultaneously for an estimate of the magnetospheric\nplasma drift velocity, V0, which can then be compared with\nthe spacecraft measurements. If magnetic measurements are\navailable at the spacecraft then they can be used in\nequations (8a)\u2013(8c) instead of the model magnetic values,\nin which case, the role of the magnetic model is confined to\ndefining the magnetic conjugacy between the spacecraft and\nthe ionosphere.\n[11] These equations provide a useful framework with\nwhich to evaluate the consistency between ionospheric and\nmagnetospheric measurements in terms of our understand-\ning of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. A number of\nfactors might contribute to apparent inconsistencies between\nthe ionospheric and magnetospheric measurements. Exam-\nples of geophysical influences that might violate the initial\nassumptions used to derive the equations include (1) spatial\ngradients in the magnetic field across the field line bundle,\n(2) spatial gradients in the perpendicular electric field across\nthe bundle, (3) the presence of inductive electric fields, and\n(4) perpendicular gradients in parallel electric field across\nthe bundle. It should be emphasized that in the last case, the\npresence of a parallel electric field, in and of itself, is not\nsufficient to explain any inconsistencies if the parallel\nelectric field is constant across the whole ionosphere.\nRather, it is a \u2018\u2018perpendicular gradient\u2019\u2019 in parallel electric\nfield that produces partial decoupled convection between\nthe magnetosphere and the ionosphere [Hesse et al., 1997].\nOther inconsistencies might be associated with the accuracy\nof the magnetic field model and the specification of mag-\nnetic foot points in the ionosphere. In section 4.2 we\ndemonstrate how one can identify suitable error estimates\nfor the location of the T01 foot points. Section 4.5 intro-\nduces a method that seeks to minimize the error in the foot\npoint locations.\n[12] In most cases, rigorous identification of a particular\ninconsistency with a single source or collection of sources\ncan be difficult. For example, localized parallel electric\nfields may, in some cases, be associated with the presence\nof field-aligned currents that alter the mapping of magnetic\nfield lines between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere.\nHowever, it is sometimes possible to use contextual infor-\nmation from other measurements to arrive at some qualita-\ntive conclusions as to which sources of inconsistency might\nbe dominant in some situations. This will be demonstrated\nfor the case study analysis in section 4.\n3. Data Sets and Models\n[13] In this section, the Tsyganenko T01 magnetic field\nmodel is introduced, and the characteristics of the Cluster\nEDI and SuperDARN instrumentation are described.\n3.1. Tsyganenko T01 Magnetic Field Model\n[14] The Tsyganenko magnetic field models specify\nexternal contributions to the magnetospheric magnetic field\nthrough a combination of mathematical formalism and\nempirical modeling [e.g., Tsyganenko, 1987, 1989, 1995,\n2002a, 2002b]. The most recent of these (hereafter \u2018\u2018T01\u2019\u2019)\n[Tsyganenko, 2002a, 2002b] is represented as the sum of\nmagnetic effects from up to five current systems: (1) the\nChapman-Ferraro currents on the magnetopause; (2) the\nring current; (3) the cross-tail current; (4) the large-scale\nfield-aligned currents (regions 1 and 2); and (5) shielding\ncurrents to ensure that the magnetic effects are wholly\ncontained within the magnetopause. There is also an addi-\ntional contribution associated with partial penetration of the\nIMF into the dayside magnetosphere. The magnetopause\nsize and shape are specified by the solar wind dynamic\npressure and dipole tilt angle [Shue et al., 1998]. The T01\nmodel incorporates several improvements over its prede-\ncessors. It is better constrained by in situ observations, has a\nmore sophisticated mathematical specification of the cur-\nrents, an improved fitting procedure, and more realistic\nparameterization on solar wind and IMF. The total field\nincludes 24 coefficients and 18 nonlinear parameters deter-\nmined by optimal fitting of magnetometer data from seven\nspacecraft missions spanning 1984\u20131999. The input param-\neters to the T01 model are solar wind dynamic pressure,\nIMF By and Bz components in GSM coordinates, Dst index,\nand two averaged interplanetary parameters G1 and G2\ngiven by the following equations,\nG1 \u00bc hhVx sin3 qc=2\u00f0 \u00dei; \u00f09a\u00de\nG2 \u00bc ahVzBsi; \u00f09b\u00de\nh \u00bc B?=Bc\u00f0 \u00de\n2\n1\u00fe B?=Bc\u00f0 \u00de ; \u00f09c\u00de\nB? \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nB2y \u00fe B2z\nq\n; \u00f09d\u00de\nwhere Vx is the x component of the solar wind velocity, qc is\nthe IMF clock angle, Bc = 40 nT, a = 0.005, and Bs = jBzj for\nBs \r 0 or 0 otherwise. The averaging is done over the\nprevious hour. Parameter G1 controls the strength of the\nnear-Earth lobe field, while G2 controls the distance to\nthe tail current, as well as the amplitude and scale size of the\nregion 1 and region 2 field-aligned currents. Formally, G1\nA01209 BAKER ET AL.: CONJUGATE COMPARISON OF PLASMA DRIFT MEASUREMENTS\n4 of 20\nA01209\nand G2 have the dimensionality of velocity and electric\nfield, respectively. However, their normalizations were\nchosen somewhat arbitrarily to impose a dynamic range\nthat has no stand-alone physical meaning. Furthermore, G1\nincludes a nonlinear dependence on B? and qc, while G2\ncould, in principle, be defined dimensionless. For these\nreasons, it is in some sense inappropriate to assign specific\nunits to either parameter, and we will instead treat them both\nas ad hoc dimensionless indices. It should also be noted that\ncorrection of the Dst index for the effect of the solar wind\ndynamic pressure is done internal to the T01 model.\n3.2. Electron Drift Instrument\n[15] The ESA Cluster mission became operational in\nFebruary 2001 and comprises four identical spacecraft in\nhigh-inclination elliptical orbits with apogee \u000e20 RE and\nperigee \u000e4 RE. The four spacecraft fly in formation with an\ninterspacecraft separation that typically varies from 100 to\n18,000 km [Escoubet et al., 2001]. During March 2001, the\nseparation distances were approximately 800 km. The\nCluster EDI measures the drift velocity of magnetospheric\nplasma by tracking a 0.5- or 1.0-keV electron beam injected\nperpendicular to the local magnetic field [Paschmann et al.,\n2001]. The EDI technique makes use of the fact that a\ndrifting electron beam returns to the spacecraft only when\nfired in unique directions. Once these directions have been\nidentified, the drift velocity can be deduced from the\nelectron guiding center drift velocity by either \u2018\u2018triangula-\ntion\u2019\u2019 [Quinn et al., 2001] or \u2018\u2018time-of-flight\u2019\u2019 analysis\n[Paschmann et al., 2001]. EDI consists of two gun-detector\nunits (GDUs) and a controller unit. The GDUs are mounted\non opposite sides of the spacecraft with oppositely directed\nfields of view. The electron guns can fire in any direction\nwithin a hemisphere, thereby allowing measurement of any\narbitrary electric field configuration. As many as several\nhundred return beams can be received per spacecraft spin,\ndepending on conditions.\n[16] The EDI technique provides a full measurement of\nE?, the electric field perpendicular to the magnetic field.\nThis represents an advantage over traditional double-probe\ninstruments that measure the component of E? in the plane\ndefined by the wire booms of the probe. Furthermore,\ndouble-probe measurements may, in some cases, become\ncontaminated by electric fields induced by spacecraft\nwakes, sheaths, and photoelectrons. EDI is less susceptible\nto these contaminations because it senses the electric field at\na location removed from the spacecraft by a distance of one\nelectron gyroradius (typically 3\u20135 km). However, there are\na number of situations in which EDI can be expected to\nsuffer a temporary loss of data. These include (1) loss of\nbeam tracking due to rapid changes in the electric field or\nmagnetic field direction and (2) signal-to-noise problems as\na result of insufficient return beam strength and\/or excessive\nfluxes of ambient electrons. All EDI data presented in this\npaper are one-spin (4-s) averages that have been corrected\nfor the motion of the spacecraft. Quality flags have been\nassigned to the data (GOOD, CAUTION, or BAD) based on\nthe distribution of all return beams measured within the one-\nspin integration time. Only GOOD and CAUTION data\nhave been retained for use in this paper.\n3.3. Super Dual Auroral Radar Network\n(SuperDARN)\n[17] SuperDARN is an international collaborative net-\nwork of high-latitude HF radars that measure coherent\nbackscatter from decameter-scale ionospheric irregularities\nthat are aligned parallel to the magnetic field direction. The\nDoppler shift of the backscatter is proportional to the line-\nof-sight component of the E \u0001 B plasma drift in the\nscattering region [Villain et al., 1985; Ruohoniemi et al.,\n1987]. At the present time there are nine SuperDARN\nradars in the Northern Hemisphere and six in the Southern\nHemisphere. Figure 1 shows the combined fields of view of\nthe Northern Hemisphere radars. A detailed description of\nSuperDARN as it existed at the start of the International\nSolar Terrestrial Physics (ISTP) mission is given in the work\nof Greenwald et al. [1995]. In brief, SuperDARN radars\nutilize an array of electronically phased antennas that can be\nsteered in 16 beam directions across an azimuth sector of\n50\u0004. A variety of multipulse sounding sequences are used to\nunambiguously determine the range and Doppler velocity of\nthe irregularities, while a secondary antenna array provides\nvertical angle-of-arrival information that can be used to\ndetermine their altitude. All SuperDARN radars operate\ncontinuously (except for very infrequent data outages) and\ntypically operate at a temporal resolution of 1\u20132 min. All\nresults presented in this paper are at 2-min resolution.\n[18] Ruohoniemi and Baker [1998] developed an analysis\nprocedure that combines all available SuperDARN Doppler\ndata within a hemisphere and determines a solution for the\nionospheric electrostatic potential as a weighted least\nsquares fit to a spherical harmonic expansion of associated\nLegendre functions. The ability of the radars to measure\nvelocities at a given location is dependent on the presence of\nmagnetic-field-aligned irregularities to backscatter the radar\nsignal. Other reasons why the radars might not measure\nFigure 1. Combined field of view for the nine Northern\nHemisphere SuperDARN radars.

In regions\nwhere backscatter is not available, the drift velocity can\nbe estimated from the statistical convection models of\nRuohoniemi and Greenwald [1996].\n4. Event Analysis: 0700\u20131200 UT\non 12 March 2001\n[19] We now use the formalism described in section 2.2\nto compare SuperDARN and Cluster EDI drift measure-\nments during 0700\u20131200 UT on 12 March 2001. For\nsimplicity, we confine our attention to Cluster EDI data\nobtained from the Cluster-3 spacecraft. The particular\nevent period was chosen because it provided simultaneous\nconjugate SuperDARN and EDI measurements for an\nextended period of time. We focus our attention on the\nfollowing four subevent intervals when there were signif-\nicant EDI-SuperDARN inconsistencies: A, 0730\u20130745; B,\n0930\u20131000; C, 1005\u20131020; and D, 1100\u20131145 UT. An\neffort will be made to reconcile the inconsistencies in\nterms of possible sources.\n[20] The trajectory of the Cluster-3 spacecraft during the\nevent interval is shown in Figure 2. Figures 2a\u20132c show\nplanar projections of the Cluster-3 orbit onto the GSM\naxes. Figure 2d shows the track of ionospheric foot points\nobtained by mapping from the Cluster-3 location to the\nnorthern ionosphere using the T01 model. The foot points\nare plotted in magnetic latitude (MLAT) (\u0003) versus\nmagnetic local time (MLT) format using the altitude\nadjusted corrected geomagnetic coordinates (AACGM)\nsystem of Baker and Wing [1989]. The minimum latitude\nshown is 60\u0004, and magnetic noon is directed toward the\ntop. During the event interval, the Cluster-3 spacecraft\nwas crossing the northern polar cap at high altitude in an\norbit that was approximately aligned along the midnight-\nnoon meridian.\n4.1. T01 Model Input Parameters\n[21] Interplanetary inputs to the T01 model were obtained\nfrom the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft\nlocated in the solar wind \u000e227 RE upstream of the Earth.\nIMF measurements were obtained from the ACE magne-\nFigure 2.

(d) The ground track of T01 magnetic foot points in the Northern Hemisphere ionosphere at an\naltitude of 400 km.

Figure 3 displays time series plots\nfor the six T01 input parameters during the event interval.\nThe time spans of the subevent intervals A\u2013D are identified\nat the top of the plot for later reference. All input parameters\nhave been interpolated to a common resolution of 1 min.\nFrom top to bottom the parameters are SYM-H index, solar\nwind dynamic pressure, IMF By and Bz (GSM coordinates),\nand G1 and G2 parameters. The SYM-H index is a 1-min\naverage of the H component magnetic disturbance measured\nby midlatitude magnetometers and can be considered a\nhigh-resolution version of the hourly Dst index [Iyemori\nand Rao, 1996]. The interplanetary parameters have been\nshifted by a 67-min transit time to account for propagation\nof the solar wind from the ACE location at (227, \u000438, and\n\u00049) RE in the solar wind to the Cluster-3 location within the\nmagnetosphere. The transit time was calculated by matching\nthe foot of a reduction in the Bx component of the geomag-\nnetic field measured by the Cluster-3 fluxgate magnetometer\n(FGM) instrument [Balogh et al., 1997] at 1010\u20131014 UT\nwith the foot of a reduction in solar wind pressure measured\nat 0907 UT by ACE (see Figure 4). This transit time is\nslightly larger than the 65-min transit time obtained by using\na magnetopause standoff distance of 10 RE and assuming\nballistic propagation of the solar wind at the measured x\ncomponent velocity of Vx \u000e360 km\/s. During the event\ninterval, the IMF By component was steady and positive,\nwhile the Bz component made a transition from steady\nFigure 3.

Cluster FGM Measurements\n[22] The accuracy of the technique developed in section\n2.2 is dependent on the ability of the magnetic field model\nto correctly specify the magnetic conjugacy. An obvious\nquality check on the accuracy of the model during the\nevent is to examine how closely it reproduces the magnetic\nfield measured at the Cluster-3 location by the FGM\ninstrument. This is done in Figure 4. Figures 4a\u20134c\nshow the GSM Bx, By, and Bz components of the magnetic\nfield measured by FGM (solid) and the corresponding\nT01 model estimates (dashed); Figures 4d\u20134f show the\ndifferences between the measured and modeled values\n(GSM dBx, dBy, and dBz); and Figure 4g shows the\ntime-shifted solar wind dynamic pressure. The time\nspans of the subevent intervals A\u2013D are again provided\nacross the top of the figure. There is a good agreement\nbetween the T01 model and FGM measurements\nthroughout much of the event interval, but there are\nalso notable discrepancies. In particular, the bipolar\nperturbations in the By component measured by FGM\nbetween 0710 and 0730 UT are consistent with the\nspacecraft passing through the region 1 and region 2\nfield-aligned current sheets under moderate levels of\ngeomagnetic activity [e.g., Donovan, 1993]. As noted\nin section 4.1, there was a sudden reduction in solar\nwind dynamic pressure measured by ACE at 0907 UT.\nFigure 4 shows that there was a drop in GSM Bx\nFigure 4.

The modeled T01 Bx compo-\nnent, though also small, made a transition from positive to\nnegative values at approximately 1000 UT. One plausible\ninterpretation of this discrepancy is that the T01 model\nincorrectly estimates a crossing of the high-altitude bound-\nary between the open field lines of the tail lobe and the\nclosed field lines of the dayside magnetosphere. The con-\nsistent sunward direction of the magnetic field measured by\nFGM suggests that Cluster-3 was instead attached to the\nopen tail lobe throughout the event interval. This discrep-\nancy can perhaps be explained by the limitations of the T01\nmodel parameterization. As explained in section 3.1, the\nlocation of the T01 magnetopause is dependent only on the\ninstantaneous value of the solar wind dynamic pressure and\ndipole tilt angle. Motion of the dayside magnetopause\nassociated with magnetic reconnection during extended\nperiods of southward IMF is not included in the model.\nFigure 3 shows that the IMF had been southward for over\n45 min at 1000 UT and continued to stay southward for the\nremainder of the event interval. It is thus likely that the\ndayside magnetic flux was significantly eroded by magnetic\nreconnection during this time. Under these circumstances,\none might expect the T01 model to overestimate the amount\nof closed magnetic flux in the dayside magnetosphere. This\nis consistent with the fact that the T01 model incorrectly\nidentified a transition from tailward to sunward directed\nmagnetic field lines along the Cluster-3 trajectory.\n[24] The accuracy of the T01 estimate for the Cluster-3\nmagnetic field can be improved by tweaking the input\nparameters to produce better agreement with FGM measure-\nments. One might hope that the tweaked input parameters\nwill produce a more accurate mapping to the ionosphere.\nHowever, this is not necessarily the case because there may\nbe a large number of T01 input parameter combinations that\nreproduce the FGM measurements more accurately but\nnevertheless produce very different mappings to the iono-\nsphere. Choosing which particular set of tweaked input\nparameters to use would then be somewhat arbitrary.\nNevertheless, this type of tweaking analysis provides a\nvaluable check on the sensitivity of the T01 model to its\ninput parameters and can provide qualitative error estimates\non the location of the foot points. Table 1 shows the upper\nand lower limits (or dynamic ranges) of the six input\nparameters for which the T01 model is valid. The first step\nin the tweaking analysis is to normalize the T01 input\nparameters to their respective dynamic ranges so that each\ninput is expressed on a scale between 0 and 1. New sets of\ninput parameters are considered by defining a tweaking\nfactor, T, to be the root-mean square deviation of the new\ninputs from the nominal T01 inputs expressed in the\nnormalized six-dimensional parameter space. All possible\nsets of input parameters corresponding to a particular value\nof T were considered. Any sets of tweaked inputs that\ncontained one or more input values that fell outside the\ndynamic ranges specified in Table 1 were immediately\ndiscarded as being beyond the working limitations of the\nT01 model. All other input combinations were tested to see\nif they produced better agreement with the FGM measure-\nments. The input parameters were then ranked according to\nthe mean square deviation of the T01 outputs from the FGM\nmeasurements. Field line mappings to the ionosphere were\nproduced for the leading 1000 sets of tweaked input\nparameters, and the spatial offset from the location of the\nnominal T01 foot point to the tweaked foot point was\ncalculated. This process was repeated for each 2-min\ninterval during the entire event using different values for\nthe tweaking factor, T.\n[25] Figure 5 shows the results of this tweaking anal-\nysis. The difference between FGM measurements and\nT01 model estimates is shown for the leading 1000 sets\nof tweaked input parameters. Figures 5a\u20135d show the\ndBx, dBy, dBz, and dB offsets in the magnetic field (GSM\ncoordinates) at Cluster-3, while Figure 5e shows the\nspatial offset from the nominal T01 foot point location\nin the ionosphere. Each point has been colored according\nto the minimum tweaking factor, T, as measured by the\ncolor scale at the right. Also plotted in red are the results\nobtained by using the nominal T01 input parameters,\nwhile those plotted in black are the optimal results. The\nanalysis was not carried out for the interval immediately\nprior to 0730 UT when the Cluster-3 FGM instrument\nmeasured the effects of the region 1 and region 2 field-\naligned currents. For most of the rest of the event period,\nit can be seen that tweaking the T01 inputs produces\nimproved T01 output values that agree with the FGM\nmeasurements to within 1\u20132 nT. Furthermore, in many\ncases, this improved agreement is obtained with relatively\nsmall values for the tweaking factor and spatial offset.\nHowever, it is interesting to note that during the last hour\nof the event interval no amount of tweaking can com-\npletely correct the offset in the By component. Figure 5e\nshows that the magnitude of the spatial offset in the\nionosphere increases as the Cluster-3 spacecraft moves\ntoward the dayside magnetopause, and the T01 model\noutput becomes relatively more sensitive to variation of\nits input parameters. Assuming that the geomagnetic field\nis accurately represented by the input parameter space\nspanned by the T01 model, it is therefore reasonable to\nexpect a maximum error of 400 km for the T01 foot\npoint locations during the entire event interval.\n4.3. SuperDARN Ionospheric Convection Patterns\n[26] Figure 6 shows ionospheric convection patterns\nobtained from the Ruohoniemi and Baker [1998] electro-\nstatic potential analysis of SuperDARN data at four differ-\nent times during the event period: 0734, 0946, 1010, and\n1130 UT. These times were chosen to be representative of\nthe ionospheric convection during each of the subevent\nintervals A\u2013D, respectively. Line-of-sight velocity mea-\nTable 1.

The results are presented in\nthe same AACGM Sun-fixed \u0003-MLT format that was used\nin Figure 2d. The minimum latitude is 60\u0004, and magnetic\nnoon is directed toward the top. Negative (positive)\npotential contours are displayed as solid (dashed) lines,\nand the contour spacing is 6 kV. Self-consistent velocity\nvectors are overplotted in locations for which line-of-sight\nvelocity measurements were obtained by one or more\nSuperDARN radars and are colored according to the velo-\ncity scale at the right. For each convection image, the\ninstantaneous location of the T01 ionospheric foot point\nfor the magnetic field line threading the Cluster-3 space-\ncraft is identified as a small triangle. In addition, the\nlocations of Fort Smith, Canada (60.03\u0004N, 248.07\u0004W),\nand Ny Alesund (NAL), Norway (78.92\u0004N, 11.95\u0004E) are\nidentified by asterisks on the images at 0734 and 1010 UT,\nrespectively. It can be seen that Cluster-3 was closely\nconjugate to these locations at these times. In section 4.4,\nground-based measurements obtained from these locations\nwill provide contextual information for the comparison of\n      \n \n      \n \n      \n \n      \n \nFigure 5.

Electrostatic Conjugate Comparison of EDI\nand SuperDARN Measurements\n[27] In this section, measurements of E \u0001 B drift obtained\nfrom SuperDARN and Cluster EDI will be compared with\neach other during the 12 March 2001 event. Following the\nformalism developed in section 2.2, the magnetic field lines,\nLi, are chosen such that L0 initiates at the instantaneous\nlocation of Cluster-3, while the starting points of L1 and L2\nare each displaced a distance \u0001l from Cluster-3 along the\nGSM x and y directions, respectively. A value of\u0001l = 0.1 RE\nwas chosen so that the separation of the Li foot points in the\nionosphere was less than the spatial resolution of the grid\nused in the Ruohoniemi and Baker [1998] analysis of\nSuperDARN data (\u000e110 km). This choice was in keeping\nwith the assumption that the electric and magnetic fields are\nconstant across the bundle of magnetic field lines. The\nvalues of electrostatic potential, \u00020i, are assigned to the\nmagnetic field lines from the Ruohoniemi and Baker\n[1998] analysis, based on the locations of the T01 iono-\nspheric foot points at an altitude of 400 km. It should be\nstressed that \u00020i have been corrected for corotation and are\nexpressed in the same Sun-fixed GSM coordinates that are\nused for the Cluster-3 measurements. Finally, the value for\nthe magnetic field, B0, at the Cluster-3 location is provided\nby the Cluster FGM measurements. With these quantities\nspecified, equations (8a)\u2013(8c) are used to obtain a Super-\nDARN estimate for the drift velocity at Cluster-3 that can be\ncompared directly with the EDI measurements.\n[28] The results of the SuperDARN-EDI plasma drift\ncomparison for 0700\u20131200 UT on 12 March 2001 are\nshown in Figure 7. Figures 7a\u20137c show the Vx, Vy, and\nVz GSM components of E \u0001 B drift; Figure 7d is the\ndrift velocity magnitude (V); Figure 7e is the distance\nfrom the T01 ionospheric foot point to the nearest Super-\nDARN line-of-sight velocity measurement (dR); and\nFigure 7f is the time-shifted solar wind dynamic pressure.\nIn Figures 7a\u20137d the Cluster EDI measurements sampled\nat the spin period of the spacecraft (4-s) are plotted in\nblue, while the SuperDARN ionospheric measurements\n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nFigure 6.

Solid red\nlines are used for times when SuperDARN line-of-sight\nvelocity measurements were available within 250 km of\nthe Cluster-3 foot point (i.e., dR < 250 km); dashed red\nlines are used otherwise. This cutoff value for dR was\nchosen arbitrarily to represent periods of time when the\nionospheric electric field is well defined by SuperDARN\nmeasurements at the foot point location. This distinction\nis important because the ionospheric electrostatic potential\nobtained from the Ruohoniemi and Baker [1998] analysis\nis a combination of SuperDARN line-of-sight velocity\nmeasurements where available and statistical models\notherwise. The degree of correspondence between Super-\nDARN and EDI at any given time is thus dependent on\nthe extent to which the SuperDARN radars are able to\nmeasure convection velocities in the vicinity of the\nCluster-3 foot point.\n[29] Figure 7 shows good general agreement in the trend\nof EDI and SuperDARN drift velocities throughout much of\nthe event interval. For example, both data sets show an\nincrease in the strength of antisunward convection during\nthe latter part of the event when the IMF became southward.\nHowever, there are also intervals in which there are note-\nworthy differences. The most prominent of these fall within\nthe periods labeled by the letter classifications A\u2013D. The\nremainder of this paper is focused on identifying possible\nsources for these inconsistencies.

First, the relative geometry of the \u2018\u2018true\u2019\u2019 iono-\nspheric foot points in the bundle of magnetic field lines Li\nmight be twisted with respect to the T01 model foot points.\nThe other possibility is that the true foot points might be\ncollectively translated from the T01 foot points by some\nsmall distance. This second, much simpler, possibility is\nconsidered in some detail in the next section.\n4.5. Optimized T01 Ionospheric Foot Points\n[30] In section 4.2, it was demonstrated that the difference\nbetween the FGM magnetic field measurements at Cluster-3\nand the T01 estimates using the nominal range of input\nparameters could be responsible for producing errors in\nionospheric foot point location as large as 400 km. We now\ninvestigate the effect that small offsets of this magnitude\nmight have on the consistency between the EDI and Super-\nDARN drift measurements. We assume that the relative\ngeometry of the Li foot points is conserved and seek the\nmagnitude and direction of a small spatial offset in the\nionosphere, that when applied collectively to the field line\nbundle produces improved correspondence between the EDI\nand SuperDARN observations. A small circular area cen-\ntered on the nominal T01 L0 foot point location is searched\nfor the ionospheric location at which the SuperDARN E\u0001 B\ndrift velocity has the smallest root-mean-square deviation\nfrom the EDI-measured velocity. If an improved foot point\nlocation is identified within the search area, then the drift\nvelocity at the nominal T01 foot point is replaced with\nthe velocity from the new (or \u2018\u2018optimized\u2019\u2019) foot point.\nFigure 8 shows the improved results that can be obtained by\nperforming this simple procedure. Figures 8a\u20138c show\nthe Vx, Vy, and Vz GSM components of plasma drift\nat Cluster-3. Black curves represent EDI measurements\naveraged to the 2-min resolution of the SuperDARN\nmeasurements. Multiple colors are used to represent Super-\nDARN estimates obtained from optimized foot points\nwithin different-sized search areas. Blue, green, and red\ncurves, respectively, represent search areas with radii of\n100, 200, and 400 km, respectively. Figures 8d and 8e\nshow the magnetic latitude and local time of the nominal\nL0 foot point (black) and optimized foot points (colored).\nThe subevent intervals A\u2013D are again shown along the\ntop of the figure for reference.\n[31] The results in Figure 8 demonstrate that searching for\noptimized foot point locations can sometimes produce\nsignificant improvement in the consistency between EDI\n(black) and SuperDARN (colored) observations. However,\nit should be cautioned that the technique provides only a\nqualitative improvement because there is no guarantee that\nthe optimized T01 foot point is the true magnetic foot point\nappropriate to the particular magnetospheric conditions at\nany given time. Indeed, it is likely that in some instances the\nsearch for optimized foot points may produce EDI-Super-\nDARN correspondence that is artificially closer than it\nshould be. Nevertheless, the technique does provide some\nvaluable qualitative information about the performance of\nthe T01 model. During some periods the black and colored\ncurves converge as the search area widens, indicating that\nthe inconsistencies between SuperDARN and EDI can\nprobably be attributed, at least in some part, to errors in\nthe T01 magnetic mapping. This convergence is particularly\nevident during interval D when Cluster-3 was conjugate to\nthe noon-sector \u2018\u2018convection throat\u2019\u2019 region. By contrast,\nduring intervals A and C the technique yields only modest\nimprovements in consistency as the search area widens.\nThis suggests that foot point displacement is not the primary\nexplanation for the inconsistencies during these intervals.\n5. Discussion\n[32] We now discuss the EDI and SuperDARN measure-\nments during each of the subevent intervals A\u2013D in some\ndetail and attempt to reconcile the inconsistencies in terms\nof limitations of the T01 model or the presence of parallel\nand\/or inductive electric fields. Where appropriate, the\nconsistency between Cluster-3 measurements and those\nobtained on the other Cluster spacecraft is discussed. In\nsome cases, observations from ground-based measurements\nprovide additional contextual information about the geo-\nmagnetic conditions on magnetic field lines in the vicinity\nof Cluster-3.\n5.1. Interval A (0730\u20130745 UT)\n[33] During interval A the Cluster-3 spacecraft was con-\njugate to the premidnight auroral zone at \u000e70\u0004 magnetic\nlatitude (see Figure 2). Figure 7 shows large inconsistencies\nin the strength and direction of the plasma flow measured by\nEDI and derived from SuperDARN. EDI observed large\nflows toward the central plasma sheet (\u0004Z) and dusk (+Y),\nwhereas the projected SuperDARN flows were of lesser\nmagnitude and predominantly toward dawn (\u0004Y). This\ndiscrepancy occurred despite the fact that SuperDARN\nline-of-sight velocity measurements were available in the\nclose vicinity of the Cluster-3 ionospheric foot point\nas specified by T01 during this period. Moreover, the\nfoot point optimization technique did not yield significant\nimprovement in the agreement between the EDI and Super-\nDARN data sets (see Figure 8). It is therefore tempting to\nconsider a geophysical source for the inconsistency that\nmight be associated with the field-aligned currents mea-\nsured by FGM just prior to interval A at 0710\u20130730 UT\n(see Figure 4). Donovan [1993] has shown that moderate\nfield-aligned currents (200 nT at 800 km) can shift the\nionospheric foot point of magnetic field lines by up to\n0.3 hours of magnetic local time. However, a collective\ntranslation of foot points of this magnitude is within the\nrange evaluated in the optimized foot points procedure and\nis therefore insufficient to explain the inconsistency. The\nresults therefore suggest that if the inconsistency is associ-\nated with a distorted field-line mapping due to the effects of\nthe field-aligned current, then the bundle of field lines must\nhave been twisted with respect to the T01 model.\n[34] Other possibilities that may have affected the agree-\nment during this period include partial decoupling of\nmagnetospheric and ionospheric convection due to the\npresence of a spatially localized region of parallel electric\nfield and\/or the existence of an inductive electric field. As\nnoted in the introduction, perpendicular gradients in parallel\nelectric fields produce distortions in the mapping of con-\nvection between the magnetosphere and ionosphere [Hesse\net al., 1997]. Figure 9 shows measurements obtained from\nCanadian Auroral Network for the OPEN Program Unified\nStudy (CANOPUS) instruments at Fort Smith, Canada\nA01209 BAKER ET AL.: CONJUGATE COMPARISON OF PLASMA DRIFT MEASUREMENTS\n13 of 20\nA01209\n(60.03\u0004N, 248.07\u0004W). The asterisk in Figure 6a identifies\nthe MLAT-MLT location of Fort Smith, which was closely\nconjugate with Cluster-3 at 0734 UT. The parameters\ndisplayed in Figure 9 from top to bottom are meridian\nscanning photometer (MSP) brightness keogram at 557 nm,\nx component (geographic northward) magnetic disturbance,\nand riometer voltage (Note: decreased riometer voltage is\nindicative of increased ionospheric absorption, and hence\n>30 keV electron precipitation). Despite the fact that it was\ncloudy at Fort Smith, the CANOPUS measurements con-\nfirm that there was significant auroral activity during\ninterval A in the vicinity of the Cluster-3 foot point location.\nVertical lines indicate two prominent auroral onsets at 0726\nand 0741 UT that were measured by all three CANOPUS\ninstruments. Figure 10 is a stackplot of the x component\nfrom six magnetometers in the east-west CANOPUS chain\nfrom Dawson (west) to Gillam (east). It provides a wider\nspatial context for the Fort Smith observations, and in\nparticular, shows that the two auroral onsets identified by\nthe vertical lines are merely two of a series of three to four\nregularly spaced (10\u201315 min) pseudo-onsets that precede\nthe onset of a major substorm expansive phase, which\nFigure 8.

These ground-based\nobservations are therefore consistent with the presence of\ninductive and\/or parallel electric fields in the vicinity of the\nCluster-3 spacecraft during interval A. The weak convection\nmeasured by SuperDARN during interval A, when com-\npared with EDI, is consistent with numerous observations\nshowing weaker ionospheric electric fields and plasma\nflows at the location of active aurora relative to the wider\nvicinity [e.g.,Wescott et al., 1969; Rino et al., 1974; Weimer\net al., 1994; Yeoman et al., 2000; Bristow et al., 2001]. One\nexplanation for this phenomenon is that the magnetosphere\nmay not be able to maintain current continuity during\nperiods of enhanced auroral precipitation, necessitating the\ngeneration of parallel electric fields.\n[35] We have also examined whether the measurements\nobtained by FGM and EDI on Cluster-3 are consistent with\nthose obtained on the other Cluster spacecraft (Note: the\nCluster-4EDI did not collect data on this day).During interval\nA, Cluster-3 was separated from Cluster-1, Cluster-2,\nand Cluster-4 by distances of 532, 540, and 1010 km,\nrespectively. Cluster-2, Cluster-3, and Cluster-4 followed\nsimilar trajectories, with Cluster-3 leading and Cluster-4\ntrailing. Cluster-1 was in a separate trajectory that led the\nother three spacecraft at a slightly higher altitude. FGM\nmeasurements from all four spacecraft show evidence of\nsimilar field-aligned current sheet crossings. The structure of\nthe currents seen by Cluster-1 is somewhat different from\nFigure 9.

Vertical lines indicate auroral onsets at 0726 and\n0741 UT.\nA01209 BAKER ET AL.: CONJUGATE COMPARISON OF PLASMA DRIFT MEASUREMENTS\n15 of 20\nA01209\nthose seen by the other spacecraft but this is consistent with\nit having a unique trajectory at a higher altitude. The FGM\nmeasurements on Cluster-2 and Cluster-4 are qualitatively\nsimilar to those from Cluster-3; however, there are slight\ndifferences that suggest temporal and\/or spatial variations in\nthe strength of the field-aligned currents. In particular, the\ncurrents measured by Cluster-2 and Cluster-4 are stronger\nthan those measured by Cluster-3. This is consistent with the\nsmall-scale temporal and spatial variability of geomagnetic\nand auroral activity measured on the ground. Likewise, the\nEDI measurements on Cluster-1 and Cluster-2 are similar to\nthose obtained on Cluster-3, in an average sense, if one\nneglects high-frequency variations and spikes. All three EDI\ninstruments measured strong flows directed toward the\nplasma sheet and dusk.\n[36] In summary, FGM measurements are consistent with\na crossing of field-aligned current sheets just prior to\ninterval A, and ground-based measurements show signifi-\ncant auroral precipitation and geomagnetic disturbance\noccurring on magnetic field lines connected to the Clus-\nter-3 spacecraft. The region of inconsistency between\nSuperDARN and EDI is certainly spatially localized and\nperhaps temporally localized to some extent as well. Be-\ncause there is a well-defined link between observations of\nauroral precipitation, field-aligned currents, and parallel\nelectric fields [e.g., Knight, 1973; Olsson et al., 1998] it\nis tempting to conclude that Cluster-3 passed through or\nabove a localized region of parallel electric field at the\npoleward edge of the field-aligned current sheets. Inductive\nelectric fields associated with substorm phenomena and\ntwisting of the magnetic geometry by the presence of the\nfield-aligned currents may also have contributed to the\ninconsistency.\n5.2. Interval B (0930\u20131000 UT)\n[37] During interval B the Cluster-3 ionospheric foot\npoint was at the highest latitudes of the polar cap (see\nFigure 6b). The dR parameter was large, signifying poor\ncoverage of SuperDARN convection measurements in the\nvicinity of the Cluster-3 ionospheric foot point. Under these\ncircumstances, the SuperDARN estimates for the drift\nvelocities at Cluster-3 are driven more by the statistical\nconvection model of Ruohoniemi and Greenwald [1996],\nthan actual measurements. The optimized foot points tech-\nnique produces some improvement in the correspondence\nbetween EDI and SuperDARN, but the optimized foot point\nlocations still lie within the area of poor spatial coverage.\nWe are therefore hesitant to place too much significance on\nthe improvement in this case. We instead conclude that the\nEDI-SuperDARN inconsistency probably has little or no\ngeophysical significance during interval B and can be\nwholly attributed to inadequate spatial coverage of iono-\nspheric convection in the vicinity of the Cluster-3 foot\npoint.\n5.3. Interval C (1005\u20131020 UT)\n[38] During interval C the Cluster-3 spacecraft was at\n6.4 RE altitude and its ionospheric foot point moved from\nthe dayside polar cap toward the noon-sector auroral zone,\napproaching (but not yet entering) a region in which there\nwas exceptional SuperDARN coverage of ionospheric con-\nvection (see Figure 6c). Just prior to 1000 UT, EDI started\nto measure stronger flows in the sunward and antisunward\ndirections (see Figure 7). At 1014 UT a particularly strong\nburst of sunward convection was measured that exceeded\n17 km\/s. We focus our attention on this largest burst of\nsunward convection. By comparison, the SuperDARN esti-\nmates for the convection at Cluster-3 during this time show\nincreased convection in the antisunward, rather than sun-\nward, direction. The strength of the burst and the short\ntemporal scale over which it existed is very suggestive of a\nshort-lived dynamic influence that might have operated in\nthe magnetosphere during this time. If this were the case,\nthen inductive electric fields associated with dynamic var-\niations in the magnetic fields would not map to the\nionosphere along magnetic field lines and could be respon-\nsible for EDI-SuperDARN inconsistencies.\n[39] A possible source for the convection burst can be\nidentified in the interplanetary measurements. Figure 3\nshows a sudden decrease in solar wind dynamic pressure\nthat impinged on the magnetosphere at approximately\n1010\u20131014 UT. This was accompanied by transient\nincreases in the IMF By and Bz components that may also\nhave played a role in the generation of the flow burst\nmeasured at Cluster-3. The discussion here is focused on\nthe decrease in pressure because it has the clearest step-\nlike signature. We can be reasonably confident of the\ntiming of the arrival of the pressure decrease at Cluster-3\nbecause it produced a sudden 10\u201312 nT decrease in the\nstrength of the GSM Bx component and a similar increase\nin the GSM Bz component measured by the FGM instru-\nment at 1010\u20131014 UT (Figure 4 shows some of this\nvariation relative to the T01 model magnetic field). The\nmagnetic variations are consistent with a sunward spring-\ning of the magnetic field at Cluster-3 in response to the\nrapid drop in solar wind dynamic pressure. This sunward\ndisplacement would have an associated dawnward induc-\ntive electric field. If the magnitude of the inductive electric\nfield were 1 mV\/m, it would fully explain the burst of\nsunward velocity measuring 17 km\/s, and the burst would\nnot be observed in the ionosphere. The fact that a small\nburst was measured in the ionosphere suggests that there\nwas an electrostatic component to the increased electric\nfield observed at Cluster-3.\n[40] During interval C the Cluster spacecraft were flying\nin a tetrahedron formation with Cluster-3 separated from\nCluster-1, Cluster-2, and Cluster-4 by 265, 436, and\n880 km, respectively. Cluster-3 was the most sunward of\nthe spacecraft; it was trailed by Cluster-1 at a slightly\nhigher altitude; while Cluster-2 and (last) Cluster-4 fol-\nlowed along a similar trajectory to Cluster-3. The magnetic\nresponse to the decrease in dynamic pressure was measured\nsimultaneously by FGM on all four Cluster spacecraft (not\nshown). A similar but slightly weaker burst of sunward\nconvection was measured by EDI on Cluster-1 and Cluster-2\nat the same time as that observed at Cluster-3. There were\nsome differences in fine structure between the bursts\nmeasured by EDI on all three spacecraft, particularly at\nthe time when the main burst was decaying at 1015 UT and\na smaller duskward burst was initiating (see Figure 7). This\nsecondary duskward burst was also measured at Cluster-1\nand Cluster-2 but at successive 30-s intervals later than it\nwas at Cluster-3. We can therefore conclude that the\nsecondary burst was spatially localized and\/or might have\nA01209 BAKER ET AL.: CONJUGATE COMPARISON OF PLASMA DRIFT MEASUREMENTS\n16 of 20\nA01209\npropagated between the spacecraft. However, over the\n5-min timescale that the large sunward burst evolved, both\nFGM and EDI measurements were qualitatively similar and\nsimultaneous on all spacecraft, suggesting that the primary\nsunward burst existed on a large spatial scale and may well\nhave been associated with the magnetospheric response to\nthe sudden reduction in solar wind dynamic pressure\nmeasured at ACE.\n[41] Ground-based measurements from the IMAGE mag-\nnetometer network in Scandinavia show the decrease in\ndynamic pressure arrived at a time of preexisting high-\nlatitude dayside geomagnetic activity. Figure 11 shows the x\ncomponent (geographic northward) magnetic disturbance\nmeasured by 11 IMAGE stations between 0800 and\n1100 UT. The 11 stations are distributed in a north\u2013south\nchain from NAL at (78.92\u0004N, 11.95\u0004E) to Nurmijarvi (NUR)\nat 60.50\u0004N, 24.65\u0004E. The location of NAL is represented in\nFigure 6c as the asterisk and it can be seen that Cluster-3 was\napproaching this location during interval C. Starting at\n0930 UT, the x component started to increase steadily at\nthe highest-latitude stations, suggesting a strengthening of\nthe overhead eastward electrojet. There were also \u000e12 min\nperiod Pc 5 oscillations throughout the interval, which were\ncoherent with similar oscillations in the y and z components\n(not shown). High-latitude Pc 5 oscillations are often inter-\npreted in terms of active solar wind interactions at the\nmagnetopause, such as the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability,\ndynamic pressure variations, and flux-transfer events [e.g.,\nEngebretson et al., 1995]. At the time of the sunward burst\nof convection measured by EDI at 1014 UT, there was a\nsudden increase in the strength of the Pc 5 oscillations and\ntheir period increased to 15\u201318 min; this pressure change\nFigure 11. The X component (geographic northward) magnetic disturbance measured between 0800\nand 1100 UT on 12 March 2001 by a north-south chain of IMAGE network magnetometers.\nA01209 BAKER ET AL.: CONJUGATE COMPARISON OF PLASMA DRIFT MEASUREMENTS\n17 of 20\nA01209\nalso marks the start of a sustained period of equatorward\nmigration of the eastward electrojet. The ground-based\nmagnetometer measurements therefore suggest that the burst\nof sunward convection occurred while Cluster-3 was\napproaching a region that was coupled to active wave\nprocesses in the magnetosphere, possibly generated at the\nmagnetopause. Unfortunately, ground-based auroral imag-\ning data were not available during this period to confirm the\nexistence of discrete auroral arcs on Cluster-3 magnetic field\nlines. However, measurements from the imaging riometer\nfor ionospheric studies (IRIS) imaging riometer at Kilpis-\njarvi do show an increase in absorption starting at around\n1016 UT (not shown), consistent with enhanced dayside\nauroral precipitation during this time.\n[42] In summary, a sudden sunward burst of convection\nwas measured by EDI during interval C.We postulate that the\nsource of the burst was a sudden decrease in solar wind\ndynamic pressure that allowed a sunward motion of the\ndayside magnetopause and a sunward springing of the\nmagnetic field and plasma in the vicinity of all the Cluster\nspacecraft. Ground-based measurements show that the con-\nvection burst occurred while Cluster-3 was approaching\nmagnetic field lines that were coupled to active long-period\nwave processes, possibly on the magnetopause. At the same\ntime that EDI measured the sunward flow burst in the\nmagnetosphere, an antisunward burst was measured in the\nionosphere by SuperDARN. The technique of foot point\noptimization was unable to reconcile the inconsistency in the\nSuperDARN and EDI drift directions, suggesting that an\nelectrostatic mapping of electric fields along equipotential\nmagnetic field lines is insufficient during interval C. We\ntherefore conclude that a geophysical explanation for the\ninconsistency is necessary and postulate that the dominant\nsource is associated with the sudden drop in solar wind\ndynamic pressure. One element of the magnetospheric\nresponse to the pressure decrease would have been a short-\nlived inductive electric field that would not have mapped to\nthe ionosphere along magnetic field lines. The fact that a\nsmall antisunward burst was measured in the ionosphere\nsuggests that some component of the magnetospheric\nresponse at high altitude must have been electrostatic. The\ndirection of the burst in the ionosphere may have rotated with\nrespect to the burst at Cluster-3 because of the presence of\nlocalized parallel electric fields and\/or twisted magnetic flux\ntubes, also produced by the drop in dynamic pressure.\n5.4. Interval D (1100\u20131145 UT)\n[43] During interval D, Cluster-3 was conjugate to the\nnoon-sector convection throat region of the ionosphere,\nwhere zonal convection along the morning- and after-\nnoon-sector auroral zones converge and turn northward into\nthe polar cap (see Figure 6d). The spatial coverage of\nSuperDARN in the vicinity of the Cluster-3 foot point\nwas particularly good during this entire time. Despite this\nfact, the SuperDARN estimates for the convection at\nCluster-3 shown in Figure 7 consistently underestimate\nthe antisunward (\u0004X) sense of the flow, while simulta-\nneously over-estimating the dawnward (\u0004Y) flow in such a\nway that the overall strength of the convection is well\nrepresented. The procedure of foot point optimization\nyielded dramatic improvements within 400 km of the\nnominal T01 foot points, suggesting that the accuracy of\nthe T01 model might be principally responsible for the\ninconsistency in this case.\n[44] It is interesting to note that the optimized foot points\nare consistently poleward of the nominal T01 foot points by\n\u000e1\u0004 in magnetic latitude. In section 4.2, it was shown that\nthe T01 model became increasingly inaccurate in reproduc-\ning the FGM measurements during interval D as Cluster-3\napproached the dayside magnetopause. This was attributed\nto the fact that the T01 model does not take account of\nerosion of magnetic flux from the dayside magnetosphere\nduring extended periods of southward IMF. In particular, it\nwas shown that the T01 model incorrectly estimated a\ncrossing of the open-closed field line boundary during\ninterval D, whereas the FGM measurements suggested that\nCluster-3 stayed connected to the open tail lobe throughout.\nOne result of this discrepancy is that Cluster-3 foot points\nwould be shifted poleward of those specified by T01\nbecause the high-altitude ends of open field lines are\nconvected tailward by the solar wind, and hence, would\nbe encountered by Cluster-3 earlier than they would be if\nthey were closed. Erosion of flux from the dayside magne-\ntosphere can thus be invoked to explain the consistent\npoleward shift of the foot points during interval D. Alter-\nnatively, the poleward shift might result from the finite\nAlfven transit time between the magnetosphere and the\nionosphere. During interval D, Cluster-3 measured strong\nflows on flux tubes that were convecting into the polar cap\nwith an ionospheric velocity of \u000e700 m\/s. A poleward shift\nof \u000e1\u0004 in latitude is consistent with the distance these flux\ntubes would travel in a 1\u20132 min Alfven transit time from\nthe dayside magnetopause to the ionosphere, a commonly\nassumed value.\n6. Summary and Conclusions\n[45] A mathematical formalism has been presented that\ncan be used to compare conjugate measurements of plasma\nconvection obtained simultaneously in the magnetosphere\nand ionosphere. The method relies on the availability of an\naccurate magnetosphere-ionosphere mapping of magnetic\nfield lines and the assumption that the field lines can be\ntreated as electrostatic equipotentials. To demonstrate the\ntechnique we have presented an event study during 0700\u2013\n1200 UT on 12 March 2001 and compared plasma drift\nobservations from the SuperDARN ionospheric radars with\nmeasurements from the EDI experiment on the Cluster-3\nspacecraft. The Tsyganenko T01 magnetic field model was\nused to identify the magnetic foot points of the Cluster-3\nspacecraft in the northern ionosphere. During much of the\nevent interval there was good consistency between the EDI\nand SuperDARN observations. Significant inconsistencies\nwere identified during four subevent intervals labeled A\u2013D\nand have been explained in terms of one or more of the\nfollowing influences: (1) localized parallel electric fields;\n(2) inductive electric fields; and (3) limitations of the T01\nmodel.\n[46] In general, the T01 model provided a good repre-\nsentation of the Cluster-3 FGM magnetometer measure-\nments during the event period. However, on the dayside\nthere was evidence that T01 underestimated the magnetic\nflux in the tail lobe because of an inability to model the\ncumulative effects of magnetic flux erosion during a sus-\nA01209 BAKER ET AL.: CONJUGATE COMPARISON OF PLASMA DRIFT MEASUREMENTS\n18 of 20\nA01209\ntained period of southward IMF. By searching for improved\ncorrespondence between EDI and SuperDARN in locations\nremoved from the nominal foot point location it was\ndemonstrated how conjugate observations can be used to\ncorrect small errors in the magnetic mapping. Previous\nefforts to test the accuracy of magnetic field models have\nbeen based on either (1) comparing the model predictions\nwith numerous single-point in situ magnetic field measure-\nments [e.g., Fairfield, 1991; Peredo et al., 1993; Thomsen\net al., 1996] or (2) using particle measurements to test the\nmagnetic connectivity between two spacecraft [e.g., Hones\net al., 1996; Reeves et al., 1997; Weiss et al., 1997]. The\nformalism developed in this paper provides a new frame-\nwork with which to evaluate the performance of magnetic\nfield models and may lead to further model calibrations and\nrefinements.\n[47] The most interesting EDI-SuperDARN inconsisten-\ncies were identified during intervals A and C when partial\ndecoupling of convection in the magnetosphere and iono-\nsphere was most likely to have occurred. During interval A\nthe Cluster-3 spacecraft was conjugate to the midnight\nsector auroral zone at a time of increasing geomagnetic\nactivity associated with substorm-like phenomena. During\ninterval C the spacecraft was conjugate to the afternoon-\nsector polar cap, perhaps close to the open-closed magnetic\nfield line boundary and measured the effects of a sudden\ndrop in solar wind dynamic pressure at the magnetopause.\nThe decoupling of convection during these two intervals can\nbe explained by generation of parallel and\/or inductive\nelectric fields associated with dynamic processes in the\nmagnetosphere. If this type of decoupling is a common\nphenomenon it has serious implications for our ability to\nmonitor magnetospheric dynamics because the cross-polar\npotential measured at low altitude would not represent the\ntrue potential drop across the magnetosphere. This decou-\npling phenomenon can only be verified by analyzing\nconjugate observations of electric fields obtained simulta-\nneously in the magnetosphere and ionosphere, as has been\npresented here.\n[48] Future work will expand upon the principles devel-\noped in this paper and exploit the full multipoint capability\nof the Cluster mission. Using MHD models to specify\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere conjugacy, rather than the static\nT01 model, may improve the identification of inductive\nelectric fields. SuperDARN and EDI measurements will be\ncompared for events during quiet and active conditions in\ndifferent regions of the magnetosphere. Such a study will\nprovide a quantitative assessment of the occurrence rate of\npartial decoupled convection throughout the magneto-\nsphere-ionosphere system for different levels of geomag-\nnetic activity.\n[49] Acknowledgments.
