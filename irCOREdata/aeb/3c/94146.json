She has published widely in the field of ethnicity, \nrace and criminal justice. She is currently working on a study examining the \nconstruction and negotiation of ethnic and masculine identities among male \nprisoners in two prisons in the South East of England. \n 1\nIntroduction \n \nUnder New Labour \u2018race equality\u2019 has assumed a central place in the political agendas of \nthe criminal justice services. It was the catalytic public inquiry into the Metropolitan \nPolice Service\u2019s investigation into the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence and the \nsubsequent Macpherson Report (1999) which marked the turning point after the \u2018racism-\nblind\u2019 years of the Conservative government. It propelled racism into the political and \nmedia spotlight, and was followed by New Labour fully endorsing the Lawrence Inquiry \nteam\u2019s findings that \u2018institutional racism\u2019 had played a part in the flawed police \ninvestigation. The aftermath saw a (perhaps pre-emptive) scurry of senior criminal justice \nofficials, such as the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, the Director of the \nCrown Prosecution Service, and the Home Secretary, admitting the presence of \ninstitutional racism in their own organisations (The Guardian, Friday August 27, 1999; The \nGuardian, Thursday July 26, 2001; Straw 1999). During its first term of office, the \nelimination of institutional racism appeared at the centre of New Labour\u2019s policy rhetoric \n(see for example Home Office 1999). This has subsequently given way to a less radical \ndiscourse of promoting race equality and diversity (see for example Home Office 2005a). \nThe New Labour variant is concerned with ensuring equal access to services and \nemployment across the public sector. This is enshrined in the Race Relations \n(Amendment) Act 2000, which for the first time, brought the police service and other \npublic authorities into the ambit of race relations legislation.  \nThe Lawrence Inquiry also established unequivocally that there was a \nfundamental lack of trust between minority ethnic communities and the police. Minority \nethnic communities lacked confidence in the police service to act in a fair manner \ntowards them as victims, suspects, witnesses, and even as colleagues. The current paper is \nconcerned with the latter group and, specifically, the professional associations that have \n 2\nbeen established to represent the interests of minority ethnic employees working within \nthe police and other criminal justice services under the responsibility of the Home Office \nand Her Majesty\u2019s Prison Service. Like the earlier Scarman Report (1981) on the policing \nof black communities, Macpherson reiterated the symbolic and actual importance of \nincreasing the representation of minority ethnic officers in the police service. In better \nreflecting local multi-ethnic communities, police legitimacy would be increased, it was \nargued, and minority ethnic officers could be expected to act in ways which did not \nnegatively stereotype minority ethnic communities1. This epitomises the \u2018business case\u2019 \nfor race equality and diversity where organisations themselves benefit directly from a \nmore diverse workforce. Unlike the response to the Scarman Report which had not \nnetted more minority ethnic officers however, Macpherson\u2019s recommendations were \nbetter heeded by the government. New Labour\u2019s managerialist orientation resulted in the \nHome Secretary\u2019s Action Plan (Home Office 1999) with its explicit targets and \nmilestones established for improving the recruitment, retention and progression of \nminority ethnic staff across the criminal justice services.  \nThe Action Plan gave significant impetus to, and in some cases, funding for the \nwork of black and Asian professional associations2, set up in response to the well-\ndocumented negative experiences of minority ethnic practitioners who have faced \nmarginalisation, discrimination, and sometimes victimisation in the police, crown \nprosecution, probation, and prison services (Holdaway and O'Neill 2004, Holdaway \n1996, Cashmore 2001; Denman 2001, Francis-Spence 1995, Reardon 1993, HMIP 2000, \nAlfred 1992, McDermott 1990). Newly formed associations such as the National Black \nCrown Prosecutor\u2019s Association and The Association of Muslim Lawyers have emerged \nto sit alongside established ones such as the Society of Black Lawyers and the \nAssociation of Black Probation Officers. Undoubtedly the Macpherson Report (1999) \nprovided the spur for the emergence of these new professional associations, particularly \n 3\nthose such as the Network and Respect representing minority ethnic staff within \ngovernment.  \nThe research on which this article is based was concerned with the role and \ninfluence of black and Asian professional associations in developing more inclusive, anti-\ndiscriminatory employment practices in light of the Macpherson agenda. It does not \ndirectly address broader issues of equality and diversity, although it is acknowledged that \nrace equality has increasingly been subsumed under the general \u2018diversity banner\u2019 amidst \nclaims that anti-discriminatory approaches must encompass oppression on the grounds \nof gender, sexuality, religion\/faith and disability too (but see Wrench 2005; Phillips \nforthcoming). As well as providing support networks, mentoring, conferences, training, \nand social events for their members, the role of black and Asian professional associations \nhas become increasingly central to recruitment initiatives as the criminal justice services \nseek assistance in meeting the targets contained in the Home Secretary\u2019s Action Plan \n(1999). The research also centred on examining the extent to which professional \nassociations\u2019 work had extended their external focus beyond recruitment activities to \nimprove service delivery for minority ethnic individuals and communities as \u2018users\u20193 of \nthe criminal justice system. With the exception of Holdaway and McNeill\u2019s (2004) recent \nresearch on black police associations, these topics have not received empirical research \nattention. \nIn-depth interviews were conducted with the Chairs of the National Black Police \nAssociation, Metropolitan Police Service Black Police Association, National Association \nof Black Crown Prosecutors, Association of Black Probation Officers, National \nAssociation of Asian Probation Staff4, the Home Office Network and Respect (HM \nPrison Service), and two senior officials working within the Home Office on race \nequality and diversity issues5. A small case study of the Association of Black Probation \nOfficers6 entailed further interviews with five Executive Committee members, and the \n 4\nobservation of a small number of regional and national meetings, including the AGM in \nApril 20047. The interviews took place between June 2003 and June 2004. Each interview \nwas recorded and transcribed verbatim, then coded and analysed using QSR NUD*IST. \nIn an attempt to preserve anonymity, the interview quotes used throughout this paper \nhave not been individually attributed.  \nThe research offered an insight into how professional associations had responded \nto the race equality agenda in their own work, as well as affording an opportunity to \nexplore the nature of occupational racism in the criminal justice services in the post-\nMacpherson period. The article begins with an inward focus, examining the supportive \nfunction of black and Asian professional associations in relation to employment issues, \nbefore focusing externally on their role in community engagement and service delivery. \nIn so doing, the article considers the potential role of professional associations in \ncombating institutional racism as well as promoting race equality. The paper concludes \nwith a discussion of how ethnicity may act as a resource to enhance the delivery of \ncriminal justice services.  \n \nFacing inwards \nThe political and emotional significance of support \nBlack and Asian professional associations saw their primary role as providing a support \nnetwork for members who experienced racism and discrimination in their workplaces. \nThis was an enduring, central element of professional associations\u2019 raison d\u2019\u00eatre, many of \nwhom had formed under a Conservative government where racism within public \norganisations, particularly the powerful pillars of the establishment, such as the police \nand legal system, was barely acknowledged (Bowling and Phillips 2002, Bourne 2001). \nThe predominance of depoliticised multiculturalist policies amidst the ridiculing of anti-\nracist stances across the public sector during the period must have fostered a sense of \n 5\nmarginalisation among those experiencing discrimination within criminal justice \nemployment settings (Bonnett 2000, Gordon 1990). Interviewees\u2019 accounts and views \nexpressed at the Association of Black Probation Officers\u2019 AGM showed that long-\nstanding members had a shared memory steeped in historical instances of their own or \ncolleagues\u2019 experiences of discrimination and harassment in their criminal justice work \nenvironments. This legacy of occupational racism led to the prioritisation of the \nsupportive function of the black and Asian professional associations. This was seen as a \nfundamental mainstay or the \u2018bread and butter\u2019 of organisational business. The strength \nof feeling regarding this role is expressed by one interviewee from the Association of \nBlack Probation Officers: \n \nIf you take the issue of support away from ABPO [Association of \nBlack Probation Officers] and there is a climate of institutionalised \nracism, then there is no ABPO\u2026 if your colleagues are still facing \nwhat they are facing\u2026 and as I said, twelve years on for me, since \npeople are being constantly put through the mill of rough times, \npeople going off sick, people leaving because they feel that they are \ngoing to be sacked, I had all of that, working with such an \nundercurrent, and we are not there to support them and progress                                                        \nmatters\u2026I think that there won't be an ABPO for me anymore.       \n \n 6\nThis support offered to members can be seen as having both a political and an \nemotional dimension. Interacting with professional colleagues from minority ethnic \ngroups enabled members to feel part of a racialised collectivity and minority grouping \nwithin each criminal justice service, a process similarly described by Holdaway and \nMcNeill (2004) in their history of black police associations. It both redefined negative \noccupational experiences as discriminatory at the organisational rather than individual \nlevel and unequivocally accepted perceived experiences of racist practice: \n \nMy motivation to join was as a black person living and working in \n[home county] and going through the trainee process again in [home \ncounty], I had had difficulties in that process\u2026 And for the first time \nI was now talking to people who said \u2018Oh yeah that is usual. They like \nto fail... black people who are in the system. That is what happens. \nThey question your English, they question your writing, this is what \nhappens\u2019\u2026. I went from feeling 'Oh oh I am a failure to OK, this is \noppressive practice.' And it was a reversal then, because it became \u2018oh, \nok, all right I am not so bad after all.\u2019  \nMembership thus provided a means for resisting the marginalization of ethnicity and \nracism, particularly in relation to internal employment practices within the criminal \njustice services. The need for collective support and reassurance from \u2018your own people\u2019 \nor to find \u2018someone there that I could talk to, who could understand what I was going \nthrough\u2019, to know \u2018it is not just you that feels like that\u2019 was often referred to by \ninterviewees in this study and that conducted by Holdaway and O\u2019Neill (2004). This was \nparticularly the case where members worked in isolated offices as lone minority ethnic \nmembers of staff. The commonality of racialised experience created a safe space for \nmembers where they could express their feelings without being judged or challenged. \n 7\nThis recognises the bonds and sense of belonging that ethnicity provides members with \n(see Barth 1969; Tomlins, Johnson and Owen 2002).  \nThe nature and level of support offered by professional associations varied, being \nlargely determined by the extent of funding received for this work. At a minimum, \nsupport slots at regional meetings allowed members to seek emotional support and \nreassurance, advice or advocacy regarding incidents of discrimination. These would be \nunminuted with the floor open for attendees to discuss their particular issues. \nAlternatively, members could contact local or national offices to request more formal \nsupport or representation. Telephone and face-to-face contact would be made with local \nmembers who had received representational or member support training to assist on a \none-to-one basis, outlining options for members to consider. This work, whilst \nconsidered vital, was also extremely demanding, particularly when dealing with members \nwho were very distressed. Where members were involved in a grievance or were subject \nto disciplinary procedures, the representational work could also be protracted, involving \nunions and senior management. In the case of the Association of Black Probation \nOfficers, for example, trained professional association staff worked as advocates for \nmembers, often alongside their union representative, but focusing specifically on race \nequality issues. This work required a sensitivity with one interviewee describing his \nstrategy as one which avoided using the racism label unless absolutely necessary, even \nwhen racism was believed to be the cause of the dispute:  \n \nMy experience is that if you go in there shouting race and they just \nshut up and all of the shutters come down and it is like us against \nthem\u2026I use the race discrimination bit as a last resort. I will go \nthrough all of the other stuff about career progression, discriminatory \npractice. I don't use the black word unless I have to because what I've \n 8\nnoticed from my experience is that you mention that and all of the \nbarriers go up. You are just playing the race card again. And if it is \nvalid, I will use it, but if I think that there are other ways of winning \nthis...I will use discrimination. And you can pin it on that because that \ncould happen to anybody. And I have found that managers are more \nopen when you start talking discrimination. I may be thinking black \ndiscrimination but they are thinking discrimination per se, I have an \ninterest in this.                            \n \nMainstream trades unions across the criminal justice sector were almost \nuniversally8 criticised by interviewees for failing to respond adequately to issues of race \nequality and discrimination, and therefore providing a poor service to minority ethnic \nmembers. Whilst there was recognition of the need to work strategically with established \nunions and professional associations, with signs of more recent positive relationships, \nmany of the black and Asian professional associations reported hostility to their \nformation. They were regarded as both divisive and \u2018stepping on the toes\u2019 of unions and \ntheir traditional business of representing staff, although they saw their role as \ncomplementary and as filling a gap not met by unions. There was a commonly held view \nthat unions were slow to take on board the race equality agenda with insufficient internal \nexpertise to meet minority ethnic members\u2019 even basic employment needs. One \ninterviewee discussed the arrangement of an important local union meeting to discuss \nindustrial action which had been scheduled during the Diwali festival, thus effectively \nexcluding some Asian members of staff from expressing their views. There was also a \nresidual suspicion that the mainstream unions were dragging their feet on race equality \nissues because they had to accommodate the majority views of their membership, \nincluding some white members who held racially prejudiced attitudes. This, from one \n 9\ninterviewee:  \n \nwe work closely with them and we go to their conferences. We invite \nthem to ours. They would never dream of putting me on one of their \nplatforms at their conference. Never. Still. The culture is such.... they \nhave a reserve position for women on the [union] nationally. They will \nrefuse point blank to have a black representative. And they had a big \nmotion vote a few years ago and it got voted out. And they all clapped \nand everything else, in their hundreds. \n \nSupport for black and Asian members also took the form of assistance with career \ndevelopment. This might involve specific training events such as mock promotion \ninterviews or inviting human resources colleagues to address regional meetings. The \nHome Office Network had run clinics to assist members through the promotion process \nfrom application to assessment centre, while one of Respect\u2019s training events had \nfocused on personal influence, negotiation and conflict resolution. The National \nAssociation of Crown Prosecutors had provided training for members to help them \nchallenge prejudice within the office without recourse to formal action. Training events, \nwhilst again limited by resources, appeared to be highly valued by members above in-\nservice courses. More informal mentoring was also in operation within the case study, the \nAssociation of Black Probation Officers. Interviewees discussed how they worked with \nmembers, often in their own time, to help them present themselves in a favourable light \nfor promotion or to access further development opportunities.  \n \n 10\nForms of discrimination post-Macpherson  \nAt the heart of the supportive work undertaken by black and Asian professional \nassociations was a perception of the continuity of racism within the criminal justice \nservices. This was despite the political focus on race equality which has infused the \nagendas of the criminal justice services since the Macpherson Report (1999). However, \nthere was a welcome acknowledgement of a sea change in the way in which services \nresponded to claims of discriminatory practice with more proactive engagement with \nrace equality issues, not least because of statutory obligations under the Race Relations \n(Amendment) Act 2000. As public authorities, criminal justice services were required to \npromote equality of opportunity, to proactively promote good relations between people \nof different racial groups, and to publish a race equality scheme. This also meant that \nthey had to audit, consult, and monitor existing policies and services to assess whether \nthese impacted differently on different ethnic groups, either as recipients of services or as \nemployees.  \nNonetheless, interviewees described negative employment experiences that they \nfelt amounted to direct forms of discrimination against minority ethnic members of staff. \nInterviewees in this study provided examples of members suffering a range of \ndiscriminatory experiences which tended to be more subtle than pre-Macpherson forms \nof discrimination such as explicit racist abuse or the wearing of racist insignia in the \nworkplace. Whilst this study is small-scale and inevitably biased towards including the \nperspectives of those who have directly encountered employment discrimination, it \nchimes with findings from a wide range of independent sources, including empirical \nresearch, inspections and investigations carried out by service inspectorates or other \ninquiry teams (Cashmore 2001, 2002; Holder, Nee and Ellis 2000; HMIC 1997; HMIP \n2000; 2002; Denman 2001; The Zahid Mubarek Public Inquiry 2005, The Morris Inquiry \n2004, CRE 2003, 2005). \n 11\n One of the most commonly cited forms of inequality was minority ethnic \ncolleagues being disadvantaged either by being given impossible tasks to perform or by \ntheir being inadequately supervised or trained in particular work areas. As the following \nexcerpt makes clear, such tasks were seen as being disproportionately allocated to \nminority ethnic colleagues, either in an unthinking way or deliberately to publicly reveal \nincompetent performance: \n \nShe should be breaking her teeth on little careless driving. Or drinking \nand driving. Do you know what I mean? They were giving her like \ndeception trials\u2026and they were giving her them consistently. And \nthen they thought she was incompetent, because if you keep losing, \nshe loses her confidence\u2026the kind of issues that I have seen \nthroughout my career are.... they will give you a murder case... no \ntraining. Yeah. So it is a sink or swim. I have always said there is a fine \nline between development and dumping. So they think this is helping \nand they give you a case, no training... so they set you up to fail. And \nalso another thing is they are given the heaviest courts. \nWorking within a different criminal justice service area, another interviewee described \nblack managers being brought into lead historically poorly performing teams, with \nunrealistic expectations as to how quickly these teams could be turned around to perform \nat the desired level. \nJudgements on work performance were also believed to be more severe in \nrelation to minority ethnic professionals resulting in unfair disciplinary charges being \nbrought. This extended to minority ethnic staff feeling undervalued regarding the \ncontributions they made to their organisations. One Chairperson reflected on their \nassociation\u2019s success in reducing racist jokes and banter in the workplace, but they felt \n 12\nthey had so far failed in eliminating the institutionally racist ways in which appraisals were \nwritten and bonuses were awarded. Although this form of discrimination was much \nmore difficult to pin down and provide evidence for, there was a belief that the wording \nof appraisals for two similarly performing staff members would convey satisfactory \nperformance for a minority ethnic staff member but be described by a manager as \nexemplary in the case of a white member of staff. Another interviewee referred to a \nnumber of cases where formal representation had been requested where individuals were \nbeing disciplined for failing to meet targets. Further investigation had revealed that other \nwhite team members were performing at the same or nearly the same level but were not \nsubject to disciplinary charges. In the case of minority ethnic staff members the \nbenchmark had been regional or national targets with no consideration of local \nperformance. \nThe more formal route to dealing with poor performance was also seen as \nanother way in which minority ethnic staff members were disadvantaged compared with \ntheir white counterparts. As the Morris Inquiry (2004) found in investigating the \nMetropolitan Police Service\u2019s employment standards and procedures, several \nChairpersons reported minority ethnic members being formally proceeded against at an \nearlier stage than might be generally expected. Poor performance by minority ethnic \nmembers of staff was seemingly less likely to be tackled via structured supervision, \ndevelopment or training so that they were not given the opportunity to improve their \nperformance before formal action was taken, leading to feelings of victimisation. The \nMorris Inquiry (2004) suggested that this was because managers lacked confidence in \nmanaging minority ethnic members of staff, demonstrating \u2018management by retreat\u2019 as \nthey were fearful and anxious about managing colleagues who were \u2018different\u2019.  \n 13\nAs also emerged in the Denman (2001) inquiry into the Crown Prosecution \nService, another form of discrimination highlighted by interviewees was inequitable \naccess to development opportunities, such as \u2018acting up\u2019, which later assisted in securing \npromotion. In considering changes in the extent and nature of racial discrimination pre- \nand post-Macpherson, one interviewee had the following to say: \nthey weren't calling names or the laddish bullying type management, \nthat reduced. But we found that they were withdrawing from the \nmember of staff what was really due to them\u2026They weren't getting \nthe postings. They weren't getting the certain type of job that would \ndevelop them. And we found that, you know, it was a lot more \ninsidious. It was a lot more sophisticated.                             \nPassive management where staff\u2019s careers were not proactively developed was perceived \nto disproportionately affect minority ethnic members of staff, hence the significance of \ninformal mentoring and career development provided via black and Asian professional \nassociations.  \nFinally, the more familiar forms of discrimination or negative stereotyping were still \npresent as the following extracts from the interviews demonstrates: \n\u2026this colleague was going through such a process in this building  \nwhere if he went for a home visit, somebody phoned him to check \nwhether he was where he said he was. Even though it is not their job. \nAnd that went on for months to a point where they would accuse him \nof going home when he was supposed to be doing home visiting\u2026  \nAnd on one occasion he was so annoyed that he gave the phone to the \noffender and said 'please speak to my people at work to confirm that I \nam sitting in your living room.'  \n \n 14\nI am properly dressed with my hair done, and my bag and my \nbriefcase and I will walk up.... and I will say 'where is the breach court \nor where is the court entrance?' and they will say to me 'have you got a \nsolicitor'.... automatically\u2026You feel disempowered. \n \nWhilst the interviews indicated the continued presence of racism, witting and \nunwitting, within the criminal justice services, there was some cause for optimism with \nmany recognising positive improvements in workplace relations with the support of \nsome white colleagues, and better mechanisms in place to challenge discriminatory \nemployment practices. Nowhere was this more evident than at a regional professional \nassociation meeting attended where, when directly asked to highlight issues for \nconsideration to be put before Home Office ministers discussing race equality in the \ncriminal justice system, participants raised a number of employment-related issues such \nas changes to probation officer training, volume of work, and the pay structure, all of \nwhich would have undoubtedly been raised by a meeting of white staff.  \n \nRecruitment and career progression \nIn their study of black police associations, Holdaway and McNeill (2004) noted \nthe way in which professional associations came to be seen by senior managers within \nthe police service as a means of confronting the collective problem of institutional racism \nin the aftermath of the Lawrence Inquiry (1999). Specifically they have had a key role in \nrecruitment activities as chief constables have been keen to ensure they meet the Home \nSecretary\u2019s targets on the recruitment, promotion and retention of minority ethnic police \nofficers (see also Bland et al. 1999). As Holdaway and McNeill have observed, this marks \na change from earlier practice uncovered in research by Holdaway (1991) where minority \nethnic officers were reluctant to encourage individuals into an occupation which \n 15\nroutinely discriminated against them. While this demonstrates real progress, it is worth \nremembering that as recently as September 2003 the National Black Police Association \nthreatened to advise all member associations around the country to withdraw from \nrecruitment efforts until serious efforts were made by police services to tackle racism. \nThe recruitment boycott imposed by the Metropolitan Police Service Black Police \nAssociation ended at the start of the Morris Inquiry (2004) into professional standards, \ngrievance procedures and diversity issues. This notwithstanding, the black and Asian \nprofessional associations across the criminal justice sector, have been actively involved in \nrecruitment efforts, often providing a dedicated stand at recruitment fairs or organising \nlocal and regional events. Moreover, as several interviewees commented, their \u2018spreading \nof the word\u2019 about the value of working within the criminal justice services in their own \ncommunities \u2013 whilst out shopping or attending community events - was perceived as \neven more important than any formally organised activities as a means of recruiting new \nminority ethnic members of staff.  \n The current research concurred with Holdaway and McNeill\u2019s (2004) findings \nwith interviewees wanting more minority ethnic individuals to join and progress within \ntheir services. Research participants demonstrated commitment to their services and \nconsiderable professional pride in their jobs, at the same time as wanting to find ways to \neliminate racism within their organisations. In some senses the problem of occupational \nracism had moved on to career progression and the persistent failure of the criminal \njustice services to advance minority ethnic members of staff (see also Home Office \n2005b). This was explicitly acknowledged with some interviewees discussing their \nprofessional association\u2019s training and development events for junior staff and middle \nmanagers to facilitate their future progression, which in turn would open up \nopportunities to influence organisational cultures. Whilst career progress was regarded as \na problem in and of itself it was also inextricably linked to recruitment, with a lack of \n 16\nsenior role models seen as hampering attempts to attract minority ethnic groups into the \ncriminal justice services (see also Stone and Tuffin 2002). Moreover, whilst the targets for \nlower grade employees might be exceeded, it was not \u2018just a numbers thing\u2019 as the \nfollowing interviewee recognised: \nmy main concern about hitting the targets is it is relatively easy, in fact, \nto hit the targets if you are recruiting at AA [Administrative Assistant] \nlevel.... But an AA has no influence apart from the filing that they \ndo...No one has to listen to them. And it easy to say we have hit the \ntargets, but only if the target is nobody who is actually going to change \nthe culture in your organisation. \nFor critical commentators, such as Bourne (2001: 12) even \u2018changing the colour of the \nincumbent, however, does not necessarily change the colour of the policy\u2019. Her concerns \nlie with the structures and cultures of organisations such as the police which allow \noperational racism in organisational practices, a concern exemplified in Macpherson\u2019s \n(1999) definition of institutional racism. The last part of this paper considers how black \nand Asian professional associations can play a part in challenging the institutionally racist \nculture of criminal justice organisations, such that they have an impact on service delivery \nfor users of criminal justice services \u2013 victims, witnesses, suspects, defendants and \nprisoners - as well as employees.  \n \nFacing outwards \n\u2018Institutional racism\u2019 and racial equality  \nProbably the most politically controversial conclusion of the Macpherson Report (1999: \npara. 34) was that institutional racism was partially responsible for the failed investigation \ninto Stephen Lawrence\u2019s murder and that it was endemic to public organisations such as \nthe police service. This stood in direct contrast to Scarman\u2019s (1981) earlier report on the \n 17\nBrixton riots which had rejected the claim of an institutionally racist police service, \ninstead positing the problem as one of a few \u2018rotten apples\u2019 (see Bowling and Phillips \n2002). The definition of institutional racism used in the Macpherson Report perceived \npublic institutions to be collectively failing minority ethnic individuals by not providing \n\u201can appropriate and professional service\u2026because of their colour, culture, or ethnic \norigin.\u201d Institutional racism could be seen in \u201cprocesses, attitudes and behaviour which \namount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and \nracist stereotyping\u201d. Certainly this research, conducted five years after the Macpherson \nReport, has uncovered continuing instances of unwitting prejudice (unfairly appraising \nthe job performance of black staff), ignorance and thoughtlessness (holding a union \nmeeting during Diwali), and racist stereotyping (assuming a black person attending court \nis a defendant rather than a criminal justice professional). However, these elements are \nreally examples of direct or indirect racial discrimination legally defined in the Race \nRelations Act 1976 with little reference to the structural and institutional dimensions of \nracism suggested by the label itself (if not explicitly by Macpherson). Indeed, as Bourne \n(2001: 15) has noted, this lack of clarity has precipitated public organisations\u2019 tendency to \nrespond to the Macpherson agenda with \u2018formulaic anti-racism\u2019 \u2013 ethnic monitoring and \nrecruitment policies - rather than critically examining the ways in which policies and \norganisational processes serve to routinely disadvantage minority ethnic groups. In large \npart the blame for this conceptual and definitional imprecision lies with Macpherson and \nhis team. As many critiques have contended, the Macpherson definition actually \nconflated institutional racism with individual prejudice and discriminatory behaviour (Lea \n2000; Anthias 1999; see also Mason 1982; Miles and Brown 2003, and it failed to \nacknowledge the role of the state in reproducing racism within public institutions \n(Bourne 2001).  \n New Labour\u2019s response to the Macpherson Report (1994) was a plethora of \n 18\npolicy proposals which centre on achieving racial equality, of opportunity and not \noutcome9. Less politically controversial than the elimination of institutional racism, the \npolicy approach has been one which attempts to level the playing field for all ethnic \ngroups so they can complete equally for social rewards \u2013 in this case employment or  \nequal access to services. Framed by the requirements of the Race Relations (Amendment) \nAct 2000, initiatives have included reviewing and assessing services\u2019 policies and \nfunctions to assess their impact on race equality, rigorous ethnic monitoring of policy \noutcomes, racism awareness training, specialised training for particular service elements \n(e.g. prosecuting racially\/religiously aggravated crime), and of course, improving the \nrecruitment, retention and career progression of minority ethnic staff. It is not, therefore, \nsurprising that the role of many of the black and Asian professional associations studied \nin this research has involved having an input into these types of activities. \nThe extent to which the black and Asian professional associations have been able \nto influence the organisational culture of the criminal justice services through changes in \nwider policy and practice was hard to gauge in a small-scale study such as this which did \nnot directly examine decision-making on policy and service delivery. At the local level, \nprevious research on anti-racist political struggles has suggested they tend to be \nmarginalised within the local political machinery (Ben-Tovim, et al. 1986). More \npositively, in the current research there was some evidence that black and Asian \nprofessional associations were represented on key committees concerned with national \npolicy-making and service delivery, particularly in relation to employment practices, and \nmost had made critical but constructive contributions to local or national race equality \nand diversity strategies. Several interviewees recognised that this external focus was \nentwined with the negative experiences minority ethnic staff members had as employees. \nAs one Chairperson explained: \n \n 19\nit was quite clear to us that there is an inextricable link between \ninternal staff confidence and interaction and external community \nperceptions and service delivery.\u2026we saw that you can't separate the \ntwo...because of the issue that we were experiencing with the \norganisation there was a reflection of what was going on in service \ndelivery so.... it just seemed to be common sense to keep the two \nconnected.     \nMore specifically, using the example of the probation service, the Association of Black \nProbation Officers and the National Association of Asian Probation Staff were part of \nthe service\u2019s main strategy committee, various service delivery committees, and had been \nadvisory group members for the thematic inspection on race equality work. This covered \nemployment practices and probation work with minority ethnic offenders and racially \nmotivated offenders (Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation 2000, 2004). Such \nexamples represent meaningful ways in which black and Asian professional associations \nhave been able to have a critical input into decision-making within the criminal justice \nservices, which in the longer term may bring about positive changes in organizational \ncultures (see also Stubbs (1985) research on black workers\u2019 groups in social services \ndepartments).  \nThis leads on to the more politically complex role for black and Asian \nprofessional associations in challenging the institutional dynamics of racism from within \nthe criminal justice services. On the one hand, their state funding and employee position \nplaces them in rather ambiguous territory to be highlighting institutionally racist practices \n(see Phillips forthcoming). On the other hand, their professional commitment and their \nability to act as a \u2018critical friend\u2019 means they are well placed to critique existing policies \nand propose new structures and practices which are operationally feasible. This might \ninvolve, for example, ensuring their involvement in assessing the race equality impact of \n 20\npolicies and functions, a measure required under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act \n2000. The Crown Prosecution Service, for example, has already established a Critical \nFriends\u2019 Group of officers and representatives from staff networks including the \nNational Association of Black Crown Prosecutors, which is consulted on \ndisproportionality in CPS decision-making (at charge, bail, mode of trial, failed cases, \ndiscontinuance, plea and plea bargaining). A role for the Association of Black Probation \nOfficers and the National Association of Asian Probation Staff could also be envisaged, \nas current practice indicates that much impact assessment work in the probation service \nhas been carried out internally by staff (see Wells and Barr 2003). In the police service \nthis could include guaranteed representation on scrutiny panels concerned with exploring \ndisproportionality in stop and search practices10. The problem of the institutionalisation \nof stop and search as a key indicator of productivity implicitly used by supervisors (see \nCashmore 2001; FitzGerald 1999) which can inflate disproportionality, could form part \nof a broader discussion about institutional racism within policing (see Bridges 2000).  \n \nEthnicity as a resource \nReturning to the Macpherson Report\u2019s (1999) definition of institutional racism, a further \nopportunity to inform service delivery is framed by the need to provide \u201can appropriate \nand professional service\u201d to minority ethnic groups. In their study of the housing careers \nof Vietnamese communities in London, Tomlinson, Johnson and Owen (2002) \nconceptualise ethnicity as a resource which operates to satisfy housing need. The bonds \nprovided by ethnicity, for example, common language and behaviour patterns, served to \nencourage clustering in particular locations creating housing demand. Information \nexchange, social and religious activities, the provision of specialist community resources \nsuch as shops and places of worship all reinforced ethnic ties and promoted a positive \nethnic identity, which in turn, attracted other Vietnamese households to these locations. \n 21\nSpecialist Vietnamese housing associations used the resource of ethnicity to respond to \nthe specific housing needs of Vietnamese communities, and in supplying housing they \nprovided culturally sensitive housing services such as first language front-line services \nand more flexible property types. Holdaway and McNeill\u2019s (2004) study of black police \nassociations similarly conceptualises ethnicity as a managerial resource for chief \nconstables to fulfil their commitments on employment policy and practice.  \nThe idea of ethnicity as a resource can be further extended to provide a \nmechanism in which black and Asian professional associations can draw on their \nmembers\u2019 cultural knowledge and multi-lingualism to improve criminal justice services \nfor users (see Bowling, et al. 2005 discussion of this in an international perspective). \nMembers of the black and Asian professional associations representing probation service \nstaff, for example, had played a major role in establishing specialist groupwork \nprogrammes for black and Asian probation clients. In the policing context, the \nMetropolitan Police Service Black Police Association has established the Community and \nCultural Resource Unit. It emerged after the Damilola Taylor investigation where black \npolice officers had engaged with local people to assist the case investigation in an area \nmarked by hostility between the police and local black communities. This facilitation had \nresulted in police gaining access to potential witnesses\u2019 houses and learning detailed \ninformation about suspects. The unit operates in critical and major incidents to provide, \nwhere necessary, a \u2018cadre of officers to assist in breaking down some of those barriers of \npotential witnesses and suspects\u2019. For some of those who contributed to the current \nresearch, there was a political imperative and responsibility to use cultural skills in this \nway to directly benefit local black and Asian communities \u2013 what Prevatt Goldstein \n(2002: 772) has referred to as a  \u2018\u2018race\u2019 based service ethic\u2019 in the social work context: \nbecause of my political, cultural beliefs\u2026 I have to give back from \nwhence I took. And I know I have taken from my community so I \n 22\nhave to give something back. \nWhilst some interviewees acknowledged that this was the direction in which they \nwished their professional associations to focus, this aim remained largely aspirational \nbecause of funding constraints. The exception was the Metropolitan Police Service Black \nPolice Association whose pioneering work has also involved a community engagement \nproject which sought to \u201cempower local people, influence and enhance the quality of \nservice received within the North Paddington area\u201d by facilitating positive interactions \nbetween the police and local communities. Additionally, the association has also \nestablished a Youth Leadership Programme which aims to engage local youth on \nparticular policing issues such as gun crime and stop and search, whilst encouraging them \nto advocate for their community. The community programme Revival is a response to \nrising drug- and gun-related crime within black communities (see \nhttp:\/\/www.metbpa.com\/community.htm for details of these community-based \ninitiatives).  \nThe role of facilitating community engagement is one which might be fruitfully filled \nby other black and Asian professional associations. In the case of the National Probation \nService, for example, recent assessments of race equality work indicates that community \nconsultation on the racial impact of policies was an area that local probation services \nwere finding particular difficult in pursuance of their obligations under the Race \nRelations (Amendment) Act 2000 (Wells and Barr 2004). Connecting with local \ncommunities and working in partnership is also a Priority Objective for the service\u2019s \ndiversity strategy, The Heart of the Dance 2003, and one in which the black and Asian \nprofessional associations could be active and make a significant contribution.  \nThese forms of engagement and participation are not without their flaws, however. \nAn assumption is made, for example, that black and Asian professional associations \ncollectively or through individual members are predisposed to take on additional race \n 23\nequality work simply because they form part of a category of employees who have \nexperienced occupational racism. At the level of the professional association, the current \nresearch did indicate such predilections, but it is impossible to say how widely this \nextends to individual black, Asian and other minority ethnic employees working across \nthe criminal justice services (see also Prevatt Goldstein 2002 in the social work context).  \nThe idea of utilizing ethnicity as a resource may also throw up claims of essentialism \nif the underlying premise is that only black and Asian professional associations can \ncontribute to service provision and race equality issues because of some defining cultural \ncharacteristics they possess as a result of their \u2018blackness\u2019 or \u2018Asianess\u2019. Instead here the \nproposal is for black and Asian professional associations to expand and enhance their \nrole because as a collectivity they posses a wealth of expertise which can be used \nalongside to inform the perspectives of other key actors in policy-making and service \ndelivery. Moreover, in the current research, any such essentialising notions were \nconsistently negated by interviewees in the context of thier own day-to-day work. The \ncontribution of cultural perspectives or insight to operational practices, such as providing \nprobation support to an offender or interviewing traditionally hostile witnesses, and to \ncommunity engagement and participation in decision-making on policy and service \ndelivery was viewed as complementary to existing practices, rather than as a more valid \nsubstitute. This is politically significant because it avoids the risk of removing the \n\u2018responsibilizing task\u2019 of eliminating occupational racism, individual or institutional, from \nsenior managers and politicians within the criminal justice services \u2013 a process which \nGarland (2001: 125) argues has happened in relation to crime control11. Moreover, \nframing ethnicity as a resource does not preclude the use of what one interviewee \ndescribed as staff\u2019s \u2018life skills\u2019, thus it is an inclusive complementary conceptualization \nwhich can encompass white ethnicity as a resource too. Given that the vast majority of \nindividuals coming into contact with the criminal justice system are of white ethnicity, \n 24\nthis is hardly controversial.  \nIn the housing context, Tomlins, Johnson and Owen\u2019s (2002) work too recognises the \nconstraints of ethnicity, whereby it can limit housing choice as households select \nparticular areas to live as opposed to others where local residents have historically \ndiscriminated against them. The same potential problem applies to black and Asian staff \nmembers in the criminal justice services if they are perceived to only have skills relating \nto their cultural origin rather than the traditional professional skills in their service areas. \nTheir \u2018ghettoisation\u2019 in race-related areas of expertise, whether by informed choice or \nexternal direction, can have disastrous effects on their careers if they are unable to gain \nother professional skills and competencies in order to progress (see Walker, Spohn and \nDeLone 2004; Cashmore 1991). Prevatt Goldstein\u2019s (2002) research with black social \nworkers indicates that if such work is not valued and rewarded by service managers, it \ncan become burdensome and exploitative, and contribute to heightened stress levels \namong black staff.  This is a potential pitfall which members must individually and \ncollectively guard against, until such a time that cultural knowledge, language skills, and \nother \u2018life skills\u2019  are equally considered to be professional attributes essential to criminal \njustice service delivery.  \nA further constraining factor that will hamper community-focused work relates \nto the funding of black and Asian professional associations. At a time when gaining \ninternal funding for staff associations is becoming increasingly competitive given the  \ngovernment\u2019s commitment to broader equality aims, centred on gender, religion\/faith, \nsexuality and disability, in addition to race, (see Phillips forthcoming), expansion in the \ndirection described in the last part of this paper may not be feasible, however valuable \nsuch work might be. It would likely necessitate new funding arrangements from the \ncriminal justice services or other funding bodies.  \n \n 25\n Conclusion \nIt is difficult to foresee how the black and Asian professional associations studied in this \nresearch will develop in the next decade. Broader strategic alliances with black and Asian \nprofessional associations in other employment sectors, or with professional associations \nrepresenting criminal justice staff on sexuality, disability or faith grounds are both \npossibilities as a means to eliminating discriminatory employment practices12. Given the \nmultitude of shaming expos\u00e8s of racism within the criminal justice services \u2013 the failure \nto prevent the racist murder of an Asian prisoner by his cellmate, the collapse of the \ninappropriate disciplinary case against senior police officer Ali Dizaei, and the BBC \ndocumentary The Secret Policeman which unearthed blatant and extreme racism among \ntrainee constables \u2013 it seems probable that race equality will remain on the political \nagenda for some time to come, and thus the role of black and Asian professional \nassociations may be assured. This paper has highlighted the significance of the internal \nfunctions of such organizations in assisting members to resist racism and marginalization \nin the criminal justice services. Despite the reform agenda post-Macpherson, \nemployment for some staff is still marked by subtle discrimination in the workplace. \nTherefore it seems likely that support, advocacy and networking will continue to be core \nactivities for the black and Asian professional associations. This paper has tentatively \nproposed the further development of the external focus of professional associations to \nimprove service delivery to minority ethnic users, arguing that they present an under-\nutilised resource for criminal justice services in pursuing race equality and eliminating \ninstitutional racism. It remains to be seen whether such work can be established, given \nthe rather insecure nature of their internal funding and any political opposition which \nmay arise if proposals are made to expand their work.  \n \n 26\nReferences \n \nAlfred, R.

I am grateful to Ben Bowling for his comments on an earlier draft of this paper, and to the \ntwo anonymous referees. \n1 This assumes that minority ethnic officers do not act in the same way as their white colleagues in \nnegatively stereotyping members of the public from their own ethnic groups, an assumption which is not \nnecessarily supported by empirical evidence (see for example Walker, Spone and DeLone (2004), Bowling \nand Phillips 2002, and see Bowling et al. (2005) for a discussion of the role of ethnic minority practitioners \nin the criminal justice process). \n2 For a full discussion of the issues surrounding the naming and membership criteria of these organisations \nsee Phillips (forthcoming). \n3 These include police suspects and victims, defendants, probation clients, and prisoners, etc. \n4 A former Chairperson was also interviewed. \n5 Despite repeated attempts, access was not gained to interview Chairpersons of the Association of Muslim \nLawyers, the Association of Asian Lawyers, or the Society of Black Lawyers. \n6 This professional association was selected as one of the longest established and because of its focus on \n 29\n                                                                                                                                            \nboth supporting black probation officers and promoting the anti-discriminatory delivery of services to \nprobation clients. \n7 There was also some documentary analysis of ABPO materials (e.g. constitution, minutes of meetings, \nAGM papers, business plans, etc.). \n8 One interviewee who had worked more closely with the relevant mainstream union was more positive \nabout their contribution to race equality work. \n9 This commitment has been espoused by government politicians on numerous occasions \u2013 Tony Blair has \nhimself talked of New Labour achieving \u201ctrue equality: equal worth, an equal chance of fulfilment, equal \naccess to knowledge and opportunity\u201d, and \u201cnot equality of income or outcome\u201d (see for example his 1999 \nLabour Party Conference Speech).    \n10 The Metropolitan Police Service\u2019s Black Police Association appeared as witnesses to the MPA Scrutiny \non Stop and Search with similar consultations undertaken in Avon and Somerset, for example. A more \nformal role as Panel members is envisaged here. \n11 As yet, the state has not abrogated sovereign responsibility for race equality, although there are some \ncommon elements in the way in which it has sought to responsibilize private and non-state actors to assist \nwith this \u2018troubelsome function\u2019 (Garland 2001: 127). \n12 At the Association of Black Probation Officers AGM in 2004, one of the workshops asked delegates to \nconsider whether there should be one staff association representing black probation staff and prison staff, \ngiven the establishment of NOMS, or indeed one for all those working within the criminal justice services. \nIn March 2005, the National Coalition of Black-Led Organisations (NCBLO) was launched with \nrepresentatives from many government departments and some private companies. \n 30\n"}
