After a baseline \nperiod of four lessons, the teachers attended an informational session on adaptive student \nmotivation and how to support it. The training program also included individualized guidance \nduring the last four lessons of the cycle. Results revealed that from pre- to post-intervention: \n(1) teachers managed to improve their teaching style in terms of all three dimensions, and (2) \nstudents were receptive to these changes, as shown by increases in their reported need \nsatisfaction, self-determined motivation and engagement in the class.  \n \n \nKey words: Self-determination theory needs support, teaching behaviors, motivational \nclimate, physical education, motivation, engagement. \n  \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n3 \n \nThe Effect of an Intervention to Improve Newly Qualified Teachers\u2019 Interpersonal Style, \nStudents Motivation and Psychological Need Satisfaction in Sport-Based Physical Education  \n \nA considerable amount of research in the last two decades has examined the \nimplications of being intrinsically or extrinsically motivated in school settings (see Ryan & \nDeci, 2000; Reeve, Deci, & Ryan, 2004, for reviews). Nevertheless, much of what we know \nabout motivation in school environments comes from survey data. Several scholars (e.g., \nPatrick, Anderman, Ryan, Edelin, & Midgley, 2001; Urdan & Turner, 2005) have underlined \nthe necessity to carry out studies that enable the examination of possible causal links in order \nto improve our understanding of the relationship between instructional practices and student \nmotivation. To this effect, and based on self-determination theory (SDT; e.g., Deci & Ryan, \n2002), the aim of this study was to test the effects of a multidimensional motivation-based \ntraining program for physical education teachers on their teaching behaviors and their \nstudents\u2019 motivation and psychological need satisfaction. \n \nSelf-Determination Theory \n Over the last 20 years, SDT has been established as a heuristic theoretical framework to \nstudy individuals\u2019 motivated behaviors in several life contexts, including school settings (see \nDeci, Vallerand, Pelletier, & Ryan, 1991; Reeve, 2002; Reeve et al., 2004; Ryan & Deci, \n2000, for reviews). According to SDT, the central concept that could explain the relationship \nbetween students\u2019 motivation and their experiences in the classroom is the degree to which \ntheir behaviors are autonomous (i.e., fully volitional, freely pursued, and wholly endorsed by \nthe self) as opposed to controlled (i.e., pursued and directed by external or internal forces \nleaving students feeling like they have very little or no choice). Research clearly supports the \nidea that individuals have different types of motivation, ranging from high (autonomous) to \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n4 \n \nlow (controlled) levels of self-determination. Students can be intrinsically motivated (when \nthey engage in learning activities for their inherent appeal), extrinsically motivated (when \nthey engage in activities for instrumental reasons), or amotivated (when they have no \nmotivation toward an activity).  \n Intrinsic motivation represents the prototype of self-determination, because a person is \nmotivated to act for the fun or challenge entailed in the behavior rather than because of \nexternal contingencies, such as pressures or rewards. In contrast extrinsic motivation \nembraces a variety of behavioral regulations that vary in their relative degree of self-\ndetermination. In an increasing degree of self-determination these regulations are: external \n(partaking in an activity because of external pressures or incentives, such as rewards, threats \nor punishment), introjected (doing an activity because of internal pressures such as guilt or \nshame), identified (pursuing an activity because one finds it important and useful) and \nintegrated1 (undertaking an activity because it is congruent with one\u2019s set of core goals and \nvalues).. Finally, SDT also proposes amotivation which refers to the absence of both intrinsic \nand extrinsic motivation and represents a complete lack of self-determination and volition \nwith respect to the target behavior (Deci & Ryan, 2000). Amotivation stems from lack \ncompetence, the belief that an activity is unimportant, and\/or when an individual does not \nperceive contingencies between her\/his behavior and desired outcome(s) (Ryan & Deci, 2000; \nVallerand, 1997). In sum, intrinsic, integrated, and indentified regulations are self-determined, \nwhereas amotivation, external and introjected regulations are non self-determined forms of \nmotivation.  \nSDT-based research has shown that higher levels of self-determined motivation are \nrelated to several positive outcomes, such as student effort, academic achievement, \nengagement, quality of conceptual learning, preference for optimal challenge, creativity, and \nrates of retention (see Reeve, 2002; Ryan & Deci, 2000, for reviews). Among these outcomes, \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n5 \n \nstudent engagement is critical for academic learning (Turner, Meyer, Cox, Logan, DiCintio, & \nThomas, 1998) and a useful concept to study from a SDT perspective in educational settings \n(Reeve, 2002). Referring to the behavioral intensity and emotional quality of a person\u2019s active \ninvolvement during a task (Connell, 1990; Reeve, Jang, et al., 2004; Connell & Wellborn, \n1991), engagement provides teachers with an observable manifestation of the quality of a \nstudent\u2019s motivation (Reeve, 2002). In physical education more specifically, engagement \ncovers cognitive (i.e., students\u2019 degree of investment in learning and self-regulation), affective \n(i.e., students could be enthusiastic, half-hearted, or experience negative emotions such as \nboredom), and behavioral (i.e., students could be active versus passive during the lessons) \naspects. Thus, engagement provides teachers with information they can more or less readily \nobserve and monitor. Therefore, in the present study we utilized engagement as a manifest \nindicator of students\u2019 motivation, to complement student self-reports of their motivational \nregulations.   \n \nDeterminants of Motivation and Engagement \nAccording to Cognitive Evaluation Theory (CET; Deci & Ryan, 1985), a sub-theory \nwithin SDT that specifies factors that explain variability in intrinsic motivation, social-\ncontextual events that foster feelings of competence and autonomy can enhance intrinsic \nmotivation. A theoretical proposition of SDT (Deci & Ryan, 2002) is that socials factors \u2013 \nsuch as teachers\u2019 interpersonal style \u2013 can influence students\u2019 motivation and engagement by \nnurturing versus thwarting three basic psychological needs. These are the needs for autonomy \n(i.e., feeling the \u2018origin\u2019 as opposed to the \u2018pawn\u2019 of their actions), competence (i.e., feeling \neffective in their school-related interactions), and relatedness (i.e., feeling secured and \nmeaningfully connected to others). Previous studies have conceptualized interpersonal style \nalong a continuum that ranges from highly controlling to highly autonomy-supportive \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n6 \n \nbehaviors (e.g., Deci, Schwartz, Sheinman, & Ryan, 1981; see Reeve 2002 for a review). \nHowever, recent studies (e.g., Reeve, et al., 2004; Skinner & Belmont, 1993; Skinner & Edge, \n2002) have expanded upon this unidimensional continuum by examining characteristics of the \nenvironment which satisfy or thwart each of the three psychological needs. In this line of \nwork, researchers have labeled as \u201cautonomy support\u201d, \u201cstructure\u201d and \u201cinterpersonal \ninvolvement\u201d, the socials factors likely to nourish the needs for autonomy, competence and \nrelatedness, respectively.  \nAutonomy support refers to behaviors by a person in position of authority that show \nrespect, allow freedom of expression and action, and encourage subordinates to attend to, \naccept, and value their inner states, preferences, and desires (Deci & Ryan, 1987). Examples \nof autonomy supportive behaviors are the provision of choice and meaningful rationale from \nteachers, the support of student volition and the acknowledgment of the students\u2019 perspective \n(Deci, Eghrari, Patrick, & Leone, 1994). The opposite of autonomy support is coercion. When \nteachers are coercive, pressuring, or controlling (e.g., by ushering commands and deadlines), \nthen students\u2019 need for autonomy is threaten because they tend to experience themselves as \n\u201cpawns\u201d in the hands of teachers (Skinner & Edge, 2002).  \nStructure describes the extent to which a social context is structured, predictable, \ncontingent, and consistent (Skinner & Edge, 2002). More specifically, when a teacher \nprovides challenging tasks, negotiates clear and short-term goals, delivers contingent \nfeedback related to students\u2019 endeavors, and encourages their effort and progress, he\/she tends \nto nurture the students\u2019 need for competence and their self-determined motivation. This is \nespecially the case if the components of structure are delivered in an autonomy supportive \nmanner (Deci & Ryan, 1991). The opposite of structure is chaos. When contexts are \nnoncontingent, uncontrollable, or chaotic, students will come to experience themselves as \nincompetent (Skinner & Edge, 2002).  \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n7 \n \nFinally, interpersonal involvement refers to individuals\u2019 opportunities to feel related \nand belonging when they interact within a social environment that offers affection, warmth, \ncare, and nurturance (Skinner & Edge, 2002). In school, when teachers are sympathetic, warm \nand affectionate with their students, when they dedicate psychological resources, such as time, \nenergy and affection (Deci & Ryan, 1991; Reeve et al., 2004), they tend to nurture their \nstudents\u2019 relatedness and self-determined motivation. The opposite of interpersonal \ninvolvement is hostility. When teachers are hostile or neglectful, students experience \nthemselves as unlovable and the context as untrustworthy (Skinner & Edge, 2002). \nAutonomy support, structure and interpersonal involvement are independent but \ncomplementary dimensions of a teacher\u2019s interpersonal style. Student motivation thrives \nunder condition in which teachers find ways to provide optimal structure and high autonomy \nsupport (Skinner & Belmont, 1993), because structure facilitates students\u2019 intentions to act, \nwhile autonomy support allows those formulated intentions to be self-determined and aligned \nwith their inner resources (Reeve et al., 2004). As far as interpersonal involvement is \nconcerned, Skinner and Edge (2002) advance the idea that a high level of interpersonal \ninvolvement is needed to provide optimal structure and to support students\u2019 autonomy.  \n Past studies have consistently shown the benefits of an autonomy-supportive teacher \nstyle on students\u2019 motivation, emotion, learning, and performance (see Deci & Ryan, 1987; \nDeci et al., 1991; Reeve, 2002, for reviews). However, many teachers tend to use controlling \nstrategies (Newby, 1991), and physical education teachers are not the exception (Sarrazin, \nTessier, Pelletier, Trouilloud, & Chanal, 2006; Taylor, Ntoumanis, & Smith, 2009). Empirical \nevidence in the school environment, and in particular in physical education classes, regarding \nstructure and involvement is relatively scarce (for an exception, see Taylor & Ntoumanis, \n2007). Thus, from an applied perspective, an important question to ask is whether it is \npossible to help teachers improve their existing teaching style to be more need-supportive and \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n8 \n \nless need-thwarting. \nCan Teachers Modify Their Interpersonal Style to be More Need-Supportive?  \nFour studies, to our knowledge, have examined the question of whether it is possible \nto educate teachers to develop a more need-supportive interpersonal style (Chatzisarantis & \nHagger, 2009; Reeve, 1998; Reeve, Jang, Carrell, Jeon, & Barch, 2004; Tessier, Sarrazin, & \nNtoumanis, 2008). Reeve\u2019s (1998) study involved 114 females and 45 males pre-service \nteachers. The educational program entailed reading an instructional booklet for 45 min \npresenting one of three teaching styles: autonomy supportive, controlling, or neutral. \nCompared to those who read an instructional booklet on a controlling or neutral teaching \nstyle, pre-service teachers who read the autonomy supportive strategies booklet reported an \nincrease in their autonomous orientation. However, a limitation of the study was that the \nteachers\u2019 actual behaviors were not assessed. A self-reported interpersonal style may not \nnecessarily be manifested during classroom instruction. \nThis limitation was addressed by Reeve, Jang, et al. (2004). Involving 20 experienced \nteachers (i.e., 9 women and 11 men teaching mathematics, economics, English and science), \nthe authors developed an informational session on how teachers can be autonomy supportive \ntoward students. Teachers\u2019 behaviors were subsequently coded by two trained raters over a \nseries of three classroom observations. Results showed that teachers increased their use of \nautonomy-supportive behaviors compared to their baseline levels. Further, students\u2019 \nengagement (i.e., their active task involvement during instruction, and initiative in taking \npersonal responsibility for their learning) was positively affected by increases in teachers\u2019 \nautonomy support. Nevertheless, the intervention did not attempt to increase the use of \nstructure and interpersonal involvement by teachers and did not assess students\u2019 reports of \ntheir own motivation.  \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n9 \n \nThe Tessier et al. (2008) study involved five physical education teachers (i.e., 3 males \nand 2 females) randomly assigned to a control or an autonomy-supportive training group over \nan 8-week teaching cycle. To assess the effect of the teacher training, teacher-student \ninteractions were videotaped and coded via an observational grid developed by Sarrazin et al. \n(2006), which distinguished between different categories of teacher communications. Results \nshowed that compared to the teachers in the control group, those in the experimental group \nused an autonomy supportive style with greater frequency. Nevertheless, this study had two \nlimitations. First, although the two groups were matched in terms of important characteristics \n(i.e., teaching experience, student socio-economic status and motivation), the teachers\u2019 \ninterpersonal style was not assessed prior to the teacher training. It is thus difficult to know if \nthe observed post-training differences were related to the training itself or if they pre-existed. \nSecondly, the effects of the teacher training on students\u2019 engagement and motivation were not \nassessed. Thus, it is not possible to know if the students were receptive to the modifications of \ntheir teachers\u2019 style. \n Involving 10 physical education teachers and 215 pupils, Chatzisarantis and Hagger \n(2009) developed a 10-week intervention program and examined its effects on students\u2019 \nphysical activity intentions and self-reported leisure-time activity behavior. The study \nemployed two conditions, an autonomy supportive one in which teachers were trained to \nprovide rationale, feedback, choice and acknowledge difficulties, and a less autonomy-\nsupportive one in which teachers provided rationale and feedback only. Results indicated that \nstudents who were taught by more autonomy supportive teachers reported stronger intentions \nto exercise during leisure time and participated more frequently in leisure-time physical \nactivities than students taught by less autonomy supportive teachers. This is the first study that \ndemonstrates the usefulness of SDT for the development of school-based interventions to \nincrease physical activity participation. Nevertheless, more studies are needed to test the \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n10 \n \neffectiveness of others teachers\u2019 behaviors related to structure and interpersonal involvement, \nin addition to autonomy support. Further, it should be noted that Chatzisarantis and Hagger \n(2009) did not have a control condition with any autonomy support provided, and did not \nmeasure student motivation. \n Aims and Hypotheses \nIn sum, although initial evidence has emerged indicating that teachers can learn to \nbetter support students\u2019 psychological needs, further research is needed to address limitations \nin previous studies. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to test the effects of a \nmultidimensional teacher training program, on overt behaviors of newly qualified teachers, \nstudents\u2019 self-reported need satisfaction, self-determined motivation and engagement in class. \nWe hypothesized that the training program will increase teachers\u2019 provision of autonomy \nsupport, structure and involvement. Secondly, we hypothesized that students will be sensitive \nto the changes in their teachers\u2019 intrapersonal style by reporting greater satisfaction of all \nthree psychological needs, more self-determined motivation and greater engagement in \nlearning tasks.  \n \nMethod \nParticipants  \nThree physical education teachers (1 male and 2 females, ranging in age from 24 to 28 \nyears) and their 185 students (102 females and 83 males from 9th to 11th grade; M age = 16.56 \nyears, SD =1.38, age range = 14 - 18 years) from six classes of three senior high schools \nsituated in the Northeast of France volunteered to participate in the study. Most of the \nstudents in this sample were of upper-middle socio-economic status. The ethnic distribution of \nthe sample was as follows: 74% white (n=137), 14% North African (n=26), 3% from another \nEuropean country (n=5). Nine percent (n=17) did not report their ethnicity. All three teachers \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n11 \n \nwere in their first year of teaching. Teacher 1 was a 24 years-old woman who taught \nbadminton in classes 1 (student n = 30; 16 female n = 16; from 9th grade) and table tennis in \nclass 2 (student n = 31; female n = 17; from 11th grade). Teacher 2 was a 28 years-old man \nwho taught softball in classes 3 (student n = 27; female n = 16; from 11th grade) and basket-\nball in class 4 (student n = 34; female n = 19; from 11th grade). Teacher 3 was a 26 years-old \nwoman who taught badminton in classes 5 (student n = 30; female n = 16; from 11th grade) \nand table tennis in class 6 (student n = 33; female n = 18; from 11th grade).  \nWe choose to work with newly qualified teachers because: (1) they have only 10 hours \nof teaching a week, and thus have some time to reflect on their teaching, and (2) they possess \na relatively malleable interpersonal style, and therefore are often interested in new teaching \nstrategies as they have not established yet strong teaching habits (Hoy & Woolfolk, 1990).  \nOur sample choice was constrained by: (a) timetabling (we had to ensure that we were able to \nfilm all the teachers each week), and (b) the activity taught (some activities took place in big \nopen spaces \u2013 such as soccer, track and field \u2013 and thus were not conducive to video \nobservation). These constrains determined the selection of the three teachers who participated \nto the study, among all those who volunteered. We chose to study students from senior high \nschools because adolescents who are 15 years or older often reduce their physical activity \ninvolvement (Lubans, Foster, & Biddle, 2008). In fact, physical education teachers often \nreport a decrease in student engagement in the lesson, an increase in medical certificates that \nexempt students from the lessons, and a decline in physical activity undertaken out of school. \nInformed consent was obtained from the Head Teachers of the schools, the teachers and the \nstudents\u2019 parents. \n \nProcedure \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n12 \n \nIn France, physical education is a compulsory subject for all high school students \nwhose grade for the subject depends on their skillfulness and sport performance. Students \nattend physical education lessons once a week for 2 hours. A physical education lesson is \ngenerally structured along 3 different parts \u2013 warm-up, learning, and formative assessment. \nThese three parts are of different nature and involve different kind of teacher and student \nbehaviors. We chose to focus our study on the middle part (representing about 50 minutes to \n1h10), which is the longest and the one in which the most interactions about learning occur \nbetween the teacher and the students. Generally, the physical education curriculum comprises \nof 8-week sport units. The first and the eighth lessons, reserved for the initial and final \nassessments of students\u2019 motor skills, were not taken into account. Teachers\u2019 overt behaviors \nand students\u2019 engagement were videotaped during the remaining 6 physical education \nsessions using a digital camcorder. The camcorder had a large viewing angle which enabled \nthe recording of all students and the physical education teacher simultaneously. All classes \nwere filmed at least one lesson before the beginning of the data collection in order to reduce \nreactivity effects associated with the use of the camcorder.  \nThe experimental procedure used in this study comprised of three parts. In the first \npart (i.e., lessons 2 - 4), the usual teaching behaviors and student engagement were videotaped \nat each lesson. At the end of lesson 2, students answered a questionnaire in order to assess \ntheir initial levels of psychological need satisfaction and self-determined motivation in the \nactivity practiced. At this first part of the study, no reference was made to the teachers about \ntheir interpersonal style. Rather, they were told that the researchers were only interested in \ndifferent types of student behavior exhibited during physical education courses. This was a \nprecautionary measure taken to prevent a Hawthorne effect2 (e.g., Adair, Sharpe, & Huynh, \n1989).  \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n13 \n \nIn the second part of the experiment, between the 4th and the 5th lessons, the teachers \nwere invited at the university to attend a half-day (i.e., about 4 hours) informational session. \nThis session began with a 1-hour presentation of the basic tenets of SDT, including the \ndifferent types of student motivation, the different teacher interpersonal styles (i.e., need-\nthwarting vs. needs-supportive), and their effects on students. Further, empirical evidence was \npresented \u2013 for about one hour \u2013 to support the argument that students benefit when teachers \nsupport students\u2019 needs. Examples of a need-supportive teacher (e.g., offering choice and \ninitiative taking, ensuring optimal challenge and learner-centered feedback, investing time \nand effort towards students) were specifically emphasized using video footage of other \nphysical education teachers. The two major aims of the training workshop were: (1) to explain \nto teachers that using a reward-punishment system can be seriously detrimental to student \nmotivation, and (2) to help teachers build their lessons by answering the question: How can I \nprovide the conditions under which students can motivates themselves? Finally, during the \nlast two hours of the session, teachers were invited to analyze their own interpersonal style \nbased on video footage recorded during the first part of the study, and to plan the last lessons \nof the cycle (i.e., lessons 5-7) in a more need-supportive manner. This work aimed to discuss \nalterations in the planning of lessons by the teachers to provide more opportunities for need \nsatisfaction (e.g., \u201cin basketball, if I show two possible ways to shoot, and I propose to the \nstudents to try ten times each position and then choose which one is best for them, do you \nthink I am being need-supportive?\u201d).  \nFinally, in the third part of the cycle (i.e., lessons 5-7), teacher and student behaviors \nwere again videotaped in each lesson. Using this video footage, an individualized guidance \nprogram for each teacher was developed. Specifically, after each lesson the experimenter and \nthe teacher analyzed, for 15 to 30 minutes, the teacher\u2019s interpersonal style in order to help \nthe teacher improve his\/her capacity to motivate students. More specifically, this debriefing \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n14 \n \nsession aimed to find alternatives to reduce the frequency of directive commands, emphasized \nthe transmission of technical feedback using non-controlling language, helped teachers to \nbetter understand the students\u2019 point of view, and emphasized the importance of downplaying \nsocial comparison. When the teachers did not manage to find alternatives by themselves, the \nexperimenter offered some suggestions. In some cases, when a teacher thought that a need \nsupportive interpersonal style was not the best option (e.g., when reminding students about \nsafety rules or restoring discipline in the classroom), the experimenter did not try to impose a \nnew strategy. At the 7th lesson, students responded to a questionnaire assessing again their \nlevels of need satisfaction and motivational regulations.  \n \nMeasures \nStudents\u2019 self-determined motivation in physical education. Motivation toward the \nsport practiced in the teaching cycle (i.e., softball, table tennis, badminton and basketball) was \nassessed in the 2nd and the 7th lesson with the Echelle de Motivation pour l\u2019Education \nPhysique (EMEP; Physical Education Motivation Scale, Sarrazin, Tessier, Chanal, Boich\u00e9, \nChalabaev, & Trouilloud, 2007). Based on the Sport Motivation Scale (Pelletier, Fortier, \nVallerand, Tuson, Bri\u00e8re, & Blais, 1995) and the Academic Motivation Scale (Vallerand, \nPelletier, Blais, Bri\u00e8re, Sen\u00e9cal, & Valli\u00e8res, 1992), EMEP was constructed in order to reflect \nboth the sporting and educational aspects of physical education. The adaptation consisted of \nminor changes in the wording of some items to target the physical education context. is the \nscale comprises of 26 items and assesses the multifaceted motivational regulations proposed \nby SDT. The participants read the stem \u201cI participate in this teaching cycle because...\u201d, and \nresponded to items reflecting intrinsic motivation (IM) toward knowledge (IMK; e.g., \u201cfor the \nfun of discovering new skills\/techniques\u201d), IM toward accomplishment (IMA; e.g., \u201c... for the \nsatisfaction I experience while I am perfecting my abilities\u201d), IM to experience stimulation \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n15 \n \n(IMS; e.g., \u201c... for the excitement I feel when I am really involved in the activity\u201d), identified \nregulation (IDR; e.g., \u201c... because what I learn in physical education will be useful later\u201d), \nintrojected regulation (INR; e.g., \u201c... because I must do this teaching cycle to feel good about \nmyself\u201d), external regulation (EXR; e.g., \u201c... because I will be assessed\u201d), and amotivation \n(AM; e.g., \u201cI don\u2019t know why I participate, if I could, I would get exempted\u201d). Responses \nwere made on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). \nPrevious studies have offered support concerning the factorial validity (e.g., Boich\u00e9 et al., \n2008; Sarrazin et al., 2007), predictive validity (e.g., Boich\u00e9 et al., 2008; Chalabaev et al., \n2009) and reliability of the EMEP (e.g., Boich\u00e9 et al., 2008; Chalabaev et al., 2009; Sarrazin \net al., 2006; Tessier et al., 2008). In this study, all subscales had adequate Cronbach alphas \npre- and post-training (IMS pre\/post: .88\/.86; IMA pre\/post: .82\/.85; IMK pre\/post: .80\/.77; \nIDR pre\/post: .80\/.89; INR pre\/post: .74\/.80; EXR pre\/post: .73\/.78; AM pre\/post: .92\/.90). \nThus the average of the items on each subscale was used for our analysis. \nPsychological need satisfaction. The needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness were \nassessed in the 2nd and 7th lessons of the cycle with an adapted version for physical \neducation of the Basic Psychological Needs Scale (BNSC; Deci, Ryan, Gagn\u00e9, Leone, \nUsunov, & Kornazheva, 2001). This is a 21-item questionnaire that taps perception of \ncompetence (6 items; e.g., \u201cI have been able to learn interesting new skills in physical \neducation\u201d), relatedness (8 items; e.g., \u201cI feel like my physical education teacher listen to \nme\u201d3), and autonomy need satisfaction (7 items; e.g., \u201cI feel like I can make a lot of inputs to \ndeciding what to do in physical education\u201d). All items were measured on 7-points scales (1 = \nnot at all true; 7 = very true). Ntoumanis (2005) has provided evidence for the validity and \nreliability of the English version of this scale. The items were translated into French following \nthe standard translation and back-translation process recommended by Brislin (1970). In our \nstudy, each sub-scale possessed adequate Cronbach alphas (i.e., competence pre\/post: .84\/.83; \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n16 \n \nautonomy pre\/post: .69\/.70; relatedness pre\/post: .87\/.84). \nOvert teacher and student behaviors. Each class was videotaped during the six \ntargeted lessons. The teachers\u2019 interpersonal style and the students\u2019 collective (i.e., class) \nengagement were coded with an adapted version for physical education (see Figure 1) of an \nobservation rating scale developed by Reeve, Jang, et al. (2004). Our observation grid also \nincluded additional behaviors selected after an extensive review of the extant literature (Deci \n& Ryan, 1991, Deci et al., 1994; Reeve, 1996, 1998; Reeve et al., 2004; Reeve & Jang, 2006). \nIn order to better capture teachers\u2019 interactions within a class, we coded separately the \ncommunications addressed to the whole class and those aimed to a single student. The \ndimension autonomy-support appears in the upper left quadrant and contains four items: \norganizational instructions given to the whole class, rationale about learning tasks given to the \nwhole class, teacher\u2019s guidance given to a single student and rationale about learning tasks \ngiven to a single student. The dimension structure appears in the upper right quadrant and \ncontains three items: structure of the learning tasks for the whole class, structure of individual \nstudent activity, and student encouragement. The dimension interpersonal involvement \nappears in the lower left quadrant and contains two items: instructions given to the whole \nclass and interactions with students. Each of the items was anchored by bipolar descriptors \nsituated on a 7-point scale ranging from (1) \u201cbehaviors that thwart needs satisfaction\u201d to (7) \n\u201cbehaviors that nurture the basic psychological needs\u201d.  \nFinally, students\u2019 collective engagement appears in the lower right quadrant and \ncontains three items: cognitive, affective and behavioral engagement. The cognitive \nengagement refers to the levels of psychological investment in learning and self-regulation. \nThe affective engagement refers to the degree of enthusiasm in the lesson. Lastly, the \nbehavioral engagement refers to the level of intensity of effort and persistence in learning \nmanifested by students 4. Following earlier studies (e.g., Reeve, Jang, et al., 2004), we \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n17 \n \ncombined the three ratings into one overall engagement score (\u03b1 = .76 and .72 for the pre-test \nand post-test periods, respectively) capturing students\u2019 collective engagement.\u00a0\n Each teacher behavior and student engagement item was rated on a continuum \nranging from 1 (i.e., teacher behavior thwarts needs satisfaction\/ high levels of student \ndisaffection) to 7 (i.e., teacher behavior nurtures the basic psychological needs\/high levels of \nstudent engagement). For the coercion versus autonomy support dimension, number 1 refers \nto controlling communications such as using commands and directives, imposing rules and \nlimits or delivering controlling feedback (e.g., \u201cextend your arm after the shot, I have told you \nthat 10 times!\u201d). In contrast, number 7 refers to autonomy supportive communications such as \ngiving choices and options, explaining rules and limits or delivering feedback in an \ninformational way (e.g., \u201cmaybe you could try different kinds of shoots and then choose the \nbest\u201d). For the chaos versus structure dimension, number 1 refers to vague goals, no feedback \nneither encouragement, and to a learning system which is uniform for all students, whereas \nnumber 7 refers to teachers\u2019 behaviors which create a context (i.e., tasks, goals, feedback, and \nencouragement) that encourages students to take responsibilities, and to take ownership of \ntheir own learning. For the hostility versus interpersonal involvement dimension, number 7 \nrefers to a teacher who is warm, sympathetic, humorous, listening and investing time and \nenergy for students. In contrast, number 1 refers to a teacher who is cold, distant, sarcastic, \nand inflexible with students. \nWith regard to the students\u2019 collective engagement, number 1 on the cognitive \nengagement scale refers to students who ignore their teacher\u2019s instructions (e.g., they chat) \nand who do not produce the expected work. In contrast, number 7 refers to students who are \ninvested in understanding their actions (e.g., they solicit attention from the teacher; they ask \nhim\/her questions when they do not understand instructions). For affective engagement, \nnumber 1 refers to students who are disinterested, bored, and lethargic, whereas number 7 \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n18 \n \nrefers to students who are joyful, interested, energetic, full of fun whatever they are asked to \nplay or learn. As for behavioral engagement, being partly a function of the physical activity \npracticed, we assessed intensity of effort and perseverance for each physical activity. For \ninstance in basket-ball, number 1 refers to students who walk on the play ground, get rid of \nthe ball, do not shake off the marker, do not defend. In contrast, number 7 refers to students \nwho put a lot of effort in playing both offensive and defensive roles5. \nCoding reliability  \nFour researchers, specialists in both the psychology of education and SDT, coded the \n36 lessons recorded for the study. To prevent rating artifacts, such as inadvertently inflating \nthe association between teachers\u2019 behaviors and students\u2019 engagement, two raters coded the \nteachers\u2019 interpersonal style and two others coded students\u2019 engagement. Also, we \nrandomized the order of viewing so that no coders knew from which period (pre-test or post-\ntest) the video footage came from. Only the central part of the lesson devoted to learning was \nvideotaped. \nBefore the first coding, a two-hour meeting was organized to explain the grid to the \nraters and how to assign a number to an observed behavior. Coding took place in twelve \nmeetings lasting 3 hours each (i.e., 36 hours). The raters of teachers\u2019 behaviors were \ninstructed that the scores on the different teaching dimensions should reflect behaviors most \nfrequently used by the teacher (i.e., his\/her dominant teaching profile) during the lesson. The \nraters of students\u2019 collective engagement were told to consider both the percentage of students \nenacting each behavior, and the intensity of students\u2019 expressions of these behaviors. So a \nhigh score on an engagement indicator indicates that most or almost all of the students \nexpressed the behavior and to a high level of intensity. The video footages were watched \nwithout interruption; the raters were free to fill in the grid whenever they wanted and to \nmodify their assessments when and if necessary.     \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n19 \n \nFollowing Bakeman and Gottman (1997) recommendations, the inter- and intra-rater \nreliabilities were estimated using the Cohen\u2019s kappa coefficients. The inter-rater reliability \nwas estimated on the basis of the 36 lessons of the study, whereas the intra-rater reliability \nwas estimated from 5 lessons randomly selected. The coders rated again this sample of 5 \nlessons two weeks later. The analysis revealed good inter- and intra-rater reliabilities \npertaining to the three intrapersonal teaching style variables (between .72 to .91; Mintra = .84; \nMinter = .80) and that of student engagement (between .74 to .95; Mintra = .86; Minter = .81). As \nthe inter-rater reliability was satisfactory, we averaged the scores for each pair of raters into \none overall score for each variable per lesson.  \nData analysis  \n Given that the sample size of teachers (n = 3) is extremely small for any type of \nstatistical analysis (parametric or non parametric test), we employed methodology used in \nsingle-subject designs studies (e.g., Hanton & Jones, 1999; Shambrook, Bull & Douglas, \n1994; Swain & Jones, 1995) to test our first hypothesis concerning the effects of the training \non the teachers\u2019 interpersonal style. Specifically, we plotted on a graph the data points related \nto teachers\u2019 behaviors before and after the experimental intervention. To do so, we averaged \nthe pre-training data (from lessons 2 to 4) and the post-training data (from lessons 5 to 7). In \nbrief, nine graphs were created presenting changes from before to after the intervention, for \neach of the nine teachers\u2019 behaviors (i.e., organizational instructions, rationale given to the \nwhole class, teacher\u2019s guidance, rationale give, to a single student, structure of the learning \ntasks, structure of the students\u2019 activity, encouragement and praise, instructions given to the \nwhole class and interaction with students) observed in the six classes. The steepness of the \nslope of the line joining the data points indicates the extent of the impact of the change of the \nvariable under examination. Despite the subjective nature of visual inspection, there are \navailable criteria and guidelines (e.g., Horner et al., 2005) when examining the impact of such \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n20 \n \ntreatment effects. The main issue is to decide what the threshold is for inferring that any \nobserved changes are not a reflection of intra-teacher variability but the effect of the \nexperimental intervention. Following suggestions by Horner et al. for visual analysis in \nsingle-subject designs, we considered that a change over 0.7 of a unit could be used as such a \nthreshold. This is because 0.7 represents 10% of the range of the scale, which seems a high \ndegree of change given that the pre-test and the post-test values are averages of three lessons, \nand such averages tend to reduce the effect of the intra-teacher variability. Further, we also \ntook into account the scale midpoint (i.e., 4) as the threshold distinguishing teacher\u2019s \nbehaviors being more need-supportive than need-threatening (see Figure 1).    \nTo test the effects of teacher training on students\u2019 collective (i.e., class) engagement, \nwe also plotted the data on a graph. To test the effects of the teacher training on individual \nstudents\u2019 motivational regulations and psychological need satisfaction, we performed repeated \nmeasures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVAs), as at the individual student level the \nsample size was adequate (n = 185).  \n \nResults \nDid Teachers\u2019 Interpersonal Style Change? \nAutonomy support  \nFigure 2 illustrates the changes in teachers\u2019 autonomy supportive behaviors, separately \nfor each class. Concerning the organizational instruction given to the whole class, Figure 2a \nshows an increase of this behavior after the teachers\u2019 training only for classes 1 (C1) and 2 \n(C2) (i.e., from 2 to 5.75 and from 3.22 to 5.67 for C1 and C2, respectively). These two \nclasses were taught by the same teacher (i.e., teacher 1). The scores for classes C3, C4, C5 \nand C6 remained stable, changing at maximum 0.7 units. Inspection of the post-training \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n21 \n \nscores shows that scores for 3 classes were above the midpoint of the scale (i.e., 4), indicating \nmore choices and options were given than commands and impositions (see the rating scale in \nFigure 1). \nConcerning the use of rationale given to the whole class, Figure 2b shows an \nappreciable increase for teacher 1 (i.e., from 3 to 5.5 for C1 and from 4 to 6 for C2) and for \nteacher 3 (i.e., from 4.5 to 6 for C5 and from 2.33 to 5.5 for C6), and a stable trend for teacher \n2 (i.e., from 2.83 to 2.5 for C3 and from 3.56 to 3.25 for C4). As a result, scores for 4 of the 6 \nclasses were above the scale midpoint, indicating that teachers from these classes used more \nrational than imposing rules and limits (see rating scale in Figure 1). \nConcerning teacher guidance, Figure 2c shows a considerable and uniform increase \n(about 2.5 units on average in the six classes) after the teachers\u2019 training. This indicates that \nthe teachers were able to give feedback in an informational rather than controlling way in all \nclasses. \nFinally concerning the use of rationale given to individual students, Figure 2d shows a \nnoticeable increase for teacher 1 (i.e., from 4 to 5.25 for C1 and from 4.2 to 5.67 for C2) and \nfor teacher 3 (i.e., from 3 to 5.33 for C5 and from 1.33 to 6 for C6), and a stable trend for \nteacher 2 (i.e., from 3 to 3.25 for C3 and from 3.89 to 4.5 for C4). The scores for five classes \nwere above the scale midpoint, indicating that when teachers from these classes interacted \nindividually with a student, they tended to explain rules and limits rather than impose them. \nProvision of structure \nFigure 3 illustrates the change in teachers\u2019 behaviors scores related to structure, \nseparately for each class. Concerning the teachers\u2019 capacity to structure learning tasks, Figure \n3a shows a noticeable and uniform increase (about 2 units on average in the six classes) after \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n22 \n \ntheir training. In all classes, teachers used varied and challenging tasks as opposed to uniform \nones.  \nConcerning the teachers\u2019 capacity to structure students\u2019 activity, Figure 3b shows an \nincrease of 2 units on average in the 6 classes. The figure also reveals a noticeable inter-class \nvariability; the average level of structure in C3 and C6 is about 2 units lower than that for C1 \nand C2. As a whole, five classes have scores above the scale midpoint, indicating that their \nteachers gave contingent feedback and clearer goals. \nFinally, Figure 3c shows an increase in teacher use of encouragements for student \neffort and progress for all classes, with more substantial increases for C1, C4, C5, C6 (about \n2.5 units on average) than for C2 and C3 (1 unit and 0.7 unit, respectively). The graph also \ndisplays a noticeable inter-class variability (e.g., in C2 the teacher encouraged her students \ntwo times more than the teacher in C3 did).  \nInterpersonal involvement \nFigure 4 illustrates teachers\u2019 scores related to interpersonal involvement for each class, \nbefore and after their training. Concerning the whole class, Figure 4a reveals a noticeable \n(about 1.5 units) and uniform increase for all classes. C6 has a steeper slope than those for the \nother classes (about 2.5 units). All teachers exhibited more sympathetic and affectionate \nbehaviors, than cold and distant ones. \nConcerning the teacher-individual student interaction, Figure 4b shows that after \ntraining teacher 1 (i.e., from 3.5 to 4.75 for C1 and from 3.27 to 5.33 for C2) and teacher 3 \n(i.e., from 4.5 to 5.42 for C5 and from 4.75 to 6 for C6) interacted in a more sympathetic and \naffectionate manner with their students. A stable trend was observed for teacher 2 (i.e., from \n4.08 to 4.37 for C3 and from 3.88 to 4.12 for C4).  \nWere Students Receptive to the Effects of their Teachers\u2019 Training?  \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n23 \n \nStudents\u2019 collective engagement in class \nFigure 5 illustrates students\u2019 behaviors related to collective engagement for each class, \nbefore and after the teachers\u2019 training. Except for C3 in which students\u2019 collective \nengagement remained stable (i.e., from 4.27 to 4.3), the increases (about 1 unit) are evident \nand uniform in all other classes. In fact, for all classes the post-training scores are above the \nscale midpoint. \n Students\u2019 self-determined motivation \n We performed a repeated measure MANOVA to test the effect of the training on each \nof the motivational regulations. The results show a significant multivariate effect [Wilks \nlambda = 0.49; F (7, 137) = 19.93, p<.001]. Follow-up ANOVA\u2019s were significant for only 2 \nmotivational regulations (see Table 1). More specifically, students reported being less \nexternally regulated [F(1, 144) = 10.33, p < .01] and less amotivated [F(1, 144) = 6.94, p \n< .01] after their teachers\u2019 training. \nStudents\u2019 psychological need satisfaction \nSimilar to the analysis for motivational regulations, we tested the effect of teacher \ntraining on each need using a repeated measure MANOVA. The results showed a significant \nmultivariate effect [Wilks lambda = 0.33; F (3, 124) = 84.80, p<.001]. Follow-up ANOVA\u2019s \nwere significant only for the need of relatedness (see Table 1). After the teachers\u2019 training, \nstudents reported a greater satisfaction of this need [F(1, 126) = 9.19, p < .01]. \n  \nDiscussion \nGrounded on the SDT framework (e.g., Deci & Ryan, 2002), the purpose of this study \nwas to test the efficacy of a training for physical education teachers aimed to support students\u2019 \npsychological needs, self-determined motivation, and engagement in the class. Two questions \nguided this work: (1) drawing from a multidimensional approach (e.g., Reeve, et al., 2004; \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n24 \n \nSkinner & Belmont, 1993; Skinner & Edge, 2002) on teachers\u2019 interpersonal style, could the \ntraining increase teachers\u2019 autonomy-support, structure and interpersonal involvement? (2) \nWould the students be receptive to these changes in their teachers\u2019 interpersonal style by \nreporting greater psychological need satisfaction, self-determined motivation and engagement \nin learning tasks? Results are discussed in light of these two questions.  \nChanges in Teachers\u2019 Interpersonal Style  \nIn accordance with our hypothesis, results showed that teachers\u2019 participation to an \ninformational session, followed by an individualized guidance program during the last lessons \nof the cycle, fostered positive changes in the teachers\u2019 interpersonal style. For example, in \ntable tennis, teacher 1 organized for C2 a \u201cDavis cup\u201d type tournament (i.e., singles and \ndoubles matches) in which one of the organizational instructions was \u201cyou can choose the \nteammate with who you want to play\u201d. In basket ball with C4, teacher 2 showed a student \nwho performed poorly two possibilities to shoot (i.e., aim at the black rectangle at the back of \nthe ring or moving to one side and then shoot). He subsequently said to the student \u201cmaybe \nyou could try ten times each position and then choose the best\u201d. In badminton, to better adapt \nthe learning tasks to the diversity of her students\u2019 physical skills in C5, teacher 3 developed \nfor the less-skilled students a game in which they could score only in 2-meter zones situated \nat the front and at the back of the court. For the more skilled students, she developed a game \nin which they could only score when the shuttlecock fell on the ground without having been \ntouched by the opponent. Whatever the sport, the three teachers tried to give more \nencouragements such as: \u201cnow you\u2019re getting the hang of it, let\u2019s go\u201d. To better affiliate with \nthe students, they used more empathic statements such as \u201cI can see that you are starting to get \ntired, you can have a break if you want\".  \nOn the whole, teachers used need supportive behaviors more frequently after the \ninformational session, except for one autonomy supportive behavior (i.e., organizational \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n25 \n \ninstructions) whose frequency of use remained stable in 4 out of 6 classes. The latter result is \nin alignment with those reported in Tessier et al.\u2019s (2008) study, in which a similar behavior \nwas not affected by the educational program. Providing organizational instructions to the \nwhole class in an autonomy-supportive way is certainly one of the most difficult behaviors to \nadopt for teachers, especially newly qualified ones. Indeed, giving choices to students within \na group necessitates experience in class management. In addition, choices are often \nconstrained by the nature of the activity taught or the availability of equipment in the gym.     \nOur findings expand those by Reeve et al. (2004) and Chatzisarantis and Hagger \n(2009) by showing that, not only autonomy support, but all three dimensions of teachers\u2019 \ninterpersonal style are malleable. In relation to the provision of structure, the collaborative \nexercises organized during the training session gave the opportunity to the teachers to share \nwith other teachers their instructional methods and the indicators they employ to assess \nstudents\u2019 performance. It is plausible that enriched by this brainstorming of information, the \nteachers were subsequently able to give more technical advice and facilitate students\u2019 \nimprovement. As far as teacher interpersonal involvement is concerned, the analysis of their \nown interpersonal style via the video footage and the opportunity to role play the \nrecommended teaching behaviors might have helped the teachers to provide more \nperspective-talking statements and to gain a greater capacity to acknowledge and accept the \nnegative feelings associated with engaging in physically-demanding activities.  \nThe results also reveal that teacher 2 (C3 and C4) did not manage to change his \nbehaviors as much as the other two teachers did. Three autonomy supportive behaviors (i.e., \norganizational instructions, rationales given to the whole class or to a single student) and one \nbehavior related to interpersonal involvement (i.e., interactions with students) remained stable \nafter the informational session. These inter-individual differences among teachers may be due \nto personality characteristics. Deci (1995) argued that one\u2019s motivating style is partly due to \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n26 \n \npersonality. Providing empirical support for this argument, Reeve (1998) showed that prior \nbeliefs of pre-service teachers about the nature of motivation (i.e., their causality orientation) \nstrongly affected how willing they were to accept the merits of an autonomy-supportive style. \nReeve showed that pre-service teachers used more autonomy-supportive behaviors following \nan informational training only to the extent that they saw autonomy support as a superior \nalternative to their pre-existing strategies. Therefore, the weak effects of the training on \nteacher 2\u2019s behaviors may be due to conceptual resistance from this teacher. Empirical \nliterature discusses the influence of teachers\u2019 beliefs on their interpersonal style. For example, \nprevious studies have shown that the rejection of a \u201cliberal\u201d conception of education was \nlinked to an authoritarian predisposition (e.g., Natchtscheim & Hoy, 1976). Also, more recent \nresearch on value orientations6 has demonstrated the influence of these variables on the \nteachers\u2019 choices regarding curriculum content and the nature of their instructional and \nassessment decisions (e.g., Ennis & Chen, 1995). Thus, it is possible that certain beliefs and \nvalues of teacher 2 might have attenuated the effects of the intervention on his teaching \nbehaviors.  \nChanges in Student Need Satisfaction, Motivation and Engagement  \nThe main goal of this study was to promote students\u2019 psychological needs satisfaction, \nself-determined motivation and engagement in physical education lessons by manipulating \nexperimentally the interpersonal style of their physical education teachers. Concerning need \nsatisfaction, students reported a significant increase in relatedness, but no changes in \nautonomy and competence. It is possible that the positive changes in teachers\u2019 behaviors may \nhave been interpreted by the students as a mark of interest in them, increasing their feeling of \nrelatedness. Perhaps the time span was too small to see any meaningful changes in \ncompetence. To experience substantial learning in a sport takes time; six lessons in which \nonly 50 minutes to 1h10 were devoted to learning are maybe too short to make students feel \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n27 \n \nsignificantly more competent. Also, despite the substantial change in teachers\u2019 autonomy-\nsupport behaviors, this may be not enough to compensate students\u2019 feeling of control \nemanating from being in a school setting, and in turn improve their feeling of autonomy. \nAccording to Brophy (1999), from the students\u2019 point of view the school setting is a \ncontrolling one because school attendance is compulsory, curriculum content and learning \nactivities are not fun, and student work is graded.  \n With regard to motivational regulations, the results partially confirm our hypothesis. \nThe improvements in teachers\u2019 interpersonal style contributed to reductions in students\u2019 \nnon\/low self-determined motivation (i.e., amotivation and external regulation), however they \ndid not result in any increases in self-determined motivation(i.e., intrinsic motivation and \nindentified regulation). These results are not aligned with previous work, which has shown a \npositive link between autonomy supportive teacher\u2019s behaviors and student\u2019s self-determined \nmotivation in physical education (e.g., Ntoumanis, 2001, 2005; Standage, Duda, & \nNtoumanis, 2005; Taylor & Ntoumanis, 2007). Nevertheless, almost all previous studies used \ncross-sectional designs. It is important to take into account the length of time of the post-\nintervention period in our study. Indeed, it is plausible that three lessons of two hours each is \na rather short period to produce substantial changes in student self-determined motivation \n(i.e., intrinsic motivation and indentified regulation). Increasing self-determined motivation \ntakes time and requires incorporating in the self the reasons to engage in a behavior (La \nGuardia & Ryan, 2002). Further, as discussed earlier, it was difficult for the teachers to fully \nincorporate into their interpersonal style each need supportive behavior. In each teacher and \nclass, some behaviors did not significantly increase as a result of the training program. Thus, \nit is possible that changes in the teachers\u2019 behaviors had not been sufficiently large and \nconsistent to foster a greater degree of internalization of low self-determined motivations into \nmore self-determined ones (Ryan & Deci, 2000).  \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n28 \n \nThe findings pertaining to student engagement, with the exception of class 3, confirm \nour hypothesis, and are aligned with Reeve et al.\u2019s (2004) results. Post-intervention, students \nwere more engaged (physically, cognitively and affectively) than in the pre-intervention \nperiod. Teachers seem to have learnt more how to organize and communicate the content of \ntheir lessons to facilitate student engagement. Thus, the fact that teachers developed learning \ntasks that they were more adapted to the diversity of their students\u2019 physical skills, gave \nfeedback more frequently, praised and encouraged more individual effort and progress, would \nhave probably increased the actual learning time within a lesson. Further, the fact that they \nwere more involved with their students, listened to them more and offered more empathic \nstatements, must have reduced any apprehensions related to engaging in practicing new motor \nskills. Finally, the fact that the teachers offered greater support for their students\u2019 autonomy \nby suggesting different possibilities and enhancing initiative taking, must have stimulated \nstudents\u2019 cognitive activity and learning. In the same vein, the difficulties of teacher 2 to \nincrease the usage of all targeted behaviors (he was able to increase teacher\u2019s guidance, \nstructure of the learning tasks, structure of the students\u2019 activity, encouragements and praise, \ninstruction given to the whole class) could explain why his students in class 3 did not increase \ntheir engagement in lessons. This finding brings up two questions that have implications for \nthe nature of the interplay among the three dimensions of a teacher\u2019s interpersonal style. The \nfirst question is whether or when the lack of effects from any dimension cannot be \ncompensated by the positive effects of the others? The second question is, when such null \nfindings are observed, are these indicative of one of the dimensions having more weight than \nthe others in terms of predicting students\u2019 engagement? Answering such questions by \nexamining the interaction effects of a teacher\u2019s interpersonal style dimensions on students\u2019 \nengagement could help to explain why one of the classes (i.e., C3) did not show increased \nstudent collective engagement. \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n29 \n \nIt is also interesting to note that the informational session had no effect on students\u2019 \nself-determined motivation (i.e., intrinsic motivation and identified regulation), but had a \npositive effect on their engagement. This direct relation between teachers\u2019 behaviors and \nstudents\u2019 engagement has also been found in previous research in physical education (e.g., \nChatzisarantis & Hagger, 2009; Hagger et al., 2003; 2005). Future intervention studies are \nneeded to test and explain such direct effects.  \nLimitations and future directions   \nA limitation of this study is that it is unknown whether our results could be \ngeneralized to participants from different backgrounds. Our work involved newly qualified \nteachers interested in experimenting with new teaching strategies and possessing a relatively \nmalleable interpersonal style (Hoy & Woolfolk, 1990). Further, the students came from \npredominantly well-off families. It would be interesting if future research repeated this study \nwith more experienced teachers with established teaching routines and with students from less \nprivileged backgrounds. It would be also interesting to test whether our teacher training can \nhelp teachers in lessons involving less inherently interesting activities  (e.g., endurance \nrunning).  \nAnother limitation of this study is the lack of control group. One might argue that \nchanges in teachers and students\u2019 behaviors and self-reports might have been due to other \nschool contextual variables that were not controlled for in this study (e.g., expectations from \nschool authorities or parents). Although this argument cannot be entirely dismissed, we think \nthat it is unlikely to explain the observed changes. This is because the positive changes \nappeared over a short period of only 3 weeks (between the fourth and the seventh lesson). \nFurther, as far as teachers\u2019 behaviors are concerned, the school context places several \ndemands on the teachers \u2013 such as expectations from school authorities or parents \u2013 that tend \nto steer their interpersonal style toward student control than psychological need-support \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n30 \n \n(Bophy, 1999; Pelletier et al., 2002). As far as students\u2019 responses are concerned, available \nlongitudinal evidence in the literature indicates time-related decline in indices of adaptive \nmotivation during the school year (e.g., Ntoumanis et al., 2009). Given these considerations, \nwe suggest that our pattern of findings probably reflect the positive influences of our \nintervention on the teachers and students\u2019 behaviors than the influence of any unmeasured \ncontextual effects. \nFuture intervention studies on teachers\u2019 interpersonal style aiming to increase \nstudents\u2019 self-determined motivation and psychological need satisfaction should utilize a \ncontrol group and longer time frames (e.g., several months or even an entire school year). In \naddition, follow-ups are needed to test the durability of the intervention effects. It would also \nbe important to monitor the time required for novice teachers to fully understand the strategies \nand learn to plan lessons that implemented the target behaviors independently, without a \nresearcher\u2019s assistance. Furthermore, the relation between each dimension of the interpersonal \nstyle and the satisfaction of students\u2019 needs should be tested with many more classes than \nthose sampled in this study to allow for multilevel analysis. Finally, it should be interesting to \nrefine the observational grid in order to measure more comprehensively the effect of teacher \nbehaviors on student engagement. Assessing engagement at the class level certainly produces \na loss of information compared to an assessment at the individual level. Also, the cognitive \nengagement scale would benefit from expansion to include additional deeper level cognitive \ncategories (e.g., problem solving, socio-cognitive conflict, experimentation of multiple \nsolutions), that can provide a broader range of types of cognitive engagement found in the \nphysical education classes. \nIn summary, the present study replicates and expands upon previous SDT-based \nintervention studies in school settings (Chatzisarantis & Hagger, 2009; Reeve, 1998; Reeve, \nJang et al., 2004; Tessier et al., 2008).

Integrated regulation was not assessed in the present study because often this regulation has \nnot emerged as a perceived reason for participation in the physical domain (e.g., Pelletier et \nal., 1995).  \n2. The Hawthorne effect refers to the tendency of some people to work harder and perform \nbetter when they are participants in an experiment. These individuals may change their \nbehavior due to the attention they receive from researchers rather than because of any \nexperimental manipulation of independent variables. \n3. In order to be more aligned with the aims of our study, the items pertaining to the \nrelatedness dimension focused specifically on the physical education teacher and not the \nclassmates. \n4. This conceptualization has two limitations: (1) the measurement of cognitive engagement is \nhighly inferential (Appleton et al., 2006), and (2) in reality the components of engagement are \ndynamically embedded within a single individual and are not isolated processes  \n(Fredericks et al., 2004). \n5. More details about any aspect of the observation grid can be obtained from the first author.        \n6. Five different orientations have been proposed by Jewett, Bain, and Ennis (1995): \ndisciplinary mastery (the teacher focuses on the mastery of the subject matter, the content of \nfundamental movement skills, sports and physical activity skills, and fitness-related \nactivities), learning process (the teacher puts the idea of learning how to learn in the center of \nphysical education content), self-actualization (the curriculum goals are dealing with the \nstudents' needs and interests), the social responsibility (teacher is concerned about developing \npositive interpersonal relationships among their students), and the ecological integration \n(teacher emphasizes a balanced curriculum between the needs of the learner, the subject \nmatter, the educational context and social concerns).  \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n40 \n \n \n \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n41 \n \n \nTable 1 \n \nResults of Repeated Measures ANOVA\u2019s on Motivational Regulations and Psychological \nNeeds. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNote. *p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001.  \nIMS= intrinsic motivation to experience stimulation, IMA= intrinsic motivation toward \naccomplishment, IMK= intrinsic motivation toward knowledge, IDR= identified regulation, \nINR= introjected regulation, EXR= external regulation, AM= amotivation.  \n \nVariable Mpre-training Mpost-training F (1, 144) \nMotivational Regulations     \nIMS                        \nIMA                       \nIMK                        \nIDR                        \nINR                       \nEXR                      \nAM \nPsychological Needs \nAutonomy \nCompetence \nRelatedness \n \n3.66 \n3.91 \n3.74 \n3.22 \n2.71 \n3.78 \n3.09 \n \n3.21 \n4.92 \n4.54 \n \n3.97 \n3.88 \n3.63 \n3.98 \n2.60 \n3.17 \n2.53 \n \n3.09 \n4.89 \n4.85 \n \n2.37 \n0.40 \n3.19 \n1.72 \n0.21 \n10.33** \n6.95** \n \n1.78 \n0.20 \n9.19** \n   \n                                The Support of students\u2019 Psychological Needs \n \n42 \n \n \nFigure Captions \nFigure 1.
