Nixon had arrived in\nTehran the previous day from his summit meeting in Moscow with General\nSecretary Leonid Brezhnev, where he had signed a series of arms control agree-\nments with the Soviet Union. This was the era of d\u00e9tente, and Nixon and\nKissinger were lauded as its architects. While the horrors of the Vietnam War\nwere still unfolding, Nixon had made his momentous trip to Communist China\nin February, and his soaring popularity would deliver him a landslide electoral\nvictory in November over his Democratic challenger for the presidency,\nSenator George McGovern. Meanwhile, Henry Kissinger had established a\nposition of unprecedented power in the machinery of American foreign policy,\nconducting the administration\u2019s secret diplomacy in Beijing, Paris, and\nMoscow, and sidelining the nation\u2019s chief diplomat, Secretary of State William\nRogers. The shah, too, was at the apogee of his reign. Under his leadership,\nIran had enjoyed more than a decade of nearly double-digit gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) growth, commensurate with manifold increases in both oil\nincome and military expenditure.1 Pursuing what he called his \u201cIndependent\nNational Policy,\u201d he had normalized Iran\u2019s relations with the Soviet Union and\nnow sought Iranian primacy in the Persian Gulf in the wake of Britain\u2019s with-\ndrawal from the region in 1971. Mohammad Reza Shah had seen five American\npresidents pass through the White House; each in turn had frustrated and\ndisappointed him in his ambition to make Iran the region\u2019s leading power. But\nnow, under the Nixon Doctrine, the United States would rely on the shah to\nmaintain stability in the Persian Gulf. On that May morning in Tehran, Nixon\n*I would like to thank Nigel Ashton, W.

Nixon\u2019s predecessor, President Lyndon Johnson,\nhad been wary of the shah\u2019s ambition for Iranian primacy in the Gulf and instead\nsaw regional stability as resting on a balance of power between Iran and Saudi\nArabia, a policy he inherited from the British during their withdrawal from the\nGulf. Contrary to popular perceptions of Nixon\u2019s Gulf policy as one of balanc-\ning Iran and Saudi Arabia as the \u201ctwin pillars\u201d of the Gulf, between 1969 and\n1972 Nixon gradually abandoned balancing and tilted in favor of Iran.3 This\narticle is concerned with the question of why Nixon embraced Iranian primacy\nin the Gulf, whereas Johnson had rejected it. Declining Anglo-American power\nin the context of the British withdrawal from the Gulf between 1968 and 1971,\nand America\u2019s quagmire in Vietnam, do not provide an adequate explanation.4\nThese important constraints confronted both Johnson and Nixon; yet each\npresident adopted quite distinct Gulf policies. Here I make the case that the shift\nin U.S. Gulf policy from balancing under Johnson to Iranian primacy under\nNixon reflected a change in American thinking about Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.\nBecause of his long-standing friendship with the shah, Richard Nixon brought\nnew ideas to the White House about the Pahlavi monarch and his ambitions for\nIran, which stood in stark contrast with the views of both the Johnson admin-\nistration and the British. This change in American thinking provided fertile\nground for the shah\u2019s relentless efforts to secure Washington\u2019s backing for\nIranian regional primacy under the Nixon Doctrine. By lifting virtually all\nrestrictions on U.S. arms sales to Iran, Nixon allowed the shah to assume the\nregional leadership role that he had always sought for Iran.\nthe shah and P A X B R I T A N N I C A\nThe idea that security in the Persian Gulf rests on a \u201cbalance of power\u201d\nbetween Iran and Saudi Arabia finds its origins in London.

However, by the 1960s the decline of the British\nEmpire had dramatically accelerated, and on January 16, 1968 the Labour\nGovernment, led by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, announced that Britain\nwould withdraw all its military forces from the Gulf by 1971 as part of a larger\nwithdrawal \u201cEast of Suez.\u201d The decision was motivated by the Cabinet\u2019s desire\nto cut defense spending and achieve fiscal austerity in the face of a severe\neconomic crisis, while avoiding painful cuts in social spending. In order to avoid\na power vacuum following the British withdrawal, which could result in regional\ninstability and Soviet encroachment, a new balance of power would need to\nemerge to protect British interests.6\nThe solution developed by the mandarins of the British Foreign Office was\nto strengthen the British-protected states by persuading them to join together in\na single Arab federation and to encourage Saudi Arabia to play a more active role\nin the Persian Gulf, thereby providing an Arab counterweight to the shah\u2019s\nambitions for Iranian regional primacy. In 1967, the Foreign Office had pre-\npared a report on Britain\u2019s long-term policy in the Gulf, the conclusions of\nwhich were approved by the Cabinet\u2019s Defense and Overseas Policy Committee\non June 7, 1968. According to this report Britain would \u201cencourage an indig-\nenous balance of power which does not require our military presence.\u201d This\nbalance of power would depend above all on Saudi Arabia and Iran, as \u201cthey are\nalso the two best placed to bring force to bear in the area, the Saudis by virtue\nof their commanding geographical position and the Iranians through their\ngrowing naval supremacy in the Gulf. If they were at loggerheads with each\nother, local stability would be unlikely to survive our departure. Conversely if\nthey were to act in concert, or at least with mutual understanding, they could do\nmuch to ensure a peaceful transition to whatever new system follows our with-\ndrawal.\u201d7 Pax Britannica had been maintained in the Gulf by a preponderance of\nBritish naval power. After the British military withdrawal, equilibrium between\nIran and Saudi Arabia would prevent either power from dominating the Gulf,\nthereby protecting the independence of the proposed Arab federation without a\nsubstantial British military presence. But such a balance of power would not\nemerge automatically. Rather, it would have to be constructed and maintained.\n5. In 1968 these British protected states consisted of the emirates of Abu Dhabi, Ajman,\nBahrain, Dubai, Fujaira, Qatar, Ras al-Khaimah, and Umm al-Quwain.\n6. Wm.

At the time of the shah\u2019s March 1965 visit to London, British\nForeign Secretary Michael Stewart advised Wilson to \u201cdisabuse the Shah of the\nidea that, if and when we ever leave the Persian Gulf, Iran can take our place:\ngiven the Arab character of the southern shores of the Persian Gulf, and the\npretensions of Saudi Arabia and Iraq (to say nothing of the United Arab Repub-\nlic) this hope is quite illusory.\u201d8 Given their long-standing political and eco-\nnomic relationships with the Arab rulers of the Gulf, British policy was to\ncontain Iran\u2019s ambitions and reassure their Arab clients. Sir Stewart Crawford,\nthe British resident in the Gulf, advised Foreign Secretary George Brown that\nBritain should avoid any appearance of endorsing Iran\u2019s ambitions, thereby\ngiving the impression that \u201cwe shall disregard the interests of the [Arab]\nGulf States and sell them down the river.\u201d9 In March 1968, Sir Denis Wright,\nBritain\u2019s ambassador to Iran, warned his colleagues in the Foreign Office that\n\u201cThe Shah remains suspicious of our intentions and of our alleged favouritism\nof the Arabs against Iran.\u201d10 A few days later Wright traveled to London to\nparticipate in a discussion of Gulf policy convened by Goronwy Roberts, a\njunior minister in the Foreign Office. When Wright asked his colleagues\n\u201cwhether the balance of British interests in Iran had been considered against\nthose in the Arab world,\u201d he was assured that \u201con an arithmetical calculation the\nbalance was overwhelmingly in favour of the Arabs.\u201d11\nMohammad Reza Shah shared the ubiquitous Iranian mistrust of perfidious\nAlbion, stemming from more than a century of British imperialism in Iran. He\nwas convinced that London was now conspiring with the Arabs against Iran in\nanticipation of Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the Persian Gulf.12 Although the shah\u2019s\nAnglophobia was acute, given that the British had exiled his father in 1941, his\nsuspicion that British interests favored the Arabs over Iran was not unfounded.\nIn June 1968, Sir Denis Allen, undersecretary at the Foreign Office, advised\nWright that any attempt to accommodate the shah\u2019s ambitions would not only\ndisrupt the stability of the Gulf and \u201cearn us major ill-will from the Arabs,\u201d but\nwould in any event fail to \u201cearn us any permanent dividends from the Shah.\u201d13\nAlthough the British privately recognized that Iran would be the single most\n8.

Whereas Morris describes Faisal as \u201ca true\nconservative, by nature cautious and pessimistic,\u201d he calls the shah \u201cour Middle\nEast de Gaulle,\u201d \u201crestless, bold, innovative, radical.\u201d He denigrates the shah as\n\u201cthe son of the illiterate Persian sergeant, self-consciously masquerading as heir\nto the 3,000 years old Achaemenid monarchy,\u201d in contrast with Faisal, a man\nwho \u201cdislikes pomp, ceremony and luxury, and in a quiet rather snobbish way is\ncertain and therefore undemonstrative about his lineage.\u201d14 The shah would\nhave welcomed the comparison to French President Charles de Gaulle. In his\nmemoirs he wrote that when de Gaulle \u201cspoke of France, he seemed to echo the\nambitions which I nurtured for my own country: he wanted an independent\nFrance. His quiet eloquence inspired faith in his country\u2019s future . . . This great\npatriot was an example to me.\u201d15 But Morris did not intend the comparison as a\ncompliment. He saw the shah as an upstart with ambitions above his station,\nechoing the Foreign Office\u2019s anxiety that Iranian primacy would threaten\nBritain\u2019s long-term interests in the Gulf. These pejorative ideas about the shah\nand the concept of a balance of power between Iran and Saudi Arabia were the\nlegacy that the departing British bequeathed to the United States in the Gulf.\ncontinuity: johnson\u2019s balancing policy\nIn the year between the announcement of the British withdrawal from the\nPersian Gulf in January 1968 and the inauguration of the Nixon administra-\ntion in January 1969, President Lyndon Johnson had little time to formulate\nAmerica\u2019s Gulf policy. The Gulf had been a British sphere of influence and the\nUnited States had considered it Britain\u2019s responsibility to contain Soviet influ-\nence there. Johnson had agreed to subsidize Britain\u2019s global military presence,\nwhile concentrating his own attention on the Vietnam War.16 Although Britain\nhad informed the United States in April 1967 that it would be withdrawing its\nforces \u201cEast of Suez,\u201d the announcement in January 1968 that the Gulf would be\nincluded in this withdrawal disappointed the Americans and their reaction was\nmarkedly bitter.

Rusk resented what he called the \u201cacrid aroma of the\nfait accompli\u201d and contemptuously demanded, \u201cfor God\u2019s sake, be Britain\u201d!17\nThat same day Johnson wrote to Wilson expressing his \u201cdeep dismay\u201d at the\n\u201cBritish withdrawal from world affairs,\u201d which would leave the United States \u201cto\nman the ramparts all alone.\u201d18 Nonetheless, within a week of these exchanges the\nU.S. State Department began what would be a year-long process of formulating\na Gulf policy, in close consultation with the Foreign Office.19\nThe Persian Gulf was rather low on Johnson\u2019s list of priorities in 1968, as he\ngrappled with the Tet Offensive that was launched by the North Vietnamese in\nJanuary, followed by his announcement in March that he would not seek reelec-\ntion.20 Gulf policy was largely left to the State Department and rarely reached\nthe Oval Office. The Johnson administration quickly dismissed any idea of\ntaking over Britain\u2019s role and instead opted for a policy of relying on the littoral\nstates to maintain stability in the Gulf. In a careless statement made during an\ninterview with the Voice of America on January 19, U.S. Undersecretary of State\nEugene Rostow said,\nIn the Persian Gulf you have some very strong, and quite active and stable\ncountries, which are interested in taking responsibility for regional security\u2014\nIran, Turkey, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia would certainly be a nucleus, and\nKuwait\u2014would certainly be a nucleus, around which such security arrange-\nments could hopefully be built, and we can hope that in the long run the\npolicy of Iraq would orient itself in a cooperative direction so that it could\njoin in such efforts.21\nThe statement was careless for two reasons. First, it tarred any regional security\narrangement with the imprimatur of the United States, making it more difficult\nfor the Arab rulers of the Gulf to support such an arrangement, lest they be\naccused by Arab nationalists of collusion with \u201cAmerican imperialism.\u201d Further-\nmore, the clumsy reference to Turkey and Pakistan\u2014neither of which border\nthe Gulf\u2014angered both of these governments, as they had not been consulted,\nand also violated the principle that only the riparian powers would be respon-\nsible for Gulf security. In short, Rostow\u2019s poorly chosen words had the potential\nto upset Britain\u2019s plans for a regional balance of power arrangement following\n17.

Theodore Eliot, the country director for Iran at the State Depart-\nment, assured the British that Washington \u201ccould take a hand [with the shah]\nsince the United States military relationship was vital to the Iranians.\u201d24 Presi-\ndent Johnson had written to the shah in February, after a Saudi-Iranian spat over\nBahrain, to remind him that regional stability would require the shah to exercise\n\u201cpatience, understanding and a high degree of statesmanship\u201d in his relations\nwith the Saudis.25 In his stern reply to Johnson\u2019s patronizing letter, the shah said\nthat in dealing with the Saudis, he had gone \u201cas far as any one can go, but our\nefforts so far have, unfortunately, been answered by precisely the opposite\nreaction to that expected.\u201d26 Nonetheless, the U.S. ambassador to Iran, Armin\nMeyer, was convinced that Johnson\u2019s intervention had exercised a \u201crestraining\neffect\u201d on the shah.27 Similarly, the president\u2019s national security adviser, Walt\nRostow, felt that Johnson had \u201cinjected a sobering perspective at a heated\nmoment.\u201d28\nThroughout 1968, the State Department deferred to the Foreign Office to\nsuch an extent on Persian Gulf matters that American and British Gulf policy\nbecame virtually indistinguishable.

The National Security Council (NSC) staff warned of the\n\u201cbasic conflict . . . between the Iranian assumption that Iran has the mission of\ncontrolling the Gulf, and the Saudi assumption that Saudi Arabia is responsible\nfor everything on the Arabian Peninsula.\u201d Although the Americans wanted \u201cto\nstay out of the middle\u201d of this rivalry, the shah worried that Johnson had\nconspired with the British against Iran.32 Hushang Ansary, the Iranian ambas-\nsador to the United States, had conveyed these concerns to Eugene Rostow in\nFebruary, and a few weeks later, during a visit to Washington by Iranian Foreign\nMinister Ardeshir Zahedi, Dean Rusk informed his Iranian counterpart that he\nwas aware of Tehran\u2019s suspicions and assured him that they were unfounded.33\nAll Washington wanted, Rusk argued, was to promote Irano-Saudi cooperation\nas a \u201cprerequisite to peace in [the] Gulf \u201d in the interests of \u201cpreventing [the]\nexpansion [of] Soviet influence in area.\u201d34 Despite his protests, however, Rusk\n29. \u201cRecord of Conversation between the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and\nmembers of the State Department in Washington at 4.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 15 May 1968,\u201d\nFCO 8\/37.\n30. \u201cAnglo-American talks on the Middle East in the State Department, 13 September\n1968,\u201d FCO 8\/37; Memorandum of Conversation, Washington, September 13, 1968, FRUS\n1964\u20131968, XXI, 156.\n31.

In language reminiscent of\nthat used by the British, he would later recall that that shah \u201cwas influenced by\nthe dreams of the Persian Empire, he had a very lofty view of what Persia had\nbeen and perhaps could be again some day. The sense of glory in the Shah was\nat least equal to that of President de Gaulle\u2019s views about the glory of France.\u201d35\nThe shah had tried repeatedly to convince Johnson to tilt toward Iran in the\nPersian Gulf, using the Soviet threat as his argument for a policy of Iranian\nprimacy. Conscious of the American public\u2019s aversion to overseas commitments\nin the context of Vietnam, the shah had written to Johnson in August 1966\narguing that \u201cA strong Iran can . . . avert the spreading of conflicts in the region,\nguarantee the smooth and orderly flow of oil to the west and, what is of vital\nimportance and worthy of serious consideration, forestall the repetition of\ncurrent tragic and costly involvements.\u201d36 The shah firmly believed that radical\nArab states like Egypt and Iraq, supported by Moscow, endangered both stability\nin the Gulf and Iranian national security. He was particularly alarmed by Egypt\u2019s\nmilitary intervention in North Yemen as well as the Soviet- and Chinese-backed\nrebellion against the sultan of Oman in Dhofar. He feared that Moscow would\nuse radical Arab forces to subvert the conservative Arab monarchies of the Gulf,\nfrom where they could disrupt Iran\u2019s oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz\nand press Arab territorial claims against the Iranian province of Khuzistan,\nwhere much of Iran\u2019s oil reserves are located.37\nThese arguments failed to convince Johnson and his advisers. A succession of\nAmerican presidents had sought to temper Iranian military spending, fearing\nthat Iran\u2019s burgeoning defense expenditure would divert precious resources\nfrom economic development, thereby fulfilling the shah\u2019s military ambitions at\nthe cost of Iran\u2019s domestic stability. By 1968, the shah was able to exert a great\ndeal more leverage over Washington on issues such as arms sales and oil prices\nthan ever before.38 However, he was unable to convince the Johnson adminis-\ntration to abandon balancing and tilt toward Iran in the Persian Gulf. In\nFebruary 1968 the NSC\u2019s interagency review group concluded that the United\nStates should continue to pursue a balance of power in the Gulf by \u201cavoiding an\nundue military build-up by the Gulf littoral states.\u201d39 Despite the shah\u2019s constant\nrequests for ever larger quantities of American arms, in June 1968 Johnson\nwould only agree to continue providing Iran with $100 million in annual\n35.

During a tour\nof East Asia, over which the shadow of Vietnam loomed large, the presidential\nparty stopped on the island of Guam on the night of July 25, 1969. Speaking on\nbackground to reporters, and much to Kissinger\u2019s surprise, Nixon outlined his\nviews on a post-Vietnam foreign policy for the United States. He declared that\nwhile America would always keep its treaty commitments to its allies, it \u201cmust\navoid the kind of policy that will make countries in Asia so dependent upon us\nthat we are dragged into conflicts such as the one we have in Vietnam.\u201d When\nit comes to defending its Cold War allies in Asia, \u201cexcept for the threat of a\nmajor power involving nuclear weapons . . . the United States is going to\nencourage and has a right to expect that this problem will be handled by, and\nresponsibility for it taken by, the Asian nations themselves.\u201d42 Nixon\u2019s statement\nwas intended to signal to America\u2019s nervous allies in Southeast Asia that the\nUnited States would not abandon them following a withdrawal from Vietnam,\nwhile also assuring a profoundly angry American public that they would never\nagain find themselves fighting someone else\u2019s civil war. This \u201cNixon Doctrine\u201d\nwas quickly extended to the rest of the Third World, where the United States\nwould provide material assistance to regional allies like Brazil, Indonesia, Iran,\nand Zaire to manage local conflicts and contain Soviet influence without direct\nAmerican military intervention.43\nIf the Nixon administration was going to rebuild public support for American\nleadership in the Cold War at a time when the Soviet Union had achieved\nmilitary parity with the United States, then as Odd Arne Westad argues, Nixon\nwould have to recast America\u2019s global role as \u201can overseer, not an intervener.\u201d44\n40.

Therefore, the\nNixon Doctrine and superpower d\u00e9tente were inextricably linked, as the former\nwould redirect American attention and resources to the latter.45 Nixon and\nKissinger were interested in the politics of the Third World only to the extent\nthat it affected relations among the great powers. Nixon famously instructed\nKissinger early in his first term not to waste his time on the Third World, \u201cas\nwhat happens in those parts of the world is not, in the final analysis, going to\nhave any significant effect on the success of our foreign policy in the foreseeable\nfuture.\u201d46 The Middle East was of interest to Nixon and Kissinger mainly\nbecause the Arab-Israeli conflict impinged on superpower relations and Persian\nGulf oil fueled the economies of America\u2019s allies in Asia and Europe. Kissinger\nreadily admitted that in 1969 he had no understanding of Gulf politics: \u201cI did\nnot know how Saudi-Iranian relations worked, my priority was to get the Soviets\nout of the Middle East.\u201d47 As Jussi Hanhim\u00e4ki argues, \u201cThe overall emphasis on\nthe \u2018great powers\u2019 blinded Nixon and Kissinger to the specific local circum-\nstances that determined the course of the numerous regional conflicts the\nadministration encountered.\u201d48 The Nixon Doctrine was a way of limiting and\nsimplifying American intervention in the Third World, and the Gulf was no\nexception. Preoccupied with superpower d\u00e9tente, engagement with China, and\nthe war in Vietnam, Nixon and Kissinger reduced the complexities of regional\npolitics to a simple question of whether Iran was capable of keeping the peace in\nthe Gulf after the British withdrawal.\nThroughout the period of 1969 to 1972 the shah aggressively lobbied Nixon\nto convince him that Iran could indeed fill the vacuum left by the British in the\nPersian Gulf. He employed the language of the Nixon Doctrine to argue that\nthe United States should provide Iran with the necessary arms to maintain the\nsecurity and stability of the Gulf without direct American military intervention.\nRelations with Iran were higher on the Nixon administration\u2019s agenda than\nformulating a broad Gulf policy, thanks in large measure to the warm personal\nrelationship between Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and Richard Nixon.

They maintained their friendship\nthroughout Nixon\u2019s years in the political wilderness and met in Tehran in April\n1967 during Nixon\u2019s tour of Asia, which was intended to burnish the former\nvice president\u2019s already impressive foreign policy credentials ahead of the 1968\npresidential election.50\nOver lunch atNiavaran Palace on April 22, 1967, the two old friends lamented\nthe loss of American confidence in the age of Vietnam. After surveying the Cold\nWar in Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia, the shah told Nixon that it was\n\u201cbetter for [the] U.S. to have Iran able to defend [it]self than to have . . . another\nVietnam.\u201d In his handwritten notes of their conversation, Nixon recorded that\nthe shah\u2019s views echoed the \u201cRN Doctrine.\u201d Planting the seed of what would\nbecome Nixon\u2019s Persian Gulf policy, the shah boasted that by 1971 \u201cIran will be\nable to help [the] Saudis if required,\u201d though at the time, Nixon thought this\nclaim to be \u201cover optimistic.\u201d The shah complained to Nixon that the \u201cHarvard\nboys\u201d in the Johnson administration\u2014liberal intellectuals who wanted to curtail\nIran\u2019s military spending\u2014enjoyed far too much influence over U.S. foreign\npolicy.

When the shah visited Washington in April 1969 for President\nEisenhower\u2019s funeral, the White House was expecting him to press Nixon to\nabandon balancing in the Gulf and acknowledge Iran as the paramount power\nof the region.54 The U.S. intelligence community had warned the new admin-\nistration in a National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) in January that, \u201cwith the\nimpending British withdrawal from the Persian Gulf, Iran is vigorously assert-\ning its own claim to a leading position there, thus running afoul of the aspi-\nrations of Saudi Arabia.\u201d Nixon and Kissinger would confront an Iranian ruler\nwho was certain that \u201che is master in his own house,\u201d confidently \u201cseeking for\nIran the position in regional affairs that he deems to be rightfully his.\u201d55 At his\nfirst-ever meeting with Kissinger, the shah reiterated the same warnings about\nthe Soviet and radical Arab threat to the Gulf that he had expressed to\nJohnson.56 Asadollah Alam, the minister of the imperial court and the shah\u2019s\nclosest adviser, accompanied his boss to Washington and recorded in his diary\nthat the shah\nasked the Americans to consider the advantages they receive from their\nfriendship with us. He stressed that Iran is not an American stooge but that\nwe nevertheless prefer to remain independent of Soviet influence. Iran is a\nfriend of the West sufficiently powerful to maintain her own sovereignty, able\nto defend her own interests and by implication capable of defending the\ninterests of her western friends.57\ncrisis in the shatt\nDespite this relentless pressure from the shah, the shift in U.S. Persian Gulf\npolicy from balancing to Iranian primacy was a slow evolutionary process. In\n1969, many of the same American officials who had implemented Johnson\u2019s\nbalancing policy remained in place such as Ambassador Armin Meyer in Tehran\nand Iran Country Director Theodore Eliot at the State Department. Echoes of\nJohnson\u2019s policy were apparent in the American response to the border crisis\nbetween Iran and Iraq over the Shatt al-Arab waterway in the spring of 1969,\nwhich threatened to escalate into war. The two countries had long disagreed on\nwhere their common border lay, with the Iraqis claiming sovereignty over the\nentire Shatt based on their reading of the 1937 Tehran Treaty, while the Iranians\n54.

Iraq asserted its sovereignty over the entire waterway by demanding\nthat vessels sailing in the Shatt should neither raise the Iranian flag nor carry\nIranian naval personnel. On April 15, Iraq\u2019s deputy foreign minister warned the\nIranian ambassador in Baghdad that if Iran did not comply, Iraq would use force\nto block access to Iranian ports. Iran\u2019s response was to abrogate the 1937 treaty\nand to warn the Iraqis that any interference with Iranian shipping would\nmean war.59\nThe shah\u2019s uncompromising reaction to the Iraqi threat was entirely consis-\ntent with the bold claims he had made in Washington just two weeks earlier and\nthe American assessment contained in the January NIE. However, the shah\u2019s\nadvisers worried that if Iran were seen as the aggressor in a war with Iraq, then\nthey would lose the support of the United States and find themselves fighting the\nSoviet-backed Iraqis all alone. Alam was visiting his family estate in Birjand in\neastern Iran when he received a frantic telephone call on April 17 from Gen.\nNematollah Nasiri, the chief of Iran\u2019s intelligence service, SAVAK, urging him to\nreturn toTehran immediately.60 It seemed that the shahwas planning on ordering\nan Iranianmerchant ship to sail down the Shatt flying the Iranian flag, escorted by\nthe Iranian air force and navy, as a test case to demonstrate Iranian sovereignty.\nFearing that hostilities might break out, Nasiri begged Alam to use his influence\nwith the shah to avert a war. Alam concurred, worrying that if Iran were seen as\nthe aggressor, \u201cAmerican public opinion will easily turn against us.\u201d He imme-\ndiately cabled his concerns to the shah who was then on a state visit to Tunisia.61\nAmbassador Meyer was aware of the rising military tensions between Iran\nand Iraq thanks to reports he was receiving from the U.S. Consulate in Khor-\nramshahr near the border.62 According to Gen.

Fazeli\nconveyed Meyer\u2019s comments to Hoveyda, who then instructed Afshar to report\nthem to the shah in Tunisia.65\nOne can imagine the shah\u2019s fury in Tunis upon reading the messages from\nAlam and Afshar advising restraint in the Shatt, lest Iran\u2019s actions anger the\nUnited States. He was in no mood to back down, cabling back to Alam that \u201cyou\nare not in the picture on this issue. They [the Iraqis] have caused such offence\nthat these actions are necessary.\u201d66 On instructions from the shah, Afshar sum-\nmoned Meyer to his home on the morning of April 18, where he conveyed the\nshah\u2019s displeasure with the ambassador\u2019s comments to Fazeli and asked Meyer\n\u201cwhether [the] Shah in assuring Iran\u2019s legitimate self-defense should seek sup-\nplies from quarters where no conditions [are] attached.\u201d Meyer responded by\nrefuting Fazeli\u2019s account and assuring Afshar that he had spoken without any\ninstructions from Washington.

Gen. Mohammad Khatam,\ncommander of the Imperial Iranian Air Force (IIAF) and brother-in-law to the\nshah, had been ordered by the shah to report on the ability of Iran\u2019s American-\nsupplied F-4 Phantom jets to support military operations against Iraq. Khatam\nasked the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) in Tehran if they\nwould be willing to transfer the U.S. Air Force (USAF) technicians who main-\ntained Iran\u2019s Phantoms to air bases in southern Iran, to support IIAF operations\nagainst Iraq. When the request was rejected by Gen. Roy Casbeer, who headed\nthe USAF section of MAAG, Khatam agreed to Meyer\u2019s suggestion that the\ndecision not be appealed to Washington, where it would certainly be denied and\nwould only damage Iran\u2019s relations with the United States. Meyer was con-\nvinced that Khatam and other Iranian officials, knowing that Washington would\nresist being drawn into the crisis, were using the threat of a rupture in relations\nwith the United States to try to constrain the shah and prevent a war with Iraq.69\nDespite calls for restraint from both the U.S. ambassador and his closest\ncivilian and military advisers, the shah sent Afshar before the Iranian Senate on\nApril 19 to abrogate the 1937 treaty and warn that Iran would retaliate against\nany Iraqi attack.70 In the face of overwhelming Iranian military power, the Iraqis\nbacked down. On April 20, Iraqi Defense Minister Hardan al-Takriti informed\nthe SAVAK station chief in Baghdad that Iraq had no appetite for a war with\nIran.71 The Iraqis privately relayed a message that they would not challenge the\ntest-case Iranian ship.72 Waiting until the shah had returned to Tehran, Iran\nended the crisis by sailing the freighter Abu Sina down the Shatt flying the\nIranian flag with an air and naval escort. As expected, the Abu Sina did not meet\nany resistance from the Iraqis, and the crisis ended in victory for Iran.73 The\nShatt crisis left little doubt about the shah\u2019s resolve to assert Iran\u2019s power in the\nPersian Gulf against any regional rival.

Rather, Washington should help\nIran \u201cstand by itself if necessary\u201d as the protector of the waterway.81\nBetween 1970 and 1972, Iran and the Persian Gulf became largely synony-\nmous in the minds of Nixon and Kissinger. Nixon wrote to the shah in February\n1970 to tell him that he shared the shah\u2019s view that Iran should play an impor-\ntant role in the Nixon Doctrine: \u201cAs you know, your thoughts and mine coincide\nat many points on this subject, and a number of the positions I expressed during\nmy Asian trip last summer\u2014as you have noted\u2014would apply to the problems in\nyour region as well.\u201d82 Nixon was clearly intrigued by the idea that Iran, as the\nparamount power of the Gulf, could contain Soviet influence in that vital theater\nof the Cold War. In the spring of 1970, during a meeting with the Central Treaty\nOrganization (CENTO) foreign ministers in Washington, the president asked\nJoseph Sisco, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern and South Asian\naffairs, to prepare a study on whether Iran could indeed play such a role.83 The\nfirst real test of this changing American attitude toward the shah came in April\nwhen Douglas MacArthur II, U.S. ambassador to Iran, recommended that the\nUnited States extend the annual commitment on foreign military sales (FMS)\ncredits that Johnson had made to the shah in June 1968 for an additional three\nor four years. MacArthur was responding to the shah\u2019s repeated demands that\nIran\u2019s military needed larger quantities of American weapons to prepare for the\nrole they would play after the British withdrawal from the Gulf.84\nAmbassador MacArthur\u2019s recommendation set off a bureaucratic battle in\nWashington over arms sales to Iran with major implications for the ongoing\nreview of Persian Gulf policy. The principal opposition came from the Penta-\ngon, particularly G. Warren Nutter, a University of Chicago\u2013trained economist\nwho served as assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs. The\nPentagon objected that Iran did not have the absorptive capacity for integrating\nthe large volume of sophisticated weapons\u2014including four additional squadrons\nof F-4 Phantoms\u2014in the short span of time that the shah envisaged and that a\ndecision to increase arms sales to Iran would prejudice the ongoing review of\nGulf policy.85 Others in the administration were eager to avoid angering the\n80.

Jack\nMiklos, who had replaced Eliot as country director for Iran at the State Depart-\nment, was a \u201clong-time friend\u201d of Harold Saunders, the principal aide on\nKissinger\u2019s NSC staff dealing with Iran. Miklos thought that acquiescing to the\nshah\u2019s request was \u201ca very wise, sound approach\u201d and with support from Saun-\nders at the NSC was able to overcome the Pentagon\u2019s objections.86 Unlike\nbroader Middle East issues, where a major difference in views emerged between\nKissinger\u2019s NSC staff and the State Department, the two bureaucracies were\nlargely of the same mind when it came to Iran and the Gulf. The prevailing view,\nwhich Undersecretary of State Elliot Richardson expressed to Gen. Earle\nWheeler, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was that despite Nutter\u2019s\nconcerns, \u201cwe have no real option but to bank on Iran.\u201d87 Richard Helms, the\ndirector of central intelligence, advised the White House that \u201cit is in our own\ninterest to support this concept of a special relationship with Iran\u201d and reminded\nhis colleagues of the vital intelligence the United States gathered on the Soviet\nUnion from American listening posts in northern Iran.88 By April 1970, a\nconsensus had emerged in the administration that Iran, and Iran alone, could be\nrelied upon to contain Soviet influence in the Gulf. After all, the shah asked\nAmbassador MacArthur, \u201cwho else in the area can supply a credible military\ndeterrent in the Gulf? Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the small weak Gulf States? Of\ncourse not.\u201d89\nKissinger cautiously weighed in on the side of the shah and, with the presi-\ndent\u2019s approval, authorized Undersecretary Richardson to inform the shah in\nTehran in April 1970 that the United States would be willing to extend the 1968\nFMS commitment.90 Richardson told the shah that \u201cwe fully appreciate [the]\nunique contribution Iran can make to [the] defense of free world interest in [the]\nGulf.\u201d91 The \u201cspecial relationship\u201d that the shah had failed to secure in his two\ntrips to Washington in 1969 was now, just a year later, taking shape.

On\nthe face of it, the report considered five main options for U.S. policy in the\nGulf: (1) assuming the role in the Gulf abandoned by Britain, (2) backing either\nIran or Saudi Arabia as a \u201cchosen instrument\u201d, (3) promoting Saudi-Iranian\ncooperation, (4) establishing bilateral relations and a major U.S. presence in\nthe Lower Gulf, or (5) sponsoring a regional security pact. However, given the\nAmerican public\u2019s complete aversion to any expansion of America\u2019s global com-\nmitments in the context of Vietnam, the only real choice confronting Nixon was\nwhether to continue with Johnson\u2019s balancing policy (Option 3) or to back Iran\n(Option 2).92\nKissinger\u2019s staff saw Iranian primacy in the Persian Gulf as a sound choice,\ngiven that Iran was \u201cthe most powerful and most stable state in the area\u201d and\nthat \u201cthere are strong elements of this in what we are already doing.\u201d However,\nthey feared that openly backing the shah would \u201calienate the Saudis.\u201d Therefore,\nthey argued, \u201cThe logical strategy lies in marrying what is already in fact\nextensive support for Iran as the unquestioned power in the area with the logic\nof cooperation between a strong Iran and a weak Saudi Arabia.\u201d93 While the\nsubstance of this new Gulf policy would be Iranian primacy, its rhetoric would\npay lip service to Saudi-Iranian cooperation so as to avoid offending Arab\nsensibilities. Miklos later recalled that the idea of Saudi Arabia as a \u201cpillar\u201d of\nU.S. policy in the Gulf was considered \u201cludicrous.\u201d94 On June 5, 1970, Kissinger\nconvened a meeting of the NSC\u2019s Review Group to discuss the NSC\/IG report.\nIn a brief twenty-minute meeting, the Review Group approved the report and\nagreed that it was ready for the president\u2019s consideration.95 There were signs by\nthe summer of 1970 that Nixon was seriously contemplating whether the \u201cthe\nShah\u2019s ideas for Iran . . . playing a greater role in the Persian Gulf \u201d were fea-\nsible.

By comparison, the shah looked secure on his\nthrone, and Iran seemed to be the cornerstone of a largely stable Persian Gulf.\nThe shah had embarked on a diplomatic charm offensive in the Arab world,\npeacefully relinquishing Iran\u2019s claim to Bahrain in May and restoring diplomatic\nrelations with Egypt in August after a ten-year rupture.97 It was in this context\nthat Kissinger presented the NSC\/IG report to President Nixon, who approved\na general U.S. strategy in the Gulf that would \u201cpromote Saudi-Iranian coop-\neration as the mainstay of a stable regional system,\u201d \u201crecognize that Iran is in\nfact the preponderant power in the Gulf,\u201d and \u201cdo what we can to develop a\nworking relationship with the new political entities in the lower Gulf.\u201d This\nstrategy rested, according to Kissinger, on the assumption that, \u201cIf a radical\nregime were to take over in Saudi Arabia, the U.S. would have little choice but\nto move closer to Iran\u2014and there is no reason now not to go on preparing Iran\nfor that contingency.\u201d98\nWith the benefit of hindsight, it seems counterintuitive that Nixon and\nKissinger would see the shah as a safe bet and the Saudis as a long-term liability.\nWhile Mohammad Reza Shah would be deposed and exiled in 1979, the Saudi\nmonarchy would survive the assassination of King Faisal in 1975 and successfully\nmanage the succession to Kings Khalid, Fahd, and Abdullah. But in the autumn\nof 1970, many American observers imagined that a strong Iran might one day\nhave to come to the aid a weak Saudi Arabia. At the Islamic summit conference\nin Rabat in September 1969, the shah had assured Faisal that although a security\npact between their two countries was not feasible, he would provide the Saudis\nwith whatever support they asked for in a crisis.99 As MacArthur observed from\nTehran, there was a growing consensus among the Arab rulers of the Persian\nGulf that after the British withdrawal, Iran would be the only \u201cmoderate neigh-\nbor with both the will and the capacity to come to their aid.\u201d100 Just a few months\nafter the Rabat conference, when South Yemeni forces attacked Saudi Arabia,\nFaisal turned to Iran for help and the shah quickly airlifted anti-aircraft guns and\nanti-tank recoilless rifles to Saudi Arabia to repel the Yemenis.101 The shah also\n97.

Harold Saunders later recalled\nthat Iran was, in fact, the sole pillar of Nixon\u2019s Gulf policy, \u201cwith the Saudi pillar\nbeing a nominal pillar there for obvious necessary regional political reasons.\u201d104\nThe United States had important economic interests in oil-rich Saudi Arabia.\nBy 1969, their bilateral economic relationship contributed $500 million annu-\nally to America\u2019s balance of payments, and moreover, Saudi Arabia\u2019s ability to\nprovide a steady flow of cheap oil to Western Europe and Japan was a vital\nAmerican interest.105 However, the Saudis were unwilling to play a regional role\nthat would leave them open to accusations from Arab nationalists of complicity\nin American or Iranian \u201cimperialism.\u201d Both British and American diplomats in\nSaudi Arabia were aware that Saudi reticence was tilting the balance of power in\nthe Persian Gulf in Iran\u2019s favor.106 In Anglo-American discussions in Washing-\nton in March 1969, Geoffrey Arthur, assistant undersecretary at the Foreign\nOffice, complained to his American counterparts that the Saudis had been\n\u201cpassive in their relations with the Gulf \u201d and asked the Americans for their\nviews on \u201cSaudi inattention to Gulf matters.\u201d William Brewer, the State Depart-\nment\u2019s country director for the Arabian Peninsula, responded \u201cthat the Saudi\nattitude could be explained by a combination of slothfulness, statesmanship and\npreoccupation with other matters,\u201d a reference to Saudi fears of growing Israeli\npower in the aftermath of the Six-Day War of June 1967.107 Saudi reticence was\nno match for the shah\u2019s vigorous diplomacy. The following year, the British\nResidency in the Gulf concluded that the Saudis \u201chave chalked up the same nil\nscore as in previous years\u201d in their rivalry with Iran.108\n102.

Zionism is in collusion with Communism for the destruction of the\nworld,\u201d and went on to argue that the anti-war demonstrations in the United\nStates were in fact part of a Zionist-Communist global conspiracy.111 This\nhostility toward Israel, whether rhetorical or indeed \u201cdeeply felt\u201d as Kissinger\nthought it to be, stood in contrast to the shah\u2019s quiet military, intelligence and\ntrade relationship with Israel that dated back to the 1950s.112 According to\nGen. Mansur Qadar, who served as Iran\u2019s ambassador to Jordan and Lebanon\nthroughout this period, Iran\u2019s close relations with Israel made the shah deeply\nunpopular in Arab public opinion.113 Consequently, the Saudis could not afford\nto be seen as having too cozy a relationship with the shah. Foreign Minister\nZahedi confided to MacArthur in May 1971, after a brief stopover in Tehran by\nthe Saudi king, that \u201cwhile Faisal and the Saudis make all the right noises in\nprivate about [the] desirability and need for close Saudi-Iranian cooperation and\ncoordination in [the] Gulf area, they don\u2019t even want to hint about this in\npublic.\u201d114 Nixon\u2019s view was that whereas America\u2019s alliance with Israel \u201cmakes\nus unpalatable to everybody in the Arab world,\u201d the shah is \u201cawfully good on\nthat subject.\u201d115 If there were two states that constituted the \u201ctwin pillars\u201d of the\nNixon Doctrine in the Middle East, they were Iran and Israel, not Saudi Arabia.\nIn the evolution of Nixon\u2019s Persian Gulf policy between 1969 and 1972,\ndomestic instability and succession problems in Saudi Arabia cast doubt on\nthe kingdom\u2019s ability to act as a viable regional partner for the United States.\n109.

Conversation among President Nixon, MacArthur, and Haig, April 8, 1971, Wash-\nington, FRUS 1969\u20131976, E-4, 122.\nNixon, Kissinger, and the Shah : 359\nThe shah was seen by the United States as a modernizing monarch, having\ninaugurated his \u201cWhite Revolution\u201d of social and economic reforms in the early\n1960s.116 Iran\u2019s progress was trumpeted by the U.S. Information Agency as a\n\u201cmodel\u201d for the entire region.117 This stood in stark contrast with the deeply\nconservative King Faisal, whose leadership was characterized in an April 1970\nNIE as \u201cmore appropriate to the problems of the past than to those of the\npresent and future. He is deeply religious in the context of the rigid Muslim\northodoxy which still characterizes many Saudis, and in large measure he is\nattuned to the desires of the traditional elements of the society.\u201d118 At the Rabat\nconference in September 1969 the shah had lectured Faisal on the need for\nsocial and economic reform in Saudi Arabia, if the monarchy was to weather the\npolitical storms ahead.119 The shah never missed an opportunity to remind his\nAmerican interlocutors that the Saudis were \u201cvery backward\u201d and showed \u201cno\ninclination to reform.\u201d120 This reluctance to modernize, the shah argued, made\nthem deeply vulnerable to the subversive threat posed by the Soviet-backed\nradical Arabs.121\nAlthough Faisal had managed to wrestle the crown from King Saud in 1964\nafter a long internal power struggle, American assessments of the stability of the\nmonarchy were cautious. In the summer of 1969 the Saudis uncovered a coup\nplot that involved air force officers who hoped to overthrow the monarchy and\nestablish a Nasserist regime. The coup was followed by a brutal and widespread\ncrackdown on anyone suspected of disloyalty, and a crisis atmosphere pervaded\nthe kingdom, particularly after the overthrow of the Libyan monarchy in Sep-\ntember 1969.122 By November, the NSC\/IG had concluded that although there\nwas little likelihood of unrest in Saudi Arabia in the short term, \u201cin the longer\nrun we cannot assume the continuation of the political and social order upon\nwhich U.S.-Saudi cooperation was built.\u201d123 Faisal\u2019s health was in doubt, as he\nmade numerous trips to Geneva throughout 1970 for treatment and surgery, and\nthe perennial problem of royal succession loomed.124 In April 1970 the U.S.\nintelligence community concluded that in the event of Faisal\u2019s death, \u201ca smooth\n116.

Sur-\nveying the two shores, they concluded that \u201cwhat is impressive is the contrast\nbetween the Iranian image of strength and planning and the fact that the Arabs\nare divided, uncertain, suspicious and fearful. . . . The lopsided situation has its\nown seeds of instability. The U.S. problem lies not on the Iranian side\u2014where\na firm relationship can be built upon\u2014but on the Arab side.\u201d126 The ghost of\nJohnson\u2019s policy of balancing Iran and Saudi Arabia was now well and truly laid\nto rest. As Kissinger\u2019s deputy, Gen. Alexander Haig, would later recall, the shah\n\u201crepresented the political center in his own country and also in a region in\nsearch of a political center of balance.\u201d127 A new policy of Iranian primacy would\neventually entail lifting virtually all restrictions on American conventional arms\nsales to Iran, thereby giving the Iranian armed forces the ability to deter any\naggression by a regional rival. As the shah had explained to Secretary of State\nWilliam Rogers, Iran \u201cmust have an \u2018over-kill\u2019 capability so that should anyone\nbe tempted to attack Iran they would think twice or even three times.\u201d128 Despite\nthe Pentagon\u2019s continuing objection that an Iranian deterrence capability would\nspark a regional arms race, Nixon signed National Security Decision Memo-\nrandum (NSDM) 92 on November 7, 1970, ordering a policy of promoting\nSaudi-Iranian cooperation while \u201crecognizing the preponderance of Iranian\npower\u201d in the Gulf.129 NSDM 92marked a turning point in the evolution of U.S.\nGulf policy from balancing to Iranian primacy.\nred star over baghdad\nIn accounting for this American tilt toward Iran in the Persian Gulf,\nKissinger has challenged the view that Nixon\u2019s personal relationship with the\nshah played any role in U.S. policy: \u201cAmerica\u2019s friendship with Iran reflected not\nindividual proclivities but geopolitical realities. Iran\u2019s intrinsic importance tran-\nscended the personalities of both countries\u2019 leaders.\u201d130 Kissinger explains that\nhe and Nixon backed a policy of Iranian primacy in order to contain the radical\nSoviet-backed Ba\u2019th regime in Iraq, which seized power in a military coup in\nJuly 1968.

They\nsigned an agreement with Moscow in July 1969 for exploitation of the North\nRumeila oil field, followed by a series of military and economic assistance\nagreements that culminated in the fifteen-year Treaty of Friendship and Coop-\neration signed in April 1972. Washington was taking note of Iraq\u2019s burgeoning\nties with the Soviet Union as well as the nationalization in June of the Iraq\nPetroleum Company, owned by a consortium of Western firms including Mobil\nand Standard Oil of New Jersey. According to Kissinger, \u201cIraq was thereby\ntransforming itself into a geopolitical challenge and was on the way to becoming\nthe principle Soviet ally in the area.\u201d131 He and Nixon wanted to ensure that\n\u201cThe vacuum left by British withdrawal, now menaced by Soviet intrusion and\nradical momentum, would be filled by a local power friendly to us.\u201d132 The\nlogical choice was Iran, given its power and ambitions.\nKissinger\u2019s geopolitical calculations reflected his superficial understanding of\nthe Persian Gulf region. In reality, the Ba\u2019thi regime was too busy consolidating\nits weak position at home to pose much of a subversive threat abroad. By the\nsummer of 1968, the State Department\u2019s assessment was that the Ba\u2019th would\nnot last long in power, despite their extensive use of violence.133 They had to\ncontend not only with their opponents in Baghdad, but also with a Kurdish\ninsurgency in northern Iraq as well as the threat of another war with Israel.134\nThe shah had demonstrated Iran\u2019s military superiority over Iraq in the Shatt\ncrisis of April 1969. Iraq, weakened by the purges and instability of a military\ncoup, had far more to fear from Iran, than vice versa. The Ba\u2019th could do little\nmore than broadcast anti-shah propaganda on Radio Baghdad, for example,\naccusing him in July 1969 of being homosexual.135 Following a particularly\nvitriolic Iraqi broadcast, Alam recorded in his diary on August 9 that \u201cif our\nfriends and allies let us,\u201d Iran would \u201csort them out.\u201d136 Covertly, Iran tried to\noverthrow the Ba\u2019th regime, sponsoring two unsuccessful coup attempts in\nBaghdad in the summer of 1969 and in January 1970.137 As for the Soviet Union,\n131.

The Soviet Union was playing a \u201cbalancing act\u201d\nbetween Iran and Iraq, hoping to nudge the shah toward a nonaligned position\nwhile cultivating Ba\u2019thi Iraq as its local client.139\nThe advice that Nixon and Kissinger were receiving was that there were\ntensions in Soviet-Iraqi relations and that Soviet aid to Iraq posed little threat\nto either Iran or the Persian Gulf.140 In the briefing papers prepared for\nNixon\u2019s trip to Tehran in May 1972, written just one month after the signing\nof the Iraqi-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, the State Department argued that\nSoviet influence in Iraq may actually constrain and moderate Iraqi behavior,\ngiven Moscow\u2019s support for a peaceful settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict\nand its normalization of relations with Iran.141 The NSC staff advised Nixon\nthat Ba\u2019thi Iraq was \u201cregarded as about the most unreliable and least realistic\nof Mid-East states, even in the view of other Arabs. This has meant not only\nIraq\u2019s isolation within the Arab world but also ambivalent and unsteady rela-\ntions with the outside world and great powers, including the Soviet Union.\u201d142\nNor did America\u2019s British allies see Iraq as a real danger to Gulf stability. For\nexample, Sir William Luce, Britain\u2019s special envoy for the Gulf, told the State\nDepartment in January 1971 that \u201cIraq has relatively little scope for doing\nmischief in the Persian Gulf states. The people of the area dislike the Iraqis,\nand Iraq is probably too fearful of Iran\u2019s reaction to risk any adventures in\nthe Gulf.\u201d143\nWhy, then, were Nixon and Kissinger apparently convinced of the need\nto help Iran contain the danger from Soviet-backed Iraq, despite all the\nJanuary 23, 1970, FRUS 1969\u20131976, E-4, 265; McKearney (Baghdad) to Acland (London),\nJanuary 24, 1970, FCO 17\/1240; Symons (Baghdad) to Hinchcliffe (London), January 31, 1970,\nFCO 17\/1240; Balfour Paul (Baghdad) to Tripp (London), January 31, 1970, FCO 17\/1240;\nAlam, Yad\u2018dashtha-yi \u2018Alam, I: 355\u201356; Majeed Mehran, Dar kuridurha-yi Vizarat-i Umur-i\nKharijah chih khabar: khatirat-i yak diplumat-i qadimi [In the Corridors of the Ministry of\nForeign Affairs: the Memoirs of a Retired Diplomat] (Tehran, 2004), 415\u201318.\n138.

The answer lies in the nature of the relationship between Nixon,\nKissinger, and the shah. Absorbed with the Vietnam War, d\u00e9tente with the\nSoviet Union, the opening to China, and seeking a second term in office,\nNixon and Kissinger had little time to devote to the complexities of Iraqi or\nPersian Gulf politics. Instead, they relied on the shah\u2019s judgment on local\nissues as their regional partner under the Nixon Doctrine. They discussed Iraq\nwith the shah during their meetings in Tehran on May 30 and 31, 1972. The\nshah made a direct appeal for the United States to help Iran foment the\nKurdish rebellion in northern Iraq, in order to paralyze the Ba\u2019thi regime in\nBaghdad and block Soviet influence in Iraq.144 A few months after the Tehran\nvisit, Nixon authorized a covert CIA operation to arm and finance the Kurdish\ninsurgency in Iraq, despite the \u201cmajor view in town,\u201d as Harold Saunders put\nit, \u201cthat we should stay out of direct support for the Kurds.\u201d145 The arguments\nin favor of U.S. intervention in Iraqi Kurdistan were weak. But over the objec-\ntions of their own advisers, Nixon and Kissinger supported Iran\u2019s Kurdish\neffort \u201cprimarily as a favor\u201d to the shah, as a leaked congressional report on\nU.S. covert operations later concluded.146 American support for Iran against\nIraq in 1972 was an affirmation of, not an explanation for, the policy of Iranian\nprimacy established in NSDM 92 of November 1970. Nixon and Kissinger\nwere seeing Iraq and the Gulf through the shah\u2019s eyes. Kissinger later wrote\nthat some of the shah\u2019s \u201canalysis was, of course, self-serving in the sense of\nproviding a rationale for existing policy. But self-interest is no inhibition\nagainst accuracy.\u201d147\nrethinking the shah\nAn account of the origins of Nixon\u2019s Persian Gulf policy that simply exam-\nines the constraints on American decision making only tells half the story.\nAmerica\u2019s war in Vietnam and the British withdrawal from the Persian Gulf\nboth limited Washington\u2019s options in the Gulf. But when confronted with these\nfactors, Johnson and Nixon adopted distinct Gulf policies. To understand why\nJohnson chose to continue with a British policy of balancing Iran and Saudi\nArabia, while Nixon opted for Iranian primacy, we need to also consider the shift\nin American thinking about the shah from Johnson to Nixon. As discussed\nearlier, two ideas lay just below the surface of the balancing policy developed in\n144.

The first was that Mohammad Reza\nShah was an upstart\u2014the \u201cMiddle East de Gaulle\u201d\u2014whose ambitions for\nIranian primacy would lead to regional instability and invite Soviet subversion.\nThe second was that the shah\u2019s insatiable appetite for U.S. arms was diverting\nresources away from Iran\u2019s economic development. Both of these ideas were\nabsent in Nixon and Kissinger\u2019s thinking, thereby creating an opportunity for\nthe shah to push the White House to abandon balancing in favor of Iranian\nprimacy.\nAn Oval Office conversation in April 1971 between Nixon, Haig, and Mac-\nArthur reveals the clear differences between Nixon\u2019s views on the shah, based\non their long-standing friendship, and those of Johnson\u2019s advisers or the British.\nGone is any notion of the shah as a dangerous upstart. The question now is not\nhow to contain the shah\u2019s ambitions but instead whether the shah is indeed up\nto the task of fulfilling them. Nixon declares that he is \u201cstronger than horse-\nradish\u201d for the shah but asks his advisers if the shah can \u201cfill that\u2014the role out\nthere, you know, in the whole darn Gulf area.\u201d He wants to know if the shah has\n\u201cgot the stuff \u201d or is he \u201cthinking too big\u201d? Nixon tells his advisers, \u201cIf he could\ndo it, it\u2019d be wonderful because he\u2019s our friend.\u201d \u201cI like him, I like him, and I like\nthe country. And some of those other bastards out there I don\u2019t like.\u201d In Nixon\u2019s\nview Iran is America\u2019s \u201cone friend there\u201d and \u201cby God if we can go with them,\nand we can have them strong, and they\u2019re in the centre of it, and a friend of the\nUnited States, I couldn\u2019t agree more\u2014it\u2019s something.\u201d148\nAlthough Kissinger did not meet the shah until 1969, his views on the Iranian\nmonarch were entirely in accord with those of Nixon. In his memoirs he\nvigorously refutes the idea that the shah was as an irresponsible leader whose\nextravagant weapons purchases needed to be curtailed: \u201cIran\u2019s economic growth\nwas not slowed nor was its political cohesion affected by its defense spending.\u201d\nFar from being a dangerous upstart, Kissinger thought of the shah as statesman\nwho, \u201cIn his grasp of the international trends and currents . . . was among the\nmost impressive leaders that I met. He had a sure grasp of the importance of\nboth the global and the regional balance of power.\u201d149 Both men were cold\nwarriors who firmly believed that containing the Soviet Union \u201crequired the\ntolerance of brutality as a bulwark against worse suffering.\u201d150 The pro-Western\nPahlavi monarchy was a perfect fit in such a strategy of containment. The shah\nwas conscious of the importance of this new American thinking, and as the\ndocumentary record suggests, he consistently used the language of the Nixon\nDoctrine to advocate a policy of Iranian primacy in the Persian Gulf. He later\nwrote that Kissinger\u2019s \u201cgeo-political ideas coincided perfectly with mine.\u201d151 His\n148.

Alone among the countries of the region\u2014Israel aside\u2014Iran made\nfriendship with the United States the starting point of its foreign policy. That\nit was based on a cold-eyed assessment that a threat to Iran would most likely\ncome from the Soviet Union, in combination with radical Arab states, is\nonly another way of saying that the Shah\u2019s views of the realities of the world\nparalleled our own. Iran\u2019s influence was always on our side . . . The Shah\nabsorbed the energies of radical Arab neighbors to prevent them from\nthreatening the moderate regimes in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and the Persian\nGulf.153\nimplementing the nixon doctrine\nIn the year that followed the adoption of NSDM 92 in November 1970, the\nshah took two steps that confirmed Washington\u2019s assessment of the preponder-\nance of Iranian power in the Persian Gulf. First, in the landmark Tehran\nAgreement of February 14, 1971, between the international oil companies and\nthe oil-producing countries of the Gulf, the shah cajoled the companies into\nincreasing the producers\u2019 share of oil profits and raising the price of oil.154 Then\non November 30, 1971, just a day before Britain\u2019s defense treaty obligations to\nthe Arab rulers of the Lower Gulf expired, the shah deployed Iranian troops on\nthe Gulf islands of Abu Musa and the Tunbs, which were claimed by both Iran\nand the British protected states of Sharjah and Ras al-Khaimah.155 London could\nprotect neither British Petroleum nor its Arab clients in the Gulf from the shah.\nBoth actions demonstrated that Iran, with the full support of the United States,\nhad taken Britain\u2019s place as the principal power in the region.\nAs the mantle of regional primacy passed from Britain to Iran, the shah\nwould play an increasingly active role in the Nixon Doctrine, beginning with\nthe 1971 South Asian crisis. The crisis was sparked when the martial law\nregime of Gen. Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan, who had come to power in\nPakistan in a military coup in March 1969, held national and provincial elec-\ntions in both East and West Pakistan in December 1970 in order to transfer\npower to civilian hands. In elections for the federal National Assembly, the\nAwami League, led by Sheikh Mujib al-Rahman and representing the Bengalis\n152.

Negotiations between\nthe Awami League and the PPP to form a government failed, and when the\nPakistani army attempted to impose a military solution in late March, a civil\nwar erupted. The Awami League declared East Pakistan\u2019s secession as the\nindependent state of Bangladesh while the Pakistani army pursued a brutal\ncrackdown on the Bengali separatists, creating a massive flow of refugees into\nIndia. The civil war became an Indo-Pakistan war on November 21, 1971,\nwhen the Indian military intervened on the side of Bangladesh, leading to the\nsurrender of Pakistan on December 16.156\nThroughout the crisis, Nixon wanted to help Pakistan, which was not only\naligned with the United States, but also a friend of Communist China, with\nwhich the United States was secretly cultivating a d\u00e9tente. Furthermore, Paki-\nstan was pitted against India, which had signed a treaty of friendship with the\nSoviet Union in August 1971. The tide of American opinion was against Paki-\nstan because of the massacres of Bengali civilians. Consequently American\nmilitary transfers to Pakistan were suspended by the State Department in April,\nand economic aid was halted in July. Initially, Nixon and Kissinger limited their\nefforts to preventing the United States from aiding India, over the strong\nobjections of a State Department that had been left in the dark about the\nopening to China.157 It was in this context that the shah played a secret role in\nproviding American arms from Iran\u2019s own inventories to Pakistan.\nPakistan was Iran\u2019s CENTO ally, and the shah had already intervened once\nin 1965 to support Pakistan against India. With the outbreak of the 1971 crisis\nthe shah worried that if Pakistan were not given assistance Yahya would increas-\ningly turn to Beijing, extending Communist influence along Iran\u2019s borders.\nForeign Minister Zahedi described such an eventuality as a \u201cdisaster for Iran.\u201d158\nMoreover, the shah\u2019s greatest fear was that an Indian victory in East Pakistan\nmight also lead to the collapse of West Pakistan. This was a nightmare scenario\nfor Iran, given the Baluchi separatist movement along the Iranian-Pakistani\nborder regions.159 The shah had quietly taken a number of steps throughout\n1971 to defuse tensions and encourage a negotiated solution. In April, he had\nadvised the Pakistani ambassador in Tehran that it was futile to try and use force\n156. See Richard Sisson and Leo E.

According to American intelligence sources, the shah\u2019s response was\n\u201creserved,\u201d agreeing only to \u201cprovide some limited military material\u201d and his\ngood offices for resolving the crisis, but refusing to join Pakistan in any war with\nIndia.162\nIn October the shah hosted a lavish celebration for the 2,500-year anniver-\nsary of the founding of the Persian Empire at the ancient Achaemenid capital of\nPersepolis. He tried to use the occasion to mediate the South Asian crisis by\narranging a meeting between Indian President V. V. Giri, Soviet leader Nikolai\nPodgorny, and Yahya, all of whom were attending the celebration. Nothing\nemerged from the Persepolis meeting other than a quiet Soviet warning to the\nshah not to provide military assistance to Pakistan.163 After his mediation efforts\nhad come to naught and with India\u2019s military intervention in late November, the\nshah began working with the Nixon administration to secretly support Pakistan.\nFollowing an urgent appeal for help from Yahya on December 4, 1971, Nixon\ndecided to covertly provide assistance to Pakistan via Iran. This way, the presi-\ndent told Kissinger that morning, \u201cIf it is leaking we can have it denied. Have it\ndone one step away.\u201d164 The need for secrecy stemmed from the problem that\nsuch third-party transfers of U.S. arms were illegal, \u201cunless the United States\nitself would transfer the defense article under consideration to that country.\u201d165\nKissinger\u2019s staff advised him that, \u201cThe President could, of course, give his\nconsent to third-party transfers if he were also willing to establish, as a matter of\npolicy, our willingness to supply the same items directly.\u201d166 But given the\npopular mood against Pakistan among the public and in Congress, Nixon was\n160.

In the first\nmeeting of the visit on the afternoon of May 30, Nixon thanked the shah for the\nrole Iran had played in supporting Pakistan. He briefed the shah on his discus-\nsions with Brezhnev and asked if America\u2019s allies had anything to fear from\nU.S.-Soviet d\u00e9tente, implying that d\u00e9tente did not mean a weakening of\nAmerica\u2019s commitment to Iran. The shah replied, \u201cNot if you have the right\nallies . . . If they are self-reliant they will welcome it. If they have the principle\nof fighting until the last American they will not welcome it.\u201d Clearly alluding to\nthe Nixon Doctrine, the shah emphasized that \u201cIran, like Israel, must be able to\nstand alone.\u201d171 The following morning, the shah finally received the American\n167.

In his minute\nof the May 31 meeting, Kissinger recorded that Nixon, \u201casked the shah to\nunderstand the purpose of American policy. \u2018Protect me,\u2019 he said. \u2018Don\u2019t look at\nd\u00e9tente as something that weakens you but as a way for the United States to gain\ninfluence.\u2019 The Nixon Doctrine was a way for the United States to build a new\nlong-term policy on [the] support of allies.\u201d172 Nixon\u2019s choice of words was\nextraordinary. The president of the United States had traveled to the court of\nthe shah of Iran to ask Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to protect him. In addition to\na commitment to support Iran\u2019s secret war in Iraqi Kurdistan, Nixon also\nassured the shah that his administration would authorize the sale of advanced\nF-14 and F-15 fighter jets to Iran as well as laser-guided bombs.173 The shah\nrightly boasted to Alam that Nixon \u201cgave me everything I asked for.\u201d174\nThe Tehran summit was, as Harold Saunders later recalled, the \u201ccapstone\nevent\u201d in the shift in U.S. Persian Gulf policy from balancing to Iranian primacy.\nThe turning point had come with NSDM 92 in November 1970. A year and a\nhalf later, Nixon had made commitments to the shah in Tehran that were, in\nSaunders\u2019 words, \u201ca ratification of a posture that had long since crystallized.\u201d175\nBut after returning to Washington from Tehran, Kissinger found that Nixon\u2019s\npolicy of Iranian primacy was encountering resistance in the American bureau-\ncracy, particularly in the Pentagon, where many officials objected to giving the\nshah a blank check on conventional arms sales to Iran. Kissinger was compelled\nto write to both Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird and Secretary of State\nWilliam Rogers in July, to remind them that \u201cdecisions on the acquisition of\nmilitary equipment should be left primarily to the government of Iran.\u201d176 At the\ntime of the 1972 Tehran meeting, Iran\u2019s military expenditure was already three\ntimes that of Iraq and nearly twice that of Saudi Arabia.177 During Nixon\u2019s\npresidency, annual U.S. military sales to Iran would grow more than sevenfold,\nfrom $94.9 million in 1969 to $682.8 million in 1974. They would go on to\nreach a peak of more than $2.55 billion in 1977.178 This burgeoning military\nspending would give Iran a position of largely uncontested power in the Gulf.\nFar from being an \u201cAnglo-American lake,\u201d for a decade the Gulf was a region\nwhere Iranian power was profoundly felt.179 In Iraq, the shah used the Kurdish\nrebellion against Baghdad to pressure Saddam Hussein into settling the dispute\n172.

Never before, nor ever since, did the\nshah enjoy such access and influence in the White House. The shah convinced\nNixon to break with Johnson\u2019s policy of balancing Iran and Saudi Arabia as the\n\u201ctwin pillars\u201d of the Persian Gulf and instead embrace Iran\u2019s primacy in the wake\nof the British withdrawal from East of Suez. Some have argued that \u201cthe Nixon\nDoctrine, as implemented in the Persian Gulf, was actually little more than an\nIranian policy eagerly embraced by an administration caught in the morass of\nthe Vietnam War.\u201d182 But the Vietnam quagmire tells us very little about the\nchoices Nixon made in the Gulf. It was certainly the case that the United States,\nconsumed by the war in Indochina, could not take on the role that Britain had\nabandoned in the Gulf. Like his predecessor, President Nixon looked to local\nactors to fill the vacuum left by the British. But his decision to back Iranian\nprimacy was not the obvious choice that Henry Kissinger has made it out to be.\nNixon could have continued with Johnson\u2019s twin pillars policy. Instead, he tilted\ntoward Iran as the principal power of the region. American perceptions of Soviet\ninfluence in Iraq and instability in Saudi Arabia both played their part in the\norigins of Nixon\u2019s Gulf policy. But the crucial factor was that under Nixon, the\nshah\u2019s ambitions were seen by the White House as an asset rather than a liability.\nNixon did not share the view of his predecessors or the naysayers in the\nPentagon that the shah\u2019s military spending needed to be curtailed. Instead, he\nsaw his old friend Mohammad Reza Pahlavi as a strong, modernizing, anti-\nCommunist statesman, and was happy to provide Iran with whatever arms the\nshah ordered. With a raft of more pressing international issues on their agenda,\nNixon and Kissinger deferred to the shah\u2019s judgment on Gulf matters, just as\ntheir predecessors had relied on the British. Instead of containing a rising Iran,\nNixon embraced it. Instead of curtailing the shah\u2019s military spending, he\nordered his administration not to second guess the shah.\nLess than seven years after Nixon\u2019s momentous 1972 visit to Tehran, the shah\nwas overthrown in a popular revolution, and U.S. Persian Gulf policy lay in\nruins. In the shadow of the subsequent Tehran hostage crisis, some were quick\n180.

The shah\u2019s growing leverage over the United States was\nalready apparent under Nixon\u2019s predecessors.184 It is difficult to imagine that\nNixon would have had any more success in constraining the shah in the 1970s\nthan President Kennedy\u2019s \u201cNew Frontiersmen\u201d had in pushing the shah to\nreform a decade earlier.185 Instead, we must reexamine the popular myth of the\nshah as a pliant Third World client of the United States during the global Cold\nWar.
