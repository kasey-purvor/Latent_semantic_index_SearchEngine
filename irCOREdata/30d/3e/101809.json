INTRODUCTION \n Nanostructured materials have received tremendous interest \nover the recent years due to their unique properties. In \nparticular, one-dimensional structures such as nanotubes and \nnanowires are intensely investigated. Metal oxides belong to a \nfamily of materials that has various distinctive electrochromic, \noptochromic and gaschromic properties which enable \napplications such as sensors, smart coatings, etc [1-6]. \nTungsten oxide have interesting properties such as n-type \nsemiconductor, photocatalytic, etc. Tungsten oxide in \nnanostructured form can lead to the appearance of interesting \nproperties, such as photoluminescence [7].  \nRecently, the synthesis of one dimensional tungsten oxide \nstructures have been reported [8-12]. The synthesis technique \ntypically involves simple vaporization of a tungsten source or \nheating of tungsten substrates or filaments in an oxidizing \nambient. In this work, tungsten oxide nanowires are shown to \nbe synthesized using simple thermal annealing in nitrogen \nambient. The oxygen source is found to come mostly from the \nnative oxide on the tungsten surface. This method allows for \nthe direct synthesis of the nanowires on the substrate and is \ndifferent from the more common Vapor-Liquid-Solid (VLS) \ngrowth mechanism for nanowire or nanotube synthesis as no \ncatalyst is used. It is also shown that the yield of such structure \ncan be significantly increased with the addition of acetylene, \nwhich plays a critical part in the nucleation of the nanowire. A \npossible nucleation mechanism involving the role of the \nacetylene was proposed.  \nII. EXPERIMENTAL \nA vacuum chamber equipped with a heated stage is \nused for the synthesis of the tungsten oxide nanowires. The \nheater stage is capable of providing uniform heating for a 3\u201d \nwafer, reaching temperatures as high as 750\u00b0C. The system \nhas a base pressure of 10-3 torr and the process pressure is \ncontrollable using a valve. Pre-cleaned tungsten wires and \npolished polycrystalline tungsten plates are used in the \ninvestigation. The samples are cleaned by ultrasonicating in \nacetone, follow by DI water. The pre-clean was found to be \nessential in the synthesis of tungsten oxide nanowires. Un-\ntreated tungsten wires typically resulted in low or no yield. A \ntypical synthesis process would involve heating the sample on \nthe stage to 650\u00b0C in 5 torr of nitrogen atmosphere. Acetylene \nwould be introduced into the process chamber and the \nsynthesis would be carried out for 30 mins. The sample is \ntaken out of the chamber after being cooled to below 50\u00b0C in \nnitrogen ambient. The empirical observation of the \nmorphology and microstructure of the tungsten oxide \nnanowires were conducted using a FEI Quanta 200 \nEnvironmental Scanning Electron microscope (ESEM) and \nPhilips CM200 high resolution transmission electron \nmicroscope (HRTEM). The HRTEM is operated at 200 kV \nwith a LaB6 filament and has a line resolution of 0.14nm.  \nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nTungsten oxide nanowires are grown at various acetylene \nconcentrations (diluted in nitrogen), ranging from 0% to 20%. \nWith the addition of acetylene, the yield can be dramatically \nimproved. Fig . 1 shows the SEM images of the synthesis as a \nfunction of acetylene concentration. It was found that, \nalthough nanowire structures can be synthesized by simple \nannealing in nitrogen ambient (Fig 1a and e), the yield is \ngenerally low. At low concentrations of acetylene (Fig. 1b and \nf), nanowire growth can be found to literally cover all the \nobservable surface of the tungsten wire. Optimal growth was \nobserved for acetylene concentration between 3% and 6%. As \nshown in Fig. 1c and g, at 10% acetylene concentration, the \nyield starts to decrease. Above 10%, the yield drops back to a \ncomparable level as for the synthesis carried out in only \nnitrogen ambient. At all acetylene concentrations, there were \nno significant observable changes in the diameter of the \n0-7803-9358-9\/06\/$20.00  \u00a9 2006 IEEE 376\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

SEM images of tungsten oxide nanowires synthesized on tungsten wire\nwith (a) 0%, (b) 3%, (c) 10% and (d) 20% acetylene concentration at 650\u00b0C. \nCorresponding higher magnification SEM images are shown in (e-h).\nFig. 2a shows the SEM image of the nanowire synthesis on\npolycrystalline tungsten plates when a small amount of air is \nleaked into the chamber (giving an estimated oxygen partial\npressure of ~ 2 x 10-2 Torr). The synthesis is carried out at\n650\u00b0C and 5 Torr of process pressure. Fig. 2b shows a similar\ngrowth process, but with 3% acetylene in nitrogen, and no air\nleakage. It was found that the nanowire yield synthesis is high\nfor both conditions. However, as can be seen from the SEM\nimages, the nanowires synthesized with air leakage are much\nlarger in diameter as compared to those synthesized with \nacetylene.\nFig. 2: SEM images of nanowire growth on polycrystalline tungsten plate (a)\nwith air leakage and (b) with acetylene.\nIt was also observed that the nanowires synthesized with air\nleakage are much longer than those synthesized with acetylene.\nA series of growth experiments with acetylene was carried out\nfor different growth times. An extended growth duration was\nnot found to increase neither the yield, nor length of the\nnanowires.\nThe HRTEM images of the nanowires grown with acetylene\nare shown in Fig. 3. The nanowires are collected on holey\ncarbon grid by ultrasonically treating the sample in \nisopropanol, and then filtering the solution through the grid.\nThe TEM images show that the nanowires are crystalline, with\nthe fringes clearly highlighted. The inter-lattice distance is \nfound to be 3.7\u00c5. The nanowire core, which is very uniform\nalong the entire length, is around 13 nm and terminates with a\nflat end. \nFig. 3. TEM images of the nanowire (a) body and (b) tip.\nThe TEM also clearly shows that the nanowire is covered\nwith an amorphous coating. It should be noted that, even when\nno acetylene is used, an amorphous coating around the\nnanowires can be found. Energy Dispersive X-Ray (EDX) and\nX-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) both confirm that\nthe sample consists of tungsten, oxygen and carbon (not\nshown). From these techniques, it is also found that the \ntungsten is predominately tungsten trioxide, WO3. Energy-\nfiltered TEM imaging was performed to reveal the spatial\ndistribution of carbon and oxygen.\n377\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on March 23,2010 at 06:04:41 EDT from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nFig. 4. shows the elemental mapping of carbon and oxygen\nfrom the energy-filtered TEM. From the elemental mapping\nand the HRTEM images, the amorphous coating around the\nnanowire is found to be carbon and around 0.7 nm thick.\nFig. 4: Energy Filtered TEM image showing (a) carbon and (b) Oxygen\nmapping of the tungsten oxide nanowire.\nIt is not clear from the energy filtered TEM images whether\nthe carbon has been incorporated into the structure. However,\nXPS has not revealed any presence of tungsten carbide.\nFrom the SEM and TEM results, several important\nobservations can be gathered. Firstly, when there is no\ndeliberate introduction of oxygen, the tungsten oxide\nnanowires can still be synthesized. Secondly, increasing the\nsynthesis duration did not result in a similar increase in the\nlength of the nanowires. These two observations suggest that\nthe source of oxygen is probably coming from the native oxide\non the surface. At room temperature, the exposure of tungsten \nto molecular oxygen results in dissociative chemisorption,\nwith oxygen atoms sitting at triply-coordinated sites [13]. It is \nlikely that some similarly chemisorbed oxygen is present on\nthe tungsten surface after prolonged exposure to atmosphere\nand the ultrasonic treatment in DI water. It was reported that\nsurface oxygen on tungsten remains largely unchanged up to \n970K, with even 10% oxygen still remaining up to 1670K [14].\nTherefore the nanowires are forming with most of the oxygen\npresent on the tungsten surface and this is probably the\nlimiting factor for the length of the nanowire.\nThe role of the acetylene however is much more interesting. \nThe introduction of acetylene significantly increases the\nnucleation of the nanowires. The HRTEM and energy filtered\nTEM images present no concrete evidence to suggest that\ncarbon is incorporated in the nanowire. XPS has also not \ndetected any formation of tungsten carbide. Assuming that the\ncarbon does not play any part in the formation of the nanowire,\nthis leads to the question of whether the carbon plays any role\nin the nucleation of the nanowire.\nWe propose that the tungsten oxide nanowire are formed via\na stress driven mechanism. Acetylene begins to dissociate at \n600\u00b0C, giving different reactive species. Carbon and hydrogen\nare both reducing agents. The tungsten surface oxide would be\nreduced initially at numerous locations, possibly at grain\nboundaries. The diffusion of carbon at the grain boundaries\ncreates lattice faults, which act as dislocation sources from\nwhich the tungsten oxide nanowire can grow. This generates a\nstress field which pushes the tungsten oxide nanowire\nformation from the base. This is supported by the observation\nof uniform diameter along the whole length of the nanowire.\nThe orientation of the nanowire formation would depend on\nthe direction of the stress field, which would also be related to\nthe grain boundaries. This is evident from Fig. 1f where the\ngrowth of the nanowires is clearly following the elongated \ngrains of the tungsten wire. The growth rate of the nanowire\nwould then be limited by the strain generated and the diffusion\nmechanism.\nThe introduction of the acetylene helps to improve the \nnucleation density of the nanowires but a high concentration\nof acetylene would result in excessive carbon coating. This\nwould then inhibit the nucleation. The introduction of air into\nthe system has shown to result in larger and longer nanowires\nand could be following a Vapor-Solid (VS) growth\nmechanism. This is expected to be different from the above\nprocess just described. The introduction of H2O vapor could\nhave similar reduction effect, although how that actually\npromotes the formation of the nanowires is still under\ninvestigation.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nHere, we report on the formation of crystalline tungsten\noxide nanowires using a simple thermal annealing process.\nThe nucleation of these nanowires can be increased with the\naddition of acetylene. We proposed a new nucleation \nmechanism, based on the selective reduction along the grain \nboundaries and on the generation of stress fields from the\ncarbon diffusion. This would allow tungsten oxide nanowires\nto be grown at relatively low temperatures, with high yield. \nV. REFERENCES\n[1] H. Qiu, Y.F. Lu and Z.H. Mai, J. Appl Phys. 91, 440 (2001)\n[2] Y.
