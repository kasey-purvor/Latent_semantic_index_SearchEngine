INTRODUCTION\nWind power is the fastest growing renewable energy resource and wind power penetration in power systems increases at a \nsignificant rate as [1] demonstrates. \nThe high penetration of wind power into power systems in the present and near future will have several impacts on their \nplanning and operation. One of these impacts the effect of wind power on power systems reliability, emphasized because wind \npower is intermittent. So the reliability of the wind turbines (WT) delivering this power will become an essential consideration \n* Manuscript\nClick here to view linked References\nover the next few years. Due to the competitive environment of the power generation industry developers and operators prefer \nthe most economically productive WT configurations. Long-term cost-analysis of WTs, including their first investment and \noperation & maintenance (O&M) costs, will result in better WT configuration choices. This is only possible if such analysis \nincludes the reliability of the different WT technologies.\nThe reliability of WTs as part of a large power system have been assessed in a number of references [2]-[5]. Such studies \nconsider the wind as a stochastic process, using an appropriate time series to model the wind, and combining it with the power-\nspeed curve of the WT.\nThere have been few studies of the reliability of WTs as isolated systems rather than as part of a large power system [6]. This \npaper focuses on the reliability analysis in design stage of a WT as a single, complex system, consisting of several mechanical, \nelectrical and auxiliary assemblies. \nThe reliability analysis methods used in the design stage of power generation systems are qualitative, depending on comparison \nwith data from similar systems, whereas after several years power generation O& reliability analysis can become more \nquantitative, depending on field statistical data. \nFailure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), the best candidate for reliability analysis at the design stage, is well defined and \nhas been used for many power generation engineering systems. There is no published record of an FMEA applied to a WT, \nalthough the method may have been used individually by WT assembly manufacturers.\nThe main objective of this paper will be to carry out a comprehensive FMEA on a complete 2 MW, variable speed, geared drive\nWT, considering all the major assemblies and the effects of their failure on the overall turbine performance, to demonstrate the \napplicability of this technique to WT systems.\nThe first objective of the work is to provide WT designers a modus operandi for the application of FMEA techniques to their \nproduct and to provide feedback for WT design improvements and the optimization of wind farm O&M. \nA second objective will be to investigate the relationship between quantitative FMEA results and WT field assembly failure \nrates.\nA third objective will be to examine how the method deals with a significant proposed design change to the WT.\nThe paper is arranged as follows:\nSection two reviews the FMEA method and its components. The procedure which is used for WT in this paper is based on a \nstandard FMEA with some amendments introduced in this section.\nSection three describes the WT itself, including different types and configurations. The WT assembly subdivision considered for \nthe FMEA is described in section four, together with the 2 MW, variable speed, geared drive WT configuration, incorporating a \nDoubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG), to be analyzed in the paper.\nSection five shows FMEA procedure for this WT, including Root Causes and Failure Modes considered and assigning\nquantitative values to them.\nSection six introduces three specific purpose software tools for the FMEA and describes the facilities of the selected software \ntool. The procedure of WT FMEA in the software is explained in section seven.   \nSection seven shows the quantitative results of the FMEA and compares it with reliability field data from similar size turbines to \nfind a relationship between them. \nSection nine considers the effect on the WT FMEA of incorporating a Brushless Doubly Fed Generator (BDFG) is considered in \nfor comparison with the main configuration of a DFIG.\nSection ten reviews the more frequently occurring failure modes and root causes in the WT FMEA.\nSection eleven presents the conclusions and recommendations.\n2. FAILURE MODE AND EFFECT ANALYSIS\nThe FMEA is a powerful design tool that provides a mean to compare, from a risk point of view, alternative machine system \nconfigurations. The FMEA is also useful for considering designs improvements for a technology which is changing or \nincreasing in rating, as WT configurations are.\nThe FMEA is a formalized but subjective analysis for the systematic identification of possible Root Causes and Failure Modes \nand the estimation of their relative risks. The main goal is to identify and then limit or avoid risk within a design. \nHence the FMEA drives towards higher reliability, higher quality, and enhanced safety. It can also be used to assess and \noptimize maintenance plans. \nAn FMEA is usually carried out by a team consisting of design and maintenance personnel whose experience includes all the \nfactors to be considered in the analysis.\nThe causes of failure are said to be Root Causes, and may be defined as mechanisms that lead to the occurrence of a failure. \nWhile the term failure has been defined, it does not describe the mechanism by which the component has failed. Failure Modes\nare the different ways in which a component may fail. It is vitally important to realize that a Failure Mode is not the cause of a \nfailure, but the way in which a failure has occurred. The effects of one failure can frequently be linked to the Root Causes of \nanother failure.\nThe FMEA procedure assigns a numerical value to each risk associated with causing a failure, using Severity, Occurrence and \nDetection as metrics. As the risk increases, the values of the ranking rise. These are then combined into a risk priority number \n(RPN), which can be used to analyze the system. By targeting high value RPNs the most risky elements of the design can be \naddressed. RPN is calculated by multiplying the Severity by the Occurrence by the Detection of the risk.\nSeverity refers to the magnitude of the End Effect of a system failure. The more severe the consequence, the higher the value of \nseverity will be assigned to the effect. \nOccurrence refers to the frequency that a Root Cause is likely to occur, described in a qualitative way. That is not in the form of \na period of time but rather in terms such as remote or occasional. \nDetection refers to the likelihood of detecting a Root Cause before a failure can occur.\nSince FMEA is used by various industries, including Automotive; Aeronautical; Military; Nuclear and Electro-technical, \nspecific standards have been developed for its application. A typical standard will outlines Severity, Occurrence and Detection \nrating scales as well as examples of an FMEA spreadsheet layout. Also a glossary will be included that defines all the terms \nused in the FMEA. The rating scales and the layout of the data can differ between standards, but the processes and definitions \nremain similar.\nSAE J 1739 was developed as an automotive design tool, SMC REGULATION 800-31 was developed for aerospace but the \nmost widely used standard is MIL-STD-1629A (1980), drafted by The United States Department of Defense [7]. With over 30 \nyears usage and development, it has been employed in many different industries for general failure analysis. Due to the \ncomplexity and criticality of military systems, it provides a reliable foundation on which to perform FMEAs on a variety of \nsystems. It also contains formulae for predicting the failure rates of electrical and electronic systems, whose coefficients are \nbased on accelerated life tests.\nThe Severity, Occurrence and Detection factors are individually rated using a numerical scale, typically ranging from 1 to 10. \nThese scales, however, can vary in range depending on the FMEA standard being applied. However, for all standards, a high \nvalue represents a poor score (for example catastrophically severe, very regular occurrence or impossible to detect). Once a \nstandard is selected it must be used throughout the FMEA.\nIn this paper [7] was used but with some amendment, principally to change the Severity, Occurrence and Detection criteria by \nwhich the RPN is calculated. These modifications were necessary to make the FMEA methodology more appropriate to WT\nsystems.\nThe modified Severity scale and criteria are shown in Table 1. The original scale of 1-4 was maintained but changes were made \nto the category criteria definitions to emphasis their implications for a WT.\nTable 1\nSeverity rating scale for WT FMEA\nScale # Description Criteria\n1 Category IV(Minor) Electricity can be generated but urgent repair is required.\n2 Category III(Marginal) Reduction in ability to generate electricity.\n3 Category II(Critical) Loss of ability to generate electricity.\n4 Category I(Catastrophic) Major damage to the Turbine as a capital installation.\nThe modified Occurrence scale and criteria are tabulated in Table 2.\nTable 2\nOccurrence rating scale for WT FMEA\nScale# Description Criteria\n1 Level E(Extremely Unlikely) A single Failure Mode probability of occurrence is less than 0.001.\n2 Level D  (Remote) A single Failure Mode probability of occurrence is more than 0.001 but less than 0.01\n3 Level C(Occasional) A single Failure Mode probability of occurrence is more than 0.01 but less than 0.10.\n5 Level A  (Frequent) A single Failure Mode probability greater than 0.10.\nThe Level B of standard [7]was removed as the presence of Level A and C were considered adequate for the WT as it was \noriginally difficult to make a clear distinction between Levels A, B and C.\nThe number of Detection levels were reduced by removing 2, 3, 5, 6 and 8 as the presence of the remaining four levels was \nadequate for this analysis. The modified Detection scale and criteria are tabulated in Table 3.\nTable 3\nDetection rating scale for WT FMEA\nScale# Description Criteria\n1 Almost certain Current monitoring methods almost always will detect the failure.\n4 High Good likelihood current monitoring methods will detect the failure.\n7 Low Low likelihood current monitoring methods will detect the failure.\n10 Almost impossible No known monitoring methods available to detect the failure.\nIt can be concluded that the minimum RPN for any Root Cause is 1 and the maximum is 200. As long as the rating scales of a \nselected FMEA procedure remain fixed, it can be used for the comparison of alternative designs and identification of critical \nassemblies. \nDefining these three criteria tables based on MIL-STD-1629A standard [7] is the first step in performing an FMEA. As \nmentioned before the basic principles of an FMEA using different standards are similar and simple;\n\uf0b7 The system to be studied must be broken down into its assemblies\n\uf0b7 Then for each assembly all possible Failure Modes must be determined\n\uf0b7 The Root Causes of each Failure Mode must be determined for each assembly.\n\uf0b7 The End Effects of each Failure Modes must be assigned a level of Severity, and every Root Cause must be assigned a \nlevel of Occurrence and Detection\n\uf0b7 Levels of Severity, Occurrence and Detection are multiplied to produce the RPN\nTherefore the first stage in the FMEA procedure is obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the WT system and its main \nassemblies.  \n3. WT SYSTEMS\nWTs can be categorized in two main configurations, fixed and variable speed. Early fixed speed WTs, produced until the late \n1990s with the ratings below 1 MW, used a multistage gearbox and a standard squirrel-cage induction generator, directly \nconnected to the grid. Some improvements were made and termed semi-variable speed systems as follows:\n\uf0b7 Using two distinct stator windings with different pole numbers giving a two speed system;\n\uf0b7 Using a wound rotor induction generator with external resistors connected via brush and slip rings;\n\uf0b7 Or using the patented OptiSlip\u00ae system.\nFrom the late 1990s new fully variable speed WTs were introduced in wind power industry from approximately 1 MW. The \nneed to change to variable speed WTs was the result of shortcomings of the fixed speed system, as follows:\n\uf0b7 Low energy yield [8];\n\uf0b7 Significant audible noise;\n\uf0b7 Difficulty in stopping WTs under emergency conditions using only mechanical or air brakes;\n\uf0b7 Poor power quality.\nThe first generation of fully variable speed WT systems used a multistage gearbox, a relatively low-cost standard wound rotor \ninduction generator as a DFIG and a power electronic converter feeding the DFIG rotor with a rating approximately 30% of the \nrating of the turbine.\nSince 1991, there have also been variable speed WT systems using gearless generator systems, so-called direct-drive generators, \ndesigned to eliminate gearbox failures, a fully-rated power electronic converter is then necessary for the grid connection [8].\nHowever, the DFIG geared technology is currently the most widely used in the industry because of its low capital cost and good \nenergy yield [9].\nThe new technology of the Brushless Doubly Fed Generator (BDFG) has been claimed as the next generation to the DFIG in the \nWT as it eliminates the need for brushes and slip rings but it is in the first stage of feasibility study for large rating WTs [10].\n4. R80 WT SYSTEM CONSIDERED IN THIS PAPER\nThis paper focuses on a WT incorporating either a DFIG or BDFG which will be a 2 MW, 80m diameter, named in \nRELIAWIND [11] as R80, a reference configuration for the indirect drive concept, with a variable speed system and active \nblade pitch control.  The gearbox used in the R80 has three stages consisting of one planetary and two parallel stages.\nTo achieve consistency in the FMEA it is essential to consider the level of detail needed for a true representation of the system \nwithout complicating the analysis. If, the system is broken down to individual components it would become complex, requiring\ndetailed system knowledge. For WTs, where many different configurations and designs are similar, with complex assemblies \nlacking of accessible detail on all components, it is acceptable to carry out the FMEA down to assembly level, for example to \nthe lubrication oil system of the gearbox rather than to individual pumps, pipes and valves.\nIn this paper eleven main assemblies are considered for the R80 FMEA study. Table 4 shows the assemblies considered in this \npaper, based on [12]. It is evident that not all of these assemblies may be available in some types of WTs.\nTable 4\nR80 WT subdivision\nWT Assemblies\nRotor and Blades Assembly\nMechanical Brake\nMain Shaft\nGearbox\nGenerator\nYaw System\nPitch Control System\nHydraulics\nGrid and Electrical system\nElectrical Controls  \nTower, Foundation and Nacelle\nAn intermediate level of detail was also chosen, as shown in Figure 1, with the Wind Turbine being analyzed to Levels 3 & 4 \nwhere possible. \nFig. 1. WT construction hierarchy for FMEA\nAs an example the subassemblies which are considered for the Generator (DFIG) are shown in Table 5. The power electronic \nconverter, considered in some literature as a subassembly of DFIG, is considered in the separate Electrical Controls assembly\nhere.\nTable 5\nR80 Generator subassemblies\nGenerator (DFIG) Subassemblies\nEnclosure System\nVentilation System\nStator\nRotor\nInstrumentation\nParts considered for Enclosure subassembly of the Generator assembly, are tabulated in Table 6. The similar procedure was \nconducted for other assemblies. \nTable 6\nR80 Generator Enclosure system parts\nEnclosure System Parts\nFrame \nDrive End Bearing\nNon Drive End Bearing\nBearing Lubrication System\nShaft\nMain Terminal Box\nThis 11 assembly WT has a total of 40 subassemblies and 107 parts. This level of subdivision was based on the data available\nabout the reliability of different parts of the WT at the start of the analyses. \nThe final step in this paper will be to replace the DFIG in the R80 with an equivalent Brushless Doubly Fed Generator (BDFG) \nto compare the two configurations; at that stage some amendment will also be necessary in the gearbox assembly.\n5. WT FMEA PROCEDURE\nAfter subdivision of the selected WT system the probable Failure Modes are generated. The expected Failure Modes were \nconsidered for all 107 parts in the R80 and many were found to be common between various parts. Table 7 shows the 16 \ncommon Failure Modes for the R80 WT identified in three related columns. \nTable 7\nR80 WT Failure Modes\nMechanical Electrical Material\nMechanical Electrical Insulation Material\nRupture Electrical Failure Fatigue\nUprooting Output Inaccuracy Structural\nFracture Software Fault\nDetachment Intermittent Output\nThermal\nBlockage\nMisalignment\nFollowing identification of part Failure Modes, the expected Root Causes must also be found. As with the Failure Mode\nanalysis, the expected Root Causes for the WT will be a limited set, and in this study Table 8 shows 25 common Root Causes\nidentified in three related columns.\nTable 8\nR80 WT Root Causes\nStructural Wear Electrical\nDesign Fault Corrosion Calibration Error\nExternal Damage Excessive Brush Wear Connection failure\nInstallation Defect Fatigue Electrical Overload\nMaintenance Fault Pipe Puncture Electrical Short\nManufacturing Defect Vibration Fatigue Insulation failure\nMechanical Overload Overheating Lightning Strike\nMechanical Overload-collision Insufficient Lubrication Loss of Power Input\nMechanical Overload-wind Conducting Debris\nPresence of Debris Software Design Fault\nOne of the drawbacks of field failure data available from WT systems [12] is that Failure Modes and Root Causes for particular \nfailures are not usually recorded. The FMEA has the ability to relate each Failure Mode to its Root Causes and then calculate the \nfrequency of occurrence for each Root Cause so there could be some advantage in combining measured failure rate data with the \nFMEA procedure.  \nWhen completing the list of Failure Modes and their Root Causes, the effects of these parts\u2019 Failure Modes on related \nsubassemblies must be considered.  Although similar to Root Cause consideration, several effects could be considered for each \nFailure Mode but here only the main effect of each part Failure Mode is taken into account. \nIn an FMEA the main Failure Modes are those related to parts in the system hierarchy, which in this case are the 16 Failure \nModes presented in Table 7. The effects of parts\u2019 Failure Modes will be the Failure Modes of their related subassembly and the \neffects of subassembly Failure Modes will be the assembly Failure Modes \nThe last steps in the FMEA are:\n\uf0b7 Adjusting the severity of each Failure Mode to an appropriate level due to its effect. \n\uf0b7 Assigning occurrence and detection figures for the related Root Causes. \nUse of Tables 7-8 and engineering judgment are the bases for this procedure.  \nFor each Failure Mode with several Root Causes, multiplying the occurrence and detection values for each Root Cause by the \nFailure Mode severity results in related root cause RPN. Summating these Root Cause RPNs then gives the selected Failure \nMode RPN. Aggregating the part Failure Mode RPNs builds the part RPN. \nAggregating the part RPNs builds the subassembly RPN. \nAggregating the subassembly RPNs builds the assembly RPN.\nTherefore an FMEA can be completed by subdividing a WT down to its part level, considering Failure Modes, Root Causes and \nFailure Mode effects, expanding the Failure Modes effects at each level into Failure Modes at a higher level, then continuing \nthis procedure until all levels of the WT have been considered. \nOn completion the WT RPN is the summation of all part RPNs, therefore the share of each assembly, subassembly and part in \nthe WT RPN can be seen and high risk assemblies, subassemblies and parts identified by their RPNs.\nIt is possible to perform FMEA procedure by hand or using Microsoft Office Excel, however there are specific software tools\nfor this purpose.\n6. SOFTWARE BASED FMEA\nThe system reliability studies software tools, including FMEA, considered in this paper are as follows:\n\uf0b7 XFMEA [13]\n\uf0b7 Isograph Reliability Workbench [14]\n\uf0b7 Relex Reliability Studio 2007 V2[15]\nThe XFMEA software [13] has a basic user interface due to its spreadsheet format, two windows and minimal tool bars. A \nsystem hierarchy is used to show how the components of the FMEA are linked and systems can be collapsed or expanded to \nshow the full extent of the detail used in calculating the FMEA. There is no facility to enter data about the reliability of a \ncomponent, this limits the use of the software to smaller projects where this data is not considered important or is unavailable \ndue to low complexity.\nThe Isograph Reliability workbench program [14] is similar to XFMEA in using a spreadsheet format. It has a simple user \ninterface allowing efficient data input and software handling. The use of libraries for apportionment and phrasing allows \nrecording of commonly occurring components and their Failure Modes giving consistency to the system.\nRelex Reliability Studio 2007 V2 [15] is a comprehensive reliability software that can be used not only for the FMEA but also \nReliability Prediction, Fault Tree Analysis, Markov Modeling, Wiebull Analysis and Reliability Block Diagrams. The modules \nin Relex can be linked, so that a particular system can be analyzed from different reliability points of view.  \n7. THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE FOR A WT FMEA\nDue to the flexibility of Relex it has been adopted for the R80 FMEA in this paper. \nThree FMEA types are available in the software, functional, process or component FMEAs, based on FMEA standards. The \ncomponent FMEA is the most appropriate for analyzing the WT system due to the philosophy discussed in previous sections.  \nSeverity, occurrence and detection tables can be defined in the software by the user, although the software includes most \nstandard FMEA definitions within its databases. The Root Causes, Failure Modes and failure effects assigned within an FMEA \nproject can also be summarized on completion by the software in separate databases.\nAn essential feature of the software FMEA module are its Roll-up and Build features as shown for example in Table 9  for a \ngearbox assembly. \nRoll-up is exemplified by the fact that after inserting a Failure Mode and its local effect at part level the software automatically \nrolls this upwards as a Failure Mode in the subassembly above. \nBuild is exemplified by the fact that after inserting a local effect at assembly level the software automatically builds this \ndownwards as a next effect in the subassembly below. \nThese effects are shown in Table 9, where the shaded cells will be filled automatically by the Roll-up and Build features. \nTable 9\nRoll-up and Build of Failure Modes and Effects\nFailure Mode Local Effect Next Effect End Effect Severity\nAssembly Gearbox B C D E Marginal\nSubassembly Oil Lubricate A B C D Marginal\nPart Flow rate monitor False Output A B C Marginal\nA: System will not operate at desired level\nB: Reduction in the systems ability to cool oil\nC: Gearbox cannot achieve optimum power production\nD, E: WT cannot achieve optimum power production\nEach part level Failure Mode can have several Root Causes, for which their occurrence and detection values can be specified,\nbased upon the rules set at the start of the FMEA project. Eventually the severity values for Failure Modes and the occurrence \nand detection figures of related Root Causes will be multiplied to find the RPN for each part, subassembly, assembly and finally \nsystem.\nThe R80 WT subdivision in section four was used to build the main system tree configuration in the software. The proposed \nFailure Modes for all of the parts was considered from a 16 elements set, similarly Root Causes came from a 25 set. The FMEA \nmodel selected in the software permitted multiple Root Causes and a single effect for each Failure Mode, considered reasonable \nfor this study.     \nThe results of R80 WT FMEA and another configuration with equivalent BDFG replacing the DFIG in R80, built upon the main \nsystem tree of R80 with necessary modifications, will be presented and compared with reliability field data in next sections. \n8. INTERPRETING THE FMEA RESULTS FOR THE R80\nReliability data about WT assemblies has become available in recent years from surveys [12] , [16]. A useful outcome of an \nFMEA on a WT could be a comparison between the R80 assemblies\u2019 FMEA RPN results and their field failure rates, this is \ninvestigated here using field failure rate data from [12]. \nThe RPNs for the R80 WT assemblies from the software FMEA module, based on the criteria tables of 1-3, are tabulated in \nTable 10. The assemblies are sorted in descending order of their RPNs.\nTable 10\nR80 assembly RPNs\nOrder Assembly RPN\n1 Rotor and Blades Assembly 1609\n2 Generator 1204\n3 Electrical Controls 925\n4 Hydraulics 921\n5 Gearbox 909\n6 Grid and Electrical system 872\n7 Yaw System 813\n8 Pitch Control System 692\n9 Tower, Foundation and Nacelle 508\n10 Mechanical Brake 336\n11 Main Shaft 246\nFailure rates and RPNs have different scales so a per unit system has been used for comparison, whereby failure rates and RPNs \nare normalised to the highest assembly failure rate and RPN respectively. \nSuch a comparison is shown in Figure 2 where the horizontal axis represents the WT assemblies based on Table 10. No field \nfailure rate data was available for the Tower, Foundation and Nacelle assembly. Figure 2 shows some similarity between field \nfailure rate and RPN data for individual assemblies. However, there is a problem in comparing field failure rate and RPN \nbecause severity information cannot be concluded from failure rate data. However, detect ability is linked to failure rate because \nif a Root Cause is hard to detect, a failure is more likely to occur. \n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11\nWSD\nWSDN\nLWK\nRPN\nFig. 2. R80 per assembly RPN comparison with field failure rate data\nTherefore if field failure rate were to be compared with RPN, the failure rate should be multiplied by some measure of severity,\nsuch as the Mean Time To Repair (MTTR). Reviewing the definition of RPN and comparing it with the failure rate in reliability \ntheory therefore suggests that direct comparison may not be reasonable.  \nIt would seem more reasonable to compare the field failure rate data not with RPN but with the product of occurrence and \ndetection. This is shown in Figure 3. The same per unit system is used but the product of occurrence and detection is divided by \nthe highest RPN in Table 10 to show the reduction of these values compared to the RPN.\nIn addition [12] showed that the majority of Danish WTs in that reference were old and small compared to more modern \nGerman WTs, therefore as the R80 is a modern 2MW WT the Danish data has been omitted from Figure 3. \n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11\nWSD\nLWK\nDet. x Occ.\nFig. 3. R80 per assembly Detection x Occurrence comparison with field failure rate data\nFollowing these adjustments comparison between Figures 2 & 3 shows a meaningful similarity between field failure rate and the \nproduct of occurrence and detection in Figure 3. \nIt is noticeable that the main differences occurred for the electrical assemblies, Electrical control (3) and Grid and electrical \nsystem (6). It seems that failure rate of these assemblies are higher than would be predicted from the FMEA. This may be due to \nelectrical failures being more detectable than mechanical or material failures. \nThis analysis shows that it is reasonable to compare the qualitative results of an FMEA, specially the product of occurrence and\ndetection, to quantitative field failure rates. This could be useful in situations where there is a lack of the field failure rate data or \nduring the design stage of a new configuration. \n9. USING THE FMEA ON A CHANGED R80 WT\nThe R80 WT system is now changed by replacing the DFIG for a BDFG as proposed by [10] and calling the WT R80*. The \nDFIG in the R80 is a 4-pole machine with a rated shaft speed of 1500 rev\/min at 50 Hz. The equivalent BDFG has 4 and 8-pole \nmain and control stator windings respectively and a 6-pole rotor, hence a natural speed at 50 Hz. of 500rev\/min.  The lower \nmean operating speed of the BDFG necessitates a change in the gearbox ratio which means that only a 2 stage rather than a 3 \nstage gearbox is needed, therefore one of the parallel stages of the R80 gearbox can be eliminated.\nDue to the absence of brushes in the BDFG compared to the DFIG it is expected that BDFG will have a lower RPN but it has an \nextra stator winding and a special rotor winding design. The rotor considered will be a \u201cnested-loop\u201d design with insulated bars \nand an end ring as described in [10]. No reliability field data is available for this configuration, because the BDFG is new, so an \nFMEA of such a configuration and comparison with a conventional DFIG R80 could show the advantages or disadvantages \nbefore a WT is built.\nDue to changes only in the generator and gearbox the R80* FMEA was performed again for these two assemblies only. The \nsubassembly RPNs\u2019 percentage of this new generator configuration is compared with the R80 generator (DFIG) in Table 11.\nTable 11\nDFIG and BDFG subassemblies\u2019 RPN percentage\nSubassembly\nRPN Percentage\nDFIG BDFG\nEnclosure System 37% 46%\nStator 11% 24%\nRotor 40% (Including slip rings & brushes) 15%\nOthers 12% 15%\nThe RPN of the R80* generator (BDFG) and gearbox (two stages) compared to the R80 generator (DFIG) and gearbox (three \nstages) are shown in Table 12. \nTable 12\nGenerator and Gearbox data comparison\nWT Generator\nGenerator Gearbox\nRPN Failure rate RPN Failure rate \nDFIG 1204 0.206 909 0.36\nBDFG 972 0.172 (expected) 749 0.29 (expected)\nAlthough the BDFG has three windings, compared to the DFIG\u2019s two, the reduction in its RPN shows that the brushes and slip \nrings were dominant in generator RPN values. It was also predictable that the two stage gearbox RPN is less than the three \nstages. \nThe relationship between RPNs and failure rates investigated above suggests that a 20% reduction in generator and gearbox \nRPNs, indicates that the R80* will have a lower failure rate than the R80 due to the reduction in generator and gearbox faults. \nHowever, the introduction of BDFG technology into WTs may cause an initial increase in failure rate at the start of operation.   \n10. FAILURE MODE & ROOT CAUSE HIERARCHY\nA final useful analysis from the FMEA results is the occurrence frequency of the different Failure Modes and Root Causes. As \nmentioned before there are 16 main Failure Modes and 25 Root Causes considered in the R80 FMEA. These limited numbers of \nFailure Modes and Root Causes were repeated in 107 parts of the R80 structure. Counting these Failure Modes and Root Causes \nover the whole FMEA gives histograms for each, identifying the top 10 Failure Modes in Figure 4 and the same for Root Causes \nin Figure 5.\nTop 10 Failure Modes\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\nM\nat\ner\nia\nl F\nau\nlir\ne\nFr\nac\ntu\nre\nEl\nec\ntri\nca\nl F\nai\nlu\nre\nR\nup\ntu\nre\nBl\noc\nka\nge\nSt\nru\nct\nur\nal\n F\nai\nlu\nre\nM\nec\nha\nni\nca\nl F\nai\nlu\nre\nEl\nec\ntri\nca\nl I\nns\nul\nat\nio\nn \nFa\nilu\nre\nD\net\nac\nhm\nen\nt\nO\nut\npu\nt I\nna\ncc\nur\nac\ny\nOccurrence number\nFig. 4.

Top 10 Root Causes in R80 FMEA \nSimilarly the most frequent Root Cause is corrosion, which affects the material quality. This will be more important in future \noffshore WTs, so remedial design actions in this regard must be considered. \nIdentifying the most frequent Failure Modes and Root Causes will assist design improvement and maintenance optimization. A \ncost-benefit analysis for reducing WT failures could be conducted based on a priority list of the most frequent Failure Modes. A \nsimilar analysis could also be considered based on Failure Modes severity, for example by summating the severity of each \nFailure Mode in the FMEA, ranking the results and considering the costs incurred to alter the ranking. \n11. CONCLUSIONS\nA suitable FMEA software package has been chosen and successfully applied to a typical 2MW indirect drive, variable speed\nWT (R80). It has been shown that the software tool can serve as a preliminary failure rate prediction tool. This is an encouraging \nresult which demonstrates that the FMEA could be developed further for this purpose.\nThe software tool was then successfully applied to a 2MW WT incorporating a BDFG (R80*). The results showed that the R80* \nwas more reliable than the R80 due to the more reliable generator and gearbox assemblies.   \nThe RPN data calculated from the FMEA has been compared with field failure rate data for assemblies, showing some similarity\nbetween them. Further investigation has shown that comparison between the product of occurrence and detection and field \nfailure rates gives the closer comparison, giving confidence in the FMEA process. The product of occurrence and detection \nunder-estimates field failure rates, however this could be a useful tool for predicting failure rates in new turbine designs.\nOnce FMEA data was produced, it was ranked in assembly order giving a clear picture of the unreliability of assemblies,\nsubassemblies and parts. This could be a useful tool for designers to identify weak points in the WT design.\nA suggestion for improving this procedure would be to undertake the FMEA with the aid of a WT designer and O&M engineer. \nThis would focus on the problems of individual subassemblies and would provide a stronger indicator for those that need \nimprovement making the process less subjective.\nThe FMEA has the potential to improve the reliability of WT systems especially for the offshore environment, where reliability \nwill play a much stronger part in prospective cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, it is believed that in time, it will play a major role \nin the development of WTs, which require little or no maintenance, making wind a more cost-effective and sustainable energy \nresource.\n12.
