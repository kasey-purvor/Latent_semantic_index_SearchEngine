Observations of HF radar backscatter from arti-\nficial field-aligned irregularities in an ionosphere perturbed\nby travelling disturbances due to atmospheric gravity waves\nare presented. Some features of the spatio-temporal structure\nof the artificial radar backscatter can be explained in terms\nof the distortion of the ionosphere resulting from the travel-\nling disturbances. The distorted ionosphere can allow the HF\npump wave to access upper-hybrid resonance at larger dis-\ntances from the transmitter than are normally observed and\ncan also prevent the pump wave reaching this resonance at\nclose distances. The variation in altitude of the irregularities\nsometimes results in a significant variation in the elevation\nangle of arrival of the backscattered signal at the radar im-\nplying that the radar \u201csees\u201d a target moving in altitude. We\nsuggest that this may be evidence of off-orthogonal scatter-\ning from the irregularities.\nKeywords. Ionosphere (Active experiments; Ionospheric\ndisturbances; Ionospheric irregularities)\n1 Introduction\nAtmospheric gravity waves (AGW) have been the subject of\nmuch investigation (see the reviews by Yeh and Liu, 1974;\nFrancis, 1975; Hunsucker, 1982 and Hocke and Schlegel,\n1996). These waves in the neutral atmosphere are commonly\nobserved indirectly by their ionospheric signatures known as\ntravelling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs). The TID takes\nthe form of a wave-like perturbation in the plasma density\nwhich is mainly due to the neutral wind perturbation of the\nAGW dragging the plasma along the magnetic field and at the\nCorrespondence to: A. Senior\n(a.senior@lancaster.ac.uk)\nsame time compressing or expanding it. The detailed inter-\naction between the AGW and the ionosphere has been exam-\nined by Hooke (1970a,b); Kirchengast et al. (1996), amongst\nothers.\nAGWs and TIDs can be broadly classified into two cat-\negories, depending on their horizontal wavelength (Hun-\nsucker, 1982). Medium-scale waves have wavelengths of\nseveral hundred kilometres, periods in the 15\u201360-min range\nand horizontal speeds of 100\u2013250 m s\u22121. Large-scale waves\nhave wavelengths of more than 1000 km, periods in the\n30\u2013180-min range and horizontal speeds of 400\u20131000 m s\u22121.\nAt high-latitudes, the waves are thought to be mainly ex-\ncited by variations in Joule heating or Lorentz forcing asso-\nciated with electrojet currents (Chimonas and Hines, 1970),\nalthough other possibilities, including heating from particle\nprecipitation have been considered (Hunsucker, 1982).\nAccording to theory (Mayr et al., 1990) the waves may\npropagate directly in the thermosphere; with guidance from\nthe temperature gradient at the base of the thermosphere;\nby reflection from the ground or by trapping between the\nground and lower thermosphere. The large-scale waves suf-\nfer less attenuation than the medium-scale waves and so are\ndominant at large distances from the source. Since dissi-\npation is less in the lower atmosphere, the earth-reflected\nmode is important for the medium-scale waves as it permits\npropagation to longer distances. For an impulsive source at\nE-region heights (from an electrojet, for example), Francis\n(1974) showed that the earth-reflected medium-scale waves\nexhibit dispersion effects which result in a train of wave cy-\ncles being observed away from the source. The direct waves\nretain the impulsive character of the source.\nA number of observational techniques have been applied\nto TIDs \u2013 see the review articles cited earlier. For the pur-\nposes of the present results, the most relevant techniques are\nPublished by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n2348 A. Senior et al.: Gravity wave disturbances in artificial HF radar backscatter\nthe use of HF coherent scatter radars and incoherent scat-\nter radars. TIDs leave spatial and temporal signatures in\nthe power returned by backscattering of an HF radar sig-\nnal from the ground after reflection from the disturbed iono-\nsphere. These periodic power variations are produced by the\nfocussing and defocussing of the radar beam by the electron\ndensity perturbations in the ionosphere produced by the TID.\nSamson et al. (1990) presented observations of such power\nvariations which they interpreted as being due to equator-\nward propagating earth-reflected gravity waves. They were\nable to determine the horizontal wavelength, direction of\npropagation and phase speed of the waves from their ob-\nservations. Bristow and Greenwald (1995) developed an\napproach to allow the estimation of the TID amplitude in\nterms of the electron density perturbation from the ground\nbackscatter power variations. They found that the electron\ndensity perturbations were on the order of 20\u201335%. Arnold\net al. (1998) adopted a different approach to interpreting\nthe ground backscatter observations. Instead of using the\nbackscatter power variations, they examined the variation in\nthe range to the edge of the skip zone, the region of the\nEarth\u2019s surface from which ground backscatter cannot be\nobtained because the radar wave takeoff elevation angle re-\nquired to reach inside the zone is so high that the wave pen-\netrates the ionosphere (Davies, 1965). This range is modu-\nlated by the varying ionospheric electron density. They com-\npared their measurements, made with the HF radar at Han-\nkasalmi, Finland with electron density measurements from\nthe EISCAT UHF radar near Troms\u00f8, Norway and found\ngood correlation between the skip distance variation and the\nelectron density variation at a height of 235 km. We use the\nsame instrumentation in the present study.\nIncoherent scatter radar has also proven to be an important\nmethod for studying gravity waves. Most obviously, the ver-\ntical structure of the electron density perturbation is revealed,\nbut perturbations are seen in the other plasma parameters\ntoo. Schlegel (1986) used field-parallel ion velocities mea-\nsured by the EISCAT UHF radar to investigate AGWs since\nthe ion-neutral coupling makes this velocity a good tracer\nof the neutral velocity. Shibata and Schlegel (1993) also\nused EISCAT to examine the vertical structure of AGWs.\nThey mainly used the ion temperature perturbation since it\nis closely related to the neutral temperature variation in the\nlower thermosphere. Their observations clearly showed the\ncharacteristic phase progression of the AGWs with altitude:\ndownward (upward) phase propagation associated with up-\ngoing (down-going) waves. The ability to measure the effect\nof the AGW on the various plasma parameters makes the\nincoherent scatter technique particularly valuable in under-\nstanding the AGW-TID relationship and this was exploited\nby Kirchengast et al. (1996) who used a computational model\nof the ionospheric response to the thermospheric perturbation\nto determine AGW properties from the \u201cpolarisation\u201d infor-\nmation provided by the variations in the plasma parameters.\nArtificial field-aligned irregularities with small scales (of\nthe order of metres) transverse to the geomagnetic field are\none of the most important effects produced by the action of\na high-power O-mode HF pump wave on the ionospheric\nplasma (Gurevich, 1978; Robinson, 1989). The O-mode\nwave is converted to electrostatic upper-hybrid (UH) waves\non density irregularities in the vicinity of the level where\nthe pump frequency equals the plasma UH frequency. This\nupper-hybrid resonance (UHR) level occurs a few kilometres\nbelow the O-mode reflection altitude in typical ionospheric\nconditions. Excitation of the irregularities can take place\nfrom infinitesimal density fluctuations (Das and Fejer, 1979;\nDysthe et al., 1983) but with larger fluctuations, trapping of\nthe UH waves in the density depletions becomes important\n(Mj\u00f8lhus, 1983; Dysthe et al., 1982).\nThe saturation of the instability probably depends on a\nnumber of factors such as anomalous absorption of the\npump wave (Robinson, 1989), the nonlinear increase in\nfield-parallel thermal conductivity with electron temperature\n(Gurevich et al., 1995) and possibly destruction due to drift\nwaves excited by the steep temperature and density gradients\nassociated with the irregularities (Antani and Guzdar, 1999;\nBorisov, 2004).\nThe electron density fluctuations associated with the irreg-\nularities are effective at backscattering radio waves and so\nradar techniques are important for investigating the irregu-\nlarities. As a result of field-parallel diffusion being much\ngreater than field-transverse diffusion, the irregularities are\nhighly field-aligned. This results in the radar scattering be-\ning highly aspect-sensitive and backscatter is only observed\nwhen the radar beam is close to orthogonality with the ge-\nomagnetic field. This property was discovered in the early\nwork with the heater at Platteville, Colorado, USA (Thome\nand Blood, 1974; Fialer, 1974; Minkoff et al., 1974). In-\nsitu rocket measurements (Kelley et al., 1995; Franz et al.,\n1999) seem to confirm this picture. Franz et al. (1999) sug-\ngested that the elongation ratio of the irregularities could\nbe 5000 or more and in modelling radar backscatter based\non their in-situ measurements, they assumed infinite field-\nalignment and therefore infinite aspect sensitivity. Senior\net al. (2004) also assumed infinite aspect sensitivity in es-\ntimating the field-parallel length scale of the irregularities\nfrom multi-frequency HF radar measurements.\nBlagoveshchenskaya and Troshichev (1996) presented ob-\nservations of artificial F-region irregularities by continuous-\nwave HF Doppler sounding. They found oscillations in the\nDoppler frequency with periods of 12\u201325 min which they\nsuggested could be the effects of medium-scale TIDs in the\nheated ionosphere. In this paper we describe an experiment\nin which artificial F-region irregularities were observed with\na HF coherent scatter radar under conditions when the iono-\nsphere above the HF pump transmitter was disturbed by trav-\nelling ionospheric disturbances caused by atmospheric grav-\nity waves. Our primary concern will be with the effects of\nthe TIDs on the artificial irregularities and not with the TIDs\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 2347\u20132361, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/2347\/2006\/\nA.

We show how the key features of the radar ob-\nservations can be explained by how the access of the pump\nwave to upper-hybrid resonance is modified by the distortion\nof the ionosphere and we discuss the evidence provided by\nthe observations concerning the characteristics of the artifi-\ncial irregularities themselves.\n2 Instrumentation and observations\nDuring the interval 10:00\u201314:00 UT on 3 December 2004,\nthe CUTLASS HF coherent scatter radar (Lester et al., 2004)\nat Hankasalmi, Finland (62.32\u25e6 N, 26.61\u25e6 E) observed arti-\nficial field-aligned irregularities (AFAI) in the F-region in-\nduced by the EISCAT HF facility (Rietveld et al., 1993) lo-\ncated at Ramfjordmoen, Norway (69.58\u25e6 N, 19.22\u25e6 E). The\nHF facility operated on a 60 s on, 120 s off cycle, transmit-\nting an O-mode wave at 12\u25e6 south of the vertical in the mag-\nnetic meridian plane; approximately in the direction of the\ngeomagnetic field in the F-region. The pump frequency was\n4.544 MHz between 10:00 UT and 13:55 UT. From 13:55 UT\nto 14:13 UT, the pump frequency was 4.04 MHz. How-\never, the ionosphere had already weakened sufficiently by\n13:55 UT that no heating effects were seen. The effective\nisotropic radiated power was 100 MW and the beam full-\nwidth at half-maximum power was 11.3\u25e6. The CUTLASS\nradar operated in stereo mode with channel A observing a\nsingle beam in the direction of the HF facility. The radar\nfrequency was cycled over 10 frequency bands from approx-\nimately 9\u201320 MHz, with a nominal 1 s dwell time on each\nband. Seventy 15-km range gates were used with the nominal\nfirst gate at 480 km from the radar. The channel B observa-\ntions will not be discussed here. Figure 1 shows the location\nof the HF facility, the CUTLASS radar and the radar field-\nof-view.\nThe top three panels of Fig. 2 show the CUTLASS\nbackscatter signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) versus range and\ntime for sounding frequencies of 13.2, 15.1 and 18.0 MHz.\nIn the group range interval 800\u20131100 km, strong periodic\nbackscatter enhancements due to AFAI can be seen. Beyond\n1200 km on 13.2 MHz, strong ground scatter returns are ob-\nserved. These ground scatter returns exhibit quasi-periodic\nmodulation of the skip distance.\nThe backscatter from the AFAI also shows strong mod-\nulation in both location and intensity with time. The\nmost prominent perturbations occur in the intervals 11:30\u2013\n12:00 UT (\u201cC\u201d in Fig. 2; the significance of this annota-\ntion will become clear in due course) and 12:30\u201313:00 UT\n(\u201cE\u201d) when AFAI-induced backscatter appears at around\n1100 km and then seems to travel towards the radar, merging\nwith the bulk of the artificial backscatter and then emerg-\ning and travelling towards 750 km before vanishing. The\ncharacteristics of these perturbations vary with frequency.\nFor example, at 18.0 MHz, the equatorward projection of\nthe disturbances (closer than about 850 km) is absent; in\n \n 20 oW \n \n \n 0 o\n \n \n \n 20oE \n \n \n40\noE \n \n \n60\no E \n \n 60 oN \n \n 65 oN \n \n 70 oN \n \n 75 oN \n \n 80 oN \nFig. 1.

The circle denotes\nthe EISCAT UHF radar and EISCAT HF facility. The crosses indi-\ncate the UHF radar scan positions at an altitude of 250 km.\naddition, at 13.2 MHz, the second perturbation produces\na strong, localised enhancement in backscatter power be-\ntween about 850 and 1000 km during the interval 12:30\u2013\n12:45 UT, whereas a similar enhancement seems to occur\nslightly earlier and over the range interval from 900\u20131050 km\nat 15.1 MHz and is not obvious at all at 18.0 MHz. Besides\nthese two large perturbations, similar, less dramatic effects\ncan be seen in the artificial backscatter at other times (\u201cA\u201d,\n\u201cB\u201d, \u201cD\u201d, and \u201cG\u201d).\nDuring this interval of observation, the EISCAT UHF in-\ncoherent scatter radar (Rishbeth and van Eyken, 1993), co-\nlocated with the HF facility, was observing the ionosphere.\nThe radar performed a 360 s scan cycle in which the an-\ntenna moved between four pointing directions. This included\nthe nominal F-region \u201cfield-aligned\u201d position of 184.0\u25e6 az-\nimuth, 77.1\u25e6 elevation. The radar dwelled on this position\nfor 30 s before the UT 6-min boundary when the HF facil-\nity pump wave was switched on and continued to dwell for\na further 60 s until the pump was switched off. Since the\nUHF radar cycle was twice as long as the pump cycle, only\nevery second pump cycle was observed with the UHF radar\npointing into the pumped plasma. At other times, the UHF\nradar made measurements at lower elevations in the direc-\ntion of the CUTLASS radar site. The radar was pointed on\nan azimuth of 154.1\u25e6, towards Hankasalmi at elevations of\n45.1\u25e6, 28.8\u25e6and 20\u25e6. These positions were chosen to give\nan equal horizontal spacing of \u223c175 km at an altitude of\n250 km. The dwell time increased from 30 s at 45.1\u25e6 eleva-\ntion to 75 s at 20\u25e6 elevation in order to mitigate the effects of\nthe reduced signal-to-noise ratio due to the increased distance\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/2347\/2006\/ Ann.

Senior et al.: Gravity wave disturbances in artificial HF radar backscatter 2351\nto the scattering volume at a given altitude. The scan pattern\nwas intended to allow a 2-D section of the ionosphere along\nthe Hankasalmi-Troms\u00f8 path to be reconstructed for the pur-\npose of raytracing the HF radar beam. Fig. 1 shows the UHF\nradar scan positions at an altitude of 250 km.\nThe solid line in the fourth panel of Fig. 2 shows the alti-\ntude at which the HF-pump-enhanced ion line was observed\nby the UHF radar when in the field-aligned pointing direc-\ntion. This enhancement in incoherent backscatter power is\ndue to ion-acoustic waves stimulated by the HF pump wave\nand occurs close to the reflection height of the HF pump wave\n(Stubbe et al., 1992). It is thus a proxy for the pump reflection\nheight. The location of the enhancement was determined by\ninspection of profiles of the backscatter power in the 12 \u00b5 s\nfractional lag (the shortest non-zero lag) of the alternating\ncode in the tau2pl radar program. This gives a range reso-\nlution of \u223c1.8 km. The enhancement is usually well-defined\nand so we estimate an error of \u00b12 km in assigning it to a\nparticular altitude.\nThe pump reflection altitude inferred from the black line\ninitially shows a periodic variation with a range of about\n15 km. At about 11:45 UT there is a large increase in re-\nflection altitude of 35 km. Thereafter, the reflection altitude\ndrops, with some fluctuation until an even larger increase of\n45 km occurs at about 12:42 UT. The reflection altitude then\ndrops again and fluctuates until 13:42 UT. After this time,\nno ion-line enhancements were detected, which is probably\nbecause the plasma density had fallen too low for the HF\npump wave to interact. It is also worth noting that no en-\nhancements were seen during the pump-on periods at 11:48\nand 12:42 UT, during the intervals where the reflection height\nappeared to jump dramatically upwards.\nThe fourth panel of Fig. 2 also shows relative electron\ndensity perturbations (1N\/N) versus altitude and time mea-\nsured by the UHF radar in the field-aligned pointing direction\nwhile the pump wave was off, to avoid possible contamina-\ntion from heating effects. The integration time was thus 30 s.\nThe relative perturbation was computed by subtracting a lin-\near fit to the density time series at each altitude and then di-\nviding the residuals by this fit. The relative error in the elec-\ntron density N according to the radar analysis software was\nless than 0.1 (and often less than 0.05) in the altitude range\n200\u2013350 km. Below 200 km, the relative error increased and\nwas more variable, but was usually below 0.2. As the radar\nmeasurement is not absolute, the electron densities were cal-\nibrated against the EISCAT Dynasonde and found to agree\nwithin about 10%.\nA number of quasi-periodic, sloping features can be seen\nin the plot of electron density perturbations. In the interval\n10:00\u201312:00 UT, these are most prominent between about\n170 and 280 km, with the largest variation at around 190 km.\nThe density perturbation here oscillates between about +0.3\nand \u20130.2 with a period of \u223c1800\u20132400 s. Three peaks la-\nbelled A, B and C can be seen in this interval and these co-\nincide with the minima in the altitude of the enhanced ion-\nline. The third peak, around 11:30 UT, is followed by the first\nlarge increase in pump reflection height. The relative density\nperturbation here varies from around +0.5 to \u20130.3 (or maybe\nmore) and is thus somewhat more intense than the preced-\ning two. Between 12:00 and 13:00 UT a much more intense\nsloping perturbation can be seen, varying between about +0.8\nand \u20130.5 at its most intense around 190 km at 12:45 UT (E).\nBefore this, around 12:15 UT there is perhaps evidence of a\nweaker sloping perturbation (D), particularly at 200 km and\nabove, though this is unclear due to large fluctuations in the\nelectron density profile at 12:12 UT. Also, after 13:00 UT,\nthere is evidence of three more perturbations, the final one\naround 13:45 UT (H) stronger than the first two (F and G)\nand more evident at lower altitudes. The first of these does\nnot seem to have any significant associated reflection height\nchange, whereas the second shows a small peak at 13:30 UT.\nThe final one (H) coincides with the weakening of the iono-\nsphere resulting in no further ion line enhancements.\nTo set the observations in context, the dashed line in\nthe fourth panel of Fig. 2 represents the altitude of the\nF-region density peak. The bottom panel of the figure shows\nthe F-region O-mode critical frequency and how this com-\npares to the pump frequency in use during the experiment\n(4.544 MHz). These parameters were determined from the\nUHF radar electron density profiles. The dramatic weaken-\ning of the ionosphere after about 13:30 UT is clearly seen in\nthe critical frequency.\nFinally, in Fig. 3, we present elevation angle-of-arrival\nmeasurements for the HF radar backscatter. The top, mid-\ndle and bottom panels correspond to sounding frequencies\nof 13.2, 15.1 and 18.0 MHz respectively, analogous to the\ntop three panels of Fig. 2. The elevation angle is determined\nby comparing the phase of the received signal between the\nmain antenna array and the secondary interferometer array\nin the manner described by Milan et al. (1997). The absolute\nphase difference between receive paths of the two arrays is\naffected by an offset due to the receiver electronics, which\ncauses a systematic error in the elevation angles. In order to\ncompensate for this phase offset, a phase correction was em-\npirically computed so that the elevation angles of the main\nbody of scatter (not including the large perturbations C and\nE, for example) were close to those predicted by a raytracing\ncalculation. The ionospheric model used in the raytracing\nwas a 2-D \u201cslice\u201d along the HF radar path determined from\nthe four UHF radar scan positions. Thus, it should be borne\nin mind that the elevation angles presented here have been\npost-processed in this way and are not therefore truly inde-\npendent measurements. Nevertheless, it is expected that at\nleast the relative differences between angles on a given fre-\nquency should be realistic and that is all that we shall require\nin our analysis.\nFigure 3 shows that on all frequencies, the large perturba-\ntions \u201cC\u201d and \u201cE\u201d cause increases in the elevation angle of\nthe backscattered signal. The change is particularly strong at\n13.2 MHz, where the angle increases from \u223c6\u25e6 to \u223c22\u25e6. At\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/2347\/2006\/ Ann.

Top panel: 13.2 MHz; centre panel: 15.1 MHz; bottom panel:\n18.0 MHz. The frequencies and time intervals correspond to the backscatter SNR data in the top three panels of Fig. 2.\n15.1 MHz, the change is from \u223c7\u25e6 to \u223c16\u25e6and at 18.0 MHz\nthe change is much less, from \u223c8\u25e6 to \u223c12\u25e6. It is also evi-\ndent that the smaller perturbations produce variations in the\nelevation angles. The significance of these apparent changes\nin elevation angle will be discussed later.\nThe geophysical conditions on the day the observations\nwere made were very quiet; Kp ranged from 0+ to 1\u2212 during\nthe interval 00:00 UT to 15:00 UT and Dst ranged from \u221228\nto \u221221 nT during the same interval.\n3 Discussion\n3.1 The gravity wave\/TID signatures\nThe ground scatter skip distance variations in the top panel\nof Fig. 2 are very similar to those discussed by Arnold et al.\n(1998) and strongly suggest atmospheric gravity wave ac-\ntivity creating travelling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs),\ntravelling in a direction with a component towards the\nCUTLASS radar. Considering the skip distance involved,\nit seems highly likely that the disturbance causing the skip\ndistance variation will also pass through the ionosphere over\nthe EISCAT site, since this is approximately mid-way be-\ntween the CUTLASS radar and the edge of the skip zone and\ntherefore close to where the radar rays are refracted back to\nearth in the F-region.\nThis idea is supported by the EISCAT UHF radar obser-\nvations in the fourth panel of Fig. 2. The density perturba-\ntions in the lower panel show the classic behaviour expected\nfrom a gravity-wave-induced TID (Shibata and Schlegel,\n1993). The sloping features in which the density perturba-\ntion propagates down from higher to lower altitudes with\ntime are what would be expected from a gravity wave with\ndownward-sloping phase fronts passing through the thermo-\nsphere over the radar. From these density perturbations,\nwe may estimate the vertical wavelength \u03bbz and vertical\nphase speed vz of the gravity wave\/TID. For the negative-\ngoing half-cycle of the perturbation between about 11:30\nand 12:00 UT, we obtain from Fig. 2 \u03bbz\u2248160 km, T\u22482200 s\nand hence vz\u2248\u221270 m s\u22121, where the negative sign indi-\ncates downward propagation. For the more intense negative-\ngoing half-cycle between 12:30 and 13:00 UT we obtain\n\u03bbz\u2248140 km, T\u22481800 s and hence vz\u2248\u221280 m s\u22121. These two\nhalf-cycles have rather similar vertical dispersion character-\nistics. Note that we are assuming there is no significant\nAnn.

As Shibata\nand Schlegel (1993) pointed out, this can lead to a signifi-\ncant error in estimating the true wave parameters because of\nthe Doppler shift arising from the neutral wind. Fortunately,\nin this study the apparent wave parameters are sufficient to\nallow us to interpret the observations.\nComparing the density perturbation in the fourth panel of\nFig. 2 with the CUTLASS ground scatter returns in the top\npanel, we can associate the skip distance perturbations with\nthe density perturbations rather well. The density perturba-\ntions in the fourth panel of Fig. 2 have been labelled A\u2013H.\nNote that the identification of D and F is somewhat unclear.\nBy comparing the relative timing of these to the timing of\nthe skip distance perturbations, we have assigned the same\nlabels to what we believe are the corresponding skip distance\nperturbations. The weak density perturbations D, F and G do\nnot have any obvious signature in the CUTLASS data, but the\nskip distance might simply be beyond the range of the obser-\nvations. The larger perturbation H has no obvious signature\neither. This may be partly due to the collapse in ionospheric\ndensities after \u223c13:30 UT causing the average skip distance\nto increase to well beyond the range of observation.\nThe fact that the density perturbations seem to associate\nwith the skip distance perturbations suggests that they are in-\ndeed the density signatures of the TIDs travelling with a com-\nponent towards the CUTLASS radar. This confirms that the\nTIDs do indeed pass through the ionosphere over the EIS-\nCAT site and hence may influence the production of AFAI\nby the HF facility. Indeed, the information on the height of\nthe enhanced ion-line in the fourth panel of Fig. 2 suggests\nthat the density perturbations lead to rather large variations in\nthe pump reflection altitude. The AFAI are produced around\nthe upper-hybrid resonance (UHR) altitude which is located\nslightly (typically a few kilometres) below the reflection alti-\ntude, thus we can can expect the location of the AFAI to vary\nin altitude as the TID passes through the pumped volume of\nplasma.\nWhat is surprising are the large horizontal extensions of\nthe AFAI backscatter regions associated particularly with\nTIDs C and E. It appears that as the TIDs approach the HF\nfacility, AFAI is produced a great distance (\u223c200 km) pole-\nward of the centre of the normal AFAI region. This exten-\nsion moves towards the normal region and merges with it,\nsubsequently to emerge on the equatorward edge and con-\ntinue to approach the radar to a range of about 200 km closer\nthan the centre of the normal region. This means that over-\nall, the heater is able to excite AFAI over a range interval of\naround 400 km (but not simultaneously). This is very much\ngreater than the \u223c200 km normally observed (Bond et al.,\n1997; Robinson et al., 1998). As the AFAI backscatter exten-\nsions are approaching the poleward edge of the normal AFAI\nregion, the poleward edge of the normal region sometimes\nappears to be \u201ceroded\u201d.\nIn order to estimate the horizontal dispersion characteris-\ntics of the gravity waves\/TIDs, we examined the UHF radar\nmeasurements made at the 45.1\u25e6 elevation direction towards\nHankasalmi. A plot of relative electron density perturbations\n(not shown) computed in the same way as the fourth panel\nof Fig. 2 revealed very similar-looking perturbations. Per-\nturbations A, B, C, E and H could be identified. At an al-\ntitude of 190 km, the positive peaks of these perturbations\noccurred approximately 1500 s later at the 45.1\u25e6 elevation\nposition than at the field-aligned position. The horizontal\ndistance between radar scan positions at 190 km is 150 km\nand so the component of the TID phase speed along the di-\nrection of the EISCAT-CUTLASS path is \u223c100 m s\u22121. This\ndirection is nearly meridional (20\u25e6 west of geographic north;\nsee Fig. 1). Based on the periods estimated earlier, we con-\nclude that the component of the horizontal wavelength in the\ndirection of the EISCAT-CUTLASS path for perturbations C\nand E is respectively \u223c220 km and \u223c180 km. The four UHF\nradar scan positions are (almost) collinear and so we can-\nnot estimate the propagation direction of the TID from these\nmeasurements.\nBesides the backscatter power and elevation angle mea-\nsurements, the CUTLASS radar also measures the line-of-\nsight velocity of the irregularities and it may be thought that\nthese could add additional information to the picture of the\nTIDs. We have chosen not to include these measurements\nbecause firstly the relationship between the line-of-sight ve-\nlocity of the irregularities and the TID parameters is not\nstraightforward (as the following sections go some way to\nindicate) and secondly because the measurements are also\naffected by other phenomena, particularly E\u00d7B drift due to\nmagnetospheric ULF waves (Yeoman and Wright, 2001) and\nthese make interpretation difficult. A complete discussion\nof the TID effects on all the key parameters measured by\nCUTLASS is beyond the scope of this study.\nOn the basis of our measurements of the TID parameters,\nthe waves would fall into the medium-scale category dis-\ncussed in the Introduction. The train of wave cycles is sug-\ngestive of a dispersed earth-reflected wave from an impulsive\nsource, but it may also arise from direct waves from a series\nof source impulses (Francis, 1974).\n3.2 Simulation of TID effect on HF pump propagation\nIt is clear that when a TID is present in the ionosphere, the\nsurfaces of constant plasma density are distorted due to the\nassociated density perturbations. It seems plausible that the\ndistorted surfaces might make it possible for the HF pump\nwave to excite AFAI at distances far from where this would\nbe expected in a spherically-stratified ionosphere. In order\nto test this hypothesis, a raytracing simulation of the pump\nbeam was carried out in a model ionosphere distorted by a\nTID. The raytracing was performed using a modified version\nof the Jones and Stephenson (1975) code. The original code\ncontains a subroutine (known as WAVE2) which can be used\nas a simple model of a TID. A very similar model to this was\nused by Georges and Stephenson (1969) to simulate ground\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/2347\/2006\/ Ann. Geophys., 24, 2347\u20132361, 2006\n2354 A.

Note that a more sophis-\nticated approach to modelling a gravity-wave-induced TID\nwas adopted by Huang et al. (1998), who treated the electron\ndensity perturbations by modelling the ionospheric response\nto the thermospheric wave. Our simplified approach is suf-\nficient to capture the main details of the observations. The\nJones and Stephenson WAVE2 model expresses the gravity-\nwave-induced electron density perturbation as follows\nN =N0\n[\n1+\u03b4ArA\u03b8 cos 2pi\n(\nt \u2032+\n(\npi\n2\n\u2212\u03b8\n)\nRE\/\u03bbx+z\/\u03bbz\n)]\n(1)\nAr= exp[\u2212((z\u2212 z0)\/H wave)2] (2)\nA\u03b8= exp[\u2212((\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b80)\/\u03b8c)2] (3)\n\u03b80=\u03b800 + \u03bbx t \u2032vgx\/vxRE , (4)\nwhere N0 is the undisturbed background electron density, \u03b4\nis the amplitude of the perturbation, \u03bbx , \u03bbz are the horizontal\n(meridional) and vertical wavelengths of the wave, \u03b8 is co-\nlatitude and RE is the radius of the Earth. The factors Ar and\nA\u03b8 determine the amplitude variation with altitude z and lat-\nitude; the peak height is z0 and the peak co-latitude \u03b80. The\nscale height of the amplitude is Hwave and the scale latitude\nis \u03b8c. The variable t \u2032 represents time in units of the wave\nperiod. The final equation represents the horizontal group\npropagation of the wave envelope with speed vgx . The hori-\nzontal phase speed is vx . \u03b800 is the starting co-latitude of the\nenvelope peak at t \u2032=0.\nThe background electron density was represented by an\n\u03b1-Chapman layer, with scale height, peak height and peak\ndensity independent of position. The geomagnetic field was\nincluded in a dipole approximation and dipole co-ordinates\nwere used in the calculations. Therefore, \u03b8 is dipole co-\nlatitude and the TID propagates along the magnetic merid-\nian. From our observations, we cannot be sure how realistic\nthis is.\nWe first concentrate on the largest perturbation \u201cE\u201d in\nFig. 2. Referring to the fourth panel of Fig. 2, we have\n\u03b4\u22480.65, z0\u2248190 km, Hwave\u224860 km and (from Sect. 3.1)\n\u03bbz\u2248140 km. We take \u03bbx=200 km. Now, from Fig. 2, we\nsee that \u201cE\u201d is relatively isolated from the adjacent parts of\nthe wave train; the preceding (tentative) perturbation \u201cD\u201d and\nthe succeeding \u2019F\u2019 are both rather weak in comparison. Thus\nwe make use of the factor A\u03b8 to localise the perturbation in\nthe model by taking \u03b8c=1\u25e6. Furthermore, we choose the hori-\nzontal group speed vgx equal to the horizontal phase speed vx\nso that the waveform retains the same shape as it travels over\nthe HF pump transmitter. Both speeds are taken as 100 m s\u22121\nand so we neglect dispersion in the AGW\/TID propagation.\nWe centre the envelope on the negative-going zero-crossing\nof the density perturbation waveform in order to best model\nthe density perturbation \u201cE\u201d.\nThe background \u03b1-Chapman layer was chosen to have a\npeak height of 240 km, a scale height of 30 km and a peak\nplasma frequency of 5.4 MHz. These parameters were based\non the EISCAT radar measurements. The raytracing was then\ncarried out for time increments of 0.05 of a wave period over\nthe range from \u20131 to 1 (two wave periods). The HF pump\nrays launched in the magnetic meridian plane were traced\nfor 1\u25e6 steps of elevation from 45\u25e6 to the zenith. Finally,\nthe points where the up-going rays intersected the UHR level\nwere determined. The results are shown in Fig. 4.\nIt is immediately clear that the figure shows some strong\nsimilarities to the HF radar backscatter RTI plots in the top\nthree panels of Fig. 2. A poleward projection of the region\nwhere UHR is attained by the pump wave appears as the TID\napproaches the pump transmitter and then merges with the\nnormal band of UHR within \u00b1100 km of the transmitter, fi-\nnally emerging again and projecting equatorward as the TID\nprogresses. At the same time as the TID is approaching, a\nclear erosion of the region where UHR is attained is seen,\ncreating a narrow V-shaped \u201cnotch\u201d on the poleward side\nof the main backscatter region. This explains the absence\nof backscatter in a similarly-shaped region in the RTI plots,\nsince the pump is unable to excite AFAI in this region. The\npassage of TID \u201cE\u201d creates a very strong change in UHR alti-\ntude, which agrees with the observed change in the height of\nthe enhanced ion line, since both are correlated with change\nin pump reflection height. Weaker changes in UHR altitude\nare seen before and after the passage of TID \u201cE\u201d. These are\ndue to the weaker wave cycles preceding and succeeding \u201cE\u201d\nin the model, as a result of the envelope shaping; although\nthis was not intended, to some extent these may represent the\neffects of TIDs D and F.\nThe \u201cerosion\u201d effect raises an interesting question about\ninferring the TID speed from the HF radar backscatter RTI\nplot. It is evident from the observations in Fig. 2 and the\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 2347\u20132361, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/2347\/2006\/\nA. Senior et al.: Gravity wave disturbances in artificial HF radar backscatter 2355\nsimulation in Fig. 4 that the slope of the equatorward edge of\nthe V-shaped notch region of weak or no backscatter is less\nsteep than the slope of the poleward edge (or else it would\nnot be V-shaped). The question is, which of these slopes rep-\nresents the speed of the TID? By estimating the slopes from\nthe simulation in Fig. 4, we find that the slope of the pole-\nward edge corresponds to a speed of \u223c160 m s\u22121 whereas\nthat of the equatorward edge corresponds to \u223c100 m s\u22121.\nThe phase and group speeds of the TID in the model were\nboth 100 m s\u22121, so it appears that the equatorward edge of the\nnotch more accurately represents the speed of the TID. Care-\nful examination of plots of the pump raytrace (not shown) at\ndifferent times during the TID passage reveal that the reason\nfor the more rapid motion of the poleward edge (where the\nUHR altitude is raised) is due to the motion of the region\nwhere the pump reaches UHR relative to the TID itself, as\nthe geometry changes. The raised UHR region travels for-\nward relative to the TID wave and thus the total speed of this\nregion is more rapid than the speed of the TID alone.\nWe now turn our attention to the weaker disturbances A\nand B. To simulate these, we use the same parameters as for\nE, except that we choose \u03b4=0.25, \u03bbx=240 km and the height\nof the background F-region peak to be 230 km. In addi-\ntion, we do not localise the wave amplitude in latitude and\nlet \u03b8c\u2192\u221e. The result is shown in Fig. 5, which shows two\ncomplete wave cycles.\nIt is evident that this simulation does not match the ob-\nservations so closely. In particular, the erosion on the pole-\nward edge of the UHR region is not mirrored in the HF\nradar backscatter in Fig. 2, although small poleward exten-\nsions of the backscatter region can be discerned, especially\nat 18.0 MHz. On the other hand, the equatorward projection\nof the UHR region as the TID passes is clearly seen in the\ndata for perturbation A, if not for perturbation B.\nIn summary, our simple raytracing model of the pump\nwave propagation in a TID-perturbed ionosphere appears to\nreproduce the essential features of the observations. A more\nsophisticated model might improve the agreement in some of\nthe details.\n3.3 TID effect on HF radar observations of the artificial\nirregularities\nEarlier, we remarked on the artificial backscatter power and\nelevation angle variations. We have shown how the TID af-\nfects the altitude and location at which the HF pump can\nreach upper-hybrid resonance. Clearly, this modification\nmust influence the target seen by the HF radar. In addition,\nit is possible that the TID may have a significant effect on\nthe radar beam propagation which could also affect how the\nradar views the artificial irregularities.\nFrom theory (for example, Booker, 1956), the scattering\ncross-section of the artificial irregularities is proportional to\u2329\n1N2\n\u232a\n, the mean-square electron density perturbation. The\nirregularities are expected to be most intense close to the\n\u22121 \u22120.8 \u22120.6 \u22120.4 \u22120.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n\u2212250\n\u2212200\n\u2212150\n\u2212100\n\u221250\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\nTime (wave periods)\nM\ner\nid\nio\nna\nl d\nist\nan\nce\n n\nor\nth\n o\nf h\nea\nte\nr (\nkm\n)\nTID simulation \u2019A&B\u2019\nUH\nR \nal\ntit\nud\ne \n(km\n)\n180\n187\n194\n201\n208\n215\n222\n229\n236\n243\n250\nFig. 5.

Thus the scattering cross-\nsection will vary in a similar way. At the same time, the scat-\ntering cross-section also depends on the radar beam aspect\nangle relative to the magnetic field, which determines the ma-\njor axis of the irregularities. This is because, due to the more\nrapid diffusion along the field than across it, the wavenum-\nber spectrum of the irregularities along the magnetic field\nis biased towards very small wavenumbers, whereas across\nthe magnetic field high wavenumbers (comparable to the HF\nradar wavenumber) predominate. Thus, at even a small angle\naway from orthogonality to the magnetic field, the wavenum-\nber spectrum rapidly shrinks towards low wave numbers and\nthe scattering cross-section at the radar wavenumber rapidly\ndiminishes.\nLet us consider two limiting cases: (1) the irregularities are\nvery elongated along the magnetic field and highly aspect-\nsensitive; (2) the irregularities have little elongation and are\nnot very aspect-sensitive. In case 1, the radar will receive\nbackscatter only when the beam is very close to exact orthog-\nonality to the geomagnetic field. If the irregularities move\nup and down in altitude, the backscatter power will vary ac-\ncording to the variation of the mean-square density perturba-\ntion with altitude. Assuming that the radar beam propaga-\ntion is not too strongly influenced by the TID, the locus in\nthe ionosphere where the beam reaches orthogonality does\nnot vary. Therefore, the source location of the backscatter\ndoes not vary and in particular, the elevation angle of the\nbackscatter (at a given range) will not vary. In other words,\nthe radar does not \u201csee\u201d the height variation of the irregular-\nities as variations in elevation angle: the target appears fixed\nat the location defined by orthogonality of the beam to the\nmagnetic field.\nIn case 2, the radar will receive backscatter only when\nthe beam passes very close to the location of the (short)\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/2347\/2006\/ Ann.

If the altitude\nof the irregularities varies, the backscatter power will vary\naccording to the aspect angle of the radar beam to the irreg-\nularities at the altitude in question. Once again, assuming no\nstrong influence of the TID on the radar beam propagation,\nthe fact that the radar only receives backscatter from close to\nthe altitude of the target means that the radar will now \u201csee\u201d\nthe altitude variation as a variation in elevation angle. This is\nanalogous to the simple case of straight-line propagation to a\nlocalised target.\nWith these cases in mind, we now apply our raytracing\nmodel additionally to the radar propagation in order to esti-\nmate the effects of the TID on the radar observations. Fig-\nure 6 shows the results of raytracing the radar beam at 13\nand 18 MHz in the model ionosphere used to simulate TIDs\nA and B in the previous section. The radar rays were traced\nat 1 degree increments of elevation angle from 5\u25e6 to 45\u25e6.\nThe angle of the rays from orthogonality was calculated by\ncomparing the wave normal vectors with the magnetic field\ndirection obtained from the IGRF model for 2004 (although\nthe dipole field model was retained in the actual raytracing\ncalculations). The locus of UH resonance is computed by\nraytracing the pump wave as described in the previous sec-\ntion.\nFor a radar frequency of 13 MHz (top panel), we see that\nthe locus of upper-hybrid resonance always lies in a region\nwhere the radar rays are more than 10\u25e6 from orthogonality,\neither in the region of defocussed Pedersen rays or in the\nregion of down-going, reflected rays. In case 1 above, we\nwould expect to receive backscatter mainly from the down-\nward extension of the irregularities from the UHR altitude to-\nwards the locus of radar beam orthogonality around 180-km\nAnn.

According to Fig. 2, the backscatter\npower on 13.2 MHz during the passage of TIDs A and B is\nweak and it is difficult to discern any power variations asso-\nciated with the passage of the TIDs. Likewise, in Fig. 3 it is\neven more difficult to detect any systematic changes in ele-\nvation angles. There are indications of higher angles at the\npoleward edge of the artificial backscatter, but it is not clear\nhow these relate to the TIDs. In this case it is difficult to draw\nany conclusions about which, if either, of the limiting cases\nmight be closest to the true situation.\nThe bottom panel of Fig. 6 shows a radar frequency of\n18 MHz. The situation here is rather different. At close\nranges (\u223c850 km), the UHR locus always lies in a region\nwhere the radar beam is about 1\u25e6 or less from orthogonality.\nHowever, at greater ranges (\u223c950 km) the radar beam at the\nUHR locus varies from being 3\u20134\u25e6 from orthogonality to less\nthan 1\u25e6 from orthogonality as the UHR height varies with\nthe passage of the TID. At the same time, the UHR altitude\nvaries from about 0\u201310 km above the radar orthogonality al-\ntitude. Referring now to the observation in Figs. 2 and 3,\nwe can see that towards the equatorward edge of the artificial\nbackscatter, the power is relatively constant, whereas towards\nthe poleward edge, there is a clear oscillation in the power\nassociated with the passage of TIDs A and B. The variation\nis around 10 dB peak-peak. Comparing this with the eleva-\ntion angles, whilst the angles are relatively constant towards\nthe equatorward edge, they also show a systematic variation\ntowards the poleward edge. The variation is around 5\u25e6 peak-\npeak and is out of phase with the variation in backscatter\npower.\nNow, from our earlier discussion, it is clear that these ob-\nservations correspond most closely with case 2, which can\nexplain the variation in elevation angle as a consequence of\nthe change in altitude of UHR. However, the observed el-\nevation angle variation of 5\u25e6 peak-peak does appear to be\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/2347\/2006\/ Ann. Geophys., 24, 2347\u20132361, 2006\n2358 A. Senior et al.: Gravity wave disturbances in artificial HF radar backscatter\nsomewhat larger than might be expected from our raytracing.\nThe raytracing suggests perhaps only 2\u20133\u25e6 peak-peak varia-\ntion as a result of the UHR locus moving across rays. The\nanticorrelation of power with elevation angle is what would\nbe expected, since higher elevation angles correspond to a\nhigher UHR altitude which is further from radar orthogonal-\nity and gives rise to a reduced backscatter power.\nFigure 7 shows a similar raytracing analysis to Fig. 6,\nbut for the larger-amplitude TID E. We consider the lower\npanel, for 18 MHz radar frequency first and once again we\nfind that the behaviour depends on range. At closer ranges\n(\u223c850 km), the UHR locus always lies close (within 1\u25e6) to\nradar beam orthogonality, despite the large variations in UHR\naltitude. Thus in either of our limiting cases, we would not\nexpect much change in backscatter power as the UHR alti-\ntude varies. In case 2 we might see elevation angle variations\nof 2\u25e6\u20133\u25e6 as the UHR locus moves across the rays. At fur-\nther ranges (\u223c950 km), the increase in UHR altitude would\ntake the UHR locus away from orthogonality by 1\u25e6\u20132\u25e6and\nperhaps about 10 km above the locus of exact orthogonality\n(the increase in altitude is more easily inferred from Fig. 4).\nTherefore, in either limiting case we would expect to see\nsmall variations in the backscatter power and in case 2, small\nvariations in the elevation angle (1\u25e6\u20132\u25e6).\nReferring to Figs. 2 and 3, we do not see much variation\nwith power at the further ranges, apart from that due to the\nerosion effect. However, elevation angles do appear to in-\ncrease by \u223c3\u25e6. This may again be evidence in favour of\ncase 2, but it is less convincing than before. At the nearer\nranges, there is also erosion of the artificial backscatter. This\nis not expected from our raytracing. Since the backscatter is\nnot eroded in this way on the lower frequencies, the effect\nmust be connected to the radar propagation, not the pump\npropagation. A similar effect is seen to happen with TID C.\nThe top panel of Fig. 7 presents the raytracing for 13-MHz\nradar frequency. It is immediately clear that the raised sec-\ntion of the UHR locus tends to lie in a region of defocussed\nPedersen rays which are far from orthogonality. As the TID\napproaches, the part of the UHR locus nearest to the radar\nis depressed in altitude towards the locus of radar orthogo-\nnality at \u223c195 km altitude. Thus, in either limiting case, the\nbackscatter power might be enhanced. This could explain\nthe localised enhancement seen in the 13.2 MHz backscat-\nter power in Fig. 2 as TID E approaches, and which was re-\nmarked on earlier. (A similar effect is seen at 15.1 MHz too).\nApart from this enhancement, the backscatter power does not\nseem obviously greater or lesser as the elevated part of the\nUHR locus passes over the pump transmitter. On the other\nhand, the elevation angles in Fig. 3 show a dramatic increase\nfrom about 6\u201322\u25e6. This might be sufficient to indicate that\nthe backscatter is coming from rays which achieve orthogo-\nnality in the topside ionosphere in the 240\u2013270 km altitude\ninterval. This would be more consistent with an assump-\ntion of longer, more aspect sensitive irregularities (case 1).\nIndeed, the irregularities would have to be detectable some\n10\u201320 km above the UHR altitude, even when the latter is\nat its highest. It would certainly be difficult to expect to\nsee significant backscatter returns along the rays in the de-\nfocussed region where the transition from ionospherically-\nreflected to ionospherically-penetrating rays occurs, since in\naddition to the defocussing, the rays are also far from or-\nthogonality. This conclusion is supported by the elevation\nangles exhibited by the ground backscatter, which typically\nshows angles of \u223c15\u25e6 at the edge of the skip zone compared\nto \u223c22\u25e6 for the artificial backscatter from the irregularities\nelevated by the TID. This implies that the artificial backscat-\nter must be coming from penetrating rays, not reflected ones.\nIf we suppose that case 2 above applies, we could estimate\nthe aspect sensitivity of the striations in terms of backscatter\npower variation per degree off-orthogonal as 10\/3\u22483 dB\/\u25e6,\nbased on the measured backscatter power variation associ-\nated with TIDs A and B and the aspect angle variation esti-\nmated from the raytracing in Fig. 6. This is rather less than\nthe estimate of at least 20 dB for 3\u25e6 off-orthogonal given by\nFialer (1974). Alternatively, if we suppose that case 1 ap-\nplies (ignoring the evidence from the elevation angles) we\ncould estimate the decay of backscatter power with altitude\nas 10\/10=1 dB km\u22121. This corresponds to a e-folding scale\nlength for the mean density perturbation \u30081N\u3009 of \u223c8 km.\nThis is within the range of previous estimates, but shorter\nthan those of Jones et al. (1984), Robinson (1989) and Se-\nnior et al. (2004).\nIt is difficult to separate the effects on the radar backscat-\nter power of the elongation of the irregularities and their\naspect-sensitivity. Nevertheless, our observations suggest\nthat the irregularities may not be as highly aspect-sensitive\nas previously supposed. This point requires further inves-\ntigation. Lower aspect-sensitivity could result from a con-\nsiderable amount of additional small-scale structure along\nthe magnetic field. Theoretical work (Antani and Guzdar,\n1999; Borisov, 2004) suggests that drift waves would be ex-\ncited by the high temperature and density gradients associ-\nated with the artificial irregularities. These drift waves have\nalready been suggested as a source of very small-scale field-\ntransverse structure observed in in-situ measurements (Kel-\nley et al., 1995; Kelley, 2004), although this is probably too\nweak to make a significant contribution to HF radar backscat-\nter. The turbulence associated with the drift waves would\nlead to additional structuring in the plasma along the mag-\nnetic field too, thus reducing aspect sensitivity. Whether this\nmight be sufficient to account for the observed aspect sen-\nsitivity is not clear. We can make an estimate of the lon-\ngitudinal scales required to explain the aspect sensitivity by\nconsidering that according to the Booker (1956) theory, for\nan aspect angle (off-orthogonal) of \u03b8 radians and a radar\nwavenumber k, the three-dimensional power spectrum of the\nirregularities must have a significant magnitude at a field-\nparallel wavenumber k\u2016\u22482k\u03b8 . Thus for an aspect angle of 3\u25e6\nand k=0.4 m\u22121 (18 MHz) we have k\u2016\u22480.04 m\u22121. This corre-\nsponds to a field-parallel wavelength of only 160 m. Taking\nAnn.

Senior et al.: Gravity wave disturbances in artificial HF radar backscatter 2359\ninto account the strong longitudinal diffusion, this scale is\nvery short and it is rather hard to believe that significant\nstructure could persist at such a scale.\nAnother possible explanation for reduced aspect sensitiv-\nity is that there could be significant multiple-scattering of the\nHF radar wave in the region of artificial irregularities. In such\na situation, although the \u201cindividual\u201d irregularities may re-\nmain highly aspect-sensitive, the power scattered in slightly\noff-orthogonal directions can be scattered again into direc-\ntions further from orthogonality and so on, resulting in re-\nduced aspect sensitivity in the backscatter received from the\nirregular region as a whole.\nWe should emphasise that our estimate of the aspect sensi-\ntivity leading to only a 10-dB reduction in backscatter power\nat 3\u25e6 off-orthogonal is based on the assumption of extremely\nshort irregularities so that there is no contribution to the\nbackscatter power from altitudes other than that of UHR.\nSince this is unlikely to be realistic, contributions from other\naltitudes will mitigate the fall in the contribution from the\nUHR altitude when viewing this altitude off orthogonality.\nIn this sense, our estimate is therefore a lower bound on the\naspect sensitivity and the irregularities may be more aspect-\nsensitive than it suggests.\nThe observations presented here rely on natural variations\nin the altitude of upper-hybrid resonance due to TIDs. In or-\nder to investigate how the altitude of irregularities affects HF\nradar observations more systematically, it would be possi-\nble to create controlled altitude variations by varying the HF\npump frequency so that the UHR altitude is varied. In this\nway, the uncertainty in the electron density distribution cre-\nated by the presence of TIDs and which limits the reliability\nwith which we can trace the radar propagation, is avoided. Of\ncourse, it is possible that varying the pump frequency might\nitself lead to differences in the characteristics of the irregu-\nlarities.\nFinally, it is worth noting that our raytracing simulations\nof the HF radar propagation show that, even in the case of the\nlarge amplitude TID E, the perturbations to the radar rays are\nnot too great. This is particularly true at 18 MHz where iono-\nspheric refraction is less than at 13 MHz. Thus, to a first ap-\nproximation, the effects of the TID on the radar propagation\ncan be ignored as far as artificial backscatter is concerned\nand the effect of the TID on the HF pump wave propagation\nis much more important. This means that the elevation angle\nvariations are not likely to be caused by the distortion of the\nradar propagation associated with the TID, but by changes in\nthe location of the target, as we have assumed up to now. Of\ncourse, the effect of a TID on the radar propagation is not\ninsignificant when considering the perturbations to the skip\ndistance.\n4 Conclusions\nBy comparing multi-instrument observations, we have iden-\ntified perturbations in the location and intensity of artificial\nHF radar backscatter as being caused by the passage of TIDs\nthrough the pumped volume of plasma. The presence of at-\nmospheric gravity wave-induced TIDs was inferred from the\nskip distance variation in the HF radar measurements and the\nelectron density perturbations measured by incoherent scat-\nter radar. A raytracing model of the HF pump wave prop-\nagation allows us to understand some of the HF radar phe-\nnomena in terms of the modification of the region of the\nionosphere in which the pump wave can reach the upper-\nhybrid resonance level where the irregularities are excited. In\nparticular we can understand the extensions of the artificial\nbackscatter region as being related to the increased altitude of\nUHR when the disturbance travels over the pump transmitter\nand an erosion of the poleward edge of the region as being\ndue to the pump being unable to access the UHR altitude in\nthat region. According to both data and modelling, these ef-\nfects become more pronounced as the amplitude of the TID\n(in terms of relative electron density perturbation) increases.\nWe can see that it is possible to determine from the artifi-\ncial backscatter observations alone, the period and the line-\nof-sight phase speed component of the TID and therefore the\nhorizontal wavelength. Furthermore, with the aid of a ray-\ntracing model, it would be possible to estimate the TID am-\nplitude and vertical wavelength by fitting the model to the\nobservations. In this way, observations of TIDs in artifi-\ncial backscatter can be used to support observations based\non ground scatter skip distance variations. The artificial ir-\nregularities are in-situ tracers of the ionospheric distortions\ncaused by a TID and thus represent a more direct means of\naccessing TID parameters than inverting ground scatter mea-\nsurements.\nAs for the irregularities themselves, our observations, par-\nticularly the elevation angle variations, suggest that off-\northogonal scattering may be important. Thus the assump-\ntion of near-infinite aspect sensitivity may not always be jus-\ntified. This means that the results of analyses like those car-\nried out by Senior et al. (2004) must be treated with some\ncaution, but equally our conclusions here are subject to some\ndoubt over the accuracy of the elevation angles measured.\nThe aspect-sensitivity of the irregularities is an indicator of\ntheir small-scale field-parallel structure, which could arise\nfrom the dynamic equilibrium between growth from the heat-\ning caused by upper-hybrid waves and their destruction by,\nfor example, drift waves excited by the field-transverse tem-\nperature and density gradients. We have suggested that the\naspect-sensitivity should be investigated further by carrying\nout experiments in which the height of the irregularities is\nvaried in a controlled manner by varying the HF pump fre-\nquency.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/2347\/2006\/ Ann.
