For a number \nof years decision analysis has been part of the social work curriculum at the \nUniversity of Lincoln, which is one of sixty-eight universities in England to be \naccredited by the General Social Care Council (GSCC) to provide social work \ndegrees. Introducing the use of decision analysis during the univbrsity's pre- \nregistration training is thought to have the advantage of giving early familiarity with \nthis important developing area. The Decision Making and Risk module introduces \nstudents to a critical use of decision analysis as a practical tool in uncertain practice \nsituations, when there is time to carry out such an analysis and the decision warrants \nthe time invested. The teaching is based on the developmental work carried out at \nthe university into the use of decision analysis in social work and published work in \nthe fields of business (Goodwin and Wright, 1998), nursing (Thompson and Dowding, \n2001), medicine (Hunink and Glasziou, 2001) and social work (O'Sullivan, 1999; \nMunro, 2002). Decision analysis shows the potential of being a useful tool, however, \nthere is no known published empirical research into its actual use by social workers \nin social work practice situations, although it is explained in O'Sullivan (1999:127-39) \nand Munro (2002: 1 17-40). \nThe first section of the article will give the context of learning and teaching decision \nanalysis on a social work course. The second will report the findings and finally the \nthird section will discuss the implications of the findings and comes to some \nconclusions. \nLearninq and Teachinq Decision Analysis \nDecision analysis is a way of comparing options in terms of the balance between the \nchances of good and bad outcomes occurring and the amount of benefit and harm \nassociated with the possible outcomes. The use of decision analysis to help make a \ndecision involves the following steps. \n1. Constructing a decision tree that includes, identifying options, paths events \nmight take and possible outcomes of these paths. \n2. Estimating the probability of events taking a particular path. \n3. Giving a numerical score to the possible outcomes of the various paths. \n4. Calculating the expected utility of each option, a number that combines the \nprobability of events taking particular paths and the value of the outcomes of \nthese paths. \n5. Identifying the option with the highest expected utility value as giving the best \nchance of a good outcome. \nUsing decision analysis to assist making decisions is thought to have a number of \nbenefits (Munro, 2002:117; Thompson and Dowding, 2001:142; Hunink and \nGlasziou, 2001:24) including helping decision makers to: \nThink about and identify options in a clear and explicit way. \nIdentify paths events might take and their possible outcomes. \nConsider the factors that may influence chances of 'events taking a particular \npath and make judgements about probabilities. \nMake judgements about relative benefit and harm. \nCombine the chance and magnitude elements of uncertainty into a single \nfigure. \nDecide which option gives the best chance of a good outcome. \nCertain requirements may also create limitations in its use, including: \nThe time required to carry out the analysis. \nThe amount and quality of thinking required to structure the decision. \nThe reasoning skills required to make valid judgements. \nThe need to accurately carry out the relatively straightforward mathematical \noperations. \nThe Decision Making and Risk Module \nDecision Making and Risk is a Level Two Module of the BSc (Hons) Social Work \nDegree that students undertake before their Final Placement. The module puts \nforward a practical and critical approach to the use of decision analysis in practice \nsituations. There are two broad strands to the use of decision analysis, developing \nstandardised protocols that provide recommended pathways for practitioners\/service \nusers to follow (see Tavakoli et al, 2000) and the practitionerlservice user use of \ndecision analysis to help decide what to do in particular situations. The module \nteaching concerned the latter and students are shown how to, construct a decision \ntree; estimate probabilities and score possible outcomes; and calculate the expected \nutility value of each option. Decision trees can get very complex (for example see, \nMunro, 2002: 119) and are in danger of becoming \"a tangled thicket\" (Lanza and \nBantly, 1991:65). As a consequence emphasis is given to the construction and use \nof relatively simple decision trees like the one given in Figure 1. Such relatively \nsimple decision trees can still bring clarity and coherence to decision making while \nstudents are in a better position to learn the basic principles involved. A particular \nemphasis is placed on the potential to help service users make informed life \ndecisions and case studies are used in lectures, workshops and assignments to \nillustrate and give students practice in using decision analysis in practice situations. \n[Fig. 1 Decision Tree] \nWebb (2002:51) refers to decision analysis as a \"rapidly expanding and highly \ncontroversial\" field. One source of controversy is the quantification of chance and \nvalue in practice, and the choices that have to be made as to how to present these \nissues to students. There are subjectivist and objectivist perspectives on probability; \nthe former sees probability as a 'mental construct' and the latter as a property of the \n'real world' (Dowie, 1992:36). Probability within the so-called objective view is based \non the frequency with which events are likely to occur in a long run. However, even \nin a discipline such as medicine, in which some reliable success rates exist for \ncertain medical procedures, it has been argued that, \n\"Objective frequential probability, [. . .] does not translate smoothly to \nsubjective probability, and it is subjective probability that clinicians use in \npractice.\" (Little, 1995:63) \nThe module puts forward a subjectivist or \"personal theory\" (Baron, 2000:99) \napproach to probability on the basis that there can be no \"objective\" probability of \nunique events. Subjectivists are willing to take account of frequency counts from the \npast where they exist, but believe it is not possible to routinely take an actuarial \napproach to probabilities in social work (Kemshall, 1992: 135-7: Munro, 2002:124: \nO'Sullivan, 1999:137). The argument is that decision makers inevitability base their \njudgements on their knowledge and beliefs, and that this is better done in an explicit \nway so as to be available for scrutiny of self and others (O'Sullivan, 2005229-31). \nTo help form their judgements, students are encouraged to carry out a careful \nanalysis of a decision situation and explicitly identify predictive factors combining \ntheir own judgement with available research findings. Students are alerted to the \nsystematic bias that research has shown that human beings can be prone to \n(Tversky and Kahneman, 1982) and the need to critically examine the reasons for \ntheir beliefs about probability. \nPotentially equally problematic is the assigning of a numerical score to possible \noutcomes. For example, practitioner scores can be very different from service users \nscores (Thompson and Dowding, 2001 :136). For the sake of clarity the discussion \nshall proceed on the basis of social workers and service users making joint \ndecisions, although, levels of service user involvement (O'Sullivan, 1999:43) and \nroles of social workers (Ibid, 1999:14) vary depending on the circumstances. Using a \nten-point scale, the score of each possible outcome is negotiated, depending on how \ndesirable or undesirable the outcomes are considered to be. The number of points \nbetween the possible outcomes is checked to see if these accurately reflect beliefs \nabout the differential impact of those outcomes and their relative value. A sensitivity \nanalysis (Oakshott, 1993:83; Hunink and Glasziou, 2001:70) is carried out to see if \nrelatively small changes in probability and value scores change the option that has \nthe highest expected utility. \nThe form of decision analysis put forward in the module represents a judgement- \nbased approach to practice combined with what Trinder (2000:142-3) identifies as \nthe pragmatic approach to evidence-based practice. Webb (2002) discusses how \ndecision analysis is a potential way to implement evidence based practice and \nargues that \"practice-based evidence . . . should be regarded as a complementary \ndimension to evidence based practice\" (lbid:59). He goes on to state that decision \nanalysis \"seeks to determine explicitly the preferences and biases of the decision \nmaker and the uncertainties associated with the decision\" (lbid:53) and adds that it \ncan be criticised as being \"a mathematical confirmation of the bias that already pre- \nexisted the process of decision construction\" (lbid:55). \nIt is not claimed that decision analysis eradicates or even reduces uncertainty nor is it \nintended to replace human judgements based on careful assessment and analysis. \nThe module's approach explicitly recognises, White and Stancombe's (2003: 1 1 ) \npoint, \"that statistical reasoning itself requires judgements\". The method potentially \nprovides a framework for using judgements in an explicit and organised way to \nrender decision making more transparent and systematic. As such it increases the \nchances that actions are consistent with the decision maker's beliefs and values and \nis a practical way of implementing any relevant research evidence that is available. \nCritical Stance \nAs well as being expected to carry out decision analysis and use critical reasoning \nskills, students are encouraged to adopt a critical stance towards the use of decision \nanalysis in social work. The term 'critical' is a contested concept used in a number of \nways in higher education (Barnett, 1997) and is often used without explanation. In \nthe context of this research the term 'critical stance' is used to denote a questioning, \nreflexive and thoughtful attitude towards the use of decision analysis in practice. \nFor the purpose of this research a six-category framework for analysing student \nstance was constructed and given in Figure 2. The aim of the module is to get \nstudents to critically consider the use of decision analysis as an aid to making \ndecisions in social work. All three attitudes in the critical column are given equal \nstatus as acceptable learning outcomes, whether, critical acceptance, critical \nrejection or critically undecided. In the non-critical column, there is likely to be most \nconcern about \"non-critical acceptance\", and a particular interest in how many, if any, \nstudents display this disposition towards decision analysis. The specific allocation of \nrespondents to one of the six categories proved to be beyond the scope of this \nresearch. \nFig. 2 Student Stance Towards the Use of Decision Analysis \nAccepting \nRejecting \ncritical \nCritical acceptance \nCritical rejection \nnon-critical \nNon-critical acceptance \nNon- critical rejection \nThe module teaching content put forward, implicitly, if not explicitly, a provisional \ncritical acceptance of decision analysis as a potentially useful practice tool. This \ncritically accepting stance is regarded as a necessary prerequisite for using decision \nanalysis on placement. For the purpose of this research, critical acceptance was \nassociated with decision makers: \nnot becoming over confident about the result of the analysis, it being only as \nvalid as the judgements and figures used. \nnot becoming seduced by the seemingly objective scientific appearance. \nrecognising the need for having clear and valid reasons for probability \nestimates and value scores. \nrecognising sources of bias and the need for reflexivity in relation to values \nand beliefs. \nHave not thought about it No opinion \nAnd recognising and appreciating the potential of decision analysis to: \nCritically undecided \nimprove clarity of thinking and promote a systematic approach; \nenable the reasoning behind decisions to be scrutinised by service users and \nother stakeholders. \nincrease critical awareness of own thinking and reasoning; \nrecord how decisions were made to aid future accountability \nModule Assessment \nStudents completed a written coursework assignment that involved calculating the \nexpected utility value of each option in a case study. They are expected to be \nreflexive and carry out critical reasoning at each stage. Firstly, by justifying their \nprobability estimates and numerical scores for possible outcomes and critically \nassessing their validity and the forms of biases that might be operating. Secondly, by \nconstructing an argument as to which is the best option and giving the reasons for \ntheir conclusion including identifying and assessing counterarguments. This widens \nthe analysis beyond choosing the option that gives the best chance of a good \noutcome, to include, for example, implications of the options for autonomy and justice \n(Thomson, 1999:98). The best assignments demonstrate well-developed critical \nreasoning skills, by giving a coherent argument as to which is the best option. This \ninvolves the students giving clear reasons for their conclusion and why counter \narguments were rejected. Members of the module team assessed assignments \nagainst set assessment criteria that students received in advanced. \nThe standard of work in assignments shows the vast majority of students were \ncompetent in using of decision analysis in relation to a case scenario. The \nexceptions were a small number of students who make basic and significant errors in \ncarrying out decision analysis, for example, probabilities not adding up to one, \narithmetical errors, failure to give reasons for probability estimates and value scores. \nFor example, the probabilities of the possible outcomes of an option not adding up to \none, is a violation of a fundamental rule of probability as a mathematical system \n(Baron, 2000:104). There is also a larger group of students who do not clearly \ndemonstrate the ability to construct a reasoned argument. This maybe unsurprising \nin the context of Kuhn's (1991:4) claim that the average person does not possess \ncognitive skills of argument and there are indications that some social workers lack, \nor are not using, a capacity to construct valid arguments (O'Sullivan, 2004:8-9). \nUsing Decision Analysis on Placement \nDecision analysis has the potential to help students meet The National Occupational \nStandards for Social Work (Topss UK Partnerships, 2002), which students have to \ndemonstrate while on placement. In particular, decision analysis can potentially \nassist students to: help service users make informed decisions; assess options; \nassess risk; prepare for decision making forums; enable service users to be involved \nin decision making forums; and provide evidence for decisions and justify decisions. \nTo date the module teaching has not been systemically extended to the student \nplacements. It is not uncommon in social work education for theories and processes \nto be taught as useful practice tools that students may or may not use on placement, \ndepending on the choices of students and practice assessors and the nature of the \npractice settings they find themselves in. In the absence of evidence that decision \nanalysis is a widespread tool used within social work, research is necessary to help \nshow the way forward for extending the learning and teaching of decision analysis in \npractice situations. \nMethod \nIn 2005, when the Decision Making and Risk module assessment and student \nevaluations were completed, questionnaires were sent to the recorded address of \nsixty-six students enrolled on the Year 2 of the BSc (Hons) Social Work. Just over \neighty percent of this cohort was female, just over sixty percent was over twenty-four \nyears old and just under ninety percent white British or white Irish. Twenty-seven of \n66 students completed and returned their questionnaires giving a response rate of \n41 %. A accompanying letter explained how the questionnaire was part of a research \nproject into the potential use of decision analysis in social work and was separate \nfrom the module assessment or module evaluation. The questionnaire consisted of \ntwelve fixed-choice questions and one open question and was to be completed \nanonymously. Ethical approval for the research was gained through University of \nLincoln's School of Health and Social Care Ethics Committee. \nThe method adopted, although having some advantages, is subject to a number of \nsignificant limitations. It cannot be ruled out that the sample was subject to an \nunknown systematic bias in terms of who returned the questionnaire and the \nresearch is best regarded as a case study of these 27 students. While, fixed-choice \nquestions have the advantage of responses being easier to analyse, they have the \nlimitation of restricting and to some degree shaping the replies of the respondents \n(Robson, 2002:274). Likewise, self-completion questionnaires have the advantage of \nremoving potential interviewer effects but the disadvantage of not being able to probe \nrespondents for the factors influencing their responses (Ibid, 2002:252). Despite \nthese limitations, it was hoped that the research would shed some light on how \nstudents viewed the use of decision analysis. Responses to the questions will be \nconsidered under the headings: \nDecision analysis and its component parts \nDecision analysis as a practice tool \nUsing decision analysis on placement \nDecision Analysis and its Component Parts \nStudents were asked questions about the five steps of decision analysis which were \ngiven earlier. \nOrder of Difficulty of the Component Parts \nStudents were asked to place the five steps of decision analysis in the rank order 1- \n5, giving 1 to the easiest and 5 to the most difficult. Seventeen of the 27 respondents \nranked the five steps 1 to 5 as requested. There was no agreement as to the rank \norder of the five steps, however, there was a tendency for the second and third steps \nto be ranked hardest (with average rank positions of 3.88 and 3.58), the first and fifth \nsteps the easiest (both with average rank positions of 2.35) and the fourth step being \nplaced in the middle (rank average position 2.82). The second and third steps \ninvolve estimating the probability of events taking a particular path and giving a \nnumerical score to the possible outcome of the various paths. The tendency to rank \nthese as the most difficult could be interpreted as indicating some success in \npromoting a critical stance towards decision analysis. A non-critical acceptance \nwould see these as relatively easy steps, only requiring the numbers to be \"plucked \nout of the air\". \nHow straightforward is decision analysis? \nThe students were asked how straightforward they found decision analysis. All but \ntwo of the respondents (25) felt that decision analysis was relatively straightforward \nor very straightforward to carry out. The remaining two felt that decision analysis was \nnot straightforward. \nAttitude to estimating probabilities \nFor the purpose of the research, five common criticisms of the module's approach to \nestimating probabilities and five corresponding supportive statements were \nconstructed. Students were asked to choose between the corresponding critical and \nsupportive statements. Ticking three or more of the supportive statements was taken \nto indicate a positive attitude to this aspect of decision analysis. \nTwenty of respondents ticked three or more of the supportive statements. Four \nrespondents indicated a negative disposition towards this aspect of decision analysis \nby ticking three or more of the common criticisms. The remaining three respondents \nticked less than three of either set of statements. \nFig. 3 Module's Approach to Estimating Probabilities \nAttitude to assigning a numerical score to possible outcomes \nCommon Criticisms \nrelies too heavily on decision makers \nhaving valid reasons for their estimates \nis little more than guessing \nrequires research evidence that is \nusually absent \nrelies too heavily on the decision makers' \nsubjective beliefs \nis prone to systematic human bias \n- \nStudents were asked to choose between three common criticisms of the module's \napproach to scoring possible outcomes and three corresponding statements \nsupporting the approach taken. Ticking two or more of the supportive statements \nwas taken to indicate a positive attitude to this aspect of decision analysis. \nSupportive Statements \nencourages decision makers to have \nvalid reasons for their estimates \nenables beliefs about what will probably \nhappen to be critically examined \nencourages decision makers to seek out \nand use what research evidence there is \nhelps decision makers to be more critical \nabout their beliefs \nallows systematic bias to be partially \novercome through reflexivity \nSeventeen of the respondents were supportive of the scoring of possible outcomes \nwhile six showed concerns about this process. The four remaining respondents \nticked less than two of either set of statements. The numbers are too small to be \nsignificant but it is interesting to note that more respondents were concerned about \nthe scoring of possible outcomes than estimating probabilities. \nFig. 4 Module's Approach to Scoring Possible Outcomes \nThe Expected Utility Value \nCommon Criticisms \nis an arbitrary process \nis too reliant on decision makers having \nclear reasons for their scores \nrelies on decision makers carrying out a \nsensitivity analysis in relation to the \nscores given \nStudents were asked about how decision makers should regard the calculated \nexpected utility values of the options. All but one of the respondents (26) felt the \noption with the highest utility value was a useful guide or one of a number of factors \nto be taken into account when deciding which is the best option. No students \nbelieved that the option with the highest expected utility value should be \nautomatically chosen or that it should have no influence on choice of option. One \nrespondent gave no answer. \nSupportive Statement \nis a valid process that makes explicit the \ndecision maker's values \nallows the reasons for giving an outcome \na particular numerical score to be \nscrutinised \nhas the safeguard of sensitivity analysis \nSummarising the respondents' views on the component parts of decision analysis, in \ngeneral, they regarded it to be relatively straightforward to carry out and accepted the \nneed to make judgements and to carry out the mathematics. A minority of \nrespondents expressed some concern about estimating probabilities and scoring the \nimpact of possible outcomes. There were some indications that the respondents had \na critical stance towards the making of these judgements and carrying out the \nmathematics. \nDecision Analysis as a Practice Tool \nStudents were asked their views on social workers using decision analysis in practice \nsituations. \nUsefulness of Decision Analysis \nStudents were asked about the usefulness of decision analysis in actual practice. \nThe vast majority of the respondents (25) felt that it was either 'definitely a useful \npractice tool' or 'in some ways a useful practice tool'. One respondent felt that it was \ndefinitely not a useful practice tool and one respondent give no answer. \nDecision Analysis and Service User Involvement \nThere is no agreement amongst the respondents about the likely impact of decision \nanalysis on service user involvement with less than half (12) believing it would help. \nSeven felt decision analysis would hinder service user involvement and seven that it \nneither helps nor hinders. One gave a qualified answer that was difficult to interpret. \nAmount of Care Required \nThe students were asked their views on the amount of care that decision analysis \nrequires in practice. Decision analysis can be incorrectly used in the sense that \nmathematical principles are not followed and\/or insufficient care is given to the \nestimation of probabilities and scoring of outcomes. This raises the issue of whether \nthe use decision analysis in practice situations needs the same amount of care as \nany other theory in social work or whether it needs extra care being particularly prone \nto incorrect use. Just under half the respondents (1 3) felt that decision analysis did \nrequire extra care. Eleven felt that it required the usual amount of care, one that it \nrequired too much care and two expressed no opinion. \nCritical Acceptance of Decision Analysis \nStudents were asked whether they agreed, disagreed or had no opinion about six \nstatements that reflected the critical acceptance stance encouraged in the module. \nDisagreeing or having no opinion was taken to indicate the students took a different \nview on the use of decision analysis in practice. The six statements were: \n1. There is a danger that decision makers place too much confidence in decision \nanalysis. \n2. There is a danger that clients and other stakeholders are seduced by the \nseemingly objective scientific appearance of decision analysis. \n3. When using decision analysis decision makers should always have clear and \nvalid reasons for their probability estimates and value scores. \n4. Constructing a decision tree helps decision makers think more clearly and \nsystematically. \n5. Decision analysis can potentially enable stakeholders, including service users \nto assess the thinking behind decisions. \n6. Decision analysis helps decision makers be more critically aware of their own \nthinking. \nTicking agreement to four or more statements was taken to indicate a critical \nacceptance of the use of decision analysis in social work practice. About three \nquarters of the respondents (21) ticked four or more statements. Four agreed with \nthree statements and two expressed no opinion. \nThe Use of Decision Analysis in Social Work \nStudents were asked if they had any general comments on the use of decision \nanalysis in social work. Fourteen respondents took the opportunity to give additional \ncomments. Ten of these gave general or qualified support to the use of decision \nanalysis in social work, while four expressed objections, one of which were strong \nobjections. As an example, one of the supportive respondents stated that, \n\"I found the decision tree a very useful tool to help me analyse the best option \nas it made me critically look at all the options available and the way situations \ncan improve and deteriorate. Although it was quite difficult to understand \ninitially a few attempts later its okay.\" \nThe respondent who gave the strongest objections stated that, \n\"I think that decision trees are so intricate that it would alienate service users \nand be unhelpful for participation. I think they are too long and complicated \nfor practice and not simple enough to do in partnership with a service user. \nIt's very critical of me to say but I think they are a waste of time.\" \nSummarising the respondents' views on decision analysis as a practice tool in social \nwork, all but two felt it would be potentially useful in practice. Opinion was more \ndivided as to whether it hindered or helped service user involvement with less than \nhalf the respondents feeling that it would help. Just under half the respondents felt \nthe decision analysis needed more care in its application than other theories and \nabout three-quarters indicated a critical accepting attitude towards its use. In the \nopen question, ten respondents gave support to the use of decision analysis in social \nwork. Four respondents expressed objections. \nDecision Analysis on Placement \nThree questions asked students about their views towards using decision analysis on \ntheir final placement. \nLevel of Confidence \nStudents were asked about their level of confidence in being able to use decision \nanalysis on placement. Over half the respondents (15) felt they needed no extra help \nto use decision analysis on their placement. A total of twelve respondents felt they \nneeded varying degrees of help. Five needed extra university training, four needed a \nlot of help from their practice assessor, while three needed both extra university \ntraining and a lot of help from their practice assessor. \nPractice Assessor's Knowledge of Decision Analysis \nStudents were asked if they expected their practice assessor to be familiar with \ndecision analysis. A third of the respondents (9) expected that their practice \nassessor would be familiar with decision analysis, while eight expected them to have \nno familiarity. Eight had no particular expectation and two respondents' answers \nwere difficult to interpret. \nUsing Decision Analysis on Placement \nStudents were asked whether they would use decision analysis on placement and \nthe degree to which this depended on the attitude of their practice assessor. The \nmajority of respondents (22) would use decision analysis while on placement if their \npractice assessors had no strong objection or showed an interest. Four would only \nuse decision analysis if required by their practice assessor; the remaining respondent \nwould do so if their practice assessor suggested it. \nSummarising the respondents' views of using decision analysis on their placement, \nover half felt they needed no extra help while those remaining felt they needed \nvarying degrees of additional help. A third expected their practice assessor to be \nfamiliar with decision analysis. Five would need their practice assessor to take the \ninitiative by suggesting or requiring them to use it. \nThe same group of students were asked to complete a short questionnaire on a \n\"recall day\" towards the end of their final placement. Sixteen of the thirty-four \nstudents who completed the questionnaire stated that they had thought about using \ndecision analysis, however, only three had gone on to discuss this with their practice \nassessor. By far the most common reason for not discussing it with their practice \nassessor was that they were not sure whether it was relevant to particular situations \nand would prefer their practice assessor to suggest it. The reasons given by the \nthree students, who did not go on to use decision analysis after discussing it with \ntheir practice assessors, were lack of sufficient knowledge or relevance to particular \ncases. The nineteen who didn't think about using decision analysis thought the \nreasons were that they had no time to analyse (I), placement had other methods in \nplace (I), practice assessor never suggested it (I), they did not make a connection \nwith their placement (Z) ,  didn't understand it sufficiently (3) or that it did not occur to \nthem that it could be relevant (1 1). None of the thirty-four students actually used \ndecision analysis while on placement, although one student stated they would use it \nin the remainder of the placement having forgotten about it in the midst of all the \ninformation they receive. \nDiscussion \nThe vast majority of respondents found decision analysis relatively straightforward to \ncarry out and most took a critically supportive approach to its use in social work. In \naddition, most of the respondents were happy to use decision analysis on placement, \nif support was available and it was thought to be appropriate to do so. The major \nareas of disagreement among the respondents were whether decision analysis would \nhelp or hinder service user involvement and whether it requires more care than other \napproaches to decision making. From the student performance in the Decision \nMaking and Risk module the majority of students are basically competent in the use \nof decision analysis in relation to a case study, while a small minority made mistakes \nand a larger number were not using the necessary reasoning skills. \nThere are a number of possible explanations why a general support for decision \nanalysis as a useful practice tool on completion of a university module changed to a \nsubsequent reluctance to discuss its use with practice assessors. Students on the \nsocial work degree spend half their time in the university and half their time on \nplacement. Sometime ago Barbour (1984) argued that the so called 'tandem model' \nof social work education was a barrier to integration of theory and practice as it \ninvolves students moving back and forth between the academic setting of university \neducation and the apprentice model of practice settings. Currently, in the absence of \nthe detail of what students have learnt at the university, practice assessors have to \nrely on what their students tell them. For one reason or another most of the sixteen \nrespondents who thought about using decision analysis on their placements choose \nnot to discuss its use with their practice assessor. The students appeared to lack the \nconfidence to raise the issue. \nThe research suggests that a more proactive approach to connecting 'classroom' and \n'field' is needed, if students are to be given the opportunity to use decision analysis \non their placements. The proportion of practice assessors willing to include decision \nanalysis in what they teach and assess is unknown. It might depend on how relevant \nand practical they consider decision analysis to be in relation to their own practice \nand in helping students meet the National Occupational Standards (Topss UK \nPartnerships, 2002). Clarke (2002:461) found that care managers regarded a \nparticular model of risk assessment taught on a training programme to be far too time \nconsuming and complicated to use, given the demands on their time and heavy \nworkloads. This was particularly in relation to scoring possible outcomes and \nestimating probabilities, features shared with decision analysis. There are a number \nof other unknowns in relation to the practice assessors, including, how many are \nalready familiar with decision analysis, how do they view decision analysis and how \nwould they react to the university providing opportunities to learn more about \ndecision analysis. \nA hypothesis is that practice assessors would have confidence in students who \neither, use decision analysis in a competent and critical way or demonstrate their \ndecision making skills in other ways. That concerns would be in relation to the small \nnumber of students who make mistakes or display a non-critical acceptance. There \nmay also be a more general concern about the larger group of students who fall short \nof being able to demonstrate the critical reasoning skills required to construct valid \nand well-reasoned arguments. \nConclusion \nThe results of the module assessment and this research have demonstrated that the \nlearning and teaching of decision analysis has been generally effective within the \nnarrow confines of the university. Nevertheless four areas need further attention if \n'classroom' and 'field' are to be effectively connected; namely, mathematical errors; \ncritical reasoning; service user involvement; and the practiceltheory interface. These \nareas reverberate far beyond the use of decision analysis and are rooted in issues \naffecting the whole of social work education and further a field. \nWays need to be found to enable a minority of students to stop making mathematical \nerrors. It is open to question whether these students are not taking sufficient care or \nlack basic mathematical skills or knowledge. In relation to critical thinking skills, \nthese are receiving more attention in social work education (for example see, Ford et \nat, 2004: Heron, 2006: Gray and McDonald, 2006). Nevertheless, there is a \ntendency in undergraduate higher education to restrict learning and teaching to the \nevaluation of the arguments of others. If Osmo and Landau (2001) are right that \nethical decision making requires explicit argumentation, there needs to be more \nemphasis given to students constructing their own arguments, as in Cottrell \n(2005: 167-82). \nAt present it is a matter of theoretical speculation whether the use of decision \nanalysis helps or hinders service user involvement. Webb (200254) argues that, \n\"A consumer-led and service-user perspective suggests that decision \nanalysis can lead to greater transparency of practice. Service users will \nincreasingly be able to monitor the process involved. Social workers may be \nrequired to provide detailed pathways to service users showing why various \ndecisions were reached at different times of the process.\" \nDecision analysis has the potential to increase service user involvement by rendering \nhow decisions are made more open to scrutiny, however, some students felt that \nservice users would be mystified and overawed by the process. Only further \nresearch will shed light on how service users view decision analysis and whether \nthey feel it helps make informed decisions. \nDecision analysis has the potential to be put alongside other ways practice assessors \ncan enable students to connect theory with practice (for examples see, Cartney, \n2004; Collingwood, 2005; Fisher and Somerton, 2000; Noble, 2001). Both Cartney \n(2004:52) and Clapton et al. (2006:653) identify a challenge for the profession as \nbeing how to support the role of practice assessor and developing a more supportive \nrelationship between academic learning and practice. Currently the potential of \ndecision analysis to help practice assessors enable students take a more systematic \napproach to demonstrating The National Occupational Standards for Social Work \n(Topss U K  Partnerships, 2002) is not being realised or tested. As Noble (2001:348) \nhas argued practice assessors are, \n\"Often marginalized by the university in the curriculum development and \nscholarship enterprise [and] are mostly left to their own devices in the \nteaching and fostering of professional skills and the theory practice link.\" \nThis research suggests that before students use decision analysis on placements, a \nnumber of further steps need to be taken, including, enabling students to take more \ncare with the mathematics, more emphasis on students being able to construct valid \narguments, consulting with service users on the use of decision analysis and \nproviding practice assessors the opportunity to learn about decision analysis. With \nthese additional measures in place further research needs to be carried out in \npartnership with service users, practice assessors and students to ascertain the \nimpact of students using decision analysis in actual practice situations. \nCurrently research is planned in the form of a small-scale action research project \ninvolving a sample of social work students on placement. This will set out to \ninvestigate whether practice assessors find knowledge of decision analysis of \npractical relevance in enabling students be more analytical in relation to decision \nmaking. The research will ascertain how students, practice assessors and service \nusers respond to the opportunity to the use of decision analysis, particularly whether \nthey find it helps or hinders: service user involvement; the making of informed \ndecisions; and engagement in critical reasoning. The findings of the action research \nproject will be used to review how the university and practice placements connect \nwith each other as sites of learning and teaching decision analysis. \nReferences \nBarbour, R.
