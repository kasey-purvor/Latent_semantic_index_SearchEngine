OPVs are based on junctions between\nelectron accepting and electron donating molecules, at which\nphotoinduced excitons formed in both materials are dissoci-\nated to form free charge carriers. OPVs can be broadly cat-\negorized into two groups according to whether the photoac-\ntive component comprises two discrete layers of donor and\nacceptor molecules \u0001bilayer\u0002 or a complex interpenetrating\nnetwork \u0001bulk heterojunction\u0002. To date, both bilayer and\nbulk-heterojunction OPVs have achieved power conversion\nefficiencies \u0001\u0001p\u0002 of 4%\u20135% under 1 sun simulated solar\nillumination2\u20135 which is considered to be half that required\nfor market entry today. Furthermore, neither approach has a\nclear lead in the race to achieve commercial viability as yet.\nTo improve the performance of OPVs, the open circuit\nvoltage \u0001Voc\u0002, short circuit current density \u0001Jsc\u0002, and fill fac-\ntor must all be optimized. Hence, it is essential to understand\nhow these parameters relate to the fundamental physical pro-\ncesses of light absorption, exciton dissociation, charge car-\nrier transport, and extraction to the external circuit. While the\nfactors affecting Voc are still the subject of debate,6\u20139 it is\ngenerally accepted that the maximum attainable Voc in het-\nerojunction OPV is determined by the difference in potential\nbetween electrons in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital\n\u0001LUMO\u0002 of the acceptor material and the highest occupied\nmolecular orbital \u0001HOMO\u0002 of the donor material. Further-\nmore, the maximum Voc is only achieved when photogener-\nated free charge carriers are extracted to the external circuit\nby the electrodes having Fermi levels aligned with these mo-\nlecular orbital energies. Employing electrodes having a dif-\nference in work function greater than the donor HOMO\u2013\nacceptor LUMO offset in an attempt to increase the built-in\nelectric field is counterproductive, since free carriers have to\nsurmount barriers to be extracted to the external circuit. The\ncomplexity of many metal-organic interfaces makes achiev-\ning optimal energy level alignment and predicting Voc based\non the work function of the pristine electrodes problematic.10\nThis letter reports the photoresponse of reversed discrete\nheterojunction OPV based on pentacene\/C60 heterojunctions.\nTo investigate the wider applicability of this study, reverse\ncell structures employing the soluble C60 derivative \u00036,6\u0004-\nphenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester \u0001PCBM\u0002 in place of\nC60 was also investigated and found to exhibit similar char-\nacteristics. Consequently, in the interests of conciseness, only\nthe former is present herein with experimental results for\nthe later included in the accompanying supplementary\ninformation.11\nTwice sublimed pentacene \u000199.99%\u0002 was purchased from\nH.W. Sands. C60 \u000199.99%\u0002 and PCBM were purchased from\nAmerican Dye Source and Solenne, respectively. All organic\nmaterials were used as received. Devices were fabricated on\nindium tin oxide \u0001ITO\u0002 coated glass cleaned using a three\nstage ultrasonic bath treatment in toluene, an aqueous surfac-\ntant solution, and acetone. Immediately prior to use, the ITO\nsubstrates were suspended in the vapor of refluxing acetone\nfollowed by microwave oxygen plasma treatment. Discrete\nheterojunction OPVs were fabricated by subliming penta-\ncene and C60 under high vacuum at a deposition rate of\n\u00050.1 nm s\u22121 onto precleaned ITO glass substrates. Metal\ncounterelectrodes to a 50 nm thickness were deposited at\n\u00050.5 nm s\u22121 using a shadow mask without breaking vacuum.\nCurrent-voltage \u0001J-V\u0002 measurements were performed using\n100 mW cm\u22122 AM1.5 simulated solar irradiation.\nThe J-V characteristics of ITO\/pentacene \u000145 nm\u0002 \/C60\n\u000150 nm\u0002 \/Al \u0001normal\u0002 and the ITO\/C60 \u000150 nm\u0002\/pentacene\n\u000150 nm\u0002 \/Al \u0001reversed\u0002 devices are shown in Fig. 1.

The Voc of\nthe normal cell structure \u0001\u00050.4 V\u0002 is in good agreement with\nthe difference in energy between the LUMO of C60 \u00014.5 eV\u0002\nand HOMO of pentacene \u00014.9 eV\u0002,14 consistent with the\nfindings of Brabec et al. for bulk-heterojunction OPVs.6 In\norder to rationalize the much larger Voc in the reversed cell\nstructure \u0001\u00050.7 eV\u0002, it is necessary to consider the difference\nin energy between the HOMO of C60 \u00016.1 eV\u0002 and LUMO of\npentacene \u00013.0 eV\u0002 since, based on the observed photore-\nsponse \u0001Fig. 1\u0002, electrons are extracted via the pentacene\nlayer and holes via the C60 layer in the reversed cell struc-\nture. It is likely that the measured Voc \u0001\u00050.7 V\u0002 is much\nsmaller than the maximum attainable Voc \u00013.1 V\u0002 owing to\nnonideal alignment between the electrode Fermi levels and\nthe relevant molecular orbitals in the adjacent organic layers.\nThe fill factors in the normal and reverse device structures\nare comparable, being 0.43 and 0.38, respectively.\nFigure 2\u0001c\u0002 depicts the operation of the normal device.15\nAbsorbed photons in the pentacene and C60 layers generate\nexcitons which diffuse toward the donor-acceptor interface.\nAt the interface, these excitons dissociate forming free elec-\ntrons and holes in the acceptor \u0001C60\u0002 and donor \u0001pentacene\u0002\nlayers, respectively. Free charge carriers drift toward the\nelectrodes assisted by the built-in electrical field between the\nelectrodes. This process of photocarrier generation forms the\nbasis of operation of OPV and results in a relatively large Jsc\n\u0001\u00053 mA cm\u22122\u0002. However, this process cannot account for\nphotocurrent generation in the reverse cell structure since the\nbarriers to electrons and holes reaching the respective elec-\ntrodes are prohibitively large \u00011.5 and 1.2 eV\u0002, respectively\n\u0003Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002\u0004. We propose the following explanation for the\nmechanism of photocurrent generation in the reverse cell\nstructure schematically illustrated in Fig. 2\u0001d\u0002: absorbed pho-\ntons generate excitons in both the pentacene and C60 layers.\nExcitons generated in the pentacene layer are dissociated at\nthe interface with the aluminium electrode, resulting in ex-\ntraction of an electron to the external circuit and leaving a\nhole in the pentacene HOMO which is swept to the organic\nheterojunction by the built-in electric field. Excitons gener-\nated in the C60 layer are dissociated at the interface with ITO\nelectrode resulting in extraction of a hole to the external\ncircuit and leaving an electron in the C60 LUMO which is\nswept to the organic heterojunction by the built-in electric\nfield. The resulting accumulation of both electrons and holes\nat the organic heterojunction is dissipated via recombination\nat the organic heterojunction.\nTo test the proposed mechanism, a 0.5 nm thick silver\nnanocluster layer was incorporated into the reverse cell struc-\nture by thermal evaporation at the pentacene-C60 interface to\nfacilitate enhanced recombination of accumulated electrons\nand holes,16 thereby increasing Jsc. The J-V characteristics of\nthis cell \u0001Fig. 3\u0002 exhibit a fivefold increase in the Jsc support-\ning the proposed mechanism of photocurrent generation. The\nshunt resistance of the reverse cell is reduced upon incorpo-\nration of Ag nanoclusters at the organic heterojunction owing\nto the increase susceptibility of these cell structures to fila-\nmentary shorting. Consequently, the fill factor is also reduced\nfrom 0.38 to 0.23. Furthermore, it is also clear from Fig. 3\nthat the cell series resistance is not significantly increased in\nthe reverse cell structure despite the relatively low mobility\nof electrons in pentacene17 and holes in C60.18 This is entirely\nconsistent with the proposed mechanism of photocurrent\ngeneration since these low mobility carriers do not have to\ntraverse the organic layers prior to extraction by the elec-\ntrodes.\nAt first glance, the low Jsc in reversed cell structures\nindicates that the proposed mechanism of photogenerated\ncarriers is inefficient as compared to the conventional mecha-\nnism of photocurrent generation at the organic heterojunc-\ntion. However, it is likely that in the reverse cell structure,\nthe process of free carrier generation at the organic hetero-\nFIG. 1.

Ag nano-\nclusters at the organic heterojunction act as recombination\ncenters thereby reducing the efficiency, with which free car-\nriers are generated via exciton dissociation at the organic\nheterojunction, consistent with the fivefold increase in Jsc\nupon incorporation of Ag nanoclusters. Furthermore, accord-\ning to the proposed mechanism, the magnitude of Jsc in the\nreversed cell is ultimately limited by the requirement for\nbalanced exciton formation and dissociation in the C60 and\npentacene layers such that charge neutrality at the hetero-\njunction is retained. Since the absorption coefficient of C60\n\u0001Ref. 19\u0002 is an order of magnitude below that of pentacene,20\nJsc is expected to be limited by weak absorption in the C60\nlayer. The Jsc, in the reversed cell structure results in a power\nconversion efficiency of 0.0005%, which is three orders of\nmagnitude lower than that of the normal device \u00010.52%\u0002.\nThere is also a significant \u201ckink,\u201d near to zero field con-\ndition \u0001Voc\u0002, in the J-V characteristics of the reverse devices\n\u0001Fig. 1\u0002. The physics behind the formation of such kinks is\nnot thoroughly understood but is thought to relate to the\neffects of limitation in charge transfer between the active\nlayer and the electrodes and due to interfacial recombination\nresulting in cycling of charges at the organic-electrode\ninterfaces.21 Interestingly, in the J-V characteristics of the\nreverse device with the Ag particles \u0001Fig. 3\u0002, the kink is\nsignificantly reduced relative to the reference device. The\nremoval of this kink can be attributed to the increase in the\ncurrent as a result of improved charge extraction at the elec-\ntrodes, which prevents accumulation of charges at the\norganic-electrode interface.\nTo conclude, in this letter we report the operation of\nreverse structure bilayer OPV. It is postulated that the mecha-\nnism of photocurrent generation in reverse cell structures is\nsignificantly different to that observed in normal heterojunc-\ntion devices. The results presented indicate that charge car-\nriers generated at the electrode-organic interfaces rather than\nat the organic heterojunction are the main contributor to the\nmeasured photocurrent. To test this hypothesis, we incorpo-\nrated silver nanoclusters at the organic heterojunction to\nquench excitons and facilitate recombination of free charge\ncarriers, resulting in a predicted increase of Jsc. The larger\nVoc in these reversed cell structures can also be rationalized\nin the context of this model.\nThe authors wish to thank the EPSRC for a Portfolio\nPartnership award which has facilitated the research con-\nducted in this project and the studentship awarded.\n1S.
