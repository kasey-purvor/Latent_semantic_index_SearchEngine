It is also being \napplied widely, if often informally, in UK education. To date, however, the academic \ncommunity has shown little interest.  \n \nCraft (2001),1 in an earlier issue of this journal, attempts to locate NLP in relation to \nother theories and academic work. This is a welcome endeavour. However, in the \nlight of our own knowledge and experience of NLP, we feel it is both urgent and \nimportant to make a critical response. We wish to offer our perspective on the nature \nof NLP, and to address the questions raised in Craft's article. In doing so we will take \nissue with several of its assertions.  \n \nAs an overall observation, we are uneasy about Craft's reliance on so few, mainly \nsecondary, sources for the article's understanding of NLP. Chief among these is \nO'Connor and McDermott (1996). This source is a useful introduction to NLP for \ngeneral purposes, but insufficient for a scholarly review of the field. Of the fifteen \ncitations in the reference list just one is an original work on NLP, and only passing \nreference to this is made in the article. Nor does the article consult any works that are \nregarded as significant influences on NLP (as cited in the text of this article). Equally \nwe feel bound to remark on the tendency for Craft's article to make assertions and \ngeneralisations about the nature of NLP without clarification of the author's sources \nor authorities (for example, the account of \u2018modelling\u2019 : 131-2). Overall, we contend \nthat closer scrutiny of original and wider sources on NLP is likely to yield a different \nperspective on many of the issues raised. \nThe Curriculum Journal Vol. 14 No. 3 Autumn 2003 pp 371 \u2013 388 \n   4\n \nCraft (125) poses five main concerns:  \n \n1 NLP's theoretical coherence (internally and in relation to existing theories); its \nstatus as a set of strategies rather than as a theory or model; and \u2018internal \ninconsistencies' which are an obstacle to it being regarded \u2018among the dominant \nlearning theories of our age'. \n2 The nature of modelling in NLP, especially \u2018how far copying an expert's behaviour \ncan really lead to a learner becoming an expert', and the degree of attention to \ndomain of application. \n3 Whether there is dissonance between NLP catering \u2018to individuality in learning \nwhile also proposing a view that learning is best done experientially'.  \n4 Whether learners are \u2018really as predictable and as subject to cause\/effect' as \nDilts\u2019s \u2018theory' of logical levels would suggest. \n5 The epistemological basis of NLP.  \n \nWe address these questions after first describing the origins and background of NLP. \nThe article ends with a summary of some criticisms of NLP, and of its potential \napplications in education.  \n \nAs background on our own position and perspective, our discipline bases are \neducation and management. We have trained in NLP, the first author to \u2018Master \nPractitioner\u2019 level in the UK (in 1992), the second beyond Master Practitioner level to \nacquire Trainer status (accredited by Richard Bandler). We have found NLP of \nimmense value not only in our professional practice in higher education, but also as a \ntopic for research, and as a prospective tool for qualitative research.  \n  \nOur aim here is to provide a well-informed perspective on NLP. We intend to be \nThe Curriculum Journal Vol. 14 No. 3 Autumn 2003 pp 371 \u2013 388 \n   5\nbalanced, open about the value we find in NLP as well as acknowledging criticisms \nand limitations. We believe that NLP holds great potential for education at all levels; \nwe also acknowledge the need for research into, and critical evaluation of, NLP. Our \nbroad intent is to help bridge the worlds of NLP and formal education. Thus while we \ndo not claim to be neutral on the subject, neither do we consider ourselves over-\nidentified with the world of NLP. We do not, for example, hold any public office or \nother position of power or responsibility within the NLP community. \n \n \nNEURO-LINGUISTIC PROGRAMMING: BACKGROUND \n \nNeuro-linguistic Programming (NLP) was developed at the University of California at \nSanta Cruz in the 1970s (Jacobson, 1994; McLendon, 1989). Its founders and principal \nauthors were Richard Bandler, a mathematician and information scientist, and John \nGrinder, a linguist. Their partners, Leslie Cameron-Bandler and Judith DeLozier, also \ncontributed significantly, as did other early developers such as Robert Dilts and David \nGordon.  \n \nThe term \u2018Neuro-linguistic Programming, coined by Bandler and Grinder, refers to \npurported systematic links between a person\u2019s internal experience (neuro), their \nlanguage (linguistic) and their patterns of behaviour (programming). Despite the name \nand its connotations it has no direct connection to neuro-science, or to computer \nprogramming, although these were fields of interest to its developers2. NLP has been \ndefined in various ways, often in its promotional literature as (for example) \u2018the art of \ncommunication excellence\u2019 or \u2018the study of the structure of subjective experience\u2019 \n(McWhirter, 1992).  \n \n \nThe Curriculum Journal Vol. 14 No. 3 Autumn 2003 pp 371 \u2013 388 \n   6\nThe first NLP publication was Bandler and Grinder\u2019s Structure of Magic: A Book about \nLanguage and Therapy (1975a; see also Grinder and Bandler, 1976), an attempt to \nidentify patterns of communication that distinguished effective (\u2018excellent\u2019) \ncommunicators from others. It was based on studies of, among others, Virginia Satir, a \nleading family therapist, and Fritz Perls, the founder of Gestalt therapy, whose skills \nBandler and Grinder modelled. The outcome of this, NLP's \u2018meta-model', is distinctive in \nthat it identifies language patterns that are believed to reflect basic cognitive processes. \nThe meta-model is generally considered the core model of NLP.  It is therefore \nsurprising that Craft's article makes no mention of it. \n \nBandler and Grinder have long since gone their separate ways.  Both remain active in \nthe field, though Bandler trademarks his recent developments as \u2018Design Human \nEngineering\u2019 (DHE). Since the 1980s Grinder has concentrated on \u2018new code\u2019 NLP \n(DeLozier and Grinder, 1987), 3 which takes an intentionally more holistic (i.e. whole \nbody-mind) approach than the more analytical style of early NLP.  \n \nNLP has burgeoned into one of the world\u2019s most popular forms of interpersonal skill and \ncommunication training. The UK Association for NLP, for example, lists over 50 training \norganizations, and estimates that around 150,000 people (in the UK, we assume) had \nhad some training in NLP by the end of the year 2000. 4 NLP is used, whether explicitly \nor otherwise, by professional practitioners of many kinds \u2013 educators, managers, \ntrainers, sales people, market researchers, counsellors, consultants, medics, lawyers \nand more. There are a number of competing NLP accrediting bodies or professional \nassociations worldwide. In the UK, NLP is a recognized psychotherapy (assigned to the \nExperiential Constructivist Therapies section) accredited by the UK Council for \nPsychotherapy. 5 In education, there is an enthusiastic UK NLP network called \n\u2018NLPEdNet'. 6 There is interest too from associations such as the Society for Effective \nAffective Learning (SEAL). 7  \nThe Curriculum Journal Vol. 14 No. 3 Autumn 2003 pp 371 \u2013 388 \n   7\nThere is a limited, sporadic literature in several fields. These include education (Craft, \n2001), training and development (e.g. Lee, 1993; Thompson et al., 2002; Trickey, \n1997), accelerated learning (e.g. Sandhu, 1994; Stanton, 1994) , counselling and \npsychotherapy (e.g. Geronilla, 1989), clinical psychology and hypnotherapy (e.g. \nBarnett, 1990; Field, 1990; Jupp, 1989), and management (e.g. Ashok and \nSanthakumar, 2002; Georges, 1996). Much of this literature explores applications of \nNLP to the field of practice in question.  \n \nOtherwise, publication in NLP has primarily been by and for those in the NLP \ncommunity. There are numerous books by key developers (authors such as Bandler, \nGrinder, Dilts and others), and copious volumes communicating NLP more widely, of \nwhich O'Connor and McDermott (1996) is one example. The most comprehensive \nreference source is Dilts\u2019s Encyclopedia of Systemic NLP (2000). There has been one \nattempt at a journal in an academic style, NLP World, 8 which was published from 1994 \n\u2013 2001. There are plans to relaunch it as a practitioner-oriented magazine, conceived of \nexplicitly as \u2018the voice of NLP in the NLP community\u2019. 9 \n \nAcademe appears relatively untouched by NLP. There has been a modicum of research \ninterest from experimental psychology, consisting mainly of studies that examined \nNLP\u2019s \u2018eye movement\u2019 model (e.g. Baddeley and Predebon, 1991; Buckner et al., 1987; \nDorn et al., 1983; Farmer et al., 1985; Poffel and Cross, 1985; Wertheim et al., 1986). \nThese studies, many of which are summarized by Bolstad (1997), found no basis for \nacceptance of the model. It seems unlikely that a handful of unfavourable \nexperimental studies accounts for this lack of academic interest. Possible reasons \nmay include a \u2018chicken and egg\u2019 effect: NLP is not obviously the remit of any \nestablished discipline, so does not become mainstream. Another possibility is that \nNLP is not considered worthy of \u2018serious\u2019 study, whether because of its Californian \norigins, or a certain reputation as a \u2018manipulative\u2019 approach (though controversy might \nThe Curriculum Journal Vol. 14 No. 3 Autumn 2003 pp 371 \u2013 388 \n   8\nbe expected to make it more, rather than less, attractive to research attention). Equally, \nthere seems little incentive for NLP to build bridges with the academic world if this \nresults in exposure to hostile theoretical interests or misunderstanding. To date, NLP \nseems most welcomed by informal practitioner networks (including teaching, as \nrepresented in NLPEdNet) that encourage direct use of NLP's strategies.   \n \nWe do believe there is a need for research into NLP, for example in order to evaluate \nNLP through representing the views and experiences of those who have used it. With \nthe relatively introspective nature of the NLP community, NLP \u2018users' sometimes \nseem to have little voice except when required as testimonials for trainers\u2019 publicity. \n \n \nTHE COHERENCE OF NEURO-LINGUISTIC PROGRAMMING THEORY \n \nThe first of Craft's questions is about the theoretical coherence of NLP, both internally \nand in relation to existing theories; and to what extent NLP is a theory, rather than a \ncollection of models and\/or strategies.  \n \nThere is no doubt that NLP is eclectic, in that it draws from a wide range of sources. \nThus within NLP one can detect influences from Gestalt therapy (Perls, 1969), person-\ncentred counselling (Rogers, 1961), transformational grammar (Grinder and Elgin, \n1973), behavioural psychology and cybernetics (Ashby, 1965), the Palo Alto school of \nbrief therapy (Watzlawick et al., 1967), Ericksonian hypnotherapy (Bandler and Grinder, \n1975b; Grinder et al., 1977), and, most importantly, the cybernetic epistemology of \nGregory Bateson (Bateson, 1972). \n \nWhat might this eclecticism signify? It probably needs to be viewed in the context of \nearly statements from the originators of NLP dismissing interest in articulating or \nThe Curriculum Journal Vol. 14 No. 3 Autumn 2003 pp 371 \u2013 388 \n   9\nacquiring theory. For example, \u2018We have no idea about the \u201creal\u201d nature of things, \nand we\u2019re not particularly interested in what\u2019s \u201ctrue\u201d. The function of modeling is to \narrive at descriptions which are useful.\u2019 (Bandler and Grinder, 1979: 7).  \n \nThe claims to be disinterested in theory can also, we believe, be regarded as \ndeliberately disingenuous and provocative. Bandler and Grinder's intent, perhaps, was \nto stay close to experience and avoid abstract discussion about the truths of human \nexperience. As Craft points out, any practical method or principle for action, whether in \nteaching or elsewhere, necessarily has \u2018theory\u2019 behind it; the issue is simply whether \nthat theory has been articulated. NLP places more emphasis on developing practical \nobservational and listening skills, acquired through practice and apprenticeship, than on \ngenerating theory.  \n \nBandler and Grinder were also extremely critical of the range of psychotherapies \navailable in the USA which, as they perceived it, were rarely effective (i.e. in the sense \nof leading to change for individual clients), despite having a mass of intellectual \nframeworks. They strongly challenged the assumption that personal change necessarily \ninvolves long-term therapy, and is only possible with insight into one\u2019s past experience. \nIn this respect Bandler and Grinder could be seen as offering a critique of North \nAmerican \u2018shrink culture\u2019, and championing consumer-focused rather than profession-\nled human services.  \n \nThe state of NLP theory can also be seen as a consequence of the original claim to be \na methodology or modelling process. Its theory is about the nature of models and \nmodelling (Cameron-Bandler et al., 1985; Dilts, 1998a). In that sense it is theory \nsubstantially concerned with epistemology, 10 where epistemology refers to the science \nof \u2018knowing\u2019 (Bateson and Bateson, 1988: 20; see also Bateson, 1991: 215\u201324). We \nreturn to the issue of modelling later, as this is related to one of Craft's questions. \nThe Curriculum Journal Vol. 14 No. 3 Autumn 2003 pp 371 \u2013 388 \n   10\n \nThus NLP was led by a pragmatic, applied interest, not by a concern to develop \ntheory. Bandler and Grinder were interested in figures such as Carl Rogers, Fritz \nPerls and Virginia Satir because of their reputation for excellence. There were other \npractitioners apparently informed by the same framework but with marked variation in \neffectiveness. Bandler and Grinder's question was, what was the \u2018difference that \nmade a difference' between the excellent practitioners and the others? Almost self-\nevidently, this was not the formalised theory being used. Instead, they focused on \npatterns of communication and interaction - more the means and process through \nwhich the formal theory was mobilised and applied.   \n \nThe theory of NLP was therefore regarded as an emergent by-product \u2013 moreover, in \nBandler and Grinder's eyes, an inessential by-product \u2013 of application. However, \ndoes a theory need to be internally consistent in order to be valid? This seems a \nmodernist more than a post-modern view. We suggest that NLP may be regarded as a \ntransdisciplinary (Gibbons et al., 1994), in the sense that it innovates by drawing on \nsources from academe and from elsewhere. NLP in practice has been generated \nthrough application more than being deduced from axioms. \n \n \nNLP: UNDERLYING THEORETICAL ASSUMPTIONS? \n \nWhat (if anything) is the theoretical identity of NLP? Craft asks to which type or family of \nlearning theory NLP seems to belong (though we note that this begs the question of \nwhether NLP should be regarded as a learning theory at all). We agree in part with \nCraft's view that NLP \u2018draws on the fundamental assumptions of the theoretical \nframework of social constructivism\u2019 (131). This is consistent with NLP\u2019s assignment to \nthe Experiential Constructivist Therapies section of the UKCP.  \nThe Curriculum Journal Vol. 14 No. 3 Autumn 2003 pp 371 \u2013 388 \n   11\n \nHowever NLP, in our view, draws on aspects of all three groups of learning theory \nidentified by Craft  (128). Within NLP one can identify reflections of \u2018learning as growth' \n(e.g. in the broad belief in human potential, together with the influences from authors \nsuch as Perls and Satir); learning as \u2018association' (e.g. in the techniques of \u2018anchoring' - \nsee Bandler and Grinder, 1979); and learning as development and construction (e.g. \nreflected in the principle that we each construct our own maps of the world). As Craft \nsays (and we concur), \u2018All teaching and learning are likely to involve elements of each \ntheoretical perspective' (128 - 129).  \n \nNLP may be constructivist in its emphasis on the way people create, act according to , \nand can change and reconstruct, their own \u2018maps of the world'. Perhaps more important \nis that it is firmly systemic, or cybernetic, in its very strong interest in how such maps are \nconstructed, utilized and change. This is central, in our view, to NLP's potential \nrelevance to learning theory and processes of education.  \n \nThere is no doubt in our minds, therefore, that NLP is properly described as primarily \nreflecting a systemic theory. For example, NLP explicitly regards a person as a whole \nmind-body system with patterned connections between internal experience (\u2018neuro\u2019), \nlanguage (\u2018linguistic') and behaviour (\u2018programming\u2019). As a paradigm of system \nbehaviour, NLP adopts the TOTE (test-operate-test-exit) mode of functioning (Miller, \nGalanter and Pribram, 1960), which is significant in relation to learning. These \nprocesses depend on the dynamics of calibration and feedback (Wiener, 1965; \nBateson, 1972). NLP is also predicated on the philosophical principle that systems \ndemonstrate different logical levels (Russell, 1921), and the cybernetic principle that \nsystems are based on information and characterized by feedback loops.  \n \nCraft does not mention this systemic core to NLP, although her article does refer \nThe Curriculum Journal Vol. 14 No. 3 Autumn 2003 pp 371 \u2013 388 \n   12\nindirectly to cybernetic principles through the quotation from Alder (1994; see Craft, \n2001: 127). It also assigns what we regard as a fundamental cybernetic characteristic \n(\u2018the notion of working through errors or \u201cfailures\u201d as information', Craft, 131) to a \nconstructivist orientation. Of course this may be a matter of debate. (Does one regard \ncybernetics as a subset of constructivism?).  \n \nArguably the underlying theory of NLP is best represented in the work of Gregory \nBateson. Bateson was not an NLP theorist himself but was consulted by the founders.  \nHaving enjoyed a long and eclectic academic career, and having made significant \ncontributions to fields as diverse as anthropology, cybernetics and psychiatry (Bateson, \n1972, 1979, 1991; Bateson and Bateson, 1988), Bateson was living in California. For a \nwhile he and Bandler were neighbours (close enough, apparently, for Bandler to hear \nBateson typing). 11  \n \nBateson's views, perhaps explained most accessibly in Mind and Nature (Bateson, \n1979) are strongly represented in NLP\u2019s core guiding principles, known as \npresuppositions (e.g. Dilts, 1998b). In NLP these constitute a worldview that is \nusually expressed aphoristically, and drawn from different sources. A typical list of \noperational presuppositions found in NLP training manuals, for example, is as \nfollows:  \n \n\u2022 The map is not the territory (Korzybski, 1958). \n\u2022 Mind and body are part of the same cybernetic structure.  \n\u2022 All behaviour is positively intended. \n\u2022 People are making the best choice available to them in any situation. \n\u2022 Every limitation presented to you is a unique accomplishment by a human being. \n\u2022 There is no failure, only feedback. \nThe Curriculum Journal Vol. 14 No. 3 Autumn 2003 pp 371 \u2013 388 \n   13\n\u2022 The meaning of your communication is the response you get. \n\u2022 Consciousness is a limited phenomenon. \n \nAccording to this worldview, NLP assumes that people are inherently creative and \ncapable, and also ultimately well intentioned. Communication happens through verbal \nand non-verbal channels, both consciously and unconsciously. People act according to \nthe way they understand and represent the world, not according to the way the world \u2018is' \n(i.e. \u2018the map is not the territory'). Skills, beliefs and behaviours are all learnt, and \nconsist of sequences of representations, therefore change and learning can be \nachieved through modifying such representations and sequences. NLP also assumes \nthat functioning of which human beings are conscious, and which can be controlled \nconsciously, represents only a small proportion of total functioning.  \n \nThus while NLP literature generally does not articulate an underlying theory, it is \npossible to infer a theoretical coherence to NLP largely and essentially based on the \naxioms of Bateson\u2019s (systemic) perspective. We could, therefore, concur broadly with \nCraft's assertion that NLP is a set of strategies rather than a theory. However, \naccording to the way Craft defines theory, NLP's presuppositions do supply \n\u2018fundamental assumptions which then underpin the workings of models of \nunderstanding' (130). To add to the confusion, in Craft's terms, it seems to us that \nNLP is a set of models, not just a collection of strategies. Craft herself cites Dilts's \n\u2018logical levels\u2019; we referred above to the most fundamental NLP model, the \u2018meta-\nmodel' of language.  \n \n \nTHE EPISTEMOLOGY OF NLP \n \nJust before her concluding remarks, Craft interjects a surprising and unexamined \nThe Curriculum Journal Vol. 14 No. 3 Autumn 2003 pp 371 \u2013 388 \n   14\nstatement. She suggests that \u2018the epistemological position of Neuro-linguistic \nProgramming appears to be that reality \u201cexists\u201d out there\u2019 (133). Putting aside the \nquestion of whether this is a matter of epistemology or of ontology, we take issue most \nstrongly with this.  \n \nNLP adopts Korzybski's dictum that \u2018the map is not the territory' as a common slogan. If \ntreated very literally, the dictum implies that a \u2018territory' exists. However, we know of \nnothing in NLP that reinforces the idea of the existence of an independent outer reality. \nOn the contrary, the entire epistemological thrust of NLP, following Bateson (e.g. 1972), \nis that it is the processes of perception and conceptualization (through language) that \ncreate individuals' experiences.  \n \nTwo aspects of NLP are particularly relevant to this emphasis on how each person \nconstructs their reality. These also expand on the way NLP \u2018relates words, thoughts \nand behaviours to purposes and goals' (126). \n \nFirst, NLP considers that verbal reports may be literal accounts of people\u2019s inner \nexperience. Thus when a person describes what they can \u2018see in their mind\u2019s eye\u2019, \nNLP assumes that the person is experiencing internal visual imagery (which may be \noutside their awareness). Furthermore, the qualities and characteristics of that \nimagery are significant, and relate in systematic ways to other aspects of that \nperson\u2019s experience (e.g. feelings, beliefs, behaviour and so on). One of the most \nimportant beliefs from which NLP operates is that we use all our senses to code \nexperience internally. The technical term for this is \u2018internal representation\u2019 (the word \n\u2018imagery\u2019 does not immediately conjure up the role of hearing, feeling, tasting, \nsmelling and movement in the coding of experience). \n \nHow people use their senses internally, and the kinds of internal representations they \nThe Curriculum Journal Vol. 14 No. 3 Autumn 2003 pp 371 \u2013 388 \n   15\ncreate, are believed to be unique to every individual. NLP does not claim that there \nare universal regularities in the specific content or structure of such imagery (except \nthat the senses are always used as an interior coding device) and so emphasizes the \nneed to gather information about each individual\u2019s \u2018map of the world\u2019. This has clear \nimplications for the practice of teaching and learning and is in tune with a \nconstructionist perspective. \n \nInternal imagery12 appears in personal development (e.g. Glouberman, 1989), \npsychotherapy, sports psychology and elsewhere. What NLP adds is a systematic \nmodel of distinctions within that imagery, called \u2018submodalities\u2019 (Bandler, 1985; \nBandler and MacDonald, 1988), which are thought to be related to physiological \neffects in the body; and an approach to how such images are connected in \nsequences of thought processes and related behaviour (know as \u2018strategies\u2019, Bandler \nand Grinder, 1979: 28).  \n \nThe second key feature, building on Grinder\u2019s knowledge of transformational \ngrammar (e.g. Grinder and Elgin, 1973; Bandler and Grinder, 1975a: Appendix A, \n183 \u2013 210), is that NLP is predicated on the notion that individuals\u2019 patterns of \nlanguage reveal some of their fundamental epistemological processes, their unique \nways of mapping the territory of their experience and guiding action. NLP language \nmodels (the original meta-model and subsequent additions, e.g. Hall, 1989) identify \nnatural language patterns that correspond to these epistemological processes. \n \nBandler and Grinder\u2019s approach to language has not yet, if the lack of citations in \npublications in linguistics and cognitive psychology is an accurate indicator, been \nscrutinized by academe. It does, however, appear to be supported in some respects \nby work in related fields (e.g. Talmy, 1985; Johnson, 1987; Fauconnier, 1997; \nFauconnier and Turner, 2002). Chafe (1994), working in the field of Discourse \nThe Curriculum Journal Vol. 14 No. 3 Autumn 2003 pp 371 \u2013 388 \n   16\nAnalysis, comes to a similar conclusion twenty years after the publication of the first \nbook of Bandler and Grinder\u2019s. \n \nThis approach appears similar to the learning theory of Vygotsky (1939) who not only \nproposed a relationship between language and thought, but also that \u2018every thought \ntends to connect something with something else, to establish a relationship between \ntwo things\u2019 (Vygotsky,1939: 33). To our knowledge, Vygotsky is not referenced by \nBandler and Grinder, so the relationship between NLP and Vygotsky's learning \ntheory could be a relevant and fruitful line to explore. \n  \n \nMODELLING AS REPLICATION \n \nCraft (131) questions the degree to which \u2018modelling' can enable replication of abilities. \nCraft relies initially (126) on O'Connor and McDermott's (1996) description of modelling. \nLater, however, modelling is described as \u2018pretending to be someone else', \u2018copying \nwhat one is aware of \u2013 often \"surface\" features of another person's behaviour' (131). \nThis later material, in our view, misrepresents the nature of modelling. \n \nAs noted above, NLP claimed originally to be a methodology or modelling process. \nJacobson (1994) explains: \n \nThe actual\u2026 methodology, that Bandler and Grinder used is known as human \nmodeling\u2026the addition of specific NLP technology makes it possible to discover much \nof what this human model does that he or she is not aware of. To do this well means to \nactually study the structure of people\u2019s thought processes and internal experience, as \nwell as their observable behaviour. \n \nThe Curriculum Journal Vol. 14 No. 3 Autumn 2003 pp 371 \u2013 388 \n   17\nNLP insists that people re-create their experiences internally through all their senses, \nso that any approach to modelling must include investigation into both language \npatterns and the internal representations that sub-tend them (Bandler and \nMacDonald, 1988). The essence of modelling in NLP is to use its various frameworks \n(models)13 to construct a multi-perspective \u2018map' of a particular skill or quality. This is \nhighly unlikely to result in identifying surface features only. Indeed, we suspect that \nwith her emphasis on \u2018copying', Craft may be conflating \u2018modelling' in NLP with the \nmore basic technique of \u2018mirroring'. (\u2018In NLP, \"mirroring\" is the process of reflecting or \nfeeding back physical patterns of behavior of another person': Dilts, 2000: 782.) \n \nNLP, then, emphasizes the importance of identifying elements of the map that are \nessential to the skill. One well-known example in NLP, relevant to school education, \nis that of the \u2018spelling strategy' (Bandler and Grinder, 1979: 33). It is held in NLP that \nthose who can spell effectively share a common internal strategy. Whether or not one \naccepts this claim, the strategy itself is an example of a very simple, streamlined  \n\u2018model' that can be learnt by anyone. \n \nOur experience is that modelling can provide a remarkably effective and streamlined \nway to learn some capabilities. However, it is quite possible for this approach to be \nover-simplified, especially on initial acquaintance, and to assume that all skills can be \nmodelled in a straightforward manner.  \n \nWe would have difficulty in commenting further, as Craft's argument at this point \nappears under-explained and possibly confused. She claims, for example, that NLP \nmodelling involves copying \u2018someone else who is an expert performer'; then she says \n\u2018NLP, however, is much less concerned with the expert practitioner' (132). We do not \nunderstand what is meant by \u2018copying, without negotiation'. While there is little \nliterature specifically about NLP modelling, Craft does not appear to have consulted \nThe Curriculum Journal Vol. 14 No. 3 Autumn 2003 pp 371 \u2013 388 \n   18\nthe literature that does exist (in particular, Dilts, 1998a). While we agree in principle \nwith Craft's point about the significance of context, 14 we do not know on what basis \nshe asserts that NLP \u2018gives no role to the domain of application' (132). No source, \nauthority or evidence is cited to support this assertion.  \n \nA similar comment applies to Craft's argument regarding the experiential nature of NLP. \nFirst, the article states that NLP proposes \u2018a view that learning is best done \nexperientially' (125), and \u2018is said to be \"experiential\"' (132). No source or authority is \ncited, nor does the article define what is meant by \u2018experiential' in this context. This is \nimportant because the term \u2018experiential learning' is problematic and varied in usage \n(Boud et al., 1993; Jarvis et al., 1998). While we would not dispute that in very broad \nterms NLP involves learning from experience, we are simply not sure what is being \nasserted or claimed here.  \n \nFinally in this section, the article implies that experiential learning is somehow in conflict \nwith notions of learning styles. This seems an extraordinary suggestion, especially \nwhen one considers that Honey and Mumford's work is based on Kolb's (1984) \n\u2018experiential learning cycle' (Honey and Mumford, 1982: 3), which incorporates all four \nbasic learning styles. That Craft's article assigns experiential learning to just one of \nHoney and Mumford's styles seems a confusion of logical types and further emphasizes \nthe need to be more precise with the term \u2018experiential learning'. Craft then asserts that \nNLP is an approach which \u2018reflects the learning of \"pragmatists\" in particular' (132). \nThere is no discussion of the grounds for, or validity of, this assertion. 15 Whether or not \nthe assertion has any merit is therefore impossible to assess.  \n \nThe article's argument that there is dissonance between the claim that NLP caters to \nindividuality in learning while also proposing a view that learning is best done \nexperientially  (in the abstract (125) and again in the conclusion (133)) appears to \nThe Curriculum Journal Vol. 14 No. 3 Autumn 2003 pp 371 \u2013 388 \n   19\nrely entirely on the passage we have just discussed. Regrettably, we cannot see how \nthe argument as presented has enough substance to enable any meaningful \nresponse. \n  \n \nLOGICAL LEVELS AS A THEORY \n \nHaving argued that NLP is a set of strategies, we note that Craft refers to Dilts\u2019s \u2018logical \nlevels' as a \u2018theory' (in the abstract (125)). Later, Craft refers to it as a \u2018model' (131). \nHowever it is labelled, the first question that arises is whether Dilts's \u2018logical levels' does \nhypothesize \u2018predictability and being subject to cause\/effect' in the way that Craft \nsuggests. It seems clear, based both on literature and on our first-hand experience of \nDilts's teachings, that the \u2018logical levels' model is intended primarily as an abstraction \nand as a heuristic device. 16  \n \nAgain, Craft relies on a secondary source (O'Connor and McDermott, 1996). Dilts \nhas surely published sufficient on this framework (Dilts and Epstein, 1995; Dilts, \n1996; Dilts, 2000) to warrant original sources being consulted and cited. In this \nparticular instance, too, we would recommend reference to Bateson's seminal paper, \n\u2018The logical categories of learning and communication' (in Bateson, 1972).  \n \nAccording to Dilts's encyclopaedia: \n \nThe concept of logical levels of learning and change was initially formulated as a \nmechanism in the behavioral sciences by Gregory Bateson, based on the work of \nBertrand Russell in logic and mathematics. The term logical levels, as it is used in \nNLP, was adapted from Bateson's work by Robert Dilts in the mid-1980s, and refers \nto a hierarchy of levels or processes within an individual or group. The function of \nThe Curriculum Journal Vol. 14 No. 3 Autumn 2003 pp 371 \u2013 388 \n   20\neach level is to synthesize, organize and direct the interactions on the level below it. \nChanging something on an upper level would necessarily \u2018radiate' downward, \nprecipitating change on the lower level. Changing something on a lower level could, \nbut would not necessarily, affect the upper levels. (Dilts, 2000: 688)   \n \nThis text does seem to imply a causal direction of change from upper to lower level. \nHowever, saying that change on one level will follow from change on another does \nnot mean that this works deterministically. As an example, the principle is that a \nperson's beliefs about learning (e.g. about how learning happens; about what it is \nand is not possible to learn; about how good a learner they perceive themselves to \nbe; and so on) will influence both their ability to learn and their behaviour. A change \nin belief is likely to affect capabilities and behaviour. It is also possible, if less \ncommon, that a change in behaviour may trigger a change in belief. Using Craft's \nexample (126), noticing that she had begun to catch a ball could have prompted the \nrecognition, \u2018so I can catch a ball!' (belief about capability), and perhaps \u2018so maybe \nthat means I am not stupid, after all' (identity).  \n \nThus we understand Bateson and Dilts to be saying that a change at a higher logical \nlevel will necessarily have some effect at lower logical levels. But Dilts is not, so far \nas we are aware from the literature and from personal experience of his teaching, \nremotely suggesting that manipulations at belief level by a teacher will determine the \nresponses the teacher would like to see at lower levels. The notion of logical levels is \nan aid to thinking about such issues, not a mechanistic technique. \n \n \nNLP, LEARNING THEORY AND CURRICULUM: BRIEF IMPLICATIONS \n \nWe are delighted that Craft's article has attempted to bring NLP to the attention of a \nThe Curriculum Journal Vol. 14 No. 3 Autumn 2003 pp 371 \u2013 388 \n   21\nwider academic and practitioner audience. Debating NLP's relationship to learning \ntheory seems a valuable and valid exercise. We have indicated several relevant \ntheories so far, though we do not have the space to explore these relationships in \ndetail.  \n \nAs an example of a theoretical issue, NLP in our experience concentrates on the \nintrapersonal, intrapsychic processes of reality construction. It attends little, if at all, to \nthe social context and intersubjectivity. If it is a learning theory, it is one that emphasizes \nindividual rather than social learning. Craft identifies another possible line of enquiry \nwhen she asks how NLP relates \u2018to the dominant learning theories used to \nunderstand and facilitate the learning of children' (our emphasis). This is because \nNLP, to our knowledge, has no explicit developmental theory. \n \nNevertheless, NLP has much potential relevance for, and application to, the practices \nof teaching and learning. Again, this would need more space to explore further. As an \nindication, there are implications at various levels. One concerns the philosophy or \ntheory underlying teaching, and the potentially profound implications of applying the \nunderlying cybernetic epistemology to the practice of education. At the other \nextreme, where there is most evidence of uptake to date (see the NLPEdNet website, \nfor example), is the level of technique. Here NLP may offer \u2018solutions' to many \n\u2018problems' encountered in teaching, for example to do with classroom management.  \n \nBoth levels have implications for the training and development of teachers, and for \ncurricula. We support Craft's view (130) that \u2018the role of theoretical underpinning is \n[being] degraded further and further in initial teacher education and in-service \ntraining'. The second author is currently conducting a doctoral study of the links \nbetween language and internal imagery, with reference to implications for teachers\u2019 \nuse of language in educational settings. She is exploring at two levels: first, the \nThe Curriculum Journal Vol. 14 No. 3 Autumn 2003 pp 371 \u2013 388 \n   22\ndifferences in internal imagery that correspond to people\u2019s responses to micro-\nvariations in the wording of a question or statement; and second, a teacher\u2019s \ninfluence on students\u2019 beliefs about learning. This is, to our knowledge, the first \nformal study testing NLP\u2019s models of, and assumptions about, language patterns. \nShe concludes that there are specific learning processes that are language \nmediated. The implications of this study for understanding ways in which teachers \ninfluence students\u2019 learning appear highly significant for the training of educators.  \n \n \nSUMMARY \n \nIn this article we have described the origin of NLP and discussed its theoretical base. \nWhile we appreciate Craft opening up debate about NLP, we have had cause to \ncontest much of her article. The first of Craft's five main points seems the most fruitful \nto debate, especially in order to position NLP in relation to existing theories. Here our \nposition is that NLP is certainly eclectic. To what extent it is coherent, and whether it \nshould be regarded as a theory, a set of models or a collection of strategies, is open \nto debate. We have suggested that NLP could be regarded as a form of \ntransdisciplinary knowledge. According to Craft's typology, NLP appears to draw on \nall three groupings of learning theory. \n \nIt is questionable whether it is appropriate to seek a high degree of internal \ntheoretical coherence to NLP. We are not sure how important this question is \u2013 to \nwhom does it matter, and for what purpose? No writers in the field appear to aspire to \nNLP being regarded \u2018among the dominant learning theories of our age' (125). Indeed, \nthere seems to be no evidence that writers on NLP aspire to make it a formal theory \nat all. Nevertheless, we regard NLP as fundamentally, and reasonably consistently, \nbased on principles of a cybernetic epistemology, especially as articulated by \nThe Curriculum Journal Vol. 14 No. 3 Autumn 2003 pp 371 \u2013 388 \n   23\nBateson (1972, 1979).  \n \nWe believe we have offered an explicit critique of Craft's other initial questions. Here \nwe conclude by emphasizing our hope of enhancing understanding of NLP and its \npotential for education through scholarly enquiry. \n \nNOTES \n                                                \n1 Many subsequent references are from this same article.
