However, its pharmacokinetic properties are poor and this fact is believed to be a major reason for EO9's lack of clinical efficacy. The purpose of this study was to develop quinone-based bioreductive drugs that retained EO9's good properties, in terms of bioreductive activation, but have improved pharmacokinetic properties. Out of 11 naphthoquinone compounds evaluated, 2-aziridinyl-5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (compound 2), 2,3-bis(aziridinyl)-5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (compound 3), and 2-aziridinyl-6-hydroxymethyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (compound 11) were selected for further evaluation based on good substrate specificity for NQO1 and selectivity towards NQO1-rich cells in vitro. Compound 3 was of particular interest as it also demonstrated selectivity for NQO1-rich cells under hypoxic conditions. Compound 3 was not metabolised by murine whole blood in vitro (in contrast to compounds 2, 11 and EO9) and pharmacokinetic studies in non-tumour-bearing mice in vivo (at the maximum soluble dose of 60 mg kg\u00bf1 administered intraperitoneally) demonstrated significant improvements in plasma half-life (16.2 min) and AUC values (22.5 \u00bfM h) compared to EO9 (T1\/2 = 1.8 min, AUC = 0.184 \u00bfM h). Compound 3 also demonstrated significant anti-tumour activity against H460 and HCT-116 human tumour xenografts in vivo, whereas EO9 was inactive against these tumours. In conclusion, compound 3 is a promising lead compound that may target both aerobic and hypoxic fractions of NQO1-rich tumours and further studies to elucidate its mechanism of action and improve solubility are warranted","downloadUrl":"","fullTextIdentifier":null,"pdfHashValue":null,"publisher":null,"rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n        \n            \n                oai:bradscholars.brad.ac.uk:10454\/3804<\/identifier><datestamp>\n                2016-10-25T16:17:06Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n                com_10454_152<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_10454_6342<\/setSpec>\n            <\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:doc=\"http:\/\/www.lyncode.com\/xoai\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n            \nPharmacological and biological evaluation of a series of substituted 1,4 naphthoquinone bioreductive drugs.<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\nPhillips, Roger M.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nLoadman, Paul M.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nMaitland, Derek J.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nShnyder, S.D.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nJaffar, M.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nSteans, J.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nCooper, Patricia A.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nRace, A.
