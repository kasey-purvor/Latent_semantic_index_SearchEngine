The 29 \ntechnique of moss analysis provides a surrogate, time-integrated measure of metal deposition 30 \nfrom the atmosphere to terrestrial systems. It is easier and cheaper, less prone to 31 \ncontamination and allows a much higher sampling density than conventional precipitation 32 \nanalysis. Moss surveys have been repeated at five-yearly intervals and in this paper we report 33 \non the temporal trends in the concentration of arsenic, chromium, copper, iron, nickel, 34 \nvanadium and zinc between 1990 and 2000. Maps were produced of the metal concentration 35 \nin mosses for 1990, 1995 and 2000, showing the mean concentration per metal per 50 km x 36 \n50 km EMEP grid square. Metal- and country-specific temporal trends were observed. 37 \nAlthough the metal concentration in mosses generally decreased with time for all metals, only 38 \nthe decreases for arsenic, copper, vanadium and zinc were statistically significant. The 39 \nobserved temporal trends were compared with emission trends for Europe reported by EMEP 40 \n(Co-operative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-range Transmission of 41 \nAir Pollutant in Europe). 42 \n 43 \nKeywords: biomonitoring, EMEP maps, heavy metal, metal deposition, moss 44 \n 45 \n1. Introduction 46 \n 47 \n 3 \nThe heavy metals in mosses biomonitoring network was originally established as a 48 \nSwedish initiative (R\u00fchling and Sk\u00e4rby 1979; Tyler, 1970). The idea of using mosses to 49 \nmeasure atmospheric heavy metal deposition is based on the fact that ectohydric mosses 50 \nobtain most trace elements and nutrients directly from precipitation and dry deposition; there 51 \nis little uptake of metals from the substrate. The technique of moss analysis provides a 52 \nsurrogate, time-integrated measure of metal deposition from the atmosphere to terrestrial 53 \nsystems. It is easier and cheaper than conventional precipitation analysis as it avoids the need 54 \nfor deploying large numbers of precipitation collectors with an associated long-term 55 \nprogramme of routine sample collection and analysis. Therefore, a much higher sampling 56 \ndensity can be achieved than with conventional precipitation analysis. The higher trace 57 \nelement concentrations in mosses compared to rain water makes analysis more 58 \nstraightforward and less prone to contamination. In addition, heavy metal measurement data 59 \nfrom precipitation analysis can be very uncertain if the detection limits of the applied 60 \nanalytical technique are high (Ilyin et al., 2006). Despite improvement of the analytical 61 \ntechniques the latter remains a problem due to the general decline in anthropogenic emissions 62 \nand subsequent deposition of heavy metals in recent decades. Although the heavy metal 63 \nconcentration in mosses provides no direct quantitative measurement of deposition, this 64 \ninformation can be derived by using regression approaches relating the results from moss 65 \nsurveys to precipitation monitoring data (e.g. Berg and Steinnes, 1997; Berg et al., 2003). 66 \nThe moss survey has been repeated at five-yearly intervals and the number of 67 \nparticipating European countries has expanded greatly since 1990 (Buse et al., 2003; R\u00fchling, 68 \n1994; R\u00fchling and Steinnes, 1998). Currently, the 2005\/2006 moss survey is being conducted 69 \nin 32 countries, analysing moss samples from over 7 000 sites across Europe. For the first 70 \ntime the majority of countries (18) will also determine the nitrogen concentration in mosses 71 \n(ca. 3 200 sites), as a pilot study for selected Scandinavian countries has shown that there was 72 \n 4 \na good linear relationship between the total nitrogen concentration in mosses and atmospheric 73 \nnitrogen deposition rates (Harmens et al., 2005). During 2001, responsibility for the 74 \ncoordination of the moss survey was handed over from the Nordic Working Group on 75 \nMonitoring and Data, Nordic Council of Ministers, to the UNECE ICP Vegetation 76 \nCoordination Centre at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) Bangor, UK. 77 \nThe UNECE ICP Vegetation was established in the late 1980s to consider the science 78 \nfor quantifying damage to plants by air pollutants. It is one of seven ICPs and Task Forces 79 \nthat report to the Working Group on Effects of the Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution 80 \n(LRTAP) Convention on the effects of atmospheric pollutants on different components of the 81 \nenvironment (e.g. forests, fresh waters, buildings) and human health (Working Group on 82 \nEffects, 2004). The objectives of the ICP Vegetation (Harmens et al., 2006) are designed to 83 \nmeet the requirements of the LRTAP Convention, particularly at present the need to provide 84 \ninformation for the review of the 1999 Gothenburg Protocol to abate acidification, 85 \neutrophication and ground-level ozone and the 1998 Aarhus Protocol on heavy metals. The 86 \nlatter was the first Protocol for the control of emissions of heavy metals; cadmium, lead and 87 \nmercury emissions were targeted as they are the most toxic. 88 \nThe European moss survey provides data on concentrations of ten heavy metals (As, 89 \nCd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Ni, Pb, V, Zn) in naturally growing mosses (Buse et al., 2003; R\u00fchling, 90 \n1994; R\u00fchling and Steinnes, 1998). The main purpose of the survey is (a) to provide, in the 91 \nform of maps, spatial information on the distribution of heavy metal concentrations in mosses 92 \nin Europe, (b) identify main polluted areas, and (c) develop the understanding of long-range 93 \ntransboundary pollution. In general, there was a clear east\/west decrease in the concentration 94 \nof heavy metals in mosses, related in particular to industry. Former industrial or historic sites 95 \nof heavy metal pollution (e.g. mines) accounted for the location of some high concentrations 96 \nof heavy metals in mosses in areas without contemporary industries. Long-range 97 \n 5 \ntransboundary transport appears to account for elevated concentrations of heavy metals in 98 \nareas without emission sources (e.g. in Scandinavia). Many contributors to the survey have 99 \nreported their national data in greater detail elsewhere.  100 \n In this paper, we report on the temporal trends (1990 \u2013 2000) of arsenic, chromium, 101 \ncopper, iron, nickel, vanadium and zinc concentrations in mosses and these trends were 102 \ncompared with trends in anthropogenic emission data reported to EMEP (Ilyin et al., 2006; 103 \nTask Force on Heavy metals, 2006). In a previous paper we reported on the temporal trends of 104 \ncadmium, lead and mercury concentrations in mosses and the comparison with modelled 105 \ndeposition data reported by EMEP (Harmens et al., in press). 106 \n 107 \n2. Materials and methods 108 \n 109 \nMoss samples were collected across Europe in 1990\/1991 (R\u00fchling, 1994), 1995\/1996 110 \n(R\u00fchling and Steinnes, 1998) and 2000\/2001 (Buse et al., 2003; Harmens et al., 2004). 111 \nThroughout the paper we refer to the survey years as 1990, 1995 and 2000 respectively. The 112 \ncarpet-forming mosses Pleurozium schreberi and Hylocomium splendens were the preferred 113 \nspecies for analysis. However, since the mosses were collected in a range of habitats from the 114 \nsub-arctic climate of northern Sweden to the hot and dry climate of parts of southern Italy, it 115 \nwas inevitable that a wide range of moss species was sampled (Buse et al., 2003; Harmens et 116 \nal., 2004). The moss sampling procedure was according to the guidelines described in R\u00fchling 117 \n(1994) and R\u00fchling and Steinnes (1998) and was described in more detail in the protocol for 118 \nthe 2000 survey (ICP Vegetation, 2001). Only the last three years\u2019 growth of moss material 119 \nwas used for the analyses. The concentration of arsenic, chromium, copper, iron, nickel, 120 \nvanadium and zinc were determined by a range of analytical techniques, under the broad 121 \nheadings of atomic absorption spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (both 122 \n 6 \nICP optical emission spectrometry and ICP mass spectrometry), atomic fluorescence 123 \nspectrometry and neutron activation analysis. All metal concentrations were expressed as \u00b5g 124 \ng-1 dry weight at 40 oC. For further details on the methods and quality control procedures we 125 \nrefer to the reports of the individual surveys (Buse et al., 2003; R\u00fchling, 1994; R\u00fchling and 126 \nSteinnes, 1998). 127 \nFor each survey year EMEP maps were produced according to the method described 128 \nby Buse et al. (2003); they show the mean concentration of each metal within individual 129 \nEMEP grid squares (50 km x 50 km). Please note that the designations employed and the 130 \npresentation of material in this paper do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever 131 \non the part of the United Nations concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or 132 \narea or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. 133 \nStatistical analysis of the temporal trends (1990 \u2013 2000) across Europe was performed 134 \nby calculating the geometric mean values per metal per survey year for each country. 135 \nSubsequently, a general linear model ANOVA (Minitab version 14) was applied to each metal 136 \nusing only the geometric mean values for the countries which had determined the heavy metal 137 \nconcentration in mosses in all survey years for that metal. The geometric mean values were 138 \nanalysed with country as a factor, year as covariate and the number of samples as weights. 139 \nWeighting was applied to take into account the accuracy of the calculated geometric means 140 \n(i.e. the density of sampling varied between countries) and to give more weight to larger 141 \ncountries and less to smaller ones.  142 \n 143 \n3. Results 144 \n 145 \nThe concentration of heavy metals in mosses showed country- and metal-specific 146 \ntemporal trends between 1990 and 2000 (Tables 1-5, Figures 1-7).  147 \n 7 \n 148 \nArsenic (As) 149 \nOnly five countries determined the As concentration in mosses in all three survey years. For 150 \nthese countries, the As concentration declined significantly (P = 0.026) between 1990 and 151 \n2000 with the biggest decline between 1990 and 1995 (Figure 1, Tables 1, 4, 5). For these five 152 \ncountries, the highest As concentrations were found in mosses in the Czech Republic in all 153 \nsurvey years. However, 17 countries determined the As concentration in both 1995 and 2000 154 \nand for those countries the As concentration did not change significantly (P = 0.30) between 155 \n1995 and 2000 (Tables 4, 5). In the central European countries the mean As concentration in 156 \nmosses generally decreased with time (Figure 1). 157 \n 158 \nChromium (Cr) 159 \nAs for As, the mean Cr concentrations in mosses generally decreased with time in central 160 \nEuropean countries (Figure 2). However, the average median Cr concentration across Europe 161 \ndeclined by only 8% between 1990 and 2000 (Table 4) and no significant trend was found in 162 \nthe average geometric mean values for countries that analysed Cr in all survey years (Table 163 \n5). For some countries (Iceland, Italy, Lithuania, Slovakia, Spain and UK) the median Cr 164 \nconcentration in mosses increased between 1990 and 2000 (Table 1). The highest median Cr 165 \nconcentrations were found in Romania and Slovakia. 166 \n 167 \nCopper (Cu) 168 \nAlthough the year of survey significantly affected the average geometric mean Cu 169 \nconcentration in mosses (P = 0.026; Table 5), this was primarily due to a decline between 170 \n1990 and 1995. The decline in the average median value across Europe was only 16% 171 \nbetween 1990 and 2000 (Table 4). For some countries the decline was highest between 1990 172 \n 8 \nand 1995, for others between 1995 and 2000, whereas some countries showed no change or a 173 \nsmall, steady decline between 1990 and 2000 (Figure 3; Table 1). In quite a number of 174 \ncountries (Austria, Faroe Islands, France, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Switzerland and Ukraine) 175 \nthe median Cu concentration in mosses increased between 1990 (or 1995) and 2000 (Table 1). 176 \nThe highest median Cu concentrations were found in Bulgaria, The Netherlands, Romania 177 \nand Slovakia. 178 \n 179 \nIron (Fe) 180 \nThe average geometric mean Fe concentration in mosses decreased between 1990 and 1995, 181 \nbut increased again between 1995 and 2000, resulting in no significant change with time (P = 182 \n0.099; Table 5). The decrease between 1990 and 1995 was particularly observed in most of 183 \ncentral and eastern Europe (Figure 4; Table 3). The high Fe concentrations in mosses in 184 \nIceland are due to drift of volcanic ash and windblown soil dust. Extremely high Fe 185 \nconcentrations were also observed in Romania (due to local industry) and Spain (possibly due 186 \nto soil contamination by windblown dust) in 1990; the 1990 data for Spain are based on 187 \nsampling from only 8 sites. Overall, the decrease in the median Fe concentration in mosses 188 \nwas 44% between 1990 and 2000 (Table 4). 189 \n 190 \nNickel (Ni) 191 \nDespite a steady decline in the average geometric mean Ni concentration in mosses across 192 \nEurope between 1990 and 2000, the decline was not significant (P = 0.074; Table 5). The 193 \noverall decline in the median value was 30% (Table 4). For some countries the decline in the 194 \nmedian value was highest between 1990 and 1995, for others between 1995 and 2000 (Table 195 \n2). In quite a number of countries (Bulgaria, Faroe Islands, France, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, 196 \nSlovakia and Spain) the median value increased between 1990 (or 1995) and 2000. Unusually 197 \n 9 \nhigh median Ni concentrations were found in The Netherlands (due to the presence of 198 \nindustry and possibly analytical bias) and Portugal (due to the presence of industry and a 199 \ndense motorway network) in 1995. Only Germany and the area of St. Petersburg in the 200 \nRussian Federation showed a steady decline in the Ni concentration in mosses with time 201 \n(Figure 5; Table 2). 202 \n 203 \nVanadium (V) 204 \nThe average geometric mean V concentration in mosses declined steadily and significantly 205 \nbetween 1990 and 2000 (P = 0.000; Table 5), with an overall decline in the median value of 206 \n32% (Table 4). Despite the steady decline with time across Europe, country-specific changes 207 \nin the median values between 1990 and 1995 or 1995 and 2000 were observed, with decreases 208 \nbeing found in one time period but not the other (Figure 6; Table 2). In Poland (France, Italy 209 \nand Slovakia) the median V concentration in mosses actually increased between 1990 (1995 210 \nrespectively) and 2000, with no change being observed in Iceland and Lithuania. 211 \n 212 \nZinc (Zn) 213 \nThe average geometric mean Zn concentration in mosses declined significantly with time and 214 \nthe highest decline occurred between 1990 and 1995 (P = 0.021; Table 5). The overall decline 215 \nin the median value was 19% between 1990 and 2000 (Table 4). Nevertheless, country-216 \nspecific temporal trends were observed between the survey years, with even an increase in the 217 \nmedian Zn concentration being observed for Bulgaria, France, Hungary, Iceland, Italy and 218 \nRomania between 1990 (or 1995) and 2000 (Table 2). The maps show a clear decline in the 219 \nZn concentration in eastern Germany and an increase in France between 1995 and 2000 220 \n(Figure 7).  221 \n 222 \n 10 \n4. Discussion 223 \n 224 \nWhereas the arsenic, copper, vanadium and zinc concentration in mosses decreased 225 \nsignificantly (P \u2264 0.05) across Europe between 1990 and 2000, the decreases for chromium (P 226 \n= 0.180), iron (P= 0.099) and nickel (P = 0.074) were not significant. The observed decrease 227 \nfor arsenic was based on data for five countries only; no change in the arsenic concentration 228 \nin mosses was observed between 1995 and 2000 when comparing the data for 17 countries. 229 \nCountry-specific trends were observed for all the metals with decreases, no changes or even 230 \nincreases being observed between 1990 and 1995 or 2000 and between 1995 and 2000.  231 \nThe temporal trends for cadmium, lead and mercury were reported previously 232 \n(Harmens et al., in press): the cadmium and lead concentrations in mosses decreased 233 \nsignificantly between 1990 and 2000, but no significant change was observed for the mercury 234 \nconcentration in mosses between 1995 and 2000. The temporal trends for cadmium, lead and 235 \nmercury were similar to the temporal trends reported by EMEP regarding the modelled total 236 \ndeposition of these metals in Europe (Ilyin et al., 2005). Currently, no data are available for 237 \nthe modelled total deposition of other heavy metals across Europe. However, decreases in the 238 \nanthropogenic emission of metals according to official data combined with experts estimates 239 \nwere ca. 40, 25 and 55% for arsenic, chromium and nickel, respectively (Ilyin et al., 2006). 240 \nBetween 1995 and 2000 the decrease in the anthropogenic emission of arsenic was about 241 \n17%. In addition, the Task Force on Heavy Metals (2006) reported the following decreases in 242 \nanthropogenic emissions of copper and zinc between 1990 and 2000 for 17 European 243 \ncountries: ca. 24 and 27% respectively.  244 \nFor Europe as a whole total emission (including anthropogenic, natural and historical) 245 \nand deposition trends should be of a similar magnitude. At a smaller scale (regions, country, 246 \nprovinces etc.) the trends can be different, depending on local emissions, depositions from 247 \n 11 \nlong-range transport, meteorological peculiarities, site specific characteristics (e.g. Schr\u00f6der 248 \net al., in press) etc. However, when comparing deposition trends or the heavy metal 249 \nconcentrations in mosses with the trends in anthropogenic emissions, the latter should be 250 \nsteeper as the annual natural plus historical emissions are almost the same from year to year 251 \naccording to EMEP parameterizations (Ilyin, pers. comm.). This was indeed the case when 252 \ncomparing the temporal trends in the concentrations in mosses with the temporal trends in the 253 \nanthropogenic emissions reported by EMEP for As (between 1995 and 2000), Cr and Ni. For 254 \nplant essential trace elements such as copper and zinc the difference in temporal trends 255 \nbetween the concentrations in mosses and anthropogenic emissions would be expected to be 256 \neven bigger since mosses recycle these essential elements within the plant and have a 257 \nbackground level for essential trace elements. However, no big difference were observed at 258 \nthe European scale in the current study: 16 \u2013 19% decrease in the concentration in mosses 259 \ncompared to a 24 \u2013 27% decrease in anthropogenic emissions for copper and zinc reported by 260 \nthe Task Force on Heavy Metals (2006).  261 \n Other studies have reported in more detail on the temporal trends of the heavy metal 262 \nconcentrations in mosses at the national level, showing a decline for the majority of metals in 263 \nthe final decade(s) of the 20th century (e.g. Nikodemus et al., 2004; Poikolainen et al., 2004; 264 \nR\u00fchling and Tyler, 2004; Schr\u00f6der and Pesch, 2005; Steinnes et al., 2003; Suchara and 265 \nSucharov\u00e1, 2004). This decline can mainly be attributed to cleaner industries and road 266 \ntransport, but also to a decrease in domestic emissions (e.g. Poikolainen et al., 2004), resulting 267 \nin a significant decline in the deposition of heavy metals from long-range atmospheric 268 \ntransport (Poikolainen et al., 2004; R\u00fchling and Tyler, 2004; Steinnes et al., 2003). 269 \n For 2003, the following anthropogenic sources were identified as the main 270 \ncontributors to anthropogenic emissions for nine countries (Belgium, Finland, France, 271 \n 12 \nHungary, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Spain and the UK) across Europe (Task Force on Heavy 272 \nMetals, 2006): 273 \n\u2022 Arsenic:  Other, manufacturing industries and contructions (29%); 274 \nNon-ferrous metals (22%); 275 \n\u2022 Chromium: Metal production (23%); 276 \nOther, manufacturing industries and construction (22%); 277 \n\u2022 Copper: Road transportation (45%); 278 \nNon-ferrous metals (15%); 279 \n\u2022 Nickel: Petrol refining (33%); 280 \nPublic electricity and heat production (22%); 281 \n\u2022 Zinc:  Road transportation (42%); 282 \nMetal production (21%). 283 \nThe anthropogenic emission sources for cadmium, lead and mercury were described in detail 284 \nelsewhere (Harmens et al., in press). Although both nickel and vanadium are thought to derive 285 \nfrom crude oil combustion, the moss maps for these metals were quite different for the early 286 \nEuropean surveys; for the most recent survey in 2000 the maps for nickel and vanadium 287 \nappear to be more similar. Nevertheless, for the whole of Europe the vanadium to nickel ratio 288 \nin mosses did not change, based on the average median values for countries that determined 289 \nthe metals in both 1990 and 2000: 1.66 and 1.63 in 1990 and 2000 respectively. Differences 290 \nin nickel and vanadium deposition maps have also been reported at the national scale (e.g. 291 \nFowler et al., 2006).  292 \nWhen examining the results of the moss surveys it should be kept in mind that the 293 \nheavy metal concentrations in mosses do not directly reflect the total deposition of heavy 294 \nmetals. There are differences in the accumulation of individual heavy metals in mosses and 295 \nthe heavy metal concentrations in mosses are also affected by factors other than atmospheric 296 \n 13 \npollution. These factors were discussed in more detail by Harmens et al. (in press). However, 297 \nthe similarity in temporal trends reported for the data of the European moss survey and the 298 \nmodelled total depositions of cadmium, lead and mercury suggests that at the European scale 299 \nthe reported temporal trends for these metals were not affected by any potential confounding 300 \nfactors (Harmens et al., in press). 301 \n 302 \n5. Conclusions 303 \n 304 \nMosses provide a cheap and effective method for monitoring temporal trends in heavy 305 \nmetal pollution in Europe. Temporal trends in the concentrations of arsenic, chromium, 306 \ncopper, nickel and zinc in mosses were in agreement with those reported for anthropogenic 307 \nemissions of these metals in Europe. Reductions in anthropogenic emissions of heavy metals 308 \nbetween 1990 and 2000 have resulted in a significant reduction of the accumulation of 309 \narsenic, copper, vanadium and zinc in mosses. Decreases in the concentrations of chromium, 310 \niron and nickel in mosses with time were not significant. Therefore, the observed temporal 311 \ntrends in the concentration of heavy metals in mosses were metal-specific. In addition, many 312 \ntemporal trends were country-specific. 313 \n 314 \nAcknowledgements 315 \n 316 \nWe thank the United Kingdom Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 317 \n(Defra) for funding the ICP Vegetation Coordination Centre (contracts EPG 1\/3\/170, 1\/3\/205 318 \nand AQ03509).
