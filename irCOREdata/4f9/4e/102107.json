Introduction. In dynamical systems with symmetry, it is possible to obtain chaotic\nattractors with symmetry on average, where the symmetry of the attractor as a set is greater\nthan the symmetry of the individual points in the attractor. Such symmetric attractors were\nstudied by Chossat and Golubitsky [7], who also identi\ufb01ed a mechanism called symmetry-\nincreasing bifurcation, where distinct but symmetrically related chaotic attractors collide to\nproduce an attractor with greater symmetry. (This is related to the notion of crises [17].)\nSubsequent work on numerical and theoretical aspects of symmetric attractors includes [21,\n9, 23, 2, 11, 14, 20].\nHitherto, the notions of symmetric chaos and symmetry-increasing bifurcation have been\nseen as part of global, rather than local, bifurcation theory. In this paper, we show that a\nvariety of symmetry-increasing bifurcations between chaotic attractors occur in an (at \ufb01rst\nsight, simple) example in low-codimension, low-dimensional bifurcation theory. In contrast\nto codimension two bifurcations for nonsymmetric vector \ufb01elds [18, Chapter 7], the chaotic\n\u2217Received by the editors January 16, 2004; accepted for publication (in revised form) by M.

However, we note that the center manifold is at least\nfour-dimensional in these references. The center manifold here is three-dimensional and arises\nin a codimension two bifurcation with real eigenvalues, so in a sense this is the simplest local\nbifurcation in which chaotic dynamics is determined at \ufb01nite order.\nPerhaps of greater signi\ufb01cance is the extent\u2014both in phase space and in parameter space\u2014\nto which chaotic dynamics exists in the bifurcation studied in this paper. In phase space, our\nchaotic attractors are not merely thickenings of quasi-periodic attractors (see Figure 12) and\ncould not possibly be mistaken for such. In parameter space, the chaotic regions are not\nexponentially thin and can be found even by a casual numerical investigation. This is in\ncontrast to the weak chaos in [18, Chapter 7].\nIn this paper, we are not interested in the provable aspects of chaotic dynamical systems\ntheory; the large-scale chaos discussed in the previous paragraph is surely well beyond existing\nmethods of proof. Instead, our purpose is to use primarily numerical techniques to demon-\nstrate and investigate the extent of the chaos. Starting with analytic calculations to compute\nprimary branches of equilibria and secondary Hopf bifurcation points, we then use AUTO to\npath-follow the secondary branches of periodic solutions and compute the tertiary bifurcation\npoints. Using DsTool, it is easily seen that subsequent bifurcations lead to extensive chaotic\ndynamics, symmetric attractors, and symmetry-increasing bifurcations, as mentioned earlier.\nTo automate the investigation, we use maximal Lyapunov exponents to map out the chaotic\nregion in parameter space and symmetry detectives [4, 10] to map out the regions in parameter\nspace in which attractors of various symmetry types exist.\nThe speci\ufb01c bifurcation that we study is a codimension two steady-state\/steady-state\nmode interaction with D4 symmetry, where two independent steady-state bifurcations coalesce.\nWe assume that there is a simple zero eigenvalue and simultaneously a zero eigenvalue of\nmultiplicity two corresponding to the standard representation of D4. Hence, center manifold\nreduction leads to a three-dimensional vector \ufb01eld. The action of D4 on the center manifold R\n3\nis de\ufb01ned by\n\u03c1 : (x, y, w) \u0001\u2192 (\u2212y, x, w), \u03ba : (x, y, w) \u0001\u2192 (x,\u2212y,\u2212w).\nThus (x, y) transforms under the standard action of D4, while rotations act trivially on w.\nIt follows from standard arguments that there are three primary branches of equilibria with\nmaximal isotropy which we label Z4, D\ne\n1, and D\nv\n1. (These are cyclic subgroups generated by \u03c1,\n\u03ba, and \u03ba\u03c1, respectively. The superscripts e and v stand for \u201cedge\u201d and \u201cvertex,\u201d distinguishing\nthe two di\ufb00erent types of re\ufb02ection symmetry of a square\u2014axes through opposite edges and\naxes through opposite vertices.)\nIn a mode interaction, the primary branches may undergo secondary bifurcations to\nbranches of mixed-mode solutions. It turns out that all three of the primary branches above\nmay undergo secondary Hopf bifurcations leading to periodic solutions with trivial spatial\nisotropy and nontrivial spatiotemporal symmetry. In what follows, we disregard the Dv1 branch\nand focus on secondary bifurcations from the Z4 and D\ne\n1 branches. There is a scenario where\nboth the Z4 and D\ne\n1 branches lose stability to supercritical Hopf bifurcations.

Solid lines denote asymptotically stable solutions, and\ndashed lines denote unstable solutions.\nperiodic solutions have 14 and\n1\n2 phase shift symmetries, respectively. Since these periodic\nsolutions have di\ufb00erent phase shift symmetry, they cannot coalesce, and further tertiary bi-\nfurcations are required if the branches are to connect.\nThe situation up to this point is summarized in Figure 1. In Figure 1(a), we show the\n\u201cclassical\u201d bifurcation diagram for codimension two mode interactions, where there are non-\nhysteretic transitions between two primary branches of \u201cpure mode\u201d solutions via a secondary\nbranch of mixed-mode solutions. This particular diagram occurs in a steady-state\/steady-state\nbifurcation with Z2\u00d7Z2 symmetry [15, Figure 4.3(3), Chapter X]. (All branches here consist\nof equilibria, and, in the usual way, solid lines denote asymptotically stable solutions and\ndashed lines denote unstable solutions.)\nIn contrast, Figure 1(b) shows the bifurcation diagram for the steady-state\/steady-state\nbifurcation with D4 symmetry studied in this paper. The mixed-mode branches now consist of\nperiodic solutions, but more signi\ufb01cantly their spatiotemporal symmetries are di\ufb00erent, and\nso the bifurcation diagram cannot be complete.\nSurprisingly, we \ufb01nd that the missing portion of the bifurcation diagram in Figure 1(b)\ntakes the form of symmetric chaos. Indeed, we compute the existence of attractors with\nsymmetry on average Dv1 and D4, as well as asymmetric chaotic attractors, and we compute\ntransitions between these di\ufb00erent types of chaotic attractor. (We also \ufb01nd chaotic attractors\nwith symmetry De1 and D\ne\n2, but we do not focus on these here.)\nSymmetric chaos has been previously seen in D4 symmetric Takens\u2013Bogdanov bifurcations\n(codimension two bifurcation, four-dimensional center manifold) [1, 25]. Armbruster, Guck-\nenheimer, and Kim [1] found a \u201cweakly chaotic\u201d symmetric attractor, though the symmetry\nwas not mentioned explicitly. In the same situation, Rucklidge [25] made an extensive study\nof symmetric chaos and symmetry-increasing bifurcations, though the analysis was restricted\nto parameters near an O(2) symmetric limit, so the e\ufb00ective codimension was three.\nThe mode interaction that we study has been partially analyzed in previous work of\nLari-Lavassani et al. [22, section 4.2]. In particular, [22] pointed out that the existence\nof secondary periodic solutions bifurcating from the Z4 equilibria should be expected on\nrepresentation-theoretic grounds. There are no general principles that predict the nature\nof secondary bifurcations from the remaining primary branches, but concrete calculations\nSYMMETRIC CHAOS IN A LOCAL BIFURCATION 35\nshow that both secondary steady-state and Hopf bifurcations can occur depending on the\ndetails of the bifurcation problem. These bifurcations and the existence of symmetric chaos\nand symmetry-increasing bifurcations were not studied in [22].\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The analytic computations, which\nsu\ufb03ce for the primary and secondary bifurcations, are carried out in section 2. Tertiary\nbifurcations are analyzed using AUTO [12] and DsTool [3] in section 3. In sections 4 and 5,\nthe existence of symmetric chaotic attractors is established by computing Lyapunov exponents\nand symmetry detectives [4, 10]. In section 6, we summarize our results and describe possible\nfuture directions.\n2. Primary and secondary bifurcations. We begin by writing the general form of the\nvector \ufb01eld on the center manifold.\nProposition 2.1. The general smooth D4-equivariant mapping f : R\n3 \u2192 R3 has the form\nf1(x, y, w) = h1(x\n2, y2, w2)x\u2212 h2(x2, y2, w2)wy,\nf2(x, y, w) = h1(y\n2, x2, w2)y + h2(y\n2, x2, w2)wx,\nf3(x, y, w) = h3(x\n2 + y2, x2y2, w2)w + h4(x\n2 + y2, x2y2, w2)xy(x2 \u2212 y2),\nwhere h1, h2, h3, h4 are smooth real-valued functions.\nProof. This is standard, as in [16].\nIn this paper, we consider the truncated vector \ufb01eld\nx\u02d9 = (\u03bb\u2212 x2 + by2 + dw2)x\u2212 wy,\ny\u02d9 = (\u03bb\u2212 y2 + bx2 + dw2)y + wx,\nw\u02d9 = (\u00b5+ c(x2 + y2)\u2212 w2)w + exy(x2 \u2212 y2).\n\u23ab\u23aa\u23ac\n\u23aa\u23ad(2.1)\nIn the usual way, certain (generically nonzero) coe\ufb03cients can be normalized to \u00b11, and we\nhave chosen \u22121 to ensure that certain primary branches are supercritical.\nRemark 2.2. For computations of equilibria, it is possible to use singularity theory to\n\ufb01nd a suitable truncation of these equations. Recent techniques [6] make the application\nof singularity theory more tractable. For our situation, a computation [5] shows that the\nbifurcating equilibria are determined by the vector \ufb01eld (2.1) with d = e = 0. However, this\nleads to degenerate secondary Hopf bifurcations, necessitating nonzero values for d and e.\nIsotropy subgroups. The isotropy subgroups are given up to conjugacy by D4, Z4, D\ne\n1, D\nv\n1,\nand 1, with the following lattice of inclusions:\nD4\nZ4 D\ne\n1 D\nv\n1\n1\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0002\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0004\u0005\n\u0002\n\u0002\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0004\u0005\nThe proper isotropy subgroups Z4, D\ne\n1, and D\nv\n1 have one-dimensional \ufb01xed-point subspaces:\nFixZ4 = {(0, 0, w)}, FixDe1 = {(x, 0, 0)}, FixDv1 = {(x, x, 0)}.\n36 STELLA ABREU, PHILIP ASTON, AND IAN MELBOURNE\nPrimary bifurcations.

The Z4 equilibria exist for \u00b5 > 0. They are asymptotically stable if \u03bb +\nd\u00b5 < 0 and unstable if \u03bb+ d\u00b5 > 0.\nThe De1 equilibria exist for \u03bb > 0. They are asymptotically stable if\n\u00b5+ (1 + b+ c)\u03bb < 0, (1 + b)\u00b5+ ((1 + b)c\u2212 e)\u03bb > 0\nand are unstable if one or both of these inequalities is reversed.\nThe Dv1 equilibria exist for \u03bb > 0 provided b < 1, in which case they are asymptotically\nstable if\n(1\u2212 b)\u00b5\u2212 2(1 + b\u2212 c)\u03bb < 0, (b2 \u2212 1)\u00b5+ 2(e\u2212 (1 + b)c)\u03bb > 0\nand are unstable if one or both of these inequalities is reversed.\nSecondary bifurcations. Next, we describe the secondary bifurcations of equilibria and\nperiodic solutions that bifurcate from the three primary branches of equilibria.\nTable 1 gives information on the eigenvalues associated to the three primary branches of\nequilibria. Secondary bifurcations occur when the real parts of the eigenvalues vanish. Zero\neigenvalues signify steady-state bifurcation to secondary branches of equilibria, and imaginary\neigenvalues signify Hopf bifurcation to secondary branches of periodic solutions.\nProposition 2.4. (a) Secondary branches of equilibria bifurcate from the primary branches\nof equilibria as follows:\nZ4 None.\nD\ne\n1 At (1 + b)\u00b5+ ((1 + b)c\u2212 e)\u03bb = 0.\nD\nv\n1 At (b\n2 \u2212 1)\u00b5+ 2(e\u2212 (1 + b)c)\u03bb = 0.\nThese secondary bifurcations are pitchfork bifurcations, and the bifurcating equilibria have\ntrivial isotropy.\n(b) Secondary branches of periodic solutions bifurcate from the primary branches of equi-\nlibria as follows:\nZ4 At \u03bb+ d\u00b5 = 0.\nD\ne\n1 At \u00b5+ (1 + b+ c)\u03bb = 0 provided (1 + b)\n2 + e < 0.\nD\nv\n1 At (1\u2212 b)\u00b5\u2212 2(1 + b\u2212 c)\u03bb = 0 provided \u2212(1 + b)2 + e > 0.\nSYMMETRIC CHAOS IN A LOCAL BIFURCATION 37\nThe resulting periodic solutions have trivial spatial symmetry and spatiotemporal symmetry\nZ4, D\ne\n1, and D\nv\n1, respectively. For example, the Z4 branch has quarter-period phase shift\nsymmetry coupled with the action of \u03c1.\nProof. The eigenvalues for Z4 are given explicitly in Table 1, so the secondary bifurcations\nare immediate. The results for De1 and D\nv\n1 are obtained by noting that for a 2\u00d72 matrix, zero\neigenvalues are signi\ufb01ed by detA = 0 and imaginary eigenvalues are signi\ufb01ed by trA = 0,\ndetA > 0.\nFinally, the results on spatiotemporal symmetry are a consequence of the equivariant Hopf\ntheorem [16].\nIt follows from general principles that the secondary branches of equilibria and periodic\nsolutions in Proposition 2.4 satisfy \u201cexchange of stability,\u201d so their stability is governed by\nthe stability of the primary branch together with the branching direction. Computing the\ndirection of branching is elementary but tedious. We focus on asymptotically stable periodic\nsolutions bifurcating from the Z4 and D\ne\n1 branches.\nLemma 2.5. If b + 4cd < 3, then the Z4 periodic solutions bifurcate supercritically (for\n\u03bb+ d\u00b5 > 0) and are asymptotically stable. If\n(1 + b)2 + e < 0 and (1 + b)(2b3 + 3b2 \u2212 3b+ 2be+ 3bc+ 2ce+ 2b2c) > 0,\nthen the De1 periodic solutions bifurcate supercritically (for \u00b5 + (1 + b + c)\u03bb > 0) and are\nasymptotically stable.\nIf the appropriate inequality is reversed, then the corresponding periodic solutions exist\nsubcritically and are unstable.\nThe proof is given in the appendix.\n3. Tertiary bifurcations. To compute the loss of stability of the secondary branches of\nperiodic solutions, and the onset of symmetric chaos, it is necessary to use numerical methods.\nFrom now on, we specify the values of the constants b, c, d, e in the vector \ufb01eld (2.1) as follows:\nb = 0.9, c = \u22122.1, d = \u22120.05, e = \u221219.2.\nWe concentrate on the positive quadrant \u03bb, \u00b5 > 0 of parameter space. Applying the results\nof section 2 with these values, we \ufb01nd that the primary branches of equilibria with Z4 and D\ne\n1\nsymmetry are initially asymptotically stable, and each undergo supercritical Hopf bifurca-\ntion to secondary branches of periodic solutions with spatiotemporal Z4 and D\ne\n1 symmetry.\nThe Hopf bifurcations occur at \u00b5 = 20\u03bb and \u00b5 = 0.2\u03bb, respectively. Primary branches of\nD\nv\n1 equilibria exist but are unstable.\nIn this section, we use AUTO and DsTool to study the dynamics that occurs when the\nsecondary branches of Z4 and D\ne\n1 symmetric periodic solutions lose stability.\nLoss of stability of the secondary periodic solutions. In this subsection, we use AUTO\n[12] to determine curves in \u03bb-\u00b5 parameter space where tertiary bifurcations take place from\nthe secondary branches of periodic solutions. At the same time, we determine the manner in\nwhich the periodic solutions lose stability.\nThe use of AUTO is slightly nonstandard due to the spatiotemporal symmetry of the\nperiodic solutions. Standard implementation of AUTO leads to bifurcations that AUTO\ncannot recognize, and so the approach must be modi\ufb01ed as described below.\n38 STELLA ABREU, PHILIP ASTON, AND IAN MELBOURNE\nZ4 periodic solutions. The Z4 periodic solutions have spatiotemporal symmetry\n(x, y, w)(t+ T\/4) = \u03c1 \u00b7 (x, y, w)(t) = (\u2212y, x, w)(t),\nwhere T is the period of the periodic solution.\nSolutions with this symmetry type can be computed numerically by constructing a modi-\n\ufb01ed Poincare\u00b4 map P . Let X be a local two-dimensional cross-section. Let g : X \u2192 \u03c1X be the\n\ufb01rst hit map and de\ufb01ne P = \u03c1\u22121g : X \u2192 X. Then periodic solutions with Z4 spatiotemporal\nsymmetry correspond to \ufb01xed points of P . In practice, we chose X to be contained in the\nplane {w = c} for some constant c and computed g by using an initial value solver to deter-\nmine the next intersection of the orbit with this plane. Mapping the intersection point back\nunder the action of \u03c1\u22121 gives the de\ufb01nition of the map P for which AUTO seeks \ufb01xed points.\nWorking with P is more e\ufb03cient numerically than working with the usual Poincare\u00b4 map since\nit is su\ufb03cient to compute only one quarter of the solution. More signi\ufb01cantly, the bifurcations\nfor P are the generic ones, though the consequences for the \ufb02ow must be interpreted with\ncare; see Remark 3.1 below.\nTo compute the solutions, we used AUTO to \ufb01nd \ufb01xed points of P , starting with a solution\nnear the Hopf bifurcation point. By increasing \u03bb, a path of periodic solutions was computed,\nand it was found that the solutions on this path lost stability at a turning point. Two-\nparameter continuation was used to follow the path of turning points in the two-parameter\n(\u03bb, \u00b5) space shown in Figure 2.\nD\ne\n1 periodic solutions. The D\ne\n1 periodic solutions have spatiotemporal symmetry\n(x, y, w)(t+ T\/2) = \u03ba \u00b7 (x, y, w)(t) = (x,\u2212y,\u2212w)(t).\nWe again consider a local cross-section X and let g : X \u2192 \u03baX denote the \ufb01rst hit map.\nPeriodic solutions with De1 symmetry correspond to \ufb01xed points for the modi\ufb01ed Poincare\u00b4\nmap P = \u03bag : X \u2192 X. As in the previous case, we chose X to be contained in the plane\n{w = c} and used a similar approach to construct the map in AUTO.\nUsing AUTO, we found that the path of stable \ufb01xed points for P loses stability via a\nperiod-doubling bifurcation. For the underlying \ufb02ow, this corresponds to a symmetry-breaking\npitchfork bifurcation to nonsymmetric periodic solutions. The path of bifurcations is shown\nin the (\u03bb, \u00b5) plane in Figure 2.\nRemark 3.1. We note that this is not a period-doubling bifurcation for the \ufb02ow and is\nan example of \u201csuppression of period-doubling\u201d [26]. In fact, the bifurcating nonsymmetric\nperiodic solutions are approximately of the same period as the De1 periodic solutions near the\nbifurcation point.\nIf we had ignored the spatiotemporal symmetry, then the ordinary Poincare\u00b4 map obtained\nby integrating around the full periodic solution would have an eigenvalue 1 at the bifurcation\npoint, but the bifurcation is a pitchfork rather than a turning point. This is a highly degenerate\nbifurcation in systems without symmetry and is not recognized by AUTO.\nThe pitchfork bifurcation to nonsymmetric periodic solutions turns out to be subcritical,\nresulting in unstable solutions initially. However, there is almost immediately a turning point\nat which they regain stability. The corresponding hysteretic region of bistability is extremely\nthin. The turning point is quickly followed by a period-doubling cascade. We computed the\nSYMMETRIC CHAOS IN A LOCAL BIFURCATION 39\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2\n\u03bb\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n\u00b5\nZ4 equilibrium\nZ4 periodic\nD1\ne\n periodic\nD1\ne\n equilibrium\nHopf bifurcation\nHopf bifurcation\npitchfork bifurcation, and\nperiod-doubling bifurcation\nturning point\nFigure 2.

The thin hysteretic region where stable\nD\ne\n1 periodic solutions and asymmetric periodic solutions coexist is not shown (the curve of\nturning points where the asymmetric periodic solutions gain stability is omitted), but the\ndashed curve shows the path of \ufb01rst period-doubling bifurcations for the asymmetric periodic\nsolutions.\nChaotic transitions. In this subsection, we explore the nature of the tertiary transitions\nusing DsTool [3]. Throughout, we \ufb01x \u03bb = .16 and vary \u00b5.\nPeriodic solutions with spatiotemporal symmetry De1 and Z4 are shown in Figures 6 and 7.\nThe parameter values are \u00b5 = .68 and \u00b5 = .82, respectively.\nThe turning point loss of stability for the Z4 periodic solutions takes place near \u00b5 = .8186.\nExperiments with DsTool indicate that at the turning point there is a hysteretic transition to\na D4 symmetric chaotic attractor. Bistability between Z4 symmetric periodic attractors and\n40 STELLA ABREU, PHILIP ASTON, AND IAN MELBOURNE\nD4 symmetric chaotic attractors occurs for values of \u00b5 roughly in the range .8186 < \u00b5 < .8202.\nThe D4 symmetric attractor persists until near \u00b5 = .739, after which point there is a collapse\nto a Dv1 symmetric chaotic attractor. Varying \u00b5 in the other direction, it can be seen that\nthis is a symmetry-increasing bifurcation from Dv1 to D4 symmetric chaos. The D4 and D\nv\n1\nsymmetric attractors for \u00b5 = .74 and \u00b5 = .73 are shown in Figures 8 and 10. As \u00b5 increases\nfrom .73 to .74, four symmetry-related Dv1 symmetric attractors (one of which is shown in\nFigure 10) collide to form the single fully D4 symmetric attractor shown in Figure 8.\nIn Figure 9, we show an amalgamation of the De1 and Z4 periodic solutions from Figures\n6 and 7, together with their symmetry-related images. This should be compared with the\nD4 symmetric chaotic attractor in Figure 8.\nTurning to the De1 periodic solutions, the subcritical pitchfork bifurcation to unstable\nnonsymmetric periodic solutions occurs at \u00b5 = .6835. Asymptotically stable nonsymmetric\nperiodic solutions exist for .6821 \u2264 \u00b5 \u2264 .6869 with a period-doubling bifurcation at \u00b5 = .6869.\nExperiments with DsTool indicate that a sequence of period-doubling bifurcations follows,\nleading to a nonsymmetric chaotic attractor at around \u00b5 = .688. There is then a symmetry-\nincreasing bifurcation at around \u00b5 = .6891 to a fully D4 symmetric chaotic attractor. (We\ncaution the reader that there is a long transient at this parameter value where the attractor\nappears to have only Dv1 symmetry.)\nThe ensuing region of parameter space seems to be extremely complicated with numerous\ntransitions between periodic\/chaotic solutions with\/without Dv1 symmetry. The transitions\ntake the form of period-doubling sequences, gluing bifurcations and symmetry-increasing bi-\nfurcations. Periodic solutions with no symmetry and with Dv1 symmetry are shown in Fig-\nure 11.\nEventually, a region of parameter space is reached (.720 \u2264 \u00b5 \u2264 .738) where Dv1 sym-\nmetric chaotic attractors appear to dominate. This region terminates in the aforementioned\nsymmetry-increasing bifurcation to the D4 symmetric attractor.\nIt is not entirely clear from Figure 8 that the chaotic attractor at \u03bb = 0.16, \u00b5 = 0.74\nis fully D4 symmetric as claimed. In fact, it is hard to plot a trajectory of su\ufb03cient length\nto resolve this issue. (There are 200,000 data points, but our time step is 0.01, so the total\nintegration time is only 2000 time units.) In Figure 12, we show the same attractor but now\nin terms of pixels hit by the trajectory. There is no longer a data-storage di\ufb03culty, and we use\n100,000,000 data points (corresponding to a total integration time of 1,000,000 time units).\nThe symmetries are now clear. Also, we color the pixels according to how often the pixel is\nhit. This gives an idea of the density function for the invariant measure.\n4. Lyapunov exponents. Our analytic calculations, and the computations using AUTO,\nleave a large region of parameter space unexplored. The simulations using DsTool indicate that\nthere are chaotic attractors throughout much of this region. To con\ufb01rm this we computed the\nmaximal Lyapunov exponent for a \ufb01xed initial condition (chosen arbitrarily to be (x, y, w) =\n(0.008, 0.044, 0.005)) and a grid of values of \u03bb and \u00b5. Our results are shown in Figure 3.\nMost of Figure 3 was obtained by varying \u03bb from 0 to 0.2 in increments of 0.002, and\nvarying \u00b5 from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.01. To obtain greater resolution near the origin, and\nto convince ourselves that the chaotic region goes all the way to the origin in parameter space,\nwe zoomed in for 0 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 0.042, using increments of 0.002 for \u00b5.\nSYMMETRIC CHAOS IN A LOCAL BIFURCATION 41\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2\n\u03bb\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n\u00b5\nFigure 3.

The boundaries of the regions studied analytically and using AUTO\n(cf. Figure 2) are also shown.\nFor each point in the (\u03bb, \u00b5) grid, we allowed a transient of 20,000 time units and then\ncomputed the maximal Lyapunov exponent over the next 10,000 time units, using a time step\nof 0.01. The exact numerical values of these \ufb01nite-time Lyapunov exponents are of course\nmeaningless\u2014for such small values of the parameters, 10,000 time units is unlikely to be\nsu\ufb03cient to provide an accurate estimate. Our aim is not to estimate the actual value of the\nLyapunov exponents but only to determine whether the dynamics is chaotic or not. For this\npurpose, we found that 10,000 time units su\ufb03ce. Indeed, there was a clear cuto\ufb00 between\n\u201cpositive\u201d and \u201czero\u201d values of the Lyapunov exponent, with the value 0.001 su\ufb03cing.

In addition, we have compared the results of the\n42 STELLA ABREU, PHILIP ASTON, AND IAN MELBOURNE\nLyapunov exponent calculation with simulations using DsTool (both along slices in parameter\nspace and at certain nonchaotic windows indicated in Figure 3) and found no discrepancies.\n5. Symmetry detectives. Symmetry detectives [4, 10] are a method for numerically com-\nputing the symmetry of an attractor. In general, there are two advantages to proceeding in\nthis way:\n(i) For high-dimensional dynamical systems and complicated symmetry groups, it might\nbe hard to determine the symmetries visually.\n(ii) The approach can be automated and so can deal with a large number of parameter\nvalues, producing a detailed map of parameter space.\nIn principle, it is not hard to determine the symmetry of a chaotic attractor for the three-\ndimensional vector \ufb01eld (2.1) by looking at the projections into the (x, y) plane. The detective\napproach is used here primarily because of advantage (ii).\nThe problem is to determine numerically the symmetries inside D4 that preserve a set A\nin R3. As shown in Barany, Dellnitz, and Golubitsky [4], this can be done by converting the\nset A into a point \u03c8A in some higher-dimensional representation space V for D4 and then\ncomputing the symmetry of the point \u03c8A. The key property of V is that every subgroup of D4\nshould be an isotropy subgroup for the action of D4 on V .\nWe take the representation space V = R5 with coordinates v = (v1, . . . , v5), where the\naction of D4 is de\ufb01ned by\n\u03c1 \u00b7 v = (v1,\u2212v2,\u2212v3,\u2212v5, v4), \u03ba \u00b7 v = (\u2212v1, v2,\u2212v3, v4,\u2212v5).\nNote that V splits up into three distinct nontrivial one-dimensional representations R{v1},\nR{v2}, and R{v3} and the standard two-dimensional representation R{v4, v5}.\nUp to conjugacy, there are eight subgroups of D4. Six of these are normal subgroups with\n\ufb01xed-point subspaces in V given by\nFixD4 = {0}, FixDe2 = R{v2}, FixDv2 = R{v3},\nFixZ4 = R{v1}, FixZ2 = R{v1, v2, v3}, Fix1 = V.\nThe remaining subgroups De1 and D\nv\n1 each have two conjugate copies (conjugated by \u03c1), and\nthe union of \ufb01xed-point spaces is a pair of planes in each case:\nFixDe1 = R{v2, v4} \u222a R{v2, v5}, FixDv1 = R{v3, v4 + v5} \u222a R{v3, v4 \u2212 v5}.\nThese \ufb01xed-point spaces are distinct, so each subgroup of D4 is indeed an isotropy subgroup\nfor the action on V .\nNext, we de\ufb01ne the detective\n\u03c6(x, y, w) = (w, xyw, xy, x, y).\nIt is easy to see that \u03c6 : R3 \u2192 V is D4-equivariant with respect to the given actions of D4 on\nR\n3 and V . In addition, \u03c6 is a polynomial map, and each component of \u03c6 is nonzero. Hence\n\u03c6 satis\ufb01es the hypotheses of [4, Theorem 5.2].\nSYMMETRIC CHAOS IN A LOCAL BIFURCATION 43\nAt this point we switch to the numerically more e\ufb03cient method developed by Dellnitz,\nGolubitsky, and Nicol [10]. Given an attractor A with trajectory u(t), we de\ufb01ne\n\u03c8A = lim\nT\u2192\u221e\n1\nT\n\u222b T\n0\n\u03c6(u(t)) dt.\nIt follows from the ergodic theorem that \u03c8A \u2208 V is well de\ufb01ned for almost every initial condi-\ntion u(0), and the point \u03c8A inherits the symmetry of the set A (under reasonable but technical\nhypotheses about the ergodic measures on A). Moreover, it follows from the properties of \u03c6\n(being a detective) that typically, the symmetry of \u03c8A is identical to the symmetry of A.\nIt remains to compute the distance of \u03c8A from the various \ufb01xed-point spaces and hence\nto determine the symmetry of A. Of many possible algorithms, we chose the following:\n(i) If v21 + v\n2\n2 + v\n2\n3 + v\n2\n4 + v\n2\n5 = 0, then D4.\n(ii) Else, if v22 + v\n2\n3 + v\n2\n4 + v\n2\n5 = 0, then Z4.\n(iii) Else, if v21 + v\n2\n3 + v\n2\n4 + v\n2\n5 = 0, then D\ne\n2.\n(iv) Else, if v21 + v\n2\n2 + v\n2\n4 + v\n2\n5 = 0, then D\nv\n2.\n(v) Else, if v24 + v\n2\n5 = 0, then Z2.\n(vi) Else, if v21 > 0, then 1.\n(vii) Else, if v23 > 0, then D\nv\n1.\n(viii) Else, De1.\n(In practice, we have to choose the range of values that numerically constitutes zero.)\nOur results are shown in Figure 4. These are based on the same initial conditions for\n(x, y, w) and the same values of (\u03bb, \u00b5) in parameter space that were used in computing Lya-\npunov exponents in Figure 3. Again, we used time step 0.01 and transient 20,000 time units,\nbut we integrate for the longer time of 100,000 time units. This is necessary to distinguish\nD4 chaotic attractors from D\nv\n1 chaotic attractors near the symmetry-increasing bifurcations.\nIn numerical simulations, the chaos is seen immediately, but it sometimes takes longer to see\nthe fully symmetric attractor.\nIn Figure 5, we show a blown-up version of part of Figure 4.\n6. Conclusions and future directions. In this paper, we have studied a simple-looking\ncodimension two mode interaction with D4 symmetry. The codimension two point is the coa-\nlescence of two steady-state bifurcation points, and the center manifold is three-dimensional.\nWe computed analytically primary branches of equilibria with maximal isotropy giving\nrise through Hopf bifurcation to secondary branches of periodic solutions with spatiotemporal\nsymmetry.\nSurprisingly, we found tertiary bifurcations leading to symmetric chaos. Using AUTO,\nDsTool, Lyapunov exponents, and symmetry detectives, we obtained convincing numerical\nevidence that the symmetric chaos is part of the local bifurcation, as is various symmetry-\nincreasing bifurcations between chaotic attractors of di\ufb00ering symmetry types.\nThere are three natural directions that are worthy of further study:\n\u2022 The corresponding bifurcations with Dn symmetry for n \u0006= 4 are only partially studied.\nFrom now on, we write D1 as shorthand for D\nv\n1 and D\ne\n1 when n is even and for the\nunique subgroup of order two (up to conjugacy) when n is odd. The primary branches\nof equilibria with Zn and D1 symmetry are essentially unchanged, and there is still a\n44 STELLA ABREU, PHILIP ASTON, AND IAN MELBOURNE\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2\n\u03bb\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n\u00b5\nD4\nD1\nv\n1\nD1\ne\nZ4 equilibrium\nZ4 periodic\nD1\ne\n periodic\nD1\ne\n equilibrium\nFigure 4.

However, a calculation for n \u2265 5 shows that generically the D1 equilibria\nlose stability only via a steady-state bifurcation, hence producing a secondary branch\nof asymmetric equilibria. In general, the cases n \u2265 5 are likely to be simpler than\nthe case n = 4 studied in this paper, since various important terms are now at higher\norder. The case n = 3 is potentially even more complicated than n = 4 since there are\nnow additional terms at cubic order.\nWe have not carried out the numerical simulations required to determine the existence\nof large-scale symmetric chaos and symmetry-increasing bifurcations when n = 3 and\nn \u2265 5.\n\u2022 It should be straightforward to write a system of reaction-di\ufb00usion equations in a\nsquare domain undergoing the steady-state\/steady-state mode interaction studied in\nthis paper.
