Introduction \nThe promotion of small-scale entrepreneurship, as a means to alleviate poverty, has recently \nreceived increased attention given the rapid spread of microfinance institutions throughout the developing \nworld. By extending credit to those who lack access to formal financial markets, organizations such as the \nGrameen Bank in Bangladesh, BancoSol in Bolivia and Bank Rayat in Indonesia have demonstrated how \nthe innovative use of group lending with joint liability can be used to promote small-scale \nentrepreneurship (Morduch, 1999; Pitt and Khandker, 1998). The success of these programs relies heavily \non the notion that borrowers can utilize their social capital to overcome many of the problems associated \nwith asymmetric information in credit markets (e.g., adverse selection, moral hazard, state verification \nand contract enforcement).  \nWhile microfinance has its roots in Bangladesh and elsewhere, its application has not been \nrestricted solely to the developing world (OECD, 1995). In North America, microfinance has received \nwidespread support from rather disparate constituencies as a tool for lifting individuals out of poverty and \naddressing deprivation in economically depressed urban areas and aboriginal communities.1  Individually \ntargeted microfinance schemes such as Working Capital in Boston and Calmeadow in Toronto have been \noperative for close to a decade. Other approaches, such as those of the South Shore Bank in Chicago and \nthe Good Faith Fund in Arkansas have sought to (re)establish financial intermediaries in communities \nabandoned by traditional banking institutions. Yet, despite the widespread implementation of such \nmicrocredit schemes throughout the continent, there is surprisingly little empirical work that accurately \nassesses their impact on either individual borrowers or communities.  Consequently, beliefs in the \neffectiveness of microcredit are often based on unfounded expectations about the viability of small-scale \nself-employment2 for the unemployed or those on social assistance. According to Morduch (1999) \u201cWhile \nstrong claims are made for the ability of microfinance to reduce poverty, only a handful of studies use \nsizeable samples and appropriate treatment\/control frameworks to answer the question.\u201d   \nGiven the dearth of both available data and theoretical models of the social and economic \nprocesses that affect the performance of entrepreneurs who access microfinance institutions, there is an \n 2\nincreasing need for studies that: (1) estimate the effect of microfinance programs on earnings; (2) analyze \nthe functioning of the group lending process; and more generally, (3) examine the determinants of \nmicroborrower success. These three issues, while appearing simple, have received only limited empirical \nconfirmation in the academic literature.3\nThe present paper attempts to fill part of the void in the microfinance literature by examining the \nthird question listed above. A unique cross-sectional data set is used to explore and describe the outcomes \nof microfinance programs (something which we know little about) and to estimate the economic returns \nto social capital accumulation. The data are drawn from a survey designed and administered by the \nauthors, in combination with administrative files for small-scale self-employed individuals who accessed \ncredit from Calmeadow Metrofund, which is Canada\u2019s largest non-profit microlending institution. \nEmpirically, we demonstrate that social capital, as proxied by membership in civil society, contributes \npositively to the self-employment earnings of microfinance borrowers.  This suggests that otherwise \nsimilar individuals (e.g., individuals with the same levels of human capital and other observable \ncharacteristics) do not \u2018profit\u2019 equally from the provision of microcredit. This is an important finding for \ntwo reasons. First, our results establish a microeconomic foundation for the effect of social capital on \nimproved economic performance, something that until recently had been neglected in much of the \nmainstream social capital literature. Second, this result has positive implications for microfinance \ninstitutions that rely heavily on the idea that individual social capital can overcome a borrower\u2019s lack of \nfinancial collateral. \nThe paper is structured as follows: section 2 presents the model to be tested and then establishes a \ntheoretical framework that first operationalizes the contentious issue of social capital and then explores \nthe links between social capital, neighbourhood effects and small-scale self-employment success. Section \n3 describes the survey and data. A discussion of the measurement and methodological issues surrounding \nsocial capital and its effect on earnings follows.  Section 4 specifies the empirical approach and key \nexplanatory measures while section 5 presents and discusses the results. Finally, section 6 provides \nconcluding comments and suggests avenues for further research.  \n 3\n2.  Model Specifications and Theoretical Framework \nThe Model \nA lengthy literature has examined the determinants of self-employment earnings, with particular \nattention paid to estimating the returns to human capital. 4   However, this modeling strategy may not be \nappropriate for assessing the returns to self-employment for microfinance borrowers since human capital \nrarely plays a critical role in the process by which microfinance institutions extend credit.  Rather, due to \nthe group lending process \u2013 which involves the dispensing of loans to applicants who enter into a contract \nto monitor and support each member of the borrower group -- microfinance institutions place a higher \npremium on an individual\u2019s social capital. Likewise, given the nature of small-scale employment activity \n-- which is often rooted in home-based local entrepreneurship -- neighbourhood characteristics also matter \ngreatly. Therefore, to assess the returns to the microfinance-supported self-employed, a conventional \nreduced-form human capital earnings equation can be augmented to include social capital measures and \nneighbourhood characteristics: \n     y = \u03b1 + \u03b21H + \u03b22 S + \u03b23 N + \u03b24 X +  \u03b5                  (1) \nwhere y is log net earnings, H is a vector of human capital measures, S is a vector of social capital \nmeasures, N is a vector of neighbourhood characteristics and X is a vector of standard individual, \ndemographic and business characteristics.  If social capital matters then all elements of \u03b22 should be \npositive and significant in any empirical estimations of this model.  The following section will address \ntwo questions with respect to social capital: (1) what is it and (2) how does it affect the outcomes of the \nsmall-scale self-employed?  The way in which neighbourhood characteristics can influence the \naccumulation and returns to social capital will then be analysed. \nSocial Capital and Self-employment Success \n Social capital can be defined at several levels: country, community and the individual (Glaeser et \nal, 2000).  At the country level, social capital is viewed as the degree of trust in government or other \nsocietal institutions (Fukuyama, 1995).  This includes the willingness to participate in civil society, obey \nthe law and a general efficacy in the workings of civil administration.  At the community level, Jacobs \n 4\n(1961) posits that social capital exists as \u201cneighbourhood networks\u201d, or as Putnam (1995) suggests, it \nsignifies \u201cfeatures of social life \u2013 networks, norms, and trusts \u2013 that enable participants to act together \nmore effectively to pursue shared objectives.\u201d  That is, social capital could be thought of as the extent and \nquality of connections within communities.  Lastly, social capital can be attributed to the individual level.  \nAs Glaesar et al (2000) note, \u201c\u2026an individual\u2019s social capital is that individual\u2019s social characteristics \u2013 \nincluding charisma, status and access to networks \u2013 that enable that person to extract private returns from \ninteractions with others.\u201d  The central thrust of these definitions of social capital is that, apart from the \nsocial returns, there are private returns to its possession.  That is, higher levels of social capital should \nlead to better levels of economic performance for the individual.   \nSanders and Nee (1996) outline three mechanisms by which social relations (the most important \nfacet of social capital) positively affect self-employment success. Social relations can offer or provide (1) \ninstrumental support; (2) productive information; and (3) psychological aid. Instrumental support drawn \nfrom social relations can directly affect performance by providing, for example, such things as start up \ncapital and non-interest bearing loans to a credit-constrained entrepreneur. Instrumental support also \ninvolves the provision of \u201cfree\u201d labour, as in the case of a small business where family members or close \nfamily friends provide their services at below market clearing wages.  \nSocial relations can also disseminate productive information and therefore act as an indirect \nchannel in improving the earnings of the self-employed. Useful information includes the transfer of \nbusiness acumen from one person to another and the transfer of knowledge about local competitors and \ntrusted local suppliers. That is, a greater number of social ties within a neighbourhood increase a \nmicroentrepreneur\u2019s sensitivity to local supply and demand conditions, especially if that microenterprise \noperates out of the home \u2013 as is the case with a majority of small-scale operators.  Social relations can \nalso produce valuable customer referrals since advertising and \u201cgetting the word out\u201d about a particular \nproduct or service is difficult for many small-scale enterprises (Holzer, 1988).  \nFinally, social relations provide psychological aid and are sources of behavior emulation for a \nsmall-scale entrepreneur. Individuals lacking close personal connections are more prone to depression and \n 5\nsuffer longer and more numerous unemployment spells (Darity and Goldsmith, 1996). Maintaining social \nrelations can therefore prevent business dissolution caused by personal problems and can ensure that \neffort and motivation are not seriously impaired during times of emotional stress. In Maslow\u2019s hierarchy-\nof-needs framework, satisfying internal requirements for emotional attachment is a prerequisite needed to \nmake someone motivated enough to achieve business success.5  Whether it is through the channel of \ninstrumental, informative or psychological support, social capital can be thought of as an input in the \nproduction function of the small-scaled self-employed. \nNeighbourhood Effects and Self-Employment Success \n Neighbourhood effects are defined as any neighbourhood characteristic that can affect the returns \n(or the outcomes) of an individual\u2019s economic behaviour.  Neighbourhood characteristics are typically \ndefined at the city and\/or community level and are intended to capture the nature and quality of the \ncommunity in which an individual resides.6 Common measures include average income, education, ethnic \ncomposition and home ownership.  Neighbourhood characteristics can also be qualitative in nature, such \nas urban design and community spirit. \nThe physical and socioeconomic characteristics of a neighbourhood affect the returns to self-\nemployment either directly through their impact on local demand conditions, or indirectly through their \nrole in facilitating the accumulation of social capital. The physical characteristics of a neighbourhood \n(e.g. its urban design) can affect the performance of self-employed individuals in a number of ways. For \ninstance, the social capital required to succeed in a small business is more easily formed within more \nhighly populous, highly integrated and economically clustered urban areas. The reason may be as simple \nas the fact that the chance of interacting and meeting peers who share complimentary business products, \nservices, skills, or interests is greater in these areas. Greater proximity also promotes clusters of spin-off \nservice enterprises, offers valuable opportunities for interaction and acts as a catalyst to small-scale \ninnovation and the sharing of information.7  Likewise, neighbourhoods with higher population densities \nand greater levels of commercial concentration generate higher levels of demand for the services of the \nsmall-scaled self-employed (Ciccone and Hall, 1996). \n 6\nIn North America, neighbourhoods constructed before the 1960s contain a compact gathering of \nhouses, apartment buildings, corner groceries, main street shops and offices, all within walking distance \n(Jacobs, 1961). This type of urban design facilitates the individual or personal harnessing of social capital.  \nWhere population density is higher and urban design favours pedestrian traffic, information is more easily \nspread and transportation costs are lower, both of which make it easier for small-scale owners to inform \nand retain local customers.  \n Socioeconomic characteristics of a neighbourhood may exert positive spillover effects for self-\nemployed individuals. Home ownership encourages investment in local amenities and social capital by \ngiving individuals an incentive to improve their community and by reducing the likelihood of outward \nmobility (DiPasquale and Glaeser, 1999). To paraphrase Hirschman (1970), in the absence of an easy \n\u201cexit\u201d option, \u201cvoice\u201d becomes the predominant means of improving local conditions. Using a standard \nspillover argument, the greater the proportion of individuals within a neighbourhood who own homes the \nmore likely it is that self-employed individuals working and\/or living in that neighbourhood will be able \nto interact with and grow to know their neighbors. This, in turn, allows a micro-enterprise to expand and \nmaintain a trusted and loyal customer base. \nGeneral levels of human capital within a neighbourhood exert similar effects on the performance \nof the small-scale self-employed. Glaeser, Scheinkman, and Shleifer (1993) and Glaeser et al (1993) \nprovide models that confirm the importance of a generally well-educated labour force, as opposed to \nhighly skilled elite, in improving local economic performance. Though these models have been used to \naccount for differences in economic growth rates across cities, a similar mechanism can be applied to the \ncase of a small home-based entrepreneur. A community that shares a similar level of skill and education \nwould presumably transfer productive information across individuals more easily.  Likewise, higher \naverage levels of education are also related to higher levels of income, and hence better market demand \nconditions for the goods and services provided by the small-scaled self-employed.  For these and other \nreasons, neighbourhood characteristics (operating through urban design and socio-economic channels) \ncan significantly affect how well a self-employed business performs. \n 7\nIndividual Heterogeneity as a Cause of Self-Employment Success \n Obviously there are many other factors that affect self-employment earnings (e.g., individual \nwork ethic, intelligence, gender, and technology). The foregoing presentation has instead focused on \nsocial capital and neighbourhood characteristics, which are of particular relevance to small-scale \nentrepreneurs and microcredit institutions, but have been rarely discussed in formal econometric \nexpositions. Moreover, as is shown in the discussion of data below, the sample that will be used in this \nstudy accounts for much of the typical observed and unobserved heterogeneity that could affect self-\nemployment success.  \n 3.  Data and Sample Characteristics \nThis unique data set consists of borrowers who accessed loans from Calmeadow Metrofund -- \nCanada\u2019s largest non-profit microfinance organization -- between 1994 and 1998 and covers the entire \npopulation of clients as of July 1998.8 The sampling frame used in the survey included 612 group \nborrowers and 52 individual borrowers. Individual borrowers were those receiving credit without having \nto access social ties for collateral, whereas group borrowers were asked to form a peer group as a \ncondition of credit extension. Typically, peer group clients had smaller businesses and were more likely \nto be first time loan applicants. \nBecause of our exclusive access, the data were drawn from both confidential client file \napplication forms and a survey designed and administered by the authors.  Despite its limitations, there is \nno other data set of its kind available in North America with as rich a source of information about \nmicrocredit borrowers. \nAdvantages of the Data Set \nThe use of this data set confers several advantages. First, the data are drawn from a sample of \nself-employed individuals receiving microcredit in the form of peer group loans. Consequently, our \nmeasurement of self-employment earnings will be more accurate than those contained in standard surveys \nbecause the earnings measures reported by individuals on their loan application are subject to a strict \nscreening process and are verified by the loan manager and the fellow peer group members.9 The use of \n 8\nmicrofinance loan recipients also provides a useful forum for exploring the importance of social capital \nsince the group lending process places a large premium on social relations.   \nA second advantage conferred by this data set is that by personally designing and administering \nthe survey, we were able to employ a number of questions to measure both social capital and the \nimportance of neighbourhood effects. Because this data set can account for the multiple dimensions of \nsocial capital, it is a direct improvement over much of the literature that often uses singular measures to \ntest the link between social capital and some observable outcome.  Linking postal codes with each \nindividual borrower and then matching them to census data equally facilitated the estimation of \nneighbourhood effects.   \nFinally, apart from the standard demographic, household and business characteristics for each \nborrower, the data set also contains a section that includes information on conventionally unobserved \npersonal characteristics such as motivational predisposition and adherence to moral codes. This section \nwas added to the survey in order to account for unobserved heterogeneity that is typically controlled for in \npanel data sets by the use of first-difference techniques and\/or fixed-effects estimators. \nSample Issues \nThe original sampling frame consisted of 664 individuals. From this base, a telephone survey was \ndesigned by the authors in order to contact every borrower from this initial subset.  Unfortunately, 20 \npercent of the individuals no longer resided at the address and telephone numbers supplied in the \nsampling frame, and thus were not contacted by the surveyors.10 However, of those individuals that were \ncontacted, the survey response rate was very high (82 percent).  In our empirical estimations we excluded \nobservations with missing data on the dependent variable \u2013 average monthly net-business revenues \u2013 \nthereby reducing the eventual sample size to 430 observations.   \nCharacteristics of Calmeadow\u2019s Borrowers \nCalmeadow\u2019s clients are demographically representative of the population of Toronto.  \nApproximately 55% of all clients are female and over half are immigrants, 40% are Caucasian and most \nmajor ethnic groups are present (Table 1).  However, the sample is more heavily weighted in favour of \n 9\nAfrican Canadians while East and South Asian Canadians are underrepresented.11  The average borrower \nis single, 42 years old (normally distributed) and has more education than the general population (since \nover 60% have a community college diploma or better). \n The household characteristics reveal that the average Calmeadow client is poor (Table 2).  \nAverage monthly household income is $1600 (median $1300) and net assets are only $6800 (median \n$4500).12  Many borrowers (40%) rely on their self-employment activity as the \u201cmajor\u201d or \u201conly\u201d source \nof income.  The majority of clients, while obviously credit constrained, have other sources of credit \n(primarily in the form of credit cards).13  However, 40% rely solely on Calmeadow for their funds.   \n The average business operated by a Calmeadow client is very small with revenues of only $2680 \nper month (median $1500) and profits of $1250 per month (median $600) (Table 2).  The vast majority of \nclients run sole proprietorships located in their home.  Over 30% are startups (less than 1 year old) and \nexisting businesses have been operating for an average of two years.  The businesses cover a wide range \nof activity but most provide some form of personal, business or retail service.  A small but significant \nminority of businesses manufacture small items (artisanry or jewellery manufacturing for example) or \nown construction\/landscaping businesses.  Apart from this last category, most businesses are similar in \nsize and composition. \n The survey data reveal that roughly half of all the respondents belonged to a community club, \nassociation or organisation (Table 3).  Typically, Calmeadow clients were members of organisations such \nas ethnic community groups, churches, volunteer organisations and sports clubs.  They tended to know \ntheir neighbours and generally found their business connections to be helpful.   \n4.  Measuring the Returns to Social Capital and Neighbourhood Characteristics \nNa\u00efve Empirical Specification \nA standard human capital regression model augmented with social capital and neighbourhood \neffects was initially specified:  \n  Model 1:       yi = \u03b1 + \u03b21Hi + \u03b22Si + \u03b23Ni + \u03b24Xi +  \u03b5i          (2) \n 10\nwhere yi is log monthly net average earnings,  H is a set of human capital variables, S social capital \nvariables, N neighbourhood characteristics and X other personal and business characteristics.  The \nsubscript i denotes the self-employed individual. \nThree measures of human capital S were employed: categorical educational attainment variables; \na dummy variable coded 1 if individuals had taken a technical course related to their business, 0 \notherwise; and a dummy variable coded 1 if the individual had knowledge of computers, 0 otherwise. The \nvector N included three principal indicators of neighbourhood quality14: the proportion of \nresidential\/commercial construction built before 1960; the proportion of individuals with less than 13-15 \nyears of education; and the proportion of home ownership. A lengthy list of personal and business \ncharacteristics X were also added as controls and are clearly labeled in the regression tables.  \nMeasures of Social Capital  \nTo account for social capital\u2019s multiple dimensions, three measures of social capital were \nemployed.15 First, membership in a community organization that met regularly was used as a proxy for \nthe instrumental and informative benefits arising from a greater quantity of social ties. More generally, \nthis measure was intended to capture the returns gained from participation in civil society. Second, asking \nsurvey participants to rate their social contacts in terms of how helpful they were to business success \nassessed the quality of such social connections.  Lastly, how well an individual knew their neighbor was \nmeasured through a survey question and multiplied with a home-based business dummy in order to create \nan interaction term. The knowledge-of-neighbour variable and its interaction term were employed in order \nto control for the effect of weak and strong social ties on self-employment earnings.16 The concept of \nweak-ties has been used extensively amongst economic sociologists to describe relationships among \npeople who do not necessarily maintain regular communication or who do not live in close proximity \nwith each other, but who nevertheless derive benefits from the maintenance of such social relations. \nStrong-ties, on the other hand, are those forged largely among family and close-knit friends (Granovetter, \n1973). Weak ties are potentially very important for low-income entrepreneurs living and\/or operating \n 11\ntheir businesses within a neighbourhood because they can provide access to valuable outside resources \nand information about external customers and suppliers.  \nProblems in Estimating the Returns to Social Capital and Neighbourhood Characteristics \nThere are three main issues that complicate the estimation of the returns to social capital and \nneighbourhood characteristics captured in Model 1: (i) identification, (ii) endogeneity and (iii) \nunobserved heterogeneity all confound our na\u00efve empirical specification. Identification error is a potential \nproblem given the multifaceted nature of our three neighbourhood quality variables.  In particular, our \nhypothesis that general education levels within a neighbourhood influence individual earnings may \nsimply be picking up local demand conditions rather than the influence of social interactions with \neducated people.   \nA second problem is endogeneity since greater earnings could be linked to being an active \nmember of a social organization.  Hence, the causality could run both ways.  One mechanism may be that \nclub membership leads to higher earnings (due to more business contacts), which simultaneously leads to \na greater propensity to join and become a more active member.  If this is the case, then the coefficient on \nclub membership will be biased upwards.  Another mechanism may be that struggling entrepreneurs \nspend more time trying to keep their microbusinesses solvent and therefore have a lower probability of \nactively participating in social organizations.17  \nFinally, any positive social capital effects may be due to unobserved heterogeneity.  Individuals \nwho already have extensive social connections are also those who are more likely to join a club and may \nalso possess some unobservable characteristic (such as entrepreneurial ability or being a \u201cgo-getter\u201d) that \nleads to higher returns in their self-employment activity. Unless one can find enough information on a \nclient\u2019s background and attitudinal disposition, or suitable instruments for predicting club membership, \nthen the interpretation on this coefficient should be considered carefully since it will be positively \nbiased.18  Each of the three problems highlighted above is examined in turn with suggested \nmodeling strategies and empirical specifications included. \n \n 12\nProblem 1: Disaggregating the \u2018Social\u2019  and \u2018Demand\u2019 Effects of Neighbourhood Quality \n Even if a significant correlation between neighbourhood quality and self-employment earnings \nwere to emerge from equation (2), it would be difficult to specify the mechanism at work. The question of \nwhether neighbourhood quality measures are capturing the ability of the small-scale self-employed to \nmore easily accumulate social capital, or whether they are simply measuring a demand effect, would still \nremain. Consequently, controlling for both average neighbourhood income levels and changes in average \nincome would help identify which neighbourhood mechanism is at work. If general levels of education, \nhome ownership and traditional urban design operate through social channels, then these neighbourhood \neffects should persist even after controlling for local demand conditions. The na\u00efve empirical \nspecification should therefore be augmented in order to incorporate the following two neighbourhood \ndemand effects: \n  Model 2:       yi = \u03b1 + \u03b21Hi + \u03b22 Si + \u03b23 Ni + \u03b24 Xi + \u03b25 Li+ \u03b26 \u2206Li+  \u03b5i         (3) \nwhere L is the average neighbourhood income level in 1996 and where \u2206L = L1996 - L1991 is the change in \naverage neighbourhood income between 1991 and 1996 (these years represent the latest available \nCanadian Census data).  \nProblem 2:The Simultaneity and Endogeneity of Club Membership and Earnings \nIf active participation in civil society is endogenous, then any estimate of organizational \nmembership will be biased upwards. That is, if membership requires some upfront cost then this would \nleave only the \u201calready successful\u201d in our membership category. However, an examination of the types of \nclubs that were reported in the survey suggests that endogeneity based on budget constraints is not \nproblematic.  For example, frequently listed associations were churches, sports clubs or teams, women\u2019s \ngroups, cultural and ethnic associations, hospice societies, senior\u2019s groups and various small business \nassociations. Typically, these types of clubs\/groups\/associations do not require any substantive monetary \ncontribution to participate. Indeed, individuals belonged to groups whose activities required time and \nsocial commitment, but no substantial membership dues.  \n 13\nHowever, even if financial resources are not a binding constraint on membership, the time needed \nto join a group often is. It may be that struggling microborrowers spend more time on rescuing their \nfailing businesses, than they do participating actively in civil society.  Consequently, one would need to \ncontrol for \u201ctime-spent\u201d at the self-employment activity.19  Since we lack such a specific variable, we \nemploy as a proxy, a dummy variable coded 1 if the respondent\u2019s self-employment earnings only \n\u201csupplement\u201d household income, 0 otherwise.  This is done under the assumption that individuals who \nsupplement their income from self-employment are typically employed full or part time or have minor \ndependents. \nLastly, there may be a tendency for membership to be based on more than just sufficient time or \nmoney.  Belonging to a club or organization may be linked to some measure of social status, and one \nclear measure of social status is business success. In this instance, even if membership involves a \nnegligible monetary cost and few time constraints, the possibility exists that only the most successful \nindividuals tend to be active members of civil society. \nThe simultaneity problem based on unobservable social costs or predilections to join an \norganization can be solved by the use of instrumental variables, provided of course that valid instruments \nexist. Proper instruments in this case need to be significant predictors of group membership but unrelated \nto earnings.  As instruments in our first stage IV estimate, we use three attitudinal variables that are \nunobservable to lenders but that indicate some latent tendency to participate in civil society.  These latent \nvariables are (i) did the microborrower value membership in a club or organization highly, (ii) did he\/she \nvalue living in a neighbourhood where one knows neighbours very well, and (iii) did he\/she denote a \nwillingness to be patient when working with others. \nModel 3:       yi = \u03b1 + \u03b21Hi + \u03b2IV Si + \u03b23 Ni + \u03b24 Xi +  \u03b5i          (4) \nWhile complete checks of our IV estimates are found in table 5, an illustrative example demonstrates that \nattitudinal predispositions to club membership are weak predictors of earnings performance for \nmicroborrowers, as compared to actual group membership. Row 1 in Table 4 indicates that mean and \nmedian earnings are not significantly different among group members irrespective of how they felt about \n 14\ngroup membership. What is striking, however, are the differences one notices looking at columns (1) and \n(2.) Mean and median earnings increase markedly based on club membership irrespective of the hard-to-\nobserve attitudinal predisposition to join.  That is, club membership is a better correlate of earnings than \nsome underlying predilection towards group membership. Naturally, these results only suggest that \norganizational membership has a positive effect independent of a certain measure of unobserved \nheterogeneity. They do not tell us whether other motivational predispositions are at work, which is why \nthe IV estimates were conducted using three instruments and not one. \nProblem 3: Controlling For Unobserved Heterogeneity Amongst Borrowers  \nAny interpretation of the coefficient for actively participating in civil society S obtained from \nequation (2) is also dependent on the nature of the residual \u03b5i. If observable measures of human capital \nand ability do not fully capture some latent tendency to be active in all endeavors (both social and \nbusiness related) then even after controlling for a host of other factors, earnings differentials may still \nreflect unobserved work ethic and entrepreneurial ability. The error term in any estimation of (2) would \ntherefore be composed of two components: \n\u03b5i = \u03bb i +\u00b5 i       (5) \nwhere \u03bb is fixed or inherent entrepreneurial ability and where \u00b5 is the random component which is \northogonal to group membership. With panel data one could employ fixed-effect and first difference \nestimators to control for the unobserved ability. In the absence of such data, we instead exploit the rich \nassortment of background information on clients collected by our borrower survey. These variables can \nbe added to equation (2) in an effort to control for unobserved characteristics. We have identified four \ntime invariant components of unobserved heterogeneity \u03bb: (i) a vector of attitudes towards social \ncohesion; (ii) a vector of preferences and motivation for self-employment work; (iii) a vector of perceived \nbenefits of social ties (both weak and strong); and (iv) a vector of work-ethic variables based on social \nattitudes to group work and attitudes towards individual risk taking.20 By identifying these hard-to-\nobserve variables one can compare equation (2) with our pseudo fixed effect estimation below: \nModel 4:     yi = \u03b1 + \u03b21Hi + \u03b22 Si + \u03b23 Ni + \u03b24 Xi + \u03b25 \u03bb i +\u00b5 i                              (6) \n 15\nwhere \u03bb is our four-component vector of fixed effects. The expectation is that after controlling for \npreviously unobservable characteristics the coefficient on our principal social capital variable (club \nmembership) should fall and perhaps drop in significance when compared to Model 2. If the effect of \nparticipating in civil society is significant then the positive association between membership and earnings \nshould persist. \n5.  Results \nOLS estimates of equation (2) are presented in Table 5 where the dependent variable is log \nmonthly net earnings (revenues minus costs).  Column 1 (Model 1a) presents OLS estimates for a simple \nhuman capital specification of equation (2) without social capital and neighbourhood effects. Middle \naged, married, male and Canadian-born individuals earn more from their self-employment activities.21 \nSurprisingly, higher levels of education are not correlated with higher earnings, a finding that contradicts \nthe standard results found in most human capital studies.  However, the positive result often associated \nwith human capital generally applies to the formal labour market, where issues of credentialing and \nsignaling may matter more.  In the environment of small scale self-employment, it is very likely that the \nskills associated with running a small business are quite different from the more formal skills attained \nfrom schooling. This would also explain why technical training is not significantly related to higher self-\nemployment earnings.  However, individuals with a greater knowledge of computers earned more.  This \nvariable may be a proxy for other traits such as adaptability or the capacity to learn new skills, which are \ncorrelated with business success.   \nHome based businesses, which are typically smaller, earned less, while being a startup did not \naffect earnings.  Likewise, having paid workers was positively correlated with higher earnings but was \nnot significant (results not shown).  The type of business (e.g., its industrial classification) was also \nentered as a control to account for industry heterogeneity, but the effects were not significant (results not \nshown).  The effect of being in a peer group was negative and significant.  This result can be attributed to \nthe simple fact that self-employed individuals who received an individual loan tended to run larger \noperations, as required by the application process.  Consequently, one should not draw any firm \n 16\nconclusions regarding the effect of being in a peer group, in terms of its instrumental, informational or \npsychological effects, since the peer group dummy variable is actually picking up the simple fact that peer \ngroup borrowers run considerably smaller businesses.  Lastly, self-employed individuals who had outside \nsources of income earned less than individuals who relied more heavily on their self-employment \nearnings. \nDoes Social Capital Affect Self-Employment Earnings? \n Table 5, column (2) presents OLS estimates for Model 1b. Being a member of a club, team, \nassociation or organization that meets fairly regularly was significantly and positively associated with \nbusiness success. On average, members earned more than non-members.  Individuals who stated that \nconnections or contacts were useful earned more than those who believed that contacts or connections \nwere not useful. While both coefficients may be positively biased, the second measure of social capital is \nparticularly problematic.  It may simply be the case that those individuals who do better report their \nbusiness connections as being useful, and hence the result is biased owing to simultaneity.  Lastly, \nknowing neighbors well was associated with lower monthly net-earnings, albeit the effect was \ninsignificant. However, for home-based businesses, the interaction with knowledge of neighbors was \npositively related to earnings (again insignificant). This suggests that weak, rather than strong locally \nrooted ties, are more important for non-home based businesses.  The net effect of knowing your neighbors \nwell was marginally positive for homeowners. \nDo Neighbourhood Characteristics Affect Self-Employment Earnings? \nIndividuals, who reside and\/or work in neighbourhoods where there is a greater proportion of \npeople with education levels beyond a high school diploma, earned significantly more than otherwise \nsimilar individuals.  Traditional urban neighbourhoods (those built before 1960) also had positive effects \non net-earnings, as did the greater proportion of residents owning homes or apartments.22  \nWhile it is clear that there is a correlation between neighbourhood effects and self-employment \nearnings, it is difficult to identify which mechanism is at work.  Are neighbourhood measures such as \neducation and traditional urban environment picking up the ability to more easily accumulate social \n 17\ncapital? Or, are they simply measuring a demand effect?  To this end, column (3) presents the estimation \nresults for Model 2.  The inclusion of log average neighbourhood income and its change does not remove \nthe significance of the education variable.  However, it is clear from the results that neighbourhood \neducation and income are highly collinear, and consequently, the neighbourhood effects should still be \ninterpreted with care. \nIs the Club Membership Coefficient Biased? \nAs discussed, attributing cause and effect of our social capital measures on earnings is difficult \ngiven problems of endogeneity and unobserved individual level heterogeneity.  Each is addressed in turn.  \nFirst, the results of estimating Model 3 with instrumental variables are presented in Table 5, column 4. \nThree measures of attitudes towards social connections are used as instruments for club membership in \nthe first stage regression (results not shown). The validity of the instruments is partially confirmed by the \nover identification test statistic: one cannot reject the null hypothesis that the instruments are uncorrelated \nwith the error term. (Davidson and Mackinnon, 1993).  The coefficient for club membership is now larger \nthan its OLS counterpart but insignificant.  The increase in the magnitude of the club membership \ncoefficient suggests that club membership is exogenous since one would expect the coefficient to fall if \nsimultaneity were present (Narayan and Pritchett, 1997).  However, the results suggest that the \ninstruments are weak, at best, given the considerable increase in the magnitude of the standard error for \nclub membership coefficient.  The issue of unobserved heterogeneity is addressed by estimating Model 4 \n(our pseudo-fixed effects regression) and the results are presented in Table 6 (see Table 7 for the list of \nattitudinal measures).  In each case, inclusion of a lengthy set of hard-to-observe attitudinal dummy \nvariables did not dramatically alter the magnitude nor the significance of the social capital variables. \n 6. Conclusion \nThe present study has made a dual contribution to our understanding of microfinance borrowing \nwithin highly industrialized settings. First, it explored and described the outcomes of small-scaled self-\nemployed individuals who accessed loans from Canada\u2019s largest non-profit lending organization, \nsomething which heretofore we knew very little about. Second, by estimating an earnings function for a \n 18\nsample of self-employed microfinance borrowers, the paper answered one of the three critical questions \nfacing the microfinance literature: namely, what accounts for microborrower success? As demonstrated in \nthe empirical analysis, it appears that otherwise similar individuals (e.g., individuals with the same \nobservable levels of education) do not profit equally from the provision of microcredit. Social capital and \nother factors that are less observable to lenders \u2013 community wide levels of general education and \nknowledge of computing \u2013 all contribute to self-employment success.  \nModeling and estimating the factors that contribute to the viability and economic success of these \nsmall-scale entrepreneurs is one way for microfinance institutions to design efficient credit screening \npolicies. The present study has shown that individuals with little or no financial collateral may benefit \nfrom increased levels of social capital. There are also strong theoretical reasons and some empirical \nconfirmation that demonstrates that only certain urban environments are amenable to small-scale self-\nemployment success and that neighbourhood characteristics influence individual labour market \nperformance.  \nThe importance of these findings is also heightened by the fact that small-scale self-employment \nhas accounted for a large portion of private sector employment growth throughout the 1990s. Whether \nthis turns out to be a permanent feature of the labour market is still subject to debate (Roy, 1997). \nHowever, the fact that microfinance institutions like Calmeadow-Metrofund - which have been common \nin low-income economies for several decades - are now operating within urban centres lends indirect \nsupport to the notion put forth by several writers who link the rise in small-scale self-employment to the \nemergence of a new tertiary economy and a fundamental change in the overall occupational structure in \nwhich the self-employed workforce takes on greater importance as compared to wage earners. \n 19\nReferences \n \nBenabou, R.

The term small-\nscale self-employed is used synonymously in the text with other terms such as micro-entrepreneur, micro-enterprise \nand the low income self-employed. \n3 Pitt and Kandker (1998) and Signe-Mary McKernan (forthcoming) have examined the \u2018credit\u2019 and \u2018non-credit\u2019 \neffects of microlending on borrower profitability.  \n4 See Evans and Leighton  (1989) for a standard treatment. \n5 Darity and Goldsmith (1996) summarize the empirical and theoretical evidence demonstrating the positive \nrelationship between psychological well-being and individual productivity. \n6 The relevant geographic scope of a \u201cneighbourhood\u201d is the area within which a neighbourhood characteristic effect \noperates, and thus depends on the externality under consideration.   \n7 Indeed, the literature on neighbourhood effects emphasizes the positive (and sometimes negative) spillovers that \ncan prevail as individuals cluster, both voluntarily and involuntarily, into particular neighbourhoods (Borjas, 1992). \n8 Calmeadow Metrofund serves the Metropolitan Toronto region, and lends money to self-employed individuals who \nhave been traditionally neglected by banks and other mainstream financial institutions For example, 30 percent of \nCalmeadow\u2019s client base (see table 2) is composed of start-up businesses (defined as businesses with less than one \nyear of operation). This is a group that traditionally would not be served by most banking institutions given \n\u201cstandard documentation requirements\u201d which imply the need to supply 1-3 years of personal and business financial \nstatements. \n9 For instance, borrowers often provide their receipts for revenues and expenses.  Since most of the borrowers \noperate in the informal sector and are unregistered, there is less of a tendency to underestimate earnings, as \ncompared to survey data that utilizes income tax filing data to measure self-employment earnings.  Likewise, fellow \ngroup members also scrutinize a borrower\u2019s application \u2013 if the application form data are not satisfactory, the group \ncan veto that particular borrower\u2019s application. \n10 The survey may have systematically missed those who had moved. It may be that \u201cmovers\u201d are associated with a \nkey independent variable such as lack of social ties and the sample would have misrepresented the \u201ctrue\u201d \ndistribution of factors like social capital and biased upward the social capital co-efficient. However, a lack of social \nties may also prevent mobility. This could be the case if the social ties are weak and located outside the community. \nIf this is so, then alternative places to work and live are not available to those lacking social ties. Hence movers may \nhave more, rather than fewer, social ties and thus our co-efficient on social capital would be biased downwards. \nGiven this ambiguity, the bias on the social capital co-efficient is indeterminate. \n11 This may represent the fact that South and East Asians (in particular) have well-developed informal credit markets \nwithin their ethnic community and thus Calmeadow is not a source of credit. \n12 This figure is most likely biased upwards significantly. Anecdotal evidence suggests that, while liabilities are well \nreported (due to their verification), assets are overestimated systematically. \n13 Borrowers who posses credit cards are often \u201cmaxed out\u201d, that is, at their credit limit. \n14 Neighbourhoods are defined, for the purposes of this study, as Canadian federal electoral districts.  In results not \npresented here, we originally included unrestricted neighbourhood fixed-effect dummies. These results were \ninsignificant and were dropped from our reduced-form specification. \n15 Using multiple measures of social capital also reduces the problem of measurement error for our key independent \nvariables. For instance, membership in a group or organization can be quantified by adding up the total number of \nclub memberships.  This is an imperfect proxy, however, as it is very difficult to know if individuals make a \nquantity-quality tradeoff with respect to social ties.  Consequently, virtually any single quantification of social \ncapital is a potential oversimplification of an otherwise complicated measure.  \n16 More specifically, the idea behind the knowledge of neighbor variable is that individuals with strong ties inside \ntheir own locality are more isolated from weak tie relationships that are needed for business success. The \ncontingency argument is that those businesses rooted in their local community and operating out of the home (the \ninteraction term) should benefit from closer ties with neighbors. The coefficient for knowing neighbors well should \nbe negative for the entire sample, but positive when interacted for those who are home based. \n17 We thank an anonymous referee for this suggestion. \n18 Self-selection may also be an issue.  The borrowers contained in the Calmeadow data set represent a select group \nof micro-entrepreneurs, since these individuals, while credit-constrained, were nonetheless able to meet the \nborrowing requirements of the Calmeadow program.  In this way, the borrowers in the data set are qualitatively \ndifferent than the borrowers who were declined loans (or those who did not bother to apply at all).  The relevant \n 29\n                                                                                                                                                             \nquestion is whether this source of self-selection is correlated with the set of observables on the right-hand side, in \nparticular, the measures of social capital that are of interest.  One could argue that only those individuals with high \nlevels of social capital could access loans and thus self-selection would bias any social capital coefficient upwards.  \nFortunately, Calmeadow does maintain records on those clients who are declined and there does not appear to be \nany obvious difference (in terms of the observables in the regression) between accepted and declined borrowers, \nsince the basis for rejection is typically poor credit history (recent bankruptcy) or lack of an adequate business plan. \n19 Once again we thank an anonymous reviewer for this suggestion. \n20 A list of all the variables used in our pseudo fixed effect estimations can be found in Table 7. \n21 The negative coefficient for those over 60 years old may reflect life cycle behaviour. \n22 Although the signs of the coefficients all confirmed the theoretical expectations, only one of the three \nneighbourhood characteristics is significantly related to net earnings. The basic problem resides in the lack of \nvariation in the data. The sample is too small to detect the spillover effects arising from average neighbourhood \ncharacteristics. In the above regressions there are 5 to 15 individual observations on earnings for each observation \non neighbourhood characteristics. It may be that these variables are in fact capturing unobserved qualities of self-\nemployed individuals who reside in a given neighbourhood. \n 30\n"}
