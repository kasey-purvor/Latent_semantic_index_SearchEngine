We have therefore, where possible, used these sub-categories, rather than broad meta-categories such as 'South Asian'.  In some cases this level of analysis was not possible because of limited sample size (e.g. malignancy rates).  In general, we have taken a pragmatic approach to defining ethnicity and we have used the most appropriate indicators available in a particular situation.  The response of individuals to the screening invitation (uptake rate) had to be estimated by analysis of routine data without the benefit of ethnic monitoring data being available.  We therefore used a name recognition software package (Nam Pehchan 3) to identify the religious and linguistic background of invitees.  The Nam Pehchan computer programme was developed by Bradford City Council and Health Authority in the 1980\u2019s.  It contains a dictionary of South Asian names that are matched against the complete name or the name stem (usually the first five characters of an individual's name) in order to provide a list of South Asians together with a language and religion marker for each person.  Five distinct religion-language groups are currently 4 identified: Hindu-Gujerati, Hindu-Other, Muslim, Sikh and Other Asian.  Table 1.3.2 shows that, besides the difference in their language and religion, other important features distinguish these groups from one another such as the nature of their diet (vegetarian, non-vegetarian, consumption of red meat etc.) and their literacy levels.  The rest of the population is categorised as \u2018non-Asian\u2019 by the software since name recognition software cannot be used to distinguish ethnic groups whose members do not have distinctive names e.g. African Caribbeans.  However, since the South Asian population is much larger than the African-Caribbean population in the English Pilot site, this was viewed as an acceptable strategy.  Focus groups were held with a broad range of ethnic groups, including African Caribbeans, in order to counterbalance any shortcomings due to the constraints imposed on the analysis of routine data and the conduct of the psychosocial survey.  Usually, the level of refinement discussed above is not apparent in the literature we have reviewed.","cites":null},{"id":440954,"title":"0.187, ns Hindu-Gujerati Hindu-Other Muslim Sikh-Punjabi","authors":[],"date":null,"doi":null,"raw":"Survey Participants  Survey NonParticipants Chi-square  N = 783 N = 3094  N %      N % \u03c7\u00b2, p Phase I Non-Responder Phase I Negative 155 628 19.8 80.2 2434 660 78.7 21.3 976.244, p < .000 Men Women 396 387 50.6 49.4 1538 1556 49.7 50.3 0.187, ns Hindu-Gujerati Hindu-Other Muslim Sikh-Punjabi 194 87 191 311 24.8 11.1 24.4 39.7 530 158 852 1554 17.1 5.1 27.5 50.2 71.852, p < .000 Age 50-54 Age 55-59 Age 60-64 Age 65-69 250 177 204 152 31.9 22.6 26.1 19.4 1077 737 674 606 34.8 23.8 21.8 19.6 6.946, ns Depcat \u00bd Depcat 3 Depcat 4 Depcat 5 Depcat 6\/7 97 89 198 123 263 12.6 11.6 25.7 16.0 34.2 244 204 561 552 1495 8.0 6.7 18.4 18.1 48.9 81.314, p < .000 Depcat1\/2\/3 Depcat 4\/5\/6\/7 186 584 24.2 75.8 448 2608 14.7 85.3 40.117, p < .000  55   Ethnicity: UK Colorectal Cancer Screening Pilot 3.3  Focus Group Studies  3.3.1 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES The aims of the focus group discussions were to supplement the quantitative data obtained through routine monitoring and the questionnaire survey, and to obtain some insight into the possibly differing rationalisations of behaviour and motivation among members of minority ethnic groups whose cultural background was likely to differ from the majority white population.

Those sampled are sent a) a questionnaire booklet and letter b) a reminder letter two weeks later c) a second booklet and reminder letter three weeks later.  Participants to the survey were offered the opportunity to be entered into a prize lottery draw for a \u00a350 voucher.  The letter accompanying the questionnaire booklet contained a passage translated into 5 languages inviting people to seek the assistance of an English speaker if they required this in order to complete the booklet.  3.2.2.3 Questionnaire The questionnaire booklet was a shortened version of that utilised for the main study. The questionnaire was scrutinised by specialist members of the ethnicity evaluation team and discussed with community centre attendees. Some changes to specific wordings were made following this pilot..  3.2.2.4 Participation. Completed questionnaires were obtained from a total sample of N = 783. (87 Hindu-other, 194 Hindu-Gujerati, 191 Muslim and 311 Sikh-Punjabi).  The questionnaire participation rate varied considerably across responder groups. After adjusting the denominator for numbers of people who were unavailable or refused to participate and returned a blank questionnaire, participation rates were (a) Phase 1 non-responders 6% (b) Phase 1 negatives 48.8%. Participation also varied by ethnicity. Hindus were more likely to participate (Hindu-other = 35.5%, HinduGujerati = 26.8%) than either Muslims (18.3%) or Sikhs (16.7%) (see Tables 3.2.1 and 3.2.2).  Comparison of questionnaire participants and non-participants showed that non-participants had higher deprivation category scores (see Table 3.2.3).  There were no associations with age or gender.  49   Ethnicity: UK Colorectal Cancer Screening Pilot  3.2.3 RESULTS; UPTAKE OF FOBT: COMPARISON OF NON-RESPONDERS AND RESPONDERS.  3.2.3.1  Behavioural risk and uptake (see Appendix A6, Tables A6.1 and A6.2) Approximately forty per cent of all survey participants reported never or rarely engaging in physical activity and about 10% were current smokers.  Sikh- Punjabis were less likely to smoke than other groups (3.3%).  Between 44 % and 55% of all participants were obese\/overweight according to the BMI and between forty and fifty per cent of Hindus and Muslims reported a low fibre intake.  Sikh-Punjabis were less likely to report a low fibre intake (33%).  Hindu-Gujeratis, Muslims and Sikh-Punjabis were also less likely to report a blood relative with bowel cancer than White-Europeans.  All risk indicators were lower for Asians than has been found amongst the main sample of White-Europeans.  FOBt non-responders were less likely to engage in regular exercise and were less likely to report knowing someone with bowel cancer or a family history of bowel cancer.  3.2.3.2  Perceived susceptibility to bowel cancer (see Appendix A6, Tables A6.3 and A6.4) Approximately forty percent considered themselves to be at personal risk of developing bowel cancer. Levels of age specific optimism were quite high; just 47% of Hindu-others and 44% of Hindu-Gujeratis % perceived themselves at higher risk of bowel cancer than other people of their own age compared with 59% of Muslims. Perceived susceptibility was not associated with uptake of the test.  3.2.3.3  Perceived severity of bowel cancer (see Appendix A6, Tables A6.5 and A6.6) We assessed both perceived physical severity and perceived psychosocial severity. Approximately two thirds of the sample considered bowel cancer painful and likely to cause physical sickness. Perceived severity was not associated with uptake of FOBt, although a significant association with uptake has been obtained for the WhiteEuropean sample.  3.2.3.4  Perceived efficacy of FOBt in reducing cancer risk (see Appendix A6, Table A6.7 and A6.8) Public confidence in the effectiveness of FOBt was very high across all groups. FOBt was viewed by over ninety percent of participants as likely to lead to earlier treatment, and by over eighty percent of participants as likely to detect abnormalities, prevent drastic treatment and reduce worry about bowel cancer. However, we did obtain significant differences between non-responders and responders. Non-responders were less likely to believe that taking part in FOBt would give them peace of mind and less likely to believe that FOBt would prevent the need for drastic treatment.  3.2.3.5  Perceived self-efficacy and barriers to completing FOBt (see Appendix A6, Tables A6.9, A6.10, A6.11 and A6.12) Self-efficacy was an important determinant of FOBt uptake. Nearly 90% of responders perceived the FOBt kit as easy to complete and were confident in their ability to do so. However, non-responders were significantly less confident, with only 60% reporting that it would be easy for them to do the kit. Muslims were least confident of their ability to complete the kit. Table A6.11 shows specific difficulties in completing the kit. Difficulties related to constipation, irregular bowel movements, illness and lack of time distinguished non-responders from responders. No specific barrier explained the lower self-efficacy of Muslims.  3.2.3.6  Perceived psychological costs of completing FOBt (see Appendix A6, Tables A6.13 and A6.14) Psychological barriers to completing an FOBt were important discriminators of non-respondents. Nonresponders to FOBt were more likely to view completing the kit as an invasion of privacy (54%), embarrassing (67%), disgusting (58%) or unhygienic (56%). Hindu-Gujeratis also perceived the test as more disgusting and more unhygienic than all other groups.  3.2.3.7  Perceived social encouragement for performing an FOBt (Tables A6.15 and A6.16) People often take the opinions of others into account when deciding whether to perform a behaviour. We included all the sources of social influence previously investigated amongst White-Europeans but also included \u2018community leaders\u2019 in the ethnicity survey. FOBt non-responders were less likely than responders to perceive encouragement from their partners or children. Perceived support from community leaders was low for both groups (64% and 69%). Hindu-Gujeratis reported the lowest levels of support and Sikhs the highest levels of social support for completing an FOBt.  50   Ethnicity: UK Colorectal Cancer Screening Pilot  3.2.3.8  Comparison of Asians and White-Europeans (see Appendix A6, Tables A6.17, A6.18, A6.19, A6.20, A6.21, A6.22 and A6.23) Asians as a whole were less likely to take up FOBt than White-Europeans (section 3.1.3) so we examined absolute differences between the two populations. White-Europeans were more likely to be smokers, obese, have a higher fat intake and a lower fibre intake than Asians. They were also more likely to know someone with bowel cancer and have a family history of the disease. Interestingly these findings were paralleled by a lower perceived susceptibility amongst Asians. Asians and White-Europeans did not view bowel cancer differently, except in terms of pain. Whilst perceived severity was associated with uptake amongst White-Europeans, it was not associated with uptake amongst Asians.  Perceived efficacy of screening, self-efficacy and barriers, costs and social influence were significant discriminators of screening for both Asian and White-European samples. Asians also perceived screening as less efficacious, were less confident of their ability to complete the FOBt kit and perceived more barriers to screening. Asians also found the test more unpleasant to complete and some groups reported high levels of disgust and concerns about hygiene. Perceived social support was also lower amongst Asians. Support from community leaders was perceived as low, whereas support from GPs was perceived as high.  3.2.3.9  Future intentions and thoughts about roll-out (see Appendix A6, Tables A6.24 and A6.25) Over 70% of FOBt non-responders and over 90% of responders stated an intention to complete an FOBt if they were offered one in the future.  Asians were slightly less likely to agree that screening should be rolled out, particularly Muslims and Hindu-Gujeratis.  3.2.4  RESULTS:  PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AFTER FOBT  (SEE  APPENDIX  A6, TABLE A6.26) Psychological distress was assessed using standard validated measures of anxiety, depression and anger, which have been used in previous studies of colorectal cancer, breast and cervical cancer screening impact.  It should be noted that these measures have not been validated on minority ethnic groups, for whom specific norms are not available.  Levels of anxiety and depression for all Asian survey participants were higher than available population norms and higher than White-Europeans.  Sikh-Punjabis reported the highest levels of depression and anger.  Non-responders to FOBt reported more symptoms of anxiety and depression than those who did complete the kit.  3.2.5  DISCUSSION Although FOBt uptake was reasonable overall, there is clearly room for improvement.  Moreover, uptake was substantially lower amongst Asians than amongst White-Europeans.  The psychosocial survey may provide information which could assist in addressing inequality in uptake, and promote uptake generally.  The protocol followed standard practice to maximise survey returns; the instrument was scrutinised by ethnic minority members, a foreign language letter was included in the packages and 2 reminders and a lottery prize inducement were utilised. Nonetheless, the response rate to the questionnaire was less than optimal, and considerably lower than that obtained amongst the white-European sample. The lowest response rates were obtained amongst those groups with the lowest known levels of literacy. Notwithstanding this limitation, data were obtained from over 700 members of ethnic minorities, and provide data suitable for drawing comparisons with white-European respondents. It would have been inappropriate to utilise an instrument or approach that did not permit such direct comparison.  Information about behavioural risk factors indicated that Asians were at lower risk than White-Europeans and this was reflected in lower perceived susceptibility.  It should also be noted that Asians may be less aware of bowel cancer, being less likely to report either knowing someone with the disease or having a blood relative with the disease.  Notably, however, neither perceived susceptibility nor perceived severity of bowel cancer was associated with FOBt uptake amongst Asians.  This is in contrast to the finding that White-European nonresponders perceived bowel cancer as more severe than responders.  51   Ethnicity: UK Colorectal Cancer Screening Pilot  Public confidence in bowel cancer screening effectiveness was very high.  However, doubts about its effectiveness in preventing death from bowel cancer and in providing peace of mind about bowel cancer did explain a proportion of variance in non-response.  Moreover, Asians were less confident of the effectiveness of screening than White-Europeans.  Maintaining confidence in screening will be an important consideration for a mass-screening programme.  The most important factors affecting FOBt response amongst both Asians and White-Europeans are those relating to the ease or difficulty of completing the kit.  Muslims reported particularly low self-efficacy with regard to completing the kit.  Constipation, irregular bowel movements and lack of time distinguished Asian non-responders from responders.  Non-response was also associated with finding the process of completing the kit disgusting or embarrassing or having concerns about hygiene.  Asians were almost twice as likely to report these concerns compared with White-Europeans.  These emotional reactions may be linked to complaints of constipation or diarrhoea.  It may be possible to address these barriers in communications sent to people with their kits.  We obtained no evidence of psychological distress following FOBt. Non-responders were more distressed than responders generally.  However, Asians as a whole and Sikh-Punjabis in particular were significantly more distressed than White-Europeans irrespective of their responder status.   52   Ethnicity: UK Colorectal Cancer Screening Pilot    Table 3.2.1.

This is a very early (1991) study comparing three interventions designed to increase uptake among South Asian women in Leicester, and a rare study in that it considers Asian sub-groups rather than just the meta-category 'South Asian' (396a).  737 randomly selected Asian women (aged 18-52) who were recorded as never having had a cervical smear test were randomised to four groups; a home visit by research assistant and being shown a 5 min health education video (in English, Gujarati, Punjabi, Urdu, Hindi or Bengali); a home visit and being shown a translated leaflet and fact sheet; a leaflet and fact sheet posted to the home address; and a control group that were not contacted.  For the home visit groups, 37% of the women given a leaflet and 47% of the women shown the video attended for cervical smears within 4 months of intervention; the difference between these groups was not significant.  Uptake was not correlated with age or education.  Hindus has a higher uptake (49%) than Moslems (34%) or Sikhs (31%), although these differences were, once again, not statistically significant.  Only 11% of those posted a leaflet and 5% of those not contacted had a smear test during the same period.

Black-Caribbean people display a higher degree of inter-ethnic partnership than South Asian people and are more likely to live in social rented accommodation, and hence display a lower degree of spatial segregation from other ethnic groups.  The consequence of a high degree of segregation is that the Census data for the ED or neighbourhood in which the person invited to take part in the screening Pilot resides is quite likely to describe their socio-economic and other characteristics; conversely, for less segregated ethnic groups it is much less accurate to make this inference.","cites":null},{"id":36946918,"title":"Colorectal Cancer Screening Pilot are shown in Table 6.2.2.

A randomised-controlled trial was conducted of 3 different models of delivery of preventive services to 1,224 male outpatients.  These included: a) use of a physician-orientated paper reminder involving education and motivation and chart flow sheets, listing recommended activities together with periodic feedback to physicians on their performance; b) use of a patient education model whereby patients were posted an information brochure designed to encourage them to ask for preventive services which were outlined in a patient-held pocket guide; c) use of a patient invitation letter to attend a health promotion clinic.  The 3 means of delivering preventative medicine were compared with a control group.  The study findings indicated that only reminder intervention c) resulted in measurable improvements relative to the control group.  Rates for faecal occult blood testing increased from 22% to 78% during the first year, were sustained for 5 years, and were statistically significant. Costs were also measured and demonstrate that a letter invitation to attend a health promotion clinic will be cost-effective.  2.7  UK cancer screening intervention studies (see Table A4.4 in Appendix A4)  \u2022  UK intervention studies almost exclusively focus on South Asian women; research on Chinese, AfricanCaribbean and other minority women is largely lacking.  Almost all studies use the meta-category 'South Asian' rather than considering Asian sub-groups.  \u2022  There is limited UK research on interventions to improve cervical cancer screening uptake by Asian women.  The only trial identified that home visits are more effective than a postal leaflet.  International studies provide some evidence of the greater effectiveness of a linkworker versus a patient reminder letter for improving uptake by ethnic minority women.  \u2022  For breast cancer screening, a large number of UK studies have evaluated letter\/ telephone follow up, linkworkers and 'multi-strategy' interventions.  The use of a reminder letter appears to have a limited role in improving uptake by ethnic minorities.  Unlike cervical cancer screening, there also appears to be no evidence that home visits by a linkworker are effective in improving uptake.  \u2022  The only UK study to examine the cost-effectiveness of interventions to improve breast screening uptake by ethnic minority women reports that a GP letter is more cost-effective than a flag in patient notes; linkworkers were not included in the trial.  \u2022  There is evidence from studies in London, Cardiff, Bradford and Berkshire that a multifaceted strategy can lead to a relatively high ethnic uptake of breast (and cervical) screening.  The cost-effectiveness of such an intervention has not been assessed.   The literature on evaluation of interventions to improve cervical\/ breast screening uptake by ethnic minority populations in the UK is much more extensive than the US literature on CRC screening interventions. Most studies focus on South Asian women and, once again, research on African-Caribbean women is largely missing. 31   Ethnicity: UK Colorectal Cancer Screening Pilot  Studies do not normally consider Asian sub-groups and instead report findings for the meta-category 'South Asian'.  Only one paper considers cervical cancer screening and one both breast and cervical cancer screening; the remainder report on intervention to improve uptake of breast screening.","cites":null},{"id":1166860,"title":"Predictors of older adults' participation in fecal occult blood screening.

These data include a table on the religious breakdown of the population.  We have used this to make very tentative estimates of CRC screening uptake rates, by applying the regression coefficients presented in Table 6.2.4 to population data for 2001.  Preliminary results are shown in Tables 6.2.5 \u2013 6.2.9, including predictions for all unitary and shire authorities and Government Office Regions in England, together with unitary authorities and local authority districts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Table 6.2.5 shows that the overall predicted uptake rate for England is 58.1%.  Regional rates within England vary from a high of 60.1% (South West) to a low of 54.7% (London), followed by 56.9% (West Midlands). Table 6.2.6 presents the uptake rates for the top 20 unitary authorities in England with the highest predicted CRC screening uptakes, and for the 20 likely to have the lowest uptakes (see Appendix A10 for predicted uptake rates for all unitary authorities in England).  Tables 6.2.7, 6.2.8 and 6.2.9 present the predicted uptake rates for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively.  For Wales the overall predicted uptake is 58.8%; for Scotland 58.9%; and for Northern Ireland 58.7%.  The range of predicted uptakes is smaller in these three countries.  In Wales, uptake is predicted to be highest in Powys (60 per cent) and lowest in Blaenau Gwent (56.7 per cent).  In Scotland, the highest uptakes are predicted in East Lothian, Mid Lothian and East Dunbartonshire (60.6 per cent each) and the lowest in Glasgow (56.2 per cent).  In Northern Ireland, predicted uptake is highest in Castlereagh (61.5 per cent) and lowest in Derry (54.8 per cent).

Understanding beliefs and attitudes concerning response to FOBt versus non-response 2.  Evaluating psychological distress following FOBt invitation 3.  Comparing Asian versus White-European responses to FOBt.  3.2.2  METHODS The preliminary analysis using Census data, carried out at the outset of the study to estimate the approximate total number of each ethnic minority group available for survey in the English Pilot site area (see section 1.3.1), indicated that the figures for all but one of the main Asian groups (Sikh) were approximately equal to (or less than in the case of Bengalis) the total number required for the psychosocial survey sample for that group.  This preliminary analysis therefore demonstrated that those who had already been invited to screening by the time the ethnicity study started would also need to be included in the psychosocial survey in order to generate a large enough sample.  This necessitated a change of design to a retrospective survey rather than the prospective approach initially planned.  The pilot Nam Pehchan runs confirmed that all the main ethnic minority groups (except the Sikh group) would need to be sampled in their entirety for the psychosocial survey, because they were relatively small.  3.2.2.1 Sampling 1.  Samples have been drawn with the aim of achieving 250 survey participants amongst each of (a) Hindu-Gujerati (b) Hindu-other (c) Muslim (d) Sikh-Punjabi with the aim of including equal numbers of FOBt responders and non-responders.  Ethnicity was determined by applying the Nam-Pehchan programme to patient surnames. 2.  Sufficient numbers were only available for the Sikh-Punjabi group.  A random sample was drawn from this population.  For all other groups, a 100% sample was surveyed.","cites":null},{"id":1166835,"title":"Systematic review of ethnicity and health service access for London.","authors":[],"date":"2001","doi":null,"raw":"Atkinson M, Clark M, Clay D, Johnson M, Szczepura A.

Both univariate and multivariate analyses were undertaken to produce respectively unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  The five distinct religion-language groups identified using Nam Pehchan were: Hindu-Gujerati, Hindu-Other, Muslim, Sikh and Other Asian.  As discussed in section 1.3.2 (and illustrated in Table 1.3.2) features that distinguish these groups from one another include the nature of their diet (vegetarian, non-vegetarian, consumption of red meat etc.) and their literacy levels, as well as their language and religion.

This is because, once a subject was identified as FOBt positive, their willingness to continue with the process initiated by the FOBt screening test might be recorded in a number of different ways in the data files.  We therefore identified any evidence of a willingness to undergo further examinations or interventions. Thus, if the subject was found in any data file to have attended a nurse pre- and post-colonoscopy appointment, undergone colonoscopy, had a histopathology test result recorded, undergone surgery, or attended for oncological or radiological treatment, then this was taken as an indication that s\/he had expressed a willingness to take up further CRC procedures (diagnostic and\/or therapeutic).  In addition, the English pilot site's computerised nurse data sets were examined.  They were also used to determine whether failure to perform colonoscopy was due to the subject\u2019s medical unfitness or other reasons.

In terms of ethnicity, Table 6.2.2 indicates that none of the country of birth variables are statistically significant at the 5 per cent level, and that there is a negative sign only for the two measures of South Asian population (i.e. not for those born in the Caribbean).  In Table 6.2.3, a similar pattern emerges; the adjusted 1991 ethnicity variables are now statistically significant at the 5 per cent level for the Indian ethnic group, and again there is a negative sign only for the two South Asian ethnic groups (and not for the Black ethnic group).  Both models exhibit a positive sign for African Caribbean\/ Black ethnic groups and estimate a mean uptake rate of around 60%, keeping other variables constant.  The most powerful influence on variations in uptake is the unemployment rate, indicating that the higher the level of unemployment, the lower the level of uptake.  The coefficients on the Carstairs index reinforce the association of low uptake with deprivation.","cites":null},{"id":1166859,"title":"Task force on Minority Health.

The English Pilot site commenced screening in September 2000; it is based at Hospital of St. Cross, Rugby. The two Pilot centres have largely followed the same screening protocol (which was determined as part of the commissioning process).  All of the tests and associated information were sent to the target population from the screening Units.  All FOB test kits were returned to the Units for testing and results sent to the individual direct from the office.  Following an overall positive result individuals were provided with an appointment to see a specialist nurse to explain the result and the implications of further diagnostic investigations.   In the first instance this has been colonoscopy, with barium enema undertaken if the colonoscopy has been incomplete.  There were some procedural differences between the two sites, particularly relating to the scheduling of appointments and provision of information on results of tests and investigations.  In England, all individuals were invited for an appointment with a nurse, regardless of their FOBt result. However, part-way through the course of the Pilot it was considered that appointments for test-negative individuals were not generally being taken up and, indeed, that the invitation may cause unnecessary anxiety.  The protocol was, therefore, changed to only offer appointments to test-positive (or weakly positive) individuals.  All participants who underwent colonoscopy (or other investigation) were also given a nurse appointment to provide the results of this procedure.  In Scotland, test results were also sent to participants, and those with \u2018positive\u2019 results were offered a nurse appointment.

The crucial point made by many authors is that the categorisation used must be 'fit for purpose' i.e. it must be relevant to the delivery of the service being considered and to the recognition of client need.

The latter formed the basis of the main screening and colonoscopy uptake analyses (see sections 3.1 and 4.1).  As part of the main uptake analyses, a database was constructed that included an individual's NHS number, age, sex, a religion and language indicator (identified using Nam Pehchan), a deprivation indicator (Carstairs index), and the screening history of the individual.  This database contained the full (7 character, or \u2018unit\u2019) postcode for each person used to calculate the Carstairs index.

These EDs typically contain about 200 households, and are often regarded as representing reasonably socially homogeneous 'neighbourhoods', because of the tendency of people of similar types to live in similar areas (Timms, 1971).

Uptake and Acceptability of Colonoscopy by Ethnic Minorities  Chapter  Summary  \u2022  Large variations in uptake of colonoscopy amongst FOBt positives were observed for different ethnic groups, with an overall uptake of 54.9% for Asians vs 74.4% for non-Asians.  \u2022  This effect remains after adjusting for potential confounding factors such as differences in age, gender, and deprivation patterns.  Colonoscopy uptake by Asians is still half that of non-Asians (p<0.01).  \u2022  Within the Asian population, Hindu-Gujerati and Muslim groups demonstrate significantly (p<0.05) lower uptake levels.  \u2022  A much higher proportion of Asian patients refused to continue (19.6% vs 8.3% for non-Asians). Further research may be required to understand specific reasons associated with non-uptake.  \u2022  A higher percentage of FOBt positive Asian patients were still \u2018under process\u2019 (i.e. had not reached a firm decision 3 months after receipt of a positive FOBt result).  Part of the lower uptake may be due to a longer period needed to make a decision about colonoscopy.  \u2022  The psychosocial survey of different ethnic groups, received responses from too few FOBt positives to be able to examine factors influencing colonoscopy uptake.  \u2022  The focus groups also offered few clues that might explain the apparently higher rates of refusal, and lower uptake, of colonoscopy.  Clearly there was very little knowledge about the procedure, but equally, when it was explained to the groups, the general response was positive.  \u2022  Other factors that might have impacted on uptake include \u2013 as for FOBt screening - lack of literacy, reliance on family members to read (and relate) postal communications, and mobility (absences during critical periods, for family visits or religious trips) affecting availability.  67   Ethnicity: UK Colorectal Cancer Screening Pilot 4.1  Analyses of Routine Data  4.1.1 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES To analyse routine data downloaded from the pilot data sets to investigate colonoscopy uptake by different ethnic groups among FOBt positives and investigate associations of ethnic descriptors with the following aspects of uptake:  \u2022  Decision to respond to the offer of colonoscopy \u2022  Completion of colonoscopy \u2022  Reasons for failure to undergo colonoscopy  4.1.2 METHODS  4.1.2.1  Data download and preparation of data files for analysis Data used for the analysis of ethnic colonoscopy uptake rates were extracted from a data download taken from the English Pilot site on 1\/6\/02 (see Table 4.1.1).  A total of 179,305 records were downloaded.  As explained (see section 3.1.2), individuals were tagged with a language\/ religion \u2018ethnicity\u2019 indicator using the Nam Pehchan software applied to a separate download of individuals\u2019 names.  A total of 178,946 records had ethnic indicators attached.  In addition, a deprivation indicator (Carstairs index) was similarly attached to each individual's record based on their full postcode.  The resulting data file was checked extensively, and records corrected to remove any inconsistencies (see section 3.1.2.2).  A total of 1,285 individuals had a positive FOBt result that was recorded at least 3 months before the date of the data download and were therefore eligible for examination of colonoscopy uptake rate (see Table 4.1.1).","cites":null}],"documentType":{"type":1}},"contributors":[],"datePublished":"2003-07","abstract":null,"downloadUrl":"","fullTextIdentifier":null,"pdfHashValue":null,"publisher":null,"rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n        \n            \n                oai:www.dora.dmu.ac.uk:2086\/2079<\/identifier><datestamp>\n                2012-07-17T12:03:26Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n                com_2086_82<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_2086_1216<\/setSpec>\n            <\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:doc=\"http:\/\/www.lyncode.com\/xoai\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n            \nEthnicity: UK colorectal cancer screening pilot \u2013 Final report<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\nSzczepura, A.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nJohnson, Mark, 1948 Mar. 16-<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nOrbell, S.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nGumber, A.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nO'Sullivan, I.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nClay, D.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nOwen, D.<\/dc:creator><dc:date>\n2009-07-24T11:29:46Z<\/dc:date><dc:date>\n2009-07-24T11:29:46Z<\/dc:date><dc:date>\n2003-07<\/dc:date><dc:type>\nWorking Paper<\/dc:type><dc:identifier>\nSzczepura.
