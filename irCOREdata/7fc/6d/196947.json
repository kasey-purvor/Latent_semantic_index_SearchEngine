Introduction \nSince the 1970\/80s, various processes of economic globalisation have eroded established \nfoundations of labour. A series of those changes have been analysed in labour and industrial \nrelations research, however, a curious disjunction has occurred in analysing the implications of \nhow global production is being restructured. While labour has recognised the value of chain and \nnetwork concepts of global production for developing new strategies (Quan 2008; Women \nWorking Worldwide 2004; Lund & Wright 2003), academic industrial relations research has so far \nmade little of the implications of these concepts for labour. Economic globalisation has led to a \nfunctional integration of production activities (Dicken 2007); multinational corporations (MNCs) \nhave become key actors in restructuring nationally-based production systems into global and \nregional inter-firm networks as well as in coordinating and controlling these complex value chains \n(Dicken 2007; Gereffi & Korzeniewicz 1994). Arguably these developments constitute a \u2018global \nshift\u2019 in the terrain on which labour strategises and campaigns.  \n \n4 \nWe use one relevant approach \u2013 global value chain (GVC) analysis \u2013 to explore two different, but \ninterrelated, aspects of how GVCs structure capital-labour relations: first, power in work, \nemployment and industrial relations transcends organisational and institutional boundaries, that is \nacross enterprises and sectors. Second, there are important shifts in the way power is distributed \nover the spheres of production and consumption, with GVC restructuring being dominated more \nand more by retailers and branded marketers. Such developments obviously have implications for \nlabour relations at the company and sector level, but also for forms of international trade union \ncooperation. While GVC analysis has not in itself dealt much with issues of labour and industrial \nrelations, it offers a useful tool to analyse the global political economy in which labour operates \nand helps to draw out crucial implications for how power is distributed in the employment \nrelationship.  \nThis \u2018global shift\u2019 in labour\u2019s terrain across space and scale has been reflected in the evolution of \ninternational labour strategies vis-\u00e0-vis MNCs as well as in more recent attempts at regulating \nwork, employment and labour relations at the international level. While developments around \nWorld Works Councils and internationally coordinated bargaining strategies within MNCs in the \n1960\/70s focused on \u2018intra-firm\u2019 and \u2018inter-national\u2019 strategies, particularly in the automobile, \nchemical and food industries (e.g. Gallin 2008), labour campaigns in the following decades \ntargeted the \u2018inter-governmental\u2019 level and \u2018global\u2019 tools to link labour standards with trade \nregulation within the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) and later the WTO \n(World Trade Organisation) (van Roozendaal 2002). These efforts proved unsuccessful, \nindicating a need for labour to build new forms of international cooperation.  \nWhat has emerged is a multi-faceted approach which involves union networks across different \ngeographical places and scales, and links trade unions, community organisations, labour friendly \nnon-governmental organisations (NGOs) as well as consumer campaigning organisations (Herod \n \n5 \n2001, Wills 2001). Multi-lateral norms, particularly the International Labour Organisation\u2019s core \nlabour standards (ILO 1998), are central to many campaigns which have resulted in new \nregulatory tools at the company level (e.g. so-called International Framework Agreements - IFAs; \nsee Hammer 2008; 2005) and private social standards (PSSs) (e.g. multi-stakeholder codes at \nindustry level; see O\u2019Rourke 2006; Weil & Mallo 2007).1 What is key here is the attempt to \nimplement and enforce labour standards via the power of lead MNCs, creditors, or international \norganisations in supplier and subcontractor companies along the supply chain.  \nThus, both from an analytic as well as a strategic perspective global restructuring has challenged \nestablished approaches to social regulation as well as labour and industrial relations. Shifts in \nglobal production have underlined the role different forms of GVC governance and inter-firm \ncoordination play in structuring the organisational and spatial links between the spheres of \nproduction, retail, and consumption. We argue that analyses of labour in the global economy \nneed to take account of how GVCs shape the terrain for labour to build international networks, \nstrategies and campaigns for labour rights. Furthermore, analyses of GVC restructuring and \ngovernance itself need to integrate the role of labour in shaping global value production as well as \nin \u2018actively produc[ing] economic spaces and scales in particular ways\u2019 (Herod, 2001; 46). In this paper we \nargue, that GVC governance frames key elements of labour\u2019s strategic terrain as well as the ways \nin which it can use tools such as IFAs and PSSs to socially regulate GVCs. Based on case studies \nof the cut flower and banana value chains, we widen the use of GVC analysis and theoretically \nexplore its value in investigating the scope for different labour rights strategies and forms of \nsocial regulation. In the following section we provide a critical overview of relevant GVC \nconcepts and link them to an understanding of labour\u2019s embeddedness and agency. On the basis \nof this framework, Section 3 discusses extensive case studies of the banana and cut flower value \nchains, assessing how forms of GVC governance structure the way power is distributed along \n \n6 \nchains and how, in reverse, labour might use IFAs and PSSs to shape value chains via the power \nof lead firms. The conclusion expands on the theoretical implications GVCs have for labour \nstrategies to advance labour rights as well as for international trade union cooperation.  \n \n2. Putting Labour Into Global Value Chains \nWhat conventionally is subsumed under GVC analysis is, in fact, a relatively broad church \nstemming from different phases of theory development as well as different disciplines (see e.g. \nBair 2009; Bair 2008; Gibbon et al. 2008). What lies at the heart of these debates is the extent to \nwhich a differentiated concept of value chain and network governance can be developed while \nappreciating the embeddedness of different nodes in the chain. In order to analyse labour in \nGVCs, we argue, both the concepts of power and embeddedness are crucial. We adopt the \nnotion of \u2018governance as drivenness\u2019 (Bair 2009; Gereffi 1994) which underscores the power of \nlead firms to shape rules along a value chain (as opposed to the focus on \u2018governance as \ncoordination\u2019 between two links in the chain, Gereffi et al. 2005) 2. At the same time we \nemphasise the embedded nature of labour and production (Castree et al. 2004; Hess 2008). With \nregard to GVC analysis we look at three concepts in particular: the functional division of labour \nin GVCs, the degree to which firms drive the chain, and the mechanisms through which this \ndrivenness operates. With regard to an adequate notion of labour agency in GVCs it is important \nto analyse how particular forms of GVC governance shape the terrain for labour agency as well \nas the role labour plays in shaping GVC governance. GVCs need to be treated as an emergent \nphenomenon with its particular structures and power relations that constrain and enable \nstrategies by collective labour in particular ways; at the same time, labour agency needs to be \n \n7 \nunderstood in the context of the embedded nature of social relations of production. In fact, some \nlabour campaigns against lead firms in GVCs combine global links along the chain with \ncommunity-based strategies (Wills 2001). By emphasising the interrelations between the \nreorganisation of inter-firm networks on the one hand, and labour agency transcending space and \nscale on the other, we link GVC analysis to labour geography.  \nGVC Governance and Power: The Terrain for Labour \nThe issue of power in inter-firm networks is elaborated in work on governance in GVCs by \nGereffi, defined as \u201cauthority and power relationships that determine how financial, material, and \nhuman resources are allocated and flow within a chain\u201d (1994: 97). Governance thus refers to the \nprocess of organising activities across organisations with the purpose of achieving a certain \nfunctional division of labour along a value chain. Initially, Gereffi focused on the functional position \nof powerful firms and distinguished between two forms of overall chain governance \u2013 producer- \nand buyer-driven value chains. The former are usually found in sectors with high technological \nand capital requirements which means that GVC governance is shaped very much by firms that \ncontrol technological and productive assets. In buyer-driven chains it is information costs, \nproduct design, advertising and advanced supply management systems that set the entry barriers. \nIn these chains production functions are usually outsourced, leaving key decisions on what is to \nbe produced, by whom, and in what ways to the retailers and brand name companies (Gereffi \n1994). Thus, the functional division of labour in GVCs, based on the division of economic rents \n(stemming from technology, trade policy, etc.), results in specific distributions of gains, and sets \nterms of participation and of exclusion (Ponte 2008).  \nThis, abbreviated, conceptual core of GVC analysis has been criticised and developed further \nfrom within as well as by alternative approaches. Issue was taken with the polarity and linearity of \n \n8 \nGVCs, the degree and mechanisms through which power in GVCs is exercised, and with regard \nto the embeddedness of local-global production networks. First, the overall chain dichotomy and \nmetaphor was blurred in that notions of polarity and linearity were qualified (Henderson et al. \n2002; Smith et al. 2002). The distinction between buyer- and producer-driven GVCs neither \ncaptures the full range nor the dynamics of value chain governance. The categories of \u2018buyer\u2019 and \n\u2018producer\u2019 cover a variety of types of lead firms who may \u2018drive\u2019 chains in different ways; buyers, \nfor example, include retailers, branded marketers, industrial processors and international traders. \nFurthermore, value chains are not necessarily unipolar (i.e. driven by one category of lead firms) \nor organised according to one linear \u2018strand\u2019. Regarding the latter, for example, we show that not \nall lead firms exercise upstream power3 through similarly organised inter-firm networks; in fact \ndifferent value chain \u2018strands\u2019 can overlap. Regarding the former, we show that value chains can \nbe bipolar, i.e. driven by two lead firms located in different functional positions (Fold 2002; Stur-\ngeon 2002). This is the case for the banana value chain which also shows how some GVCs can \nmove from one category to the other. In some producer-driven chains, for example, producers \nare increasingly outsourcing production or component manufacture while keeping control of \npromotion and marketing of the brand names on which market access is based \u2013 thereby blurring \nthe overall chain dichotomy in favour of buyer-driven features (Ponte 2008; Sturgeon et al. 2008). \nThese differentiations in GVC concepts allow a clearer view of the inter-firm linkages and power \ndynamics that structure labour\u2019s strategic terrains (e.g. within the same industry or place). \nSecond, what is important beyond the functional position of powerful firms, is the degree and \nmechanisms through which GVCs are \u2018driven\u2019 by one or several categories of lead firms. \u201cThe \n\u2018drivenness\u2019 of buyer-driven chains derives from the role of powerful lead firms in making and \nenforcing decisions about product design and manufacturing processes used in the chain\u201d (Dolan \n& Humphrey, 2004; 492). Drivenness is a measurement of power and describes the capability in \n \n9 \ndetermining the functional division of labour along the value chain, in setting quality and other \ndemands, and in dictating the terms of participation or exclusion, as well as the rewards of \nparticipation. It can be seen on a continuum from highly to not driven at all (Ponte 2008). What \nis crucial for labour here are the mechanisms through which firms drive GVCs. Lead firms can \ndrive GVCs in a hands-on way, a hands-off way and the wide spectrum in between. Hands-on \ndrivenness, for example, is characterised by long-term contracts, explicit control of suppliers and \nregular engagement between suppliers and buyers. It refers to relations where power is exerted \ndirectly by lead firms on suppliers, in a way which, in its extreme, is comparable to the direct \nmanagerial control that headquarters might exert over subordinates in an offshore subsidiary or \naffiliate of a vertically integrated firm. Conversely, hands-off drivenness is characterised by the \nuse of specifications that can be transmitted in codified and measurable or auditable ways and the \nability to set standards that are followed along a GVC (Kaplinsky & Morris 2008; Ponte & \nGibbon 2005).  \nThird, while successive debates have led to a differentiation of the concepts of GVC governance \nand embeddedness (Bair, 2009; 356; Bair 2008; Gibbon et al. 2008; Hess 2008), it seems crucial to \nretain both a concept of power and embeddedness. This is particularly relevant for an analysis of \nthe local and institutional embeddedness of labour as an actor in emergent networks of global \nproduction. A useful concept in this regard is that of local labour control regimes (LLCRs) (see \nCastree et al. 2004) which are defined as  \n[a] historically contingent and territorially embedded set of mechanisms which coordinate \nthe reciprocities between production, work, consumption and labour reproduction within a \nlocal labour market. (Jonas, 1996; 325) \n \n10 \nIt can be assumed that producer-driven chains integrate local labour markets in different ways \nthan buyer-driven chains (e.g. along dimensions such as skills, wages, employment and industrial \nrelations regulations) and thereby shape LLCRs. Conversely, as highlighted in the experience of \nSpecial Economic Zones, the specific constitution of LLCRs shapes the way local production is \nlinked into GVCs. Certainly with regard to \u2018governance as drivenness\u2019, we would see \nembeddedness as conceptualised in the literature on global production networks and LLCRs \nmore complementary than competing with GVC concepts (see also Bair 2008; Sturgeon et al. \n2008). The governance of value chains remains central for understanding how power is exerted \nand distributed in GVCs. Governance, we argue, should therefore also be central when analysing \nlabour\u2019s strategic options and room for manoeuvre. \nPlacing Labour in the GVC Framework  \nIn the beginning we stated a paradox in that labour has made use of (supply) chain concepts for \ndeveloping strategies (Lund & Wright 2003; Quan 2008; Women Working Worldwide 2004) \nwhile academic approaches have left labour largely out of global chain and network concepts. \nMost engagement of GVC concepts with labour has either been concerned with the impact of \nchain restructuring on work and employment, or with labour\u2019s options to exploit the brand \nsensitivity of end-buyers. So far, however, there has been little systematic exploration of the \nimpact of GVC governance on capital-labour relations. Linking those intentions, Bair and \nRamsay\u2019s (2003) article constitutes an exception as they develop a contingency approach on the \nimplications of different value chain dynamics for labour. Here, a consideration of MNCs\u2019 \noptions and leverage to outsource functions and relocate production serves as a basis to analyse \nlabour\u2019s strategic leverage points in GVCs. While yielding interesting insights, however, such a \ncontingency approach tends to underestimate the role of power stemming from chain \ngovernance or, in other words, the strategic selectivity of GVC governance for labour.  \n \n11 \nThe social regulation of GVCs has been addressed, mainly through analyses of the most visible \ntools of shaping work and employment along value chains: private social standards (PSSs) and \nInternational Framework Agreements (IFAs). On one hand, the GVC framework has been used \nto analyse how value chain restructuring has consequences for working conditions and \nemployment at the point of production. Bair and Gereffi (2001), for example, asses the diverse \nconsequences of restructuring in the global apparel industry for workers in an industrial cluster in \nMexico while Locke et al. (2007) study the role of Nike\u2019s code of conduct for working conditions \nin its supply chain. Very advanced in this respect is research from a development angle: \nBarrientos (2003) uses the GVC framework to explore how organizational restructuring by global \nfirms has encouraged flexibilization and feminization of work at the production end of global \nvalue chains (see also Hale & Wills 2007; Oxfam 2004). Another strand, feeding into a critical \nevaluation of corporate social responsibility, explores the gender sensitivity of PSSs and combines \nglobal value chain and gendered economy approaches (Barrientos et al. 2003; Barrientos & Smith \n2007; Hale & Opondo 2005). These approaches all try to look at what GVCs mean for (local) \nlabour. However, they focus on the impact of inter-firm dynamics on work and employment and \nthereby largely neglect labour as a collective actor. This underestimates how local labour relations \ninfluence access to and the social regulation of (specific nodes in) GVCs, as well as the role of \nGVC governance on labour capacity. While we agree with the direction of these arguments \n(which broadens the scope of GVC analysis to include the impact on labour), we hold that GVC \nanalysis and labour agency have rarely been systematically integrated. \nGoing further, though, there is an emerging body of work that analyses PSSs and IFAs from the \nperspective of labour. While Riisgaard (2005) and Wills (2002) analyse labour campaigns to \nconclude IFAs, Riisgaard (2009) and Rodriguez-Garavito (2005) discuss how PSSs differ in the \ndegree to which they enable local labour organizations and workers to mobilize and organise. \n \n12 \nHale and Wills (2007) study labour agency at the supply end of GVCs and how links to Northern \nactivist groups and knowledge about supply chain linkages are used to pressure end-buyers into \ntaking responsibility for employment conditions at suppliers and sub-contractors. These studies \nto varying degrees highlight the benefits of integrating power in GVCs with the specific strategies \nof resistance by embedded labour. In this paper we seek to develop this endeavour further by \nsystematically analysing the way labour strategies are both constrained and enabled by particular \nforms of GVC governance. A brief revisit of the GVC concepts outlined above highlight what \ngovernance means for labour\u2019s room for manoeuvre.  \nImplications of GVC Governance for Labour \nTo start with, we have to recognise how the original distinction of producer- versus buyer-driven \nchains does retain some explanatory power with regard to labour\u2019s strategic options. The \nfundamental aspect here is that in buyer-driven (as opposed to producer-driven) value chains the \nworkplace is separated from the site of industrial and political power. Thus, while the lead firm in \nany chain is often distant from the actual point of production (via numerous tiers of suppliers), \nthe locus of power in buyer-driven chains lies not with the material production but with design, \nbranding, and retailing. Both, the (geographical) relocation as well as the (organisational) \noutsourcing of production were always based on exploitation of local labour control and factory \nregimes different from those in the Global North. However, it is the organisational and political \ndistance between the workplace and the driver of the chain that frames power in buyer-driven \nvalue chains. From the perspective of labour geography this underscores the social and political \ncharacter of place, space and scale and we would argue that it is labour coalitions beyond the \nworkplace that have a strategic advantage in a buyer-driven terrain, i.e. strategies that link \nworkplaces with local communities (in the South), other social movements, as well as consumer \norganisations (in the markets of the North).  \n \n13 \nBeyond the functional dynamic, it is the GVC\u2019s level of drivenness that underlies an MNC\u2019s \nleverage to impose criteria (e.g. labour standards) along the chain. Highly driven value chains, \nhowever, also open the strategic option of targeting the powerful actor(s) in the chain, the \ndriver(s), whereas labour will find it much more difficult to systematically tackle less driven \nchains, particularly when they are characterised by market-based relationships. What unites highly \ndriven value chains, indifferent of the functional position of the drivers, is the power and role of \nthe lead MNC(s) which provides an entry point for labour rights actors as well as potential \nleverage in conflicts. The mechanisms of drivenness \u2013 hands-on\/hands-off \u2013 describe how the \ncoordination of production is managed across organisational boundaries. In producer driven \nchains it is vertical integration or hands-on coordination that constitute the main entry point for \nlabour as they provide a relatively stable industrial and management structure (even though this \nmight be across company boundaries) for labour to negotiate with and campaign against (on the \nbasis of established union organisation). \nDifferent modes of GVC governance provide different rooms for manoeuvre for labour to \nregulate employment conditions along value chains. Equally, the capacity to shape GVC \ngovernance cannot be separated from the nature of embedded labour and the specific LLCRs \nand factory regimes. This is underlined by the context and proliferation of IFAs and PSSs. \nFramework agreements, for example, are found within traditionally producer-driven chains where \nthe structure of industrial and political power overlaps to a significant extent with established \nforms of union organisation and industrial action (coordinated through the Global Union \nFederations at the international level). PSSs, particularly when managed by multi-stakeholder \ninitiatives, are more flexible to include actors in \u2013 social movement and\/or consumer \u2013 spaces \nand scales that are better situated to exert counter-power vis-\u00e0-vis the industrial and political \npowers of buyer-driven chains. While a considerable number of IFAs are geared to the entire \n \n14 \nsupply chain of a particular MNC, PSSs\u2019 implementation and monitoring logic is often that of a \nplantation-by-plantation (or factory-by-factory) approach. In terms of chain coverage, both \nmechanisms are largely limited to regulating workers at the production level. IFAs and PSSs \nconstitute avenues for labour to shape the governance of value chains, by using the power of lead \nfirms for enforcement and transforming aspects of the employment relationship into entry \nbarriers for participation in the chain. The above analysis of labour in GVCs would suggest that \nIFAs and PSSs provide different strategic tools for labour, are relevant in different structural \n(GVC) contexts and answer different challenges to labour. The examples of the banana and cut \nflower value chains in the following section will illustrate and substantiate this argument. \n \n3. Labour in the Banana and Cut Flower Value \nChains \nWe now turn to the horticultural sector for an exploratory analysis of the connections between \nGVC governance, social regulation and labour agency. The chosen banana and cut flower value \nchains provide matched cases of labour intensive agricultural chains, each containing two distinct \nvalue chain strands (the main avenues for the products in the respective chains) with different \ngovernance structures and implications for labour and social regulation. In bananas, the focus is \non Latin American exports to the EU and the US, made up of a direct strand (where banana-\nMNCs export to large retailers) and a wholesale strand (where bananas pass through wholesalers \nin the end markets). Here we find an IFA, achieved on the back of a historically strong labour \norganisation in the Latin American banana industry (as opposed to anywhere else in banana \n \n15 \nproduction). The African cut flower chain to European consumer markets shows a direct value \nchain strand (where flowers are imported directly by large retailers) and an auction strand (where \nflowers pass through the Dutch auction system). In this case it is PSSs, initiated in consumer \nmarkets and based on a broad coalition of actors that aim to secure labour rights at the \nworkplace.  \nBoth cases are based on extensive field research (for details, see Riisgaard 2009). Work on the \nIFA in bananas involved visits to 12 plantations, Chiquita owned and Chiquita suppliers, in \nGuatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica and Nicaragua. 61 interviews were conducted in 2002 with \nbanana workers as well as union and Chiquita representatives at local, national and regional level. \nThe research on cut flowers covered all (10) export flower farms in Tanzania and 10 farms (out \nof approximately 150) in Kenya (carried out in 2006). A total of 93 interviews were conducted at \nnational as well as district- and farm-branch level with management, worker and union repre-\nsentatives, and labour NGOs as well as industry organizations, industry consultants, and standard \norganizations.  \n3.1 TARGETING PRODUCER AND BUYER POWER IN THE BANANA \nGVC \nTraditionally, the international banana value chain was producer-driven, with the large banana-\nMNCs playing a dominant role in setting the rules of the game. The five biggest banana operators \n(Dole Food Company, Chiquita, Fresh Del Monte, Noboa and Fyffes) continue to control \naround 80% of world exports (Kasteele & Stichele 2005). However, this producer-driven \noligopoly has come under attack in recent decades.  \n \n16 \nOn the one hand, banana MNCs were challenged as increasing concentration and consolidation \nin retail chains have allowed the latter to exert a higher degree of influence over the value chain. \nRetailers increasingly determine conditions of production and distribution, create competition \namong producer MNCs for preferred supplier status, and thereby reap a higher share of the \nprofits (Kasteele & Stichele 2005; UNCTAD 2003). On the other hand, over the last 20 years \nbanana MNCs have moved away from direct growing in order to focus on more specific \nmarketing and distribution activities. However, the degree of outsourcing varies between \ncompanies. Chiquita has so far maintained around 40-50% of its production in-house; Fresh Del \nMonte, Dole and Noboa retain 28%, 25% and 20% respectively of own production, while Fyffes \nhas no plantations of its own (Kasteele & Stichele 2005). This direct strand of the banana value \nchain can thus be said to be moving from a producer-driven strand (driven by vertically \nintegrated banana-MNCs) towards a more buyer-driven and bipolar strand (driven by large \nretailers and by MNCs which increasingly are outsourcing direct ownership of production). \nAlthough the big banana-MNCs control around 80% of world exports, other market channels \nalso exist. The remaining 20% of exports are very fragmented, and mainly consist of independent \ngrowers selling to smaller exporting companies onto importers, ripeners and wholesalers. How-\never, this value chain strand often still uses parts of the infrastructure controlled by the large ba-\nnana-MNCs (Kasteele & Stichele 2005; UNCTAD 2003). In Figure 1 we contrast a direct strand \nof the value chain (illustrated via Chiquita) with the wholesale oriented strand of the value chain. \nInsert Figure 1 about here. \nBrand-sensitive buyers and producers in the direct strand are able to drive the chain and build \nvery hands-on forms of control over the up-stream part of the chain. For example, banana \nMNCs increasingly establish long term supply contracts with independent growers, specifying \n \n17 \nshapes, quantities, standards of quality, packaging etc. In many cases they provide inputs in order \nto control quality and exercise a \u2018hands-on\u2019 coordination of suppliers via regular inspections \n(UNCTAD 2006). Dole, for example, employs hundreds of quality assurance professionals \naround the world to inspect fresh products produced by independent growers but carrying the \nDole brand name (Dole undated). In Ecuador Favorita sources most of its bananas from \nindependent growers but still controls management decisions at the farm level, such as when to \nspray against the pest \u2018sigatoga negra\u2019 which is carried out by a Favorita subsidiary (Hellin & \nHigman 2002). The leading MNCs are involved in production, packing, transport and ripening \nwhich gives them a high degree of control over the production end of the value chain, both in \nterms of setting quality and price demands with suppliers and also in terms of pressuring host \ncountries on issues of taxation, labour regulation and environmental legislation (Frundt 2007). \nLarge EU and US retailers, on the other hand, exert power over producer MNCs by working \nwith one or two year contracts while discounters like Aldi and Lidl buy on the spot market \n(Kasteele & Stichele 2005).  \nValue chain restructuring has entailed retail consolidation and the rationalization of production \nwhich includes outsourcing, the transfer of production to lower cost and\/or low union density \nareas as well as an increase in the use of third party labour contractors (Kasteele & Stichele 2005; \nPrieto-Carr\u00f3n 2006; Riisgaard 2005). Labour is threatened by the relocation of production to \ndifferent labour control regimes such as the non-union, low pay supplier plantations of Ecuador \nand the pacific coast of Guatemala. In addition, rationalisation has meant a move towards looser \ncontract forms and anti-union policies such as discrimination, firing and blacklisting (Frundt \n2007; Human Rights Watch 2002; Quesada 2001). Thus, while labour\u2019s bargaining position is \nweakened by regime competition, the bipolar nature of a major part of the banana value chain \u2013 \ntogether with a history of tireless organising efforts in Honduras, Costa Rica, Panam\u00e1 and \n \n18 \nColombia \u2013 has also opened opportunities to shape working conditions at various levels. For \nexample, mandatory social and environmental standards have emerged at national level, such as \nthe improvement programme in the banana plantations of Colombia (Kasteele & Stichele 2005; \nPrieto-Carr\u00f3n 2006); MNCs have introduced SA8000 on owned farms (Chiquita, Dole) and \njoined the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) (Chiquita, Fyffes) (Kasteele & Stichele 2005)4; and up-\nmarket supermarkets increasingly carry fair trade and socially certified products (UNCTAD \n2003). The Latin American trade unions were able to exploit this constellation by signing the first \nIFA in the agricultural sector as well as via their involvement in PSSs.  \nChiquita has, since the 1990s, sought to promote brand awareness as the industry\u2019s leading CSR \ncompany, starting with environmental certification through the Better Banana Project with the \nRainforest Alliance in 1995, followed by the adoption of a company code of conduct (2000), \nSA8000 certification and membership of the ETI. In June 2001, following a damaging \ninternational campaign which accused the banana giant of violating workers\u2019 rights on Chiquita \nowned and supplier plantations in Latin America, an IFA was signed between the IUF \n(International Union of Food Workers), COLSIBA (Coordinadora Latinoamericana de \nSindicatos Bananeros) and Chiquita (IUF et al. 2001). The campaign was led by COLSIBA \u2013 a \nregional coordinating body representing 42 farm-level unions and 45,000 workers across \nEcuador, Colombia, Costa Rica, Panam\u00e1, Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala (COLSIBA 2001) \n\u2013 and was based on workplace organisation, transatlantic cooperation with solidarity groups in \nconsumer markets, and public campaigns targeting major supermarket chains and consumers in \nthe US and EU (Riisgaard 2005). The IFA marks the development of COLSIBA from a cross-\nborder alliance that emerged in the early 1990s to a labour actor that cooperates with Northern \nNGOs and leverages threats to disrupt, both, production at Chiquita plantations as well as \n \n19 \nconsumption via campaigns targeted at Chiquita and retailers selling Chiquita bananas. As noted \nby COLSIBA coordinator German Zepeda,  \nBefore this we had never explored the international market, we were simply workers. We \ndidn\u2019t know anything about the transnationals, about the market, about costs (Interview \n2002).     \nThe agreement commits the company to respect the ILO core conventions on freedom of \nassociation and the right to collective bargaining as well as convention 135 on the protection and \nfacilities guaranteed to workers' representatives. A Review Committee, composed of \nrepresentatives designated by the IUF, COLSIBA and Chiquita, will meet twice a year to review \nthe agreement\u2019s application. The agreement also covers sourcing from Latin America and \ncontains guidelines on the procedures to be invoked in the event of changes or transfers in \nproduction. In practice, results with the agreement have been mixed (see Frundt, 2007; 101-106; \nRiisgaard 2005;). Overall, management-labour dialogue has improved and the agreement has been \nsuccessfully invoked in several occasions e.g. to include continued union recognition when \nChiquita sold its operations in Colombia. However, Chiquita has also closed plantations in \nGuatemala without prior consultation (although required by the IFA). Enforcement of the IFA at \nsuppliers has proven particularly delicate because it implies Chiquita withdrawing contracts in the \nevent of continued non-compliance leading to loss of jobs. In the words of the COLSIBA \ncoordinator: \u201cWhat is COLSIBA to do when the agreement is not respected and the medicine in \na way is worse than the disease?\u201d (Interview 2002). Thus, while the IFA allows limited \nimprovements in organising and working conditions, relocation of production to non-union \nareas, as well as outsourcing to suppliers or labour contractors pose continuous challenges to \nmaintain a meaningful implementation of the agreement.  \n \n20 \nOn the other hand, unions started to challenge buyer power via their involvement in PSSs. In \n2005, for example, COLSIBA obtained an agreement with Transfair \u2013 the leading US fair trade \ngroup \u2013 under which union-backed bananas would be sold as fair trade bananas in the US \n(USleap undated). Although the agreement with Transfair did not survive (for details see Frundt \n2007) it still illustrates how labour seeks to make actual union recognition an inherent element of \na PSS. Another example is the IUF involvement in the ETI (a UK based multi-stakeholder \ninitiative) as board member, which offers a platform to engage the retail drivers of the direct \nstrand of the banana and flower value chain. The IUF and several large retailers have been \ninvolved in ETI-pilots in both flowers and bananas (Hurst et al. 2005). \n3.2 TARGETING BUYER POWER IN THE CUT FLOWER GVC \nThe world market for cut flowers has grown consistently since the early 1980s but has recently \nexperienced slower growth in demand at the same time as an expansion of production, especially \nin developing countries, has exerted downward pressure on prices. Furthermore, the global cut \nflower value chain is undergoing structural shifts in its EU distribution channels as supermarkets \nincreasingly source directly from suppliers in developing countries, thereby cutting out \nwholesalers and the Dutch auction system (CBI 2007; Thoen et al. 2000). The terrain for labour \nagency is structured by two different value chain strands (see Figure 2).  \nOn the one hand, the increase of direct sourcing by large retailers has a significant impact on \ngovernance. While retaining their driving role, due to their considerable buying power, \nsupermarkets externalise non core functions such as monitoring of quality and coordinating \nsupply logistics up the chain towards exporters. The best example of this is seen in Kenya where \nlarger growers have tailored their operations to sell directly to retail outlets in Europe through \noffering value-added production and supply chain management to supermarkets. This has been \n \n21 \nachieved through vertical integration down-stream into freight forwarding, clearance- and sales \nagency which has allowed Kenyan producers to control the distribution and marketing process \nmore effectively (Thoen et al. 2000). The Dutch auctions, on the other hand, basically function as \na distribution centre, absorbing large quantities of flowers that are re-packed and sold to buyers \nfrom all over the world. The system is based on three key components: the concentration of \nsupply, a public price discovery system, and a cooperative organization structure. There are seven \ncooperative flower auctions in the Netherlands with total sales amounting to \u20ac 2.5 billion in 2006 \n(CBI 2007). \nInsert Figure 2 about here. \nHistorically important, the Dutch flower auctions remain the most significant route and \nmechanism through which cut flowers from East Africa are distributed to European wholesalers \nand retailers (CBI 2007) even though direct sourcing by large retailers has increased. While the \ndirect strand for flowers is controlled by supermarket buyers, particularly UK retailers, and is \nstrongly buyer-driven, the auction system, in contrast, is less strictly coordinated and less driven. \nThe auction strand is characterised by relatively loose trading relationships because of a more \nmarket-based type of coordination, particularly at the auction point, which makes explicit \ngovernance along the whole chain difficult to achieve. It is in the direct GVC strand that labour \nhas been able to exploit the power of retailers in specifying entry barriers while campaigners in \nconsumer markets exposed and criticised the appalling working conditions in flower plantations \nin developing countries.  \nIn the last decade, a range of private social and environmental standards superseded ineffective \nunilateral corporate codes of conduct and developed into broader business and multi-stakeholder \ninitiatives. The majority of standards were developed in the European consumer markets, \n \n22 \nalthough recent years have also seen the initiation of a variety of standard initiatives in producer \ncountries. In all, at least 16 different social and or environmental standards (international and \nnational) exist for cut flower exports (CBI 2007; Dolan & Opondo 2005; Riisgaard 2009). In the \ncontext of very weak workplace organisation, it is the direct buyer-driven strand, rather than the \nspot market-based auction system, through which campaigners in the consumer markets as well \nas national and international trade union bodies have been able to create pressures for standards \nat the level of production. While a range of different PSSs are required to enter direct retailer \nchains, social and environmental standards are not currently a requirement to access the Dutch \nauctions, although an estimated 55% of flowers supplied to the auctions comply with the \nenvironmental certification scheme MPS with an optional social qualification MPS-SQ (some \ncommercial farms supply both the direct and the auction strand). However, an exception might \nbe emerging as flowers certified to the social and environmental label Fair Flowers Fair Plants \n(FFP) can now be identified at the auction clock on an optional basis (still, it is too early to assess \nthe impact of FFP, see also Riisgaard forthcoming). This became possible because it was in the \ninterest of the auctions and the wholesalers buying at the auctions to be able to offer socially \nlabelled flowers to buyers (previously not possible in the auction strand). The IUF used this \nopportunity to become part of and influence the FFP initiative.  \nUnions have engaged with PSSs at international, national and district, as well as farm branch \nlevel. In the context of national unions that were too weak to run organising campaigns and an \nemerging plethora of (mostly unilateral) standards, the IUF decided to enter the \u2018standards game\u2019, \n\u2013 on alternative terms \u2013 by challenging unilateral business codes of conduct (weak in content, \nscope and monitoring), engaging constructively in private standard setting and building its own \nmulti-stakeholder model standard, the International Code of Conduct for the Production of Cut \nFlowers (ICC; IFC 2002) (Interview with IUF Africa coordinator 2006).  This code was \n \n23 \nestablished by an alliance between the IUF, affiliates and several NGOs (the International Flower \nCampaign) and is based on ILO standards, with implementation mechanisms designed to include \nmeaningful participation of workers, local organisations and unions. The ICC formed the \ncentrepiece of a campaign to regulate work and employment in flower production. Initially, \nimporters in Germany and the Dutch MPS initiative were targeted, with success, to accept the \nICC (ILRF 2003) which later formed the basis for many of the social standard initiatives in the \ncut flower sector such as FLP, HEBI, Max Havelaar and MPS-SQ (Socially Qualified)5. A training \nmanual for shop stewards on how to use the ICC has been developed, and workshops have been \nheld for East African trade unions (on how to use the ICC to organise workers and improve their \nworking conditions). The latest development has been the introduction of the FFP scheme which \nis based on the ICC and coordinated by the largest international flower industry body, Union \nFleurs. According to the IUF, FFP is a step forward from other standards as it involves \nrepresentatives from local NGOs and trade unions as well as an auditor at all audits, thus \neffectively giving trade unions a veto on certification (Interview with IUF Geneva coordinator \n2008). Similar to the agreement between COLSIBA and Transfair in bananas, union participation \nin audits illustrates how unions are seeking to make actual freedom of association and the right of \ncollective bargaining an inherent element of PSSs. The account below demonstrates how the link \nbetween the global level and the workplace can be used to further labour organisation at \nproduction sites, depending however on the capacity and response of local unions.  \nUnionisation in the flower sector has increased considerably in Tanzania from two out of eight \nfarms in 1998 to six out of ten in 2006 (Interviews 2006; Riisgaard 2007). In Kenya unionisation \nhas remained relatively low with around 3,400 unionised flower workers (mainly male permanent \nworkers) out of approximately 50,000. To a major extent, the positive development in Tanzania \nhas come as a result of how labour has engaged with standards and managed to use them as a \n \n24 \nplatform to organise and build capacity at farm branch level.  This has occurred particularly \nthrough constructive interaction between FLP and the Plantation and Agricultural workers union \nof Tanzania (TPAWU), with FLP seeking union assurance that freedom of association and \ncollective bargaining rights are complied with before certifying farms. Ensuing organising \ninitiatives resulted in collective bargaining agreements on the two largest farms which, according \nto TPAWU, constituted the door opener to the flower sector in general (Interviews with \nTPAWU representatives; Riisgaard 2007). By contrast, the leadership of the Kenya Plantation and \nAgricultural Workers Union (KPAWU) has resisted the tripartite-plus logic of multi-stakeholder \nstandards and has been much more reticent in working with standards initiatives and labour-\nfriendly NGOs (see Riisgaard 2007 on the conflict between unions and NGOs). The KPAWU \nleadership does not allow links with PSS initiatives (which often work with non-KPAWU works \ncouncils on farms and do not routinely share inspection reports with the union) unless cleared \nwith the headquarter. Consequently KPAWU has declined to fill seats available on a local multi-\nstakeholder initiative and to shadow audits. An exception here is Max Havelaar which is \nperceived to look for compliance with ILO conventions and work more closely with unions \n(Interviews 2006).  \nThis has led to a dual engagement with PSSs in the Kenyan flower sector: on the one hand, \nbranch level KPAWU representatives are denied opportunities to shadow audits. Reflecting on \nthe good experience with Max Havelaar, one KPAWU branch secretary argued \nIt would be better for MPS-SQ to go straight to the branches. That would be the best way. \nBy not going we lose influence and personal disagreement comes in the way of worker \nrepresentation. Our job is to represent workers. (Interview 2006) \n \n25 \nOn the other hand, by remaining on the sidelines Kenyan unions have allowed labour NGOs to \nbecome the preferred local \u2018labour partner\u2019 and to shape more participatory auditing practices.  \n \n4. Discussion and Conclusion \nThe four cases discussed above reveal the difference chain governance makes for labour agency, \nnot only between but also within GVCs. However, the governance of inter-firm linkages, while \ncrucial in structuring the terrain for labour, is always mediated by the specific social relations of \nlocal production and labour control regimes as well as the histories and orientations of the \nrespective actors. GVCs shape labour\u2019s room for manoeuvre while labour co-constitutes GVCs. \nThis is apparent in the campaigns labour has engaged in for IFAs and PSSs which once again \nhighlights the role of the analytical factors discussed: (1) the level of drivenness; (2) the functional \nposition of the driver and the existence of a brand with consumer recognition; and (3) the \nspecificity of local labour control regimes and union organising.  \nFirst, social regulation along a GVC strand is more likely in highly-driven GVCs, regardless of the \nfunctional position of the lead-firms. High levels of drivenness point to the ability of the chain \ndriver to impose criteria (such as labour standards) on the rest of the value chain strand. Thus, \ndrivenness also opens avenues for labour (as well as other social movements) to target the \nstrategic actor(s), i.e. the driver(s), in the chain (see the direct strands in bananas and cut flowers). \nBy contrast, such leverage is more implausible where value chain strands are characterised by \nrelatively loose, market-based, trading relationships as evident in the banana wholesale strand and \nthe cut flower auction strand (although the emerging FFP label might constitute an exception). \n \n26 \nHere, no single actor has the power to control and impose conditions on the rest of the chain \nwhich deprives labour of a vehicle (a lead firm) under which fragmented labour actors could \ncooperate and campaign for social regulation.  \nSecond, where drivenness makes social regulation along the GVC plausible, the functional \nposition of the driver(s) creates different leverage points for labour. Whereas labour can threaten \nto disrupt production in producer-driven strands (where the MNC is vertically integrated and\/or \nexercises hands-on coordination over production), campaigns in buyer-driven strands threaten to \ndisrupt consumption. Additionally, there is a recognition of the central role of branded actors in \nhighly driven chains: in both the banana and flower cases the drivers\u2019 product or retail brands are \ntargeted although it is only in buyer-driven settings that labour typically depends on coalitions \nwith organisations at the consumer end. The bipolar nature of the direct banana strand allows \nleverage over both production and consumption: COLSIBA campaigned against a branded \nproducer with a relatively stable industrial and management structure (through vertical integration \nand hands-on management) and, as part of a broader coalition, targeted branded retailers to \ndemand socially certified bananas. Equally, retail drivers in the direct cut flower strand have been \npushed into demanding certification at production level; however, as they are not involved in \nproduction \u2013 either via vertical integration or hands-on coordination \u2013 it is the political power of \ncampaigners at the consumer end that is crucial here. Thus, the different ways in which \nproduction and consumption are linked through GVC governance frame labour\u2019s inter-\norganisational strategies. Whereas the challenge for labour in producer-driven chains lies in \nestablishing international cooperation between different production locations within the supply \nchain of an MNC, the challenge in buyer-driven chains lies in recreating a link between the \nsphere of consumption and the workplace in order to overcome the separation of workplaces \nfrom industrial and political power. In this context, linking production locations in IFAs is \n \n27 \nappropriate for labour to build counter power in producer driven chains, while PSSs seem more \nauspicious in linking broader coalitions across production and consumption. Thus, IFAs and \nPSSs serve different strategic purposes which might well be complementary but are not \ninterchangeable. Further strategic implications arise out of the trend towards buyer-drivenness in \nGVCs (see Gibbon & Ponte 2005, Gereffi et al. 2005) which arguably favours \u2018good targets\u2019 (i.e. \nconsumer brands) for labour campaigns. While this does not bode well for workers in chains that \nare not susceptible to consumer pressure, it only serves to further underline the need for broad \nlabour coalitions (with local communities, NGOs and Northern workers) as well as innovative \nstrategies beyond IFAs and PSSs.  \nThird, production and labour control regimes differ tremendously between the strands and \nlocations discussed; they are crucial in shaping the specific insertion of local production in the \nGVC as well as labour capacities to secure and maintain fundamental labour rights. In banana \nproduction, for example, labour managed to maintain its long-standing organisation at banana \nplantations in the face of wide-ranging, often government supported, anti-union campaigns and \nattacks (e.g. Korovkin 2005). Workplace strength and regional trade union coordination in the \nform of COLSIBA provided the foundation for strategies within the banana value chain which \nwas extended to Northern labour NGOs and consumer markets. Contrary to this, cut flower \nproduction in developing countries only took off in the 1980s and the 1990s, often coinciding \nwith liberalisation of host economies. Organising in emerging flower producer countries has \nproved extremely difficult and only been successful in few countries. Here, union strategies have \nbeen national and only gone beyond the national level through the IUF (often in collaboration \nwith Northern labour NGOs), creating generic minimum standards such as the ICC and \npressuring branded retailers in consumer markets. Thus, whereas the regional-global campaigns \nby COLSIBA and the IUF were backed up by workplace unionism, it was the IUF cooperation \n \n28 \nwith a variety of Northern (human rights, labour, environmental) NGOs that was of prime \nimportance for the labour rights campaigns in flower workplaces. It is important to recognise \nhow different forms of North-South linkages engage with the workplace: the regional-global \ncampaigns by COLSIBA and the IUF were firmly based on workplace unionism and could \ninfluence the direction of consumer-end pressure; conversely, in flowers it was initiatives and \ncampaigns from organisations in the North that established the conditions for workplace \norganisation in the South (the examples from Tanzania and Kenya show the difficulties of  \ntranslating rights into actual workplace capacity). The key role of labour\u2019s specific embeddedness \nfor its capacity to achieve sustainable workplace organisation is further underlined by a paradox \nthat has been noted following PSS campaigns: while demanding adherence to pro-labour \nstandards, demands made by retailers in the direct strand (such as just-in-time ordering) at the \nsame time exert pressure towards casual or temporary labour (Hughes 2001; Oxfam 2004; \nBarrientos & Smith 2007). This, we argue, underlines labour\u2019s role in co-constituting GVCs: to \ncounter the effects of this paradox, campaigns for PSSs need to be supported by a strategy of \nworkplace organising. While this has potential to effect redistribution between producers and \nworkers, it does not per se challenge the balance of power between different corporate actors in \nthe chain such as buyers and producers.  \nIn this paper we have argued that core concepts of GVC analysis and labour geography (Castree \net al. 2004; Herod 2001; Wills 2001) offer a useful starting point to elaborate on how GVC \ngovernance results in different opportunities and constraints for labour agency in relation to \nadvancing social regulation in different GVC terrains. In sum, our study shows how forms of \nGVC governance structure the way power is distributed along chains, and how, in reverse, labour \nmight use different strategies to shape value chains by using the power of lead firms for enforcing \nrights and transforming aspects of the employment relationship into entry barriers for \n \n29 \nparticipation in the chain. In order to exploit the potential of such an analysis labour needs to be \nconceptualized a priori as value producer in GVCs and thereby as a social actor with its own \ninterests regarding the organizational, spatial and political structure of a value chain.  \n \nReferences  \nBair, J.
