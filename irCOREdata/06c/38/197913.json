Such mission-oriented organizations are frequently staffed by\nmotivated agents who subscribe to the mission. This paper studies incentives in such\ncontexts and emphasizes the role of matching the mission preferences of principals\nand agents in increasing organizational efficiency. Matching economizes on the\nneed for high-powered incentives. It can also, however, entrench bureaucratic\nconservatism and resistance to innovations. The framework developed in this paper\nis applied to school competition, incentives in the public sector and in private\nnonprofits, and the interdependence of incentives and productivity between the\nprivate for-profit sector and the mission-oriented sector through occupational\nchoice. (JEL D23, D73, H41, L31)\nThe late twentieth century witnessed a his-\ntoric high in the march of market capitalism,\nwith unbridled optimism in the role of the profit\nmotive in promoting welfare in the production\nof private goods. Moreover, this generated a\nbroad consensus on the optimal organization of\nprivate good production through privately\nowned competitive firms. When it comes to the\nprovision of collective goods, no such consen-\nsus has emerged.1 Debates about the relative\nmerits of public and private provision still\ndominate.\nThis paper suggests a contracting approach to\nthe provision of collective goods. It focuses on\ntwo key issues: how to structure incentives, and\nthe role of competition between providers. At\nits heart is the idea that organizations that pro-\nvide collective goods cohere around a mission.2\nThus production of collective goods can be\nviewed as mission-oriented.\nOur approach cuts across the traditional\npublic-private divide. Not all activities within\nthe public sector are mission-oriented. For ex-\nample, in some countries, governments own car\nplants. While this is part of the public sector, the\noptimal organization design issues here are no\ndifferent from those faced by General Motors or\nFord. Not all private sector activity is profit-\noriented. Universities, whether public or pri-\nvate, have many goals at variance with profit\nmaximization. Our examples will draw from\nboth the public and the private sectors.\nThe missions pursued in the provision of\ncollective goods come from the underlying mo-\ntivations of the individuals (principals and\nagents) who work in the mission-oriented sec-\ntor. Workers are typically motivated agents, i.e.,\nagents who pursue goals because they perceive\nintrinsic benefits from doing so. There are many\nexamples\u2014doctors who are committed to sav-\ning lives, researchers to advancing knowledge,\njudges to promoting justice, and soldiers to de-\nfending their country in battle.

This label also includes a\ngood like education to which there is a commitment to\ncollective provision, even though the returns are mainly\nprivate.\n2 See, for example, James Q. Wilson (1989) on public\nbureaucracies and Robert M. Sheehan (1996) on nonprofits.\nJean Tirole (1994) is the first paper to explore the implica-\ntions of these ideas for incentive theory.\n616\nas mission-oriented makes sense when the out-\nput of the mission-oriented sector is thought of\nas producing collective goods. The benefits and\ncosts generated by mission-oriented production\norganizations are not fully reflected in the mar-\nket price. In addition, donating our income\nearned in the market to an organization that\npursues a mission that we care about is likely to\nbe an imperfect substitute for joining and work-\ning in it. This could be due to the presence of\nagency costs or because individuals care not\nonly about the levels of these collective goods,\nbut also about their personal involvement in\ntheir production (i.e., a \u201cwarm glow\u201d).\nIt is well known from the labor literature on\ncompensating differentials that employment\nchoices and wages depend on taste differences\n(Sherwin Rosen, 1986). This paper explores\nhow these economize on the need for explicit\nmonetary incentives while accentuating the im-\nportance of nonpecuniary aspects of organiza-\ntion design in increasing effort. Thus, mission\nchoice can affect the productivity of the orga-\nnization. For example, a school curriculum or\nmethod of discipline that is agreed to by the\nentire teaching faculty can raise school\nproductivity.\nMission preferences typically differ, how-\never, between motivated agents. Doctors may\nhave different views about the right way to treat\nill patients, and teachers may prefer to teach\ndifferent curriculums. This suggests a role for\norganizational diversity in promoting alterna-\ntive missions and competition between organi-\nzations in attracting motivated agents whose\nmission preferences best fit with one another.\nWe show that there is a direct link between such\nsorting and an organization\u2019s productivity.\nThe insights from the approach have applica-\ntions to a wide variety of organizations includ-\ning schools, hospitals, universities, and armies.\nIn this paper we abstract from the question of\npublic versus private ownership.3 The primi-\ntives are the production technology, the moti-\nvations of the actors, and the competitive\nenvironment. We also abstract (for the most\npart) from issues of financing.\nWe benchmark the behavior of the mission-\noriented part of the economy against a profit-\noriented sector where standard economic\nassumptions are made\u2014profit seeking and no\nnonpecuniary agent motivation. This is impor-\ntant for two reasons. First, we get a precise\ncontrast between the incentive structures of\nprofit-oriented and mission-oriented production.\nSecond, the analysis casts light on how changes\nin private sector productivity affect optimal\nincentive schemes operating in the mission-\noriented sector. This has implications for de-\nbates about how pay-setting in public sector\nbureaucracies responds to the private sector.\nOur approach yields useful insights into on-\ngoing debates about the organization of the\nmission-oriented sector of the economy. For\nexample, it offers new observations on the role\nof competition in enhancing productivity in\nschools. More generally, it suggests that one of\nthe main virtues of private nonprofit activity is\nthat it can generate a variety of different mis-\nsions which improve productivity by matching\nmanagers and workers who have similar mis-\nsion preferences. An analogous argument can\nbe made in support of decentralization of public\nservices. On the flip side, however, public bu-\nreaucracies, whose policies can be imposed by\npoliticians, may easily become demotivated in\nthe event of a regime change. Also, while\nmatching on mission preferences is potentially\nproductivity enhancing, it also leads to conser-\nvatism and can raise the cost of organizational\nchange.\nThis paper contributes to an emerging litera-\nture which studies incentive issues outside of\nthe standard private goods model.4 One strand\nputs weight on the multitasking aspects of non-\nprofit and government production along the\nlines of Bengt Holmstrom and Paul Milgrom\n(1991). Another emphasizes the career concern\naspects of bureaucracies (Mathias Dewatripont\net al., 1999; Alberto Alesina and Guido Tabel-\nlini, 2004). These two areas are brought to-\ngether in Daron Acemoglu et al. (2003).\nHowever, these all work with standard motiva-\ntional assumptions. This paper shares in com-\nmon with George Akerlof and Rachel Kranton\n(2005), Roland Benabou and Tirole (2003),\nJosse Delfgaauw and Robert Dur (2004), Avi-\nnash Dixit (2001), Patrick Francois (2000),\nKevin Murdock (2002), Canice Prendergast\n3 See Besley and Ghatak (2001) on the question of\noptimal ownership in the context of public goods. 4 See Dixit (2002) for a survey of this literature.\n617VOL. 95 NO. 3 BESLEY AND GHATAK: COMPETITION AND INCENTIVES WITH MOTIVATED AGENTS\n(2001), and Paul Seabright (2003) the notion\nthat nonpecuniary aspects of motivation mat-\nter.5 In common with Vincent Crawford and\nJoel Sobel (1982) and Philippe Aghion and Ti-\nrole (1997), our approach emphasizes how non-\ncongruence in organizational objectives can\nplay a role in incentive design. We explore,\nhowever, the role of matching principals and\nagents\u2014selection rather than incentives\u2014as a\nway to overcome this.6\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as\nfollows. In Section I, we lay out the basic model\nand study optimal contracts and the matching of\nprincipals and agents. Section II explores appli-\ncations of the model, and Section III concludes.\nI. The Model\nA. The Environment\nA \u201cfirm\u201d consists of a risk-neutral principal\nand a risk-neutral agent. The principal needs the\nagent to carry out a project. The project\u2019s out-\ncome (which can be interpreted as quality) can\nbe high or low: YH \u0001 1 (\u201chigh\u201d or \u201csuccess\u201d)\nand YL \u0001 0 (\u201clow\u201d or \u201cfailure\u201d). The probability\nof the high outcome is the effort supplied by the\nagent, e, at a cost c(e) \u0001 e2\/2. Effort is unob-\nservable and hence noncontractible. We assume\nthat the agent has no wealth and so cannot put in\na performance bond. Thus, a limited-liability\nconstraint operates, which implies that the agent\nhas to be given a minimum consumption level\nof w\u0001 \u0001 0 every period, irrespective of perfor-\nmance. Because of the limited-liability con-\nstraint, the moral hazard problem has bite. This\nis the only departure from the first-best in our\nmodel.\nWe assume that each principal has sufficient\nwealth so as not to face any binding wealth\nconstraints, and that the principal and agent\neach can obtain an autarchy payoff of zero.\nThe mapping from effort to outcome is the\nsame for all projects. We also assume that\nagents are identical in their ability to work on\nany type of project. Projects differ exclusively\nin terms of their missions. A \u201cmission\u201d consists\nof attributes of a project that make some prin-\ncipals and agents value its success over and\nabove any monetary income they receive in the\nprocess. This could be based on what the orga-\nnization does (charitable versus commercial),\nhow they do it (environment-friendly or not),\nwho the principal is (kind and caring versus\nstrict profit-maximizer) and so on. Allowing\nagents to have preferences over their work en-\nvironment follows a long tradition in labor eco-\nnomics (see, for example, Rosen, 1986).\nIn our basic model, missions are exogenously\ngiven attributes of a project associated with a\nparticular principal. In Section I C, we examine\nconsequences of endogenizing mission choice.\nThere are three types of principals and\nagents, labelled i \u0001 {0, 1, 2} and j \u0001 {0, 1, 2}.\nThe types of principals and agents are perfectly\nobservable. If the project is successful, a prin-\ncipal of type i receives a payoff of \u0002i \u0002 0. All\nprincipals receive 0 if a project is unsuccessful.\nPrincipals of type 0 have the same preferences\nas in the standard principal-agent model, i.e., \u00020\nis entirely monetary. However \u00021 and \u00022 may\nhave a nonpecuniary component. To focus ex-\nclusively on horizontal aspects of matching be-\ntween principals and agents, we assume that\n\u00021 \u0001 \u00022 \u0003 \u0002\u02c6.\n7\nSome agents care about the mission of the\norganization for which they work. Formally this\nimplies that the payoff of such agents depends\non their own type, and the type of the principal\nfor whom they work. Like principals, all agents\nare assumed to receive 0 if the project fails,\nirrespective of with whom they are matched.\nAgents of type 0 have standard pecuniary\nincentives\u2014their utility depends positively on\nmoney and negatively on effort. Since they are\nmotivated solely by money, they do not care\nintrinsically about which organization they\nwork for. In contrast, an agent of type 1 (type 2)\nreceives a nonpecuniary benefit of \u0003\u0002 from\n5 Some of these ideas consider the possibility that intrin-\nsic motivation can be affected by the use of explicit incen-\ntives (see also Richard Titmuss, 1970, and Bruno S. Frey,\n1997). We treat the level of intrinsic motivation as given.\n6 See Daniel Ackerberg and Maristella Botticini (2002),\nKaniska Dam and David Perez-Castrillo (2001), and\nEdward P. Lazear (2000) for approaches to principal agent\nproblems where sorting is important.\n7 We use the term horizontal matching to describe a\nsituation where there is no difference in the productivity of\norganizations when principals and agents are efficiently\nmatched. The standard vertical matching model looks at\nsituations where some principals and agents are more pro-\nductive regardless of whom they match with. We will briefly\nreturn to the implications of vertical sorting in Section II B.\n618 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW JUNE 2005\nproject success if he works for a principal of\ntype 1 (type 2), and \u0003 if matched with a princi-\npal of type 2 (type 1), where \u0003\u0002 \u0002 \u0003 \u0001 0.8\nThe payoff of an agent of type j who is\nmatched with a principal of type i when the\nproject succeeds can therefore be summarized\nas:\n\u0003ij \u0004 \u00010 i \u0004 0 and\/or j\u0004 0\u0003 i\u0001 \u00041, 2\u0005, j\u0001 \u00041, 2\u0005, i\u0005 j\n\u0003\u0002 i\u0001 \u00041, 2\u0005, j\u0001 \u00041, 2\u0005, i\u0004 j.\nWe will refer to the parameter \u0003ij as agent\nmotivation and agents of type 1 and 2 as moti-\nvated agents. We will refer to the economy as\nbeing divided into a mission-oriented sector\n(i.e., i \u0001 1, 2) and a profit-oriented sector (i.e.,\ni \u0001 0).\nWe make\nASSUMPTION 1:\nmax\u0004\u00020 , \u0002\u02c6 \u0006 \u0003\u0002\u0005\u0007 1.\nThis ensures that there is an interior solution for\neffort in all possible principal-agent matches.\nThe analysis of the model is in three steps.\nWe first solve for the optimal contract for an\nexogenously given match of a principal of type\ni and an agent of type j. Contracts between\nprincipals and agents have two components: a\nfixed wage wij , which is paid regardless of the\nproject outcome, and a bonus bij , which the\nagent receives if the outcome is YH. Initially, we\ntake the agent\u2019s reservation payoff u\u0002 j \u0001 0 to be\nexogenously given. Second, we consider the\nextension to endogenous missions which makes\n\u0003ij endogenous. Third, we study matching of\nprincipals and agents where the reservation pay-\noffs are endogenously determined.\nB. Optimal Contracts\nAs a benchmark, consider the first-best case\nwhere effort is contractible. This will result in\neffort being chosen to maximize the joint\npayoff of the principal and the agent. This\neffort level will depend on agent motivation\nand hence the principal-agent match. The\ncontract offered to the agent, however, plays\nno allocative role in this case.9 Thus, while\nmatching may raise efficiency, it has no im-\nplications for incentives in the first best. It is\nstraightforward to calculate that the first-best\neffort level in a principal-agent pair where the\nprincipal is type i and the agent is type j is\n\u0002i \u0006 \u0003ij . The expected joint surplus in this\ncase is 1\u20442 (\u0002i \u0006 \u0003ij)2.10\nIn the second best, effort is not contractible.\nThe principal\u2019s optimal contracting problem un-\nder moral hazard solves:\n(1) max\n\u0004bij ,wij\u0005\nu ij\np \u0004 \u0007\u0002i \b bij\beij \b wij\nsubject to:\n(a) The limited-liability constraint requiring\nthat the agent be left with at least w\u0001 :\n(2) bij \u0006 wij \u0001 w\u0001 , wij \u0001 w\u0001 ;\n(b) The participation constraint of the agent\nthat:\n(3) uija \u0004 eij \u0007bij \u0006 \u0003ij \b \u0006 wij \b 12 eij2 \u0001 u\u0002 j ;\n(c) The incentive-compatibility constraint, which\nstipulates that the effort level maximizes the\nagent\u2019s private payoff given (bij , wij):\neij \u0004 arg max\neij\u0001\t0,1\n\n\u0007eij\u0007bij\u0006 \u0003ij\b\u0006 wij\b 12 eij\n2\b.\nWe will restrict attention to the range of\nreservation payoffs for the agent in which the\nprincipal earns a nonnegative payoff. The\nincentive-compatibility constraint can be sim-\nplified to:\n8 These payoffs are contractible, unlike in Oliver D.\nHart and Holmstro\u00a8m (2002), where noncontractibility of\nprivate benefits plays an important role. Also, these are\nindependent of monetary incentives, which is contrary to\nthe assumption in the behavioral economics literature\n(see Frey, 1997).\n9 Any values of bij and wij such that the agent gets at least\nw\u0001 in all states of the world, and his expected payoff is at\nleast u\u0002 j, will work.\n10 The Pareto-frontier is a straight line with slope equal\nto minus one and intercepts on both axes equal to the joint\nsurplus.\n619VOL. 95 NO. 3 BESLEY AND GHATAK: COMPETITION AND INCENTIVES WITH MOTIVATED AGENTS\n(4) eij \u0004 bij \u0006 \u0003ij\nas long as eij \u0001 [0, 1].11\nLet v\u0002 ij be the value of the reservation payoff\nof an agent of type j, such that a principal of\ntype i makes zero expected profits under an\noptimal contract. Also, due to the presence of\nlimited liability, the participation constraint of\nthe agent may not bind if the reservation payoff\nis very low. Let vij denote the value of the\nreservation payoff such that for u\u0002 j \u0001 v ij , the\nagent\u2019s participation constraint binds. In the Ap-\npendix we show that v\u0002ij and v ij are positive real\nnumbers under our assumptions, and v ij \u000b v\u0002ij.12\nA further assumption is needed to guarantee\nthe existence of optimal contracts under moral\nhazard. In particular, the payoff from project\nsuccess to the principal and\/or the agent must be\nhigh enough to offset the agency costs due to\nmoral hazard, and must ensure both parties re-\nceive nonnegative payoffs. The following as-\nsumption provides a sufficient condition for this\nto be true for any principal-agent match:\nASSUMPTION 2:\n1\n4 \tmin\u0004\u00020 , \u0002\u02c6\u0005\n\n2 \b w\u0001 \t 0.\nThe following proposition characterizes the\noptimal contract. All proofs are presented in the\nAppendix.\nPROPOSITION 1: Suppose Assumptions 1 and\n2 hold. An optimal contract (b*ij , w*ij) between a\nprincipal of type i and an agent of type j given\na reservation payoff u\u0002 j \u0001 [0, v\u0002 ij] exists, and has\nthe following features:\n(a) The fixed wage is set at the subsistence\nlevel, i.e., w*ij \u0001 w\u0001 ;\n(b) The bonus payment is characterized by\nb*ij \u0004 \u0001max\u00010, \u0002i \b \u0003ij2 \u0002 if u\u0002 j\u0001 \t0, v ij\n\u00032\u0007u\u0002 j \b w\u0001 \b\b \u0003ij if u\u0002 j\u0001 \tv ij , v\u0002 ij\n;\n(c) The optimal effort level solves: e*ij \u0001 b*ij \u0006 \u0003ij.\nThe first part of the proposition shows that\nthe fixed wage payment is set as low as possi-\nble. Other than the agent\u2019s minimum consump-\ntion constraint, the agent is risk neutral and does\nnot care about the spread between his income in\nthe two states. Hence, the principal will want to\nmake the fixed wage as small as possible.\nThe second part characterizes the optimal\nbonus payment and the third part characterizes\noptimal effort, which follows directly from the\nincentive-compatibility constraint. Limited lia-\nbility implies that the principal cannot induce\nthe first-best level of effort in the presence of\nmoral hazard.13 In choosing b the principal\nfaces a trade-off between providing incentives\nto the agent (setting b higher) and transferring\nsurplus from the agent to himself (setting b\nlower). Accordingly, the reservation payoff of\nthe agent plays an important role in determining\nb, and the higher the reservation payoff, the\nhigher is b.\nAnother important parameter is the motiva-\ntion of the agent. For the same level of b, an\nagent with greater motivation will supply higher\neffort. From the principal\u2019s point of view, b is a\ncostly instrument of eliciting effort. Since agent\nmotivation is a perfect substitute for b, moti-\nvated agents receive lower incentive pay at the\noptimum. The various possibilities can be clas-\nsified in three cases that depend on the value of\nthe reservation payoff, and whether the agent\nvalues project success more than the principal:\nCase 1: If the agent is more motivated than the\nprincipal and the outside option is low, then\nb*ij \u0001 0, i.e., there should optimally be no in-\ncentive pay.\n11 This will be the case under the optimal contract. The\nbonus payment bij will never optimally set to be greater than or\nequal to the principal\u2019s payoff from success \u0002i because then\nthe principal will be receiving a negative expected payoff.\nTherefore, by Assumption 1, eij \u000b 1. Also, it is never optimal\nto offer a negative bonus to the agent. The limited-liability\nconstraint requires that bij \u0006 wij \u0001 w\u0001 and so is feasible only if\nwij\u0002 w\u0001 . But by increasing bij and decreasing wij while keeping\nthe agent\u2019s utility constant, effort will go up and the principal\nwould be better off. Therefore, eij \u0002 0.\n12 We also show that v\u0002 ij is less than the joint surplus\nunder the first-best, which is what one would expect in the\npresence of agency costs.\n13 Making the agent a full residual claimant (i.e., bij \u0001\n\u0002i) will elicit the first-best effort level, but the principal\u2019s\nexpected profits will be negative, making this an unattrac-\ntive option for him.\n620 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW JUNE 2005\nCase 2: If the principal is more motivated than\nthe agent and the outside option is low, then\nb*ij \u0004 12 \u0007\u0002i \b \u0003ij \b.\nIn this case, the principal sets incentive pay\nequal to half the difference in the principal\u2019s\nand agent\u2019s valuation of the project.\nCase 3: If the outside option is high then\nb*ij \u0004 \u00032\u0007u\u0002 j \b w\u0001 \b \b \u0003ij .\nThe optimal incentive pay, in this case, is set\nby the outside market with a discount depend-\ning in size on the agent\u2019s motivation.\nThe third part of the proposition characterizes\noptimal effort, which depends on the sum of the\nagent\u2019s motivation and the bonus payment. In\nthe first case, the principal relies solely on agent\nmotivation, while in the second and third cases,\nadditional incentives in the form of bonus pay-\nments are provided. In Case 3, the effort level is\nentirely determined by the outside option.\nWe now offer three corollaries of this prop-\nosition, which are useful in understanding its\nimplications for incentive design. The first de-\nscribes what happens in the profit-oriented\nsector:\nCOROLLARY 1: In the profit-oriented sector\n(i \u0001 0), the optimal contract is characterized by\nthe following:\n(a) The fixed wage is set at the subsistence\nlevel, i.e., w*0j \u0001 w\u0001 ( j \u0001 0, 1, 2);\n(b) The bonus payment is characterized by\nb*0j \u0004 \u0001\u000202 if u\u0002 j\u0001 \t0, v 0j\n\u0003 2\u0007u\u0002 j \b w\u0001 \b if u\u0002 j\u0001 \tv 0j , v\u00020j\n\nfor j \u0001 0, 1, 2;\n(c) The optimal effort level solves: e*0j \u0001 b*0j\n( j \u0001 0, 1, 2).\nThis follows directly from the fact that \u00030j \u0001\n0 for j \u0001 0, 1, 2. Notice that Case 1 above is no\nlonger a possibility\u2014the agent in the profit-\noriented sector must always be offered incentive\npay to put in effort.\nThe next two corollaries regard the mission-\noriented sector and illustrate the importance of\nmatching principals and agents.\nCOROLLARY 2: Suppose that u\u00020 \u0001 u\u00021 \u0001 u\u00022.\nThen, in the mission-oriented sector (i \u0001 1, 2),\neffort is higher and the bonus payment lower if\nthe agent\u2019s type is the same as that of the\nprincipal.\nTo see this, observe from part (b) of Prop-\nosition 1 that the bonus paid to the agent is\ndecreasing in his motivation, and is zero if\nthe agent is at least as motivated as the prin-\ncipal. Moreover, the bonus is higher if i dif-\nfers from j. The observation that effort is\nhigher combines parts (b) and (c) of Proposi-\ntion 1. Hence, organizations with \u201cwell-\nmatched\u201d principals and agents will have\nhigher levels of productivity, other things be-\ning the same (in particular, assuming that\nreservation payoffs of agents are the same for\nall types).\nCOROLLARY 3: Suppose that u\u00020 \u0001 u\u00021 \u0001 u\u00022.\nThen, in the mission-oriented sector (i \u0001 1, 2)\nbonus payments and effort are negatively cor-\nrelated in a cross section of organizations.\nThis follows directly from Corollary 2.\nThus, holding constant the reservation pay-\noffs of agents (u\u0002 j), productivity (i.e., optimal\neffort) and incentive pay will be (weakly)\nnegatively correlated across organizations.\nThis result, which appears surprising at first\nglance, is capturing a pure selection effect.\nHolding the characteristics of the principals\nand the agent constant, greater incentive pay\ndoes lead to higher effort and higher produc-\ntivity, as in the standard principal-agent\nmodel. However, the heterogeneity among or-\nganizations in the mission-oriented sector is\ndriven partly by the preferences of the agents,\nwhich affect both effort and incentive\npayments.\nThese two corollaries are useful in demon-\nstrating the costs of poor matching of princi-\npals and agents in a world where there are\nmotivated agents. In Section I D, we show\nhow endogenous matching of principal-agent\npairs and endogenous determination of the\nagents\u2019 reservation payoffs can increase\nefficiency.\n621VOL. 95 NO. 3 BESLEY AND GHATAK: COMPETITION AND INCENTIVES WITH MOTIVATED AGENTS\nC. Endogenous Motivation\nIn this section, we discuss how our frame-\nwork can be extended to make the motivation of\nagents endogenous by allowing the principal to\npick the mission of the organization.14 Suppose\nthat both the principal and the agent in the\nmission-oriented sector care about the mission.\nLet the mission be denoted by x, which is a real\nnumber in the unit interval X \u0001 [0, 1]. For the\nsake of concreteness, x could be a school cur-\nriculum with 0 denoting secular education and 1\ndenoting a high degree of religious orientation.\nLet the nonpecuniary benefits of the principal\nand the agent conditional on project success be\naffected by the mission choice. Formally, let\ngi(x) and hj(x) denote the payoff of a principal\nof type i and an agent of type j (i \u0001 1, 2 and j \u0001\n1, 2) when the mission choice is x \u0001 X. The\nbasic model can be thought of as a case in which\nthe mission is not contractible and is picked by\nthe principal after he hires an agent. In this case\nx*i \u0004 arg max\nx\u0001X\n\u0004gi\u0007x\b\u0005,\nwhich is independent of the agent\u2019s type.15\nIf the mission choice is contractible, how-\never, then it might be optimal for the principal\nto use the mission choice to incentivize the\nagent, either by picking a \u201ccompromise\u201d mis-\nsion somewhere between the principal\u2019s and\nagent\u2019s preferred outcomes or even picking the\nagent\u2019s preferred mission. A full treatment of\nthis is beyond the scope of this paper. However,\nto illustrate the issues involved, we provide a\nsimple example. Consider Case 2 of Proposi-\ntion 1. Suppose that gi(x) \u0001 P \f 1\u20442 (x \f \ni)2\nand hj(x) \u0001 A \f 1\u20442 (x \f \nj)2 where \ni \u0001 X and\n\nj \u0001 X are the \u201cideal\u201d missions of principals of\ntype i and agents of type j, and P \u0002 A. Recall\nthat in this case, the agent is given a bonus\npayment of 1\u20442 (\u0002i \f \u0003ij) and the optimal effort\nlevel is e*ij \u0001 1\u20442 (\u0002i \u0006 \u0003ij). The principal\u2019s\nexpected payoff in this case is e*ij(\u0002i \f b*ij) \f w\u0001\n\u0001 1\u20444 (\u0003ij \u0006 \u0002i)2 \f w\u0001 . The optimal mission, if\ncontractible, will therefore solve:\nx*ij \u0004 arg max\nx\u0001X\n1\n4 \u0004g\ni\u0007x\b\u0006 hj\u0007x\b\u00052.\nIt is straightforward to show that the optimal\nmission choice is given by x*ij \u0001 (\nj \u0006 \ni)\/2.16\nThis compromise mission increases \u0003ij rela-\ntive to the case where the principal picks his\nideal mission of \ni. Thus compromising on the\nmission will reduce the need for incentive pay,\ni.e., b*ij will be lower. However, overall effort\n(and hence the productivity of the organization)\nwill be greater. This illustrates how, absent per-\nfect matching, mission choice can be manipu-\nlated to raise agent motivation and is a\nsubstitute for financial motivation.\nWe assume that full contractibility or non-\ncontractibility of the mission are the two ex-\ntreme cases. In reality, mission choice is likely\nto be subject to incentive problems and a key\naspect of organization design aims to influence\nmission choice. In ongoing work, we study how\nchoosing nonprofit status or giving agents dis-\ncretion in mission-setting could be viewed as\nmechanisms through which a principal precom-\nmits not to choose missions that may be viewed\nnegatively by agents. Although the mission can\n\u201cbridge the gap\u201d between the principal and\nagent, it is no substitute for having them agree\non the mission in the first place. In the next\nsection, we explore how this comes about\nthrough matching.\nD. Competition\nA key feature of our model is that the types of\nprincipals and agents affect organizational effi-\n14 Endogenous motivation or mission preference could\nbe the result of \u201csocialization\u201d of agents by principals (see\nAkerlof and Kranton, 2005).\n15 Thus, \u0003\u0002 \u0001 hj(x*j), \u0003 \u0001 hj(x*i) for i \u0001 1, 2, j \u0001 1, 2, and\ni \r j.\n16 Without loss of generality, suppose \ni \u0002 \nj. Observe\nthat a value of x that exceeds \ni or is less than \nj will never\nbe chosen since it is dominated by choosing x \u0001 \ni or x \u0001\n\nj. The problem in this case is to choose x to maximize\n1\u20444 (gi(x) \u0006 hj(x))2 subject to the constraint gi(x) \u0001 hj\n(x) (which is one of the conditions that characterizes case 2\nof Proposition 1). Notice that gi(x) \u0006 hj(x) is a concave\nfunction which attains its global maximum at (\ni \u0006 \nj)\/2.\nThe first derivative of (gi(x) \u0006 hj(x))2 is 2(gi(x) \u0006 hj(x))\n(dgi(x)\/dx \u0006 dhj(x)\/dx). The unique critical point of\n1\u20444 (gi(x) \u0006 hj(x))2 is therefore (\ni \u0006 \nj)\/2. Notice that the\nderivative is strictly positive for all x \u0001 [\nj, (\ni \u0006 \nj )\/2)\nand strictly negative for all x \u0001 ((\ni \u0006 \nj)\/2, \ni]. Therefore,\nthe function (gi(x) \u0006 hj(x))2 and affine transformations of it\nare pseudo-concave, and so the function attains a global\nmaximum at x \u0001 (\ni \u0006 \nj)\/2 (see Carl P. Simon and\nLawrence Blume, 1994, pp. 527\u201328). As P \u0002 A, the con-\nstraint gi(x) \u0001 h j (x) is satisfied at x \u0001 (\ni \u0006 \nj )\/2.\n622 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW JUNE 2005\nciency. In this section, we consider what hap-\npens when the different sectors compete for\nagents reverting to the case where the mission is\nexogenous.17 We study this without modeling\nthe competitive process explicitly, focusing in-\nstead on the implications of stable matching.\nWe look for allocations of principals and agents\nthat are immune to a deviation in which any\nprincipal and agent can negotiate a contract that\nmakes both of them strictly better off. Were this\nnot the case, we would expect rematching to\noccur.\nFirst, we need to introduce some additional\nnotation. Let Ap \u0001 {p0, p1, p2} denote the set\nof types of principals and letAa \u0001 {a0, a1, a2}\ndenote the set of types of agents. Following\nAlvin E. Roth and Marilda Sotomayor (1989),\nthe matching process can be summarized by a\none-to-one matching function \u000b :Ap \u0002Aa3Ap \u0002Aa such that (a) \u000b(pi) \u0001Aa \u0002 {pi} for\nall pi \u0001Ap; (b) \u000b(aj) \u0001Ap \u0002 {aj} for all aj \u0001Aa; and (c) \u000b(pi) \u0001 aj if and only if \u000b(aj) \u0001 pi\nfor all (pi, aj) \u0001Ap \u000eAa. A principal (agent)\nis unmatched if \u000b(pi) \u0001 pi (\u000b(aj) \u0001 aj). This\nfunction simply assigns each principal (agent)\nto at most one agent (principal) and allows for\nthe possibility that a principal (agent) remains\nunmatched, in which case he is described as\n\u201cmatched to himself.\u201d\nLet nip and nja denote the number of principals\nof type i and the number of agents of type j in\nthe population. We assume that n1a \u0001 n1p and\nn2\na \u0001 n2\np to simplify the analysis. However, the\npopulation of principals and agents of type 0\nneed not be balanced\u2014we consider both unem-\nployment, i.e., n0a \u0002 n0p, and full employment,\ni.e., n0a \u000b n0p. We assume that a person on the\n\u201clong-side\u201d of the market gets none of the sur-\nplus which pins down the equilibrium reserva-\ntion payoff of all types of agents.18\nFrom the analysis in the previous section, for\na given value of u\u0002 j, we can uniquely character-\nize the optimal contract between a principal of\ntype i and an agent of type j. We begin by\nshowing that any stable matching must have\nagents matched with principals of the same\ntype. This is stated as:\nPROPOSITION 2: Consider a matching \u000b and\nassociated optimal contracts (w*ij , b*ij) for i \u0001 0,\n1, 2 and j \u0001 0, 1, 2. Then this matching is stable\nonly if \u000b(pi) \u0001 ai for i \u0001 0, 1, 2.\nThis result says that all stable matches must\nhave principals and agents matched assorta-\ntively. This argument is a consequence of the\nfact that, for any fixed set of reservation pay-\noffs, an assortatively matched principal agent\npair can always generate more surplus than one\nwhere the principal and agent are of different\ntypes.19\nThis result allows us to focus on assortative\nmatching. The next two results characterize the\ncontracts and the optimal effort levels in two\ncases\u2014full-employment and unemployment in\nthe profit-oriented sector.\nIn the full employment case, principals com-\npete for scarce agents with the latter capturing\nall of the surplus. This sets a floor on the payoff\nthat a motivated agent can be paid. Whether the\nparticipation constraint is binding now depends\non how \u00020 compares with \u0003ij and \u0002\u02c6. Let\n\f \u0004 max\u0004\u0003\u0002 , \u0002\u02c6\u0005\u0006 \u0003\u0002 .\nWe assume that when the mission-oriented and\nprofit-oriented sectors compete for agents, then\nmission-oriented production is viable:\nASSUMPTION 3:\n\u0003\u0002 \u0006 \u0002\u02c6 \u0001 \u00020 .\nThe following proposition characterizes the\noptimal contracts and optimal effort levels\nunder the stable matching in the full-\nemployment case:\nPROPOSITION 3: Suppose that n0a \u000b n0p ( full\nemployment in the profit-oriented sector). Then\nthe following matching \u000b is stable: \u000b(aj) \u0001 pjfor j \u0001 0, 1, 2 and the associated optimal\ncontracts have the following features:\n17 It would be straightforward to extend the model to\nincorporate matching with endogenous missions.\n18 For the case n0a \u0001 n0p there is a range of possible values\nof the reservation payoff.\n19 This requires a nonstandard matching argument be-\ncause of our focus on horizontal sorting. Recent results on\nassortative matching in nontransferable utility environments\nby Patrick Legros and Andrew F. Newman (2003) cannot be\napplied in our setting.\n623VOL. 95 NO. 3 BESLEY AND GHATAK: COMPETITION AND INCENTIVES WITH MOTIVATED AGENTS\n(a) The fixed wage is set at the subsistence\nlevel, i.e., w*jj \u0001 w\u0001 for j \u0001 0, 1, 2;\n(b) The bonus payment in the mission-oriented\nsector is:\nb*11 \u0004 b*22 \u0004 12 max\u0004\f, \u00020 \u0006 \u0003\u000202 \b 4w\u0001 \u0005\b \u0003\u0002\nand the bonus payment in the profit-\noriented sector is:\nb*00 \u0004\n\u00020 \u0006 \u0003\u000202 \b 4w\u0001\n2 ;\n(c) The optimal effort level solves: e*jj \u0001 b*jj \u0006\n\u0003\u0002 for j \u0001 1, 2 and e*00 \u0001 b*00.\nThe proposition illustrates how competition\nand incentives interact. There are two effects.\nFirst, there is a matching effect. This reduces the\ndegree of heterogeneity in contracts observed in\nthe mission-oriented sector relative to the case\nwhere principals and agents are non-assortatively\nmatched. This also raises organizational pro-\nductivity, which follows using the logic of Cor-\nollary 2 given assortative matching. If the\nparticipation constraint is not binding, then this\nis achieved with concomitant reductions in in-\ncentive pay.20 In our setup, all agents in the\nmission-oriented sector receive the same incen-\ntive payment in equilibrium and are equally\nproductive.\nSecond, there is an outside option effect.\nCompetition among principals pins down the\nequilibrium value of the outside option. With\nfull employment in the profit-oriented sector,\nthe expected payoff of profit-oriented principals\nis driven to zero, with agents capturing all the\nsurplus from profit-oriented production. The\nreservation utility of a motivated agent is set by\nwhat he could obtain by switching to the profit-\noriented sector. A sufficiently productive profit-\noriented sector (\u00020 \u0006 \u000f\u000202 \f 4w \u0002 \f) leads to\na binding participation constraint and a mission-\noriented sector that uses more incentive pay. Thus\nthe outside option effect can also raise productiv-\nity, but by increasing incentive pay of agents.\nProposition 3 also gives a sense of when\nincentives will be less high-powered in mission-\noriented production with motivated agents.\nEven if the participation constraint binds, the\nlevel of incentive pay in the mission-oriented\nsector is less than in the private sector by an\namount \u0003\u0002 . Without the participation constraint\nbinding, incentive pay in the mission-oriented\nsector is zero if \u0003\u0002 \u0002 \u0002\u02c6, which also implies that\nincentives are more high powered in the profit-\noriented sector.21\nWe now consider what happens if there is\nunemployment in the profit-oriented sector and\nprofit-oriented principals are able to extract all\nthe surplus from this agent (at least in so far as\nthe limited-liability constraint permits). The\nsupply price of motivated agents is now deter-\nmined by their unemployment payoff. The fol-\nlowing proposition characterizes this case:\nPROPOSITION 4: Suppose that n0a \u0002 n0p (un-\nemployment in the profit-oriented sector). Then\nthe following matching \u000b is stable: \u000b(aj) \u0001 pjfor j \u0001 0, 1, 2 and the associated optimal\ncontracts have the following features:\n(a) The fixed wage is set at the subsistence\nlevel, i.e., w*jj \u0001 w\u0001 for j \u0001 0, 1, 2;\n(b) The bonus payment in the mission-oriented\nsector is:\nb*11 \u0004 b*22 \u0004\n\f\n2 \b \u0003\n\u0002\nand the bonus payment in the profit-\noriented sector is:\nb*00 \u0004\n\u00020\n2 ;\n(c) The optimal effort level solves: e*jj \u0001 b*jj \u0006\n\u0003\u0002 for j \u0001 1, 2 and e*00 \u0001 b*00.\nThe effect of competition on incentives now\nacts purely through the matching effect. The\npresence of unemployment unhinges incentives\nin the mission-oriented and profit-oriented sec-\ntors of the economy since the only outside op-\n20 Matching can improve productivity even under the\nfirst-best. The analysis of the second-best offers insights on\nthe effect of matching on the pattern of incentive pay.\n21 It is possible to have more high-powered incentives in\nthe mission-oriented sector, but only if the participation\nconstraint is not binding, and \u0002\u02c6 is high relative to \u00020 and \u0003\u0002 .\n624 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW JUNE 2005\ntion is being unemployed. Principals earn\npositive profits, and employed agents in both\nsectors earn a rent relative to the unemployed in\nthis case.\nContrasting the results in Proposition 1 with\nthose in Propositions 3 and 4 yields interesting\ninsights into the role of competition in the\nmission-oriented sector, and its role in changing\nthe pattern of incentive pay and in improving\nproductivity. The results in this subsection cor-\nrespond to an idealized situation of frictionless\nmatching. They provide a benchmark for what\ncan be achieved in a decentralized economy and\nhow matching can raise productivity and affect\nthe structure of incentive pay.\nII. Applications\nThe benchmark for our analysis is the case\nwhere principals and agents are matched and\nallocated by endogenously determined reserva-\ntion payoffs, as illustrated in Section I D. Even\nin a world of motivated agents, however, there\nmay be frictions that prevent this idealized out-\ncome from being attained. These comprise such\nnatural frictions as search costs and asymmetric\ninformation. There may also be \u201cartificial\u201d fric-\ntions due to government policies. A number of\ngovernment policies in recent years have leaned\ntoward reducing these artificial barriers to a\ncompetitive, decentralized system of collective\nservice provision.22 These may involve reforms\nwithin the public sector or initiatives to foster\ngreater involvement of the nonprofit sector in\nservice provision. The model developed here is\nwell placed to think through the implications of\nsuch developments.\nIn this section, we discuss three main con-\ntexts in which the ideas apply. We begin with a\ndiscussion of nonprofit organizations. We then\ndiscuss how the provision of education in\nschools might fit the model. Finally, we discuss\npublic bureaucracies.\nA. Nonprofit Organizations\nThe notion of a mission-oriented organiza-\ntion staffed by motivated agents corresponds\nwell to many accounts of nonprofit organiza-\ntions. The model emphasizes why those who\ncare about a particular cause are likely to end up\nas employees in mission-oriented nonprofits.\nThis finds support in Burton A. Weisbrod\n(1988), who observes, \u201cNon-profit organiza-\ntions may act differently from private firms not\nonly because of the constraint on distributing\nprofit but also, perhaps, because the motivations\nand goals of managers and directors ... differ. If\nsome non-profits attract managers whose goals\nare different from those managers in the propri-\netary sector, the two types of organizations will\nbehave differently\u201d (page 31). He also observes,\n\u201cManagers will ... sort themselves, each gravi-\ntating to the types of organizations that he or she\nfinds least restrictive\u2014most compatible with\nhis or her personal preferences\u201d (page 32).23\nWeisbrod also cites persuasive evidence to\nsupport the idea that such sorting is important in\npractice in the nonprofit sector. The notion of a\nmission-oriented organization is, however,\nsomewhat more far-reaching than that of a non-\nprofit. For example, such sorting can be very\nimportant in such \u201csocially responsible\u201d for-\nprofit firms as the Body Shop.24\nHow exactly nonprofit status facilitates\ngreater sorting on missions raises interesting\nissues. If the organization can contract over the\nmission up front, as in Section I C, then it\nshould make no difference whether there is a\nformal nonprofit constitution. Thus, as argued\nby Edward Glaeser and Andrei Shleifer (2001),\nadopting nonprofit status must have its roots in\ncontracting imperfections. This would be rele-\nvant if the principal has some incentive to act\nopportunistically ex post in a way that diverts\nthe mission from what the agent would like.\nThis would make it difficult to recruit motivated\nagents or \u201cdemotivate\u201d those already in the or-\nganization to the extent that opportunism is not\nanticipated. The possibility of such \u201cmission\ndrift\u201d would also speak in favor of having\na board of trustees that will safeguard the\n22 These are sometimes known as quasi-market reforms\n(see, for example, Julian Le Grand and Will Bartlett, 1993).\n23 See Glaeser (2002) for a model of nonprofits where\nworkers and managers of nonprofits have something like\nour mission-preferences, i.e., caring directly about the out-\nput of the firm.\n24 On the Web site of the Body Shop, their \u201cvalues\u201d are\ndescribed as follows: \u201cWe consider testing products or\ningredients on animals to be morally and scientifically in-\ndefensible\u201d; and \u201cWe believe that a business has the respon-\nsibility to protect the environment in which it operates,\nlocally and globally\u201d (see http:\/\/www.thebodyshop.com\/).\n625VOL. 95 NO. 3 BESLEY AND GHATAK: COMPETITION AND INCENTIVES WITH MOTIVATED AGENTS\nmission. It also shows the importance of having\na motivated principal, i.e., someone who is ded-\nicated to the mission, running the\norganization.25\nEmpirical studies suggest that in industries\nwhere both for-profits and nonprofits are in op-\neration, such as hospitals, the former sector\nmakes significantly higher use of performance-\nbased bonus compensation relative to base sal-\nary for managers (Jeffrey P. Ballou and\nWeisbrod, 2003; Richard J. Arnould et al.,\n2000). It is recognized in the literature that\nmanagers may care about the outputs produced\nby the hospital or the patient. Researchers are\nunable, however, to explain this empirical find-\ning. In the words of Ballou and Weisbrod\n(2003), \u201cWhile the compensating differentials\nmay explain why levels of compensation differ\nacross organizational forms, it does not explain\nthe differentials in the use of strong relative to\nweak incentives.\u201d Our framework provides a\nsimple explanation for this finding.\nIn addition, Arnould et al. (2000) find that the\nspread of managed care in the United States,\nwhich increases market competition, has in-\nduced significant changes in the behavior of\nnonprofit hospitals. In particular, they find that\nthe relationship between economic performance\nand top managerial pay in nonprofit hospitals\nstrengthens with increases in HMO penetration.\nIn terms of our model, this can be explained as\nthe effect of an increase in the profitability of\nthe for-profit sector (\u00020) which tightens the\nparticipation constraints of the managers.\nOur framework also underlines the value of\ndiversity in the nonprofit sector, provided there\nis a variety of views on the way in which\ncollective goods should be produced (as repre-\nsented by the mission preferences). Weisbrod\n(1988) emphasizes this role of nonprofit orga-\nnizations in achieving diversity. For example,\nhe observes that nonprofits likely play a more\nimportant role in situations where there is\ngreater underlying diversity in preferences for\ncollective goods. He contrasts the United States\nand Japan, suggesting that greater cultural het-\nerogeneity is partly responsible for the greater\nimportance of nonprofit activity in the United\nStates. Our analysis of the role of competition in\nsorting principals and agents on mission prefer-\nences underpins the role of diversity in achiev-\ning efficiency. Better matched organizations can\nresult in higher effort and output. Hence, diver-\nsity is good not only for the standard reason,\nnamely, consumers get more choice, but also in\nenhancing productive efficiency.\nNonprofit organizations rely on heteroge-\nneous sources of finance\u2014a mixture of private\ndonors, government grants, and endowments.\nThe analysis so far has abstracted from such\nissues by assuming that the principal has a\nsource of wealth. Hence, the analysis best fits\norganizations that are endowment-rich. But\ngiven the importance of external finance in\npractice, it is interesting to think through the\nimplications of introducing a third group of\nactors\u2014donors\u2014who contribute to the organi-\nzation.26 We would expect donors, like agents,\nto pick organizations on the basis of the mis-\nsions they pursue. When such matching is per-\nfect, the existence of outside financiers raises no\nnew issues.\nThe more interesting case arises when donors\nhave mission preferences that differ from those\nof any matched principal-agent pair in the econ-\nomy. They can then seek to influence organiza-\ntions by offering a donation that is conditional\non changing the mission of the organization.\nBut our analysis suggests that externally en-\nforced mission changes come at a cost, since the\nagent (and possibly the principal) will become\ndemotivated and the organization will become\nless productive.27 This leads us to conjecture\nthat endowment finance will generally be asso-\nciated with higher levels of productivity in the\nnonprofit sector.\nThe role of the donor can also give some\ninsight into the difference between public and\nprivate finance. In publicly funded organiza-\ntions, the government plays the role of a donor.\nIt can use this role to influence mission choice.\nWe would expect its mission preferences to be\ndetermined either by electoral concerns or con-\nstitutional restrictions (e.g., maintaining a neu-\ntral stance with respect to religious issues). The\ngovernment may be able to provide financial\n25 This suggests that promotion of insiders may be im-\nportant in such organizations as a way of preserving the\nmission.\n26 See Glaeser (2002) for a related attempt to consider\nthe role of donors in the governance of nonprofits.\n27 Formally, both \u0002i and \u0003ii will be lower.\n626 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW JUNE 2005\nsupport to some private organizations, but if it\ndoes so, it might distort their missions toward\nits preferred style of provision. In so doing, it\ncan reduce productivity, since agents will be\nless motivated as a consequence. Indeed, when\nU.S. President George W. Bush announced the\npolicy of federal support for faith-based pro-\ngrams in 2001, some conservatives expressed\nconcern that involvement with the government\nwill undermine the independence of churches,\nand this might have a demoralizing effect.28\nThus, we would expect government-funded or-\nganizations, on average, to be less efficient than\nthose privately financed through endowments.\nHowever, whether they are more or less produc-\ntive than those funded by private donations is\nless clear, given the earlier discussion.\nB. Education Providers\nEducation providers are a key example of\nmotivated agents, regardless of whether pub-\nlicly or privately owned. The approach devel-\noped here provides some useful insights into the\nrole of competition and incentives in improving\nschool performance.29 Moreover, the model\nworks equally well when thinking about pub-\nlicly and privately owned schools without in-\nvoking the implausible assumption that the\nlatter are profit-maximizing.\nSome schooling policies, specifically those\nrestricting diversity in mission choice, have\nserved to prevent the kind of decentralized out-\ncome studied in Propositions 3 and 4. However,\nrecent policies to encourage entry and compe-\ntition between schools may allow schools to\nemerge with more distinctive missions. For ex-\nample, in the United Kingdom, Prime Minister\nTony Blair has been emphasizing the impor-\ntance of diversity in his education policy. In the\nUnited States, initiatives to encourage charter\nschools are based on the idea of creating schools\nthat cater to community needs. The competitive\noutcome that we characterize can be thought of\nas the outcome from an idealized system of\ndecentralized schooling in which schools com-\npete by picking different missions and attracting\nteachers who are most motivated to teach ac-\ncording to those missions.\nTo think through these issues formally, con-\nsider the model of mission choice introduced in\nSection I C. For simplicity, we will focus on the\nallocation of a balanced population of teachers\n(agents) to schools taking the outside option in\nthe profit-oriented sector as given. In this con-\ntext, a mission could be a curriculum or a\nmethod of teaching.\nAt one extreme is a centralized world where\nschools are forced to adopt homogeneous mis-\nsions as a matter of government policy. Suppose\nthat this mission is x \u0001 (\n1 \u0006 \n2)\/2, which is\nset between the preferred missions of the two\ntypes of principals and agents. Even if princi-\npals and agents match on the basis of mission\npreferences, there is no improvement in school\nproductivity, as principals\u2019 and agents\u2019 payoffs\ndepend on x, which is fixed exogenously.\nNow suppose that the government offers\nschools the freedom to set their own missions. It\ncould do so by allowing new schools to enter or\nby allowing existing schools to change their\nmissions and to compete for teachers on the\nbasis of their mission preferences. Applying the\nlogic of Proposition 2, we now have schools\nwith missions \n1 and \n2 , with principals and\nagents matched on the basis of their mission\npreferences.\nThe model predicts that this form of compe-\ntition will yield increases in school productivity\nin all schools\u2014all agents and principals will\nhave higher levels of motivation than when\nmissions are homogeneous.30 Thus, theoreti-\ncally at least, school competition of this form is\n\u201ca rising tide that lifts all boats,\u201d to use Hoxby\u2019s\n28 See \u201cLeap of Faith\u201d by Jacob Weisberg, February 1,\n2001, Slate (http:\/\/www.slate.msn.com).\n29 As Caroline M. Hoxby (2003) points out, while the\nempirical literature suggests that there are productivity dif-\nferences across schools and that competition may affect\nthese, there has been relatively little theoretical work on\ndeterminants of school productivity. Hoxby (1999) is a key\nexception. She models the impact of competition in a model\nwhere there are rents in the market for schools, and argues\nthat a Tiebout-like mechanism may increase school produc-\ntivity. Other approaches to the issue, such as Dennis Epple\nand Richard Romano (2002), have emphasized peer-group\neffects (i.e., school quality depends on the quality of the\nmean student) but as far as \u201csupply side\u201d factors are con-\ncerned they assume that some schools are more productive\nthan others for exogenous reasons. Akerlof and Kranton\n(2002) provide important insights into the economics of\neducation using ideas from sociology.\n30 This result holds true whether or not the outside option\nbinds, as long as it remains fixed exogenously by the profit-\noriented sector and is the same for all motivated agents.\n627VOL. 95 NO. 3 BESLEY AND GHATAK: COMPETITION AND INCENTIVES WITH MOTIVATED AGENTS\n(2002) phrase. The model also provides an al-\nternative explanation for why some schools\n(such as Catholic schools) can be more produc-\ntive by attracting teachers whose mission pref-\nerences are closely aligned with those of the\nschool management.\nThe general point is that a decentralized\nschooling system where missions are developed\nat the school level will tend to be more produc-\ntive (as measured in our model by equilibrium\neffort) than a centralized one in which a uniform\nmission is imposed on schools by govern-\nment.31 This is true regardless of whether we\nare talking about public or private schools.32\nAllowing more competition through mission\nchoice reallocates teachers across schools and\nimproves efficiency while reducing the need for\nincentive pay. Thus, our approach shows that\ncompetition between schools can have effects\non productivity without creating a need for in-\ncentive pay.33\nA general concern with school competition is\nthat sorting leads to inequality. This would hap-\npen in our model if there were vertical rather\nthat horizontal differentiation between the prin-\ncipals and agents. Specifically, suppose that\nsome agents have high \u0003, no matter what prin-\ncipal they are matched with, and that some\nprincipals have high \u0002, regardless of the agent\nthey match with. In this case, it is possible to\nshow that, in a stable matching, high \u0003 agents\nwill be matched with high \u0002 principals.34 Ap-\nplied to schools, this predicts segregation of\nschools by quality.35 However, centralizing\nmission choice is not a solution to this problem\nunless certain kinds of mission preferences and\nlevels of motivation happen to be correlated.\nRather, the solution will lie in creating incen-\ntives for highly motivated teachers to work with\nless motivated principals.\nC. Incentives in Public Sector Bureaucracies\nOur model can also cast light on more general\nissues in the design of incentives in public bu-\nreaucracies. Disquiet about traditional modes of\nbureaucratic organization has led to a variety of\npolicy initiatives to improve public sector pro-\nductivity. The so-called New Public Manage-\nment emphasizes the need to incentivize public\nbureaucracies and to empower consumers of\npublic services.36 Relatedly, David Osborne and\nTed Gaebler (1993) describe a new model of\npublic administration emphasizing the scope for\ndynamism and entrepreneurship in the public\nsector. Our framework suggests an intellectual\nunderpinning for these approaches. By focus-\ning, however, on mission orientation, which is\nalso a central theme of Wilson (1989), we em-\nphasize the fundamental differences between\nincentive issues in the public sector and those\nthat arise in standard private organizations.\nThe results developed here give some insight\ninto how to offer incentives for bureaucrats\nwhen there is a competitive labor market. Our\nframework implies that public sector incentives\nare likely to be more low powered because it\nspecializes in mission-oriented production. It\ntherefore complements existing explanations,\n31 The approach offered here is distinct from existing\ntheoretical links competition and productivity in the context\nof schools. For example, yardstick competition has been\nused extensively in the United Kingdom where \u201cleague\ntables\u201d are used to compare school performance. Whether\nsuch competition is welfare improving in the context of\nschools is moot since the theoretical case for yardstick\ncomparisons is suspect when the incentives in organizations\nare vague or implicit, as in the case of schools (see, for\nexample, Dewatripont et al., 1999). Another possible para-\ndigm for welfare-improving school competition rests on the\npossibility that it can increase the threat of liquidation with\na positive effect on teacher effort (Klaus M. Schmidt, 1997).\nThis possibility could easily be incorporated into our model\nas a force that increases the cost to the agent (in this case a\nteacher) of the outcome where the output is YL.\n32 Arguably our model offers an excessively rosy view of\ncompetition. Missions may be driven by ideological, reli-\ngious, or political concerns, some of which may not con-\ntribute to the social good. With horizontally differentiated\nschools, society could also end up being fragmented, mak-\ning it more difficult to solve collective action problems. In\na more realistic world of multidimensional missions, the\nissue for school policy will be which aspect of the mission\nto decentralize.\n33 This holds if the outside option is fixed. However, if\nschool competition raises the outside options of teachers,\nthen it could lead to more use of incentive pay. For a review\nof recent debates about incentive pay for teachers, see Eric\nA. Hanushek (2002).\n34 This is the more standard result from the matching\nliterature. Since we have nontransferable utility (due to\nlimited liability), we can use the insights from Legros and\nNewman (2003).\n35 This differs from the standard model of school segre-\ngation based on peer group effects in production. See, for\nexample, Epple and Romano (2002).\n36 See Michael Barzelay (2001) for background\ndiscussion.\n628 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW JUNE 2005\nbased on multitasking and multiple principals,\nof why we would expect public sector incen-\ntives to be lower powered than private sector\nincentives (Dixit, 2002). It provides a particu-\nlarly clean demonstration of this, as the produc-\ntion technology is assumed to be identical in all\nsectors.\nIn a public bureaucracy, we might think of\nthe principal\u2019s type being chosen by an electoral\nprocess. The productivity of the bureaucracy\nwill change endogenously if there is a change in\nthe mission due to the principal being replaced,\nunless there is immediate \u201crematching.\u201d This\nprovides a possible underpinning for the diffi-\nculty in reorganizing public sector bureaucra-\ncies and a decline in morale during the process\nof transition. Over time, as the matching process\nadjusts to the new mission, this effect can be\nundone, and so we might expect the short- and\nlong-run responses to change to be rather dif-\nferent. As Wilson (1989, p. 64) remarks, in the\ncontext of resistance to change in bureaucracies\nby incumbent employees, \u201c... one strategy for\nchanging an organization is to induce it to re-\ncruit a professional cadre whose values are con-\ngenial to those desiring the change.\u201d This\nsuggests a potentially efficiency-enhancing role\nfor politicized bureaucracies where the agents\nchange with changes in political preferences.\nThe approach also gives some insight into\nhow changes in private sector productivity ne-\ncessitate changes in public sector incentives.\nConsider, as a benchmark, the competitive out-\ncome in Proposition 3. Changes in productivity\nthat affect both sectors in the same way will\nhave a neutral effect. However, unbalanced pro-\nductivity changes that affect one sector may\nhave implications only for optimal contracts. To\nsee this, consider an exogenous increase in \u00020.\nIn a situation of full employment as described in\nProposition 3, even if public employees initially\nreceive a rent above their outside option, the\nparticipation constraint will eventually bind.\nThe model predicts that this will lead to greater\nuse of high-powered incentives in the public\nsector.37\nPutting together insights from Propositions 3\nand 4, we can shed some light on why the\narguments of the New Public Management to\npromote incentives in the public sector became\npopular, as they did in countries like New Zea-\nland and the United Kingdom in the 1980s.\nThere were two components. First, the United\nKingdom experienced a fall in motivation\namong principals and agents in the public sector\nunder Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher due to\nher efforts to change the mission of public sec-\ntor bureaucracies. Since this was done in the\ntime of high unemployment, as Proposition 4\npredicts, there was little consequence for public\nsector incentives. However, in the 1990s, there\nwas a return to full employment and a rise in\nprivate sector wages\u2014raising \u00020 in terms of our\nmodel. This, as Proposition 4 predicts, caused\nthe public sector to consider schemes that\nmimic private sector incentives.\nThe model can also cast light on another\ncomponent of the New Public Management\u2014\nattempts to empower beneficiaries of public\nprograms. Examples include attempts to involve\nparents in the decision-making process of\nschools, and patients in that of the public health\nsystem. This is based on the view that public\norganizations work better when members of\ntheir client groups get representation and can\nhelp shape the mission of the organization. The\nmodel developed here suggests that this works\nwell, provided that teachers and parents share\nsimilar education goals. Otherwise, attempts by\nparents to intervene will simply increase mis-\nsion conflict, which can reduce the efficiency of\norganizations.\nOne key issue that frequently arises in dis-\ncussions of incentives in bureaucracies is cor-\nruption. By attenuating the property rights of\nthe principal, corruption can motivate the agent\nand may have superficial similarities with our\nmodel here. But there are two key differences:\ncorruption is purely pecuniary and it is not\n\u201cvalue creating.\u201d38 The insights developed here\n37 In the unemployment case described in Proposition 4,\nprivate sector productivity does not affect public sector\nproductivity. Hence, we would expect issues concerning the\ninteraction between public and private pay to arise predom-\ninantly in tight labor markets.\n38 Our framework can capture the differences formally if\nwe suppose that \u0002i \u0001 Bi \f R and \u0003ij \u0001 \u000bR where R is the\namount that an agent of type j \u201csteals\u201d from a principal of\ntype i. (The cost of stealing is parametrized by \u000b \r 1.)\nAssuming for simplicity that the agent\u2019s outside option is\nzero, the optimal contract (applying Proposition 1) is now:\n\u0007b*ij , w*ij \b \u0004 \u0005Bi \b \u00071 \u0006 \u000b\bR2 , w\u0001 \u0006 .\n629VOL. 95 NO. 3 BESLEY AND GHATAK: COMPETITION AND INCENTIVES WITH MOTIVATED AGENTS\nare quite distinct from incentive problems due\nto corruption.\nA common complaint about public bureau-\ncracies is that they are conservative and resist\ninnovation.39 Our model can make sense of this\nidea. In a profit-oriented organization, any\nchange that increases the principal\u2019s payoff, \u00020 ,\nwill be adopted. However, in a mission-oriented\norganization, the preferences of the agent need\nalso be taken into account. Consider, for the\nsake of illustration, Case 2 of Proposition 2. The\nprincipal\u2019s expected payoff in this instance is\ne*ij(\u0002i \f b*ij) \f w\u0001 \u0001 1\u20444 (\u0003ij \u0006 \u0002i)2 \f w\u0001 . Since a\nmission-oriented organization will innovate\nonly if \u0002i \u0006 \u0003ij is larger, it is optimal for the\nprincipal to factor in the effect that it has on the\nmotivation of the agent. If innovations reduce\n\u0003ij , they might be resisted even if \u0002i is higher. If\nwe think of \u0002i as predominantly a financial\npayoff, then innovations that pass standard fi-\nnancial criteria for being worthwhile (raising\n\u0002i) may be resisted in mission-oriented sectors\nof the economy. Since much of the drive for\nefficiency in the public sector uses financial\naccounting measures, this could explain why\npublic bureaucracies are often seen as conser-\nvative and resistant to change.\nIII. Concluding Remarks\nThe aim of this paper has been to explore\ncompetition and incentives in mission-oriented\nproduction. These ideas are relevant in discus-\nsion of organizations where agents have some\nnonpecuniary interest in the organization\u2019s suc-\ncess. Key examples are nonprofits, public bu-\nreaucracies, and education providers. With\nmotivated agents, there is less need for incen-\ntive pay. There is also a premium on matching\nof mission preferences.\nMuch remains to be done to understand the\nissues better. It is particularly important to un-\nderstand how the existence of motivated agents\naffects the choice of organizational form. The\nanalysis also cries out for a more complete\ntreatment of the sources of motivation and the\npossibility that motivation is crowded in or out\nby actions that the principal can take.40\nIn this paper, we have maintained a sharp\ndistinction between mission-oriented and profit-\noriented sectors. However, private firms fre-\nquently adopt missions. In future work, it would\nbe interesting to develop the content of mission\nchoice in more detail and to understand how\nmission choice interacts with governance of or-\nganizations and market pressures.\nAPPENDIX\nTo prove Proposition 1, we proceed by prov-\ning several useful lemmas. Substituting for eij\nusing the incentive-compatibility constraint, we\ncan rewrite the optimal contracting problem in\nSection I B as:\nmax\n\u0004bij ,wij\u0005\nu ij\np \u0004 \u0007\u0002i \b bij\b\u0007bij \u0006 \u0003ij\b\b wij\nsubject to the limited-liability and participation\nconstraints:\nwij \u0001 w\u0001\nuij\na \u0004\n1\n2 \u0007bij \u0006 \u0003ij \b\n2 \u0006 wij \u0001 u\u0002 j .\nThis modified optimization problem involves\ntwo choice variables, bij and wij , and two con-\nstraints, the limited-liability constraint and the\nparticipation constraint. The objective function\nu ij\np is concave and the constraints are convex.\nNow we are ready to prove:\nLEMMA 1: Under an optimal incentive con-\ntract, at least one of the participation and the\nlimited-liability constraints will bind.\nPROOF:\nSuppose both constraints do not bind.

Also, the productivity of the\norganization is decreasing in R in this case.\n39 The ensuing argument could equally be applied to\nreligious organizations, advocacy groups, and nongovern-\nmental organizations, which are often accused of being rigid\nin their views and approaches.\n40 Frey (1997), Benabou and Tirole (2003), and Ak-\nerlof and Kranton (2003) make important progress in this\ndirection.\n630 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW JUNE 2005\ncipal can simply maximize his payoff with re-\nspect to bij , which yields\nbij \u0004 max\u0001\u0002i \b \u0003ij2 , 0\u0002\nand the corresponding effort level is\neij \u0004 bij \u0006 \u0003ij \u0004 max\u0001\u0002i \u0006 \u0003ij2 , \u0003ij\u0002.\nSince the participation constraint is not binding,\nand by assumption wij \u0002 w\u0001 , the principal can\nreduce wij by a small amount without violating\neither of these constraints. This will not affect\neij , and yet will increase his profits. This is a\ncontradiction and so the principal will reduce\nwij until either the limited-liability constraint or\nthe participation constraint binds.\nLEMMA 2: Under an optimal incentive contract\nif the limited-liability constraint does not bind,\nthen (a) eij is at the first-best level; and (b) the\nprincipal\u2019s expected payoff is strictly negative.\nPROOF:\nWe prove the equivalent statement, namely,\nif eij is not at the first-best level then the limited-\nliability constraint must bind. As b \r \u0002i, effort\ncannot exceed the first-best level. The remain-\ning possibility is that eij is less than the first-best\nlevel. Suppose this is the case, i.e., eij \u0001 bij \u0006\n\u0003ij \u000b \u0002i \u0006 \u0003ij. We claim that in this case the\nlimited-liability constraint must bind. Suppose\nit does not bind. That is, we have an optimal\ncontract (bij0, wij0) such that bij0 \u000b \u0002i and wij0 \u0002 w\u0001 .\nSuppose we reduce wij0 by \u000e and increase bij0 by\nan amount such that the agent\u2019s expected payoff\nis unchanged. Since the agent chooses effort to\nmaximize his own payoff, we can use the en-\nvelope theorem to ignore the effects of changes\nin wij and bij on his payoff via eij. Then duija \u0001\neij dbij \u0006 dwij \u0001 0. The effect of these changes\non principal\u2019s payoff is duijp \u0001 deij(\u0002i \f bij) \f\n(eij dbij \u0006 dwij). The second term is zero by\nconstruction and the first term is positive and so\nthe principal is better off. This is a contradic-\ntion. This proves the first part of the lemma.\nNext we show that if the limited-liability con-\nstraint does not bind, then the principal\u2019s ex-\npected payoff is strictly negative. From the first\npart of this lemma, if the limited-liability con-\nstraint does not bind, then eij \u0001 \u0002i \u0006 \u0003ij. From\nthe incentive-compatibility constraint, this im-\nplies bij \u0001 \u0002i. Since wij \u0002 w\u0001 (the limited-\nliability constraint does not bind) and w\u0001 \u0001 0,\nthis immediately implies that the principal\u2019s\nexpected payoff uijp \u0001 \fwij \u000b 0.\nLEMMA 3: Suppose Assumption 2 holds. Then\nv\u0002 ij is a strictly positive real number that does\nnot exceed Sij.\nPROOF:\nBy Lemma 2, if the principal\u2019s expected pay-\noff is nonnegative, then the limited-liability\nconstraint must bind. Therefore, wij \u0001 w\u0001 . Given\nthe modified version of the optimal contracting\nproblem stated at the beginning of this section,\nthe only remaining variable to solve for is bij.\nThe agents payoff is increasing in bij. Therefore\nwe can solve for bij from the equation (\u0002i \f\nbij)(bij \u0006 \u0003ij) \f w\u0001 \u0001 0 (the principal\u2019s expected\npayoff is equal to 0). Being a quadratic equation\nit has two roots, but the higher one is the rele-\nvant one since the agent\u2019s payoff is increasing\nin bij. This is:\nbij \u0004\n\u0002i \b \u0003ij \u0006 \u0003\u0007\u0002i \u0006 \u0003ij \b2 \b 4w\u0001\n2 .\nSubstituting this into the agent\u2019s payoff func-\ntion, we get\nv\u0002 ij \u0004\n1\n2 \u0005\u0003ij \u0006 \u0002i \u0006 \u0003\u0007\u0003ij \u0006 \u0002i \b2 \b 4w\u00012 \u0006\n2\n\u0006 w\u0001 .\nBy Assumption 2, (\u0003ij \u0006 \u0002i)2 \f 4w\u0001 \u0002 0 for\nall i \u0001 0, 1, 2 and all j \u0001 0, 1, 2. Therefore,\nv\u0002 ij is a real number. It is strictly positive as\n\u0002i \u0002 0 and \u0003ij \u0002 0. Also, as w\u0001 \u0001 0, v\u0002 ij \r Sij\n(the equality holds if w\u0001 \u0001 0).\nLEMMA 4: Suppose Assumption 2 holds. Then\nv ij lies in the real interval (0, v\u0002 ij).\nPROOF:\nSuppose the participation constraint does not\nbind.

This is a positive\nreal number as \u0002i \u0002 0 and \u0003ij \u0002 0. There are\ntwo cases, depending on whether \u0002i is greater\nthan or less than \u0003ij. In the former case it is clear\nupon inspection that vij \u000b v\u0002 ij. In the latter case,\nwe need to show that \u0003ij \u0006 \u0002i \u0006\n(\u000f(\u0003ij \u0006 \u0002i)2 \f 4w\u0001 )\/2 \u0002 \u0003ij.

In the present\ncase, by assumption \u0003ij \u0002 \u0002i. Therefore \u0002i\u0003ij \u0002\n\u0002i\n2 \u0002 1\u20444\u0002i2 and so this condition holds given\nAssumption 2.\nPROOF OF PROPOSITION 1:\nNow we are ready to characterize the opti-\nmal contract and prove its existence. By\nLemma 1 and Lemma 2, the only relevant\ncases are the following: (a) the limited-\nliability constraint binds but the participation\nconstraint does not bind; and (b) both the\nparticipation constraint and the limited-\nliability constraint bind. From the proof of\nLemma 4, the former case can be usefully\nsplit into two separate cases depending on\nwhether \u0002i is greater than or less than \u0003ij.\nThis means there are three cases to study:\nCase 1: The participation constraint does not\nbind and \u0003ij \u0002 \u0002i. We have already estab-\nlished in the proof of Lemma 1 that in this\ncase the limited-liability constraint will bind\nand that:\nb*ij \u0004 max\u0001\u0002i \b \u0003ij2 , 0\u0002\u0004 0\nw*ij \u0004 w\u0001\ne*ij \u0004 b*ij \u0006 \u0003ij \u0004 \u0003ij .\nFrom Lemma 4, the agent\u2019s payoff is 1\u20442 \u0003ij2 \u0006 w\u0001 .\nSince the participation constraint does not bind\nby assumption in this case, the following must\nbe true:\n1\n2 \u0003ij\n2 \t u\u0002 j \b w\u0001 .\nThe principal\u2019s payoff is\n\u0007b*ij \u0006 \u0003ij \b\u0007\u0002i \b b*ij \b \b w\u0001 \u0004 \u0003ij\u0002i \b w\u0001 .\nCase 2: The participation constraint does not\nbind and \u0003ij \r \u0002i. In this case:\nb*ij \u0004 max\u0001\u0002i \b \u0003ij2 , 0\u0002\u0004\u0002i \b \u0003ij2\nw*ij\u0004 w\u0001\ne*ij\u0004 b*ij\u0006 \u0003ij\u0004\n\u0002i\u0006 \u0003ij\n2\n.\nThe agent\u2019s payoff is 1\u20448 (\u0002i \u0006 \u0003ij)2 \u0006 w\u0001 in this\ncase. Since the participation constraint does not\nbind by assumption in this case, the following\nmust be true:\n1\n8 \u0007\u0002i \u0006 \u0003ij \b\n2 \t u\u0002 j \b w\u0001 .\nThe principal\u2019s payoff is\n\u0007b*ij \u0006 \u0003ij \b\u0007\u0002i \b b*ij \b \b w\u0001 \u0004 14 \u0007\u0002i \u0006 \u0003ij \b\n2 \b w\u0001 .\nCase 3: The participation constraint and the\nlimited-liability constraint bind. These con-\nstraints then uniquely pin down the two choice\nvariables for the principal. In particular, we get\nw*ij \u0004 w\u0001\nb*ij \u0004 \u00032\u0007u\u0002 j \b w\u0001 \b \b \u0003ij .\nUsing these and the incentive-compatibility\nconstraint, we get\ne*ij \u0004 b*ij \u0006 \u0003ij \u0004 \u00032\u0007u\u0002 j \b w\u0001 \b.\nAs b*ij \r \u0002i , e*ij \u0001 \u000f2(u\u0002 j \f w\u0001 ) \r \u0002i \u0006 \u0003ij.\nTherefore, u\u0002 j \f w\u0001 \r 1\u20442 (\u0002i \u0006 \u0003ij)2. Notice\nthat in this case b*ij \u0002 0 as that is equivalent\nto u\u0002 j \f w\u0001 \u0002 1\u20442 \u0003ij2 and this must be true\nbecause otherwise the participation constraint\nwould not bind. The payoff of the agent in\nthis case is, by assumption,\nuij\na \u0004 u\u0002 j .\nThe principal\u2019s payoff is:\nuij\np \u0004 \u00032\u0007u\u0002 j \b w\u0001 \b\u0007\u0002i \u0006 \u0003ij \b \u00032\u0007u\u0002 j \b w\u0001 \b\b \b w\u0001 .\n632 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW JUNE 2005\nFrom the proof of Lemma 3, this is equal to\nzero if u\u0002 j \u0001 v\u0002 ij. Therefore, so long as u\u0002 j \r\nv\u0002 ij , uij\np \u0001 0.\nFinally, we must check that the optimal con-\ntract exists. The principal\u2019s expected payoff\nwhen u\u0002 j \u0001 0 and \u0003ij \u0001 \u0002i is \u0003ij\u0002i \f w\u0001 . By\nAssumption 2 this is positive for i \u0001 1, 2 and\nj \u0001 1, 2. The principal\u2019s expected payoff when\nu\u0002 j \u0001 0 and \u0003ij \u000b \u0002i is 1\u20444 (\u0002i \u0006 \u0003ij)2 \f w\u0001 . By\nAssumption 2 this is positive. In both cases the\nagent receives a strictly positive expected pay-\noff even though u\u0002 j \u0001 0. In the first case, the\nagent\u2019s expected payoff is 1\u20442 \u0003ij2 \u0006 w\u0001 and in the\nsecond case it is 1\u20448 (\u0002i \u0006 \u0003ij)2 \u0006 w\u0001 , which are\nstrictly positive real numbers by Lemma 4. On\nthe other extreme, if the principal\u2019s expected\npayoff is set to zero, the agent\u2019s expected payoff\nunder the optimal contract is v\u0002 ij , which is a\nstrictly positive real number by Lemma 3. For\nall u\u0002 j \u0001 vij , the participation constraint binds\nand the principal\u2019s expected payoff is a contin-\nuous and decreasing function of u\u0002 j, and so an\noptimal contract exists for all u\u0002 j \u0001 [0, v\u0002 ij].\nPROOF OF PROPOSITION 2:\nLet zj be the reservation payoff of an agent of\ntype j ( j \u0001 0, 1, 2). Then from the proof of\nProposition 1 the expected payoff of a principal\nof type i (i \u0001 0, 1, 2) when matched with an\nagent of type j ( j \u0001 0, 1, 2) is given by:\n\u0010*ij \u0007 zj \b \u0004 \u0007\n\u0002i\u0003ij \b w\u0001\nfor \u0002i \u0007 \u0003ij\nand zj \b w\u0001 \u0007\n1\n2 \u0003ij\n2\n\u0007\u0002i \u0006 \u0003ij\b\n2\n4 \b w\u0001\nfor \u0002i \u0001 \u0003ij\nand zj \b w\u0001 \u0007\n1\n8 \u0007\u0002i \u0006 \u0003ij\b\n2\n\u00032\u0007zj \b w\u0001 \b\u0007\u0002i \u0006 \u0003ij \b \u00032\u0007zj \b w\u0001 \b\b\b w\u0001\nfor\n1\n8 \u0007\u0002i \u0006 \u0003ij\b\n2 \r zj \b w\u0001 \r v\u0002 ij\na\n.\nFrom the proof of Proposition 1, \u0010*ij(zj) is\n(weakly) decreasing in zj for all i \u0001 0, 1, 2 and\nall j \u0001 0, 1, 2. First consider principals in the\nmission-oriented sector. As \u00021 \u0001 \u00022 \u0001 \u0002\u02c6, for\nany given value of z0 \u0001 z1 \u0001 z2 \u0001 z, \u0010*ii(z) \u0002\n\u0010*ij(z) for i \u0001 1, 2, for j \u0001 0, 1, 2, and i \r j.\nNext consider principals in the profit-oriented\nsector. For any given value of z0 \u0001 z1 \u0001 z2 \u0001 z,\n\u0010*00(z) \u0001 \u0010*01(z) \u0001 \u0010*02(z). We now demon-\nstrate that all stable matches must be\nassortative.\nSuppose that there is a stable nonassorta-\ntive match with reservation payoffs ( z0, z1,\nz2). Since n1a \u0001 n1p and n2a \u0001 n2p, there must be\nat least one match involving a principal of\ntype i (i \u0001 1, 2) and an agent of type j \r i\n( j \u0001 0, 1, 2). We show that this leads to a\ncontradiction.\nOf the various possibilities, we can eliminate\nimmediately the one where a principal of type i\n(i \u0001 1, 2) is matched with an agent of type j \r\ni ( j \u0001 0, 1, 2) and, correspondingly, an agent of\ntype i is unmatched. Such an agent receives the\nautarchy payoff of 0 and so a principal of type\ni (i \u0001 1, 2) cannot possibly prefer to hire an\nagent of type j \r i as \u0010*ii(0) \u0002\u0010*ij(zj) for all i \u0001\n1, 2, for all j \r i, and zj \u0001 0. Given this, there\nare three types of nonassortative matches that\nwe need to consider.\nFirst, a principal of type i (i \u0001 1, 2) is\nmatched with an agent of type 0 and, corre-\nspondingly, an agent of type i is matched with\na principal of type 0. Stability implies a prin-\ncipal of type i would not wish to bid away an\nagent of type i from a principal of type 0. This\nimplies \u0010*i0( z0) \u0001 \u0010*ii( zi) which in turn im-\nplies that zi \u0002 z0 as \u0010*ii( z0) \u0002 \u0010*i0( z0).\nSimilarly, the fact that a principal of type 0\nprefers to hire an agent of type i (i \u0001 1, 2)\nover an agent of type 0 implies that \u0010*0i( zi) \u0001\n\u0010*00( z0), which in turn implies z0 \u0001 zi. But\nthat is a contradiction.\nSecond, a principal of type 1 is matched with\nan agent of type 2 and, correspondingly, an\nagent of type 1 is matched with a principal of\ntype 2. By stability a principal of type 1 would\nnot wish to bid away an agent of type 1 from a\nprincipal of type 2. This implies \u0010*12(z2) \u0001\n\u0010*11(z1), which in turn implies that z1 \u0002 z2 since\n\u0010*11(z2) \u0002 \u0010*12(z2). Similarly, the fact that a\ntype 2 principal does not want to bid away a\ntype 2 agent implies that \u0010*21(z1) \u0001 \u0010*22(z2).\nBut by a similar argument this implies that z2 \u0002\nz1. This is a contradiction.\nThird, a principal of type i (i \u0001 1, 2) is\nmatched with an agent of type 0, an agent of\ntype i is matched with a principal of type j \r i\n( j \u0001 1, 2), and an agent of type j is matched\nwith a principal of type 0. Repeating the argu-\nments used above, the fact that a principal of\ntype i (i \u0001 1, 2) prefers an agent of type 0 to an\n633VOL. 95 NO. 3 BESLEY AND GHATAK: COMPETITION AND INCENTIVES WITH MOTIVATED AGENTS\nagent of type i implies zi \u0002 z0. Similarly, as a\nprincipal of type j\r i ( j\u0001 1, 2) prefers an agent\nof type i to an agent of type j implies zj \u0002 zi.\nTogether, these two inequalities imply zj \u0002 z0.\nHowever, the fact that a principal of type 0\n(weakly) prefers to hire an agent of type j to an\nagent of type 0 implies z0 \u0001 zj, which is a\ncontradiction.\nTherefore there is no stable nonassortative\nmatch.\nPROOF OF PROPOSITION 3:\nBy Proposition 2, we can restrict attention on\nassortative matches. Since n0p \u0002 n0a, there are\nunemployed profit-oriented principals. There-\nfore, all employed principals in the profit-\noriented sector must be earning zero profits. The\nstated contracts are optimal according to Prop-\nosition 1 relative to a common reservation pay-\noff for all types of agents of:\nu\u02c6 \u0004\n1\n8 \u0007\u00020 \u0006 \u0003\u000202 \b 4w\u0001 \b2 \u0006 w\u0001 .\nThis is the payoff that an agent of any type\nwho is matched with a principal of type 0\nreceives when the principal\u2019s expected payoff\nis zero and can be obtained by setting i \u0001 0 in\nthe expression for v\u0002 ij in the proof of Lem-\nma 3. Accordingly, this is the relevant reser-\nvation payoff of all agents under full employ-\nment. We proceed to prove that the proposed\nassortative matching is stable.\nAll employed principals in the profit-\noriented sector are earning zero profits. They\ncannot therefore attract away an unmotivated\nagent from another profit-oriented principal\nwithout earning a negative profit. Hence the\nmatching within the unmotivated sector is\nstable.\nAn agent of type j ( j \u0001 1, 2) receives a payoff\nof v ja \u0001 max{1\u20448 \f2 \u0006 w\u0001 , u\u02c6} \u0003 v\u02c6 a. Since this is\nthe same for both types of motivated agents, and\n\u0010*ii (z) \u0002 \u0010*ij (z) for i \u0001 1, 2 and for all j \u0001 0, 1,\n2, the proposed matching is stable within the\nmission-oriented sector.\nFinally, we show that matching between the\nprofit-oriented and mission-oriented sectors is\nstable.\nLet us define the following function to sim-\nplify notation:\ng\u0007x1, x2\b\u0004 \u00032\u0007x1\b w\u0001 \b\u0007x2\b \u00032\u0007x1\b w\u0001 \b\b\b w\u0001 .\nThis gives the payoff of a principal under an\noptimal contract when the participation con-\nstraint is binding, the reservation payoff of the\nagent is x1, and the joint payoff of the principal\nand the agent from success is x2 (e.g., if the\nprincipal is type i and the agent is type j then\nx2 \u0001 \u0002i \u0006 \u0003ij).\nFirst we show that a principal of type 0 will\nnot be better off hiring an agent of type 1 or 2\nby offering him a payoff of at least v\u02c6 a compared\nto what he earns under the proposed match with\nan unmotivated agent. Currently such a princi-\npal earns an expected payoff of 0. If he hires an\nagent of type j ( j \u0001 1, 2) the participation\nconstraint will bind since 1\u20448 (\f \u0006 \u0003\u0002)2 \u0006 w\u0001 \u0001\n1\u20448\u000202 \u0006 w\u0001 for i \u0001 1, 2 (by Assumption 3). There\nare two cases to be considered. First, v\u02c6a \u0002 u\u02c6.\nThen the maximum payoff that a principal of\ntype 0 can earn from an agent of type j ( j \u0001 1, 2)\nis g(v\u02c6 a, \u00020) \u000b g(u\u02c6, \u00020) as v\u02c6 a \u0002 u\u02c6. But by\nconstruction g(u\u02c6, \u0002) \u0001 0 in the full-employment\ncase and so such a move is not attractive. Sim-\nilarly, if v\u02c6a \u0001 u\u02c6, the maximum payoff that a\nprincipal of type 0 can earn from an agent of\ntype j ( j \u0001 1, 2) is g(u\u02c6, \u00020), which is the same\nthat he earns in his current match.\nNext we show that a principal of type i (i \u0001\n1, 2) will not find it profitable to attract an\nunmotivated agent who earns u\u02c6. A principal of\ntype i (i \u0001 1, 2) can earn at most g(u\u02c6, \u0002\u02c6) from\nsuch a move, which is strictly less than g(u\u02c6, \u0002\u02c6\u0006\n\u0003\u0002) (what he was earning before), in case the\nparticipation constraint was binding. Now let us\nconsider the possibility that the participation\nconstraint was not binding. Notice that g(u\u02c6,\n\u0002\u02c6) \u0001 1\u20442 (\u00020 \u0006 \u000f\u000202 \f 4w\u0001 ){\u0002\u02c6 \f 1\u20442 (\u00020 \u0006\n\u000f\u00020\n2 \f 4w\u0001 )} \f w\u0001 \r 1\u20444 \u0002\u02c62 \f w\u0001 (since the\nexpression 1\u20442 y(a \f 1\u20442 y) is maximized at y \u0001\na). As the participation constraint was not bind-\ning by assumption in this case, the principal was\nearning either \u0002\u02c6\u0003\u0002 \f w\u0001 (if \u0003\u0002 \u0002 \u0002\u02c6) or (\u0002\u02c6 \u0006\n\u0003\u0002)2\/4 \f w\u0001 (if \u0003\u0002 \r \u0002\u02c6). In the former case, as \u0003\u0002 \u0002\n\u0002\u02c6, \u0002\u02c6\u0003\u0002 \f w\u0001 \u0002 1\u20444 \u0002\u02c62 \f w\u0001 . In the latter case,\n1\u20444 \u0002\u02c62 \f w\u0001 \r (\u0002\u02c6\u0006 \u0003\u0002)2\/4 \f w\u0001 for all \u0003\u0002 \u0001 0, \u0002\u02c6\u0002\n0. Thus, the proposed matching is stable as\nclaimed.\nPROOF OF PROPOSITION 4:\nThe stated contracts are optimal contract ac-\ncording to Proposition 1 and Corollary 1, rela-\ntive to a common reservation payoff of zero.\nThis is what we would expect as n0p \u000b n0a and so\n634 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW JUNE 2005\nthere are unemployed agents. The rest of the\nproof is similar to that of Proposition 3 and is\nhence omitted.\nREFERENCES\nAcemoglu, Daron; Kremer, Michael and Mian,\nAtif. \u201cIncentives in Markets, Firms and Gov-\nernments.\u201d National Bureau of Economic Re-\nsearch, Inc., NBER Working Papers: No.\n9802, 2003.\nAckerberg, Daniel A. and Botticini, Maristella.\n\u201cEndogenous Matching and the Empirical\nDeterminants of Contract Form.\u201d Journal of\nPolitical Economy, 2002, 110(3), pp. 564\u2013\n91.\nAghion, Philippe and Tirole, Jean. \u201cFormal and\nReal Authority in Organizations.\u201d Journal\nof Political Economy, 1997, 105(1), pp.\n1\u201329.\nAkerlof, George and Kranton, Rachel. \u201cIdentity\nand Schooling: Some Lessons for the Eco-\nnomics of Education.\u201d Journal of Economic\nLiterature, 2002, 40(4), pp. 1167\u20131201.\nAkerlof, George and Kranton, Rachel. \u201cIdentity\nand the Economics of Organizations.\u201d Jour-\nnal of Economic Perspectives, 2005, 19(1),\npp. 9\u201332.\nAlesina, Alberto and Tabellini, Guido. \u201cBureau-\ncrats or Politicians.\u201d National Bureau of Eco-\nnomic Research, Inc., NBER Working\nPapers: No. 10241, 2004.\nArnould, Richard; Bertrand, Marianne and Hal-\nlock, Kevin F. \u201cDoes Managed Care Change\nthe Mission of Nonprofit Hospitals?
