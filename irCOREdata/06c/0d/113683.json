Introduction \n \nThe investigation of direct electron transfer between redox enzymes and electrodes is \nimportant in the development of electroanalytical applications and of bioelectrocatalytic \ndevices. Such bioelectronic devices require an optimized procedure for enzyme \nimmobilization e.g. operational simplicity, low fabrication expense and enzyme activity \nin the long term. Electrode material with special physical and chemical properties, \nbiocompatibility and low cost are important factors considered for immobilization of \nenzymes [1]. Enzymes are typically immobilized using a range of different strategies \ninvolving materials such as inorganic supports and synthetic polymers e.g. Fe2O3\u2013 or Au\u2013\nnanoparticles, Nafion\u2013nanotube composites, self\u2013assembled material layers, and \nconducting polymers [2, 3]. These synthetic materials are easily to process, however, they \nare less suitable for enzyme immobilization due to undesirable surface characteristics and \nlow biocompatibility, which increase the denaturation of the protein [4]. In contrast, \nnaturally occurring macromolecular soft materials are pertinent to enzyme \nimmobilization technologies owing to their biocompatibility. Cellulose, which is present \nin the cell walls of plants, is the most abundant and renewable biopolymer on earth and \nhas many advantages when used as an enzyme immobilization material because of its \nbiocompatibility, chemical stability, mechanical and physical properties, availability from \nrenewable natural resources, and low cost [5]. Cellulose derivatives, such as cellulose \nnitrate, cellulose acetate, carboxymethyl cellulose, have been used as carriers for \nimmobilized enzymes [6-8]. However, the application of natural cellulose has been \nhindered by its poor solubility, due to the presence of strong inter\u2013 and intra\u2013molecular \nhydrogen bonding.  \nRecent studies have showed that a number of room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), e.g. \n1\u2013ethyl\u20133\u2013methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM][CH3COO]) and 1\u2013butyl\u20133\u2013\nmethylimidazolium chloride (BMIMCl), exhibit good dissolution power for cellulose, \nwhich can then be reconstituted into a variety of forms such as membranes, beads and \nhollow fibers [9, 10]. [EMIM][CH3COO] has also been reported to be an enzyme\u2013\nfriendly co\u2013solvent for organic reactions [11]. Turner et al. have developed cellulose\u2013\nRTIL composite materials for the immobilization of laccase with the retention of catalytic \nactivity using BMIMCl [12]. In the field of bioelectrochemistry, however, RTIL\u2013\nreconstituted cellulose materials have not been given the appropriate level of attention. \nDue to their outstanding physicochemical properties, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are \nattracting considerable attention for the development of bioelectrochemical devices. \nHowever, the poor dispersibility of carbon nanotubes has traditionally been a major \ntechnical barrier to their application. Some researchers have shown that RTILs can assist \nin the dispersion of carbon nanotubes and impart useful properties in their application in \nbioelectronics [13-18].  \nIn this communication, we report a simple method to immobilize enzymes in a cellulose \u2013 \nmultiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) matrix reconstituted by [EMIM][CH3COO], and \non the subsequent use of this matrix to modify electrodes with glucose oxidase (GOx) as \na model enzyme. The direct electron transfer between the active site of GOx and \nelectrode has been achieved, while its behaviour as biosensor and the enzyme\u2019s stability \nwere investigated by electrochemical techniques. \n \n 3\n2. Experimental section \n \n2.1 Chemicals, reagents and pretreatments \n \nGlucose oxidase (GOx, EC 1.1.3.4, 200 units mg\u20131, from Aspergillus niger), \nMicrocrystalline cellulose and 1\u2013ethyl\u20133\u2013methylimidazolium acetate \n([EMIM][CH3COO]) were purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich and used with no additional \npurification. Multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT, Nanocyl\u20133100 series with an \naverage diameter of 10 nm) were refluxed in HNO3 (aq, 2.6 M) for 10 h, followed by \nprecipitation, rinsing with distilled water to eliminate the residual HNO3, and drying in a \nvacuum oven at 80\u00b0C for 12 h [19]. D\u2013Glucose solutions were prepared the day before \nuse and allowed to stand overnight to allow equilibration of the monomers. All solutions \nwere prepared with ultrapure water (18.2 M\u03a9 cm\u20131) from a Select Fusion system (Purite \nCorporation). \n \n2.2 Electrode modification \n \nGlassy carbon (GC, 3 mm diameter) was sequentially polished with 1.0 and 0.5 \u00b5m \nalumina slurry and then washed ultrasonically in ultrapure water for a few minutes. The \ncellulose\u2013MWCNT\u2013GOx modified GC electrodes were prepared as follows: the cellulose \n(3.0% mass)\u2013[EMIM][CH3COO] solution was obtained by thoroughly mixing cellulose \nand [EMIM][CH3COO] and then heating to 70oC for 1 h in an ultrasonic bath until an \noptically clear solution was obtained. The MWCNT (1.0% mass) were then suspended in \nthe [EMIM][CH3COO]\u2013cellulose solution by grinding in an agate mortar for 15 min \nunder high purity nitrogen to prevent the [EMIM][CH3COO] from absorbing moisture. \nGOx (3.3% mass) was finally added to the resulting mixture to afford the target GOx\u2013\ncellulose\u2013MWCNT\u2013RTIL dispersion. A 10 \u00b5L aliquot of this solution was evenly spread \non the GC surface and the modified electrode was then immersed in deionized water, to \nremove the [EMIM][CH3COO] by dissolution, leaving the cellulose\u2013MWCNT matrix \nwith encapsulated GOx on the surface; the [EMIM][CH3COO] can be recovered by \ndistillation for reuse. The electrode was dried at room temperature and stored dry in air at \n4\u00b0C until required. \n \n2.3 Apparatus and electrochemical measurements \n \nA Hitachi S2300 SEM was used to characterize modified electrode with an acceleration \nvoltage of 5.0 kV. Electrochemical measurements were carried out using an Autolab \nPGSTAT (EcoChemie, Netherlands) in a three\u2013electrode cell with 25 mL volume. The \ncellulose\u2013MWCNT\u2013GOx modified GC was used as a working electrode, a Pt\u2013wire \nserved as a counter electrode and the reference electrode was an Ag\/AgCl type (3 M \nNaCl, +0.196 V vs. SHE at 298 K). The electrolyte was aqueous citrate phosphate buffer \n(0.2 M), which was purged with either high purity nitrogen or air for testing. All \nelectrochemical experiments were carried out at 22 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C. \n \n3. Results and discussion \n \n 4\n3.1. Characteristics of the cellulose \u2013 MWCNT matrix \n \nFig. 1 shows a SEM image of the RTIL reconstituted cellulose\u2013MWCNT matrix which \nhas a porous and three-dimensional structure. This electrically conductive, porous and \nbiocompatibable microenvironment is a candidate for an enzyme immobilization host \nwith the potential for enhanced direct electron transfer between the active site of enzyme \nand long\u2013term electrode stability.  \n \n<Fig. 1 near here> \n \n \n3.2 Direct electron transfer of GOx \n \nGOx is of considerable commercial importance and has wide-ranging applications in the \nfood and fermentation industry and clinical analysis [20-23]. GOx is an enzyme with a \nmolecular weight of 160 kDa and contains flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as the \nredox prosthetic group, which can catalyze the oxidation of \u03b2-D-glucose in the presence \nof molecular oxygen. However, from a bioelectrochemical perspective, the FAD in the \nGOx is deeply embedded within a protective protein shell and the direct electron transfer \nreaction between GOx and electrode does not occur easily [24].  \n \n<Fig. 2 near here> \n \nFig. 2A shows the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of a cellulose\u2013MWCNT\u2013GOx modified \nelectrode in a N2\u2013saturated buffer at increasing scan rates. The anodic and cathodic peak \npotentials at a scan rate of 100 mV s\u20131 are located at \u2013357 and \u2013386 mV vs. Ag\/AgCl \nrespectively (see Fig. 2B). The peaks are attributable to the reduction and oxidation of the \nFAD\/FADH2 electroactive centre of the GOx enzyme by a direct electron transfer process \n(reaction 1) [25]; redox peaks were not observed with a protein\u2013free cellulose\u2013MWCNT \nmodified electrode in the potential range \u2013 650 to 0 mV. \n \n          GOx(FAD) + 2e- + 2H+ \u21cc GOx(FADH2)  (1) \n \nThe redox potentials do not vary at the different scan rates, and the separation of the \ncathodic and anodic peak potentials for each is 29 \u00b1 3 mV, which implies that the \nreaction is a reversible two\u2013electron reversible redox process (reaction 1). The anodic and \ncathodic currents were both linearly proportional to the scan rate (inset of Fig. 2A), \nindicating that the electrode reaction is a surface confined process [26]. \n \n3.3 Effect of solution pH on the modified electrode \n \nA series of experiments was performed to study the dependence of potential response on \nthe solution pH. Fig. 3 shows that an increase of pH causes a negative shift in both the \nreduction and oxidation peak potentials. The linear regression is Eo'\/V= \u20130.032 \u2013 \n0.058pH, where Eo' is the formal potential [Eo' = (Epa + Epc) \/ 2] and the linear regression \ncoefficient R2 = 0.997. The slope of \u201358 mV pH\u20131 (Fig. 2, inset) is very close to the \n 5\ntheoretical value of \u201358.5 mV pH\u20131 expected at 22oC for a reversible, 2\u2013proton and 2\u2013\nelectron transfer process according to the reaction 1. \n \n<Fig. 3 near here> \n \n \n3.4 Biocatalytic activity of the modified electrode  \n \n<Fig. 4 near here> \n \nCompared with N2\u2013saturated buffer (Fig. 4A, curve a), a pair of well defined GOx redox \npeaks were also observed in air\u2013saturated buffer (Fig. 4A, curve c) in the absence of \nglucose, with an increased reduction peak current and a decreased oxidation peak current. \nAfter the addition of glucose (0.5 mM) into the buffer, the reduction peak current \ndecreased significantly (Fig. 4, curve b). The reason is that the dissolved oxygen and \nGOx take part in the non\u2013electrochemical oxidation of glucose. This phenomenon can be \nexplained by the following, previously proposed, mechanism [27, 28]: \n \nGOx(FADH2) + O2 \u2192 GOx(FAD) + H2O2     (2) \n \nGOx(FAD) + Glucose \u2192 GOx(FADH2) + Gluconolactone   (3) \n \nIn the presence of oxygen, the reduced enzyme GOx(FADH2) is quickly oxidized to the \noxidized form GOx(FAD) via reaction 2. The electrocatalytic regeneration of the \nreduced?? enzyme via reaction 1 causes the loss of reversibility and the increase in size of \nthe cathodic peak current. As the substrate of GOx, the presence of glucose may result an \nenzyme\u2013catalyzed reaction according to reaction 3 which will decrease the concentration \nof the oxidized form of GOx on electrode surface thus lead to the decrease of reduction \npeak current. These results provide evidence that the GOx, encapsulated by the RTIL \nformulated cellulose\u2013MWCNT composite, still retains its biocatalytic activity towards \nglucose oxidation.  \nThe decrease of the reduction peak current can be utilized as a tool to determine the \nglucose concentration. Fig. 5 shows a typical current\u2013time curve of the GOx electrode on \nsuccessive additions of 0.2 mM glucose when the electrode was poised at \u2013500 mV vs \nAg\/AgCl in an air\u2013saturated solution. The current values change linearly with the \nconcentration of glucose from 0.05 to 1.0 mM with a linear regression equation of I = \n0.68 \u2212 0.46 \u00d7 [glucose] and a correlation coefficient of 0.9995. The sensitivity of the \ncellulose\u2013MWCNT\u2013GOx electrode is 6.57 \u00b5A mM\u22121 cm\u22122 which is higher than reported \nin earlier studies (3.3 \u00b5A mM\u22121 cm\u22122 at chitosan modified electrodes [26] and 3.47 \u00b5A \nmM\u22121 cm\u22122 at silica gel based electrodes [27]).  \n \n<Fig. 5 near here> \n \nThe apparent Michaelis-Menten constant Km of the GOx was determined by Michaelis\u2013\nMenten equation to be 1.10 mM. The value is also lower compared to previously reports \n 6\n(6.8 mM [29] and 15.19 mM [30]), which indicates an enhanced enzyme affinity of GOx \nto glucose with the biocompatible microenvironment of the cellulose\u2013MWCNT matrix. \n \n3.5 Reproducibility and stability  \n \nThe reproducibility and stability of the proposed GOx electrode have also been \ninvestigated. The fabrication reproducibility of five electrodes, made independently under \nthe same conditions, showed an acceptable reproducibility for the current determined at \n0.2 mM glucose concentrations (evidence?). The stability of the electrode was tested by \nrepeated CV scanning in a potential range from \u2013650 to 0 mV vs Ag\/AgCl at 100 mV s\u20131; \nthe modified electrode showed an unchanged peak current after 200 cycles (see Fig. 2B). \nThe electrode was tested again after the bioelectrode was stored for 10 days and a \ndecrease of only 11% in peak currents was observed.  \nThese favorable results could be mainly attributed to two factors: firstly, cellulose, \nendowed with a large amount of \u2013OH groups, provides a biocompatible environment for \nencapsulation of GOx; secondly, as the SEM image shown in Fig. 1, the cellulose\u2013\nMWCNT matrix possesses a porous structure, allowing a large amount of enzyme to be \nimmobilized close to the electrode surface, where direct electron communication between \nactive site of enzyme and electrode is enabled.  \n \n \n4. Conclusions \n \nThis work reports a simple procedure for the preparation of a biocompatible cellulose\u2013\nMWCNT matrix via the RTIL reconstitution process, and the porous matrix has been \nemployed in the immobilization of GOx (as an example enzyme). The encapsulated GOx \nshowed good bioelectrochemical activity, high biological affinity as well as good stability \nand repeatability. The simple electrode fabrication methodology and the biocompatibility \nof the cellulose\u2013MWCNT matrix mean that the immobilization matrix not only can be \nused for GOx but also can be extended to other proteins, thus providing a promising \nplatform for the further research and development for biosensor and other bioelectronics \ndevices. Further investigations into electrochemical properties of the cellulose\u2013MWCNT \nmatrix and immobilization process with different enzymes, with the objective of \ndeveloping enzymatic fuel cells, are underway. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis research was supported by the U.K.\u2019s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research \nCouncil\u2019s Supergen5 Biological Fuel Cells Consortium programme (EPSRC contract \nEP\/D047943\/1).
