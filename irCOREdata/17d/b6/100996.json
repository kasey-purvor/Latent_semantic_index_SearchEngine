The discrete single-particle energies are clus-\ntered, giving rise to the shell structure of the nucleus [1].\nLarge energy gaps between groups of single-particle orbits\noccur at certain fillings of these orbits with a \u2018\u2018magic\nnumber\u2019\u2019 of protons or neutrons. The nuclear potential\nand resulting shell structure have been established for\nstable nuclei. Modifications to this shell structure in exotic\nnuclei with a large imbalance of protons and neutrons have\nalready been observed: New magic numbers develop and\nconventional shell gaps break down [2]. Present experi-\nmental and theoretical efforts in nuclear physics are aimed\nat probing the driving forces behind those structural\nchanges, which are most prominent in neutron-rich nuclei.\nHistorically, measurements of the mass of the neutron-\nrich 31;32Na isotopes revealed that they are more tightly\nbound than expected if one assumes a spherical shape and\nthe validity of the conventional shell closure at neutron\nnumber N \u0004 20 [3]. Further evidence for an onset of\ndeformation in neutron-rich nuclei around 31Na emerged\nfrom the low excitation energy of the first 2\u0002 state of 32Mg\n[4], and from the large B\u0001E2; 0\u0002 ! 2\u00021 \u0003 excitation strength\n[5]. Shell-model calculations that allow for neutron\nparticle-hole excitations across the N \u0004 20 shell gap re-\nproduced the experimentally observed onset of deforma-\ntion in this region. The \u0002\u0001sd\u0003\u00052\u0001fp\u0003\u00022 particle-hole\n\u2018\u2018intruder\u2019\u2019 configurations (2@!) were proposed to domi-\nnate the ground states of neutron-rich nuclei with 10 \u0006\nZ \u0006 12 and 20 \u0006 N \u0006 22 [6]. This region, where the\ndeformation-driving 2@! states are energetically favored\nover the normal\u20140@!\u2014shell-model configurations, is\ncalled the \u2018\u2018island of inversion\u2019\u2019 [6]. The breakdown of\nthe N \u0004 20 shell closure in this region was later put into\nthe broader scheme of shell evolution driven by the spin-\nisospin properties of the effective nucleon-nucleon\ninteraction [2].\nIn the chain of Mg isotopes, experimental evidence\n[4,5,7\u201312] confirmed the onset of collectivity and the\npresence of intruder configurations and placed 31\u201334Mg\ninside the island of inversion. 30Mg was found to be less\ncollective and well described by calculations involving\nonly 0@! configurations [8,13]. On the neutron-rich side,\nhowever, so far hardly any data exist on the structure of the\nmost exotic nuclei with N > 22. Warburton et al. predict\nthe island to extend to neutron number N \u0004 22 with mag-\nnesium isotopes heavier than 34Mg outside [6], while\nUtsuno et al. predict 36Mg to have intruder configurations\nin the ground state wave function [14].\nThe recently developed Monte Carlo shell model\n(MCSM) with the SDPF-M effective interaction [14] al-\nlows unrestricted mixing of neutron particle-hole configu-\nrations across the N \u0004 20 shell gap and thus provides for\nthe first time a consistent picture of the island of inversion\nand its neighborhood. In particular, the probabilities of\n0@! configurations and 2@! cross-shell excitations can\nbe quantified [15]. Experimental information on the inter-\nplay of normal and intruder configurations thus poses a\nbenchmark test for the sd-pf cross-shell interaction and\nthe validity of the theoretical model space.\nIn this Letter we report on the first nuclear spectroscopy\nstudy of 36Mg. At all present rare-isotope facilities, the\nproduction rates for this exotic nucleus are insufficient to\nperform inelastic scattering experiments or direct reactions\nemploying a beam of 36Mg. Furthermore, 36Mg cannot be\npopulated in \u0003 decay since the parent 36Na is neutron\nPRL 99, 072502 (2007) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending17 AUGUST 2007\n0031-9007=07=99(7)=072502(4) 072502-1 \u00a9 2007 The American Physical Society\nunbound. Another approach has to be chosen to reveal the\nnuclear structure of 36Mg. In the present study, we used the\n9Be\u000138Si; 36Mg\u0002 \u0001\u0003X two-proton knockout reaction at\n83 MeV=nucleon to populate 36Mg. This will be the\nmost neutron-rich nucleus with Z \u0004 12 accessible to\n\u0001-ray spectroscopy until next-generation rare-isotope fa-\ncilities are operational.\nThe 38Si secondary beam was produced by fragmenta-\ntion of a 140 MeV=nucleon 48Ca primary beam delivered\nby the Coupled Cyclotron Facility of the National\nSuperconducting Cyclotron Laboratory. The primary\nbeam was directed onto a 752 mg=cm2 9Be production\ntarget. 38Si of 95% purity was selected in the A1900 frag-\nment separator [16] at 1.66% momentum acceptance. The\n38Si secondary beam interacted with a 376\u00014\u0003 mg=cm2\nthick 9Be reaction target placed at the reaction target\nposition of the large-acceptance S800 spectrograph [17].\nAt 2:5\u0007 1011=s 48Ca primary beam rate, the typical rate of\n38Si on target was 1500 per second. The projectiles were\nidentified using the time-of-flight difference measured be-\ntween two scintillators before the reaction target. The\nreaction residues were identified on an event-by-event\nbasis in the focal plane of the S800 spectrograph from\nthe energy loss measured in the ionization chamber and\nthe time of flight measured between plastic scintillators\n(see Fig. 1).\nThe secondary 9Be target was surrounded by the high-\nresolution \u0001-ray detection system SeGA, an array of 32-\nfold segmented HPGe detectors [18]. The segmentation of\nthe detectors allows an event-by-event Doppler reconstruc-\ntion that deduces the angle of the \u0001-ray emission from the\nposition of the segment that registered the highest energy\ndeposition. Sixteen detectors were arranged in two rings\n(90\b and 37\b central angles with respect to the beam axis).\nThe 37\b ring was equipped with seven detectors while nine\ndetectors were located at 90\b. The energy-dependent pho-\ntopeak efficiency of the array was determined with a 152Eu\nsource (2.6% at 1 MeV).\nAn inclusive cross section of 0.10(1) mb for the\n9Be\u000138Si; 36Mg\u0003X reaction was derived from the yield of\n36Mg reaction residues divided by the number of incoming\n38Si projectiles relative to the number density of the reac-\ntion target. This corresponds to one 36Mg ion for each 4\u0007\n105 incoming 38Si projectiles. Systematic uncertainties of\n4% and 2% attributed to the stability of the incoming beam\nand the choice of the software gates, respectively, are\nassumed to be independent and have been added in quad-\nrature to the statistical uncertainty.\nIn coincidence with the 36Mg residues, a \u0001-ray transition\nat 660(6) keV was detected in SeGA (see Fig. 2). This\n\u0001-ray transition is attributed to the decay of the 2\u00021 state of\n36Mg to the 0\u0002 ground state. From the efficiency-corrected\n\u0001-ray peak area, the number of reaction residues produced\nin this excited state was determined. The 2\u0002 ! 0\u0002 \u0001-ray\nangular distribution was calculated from the m-substate\ndistribution predicted by the eikonal reaction theory of\nthe two-proton knockout [19] and found to have a negli-\ngible effect for the angular range covered by SeGA (see\nFig. 2).

The\n\u0001-ray angular distribution for this transition (solid red curve) is\ncalculated from the m-state distribution provided by the reaction\ntheory and compared to an isotropic, Lorentz-boosted distribu-\ntion.

This corresponds to\npartial cross sections of \u0004\u00010\u0002\u0003 \u0004 0:058\u00019\u0003 mb and\n\u0004\u00012\u00021 \u0003 \u0004 0:042\u00018\u0003 mb for the population of final states in\n36Mg. There is no experimental evidence for the population\nof other excited states with appreciable cross section.\nThe lower panel of Fig. 2 shows the evolution of the\nE\u00012\u00021 \u0003 energy in the chain of Mg isotopes from mass A \u0004\n30 to 36. The experimental energies are compared to all\navailable model calculations that provide a prediction for\n36Mg. Relative to 30Mg, the E\u00012\u00021 \u0003 energy drops for 32Mg\nwhere a rise would be expected in a picture based on 0@!\nconfigurations only. All calculations overpredict the 2\u00021\nexcitation energy of 36Mg. The model of [20] treats corre-\nlations beyond the mean field and describes the energy\ntrend very well but is offset by several hundred keV. The\nMCSM calculation with the SDPF-M effective interaction\nprovides an excellent description of the 2\u00021 excitation en-\nergies in the chain of Mg isotopes. The large-scale con-\nventional shell-model calculations by Caurier et al. [21]\noverpredict the 2\u00021 energy of 36Mg only by 200 keV\nalthough it uses the 0@! model space only. For compari-\nson, another shell-model calculation that does not allow for\nintruder configurations (using the interaction of [24]) pla-\nces the 2\u00021 of 36Mg at 970 keV and thus underestimates the\ncollectivity more. It becomes clear that the excitation\nenergy alone may not be indicative of intruder contribu-\ntions in 36Mg.\nThe question arises whether 36Mg can be considered to\nlie inside or outside of the island of inversion. The MCSM\ncalculation using the SDPF-M effective interaction pre-\ndicts strong mixing of 2@! intruder and 0@! normal\nconfigurations in the wave functions of the lowest-lying\nstates of 36Mg and thus makes this nucleus a testing\nground. The composition of the ground state and the 2\u00021\nexcited state are predicted to be (40.8%, 58.6%) and\n(39.9%, 59.5%) of (0@!, 2@!), respectively. 4@! compo-\nnents are negligible at 0.7% or less. In the following we\noutline how the two-proton removal from 38Si to 36Mg can\nbe used to assess this composition experimentally.\nIn the collision of a neutron-rich projectile beam with a\nlight target, for example, 9Be, the sudden removal of two\nprotons has been shown to proceed as a direct reaction not\nonly providing information on nuclear structure but also on\ntwo-nucleon correlation effects in the nuclear wave func-\ntions [19,25\u201329]. The competing two-step process is en-\nergetically strongly hindered for the present case. A\nnondirect population of the bound states of 36Mg by one-\nproton removal and subsequent proton evaporation would\ninvolve states more than 14 MeV above the low neutron\nseparation energy of 37Al. A reaction theory formalism,\nusing eikonal dynamics and microscopic, correlated two-\nnucleon transition densities from shell-model calculations,\nhas been developed to include two-nucleon stripping (in-\nelastic breakup) and diffraction dissociation [19,29]. The\ntwo-nucleon amplitudes carry the nuclear structure details\non the parentage and phase of the participating two-\nnucleon configurations in the ground state of the projectile\nwith respect to the final states of the projectilelike reaction\nresidue. The reaction 9Be\u000138Si; 36Mg\u0003X is of particular\ninterest since it proceeds from 38Si, with a nonintruder\nground state that is well described by 0@! configurations\n[30], to 36Mg which is expected to exhibit very significant\n2@! components in the wave functions of the lowest-lying\nstates. Thus, in the direct removal of two protons from the\nground state of 38Si, only 0@! configurations in 36Mg can\nbe reached. The cross sections measured in this reaction\nthus allow one to quantify these nonintruder components in\nthe wave functions of the final states of 36Mg.\nThe eikonal S matrices for elastic scattering of protons\nand 36Mg on 9Be were calculated as described in [19]. The\nprotons in the ground state of 38Si were assumed to occupy\nsd-shell orbitals with two-nucleon amplitudes in the 0@!\nspace obtained [31] using the SDPF-M effective interac-\ntion. The proton single-particle wave functions were cal-\nculated from Woods-Saxon potentials. Based on \t1d5=2\n2\ncalculations using a range of binding potentials, with\n1:20< r0 < 1:35 fm, 0:60< a< 0:75 fm, and 0<Vso <\n6 MeV, that generate single-particle states with rms radii\nin the range 3.25\u20133.57 fm, the computed cross sections\nscale linearly (each to better than 3%) with the mean\nsquared radius of the orbital. There is negligible depen-\ndence on potential parameters beyond their effect on this\nradial extent. We thus constrain the orbital radii by choos-\ning r0 to reproduce the rms radii of the d5=2, d3=2, and s1=2\norbits from the HF calculation and use a standard potential\nset with a \u0004 0:7 fm and Vso \u0004 6 MeV. The depths of the\npotentials were chosen to match the ground and excited-\nstate two-proton separation energies, respectively. With\nthis prescription, we calculate cross sections of 0.36 mb\nto the 0\u0002 ground state and of 0.28 mb to the first 2\u0002 state in\n36Mg. The calculated cross sections are most sensitive to\nthe choice of the rms radius of the core. A change of\n0.05 fm results in a change of 7.5% in the cross section.\nTo constrain the geometry best, the density of 36Mg was\ntaken from a spherical Skyrme Hartree-Fock calculation\n[32], having a rms matter radius of 3.34 fm.\nThis theoretical approach, when applied to five test cases\nof two-nucleon knockout from sd-shell configurations,\noverestimates the measured cross sections [33]. A fit to\nthose data requires a suppression of the shell-model spec-\ntroscopic strengths by a factor Rs\u00012N\u0003 \u000b 0:5 [19]. This\nreduction, the two-nucleon analog of the suppressions (Rs)\nobserved in electron- and nuclear-induced single-nucleon\nknockout reactions [34], has to be taken into account in any\nquantitative comparison. Here, we use the weighted mean\nof the five test cases with an added 15% systematic uncer-\ntainty; that is, Rs\u00012N\u0003 \u0004 0:50\u00018\u0003. In the single-nucleon\nPRL 99, 072502 (2007) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending17 AUGUST 2007\n072502-3\ncase, a dependence of the Rs on the asymmetry at the\nneutron and proton Fermi surfaces has been reported\n[35,36]. Any such dependence of the Rs\u00012N\u0003 has yet to\nbe established. With Rs\u00012N\u0003 \u0004 0:50\u00018\u0003 we obtain partial\ncross sections of \u0004th\u00010\u0002\u0003 \u0004 0:15\u00012\u0003 mb and \u0004th\u00012\u00021 \u0003 \u0004\n0:13\u00012\u0003 mb.\nThe ratio of the measured partial cross sections b \u0004\n\u0004\u00012\u00021 \u0003=\u0004\u00010\u0002\u0003 \u0004 0:72\u000115\u0003 is reproduced by the calculation\nwith bth \u0004 0:87. Given that the 2@! components of the\nwave functions of 36Mg have no overlap with the 0@!\nconfigurations in the ground state of 38Si, these partial\ncross sections can now be compared with the measured\nvalues to quantify the 0@! components. Thus, the ratios\n\u0004\u00010\u0002\u0003=\u0004th\u00010\u0002\u0003 \u0004 0:38\u00018\u0003 and \u0004\u00012\u00021 \u0003=\u0004th\u00012\u00021 \u0003 \u0004 0:32\u00018\u0003\nimply 38(8)% and 32(8)% of 0@! components in the\nground and 2\u00021 states of 36Mg, respectively. These are\ncompared to MCSM calculations in the lower panel of\nFig. 3, showing that the measured results are reproduced.\nOur estimate, based on the mismatch between the ex-\nperimental and theoretical cross sections, is consistent with\nthe 0@! fractions predicted by the MCSM, placing 36Mg\ninside the island of inversion. Figure 3 also shows the\npredicted composition of the wave function of the second\nexcited 2\u0002 state of 36Mg. Both the very small 0@! com-\nponent in this 2\u00022 state and the small calculated cross\nsection to the first 4\u0002 state, an order of magnitude smaller\nthan those for the 0\u0002 and 2\u00021 states, are consistent with the\nnonobservation of these states in the present experiment.\nThe second 0\u0002 state is predicted to lie above the neutron\nseparation energy and thus is not accessible by \u0001-ray\nspectroscopy.\nIn summary, we have used the direct two-proton knock-\nout reaction 9Be\u000138Si; 36Mg\u0002 \u0001\u0003X at 83 MeV=nucleon to\nperform spectroscopy of the very neutron-rich nucleus\n36Mg for the first time. The 2\u00021 state was observed at\n660(6) keV excitation energy. Partial cross sections to the\nground and first 2\u0002 state were measured and the wave\nfunctions of these lowest-lying states were found to be\ndominated by intruder configurations, as suggested by\nstate-of-the-art large-scale MCSM calculations. This pla-\nces 36Mg within the island of inversion.\nThis work was supported by the National Science\nFoundation under Grants No. PHY-0606007 and\nNo. PHY-0555366, by the U.K. Engineering and Physical\nSciences Research Council (Grant No. EP\/D003628), in\npart by a Grant-in-Aid for Specially Promoted Research\n(No. 13002001) from the MEXT, and by the JSPS Core-to-\nCore program.\n[1] M.
