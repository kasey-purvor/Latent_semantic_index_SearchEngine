Cultural diversity has always characterised Europe, \nbut growing potentials for mobility and communication have led to the \nemergence and intensification of diverse cultural experiences and formations. \nIn this context, the growing numbers and kinds of diasporic media have \nsignificant implications for imagining multicultural Europe and for participating \n(or not) in European societies and transnational communities. What is argued \nhere is that diasporic media cultures do not emerge as projects that oppose \nthe universalistic projects of Europe and of global communication, but that \nthey gain from ideologies of globalisation and democratic participation, as \nmuch as they gain and depend on ideologies of identity and particularism. \nDrawing from a cross-European mapping and specific case studies, I will try \nto explain why diasporic media cultures challenge both the limits of European \nuniversalism and of diasporic particularism. \n \n \nKeywords \n \nDiaspora, Transnational Communications, Universalism-Particularism, \nMulticulturalism \n \n \nBiographical Note \n \nMyria Georgiou is a lecturer in International Communications at the Institute of \nCommunication Studies, University of Leeds. Her research focuses on \ntransnational communications, identity and community. Her PhD (LSE) was \nan ethnographic study of media consumption and its role in ethnic identity \nconstruction, in the case of Greek Cypriots of London. Following her PhD, she \nconducted a cross-European research on diasporic media cultures across the \nEU (LSE). Recent publications include: (2001) \u2018Crossing the Boundaries of the \nEthnic Home: Media Consumption and Ethnic Identity Construction in the \nPublic Space\u2019.

Hommes & Migrations, No. 1240. \nForthcoming: Diaspora, Identity and the Media (Hampton Press).\n 1\nIntroduction  \n \nThe rows of satellite dishes in multiethnic neighbourhoods become the \nultimate symbol of ethnic segregation in the eyes of some local authorities, \nthe inflammatory comments on religious websites are flagged as proof of \nfundamentalism\u2019s expansion in Europe, local Internet cafes are targeted for \nattracting too many young men who use technology and public space for all \nthe wrong reasons. Arguments, which revolve around the potential threats of \ndiasporic and migrant media cultures for European democracy and values, \nbecome increasingly common in popular media and mainstream political \ndiscourses. The fast-growing number of minority media projects and diverse \ntechnology appropriations, combined with the visibility of difference they entail \n(e.g. satellite dishes, different television programmes, Internet cafes, various \nlanguage broadcasts), bring mediation in the heart of the debates on \ninclusion, integration and democracy in Europe. Studying diasporic media \ncultures in their complexity and beyond the cultural singularities and moral \npanics, can help us understand what is different and what is common in the \nEuropean cultural space, what is shared and what is not between minorities \nand majorities; they invite us to think how media cultures might bring together, \nrepresent and include difference and how they might exclude it and lead to \nconflicts between different groups.  \n \nDiasporic media that expand across and beyond Europe, connecting local, \nnational and transnational cultural spaces and populations, and also acting \nautonomously in local, national and transnational contexts, become a key \n 2\narea for thinking of recognition of particularity on one hand and of respect of \nuniversalistic values of democracy and communication across Europe on the \nother. Universalism and particularism become central analytical concepts for \nunderstanding diasporic media cultures beyond binaries and oppositions (e.g. \nethnic segragation vis-\u00e0-vis integration; national vis-\u00e0-vis transnational, \nminority vis-\u00e0-vis majority) and in their actual expressions and implications for \nmulticultural Europe.  \n \nWhat this paper will try to do is to address the continuities and \ninterdependence between diasporic, national and local cultures, minority and \nmajority media and between projects of local, national and transnational \nparticipation. As it will be argued, the reproduction of interpretative binaries \nneither contributes in understanding the complexities of communication \nprocesses, nor helps interpreting the actual cultural (mediated) experience \nwithin multicultural societies. The dialectic interconnection between \nuniversalism and particularism \u2013 as conceptualised in the works of Robertson \n(1992) and Balibar and Wallerstein (1991) \u2013 as well as Hall\u2019s articulation of \ndiff\u00e9rance (2001) and Silverstone\u2019s discussion on contrapuntal cultures \n(2003), become useful and influential starting points for the present analysis. \nEmpirically, this paper draws from an EC-funded research project mapping \ndiasporic media cultures across Europe. This project was conducted between \n2001-2003 within the European Media Technology and Everyday Life Network \n2 (EMTEL2)1 and recorded some key qualitative and quantitative \ncharacteristics of these cultures in their numerical vastness and their diversity.  \n \n 3\nDiasporic media cultures develop in the meeting of local, national and \ntransnational spaces. Diasporic media are of various sizes, level of \nprofessionalism, success and lifespan; they employ different technologies and \nhave different entrepreneurial, cultural and political goals. What they all have \nin common is that they all address particular ethnic, linguistic and\/or religious \ngroups that live within broader and diverse multicultural societies. Their \naudiences are based within localities and nation-states. They are minorities in \nthese nation-states, but they all have some connection (imagined or real) and \nshare a sense of belonging in a larger community spreading beyond national \nboundaries (the diasporic element). It is very important to realise that \ndiasporic media address those audiences in their particularity, but in the \nuniversality of their (imaginary) cultural existence (e.g. Somalis in London \nshare a commonality with Somalis in France; Palestinians in Paris have some \ncommon interests and tastes that relate to their ethnicity). These \ncommonalities are not necessarily real, but even if imagined they can have \nreal consequences. Sharing common cultural repertoires and information, as \nthese appear on satellite Greek television shown across Europe for example, \ncan lead to the (re-)invention of sharing identity and community; this is a case \nof sharing particularity in global scale. Such projects of particularism though \nare not closed and competitive to universalistic values of democracy and \ncommunication, but inevitably depend on the universalism-particularism \ncontinuum. Even when their content promotes insularity and closure, they still \ndepend for their existence on universalistic values ingrained in the modern \nnation-state (that supports them with money and infrastructure), on universal \nhuman rights and the freedom of communication (that protects their rights to \n 4\nexist). This is a key contradiction that has implications for both diasporic \nmedia as projects of community and identity and for the national and \nEuropean policies, which aim to integrate and smoothen difference within \nEuropean mediascapes. This contradiction will be illustrated in the case \nstudies that follow.  \n \nThere are many ambiguities involved in the development and success of \ndiasporic media; but the ambiguous character of such projects and their \nimplications is what makes the universalism-particularism debate relevant as \nan interpretative framework. Three case studies, each originating in one of the \nthree spaces where this research took place and which emerge as the \nsignificant (interconnected) spaces of context for diasporic media cultures, will \nillustrate the proposed articulation of the universalism-particularism \ncontinuum. The local, the national and the transnational form the spatial \ncontext where diasporic groups live and imagine their diasporic space to \nexpand and where the diasporic media cultures are shaped in the production \nof various media and in the consumption and appropriation of different media \nand technologies. The discussion on the three case studies (transnational: the \nother satellite television \u2013 the example of Al Jazeera; national: constructing \nmultiple communities in mediated spaces \u2013 the example of the website New \nVision; local: interpreting the mainstream \u2013 the example of London Greek \nRadio) highlights the implications of diasporic media cultures (and of the \nuniversalism-particularism continuum) for multicultural Europe. \n \n 5\nDefining Universalism and Particularism: Beyond the Binary \n \nWallerstein and Balibar (op.cit.) and Robertson (op.cit.) have challenged the \nbinaries and the antinomies that much of the globalisation literature has \ndepended on (the global and the local; the national and the transnational; \nuniversalism and particularism) in their discussions on the dialectic between \nuniversalism and particularism. Within the binary analyses of globalisation, \ndiasporic media have traditionally fallen into the particularistic category and \nseen as representing ideologies of identity, community, belonging and \ndifference. Yet, such binaries are problematic as they undermine the grey \nareas, the ways centrifugal and centripetal relations of power are formed \nwithin and in the meeting of the particular and the universal (Appadurai 1990, \nRobertson op.cit.) and the actual interdependence of the majority and minority \nand of the global and the local for the construction of their meanings (Miller \n1995, Urry 2000).  \n \nRobertson\u2019s analysis of globalisation involves \u2018the attempt to preserve direct \nattention both to particularity and difference and to universality and \nhomogeneity. It rests largely on the thesis that we are, in the late twentieth \ncentury, witnesses to \u2013 and participants in \u2013 a massive twofold process \ninvolving the interpenetration of the universalization of particularism and the \nparticularization of universalism\u2026\u2019 (op.cit.:100). This process has to do, on \none hand, with the human condition in general, but on the other, with the \nspecific formation and intensification of this interpenetration within recent \nhistory:  \n 6\nRather than simply viewing the theme of universalism as having to do with principles \nwhich can and should be applied to all, and that of particularism as referring to that \nwhich can and should be applied only \u2018locally\u2019, I suggest that the two have become \ntied together as part of a globewide nexus. They have become united in terms of the \nuniversality of the experience and, increasingly, the expectation of particularity, on the \none hand, and the experience and, increasingly, the expectation of universality, on \nthe other. The latter \u2013 the particularization of universalism \u2013 involves the idea of the \nuniversal being given global-human concreteness; while the former \u2013 the \nuniversalization of particularism \u2013 involves the extensive diffusion of the idea that \nthere is virtually no limit to particularity, to uniqueness, to difference and to otherness \n(ibid.: 102). \n \nThis analysis highlights much of the ideological basis of the universalism-\nparticularism continuum within globalisation. The diffusion of such ideologies \nallows space for projects such as diasporic media, which are global in their \nreach but particular in their cultural role. In their vast majority, such projects \ncelebrate particularism within universalism and rely on the assumption that \nthey can function as particular, different and unique projects, because the \npresent condition (of universalism) allows space for all different and unique \nprojects to emerge and develop. For example, the London Greek Radio can \nexist in its uniqueness because the ideological, political and technological \ncontext allows also the London Turkish Radio, Kiss FM and Sunrise Radio to \nexist. Diasporic media cultures are expressions of the universalization of \nparticularism as they are expected to form part of the diverse and multicultural \nmedia settings. They are expressions of the particularization of universalism \nas media are considered and experienced as universal cultural products, \nreferences and communication tools. Diasporic communities expect and seek \nto enjoy media, not only for their particular content and meanings but also as \nthey are universal and globally-shared technologies, means of communication \nand cultural references integrated in everyday life \u2013 like media overall are.  \n  \n 7\nUniversalism and particularism, in their co-existence and interdependence, \nbecome tools within an interpretative framework of understanding the \nconstruction and meanings of diverse mediascapes in multicultural societies \nand across transnational spaces. Thinking of cultural difference and \nideologies of particularism as interweaved in universalistic ideologies can help \nus understand cultural tensions and conflicts as the inevitable struggles that \ntake place in the process of surpassing exclusive and Orientalist \nuniversalisms and exclusive and insular particularisms. This is an invitation to \nbreak off the romanticism and the pathologization of particularism on one \nhand and of the fear and the demonization of universalism as the ideology of \ndomination on the Other.  \n \nThere are different areas in which the universalism-particularism continuum \nbecomes relevant to diasporic media cultures. Most of them are emic and \nrelate to diasporic politics and media practice. While outlining what I \nunderstand to be some of those emic articulations under three headings, it is \na fourth one, an etic one \u2013 the analytical articulation \u2013 which I intend to \ndevelop.  \nThe ideological articulation: As a rule, media rely on ideologies of \nuniversalism \u2013 freedom of communication, democracy, media autonomy \u2013 but \nminority media translate the ideological basis of universalism from a \nparticularistic viewpoint. This means that they adopt ideologies of democracy, \nhuman rights and of freedom of communication in promoting their role as \nrepresentatives of minority and\/or marginalised groups and as agents of \n 8\ndiversity and multiculturalism. They promote this role for both minority \naudiences and the broader society.   \nThe functionalist articulation: This relates to the ideological articulation, but it \nis primarily related to the actual tactics adopted by minority media in their \nattempt to develop and function as institutions, especially in local and national \nscale. Minority media promote themselves as agents of particularism and as \nsources of alternative to the mainstream information and cultural products. \nYet, most of them depend on the universalistic project of nation-states, where \nthey are based, for gaining recognition and support. Nation-states and local \nauthorities recognise and support such projects, not in the name of \nparticularism, but in the name of an inclusive, democratic but singular society \n(i.e. the universalistic values of the modern nation-state).  \nThe experiential articulation: Most minority media rely on diverse sources, \nforms of production and agendas for their outputs. This relates to the nature of \ntheir audiences \u2013 them being embedded in specific national and local spaces, \nbut also being connected with networks across space. Minority audiences \nseek information from the country of origin, the broader diasporic space, as \nwell as from the national and local context where they are embedded. Media \noutput becomes a combination of repertoires reflecting the universalistic and \nparticularistic interests of their global audiences.   \nThe analytical articulation: There is a growing recognition of the urgency of re-\narticulating and re-conceptualising binary oppositions (i.e. the local versus the \nglobal; the national versus the transnational; the universal versus the \nparticular) within the present analysis and understanding of globalisation. The \nanalysis of minority media development and expansion across spatial \n 9\ncontexts allows us to think of the continuities in the global condition and for \nthe implications of the universalism-particularism continuum for multicultural \nsocieties. This last kind of articulation is on the core of this paper and the \ndiscussion on diasporic media cultures\u2019 implications for multicultural Europe. \n \nUniversalism and Particularism in the European Context \nEuropean identity is becoming increasingly identified with a capacity to tolerate considerable \ncultural diversity \u2013 at least of those values that European citizens consider to be most worth \npreserving (K.Reif quoted in Wintle 1996: 5). \n \nThe debate around the cultural richness of Europe is not new; in the \nEuropean Union the differences between ethnic communities have been \nprojected as an advantage of the continent\u2019s pluralism (Gatling 1989).  Yet, \nthis discourse of celebrating diversity has not always been significantly and \nmeaningfully inclusive. As Gatling argues (ibid.), in the EU there is a \ndiscussion on diversity within unity, but such unity can have racist overtones. \nThis is often expressed in the idea of Europeanism and based on the values \nof western democracy. This combination often embraces the dominant status \nquo and relations of power, which cannot but reproduce exclusions.   \n \nWhat many of the dominant ideologies in Europe undermine is the \nheterogeneity as a characteristic of all multicultural societies. Heterogeneity \ncauses a tension in the whole of society, not because itself is a negative \ncondition but because it is being pathologized as a condition. Hobsbawm and \nRanger emphasise the role of invented tradition for sustaining this tension: \n\u2018the invention of tradition is an integral task in the nation-state\u2019s reproduction \nof its continuity. There is then an inherent tension between the invented \n 10\n\u2018heritage\u2019 which roots national identity in history, and the change and \nheterogeneity that characterises the contemporary western Europe nation-\nstate\u2019 (quoted in Husband 1994:6-7). The invented \u2018heritage\u2019 and the myth of \nthe inherited culture characterising the ideology of the nation-state has largely \ninfluenced the way Europe and the European project of (exclusive and \nexclusionary) universalism have been imagined. In similar ways, Pieterse \n(1991) argues that there is a myth about European culture as characterised \nby the inherited civilisation based on the Judaeo-Christian religion, the Greek \nideas of government, philosophy, art and science and the Roman views \nconcerning law. Pieterse challenges this: \u2018The problem is that, in addition to \nbeing chauvinistic, elitist, pernicious and alienating, it is wrong. This myth \nundermines regional cultures and subcultures; it represents elite culture as \ntout court, it denies popular culture, it defines culture in relation to the past \nand it ignores Europe\u2019s multicultural realities (ibid.: 3).  \n \nA crucial question is how Europe is or can be lived. The dominant ideologies \nof Europeanism (Amin 1989, Morley and Robins, 1995) and of universalistic \nvalues of democracy and progress project an image of Europe as a common \nand distinct cultural Home, a Home that excludes and (re-)creates Otherness \nwhen it does not fit in this model of universalism and appears as competing \nparticularlism. But the construction of Europe as singular is as much exclusive \nas it is unreal; Europe is not a Home, but several common homes (Balibar \n1991); it is a space of co-existing and competing cultures, of exclusions and \nstruggles, of multiple cultural formations expanding from the local to the \nnational and the transnational. \n 11\n Europe of Cultural Diversity  \n \nThe population of peoples who at some stage in their history migrated from an \noriginal homeland and settled in a EU country is estimated as high as 8 % of \nthe European Union\u2019s population2. One-seventh of all manual workers in \nGermany and the UK had come as immigrants, and in France, Belgium and \nSwitzerland a quarter of the industrial workforce is formed by immigrants. \nNext to that, millions of people belonging to the older diasporas \u2013 Jewish, \nRoma, Armenians \u2013 have been integral components of the European past and \npresent, even if their experience of Europe has sometimes been of pain and \nprosecution. More recently, hundreds thousands of refugees have been \nsettling in the EU and though these are minimal numbers compared to the \nworld refugee population (e.g. only 3% of world refugees reaches the UK \naccording to the Human Rights Watch 2001) (Georgiou, 2003), refugee \nmobility is central in debates for the future of Europe. Framing this discussion \nin a global context, we have to take into consideration that only 3 % of the \nworld\u2019s refugees reach the UK (ibid.) and that in most EU countries migrant \npopulation does not actually exceed 2 % of the population (COE 1993). Thus, \nthe interest in migrant and diasporic populations is not a mere reflection of a \nnumerical phenomenon.  \n \nMigration is largely the outcome of colonial, postcolonial and indirect \ncolonisation relations between the sending and the receiving countries. \nAccording to Castles et al. (1984), the population in Western Europe \n 12\nincreased by ten million between 1950 and 1975 because of net migration; by \n1984 the migrant labour migrants surpassed 16 million in Western Europe.  \n \nChallenging the Reproduction of Binaries \n \nThe growing diversity in Europe during the twentieth century led to rich and \ntense political and academic debates and to policy changes in the area of \ndiversity and inclusion. Ideologies of universalism became in many ways an \nintegral part of new European universalism, which is more aware of diversity \nand global change. Yet, European multiculturalism, as a rule, is based on the \nrecognition of difference through cultural compartmentalisation (Hall op.cit.). It \nhas rarely recognised or addressed the continuities and the co-existence of \ndifferent cultures as integral parts of what is called European culture as a \nwhole \u2013 this denied continuity is what Hall addressed in his conceptualisation \nof diff\u00e9rance. \u2018The important thing about the concept of diff\u00e9rance is that this \nis not a binary, either\/or form of difference between what is absolutely the \nsame and what is absolutely other or different, but is \u201ca weave of similarities \nand differences which refuse to separate into fixed binary oppositions\u201d\u2019 (Hall \n2001:11). Inviting a similar understanding, Silverstone (2003) emphasises the \ndialectic between the minority and the majority \u2013 and I would add, the dialectic \nbetween the universalistic and the particularistic \u2013 and the different \ncomponents of cultures. While drawing from music, he develops a metaphor \naround the contrapuntal\/the counterpoint: \u2018The important thing as I understand \nit, about counterpoint, is that every theme requires another in order to be \nmeaningful\u2019 (ibid.: 13). He adds: \n 13\n\u2026we can only grasp the meaning of a particular minority media initiative, and assess \nits significance, in its contrapuntal relationship to the presence of other media and \nmedia texts which it addresses, contradicts or seeks to bypass. Likewise we can only \ngrasp the meaning of dominant mainstream media insofar as we register their \ncontrapuntal relationship to the experiences, voices and practices of both the \nincluded and excluded (but still present) minorities. These draw on and in sounds, \nimages and values from outside the boundaries of the mainstream and the national. \nIn so doing, of course, they draw on other mainstreams. And in so doing they also \nchallenge the integrity of the claimed boundaries around European culture and add a \nfurther contrapuntal layer to it, through their relationships to transnational media (ibid.: \n18).  \n \nDominant ideologies of Europeanism and top-down politics of multiculturalism \nusually fail to recognise this dialectic and the continuities, the unstable, \ncreative and tense condition of multicultural societies (Husband 1996, \nKymlicka 1995). This kind of multiculturalism has not been more inclusive \nthan older (or newer) forms of exclusionary or assimilationist ideologies; within \nit, culture and cultural difference function like nature, locking people and \ngroups a priori into genealogy, into a determination (Balibar 1991). Culture \nand identity can reproduce single-dimensional and stereotyping identifications \nof those minorities that are excluded and where dominant discourses of \nmulticulturalism lock them into exclusionary cultural categories as much as \nthey did around race in the past. Thin multiculturalism \u2013 as Modood and \nBerthoud (op.cit) call it \u2013 positions groups of people in self-contained, closed \nand unchanged ethnic categories but fails to recognise diff\u00e9rance and the \nchange and clashes that involve minorities and majorities in different schemes \nand relations. It is this kind of continuities and co-dependence of minority and \nmajority cultures, of multicultural formations and diasporic media cultures that \nthe universalism-particularism continuum help us understand. The \nparticularistic cannot be understood but in its dialogue and co-dependence \nfrom the universal and the other way around. This is what helps us \nunderstand the competing multicultural tendencies within Europe \u2013 the top-\n 14\ndown compartmentalising ones \u2013 and the bottom-up, which inevitably and in \ntheir actual practices, depend on that dialectic.  \n \nThe changing cultural maps, reflected in the diversity of media and the \ndifferent appropriations of communication technologies (e.g. commercial and \ncommunity media, Internet cafes), in new musical genres that different groups \nclaim to be their own but which only exist as products of particularistic themes \nand universalistic forms (e.g. Garage music, Bhangra), and in the sharing of \nairwaves and bits (e.g. multicultural radio, digital television), invite us to think \nof continuities rather than of closures and exclusivities. As the examples \nwhich will be discussed here will indicate, there is a growing co-existence of \nthe universalistic and particularistic cultural claims, aims and outputs and this \ncontinuity, though full of tensions and contradictions, unsettles the perceived \nboundaries and boundedness of the European (cultural) whole.  \n \nBeyond the \u2018Immigration Problem\u2019 and Closure \nThe ideological closure of the dominant European universalism comes with \nthe ascription of a closed particularism, which opposes and threatens \nuniversalism. The verbal recognition of minorities and the ethnicisation of \nsocieties around concepts such as the immigrant, the migrant and the ethnic \nminority reflects and reproduces a political compartmentalisation of Europe \nand ideologies of exclusion based on cultural difference. The word immigrant \nespecially is \u2018a catch-all category, combing ethnic and class criteria, into \nwhich foreigners are dumped indiscriminately, though not all foreigners and \nnot only foreigners\u2019 (Balibar 1991: 221). The immigrant becomes a chief \n 15\ncharacteristic that replaces race in a racist typology; it is a form of racism \nwithout races (ibid.); it is a verbal construction of opposition between Europe \nand the Other. The word immigrant and migrant are becoming increasingly \ninseparable from phrases such as \u2018immigration problem\u2019 and \u2018immigration \ncrisis\u2019. Such discourses that pathologize migration and minorities appear in \nofficial language and often force academic and counter-political discourses to \nadopt a defensive oppositional stand that pathologizes or victimizes \nminorities. Such discourses not only deny individuals and groups their journey \nin time and space, but they also undermine the history of settlement, of \ninclusion and exclusion in specific locales and nation-states; they deny the \nfact that diasporic transnational experience does not only form the mobile \nsubjects\u2019 identities but also the identity of the national subject, this being \nminority or majority \u2013 i.e. the British, not only the Jamaican migrant who \nsettled in Britain.  \n \nAgainst the catch-all category of the immigrant, I draw from approaches within \ntransnationalism and contemporary theorisations of diaspora and refer to \nconcepts such as diasporic and transnational. Transnationalism refers to the \ndevelopment of dense networks across borders (Portes 1997) and to the \nprocesses by which migrant and diasporic communities forge and sustain \nmulti-stranded social relations across geographical, cultural and political \nborders (Basch, Schiller and Blanc-Szanton 1994). Contemporary \ntheorisations of diaspora become useful in thinking of continuity (the changing \nsame, Gilroy 1995), community and attachment in transnational spaces (Hall \n1990, Clifford 1994, Gillespie 1995, Brah 1996, Gilroy 1997). While diaspora \n 16\nis a contested concept \u2013 having at times implied ethnic homogeneity and \nidentity essentialism \u2013 in debates around globalisation, transnationalism and \nmediation, diaspora has been re-appropriated to recognise heterogeneity and \ndiversity, transformation and difference. Gillespie (op.cit.) highlights the shift in \ndiasporic experience through globalisation: \u2018A diasporic perspective \nacknowledges the ways in which identities have been and continue to be \ntransformed through relocation, cross-cultural exchange and interaction. The \nglobalisation of cultures is deeply implicated in this process\u2019 (ibid.: 7).  \n \nMobility and movement of populations and individuals and the changing \ncultural maps, reflected in flows, as much as in language \u2013 in adjectives rather \nthan nouns such as diasporic, instead of the diaspora; migratory, instead of \nthe migrant \u2013 challenge such closures of culture and cultural \ncompartmentalisation. Thinking through the migratory and diasporic journey in \ntime and space, the experiences of deterritorialisation and reterrotorialisation, \nthe informal, cultural and communicational next to the formal and economic \nencounters, the continuities and discontinuities and the breaking off singular \nand close cultural and ethnic categories, invites an analysis of particularity \nand diff\u00e9rance and of meanings of mediated experience rather than of \nessentialist ethnic distinctiveness.   \n \nThe Diasporic (Mediated) Space \nBoth place and space are important elements for understanding diaspora, \ndiasporic dislocation (Dayan 1999), relocation, the processes of \ndeteritorialization and reterritorialization that characterise the real and the \n 17\nimagined diasporic experience. Diasporic minorities live within specific \nlocales, national and transnational spaces. The social interaction and \ncommunication within the diasporic communities, among dispersed sections \nof the same diaspora and beyond the limits of a diasporic community, all take \nplace in spaces. Some of those spaces (also defined as ethnoscapes and \nmediascapes by Appadurai op.cit.) are grounded in very specific places \u2013 \nsuch as the neighbourhood \u2013 while others exist virtually and in non-places \n(Urry op.cit.). Social interaction and relations are no longer dependent on \nsimultaneous spatial co-presence, there are also relations developing with the \n\u2018absent other\u2019 through new communications; when this happens, experience \nof time and space becomes distanciated (Giddens op.cit.) and diasporic \ncommunities can break off the specificities of space and extend their \ncommunication potentials. In this context, there is less and less a possibility \nfor a neat equation between culture, community and geography (Gillespie \nop.cit.) and more space for \u2018imaginative geography and history\u2019 (Said 1985). \nThe connections and relations of \u2018absence\u2019 between places are greatly \nstrengthened by modern communication systems, which have augmented a \nsense of diasporic awareness. \n \nDiasporic communities sustain and partly depend for their communal shared \nsense of identity on transnational communications. But the national and local \ncontext where diasporic populations live is equally important for the \nconstruction of meanings of community and identity, especially as inclusion, \nexclusion and participation in the broader societies are largely grounded in the \nnational and local space: nation-states and locales have some distinct \n 18\nhistorical, cultural and political characteristics. Needless to say, this leads to \ncertain limitations in analysis \u2013 such as the one which follows, that aims at \ndrawing themes and characteristics that surpass the specific. At the same \ntime, the awareness of spatial dialectics informs this analysis and the \nconstruction of themes.  \n \nDiasporic Media Cultures: Spatial, Cultural and Ideological Continuums \n \nA cross-European research project on diasporic media cultures, which \nemployed a series of methods, produced both a comprehensive map of \ndiasporic media cultures and a set of themes that address meanings and \nimplications of these cultures for multicultural Europe. Here, one theme from \neach of the three spaces which form the context of diasporic media cultures \u2013 \nthe local, the national and the transnational \u2013 is discussed for illustrating their \nrole in shaping politics of difference and particularity, even, and actually while, \nbeing embedded in ideologies of universalism.  \n \nTransnational: the Other satellite television \u2013 The example of Al Jazeera \nSatellite television is homologous to the transnationalism of diasporic \nexperience. Satellite television has radically altered transnational \nmediascapes as it has allowed simultaneity and richness in exchange and \ncirculation of the images and texts consumed across diasporic populations \nacross the globe. With satellite technology, television produced in the \nhomeland has become available across the globe. Dispersed audiences \nwatch the same news and the same comedies, they know what the weather is \n 19\nlike and what kind of music is popular in their country of origin. At the same \ntime, new satellite television channels, which are not rooted in any one \nhomeland, but which become significant for identity and community as they \naddress transnational audiences in their particularity (e.g. Al Jazeera; \nMedTV), become important players in global communications. The \nconnectedness, simultaneity and sharing of common images and narratives \nacross boundaries reinforce and remind dispersed population of the existence \nof a transnational community which is \u2013 potentially \u2013 inclusive of all the spread \ngroups around the globe. On one hand, satellite television reflects the \ndiasporic project of sustaining cultural particularity. On the other, diasporic \nsatellite television has managed to develop because of the present climate of \nfree communications, the promotion of technological innovation and of \nliberalisation of telecommunications. The relation between the \nmainstream\/universalising and the particular\/minority is reciprocal here - \ndiasporic satellite culture is not just mimicking the mainstream and globalising \nappropriations of satellite technology; it is also actively (even if sometimes \ninvisibly) shaping European and transnational satellite cultures. \n  \nIn many European countries, diasporic communities have introduced and\/or \nincreased the popularity of satellite television. The density of satellite dishes \nand cable television subscription is higher in migrant households compared to \nAustrian households, note B\u00f6se, Haberfellner and Koldas (2002). Similar \nfindings appear in countries with large migrant communities (e.g. Germany, \nGreece). According to the mapping of satellite diasporic channels, there are at \nleast 200 diasporic satellite channels available across the European Union \n 20\nand the numbers are increasing with fast paste. Turkish satellite channels are \nthe most numerous and diverse; they include dozens of channels produced in \nTurkey and abroad, some of them state-controlled and others commercial. \nAnother group of channels, with speedy increase in numbers, are those \noriginating in the former Soviet Union countries and which in their vast \nmajority are commercial enterprises addressing the new migrant communities \noriginating in these countries and now being spread across the EU. A third \ngroup worth mentioning are the Arabic channels, which increase in numbers, \npopularity, but which are also increasingly recognised as players in global \ncommunications by western governments and other major media players.  \n \nAccess to diasporic satellite television within Europe is becoming an area of \npolitical decisions with unpredictable consequences. Local authorities in \ngrowing number of EU countries (e.g. Austria, Denmark, The Netherlands) \nhave introduced restrictions in the installation of satellite dishes which allow \nthe reception of diasporic channels. Such restrictions are problematic in many \nways, especially as they reinforce a sense of Otherness among minorities and \nreproducing oppositional ideologies between the diasporic (particularistic) and \nthe national (universalistic) cultural projects. Yet, and as the popularity of \nsatellite television among diasporic populations is growing next to the \npopularity of all satellite channels this opposition is challenged. As empirical \nresearch has shown, minority populations consume diasporic media, but at \nthe same time they consume mainstream media. More than competing, their \ndiverse media consumption is complex and engages diasporic populations \nwith a variety of texts and cultural products, which they consume more \n 21\ncritically (Gillespie op.cit., Georgiou 2001, Aksoy and Robins 2000). The \nengagement of diasporic audiences with satellite television reflects the ways \nmainstream and minority media interweave and how it is more about \ncontinuity between the particular and the universal rather than about \ncompetition.  \n \nThe example of Al Jazeera reflects this continuum, even if has been used in \nsome political debates for illustrating arguments on the opposition between \nuniversalism and particularism. Al Jazeera, an Arabic satellite television \nstation extensively consumed by transnational Arabic audiences, but unknown \nuntil recently to the west, has recently entered the mainstream mediascapes \nand everyday political discourse as a powerful player. After 911, Al Jazeera, \nwhich is based in Qatar, broadcasted a series of exclusive monologues of Bin \nLaden and exclusive reports from Afghanistan when no other medium had \naccess in the country. Overnight, Al Jazeera became one of the most broadly \nquoted media, visibly altering the balance in global communication settings. \nThe US Secretary of State Colin Powell demanded of the Emir of Qatar that \nthe station stopped the broadcasts of the Bin Laden videos, while the station\u2019s \nEuropean Brussels-based editor Ahmad Kamel found himself detained and \ndeported by the Swiss authorities on October 14 (Journalist 2002).  \n \nThe power of Al Jazeera that brought it in the centre of global publicity is \ndirectly connected to its ability to cross boundaries and surpass the \nbroadcasting restrictions of nation-states. Al Jazeera\u2019s content and access to \nits content are difficult to be controlled though such attempts have not only \n 22\nbeen expressed by the US, but also in the Arab world (ibid.). However, Al \nJazeera\u2019s popularity is increasing fast: it now has 50 million viewers around \nthe world. This is a station that addresses an Arabic transnational community. \nThis large audience turns to Al Jazeera for two main reasons, as relevant \nresearch indicates (El Nawawy and Iskandar 2002). On one hand, it is a \nstation that proposes an alternative to the mainstream western media agenda, \nwhich has alienated many of the Arabic populations living in the west. On the \nother hand, Arabic audiences turn to Al Jazeera more often than they turn to \nArabic official and state-controlled media as this station challenges the \nrestrictions and censorship imposed by most Arabic governments. The \nposition of this station\u2019s audiences cannot but be understood as a dialectic \nand critical interweaving of the universal and the particular. From their position \nin the west, Al Jazeera\u2019s audiences become critical to the restrictions imposed \nto free communication by some Arabic countries. At the same time, this \nstation\u2019s audiences turn to Al Jazeera for receiving what they perceive as \ninformation and entertainment that is of particular interest to Arabic \naudiences.   \n \nNational: Constructing Multiple Communities in Mediated Spaces \u2013 The \nexample of New Vision  \nChallenging the binaries between minorities and majorities or between \nuniversalism and particularism is not only a matter of interpretation of the \nrelation between different media; many specific projects become by \nthemselves spaces for the expression of such continuities, dialogue and \nnegotiation. The case of New Vision (www.newvision.org.uk), an Ethiopian \n 23\ninitiative on the web, is very characteristic as a challenge to singular \nboundaries and to the separation of media between mainstream and minority. \nThe New Vision \u2013 The Independent Refugee News and Information Service \u2013 \naddresses primarily the refugee community in the UK, but also the Ethiopian \ndiaspora and a community of refugee rights\u2019 activists in Britain and beyond. \nThe website campaigns for refugee rights and includes up-to-date information \nabout events and activities in this area; at the same time, it has a space \nespecially devoted to news and information regarding the Ethiopian diaspora \nand a broader social space, with news on refugee everyday life, job \nadvertising and updates on asylum seeker politics and policies. Positive \nrepresentation of refugees, which challenges their representation as a \nproblem, is the declared mission of New Vision. This agenda becomes \nprominent, for example, in an article about the contribution of the migrants \nemployed as nurses and doctors in the British society and in frequent reports \non refugee artists. New Vision constantly reminds its audiences \u2013 refugees, \nmigrant and members of a support community \u2013 of the possibilities for an \ninclusive, diverse society and of a mediated space which is not exclusionary \nand exclusive, but which can actually fit and include issues of identity and \ncommunity, as much as it can present and promote agendas that relate to the \nuniversalistic project of the (multiethnic) state. New Vision calls itself \u2018The \nVoice for the Voiceless\u2019 and it defines its mission as a contribution to \nharmonious integration in multicultural Britain \n(http:\/\/www.newvision.org.uk\/mission.htm), while at the same time it claims to \nbe one of the most popular media spaces for the Ethiopian diaspora.  \n \n 24\nThere are a few dimensions of New Vision that are interesting and important \nin the context of the present discussion. Firstly, New Vision is a case that \nillustrates the development of a new form of community space. On one hand, \nthis is a space for the multiethnic community of refugee (and its supporters) \nand campaigns that relate to democratic participation and inclusion in the \nnation-state. On the other hand, it is a diasporic project for the Ethiopian \ncommunity. In New Vision, the boundaries between the ethnic and the \nmultiethnic are negotiated. The potential for the co-existence of multiple flows \nof communication within an alternative mediated space reflects the possibility \nfor developing a more inclusive and dialectical form of multiculturalism. This \nexample also indicates very clearly how the Internet, more than any other \nmedium, can become the space where new migrant communities lacking the \nnumbers, the resources and the know-how, can develop alternative mediated \nspaces. For transnational communities, such as the Ethiopian, the immediacy \nand the access to community information and communication on the Internet \nreflect the visibility that a community needs for surviving \u2013 in its connectivity \nand its imagining. Furthermore, this case indicates how a website can \nbecome an active political forum and a point of reference for minorities and \nactivists, when their agenda is excluded from mainstream discourses. The \nspecific website is indeed a point of reference and a source of news on \nrefugee-relevant information, as well as a visible and vocal expression of \npolitical pressure. New Vision is not only a site of political campaigning; it is \nalso a social \u2013 even if virtual \u2013 space and a space of positive \nrefugee\/Ethiopian representation. Sites such as this highlight aspects of \nmultiethnic societies undermined in mainstream media and mainstream public \n 25\ndiscourses. Examples such as the presentation of migrant doctors and \nnurses, discussions on the long European history of cultural diversity, the \npromotion of refugee art projects and other positive representations of migrant \nand refugee everyday life reflect an alternative to the binaries and to divisions \nbetween projects for identity and community on one hand and projects for \nparticipation and inclusion on the other.  \n \nLocal: Interpreting the Mainstream \u2013 The example of London Greek Radio \nMuch of the success of diasporic media across Europe depends on the \ncontinuing loyalty of the migrant generation upon such media. This loyalty is \nmore complex than this space allows discussing, but one of the elements \nworth addressing in the context of this paper is that of minority languages. \nMany members of diasporic and migrant groups still have low skills in the \nmajority language and feel more comfortable with their native language. The \nlevel of language skills has multiple consequences for economic, cultural and \npolitical participation in European societies and for gaining access and \nunderstanding of information about services, rights (e.g. social benefits, \ntraining, jobs) and political developments in the country of residence. Many of \nthe local and national minority media pay special attention to this area, \npublishing and broadcasting such information in minority languages and in \npopular and simple language that makes it accessible to members of a group \nwith low literacy and low mainstream language skills. One such example is \nthe weekly programme on social benefits broadcasted on the London Greek \nRadio (LGR). This programme is presented in the Greek language and it aims \nat popularising information about benefits offered by the state and local \n 26\nauthorities. The programme also encourages the listeners to get in touch with \nthe producer and presenter (a Greek working for social services) and to seek \nanswers to their specific concerns. Many listeners of LGR mention this \nprogramme as an accountable and constant source of information (Georgiou \n2001). As they argue, it is a source of information they trust and which speaks \ntheir own language. Such programmes enforce the feeling that they can \nparticipate in the broader society, while being keeping their diasporic \nparticularity.   \n \nIt is the local diasporic media that play this role most often. Being usually \nsemi-professional and set up by members of local diasporic groups, they \nreflect many of the characteristics of the groups they address. The local \nmedia adopt the role of the mediator of mainstream information to the \nparticular group for a number of reasons. Often they are obliged by the state \nthat licences (and often funds) them to do so. But more importantly, in \nincluding information that relates to the mainstream and which goes beyond \nparticular information and entertainment products (e.g. news from Greece and \nCyprus, Greek pop music), they reflect the complexity of their audiences. \nDiasporic audiences are positioned in complex cultural settings, which include \nparticular connections and a sense of belonging, but also imply engagement \nin universalistic projects of communication and (struggles for) participation in \nmulticultural societies.   \n \nConclusions  \n \n 27\nThe three case studies above was an attempt to illustrate the construction of \ndiasporic particularism, which is neither sustained in binary oppositions \nbetween the mainstream and the minorities, the national and the transnational \nnor in media systems that are closed systems by themselves and for \nthemselves. The themes discussed above invite us to understand diasporic \nmedia cultures as an interplay of diff\u00e9rance:  \n\u2026every concept and meaning is inscribed in a chain or a system within which it refers \nto the others, to other concepts and meanings by means of the systematic play of \ndifferences\u2026Its political value cannot be essentialized; that is to say, it can\u2019t be \nsnatched out of the play of similarity and differences which are constantly \nconstructing it, it can only be defined in relation to all the other forces which are \ntrying, as it were, to define the cultural sphere at that moment (Hall 2001: 11).  \n \nThis play of diff\u00e9rance and of non-closure relates (i.) to the character of \ndiasporic cultures as changing, unfixed, contested and non-singular; (ii.) to the \ncontinuities and the dialectic interrelation between spatial positionings; and \n(iii.) to the interweaving of the ideologies of particularism \u2013 i.e. identity and \ncommunity \u2013 and of universalism \u2013 i.e. media culture, communication, \nconstruction and participation in democratic (mediated) spaces.  \n \nThe shape of diasporic media cultures, as illustrated in the context of the \nuniversalism-particularism continuum, has a series of implications for \nmulticultural Europe:  \n- Different minority groups raise issues of recognition and of alternative \npolitics within universalism. Like the feminist movement argued and \nfought for recognition of difference and for alternative forms of \norganisation in the name of the universal values of equality, inclusion \nand democracy, similarly other minority groups aim at re-shaping the \nagenda of universalism. In similar ways to the feminists, many \n 28\ndiasporic and ethnic minority media projects argue that equality is not \nbased on sameness or assimilation, but actually on the celebration and \npromotion of difference. Such minority movements propose forms of \nparticularization of universalism and reshape the universalistic \nEuropean values.  \n- The development and success of minority diasporic media are, at least \npartly, expressions of reaction and resistance to the universalistic \nideologies of the nation-state. As Robertson argues, the modern state \nsystem is a model of Gesellschaft, based on concentration of power, \nbureaucracy and hierarchical structures. This model leads to alienation \nand suppression of cultural expressions that threaten the power and \ndominance of the state. Projects, such as those of minority or \ncommunity media, challenge the alienation and suppression of free \nexpression and creativity that takes places through the mechanisms of \ncontrol adopted by the nation-state and propose alternatives. These \nalternatives develop, either on the basis of what people have in \ncommon against concentrated power\/the state \u2013 i.e. their common \nhumanity \u2013 or on the basis of ideologies seeing one specific \nparticularism as more meaningful than the all-inclusive modern state. \nBoth examples can be seen in diasporic media projects \u2013 the first in \ncommunity creative projects and the second in fundamentalist projects. \nBoth expressions of particularism emerge through processes of \nmirroring\/continuity\/interpretation of universalism. A real consequence \nfor Europe is the tension between minority media and the European \nstates. The universalistic project of the nation-state implies inclusion \n 29\nand participation of all citizens. At the same time, the emergence of \nalternative cultures that are not contained or controlled by the state are \npotential threats to its power and integrity. European state policies in \nthis area are full of contradictions as, on one hand there is an attempt \nto include\/assimilate minority media and, on the other, to \ncontrol\/suppress their power and influence. \n- The Orientalism thesis (Said op.cit.) has been very influential for \nthinking of the othering of the non-western subjects and cultures and \nfor the (re-)production of relations of power between the west and the \nrest. The other side of Orientalism, which is understudied, relates to the \ninterpretations of the west by the rest, especially through tense global \nencounters (Robertson op.cit.). Minority media cultures bring this \ninterpretation of the west by the rest within the western societies \u2013 \nwithin the limits of Europe. The singularity of the European \nuniversalism (and its Orientalism) is challenged from within. \n \nThe development of diasporic media cultures across Europe is about flows \nand scapes that cut across Europe vertically and horizontally and which \nexpand beyond it; it is also about vertical and horizontal schemes of \ndifference \u2013 of diff\u00e9rance, not the binary \u2013 across diasporic communities and \nabout struggles of representation and power within and beyond the specific \ngroups. Recognising and acknowledging the development of emergent \nnetworks and flows that challenge the mainstream is not about celebrating \nparticularism, diversity and cultural richness alone. Observing diasporic \nidentities and communities in their spatial continuity and as they are sustained \n 30\nprimarily through mediated networks and flows and in the merging and \nemerging of ideologies of universalism and particularism has implications both \nfor our thinking of multicultural societies as diverse societies (beyond the hype \nand thin multiculturalism and in relation to tensions and conflicts) and for our \nthinking of transnational media cultures as the outcome of the universalism-\nparticularism continuum.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nI am indebted to R.Silverstone for his comments and advice during the \nconduct of the research on diasporic media cultures across Europe and \nduring the development of this paper.
