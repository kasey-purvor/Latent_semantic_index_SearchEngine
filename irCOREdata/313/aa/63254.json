Models of the dynamics of ocean ecosys-\ntems are being developed to examine the controls on upper ocean carbon budgets (e.g. Steinberg\net al., 2001). However, within ocean ecosystem models developed for analysing carbon bud-\ngets, zooplankton are often represented as single compartments with no structure based on the\nmodel of Fasham et al. (1990). This may be sufficient to represent small, fast growing micro-\nzooplankton (e.g. Popova et al., 2002), but is not a realistic representation for zooplankton that\nhave complex life cycles, live 1, 2 or more years and may undergo vertical migrations of over\n1000 m and horizontal movements of over 1000 km. For such species more complex models are\nrequired that consider the changes in biological\u2013physical process interactions during develop-\nment. For some of the well-studied zooplankton species of the North Atlantic detailed models\nof the life cycles are being developed. For example, population models of Calanus finmarchicus\nare being coupled with general circulation models to examine the biological\u2013physical interac-\ntions during their life cycle (Zakardjian et al., 2003; Heath et al., 2004; Speirs et al., 2005).\nDeveloping more realistic models for other ocean ecosystems that include the life-cycles of key\nzooplankton species and their interactions with the physical environment is a key goal of global\nocean ecosystem research.\n\u0000\nCorresponding author.\nEmail address: seth@bas.ac.uk (S. E. Thorpe).\n2\nIn the Southern Ocean, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana) is a key species in the food\nweb being a major grazer of phytoplankton (Atkinson et al., 2001) and a major prey item of\nmany of the seal and seabird species that occur in such large numbers in the region (Croxall\net al., 1988). However, krill are not homogeneously distributed in the Southern Ocean and\noccur in much higher densities across the Scotia Sea and around the continent than in other\nopen ocean regions (Marr, 1962; Atkinson et al., 2004; Siegel, 2005, Fig. 1). Within these\nregions the distribution and abundance of krill show marked seasonal and interannual variation\n(e.g. Brierley et al., 1997; Loeb et al., 1997; Siegel et al., 1998), and although there are detailed\nstudies of local dynamics (Murphy et al., 1998, 2004a), there is limited understanding of the\nfactors controlling their distribution in oceanic regions. Krill grow to approximately 15 mm in\nlength before their first winter (see Fig. 1 of Hofmann and Lascara, 2000) and do not mature\nuntil they are at least 2 years old (Cuzin-Roudy, 1987a,b; Siegel and Loeb, 1994), during which\ntime they will have overwintered twice. During the early summer periods the juvenile krill\nwill be transported in the ocean currents as largely passive particles. Larger, adult krill are more\nmobile and swimming will become more important as they can maintain speeds of 10\u201315 cm s \u0000\n\u0001\n(Kils, 1982). However, in oceanic regions the ocean current flows are likely to dominate their\ndistribution during summer. A number of field and modelling studies have examined the role of\nadvection by ocean currents in the distribution of Antarctic krill (Hofmann et al., 1998; Murphy\net al., 1998, 2004a,b; Fach et al., 2002, 2006; Thorpe et al., 2002, 2004; Fach and Klinck, 2006).\nThe modelling work has focussed on the summer period in the Scotia Sea and has shown that\nocean currents can connect krill populations at the regional scale.\nHowever, ocean circulation is not the only physical factor that can affect distribution of Antarc-\ntic krill. Sea ice is a key overwintering habitat for krill providing both access to a vital food\nsource and refuge from predators. Observations of larval and juvenile krill in close association\nwith sea ice, both feeding on algae on its undersurface and taking refuge in channels within\nthe ice, are numerous (Marr, 1962; Nast, 1982; Daly and Macauley, 1988; Marschall, 1988;\nStretch et al., 1988; Daly, 1990; Melnikov and Spiridonov, 1996; Frazer et al., 1997). There\nis also some evidence, both from direct observations (Marschall, 1988; Daly, 1990; Brierley\net al., 2002) and indirectly from stomach contents of higher predators (Ainley et al., 1987; Daly\n3\nand Macauley, 1988; Ichii and Kato, 1991), of adult krill inhabiting the under-ice environment.\nThe seasonal pattern of advance and retreat of Antarctic sea ice results in an areal change from\n4 \u0000 10\n\u0001\nkm\n\u0002\nin austral summer to 20 \u0000 10\n\u0001\nkm\n\u0002\nin austral winter (Harms et al., 2001). Sea\nice drift acts to change the ice distribution. Sea ice moves differently to the underlying ocean;\nice motion is generally determined by a combination of wind, ocean currents and internal stress\n(Steele et al., 1997), with wind dominating on short timescales (Thorndike and Colony, 1982).\nTherefore, because of the close association of krill with sea ice, the interaction of krill with the\nsea ice will be important for their subsequent distribution.\nInterannual variability in Antarctic sea ice extent (Murphy et al., 1995; White and Peterson,\n1996) has been related to population dynamics of krill at the Antarctic Peninsula by affecting\nrecruitment success (Siegel and Loeb, 1995; Quetin and Ross, 2001, 2003). The shelf areas\naround the Antarctic Peninsula are key spawning areas for krill (e.g. Marr, 1962) and are be-\nlieved to act as source regions for krill populations downstream (Marr, 1962; Brinton, 1985;\nSiegel, 1992). The island of South Georgia, lying north of the sea ice zone in the northeast\nScotia Sea, is one such area. Influx to South Georgia is particularly important since the island\nsupports large numbers of breeding higher marine predators whose main food source is Antarc-\ntic krill. Although krill are capable of reproducing around South Georgia, the eggs and larvae\ndo not contribute to the South Georgia krill populations (Tarling et al., 2006). Instead, the South\nGeorgia krill populations are believed to be maintained by influx from source regions upstream\nof the island such as the Antarctic Peninsula and the Weddell Sea (e.g. Marr, 1962; Everson,\n1977; Brinton, 1985; Maslennikov and Solyankin, 1988; Siegel, 1992).\nBecause of these advective connections between krill populations, sea ice variability has eco-\nlogical impacts outside the sea ice zone. The fluctuations in recruitment success at the Antarctic\nPeninsula, related to sea ice variability, have been noted to affect the South Georgia krill pop-\nulations (Murphy et al., 1998; Reid et al., 1999; Murphy and Reid, 2001). Biomass estimates\nfluctuate in concordance across the Scotia Sea (Brierley et al., 1999) suggesting large-scale\nconnections. In addition, krill transport to South Georgia has been linked to winter sea ice in\nmodelling studies (Murphy et al., 1998; Ward et al., 2002; Murphy et al., 2004a). Material ar-\n4\nriving at South Georgia originates from under the sea ice a few months prior to arrival at South\nGeorgia. This suggests that variability in the extent and drift of the sea ice in the Scotia Sea may\naffect influx to the South Georgia region.\nWith this research, we advance the earlier advection modelling by incorporating the effect of\nsea ice motion on transport pathways at circumpolar and regional scales. A Lagrangian parti-\ncle tracking scheme is used to simulate trajectories in velocity fields with and without sea ice\nmotion included to examine the impact of the association of krill with sea ice. We use output\nfrom a global numerical ocean circulation model, OCCAM, to provide ocean current informa-\ntion combined with satellite-derived sea ice motion data. Differences between the upper level\noceanic motion and that of the sea ice are evident in the model results. Depending on locality,\nthe sea ice acts as either a retention or dispersal mechanism which generates alternative con-\nnections between the circumpolar krill population centres. Finally, we investigate the impact\nof temporal variability in the sea ice and ocean datasets on transport to South Georgia. Vari-\nability in the sea ice motion enhances variability in influx to South Georgia and it is shown\nthat anomalous sea ice conditions open up additional source regions for the krill populations at\nSouth Georgia.\n2 Data & Methods\n2.1 Advection scheme\nTo determine transport pathways, we use the Lagrangian particle tracking scheme described\nby Murphy et al. (2004a). The advection scheme is a second order Runge-Kutta scheme. It\nhas two dimensions spatially and uses time-varying velocity input. Horizontal resolution is\n\u0001\n\u0000\n\u0001\n\u0000\n\u0001\n\u0000\n\u0001\n, determined by the velocity fields (described below). The components of velocity in\nthe longitude and latitude directions ( \u0002 , \u0003 ) at the particle\u2019s position are bilinearly interpolated\nfrom the four surrounding grid points. A no slip condition is applied at land boundaries. To\nensure stability of the scheme, a timestep of 2.4 hours is used which satisfies the Courant-\n5\nFriedrich-Lewy stability criterion. Diffusion is not treated explicitly within the particle tracking\nscheme.\n2.2 Ocean velocity data\nThe ocean velocity fields used in the particle tracking scheme are from the 6 hourly wind forced\nrun of the Ocean Circulation and Climate Advanced Modelling Project (OCCAM) model (Webb\net al., 1998; Saunders et al., 1999; Webb and de Cuevas, 2003). OCCAM is a global, eddy-\npermitting \u0000 level primitive equation model of the Bryan-Cox-Semtner type and includes a free\nsurface (Killworth et al., 1991). The version used in this research has a horizontal resolution\nof\n\u0001\n\u0000\n\u0001\n\u0000\n\u0001\n\u0000\n\u0001\nwhich gives a longitudinal resolution of 21.3 km at the northernmost latitude of\nour study region (40 \u0001 S) decreasing to 5.8 km at the southernmost latitude (78 \u0001 S); latitudinal\nresolution remains constant at 27.8 km. OCCAM has 36 levels in the vertical with thickness\nranging from 20 m at the surface to 255 m at depth. The run of OCCAM that we use has been\nforced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts\u2019 6-hourly reanalysed wind\ndataset and relaxed to climatological temperature and salinity data (Levitus and Boyer, 1994;\nLevitus et al., 1994). At the time of our investigations, output from OCCAM was available over\nthe period January 1993\u2013November 2000. OCCAM simulates the circulation of the Scotia Sea\nreasonably well (Thorpe et al., 2005) and has been used in other modelling studies of this kind\n(Ward et al., 2002; Murphy et al., 2004a).\nOur advection investigations use two different ocean velocity datasets derived from OCCAM\nvelocity output. To examine circumpolar connections, we use a multi-year monthly mean (cli-\nmatological) velocity dataset, calculated from the monthly mean velocity fields from the 8 year\nperiod of OCCAM output. The second part of our research, an investigation into the effects of\ntemporal variability in the Scotia Sea, uses time-varying (i.e. not annually-repeating) monthly\nmean OCCAM velocity output. Both studies use a depth-weighted mean velocity of the upper\n182 m of the water column (levels 1\u20137 of OCCAM) following Murphy et al. (2004a). The ma-\njority of krill biomass is found in this depth range in the summer season (Siegel, 1986; Miller\nand Hampton, 1989; Watkins et al., 2004).\n6\n2.3 Sea ice motion data\nThe version of OCCAM that we use for the ocean velocity datasets did not incorporate a sea\nice model. Since modelled sea ice motion data were not available from OCCAM to go with the\nocean velocity output at the time of our study, we instead use Polar Pathfinder 25 km sea ice\nmotion vectors provided by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (Fowler, 2003). The sea ice\nmotion vectors were regridded onto the OCCAM\n\u0001\n\u0000\n\u0001\n\u0000\n\u0001\n\u0000\n\u0001\nhorizontal grid and are used in two\nforms. Firstly, multi-year monthly means (climatology) were calculated from the monthly mean\ndata (available 1978\u20132003) for the circumpolar transport study. To avoid aliasing the high speed\nmotion at the ice-edge into an unrealistically broad zone when calculating the sea ice motion\nclimatology, we enforced a cut-off point of 12 data points (i.e. 50% of the available monthly\nmeans) in each cell. That is, only cells with 12 or more data points had a mean calculated;\nthe remaining cells were set to zero ice motion. Secondly, the annually-varying, monthly mean\n(non-climatological) ice motion fields were used for the Scotia Sea variability analysis.\n2.4 Combined sea ice\/ocean velocity data\nTo incorporate the effects of sea ice motion on the simulated particle trajectories, we use com-\nbined sea ice\/ocean motion velocity fields in the advection scheme. In both velocity datasets\ndescribed above (circumpolar and Scotia Sea), ocean velocities in areas of sea ice cover (de-\nfined as those grid cells that have non-zero sea ice motion) are replaced by the corresponding\nsea ice motion data. In this way, the computational efficiency of the advection scheme is not\ncompromised; the program need only read in these combined datasets and does not have to\nmake decisions about when to use ice motion in preference to ocean motion.\nAll the monthly velocity fields (whether climatological or monthly mean) are modified accord-\ning to Killworth (1996) before use in the advection scheme. This avoids errors associated with\nstraightforward linear interpolation between time-varying mean velocity fields.\n7\n2.5 Model domains and particle releases\nThe circumpolar transport experiment has a circumpolar model domain with open boundaries\nin the north at 40 \u0001 S and in the south at 78 \u0001 S. The northern boundary was defined to lie generally\nnorth of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current while the southern boundary is defined by the extent\nof OCCAM. Particles were released on a regular grid with horizontal resolution of 2 \u0001 in latitude\nand 4 \u0001 in longitude to begin with, and then from areas of krill abundance based on the data in\nFig. 1(b). Particles were released on the 1st day of January, April, July and October into the\nclimatological (annually-repeating) velocity fields and tracked for a maximum of 3 years in the\ntwo different velocity datasets. Once particles leave the model domain via either of the open\nboundaries they do not reenter the simulation. The general patterns from the seasonal releases\nare very similar and we therefore present only the January release results, the approximate mid-\nmonth of the spawning season of Antarctic krill around the continent (e.g., Spiridonov, 1995).\nThe Scotia Sea variability investigation covers a study region comprising 50\u201370 \u0001 S, 80\u201320 \u0001 W.\nParticles are released on a grid with horizontal resolution of 0.5 \u0001 latitude by 1 \u0001 longitude in the\narea bounded by 59\u201369 \u0001 S, 75\u201335 \u0001 W. This release pattern was chosen to cover the source region\nof particles that reach South Georgia based on preliminary trajectories and as such includes the\nwestern Antarctic Peninsula area, the southern Scotia Sea and the northwestern Weddell Gyre,\nareas of known krill spawning activity (e.g. Marr, 1962). Particles that leave the simulation at an\nopen boundary of the model domain are assumed lost to the system and do not reenter. Particles\nwere released on the 1st day of each month over the period July 1993\u2013May 1999 and tracked\nfor a maximum of one year. Variability in the results was quantified by examining transport to\nSouth Georgia, as defined by the number of particles entering a predefined region around the\nisland.\n8\n3 Results\n3.1 Mean circumpolar circulation\nTo examine the mean ocean circulation simulated by OCCAM, particles were tracked in the\nclimatological velocity fields for 10 years [Fig. 2(a)]. The trajectories show the general circu-\nlation of the upper \u0000 200 m of the Southern Ocean in OCCAM. The modelled circulation is in\ngood agreement with observations (e.g. Gordon et al., 1978; Orsi et al., 1995) with the banded\nstructure of the eastward-flowing ACC, westward Antarctic Coastal Current and cyclonic gyres\nof the Weddell and Ross Seas all reproduced.\nTo compare, the mean sea ice motion averaged over the available data is shown in Fig. 2(b).\nEmery et al. (1997) described the mean motion of Antarctic sea ice based on an average calcu-\nlated over a shorter period of time and the same general circulation can be noted here. Westward\nsea ice motion close to the continent is connected to eastward motion associated with the ACC\nby areas of northward sea ice movement, particularly from the main coastal embayments of the\nWeddell and Ross Seas and Prydz Bay.\n3.2 Differences between circumpolar ocean only and sea ice\/ocean trajectories\nTo examine the differences in particle advection that arise from the inclusion of sea ice motion in\nthe advection scheme, the distance between end points of the simulated trajectories following\nadvection in the two velocity datasets (with and without sea ice motion) after one year was\ncalculated (Fig. 3). 50% of the particles were affected by sea ice in the first year of advection\nwhich resulted in different trajectories in the two advection runs [as defined by the particles\nbeing more than 1 grid cell apart (0.25 \u0001 ) in either longitude or latitude; Fig. 3]. Particles that\ndo not come into contact with sea ice have the same trajectories in both advection runs since in\nareas not covered by sea ice the two velocity datasets are identical. Divergence of the particle\ntrajectories in the two simulations, resulting from advection by sea ice rather than the ocean,\n9\ncould be as great as 2000 km after 1 year of advection (mean for particles affected by sea ice \u0000\n387.75 km), and more than 6500 km after 3 years (mean \u0000 1003.74 km).\nParticles that are affected by sea ice motion in their first year of advection are generally those\nthat are released within the area of maximum sea ice extent. However, not all of the particles\nreleased within this area interact with the sea ice (Fig. 3), primarily because of the timing of\nparticle release. The particles were released in January, a month of minimal sea ice cover in the\nSouthern Ocean, and the ocean currents [cf. Fig. 2(a)] are sufficient to move the particles away\nfrom the advancing sea ice so that the particle trajectories are the same in both velocity datasets.\nIn contrast, in limited release areas north of the maximum sea ice extent, the oceanic advection\nis such as to bring particles into contact with the advancing sea ice (Fig. 3), discussed later.\nThe model results suggest that there are areas where the sea ice can cause larger differences to\nthe transport pathways than in other locations (Fig. 3). Since our interest lies in the relationship\nbetween these advection routes and the large-scale distribution of Antarctic krill, we now exam-\nine the trajectories in the two scenarios from particles that originate in areas of krill occurrence\nas defined by Atkinson et al. (2004) [Fig. 1(b)]. For each grid cell with krill numbers above\n0 m \u0000\n\u0002\n, 3 year trajectories in the two velocity datasets were calculated as before, released on 1\nJanuary (Fig. 4). Only the trajectories that are different in the two scenarios are plotted since\nthe mean oceanic circulation is shown in Fig. 2(a).\n3.2.1 SE Pacific\/SW Atlantic\/Weddell Sea: 90 \u0001 W\u20130 \u0001\nParticles advected in the ocean only velocity fields from this region follow three major transport\npathways. These are associated with the Antarctic Coastal Current, the ACC and the Weddell\nGyre [Fig. 4(a)]. Those particles released from the southwestern Antarctic Peninsula (south of\n\u0000 65 \u0001 S) and in the Bellingshausen Sea are advected southwards along the western Antarctic\nPeninsula and westward in the coastal current. Some of these particles remain in the release\nregion for the 3 years of advection while others reach the Ross Sea. Particles released from the\nnorthern Antarctic Peninsula are carried eastwards by the ACC into the Scotia Sea. Depending\non release location, particles from this region can reach the island of South Georgia within one\n10\nyear in the model or can take more than a year to be advected into faster moving flow, reaching\nSouth Georgia in 2 to 3 years. Those particles released in the Weddell Sea are generally caught\nin the cyclonic circulation of the gyre with some particles crossing into the Scotia Sea. The\nparticles released in the southern Weddell Sea between 30 \u0001 W\u20130 \u0001 take approximately 1 year to\nreach the Scotia Sea and 3 years to pass 30 \u0001 E. Particles released close to the Antarctic continent\nin the southern Weddell Sea are generally advected southwards in the model velocity fields and\nexit the model domain. Northward flow along the eastern Antarctic Peninsula is slow. Advection\nfrom the northeastern tip of the Antartic Peninsula takes over a year to transfer material around\nthe tip of the Antarctic Peninsula and it is more than 2 years before the material is entrained\ninto the eastward flow of the ACC.\nIncorporating sea ice motion into the advection scheme affects most of the particles released in\nthis region (Fig. 3). The southwestern Antarctic Peninsula and Bellingshausen Sea particles are\nmoved northward out of the coastal current by the sea ice, increasing retention in this region and\nlimiting westward transport towards the Ross Sea [Fig. 4(b)]. The sea ice provides a connection\nbetween the Bellingshausen Sea and the South Shetland Islands ( \u0000 63 \u0001 S, 58 \u0001 W) north of the\nAntarctic Peninsula that is not present in the ocean velocity fields. The particles released north\nof the sea ice extent in Drake Passage ( \u0000 64 \u0001 S) follow the same eastward trajectories towards the\nSouth Orkney Islands ( \u0000 60.5 \u0001 S, 45 \u0001 W) for the first 7 months of advection in the two velocity\ndatasets. By this time (austral winter), the sea ice is at its maximum extent in this region and\nmoves the particles more rapidly eastward and via a shorter route than the ocean currents do so\nthat when the sea ice retreats and leaves the particles in the ocean, they are further east than those\nthat were advected without sea ice motion. Particles in the Weddell Sea are moved northwards\nby the advancing sea ice and as a result there is greater transfer into the eastern Scotia Sea from\nthis region. Transport across the central Weddell Sea is much more rapid when sea ice motion\nis included and particles are no longer lost over the southern boundary of the model from the\nsouthern Weddell Sea.\n11\n3.2.2 Eastern Weddell Gyre\/Prydz Bay: 0 \u0001 -90 \u0001 E\nThere are two main transport routes for particles released in this region, associated with the\nWeddell Gyre and the ACC [Fig. 4(c)]. Advection from the southeastern Weddell Gyre trans-\nports particles to the Scotia Sea within 2 to 3 years. The northward limb of the gyre advects\nmaterial from 0 \u0001 to 60 \u0001 E in 3 years while the flow of the central Weddell Gyre in the modelled\nvelocity fields is slow. East of 60\u0001 E, particles released north of \u0000 65 \u0001 S are entrained into the\nACC following deflection of the flow field around the Kerguelen Plateau. Some of these par-\nticles reach 180 \u0001 W after 3 years of advection. Particles released south of \u0000 65 \u0001 S are advected\nwestward in the coastal current to join the cyclonic circulation of the Weddell Gyre.\nThe majority of particles released in this region are strongly affected by sea ice motion [Fig.\n3, Fig. 4(d)]. Those particles released further west and south are still advected westwards in\nthe coastal current\/Weddell Gyre but the northward sea ice motion encountered west of 30 \u0001 E\n[Fig. 2(b)] advects the particles out of the westward current and north across the Weddell Gyre.\nThis cuts off the connection to the Scotia Sea from this region. Particles released north of the\nmaximum sea ice extent around 60 \u0001 E (north of 60 \u0001 S) are affected by sea ice. The ocean velocity\nfields take the particles southeastward where the particles encounter the sea ice in austral winter.\nAs with the Drake Passage particles, the sea ice motion in this region provides a shorter transport\nroute than the ocean only motion and so the particles in the sea ice\/ocean velocity fields are\nadvected further in the same time period.\n3.2.3 Dumont d\u2019Urville Sea: 90 \u0001 E-180 \u0001\nWest of 150 \u0001 E in this region, oceanic transport is dominated by the westward flow of the Antarc-\ntic Coastal Current [Fig. 4(a)]. Most particles are advected westward to 80 \u0001 E where the flow\ndiverges; from here some particles continue westward, reaching the Cosmonaut Sea in 3 years\nin the model, and others are taken northwards to join the ACC by deflection in the flow caused\nby the Kerguelen Plateau. Recirculation in the Dumont d\u2019Urville Sea, centred at \u0000 120 \u0001 E, is\napparent in the particle trajectories (cf. Nicol et al., 2000). East of 150 \u0001 E, most particles are\nadvected eastward in the ACC with connection to the Amundsen Sea within the 3 years of\n12\ntransport. There is some retention offshore of the Antarctic continent at \u0000 165 \u0001 E.\nWhen sea ice motion is included [Fig. 4(b)], divergence of the advection pathways from this\nregion still occurs at \u0000 150 \u0001 E. West of 150 \u0001 E, the Antarctic Coastal Current carries particles\nwestward but all particles are deflected northwards by the Kerguelen Plateau so that there is no\nlonger any transport to the eastern Weddell Gyre. The gyre observed at 120 \u0001 E in the ocean only\nvelocity fields is still apparent in the combined sea ice\/ocean advection. West of \u0000 150\u0001 E, sea\nice advects all particles northwards into the ACC so that there is increased eastward transport,\nreaching as far east as the Bellingshausen Sea in 3 years.\n3.2.4 Ross Sea, Amundsen Sea: 180 \u0001 \u201390 \u0001 W\nThe dominant oceanic feature in this region is the Ross Gyre [Fig. 4(c)] which can retain parti-\ncles for the 3 years of simulation. Particles released on the eastern side of the cyclonic gyre are\nadvected southwards and then westwards once entrained into the coastal current. This provides\na transport pathway along the Antarctic continent as far as 105 \u0001 E. Particles released west of\nthe Ross Gyre are carried eastwards by the ACC. Some of the particles that originate in the\nBellingshausen Sea (east of \u0000 100 \u0001 W) are retained in their source region while others are taken\nwestward to the southern Ross Sea.\nThe inclusion of sea ice motion modifies these advection pathways substantially [Fig. 4(d)]\nand all particles are affected (Fig. 3). Apart from some retention in the western Amundsen\nSea, the sea ice advects all particles northwards out of the coastal current and across the gyre\ninto the ACC. There is no longer any retention associated with the Ross Gyre nor westward\ntransport in the Antarctic Coastal Current; instead, transport is eastward with the ACC. This\nopens up a connection between the Ross Sea and the Scotia Sea, and from the Amundsen and\nBellingshausen Seas to the western Antarctic Peninsula.\n13\n3.3 Scotia Sea variability\nSo far we have considered advection in climatological (annually-repeating) monthly mean\nocean velocity and sea ice motion fields. We now go on to examine the impacts of temporal\nvariability in the two datasets on transport pathways across the Scotia Sea. We quantify the re-\nsults by focussing on transport to South Georgia. Thorpe et al. (2004) previously investigated\ntemporal variability in oceanic transport to South Georgia using output from a different global\nocean circulation model, the Semtner\/Chervin Parallel Ocean Climate Model, and found that\nchanges in regional ocean circulation were important. Our investigation extends this research\nby considering the impacts of sea ice variability.\nIncorporating sea ice motion into the advection scheme provides different source regions for\nparticles that reach South Georgia than do models that include only oceanic transport (Fig. 5).\nParticles in the ocean velocity fields that reach South Georgia within a year (as defined by the\ndashed box around South Georgia marked on Fig. 5) generally originate from a restricted area\nin the north of the release region that includes the northern Antarctic Peninsula and the South\nScotia Ridge. Particles released further south along the peninsula and from the Weddell Sea\nhave little if any chance of being advected to South Georgia in the modelled ocean velocity\nfields at this depth [Fig. 5(a)]. For the particles advected in the sea ice\/ocean velocity fields,\nthe same northern source regions are evident but, in addition, particles have some chance of\nreaching South Georgia from the Weddell Sea and further east along the South Scotia Ridge\nwhen the sea ice motion is included [Fig. 5(b)].\nDuring the 6 year period of monthly particle releases, the probability of particles reaching South\nGeorgia from each monthly release as a whole is very similar in both the ocean only tracking\nand the sea ice\/ocean tracking [Fig. 6(a)] suggesting that the ocean signal dominates at these\ntimes. Periods when the two series differ show the contribution of sea ice variability. During\nthe early part of the series (January 1993\u2013October 1994) there is a slightly higher probability\nof particles in the sea ice\/ocean velocity fields reaching South Georgia. Later in the series, the\ndifference is more substantial with a 50% increase in the probability of reaching South Geor-\n14\ngia in the sea ice\/ocean velocity fields from releases made in austral autumn 1997. In terms\nof transport time to South Georgia from the release sites, we consider only those particles that\nreach South Georgia from each monthly release and calculate the average time taken by these\nmonthly subsets of particles [Fig. 6(b)]. The average time taken ranges from \u0000 130\u2013250 days in\nboth series. For much of the tracking period, the two series are very similar but there are differ-\nences when particles subjected to sea ice motion take longer to reach South Georgia than those\nadvected in the ocean only velocity fields (e.g. austral winter 1995 and austral autumn\/winter\n1997). Despite the seasonal pattern of sea ice advance and retreat which might be expected to\naffect the probability of particles reaching South Georgia, there does not appear to be a strong\nseasonal pattern in the results.\nWhen the number of particles that arrive at South Georgia in any given month (a function of\nthe probability of reaching South Georgia and the associated travel time of each particle) is\nconsidered, it is clear that variability is increased with the inclusion of sea ice motion in the\nadvection scheme [Fig. 6(c)]. While influx of particles advected to South Georgia in the ocean\nonly velocity fields is relatively steady with particles arriving each month, including sea ice\nmotion concentrates the particles into pulses of arrival. For example, there are months of almost\nzero influx when sea ice motion is included (October\u2013November 1995, October 1997, Novem-\nber 1997) together with months of much higher than usual influx (December 1993, October\n1994, March 1995, January 1996 and January\u2013March 1998). These periods of increased influx\nin the sea ice\/ocean particle time series tend to coincide with peaks of increased average \u2018age\u2019\nof the particles arriving at South Georgia each month [Fig. 6(d)]\u2014i.e. the average time taken to\nreach South Georgia by the ensemble of particles that reach the island each month. The largest\npositive effect on influx to South Georgia caused by the sea ice motion variability occurred in\naustral summer 1998, an anomalous year in terms of summer sea ice extent in the Weddell Sea\n(cf. Ackley et al., 2001) with the sea ice remaining north of the South Scotia Ridge ( \u0000 61 \u0001 S)\nfrom winter 1997 until summer 1997\/1998 [Fig. 6(e)]. The anomalous northward extent of the\nsea ice in November and December provided a means of transport for particles from further\nsouth than usual and advected the particles that were in association with the sea ice further\nnorth than normal. Sea ice retreat then deposited the particles into the southern part of the ACC\n15\nfrom where they were transported to South Georgia in the ocean currents. The particles reached\nSouth Georgia the following January\u2013March 1998 [Fig. 6(c)] having spent some time within\nthe ice and thereby increasing the average \u2018age\u2019 of the particles reaching South Georgia during\nthat period of time by more than two months [Fig. 6(d)].\nIn a recent modelling study, Fach and Klinck (2006) also examined krill transport to South\nGeorgia. They employed a regional ocean circulation model, the Harvard Ocean Prediction\nSystem (HOPS), and simulated transport at 50 m depth for a run of 10 month duration without\ninteraction with sea ice. Their results identified five potential source regions for krill at South\nGeorgia at that depth and within that timeframe: the western Antarctic Peninsula, Bransfield\nStrait, Scotia Sea\/Elephant Island, the southwestern Antarctic Peninsula and the Weddell Sea\n(their Fig. 11). Our study, using a greater depth (average of the upper \u0000 200 m of the water\ncolumn), suggests that the South Scotia Ridge is a key source region for South Georgia krill\nwhen advected in ocean currents only and that the inclusion of sea ice motion adds the north-\nwestern Weddell Sea as a source region and enhances the potential transport from the area of\nthe South Shetland Islands (Fig. 5). Results using a shallower depth-weighted mean calculated\nfrom the OCCAM velocity fields (the upper 64 m of the water column; not shown) indicate the\nsame source regions for krill at South Georgia as the results of Fach and Klinck (2006). This\ndifference in source regions is most likely due to the increased northward motion associated\nwith Ekman transport at the shallower depths which quickly moves particles northwards into\nthe faster-flowing offshore currents, as noted by Hofmann et al. (1998).\nIn terms of importance of the timing of particle release for most successful transport of krill\nto South Georgia, Fach and Klinck (2006) made three releases of particles in their model in\nDecember, January and February. An early release (i.e. December) increased the number of\nparticles reaching South Georgia in their simulation. Our results (Fig. 6), based on monthly\nreleases made over 6 years, do not show such a straightforward pattern but instead suggest that\ninterannual variability in the ocean circulation is important, particularly with respect to transport\ntime across the Scotia Sea.\n16\n4 Discussion\n4.1 Physical assumptions of the model\nThe circumpolar trajectories that we present are dependent on the ability of the ocean model,\nOCCAM, to simulate a realistic circulation in our study area. Circumpolar validation of OC-\nCAM in the Southern Ocean has not been carried out but studies in the Scotia Sea region show\nthat OCCAM reproduces the frontal structure of the southern ACC with realistic velocities (al-\nbeit slightly increased) and transports (Thorpe et al., 2002, 2005). There are discrepancies in\nthe position of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front in the Scotia Sea in OCCAM\n(Thorpe et al., 2005) but this does not affect transport times to South Georgia when compared\nwith historical drifter data for example. Mean transport times in the upper ocean of OCCAM\nfrom the Antarctic Peninsula to South Georgia of \u0000 160 days reported by Murphy et al. (2004a)\nagree with near-surface drifter trajectories in the same region (Thorpe, 2001). This suggests\nthat those particles advected in the ACC fronts in our study will have realistic transport times.\nBackground transport will likely be slower in the model than in the ocean due to the horizontal\nresolution of the model and the use of the monthly mean velocity fields in our advection scheme\nwhich reduces mesoscale effects. This should be borne in mind when the transport times in such\nregions are considered.\nUse of monthly mean velocity fields (both for the ocean circulation and the sea ice motion)\nreduces the amount of higher frequency and mesoscale variability in our results and will some-\nwhat smooth the particle trajectories. Whilst this is acceptable for the present study, use of\nhigher temporal resolution velocity fields where available would be a useful progression of the\ncircumpolar transport model and would in particular allow a more detailed representation of the\nseasonal sea ice growth and retreat cycle. The lack of a sea ice model in OCCAM led us to use\nsatellite data for the sea ice motion. This ensures realistic movement of the sea ice but use of a\ncoupled sea ice-ocean model will allow investigation of the fate of krill that are beneath the sea\nice but not directly attached to it. As such, our results show the maximum likely effects of the\ninteraction with sea ice but it is likely that observed pathways would be somewhere between the\n17\ntwo scenarios.\n4.2 Biological assumptions of the model\nOur model makes some basic biological assumptions about the behaviour and life cycle of\nAntarctic krill. The ontogenesis of krill involves vertical movement through the water column\nto a depth of 500\u2013800 m and generally takes \u0000 12\u201330 days (Hofmann and Hu\u00a8srevog\u02d8lu, 2003;\nTarling et al., 2006). We have not included this developmental cycle in our model. Krill are\nactive in their environment from an early stage, becoming more mobile and capable of faster\nswimming speeds with age (Kils, 1982). It is likely that they can respond to ambient food\nconcentrations, water temperature and predation. We assume the net effect of these smaller-\nscale movements is random and do not include them in our model. While directed horizontal\nmigration by krill has been inferred in coastal regions (Siegel, 1988), there is no evidence that\nkrill show directed migration in oceanic regions. If krill are capable of these longer, directed\nmovements, the areas where this will have most effect is in regions of slower moving currents.\nIn the faster ocean jets found in the Southern Ocean where speeds often exceed the maximum\nswimming speed of krill, the currents are likely to dominate over the krill movement (Murphy\net al., 2004a,b); however, movements into and out of the jets will be important in determining\nsubsequent transport pathways.\nDiel vertical migration (DVM) has been well-observed in euphausiids and has been reported\nfor Antarctic krill in the summer season (Miller and Hampton, 1989) and more recently over\nan annual cycle using fishing depth data as a proxy for krill depth (Taki et al., 2005). Murphy\net al. (2004a) investigated the effect of incorporating simple DVM into model simulations using\nthe same advection scheme as this study. They found that on the large-scale the DVM scheme\nhad little impact on the trajectories as compared with using a depth-weighted mean velocity\nfield over the same depth range. Thus, by using the depth-weighted mean velocity fields in our\nsimulations we have to some extent included the effects of this aspect of krill behaviour. More\ncomplex DVM patterns, where for example the krill spend a larger proportion of time in the\nsurface layer of the ocean than at depth, would affect the trajectories (c.f. Murphy et al., 2004a)\n18\nbut have not been included. The differences noted above between our results and those of Fach\nand Klinck (2006) suggest that the depth range used to simulate krill transport is important,\nparticularly at a regional scale. Hence, future models that further examine this matter should\nuse the appropriate depth for the appropriate stage of the krill life cycle.\nA further caveat of our model is that the depth range that we have chosen for the oceanic\nadvection is representative of the summer season. Recent data suggest that Antarctic krill have\na seasonally-varying DVM cycle with deeper vertical distribution and a greater amplitude of\nDVM in winter (Taki et al., 2005, and see also Siegel (2005)). Our model does not simulate\nthis particular aspect of behaviour but future runs will examine the impact of these seasonal\nchanges.\nIn relation to krill behaviour associated with sea ice, our model assumes that when sea ice is\npresent krill are moved directly with the sea ice rather than in the water column below the ice.\nWe have assumed no dispersal under the sea ice; movements by the krill under the ice could\nintroduce further variability and will be worth considering in future studies. There is a lot of\nevidence that smaller larval and juvenile krill are found in sea ice habitats on the under-surface\nof the ice or in brine channels within the ice, feeding on the ice algae (e.g. Quetin and Ross,\n2003). Sea ice algae provide an over-winter food source for krill that appears particularly crucial\nfor the larvae and juveniles that have little energy storage capacity (e.g. Ross and Quetin, 1989;\nMeyer et al., 2002). For these younger krill that are closely associated with the sea ice (Frazer\net al., 1997), it is likely that they are transported with the sea ice as it is moved. For adult krill,\nthe situation appears more complex. There are reports of adult krill under the sea ice (Marschall,\n1988) but there are also studies that have suggested that adult krill show little association with\nsea ice (Guzman, 1983) and that in some areas the krill are found in the water column below\nthe ice (Daly and Macauley, 1988), at depth below the mixed layer (Holzlo\u00a8hner, 1980) or even\nin association with the sea bed (Gutt and Siegel, 1994). In spring, adult krill are found in the\nmarginal ice zone (e.g. Brierley et al., 2002). This may be where the animals overwintered or\nthe result of physical\u2013biological interaction generating aggregations of krill. This complexity of\napparent responses of adult krill to sea ice habitats may partly be explained by the heterogeneity\n19\nof the sea ice environments (Quetin and Ross, 1991), which may generate very different over-\nwinter habitats. Our approach thus generates the maximum effect that association with sea ice\nmay have on the distribution of krill populations.\nFinally, we have presented results for the circumpolar trajectories from particles released on 1st\nJanuary. The krill spawning season occurs between November and April, depending on location\n(Spiridonov, 1995), and krill are capable of multiple spawnings in good conditions (Ross and\nQuetin, 1983; Cuzin-Roudy, 1987a,b, 2000; Quetin and Ross, 2001; Tarling et al., 2006). Vari-\nability in the timing of spawning will affect interactions with the changing sea ice distribution\nso that, although on the large scale the main transport routes remain the same, locally there\ncould be differences in the timescales of retention and transport pathways as observed from the\nScotia Sea results.\n4.3 Circumpolar transport\nThe traditional view of circumpolar connections in the Southern Ocean is dominated by the role\nof the eastward-flowing ACC (e.g. Hofmann and Murphy, 2004). While this research has shown\nthe ACC to be important, it has also highlighted the connections provided by the westward-\nflowing Antarctic Coastal Current which appears to connect many of the regions of higher krill\ndensity. For example, the Antarctic Coastal Current provides a connection between the regions\nof increased krill density in the Dumont d\u2019Urville Sea to those in Prydz Bay, to the Cosmonaut\nSea and ultimately, via the Lazarev and Weddell Seas, to the Scotia Sea. The Coastal Current\ncan transport material as quickly as the ACC in our simulations so that in some places such\nas the Scotia Sea material can arrive from opposite sides of the Antarctic continent (Ross Sea\nand Cosmonaut Sea) on the same timescales (Fig. 7). [Note that the pattern of krill abundance\nshown in Fig. 1(b) suggests that the western Antarctic Peninsula is likely to be the dominant\nsource region for krill at South Georgia.] This suggests that one of the reasons why the Scotia\nSea is a consistently high density krill region [Atkinson et al. (2004); Fig. 1(b)] is the existence\nof these convergent pathways, where flows from Drake Passsage and further west meet water\nfrom the Weddell Sea region and further east. This convergence of flows from potential source\n20\nregions may help to explain the asymmetrical krill distribution (Marr, 1962).\nRegions of transfer between the ACC and the Coastal Current can create areas of retention\naround the continent, for example along the western Antarctic Peninsula to the Bellingshausen\nand Amundsen Seas, and in the Dumont d\u2019Urville Sea. On longer timescales ( \u0000 10 years; data\nnot shown), advection within the Weddell Gyre forms a closed loop and provides a means of\npopulation retention in that region.\nConsidering interactions with sea ice increases the complexity of the potential connections be-\ntween krill populations. The model has shown that sea ice interactions will be important in\ndetermining the spatial links that occur in Southern Ocean ecosystems. Sea ice-related drift can\nmodify the pathways of transport, generating regional connections between areas that are iso-\nlated in the mean circulation view. For example, sea ice motion enables northward transfer along\nthe western Antarctic Peninsula connecting the Bellingshausen Sea to the tip of the Antarc-\ntic Peninsula (i.e. the opposite direction to the mean ocean circulation) and ultimately towards\nSouth Georgia, as well as more rapid transfer from the southern Weddell Sea into the Scotia Sea.\nIn other regions, the interaction with sea ice motion impedes some of the oceanic connections\u2014\nprimarily those associated with the Coastal Current, for example there is no longer any west-\nward transfer from the western Antarctic Peninsula to the Amundsen Sea, nor transfer from\nPrydz Bay to the Scotia Sea. The potential for enhancement or indeed reduction of regional\nretention of krill (e.g. the southwestern Antarctic Peninsula and the Ross Sea respectively) is\ngenerated by the inclusion of sea ice-related motion. Clearly, smaller-scale processes such as\nmesoscale features and temporal variability will be important in generating transfer between the\nmain pathways of transport illustrated in our results and future work will focus on this matter.\nKrill spawning can occur throughout much of the Southern Ocean, but the capacity for suc-\ncessful spawning, whereby the egg can sink to a required depth for hatching and the larva is\nable to return to the surface using its energy reserves, will depend on local and historical con-\nditions for feeding and temperature. A modelling study by Hofmann and Hu\u00a8srevog\u02d8lu (2003)\nshowed that there are specific locations on the continental shelf around Antarctica where the\nenvironmental conditions (water temperature and depth) are more suited to successful spawn-\n21\ning [in waters deeper than 1000 m, Hofmann and Hu\u00a8srevog\u02d8lu (2003) found no constraints on\nsuccessful spawning due to the presence of Circumpolar Deep Water]. Key regions for success-\nful spawning were found to be on the continental shelves of the western Antarctic Peninsula,\nthe Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas and the Dumont d\u2019Urville Sea. It is in these localities\nthat the advective transport will be especially crucial and where the accurate representation of\nthe sea ice\/ocean contributions to the advection will be important. Our modelling study has\nshown that these are regions where including the sea ice motion can have a large impact on the\nresultant advection.\nWe stress that the circumpolar model uses climatological, monthly mean velocity fields for these\nsimulations. The use of climatological velocity fields means that while the particle trajectories\nillustrate the mean interactions between the ocean circulation and the sea ice motion, interannual\nvariability is not considered. Changes from year to year in both ocean circulation patterns (e.g.\nfrontal positions, increased mesoscale variability) and sea ice motion and extent will affect\nthese general pathways (as shown in the Scotia Sea investigation). In addition, the monthly\nmean velocity fields smooth out some of the mesoscale variability of this region and mean that\nparticles are released from the sea ice more rapidly than they might be in reality. Furthermore,\nwe have not explicitly included diffusion. Mesoscale variability and diffusion will be important\nphysical processes, potentially increasing retention, transfer from one oceanic current system to\nanother and contact with sea ice depending on location. There are clearly regions where these\nsmaller-scale motions (and those of the krill themselves) could have a big impact on the krill\ndistribution. For example, between 0 \u0001 \u201330 \u0001 W some southward motion, due to sea ice retreat\nor eddying motion perhaps, could move the krill into the Weddell Gyre rather than continuing\neastward with the ACC. While we are interested in the mean pathways for this research, it would\nbe useful for future simulations to include such processes.\n4.4 Scotia Sea variability\nTo investigate interannual variability, we chose a smaller study region focussing on the Scotia\nSea, an area of particularly high krill density. Studies at South Georgia have shown interan-\n22\nnual variability in local krill abundance, related to variability in recruitment upstream and to\nvariability in transport to the island (Brierley et al., 1997; Murphy et al., 1998; Murphy and\nReid, 2001; Trathan et al., 2003; Thorpe et al., 2004). Sea ice motion in the Weddell Sea ex-\nhibits mesoscale variability that was evident in the monthly mean motion dataset employed in\nour model. Speed of the sea ice drift during our study period ranged from almost stationary to\napproximately 15 cm s \u0000\n\u0001\n, comparable to the swimming speed of adult krill.\nThe model results have shown that variability in sea ice motion increases variability in transport\nto South Georgia. For a lot of the time, the variability introduced by the oceanic variability\ndominates the signal but in years of extreme sea ice extent, then the sea ice introduces additional\nvariability into the Scotia Sea transport. These periods when the sea ice does make a difference\nwill be important for the South Georgia krill populations and therefore to the krill-dependent\npredators that breed on South Georgia.\nObservations of length-frequency distribution made at South Georgia have suggested different\nsource regions for the island\u2019s krill population with very small krill noted in association with\nWeddell Sea water, suggesting occasional transport from the Weddell Sea to South Georgia\n(Watkins et al., 1999; Siegel et al., 2004). Our model results suggest that interaction with sea\nice fosters additional source regions for krill at South Georgia, especially in years of anomalous\nice extent when more particles reach South Georgia from the northern Weddell Sea. Sea ice\nextent in the Scotia Sea and circumpolarly has been observed to have a periodicity of variability\n(Murphy et al., 1995; White and Peterson, 1996); our results suggest that, while a longer time\nseries is required to fully investigate the impacts, this has further implications for the South\nGeorgia ecosystem.\n5 Conclusions\nThe modelling studies presented here have important results for the consideration of spatial\nconnections between the circumpolar populations of Antarctic krill. The Antarctic Coastal Cur-\nrent can connect the near-continental regions of higher krill density while the ACC provides\n23\ntransport in the opposite direction at lower latitudes. Transfer between these current systems,\neither by mesoscale ocean features, movement with sea ice or small-scale krill movements for\nexample, will affect regional dispersal or retention which could enhance population stability.\nThe interaction with sea ice is a key part of the life cycle of Antarctic krill and the differences\nin transport generated by over-winter association with sea ice environments revealed in this\nstudy will have a major effect on krill population distribution. Interaction with sea ice can\nfurther increase regional population retention or dispersal. The association with sea ice provides\nmore options whereby the smaller-scale behavioural\/development changes of Antarctic krill can\naffect the regional and circumpolar distribution. For example, the interaction with sea ice in\nwinter during early life stages followed by ocean-dominated interaction and transport during\nthe adult stages may generate alternate directions of drift and be an aspect of the life cycle that\ngives rise to population retention. These interactions will be particularly important in the high\nkrill density regions of the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Sea.\nOn a regional scale, temporal and spatial variability in sea ice cover and motion increases\nvariability in oceanic transport to South Georgia, both in terms of influx to the island and in\ntimescales of transport. This is likely to impact on the krill populations at South Georgia and\nthe higher predators that depend on these populations. Variability associated with the sea ice\nwill also be important at other circumpolar locations, particularly in areas of spawning.\nFuture work will develop these hypotheses. The availability of higher resolution coupled ocean-\nsea ice models will allow investigation of more detailed scenarios of krill-sea ice associations,\nwhile including more biological aspects of krill will allow closure of the krill life cycle. Our\nwork has shown that it is crucial to better resolve these interactions.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Beverly de Cuevas at the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton for providing\nthe OCCAM output and the National Snow and Ice Data Center, Boulder for the sea ice motion\n24\ndata.
