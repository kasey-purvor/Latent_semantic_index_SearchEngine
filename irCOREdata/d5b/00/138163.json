Introduction \n \nPolymer\/clay nanocomposites preparation involves high temperatures irrespective of the \nfabrication route and also most polymeric materials require prolonged service in air at high \ntemperatures. If the processing temperature is higher than the thermal stability of the organic \ncomponent used for montmorillonite (MMT) modification, decomposition will take place, \nleading to variations in OMMT structure as the material degrades. Thus, determination of the \nonset temperature of degradation, resultant products of degradation and the stability of the \npolymer in the presence of layered silicates as well as understanding the relationship between \nthe molecular structure and the thermal stability (decomposition temperature, rate, and the \ndegradation products) of the organic modifier in the galleries of layered silicate is critical \n[1,2].  \nIt has been reported that some nanocomposites combining MMT and polymer matrix \nexhibited improved thermal stability [3,4], such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) [5], \npoly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) [3], polyimide (PI) [6,7] and polypropylene (PP) systems [8]. \nIn a previous paper [9], it was noted that the introduction of layered silicates into polymer \nmatrix may enhance its thermal stability. However, thermal behaviour of polymer\/MMT \nnanocomposites is complicated and many factors contribute to increase in thermal resistance. \nDue to characteristic structure of layers in polymer matrix and nanoscopic dimensions of filler \nparticles, several effects have been observed that can explain the changes in thermal \nproperties. The level of surface activity may be directly influenced by the mechanical \ninterfacial adhesion or thermal stability of organic compound used to modify montmorillonite. \nThus, increasing the thermal stability of organically modified MMT (OMMT) and resultant \nnanocomposites is one of the key points in the successful technical application of \npolymer\/clay nanocomposites on the industrial scale. Based on recent research, our previous \nreview provided a detailed examination of factors influencing thermal stability including the \nrole of chemical constitution of organic modifier, composition and structure of \nnanocomposites and mechanisms of improvement of thermal stability in \npolymer\/montmorillonite nanocomposites. The present work reviews thermal properties and \ndegradation processes of nanocomposites based on different polymer matrixes. It discusses \nthe basic changes in thermal behaviour of different polymeric matrixes (polyolefins, \npolyamides (PA), styrene-containing polymers, PMMA, poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), \npolyesters, PI, epoxy resins, polyurethanes (PU), ethylene\u2013propylene\u2013diene terpolymer \n 3\n(EPDM), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA),  and polylactide) upon addition of montmorillonite with \nspecial focus on the influence of montmorillonite on kinetics of degradation process and \nformulation of condensed\/volatile products in oxidative and pyrolytic conditions.  \nIn this work, if not otherwise stated, terms like \u201cclay content\u201d, \u201cfiller content\u201d, \u201csilicate \ncontent\u201d, \u201corganobentonite content\u201d, etc., indicate the content of organomodified \nmontmorillonite in nanocomposite. \n \n2. Polyolefins \n \nIn our previous paper the thermal stability of polymeric nanocomposites was shown to be \nstrongly dependent on the degree of MMT exfoliation\/intercalation [9]. In fact, several factors \nwere found to govern the thermal stability of nanocomposites material, such as intrinsic \nthermal resistance of polymer matrix, nanofiller content, chemical constitution of organic \nmodifier in bentonite and chemical character of polar compatibilizers as well as an access of \noxygen to composite material during heating. When considering polyolefins for \nnanocomposites matrix, difficulties can be foreseen in dispersing the nanoadditives due to \npolyolefins\u2019 weak intermolecular attractions (van der Waals forces) between hydrocarbon \nchains of polyolefin and the octadecylammonium species of organobentonite. Therefore, \nwhen attempting to disperse MMT additional compatibilization is required to strengthen the \ninterfacial interactions in hybrid material. As a result the use of polyethylene (PE) or PP \nmodified with polar copolymers as a matrix for nanocomposite or a compatibilizing agent has \nbeen proposed in many works to improve nano-additive dispersion and achieve stabilizing \neffect of organoclay in polyolefin. For instance, Zhang et al. [10] prepared PP \nnanocomposites compatibilized with PP solid-phase graft, where maleic anhydride, methyl \nmethacrylate and buty1 acrylate were used as the grafting co-monomers. The obtained PP \nnanocomposites exhibited improved thermal stability in a function of MMT content. At \nrelatively low content of OMMT, the initial thermal stability increased, reaching a maximum \nat 4 phr of OMMT in nanocomposite, and then decreased when the OMMT content was \nhigher than 4 phr.  In related works by the same researchers [11,12], the temperature at the \nonset of the thermal decomposition of PP-clay nanocomposites was increased by nearly \n130\u00b0C, as compared with that of pure PP. Moreover, the weight loss curve of the PP \nnanocomposites was almost vertical which reflected a very rapid decomposition process. One \nof the goals of the research development was to obtain carbocation substituted clay with \nthermal stability higher than commercial ammonium-substituted clay exhibit [13]. From the \n 4\nFig. 1 one can see the enhanced thermal stability of the substituted tropylium cation clay \u2013 \nonly 2% of the mass was lost at 400\u00b0C.  \n \nFig. 1 \n \nChiu and co-workers [14] investigated the thermal stability of PP nanocomposites with \ndifferent organoclays and compatibilizers (maleic anhydride grafted PP (PP-g-MA) or \nstyrene-co-maleic anhydride oligomer (SMA)). The investigations confirmed the thermal \nstability enhancement of PP after adding dimethyl dehydrogenated tallow quaternary \nammonium ion (DDTQA) modified clay, while for the methyl tallow bis-2-hydroxyethyl \nquaternary ammonium (MTHQA) containing composites thermal stability enhancement was \nnot evident. It was pointed that the diminished thermal stability of PP was observed while \nMTHQA and SMA were simultaneously present in the PP matrix. On the other hand, the \nenhancement in thermal stability of PP\/DDTQA nanocomposites became more evident as a \nPP-MA compatibilizer was further added with maximum enhancement occurring at 10 wt. % \nof compatibilizer amount.  However, when protonated silicate, created as a result of \ndecomposition of the surfactant (Eqs.1 and 2), interacts with co-monomers showing \nsensitivity to acid catalyzed degradation reactions, adverse effect is observed [15].  \n \n \n \n \nWhen quaternary cation is bonded to layered silicate (LS) surface a H+ can be evolved: \n \n \n \n \nDeacylation reaction has been postulated for reduction in initial temperature of degradation of \ncompatibilized PP resin under non-oxidative conditions, except of ethylene-methyl acrylate-\nacrylic acid terpolymer modified system [16].  When octadecylammonium chloride modified \nclay (C18MMT) was further modified with MA in presence of diphenylamine-2-carboxylic \nacid as an initiator and then melt-blended with PP to obtain grafted-intercalated composites \n(GIC), the temperature at the onset of thermal decomposition was lower than that of \npolypropylene-C18MMT nanocomposites since GIC contained a large amount of clay and \n(C12H25)2 (CH3)2N+Cl\u2013 C10H21\u2013CH=CH2  +  C12H25(CH3)2N  +  HCl \nheat \n(C12H25)2 (CH3)2N+LS\u2013 C10H21\u2013CH=CH2  +  C12H25(CH3)2N  +  H+ + LS\u2013 \nheat \n(Eq. 1)\n(Eq. 2)\n 5\nlow-molecular-weight PP-g-MA, but the final decomposition temperature was higher than \nthat of polypropylene-C18MMT nanocomposite [11].  \nIn Qin et al. work the kinetic analysis of degradation process of PP upon addition of \nMMT revealed some changes of kinetic parameters, such as reaction order and activation \nenergy [17]. The value of reaction order n of PP nanocomposites with organomodified MMT \nboth upon addition of compatibilizer (PP-g-MA) and without it was altered from 1 for pure \nPP to 0. The similar change of reaction order was observed for composites with protonic clay \n(clay intercalated at acidic sites (H+) and denoted as H-MMT) while for Na-MMT composites \nn took intermediate values. The alteration of the reaction order, from first-order to zero-order, \nwas associated with the acidic sites inherently present in H-MMT and created on heating on \norganically modified clay layers. The enhanced thermal stability of PP\/MMT nanocomposites \nwas connected with increased activation energy. E increased as the clay particles in the PP \nmatrix became smaller and more homogeneous - the highest thermal stability had the PP\/PP-\ng-MA\/OMMT nanocomposite. This suggested that the shielding effect of the clay layers \ncould increase the activation energy of the thermal degradation of the polymer matrix.  \nLomakin et al. studied the thermo-oxidative degradation of PP nanocomposites and,  \naccording to the kinetic analysis, PP nanocomposites had superior thermal and fireproof \nbehaviour compared with neat PP [18]. The thermal stabilization effect of nanoclay structure \nin a polymer matrix was arising from a one-dimensional diffusion process of catalytic-\ncharring throughout the second step in the thermo-oxidative degradation of PP \nnanocomposites. This reaction type was ascribed as responsible for the overall process of \ncarbonization.  \nWhen sufficient energy is provided for the homolytic dissociation of bonds such as C\u2013\nC, C\u2013H or C\u2013O, the decomposition of PP-g-MA via free radical chain reactions occurs, which \nmay generate several products in the gas phase (e.g. acetic acid, formic acid, acetone, \nacetaldehyde and carbon mono- and dioxide) [19,20]. These products, due to their low \nmolecular weights, can migrate out of the solid polymer. By using the combined TG\/FTIR \ntechnique, qualitative and quantitative data concerning degradation of PP\u2013g\u2013MA with methyl \ntallow dihydroxyethyl ammonium modified MMT (PP-g-MA-MMT2EtOH) could be \nobtained giving some clues as to the chemistry of the reactions [21]. A detailed examination \nof the infrared spectra evolution of PP-g-MA revealed that beginning of the weight loss is \ncaused by the evolution of hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide\/monoxide. In nanocomposites, \nthe loss of these volatile products began at different temperatures depending on the \ncomposition and continued until the weight loss was completed. The spectra of gases evolved \n 6\nduring degradation from nanocomposites displayed the same bands as the spectrum of pure \npolymer, however, the intensity of absorbance for the hydrocarbons (2963 cm\u20131) band was \nlower. Furthermore, a disappearance of the CO2 bands and the bands in carbonyl region \n(around 1726 cm\u20131) displaying an acid evolution was noticed on the FTIR spectrum of the \ncorresponding PP-g-MA nanocomposite with N,N,N-trimethyloctadecylammonium (PP-g-\nMA-OD3MA) heated under N2 (in anaerobic conditions). In this case, absorbance of the 2963 \ncm\u20131 band and its shoulders increased slightly. Also, for the nanocomposites blended in air \nand heated in a flow of air the evolved gas profile calculated via the Gram-Schmidt algorithm \nindicated a delay in the release of volatile products over the decomposition of PP-g-MA \nnanocomposites with OD3MA modified clay. These data indicated some changes in the \namounts and sequences of evolution of volatile products caused by the presence of MMT, \nhowever further investigation is needed to propose a possible mechanistic model of \ndegradation reaction of PP-g-MA in a presence of OMMT.  \nThe evolved products of polyethylene (PE) and PE\/clay nanocomposite during thermal \ndegradation consist of hydrocarbons up to C31 (m\/z 436) [22]. At each carbon number three \ncomponents were detected by GC\/MS method: \u03b1,\u03c9-diene, 1-ene and alkane. Basically, these \ncompounds are produced through random scission followed by disproportionation reaction. \nAssuming that disproportionation is the only process for the termination of the degradation \nreaction, the ratio of (\u03b1,\u03c9-diene):(1-alkene):(alkane) should be 1:2:1. Referring to the GC \ntrace of virgin polyethylene, the intensity of \u03b1,\u03c9-diene is small compared to alkane, which \nimplies that, when polyethylene undergoes thermal degradation, some hydrogen abstraction \nreactions must occur in the condensed phase. In the presence of clay, some changes were \nobserved [23]. The peaks due to the \u03b1,\u03c9-diene structures decreased, those of alkane structures \nincreased and other noise-like peaks corresponding to other unsaturated structures were \nqualitatively increased. It was proposed that the extent of the hydrogen abstraction reaction is \nincreased qualitatively, producing more intense alkane peaks, and, more random scission \noccurs, which produces various unsaturated aliphatic structures having different positions for \nthe double bond in the chain. Since the clay layers act as a barrier, the degrading molecules \nare confined, which leads to more extensive random scission and hydrogen abstraction. \nIt is acknowledgeable that different thermal behaviour of polyolefin nanocomposites was \nobserved in inert and oxidative conditions. As a subject of the matter, studies by Adams et al. \n[24] have shown that oxidation reactions create thermally weak bonds, i.e. hydroperoxides \nand peroxides, that can initiate the thermal degradation. Indeed, the produced hydroperoxides \n 7\ncan decompose to propagate the oxidation process, leading to end products according to well-\nknown oxidation mechanism. In polyethylene (PE) nanocomposites the TG data analysis \nrevealed the delay of catastrophic weight loss under air and little stabilizing effect observed \nduring non-oxidative degradation. The postulated effect of protective role that generated \nsilica-rich char took part in reducing the rate of oxidative degradation in the composite \nmaterials and appeared most strikingly in the low density PE (LDPE) and \npoly(ethylmethacrylate) (PEMA) polymer systems, due to their low inherent resistance to \nambient oxygen [15]. Oxidation reactions could contribute to reduction of the thermal \nstability for maleic anhydride grafted PP nanocomposites (PP\u2013g\u2013MAH-MT2EtOH) produced \nin air as seen by the decrease of temperature at 50% mass loss (T50%) relative to the ones of \nPP\u2013g\u2013MA. On the other hand, in the case of PP\u2013g\u2013MA\u2013OD3MA blends, oxygen did not \nseem to play a determinant role. This was related to the absence of a reactive group in \ntrimethyl octadecyl ammonium (OD3MA) modified clay that could have initiated the \noxidation process \u2013 a hypothesis that was confirmed by using several organically-modified \nMMTs for systematic experiments. The first observation was that during the thermal \noxidation, decomposition was enhanced by the presence of oxygen comparatively to the ones \nobtained over the pyrolysis. Contrary to previous development, investigations conducted by \nZhang and Wilkie [25] noted little effect of the clay on the onset of non-oxidative thermal \ndegradation in PE nanocomposites, both with and without the incorporation of maleic \nanhydride \u2013 Tab. 1 \n \nTab. 1 \n \nIn other interesting development, poly (\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) and PS modified clay were \nused as filler for polyolefins [26]. The enhancements in the onset temperature were larger for \nPCL-modified clay than for the PS-modified clay. The TG curves for both PP and PE \nnanocomposites showed two steps in the degradation, while the virgin polymers showed only \na single step. The onset temperature was greatly enhanced for these systems and appeared that \nthe PCL present in the clay underwent the initial degradation and this stabilized the PP and PE \nsuch that they degraded at higher temperature. Regrettably, the work failed to give any \nexplanation for these observations. Further, Zhao and co-workers have investigated silane \nmodification of MMT [27,28]. Elsewhere, a recent work have revealed improved thermal \nstability of melt-processed nanocomposites of PE and MMT modified with  (N-\u03b3-\ntrimethoxylsilanepropyl)octadecyldimethylammonium chloride ( abbreviated as JSAc) [29]. It \n 8\nwas confirmed that reactive methoxylsilane groups from JSAc could react with hydroxyl \ngroups at the edges of clay layers. The main advantage of this method in comparison to \nprevious developments aiming at chlorosilane modification of montmorillonite was that the \nchemical reaction with hydroxyl groups at the edge of clay layers and the interlayer ion-\nexchange were carried out in one step therefore eliminating troublesome solvent disposal. For \nthe nanocomposites of PE and MMT modified with JSAc the highest thermal stability was \nobtained when the content of modified filler was about 2 wt. %; for higher MMT content the \nTmax was lower than that of pure PE.  \nFor ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, EVA, the thermal decomposition starts with the \nelimination of acetic acid (chain stripping) in the temperature region of 300\u2013350\u00b0C, leaving a \ndouble bond in the chain backbone, hence EVA is converted into poly(ethylene-co-acetylene), \nwhich undergoes further degradation to smaller molecules at higher temperature [30]. The GC \ntraces of virgin EVA are the same in terms of the major components and relative intensities \nwith that of PE. There is some common degradation pathway occurring if an allylic radical is \nformed by random scission and, after this radical either disproportionates or abstracts \nhydrogen, random scission occurs at the other allylic position.  \nIn the presence of clay, some definite differences were observed for EVA compared to \nthose in the PE\/clay system: the saturated alkane peaks (m\/z 240, 254, 268 and 282) increase, \nwhile the \u03b1,\u03c9-diene peaks (m\/z 236, 250, 264 and 278) decrease or disappear, and noise-like \npeaks, assigned to other unsaturated structures, increase [23]. The increased production of the \nsaturated compounds and the decreased evolution of \u03b1,\u03c9-diene indicate that hydrogen \nabstraction becomes more important. The greater number of the other unsaturated structure \nimplies that extensive random scission also is more extensive due to the presence of MMT. \nCostache et al. proposed that the differences in the degradation of the nanocomposites and \nvirgin EVA may arise from secondary reactions which the secondary allylic radicals can \nundergo [31]. In the case of EVA nanocomposites, the clay platelets can confine these \nradicals, so that recombination reactions become much more probable than in the case of \nvirgin copolymer. For EVA, the most probable reactions are radical transfer reactions with the \noriginal polymer, from which the newly formed radicals can return to the degradation cycle, \nundergoing additional scissions, etc. Also other reactions that might take place in the case of \nthe nanocomposite were pointed by authors as shown in Fig. 2. \n \nFig. 2 \n \n 9\nCross-linked structures can undergo further scissions, leading to the formation of radical \nspecies which can either disproportionate, producing various branched trienes, or recombine, \nforming other cross-linked structures and\/or internal olefins. Linear polymer chains which \nhave a favourable orientation promoted by clay confinement can undergo transient cross-\nlinking. In addition, the trienes formed can undergo Diels\u2013Alder cycloaddition reactions \nleading to cyclic structures and possibly, upon hydrogen abstraction, to other unsaturated \nstructures. All these cross-linked, branched or multiple double bonds containing structures \ncan explain the increased thermal stability of the nanocomposite observed by TGA, since \nmore energy is required to break the additional bonds formed. \n \n3. Polyamides \n \nPramoda et al. [32] investigated the volatile products from PA 6 nanocomposites \ndegradation.  The FTIR spectrum of the evolved gases from PA 6 nanocomposites in N2 \natmosphere showed the production of water, CO2 and an olefinic compound. Absorption \nbands were also observed at 1653, 1772, 3331 cm-1 and assigned to amide, carboxylic acid, \nand hydroxyl functional groups, respectively. However, the absorption at 1653 cm-1 did not \ncorrespond to the amide functional group of poly(\u03b5-caprolactam) oligomers but rather to \u03b5-\ncaprolactam monomer in agreement with the published data [33,34]. The IR spectra showed \nthe evolution of NH3 (970 cm-1) at the same temperature range as that of the organic \nfragments released, indicating the presence of the decomposition reactions in the organically \nmodified layered silicate systems during heating. The evolution of gas products from PA 6 \nnanocomposites in air started at around 340\u00baC and increased gradually to a maximum at \n485\u00baC, before decreasing. The majority of the gas evolution ended at 520 \u00baC and thereafter \nonly CO2 appeared along with the traces of other gas products. However, the major \ndegradation product was CO2 in all cases. The CO2 evolution was related to the cleavage of \nC\u2013N amide bond and the alkyl chain oxidation. Apart from CO2 other peaks suggested the \npresence of NH, OH and the cleavage of alkyl chain and existence of CH3, CH2 and NH3 \nfragments. The presence of CO was indicated at 2280 cm-1 by its characteristic double bands. \nThese peaks appeared almost simultaneously together with CO2 indicating the cleavage and \noxidation of alkyl chains. However, for the PA 6 with 2.5 wt. % clay there was another \nmaximum of CO2 volume at 625\u00baC, implying the intense oxidation of organic products in air. \nFurther, TG curve indicated that a weak but clear second decomposition peak was present \nunder air. \n 10\nTG investigations on the thermal degradation of PA 6\/clay showed that while single stage \ndecomposition was found in the N2 atmosphere, double-stage decomposition (as evidenced by \na shoulder\/peak at 630\u00baC) was found in the air atmosphere for nanocomposites containing 2.5 \nwt. % of organomodified MMT [32]. The degradation trends in N2 environment for both PA 6 \nand PA 6\/clay (2.5 wt. %) nanocomposites were similar but the residues left behind after \ndecomposition were different. While there was practically no residue left for PA 6, in the case \nof PA 6\/clay (2.5 wt. %) nanocomposites it was found to be 1.9% under nitrogen. The onset \ntemperature of degradation was about 10\u00baC higher for nanocomposite with 2.5 wt. % clay \nadditions than that for neat PA 6. This indicated that PA 6\/clay (2.5 wt. %) nanocomposites \nhad greater thermal stability than the pure PA 6, which was contrary to previous results \nobtained by Gilman [35]. These findings were related to morphological observations that \nshowed exfoliated structure only for 2.5 wt. % clay, and distinct clay agglomerations in \nnanocomposites with higher clay loadings [36]. Most importantly, the study suggested that \nonly exfoliated polymer nanocomposites exhibited improved thermal stability and that \nagglomerated clay particles did not significantly affect the thermal stability of the polymer \nmatrix.  \nVapour phase FTIR data can be supported by GC analysis, as it was done in recent work \nof Jang and co-workers on polyamide-based nanomaterials. The main degradation product of \nPA 6 detected by GC\/MS method was \u03b5-caprolactam (m\/z 113) [37,38]. Monomer is \nproduced mainly through end chain acidolysis and aminolysis. The other evolved products \ncorrespond to linear structures, which are produced by chain scission and hydrolysis of amide \nlinkage. In the presence of clay there were no significant differences found in the evolved \nproducts by FTIR method in terms of the peak positions [39]. However, the GC traces of the \nevolved products during thermal degradation of PA 6 nanocomposites showed more intense \npeaks for the linear compounds with less intense evolution of \u03b5-caprolactam \u2013 Fig. 3. \n \nFig. 3 \n \nFurthermore, the viscosity of residual condensed phase dissolved in formic acid increased \nwith an increasing clay content which indicates that more extensive random scission and \ninter-chain aminolysis or acidolysis have occurred. It was argued that inter-chain reactions \nbecome significant in the presence of clay because the degrading polymer chains are trapped \nin the gallery space of the clay during thermal degradation (Fig. 4).  \n \n 11\nFig. 4 \n \nGenerally, the thermal stability of PA\/MMT nanocomposites in terms of initial temperature of \ndecomposition (Tid) was slightly increased [32] or remained the same [40,41]. \nThermal degradation studies on PA 11\/organoclay nanocomposites clearly showed that \nthe onset  of decomposition temperature (at sample mass loss of 5 wt. %) was significantly \nimproved by about 20\u00baC at low nanofiller concentrations (< 4 wt. %) and quickly levelled off, \nespecially in air flow [42]. In contrast, at high clay content (8 wt. %), the (intercalated) \nnanocomposite degraded at temperature 5\u201310\u00baC inferior to the degradation of the pure \nunfilled PA 11 matrix. \nQin et al. [6] presented on thermal stability and flammability of PA 66\/MMT \nnanocomposites.  The TG profiles of pure PA 66, OMMT nanocomposite and MMT \nmicrocomposite in nitrogen and air environments showed that the nanocomposite had a higher \ndecomposition temperature (435\u00baC in nitrogen and 450\u00baC in air) than the microcomposite \n(425\u00baC in nitrogen and 440\u00baC in air). Interestingly, when compared to the pristine polymer, \nthe decomposition temperature of the nanocomposite was 10\u00baC lower than the pure PA 66 in \nnitrogen atmosphere but more than 5\u00baC higher than the pure PA 66 in air atmosphere. The \ndifference was related to the absence or presence of oxygen. The thermal behaviour of the \nnanocomposites in N2 atmosphere indicated that the addition of MMT accelerated the thermal \ndecomposition of PA 66 matrix, a fact the researchers associated to the catalysis of water \nevolved from MMT (adsorbed or from dehydroxylation). In oxidative atmosphere, the \ndegradation was mainly oxygenolysis and the barrier effect of the silicate layers was \ndominant due to the formation of carbonaceous silicate char on the surface of nanocomposite. \nTherefore, the nanocomposites had a higher thermal stability than pure PA 66 in air. \n \n4. Styrene-containing (co)polymers \n \nBourbigot et al. [43] showed that the routes of thermal degradation of PS\/MMT \nnanocomposites differ in pyrolytic and oxidative conditions. Both in inert atmosphere and in \noxidative conditions at around 200\u00baC small weight loss was observed (for nanocomposite \ncontaining 1.5 wt. % of OMMT) that was assigned to degradation of the organo-modifier of \nthe clay. Under pyrolytic conditions the thermal stability of nanocomposites was enhanced in \nterms of the onset temperature of degradation, which was 50\u00baC higher compared to pure PS. \nUnder thermo-oxidative conditions the degradation of pure polymer and its nanocomposite \n 12\noccurred at the comparable temperatures but the charring significantly increased for the \nPS\/MMT nanocomposites - from 5 to 15% at 400\u00baC. At higher temperatures it underwent \nfurther degradation resulting in 2% final residue in both oxidative and pyrolytic conditions - \nthis was assigned to the mineral content of MMT in nanocomposites (Fig. 5).  \n \nFig. 5 \n \nIt was confirmed that the degradation of polymeric materials in inert gas occurred in higher \ntemperature ranges than the process led in air atmosphere. For virgin PS the onset temperature \nof the main degradation in nitrogen was 30 \u00baC higher while for PS nanocomposites it was \n100\u00baC higher than the temperatures of thermo-oxidative degradation. In the case of thermo-\noxidative degradation the role of MMT was explained in terms of promoting the char \nformation.  \nFor the thermal degradation of PS and PS\/MMT nanocomposites under inert \natmosphere, the shape of TG curves and their derivatives suggested a degradation in one-step \nreaction, but the evolution of the shape as a function of the heating rate was an indication of \ncomplex reactions. The kinetic analysis of the thermal degradation of PS and PS\/MMT \nnanocomposites has been used to prove the complex character of that process in pyrolytic \nconditions. The researchers used Friedman analysis as a preliminary step of the kinetic \nanalysis. This approach provided the plot of the activation energy versus the fractional weight \nloss. The kinetic analysis revealed that both for the pure PS and its nanocomposites the \nactivation energy was not constant but grew from 80 to about 200 kJ\/mol (Fig. 6) indicating \nthat the degradation did not take place as a one-step reaction but as multi-step reactions.  \n \nFig. 6 \n \nThe highest quality of fit for pristine PS gave two competitive reactions with Avrami-Erofeev \nfunctions:  \nA B\nC\n1\n2\n \n \nThe pyrolysis of PS produces mainly styrene monomer and some oligomers of styrene \n(dimer, trimer, tetramer and pentamer) [44-46]. The proposed mechanism is thermal scission \n 13\nof the polymer chain, which yields primary radical species. Oligomers are produced via \nintramolecular radical transfer reactions. The reaction 1 in chosen model could be assigned to \nthe random scission of the polymeric chains since the activation energy calculated by \u2018model-\nfitting\u2019 method using Avrami-Erofeev model were approximately equal to the expected value \nof activation energy of PS chain scission. The other reactions involved in the pyrolysis of PS \nwere end-chain and mid-chain \u03b2-scission, radical recombination and hydrogen transfer. All \nthese reactions have relatively low activation energies (between 40 and 120 kJ\/mol) and were \nassigned to reaction 2 of the model proposed. Since the true reactions of the system are too \ncomplex to be characterized in any fundamental way, the reactions in models of thermal \ndegradation were described as pseudo (or lumped) species which are themselves complex \nmaterials or a mixture.  \nAs a result of Friedman analysis the researchers found activation energy of \nnanocomposites climbing from 80 to 200 kJ\/mol and then remaining constant. The final part \nof the curve was chaotic; the activation energy varied from 160 to 240 kJ\/mol. This indicated \nthat the degradation of nanocomposites occurs via complex reactions and supports the idea of \ncompetitive reaction. In the case of pyrolytic degradation of nanocomposites the model based \non two successive reactions of two competitive reactions with Avrami-Erofeev functions \nshowed goodness of fit. \n \nA B\nD\n1 2\n3 4\nC\nE\n \n \nDuring the first degradation step, nanocomposites exhibited kinetic parameters close to those \nof pure PS. Nevertheless, the significant difference between the two frequency factors of \nreaction 3 was found, suggesting that the probability of end-chain and mid-chain \u03b2-scission, \nradical recombination and hydrogen transfer reactions might be decreased in nanocomposites. \nThis phenomenon was used to explain the enhancement of the thermal stability of \nnanocomposites. \nSecond, the thermo-oxidative degradation of PS\/MMT have been investigated [43]. \nAgain, on the basis of the evolution of activation energy according to the Friedman analysis \nthe thermo-oxidative degradation of pristine polymer and its nanocomposites was found to be \na complex process with competitive reactions involved. Furthermore, a fact that the \nintermediate char yield strongly depends on the heating rate was an evidence of competitive \n 14\nreactions. According to the conclusions of the Friedman analysis, the degradation of the \nPS\/MMT nanocomposites in thermo-oxidative conditions was modelled using two \nsuccessive\/competitive reactions with n-th order functions. The determined activation \nenergies of nanocomposite were lower than those of PS, except for reaction 3.It was \ninterpreted in terms of (i) occurrence of oxygen initiated depolymerization of PS - the \npresence of the clay in PS lowered the energy of this reaction (reaction 1); (ii) as a result of \nthe MMT presence the activation energy of reaction 3 grew (a competitive reaction with \nreaction 1) and higher char weights were gained, suggesting that the clay plays the role of \nchar promoter; (iii) reactions 2 and 4 corresponded to char oxidation. The activation energies \nof reactions 2 and 4 of nanocomposites compared to pure PS were similar suggesting the \nsame type of reaction.  The degradation of the two systems starts at the same time but the \ndegradation rate of PS is faster than that of the nanocomposite. \nVyazovkin et al. [47-49] employed an advanced isoconversional method in order to \nobtain reliable kinetic information on the thermal and thermo-oxidative degradation of a PS-\nclay nanocomposite, prepared by intercalating a monocationic free radical initiator into the \nMMT clay and the subsequent solution surface-initiated polymerization (SIP), where the PS \nchain growth was initiated in situ from the clay surface. It has been found that the \nintroduction of the clay phase into PS causes a considerable increase in the effective \nactivation energy of degradation. This result can be explained by the barrier model, but also \nby a changed concentration distribution of degradation products and\/or formation of some \nnew volatile products. Such suggestion appears to correlate with the results of cone \ncalorimetry experiments [50] which indicate that the clay-enhanced PS composites tend to \nburn with the release of a significantly smaller amount of total heat. This may be because the \nconcentration distribution of the polymer degradation products for the clay-containing PS \nchanges toward the formation of less combustible products. In a subsequent study, Py-GC-MS \nand TG-FTIR techniques were applied to investigate the thermal degradation mechanism of \nPS nanocomposite; two main differences in mass and IR spectra of PS-based nanocomposite \nin comparison with those of pristine PS were observed, confirming formation of significant \namounts of \u03b1-methylstyrene and dimer and trimer derivatives in PS-clay system [47]. \u03b1-\nmethylstyrene is formed by intermolecular transfer reactions - the key step in this mechanism \nis hydrogen transfer from one chain to another, which yields a mid-chain radical whose \nscission produces an unsaturated chain end, \u03b2-scission of the latter yields an \u03b1-methylstyrene \nby hydrogen abstraction. Because of the large correlation distance in the regular PS melt, the \nprobability of the aforementioned intermolecular hydrogen transfer is low and so is the yield \n 15\nof \u03b1-methylstyrene. Conversely, the yield is increased in the \u2018brush melt\u2019 where the \ncorrelation distance is reduced to the interchain distance between the aligned grafted chains. \nGenerally, the conceptual model that links the enhancement of intermolecular interactions to \nthe formation of brush structure allows one to combine the mechanistic aspects of degradation \nwith the nanoscale structure and chain mobility of grafted polymer-clay systems. \nSyndiotactic PS (s-PS) has received considerable attention because it is regarded as a \nnew low-cost engineering polymer with various desirable properties. Although the \nnanocomposite formation of s-PS with organoclays promises to further extend the material \nproperties of the polymer, the fabrication of such nanocomposites by direct melt-intercalation \nof s-PS into commercial organically treated clays was problematic, mostly because of the \nthermal degradation of the available organic surfactants (typically alkyl-ammoniums and to a \nlesser extent phosphoniums), which decompose far below the high temperatures employed for \nthe melt processing of s-PS. Studies by Zhu on s-PS nanocomposites where montmorillonite \nmodified with ammonium cations was used indicated that the temperature at which 10% \ndegradation occurs was increased by 40\u201350\u00b0C, independent of the fraction of clay over the \nrange of 0.1\u20135%. The value for 50% degradation was typically 20\u201340\u00b0C higher and indicated \nsome dependence on the fraction of clay with larger enhancements at higher amounts of clay \n[51-53]. Insufficient thermal stability of organoclays and subsequent degradation of organic \ncations in montmorillonite galleries during processing usually caused difficulties in filler \ndispersing and generated contaminations influencing the final composition properties. On the \nother hand, when monoalkyl- and dialkyl-imidazolium surfactants were used to prepare \norganically modified montmorillonites with markedly improved thermal stability in \ncomparison with their alkyl-ammonium equivalents (the decomposition temperatures \nincreased by ca. 100\u00b0C), a formation of s-PS\/imidazolium-montmorillonite nanocomposites \nwas possible even under static melt-intercalation conditions in the absence of high shear rates \nor solvents [54].  \nIn Su and Wilkie development [55] new organomodifier containing vinylbenzyl \ngroups was obtained and applied in synthesis of polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) \nnanocomposites. Since the surfactant used for MMT modification contained vinyl group, the \nchemical coupling of polymer with surfactant molecules was expected during in situ \npolymerization of monomer.  As a result, the onset temperature of the degradation increased \nby about 50\u00b0C for PS\u2013clay nanocomposites and between 50 and 100\u00b0C for PMMA\u2013clay \nnanocomposites. Interesting results were obtained from the TGA performed on the insoluble \nmaterial extracted from these nanocomposites. This consisted of the clay along with the \n 16\npolymer polymerized onto the clay. The mass fraction of material that was non-volatile at \n600\u00b0C was 32% for the nanocomposite containing 0.5 wt.% of organomodified \nmontmorillonite, 29% for the  nanocomposite containing 3 wt.% of OMMT, and 21% for the \nnanocomposite containing 5 wt. % of clay, while the clay itself gave an 80% residue at \n600\u00b0C. These data allowed for calculation that in the nanocomposite containing 0.5 wt. % of \nclay the same fraction of polymer was grafted onto clay, 3.6 wt. % of polymer was bound in \nthe nanocomposite containing 3 wt. % of clay, and 10.4 wt. % of polymer was incorporated \ninto the 5% nanocomposite.  \nRecently, Wang and Wilkie [56] have investigated triphenylhexadecylstibonium \ntrifluoromethylsulfonate that had been prepared and ion-exchanged with Na+-MMT to obtain \nnew organically modified clay. The clay had higher thermal stability than ammonium clay - \nonly a portion of the alkyl chain was lost during degradation and all of the antimony was \nretained. This clay was then used to prepare a PS nanocomposite in which the clay was found \nnot uniformly distributed throughout the polymer. However, the thermal stability of the PS \nnanocomposite was enhanced in that the onset temperature of the degradation, as measured by \nthe temperature at which 10% mass was lost, was increased by 50\u00baC. Also, the mid-point of \nthe degradation was found 50\u00baC higher for the nanocomposite than for virgin PS. All in all, \nthe thermal stability of the PS nanocomposite investigated was quite comparable to what was \nobserved for ammonium clay nanocomposites.  \nIn the case of virgin PS, the degradation pathway is chain scission followed by \u03b2-scission \n(depolymerization), producing styrene monomer, dimer and trimer through an intra-chain \nreaction [57-59] [60,61]. The clay affects the degradation behaviour of polystyrene and a \nnumber of additional structures is formed [62]. The comparison of collected FTIR spectra of \ngases evolved during degradation of pure PS and its nanocomposites allowed to notice that \nsome products having phenyl alkene unit have been lost, while some saturated structures \nappeared. For the polystyrene nanocomposites a gradual increases in the intensity of the sp3 \ncarbon\u2013hydrogen stretching vibration occurred as the clay content increases, especially at \n2970 cm-1, which was assigned as the sp3 \u03b2 carbon\u2013hydrogen (methyl) stretching. The \ncarbon\u2013carbon double bond stretching at 1630 cm-1 and the C\u2013H out-of-plane deformations at \n990 and 910 cm-1 decreased with the clay content. For the pure PS, the FTIR spectra of \nvapour phase recorded as a function of mass loss showed no difference in the peak positions \nand their relative intensities, which means that the thermally degraded products were \nqualitatively the same from the beginning to the end stage of polymer degradation.  \n 17\nMore specific information about the chemical composition of the evolved products was given \nby GC\/MS method. In the presence of clay, except the styrene monomer (m\/z 104), dimer \n(m\/z 208), and trimer (m\/z 312) typically produced during PS degradation, several additional \nstructures were identified. The additional products, e.g. some head-to-head structures, were \nthought to be produced via radical recombination reaction followed by extensive random \nchain scission. Fig. 7 shows a proposed pathway for the radical recombination reactions.  \n \nFig. 7 \n \nIt was thought that through random chain scission and radical transfer, four radicals, denoted \nas A, B, C and D, might be produced. Considering the abundance and stability of radicals, A, \nC and D were thought to be the most abundant radicals in the degradation of polystyrene \nnanocomposites. In the case of the PS nanocomposite, due to the barrier effect of the clay \nlayers, the radicals which were produced through chain scission are trapped between the clay \nlayers and have more opportunity to undergo radical transfer and recombination reactions. In \nthe well dispersed nanocomposite a superheated environment was probable to occur in the \ninterior part of the nanocomposite when surrounding temperature keeps increasing during the \nTG run so some radicals and recombined molecules could undergo extensive random chain \nscission at any methylene linkages followed by \u03b2-scission, disproportionation or hydrogen \nabstraction, evolving various structures \u2013 Fig. 8. \n \nFig. 8 \n \nIf \u03b2-scission occurs, the evolved products contain unsaturation in every molecule. \nDisproportionation produces molecules that exhibit both unsaturation and saturation. \nHydrogen abstraction, presumably from the condensed phase, causes the production of more \nsaturated structures. Hence, significant production of 1,3-diphenyl propane was mainly \nthrough disproportionation due to the effect of clay presence. \nAdditionally, the colour and viscosity changes gave some information about the chemistry of \nPS nanocomposite degradation. In the presence of clay, the colour of solid residues darkened \nas the clay content increased. Hence, cross-linking, conjugated double bond formation or \ncarbonization, in the presence of clay could contribute to colour formation. However, the \ncross-linking reactions could not be an important factor since the viscosity of soluble fraction \nof solid residue after 40% mass loss decreased as the clay content increased. Most probably, \n 18\nthe conjugated double bond formation contributed to the dark colour of the residues of the PS \nnanocomposites and was an intermediate stage on the way to carbonization. \nWang et al. [63] have prepared acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene terpolymer (ABS)\/clay \nnanocomposites using a direct melt intercalation technique. High resolution transmission \nelectron microscopy (HTEM) results showed the ABS\/clay nanocomposites to be of \nintercalated-delaminated structure. The nanocomposites were found to enhance the formation \nof char, but the onset of weight loss of ABS\/clay nanocomposites occurred at a lower \ntemperature in comparison to neat ABS. This was partly blamed on the degradation of \nOMMT at lower temperature than that of pure ABS (Fig. 9).  \n \nFig. 9 \n \nABS\/clay nanocomposites gave a larger residue from the first step of degradation - ABS has \n86 wt. % mass loss, while ABS\/clay nanocomposites had 9 wt. % less mass loss than that of \npure ABS. It was further reported that after pyrolysis the nanocomposites formed a char with \na multilayered carbonaceous-silicate structure. XRD results, shown in Fig. 10, proved that the \ninorganic material still kept a multilayered structure at 600\u00b0C. \n \nFig. 10 \n \nThis high-performance carbonaceous-silicate char built up on the surface during burning - it \ninsulated the underlying material and slowed the escape of the volatile products generated \nduring decomposition. In the second step (500\u2013650\u00b0C), the relative loss of ABS\/clay \nnanocomposite was 72% - far less than that of original ABS, 98%. Thus, it was assumed that \nthe formation of the intercalated structure also influenced the second degradation step of \nABS\/clay nanocomposite in the char layer, and enhanced the stability of the ABS matrix. \nElsewhere, during investigations on properties of styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) clay \nnanocomposites Zhang and co-workers [64] observed that the thermal decomposition \ntemperatures of nanocomposites were higher comparing to pure polymer, however this \nadvantageous effect tend to decrease when increasing the clay content from 3 to 4 wt. %. \nAccording to authors this might be attributed to the slight phase separation with further \nintroduction of OMMT.  \nIn another study concerning styrene-acrylonitryle copolymer (SAN) nanocomposites \nresearchers looked into different organic treatments differing in polarity and thermal stability. \n 19\nAs a more thermal stable modifier for MMT than alkyl ammonium salts (e.g. dimethyl \nbis(hydrogenated tallow) ammonium (DMHTA), methyl tallow bis-2-hydroxyethyl \nammonium (MTBHA)), aromatic triphenyl n-hexadecyl phosphonium (TPHDP) and 1,2-\ndimethyl-3-n-hexadecyl imidazolium (DMHDI) were applied [65]. Most of the SAN \nnanocomposites exhibited better thermal stability than pristine SAN, namely; lower mass loss \nrate and higher decomposition peak temperature. The MMT introduction improved the \nthermal stability at higher temperature, however, it caused adverse effect on thermal stability \nat lower temperature. The TG data showed that all nanocomposites had a slightly early onset \nof decomposition. This was ascribed to the residual (excess) organic treatment on the clay \nsurface. It might also be due to thermal instability of the organic treatment, as alkyl \nammonium treatments are known to undergo degradation according to Hofmann mechanism \naround 200\u00b0C. Curiously enough, SAN nanocomposites made with MTBHA, DMHTA, and \nTPHDP treated fluorinated synthetic mica (FSM) or MMT had equivalent thermal stability. \nWhen only the clays were analyzed, the alkyl ammonium treated materials (MTBHA, \nDMHTA) showed the Hofmann\u2019s type of degradation behaviour at 200\u00b0C, whereby TPHDP \nand DMHDI clays showed onsets of decomposition around 225 and 240\u00b0C, respectively.  \nAn interesting observation was made on SAN nanocomposite materials in the TG test \nshowing whether or not the materials tested held their shape during the test and connected to \nthe degree of nanoparticles dispersion in the SAN matrix. Materials analysed by TG had held \ntheir shape and were validated by XRD and TEM data that showed then to be well-dispersed \nnanocomposites. And vice versa, materials that did not hold their shape were either \nmicrocomposites, or poorly dispersed nanocomposites. To study the effect of acrylonitrile \ncontent in SAN nanocomposites, the clay dispersion and thermal stability of two additional \nnanocomposites based on SAN copolymers containing less acrylonitrile (AN) content (15 and \n23%, respectively) were investigated. The analysis of structural features of nanocomposites, \nin principle, confirmed the hypothesis that while the DMHDI organic treatment preferred to \ninterface favourably with the phenyl ring in the styrene part of the SAN backbone, it did not \nprefer to interface with the polar acrylonitrile part of the SAN backbone, since TPHDP\u2013MMT \ndispersed poorly in these SAN resins compared with full 31% AN content SAN. Moreover, \nthe TPHDP\u2013MMT also showed a collapse of the organoclay interlayer distance suggesting \nthat these materials are most likely microcomposites. To the researchers it seemed that poor \ndispersion of MMT in this material induced thermal degradation at temperatures lower than \nobserved for other nanocomposites and even for pure SAN. \n 20\nAccording to the results of in situ vapour phase FTIR investigation the main evolved gas \nproducts contained vinyl, nitrile, and mono substituted benzene groups, along with some \naliphatic chains. The collected spectra implied that there were no differences in terms of \nfunctionality upon the formation of the nanocomposites. When studied by using the GC\/MS  \nmethod, the degradation behaviour of pure SAN seems to be very similar to polystyrene, \nwhich is chain scission followed by \u03b2-scission [66], producing monomers (m\/z 53, 104), \ndimers (m\/z 157, 208) and trimers (m\/z 210, 261, 312). The degradation pathway of SAN in \nits  nanocomposites with MMT exhibits more extensive random chain scission, yielding  \nadditional compounds having an odd number of carbons in the chain backbones (m\/z 118, \n173, 196), and radical recombination, producing head-to-head structures (m\/z 236, isomers of \nm\/z 261, etc.), but the peak intensities of the recombined products were smaller than those of \npolystyrene [67]. This trend may be caused by differences in the radical stability between \ndegrading SAN and PS. The tertiary radical adjacent to benzene ring is thought to be more \nstable than that adjacent to nitrile group [68], hence, as soon as the latter is produced, it \nundergoes either radical transfer (hydrogen transfer) or \u03b2-scission, producing relatively large \namounts of dimers and trimers compared to polystyrene. On the other hand, the radical \nadjacent to benzene ring is one of the more stable radicals, so it has more opportunity to \nundergo recombination reaction. \n \n5. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) \n \nIt is generally accepted that the decomposition of radically polymerized PMMA in \nnitrogen atmosphere consists of three stages: the first (100\u2013200\u00b0C) is ascribed to the rupture \nof weak head-to-head linkages in the main chain, the second (200\u2013300\u00b0C) is terminal vinyl \ngroup decomposition, and the third (300\u2013400\u00b0C) is due to the random scission of polymer \nmain chain [69]. While decomposing in the presence of oxygen, the first peak disappears and \nthe second peak either merges with the third peak or becomes a shoulder to the third peak \ndepending on the heating rate. This phenomenon has explained by the dual function of \noxygen in PMMA decomposition. At lower temperatures, oxygen inhibits PMMA \ndecomposition by reacting with a polymeric radical and forming a more stable new polymeric \nradical. At temperatures above 270\u00b0C, this new polymeric radical decomposes and releases a \nmore reactive radical resulting in the acceleration of PMMA decomposition [70].   \nImprovement in the thermal stability of PMMA nanocomposites have been on the \nspotlight of current research and was reported by many authors [71,72]. However, the \n 21\nresearch found MMT to have different efficiency in improving the thermal stability of \nPMMA, e.g. the 5%-weight-loss temperature reported by Blumstein for PMMA\/OMMT was \naround 265\u00b0C, which was lower than the temperature observed for PMMA\u2013Na+-MMT \nhybrids in Kumar\u2019s study [72]. It was reported elsewhere [63] that the PMMA \nmicrocomposites with the unmodified MMT exhibited 20 wt. % loss at 280\u00baC while the \nnanocomposites showed increase in the decomposition temperature at 20 wt. % loss by 15 \u2013 \n50 \u00baC. Another research group [73] followed similar pathway for the synthesis [63,72]  but \nfound thermal degradation temperatures of PMMA\/MMT nanocomposites 10-90\u00baC higher in \ncomparison with the PMMA\/MMT microcomposites for the same weight loss which was \nattributed to the improved interaction between the PMMA and clay after the pretreatment of \nthe clay with cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC). Similar changes in routes of thermal \ndegradation of polymeric matrix in PMMA\/MMT nanocomposites were seen when \norganomodifier containing vinylbenzyl groups was used [55]. As a result, the onset \ntemperature of the degradation increased by about between 50 and 100\u00b0C for PMMA\u2013clay \nnanocomposites. \nIn Zhu et al. work [74], three ammonium salts, hexadecylallyldimethyl ammonium \nchloride (Ally16), hexadecylvinylbenzyldimethyl ammonium chloride (VB16) and \nhexadecylvinylbenzyldimethyl ammonium chloride (Bz16) were synthesized and ion \nexchanged onto MMT. The study reported that the presence of the clay did not affect the \ndegradation process of PMMA - PMMA and its nanocomposites showed three degradation \nsteps, except for the VB16 nanocomposite in which the first step disappeared. The char \nformation did not increase, which was consistent with previous works [51]. The TG curves \n(Fig. 11) for the nanocomposites showed that the initial step of the degradation, which \nKashiwagi [75,76] attributed to the presence of weak links in the polymer chain, occurred at \nlower temperatures for Allyl16 and Bz16 and was absent in VB16.  \n \nFig. 11 \n \nThe intensity of this first step decreased in the presence of the clay but it occurred at a lower \ntemperature \u2013 this suggestion is in agreement with early studies by Blumstein [77] who \nproposed that the clay offers some templating effect. The second and third steps in the \ndegradation occurred at about the same point but the temperature at 50% degradation was \nsignificantly higher and the nanocomposites had enhanced thermal stability. \n 22\nReferring to the GC analysis of virgin PMMA and the PMMA\/clay nanocomposite, no \ndifferences were observed [23]. Both materials underwent thermal degradation through \u03b2-\nscission at the chain ends (unzipping) to produce the monomer. This implies that neither a \nradical transfer, which is the pathway for the evolution of dimer and trimer, nor \nintermolecular reaction occur. This fact was connected with the stability of the radicals that \nare produced during the decomposition of polymer. Contrary to PS and EVA exhibiting \nnoticeable differences in evolved products of degradation in the presence of MMT where the \nallylic radical in EVA and the styryl radical in styrene-containing polymers are the most \nstable, the radicals formed during PMMA degradation have rather low stability therefore there \nis small probability that radicals that are produced may undergo secondary reactions. In Qu et \nal. it was shown that in PMMA nanocomposites synthesized by in situ polymerization the \nratios of termination by disproportionation in relation to recombination increased with the \naddition of MMT [78]. Since the stability of the polymer formed by recombination of radical \nspecies will be around 190\u00b0C, while polymer chains containing the unsaturated and saturated  \nend-groups formed in disproportionation reaction should be around 255\u00b0C and >300\u00b0C, \nrespectively, the changes in termination mechanism of free radical polymerization by MMT \ncould be responsible for thermal stability enhancement of PMMA-clay nanocomposites. \n \n6. Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) \n \nRecent publications by Gong et al. [79] were devoted to poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC)\/MMT \nnanocomposites that were prepared by in situ polymerization method. Similar to pure PVC, \nthe nanocomposites revealed two-stage degradation in TG experiment - the first stage \ncorresponds to the evolution of hydrogen chloride resulting in the formation of the conjugated \npolyene sequences, and the following stage is attributed to the thermal cracking of the \ncarbonaceous conjugated polyene sequences (Fig. 12).  \n \nFig. 12 \n \nThe degradation process of PVC nanocomposites was modified both in the first and the \nsecond stage. The initial mass loss occurred at lower temperatures comparing to pristine \npolymer. However, the temperature at maximum rate of mass loss was enhanced with respect \nto pure PVC and the formation of residue was noticeably increased. As in other studies on \nthermal stability of PVC nanocomposites with layered silicates, the presence of the quaternary \n 23\nammonium (dimethyl didodecyl ammonium chloride (DDAC)) in the nanocomposites was \nfound to be responsible for the acceleration of the polymer decomposition in the initial stage. \nThe quaternary ammonium salt decomposed following the Hofmann degradation mechanism.  \nIt was previously proved that the presence of H+ and HCl may (auto)catalyze the \ndehydrochlorination of the PVC chains [80]. However, as the process of nanocomposite \ndegradation proceeded, the rate of mass loss was decreasing gradually. This was more likely \nattributable to the presence of MMT layers offering a barrier effect to hinder the formation of \nsmall molecules and their escape from nanocomposites. Under the naked eyes, it was \nobserved that with increasing nanofiller content the ability of nanocomposites to keep the \nprimary shape and form a compact surface during heating was significantly enhanced, while \npure PVC samples tended to expand and form porous surface. The FTIR analysis of char \nformed during heating confirmed the carbonaceous nature of the residue, which took an \nimportant protective role in the PVC chains degradation. Thus the decomposition rate of the \nnanocomposites was slowed down and the maximum decomposition temperature was \nincreased. However, in the case of PVC nanocomposites, where rigid-rod aromatic amine \nmodifier (Fig. 13) was applied to modify bentonite, the onset thermal decomposition \ntemperature was slightly increased - from 295\u00b0C for PVC to 305\u00b0C when the OMMT content \nwas below 1 wt. % [81].  \n \nFig. 13 \n \nIn another development, Wan et al. [82] investigations into PVC\/organic MMT \nnanocomposites revealed that when organic MMT loading amounted to 5 wt. %, the \ncomposites became deep yellow in colour and processing stability deteriorated, which meant \nthat PVC began to degrade and discolour during the processing. This meant that high organic \nMMT contents had adverse effects on the thermal stability during melt processing, especially \nabove 3 wt. % content. One of the explanations given was that the pure alkylammonium salts \nbegan to decompose at 230\u00baC under nitrogen atmosphere, while organic MMT particles began \nto change colour from original white to yellow at around 185\u00baC in air. Ren and co-workers \nfound that with the increase of OMMT content, the degradation of PVC  became more serious \nleading to the decrease of mechanical properties and concluded that the OMMT content \nshould be kept at 1 phr to realize good processing stability and mechanical properties [83]. \nIvan et al. [84] have reported that PVC has the lowest thermal stability of all carbon chain \npolymers. Thus, the allylic and tertiary chlorines of PVC chains were the main labile \n 24\n(\u2018irregular\u2019) sites, at which the decomposition process starts. When the mass loss due to \ndehydrochlorination reached only 0.1%, sequences of conjugated double bonds formed and \nresulted in discoloration of PVC.  \n \n7. Polyesters \n \nPolyester-based nanocomposites are considered as novel materials with promising \nproperties for e.g. packaging applications. Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) nanocomposites \nare often prepared at elevated temperatures to above 280\u00b0C for in situ intercalation and bulk \nprocessing [52,53,85,86]. Since the thermal stability of organoclays with alkyl ammonium \ncations has caused severe problems during processing of PET, much research has been \ndirected toward the preparation of organoclays that are thermally stable at high temperatures. \nFor instance, Takekoshi et al. [87] prepared polyester\/clay nanocomposites through in situ \npolymerization with high levels of dispersion and improved physical properties; however, a \nmore commercially viable approach with conventional polymer processing led to clay poorly \ndispersed in polymer matrix. The researchers attributed this phenomenon to the low \ndecomposition temperature (250\u00b0C) of the organic modifier bound to the clay surface. \nMoreover, Matayabas et al. [88] prepared PET nanocomposites by melt-compounding \nvarying amounts of Claytone APA, a commercial high-polarity organoclay, with a 1,4-\ncyclohexanedimethanol modified PET. Physical mixtures of the organically modified clay \nand PET copolymer (co-PET) were dried under vacuum at 120\u00b0C before extrusion at 280\u00b0C. \nThe result was a decrease in the co-PET inherent viscosity, indicating degradation. This \ndegradation increased in severity as the clay content increased from 0.36 to 7 wt %. In an \nattempt to compensate for the degradation, a higher-molecular weight PET was used, but \nunfortunately this led to more severe degradation.  \nAn antagonistic effect of clay activity was observed in poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT)  \nnanocomposites [89]. The clay layers acted as a superior insulator and as a mass\u2013transport \nbarrier to the volatile products generated during decomposition, increasing thus the thermal \nstability. On the other hand, the catalytic activity centres in clay layers, such as those around  \nhydroxyl groups, might accelerate the decomposition of the polyester [90]. As a result, the \ntotal impact of nanoadditive on thermal stability of PBT was not significant. \nFurther, hexadecylamine organoclay was successfully dispersed in poly(ethylene \nterephthalate-co-ethylene naphthalate) (PETN) when nanofiller content did not exceed 4 wt. \n% [91]. However, the tendency to form agglomerated structures in the polymer matrix at 6 wt. \n 25\n% clay content occurred. The observed changes in structure were simultaneously reflected in \nthermal stability (initial degradation temperature) confirming that hybrids with a good \ndispersion of organoclay are more thermally stable, though, the maximum decomposition \ntemperatures of all the nanocomposites remained constant, regardless of the organoclay \nloading. Similarly to previously mentioned PET\/clay nanocomposite investigations \n[52,53,85,86], the researchers also emphasized the role of strong interaction between the \norganoclay and PETN molecules that increased the thermal resistance of nanocomposites. \nSuch interactions were introduced by adding sodium sulfonate functionalized PBT into PET \nthat caused exfoliation of MMT during extrusion [92]. Since high degree of exfoliation is \nknown to be an important factor in thermal stability improvement, the proposed procedure of \npolymer matrix modification should be considered as a useful route towards PET \nnanocomposites with increased thermal resistance. \nMost recently, Chang et al. [93] reported that in addition to having the same melting point \nand heat of melting, the PET nanocomposites with 0\u20133 wt. % dodecyl triphenyl phosphonium \nchloride modified MMT (C12PPh\u2013MMT) showed improved thermal degradation properties. \nTG results showed that the initial thermal degradation temperature of the C12PPh\u2013MMT\/PET \nhybrid fibres increased with the amount of organoclay. The initial thermal degradation \ntemperature at 2%  mass loss was observed at 370\u2013385\u00b0C for clay compositions from 0 to 3 \nwt. % in the PET hybrids, with a maximum increase of 15\u00b0C in the case of the 3 wt. % \nC12PPh\u2013MMT\/PET as compared to that for pure PET. The weight of the residue at 600\u00b0C \nincreased with clay loading from 0 to 3%, ranging from 1 to 21%. This enhancement of char \nformation was ascribed to the high heat resistance exerted by the clay itself. For 3 wt. % \norganoclay in the PET hybrid fibres, the overall thermal properties of the PET hybrid fibres \nwere unchanged for different draw ratios from 1 to 16.  \nStudies by Liu et al. [94] indicated that inhomogeneous dispersion leads to non-systematic  \nchanges in onset temperature of degradation of poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT)\/18C-\nMMT and the PTT\/12C-MMT nanocomposites, which was caused by inhomogeneous \ndispersion of the two organoclays. Takekoshi et al. [87] study produced PET nanocomposites \nwith N,N-dimethyl-N,N-dioctadecylammonium treated MMT (DMDODA-MMT), which has \na decomposition temperature of 250\u00b0C. The residues were black, brittle, and tarlike resulting \nfrom DMDODA degradation under the processing conditions. PET nanocomposites \ncompounded with 1,2-dimethyl-3-N-hexadecyl imidazolium treated MMT, which has a \ndecomposition temperature of 350\u00b0C, showed high levels of dispersion and delamination. The \nimidazolium-based organic modifiers were thermally stable at the processing conditions. \n 26\n  A different study concerning the degradation behaviour of copolyesters with \nphosphorous linkage in the main chain synthesized in condensation reaction of terephthalic \nacid (TPA), ethyleneglycol (EG) and 2-carboxyethyl(phenylphosphinic) acid (CEPP) (PET-\nco-CEPP) and phosphorous linked pendant groups (PET-co-DDP), where as a copolymer \n9,10-dihydro-10[2,3-di(hydroxycarbonyl)propyl]10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide (DDP) \nwas used, reported the increase of the activation energy of degradation resulting from the \nintroduction of MMT [95,96]. The synthesis of phosphorus-containing copolyesters from \nterephthalic acid and ethylene glycol as well as CEPP and DDP as comonomers was meant to \nimprove the flame retardancy; however, it turned out that PET copolymers had lower onset \ntemperature of degradation denoted as temperature at 5% mass loss (T5%) and temperature of \nmaximum mass loss (Tmax) than that of pure PET. For the nanocomposite of PET copolymer \n(1.8 wt. % of phosphorous and 2 wt. % of inorganic MMT content), it had higher T5% and \nTmax than PET-co-DDP, suggesting that MMT can enhance the thermal stability of \nphosphorous-containing copolyesters. Moreover, the activation energy of decomposition \ndetermined using Kissinger, Ozawa-Flynn-Wall and Friedman methods, was increased. \n \n8. Polyimide \n \nLiang et al. [97] studied the thermal properties of photosensitive polyimide (PI)\/MMT \nnanocomposites with various MMT contents. The onset thermal decomposition temperature \nand temperatures at 5% and 10% weight loss were increased with the increase of MMT \ncontent. For example, the onset thermal decomposition temperature assessed by TGA was \nincreased from 515\u00b0C for PI to 540\u00b0C for PI\/MMT nanocomposite containing 3 wt. % of \nMMT. MMT possessed high thermal stability and its layer structure exhibited great barrier \neffect to hinder the evaporation of the small molecules generated during the thermal \ndecomposition, limiting the continuous degradation of the PI matrix. \nIn another research work [98], TG profiles for soluble polyimide (SPI) and soluble \nnanocomposite membranes prepared by chemical imidization, as measured under an air \natmosphere, showed two major weight losses in the range of 100\u2013300\u00b0C and at 500\u00b0C. The \nfirst noted weight loss was assigned to the evaporation of the N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) \nsolvent. The major weight loss at 500\u2013700\u00b0C was attributed to the structural decomposition of \nthe polymer shifted slightly toward the higher temperature under addition of MMT. Similarly, \nthe thermal stability of bulk PI (insoluble PI system) also showed enhancement after the \nincorporation of clay platelets. It was noted that the char yield of insoluble PI was \n 27\nsignificantly higher than that of SPI, indicating that the insoluble PI may show enhanced \nflame resistant property relative to SPI. \n \n9. Epoxy resins \n \nIn one development, TG studies on both the onium ion intercalated clays and the \nepoxy\/clay nanocomposites made from these clays found out that the thermal stability of the \nnanocomposites was not greatly compromised by the presence of the long chain organic \nmodifier [99]. Of interest, the Jeffamine onium ions underwent facile thermal decomposition, \npresumably according to the Hofmann mechanism, when intercalated into MMT and \nfluorohectorite clays. However, there was no indication of onium ion degradation in the cured \npolymer\/clay nanocomposites, whether the clay nanolayers were exfoliated or not. In Becker \net al. [100] investigation into epoxy layered silicate nanocomposites, a slightly decreased \nonset temperature with increasing organoclay concentration for the tetrafunctional \ntetraglycidyldiaminodiphenylmethane (TGDDM) nanocomposites was observed. A similar \ntrend was shown for the peak degradation temperature of the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A \n(DGEBA) and triglycidyl p-amino phenol (TGAP) nanocomposites. Values for TGDDM, \nhowever, showed some scatter around a value of about 380\u00b0C rather than a constant trend of \ndecreasing temperatures with clay addition. The interval between degradation onset and end \nshowed a slight trend of broadening for the DGEBA and TGAP nanocomposites. However, \nthis was not observed for the TGDDM nanocomposites and was not consistent with the \nreduced onset and peak degradation temperatures. It was noted that TG traces of resin systems \nwith and without organoclay generally showed the same behaviour in the lower temperature \nregime of degradation, with the degradation of the compatibilizer starting at about 200\u00b0C. A \nseparate degradation of the interlayer exchanged ions was not observed, however, it was \nfound that the organo-ion concentrations were very low, ca. 25\u201330 wt. % of the treated clay \nfraction. This led to assumption that the interlayer exchanged ions were well embedded or \nincorporated into the polymer matrix. This is in good agreement with the degradation \nbehaviour observed for other exfoliated epoxy organoclay nanocomposites by Wang and \nPinnavaia [101] and Gu and Liang [102] who recently found that onset temperatures of \ndegradation were also lowered, especially in the case of the longer alkyl ammonium chains. \nLikewise, the potential reasons leading to lower glass transition temperatures, such as low \ncrosslink density and plasticization of the epoxy matrix by the organo-ion, were also likely to \nhave led to greater degrees of degradation. \n 28\nBecker et al. [100] studies on surface modification of MMT and thermal stability of \nepoxy\/clay nanocomposites noted that although the total weight loss of epoxy\/clay \nnanocomposites is not generally in direct proportion with the amount of clay added, a trend of \nreduced weight loss or improved char formation was observed with organoclay addition. \nWhen comparing pristine epoxy and 10% layered silicate-containing nanocomposite, the \nadditional weight of the remaining char was in good correlation to the inorganic content of the \nfiller given that the organoclay cations were roughly one third of the clay additive. The \nnanocomposites showed slight indications of reduced thermal stability, as displayed by a \ndecreased onset in thermal degradation in the order of 5 \u2013 10\u00b0C at a clay concentration of \n10%. The final char concentration was increased with increasing organoclay concentrations. \nThe changes in thermal stability were of very low significance and it was unlikely that they \nwould be considered as a drawback to any possible industrial application. Other work by cone \ncalorimetry indicated that significant decreases in heat release rate occurred upon addition of \nnanoclays [103,104], however it is often necessary to combine the clays with other additives \nin order to obtain the required synergies and flame retardancy desired [105].   \nThe influence of nanoreinforcement on thermal stability of an epoxy resin (diglycidyl \nether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) polymerized with a methyl tetrahydrophthalic anhydride) was \ninvestigated by Torre and co-workers [106]. The overall degradation process in inert \natmosphere was not strongly affected by the presence of the nanoparticles, however, the \nstabilizing role of MMT was visible during degradation in the presence of oxidizing gases. \nFurthermore, it was noticed that the presence of the accelerator (imidazole) in the \nnanocomposite formulation caused a decrease of the degradation performance of the material \nin an inert atmosphere. This phenomenon was attributed to the effect of the surfactant, which, \nin the nanocomposite polymerized with imidazole, exposed more surfaces and could catalyze \nthe decomposition. \n \n10. Polyurethanes \n \nThe thermal degradation of polyurethanes (PU) occurs in two stages: the first stage is \nmainly governed by the degradation of the hard segments and the second stage correlates well \nwith the degradation of the soft segments [107-110]. The nanocomposites with improved \ndispersion of organoclay showed the onset temperature of degradation (Tonset), the temperature \nof maximum decomposition rate for the first stage (Tmax1) and that for the second stage (Tmax2) \nabout 10 \u00baC higher than pristine PU. The highest thermal stability was observed for the \n 29\nOMMT content of 5 wt. % and its Tonset, Tmax1 and Tmax2 were about 30, 35 and 65 \u00baC higher \nthan those of pure PU. Moreover, Choi et al. [111] showed that the effect of clay as thermal \ninsulator and mass transport barrier on thermal stability can be increased with improving the \ndispersibility of organoclay in polyurethane matrix.  In this study clay was modified with high \nmolecular weight compound with hydroxyl end-groups, then dispersed in DMF and the \ndispersibility of organoclay in polyurethane matrix was enhanced by applying the sonication.  \nIn Song et al. [112]  study on PU - layered silicate nanocomposites based on \npolyether, toluene diisocyanate, diglycol (as a chain extender) and glycerine (as a crosslinking \nagent), a decrease in onset temperature of decomposition was ascribed to catalytic effect of \nOMMT. The introduction of organosilicate led to enhanced depolycondensation of \nmacromolecular matrix in the initial stage of degradation; however, the overall rate of mass \nloss was diminished. An attempt was made to improve the thermal stability of PU \nnanocomposites at temperatures around Tonset by introducing the melamine polyphosphate \n(MPP). Thermal degradation of MPP takes place at about 360\u00baC \u2013 it releases NH3 and H2O \nand generates highly crosslinked unidentified polyphosphoric acid derivatives containing P-N \nlinkages. Although there was an obvious synergic effect between the retardance of the thermal \ndecomposition and enhancement of carbonaceous char formation, which occurred between \nOMMT and MPP, the catalytic effect of OMMT was still found. It was suggested that \ncatalysis of the phosphoric acid also accelerated the depolycondensation reaction. \nIn another development, PU\/MMT nanocomposites, based on thermally stable, aromatic \namine modifier containing active groups (methylene-bis-ortho-chloroanilline, (MOCA)), were \nsynthesized by intercalative polymerization [113]. The cured hybrid exhibited higher thermal \nstability and better mechanical strength than pure PU or PU\/cetyltrimethylammonium-\nbromide (CTAB)-modified MMT (PU\/C16-MMT). The main reason for different behaviour \nof nanocomposites was the different structure of the modifiers. The aromatic chain of MOCA \nhas higher thermal stability compared to alkyl chain of CTAB. On the other hand, compared \nwith the CTAB, MOCA modifier, as a chain extender, could react with the pre-polyurethane \nmatrix, further strengthening the interaction between inorganic and organic phase. As a result, \nmodifier molecules (MOCA) in the PU\/MMT were connected with PU by covalent bonds and \nbecome a constituent part of the polyurethane, while the alkyl chain of CTAB and PU \npermeated with each other and formed a thin interface in the PU\/C16-MMT. Lastly, Takeichi \net al. [114] reported the improvement in thermal stability of poly(urethane-benzoxazine) (PU-\nPa) nanocomposites with OMMT that was suggested to be based on two effects: first, part of \nthe thermally decomposed volatiles was captured by OMMT; second, the efficient cure of \n 30\nbenzoxazine monomer (Pa), from the catalytic effect of OMMT on the ring-opening \npolymerization, resulted in higher crosslink density of PU-Pa. \n \n11. Ethylene\u2013propylene\u2013diene terpolymer (EPDM) \n \nThe role of thermal stability of organic modifier during preparation of nanocomposites \nwas also pointed by Acharya and co-workers in a work on ethylene\u2013propylene\u2013diene \nterpolymer (EPDM) nanocomposites [115]. Hexadecyl ammonium salt was chosen as an \norganic modifier. The resulted nanocomposites (obtained by a solution blending method) \nexhibited exfoliated structure at clay content below 2 wt. % and mostly intercalated structure \nat higher contents of organosilicates. Interestingly, in intercalated nanocomposites a shift of \nbasal 2\u03b8 peak of organophilic clay in the EPDM matrix from 4.5 to 5.5\u00b0 was observed, which \nreflected the reduction of the silicate gallery distance. According to the researchers, such a \ndecrease in d-spacing of silicate layers of MMT dispersed in the EPDM matrix could be \nattributed to the partial decomposition of the hexadecyl ammonium and expulsion of the \nammonium salt, leading to the collapse of the organoclay layered structure. This hypothesis \nwas confirmed by XRD analysis of the organomodified clay that underwent thermal \ntreatment, where the basal reflection peak was also similarly shifted. The work observed \nsignificant improvement in thermal stability corresponding to the onset temperature of \ndegradation (Tonset) for 2 wt. % mass loss that was raised from 325\u00b0C for neat EPDM to \n375\u00b0C for 8 wt. % OMMT content in EPDM nanocomposites. This was ascribed to the \npresence of silicate layers, hindering the formation of small molecules, resulting from thermal \ndecomposition, and simultaneously resisting their movement and desorption from the surface. \nAlso the restriction of the thermal motion of EPDM segments could bring higher thermal \nresistance of hybrid material. Since the interfacial interactions play an important role in that \nprocess, the coexistence of intercalated and exfoliated silicate layers in the EPDM matrix, \nwhich increased the Si\u2013O\u2013C interactions, could be profitable. Furthermore, it was noticed that \nthe final thermal decomposition temperature (Tf) at about 460\u00b0C remains more or less the \nsame, irrespective of the OMMT content in EPDM, suggesting that silicate layers were \nincapable of holding the polymer chains within themselves. \n \n12. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) \n \n 31\nInvestigations in to thermal degradation of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)\u2013clay \nnanocomposite materials  found out that major weight losses were observed in the range of \n200\u2013500\u00b0C for pure PVA and its nanocomposites, which might have corresponded to the \nstructural decomposition of the polymer [116]. Evidently, the thermal decomposition of those \nhybrid materials shifted slightly toward the higher temperature range than that of PVA, which \nconfirmed the enhancement of thermal stability of intercalated polymer. After 600\u00b0C, the \nmain products were mainly the inorganic residue (i.e. Al2O3, MgO, SiO2). From the amount \nof the residue at 900\u00b0C, the inorganic contents in the original nanocomposite materials could \nbe obtained. \nChang et al. [117] also observed slight enhancement in the thermal stability for PVA \nnanocomposites - the initial decomposition temperature at a 2 wt. % loss for the hybrids was \n7\u201315\u00b0C higher than that of pure PVA. The analysis of the amount of char formed during \ndegradation lead to the conclusion that the organic alkyl groups of alkyl ammonium ion-\nexchanged clays thermally decomposed more easily than hybrids of sodium clays did. \n \n13. Polylactide \n \nDifferent thermal behaviour in inert and oxidative conditions of polylactide\/MMT \nnanocomposites was reported by Pluta and co-workers [118]. Under helium degradation \ntemperature of nanocomposites was increased by about 10\u00b0C, while increase by 25\u00b0C was \nobserved under air. On the other hand, the microcomposites exhibited similar thermal \nresistance both in helium and air. Therefore, the improved thermal stability of nanocomposite \nmaterials was ascribed to the difference in morphologic features of both materials. TG \nanalysis performed on the poly(L-lactide)\/OMMT  by Paul et al. [119] showed the weight \nloss due to the volatilisation of degradation by-products was monitored as a function of \ntemperature increased, and also showed an increase of the thermal stability of the polymer \nmatrix, when filled with a small amount of nanoclay as low as 3 wt. %. Depending on the \ntype of filler (the presence and nature of the alkylammonium cations, length of the alkyl chain \nor functionality of the ammonium cation), this effect was pronounced in nanocomposites \ncontaining Na+-MMT, triggering greater thermal stability improvement where the main \nprocess of degradation was shifted towards higher temperature by 40\u00b0C.  These characteristics \nwere related to the structure of the nanocomposite and have already been reported for other \nlayered silicate nanocomposites based on matrices such as PA 6 [120], PS [51], ethylene\u2013\nvinyl acetate copolymers [121] or poly(L-caprolactone) [122] filled with various types of \n 32\nOMMTs. In fact, the layers of organo-modified phyllosilicates were thought to increase the \ndiffusion pathway of the combustion by-products, as they are impermeable to such \ncomponents [123]. \n \n14. Summary \n \nIn a number of investigations montmorillonite was showed to significantly affect the \nthermal stability of polymers as well as alter the structure and concentration of decomposition \nproducts both in evolved gases and condensed phase. The advantageous influence of clay on \nthermal stability of polymers clearly depends on the degree of intercalation\/exfoliation of clay \nlayers \u2013 the better dispersion of nanofiller is achieved, the more significant enhancement of \nthermal resistance could be expected.  \nTwo opposing activities of the organoclay occurred in some polymeric nanocomposites \ninfluencing the thermal stability of material - one was increasing a barrier properties  \n(\u2018labyrinth effect\u2019) and insulating properties to heat transport of nanocomposite that should \nimprove the thermal stability, and the other is the catalytic effect towards the degradation of \nthe polymer matrix which would decrease the thermal stability. The products of thermal \ndecomposition of organic modifier influence the polymer properties, for example the acidic \nsites occurring on MMT layer after volatilization of organomodifier are able to accelerate the \ndecomposition of polymer. Furthermore, the compounds that are absorbed on MMT surface, \nsuch as water, for some polymers (e.g. polyamides, polyesters, polyurethanes) could initiate \nhydrolysis. Low molecular weight compounds absorbed in polymer matrix may cause \ndeterioration of the mechanical performance of composite material.  \nMoreover, the results of recent systematic studies showed that the clay activity towards \nthermal stabilization of polymers depends on the intrinsic properties of polymer matrix, and \nmore specifically, on the routes of polymer degradation. In a case of polymeric \nnanocomposites that exhibited improved thermal stability and\/or fire retardancy significant \nintermolecular reactions occurred, such as inter-chain aminolysis\/acidolysis, radical \nrecombination and hydrogen abstraction. New products in gaseous and condensed phase are \nthen formed following additional degradation pathways. It can be accepted that in the \npresence of MMT layers acting as a barrier to heat and mass transport first more extensive \nrandom scission of polymer chain occurs due to superheated conditions in the condensed \nphase. Then chemical species, trapped between MMT layers, have more opportunity to \nundergo further intermolecular reactions, such as radical recombination. The intermolecular \n 33\nreactions lead to the formation of complex compounds thus lowering the volatilization rate \nand favour the char formation process. Interestingly, it was showed that the influence of \nMMT on the thermal stability and fire retardancy of polymers depends on the degradation \npathways of the polymer - some of them could be promoted in the presence of MMT. For \npolymers that undergo thermal degradation according to the radical mechanism, the different \nefficiency of MMT in improving thermal behaviour can be connected with the stability of \nradical compounds produced by the polymer - the radical species with higher stability are \nmore probable to undergo radical recombination reactions.  \nDifferent effects were observed for thermo-oxidation and degradation in pyrolytic \nconditions. On the basis of observed changes in degradation routes of polymers it was found \nthat the \u2018labyrinth effect\u2019 of dispersed MMT is responsible for restricted diffusion of oxygen \ninto polymer matrix and causes pyrolytic-like conditions inside nanostructured composite \nmaterial. \n 34\n \nReferences \n \n[1]  K.
