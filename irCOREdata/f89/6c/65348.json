Introduction \nConsider the following events which have occurred in the last twenty-five years: 9\/11, the rise of \nSMS text messaging, the predominance of Google, the collapse of share prices on 19 October 1987, \nBlack Monday, and the global financial melt-down of 2008. All of them are characterised have two \nattributes in common: they took most people by surprise and they have had a large impact on the \nlives of many people. But did these events have a low level of predictability? Predictability can be \nviewed from two perspectives: i) our ability to arrive at reliable or well-calibrated probabilities, and \nii) the dispersion of the underlying probability distribution. If well-calibrated probabilities can be \nestablished, decision theory can be used to indicate how to make rational decisions on the basis of \nthem, even if the dispersion of the underlying probability distribution is large (Goodwin & Wright, \n2004). The problem of low predictability therefore arises: i) when it is not possible to arrive at well-\ncalibrated probabilities, and\/or ii) when it is not possible to measure calibration, so that one cannot \nassess the level of confidence that one should attribute to probabilities. This means that \nunpredictability is a major concern in relation to unique, unprecedented, or rare events which, if they \noccur, will have a high impact. In particular, there is the potential to underestimate the probabilities \nof these events by implicitly, or even explicitly, assigning to them extremely low probabilities or \nprobabilities of zero. Moreover, an absence of past data means that the calibration (or reliability) of \nsuch probabilities cannot be assessed, so any biases associated with them will not be recognised. We \nwill first examine the potential reasons why the predictability of specific high-impact events may be \nlow. Then we evaluate the effectiveness of the scenario method \u2013 a method that attempts to avoid \nthese problems by excluding a direct consideration of probabilities. Having identified the \nweaknesses of the scenario method, we then discuss potential improvements. \n \n2. Reasons for low predictability \n2.1. Inappropriate framing \n 4 \nThe way in which a decision or planning problem is framed, or viewed, will determine the extent to \nwhich account is taken of the different uncertainties that may impinge on the problem. Research \nsuggests that planners and decision makers often have overly narrow frames of reference, or frames \nthat are too embedded in the past \u2013 so that inadequate attention is paid to changes and the potential \nthreats and opportunities that these may represent. For example, in one study it was found that \nScottish textile producers saw other Scottish companies as their main competitors, despite the fact \nthat foreign companies represented their most serious challenge (Porac, Thomas, & Baden-Fuller, \n1989). At the extreme, an important threat or opportunity may go totally unrecognised (de facto, a \nzero probability is given to its occurrence), with the result that the organisation is totally unprepared \nwhen the event occurs. Incomplete, inaccurate, and otherwise inappropriate mental models may \n\u201cprevent managers from sensing problems, delay changes in strategy, and lead to action that is \nineffective in a new environment\u201d (Barr, Stimpert, & Huff, 1992). In times of rapid change, Wack \n(1985) contends, strategic failure \u201cis often caused by a crisis of perception, that is, the inability to see \nan emergent novel reality by being locked inside obsolete assumptions, particularly in large, well-\nrun companies\u201d. Further evidence of inappropriate framing comes from Johnson\u201fs (1987) single \nlongitudinal case study of the UK retail clothing industry. The focus of the study was on the \n(mis)match between changes in the firm\u201fs strategy as it sought to succeed in a changing \nenvironment, the objective of the study being to identify whether incremental changes in strategy \nwere beneficial or harmful to the overall survival and success. The study concluded that market \nsignals of a failing strategy were not interpreted as such within the organisation, and that managers \nin a previously successful business sought to reduce the perceived importance of dissonant \ninformation, such that the prevailing strategy was not threatened. Johnson showed that the resultant \nincremental change in strategy did not keep pace with environmental change, leading ultimately to \nstrategic drift. The objective sensing of external signals, it was reasoned, is muted within the \norganisation because the signals are not meaningful in themselves, but take on relevance from the \n 5 \nviewpoint of the manager\u201fs mental model. This so-called frame blindness can lead to effort being \nwasted in forecasting the wrong events, or predictions being based on erroneous assumptions about \nthe nature of the real world.  \n \nExperts in many fields are particularly susceptible to the adoption of particular frames which are \nconsistent with their specialism or prejudices, so we should be somewhat sceptical of the confidence \nlevels assigned to their forecasts (Armstrong, 1980; Tetlock, 2005). Indeed, in a huge study of \napproximately 28,000 predictions made by approximately 280 experts that were related to the \npolitical and economic futures of approximately 60 countries, Tetlock found that experts usually \nfared no better than simple statistical models. Moreover, Tetlock found that experts usually fail to \nquestion their own frames when evidence emerges that their forecasts are wrong. Instead, they have \na developed an impressive ability to explain away their errors by redefining inaccurate forecasts as \nrelatively accurate: \u201cthe forecasted event almost occurred\u201d or \u201cOK, the event has not happened yet, \nbut it will\u201d or \u201cmy timing was just off\u201d. In addition, Tetlock found that the experts were less likely to \nchange their views than non-experts, despite compelling evidence to the contrary. \n \n2.2. Cognitive and motivational biases \nWhen judgment is used in the prediction task, cognitive biases can lead to low predictability. These \nbiases can emanate from forecasters\u201f use of heuristics like availability and representativeness \n(Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) or they can be the result of optimism or wishful thinking. For \nexample, Fildes et al. (2008) found that judgmental adjustments to statistical point forecasts by \nmanagers in four UK companies suffered from the inefficient use of available information and \noptimism bias. Some research has focussed on methods for de-biasing judgmental assessments, but it \nhas become generally accepted that, although the probability assessor could be made aware of \npotential bias, the amelioration of bias is less straightforward. At the same time, other studies have \n 6 \ndemonstrated excellent calibration in judgmental probability assessments \u2013 most notably in weather \nforecasts (see Orrell & McSharry, this issue). Bolger and Wright (1994) and Rowe and Wright \n(2001) argued that the short, non-confounded, prediction-outcome-feedback loop that is found in \nweather forecasting may be ideal for developing well-calibrated assessments in judgemental \nprobability forecasting. Of course, in many decision and planning situations involving the prediction \nof unique or rare events, such enabling conditions for well-calibrated judgement do not exist. Here, \njudgmental prediction may be poor whilst at the same time judgmental forecasts may be \noverconfident \u2013 with such overconfidence exacerbated by hindsight bias (Fischhoff, 1975). \n \nEvents like 9\/11 and the collapse of Enron are novel and one-off and hence will lack a suitable \nreference class of similar events. However, Bazerman and Watkins (2008) have argued that these \nwere \u201epredictable surprises\u201f in that key decision makers \u201ehad all the data and insight they needed to \nrecognize the potential for, and even the inevitability of, a crisis\u201f. Note that such predictable \nsurprises are not examples of the operation of the hindsight bias, since bias is prevalent at the time of \nthe prediction rather than being inherent in later, misjudged, recollections of accurate predictions. \nBazerman and Watkins suggest that the problem with these types of events is a failure to act on the \ninformation and insight because the costs of implementing the necessary actions in the present loom \nlarge when compared with the \u201evague\u201f benefits of reducing the probability of a disaster in the future. \nIn addition, no decision maker receives credit for preventing a disaster that did not occur, and those \nwith vested interests may conspire to stop any such preventative action that is to their disadvantage \nbeing taken. Consider the armour-plating of airliner cockpit doors \u2013 would this expenditure have \nbeen implemented by the airlines pre-9\/11? All of this is overlaid by the tendency of organisations to \nmaintain the status quo and to act incrementally, when in fact step changes are required (Wright, van \nder Heijden, Bradfield, Burt, & Cairn, 2004). This is, of course, primarily a problem of failing to act \non the implications of a forecast, rather than a failure of forecasting, but these motivational factors \n 7 \nmay lead to an attitude of denial that the event in question may occur, so that its probability, from an \noperational perspective, is seriously underestimated.  \n \n \n2.3. Inappropriate attributions of causality \nOur ability to predict rare or unique events is relatively low when these focal events are caused by \ncomplex interactions between other, pre-cursor, events. Indeed, even actions subsequent to a forecast \nmay be part of such interactions. For example, a forecast of an election victory for a political party \nmay change voters\u201f behaviour so that the forecast turns out to be wrong. Chaos theory and the law of \nunintended consequences exemplify these problems. Taleb (2008) refers to \u201ethe three body problem\u201f \ndemonstrated by Poincare:.  \n\u201cIf you have only two planets in a solar-style system, with nothing else affecting their course then \nyou may be able to indefinitely predict the behaviour of these planets\u2026 but add a third body, say a \ncomet, ever so small between the planets... initially the third body will cause no drift but later its \neffects may become explosive... small differences in where this tiny planet is located \u2026\u201d (p. 176-177) \n \nThe further into the future we want to forecast, the greater will be the difficulty. The occurrence of \nfuture inventions, which will transform the way we live, may be the result of such chance \ninteractions over long periods. Such future inventions will be developed on the basis of future \nknowledge which, by definition, we cannot have at the present point in time. As Taleb points out: \n\u201cTo understand the future to the point of being able to predict it you need to incorporate elements \nfrom the future itself... assume you are a special scholar in a medieval university\u2019s forecasting \ndepartment\u2026 you would need to hit upon inventions of electricity, atomic bomb, internet, airplane\u2026 \nPrediction requires knowing about technologies that will be discovered in the future. But that very \n 8 \nknowledge will almost automatically allow us to start developing those technologies right away.  \nErgo, we do not know what we will know.\u201d (p 172 \u2013 173) \n \nIn short, Taleb argues that the accurate prediction of future, causal, chains of events is impossible. \nTo his mind, the sequence of causal impacts of one event upon another is not a simple linear \nsequence \u2013 for example like a stacked row of dominoes falling in one direction, with each domino\u201fs \nfall causing the next one in line to fall. By contrast, each observed event may have many causes and \nimpacts. We add to this viewpoint our view that only when a high consequence event has, in fact, \noccurred does the sequence of underpinning causes become salient, with hindsight. \n \nHumans have a tendency to invent causes for patterns in events that are best regarded as random. \nMany studies have demonstrated that humans have a strong tendency to see patterns within \nrandomness (Ayton, Hunt, & Wright, 1989), and they are also adept at finding reasons to explain \nthese patterns, even though these reasons may lack any evidential support (Fildes & Goodwin, \n2007a). For example, consider the prevalence of the fallacious belief amongst basketball players and \nfans that players\u201f attempts at scoring with a shot are more likely to succeed following a hit than \nfollowing a miss (Gilovich, Vallone, & Tversky, 1985). Also, of course, countering the propensity to \nsee patterns in randomness is the major purpose of using inferential statistics in the social sciences \n(Pollatsek & Konold, 1991). The search for causality thus seems to be a basic drive in human \ncognition, and it follows that confidence in our post-hoc constructions of causality may also \ngeneralise to (inappropriate) confidence in our predictions of the causal unfolding of future events. \nFor example, causes of the 9\/11 attack were analysed in detail by journalists using post-event \nhindsight, but the coverage of likely terrorist attacks within the US continent was mute, pre-event. \n \n \n 9 \n3. Problems with the scenario method and a proposed solution \nWe next assess the extent to which these three causes of low predictability can be mitigated by the \nscenario method. Given the difficulties in assessing probabilities for unique, unprecedented and rare \nevents, scenario planning, using the intuitive logics method, offers an approach for handling \nsituations of low predictability which avoids the requirement to make such estimates (van der \nHeijden, Bradfield, Burt, Cairns, & Wright, 2002).\n1\n The intuitive logic method has been extended \nand developed from its military origin to become a popular tool for policy planning. \n \nIn chronological order, the approach first requires that the scenario team members identify \npredetermined elements and critical uncertainties. These elements are then categorised under the \nSTEEP headings (social, technological, economic, ecological, and political), then \u201ecross-\ndisciplinary\u201f clusters are constructed between elements, such that causal impacts of one element on \nanother are identified by arrows of influence. In this way, causally-linked clusters of elements are \ngenerated and named that are, to a large degree, independent of one another.  The next step is to \nidentify those cluster headings whose content is both: (i) of high impact on the focal issue of concern \n(usually the viability of the host or focal organization), and (ii) of high uncertainty. The two cluster \nheadings that combine the greatest (a) impact, and (b) uncertainty over what that impact will be, are \nselected as the \u201escenario dimensions\u201f that are utilised to produce four detailed scenarios \u2013 developed \nwith a common, temporal, starting point, but ending in four diverse, yet plausible, causally-unfolded \nend-states. It is after this point that scenario development may focus on stakeholder analysis \u2013 what \nwould each of a set of stakeholders (e.g., competitors, regulators, customers, suppliers, etc) do as a \nparticular scenario unfolds in order to preserve or enhance their own interests?  This optional \ningredient of the scenario mix is perceived as adding a degree of realism to the scenarios.  The final \nstep is to evaluate the organization\u201fs strategies (previously kept separate and distinct) against each of \nthe scenarios.  Is a particular strategy robust against a range of scenarios, or is it fragile against \n 1\n0 \nsome?  This focus often leads to: (i) the re-design of strategic options, or, more fundamentally, (ii) \nthe re-design of the success formula of the organization. \n \nIt can be seen that the emphasis in scenario planning, as we have proposed it in this paper, is on \nuncovering the causal nature of the unfolding future. As Burt, Wright, Bradfield, Cairns, & van der \nHeijden, (2006) note, scenarios are not predictions, extrapolations, good or bad futures, or science \nfiction. Instead, they are purposeful stories about how the contextual environment could unfold over \ntime, and these stories consist of the following: \n \n1 A description of a future end state in a horizon year \u2013 That is, the combinations of \nuncertainties and their emergent resolution at the final point in time in a particular scenario \nstory. As we shall argue later, the conventional intuitive logics methodology is limited in the \ndegree to which a broad range of uncertainty is addressed. \n2 An interpretation of current events and their propagation into the future \u2013 The scenario \nmethodology is designed to help participants make sense of yesterday\u201fs events and the causal \nimpact that they are having into the future. In addition, some of yesterday\u201fs events may not yet \nhave been fully manifested as outcomes, and their full manifestation may be carried forward in \ntime toward the horizon year of a particular scenario \n3 An internally consistent account of how a future world unfolds \u2013 That is, an explanation based \non causal logic of how a particular scenario unfolds from the past to the present to the future. \nThe story will represent the dynamic interplay of predetermined elements and resolved \nuncertainties, showing how these factors interconnect and impact each other, and revealing \ntheir logical consequences. \n \n \n 1\n1 \nNote that, in general, the two clusters that result from the application of the intuitive logic approach \nto scenario construction will each contain a mix of pre-determined elements and what are perceived \nas critical uncertainties that are causally linked together. Generally, four scenarios are constructed \nthat are derived from the resolution of events within each cluster into two major outcomes \u2013 \nwith each of the outcomes of the first cluster then being combined with each of the outcomes of the \nsecond cluster (see van der Heijden et al, 2002, chapter 7, for more details). Thus, the resolution of \nthe contents of the two high-impact, high-uncertainty, clusters drives the development of the \nstorylines of the four resultant scenarios. The development of the four storylines will, in practice, \nalso utilise other uncertainties and pre-determined elements that have been generated by scenario \nworkshop participantsbut which are seen by these participants to have less impact on the focal issue \nof concern. It follows that each of the four resultant scenarios will be separable from the other three, \nand also more extreme than the other three in some ways. Since each scenario represents an \nintersection of resolved uncertainties, each detailed scenario will, logically, have an infinitesimal \nlikelihood of actual occurrence. It also follows that the interactions of resolved uncertainties that are \nidentified by participants but which are not part of the two high-impact clusters may have led to the \ndevelopment of quite different scenarios, if they were instead taken as the focal uncertainties that \ndrive the construction of the scenarios \u2013 c.f. Taleb's three-body problem that we described earlier. In \nshort, the step-by-step components of the intuitive logic method of scenario construction may restrict \nthe diversity of the constructed scenarios. We return to this issue in the final section of our paper, \nwhen we propose new approaches to coping with low predictability. \n \nScenario planning is thus designed to be an organizationally based social-reasoning process which \nutilises dialogue and conversation to share participants\u201f perceptions of the environment and to \nfacilitate participants\u201f interactions as they engage in a process of sense-making through theory \nbuilding and storytelling. The process of building scenarios should serve to bring latent issues to the \n 1\n2 \nsurface, so that it is more difficult to deny the prospect of high-impact events when there is objective \ninformation available that they are liable to occur. This is particularly likely to be the case where \noutside participants or independent facilitators are involved in the process. Thus, scenario planning \nmay help to reduce some of the motivational biases that were outlined earlier. \n \nGregory and Duran (2001) and Healey and Hodgkinson (2008) reviewed some problematic issues \nwith scenario planning. Included in these is the issue that having individuals, or groups of \nindividuals, imagining the occurrence of a sequence of events makes the focal sequence appear more \nlikely to occur than the normative probability computed for the intersection of these individually-\nevaluated events would imply. Tversky and Kahneman labelled this as a bias due to the operation of \nthe \u201csimulation heuristic\u201d. Specifically, if the events\u201f occurrences are linked in a causal chain (where \none event causes the occurrence of the next), the intersection will be viewed as having an increased \nlikelihood. As such, the act of constructing scenarios may, by itself, produce increased, but \ninappropriate, confidence in one\u201fs ability to anticipate the future (Kuhn & Sniezek, 1996). Thus, \nwhile the focus on causal chains in scenario planning is a strength, because a knowledge of the \ncausal interactions of events, in principle, allows the decision maker to go beyond the use of \nextrapolation based on historical data in the reference class, it can also be a weakness. The use of \nmultiple scenarios that provide plausible, but different, chains of causality thus provides one \npotential way to alleviate such overconfidence in the unfolding of a single, focal, scenario. \n \nHowever, Healey and Hodgkinson noted that the increased plausibility of focal scenarios may \nexacerbate another problematic issue: if the components of a scenario are derived from the current \nmental models of the decision makers, then these mental models will be strengthened by the \noperation of the simulation heuristic. As O\u201fBrien (2004) argued, in practice, scenario participants \ntend to regularly emphasise economic factors \u2013 such as exchange rates, interest rates, and the focal \n 1\n3 \ncountry\u201fs economic activity \u2013 as uncertainties that are subsequently given prominence in the \nscenarios that participants constructed. Also, recent and current media-emphasised concerns (e.g. of \nterrorism activities) tend also to replicate themselves in constructed scenarios through the  operation \nof the availability bias. O\u201fBrien labelled these practice-recognised issues as \u201cfuture myopia\u201d. By \ncontrast, as Wright, Cairns, and Goodwin, (forthcoming) note, one way, which is used in practice by \nscenario practitioners, is to challenge the decision makers\u201f mental models by the introduction of \nwhat the scenario community term \u201cremarkable people\u201d into the strategic conversation \u2013 i.e., \nincluding as participants in a scenario exercise individuals (often from outside the host organization) \nwho hold disparate and contradictory views on key uncertainties.  Scenario planning practitioners \nargue that between-workshop activity spent on researching the nature of critical uncertainties \nidentified in earlier workshops will also add to the quality of a strategic conversation about the \nnature of the future, but there is no empirical evidence on the benefit of such desk-based research.  \n \nIn summary, while the application of the scenario method may reduce any tendency to deny the \nprospect of undesirable events because of its explicit nature, it may reinforce existing framings of the \nfuture unless the addition of the views of \u201cremarkable people\u201d can counter these viewpoints. The \ncreation of detailed scenarios \u2013 containing particular causal chains of events \u2013 may also serve to \nincrease the perceived likelihood that a specific scenario will, in fact, occur. Also, the method may \ncause participants to discount the possibility of high impact events which are not reached via these \ncausal chains. Crisis management has been proposed as one method to deal with unexpected events, \nand we next to summarise this method and evaluate whether there are any insights within this \napproach that can usefully be applied to the development of the scenario method, in order to \nameliorate the weaknesses that we have identified and discussed. \n \n3.1. Crisis management \n 1\n4 \nPearson and Clair (1998) reviewed organizational crisis management, defined as \u201c\u2026 low \nprobability, high-impact events that threaten the viability of the organization and are characterized \nby ambiguity of cause, effect, and means of resolution\u2026\u201d (p. 60). The authors list an array of such \ncrises, including environmental spill, computer tampering, malicious rumour, a natural disaster that \ndisrupts a major product or service, terrorist attack, and plant explosion. The fundamental aims of \ncrisis management are to sustain \u2013 or resume \u2013 operational activity, minimise losses, and learn \nlessons for the future. As such, crisis management is focussed on management rather than prediction, \nalthough the literature does discuss the failure to heed warning signals of impending crises, and links \nsuch failures to limitations of perception and cognitive limitations. Perrow (1984) was one of the \nfirst to warn of the risks inherent in high technologies that are characterized by \u201cinteractive \ncomplexity\u201d and \u201c tight coupling\u201d, arguing that \u201c\u2026multiple and unexpected interactions of failures \nare inevitable\u201d(p. 6). \n \nPearson, Clair, Hisra, and Mitroff (1997) noted that many organizations prepare for the crisis that \nthey believe to be the most probable or expect to have the most impact if it occurs. These authors \nargue that, instead, \u201c\u2026 the best-prepared organizations compile a crisis portfolio for an assortment \nof crises that would demand different responses\u2026 this may seem a wasteful approach but\u2026 the \nmost dangerous crises\u2026 cause greater trouble, specifically because no-one was thinking about or \npreparing for them\u201d (p. 55). Pollard and Hotho (2006) argued that scenario planning (see the \nprevious section) can be combined with crisis management to identify \u201ccrisis futures\u201d, but, as we \nhave seen, scenario planning has inherent problems in achieving this goal. \n \nIn summary, crisis management delineates inappropriate framing as a focus of attention, but it is \nunclear as to how inappropriate frames are identified. The explicit focus of the method on \nundesirable events should reduce any tendency to deny the prospect of these occurring. The general \n 1\n5 \nfocus of the approach is on the management of crisis outcomes rather than on the prediction of \nparticular crises. However, the cost-benefit trade-off of preparing an organization for all possible \ncrises is not addressed in the extant literature. Nor has a systematic approach been offered to enable \nmanagers to rank-order crises for differential attention. Nevertheless, the focus of crisis management \non preparing the organization for a wide range of extreme events is in stark contrast to the intuitive \nlogics scenario method where, as we have discussed, the range of focal scenarios is likely to be \nconstrained by components of the construction methodology. \n \n \n4. Coping with unpredictability: enhancing the scenario method \nIn decision making and planning, of particular concern are possible high impact events that are \nimplicitly assigned a probability of zero, or, at most, an extremely low probability. From our \nanalysis of the limitations and weaknesses of the scenario method, any method that is likely to \nimprove predictability, or allow for effective planning when it cannot be improved, will have the \nfollowing characteristics. \n \n1. Predictions must not by restricted by data in the reference class. They should also offer the \npotential to generate surprises.  \n2. There is a need for the method to challenge existing mental frames \n3. Cognitive biases in the estimation of probabilities must be avoided \n4. The method needs to surface possibilities which there may be a motivation to ignore, so that they \ncan be explicitly addressed. \n5. Overconfidence in a single future scenario, or in a narrow \u201erange\u201f of such scenarios, should be \navoided. \n6. The method should exploit certainties or near certainties about the nature of the future. \n 1\n6 \n7. The method should help decision makers to assess uncertainty by distinguishing what we know \nfrom what we don\u201ft know.  \n8. The method should identify the uncertainties which have the greatest potential impact. \n \nAs we have seen, scenario planning, when applied correctly, meets criteria (1), (3), (4) and (6), but it \ncan fail on (2) and (5). Scenario planning tries to achieve (7) by identifying the boundaries of \nuncertainty (the \u201eknown unknowns\u201f), but, as we have argued, the diversity of scenarios can be too \nrestrictive. For example, the range of scenarios may contain GDP growth figures for an economy \nranging from \u20131% to 4%, but how secure can decision makers be that this represents the complete \nrange of possibilities? The same consideration applies to the qualitative elements of scenarios. One \nof the authors has run regular scenario planning exercises with employees of a major company in the \nUK defence sector. Sometimes participants propose the development of scenarios which contain \nevents such as impending meteor collisions with Earth or even threats of invasions by extra-\nterrestrials. How do we deem whether such events should lie within or outside the range of \nplausibility? As we have seen, scenario planning is concerned with the identification of causality \nand, as such, events without causes linked to events in the present are not part of the content, or \noutcome, of the intuitive logics scenario process. Therefore events which cannot be reached from the \npresent through these linkages, such as large meteor collisions with Earth, would not be valid \nscenario components, and hence these sources of uncertainty would not be addressed through \nscenario planning. Scenario planning explicitly addresses point (8), above, by identifying cluster \nheadings whose causally-related content has a high impact on the focal issue of concern. However, \nthis is usually specified at a higher level (e.g. the viability of the host or focal organization), so that \nthat impact on the specific objectives may not be addressed. In the following sections, we suggest \nhow the approach could be improved so that it meets all of the above requirements. \n \n 1\n7 \n4.1. Challenging framing and the perceived boundaries of uncertainty \nIn scenario planning, the employment of \u201eremarkable people\u201f and the accommodation of minorities \nwith apparently heretical views about the future is likely to reduce frame blindness in the context of \na facilitated process intervention within an organization. However, at present, the incorporation of \nsuch potential insights is unstructured and unevaluated. The inclusion of devil\u201fs advocacy and \ndialectical inquiry techniques as ways of challenging team-based opinions has, however, been \nstudied quite extensively, but from the perspective of the perceived value added to the decision \nprocess, rather than the resultant validity of any forecasts underpinning decision making. However, \nthere is no reason why scenario planning should not include formal methods to challenge existing \nframes. In decision making, techniques like the \u201cframe analysis worksheet\u201d (Russo & Schoemaker, \n1989) have been designed to serve this purpose. In scenario planning such a worksheet could ask \ndecision makers to assess their scenarios by asking them to respond explicitly to questions like: \n- What boundaries have we put on the scenarios? What aspects have we left out of consideration? \n- Why do we think about this question in the way we do? \n- What do the scenarios emphasize? \n- What do they minimize? \n- Do our competitors or our consumers think about these issues differently from the way we do? \n \n4.2. Constructing scenarios using backward logic \nAn alternative to providing challenges to already-constructed scenarios using the frame analysis \nworksheet is to formally build challenges to frames and boundaries into the scenario planning \nprocess. This could be achieved by a employing a fundamentally different method to derive \nscenarios. Rather than moving forward through causal chains to arrive at scenarios, as in \nconventional, intuitive logics and scenario planning, an alternative is to work backwards from \nobjectives. An analogy can be drawn between event trees, which use forward logic, and fault trees, \n 1\n8 \nwhich use backward logic. The latter start with a top event (e.g. the failure of a system) and then \nidentify the \u201eunderlying events\u201f (e.g. failure of a component) that need to occur in order for the top \nevent to be realised. The combined use of both event trees and fault trees has been found to enhance \nreliability analysis (Pat\u00e9-Cornell, 1984). \n \n An organization\u201fs over-riding objectives can be identified using techniques like objectives \nhierarchies and value-focussed thinking (c.f. Keeney, 1992; Wright & Goodwin, 1999), and the \nworst and best possible levels of achievement of these objectives can be estimated. Such assessments \ncan be made quantitatively (as in the case of profit or returns on investments) or qualitatively (as in \nthe case of a company image). Next, it should be possible to list the factors that drive the extent to \nwhich these objectives are achieved (e.g. profit may be driven by factors like sales volume and raw \nmaterial prices, while the company image might be driven by factors like industrial relations). Third, \nthe ranges of possible achievement (worst possible and best possible case) for each of these \nobjectives should then be extended beyond the ranges already put forward (i.e., made more extreme), \nand planners should be asked whether they can envisage circumstances where the behaviour and \ninteraction of the drivers could make these more extreme best- and worst-case levels of achievement \nplausible. If appropriate, they should be encouraged to envisage whether additional drivers may exist \nwhich could account for these more extreme levels of achievement. If such levels are thought to be \nimplausible, the process should stop and the scenario workshop participants should be encouraged to \nwrite out explicit reasons why this is the case. Conversely, if plausibility is established, the ranges \nshould be further extended and the process repeated until implausibility is obtained. Once the ranges \nof plausibility have been established for the objectives, it should be possible to work backwards to \nidentify the drivers or interactions of drivers which are having the greatest impact on these ranges. \nFor example, uncertainty in government regulatory measures may be judged to be having the biggest \nimpact on the range of possible market shares that a company will achieve in five years\u201f time. \n 1\n9 \nAlternatively, the interaction of regulation and the number of new entrants to the industry may be the \nmain contributor to uncertainty. These drivers, or combinations of drivers, can be ranked in terms of \ntheir impact in a manner that is analogous to tornado diagrams in risk analysis. \n \nThis backward logic approach has the advantage of focusing participants\u201f attention on the possibility \nof extreme impacts on an organization\u201fs objectives. As we argued earlier, forward causal reasoning \nmay fail to identify these possible impacts because of (i) the huge potential range of causal chains, \nonly a few of which may be simulated in the scenarios, and (ii) the absence of a focus on objectives \nin the scenario construction process.  \n \nOne problem with fault trees, and hence with this analogous approach using backward logic, is the \ndifficulty that people have in identifying a full range of drivers for the top event, a tendency that \nFischhoff, Slovic, and Lichtenstein (1978) have referred to as the \u201eout-of-sight-out-of-mind\u201f \nphenomenon. The encouragement to consider the possibility of additional drivers (see above) may be \nhelpful here, but some research suggests that an effective technique is to ask scenario workshop \nparticipants to assume that the top level event has already occurred (e.g., in this case, a return on an \ninvestment 10% below that originally thought to be possible), and then to ask them to imagine what \ncaused it. This shift in perspective from the future to the past was found to generate more causes for \nthe top event in a study by Mitchell, Russo, and Pennington (1989). \n \n4.3. Understanding human motivation by emphasising stakeholder analysis within scenario planning \nOur proposed backward-logic approach to scenario construction will enable the generation of \nscenarios that permutate the focal organization\u201fs achievement of extremes in its over-riding \nobjectives. The next step is to \u201cflesh-out\u201d the scenario storylines by developing and evaluating the \ncausal linkages in the skeleton scenarios. Given the human pre-disposition to impose patterns on \n 2\n0 \nrandom sequences of events, as discussed earlier, what principles should guide the construction of \ncausality? One of the (almost) certainties that will apply to the future is that human motivation and \nself interest will be a key causal factor in determining the characteristics of the future. Maslow\u201fs \n\u201ctheory of human motivation\u201d (Maslow, 1943) was a goal-based conceptualisation. Maslow argued \nthat the basic needs of humans are physiologically-based \u2013 the need for food, water, sleep and sex. If \nthe physiological needs are \u201crelatively well satiated\u201d, then physical safety needs become the focus of \nattention. If both physiological and safety needs are relatively well satisfied, then the need for love, \naffection and belongingness become a focus. The next set of needs in Maslow\u201fs hierarchy is the need \nfor esteem from others. The ultimate need is that of self-actualisation \u2013 the desire for self-fulfilment \nand the desire to know and understand. \n \nFrom this short summary of Maslow\u201fs theory, we can see that Taleb\u201fs medieval scholar, described \nearlier, has a basis for anticipating the nature of the future: humankind will strive to satisfy the \nhierarchy of needs. Thus, the invention and development of electricity supplies aid the satisfaction of \nphysiological and safety needs \u2013 e.g., a warm and light home. The invention and development of \nmass immunization aids the satisfaction of safety needs. The invention and development of the \ninternet aids the satisfaction of the need for self-actualisation \u2013 e.g., instant access to knowledge. \nThe invention and development of the aeroplane allows, for example, contact with family and \nbusiness colleagues \u2013 thus, in part, satisfying the love, affection and belongingness needs. \n \nIt follows, therefore, that specific technological developments cannot be predicted, but general \ntechnological development can \u2013 since any development will be to satisfy human needs. For \nexample, suppose that the effect of an unknown event is the end of international air travel. How \nwould self-interested humans react? Managers still need to hold face-to-face meetings with overseas \ncolleagues, and we could also expect enterprising people to respond to this new situation. The result \n 2\n1 \nwould be likely to be a huge growth in the use of video conferencing, and an associated \nenhancement of the availability and quality of such services. In short, basic human motivations can \nbe modelled and analysed in an enhanced scenario planning methodology. We discuss an outline \nlogic and procedure for such an enhancement in the following paragraphs. \n \nAs outlined earlier, the scenario approach, as practised, is based on the premise that stakeholder \nvalues and actions, once surfaced, add realism to already-constructed scenarios. However, accepting \nMaslow\u201fs theory of human motivation, it follows that understanding stakeholder motivations can \nprovide primary insights into the nature of an unfolding future. As a first step, stakeholder groupings \nneed to be identified and differentiated. In a comprehensive review, Bryson (2004) presented fifteen \nstakeholder identification and analysis techniques. The basic techniques focus on: (i) brainstorming a \nlist of potential stakeholders, (ii) listing criteria for how each of these groupings would view the \n(focal) organization\u201fs performance, and (iii) analysing what can be done by the focal organization to \nsatisfy each stakeholder.  \n \nAs we have seen, the scenario method explores the complex relationship between social, economic, \ntechnological, environmental and political factors from multiple perspectives, enables sense making \nof their interactions, and provides a vehicle for the development of plausible futures. The \nincorporation of an enhanced stakeholder analysis enables this exploration to be structured to take \ninto account the input of and impact upon all involved and affected parties. In the context of the \norganizational scenario workshop, an emphasis on stakeholder analysis assumes that scenario \nparticipants will be able to put themselves in the shoes of each particular stakeholder grouping when \nthis does not involve actual interactions with representatives of such groupings. At the same time, \nstakeholder interests and values may be more subtle than those that are obvious on the surface. \nHowever, there is evidence that role-playing unfamiliar roles can lead to insights. Green (2002) \n 2\n2 \nshowed that when university students were first asked to role-play the participants in six \nheterogeneous conflict situations, their group-based resolutions of the conflict \u2013 or the group-based \nforecasts of the outcomes of these conflicts \u2013 were accurate. Intuitively, it would seem that one\u201fs \nown experiences of the past resolution of conflicts \u2013 perhaps as recalled or previously experienced, \nand including both personal and non-personal conflicts \u2013 offer a strong guide to the \nprediction\/resolution of the outcomes of novel conflicts. In other words, if the resolutions of \nconflicts are, generally, the result of the operation of basic human motivations and value systems, \nthen the conditions for reasoning by analogy are favourable (Wright, 2002). \n \n4.4. Augmentation \nAs we pointed out earlier, events which cannot be reached from the present via causal chains will not  \nconstitute valid components of scenarios. This means that the range of uncertainty embraced by the \nscenarios may not include surprise events for which the causality was not apparent, like natural \ndisasters, the effects of malicious rumours or accidents causing major pollution. Attempts to \nincorporate such events into scenarios would be likely to imperil the cohesiveness of the scenario \ndevelopment process, and we therefore suggest that they should be addressed outside this process by \na process of augmentation (Makridakis, Hogarth, & Gaba, 2009). Processes akin to those used in \ncrisis management can be used to draw up a portfolio of potential events (both benevolent and \nmalevolent) that may impact on the organisation. Techniques like brainstorming may be particularly \neffective in generating lists of such events, which can subsequently be filtered on the basis of their \nperceived likelihood and impact. An alternative is the \u201cred team\/blue team\u201d method (e.g. see Carter, \n2001), where one team play the role of an adversary trying to damage an organisation as much a \npossible, though the outcomes of this process are likely to be confined to malevolent, human-\ngenerated events like sabotage. Employing specialists from different areas to identify risks and \nopportunities relating to their specialism may also be productive. \n 2\n3 \n \nOne issue that remains unresolved, however, is the one that we identified previously in our \ndiscussion of crisis management. There, the extant advice is that the organization should compile a \nportfolio of crises that demand a wide range of responses. However, the cost-benefit trade-off of \ncreating such organizational preparedness was not addressed in the literature.  The same dilemma \narises in our proposed augmentation of the scenario method. Should all possible scenarios be \naddressed by the focal organization? We posit that such preparedness for all possible scenarios is \nunrealisable. For this reason, we propose that the focal organization should create flexibility, \ndiversification and insurability in its response to the particular scenarios constructed by our \nadvocated methods of backward logic and augmentation. \n \n4.5. Evaluating flexibility, diversification, and insurability in option-against-scenario evaluations \nThinking about the future in as general terms as possible should reduce the dangers that people will \nsuffer from the simulation heuristic and become overconfident in relation to particular scenarios. \nThus, a scenario may refer to technological innovation in car engine efficiency, rather than, for \nexample, the invention of a hydrogen-powered car engine. We can then make an allowance, within \nour planning, for the occurrence of a specific event within a general category, e.g., one that impacts \n\u2013 either negatively or positively \u2013 on the over-riding objectives of the focal organization. The \ndesirability of characterizing the future in general terms suggests that the organisations that will best \ncope with poorly predictable future events will be those that are flexible and diverse. Firms should \nnot operate in the airline business or the video conferencing business, but should instead operate in \nthe face-to-face communication business. Firms should not operate in the electricity business, but \nshould instead operate in the energy business. As such, these general-purpose organisations will be \nless susceptible to negatively-valenced events that disrupt particular technologies, and will be \nreceptive to positively-valenced events that provide unexpected opportunities. Thus options to \n 2\n4 \nupscale, or downscale, a particular activity should also be held open (cf Miller & Waller, 2003). \nAdditionally, insurance could be sought to downside risks.  \n \nFrom this discussion, our prescription for decision making and planning in the face of low levels of \npredictability is straightforward. The decision maker should be alert to the degree to which a \nstrategic option is: (i) flexible \u2013 i.e., the investment can be up-scaled or down-scaled at any point in \nthe future; (ii) diversified \u2013 i.e., following the option that diversifies the firm\u201fs current major \noffering(s) by providing a different technology base, a different production base, or a different \ncustomer base; and (iii) insurable \u2013 i.e., allows the possibility of insuring against extreme down-side \nrisk. Our prescription can be implemented as a necessary check-list that must be completed in any \noption evaluation or as part of a more formalised, multi-attribute, evaluation of options against \nscenarios (c.f. Goodwin & Wright, 2001). \n \n4.6. A short demonstration of our enhancement of the intuitive logics scenario method \nImagine that a London-based, black-cab, taxi firm is interested in understanding future demand for \nits services in a particular part of London. One of its over-riding objectives is high short-term profit. \nProfit is driven by revenue, which is driven by the demand for taxi journeys. Apart from weather \nconditions and other seasonal effects, the owners of the firm believe that demand is influenced by \nthe efficiency of alternative modes of transportation \u2013 including subway trains and over-land buses. \nImagine that the firm\u201fs owners are particularly concerned with the speed of the subway trains on \nparticular routes, reasoning that the faster or slower the journey times, the smaller or greater the \ndemand for taxi services. One way forward is for the firm to measure average journey times for \nparticular journeys over days and months, and compute averages and measures of dispersion. \nAssume that measurements exhibit a normal distribution and remain fairly constant over the months. \nWhat are the plausible worst and best outcomes for profitability for the taxi firm over the next few \n 2\n5 \nyears? What would cause a dramatic, but still plausible, weakening in demand? What would cause a \ndramatic, but still plausible, strengthening in demand? Focusing on the speed of the subway trains, \nwe can intuitively see that a reduction in a particular journey time from 30 minutes to less than 20 \nminutes is implausible \u2013 assuming that new technology investments will not be made by London \nTransport in the next few years. By contrast, it is easy to see that a substantial lengthening of journey \ntimes is plausible, for example, if bag searches of passengers are introduced in response to further \nterrorist activity in London. What could cause an increase in terrorist activity in London? Questions \nsuch as this, when focussed on the motivations and capabilities of stakeholder groupings (including \nterrorists, passengers, and the London authorities), will reveal each grouping\u201fs likely reaction to both \n(i) changes in the contextual environment, and (ii) the self-interested actions of each stakeholder \ngrouping as the events within a particular scenario start to unfold. After a range of plausible \nscenarios have been constructed, the next step would be for the taxi firm to evaluate its strategic \noptions \u2013 for example, its ability to quickly up-scale its service provision within the particular \nscenario that we have just outlined.  \n \n5. Conclusion \nLow predictability is a concern where we have difficulties in estimating reliable probabilities for \nhigh impact events and\/or where we are unable to measure the reliability of these probabilities. \nScenario planning attempts to avoid these problems by not requiring estimates of probabilities. We \nhave assessed the ability of the scenario method to deal with the problem of low predictability. In \nevaluating the effectiveness of this technique in dealing with three factors that lead to low \npredictability \u2013 inappropriate framing, cognitive and motivational biases, and inappropriate \nattributions of causality \u2013 we identified some serious deficiencies of the method. In the light of these, \nwe have made four proposals that should help to improve the effectiveness of scenario planning \nwhen organizations wish to formulate plans to cope with conditions of low predictability. These \n 2\n6 \ninvolve (i) providing conditions for challenging mental frames by creating objectives-focussed \nscenarios using backward-logic; (ii) understanding human motivations and emphasising their \nimplications within scenarios; (iii) enhancing scenario planning though adopting the approach of \ncrisis management in order to augment analysis of uncertainty; and (iv) evaluating strategic options \nagainst constructed scenarios in terms of flexibility, diversification, and insurability. \n \nIn these ways, the essence of scenario planning \u2013 based on understanding the causality of events \u2013 is \npreserved and augmented by a mix of backward logic and crisis management approaches to aid in \nthe construction of an extended and more extreme range of scenarios. Currently, as we have \ndiscussed, conventional scenario planning, using the intuitive logics method, is restricted, in that the \nrange of potential scenarios is constrained by limited choice of available scenario dimensions. If \nscenario planning is to be enhanced to deal with low levels of predictability, then, as we have \nargued, developments in the application of the scenario method are both necessary and desirable. \n \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \nArmstrong, J.
