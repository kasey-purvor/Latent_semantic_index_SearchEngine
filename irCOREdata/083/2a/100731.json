It is shown that biaxial tensile strain reduces the sheet resistance of\nhighly doped n-type layers created by Sb or As implantation. The improvement is stronger with Sb,\nleading to a reversal in the relative doping efficiency of these n-type impurities. For Sb, the primary\neffect is a strong enhancement of activation as a function of tensile strain. At low processing\ntemperatures, 0.7% strain more than doubles Sb activation, while enabling the formation of stable,\n\u000310-nm-deep junctions. This makes Sb an interesting alternative to As for ultrashallow junctions in\nstrain-engineered complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor devices. \u00a9 2006 American Institute\nof Physics. \u0004DOI: 10.1063\/1.2382741\u0005\nStrain engineering has become an essential approach to\nmeet performance requirements of metal-oxide-semi-\nconductor devices on Si.1 While the role of strain in channel\nmobility enhancement is well recognized,2 little is known\nabout its effects on the behavior of dopant atoms, such as\nthose in ultrashallow source\/drain extensions. Scaling re-\nquirements for ultrashallow junctions include reducing junc-\ntion depth and increasing junction steepness, while keeping\nsheet resistance\u2014inversely related to carrier mobility, activa-\ntion, and junction depth\u2014low despite the narrower current\npath allowed by the scaled junction.1\nArsenic is the favored n-type dopant species for\nn-channel source\/drain doping in conventional Si. Experi-\nmental literature discussing As implants in bulk and strained\nSi layers has shown sheet resistance to be reduced under\ntensile strain. This was reported to be a result of mobility\nenhancement, with no evidence to date for any improvement\nin activation.3,4 On the other hand, theoretical calculations by\nSadigh et al. have suggested that biaxial tensile strain should\nhave large effects on the solubility of dopant atoms, and that\nsolid solubility limits can be increased by several orders of\nmagnitude for large n-type species implanted into tensile\nstrained silicon, a combined result of dopant size mismatch\nand strain effects on the Fermi level.5 Although there have\nbeen a number of experimental attempts to test this predic-\ntion in recent years, none has so far shown a significant\npositive result.\nDue to its greater nuclear stopping power and lower\nrange straggle, Sb is favorable compared to As with respect\nto its as-implanted \u201cmetallurgical\u201d junction depth and junc-\ntion abruptness. Previously we have shown that implanted Sb\ncan be highly activated in conventional unstrained Si follow-\ning low-temperature thermal processing, with very little out\ndiffusion for temperatures \u0001800 \u00b0C.6,7 If strain does indeed\nimprove Sb solid solubility,5 it is in strain-engineered devices\nthat Sb may be best utilized. Coupled with this is the pro-\ncessing benefit that Sb diffusion is retarded in the presence of\ntensile strain,8 whereas As diffusion appears to be increased.9\nIn this letter we report on experiments that replicate\u2014in\none dimension\u2014the proposed formation of Sb source\/drain\nextension regions in biaxial tensile strained silicon. Our\nstudy compared IQE Silicon Compounds wafers with\n17.5 nm strained Si layers, grown on Si0.83Ge0.17 relaxed\nbuffer layers, with conventional p-type Si control wafers.\nDefect-free growth on relaxed buffer layers with 17% Ge\ncontent will create a strain level of 0.7% in the strained Si\nlayer, and micro-Raman spectroscopy measurements con-\nfirmed that the layers were indeed strained to this level.\nBoth the strained and unstrained wafers underwent the\nsame processing sequence, as follows. Each wafer was im-\nplanted with low energy \u00012 keV\u0002 Sb or As to a dose of 3.5\n\u00021014 cm\u22122, creating as-implanted junctions at 12 or 14 nm,\nrespectively, as defined at the 3\u00021018 cm\u22123 level. Implant\ndoses were confirmed by Rutherford backscattering spectros-\ncopy and secondary-ion-mass spectrometry \u0001SIMS\u0002, and\njunction depths were determined by SIMS. The SIMS mea-\nsurements were performed using a 500 eV Cs+ analyzing\nbeam, giving a sputter-limited depth resolution of\n\u00032 nm\/decade, essential to resolve the details of the ul-\ntrashallow Sb profiles generated in this work.\nAfter implantation the wafers were cut into pieces and\nactivated using a 10 s isochronal annealing cycle in the range\nof 600\u2013800 \u00b0C. Subsequently, samples were examined using\nfurther high-resolution SIMS and van der Pauw sheet resis-\ntance measurements combined with Hall-effect measure-\nments to measure active carrier density and Hall mobility\nthroughout the implanted region.10\nThe measured van der Pauw sheet resistance \u0001Rs\u0002 of the\nn-type layers is shown in Fig. 1 as a function of annealing\ntemperature. Sb implants into conventional Si show similar\nresistance characteristics to those found by Alzanki et al.6\nwhere the lowest Rs is seen for processing at 600 and\n700 \u00b0C, and Rs increases as the anneal temperature is raised\nto 800 \u00b0C and above.

Just as in conventional Si, the\nbest Rs value is found at low processing temperatures, here,\n700 \u00b0C. However, in contrast to conventional Si, Rs remains\nstable as the anneal temperature is raised to 800\u00b0 C, an im-\nportant practical advantage for industrial processing.\nFigure 1\u0001b\u0002 compares results obtained for Sb and As im-\nplants under the same processing conditions. The reader can\nsee that for these low anneal temperatures Sb produces more\nhighly conducting layers, even though the Sb junctions are\nexpected to be shallower than the As ones. The shallower\njunctions for Sb are a result of \u0001a\u0002 the shallower Sb-\nimplanted distribution and \u0001b\u0002 the absence of transient en-\nhanced diffusion \u0001TED\u0002, which is an important feature in the\ncase of As. For processing at 800 \u00b0C the Rs for As implants\ntends to improve towards the Sb case. At this temperature,\nhowever, Dilliway et al. have shown that As exhibits very\nsignificant strain-enhanced TED and other diffusion effects.4\nThis led to a junction depth \u000380% deeper than that reported\nfor Sb in the present letter. It is also noteworthy that the\nresults in Ref. 4 \u0004presented for comparison in Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002\u0005 show\nonly a 15% Rs improvement between the strained and un-\nstrained cases for 3 keV, 4\u00021014 cm\u22122 As implants into\nstrained Si on a Si0.8Ge0.2 strain-relaxed buffer.\nFigure 2\u0001a\u0002 illustrates the areal density \u0001or \u201cdose\u201d\u0002 of\nactive carriers \u0001Ns\u0002 measured by the Hall-effect technique.\nFor Sb implants in bulk Si, the best levels of activation are\nseen after processing at 600 and 700 \u00b0C, in agreement with\nprevious findings.6,7 Comparing Sb implants in bulk Si with\nthose in the strained case, the figure demonstrates that the\nstrain has more than doubled the amount of electrically ac-\ntive Sb. At 600 and 700 \u00b0C, activation is improved from\n30% to 60%. Likewise in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002, it can be seen that for\nidentical implants in the strained material, Sb is more highly\nactivated than As for low-temperature processing.\nThis is the first time that a reduction in Rs in tensile\nstrained Si has been shown to be a result of an enhancement\nin electrical activation. Previous work on As has suggested\nthat activation is unchanged.3,4 Modest reductions in Rs were\nreported, but the available data indicated that these were only\na result of increased mobility.3,4 Although the carrier density\nis subject to a currently unknown correction factor due to\nscattering mechanisms inherent in the Hall-effect\nmeasurement,11 it seems unlikely that this will discount the\nactivation effect. Evaluating the literature, the reduction in Rs\nwhich we have demonstrated seems much too large to be a\nresult of mobility enhancement.12\nHaving shown the benefits of Sb in terms of overall elec-\ntrical activation, we now turn to a comparison of the chemi-\ncal and electrical profiles of Sb in both strained and un-\nstrained Si. In Fig. 3, the dotted curve and the curves with\nopen symbols show SIMS profiles of Sb after implantation,\nand after annealing for 10 s at 700 \u00b0C\u2014the condition which\ngave the best value of Rs. The data show that the junction\ndepth of 12 nm is not significantly increased by this anneal.\nThis is consistent with previous observations of the anneal-\ning of implanted Sb in unstrained Si, where no movement\nwas found in the tail of the Sb profile.7 In the peak region of\nthe Sb profile, some movement does occur, consistent with\nredistribution of Sb towards the surface and a modest degree\nof pileup at or near the Si\/SiO2 interface \u0001located at \u00032 nm\nnominal depth in Fig. 3\u0002. This behavior is apparent in both\nthe strained and unstrained Si, although the pileup is margin-\nally reduced in the strained case. A similar redistribution be-\nhavior, in unstrained Si, has been observed by Sealy et al.\nusing medium-energy ion scattering measurements.13\nFigure 3 also shows the corresponding electrical profiles\nin strained and unstrained Si after annealing. Active carrier\nconcentration \u0001filled symbols\u0002 and mobility \u0001half-filled sym-\nbols\u0002 were both measured by the differential Hall\ntechnique.10 Results shown are corrected for surface\ndepletion,14 enabling the Sb electrical and atomic profiles to\nbe properly matched with respect to depth.

The electrically active profile of Sb in strained\nSi reaches a peak level of \u00031021 cm\u22123, comparable to the\npeak atomic concentration measured by SIMS. On the other\nhand, the electrical profile for Sb in unstrained Si reaches a\nmuch lower peak level of \u00033\u00021020 cm\u22123, implying that a\nsubstantial proportion of the Sb in the peak region is electri-\ncally inactive\u2014presumably in the form of clusters or\nprecipitates.\nCurrently little work has been done on the Hall scatter-\ning correction factor for electrons in strained material; how-\never, literature on holes suggests that a value of \u00030.5 is not\nunreasonable.15 Correcting in such a way would have the\neffect of reducing the Sb carrier concentration peak while\nincreasing Hall mobility. However, it would not be easy to\njustify theoretically such a large increase in mobility with\nstrain, when the concentration of charged scattering centers\nin the strained material is at least 5\u00021020 cm\u22123, thus pre-\nsumably damping out the contribution of band gap changes\nto mobility. According to this argument a scattering factor\nclose to unity, as we have used in Fig. 3, would appear more\nplausible. It is also worth noting that even with a correction\nfactor of 0.5, we would still have a nearly 70% increase in\npeak Sb activation combined with a mobility doubling as a\nresult of strain.\nCurrently full reasoning for our activation effect is not\noffered, but we may consider two possible explanations. The\nfirst is a donor ionization effect whereby more Sb is ionized\nin the strained substrate as a result of strain-induced\nconduction-band lowering. Temperature-dependent Hall and\nvan der Pauw measurements were carried out to search for\nsuch an effect, but the results suggest that Sb, already a very\nshallow donor in silicon, is not affected by strain in this way.\nWe believe that the most likely explanation is an increased\nlevel of Sb solubility in the strained silicon. This interpreta-\ntion is supported, although somewhat indirectly, by reports of\nenhanced activation of B in Si driven by compressive\nstrain.16,17 In this case, where the lattice strain field is com-\npressive and the local strain field around the relatively small\nsubstitutional B atom is tensile, B activation is seen to be\nincreased. This increase is attributed to a compensation effect\nbetween the two strain fields, favoring substitutional incor-\nporation of B. In our experiments substitutional Sb, being a\nlarger atom than Si, would similarly relieve the tensile lattice\nstrain field in our experiment. This, together with band gap\neffects,5 could account for the increased activation of Sb seen\nin the present study. Why such an effect has not previously\nbeen seen for As is not clear, but several suggestions are\npossible.\n\u00011\u0002 The As concentrations used were well above the thresh-\nold for As cluster formation, but below the solid sol-\nubility with respect to second-phase formation\n\u0001precipitation\u0002.\n\u00012\u0002 The layers used, being thicker than the Matthews-\nBlakeslee critical thickness,18 might have caused unfore-\nseen effects arising from higher defect densities.\n\u00013\u0002 Following the strain compensation argument, the lattice\nmismatch between As and Si is too small to cause a\nsignificant change in solubility.\nIn summary, large sheet resistance improvements for Sb-\ndoped layers produced in strained silicon have been pre-\nsented. Doping with Sb is seen to produce more highly con-\nductive layers than with As, as a consequence of combined\nimprovements in mobility and dopant activation between the\nstrained and unstrained case. For low-temperature process-\ning, strain is shown to significantly improve the activation of\nSb atoms while creating stable ultrashallow junctions to a\ndepth of \u000310 nm. The results suggest that Sb might be a\nsuperior alternative to As for creating ultrashallow junctions\nin strain-engineered complementary metal-oxide-\nsemiconductor devices.\nThe authors would like to acknowledge IQE Silicon\nCompounds Ltd. for providing the strained silicon substrates\nused in these experiments.
