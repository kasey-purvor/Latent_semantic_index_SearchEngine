Introduction  29 \n  Solar proton events (SPEs) are a major space weather phenomena that can produce hazardous 30 \neffects in the near-Earth space environment. The occurrence of SPEs varies during the 11-year 31 \nsolar activity cycle. In active years, especially during the falling and rising phases of the solar 32 \ncycle, SPEs may average one per month, but during solar minimum years the occurrence is very 33 \nlow, e.g., ~1 per year. SPEs cause 'upsets' to Earth-orbiting satellites, increased radiation 34 \nexposure levels for humans onboard spacecraft and high-altitude aircraft, ozone depletions and 35 \ndisruption to HF\/VHF communications in mid- and high-latitude regions. A detailed 36 \nunderstanding of all these impacts depends upon knowledge of the dynamic rigidity cutoffs as 37 \nSPE particles are partially guided by the geomagnetic field. Higher rigidities are required for a 38 \nparticle to reach lower geomagnetic latitudes, and thus all particles with rigidities larger than the 39 \nminimum can penetrate to that latitude (and all higher latitudes). The geomagnetic cutoff rigidity 40 \nis a dynamic quantity depending on the Earth's internal and external magnetic fields [Smart and 41 \nShea, 2003; Kress et al., 2004]. 42 \n  Experimental measurements of geomagnetic cutoff rigidities have generally been based on 43 \nsatellite observations. Few experimental studies have derived cutoffs during the most disturbed 44 \nconditions during geomagnetic storms.  Theoretical calculations have primarily focused on 45 \ntracing particles through models of the Earth's field producing grids of estimated cutoff rigidities 46 \ndistributed over the Earth at a given altitude [e.g., Smart and Shea, 2001].   Birch et al. [2005] 47 \nused satellite measurements of the edge of the polar cap sampled four times each day, and found 48 \nthat cutoff latitudes reduce by 5-8\u00ba during storms. They compared the results with particle-49 \ntracing models, which underestimated the effects of a severe storm. Rodger et al. [2006] used the 50 \nmodel of Kp-dependent geomagnetic rigidity cutoff energies based on the Tysganenko-89 51 \nmagnetic field model [Smart and Shea, 2001], to investigate for the first time, detailed 52 \ncomparisons of theoretical cutoff rigidities and ground-based measurements during a large 53 \n4 \ngeomagnetic disturbance. Energy cutoffs on satellite derived proton fluxes were used to calculate 54 \nthe predicted cosmic noise absorption levels for the Halley imaging riometer (IRIS) during a 55 \nsingle SPE event in November 2001. The predicted absorption levels showed good agreement 56 \nwith those experimentally observed for low and mid levels of geomagnetic disturbance levels 57 \n(Kp<5). However, in very disturbed conditions (Kp\u22487-9) the rigidity energy cutoffs indicated by 58 \nthe IRIS observations appeared to saturate around those predicted for Kp\u22486 by the particle-59 \ntracing approach. This suggested that the geomagnetic latitude limit for the penetration of SPE 60 \nprotons during large geomagnetic storms is rather more poleward than had been indicated 61 \npreviously.  62 \n  Imaging riometer systems (IRIS) like the one at Halley, Antarctica, are well suited for 63 \nexamining geomagnetic cutoffs, because the receiver arrays provide an image of the ionospheric 64 \nabsorption levels in a 200 km \u00d7 200 km horizontal region above the instrument by measuring the 65 \nabsorption of cosmic radio noise at a given frequency (usually 20-40 MHz). Using riometers it 66 \nhas previously been shown that there is an empirical relationship between the square root of the 67 \nintegral proton flux (>10 MeV) and cosmic noise absorption (CNA) in daytime, at least when 68 \ngeomagnetic cutoff effects do not limit the fluxes [Kavanagh et al., 2004]. The same study 69 \nconcluded that variations in the spectral hardness of the SPE proton flux and atmospheric 70 \ncollision frequencies do not cause significant departures from the linear relationship observed. 71 \n    In this paper we examine ground-based measurements during five SPEs, based on the 72 \nobservations from the imaging riometer at Halley, Antarctica, which is situated such that the 73 \nrigidity cutoff sweeps back and forth across the instrument's field of view during each SPE. We 74 \ncalculate riometer absorption, using input proton fluxes modified by rigidity cutoff calculations, 75 \nand contrast the varying, predicted and observed, rigidity cutoffs during each geomagnetic 76 \ndisturbance. We also use the Sodankyla Ion and Neutral Chemistry (SIC) model to determine an 77 \nempirical relationship between integral proton precipitation fluxes and nighttime ionosphere 78 \n5 \nriometer absorption to complement the daytime relationship already published, and to study 79 \nrigidity effects during winter time SPEs. 80 \n2. Experimental Setup 81 \n  The riometer utilizes the absorption of cosmic radio noise by the ionosphere [Little and 82 \nLeinbach, 1959] to measure the enhancement of D-region electron concentration by energetic 83 \ncharged particle precipitation [Stauning, 1996]. The riometer technique compares the strength of 84 \nthe cosmic radio noise signal received on the ground to the normal sidereal variation referred to 85 \nas the quiet-day curve to produce the cosmic noise absorption. The instantaneous ionospheric 86 \nabsorption in decibels is derived from the ratio of the prevailing signal level to this curve 87 \n[Krishnaswamy et al., 1985]. In typical operations the absorption peaks near 90 km altitude, 88 \nwhere the product of electron density and neutral collision frequency maximizes. In this paper 89 \nwe consider experimental observations from selected beams of an imaging riometer located at 90 \nHalley (75.6\u00baS, 26.32\u00b0W, L=4.6), as shown in Figure 1. 91 \n  At Halley the system is a snow-buried 49-beam imaging riometer, operating at 38.2 MHz and 92 \nsampled every 1 sec [Rose et al., 2000]. Several receivers are multiplexed through a phased array 93 \nof 64 crossed-dipole antennas to achieve narrow beam scanning of the D region. The beam width 94 \nis 13\u00ba. In the meridian plane the most equatorward and poleward beams intersect the D region 95 \nionosphere about 1\u00ba north (equatorward) and south (poleward) from the vertical central beam, 96 \nrespectively. Absorption values for obliquely orientated (non-vertical) beams are automatically 97 \ncorrected to vertical following the technique described by Hargreaves and Jarvis [1986]. 98 \n  In this study we analyze data collected at Halley during five SPEs. The SPE periods are July 99 \n2000, November 2000, two periods in November 2001, and October 2003. Prior to, and after 100 \nthese events the Halley imaging riometer performance was severely limited by snow buildup as 101 \n6 \nthe IRIS was buried [Rose et al., 2000] as a result of ever-increasing snow accumulation on the 102 \nantenna array.  103 \n 104 \n3. Estimates of Rigidity Cutoffs 105 \n  It has been recognized for some time that geomagnetic rigidity cutoffs are well-ordered in terms 106 \nof the McIlwain L-parameter [Smart and Shea, 1994; Selesnick et al., 1995]. The L-variation of 107 \nthe geomagnetic rigidity cutoff has been determined for quiet times from \u224810,000 nuclei 108 \nobservations made by the MAST instrument on the SAMPEX satellite [Ogliore et al., 2001]. 109 \nThese authors report that the geomagnetic rigidity cutoffs, Rc, for quiet times are given by 110 \n     Rc = 15.062 L-2 - 0.363   (in GV)  (1) 111 \nrepresenting average conditions for Kp=2.3. As noted above, dynamic vertical cutoff rigidities 112 \ndependent upon magnetic activity levels have been determined by particle-tracing [Smart and 113 \nShea, 2003] using the Kp-dependent Tsyganenko magnetospheric field model. These authors 114 \nhave reported that the change of proton cutoff energy with Kp is relatively uniform over the range 115 \nof the original Tsyganenko (1989) model (Kp<5), but the cutoff changes introduced by the 116 \nBoberg et al. [1995] extension to higher Kp is non-linear such that there are large changes in 117 \nproton cutoff energy for a given L-value at large Kp values. Rodger et al. [2006] made use of the 118 \nKp-dependent variations in the effective vertical cutoff energies at a given IGRF L-value at 119 \n450 km altitude determined from this modeling [Smart et al., Fig. 5, 2003], but with a slight 120 \nmodification to ensure that the geomagnetic rigidity cutoff varies as 15.062 L-2, as observed in 121 \nthe SAMPEX experimental data. Note that the change in cutoff energy with geomagnetic activity 122 \nis strongly non-linear at the highest disturbance levels. In order to interpolate down to lower 123 \naltitudes (e.g., 100 km), Rodger et al. [2006] followed the approach outlined by Smart and Shea 124 \n[2003] again using the IGRF determined L-value. This exploits the basic relationship between Rc 125 \nand L, i.e., 126 \n7 \n     Rc = Vk L-2       (2) 127 \nwhere Vk is an altitude independent constant. Thus by knowing the value of Vk for the IGRF L-128 \nvalue at 450 km altitude above a given location, one can determine Rc at 100 km once one knows 129 \nthe L-value for that location at 100 km altitude. In the Rodger-approach the upper limit for Kp in 130 \nthe rigidity model is Kp=6. When Kp exceeds this level then it is forced to Kp=6 in the rigidity 131 \ncalculations, a limit selected through contrast with the November 2001 experimental 132 \nobservations. 133 \n  The rigidity cutoff relationship developed by Smart and Shea [2003], and tested and improved 134 \nby Rodger et al. [2006] is further investigated here using a series of SPEs observed by the 135 \nimaging riometer at Halley. 136 \n 137 \n4. Daytime riometer data and calculated absorption 138 \n  Figure 2 shows three days of experimentally-observed cosmic noise absorptions recorded by 139 \ntwo of the meridional beams of the Halley IRIS instrument (i.e., pointing N-S) during the 8-11 140 \nNovember 2000 SPE with 15 min averaging. In the upper panel CNA are shown for the IRIS 141 \nsouthernmost beam 1 (L=4.80, solid line, which we term the \"poleward beam\"), and in the 142 \nmiddle panel the northernmost beam 7, (L=4.32, long dashed line, which we term the 143 \n\"equatorward beam\"). The beams map to the ionosphere so as to be viewing ~1\u00ba north and south 144 \nin latitude (i.e. 75.6\u00baS \u00b11\u00ba). These two beams represent the two most extreme locations for 145 \nrigidity cutoff effects that the instrument can observe. The bottom panel shows the variation of 146 \nKp during the SPE. In addition, both the upper and middle panels show the variation of the non-147 \ncutoff absorption that would be expected if there were no influence of rigidity on the proton 148 \nfluxes into the atmosphere (short dashed line) based on the relationship between daytime 149 \nabsorption and proton fluxes developed by Kavanagh et al. [2004], i.e., using Absorption=0.09 \u00d7 150 \n(>10 MeV proton flux)0.5. This line therefore represents the variation of the proton fluxes 151 \n8 \nthroughout the event. The equivalent absorption levels using rigidity affected proton fluxes 152 \ndetermined through the approach outlined in section 3 for each beam location are also shown 153 \n(asterisk in the south, diamond in the north), again calculated using the Kavanagh et al. [2004] 154 \nrelationship. The time resolution of these calculations is limited to 3-hours because of the Kp 155 \ndependence of the rigidity cutoff model. 156 \n  The SPE of 8-11 November 2000 generated peak GOES proton fluxes of  14,800 >10 MeV 157 \nprotons cm-2 str-1 s-1 at 16 UT on 9 Nov, and a peak Kp of 6+ at 9-12 UT on 10 Nov. As such, this 158 \nevent occurred during a moderate geomagnetic storm. During November the atmosphere above 159 \nHalley, Antarctica, is fully sunlit and thus the use of the Kavanagh et al. [2004] daytime 160 \nabsorption relationship is appropriate. In the southern (poleward) beam absorption levels of 161 \n~4 dB are observed during the period of highest proton fluxes, while in the northern 162 \n(equatorward) beam absorption levels of ~2 dB are observed. These values are generally in good 163 \nagreement with the estimated absorption levels when the effects of varying rigidity cutoffs are 164 \nincluded, and significantly below the non-cutoff levels of ~8 dB absorption. When the proton 165 \nfluxes are very low the predicted absorption remains close to zero whatever the Kp level, thus it 166 \nis only possible to compare the predicted absorption with the observed absorption when the 167 \nproton fluxes are elevated. For the SPE of 8-11 November 2000 this is after 00 UT on 9 Nov, 168 \nlasting until the end of 10 Nov. Of the fifteen 3-hourly bins, 5 show significant over estimates 169 \n(~2 dB) in the predicted absorption in the southern (poleward) beam, while only 2 over estimates 170 \noccur in the northern (equatorward) beam. The remaining periods show reasonable agreement 171 \nbetween the predicted and observed absorption levels typically to within \u00b10.5 dB. Periods where 172 \nthe absorption is higher than the predicted absorption level are likely to be influenced by 173 \nadditional factors such as electron precipitation [Shirochkov et al., 2004], which leads to 174 \nadditional absorption on top of the proton-induced absorption, and are therefore not well 175 \ndescribed by the proton-only Kavanagh et al. [2004] relationship. One example of this 176 \n9 \noccurrence is 00-06 UT on 9 November 2000, where higher than predicted absorption is seen on 177 \nboth beams.  178 \n  There are two periods where the data and theory disagree during the 8-11 November 2000 179 \nevent. At 6-12 UT on 10 Nov Kp reaches 6, and the theoretical absorption levels are the same as 180 \nthe non-cutoff case, i.e., a very high proportion of the proton fluxes should be impacting the 181 \natmosphere above the riometer. But, both the northern and southern beam absorption levels 182 \nindicate that there is still significant rigidity cutoff influence at this time. The second anomalous 183 \nperiod occurs at 14 UT on 9 Nov in the southern (poleward) beam. The theoretical absorption 184 \nlevels increase from ~2 dB to ~4 dB in response to a small increase in Kp from <2 to 3+. This is 185 \nnot seen in the observed absorption. 186 \n  Figures 3, 4, and 5 show plots in the same format as Figure 2, and represent SPEs occurring 187 \nduring 26-29 November 2000, 5-8 November 2001, and 28-31 October 2003 respectively. The 188 \npeak proton >10 MeV fluxes were 942, 31700, and 29500 protons cm-2 str-1 s-1 while the 189 \nmaximum Kp values were 6+, 9-, and 9 respectively. Thus Figure 3 represents a small SPE, and 190 \nFigures 4 and 5 represent two very large SPEs, with the latter cases associated with very large 191 \ngeomagnetic disturbances. 192 \n  Although the proton fluxes are significantly lower during the 26-29 November 2000 SPE when 193 \ncompared with the 8-11 November 2000 event, the maximum Kp values are the same (6+). Thus 194 \nthese two events are comparable in many ways. Figure 3 shows that the theoretical absorption 195 \nlevels in the southern (poleward) and northern (equatorward) beams are over estimated in 196 \ncomparison with the absorption data, particularly when Kp=~6 in the northern (equatorward) 197 \nbeam, and Kp=4-6 in the southern (poleward) beam. This is particularly apparent when the 198 \nproton fluxes are high, and the absorption levels significantly elevated. Of the twenty three 3-199 \nhourly bins where proton fluxes are high, 9 show significant over estimates (~0.5-1 dB) in the 200 \n10 \npredicted absorption in the southern (poleward) beam, while only 5 over estimates occur in the 201 \nnorthern (equatorward) beam. 202 \n  The two large storms shown in Figure 4 and 5 have a wider range of Kp values, but follow 203 \nsimilar patterns of behavior as Figure 3. The northern (equatorial) beam shows good agreement 204 \nbetween the theoretical absorption and the observed data until Kp>~6. Under these conditions the 205 \ntheoretically determined rigidity cutoffs predict very little influence of cutoff rigidity (i.e., low 206 \ncutoff energies) on the proton fluxes and thus high absorption levels, but the observed absorption 207 \nlevels are more consistent with Kp=~5 and thus a significant influence due to rigidity cutoffs 208 \nlimiting the proton fluxes. The southern (poleward) beam shows good agreement between 209 \ntheoretical absorption levels and observed absorption for very high Kp (Kp>6), but over estimated 210 \nabsorptions when Kp=4-6. During high Kp (Kp>6) the theory predicts, and the observations show, 211 \nthat there is little or no cutoff rigidity affect on the absorption levels for this beam location. Of 212 \nthe twenty three 3-hourly bins where proton fluxes are high in Figure 4, six show significant over 213 \nestimates (~2 dB) in the predicted absorption in the southern (poleward) beam, while only 3 over 214 \nestimates occur in the northern (equatorward) beam. Of the nineteen 3-hourly bins where proton 215 \nfluxes are high in Figure 5, five show significant over estimates (~2 dB) in the predicted 216 \nabsorption in the southern (poleward) beam, while 8 over estimates occur in the northern 217 \n(equatorward) beam. This represents an unusual event because the northern beam is less well 218 \nmodeled than the southern beam. The primary reason is because of the unusually long-lasting 219 \nvery high Kp levels leading to less errors in the southern beam in comparison with the northern 220 \nbeam. 221 \n  The Halley riometer data during the SPE of 5-8 November 2001 was previously used to test the 222 \nimproved rigidity cutoff calculations developed by Rodger et al. [2006]. The cutoff rigidities 223 \nwere applied to the proton fluxes in the same way as this study, but the SIC model was used to 224 \ncalculate the riometer absorption instead of using the empirical relationship as we do here. 225 \n11 \nComparing Figure 4 in this study with Figure 7 of Rodger et al. [2006] shows that combining the 226 \nempirical relationship with rigidity modified proton fluxes agrees closely with the SIC model 227 \nresults. In addition, the right panel of Figure 3 of Rodger et al. [2006] showed that the 228 \nabsorptions calculated by the SIC model in the absence of rigidity cutoff effects reproduces the 229 \nempirical relationship reported by Kavanagh et al. [2004].  230 \n  So far we have described riometer absorption observed during four SPEs that occurred during 231 \nthe southern hemisphere summer, and thus under daytime conditions. In the next section we 232 \ndetermine a nighttime relationship between proton fluxes and riometer absorption in order to 233 \ninvestigate rigidity cutoff effects during polar winter nighttime conditions. 234 \n5. Nighttime riometer absorption using the Sodankyl\u00e4 Ion and Neutral Chemistry Model 235 \n  As in Rodger et al. [2006] we use the SIC model to produce lower ionospheric electron density 236 \nprofiles during SPEs, but this time in the winter-time (i.e. nighttime) D-region above the Halley 237 \nBay IRIS instrument. During the daytime it is possible to calculate the non-cutoff riometer 238 \nabsorption using >10 MeV proton fluxes through the empirical relationship of Kavanagh et al. 239 \n[2004], confirmed using the SIC model by Rodger et al. [2006]. Here we want to investigate the 240 \nrelationship between proton fluxes and riometer absorption during nighttime conditions in order 241 \nto investigate rigidity cutoff effects during polar winter conditions. 242 \n  We assume that the proton spectra at the top of the atmosphere will be determined only by the 243 \nfluxes of experimentally observed proton flux spectra reported by GOES-borne instruments at 244 \ngeosynchronous altitude. The angular distribution of the protons is assumed to be isotropic over 245 \nthe upper atmosphere, which is valid close to the Earth [Hargreaves, 1992]. A SIC modeling run 246 \nhas also been undertaken without any proton forcing (i.e., zero proton fluxes), reasonable at 247 \nHalley for low Kp conditions. The results of the no-forcing \"control\" SIC-run allow the 248 \ncalculation of \"quiet-time\" conditions. 249 \n12 \n  Each run of the SIC model is based on a neutral background atmosphere given by MSISE-90 250 \nand provides concentration profiles of neutral and ionic species. Following Banks and Kockarts 251 \n[1973; Part A, p. 194], we calculate the electron collision frequencies of N2, O2, and He from 252 \nMSIS and of O and H from SIC using the neutral temperature profile of MSIS, which we can 253 \nassume to be equal to electron temperature below 100 km. Electron density is obtained from SIC 254 \nby subtracting the sum of negative ion concentrations from the sum of positive ion 255 \nconcentrations. Finally, we use the method of Sen and Wyller [1960] to compute differential 256 \nabsorption dL\/dh and integrate with respect to height. This method takes the operational 257 \nfrequency of the riometer into account and assumes a dipole approximation for the geomagnetic 258 \nfield to obtain the electron gyrofrequency at the respective altitude and latitude. 259 \n  The Sodankyl\u00e4 Ion and Neutral Chemistry (SIC) model is a 1-D chemical model designed for 260 \nionospheric D-region studies, solving the concentrations of 65 ions, including 29 negative ions, 261 \nand 15 neutral species at altitudes across 20\u2013150 km. This study makes use of SIC version 6.9.0. 262 \nThe model has recently been discussed by Verronen et al. [2005], building on original work by 263 \nTurunen et al. [1996] and Verronen et al. [2002]. A detailed overview of the model was given in 264 \nVerronen et al. [2005]. We summarize here to provide background for this study. 265 \n  In the SIC model several hundred reactions are implemented, plus additional external forcing 266 \ndue to solar radiation (1\u2013422.5 nm), electron and proton precipitation, and galactic cosmic 267 \nradiation. Initial descriptions of the model are provided by Turunen et al. [1996], with neutral 268 \nspecies modifications described by Verronen et al. [2002]. Solar flux is calculated with the 269 \nSOLAR2000 model (version 2.27) [Tobiska et al., 2000]. The scattered component of solar 270 \nLyman-\u03b1 flux is included using the empirical approximation given by Thomas and Bowman 271 \n[1986]. The SIC code includes vertical transport [Chabrillat et al., 2002] which takes into 272 \naccount molecular [Banks and Kockarts, 1973] and eddy diffusion with a fixed eddy diffusion 273 \ncoefficient profile. The background neutral atmosphere is calculated using the MSISE-90 model 274 \n13 \n[Hedin, 1991] and tables given by Shimazaki [1984]. Transport and chemistry are advanced in 275 \nintervals of 5 or 15 minutes. While within each interval exponentially increasing time steps are 276 \nused because of the wide range of chemical time constants of the modeled species. 277 \n  Daytime absorption has been shown to be described by proton fluxes with energies >10 MeV. 278 \nHowever, during nighttime conditions the undisturbed D-region has lower electron number 279 \ndensities, such that lower energy protons are expected to play a significant role.  Nighttime 280 \nionization conditions are more complicated than during the day, with a negative charge transition 281 \nfrom electrons to negative ions occurring at sunset [Verronen et al., 2006] as a result of changes 282 \nin atomic oxygen. Thus we would expect different relationships between absorption and solar 283 \nproton fluxes at night than during the day. Figure 6 shows the relationship found between SIC 284 \ncalculated polar nighttime riometer absorption and proton fluxes with energies >5 MeV, taken 285 \nfrom the proton fluxes which occurred during the January 2005 SPE. These calculations indicate 286 \nthat nighttime absorption is proportional to (>5 MeV proton flux)0.75. This finding differs from 287 \nthe daytime relationship, not only in the power, but also the proton flux threshold. This agrees 288 \nwith previous work on nighttime absorption calculations, which suggested a threshold of 1-5 289 \nMeV  [Sellers et al., 1977], although both day and night calculations in that study used a square 290 \nroot power relationship. A lower threshold of >5 MeV during nighttime means that Kp would 291 \nhave to be lower in order to cutoff the same fraction of the proton fluxes as during the day. The 292 \nlower energy threshold is also consistent with the riometer absorption coming from higher 293 \naltitudes during the night than the day. 294 \n  During the period when IRIS data from Halley is available there was one significant SPE in 295 \nnighttime conditions. In Figure 7 we show the observed and calculated absorption during the 296 \nlarge SPE of 13-16 July 2000. The format of the plot is the same as Figures 2-5. To calculate the 297 \ntheoretical absorption values we have used the relation Absorption = 0.001\u00d7(>5 MeV proton 298 \nflux)0.75. The plot shows that the theoretical and observed absorption values agree well, with 299 \n14 \noverestimates in the theoretically predicted absorptions occurring only on the southern 300 \n(poleward) beam when Kp>7. No significant periods of over estimation occur on the northern 301 \n(equatorward) beam. Of the eleven 3-hourly bins where proton fluxes are high in Figure 7, five 302 \nshow significant over estimates (~0.5 dB) in the predicted absorption in the southern (poleward) 303 \nbeam, while four over estimates occur in the northern (equatorward) beam. 304 \n  Notably there are almost no data points in Figure 7 where either the predicted absorption or the 305 \nobserved absorption reach the same levels as the non-cutoff values during high proton fluxes 306 \n(mainly 15 July). This is despite very high Kp values, and is partly as a result of the rigidity 307 \nmodel limiting Kp to a maximum of 6, and also a result of the >5 MeV energy threshold used 308 \nduring the night. At the latitude of Halley IRIS northern (equatorward) beam the proton cutoff 309 \nenergy limit for Kp=6 is ~9 MeV [Rodger et al., 2006]. This means that protons with energies 310 \n>9 MeV will reach to the latitude of this beam, but energies less than that will not be able to 311 \nmake it so far equatorward. During the day, when a >10 MeV proton flux energy threshold for 312 \nthe absorption calculation applies, and the Kp-dependent rigidity cutoff is ~9 MeV, 100% of the 313 \n>10 MeV GOES proton fluxes will penetrate to that location, and thus contribute to the riometer 314 \nabsorption. However, during the night when a >5 MeV proton flux energy threshold applies, and 315 \nthe Kp-dependent rigidity cutoff is ~9 MeV, the calculations predict that only ~30-90% of the 316 \n>5 MeV GOES proton fluxes penetrate to that location and contribute to the riometer absorption. 317 \nNote that the 30-90% range is determined by the proton spectra, i.e., what percentage of the total 318 \nproton number flux is greater than the rigidity cutoff energy. Thus at nighttime the only time that 319 \nthe predicted absorption gets close to the non-rigidity cutoff levels is on those occasions when 320 \nthe proton spectrum is very hard, i.e., there are high fluxes of protons with high energy 321 \n(>10 MeV) in comparison with the lower energy protons (5-10 MeV).   322 \n 323 \n7. Discussion 324 \n15 \n  We have investigated the rigidity cutoff model developed by Rodger et al. [2006] based on 325 \nprevious work by Smart and Shea [2003]. Using a study of riometer absorption data during four 326 \ndaytime SPEs, i.e., high latitude summer measurements where the Sun is above the horizon all 327 \nthe time, we have shown that it is possible to reproduce the riometer data using a simple 328 \nempirical relationship based on the incident proton fluxes, and a Kp-limited rigidity calculation.  329 \n  For the southern (poleward) beam of the Halley IRIS Kp=6 represents a rigidity cutoff energy of 330 \n0.0 MeV, and once Kp=6 is reached the predicted absorption is the same as the non-rigidity 331 \nabsorption levels. This can be seen in Figure 3 at the beginning of 27 Nov 2000, where the 332 \nasterisks (rigidity calculation) overlap the short dashed line values (non-rigidity calculation). 333 \nHowever, the observed absorption is not consistent with this picture, and when Kp>4 the 334 \npredicted absorption is also over estimated. This suggests that the rigidity cutoff limit (Kp=6, 335 \n0.0 MeV for the southern beam) needs to be higher than the proton flux energy threshold 336 \n(10 MeV in daytime). Either decreasing the Kp \"saturation\" limit, or lowering the proton flux 337 \nenergy threshold can achieve this.  338 \n  During the two large SPEs, when Kp approached 9, the southern (poleward) beam absorption 339 \nwas close to that of the calculated rigidity and non-rigidity cutoff absorption levels (Figures 4 340 \nand 5), whereas this was not true when Kp=4-6 in the previous analysis. This clearly indicates 341 \nthat the Kp=6 saturation limit to the rigidity cutoff model is too low and needs to be higher. 342 \n  For the northern (equatorward) beam of the Halley IRIS Kp=6 represents a rigidity cutoff 343 \nenergy of 9 MeV, thus the rigidity cutoff energy and the proton flux energy threshold (10 MeV) 344 \nare similar, and when Kp=6 is reached the predicted absorption values are the same as the non-345 \nrigidity levels. However, the observed absorption does not reach the non-rigidity level during 346 \nhigh proton fluxes, and as a result this suggests that the Kp=6 saturation limit is too high or the 347 \nabsorption threshold is too high. 348 \n16 \n  Absorption data from the single nighttime SPE (July 2000) is reasonably modeled using a 349 \n>5 MeV proton flux energy threshold. The behavior of the observed absorption on the southern 350 \n(poleward) beam is very similar to the daytime examples in that the predicted absorption is over 351 \nestimated when Kp\u22656. This is because at Kp=6 the rigidity cutoff energy is 0.0 MeV which is 352 \nlower than the proton flux energy threshold of >5 MeV. The northern (equatorward) beam 353 \nbehavior is slightly different from the daytime case because for Kp=6 the rigidity cutoff energy 354 \n(9 MeV) is more than the proton flux energy threshold (>5 MeV), and thus although the 355 \npredicted absorption is still an overestimate at high Kp, it is not as large as the maximum non-356 \ncutoff case. 357 \n  Using the rigidity cutoff model of Rodger et al. [2006] and empirical estimates of riometer 358 \nabsorption from proton fluxes we have been able to reproduce the absorption seen by the Halley 359 \nriometer at two L-shells (L=4.32 and 4.80). Typically reasonable estimates of absorption were 360 \nmade 58-74 % of the time for the southern (poleward) beam, and 65-87 % of the time for the 361 \nnorthern (equatorward) beam. The success of the Rodger et al. [2006] rigidity cutoff model is 362 \ndependent on a balance between the rigidity cutoff energy for the protons at any given L-shell, 363 \nand the proton flux energy threshold for the protons. At the times when the empirical estimates 364 \nare in error there is usually an over estimate in the predicted absorption levels, caused by the 365 \nKp=6 saturation limit used in the rigidity cutoff calculation. In order to improve the success rate 366 \nfor the northern (equatorward) beam the Kp saturation limit in the rigidity model would have to 367 \nbe decreased to Kp=5.5 or the daytime proton flux energy threshold decreased to >5 MeV. For 368 \nthe southern beam changing the Kp saturation limit to 5 would be more appropriate, but no 369 \nchanges of the daytime proton flux energy threshold would make any significant effect. 370 \n  Changing the proton flux energy threshold introduces significant difficulties in modeling the 371 \nriometer absorption because of hysteresis in the relationship between the proton fluxes and 372 \nabsorption for any proton flux energy threshold values other than 10 MeV during the day and 373 \n17 \n5 MeV during the night. Thus we restrict ourselves here to investigate the effects of the Kp 374 \nsaturation limit used in the rigidity cutoff calculation. Figure 8 shows the northern and southern 375 \nbeam absorption during the solar proton event of 05-08 November 2001. The figure is the same 376 \nformat as Figure 4, except that the saturation limit has been changed to Kp=5, and the location of 377 \nthe southern (poleward) beam moved by 0.6\u00b0 equatorwards. These changes have the effect of 378 \nincreasing the rigidity cutoff energy for the northern beam from 9 MeV to 28 MeV, and 379 \nincreasing the rigidity cutoff energy for the southern beam from 0.0 MeV to 8 MeV. In practice 380 \nthis means that the northern beam does not achieve the non-rigidity cutoff absorption maximum 381 \nduring this storm, in agreement with the observations. Generally the Halley northern 382 \n(equatorward) beam will not achieve the non-rigidity cutoff  absorption maximum unless the 383 \nproton spectrum is very hard and has little flux between 10-28 MeV. The southern beam will still 384 \nexperience absorption at the non-cutoff maximum, but the more equatorward location of the 385 \nbeam results in lower levels of absorption when Kp is just below the saturation  limit. Both of 386 \nthese effects result in much better agreement between the calculated absorption and the observed 387 \nabsorption for this large geomagnetic storm in comparison with the results shown in Figure 4. 388 \n  However, for moderately disturbed solar proton events, where Kp remains close to the 389 \nsaturation limit the calculated absorption is not in such good agreement with the observations. 390 \nFigure 9 shows the adjusted absorption for the 26-29 November 2000 period to be contracted 391 \nwith Figure 3. The Kp=5 saturation limit has reduced the northern beam absorption, and reduced 392 \nthe southern beam absorption when Kp is close to the Kp=5 saturation limit. However, during 393 \nhigher Kp the southern beam does not experience the maximum non-rigidity cutoff absorption 394 \nlevels that the relocated beam calculations predict. Overall there is a 50% decrease in the number 395 \nof 3-hour data bins that previously showed poor agreement between the calculated and observed 396 \nabsorption. 397 \n18 \n  The adjustments to the rigidity cutoff calculations made here are relatively subtle. By changing 398 \nthe location of the southern (poleward) beam better agreement between theory and observations 399 \nis obtained at times, and this indicates that initially the two beam locations were too far apart 400 \n(i.e., smaller than the 2\u00b0 of latitude assumed initially). The adjusted location for the southern 401 \n(poleward) beam represents a separation from the northern beam of 1.4\u00b0 of latitude, which can be 402 \ninterpreted as indicating that the dominant altitude that the absorption is occurring at lower 403 \naltitude i.e., 60 km instead of the 90 km initially assumed. The lower Kp saturation limit 404 \nimproves the agreement between theory and observations, particularly on the northern 405 \n(equatorward) beam during most geomagnetic conditions. The Kp change has little effect on the 406 \nsouthern (equatorward) beam, which appears more sensitive to changes in beam location. This 407 \nsuggests that at L>4.5, and for high Kp, significant changes in L-shell location have occurred for 408 \nthe beam, in particular that the geographic location of the beam has moved to a lower L-shell. 409 \nSome of this change can be accommodated by the lowering of the peak absorption altitude of the 410 \nsouthern beam, which equates to a shift equatorwards for this riometer beam as Kp increases and 411 \ngreater latitudinal penetration of proton fluxes occur.  412 \n  For large geomagnetic storms, such as that of 05-08 November 2001, the adjustments made 413 \nhere to the Rodger et al. [2006] rigidity cutoff model allow us to improve the absorption 414 \nestimates. In Figure 10 we plot the predicted southern hemisphere absorption levels during the 415 \nhigh proton flux period that occurred at 00 UT on 06 Nov 2001, when Kp reached 8+. This 416 \ncalculation was undertaken using the improved rigidity cutoff model. The plot shows the region 417 \nof high absorption with levels of 14 dB, where all protons with energies greater than 10 MeV can 418 \naccess the polar atmosphere (i.e., rigidity cutoff effects are unimportant to the riometer 419 \nabsorptions). Surrounding this contour is an outer region where the absorption levels gradually 420 \nreduce to the limits of detectability for most riometers (roughly 0.1 dB). This can be thought of 421 \n19 \nas an extreme example of SPE-produced riometer absorptions, occurring when both Kp and 422 \nproton fluxes are very high. The outer zone of rigidity influenced absorption lies mostly at 50\u00b0S, 423 \nexcept in the region of the Antarctic Peninsula where it is located at ~70\u00b0S. From the riometer 424 \nabsorption calculations we can see that the transition in access levels for energetic protons to the 425 \nstratosphere and mesosphere is controlled by geomagnetic rigidity, with the shift from no-access 426 \nto total access occurs over the range L=3-4.5, or across ~10\u00b0 of latitude. For locations which are 427 \nequatorward of the limits of the outer zone shown in Figure 10, SPEs should never lead to 428 \nsignificant changes in riometer data. This provides an indication as to the limits inside which 429 \nSPEs can play a role in modifying the neutral chemistry of the stratosphere and mesosphere 430 \n[Verronen, 2005]. 431 \n 432 \n8. Summary 433 \n  In the polar atmosphere, significant chemical and ionization changes occur during solar proton 434 \nevents. The access of solar protons to this region is limited by the dynamically changing 435 \ngeomagnetic field. In this study we have used riometer absorption observations to investigate the 436 \naccuracy of a model to predict Kp-dependent geomagnetic rigidity cutoffs, and hence the 437 \nchanging proton fluxes. The imaging riometer at Halley, Antarctica is ideally situated for such a 438 \nstudy, as the rigidity cutoff sweeps back and forth across the instrument's field of view, 439 \nproviding a severe test of the rigidity cutoff model. Specifically we investigate the accuracy of 440 \nthe rigidity cutoff model developed by Smart and Shea [2003], and improved by Rodger et al. 441 \n[2006]. Using observations from the Halley riometer during five solar proton events, we have 442 \nconfirmed the basic accuracy of this rigidity model. However, we have shown that although the 443 \nrigidity cutoff model can be used to reasonably estimate the absorption due to precipitating 444 \nproton fluxes, it can be further improved by setting a lower Kp limit (i.e. Kp=5 instead of 6) at 445 \n20 \nwhich the rigidity process saturates. We also find that for L>4.5 there is significant change in the 446 \ngeomagnetic location of a riometer beam during a large geomagnetic storm, such that the 447 \napparent L-shell of the beam moves equatorward. This is in part explained by the decreasing 448 \naltitude of peak riometer absorption as protons penetrate more readily at higher Kp into the 449 \nrigidity dominated zone. 450 \n  We have also used the Sodankyla Ion and Neutral Chemistry model to determine an empirical 451 \nrelationship between integral proton precipitation fluxes and nighttime ionosphere riometer 452 \nabsorption, in order to allow consideration of winter time SPEs. We find that during the 453 \nnighttime the proton flux energy threshold is lowered to protons with energies of >5 MeV in 454 \ncomparison with >10 MeV during the daytime.  455 \n  Where both Kp and proton fluxes are very high the transition in access levels for energetic 456 \nprotons to the stratosphere and mesosphere is controlled by geomagnetic rigidity, with the shift 457 \nfrom no-access to total access occurs over the range L=3-4.5, or across ~10\u00b0 of latitude. The 458 \nouter zone of rigidity influenced absorption lies mostly at 50\u00b0S, except in the region of the 459 \nAntarctic Peninsula where it is located at ~70\u00b0S. In the northern hemisphere this will equate to 460 \n~45\u00b0N. These latitude bounds provide an indication as to the limits inside which SPEs can play a 461 \nrole in modifying the neutral chemistry of the stratosphere and mesosphere. 462 \n 463 \nAcknowledgments.
