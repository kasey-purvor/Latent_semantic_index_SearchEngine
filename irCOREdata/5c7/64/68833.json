The first photographs from the Apollo space mis-\nsions changed once more the view of the earth and yielded\none of the most iconic and ubiquitous images ever produced.\nToday it is digital and satellite mapping technologies that have\ncaught the attention of a new generation of artists and do-it-\nyourself (DIY) technologists, who are exploring the use of\nportable, networked, location-aware computing devices for\nuser-led mapping, social networking and artistic interventions\nin which the fabric of the urban environment and the con-\ntours of the earth become a \u201ccanvas\u201d [2].\nAll art engages in location to some degree, even if just in\nthe way that it responds to the space created by gallery and\nframe, or the way that the found object is marked by the ab-\nsence of the location from which it was drawn. If a precursor\nto locative media were to be identified within the art world, it\nmight be the work of Richard Long, who creates his art by walk-\ning through a landscape, annotating the physical environment\nhe encounters with stones or other ambient materials, and\ndocumenting this augmented space, creating photographs\nthat provide an esoteric other to the objectifying gaze of car-\ntography or satellite photography.\nIf net art is the art of the Internet, then locative art is the\nart of mobile and wireless systems [3]. The emergence of lo-\ncative media signals a convergence of geographical and data\nspace that comes about as soon as computing becomes mo-\nbile or ambient, reversing the trend toward the view of digital\ncontent as placeless, only encountered in the amorphous and\nother space of the Internet [4]. The exploratory movements\nof locative art are located between the art of communications\nand networking and the arts of landscape, walking and the en-\nvironment. Artists are responding to the technical possibili-\nties of electronic mapping and positioning technologies and\nlocation-aware, networked media by asking what can be ex-\nperienced now that could not be \nexperienced before, in some cases\ncreating more or less conventional\nscreen-based visualizations using lo-\ncation data, in others mapping new\nhorizons for creative content and\nthe art object and a new under-\nstanding of the relation between\nphysical and digital.\nLocative art and locative media\nare less focused on positioning than\non the preconditions of moving or\nbeing able to move. This paper is\nlikewise concerned with the pre-\nconditions for a locative art rather\nthan with a set of current projects\nor artifacts. It is specifically con-\ncerned with the period between 2003 and 2004 [5]. At that\ntime locative media was in an embryonic state, everything still\nup for grabs; a zone of consistency was yet to emerge. While\nartists such as Masaki Fujihata ( Japan), Teri Rueb (U.S.A.),\nStefan Schemat (Germany) and Iain Mott (Australia) had for\nmany years been producing work we may term locative art, in\nthis period locative media and locative art were simultaneously\nopening up new ways of engaging in the world and mapping\ntheir own domain. This resonates with Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s\nsense of territory, in which there is a blurring of the distinc-\ntion between real estate and intellectual property, between the\nmapping of physical space and the production of an artistic\nor cultural milieu: the territory is constituted by the signature\nor expressive mark, both in the sense that birds use song to\nmap their domain and that the artist creates a new way of see-\ning and occupying the world.\nA TAXONOMY OF LOCATIVE ARTS\nA focus on this period enables us to study the stem cells of \nlocative media and locative arts and thus refuse a narrow \nunderstanding of locative media that has since emerged. \nA classification of locative art projects that is useful for initial\norientation might include the categories mapping, geo-\nannotation and ambulant (walking or moving about).\nMapping\nDigital mapping is at the core of many locative projects, and\nthere is a vibrant area of locative media that defines itself pri-\nmarily as a grassroots, open version of GIS (Geographic In-\nformation Systems).\nOpen and Wiki Maps. One approach that has become com-\nmon is to generate line drawings from global positioning\nsystem (GPS) data generated by people moving through the\nphysical environment.

The basic car-\ntographic technique of generated line\ndrawings enables the creation of digital\nmaps that are not dependent upon any\npreviously existing data set, such as U.K.\nOrdinance Survey (OS) data. This makes\npossible user-generated, editable maps\nthat work on the same \u201copen\u201d principles\nas those behind projects such as Wiki-\npedia, where content is generated and\nmaintained by the users. With such \u201cwiki-\nmaps\u201d it is not just individual landmarks\nthat are created and maintained by users,\nbut the features of the landscape and ge-\nographical information as well.\nIn Amsterdam RealTime, by Ester Polak\n(the Netherlands), an early, seminal \nlocative-media piece, participants roamed\nthe streets of Amsterdam equipped with\nnetworked GPS devices, and traces of\ntheir movements were relayed to a pro-\njection screen in an exhibition space \n(Article Frontispiece). At the outset the\nscreen is blank, but as the journeys are\nrecorded, individual meanderings fuse\ninto a composite representation of how\npeople occupy and use the city\u2014den-\nsity and concentration are recorded in\nthe luminescence of overlapping lines;\nspaces unvisited remain dark. While, as\nEric Kluitenberg pointed out during the\nISEA2004 conference, such composite\nimages generated through successive su-\nperimpositions are statistical in nature,\nthe project offers an evocative visual por-\ntrait of the life of the city and a grassroots,\ncollaborative mapping of how urban\nspace is used that offers an alternative \nto the top-down perspective of conven-\ntional cartography.\nFigurative, Expressive, Performative.\nGPS Drawing, by Jeremy Wood (U.K.),\nuses this same technique to create not re-\neven if this be abstracted to just a line or\ndot, affects the way people act and move\nin the present.\nSocial, Semantic. Much current inter-\nest is concerned with the interface be-\ntween locative media and social software,\nthe semantic web or web 2.0. Such maps\ncan be combined with calendar tools \nor with social software so that users are\n\u201cable to find things\u2014events\/pictures\/\nanything\u2014\u2018near\u2019 to them, where \u2018near\u2019\ncan mean close in geographical location,\nin \u2018person space,\u2019 or in \u2018interest space\u2019\u201d\n[8]. Metaphors such as \u201ca programma-\nble and machine-readable world,\u201d \u201cpeo-\nple search engines,\u201d \u201csocial interfaces to\nplaces,\u201d \u201ccity as canvas or medium\u201d and\n\u201cperson as cursor in the city\u201d abound.\nThere is a strong current of social proj-\nects within locative media, and a DIY\ntechnology culture has grown around \nit as part of a wider space that includes\ncopyleft, open source, free networking,\netc. In an arts context, mobile social\nnetworking and social network analysis\nhave been explored in the work Trace En-\ncounters. Infrared pins given to the audi-\nence at Ars Electronica 2004 detected\nand recorded any other pin that passed\nwithin range. The connections between\npins, and\u2014by implication\u2014people, were\nvisualized in the gallery to display \u201ccliques\u201d\nand shared patterns of movement (of a\nsimilar kind to those explored in the Fa-\nmiliar Strangers project).\nGeo-Annotation\n\u201cGeo-annotation\u201d is a central concept\nwithin locative media and is here under-\nstood as making data geographically spe-\ncific or placing a digital object in space.\nGeo-annotation involves authoring me-\ndia in an environment and accessing it at\nthat same location. Media contents\u2014dig-\nital photos, for example\u2014are assigned\nspatial coordinates, recording the place\nat which they were taken as metadata\n(data about data), in the same way that\ntime and date are stored. These photos\nmay be accessed by an enabled device,\nconfigured to select digital objects whose\nspatial attributes correspond with the de-\nvice\u2019s current location. While the \u201ctrue\u201d\nlocation of the content is a database, by\nmaking it possible to access that content\nin a particular position\u2014and only in that\nposition\u2014its place migrates into the\nphysical environment. Whether the user\nis authoring or only accessing content,\nthe metaphor remains: The person be-\ncomes a kind of \u201ccursor\u201d navigating dig-\nital media located in the world.\nLocated Media. Geo-annotation has\ngenerated widespread interest for use in\nalistic representations of a town or ter-\nrain but outline images of animals, sym-\nbols and words, shifting the focus from\nrealism or documentation to figurative\ndrawing. One example is what Wood \ndescribes as \u201cthe world\u2019s biggest IF,\u201d\nstretching from the south coast of En-\ngland to East Anglia\u2014an outline draw-\ning of the word IF created by positional\ndata generated during a journey across\nthe country and then superimposed over\na satellite photograph of the U.K.\nThe Karosta images illustrate a vi-\nsual aesthetic common to many such \nGPS projects, where expression emerges\nbetween the cartographic contours in \nthe intricate abstract shapes produced\nthrough this mapping technique. Some\ninvolve a secondary mapping of error,\nplotting the accuracy of each GPS read-\ning as the diameter of a circle, generat-\ning aleatory tracings that expose the limit\nof the technical system (Fig. 1) [7].\nArtists have explored this aesthetic in a\nvariety of ways, such as the use of rope\nand string in the Distance Made Good\ngallery-based installations by Jen Hamil-\nton and Jen Southern (Canada\/U.K.).\nIn projects where mapping and track-\ning techniques are applied in an art con-\ntext, the participants tend to have a\ndifferent relationship to the data or arti-\nfacts produced than would otherwise be\nthe case, and this often takes on a per-\nformative aspect. A number of locative\nart projects involve performance or per-\nformers, such as Myriorama, by Ambi-\nentTV.NET (U.K.), and Choreography of\nEveryday Movement, by Teri Rueb (U.S.A.).\nMany more feature some element of per-\nformance by non-performers, whether\nthis be the filmmaker Pete Gomes draw-\ning in chalk outside the ICA in London\nor the participants in Fujihata\u2019s Field-\nWorks pirouetting playfully while mak-\ning impromptu sketches. What is of note\nhere is the way in which awareness that\nmovement is being recorded or mapped,\n350 Hemment, Locative Arts\nU\nR\nB\nAN\nIT\nY \nAN\nD\n L\nO\nC\nAT\nIV\nE \nM\nED\nIA\nFig. 1.

Here\nit is used as a means of documentation\nand of augmenting the environment with\nadditional information that elaborates or\nexplains something already present. It \nis another means of delivering informa-\ntion, a new way of experiencing other-\nwise conventional media content in the\nenvironment.\nGraffiti, Narrative, Gaming. Geograf-\nfiti (Canada\/U.K.) and GeoNotes (Swe-\nden) seek not to document or interpret\nthe environment, but instead to embel-\nlish it with digital graffiti or virtual tag-\nging as expressive mark. The same basic\nprinciple is at play in InterUrban (U.S.A.),\nbut in this case, multiple, interconnected\ndigital contents create an ambient \nnarrative, experienced via movement\nthrough an urban space and encounters\nwith narrative elements designed to\nmake sense in any sequence (Fig. 2).\nLikewise Uncle Roy All Around You, by Blast\nTheory and the Mixed Reality Lab (U.K.),\ncombines ambient narrative with perva-\nsive game play.\nSocial Authoring. In a number of proj-\nects the focus is on opening up a so-\ncial space by enabling people to produce\ntheir own content within such an envi-\nronment. (area)code (U.K.) and [murmur]\n(Canada) enable people to author and\naccess stories, poems or anecdotes about\na particular place via a mobile phone us-\ning SMS (short-message service) or voice\nmail, respectively, not by using digital po-\nsitioning technology but simply by ad-\nvertising an access number on posters\nlocated in designated sites. Yellow Arrow\n(U.S.A.) adopts a similar low-tech ap-\nproach, but in this case uses stickers so\nthat participants, rather than the project\ncreators, can choose where the digital ob-\nject is placed as well as its content, en-\nabling it to work on a much larger scale\nwithout ties to any one particular site. Ur-\nban Tapestries (U.K.) and Mobile Bristol\n(U.K.) are more complex locative au-\nthoring platforms. They have been the\nfocus of social experimentation that ex-\nplores how multiple layers or threads \nof meaning may be woven or inserted\nwithin the environment in a form of \ncollaborative authoring characterized by\nmultiplication, as well as localization, of\nperspective. In these kinds of projects it\nstarts to become possible for users to en-\ngage with the database rather than just\nwith individual contents.\nAmbulant\nMany locative projects dispense with\nscreen-based representation or gallery\nother, community wireless and media at\na park bench. They each exploit the dis-\ncontinuity between urban space and the\ninvisible layer of media floating above it\nto juxtapose incongruous actions or be-\nhavior. The intersection of the digital and\nthe geographic brings into proximity dif-\nferent kinds of incommensurable space.\nThe engineering challenge of vertical\nhandover, moving seamlessly between\nwireless networks of varying resolution\nand latency, finds an analogue in negoti-\nating seams between overlapping and dis-\ncontinuous social milieu. This affords an\nopportunity to intervene and to play. In-\nstead of interpreting or embellishing a lo-\ncation, projects such as Radio Ballet and\nPark Bench TV present something that \nis more relational, attempting not to re-\nsolve the discontinuities but to hold them\nopen, enabling us to stand momentarily\noutside the everyday. Here locative art is\nnot to do with simple representation, nor\nplacement of digital objects nor simply\nmoving about. It is instead an interven-\ntion that is simultaneously spatial and\nsocial.\nDECONSTRUCTING THE GRID:\nDIS-LOCATIVE ARTS\nLocative art\u2019s focus on networking, au-\nthoring and accessing creative content\nwithin the environment offers the chance\nto take art out of the galleries and off the\nscreen. This hope needs to be tempered\nby an awareness that, in place of the rich-\nness of embodied experience of the\nworld, many projects offer the challenge\nof roaming the environment while squint-\ning at a tiny screen and clunky menu, sep-\narated from the world by a barrier of bad\nusability. What is more, some locative\nprojects may be \u201cof the world\u201d but are not\n\u201cin the world\u201d: their final form is on-line\nor gallery based, rather than experienced\nvia mobile devices or \u201cold media\u201d such as\nstickers.\nIn an important sense, this is a false dis-\ntinction, however. First, even if the final\nform is screen-based, the process through\nwhich the work is produced is com-\nmonly located within the rural or urban\nenvironment, typically in the form of\nworkshops involving a small number of\npractitioners. More importantly, to the\nextent that the focus is on the dynamic\nrelation between data space (or data-\nbase) and world, it is incidental where the\nfinal representation is sited.\nThe nature of this relationship be-\ntween database and world is of greater\nconsequence than simply the question \nof whether the project is sited \u201cin the\npresentation as the primary site of the\nwork and instead involve walking and\nmoving about. Where the focus is on me-\ndiated experience specific to a certain lo-\ncation or locations, this category is likely\nto be a natural companion or correlate\nof geo-annotation projects, rather than\nan option exclusive of them.\nInterpretive, Explanatory. Some proj-\nects involve a journey that is informative,\nresponding to and illustrating features \nof the natural or human-made environ-\nment. Here the media is about that place,\ndescribing or elaborating it. The simplest\ncases involve following a path, such as in\na heritage trail, where the user is guided\nin their journey by, say, an audio mono-\nlogue. Otherwise, a project may enable\nusers to find their own path through a set\nof predetermined possibilities, moving\nthrough an area that has been mapped\nout and encountering interactive media\nthat correspond to certain locations or\nobjects.\nExpressive, Generative. Here the jour-\nney is creative and expressive. Audio or\nvideo walks, of the kind Janet Cardiff \nhas been creating since the early 1990s,\nentail a more esoteric encounter with \nmedia objects and environment. An am-\nbulant action that engages in computa-\ntion is .walk, by Wilfried Houjebek (the\nNetherlands), which uses simple com-\nmands (in an analogue of computer\ncode) to prompt a series of movements\nby participants, who follow algorith-\nmic patterns around the city and who \nalter those algorithms and paths by ex-\nchanging numerical data with the other\nparticipants they encounter. .walk is gen-\nerative in the sense that the consistent\napplication of a simple algorithm con-\ntinually shuffles the movements of par-\nticipants with open and unpredictable\nresults. In creating an intimate and direct\nrelationship between bodies and code, \nit also shifts the focus from mapping \nor visualization to performativity\u2014en-\nabling normally hidden operations to \nbe not only brought into view but also\nperformed:\n\/\/ Classic.walk\nRepeat\n{\n1 st street left\n2 nd street right\n2 nd street left\n}\nSocial, Relational. Radio Ballet (Ger-\nmany) and Park Bench TV (U.K.) in-\nvolve interventions in which participants\nare invited to use public space in a non-\nobvious way, one involving a flash mob\u2013\ncum\u2013ballet in a train station (Fig. 3); the\nHemment, Locative Arts 351\nU\nR\nB\nAN\nIT\nY \nAN\nD\n L\nO\nC\nAT\nIV\nE \nM\nED\nIA\nworld,\u201d on-line or in a museum or gallery.\nOne issue that quickly becomes apparent\nis the reliance in locative arts on the clin-\nical precision of digital tracking and the\nemphasis on point-to-point correspon-\ndence [9]. Projects that draw not only on\ncartographic tools but also on metaphors\nof mapping tend to aim for a one-to-\none correspondence between world and\nimage, between the movements of par-\nticipants and their screen-based repre-\nsentation. Likewise many geo-annotation\nprojects seek a determinate placing or \nfixing of position, wherein location is \nunambiguously designated or assigned.\nIn most cases ambiguity\u2014or disruption\nof mechanical precision\u2014arises only in\nthe negotiation of land features and the\nresolution or granularity of technical\nhardware.\nFurthermore, locative media often \nassumes a reductive understanding of\nspatiality. It encounters the fabric of\nspace-time via an abstract coordinate sys-\ntem, betraying its indebtedness to car-\ntography and GIS, in which location is\nreduced to a set of geographic coordi-\nnates or a wireless cell. In this respect the\nparallel between locative art and the work\nof Richard Long gains further resonance\nwith the intervention of Bill Drummond,\nin which he drew x\/y coordinates on one\nof Long\u2019s photographs before cutting out\nthe pieces one by one. These pieces are\nnow circulating in the hands of a thou-\nsand new collectors. Locative media\u2019s\nunderstanding of location often seems to\nshare more in common with that of\nDrummond than of Long, its transcen-\ndent frame of reference and Cartesian\nspace much like the grid marked by\nsions of the project, a subversion of the\nCartesian grid was effected by represent-\ning the physical terrain as a function of\nthe speed at which it is encountered; in\none iteration the shape of Mount Fuji be-\ncame distorted, the same slope shown to\nbe longer when going up than when go-\ning down.\nIn Choreography of Everyday Movement,\nTeri Rueb (U.S.A.) works with classically\ntrained dancers to explore the poetics \nof the urban body, as well as the distance\nbetween the world and its representa-\ntion. It too incorporates GPS traces in the \nfinal gallery-based representation, but\nhere they are inscribed in sheets of Per-\nspex, which are then layered to create \na kind of Rorschach image. The longi-\ntude\/latitude coordinates are deliber-\nately removed\u2014\u201cThe performer is only\nvisible as an ant-like dot crawling across\nthe screen. Movement and physical pres-\nence are reduced to the most basic ab-\nstraction\u201d [11]. Here we are reminded of\nLev Manovich\u2019s identification of radar as\nthat which epitomizes the use of linear\nperspective to map and identify objects\nand spaces: \u201cRadar is the best example of\nthe rationalization of sight in the twenti-\neth century. . . . [A] radar operator sees a\nscreen, a dark field with a few bright\nspots. Here the function of visual nomi-\nnalism . . . is isolated and abstracted\u201d [12].\nJust as radar can be said to clarify and\ncondense the function of modern visual\nsurveillance technologies, so Rueb takes\nthe real-time abstraction of movement to\nan extreme at which its limit is revealed,\nthe cartographic function left bare. Cho-\nreography illustrates how\u2014as a data-\nbased form\u2014locative art brings the \ncoordinate system itself into the frame \nas the material upon which it works.\nAchieving a similar effect from a very\ndifferent approach is Location, Location,\nLocation (2004), by Pete Gomes (U.K.).\nThis saw Gomes walking and drawing\nwithin a 1-km-square area in London, tak-\ning GPS readings and annotating the ur-\nban environment in chalk. In some cases\nGomes drew numerical readings of posi-\ntion or time at sites where he encoun-\ntered objects or events; in other cases\nchalk lines following longitude or lati-\ntude were drawn on, and in some cases\neven through, buildings. This project,\nand related works by Gomes such as SE8\nv1.0 (2004), inscribes the cartographic\ngrid on the city, making an idealized\nCartesian space manifest. It does so, how-\never, only to then reassert the transient,\nmaterial and everyday. The drawings are\ntemporary, quickly washed away by rain.\nIn the impossibility of continuing a true\nDrummond on Long\u2019s photograph [10].\nLocative art\u2019s condition of possibility is a\nprior abstraction, and as a consequence\nits emphasis on location is accompanied\nby a distancing from embodiment, phys-\nicality and context, which\u2014within such\na reductive understanding of spatiality\u2014\nbecome a mere residue of the coordinate\nsystem.\nOne project that moves us toward an\nengagement in the perspectival and em-\nbodied is also in many ways the direct pre-\ncursor to locative art. From its initiation\nin 1992, through its many contemporary\niterations, Masaki Fujihata\u2019s Field-Works\n(Color Plate E) shows how nuance and\nhidden depth can emerge through the\ncreative use of a technology designed to\nimpose a rigid cartographic grid upon\nthe world, going beyond simple docu-\nmentation to open a rich space of con-\ntextual and aesthetic meaning. Through\na juxtaposition of location data captured\nby GPS and moving images captured by\nvideo, it aims to articulate local narra-\ntives, while also excavating a sense of par-\nallelism in the universe on a human scale.\nField-Works stretches and pulls at the co-\nordinate system, in the same way that\ndancers play with shifting the body\u2019s cen-\nter of gravity to create a kind of distortion\nin the fabric of space-time. This is firstly\nachieved simply by introducing multi-\nple viewpoints, and secondly by using \na camera-mounted gyroscope to trans-\nlate even the intimate movements of the\nphysical gaze as a part of the resulting\nwork, the video frame\u2014viewed moving\nalong a GPS trace\u2014shaking and turn-\ning to correspond to unsteady motion of \nthe camera during filming.

(Photo \u00a9 Eiko Grimberg)\ngrid line at street level, the project high-\nlights the opacity of bricks, mortar and\nlived space. Moreover, in the way it is\nexperienced by an audience moving\nthrough the city, it foregrounds not the\nomnipresent perspective of satellites cir-\ncling overhead but a partial and in-\ncomplete perspective at ground level,\nbringing cartography down to earth [13].\nOther projects shift the focus away\nfrom positioning toward proximity and\nrelationality. In Hlemmur in C, by Pall\nThayer (Iceland), two taxis equipped\nwith GPS and their base at the Hlemmur\nbus terminal in Reykjavik are each rep-\nresented with a middle C note. While the\nsound attributed to the base remains con-\nstant, the pitch associated with the taxis\nvaries according to their distance from\nthe base, creating instability in the tone.\nThis piece also involves a visual mapping\ncomponent, but is most interesting in the\nway in which proximity is registered as dy-\nnamic tension in the sound, a strange and\ndisconcerting auditory space.\nSound Mapping, by Iain Mott, is an \ninstallation in which participants realize\na composition by wheeling four move-\nment-sensitive suitcases within a public\nplace (Fig. 4). Four of the cases contain\nodometers measuring wheel rotation in\nboth directions as well as two gyroscopes\nmeasuring tilt and azimuth, and they are\nlinked by data radio transmitters to a fifth\ncase equipped with GPS. While much\nwork with GPS is limited by its low res-\nolution\u2014the nuance of embodied ex-\nperience exchanged for a blunt on\/off\nswitch every few meters\u2014Sound Mapping\nproduces music in response to nearby ar-\nchitectural features, subtle movements\nlar trajectory in locative media generally,\nidentified by Ben Russell among others,\nfrom the spatial to the social [14]. And it\nmay be situated alongside a broader blur-\nring of the distinction between art and\nthe social today, which marks a departure\nfrom conventional understandings of the\nplace of the artist in Western culture and\nin particular the post-Enlightenment un-\nderstanding of the artist as apart from\nsociety.\nAn emphasis on the social is likewise\nfound in Nicolas Bourriaud\u2019s under-\nstanding of relational art: \u201can art taking \nas its theoretical horizon the realm of\nhuman interactions and its social con-\ntext, rather than the assertion of an in-\ndependent and private symbolic space\u201d\n[15]. The kind of relationality involved\nin projects such as Hlemmur in C and Body\nMapping is primarily geometric and spa-\ntial. Another kind of \u201crelationality\u201d arises\nthrough the overlapping of different\nkinds of mapping\u2014geographical maps,\nsocial network maps, node maps, etc.\nSomething a little closer to Bourriaud\u2019s\nunderstanding may be seen in locative-\nart projects that explicitly engage an \naudience in a social space or process.\nThey tend to offer something different\nfrom the gallery-centric, white-cube so-\nciality proposed by Bourriaud, for where\nrelational-art projects tend to be staged\nand exceptional, locative arts are more\noften implicated in the everyday, even if\nonly in their willingness to address non-\nart contexts.\nPark Bench TV, by Gomes, involved a\npark bench with free Wi-Fi access, plus a\nchat forum and local TV channel to\nwhich anyone with a wireless-enabled lap-\ntop had access. The bench served as a\nphysical metaphor for the wireless node\nand a focal point for local content, but it\nalso brought users into physical prox-\nimity and\u2014through the layering or co-\nincidence of different types of location\n(inner-city park, bench, Internet chat\nroom)\u2014produced an uncertain and in-\ncongruous social space [16]. This project\nalso prefigures a wider trend toward free\nnetworks becoming portals to a local\nenvironment or community\u2014as cham-\npioned by the collective \u00eele Sans Fil in\nMontreal, for example\u2014rather than just\naccess points to an undifferentiated band-\nwidth. In another project, Life: A User\u2019s\nManual, Michelle Teran walks the streets\nequipped with a scanner and a moni-\ntor\u2014in one iteration wheeling them\nalong in a shopping cart\u2014picking up\nfeeds from closed-circuit TV cameras she\npasses, which are visible on her mobile\nscreen. Her solitary intervention serves\nand gestures, and the absolute and rela-\ntive movements of the participants.\nBiomapping, by Christian Nold (U.K.),\nmeasures galvanic skin response\u2014using\na customized device of the kind used in\nlie-detector tests, combined with GPS\u2014\nto record anxiety and stress levels of par-\nticipants as they move through the city.\nHere the body is brought into the equa-\ntion only to be abstracted and left be-\nhind. Nold works with readings plotted\nonto a map in the same way other proj-\nects record a visual trace of movement,\nthe composite images mirroring the way\nAmsterdam RealTime reveals the idiosyn-\ncrasy of how urban space is used. There\nis a reverse movement in the way that\npeople respond to readings\u2014their own\nor those of previous participants\u2014this\nshaping their movement through the\ncity. From the perspective of the user\nroaming the city, it prizes open a space\nbetween the physical environment, net-\nworks and the body and offers a different\nway of encountering the city, where the\nlow-cost, DIY aesthetic of the Biomapping\ndevice becomes more significant than the\naccuracy of its representation of physio-\nlogical data.\nOTHER GEOMETRIES: \nRELATIONAL AND SOCIAL\nOne trajectory that may be discerned\nwithin locative arts\u2014implicit in the tax-\nonomy above\u2014runs from realism and\ndocumentation (conventional maps, city\nguides) to expression (digital graffiti, am-\nbient narrative) to the collaborative and\nsocial (collaborative maps, social author-\ning). In broad terms this mirrors a simi-\nHemment, Locative Arts 353\nU\nR\nB\nAN\nIT\nY \nAN\nD\n L\nO\nC\nAT\nIV\nE \nM\nED\nIA\nFig. 4. Iain Mott, Sound Mapping, Linz, 1998.

Radio Ballet, de-\nscribed by the group as an \u201cexercise in\nunnecessary loitering,\u201d involves a chore-\nographed and orchestrated performance\nguided by audio broadcast over a free net-\nwork. It creates a happening or event at\nvariance with the everyday, functional use\nof space, and in so doing brings the so-\ncial norms that govern our use of public\nspace into view. These projects offer a\nview of locative art as something more\nthan spatial representation. Indeed, they\nfall outside a narrow definition of lo-\ncative art or locative media. And yet they\nillustrate how spaces that are both so-\ncial and other can be opened at the in-\nterface of communication, location and\nthe body.\nWhereas \u201cmixed reality\u201d posits the vir-\ntual and physical as layered or intersect-\ning, these projects suggest that something\nelse can be produced in between. In \nlocative-media projects we find a fold be-\ntween virtual and physical, data space and\ngeographical space. In some cases, such\nas Houjebek\u2019s generative walk or Gomes\u2019s\npark bench, these folds do not just mix\nrealities but produce a reality of their\nown. They might in this sense be said to\nbe counter-sites and\u2014like Foucault\u2019s \u201chet-\nerotopias,\u201d or \u201cother\u201d places\u2014to place all\nother sites into question [17]. This might\nbe metaphoric as much as literal. We\nmight, for example, ask how the intensity\nof luminescence in Amsterdam RealTime\nor the trace of embodiment in Biomap-\nping might be said to constitute a het-\nerotopic image, an image of an other\nplace, rather than a representation of \nthe real. Likewise, we might ask of geo-\nannotation projects how they open an\n\u201cother\u201d space, which is not the same as\nproviding more sophisticated interpre-\ntive tools.\nThe straightforward geo-annotation \nof space\u2014placing data in geographical\nspace\u2014can be seen as an instance of\nwhat Deleuze and Guattari have termed\nemplacement, which they distinguish from\nhaecceities, or \u201cconcrete individuations\nthat have a status of their own and direct\nthe metamorphosis of things and sub-\njects\u201d [18]. These have the kind of indi-\nviduality we find in seasons or dates, as\nopposed to subjects or things, and \u201ccon-\nsist entirely of relations of movement and\nrest between molecules or particles, ca-\npacities to affect and be affected\u201d [19].\nWhen locative media hides behind the\nconsole of positioning systems, an ab-\nture RICX, 2004) pp. 175\u2013177.
