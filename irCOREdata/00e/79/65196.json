In contrast, research on students\u2018 learning and in particular their \nmisconceptions about science topics has been publicised widely. Most science \nteachers have heard of misconceptions, but almost none know about PCK: the \nauthor used the term with a group of experienced chemistry teachers, to horrified and \nexcited calls for further explanation \u2013 was this something they had missed? What \nwas it exactly? Could I please repeat the name? Where could they find out more? \nThe lack of attention may, as Abell (2007) notes, be that PCK research seeks a \nuniting paradigm under which to undertake \u2015normal science\u2016. In.Kuhnian terms, the \nfield is still at the \u2015pre-science\u2016 stage, so despite having occupied significant research \ntime for over twenty years, is not ready for wider dissemination.  \n \nThis review attempts to move the discussion forward by using extant research to \narrive at an overall picture of PCK that may be useful for science teachers and their \neducators. The paper will examine how PCK has been interpreted within science \neducation, offering suggestions for making more of the concept to aid development of \nhigh quality science teachers.  \n \nWhy is pedagogical content knowledge research in science education \nimportant?  \n \nInternational debate about how best to prepare high quality science teachers is on-\ngoing. Some organisations assume \u2016knowing more science\u2016 makes someone a \n\u2015better\u2016 science teacher. For example, the UK\u2018s Royal Society of Chemistry argues:-  \n \n\u2015The best teachers are those who have specialist subject knowledge and a real \npassion and enthusiasm for the subject they teach\u2026. The Royal Society of \nChemistry believes that young people deserve to be taught the sciences by \nsubject specialists\u2016 (RSC, 2004, quoted in Kind, 2008)  \n \nSimilarly, a lobbying group, CaSE, the Campaign for Science and Engineering in the \nUK argues:-  \n \n\u2015Children need to be taught by specialist [science] teachers. Teachers\u2018 \nqualifications predict teaching quality and are the second greatest predictor of \nperformance in physics after pupil ability\u2016 (CaSE Opinion Forum, May 2007)   \n \nAlthough many successful science teachers are academically well-qualified in their \nspecialist subjects, possession of a good Bachelor\u2018s degree in a science subject is \nnot a de facto guarantee that someone will teach that subject effectively. A recent \nreport from England\u2018s Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) points to the fact \nthat successful teaching, as measured by the numbers of 5 \u2013 16 year olds achieving \nspecific levels on the science National Curriculum, barely changed between 2005 \nand 2007. The report observes:-   \n \n\u2015Given the extensive subject knowledge of most secondary science teachers \nmuch teaching paid scant regard to what and how pupils were learning. In many \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 3 \nlessons, teachers simply passed on information without any expectation of \npupils\u2018 direct engagement in the process. The objective appeared to be to get \nnotes into books, then leave the learning to the pupils.\u2016  (Ofsted, 2008, p 17) \n \nPresumably at least some of these science teachers were \u2015subject specialists\u2016 \u2013 but \nclearly were not teaching in ways that actively aided students\u2018 learning. Teachers\u2018 \ncontent (subject matter) knowledge is only part of the story: possession of good \nteaching skills is also needed. PCK represents the knowledge teachers use in the \nprocess of teaching. If we can identify this, our understanding of what \u2015good science \nteaching\u2016 looks like and how to develop this more consistently will be enhanced. \nBucat (2005) comments:  \n \n\u2015There is a vast difference between knowing about a topic (content \nknowledge) and knowledge about the teaching and learning of that topic \n(pedagogical content knowledge)\u2026.\u2016 \n \nTo date, a reasonably well-agreed claim arising from research is that PCK provides a \ntheoretical framework for examining and understanding teachers\u2018 skills (Abell, 2008). \nDespite this, inconsistencies and disagreements persist about PCK, meaning there is \nno overriding consensus about how this can best describe successful science \nteaching.  \n \nEducation researchers seized on PCK as a means of enhancing both teachers\u2018 \nprofessional status and the process of educating them. Although there is wide \nagreement that PCK is a useful construct, finding out exactly what it comprises and \nusing this knowledge to devise good practice in teacher education is not easy. PCK \nis tacit, or hidden knowledge: when preparing lessons, for example, teachers think \npragmatically, \u2015I am preparing a lesson\u2016 not, \u2015I am using my PCK\u2016. PCK is not (yet) \nan explicit \u2015tool\u2016 used consciously by teachers. Investigating PCK requires \nresearchers to understand processes underlying lesson preparation, and an analysis \nof how and why a teacher teaches as s\/he does. PCK is, therefore, both elusive and \nattractive. Accordingly, the review examines ways in which researchers have \nelucidated PCK in different teaching situations. A reasonable expectation from this is \nto gain a deeper understanding of how PCK develops. How does a novice science \nteacher become expert? Describing characteristics of both novices and experts, or \nexperienced teachers is relatively easy, but if PCK is to be useful in science teacher \neducation we need an understanding of how teachers develop. Significant research \neffort has been devoted to investigating PCK among pre-service (trainee) teachers, \nsome of which is reviewed here.  PCK, as explained below, is claimed as only one \ntype of teacher knowledge, and involves transforming knowledge for students\u2018 benefit. \nHence, PCK does not stand alone in a teacher\u2018s repertoire: SMK has already been \nmentioned as a critical component. The relationship between SMK and PCK is \nexamined in this review.  \n \nSince the 1970s, science education has argued for academically well-qualified \nscientists to be trained as teachers, but despite succeeding on this point in many \ncountries, unevenness in the quality of teaching practice remains. This paper argues \nthat understanding how science teachers\u2018 pedagogical practices develop, knowing \nhow to \u2015measure\u2016 and represent these and establishing what constitutes \u2015effective\u2016 \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 4 \npedagogy for teaching science will contribute to our overall understanding of what \nhigh quality science teaching looks like. Specifically, such knowledge will:-  \n help to make explicit what science teachers actually do when teaching \nscience;  \n indicate how teaching approaches relate to students\u2018 learning;  \n contribute to evidence that subject matter knowledge alone does not \nmake a high quality science teacher; \n ensure that teacher educators are well-informed about the PCK of \n\u2015expert\u2016 or experienced science teachers that can in turn, inform the \ntraining of novices.  \n \nThe expectation is that gaining better overall understanding of science teachers\u2018 PCK, \nits development and the relationship between PCK and SMK  will help establish \nscience teaching practice of consistently higher quality.  \n \nThe origins of pedagogical content knowledge  \n \nPedagogical content knowledge (PCK) originated as one of seven categories of \n\u2015teacher knowledge\u2016 proposed by Lee Shulman (1986a, b; 1987).  In making his \nproposal, Shulman was participating in a US-centred debate about the status of \nteaching as a profession. At issue was whether school teachers could be regarded \nas \u2015professionals\u2016, aligned with doctors or lawyers, or if they were simply \u2015skilled \nworkers\u2016.  In earlier papers, Shulman (1985, 1986a) highlighted the transition from \nthe1870s, when teacher training was based largely on factual knowledge, to the mid-\n1980s examination of general understanding of educational issues. He raised the \nquestion \u2015Where did the subject matter go?\u2016 (1986, p 11) pointing out that this was \nthe \u2015missing paradigm\u2016 in teacher education. Without this, Shulman argued, \nunderstanding how subject matter was transformed into instruction, and how lesson \ncontent related to students\u2018 knowledge and ideas was impossible. These issues lie at \nthe heart of \u2015teaching\u2016, yet were absent from analysis of teachers\u2018 competences. In \ncontrast, medicine and law were defined by skills, cases and procedures that \ncharacterised practice and on which analysis of doctors\u2018 and lawyers\u2018 competences \ncould be based. To address this \u2015gap\u2016 Shulman (1986b) first proposed three \ncategories of \u2015content knowledge\u2016 for teachers:-  \n \n Subject-matter content knowledge \n Subject-matter pedagogical knowledge  \n Curricular knowledge  (p 13)  \n \nBy subject-matter content knowledge, Shulman meant the \u2015amount and organisation \nof knowledge per se in the mind of the teacher\u2016 (op cit). Taking a biology teacher as \nan example, Shulman argued that this teacher\u2018s knowledge of the subject may \nreasonably be expected to be equal to that of a non-teacher or \u2015lay\u2016 biologist. \nShulman defined subject-matter pedagogical knowledge as \u2015the ways of representing \nand formulating the subject that make it comprehensible to others\u2016 (op cit), that is, \nthe analogies, illustrations, examples, explanations and ideas that a teacher uses in \nlessons. The third category, \u2015curricular knowledge\u2016 equates to a doctor\u2018s knowledge \nof current techniques and\/or treatments to relieve an illness: in teaching terms, \ncurrent materials include textbooks, software, laboratory demonstrations and other \nephemera available to use in the classroom. Shulman went on to argue that:- \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 5 \n \n \u2015an understanding of both content and process are needed by teaching \nprofessionals\u2026 within the content we must include knowledge of the structures \nof one\u2018s subject, pedagogical knowledge of the general and specific topics of \nthe domain and specialised curricular knowledge.\u2016 (op cit, p 43)  \n \nIn his 1987 paper, Shulman refined his three categories into a more comprehensive \nlist of seven, here quoted in full so PCK can be seen in its original context (italics \nadded)-  \n \n\u2015- content knowledge;  \n- general pedagogical knowledge, with special reference to those broad \nprinciples and strategies of classroom management and organisation that \nappear to transcend subject matter; \n- curriculum knowledge, with particular grasp of the materials and programs that \nserve as \u2015tools of the trade\u2016 for teachers;  \n - pedagogical content knowledge, that special amalgam of content and \npedagogy that is uniquely the province of teachers, their own special form of \nprofessional understanding; \n- knowledge of learners and their characteristics; \n- knowledge of educational contexts, ranging from the workings of the group or \nclassroom, the governance and financing of school districts, to the character of \ncommunities and cultures; and \n- knowledge of educational ends, purposes, and values, and their philosophical \nand historical grounds.\u2016 (p 8)  \n \nShulman identifies PCK as distinctive of teachers\u2018 practice, worthy of special \nattention as a unique feature of their work.  Other professions, such as law and \nmedicine, have their own \u2015curricular\u2016 knowledge, for example \u2013 in law, this comprises \nknowledge about cases, statutes and procedures; in medicine, knowledge of \nanatomy, physiology, biochemistry as well as pharmacology, medical and surgical \nprocedures. Law and medicine also have their equivalent of \u2015learners\u2016 \u2013 clients  \nneeding advice, or patients requiring attention. Shulman argues that although the \nother knowledge types have their equivalents in different fields, PCK remains unique \nto teachers. In PCK, content and pedagogy are blended - the teacher combines his \nor her understanding about a topic with instructional strategies and additional \nknowledge to promote student learning. Shulman describes PCK as:-  \n \n\u2015\u2026the capacity of a teacher to transform the content knowledge he or she \npossesses into forms that are pedagogically powerful and yet adaptive to the \nvariations in ability and background presented by the students.\u2016 (1987, p15) \n \nTeacher educators received Shulman\u2018s proposals enthusiastically. Subsequently, \nresearch effort has attempted to establish these categories of teacher knowledge as \nan all-embracing paradigm for teacher education. However, although aspects of \nShulman\u2018s general views are widely accepted, many models of PCK have been \nproposed, as researchers have interpreted Shulman\u2018s ideas differently.  \n \n \nOrganisation and scope of the review  \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 6 \n \nThe review is organised in four sections. First, a variety of models of PCK are \nconsidered. This sets the scene by showing ways in which Shulman\u2018s proposals \nhave been interpreted by different researchers. The second section, PCK in practice, \ndescribes examples of PCK found in science teachers with different levels of \nexperience. This describes teaching in different settings and the struggles teachers \nexperience in learning to teach. The relationship between PCK and SMK is \nhighlighted as important to understanding this process. Third, the interaction between \nPCK and SMK is explored in greater depth.  Shulman\u2018s view is that SMK is separate \nand transformed using PCK. However, researchers express conflicting views about \nthe extent to which these knowledge base components are separate or merged. The \nvariation of opinion on this leads to fruitful discussion about the nature of PCK itself. \nFinally, research methods for elucidating PCK are considered. These offer insights \ninto effective ways of investigating this largely tacit construct. Some studies use \nmulti\u2014method approaches, others one or two data collection instruments. Together, \nthe material provided offers insights into PCK as a construct to help understand \nscience teachers\u2018 practice and development of teaching skills. In conclusion, \nsuggestions for taking the field forward are offered.  \n \nIn selecting papers, well-known and respected databases such as ERIC and ZETOC \nwere searched for papers dating from 1987, using terms such as \u2015pedagogical \ncontent knowledge science\u2016 and \u2015development of science teacher knowledge\u2016. These \nyielded approximately 500 papers from which selections were made. The review by \nAbell (2007) and Gess-Newsome and Lederman\u2018s (1999) text also provided starting \npoints. Reviewed papers either:-  \n \n discuss a theoretical standpoint on PCK, to inform understanding of models of \nPCK adopted by researchers, and\/or  \n \n report an empirical study investigating PCK in pre-service, novice or \nexperienced science teachers relating specifically to teaching aspects of \nphysics, chemistry or biology, or  \n \n report an empirical study investigating changes in pre-service, novice or \nexperienced science teachers\u2018 PCK, either arising from an intervention \ndesigned by a researcher or through teaching practice  \n \nThe reference list is supplemented with further articles which illuminate or explain \ndetails requiring clarification of material in reviewed papers. In order to fairly \nrepresent the range of work in the field, no criteria relating to the size and scope of \nresearch studies have been applied - some offer an in-depth view of one teacher, \nwhile others present larger scale work using a number of teachers. Work undertaken \nin primary, secondary and tertiary settings is included. The points made arose as a \nresult of reading \u2013 the review has not been contrived to support the author\u2018s pre-\nconceived opinions.  \n \n \nModels of PCK  \n \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 7 \nShulman (1986b, 1987) proposed that PCK comprises two components: the \nknowledge labelled \u2015representations\u2016 but often referred to more frequently (and in \nthis paper from this point) as \u2015instructional strategies\u2016 and knowledge of students\u2018 \nsubject matter \u2015learning difficulties\u2016.  He suggested that teachers use instructional \nstrategies such as illustrations, analogies, explanations and demonstrations to make \nsubject matter comprehensible to their students. \u2015Learning difficulties\u2016 comprises \nknowledge about students\u2018 misconceptions, na\u00efve ideas gained through interpretation \nof prior learning experiences, or preconceived ideas about a topic, as well as \nknowledge of any other potential barriers to learning subject matter, such as how \nconcepts inter-relate and strategies to help solve problems. Researchers have \nmodified Shulman\u2018s original proposals in different ways, summarised in Table 1 \n(based on Lee, Brown, Puthoff, Fletcher and Luft, 2005).  \n \n[INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE] \n \nThe table shows Shulman\u2018s original components shaded grey. The letter \u2015P\u2016 denotes \na component considered part of PCK; \u2015K\u2016 represents knowledge a researcher \nconsiders a component of a teacher\u2018s knowledge base but not part of PCK \u2016; and \u20150\u2016 \nis a component not discussed explicitly in that model.  Eight other models, including \ntwo based on Shulman\u2018s original proposals (Grossman, 1990; Magnusson, Kracjik \nand Borko, 1999) are discussed.  Six differ from Shulman\u2018s original proposal by \nincluding SMK within PCK. Of these, three (Marks, 1990;, Fernandez-Balboa and \nStiehl, 1995; and Koballa, Gr\u00e4ber, Coleman and Kemp,1999) draw on empirical \nresearch findings. These models combine components from Shulman\u2018s list of seven \n(p X) within PCK. Three propose PCK models that use components from Shulman\u2018s \nlist, but develop the concept from theoretical perspectives: Cochran, deRuiter and \nKing (1993) draw on principles from psychology; Veal and MaKinster (1999) place all \nknowledge components into a taxonomy; and Banks, Leach and Moon (2005) \npropose a new component, \u2015school knowledge\u2016, to subsume others. Similarities and \ndifferences between these PCK models are discussed below. Where researchers \ngive different names to components, the alternatives are mentioned.  \n \nModels based on Shulman\u2019s proposals  \nGrossman\u2018s (1990) and Magnusson, Krajcik and Borko\u2018s (1999) models follow \nShulman\u2018s line of thought explicitly, identifying subject matter knowledge (SMK) as a \ndistinct category, and defining PCK as the special knowledge used by a teacher to \ntransform his \/her SMK to benefit students. For example, Magnusson et al comment \nthat they see PCK as: \n \n\u2015the transformation of several types of knowledge for teaching (including subject \nmatter knowledge)\u2026 and \u2026.represents a unique domain of teacher knowledge\u2016 \n(p 85).   \n \nBoth models add purposes (called \u2015orientations\u2016 by Magnusson et al) and curricular \nknowledge. Grossman included this component in PCK after observing differences in \nteaching goals in her empirical study of six teachers teaching English Literature. One \nteacher wanted to ensure students could \u2015make connections between the text and \ntheir own lives\u2016 (Grossman, p 8), while another wanted his students to learn how to \nanalyse and understand a text. Grossman argued that these different goals \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 8 \ninfluenced teachers\u2018 choices of instructional strategies, so contributed to PCK.  She \ndefined \u2015purposes\u2016 as  \n \n\u2015the overarching conceptions of teaching a subject [that] are reflected in \nteachers\u2018 goals for teaching particular subject matter\u2016 (p 8). \n \nMagnusson et al (1999) in devising a model for science teaching, accept Grossman\u2018s \nviews. They note possible \u2015orientations\u2016 for science teaching parallel to the different \npurposes observed by Grossman among teachers of English literature. These \ninclude discovery, conceptual change, process, didactic and inquiry. A teacher \nadopts one or more for different reasons: a \u2015didactic\u2016 orientation may imply fact \ntransmission, while \u2015discovery\u2016 aims that students find out science concepts for \nthemselves. Either will impact on instructional strategies, influencing PCK.  \n \nGrossman and Magnusson et al (op cit) also add curricular knowledge. Grossman \nobserved that English teachers required and utilised \u2015horizontal and vertical\u2016 (p 8) \ncurricula in their teaching, for example, knowing which books were needed when \nteaching a specific age range and using their awareness of books studied in earlier \nand later years. Magnusson et al follow similar reasoning, arguing that curricular \nknowledge \u2015distinguishes the content specialist from the pedagogue \u2013 a hallmark of \npedagogical content knowledge\u2016 (p 103).   \n \nIn adding knowledge about assessment, Magnusson et al follow Tamir (1988), who \ndefined this component as comprising knowledge of the dimensions of science \nlearning that are important to assess and knowledge of the methods by which \nlearning can be assessed. Teachers will plan lessons knowing the science that will \nbe examined, and may adjust their instructional strategies accordingly. Teachers \nmust use assessment methods to find out what students have learned. Recent \nmoves in the UK towards assessment for learning (\u2015AfL\u2016, Black, Harrison, Lee, \nMarshall and Wiliam, 2003) make this integral to teachers\u2018 instructional strategies, \nnot something imposed by external organisations.  \n \nModels based on research evidence that include SMK within PCK  \nOther researchers see PCK differently: Marks (1990), Fernandez-Balboa and Stiehl \n(1995) and Koballa, Gr\u00e4ber, Coleman and Kemp (1999) include SMK in their \ndefinitions of PCK.  Marks (1990) based his PCK model on data collected from eight \nprimary mathematics teachers. He re-names instructional strategies \u2015instructional \nprocesses\u2016 and learning difficulties as \u2015students\u2018 understanding\u2016. Marks adds \u2015media \nfor instruction\u2016, which aligns with Grossman\u2018s curricular knowledge (so is coded \u2015P\u2016 \nin Table 1), to mean knowledge about texts and materials.  Marks\u2018s inclusion of SMK \narises directly from his teachers\u2018 views about subject matter. Their personal \nunderstanding of mathematical concepts was taken for granted. They did not \ndescribe their teaching in terms of transforming mathematical knowledge, but \nemphasised pedagogy, focusing on \u2015justifications\u2016, \u2015important ideas\u2016, \u2015pre-requisite \nknowledge\u2016; and knowledge of \u2015typical school math problems\u2016 (p 5) Marks argues \nthat for this group, SMK and PCK were not clearly distinguished knowledge \ncomponents. In coding this model in Table 1, SMK appears as \u2015P\u2016.  Note also that \nalthough the teachers\u2018 descriptions of their PCK overlap with Grossman\u2018s \u2015purposes\u2016 \ndiscussed above, Marks seems to include this knowledge within SMK, rather than as \na separate component. Hence, \u2015purposes\u2016 is coded \u20150\u2016 for this model.  \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 9 \n \nFern\u00e1ndez-Balboa and Stiehl (1995) found similar evidence to Marks among \nuniversity lecturers, who seemed to roll SMK into their teaching practices when \ndescribing their work. These data led the authors to suggest PCK comprises \nknowledge about subject matter; knowledge about students; instructional strategies; \nthe teaching context and teaching purposes (p 293). The inclusion of context is novel \n\u2013 the authors note that \u2015contextual barriers\u2016 contribute to practices characteristic of \nuniversity teaching, including handling large class sizes, specific time limits, scarcity \nof appropriate resources, students\u2018 attitudes and tenure and promotion issues. \nFern\u00e1ndez-Balboa and Stiehl contend that lecturers\u2018 effectiveness depends on \u2015the \nspecific beliefs and knowledge that guide their decisions and actions\u2016 (p 305), so \ncontext influences PCK.  \n \nKoballa et al (1999) also support inclusion of SMK within PCK. Their study was \nbased on data collected from trainee chemistry teachers preparing to teach 16-19 \nyear olds in German \u2015gymnasium\u2016 schools. They propose a \u2015nested\u2016 (p 276) \nstructure with chemistry knowledge gained from university and school at the centre of \nteachers\u2018 PCK. Koballa et al add general pedagogy, a factor they call \u2015multi-\ndimensional knowledge\u2016 (p 278) to their set of PCK components.   \n \nModels of PCK drawing on theoretical perspectives  \n \nCochran, deRuiter and King (1993) adopt a psychological perspective, believing that \nthe term \u2015knowledge\u2016 in PCK \u2015[is] too static and inconsistent\u2016 (p 266). They adopt \n\u2015knowing\u2016 as a more dynamic word capturing their perceptions that teachers \nconstruct PCK on the basis of understanding students\u2018 needs. Cochran et al describe \nthemselves as \u2015radical constructivists\u2016, arguing that teachers would devise \ninstructional strategies actively, in response to understanding their students:-  \n \n\u2015Increasingly strong PCKg enables teachers to use their understandings to \ncreate teaching strategies for teaching specific content in a discipline in a \nways that enables specific students to construct useful understandings in a \ngiven context\u2016 (p 266). \n \nThese authors suggest that a teacher\u2018s PCK, or \u2015PCKg\u2016 develops with time as s\/he \nbecomes increasingly aware of students\u2018 needs. Rather than being a separate \ncomponent, SMK is an element of PCK, as this is used to help decide how best to \nhandle students in a class.  Their PCK components are student characteristics, \nsubject matter content, pedagogy and the environmental context of learning. They \ndefine \u2015student characteristics\u2016 as \u2015a teacher\u2018s understanding of abilities, learning \nstrategies, ages, development, motivation and prior conceptions of the subject\u2016 (p \n266). This corresponds to Shulman\u2018s \u2015learning difficulties\u2016. Their three other \ncomponents can be found in Shulman\u2018s original list (see above). These authors \nconsider that knowledge of instructional strategies lies outside PCK, on the grounds \nthat Shulman implies these are \u2015pre-learned\u2016 techniques.  \n \nTaking this view, a teacher\u2018s PCKg relies on combining SMK, pedagogical \nknowledge and awareness of the environment in which they work. Cochran et al \nargue a teacher\u2018s environment is influenced by political, social, cultural and physical \nfactors, any or all of which may, in turn, influence PCK. This definition emphasises \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 10 \ngeneral pedagogy, rather than subject-specific representations and strategies. The \nauthors stress that \u2015integration of the four components comprises PCKg\u2016 (p 268), and \nthat teacher education should promote its acquisition by offering simultaneous \nexperience of the four components. \n \nVeal and MaKinster (1999) suggest that PCK should be based on a hierarchical \nstructure they call a \u2015taxonomy\u2016. This: \n \n \u2015attempts to represent a hierarchical process by which prospective secondary \nscience teachers obtain different knowledge bases contributing to their PCK \ndevelopment\u2016 (p 6).  \n \nFour levels of knowledge are presented: general PCK is lowest. This includes an \nunderstanding of pedagogical concepts applicable to a wide range of subjects. Above \nthis come subject-specific PCK strategies (equivalent to Magnusson, Krajcik and \nBorko\u2018s (1999) \u2015orientations\u2016 and Grossman\u2018s (1990) \u2015purposes\u2016). The two highest \nlevels introduce new terms - \u2015domain-specific\u2016 and \u2015topic-specific\u2016 PCK. By \u2015domain-\nspecific\u2016, the authors mean the understanding a teacher has about \u2015how to teach\u2016 a \nspecific area within a subject. For example, a teacher may choose a titration \nexperiment when teaching about moles, volume and concentration in chemistry. \nAbove this comes \u2015topic-specific\u2016 PCK. At this level, the distinction between the \nknowledge of science teachers with different SMK backgrounds comes into play. A \nscience teacher with a physics background may explain a chemical concept \ndifferently from a chemist. A teacher\u2018s knowledge arises from their intellectual \ntraining, is specific to their specialist topic or field and is integrated into their PCK.  \n \nThe hierarchy is proposed from theoretical perspectives \u2013 the authors don\u2018t claim that \nteachers acquire their PCK like this. But the description may be helpful \u2013 components \nof PCK for science teaching may be hierarchical. For example, two teachers, one \nwith SMK in biology and the other in physics may have similar general PCK (the \nlowest level) and, with practice, may acquire similar domain-specific PCK. Their \ndifferent science backgrounds may mean that acquiring similar topic-specific PCK is \nmuch more difficult, relying on intensive input to \u2015overcome\u2016 ingrained ways of \nthinking about scientific ideas.  \n \nThirdly, Banks, Leach and Moon (2005) present a model of teachers\u2018 professional \nknowledge in which \u2015school knowledge\u2016, \u2015subject knowledge\u2016 and \u2015pedagogic \nknowledge\u2016 are linked by a teacher\u2018s \u2015personal subject construct\u2016. In proposing their \nmodel, the authors split PCK into \u2015school knowledge\u2016, an entirely new category, and \n\u2015pedagogic knowledge\u2016. School knowledge describes how subject knowledge is \nadapted for school use \u2013 for example, what can be termed \u2015school science\u2016, the \nrepresentation of the subject delivered in science lessons, differs from \u2015science\u2016 as \npractised by scientists. The authors suggest teachers need to understand the \nhistorical and ideological origins underpinning how their subjects are organised for \nteaching purposes. This category subsumes Shulman\u2018s curricular knowledge. \nPedagogic knowledge comprises the \u2016practices and beliefs that inform teaching and \nlearning\u2016 (p 336), such as knowledge of analogies, illustrations, and explanations \nneeded to teach a topic, as well as an understanding of the relationship between \nschool and subject knowledge.  Thus, school knowledge can be seen as a \u2015bridge\u2016 or \n\u2015intermediary\u2016 (p 336) between subject knowledge and pedagogic knowledge, \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 11 \nfacilitating choice of resources for teaching and understanding of the curriculum and \nhow these influence pedagogic practices. In this structure, subject knowledge \nequates with Shulman\u2018s SMK, while pedagogic knowledge includes an \n\u2015understanding of the crucial relationship between subject knowledge and school \nknowledge\u2016 (p 335 \u2013 336). A teacher\u2018s personal subject construct comprises \nknowledge gained from his\/her learning experiences, opinions about \u2015good\u2016 teaching \nand beliefs about the purposes for the subject. The authors claim Shulman\u2018s theory \npresents a teacher\u2018s knowledge as \u2015a static body of content lodged in the mind of the \nteacher\u2016 (p 333). They also criticise Shulman for adopting a \u2015teacher-centred\u2016 model \nof cognition focusing on a teacher\u2018s skills and knowledge rather than the process of \nlearning. Instead, their model draws on theories of learning suggested by Gardner \n(1983, 1991) and the French concept of \u2015didactic transposition\u2016 (p 334). Gardner\u2018s \n\u2015multiple intelligences\u2016 theory stimulates consideration of learners\u2018 different \nunderstandings, while didactic transposition acknowledges variation and progression \nin the way a teacher develops his\/her practice. The authors argue these principles \noffer a contrast to Shulman\u2018s emphasis on transformation, which implies teachers \nlearn \u2015the\u2016 way to teach a concept in a specific setting.  \n \nModels of PCK: discussion  \n \nShulman\u2018s PCK model has been criticised. For example, Bromme (1995) believes \nShulman defines his components in vague terms, and that the model as a whole \nlacks a theoretical background. This is fair, given that PCK was devised in principle \nbefore any research was undertaken that provided supporting evidence. Since \nShulman made his suggestions, teacher educators have been making up for this \ndeficiency. The models presented above point to Shulman\u2018s views being rather \nsimplistic - one common feature is that all eight proposals add components to \nShulman\u2018s model: researchers seem to agree that PCK is more complex than he \nimplied originally. Bromme (op cit) offers a further criticism that may explain this \nincreased complexity. In defining PCK as \u2015instructional strategies\u2016 and \u2015knowledge of \nstudents\u2018 difficulties\u2016, Shulman does not appear to acknowledge the influence of \nother factors on teaching and learning. The alternative models address this in \ndifferent ways, adding the additional components described. Picking up Bromme\u2018s \npoint about a theoretical background for PCK leads to consideration of the last three \nmodels discussed above. If a choice is to be made between these, Cochran et al (op \ncit) offer the strongest model in theoretical terms, basing their thinking on \nconstructivism. This is likely to resonate with the current generation of science \nteachers, drilled in constructivist principles applied to students\u2018 learning. The notion \nof constructing personal knowledge about \u2015how to teach\u2016 is therefore a relatively \neasy mental step to take.   \n \nShulman\u2018s PCK model is also criticised by various researchers (including Cochran et \nal, 1993 and Banks et al, 2005) as being \u2015static\u2016 \u2013 the implication is that instructional \nstrategies and knowledge of students\u2018 difficulties can be learned as separate entities. \nIn other words, in becoming a teacher, a novice could, for example, attend a course \nentitled \u2015instructional strategies for teaching science\u2016 which would provide all the \ninformation s\/he would need to develop expert skills. This is perhaps reading too \nmuch into Shulman\u2018s statements, which served the purpose of introducing \u2015teacher \nknowledge\u2016 as a general concept and PCK as a component of this. Nevertheless, \nthat teachers\u2018 knowledge can develop over time and change in response to different \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 12 \nschools \/ educational settings, students, resources and curricula is a reasonable \npoint for a model to adopt. By using the more active term \u2015knowing\u2016 rather than \n\u2015knowledge\u2016 Cochran et al (op cit) acknowledge this. Banks et al (op cit) take \n\u2015didactic transposition\u2016 as a more active principle that shapes a teacher\u2018s PCK over \ntime.  \n \nThe issue as to whether SMK and PCK are separate knowledge base components or \nare combined requires further discussion. Of the nine models discussed here, a \nmajority favour combining SMK within PCK. Only three, Shulman\u2018s original proposal \nand two others, use the principle that PCK \u2015transforms\u2016 SMK; six suggest SMK and \nPCK are not separate. The issue of whether SMK and PCK are separate \ncomponents or should be merged is discussed more fully later (p X). For the moment, \nGess-Newsome (1999b) provides a way of discussing PCK models that gives a \nmeans of distinguishing between those that maintain SMK is separate from PCK and \nothers proposing these are merged. She distinguishes between \u2015transformative\u2016 and \n\u2015integrative\u2016 PCK models. An integrative model does not recognise PCK as a \nseparate knowledge component: instead, teacher knowledge as a whole embraces \nSMK, pedagogy and context. Gess-Newsome likens this to a chemical mixture in \nwhich components retain their individual identities, but are indistinguishable on a \nmacroscopic level. Thus, in an integrative model, SMK is part of PCK \u2013 PCK itself \nsummarises a teacher\u2018s knowledge base, so does not \u2015exist\u2016 as a separate type of \nknowledge. A transformative model defines PCK as the transformation of subject \nmatter, pedagogical and contextual knowledge to create new knowledge for the \npurposes of instructing students. The transformative model can be likened to a \nchemical compound, in which elements cannot easily be separated: Gess-Newsome \ndescribes them as being \u2015inextricably combined into a new form of knowledge, PCK\u2016 \n(p 11). In a transformative model, SMK is a separate component, while PCK is a \nunique type of knowledge. A teacher uses his\/her SMK in making PCK.  \n \nModels based on Shulman\u2018s proposals, Grossman (1990) and Magnusson, et al \n(1999) are transformative. These authors suggest combinations of knowledge \ncomponents are used in creating PCK, but that SMK is separate.  A teacher will \npossess SMK and seek to transform this for students\u2018 benefit using his\/her PCK, \nwhich, they propose, combines four (Grossman) or five (Magnusson et al) \ncomponents. Each of these selected components requires subject-specific \nknowledge \u2013 for example, purposes (orientations) and curricula differ for individual \nsubjects. Thus, under these models, the PCK of biology and English teachers differ, \nas the components rely on, for example, instructional strategies appropriate for each \nsubject.  The remaining six models fit Gess-Newsome\u2018s integrative definition. Veal \nand MaKinster\u2018s taxonomy claim all components contribute to PCK except \u2015school \nknowledge\u2016 which is unique to Banks et al (2005).. Three models leave out one or \nmore of Shulman\u2018s original two components: Koballa et al (1999) and Cochran et al \n(1993) remove instructional strategies and add general pedagogy; Banks et al (2005) \nmake different claims based on their own notion of \u2015school knowledge\u2016. Fernandez-\nBalboa and Stiehl (2005) and Marks (1990) retain both of Shulman\u2018s components, \nbut add others. Integrative models tend to include components that reflect more \ngeneral teaching knowledge, recognising the broad range of skills teachers use; \nlessons involve good classroom management, consideration of the learning \nenvironment and other factors, all of which apply equally regardless of subject.  \n \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 13 \nThe relative merits of transformative and integrative models need consideration. Abd \nEl-Khalick (2006), for example, argues that integrative models lack explanatory \npower, as no mechanism is suggested that shows how the interaction between SMK, \npedagogy and contextual factors results in PCK. Banks et al (2005) suggest a \nteacher\u2018s \u2015personal subject construct\u2016, which could be the missing link. This \ncombines experiences from teaching with other factors held by the teacher such as \npurposes and orientations \u2013 a teacher mixes these with subject, pedagogical and \nschool knowledge to create PCK. Transformative models imply a mechanism exists \u2013 \nthis is used to convert SMK to PCK, to use SMK in creating PCK, to adapt SMK for \nschool use and \/or more. A highly skilled teacher will have a way of developing \nhis\/her knowledge. If we can distil such a teacher\u2018s PCK and find out how this \ndevelops, then perhaps this, and\/or hints about the process of gaining it, can be \n\u2015taught\u2016 explicitly to trainee teachers .  \n \nThese two possible models offer suggestions for science teacher education. It could \nbe argued that current methods adopt an \u2015integrative\u2016 approach, without realising \u2013 \nwe offer a mix of individual courses on SMK, pedagogy and contexts but don\u2018t \nexplicitly state what knowledge novices are supposed to construct from these, or \nprovide methods for helping them utilise the information. Perhaps unsurprisingly, \nthen, teachers don\u2018t recognise PCK, or what this means. A \u2015transformative\u2016 approach \nwould make a mechanism explicit, articulating what a novice should do with \nknowledge, offering strategies for combining material from different sources. Before \nmaking judgements on which model may be best suited to science teacher education, \nwe need further information. The next section contributes to this by discussing PCK \nelucidated in a variety of studies.  \n \n \nPCK in practice \n \nNovices and experts  \nNovice, pre-service teachers (\u2015trainees\u2016) face significant challenges: Davis, Petish \nand Smithey (2006) reviewed literature on five areas that science teachers are \nexpected to understand; content and disciplines of science, learners, instruction, \nlearning environments and professionalism. Baird, Brodie, Bevins and Christol (2007) \nsummarise the extensive lists of competences comprising the professional standards \nUK and US teachers must meet in order to be \u2015qualified\u2016. Adams and Krockover \n(1997) analysed concerns and perceptions held by pre-service science and \nmathematics teachers. They found that trainees expressed concerns about lack of \npreparation for teaching, classroom management and organising their time, among \nothers. The authors note that \u2015teachers have a need to not only develop content \nknowledge, but pedagogical content knowledge\u2016 (p 48) in order to better prepare \nthem for working full-time in schools. Anxiety among trainees was also found by de \nJong (2000) in his study of pedagogical content concerns held by a group of pre-\nservice chemistry teachers teaching aspects of chemical bonding. He identified \ntrainees\u2018 lack of self-confidence in their subject matter knowledge; how to make \nabstract concepts accessible for students and understanding of students\u2018 difficulties \nas important aspects of their early attempts at teaching.  \n \nSet against this background are studies of pre-service teachers, whose PCK is \nnaturally limited: contrasts in trainees\u2018 practice and that of \u2015experts\u2016 are claimed by \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 14 \nGeddis, Onslow, Beynon and Oesch (1993) in their study of chemistry teachers \nteaching about isotopes. These authors report two novices who adopt a \n\u2015transmission\u2016 model of teaching, providing scientific explanations, together with \nprinciples for doing the calculations. In contrast, an experienced teacher ensured \nstudents understood the concept, being less concerned about giving scientifically \naccurate information.  His teaching strategies transformed subject knowledge for the \nstudents\u2018 benefit. The authors conclude that teachers require a wide range of \nknowledge types to successfully transform SMK for students, including knowledge of \n\u2015learners\u2018 prior knowledge\u2016, effective teaching strategies taking these into account, a \nvariety of alternative representations and \u2015curricular saliency\u2016 \u2013 awareness of the \nimportance of a topic to the whole curriculum. They suggest novices use SMK as a \nsource of information, adopting a \u2015tabula rasa\u2016 approach to instilling this into students\u2018 \nminds. Experts focus on students\u2018 learning, devising activities that make content \naccessible, their own understanding being implicit to the process.  \n \nTrainees\u2018 attempts at transforming content knowledge have been explored by a \nnumber of researchers, mainly using physics and chemistry concepts as contextual \nsettings. Research based on biology is less frequent, perhaps because as a higher \nproportion of trainees are biology specialists, the assumption among researchers is \nthat they find teaching physics and chemistry topics problematic, prompting initial \ninvestigation of PCK development in these areas. For example, Halim and Meerah \n(2002) studied the PCK utilised for teaching physics concepts by twelve pre-service \nteachers with varied science degree backgrounds. They found that a majority of \ntrainees held misconceptions similar to school students. When teaching, trainees \nrepeated their own misunderstandings; their ability to transform SMK for students \nwas \u2015impeded\u2016 (p 223) by their lack of knowledge. The authors claim that possession \nof good content knowledge is a pre-requisite to developing sound PCK. Van Driel, de \nJong and Verloop (2002) and de Jong and van Driel (2004) draw similar conclusions. \nThey investigated how pre-service chemistry teachers teach topics involving the \nmacro-micro shift \u2013 the relationship between observable phenomena and the \nparticulate nature of matter. Results showed that a university-based workshop and \nhigh quality mentoring helped trainees become more aware of their tendency to jump \nbetween macro and micro levels without considering the impact of this on students. \nThe authors report that PCK developed, in that trainees were more able to consider \nstudents\u2018 needs in preparing teaching strategies after intervention. Sperandeo-Mineo, \nFazio and Tarantino (2006) used the macro-micro shift applied to thermodynamics as \nthe subject context for their PCK development study, also finding that pre-service \nteachers show the same learning difficulties and \u2015representations\u2016 as school students. \nThey suggest that knowledge transformation \u2015is not a one-way process\u2016, that is, from \nSMK directly to PCK. They suggest a two-way process, pointing out that SMK differs \nbetween teachers, as will learners\u2018 interpretations of what is presented to them. \nHence, successful knowledge transformation depends on teachers having a \u2015deep \nknowledge of \u2026 physics\u2026as well as an awareness of the pupils\u2018 spontaneous \nmodels in the different content areas\u2016 (p 238).  \n \nTrainee teachers\u2018 PCK in primary (elementary school) science has been investigated \nby a number of workers. For example, Jones, Carter and Rua (1999) investigated the \nrole played by children\u2018s science concepts in developing trainee teachers\u2018 \npedagogical practices for sound, light and electricity teaching. They devised an \nintervention combining trainees\u2018 exploration of their own conceptual understandings \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 15 \nwith those of children. By comparing pre- and post-intervention concept maps, \nresearchers claim that trainees\u2018 understanding developed, and awareness of \nchildren\u2018s misconceptions helped their teaching move towards transformation rather \nthan transmission of knowledge.  Warren and Ogonowski (1998) studied PCK \ndevelopment through observing a primary school teacher in her second year of \nteaching, using aquatic ecology as the context. The paper describes in detail how the \nteacher, not a biologist, grappled with new content knowledge at the same time as \nteaching it. The authors comment that in this example, the teacher\u2018s ideas and \nexperiences combined with scientific ideas and practices to create learning \nopportunities for the children. Davis (2003) presents a descriptive study of one pre-\nservice primary teacher\u2018s efforts to teach light. She found that at times, even when \nthe teacher understood the science content, her instruction was flawed, suggesting \nthat although good SMK is important, it is not an automatic precursor for good PCK. \nConcurring with other work discussed here, Davis points out that trainees with poor \nSMK may struggle to explain science concepts appropriately.  \n \nRelatively few investigations have explored PCK among pre-service or experienced \nteachers working at post-16 or tertiary levels. One such is Koballa, Gr\u00e4ber, Coleman \nand Kemp (1999), who investigated the knowledge base perceived by nine pre-\nservice chemistry teachers as necessary for teaching in academic, post-16 schools in \nGermany. Three types of knowledge were identified \u2013 university chemistry \nknowledge, school chemistry knowledge and knowledge about teaching, which \nincluded knowledge about how students learn. None of the nine trainees mentioned \nall three types \u2013 and the authors point out that PCK was not mentioned explicitly. In a \nstudy based in teaching in a university chemistry laboratory, Wood-Robinson (2005) \ninvestigated the skills used by graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) working with \nundergraduates. As her focus was on the skills required to teach specific chemical \nknowledge, she modified PCK to \u2015PChK\u2016, meaning \u2015pedagogical chemical \nknowledge\u2016, classifying this into four categories or \u2015levels\u2016 from basic interaction with \nstudents (PChK 0) to teaching chemical concepts (PChK 3). Wood-Robinson found \nthat relatively few GTAs worked at the higher levels, highlighting difficulties they \nexperience in transforming abstract chemical concepts for understanding.  \n \nSimmons, Emory, Carter, Coker, Finnegan et al (1999) show that teachers are aware \nof good teaching skills , but may lack the ability to implement these. They carried out \na longitudinal study investigating how the knowledge, beliefs and practices of science \nand mathematics teachers alter during their first three years in the classroom. Their \ndata, gathered from nine different universities, indicate that about 40% of teachers in \ntheir first year of teaching think they teach from a student-centred perspective, taking \nstudents\u2018 prior knowledge and misconceptions into account, while in fact their \npractices indicate they adopt the \u2015novice\u2016 style described by Geddis et al (1993) \ndiscussed above. Further, the study showed that teachers\u2018 perceptions of their \npractices change markedly during the early years of their classroom experiences, \nsuggesting that several years must pass before PCK is fully developed. Instabilities \nin pre-service teachers\u2018 thinking about their subject matter and pedagogical \nknowledge were also found by Lederman, Gess-Newsome and Latz (1994). They \nreport that the act of teaching prompted changes in trainees\u2018 perceptions of the \nstructure of their specialist subjects, moving towards integration of pedagogical and \nsubject matter \u2013 after teaching practice, they tended to consider making concepts \nrelevant and taking students\u2018 learning needs into account. These occurred alongside \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 16 \ndevelopment of increasingly complex representations of pedagogy among the \nparticipants, reflecting greater emphasis on child-centred approaches, and \nawareness of a wider range of roles for a teacher, including \u2015counsellor\u2016 and \u2015friend\u2016. \n \nHowever, classroom exposure is no guarantee to creation of an \u2015expert\u2016 science \nteacher: Tobin and Garnett (1988) compare four experienced teachers - two primary \nscience and two chemistry specialists. The primary science teachers were \nenthusiastic about science and handled classroom management issues competently, \nbut despite years of experience lacked the science knowledge needed to teach \nconcepts well. The authors note that this was not the case with the chemistry \nspecialists, whose background knowledge combined with transformation skills to \ncreate good learning environments.  \n \nDeveloping science teachers\u2019 PCK  \nResearch has investigated how science teachers\u2018 PCK develops.  Veal (1999) and \nVeal, Tippins and Bell (1998) monitored PCK using a series of content-specific \nvignettes, among other methods. They found that PCK developed over time, with \ntrainees reporting classroom experience as the most important influential factor. \nThese authors suggest that PCK development is complex, occurs in phases and \nrelates to trainees\u2018 abilities to integrate knowledge from a variety of sources. \nPossession of content knowledge is identified as essential to PCK development.  \nSome of their findings concur with those reported earlier (de Jong, et al, 1994; \nSperandeo-Mineo et al, 2006; Lederman et al, 1994). Veal (1999) adds a different \nangle, stating that teachers:-   \n \n\u2015\u2026ground their development of a knowledge base in their existing beliefs. This \nultimately effects how they teach in the classroom.\u2016 (p 36)  \n \nThese beliefs relate to how they were taught; how abstract or \u2015magical\u2016 they believed \na particular concept or event to be; or their personal misconceptions. Veal notes that \nto develop PCK, changes to these often deep-seated beliefs were required.  \n \nA Taiwanese case-study of three pre-service chemistry teachers during their one \nyear teacher education course (Tuan, Jeng, Whang and Kaou, 1995) traced factors \ninfluencing the development of their PCK. These teachers held hierarchical subject \nmatter structures based on their school education. This shifted to making more \nconnections with other disciplines and to everyday life towards the end of the training \ncourse. Initially, teachers\u2018 PCK was primitive, relying on repetition of information. \nLater on, some integration between SMK, students\u2018 needs and instructional \nstrategies began to occur. The authors note that trainees\u2018 willingness to improve and \nreflect were significant factors in making progress.  \n \nAngell, Ryder and Scott (2005) used a questionnaire comprising eight items relating \nto different content areas in physics to compare the PCK of novice and expert \nphysics teachers. They report little difference in the content knowledge of novice and \nexpert teachers, but found experts made more extensive connections between \nknowledge in different contexts and exhibited a rich set of pedagogical skills, while \nbeginners focused on transmitting content. The authors note the contribution made \nby teachers\u2018 values and attitudes to pupils\u2018 learning.  \n \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 17 \nThese studies indicate that teachers\u2018 values and beliefs influence good PCK \ndevelopment. The extent to which novices are able to take in and reflect on feedback \nseems to contribute to their development as teachers, with significant changes \noccurring as trainees\u2018 practices alter in response. Lederman, Gess-Newsome and \nLatz (1994) tracked the development and changes in the structures of subject matter \nand pedagogical content knowledge held by twelve trainee science teachers in the \nUS. Both sets of structures appeared unstable, and highly likely to change as \ntrainees experienced teaching.  \n \nStudies reporting the impact of interventions comprising activities designed to help \ndevelop teaching skills include Clermont, Krajcik and Borko (1993). They showed \nthat a two-week workshop impacted positively on skills of teachers who were novices \nat carrying out chemical demonstrations.  Specifically, the authors claim that the \nworkshop helped extend teachers\u2018 repertoires for representing chemical concepts, \nand were more able to distinguish between effective and ineffective demonstrations. \nJusti and van Driel (2005) analyse changes in five teachers\u2018 PCK relating to using \nmodels and modelling prompted by participation in a specially devised course and \ncompletion of a research project on the topic. They found a variety of responses \u2013 \nfrom one teacher who was able to use material garnered from the intervention to \nallow her students to express their ideas, to another who blamed lack of success on \ndeveloping students\u2018 thinking on the students themselves. The authors make a \nnumber of comments about how their work might influence teacher education, \nincluding that analysis of new experiences and reflection on personal development \nare critical to the success of an intervention.  \n \nStudies based on interventions located in training and school settings are also found. \nKind and Wallace (2008) analyse the impact of experienced teacher-led sessions \nspecifically designed to help develop trainees\u2018 PCK for teaching a range of science \ntopics to 11-14s. The intended emphasis on PCK was not identified by a majority of \nthe 80 trainees, most of whom used the sessions as opportunities to learn content \nknowledge, not PCK. Among a sub-group of six who were observed teaching, only \none explained a \u2015difficult\u2016 science idea correctly, while the other five tended to avoid \nexplaining concepts by opting for a basic level description, instead thinking pupils \nwere learning because they behaved well and completed their allotted tasks. Burn, \nChilds and McNicholl (2007) observed interactions between teachers in a school \nscience department, noting how expertise was shared through collaborative \ndiscussions in informal settings. The authors note that trainee and newly-qualified \nteachers benefited from an environment in which ideas could be shared and \nconcepts explained freely. This enabled them to access expert teachers\u2018 PCK in an \natmosphere of trust, care and mutual respect, without feeling a sense of failure. \nWilson (2005) describes an intervention based on providing trainee science teachers \nwith a framework for planning lessons to help develop a \u2015language\u2016 describing how \nchildren learn. Her evidence indicates the tool aided trainees\u2018 articulation of personal \nbeliefs about learning, prompting use of a wider range of strategies and better \nunderstanding of students\u2018 conceptual difficulties.  \n \nThe role of collaboration in developing PCK features in Daehler and Shinohara \n(2001), who used a series of \u2015science teaching cases\u2016 \u2013 similar  to Veal\u2018s (1999) \nvignettes \u2013 in a study with primary teachers. The cases focused on electricity and \nmagnetism concepts and data were collected through using these to stimulate \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 18 \nteachers\u2018 group discussions about them. Thus, teachers worked collaboratively to \nmake sense of the concepts and to consider how best to teach them. The authors \nfound that teachers\u2018 content knowledge was an important factor \u2013 teachers often \nbegan discussing how to teach the concepts while not clearly understanding the \nconcepts themselves. Where discussions were \u2015highly interwoven\u2016 between content \nand how to teach, these seemed to be most fruitful in terms of PCK.   \n \nPCK in practice: discussion  \n \nThese and other studies offer confirmation that PCK exists, that novices are not \u2015born\u2016 \nwith PCK, and acquire a bank of skills and new knowledge in becoming professional \nscience teachers. The process of transition to expert is lengthy and success is not \nguaranteed \u2013 Tobin and Garnett (1988), for example, found that experienced, \u2015time-\nserved\u2016 teachers are not necessarily experts. Clues about creating effective science \nteachers can be gleaned from these papers.  \nAs a starting point, the studies reviewed here suggest three common factors \ncontribute to development. First, possession of good SMK is regarded as a pre-\nrequisite (Veal, 1999; Daehler and Shinohara, 2001; van Driel et al, 2002; Halim and \nMeerah, 2002; de Jong and van Driel, 2004). SMK confers a good basis from which \nto develop: at a pragmatic level, one reason for becoming a teacher cited by many \nnew entrants is the attraction of communicating their favourite subject to others. \nWhere SMK is found to be weak, or in some way deficient, novice and experienced \nteachers\u2018 PCK benefits from interventions or other activities to facilitate changes \n(Sperandeo-Mineo, et al 2006; Jones, et al, 1999; Clermont et al, 1993). Second, \nclassroom experience is crucial \u2013 studies (for example, Simmons et al, 1999; Geddis \net al, 1993; Lederman et al, 1994) point to significant changes occurring in the early \nmonths and years of working as a teacher. In particular, trainees\u2018 perceptions of \nscience alter considerably, moving from thinking of science as a subject which they \nlearned at a high level to realising how the subject is interpreted for school contexts. \nTrainees learn to adapt their knowledge, taking learners\u2018 needs into account \n(Lederman et al, op cit; Tuan et al, 1995; Angell et al, 2005). Third, emotional \nattributes seem to play a part in making a successful transition to \u2015teacher\u2016 (Adams \nand Krockover, 1997; de Jong, 2000; Burn, et al, 2007). Good levels of personal self-\nconfidence and provision of supportive working atmospheres in which collaboration is \nencouraged benefit novices and experienced teachers alike. These may play a role \nin helping a teacher change deep-seated beliefs that Veal (1999) suggests may \nimpact on practice.   \n \nSome papers discussed above offer insight as to whether transformative or \nintegrative models of PCK represent teachers\u2018 knowledge (p  ). Geddis, et al (1993), \nde Jong  (2000), Halim and Meerah (2002) and Sperandeo-Mineo et al (2006) refer \nexplicitly to \u2015transformation\u2016 of SMK, for example in \u2015making abstract concepts \nexplicit\u2016 (de Jong,op cit) or addressing trainees\u2018 misconceptions in physics (Halim \nand Meerah, op cit). These adopt a transformative model. Warren and Ogonowski, \n(1998) and Daehler and Shinohara (2001) imply that PCK is integrative in nature. \nTheir studies do not refer explicitly to transformation of SMK, noting that a \ncombination or inter-weaving of knowledge from different sources constitutes PCK. \nThe studies with transformative orientations tend to indicate that a mechanism, as yet \nunspecified, is involved in PCK development. Two use interventions, such as probing \nand enhancing awareness of misconceptions (Halim and Meerah, op cit) or \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 19 \nworkshops focusing on teaching an abstract concept (van Driel et al, 2002) to prompt \nPCK development. The implication here is that input targeted on specific aspects of \nscience gives teachers the chance to consider their own thinking carefully, leading to \nchanges in practice.  In contrast, the two studies identified as taking an integrative-\ntype stance explore PCK with teachers who have completed initial training, rather \nthan complete novices new to the profession. This leads to the possibility that a \nmechanism of some kind may be involved in developing PCK in the very first stages \nof becoming a teacher \u2013 one factor or component at this critical point may involve \nmental adaptation of science knowledge for classroom use. Evidence for this is \nprovided by Gess-Newsome (1999a), who reports a biology specialist training for \nteaching saying:-  \n \n\u2015\u2026I\u2018m a biology major. I took all the required course work for my degree and \ndid quite well. But no one has ever explained to me what it is that I am \nexpected to teach about biology\u2026\u2016 (p 51)  \n \nThis trainee distinguishes between SMK learned during her degree and SMK \nrequired for teaching. In making the transition to \u2015teacher\u2016, SMK needs to alter from \npure \u2015knowledge about science\u2016 as an academic subject to include \u2015knowledge about \nschool science\u2016, recognising that \u2015science\u2016 and \u2015school science\u2016 are different (Kind \nand Taber, 2004). Applying this to a PCK model suggests that SMK may be used \ndifferently and develop different characteristics as a teacher gains experience \u2013 SMK \nmay be more difficult to distinguish as a separate component within his\/her whole \nknowledge base in the PCK of an experienced, effective teacher, leading to an \nintegrative picture.  Appleton (2005) suggests that integrative and transformative \nPCK may be used at different times by the same teacher, depending on classroom \nevents. Thus, there may be places for both transformative and integrative PCK \nmodels in the overall picture.  So far, though, this is conjecture - we simply don\u2018t have \nsufficient evidence to support this proposal.  The next section adds perspectives by \nexamining the relationship between PCK and SMK more closely.  \n \n \nThe relationship between PCK and SMK \n \nAlthough there is broad consensus that SMK impacts on classroom practice, \nresearchers disagree about the extent to which SMK and PCK should be regarded as \nseparate categories of teacher knowledge. The variation falls into three broad \ncategories: studies treating PCK and SMK as separate components; work suggesting \nSMK and PCK are not entirely separate, but are not completely combined either \n(referred to here as \u2015blurred boundary\u2016 studies); and research that perceives no \ndifference between PCK and SMK.  Besides adding to our understanding of ways in \nwhich PCK is perceived by various researchers, the discussion will provide further \nevidence to help resolve the issue of a suitable model for PCK useful for science \nteacher education.  \n \nSMK and PCK are separate components  \n \nSanders, Borko and Lockard (1993) found contrasts in the PCK used by three \nexperienced science teachers when teaching within and outside their subject \nspecialisms. For example, when planning within specialism, the teachers knew \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 20 \n\u2015\u2026how to build the content by presenting key concepts in a logical sequence\u2016; \u2015\u2026 \nhow much content to present at a certain time\u2016; and \u2015the interrelationships of various \nparts of the subject matter\u2016 (p 729).  They also knew that SMK had to be transformed \nfor the students. When planning outside specialism, the teachers: \u2015had difficulty \ndetermining how much to present at a given time\u2016; \u2015how to sequence presentations\u2016; \nand \u2015how different aspects of the content fitted together\u2016 (p 730). They demonstrated \nuncertainty in teaching, changing plans at the last minute. Overall, the authors \nsuggest that when teaching outside specialism, these \u2015experts\u2016 reverted to \u2015novices\u2016 \nin some respects of their practices, using general pedagogical expertise to keep their \nclasses intact. The teachers learned unfamiliar content alongside the students, as \nwell as learning how to teach it. Their weaknesses in SMK thus impacted on their \nclassroom practice.  \n \nChilds and McNicholl (2007) probed the same issue as Sanders et al (1993) by \nanalysing the discourse used by a single science teacher teaching within and outside \nspecialism. In some respects, they report similar findings \u2013 that when the teacher \nwas secure in her SMK, she could explain the science concept she was teaching \nmore fully and accurately, resorting less often to simplistic dialogue based on \ninteraction-response-feedback. When teaching topics in which she expressed less \nconfidence in her SMK, students were forced to learn by factual recall and \ninformation from experiments \u2013 the teacher did not explain the concept clearly and \ndialogue focused on mainly procedural matters.   \n \nGess-Newsome and Lederman (1995) report the perceptions of subject matter \nknowledge (in their terms, \u2015subject matter structure\u2016) of five American biology \nteachers with between 7-26 years of teaching experience. They found that the level \nof content knowledge was fragmented, comprising \u2015concepts held together only by \nelusive threads\u2016, continuing to question \u2015the ability shown by these teachers to \nsuccessfully present biology as a conceptually integrated whole\u2026\u2016 (p 317). Thus, the \nteachers\u2018 knowledge \u2015had a significant impact on how content was taught\u2016 (p 317). \nTeachers made more connections and integrated a wider range of knowledge, such \nas links to the \u2015real\u2016 world and science, technology and society issues when teaching \naspects of the subject in which they claimed significant expertise. They also found \nthat whole-class instruction tended to be preferred when teachers\u2018 confidence was \nhigh, while small-group or individual work dominated when they were less confident \nin the topic (p 317).   \n \nKind (2008) compared trainees\u2018 perceptions of their teaching within and outside \nspecialism topics. She found that in the initial stages at least, perceived possession \nof good SMK can generate over-confidence resulting in poorer quality within \nspecialism lessons compared to outside specialism lessons. Kind\u2018s data suggests \nthat some trainees find they know too much about their specialist science, and \nexperience conflict in sorting out information needed for teaching effectively. This \ncould be evidence that these trainees have not yet interpreted their science \nknowledge for school use (p  ). Outside specialism teaching presents fewer \ndifficulties, as trainees learn alongside their students and use a richer range of \nresources, including experienced teachers, to develop and teach their lessons. \nPicking up the emotional attributes point raised earlier (p X) Kind also reports finding \na \u2015super-confident\u2016 sub-group, often mature entrants to the profession, characterised \nby their quick realisation that ensuring students\u2018 learning takes place is key to \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 21 \nsuccess. These trainees latch on to providing appropriate activities, and do not worry \nwhether or not their academic SMK on the topic will withstand public scrutiny.   \n \nStudies suggesting the boundary between SMK and PCK is blurred  \n \nAmong workers perceiving that SMK and PCK are not fully distinct categories of \nknowledge, in which the boundary between the two categories of knowledge appears \n\u2015blurred\u2016, or indistinct are Ball (2000) and Deng (2007). Ball begins her theoretical \npaper stating:-  \n \n\u2015Subject matter and pedagogy have been peculiarly and persistently divided in \nthe conceptualisation and curriculum of teacher education and learning to teach\u2016 \n(p 241).  \n \nShe notes that teachers are expected to meet the challenge of integrating SMK and \nPCK themselves, a process which the studies discussed above (Sanders, et al, 1993; \nGess-Newsome and Lederman, 1995; Kind, 2008, etc) show is fraught with \ndifficulties. Ball presents three problems that, if solved, would enable teachers to \nbridge the gap more successfully. First, she argues, the content knowledge required \nfor teaching must be identified, taking what teachers do and the role played by SMK \nin their work into account. SMK must be viewed from the learners\u2018 perspective: what \nthey know; their difficulties; what textbooks are appropriate, and so on. This is \nsupported by empirical evidence - the novices cited (p  X) by Geddis, et al (1993) had \nnot taken learners\u2018 needs into account. They contrast with the \u2015super-confident\u2016 \ntrainees found by Kind (2008), described on p  X. Second, Ball challenges the \nassumption that \u2015someone who knows content for himself or herself is able to use \nthat knowledge in teaching\u2016 (p 245). Providing more opportunities to study \nmathematics, science or history will not make better teachers, but indicating what \nsort of SMK is needed and how to make use of this may help. Finally, Ball argues \nthat creating opportunities for helping teachers learn how to make use of the SMK \nrequired for teaching must be provided.  \n \nDeng (2007) suggests that helping teachers learn the SMK required by a school \nscience subject instead of the academic discipline behind it \u2015lies at the heart\u2016 of \nteachers\u2018 specialised SMK (p 503). He challenges researchers who hold that science \nteachers transform knowledge of their academic discipline, posing the question \u2015Why \nare academic disciplines being used as a basis for theorizing about teachers\u2018 \nspecialised subject-matter knowledge?\u2016 (p 507) En route to an answer, Deng \npresents data that illustrate differences between the key ideas in academic- and \nschool-physics by observing two experienced physics teachers at work. He \nconcludes that school and academic physics differ in logical, social, psychological \nand epistemological aspects (p 518), but concepts in school-physics:-  \n \n\u2015\u2026 can be viewed as a simplified, qualitative, and transformed version of their \ncounterparts in the academic discipline; they complement or substitute, but not \ncontradict, their disciplinary counterparts\u2016 (p 519)   \n \nHe concludes that school-SMK needs to be presented as an \u2015essential framework\u2016 \nand that secondary science teaching relies more on a teacher understanding a \nsubject from a school-based than an academic perspective (p 527). This argument \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 22 \nthus challenges the assumption, raised also by Kind and Wallace (2008, p X) that \npossession of a high quality degree in a science subject is essential for teaching.  \n \n \nPCK and SMK are not distinct knowledge components \n  \nMcEwan and Bull (1991) dissolve the PCK: SMK boundary entirely, arguing:- \n \n \u2015\u2026 no formal difference exists between SMK and PCK. To the degree that it is \naddressed to particular audiences, all subject matter is pedagogic.\u2016 (p 331)  \n \nThese authors thus reject Shulman\u2018s position that SMK and PCK are separate types \nof knowledge, believing that teaching and scholarship are mutually influential. \nArguing from a theoretical standpoint, they investigate whether teachers\u2018 SMK is \ndifferent \u2015in kind\u2016 (p 316) from that of scholars. McEwan and Bull state:- \n \n\u2015The task of the scholar is to represent the truth; that of the teacher is to \nmake that privileged representation accessible to ordinary mortals by \ntranslating it \u2026. Scholarly knowledge represents the world; pedagogical \ncontent knowledge represents the scholar\u2018s representation to the rest of \nus\u2016 (p 320).  \n \nIn making assertions, they argue, scholars must take into account whether these can \nbe understood by others, and hence in creating an academic discipline have to \nconsider ways in which they can make their discoveries comprehensible. Thus \n\u2015teaching\u2016 is implicit in the process of \u2015doing science\u2016 \u2013 as there is no point putting \nforward proposals, theories and hypotheses or carrying  out experiments if they \ncannot first be understood and then verified by others. In some respects, McEwan \nand Bull appear to elevate scholarly work but play down teaching, claiming:-  \n \n\u2015The teacher\u2018s task could be compared to a\u2026 party game where one player \nknows the answer but cannot say what it is. Instead [s\/he] must provide \nexperiences that will lead others to the answer.\u2016 (p 329)  \n \nHowever, an overlap with Deng (2007) presents here, in that the authors do not \nascribe transformation of academic SMK to teachers, but only SMK relating to \u2015the \nworld in which students act\u2016 (p 329). Support for McEwan and Bull\u2018s position comes \nfrom Segall (2004) whose paper presents additional theoretical evidence that teacher \neducation would be improved by helping trainees to recognise that all SMK is \ninherently pedagogical in nature (p 489). In some respects, Segall\u2018s proposal would \nhelp address the gap expressed by the trainee quoted earlier (p X). Teacher \neducation courses should make explicit \u2015[among the] \u2018things\u2018 teachers should know in \norder to make effective instruction is the instructional nature of knowledge\u2016 (p 501).  \n \nThe relationship between PCK and SMK: discussion  \n \nEvidence presented in this section supports the points made earlier (p X), that SMK, \nclassroom experience and sound emotional attributes contribute to developing \neffective PCK. Sanders, Borko and Lockard (1993), Childs and McNicholl (2007), and \nGess-Newsome and Lederman (1995) indicate that possession of specific, specialist \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 23 \nSMK background imparts confidence to teachers as they approach within specialism \nteaching, providing a basis from which to plan and interact with students. \nGood SMK confers a sense of security, which supports a teacher in devising \nappropriate PCK. Where good SMK is absent, teachers resort to more passive and \nless active instructional strategies, and show less understanding of students\u2018 learning \ndifficulties related to the science. The role classroom experience plays in the \nSMK\/PCK intersection is interesting \u2013 comparing Kind (2008) and Sanders et al (op \ncit)  indicates that pre-service teachers may be more willing to learn PCK for outside \nspecialism teaching than experienced teachers. A teacher with well-established, \ngood PCK relating to one specialist subject experiences uncertainty and hesitation \nwhen faced with teaching new, unfamiliar subjects.  A pre-service teacher with no \nprior PCK on which to draw is more open to developing PCK across science \nspecialist subjects. PCK for outside specialism teaching may be easier to develop \ninitially, as s\/he is in the process of interpreting academic SMK for school purposes \n(p ). Emotional attributes such as confidence are referred to by several researchers \n(Sanders, et al, op cit; Kind, op cit; Childs and McNicholl, op cit). Failure to adapt \nSMK for teaching purposes may mean specialist subject lessons do not go according \nto plan. This may lower confidence and impact negatively on teacher development. \nOver-confidence in SMK can also generate poor quality lessons, perhaps of the type \nOfsted describe (p  ).  A teacher may be absorbed by the process of declaiming his \n\/her knowledge, rather than presenting this appropriately for students\u2018 benefit. The \nconfidence of an experienced teacher may be vulnerable when faced with the \nprospect of teaching an unfamiliar science topic, resulting in reversion to novice \npractices.  \n \nThe papers discussed in this section also contribute to the integrative \/transformative \ndebate (p  ). McEwan and Bull\u2018s (1990) stance is integrative, but is somewhat \nextreme. In practice, their argument means that possession of a science degree \nequates to sufficient mastery of the subject for teaching. This may be true up to a \npoint \u2013 many secondary science teachers seem to have sufficient knowledge about \nscience gained from their academic studies to teach successfully, although some \nadjustments may be required for teaching the full range of science topics. Appleton \n(2005) points to SMK weaknesses persisting among elementary teachers, whose \nbackgrounds may not lie in science \u2013 these teachers often need to learn science in \norder to teach it.  However, in terms of developing PCK, McEwan and Bull (op cit) \nimply it doesn\u2018t matter what teacher education courses include, as a science \ngraduate should be able to teach the subject successfully without further training. \nThis position undermines teacher education and the profession of teaching, so must \nbe disregarded. This is not to say that all integrative PCK models should be \ndisregarded, but supports Abd El-Khalick\u2018s (2006) view that such models can lack \nexplanatory power for teacher development.    \n \nInevitably, in regarding SMK and PCK as separate knowledge components, Sanders \net al (op cit); Childs and McNicholl (op cit) and Gess-Newsome and Lederman (op cit) \ntake transformative stances. Both studies indicate that instructional strategies were \ninfluenced by teachers\u2018 SMK \u2013 where this was lacking, teachers resorted to passive \nstrategies, whereas when their SMK was well-developed, greater confidence in \nengaging students with more active strategies was in evidence. Contrasting McEwan \nand Bull (op cit) with these studies illustrates the more general pedagogical nature of \nintegrative models compared to transformative ones. In making their claim, McEwan \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 24 \nand Bull rely on teachers developing skills by relying on classroom experience alone, \na process which engages a teacher in gaining many types of general pedagogical \nknowledge simultaneously. Studies taking a transformative stance focus on specific \nsubject-basedissues relating to science teaching, discussing precise strategies and \nmaking these explicit. These projects give strong indications that some mental \nprocessing, or mechanism, must be occurring as trainees develop their PCK for \nteaching science.   \n \nHowever, it remains unclear whether or not SMK is part of PCK.  Deng (2007), cited \nabove as a \u2015blurred boundary\u2016 study, offers a way forward, acknowledging that \ndifferences exist between the academic disciplines of science and \u2015school science\u2016 \nby creating \u2015academic-SMK\u2016 and \u2015school-SMK\u2016. We can see this notion featuring in \ndifferent ways in some of the PCK models discussed earlier (p X- X). For example, \nBanks et al (2005) points to \u2015school knowledge\u2016 as an essential PCK component that \nbridges the gap between subject knowledge and pedagogic knowledge. The \n\u2015personal subject construct\u2016 these authors suggest underpins all teachers\u2018 PCK \nincludes elements based on past learning experiences, beliefs and knowledge about \ntheir subject. Veal and MaKinster (1999) distinguish between \u2015domain\u2016-specific PCK \ndescribing \u2015how to teach a topic\u2016 and \u2015topic\u2016-specific PCK (p  X) which recognises the \nrole academic training plays in shaping a teacher\u2018s knowledge base.   \n \nBefore returning to these issues in the concluding section, the emphasis changes to \nmethods used to elicit PCK. These are of interest, as these indicate ways in which \nresearchers have adapted a range of methodologies and developed new techniques.   \n \n \nEliciting PCK  \n \nAs indicated earlier and from the above discussion, an impressive range of studies \nhas investigated PCK. The complexity of teachers\u2018 practice has resulted in \nresearchers devising many different methods to report science PCK, some standard \nand others novel.  Attempts at classification have proved problematic, as inevitably \noverlap occurs with studies falling into more than one category.  Having tried several \nclassification systems, this paper discusses research methods in two groups - \nstudies exploring PCK in situ and those using standardised \u2015prompts\u2016 as elicitation \ntasks.  This produces the clearest set of categories and fewest number of double \nclassifications. In situ studies, investigating how teachers teach science in classroom \n\/ laboratory settings, are more frequent. These are sub-divided into those drawing on \nestablished methodologies in social science research and those featuring novel \n\u2015rubrics\u2016 designed for PCK research. \u2015Prompt\u2016 studies are also sub-divided into two \ntypes: those using probes to investigate the PCK teachers perceive in video excerpts \nor lesson transcripts for example; and those investigating changes to PCK following \nor during an intervention, such as attendance at a workshop or training course. \n\u2015Prompt\u2016 studies can be found as an integral component of some larger, multi-\nmethod in situ projects.   \n \nTo expand the range of papers discussed overall, the studies mentioned here have \nnot been referred to elsewhere in the paper.   \n \n\u201cin situ\u201d studies using established data collection methods   \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 25 \n \nThe projects discussed below use data collection methods based on established, \nstandard practice in social science research (see for example, Cohen, Manion, \nMorrison, REF). These studies tend to collect data over an extended period of time, \nrather than representing a PCK captured at an instant.  \n \nA good, relatively recent example is De Jong and van Driel (2005). This project took \nplace over a one year teacher education course. The paper reports the results of \ninterview data gathered from trainees teaching aspects of chemistry featuring the \nmacro-micro shift (the ability to visualise matter and chemical reactions in terms of \ntiny, \u2015micro\u2016 particles rather than as undivided, \u2015macro\u2016 substances with physical \ncharacteristics such as colour, smell, etc). Participants prepared and taught lessons \non a topic of their choice, such as \u2015dissolving and precipitation\u2016 and \u2015conservation of \nmass\u2016. Pre-lesson interviews focused on the planning process; in post-lesson \ninterviews trainees reflected on teaching and learning. Data indicate that the process \nof teaching inevitably enhanced trainees\u2018 awareness of difficulties associated with \nteaching abstract concepts; pre-lesson interviews showed little awareness of \npotential pitfalls, a finding the authors attribute to trainees\u2018 SMK \u2013 as experienced \nchemists, they switched between macro- and micro-representations of matter \nautomatically.  \n \nTuan et al (1995) preceded de Jong and van Driel (2005) in a similar type of study. \nThey collected pre- and post-lesson interview data from trainee chemists at intervals \nduring their teacher education course. These researchers also interviewed trainees \nabout their knowledge of chemistry and views about teaching, besides using a range \nof methods to probe PCK as this developed. These authors report that trainees\u2018 \nunderpinning conceptual structures of chemistry initially featured chemical content \nalone, with pedagogy regarded separately. As trainees gained teaching experience, \nthe interviews revealed structures that more closely integrated pedagogy with \nchemical knowledge.  \n \nIn a smaller scale piece of work, Veal, Tippins and Bell (1999) used multiple-methods \nincluding a \u2015probe\u2016-type study (see below), to investigate the PCK of two trainee \nscience teachers. Besides the use of probes, their data collection methods \ncomprised: interviews with the trainees, experienced teachers in their placement \nschools and a teacher educator responsible for delivering training sessions; \ndocument analysis; observation notes and reflective journals compiled by the \ntrainees themselves. The findings concur with other researchers indicating that \nclassroom experience, possession of good SMK and knowledge of students\u2018 needs \ncontribute to sound PCK development.  \n \nStudies like these generate rich evidence bases that reveal PCK used in the specific \ncontexts in which the data were collected. The use of multiple methods means that \ntriangulation of data is possible, as interviews, classroom observations and \nquestionnaire answers can be examined for common patterns and corroborations, so \ndata generally have high reliability. A limitation is that many projects of this type tend \nto use trainee teachers, as these represent captive participant groups with low \nresistance and usually high motivation to co-operate, especially if their university \ntutors are directing the research. Collecting data using multiple methods is highly \nlabour intensive \u2013 hence such projects are harder to complete on a large scale with \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 26 \nexperienced teachers in disparate schools, compared to trainees located in a \nfocused training environment. Nevertheless, these studies help to build a picture of \nthe kinds of knowledge that science teachers use, most often in the early stages of \nteacher development when PCK is limited and\/or emerging. Certainly common \nfactors emerge regardless of context \u2013 the points made above (p X SMK, experience, \netc) appear consistently.   \n \nIn situ studies using novel  \u201crubrics\u201d for data collection  \n \nTo date, novel methods for elucidating PCK centre on devising \u2015rubrics\u2016 to tabulate \nteachers\u2018 thinking about their work. Two contrasting examples are discussed.  \n \nFirst, Loughran, Mulhall and Berry (2004; see also Mulhall, Berry and Loughran, \n2003) have devised \u2015Content Representations\u2016 (CoRes) and Pedagogical and \nProfessional experience Repertoires (PaP-eRs) to record teachers\u2018 PCK and to make \nthis explicit.  A CoRe is a detailed description tabulating the \u2015big ideas\u2016 or concepts \nrelating to a topic being taught against points such as what exactly students have to \nlearn about each big idea; their possible difficulties with each concept; why its \nimportant for them to know these concepts; how these concepts fit in with others; and \nany knowledge the teacher holds that connects the big ideas in this CoRe to others. \nA PaP-eR is a narrative document, written in a teacher\u2018s voice, annotated by a \nresearcher. The PaP-eR highlights the teacher\u2018s SMK, showing how s\/he is thinking \nabout teaching this to students.  The CoRe is presented to a teacher as a blank table \nfor completion. To supplement the written information, further data may be collected \nthrough lesson observation and\/or interview. In their book, Loughran, Berry and \nMulhall (2006) provide examples of CoRes and PaP-eRs generated by teachers for \nchemical reactions, particle theory, force, electric circuits and the circulatory system. \nLoughran, Berry, Mulhall and Woolnough (2006) describe the technique used in a \nteacher education setting, noting that encouraging trainees to complete CoRes and \nPaP-eRs can: \n \n \u2015\u2026give them a stronger feel for their own professional development \u2026 \nand [enable them] to explore in more detail the underpinnings of their \nteaching.\u2016 (p 70)   \n \nThe approach has been used by other researchers, including Rollnick, Bennett, \nRhemtula, Dharsey and Ndlovu (2008) who report CoRes and PaP-eRs of South \nAfrican science teachers on amount of substance and chemical equilibrium; and \nRatcliffe (2008) who used the technique to elicit UK-based teachers\u2018 PCK for \nteaching the Nature of Science (NoS).   \n \nSecond, Lee, Brown, Puthoff, Fletcher and Luft (2005) devised a rubric to document \ntrainee science teachers\u2018 PCK. In contrast to Loughran et al (op cit), this is completed \nby researchers, rather than teachers themselves. Lee et al\u2018s (op cit) rubric is based \non Shulman\u2018s two categories of teacher knowledge identified as comprising PCK, \nnamely student learning (in science), and knowledge of instructional strategies. The \nauthors report that data for completing the rubric were gathered from interviews with \ntrainees. The trainees\u2018 comments were assigned by the researchers to one of three \n\u2015levels\u2016 based on the knowledge demonstrated in each category; \u2015limited\u2016, \u2015basic\u2016 or \n\u2015proficient\u2016. Data indicate that the trainees, all of whom were well-qualified scientists, \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 27 \nhad limited PCK, supporting Shulman\u2018s views that PCK is a special type of \nknowledge that is separate from content knowledge. \n \nLoughran et al\u2018s (op cit) CoRes offers the most useful technique devised to date for \neliciting and recording PCK directly from teachers. The method is clearly centred in \nteachers\u2018 skills and knowledge, so a completed CoRe provides a powerful means of \nrecording the work of an experienced teacher, available for sharing and exemplifying \ngood practice. However, the method is not unproblematic: the questions posed in a \nCoRe are challenging, making the task of completing one intimidating to some \nteachers, such as those lacking confidence in their abilities, new to teaching or \nresistant to producing a lengthy, detailed document \u2015just\u2016 for a research project. \nTraining and guidance on completing  CoRes is necessary in order to help them \nunderstand what they are being asked to do, requiring investment of significant time \nto ensure generation of good quality data. The complexity of the knowledge required \nto complete a CoRe means that some may not be able to respond as fully as a \nresearcher really needs. Alternatives are offered by the PaPeRs strategy and use of \nLee et al\u2018s (op cit) rubric. A PaPeR offers an orally-based method of probing PCK. \nThe account can be coded, and\/or entered into a CoRe or an alternative rubric such \nas that of Lee et al (op cit). The rubric suggested by Lee et al (op cit) may be more \nsuitable for use with some \u2015harder to reach\u2016 teachers, who may be willing to \nparticipate in lesson observation and interviews, with a researcher analysing their \nPCK from the information provided. Feedback discussions with the teacher could \nthen take place, making the data-collection process less intimidating than working \nalone to complete a blank CoRe.          \n \n \n\u201cPrompt\u201d studies  \n \nStudies using probes   \nProbe-type studies utilise video excerpts or descriptive prompts as \u2015standard\u2016 \ninstruments for investigating PCK. Teachers are exposed to the probe then respond \nto one or more data collection instruments to reveal the PCK they perceived in the \nprompt material.  For example, Ahtee and Johnston (2006) interviewed trainee \nprimary teachers about the SMK and PCK featuring in a 10-minute video clip of 10-\nyear olds being taught physics concepts. Interview data were supplemented with \nquestionnaire data that enabled the authors to compare attitudes towards teaching \nphysics with those towards teaching other subjects. The authors compared \nresponses given by UK and Finnish trainees, finding more negative attitudes towards \nphysics teaching among the Finnish group. The more positive responses of the UK \ntrainees were attributed to their learning all three sciences at least to the age of 16.   \n \nVeal, Tippins and Bell (1999) included a probe study in their work with two trainee \nscience teachers. In this example, the researchers devised descriptive vignettes as \nprompt material, using these in a longitudinal way, as trainees responded to these on \nfour separate occasions. Repeated use of the same vignettes enabled researchers to \ngain an understanding of how PCK evolved and changed over time. \n \nProbe studies have the advantage that the prompt material can be used relatively \neasily in a wide range of settings, even internationally, as in the first example above. \nThus, teachers working in a variety of contexts and with varying levels of experience \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 28 \ncan be invited to respond, allowing researchers to compare PCK across different \nbackgrounds. A disadvantage of this method is that it relates primarily to PCK \nperceived in the probe material. The full range or quality of PCK a teacher possesses \nmay not be exposed by this technique; its success relies on the nature of the probe \nitself. While such a criticism is also true of other methods (the quality of questionnaire \ndata rely on the type of questions asked, for example), care needs to be taken in \nconstructing the probe to ensure it is likely to generate useful and revealing \nresponses. A second possible disadvantage is that if used once only a probe would \nat best generate a \u2015snapshot\u2016 representation of PCK. However, in some situations \nthis may be appropriate - if a researcher wished, for example, to investigate how \nteachers would respond to students\u2018 misconceptions about a science idea, \u2015one-off\u2016 \ndata collection by probe may be a good way forward. When supplemented with other \nmethods and\/or used repeatedly over time (see Veal et al, 1999) a richer picture of \nteachers\u2018 practices could be obtained.  \n \nIntervention studies  \nThese studies follow a \u2015before\u2016 and \u2015after\u2016 pattern of investigating teachers\u2018 PCK pre- \nand post participation in an intervention. The aim of these studies is to prompt \ndevelopment of PCK on the topic featured in the intervention, for example,  a single \nsession designed to help develop skills in doing chemistry demonstrations, or a \nlonger term series of sessions focusing on teaching a new subject specialism. Two \nexamples are discussed.  \n \nIn their study of teachers\u2018 PCK relating to the micro-macro shift (see above, p XX)   \nVan Driel, de Jong and Verloop (2002) used a workshop as an intervention designed \nto help develop PCK relating to this topic. To investigate its impact on practice, data \nwere collected at three specific points during a one-year chemistry teacher education \nprogramme. Questionnaire data provided a baseline of trainees\u2018 PCK and SMK about \nthe topic; video-recording and transcribing of two workshops showed the nature of \nthe material presented;  and interviews were conducted, indicating trainees\u2018 practical \nexperiences teaching the topic. In addition, trainees\u2018 mentors were interviewed and \ntrainees responded to a second questionnaire focusing on PCK alone. The authors \nnoted that trainees jumped between macro- and micro-representations of matter \nwithout realising that their students could not do the same. They also found that the \nuniversity-based workshops had significant impact on trainees\u2018 practice, as these \nwere timed to take place after trainees had been made aware, through teaching, of \nstudents\u2018 difficulties with the topic.  \n \nA second example relates to helping teachers use models and modelling when \nteaching science. Justi and van Driel (2005) gathered data from five pre-service \nteachers each of whom completed a questionnaire, gave three interviews, collected \ndata from their students, generated written materials in group meetings and wrote a \nreport. The data were used to analyse teachers\u2018 SMK, curricular knowledge and PCK \non the use of models and modelling when teaching science. The range of data \ncollected gave a good overview of teachers\u2018 practices, permitting characterisation of \nthe teachers, and indicated that although models and modelling can be used to teach \nscience concepts effectively, teachers do not have good knowledge about how best \nto make use of them. The authors also point to the value of encouraging teachers to \nreflect on their practice \u2013 in this case, through report-writing.   \n \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 29 \nIntervention studies, like those using probes, have the advantage of being useful with \nnovice and experienced teachers alike. The participants become captive respondents \nin the study, so response of high quality are likely. Researchers can tailor \u2015before\u2016 \nand \u2015after\u2016 data collection methods to the content of the intervention to track changes \nin PCK. Thus, interventions can be combined with a variety of other methods. \nStudies like these are well-suited to evaluating the impact of continuing professional \ndevelopment (CPD) sessions on teachers\u2018 practice. A disadvantage is that \ninvestigation of long-term changes to practice may be absent, limiting analysis of the \nimpact of the intervention to short-term (that is, immediately post-intervention) effects. \nThis leaves the procedure open to the \u2015Hawthorne effect\u2016, in which something new \ngenerates immediate positive outcomes in those experiencing it: an intervention \nstudy may be pre-disposed to claim a number of changes to teachers\u2018 PCK as \nmarked \u2015improvements\u2016 on previous practice.  \n \n \nEliciting PCK: discussion  \n \nAll methods of PCK elicitation have generated fascinating data. Taking the papers \nreviewed here as a representative sample leads to the observation that science-\noriented PCK research tends to divide into two broad categories: developmental \nstudies attempting to track longitudinal changes in PCK and \u2015what is there?\u2016 projects \ninvestigating or recording what teachers \u2015do\u2016 in a given situation or instance. Both \ncontribute to informing science teacher education practice: developmental studies by \nhelping educators understand how PCK emerges and develops and \u2015what is there?\u2016 \nprojects by recording what PCK looks like at a moment in time. (EXAMPLES)  \n \nOf the \u2015what is there?\u2016 methods, that of Loughran et al (XXXX) offers the most \nexplicit and complete approach to elucidating extant PCK. Their CoRes are thorough, \nexplanatory documents that provide a clear picture of PCK used by science teachers. \nAt their best, when completed by experienced science teachers, CoRes have the \npotential to guide teacher educators in working with novices towards achieving good \npractice. In addition, teachers completing a CoRe have reflected carefully on their \npractice, generating a valuable working tool for recording their teaching at a certain \nmoment, but permitting changes as skills or knowledge develop and\/or new ideas \narise. The main disadvantages with this method, as indicated above, are that CoRes \nare time-consuming to complete; training is required to aid teachers in completing at \nleast their first one; and the CoRe may be intimidating and off-putting for some \ngroups of teachers. The use of a rubric completed by a researcher offers a good \nalternative. However, CoRes and PaPeRs are beginning to gain credence with \nresearchers and as these become more widely used are likely to evolve into more \nsophisticated forms.  \n \nStudies using probes such as video excerpts, lesson transcripts and other materials \nalso offer options for a PCK researcher seeking to investigate \u2015what is there\u2016. These \ntend to be less time-consuming than CoRes for teachers to complete and can \nprovide insightful data when used in conjunction with for example, a sound-recording \nof a teacher talking about a probe, an interview and\/or questionnaire. A disadvantage \nis the \u2015snapshot\u2016 effect \u2013 while some studies may benefit from a one-off sampling of \nPCK, the probe method is likely to reveal only some aspects of a teacher\u2018s \nknowledge. In contrast, a CoRe reveals a more thorough and complete picture of a \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 30 \nteacher\u2018s work. However, the method is adaptable \u2013 if used repeatedly, probes can \nhelp to generate a series of PCK \u2015snapshots\u2016 that could be woven together to create \na rich picture, giving the method a developmental aspect.  \n \nInevitably, the methods selected are subject to influence by the researchers\u2018 \nacceptance of one model of PCK over another. An intervention study, for example, is \nundertaken with the belief that the intervention stands a good chance of changing \nteachers\u2018 PCK. For example, van Driel et al (2002) devised a workshop on macro-\nmicro shift to develop PCK for teaching this topic. This is underpinned by a \ntransformative PCK model in which SMK held by a trainee is transformed for \nstudents\u2018 benefit. Resulting changes in practice may support the notion of a \n\u2015mechanism\u2016 for developing PCK. In contrast, a \u2015probe\u2016 study may imply an \nintegrative PCK model underpins the project. Asking teachers to respond to a probe \ninvites a wide range of teacher knowledge, not necessarily subject-specific. Of \ncourse, this depends on the nature of the probe itself \u2013 a tightly drawn scenario \nrelating to students\u2018 misconceptions about a science topic would not fit this image. \nThe point, though, is that in planning a project, consideration of the PCK model \nunderpinning the work is important, as this contributes to selection of appropriate \ndata collection methods.  \n \n \n \nConclusions  \n \nThere is strong evidence that PCK is a useful concept and tool for describing and \ncontributing to our understanding of teachers\u2018 professional practices. That it is a \ncomplex concept is to be expected, as PCK arises from intensely varied human \ninteractions in a variety of situations. Difficulties in understanding PCK arise from its \nelusive nature \u2013 trying to get experienced teachers to articulate their practice is \nproblematic, while following the development of PCK among naive novices with little \nnotion of what teaching entails is equally challenging. Nonetheless, the attraction of \nPCK lies in its ability to tell us something of the unique professional experience that \nconstitutes teaching. In this sense, Shulman is correct in describing PCK as a \n\u2015special amalgam\u2016 that sets teaching apart from other professions. As a concept \ntherefore, PCK does have a value to teaching and teacher educators. This \ndiscussion attempts to draw threads together from the PCK literature presented \nabove to suggest ways forward for science teacher education.  \n \nEvidence indicates that PCK is more complex than Shulman proposed, and clearly \ndevelops over time. A suitable model of PCK to provide a theoretical background for \nscience teacher education needs to take these points into account. Earlier \ndiscussions pointed to a division between integrative and transformative models, the \nformer including SMK within PCK and the latter retaining SMK as a separate \nknowledge base component.  The literature points to more integrative- than \ntransformative-type models being preferred, perhaps because these tend to offer a \nwide-ranging general picture of teachers\u2018 skills and knowledge. Transformative \nmodels tend to focus on subject-specific PCK. The trend towards integrative models \nmay arise because these reflect current practice in teacher education \u2013 initial training \ncourses often present a wide range of components and usually do not indicate how \ntrainee teachers should combine the knowledge presented into a coherent whole, but \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 31 \nleave this to occur naturally during classroom experience. Gess-Newsome (1999) \nsuggests that adoption of integrative models can result in trainees not moving on \nfrom the \u2015transmission\u2016 style of teaching in which a teacher simply lectures, or \ndelivers subject knowledge. In contrast, transformative PCK models have more \nexplanatory power, that is, can provide a clearer statement about how PCK develops. \nThese models imply that a mechanism, as yet unspecified, is involved in developing \nPCK. \n \nTransformative PCK models seem to be most useful for science teacher education. \nThese home in on subject-specific issues, including how to teach difficult and \nabstract ideas that are common in science. A transformative model offers a useful \ntheoretical background for training novice teachers to teach science topics effectively, \nfor example, by helping them to internalise expert teachers\u2018 explanations, analogies \nand instructional strategies.  Magnusson et al (1999) propose a model that seems to \nencompass what is needed. Their five components comprise Shulman\u2018s instructional \nstrategies and knowledge of students\u2018 difficulties, curricular knowledge, orientations \nfor teaching and assessment. The three latter components offer the potential for \nseeing novice teachers develop in different settings, use different teaching \napproaches and take into account the ever-pressing need to assess students\u2018 \nlearning and achievements.  \n \nHowever, there is some evidence (for example, from Appleton, 2005; Marks 1990) \nthat the PCK \u2015picture\u2016 may differ for experienced, \u2015expert\u2016 teachers working within \ntheir preferred specialism. Evidence suggests that these teachers tend not to \narticulate SMK as a distinct component of their knowledge base, but roll SMK into \nPCK.  This feature applies across all phases of education among well-established \nteachers who have gone beyond the initial stages of induction into the profession. \nThis suggests that part of the process involved in becoming a teacher is a re-shaping \nof SMK, adapting this to a school setting to such an extent that prior personal \nknowledge becomes hidden, replaced by a modified version for school use. Deng \nrefers to this as learning \u2015school-SMK\u2016, while Banks et al (2006) propose this as an \nadditional knowledge base component; similarly, Kind and Taber (2004) distinguish \nbetween \u2015SCIENCE\u2016 as an academic subject and \u2015school science\u2016. Although \nchanging SMK in this way may be the learning of PCK itself, the SMK about chemical \nbonding learned during a chemistry degree and that required for teaching a post-16 \nschool-based chemistry course are clearly different. Two points arise from this \nobservation. First, in training to be a teacher, adjustment of SMK must take place. \nAcknowledging that this occurs, and assisting novices through this adjustment may \nbe a way in which training courses could develop. Kind (2008) notes the frustrations \nthat occur among novice teachers in the process of making this adjustment. Second, \nin examining PCK of experienced teachers, integrative models may provide a more \nappropriate theoretical background, as these reflect more closely what is observed in \npractice.   \n \nIn terms of methods for eliciting PCK, Loughran et al (2004) offer the most useful \nmethod currently available. Their CoRes offer the means of gaining a unique insight \ninto teachers\u2018 practices relating to specific science topics. CoRes are working \ndocuments that can be changed at will, so can actively reflect development of PCK, \nthus avoiding the image of a static, unalterable body of knowledge. Training novice \nteachers in writing CoRes would prove valuable in helping develop their ability to \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 32 \nreflect on practice and consider the \u2015real world\u2016 of a professional science teacher.  \nOther research techniques, such as responding to prompt material, may also prove \nuseful in training situations. Use of appropriate vignettes (Veal et al, 1999) or video \nexcerpts (Ahtee and Johnson, 2006) could be valuable in drawing novices\u2018 attention \nto critical classroom events that may help develop PCK.  \n \nThe research evidence discussed in this paper points consistently to three \ncomponents being involved in PCK development among novices: classroom \nexperience, possession of good SMK and having well-adjusted emotional attributes.   \nThe connection between SMK and PCK was discussed thoroughly (p X \u2013 X). In \nadopting a transformative model for PCK, at least for the initial training stage of \nteacher education, the implication is that SMK is a separate knowledge base \ncomponent. Possession of good SMK through academic training seems to provide a \nsecure knowledge base from which to develop effective teaching skills, although as \npointed out in the introduction, this is not the only component. A number of studies \n(Kind, 2008; Veal XXXX) indicate that trainees require good levels of self-confidence \nand a belief system that enables them to take feedback on their practice, handle \nsetbacks and adapt to school life. These factors may help pre-dispose a trainee to \nacquisition of PCK, facilitating internalisation of instructional strategies and \ninformation about students\u2018 learning difficulties in science, for example. Although \nmany initial teacher education courses are selective, in that potential entrants are \nexpected to demonstrate high levels of academic achievement, teacher educators\u2018 \nunderstanding, identification and\/or means of developing emotional attributes and \nbeliefs that \u2015favour\u2016 teaching are less well-defined. These are, of course, more \nproblematic to reveal \u2013 a certificate of \u2015self-confidence\u2016 cannot be produced on \ndemand \u2013 but undertaking further research on the links between these \u2015softer\u2016 \naspects of a teacher\u2018s make-up and academic aspects may provide useful insights \nthat benefit science teacher education.   \n \nTo conclude, science teacher education would benefit from utilising  PCK more \nactively, that is, helping novice and experienced teachers to understand what PCK is, \nand how knowing about PCK may help their practice develop and improve. In order \nto do this, three recommendations are suggested. First, we should agree to adopt a \ntransformative model of PCK, for initial training, or situations in which experienced \nteachers are learning to teach new subjects. These best reflect the process that is \ninvolved in starting out as a teacher, offering a mechanism for changing practice.  \nSecond, teacher education courses should make explicit what PCK is, for example, \nby introducing CoRes as a way of describing current practice, and\/or using \ncompleted CoRes as exemplar material. CoRe completion promotes development of \nreflective practice skills, offering a means of acknowledging changes in PCK through \napplication of classroom experience. Use of vignettes and other prompts may also be \nuseful ways of highlighting and devising instructional strategies.  Third, attention must \nbe given to the emotional side of becoming and being a teacher. While this may be \ndifficult to formalise, it is possible to undertake evaluations of teachers\u2018 self-\nconfidence and efficacy, as well as to analyse belief systems that may impinge on \nclassroom practice. Such evidence, when combined with explicit training in PCK \ndevelopment, would acknowledge that becoming a science teacher involves more \nthan just possessing a good degree in a science subject.  \n \nPCK in science education: perspectives and potential for progress  \n 33 \nOfsted (p X) observe that science teachers too often adopt a passive learning \napproach, transmitting subject knowledge without thought for their learners. This \nsuggests that changes are needed to science teacher education, at least in England \nand Wales \u2013 we need an approach that enables a majority of teachers to move \nbeyond simply \u2015transmission\u2016 of knowledge to a much more active and stimulating \nway of teaching. By placing PCK and its development towards the centre of a \nscience teacher education programme, the precise skills and knowledge involved in \nbecoming a professional science teacher can be better acknowledged, developed \nand improved.  \n \n \n \n \n \nReferences  \n \nABD EL-KHALICK, F.
