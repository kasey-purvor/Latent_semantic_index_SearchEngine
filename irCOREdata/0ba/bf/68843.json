The aim of this study was to use a 3 \ncombined field and modelling approach to determine the importance of Escherichia coli 4 \ngrowth in dung-pats when predicting faecal bacteria accumulation on grazed grassland. 5 \nTo do this an empirical model was developed to predict the dynamics of an E. coli 6 \nreservoir within 1 ha plots each grazed by four beef steers for six months. Published 7 \nfirst-order die-off coefficients were used within the model to describe the expected 8 \ndecline of E. coli in dung-pats. Modelled estimates using first-order kinetics led to an 9 \nunderestimation of the observed E. coli land reservoir, when using site specific die-off 10 \ncoefficients. A simultaneous experiment determined the die-off profiles of E. coli within 11 \nfresh faeces of beef cattle under field-relevant conditions and suggested that faecal 12 \nbacteria may experience growth and re-growth in the period post-defecation when 13 \nexposed to a complex interaction of environmental drivers such as variable temperature, 14 \nUV radiation and moisture levels. This growth phase in dung-pats is not accounted for in 15 \nmodels based on first-order die-off coefficients. When the model was amended to 16 \nincorporate the growth of E. coli, equivalent to that observed in the field study, the 17 \nprediction of the E. coli reservoir was improved with respect to the observed data and 18 \nproduced a previously unquantified step-change improvement in model predictions of 19 \nthe accumulation of these faecal bacteria on grasslands. Results from this study suggest 20 \nthat the use of first-order kinetic equations for determining land-based reservoirs of 21 \nfaecal bacteria should be approached with caution and greater emphasis placed on 22 \naccounting for actual survival patterns observed under field relevant conditions. 23 \n 24 \nKeywords: cattle faeces, die-off, E. coli, grazing, growth, health, pathogen, soil 25 \n 26 \n 27 \n 28 \n   3\nIntroduction 1 \nLivestock are an integral feature of the farmed landscape and a key component of the 2 \nhuman food chain and rural economy. However, management of livestock and their 3 \nmanure must be undertaken with a view to ensure the sustainability of key ecosystem 4 \nservices, such as the provision of clean and safe recreational and drinking water (Pretty, 5 \n2008). Catchments dominated by agriculture have consistently been shown to generate 6 \nhigh faecal indicator organism (FIO) pollutant concentrations in receiving waters (Sinclair 7 \net al., 2009; Kay et al., 2008a). Thus, microbial contamination of watercourses 8 \nrepresents a critical component of diffuse water pollution (Kay et al., 2008b; Defra, 2007) 9 \nand routine agricultural practices such as livestock grazing and manure spreading can 10 \nintroduce a range of bacterial, protozoan and viral contaminants to land via faecal 11 \nmaterial (Wilkes et al., 2009; Oliver et al., 2005). In particular, faeces excreted directly 12 \non pasture from grazing animals can contribute a significant burden of faecal microbes 13 \nto agricultural land, often in excess of 1012 E. coli per hectare during each grazing 14 \nseason (Oliver et al., 2009). Importantly, dung-pats excreted by livestock undergo no 15 \nmicrobial treatment phase (in contrast with stored manures) and so the microbiological 16 \ncontent of faeces deposited directly to pasture is often high, though numbers vary with 17 \nlivestock type, diet and season (Chadwick et al., 2008, Donnison et al., 2008, Weaver et 18 \nal., 2005). Dung-pats from livestock are therefore critical reservoirs of FIOs, such as E. 19 \ncoli, which are key regulatory determinands for assessing the microbiological quality of 20 \nbathing and shellfish harvesting waters as specified in EU directives (CEC, 2006a, 21 \n2006b). 22 \n 23 \nTo reduce microbial contamination of watercourses and ultimately meet compliance 24 \nrequirements at designated bathing waters there is a need to target agricultural 25 \nmanagement options where they are likely to have most effect on mitigating FIO impact 26 \n(e.g. Monaghan et al., 2009; Kay et al., 2007; Oliver et al., 2007). Monaghan et al. 27 \n(2008) propose that the most effective mitigation strategies are those that target the 28 \n   4\nmain sources of contaminants in farm systems. Being able to reliably predict FIO 1 \naccumulation on grazed pastures would therefore prove useful in identifying potential 2 \nmicrobial reservoirs, indicative of high risk critical source areas (CSAs) if combined with 3 \nappropriate drivers such as rainfall events (Moriarty et al., 2008). The importance of on-4 \nfarm microbial reservoirs has been reinforced at the international level with highest 5 \npriority given to \u2018investigating the fate of faecal microbes on farms\u2019 in a recent and timely 6 \nworkshop to establish research priorities for coordinating management of food safety 7 \nand water quality (Crohn and Bianchi, 2008). Predicting the balance between 8 \naccumulation and depletion of E. coli within land-based reservoirs is thus crucial for 9 \nunderstanding the dynamics of (or risk from) diffuse microbial pollution from agriculture.   10 \n 11 \nSince the early 20th century (Bigelow, 1921) first-order kinetics have been used to 12 \ndescribe the population decline of bacteria in research fields as diverse as medicine, 13 \nfood biotechnology and environmental microbiology (Peleg, 2003). When used to 14 \ndescribe populations of faecal bacteria and pathogens in livestock faeces, these kinetics 15 \nare commonly referred to as \u2018die-off\u2019, reflecting the generally held view that populations 16 \ndecline after faeces has been deposited. Consequently any potential risk of transfers to 17 \nthe wider environment and humans is thought to lessen with the passing of time after 18 \nfaeces deposition and thus models and policies reflect this. However, studies 19 \ninvestigating naturally occurring bacterial survival in livestock faeces have tended to 20 \nreport on laboratory scale microcosm experiments (e.g. Echeverry et al., 2006; 21 \nHimathongkham et al., 1999) which remove the complexity and heterogeneity of 22 \ninteracting natural processes. Fortunately, there has been a recent emergence of 23 \nstudies, particularly in North America and New Zealand, to investigate field-relevant 24 \nbacterial die-off in faeces deposited on pasture (Muirhead et al., 2009; Soupir et al., 25 \n2008; Sinton et al., 2007; van Kessel et al., 2007; Meays et al., 2005; Muirhead et al., 26 \n2005). These studies have suggested that bacterial growth may be occurring, thus 27 \n   5\nquestioning the suitability of approximations of FIO die-off in line with traditional first-1 \norder decline. If bacterial growth does occur then the potential underestimation resulting 2 \nfrom first-order approximations can be theorised for a single dung-pat as shown in Fig 3 \n1;b. The aim of this study was to test the suitability of first-order inactivation curves by: (i) 4 \nmodelling E. coli dynamics on grassland grazed by cattle using a traditional first-order 5 \ndie-off equation and comparing the output with field data of E. coli accumulation within 6 \nreplicated 1-ha plots; (ii) determining an approximate growth value for E. coli in freshly 7 \ndeposited faeces via field experimentation in order to amend the first-order modelled 8 \npredictions of E. coli dynamics on a grazed plot; and (iii) providing a first-approximation 9 \nof the magnitude of potential error associated with adoption of first-order decline for 10 \npredicting E. coli reservoirs on pasture whilst appreciating uncertainty within model 11 \nparameters. 12 \n 13 \nMaterials and methods 14 \nField monitored E. coli levels on pasture 15 \nA field study was undertaken to compare modelled predictions of E. coli burden to land 16 \nwith observed data. The field study reported here used the Rowden Research Platform 17 \n(UK National Grid Reference (NGR): SX 650 995) reported previously in others studies 18 \n(e.g. Oliver et al., 2005). Four replicated 1-ha plots were sampled at two week intervals 19 \nthroughout the May to November 2003 grazing season for E. coli and soil moisture 20 \ncontent. Cattle were introduced onto the plots on May 9th and removed on November 21 \n5th, equivalent to Julian day 129 and 305, respectively. Each 1-ha plot was subdivided 22 \ninto a 6 x 6 grid and 12 soil cores (7 cm deep) were bulked from each sub-sector 23 \nsampled. None of the plots had been grazed for over a year prior to 2002 because of the 24 \nUK outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) in 2001 and pre-experiment soil 25 \nconcentrations of E. coli were below detection levels in 2003. To calculate the total 26 \nreservoir of E. coli within each plot, mean cell concentrations per gram of dry weight soil 27 \n   6\nwere multiplied by the estimated dry weight of soil in each 1 ha plot (to a depth of 7 cm, 1 \nas per soil core depth).  2 \n 3 \nField monitored dung-pats 4 \nAn experiment was conducted to determine E. coli content in cattle faeces. This served 5 \ntwo purposes. Firstly it provided a site-specific E. coli content for fresh dung-pats from 6 \nbeef cattle as model input. Secondly, given the potential for bacterial growth to impact on 7 \nthe model results, a field study of E. coli die-off was needed to determine a first 8 \napproximation for the implementation of bacterial growth into the model; it was not 9 \nconducted to provide a detailed account of FIO population increase in dung-pats or 10 \nidentify causal effects. Fresh dung-pats from beef cattle were collected during the 11 \ngrazing season from the experimental site. Dung-pats (n = 6) were monitored to assess 12 \nchanges in the number of E. coli within faeces over time. Six different animals each 13 \ncontributed a single faecal deposit to serve as a replicate dung-pat. The deposits were 14 \ncollected from cattle that had been allowed to graze for over two months, allowing the 15 \ngut microbial community of livestock to develop from that of a housed diet to one typical 16 \nof grazing animals. Each of the six dung-pats was collected from pasture within five 17 \nminutes of excretion from each animal and all six dung-pats were collected within two 18 \nhours of each other. The six fresh dung-pats were transferred, intact, to a grassland plot 19 \nadjacent to the grazed plots because this: (i) prevented cattle treading through the 20 \nexcrement which may have resulted in destruction of a replicate deposit; and (ii) allowed 21 \nfor a more convenient and rapid sampling protocol as each dung-pat was placed in 22 \nrelatively close proximity to the next (~ 1 m spacing). Dung-pats were transferred using a 23 \nsterilised spade (70% industrial methylated spirit [IMS], rinsed with sterile water). The 24 \ndung-pats were not protected from rainfall, thus allowing a population change in 25 \naccordance with field conditions.  26 \n 27 \nSample collection from dung-pats 28 \n   7\nEach of the dung-pats was repeatedly sampled on days 0, 1, 4, 8, 14, 28, 48 and 70 1 \npost defecation. This repeated strategy was adopted because a destructive sampling 2 \napproach was deemed impractical due to the number of dung-pats required to be 3 \nobtained for t = 0 days and also because of the limit on the number of dung-pats one 4 \nanimal makes per day. It was considered that the most dramatic changes in population 5 \nnumbers may occur during the early stages of voidance from the warm and moist gut 6 \nenvironment because environmental conditions on the field surface become variable and 7 \nnot optimal (see also Wang et al., 1996). Thus, sampling was skewed so as to obtain 8 \ncell counts more regularly at the start of the experiment. Approximately 2 g of faeces 9 \nwas collected (0.5 g for bacteriological analysis, 1.5 g for dry weight analysis). Samples 10 \nwere randomly taken from the middle depth region of the dung-pat below the formed 11 \ncrust. Faecal material was removed with a sterile spatula (70% IMS, rinsed with sterile 12 \nwater) and placed into sterile MacCartney bottles (autoclaved at 121oC for 15 minutes). 13 \nMoisture content of faeces was determined by drying 1.5 g of faeces at 105oC for 24 14 \nhours in an oven and then weighing the residual. 15 \n 16 \nMicrobiological analysis of samples 17 \nSoil analysis: All bacterial analysis of samples was conducted within 4 hr of collection. 18 \nBriefly, fresh soil samples were crumbled and 10 g was added to 90 mL sterile water 19 \nprior to mixing for 40 min on a rotary agitator. The resulting soil suspensions were 20 \nserially diluted in sterile water then spread-plated onto MacConkey agar and incubated 21 \nat 37oC for 24 hr before enumeration of colony forming units (CFU). Faecal analysis: a 22 \nmass of 0.5 g of faeces was added to 4.5 mL of sterile water in a sterile 15-mL 23 \ncentrifuge tube and shaken for 60 minutes on a rotary shaker, before being shaken 24 \nvigorously on a Whirlpool mixer for a few additional minutes. Serial dilutions were then 25 \nmade in sterile water and 0.1 mL (or 0.2 mL in cases of low counts) spread-plated onto 26 \nMacConkey agar (Oxoid) as per soil analysis. Those colonies characteristic of E. coli 27 \ngrowing on MacConkey agar were enumerated and seven random isolates were used to 28 \n   8\nconfirm their identity using both MicroPlate test panels (Biolog, Hayward, CA) and API 1 \n20E biochemical identification kits (bioMerieux Vitek, Hazelton, MO). Both these 2 \nprocedures rely on the biochemical profiles exhibited by the test isolates for confirmation 3 \nof their identity through database comparison. 4 \n 5 \nModelling E. coli dynamics on grassland plots 6 \nAn empirical model (Oliver et al., 2009) was adapted to estimate the accumulation of an 7 \nE. coli reservoir on four replicated 1 ha paddocks grazed by four beef steers during a 8 \ntypical six month grazing season in the UK. This empirical model was constructed using 9 \nbiological parameters of die-off, faecal excretion and E. coli shedding rate and was 10 \ninformed by previous field experimentation reported in the literature. The model accounts 11 \ndynamically for the accumulation and depletion of FIO burden to land at daily time-steps. 12 \nThe quantity of E. coli on a defined plot (Equation 1) was calculated as the sum of two 13 \nterms (i) the daily fresh input of E. coli by all livestock; and (ii) the E. coli burden 14 \ndeposited on previous days and now declining as a result of first-order die-off: 15 \n 16 \n   E(x) = Ein(x) + E(x-1)e-bx   (1) 17 \n 18 \nWhere Ex is the magnitude of the E. coli store on day x, Ein is the E. coli input of fresh 19 \ndeposits, e is a mathematical constant (base of natural log), b is the exponential die-off 20 \nconstant. Specifically, daily E. coli loading was calculated by multiplying the number of 21 \ncattle (n = 4) by both the daily dry matter excreted per beef steer and a typical value for 22 \nE. coli per gram of dry cattle faeces (see Table 1). Many literature values for E. coli 23 \ncontent of livestock faeces exist and McDowell et al (2008) provide a succinct summary 24 \ntable from herds across the world. However, in order to constrain uncertainties for this 25 \nspecific study we analysed the E. coli content of dung-pats from beef steers grazing the 26 \nfield site used to evaluate the model to provide an average value for this parameter. 27 \nEstimates of the error associated with dung-pat E. coli content were based on the 28 \n   9\ndistribution of measured values from this study and on the range of existing literature 1 \nvalues for cattle faeces (see Table 2). 2 \n 3 \nSeasonal die-off profiles for E. coli under field conditions typical of the UK are sparse 4 \nand only one study by Avery et al. (2004) provided appropriate data for use in the model 5 \noutlined here (0.061 day-1). Other laboratory based studies do exist but these were 6 \nconsidered unsuitable to extrapolate to field conditions due to the degree of uncertainty 7 \nin translating controlled experimental data to the field. Die-off coefficients from lowland 8 \nareas of New Zealand (which can experience similar climatic conditions as the UK) 9 \nprovided first-order die-off rates of similar range (0.050-0.060 day-1) for spring, summer, 10 \nautumn and winter seasonal experiments (Sinton et al., 2007) to help constrain our 11 \nestimates of the range of error associated with the die-off parameter. Given the scarcity 12 \nof die-off data we allowed a +\/- 33% error in this coefficient. The die-off data was used to 13 \ndetermine the daily E. coli decline within all deposited faecal material for each 14 \nsuccessive day within a six month grazing period.  15 \n 16 \nThe model was run 500 times using randomly chosen parameter scenarios from the 17 \nerror ranges (Table 2). Each scenario was given a different weighting, based upon its 18 \ndeviation from the nominal parameter values (Table 1). Each scenario weighting was 19 \ncalculated using triangular fuzzy membership functions for each parameter, summed to 20 \ngive an overall weighting (e.g. see the approach of Page et al., 2004). When sampling 21 \nthe E. coli concentration distributions a day-to-day correlation of 0.7 was assumed as it 22 \nis unlikely that cattle excrete exactly the same number of cells each day owing to 23 \nbiological variability and fluctuations reported in the literature (Robinson et al., 2009; 24 \nDonnison et al., 2008). This allowed a general \u2018drift\u2019 in shedding rate, but did not allow 25 \nlarge, unrealistic short-term fluctuations. 26 \n 27 \n   10\nThe model was modified to incorporate post-deposition growth using experimental 1 \nresults from this study (see above). This was achieved by taking the average growth 2 \nobserved in the present study for the six days after deposition. As fresh deposits were 3 \ninput on each grazing day this equates to a six-day moving-window of growth through 4 \nthe grazing season. The additional E. coli burden is discussed above and is included as 5 \nspecified by Equation 2. 6 \n 7 \nE(x) = Ein(x) + E(x-1)e-bx + ER(x)   (2) 8 \n 9 \nWhere ER is the magnitude of E. coli growth for any given day. 10 \n 11 \nThe multiple parameter scenarios and associated fuzzy weightings provided a 12 \ndistribution of values for the E. coli reservoir at each time-step, expressed as percentiles 13 \nof these distributions in the sections below. 14 \n 15 \nResults 16 \nMeasured E. coli in the faecal store (dung-pats) 17 \nOverall, E. coli was present on the day of excretion at a mean concentration of 7.12 log10 18 \nE. coli CFU g-1 dry faeces and showed fluctuation in population numbers, rather than 19 \nfirst-order die-off kinetics, during the 70 day period of investigation. The average growth 20 \nrecorded in the first 10 days post defecation was approximately 0.5 log10 CFU g-1 dry 21 \nfaeces before cell numbers gradually declined to a level of 6.06 log10 CFU g-1 dry faeces 22 \nby day 48. However, between day 48 and day 70 cell numbers recovered to a mean of 23 \n6.29 log10 CFU g-1 dry faeces; a level greater than observed 28 days after deposition. 24 \nThe individual die-off profiles for all six dung-pats are shown in Figure 2 along with 25 \nrainfall and air temperature conditions recorded throughout the die-off study. It was not 26 \npossible to use linear or non linear regression analysis on the replicate faecal deposits 27 \nbecause the percentage variation accounted for by the model fittings was inappropriate 28 \n   11\nfor all replicates, demonstrating poor applicability of both linear and non-linear model fits 1 \nto the data points plotted. Deposit 1, 5 and 6 accommodated a final E. coli concentration 2 \nsimilar to that of the initial concentration on day 0. Five of the six replicates experienced 3 \nan increase in E. coli concentrations between day 48 and day 70. Changes in the dry 4 \nmatter content of the dung-pats during the experimental period are shown in Table 3.  5 \n 6 \nMeasured E. coli in the soil store 7 \nBacterial analysis of the topsoil layers (0 - 7cm), which were sampled between dung-8 \npats, detected E. coli numbers ranging between levels below detection (< 5 x102 CFU g-1 9 \ndry soil) through to 106 CFU g-1 dry soil. No water drained from the 1 ha plots during this 10 \ngrazing period because brief spells of rainfall (Figure 3) were insufficient to initiate 11 \ndrainage. On 10 of the 12 sampling dates the mean measured E. coli levels in the plots 12 \nexceeded the upper levels predicted by the model. Only on Julian Days 133 (near the 13 \nonset of grazing), 217 and 309 (end of grazing) were predicted E. coli values of the 14 \nsame order of magnitude as those predicted by the model using 1st order die-off 15 \ncoefficients. Time-series values (mean, 5th and 95th percentiles) of the measured E. coli 16 \nwithin the four replicate plots are shown in Figure 3 by the vertical bars. A paired t-test to 17 \ncheck for differences in mean E. coli stores within observed versus predicted datasets 18 \non the 12 sampling dates showed that the values within the measured dataset were 19 \nsignificantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of the predicted dataset.  20 \n 21 \nModel output 22 \nPredicted E. coli levels on pasture using first-order die-off coefficients and first-order die-23 \noff coefficients combined with the moving-window representation of growth are shown in 24 \nFigures 3 and 4, respectively. The plots show 5th, 50th and 95th percentile of predicted E. 25 \ncoli values. Within approximately 50 days from the onset of grazing the rate of E. coli 26 \naccumulation was seen to reach a near equilibrium (i.e. excreted E. coli and total die-off 27 \nwere approximately in balance) and during each successive day through to Day 305 (the 28 \n   12\nend of grazing), the accumulating E. coli deposition rate exceeded or equalled that of the 1 \ncombined die-off rate for all cells. Using first-order die-off coefficients the maximum 2 \nmean potential E. coli reservoir was predicted to be approximately 3 x 1012 log10 E. coli 3 \non day 305. Incorporation of growth in the order of 0.5 log CFU g-1 dry faeces into the 4 \nmodel increased the maximum value of predicted E. coli burden to approximately 8 x 5 \n1012 log10 E. coli (Figure 4) and reduced the sum of absolute errors between observed 6 \nand predicted E. coli levels by 3 x 1013 CFU; a significant underestimation did, however, 7 \nremain (P < 0.05). On day 305 (the end of grazing) no fresh faecal material was added 8 \nto pasture and the E. coli reservoir declined following a first-order profile for both model 9 \nscenarios. 10 \n 11 \nDiscussion 12 \nAn empirical model governed by biological parameters of die-off, shedding and excretion 13 \nrate is presented. Moriarty et al., (2008) have suggested that for the management and 14 \nmitigation of bacterial pollution of watercourses, and for on-farm microbial risk 15 \nassessment, it would be useful to model the size of faecal microbe reservoirs on 16 \npasture. To do this they propose that data is needed on the bacterial content of fresh 17 \nfaeces and associated die-off data. The research reported here offers a critical first step 18 \ntowards accounting for land-based reservoirs of E. coli. 19 \n 20 \nA key finding of this study was reflected in the difficulty of extracting suitable die-off 21 \ncoefficients for the model. The lack of data informing reliable E. coli die-off estimates for 22 \nfaecal pats under farm conditions meant that we were restricted in our ability to 23 \nparameterise the model with UK field relevant coefficients. An alternative approach 24 \nwould have been to use laboratory derived die-off coefficients but these are less 25 \nrepresentative of environmental conditions (e.g. McGechan and Vinten, 2003; Oliver et 26 \nal., 2006). However, New Zealand derived data from Christchurch (Sinton et al., 2007), 27 \nassociated with similar meteorological conditions to the UK, provided a die-off rate 28 \n   13\nconstant of almost equal value to that used in this study (previously reported by Avery et 1 \nal., 2004) and within the margin of uncertainty embedded into the model structure. This 2 \nprovided reassurances with regard to the suitability of the die-off parameter used. This 3 \nlack of field relevant data to parameterise basic fundamental models of faecal bacteria 4 \naccumulation on land is alarming. Faecal bacteria such as E. coli represent basic 5 \nmicrobial determinands for policy drivers such as the rBWD in Europe (CEC, 2006a) and 6 \nTMDL assessments in the US (Chin et al., 2009) and are key indicators of faecal 7 \ncontamination of water. However, critical data on the most basic behavioural traits of 8 \nthese bacteria \u2013 namely die-off under field relevant conditions \u2013 for UK climatic 9 \nconditions is limited to one study (Avery et al., 2004). Unfortunately the aforementioned 10 \nstudy only covered die-off profiles for faeces deposited in November and so no account 11 \nof differential die-off profiles for differing months, or even seasons, was provided. As a 12 \nresult, in our model we used a step-change approach in die-off coefficients between 13 \nseasons, whereas had sufficient data been available we could have developed a better 14 \nunderstanding of die-off fluctuations over an annual time-course (e.g. used a sine wave 15 \napproximation of seasonal die-off fluctuations). New Zealand-based research has now 16 \nprovided key month-by-month assessments of FIO decline in faeces (e.g. Muirhead, 17 \n2009) but in the UK there appears to be unfounded complacency about the survival of 18 \nbacterial indicators, largely stemming from the fact the much work has been done in the 19 \nlaboratory to study E. coli. Muirhead (2009) detailed the first example of FIO decline in 20 \ndung-pats deposited throughout each month of the year providing a much needed 21 \nresource for researchers investigating bacterial pollution from agriculture. Muirhead 22 \n(2009) therefore represents a key study which other geographic regions across the world 23 \nshould replicate to provide equivalent and comparable datasets of faecal indicator 24 \npopulation dynamics under field conditions.  25 \n 26 \nThe discrepancy in assumed first-order die-off and actual field persistence of FIOs was 27 \nhighlighted using our plot experiment and associated model. As noted by Beven (2007), 28 \n   14\nmore information can often be learned from model rejection than acceptance, leading to 1 \ninference of key processes, in this case the potential for E. coli growth. However, even 2 \nwhen the model was amended with a growth phase the predictions still underestimated 3 \nobserved values on pasture. The accumulating observed total of E. coli within the plot 4 \nsoil should, in theory, have been lower than that of the maximum number of cells 5 \npredicted by the model to be within the faecal reservoir. This is because first-order die-6 \noff would make it impossible to detect larger numbers of E. coli in the soil store (given 7 \nthat concentrations were below detection on day 0) than in the maximum predicted 8 \nfaecal store as first-order die-off implies a decline of cell numbers rather than an 9 \nincrease. The fact that soil E. coli levels exceeded that of the maximum predicted input 10 \nlevels on over 80% of sampling dates suggested that first-order die-off did not 11 \nsatisfactorily describe changes in E. coli populations within cattle faeces and that higher 12 \norder approximations and complex growth patterns operate under field conditions. The 13 \nargument is reinforced further given that a proportion of the FIO population may have 14 \nentered a viable-but-non-culturable state yet detected numbers were still significantly 15 \nhigher than those predicted. This revealed a major underestimation of diffuse source 16 \nbacterial risks from cattle to soil and water quality, with increased threats to public health 17 \nthat may worsen if combined with expected climate change outcomes (Hulme et al., 18 \n2002; Boxall et al., 2009).  19 \n 20 \nOverall the study identified post defecation E. coli growth equivalent to a magnitude 0.5 21 \nlog10 CFU g-1 dry faeces. It is possible that the discrepancy between the observed and 22 \nmodelled E. coli reservoir was a function of erroneous die-off coefficients but the 23 \ncomplementary dung-pat die-off experiment would suggest that growth is a factor often 24 \nignored in faecal microbe fate models, and this is reinforced by other studies (Soupir et 25 \nal., 2008; Muirhead, 2009). Both Sinton et al. (2007) and Van Kessel et al. (2007) 26 \nrecorded potential growth of up to 1.5 orders of magnitude, more than that observed in 27 \nour die-off study. This difference may be related to the timing of the experiments, the UV 28 \n   15\nradiation intensity and variations in ambient temperature among other environmental 1 \nfactors experienced during the period of study but highlights that different levels of 2 \ngrowth may take place during different periods of the year on pasture and may explain 3 \nwhy our amended model still under predicted. 4 \n 5 \n We appreciate that the die-off study reported here represents only a first step in what 6 \nshould be a continued integrated field and modelling research programme and as such it 7 \nhas provided data to help form a first approximation analysis of the impact of ignoring 8 \ngrowth in model predictions. The repeated use of a single value for E. coli growth 9 \nthrough time was somewhat limited because growth may in fact vary day-by-day for 10 \neach deposited dung-pat depending on the complex array or interacting environmental 11 \nvariables. Soupir et al. (2008) observed differing levels of growth and times to reach 12 \ngrowth peak for different seasons so the \u2018moving window\u2019 of growth used in the model is 13 \nperhaps too regular but current knowledge prevented us from modifying this E. coli 14 \ngrowth approximation. 15 \n 16 \nFurthermore, the complementary E. coli die-off experiment using replicated dung-pats 17 \nhighlighted fluctuations of E. coli numbers within faeces over a 70 day period, including a 18 \ngrowth phase not only in the immediate period post defecation, but also a secondary re-19 \ngrowth phase over 40 days after deposition. This was not accounted for in the original or 20 \nthe amended model. During brief periods of precipitation, cell numbers did not decline as 21 \nmight be expected due to wash-out from the faecal deposit. Instead, the resurgence of 22 \ncells in the secondary re-growth phase appeared to coincide with rainfall and may be a 23 \nfunction of the conditions brought about by rehydration of the faecal material and 24 \nrequires further investigation (c.f. Sinton et al., 2007).  25 \n 26 \nIt has been argued that first-order approximations do not account for adaptation of 27 \nbacterial communities. In fact, E. coli are a notable example of bacterial cells capable of 28 \n   16\nadjusting their metabolism in response to stress in order to increase their survivability 1 \n(Corradini and Peleg, 2009), and may explain the observed growth ignored in traditional 2 \nlog-linear models. A key objective is now to investigate field relevant die-off of E. coli for 3 \nvarying UV radiation and rainfall typologies to start to account for variable die-off rates 4 \nand potential for growth as a function of fluctuating field conditions. As noted by Soupir 5 \net al. (2008), higher-order approximations and the inclusion of weather variables are 6 \nlikely to improve predictions of bacterial decline when compared to first-order 7 \napproximations: this will however require an increase in high quality data to constrain 8 \nmodel structures and parameter values. The current lack of representation of growth 9 \ndynamics in models of bacterial die-off, and the general assumption of first-order decline 10 \nequates to a bias or structural error that leads to potential underestimation of diffuse-11 \nsource microbial risks to soil and water quality at the field and catchment scale.  12 \n 13 \nConclusion 14 \nThe availability of fundamental field relevant data for E. coli population dynamics in 15 \nfaeces deposited onto pasture by grazing livestock is currently poor and the reliance on 16 \n1st-order \u2018die-off\u2019 approximations will in some instances significantly underestimate the 17 \nsize of E. coli populations on grassland. Information derived from laboratory experiments 18 \nis not satisfactory to underpin the development of models of bacterial fate and dynamics 19 \nat farm and catchment scales. Given that E. coli are monitored across the world, 20 \nbecause of regulatory drivers and legislation criteria for water quality and human health, 21 \nthis emphasises the need to understand better the behaviour of faecal bacteria in the 22 \nenvironment. This critical finding has wide-ranging implications that may be applicable to 23 \nother faecally-derived bacteria and disease causing microorganisms such as E. coli 24 \nO157:H7 (c.f. Prysor Williams et al., 2008). It is therefore relevant to microbial 25 \necologists, policy makers, agronomists and those working in soil and water science who 26 \ncan use this data to frame future evaluations of bacterial risks to public health, the 27 \nhuman food chain and key ecosystem services such as the provision of clean and safe 28 \n   17\nrecreational and drinking water. The potential of E. coli population increase under 1 \nenvironmental conditions highlights that we should focus on understanding bacterial 2 \npopulation dynamics and their ability to proliferate and persist in the environment rather 3 \nthan deriving traditional distinct coefficients that focus only on \u2018die-off\u2019, which are both 4 \nmisleading in terminology and erroneous in nature. This is especially pertinent given 5 \npredicted changes in surface soil temperature and moisture under grasslands which may 6 \nfavour survival further and thus exacerbate human health risks in the future.   7 \n 8 \nAcknowledgements 9 \nFunding was provided by Lancaster University, The University of Sheffield and the 10 \nBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC).
