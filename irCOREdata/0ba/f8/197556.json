Co-convened \nby Prashant Kidambi (School of Historical Studies, University of Leicester) and Clare \nAnderson (Department of Sociology, University of Warwick), it marked an important \nmoment in the history of the association, for it was the first conference held under the \nauspices of two newly merged societies - the British Association for South Asian \nStudies and the South Asian Studies Association. The new BASAS is grant-aided by \nthe British Academy, and as such it seeks to represent and advocate for British-based \nresearch of and in South Asia, and to combine financial assistance with support for \nresearch. It is an umbrella for a range of activities, and promises both to invigorate \nand to raise the profile of British-based research of and in South Asia: within Britain \nand the UK, across Europe, and internationally.1 The 2008 conference was significant \nfor another reason to, for it was the first time that this annual BASAS event had met \nin Leicester, one of Europe\u2019s most multi-cultural cities and home to a large population \nof South Asian descent. It was somehow apt that over one hundred scholars from \nacross the disciplines of anthropology, geography, history, literature, sociology, \nphilosophy, and political science, and from over a dozen countries in Europe, North \nAmerica, and South and East Asia, met in a city which is celebrated for its diversity \nand community cohesion. The conference programme incorporated 25 panels, some \nopen and others themed, and one special BASAS session convened by BASAS chair \nGraham Chapman, \u2018Water and Mis-Development\u2019. It was a special pleasure to \nintroduce the eminent Indian anthropologist, Vishvajit Pandya, as keynote speaker. \nHis anthropological reading of tribal violence in the Andaman Islands - \u2018Signifying \nPractices: the violent Other in placeless-place\u2019 \u2013 was enthusiastically received by the \nconference delegates.2\n This special conference edition of Contemporary South Asia \u2013 published by \nTaylor and Francis which generously part sponsors the annual meeting - brings \ntogether something of the disciplinary range and geographical and temporal scope of \nthe conference papers presented and discussed in Leicester. Paper themes ranged from \nhistories of medicine, childhood, and colonization to debates around interactions \nbetween state and society, the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami, and critical readings of \n\u2018Queer\u2019 Bollywood. Panel titles included \u2018The Genealogy of Colonial Discourse\u2019, \n\u2018Gender, History, Representation: subaltern voices in and of South Asia\u2019, \n\u2018Nationalism, Identity, and Ethnic Conflict in Sri Lanka\u2019, \u2018Dalits in the Indian \nEconomy\u2019, \u2018Continuity and Change: a comparative analysis of contemporary India \nand Pakistan\u2019, and \u2018A New India? Studying India in the long twentieth century\u2019. The \nannual conference provides an excellent opportunity for delegates to meet, to work \nthrough ideas, and to develop current and future research projects; the meeting in \n \n                                                 \n1 The BASAS webpage has now shifted to http:\/\/www.britac.ac.uk\/institutes\/SSAS\/about.htm  \n2 The conference programme and panel abstracts are available through the BASAS website: \nhttp:\/\/www.basas.ac.uk\/conference08\/2008_Annual_Conference_Programme.htm, accessed 1 October \n2008.  \n 2 \nLeicester was no exception. Its informal yet strongly international and \ninterdisciplinary feel makes it a valuable forum for experience faculty as well as \npostgraduates and early-career researchers who wish to present papers in a supportive \nand encouraging intellectual environment. \n The volume explores some of the interconnected themes that emerged during \nthe conference across a range of disciplines and historical and contemporary contexts. \nIt represents BASAS members\u2019 vigour and depth in research in the humanities and \nsocial sciences, with the papers ranging geographically across much of South Asia - \nIndia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan \u2013 to East Africa, Britain, and the USA. \nThe papers focus on the gendered construction of identities in the context of \ngeographical and \/ or social mobility, linking gender, identity, and movement across \nspace and society to questions of rights, nationhood, and citizenship. The articles \npresented here stress in particular the need to understand and to develop further ideas \naround \u2018woman\u2019 as a relational social category and to trace the intersection of local \npractices with broader national and international social concerns and transformations. \nParticularly refreshing is their focus \u2013 whether historical, literary or ethnographic - on \nindividual and collective experiences of state and society. Women emerge as a central \nconduit for the formation of community-based identities; colonialism and its \naftermath loom large, reminding us of the need to situate and to understand \nhistorically what we might want to celebrate, challenge or confront in the present day. \n The volume opens with Nico Slate\u2019s prize winning paper on the American \ntravels of feminist, socialist, and anti-colonial activist, Kamaladevi Chattopadhyaya, \nduring the 1940s. He frames her encounters with feminists and African Americans in \nthe USA as a form of \u2018coloured cosmopolitanism\u2019 that encouraged social unity across \n\u2018racial\u2019 boundaries. He argues that Chattopadhyaya was a powerful conduit for \ncritiques of America, and that in raising awareness of the civil rights movement in her \nmany published essays and writings, she played an important role in forcing domestic \nchange. Chattopadhyaya embodied the intersectionality of multiple oppressions \naround \u2018race\u2019 and gender, and through her own imprisonment came to symbolise the \nincarcerated nation. \nJoanna Herbert\u2019s article takes up one of the underpinning themes of Slate\u2019s \npaper: the use of individual histories as a methodological tool for historical and social \nanalysis. Herbert draws on the life stories of first generation Ugandan Asians in \nLondon and Leicester to explore their experiences of expulsion from East Africa in \n1972. She argues that the Ugandan Asian diaspora represent their collective \nexperiences through a lens that refracts ideas of masculine pioneering through those \nof female vulnerability and loss, so producing \u2018woman\u2019 as a relational category of \ngendered analysis. However, she shows how this collective identity cloaks a range of \nexperiences amongst Ugandan Asian women. Though suffering was a central theme \nin their remembered histories of dispossession and expulsion, their narratives reveal a \nsense of active agency and dynamic mobility.  \nWe remain in the Indian Ocean for Stephanie Jones\u2019s reading of allegory and \nrealism in the first South Asian East African novel in English, Bahadur Tejani\u2019s Day \nAfter Tomorrow (1971). Jones discusses some of the complexities and contradictions \nof the text by positioning it within its political and literary context and against \npostcolonial nation discourse theory. She argues that in its symbolism the novel seems \nto suggest the desirability of (South Asian) biological and cultural assimilation within \na dominant pre-historic \u2018African sensibility\u2019 where Africans were associated with \nfemininity and South Asians with masculinity. This gendering was both determined \nby and enacted through the tropes of \u2018race\u2019 and \u2018class\u2019, which linked the African to a \n 3 \ntimeless, pastoral ideal, and the Asian to \u2018the \u201cwhite\u201d colonial and neo-colonial \nexploiter\u2019 \u2013 or even \u2018Jew\u2019. And yet, as Jones shows, Tejani also offers a more material \nportrait of the novel\u2019s central female character, Nanziri, as \u2018a capable woman doing \nordinary things\u2019. She suggests that Tejani\u2019s concern with everyday practices reveals \nthe \u2018fundamental incoherence of national discourse\u2019 \u2013 but also suggests his \ncommitment to the possibility of more inclusive nation-based African solidarities. \nMeena Dhanda deals with the issues of gender, identity, and mobility through \nam ethnographic frame, exploring the ways in which the nature and meaning of caste \nis negotiated rather than given or invented. Her focus is on dalit Punjabi youth; she \nunpicks carefully the multiple positions through which they negotiate their sense of \nsocial place in the UK (Wolverhampton) and in India (Punjab). Sexual relationships, \nintimacy, and marriage emerge as central themes in her analysis, for it is here that \nstark differences between the two communities emerge. Dhanda shows that caste \nborder-crossings are more common amongst Indian Punjabis than British ones, \nrevealing the nature of a perhaps surprising interconnection of geographical and social \nmovement. The political and the personal become interlocked, with identities \nenveloped within a range of religious, national, and ideological (notably feminist) \nlocations. As she cautions: \u2018Identity assertion may be seen as a mode of mobilization \nused by dalits but it would be a mistake to see it as their end.\u2019 \nThe final two articles in the volume explore women\u2019s experiences of and \nresponses to two devastating natural disasters that affected the Bay of Bengal in 2004. \nIn discussing widespread flooding in Bangladesh, Keiko Ikeda invokes a gender-\nfocused analysis in her elaboration of community-based natural disaster risk \nmanagement. She shows that women and men experience natural disasters differently, \nand argues that their concerns should therefore be taken into account by local agents \nof development. As Ikeda draws out the multiple difficulties and possibilities \nsurrounding the incorporation of women in \u2018traditional\u2019 structures of authority, once \nagain we see gender as a relational social category. Moreover, in her assessment of \nthe gaps between women\u2019s concerns and risk-reduction action, Ikeda offers important \nand policy relevant suggestions for policies and practices in and of development. \nKatharina Thurneer is also concerned with the experiences of people caught in \ncrisis, in her case the Sri Lankan communities affected by the devastating tsunami of \nDecember 2004. It is estimated that 35,000 Sri Lankans \u2013 and more women than men \n\u2013 lost their lives in the disaster, with one million made homeless. Thurnheer shows, \nhowever, that far from being passive recipients of what is sometimes called a second \ntsunami of international aid, Sri Lankan communities used access to financial and \nother resources as a means of strategic self-positioning. In this way, they were able to \nnurture \u2018hopes amid destruction\u2019 in their negotiations with \u2018a range of connected \nconstraints and possibilities\u2019. Gender relations informed the interaction between local \nagendas and external interventions in significant ways, and were themselves in \nconstant transformation within a wide frame of social change. \nThese articles highlight three interlinked themes that emerged during the \nBASAS Annual Conference 2008, and so show the intellectual possibilities of \nassembling papers from across historical time, geographical space, and oft-times \ndisciplinary distance. There is a remarkable synergy to the authors\u2019 theoretical \nframeworks and to their connected thematic concerns. Thus the papers are suggestive \nof the significance and broad appeal of both interdisciplinarity and the need to think \nthrough the historical rootedness of contemporary concerns, in local and global \nperspective. Moreover, they serve as an important reminder that gender must remain \ncentral to research in and of South Asia.  \n 4 \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe editor of this special issue would like to thank Prashant Kidambi and Sandeep \nBakshi, who co-organised and co-ran the 2008 conference; the conference delegates; \nthe contributors to and peer reviewers of this volume; the BASAS Executive \nCommittee and Chair, Graham Chapman for their support; and, John Zavos, editor of \nContemporary South Asia.  \n"}
