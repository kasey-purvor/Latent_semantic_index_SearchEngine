The most recent \nwritings of authors as different as Giorgio Agamben, Jacques Derrida and John Gray suggest \nthat the questions about relationship between humans, animals and politics, which this \ndeceptively simple dictum in fact begs, are today very topical. This said, I propose to engage \nwith these authors\u2019 writings by turning firstly to a recent episode concerning that moment \nwhen the modern subject comes closest to feeling like an animal, namely as they approach \nthe moment of their death.1 \n \nIn late June 2001, lawyers representing Diane Pretty sought to obtain a grant of immunity \nagainst legal prosecution if Pretty\u2019s husband were to assist her to commit suicide and so \nterminate her increasingly unbearable suffering from motor neurone disease (McVeigh 2001). \nAs the case was increasingly publicised in the media, the British public rallied behind Pretty \nand her lawyers. It wished to see the courts rule in Pretty\u2019s favour, because otherwise these \ncourts would be condemning Pretty to a fate worse than that suffered by a \u2018tortured animal\u2019 \n(Barclay 2002). Eventually, however, the Law Lords, the highest judicial body in the land, \ndismissed Pretty\u2019s request. Strikingly, the case would not have been nearly as problematic \nhad Pretty been attached to \u2018life-sustaining\u2019 technology, as it would then have been within \nher rights to order an attending physician to disconnect such technology and thus bring about \nher death. The public\u2019s outraged reaction to this situation is best summarised by the old adage \n\u2018the law is an ass\u2019 (Thornton 2001; see also Grayling 2002). More importantly, however, a \nnumber of commentators argued that Pretty\u2019s difficult situation highlighted the need for a \n\u2018politics of death\u2019, that is, a new way of thinking about life that is more adequate to the \nunprecedented capacity of contemporary bio-medical technology to keep humans alive, but at \nthe cost of their being \u2018increasingly in thrall to machines\u2019 (Riddell 2002). Any dissenting \nvoices were lost in the wind, if not simply dismissed as motivated by \u2018religious prejudice\u2019 \n 14 November 2008: 2 \n(Riddell 2002; cf. Birkett 2002).  \n \nThe concrete question I would like to address is whether the Law Lords\u2019 refusal to sanction \nPretty\u2019s request that she be allowed to die in a manner and at a time of her own choice was \nindeed as asinine as the majority opinion seemed to believe. Arguably, however, this question \nis far from straightforward. To unravel the underlying problems, the first part of this essay \nwill focus on Agamben\u2019s genealogical reflections on the relationship between humans and \nanimals. As it will hopefully become clear, these reflections are particularly important to any \nunderstanding of the bio-political implications of life and death in late modernity (see Seale \n1999). Strikingly, contemporary bio-politics seriously tests the philosophical framework that \nwould appear to have informed Western thought about the distinctive nature of human life. In \nfact, it appears to coincide with the emergence of radically different understanding of life \nmore generally, whereby all categorical distinctions between the \u2018human\u2019 and the \u2018animal\u2019, \nand the \u2018human\u2019 and the \u2018machine\u2019, seem to lose any meaning, even the residual meaning that \nAgamben would attach to them. It is from this perspective that, in the second part of this \nessay, I will juxtapose Agamben\u2019s reflections and Paul Rabinow and Bruno Latour\u2019s recent \nattempts to extend the category of the \u2018nonhuman\u2019 well beyond the biological confines set by \nAristotle. Significantly, Agamben would argue that these attempts are symptoms of the \u2018end \nof history\u2019. \n \nLife after the \u2018end of history\u2019 \nJacques Derrida has recently noted, very provocatively, that it is Adam\u2019s pre-lapsarian \nnaming of the animals, and the consequent separation of human and animal life, that marks \nthe beginning of human history (Derrida 2002: 385-387). Symmetrically, a number of \neschatological texts suggest that, during the interlude between \u2018the end of days\u2019 and the \u2018day \nof judgement\u2019, when the divine law will be suspended, the boundaries between humans and \nanimals will once again be blurred beyond recognition. As Giorgio Agamben has noted, this \nmillenarian motif once prompted a debate between Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve and Georges Bataille \nover the fate of humanity after the end of the historical dialectic, when all fundamental \nantinomies would be finally resolved (Agamben 2002: 15-18). According to Koj\u00e8ve, \n \nThe disappearance of Man and the end of History \u2026 is not a cosmic \ncatastrophe: the natural World remains what it has been from all eternity. \nAnd therefore, it is not a biological catastrophe either: Man remains alive as \n 14 November 2008: 3 \nanimal in harmony with Nature or given Being. What disappears is Man \nproperly so-called, that is, Action negating the given, and Error, or, in \ngeneral, the Subject as opposed to the Object. In point of fact, the end of \nhuman Time or History, that is, the definitive annihilation of Man properly \nso-called or of the free and historical Individual, means quite simply the \ncessation of Action in the full sense of the term. Practically, this means: the \ndisappearance of wars and bloody revolutions. And also the disappearance \nof Philosophy; for Man himself no longer changes essentially, there is no \nlonger any reason to change the (true) principles which are at the basis of his \nunderstanding of the World and of himself. But all the rest can be preserved \nindefinitely; art, love, play, etc., etc.; in short, everything that makes Man \nhappy (Koj\u00e8ve, as quoted in Agamben 2002: 14-5). \n \nThe question Bataille and Koj\u00e8ve then debated was whether humans who were no longer \npreoccupied by questions of \u2018difference\u2019 could be described as \u2018happy\u2019, as opposed to being \nmerely \u2018content\u2019. For Bataille, sheep grazing on rich pastures might be said to be content, but \ncertainly could not be said to be happy. Basically, he refused to accept Koj\u00e8ve\u2019s implicit view \nthat the aesthetic life of \u2018art, love, play\u2019 somehow was less than \u2018superhuman, negative and \nsacred\u2019 (Bataille, as quoted in Agamben 2002: 15). If, with the \u2018end of history\u2019, humanity \nfinally escaped the prison of reason, the \u2018man of the future\u2019 should not be understood as then \nbecoming somehow comparable to a \u2018contented\u2019 animal. Bataille proposed instead that the \n\u2018man of the future\u2019, a \u2018future\u2019 that in his view was already manifest, was better understood as \nan \u2018acephalic man\u2019, a \u2018negativity without employment\u2019 that expressed its distinctive nature in \n\u2018eroticism, laughter, and joy before death\u2019 (Bataille, as quoted in Agamben 2002: 16-17). \nWhile Koj\u00e8ve and Bataille never settled their disagreement, Koj\u00e8ve eventually came to view \nthe late-modern, global triumph of capital as the end of the dialectic, and argued that post-\nhistorical life was becoming so purely formal that contentment and happiness could no longer \nbe distinguished. In his view, the extreme example of this post-historical, hermeneutically \nvoid life was offered by the \u2018perfectly gratuitous suicide, which has nothing to do with the \nrisk of life in a fight waged for the sake of historical values\u2019 (Koj\u00e8ve, as quoted in Agamben \n2002: 22-3).  \n \nWhile objecting to the philosophical idealism, which clearly informed these arguments and \ncontrasting claims about the future of humanity, Agamben believes that an inquiry into \nemergence of the post-historical human form is none the less urgent since the material and \ninstitutional boundaries between human and animal life are everywhere manifestly \ncollapsing. Following Michel Foucault, but also taking issue with the latter\u2019s argument that \nthis collapse is due to a peculiarly modern construction of political order, Agamben \narticulates the renewed inquiry into the boundaries between human and animal life along two \n 14 November 2008: 4 \nrelated lines, namely biological and juridical.2  \n \nFirstly, Agamben notes that, where we would use the term \u2018life\u2019, Classical culture \ndistinguished between two forms of existence, zo\u0113 and bios. Zo\u0113 referred to the form of life \nshared by humans and animals alike, a form concerned with material sustenance and \nreproduction. Bios referred instead to the ethical and political form of life that was oriented \ntoward the realisation of the polis and, as such, was peculiar to humans alone (Agamben \n1998: 3-5). For Aristotle, however, this was insufficient since the social habits of some \nanimals blurred the distinction. Yet, his effort to explain the origin of human institutions \nwithout recourse to the Platonic eidos and all the categorical distinctions predicated thereon \nwas fraught with ambiguities that he was never able fully to resolve. Consequently, Agamben \nargues, discovering what is peculiar to the \u2018anthropophoric animal\u2019, that is, what is distinctive \nabout the animal bearing human characteristics, has entailed an endless comparative \ndissection of life, focusing most recently on the location of animal life in the very inner being \nof human life (Agamben 2002: 30). As Richard Dawkins announces that the decoding of the \nhuman genome is best understood as the rendering of the Biblical \u2018word\u2019 into \u2018flesh\u2019, the \nworking of the \u2018anthropogenic machine\u2019 set in motion by Aristotle reaches its end: bios and \nzo\u0113 materially become one (Dawkins 2001; see also Palladino 2002: 206-208). Secondly, \nAgamben also argues that, on Aristotle\u2019s definition of the \u2018human\u2019, the law is the sole \nguarantor of the separation of bios and zo\u0113. Again, because Aristotle rejected the Platonic \neidos, the authority of the law then has to rest on the possibility of its suspension and the \nimplicit threat of reversion to animal life. Today, Agamben notes, this brutal, but essential, \ntruth of the law is everywhere obvious, as the internment of refugees emphasises how much \ncontemporary notions of \u2018citizenship\u2019 and immunity from the arbitrary power of the \n\u2018sovereign\u2019 do not rest on inalienable \u2018human rights\u2019, but on the contingencies of birth, on the \ncontingencies of humanity\u2019s species existence (Agamben 1998: 126-135).  \n \nSignificantly, for Agamben, the comatose in a \u2018persistent vegetative state\u2019 provides the most \nstriking exemplification of the fate of \u2018bare life\u2019 as the historical process he articulates \nreaches its conclusion. With the advent of a millennial \u2018zone of indistinction\u2019, being alive or \ndead becomes a matter of the bio-medical and juridico-political determination of the \u2018life \nunworthy of being lived\u2019, the notorious legal concept that paved the way to the Holocaust \n(Agamben 1998: 136). Not surprisingly, Agamben concludes still more ominously that the \n\u2018camp\u2019 is the future (Agamben 1998: 166-180). \n 14 November 2008: 5 \n \nA problem arises, however, when the denuded \u2018anthropophoric animal\u2019 itself decides that its \nlife is \u2018unworthy of being lived\u2019. Arguably, this is in fact a supreme gesture of sovereignty, \nthough one might want to recall Koj\u00e8ve\u2019s remarks about the emptiness of suicide after the \n\u2018end of history\u2019.  \n \n(Un)principled arguments \nThere can be little doubt that the Law Lords were sincerely moved by Diane Pretty\u2019s difficult \nsituation. Yet, they also maintained that they were bound to uphold the \u2018sanctity of life\u2019, the \nprinciple that human life should always be protected as far as is humanly possible (House of \nLords 2001: para. 5). Moreover, if Pretty\u2019s medical condition made it impossible for her to \ncommit suicide, this was a power over which legal institutions had no control, and, as such, \nthese institutions could not be construed as having violated any rights that Pretty might \notherwise enjoy (House of Lords 2001: para. 19). In fact, it seemed to the Law Lords that \nPretty\u2019s lawyers had misinterpreted the Suicide Act (1961), insofar as it simply \ndecriminalised the taking of one\u2019s own life, and did not confer any \u2018right to death\u2019 (House of \nLords 2001: para. 35). According to Pretty, however, the law failed to recognise how \ncontemporary bio-medical technology was bringing about a situation where the paradoxical \nnotion of a \u2018living death\u2019 was becoming a mundane reality. In fact, she had become so \ncompletely dependent on others, human and nonhuman, that, when asked whether life was \nnot better than death, she would answer: \u2018I am dead\u2019 (Barclay 2002). For Pretty, being dead \nor alive was not a matter of categorical opposition, but part of a continuum whereby death \nmight sometimes be preferable to life. As such, her unquestionable right to \u2018human dignity\u2019 \nentailed both a legal recognition of her freedom to choose between life and death, and the \nsanctioning of any mechanisms that would realise such freedom (McVeigh 2001; see also \nDyer 2001).  \n \nFrom this perspective, Pretty\u2019s case might then be summarised as a clash between two \nfundamentally different conceptions of the relationship between life and death, which are \nusually characterised as \u2018sanctity of life\u2019 and \u2018quality of life\u2019 arguments.3 Yet, other aspects \nof the case cast doubt on this all too seductive construction.  \n \nThe Law Lords were in fact less than convinced about the \u2018sanctity of life\u2019, and the corollary \n 14 November 2008: 6 \nbeliefs \u2018that euthanasia and assisted suicide are always wrong\u2019, as operative fundamental \nprinciples, especially in a society where \u2018many millions do not hold these beliefs\u2019 (House of \nLords 2001: para. 54). Moreover, when previously asked to consider the case of Tony Bland, \na comatose \u2018living\u2019 in a \u2018persistent vegetative state\u2019, the Law Lords agreed to allow the \nwithdrawal of the medical support that had kept Bland alive for four years. Bland died \npromptly thereafter. According to the Law Lords, this course of action did not constitute \n\u2018murder\u2019 because, even if the withdrawal of medical support was bound to result in Bland\u2019s \ndeath, there was no \u2018intention\u2019 to kill Bland. If there is any point of agreement between most \nthoughtful proponents and opponents of euthanasia, such Peter Singer and John Keown, it is \nthat this decision was not based any principled defence of the \u2018sanctity of life\u2019 (Singer 1994: \n57-80; Keown 2002: 217-281). The Law Lords were quite capable of determining where the \nboundaries between life and death should be drawn, and they did so on the basis of pragmatic \nconsiderations. Similarly, the Law Lords\u2019 rejection of Pretty\u2019s request rested largely on their \nview that her preference for death did not outweigh their legal responsibility toward the life \nof others who might be less capable of resisting unwarranted, external pressure to bring their \nlives to an end (House of Lords 2001: para. 15). In other words, the Law Lords\u2019 position was \nutilitarian and consequentialist, rather than principled (see Oxenham and Boyd 1997). \n \nPretty\u2019s position was no more consistent. She wanted to die at home and leave her death in \nthe hands of her husband. As she put it in one of her many interviews: \u2018If I am allowed to \ndecide when and how I die, I will feel that I have wrested some autonomy back\u2019 (Dyer 2001). \nTo do so, this \u2018vulnerable\u2019 woman, who lived completely \u2018in the thrall of machines\u2019, took \nadvantage of another machine, her \u2018lightwriter\u2019, to publicly downplay both her ability her \nability to commit suicide on her own and the relief offered by palliative medicine (Barclay \n2002; see also Lawson 2002). She emphasised instead how the law was forcing her to endure \ninsufferable agony, and how, under such conditions, her agony could only end with her \ndrowning in her own saliva (Barclay 2002). This and other similarly horrific images allowed \nPretty to mobilise the public and the media to understand the case as an unambiguous \nconfrontation between a very problematic legal principle, \u2018the sanctity of life\u2019, and its \ninhuman consequences. For Sarah Barclay, who was involved in the production of a BBC \ndocumentary on the case, the law was forcing Pretty to live like a \u2018tortured animal\u2019. As she \nput it: \n \nWhen Diane Pretty wants to tell you something, she makes a noise that is a \n 14 November 2008: 7 \ncross between a grunt and a moan \u2026 If no one can understand what Diane is \ntrying to say, the grunt becomes a low-pitched scream. If you still cannot \nunderstand, it starts to get louder. Eventually, she opens her mouth wide and \nhowls, a sound which makes the hairs stand up on the back of your neck. \nYou can hear this cry from halfway down her street. If you did not know \nthat Diane Pretty lived in that house, you would think it was an animal being \ntortured (Barclay 2002). \n \nA personal preference for the timing and manner of one\u2019s death was thus transformed into a \npublic campaign for the legalisation of \u2018assisted suicide\u2019 (see Lyons 2002). Significantly, this \nwas such a \u2018good story\u2019 about the evils of sovereign power that, when some journalists \ninsisted on describing Pretty as someone completely dependent on others, Pretty would \nsometimes object (Barclay 2002). Pretty\u2019s success in pursuing her case as far as she did \ndepended on her very careful choreography of \u2018strength\u2019 and \u2018vulnerability\u2019, and a good deal \nof confusion of boundaries between the \u2018human\u2019, the \u2018animal\u2019 and the \u2018machine\u2019 (Birkett \n2002; see also Cussins 1996).  \n \nIn sum, every position articulated during the eleven months between Pretty first request that \nher husband be allowed to aid her suicide and her death on 12 May 2002 was historical and \nuntrue to any categorical distinction. Strikingly, even Pope John Paul II, an intransigent \ndefender of the \u2018sanctity of life\u2019, has found himself at a loss when confronting the power of \ncontemporary bio-medical technology to extend life to the point where the ill and the elderly \nmight desire death. All that he has been able to do is evoke the increasingly doubtful notion \nof a \u2018natural\u2019 span of human life, beyond which physicians should simply allow patients to \ndie (Rome and Browne 2002; see also Caygill 2000a). The question then is whether this \nsituation exemplifies the realisation of Giorgio Agamben\u2019s \u2018zone of indistinction\u2019, or it is \ninstead a symptom of the inadequacies of Agamben\u2019s genealogy.  \n \nThe crisis of the Enlightenment \nIn his own recent writings on the lives of humans and animals, John Gray notes how the \ncategorical distinctions between these lives are deeply rooted in Judeo-Christian notions of \nthe \u2018fall\u2019 and the possibility of \u2018salvation\u2019 by purging humanity of all traces of its post-\nlapsarian animality (Gray 2002). He also adds that these Judeo-Christian notions, often \ndisguised by their neo-Platonic renditions, continue to manifest themselves in the common \nbelief in \u2018human progress\u2019 through the technological mastery of everything, including the \n\u2018animal\u2019 and the \u2018human\u2019. The failings of such redemptive thought are so innumerable to list \n 14 November 2008: 8 \nthat Gray prefers to then conceive of the human condition as a \u2018tragedy\u2019 (Gray 2002: 194). If \ntragedy presumes transgression, the transgression lies in the failure to recognise that, \n \nThe ideal of the chosen life does not square with how we live. We are not \nauthors of our lives; we are not even part-authors of the events that mark us \nmost deeply. Nearly everything that is most important in our lives is \nunchosen. The time and place we are born, our parents, the first language we \nspeak, these are chances not choice. It is the casual drift of things that \nshapes our most fateful relationships. The life of each of us is a chapter of \naccidents. \n \nPersonal autonomy is the work of our imagination, not the way we live. Yet \nwe have been thrown into a time in which everything is provisional. New \ntechnologies alter our lives daily. The traditions of the past cannot be \nretrieved. At the same time we have little idea of what the future will bring. \nWe are forced to live as if we were free. \n \nThe cult of choice reflects the fact that we must improvise our lives. That \nwe cannot do otherwise is a mark of our unfreedom. Choice has become a \nfetish; but the mark of a fetish that is unchosen (Gray 2002: 110). \n \nIn other words, the world is devoid of reason, and life is a meaningless interlude between \nbirth and death.  \n \nStrikingly, Gray repeatedly bolsters his nihilism by turning to \u2018the lesson of evolutionary \npsychology and cognitive science\u2019 (Gray 2002: 79). Despite his assertions that human \ncertainties about the nature of the world are delusional, his own certainty about the \nmeaninglessness of human life is grounded in a socio-biological understanding of life, \nhuman, animal and machinic, whereby human history is nothing but the accidental product of \na thoroughly orderly struggle. Thus, Gray argues that, \n \nThinking of our bodies as natural and of our technologies as artificial gives \ntoo much importance to the accident of our origins. If we are replaced by \nmachines, it will be in an evolutionary shift no different from that when \nbacteria combined to create our earliest ancestors. (Gray 2002: 16). \n  \nMoreover, if Gray objects to Thomas Hobbes\u2019s understanding of the emergence of political \norder, perhaps because such understanding is accompanied by an unwarranted faith in human \nprogress, the evolutionary struggles in which Gray grounds his nihilism are in fact predicated \non the naturalisation of the Hobbesian individual, totally autonomous and brutally \ncompetitive (Gray 2002: 28).  \n 14 November 2008: 9 \n \nThus, whereas Ren\u00e9 Descartes appealed to a benevolent God to secure his understanding of \nthe world, an understanding that was less than sympathetic toward animals, Gray turns \ninstead to Richard Dawkins\u2019 \u2018blind watchmaker\u2019, who draws no distinctions between humans \nand animals (Dawkins 1986; see also Shanahan 2001). Judeo-Christian dualism is not \ndiscarded, but simply inverted, so that the \u2018good\u2019 lies in freeing the body from all pretence \nthat we are anything other than moved by our need for sustenance and the imperative of \nreproduction. Significantly, David Marquand has recently noted how Gray\u2019s nihilism speaks \nvolumes about Gray\u2019s tacit, unwavering belief in \u2018original sin\u2019 (Marquand 2002; see also \nBauman 1992: 88-91). \n \nIf Gray exemplifies the bewildering effects of the pervasive convergence of political and \nbiological thought, Giorgio Agamben articulates the present crisis by turning to Martin \nHeidegger\u2019s thoughts on the relationship between human and animal. The ultimate \nconsequence of the emptiness at the heart of modern conceptions of the \u2018human\u2019 is that the \n\u2018anthropophoric animal\u2019 now oscillates hysterically between two poles. On the one hand is \nthe temptation to ignore the unfathomable mystery of humanity\u2019s relationship to its own \nanimality, and then attempt to take charge of such animality by bio-political means. On the \nother hand is the temptation to embrace animality, by way of the aestheticisation of \u2018life\u2019 \n(Agamben 2002: 121). Either pole leads to a \u2018politics of death\u2019, as the paradoxes of National \nSocialism amply attest (see Herf 1984).4 For Agamben, the only way out is to transcend the \nconcept of the \u2018anthropophoric animal\u2019, by rejecting any attempt to articulate a relationship \nbetween human and animal life, because any such attempt will always fall back into the \ndilemma that Heidegger highlights. The way forward is provided by Walter Benjamin\u2019s own \npoetic reflections on life after the \u2018end of history\u2019 (Agamben 2002: 122-126). Now, however, \nthe millennial blurring of distinctions between the human and the animal should be \nunderstood as the realisation of Heidegger\u2019s Gelassenheit, a quiet humility before the \nmysteries of the world (Agamben 2002: 132-138).  \n \nSignificantly, Jacques Derrida\u2019s thoughts on the \u2018human\u2019 and the \u2018animal\u2019 suggest that \nAgamben\u2019s conclusion underscores a fundamental understanding of human life as \nmelancholic waiting for death. Following Agamben, we can at best note how Diane Pretty\u2019s \ncase marks the extent to which we internalised a bio-political order that will eventually \ntransform everyone into \u2018bare life\u2019. The \u2018camp\u2019 is the future, a dystopian future of our own \n 14 November 2008: 10 \nmaking. Despite Agamben\u2019s rejection of Alexandre Koj\u00e9ve and Georges Bataille\u2019s idealism, \n\u2018bare life\u2019 is the new transcendental truth, though now transmuted into \u2018absolute evil\u2019 \n(Derrida 2002: 387-392; see also \u017di\u017eek 2002: 136-141). \n \nThe coming \u2018politics of life\u2019 \nArguably, Paul Rabinow and Bruno Latour\u2019s very different approaches to \u2018life\u2019 offer an \nalternative to the seemingly inescapable \u2018politics of death\u2019. \n \nGiorgio Agamben\u2019s reading of the Classical distinction between bios and zo\u0113 lies at the heart \nof Rabinow\u2019s most recent inquiries into contemporary developments in the field of bio-\nmedical technology (Rabinow 1999: 13-17). Rabinow is the first to acknowledge that these \ndevelopments are radically altering our understanding of humanity, as it becomes possible to \nenvisage a future where human beings will be designed like any other technological artefact. \nYet, he rejects Agamben\u2019s dystopian vision of the future and its underlying Foucauldian \n\u2018hermeneutics of suspicion\u2019, whereby such developments should be disclosed as figures of \nsome more stable discursive configuration, namely the deadly discourse of \u2018bio-power\u2019 \n(Rabinow 1999: 173). Rabinow\u2019s increasing concern with the event of novelty, which Michel \nFoucault was never able to fully confront, leads him to abandon Foucault for Gilles Deleuze.5 \nDeleuze would appear to offer the possibility of a more positive engagement with the \nmundane world of human labour, witnessing, for example, how people appropriate and \nmanipulate the biological constituents of human and animal bodies so as to construct new \nidentities for themselves and profoundly reconfigure the socius (Rabinow 1996: 91-93).6 \nWhile this might very well mean that \u2018the man of the future will be filled with animals\u2019, this \ndoes not mean that Rabinow is rejecting bio-power for the socio-biological constitution of the \nworld (Rimbaud, as quoted in Rabinow 1996: 92; see also Deleuze 1988: 124-132). He is \nsimply noting that who we are is no longer a matter of deciphering the contours of a \ntranscendental figure trapped in the mortal body of the animal, be it the sublime \u2018soul\u2019 or the \nabject \u2018gene\u2019. It is instead the effect of the playful recombination of cultural artefacts, \nincluding the artefacts of bio-medical technology. Hence, the coming formation should be \nmore properly understood as \u2018bio-social\u2019. Needless to say, avoiding falling back into the \nJudeo-Christian narrative or its Illuministic translations and inversions also entails the \nadoption of a new ethic of being, which Rabinow summarises as: \n \n 14 November 2008: 11 \nAn experimental mode of inquiry \u2026 where one confronts a problem whose \nanswer is not known in advance rather than already having answers and then \nseeking a problem (Rabinow 1999: 174).\n  \n  \nElsewhere, I have argued that Rabinow\u2019s implicit, normative denial of historical \nconsciousness should be understood as actively contributing to the coming post-historical \ncondition (Palladino 2002: 198-202; see also Bauman 1992). This said, Rabinow is still very \nmuch the anthropologist interested in how the human is constituted today, as the boundaries \nbetween humans, animals and machines are far less secure than they once were (Rabinow \n1999: 180-182). Latour, instead, is committed to press the argument beyond Rabinow\u2019s \nrenewal of nominalist epistemology, toward the redefinition of ontological categories (Latour \n1999a: 21-22).7 \n \nLatour rejects all transcendental principles that might secure a categorical distinction between \nhumans, animals and machines. The construction of entities and their meaning is instead the \nlaboured and mundane product of \u2018circulating reference\u2019, which ties together a system \nencompassing a multitude of actors, human and nonhuman. Moreover, such mundane labour \nis not the product of mathesis, the science of strategic calculation, but of metis, the \u2018clever \nand crooked path of technical know-how\u2019 (Latour 1999a: 174). Latour\u2019s guiding motto is: \n\u2018essence is existence and existence is action\u2019 (Latour 1999a: 179). Such emphasis on action \nalso means that every moment, however seemingly insignificant, should be understood as the \nadvent of something radically new. As Latour puts it: \n \nNowhere in this universe, which is not of course nature, does one find a \ncause, a compulsory movement, that permits one to sum up an event in \norder to explain its emergence. If it were otherwise, one would not be faced \nwith an event, with a difference, but only with the simple activation of a \npotential that was there all along (Latour 1999a: 153). \n \nThis understanding involves the rejection of historical time for a version of kairological time, \nthe millennial time. This modality of time, however, is no longer understood in its Judeo-\nChristian reformulation as the interlude between the \u2018end of days\u2019 and the \u2018day of judgment\u2019 \n(Latour 1999a: 242; see also Alliez 1996). Kairological time is instead returned to its original \nClassical meaning as \u2018the moment when the course of time, insufficiently directed, seems to \nhesitate and vacillate, for the good as well as the bad of man\u2019 (Pierre Aubenque, as quoted in \nAlliez 1996: 244).  \n \n 14 November 2008: 12 \nFrom this perspective on the passage of time and the mundane, material entanglement of all \nhuman action, it is perhaps not surprising that Latour should have no time for subjective, if \nnot melancholic, relationships between humans and animals. They are all prey to empirically \nunwarranted anthropocentrism (Latour 1999b: 42-50). Latour is instead quite prepared to \nconsider animals and other nonhumans as \u2018things\u2019, albeit on the condition that humans should \nalso be understood as \u2018things\u2019, or, more precisely, on the condition that these humans \nrecognise how concepts such as the \u2018human\u2019 and \u2018things\u2019 trap them into the Heideggerian \ncycle of violence: either bio-power or the aestheticisation of \u2018life\u2019 (see Latour 1999a: 174-\n215).  \n \nOn Latour\u2019s account, Diane Pretty might then be understood as one of the heterogeneous \nmultitude, all those invisible and countless parties that enable, but also suffer at the hands of \nthe law. In the metistic fashion of this multitude, Pretty draws together material artefacts such \nas the \u2018lightwriter\u2019, people such as the lawyers and journalists in need of a \u2018good case\u2019 or a \n\u2018good story\u2019, and institutional organisations such as the Voluntary Euthanasia Society and \nLiberty. In so doing, she becomes someone who counts politically. She can publicly reveal \nboth the incoherence and fundamental violence of the law, as it divides the world between \nthose who can determine the boundaries between life and death and those who cannot, \nsometimes preferring to devolve its authority on machines rather than humans (Riddell 2002). \nAccording to Latour, what we then need is a new democratic order that is more fully aware of \nthe enslaving work accomplished by technologies of power, such as the categorical \ndistinctions between humans, animals and machines, and that will thus emancipate the \nmultitude from its bonds of servitude (Latour 1999a: 174 and 266-292). If anything \nsummarises Latour\u2019s motivations, it is his rephrasing of the Rousseauvian motto \u2018Man was \nborn free, and everywhere he is in chains\u2019 into \u2018Nonhumans are born free, and everywhere \nthey are in chains\u2019 (Latour 1999a: 172). \n \nLatour\u2019s understanding of the world and its ordering certainly is more promising than \nAgamben\u2019s apocalyptic vision and passive response to the changing relationship between \nhumans, animals and machines. Yet, the positive, exhilarating reading of Pretty\u2019s case, which \nLatour enables, should be balanced against the manner in which Pretty also is a party to the \ndisaggregation of all human bonds of solidarity. Three sets of conceptual problems within \nLatour\u2019s framework help to clarify the reasons for such ambivalence.  \n \n 14 November 2008: 13 \nFirstly, when articulating his understanding of the \u2018multitude\u2019, Latour often elides the \ndifference between the \u2018multitude\u2019 and the \u2018mass\u2019. For example, he turns to Plato\u2019s Gorgias \nto illuminate the authoritarian foundations of the most basic cognitive categories to which \ncontemporary thought on humans, animals and machines is the heir (Latour 1999a: 216-235). \nThe demos, who Plato famously despised, should be understood as exemplifying the \n\u2018multitude\u2019 that Latour wishes to free. Yet, Latour overlooks how the demos already \nconstituted a political order, which excluded women, slaves and foreigners, and how the \nagora in which it articulated its grievances was a highly codified space. As Deleuze and F\u00e8lix \nGuattari would note, the same could be said of the \u2018mass\u2019, a thoroughly historical rendition of \nthe \u2018multitude\u2019 (see Latour 1992). Moreover, if it is in fact the \u2018mass\u2019 with which Latour is \nconcerned, the desires of the \u2018mass\u2019 should not be conflated with the desire that impels the \ndisruptive movements of the \u2018multitude\u2019. The former is nothing but the historical \u2018anti-\nproductive\u2019 desire for that which the \u2018mass\u2019 does not enjoy, namely the power of sovereignty \n(Deleuze and Guattari 1984: 1-16; and 1988: 208-231). In other words, the \u2018mass\u2019 is \nmotivated by resentissment and as such already exists in the shadow of the law (Nietzsche \n1996: 22-25; see also Deleuze 1985). The question, however, is what is the nature of this law. \nPretty\u2019s uncompromising insistence on her right to the complete determination of the manner \nand timing of her death certainly points to the atomistic individualism of capital. \n \nSecondly, Latour himself provides no explicit account of the forces impelling the movements \nof the multitude or the mass, because he is concerned with effects rather than causes. Yet, his \nretrospective accounts of the interactions from which new entities come into the world \nrepeatedly evoke an underlying Hobbesian assumption of autonomous, competitive \nindividuals (see Latour 1988). He would appear to ignore alternative possibilities, such as \nDeleuze\u2019s turn to a Humean understanding of the individual, whereby the primary desire is \nfor unity, and conflict is a secondary consequence of such desire (see Deleuze 1991: 37-54). \nThe implications of the preference for Hobbes rather than David Hume are twofold. \nEntanglement with others is based on the purely negative terms that characterise \ncontemporary neo-Liberal \u2018contractualism\u2019. Moreover, the advent of novelty is then formal \nrather than substantive, and, as such, it is always reversible: contracts can always be \nrescinded and the historical situation resulting from the contracts can equally be returned to \nthe prior order.8 This is the striking presumption of \u2018communitarianism\u2019, and its argument \nthat the destruction of historical bonds of solidarity wrought by capital can simply be undone \nby a \u2018new contract\u2019, or a \u2018new constitution\u2019 (see Latour 1993).9 It seems to me that it is from \n 14 November 2008: 14 \njust this perspective that we might begin to unravel not just Pretty\u2019s implication in the \ndynamics of capital, but also the paradoxical concomitance of denunciations of all residual \nattachment to Judeo-Christian values, such as the \u2018sanctity of life\u2019, and the celebrations of \nPretty\u2019s death with the words \u2018she is free at last\u2019 (Riddell 2002; Dyer 2002). This is not so \nmuch a contradiction, occasioned by the incomplete secularisation of contemporary society. \nRather, it is a symptom of evacuation, such that the performance of Pretty\u2019s trial and death \nwas undoubtedly spectacular, but also hermeneutically void (see also Botting 1999).10 \n \nThirdly, and finally, Latour fails to note a performative contradiction, which is best captured \nby the paradox of Jean Jacques Rousseau\u2019s Social Contract, whereby humanity would only \nrealise its freedom under the rule of law (Rousseau 1968: 83). If action is, as Latour \nmaintains, immanent with the multitude or mass, then it is perfectly reasonable to expect that, \none day, animals and machines themselves will realise their freedom. Indeed, it is just \npossible that at some point in the post-revolutionary future, a nonhuman historian will recall \nhumans as \u2018little more than \u2026 industrious insects pollinating an independent species of \nmachine-flowers that simply did not possess its own reproductive organs during a segment of \nits evolution\u2019 (De Landa 1991: 3). Like John Gray, Latour is not unduly worried about this \nprospect. Yet, on Latour\u2019s account, nonhumans\u2019 freedom would none the less seem to require \na \u2018lawgiver\u2019 to write the \u2018new constitution\u2019 and thus enable the advent of the \u2018parliament of \nthings\u2019. Not only will this new legislator\u2019s actions require a motivating, transcendental \nprinciple, but also what this principle is remains unclear. Perhaps what motivates Latour is in \nfact the same nightmare that haunts Agamben, and Heidegger before him, that of an \n\u2018autonomous technology\u2019 (see Winner 1977). It is simply too horrible to contemplate what \nmight happen if the multitude were to liberate itself. The multitude must therefore be tamed \naccording to the neo-Liberal principles underpinning contemporary notions of democracy. \nThe other is welcome as long it surrenders its radical alterity, by allowing us to become more \nlike it, but, preferably, by it becoming more like us (\u017di\u017eek 2002: 64-66). \n \nIn sum, others\u2019 silent, but inescapable omnipresence, which compels Latour\u2019s impossible \ndesire to speak of them, in themselves and for themselves, cannot escape the asymmetry and \ninevitable, impending violence of the situation (Derrida 2002; see also Dillon 1999). Latour\u2019s \nimplication that time is not affective entails an escape from responsibility for \u2018I\u2019, the \nperformatively, if not historically, separate from the multitude. Echoing Latour, and \ncontradicting him, humans\u2019 present, fraught relationship with animals and machines may be a \n 14 November 2008: 15 \nhistorical construct, but it cannot be undone without denying humans\u2019 irreversible and finite \nexistence in the time opened by the naming of the animal (and other nonhumans). \n \nWhy \u2018sanctity of life\u2019 is worth defending \nThe arbitrariness of death\u2019s toll, that moment in which humans thus come closest to being \nlike an animal, cannot be escaped. Ontologically, humans may not be categorically distinct \nfrom animals and other nonhumans, but historically they are quite so. At the very least, the \nwhole history of the Enlightenment is a history of denying any form of submission to \narbitrary powers such as those that characterise animals and other nonhumans\u2019 existence. \nToday, this denial takes the form of questions about the boundaries between life and death. \nTaking responsibility for this historical situation and its consequences, that is, becoming a \n\u2018political animal\u2019, means making sense of the inescapable and fraught relationship to others, \nand then acting upon our reflections, under conditions of radical incalculability and \nuncertainty (\u017di\u017eek 2002: 152-154; see also Caygill 2000b).  \n \nDiane Pretty sought to challenge the exclusive power of the law to determine the boundaries \nbetween life and death. Her efforts should be welcomed, but it should also not be forgotten \nthat the very conditions whereby her voice could be heard means that she is no representative \nof the multitude upon which the power of the law rests (see Ranci\u00e8re 1998: 1-19). Her \ndetermination to end her life under conditions of her own choice may indeed be a gesture of \nsovereignty, but sovereignty always entails violence, in this case toward the plurality of sick \nand infirm who might choose death simply to relieve all those who have to care for them. The \nquestion is before whom such violence might be justified. What is at stake in Pretty\u2019s case is \nnot the coming \u2018suspension of the law\u2019, whereby all that we are is the bodies \u2018filled with \nanimals\u2019 of the interlude between the \u2018end of days\u2019 and \u2018the day of judgment\u2019. It is instead the \nthorough evacuation of time and being advanced by the law of capital. Not to think about this \nissue, not to think about the law or pretend that it carries no weight because it is a mere \nhistorical artefact, would be no more than to live like Georges Bataille\u2019s contented sheep.  \n \nConsequently, I will conclude by maintaining that the law was indeed \u2018an ass\u2019, but not \nbecause it failed to adapt, but because it was unwilling to uphold principle, an understanding \nof life as a supreme gift, and to do so despite all the new uncertainties that arise from the role \nof bio-medical technology in reshaping the boundaries between human, animals and \n 14 November 2008: 16 \nmachines. In so doing, it foreclosed the room for any renewal of the dialectic between Plato \nand Aristotle, the very ground of a politics that is oriented toward life rather than death. Yet, \nif I echo Slavoj \u017di\u017eek (2000), in calling for a defence of the \u2018sanctity of life\u2019 in such \nuncompromising terms, effectively ignoring the historical defeat of such concepts, I cannot \nbut wonder if I am not in fact engaged in intellectual terrorism that speaks volumes about \nhaving already become one of Bataille\u2019s sheep, which grazes on rich pastures, \u2018conscious and \nyet resigned to the coming slaughter\u2019 (Bataille, as quoted in Agamben 2002: 18).11 As John \nDonne once said, \u2018Never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee\u2019. \n \nNotes \nI wish to thank Nik Brown, Paul Fletcher, Nick Gane, Anne Kerr, Tiago Moreira, Marcia Pointon, Barry \nSandywell, Robin Wooffitt, Steve Yearley and Teresa Young for their comments and criticism of this essay. I \nam also very grateful to Mick Dillon, Adrian Mackenzie and Kirsten McAllister for provoking me to think much \nmore rigorously about the concept of \u2018life\u2019. If I have not yet succeeded to do so, the fault is all mine. \n \n1\n Arguably, this is a peculiarly modern construction of death. It entails an understanding of death as the ultimate \nsubmission to arbitrary power. Moreover, such power so defies any reflective understanding that it undermines \nall the distinctions between the human and the animal which secure modern humanism. See Ari\u00e8s (1987): 405 \nand Bauman (1992): 12-50. Significantly, in his novel The Lives of Animals, James Coetzee repeatedly evokes \nthis connection between humans, animals and death. While the novel\u2019s main protagonist, Elizabeth Costello, is \ndeeply concerned about the cruel relationship between humanity and the animals it exploits, the reader is \nrepeatedly reminded that Costello\u2019s death is impending, and that only in death will she find relief from her \nprofound sadness about the fate of animals. \n2\n Strikingly, Agamben\u2019s approach, whereby the problems of modern bio-political order are traced back to a \nClassical compact, echoes Derrida\u2019s critique of Folie et D\u00e9raison, as articulated in Derrida (1978).  \n3\n On fears of enduring a \u2018living death\u2019 and their relationship to the modern reconfiguration of death, see Ari\u00e8s \n(1987): 396-401. On the difficulties arising from contemporary efforts to maintain a meaningful distinction \nbetween \u2018sanctity of life\u2019 and \u2018quality of life\u2019, see instead Singer (1994): 106-131.  \n4\n For a further, striking illustration of this paradoxical understanding of the relationship between humans and \nanimals, see Barbara Smuts\u2019 essay, appended to Coetzee (1999). Although Smuts is a renowned evolutionary \npsychologist, whose work is integral to the evolving field of socio-biology and its unrepentant reduction of \nhuman life to the objective conditions of animal life, her essay evokes an intensely subjective relationship to \nanimals.   \n5\n As is widely understood, Foucault rejects all notions that oppositional arguments are in any way external to \npower, and argues instead that such arguments can only be historically meaningful insofar as they are \nunderstood as co-constitutive of an evolving discourse; see Foucault (1980b). Arguably, however, Foucault \ncould only advance this argument by ignoring the dynamics of spatio-temporal dislocation; see Foucault (1980a) \nas well as Deleuze and Guattari (1994). \n6\n Significantly, Agamben notes how Deleuze provides an alternative to the Heideggerian impasse, describing it \nas an \u2018attempt to think of the animal in a fashion that is absolutely not anthropomorphic\u2019, but he never fully \nengages with this alternative, dismissing it as simply reproducing \u2018bare life\u2019 and its attendant problems. See \nAgamben (2002): 63 and (1999): 236.  \n7\n On the differences between Rabinow and Latour, see Rabinow (2000). On the relationship between Latour and \nDeleuze, Latour certainly acknowledges his debt to Deleuze, but its full implications are unclear. At the very \nleast, they both draw heavily on Spinoza\u2019s monism; see Deleuze (1990) and Latour (1988). \n8\n Admittedly, Latour is less than clear when he writes \u2018I can simply say that I have inherited Pasteur\u2019s microbes, \nI am the descendant of this event, which in turn depends on what I make of it today\u2019 (Latour 1999a: 168). While \nhe bolsters this point by referring to Stengers (1993), thus suggesting some sense of the irreversibility of \nhistorical processes, this is inconsistent with his simultaneous dismissal of any principle of causation. Moreover, \n \n 14 November 2008: 17 \n \nLatour (1987) suggests that processes of construction can be reversed, in principle, if not in practice. \n9\n For an introduction to the issues at stake in understanding the fraught relationship between \u2018contractualism\u2019 \nand \u2018communitarianism\u2019, see Cohen (2000) and Jayasuriya (2002). \n10\n The implicit distinction between the formal qualities of mortuary ritual and hermeneutics might go some way \ntoward reconciling Ari\u00e8s\u2019 claim that modernity is characterised by the \u2018disappearance of death\u2019 and Clive \nSeale\u2019s contrary view that \u2018we live in a cultural environment containing a plethora of discursive representations \nof death\u2019; Seale (1998): 144. See also Bauman (1992). \n11\n Strikingly, Olivier Roy (2002) argues that Osama bin Laden\u2019s attacks on the symbolic centres of capital are \nsymptomatic of the more general, historical failure of Islam to provide a viable political alternative to Western \ngeo-political order, which then only allows for individual acts of terrorism that are fundamentally pointless. At \nbest, such acts guarantee the terrorist\u2019s individual salvation. I wonder whether the same might not be said of \n\u017di\u017eek, as he too seeks impossibly to escape the logic of capital; see \u017di\u017eek (1999) and Palladino (2002): 224-229. \n 14 November 2008: 18 \n \n \nReferences \nAgamben, G.
