The testimony provided by 38 bystanders at the trial \nof two ten year old boys for the murder of two and a half year old James Bulger is \nanalysed. It is argued that their failure to intervene can be attributed to the fact that \nthey assumed - or were told - that the three boys were brothers. The way in which \nthis category of \u2018 the family\u2019 served to prohibit or deflect intervention is analysed.  \nThis approach is contrasted with a traditional bystander apathy account of the \nbystanders actions in the Bulger case.  It is argued that bystander (non) intervention \nphenomenon should be analysed in terms of the construction of social categories in \nlocal contexts.\nKeywords\nBystander apathy; James Bulger; murder trial; social categories; the family.\n2\nIntroduction\nOn Friday 12th February 1993, James Bulger, a two and a half year old boy, was \nabducted from his mother by two ten year old boys. The three boys then walked \naround the city of Liverpool, England, for more than two hours before James was \nmurdered beside a railway line. It was a crime that seized the public imagination, \nattracting saturation newspaper and television coverage in Britain (Franklin and \nPetley 1996) as well as the attention of the international media (see Christy and \nVoigt 1994, Bourquin 1994, Gripsrud 1995). The case was also the focus of a number \nof books and articles (Thomas, 1993, Smith 1994, Sereny 1994a, 1994b, 1995, Jackson \n1994, Morrison 1997). Much of this work centres on the question of what, if \nanything, this brutal murder tells us about the state of society. Attempts to answer \nthis question are broken down into two parts: the first part is the question of why \nthe two boys committed the murder. The second part is the question of why \nnobody intervened to stop them. It is the second of these questions that will be the \nconcern of this paper. What lessons can we learn about bystander non-intervention \nfrom this case?\nThere is a curious and rather uncomfortable parallel between the James Bulger \nmurder and the case that was the progenitor of the bystander intervention \nparadigm: the murder of Kitty Genovese in New York in 1964.  There were 38 \nwitnesses to the rape and murder of Kitty Genovese outside her apartment building \nin New York in an attack which lasted for more than half an hour (Rosenthal 1964). \nIt was the failure  of the witnesses to intervene that was the starting point for a \nseries of investigations by Latane and Darley (1968, 1970, Darley and Latane 1968). \nThis work culminated in what became known as the 'bystander effect' - the finding \nthat people are more likely to receive help when a single bystander is present, than \nwhen a group of bystanders are present. In their review of the first ten years of \nwork on bystander non-intervention, Latane and Nida (1981) argue that this \nphenomenon is one of the most replicated and well founded in social psychology. \nHowever, in spite of this strong claim they go on to say that \u201cthe research has not \ncontributed to the development of practical strategies for increasing bystander \nintervention. .[..].. not one of us has been able to mobilise the increasing store of \nsocial psychological understanding accumulated over the last decade to devise \nsuggestions for ensuring that future Kitty Genoveses will receive help\u201d (Latane and \nNida 1981: 322). This is amply demonstrated by the fate of James Bulger. In an echo \nof the Genovese case, 38 witnesses were called at the trial of Jon Thompson and \n3\nRobert Venables for the murder of James Bulger. These 38 witnesses had all seen or \nhad contact with the three boys on their walk across Liverpool to the place where \nJames was killed. None had  intervened successfully to save his life.\nIn this paper I will argue that this failure to translate research on the bystander effect \ninto practical strategies for increasing intervention may be a function of how the \nresearch question itself has been conceptualised.  Whilst there has been some work \non the importance of the characteristics of individual bystanders  (Bickman 1971, \nClark 1974, Cramer, McMaster, Bartel and Dragna 1988; see also Eagly and Crowly \n(1986) for a review of the work on gender and helping), most researchers have \nfocussed on the question of  \u2018number of people present' in helping situations. This \nemphasis can clearly be seen in Latane and Nida's (1981) review of the literature in \nwhich more than fifty studies were included in a meta-analysis which used 'number \nof bystanders present' as the key analytic variable. This paper will begin by \nconsidering why 'number of people present' became the key question in bystander \nintervention research and then look at some of the issues which are obscured or \nomitted by the focus on this particular question. I will then go on to argue, based on \nthe evidence given by the witnesses to the James Bulger murder trial, that it may be \nmore useful to think about the question of intervention in terms of the way social \ncategories are deployed to make sense of (and account for) the event, rather than \nthe question of how many people are physically co-present at the scene.\nDecontextualising bystander (non) intervention - Kitty Genovese revisited\nIn order to ground this critique of the traditional bystander paradigm it is necessary \nto go back to the Kitty Genovese case and explore how the murder was originally \ntranslated into a series of psychological questions. Darley, in an interview with \nEvans (Evans 1980: 216) describes how he and Latane sat around a dinner table and \nbegan to analyse the incident in social psychological terms. They eschewed \n'personality' accounts of the bystanders behaviour in favour of immediate \nsituational factors that might have inhibited helping. They picked up on current \nsocial psychological work in 'group-inhibition' and 'diffusion of responsibility', and \nused such concepts as the fulcrum of their work. They then went into the laboratory \nand produced a number of inventive, detailed and highly choreographed \nexperiments in which the number of people present (or believed to be present) was \nthe key variable. The experiments explored helping in situations like an epileptic \nseizure (Darley and Latane 1968), a potential fire  (Latane and Darley 1970) and an \n4\naccident at work (Latane\u2019 and Darley 1975). Based on this work, a five stage model \nof bystander intervention was proposed. For intervention to occur a bystander \nwould need to notice the event; interpret it as a emergency; assume personal \nresponsibility; feel competent to help; and then help. It was argued that a break in \nany one of the steps in the model would lead to a failure to intervene. It was at the \nthird stage of the model that group inhibition or diffusion of responsibility was seen \nto have most influence. The presence of other people seemed to inhibit feelings of \npersonal responsibility. Very quickly evidence began to mount for the 'bystander \neffect' - the general principle that numbers of people present and likelihood of help \nwere inversely related. This then became the predominant strand of bystander \nresearch - the legacy of the experimental work which had begun with Kitty \nGenovese.\nCherry (1995) argues that this translation from event to research topic is an example \nof what she calls 'culturally embedded theorising'. A number of important features \nof the original event were not translated into the research paradigm because they \nwere not yet recognised as 'problems'. For example, Cherry points out that the \nGenovese murder was a violent attack by a man on a woman. It could have been \nseen as a prototypical example of male violence towards women (as Brownmiller \n(1975) was later to do). However, in the early 1960's  the feminist critique of male \nviolence had yet to become established. The public at large, and academic \npsychologists in particular, were not yet sensitised to male violence as a social and \npsychological problematic. As a consequence, neither gender nor physical violence \nwere factored into the original laboratory studies that attempted an experimental \nanalogue of the Kitty Genovese murder. In almost all of these studies the focus is on \ngeneralised helping behaviour and diffusion of responsibility rather than male-\nfemale relatedness.  While it may be that the bystander effect holds for these \ndecontextualised and mainly laboratory based studies, Cherry goes on to show that, \nin the few studies which did retain an interest in both gender and violence, a \ndifferent story emerges. For example, Borofsky et al (1971) conducted a role playing \nexperiment with male and female dyads in which an 'attack' was simulated. The \n'attacks' (male on female; male on male; female on male; female on female) were \nconducted in the presence of both male and female bystanders. In this experiment, \nintervention was at its lowest when a man was seen to injure a woman. None of the \nmen intervened, and a lone women tried to stop an attack on another woman. \nIntervention was significantly higher for the men in all other conditions. The authors \nexplained the male bystanders\u2019 failure to intervene to help a female victim by the \n5\npossible 'vicarious sexual or hostile gratification from seeing a man injure a woman' \n(Borofsky et al 1971: 317). In another, similar study Shotland and Straw (1976) \nconducted an elaborate set of experiments in which a man attacked a women in the \npresence of a bystander. In these studies intervention occurred much more \nfrequently when subjects were led to believe that the couple were strangers (65%) \nthan when they were married (19%). In addition, when subjects were unsure about \nthe nature of the relationship they were likely to infer an intimate connection \nbetween the man and the women and thus be less likely to intervene to stop the \nattack. Shotland and Straw (1976) concluded that intervention on the part of a \nbystander was dependent on whether the violence was seen as being part of a \n\u2018domestic\u2019 dispute or not.  Subjects in the \u2018married\u2019 condition claimed that the \nviolence they had witnesses was \u2018a private matter\u2019; \u2018none of my business\u2019 or not \nparticularly serious. This suggests that the perceived relationship between those \ninvolved in the violence had served to \u2018legitimate\u2019 the violence more than would \nhave been the case had the violence occurred between strangers. It also served to \ninterfere with the bystanders\u2019 beliefs about the necessity or legitimacy of \nintervention to help the women.\nIt is clear that from these studies that, by recontextualising the event, an alternative \napproach to the question of bystander intervention becomes possible. This is an \napproach which focusses on the meanings inherent in relationships between men \nand women; the assumptions other people make about the legitimacy of acts of \nviolence between them; and the perceived legitimacy of outside intervention in \nviolent disputes between couples in an intimate relationship. Moreover it is an \napproach which, as will be argued below, can be generalised to include consideration \nof bystander (non) intervention in contexts other than that of a violent attack by a \nman on a women.\nAnalysing non-intervention in the James Bulger murder\nAs has already been outlined above, the murder of James Bulger was preceded by \nhis abduction by two ten year old boys who then walked James across Liverpool for \ntwo and a half hours. During this time they came into contact with (at least) 38 \npeople who were later to give evidence at the trial. None of these bystanders  \nintervened successfully to save James from his fate.  Given Cherry's injunction \nagainst the abstraction of social meaning in explaining intervention, in beginning to \ntheorise about the behaviour of bystanders in the James Bulger murder, three key \n6\nquestions need to be answered. The first of these relates to the perceived \nrelationship between James Bulger and his two ten year old abductors. How did the \nbystanders conceive of the relationship between the three boys? The second \nquestion relates to the way the bystanders viewed their own relationship with the \nboys as they encountered them in different parts of the city. Finally, and given the \nrelationships that the bystanders believed to exist, the third question concerns the \nextent to which intervention was seen as something that was socially appropriate. In \nthe analysis which follows,  the issues which might have been addressed by a more \ntraditional approach to bystander non intervention will also be considered.  This will \ninclude the question of whether the bystanders noticed and interpreted the situation \nunfolding before them as a potential emergency.  The question of whether the \npresence of others was an inhibiting factor on intervention will also briefly be \naddressed. Before beginning the analysis however, it is important to provide more \ndetailed background information not only about about the events surrounding the \nmurder but also about the Court case itself, in order to set the analysis of the 38 \nbystanders evidence in appropriate context.\nBackground to the analysis\nJames Patrick Bulger, aged two years and six months, was abducted from the Strand \nShopping Centre in Bootle, Liverpool on Friday 12 February 1993 at 3:41 in the \nafternoon by two ten year old boys, Jon Thompson and Robert Venables. The \nabduction was captured on close circuit video cameras in the shopping centre. \nThompson and Venables then walked James out of the shopping centre and around \nLiverpool for approximately two and a half hours before murdering him alongside a \nrailway line several miles away from the site of the original abduction. After some \ninitial speculation that the abduction was the work of an adult - or that the two older \nboys had procured James for an adult, Thompson and Venables were identified and \narrested 6 days later and charged with the murder. The trial was heard at Preston \nCrown Court in Lancashire, between Monday 1st November and Friday 26th \nNovember 1993 before Mr Justice Michael Moreland. Under English law the age of \ncriminal responsibility is 10 and the law insists that, where children are accused of \nhomicide, they should be tried before a jury in an adult court. However, at that time, \nas part of a provision known as doli capax, children between the ages of 10 and 14 \ncould only be be convicted of a crime if it could be proved that they knew what they \n7\nwere doing was 'seriously wrong - and not just 'naughty\u20191. Thus, a major part of the \ntrial was concerned with demonstrating that the two ten year olds knew that their \naction was 'seriously wrong' and that they were both mutually responsible. In fact it \nwas a central theme in the prosecution case that both boys had deliberately and with \npremeditation set out to abduct a young child with the aim of murdering him. The \ndefence was one based on mutual antagonism. Each defendant accused the other of \nbeing both the instigator of the abduction and the murderer. In addition, the defence \nset out to show that the abduction was not premeditated, but rather a prank that \nwent disastrously wrong. It was in this context that the 38 witnesses were called to \ngive evidence. The prosecution used the witnesses to show that both boys were \nequally implicated and that their actions revealed them to have premeditated \nmurder in mind. In practice this meant that the prosecution asked the witnesses to \nconfirm that they had seen the boys together; to provide accounts of the two older \nboys\u2019 behaviour which might indicate premeditation and mutual responsibility; and \nfinally to provide identification evidence which would link the two accused to the \ncrime. The defence used the witnesses to attempt to show either that one boy was \nmore responsible than the other, or that the boys\u2019 actions demonstrated that they \nhad no clear plan in mind and were anxious to get themselves out of trouble. It was \nunder this cross examination that the actions of the bystanders themselves \noccasionally became a topic of debate and, as a consequence, where bystanders were \nasked to justify or account for their failure to intervene.\nMaterials and Analytic Background\nThe analysis was carried out on the relevant sections of the transcript of the trial of \nRobert Thompson and Jon Venables for the murder of James Bulger at Preston \nCrown Court, Lancashire, England. The thirty eight witnesses were examined and \ncross examined over a period of four working days from Thursday 4th November \n1993 to Tuesday 9th November 1993. The transcript was provided by the Crown \nCourt Stenographers (Cater Walsh and Co. of Kidderminster, England) and was a \nverbatim account of the proceedings on every day of the trail. As in the case of other \nofficial records of debates and exchanges (eg the Hansard reports of proceedings in \nthe British House of Commons) the transcripts had been tidied up somewhat. There \nis no record of pauses, overlaps or other linguistic infelicities. However, for the \npurposes of this analysis, a verbatim and sequential account is sufficient. The level of \n1 In March 1994 this long standing rule was abolished in the High Court by Lord Justice Mann \n(Young 1996)\n8\nanalysis to which the transcripts were subjected was not at the level of the structure \nof conversation, but rather at the level of the content and deployment of social \ncategories.\nThe preparation of transcripts for analysis follows some of the conventions outlined \nby Potter and Wetherell (1987) for an analysis of discourse. The transcripts relating \nto each of the 38 witnesses were first examined carefully and any extract (including \nthe question which preceded it) that referred to the witnesses observation of, or \ninteraction with the three boys was recorded on a separate card. A distinction was \nalso made between accounts that were given in response to questions from the \nprosecution, and accounts which were given in response to questions from the \ndefence. In the analysis presented below, questions which were asked by Council for \nthe Prosecution will be prefaced by the letters CP. Questions which were asked by \nCouncil for the defendant Thompson will be preceded by the letters CT and \nquestions from Council for Venables by CV. Each witness will be identified by the \norder in which they were called to give evidence (which is also the chronological \norder in which they encountered the three boys) and will also be referred to by their \ninitials to preserve anonymity (eg  B13 (Mrs SD)). \nThe method of data analysis has  much in common with discourse analysis as \nproposed by Potter and Wetherell (Potter and Wetherell, 1987; Wetherell and Potter \n1988, 1992). However, the analysis differs from the procedures they suggest in one \nimportant respect. Their principle concern has been to analyse the usage of various \n\u2018interpretive repertoires\u2019 in \u201cconstructing versions of actions, cognitive processes \nand other phenomena\u201d (Wetherell and Potter 1988, p172). While they do not give \nprecise criteria for distinguishing one repertoire from another, they note that each \nrepertoire tends to derive from one or more key metaphors and can be identified by \ncertain tropes or figures of speech. However, given the aims of this paper, the focus \nof analysis is concerned less with the use of interpretative repertoires and more with \nthe ways in which bystanders invoke particular social categories. In drawing this \ndistinction the analysis follows the argument advanced by  Macnaughten, \n(Macnaughten 1992, Macnaughten et al 1992) that repertoires should be defined in \nterms of the way they define social relations. (For previous examples of such an \napproach in different contexts  see Reicher and Hopkins 1996a, 1996b). This \napproach can also be distinguished from work which is concerned with a more fine \ngrained analysis of the structure and function of language in Court settings \n(Atkinson and Drew 1979). That is not to say that such issues could not fruitfully be \n9\nexplored, but that the concern in this paper is with broader questions of social \nrelations and normative values and the role they play in (non) intervention.  In \nshort, the analysis in this paper will concentrate on three key issues.   The first \nconcerns the way bystanders construct the relationships between the three boys in \nthe evidence they gave to the Court. The second concerns the way  bystanders \nconstruct the relationships between themselves and the three boys in their evidence. \nFinally, there is the question of the  consequences for intervention of the \nconstruction of such social category relationships.\nAnalysis\nBefore we can explore the question of whether  social category relationships played \nan important role in the failure of the bystanders to intervene, it is necessary to \nconsider whether the bystanders had any reason to think intervention might be \nwarranted in the first place. This is also a key question for traditional approaches to \nbystander non intervention. The traditional model suggests that, before a bystander \nwill consider intervention, they must first notice an event and then interpret it as \nsomething which is potentially serious (Latane and Darley 1970). The first issue to be \naddressed in the Bulger case therefore is the question of whether the bystanders \nnoticed that anything was amiss and also interpreted what they saw as something \nthat might require action on their part.\nOne factor which had the potential to be something which bystanders might have \nnoticed and seen as significant was the youthfulness of the three boys and the fact \nthat they seemed to be wondering around the city of Liverpool without adult \nsupervision.  James Bulger was only two and a half years old and the two older boys \nwere only ten years old - and a very young looking ten according to observers at \nthe Crown Court Trial (Smith 1994, Sereny 1996a, Morrison 1997).  The youthfulness \nof the three boys was commented on by some of the witnesses:\nCT: Well, what you saw, you didn't feel that what was happening looked odd or \nunusual [..]\nB7(Mrs PM): I just thought it seemed a bit odd because they seemed too young to be looking \nafter a young boy.\nCT: That was why it was called to your mind?\nB7: Yes\n10\nHowever, this on its own did not seem to be sufficient grounds for intervention. \nWhat seemed to have concerned the witnesses more was a highly visible injury \nwhich James Bulger  sustained during the first thirty minutes of his abduction. The \ncause of the injury was the subject of dispute between the prosecution and the \ndefence, with the prosecution intimating that it was deliberately inflicted whilst the \ndefence maintaining that it might have been accidental.  Whatever the cause, it was \nclear that the injury was clearly apparent to any of the witnesses who were in close \nproximity to the three boys. The injury was first described by the ninth bystander to \nbe called, who came across the boys outside the Strand Shopping Centre about half \nan hour after the abduction. \nCP: And how close, Mrs B, were you to the boys at any time? How close did you get?\nB9(Mrs B): About a couple of yards\n[..]\nCP: Why did the little boy draw attention to the the boys?\nB9: Because he appeared to have a fresh bump on his forehead.\nCP: What sort of bump was it Mrs B?\nB9: It was, it looked as if it had been hurt on the road or something like that.\nCP: Now Mrs B, I\u2019m sorry, it is very difficult to hear what you are saying. Could you \nstart again? I asked you what sort of bump it was.\nB9: It was like a sort of mark that was noticeable, as if it was just done, like little \nspeckly marks but it wasn't bleeding.\nThe testimony of subsequent  bystanders who came close enough to see James\u2019s \nface also made reference to the injury:\nCP: And from where you were, could you see the baby\u2019s face?\nB22 (Mrs IH): Yes\nCP: And what could you see on the baby\u2019s face?\nB22: He was frightened\nCP: Yes, what could you see physically?\nB22: Well, a lump, here, on his forehead\nCP: What about the little boy, did you get a good look at him?\nB27 (Mr FW): Yes\nCP: What did you notice about him?\nB27: I first noticed the grazing on his forehead, the right side of his forehead, a fresh \ngraze.\nCP: Now, did you notice something about James?\nB32(Child E): He had a bump on his left eye\nCP: Bump on his left\/\nB32: Eye, right there.\nCP: Was it above it or below it?\nB32 Above it\nCP: And did you look at the bump that he had, E?\nB32: Yeah\n11\nCP: What did the bump look like?\nB32: It had like blue and red dots in and lines\nIn addition to the people who described the signs of a fresh injury on the two and a \nhalf year old boy, a number of other witnesses spoke of James Bulger\u2019s evident \ndistress:\nCP: And can you tell us how how he was behaving at this stage?\nB6(Mr MW): He was stood still. He was clearly very upset. He was crying his eyes out.\nCP: Now  was he on his own or was he accompanied?\nB6: He was stood on his own but there were two other boys in close proximity to him \nand I believed they were with him.\nCP: Did you notice anything about any one of them?\nB16 (Mr LJ): The small boy was crying\nCP: Can you tell us anything about how the little child looked to you?\nB17 (Mr RJ): He looked upset\nCP:  And what gave you that impression?\nB17: Well he was crying\nFrom this evidence it seems as if the bystanders were aware of the distress and \ninjury to James and also the youthfulness of the three boys.  It seems likely \ntherefore that failure to intervene cannot simply be ascribed to a failure to notice \nthat intervention might be warranted. This then raises the question of what other \nfactors might have played a role in the way bystanders made sense of the situation \nunfolding before them, and how such factors played a part in their failure to \nintervene.\nIt has been argued above that, as in the case of violence between a man and a \nwoman, beliefs about the nature of the category relationship between protagonists \nis crucial to whether bystanders will intervene or not.  Thus, in this analysis, one of \nthe first questions that needs to be asked concerns the beliefs amongst bystanders \nabout the relationship that existed between James Bulger and his abductors. The \ntestimony of 33 of the 38 witnesses dealt at some stage with accounts of interactions \nbetween the three boys. Almost all the the witnesses were asked by the prosecution \nto confirm that they had seen the three boys together. Most of this evidence was in \nthe form of confirmation that they had seen one or both of the older boys holding \nJames\u2019 hand, carrying him or making other physical or verbal contact with him. This \nevidence, in combination with identification evidence, was used by the prosecution \nto link both of the defendants jointly and equally to the abduction and murder. \nHowever, even in the absence of any form of physical or verbal contact between the \n12\nboys it was clear that those bystanders who crossed their path assumed that the \nthree boys were together.\nCP: Did it look as though he was separate to the others?\nB5 (Mr DK): They looked like they  were together just walking up\nCP: Together, but you would say it didn't look as if he was talking to the others?\nB5: No.\nIf the bystanders assumed that the three boys were together, this then raises the \nquestion of what they considered the nature of this relationship to be. In this \ninstance it is clear that the bystanders, when confronted with the three boys,  \nconsidered them to share a category relationship. More specifically, they assumed \nthat the three boys were from the same family -   they assumed they were brothers:\nCP: First of all I am going to ask you what it was that you saw, and then where you \n saw it. Can you tell us please, first of all, what you saw?\nB1(Mrs MK): I saw a little boy apparently two and a half to three years of age ..[..]. He was \nholding, it looked to be a teenager\u2019s hand which I presumed was his older \nbrother. \nCP: What was the next thing you saw Mrs K?\nB3(Mrs K): I thought, I noticed he was on his own and I thought, he is going to look round and \nsay, \u201cwhere\u2019s me mum, I\u2019ve lost me mum?\u201d And I was going to get up out of the \nshop to go to him but then a boy waved him over towards him so I just thought, \n\u201cOh, it must be his brother.\u201d\nCP: And what did you see happen after the little boy had been taken back to the one \nwho had the beige coat?\nB7 (Miss PM): There was talking going on between them but I couldn't hear what they  were \ntalking about, and the little boy didn't appear to be bothered then once he was \nback with his friend, so I just thought it was relatives or brothers or \nsomething.\nCP: And could you see the little lad\u2019s face?\nB14 (Mr MP): Yeah\nCP: Tell us what you saw please.\nB14 It was all bright red and he was crying\nCP: Now, bright red and crying. Now at that stage, what did this group appear to you \nto be?\nB14: Older brothers taking him home.\nIn addition to assuming that the three boys were brothers, bystanders also assumed \nthat the two older boys had been left in loco parentis.  That is, they assumed that the \nparents of the three brothers had left the younger boy in the care of the two older \nboys.  For some bystanders, the encounter with the three boys seemed nothing \n13\nmore than a moment in the return of a distressed younger child to his mother by \ntwo older brothers.\nCP: And where did they seem to be going?\nB13 (Mrs MD): Well, I thought they were going to the Post Office, because the baby was crying. \nI thought they were taking the baby to his mum at the Post office, but they didn\u2019t.\nI overtook them and they turned left at the railings.\nFor other bystanders however, this perceived domestic arrangement was  a source \nof disquiet. One woman, who saw the younger boy being swung vigorously by the \narms between the two older boys, reported to the court that she had shouted out in \nalarm to travelling companions on a bus:\nB11 (Mrs KR): I shouted on the bus sir, I shouted and all the people looked at me and looked to \nthe window as I shouted, and I shouted, \u2018 what kinds of friggin parents have they \ngot, to let them out with a child like that?\u2019 to the man behind me. That's how \ndisgusted I was with them swinging him.\nFor this witness, the behaviour of the older boys called into question the judgment \nof what (she believed to be) the three boys\u2019 parents in giving the older boys such a \nsupervisory role.  The older boys\u2019 behaviour demonstrated their unsuitability to be \ngiven such a role, as they were, in her opinion, behaving in an irresponsible manner.  \nThere is clearly (as the defendants lawyers pointed out in cross examination) a \nquestion of interpretation here. This kind of swinging  by the arms can often be \ndone by parents for for the entertainment of a small child. There is a complex set of \ninterrelationships at work here between the account the witness offers of what she \nsaw; the kinds of category information she uses to make sense of what she saw; and \nthe observed behaviour itself. However, what is clear is that the witness assumes the \nboys are brothers and that the older boys had been given parental responsibility, \neven if they were violating appropriate parental standards.\nFor other witnesses however, assumptions about the parental role of the older boys \nover the younger boy was a function of their apparently responsible behaviour \ntowards the toddler.\nCP: When you saw the three people inside the shop, what did you see about them?\nB29 (Ms MC): The taller of the two boys had hold of the toddler in a way that a parent may \nkeep hold of a child.\nFor this witness, the interaction between older and younger boy reflected both a \nsupervisory relationship and an intimacy which is normally associated with an adult-\n14\nchild relationship. This was the kind of relationship you might expect to find \nbetween an older sibling and a younger sibling who had been left in his charge. The \nassumption about a sibling relationship turns the actions of the older boy into an act \nof \u2018care\u2019  rather than the actions of an abductor who was anxious to monitor the \nbehaviour of his young abductee.  Moreover, it also turns on the idea of control. If \nthe two older boys had been entrusted with a younger charge, and had been given \nparental responsibilities over him, then they hold the right to restrain and discipline \nthe younger child in the same way that any parent would.  Any interactions \nbetween the two older boys and the younger boy  which bystander might witness \nwould therefore be subject to the conventions that usually apply to parent-child \ninteractions. The fact that (even when they involve an adult) these might include \npublic acts of violence including smacking, shouting or pulling, might make such \nactions difficult to challenge when occurring between the three boys.\nThus far it has been argued that the bystanders believed there to be a category \nrelationship between the boys; that the category relationship was one based around \nthe family (the boys were brothers); and that it was assumed that the older boys had \nbeen left in charge of the younger boy.  Further analysis of the transcript material \nseems to suggest that this category relationship may have played an important role \nin the bystanders\u2019 failure to intervene. At the very least, the category of the family \nplayed a central role in the accounts bystanders offered for their failure to intervene. \nFor example, a number of witnesses who acknowledged seeing both the injury and \nthe distress in the face of the younger boy, ascribed their failure to intervene to the \nfact that they assumed the boys were brothers:\nCT: Can I ask you about the little boy? You noticed the graze? You didn't ask the little \nboy how he was and you didn't ask either of the boys how he had come by the \ngraze?\nB28 (Ms FS): No\nCT: It wasn't sufficiently bad, nor was there anything in the boys\u2019 demeanour to cause \nyou to intervene?\nB28: Yes, well I, when the three boys came in I automatically thought they were \nbrothers\nCT: Did you? Why would you automatically think that? I\u2019m sorry I don't want to be \naccused of interrupting you.\nB28: It was just the way they were holding him, maybe he might have run out into the \nroad or run off. I thought that the way they were holding him, they mightn't have \nwanted him to run around the shop\nIn this exchange the witness seems to acknowledge that there might have been \ngrounds for intervention, but explains her failure to act by reference  to the assumed \ncategory relationship between the three boys. It seems from this that, whilst \n15\nrecognising the injury to the younger  child, she considers that the sibling \nrelationship imbues the older boys with both the ability and the responsibility for \ndealing with the problem. Similar assumptions were made by other bystanders who \nactually engaged the three boys in conversation. In the following extract, a women \nwho encountered the three boys while walking her dog, describes a conversation \nshe had with the boys when she was alerted by James\u2019s crying.\nCP: Now, how close did you get to the three of them?\nB22(Mrs IH): I got close to them because, as I am walking my dog around I heard crying and \n[...] I looked over to where the crying was coming from and the two little boys \nwere pulling, as I call, the baby up the slope and as they came a bit further I said \nto them, \u2018What\u2019s the matter\u2019 and one of the other of them said, \u2018Oh he fell down \nthere\u2019, so I said - they are now at the top of the reservoir - so I walked to them \nand said, \u2018 Now look, where are you going now?\u2019  \u201c We are going home\u201d. So at \nthat stage I noticed a huge, big lump on top of the baby\u2019s head, so I said, \u201cYou \nare going home? Well now, look, hurry up and get home and show his mum his \nhead because it\u2019s sore\u2019.\nThis witness seems to begin from the assumption that the three boys are brothers. \nHer response to the account of how James sustained his injuries is not to offer help \nbut rather to enquire what action the two older boys will take next. When she is told \nthat they will be going home, she makes the logical assumption that they will be \ngoing to the same \u2018home\u2019 and that the mother of the three boys will then be able to \ndeal with the injury.\nIn both of the extracts presented immediately above it is possible to imagine that \nintervention might be warranted even though the assumption that the three boys \nwere brothers had been made. After all, there is nothing intrinsic in the assertion of \na sibling relationship which would prevent a competent adult caregiver from taking \ncontrol of all three boys. However, there seems to be something about the quality \nof this particular version of the category of \u2018the family\u2019 that appears to rule out \nintervention on the part of non family members. The fact that this category \nmembership seems to inhibit helping is something that was clearly recognised by \nthe two older boys themselves. On a number of occasions Thompson and Venables \nwere able to deflect bystanders who were on the point of intervention by invoking a \nsibling relationship between themselves and James. The first example comes from \nan exchange described by a witness known as Child E, a boy who knew the \ndefendant Thompson from school but who had not met Venables before. Child E \nwas slightly older than both Thompson and Venables. He begins by saying that he \nwas playing with a friend when the three boys came along.  Child E explains that he \nengaged the boys in conversation, asking who James was and how he sustained his \n16\ninjuries (see previous extract from testimony of Child E (B32) above). Child E was \nclearly aware of the distress and injury to the toddler. In fact he reported trying to \nengage James in conversation but all James could do was cry. This then provoked \nthe exchange described to the Court below:\nCP: Right, now did you know who the little boy was then, on that day when you saw \nhim? Had you ever seen him before?\nB32 (Child E): No\nCP: Did you want to know who he was?\nB32: Yeah\nCP : Did you ask a question about him?\nB32: Yeah\nCP: What did you ask?\nB32: I said, \u2018who is he?\u2019 and he went \u2018Jon Venables\u2019 brother\u2019.\n[..]\nCP: Did you want to know where they were going?\nB32: Yeah\nCP: Did you ask a question?\nB32: Yeah I said, \u2018where are you going?\u2019 and like, they said,\u2019home to Jon Venables\u2019.\nCT: And did you say something about what you wanted to do or what they ought to do?\nB32: I said, \u2018if you don't take him home I\u2019ll batter you\u2019\nCT: Why did you want them to take him home?\nB32: Because to let his mum see his head\nThompson clearly invokes a sibling relationship between James Bulger and Venables \nas a means of deflecting difficult questions. James can\u2019t be Thompson\u2019s  brother \nbecause Child E knows him and his family too well. However as Venables\u2019 brother \nthere is a legitimate reason for James\u2019s presence (he is being looked after by \nVenables) and a slight distancing of responsibility for the toddler. If James is \nVenables\u2019 brother and Child E doesn't know Venables very well, it becomes more \ndifficult for Child E to take responsibility for the smaller boy.  As Venables\u2019 brother, \nhe is really Venables\u2019 responsibility, and all Child E can do is exhort Venables  - and \nthreaten him with violence if he doesn't - to take James home to \u2018let his mum see his \nhead.\u2019\nThis mobilisation of a sibling relationship to prevent intervention is even clearer in \nthe case of an  later interaction with an adult - one of the last people to see James \nalive. On this occasion the boys were in an alley leading towards the railway \nembankment where James was subsequently murdered. Here they encountered  Mr \nWH who was returning from work. It later transpired that Mr WH  knew Robert \nThompson and his family,  but when he encountered the boys Thompson was up on \na ledge leading to the railway line and was thus obscured from view. Venables and \nJames Bulger were in the alley which was on the route to the witness\u2019s home. In his \n17\nevidence Mr WH describes how Venables preemptively introduces the idea that \nJames is his younger brother. In doing so Venables seems to anticipate that \nintervention might be likely, and to inoculate against that intervention by raising a \nsibling relationship between himself and James.\nCP: So, can you describe the person who was on that ledge?\nB36 (Mr WH): No\nCO: No? Age, roughly?\nB36: I couldn\u2019t, he was just in there. As I\u2019m getting up to the little fella, he was sobbing \nand then the other lad spoke to us.\nCP: Who was the lad that spoke to you?\nB36: The one who is standing at the bottom of the entry\nCP: Right, and what was said?\nB36: \u201cI\u2019m fed up of having my little brother\u201d\nCP: I\u2019m fed up with having my little brother\nB36: Yeah. He says, \u201cIt\u2019s always the same from school.\u201d and he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell \nme mum, I\u2019m not going to have him no more.\u201d\n[...]\nCP: And did you then go home?\nB36: Yeah\nIt is clear from the report of this interaction that Venables is anticipating some kind \nof intervention. He volunteers a sibling relationship between himself and James as \nan opening gambit which at the same time closes off a number of avenues of \nenquiry which might be available to Mr. WH. His assertion that he is \u2018fed up of \nhaving my little brother\u2019 who is \u2018always the same from school\u2019, functions as an \nexplanation for the younger boys distress as well as establishing a category \nrelationship that gives him rights and responsibilities over the toddler. This is further \nemphasised by the amplification that he is \u2018going to tell me mum, I\u2019m not going to \nhave him no more\u2019.  In volunteering this final aside to Mr WH, Venables implies \naction to deal with the distressed child.  He will tell his mum that the relationship is \nnot working and that to avoid situations like this in the future the arrangements will \nbe need to be changed.  Thus, in three short and skilful sentences, the likelihood of \nintervention is undermined. A plausible explanation for the toddlers distress is \noffered; a category relationship which binds Venables and James together (and by \nimplication places the bystander outside) is established; and a course of action which \nwill (ultimately) attend to James\u2019 distress is suggested.  In fact Mr WH reported that \nhe never spoke during the interaction and only recalled the meeting four days later \nafter James\u2019s body had been discovered on the railway line.\nTraditional Bystander Intervention Theory and the James Bulger Case\nI have argued in this paper that failure of bystanders to intervene in the James \n18\nBulger case was  a function of  the  assumption that the boys were brothers. This \nassumed category relationship had consequences for the way bystanders \ninterpreted what they saw and also inhibited their willingness or ability to help. The \nfact that such a categorisation would inhibit \u2018non family\u2019 members was clearly \nrecognised by the two older boys who used it to deflect intervention on a number of \noccasions. Before drawing out some of the implications of these arguments for the \nquestion of bystander intervention in general,  it is important to compare how a \nmore traditional bystander intervention theory perspective might account for the \nevents in this case. There are clearly a number of difficulties in attempting this kind \nof comparison.  Most of the traditional work on bystander intervention is made up \nof either laboratory based experiments or quasi-experimental field studies. Under \nsuch conditions a number of key variables can either be controlled or measured \naccurately.  For example, we have already seen that the question of the presence or \nabsence of other bystanders is of central concern to the traditional approach to \nbystander intervention. It is predicted that people are more likely to help when they \nare on their own than when they are in the presence of other bystanders. However, \nthe data provided by the transcripts makes it difficult to recover information about \nnumbers of other people present with a high degree of certainty. It is possible \nnevertheless to make a number of suppositions based on the evidence which is \navailable in this case. For example, we know that James was abducted in a shopping \ncentre (mall) at a busy time of day. He was also walked along the streets of \nLiverpool during rush hour. Those people who came across the three boys in the \nshopping centre or on the street are likely to have done so in the presence of other. \nIt also seems to be the case that at least three (and possibly four) of the bystanders \ncame across the three boys in the absence of others. These include bystanders who \nmet the boys on open ground or in small alleys and who reported that nobody else \nwas present. As none of the bystanders was able to intervene successfully it seems \nreasonable to assume that the presence or absence of others may not have played a \ndetermining role in this case. In addition, none of the bystanders made mention of \nthe presence or absence of others as a factor in their behaviour.  At the same time, \nalmost all of the bystanders spoke of their belief about the family status of the three \nboys instead.  Thus, in this particular case, a social categorisation perspective seems \nto have more utility than an approach based on the effect of the presence of other \npeople. Of course, this raises the issue of whether what people say can be taken as a \ntransparent indication of the factors which impinged upon their decision making. It \nmay be that they were not aware of the influence of the presence of others;  were \nunable to articulate the effect of the presence of others; or failed to mention it for \n19\nfear of exposing themselves to social sanction.  However, even with these \nreservations in mind, and given both the data available and the principles of \nparsimony, it seems that a social categorisation account of the bystanders behaviour \nmay be more persuasive in this case.\nAn examination of the performance of the traditional five step model of bystander \nintervention in accounting for the behaviour of the bystanders in the Bulger case is \nalso illuminating.  The traditional model proposes that bystanders pass through five \nsteps of evaluation on the way to intervention. These include noticing the event; \ninterpreting the event as an emergency, assuming personal responsibility; feeling \ncompetent to help; and then helping.  This paper has already presented evidence \nwhich argues that the first two steps of the model would have been satisfied by \nbystanders in this case. The bystanders noticed James and the two older boys and \ninterpreted James\u2019 distress and injuries as the signs of a potential emergency. It is at \nthe proposed third stage of the model that difficulties arise. The model suggests that \nan evaluation of personal responsibility is required before intervention will be \ncontemplated. The most likely reason for failure of an individual to intervene is \nattributed to the phenomenon of \u2018diffusion of responsibility\u2019 or what has been \ntermed \u2018pluralistic ignorance\u2019. It is argued that bystanders assume that, when others \nare present, those other people will know what to do and will do it.  In the absence \nof others, the opportunities to defuse responsibility is reduced and bystanders are \nmore likely to take the responsibility on their own shoulders and thus intervene.\nWe have already seen that reliable data on the physical presence or absence of \nothers is difficult to ascertain in this case. However, from the evidence which is \navailable from the transcripts, it seems that the way in which the question of \npersonal responsibility is resolved may be more complicated than the traditional \nmodel proposes.  The evidence from this paper suggests that the traditional model  \nmay be right to stress the importance of the presence of others in how people make \nsense of the situation - but that it does not go far enough.  In particular, the \ntraditional model does not distinguish between categories of bystanders -  \nsomething which is clearly important in this case. For example, it can be seen that, \nfor most of the witnesses, there were at least two categories of potential bystander. \nThe first category of bystander  would have been the two ten year old children who \nhad abducted James. As far as the witnesses were concerned, at the time of the \nencounter, these were simply  two boys who were aware of James\u2019 distress.  The \nsecond category of bystander would have been other adults who witnessed  the \n20\nscene ( in the Strand Shopping Centre or on the streets of Liverpool).  The principles \nof diffusion of responsibility  suggest that responsibility will be diffused equally \nacross both the children and the other adults. Both would simply be treated as \n\u2018bystanders\u2019. However, there is a clear difference between these two categories of \nbystanders. The two children were only ten years old, and as has already been \nestablished, looked young for their age. Had the witnesses seen them as \u2018young \nchildren\u2019 then it seems logical to assume that the witnesses would have felt greater, \nrather than less responsibility for James. The fact that witnesses seemed to assume \nthat they could be treated as the equivalent of competent adults is something which \nis in need of explanation - and was crucial in the failure of bystanders to intervene in \nthis case.  It is because the three boys were categorised as \u2018family members\u2019, and not \n\u2018children\u2019, that the two older boys could be treated as the equivalent of competent \nadults. As it stands, the traditional model would not sensitise us to the importance of \nthe way social category relationships were constructed and resolved in this case. In \nurging us to look simply at the presence of others, rather than who we believe those \nothers to be, the traditional model may be missing some of the most important \naspects of the process of bystander intervention. \nMoreover, by considering the category relations between boys and bystanders (and \nthe social meanings associated with them) another possibility emerges. It is equally \npossible that the bystanders did feel personal responsibility  but were unable or \nunwilling to intervene in the affairs of another family. There is much evidence to \nsupport this proposition in the data. For example, a number of bystanders made \ninitial moves to intervene, suggesting that they did feel some personal \nresponsibility. However, the fact that they were deflected by the explicit \nintroduction of a family relationship between the three boys, seems to suggest that \nit is something about the quality of the category relationship and the meanings \nassociated with it which is preventing intervention. In these terms, failure to \nintervene can be seen not as the product of degradation of feelings of individual \nresponsibility brought on by the presence of others, but as a socially meaningful act \nin its own right. It may be that bystanders were aware not only of the right to \nprivacy but also of the sanctions which can follow violations of the boundaries of the \nmodern family, and it was such considerations which inhibited intervention.\nOne of the key features which emerges from the attempt to apply traditional \nbystander theory to the James Bulger case is the absence of a concern with \ncategorical relations and how they effect the judgments and actions of bystanders. \n21\nMoreover, traditional bystander theory  seems to underplay the importance of the \nsocial norms which guide both the interpretation of events and also decisions about \nthe legitimacy of intervention. It seems that the traditional approach may  have \nbecome  overly reductionist in restricting consideration of the impact of the social \nmilieu on bystander intervention to the question of whether the presence of others \ninduces diffusion of responsibility and hence leads to apathy. In order to develop a \ndeeper (and perhaps more practically useful) understanding of bystander \nphenomenon it is important to incorporate consideration of the social world as a \nmore \u2018positive\u2019 influence in shaping both interpretation and action in helping \ncontexts.\nDiscussion\nThis paper has argued for an approach to the study of bystander intervention \nphenomenon based on an analysis of the construction of social categories in local \ncontexts.  More specifically, it has proposed that the failure of bystanders to \nintervene in the James Bulger murder was a function of the perception that the three \nboys were brothers.  The fact that bystanders believed, or were told, that the three \nboys shared a social category relationship as members of the same family served to \ninhibit or deflect intervention. It has also been argued that traditional approaches to \nthe question of bystander intervention are unable to to account for the behaviour of \nbystanders in the James Bulger case. It is suggested that the difficulties faced by the \ntraditional model can be traced to limitations in theorising about the role of social \nnorms and values in the way bystanders evaluate events and make decisions about \nintervention. By focussing on the impact of the presence of others the traditional \nmodel ignores the social meanings which attend not only to the way events might \nbe perceived but also to the decision to intervene.\nGiven the explanation for the actions of bystanders which is advanced in this paper, \na number of questions remain to be answered. The first question relates to the \nimpact of the category of \u2018the family\u2019 on this case.  Why should the belief that the \nboys were brothers make intervention difficult?  While a full answer to this question \nis beyond the scope of this paper, some preliminary observations can be made. For \nexample,  there is much evidence that the modern family has become an \nincreasingly atomised unit (Stone 1977;  Sennett 1984). At the same time over the last \ntwo decades there has been a rekindling of interest in what might be called the \npolitics of the family (Abbot and Wallace 1992; Jones and Millar 1996). This work \n22\nidentifies  \u2018the family\u2019  as a key preoccupation of  conservative political movements  \nin both Europe and the United States. The major ideological thrust of these \nmovements is to prioritise the rights and responsibilities of families over the role of \nthe State and civil society. It may be that there have been some unintended \nconsequences of this shift of emphasis. For example, it may be that this more \nprivatised view of the family has led to an increasingly  insular perspective on the \nresponsibilities of adults towards children who are not family members. In short, \ndespite the signs of visible injury to a two and a half year old boy, and the \ncomparative youth of the boys he was with, assumptions of their family status may \nhave served to detach the bystanders from the children. In addition, during the last \ntwo decades there has been a heated debate about how the government and society \nshould respond to problems related to child abuse and child care (Parton 1991). \nThere have been high profile deaths of children from violence and neglect as well as \nthe \u2018discovery\u2019 of child sexual abuse as an important social problematic (Howitt 1992, \nStainton Rogers and Stainton Rogers 1992).  This increased public awareness of  (or \nat least discussion about) threats to children has occurred alongside anxieties over \nchild abduction and child murder.  This combination of factors has led to a climate of \nsuspicion in which non-family adults are seen as the biggest threat to the safety and \nsecurity of children. This fear persists despite the evidence that the vast majority of \nphysical and sexual crimes against children are committed by family members \n(Creighton 1992, Waterhouse 1993). Bystanders may have been deflected from \nintervening in the James Bulger case by the fear that, as non family members, their \nintervention might have been viewed with suspicion.\nThe second question which needs to be addressed concerns the qualities of the data \nwhich are utilised in this paper and the nature of the theoretical claims which can be \nbased upon it. The evidence presented here, and on which the theoretical arguments \nare made, are retrospective accounts made by witnesses in a particular legal context.  \nIt is clear that witnesses could be reconstructing events in ways which favour them, \nabsolve them from blame and so on. In addition it may be that there were other \nfactors that influenced their  behaviour which would be difficult to voice publicly. \nFor example, it would be very difficult for any bystander to have told the Court that \nthey did not intervene to help a distressed two year old boy who was subsequently \nmurdered, because they were too busy.  It is clear therefore that we cannot treat the \naccounts offered by the bystanders  simply as transparent reflections of their \nunderlying psychological state at the time they encountered the three boys. What is \nbeing argued in this paper is that a failure to intervene on the grounds that  the boys \n23\nwere assumed to be brothers is something which is generally recognised  as a \nlegitimate reason for non intervention.  In these terms, failure to intervene can be a \nsocially meaningful act. This approach contrasts with more traditional perspectives \non bystander intervention which tends to see failure to intervene as a sign that an \nindividual\u2019s decision-making ability has been impaired by the \u2018social impact\u2019 of the \nphysical presence of others (Latane 1981). It is an approach which requires the \ninclusion of bodies of evidence and questions which are normally excluded from \ntraditional social psychological work on bystander intervention. By recontextualising  \nthe  analysis of the behaviour of the bystanders (rather than concentrating on \nwhether there are people present or not) different questions emerge. The first \nrelates to the social and cultural categories which inform behaviour. The second to \nthe way these categories are invoked or negotiated in particular local contexts. The \naim of the present paper has been to show how elements in both of these areas \ncontributed to the failure of bystanders to  intervene in the Bulger case. By moving \naway from a focus of the numbers of people present and towards an examination of \nthe social category relationships and the norms and values associated with \nintervention, we may be able to gain a deeper understanding of the factors which \nunderpin bystander intervention.\n24\nReferences\nAbbot, P. and Wallace, C (1992) The family and the new right.
