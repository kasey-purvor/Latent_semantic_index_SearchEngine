Hydroacoustics (2002 to 2004) and long-term oxygen data (1969 to 2004) have \nbeen used in conjunction to examine the habitat of Arctic charr in the north and south \nbasins of Windermere, U.K., a temperate lake subjected to cultural eutrophication and \nsubsequent nutrient management. \n2. Since 1969 there has been a gradual decline in the oxygen concentration in the \nbottom waters of both basins of 0.03 \u2013 0.04 mg L-1yr-1, resulting in up to 43 % of the \nvolume of the south basin having an oxygen concentration < 5 mg L-1 in the early \nautumn.  \n3. Hydroacoustic data indicate that most Arctic charr routinely avoid the upper 10 m \nof the water column irrespective of temperature, with the implication that an observed \ngradual warming of the lake has not yet directly impacted upon their habitat. \n4. In recent years there has been a behavioural response of the Arctic charr population \nto migrate vertically to avoid oxygen concentrations < 2.3 to 3.1 mg L-1. Further, the \ndepth of the lower bound of the Arctic charr population is shown to be highly \ncorrelated with the deep water oxygen concentration throughout the year prior to \nautumnal overturn. \n \n \n \n \n 2\nIntroduction \nThe availability of oxygen, together with water temperature on which it is partially \ndependent, has been acknowledged as one of the most important abiotic \nenvironmental characteristics affecting the distribution of freshwater fish at the habitat \nscale (e.g. Rudstam & Magnuson, 1985; Spoor, 1990; Kalikhman, Walline & Gophen, \n1992; Swierzowski, Godlewska & Poltorak, 2000; Burleson, Wilhelm & Smatresk, \n2001; Klumb et al., 2004; Larsson, 2005). Despite this widespread influence, the \neffects of this factor are taxa-specific to the degree that while many cyprinids and \nsome percids can tolerate relatively low levels of dissolved oxygen, salmonids require \nsignificantly higher availabilities (Alabaster & Lloyd, 1980). In lake habitats, \nsalmonids such as Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)) may consequently be amongst \nthe species most sensitive to deteriorating oxygen conditions which typically \naccompany eutrophication. In addition, this holarctic species can also be expected to \nbe impacted by further reductions in oxygen availability which are anticipated under \nclimate change, particularly in the hypolimnia of productive systems (Carpenter et al., \n1992). \n \nWindermere is the largest natural lake in England and, like many other large \ntemperate lakes, has a long history of cultural eutrophication and subsequent nutrient \nmanagement (reviewed by Pickering, 2001). Following increases in nutrients in the \nlake\u2019s north and particularly south basins between the 1940s and the late 1980s, when \nsubstantial deepwater anoxia became a recurring problem in the south basin during \nthe late summer and autumn, phosphate stripping was introduced to local sewage \ntreatment works in 1992 (Elliott & Reynolds, 1996). One of the main drivers behind \nthis action was concern over the lake\u2019s populations of Arctic charr. In an early \n 3\napplication of hydroacoustic techniques in 1988, Mills et al. (1990) observed that \nArctic charr were displaced from the deepest areas of the south basin at a time when \nlocal oxygen levels were low. \n \nIn addition to supporting a small semi-commercial fishery (Mills, 1989), the Arctic \ncharr of Windermere has a great importance for local tourism arising from its national \nrarity and perceived indication of a healthy environment. The local stocks also have a \nlong-standing interest for evolutionary biologists because they comprise autumn- and \nspring-spawning sub-populations in both basins (Partington & Mills, 1988), while the \nspecies is recognised to hold significant biodiversity conservation value at a national \nlevel (Maitland et al., 2007). On the basis of these attributes and the observations of \nMills et al. (1990), the Arctic charr of both basins have been monitored by monthly \nhydroacoustic surveys since 1989 (Winfield, Fletcher & James, 2007a). To date, \nanalyses of these hydroacoustic data have been restricted to changes in population \nabundance (Elliott et al., 1996), horizontal distribution (Baroudy & Elliott, 1993) and \nsurvey design (Winfield, Fletcher & James, 2007b), that is, no further studies of \nvertical distributions in relation to oxygen concentration beyond the limited \nobservations of Mills et al. (1990) have been undertaken. \n \nIt is unclear precisely what lower level of oxygen concentration will impact Arctic \ncharr populations in terms of either direct mortality or restrictions in habitat use. \nLaboratory experiments on young Arctic charr from Windermere (Baroudy & Elliott, \n1994) revealed that incipient lethal levels of oxygen (i.e. survival over seven days) \nwere as low as 1.8 to 2.0 mg L-1 at low acclimation temperatures (5 and 10 oC) and \n 4\n2.2 to 2.4 mg L-1 at higher acclimation temperatures (15 and 20 oC). Such values are \nsimilar to a threshold of 1.8 to 1.9 mg L-1 reported for the congeneric brook trout \n(Salvelinus fontinalis Mitchill) by Shepard (1955), but lower than values reported for \nrelated Salmo species (see Baroudy & Elliott (op. cit.)) leading Elliott & Baroudy \n(1995) to conclude that Arctic charr are amongst the most tolerant of salmonids to low \noxygen levels. Such laboratory experiments cannot, of course, address the more \ncomplex issue of habitat avoidance due to low oxygen levels. \n \nThe aims of this study were to combine results from long-term dissolved oxygen \nprofiles of the north and south basins of Windermere with more recently acquired fish \nvertical distribution data to assess changes in oxygen concentrations and to investigate \ntheir impacts on habitat availability for Arctic charr. \n \n \nMethods \n \nWindermere is situated in the English Lake District in the north-west of the country at \napproximately 54.5oN, 3oW. It is a mesotrophic, lowland, valley lake surrounded by \nfells of a few hundred metres height. The lake comprises two basins, one to the north \nand one to the south of a shallow sill populated with islets approximately halfway \nalong the length of the lake. The north basin of Windermere has a surface area of 8.05 \nkm2 and a maximum depth of 64 m, while the south basin covers 6.72 km2 and \ndescends to a maximum of 42 m; the bathymetry of both basins being detailed by \nRamsbottom (1976). The fish community is relatively simple with the only species of \nnumerical importance being Arctic charr, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), brown \ntrout (Salmo trutta L.), European eel (Anguilla anguilla (L.)), perch (Perca fluviatilis \n 5\nL.), pike (Esox lucius (L.)) and, in recent years, roach (Rutilus rutilus (L.)), although \nPickering (2001) notes the presence of a further nine minor species. \n \nOxygen concentrations and temperatures have been monitored in both basins of \nWindermere since June 1968. Initially this routine monitoring took place every week, \nbut in 1980 monitoring in the winter was changed to once every two weeks, and in \n1992 and onwards all monitoring has been at a frequency of once every two weeks. \nMeasurements were routinely taken at the surface and the bottom and at a varying \nnumber of depths in between. Typically measurements were tightly spaced through \nstratification in order that the temperature measurements accurately resolved the \nthermocline, but less tightly spaced when the lake was isothermal and the oxygen well \nmixed. To avoid any inherent biasing from this spatial and temporal variation, the \ndata have been linearly interpolated on to a 1 m resolution daily grid prior to analysis. \nMeasurements were originally taken with an YSI model 58 sonde (YSI, Yellow \nSprings, Ohio, U.S.A.) and latterly with a WTW Oxi 340i probe (WTW, Weilheim, \nGermany). \n \nFor each day the volume of water in the south and north basins that had an oxygen \nconcentration less than 5 mg L-1 was calculated. By comparing with the total volume \nof the basin and averaging over each month of each year the average monthly \npercentage of the basin with water less than 5 mg L-1 was calculated. Similar \ncalculations were done for the percentage of water with an oxygen concentration less \nthan 3 mg L-1 and less than 1 mg L-1. \n \n 6\nDay and night hydroacoustic surveys of Windermere have been conducted at \napproximately monthly intervals since 1989 as part of an Arctic charr monitoring \nprogramme (see Winfield et al., 2007a). However, data appropriate for detailed \nvertical profile analysis have only been collected since January 2002, following \nupgrade of the hydroacoustic system to a BioSonics DT6000 echo sounder (BioSonics \nInc, Seattle, U.S.A.). This system was subsequently upgraded to a BioSonics DT-X \necho sounder in November 2004, although with no implications in the context of the \npresent study.  Accordingly, three years of hydroacoustic data were used here: 2002, \n2003 and 2004. Throughout the surveys, the 200 kHz transducer (beam angle 6.5\u00b0) \nwas mounted at 0.5 m below the lake surface, the data threshold was set at -70 dB, the \npulse rate was set at 5 pulses s-1 with a width at 0.4 ms and data recorded from a range \nof 2 m from the transducer. For the present study, data were taken from single \ntransects nearest the deepest areas of each of Windermere\u2019s two basins. For the north \nbasin this transect ran from 54\u00b0, 23.480\u2019 N, 2\u00b0, 56.330 W to 54\u00b0, 24.030\u2019 N, 2\u00b0, \n57.550 W, while for the south basin it ran from 54\u00b0, 18.950\u2019 N, 2\u00b0, 57.340 W to 54\u00b0, \n18.050\u2019 N, 2\u00b0, 57.070 W. Of a theoretical total of 144 such transects (36 months x two \nbasins x day and night), 13 transects were lost, primarily due to adverse weather \nconditions, leaving an actual total of 131 transects (91%) available for analysis. \n \nSubsequent data analysis in the laboratory was performed by fish tracking using \nSonar5-Pro Version 5.9.6 (Lindem Data Acquisition, Oslo, Norway, \nwww.fys.uio.no\/~hbalk\/sonar4_5) with a target threshold of -70 dB. For \nhydroacoustic data files collected before 1 January 2004 and for which GPS data were \nnot directly available, this information was later added using Sonar5-Pro as described \nby Balk & Lindem (2006). Data analysis involved the water columns of each transect \n 7\nbeing divided into 1 m deep strata from a depth of 2 m below the transducer down to \nthe lake bottom. Fish population densities expressed as individuals per 1000 m3 \n(converted to individuals ha-1 of lake surface area in some analyses \u2013 see results) for \neach transect were exported via the Winfield table function of Sonar5-Pro to a \nspreadsheet for further analysis including combination with oxygen concentration \ndata. Estimates of target strengths produced by Sonar5-Pro were converted to fish \nlengths using the relationship described by Love (1971): \n \nTS = (19.1 log10 L) \u2013 (0.9 log10F) \u2013 62.0, \n \nwhere TS is target strength in dB, L is fish length in cm and F is frequency in kHz. A \nbreakpoint of \u201343 dB was used to pool targets into two length classes of less than and \ngreater than 200 mm. The above calculations of fish population densities were thus \nproduced for both length classes and for total fish for each basin and for day and night \nof each month. \n \nIn addition to Arctic charr, significant numbers of small individuals of other species \nless than 200 mm in length are also seasonally present in the pelagic upper waters of \nWindermere (Winfield & Durie, 2004;  CEH, unpublished data).  Consequently, \nsubsequent analyses combining hydroacoustic and environmental data were \nperformed only for individuals of at least this length to ensure that they were based \nexclusively on Arctic charr. Using the bathymetry of Windermere, population \ndensities were also converted to absolute numbers of individuals present in each depth \nstratum. These absolute population distributions were then used to calculate, for each \ntransect, the depths at which 90% of the population was situated below or above the \ndepth stratum; hereafter referred to as the lower and upper 90% bounds of the Arctic \n 8\ncharr vertical distributions. These parameters gave a more robust measure of the \nvertical distributions of fish than that produced simply by the minimum and maximum \nrecorded fish depths.  \n \n \nResults \nBetween 1969 and 2004 there has been a significant reduction in the annually \naveraged oxygen concentration in the bottom water of both basins of Windermere \n(Fig. 1a,b). In the north basin this decline has been at the rate of 0.030 mg L-1yr-1, \nwhile in the south basin a somewhat higher rate was noted (0.042 mg L-1yr-1). Oxygen \nconcentrations have also typically been absolutely higher in the north basin than in the \nsouth basin throughout this period.   \n \n In the south basin, from January to the end of May, there were no occasions when the \nmonthly average oxygen concentration was < 5 mg L-1. In June and December there \nwas only one occurrence each month and in July there were nine occurrences. For \nAugust, September, October and November there have been a number of years in \nwhich the monthly average oxygen concentration has been below 5 mg L-1, 3 mg L-1 \nor even 1 mg L-1 (Fig. 2a\u2013d). Although in the late 1960s and early 1970s virtually the \nwhole basin had an oxygen concentration > 5 mg L-1, in the 1980s much of the basin \nsuffered severe oxygen depletion, with portions of the basin regularly experiencing < \n1 mg L-1 in the early autumn. In years immediately following upgrading of sewage \ntreatment works in early 1992, the percentage of the basin with low oxygen \nconcentration was considerably reduced. Subsequently, however, the volume of water \nwith a low oxygen concentration has increased, with the largest volume of water with \n 9\na concentration < 5 mg L-1 since monitoring began occurring in September 2002 (43 \n%). The volume of low oxygen concentration water tends to be highest in September \nand October, shortly before the autumnal overturn. Since 1992, the percentage volume \nof water in October with an oxygen concentration < 3 mg L-1 has been increasing at a \nsignificant rate of approximately 1.5 % yr-1. \n \nIn the north basin, only a few occasions with oxygen concentrations < 5 mg L-1 were \nnoted. An average monthly concentration < 5 mg L-1 was recorded somewhere in the \nbasin for a total of nine months during the 1980s and for five months post 2000. Thus, \nwhilst there are signs of a recent increase in volume of low oxygen concentration \nwater in the north basin, in comparison to the south basin the basin is relatively well \noxygenated. \n \nIn the south basin, despite warming in the summer, the 16 oC isotherm rarely \npenetrated below 10 m, and the 12 oC isotherm was never lower than 20 m during \n2002, 2003 and 2004 (Fig. 3a,b,c). Both the annual pattern of depleted oxygen \nconcentration and the seasonal positioning of the upper and lower 90% bounds of \nArctic charr were broadly similar each year (Fig. 3a,b,c). The lake was fully mixed \nthroughout the winter, but routinely stratified between approximately April and \nNovember. Oxygen concentrations correspondingly declined in the hypolimnion to a \nminimum in autumn, shortly before overturn. It is notable that the lower 90 % bound \nexhibited the same trend each year, increasing from about 35 m in early summer to \nabout 25 m in autumn. Another common trend was that the upper 90 % bound was \nrarely < 10 m depth, even during the isothermal hibernal months. Moreover, there is \n 10\nsome indication of the upper 90 % bound increasing in tandem with the lower 90 % \nbound.  \n \nIsotherms in the north basin showed similar trends to those in the south but, despite \nbeing a deeper basin, oxygen concentrations were rarely < 5 mg L-1 (Fig. 4a,b,c). The \nlower 90 % bound was typically a few metres deeper in the water column than the \ncorresponding bound in the south basin, but there was a less pronounced elevation in \nthe bound through the summer and autumn. Once again the upper bound was almost \nalways beneath 10 m depth throughout the year. \n \nThe average depths of the lower and upper 90% bounds of Arctic charr vertical \ndistributions over the three years showed a clear increase in the lower bound between \nwinter and autumn in the south basin, but less of an increase in the north basin (Fig. \n5a). There was also a systematic greater depth of the lower bound in the north \ncompared to the south basin. Though the average bound range over the three years \nwas usually greater in the north than in the south basin, in neither basin was there an \nobvious systematic seasonal change in bound range (Fig. 5b). The average depths of \nthe lower and upper bounds were 30.8 m and 15.9 m, respectively, in the south basin \nand 37.1 m and 16.3 m, respectively, in the north basin, leading to average band \nwidths of 14.9 m in the south and 20.8 m in the north basins. \n \nAn indication of the oxygen concentrations that Arctic charr avoid in the south basin \ncan be estimated from the minimum concentration of the interpolated oxygen data that \nthe lower 90 % bound reached on a day when a hydroacoustic survey was carried out. \n 11\nThis was 2.3, 2.7 and 2.7 mg L-1 in 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively, and in all three \nyears occurred in October. Alternatively, the minimum preferred oxygen \nconcentration can also be estimated from the monthly averaged concentration of \noxygen at the depth the lower 90 % bound reached in October each year; using this \nmethod gave values of 2.8, 3.0 and 3.1 mg L-1 for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004, \nrespectively. However, this latter method is likely to overestimate minimum \nconcentration as it is based on a monthly average rather than a daily concentration and \ndoes not rely on temporal interpolation. The corresponding values for the north basin \nwere somewhat greater compared to the south basin, namely 6.0, 6.2 and 5.7 mg L-1 \nfor 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. \n \nOxygen concentrations for each month averaged from 2002 until 2004 at the depth of \nthe annually averaged lower 90 % bound of Arctic charr vertical distributions (31 m \ndepth in the south basin, 37 m depth in the north basin) were very similar in the two \nbasins at the beginning of the year, but started to diverge in May (Fig. 6). Both \nshowed a pattern of declining oxygen concentration until late autumn, followed by a \nsteep increase. In the south basin the decline was much greater than in the north basin. \nThe standard deviation of this monthly oxygen concentration was always small, with \nthe exception of the oxygen concentration in the south basin in November when \noverturn occurs and concentrations consequently rapidly shift from near anoxia \ntowards the hibernal maximum. \n \nDepths of the lower 90 % bound of Arctic charr vertical distributions each month \naveraged over the three years were correlated with the corresponding monthly \n 12\naveraged oxygen concentration at the annual average depth of the lower bounds (Fig. \n7). Only the pre-overturn months of January to October have been included in this \nFigure, as adult Arctic charr move to shallow waters in the late autumn to spawn and \nalso at this time there is a radical change in the oxygen concentration at depth (Fig. 6) \nresulting from the autumnal overturn. The oxygen concentration at the average depths \nof the lower bounds were chosen as being indicative of the ambient oxygen \nconcentration experienced by fish at depth in the lake.  \n \nDiscussion \nThis study has clearly shown that the vertical distribution of Arctic charr in \nWindermere is significantly influenced by the availability of oxygen in the lower \nhypolimnion, particularly in the more nutrient-enriched south basin. The present \nfindings also show that, despite the introduction of phosphate stripping in early 1992 \nand a subsequent initial improvement in water quality, the lake has not since \nrecovered to the conditions observed in the 1960s. Indeed, recent measurements \nindicate further decreases in oxygen concentrations. This decline in oxygen \nconcentration at depth, particularly in the south basin, signifies a potential loss of \nhabitat volume for the Arctic charr. In theory, changes in the algal community, in lake \ntemperature or in the duration of stratification could have effected this depletion. \n \nOne oxygen threshold for Arctic charr habitat relates to the minimum oxygen \nconcentration which the Arctic charr can endure for prolonged periods of time. In the \nperiod 2002 to 2004, the lower 90 % bound of Arctic charr vertical distribution was \nobserved at a minimum oxygen concentration of c. 3 mg L-1 in the south basin, \n 13\nallowing for uncertainties in the interpolation of the oxygen data. This suggests that, \nin the wild, the Arctic charr of Windermere will avoid spending prolonged periods in \nwater below this oxygen concentration. This range is noticeably similar to the values \nobserved in laboratory experiments on incipient lethal oxygen concentrations of \nindividual Windermere Arctic charr parr carried out by Baroudy & Elliott (1994), but \nslightly below the avoidance level of 4 mg L-1 reported by Spoor (1990) for \nfingerlings of the closely related brook trout. A conservative approximation, \ntherefore, to the recent (1992 \u2013 2004) rate of Arctic charr habitat decline is shown by \nthe volume of water with a concentration < 3 mg L-1 in October to be 1.5 % yr-1. \n \nMoreover, our results indicate a tendency for Arctic charr to seek more oxygenated \nwaters by upward migration even when ambient oxygen concentrations are high. For \nexample, we noted that the vertical distribution of Arctic charr in the south basin \nbegan in early spring, when oxygen concentrations were still well above incipient \nlethal levels. Although oxygen concentration is clearly not the only driver of \npositioning in the water column, the correlation that we noted in the south basin \nbetween oxygen at depth and Arctic charr positioning suggests that oxygen \nconcentration is of considerable importance. Despite this increase in the lower 90% \nbound of Arctic charr vertical distributions, the upper bound rarely increased above a \ndepth of 10 m in either basin. This suggests that avoidance of surface waters is \nanother strong driver of Arctic charr positioning in the water column, irrespective of \nlocal oxygen concentrations. The near-surface distributions of Arctic charr may also \nbe influenced by changes in basin-specific zooplankton abundances and distributions, \ngiven the dominance of such prey in their diet (Frost, 1977). Unfortunately, \nappropriate long-term zooplankton spatial distribution data are not available for \n 14\nWindermere. Furthermore, any such influences may have recently been dramatically \nchanged by the expanding epilimnetic population of roach (Winfield et al., 2007a) \nand their predatory impacts on cladoceran zooplankton. Consequently, this issue \nremains unresolved although its potential importance is acknowledged.  \n \nIn addition to eutrophication, another potential threat to the habitat of the Arctic charr \nin Windermere is a changing climate, which has recently warmed the lake above its \nlong-term average (Winfield et al., 2004). Mills et al. (1990), following Elliott (1981), \nsuggested the preferred maximum temperature for Arctic charr was 16 oC and thus \nany deepening of this isotherm as the lake warmed could potentially restrict available \nhabitat.  In a more extensive study based on Arctic charr from eleven widespread \nEuropean locations, Larsson et al. (2005) similarly found maximum growth to occur \nbetween 14.4 and 17.2 oC.  In Windermere, the position of the upper 90 % bound for \nArctic charr habitat was rarely above 10 m depth in either basin during the years 2002 \nto 2004 and so crossed the 16 oC isotherm only occasionally. However, Larsson \n(2005) reported notably lower actual preferred temperatures for Arctic charr from two \npopulations in Sweden of 10.8 and 11.8 oC. Similarly, Mortensen, Ugedal & Lund (in \npress) observed a population in northern Norway to prefer a temperature of 11.5 to \n11.8 oC from spring to autumn and then 8.7 oC in winter. Irrespective of whether \nArctic charr in Windermere also occupy this preferred lower temperature range or \nthey indeed inhabit warmer water allowing maximum growth rate, water at 10 m is \nstill sufficiently cool to be inhabitable. Moreover, for the time being, the Arctic charr \ncan still rise through the water column in the late summer, without needing to inhabit \nthe top 10 m. Therefore, whilst there has been a significant rise in the surface \ntemperature of Windermere with implications for littoral fish species (Winfield et al., \n 15\n2004), the increases in temperature have not yet directly impacted on the volume of \nhabitat available to the Arctic charr. However, as changing temperatures and \nstratification are known to have other effects on lake ecosystems (Elliott, 1996; \nWinfield et al., 2004; Elliott, Jones & Thackeray, 2006; Madgwick et al., 2006; \nWinfield et al., 2007a), an indirect but still significant impact upon the Arctic charr \ncannot be discounted. \n \nThe data presented in this paper have a number of implications. Firstly, despite \nphosphorus striping there has been a decline in oxygen concentration in England\u2019s \nlargest lake. Secondly, recent hydroacoustic data suggest that, with the known \nexception of a brief inshore spawning season when mature individuals visit shallow \nareas (Kipling, 1984), the majority of the adult Arctic charr stay below the upper 10 m \nof the lake. As such, it is unlikely that the direct effects of climate warming have \ndirectly impinged upon this species. However, studies by Nakano, Kitano & Maekawa \n(1996) concerning the potential loss of habitat for the closely related Dolly Varden \n(Salvelinus malma (Walbaum)) and white-spotted charr (Salvelinus leucomaenis \n(Pallas)) of the Japanese archipelago and by Janssen & Hesslein (2004) for the closely \nrelated lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush (Walbaum)) in temperate zone lakes, clearly \nindicate the potential scope of this threat. Thirdly, while the combined oxygen \nmeasurements and hydroacoustic data suggest that Arctic charr populations in \nWindermere will avoid areas with oxygen concentrations which previous laboratory \nexperiments have shown to be approaching lethal levels (Baroudy & Elliott, 1994), \nthey also suggest sensitivity to all levels of oxygen. This was most apparent in the \nsouth basin of Windermere where a vertical migration was shown to begin in the \n 16\nspring as oxygen concentrations declined in the deep waters following the onset of \nstratification. \n \nAlthough this study has exclusively addressed the Arctic charr populations of \nWindermere, our findings have a wider relevance given that Maitland et al. (2007) \nrecognised eutrophication and climate change to be two of the major threats facing the \nconservation of this species elsewhere in the British Isles. The same threats are \nimportant on a global basis; both to the Arctic charr and to its congeners (see Magnan \net al., 2002). With specific respect to climate change, in their examination of the \npotential effects of this threat on fish habitats including that of the closely related lake \ntrout in temperate zone lakes, Janssen & Hesslein (2004) noted that the impact of \noxygen deficits on habitat availability will be influenced by lake trophic status. In this \ncontext, the extensive datasets on Arctic charr vertical distributions and associated \nenvironmental parameters available for Windermere offer an invaluable opportunity \nfor further studies of the detailed interactions between oxygen availability, water \ncolumn temperatures and habitat use by this ecologically and economically important \nspecies. \n 17\nAcknowledgments  \nWe would like to thank our colleagues Janice Fletcher, Ben James, David Abel, Mitzi \nDe Ville, Jack Kelly, Paul Hodgson and others for undertaking the hydroacoustic and \nenvironmental surveys which underpinned this work.
