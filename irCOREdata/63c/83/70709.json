This article examines the effects of role on terrorists\u2019 use of power and affiliative\nstrategies in negotiation as a function of terrorist ideology, incident type, and the outcome that\nis achieved. Data were scores on eight behavioral scales designed to reflect the dynamics of 186\nterrorist negotiations, as reported in detailed chronological accounts. Results supported the\nhypothesized one-down effect with terrorists\u2019 use of power-oriented strategies complemented\nby authority\u2019s use of affiliation-oriented strategies. The extent to which terrorists used aggres-\nsive strategies was related to the resolution of the incident, with attenuated outcomes more likely\nfor those using more aggressive strategies. These dynamics differed across incident type, with\naerial hijackings involving more overt power strategies than barricade-siege incidents, which\nwere more likely to involve bargaining for certain outcomes. Finally, terrorist ideology and the\nassociated identity concerns magnified the one-down effect, with religious fundamentalists\nengaging in more violence and less compromising strategies than terrorists with other ideo-\nlogical backgrounds.\nKeywords: role, one-down effect, power, affiliation, complementarity, terrorism, ideology.\nIn a recent paper, Donohue and Taylor (2003) reviewed seven lines of research\nthat provided data about the effects of role on strategy use in negotiations.\nCentral to each line of work was evidence for a one-down effect. Specifically,\nnegotiators who saw themselves as having fewer options than their opponents\nwere more likely to resort to aggressive strategies as a way of seeking change\nin the power structure. The emphasis of these negotiators\u2019 dialogue was on\ndefending a personal position by attacking the other party\u2019s social legitimacy\nand attempting to force the other into unnecessarily yielding on critical issues.\nIn contrast, negotiators who perceived themselves as having a greater number\n527\n* William A.

TAYLOR\nof options were less threatened by the power structure of the situation and, con-\nsequently, were more likely to risk their social identity with affiliative and con-\nciliatory dialogue. In other words, the role associated with the less powerful,\n\u201cone-down\u201d position typically fostered use of competitive, aggressive mes-\nsages as a means of shifting power, even though that strategy can be least effec-\ntive in reaching agreement (Levine and Boster 2001).\nThe purpose of this article is to explore this effect in the context of terror-\nist hostage-taking and negotiation. Data used to examine the role effect were\nderived from 186 descriptive accounts of terrorist incidents collected from the\nchronologies compiled by Mickolus and his colleagues (Mickolus 1980, 1993;\nMickolus, Sandler, and Murdock 1989; Mickolus and Simmons 1997). The\naccounts selected contained sufficient descriptive material to enable a coding\nof the power and affiliative behaviors that occurred during the incidents as well\nas a coding of the way in which the incident ended. Of greatest interest are role\ndifferences exhibited by the various kinds of terrorists involved in these inci-\ndents. To understand these role differences, this article begins with a review\nof the literature that is perhaps most informative about the terrorist negotiation\ncontext. The article then considers these findings in the theoretical framework\nof the one-down effect, and uses this review to form hypotheses about the\neffect of role on terrorists\u2019 behavior and incident outcome.\nHostage Negotiation Research\nEarly research into terrorist hostage-taking highlighted the interdependence\nbetween parties\u2019cooperative and aggressive behavior and how this influences\nthe dynamics of incidents. For example, Corsi (1981) used decision trees to\nshow that acts of force by both terrorists and authorities can influence the\nresponse of the other party, as well as shape how the incident unfolds. By sys-\ntematically modeling these relationships, other researchers (e.g. Sandler and\nScott 1987) have noted the importance of complementary and reciprocal\ndynamics in the bargaining process between terrorists and authorities. As\nmight be expected, these dynamics also associate differently with the possible\noutcomes of terrorist incidents. For example, in their descriptive analysis of\npolitically motivated attacks, Friedland and Merari (1992) found relationships\nbetween factors such as the degree terrorists were armed and their subsequent\ncommitment to the act. Finally, in developing this research from a psycho-\nlogical script perspective, Wilson (2000) highlighted the importance of nego-\ntiators\u2019 identity, as measured by differences in terrorist group, on the type of\nbehaviors terrorists are prepared to use and the outcomes that they achieve.\nMore direct evidence of how role influences these behavioral relations\nIN_8,3_f6_527-547  6\/24\/04  14:22  Page 528\nTESTING THE ROLE EFFECT IN TERRORIST NEGOTIATIONS 529\ncomes from research that focuses on the various language strategies used in\nhostage negotiation. For example, Donohue and Roberto (1993) studied com-\nmunication strategies across 10 actual incidents in which police negotiators\ntalked to hostage-takers with a variety of different role backgrounds (i.e.\nexperienced criminals, mentally disturbed, domestic problems). The results\nindicated that the police negotiators controlled the amount and pace of the dis-\ncussions and the topics that were considered. The police were also more\nlikely than the hostage-takers to use collaborative relational messages that\nshow support and provide information, whereas the hostage-takers were\nsignificantly more likely to use power strategies such as threats, demands, and\nlanguage containing negative affect. Thus, while police negotiators sought to\ncontrol interactions by controlling the emphasis on dialogue, they also recog-\nnized the need for affiliative messages to manage the disparity in power be-\ntween the two parties.\nRogan and Hammer (1994) used another set of hostage negotiations to\nexplore the importance of identity or facework in negotiations. Facework\nfocuses on the issue of controlling one\u2019s identity and threatening the others\u2019\nidentity in an attempt to alter the individual\u2019s view of him or herself as being\ncompetent and in control of the situation. Rogan and Hammer discovered that\nthe police negotiators relied heavily on trying to restore the hostage-taker\u2019s\nface (i.e. used language to portray the hostage-taker in positive terms) while\nthe hostage-takers relied more on restoring their own face or making them-\nselves look strong and in control. Thus, the perpetrators were much more\nfocused on defending their own identities than the police negotiators, who\nshowed little concern for personal identity and concentrated more on trying to\nsupport the perpetrators\u2019 identities.\nIn further exploring the importance of identity within role differences,\nDonohue and Roberto (1996) found that the hostage-takers in authentic con-\ntexts used more distributive or power-seeking strategies, made more demands,\nand proposed fewer integrative or win-win options than the hostage-takers or\npolice negotiators in simulated contexts. Although these simulations were con-\nducted by actual police negotiators, the role effect was not as significant as that\nfound with actual hostage-takers, presumably because negotiators in simulated\nsessions have a lower commitment to their identity. The actual hostage-takers\nwere significantly more interested in protecting their identities than individu-\nals in any other category of negotiation.\nThe possibility of role orientations influencing negotiators\u2019 language choices\nis also evident in Taylor (2002a), who showed that messages typically orient\naround avoidance (withdrawn), distributive (competitive) and integrative (co-\noperative) approaches to interaction. Taylor argued that these broad orienta-\ntions emerge from negotiators\u2019 interpersonal predispositions and personal\nIN_8,3_f6_527-547  6\/24\/04  14:22  Page 529\n530 WILLIAM A. DONOHUE AND PAUL J. TAYLOR\nrole expectations in the conflict, and showed that their characteristic behaviors\nformed a single dimension running from extreme crisis to normative problem\nsolving. Consistent with Donohue and Roberto (1993), Taylor demonstrated\nthat those negotiators holding firm to specific orientations tend to use com-\nmunication behaviors that seek to aggressively increase power or concede\npower to open dialogue to more normative problem solving. Moreover, Taylor\nfound that negotiators generally adopt consistent orientations to instrumental\n(task-focused), relational (trust and liking-focused), and identity (identity or\nface-focused) concerns at any one time, reasserting the central importance of\nroles to many aspects of negotiation dynamics (Wilson and Putnam 1990).\nTheoretical Explanations for the One-Down Role Effect\nBased on this hostage negotiation research and findings from other contexts\nreviewed by Donohue and Taylor (2003), it appears that negotiators who see\nthemselves as having fewer options in comparison to their opponents often\nseek to regain power through competitive, attacking dialogue, even though that\nstrategy can be least effective in reaching agreement (Levine and Boster\n2001). Hostage-takers, buyers, union negotiators, low-power political groups\nand husbands in a divorce negotiation rely on more power-oriented messages\nto promote a more competitive and more power-focused negotiation context.\nThe emphasis of their dialogue is on gaining control in the interaction by\nattacking the other party\u2019s social legitimacy and attempting to force the other\ninto unnecessarily yielding on critical issues. In contrast, the hostage nego-\ntiators, sellers, management negotiators, high power international negotiators,\nand wives use a broader range of communication choices including more\naffiliative and interest-focused messages. Because these negotiators have\nmore options available that do not impinge on their overall position, they feel\nable to risk their social identity with more open and conciliatory dialogue.\nThe regulation of control and its attendant focus on power is an often used\ntheoretical tool for explaining negotiation processes (Bacharach and Lawler\n1986) as well as behavior in other interpersonal contexts (Bales 1970; Leary\n1957; Mahalik 2000; Schmidt, Wagner, and Kiesler 1999). For example, the\nconcept of losing control is the most widely accepted explanation for domes-\ntic violence in which violence emerges as a strategy for regulating control that\nhas been threatened in some way (Eisikovits, Goldblatt, and Winstok 1999).\nAccording to this perspective, the extent to which the regulation of control\nbecomes necessary depends on the prominence of identity. For violence to\nemerge there needs to be a high degree of concern and commitment to the\nsocial and personal identity that underlies an individual\u2019s position. Individuals\nIN_8,3_f6_527-547  6\/24\/04  14:22  Page 530\nTESTING THE ROLE EFFECT IN TERRORIST NEGOTIATIONS 531\nmust value their identities, integrate them into all aspects of their social life,\nand work to defend them often. In order to defend their identity, individuals\nmust also recognize norms and values in the social context that sanction vio-\nlence as an acceptable and appropriate means of restoring one\u2019s identity.\nBeing competitive and power-focused, or integrative and affiliation-focused,\nmust be viewed as a normatively-sanctioned strategy for identity management.\nFinally, individuals need to frame situations in a way that calls for the use of\nviolence or power strategies. That is, they must work to actively structure the\nsituation so that power, threats, or violence are viewed as a legitimate response\nto that situation. Thus, for negotiators whose personal or professional lives\ngrow from their identity as competent negotiators, situations that threaten con-\ntrol need to be perceived in such a way that power messages are seen as a legit-\nimate way of responding to restore identity. The focus is on the identity and\non the legitimization of force to restore it.\nThe importance of regulating control and power suggests that achieving\nsymmetrical power may reduce the magnitude of the one-down effect. Pfetsch\nand Landau (2000) focus on the effect of power symmetry in international\nconflict. They contend symmetry is a necessary but not sufficient condition for\nsuccessful negotiations. Properties of symmetry\/asymmetry largely describe\nthe relative potential power and strength of parties and thus power-role status.\nPatterns of role behavior along these dimensions are seen in the process of\nnegotiation \u2013 lower-power parties will seek to negotiate on equal terms as the\nstronger party by cultivating non-material resources (e.g. actor, joint, proce-\ndural, issue-related techniques, etc.). Again, the lower-power party is likely to\nconcentrate more on non-substantive issues as a means of equalizing power\nand reestablishing identity. In this context, police negotiators often talk about\nthe need to quickly restore the hostage-taker\u2019s identity as a means of focusing\non substantive issues (Donohue, Kaufmann, Smith, and Ramesh 1991).\nHowever, role differences can also emerge from non-identity based biases\n(see Putnam and Holmer 1992 for a review). For example, Neale, Huber and\nNorthcraft (1987) found that the assignment of negotiator roles, such as seller\nor buyer, was sufficient to cue gain and loss frames. Negotiators playing the\nrole of sellers tend to view an outcome as a potential gain (i.e. those in an offen-\nsive role), and typically make more concessions and engage in more informa-\ntion seeking behaviors than buyers who tend to hold a negative frame. Negative\nframes are linked to escalation of conflict, potential impasse, strikes, and\nthird party intervention. Negotiators entering interactions with negative frames\nare somewhat more likely to engage in defensive facework and somewhat less\nlikely to engage in protective facework than are people entering negotiations\nwith cooperative frames. For example, research indicates that buyers are more\nlikely to have a negative frame than sellers, which is consistent with evidence\nIN_8,3_f6_527-547  6\/24\/04  14:22  Page 531\n532 WILLIAM A. DONOHUE AND PAUL J. TAYLOR\nsuggesting that buyers typically use more distributive behaviors than sellers\n(Drake 2001; Morley and Stephenson 1977).\nThe notion that power and expectations interact is evident in Olekalns and\nFrey\u2019s (1994) study of buyer-seller negotiations, in which framing was shown\nto be exaggerated by differences in power. High power positively framed and\nnegatively framed negotiators are significantly advantaged by an imbalanced\nnegotiation market in their favor. The interaction between expectations and\nperceptions of power may also account for the longer term oscillation between\nintegrative and distributive behavior use reported by Druckman (1986).\nEvidence suggests that expressions of positive affect reverse the one-down\nphenomenon, prompting bargainers with positive frames to take advantage\nand engage in more risk seeking, more non-agreement, and less concession\nmaking than negotiators with negative frames. In other words, when a nego-\ntiator in a powerful offensive role perceives significant benefits to using the\npower, they may well use their advantage. This prompts an aggressive counter-\nresponse from the low-powered defender, which in turn forces the offensive\nnegotiator to adopt more cooperative strategies to avoid a crisis or breakdown\nof the interaction. This pattern of interdependence may presumably continue\nindefinitely, so long as interactions do not cross a threshold of extreme hostility\nthat leads to a breakdown irrespective of any subsequent cooperation (Taylor\n2002b).\nUsing the Role Effect to Understand Terrorist Negotiations\nThis review suggests that the one-down role effect of increased aggression dur-\ning negotiation revolves around three key issues. First is the issue of power\ncomplementarity. In comparison to the other party, terrorists find themselves\nin a role that imposes more constraints on their ability to control the negotia-\ntion process and attain their desired outcomes. This reduced power places the\nterrorist in a one-down position that becomes more prominent over time as\nauthorities develop tactical and negotiation positions. The response of many\nterrorists is to adopt this one-down position and threaten or actually use vio-\nlence to generate fear, coercion, or intimidation in an effort to realign the bal-\nance in power (Russell, Banker, and Miller 1979). However, not only is the\npower structured differently, but also the strategic responses to the discrepancy\nare typically complementary. That is, the one-up party (e.g. the authorities)\ngenerally responds to this discrepancy with less aggression and more affilia-\ntive strategies.\nHowever, associated with the one-down effect is a limit to power comple-\nmentarity that comes in the form of attenuated outcomes. If terrorists adopt a\nIN_8,3_f6_527-547  6\/24\/04  14:22  Page 532\nTESTING THE ROLE EFFECT IN TERRORIST NEGOTIATIONS 533\ncooperative orientation to interaction, then the parties are able to develop nor-\nmative dialogue that retains power complementarity and achieves better out-\ncomes. In contrast, terrorists that adopt the one-down position are less likely\nto secure their desired outcomes because the increased aggression discourages\nthe one-up party (i.e. authorities) from helping the other maximize gains. In\nparticular, when the one-down party\u2019s behavior becomes extreme, then the\none-up party often withdraws affiliation in favor of more aggression (Alex-\nandroff 1979).\nSecond is the prominence of identity. For individuals more committed to\nsustaining their role identities for their professional or personal pursuits, such\nas terrorist and police negotiators, a key goal is to vigorously defend that pub-\nlic identity. Central to the beliefs and attitudes that form the terrorists\u2019 identity\nis an ideology (Crenshaw 1988; Hoffman 1999). A terrorist\u2019s ideological per-\nspective provides a set of beliefs about the external world that not only fosters\nan identity around commitment to a cause, but also shapes expectations about\nthe rewards of terrorism and dictates the extent to which the terrorists\u2019 goals\nare dependent on the cooperation of the authorities.\nAlthough every terrorist has an individual identity, researchers have\nidentified three major ideological perspectives (Hoffman 1999; Post, et al.\n2002). The nationalist-separatist seeks to establish a geographically separate\npolitical state based on either ethnic or political criteria (e.g. Irish Republican\nArmy, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine). These terrorists are\noften accountable to a developed criminal organization and are both trained\nand experienced in the terrorist role. The ideology itself is generally an\nextreme example of the beliefs and backgrounds of the immediate social\ngroup, such that these communities treat the role of terrorist with respect and\nimportance (Silke 2003). However, because the community\u2019s beliefs also dic-\ntate the legitimacy of the terrorism, violence is typically planned, only used as\nnecessary, and more likely to be directed away from harming innocents.\nThe social revolutionist uses terrorism as a way of drawing attention and\napplying pressure on the authorities to promise changes in social or economic\norder (e.g. Japanese Red Army). These terrorists necessarily possess a degree\nof interdependence with the authorities because their goals focus on fighting\nfor improvement or change in a system of which they are already part. By\nusing the threat of killing hostages as a bargaining tool, these terrorists expect\nto force authorities to compromise on a position or make concessions in sup-\nport of their cause. However, since one of their aims is to gain support for the\nrevolution, they are likely to avoid levels of aggression that would serve to\nreduce the publics\u2019 sympathy (Wilson 2000).\nRadically different from the two secular groups is religious fundamentalist\nterrorism, which is viewed as a \u201csacramental act\u201d carried out in fulfillment of\nIN_8,3_f6_527-547  6\/24\/04  14:22  Page 533\n534 WILLIAM A. DONOHUE AND PAUL J. TAYLOR\nsome theological order (Hoffman 1999). While the focus of secular terrorists\nis on using terrorism to change some aspect of the current political or social\norder, the religious terrorist seeks to cause damage directly to a society. Their\nrole is one of an extreme martyr figure who, in making an honorable sacrifice,\nwould expect to receive both social recognition and rewards in the afterlife\n(Silke 2003). This set of goals means that religious terrorists have a clear out-\ngroup mentality and are likely to show little interdependence with authorities\nor hostages. They consider themselves as being at \u201ctotal war\u201d, such that\ngreater use of violence is not only morally justified but a necessary expedient\nfor the attainment of their goals (Hoffman 1999).\nThe third issue is individual bias from situational, task, and frame perspec-\ntives. The one-down role effect appears most likely to emerge when a number\nof individual biases start to develop. For example, when individuals define the\ntask as revolving around a single issue they remove options for more collab-\norative trade-offs and more nuanced views of the conflict. Also, more aggres-\nsive strategies emerge when individuals perceive that violent means of\naddressing the issues are socially sanctioned, and they enter the conflict with\na fixed sum bias and a negative frame. As noted by Corsi (1981), the propen-\nsity for these dynamics to emerge will vary across the types of terrorist inci-\ndents, since each type differs in terms of its setting, the available possibilities,\nand the way in which the interaction is played out. In this study, where the data\nare aerial hijackings and barricade siege incidents, these differences are likely\nto affect the degree terrorists use power-gaining and affiliative strategies.\nSpecifically, the mobile nature of some aerial hijackings means that they are\nassociated with extreme time-critical interactions, where the traditional attri-\ntion approach to negotiation is not necessarily appropriate or possible. In such\ncontexts, negotiators often focus on the prominent alternative and take a more\naggressive approach to interaction in an effort to reach a conclusion (Donohue\net al. 1991). Moreover, the confined context of the aerial hijacking may lead\nhostage-takers to perceive themselves as being under greater threat from tac-\ntical strategies. Again, the response is to use power strategies that make overt\nthreats in an attempt to discourage such actions.\nHypotheses\nTo test the role effect in the terrorist negotiation context it is useful to focus on\nthe power and affiliation negotiation strategies displayed by terrorists and their\nnegotiation counterparts. These strategies are coded in the incident reports\nused as the dataset for this study. Power moves are defined as aggressive\nattempts to gain leverage in the incident. Affiliation moves are defined as direct\nIN_8,3_f6_527-547  6\/24\/04  14:22  Page 534\nTESTING THE ROLE EFFECT IN TERRORIST NEGOTIATIONS 535\nattempts to cooperate and bargain for suitable outcomes.\nBased on these concepts and the issues that drive the one-down effect we put\nforward the following hypotheses:\n\u2022 H1: Terrorists who reject the one-down role effect and rely more on affilia-\ntion moves by spending more time negotiating and showing a willingness\nto make concessions are more likely to secure their desired outcomes.\n\u2022 H2: Terrorists who respond with the one-down effect will resort to power\nstrategies as a way of seeking change in the power structure and are less\nlikely to secure their desired outcomes.\n\u2022 H3: Religious fundamentalist-oriented terrorists who are more personally\ncommitted to their identities are more likely than the other two terrorist\ngroups to resort to power strategies as a means of seeking change in the\npower.\n\u2022 H4: Aerial hijackings are more likely to involve overt power strategies\ncompared to barricade-siege incidents, which are more likely to involve\nbargaining for certain outcomes.\nMethod\nData Sample\nData were 186 descriptive accounts of terrorist incidents collected from the\nchronologies compiled by Mickolus and his colleagues (Mickolus 1980, 1993;\nMickolus, Sandler, and Murdock 1989; Mickolus and Simmons 1997). The\naccounts selected contained sufficient descriptive material to enable a coding\nof behaviors that occurred during the incidents as well as a coding of the way\nin which the incident ended. 100 of these accounts were aerial hijackings in\nwhich the perpetrators took control of an airplane or helicopter for a sustained\nperiod of time. The remaining 86 accounts were barricade-siege incidents in\nwhich the perpetrators took control of a public building (e.g. embassy) or a pri-\nvate location (e.g. bank). The selected incidents took place between 1968 and\n1991, and were located in over 50 different countries. The incidents were\nreportedly committed by both autonomous perpetrators and perpetrators\naffiliating themselves with known terrorist organizations including the Black\nPanther Party, Islamic Jihad, the Irish Republican Army, and the Popular\nFront for the Liberation of Palestine. These affiliations allowed the incidents\nto be grouped according to whether they were associated with a nationalist-\nseparatist, social revolutionary, or religious fundamentalist ideology (Post \net al. 2002).\nIN_8,3_f6_527-547  6\/24\/04  14:22  Page 535\nA content analysis of the descriptive accounts revealed a number of vari-\nables that reflected overt power moves and affiliative acts within the terrorist\nincidents. These behaviors were identified through a grounded approach to cat-\negorizing descriptions in which the coding scheme was continually expanded\nand refined until it effectively reflected the behavior of both terrorists and\nauthorities (Glaser and Strauss 1967; Holsti 1969; Krippendorff 1980). The\nbehavioral variables were scored in a dichotomous format as either absent \n(or information missing) or present across all of the 186 incidents. This\nmethod of analyzing the data was adopted following previous research\nfindings (Taylor, Bennell, and Snook 2002; Wilson 2000) that show a dichoto-\nmous approach as effective in producing interpretable results from descriptive\nmaterial whilst minimizing the opportunity for subjective and unreliable cod-\ning of the data.\nThe behavioral variables were found to form eight scales on which the ter-\nrorist incidents could differ. These scales focused on differences in negotiation\nbehavior, but also reflected the other actions used by parties within the broader\ncontext of the terrorist attack. Table 1 reports the final eight scales with a\ndefinition of the categories that constitute each scale. Four of the scales depict\npower moves and were scored such that higher scores reflect more aggressive\nattempts to gain leverage in the incident. For example, the Control scale\ndepicts terrorists\u2019 treatment of their hostages during the incident and runs from\nno attempt to control to killing of a hostage. Two of the scales depict the degree\nof affiliation shown by the terrorist and are scored with higher scores reflect-\ning more direct attempts to cooperate and bargain for a suitable outcome. \nFor example, the Negotiate scale runs from no dialogue to conciliation and so\ncaptures the extent to which terrorists are prepared to engage in substantive\nproblem-solving. The remaining two outcome scales reflect the actions of the\nauthorities in response to the terrorists. The Force scale measures the extent\nto which authorities carried out tactical behaviors beyond negotiation, with\nhigher scores representing the use of more aggressive strategies during the\nincident. The Capitulation scale depicts the extent to which authorities com-\nplied with terrorists\u2019 demands and goals and was calculated so that higher\nscores reflect larger concessions.\nReliability of the transcript coding was assessed by having one independent\ncoder apply the coding dictionary to descriptions of the aerial hijackings and\na second coder apply the scheme to the barricade-siege incidents. The reliabil-\nity of coding, measured at the individual behavior level with Cohen\u2019s Kappa\n(Cohen 1960), was .64 with 75 percent agreement for the Control scale (Range\n= .52 \u2013 .82); .87 with 92 percent agreement for the Damage scale (Range = \n.76 \u2013 .94); .74 with 76 percent agreement for the Demands scale (Range = \n.55 \u2013 .85); and .84 with 91 percent agreement for the Use of weapons scale\n(Range = .83 \u2013 .87). The two affiliation scales showed similar levels of relia-\n536 WILLIAM A. DONOHUE AND PAUL J.

Finally, the reliabilities of the outcome scales were\n.79 with 88 percent agreement for the Capitulation scale (Range = .62 \u2013 .95)\nand.67 with 83 percent agreement for the Force scale (Range = .60 \u2013 .76).\nAccording to Fleiss (1981), a Cohen\u2019s Kappa of .40 to .60 is fair, .60 to .75 is\ngood, and greater than .75 is excellent. Thus, these results indicate that the\nscales developed from the coded descriptions of the incidents are reliable.\nResults\nA preliminary analysis of the interdependence among the scales revealed a\npositive correlation for power (Mean r = .23) and a positive correlation for\naffiliation (Mean r = .30), but no relationship between power and affiliation\n(Mean r = .03). The small correlation between the power and affiliation meas-\nures was principally due to the power-orientated Demand scale, which corre-\nlated positively with both of the affiliation scales (Mean r = .30). Recalculating\nthe correlation between the power and affiliation scales with the Demand \nscale removed revealed a negative relationship between the two dynamics \n(r = \u20130.37).\nTo test Hypotheses 1 and 2 that examine the impact of the terrorists\u2019behav-\nior on the incident resolution, we correlated the power and affiliation scales\nwith the two outcome measures. Table 2 presents non-parametric correlations\n(Spearman\u2019s rho) that were calculated without taking into account cases in\nwhich both scale scores were zero (i.e. no behavior occurred). This modi-\nfication is a common approach to dealing with accounts where the absence of\na given behavior may not be taken as a definite indication that the behavior did\nnot occur but only that it was not reported as having occurred. By ignoring\njoint non-occurrences, the correlations minimize the possible error created by\nthis ambiguity and so are likely to provide a more accurate picture of the inter-\nrelationships among behaviors (e.g. Bennell and Canter 2002; Taylor, Bennell,\nand Snook 2002).\nConsistent with predictions, the data presented in Table 2 indicate that the\nuse of power and affiliation behaviors by terrorists have quite different asso-\nciations with the degree that authorities capitulate. Of the power-orientated\nstrategies, violently controlling hostages, damaging the building or aircraft,\nand extensively using weapons were all associated with lower levels of con-\ncessions from the authorities. The exception to this trend was the correlation\nfor the Demand scale, which suggested a positive relationship between mak-\ning more demands and concessions by the authorities. In contrast to the over-\nIN_8,3_f6_527-547  6\/24\/04  14:22  Page 538\nTESTING THE ROLE EFFECT IN TERRORIST NEGOTIATIONS 539\nall negative correlations associated with the power scales, terrorists\u2019 use of\naffiliation strategies correlated positively with authorities\u2019 behavior. Both\nincreases in terrorists\u2019willingness to negotiate and their willingness to give up\nhostages were significantly associated with more concession-making by the\nauthorities. Thus, consistent with Hypothesis 1, negotiators who take a more\nproblem-orientated approach to the negotiation achieved better outcomes.\nCorrelations in the second column of Table 2 test the hypothesis that ter-\nrorists\u2019 use of aggressive behavior will influence the way authorities respond\n(Hypothesis 2). The correlations indicate that terrorists\u2019 use of aggressive\nstrategies had a mixed effect on whether or not the authorities reciprocated\nwith force. Specifically, higher levels of controlling behavior and weapon use\nwere both related to greater use of force by the authorities, but the opposite was\nthe case for the Damage and Demand scales. This suggests that the authorities\nmay respond to attempts to gain power with personal aggression, but only after\nthe occurrence of certain types of behavior, and not to a significant degree. In\nparticular, only scores on the Control scale showed a significant correlation\nwith the Force scale, which is consistent with the view that authorities will\nresort to aggressive tactics if hostages are being physically harmed or killed\n(McMains and Mullins 2001). This is a key exception to the role effect. The\neffect generally reveals a complementary behavioral pattern with the one-\ndown participant demonstrating increased aggression while the one-up respon-\ndent is generally more affiliative. In the case of response to extreme terrorist\npower strategies, respondents appear to engage in reciprocal rather than com-\nplementary behavior.\nTable 2.

DONOHUE AND PAUL J. TAYLOR\nConsistent with the expected complementary behavioral pattern of the role\neffect, the relationship between terrorists\u2019 use of affiliative behaviors and\nauthorities\u2019 use of force was overwhelmingly negative. Both a greater will-\ningness to negotiate and a greater willingness to release hostages showed a\nsignificant negative association with the Force scale, suggesting that the\nauthorities were unlikely to use aggressive strategies when terrorists\u2019were not\nacting to change the power structure of the situation.\nExamining Hypothesis 3, Table 3 reports the mean score for each of the\npower and affiliation scales as a function of ideology, where the highest mean\nscore is shown in bold. Consistent with Hypothesis 3, religious fundamen-\ntalists showed greater levels of aggressive strategies than both nationalist-\nseparatist and social revolutionary terrorists on all but the Demand scale.\nSpecifically, non-parametric one-way ANOVA\u2019s (Kruskal-Wallis 1952) rev-\neled significant differences among the three groups in the degree of violence\ntowards hostages, H (2,183) = 9.59, p < .05, the degree of damage during the\nincident, H (2,183) = 7.49, p < .05, and the use of weapons during the inci-\ndents, H (2,183) = 13.17, p < .05. For all three scales, post-hoc comparisons\n(Marascuilo and McSweeney 1977) revealed that religious fundamentalists\nused significantly higher levels of aggression than social-revolutionists\n(respectively, c = 37.8, 30.5, and 40.6, p < .05) and higher but non-significant\nlevels of aggression compared to nationalist-separatists (respectively, c = 20.9,\n15.5, and 21.3, p > .05). In terms of affiliative behavior, there was a significant\ndifference among terrorist groups in their willingness to conciliate, H (2,183)\n= 11.21, p < .05, with religious fundamentalists being significantly less \nlikely to release hostages compared to nationalist-separatists (c = \u221241.0, p <\n.05) and social revolutionists (c = \u221221.7, p < .10). There were no significant\ndifferences across the three ideologies in the willingness to use negotiation \n(H < 1, ns).\nFinally, the predicted differences (Hypothesis 4) among aerial-hijackings\nand barricade-siege incidents were examined by calculating the mean score for\neach of the power and affiliation scales as a function of incident type. Table 3\ngives these means and reports in bold the larger of the scores between barri-\ncade-siege and hijacking incidents. A series of Mann-Whitney U tests across\nincident type revealed that aerial hijackers were significantly more likely to\ninflict damage to the incident location compared to perpetrators of barricade-\nsieges (U = 3441.0, z = \u22122.63, p < .05) and that hijackers had a non-significant\ntendency to make greater use of their weapons than barricade-siege perpetra-\ntors (U = 4035.0, z = \u22120.82, p > .05). In contrast to the hijackers focus on vio-\nlence, perpetrators of barricade-siege incidents typically asserted power\nthrough verbal demands (U = 3546.0, z = 2.19, p < .05). They also showed a\nnon-significant tendency to support these demands by threatening and carry-\nIN_8,3_f6_527-547  6\/24\/04  14:22  Page 540\nTESTING THE ROLE EFFECT IN TERRORIST NEGOTIATIONS 541\ning out threats on the hostages compared to hijackers (U = 3894.0, z = 1.17, \np > .05). Consistent with this focus, barricade-sieges involved significantly\nmore negotiation than aerial hijackings (U = 3545.0, z = 2.15, p < .05) and\nwere significantly more likely to involve the release of hostages than aerial\nhijackings (U = 3291.5, z = 2.92, p < .05).\nDiscussion\nThe data generally provide support for the three key dimensions of the one-\ndown effect in the context of terrorist negotiation: a) complementary strategy\nTable 3.

DONOHUE AND PAUL J. TAYLOR\nuse with the one-down party behaving more aggressively and, as a result,\nachieving attenuated outcomes, b) the prominence of identity that can magnify\nthe role effect, and c) the impact of situation on individual biases that affect the\ndegree and type of behavior.\nSpecifically, the first dimension of the effect holds that those who define\nthemselves in the one-down role and resort to aggressive strategies as a way\nof seeking change in the power structure are less likely to obtain the outcome\nthey desire. In contrast, terrorists who spend more time negotiating and show-\ning a willingness to make concessions are more likely to secure their desired\noutcomes. Interestingly, in the context of terrorist attacks, the behaviors that\nincrease affiliation between the parties and led to better outcomes included\nTable 4.

Although this contradicts our expectations from\nother forms of negotiation where making excessive demands is considered an\naggressive strategy, authorities in intense conflict situations may conceivably\nview any form of dialogue as cooperative and a helpful inroad to resolving the\nincident.\nRegarding the prominence of role identity, when compared to nationalist-\nseparatists and social-revolutionaries, the terrorists with a religious ideology\ntypically used more aggressive strategies. This use was pervasive across the\ndifferent kinds of aggressive strategies, which is consistent with the idea that\nthese terrorists aim to maximize fear and threat rather than use these dynamics\nto achieve some other goal. Consistent with this notion, religious terrorists en-\ngaged in very little affiliative behavior compared to nationalist-separatists and\nsocial-revolutionaries. This unwillingness to engage in normative interaction\nillustrates the religious terrorist\u2019s lack of interdependence with the system they\nare attacking and their determination to achieve a set of goals without giving\nconsideration to alternatives (Silke 2003). These findings suggest that identity\nplays a significant role in the evolution of terrorist negotiations and, conse-\nquently, that it is important to understand the cultural and social background\nof those terrorists authorities engage in negotiation.\nHowever, it is important to note that there were some important variations\nacross the hijacker and barricade-siege roles. Compared to barricade-siege\nincidents, hijackers typically i) used more overt aggression as a means of shift-\ning power; ii) tended not to engage in negotiation; iii) tended not to use threats\nto the hostages as a way of gaining leverage in the incident or negotiation, and\niv) were less likely to make concessions, presumably because they were less\nprepared to engage in any form of bargaining to obtain a certain outcome. The\nfocus of aerial hijacks was on overt aggression to maximize the threat of the\nsituation and force the authorities into capitulating. In contrast, the barricade-\nsiege incidents were focused on more indirect attempts to change the power\nstructure combined with normative bargaining for a resolution.\nPerhaps the most significant implication of these findings is that in extreme\ncircumstances the role effect takes some interesting twists. In less extreme con-\nditions, such as buyer-seller negotiations, the one down effect generally reveals\nmore conciliatory behavior from the higher-power party. The higher-power\nparty experiments with reaching out to propose more negotiated options while\nfocusing on the substantive nature of the conflict. However, in the current\nfindings, when the lower-power party (i.e. the terrorist) engaged in extreme\naggression, the higher-powered authorities quickly reciprocated with tactical\nattempts to resolve the dispute.\nOne explanation for this role-effect twist comes from research in game the-\nory. Some studies in this area have explored the relative impact of small and\nIN_8,3_f6_527-547  6\/24\/04  14:22  Page 543\n544 WILLIAM A. DONOHUE AND PAUL J. TAYLOR\nlarge discrepancies in initial power between subjects. Research supports an\n\u201cinverted U-shaped\u201d relationship between relative threat capacity (how much\neach side can harm the other\u2019s position) within a bargaining game and indexes\nof contending (e.g. counterthreats, penalty use, unwillingness to yield to a\nthreat). Hornstein (1965) and Vitz and Kite (1970) found that contending was\nmore prominent when there was mild discrepancy in threat capacity than\nwhen there was equal or highly unequal threat capacity. Hornstein, in partic-\nular, provided evidence that the low-power negotiator was unwilling to accept\nlower status in the mild discrepancy condition, and fought for equal treatment\n(i.e., followed threats with aggressive behavior) to a much greater extent than\nwhen confronted with a highly unequal discrepancy.\nThis discrepancy-size explanation would predict that terrorists who per-\nceive mild discrepancies in power levels would be more willing to use highly\ncontentious and deadly strategies to equal power whereas those who perceive\nhighly unequal threat capacity would be more willing to negotiate. Does this\nfinding suggest that an important strategy for fighting terrorism is continuous\nmuscle-flexing by the higher-power party to discourage terrorist aggression?\nThere is considerable debate about the appropriateness of using force in gen-\neral to combat terrorism, with critics highlighting that such action can confirm\nthe terrorists\u2019 self image as heroic martyrs, increase the demand for revenge,\nand potentially add to those who identify with the cause (Enders, Sandler, and\nCauley 1990; Seger 2003). However, within the context of negotiating with\nterrorists, it may prove a useful strategic complement to traditional attrition-\nfocused techniques.\nFuture research examining the role effect in a terrorist context ought to ex-\ntend into more in-depth analyses of actual terrorist incidents. For example, in\nthe current analysis we implicitly viewed the behaviors of terrorists as lead-\ning to certain \u201cresponses\u201d by the authorities. However, the actions of author-\nities and terrorists are necessarily intertwined, such that an authority\u2019s actions\nare likely to have an equally significant effect on the strategies terrorists\u2019 per-\nceive as useful to pursue and the way they expect the authorities to react. The\nresult is that certain actions by the authorities will work to lower the aggres-\nsion used by terrorists, while others may shift the focus of aggression away\nfrom afflicting damage and towards attempts to control the bargaining process.\nExtending this line of argument to the longer-term, we might also consider the\npossibility that terrorists\u2019 initial behaviors are shaped by expectations derived\nfrom authority\u2019s responses to previous incidents.\nUnderstanding how negotiators influence one another during the bargaining\nprocess could be addressed by obtaining actual interactions between terrorists\nand authorities to gain a more refined understanding of how these negotiations\nevolve. The data set examined here offers only secondhand accounts of activ-\nIN_8,3_f6_527-547  6\/24\/04  14:22  Page 544\nTESTING THE ROLE EFFECT IN TERRORIST NEGOTIATIONS 545\nities in these incidents, and the utility of the analysis hinges on whether the\nbehavioral scales adequately capture the complex dynamics of the interaction\n(Mickolus 1987). Actual interactions would provide a far more detailed pic-\nture of how terrorists and authorities define and implement their roles. Far\nfrom being a mere academic exercise, the development of such a body of\nknowledge can be of direct use to negotiators and policymakers attempting to\nsave lives in terrorist crisis negotiations.\nReferences\nAlexandroff, A.
