From\nearlier work in the laboratory, photon scattering from the 92, 75 keV isomeric state has been shown to result\nin eventual de-excitation to the relatively short-lived 11 ground state, through intermediate states whose\ncharacter is uncertain. It is suggested here that the lowest observed photon resonances match the energies of\nknown states in the rotational band based on the recently assigned Kp551 state at 592 keV, states which are\naccessible by E1 excitation from the 92 isomer. Analysis of the previously observed resonance strengths and\nthe known in-band properties implies g-ray E1 transition probabilities which are stronger than expected given\nthe nominal K forbiddenness. Predicted widths for \u2018\u2018back\u2019\u2019-decay to the 92 isomer and its rotational band are\ncalculated and shown to be significant.

The addi-\ntional implication, that the inelastic excitation required K\nmixing to allow for the change of eight units in the quantum\nnumber K ~the projection of the spin on the nuclear deforma-\ntion axis! to pass from the Kp592 isomer to the Kp511\nground state, provided one of the imperatives for detailed\nstudies of its nuclear structure. Since the nucleus 180Ta is\nprolate deformed but axially symmetric, the angular-\nmomentum projection, K, on the symmetry axis should be\napproximately conserved @6#.\nRecent work on the spectroscopy of 180Ta @7\u20139# and more\nprecise studies of photon excitation @10# have given informa-\ntion which may provide the ingredients for a more detailed\nunderstanding of the excitation and decay process. The gen-\neral difficulty faced, is that while the spectroscopic studies\nare effective in identifying yrast states which are predomi-\nnantly of high-K , the states involved in the (g ,g8) excita-\ntions which eventually lead to the Kp511 ground state, are\nlikely to be nonyrast and of relatively low-K .\nWith the benefit of recent reassignment of parities for\nsome known nonyrast states @9# it is now possible to identify\na path via a band of medium-K states accessible initially by\nE1 excitation from the 92 isomer. The previously measured\nphoton-scattering cross sections can then be analyzed to ex-\ntract decay widths and the implied E1 strengths.

The decay width of 2.98\n31025 eV therefore corresponds to a transition strength of\n1.3931025 single-particle units ~W.u.!, or equivalently, a\nhindrance FW573104. While this hindrance is substantial,\nit is less than would be expected given the K mismatch, at\nleast superficially. Allowed E1 transitions between rotational\nbands have hindrances which may vary substantially because\nof structure effects ~such as specific configuration changes!\nbut normally they would fall in the range of 104 to 105.\nAdditional hindrance is expected for transitions which are K\nforbidden @6,14#. In the present case, with a K change of four\nunits, and a multipolarity of unity, the transition is threefold\nK forbidden, which would normally carry an additional hin-\ndrance of about 102 per degree of forbiddenness @14#. While\nthere is considerable variation and uncertainty in such esti-\nmates, the present hindrance value (73104) must be seen as\nmarginal if it is to be understood in this context.\nOne effect which will modify hindrances is the specific K\nmixing associated with the configurations of the states in-\nvolved. The 92 configuration, for example, consists of the\nneutron (n) and proton (p) Nilsson-model orbitals\nn9\/21@624# ^ p9\/22@514# . The n9\/21@624# orbital is from\nan i13\/2 neutron, which will have significant K mixing due to\nCoriolis coupling. Estimates of this mixing using the\nparticle-rotor model give amplitudes of about 0.30 for a K\n58 admixture in the 92 state, with slightly higher values in\nthe higher-spin members of the same band. Similarly, the 51\nband, with probable configuration n1\/22@510#\n^ p9\/22@514# , itself shows the effects of rotation alignment\n@7# which is a manifestation of Coriolis mixing, hence it\nmust also contain significant K admixtures. The systematic\neffect of such mixtures on E1 rates for a given configuration\nchange has been documented for specific cases ~e.g., Ref.\n@15#!.\nWe can also look to cases involving the same configura-\ntion change as occurs between the 51 band and the 92 band\nas a further guide; the only comparable E1 transitions in the\nregion are in 181Hf, where a 9\/21@624# , 80 ms isomer de-\ncays to members of the 1\/22@510# band @16#. Note that this\ninvolves the same level of K forbiddenness. In 181Hf, the\nhindrance factors are in the range FW5101021011, approxi-\nmately the strengths that would be expected normally.

Level-\ndensity effects ~random mixing due to overlapping levels!\nmay be the key feature, as these are already known to reduce\nhindrances for E2 transitions from states, depending on their\nposition above the yrast line @17#.\nIndependent of the explanation, to be consistent with the\ninferred E1 excitation strength, this treatment also implies a\nsignificant g-ray branch from the 1076 keV 81 state back to\nthe 92 isomer. As is clear from Figs. 1 and 2, the next two\nresonances also match ~within the uncertainties! the energies\nof Kp551 band members. The situation is summarized in\nTable I ~and schematically in Fig. 2! where the decay widths\nare listed for all states of the Kp551 band which might be\naccessible by E1 excitation from the 92, 75 keV isomer.\nThe decay widths within the rotational band are estimated\nusing a combination of the rotational-model formulas for a\nband with K55, and the known in-band g-ray branching\nratios from which the other band properties associated with\nthe intrinsic configuration (gK2gR values, mixing ratios,\netc.! have previously been extracted @7,9#.

The E1 width for the 1076\nkeV state is extracted from the photon-scattering cross-\nsection data, as discussed above, and all other E1 widths in\nTable I have been estimated assuming the same hindrance of\nFW573104. As can be seen from the table, there are several\nE1 decay paths possible from each of the 91 and 101 mem-\nbers of the Kp551 band, which would also result in signifi-\ncant g-ray branches back to the 92 band. These are illus-\ntrated schematically in Fig. 2.\nFurthermore, the results of Table I can be used in Eqs. ~1!\nand ~2! to predict the cross sections which should be ob-\nserved at resonance energies corresponding to the 91 and\n101 states. Application of these formulas gives cross-section\npredictions of 0.073 eV.b and 0.089 eV.b at photon energies\nof 1203 keV and 1424 keV, respectively.

Such branches become more probable as the ex-\ncitation energy increases.\nAs stated earlier, even with the E1 strengths restricted to\nthat obtained for the first resonance, all predicted E1 g-ray\nbranches back to the 92 band are significant. Out-of-band\nE1 transitions are not unusual, but their importance in the\npresent context is that their observation could establish con-\nclusively the relationship between the photon-scattering\nresonances and the states observed in high-resolution g-ray\nspectroscopy. Their presence is both a stringent test of the\ninternal consistency of the proposition, and a test of the tran-\nsition strengths implied. Such branches were not assigned in\nthe work to date @7\u20139# and while this might imply that the\nE1 strengths should be lower ~which would then be in con-\nflict with the cross sections!, at this stage the nonobservation\ncan be attributed to experimental limitations. The members\nof the Kp551 band are well above the yrast line, and their\nvery weak population in in-beam experiments makes very\ndifficult the g-g gating on transitions feeding into each state.\nSuch gating is necessary to identify properly the relatively\nhigh-energy E1 branches.

This is consistent with the\nneed to minimize the change in K. For example, the lowest-\nenergy 81 state that decays to the short-lived K51 ground\nstate is at 736 keV @7# equivalent to an isomer photoactiva-\ntion energy of only 661 keV. From the total angular-\nmomentum and parity values, which permit an E1 transition\nfrom 180Tam, it might be expected that the stellar photon bath\nwould destroy 180Tam through this state. However, the E1\ntransition would be sevenfold K forbidden, and the transition\nhindrance factor would be expected to be much greater than\nthat observed for transitions to the K55 band. Thus, the\nability of 180Tam to survive in stars may be attributed, at least\nin part, to axially symmetric nuclear deformation and the\nconsequent influence of the K quantum number.\nFinally, still higher-energy resonances have recently been\nobserved by Belic et al. @11# and these can be arranged in\nsets of three, indicated by the groups of asterisks labeled ~B!\nand ~C! in Fig. 1. The nonyrast experimental states in the\nhigher-energy region are probably inaccessible to conven-\ntional spectroscopy, but it should be noted that the roughly\nmonotonic energy spacing is consistent with band structure.\nFurther, group ~B! falls in the region expected for the band\nmembers of the second Kp551 band or the first Kp561\nband ~from the unfavored couplings of the n1\/22@521#\n^ p9\/22@514# and n3\/22@512# ^ p9\/22@514# configura-\ntions! predicted by calculations @7# and indicated in Fig. 1.\nIn summary, the comparison of recent photon-scattering\nand g-ray spectroscopy data enables discrete levels from a\nband with Kp551 to be identified as intermediate states in\nan excitation\/decay process. The lowest of these is at 1076\nkeV. If its identification with the 1085~10! keV resonance is\ncorrect, then a 1001 keV, E1 back-decay transition is pre-\ndicted. Similar transitions are predicted from the 91 and 101\nstates of the same rotational band whose energies also match\nphoton resonances, if the equivalent E1 hindrances are pre-\nserved. Observation of such transitions would serve both as\nconfirmation of the proposed associations and as a quantita-\ntive test of the implied E1 strengths and K hindrances. Im-\nportantly, the E1 transitions implied by these analyses are\nsignificantly less hindered than expected given the K forbid-\ndenness. The ability to match nonyrast rotational states iden-\ntified in spectroscopy with individual photon-scattering reso-\nnances may provide a means of probing, quantitatively,\nK-mixing well above the yrast line.\nWe are very grateful to the authors of Ref. @11# for\ngraciously providing their results prior to publication.
