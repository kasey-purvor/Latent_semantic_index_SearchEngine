Introduction\n[2] Recent observations have shown that Jupiter\u2019s polar\nregions possess a complex auroral morphology, observable\nover a wide range of wavelengths from infrared to X-ray,\nwhich is potentially revealing of the structure and dynamics\nof the large-scale jovian plasma environment [e.g., Satoh et\nal., 1996; Prange\u00b4 et al., 1998; Clarke et al., 1998; Vasavada\net al., 1999; Grodent et al., 2002; Gladstone et al., 2002].\nWith increasing latitude, these auroras comprise compo-\nnents associated with the footprints of the Galilean moons, a\nbright \u2018main oval\u2019 which encircles the magnetic poles in\neach hemisphere, and structured polar emissions lying\nwithin this oval, principally in the noon and dusk sectors,\ntermed the \u2018bright polar region\u2019. By comparison, the region\nwithin the main oval on the dawn side is dark in the UV,\nthough not devoid of emission in the infra red, and is termed\nthe \u2018dark polar region\u2019. It has also recently been shown that\nspatially resolved Doppler shifts of spectral lines of the H3\n+\nion can be obtained from ground-based measurements in the\ninfrared, thus opening up the possibility of remote sensing\nstudies of jovian polar ionospheric flows. The first such\nobservations, reported by Rego et al. [1999], revealed the\npresence of significant sub-corotation of the plasma flow in\nthe main oval ionosphere. Most recently Stallard et al.\n[2001] have confirmed these results, and have also pre-\nsented the first Doppler observations within both the bright\nand dark polar regions. They found that, relative to rigid\ncorotation with the planet, the emission from the bright\npolar region in the dusk sector is weakly blue-shifted (i.e. is\nweakly sub-corotational), while that from the dark polar\nregion in the dawn sector is strongly red-shifted (i.e. departs\nstrongly in the sense of sub-corotation).\n[3] These observations prompt consideration of the iono-\nspheric flows expected on the basis of theory. The model we\ndiscuss is that outlined by Cowley et al. [1996] on the basis\nof theoretical considerations and spacecraft fly-by flow data,\nwhose ionospheric ramifications have not previously been\nconsidered explicitly. Here we examine consequences for\nionospheric flows and currents, and discuss relationships\nwith auroral observations.\n2. Equatorial Flow\n[4] In the steady-state situation considered here, the\njovian flow is taken to consist of three components. This\nis illustrated by the equatorial streamlines shown in Figure\n1, where the direction towards the Sun is at the bottom of\nthe figure, dawn is to the left, and dusk to the right. In the\ninner region the plasma streamlines are closed around the\nplanet, though extending to greater distances on the night-\nside than on the dayside due to the asymmetry imposed by\nthe confining effect of the solar wind [Bunce and Cowley,\n2001a]. We have not shown explicitly the observed simul-\ntaneous shift of the streamlines towards dawn in this\nregion, associated with a dawn-to-dusk electric field which\nmay be produced by the day-night asymmetry [Goertz and\nIp, 1984]. The physics of the region is dominated by the\ncentrifugally-driven outflow of plasma from the Io torus,\nassociated with small-scale \u2018diffusive\u2019 motions which are\nalso not represented in the figure [e.g. Siscoe and Summers,\n1981]. As the iogenic plasma diffuses outwards, its angular\nvelocity falls from rigid corotation with the planet due to\nconservation of angular momentum, an effect which is offset\nby the frictional torque imposed by ion-neutral collisions in\nthe Pedersen layer of the ionosphere. Steady-state angular\nvelocity profiles were first calculated by Hill [1979] for the\ncase of a dipole planetary field, and by Pontius [1997] for\nmore realistic field geometries representative of the jovian\nmiddle magnetosphere. They found that significant depar-\ntures from rigid corotation are expected at radial distances\nbeyond a few tens of Jupiter radii (1 RJ \u0002 71,400 km) for\ntypical values of the ionospheric Pedersen conductivity\n(few \u0003 0.1 mho) and iogenic plasma mass outflow rate\n(\u0004103 kg s\u00011).

These field-perpendicular currents are then joined\nby field-aligned currents which flow outward from the\nionosphere into the current sheet throughout this region,\nwhich have been suggested to be associated with the main\noval auroras [Bunce and Cowley, 2001b; Cowley and\nBunce, 2001; Hill, 2001; Southwood and Kivelson, 2001].\nThe related sub-corotational flow is that derived from\nionospheric observations by Rego et al. [1999] and Stallard\net al. [2001] as mentioned above, and also from magneto-\nspheric particle data by e.g. Sands and McNutt [1988], Kane\net al. [1995], and Krupp et al. [2001].\n[5] This sub-corotating \u2018Hill region\u2019, as it is labelled in\nFigure 1, is taken to comprise the main part of the jovian\nmiddle magnetosphere, extending in the equatorial plane to\ndistances of several tens of RJ, depending on the state of\nextension of the magnetosphere. It is then surrounded by a\nregion, still driven by planetary rotation, in which current\nsheet dynamics and reconnection play an important role in\nthe loss of cool iogenic plasma down-tail. As first dis-\ncussed by Vasyliunas [1983], we envisage outer current\nsheet field lines that are confined by the solar wind on the\ndayside, stretching out down-tail as they rotate into the dusk\nsector, and then pinching off via reconnection and the\nformation of tailward-flowing plasmoids. In Figure 1 this is\ndepicted as a steady-state process associated with a\nreconnection line marked by the dashes and X\u2019s, labelled\n\u2018Vasyliunas-cycle tail X-line\u2019. Recent observations, how-\never, indicate considerable time-dependency [Woch et al.,\n2002]. In the figure the O-type line of the plasmoid, which\nis a plasma streamline, is marked by an \u2018O\u2019, while the outer\nedge of the plasmoid is shown by the dot-dashed line\nmarked \u2018P\u2019, which eventually asymptotes to the dusk\nmagnetopause. We thus anticipate on this basis that the\ninner \u2018Hill-region\u2019 will be surrounded by a layer of faster\n(but generally still sub-corotational) flow in the dawn sector\nas the mass-reduced flux tubes flow sunward downstream of\nthe \u2018Vasyliunas\u2019 reconnection site. The coupling currents\nwill thereby be reduced, associated with a \u2018return\u2019 field-\naligned current flow from the current sheet to the\nionosphere in this region, as inferred from spacecraft data\nin this sector by both Bunce and Cowley [2001b] and\nKhurana [2001]. This effect will be reduced by further\nmass-loading as the flux tubes subsequently rotate into the\nnoon and dusk sector.\n[6] The third region shown in Figure 1 contains the\nflow associated with the solar wind interaction and the\nDungey-cycle [Dungey, 1961]. This process is initiated by\nmagnetopause reconnection with the interplanetary mag-\nnetic field, which we suppose takes place over wide\nregions of the dayside boundary, as indicated by the\ndashed line and X\u2019s labelled \u2018Dungey-cycle magnetopause\nX-line\u2019. The equatorial streamlines of this system end at\nthis boundary as dayside reconnection takes place with\nnorthward-directed interplanetary field lines, such that the\nresulting \u2018open\u2019 field lines are carried over the poles of the\nplanet and out of the plane of the diagram. Since the \u2018plasma\nsheet\u2019 in the center plane of the tail is occupied by out-\nflowing iogenic plasma in the dusk and midnight sectors via\nthe Vasyliunas-cycle, we propose that the reconnection site\nassociated with the solar wind-driven process will be\nconfined to the dawn sector, as indicated by the dashed line\nand X\u2019s labelled \u2018Dungey-cycle tail X-line\u2019. The open lines\nwill thus flow across the tail lobe predominantly from dusk\nto dawn. The flux tubes closed at the Dungey-cycle tail\nreconnection site will then flow back towards the dayside\nmagnetopause to complete the cycle, forming a dayside\nboundary layer adjacent to the magnetopause that we\nidentify with the \u2018outer magnetosphere\u2019 region observed in\nspacecraft data. The characteristic feature of such a layer will\nbe the presence of low plasma densities compared with the\ninterior region (the flux tubes having previously been \u2018open\u2019\nin the tail lobe for significant intervals), in agreement with\nthe observations e.g. of Phillips et al. [1993]. The flux tubes\nwhich are pinched off tailward of the tail reconnection site\nflow rapidly away from the planet, possibly related to the\nanti-sunward \u2018magnetospheric wind\u2019 observed adjacent to\nthe dawn tail magnetopause by Krimigis et al. [1981] (to\nwhich the Vasyliunas-cycle may also contribute).\n[7] With regard to the overall flux transport in these flow\nsystems, Cowley and Bunce [2001] estimate a voltage of\n\u000450 MV across the middle magnetosphere plasma sheet\nfrom the inner edge of the Io torus at \u00045 RJ to an outer edge\nat \u0004100 RJ, derived from observation-based empirical\nmodels of the equatorial field and flow. However, the\nvoltage across the main region of outward field-aligned\ncurrent mapping to the \u2018main oval\u2019, located in the equatorial\nplane between \u000425 and the outer edge at \u0004100 RJ in their\nmodel, was found to be \u00042.5 MV. It seems likely that the\nflux transport in the Vasyliunas-cycle will be of a\ncomparable order or smaller. By comparison, estimates of\nthe flux transport in the Dungey-cycle are \u00040.5\u20131 MV [e.g.\nHill et al., 1983]. These values are obtained from estimating\nthe voltage in the solar wind across a magnetospheric\ndiameter, and then multiplying by an empirical Earth-based\n\u2018efficiency-factor\u2019 of 10\u201320% [e.g. Reiff et al., 1981]. The\nvoltage across the outer magnetosphere layer adjacent to the\ndayside magnetopause is also of this order, taking the layer\nto be 10\u201315 RJ wide, with a field strength of B \u0002 5\u201310 nT,\nand flowing at a speed of 100\u2013150 km s\u20131. The above\nsuggestion of a connection between the \u2018outer magneto-\nsphere\u2019 and the dayside return flows of the Dungey-cycle is\nthus plausible in voltage terms.\nFigure 1. Sketch of the flows in the jovian equatorial\nplane.\n24 - 2 COWLEY ET AL.: JUPITER\u2019S POLAR IONOSPHERIC FLOWS: THEORETICAL INTERPRETATION\n3. Ionospheric Flow\n[8] The ionospheric plasma flows and structures which\ncorrespond to the above equatorial discussion are sketched\nin Figure 2, where, as in Figure 1, the direction towards the\nSun is at the bottom of the figure, dawn is to the left, and\ndusk to the right. We have also transformed to a frame\nwhere the planetary dipole axis is at rest, such that the flow\npattern (to a first approximation) does not vary with time,\nassuming steady magnetospheric conditions. At the outer\nlimit of the figure, corresponding to \u000420\u0001 co-latitude (and\nmapping to \u000410 RJ in the equatorial plane), the plasma\napproximately corotates with the planet. With decreasing\nco-latitude the plasma angular velocity then drops within\nthe \u2018Hill-region\u2019, reaching perhaps half of rigid corotation at\nthe poleward boundary of this region at \u000415\u0001 co-latitude\n[e.g. Sands and McNutt, 1988; Kane et al., 1995; Stallard et\nal., 2001], this corresponding to a flow speed in this frame\nof \u00041.6 km s\u00011. In considering the electric currents which\nflow in the ionosphere, it must then be remembered that the\nneutral atmosphere is rotating about the magnetic pole in\nthis frame at essentially the planetary angular velocity\n(unless significantly slowed by ion neutral frictional drag),\nand hence at a speed which is higher than the sub-corotating\nplasma flow. The Hall current is therefore directed anti-\nclockwise, in the same general direction of the plasma flow,\ncarried by ions convected with the neutral gas, while the\nPedersen current is directed equatorward, opposite to the\ndirection of the electric field in this frame. Both currents\nincrease as the plasma angular velocity falls. The equator-\nward-directed Pedersen current thus increases as the plasma\nangular velocity falls with decreasing co-latitude in the \u2018Hill\nregion\u2019, thus requiring upward-directed field-aligned cur-\nrents in this region as indicated above, and as depicted in\nFigure 2 by the circled dots. This is the current which is\nsuggested to be directly related to the main oval auroras.\nInside this region, the angular velocities may increase\nsomewhat in the region occupied by the Vasyliunas-cycle\nflows, more particularly on the dawn side than on the dusk\nside, as mentioned above. The Pedersen current will then be\nreduced and the direction of the field-aligned current\nreversed to downwards, as indicated in Figure 2 by the\ncircled crosses in the dawn sector. This pattern of current\nmay then relate to the observed dawn-dusk asymmetry in\nthe form of the main oval auroras, in which a relatively\nnarrow arc is typical of the dawn sector, while broader more\ndiffuse structures are typical of dusk.\n[9] The final region is that occupied by Dungey-cycle\nflows, consisting of a region of open magnetic flux and anti-\nsunward flow, shown hatched, and a region of closed flux\nand return sunward flow. From the observed diameter and\nfield strength of the lobes of the jovian tail [e.g. Acun\u02dca et\nal., 1983], we estimate the open magnetic flux in each lobe\nto be \u00043.5 \u0003 1011 Wb, thus comprising a little less than half\nof the jovian polar magnetic flux which lies poleward of the\nboundary of the \u2018Hill region\u2019 at \u000415\u0001 co-latitude. This\nsuggests that the magnetic flux mapping into the Vasyliu-\nnas-cycle in the polar region is of comparable order. If the\nregion of open flux was circular and centered on the\nmagnetic pole, it would then occupy a region down to \u00049\u0001\nco-latitude. However, while the ionospheric image of the\ndayside reconnection line may lie roughly symmetrically\nwith respect to noon, as shown in Figure 2, we suggest that\non the night side the open flux is displaced to the dawn side\nof the polar region by the magnetospheric asymmetry\nimposed by the Vasyliunas-cycle, specifically by the\noutflow of iogenic plasma down the dusk and midnight\ntail. The dusk sector of the polar region then corresponds to\nclosed field lines which map to the tail duskward of the\nouter boundary of the plasmoid (marked \u2018P\u2019 in Figure 1).\nThis asymmetric polar field structure was previously\ninferred by Pallier and Prange\u00b4 [2001] from UV auroral\nimages. An additional consequence of this asymmetry is\nthat the return flows of the Dungey cycle take place only on\nthe dawn side of the region of open flux, as shown in Figure\n1, such that this cycle produces only a single flow cell at\nJupiter rather than the two at Earth.\n[10] The region of open flux may be expected to be\naurorally \u2018dark\u2019, since it is magnetically connected to a tail\nlobe with very low plasma density and essentially no hot\nplasma [e.g. Moses et al., 1987], having little flow\ndynamics, and with field-aligned currents which generally\nwill be directed downwards in the central polar region. The\ndawn region of the Vasyliunas-cycle flows may also be\ndark, where the field-aligned currents have been suggested\nto be downward-directed, though these flux tubes will\ncontain some hot accelerated plasma in the region down-\nstream of the Vasyliunas-cycle tail reconnection line.\nHowever, the flows in these two potentially \u2018dark\u2019 regions\nwill be very different, with the dawn Vasyliunas-cycle flux\ntubes flowing sunwards at speeds of \u00041\u20132 km s\u00011, likewise\nprobably the adjacent dawn \u2018return\u2019 flows of the Dungey-\ncycle, while the anti-sunward flow within the region of open\nfluxwill be very slow indeed, assuming insignificant twisting\nof the lobe field by the ionosphere. This is inferred from the\nestimated travel time of open field lines through the tail lobe.\nFor example, if we take a Dungey-cycle transpolar voltage of\n\u00040.5\u20131 MV as indicated above, the travel time through a\nlobe of \u00042 nT field strength and \u0004150 RJ radius is \u00045\u201310\ndays. This implies a jovian tail length of a few AU, with\ndistended disconnected tail field structures stretching even\nfurther downstream from the planet. Such a travel time across\nthe region of open flux in the ionosphere, however, implies\nanti-sunward flow speeds of only \u000450\u2013100 m s\u00011. The\nregion of open flux will therefore be characteristically almost\n\u2018stagnant\u2019 compared with the regions of surrounding flow.\nFigure 2. Sketch of the flows in the northern jovian\nionosphere.\nCOWLEY ET AL.: JUPITER\u2019S POLAR IONOSPHERIC FLOWS: THEORETICAL INTERPRETATION 24 - 3\nThese auroral and flow properties suggest a connection to the\ncentral \u2018dark polar region\u2019 of Stallard et al. [2001], with its\nsignificant \u2018red-shift\u2019 compared with rigid corotation with the\nplanet mentioned above. In fact, further investigation of these\ndata in a companion paper [Stallard et al., 2002], shows that\nthis \u2018red shift\u2019 results typically in near-zero central \u2018dark\npolar region\u2019 plasma flows in the dipole rest frame (in the\nregion they term \u2018f-DPR\u2019), in agreement with this hypothesis.\nStallard et al. [2002] also show that the central dark region is\nalso surrounded by a region in the dawn and noon sectors\nwhich is also dark but has faster sub-corotating flows (termed\n\u2018r-DPR\u2019). We here associate this latter region with the\nsunward-flowing layer of \u2018return\u2019 Dungey- and Vasyliunas-\ncycle flows in the dawn sector shown in Figure 2.\n[11] A final point to be made concerns possible auroral\nand flow dynamics related to the reconnection sites asso-\nciated with the Dungey- and Vasyliunas-cycles. Analogy\nwith Earth leads one to expect transient phenomena akin to\ndayside \u2018flux transfer events\u2019 and nightside substorms. If so,\nwe suggest that the transient phenomena observed near\nnoon [e.g. Pallier and Prange\u00b4, 2001; Gladstone et al.,\n2002] may relate to dayside magnetopause reconnection and\ncusp dynamics, while the \u2018dawn storms\u2019 and \u2018storm-like\nevents\u2019 observed just poleward of the main oval in the dawn\nsector [e.g. Ge\u00b4rard et al., 1994; Clarke et al., 1998; Grodent\net al., 2002] may relate to activations at the Dungey- or\nVasyliunas-cycle tail reconnection sites (or both). At the\nsame time we recognise that if the Vasyliunas-cycle takes\nplace through smaller-scale transient reconnection events in\nthe outer region of the middle magnetosphere, as opposed to\nthe large-scale steady-state flows discussed for simplicity\nhere, this will lead to smaller-scale transient flows and\nauroras appearing in the region of Vasyliunas-cycle flow,\nwhich we may suppose will be located preferentially in the\npost-noon sector, that is, in the \u2018bright polar region\u2019.\nReferences\nAcun\u02dca, M.
