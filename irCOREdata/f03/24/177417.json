The ecological consequences of this\ntrade-off for tropical trees remain poorly resolved, despite their potential importance for tropical forest conservation. We\ninvestigated the flower size number trade-off and its implications for fecundity in a sample of tree species from the\nDipterocarpaceae on Borneo.\nMethodology\/Principal Findings: We combined experimental exclusion of pollinators in 11 species, with direct and indirect\nestimates of contemporary pollen dispersal in two study species and published estimates of pollen dispersal in a further\nthree species to explore the relationship between flower size, pollinator size and mean pollen dispersal distance. Maximum\nflower production was two orders of magnitude greater in small-flowered than large-flowered species of Dipterocarpaceae.\nIn contrast, fruit production was unrelated to flower size and did not differ significantly among species. Small-flowered\nspecies had both smaller-sized pollinators and lower mean pollination success than large-flowered species. Average pollen\ndispersal distances were lower and frequency of mating between related individuals was higher in a smaller-flowered\nspecies than a larger-flowered confamilial. Our synthesis of pollen dispersal estimates across five species of dipterocarp\nsuggests that pollen dispersal scales positively with flower size.\nConclusions and Their Significance: Trade-offs embedded in the relationship between flower size and pollination success\ncontribute to a reduction in the variance of fecundity among species. It is therefore plausible that these processes could\ndelay competitive exclusion and contribute to maintenance of species coexistence in this ecologically and economically\nimportant family of tropical trees. These results have practical implications for tree species conservation and restoration.\nSeed collection from small-flowered species may be especially vulnerable to cryptic genetic erosion. Our findings also\nhighlight the potential for differential vulnerability of tropical tree species to the deleterious consequences of forest\nfragmentation.\nCitation: Kettle CJ, Maycock CR, Ghazoul J, Hollingsworth PM, Khoo E, et al.

The\nattractiveness of these different floral displays is closely coupled to\nmating system, the type and breadth of pollinators and individual\nfecundity [1,2]. Studies across plant species show that species tend to\nproduce fewer flowers per individual as the size of the flower increases\n[3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. The causal agents of this trade-off have been\ninvestigated empirically in a number of plant species, indicating that\nhierarchical resource allocation [10,11], pollen discounting via\ngeitonogamy in obligate out-crossing species [1,4,11] and pollen\nlimitation [12] are all important drivers in this trade-off.\nFew studies have, however, determined whether a flower size\/\nnumber trade-off occurs across, as well as within, species (but see 7)\nand examined its consequences for plant community structure.\nThe potential implications could include partitioning of pollinators\namong species as a function of flower size, differential pollen\ndispersal as a function of pollinator size and mobility relationships\n[13], and differences in fecundity among species. Surprisingly,\ninteractions between plants and their pollinators have received\nlimited attention as a driver of species diversity in tropical tree\ncommunities [14,15,16]. Partitioning of pollinator services could\nlimit competitive exclusion, and if these interactions can be shown\nto contribute to an equalisation of fitness, contribute to species\ncoexistence [17].\nWe combine experimental ecology, field observation and\nmolecular ecological approaches to investigate the ecological\nimplications of a flower size\/number trade-off in a clade of\ntropical forest canopy and emergent trees. The processes that\ndetermine the differential fecundity of individuals are poorly\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 2 | e16111\nunderstood, and therefore the importance to demography of pre-\ndispersal stages of plant reproduction may have been underesti-\nmated. Studies that link floral traits to fecundity are also likely to\nreveal important implications of flower size vs number trade-offs\nfor species\u2019 differential responses to habitat degradation [12,18].\nFor example, increased isolation of individual trees is of concern\nfor the management of tropical tree species that have been heavily\nfragmented in recent years [19].\nWe used a group of 12 coexisting dipterocarp species ranging in\nflower size (calyx diameter from 1.2 mm to 10.2 mm) to explore\nthe function of flower size and number and pollination systems in\nfruit production. Specifically, we combine measures of flower size,\nflower number and pollination success (as inferred from pollen\ntube growth data) with measures of paternity and genetic\nrelatedness within mapped populations of two species to test the\nfollowing explicit hypotheses.\n1. Across species, flower size scales negatively with mean flower\nproduction per individual, which would be indicative of a\nflower size\/number trade-off.\n2. Across species, mean pollination success (as defined by the\nproportion of flower styles containing pollen tubes) increases\nwith flower size.\n3. Species with small flowers have small-bodied pollinators.\n4. Species with smaller bodied pollinators have more limited\npollen dispersal distances.\n5. The proportion of flowers that give rise to fruit scales positively\nwith flower size.\n6. Spatial aggregation and limited pollen dispersal increase\ninbreeding in a small flowered species.\nThese hypotheses encapsulate a set of trade-offs between flower\nsize, pollinator body size and pollen dispersal that might have\nconsequences for fruit production and fecundity, which are\nimportant components of plant fitness (see Figure 1).\nTree species in the Dipterocarpaceae dominate lowland rain\nforests of Southeast Asia, accounting for up to 80 percent of the\ndensity and basal area of canopy trees [20]. Dipterocarps display\nvariable flower size and morphology and are pollinated by insects\nincluding thrips, beetles, moths and giant honeybees\n[21,22,23,24,25,26,27]. Reproductively mature trees of many\ndipterocarps exhibit irregular mass flowering [20]. Dipterocarps\nproduce hermaphroditic flowers and are considered predominate-\nly out-crossing, which is maintained through pre- and post- zygotic\nincompatibility mechanisms [28]. Apomixis has been reported in\nsome species [24,29], but we found no evidence of this in the\nprogeny arrays of our study species. Fruit dispersal occurs by\ngravity and wind assisted gyration for the majority of fruit falling\nbeneath the mother tree or a within 20\u201330 m [30,31]. Limited\nseed dispersal leads to the aggregation of related individuals, and\nsignificant fine-scale spatial genetic structure has been observed in\nthe majority of dipterocarp species studied [32].\nResults\nFlower and fruit production as a function of flower size\nAnalyses of absolute (unscaled) log-transformed values of\nmaximum potential flower production yielded a single most likely\nmodel (Table S1a Supplementary Information), in which flower\nproduction declined as a function of flower size for the comparison\nof 11 species (F1,7 = 35.88, P=0.0005, Fig. 2a). In this model\ncanopy species had lower values of unscaled maximum flower\nproduction than emergent species (F1,7 = 57.05, P=0.0001), and\nthe interaction between life form and flower size was also\nsignificant (F1,7 = 21.81, P=0.0023). Analyses of maximum flower\nproduction scaled to tree size yielded three most likely models\n(Table S1a Supplementary Information). In all three cases scaled\nmaximum flower production declined significantly with increasing\nflower size (e.g. F1,7 = 70.39, P,0.0001 for the model with the\nlowest AIC value, Fig. 2b)), but there was no difference between\ncanopy and emergent species (F1,7 = 1.71, P=0.23) and no\ninteraction of life form and flower size (F1,7 = 2.13, P=0.18).\nIn contrast to flower production (where small flowered species\nproduce more flowers than larger flowered species), there was not\na significant effect of flower size in any of the three most likely\nmodels analysing absolute values of maximum fruit production\n(Fig. 2c) or in the single most likely model of maximum fruit\nproduction scaled to tree size (Fig. 2d). Emergent species had a\nmarginally greater value of maximum absolute fruit production\nthan canopy species (Fig. 2c), and this term was significant in one\nof the three most likely models for this variable, but there was no\ndifference between canopy and emergent species in maximum\nfruit production scaled to tree size (Fig. 2d). The nearest neighbour\ndistance term was non-significant in all analyses of fruit production\namong species. The relationships between flower size and fruiting\nvariables and pollination success (median number of pollen tubes\nper pollinated flower) were all supported by phylogenetically\nindependent contrasts. Of the 12 species used in this study, only\neight species exist in well resolved phylogenies [33,34]. With the\nexception of S. xanthophylla all the Shorea species in our sample fall\nwithin the Red Meranti clade [34], with no apparent phylogenetic\nsignal of calyx size.\nPollination success\nAnalyses of the proportion of flowers pollinated identified five\nmost likely models (Table S1c, Supplementary Information), but in\nall cases a positive effect of flower size was the only significant term\n(F1,7 = 55.97, P,0.001, Fig. 2e). Similarly, flower size was the only\nsignificant term in all the five most likely models analysing\ninterspecific differences in the mean number of pollen tubes per\npollinated flower (F1,9 = 45.72, P,0.0001, Fig. 2f). Differences in\nlife form and in median nearest neighbour distance were not\nsignificant in these models of pollination success among species.\nPollinator body size\nThe experimental exclusion of pollinators based on body size\nresulted in a significant decline in pollination success with\nincreasing flower size (t=26.18, P,0.0001, Fig. 2). In small-\nflowered species (1.0\u20132.0 mm), such as Shorea xanthophylla,\nrestricting access to pollinators had very little effect on the\nproportion of fruit produced relative to that expected among open\npollinated flowers. In contrast, in the largest flowered species\nDipterocarpus grandiflorus fruit set within treatments that limited\npollinator access to small bodied insects was substantially reduced\nunder all mesh sizes (Fig. 3 see Dg). The response to mesh bag\ntreatments was significant (t=2.76, P=0.011), but the interaction\nof flower size and mesh bag treatment was not significant.\nPollen dispersal distance and genetic relatedness\nbetween assigned parents\nPaternity analysis revealed that short-distance mating events\nwere far more common among the smaller flowered species S.\nxanthophylla (47% of matings within 50 m and 71% within 100 m\nof the mother tree) than the larger flowered species P. tomentella\n(13% within 50 m and 32% within 100 m) (x2 = 17.96, P,0.001).\nThe median (Wilcox rank sum =7325, P,0.0001) and mean\n(t=24.609, P,0.0001) pollen dispersal distances for all assigned\nFlower Size Trade-Offs in Tropical Tree Species\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 February 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 2 | e16111\nprogeny showed a similar pattern: 63 m and 119 m in S.\nxanthophylla and 164 m and 177 m in P. tomentella respectively.\nBecause the density of potential pollen donors within 100 m of\nmother trees was generally greater for S. xanthophylla than P.\ntomentella, we also tested for differences in pollen dispersal between\nthe two species using a subset of mother trees that had equivalent\ndistances to nearest flowering neighbours. In the subset of S.\nxanthophylla mothers, 32 percent of matings were assigned at less\nthan 50 m and 34 percent at less than 100 m. The results of the\nTWOGENER analysis of pollen dispersal are summarised in\nTable 1. The differentiation in the pollen gene pool is significant in\nboth species (P,0.01) and almost twice as great in S. xanthophylla\nthan in P. tomentella (0.0624 and 0.0364 respectively). In this\nanalysis the mean pollen dispersal distance for S. xanthophylla was\nestimated at 56 m (S.E. 2.88) and for P. tomentella 416 m (S.E.\n29.93). The effective number of pollen donors per mother tree\n(Nep) was 8.01 in S. xanthophylla and 13.73 in P. tomentella (Table 1).\nThe effective pollen neighbourhood area (Aep) ranged from 1.46 ha\n(Aep\nmin) 214.62 ha (Aep\nmax) in S. xanthophylla and from 8.43 ha\n(Aep\nmin) 284.26 ha (Aep\nmax) in P. tomentella (Table 1).\nGenetic relatedness between mothers and assigned fathers was an\norder of magnitude higher in progeny of the small-flowered species\nS. xanthophylla than in the larger flowered species P. tomentella (mean\npairwise kinship coefficient = 0.033 (S.E. 0.008) and 0.002 (S.E.\n0.01) respectively; t=2.195, df = 229, P=0.028). The mating\nsystem parameters based upon the progeny arrays indicate that\nboth species are extensively outcrossing (tm=0.996 and tm=0.907 in\nS. xanthophylla and P. tomentella respectively). However, the parental\ninbreeding coefficient and biparental inbreeding were both greater\nin S. xanthophylla (see supporting information Table S2).\nFigure 1.

Although canopy species\nproduced fewer flowers for their flower size than predicted by the\nscaling relationship for emergent species, all species fit the same\nnegative relationship when flower production was scaled to tree\nsize. These relationships suggest that the trade-off between flower\nsize and potential flower production was consistent across all\nspecies, but subject to allometric constraints. These observations\nare robust to phylogenetic comparison These results are consistent\nwith other studies that suggest that a flower size vs number trade-\noff is common in angiosperms [7,35]. Maximum fruit production\nper tree, in contrast to flower production, did not scale negatively\nwith flower size. This indicates that the potential fecundity offered\nby a large number of small flowers was offset by the reduced\nlikelihood that each of these flowers would be pollinated and\ndevelop into a mature fruit. Our results suggest that processes\noperating between flower production and fruit dispersal contribute\nto equalising fecundity among dipterocarp species. Below we\ninterpret our findings and discuss the range of alternative\nhypotheses that could lead to the observed patterns of fecundity.\nFruit production in larger fruited species could be resource\nlimited, leading to larger fruits being produced in fewer numbers\n[11]. However, we exclude this hypothesis for two reasons. First,\nthe scaling relationships were determined for trees representing the\nupper quartile for flower production, which are least likely to be\nresource-limited among the sample. Secondly, fruit size scales\npositively with flower size in dipterocarps (C.R. Maycock et al.,\nunpubl. data), therefore small-flowered species would have lower\noverall per capita fruit mass, even though fruit number remains\nthe same, a scenario that is at odds with the expectations of\nresource limited fruit production.\nExperimental exclusion of all potential pollinators except thrips\nreduced pollination success in large-flowered but not small-\nflowered species. This result suggests that the role of thrips in\npollination is important for small-flowered species of dipterocarp\nsuch as Shorea xanthophylla but less so as flower size increases. Thrips\nare abundant in the flowers of all the dipterocarps examined in this\nstudy and are widespread in the flowers of many non-dipterocarps\nin the same forest (C.R. Maycock, et al. unpubl. data). Hence their\nabundance is unlikely to limit pollination success in the small-\nflowered species, and therefore we reject pollinator limitation as a\ndeterminant of the flower size-dependent reduction in pollination\nsuccess.\nFigure 2.

First, our examination of pollen tube\ngrowth among species showed that both the proportion of\npollinated flowers and mean number of pollen tubes per pollinated\nflower was greater in larger-flowered species. This implies that\neither smaller-flowered species receive fewer per capita visits by\npollinators than larger-flowered species, and\/or that a higher\nproportion of pollination events result in the transfer of non-\ncompatible self-pollen that is blocked at the stigmatic surface or at\nthe early stages of pollen tube growth. Dipterocarp species are\nconsidered to be self-incompatible [28], and although there is\nevidence that selfing can lead to fruit production, these fruit are\npreferentially aborted at an early stage of maturation [36,37].

The exception to this\npattern was the largest flowered species, Dipterocarpus grandiflorus,\nwhich had significantly reduced fruit set even with the largest mesh\n(5 mm). This outcome suggests that the importance of larger\npollinators increases as flower size increases and, for the largest\nflowered species, D. grandiflorus, pollinators that exceed 5 mm in\nsize, such as giant honey bees Apis dorsata, large scarabid beetles\nand Sphingidae and Noctuidae moths, play an important role. We\nconclude that the role of small-bodied insects in dipterocarp\npollination, in particular thrips, declines with increasing flower\nsize. The relevance of this finding in the context of putative trade-\noffs is that the larger bodied pollinators may transfer pollen over\ngreater distances and may therefore be more effective agents for\noutcrossing [13,39].\nDifferential pollen dispersal. Our study provides evidence\nthat larger bodied pollinators disperse pollen over greater distances\nthan smaller bodied pollinators in dipterocarps. Our paternity\nanalysis and indirect estimates of pollen dispersal demonstrated\nthat short-distance pollen dispersal events were more frequent, and\nthat the mean pollen dispersal distance were shorter, for the small-\nflowered species Shorea xanthophylla than for Parashorea tomentella,\nindependent of density of flowering conspecifics. Progeny collected\nfrom a subset of S. xanthophylla mother trees with an equivalent\ndensity of flowering conspecifics to that of P. tomentella were\nassigned more frequently to nearer pollen donors (,100 m) than\nfor P. tomentella. Other studies have estimated mean pollen\ndispersal distances in dipterocarp species to lie in the range 175\u2013\n207 m [22,25,26]. For the five dipterocarp species where pollen\ndispersal distances have been quantified, representing flower sizes\nranging over two orders of magnitude, mean pollen dispersal\ndistance increases with flower size, with the lowest mean dispersal\ndistances in S. xanthophylla and greatest dispersal distances in\nDipterocarpus tempehes (Table 2). Such a pattern remains\ninconclusive, as it is based on only five species, and other factors\nmay influence pollen-mediated gene flow, including differences in\nthe density of flowering conspecifics. Nevertheless, the results are\nsuggestive that increasing flower size corresponds to higher pollen\nflow distances, which we interpret as being mediated by the larger-\nbodied pollinators attracted by the larger flowers. Hence, all else\nbeing equal, these larger-flowered species experience higher\noutcrossing rates and are less susceptible to inbreeding. This\ncorresponds to a higher quality of pollination service for large\nflowered species, which compensates for the relatively few flowers\nproduced by these species.\nInbreeding and thus reduced fecundity through inbreeding\ndepression are predicted to be greater in species where related\nindividuals are highly aggregated. Seed dispersal limitation and\nhabitat specialisation are common in dipterocarps [30,31], and\nboth processes can lead to aggregation of related individuals\n[40,41,42]. This is measurable as fine-scale spatial genetic\nstructure (SGS) within populations. A strong SGS signal would\nnot be expected if gene flow by pollen or seed dispersal is\nextensive. Dipterocarp seed dispersal is known to occur over short\ndistances [43,44,45,46,47], which suggests that long distance\npollen flow is likely to be the primary agent undermining SGS.\nThe evidence for fine-scale SGS observed in comparable studies of\ndipterocarp species [11,26,29,32,48,49] suggests that SGS is\ncommon in the Dipterocarpaceae, but weaker in larger flowered\nspecies. This interpretation is consistent with our pollinator\nexclusion experiments, and other studies [25,50,51] that identify\nthe importance of large insects such as Apis dorsata and sphingid\nmoths for pollination of large-flowered dipterocarps.\nSignificant fine-scale SGS combined with limited pollen\ndispersal may impose a fitness cost due to elevated inbreeding\ndepression or incompatible matings in self-incompatible species\n(Fig. 1), and this is likely to be more substantial among smaller\nflowered species for the reasons given above. Such processes would\nlead to a genetic cost under limited pollen dispersal and is\nsupported by evidence of a higher frequency of matings between\nmore closely-related individuals in the smaller-flowered species\nShorea xanthophylla than in Parashorea tomentella. High neighbourhood\ngenetic relatedness has been shown to interact with density to\nincrease the proportion of aborted fruit in the insect pollinated\ntropical tree Jacaranda copaia [41], which supports our hypothesis\nthat genetic processes contribute to the trade-off between flower\nsize and pollination success (Fig. 1).\nDifferential Fecundity. As a component of plant fitness,\nfecundity is represented in many models of population persistence\nand species coexistence [52,53,54,55]. However, empirical\ninvestigations of coexistence in tropical trees have focused more\non plant responses to abiotic resource availability [56,57,58].\nThese studies do not support an unequivocal role for habitat\npartitioning in the maintenance of the diverse tropical tree\ncommunities observed in Borneo. While our study is limited to\nonly a few species, it does highlight the potential importance of\npartitioning of the pollinator niche as an important biotic resource,\nand also provides the basis for postulating a series of trade-offs\n(depicted in Figure 1) linking fruit production to flower size, flower\nnumber and pollination systems within the Dipterocarpaceae.\nThese mechanisms may well contribute to equalisation of\nfecundity among species, and warrant further investigation as a\nnovel mechanism for promoting coexistence.\nConservation implications\nOur findings have implications for the conservation of genetic\nand species level diversity. First, our results highlight the potential\nfor differential vulnerability of species to inbreeding, genetic drift\nand pollen limitation as a result of habitat fragmentation\n[15,59,60]. Larger-flowered dipterocarps may be less vulnerable\nto fragmentation as larger-bodied pollinators have a greater\nTable 2.

Second, the\ngenetic processes invoked here also have clear implications for\ntropical forest restoration, and specifically the collection of seeds\nfor generating planting stock. The genetic diversity of seed\ncollections from small flowered species may be more vulnerable\nto cryptic processes, such as an elevated proportion of inbred\nprogeny, which may compromise the long-term viability of\nforest restoration [63]. Hence we emphasise the importance of\nmaintaining the integrity of pollinator communities and\ndispersal corridors between forest fragments for tropical forest\nconservation.\nConclusions\nOur study suggests that a trade-off exists between flower size\nand number that, coupled with a positive scaling between flower\nsize and pollination success, reduces the variance in per tree fruit\nproduction between species. We have shown that species with\nsmall flowers produce them in greater numbers, but these flowers\nare pollinated by small-bodied insects that are less likely to disperse\npollen over long distances. This gives rise to limited gene flow by\npollination and, coupled with adult populations with strong spatial\ngenetic structuring, increases the likelihood of mating between\nrelated individuals in small-flowered species. As mean flower size\nincreases across species, flower number per tree declines, but the\nlikelihood of receiving pollen from unrelated (more distant)\nconspecifics increases because larger-bodied pollinators such as\nsphingid moths and Apis dorsata become increasingly important as\npollinators. Thus a trade-off embedded in the relationship between\nflower size and the pollination ecology of co-occurring tropical\ntrees contributes to reducing variance in per capita fecundity\namong species and life-forms. Although we cannot infer that\nfecundity relates directly to life-time mean fitness, seed production\nis an important component of plant reproductive success.\nInbreeding has been shown to have direct implications on\ndifferential seed mass in dipterocarps [64] and germination rates\nand survival in other tropical tree species [65,66,67]. It is therefore\nplausible that these processes reduce fitness inequalities among\nspecies and thereby delay competitive exclusion. This perspective\nsuggests that partitioning of pollinators may contribute to\nmaintaining the diversity of species in this ecologically and\neconomically important family of tropical trees, and that the\npollination component of the regeneration niche may play a more\nsubstantial role in maintaining species diversity than has been\nrecognised previously.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy site and species\nThe study site was the Sepilok Forest Reserve (SFR: 5u479\u2013\n5u529 N, 117u559\u2013118u039 E), which is about 24 km west of the\nstate capital of Sandakan on the east coast of Sabah, Malaysia (SI\nFig. S1). SFR is a \u2018\u2018Class VI virgin jungle reserve\u2019\u2019 gazetted in\n1930, managed by the Forest Research Centre Sabah for forest\nprotection and research. SFR supports lowland dipterocarp and\nheath forest (described by Fox [68]). Mean annual temperature\nfalls in the range of 26.7\u201327.7uC and mean annual rainfall is\n29296134 mm (Malaysian Meteorological Service, unpubl. data).\nFlower size, flower number and fruit production\nWe examined the trade-offs among flower size and total flower\nand fruit production across 12 dipterocarp species during two\nminor flowering events between July 2001 and November 2002\nsupplemented by information obtained during flowering events in\n2006\u20132008 (Table 3). Mean flower size of these species, measured\nas calyx tube diameter on an average sample of 700 flowers per\nspecies from 6 to 55 individuals, varied in the range 1.2 mm\u2013\n10.2 mm (Table 3). Flowering trees were located using binoculars\nalong an extensive trail system, in an area of approximately 640\nha. A mean of 22 trees were sampled for each species (Table 3).\nDiameter at breast height (dbh) and crown width were measured\nfor each tree, and their positions were recorded using a GPS\n(Magellen 315, Thales Navigation, Santa Clara, USA). Similarly,\nthe nearest two flowering neighbours for each tree sampled were\nlocated and their positions recorded as above. Phylogenetically\nindependent contrasts (PICs) were used to examine trade-offs\nbetween flower size and total flower production, pollination\nsuccess, the mean number of pollen tubes per pollinated flower or\nmaximum total fruit production to take account of phylogenetic\ninertia within closely related species [69]. We applied the\nrelationships determined from a recent dipterocarp phylogeny\nusing PgiC gene sequence [34] which includes seven of the 12 study\nspecies. The PIC analysis was conducted using the computer\nprogram Compare 4.6b on the transformed variables [70].\nFollowing PIC analyses, the Y-variable contrasts were regressed\non the X-variable contrasts as outlined in [71].\nFour 1 m2 mesh traps raised 1 m above the ground were\ninstalled under each tree to estimate flower production. The traps\nwere placed approximately 5 m from the trunk, and at 90u\nintervals from a random azimuth. All traps were installed prior to\nthe commencement of flower fall and their contents were collected\nTable 3.

The\nsamples were air dried and sorted into fractions representing buds,\nflowers and fruit, and the fractions were counted and weighed.\nFlower counts were based on calyxes, which we presume to be\nsubjected to less lateral dispersal by wind than corollas. Total\nflower production was estimated by multiplying the total number\nof buds, flowers and fruit captured by the traps (expressed per m2)\nby the projected area of the tree crown. The flowering events we\nsampled for this paper were not general flowering events sensu\n[72], and a high proportion of flowering individuals produced only\na small number of flowers on relatively few branches. Such\nflowering events are thought to contribute very little to population-\nlevel fecundity [73]. Therefore we estimated mean maximum\nflower and fruit production from the upper quartile of values per\nspecies (n = 2\u201314 individuals per species). Because basal area alone\nis insufficient to account for differences in architecture and\nallometry among species and to account for effects of canopy\nexposure on flower production, we present values of maximum\nflower production scaled to tree size:\nScaled flower production~\nFlower production\nBasal area\n|\nMHE\nMHS\nwhere MHE\/MSE is a scaling factor for height calculated by\ndividing the maximum height of emergents at the study site (MHE:\n65 m) by the maximum height of the study species (MHS). Basal\narea was determined by direct measurement for each tree\nsampled. Maximum height of the emergent trees in the SFR\nand maximum height of each species were estimated to the nearest\n5 m using a measuring line dropped from the canopy. Total fruit\nproduction was estimated from the mean number of fruit captured\nper trap multiplied by the projected area of the tree crown.\nPollination success\nWe examined pollen tube growth as a measure of pollination\nsuccess in 11 of the same 12 dipterocarp species using flower\nsamples collected during 2001\u20132002 (H. beccariana, S. beccariana, S.\njohorensis, S. leprosula, S. macroptera, S. multiflora, S. parvifolia, S.\nsmithiana and S. xanthophylla,) or 2006\u20132008 (D. grandiflorus and P\ntomentella) (Table 3). Flower samples were obtained using mixed\nrope-climbing techniques to gain access to the canopy. Inflores-\ncences were collected directly from each tree at five randomly\nselected locations within the crown. Flowers that had recently shed\ntheir corollas were removed from the inflorescences. We collected\na minimum of 500 flowers from each tree for the Shorea spp and H.\nbeccariana, while the low flower densities of D. grandiflorus and P.\ntomentella limited the sample to approximately 50 and 100 flowers\nper tree, respectively. All flowers were stored in formalin-acetic-\nalcohol (FAA). Mean calyx diameters for each tree were\ndetermined from direct measurement on 25 randomly selected\nflowers. The styles of the flowers were stained with 1 percent\naniline blue solution and the number of pollen tubes in each were\ndetermined using fluorescence microscopy as outlined in Ghazoul\net al., [21]. We examined pollen tubes within 25200 flowers\nsampled randomly from the flower collections taken from a total of\n638 individuals of the 11 species.\nPollinator body size\nMesh bags were used to exclude visitors from inflorescences\nprior to anthesis on 2\u20136 trees from each of nine of the 12 study\nspecies that represented an order-of-magnitude range in flower\nsize and flowered between May 2006 and May 2008 (Table 1).\nTen replicate inflorescences per tree were used for each of the\nfollowing treatments: (a) open pollination (no mesh); (b) exclusion\nof large pollinators (5 mm mesh); (c) exclusion of medium-sized\nand large pollinators (2 mm mesh); and (d) exclusion of all\npollinators except thrips (0.2 mm mesh). Control large mesh bags\ncontaining fly trap paper confirmed that large mesh bags did not\ninhibit visitation by smaller pollinators. The bags were removed at\nthe end of anthesis. Fruit initiation and development were\nmonitored every five days throughout the first month, and then\nevery 10 days until fruit maturity. The effect of mesh bag\ntreatments is expressed as percent pollination success relative to\nthe open pollination treatment one month after anthesis.\nPollen dispersal distances\nPollen dispersal distance was estimated using paternity analysis\nbased on samples of mature fruit collected from known mother\ntrees of Shorea xanthophylla (mean calyx diameter 1.2 mm) and\nParashorea tomentella (mean calyx diameter 4.6 mm). These species\nwere selected because this contrast in flower size was predicted to\ngenerate differences in pollen dispersal distance based on our\nsampling of their flower visitor communities (C.R. Maycock et al.,\nunpubl. data), and because their densities of flowering individuals\nmaximised sampling effort for the available resources. We applied\nidentical sampling strategies in both species, combining the\ngenotypes of mother and progeny with genotypes from all\npotential pollen donors in mapped populations within 500 m of\neach mother trees. Because flowering tree density can have a high\nvariance, both within and among species, our sampling design\nenables us to explicitly control for this.\nDNA sampling, extraction and genotyping. All sampling\nwas carried out between April 2006 and September 2008. 20\u201335\nmature fruits were sampled from each of 20 and 17 mother trees of\nShorea xanthophylla and Parashorea tomentella respectively. Fresh fruits\nwere dissected and embryos removed and dried in SigmaTM silica\ngel prior to DNA extraction. In addition to sampling inner bark\nfrom each mother tree, inner bark was sampled from all flowering\ncon-specifics within a 500 m radius of each mother and the\nlocation of all adult trees recorded with a GPS. For adult trees,\nfresh inner bark (cambium) was collected using a 2 cm diameter\nleather punch and a hammer following Colpaert et al. [74]. The\nfresh samples were placed in labelled tea bags and dried in\nSigmaTM silica gel within 12 hours of sampling, and stored under\nthe same conditions prior to DNA extraction. Total genomic DNA\nwas extracted from approx. 0.03 g of silica dried material (inner\nbark, embryo or leaf, depending on sample type) and ground to a\nfine powder using a Qiagen Mixer-millTM with Retsch \u0002 stainless\nsteel \u2018cone balls\u2019 and the Qiagen DNAeasyTM 96-well-plate plant\nextraction system. For the paternity analysis the genotype of each\nmother tree, candidate father and embryo was determined at nine\npolymorphic, genomic, nuclear microsatellite loci. Primers are\nsummarised in Supplementary Information Table S3. The\nforward primer of each locus was 5- prime end labelled with\none of four florescent-labelled dyes (FAM, NED, PET or VIC) to\nenable multiplexing of multiple loci during fragment analysis. All\nPCR products were quantified using an ABI 3730xl DNA\nAnalyser (Applied Biosystems) and sample genotypes scored\nusing Genemapper v.4.0TM software (Applied Biosystems).\nTo establish whether data from different microsatellite loci were\nindependent, genotypic linkage disequilibrium was tested between\nall pairs of loci within each species adult sample using GENEPOP\n4.0 [75] with the following settings; dememorization: 1000, batch:\n100, iteration per batch: 5000. No evidence for significant linkage\ndisequilibrium was detected.\nDirect estimates of pollen dispersal. Mother trees were\nsampled based upon the abundance of fruits and accessibility.\nUsing multilocus genotypes (9 loci, see Table S3 Supporting\nFlower Size Trade-Offs in Tropical Tree Species\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 February 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 2 | e16111\ninformation) of progeny and known mother trees we applied a\nmaximum likelihood exclusion analysis in CERVUS 3.0, to\nexclude candidate fathers [76,77]. Candidate fathers were defined\nas all flowering conspecifics within a 500 m radius of each mother\ntree. Pollen dispersal distance was deduced for each embryo based\non the position of the mother tree and the assigned pollen parent\n(father) within the 500 m radius. Simulations of paternity were run\nusing the allele frequencies of all adult reproductive trees and the\nfollowing settings: 10000 cycles; minimum number of loci typed 5,\nmothers as known parents, test for selfing (i.e., mothers also\nincluded as candidate fathers); the flowering conspecifics within\n500 m of each mother were set as the candidate fathers for\nprogeny from that mother only; 1 percent for proportion of loci\nmistyped, and 87 percent for proportion of loci genotyped. The\nproportion of candidate fathers sampled was set at 80 percent,\nwhich was considered a conservative estimate based upon the\nobserved frequency of flowering conspecifics across the entire\nSFR. Assignment was based upon the 80% confidence level of the\ncritical LOD score.\nBased upon paternity assignment, 68 percent of progeny (310 of\n456) from 20 mothers trees of S. xanthophylla and 26 percent of\nprogeny (106 of 408) from 17 mother trees of P. tomentella could be\nassigned with an 80% confidence within 500 m of the mother tree.\nFor all progeny that could not be assigned at this level of\nconfidence the pollen donors were assumed to be beyond a 500 m\nradius of each mother tree. This assumption would be supported\nby evidence that the gene pool of the genotyped progeny differed\nsignificantly from that of the pollen donor pool within the 500 m\nradius. To test this we examined the frequency of rare alleles\n(abundance ,0.01) in the embryo cohorts of each species. In P.\ntomentella 92 percent of the rare alleles (,0.01) are observed only in\nthe embryos, not in the mothers or neighbouring adults, thus must\nhave come from outside the 500 m radius we sampled. In contrast\nin S. xanthophylla only 49 percent of rare alleles were unique to the\nembryo cohort.\nIndirect estimate of pollen dispersal. Pollen dispersal was\nalso evaluated using the TWOGENER [78,79] approach with\nPOLDISP [80]. TWOGENER estimates the heterogeneity of the\npollen gene pool sampled within a set of maternal trees (W FT)\nusing AMOVA [81]. This has the added advantage that it\nprovides an estimate of contemporary gene flow over the scale of\nthe landscape which is less sensitive to flowering tree density and\ncomplementary to the more localised estimate of the paternity\nanalysis. The mean effective pollen dispersal distance (d) was\ncalculated assuming the following dispersal models; normal,\nbivariate normal and anisotropic normal, following [79,82,83] in\nS. xanthophylla and P. tomentella. The density of adult trees was\ncalculated using our detailed spatial distribution data of our focal\nspecies within SFR (Table 1). The effective number of pollen\ndonors Nep and effective pollination neighbourhood area (A\u02c6ep) were\ncalculated as follows: Nep= 1\/2Wft and A\u02c6e = Nep\/de where de is the\neffective density of trees. We used a range of values of de including\nthose derived from the TWOGENER analysis. Because the\neffective density of flowering adults may vary markedly from year\nto year we calculated Nep assuming a range of densities based upon\nthe census density of reproductive adults (d) and d\/2, d\/4 and d\/10\nfollowing the approach of [84] after [79].\nInbreeding of progeny\nThe relatedness between mothers and putative fathers, derived\nfrom the paternity analysis, was estimated for each of the assigned\nprogeny using SPAGEDI 1.2 g [85]. Here we calculated the\nindividual and mean kinship coefficient F [86] for each parent pair\nassigned by CERVUS [76] within S. xanthophylla and P. tomentella\n(n = 229 and 106 respectively). Mean kinship coefficients F have\nbeen used to express the relatedness between mating individuals in\nants [87] and are useful as they are directly comparable to\nmeasures of spatial genetic structure among species. We\nsupplement the measures of relatedness between mating pairs\nwith estimates of the number of pollen donors per seed crop (Nep)\nand multilocus outcrossing estimates using the program MLTR v\n2.4 [88].\nStatistical analysis\nLinear models were used to investigate trade-offs among species\u2019\nbetween log-transformed flower size and: (1) log-transformed\nmaximum flower production; (2) arcsine-transformed percentage\nof flowers pollinated; (3) log-transformed mean number of pollen\ntubes per pollinated flower; and (4) log-transformed maximum\nfruit production. We included life-form (canopy or emergent\nfollowing Ashton [89]), as an additional independent variable in all\nmodels. For analyses of pollination success and fruit production (2\u2013\n4) we also included median values of the mean distance to the two\nnearest flowering trees (for pollination success) or fruiting trees (for\nfruit production) as an independent variable to account for\npossible effects of differences between species in the density of\nreproductive trees. We compared models containing all possible\ncombinations of one or more explanatory variables and their\ninteractions and used AIC values to select the most likely models.\nModels with AIC values that differed by less than two were judged\nequally valid [90] but F statistics and probability values reported in\nthis paper are taken from the model with the lowest AIC value.\nThe effects of pollinator exclusion on pollination success were\nanalysed using a generalised linear model with log-transformed\ncalyx diameter and mesh bag treatment as fixed explanatory\nvariables. The non-significant interaction term was removed from\nthe model. Pollination success was expressed as the proportion of\nfruits within each treatment surviving to one month after the end\nof anthesis, relative to open pollination.\nTo test the null hypothesis of no difference in the frequency of\nshort distance mating we conducted a chi-squared test on counts of\npollen dispersal within distance classes ,50 m, 50\u201399.9 m, 100\u2013\n199.9 m and 200\u2013500 m in S. xanthophylla and P. tomentella.\nAverage pollen dispersal distances over all assigned embryos were\ncompared between S. xanthophylla and P. tomentella using a Student\nt-test (arithmetic mean) and Wilcox test (median). To determine\nthe significance of inbreeding of progeny as a function of flower\nsize we used a Student t-test to test the null hypothesis of no\ndifference in mean kinship coefficient. All statistics were conducted\nusing R (R Development Core Team 2009).\nSupporting Information\nFigure S1 Location of Sepilok Forest Reserve, boundary\ndemarked by orange line together with distribution of flowering\ntrees of Parashorea tomentella and Shorea xanthophylla used for paternity\nanalysis in.
