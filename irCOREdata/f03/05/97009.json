J. CHAPMAN\nMathematical Institute, 24-29 St Giles', Oxford OX1 3LB, UK\n[Received 7 February 1994 and in revised form 27 September 1994]\nThe linear stability of two travelling waves describing phase changes in supercon-\nducting materials is examined. The first describes the change of phase between\nnormally conducting and superconducting states in a type I superconductor, while\nthe second describes the transition from the superconducting state to the mixed\nstate in a type II superconductor.\n1. Introduction\nThis paper is concerned with the stability of various phase changes in supercon-\nducting materials.\nThe response of a superconducting material to an applied magnetic field is\nconveniently described by Fig. 1, which shows the preferred state of the\nsuperconductor as a function of Ho, the applied magnetic field, and K, a material\nparameter (known as the Ginzburg-Landau parameter) which determines the\ntype of superconducting material: K < 1\/\/2 describes what is known as a type I\nsuperconductor, K > 1\/\/2 describes what is known as a type II superconductor.\nFor type I superconductors there is a critical magnetic field Hc (known as the\nthermodynamic critical field) below which the material will be in the supercon-\nducting state, but above which it will revert to the normally conducting (normal)\nstate. The transition between normal and superconducting states as the applied\nmagnetic field is raised or lowered through Hc takes place by means of phase\nboundaries separating normal regions from superconducting regions sweeping\nthrough the material. In [3] and [7] the following free-boundary problem for this\nchange of phase was derived:\nV2\/\/ = ^ infln, (1)\nat\nH = 0 in A , (2)\n\\H\\ = HC on\/\\ (3)\ncurl\/\/A\/i= -vji onf , (4)\nwhere H is the magnetic field, i^ is the normal region, fl, is the superconducting\nregion, F is the free boundary separating these two regions (approached from the\nnormal region), n is the unit normal to F (directed towards the superconducting\nregion), and un is the normal velocity of F.\nExperimental evidence [9,10] seems to indicate that the switch-off of a\nsuperconducting wire (i.e. the transition from superconducting to normal) is a\n159\n\u00a9 Oxford Umvernty Preo 1995\n160 S.

In the next section we consider the linear\nstability of this solution.\nFor type II superconductors a third state exists, which is known as the mixed\nstate. The mixed state, as its name suggests, is neither wholly superconducting nor\nwholly normal, but consists of many normal filaments embedded in a supercon-\nducting matrix. Each of these filaments carries with it a quantized amount of\nmagnetic flux, and is circled by a vortex of superconducting current (thus these\nfilaments are often known as vortices).\nThe transition from the normal state to the mixed state takes place via a\nbifurcation as the magnetic field is lowered through some critical value H&\n(known as the upper critical field), and is described in [1,2,4,11,12,14]. This\nbifurcation is subcritical for type I superconductors, but supercritical for type II\nsuperconductors; hence the observation of the mixed state only for type II\nsuperconductors.\nThe magnetic field at which the superconducting state begins its transition to\nSTABILITY OF TRAVELLING WAVES IN SUPERCONDUCTIVITY 161\nthe mixed state has been studied in [5]. In [6,8] a model was derived to describe\nthe mixed state of a superconductor in which the vortices are averaged to give a\nvortex density, or vorticity. The change of phase from the superconducting state\nto the mixed state as vortices sweep through the sample can also be described by\nthis model. The following equations were obtained\u2014in two dimensions, with\nH=(0,0,H(x,y,t)):\nin Om, (6)\nH - V2\/\/ =o> in Qm, (7)\nco = 0 in fl,, (8)\nH-V2H = 0 in A, (9)\n[H] = 0, (10)\n(ID\nr\\ JJ\nvn=-(sgnw) \u2014. (12)\nan\nHere Qn is the mixed region, i.e. the region occupied by the vortices, and, as\nbefore, \/2, is the superconducting region, F is the free boundary separating these\ntwo regions, n is the unit normal to F (directed toward the superconducting\nregion), un is the normal velocity of F and [ ] stands for the jump in the enclosed\nquantity across F\\ H is the (now scalar) magnetic field, and w is the vorticity.\nRecent experiments [16] indicate that, in the presence of strong vortex pinning,\nwhen a wave of positive vorticity sweeps though a sample originally full of\nnegative vorticity, the interface between the two regions is unstable and prone to\nfingering. With weaker pinning (obtained by increasing the temperature), the\nfingering seems to cease.\nThe model above describes the limit of no vortex pinning. Questions of interest\nare whether vortex fronts are stable in the absence of pinning, whether the\ninstability depends on the sample previously having been full of vortices of the\nopposite sign, and whether the fingering is due to inhomogeneities in the\nunderlying pinning forces, or is in fact due to a morphological instability of the\ninterface. Here we will attempt to answer the first of these questions, by\nconsidering the stability of an interface between superconducting and vortex\nstates in the clean (i.e. no pinning) limit. (We note that the model (6-12) can be\nmodified to incorporate the effects of vortex pinning, and we hope to investigate\nquestions of stability in this case in a later paper.)\nAgain, locally a smooth interface will be planar, so that we can gain insight into\nthe stability of an arbitrary interface by considering the stability of a planar one.\nA solution of (6-12) representing a plane wave travelling with constant velocity is\n162 S.

Note that in this case c is required to be positive\nin order to satisfy equation (12), so that (13,14) can only describe the transition\nfrom the superconducting to the mixed state and not vice versa.\n2. Linear stability\n2.1 Type I superconductors\nWe perform a linear stability analysis of the solution (5) by considering\nperturbations to the boundary, which is given by J: =s , of the form\ns(y, z,t) = ct + ee\"1 cos my cos nz, (15)\nwhere 0 < e \u00ab 1 , and m and n are real and positive for definiteness. The analysis\nis similar to that performed on the Stefan model in [13,15]. Indeed, when m = 0,\nthe two problems are identical since (1-4) reduces to a one-phase Stefan model in\nthe cylindrical case in which H = (0, H{x, z, t), 0). We will see that the vectorial\nnature of the present problem leads to a decrease in instability for m?*0, that is,\nthe growth rate of unstable modes decreases with increasing m.\nWe expand the solution for H in powers of e:\nH = (0,H<?\\0) + e H w + ---, (16)\nwhere H^} is the unperturbed solution given by (5). Substituting the expansion\n(16) into equation (1) and equating coefficients of e yields\nV2tf<'> = \u2014 . (17)\not\nWe will shortly change to coordinates moving with the free boundary, but we first\ncalculate the boundary conditions for \/\/*''. We have\n\\H(s, y, z)\\2 = \/\/c(l - 2ece<\" cos my cos nz) + 2eHcH^\\ct, y,z) + O(e2)\nby (3). Equating coefficients of e gives\nM1 \\ct, y,z) = cHfi1\" cos my cos nz.

If we require that H$> should be small compared to H\\0) = H^'^\"-^\nas x - ct \u2014* -oo, then we have either Re {A2} > -c or S = 0. In the first case the\nsolution would grow exponentially as x \u2014 ct \u2014\u00bb-oo, but would still be small\ncompared to the leading-order solution. In particular, if we were treating the\nproblem as an initial value problem such a solution would correspond to an initial\nperturbation which grows exponentially at infinity, while the eigenmodal case\n5 = 0 corresponds to an initial perturbation which decays at infinity. Of course,\na general initial perturbation will be a sum involving both types.\nIf Re{A2}>-c, then\nRe {c2 + 4(n2 + m2 + a)} < (Re {[c2 + 4(n2 + m2 + o-)]i})2 < c2,\nthat is,\nHence Re {a} is negative. If we have B = 0, then (31) implies A = cHc, which in\n(32) implies\nc[c2 + 4(n2 + m2 + <r)]l = - c 2 -la- 2m2. (33)\nSquaring gives\nc4 + 4C2(H2 + m2 + a) = c4 + Aa2 + 4m4 + Ac2a + 4c2m2 + 8am2,\nthat is,\nc\n2\nn\n2\n = (o- + m2)2.\nHence\na = -m\n2\u00b1nc. (34)\nHowever, since we had to square our equation to obtain this answer, we need to\nsubstitute (34) into (33) and check for consistency. We find\nthat is, c \u00b1 In < 0. Since c > 0 we must have\na = -m\n2\n-nc and 2n>c. (35)\nSince c is positive, we see that a is negative and the solution is linearly stable.\n(2) c<0 . If we again require that \/ \/2 n should be small compared 16\nHce~c{z'a) as x - ct\u2014* - oo, then we must have B = 0. As before a = -m2 \u00b1 nc,\nSTABILITY OF TRAVELLING WAVES IN SUPERCONDUCTIVITY 165\nwith c\u00b12n<0. Thus\n' - m\n2\n \u00b1nc il2n<\u2014c,\nm\n2\n-nc \\i2n>-c.\nHence, for n\/m2> -c there will be a solution with a>0 indicating an instability\nof the boundary.\nWe note the very different responses to perturbations in the y and z directions.\nWe see that for a perturbation in the y-direction only (n = 0) the boundary is\nalways stable. However, for a perturbation in the z-direction only (m =0) the\nboundary is stable if and only if c > 0, i.e. the normal region is advancing.\nFurthermore, when both perturbations are present, the perturbation in the\ny-direction serves to increase the stability of the perturbation in the z-direction\nwhen c>0 , and decrease the instability of the perturbation in the z -direction\nwhen c < 0.\nIn (1) we found that no mode solutions decaying at infinity were possible when\n2n<c (and yet such a perturbation may be applied to the system and it will\nevolve in time). A complete linear treatment for a given perturbation can be\nobtained by taking the Laplace transform in time, i.e. treating the problem as an\ninitial value problem. If this approach is carried out, we find that the free\nboundary is of the form\ncos my oos nz fT+icr\nx = a + T-. &e?' dp,\nZ7H J>-i\u00ab\nwhere the integrand & has poles at the roots of the dispersion relation (33). There\nis also a branch cut in the p plane from - \\ c 2 - n2 \u2014 m2 to \u2014\u00ab. When 2n <c, the\nsole contribution to the integrand comes from this branch cut. Since Re {p} > 0\nthere, this contribution decays with time.\nFollowing the same reasoning as for the Stefan problem, the instability of\nperturbations in the z-direction in the case c >0 can be explained physically by\nconsidering the effects of a small 'bump' on the boundary in the two-dimensional\ncase when H = (0, H(x, z, t), 0). When the normal region is expanding, such a\nbump will serve to lower locally the gradient of the magnetic field and hence\nreduce the velocity of the boundary in the vicinity of the bump, leading to\nstability. However, when the normal region is contracting, such a bump will\nincrease locally the gradient of the magnetic field and hence increase the velocity\nof the boundary, leading to instability.\nIn contrast to perturbations in the z-direction, perturbations in the y-direction\nrequire the bending of lines of magnetic field, since the magnetic field must\nalways be parallel to the interface. Such bending raises the energy associated with\nthe magnetic field, and it is this which causes perturbations in the y-direction to\ndecay.\nFinally, we consider which modes, i.e. which values of a, will actually be\nobserved in practice. In the case c < 0 the most unstable mode corresponds to\n(m, n) = (0, \u00b0=). Thus the modes observed will correspond to two-dimensional\nfingers (uniform in the y-direction). In the present model the wavelength of the\n166 S. J. CHAPMAN\nfingering would be zero. Adding a term proportional to curvature to equation (3),\ncorresponding to the surface energy associated with a normal\/superconducting\ndomain boundary (see [3]), would presumably stabilize the very short wave-\nlengths, and hence select the wavelength of the fingering.\nIn the stable case c > 0 the modes which have the smallest decay rate are those\ncorresponding to small values of m and n. Hence long-wavelength perturbations\nwill persist for a greater time than short-wavelength perturbations.\n2.2 Type II superconductors\nWe perform a similar analysis of the solution (13,14) by considering perturba-\ntions to the boundary of the form\ns = ct + ee\"1 cos ky. (37)\nWe expand the corresponding solution (a>, H) in powers of c:\nu> = (Oo + ea>1 + -- \u2022, H = HQ + eH1 + - \u2022\u2022, iorx<s, (38)\no) = 0, H = H0 + eHi+--, iorx>s, (39)\nwhere (<uo> #o) is the unperturbed solution given by (13,14). Substituting these\nexpansions into (6-9) and equating coefficients of e yields\nV(to0V\/\/1 a>1V\/\/0) forx<s, (40)\nof\n\/ \/ , - V 2 \/ \/ , ^ , forx<s, (41)\nHx -V 2 \/ \/ ,=0 forx>5. (42)\nAs before, we will shortly change to coordinates moving with the free boundary,\nbut we first calculate the boundary conditions on (40-42).\nWe have\n\/\/,(\u00ab, y,t)\u2014jf (ct, y, f)eOT cos ky j + O(e2). (43)\nEquating coefficients of e in (10) we find\nf9 =0, (44)\nOX J x - a -\nsince dHJdx is continuous across F. Similarly, equating powers of e in (11) yields\n= - c e \" cos ky.

(46)dx\nThus the problem we have is given by (40-42) with boundary conditions (44-46).\nWe seek a solution of the form\nw1 = e\nc\n\"cos^u(Tj), (47)\n#, = e\"'co5tyi;(T}), (48)\nwhere TJ = x \u2014 ct.

The solution of equation (51) which decays at infinity\nis\nv = a e ^ \" ^ (TJ>0) . (55)\nSince u'(0+) = - a - c we have that a = (a + c)\/(l + k2)^. Eliminating u we\ntherefore have\n(a + c- cy))v\" -cv' + (cJt2rj - (1 + k2)cr - ck2)v = 0 (TJ < 0), (56)\n^ = (TW (57)\nv'(0)=-a, (58)\nv'->0 asrj-\u00bb-oc. (59)\nWe prove that er\u00ab\u00a30.

Since (56) implies that v cannot have a positive\nmaximum, v cannot satisfy this boundary condition at \u2014\u00bb, and we have a\ncontradiction. Thus the interface is linearly stable.\nThe transformation v = e~^\/(f), with f = 2k(crj \u2014 c \u2014 a), converts (56) into\nKummer's equation, from which we can obtain a (rather ungainly) dispersion\nrelation in terms of Whittaker functions.

Conclusions\nWe have examined the linear stability of planar travelling waves in two models\nfor phase changes in superconducting materials.\nTrie first was a model for type I superconductors, with the change of phase\nbeing between normal and superconducting states. We found that a plane wave\nwas stable if the normal region was expanding, but unstable if the superconduct-\ning region was expanding.\nThe second model described the change of phase from the superconducting\nstate to the mixed state in a type II superconductor. Here we found that a plane\nwave was stable to small perturbations.\nBoth these results agree qualitatively with experimental observations [9,10,16].\nIn a future paper we hope to extend the analysis of the mixed\nstate\/superconducting state transition to include the effects of vortex pinning. In\nthis case experimental observations indicate that the interface is prone to\nfingering [16], but it is unclear whether this is caused by a morphological\ninstability or by inhomogeneity in the underlying distribution of pinning sites.\nREFERENCES\n1.
