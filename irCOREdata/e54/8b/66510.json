Assuming a general scenario of a propagation model of variability,\nwith inverse Compton upscatering as the emission mechanism, we have considered a number\nof cases for the periodic modulation: modulation of the plasma heating rate, cooling rate by\nexternal soft photons, and the amplitude of the reprocessed component. We have computed\nvarious observational characteristics which can be compared to good quality data.

Consequently, their power spectra are broad,\nextending through a few decades in Fourier frequency (van der\nKlis 1995; Markowitz et al. 2003). Nevertheless, periodic, or quasi-\nperiodic components appear often in the lightcurves of the stellar\nsystems. Typically, these quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) contain\nonly a small fraction of total variability power, and are hardly, if at\nall, recognizable in lightcurves in the time domain. Usually, they\nare only clearly visible in power density spectra (PDS), where a\nlarge number of oscillations is co-added. The observed QPO fre-\nquencies range from Keplerian frequency near a surface of a neu-\ntron star (kilo-Hz QPO in some neutron star X\u2013ray binaries) to be-\nlow \u223c 0.1 Hz (review in Wijnands 2001).\nDespite the fact that a QPO component is almost never the\ndominant light curve component, their significance for our under-\nstanding of the accretion process should not be underestimated. In\naccreting black hole systems QPO features seem to appear pref-\nerentially when the state of the source is changing. For example,\nRutledge et al. (1999) found correlations between spectral state\ntransitions and QPO appearance in soft X\u2013ray transient sources in\nGinga data. Numerous works were devoted to study such corre-\nlations in good quality RXTE data (e.g., Cui et al. 1999; Kalemci\net al. 2004; Rodriguez et al. 2004). In many neutron star X\u2013ray\n\u22c6 e-mail: ptz@camk.edu.pl\nbinaries many long-lived QPO features were observed and studies\nof their time history revealed such interesting phenomena as satura-\ntion of QPO frequency with mass accretion rate (Kaaret et al. 1999)\nor \u201cparallel tracks\u201d phenomenon (van der Klis 2001 and references\ntherein). This latter phenomenon is a hysteresis effect similar to\nthat observed also on longer time scales in some black hole X-ray\nbinaries (Maccarone & Coppi 2003). QPO offer also a method to\nconstrain the mass of the central compact object, provided that their\nfrequency is identified with a physical frequency of the system.\nA variety of spectral\/timing behaviour, including several types\nof QPO, is shown by the black hole binary (BHB) system GRS\n1915+105. This is a peculiar source, most likely due to its high\nmass accretion rate (Sobolewska & \u02d9Zycki 2004; Done, Wardzin\u00b4ski\n& Gierlin\u00b4ski 2004). Recently, Miller & Homan (2005) noticed\nchanges in the intensity of the Fe K\u03b1 fluorescent line at 6.4 keV\nduring QPO period in this source. This is a potentially important\nclue to the origin of the periodicity, suggesting that variations oc-\ncur in the relative configuration of the cold reprocessing matter and\nthe X\u2013ray source.\nAll of these demonstrate the importance of understanding the\norigin of the QPO features. Of course, given the variety of QPO\ncomponents it is rather unlikely that a single mechanism could ex-\nplain all of them, despite correlations between different QPO fre-\nquencies (Belloni, Psaltis & van der Klis 2002).\nQPO models considered so far concentrated on identifying the\nfrequencies of oscillations (see, e.g., Lee, Abramowicz & Kluz\u00b4niak\n2004 and references therein, and a review of QPO models in Psaltis\n2001). Rather little attention was paid to the fact that it is the X\u2013ray\nemission, which is modulated. A notable exception is the paper by\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS\n2 P. T. \u02d9Zycki and M. Sobolewska\nGiannios & Spruit (2004), where a model of global oscillations of\nthe hot inner flow interacting with outer cool disc was constructed.\nOscillations are driven by feedback loop between heating the cool\ndisc by ions from the hot flow and cooling of the hot disc by soft\nphotons from the cool disc. The model predicts that r.m.s. variabil-\nity of the QPO is highest at lower energies, therefore creating a\nrather soft QPO spectrum.\nIn this paper we address the problem of QPO origin from\na complementary point of view, considering how such variable\nhard X\u2013ray emission may be generated. Assuming that the X\u2013ray\nare produced in the thermal (or hybrid thermal-nonthermal; Coppi\n1999) Comptonization process (review in Zdziarski & Gierlin\u00b4ski\n2004), we construct a number of geometrical\/phenomenological\nscenarios of oscillations. The main idea here is that \u2013 irrespectively\nof the physical mechanism \u2013 QPO may be driven by modulations of\nonly a few physical parameters which determine the Comptonized\nspectrum: plasma heating rate, cooling rate by soft photons, ampli-\ntude of the reflected component (feedback between the heating and\ncooling), or a temperature of soft seed photons. It is also possible\nthat a QPO is a simple geometrical effect of, for example, periodic\nobscuration of the source of emission. For each such case we pre-\ndict various energy and timing characteristics which could be com-\npared with observations. In particular, we emphasize the Fourier-\nfrequency resolved spectroscopy as an important tool (Miyamoto\net al. 1991; Revnivtsev, Gilfanov & Churazov 1999; \u02d9Zycki 2002;\n2003, hereafter Z03).\n2 THE MODEL\nThe general scenario for time variability considered in this paper is\na radial propagation model, as described in details in Z03 and \u02d9Zycki\n(2004). That is, we assume that X\u2013rays are produced by structures\npropagating radially inwards, towards the central compact object\n(Kotov, Churazov & Gilfanov 2001). Dissipation of gravitational\nenergy causes a flare of radiation as the structures are approaching\nthe center. The X\u2013rays are produced in inverse Compton process on\nthermal electrons, with the soft seed photons provided by optically\nthick cold accretion disc (review in Done 2002). Evolution of en-\nergy spectrum during a flare of radiation, from softer to harder, pro-\nduces hard X-ray time lags \u2013 commonly observed in these sources\n(Poutanen & Fabian 1999; review in Poutanen 2001). The model\nreproduces also the Fourier-frequency resolved spectra (f -spectra;\nRevnivtsev et al. 1999), which get harder with increasing Fourier\nfrequency, at least in low\/hard state of BHB (Z03). We employ\nthe idea of flare avalanches to generate lightcurves with PDS of a\ndoubly-broken power law form (Stern & Svensson 1996; Poutanen\n& Fabian 1999). The correlations between the flares (avalanches)\ngo some way towards explaining the flux-\u03c3 relation of Uttley &\nMcHardy (2001).\nWe note that the propagation model was formulated for\nlow\/hard state of BHB, whose spectral\/timing properties are known\nbest. QPO are mostly observed in softer\/brighter states of BHB.\nHowever, there is certainly a continuity of spectral\/timing proper-\nties when the sources make transitions between the states (see, e.g.,\nZdziarski & Gierlin\u00b4ski 2004; Done & Gierlin\u00b4ski 2004; Kubota &\nDone 2004), so it does seem reasonable to adopt the same general\nscenario for the soft states as well. On the other hand, data anal-\nyses do show differences between some timing properties in hard\nand soft states, for example in Fourier-frequency resolved spectra\n(Revnivtsev et al. 1999 for hard state; Sobolewska & \u02d9Zycki 2005\nfor soft state).\nThe flare of radiation is described by a specific time depen-\ndence of plasma heating rate, expressed as compactness parameter,\nl \u2261 (L\/D)(\u03c3T\/mec\n3), where L is the luminosity and D is the\ncharacteristic dimension of the emission region. We adopt the fol-\nlowing descriptions of lh (Z03),\nlh,0(t) = Ar(t)\n\u22122\n[\n1\u2212\n\u221a\n6\nr(t)\n]\n, 0 < t < tmax (1)\nwhich describes the dissipation of gravitational energy in an accret-\ning ring. Initial and final radial positions of the propagating struc-\ntures are denoted ri and rf , respectively. tmax is the duration of a\nflare, computed assuming motion of the emission region at a frac-\ntion of free-fall velocity (Z03).\nThe cooling of the plasma is described by cooling compact-\nness, ls. In the basic model the main source of soft photons is re-\nprocessing of hard X\u2013rays, which is described as (Z03),\nls(t) = NC(t)lh(t), (2)\nwhere C(t) has the meaning of a covering factor of the reprocess-\ning matter. It is described by\nC[r(t)] =\n{\n1 for r(t) > rtr\n[r(t)\/rtr]\n\u03b3 for r(t) < rtr,\n(3)\ni.e. it equals 1 when the emitting structure is above the cold disc,\nbut it gradually decreases to 0 approaching the black hole. The de-\ncline of C(r) below the truncation radius, rtr, has indeed to be\nrather gradual, as discussed in some detail in Z03; specifically the\nexponent is assumed \u03b3 = 2.\nAs indicated above, the idea for generating a QPO is then to\nimpose an additional periodic modulation of one or more of the\nabove time dependencies. For example, if the QPO were a result of\noscillations of the accretion disc, then irrespectively of physical ori-\ngin of the oscillations, they could affect the flux of soft photons, or\nthe temperature of the soft emission, T0, or the amplitude of the re-\nflected component, R, or some combinations of the above. This will\nproduce a definite signature in, for example, energy dependence of\nQPO strength, or, related quantity, energy spectra computed at the\nQPO frequency.\nThe Comptonized spectra are computed with the EQPAIR code\n(Coppi 1999). The code computes thermal and pair balance of a\nspherical plasma cloud, given the heating rate of the plasma and\ncooling rate by soft photons, and other necessary parameters. It\nthen computes the spectrum of emerging radiation. In our case, at\neach time step the heating and cooling compactnesses are calcu-\nlated from eq. (1) and (2) with the additional periodic modulation\nas detailed below, and the spectrum of emergent radiation is com-\nputed. The reprocessed component is then added to it, with relative\namplitude, \u2126\/2pi = C(t), where \u2126\/2pi is the solid angle of the\nreprocessor from the X\u2013ray source. Narrow Fe K\u03b1 fluorescent line\nis added to the Compton reflected continuum. Its energy is fixed at\n6.4 keV, while its equivalent width (EW) depends of the continuum\nslope ( \u02d9Zycki & Czerny 1994; Z03), roughly covering the range of\n1 to 1.3 keV.\nA sequence of spectra is computed with total duration of 256\nsec. with time step of 1\/32 sec. It is then analysed using standard\ntools of Fourier analysis. The f -spectra are computed as described\nin Revnivtsev et al. (1999) and \u02d9Zycki (2002). An implicit assump-\ntion here is that the radius of the flaring region is constant in time,\nthat is, the flare luminosity is represented by the compactness pa-\nrameter. One may imagine more complex models where both D\nand L vary, which may lead to luminosity\u2013spectrum relations dif-\nferent than those presented in this paper.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nX\u2013ray quasi-periodic oscillations 3\nFigure 1.

Solid curve is the time averaged spectrum, squares\n(green online) is the r.m.s. spectrum of the broad band noise component,\nwhile circles (red online) is the r.m.s. spectrum of the QPO. The QPO was\nmodeled by varying the amplitude of reflection only, and its r.m.s. spectrum\nreproduces the shape of the reflected component.\n3 RESULTS\nComputations are performed for a 10M\u2299 black hole system. Flare\nduration (travel time), \u03c4 , is generated from a probability distribu-\ntion P (\u03c4 ) \u221d \u03c4\u22121 between \u03c4min = 0.005 sec and \u03c4max = 2\nsec, so that the PDS roughly matches PDS of Cyg X-1 (Z03). Ini-\ntially, ri is set to 100Rg but it is set smaller for short flares, so\nthat the propagation velocity does not exceed the free-fall velocity.\nThe normalization constant in eq. (1) is such that the maximum of\nlh(t) = 100. The parameters are chosen so that the time average\nspectra are rather hard: normalization constant in eq. 2, N = 0.4,\nand rtr = 20Rg, which give final spectrum with \u0393 \u2248 1.8. The\nQPO frequency is assumed 1 Hz.\n3.1 A test case \u2013 modulation of reflection amplitude\nLet us consider first a simple case of modulation of amplitude of\nthe reprocessed component, \u2126\/2pi. That is, we use un-modified\neqs. (1), (2) and (3) to describe heating and cooling of the plasma,\nbut the reflection amplitude is\n\u2126\/2pi(t) = Aqpo sin\n2(2pifqpot+ \u03c6qpo), (4)\nwith Aqpo = 2 and fqpo = 0.5 Hz. We call it a test case because\nit is not a self-consistent situation in our model, since \u2126\/2pi should\nequal to the feedback function C(t). It does, nevertheless, demon-\nstrate well the meaning of the r.m.s. spectrum. The r.m.s. spectra\nwere obtained by first fitting to the PDS in each energy channel a\nmodel consisting of a doubly broken power law,\nP (f) = NP \u00d7\n{\nf0, if f 6 fb,1\nN1f\n\u22121, if fb,1 < f 6 fb,2\nN2f\n\u22122, if f > fb,2\n(5)\n(where N1 = fb,1 and N2 = fb,1fb,2 ensure continuity of P (f)),\nwith a Lorentzian QPO feature. Fitted parameters are the overall\nnormalization NP , two break frequencies fb,1, fb,2 and normal-\nization and width of the Lorentzian. The rms(E) are then simply\ncomputed as integrals over f of the continuum P (f) and the QPO.\nThe QPO r.m.s. spectrum plotted in Fig. 1 reproduces the energy\nspectrum of the process which generated the QPO.\n3.2 Modulation of the heating rate\nHere we consider periodic modulation of the heating rate, lh. The\nmotivation for this case comes from the description of broad band\nX\u2013ray power spectra as a sum of a number of Lorentzians (e.g.,\nMiyamoto et al. 1991; Nowak 2000). If taken seriously, it may be\ninterpreted that X\u2013rays (not only QPO) are emitted in the form\nof damped or forced oscillators. One might then imagine that a\nQPO is one of those oscillatory modes, of rather higher quality\nfactor than oscillations producing the broad band noise. Further-\nmore, Maccarone, Coppi & Poutanen (2000) demonstrated that in\nthe low\/hard state the flares have to be driven by the heating rate\nrather than cooling flux of soft photons. Specifically, we assume\nthen\nlh(t\u2212 t0) = lh,0(t\u2212 t0) [1 + Aqpo sin(2pifqpot+ \u03c6qpo)] , (6)\nwhere t0 is start time of a given flare. The time t is a global time,\nthus the above formula describes really a background modulation\nacting on a collection of flares, whose start time and durations\nare randomly generated from appropriate probability distributions\n(Z03). If the phase, \u03c6qpo, was constant, the modulation would be a\nperfectly periodic, thus producing a narrow feature in PDS. In or-\nder to produce a quasi-periodic modulation, we change the phase\nabruptly at random moments in time. Such a procedure is motivated\nby results of Morgan, Remillard & Greiner (1997), who found ran-\ndom walk of QPO phase in GRS 1915+105. Parameters Aqpo and\nfqpo are constant.\nOf crucial importance is the response of the soft flux, ls, to the\nmodulation of lh. In the basic model of Poutanen & Fabian (1999)\nthe soft flux comes only from reprocessing of hard X\u2013rays, which\nmeans that the former must respond coherently to the variations\nof the latter. This assumption was made so that the model repro-\nduces the spectral slope \u2013 reflection amplitude correlation observed\nin low\/hard state (Zdziarski, Lubin\u00b4ski & Smith 1999). However,\nin soft states the disc emission usually dominates the hard X-ray\nemission, therefore we have to allow for the possibility that they\nare at least partially independent. Consequently, we consider also\nthe situation where the soft flux might respond only to the flare of\nradiation, described by lh,0(t), but it does not respond to the quasi-\nperiodic component.\n3.2.1 Cooling rate responding to QPO\nHere we assume that the flux of soft photons cooling the plasma is\nrelated to the heating as\nls(t) = NC(t)\u00d7 lh(t), (7)\nthat is, the soft flux comes from reprocessing of the entire flux of\nhard X\u2013rays, including the quasi-periodic modulation. We assume\nthat any delay in the response of ls(t) is negligible. This is certainly\ncorrect for QPO of considered frequency, f 6 10 Hz, since the\nlight travel time through 10RSch is only 10\u22123 s.\nThe results are presented in Fig. 2. Panel (a) shows the energy\nspectra folded with the period of the QPO, Tqpo = 2pi\/fqpo, and\ndivided by the time average spectrum. No clear spectral evolution\nduring the QPO is seen. This is obviously a consequence of eq. 7,\nsince the spectral slope depends only on the ratio lh\/ls, which is\nunaffected by the QPO. Panel (b) shows the frequency-integrated\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n4 P. T. \u02d9Zycki and M. Sobolewska\nFigure 2.

This is com-\nputed as explained in Sec. 3.1. The QPO rms(E) is basically inde-\npendent of energy, again as a consequence of the lack of spectral\nvariability. The noise rms(E) increases somewhat with energy, be-\ncause of the spectral evolution (hardening) during each flare. Panel\n(c) shows energy spectra in E FE representation: time averaged\nspectrum, r.m.s. spectrum of the variable component and the QPO\nr.m.s. spectrum. The two latter spectra are simply the rms(E) de-\npendencies from previous panel multiplied by time averaged count\nrate FE . Panel (d) show the f -spectra computed in the following\nranges of f : 0.04\u20130.06 Hz, 0.4\u20130.7 Hz, 0.9\u20131.3 Hz (QPO), 1.7\u2013\n2.5 Hz, 4.1-6.1 Hz and 11\u201316 Hz. There is a weak overall trend\nfor hardening of the spectra with f and the QPO f -spectrum (i.e.\nthe spectrum at f around fqpo) is not much different than for other\nvalues of frequency1. Panel (e) shows the equivalent width (EW)\nof the Fe K\u03b1 line as a function of Fourier frequency, comparing it\nto the basic case of no QPO. Again, in the considered case there\nis no additional signal at fqpo. Panels (f) and (g) show results of\ncross-correlation analysis of light curves at 3 keV and 9 keV. By\nconstruction, the model produces hard X\u2013ray time lags. The time\nlags show what seems to be the only signature of QPO in the con-\nsidered case, namely the lags show a clear minimum at fqpo. The\ncoherence function is equal to 1 in almost entire range of f , in par-\nticular there is no signature of QPO here. Finally, (h) shows the\nPDS from light curve at 9 keV.\n3.2.2 Cooling rate not responding to QPO\nIn this case we assume that the soft flux comes from reprocessing\nof the non-periodic flare of hard X\u2013rays only,\nls(t) = NC(t)\u00d7 lh,0(t). (8)\nIt is not entirely clear how this situation may be real-\nized geometrically, since it would probably require a specifically\nanisotropic emission. It is nevertheless an interesting one to exam-\nine because of clear observational signatures. Results, plotted in\nFig. 3 show an obvious pattern of spectral variability during the\nQPO: the brighter the spectra the harder they are2. A consequence\nof this is that the QPO rms increases with energy, and the QPO en-\nergy spectrum is much harder than the other f -spectra. The harder\nQPO spectrum produces somewhat larger EW of the K\u03b1 line at\nfqpo. Similarly to the previous case, the 9 keV vs. 3 keV timelags\nshow some sign changing around fqpo, and the coherence function\nremains equal to 1 at all f .\n3.3 Modulation of the soft flux\nHere we assume that the flux of soft photons is additionally modu-\nlated in quasi-periodic manner. Again, we consider two situations:\nmodulation of the flux with constant temperature of soft seed pho-\ntons, and modulation of the flux with corresponding change of the\nsoft photons temperature.\n1 The QPO f -spectrum is constructed from total P (f) around fqpo, i.e.,\ncontaining contribution both from the broad band noise and the QPO, while\nthe previously considered QPO r.m.s. spectrum was constructed from the\ncomponent describing the QPO only\n2 Note that our model produces a broad band PDS with a QPO, which\nmeans that individual spectra may not obey the trends; the trends are visible\nas the shapes of envelopes of QPO period-folded spectra.\n3.3.1 Constant soft photons temperature\nWe assume that the temperature of the soft seed photons is con-\nstant in time, while their flux is additionally modulated. Specifi-\ncally, lh(t) = lh,0(t) (eq. 1) and\nls(t\u2212 t0) = NC(t\u2212 t0)lh(t) +Aqpo[sin(2pifqpot+ \u03c6qpo)]\n2, (9)\nwhere the square of the sine function assures that ls > 0. Such\nform of ls could correspond to accretion disc pulsations modulating\nthe intrinsic (rather than reprocessed) flux of soft photons. We now\nassume fqpo = 0.5 Hz, so that the QPO is still at 1 Hz in PDS.\nSpectral variability driven by the soft flux produce a charac-\nteristic pivoting behaviour, with the pivot energy intermediate be-\ntween T0 and kTe. This is evident in our simulations presented in\nFig. 4, where the pivot energy is about 20 keV. As a consequence,\nthe rms(E) has a broad minimum around 20 keV. The QPO spec-\ntrum is in consequence much softer than the other f -spectra, at least\nup to\u2248 10 keV. This in turn explains the small EW of K\u03b1 line at the\nQPO frequency. Time lags between 3 keV and 9 keV light curves\ndo not show any clear feature at fqpo, but a sharp drop of the coher-\nence function at fqpo is observed. This is caused by the existence of\ntwo independent Fourier components at fqpo: one from the broad\nband noise, the other from the QPO. The lack of QPO in PDS from\nthe 9 keV light curve is consistent with the presence of minimum\nin rms(E).\n3.3.2 Modulation of the seed photons temperature\nWe assume that the temperature of the soft photons, Tsoft, is mod-\nulated as\nTsoft(t) = T0[1 +Aqpo sin(2pifqpot+ \u03c6qpo)], (10)\nand the corresponding modulation of the soft flux is given by\nls(t) = NC(t)lh(t) +N\n(\nTsoft\nT0\n)4\n, (11)\nwhere we assume Aqpo = 0.1 and fqpo = 1 Hz. The above form\ndescribes two sources of soft photons: in addition to the reprocessed\nphotons, there is an additional flux from periodically modulated\nintrinsic dissipation. We assume that the geometrical dependence\nof the modulated flux is different than that of the reprocessed flux\nand that the covering factor C(t) does not appear in the second\nterm in the expression for cooling compactness.\nThe results (Fig 5) are rather different than those for previ-\nous case of constant Tsoft. Strongest variability is now at low ener-\ngies, around E = kTsoft, and its amplitude decreases with energy.\nConsequently, the QPO spectra are soft and the Fe K\u03b1 line EW is\nlower than our reference case. It does not show any clear feature at\nfqpo. Time lags do show some sign changes around fqpo, while the\ncoherence shows a complex behaviour, with local minima around\nfqpo, but a maximum equal to 1 at fqpo. There is also a harmonic\nQPO at 2fqpo, which is related to the fact that the flux modulation\nis not a simple sinusoidal modulation. The harmonic is strong only\nat the energies where the soft flux appears.\n3.4 Modulation of the covering factor of the reprocessor\nHere we assume that the covering factor of cold matter is addition-\nally quasi-periodically modulated,\nC(t) = C0(t)[1 + Aqpo sin(2pifqpot+ \u03c6qpo)], (12)\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n6 P. T. \u02d9Zycki and M. Sobolewska\nFigure 4. Results for the case of quasi-periodic modulation of the soft cooling flux (see Sec. 3.3.1) with constant temperature of the seed photons. See caption\nto Fig. 2 for detailed description of panels and curves. Characteristic pivoting behaviour resulting from modulations of ls gives broad minimum in rms(E) at\n\u223c 10 keV and, consequently, softer QPO spectra and a minimum in K\u03b1 line EW(f) at f = fqpo.\nwith Aqpo = 0.5, fqpo = 1 Hz, and \u03c6qpo generated as described\nearlier. Both the heating rate and cooling rate are described by\ntheir basic equations, eq. 1 and eq. 2, respectively. Compared to\nthe previous case of modulation of ls, now the amplitude of the\nreprocessed component (Compton reflected continuum with con-\nsistent Fe K\u03b1 line) varies as well, \u2126\/2pi(t) = C(t). This scenario\nmay correspond to disc warping due to, e.g., Lens\u2013Thirring pre-\ncession (e.g., Miller & Homan 2005). Results of computations are\npresented in Fig. 6. The QPO-folded energy spectra show clear piv-\noting around 30\u201350 keV. The variability of the K\u03b1 line with the\nQPO phase is noticeable even in those folded spectra. The QPO\nrms(E) dependence shows an increase of variability rms at the line\nenergy, and a broad minimum around 20\u201350 keV. The QPO spec-\ntrum is then softer than the other f -spectra, while the EW of the\nK\u03b1 line has a sharp maximum at fqpo. This is a clear difference\nwith the previous case of ls modulation, where a soft QPO spec-\ntrum was accompanied by a weak line. Here, the correlation be-\ntween the spectral slope and amplitude of reflection is obeyed in\nthe f -spectra, because of eq. 2. Thus a soft continuum is accompa-\nnied by a strong reflection component, hence strong K\u03b1 line. The 3\nvs. 9 keV time lags appear to reverse sign at fqpo (but are positive\non both sides of it), but there is only very weak loss of coherence\nbetween the two light curves at fqpo.\n3.5 Modulation of absorption column\nOne might imagine that modulation of the observed flux could be\nproduced simply as a result of obscuration by an absorber. Here\nthe results fall into either of two extreme categories. If the variable\nobscuration affects the source spectrum, the results are very com-\nplex. For example, the power spectra contain a number of strong\nharmonics at 2\u00d7, 3\u00d7, . . . of the fundamental frequency. Also the\ncoherence function then shows a number of minima at the same\nf \u2019s. This is obviously because the way the spectra are distorted by\nabsorption is not linear in NH, thus the complexity appears even if\nNH is modulated periodically. On the other hand, if the absorber\nis very optically thick \u03c4T \u226b 5, so that practically no photons are\ntransmitted and the only variable factor is the covering factor, then\nonly the luminosity is modulated, but no spectral signatures are ob-\nserved.\n4 DISCUSSION\nWe have constructed models of X\u2013ray QPO in accreting compact\nsystems, and computed specific energy-spectral properties of the\nQPO in each model. We have assumed general radial propagation\nmodel, where the X\u2013ray emission is produced by structures moving\nradially towards the central black hole (Kotov et al. 2001; Z03). As-\nsuming that the relevant radiative process is thermal Comptoniza-\ntion, we considered cases when the quasi-periodically modulated\nfactor is plasma heating rate, cooling rate by soft photons, ampli-\ntude of the reprocessed component (feedback factor between the\nheating rate and cooling rate), or the temperature of soft photons.\nFor each case we have constructed a set of observable quantities,\nwhich may be compared to good quality data. These are generally\nof two types: energy dependencies at various Fourier frequencies,\nand Fourier frequency dependencies, showing possible signatures\nat fqpo. QPO amplitude as a function of E is the obvious charac-\nteristic, but it is really a powerful tool for constraining models only\nwhen used in conjunction with similar dependencies at other f .\nSuch Fourier spectra show distinct signatures at fqpo in most con-\nsidered models. The QPO spectrum is harder than other f -spectra\nwhen lh is modulated and ls does not respond fully to that modula-\ntion. The QPO spectrum is softer than other f -spectra if the mod-\nulated factor is ls or the reflection amplitude, \u2126\/2pi (assuming the\nlatter controls the feedback between lh and ls). The difference be-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nX\u2013ray quasi-periodic oscillations 7\nFigure 5. Results for the case of quasi-periodic modulation of the soft cooling flux, with corresponding change of seed photons temperature (Sec. 3.3.2),\nare quite different than those with constant Tsoft (Fig. 4). Maximum variability is now at low energies, and the QPO spectrum is very soft. Importantly, this\nmodulation produces also a harmonic of the QPO, although only at low energies (it is no longer visible at 9 keV). Crosses in panel (c) (blue online) show\nthe spectrum of the QPO harmonic. Coherence function (g) shows very complex behaviour: it seems to have a maxima at fqpo and 2fqpo, with values much\nlower than 1 around these two frequencies.\ntween modulation of ls and \u2126\/2pi is in the behaviour of Fe K\u03b1\nline as a function of f : for ls modulation it shows local minimum\nat fqpo, while it shows local maximum at fqpo for \u2126\/2pi modula-\ntion. The coherence function also differs between the case of ls and\n\u2126\/2pi modulation: it shows a dip at fqpo (weaker coherence) in the\nformer case only.\nThe significance of the presented models is in offering possi-\nbilities of providing hints as to the physical models of QPO. The\nbasic question is whether the modulation occurs as a result of in-\nstabilities in the hot plasma or in the cold disc. The former would\nproduce modulation of the heating rate, while the latter modulation\nof the cooling rate, soft photons temperature, reflection amplitude,\nor some combination of these. Candidates for the cold disc instabil-\nities have been discussed in literature for some time now (review in\nKato, Fukue & Mineshige 1998), but no work was done on conse-\nquences of these on X\u2013ray spectra. This is of course not surprising\nbecause physical models of transitions between and interactions of\nthe cold disc and hot corona are at a very early stages of devel-\nopment (Ro\u00b4z\u02d9an\u00b4ska & Czerny 2000, Giannios & Spruit 2004 and\nreferences therein).\nModels presented in this paper certainly do not cover all pos-\nsibilities. One can imagine other, more complex scenarios. In par-\nticular, we have assumed here purely thermal Comptonization,\nwhile most spectra of sources in bright soft states require hybrid\nthermal\/non-thermal plasmas (Gierlin\u00b4ski & Done 2003 and refer-\nences therein). Fits to such spectra usually imply that both direct\nheating and injection of energetic non-thermal particles contribute\nto the energy input. One can then imagine that a modulation might\naffect one of those channels, or their relative importance. We dis-\ncuss some of such models in Sobolewska & \u02d9Zycki (2005) as a\npossible description of low frequency QPO in XTE J1550-564 in\nanomalous very high state.\nGenerally, observational data on QPO energy dependencies\nfrom a number of black hole binaries point to a complex picture\n(Sobolewska & \u02d9Zycki 2005), although certain correlations do ap-\npear. The QPO r.m.s. spectra of sources in hard states seem to be\nsofter than the time averaged spectra, while the QPO spectra of\nsources in soft state appear to be harder than time averaged spectra.\nAccording to our analysis, this would point to driving the modu-\nlation by plasma heating in soft state, while in the hard state the\ndriver would be related to changes in the cold disc. This would cor-\nrespond to the modes of long-term variability discussed for Cyg\nX-1 (Zdziarski et al. 2002), perhaps suggesting that the low fre-\nquency QPO (which appear preferentially during state transitions;\nRutledge et al. 1999), are simply faster and more coherent version\nof the general variability pattern operating in a given spectral state.\nWe discuss this in more detail in Sobolewska \u02d9Zycki (2005).\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nSignatures of quasi-periodic modulation of physical parameters in\nspectral and timing observables are complex, depending on details\nof a particular model. The QPO r.m.s. spectra can be harder than\ntime average spectra if the the plasma heating rate is modulated.\nThe QPO r.m.s. spectra can be softer than the time average spec-\ntrum if parameters of the cool disc are modulated: flux of cooling\nsoft photons or covering factor of the cold plasma.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n8 P.
