They reflect the extensive  \nexploration and exploitation of coal and other materials from the late 18th to the mid- \n20th century that provided a considerable amount of information on the Carboniferous  \ngeology of the region (Cameron & Stephenson 1985; Trewin & Rollin 2002; Read et  \nal. 2002). \n \nAcquired over a period of about 136 years, the specimens were identified by many  \npalaeontologists and occur on rock samples of various dimensions from both borehole  \nand surface exposures. They were almost exclusively collected for the purposes of  \nbiostratigraphy, which in the Scottish Carboniferous generally requires knowledge of  \ntotal assemblages from beds. However, there are rare instances of collectors known  \nto have been biased towards sampling particular fossil groups, and some taxa may  \nalso be under represented. An example of the latter is the seemingly minor occurrence  \nof bryozoans in the materials studied compared to the significant number of genera  \nand species known in field exposures of the mudstone and limestone facies of the  \nHurlet Limestone. \nAyrshire results April 2010   \n  3 \n \nAlthough lacking the systematic sampling required for a detailed quantitative  \ninvestigation, we have shown (Dean et al. 2010) that these historical collections  \nare amenable to explorative multivariate numerical analysis that yields results that are  \ncapable of meaningful palaeoecological interpretation. These compare very  \nfavourably with the qualitative analyses of Wilson (1967; 1989), which arose from  \nover forty years of experience on the Carboniferous of the Midland Valley. Moreover,  \nthey provide the platform for a deeper level of palaeoecological analysis. Here we  \nexploit the BGS database on the macrofaunas collected from the various lithological  \nstrata comprising the Hurlet and Index limestone beds (hereafter referred to as the  \nHurlet and Index limestones) to characterise the trophic structures of associations of  \ntaxa, their links to lithofacies and their spatial distributions. The interpretation of the  \nlast of these is enhanced by draping the results over a three-dimensional computer  \nmodel of part of the Ayrshire Coalfield Basin constructed as part of geological  \nresurvey by the BGS. \n \nGeology and lithostratigraphy \nCarboniferous strata in the area of study form the southern margin of the Ayrshire  \nCoalfield Basin (Fig. 1) and comprise the Strathclyde, Clackmannan and Coal  \nMeasures groups (Dean et al. 2010, fig. 2). Wilson (1989) considered that during \nthe Tournaisian and Vis\u00e9an this western part of the Midland Valley was a relatively  \nstable, slowly subsiding area receiving little sediment in comparison with eastern \nareas. The base of the late Vis\u00e9an Hurlet Limestone marks the bounding surface \nbetween the mainly non-marine sandstones, siltstones, mudstones with volcanic rocks \nof the Strathclyde Group stratigraphically below it and the overlying cyclical  \nAyrshire results April 2010   \n  4 \nsequence of marine limestone-bearing strata of the Lower Limestone Formation,  \nClackmannan Group (Fig. 1). The Hurlet Limestone comprises the lowermost  \nfully marine limestone unit in the Lower Carboniferous succession that can be  \nidentified and correlated across the Midland Valley (Browne et al. 1999). Within the  \narea of study it is generally about 3 m thick (although it can be more than 7 m thick),  \nlight to dark grey and developed largely as compact, well-bedded limestone or  \ncalcareous mudstone with thin limestone interbeds. Mudstone and siltstone strata also  \noccur. The Hurlet Limestone may contain very few fossils other than crinoid  \ncolumnals, but in places it can be highly fossiliferous (see Simpson & MacGregor  \n1932; Eyles et al. 1949; Robertson et al. 1949; Dean 2002). \n \nThe Lower Limestone, Limestone Coal and Upper Limestone formations are  \ncharacterised by strongly cyclical, upward-coarsening sequences of limestone,  \nmudstone, siltstone and sandstone capped by seatearth and coal, with the proportions  \ndiffering in each of the formations. The limestone units within the Lower and Upper  \nLimestone formations represent major marine transgressions and have faunas  \ndominated by brachiopods and molluscs, with other forms such as corals only  \noccurring in significant numbers at a few horizons. The vertical ranges of some  \nspecies have proved useful for stratigraphical correlation both locally and regionally  \n(see Wilson 1967; 1989). \n \nThe base of the early Serpukhovian Index Limestone (Fig. 1) defines the boundary  \nbetween the repeated sequences of coal-bearing strata of the Limestone Coal  \nFormation stratigraphically below it and the overlying cycles of marine limestone- \nbearing strata of the Upper Limestone Formation. It served as an indicator to 19th  \nAyrshire results April 2010   \n  5 \nCentury miners searching for the valuable coals and ironstones of the Limestone Coal  \nFormation and is easily recognised over much of the Midland Valley, although  \ncalcareous strata are not well developed in eastern parts (see Wilson 1967). Up to 3 m  \nthick in the west, the Index Limestone in the area of study is lithologically more  \nvaried than the Hurlet Limestone and has a rich and diverse fauna. The unit comprises  \nbioclastic limestone (including dolostone), argillaceous limestone, calcareous  \nmudstone, mudstone, siltstone and minor sandstone strata  (see Simpson &  \nMacGregor 1932; Eyles et al. 1949; Robertson et al. 1949; Dean 2002). It is generally  \nrather argillaceous at the top and bottom, and the limestone stratum is overlain by a  \nthick marine mudstone \u2018roof\u2019 (Cameron & Stephenson 1985; Read et al. 2002). \n \nShelf palaeoenvironment and biofacies \nWilson (1967) considered the lithological differences in the marine Namurian \nsedimentary rocks of the Midland Valley to reflect different environmental \nconditions, and that these conditions were sufficiently dissimilar for local differences  \nin the benthonic faunas to be developed. Whilst noting that many taxa occur in a wide  \nrange of rock types, he subsequently related the restricted areal distribution of certain  \ngroups of species (biofacies) in Tournaisian and Vis\u00e9an strata to lateral variations in  \nthe lithologies of the individual marine cycles and he presented, in generalised  \ndiagrammatic form, the occurrence of the most commonly found marine fossils in  \nrelation to the lithology of the host rocks (Wilson 1989, fig. 9). Wilson (1989)  \ninterpreted mudstones as representing a near-shore zone, and calcareous mudstones as  \nreflecting a zone intermediate to clearer off-shore or on-shore settings in which  \nlimestones were deposited. He argued that the mudstone provided softer substrates  \ndominated by infaunal organisms and the limestone gave firmer substrates with  \nAyrshire results April 2010   \n  6 \ndominantly epifaunal forms. \n \nWilson (1989) also noted a general correspondence at some horizons (the Hurlet,  \nBlackhall and Hosie limestones) between faunas dominated by epifaunal forms such  \nas calcareous brachiopods, bryozoans and corals in strata of high carbonate content,  \nand those areas with thinner successions and presumably least subsidence. This  \napplied, in particular, to the southern and western parts of the Midland Valley, which  \nwere farthest from the inferred sources of the siliciclastic sediments believed to be  \ntransported by rivers flowing into the region from the N and NE. He did, however,  \nrecognise that the distribution of different types of benthonic faunas must have been  \nthe result of many interacting factors, and that more information and research may  \nwell lead to different interpretations. \n \nFaunas of the Hurlet and Index limestones \nIn many parts of the Midland Valley, the base of the Hurlet Limestone is  \ndistinguished by a transgressive faunal sequence, the so-called Macnair Fauna  \n(Macnair 1917; Wilson 1989, p. 104). However, in the present study area none of the \nelements of the Macnair Fauna have been positively identified in the mudstone strata \nforming the base of the Hurlet Limestone or in the limestone stratum itself, although  \nthe presence of the brachiopods Echinoconchus sp. and ?Pugilis sp., and the bivalve  \nSanguinolites sp. in the said limestone may be biostratigraphically significant (see  \nWilson, 1989; Dean 2002). \n \nThree biofacies were distinguished by Wilson (1989 and references therein) in the  \nlimestone and mudstone strata of the Hurlet Limestone. Biofacies 1, with dominant  \nAyrshire results April 2010   \n  7 \nLingula, Productus and Euphemites indicated shallow, possibly locally brackish  \nwaters with a relatively high siliciclastic input. Biofacies 2, with dominant Avonia,  \nPleuropugnoides and Limipecten was regarded as indicating generally shallow shelf  \nseas, with intermediate conditions between Biofacies 1 and 3. Biofacies 3, with  \ndominant solitary corals (excluding zaphrentoids), Krotovia and Conocardium,  \nindicated quiet, well-lit waters in near-shore to off-shore areas - Conocardium being  \ncharacteristic of \u2018biohermal\u2019 build ups. Siliciclastic content decreases and carbonate  \ncontent increases from the areas of biofacies 1 to 3 suggesting the main source of  \nclastic inflow lay to the NW, probably from the mouth of a river system there (see  \nWilson 1989, fig. 8). Dean et al. (2010) identified three faunal groups in the  \nHurlet Limestone with a broad link to lithofacies that accord with the interpretations  \nof Wilson (1989). If Biofacies 3 of Wilson (1989) equates with Group 2 of Dean et al.  \n(2010) then the former may be extended (to a small degree) into an area of the  \nMidland Valley for which no palaeoenvironmental information was previously given  \n(see Wilson 1989, fig. 8). \n \nThe Index Limestone has a distinctive fossil content over much of the Midland  \nValley, with algal concretions and the brachiopod Latiproductus latissimus common  \nin many places. In the mudstone immediately above and below the limestone stratum   \na rich and varied fauna is normally present with brachiopods and molluscs (Wilson  \n1967). \n \nWhilst Wilson (1967) did not define biofacies as such in the limestone and mudstone  \nstrata of the Index Limestone, he did refer to epifaunal variation in the overlying  \nUpper Limestone Formation as the formally named limestone beds are traced laterally  \nAyrshire results April 2010   \n  8 \nfrom approximately SE to NW possibly reflecting river influx into the shelf area from  \nthe north. He considered that this would, in general, reduce the salinity of the marine  \nwater and increase the siliciclastic sediment content, which in turn would influence  \nthe benthonic faunas.  \n \nNumerical analyses \nThe BGS macrofossil collections from the Hurlet and Index limestones \nThe faunas from surface exposures and boreholes in Ayrshire are mainly held in the  \nBiostratigraphy collections in the British Geological Survey office in Edinburgh (see  \nDean 2002) and were collected over a period of nearly 140 years. They comprise 20  \nsamples from 14 localities from the Hurlet Limestone and 94 samples from 53  \nlocalities from the Index Limestone (see Dean et al. 2010, fig. 1). The taxonomic  \nidentification of each recorded fossil is at the highest possible level of determination,  \nwhich ranges from named species to phylum. The macrofaunal data from each  \nlocality can be further subdivided by sample lithology into faunas from  \nmudstone\/claystone (undifferentiated), calcareous mudstone, sandstone, siltstone,  \ncalcareous siltstone, limestone, argillaceous limestone and dolostone. As noted by  \nDean et al. (2010) the data have their limitations compared to those from a  \ndedicated palaeoecological sampling exercise: \n \n1. Sample sizes are highly variable and samples from the same locality are not  \nnecessarily from the same stratum, even though they may be in the same \nlithology. Stratal variations in species and genera are a marked feature of both  \nlimestones and are pronounced even within the same lithologies (Dr C. J.   \nBurton, pers. comm. April 2010). \nAyrshire results April 2010   \n  9 \n \n2. Taxonomic identifications in the database are made by many palaeontologists  \nand most of the material has not formed part of a systematic taxonomic or \necophenotypic study. \n \n3. The collections lack any taphonomic assessment. \n \n4. Only presence\/absence data are available, which severely limits the range of  \nnumerical methods that can be applied. \n \nNumerical techniques \nTo try to overcome some of the problems inherent in the historical collections Dean et  \nal. (2010) undertook successive analytical iterations on increasingly restricted  \nversions of the original data sets. This restriction was done by: removing records of  \nindeterminate taxa where named members of their larger groups were recorded from  \nthe same sample; assigning material recorded as having any level of affinity to a  \nnamed species to that species if it was unequivocally identified at any locality in the  \nspecies level data set; and finally, excluding any taxa that were unique to a single  \nsample. For the lithologically fairly homogenous Hurlet Limestone, seriation, non- \nmetric multidimensional scaling and to a more limited extent cluster analysis of the  \npresence\/absence data in samples that were not differentiated by lithology indicated  \nthree groups of faunas that corresponded well with the outcomes of the semi- \nquantitative analysis of Wilson (1989) noted above. This gave confidence that the  \ndata are sufficient to provide at least a broad indication of palaeoecology. \n \nAyrshire results April 2010   \n  10 \nSamples from the commonly thicker, more lithologically varied Index Limestone  \nrevealed no consistent patters of associations of taxa when different lithologies from  \nthe same locality were grouped. The inclusion of lithological data for the Index  \nLimestone and constraining the genus level seriation by the ordering determined for  \nthe limestone samples alone resulted in the broad grouping of lithologies suggesting,  \nas with the Hurlet Limestone, that the faunas were distributed along environmental  \ngradients within the carbonate facies that extended into other sedimentary settings in a  \nsystematic way. Echinoids, fenestellid bryozoans, the gastropod Naticopsis and the  \nbrachiopods Rhipidomella and ?Pugnax, were restricted to the limestone  \nenvironment, whilst many of the other taxa range through increasingly coarse-grained  \nsiliciclastic settings towards the zone of river sediment influx (see Dean et al. 2010,  \nfigs 16\u201317). \n \nIn addition to the analysis of presence\/absence data, a measure of diversity (i.e. genus  \nrichness) was provided by analysing the number of genera present within higher  \ntaxonomic groups in each sample. These data were amenable to analysis using cluster  \nanalysis and Principal Components Analysis (PCA), the latter providing an ordination  \nof samples (Dean et al. 2010, figs 6 and 12) that broadly reflects the grouping of  \nsamples evident in the cluster analyses. These clusters from the data set in which the  \nsample lithologies are identified provide the basis of the explicitly broad-brush  \nanalysis of faunas herein.  \n \nPatterns in the Hurlet Limestone data \nCluster analysis of the numbers of genera within higher taxa using the statistical  \npackage PAST (Hammer et al. 2001) provided three major clusters (Ht 1\u2013Ht 3), five  \nAyrshire results April 2010   \n  11 \nsub-clusters, and five close pairings (Dean et al. 2010, fig. 11). The major  \nclusters (summarised on Table 1) also define distinct fields defined by the first three  \nprincipal components of a PCA (Dean et al. 2010, fig. 12). \n \nHt 1 comprises seven samples in a wide range of lithologies, all of which contain  \nbrachipods of variable diversity. A genus of bivalve is present in all but one sample  \nand crinoid columnals are present in five of the samples, nautiloids in two. \n \nHt 2 comprises seven samples in a wide range of lithologies. Six of these samples  \ncontain only brachiopod genera; the seventh also contains a gastropod genus. \n \nHt 3 comprises five samples, all containing crinoid columnals and all but one of  \nwhich contains brachiopods with a great range of genus diversities. Two of the  \nsamples are the only ones in the Hurlet Limestone to contain bryozoans. All but one  \nsample is from limestone; the exception, an undifferentiated mudstone\/claystone, is  \nthe only one in the cluster to contain just crinoid columnals. \n \nPatterns in the Index Limestone data \nFor the diversity data of genera within higher taxa, cluster analysis of samples from  \nthe Index Limestone divided by lithology showed two major clusters (Ix 1\u2013Ix 2) and  \neight sub-clusters (Ix 1.1\u2013Ix 1.2 and Ix 2.1\u2013Ix 2.6) (Dean et al. 2010, fig. 13;  \nTables 1 and 2 herein). The major clusters and, with some overlap, the sub-clusters  \nwithin them are also differentiated by the first three components of the PCA plots  \n(Dean et al. 2010, fig. 14). \n \nAyrshire results April 2010   \n  12 \nThe 38 sub-clustered samples in major cluster Ix 1 comprise a wide range of \nlithologies and are dominated by brachiopods, with most samples in sub-cluster Ix 1.2 \nbeing restricted to members of this phylum. The 27 sub-clustered samples in major \ncluster Ix 2 also comprise a wide range of lithologies and are also dominated by \nbrachiopods, but bivalves are ubiquitous too and may be highly diverse. Gastropod \ngenera occur in all samples in Ix 2.2\u2013Ix 2.4. Bryozoans are restricted to Ix 2.1. \nCrinoid columnals occur in all the samples of Ix 2.5 and in all but one sample each of \nIx 2.2 and Ix 2.4. The taxonomic compositions and lithologies represented in the sub-\nclusters are summarised on Table 1. \n \nTrophic structure \nThe groupings of samples arising from the cluster analyses of the \u2018diversity\u2019 of   \ngenera within higher taxa provides a broad picture of the associations of taxa that  \navoids the \u2018over-interpetation\u2019 that might result from faunal associations identified at  \ngenus and species level. These \u2018diversity\u2019 groupings can be assessed in terms of the  \ngross patterns of how organisms exploited their environment by looking at aspects of  \ntheir trophic structure (see Scott 1978; Etter 1999 for general discussion of the  \nprinciples involved). Clearly the resultant patterns are those of the preserved shelly  \nbenthos and do not take account of those groups filtered out through taphonomic  \nprocesses, especially soft bodied taxa. The interpretations of feeding behaviours of  \nthe taxa present in the Hurlet and Index limestones are those of Wilson (1989). \n \nFigure 2 summarises the distribution of the clusters of \u2018diversity\u2019 samples in  \nthe Hurlet and Index limestones, respectively, in terms of the relative proportions of  \nsuspension feeders (SUSP), detritus feeders (DET), and predators and carnivores  \nAyrshire results April 2010   \n  13 \n(PRED). In the case of the Hurlet Limestone (Fig. 2a), the relatively small number of  \nindividual samples means that these can be plotted directly on the ternary diagram,  \nbut in order to simplify the diagram for the greater number of samples in the  \nIndex Limestone data set (Fig. 2b), a \u2018mean value\u2019 is plotted as a generalised proxy  \nfor the sub-clusters, based on the total numbers of all genera recorded within each  \nphylum in each sub-cluster. Figure 3 presents substrate-niche ternary diagrams for the  \ntwo units illustrating the proportions of vagrant detritus feeders (VAGDET), epifaunal  \nsuspension feeders (EPSUS), and infaunal suspension feeders (INSUS). Again, the  \n\u2018mean values\u2019 of the sub-clusters are plotted for the Index Limestone (Fig. 3b).  \n \nFor the Hurlet Limestone, the feeding habits and substrate niche\/trophic structures for  \nthe three major clusters show Ht 2 and Ht 3 dominated by epifaunal suspension  \nfeeders, but Ht 1 plots in the \u2018detritus-suspension\u2019 and \u2018epifaunal\u2019 fields of the  \ndiagrams. This cluster is the only one to contain bivalves. \n \nFor the Index Limestone, the feeding habits and substrate niche\/trophic structures for  \nthe eight sub-clusters indicate that most comprise epifaunal suspension feeders.  \nHowever, Ix 2.2 plots in the \u2018detritus-suspension\u2019 and \u2018vagrant-epifaunal\u2019 fields of the  \ndiagrams. This cluster has the largest range of higher taxa, and the highest percentage  \nof molluscan genera to all others. It is the only cluster noted as containing scaphopods  \nand ostracods. \n \nBambach et al. (2007; see also Bush et al. 2007) developed a graphical means of  \ndisplaying the amount of ecospace occupied by marine organisms based on their  \npresence or absence in six categories within each of three major aspects of \nAyrshire results April 2010   \n  14 \nautecology: tiering position in relation to the substratum\/water interface; motility  \nlevel; and feeding strategy. Table 2 shows the resulting patterns in each faunal  \ncluster\/sub-cluster in the Hurlet and Index limestones based on an interpretation of the  \nautecology of the named genera in each cluster.   \n \nFor the Hurlet Limestone, application of the categorisation by Bambach et al. (2007)  \nstrongly enhances the results shown by the ternary diagrams (Figs 2a and 3a). Whilst  \nthe diagrams indicate that all three major clusters (Ht 1\u2013Ht 3) comprise mainly \nepifaunal suspension feeders, Table 2 shows that they all include marine organisms of  \nthe surficial and semi-infaunal tiers, non-motile (attached and unattached) forms, and  \nsuspension feeders. Table 2 also illustrates a trend of increasing ecological complexity  \nfrom Ht 3 through Ht 2 to Ht 1, with the last mentioned including representatives  \nfrom the pelagic and shallow infaunal tiers, freely fast and facultative (both attached  \nand unattached) motile forms, and mining and predatory feeders. This is explained by  \nbivalves and nautiloids exclusively occurring in Ht 1 (Table 1).  \n \nFor the Index Limestone, application of the ecological categorisation by Bambach et  \nal. (2007) again strongly enhances the results shown by the ternary diagrams (Figs 2b  \nand 3b). Table 2 shows that sub-clusters Ix 1.1 and Ix 1.2 have in common  \nrepresentatives of the surficial and semi-infaunal tiers, non-motile (attached and  \nunattached) forms, and suspension feeders. Ix 1.2, however, comprising 33 samples,  \nis much more ecologically complex with representatives of the pelagic tier, freely fast  \nmotile forms and predators. Bivalves, nautiloids, anthozoans and trace fossils are  \nexclusive to Ix 1.2 (Table 1) of major cluster Ix 1. \n \nAyrshire results April 2010   \n  15 \nTable 2 shows sub-clusters Ix 2.1\u2013Ix 2.6 have in common representatives of the  \nsurficial and semi-infaunal tiers, non-motile (attached and unattached) forms, and  \nsuspension feeders and miners. All but Ix 2.5 also include the shallow infaunal tier  \nand slow, freely motile organisms. A trend in increasing ecological complexity  \n(similar to that shown in Figs 2b and 3b) is also recognised with Ix 2.5 being faunally  \nthe most simple and Ix 2.4 and Ix 2.2 the most varied. Table 2 shows that Ix 2.4 and  \nIx 2.2 also include the pelagic tier, fast, freely motile forms and predators. Within  \nmajor cluster Ix 2, nautiloids are exclusive to both sub-clusters, anthozoans to Ix 2.4,  \nand scaphopods and crustaceans to Ix 2.2 (Table 1).  \n \nWilson (1967, 1989) stated that the seas which invaded central Scotland in Vis\u00e9an and  \nNamurian times were never deep and trophic analysis shows that the fundamental  \nbiofacies of the Hurlet and Index limestones comprise mainly non-motile (attached or  \nunattached), suspension feeding brachiopods of the surficial and semi-infaunal tiers.  \nThat the region was subject to relatively rapid fluctuations in depth, variations in sea  \nfloor conditions and water quality is shown by the variable and sporadic addition of  \nother forms including bivalves, nautiloids, anthozoans, scaphopods, crustaceans and  \ntrace fossils that include representatives of the pelagic and shallow infaunal tiers,  \nfreely fast and facultative (both attached and unattached) motile forms and mining and  \npredatory feeders.  \n \nThe Mississipian Lower and Upper Limestone formations of central Scotland are of  \nmixed shelf carbonate and deltaic (Yoredale-type) facies, which are common in  \npenecontemporaneous strata in northern Britain. However, in south Cumbria, for  \nexample, the Bowland Shale Formation is of hemi-pelagic facies comprising mainly  \nAyrshire results April 2010   \n  16 \nmudstone, subordinate beds of siltstone, sandstone and limestone and \u2018marine bands\u2019  \n(Dean et al. in press). Trophic analysis by multivariate numerical methods of fossils  \ncollected systematically from these \u2018marine bands\u2019 should help to distinguish the  \nfaunal phases developed in association with the advance, acme and retreat of each  \nmarine incursion. \n \nTwo dimensional geographical distribution of the \u2018diversity\u2019 clusters  \nWhilst the qualitative analysis of Wilson (1989) may infer a relationship between  \nlithofacies and the palaeoenvironment, quantitative analysis by Dean et al. (2010)  \nconfirms this relationship and, most encouragingly, enables subtle patterns not  \nrecognised by qualitative methods, as in the Index Limestone, to be recognised at  \ndeeper levels within it. Figures 4 and 5 respectively plot the geographical distribution  \nof the samples within the main clusters (Ht 1\u2013Ht 3) in the Hurlet Limestone and the  \nsub-clusters (Ix 1.1\u2013Ix 1.2 and Ix 2.1\u2013Ix 2.6) in the Index Limestone identified by  \ncluster analysis of the diversity of genera within higher taxa by Dean et al. (2010) and  \nshown in Table 1. The distribution of sample localities is very largely controlled by  \nthe outcrop of the Hurlet and Index limestones in the district. These concentrate in  \nthree main areas, in the NE around Sorn, in central parts around Patna, and in the SW  \nto the northwest of Dailly. Whilst these lithostratigraphical units may or may not  \nsubcrop at depth beneath younger rocks, the data for this study are mainly confined to  \nthe areas of outcrop, and this limits the scope for palaeoenvironmental interpretation.  \n \nThe palaeoenvironment of the Hurlet Limestone shown in Figure 4 represents a  \ncombination of the faunas and lithologies in the samples comprising major clusters Ht  \n1\u2013Ht 3 as discriminated by cluster analysis in Dean et al. (2010). Interpretation of  \nAyrshire results April 2010   \n  17 \nthe relative proportion of the sample lithologies in the combined clusters at each  \nlocality suggests that the palaeoenvironment in the NE was most diverse where the  \nrange is from clearer water (with firmer substrates and dominantly epifaunal forms)  \nthrough to muddy water (with softer substrates and dominantly infaunal forms) and  \nalso areas of influx of river-borne siliciclastic deposits. In the central and SW areas  \nonly the clearer water environment is inferred.  \n \nSamples from Ht 1 and Ht 2 are represented in all three main areas, but Ht 3 is  \nrestricted to the NE and SW. This cluster is the least ecologically complex in the  \nHurlet Limestone and includes just brachiopods, crinoids and bryozoa in mainly  \nlimestone lithologies (Table 1). Because the stratigraphical sequence of samples in the  \nhistorical collection is unknown it cannot be confirmed that the trend of increasing  \necological complexity from Ht 3 through Ht 2 to Ht 1 (as noted in the section on  \ntrophic analysis) represents a transgressive sequence. A more acceptable explanation  \nof the omission of Ht 3 at Patna is Wilson\u2019s (1987) observation that the Midland  \nValley region was subject to relatively rapid fluctuations in depth, and variations in  \nsea floor conditions and water quality. This may account for the local omission of this  \ncluster in the Patna area, which where sampled did not achieve the shallowness and  \nclarity of water attained at Dailly and Sorn. \n \nThe palaeoenvironment of the Index Limestone as shown in Figure 5 represents a  \ncombination of the faunas and lithologies in the samples comprising the sub-clusters  \nin major clusters Ix 1 and Ix 2 discriminated by the cluster analysis of Dean et al.  \n(2010). Interpretation of the relative proportion of the sample lithologies in the  \ncombined clusters suggests that the palaeoenvironment was much more varied than  \nAyrshire results April 2010   \n  18 \nthat of the Hurlet Limestone. In the Patna area there is a SW to NE zonation from  \nclear water, through the intermediate zone to muddy water. River-borne siliciclastic  \ndeposits are mapped at Sorn extending to the SE, perhaps in a channel, and flanked by  \ngradients of increasing water clarity. Local incursions of river-borne sediment are also  \npresent along the southern margin of the study area inferred to be from the subdued  \nrelief of the Southern Uplands to the south and although the narrow basin at Dailly is  \ndominated by the clear water environment (Ix1 cluster) there is a narrow southward  \ngradient of slightly elevated mud content inferred to be derived from the Southern  \nUplands source. \n \nSamples from sub-clusters Ix 1.2, Ix 2.4 and Ix 2.6 are represented in all three of the  \nmain areas, but Ix 1.1 is only found in the Sorn and Dailly areas, Ix 2.1 in the Patna  \nand Sorn areas, Ix 2.2 in the Patna area, and Ix 2.3 and Ix 2.5 only in the Dailly and  \nPatna areas. Like the Hurlet Limestone the explanation for this distribution is not  \nconsidered marine transgressive, but perhaps due to rapid, possibly local, fluctuations  \nin depth, sea floor conditions and water quality. \n \nThe distributions of environments shown in Figures 4 and 5 should not be considered  \nstatic or time constrained. The depositional facies will have varied spatially and  \nmigrated temporally during the marine transgressions of the Hurlet and Index  \nlimestones. \n \nThe conditions of cyclical (Yoredale-type) sedimentation were probably similar  \nduring deposition of the Lower and the Upper Limestone formations (Wilson 1967;  \nRead et al. 2002). During both intervals a major landmass occurred to the north of the  \nAyrshire results April 2010   \n  19 \ndistrict, whilst to the south an archipelagic landmass of low relief (lying on the site of  \nthe present Southern Uplands) would probably have existed. Between these massifs  \nwas a relatively stable broad shelf area with little deposition (the Ayrshire Basin),  \nwhich was separated from the rest of the Midland Valley further east by the  \nMississippian lava sequence of the Clyde Plateau Volcanic Formation. The latter is  \nconsidered to have been a persistent topographical high (Francis 1991a; 1991b) and  \nprobably acted as a barrier to faunal migration to the Ayrshire shelf. Thus although  \nWilson (1989, fig. 8a; see also Wilson 1967; Read et al. 2002) showed an \u2018influx of  \nclastics\u2019 associated with a large river system flowing off the major landmass to the  \nnorth during the upward-coarsening sedimentary cycle that started with the marine  \ntransgression associated with the Hurlet Limestone, it is unlikely that the siliciclastic  \nrocks shown in the NE area of Figure 4 are a distal representation of this river system.  \nThey probably reflect a more local source as do the siliciclastic sedimentary rocks  \nshown in the NE area during deposition of the Index Limestone (Fig. 5).  \n \nDraping the geographical distributions on modelled three dimensional surfaces \nOf particular interest in the palaeoenvironmental interpretation of the Index  \nLimestone (Fig. 5) is the \u2018embayment\u2019 in the distribution of environments interpreted  \nto the northeast of Patna in the central part of the study area. A link between the  \ninferred depositional environments and faults with known penecontemporaneous  \ndisplacement is clearly demonstrated by draping the environmental patterns  \nsummarised in Figures 4 and 5 over 3D computer models of the Hurlet and Index  \nlimestones in the subsurface, which have been developed as part of the research  \nduring current resurvey by BGS. In particular, Figure 6 shows that the  \npalaeoenvironmental \u2018embayment\u2019 in the Index Limestone of the muddy water  \nAyrshire results April 2010   \n  20 \nenvironment that extends in a southwesterly direction into the clearer water \nenvironment, was linked to the presence of the Kerse Loch Fault. Moreover, the inset \non Figure 6 (from Mykura 1967, fig. 2a) shows the coincidence of the isopach pattern \nin the Limestone Coal Formation and our palaeoenvironmental interpretation of the \nIndex Limestone at the \u2018embayment\u2019. All of this suggests that movement of the Kerse \nLoch Fault influenced the palaeogeography, marine water flow and in turn the \nenvironments of the Index Limestone. Movement on this fault during the \nCarboniferous has long been known to have influenced sedimentation patterns (see \nMykura 1967, pp. 27\u201331, fig. 2; Wilson 1989, pp. 122\u2013123, fig. 12; Read et al. 2002,  \np. 276), and we now show that this in turn influenced the distribution of genus \ndiversity in the benthonic faunas. Eyles et al. (1949) record lateral thickness variation  \nduring deposition of the Clackmannan Group across the Kerse Loch Fault and infer  \ncontemporaneous displacement. They note the thickness variation within  \nMississippian strata was greatest during deposition of the Upper Limestone Formation  \nof which the Index Limestone is at the base. If fault displacement accommodated only  \ndifferential basin subsidence, environmental conditions at the seabed would be  \nunchanged and no response observed in the benthonic faunas. The \u2018embayment\u2019 of  \nmuddy conditions, defined by the subtle results of numerical analysis of faunas in the  \nIndex Limestone, demonstrate there was a \u2018step-like feature in the landscape\u2019 and  \nmore muddy conditions at the foot of a fault scarp at the Kerse Loch Fault rather than  \nthe alternative of a north-westerly shoaling sea floor (Eyles et al. 1949).  \n \n3D models of the subsurface in the NE (Sorn) area suggest possible coeval fault  \ncontrol in the NW-SE trending palaeoenvironments in both the Hurlet and Index  \nlimestones in the vicinity of the Mossbog and Auchmillan faults (see Fig. 6 for the  \nAyrshire results April 2010   \n  21 \nIndex Limestone). The same also applies to the NE-SW trending palaeoenvironmental  \nbelt in the Index Limestone adjacent to the Kerse Loch Fault in the SW (Dailly) area  \n(see also Mykura 1967, figs 2a and 13). \n \nConclusions \nNumerical analysis of historical collections of upper Mississippian fossils from the  \nHurlet and Index limestones of Ayrshire provides a significantly deeper level of  \npalaeoecological and palaeogeographical interpretation than qualitative analysis  \nalone. Subtle patterns in the trophic structure of associated taxa based on the  \noccurrence of genera within larger taxonomic groupings, their links to lithofacies and  \ntheir spatial distributions may be characterised. \n \nFor the Hurlet Limestone, the cluster analysis of the \u2018diversity\u2019 of genera within  \nhigher taxa provides three major groups of samples. Two of these are dominated by  \nepifaunal suspension feeders, whilst the third comprises epifaunal detritus-suspension  \nfeeders. All three major clusters include marine organisms of the surficial and semi- \ninfaunal tiers, non-motile (attached and unattached) forms, and suspension feeders,  \nbut they show a trend of increasing ecological complexity ultimately to include  \nrepresentatives of the pelagic and shallow infaunal tiers, freely fast and facultative  \n(both attached and unattached) motile forms, and mining and predatory feeders. \n \nFor the Index Limestone, cluster analysis provides two major groups of samples and  \neight sub-clusters; five of the sub-clusters comprise epifaunal suspension feeders two  \nepifaunal detritus-suspension feeders, and one vagrant-epifaunal detritus-suspension  \nfeeders. One of the major groups includes representatives of the surficial and semi- \nAyrshire results April 2010   \n  22 \ninfaunal tiers, non-motile (attached and unattached) forms, and suspension feeders.  \nOne sub-cluster is much more ecologically complex with representatives of the  \npelagic tier, freely fast motile forms and predators. The second major group of  \nsamples includes six sub-clusters, which show a strong trend of increasing ecological  \ncomplexity ultimately to include representatives of the pelagic tier, fast, freely motile  \nforms and predators.  \n \nThe fundamental biofacies of the Hurlet and Index limestones comprises mainly non- \nmotile (attached or unattached), suspension feeding brachiopods of the surficial and  \nsemi-infaunal tiers. These occurred in a shallow sea over central Scotland in Vis\u00e9an  \nand Namurian times, but the sporadic inclusion of representatives of the pelagic and  \nshallow infaunal tiers, freely fast and facultative (both attached and unattached)  \nmotile forms and mining and predatory feeders suggests relatively rapid fluctuations  \nin depth, variations in sea floor conditions and water quality. \n \nThe palaeoenvironment of the Hurlet Limestone was most diverse in the NE of the  \nstudy area where it ranged from clearer water (with firmer substrates and dominantly  \nepifaunal forms) through to muddy water (with softer substrates and dominantly  \ninfaunal forms). Areas of river-borne siliciclastic deposits are also evident. In the  \ncentral and SW areas only the clearer water environment is inferred.  The least  \necologically complex faunal cluster was restricted to the NE and SW. Its omission in  \nthe central area is thought due to the sea at that locality not achieving the shallowness  \nand clarity of water attained elsewhere. \n \nThe palaeoenvironment of the Index Limestone was much more varied than that of  \nAyrshire results April 2010   \n  23 \nthe Hurlet Limestone. In the central area there is a SW to NE zonation from clear  \nwater, through the intermediate zone to muddy water. River-borne siliciclastic  \ndeposits are mapped at Sorn extending to the SE, flanked by gradients of increasing  \nwater clarity. Local northward incursions of river-borne sediment from the low relief  \nSouthern Uplands that lay to the south are also present along the southern margin of  \nthe study area.  \n \nThe 2D geographical distribution of the palaeoenvironments deduced from the trophic  \nstructure combined with lithological information demonstrates the influence of  \npenecontemporaneous faulting within the Ayrshire Coalfield Basin. An \u2018embayment\u2019  \nin the distribution of environments in the central part of the study area links inferred  \ndepositional environments in the Index Limestone with the Kerse Loch Fault and is  \nclearly demonstrated by draping the environmental pattern over a 3D computer model  \nof the subsurface. In this \u2018embayment\u2019 the muddy water environment extends in a  \nsouthwesterly direction into the clearer water environment linked to the fault, with  \nknown penecontemporaneous displacement, which influenced the palaeogeography,  \npalaeotopography, marine water flow, environments and distribution of genus  \ndiversity in the benthonic faunas during deposition of the Index Limestone in the  \nthickened sequence at the base of the south-facing fault scarp. \n \n3D models of the subsurface also suggest possible coeval fault control of   \npalaeoenvironments in both the Hurlet and Index limestones in the vicinity of the  \nMossbog and Auchmillan faults in the NE of the study area.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nAyrshire results April 2010   \n  24 \nWe thank Dr Alistair McGowan, Dr Christopher Burton and an anonymous referee  \nfor their very helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper.
