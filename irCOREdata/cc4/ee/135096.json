The \ndata show that this coating method can yield very thin films of thickness of order of 15 - 20% \nat  most  of  the  equivalent  cell  depth  of  a  gravure  roller.  Air  free and non ribbed stable \nuniform films can however only be obtained in a narrow window of operating conditions at \nvery low substrate capillary number (CaS ~ 0.02) equivalent to substrate speeds typically less \nthan 20m\/min. The paper draws a similarity with flow features observed with smooth forward \nroll coating and slide coating. It is shown that the onset of ribbing and the flux distribution \nbetween the gravure roller and the substrate at the exit of the nip obey approximately the \nsame rules as in smooth forward roll coating, whereas the onset of air entrainment actually \ncorresponds to a low-flow limit of coatability similar to that observed in slide coating. \n \n \nKeywords : Coating, Gravure, Print, Flow Instabilities, Film Thickness, Experiments \n \n \n1 - INTRODUCTION \n \nCoating flows are fluid flows which result in thin films of liquid forming onto surfaces and \nare engineered for the manufacture of a variety of products. Typical examples include paper \nand  adhesive  tapes,  photographic  and  X-ray  films,  magnetic  tapes  for  audio,  video  and \ncomputer use, electronic circuit boards, printing plates for papers, books and magazines and \ncoated papers for printing (Cohen and Gutoff, 1992). The terminology associated with coating \nmethods is diverse but they can all be classified according to Benkreira et al. (1994) into one \nor a combination of the following broad ways: \n \n (1)  free coating such as in the unhindered withdrawal of liquid from a pool by a moving \nsubstrate; \n (2)  metered  coating  such  as  when  an  excess  amount  of  liquid  is  metered  in  a  flow \ngeometry to form a film onto a moving substrate (e.g. blade, air knife, forward or \nreverse roll coating); \n (3)  transfer coating where an exact amount of liquid is delivered in a flow geometry to \nform a film onto a moving substrate (kiss, die, slot, slide or curtain coating); \n (4)  print or gravure coating where a film is formed when a moving substrate wipes a \nproportion of a coating trapped in the cells of a printed or gravure roller. \n                                                 \n1 corresponding author: Tel (01274) 383721 Fax (01274) 385700 Email H.Benkreira@bradford.ac.uk   2 \n \nNone of these flows can operate to yield the wide range of film thicknesses (5-500 microns) \nand speeds (0.1- 25 m\/s) required in practice without exhibiting non uniformity (instabilities) \non the free surface in the form of ribs or air bubbles entrained in the film. For each coating \nflow there is a narrow stable window of operation, not always easily predictable. The stability \nwindows observed with reverse roll coating (Coyle et al., 1990a) and slot coating (Sartor, \n1990)  are  typical  examples.  As  we  move  down  these  types  of  flows  to  gravure  coating, \nthinner films (5-15 microns) can be attained (in principle as low as we can engrave the cells) \nbut the onset of instabilities limit the speed of application and the conditions at which these \noccur are not yet known. \n \nWhereas  types  (1),  (2)  and  (3)  flows  have  been  well  researched  theoretically  and \nexperimentally and significant progress has been made in their understanding (for a review, \nsee Kistler and Schweitzer, 1997), research in type (4) flow \u2013 print or gravure coating \u2013 is \nvery limited (Pulkrabek and Munter, 1983 ; Patel and Benkreira, 1991 ; Benkreira and Patel, \n1993) and this may be attributed to the complexity of the geometry of the flow system. Print \nor gravure coating uses a roller with a pattern of cells of regular and precise geometry which \nare either chemically or mechanically engraved on it. These cells form complex patterns (see \nfig. 1) such as the quadrangular, trihelical and pyramidal geometries with cell volume per unit \narea of about 5 to 50 x 10\n-6 m\n3\/m\n2 and a wetted area coverage of 0.80 to 0.90 m\n2\/m\n2 of roller \nsurface. In actual operations, the engraved cells are flooded with the coating liquid and the \nexcess which forms over is wiped by a blade pressed against the rotating roller. The liquid \ntrapped in the cells is then transferred onto the substrate usually in one of three ways as \nillustrated in fig. 2 : direct forward, direct reverse or indirect forward known also as offset \ngravure when the substrate is arranged in \u201ckiss contact\u201d with the impression roller (i.e. not \nsandwiched between the gravure and impression rollers). In the classification adopted above, \nthe offset mode is not a key coating flow per se; it is composed of a gravure coating flow and \na transfer coating flow. Also, flow situations where a surplus film is formed over the cells are \nstrictly not gravure coating flows which are designed, as explained above, specifically with \nthe aim of achieving the thinnest possible films. The blade loading over the gravure roller \nforms thus an important part and this aspect was investigated by Patel and Benkreira (1991) \nwho showed experimentally that higher cell volume factors reduce the surplus film but that \ntrue gravure coating is not easily achieved unless very low viscosity fluids are used. The \npractical difficulty of completely doctoring the surplus, without excessively loading the blade \nhence possibly damaging the cells particularly with standard chromed rollers, can explain the \nuse of an impression rubber roller instead of a doctor blade to remove the surplus liquid at \nentry to the nip. It is also thought that this arrangement controls the thickness of the final film \nformed  and  the  onset  of  ribbing  instabilities  and  air entrainment.  These observations  are \nknown in industrial practice but no underlying studies are available to underpin and quantify \nthese effects.  \n \nThe transfer of the liquid from the cells to the moving substrate in the direct reverse mode of \noperation  was  studied  experimentally  by  Benkreira  and  Patel  (1993)  and  their  findings \nindicate that about 1\/3 of the cell volume is transferred as a film at large speeds regardless of \nspeed ratios (between the moving web and gravure roller). At low speeds, there appears to be \na maximum in the film thickness curves for the trihelical and pyramidal cell configurations \nsuggesting that larger films are formed i.e. the cells which are deeper empty better at low \nspeeds.  The  reverse  was  observed  with  the  quadrangular  geometry  where  the  cells  are \nshallower and a minimum occurs at low speeds.   3 \n \nAt present no comprehensive studies of the other two modes of gravure coating operations \nhave been made. The aim of this investigation is to extend our knowledge of gravure coating \nflows by looking at applications when the gravure roller and the substrate move in the same \ndirection at the nip with no impression roller (direct forward mode). Measurements of the \nfilm  thickness  variations  with  operating  conditions  and  the  determination  of  the  ribbing \ninstability and air entrainmemt limits are the objectives of this experimental investigation. \nAnother objective is to draw analogies with other coating flows to explain the key features of \nthe fluid mechanics of forward direct gravure coating. \n \n \n2 - EXPERIMENTAL METHODS \n \nThe experimental work was carried out on a pilot coater described schematically in fig. 3. It \nconsists essentially of a stainless steel frame with spring loaded bearing blocks which hold \nthe rollers perfectly horizontally by adjusting the dial microgauges on each side of the rollers \nshaft. The rollers and substrate (a 25 microns Melinex film) were independently driven. Three \ngravure rollers, a 220 quadrangular, a 85 trihelical and a 60 pyramidal (the number refers to \nthe number of cells per inch) with cell volume per unit area of roller surface Vc of 13.25, \n28.50 and 43.37 x 10\n-6 m\n3\/m\n2 respectively were used. These geometries, described in fig. 1, \nwere established using the Taylor Hobson replica method (essentially a means of obtaining a \nplastic duplicate of the surface which could be sliced into microns size cross sections and \nphotographed  under  a  microscope)  and  the  Talysurf  method  (essentially  a  means  of \nmeasuring a surface profile using a precision diamond tipped stylus attached to a pivoting arm \nwhich can travel along the surface). All the rollers were 0.182 m wide and their diameter D \nwas 0.1 m. In the direct mode of operation, an additional variable is the wrap angle \uf071W of the \nsubstrate round the gravure roller. To assess this effect, four wrap angles, 0, 4.0, 10.0 and \n14.5 degrees were tested. The applied web tension was monitored using an air operated unit \n(the Mount Hope total tension indicator system) which indicated the average web tension of \nthe moving web as it travelled over a load sensing idler roller. In all the experiments the web \ntension was maintained at 450 N\/m and the thickness hS of the film formed on the substrate \nwas measured using an infra-red thickness gauge suitably calibrated and accurate to +\/-0.5 \nmicrons. The onset of air entrainment and ribbing, was assessed visually under good lighting \nconditions, using repeat experiments. In the study six water based Newtonian solutions were \ntried and their viscosities, \uf06d\uf02c and surface tensions, \uf073\uf02c were in the range 1 - 14 x 10\n-3 Pa.s and \n30 - 67 x 10\n-3 N\/m respectively as measured using the Brabender Rheotron viscometer and \nthe drop-weight method. Table 1 shows the range of the experimental conditions used. In \nkeeping with the application of gravure coating, high viscosity fluids were not tested as they \ngenerate high hydrodynamic loads beneath the doctor blade and this violates the essential \ncondition  for  true  gravure  that  a  surplus  film  must  not  form  over  the  cells  (Patel  and \nBenkreira, 1991). \n \n \n3 - AIR ENTRAINMENT AND RIBBING INSTABILITIES \n \nThe first set of experiments was designed to establish broadly the stability window (onset of \nair entrainmement and\/or ribbing) and study its features. UG and US being the speeds of the \ngravure roller and the substrate, respectively, experiments were carried out at a constant speed \nratio S \uf0ba UG \/ US from 0.5 to 1.5 in steps of 0.25 for US varying from 10 to 40 m\/min (well   4 \ninto the unstable regime) in steps of 10 m\/min. From the results obtained, a second set of \nexperiments  was  designed  to  draw  more  precisely  the  envelope  of  the  stability  window. \nSubstrate speeds of 5, 7.5, 10 and 20 m\/mn were used and the gravure roller speed was \nincreased from 10 to 100 m\/mn in steps of 10 m\/mn. In total, with four wrap angles, six \nliquids and three gravure geometries, about 1100 data points were recorded. \n \nWhen  the  substrate  speed  was  higher  than  the  gravure  roller  speed  (i.e.  US  >  UG),  air \nentrainment  in  the  form  of  evenly  spaced  lines  of  fine  bubbles  always  developed  in  the \nmachine  direction.  To  avoid  it  at  a  given  UG,  US  had  to  be  decreased  considerably  in \ncomparison, until the limit of air entrainment, USA was reached. At that point, an increase of \nthe  gravure  roller  speed  prevented  air  entrainment  and  the  operation  was  stable.  Further \nincreases of UG however, led, at a critical UGR , to the appearance of ribbing instabilities. \nRibbing manifested itself as in other coating flows with evenly spaced uniform down-web \nlines ondulating the surface of the coating. For a given combination of liquid, gravure roller \nand wrap angle, plotting the data obtained as in fig. 4, in terms of the gravure roller speed UG \nagainst the substrate speed US shows the map of the stable window to be bounded by a low air \nentrainment  curve  and  a  high  ribbing  instability  curve.  The  low  curve  steepens  as  the \nsubstrate  speed  increases  and  a  maximum  coating  speed  was  found  above  which  air \nentrainment always occured. On the top right part of the curve, air entrainment and ribbing \noccured together. The results shown in fig. 4 are typical of all the data obtained. As detailed \nbelow, they may be interpreted as the combination of the classical ribbing instability window \nobserved with smooth forward roll coating (Pitts and Greiller, 1961 ; Benkreira et al, 1982 ; \nCoyle et al., 1990b) and the transition from stable flow to air entrainment and \/ or rivulet flow \ndisplayed by transfer coating (slide coating for example) and often refered to as the low-flow \nlimit of coatability (Gutoff and Kendrick, 1987). \n \nAs for the mechanisms, the ribbing instability must be linked to the formation of a meniscus \nand films on the substrate and the gravure roller on exit from the nip. The picture is very \nsimilar to smooth forward roll coating. In smooth forward roll coating, the onset of ribbing \ndepends  on  the  gap  over  diameter  ratio  and  on  the  average  capillary  number \nCam \uf0ba \uf06d [UG + US ] \/ 2\uf073 (Benkreira et al, 1982 ; Coyle, 1992). In gravure coating no gap is \npreset between the roller and the substrate but an appropriate dimension is the equivalent cell \ndepth Vc. Thus, if we plot the data obtained with a single gravure roller but different liquids \nin terms of the gravure roller capillary number CaG \uf0ba \uf06d\uf0a0 UG \/ \uf073 against the substrate capillary \nnumber CaS \uf0ba \uf06d\uf0a0 US \/ \uf073\uf0a0\uf02c  a master curve for the ribbing instability should be obtained. This is \nshown in fig. 5 with a zero wrap angle. For comparison purposes, we have also plotted in \nfig. 5 the straight lines Cam = Ca*, where Ca* is the capillary number for the onset of ribbing \nin symmetric forward roll coating computed by Coyle et al. (1990b) as a function of the gap \nover diameter ratio (which here must be taken as Vc \/ 2D in the roll and plate configuration). \nCalculated values of Ca* for the three gravure geometries are reported in table 2. It should be \nemphasised that comparing our results with Ca* presents some risks since this presupposes \nthat the onset of ribbing does not depend on the speed ratio. Indeed it can be seen that the \nstable domain in fig. 5 can hardly be bounded by a straight line of slope -1 (that is of constant \naverage capillary number). Rigourously speaking, the onset of ribbing in our experiments did \nnot depend on the average capillary number Cam but rather on CaS and CaG independently, \nwhich in fact is in agreement with the recent experimental findings of Decr\u00e9 et al. (1996). \nIrrespective of such details, it can be seen in fig. 5 that in forward gravure high capillary \nnumbers  and low Vc favour ribbing altogether, as it is the case when smooth rollers are   5 \nconsidered. However, the results show that the Vc gap constitutes only a crude approximation \nfor the prediction of the onset of ribbing. As a general rule, gravure roll coating is more prone \nto  ribbing  than  expected  from  the  data  of  smooth  roll  coating  with  the  Vc  gap.  This  is \nparticularly obvious with the 220 quadrangular geometry, for which no stable coating could \nbe obtained. Conversely, the analogy with smooth roll coating is fairly good with the 85 \ntrihelical geometry. These results suggest that the shape of the individual cells of the gravure \nroller also plays a role in the ribbing instability and that at constant Vc the trihelical geometry \nmust  be  the  most  stable  one.  Further  experiments  using  gravure  rollers  having  the  same \nvolume factor Vc but different cell geometries would be useful to confirm this hypothesis. \n \nOn the other hand, the flow situation in gravure coating resemble that encounterred in transfer \ncoating processes since a controllable flow rate that can be expressed here as Q = UG Vc is \ndelivered to the substrate. Transfer coating flows such as slide coating are subject to limits \nbeyond which uniform coating cannot be achieved and the coating breaks down into evenly \nspaced rivulets and \/ or air is entrained (Gutoff and Kendrick, 1987). At a given flow rate, the \ncoating speed cannot be increased above a critical speed. Similarly, at a given substrate speed, \nthe flow rate cannot be decreased below a critical value. These two limits are actually one and \nthe same and are known as the low-flow limit of coatability. For a given liquid, there is also a \nmaximum speed above which stable coating is impossible regardless of the flow rate. All \nthese trends can be observed from the data obtained with regard to air entrainment in gravure \nroll coating. The fact that air entrainment manifested itself as evenly spaced lines of fine \nbubbles rather than in an erratic manner supports the analogy with the low-flow limit of \ncoatablity  in  slide  coating.  Moreover,  plotting  the  data  obtained  with  the  three  gravure \ngeometries and different liquids in terms of the flow rate Q = UG Vc as a function of the \nsubstrate  capillary  number  CaS  results  in  a  mastercurve  showing  the  low-flow  limit  of \ncoatability of gravure coating. This is shown in fig. 6 with zero wrap angle. The range of film \nthicknesses (or flow rates) and capillary numbers involved in gravure roll coating are very \ndifferent than those in slide coating, so that a quantitative comparison of the low-flow limits \nof  coatability  in  both  flow  situations  is  not  possible.  Nevertheless,  drawing  the  analogy \nbetween gravure and slide coating is  very instructive. As in  slide coating, high substrate \nspeeds and high viscosity liquids favour air entrainment. On the other hand, air entrainment is \ncleared  by  increasing  the  flow  rate  supplied  to  the  substrate,  and  this  explains  why  air \nentrainment is cleared by increasing the speed of the gravure roller. For the same reason, \ngravure rollers having a large volume factor Vc are less prone to air entrainment. Conversely, \nthe results indicate that the shape of the individual cells of the gravure roller is at most a \nsecond order parameter with regard to the air entrainment problem, since the data obtained for \nthe three gravure geometries fall on the same mastercurve as shown in fig. 6. \n \nIn  conclusion,  the  complex  stability  window  in  forward  gravure  roll  coating  can  be \nunderstood using the double analogy of gravure roll coating with smooth roll coating and \ntransfer coating methods. Not surprisingly, high substrate speeds and high viscosity liquids, \nor equivalently high substrate capillary numbers CaS, favour both ribbing and air entrainment. \nAs a result, stable coating operations could not be run at substrate capillary numbers CaS \nabove 10\n-2 (with zero wrap angle). The role of the speed of the gravure roller UG is more \ncomplex. High UG retard air entrainment by increasing the flow rate supplied to the substrate, \nbut also favour ribbing by increasing CaG and hence the average capillary number Cam. For a \ngiven gravure geometry and a given liquid, the speed of the gravure roller hence the film \nthickness that can be applied at a given substrate speed (see next section) is then bounded by \na minimum and a maximum. On the other hand, low values of the cell volume factor Vc   6 \nfavour both ribbing and air entrainment. As a result, uniform coating could not be possibly \nachieved using the 220 quadrangular gravure roller of small Vc = 13 \uf06dm. The results also \nsuggest that an optimum design of the shape of the cells of the gravure roller would have no \neffect on air entrainment but could slightly stabilise the flow with regard to ribbing. \n \n \nAn additional variable as mentioned earlier is the wrap angle of the substrate around the \ngravure roller. The data presented in fig. 7 show that as the wrap angle was increased the \nstability window widened, with both air entrainment and ribbing onsets retarded to higher \nspeeds. For instance, it was found that for a given gravure roller capillary number CaG a wrap \nangle  greater  than  10\u00b0  could  increase  by  50  to  100  %  the  maximum  substrate  capillary \nnumber CaS at which stable coating operation was possible. These trends are consistent with \nsimilar observations reported in both forward roll coating and transfer coating. When the \nwrap angle is not zero, the tension of the web results in a load that pushes the substrate \nagainst the gravure roller, and the system becomes elastohydrodynamic. The stability of the \nelastohydrodynamic  flow  between  a  smooth  roller  and  a  tensioned  web  is  very  little \ndocumented in the open literature. However, Carvalho and Scriven (1996) showed that the \nonset  of  ribbing  in  a  two-roll  coater  is  delayed  when  deformable  rolls  are  used,  which \nsuggests that elastohydrodynamic roll coating systems in general are less prone to ribbing. \nSimilarly, elastohydrodynamic transfer coating systems such as tensioned-web slot coating \nare less subject to air entrainment (Pranck and Coyle, 1997), as the extra pressure arising \nfrom the web tension via the wrap angle assists dynamic wetting. Therefore, the stabilising \neffect of the wrap angle in gravure roll coating can be explained. An immediate outcome of \nthis analysis is that when the wrap angle differs from zero the stability window must also \ndepend on the web tension and on the elastic properties of the substrate. The analysis also \nsuggests that the use of an impression rubber roller (see fig. 2) also widens the stability \nwindow, which was  actually observed during preliminary experiments reported elsewhere \n(Benkreira et al., 1996). \n \n \n4 - TRANSFERED FILM THICKNESS \n \nAs explained above, instabilities limited the speed of coating in all cases to less than 20 m\/mn \nequivalent to CaS ~ 0.02. Moreover, for a given substrate speed within that range, the speed of \nthe gravure roller was also bounded so that in practical terms the speed ratio S \uf0ba UG \/ US must \nbe between, say, 3 and 8 (see Benkreira et al., 1996). The coating window can be even \nnarrower or even does not exist, as with the 220 quadrangular geometry and no wrap angle. \nNevertheless,  in  order  to  understand  the  mechanisms  that  determine  the  final  coating \nthickness, it is worth including in the analysis the data for which air entrainment and \/ or \nribbing  were  observed,  as  this  widens  considerably  the  range  of  parameters  that  can  be \ninvestigated. \n \nWe found no effect of the substrate wrap angle on the coating thickness. The thickness hS of \nthe film deposited onto the substrate results from (1) the total flow rate which is supplied by \nthe gravure roller to the coating nip, Q = UG Vc , and (2) the film-splitting flow that occurs at \nthe exit of the nip, as part of the liquid remains trapped in the cells of the gravure roller while \nthe remainder is transfered onto the substrate. The results show that this film-splitting flow \nmay be described as a base flow similar to the film-splitting flow in smooth forward roll \ncoating, with a perturbation due to the presence of a gravure roller. It has been established   7 \nboth experimentally (Benkreira et al., 1981) and theoretically (Coyle et al., 1986) that the \nfilm-splitting flow of a Newtonian liquid between two smooth counterrotating rollers moving \nat speeds US and UG follows \n \n  QG \/ QS = (UG \/ US)\n1.65  ,                    (1) \n \nwhere QG and QS are the flow rates (film thickness \uf0b4 speed) carried by the rollers at the exit \nof the nip. Transposed to the gravure coating situation, with Q = QS + QG = UG Vc , eq. (1) \nexpressing the flux distribution can be rewritten as \n \n  S (Vc \/ hS) \u2013 1 = S\n1.65\n  .                    (2) \n \nEq. (2) was tested against experimental data as shown in fig. 8. In spite of a significant \nscattering,  the  cause  of  which  is  discussed  later,  the  data  in  the  log-log  plot  follow  the \ntheoretical slope of 1.65 fairly well, which confirms the similarity of film-splitting flows in \nsmooth and gravure forward roll coating. However, the experimental data appear to be shifted \nfrom the theoretical curve as they are best fitted by \n \n  S (Vc \/ hS) \u2013 1 = \uf062\uf020S\n1.65\n ,                    (3) \n \nwhere \uf062 is an asymmetry factor experimentally comprise roughly between 2 and 3. That \uf062 is \ngreater than unity expresses the fact that more liquid than predicted by eq. (1) remains in the \ncells of the gravure roller, i.e. that the gravure pattern hinders the transfer of the liquid onto \nthe substrate. Seen like this, \uf062\uf020may\uf020depend on the gravure geometry though this does not \nappear clearly in fig. 8 due to the scattering of the data. \n \nIn gravure coating operations, the dimensionless coating thickness, i.e. the ratio of the coating \nthickness to the cell volume factor of the gravure roller, is of practical interest. Eq. (3) leads \nto a simple expression of hS \/ Vc , \n \n  hS \/ Vc = S \/ (\uf062\uf020S\n1.65\n + 1) ,                  (4) \n \nwhich shows that for a typical speed ratio of 5 the dimensionless film thickness is less than \n1\/6. This value is half that measured by Benkreira and Patel (1993) in reverse gravure coating \nwhich was always about 1\/3 independently of the speed ratio. In other words, forward gravure \ncoating is capable to produce significantly thinner films than the reverse situation. This is \nnamely because forward gravure involves a film-splitting flow where the dimensionless film \nthickness is strongly dependent on the speed ratio. It is interesting to note that with a speed \nratio of 1 the dimensionless film thickness is practically the same whether the operation is \nconducted in the forward or in the reverse mode, as with S = 1 eq. (4) gives hS \/Vc comprised \nbetween 1\/3 and 1\/4. \n \nAs  mentioned  earlier,  a  significant  scattering  may  be  observed  in  fig.  8  where  the \nexperimental data of the flux distribution are plotted against the speed ratio only. This is due \nto the fact that the pick-up of the liquid from the cells of the gravure roller also depends on \nthe global hydrodynamic forces developed in the nip by the liquid, that is on the average \ncapillary number Cam. This is shown in fig. 9 where the dimensionless coating thickness is   8 \nplotted against Cam for two values of the speed ratio S. As explained above, increasing the \nspeed ratio decreases the dimensionless film thickness. Moreover, it is clear from fig. 9 that \nregardless of the gravure geometry increasing the average capillary number at constant speed \nratio  increases  the  dimensionless  film  thickness.  This  shows  that  global  viscous  forces \n(expressed by Cam) help to pull the liquid out the cells so that at high Cam the dimensionless \nfilm thickness gets closer to its corresponding value in smooth forward roll coating. \n \nIn summary, the dimensionless film thickness in forward gravure coating is a quite complex \nfunction of the operating parameters as it is determined independently by (1) the speed of the \ngravure roller which sets the flow rate supplied to the nip to the coating nip, (2) the speed \nratio which governs the film-splitting base flow as in forward roll coating, and (3) the average \ncapillary number (hence the average speed) that controls how perturbed is the film-splitting \nbase flow compared to the smooth roll coating case. The dimensionless film thickness may \nalso depend on the shape of the individual cells of the gravure roller but this effect could not \nbe assessed from our experimental results. \n \n \n5 - CONCLUSION \n \nThis  investigation  shows  that  direct  forward  gravure  coating  produces  very  thin films of \nthickness 15 - 20% at most of the equivalent cell depth compared to the 33% produced by \nreverse gravure. This process is also more flexible as it was shown that the film thickness \ndepends on operating parameters such as substrate and roller speeds, which is not the case in \nthe reverse mode of operation. These performances are related namely to the fact that forward \ngravure coating flow involves a film-splitting flow as in forward roll coating, whereas the \nflow situation in reverse gravure resembles more that observed in kiss coating where the \nliquid film carried by the applicator roller is wiped off by the substrate. \n \nHowever, it was shown that unloaded forward gravure coating combines the air entrainment \nand  ribbing  instabilities  observed  with  slide  coating  and  smooth  forward  roll  coating \nrespectively. These features result in a rather complex and very narrow coating window. In \nparticular uniform and air-free films can be applied only at low substrate speeds nominally \nless than 20 m\/min which limits the scope of applications. It was observed that gravure rollers \nwith high cell volume factor are less prone to instabilities. Wrapping of the substrate round \nthe roller also help stabilising the flow without altering the film thickness. \n \n \n \nACKNOWLEGEMENTS \n \nThe  support  of  the  ERASMUS  European  exchange  student  scheme  which  enabled  J.M. \nLeclercq  of  the  Faculte  Polytechnique  de  Mons,  Belgium  to  carry  out  most  of  the \nexperimental work, is gratefully acknowledged.
