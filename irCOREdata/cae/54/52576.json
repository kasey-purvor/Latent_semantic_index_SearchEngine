Increasing temperature is arguably the most important\nchange, as temperature influences physiological and ecological\nprocesses across biological scales, from genes to ecosystems.\nCurrent knowledge of observed and expected biological changes \u2013\nand the ecophysiological mechanisms that drive them \u2013 on land far\nexceeds that from ocean systems, largely because of the costly,\nlogistically-challenging nature of marine research and the\ninaccessibility of aquatic habitats [2]. For example, unlike in\nterrestrial habitats, where cloches have been used to experimen-\ntally elevate temperature over short to medium timescales to\ninvestigate community-level responses to simulated global warm-\ning [3,4], there have been few controlled manipulations of\ntemperature in the sea.\nAlthough it is logistically difficult to manipulate seawater\ntemperature for ecological field experiments, previous studies\nhave utilized natural or man-made thermal gradients to examine\nbiological responses to seawater warming over varying timescales\n[5,6]. For example, thermal discharge plumes from coastal power\nplants have provided the opportunity to collect valuable field data\nto show comprehensive and unexpected changes in marine\ncommunity structure in response to seawater warming [6,7].\nLonger term warming driven by thermal discharge plumes has\nalso facilitated empirical tests of ecological theories [6] However,\nwhile such approaches are clearly valuable, they are inherently\neither unreplicated or spatio-temporally confounded and also it is\nnot possible for the researcher to exert control of the warming\nregimes or treatments.\nAnother common approach that ecologists have adopted\nexamine the influence of environmental drivers on marine\nbiodiversity involves the use of settlement panels, which provide\nartificial habitat for the settlement and growth of sessile marine\norganisms. Settlement panels act as uniform, comparable\nreplicates that can be used to conduct manipulative experiments\non the influence of key physical and biological processes on\ncommunity structure. Assemblages colonising settlement panels\nhave been subjected to controlled manipulations of, amongst other\nfactors, physical disturbance, light levels, sedimentation, nutrient\nenrichment, competition and grazing pressure (e.g., [8,9,10,11]).\nHere, we developed this approach by manipulating temperature\non and around settlement panels to conduct highly novel in situ\nexperiments on the response of natural communities to simulated\noceanic warming.\nResults\nA \u2018hot-plate\u2019 system, in which electrically heated settlement\nplates were warmed in an experimental array (comprising 8 hot\nplates and 8 control plates), was deployed at 6m depth in the fully-\nsaline (35 psu) mouth of the micro-tidal Swan Estuary in Perth,\nAustralia (Fig 1A). The plate surface available for colonisation and\nthe boundary layer of water surrounding the plate were warmed to\n0.67uC (60.11 s.d., based on 860 hourly observations) above\nambient temperature, in situ, for 36 days (Fig. 1B). The\ntemperature of the Swan River decreased considerably during\nthe deployment, which was conducted in autumn, but the\ntemperature differential between hot plates and control plates\nremained relatively constant throughout the experiment (Fig. 1B).\nA typical fouling assemblage, dominated by colonial ascidians,\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 1 | e16050\nhydroids, bryozoans and barnacles, settled on the plates (Fig. 1D).\nDidemnum perlucidum was the major space occupier; it covered more\nthan twice the space on the hot plates than on the unheated\ncontrols (Fig. 1C; t-test on arc-sine transformed data, df=14,\nt = 1.56, P=0.15). This observation suggested that initial growth\nand\/or development and\/or recruitment of Didemnum perlucidum\nmay be enhanced by warmer substratum and seawater conditions.\nTotal dry biomass of the fouling assemblage was greater on hot\nplates than control panels (t-test on Ln transformed data, df=14,\nt = 1.91, P=0.07), again a likely consequence of accelerated\nrecruitment and\/or growth rates of early life stages under warmer\nconditions.\nFurther information on the behaviour of the thermal gradient\nover the hot-plate surface was obtained from an experimental\nflume system. The relationship between distance from the plate\nsurface and the magnitude of warming was examined under three\ndifferent flow regimes characteristic of the Swan River. Under low\nflow conditions, the heated boundary layer of water surrounding\nthe hot plate was in excess of 8 mm in depth, while a maximum\ntemperature differential of 3uC was achieved on the plate\u2019s surface\n(Fig. 2A). However, the thickness of the warmed boundary layer\nand the magnitude of the warming treatment were strongly\ninfluenced by increased flow rates (Fig. 2A). Even so, mean\nwarming of at least 0.2uC was recorded up to 4 mm from the\nplate\u2019s surface at both medium and high current speeds. Crucially,\nthe magnitude of warming across the hot plate surface was\nconsistent under all flow conditions (Fig. 2B).\nDiscussion\nWe have presented a useful technique to modify seawater\ntemperature in situ, which is analogous to previous manipulations\nof environmental factors influencing sessile assemblages on\nsettlement panels. As with other manipulations conducted at\nsmall scales, the hot plate system only modifies the immediate\nenvironment (i.e. a thin layer of water surrounding the plate\nsurface) and does not elevate the temperature of the water column\nor the substratum at large spatial scales. As such, the approach has\nsome limitations in that it does not affect larval survivorship,\nfecundity of the local population, adult physiology, or the pool of\nspecies available for colonisation; all of which will be strongly\ninfluenced by oceanic warming. The technique is therefore most\nsuited to experimentation on species that have short-lived (or no)\nlife cycle stages in the water column and are primarily influenced\nby conditions near the substratum, such as microbial biofilms and\nmany species of ascidians and macroalgae. Another limitation\nrelates to the physical extent of the warming treatment, which is (at\nmost) 10 mm in depth and is strongly influenced by water\nmovement across the plate. Consequently, the technique is most\nappropriate for examining small organisms or life stages that exist\nwithin the warmed boundary layer of water, and for experimen-\ntation in habitats that experience low to moderate water flow, such\nas many embayments, lagoons and lakes. Modifications to the\npanel structure and design to maximise the thickness of the\nwarmed boundary layer are ongoing.\nDespite these limitations, the hot plate approach described\nabove has clear benefits. The major advantage of the hot plate\nsystem is that it facilitates investigation on the effects of\ntemperature on larval choice, recruitment dynamics, growth and\ncalcification rates, community development and species interac-\ntions in real aquatic habitats. This is crucial, as much of the\nartificiality associated with laboratory, and even mesocosm,\napproaches is removed by conducting manipulations in real\nhabitats, which are characterised by natural environmental\nFigure 1. The \u2018hot plate\u2019 system was deployed in field (A) and seawater temperature 3 mm over the experimental settling surfaces\non both a hot plate and a control plate was recorded for the duration of the deployment (B). Panel C shows mean (6 S.E.) percent cover\nof Didemnum perlucidum and total biomass of the sessile assemblage on hot plates and controls (n = 8). Note change of scale on biomass plot, for\nclarity. A representative sessile assemblage covering a control (left) and hot (right) plate after 36 days is shown in panel D.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0016050.g001\nControlled Warming on Marine Community Structure\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 January 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 1 | e16050\nvariability and complex interactions that often cannot be\nsimulated under controlled conditions [12]. Manipulations can\nalso be conducted over various timescales, to simulate both\ngradual warming and short-term extreme events (i.e. heat waves),\nwhich are projected to increase in frequency with climate change\n[1]. Moreover, the system, which can be deployed in any aquatic\nhabitat, can be manipulated like \u2018standard\u2019 settlement plates and\nwill thus facilitate complex field experiments that combine\nmultiple stressors (i.e. temperature with disturbance frequency or\nnutrient enrichment) and examine species interactions (i.e.\ncompetition vs. facilitation) within functional communities. Finally,\nunlike thermal pollution studies, hot plate experiments conducted\nat different times and places would be comparable, which would\npermit testing of important climate-related ecological theories,\nsuch as the relative effects of warming on organisms inhabiting\npolar versus tropical systems and thermally stable versus thermally\nvariable environments.\nWith regards to the biological data from the field deployment,\nthe two key ecological responses to warming we recorded were an\nincreased coverage of the ascidian Didemnum perlucidum and a\ngreater total biomass of the sessile assemblage. The genus\nDidemnum includes community-altering invasive species, such as\nD. vexillum and D. perlucidum, which have been translocated from\ntheir native waters to new habitats on vessel hulls and in ballast\nwaters, sometimes with community-wide consequences [13].\nThere is some evidence to suggest that the growth and invasive\nsuccess of these species is correlated with increasing temperatures\nand reduced water quality [14,15]. However, very little is known\nabout Didemnum spp. in Western Australia and further research is\nurgently needed. The greater total biomass values we recorded on\nhot plates compared with controls was most likely due to either\nincreased recruitment or increased growth rates, or a combination\nof both. Again, more work is needed to investigate the relative\nimportance of these key biological processes in driving this pattern.\nThe potential for oceanic warming to cause an increase in\nbiofouling rates on artificial surfaces has been suggested previous-\nly, as microbial biofilm development may accelerate and\naggressive fouling seasons may lengthen, particularly in temperate\nregions [16,17]. Here, we observed greater fouling on warmer\nsurfaces; an observation that could have major implications for the\nmulti-billion dollar anti-fouling industry.\nMost predictions on the consequences of global warming on\nmarine biodiversity have been based either on climate envelope\nmodeling or on inferences from highly artificial laboratory\nexperiments, rather than from observations or manipulations\nconducted in real habitats. Although these approaches have\nprovided valuable information, they are limited in that they\ngenerally do not consider direct or indirect species interactions\nunder the influence of multiple stressors acting simultaneously\n[18], which even the most sophisticated mesocosms or computer\nmodels cannot simulate. Furthermore, most research has targeted\nindividuals or populations, while communities and ecosystems\nhave received far less attention [19]. These pressing knowledge\ngaps currently restrict our ability to predict, and plan for, the\neffects of oceanic warming on marine biodiversity and resources\n[19,20]. \u2018Scaling-up\u2019 results from small-scale experiments to make\npredictions about large-scale processes such as oceanic warming is\nchallenging [21], and such approaches have been criticised [22].\nHowever, it has been empirically demonstrated that small-scale\ninteractions can generate large-scale patterns [23], while small-\nscale field experiments have considerably improved understanding\nof the fundamental principles of ecology [24]. As such, information\non the influence of temperature on community structure, species\ninteractions and invasibility gained from field manipulations will\nenhance our ability to predict the consequences of global\nenvironmental change on marine biodiversity and resources. As\nassigning cause and effect is best achieved through experimental\nmanipulation under realistic conditions [25], the hot-plate system\nwill be a useful addition to the research \u2018toolbox\u2019 available to\nclimate scientists in that it will complement modeling, experimen-\ntal and observational approaches conducted at larger spatial scales.\nMaterials and Methods\nHot plates were similar in design to traditional and widely used\nsettlement panels (20620 cm) except that the surface of the panel\nand the surrounding boundary layer of water were electrically\nheated to levels above ambient temperature. The mean magnitude\nof warming achieved in the Swan River (,0.7uC) reflected\npresent-day increases above mean temperatures observed during\nheat waves [26], and the projected increase in mean sea\ntemperature by 2030 [1,27]. Warming was achieved by mounting\nan electrical heat trace, sealed in silicon, beneath an anodised\naluminium plate. Power was supplied to the heat trace via a 50 m\ncable that connected to a shore-based control unit and mains\npower supply. The magnitude of heat transfer through the\naluminium plate was a simple function of the applied voltage,\nwhich was calibrated prior to deployment. Each panel drew ,2A\nFigure 2. The relationship between distance from the hot plate\nsurface and magnitude of warming under different flow\nconditions (A). Mean temperature differentials (6SEM) between a\ncontrol and a hot plate were calculated from 15 readings taken during\none minute, following sufficient time for thermal gradients to stabilise.\nSee methods for details of flow conditions. Mean (6SEM) temperature\ndifference between control and hot plate at different positions across\nthe plate surface, under different flow conditions, is shown in panel B.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0016050.g002\nControlled Warming on Marine Community Structure\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 January 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 1 | e16050\ncurrent and 25V were applied to the hot plate system throughout\nthe deployment. Therefore, the hot plate system required a\nmaximum power input of 500 watts.\nData on the behaviour of the thermal gradient over the hot\nplate under different flow conditions were collected from a large\nexperimental flume facility. Unidirectional flow rates were selected\nto represent typical current speeds observed in the Swan River\nduring tidal cycles: low flow (,0.01 ms21), medium flow\n(,0.05 ms21) and high flow (,0.12 ms21). Flow was measured\nwith an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV); water velocity\n4 mm above the hot plate surface was recorded every second for\nten minutes (prior to taking temperature readings). Under each\nflow condition, the temperature of the boundary layer across the\nhot plate was recorded using high precision T-type temperature\nprobes mounted above the centre of the plate, perpendicular to\nflow direction. Thermal gradients were allowed to stabilise for\n10 minutes, after which temperature was recorded at 0\u20138 mm\ndistance from the surface of the plate every 4 seconds for a minute.\nThe mean difference (n = 15) between control and hot plate\ntemperatures were then calculated for each minute. Similarly,\ntemperature differentials across the surface of the hot plate (2 mm\nabove the plate\u2019s surface and parallel to flow direction), were\ncalculated under the different flow conditions.\nFor the field deployment, an experimental settling surface\n(woven shade cloth, 2 mm thick) was fixed to the aluminium plate\nto serve as substrata for colonisation by marine organisms. Pilot\nstudies showed that the shade cloth facilitated steady, constant\ndiffusion of warm water from the heated metal plate to the\nsurrounding water layer, while providing a suitable surface for\nrapid colonisation by marine fauna. The array was deployed - with\nplates facing downwards (to select for fauna rather than flora) and\nsuspended 1 m from the seabed \u2013 by scuba divers using an anchor\nweight at each corner, ropes and buoys. A temperature logger with\na needle-pin stainless steel probe was mounted onto a hot plate\nand a control plate (without altering water motion across the plate\nsurface) to record hourly observations. Following deployment, the\nshade cloth surfaces were removed from the hot plate system, and\nreturned to the laboratory. Encrusting fauna was identified to the\nlowest taxonomic level possible and percent cover of each taxon\nand total dry biomass were recorded for each plate.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Ray Scott for technical assistance and Gretchen Lambert and\nPatricia Mather for taxonomic advice.
