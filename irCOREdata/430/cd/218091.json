ISSN 1472-4790 \n \n \nIt has become common to highlight the desirability of a more \u2018politicised\u2019 EU so as to counter the low visibility \nof its policy-making and the disaffection this may breed.  Endorsing this view, the article argues existing \ncontributions to the topic tend to give insufficient attention to the relationship between institutional settings and \neveryday life, and to underplay the significance of how political actors interpret and reproduce the social and \npolitical world.  The article explores how one might reconsider these questions, drawing on some of the insights \nof cultural and pragmatic sociology to suggest that the important obstacles to further politicisation may be \nrooted in contemporary political culture.  A contribution is thereby intended both to the topic in question and to \na wider effort to supplement institutional perspectives in EU studies with those drawn from sociology.\n1\n  \n \n \n\u2018Politicisation\u2019 has become a term used widely in EU studies, an organising theme even.  Sometimes \nthe intended meaning is descriptive, as in the observation that the Brussels institutions have accrued \nresponsibilities extending well beyond the socio-economic tasks of market creation (the latter \nunderstood as non-political), or that matters European have become controversial in the domestic \npolitics of  EU member-states (Hooghe & Marks 2008) (van der Eijk & Franklin 2004).  Just as \noften it is understood as a goal.  Politicisation in this sense is advanced as a remedy for a Union in \nmalaise \u2013 a malaise originating in the way policy-making is pursued and the way citizens respond to \nit (Hix 2008).  These meanings are clearly entwined, but this article accepts the focus of the latter.  \nAt its core therefore is a political-theoretical concern, not just an empirical puzzle. \n  The common thread of these more normative approaches to politicisation is the desirability \nof EU policy-making being further subject to contestation.\n2\n  In a political system where non-elected \ninstitutions heavily inform policy-making, the practices of government take on a technocratic \ncharacter that tends to conceal the value choices embedded in decision-making (Tsakatika 2007).  \nThat the public good might be a matter for clashing and competing interpretations, and that this \nmight be essential to democratic politics, is commonly pushed to one side, either on the grounds that \nthere exists a broad consensus on the objectives of policy-making, or with the notion that the \n\u2018effectiveness\u2019 of outcomes would be unacceptably harmed if dissenting views were acknowledged \nand engaged at each stage.  Integration is in this sense \u2018by stealth\u2019 (Hayward 1996).  Some may treat \nthis as a matter of concern outright, and one can pursue an explicitly evaluative line of reasoning that \nseeks to show why such a set-up is undesirable and why politicisation is intrinsically of worth.  Such \n                                                 \n1\n Comments on an earlier draft were kindly offered by Volker Balli, Lea Ypi, Virginie van Ingelgom and fellow \nparticipants in the sociology workshop at the 2008 ECPR Joint Sessions in Rennes.  The author additionally \nthanks the editors responsible for this issue, two anonymous referees who helped improve the piece, and the \nAlexander von Humboldt Stiftung for funding a research fellowship at the Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin. \n2\n Such approaches are based on an adversarialist conception of democracy; its normative appeal is beyond the scope of \nthis article, but a good introduction is (Muirhead 2006). \n 2 \nan approach extends the \u2018normative turn\u2019 experienced in EU studies from the mid-1990s, in which \nthe EU\u2019s compatibility with democratic norms has been assiduously probed (Bellamy & Castiglione \n2003) (Chryssochoou 2000).\n3\n  Much of the existing literature on politicisation instead adopts a \nscientific perspective, arguing that the current arrangement has a negative effect on citizen attitudes \ntowards the EU, and thus that politicisation is instrumentally relevant to the sustainability of \nEuropean integration.  To synthesise a number of arguments, the thesis is as follows: since the \ncurrent EU regime offers few opportunities for organised political opposition, and those which exist \nhave traditionally been weakly structured along partisan lines, citizens who are dissatisfied with \nevents in Brussels have only the options either to disengage from political developments altogether, \nor to oppose the very idea of a European polity (Mair 2007).  For a minimum of consent to appear \none would instead need to see adversarial debate over opposing political programmes, for only then \nwould it be possible for dissent to be expressed towards EU policies without this entailing a rejection \nof the polity outright (Hix 2008).\n4\n  To be sure, even a politicised regime might ultimately come to be \nrejected, on grounds unrelated to the substance of its political programmes, but such an outcome \nwould express greater nuance and democratic clarity than existing conditions permit.  European \nintegration, one may summarise, suffers if it lingers in the shadows. \nContributions to this topic tend to give some accent to the significance of views and \npractices beyond the Brussels institutions.  The significance of public opinion, as something wider \nthan the interplay between decision-makers and a small number of interest groups, is emphasised as \na relevant factor in the EU\u2019s development (Hooghe & Marks 2008), whether on purely empirical \ngrounds or normative grounds also.  To a degree then, the advent of the politicisation problematic in \nEU studies already marks something of an endorsement of sociological lines of thought on the EU \n(de Wilde 2007).  If one can accept that a turn towards the wider European population(s) marks a \nshift towards the study of \u2018society\u2019, already one might want to speak circumspectly of a \u2018sociological \nturn\u2019, rather in the spirit of this special issue.  However, such a turn has so far been cursory.  There \nremains a need to study more closely not so much the behaviour of political representatives in \nBrussels but the extent to which citizens more widely attribute significance to this behaviour, and are \ninvited to do so by the schemes of interpretation on which they draw.  Moreover, there is a need to \nrethink more generally the nature of the relationship between political actors and society, and to \nintroduce a more reflexive and less functional conception of actors such as the political party.   \nAs will be argued, insofar as sociology can enrich this discussion, it requires that one resist \nreducing it to what some may consider its disciplinary core \u2013 the search for regularities of behaviour \nand the elaboration of non-individualist explanations for these \u2013 but that one treat it as a pluralistic \n                                                 \n3\n For a treatment of these issues consistent with the concerns of this article, see (White, 2010 a). \n4\n For the purposes of this article, let us set aside those who fear it may prove unfeasible to politicise the substance of EU \npolicy-making \u2013 its political ends \u2013 without politicising the procedures by which these are sought (Bartolini 2006).  \n 3 \ndiscipline in which certain strands may be more appropriate to given tasks than others.  The article \ntherefore discusses the kinds of sociology that should be brought into discussions of politicisation, \nand seeks to undermine an image of sociology either as consciously disengaged from questions of \npolitical theory, or as so intent on causal explanation that little theoretical space is preserved for the \nexercise of creative agency.  The merits of an interpretative political sociology are advanced, and \nsome lines of empirical investigation centred on the language and imagery of political action \ndescribed.  Indication is thereby given of how one might study the politico-cultural factors likely to \ninfluence the success of efforts to expose European integration to greater scrutiny and debate.  \n \n \nRethinking Politicisation \n \nMuch of the existing literature on the EU\u2019s politicisation proceeds from a focus on the decision-\nmaking of its institutions, principally (though not solely) the behaviour of representatives in the \nEuropean Parliament.\n5\n  It is supposed that if parties in the Parliament are able to consolidate \nthemselves by strengthening their organisational structures, forming stable coalitions with one \nanother, and displaying consistent voting behaviour amongst their members, then a clear set of \nelectoral choices will emerge which the voting public can engage with and thereby develop \nconfidence in the EU as a political arena.  The Parliament would then be in a position to push for \ngreater powers vis-\u00e0-vis the other Brussels institutions and to subject more areas of policy-making to \nparliamentary scrutiny, thus moving closer to the politicisation of the \u2018governance practices\u2019 of the \nEU.  Accordingly, empirical studies have looked at the stability of party groups in the Parliament, \nthe extent to which these regulate the voting preferences of representatives, and how far the relative \ndistribution of these preferences is consistent with their supposed distribution in the populations of \nthe EU member-states.  Researchers have conducted a series of sophisticated analyses of the voting \npatterns of MEPs seeking to establish whether a left-right axis can plausibly be projected onto their \nbehaviour (Hix 2008) (Hix 2002), or whether new lines of contestation have emerged (Hooghe & \nMarks 2008).   \n  Given that the premise for discussion is that many citizens are disconnected from, or hostile \nto, the processes of EU politics, this focus on the European Parliament may seem a suspect point of \ndeparture.  Important as it is to examine whether conflict between political representatives is in some \nway structured, and whether those structures match those ostensibly found in the wider populations \nof EU member-states, this can hardly be the basis for a full account of politicisation.  For even if one \nwere able to show a numerical correspondence between political structuring at the \u2018elite\u2019 and the \n\u2018mass\u2019 level, whereby political groupings such as left and right were equally represented in each, this \n                                                 \n5\n Decision-making in the Council and Commission is more rarely the focus, but see (Hix 2008). \n 4 \nwould not be sufficient to indicate an active relation between the two.  One would want to know not \njust whether there is adversarial debate taking place in Brussels that is consistent with wider political \nalignments, but whether such debate has public resonance.  Specifically, one would want to know \nmore about the extent to which citizens are aware of the conflicts taking place in Brussels, and the \nextent to which they look to them spontaneously as \u2018their\u2019 conflicts \u2013 i.e. conflicts in which they \nthemselves are subjects, rather than just disputes between obscure and\/or foreign elites.  One would \nalso be interested in the extent to which they see the policies these conflicts lead to as meaningful for \ntheir own experiences.  Matters of perception are crucial.  As or more important than whether \npolitical actors adapt, as organisations, to the new \u2018political opportunity structure\u2019 the EU offers to \nthem (Beyers and Kerremans 2004) is the social meaning attributed to the conflicts they engage in.   \n  This need not be an argument for the superiority of \u2018bottom-up\u2019 over \u2018top-down\u2019 \napproaches to the EU.  While some sociologists favour this language (Favell 2006), it is misleading \nif taken to imply a separation of spheres (e.g. the political and the social, or the elites and masses) or \na direction of causal dependence.\n6\n  There is no reason to accord a priority of ontology to the views \nand experiences of ordinary citizens over those of their political representatives, since arguably some \npolitical actors \u2013 political parties at the national level, for instance \u2013 may have a critical role to play \nin shaping common understandings and perceptions rather than simply responding to existing ones.  \nParties need not be thought of as passive mechanisms of representation, any more than lay citizens \nare a passive audience to their activities.  The key point is not that one should focus more on the \n\u2018bottom\u2019 than the \u2018top\u2019, but that one needs to focus on the relations that exist or do not exist across \nthe various sites of activity. \n  This connects to a second demand, which is to avoid the temptation to conceptualise \npolitical reality in terms of given, pre-political elements.  Most of the existing literature adopts an \naggregative perspective on politics, whereby political outcomes are decided by changes in the \nquantitative distribution of certain units, whether these be \u2018interests\u2019, \u2018preferences\u2019, or, in more \nconstructivist approaches, \u2018identities\u2019 and \u2018values\u2019.  Public opinion tends to be conceived as the sum \ntotal of these given elements, and politics as what happens after they have made their appearance on \nthe scene; after, for instance, preferences have been \u2018revealed\u2019.  Political parties are understood \naccordingly as the means by which these pre-existing units are aggregated and promoted in conflict \nwith those who oppose them, enabling them to be represented proportionately in the legislative \nchamber and, after a process of bargaining, to exert due influence on the course of policy-making \n(Lord 2006).  What tends to be given insufficient attention is the significance of the process by \nwhich these units are formed (or in some cases left ill-defined), and the combination of constraints \nand possibilities for political conflict this opens out. \n                                                 \n6\n Similarly problematic is the familiar distinction between \u2018demand-side\u2019 and \u2018supply-side\u2019 accounts of political \nbehaviour.   \n 5 \n  Take for example cleavage theory, a common analytical perspective in the EU literature \nwhich sees the emergence of political preferences as a function of societal cleavages, notably those \nbased on class, religion, and centre-periphery relations.  In the classic rendition, such divisions are \nunderstood to be highly stable or \u2018frozen\u2019 (Lipset and Rokkan 1967), while in more recent accounts \nsome emphasis is placed on the gradual emergence of new cleavages resulting from the shift to post-\nindustrial society (Marks, Wilson and Ray 2002).  The politicisation of the EU thus involves politics \nat the European level coming to be structured by these societal cleavages.  Such an approach has a \ncertain appeal, in that it keeps focus on the substantive ends around which political conflict takes \nplace, something that may be a key factor in its wider resonance.  Yet it neglects the extent to which \nsocietal cleavages are susceptible to purposeful redescription.  Political actors arguably have a \ndecisive role in interpreting the social and political world, and thereby elaborating the terms on \nwhich political conflict takes place.  Their decisions are an important influence on which images of \nsociety are maintained and reproduced, which fall out of currency, and which new ones emerge.  The \ndanger of a cleavage-based perspective is that it downplays these choice-laden and potentially \ncreative interventions.7  It tends instead towards a kind of \u2018groupism\u2019: citizens come to be seen \nprimarily as a function of their background \u2013 as the bearers of economic and socio-cultural structure, \nwhether in the form of \u2018interests\u2019 or \u2018identities\u2019.  Equally problematically, political conflict comes to \nbe conceived in sedimented and dualistic terms without sensitivity to the ongoing possibilities for its \ntransformation.\n8\n   \n  Aggregation of some kind is always likely to be a central feature of democracy, given the \nimportance of voting and the principle of majority rule.  But some of the most politically significant \ndevelopments occur well before the moment of aggregation, in the constitution of the field in \nquestion.  A richer account of politicisation requires that one look into the formation of \n\u2018preferences\u2019, and further that one do this in ways that avoid reifying certain social divisions and \nassociated social groupings.  One needs to keep open, and make the subject of study, the \nconstruction of the constituencies to which political actors appeal and the ends which they seek to \npromote on their behalf.   \n  This may be particularly so for two reasons.  First, one of the widely observed tendencies \nin contemporary democracies is the rise of electoral instability, i.e. the decreasing willingness of \ncitizens to display blind loyalty to one party but to reconsider their attachments from one election to \nthe next, and for parties likewise to target new voters.  Socio-cultural cleavages seem to be \n                                                 \n7\n The more sophisticated accounts recognise this point (Hooghe and Marks 2008, p.23), but generally maintain it as an \naxiom rather than a pointer to one of the key aspects of political conflict. \n8\n Note that there is a further dimension to this, to do with the epistemological commitments of political science which \nweigh strongly in favour of causal explanation as the goal of political analysis.  Explanations and predictions of \nbehaviour require the starting assumption that it is fairly structured and that orientations are durable across time.  There \nis a strong temptation then to treat these as a function of socio-economic and cultural facts, and thereby as regulated by \nlarger principles.  The significance of interpretation, and the openness to re-interpretation, causes problems for a rigidly \nscientific perspective. \n 6 \ndecreasingly reliable as a guide to voting behaviour and party politics (Mair 2008).  This should \nalready alert us to the potential importance of more interpretative perspectives which make fewer \nassumptions about the nature of social ties and their implications for political action.  But second, \nalso the peculiarities of the transnational context invite one to be particularly sensitive to departures \nfrom the conventional socio-cultural groupings.  Adversarial political conflicts at a European level, \ninsofar as they develop, are likely to entail the emergence of new forms of collective identification, \nnew ways of understanding collective interests, and new narratives that invoke the EU as a plausible \nmeans to address shared political problems.  When studying the prospects for the EU\u2019s politicisation, \none needs to be particularly sensitive then to how the social and political world is interpreted and re-\ninterpreted \u2013 and thereby changed, transformed or reproduced \u2013 and the factors influencing this.   \n  Rethinking how one theorises politicisation is likely to require rethinking the methods by \nwhich it is empirically researched.  Much of the work on this subject relies on data drawn from \nopinion polls and voting records, whether centred on party representatives or lay citizens.  These \ntechniques seem insufficient for a number of reasons.  First, they sit uneasily with the starting \nassumption that large numbers of citizens are weakly engaged in the activities of the EU.  If this is \nso, opinion polls are likely to tap rather superficial opinions, while voting data will inevitably report \non the behaviour only of an active and engaged minority (cf. the low percentages that vote in \nEuropean elections).  These are problems essential to the method: polls necessarily direct the \nrespondent\u2019s attention towards the topic of research interest, and are therefore always liable to inflate \nthe respondent\u2019s level of concern with it.  Rather than asking people for their opinions on \u2018Europe\u2019 \nand the EU, and classing responses with cluster-terms such as \u2018euro-scepticism\u2019, what is needed are \nstudies that explore the extent to which these form natural reference-points in people\u2019s everyday \nlives.  One needs methods that can study dis-engagement and in-action, i.e. the behaviour of a silent \nmajority.   \n  Second, polling methods are ill-suited to studying matters of interpretation and the \nideational world, which are central to the study of political conflict.  Polls are designed to aggregate \nsuccinct items of information which can then be analysed for patterns of correlation and compared \nacross time and space: hence the focus on responses to short-answer questioning.  If, on the other \nhand, one wants to study people\u2019s level of involvement in political conflict and the extent to which \nthey feel implicated in its outcome, one will want to examine a whole series of complex issues to do \nwith how they understand the nature of politics and political agency, how far they connect problems \nin everyday life to wider struggles, how they define the \u2018we\u2019 who is engaged in these struggles, and \nhow far they see these problems as susceptible to collective address.  Likewise when looking at \norganised political actors, one will be interested not simply in whether labels such as \u2018left\u2019 or \u2018right\u2019 \ncan be feasibly attached to certain individuals, nor even whether those individuals themselves accept \nsuch labels, but in the deeper patterns of assumption in which such concepts are enmeshed, and \n 7 \nwhich enable and constrain the engagement in adversarial politics.  Crucially, these are all aspects of \ntacit understanding, part of the taken-for-granted practical knowledge that structures behaviour and \nthe formation of opinions.  Opinion-poll researchers do not engage in the in-depth probing required \nto uncover these tacit aspects \u2013 this is not goal they set themselves \u2013 and therefore an alternative, \nmore interpretative set of methods is likely to be necessary.  As will be indicated below, certain \nethnographic approaches developed in political sociology are of particular relevance here.  \n \n    \nTowards an Interpretative Political Sociology \n \nSo far little has been said about the need for more \u2018sociological\u2019 perspectives and the kind of \nsociology which might be required.  Perhaps from the perspective of a student of politics this will \nseem natural enough: other disciplines tend to seem more homogeneous than one\u2019s own, and many \npolitical scientists may feel they have a good sense of what a \u2018sociological account\u2019 would entail.  \nBut this may be because the penetration of political study by sociology has so far been limited to a \nrather narrow range of sociological ideas.  By far the most common appropriations have been from \nTalcott Parsons\u2019 structural functionalism, leading to a large number of political-scientific works \nwhose sociological component is an emphasis on norms and values (Favell 2005).  This represents of \ncourse just a small fraction of sociology\u2019s intellectual resources, and arguably one which is \ndisconnected from contemporary social-theoretical developments (Reckwitz 2002).  Moreover, they \nmay be amongst the least appropriate for incorporation into political study.  The figure of homo \nsociologicus as the passive follower of law-like norms and the unreflexive creature of values seems \nremote indeed from the ideas of human freedom that underpin even the most minimalist \nunderstanding of democracy.  A sociology whose prime concern is with the identification of \nbehavioural regularities, and which therefore has determinist implications, is likely to fit awkwardly \nwith research that has a political-theoretical dimension.  Particularly a research field such as the \npresent one, to do with the polity-forming effects of adversarial conflict, resists combination with \nsuch a perspective, given that collective political struggle involves a critical disposition towards the \nstatus quo and a degree of reflexivity about the ends worthy of pursuit.   \n  Some of the more promising work may instead be found in recent contributions to cultural \nand pragmatic sociology (Lamont and Th\u00e9venot 2000) (Boltanski and Th\u00e9venot 2006) (Sewell \n2005).  At the most general level, the appeal of these approaches lies in their combined attention to, \non the one hand, the macro features of the symbolic world which lay down certain parameters to \nwhat people are able and willing to do, and which encourage certain courses of action over others, \nand on the other hand the possibilities which remain open to individuals in specific situations to \nexert some level of choice in their actions and thereby to influence and reshape those same social \n 8 \nstructures.  The notion of \u2018cultural availability\u2019 is used to give a sense of both structure and agency \nwithout prioritising one to the exclusion of the other, and without parcelling up the social world into \nneatly defined groups marked by high levels of internal homogeneity.  The result is a perspective \nwhich avoids an a-sociological tendency to voluntarism, since it is recognised that actors proceed \nfrom a limited range of ideational resources, yet which also allows space for interpretation and \ncreativity, and thus the exercise of political will \u2013 two prerequisites of an adequate approach to a \ntopic such as politicisation.   \n  Moreover, to a greater degree than earlier formulations of the duality of structure, these \napproaches translate well into programmes for empirical research.  As several works have indicated, \nthe study of symbolic boundaries, cultural repertoires, orders of worth, discursive practices, and \nmodes of justification and critique, can be brought together with rich results (Lamont and Th\u00e9venot \n2000) (Boltanski and Chiapello 2006) (Lamont and Moln\u00e1r 2002).  In one notable instance, using as \ncase-studies two environmental disputes in France and the US, Laurent Th\u00e9venot and his co-authors \nexamine the varied logics of argumentation actors pursue when seeking to justify their political \npositions and the wider cultural patterns these express.  As part of their findings, they show how \nparticipants to dispute generally seek to ground their views by appealing to the public good, and that \nhow they construe this good varies in culturally significant ways.  Actors show a marked tendency to \nevoke certain evaluative registers and forms of evidence more frequently than others: in the US case \n(more so than the French one), market-based conceptions of worth are regularly offered, backed by \ncost-benefit data emphasising the potential revenue and economic growth offered by a certain course \nof action and the dubious worth of opposing proposals.  How this register of evaluation comes to be \nmatched against alternative ones also differs across settings: in the one, a market-based notion of \nworth comes to be articulated with civic and green notions, as public opinion and environmental \nsustainability are invoked as supporting ideas, while in the other market values are regarded as \nantithetical to these notions and explicitly criticised from such viewpoints (Th\u00e9venot, Moody and \nLafaye 2000).  The study provides a rich empirical indication of how political actors may deploy \ncultural resources to pragmatic effect in the micro situation while at the same time exhibiting \ndispositions that are ordered at the macro level.  While presented as a cross-national comparison, its \nmore general significance lies in highlighting the role played by prevalent structures of meaning in \nshaping the forms that political conflict takes.  Interpretative research methods such as these offer \ngood possibilities for combination with established approaches inspired by ethnographers such as \nErving Goffman (frame analysis in particular) and with the wide range of textualist approaches \ninspired by the philosophy of Austin and the later Wittgenstein. \n  How might such ideas be brought to bear on the study of political conflict in the EU?  First \nthey are suggestive of how one might re-conceptualise the conditions for politicisation.  Adopting \nthe idea of cultural availability, one can propose that political adversarialism at a European level \n 9 \nrequires the widespread availability in EU populations of those ideational resources that can \u2018make \nsense\u2019 of the EU as a political arena and invite citizens to participate in efforts to influence its \npolitical agenda.  Amongst such elements will be, for instance, basic assumptions about the \nexistence of political problems in need of address; ways of seeing these problems (e.g. their origins \nand their effects) such that proposals to tackle them at a specifically European level can be made to \nseem justifiable; and certain forms of collective identification which cut across national boundaries \nand thereby give meaning to political conflict at a transnational level.  Such elements need not be \ncognitivised and treated as the properties of specific individuals (as beliefs, identities, personal \nvalues, etc.), but can be seen as repertoires commonly available to them as part of the social world \nthey inhabit.   \n  Second, these social-theoretical ideas point to how any advance in politicisation will \ndepend on the ability of actors in society to elaborate and diffuse new ideational resources of the \nkind described.  One may suppose this type of innovation is most likely amongst those who are \npolitically organised, who command media attention and have the opportunity to lend governmental \nauthority to their ideas \u2013 amongst the activists who make up national political parties, social \nmovements and certain think-tanks, for example.  Yet seeing politicisation as ultimately a matter of \ndiscursive innovation allows one to avoid a purely institutional focus, and the attendant separation of \nthe social and political spheres, since one need make no overarching assumption about the lesser \nsignificance of other sites of activity.  Furthermore, this perspective allows one to sidestep the \ntendency towards a groupist ontology: not only can one avoid seeing the basis of political conflict in \nterms of fixed social configurations ordered by material determinants in the manner of cleavage \ntheory, but one can also see the protagonists themselves as complex ideational constellations rather \nthan bounded social units.  Parties and social movements, for example, can be treated not so much as \nunitary actors whose behaviour is structured by clearly defined organisational interests, but as \nevolving compromises between different sets of symbolic boundaries and evaluative registers, the \ndifferent elements of which may come to the fore differently in the particular situation. \n  Third, this perspective directs attention towards the constraints on those who would seek to \nintroduce and promote the kind of innovation described.  It suggests these constraints may consist \nnot so much in unambiguous social facts but in the ways the social and political world comes to be \nrepresented and experienced (Lamont and Th\u00e9venot 2000).  One may suppose that the ability of \npolitically motivated citizens such as movement activists to re-imagine the social and political world, \nand thus engage in adversarial politics to promote new ways of conceiving it, is limited by the \nideational conditions in which they find themselves.  For like all citizens they operate within a field \nof sedimented meanings and taken-for-granted ideas \u2013 a field that depends largely on their choices \nfor its reproduction, but one constraining to the individual actor nonetheless.  The ability to articulate \nchallenges to the status quo \u2013 the essence of politicisation \u2013 depends on the availability of vantage-\n 10 \npoints in this field from which to develop critiques (Boltanski and Chiapello 2006).  At risk of \noverstating its uniformity, one might speak of this field as the political culture such actors inhabit.  \nNot the least of its sources will be the successful ideational initiatives of other political actors past \nand present, whose achievements determine their point of departure.  \n  A common objection to perspectives such as these is that they are insufficiently attentive to \nthe non-symbolic forms of social structure apt to bear on political action just as much as does the \ndistribution of \u2018repertoires\u2019, ideational resources, and the like.  The way in which, for instance, \neconomic, institutional and legal structures relate to structures of symbolic practice is arguably \nunder-explored in these approaches, notwithstanding some of the positive consequences of this \nneglect \u2013 notably that the space for political agency is not closed prematurely \u2013 and notwithstanding \nthe fact that it need not deprive these approaches of their potential relevance to social and political \ncritique (Silber 2003).  Sociologists in the Bourdieusian tradition will want to know more about the \nkinds of social structure which grant added authority to the efforts of some actors to order and \ncapitalise on the symbolic world, and about the kinds of influence bound up in the properties of the \nspeaker (Bourdieu 1991).  Such concerns need not however trigger a return to the familiar array of \nsociological approaches which set up a hierarchy of structures and make it axiomatic that the \nsymbolic-ideational is determined by factors external to it.  Instead, what is needed is the study of \nthe interplay between material and symbolic aspects of reality in the particular moment.  Asserting \nthat the structures of the ideational world are never fully determined by institutional, legal and \neconomic structures by no means precludes the examination of how, in given historical instances, \nchanges in the latter may open up or narrow down the possibilities for change in the former \n(Th\u00e9venot, Moody and Lafaye 2000).  Moments of political and economic crisis, whether in the \nextreme cases of war, revolution and economic catastrophe, or in the more prosaic cases of political \nscandal and economic uncertainty, may be when understandings of the social and political world are \nmost susceptible to change.\n9\n  Ideational structures may thus be \u2018disciplined\u2019 by changes in the \nmaterial world without being sharply determined by them.   \n \n \nSome Lines of Empirical Research \n \nThere are a number of research projects which might proceed from these reflections.  The first would \nbe to study the extent to which, in the sense outlined, contemporary EU politics can be judged as \n(de)politicised.  An existing line of research has examined for instance the degree to which ordinary \ncitizens recognise problems needing public address, the extent to which they see political institutions \n                                                 \n9\n An absorbing study of the interplay between ideological and socio-economic practices in the wake of the French 1968 \nis (Boltanski and Chiapello 2006). \n 11 \nas a plausible means to tackle them, and how far they invoke the EU as the relevant political arena.  \nA tendency to evoke \u2018problems without solutions\u2019 suggests the ideational resources required to make \nsense of political conflict and political agency may be somewhat lacking, and the ensuing political \nfatalism poses a challenge for political authority at the national as well as the European level (White \n2009) (White, 2010 b).  A second field of study would look at some of the obstacles that exist to the \nemergence of more positive ideational resources.  Principled euro-scepticism is undoubtedly one: \nthose opposed to the idea of a European polity clearly have no incentive to make available the kinds \nof perspective that would support it.  In other cases, insights can undoubtedly be drawn from some \nof the existing accounts of politicisation that point either to the internal dynamics of parties (Ladrech \n2007), to the incentives created by the allocation of institutional competences within the EU regime \n(Lord 2006), or to the constraints posed by existing ideational commitments developed within the \ncontext of the nation-state (Bartolini 2005).  But, drawing on the sociological approaches outlined \nabove, it should be possible to identify further factors of significance to do with key features of \ncontemporary European political culture.  Without pre-empting its systematic study, one might point \nto a few sensitising ideas as follows.   \n  First, it has been widely noted that political debate has come to be played out in the \nlanguage and imagery of the individual.  Parties, for instance, are styled increasingly around \nindividual personalities rather than programmatic ideas: the projected image of party leaders \u2013 their \nsupposed strength of character, their personal beliefs, their \u2018back-story\u2019 \u2013 becomes the key elements \nin the party \u2018brand\u2019, resulting in a trend towards so-called \u2018celebrity politics\u2019 (Meyer and Hinchman \n2002).  Parties tend increasingly also to articulate their constituency in atomised terms (as the tax-\npayer, the consumer, etc.) rather than as one or several collective agents.\n10\n  Collective forms of \nsubjecthood, such as those based on left and right, are deployed less frequently, and more weakly \nconnected to distinctive political programmes (Furedi 2005).  While political groupings based on left \nand right may persist as organisational denominations and intellectual constructs, they may slowly \nbe being emptied of their wider resonance (a trend which, gradual and even temporary though it may \nbe, is another reason to be sceptical of studies of politicisation centred mainly on the voting patterns \nof political representatives).  Importantly, the decision to adopt such strategies is in no sense \ninevitable: arguably they are induced not so much by the demands of modern politics, the modern \nmedia, or by processes of globalisation, but by the assumptions which partisans and others make of \nthese (Meyer and Hinchman 2002).  The outcome is that political debate comes to be \u2018starved\u2019 of the \ncollective forms of identification needed for will-formation and the advance of political claims.  \nPolitical sociologists have observed that one of the crucial stimuli to political engagement on the part \n                                                 \n10\n Cf. for instance debates in European countries from 2007 onwards concerning whether to guarantee the survival of \nprivate banks with public funds: the key question was repeatedly framed as \u2018will the taxpayer get their money back?\u2019  \nSuch formulations individualise the public, and emphasise the constraints and burdens that fall on individuals rather than \na wider public, as well as positioning these individuals as passive spectators of developments elsewhere. \n 12 \nof citizens is the availability of a sense of \u2018we\u2019 who must act collectively to counter the political \ndemands of \u2018them\u2019 (Gamson 1992).  One may suppose that where mainstream parties fail to \narticulate a sense of collective political subjecthood and to affirm the possibility of collective action, \ncitizens are likely either to become decreasingly politically engaged (perhaps seeking an ethnic form \nof collectivity which makes no claim on the political scene, or restricting their engagement to single-\nissue campaigns) or, as one sees frequently in contemporary European politics, to be attracted by \nthose so-called populist parties which do construct their constituencies in collective terms (as \u2018the \npeople\u2019), albeit in anti-democratic ways such that the established political system itself is positioned \nas the adversary.  Lacking suitable modes of subjecthood, democratic forms of critique become \ndifficult to articulate.  Clearly the impact of such trends is likely to be felt on politics at the national \njust as much as the EU level, but they may be especially damaging in the context of a political arena \nrequiring the formation of cross-national collective allegiances.\n11\n    \n  A further idea of importance is the thesis that contemporary European politics is \nincreasingly played out in a moral register (Mouffe 2005) or a technocratic register (Burnham 2001) \nrather than a political one.  There is a tendency, in other words, for political choices to be framed and \njustified in absolute terms (\u2018right vs wrong\u2019, \u2018sensible vs nonsensical\u2019, \u2018efficient vs inefficient\u2019) \nrather than in terms which accept the possibility of reasonable disagreement, again as in the sense of \nright vs left.\n12\n  One may think of it as a disavowal of the conditions which make partisanship \nnecessary, and it has evident consequences for the vitality of political adversarialism.  First, when \nthis way of thinking becomes prevalent amongst those with governmental authority, it may lead to \ntransfers of decision-making powers to non-majoritarian institutions, since the necessity of political \ndebate may be overlooked and political disagreement may come to seem unreasonable.\n13\n  Rather \nthan acknowledging plural and potentially conflicting conceptions of worth which must be \nadjudicated in the political process, a consensual model will prevail, supporting an institutional \nregime rather like the present EU where, formally at least, the potential for political conflict to \ninform policy-making in certain areas is quite constrained.\n14\n  Second \u2013 and perhaps even more \nsignificant, given that such institutional transfers are reversible and tend anyway to leave \nconsiderable powers in the hands of politicians \u2013 is the depoliticising effect this way of framing \npolitics may have on citizens themselves.  Technocratic policy-making tends to rely on language \n                                                 \n11\n Note that such trends may be particularly pronounced in the EU context, given the EU\u2019s reliance on rights-based \nlegislation addressed to the individual, e.g. as \u2018consumer\u2019 or \u2018patient\u2019 (Chalmers 2009). \n12\n Cultural dualisms such as \u2018moderate vs extreme\u2019 also exert a limiting effect here, implying dissenting perspectives are \ndubious simply because in relative terms they are radical. \n13\n Such transfers may be further encouraged by a separate widely-disseminated leitmotif: that narrow self-interest is the \nprincipal motivation of the \u2018political class\u2019 \u2013 cf. (Hay 2007). \n14\n Analogously to the US case described in (Th\u00e9venot, Moody and Lafaye 2000), one could expect not just that one \nevaluative register comes to prevail (most likely that of the market) but also the expectation that its relationship with \nother registers (e.g. those associated with environmentalism and citizenship) is a harmonious one.  Though such views \nmay remain contested at the margins, they nevertheless undermine one of the important bases for political contestation: \ncritique of one register by the logic of another. \n 13 \nunintelligible beyond a small circle of experts, generating mysteriousness about the logic it follows \nand the ends it serves, and dulling the critiques which might be made of it.\n15\n  Further, when political \nelites adopt these moral or technocratic modes of evaluation, they discourage other citizens from \nsensing the necessity of political engagement: those who become convinced that they are \u2018right\u2019 and \nthat all competing perspectives are either \u2018mad\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 will see little reason why they should press \na political claim in support of their views, since it will seem that history is on their side and only \npatience is required.  Politics in a moral or technocratic register tends to be coupled with a sense of \nthe inevitable, and this is likely to encourage political withdrawal.\n16\n  Times of crisis may be \nparticularly worthy of study here: on the one hand it is in such moments that orthodoxies are \nquestioned and that claims to know the right answers may be weakened, yet on the other this is when \ndeterministic arguments appealing to immovable material constraints are most fervently advanced. \n  Finally, an important influence on how politics comes to be articulated, and the extent to \nwhich adversarialism is engaged in, will be the meanings commonly attached to key concepts in the \nvocabulary of political actors.  The patterns of language usage they encounter will encourage certain \ninterpretations of the social and political world over others, in turn shaping what these actors project \nonto the wider society and the political programmes they are able to justify to citizens.  The concept \nof \u2018freedom\u2019 \u2013 central to the political language of all democracies \u2013 is an interesting case in point.  \nContemporary political philosophers distinguish between different conceptions of liberty, sometimes \ntermed liberal \u2018non-interference\u2019, communitarian \u2018self-mastery\u2019, and republican \u2018non-domination\u2019 \n(Pettit 1997).  It is generally observed that, while there have been historical settings in which each \nhas had a degree of pre-eminence, in contemporary western democracies the first of these meanings \ntends to dominate.  It is, amongst other things, a master-element in the contemporary \u2018spirit of \ncapitalism\u2019 (Boltanski and Chiapello 2006).  This is likely to have implications for the politicisation \nof an EU polity long defined by its \u2018four freedoms\u2019 (Dobson 2004).  Liberty as non-interference \nappeals to the personal freedom of the individual to proceed with his\/her affairs unimpeded as far as \npossible by external, human-imposed obstacles.  It forms the basis for constitutional rights, and is \ntherefore an important component in the self-understanding of any democratic regime; yet taken on \nits own it offers little prospect for conjuring a sense of collective political subjecthood amongst \ncitizens, and is liable to render most forms of governmental intervention initially suspect.  Those \nwho adopt this conception of liberty will then probably incline towards a minimalist understanding \nof the EU as an area of free movement rather than seek to encourage citizens to influence its political \n                                                 \n15\n Cf. the Bank of England\u2019s proposals on \u2018quantitative easing\u2019 in spring 2009, a term picked up widely in media \ncoverage of the economic crisis but hardly likely to elucidate its origins or possible remedies.  Obfuscation can of course \nbe strategic. \n16\n The moralising of political debate may also lead to a heightened concern with personal hypocrisy: whether an \nindividual is morally entitled to make a certain argument, based on their actions or other statements, may come to seem \nmore deserving of attention than the substance of the argument itself.  Thus it may be decided for example that the most \nsalient feature of a climate-change conference is the carbon footprints of the conference attendees.  The ideas-based \npolitics necessary for meaningful political conflict again becomes weakened. \n 14 \nagenda.  It is the emphasis on freedom as self-mastery or non-domination which may better invite \npoliticisation, since then collective political claims aimed at achieving such freedoms are likely to \nbetter resonate.  But insofar as the one type of usage is encountered more than its alternatives, the \nideological work required to reshape the concept\u2019s meaning rather than reproduce it will be all the \ngreater. \n  Each of these constraints on the ideational change required to politicise the EU seems \ndeserving of closer attention, together with others one might mention.\n17\n  If some of these equally \nraise questions for democracy at the national level, this should serve to remind how the experiences \nof the two are entwined.  As a fledgling polity, and one whose sustained viability requires new bonds \nof attachment to develop, the challenges facing the EU are more pronounced.  But they need not be \nseen as peculiar to the one type of polity, for they are challenges for political association more \ngenerally. \n \n \nConclusion \n \nAs several EU scholars have come to note, political adversarialism concerning the ends of policy-\nmaking is arguably a crucial part of democratic life, one that may serve not only the normatively \ndesirable purpose of giving expression to the political grievances of citizens but which may \nadditionally serve a polity-building role.  It helps to bind citizens to their political institutions, and to \ncreate bonds of principle between themselves and sub-groups of their fellow citizens.  While conflict \nover substantive ends may sometimes spill into conflict over procedures also, the chances of a full \nrejection of the polity are probably diminished if there exists the possibility to contest its policies \nrather than the necessity of accepting them wholesale.  Organised political conflict is likely to be a \nnecessary condition of any satisfactory consolidation of the EU.  Yet political conflict which fails to \nresonate beyond the confines of an institutional setting can hardly perform this role.  The activities \nof political representatives need to correspond to the inclinations of citizens more widely, not so \nmuch in the eyes of the detached political observer who charts an overlap in the preference-\nstructures of the two, but in the eyes of protagonists themselves.  Moreover, a sense of popular \ninvolvement in the political struggles played out at a European level is unlikely to emerge \nspontaneously based on a recognition of self-evident interests, but instead will need fostering by \n                                                 \n17\n Such lines of investigation may be given further contextual sensitivity by examining how language and imagery are \ndeveloped differently for different audiences, or are distributed unevenly across positions in socio-economic and \norganisational space \u2013 central concerns of pragmatic and structuralist sociology respectively.  Exploration of such \nvariations might be coupled with study of the destabilising effects of contradiction.  (For a recent study of class \nvariations, see Fligstein 2008.) \n 15 \nthose political actors which choose to exercise their capacity for reinterpreting the social and \npolitical world and to expand their political struggles to a transnational level. \n  Bringing certain sociological ideas to bear on the politicisation problematic promises to \nenrich the conceptualisation of this process.  It allows one to elaborate a perspective faithful both to \nthe inescapable element of creativity and will that characterises political action, and to the \nconstraints imposed by the actor\u2019s embeddedness in a certain ideational setting.  Further, it enables \none to conceptualise how the perspectives of ordinary citizens may relate to those of their most \npolitically-engaged peers without evoking the somewhat determinist tones of cleavage theory.  \nDrawing on empirical methods related to these approaches, one can trace how certain ideational \nfeatures in particular may undermine the extent to which politicisation takes place, and explore how \nthe variety of factors combine in the specificity of a given historical moment. \n  It may be that sociologists too can derive some benefit from this encounter with the \nconcerns of another discipline.  There is a sense in which anyone engaged in social theory is at once \ndoing political theory at the same time, since where the social theorist sketches the boundaries of \norder and contingency is where they set the limits to the exercise of political initiative.  The EU case \ngenerally is a stimulating one for sociology, as it forces a reappraisal of some of its most basic \nconcepts \u2013 \u2018society\u2019 most notably \u2013 and their conventional association with the nation-state.  The \nmatter of the EU\u2019s democratisation through politicisation has the potential to be interesting in a \nfurther way, as it raises the question whether this reappraisal can be combined with an opening to \npolitical-theoretical concerns.  For those sociological approaches most receptive to this challenge, it \noffers a context in which they may be developed and refined.  \n \n \nReferences \n \nBartolini, Stefano (2005), Restructuring Europe: Centre Formation, System Building and Political Structuring between \nthe Nation-State and the European Union (Oxford: OUP). \n--- (2006), 'Should the Union be \u2018Politicised\u2019?
