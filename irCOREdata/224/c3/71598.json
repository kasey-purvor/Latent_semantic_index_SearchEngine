Scholars such as Enteman (1993), Rose (1999), \nThrift (1997, 2002), Roberts (2002), Heelas (2002), and Power (1997) examined this \nphenomenon.  \nAs Margaret Thatcher (in the British context) encouraged managers to reclaim \nthe \u2018right to manage\u2019 from what was seen as a detrimental post-war social contract \nwith trade unions and workers, the cadre of managers and executives grew and the \nmanagerial idiom expanded in a variety of ingenious and subtle ways.  For many, \nhowever, such as Wheen (2004) or Watson (2004), the cultural subtlety of managerial \nvocabularies and practices remains indiscernible from the proliferation of what they \nterm \u2018mumbo-jumbo\u2019, \u2018gobbledygook\u2019, or \u2018psycho-babble\u2019.  In the field of \norganisation and management studies, the dominant critical interpretation is that new \nmanagerial discourses are mere \u2018fashions\u2019 and \u2018fads\u2019 (Abrahamson, 1991, Huczynski, \n1993, or Prieto, 1993). \nIn this paper, we will interpret managerialism as a more intricate and nuanced \nnexus in which the meaning of work and \u2018self\u2019 in modernity are drawn in and \ncontinuously (re)configured.  The argument is that a new logic underpins management \ntoday: to govern work mainly through subjectivity.  Productivity, profitability, \nefficiency, and effectiveness have increasingly become dependent upon a new cultural \nand political economy of subjectivity at work.  Only if human subjects intensify their \ncontribution as selves can they (as human resources) enhance the production process \nand lead the organisation to success.  The omnipresent slogan \u2018people are our most \nimportant asset\u2019 is much deeper than the episodic waxing and waning of one fashion \nor another.   Recent managerial vocabularies reveal an important transformation of the \nposition and engagement of the subject in relation to the economy, society and polity.  \nThis is not a superficial, temporary and irrelevant accumulation of managerial \nmumbo-jumbo.  On the contrary, management deploys cultural resources for \ngovernance which engage the total contents of modern subjectivity.   The historical \nconditions which make possible the expansion and dispersion of management \nmentalities are rooted in the modern sense of self.  In modernity, the subject has \nbecome its own referential axis in a new matrix of self- and world-understanding.  \nVarious avenues can be pursued to interpret the consolidation of \nmanagerialism's new logic of governance.  We focus upon what we see as two of its \nmain dimensions: the extensive and intensive mobilisation of what we term the \ntherapeutic habitus of the modern self-expressive self, associated with a specific \nhorizon which we term derecognition of finitude that marks out the onto-cosmological \nsynthesis of \u2018Atlantic\u2019 modernity at the dawn of the twenty-first century. \nThe paper, first, describes some of the current tropes of managerialism relating \ndirectly to the formulation of the \u2018self\u2019 as the centre of governing work, such as \n\u2018excellence\u2019, \u2018performativity\u2019, \u2018knowledge\u2019, \u2018creativity\u2019 and \u2018innovation\u2019, \u2018play\u2019, \u2018fun\u2019 \nand \u2018wellness\u2019 at work.  The second part investigates the apparatus of managerialism \nin its immediate, everyday concreteness, through what we term therapeutic habitus.  \nManagerialism becomes, in the latter part of the last century, the way in which the \nculture of the therapeutic (in Rieff\u2019s sense, 1966) emerges as a new modality of \ngoverning work.  Management itself thus acquires a new discursive outline: instead of \nappearing as an authoritarian instance which forces upon workers a series of \nlimitations, it now presents itself as a therapeutic formula mediating self-expression \n 4 \nby empowering individuals to work upon themselves to release their fully realised \nidentity.  The full realisation of identity, explored in the third part, is predicated upon \nthe concepts projecting \u2018human resourcefulness\u2019 as a store of unlimited potentialities.  \nWe introduce the notion of derecognition of finitude to capture the basic trend of \ncontemporary managerialism which exhorts every individual to see her\/himself as a \nunique \u2018finite infinity\u2019 who ought to seek in labour the path to find, inhabit, perform \nand activate his\/her own particular endless resourcefulness.  Managerial ideology thus \nprojects, through various therapeutic tactics, a new image of \u2018human resourcefulness\u2019 \nas an \u2018infinite sphere\u2019, with its centre everywhere and circumference nowhere (in \nEckhartian terms). \n \nI. Managerial vocabularies and the \u2018self\u2019 as an infinite resource \n \nThis section discusses management concepts in which subjectivity has become central \nto the \u2018conduct of conduct\u2019 (Foucault 1982, p.220-221) in work organisations since \nthe 1980s.  This phenomenon (known as the cultural turn in critiques of managerial \nideology) has been much debated (e.g. Anthony, 1994; Alvesson, 2002a, 2002b; \nHeelas 2002; Ray and Sayer 1999; Symon 2005; Thrift 1997, 2002; Willmott 1993).  \nOur aim is to spell out more clearly the shift through which subjectivity became the \nkey locus of governance in managerialism.  The sheer number of concepts associated \nwith the subject requires careful consideration.  We analyse the intensification of \ndemands placed upon the subject and show how new, richer, more ramified and more \ndemanding ways of involvement in work have become part of the managerial \nvernacular.   \nThe essential point about the managerial idiom is that it is conceptual, in \nKoselleck\u2019s sense (1985, 2002), rather than remaining mere faddish \u2018mumbo-jumbo\u2019 \n(Wheen 2004, Watson 2004).  In other words, it has acquired the power of \u2018concept\u2019 \nas something decisive in the formulation and contestation of new horizons of \nexpectation regarding the constitution of what counts as \u2018work\u2019 in relation to \n\u2018subjectivity\u2019 at this particular historical moment.  What do we mean concretely?  For \nexample, Berg (1995) asks in the Journal for Quality & Participation, \u201cWhat is \nexpected of us?\u201d: \n \n\u201cLong-term customer loyalty. . .  \nEmployees who are continually expanding their abilities to create desired \nresults. . .  \nEnergetic commitment to company goals. . .  \nCreativity and innovation. . .  \nExceptional teamwork.\u201d \n \nIn her view, it is only those organisations \n \n\u201cthat provide a fun, pleasant, supportive work environment [that] will have the \nedge in attracting superior people who view work as a joy and have abundant \nenergy, enthusiasm and talents to focus toward organizational goals. They will \nalso unleash all of the undiscovered innovators-in-waiting who have worked \nthere for years, with no one, including themselves, having an awareness of \nhow much more they could contribute.  \n \n 5 \nWe spend too much time at work not to have fun, while we're there; when we \nwait until we finish our work to play we run the risk of living less joyful lives \nand operating less successful companies.\u201d (Berg 1995) \n \nTerms such as \u2018continually expanding abilities\u2019, \u2018abundant energy and \nenthusiasm\u2019, \u2018undiscovered innovators-in-waiting\u2019, or \u2018fun\u2019 are now ubiquitous and \nconsolidated within managerial discourse and beyond.  What interpretive operations \nstabilised this new vocabulary? \nChronologically, we begin with the category of concepts generated, in the \nearly 1980s, by the idea that organisational culture was vital to competitive \nadvantage.  It was a move made in the name of reconstituting \u2018Western\u2019 corporations \nas reunified social and political entities with a common set of interests.  \u2018Strong \ncultures\u2019 (Deal and Kennedy 1982; Kotter and Heskett 1992) were conceived as the \nsolution for increased quality and productivity.  A unified organisational culture \nappeared as the necessary response to a period of industrial tension and unrest.  The \naim of managing culture was to recover the managerial prerogative and to marshal \norganisations around a collective identity underpinned, however, by the attributes of \nan autonomous, \u2018empowered\u2019, working subject with a \u2018reengineered\u2019 mentality of \norganisational membership.  The ingredient of the collective notion of culture was the \npowerful governmental concept that continues to frame the relationship between \npeople and organisations: commitment.  Commitment became the currency for re-\nenlisting individual subjects in a united mode of work leading to increased \nperformance manifest in \u2018excellence\u2019 and \u2018total quality\u2019 (Peters and Waterman 1982; \nWilkinson et al. 1998).   \nExcellence (alongside Total Quality Management) brought forth the process of \nwork and production around the image of an endless path, a continuous \u2018search\u2019 (in \nPeters\u2019 and Waterman\u2019s terms, 1982), for a manner of labouring which provides \nindividuals and organisations with a new horizon of \u2018self-transcendence\u2019 in the name \nof \u2018total quality\u2019.  \u201cLet us help you know where you are on your journey to \nexcellence\u201d professes BPA, a consultancy for call centre operators (BPA 2007).  Yet \nwhen Peters and Waterman published In Search of Excellence (1982) the focus fell \nsomewhat predictably upon excellence rather than search. Although many of the \ncompanies held up by the authors to be \u2018excellent\u2019 quickly ran into various financial \ndifficulties, the more interesting and longer lasting aspect of the title \u2013 the idea of an \nendless search for the \u2018holy grail\u2019 of excellence \u2013 was largely overlooked.  The \n\u2018search\u2019, however, illustrates more clearly what Thrift (2002) calls the \u2018exploratory \nmode of capitalism\u2019 and perhaps represents Peters\u2019 and Waterman\u2019s most \nrevolutionary insight.  \nTo \u2018excel\u2019 means to surpass oneself and others, to reach ahead of the actual \npresent, to rise perpetually higher for something which lies outside the realm of the \nimmediate.  \u2018Excellence\u2019 is not marginal to the constitution of what counts as the \nmeasure of work in everyday organisational practices all over the world.  In fact, it \nhas become the measure of aspirations of performance today.  What is interesting in \nthis discourse is that excellence is not primarily embodied in objects, but it is a \nprimordial moral attribute of subjects who ought to strive continuously to mobilise \nuntapped inner resources to overcome limitations in the pursuit of ever more \n\u2018excellence\u2019.  Thus it becomes not just a purpose of \u2018good work\u2019 but also a \nteleological \u2018hypergood\u2019 (Taylor 1989), a source of self-realisation and self-\nactualisation.  Brooks calls this the \u2018mighty Achievatron\u2019 functioning from the very \nearly age on the basis of,  \n 6 \n \n\u201canxious parents, child psychologists, teachers, tutors, coaches, counsellors, \ntherapists, family-centred activist groups, and social critics [that] organically \ncohere into an omnipresent network of encouragement, improvement, advice, \ntalent maximisation and capacity fulfilment.\u201d (2004, 142 ff.) \n \nBrooks emphasises however that \u201cnobody planned it. There is no central control \ndeck.\u201d (idem)  How else could pre-school centres called \u2018Little Achievers\u2019 \u2013 from \nEssex and Preston in the UK, to New Jersey and Florida in the USA \u2013 be deciphered?  \nEqually, how could we account for the image of \u2018Me PLC\u2019 promoted in the brochure \nof the careers service of a leading university in the UK?  Similarly, how are we to \nrelate to DANONE\u2019s talent management system called Odyss\u00e9e? \n \n\u201cOdyss\u00e9e is based on a trilateral \"contract\": each team manager must \nencourage his team career progression, each HR manager must follow \neveryone\u2019s project and each manager must be the main player in his own \ndevelopment.\u201d (DANONE People website, accessed June 2007) \n \nSuch moves engender a new dialectic between the labouring subject and its own sense \nof \u2018self\u2019.  This dialectic is emphatically brought to light by the new discourses of \nperformativity and performance management which have become the generic demand \nof work.  They have established a fundamental link between increased personal \nengagement with work and an effective production process.  Their practical \ntranslation is the multitude of techniques of \u2018audit\u2019 and \u2018accountability\u2019 (Power 1997): \nmanagement by objectives, agreed targets, multi-dimensional appraisals and \nperformance management systems.   \nThe subtle politics of the performance-performativity nexus lies in the \nmessage that organisations now rely largely upon performing subjects, rather than \nperforming subjects upon organisations.  The key practice is the performance \nappraisal.  Although it takes many forms, it follows a common course.  First, the \nsubject of appraisal (\u2018the appraisee\u2019) states his\/her own view of personal performance \nin a confessional stage (Townley 1994).  Secondly, an examination by the line \nmanager (as appraiser) results in a dialogue whose aim is to negotiate areas of \nimprovement and development that might be addressed through various training \nopportunities offered both as a chance to improve work results and as a prospect for \nself-improvement.  This process generates an opportunity and an obligation to self-\nexpress and self-explore, whilst simultaneously acting as a platform for continuous \naudit by the organisation.  It moves away from traditional forms of monitoring by \nembroiling the subject in the act of organisational control, coupled with the \ntherapeutic principle that outcomes must always be agreed upon.  This changes the \napproach to what traditionally was seen as the managerial prerogative of control and \nsituates it in a process of double translation. On the one hand, the organisation \ntranslates its objectives into performance targets, and, on the other, the subject \nexpresses its own specific needs and makes the organisation responsible for their \nfulfilment.  What emerges is a new mechanism of governance which makes the \nemployee the focus of a quasi-therapeutic encounter.  \u2018Performance\u2019 has also become \nthe predicate of the journey towards excellence.  It makes manifest, in discourse and \npractice, the postulate that the working subject is always capable of \u2018more\u2019, of \n\u2018becoming better\u2019, of learning, creativity, knowledge and \u2018talent\u2019 beyond that which is \ncurrently performed.   \n 7 \nAs the 1980s and 1990s progressed, the set of concepts associated with \n\u2018knowledge\u2019 was added to the vocabulary of managerial governance.  \u2018Knowledge\u2019 \nbecame the great differentiator of performance and main platform of personal and \ncollective success. As \u2018the new resource\u2019, it was embraced at all levels of government \nand governance and became the principle of the so-called \u2018new economy\u2019 in which \n\u2018information\u2019 and \u2018information technologies\u2019 appear to carry the promise and hope of \nendless resourcefulness.  Underpinning it is the expectation that the subject at work \nshould also see itself as participating in a continuous process of knowledge creation.  \nWork is presented as a space for self-expression opened up by the eagerness of \norganisations to embrace new ideas and changes, to de-routinise labour (no \norganisation wants to be seen as \u2018mainstream\u2019 anymore). The complement is the \nwillingness of the self to engage in continuous learning, development and creative \nthinking. \nYet it would be misleading to present new managerial views of human \nresourcefulness simply as more intense disciplinary matrices which require the \nconstruction of working identities around a form of askesis based upon self-\nrenunciation.  Quite the contrary, we would argue: excellence, performativity, or \nknowledge point to a very different cultural stratum.  Instead of predicating work \nupon the premise of sacrificing the integrity of the whole person, they draw around \nwork the discursive contours of liberating the entire \u2018self\u2019, releasing it from the \nerstwhile shackles of \u2018Taylorism\u2019\/\u2019Fordism\u2019 or of the \u2018Protestant Ethic\u2019. \nThis projection of personal fulfilment, liberation and endless self-realisation is \nnowhere more visible than in the new discourses of play and fun at work, as well as \nwellness, well-being and happiness at work.  Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, \norganisations began to deploy systematically ludic (play) technologies.  From training \nsessions to entire corporate culture setups, work was reconfigured through play and, \nincreasingly, work was represented as \u2018play\u2019.  This subtle yet very significant trend \nled to the expansion and intensification in the use of \u2018play\u2019 and \u2018fun\u2019 turning work \ninto a potentially \u2018total experience\u2019 of oneself in which spontaneity, eccentricity and \nimagination are the new mainstream \u2018disciplinary\u2019 formulas (analysed in three \nauthors\u2019 articles; undisclosed references).  Current references to \u2018play@work\u2019 show \nthat it has undergone a change from being a destructive and disruptive element (e.g. in \nF.W. Taylor\u2019s analysis of \u2018soldiering\u2019), or a mere \u2018recreational\u2019 complement to work \n(e.g. Deal and Kennedy 1982), to becoming a \u2018creative force\u2019, a central modality of \nbeing at work (e.g. Deal and Kennedy\u2019s new take in 1998, Pinault 2004, or Kane \n2004).  Pat Kane argues in his Play Ethic (2004) that it \u201copens up the infinite \npossibilities arising from full engagement of heart, body and soul\u201d.  He sees play as \nmore than enhancing performance: \n \n\u201c\u2026play forms have become legitimate and effective in improving business \nperformance\u2026  but is that all there is to play? Is it just a performance \nenhancer? \n \nLike spirituality, play is about a means of transcendence in the everyday - \nanother \u2018breath of life\u2019 (pneuma) that animates fixed situations, accepted \nboundaries, and puts things \u2018in play\u2019.  Like spirituality, play is about \nembracing possibility and change rather than fearing it \u2013 because play is \ngrounded in a deep common reality for humanity.\u201d (Kane 2007) \n \n 8 \nMoreover, corporations such as Google, Egg:\u00a6, or office complexes such as \nChiswick Park in London (operated by www.enjoy-work.com) invest heavily in new \narchitectural complexes which are built around the core value of work as \u2018playful\u2019 and \n\u2018fun\u2019.   \nOne further example of a management concept projecting an image of endless \nhuman resourcefulness is the new programmatic discourse of wellness, well-being and \nhappiness at work.  The predicate of such programmes (see, for example, the \nChartered Institute of Personnel and Development\u2019s volume on \u2018Wellness at Work\u2019, \n2007) is that only a complete \u2018care package\u2019 can do justice to the experience of work \nas a manifestation of the whole person.  The University of Calgary has developed its \nown Staff Wellness Centre whose programme is entitled \u2018LIVE WELL ~ WORK \nWELL\u2019 (2007).  Its \u201cvalues flow from the University's human values: \n \nRespect for the dignity of all persons \nFair and equitable treatment of individuals in our diverse community \nHighest standards of personal integrity and trustworthiness \nParticipation, collaboration, and effective teamwork \nCreativity, initiative, and risk-taking \nHonest and sensitive communication \nLearning, growth and development \nPersonal and organizational wellness and achievement.\u201d (idem) \n \nThe image is of an organisation from which all contradictions have been \nexpertly suppressed by careful management (see Roberts 2002, 17).  At GooglePlex \n(Google\u2019s new London HQ \u2013 Google 2007), healthy food is provided free throughout \nthe day, fitness facilities are available, and \u2018fun\u2019 is the umbrella of work.  Egg:\u00a6\u2019s \nheadquarters in Derby are very similar (see Egg:\u00a6 2007; and authors\u2019 undisclosed \nreference).  Combined with a playful architectural setting, the message is that work is \nnot in opposition to life, that one\u2019s working identity should not be constructed against \nwork (as subjugating or sacrificial) but through it, as an opportunity to enhance life \nwithout limitations.  Managerialism makes significant investments in what Foucault \nwould identify as the territory of \u2018biopolitics\u2019 (Foucault 1997). \nTo conclude, we wish want to emphasise the new accent of managerial \ndiscourses: that work can be seen as a sphere where all aspects of the self belong and \nare taken care of.  Thus fully formulated, subjectivity develops into the predicate of \ngovernance through which work is presented as a complete package catering for the \nwell-being of the whole person.  These concepts mark a new ethical demand: that \nwork ought to become more than just a mechanical means for life; it ought to be seen \nas a possibility of continuous self-transcendence, of excelling, through an ever more \nintense self-fulfilment.   \n \nII. The therapeutic habitus as a cultural resource for managerialism \n \nThe logic that unites these vocabularies draws its sustenance from the characteristic \nself-understanding of the modern subject.  Their consolidation is grounded in the \ndeep-seated sense of \u2018self\u2019 which lies at the core of modernity writ large.  Despite the \nfact that it appeared in an unsystematic fashion, subjectivity is the intelligible and \ncoherent nucleus of this idiom.  However, the \u2018modern self\u2019 is not an invention of \nmanagerial ideology per se.  The \u2018modern self\u2019 is not a specific formation that \ncorresponds to the regional confines of contemporary managerial discourse with its \n 9 \ndistinct historicity.  Rather, managerialism has appropriated a diverse but \ninterconnected set of essential and distinctly modern questions regarding our sense of \nself and work, of order and meaning.  \nOne way to capture this trend is the inspired metaphor of \u2018soft capitalism\u2019 used \nby Thrift (1997), Ray and Sayer (1999), and Heelas (2002).  Ray and Sayer (1999, 17) \nemphasized that organisational success has become gradually bound up with the ever \nmore intense employment of \u2018soft\u2019 characteristics of the labouring subject.  However, \nthe predicate \u2018soft\u2019 must not be confused with the implication that contemporary work \nhas become easy.  Rather, as the authors above point out, \u2018soft\u2019 denotes the \nintensification of demands on the self to become ever more involved in work.  Indeed, \nonce the subject is placed at the centre, labour becomes \u2018hard\u2019 in a new way.  This \nspecific \u2018hardship\u2019 is grounded in a new type of ethical vector.  Tipton (1984) called it \nthe \u2018ethics of self-work\u2019.  Heelas explains that this changes \u201cthe locus of authority-\ncum-value\u201d by situating it in \u201canother kind of individualisation\u201d: \n \n\u201cthe self as a self which considers itself to be something more, something \nmuch \u2018deeper\u2019, more natural and authentic than the self of what is taken to be \ninvolved with the superficialities of the \u2018merely\u2019 materialistic-cum-\nconsumeristic; the self as a self which has to work on itself to enrich and \nexplore itself in the process of dealing with its problems\u201d (2002, 80) \n \nThere is a shift both in the position of work in the life of the subject and in the \nrelationship of the subject with work as a social activity.   \nWork becomes a stage for self-expression. The historical horizon of this \ntransformation lies not only in the last two decades, but in the whole of the twentieth \ncentury which brought the concrete modality of self-work, what we term the \ntherapeutic habitus, to its full realisation.  Moreover, at the heart of contemporary \nmanagerialism lies the \u2018object\u2019 which marked the very beginning of modernity, \nnamely, the \u2018self\u2019 as subjectum.  By designating the \u2018self\u2019 as subjectum we refer here \nto that profound change in the position that the self occupies in the world, to that \ndecisive moment when \u2018man\u2019 took upon himself the responsibility for the condition of \nthe universe and posited \u2018his\u2019 own existence as that which \u2018underlies\u2019 it, that which \ngives it meaning and value.  Here, modernity means a \u201chistorical-cultural \u2018event\u2019 \nwhich changes the relationship between the universe, its transcendent horizon, and its \nhuman interpreter\u201d (Dupr\u00e9 1993, 249) and generates an original onto-cosmological \nsynthesis whose underlying principle (the subjectum) becomes the human subject \nitself.   \nThe novelty of the intensive appropriation of subjectivity by managerialism \nlies in the representation of work as a process of releasing the full potentialities of the \nself, as a locus in which self-exploration and expression are encouraged, as a place \nwhere traditional restrictive controls recede into the background.  \u2018Fordist\u2019 \nmanagement (which presupposes the repression of subjectivity in its self-expressive \nmode and its submission to a variety of externally imposed controls) is replaced by a \nnew style of engagement in which self-expression is encouraged while control is \nsituated in processes of self-examination, evaluation and reflection. In other words, \nthe site of control is also displaced to a significant extent from external authority to \ninner attributes of the subject who is urged to self-manage.  This marks a subtle twist \nin the cultural dynamic of managerial control: encouraging autonomous employees to \nuse their alleged independence to express their resourcefulness as well as to submit \nthemselves to continuous self-scrutiny and audit in the name of accountability.  Power  \n 10 \nargues that \u201cThis is the real audit society.  It is not an adversarial world of external \ninspectors \u2013 although that can still happen. It is the normalised auditable world of self-\ninspection.\u201d (2007, 16).   \nComprehensive appraisal and performance management systems, for example, \nare direct manifestations of the way in which the therapeutic has become pivotal to \nthe audit process itself.  They position \u2018manager\u2019 and \u2018managed\u2019 in a \u2018positive\u2019 \ntherapeutic context in which the former acts as quasi-therapist filling in a \u2018case \nhistory\u2019 and deciding, together with the latter as involved \u2018patient\u2019, a course of future \ntreatment through the rubric of the \u2018Personal Development Plan\u2019.  Indeed, the \nmanager is not exempt from her\/his own appraisal: 360\u00b0 Degree Appraisals expose \neverybody to comprehensive scrutiny.   \nThe managerial tactics explored bring the therapeutic into the domain of \nlabour.  This can be seen, for instance, in the mechanism through which production \nand productivity are transformed into acts of \u2018performance\u2019 and \u2018performativity\u2019.  \nEqually illustrative is the new combination of the work effort with the tropes of \nwellness and well-being. Managerialism consolidates through the expansion of \nvarious therapeutic techniques and mentalities that now straddle both the sphere of \nproduction and that of consumption in a multiple array of self-help practices.  In \nRose\u2019s words: \n \n[The] \u201cTherapeutic [appears], rather, in the sense that the relation to oneself is \nitself folded in therapeutic terms \u2013 problematising oneself according to the \nvalues of normality and pathology, diagnosing one\u2019s pleasures and \nmisfortunes in psy terms, seeking to rectify or improve one\u2019s quotidian \nexistence through intervening upon an \u2018inner world\u2019 we have enfolded as both \nso fundamental to our existence as humans and yet so close to the surface of \nour experience of the everyday.\u201d (1998, 192) \n \nPresenting work as a sequence of opportunities for self-expression, \nmanagerialism transforms self-expression into a predicate of organisational and self-\ndiscipline, without needing to make recourse to traditional authoritarian vocabularies \nof control which fade into the background leaving room for the expansion of \n\u2018positive\u2019, \u2018developmental\u2019 technologies of audit.   \nThe apparatus of soft capitalism acquires its immediate, everyday concreteness \nthrough the therapeutic habitus.  This must be qualified albeit briefly.  We use it in \nthe sense associated with Thomas Aquinas\u2019 Summa Theologiae (IaeIIae q. 22-48; 49-\n54): \u2018habitus\u2019 is the way in which human nature acquires the perfection of the \u2018soul\u2019 \nby balancing the relationships between \u2018passions\u2019 (desires or sensibilities, as \nTocqueville put it, \u2018habits of the heart\u2019) and \u2018reason\u2019 in the name of making every \nhuman act \u2018virtuous\u2019.  This notion reveals the fundamental historical link between the \nculture of \u2018virtue\u2019 and that of the \u2018therapeutic\u2019 in the European tradition: virtue comes \nout, ever since the Hellenistic age, from the proper examination and \u2018care of the soul\u2019 \n(Patocka 2002, 91-92; Foucault 2005).  In Christianity, self-exploration in prayer and \nconfession are the specific practical modalities through which the individual does \ntherapeia as the act of \u2018doing service to the god\u2019 (Liddell 1966).  Indeed, the \nrelationship between a proper \u2018habitus\u2019 and the continuous self-examination and care \nfor the soul is uninterrupted in European cultural history.  Aquinas\u2019 conception is, of \ncourse, based upon a given theological interpretation; however, taking a leap forward \nto the latter part of the twentieth century, the secularisation of late modernity makes \nthe human \u2018self\u2019 in its ordinary, everyday life, the ultimate underlying principle of \n 11 \nworld order, whose continuous preoccupation with itself grounds the modern version \nof what Foucault called the \u2018care of the self\u2019 as an individuated and self-referential \nentity.  The modern \u2018ordinary\u2019 self (Taylor 1989) becomes, in the twentieth century, \nthe secularised locus and object of the \u2018therapeutic habitus\u2019 mediating the search for \nself-perfection. \nWe propose this notion here not as a conceptual advancement, but merely as a \nfootnote to the literatures on both the \u2018therapeutic\u2019 (Rieff 1966; Foucault 1967; Rose \n1999; Patocka 2002; Furedi 2004) and \u2018habitus\u2019 (from Aristotle\u2019s hexis and Aquinas\u2019s \nhabitus, to elaborations in Schiller and Kierkegaard, as well as Mauss 1973 and \nBourdieu 1977).  Its use is metaphorical; it aims to capture the underlying character of \nthe mentality of self-perfection invoked by managerialism, a mentality best \nrepresented by Rieff\u2019s image of the therapeutic\u2019s \u2018triumph\u2019 (1966).  The reference to \nAquinas associates it more directly to the sphere of what might be termed the \u2018modern \nsoul\u2019.  This accent moves it away, in this specific context, from the meaning \u2018habitus\u2019 \nfinds, for instance, in Mauss (1973, 73) and which consigns it more to the body.  The \ntherapeutic habitus, in our sense, is not to be read in the Maussian key as a routine, or \n\u2018technique\u2019, of the body, but in a more existential, Heideggerian key, as a mode of \nprojection in which specific orientations towards the future, specific \u2018horizons of \nexpectation\u2019 (Koselleck, 2002) manifest themselves \u2018habitually\u2019 and not simply \nroutinely.  Thus \u2018habitus\u2019 indicates here the complex ideatic horizon through which \nhuman beings project concretely their potentialities but not merely in the static \nmanner of durable routines for maintenance, but as dynamic articulations through \nwhich, in the widest sense, the human sees itself with oneself and with others in the \nworld. \nA crucial feature (which cannot be overlooked) of the politics of the \ntherapeutic habitus in managerialism is that its practices do not discriminate between \nhierarchical levels.  Indeed, the entire organisational body politic undergoes many of \nthese treatments.  Furthermore, the more intense and more expensive they are, the \nmore likely it is that the subjects will be the managerial cadre rather than shopfloor \nranks.  The political economy of managing subjectivity no longer displays simplistic \nclass divisions of labour.  Organisational cultures are the devices supposed to \nintegrate the subject into a communal symbolic system.  They are paradoxical \nattempts to offer simultaneously a kind of both \u2018positive\u2019 and \u2018negative\u2019 community \ncure (in Rieff\u2019s sense, 1966, 73) by drawing firm ethical boundaries for individuals to \norganise their experiences as a communal process, yet at the same time offering \nculture as a boundless, completely open social space for self-expression and self-\ncentredness. \nThe power of the therapeutic lies in this complex positioning of individual and \ncollective subjects.  As the \u2018self\u2019 is placed at the centre of the relationship, it is more \neasily captured by practices of self-improvement, self-development, or self-\nmanagement which have become leitmotifs of organisational life.  The therapeutic \nbrings the self close to itself, it creates a space in which it is the focus.  It allows \nindividual differentiation as well as the establishment of a personalised rapport \nbetween employee and employer.  In addition, it projects the self as an always \ninsufficiently utilised resource whose full potential risks remaining concealed unless it \nis helped to surface through the mediation of experts.  The subject thus must take the \nopportunity to be available and visible to expert scrutiny in the name of improving \nitself, of accessing its purportedly limitless powers of self-realisation.  The therapeutic \nrelationship thus appeals to the ethic of self-work through a promise of discovering a \n\u2018better self\u2019, or a better way of being oneself.  An example are the recent attempts to \n 12 \ninclude \u2018wellness\u2019 and \u2018happiness\u2019 as elements of the cultural contract of work.  \nProgrammes of \u2018wellness at work\u2019 set up a metaphor of a nearly clinical nature that \nopens up a new avenue for profiling the relationship between one\u2019s work life and the \nrest of personal existence.   \nThe hope of finding unknown potentialities in oneself marks the therapeutic \ncontext as a crucial ingredient in the creation of a new subject position: namely, that \nwork provides the opportunity to enhance personal value, to realise previously latent \ncapabilities in the service of self-affirmation and self-realisation.  As Bellah et al. \n(1985, 123) argued, \u201cmuch of our work is a form of therapy.\u201d   Work turned into a \nsubject-centred therapeutic process makes possible new forms of self-governance by \nformulating positive, constructive ideals which link organisational success with \npersonal achievement through self-expression.   \nContemporary organisations become a successful normative framework \nbecause they mobilise to a large extent this \u2018therapeutic habitus\u2019 in the forms \ndiscussed.  Work is predicated upon the premise that it has become a place of release \nfrom the renunciatory ethos of self-abnegation (clear in the Protestant ethic).  \nManagement\u2019s invocation of the self and subjectivity (as objects to be cultivated, \ndeveloped, and enhanced by releasing their full \u2018human resourcefulness\u2019) has made \nwork into an order of therapy sui generis. The practices described above deploy the \narsenal of the therapeutic as a manifestation of the wider context of modern culture \nwhose canon is the liberation and emancipation of the \u2018Self\u2019. \n \nIII.  Is human resourcefulness infinite?  Managerialism, subjectivity and the \n\u2018derecognition of finitude\u2019  \n \nThe self as subject connects managerialism with the a priori historical ground of \nmodernity.  As a cultural phenomenon, it can only be elucidated through this \nfundamental historical dimension.  Therefore the interpretive horizon which opens up \nis much broader suggesting wider implications of managerial discourse and practice. \nThe emergence of the modern cultural synthesis transformed the way in which \nwe interpret and value the labouring activity as such. Labour now stands as the \nconstituting factor of human existence.  In order to locate the origins of this \ntransformation we need to grasp the significance of the profound disintegration of the \npre-modern sense of world-order.  Modernity dissolved the certainties by which the \nworld appeared as a pre-ordered, supreme \u2018cosmos\u2019, governed by an omnipotent \n\u2018Creator\u2019 and guardian, in which the human occupied a contemplative, predetermined \nplace.  As a consequence of the dissolution of the geocentric world-view, the world \nbecomes an \u2018infinite universe\u2019 (Koyr\u00e9 1968), a place where humanity is now isolated \nand where survival can only come from an active engagement with life itself \n(Blumenberg 1985).  The modern \u2018self\u2019 emerges in this order as the sole point of \nreference.  It is thus faced with the only alternative for survival: self-assertion through \nlabour.  Nature itself becomes a store of resources for the production of the species\u2019 \nconcrete, everyday existence.  Thus, despite the loss of previous certainties in an \n\u2018enchanted world\u2019, the threshold of modernity sees the transformation of \u2018man\u2019 into \nan individualised self, an autonomous, assertive subject, with an unprecedented \nfreedom and a horizon of endless possibilities.  The \u2018self\u2019 as subject became a cultural \nreality; this is the birth of Descartes\u2019 ego, of the vita activa, and of Homo faber \n(Arendt 1958, 273-280, 153 ff.; Bergson 1960).  Though seemingly enabled by this \ncultural liberation from Medieval dogmatism, the individual ego stands alone in the \ninfinite universe.  It has to labour (materially and ideatically) to construct its everyday \n 13 \nexistence without recourse to the traditional reference points (divinity and ordered \ncreation).  Human life becomes a project whose realisation presupposes that the \nsubject becomes self-expressive as well as self-making (in other words, seeking \ncontinuously to fill its life with some form of meaning).   \nThe human being is henceforth converted into the locus of a new system of \npolitical ordering and governance.  What followed was the designation of new \n\u2018places\u2019 (topoi) where true humanity manifests itself.  A new essence of sociality was \nconstituted, together with new institutions, and a new purpose of governance ensued.  \nThis happened because, evidently, previous institutions (such as the polis of the \nGreeks, the civitas of the Romans, the ecclesia of the Christians) could no longer \nprovide a meaningful and articulate framework for governing human self-expression. \nThe appropriate site for self-expression is labour itself and the work-organisation with \nthe subject at its centre. \nThus, managerialism operates with a model of identity revolving around the \nnotion of Homo faber (Arendt 1958, 153 ff.).  The human subject appears as the \nmeasure of all things in the activity of fabrication.  The role of work is to give form to \nthe search for a source of meaning and value.  Within the modern process of \nsecularisation this search acquires a new temporality.  A reoccupation occurs of the \nposition of \u2018higher time\u2019 (the time of periodic liturgical connection with the divine, or \nthe \u2018liturgy of leisure\u2019 as that authentic private sphere where the real, unalienated self \nsupposedly manifests) by \u2018ordinary time\u2019, the urgent time of self-realisation here and \nnow, every day and everywhere.  This ordinary time characterises the life of Thrift\u2019s \n\u2018fast subject\u2019 (2002) who is perpetually seeking \u2018material\u2019 to construct its identity as a \n\u2018success\u2019. \nThus, life itself (the project of the human subject) becomes a secularised \njourney towards \u2018perfection\u2019.  The modern self, circumscribed by worldly time, sees \nitself as a unique \u2018finite infinity\u2019 to be actualised.  In an endless cycle of activities of \nproduction and consumption, the modern self seeks to fill the vacuum at its core by \ngenerating its own substance through practices of self-work and the therapeutic \nculture which purports to offer endless possibilities. Nietzsche (1983) called it \n\u201cmodern man\u2019s small soul\u201d. As Dupr\u00e9 argues: \n \n\u201cIn the course of assuming control over everything else the self, as \nKierkegaard put it, lost sight of its own identity.  Separated from that totality \nwhich once nurtured it and largely deprived of the interiority which once \ndefined it, it has become an indigent self.\u201d (1993, 119) \n \nBut this perpetual search is represented as a release of endless potentialities \nwithin.  In other words, life is conceived as an endless project through which the \u2018self\u2019 \nseeks permanent and unlimited fulfilment.  Management expresses this search in the \ncurrent phase of modernity. \nLiberated from dogmatic shackles, the foundational question of this novel \nworld-view is how the \u2018self\u2019 is to carry the burden of absolute freedom.  Certain \ntransformations occur in the function, meaning and applications of particular \nmetaphors, such as self-actualisation, self-realisation, performance, excellence, total \nquality, knowledge, or talent.  The problem of absolute freedom and the problem of \nfinitude become problems of measure in both ethical and epistemological terms.  The \nprojection of endless potentialities of the self in the exercise of this newly found \nfreedom is perpetually in search of a measure: if the self always possesses something \nin \u2018excess\u2019 of what it already is, what is the normative framework, or conceptual \n 14 \nspecification, that makes this \u2018surplus\u2019 accessible?  Excess of potentiality is a \nparadoxical notion: it is not a \u2018beyond\u2019 but always something immanent and somehow \naccessible whilst remaining always an aspiration.  Without a measure (a \n\u2018hypermetron\u2019) of the journey to actualise potentialities, the invocation of excellence, \ntotal quality, or continuous improvement is always running the risk of being fraught \nwith the sense of \u2018being out of reach\u2019.  The formulation of such a \u2018hypermetron\u2019 has \nbecome the object of the \u2018audit society\u2019(Power 1997).  Its constant multiplication \nbetrays the fact that contemporary management practices, focusing upon the \nmobilisation of human resourcefulness as that which is always in excess of what it \ncurrently is, cannot solve the problem that excess is a pseudo-measure, which refuses \nto be evaluated and to be measured: \u201cThe overflow is not mere abundance of too \nmuch quantity but self-withdrawing of all estimation and measuring\u201d (Heidegger, \n1999, 176). And yet even though it cannot solve the very problem it sets out for itself, \nthe \u2018audit society\u2019 has become a binding normative framework for contemporary \nwork. It has become a hegemony facing us with perpetual exhortations to overcome \nour current limits. \nOvercoming finitude is used here in this specific way: as an iterative process, a \nrepetition of acts of self-reengineering with the potential that they allow \u2018endless \nprogress\u2019, an endless actualisation of potentialities.  Overcoming finitude is not a \ncultural motif which anticipates an end of this process; there is no eschaton to be \nawaited, no last judgement to be faced.  It is not a case that, one day, the \u2018I\u2019 will have \nbecome, finally, \u2018totally excellent\u2019.  Thus, to put it more systematically, the \novercoming of finitude does not mean, first, a positive affirmation of the \n(quantitative) infinitude of the human as an animal species.  Nor does it, secondly, \nmean a denial of finitude as such.  On the contrary, as Foucault suggests (1994, 312-\n318), \u2018Enlightenment science\u2019 operated precisely in the key of a finite empiricity.   \nModernity does not posit the endlessness of the world either. Quite the contrary: the \nfinitude of the \u2018world\u2019 (as a standing-reserve) is manifest in the recognition of \necological limits.  Thirdly, overcoming finitude is not even a tragic gesture of turning \naway from the mortal nature of man.  In fact, what characterises our culture is not a \nsense of hopelessness, or a tragic feeling of \u2018fear and trembling\u2019 (to paraphrase \nKierkegaard), generated by the recognition of our predicaments \u2013 i.e. it is not a tragic \nrealisation of the limits of modern culture in its current environment.  Modernity is \nnot giving up hope; rather it sees its crises as opportunities.   \nThe fundamental dimension of finitude we are emphasising here is not in fact \nan \u2018overcoming\u2019 at all.  The specific meaning of the modern engagement with finitude \nis, in our view, its articulation as an act of derecognition.  Hence, we propose that the \ndistinct mentality which articulates managerial vocabularies is what we term \n\u2018derecognition of finitude\u2019.  In this sense, derecognising finitude implies, first, a \nspecific form of secularisation.  Modernity (in its latest phase) no longer questions \nhuman finitude in terms of what comes after death, in terms which imply a \ntranscendent horizon.  In modernity, the \u2018transcendent\u2019 actually disappears as a mode \nof problematisation in the context of the \u201caffirmation of ordinary life\u201d (Taylor 1989, \n211-305).  The secular modern self does not simply reoccupy the position of \ntranscendent source.  Although the ordinary self is situated at the centre of its own \nuniverse, it is not projecting itself as a literal divinity. What we are witnessing is not \njust a degradation of transcendence (as L\u00f6with 1949 would), but rather that \ntranscendence is no longer really a source of reference for the modern synthesis \nregardless of how much we speak of the \u2018spiritual\u2019 or of various relics of divinity. \n 15 \nThus, the second sense in which we specify the notion of derecognition refers \nprecisely to the \u2018economic\u2019 as the idealised form of the worldly modern social order, \nfrom which we witness a removal of vocabularies of finitude, limits, or the \u2018tragic\u2019 in \nhuman life as a central preoccupation of \u2018existential man\u2019.  The \u2018economy\u2019 is no \nlonger conceptualised in terms of the traditional question of limits and scarcity, but \nrather as a new image of the \u2018world\u2019 where infinitude is immanent in the finite.  At the \ndawn of the 21st century, the economy has acquired its full cultural force as an \nidealised formula for a social order in which the overcoming of finitude is finally \npossible.  The political economy of neo-liberalism, the hope invested in the \n\u2018knowledge economy\u2019, as well as in \u2018information technologies\u2019, ideas of endless \n\u2018human resourcefulness\u2019 (as exemplified above) are all concrete manifestations of this \nmajor act of derecognition. \nFinally, the most important dimension of what we term derecognition of \nfinitude is a positive affirmation of the worldly overcoming of limits, an \nintensification of the enjoyment of life in the immediacy of the everyday and with the \nurgency of permanent positivity.  This search for self-affirmation has developed its \nown practical apparatus.  The specific expression of this apparatus is that of various \ntherapeutic technologies encountered in both production and consumption spheres.  \nThey replace former practices of self-abnegation, sacrifice, or limitation, in the name \nof an endless cycle of self-improvement, development and Maslowian actualisation \nthrough acts of self-examination, knowledge and expression. \nHomo faber, the instrumentaliser, becomes an end in itself and everything else \nin the world looses its intrinsic value. The mentality of fabrication means that are no \nlonger standards of self-regulation and that there is no stopping the tendency towards \nlimitless instrumentalisation of everything that exists. The attribute of infinity \nbecomes immanent in subjectivity itself because there is no transcendent realm that \ngoverns the ends\/means mentality of Homo faber.  What we have been trying to argue \nis that managerialism has assembled over the last couple of decades a growing \nvocabulary for ordering work which operates in this horizon of derecognising \nfinitude. \n \nConclusions \n \nThis paper examined the conceptual-cultural moves which link managerialism (as it \nbecame configure over the last two decades or so) to the deeper cultural processes \nwhich characterise the synthesis we call \u2018modernity\u2019.  What we aimed to show is that \nthe former has reconstructed itself towards the end of the 20th century through a \ncomplete turn to subjectivity as a central locus for ordering work.   \nThis rearticulation occurred through the proliferation of various vocabularies \nand practices revolving around the \u2018self\u2019 which have led to a shift in the equation of \nlabour.  Work, as action by a working subject upon an object of work, undergoes in \nWestern production systems a silent but fundamental conversion.  The human subject \nis converted into the main object of the governance of production in general.  The \ntraditional source of identity in work \u2013 as work upon a particular \u2018object\u2019 \u2013 has \nchanged accordingly.  By being exhorted to continuously work upon her\/his \u2018self\u2019, \nupon her\/his subjectivity, these new discourses position the labourer in a new relation \nto work.  The new dialectic of labour consists of continuous acts of self-\nunderstanding, self-examination and \u2018self-work\u2019.  The outcome is a process in which \nthe \u2018self qua self\u2019 becomes the object of daily work mediated by a plethora of \ntherapeutic technologies.   \n 16 \nManagerialism articulates a new kind of collective and personal ethos in Euro-\nAtlantic organisations and beyond at the dawn of the twenty-first century.  The \nessence of this ethos is two-fold.  On the one hand, human subjectivity becomes the \ncentral resource of production to the extent that people participate in this process in a \nperpetual search to mobilise their inner resourcefulness.  On the other hand, work \noffers endless possibilities to search for \u2018self-actualisation\u2019 as main source of both \npersonal and organisational \u2018excellence\u2019 and \u2018performance\u2019.  The experience of work \nis no longer mere toil, sacrifice and expenditure of the \u2018self\u2019.  \u2018Excellence\u2019, \n\u2018performativity\u2019, \u2018total quality\u2019 and so on aim to create a framework in which the \nambitions of managerialism are no more nor less than to resolve the historical \ncontradictions of labour: between labour as the exercise of thought and reason, and \nthe expression of \u2018desire\u2019, emotion and sensibility; between the fullest expressions of \nindividuality and communal (collective) belonging; between the autonomy of human \nagency and its determination as an organic body which has to be kept \u2018well\u2019, \u2018healthy\u2019 \nand \u2018fit\u2019; and between the finitude of one concrete individual and the infinite universe \nof which it is a reflection and a carrier.   \nWhat we propose is that, in doing so, management is not simply reaching \nopportunistically for a series of \u2018pop-cultural\u2019 motifs, but that it draws on the central \nthemes which fuel modernity itself: the centrality of the self, expressive individualism \nframed in endless horizons of self-affirmation, the centrality of ordinary life as the \nultimate source of meaning and reality of the self, and the cultural centrality of the \n\u2018economy\u2019.  The key cultural process signalled here is what we term the \n\u2018derecognition of finitude\u2019.  This category is used both to describe and analyse the \nways in which certain vocabularies of management have become consolidated.  These \nvocabularies (re)present work as an opportunity to fulfil the main promise of modern \nsocial order: to secure the basis of individual autonomy and freedom, predicated on \nthe premise of the subject\u2019s full engagement in the process of self-making.  In this \nprocess, management itself acquired a new outline as therapeutic formula mediating \nself-expression by empowering individuals to work upon themselves to release their \nfully realised identity. \nBut can this fundamental tension inherent in the character of modernity \nreceive an answer from a discursive formation such as managerialism?  Can the latter, \nby removing vocabularies of finitude, of limits, or of the \u2018tragic\u2019 (as self-renunciation) \nin labour, put itself forward as a positive affirmation of the worldly overcoming of \nlimits?  Can management ideology truly rearticulate labour as an endless opportunity \nto enjoy and express life within the realm of everyday practices?  Can management \nreconstruct itself as a genuine form of therapy? \nManagerialism requires the attention of scholars because it reconstructs work \nand the identity of the labouring subject in a new horizon.  Loosing sight of this subtle \ncultural process can undermine our ability to grasp the full force of new forms of \nordering work in relation to modern identities.  One of the interesting dimensions of \nthe history of management discourse is that it seems to have ignored, most of the time, \nthe logic and dynamic of modernity: self-affirmation.  In other words, the typical \nTaylorist and Fordist preoccupation with controlling labour by limiting the spaces for \nself-release is replaced at the end of the twentieth century by an affirmation of self-\nexpression as the horizon of human resourcefulness.  Perhaps it is only in this late \naffirmation of subjectivity by management that it, finally, connects with a potential \nsource of historical legitimation.  Since the 1980s, management seems to have finally \nbecome synchronised with the culture of modernity that centres around the \naffirmation of the human subject.  Management has perhaps \u2018caught up\u2019 with \n 17 \nmodernity and become aligned with the entrenched modern understanding of social \norder which gives unprecedented primacy to the \u2018individual\u2019.  What critiques have \noverlooked in contemporary management discourses and practices is that they cannot \nbe easily dismissed as mere ruses to perpetuate self-denial in the age of emancipation.  \nWhat would, anyway, be the category of reference needed to establish why \u2018wellness \nat work\u2019 or \u2018excellence\u2019 are \u2018bad\u2019 for you, or, in a real sense, alienating?  Or, indeed, \nwhy work in general might be \u2018bad\u2019 for you? So the affirmation of subjectivity by \nmanagement can be seen as the discursive act through which it constructs not just the \nidentity of subjects but its very own legitimation.   \nBy affirming production, labour and the entitlement to self-realisation, \nmanagerialism seizes upon the core values of modernity and becomes a complex \nmechanism of signification, legitimation and domination.  Therefore, an important \ndimension of social research opens up in relation to management as a modality of \ngovernance.  The relationships between a self-centred culture and the forms of \ninstitutional order it creates, and lives with, will become increasingly important.  The \n(re)presentation of work as the building up of the \u2018self\u2019 raises fundamental questions \nabout our affiliations with economic, political and cultural institutions.   \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAbrahamson, E. 1991.  \u2018Managerial fads and fashions: the diffusion and rejection of \ninnovations\u2019, in Academy of Management Review, 16, 586-612. \n \nAlvesson, M. 2002a.
