Herz: realism and the \nfragility of the international order\nP E T E R  S T I R K *\nAbstract. John H. Herz is a significant, but comparatively neglected, figure in the development\nof International Relations (IR) as a discipline. Although he contributed to the emergence of\nrealism as the dominant approach to international relations in the United States, his thought\nis characterised by an insight into the fragility of the international order and the state which\nstands in marked contrast to the emphasis upon durability and persistence evident in recent\nsurveys of a self-avowed American realism.\nThere has been a welcome increase in the discrimination with which the develop-\nment of ideas about international order and disorder have been treated. We now\nhave long-range surveys of political theories of international relations, accounts of\nthe prewar origins of American ideas about the international order, and accounts of\nthe vicissitudes of international law.1 The neat but deceptive narratives of the clash\nof paradigms has come under sustained criticism.2 There has been increased interest\nin the non-Anglo-Saxon sources of IR theory, though this is still comparatively\nundeveloped, save for the case of Hans Morgenthau and Carl Schmitt.3 One figure\nwho has escaped much attention is John Herz, though like Morgenthau he was an\nexile from Germany who played a significant role in the development of IR theory in\nthe postwar United States. His model of the security dilemma is regularly cited in\ntextbooks and his work is still invoked as an archetypal and pioneering expression of\nclassical realism.4\nRevisiting a significant but comparatively neglected figure in the development of\nIR theory is worthwhile in its own right, especially since the full range of his work is\nless well known than International Politics in the Atomic Age and Political Realism\nand Political Idealism. Indeed Herz\u2019s first book was a pioneering assessment of Nazi\ninternational law, written under the pseudonym of Eduard Bristler in order to\nprotect his family in Germany.5 There is, however, a much more important reason\nfor reconsidering Herz. In a recent Forum in the Review of International Studies\nRichard Little has compared modern American realist doctrines, the English School\nand the classical realism of Hans Morgenthau, arguing for strong similarities between\nthe latter two, including a much greater sense of the fragility of the structure of the\ninternational order taken to lie at the heart of the realist vision.6 Others have taken a\nless charitable view of Morgenthau, seeing him, along with George F. Kennan, as\nstrikingly indifferent to the epochal significance of the Holocaust and have seen this\nas a major failure to live up to the realist claim to be responding to the unprecedented\nand violent phenomena of international life.7 Behind both sets of arguments lies a\ncommon sense that at least certain kinds of realism too readily presume as unproble-\nmatic what stands in need of explanation, even when faced with dramatic challenges\nto our understanding of the order and norms of international life.\nAny discussion of realism as a theory is bound to be faced with the problem that\nthere are now so many different \u2018realisms\u2019. Alongside the arguably predominant\ncontrast between \u2018offensive\u2019 and \u2018defensive\u2019 realism, there are self-professed \u2018neo-\nclassical\u2019 realists, \u2018contingent\u2019 realists, \u2018specific\u2019 realists and \u2018generalist\u2019 realists.8 The\nsheer diversity of realism and the adaptations that have been made to realism have\nled some to question how much of this work still counts as realism, while others\nhave entered a plea to \u2018add up what we all have in common\u2019, and some have stressed\nthe virtues of debate within particular paradigms.9 It will clearly not be possible here\nto indicate Herz\u2019s position with respect to all of these \u2018realisms\u2019. It is possible and\nnecessary to indicate how Herz\u2019s ideas relate to the contrasting assumptions and\n286 Peter Stirk\n4 See Robert O.

Differences within the realist\ncamp do matter and matter a great deal. As will be shown below, however, it is an\nawareness of the fragility of the international order and the challenges to it that\nultimately marks out Herz\u2019s brand of realism. As has been said of E.H. Carr, Herz\nwas someone \u2018who asked how that order had come about, how it had changed over\ntime, and ultimately how it might be transcended\u2019, but his optimism about the latter\npossibility was never more than guarded, kept in check by the persistence of the\nsecurity dilemma for which he became famous.10\nIt is no accident that he chose as the title of his autobiography Vom \u00dcberleben (Of\nSurvival).11 There is, of course, a simple biographical logic to that choice. As a\nGerman Jew born in 1908 his own personal survival had been under threat. Yet it\nalso reflects other factors. Herz\u2019s intellectual concerns were shaped by the short\ntwentieth century in which survival for individuals, states and the species was\nconstantly threatened. Furthermore, although Herz made his name as an advocate\nof realism within American political science, the European origins of his ideas\ncontinued to affect the way he understood key concepts and his underlying approach\nto the international order. There was a resonance of a clash of cultures in a review\nof the state of the discipline in the early 1970s. There Herz expressed his reservations\nabout quantitative approaches to international politics and recalled a seminar in the\n1930s attended by Quincy Wright \u2018where his chiefly European students, although\ngreatly impressed by his data, were flabbergasted by the unsophisticated use of\nhistorical and cultural variables\u2019.12 Nor need the difference assume such stark form.\nAs Richard Little has pointed out there is a certain kind of realism, prominent in\nAmerican IR, that assumes \u2018that anarchy is a robust structure that does not need to\nbe explained\u2019.13 Here, Herz\u2019s position is not straightforward. Herz had contributed\nto the formation of key elements of this kind of realism, notably through the idea of\nthe \u2018security dilemma\u2019, but, towards the end of his career, came to believe that \u2018we\n\u201crealists\u201d\u2019 had overlooked the contingency of the balance of power.14 Moreover, as\nwill be shown below, his realism of the 1940s and 1950s was marked by a sense of\nnostalgia for a balance of power now rendered obsolete by bipolarity and, more\nimportantly, by the atomic age. It is striking here that although Herz asserted the\ncompatibility of his approach with that of Waltz, the two theorists came to radically\ndifferent judgements about the virtues of the bipolar world. Whereas Waltz saw\nenhanced predictability, Herz saw enhanced uncertainty.15 When Herz came to\nbelieve that \u2018we \u201crealists\u201d\u2019 had been wrong it was in underestimating the precarious-\nJohn Herz and international order 287\n10 Michael Cox, \u2018Introduction\u2019, in E.H.

Murphy: \u2018Prior to the last few years the only notable figure\nin American security studies who raised serious questions about the state was John Herz\u2019. \u2018The\nSovereign State as Political-Territorial Ideal\u2019, in Thomas J. Biersteker and Cynthia Weber (eds.), State\nSovereignty as Social Construct (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 118.\n12 John H.

Waltz, Theory of International Politics (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1979), pp. 168\u201370.\nReferences to Herz\u2019s judgement are given below.\nness and violence of a previous age not the present one.16 Yet Herz did share with\nWaltz the idea the states sought security. Mearesheimer\u2019s assertion that the doctrine\nof offensive realism can be read out of Herz\u2019s view of the security dilemma\nsystematically misrepresents Herz\u2019s view of the security dilemma and the policy\nrecommendations he drew from it.17\nThat sense of precariousness was also evident in Herz\u2019s estimation of the\nnormative dimension of the international order. From the perspective of the early\n1980s Herz aligned his realism with that of Morgenthau and Kennan against the\n\u2018\u201clegalism\u201d and \u201cmoralism\u201d, wishful thinking which, in the 1920s and 1930s, and\nespecially in the United States, had passed for study of international relations\u2019.18\nThis would seem to align him also with that form of \u2018American realism\u2019 that\ncontends that \u2018norms are at best marginal in relations among states\u2019.19 Again this\nwould be a partial, and ultimately misleading judgement. Herz, a self-avowed\nrelativist, had been a pupil of Kelsen and, for all his subsequent criticism of the\ntheory of pure law, retained an interest in the normative dimension of the inter-\nnational order. It was, however, a fragile order, contingent upon the behaviour of\nstates, threatened by global trends, but nevertheless of importance. Herz, like\nMorgenthau, cannot be seen as a straightforward antecedent of contemporary\nAmerican realism. His stress on the fragility and uncertainty of the international\norder fits ill with the assumptions about the durability and predictability of the\ninternational order evident in much of contemporary American realism. Insofar as\nthe latter lays claim to Herz as part of a long-standing and deep-rooted realist\ntradition, it may be missing Herz\u2019s most perceptive insights.\nFrom K\u00f6ln to Geneva and America\nHans Kelsen and the pure theory of law\nIt was Kelsen\u2019s apparent solution to the problem of ethical relativism that first\nattracted Herz. In his autobiography Herz recalled that Kelsen seemed to offer a way\nout from the confusion of competing justifications of the state. He provided a way\nof dealing with the law and the state as a \u2018personified legal order\u2019 which brought\n\u2018clarity to the age-old problem of the relationship between law and ethics\u2019.20 Yet,\n288 Peter Stirk\n16 John H.

I return to this point below.\n18 John H. Herz, \u2018Political Realism Revisited\u2019, International Studies Quarterly, 25 (1981), p. 183.\n19 Michael C Dresch, \u2018It is Kind to be Cruel: The Humanity of American Realism\u2019, Review of\nInternational Studies, 29 (2003), p. 417.\n20 Herz, Vom \u00dcberleben, p. 96.\nfrom the outset Herz maintained a certain independence from Kelsen. Amongst the\nfactors that may have contributed to that autonomy was Herz\u2019s choice of dissert-\nation topic, namely the question of the identity of the state in cases of revolution\nand territorial change. From the outset it was the fragility of the legal order that\ninterested him.21\nIn further essays in the 1930s Herz continued to question Kelsen\u2019s theory and to\ntry to break down some of the sharp distinctions drawn within the pure theory of\nlaw. Thus, he turned to the ontology of Nicolai Hartmann in an attempt to work out\nhow one ought to understand what he called the \u2018lesser ideality\u2019 of law, that is how,\non the one hand, its normative character sets it apart from empirical reality and, on\nthe other, the fact that legal norms do not have the same kind of validity as\nmathematical or logical truths. According to Herz the answer lay in recognising that\nwhile the legal norm claimed objective validity, like a work of art it has to be created\nat some specific point, and can lose its validity just as the aesthetic values embodied\nin the work of art can disappear with the material substratum through which alone\nthey can exist.22 What matters here is less the validity of Herz\u2019s argument than what\nit tells us about his underlying attitude towards law. He did not want to reduce law\nto an expression of \u2018legal consciousness\u2019, let alone emotions of revenge and the like.\nHe did want to insist on the objective validity of legal norms but at the same time to\ngive expression to the fragility of their \u2018lesser ideality\u2019.\nThe extent, and distinctive nature, of Herz\u2019s incipient realism was also evident in\nhis consideration of who or what the subjects of international law are. The debate\nwas enlivened by the arguments of Georges Scelle according to whom only individuals\ncould be the subjects of law and for whom, hence, the distinction between national\nand international law was pointless. Kelsen, although he shared Scelle\u2019s antipathy to\nany kind of anthropomorphism, disagreed. Herz accepted neither position, though\nhe was closer to Kelsen insofar as he believed that it still made sense to talk of states\nas subjects of international law. The issue was why, given that he did not agree with\nKelsen\u2019s claim that international law could not directly assign rights and obligations\nto individuals and did agree with both Scelle and Kelsen that law ultimately\nregulated the behaviour of individuals and nothing else. Herz conceded that the\nclaim that international law depended on the will of states had a \u2018partial sociological\njustification\u2019 insofar as both the creation of and adherence to international law was a\nmatter of the acts and behaviours of the agencies of specific states. But to argue\nfrom this that states could be bound only by their will went too far. There were\nsimply too many cases where international law had been imposed by small groups of\npowerful states. What then justified the personification involved in talking about\nstates in general as subjects of international law? Herz\u2019s answer lay in a shift of\nperspective, focusing on the issue of liability. If one turned to \u2018who is affected by the\ncoercive consequences, a personification of the totality of men forming the \u201cstate\u201d is\nappropriate in the light of the fact that these coercive consequences can affect,\naccording to the circumstances, all or any of them without consideration of individual\nJohn Herz and international order 289\n21 Hans Herz [John H.

The inherent fragility of\ninternational law was evident in the paradox that the norms of international law\ndepended on the existence of certain kinds of persons, that is states, but that these\npersons in turn were dependent for their existence upon \u2018relations of power which\nprepare for their end at any moment and thereby pull the ground from under the\nrules applying to them\u2019.25 He was sceptical about Kelsen\u2019s attempt to construe war\nas a sanction, and thus as means of enforcement of the law, suggesting instead that\nit is more appropriate to see war as a means of changing law than enforcing it. Yet\nthere were limits to his scepticism. Historically he thought that the level of fidelity to\ntreaties was quite remarkable. Moreover, to resort to a flat denial of international law\nwas little more than subservience to the fetishism of the concept of sovereignty.26 His\nconclusion, in 1939, was understandably pessimistic. Speculating on the possibility\nthat as in the development of national polities one powerful unit might be able to\nassert its hegemony over the others, he warned that such a \u2018new society\u2019 would be no\nless free of relationships of domination and that some would prefer the anarchic\nworld of today, but \u2018We who are contemporaries of the decline of the society of\nstates amidst the clash of power and doctrines understand how Hobbes, from the\nexperience of civil war, was ready to hand over all the power of an earthly god to the\nLeviathan\u2019.27\nNational socialist legal theory\nLooking back, Herz noted that Kelsen\u2019s theory hardly seemed appropriate to the\nHitler state and the Holocaust. It seemed rather to fall victim to the same suspicion\nthat it rightly raised against natural law doctrines, namely that of being an ideology.\n\u2018It no longer functioned in extreme situations, to which Carl Schmitt\u2019s theory of the\nstate of the exception fitted better . . .\u201928 Herz, however, was not an adherent of\nSchmitt\u2019s decisionism. In his pioneering study of Nazi international law he argued\nthat while Schmitt appeared to be a very sharp thinker, focused on specific situations,\n290 Peter Stirk\n23 Hans Herz [John H.

This second stage was essentially that of national\nconsolidation of a Greater Germany which ended with the transition to a third\nstage, of open imperialist expansion in March 1939.30 Herz did not follow through\ndevelopments into this third stage, though he noted Carl Schmitt\u2019s attempt to adapt\nto it.31 He did suggest that it would see the emergence of a more consistent doctrine\nand one that fitted in more fully with Nazi ideology as a whole.32 Herz\u2019s assessment\nof these doctrines is evidence of his realist scepticism about the autonomy of\ninternational law but also of its importance. The \u2018lesser ideality\u2019 of international law\ncould be used to expose the cynical manipulation of law by power and the attempt\nto enlist the normative force of law in the interests of power.\nWar years\nExpropriation and international organisation\nAlfons S\u00f6llner has rightly stressed that Herz\u2019s study of the Nazi system was one\nfactor that kept him from adopting a version of the methodological or ontological\nprimacy of foreign policy as advocated by Hans Morgenthau.33 Herz himself\ndescribed his interests as stretching across international politics, comparative politics\nand political theory. Something of this was evident in two essays published in the\nJohn Herz and international order 291\n29 Herz, Die V\u00f6lkerrechtlehre des Nationalsozialismus, p. 120. As late as 1992 Herz still thought it\nworthwhile to ask \u2018Which war situation, which enemy is Schmitt aiming at?\u2019 \u2018Looking at Carl Schmitt\nfrom the Vantage Point of the 1990s\u2019, Interpretation, 19 (1992), p. 308.

Both are also marked by a strong\nsense of the fragility of the international order. Although Herz retrospectively\ndescribed the analysis in one of them as \u2018positivistic-Kelsenian\u2019 in style, both set out\nthe two conflicting approaches to the question of the expropriation of foreign\nproperty: the standard of equal treatment with nationals of the expropriating state\nand the standard of civilisation that claimed compensation even when such com-\npensation was not granted to nationals.34 Finding no consensus whatsoever on the\nrelative merits of the two principles, Herz looked to a \u2018practical compromise\u2019 as the\nbest one might hope for.35 Equally striking is the broader concern about inter-\nnational trends. Given the date of publication his statement that \u2018the very existence\nof what used to be called positive international law (a legal order which was based\non equality, or at least an equilibrium of states) is now in the balance\u2019 is hardly\nsurprising.36 Yet while some comments were clearly related to the war with Germany\nothers seem to be driven by a concern about broader trends. Thus it was the general\ninsistence upon \u2018absolute \u201csovereignty\u201d in dealing with rights of foreigners . . . which\nleads to complete state autarchy. . . . By trying to do away with one of the few\nremaining international procedural institutions, that of diplomatic intervention on\nbehalf of citizens abroad . . . this attitude effectively weakens the only basis on\nwhich international economic relations in a money society can be erected, the basis\nof legal security.\u201937\nSuch sentiments were also evident in \u2018Power Politics and World Organization\u2019\nwhich opened with a quotation from Guglielmo Ferrero: \u2018Power is the supreme\nmanifestation of the fear that man has created for himself by his efforts to liberate\nhimself. It is perhaps the most profound and obscure secret of history.\u201938 Herz later\ndescribed how Ferrero, who had taken part in discussions at Kelsen\u2019s home in\nGeneva in the 1930s, was one of the cornerstones of his idea of the security\ndilemma. The basic insight was already there in Geneva, but Herz could not foresee\nthe bipolarity of the postwar world let alone the impact of the atomic bomb.39 In\n\u2018Power Politics and World Organization\u2019 he illustrated how this operated through the\nbalance of power, arguing that its two functions, namely preservation of the\nplurality of states and the ability of those states to develop autonomous political\ncultures, had been undermined by the competition which was supposed to generate\nthe balance of power. Thus, in the first place \u2018the growing interdependence of the\nnations of the world led to the contrary of what \u201cinternationalists\u201d had hoped its\nresult would be; instead of making for peace and world order, it brought a struggle\nof powers to dominate the world in order to be secure from the world\u2019.40 In the\nsecond place, the nature of the competition had now reached such a pitch that the\ndistinction between peace and war, on which the autonomous development of states\nhad depended, was no longer tenable. This would be true, he predicted, even if there\n292 Peter Stirk\n34 John H.

Here Herz seems to have been\ninfluenced by Carl Schmitt\u2019s prophesy of a division of the world between competing\nGrossr\u00e4ume, even under the assumption of the defeat of the Third Reich. It would\nbe, he wrote, \u2018a world of \u201ctotal suspicion\u201d, worse than at any time before\u2019.41\nSurveying the possible alternatives to this scenario Herz found only the idea of\ncollective security, as an adaptation of the balance of power, to be of any plausibility.\nInterestingly, he turned to the 1930s which most saw as the archetypal failure of\ncollective security to illustrate the possibilities and the problems. It had not been the\nsupposed difficulty in determining the aggressor that was the problem, nor the\nsupposed advantage to an aggressor involved in a Blitzkrieg. Moreover, he insisted\nthat the sanctions against Italy in the 1930s could in fact have brought about the\ndesired result. The prime difficulty was rather the failure to grasp that apparently\ndistant conflicts and dangers were in fact closer than one thought.42 He expressed\nsome hope that the present war might have brought some enlightenment in this\nregard:\nWhile it took the average Englishman from World War times to 1940 to comprehend that the\nairplane had changes his country\u2019s strategic, and therewith political, position, actual\nbombardment, coupled with the threat of immediate invasion caused him to learn in a few\ndays what he had failed to learn in twenty years. Similarly, Pearl Harbour and what may\nensue will have opened the eyes of many an American who failed to realize earlier that\nsanctions against a Japan still at the boundary of China proper might have been preferable to\na \u2018war of survival.\u201943\nBut none of this was certain. Relapse into parochial isolation was still possible. More-\nover, there were yet further obstacles. A system of collective security would work\nonly if it were truly global and violations were infrequent. Were this not the case \u2018the\nresult would be merely the formation of another system of antagonistic blocs and\nalliances\u2019.44\nPolitical Realism and Political Idealism\nAlthough Political Realism and Political Idealism was published in 1951, Herz\nrecalled that the ideas in it were formulated in the late 1930s and early 1940s and the\nbook itself was largely finished before 1945.45 There are some traces of at least the\nearly postwar years, including speculation, dated 1946, on the emerging Cold War\ndivide, and the atomic bomb cast its shadow over Herz\u2019s conclusion.46 Even before\nthe bomb, Herz\u2019s ideas had taken an apocalyptic tone as in \u2018Power Politics and\nWorld Organization\u2019 where he suggested that \u2018the \u201cvictor over Nature\u201d may turn out\nJohn Herz and international order 293\n41 Ibid. p. 1042.

Herz, \u2018Political Realism and Political Idealism (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press,\n1951), pp. 238, 251, 271.\nto have been but another among Nature\u2019s abortive attempts to create a species\ncapable of survival\u2019.47 Political Realism and Political Idealism was an attempt to\nwork out a third way between this dark vision and the unwarranted optimism which\nstood in such stark contrast to it. Herz began by outlining what he called the\npsychological bases of the two types of thought indicated by his title. This was, at\nbest, partially successful since one of the psychological types was rooted in a social\ncondition and not an \u2018anthropological\u2019 or \u2018biological\u2019 one.48 The fear for one\u2019s own\nsurvival arose from uncertainty about the other\u2019s intentions rather than any pre-\nsumption about universal desires for domination or aggression. Indeed Herz\nrepeatedly referred to this point to distinguish the basis of his \u2018realism\u2019 from that of\nMorgenthau\u2019s realism.49 The second psychological basis of human behaviour was\npity or compassion.50 The conflict between the two issued in a sense of guilt which\ncould in turn be suppressed, acted on, albeit only at the expense of self-abnegation\nor withdrawal from the world, or could intermittently intervene in patterns of\nbehaviour marked by concern for survival. The range of behaviour already indicates\nthe rather limited explanatory power of this psychological basis. But even the more\nrobust socially-based security dilemma allowed for a striking range of evaluations.\nThis was evident when Herz turned to the definition of political realism:\nFor \u2018Political Realism\u2019, in our sense, characterizes that type of political thought which in one\nform or another, sometimes not fully and at other times in an exaggerated manner, recognizes\nand takes into consideration the implications for political life of those security and power\nfactors which...are inherent in human society. Even if such thought does not stop at pure\nanalysis and description, but either glorifies the phenomena as ideal or tries to find \u2018rational\u2019\nsolutions of the problems produced by them, it is expressive of realism in our sense so long as\nit recognizes the obstacles which the basic phenomena observed put in the way of any\n\u2018rational\u2019 solution.51\nHerz initially presented political idealism, by contrast, as simply that type of\nthought which did not recognise such limits. Later on, however, he specified that he\nmeant, for example, that type of thought that, even if it recognised that history had\nbeen driven by the considerations outlined by political realism, presumed that other\nconsiderations could become the basis of human behaviour.52 Later on still, Herz\nspecified that political idealism included those \u2018rationalistic\u2019 philosophies that\npresumed that reason was already operative \u2018\u201cin\u201d the facts\u2019 and whose idealism\nconsisted in a denial of the \u2018irrationality\u2019 of the world.53\nThese two types of political idealism had rather different implications. The first\ntype is best represented by Herz\u2019s account of the French revolutionaries or the\nRussian Bolsheviks. In the case of the former, idealism meant a war of liberation,\nconstrued as a final war which allowed for no neutrality. It was a war that,\nconfronted with the frustrating reality of occupation and resistance, tipped over into\n294 Peter Stirk\n47 Herz, \u2018Power Politics and World Organization\u2019, p. 1042.\n48 Herz, Political Realism and Political Idealism, p. 3. As Herz explained, he was trying to formulate a\npsychological typology, p. 2.\n49 See for example, Herz, Vom \u00dcberleben, p. 160.\n50 Herz, Political Realism and Political Idealism, pp. 6\u20137.\n51 Ibid. p. 18.\n52 Ibid., pp. 34\u20135.\n53 Ibid. p. 128.\na nationalistic Realpolitik.54 The historical function of political idealism of this type\n\u2018has been to criticize, attack and destroy rather than to be the foundation of new\nstructure\u2019.55 Political idealism of the second type was rather different, though Herz\ndid not make this explicitly clear. Here his criticism of Kelsen can serve as an\nexample: \u2018This tendency to rationalize is illustrated by Kelsen\u2019s attempt to interpret\nwars so that in each case force is represented as illegal violence on the one side and\nself-defense or retribution on the other\u2019.56 The error here lies less in the utopian\nattempt to realise the unrealisable and more in a denial of the \u2018irrationality\u2019 of\ninternational life.\nIt is clear that Herz could not understand himself as a realist without qualific-\nation, for realism as he defined it was compatible with a veneration of power that he\nnever indulged in. Moreover, Herz\u2019s realism was pervaded by a sense of the con-\ntingency and irrationality of the international world that is difficult to reconcile with\nthe presumption that states are rational actors, which is so commonly held to be a\ndefining element of realism as a doctrine, whether by offensive realism, defensive\nrealism or many of their critics. Nor is his realism easy to reconcile with the\nassumption that the international system is like a market that will guarantee rational\nbehaviour if only by punishing those who disobey its dictates.57 Herz deployed the\nmarket analogy sparingly and only in order to help explain the predominance of\nconsiderations of power, not as any kind of guarantee that reason would prevail.58\nHerz\u2019s position was that of a realist insofar as he believed in the persistence of the\nsecurity dilemma, to which one should add a sense of contingency or irrationality\nwhich set limits to the realm of law. To that extent the fragility of the legal order\nevident in his early writings still formed part of his world view. Herz defined his own\nposition as that of a \u2018realist liberalism\u2019 that entailed an explicit value choice. It was\nindicative of the European origins of his approach that he saw the major challenge\nto this value choice less in the problem of ethical relativism than in the tradition of\nKulturkritik that established a negative correlation between liberalism and cultural\nvalue.59 It was a realism that was still compatible with a vision of collective security,\nunderstood as a modified balance of power. Despite his criticism of Kelsen\u2019s\nlegalism it was a system of collective security in which legal provisions played a\ncrucial role: \u2018The basic elements of the system thus are: (a) recognition of a state\u2019s\nlegal right to existence, and (b) definition of what constitutes an infringement of this\nright (that is, the legal definition of aggression).\u201960 As in his earlier observations,\nhowever, the crucial factor was whether or not states could recognise the general\ninterest in such a system and whether they had the political will to act on that\nrecognition. Yet the prospects were not promising. The concentration of political\npower both domestically and internationally, and the reach of that power, had grown\nJohn Herz and international order 295\n54 Ibid., pp. 78\u201385.\n55 Ibid., p. 36.\n56 Ibid., p. 99.\n57 That \u2018great powers are rational actors\u2019 is one of Mearsheimer\u2019s \u2018Bedrock Assumptions\u2019 , Tragedy of\nGreat Power Politics, p. 31.

This meant that it was no longer \u2018possible for those who are persecuted\nor discriminated against, whom certain developments have rendered \u201csuperfluous\u201d,\nor who have become weary of society or a way of life, to escape into the \u201cunknown\u201d\nparts of the world, either the unknown within the area of their society . . . or, above\nall, into foreign lands. . . .\u201961 Herz held out little hope for a more democratic inter-\nnational order, that was contradicted by the structure of the United Nations. More\nlikely was the emergence of a bipolar world characterised by ideological division and\nnew weapons of destruction.62 In this context the idea of collective security could\ndegenerate into \u2018mere ideology and subterfuge in order to provide bloc-building with\na semblance of legality.\u201963\nThe Cold War world\nGermany and denazification\nHerz had watched denazification from relatively close quarters, and had been\ninvolved in the interrogation of the Nazi Minister of the Interior, Frick. The \u2018Fiasco\nof Denazification in Germany\u2019 as he put it in a 1948 article, was striking both in\nterms what he saw as a misguided denazification policy and in terms of German\nfailure to confront the recent past. In this he shared the views of his colleagues in\nthe Office of Strategic Services, most notably Otto Kirchheimer.64 There was a tone\nof bitterness, to put it mildly, in an observation in a footnote: \u2018[as] if German\nassumption of responsibility for meting out retribution for crimes committed by\nGermans would not have meant a more impressive assumption of sovereignty than\nall the clamouring for \u201coccupation statutes\u201d and similar Allied concessions!\u201965 Herz\ndrew two other broad conclusions from the Third Reich. One was that the level of\ncompliance with the regime, even in relation to its criminality, raised broader questions\nabout the extent to which populations in non-totalitarian societies were likely to\nprotest against the deployment of nuclear weapons.66 The second again drew a\nconnection between the prospect of nuclear war and the Third Reich:\nThe latter atrocity [the Holocaust] appeared so utterly depraved because it denied to the\nvictim that which international \u2018morality\u2019 still considered then a minimum condition for the\n296 Peter Stirk\n61 Ibid, p. 234.\n62 Ibid. pp. 235\u20139.\n63 John H.

Exactly this, however, is denied the victims of the bombs, that\nis, all of us, as it was denied the victims of Hitler\u2019s death camps. And thus our traditional\nstandards and attitudes can no longer measure up to man\u2019s present potentialities.67\nInternational Politics in the Atomic Age\nInternational Politics in the Atomic Age and the associated articles were motivated by\na sense of the \u2018newness\u2019 and \u2018indeterminateness\u2019 of the new age brought about by\nthe historically contingent association of bipolarity and the emergence of nuclear\nweapons.68 In order to make clear the significance of the change Herz set out his\nunderstanding of the basis of the modern state system. Typically, he began with a\nparadox, that is the characterisation of the system as in some sense a community or\nsociety and its characterisation as anarchic. He promptly argued that both character-\nistics were rooted in the existence of state\u2019s \u2018impenetrability\u2019, \u2018impermeability, or\n\u2018territoriality\u2019. In a clear reformulation of his ideas of the 1930s he specified that this\n\u2018territoriality\u2019 formed the \u2018\u201cexistential\u201d basis\u2019 for the jurisdiction claimed by the\nsovereign state. Territoriality was guaranteed by the \u2018hard shell\u2019 that provided the\n\u2018impenetrability\u2019.69 The insight into this development he ascribed to Leibniz, accord-\ning to whom the defensibility of a state, and hence a minimum territorial size, were\nthe basic condition for the existence of sovereignty.70 The sovereign was he who \u2018had\nthe power to constrain his subjects while not being so constrainable by superior\npower. Thus the decisive criterion of sovereignty was the actual, that is, in the final\nresort, the military, control of territory, the pacification of one\u2019s \u201cestates\u201d by one\u2019s\nown military power.\u201971 It was consistent with this that international law, apart that is\nfrom treaty based law, had dealt with the \u2018delimitation of countries\u2019 jurisdictions\u2019.72\nAlthough Herz cited Morgenthau in support, it was, as he later indicated, Kelsen\nwho stood behind this emphasis upon jurisdiction.73\nTerritoriality defined the \u2018structure\u2019 of the modern state system but the \u2018system\u2019\nwas dependent upon other factors, most notably and obviously the balance of\npower. That in turn was not a merely mechanical process but was shaped by a sense\nof community, at least for the states of Europe.74 There is no need to consider this as\nan alien element in Herz\u2019s realism in the way that Robert Jervis is obliged to concede\nthat the \u2018basis and forms of cooperation after the Napoleonic Wars may have rested\non conceptions of common interests and shared responsibilities that are alien to\nJohn Herz and international order 297\n67 John H.

Beyond the \u2018amity lines\u2019 the restraint practised in Europe was\nabandoned.76 Within Europe, first the principle of legitimacy and then that of self-\ndetermination contributed to the \u2018remarkable stability of the statehood of nations\nduring this period\u2019.77 As in Political Realism and Political Idealism Herz interpreted\ncollective security as a modification of the balance of power intended to defend the\nprinciple of territoriality. Hence the League of Nations, true to this structural\nprinciple, had taken into account the defensibility of states seeking membership.\nSignificantly the new United Nations did not.78 That was indicative of a general\ntrend. Collective security had been an option before the Second World War but it\nhad not been grasped. The idea of indivisibility of peace underlying collective\nsecurity was now grasped but collective security was no longer an option. It had\nbeen undermined by bipolarity, the associated ideological division and the destructive-\nness of nuclear power.79\nBipolarity had its own principle of territoriality. \u2018Bipolar territoriality\u2019 was\nsymbolised by the bases or garrisons which the two superpowers established on the\nterritory of their allies or satellites.80 It was an inherently more \u2018precarious\u2019 and\n\u2018rigid\u2019 balance because no others could significantly affect it. The balance, such as it\nwas, was \u2018predetermined\u2019. The old concepts had to be adapted to make sense of this\nnew phenomenon but the concept of territoriality still made sense in the context of\nbipolarity alone. But this was not true of the impact of nuclear weapons. Although\neconomic blockade, ideological penetration and air warfare had all heralded the\ncracking of the \u2018hard shell\u2019, nuclear weapons simply by-passed it. Herz\u2019s conclusion\nwas that \u2018Today, with impermeability gone, insecurity is all pervading\u2019.81 It was\nnotable, however, that the chronology of the transition was qualified in the next\nsentence: \u2018Even in the absence of actual hostilities, therefore, \u201cpeace\u201d in the classical\nsense can no longer be said to prevail; rather we live in that continual uncertainty\nthat lies between \u201cwar\u201d and \u201cpeace\u201d and that already existed in the period between\nthe two world wars\u2019.82 This helps to explain why the themes of suspicion and\nuncertainty predate the atomic age that Herz then used to focus those sentiments.\nThe idea of inhabiting a precarious no-man\u2019s land between war and peace had\noccurred to others too, including Carl Schmitt, though he used it for radically\ndifferent purposes.83 It is, as Herz has emphasised recently, all too relevant today.84\n298 Peter Stirk\n75 Robert Jervis, \u2018Realism in the Study of World Politics\u2019, International Organization, 52 (1998), p. 987.\n76 ibid., pp. 66\u20137.

Herz, \u2018The Security Dilemma in International Relations: Background and Present Problems\u2019,\nInternational Relations, 17 (2003), p. 415.\nAt this point it is worth making two general points about the security dilemma\nand the epochal nature of the changes that Herz believed he was witnessing that\nbring out the distinctiveness of his realism compared with some modern variants. As\nnoted above, Mearsheimer claims that offensive realism can be derived from Herz\u2019s\nconception of the security dilemma. Yet this is true only if one strips the dilemma\nout of the security dilemma. As Snyder, and earlier Glaser, have argued this is\nexactly what Mearsheimer does.85 Snyder puts this well: \u2018Mearsheimer does allow\nthat states do not know each other\u2019s intentions for sure, but he also says that they\n\u201care likely to recognize their own motives at play in the actions of other states\u201d . . .\nIf all are revisionist and believe (correctly) that others are too, it is hard to see any\n\u201cdilemma\u201d.\u201986 It is indeed, and the same underlying presumption of rationality is\nevident in Mearsheimer\u2019s attempt to deflect Glaser\u2019s criticism, in part by mobilising\nand misinterpreting Herz. According to Mearsheimer given Glaser\u2019s interpretation\nof the security dilemma \u2018hardly any security competition should ensue among\nrational states, because it would be fruitless, maybe even counterproductive\u2019.87 In the\ncase of the atomic age Herz had considered this \u2018logic\u2019, namely that security could\nonly be guaranteed by eliminating the competitor at the price of suicide. Herz wrote\nthat the only means of attaining the end of security \u2018precludes the end\u2019, only to\npromptly add \u2018Logical preclusion, of course, offers no guarantee against actual\nresort to all-out war in disregard of rationality\u2019.88\nSecond, Herz interpreted the advent of atomic weapons as something that had a\ndecisive impact upon the structural principle of the international order, namely\n\u2018territoriality\u2019.89 It is true that bipolarity and nuclear weapons have been widely\naccepted as momentous transitions in the international order. Indeed Jervis invokes\nrecognition of their significance as evidence of realism\u2019s ability to respond to \u2018the\npossibilities for \u201cepochal\u201d change\u2019.90 Herz\u2019s realism did precisely that but it is not clear\nthat the same can be said of some other exponents of realism. Thus Mearsheimer\nclaims that \u2018During the Cold War . . . the level of fear between the superpowers\nprobably would have been substantially greater if nuclear weapons had not been\ninvented.\u201991 A common evaluation can be found in Jervis\u2019s seminal article on the\nsecurity dilemma. There he wrote of the introduction of nuclear weapons: \u2018the result is\nthe equivalent of the primacy of defence\u2019.92 Lynn-Jones more cautiously summarises\nthe majority opinion amongst offence-defence theorists to the effect that the \u2018nuclear\nrevolution has significantly shifted the offense-defense balance toward defense.\u201993\nNuclear weapons here are significant, even revolutionary, but they are not seen, as they\nwere by Herz, as something that fundamentally challenged the structural principles of\nthe international order. It is this difference that marks out Herz\u2019s kind of realism.\nJohn Herz and international order 299\n85 Snyder, \u2018Mearsheimer\u2019s World\u2019, p. 155, Charles L.

In International\nPolitics in the Atomic Age, however, he wrote that there was no consensus on what\ncounted as statehood at all. The two blocs adopted different criteria for recognising\n\u2018states\u2019. Not even control of territory was sufficient, or necessary, according to the\ncompeting ideological visions. Similarly \u2018with the evanescence of clear-cut inter-\nnational units and unambiguous frontiers the possibility of applying criteria of\n\u201cviolation of territorial integrity\u201d has vanished too\u2019.94 Writing at the end of the\n1950s he noted that the potential flashpoints, Korea, Berlin, Indo-China, all involved\ncontested boundaries and states. Then and later Herz\u2019s recommendation was that\neach side should respect the de facto demarcation line, disregard the absence of any\nprospect of agreement on the legal status of these entities but recognise that each\nside was committed by its value system to retaining control of its \u2018states\u2019.95 The\nbroader issue of the fate of the territorial state remained, however, a recurrent\nconcern. In \u2018The Territorial State Revisited\u2019, published in 1968, Herz looked back on\nhis essay on the \u2018Rise and Demise of the Territorial State\u2019 which he said had been\nsomewhat rash. He pointed to a variety of factors suggesting a \u2018new territoriality\u2019,\nincluding the declining significance of bases with the development of ICBMs.96 Yet\nhis conclusion suggests that the new territoriality was far from assured: \u2018the pessi-\nmistic conclusion that it is almost too late for the development of \u201cnew territoriality\u201d\nseems realistically, to impose itself \u2019 and the alternative to this new territoriality was\nnot supranationalism but \u2018genuine, raw chaos\u2019.97 That suggestion of raw chaos was\nevident in his comments on the proliferation of states which he described as \u2018often\nsynthetic and nonviable units\u2019.98 The \u2018paradox\u2019 of the discrepancy between their\nlegal equality with the large, established states and the actual distribution of power\nhad reached \u2018fantastic proportions\u2019.99 A decade later Herz was no more optimistic.\nIn many of the new, self-determining nations, the \u2018self \u2019 at stake was problematic at\nbest.100 Their plight was aggravated by the population explosion that lead to another\n\u2018paradox\u2019, namely that while rural populations had been largely self-sufficient, the\n300 Peter Stirk\n94 Herz, International Politics in the Atomic Age, p. 268.\n95 Ibid., pp. 244\u201399. It was consistent with this that Herz later welcomed Brandt\u2019s Ostpolitik and\ndisagreed with Morgenthau\u2019s fears of a new Rapallo.

In the\nWest this welfare function had served to legitimise the state but \u2018most Third World\ncountries omit this legitimizing phase, leaping from premodern stages to the\npolarization of impoverished and super-rich elites\u2019.101\nHerz had become a self-avowed realist, content to emphasise that his position was\ncompatible with that of Kenneth Waltz.102 He took the \u2018basic units\u2019 of international\npolitics to be states. Yet he did not presume that the existence or nature of these\nunits was unproblematic. Even his earlier work was concerned with problems of\nstate succession, with states as the subjects and creators of international law in a\nsystem which threatened them with extinction. He had seen the sovereign equality of\nstates used as a screen behind which lay the unlimited ambition of Nazi Germany.\nHis model of the territorial state was written from the perspective of the demise of\nthe territorial state. His later work dealt with divided states and non-viable states\nand held out the prospect of \u2018genuine raw chaos\u2019. The basic insights behind all this\nlay in the Europe of the 1930s.\nRationality in an uncertain world\nIn International Politics in the Atomic Age Herz gave priority to \u2018structures\u2019 and\n\u2018system\u2019 over motives and actions of statesmen.103 That was consistent with the way\nhis realism was based on a social condition. Yet, as indicated above, the problems of\nacting rationally in an irrational world also formed part of his conception of\nrealism. Those problems were exacerbated both by the logic of nuclear deterrence\nand by broader processes of social \u2018acceleration\u2019.104 Both came together in the\nnovelty of a \u2018world politics\u2019 characterised by a \u2018universality of information and\ndiscourse, universalization of concern, and ubiquitousness of power and weapons\u2019.105\nYet statesmen responded to this, as in the case of the debate about a multilateral\nforce in NATO in the 1960s, with a greater centralisation of control in the interest of\nbeing able to react with speed. In reality, however, even this offered little sense of\ncertainty. The logic of deterrence had become dependent upon a \u2018complicated\nprocess of mutual mind reading\u2019.106 Herz was sceptical about radical attempts to\nescape from this problem. Adherents of mutual deterrence and unilateral dis-\narmament were both \u2018in a sense eighteenth century optimists: the former because\nthey put all stock in rational behaviour, the latter because they must make every-\nthing dependent on \u201cfair play\u201d\u2019.107 Herz showed little more enthusiasm for the\nJohn Herz and international order 301\n101 Ibid., p. 330\n102 \u2018Comment\u2019, pp. 239\u201340.\n103 Herz, International Politics in the Atomic Age, pp. 7\u20138.\n104 Herz based this on the ideas of Alfred Weber and Henry Adams.

Failure to take into\naccount the historical and cultural dimensions meant that they were simply\nmeaningless.108\nThe same sensitivity to historical and cultural context made Herz suspicious of\nthe resort to analogies with the appeasement of the 1930s and especially the\ninvocation of the image of Munich. Herz, who prided himself on his study of Nazi\ntheories of international law, had no sympathy with Chamberlain and company.\nHowever, he saw the rhetoric of appeasement, deployed on all sides in the Cold War,\nas counterproductive, pushing leaders on both sides to portray any compromise as a\nvictory in order to escape the accusation from domestic critics or others of having\nsuccumbed to a policy of appeasement. In the 1960s, in the wake of the Cuban\nmissile crisis, Herz was concerned not only to illustrate the vicious circle this led to\nbut also the sheer inapplicability of the analogy: \u2018Preventive war, which in the 1930s\nmight actually have prevented the subsequent worldwide war, today would be truly\nsuicidal.\u2019109\nThe importance of perception and image were taken up more broadly by Herz in\na significant modification of his position in the 1950s.110 Here not only the\nimportance of analogies like Munich and appeasement were invoked, but also the\nsignificance of metaphor, symbols and the maintenance of image. This was now\napplied quite widely to basic perceptions of the nature of international politics. In\nHerz\u2019s words, \u2018To the critical mind, the world of international relations, with its\nsystems and actors, its groupings and conflicts, results from the perceptual and\nconceptual structures that we, observers or actors, bestow on the world\u2019.111 He was\nwilling to apply this to his earlier account of the balance of power. Whether this had\nin fact existed now appeared contingent. What appeared to be a balance of power,\nsay to English statesmen, appeared to others as a struggle for hegemony in which\nany balance of power was a transient interlude. Similar considerations applied to the\nconcept of power itself and the idea of interests of states. All were filtered through\nthe perceptual and conceptual bestowal of meaning. Yet Herz had not taken flight\ninto pure conceptual relativism. At some point the greater or lesser discrepancy\nbetween perceived world and reality would be exposed, even if only by the\nexperience of war.112\nThat Herz had taken this \u2018subjective\u2019 turn is perhaps not altogether surprising.\nFrom the beginning he had known that the legal order at least was constructed out\nof fictive elements but he had looked for the material substratum underlying them.\nThat was true of the greatest fiction of them all, the state.

Whichever trajectory is right, the search for the\nmaterial substratum or the moment of perceptual and conceptual construction,\nHerz\u2019s move first, and predominantly, in one direction and then in another suggests\nan unwillingness to take either as unproblematic. Herz\u2019s insight into the fictive\nnature of the state and the transient, fragile and intersubjective international order\nstands in stark contrast to the assumption of contemporary realism that the state\nand the international order are durable and persistent. It is notably in this context\nthat Herz himself suggested that the incompatibility of such views with the\ndominant \u2018scientific\u2019 pretensions of the discipline in America at the time lay behind\nthe rejection of an English language version of the article in which they were most\nforcefully expressed.113 These views also place him in proximity to constructivism.\nThere are of course limits to such analogies and much depends on the variety of\nconstructivism at stake. The point is simply that there is no principled barrier\nbetween Herz\u2019s kind of realism and constructivism.114\nUniversal interests\nAnother striking contrast between the kind of realism defended by self-professed\nAmerican realists in the Review of International Studies and Herz lies in the way that\nfrom the end of the 1930s Herz had invoked some conception of a common interest\nin peace which was, or should have been, of evident concern regardless of the\napparent distance from the threat. In International Politics in the Atomic Age he had\nreformulated that as a universal interest in survival. Much later, when Richard\nAshley ascribed a defence of moral principles to him, Herz objected that he had\n\u2018pleaded for substituting enlightened, long-range interest for the immediate parochial\none. In other words universalism, as I conceive it, is based on universal interests,\nsuch as global survival interests, not on unselfish moral principle.\u2019115 His preference\nfor the language of interests need not be taken as evidence of moral indifference or\ninsensitivity. The choice of phrase in many essays and books and the attempt to\nformulate some psychological type on the basis of a sentiment of pity or compassion\nsuggest the contrary. But moral constraint had not fared well when confronted with\nthe pursuit of the national interest. Moreover, in the 1970s he concluded that \u2018We\nhave underestimated society\u2019s (all societies\u2019) capacity for aggression, greed, cowardice,\nand human incapacity to be impressed, morally or even for reasons of mere survival,\nby the excesses of totalitarian regimes.\u2019116 That was an especially bleak observation\neven for Herz but it symbolised part of the problem.\nThe other part of the problem was Herz\u2019s own self-professed value relativism\nwhich had attracted him to Kelsen back in the 1930s. Where there was a clear threat\nto the survival of the species, however, there seemed to be an alternative way\nJohn Herz and international order 303\n113 Herz, \u2018Political Realism Revisited\u2019, p. 185.\n114 I am grateful to an anonymous reviewer for this point. There is a helpful summary of the diversity of\nconstructivism in Christian Reus-Smit, \u2018Imagining Society: Constructivism and the English School\u2019,\nBritish Journal of Politics and International Relations, 4 (2002), pp. 491\u20136.\n115 Herz, \u2018Comment\u2019, p. 238.\n116 Herz, \u2018Power Politics or Ideology?, pp. 31\u20132.\nforward: \u2018when certain values become so overwhelmingly important that their\nnonrecognition appears \u201cabsurd\u201d to practically everybody, they can be considered as\n\u201ccertain\u201d\u2019.117 For Herz this was true of the threat posed by atomic weapons but also\nof the growth of the global population, ecological damage and prospective\nexhaustion of finite resources.118 The difficulty was that any salvation could come\nonly through the mediation of nation-states.\nConclusion\nWhen Richard Little explored the diverse development of modern American realism\nand the English School from a common background in classical realism he omitted\nto make one point, perhaps because he considered it too obvious though other\nreasons may have been at work. The point is well-known: it is the irony that a self-\nconsciously American understanding of realism originated in the ideas of European\nscholars, especially central-European scholars, one of whom was John Herz.\nStressing the European heritage may not sit comfortably with the contrast between\nAmerican realism and the English School, though that is a point that cannot be\ntaken up here.\nMore significant here is the point that Little does make very forcefully, namely\nthat the classical heritage, as exemplified by Morgenthau, was narrowed as it was\ndeveloped and refined. Herz played a smaller, but important role in that process. He\ndid not write a textbook of the status of Politics Among Nations and by his own\naccount the diversity of his interests, in comparative government as well as inter-\nnational relations theory, limited his impact in the latter. Nevertheless, he did\ncontribute to the formation of a realist approach, he was a pioneering figure in\nterms of identifying the \u2018security dilemma\u2019 and his International Politics in the\nAtomic Age was an influential study that earned him the epithet \u2018hard shell-Herz\u2019.119\nIt was indicative of the underlying tension between Herz and the developing\nacademic culture of his adopted homeland that he opened the Preface to Inter-\nnational Politics in the Atomic Age with the assertion that \u2018[t]his is an old-fashioned\nkind of book\u2019.120 The feeling of not being in step clearly had nothing to do with the\nculture clash experienced by the newly arrived. By the time he wrote the Preface he\nhad been in America just over twenty years, had an established academic position\nand had come to understand himself as an \u2018emigrant\u2019 not an \u2018exile\u2019.121\nWhat was at issue here was the development of an approach to IR theory to\nwhich Herz, the self-avowed realist, contributed but which took on a form that was\nultimately inconsistent with Herz\u2019s world view. That can be seen by contrasting\nHerz\u2019s approach with Little\u2019s contenders in the Review of International Studies. As\n304 Peter Stirk\n117 John H.

Theory is, of\ncourse, not seen as static. The fundamental concepts remain the same but refinement\nis possible and greater analytical rigour and explanatory power are held out as the\nvirtues of American realism. It is here that the gap between Herz and this kind of\nrealism really opens up. It can be illustrated by the almost casual way in which\nCopeland invokes Hitler\u2019s \u2018takeovers of Austria and the Sudetenland\u2019 as \u2018but one\nexample\u2019 of the way in which states \u2018cheat\u2019 by manipulating international norms.130\nAs explained above, Herz wrote at length on National Socialist international law,\nand exposed its manipulation of such norms, but not as \u2018but one example\u2019 of\nanything. What Herz was warning was that this state was utterly different and, later,\nthat the Munich analogy was dangerous in a changed world. That leads on to a\nbroader point made in the \u2018Introduction\u2019 to International Politics in the Atomic Age:\nIt will be the main thesis of this study that some of the factors which underlay the \u2018modern\nstate system\u2019 . . . and which determined rather stably its structure and relationships have now,\nin our century and even within the lifetime of many of us, undergone such fundamental\nchanges that the structure of international relations is different, or in the process of becoming\ndifferent, and can no longer be interpreted exclusively in traditional terms.131\nJohn Herz and international order 305\n122 Little, \u2018The English School vs. American Realism\u2019, p. 443.\n123 Charles L.

That sentiment was already\nevident before Herz became a self-avowed \u2018realist\u2019. It can be explained in part simply\nby the turbulence of the short twentieth century but of course not all who lived\nthrough part at least of that century drew the same conclusions that Herz did.\nHowever, a sense of the dramatic challenge to the international order, its basic units\nand principles, was a common European response, even amongst those, like Carl\nSchmitt, whom Herz clearly opposed.132\nHerz\u2019s scepticism about the application of game theories, simulation and computers\nas well, more broadly, of quantitative techniques, is quite consistent with this sense\nof the fragility, dynamism and unpredictability of the international order. Indeed, it\nis arguable that the enhanced predictability promised by American realism ultimately\nstrips the dilemma out of the security dilemma. Herz took the dilemma seriously but\nthis did not reduce him to a passive fatalism. He even differed from this kind of\nAmerican realism in developing an ethical stance that was derived from his\nunderstanding of international politics. This point should not be pushed too far. He\ncannot be retrospectively claimed for the English School. Herz was a realist. He can\nbe counted amongst those described by Jonathon Haslam as \u2018sensitive and\npenetrating, in some cases utopian, minds that over-reacted to dramatic, unheralded\nand therefore unexpected outbursts of violence and their consequences\u2019.133 This\nserves as a better description of Herz than it does of the kind of American realism\nrecently advanced in the Review of International Studies. Herz is worth re-reading\nbecause of his role in the formation of American realism but also because of the\ntension that emerged between that realism and Herz\u2019s kind of realism.134 He is also\nworth re-reading by those who believe that they are confronted by \u2018dramatic,\nunheralded and therefore unexpected outbursts of violence and their consequences\u2019,\neven if they do not see themselves as utopians and have no wish to over-react.\n306 Peter Stirk\n132 See, for example, two of Schmitt\u2019s longer works: V\u00f6lkerrechtliche Grossraumordnung (Berlin:\nDeutscher Rechtsverlag, 1941) and Der Nomos der Erde.\n133 Jonathon Haslam, No Virtue Like Necessity: Realist Thought in International Relations since\nMachiavelli (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2002), p. 252.\n134 Thus avoiding the misleading elision made by Koskenniemi, The Gentle Civilizer of Nations, p. 467.\nContra Koskenniemi, Herz did not espouse a Hobbesian anthropology. He identified his own position\nas closer to Burke than Hobbes or Locke: International Politics in the Atomic Age, p. 234. Jack\nDonnelly draws a distinction between the \u2018strong realism\u2019 of Morgenthau and Waltz and the \u2018hedged\nrealism\u2019 of Herz and Carr, Realism and International Relations (Cambridge: Cambridge University\nPress, 2000), pp. 12\u201313.\n"}
