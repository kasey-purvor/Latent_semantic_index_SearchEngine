Rose Tremain\u2019s \nSacred Country (1992), winner of the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and the Prix \nF\u00e9mina Etranger, traces the transition of its central character from Mary to Martin Ward \nand is significant both because it makes the FTM visible and because it subverts the myth \nthat manhood is an inviolable state, or sacred country, inhabited by a privileged group of \nsubjects: real men.  However, rather than asserting the realness of the FTM, Tremain \nquestions the very notion of the real. Inspired by queer theory\u2019s critique of an \u2018original \nand true sex\u2019 (Butler 1990: viii), this essay proposes that Sacred Country affirms not the \nauthenticity of transsexual manhood but the impossibility of sexed realness, and confirms \nJudith Butler\u2019s contention that \u2018\u201cbeing\u201d a sex or a gender is fundamentally impossible\u2019 \n(Butler 1990: 19). By paralleling the experience of her transsexual protagonist with a \nseries of male characters who struggle to reinvent themselves as men in the changing \n  \n2 \n \nlandscape of post-war Britain, Tremain not only rescues the FTM from the status of \n\u2018Other\u2019 but also presents him as a typical rather than an exceptional man.1\n \n  \n\u2018To be\u2026\u2019: The Desire for Embodiment \nThrough its representation of transsexuality, Sacred Country explores whether it is \npossible to be a man (or, by implication, a woman). The novel opens with six year-old \nMary\u2019s realization that \u2018I am not a girl. I\u2019m a boy\u2019 (p. 6), an insight unconsciously \nprompted by the two-minute silence held in honour of George VI, whose death marks the \nmonarch\u2019s transition from king to queen and indirectly articulates Mary\u2019s own desire to \nchange sex.2\n \n This desire is also expressed through Mary\u2019s interest in Hamlet: she writes \nan essay on the play and is offered the part of the Prince when her grandfather, Cord, \nproposes that they read it together one Christmas.  As the role of Hamlet has often been \nperformed by a woman, most famously by Sarah Siddons (1776) and Sarah Bernhardt \n(1899), but also by Asta Nielsen (1921), who portrayed Hamlet as a woman passing as a \nman, Mary\u2019s identification with Shakespeare\u2019s hero communicates her wish to change \nsex. Also, references to Hamlet, which include the novel\u2019s second epigraph, implicitly \ninvoke the debate \u2018to be or not to be\u2019 in the context of transsexuality. \nIn Second Skins: The Body Narratives of Transsexuality (1998), Jay Prosser notes \nthat transsexual narratives are characterised by an investment in the materiality of sex and \ntypically trace a \u2018somatic progression toward the goal of sexed embodiment\u2019 (Prosser \n1998: 67). Initially, Sacred Country seems exemplary in this regard. Although she has a \nfemale body, Mary does not identify as a girl and seeks a physical form that reflects and \n  \n3 \n \nconfirms her innate sense of maleness. As she tells her doctor, \u2018I\u2019m not really a girl. I \nnever have been \u2026 I have always felt male\u2019 (p. 151). Mary understands transsexuality in \nterms of the wrong body formula and experiences a painful dissonance between her \nimagined and material self. She denies her menses, thinks of her breasts as \u2018parasites\u2019 and \n\u2018dreams of cutting out her womb and burying it in Antarctica\u2019 (p. 112; p. 227). In her \nletter to an agony aunt, Mary explains: \u2018I am a woman of twenty-one. Or rather, my body \nis a woman\u2019s body, but I have never felt like a woman or colluded with my body\u2019s deceit\u2019 \n(p. 199). She signs her letter \u2018Divided\u2019 from Devon (p. 200), and self-division is \nreiterated in the figure of Thomas Hardy, whose head and heart are buried apart and \nwhose poetry is read by Mary\u2019s teacher and friend, Miss McRae.  \n \nProsser points out that transsexual subjects frequently articulate their bodily \nalienation as discomfort with their physical casing (Prosser 1998: 68). Reflecting this, \nMary\u2019s desired male body is imagined as a new skin: \u2018I remember the feel of my body, \ntrying to grow its man\u2019s skin\u2019 (p. 37). Mary undertakes a process of self-fashioning and \nabandons dresses in favour of an aertex shirt, grey shorts and plimsolls (p. 58). In \nLondon, she throws out her female clothes.  Her \u2018suicided skirts\u2019 symbolise her wish to \nrid herself of the female body that she finds so foreign and mark \u2018the start of her \nhappiness\u2019 (p. 178; p. 183). Echoing Garber\u2019s contention that \u2018Clothes do not maketh the \nman, but allow him to be seen\u2019 (Garber 1992: 117), suits, jeans and jackets enable others \nto see Mary as she sees herself, that is, as Martin, and bring to an end her days as an \ninvisible man.  \n \n  \n4 \n \nHowever, changing clothes is not enough to satisfy Mary\u2019s desire for a new skin \nand when her body fails to change of its own accord, as she initially expects it to - \u2018a \npenis will grow out of all that is locked away inside. It needs only time\u2019 (p. 34) - she \nseeks medical support. Mary finally finds a sympathetic psychiatrist in Sterns, whose \naxolotl, a salamander that possesses the ability to change from an aquatic to an air-\nbreathing animal, reflects his interest in shape-shifters. Working with Sterns, she begins a \n\u2018monitored metamorphosis\u2019 (p. 244), and when hormones bring on male puberty, she tells \nher friend Pearl, \u2018With the injections I\u2019m having now, my time as Mary is going to come \nto an end\u2019 (p. 249). Mary starts to pass as a man and people call her \u2018Lad\u2019 and \u2018Sir\u2019 (p. \n259; p. 264). Following surgery, she leaves England for America, a land renowned for its \ncelebration of the self-made man, where Mary is accepted as \u2018an ordinary man, not an \nimaginary one\u2019 (p. 338).  \n \nWhile Sacred Country follows the pattern of transsexual narratives identified by \nProsser, it digresses in one significant way. At first, Mary craves a penis in order to \nachieve a coherent sense of maleness. She fantasises about making love to women as a \nman and is jealous of the usher at Lyndsey\u2019s wedding: \u2018I had a stab of envy for his long, \nsmart legs and what he carried between them\u2019 (p. 168). According to Prosser, because it \nis currently impossible to construct a fully functioning penis, the FTM\u2019s unfulfilled desire \nfor this appendage is a source of profound pain and anxiety. In his essay \u2018A Palinode on \nPhotography and the Transsexual Real\u2019, Prosser employs Lacanian theory to articulate \nthe trauma associated with wounds, scars and \u2018an absence of parts\u2019 that \u2018won\u2019t allow a \npre-reassignment history to disappear into the apparent reality of reassigned sex\u2019 (Prosser \n  \n5 \n \n1999: 85). One of Lacan\u2019s three psychic realms or orders (Real, Symbolic, Imaginary), \nthe Real denotes plenitude and completeness: \u2018there is no absence in the real\u2019 (Lacan \n1988: 313). However, because the Real is beyond language or \u2018outside symbolisation\u2019 \n(Lacan 1977: 388), it is \u2018impossible\u2019 to attain (Lacan 1988: 167) - it is \u2018the missed \nencounter\u2019 (Lacan 1981: 55) - and thus associated with trauma: the Real is \u2018the object of \nanxiety par excellence\u2019 (Lacan 1988: 160). Prosser proposes that missing parts mean that \ntranssexuals fail to be \u2018real, that is to be real-ly sexed\u2019 (Prosser 1999: 84).  \n \nSacred Country likewise suggests that manhood is, in Lacanian terms, the Real \nthing. The name that Mary takes prior to transition articulates the unspeakable trauma \nassociated with FTM transition identified by Prosser. Mary calls herself \u2018Mary Martin\u2019 \nafter her grandfather\u2019s favourite actress (p. 53), a woman famous for playing Peter Pan, \nalthough the name also invokes Mario (formerly Marie) Martino, author of the FTM \nautobiography Emergence (1977). Allusions to Peter Pan articulate both Mary\u2019s desire to \nbecome a man and her fear that she will never do so because, as an eternal boy, Peter \nnever reaches manhood. More specifically, Peter Pan expresses castration anxiety, \nsymbolised by Hook\u2019s missing hand and Peter\u2019s shadow, from which he becomes \ndetached (Garber 1992: 178). Sterns\u2019 axolotl suggests similar concerns. Mary\u2019s attempt \nto make the word \u2018axolotl\u2019 in a game of Scrabble points to her identification with this \ncreature that possesses the ability to shift shape (p. 315). However, again, the axolotl \nrepresents Mary\u2019s fears as well as her wishes because neoteny, a defining feature of this \ncreature, delays sexual maturity. In other words, like Peter Pan, the axolotl never \n  \n6 \n \nachieves physiological maturity and its name, \u2018Ken\u2019 (p. 308), underlines Mary\u2019s \ncastration anxieties through its invocation of Barbie\u2019s famously penis-less companion.  \n \nYet, while Mary longs for a penis, Martin finally refuses one. Judith Shapiro notes \nthat transsexuals often hold conservative views of what it means to be a man or a woman \nand endorse the social norms of gender (Epstein & Straub 1991: 253). Mary\u2019s \nstereotypical ideas about male behaviour suggest that her desire for a penis is the product \nof the heroic ideal of patriarchal manhood. Early on, she carries her hockey stick like a \n\u2018rifle\u2019 (p. 119), longs to join a regiment and dreams of rescuing Estelle from the asylum \nwhere she is sent after a breakdown: \u2018I was a knight\u2026I put my mother on my grey \ncharger and rode away\u2019 (p. 55). However, Mary\u2019s image of herself as a knight indicates \nthat her notion of manhood, to which the penis is crucial, is as outdated and redundant as \nchivalry itself. This is an insight that Martin seems to acquire.  When Sterns calls him \nback to England for a phalloplasty, Martin refuses to return because he has found \ncontentment and reached \u2018a plateau, a level place\u2019 (p. 353). The non-phallic imagery \nechoes his assertion that he no longer dreams of possessing a penis. Thus, in contrast to \ntranssexual narratives which overestimate the penis as \u2018the absolute insignia of maleness, \nthe index of male identity\u2019 (Garber 1992: 97-8), Sacred Country insists that the penis is \nnot the seat of male subjectivity. In short, a penis is superfluous to Martin\u2019s identity as a \nman. \n \n\u2018\u2026or not to be\u2019: The Impossibility of Sexed Realness \n  \n7 \n \nHowever, more radical than suggesting that Martin can be a man without a member, \nSacred Country questions the notion of sexed realness. Throughout the novel, Tremain \npersistently subverts the boundary between imagination or appearance and reality. For \nexample, imaginary events have material effects and consequences. Mary dreams about \nsaving Pearl from drowning so often that she feels exhausted: \u2018I\u2019d begun to worry I \nwouldn\u2019t have any strength left for the real thing\u2019 (p. 132). Likewise, Estelle, has a sexual \ndream powerful enough to induce orgasm: \u2018Nothing and no one touched me, except in a \ndream. But the orgasm was real and I woke up in the middle of it and cried with pleasure\u2019 \n(p. 321). Mary\u2019s history teacher proposes that although the Round Table probably never \nexisted, \u2018it existed down the centuries in people\u2019s minds, so you could say that it has the \nexistence of a certain kind\u2019 (p. 96). Similarly, Mary\u2019s friend, Edward Harker, is so \nconvinced that there is a rodent trapped under his hat that he removes it to look inside but \nfinds \u2018nothing\u2019 there (p. 228). Conversely, what is real seems fake, fictional or illusory. \nNoting the stillness of his hens, Sonny wonders if they are \u2018decoys\u2019 and asks himself, \u2018is \nthis a real sight?\u2019 (p. 162-3), and Lyndsey thinks that Queen Boadicea is \u2018an invented \nperson, like Mrs Danvers\u2019 (p. 169). Returning home, Mary\u2019s brother, Timmy thinks his \nroom looks \u2018just as he\u2019d left it and yet it didn\u2019t look like his room but like a \nreconstruction of his room, like a film set built to deceive him\u2019 (p. 285). Walter\u2019s plans to \nvisit the \u2018real\u2019 Tennessee \u2018with its faithful darkies and its faithful dogs\u2019 reveal a \nromanticised view of the Deep South that draws on racial stereotypes and denies the \nreality of African Americans (p. 41). Epitomising the novel\u2019s problematisation of the \nreal, when Mary waves Harker off from London, their good-bye is frustrated by the \n  \n8 \n \ntrain\u2019s false departure, which \u2013 like the novel\u2019s deconstruction of sexual identity - \nengenders uncertainty about what constitutes \u2018the real thing\u2019 (p. 234). \n \nIn line with Butler, Tremain suggests that while \u2018sex poses as \u201cthe real\u201d and the \n\u201cfactic\u201d\u2019, the \u2018\u201creal\u201d and the \u201csexually factic\u201d are phantasmic constructions \u2013 illusions of \nsubstance\u2019 (Butler 1990: 146). After surgery, Mary describes herself as \u2018insubstantial\u2019 (p. \n293), and the \u2018silk scarf\u2019 that Martin uses to pad his Y-fronts recalls the \u2018knotted silks\u2019 \nthat Mary associates with magic (p. 338, p. 79), suggesting that the material substance of \nsex is an illusion. Likewise, Timmy describes himself, as well as his mother and \ngrandmother, as \u2018genetically insubstantial\u2019 (p. 283). Although Mary employs a strategic \nessentialism to explain her transsexuality when she asserts \u2018I was a boy inside\u2019 (p. 56), \nWalter indicates that what appears to be internal is ingested: \u2018I feel as if I\u2019m full of \nsomething that isn\u2019t mine, as if I was the whale that swallowed a man\u2019 (p. 62). The \nabsence of an essential or core self is epitomised by Estelle\u2019s story about an onion: as a \nyoung woman, she witnesses a man \u2018trying to find the onion after all the layers of peel. \nHe gets to the heart of it and there is nothing\u2019 (p. 42). Estelle\u2019s name (est-elle: French for \nis she) suggests that she believes that identity is rooted in being and substance. \nConsequently, Estelle is terrified by the idea that the self has no centre and perpetual \n\u2018worry about the onion\u2019 causes acute mental stress (p. 59).  In contrast, Mary is excited \nby Grandma Livia\u2019s Dictionary of Inventions, which suggests \u2018you could invent yourself\u2019 \n(p. 31).  \n \n  \n9 \n \nImages of flight also subvert essentialism by suggesting that gender is groundless. \nAs the novel\u2019s title indicates, Tremain employs landscape as a trope for sexual identity \nand Mary\u2019s transatlantic journey takes her across borders into a new country literally and \nmetaphorically as she travels from Britain (typically personified as a woman: Britannia) \nto the States (often personified as a man: Uncle Sam). Like her unconventional \ngrandmother, who had a passion for gliding and \u2018found life in a silent plane, held aloft by \ncurrents of air\u2019 (p. 43), Mary is a \u2018cloud artist\u2019 who seeks to evade borders through flight \n(p. 141). As a young girl, she stands on the swing, pushing \u2018her body out and up into the \ngrey sky\u2019 moving \u2018higher and higher\u2019, fantasizing that \u2018she and it flew vertically above \nthe pine\u2019 (p. 31). Mary believes that if she can make this fantasy reality \u2018becoming a boy \nwould happen\u2019 (p. 31). She also imagines working \u2018in a factory making gliders\u2019 and is \ngood at drawing \u2018helicopters\u2019 (p. 173; p. 261). Her desire for the freedom connoted by \nflight is likewise signified by the story she invents about Joseph Montgolfier, \u2018inventor of \nthe hot-air balloon\u2019 (p. 35), her wish to be a green tennis ball \u2018hurled in the air\u2019 (p. 46), \nher love of vaulting - \u2018She hit the springboard hard, and flew\u2019 (p. 95) - and her \n(unconscious) identification with Peter Pan.  \n \nLike Butler, Tremain illustrates that gender is performative, a matter of \u2018doing\u2019 \nrather than \u2018being\u2019 (Butler 1990: 25). By showing that apparently natural behaviour \nresults from practice or habit, the novel demonstrates that gender is \u2018a kind of persistent \nimpersonation that passes as the real\u2019 (Butler 1990: viii). Mary\u2019s pet guineafowl struggles \nto fly because it \u2018never practised\u2019 (p. 32), Walter\u2019s relationship with Sandra flounders \nbecause he has no \u2018practice\u2019 of love (p. 62), Harker knows \u2018what kind of person a father \n  \n10 \n \nhas to try to be\u2019 because of \u2018years of practice\u2019 with his step-children (p. 207), and Cord \ncontinues to wipe his left eye, a \u2018habit\u2019 he develops when ill, even once he is recovered \nand his eye no longer weeps (p. 223). Mary believes that if she makes the swing fly high \nenough to tip over the frame, completing a circle, she will become a boy and this is \nsimply a matter of \u2018practice\u2019 (p. 32).  \n \nThe questions asked by Dr Beales, the psychiatrist that Mary visits for sex \ncounselling, also point to the performativity of gender: \u2018He asked me whether I could \nmend an electric fuse and whether I knew the rules of cricket\u2019 (p. 202). Mary imitates \nestablished patterns of male behaviour and her performance of masculinity indicates that \nmanhood is constituted by the very \u2018\u201cexpressions\u201d that are said to be its results\u2019 (Butler \n1990: 25). For example, she drinks Guinness \u2018quickly, like Sonny drank it\u2019 (p. 184). The \nboots that Walter helps Martin choose have a similar effect to the jeans that make Mary \nfeel \u2018potent\u2019 and \u2018bigger than she was\u2019 (p. 178): \u2018In them I feel tall. I swagger\u2019 (p. 344). \nThe money that Miss McRae sends Mary illustrates that \u2018money makes the man\u2019: it \nallows her to buy a \u2018suit and a kipper tie\u2019 (p. 264), to have her shoes shined, give people \ntips, and buy women drinks. As Mary states, \u2018After I\u2019d received Miss McRae\u2019s \u00a31,000, it \nwas much easier to behave like a man\u2019 (p. 264).  \n \nThe \u2018like\u2019 in Mary\u2019s statement confirms Beales\u2019s assertion that while hormones \nand surgery will enable her to \u2018pass\u2019 as a man, she will never \u2018be\u2019 one (p. 203). Although \nMary imagines that she is a boy and will grow up to be a man, her grandmother\u2019s death \ndemonstrates that she imagines things \u2018wrongly\u2019 (p. 315). Mary romanticises Livia\u2019s \n  \n11 \n \ndeath in the glider: \u2018she dreamed of it just drifting away into a white sky, dissolving and \ngone\u2019 (p. 7). Thus Cord\u2019s revelation that Livia was electrocuted when the glider suddenly \nplummeted into pylon wires prompts Mary\u2019s realisation that the death she imagined was, \nlike her transition to manhood, \u2018an impossible thing\u2019 (p. 315). The impossibility of being \na man is also conveyed by the chapter titles, which do not acknowledge \u2018Martin\u2019 until \nChapter Eighteen, near the end of the novel, even though Mary calls herself and asks \nothers to call her \u2018Martin\u2019 from Chapter Four. As the switch occurs when Tremain\u2019s \nprotagonist moves to the States and passes as an \u2018ordinary\u2019 man, the novel suggests, \nfollowing Bishop Berkeley (the champion of immaterialism), that \u2018to be is to be \nperceived\u2019. Furthermore, Martin\u2019s statement, \u2018I\u2019m concentrating on being\u2019 (p. 340), \nimplies that \u2018being\u2019 does not come naturally but requires constant effort, which calls the \nnaturalness of being into question. The novel likewise suggests the impossibility of being \na man, of inhabiting the \u2018I\u2019, when Martin refers to his male self in the third person, \ncreating a split between \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018him\u2019: \u2018Days unfold. Martin lives them\u2026 I am him and \nhe is me and that\u2019s all. That\u2019s enough\u2019 (p. 353). As the split between \u2018he\u2019 and \u2018me\u2019 \nsuggests, the ideal self is unobtainable.  \n \nThrough its use of the journey metaphor, a pervasive trope in transsexual \nnarratives (Prosser 1998: 117), Sacred Country suggests that identity is a matter of \nbecoming rather than being, or, to borrow terms coined by Paul Gilroy in a postcolonial \ncontext, \u2018routes\u2019 rather than \u2018roots\u2019 (Gilroy 1993). In contrast to Mary, who undertakes a \n\u2018journey of physical change and reconstruction\u2019 (p. 229), which involves a literal journey \nto the States, Estelle is stuck in a miserable marriage to a violent husband, Sonny \n  \n12 \n \nstubbornly refuses to leave the farm (p. 286), and Pete Loomis, Walter\u2019s uncle, lives in a \ntrolley bus with no wheels, surrounded by ever-encroaching cows. The importance of \nmovement is underlined by their tragic fate:  Estelle suffers from depression, Sonny \ncommits suicide and Pete dies of cancer. As Cord notes, \u2018staying in one place disfigured \nyou\u2019 (p. 137).  \n \nHowever, if FTM transition is a journey, it is one without end.  Mary is aware that \nshe is engaged in a process of \u2018becoming\u2019 (p. 266), but tells Cord, after surgery, that \nbecoming Martin \u2018isn\u2019t finished and never can be, really\u2019 (p. 313). The incompleteness of \ntransition is mirrored in the dates that accompany chapter titles, which run \nchronologically from 1952 to 1980 but contain conspicuous and apparently random gaps. \nThe missing years, which reflect Martin\u2019s missing parts, suggest that identity, like \nhistory, is always partial and incomplete. By highlighting the inevitably unfinished nature \nof transition, the novel abandons what Judith Halberstam terms \u2018the constrictive \nterminology of crossing\u2019, which maintains the myth of sexual difference, the belief that \nthere is a \u2018natural divide to be spanned by surgery, by disguise, by passing\u2019 (Rivkin and \nRyan 1998: 760). Like the title of Kate Bornstein\u2019s play, The Opposite Sex is Neither, \nSacred Country suggests that there is \u2018no \u201cother\u201d side, no \u201copposite\u201d sex\u2019 (Halberstam \n1998: 760). Preparing Mary for sex reassignment, Beales tells her, \u2018you will not be a \nman. Nor will you any longer be a woman\u2019 (p. 203). Sexual ambiguity is suggested by \nthe \u2018capon\u2019 (p. 137), a castrated cockerel, that Cord promises to cook for Mary one \nChristmas and Martin\u2019s name, which invokes a \u2018freemartin\u2019, a genetically female calf that \npossesses male characteristics and exhibits masculine behaviour. Likewise, while sex \n  \n13 \n \nreassignment changes Mary\u2019s body geography, the absence of a penis indicates that, \nanatomically, the post-reassignment land Martin inhabits is a \u2018cunt-ry\u2019 in which he holds \ndual citizenship. The phantasmal character of the \u2018other\u2019 side is also suggested by the \nlocation in which Mary passes as Martin, Tennessee, described as an \u2018imaginary place\u2019 \n(p. 269).  \n \nThe novel also questions the belief that there are two distinct sexes, that bodies \nare \u2018morphologically binary\u2019 (Butler 1990: 6), through the suggestion that Mary is as \n\u2018sexually blended, gender-bended\u2019 as Martin (Bornstein 1994: 11). Estelle describes \nMary\u2019s body as \u2018peculiar\u2019 (p. 141), and Mary tells her doctor that she has \u2018in some \nrespects\u2019 a girl\u2019s body (p. 151). Her position in bed, lying \u2018between\u2019 Sonny and Estelle \n(p. 12), signals the inbetweenness of her identity, as does the location of Beales\u2019s office: \n\u2018Middlesex\u2019 (p. 201). Mary contradicts Cord\u2019s belief that \u2018everything important in life is \ndual, like being and not being, male and female, and that there was no country in \nbetween\u2019 (p. 148) and locates herself in \u2018no-man\u2019s land\u2019 (p. 168). This contradicts most \ntranssexual autobiographies, which, as Sandy Stone notes, deny \u2018mixture\u2019 and present (in \nthe case of MTF transsexuality) \u2018unambiguous men\u2019 becoming \u2018unambiguous women\u2019 \nwith \u2018no territory between\u2019 (Stone 1991: 286). \n \nSacred Country affirms sexual ambiguity as natural with subtle reminders that \nnature frequently defies sexual difference. Anne Fausto-Sterling notes that nature is \nequated with \u2018the real\u2019 (Fausto-Sterling 2000: 22), but she, like Bonnie B. Spanier, shows \nthat nature is a social construct: \u2018When scientists look to nature, they usually bring with \n  \n14 \n \nthem their sociopolitical beliefs about what is natural\u2019 (Spanier 1991: 330). Thus, when \nnature is interpreted through a heteropatriarchal lens, examples that subvert a binary sex-\ngender system are overlooked or ignored. Like Spanier and Fausto-Sterling, Tremain \ninvokes myriad plants and animals that, like the freemartin, challenge the fixed and \noppositional categories of male and female. When Mary gets lost in the woods, she is \ncarrying a bucket with a picture of a starfish on it (starfish are not only hermaphrodites \nbut also associated with metamorphosis because they begin life in a larval form). Mary \nfirst confides the secret of her transsexuality in Marguerite, her pet guineafowl (almost \nidentical in appearance, male and female guineafowl are notoriously difficult to sex). \nAlso, like most argyranthemums, the flower evoked by Marguerite\u2019s name (the \nMarguerite Daisy) is a hybrid. The naturalness of transformation itself is suggested when \nMary compares herself to \u2018pupa\u2019 (p. 95), a life stage of insects that undergo complete \nmetamorphosis like the \u2018silkworms\u2019 in her classroom (p. 36). Pearl\u2019s name, which evokes \nthe piece of grit transformed into a gemstone inside a mollusk, underlines that change is \nnot only natural but also valuable. Miss McRae teaches Mary that nature is \n\u2018extraordinary\u2019 and \u2018marvelous\u2019 (p. 29), and the wonderful plants and animals that she \nsees in the Natural History Museum remind her that \u2018we live on the planet of the \nunexpected\u2019 (p. 246). After a visit to the museum, Mary tells Pearl that her sex change is \n\u2018no stranger than millions of other things on earth\u2019 (p. 249).  \n \nDiversity and variation in the natural world indicates that sexual difference is a \nconstruct imposed by the medical establishment. This is exemplified by the doctor who, \ndiscovering that Mary has not started to menstruate, attempts to press her body into \n  \n15 \n \nconformity: he diagnoses \u2018hormone deficiency\u2019 and prescribes pills that will \u2018bring on\u2019 \nbleeding (pp. 151-2). Similarly, Sterns exemplifies Butler\u2019s contention that the \nembodiment of norms is a \u2018compulsory practice\u2019 (Butler 1993: 231) when he \n\u2018commands\u2019 Martin to return for a phalloplasty on the grounds that the creation of a penis \nis of \u2018critical importance\u2019 (p. 352). The violence that underscores the dominant order\u2019s \nregulation of the cultural norms of gender and sexual identity is underlined when Sonny \nsends Marguerite to be killed and when he attacks Mary, tearing open her shirt to expose \nher breasts. \n \nIf Martin is ambivalently sexed, this does not exclude him from the category \n\u2018man\u2019 in the way that Janice Raymond or J. Michael Bailey call for the exclusion of MTF \ntranssexuals from the category \u2018woman\u2019 on the grounds that they are not \u2018real\u2019 women \nbut men attempting to colonise a female body (Raymond 1979: 103-4) or effeminate gay \nmen (Bailey 2003). Rather, the incoherence of Martin\u2019s identity subverts the binary sex-\ngender system upheld by Raymond and Bailey\u2019s essentialism by exemplifying Butler\u2019s \npoint that \u2018to go from F to M, or from M to F, is not necessarily to stay within the binary \nframe of gender, but to engage transformation itself as the meaning of gender\u2019 (Butler  \n2004: 65). Thus, if Martin is not a real or \u2018true\u2019 man (p. 203), it is because sexed realness \nis impossible. \n \nMan-Maid Men \nIn \u2018The Empire Strikes Back: A Posttranssexual Manifesto\u2019, Stone calls on transsexuals \nto forgo passing, that is, to become \u2018posttranssexual\u2019, and to trade social acceptability for \nthe opportunity to construct a counterhegemonic discourse about gender by speaking \n  \n16 \n \n\u2018from outside the boundaries of gender, beyond the constructed oppositional nodes which \nhave been predefined as the only positions from which discourse is possible\u2019 (Stone \n1991: 295). In contrast to Stone and \u2018gender outlaws\u2019 like Bornstein and Feinberg, who \ndefy the binary categories of gender, Martin\u2019s desire to pass as an \u2018ordinary\u2019 man appears \nto undermine the radical potential suggested by his sexual ambiguity. However, by \nconstructing parallels between Mary\/Martin and a cast of \u2018man-maid men\u2019 - characters \nwho highlight both the construction and incoherence of gender \u2013 Sacred Country \nsuggests that transsexuals are subversive because they \u2018make us realize that we are all \npassing\u2019 (Shapiro 1991: 257), and underline that the failure to be \u2018male-y real\u2019 is \n\u2018universally inevitable\u2019 (Prosser 1999: 89).  \n \nThe novel follows various characters as they strive to reinvent themselves as men \nagainst a backdrop of social change:  while Mary wants to be a boy rather than a girl, \nTimmy wants to be a vicar rather than a farmer, and Walter wants to be a country singer \nrather than a butcher. Mary has much in common with both men, whose vocations \nrepresent the \u2018sacred\u2019 and the \u2018country\u2019 of the novel\u2019s title, suggesting that the story is as \nmuch theirs as hers or, rather, that Mary\u2019s story is also their story. Just as Mary feels \ntrapped in a female body, so Timmy and Walter are trapped in traditional male roles and \nidentities. Both men are bound by patriarchal tradition. Sonny wants Timmy to inherit the \nfarm and Walter\u2019s father wants him to take over the family shop. Timmy expresses his \nsense of entrapment in his drawing of the 90\u00b0 angle, composed of a horizontal line that \nrepresents water (as a boy, Timmy hopes to become a professional swimmer) and a \nvertical line that represents praise (his other passion is devotional singing). When puberty \n  \n17 \n \nends his singing career and Sonny ends his swimming lessons, Timmy inserts an image \nof a figure trapped in the angle, bound by the words \u2018No way Out\u2019 to express his sense of \nsuffocation (p. 211). Haunted by the founder of the family business, who bears the \nmessage \u2018You are the last Loomis and you mustn\u2019t desert the meat\u2019 (p. 40), Walter feels \nsimilarly trapped: \u2018it seemed to him that his ancestor was\u2026pinning him down\u2019 (p. 40). \nTimmy hates the farm as much as Walter hates the shop and both men eventually quit \nhome to pursue \u2018a different life\u2019 (p. 242). The death of Sonny, who commits suicide on \nthe farm, and the death of Ernie (Walter\u2019s father), who bleeds to death in the shop after \nan accident with a meat cleaver, indicates that change is crucial to survival. \n \nMary and Timmy are linked by sanctity. Mary believes that she is a man as \nstrongly as Timmy believes in God, and her faith in her maleness is equally inviolable, or \nsacred. For Walter, country music is also sacred - the Ryman Auditorium is \u2018hallowed \nground\u2019 (p. 329) \u2013 but Mary and Walter are more closely connected by authenticity, \nwhich he pursues in country music and she (initially) believes resides in the substance of \nsex. Walter emphasises the authenticity of emotion expressed in his songs \u2013 \u2018Hillbillies \ndo not pretend\u2019 (p. 66) - and stresses that his cowboy outfit is made in Tennessee and \nhence \u2018the genuine thing\u2019 (p. 266). Yet Walter\u2019s pursuit of authenticity reveals that, like \nMary, he can only approximate his ideal self. Walter has to learn to yodel, to make a \nsound \u2018born in the mountains\u2019, in Suffolk where, as Pete notes, \u2018there were no mountains\u2019 \n(p. 38). Furthermore, according to Richard Peterson, the authenticity of country music is \na fabrication. Peterson demonstrates that the two personifications of country music, the \nhillbilly and the cowboy, were \u2018deliberately constructed images created selectively out of \n  \n18 \n \navailable symbolic resources and contemporary styles\u2019 and argues that these images were \ncarefully crafted by George Hay, creator of Grand Ole Opry, to fit a commercially \nsuccessful format (Peterson 1997: 68-9). Walter also demonstrates that naturalness is, as \nButler argues, an illusion created by repetition (Butler 1990: 33). He learns to yodel by \ncopying the singers he admires. The persistence of Walter\u2019s \u2018yodel-practice\u2019 wears out \nfour gramophone needles as he sings along to his Slim Whitman record, which he plays \n\u2018over and over\u2019 (p. 39). The considerable effort Walter exerts to achieve the sound that \nhis idols make \u2018effortlessly\u2019 reveals that naturalness is an affectation (p. 39).  \n \nTimmy and Walter are incoherently gendered figures that trouble the \nheteropatriarchal norms of identity and desire. Timmy\u2019s queerness is first suggested by \nthe name of the pesticide with which Mary tries to kill him: \u2018Flit\u2019, a synonym for a \nfeminine or gay man (p. 51). Gender ambiguity finds expression in his life-saving \ninstructions, which include \u2018drawings of a drowning person who could have been boy or \ngirl, child or man, it was hard to say\u2019 (p. 115). It is further suggested by Timmy\u2019s \nposition in the middle of his angle when he reimagines his parents as the two axes: \n\u2018Estelle the vertical line with her head in the sky somewhere. Sonny the horizontal, flat as \nthe fields, going nowhere but hopelessly on\u2019 (p. 212). When Timmy sings in the church \nchoir, Mary notes that his \u2018high voice\u2019 makes him sound \u2018like a girl\u2019 (p. 114; p. 213), and \nGarber\u2019s observation that religion is often regarded as \u2018unmanly\u2019 (Garber 1992: 211), \nsuggests that his role as a vicar further destabilises his gender. Endorsing this, Mary \nselects Reverend Geddis as a confidante on the grounds that \u2018he was a man who \nreminded me of a woman\u2019 (p. 130).  \n \n  \n19 \n \nLike Mary, Walter, who is bisexual, disrupts the binary categories of both gender \nand sexuality. Explaining that she perceives herself as male, Mary tells the agony aunt \nD\u2019Est\u00e9 Defoe \u2018I have never been sexually attracted to a man. I do not even dream of Sean \nConnery\u2019 (p. 199). Mary views her desire for women as evidence of her manhood but, \ndespite her reliance on heterosexual norms (the idea that \u2018real\u2019 men love women), her \ndesire problematises the categories \u2018heterosexual\u2019 and \u2018homosexual\u2019. While she dreams \nof \u2018pale-lipped black-eyed girls\u2019 (p. 179), she does not identify as a lesbian and ends her \nrelationship with Georgia on these grounds: \u2018she could only love women who loved men, \nnot women who loved women\u2019 (p. 225). Further, Mary\/Martin\u2019s love for Pearl remains \nconstant throughout the novel, demonstrating that sexuality is not determined by gender \nor sex. Walter\u2019s bisexuality likewise defies oppositional categories: he falls in love first \nwith Sandra, then Gilbert and finally Skippy Jean Maguire, whose gender-neutral pet-\nname, \u2018Sky\u2019 (p. 330), indicates a desire to transcend the binary categories of gender that \nunderpin compulsory heterosexuality.  \n \nAlthough discussing Gladys, a sexual partner, with Pete makes Walter feel \n\u2018mannish\u2019 (p. 124), the idea that heterosexuality affirms manhood is undercut by the \nsuggestion that he is not fully a man (\u2018-ish\u2019 meaning \u2018somewhat\u2019). The insecurity of \nWalter\u2019s manhood is also suggested by the fact that he styles himself as a \u2018cowboy\u2019 (p. \n265), a deeply ambivalent icon of masculinity. Whilst the cowboy is, on one hand, the \narchetype of American manhood, the model of heteronormative hypermasculinity that the \ncowboy represents is undercut by his flamboyant appearance and the homoerotic subtext \nof the predominantly male environment he occupies. As patriarchy typically endorses an \n  \n20 \n \ninjunction against male display and codes self-adornment as feminine, Walter\u2019s \n\u2018snakeskin and glitter\u2019 costumes and his \u2018rhinestone jacket\u2019 place him in a feminine \nposition (p. 342; p. 346). Walter is similarly feminised by his feelings, which patriarchy \nmakes taboo in men. Gilbert advises him \u2018not to feel\u2019 (p. 191), and when his father dies, \nrelations arrive to comfort his mother: \u2018Somehow it was she, only, who was considered to \nbe in need of comfort and they did not try to console Walter or Pete\u2019 (p. 93). Walter, \nhowever, is attracted to the outpouring of intense emotion that characterises country \nmusic. As he explains, hillbillies \u2018sing what they feel\u2019 (p. 66), and his own songs are full \nof passionate emotion. Furthermore, like the country singers he imitates, Walter sings in a \n\u2018falsetto\u2019 voice (p. 39). The multiple and alternating sounds of the yodel give symbolic \nexpression to the plurality and instability of Walter\u2019s identity and desire.  Although Pete \ncomments that the yodel \u2018was a sound born in the mountains, where a man could hear his \nown echo\u2019 (p. 38), the suggestion that yodeling confirms Walter\u2019s manhood is undercut \nby the fact that, according to Greek myth, Echo is female.  \n \nEven Sonny, who (as his name suggests) represents hegemonic masculinity, \nreveals the performativity of gender. Sonny is identified with America\u2019s most enduring \nmale icon, John Wayne. His hands are \u2018red and hard, like the old weathered hands of \nJohn Wayne\u2019 (p. 257), and he adopts the actor\u2019s most famous phrase: \u2018Darn right\u2019 (p. \n162). However, as Gary Wills shows, John Wayne\u2019s persona was as constructed as his \nemphatically (doubly) masculine name. In John Wayne\u2019s America (1997), Wills argues \nthat \u2018Wayne was not born Wayne. He had to be invented\u2019 (Wills 1997: 15), pointing out \nthat the actor Wayne never aspired to be a cowboy, hated horses and had to remind \n  \n21 \n \nhimself to say \u2018ain\u2019t\u2019 (Wills 1997: 31; 12). Wills also suggests that his famous walk was a \ncontrivance and concludes, \u2018his masculinity was a studied effect rather than something \nthat came naturally\u2019 (Wills 1997: 20-1). Disparities between Sonny and the screen idol \nconfirm that manhood is ceaselessly pursued but never fully possessed: struggling with a \npoor memory and a loveless marriage, Sonny notes with bitterness that \u2018John Wayne \ndidn\u2019t have holes in his past\u2019 and \u2018always had some black and white woman to kiss and to \nride with into the future\u2019 (p. 162).  Estelle has just as much trouble maintaining her \nlikeness to the actress Ava Gardner:  \u2018The perm was growing out of Estelle\u2019s hair. Half of \nit was straight and half curly. Ava Gardner had never looked like this\u2019 (p. 333). In this \nway, the novel illustrates that a subject \u2018never quite inhabits the ideal s\/he is compelled to \napproximate\u2019 (Butler 1993: 231). \n \nSonny\u2019s identification with John Wayne, born \u2018Marion Morrison\u2019, underlines the \nambivalence of his identity as a man. Sexual ambiguity is suggested by his damaged ear, \nlikened to \u2018coral\u2019 (p. 6), a hermaphroditic organism, and Sonny (like Mary) is  \ncharacterised by missing parts; he has lost part of his ear and a part of his watch that is \nsuggestive of symbolic castration: \u2018the minute hand had fallen off\u2019 (p. 3). As Sonny \nrepresents post-war men \u2013 the war \u2018damaged him, just like thousands of men had been \ndamaged in the war\u2019 (p. 35) \u2013 the novel suggests that neither masculinity nor maleness is \na sinecure for any man.  Indeed, the epigraph taken from T.S. Eliot\u2019s poem \u2018The Hollow \nMen\u2019 debunks the myth that sexual identity has substance, implying instead that all men \nare \u2018hollow\u2019.  \n \n  \n22 \n \nContesting Otherness \nWhile the dominant order seeks to maintain a regulatory regime of gender norms by \npresenting transsexuals as fakes, jokes, freaks or psychopaths, Tremain presents her FTM \nprotagonist as an ordinary man rather than an abject \u2018Other\u2019.3\n \n Although Timmy finds the \nbandages that Mary uses to bind her breasts \u2018revolting\u2019 (p. 116) and Sonny condemns her \nas an \u2018abomination\u2019 (p. 118), this attempt to \u2018Other\u2019 her is undercut by parallels between \nthem. While stressing the specificity of FTM transition, parallels between Mary and \nmany more characters point to universal aspects of her experience, which is also \nsuggested by the lyrics of Walter\u2019s song, \u2018Well, there\u2019s always something different hiding \n\/ There inside the something that you see!\u2019 (p. 220), and Cord\u2019s comment, \u2018We\u2019re all \nsomething else inside\u2019 (p. 313), which echoes Halbertsam\u2019s claim \u2018we are all \ntranssexuals\u2019 (Rivkin & Ryan 1998: 760).  \nLike Mary, most of the characters in the novel have a dual self or change their \nidentity. Harker, who believes in the transmigration of souls, believes that he was a \u2018nun\u2019 \nin a former life and undergoes a transition from confirmed bachelor to family man (p. \n110). Transformation is also suggested by his name, which he shares - along with an \ninterest in (cricket) bats - with the (feminine) young lawyer in Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula \n(1897). The \u2018worm\u2019 of inattention that Harker notices in himself likewise links him to \nMary as worms are hermaphrodites. Sonny\u2019s name is actually \u2018John\u2019 (p. 234), the fortune \nteller Madame Cleo\u2019s real name is \u2018Gladys Higgins\u2019 (p. 63), Mary\u2019s lover, Georgia \nDickins, is also the agony aunt \u2018D\u2019Este Defoe\u2019 (p. 198), Mary sends Pearl a record by Cat \nStevens, who later becomes a Muslim and changes his name to Yusuf Islam, Walter\u2019s \n  \n23 \n \nhero Slim Whitman was born Otis Dewey Whitman and his agent, Bentwater, has \nchanged his surname to \u2018Bliss\u2019 from \u2018LeQuaide\u2019 (p. 305), which denotes both gender \nambiguity (it combines, in French, the masculine definite article \u2018le\u2019 with a feminine \u2018e\u2019 \nending) and the fluidity of identity (it sounds like \u2018liquid\u2019).  \n \nThe duality of identity is reflected in the motif of doubleness: without glasses, \nMary sees \u2018people become two of themselves\u2019 (p. 13), Irene\u2019s idiosyncratic spelling \ncompels her to double consonants \u2013 \u2018You\u2019re becomming a strannger, Estelle\u2019 (p. 142) - \nand Walter forms a \u2018singing duo\u2019 with Sky (p. 343). The narrative form of the novel, \nwhich combines first and third person narration, is itself double and creates what \nBornstein calls a transgendered style, one characterised by collage, \u2018a cut and paste thing\u2019 \n(Bornstein 1994: 193). By continually switching from third to first person narration, the \ninstability of the narrative reflects the novel\u2019s key theme of change, which manifests \nitself in the lives of all characters, not just Mary: Gilbert Blakey drives a convertible, \nMary and Irene (Pearl\u2019s mother) watch the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, \nHarker transforms willow into cricket bats, and Livia turns horsehair into Christmas tree \ndecorations.  \n \nParallels between Mary and men disfigured by illness not only make Mary\u2019s \nexperience, which Harker fears \u2018no one\u2026will understand\u2019 (p. 207), accessible to non-\ntrans readers but also encourage identification and sympathy. The profound anguish that \nresults from the disparity between Mary\u2019s material and imagined body is mirrored closely \nin the experience of Cord, who is disfigured by Palsy to such an extent that he no longer \n  \n24 \n \nrecognises himself: \u2018His own image, in the glass of the medicine cabinet, was now an \nunrecognisable thing\u2019 (p. 134). As with gender dysphoria, the cause of palsy is unknown \nand cannot be explained by doctors. Despite this point of commonality, palsy is regarded \nas an illness that merits sympathy whereas transsexuality is stigmatized as a mental \ndisorder; Mary\u2019s doctor dismisses her insistence that she is a boy as \u2018delusion\u2019 (p. 152), \nand the novel ends in 1980, the year that the American Psychiatric Association added \ntranssexuality to its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Registered Mental Disorders.  \n \nPete also experiences a painful split between his internal and external selves \nwhich, like his eyes, do not align.  When he meets an attractive woman in a bar, Pete \nknows that her gaze slides over him because his wandering eye make him \u2018ugly\u2019 (p. 111). \nLike Mary, Pete wants others to see him as he sees himself and is determined \u2018to bring \nthis girl around to his way of seeing himself\u2019 (p. 112). The tumour that eats away Pete\u2019s \nnose also links him to Mary (and Sonny) through the motif of missing parts because the \nnose often represents the penis. By aligning Mary with men disfigured by illness, \nTremain implicitly presents the FTM\u2019s female body as a deformity that sex reassignment \ncan correct. Likewise, the bandages that Mary uses to bind her breasts suggest healing. \nThus, in contrast to critics like Sheila Jeffries (2003), who considers FTM transsexuality \na form of violence against women and views sex change operations as a mutilation of the \nbody, Tremain presents sex reassignment as therapy rather than pathology.4\n \n  \nThe novel challenges the classification of transsexuality as a mental disorder by \npresenting Mary alongside a number of eccentric or mentally unstable characters. Harker \n  \n25 \n \nwrites in \u2018green ink\u2019 (p. 53), the colour said to characterise crank letters, and the sign \nadvertising his business - \u2018Harker\u2019s Bats\u2019 (p. 15) - also calls his sanity into question \n(\u2018batty\u2019 being a synonym for \u2018crazy\u2019). Georgia is \u2018elsewhere in her mind\u2019 (p. 225) and, \nhemmed in by turkeys, Pete feels he is \u2018going mad\u2019 (p. 347). Moreover, Mary seems \nperfectly sane in comparison to Sonny, who believes that she is using \u2018deadly magic\u2019 to \nruin the farm and (p. 163), in the face of all evidence to the contrary, desperately clings to \nthe belief that Timmy will return to save it. Furthermore, Estelle is committed to a mental \nhospital at various points in the narrative and remains there at the novel\u2019s close. As \nSonny and Estelle epitomise the dominant order\u2019s gender ideal in their likeness to John \nWayne and Ava Gardner, the fact that they both go mad highlights the harm caused by a \nbinary sex-gender system and locates pathology in heteropatriarchy rather than \ntranssexuality.  \n \nTremain also contests the Otherness of the FTM by presenting transsexuality as \nsacred. The epigraph taken from a poem by St. John of the Cross \u2013 \u2018I live without \ninhabiting Myself\u2019 \u2013 positions Mary as a holy figure by aligning the experience of \nalienation, that stems from the unhomeliness of her own body, with that of a saint. Her \nsacred status is also suggested by her adopted name, Mary Martin, which is not only the \nname of the actress who played Peter Pan but also that of a radical seventeenth century \nRoman Catholic nun. Furthermore, Mary\u2019s name invokes Christ\u2019s mother, who is central \nto a biblical tradition that transforms holy women into men. As Elizabeth Castelli has \nshown, this tradition originates in the Gospel of Thomas, where Christ insists that he will \nmake Mary male so that she can remain among the disciples (Castelli 1991: 33). \n  \n26 \n \nParalleling her transition from female to male, if Mary is first associated with Christ\u2019s \nmother, the \u2018Virgin Mary\u2019 (p. 153), she is later aligned with Christ himself. When Mary\u2019s \nfriends Rob and Tony visit her three days after a bilateral mastectomy, Rob remarks, \n\u2018This is your resurrection, man\u2019 (p. 289). The religious idiom recalls Jan Morris\u2019s \ntranssexual autobiography Conundrum (1974), which Stone describes as an \u2018almost \nreligious narrative of transformation\u2019 (Stone 1991: 281). By presenting her protagonist as \na sacred figure, Tremain implicitly challenges the view that transsexuals are \u2018sick\u2019 and \n\u2018sinful\u2019 (Rubin 1992: 282).  \n \nAlthough it opens in 1952, the year, according to D\u2019Este Defoe, that the first sex \nchange operation was performed (p. 200), allusions to Biblical and canonical literary \ntexts that highlight the incoherence of gender and sexual identity offer a reminder that \nqueer identities are not a modern phenomenon.5 As well as studying Hamlet, Mary reads \nMacbeth, another play that articulates her desire to change sex. Lady Macbeth pleads to \nbe transformed into a man: \u2018unsex me here\u2019 (I, v, 42). Moreover, according to Jarold \nRamsey, Macbeth exposes manhood as \u2018unfixed\u2019, \u2018evolving\u2019 and \u2018unappealable\u2019 \n(Ramsey 1973: 286). Manhood is rendered \u2018meaningless\u2019 because the play demonstrates \nthat there is \u2018no intrinsic distinction, no fundamental basis of identity to be had in \ndeclaring one\u2019s male gender\u2019 (Ramsey 1973: 287; 291). The Greek caf\u00e9 that Mary \nfrequents in London invokes a tradition of Greek myths populated by queer figures such \nas Hermaphroditus (an intersex figure) and Tiresias (who changes sex). The realization \nthat subjects who defy the binary categories of gender and sexual identity have a long \nhistory challenges the pathologisation of transsexuality as abnormal. As Mary tells \n  \n27 \n \nWalter, \u2018It\u2019s in the Talmud. In the Bible, even. It\u2019s been known since time began\u2019 (p. \n268).  \n \nWhile Tremain contests the Otherness of the transsexual subject, she also contests \nthe Otherness of women. Estelle is clearly dissatisfied with her status as the second sex, \nwhich limits her role to that of wife and mother. Playing What\u2019s My Line?, Estelle \nrealises that  \u2018None of the women, including me, had ever been anything. We\u2019d never had \na line. Being a mother and a wife is not a line\u2019 (p. 82). Her dream of boarding a train, \n\u2018leaving Mary behind on the platform\u2019 (p. 141), suggests a desire to escape marriage and \nmotherhood. Estelle\u2019s aversion to weddings articulates her distaste for marriage -  \n\u2018Weddings make me constipated\u2019 (p. 317) - and her concern that Pearl will abandon her \ncareer plans after marrying Timmy indicate the importance that she places on female \nindependence. Mary is equally aware of the limited opportunities available to women and \nsaddened by the absence of women in Livia\u2019s Dictionary of Inventions; significantly, the \none woman listed is unmarried: \u2018Miss Glover\u2019 (p. 167 emphasis added). Mary is also \ntroubled by women\u2019s subordinate social position: she resents the privileges that Timmy \nenjoys (Sonny longs for a son and then gives him preferential treatment) and is appalled \nby Lyndsey\u2019s desire to \u2018submit\u2019 to her fianc\u00e9, Ranulph (p. 149). However, Mary\u2019s wish to \nchange sex is not an attempt to escape the social disadvantages of womanhood. As she \ntells her friend Rob, \u2018Nothing is wrong with being a woman. It\u2019s only that I\u2019m not one\u2019 \n(p. 242). Mary and Estelle are linked by being the only two characters in the novel who \nspeak in the first person. By giving a voice to members of two marginalised social groups \nthat have been historically voiceless (women and transsexuals), Tremain suggests that \n  \n28 \n \ntheir struggles for social justice are connected. Although the queer deconstruction of \nidentity has been viewed as incompatible with the feminist critique of female oppression, \nTremain points to the convergence of feminist and queer politics: Mary and Estelle are \nboth trapped by womanhood, albeit in different ways.  \n \nHowever, the novel suggests that it is not only women who will benefit from a \nqueer deconstruction of heteropatriarchal gender norms. While Mary fears being \n\u2018loathed\u2019 for her transsexuality (p. 129), a regulatory framework that rewards legitimacy \nwith social acceptance and punishes illegitimacy with social stigma affects several \ncharacters in the novel adversely. There is a suggestion that Pearl does not win the \nBeautiful Baby Contest because she is \u2018illegitimate\u2019 (p. 8), Irene struggles to find a job \nbecause she is an unmarried mother, Harker fears that Irene\u2019s pregnancy will put him \namong the \u2018outcasts\u2019 (p. 74), and Walter worries that his love for Gilbert will make him \nan \u2018outcast\u2019 too (p. 190). Tremain\u2019s critique of the boundaries that construct Otherness is \ntherefore liberating for all subjects who defy social norms, not just transsexuals.  \n \nEngland and Englishness \nWhile the \u2018sacred country\u2019 of the novel\u2019s title can be read as manhood, it also connotes \nEngland, which is often represented as a land of sacred sites. Reflecting this, when \nEstelle tries to add up everything in England, she begins with \u2018churches\u2019 (p. 139). \nTremain\u2019s reassessment of gender and sexual identity is accompanied by a critical \nexamination of Englishness, which confirms Eve Kosofksy Sedgwick\u2019s assertion that \u2018a \nlot of the most exciting recent work around \u201cqueer\u201d spins the term outward along \n  \n29 \n \ndimensions that can\u2019t be subsumed under gender and sexuality at all: all the ways that \nrace, ethnicity, postcolonial nationality criss-cross with the these and other identity-\nconstituting, identity-fracturing, discourses, for example\u2019 (Sedgwick 1993: 8-9). The \npost-war period that Tremain charts witnessed major shifts in perceptions of England and \nEnglishness. As Jeremy Paxman argues, \u2018the war and its immediate aftermath are the last \ntime in living memory when the English had a clear and positive sense of themselves\u2019 \n(Paxman 1998: 2). Significantly, the novel opens in 1952, the year of the Suez Crisis, \nwhich marked England\u2019s decline as a dominant world power: after Suez, Margaret \nBlakey weeps for England and \u2018a greatness that was past\u2019 (p. 67), and in the States, \nWalter\u2019s declaration of Englishness is met with incredulity: \u2018You mean to tell me that \nEngland\u2019s still there?\u2019 (p. 304). The crisis in Englishness intersects with, and is reflected \nby, the crisis in gender and sexual identity depicted in the novel. \n \nSacred Country illustrates that, like gender and sex, Englishness is a construct. \nCord, who holds an essentialist view of national identity, promulgates reductive racial, as \nwell as national, stereotypes: \u2018The English are damned nifty at drill. Drill is in us, like \ndance is in the African. No one can say why, but it\u2019s true\u2019 (p. 261). However, \ncontradicting Cord, the novel suggests that Englishness is invented rather than innate. \nWhile Irene compares herself to Celia Johnson, the revelation that she has \u2018rehearsed\u2019 (p. \n73) the lines that make her sound like this \u2018icon of Englishness\u2019 points to the fabrication \nof national identity (Light 1991: 208). Similarly, reflecting Homi Bhabha\u2019s assertion that \nthe nation is a discursive construct or narrative strategy (Bhabha 1994: 140), that nation \nis the product of narration, the woman with whom Walter stays when he first moves to \n  \n30 \n \nthe States knows England primarily through \u2018Jeeves stories\u2019 (p. 302). The novel further \nchallenges essentialism by suggesting that national identity is imaginary, an idea or state \nof mind. Confirming that England is, as Benedict Anderson notes, an \u2018imagined \ncommunity\u2019 (1983), Walter finds the \u2018solidity\u2019 of London \u2018unfamiliar\u2019 and \u2018foreign\u2019 (p. \n216). When Margaret Blakey discovers that her house is slowly falling into the sea, she \nmoves her bedroom from the front to the back of the house so that instead of looking at \nthe encroaching sea, she sees her ideal image of England \u2013 a pastoral idyll consisting of \nfields, a wood and a church spire: \u2018She liked this landscape. She could imagine the rest of \nEngland spreading out and on beyond the spire. Out and on\u2019 (p. 251). However, Sonny\u2019s \nnew combine harvester, plans for the trunk road and the aluminium sheds that make up \nGrace Loomis\u2019s expanding empire of \u2018hen factories\u2019 suggest that the England Margaret \ncherishes is more imaginary than real (p. 285). The discrepancy between imagination and \nreality is likewise indicated by the distance between Irene and Celia Johnson: Irene \nidentifies herself with the star of Brief Encounter (1945), a film about a woman who \nresists sexual transgression, in the very moment that she informs Harker (to whom she is \nnot married) that she is pregnant.   \n \nTremain also demonstrates that, like gender and sexual identity, Englishness is \nconstructed in opposition to an \u2018Other\u2019. Watching the World Cup, Estelle states, \u2018We sit \nin the dark and chant with the crowd: \u2018England! \u2013 England! \u2013 England! And we have new \nenemies: their names are Pele and Jairzinho and Eusebio and de Michele and Weber and \nBeckenbauer\u2019 (p. 186). However, the novel challenges a definition of Englishness that \nrests on the disavowal of difference. When Mary first arrives in London, she puts up \n  \n31 \n \npostcards of national monuments such as the Tower of London in her room but, \nchallenging stereotypical images of England, she soon feels most at home in the Greek \ncaf\u00e9: \u2018it\u2019s a strange thing, but it\u2019s in the Greek cafe, which is called Zorba\u2019s, that I have \nthis strong sense of being in London and not just in it any more but becoming part of it\u2019 \n(p. 182). The myth of an authentic or pure English national identity is subverted by other \nexamples of hybridity. The American Judge Riveaux explains that his wife liked to see \nShakespeare in England because \u2018she liked a thing to be authentic\u2019 (p. 351). However, the \n\u2018larder full of \u2018Cooper\u2019s Oxford Marmalade\u2019 that he cites as evidence that she is an \n\u2018anglophile\u2019 calls the notion of authenticity into question as this quintessentially English \nmarmalade is made with oranges imported from Seville.  \n \nAs well as highlighting parallels between the construction of gender and national \nidentity, Sacred Country indicates that national identity is gendered. Anne McClintock \nargues that dominant representations of nation depend on, and institutionalise, gender \ndifference (McClintock 1995: 353). Her observation that the nation is often \nmetaphorically figured as a family indicates that sexuality is equally integral to dominant \nconceptions of nation, which is a heteropatriarchal concept (McClintock 1995: 360). \nSonny and Estelle demonstrate the different roles assigned to women and men: he \ndefends the nation (he has fought in World War II), she produces and reproduces it (she \nbears two children and makes a \u2018Union Jack\u2019 [p. 283]). The novel also illustrates that \nmen are \u2018contiguous with the nation as a whole\u2019 (McClintock 1995: 355): Harker is \nassociated with the English national sport (he makes cricket bats), Milo, Estelle\u2019s first \nlove, \u2018was made of England\u2019 (p. 44), and Beales\u2019s smile is \u2018like English spring sunlight\u2019 \n  \n32 \n \n(p. 201). As Giles and Middleton note, the idea that \u2018to be English is to be an \nEnglishman\u2019 excludes women (Giles and Middleton 1995: 25). This is indicated by \nLivia\u2019s love of gliding: she \u2018liked to see England from above, neat and flat, like a map of \nitself\u2019 (p. 83), suggesting that she felt distanced or separate from the nation. Likewise, \nEstelle loves watching American television shows and fantasises about running away to \nScotland.   \n \nThe novel suggests that it is not only women who are excluded from dominant \nconceptions of nation but also transsexuals. Tremain\u2019s use of landscape as a trope for \nsexual identity indicates that bodies and nations are conflated, the borders of both being \narbitrary but scrupulously patrolled and endorsed by the dominant order. Illustrating this, \nafter a double mastectomy, the terms used to describe Mary\u2019s body, \u2018neat and flat\u2019 (p. \n288), echo those used to describe England as seen from Livia\u2019s glider.  Noting that \n\u2018intelligible and legible bodies reflect, define and regulate the nation as a boundaried \npolitical geography\u2019 (Boyd 2006: 420), Nan Alamilla Boyd proposes that \u2018the body \npolitic (the nation) exists for intelligible bodies\u2019 (Boyd 2006: 431). Consequently, Mary\u2019s \nqueer body renders identification with England problematic: she wears a scarf patterned \nwith \u2018windmills and blue Dutchmen\u2019 (p. 4), keeps her sweets in a tin that has \u2018a picture of \na Swiss chalet on it\u2019 (pp. 14-15), imagines a former life as The Great Camillo (an Italian \nname), selects Hitler as an example of a good leader (p. 128), and smokes French \ncigarettes (p. 235). In addition, Mary moves from the country to the city, rejecting the \nrural landscape that is seen as synonymous with England for London, traditionally home \nto exiles and \u00e9migr\u00e9s like Rob, her South African friend. Cord wishes that he could give \n  \n33 \n \nMary \u2018the chance to look out and away from England into another world\u2019 (p. 137), Sterns \nadvises Mary to leave the country and broaden her horizons - \u2018Remind yourself how \nsmall England is and how vast all the rest\u2019 (p. 316) - and Mary chooses self-imposed \nexile when she moves to the States. \n \nHowever, Boyd notes that bodies reflect \u2018both nationalism and resistant social \nmovements\u2019, and stresses that unintelligible bodies possess \u2018radical possibility\u2019 (Boyd \n2006: 420-1). As queer bodies \u2018undermine the recognition and comradeship central to \nnational unity\u2019 (Boyd 2006: 421), they threaten nationhood. Sacred Country opens with \nan image of a common culture - \u2018the nation fell silent for two minutes in honour of the \ndead king\u2019 (p. 3) - but immediately subverts the myth of national unity: because Sonny\u2019s \nwatch is broken, the Ward family\u2019s silence is \u2018not properly synchronised with that of the \nnation\u2019 (p. 4). The novel offers a further critique of national unity when Estelle celebrates \nEngland\u2019s 1966 World Cup victory with fellow residents of  the \u2018loony bin\u2019 (p. 55), \nimplying that patriotism is a form of madness: \u2018all the mad of the shires and the counties \nare shouting and weeping their hearts dry\u2019 (p. 190). The incoherence of Mary\u2019s sexual \nidentity indicates that transsexuality likewise poses a significant threat to national unity. \nAs Boyd concludes, by upsetting a fixed relationship between gender, sex and sexuality, \ntranssexual bodies \u2018reterritorialize national geographies\u2019 (Boyd 2006: 420).      \n \nIn conclusion, even though, as Mary notes, \u2018Some subjects are not supposed to be \ndebated\u2019 (p. 130), Sacred Country refuses to let manhood remain a sacred cow. The \nchallenge that FTM transsexuality poses to dominant conceptions of manhood as natural, \n  \n34 \n \nself-evident and inviolable explains why it remains invisible or stigmatized. \nTranssexuality threatens the established order because it unsettles the stable ground of \ngender and challenges the binary categories that underpin heteropatriarchy and \nnationalism. By exploring what Stone calls the transsexual\u2019s \u2018potential for productive \ndisruption of structured sexualities\u2019 (Stone 1991: 296), and by drawing parallels between \nthe FTM and characters designated male at birth, Tremain challenges enduring and \noppressive myths about gender and sex, most notably the belief that some bodies are \nmore authentic or legitimate - and, consequently, that some bodies matter  - more than \nothers.  \n \n \n \n  \n35 \n \nWorks Cited \n \nAnderson, Benedict (1983), Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origins and  \n Spread of Nationalism, London: Verso.  \nBailey, J.
