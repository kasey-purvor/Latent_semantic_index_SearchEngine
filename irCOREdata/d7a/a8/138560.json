Achieving the dual\ntargets of lower cost and higher service has implications for every stage in the supply\nchain and in particular for distribution centre operations.\nThis paper sets out to identify the extent to which organisations are adjusting their\ndistribution centre operations to match current supply chain concepts. Based on a\nsurvey of distribution centres in the U.K., the paper explores the roles that these\nfacilities currently play and seeks to gauge the extent to which modern supply chain\ntheory and distribution centre operations are aligned.\nThis paper examines the current role of large distribution centres within the U.K. and,\nin particular, explores the extent to which these facilities are aligned to modern supply\nchain concepts.\nThe first section of the paper reviews the development of supply chain thinking\nduring the past few decades, highlighting the perceived changes in the roles of\ndistribution centres as new supply chain concepts have developed.\n4The second section describes the research method. This is chiefly based on a postal\nsurvey of U.K. distribution centre managers, but also draws on some supplementary\ninformation. The results of the research are presented in the third section.\nFinally, conclusions are drawn from the results, examining whether large distribution\ncentres in the U.K. currently exhibit the characteristics that may be expected from the\nimplementation of modern supply chain concepts. Future challenges for distribution\ncentres are examined and areas of further work are identified.\nThe development of the supply chain concept\nThe development of the supply chain concept has been characterised by the increasing\ndegree of organisational integration that has been proposed. For example, La Londe\ndescribes the stages as being: physical distribution integration, internal linkages and\nthen external linkages [1]. Similarly for individual firms, Stevens described a\nbaseline of functional excellence, followed by the three stages of functional\nintegration, internal integration and external integration, as shown in Figure 1 [2].\nPLACE FIGURE 1 HERE\nThe importance of warehousing theory within the context of functional excellence is\nfairly self-evident and there is a wide range of publications that address the ways in\n5which that activity can be optimised. They include fairly comprehensive books on the\nsubject [3], as well as numerous journal articles on particular aspects of warehousing\ntheory [4].\nThe next stage, physical distribution integration, recognised the need for an integrated\ndistribution management structure [5]. This period was largely characterised by cost\ntrade-offs, the total-cost concept and the total-system approach [6]. Under these\ntheories, decisions were taken on the basis of the lowest overall distribution costs,\nincluding storage, inventory, transportation, and order processing costs. Although this\nperiod is largely regarded as taking place in the 1950s and 1960s, there is one\nreference traced back as far as 1844 [7] and it is probable that the cost trade-off\nconcept has been practised in logistics for some considerable time. Within this\nconcept, warehousing is a key cost element. The theories underpinning warehousing\nfunctional excellence are therefore of key importance in order to identify the costs for\nthe various storage and inventory holding alternatives being traded-off with\ntransportation and order processing costs. The role of the warehouse as a\nstockholding point was not fundamentally changed by this concept, although the full\ncosts of storage and inventory were being recognised for the first time in many\norganisations.\nThe next stage was that of internal integration, where a much wider view was taken\nencompassing functions outside physical distribution such as marketing and\nmanufacturing. This led to suggestions that the total cost approach should be\nsuperseded by a total profit approach [8]. Under this concept, service levels such as\nlead times were viewed as negotiable and therefore part of supply chain management\n6thinking [9]. Also, the parallel evolution of supply chain management from the\nviewpoint of purchasing and supply activities was being integrated with distribution\n[10]. This led to considerable attention on how these functions should work together,\nwhich tended to overshadow the changing roles of distribution centres.\nThis tendency has continued through the latest stage of supply chain evolution,\nnamely external integration. This stage is where the significance of the whole supply\nchain, or network, is recognised, all the way from the extraction of raw materials to\nthe final use by the end consumer, and also extending to reverse flows [11]. The\ndegree of integration with suppliers and customers has been shown to be strongly\nassociated with high levels of performance [12]. One of the key concepts of this stage\nhas been to substitute information for inventory [13]. This has resulted in a\ndiminution of the perceived role of warehouses within modern supply chains.\nThe role of distribution centres\nThere is evidence that, paradoxically, this development in supply chain management\nthinking has not been extended fully into the area of distribution centre design. In\nfact, there is some evidence that most books on supply chain strategy do not mention\nwarehousing, or only mention it in passing and, similarly, books on warehousing tend\nnot to put warehousing concepts in the context of supply chain strategy [14]. There\nhas thus been a separation of supply chain theory from warehousing theory, with\ndifferent books and journal articles addressing each area separately. Even where\nbooks do cover both aspects, the different chapters are normally not closely linked.\n7This separation has not however been total. This can be seen by examining the\nliterature on two classifications of supply chain strategy that have been developed:\nnamely, supply-focus and demand-focus strategies [15]. These correspond broadly to\nthe cost and service foci that characterise lean and agile concepts respectively [16].\nThe lean concept is primarily centred around the elimination of supply chain waste\nwhich may manifest itself in terms of, for example, excess resources, high levels of\ninventory or unnecessarily long lead times. Agility, on the other hand, aims to take\nadvantage of volatile market places and thus the ability to respond rapidly to market\nopportunities is the critical factor. Lean and agile concepts are not mutually exclusive\nand may, in fact, be combined effectively to offer, for example, a high volume lean\nsupply pipeline supported by agile pipelines for surges in demand and for special\nproducts [17]. Although these two concepts have different emphases in terms of cost\nand service, there are common themes and these have significant implications for the\nrole and design of distribution centres. These may be summarised as follows:\nInventory holdings: There appears to be a general consensus that inventory should\nbe minimised in supply chains. Inventories have been described as balancing\nmechanisms of last resort [18]. The true cost of inventory is now recognised\nincluding for example the cost of obsolescence, deterioration, stock losses and\ninsurance [19], as well as inventory being an impediment to customer responsiveness\nand often leading to price mark-downs. In an agile supply chain, inventory is held at\nfew echelons, if at all [20]. The goods pass through the supply chain quickly so that\ncompanies can respond rapidly to exploit market-place demand [21], without the risk\nof holding inventories of goods that may become obsolete. This view is reinforced as\n8being a necessary, although not the only, condition for a supply chain to be agile [22].\nSimilarly, in lean supply chains low inventory levels are regarded as a key element in\nreducing costs and eliminating waste [23]. However, there is some recognition of the\nneed for inventory in modern supply chains. For example, strategic inventory may act\nas a decoupling point between lean manufacturing and an agile supply chain [24]. It\nis also acknowledged that high levels of availability are imperative when faced with\nvolatile markets [25] and this implies holding some type of inventory. Furthermore,\nglobal sourcing has led to lengthy and uncertain international pipelines, which tend to\nlead to higher inventories [26].\nCustomer lead times: Whether inventory is held or not, short lead times from the\nreceipt of customer order to delivery are regarded as critical, particularly in agile\nsupply chains where service is regarded as an order winner [27]. These short lead\ntimes are essential to enable agile supply chains to respond to volatile demand\npatterns and to exploit market opportunities as soon as they arise. Similarly, in lean\nsupply chains a reduction in lead times is generally viewed as being an important\nelement in the elimination of waste. Thus, the proper reengineering of supply chains\nto reduce lead times is directly associated with cost reduction [28].\n9Inventory and distribution centre strategies\nIn response to these pressures of lower inventory levels and reduced lead times, the\nliterature on modern supply chain concepts offers the following possible solutions\nwithin distribution centres:\nService level segmentation: Aligning logistics operations with customer segments is\nrecognised as an important means to achieving profit growth [29]. The identification\nof customer value is a key first step [30], and this then enables supply chain strategies\nto be developed for each customer group, or down to individual customer level [31].\nThere is now a general acceptance that a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d supply chain is not\nsufficient and that different supply chains need to be designed for each market sector.\nFor example, the recognition of cost and service as market winners in lean and agile\nsupply chains respectively may lead to different order lead times being provided in\neach segment.\nPostponement: When inventory is held within an agile approach, the majority may\nbe held as work-in progress awaiting build \/ configuration instructions from the final\ncustomer [32]. This is often referred to as postponement [33] or postponed fulfillment\n[34]. By postponing product differentiation, supply chains are able to respond to\nprecise market demands, rather than supplying too many items of one particular\nproduct line (leading to excess inventories) or too few of another line (leading to\nservice failures). Not only is the service element of postponement important under\nthe agile concept but the cost element (i.e. reduced inventories) is also important\nwithin the lean concept. Postponement can take place at various points in the supply\n10\nchain but the warehouse is viewed as a key option as it is often the last point in the\nsupply chain prior to despatch to the customer [35].\nCross docking: This is where goods move through a warehouse without being put\ninto storage [36]. Under agile supply chains, distribution is frequently regarded as\ntaking place directly to the final customer [37] or via cross docking and in transit\nmerging [38]. It is recognised that cross docking can lead to a reduction of order\ncycle time, thereby improving the flexibility and responsiveness of the distribution\nnetwork [39]. Cross docking may also occur for goods arriving from distribution\ncentres holding central inventories of slow moving goods [40] or from warehouses at\nthe same echelon level [41]. The latter is in line with the concept of virtual inventory,\nwhereby all distribution centre inventories are controlled as one and goods moved to\nwhere they are needed [42]. Postponement and cross docking may be combined\ntogether in the concept of \u201cflow through distribution\u201d [43], whereby value added\nservices are performed as products continuously flow through a warehouse. The\ncurrent interest in cross docking has been substantiated by a UK survey in the retail\ngrocery logistics sector, which placed this as one of the most important changes likely\nto occur in transport and warehousing practice [44]. Cross docking can have\nsignificant implications in terms of warehouse design. For example, it implies the\nrapid movement of goods from inbound vehicles to outbound vehicles. Thus, the\ninbound and outbound docks either need to be adjacent to each other on the same face\nof the warehouse or they need to be on two faces of the warehouse that are very close\ntogether. The former may be suitable where cross-docking is occurring within a\nwarehouse that is holding inventories of other product lines (giving a general U-shape\nflow) and the latter is likely to be appropriate in a warehouse which is primarily\n11\nundertaking cross docking (normally being designed as a long, thin warehouse with\nnumerous docks on the two long sides) [45]. Goods need to be sorted, or at least\nmarshalled, between the two sets of vehicles and this may be undertaken either\nconventionally (e.g. with powered pallet trucks) or using automated equipment (e.g.\nsorters). Both types of solution are normally performed at ground level and thus\nrequire low bay warehousing, rather than high-bay facilities which are often used for\ninventory-holding warehouses [46].\nThird party logistics providers: The achievement of higher levels of supply chain\nagility requires different organisational models. Terms such as the extended\nenterprise [47], organisational agility [48], a virtual corporation [49], virtual teaming\n[50] or fluid clusters [51] imply the type of organisational networks that may need to\nbe created. As third-party logistics providers operate throughout the supply chain,\nthey are regarded as being in a good position to coordinate and integrate capabilities\nto provide a flexible and dynamic supply chain network [52]. Thus, management\nexpertise, physical assets, staffing and information systems may be brought to bear on\na particular operation (or, equally, switched away from an operation) more rapidly\nthan is possible for an individual manufacturer or retailer. These capabilities may\napply to information resources (e.g. track and trace systems) as well as physical\nresources. The degree of flexibility is likely to be particularly marked in the case of\nshared-user facilities, where only fairly short commitments to staff levels and space\nmay be required, as compared to dedicated facilities, where the third-party logistics\nproviders may seek to align the contract length more closely to the life of the assets.\nThe use of third party logistics providers is also compatible with lean supply chains as\n12\nreduced supply chain costs is one of the most frequently cited benefits of outsourcing\nlogistics [53].\nThe purpose of this paper is to explore the extent to which the above pressures and\nproposed solutions are actually reflected in the operations of large distribution centres\nwithin the United Kingdom.\nResearch method\nThe research was based on a database of UK warehouses compiled by King Sturge\n(international property consultants) in order to monitor developments in the market.\nAdditional information has been obtained from publicly available sources where\nappropriate.\nThe warehouse database comprised 340 warehouses over 100,000 square feet in size,\nbuilt and \u201ctaken up\u201d in the period 1995 to 2001. The definition of \u201ctaken up\u201d for this\npurpose is the acquisition of the warehouses for use by end users and thus excludes\nany speculative developments remaining empty. Later transactions were excluded, as\nthe warehouses may not have been fully operational at the time of the survey (late\n2002-early 2003). From this database, 250 contacts were derived on the basis of those\nfacilities where full postal address details could be readily obtained using such\ntechniques as Internet searches and telephone calls to company head offices. In most\ncases a named individual (normally the warehouse manager) was identified.\n13\nA postal survey form was addressed to the named individual for each site on the\ndatabase. A 20% response rate was achieved, giving 50 completed forms. From\nthese, 5 were then discounted as being unusable, chiefly because they fell outside the\noriginal parameters of size and date. Thus, 45 usable survey forms acted as the basis\nof analysis.\nThese 45 usable responses came from warehouses totalling 12.2 million square feet,\nrepresenting 16% of all new warehouses of this size built and \u201ctaken up\u201d during the\nperiod 1995 \u2013 2001.\nThese 45 responses were from distribution centres operated by, or on behalf of,\ncompanies in the industry sectors shown in Table 1. Thus, the responses represent a\ncross-section across a number of sectors.\nPLACE TABLE 1 HERE\nThe category shown as \u201cshared user facilities\u201d represent distribution centres operated\nby third party logistics companies handling goods for a variety of different\ncompanies. Where a dedicated facility is operated by a third party logistics company,\nthis is shown in the table under the relevant industry of the client company.\nThe survey questionnaire asked the Distribution Centre Managers either to insert\nspecific data (e.g. percentage of throughput cross-docked) or to select from a series of\n14\noptions (e.g. for order lead time: same day, next day, 2-5 days, etc). The relevant\nquestions from the survey form are shown in the Appendix.\nResults\nThe research results are presented under each of the six headings identified from the\nliterature.\ni Inventory levels\nAn analysis of all distribution centres in the database indicates that the take-up (i.e.\noccupation) of large warehouses, has been increasing in recent years, as shown in\nFigure 2. The pronounced peak in 2001 was due to a number of initiatives occurring\nat the same time, including distribution centres for Argos, Asda, Ikea, Sainsbury\u2019s and\nSomerfield (all major retailers).\nPLACE FIGURE 2 HERE\nThis is not necessarily representative of general warehousing trends as the figures\nonly include warehouses of 100,000 sq. ft. or over in size. These larger warehouses\nmay of course be replacing a number of smaller warehouses. In fact, 60% of the\n15\nwarehouses were replacing smaller sites. However, the figures do indicate an\nincreasing use of large distribution centres in today\u2019s supply chains.\nOverall levels of inventory for UK industry are published by the Office for National\nStatistics and these indicate that the ratio of total inventories to Gross Domestic\nProduct has remained fairly constant in recent years (see Figure 3).\nPLACE FIGURE 3 HERE\nIn fact, as Gross Domestic Product has been growing (by about 2.8% per annum)\nduring this period, the level of total inventory in the economy has been growing in\nreal terms. These figures reflect a similar pattern to that experienced in the USA\nduring most of the 1990\u2019s [56].\nThe national statistics on inventory ratios, as well as the take-up of large warehouses,\nraise some doubts as to whether inventories are being driven down, as would be\nassociated with many modern supply chain concepts.\nThe survey results indicate that the average level of inventory holding in large\ndistribution centres is 7.5 weeks. Whilst 16% of the respondents reported an\ninventory holding of less than 2 weeks (and a similar number between 2 and 3.9\nweeks), over one quarter reported a holding of 12 weeks inventory or more. The full\n16\nbreakdown is shown in Figure 4. This provides some indication as to the levels of\ninventory being held in large distribution centres in the U.K.\nPLACE FIGURE 4 HERE\nThe indications from this research are that, although there are some \u201cfast throughput\u201d\nwarehouses, there are also significant inventory holdings of goods in some facilities.\nThe latter may be in line with the concepts of \u201cdecoupling\u201d points and global supply\nlines, mentioned in the literature. In particular, there has been a switch in recent years\nfrom sourcing materials and products from UK suppliers to sourcing globally [57].\nThis has lengthened supply chains considerably leading to increases in safety stocks\nto cater for the potential variability in demand during the longer lead times, as well as\nfor variations in shipping times. This switch to global sourcing is reflected in the\ngrowth of container traffic at UK ports, measured in TEUs (twenty foot equivalent\nunits). This rose by 6.8% per annum in the period 1991 to 1999 (after which the\nrecording base was changed slightly) [58], compared to a growth in real Gross\nDomestic Product of about 2.7% during the same period.\nii Order lead times\nWithin the literature there is general agreement that short order lead times are\nfrequently a key service level factor, particularly in agile supply chains. Figure 5\nshows the survey findings in this regard. As the survey only concerned distribution\ncentre operations, lead time was defined in this context as the length of time from the\n17\nreceipt of customer order to despatch. Multiple answers were allowed as many\ndistribution centres provide different lead times to the various market segments that\nthey serve.\nPLACE FIGURE 5 HERE\nThis indicates that 20% of distribution centres provide a same day lead time and 69%\na next day lead time. Some of the sites were offering both same day and next day\nservice and, hence, the total percentage offering a same and\/or next day lead time\namounts to 73%. The results of the inventory holdings and lead times appear to\nsuggest that agile responses to the market are being provided, but from relatively high\ninventory holdings. This may reinforce the literature regarding the importance of\navailability in agility and also the concept of decoupling points. Thus many of the\ndistribution centres may be holding the \u201cstrategic inventory\u201d which defines the supply\nchain decoupling point.\niii Customer segmentation\nA further analysis of the above figures provides some indication as to whether\ndifferent service levels are being provided from the distribution centres. This would\nbe expected if customer (or product) segmentation is being applied.\n18\nFor this purpose, the categories used in Figure 5 have been used. This does not\nprovide a strict count of the number of different lead times provided, as for example a\n3 day service to one customer group would appear in the same category as a 5 day\nservice to another group. However, it does provide an indication.\nPLACE FIGURE 6 HERE\nThe results indicate that 67% of distribution centres are just offering one service level\n(within the above definition). Most of these (36% of respondents) offer a next day\nservice level. These figures indicate that segmentation, in terms of lead times, only\noccurs in about one third of the distribution centres.\niv Added value activities\nFor the purposes of the survey, added value activities were classified into two groups:\nthose prior to despatch and those associated with reverse flows. Postponement\nactivities may be associated with added value activities prior to despatch and these\nresults are shown in Figure 7.\nPLACE FIGURE 7 HERE\n19\nA total of 71% of distribution centres undertook some form of added value activity\nprior to despatch (described as \u201cany activity\u201d in Figure 7). The most common type of\nactivity (56%) involved labelling, pricing or tagging goods. This may be a form of\npostponement (or may indeed be an activity previously conducted at store level).\nProduction postponement may be more closely allied to final assembly and this was\nundertaken at 31% of sites. Interestingly, 11% of sites also undertook testing\nactivities.\nAs regards reverse flow activity, this was conducted in 42% of distribution centres,\nwith disassembly (18% of sites) and refurbishment (also 18%) being the most\ncommon activities. Only 4% of sites conducted repair activities and the same\npercentage modification activities.\nIn terms of the scale of these added value activities, it can be seen from Figure 8 that\nthey occupied only 5% of the floor area of the distribution centres. Thus, although the\nmajority of distribution centres undertake these activities, they are normally fairly\nminor in nature.\nPLACE FIGURE 8 HERE\n20\nv Cross docking\nThe survey indicates that a relatively small proportion of goods is cross docked\nthrough most distribution centres (see Figure 9). In fact, 74% of distribution centres\ncross-dock 5% or less of their total throughput; the majority of the throughput coming\nfrom inventory held within the distribution centres themselves. Only 7% of the sites\ncross-dock more than 20% of their throughput.\nPLACE FIGURE 9 HERE\nThe floor area usage in Figure 8 supports this finding that most large distribution\ncentres are chiefly involved with supplying goods from inventory. Just over 50% of\nthe floor areas of the distribution centres were taken up with storage and a further\n22% with picking and packing (presumably chiefly in relation to these stored goods).\nGoods in \/ out activities accounted for 18% of the floor area, which again would\nsuggest typical activities in stockholding warehouses.\nIt should be noted that this survey only covered large distribution centres and it is\npossible that cross-docking may be more frequently found in smaller depots. For\nexample, large central distribution centres often send goods to a number of smaller\ndepots where they are cross-docked for final delivery to the customer.\n21\nvi Third party logistics providers\nAs regards the use of third party logistics providers, 64% of the distribution centres\nwere operated by such companies. Most of these were dedicated facilities. Shared\nuser facilities represented 11% of the total. This could be interpreted as a high\nproportion of companies potentially forming \u201cextended enterprises\u201d or \u201cvirtual\norganisations\u201d, but a fairly low proportion making use of the variable amount of space\nthat may be possible within a shared user facility.\nChallenges\nWhen asked the main challenge that the distribution centre operation has faced since\nopening the most common reply was cost reduction (73% of respondents). In looking\nahead over the next three years, the major challenge was viewed however as shorter\nlead times (64%), whilst cost reduction reduced to 51% of respondents. This may\nindeed signify a shift in emphasis from the \u201clean\u201d paradigm, which is often associated\nwith cost reduction, to the \u201cagile\u201d paradigm where service levels are regarded as the\nmarket winner.\nA change from a \u201clean\u201d to an \u201cagile\u201d paradigm would be a major challenge for most\nsupply chain infrastructures, particularly as many warehouse equipment types, as well\nas the buildings themselves, have long asset lives. In addition, the requirement to\nmaintain high service levels and efficiency during any period of major equipment\ncommissioning is very difficult to achieve. This challenge is exemplified by the U.K.\n22\ngrocery retailer, Sainsbury\u2019s, which is changing from predominantly stockholding\nRegional Distribution Centres to \u201cflow through\u201d Fulfilment Factories. This has\ninvolved moving from an infrastructure chiefly comprising conventional wide aisle\nracking to one combining automated storage and retrieval systems (AS\/RS), pick\nconveyors and sophisticated sortation systems. The investment and implementation\nconsequences have been a significant cause of concern to financial analysts and\ninvestors during this period of change. This demonstrates the severe difficulties and\nrisks that many companies face in developing their infrastructure in this way.\nConclusion\nThe research results indicate that there is an increasing take-up of large distribution\ncentres in the U.K and that these are still fulfilling the traditional role of warehouses,\nnamely holding inventory and breaking bulk for customer orders. The levels of cross\ndocking activity appear to be fairly low. However, most of the distribution centres\nsurveyed do provide a rapid response to customer orders. Most also provide some\nform of added value activities but these services tend to relate to finalising the\npresentation of the goods, such as labelling, pricing and tagging. Some production\npostponement, in the form of final assembly, is undertaken, although, on the whole,\nrelatively little floor area appears to be given over to added value activities.\nThis picture tends to fit with such concepts as decoupling points, whereby there are\nstrategic inventory holdings in supply chains from which agile responses can be given\nto the market place. As indicated in the literature, this may be due to the need to\nmanage volatility in local markets along with global supply chains. In fact, such\n23\nfactors as global sourcing and product proliferation may well be counteracting the\napplication of contemporary supply chain concepts as reflected in the constant\nnational inventory ratios during the past few years.\nThe relatively low use of production postponement and cross docking in many of the\ndistribution centres surveyed may indicate that many companies are still driven by\ninventory based thinking (e.g. economic batch quantities and replenishment points)\nrather than by the use of information based concepts (e.g. Efficient Consumer\nResponse, and Collaborative Planning Forecasting and Replenishment). However, it\nmay be that these concepts are only fully applicable in a limited range of\ncircumstances.\nFurther research is needed to understand the precise relationships observed. For\nexample, it might be that agile strategies would not involve large distribution centres\nsuch as the type surveyed. However, the increasing take-up of such sites does tend to\nindicate that such centres still play a major role in modern supply chains. Research is\ntherefore needed to investigate how agile, and other, strategies can be implemented\nand what type of facilities are required.\nOn the basis that the major challenge foreseen by the distribution centre managers\nover the next three years is to reduce customer lead times, the issue becomes one of\ndefining the exact role of distribution centres within supply chains and the\nimplications for their design.\n24\nReferences\n[1] La Londe, Bernard J., \u201cEvolution of the Integrated Logistics Concept,\u201d in The\nLogistics Handbook, Eds.
