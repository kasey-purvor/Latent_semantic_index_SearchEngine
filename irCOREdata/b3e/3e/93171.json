J . FULLER AND HARIPR IYA NARAS IMHAN\nCondemnation and celebration are important in the Indian middle\nclass\u2019s discourse about itself, but neither necessarily reflects social\nreality with much accuracy. First, though, we must broadly define\nthe \u2018middle class\u2019 under discussion. Sociologists of the west usually\ndistinguish between the \u2018old\u2019 middle class\u2014the property-owning petty\nbourgeoisie\u2014and the \u2018new\u2019 middle class of educated and qualified,\nprofessional and technical, white-collar staff, which has grown steadily\nsince the nineteenth century (Giddens 1973: 177\u20139). In India, this\nnew middle class was a product of colonial rule and, even though very\ninfluential, it remained tiny comparedwith itswestern equivalent until\nrecently (Be\u00b4teille 2003a: 76\u20139; 2003b: 192\u20134). Varma\u2019s \u2018traditional\u2019\nand Das\u2019s \u2018new\u2019 middle classes do not correspond, we should note,\nto the old and new middle classes of western sociology, and Das\u2019s\ncategory is virtually equivalent to the \u2018new rich\u2019. In studies of this\nincreasingly prominent stratum in various Asian countries, as well as\nIndia, \u2018new rich\u2019 is the deliberately loose phrase chosen to emphasise\nthat it is indeed new and rich, as well as to evade some definitional\ndifficulties surrounding \u2018middle class\u2019 (Pinches 1999; Robison and\nGoodman 1996).\nThe new entrepreneurs, managers and technocrats in contemporary\nChina and Vietnam probably constitute the plainest examples of the\nAsian new rich (Robison and Goodman 1996: 3\u20136). In India, owing\nto its mixed economy, liberalisation had less radical consequences,\nbut it has also fostered the emergence of a comparable new rich\nof entrepreneurs and professionals in the private sector. None of\nthese developments means that the older middle class of bureaucrats,\nlawyers, bank officials, teachers and others has become unimportant.\nOur discussion, however, which is based on data collected in Chennai\n(formerly Madras), looks at one of the most high-profile sections of\nthe new-rich middle class in urban India: the professional staff in\nthe new information technology (IT) companies that provide \u2018the\nindispensable, material basis\u2019 for the \u2018informational global\u2019 economy\ndescribed by Manuel Castells (1996: 66).\nThe Information Technology Industry in India\nThe two most important sectors of the Indian IT industry are\nsoftware and services, and business process outsourcing (BPO).\nSoftware and services companies (hereafter software companies)\nsupply and maintain the IT systems used by large companies and\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESS IONALS 123\nother organisations, including the systems required to outsource work\nto offshore locations, where it is carried out by BPO companies. In\nthe last few years, the Indian IT industry has been growing quickly.\nThus, the value of software and services exports rose from $3.4\nbillion in 1999\u20132000 to $12 billion in 2004\u20135, which is equal to\napproximately 20 per cent of all India\u2019s exports. The number of\n\u2018knowledge professionals\u2019 in the industry, 522,000 in 2001\u20132, crossed\none million in 2004\u20135, and continued rapid growth is expected;\nroughly one-third of this workforce is in the export-oriented software\nsector. Overwhelmingly, this is a young industry, in which the median\nage of software professionals is about 27.5.1\nSome software companies have grown at a phenomenal rate. A now\nfamous example is Infosys Technologies, which was started in 1981\nwith an investment of $1000, had annual revenues of nearly $4million\nten years later and reached $1 billion by 2004 (Heitzman 2004: 181\u2013\n3).2 The company and its founder and chairman, N. R. Narayana\nMurthy, have becomemodern legends, and Peter van der Veer (2005)\nrightly identifies a \u2018culture of magical belief\u2019 now surrounding IT\nas an economic success story for India. The IT industry has also\n\u2018become the new great white hope of the Indian middle class\u2019, as\nan editorial in Economic and Political Weekly put it.3 IT entrepreneurs\nand professionals are among Das\u2019s new middle-class heroes (2002:\n245\u201353), and he even proposes that India can leapfrog the industrial\nage, because \u2018in information technology we may have finally found\nthe engine that can drive India\u2019s takeoff and transform our country\u2019\n(ibid.: xvii). The business press is similarly enthusiastic; in 2003, the\nAmerican magazine BusinessWeek carried a cover story claiming that\nIndia might be the first developing nation to use its \u2018brainpower\u2019\nas the motor of growth. The magazine quoted various enthusiastic\nyoung people, including one 22-year-old student in Bangalore, the\ncountry\u2019s IT capital, who proclaimed that: \u2018IT is driving India\u2019s boom,\n1 Data from NASSCOM (National Association of Software and Services\nCompanies); see www.nasscom.org: Home> Resource Centre > Facts & Figures >\nIndian IT Software and Services Market; Home > IT Workforce > Indian Scenario >\nProfile;Home>MediaRoom>Press Releases (2 and 16 June 2005);monthly reviews\nin Home > Media Room > Newsline [accessed July 2005].

FULLER AND HARIPR IYA NARAS IMHAN\nand we in the younger generation can really deliver the country from\npoverty\u2019.4\nPlainly, wemust be sceptical about the opinions of business gurus, let\nalone youthful students in Bangalore, and Narayana Murthy himself\n(2000) is notably cautious about the future prospects of India\u2019s IT\nindustry and the country\u2019s development. Nevertheless, althoughmuch\noptimistic talk about IT in India is exaggerated, it is not all magical\nfantasy. Thus, for example, the software industry is \u2018maturing\u2019 by\nmoving into higher value-added markets, rather than stagnating as\na low value-added industry viable only because of its cheap labour\nforce; one sign of this is the rising proportion of offshore software\nexports, because more work for foreign clients by Indian software\ncompanies is now done \u2018offshore\u2019 in India, rather than \u2018on-site\u2019 at the\nclients\u2019 offices (Bhatnagar and Madon 1997: 279 & passim; Kumar\n2001: 4279; cf. D\u2019Costa 2003: 124\u20136 for a more sceptical view).5 As a\nresult, \u2018bodyshopping\u2019, whereby low-paid software workers are sent to\nforeign countries as exploited \u2018techno-coolies\u2019 (Mir et al. 2000: 23\u20135),\nnow occurs less than it did a few years ago. Overall, if current trends\ncontinue, more high-value software engineering will be done in India,\nrather than overseas, and this (as we shall see later) is significant for\nIT professionals\u2019 migration patterns.\nAlthough Bangalore is India\u2019s premier IT centre (Heitzman 2004:\n165\u2013217)\u2014and Hyderabad is prominent\u2014Chennai is rapidly deve-\nloping as well and a huge array of software and BPO companies\nhave established themselves in the city. Ranked by export revenue,\nIndia\u2019s top six software companies, all well-established in Chennai,\nare Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys Technologies, Wipro\nTechnologies, Satyam Computer Services, Cognizant Technology\nSolutions (CTS) and HCL Technologies.6 In our research, we have\n4 Manjeet Kripalani and Pete Engardio, \u2018The Rise of India\u2019, BusinessWeek (Asian\nedition), 8 December 2003, pp. 42\u201354.\n5 Offshore software exports, as a proportion of the total, rose from 34.7 per cent\nin 1999\u20132000 to 57.9 per cent (estimate) in 2002\u20133, and NASSCOM stated that\n\u2018the offshore delivery model became the preferred business model. . .during 2003\u20134\u2019:\nwww.nasscom.org: Home > Resource Centre > Facts & Figures > Indian IT Software\nand Services Market [accessed November 2004]. In one leading software company,\nCognizant Technology Solutions, the mix is around 70\u201375 per cent offshore and 30\u2013\n25 per cent on-site, according to its chairman in 2004; seeHinduBusiness Line, Internet\nedition, 10 October 2004: www.thehindubusinessline.com.\n6 Data on export revenue ranking (2003\u20134) from NASSCOM; see\nwww.nasscom.org: Home > Resource Centre > Facts & Figures > Top 20 Software\nCompanies [accessed November 2004]. For Chennai, data from STPI (Software\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESS IONALS 125\nmainly been interviewing staff in one of these six, which we call Indian\nComputer Services (ICS), although we have also collected information\nin other companies.\nLet us now outline a profile of the IT professionals whowork in ICS to\nidentify the combination of features that makes them distinctive. ICS,\nlike similar companies, operates in several \u2018vertical domains\u2019\u2014such as\nfinancial services, insurance or retailing\u2014and some of its professional\nstaff are experts in particular domains. Themajority of staff, however,\nare qualified or trained in software engineering, and they normally\nhave a particular specialist expertise.7 Some of them come to ICS from\nother IT companies, but most are directly recruited from engineering\n(or other) colleges. Students should have a consistent record of high\nexamination marks before they can sit the company\u2019s aptitude test\nand proceed to an interview, where only one out of twelve is offered a\njob. ICS\u2019s managers are promoted engineers or other people recruited\nfrommanagement institutes or other firms. Approximately one-fifth of\nnew recruits are women; both they and theirmale colleagues generally\ninsist that there is no gender inequality in the company, although the\ntop management is still all male.8 There is severe market competition\nfor good staff and moving between software companies is fairly easy.\nStarting salaries at ICS, which are in the middle of the range for large\nsoftware companies, are around 15,000 rupees per month for people\nin their early twenties and can easily double within a few years.\nThe Indian middle class is sometimes identified (especially by\nmarketing experts) as a \u2018consuming class\u2019 (cf. Corbridge and Harriss\n2000: 123\u20134; Deshpande 2003: 134\u20139; Mankekar 1999: 75\u20136), which\nmay in turn be equated with the \u2018middle-high\u2019 income category, as\ndefined by the National Council of Applied Economic Research; in\n2001\u20132, this category included households with annual incomes over\n90,000 rupees and made up 28 per cent of all Indian households.\nExtrapolated NCAER data also show that in 2001\u20132 only about 6\nper cent of households fell into its \u2018high-income\u2019 category with an\nTechnology Parks of India), Chennai; see www.stpc.soft.net: Home > Performance\nand Analysis > Major players [accessed November 2004].\n7 For a simple explanation of the software industry and software engineering, see\nMir et al. (2000: 17\u201320).\n8 In Indian software companies, 79 per cent of software professionals were men\nin 2001\u20132, but this is projected to fall to 65 per cent by 2005: www.nasscom.org:\nHome > Advantage India > Why India > Knowledge Professionals [accessed July\n2005].\n126 C . J . FULLER AND HARIPR IYA NARAS IMHAN\nannual income over 180,000 rupees.9 Yet ICS recruits, like other IT\nprofessionals, enjoy individual incomes around this level, so that by\nIndian standards they are very well-paid and certainly belong to the\ncountry\u2019s new rich.\nStaff in ICS undergo appraisal by line managers every six months;\nstaff who exceed targets can expect rapid promotion and salary\nincreases, but it is made clear to those who fall short that they will be\n\u2018let go\u2019 and should leave the company. Most staff work a 40 to 50-hour,\nfive-dayweek according to a flexitime system, butmanagers oftenwork\nlonger hours; pressure to meet deadlines is also common and extra\nhours are then expected, from men and women alike. Most work is\ndone by teams of software engineers, together with a few domain\nspecialists, who are supervised by project managers; a team\u2019s size can\nvary from a handful to a hundred or so, and some team members\nmay be working abroad on-site, while others stay in India. Almost all\nstaff work in modern, open-plan offices and team members, male and\nfemale, work closely together; interactions between young men and\nwomen, many unmarried, are noticeably free and easy compared with\nthose seen in most social situations in Chennai. Very importantly,\nmajor IT firms like ICS are, and are universally understood to be, part\nof a global industry, not just an Indian one, in which theUS is themain\nmarket; on-site overseas project assignments, lasting several months\nor even a year or two, are a normal part of working life and, because\nthere is a global software labour market, opportunities to secure posts\nabroad or to go there temporarily to earn large sums of money are\nabundant.\nFinally, in this list of distinctive features, let us note that ICS, like\nmany other IT companies in Chennai, is said to be dominated by\nthe high-status \u2018Forward Castes\u2019\u2014especially Tamil Brahmans, who\nform about 2.5 per cent of Tamilnadu\u2019s population\u2014and it is our\nstrong impression that this is true (cf. Fuller 1999: 34; Harriss 2003:\n333). On the other hand, no accurate figures exist and \u2018guesstimates\u2019\nby people in IT vary greatly. All the same, in the public image of\nChennai\u2019s IT industry, the large Brahman presence is a prominent\nfeature for insiders and outsiders alike.\n9 NCAER\u2019s \u2018middle-high\u2019 category comprises \u2018middle\u2019, \u2018upper-middle\u2019 and \u2018high\u2019.\n\u2018High\u2019 income households are defined as those with annual incomes above 140,000\nrupees in 1998\u20139 prices, equivalent to 180,000 rupees in 2001\u20132. In 1998\u20139, this\ncategory made up 5.7 per cent of all Indian households. These data were reported\nby the Economist Intelligence Unit on 23 June 2004; see aigonline.com: Home>\nRegional Risk Analysis > South Asia.\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESS IONALS 127\nEthnographic Sketches\nThis section contains ethnographic sketches of some of the nineteen\npeople working in ICS whom we have interviewed. All names used\nare pseudonyms. This admittedly tiny sample of a workforce of\nseveral thousand is the haphazard product of the problems of access\nbesetting this sort of research among busy, urban middle-class people\nworking in an industry that is unusually concerned with security and\nconfidentiality.\nOne of ICS\u2019s personnel managers is Ramakrishna. Ramakrishna is\nin his late thirties and is married with two young daughters. He comes\nfrom a district south of Chennai, where his family owns some land;\nhe belongs to the non-Brahman Reddiar caste. Ramakrishna studied\nat a reputed engineering college and then gained an MCA (Master\u2019s\nin Computer Applications). He worked for an advertising firm, an\nIT company and a US-based recruitment agency before joining ICS\nbecause it offered him superior career opportunities. Ramakrishna\nlooked more stressed-out than anyone we have ever met; he never\nsmiled, he kept rolling his eyes and closing them, he never sat still\nfor a moment, and even though he talked to us quite freely, we are\nsure hewas thinking about other thingsmost of the time.Ramakrishna\ndescribed his own job as \u2018tough and challenging\u2019; it is his responsibility\nto ensure that in the \u2018war for talent\u2019 among the leading companies,\nICS can recruit enough high-quality personnel, especially by picking\nthe best graduates from the top colleges.\nAs far as Ramakrishna is concerned, his attitude to his work and\nfamily differs radically from his father\u2019s. He \u2018lives for the present\u2019,\nwhile his father, a retired manager in a state government corporation,\n\u2018lived for the future\u2019; although he still lives with his parents, he\nputs his own nuclear family and himself first, ahead of the extended\nfamily. Ramakrishna\u2019s two daughters attend one of the city\u2019s most\nexpensive Montessori schools and he spoke of spending \u2018quality time\u2019\nwith his children. His family takes an annual holiday as well as periodic\nweekends away; he and his family insist on their own privacy and he has\nlearnt to say \u2018no\u2019 when it is infringed. At present, he said, he is happy to\nwork in India because prospects in the booming IT sector are so good,\nbut if it were better for his career and for his wife and children, he\nwould move to America. Ramakrishna also emphasised that ICS, like\nall successful IT companies, is a very competitive place towork inwhich\nthose who want to succeed must often work long and anti-social hours\nunder the continual pressure of tight deadlines; good people in the\n128 C . J . FULLER AND HARIPR IYA NARAS IMHAN\nfirm want \u2018careers\u2019, not just \u2018jobs\u2019, but they also want high salaries and\nthey know that pay and promotion depend on individual performance,\nnot age and seniority. Our information is that Ramakrishna earns\nabout 70,000 rupees per month and, like other senior managers in\nthe large IT companies, he has valuable stock options. Nevertheless,\nover many months in 2003\u20134, he was negotiating for a salary increase\nwhile continually threatening to leave for another job in Bangalore.\nRamakrishna, the first person we met in ICS and the most senior,\nconformed quite closely to the image of the driven, individualistic\nexecutive that is an IT industry stereotype. Interestingly, though, he\nturned out to be rather unusual. Our next three sketches are all of\nproject managers, responsible with their assistantmanagers for teams\nof software engineers. The first, Ravi, is 33; he is married, without\nchildren, to a personnel manager, and he and his wife live with his\nparents. He is a Palghat Brahman (a Tamil Brahman from Kerala),\nbrought up in Chennai. After finishing his first degree, he was offered\nposts in a bank and an insurance company, both state-run, but he\nturned them down to study for an MTech at the prestigious Indian\nInstitute of Technology (IIT) at Kharagpur, West Bengal. By then\nRavi had become interested in computing and his first job was in a\nCalcutta software company; in 1995, he returned to Chennai, joined\nICS and has been with them ever since. In 2004, he was managing a\nteam of 32 staff in Chennai and 20 in Britain, which was working on\na project for a British company expected to last two years.\nRavi claimed to work twelve hours a day, but tries to keep his\nweekends free; he said that there is always some stress in his job,\nbut that he can handle it by working with good teams. Building\ncooperative teams of people with the right skills is a crucial part of\nhis job as a manager. Many members of his current team are women,\nincluding his assistant manager; he believes that ICS values both\nsexes equally, and recognises the domestic pressures that women\noften face in Chennai. Ravi repeatedly said that he finds the IT\nindustry \u2018empowering\u2019, because he could never have acquired so much\nautonomy and responsibility so quickly in any other walk of life, and\neven at lower levels, people feel a \u2018sense of ownership\u2019 of their work. In\na nationalised bank, by contrast, he would have had to put up with the\noppressive bureaucratic hierarchy. He therefore has no regrets about\nhis career decision and his parents have given him much support.\nHe and his wife, who is happy because she wanted to marry an IT\nprofessional, spent one year in England working on-site, where he\nearned plenty of money and got \u2018good exposure\u2019\u2014a common phrase\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESS IONALS 129\ndenoting a wide range of new opportunities and experiences\u2014but\nRavi is close to his family, wanted to come home to be with his elderly\nfather, and has no desire to live abroad.\nBalaram is 37; he is married to a part-time IT consultant, they have\ntwo children and they live as a nuclear family. Balaram is a Brahman,\nborn in Salem and raised in Chennai. He has a BSc in maths and\nan MCA from the University of Hyderabad, and under some pressure\nfromhis parents he took a selection test for the nationalised banks. But\nhe never wanted a job in a bank or any other public-sector undertaking.\nInstead, after graduating, he obtained a job in another major software\ncompany and then moved several times before joining ICS in 1994.\nIn 1995, however, he left ICS and migrated to Australia, where he\nworked in IT in a variety of roles, before returning to Chennai in 2003\nand rejoining ICS. He is now amanager of a team of 100 staff working\non a project for a US medical insurance company.\nBalaram appeared to be fairly relaxed about his job and said that\nhe always took the weekends off. For him, the most important aspect\nof a job is that it should offer variety, opportunities to improve one\u2019s\nexperience, and a feeling of satisfaction about achieving something\nimportant. Balaram has worked in Britain and America, but prefers\nAustralia as a place to live and bring up children. Nevertheless,\nhe decided to return from Australia because the work available in\nChennai is far more interesting and challenging, and the industry\u2019s\ngrowth prospects are much better. Balaram specifically said that he\nwas under no pressure from his parents to return to Chennai. After\nthe interview in early 2004, Balaram was transferred to ICS\u2019s offices\nin Ireland.\nAnuradha is a project manager in her early thirties. She is married\nto another IT professional and has one daughter; they all live with\nhis parents, and her own parents live in the same apartment block.\nAnuradha is a Tamil Brahman and a native of Chennai. She took a\ndegree in electrical and electronic engineering at a reputed college in\nCoimbatore and then worked for two different software companies,\nfor one of which she did on-site work in Britain and America. After\nmarriage, Anuradha moved with her husband to America, where she\njoined ICS, working for the company there between 2000 and 2002.\nBut she never wanted to live abroad and had made it a condition of\nher marriage that she and her husband returned to live in Chennai\nafter making some money. Anuradha manages a team of twenty staff\nin Chennai working on a project for a major US medical insurance\ncompany.\n130 C . J . FULLER AND HARIPR IYA NARAS IMHAN\nBecause she has a young child, Anuradha now refuses to go abroad\non on-site assignments, and said that this is not a problem because she\ndoes not need any more \u2018exposure\u2019. She does not find her job stressful\nand does not work at weekends; she is close to her family, finds living\nwith her husband\u2019s parents easy, and can always rely on them and\nher own parents to care for her daughter during the working day.\nAnuradha firmly believes that the IT industry has helped to empower\nwomen, giving them choices that their mothers never had, and that\nwomen are no longer looked down upon by men. All in all, Anuradha\nis content with the comfortable life that working for ICS in Chennai\nhas given her.\nShoaib, a native of Chennai, is in charge of ICS\u2019s intranet and\nwebsite. He is 29 and recently married, and he and his wife live\nwith his widowed mother. Shoaib\u2019s wife, who is a graduate, does not\nhave a job; although his own mother has always worked, he does not\nbelieve that wives should work outside the home and he claims that\nhis wife has the same opinion. Shoaib has a BSc in computer science\nfrom a Muslim college in Chennai and an MCA. He did a project\nas part of his MCA at ICS and joined the company six years ago; he\nworked in America formore than a year and briefly in England. Shoaib,\nhowever, is adamant that he does not want to live or work abroad in\nan \u2018alien country\u2019 where he would be separated from his family. His\nmother works in the Tamil Nadu government\u2019s fisheries department\nand his father was an engineer in the state electricity board; after his\npremature death, Shoaib was offered a post in the board as well, but he\nturned it down. He said that he would never work in the public sector,\nbecause there you always \u2018have to bow your head to somebody\u2019. On\nthe other hand, Shoaib remarked that \u2018there is no security in this job\u2019\nand seemed more concerned than most of his colleagues about future\nuncertainties.\nInMarch 2004, Jayashree, a Tamil Brahman and native of Chennai,\nwas an assistant project manager for three small teams. Jayashree is\nabout 35 and married with two children; her husband also works in\nIT and they live with his parents. She has an MSc in physics from IIT-\nMadras and an MTech from Anna University in Chennai. Jayashree\nfirst worked as a programmer in a leading software firm and then\nmoved to an IIT research project. Her daughter was born in 1992,\nand afterwards she and her husband decided to go abroad to earn\nmoney; they spent two-and-a-half years in Hong Kong, where she did\ncontract work, and six months in Singapore. On returning to Chennai,\nJayashree took a job in ICS.\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESS IONALS 131\nJayashree could normally keep her weekends free, but she was\npragmatic rather than enthusiastic about her job, and did not talk\nabout women\u2019s empowerment. In the interview, Jayashree mainly\nwanted to talk about her family, not her work, and she explained\nthat childcare for her 12-year-old daughter and 18-month-old son was\nan endlessly negotiated series of arrangements involving hired help\nand her parents-in-law and parents. She complained that her husband\ndid not do his share of household chores, many of which, she joked,\nhave been \u2018outsourced\u2019, so that take-away meals are now routine.\nShe talked about the pressures of combining family life and work and,\nunlike Anuradha, Jayashree found herself burdened with the problems\nfamiliar to many professional wives and mothers. She spoke especially\nof her guilt about her son, who had seen so little of her, and because\nshe wanted to spend more time with him, she later resigned from ICS,\nbut now does contract work at home for the company.\nJayashree introduced us to Sarojini and Parvati, two young software\nengineers on her team. Sarojini, in her mid-twenties, is a Nayar from\nsouthern Tamilnadu. She took a degree in electrical and electronic\nengineering in Coimbatore and entered ICS as a trainee in 2002.\nShe told us she was happy in ICS, and found her work exciting and\nchallenging, although her first ambition had been to study medicine.\nSarojini said that she expected her parents to arrange her marriage\nsoon, because in her community it is the \u2018tradition\u2019 for women to\nmarry in their mid-twenties, but she was insistent that her husband\nwould have to allow her to continue her career. Her mother also\nworks and Sarojini appeared to attribute her determination more\nto her matrilineal Nayar background than to any empowerment\nbrought about by the IT industry. Sarojini joked about marrying a\nprofessor, because her father is one and she has noticed that professors\ndo not do much work, so that her husband could look after their\nchildren, although she admitted that she expected to marry another\nIT professional. Later in 2004, though, Sarojini was sent to New Jersey\non an on-site assignment and by then she had acquired a boyfriend in\nICS, a Tamil Brahman from Mumbai, who was sent to Connecticut;\nthey now want to marry, and although her parents do not object, his\ndo. According to Parvati (in early 2005), Sarojini and her boyfriend\nwant to remain in America until his parents change their minds.\nParvati, who is the same age as Sarojini, is a Tamil Brahman\nand native of Chennai. She has a BSc in computer science and an\nMSc in information technology. In 2004, after six months in ICS,\nParvati was finding her work boring, although one year later, in\n132 C . J . FULLER AND HARIPR IYA NARAS IMHAN\nspite of complaints about her project manager, she was much more\nenthusiastic and ambitious. She had become a team leader and was\ndetermined to get an early posting in America. Finding a groom for\nParvati\u2019s elder sister, who works in computer hardware, is proving\ndifficult and one of Parvati\u2019s weekly tasks is to browse through an\ninternet matrimonial site, where statements about preferences for\n\u2018home-loving\u2019 wives increasingly irritate her. Parvati says that, like\nmost of her friends, she believes that love marriages are in principle\nbest, but finding a truly suitable partner is difficult. As far as we know,\nParvati has no boyfriend, and we think that she is actually likely to\nhave an arranged marriage, after her elder sister is finally settled.\nWhen first interviewed, Sarojini and Parvati said that they normally\nworked about 40\u201345 hours per week, but never at the weekend,\nalthough Parvati now works around ten hours a day during the week.\nThey laughed about a minority of young men who work at night and at\nweekends, pretending that they have to do so, whereas in fact they are\njust obsessed with computers. They both insisted thatmen and women\nare treated identically in ICS and that nobody thinks that women are\ntechnically less able than men, although Parvati believes that women\nmake better managers.\nOur last sketch is of Raghu, an unmarried 22-year-old software\nengineer who joined ICS after taking a degree in electronics and\ncommunication engineering in Coimbatore. He is a Tamil Brahman,\nbrought up in Kalpakkam, south of Chennai, where his father is an\nengineer in the nuclear power station. Raghu works on the production\nsupport system for a British client\u2019s project and says that every day a\nnew problem has to be solved, so that he never gets bored, although he\nthinks he is not learning much\u2014except how to say \u2018no\u2019 to demanding,\nforeign clients\u2014and he wants to leave the IT industry and study\nfor an MBA fairly soon. In the meantime, he enjoys the money and\ncommented that after one year he earned 200,000 rupees per annum,\ncompared with his father\u2019s salary of 400,000 rupees after thirty years,\nalthough even now his father tends to save and spends less money than\nRaghu. Raghu shares a flat in Chennai with two single male friends\nwho also work in IT, and they are unpopular with their neighbours,\nwho fear that they may smoke, drink, cook non-vegetarian food and\ncause a nuisance. In fact, they never cook and eat all their meals out,\nand during the week they just come home to sleep, although many\nof Raghu\u2019s friends come to his flat at weekends to drink beer. In the\nIT industry, Raghu said, at least half the men drink every weekend,\nalthough this appears to be the extent of most people\u2019s alcoholic\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESS IONALS 133\nindulgence; moreover, no women join these drinking sessions. Besides\ndrinking, Raghu and his friends play cricket at weekends; he also\ndoes voluntary work for a well-known charity in Chennai that provides\ncounselling for the depressed and suicidal, and he strongly disputed\nthe perception that IT professionals are selfish materialists.\nInformation Technology and \u2018Disturbing the Social Fabric\u2019\nTo those familiar with prosperous, urban, middle-class professionals\nin India, the lives of the ICS staff we have just sketched probably sound\nmundanely normal. Yet that is one point we wish to stress, because\nthe world of IT is surrounded by a set of negative stereotypes (and\noccasional lurid fantasies). Thus middle-class people in Chennai\u2014\nquoting a friend of a friend, or a similar source\u2014commonly assert\nthat IT professionals are overpaid, greedy, materialistic and obsessed\nby dreams of migrating to the west. They are all said to be overworked,\ntoo, which drives some of them into depression or even suicide,\nalthough many of them allegedly lead wild lives in bars at night and\nhave lots of illicit affairs as well. In many respects, these stereotypes\necho complaints about the newly rich middle class\u2019s materialism and\nselfishness as set out by Varma, for example, and they epitomise the\nway inwhich othermiddle-class people tend to project their supposedly\nworst sins on to IT workers. These stereotypes are an important\nelement in the discourse about IT in Chennai and one initial goal\nof our research was to find out if any of them had any substance.\nMostly, we have concluded, they do not, although some derogatory\ncomments about the IT industry do raise salient issues.\nSampath, aged about 50, is the personnel manager in Chakra\nVehicles (a pseudonym), a leading bus and lorry manufacturer in\nChennai. According to Sampath, \u2018peer pressure\u2019 makes young engin-\neers go abroad and those who take jobs in \u2018old economy\u2019 companies\nbased entirely in India like Chakra wonder if they are losing out. More\ngenerally, Sampath believes that the IT industry has \u2018disturbed the\nsocial fabric\u2019, because its employees get \u2018quick promotions\u2019, \u2018fancy des-\nignations\u2019 and \u2018phenomenal compensation\u2019, whereas jobs used to offer\nsecurity in the context of a long-term career with steady promotion\nprospects and a stable managerial structure, as is still largely true in\nChakra. Sampath, whose own wife works, does not object to women\ngoing out to work and said that they actually do less \u2018hopping\u2019 from job\nto job thanmen. Nonetheless, though well aware that far more women\n134 C . J . FULLER AND HARIPR IYA NARAS IMHAN\nwork in IT than manufacturing, he appeared unconcerned about their\nvirtual absence in Chakra, which has recruited only a handful of\nwomen engineers in the last few years. Sampath\u2019s comments touch\non several issues that we can separate for discussion. These include\nhigh salaries and consumerism; career trajectories and ambition; the\nposition of women in IT; attitudes to job security and the state; and\nmigration overseas.\nHigh Salaries and Consumerism\nIn the first place, Sampath is of course grumbling about competition\nfor staff from the IT companies. One of his colleagues specifically said\nthat at campus interviews by the late 1990s, only fourth-rate men\nwanted to join Chakra, because everyone better was after the high\nsalaries available in IT. But clearly, too, there is some envious distaste\nfor the IT professionals\u2019 high salaries and alleged preoccupation with\nmoney, for salaries inmanufacturing industry are generally lower, and\npromotion and increments come more slowly. Sampath, for example,\nprobably earns around 60,000 rupees per month (with no stock\noptions) after over twenty years of annual increments, whereas a\ncompetent IT professional could expect to reach this pay level in half\nthe time. In manufacturing industry, there is also a tendency to be\ndismissive about the \u2018IT craze\u2019, which reflects disdain for a fashionable\nindustry that is challenging an older, more established one based on\n\u2018real\u2019, rather than virtual, engineering.\nHowever much other people may criticise them, IT professionals\nthemselves readily acknowledge that high salaries matter because,\nas many of them said, the money means that they can now enjoy a\nvery comfortable standard of living comparable with that available\nin the west. New forms of consumer expenditure\u2014notably holidays,\nboth in India and abroad\u2014are becoming common, although most of\nthe income, as far as we can tell, is spent on housing; for those with\nchildren, costly private education is also amajor expense. Expenditure\non prestigious housing and education is, of course, ostentatious\nconsumption, as well as generally sound investment, but IT profes-\nsionals, whatever their age or salary level, do not appear particularly\npreoccupied by consumerism.10 Thus, for example, none of them has\n10 Although the evidence on India is less solid, it is interesting that none of\nit suggests a true parallel to the genuine \u2018consumer revolution in urban China\u2019\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESS IONALS 135\never talked to us about cars or restaurants as if they were matters\nof much concern, and none of them goes to work wearing particularly\nelegant, costly or fashionable clothes or jewellery. Software companies\nhave dress codes, such as \u2018business formals\u2019 on Monday, \u2018business\ncasuals\u2019 from Tuesday to Thursday, and \u2018casuals\u2019 on Friday and\nat weekends. On all days, however, a large majority of female IT\nprofessionals wear a shalwar kamiz, although some wear a sari or a\n\u2018western\u2019 blouse and trousers on formal days, and somewear a tee-shirt\nand jeans on casual days. No women in ICS are scruffily dressed, but\nwe were struck by the modest and even unfashionable clothes worn by\nsome of them. Nor did any of them display any anxiety comparable to\nwhat Purnima Mankekar (1999: 97) found in a young, lower-middle-\nclass woman in Delhi who had obtained a job in a multinational\ncompany andwas veryworried about being poorly dressed atwork. This\nwoman\u2019s anxiety, however, was linked to her precarious class position\n(ibid.: 86), and her (and others\u2019) \u2018desire. . .to buy consumer goods\nseemed deeply embedded in a desire to attain middle-class status\u2019\n(ibid.: 95). Similarly, writing about the newly-emerging middle class\nof Kathmandu, Mark Liechty emphasises \u2018the constantly contested,\nhighly materialistic, and anxious character\u2019 of their lives (2002: 18)\nand the \u2018precarious and fleeting\u2019 nature of middle-class status (ibid.:\n19), and he also argues that \u2018commodities. . .are the primary currency\nof middle-class life\u2019 (ibid.: 31).\nFor IT professionals, as members of the new-rich, middle class\nin Chennai, consumption\u2014especially in housing and children\u2019s\neducation\u2014obviously is important for their class status (Lakha\n1999), but it does not define the \u2018primary currency\u2019, which is rather\neducational qualifications and professional employment. Moreover\nand more significantly\u2014although Shoaib is perhaps an exception\u2014\nour informants\u2019 middle-class status is mostly felt to be secure and is\nrarely perceived as precarious or unstable. This contrasts with the\nsituation of the white-collar workers in Mumbai discussed by Leela\ndescribed by the ethnographers inDavis (2000), or indeed to the rampantmaterialism\nfound among the Chinese urban middle class (Rosen 2004). In China, economic\nliberalisation and the emergence of a market in consumer goods meant that the\nparty-state, now promotingmoney-making entrepreneurship, also drastically reduced\nits control over all aspects of its citizens\u2019 lives, so that people could now establish new,\nfreer forms of social relationship with each other, often mediated by patterns of\nconsumption. But no such revolutionary transformation has accompanied economic\nliberalisation in India, of course, because the government never exerted so much\ncontrol over people\u2019s daily lives.\n136 C . J . FULLER AND HARIPR IYA NARAS IMHAN\nFernandes, who belong to a rather lower segment of the middle class\nand face much uncertainty owing to the restructuring of the city\u2019s\nlabour market. Among these people, a contradiction exists between\neconomic uncertainty and their \u2018aspirations\u2019 towards \u2018prosperity and\nconsumption that characterize images of the \u201cnew\u201d middle class\ndream in liberalizing India\u2019 (Fernandes 2000: 103). IT professionals\ndo not have to deal with this contradiction, which is probably one\nmain reason why none of them appears anxiously preoccupied by\nconsumption as a signifier of status.\nCareer Trajectories and Ambitions\nSampath disparagingly compared the IT industry\u2019s career structure\nwith the stabler one in manufacturing companies, although he also\ncommented that young people in general change jobs a lot nowadays.\nAnother seniorChakramanager summed it upwell: in the past, people\nworked to achieve \u2018benchmarks\u2019, government jobs were preferred, and\na \u2018monthly salary was looked upon as a great thing\u2019, whereas it no\nlonger is. Or, as Viswanathan, a retired manager who worked in the\npublic-sector Rourkela steel plant inOrissa for 32 years, put it\u2014partly\ncommenting on his own son, who used to work in ICS\u2014young people\ntoday change jobs \u2018every two years\u2019 and move up the ladder each time.\nIn his day, government jobs were the route to a \u2018settled life\u2019, but now\nthey pay relatively badly, today\u2019s \u2018working culture\u2019 is more impatient\nand nobody just wants to \u2018count their yearly increment\u2019.\nIn IT companies like ICS, staff who do well can expect rapid\npromotion and salary increases. Managerial hierarchies are flatter\nin IT companies than in manufacturing ones, which are more like the\nbureaucratic hierarchies of government and public-sector organisa-\ntions with systems of promotion by seniority and age-related salary\nscales. Moving between companies, especially in junior and middle-\nmanagement grades, is fairly common in both sectors, althoughmove-\nment from manufacturing to IT occurs more often than the reverse.\nIn the IT sector, too, people constantly talk about moving and they can\nchange jobs quite easily if they want to, so that all IT firms are very\nconcerned about \u2018attrition rates\u2019 and retention of high-quality staff.11\n11 According to a senior executive in Infosys, its annual \u2018attrition rate\u2019 of employees\nleaving the company was 7 per cent in 2003, which was claimed to be low for the\nsoftware industry; see R. Sukumar, \u2018The Infosys Effect\u2019, Business Today, 14 September\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESS IONALS 137\nYet despite the differences between old and new industries, and\nbetween older and younger people, our evidence shows that hopping\nfrom job to job is less prevalent in the IT sector than Sampath or\nViswanathan\u2014or gossiping IT professionals\u2014suppose and that, even\nwhen it does occur, money or promotion is not necessarily the main\nissue. Thus among themore senior ICS professionals we know, at least\nhalf have spent all or most of their working lives in ICS, and some\nIT professionals insist that staying in one company is actually the\nbest career strategy. Among their peers, Ramakrishna and Balaram,\nrepeatedly moving between firms primarily for career and financial\nadvancement, are actually unusual rather than typical.\nAmong staff in ICS, whether they have been changing jobs or not,\nlevels of career-minded ambition are variable. Software engineering\ndoes not demand exceptional ability, as some experienced people\nacknowledge; Shoaib was not the only person to claim that any school-\nleaver with reasonable intelligence could learn to do the job. He was\nexaggerating, but we have met several IT professionals who are bored\nbecause their work is too easy, and it is widely recognised that seriously\nambitious people may have to move into new fields: for example,\nby taking an MBA degree so that they can apply for a range of top\nmanagerial positions. None of our informants in ICS has actually\ndone this, but some, such as Raghu, talk about it as a possibility and\nabout the limitations of a career as a software engineer. Quite a lot\nof people, though, are not especially ambitious; Shoaib, for example,\ndoes not want to go abroad again, which will probably slow his future\nadvancement, and another man expressed his desire to move to a \u2018low-\npressure\u2019 job eventually. Attitudes,moreover, are influenced by gender\nand, although Anuradha and some other women in the IT industry do\nrefer to their sense of empowerment, career ambitiousness is certainly\ncommoner among men than women.\nWomen in the IT Industry\nAs mentioned above, approximately one-fifth of ICS\u2019s new recruits\nare women (almost the same proportion as the Indian IT professional\nworkforce as a whole) and the absence of \u2018gender bias\u2019 in the sector has\n2003, pp. 56\u201360. A senior ICS manager told us that there is \u2018severe competition\u2019\nfor trained, talented staff and an \u2018incredible level of poaching\u2019 between companies,\nalthough our own material suggests that he was probably exaggerating.\n138 C . J . FULLER AND HARIPR IYA NARAS IMHAN\nbeen noted before (Kumar 2001: 4282\u20133). Almost all IT professionals\nin Chennai, male and female, insisted to us that both sexes have\nequal technical skills, although women are sometimes said to make\nbetter managers. On the technical side, therefore, the make-up and\nleadership of project teams is unaffected by gender considerations\n(cf. Arun and Arun 2002: 45). This is consistent with evidence\nthat in India men are not thought to be better than women at\nmathematics, science and technology (Mukhopadhyay 2004: 476,\n481; Subrahmanyan 1998: 90) and, in relation to gender, the Indian\nIT industry contrasts with its counterparts in Europe and America.\nSarojini and Parvati joked about theminority of youngmen in ICS who\nare fixated on their computers, but in an English software company\nwhere she did ethnographic research, RuthWoodfield found that such\nfixation was commonplace and contributed to the fact that women\nin the company \u2018reported a double bind whereby they were either\ndeemed adequately feminine but. . .inadequate computer scientists\u2019 or\nvice versa (2000: 95). More generally, Woodfield concluded that \u2018the\ndegree to which skills were defined, recognised and assessed was more\ndependent on the sex of individualworkers than on the explicitly stated\nbusiness requirements of the organisation\u2019 (ibid.: 146) and she cites a\nrange of sources showing that her conclusions hold more generally for\ncompanies in the west.\nFemale software engineers in Chennai, however, are not thought\nto be inadequately feminine by anybody. The significant difference\nbetween men and women that exists in ICS and other Indian IT\ncompanies has to do, not with technical skills, but with attitudes to the\nfamily (cf. Fuller and Narasimhan n.d.). Married women professionals\nconsistently give their families higher priority than their work; among\nthe unmarried ones, who all assume that they will get married\neventually, some talk about the importance of families in the same\nway as married colleagues, whereas others\u2014thinking at this stage\nabout possible partners\u2014stress that they will insist on a husband who\nallows them to continue working. All single women, however, want to\nchoose whether to continue to work, whereas many men want non-\nworking, \u2018home-loving\u2019 wives. Hence both men and women commonly\nsay that female IT professionals prefer husbands who are also in the\nindustry, but males tend to prefer wives who are not.12 Some single\n12 One leading IT company has reportedly started an in-house, online matrimonial\nservice to encourage its staff to marry each other and thereby reduce the number of\nmarried women who resign to live with husbands working elsewhere.\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESS IONALS 139\nwomen plainly express their career ambition and most people assume\nthat numerous women will become senior managers in ICS fairly soon.\nHowever, it is impossible to predict whether today\u2019s young, ambitious\nwomenwill, in future, actually give their work a higher priority vis-a`-vis\nthe family. At present, even women who feel empowered as software\nprofessionals and continue to work after marriage and childbirth\ninvariably regard their responsibilities to their husbands, children,\nparents and other close kin asmost important. Hence all IT companies\nhave to institute fairly flexible work regimes that do (or should) allow\nwomen to come to the office late or leave early, or take time off to\ndeal with these responsibilities. Furthermore, because men know that\nwomen place families first and also believe that this is right, they do\nnot criticise women for their sense of priorities.\nFor some women like Anuradha, whose childcare arrangements are\nassured, working for ICS is compatible with her family obligations,\nwhereas for others like Jayashree, partly because of her childcare\nproblems, it was not. Major companies like ICS actually have mixed\nreputations for their attitudes towomen, and somewomen interviewed\nin a small software company claimed that their male boss was\nmore understanding about their needs than any manager in a big\norganisation could be. On the other hand, the managers of two\nother small companies\u2014one male and one female\u2014both admitted\nto reluctance about recruiting women, precisely because their family\nduties take them away from work, which small businesses cannot\nafford. Nevertheless, all IT companies in Chennai must recognise\nthe differences between women\u2019s and men\u2019s acknowledged family\nresponsibilities in order to operate successfully. In that respect, they\ndiffer fromwestern IT companies, such as those in Boston discussed by\nUma Devi (2002), whose Indian female professionals found it hard to\ncope with the assumption that an ideal worker has no family, although\nthis conversely tended to benefit Indian men who were able to rely on\ntotal domestic support from their wives.\nAs already implied, a common stereotype about IT professionals\nconcerns their alleged sexual misconduct. This is plainly related\nto suspiciousness about the moral conduct of young, independent\nwomen working long and late hours alongside men, which is a source\nof great anxiety for many of these women\u2019s parents. As is very\ncommon in India, parents particularly worry that their daughters\nmay acquire a bad reputation, so that their marriage prospects will\nbe seriously damaged. As far as we can tell, love affairs between\nyoung, single people working together in the same office or on project\n140 C . J . FULLER AND HARIPR IYA NARAS IMHAN\nteams are not unusual, especially on overseas assignments. Some\nrelationships lead to marriage, as Sarojini hopes hers will, and this\nis most probable when the couple belong to the same caste and would\nanyway be suitable partners for an arranged marriage. Nonetheless,\nconventional, arranged marriages are definitely the norm. Some men\nsay that single women are \u2018hard to catch\u2019 and refuse advances from\nmale colleagues precisely because they feel empowered at work. Very\nlike some educated, middle-class women in Bhubaneswar (Seymour\n1999: 213\u201314), women IT professionals in Chennai, who know their\nvalue as potential partners, also tend to be confident that their parents\nwill find them good husbands, so that in practice they mostly favour\narranged marriage, despite an ideal preference for love marriage;\nfurthermore, they know that life after a lovemarriage without support\nfrom both parents and parents-in-law will be very hard. For men, it\nmay be slightly less hard, but for most of them, too, arrangedmarriage\nis actually the better option. In Chennai\u2019s IT industry, therefore, love\nmarriage is rarer than outsiders often suppose, and in general most\nIT professionals appear to have conventional middle-class marriages\nand family lives.\nPlainly, the IT industry has not revolutionised the position of Indian\nwomen. Yet comparison with Patricia Caplan\u2019s ethnography (1985)\nsuggests that real change has occurred (cf. Arun and Arun 2002).\nIn 1974\u20135, Caplan studied upper-middle-class women in Chennai\nand found, for example, that for most of them, \u2018employment outside\nthe home is not considered at all desirable\u2019 (ibid.: 85) and, of those\nwho did work, all in professional occupations, only half were or had\nbeen married (ibid.: 88). When at work, professional women faced\nnumerous difficulties, especially in relationships with male colleagues\nand because of innuendoes about their supposed sexual immorality\n(ibid.: 91\u20132). A preference for \u2018home-loving\u2019 wives who do not go\nout to work after marriage is still common, as we have said, but\nthere is no longer any objection to single working women. Unlike\nCaplan\u2019s informants, ours have also complained only rarely about their\nmale colleagues\u2019 behaviour or about sexual harassment (which is still\ncommon in many workplaces). Moreover, companies like ICS do not\nunderpay or exploit women, and they givemany youngwomen software\nengineers a felt equality with men and a sense of empowerment\u2014\nor \u2018individual autonomy\u2019 (Harriss 2003: 333)\u2014which, as they\nthemselves stress, many women, not least their own mothers, have\nnever had. This empowerment is not trivial; in particular, young\nwomen IT professionals appear to command greater respect and have\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESS IONALS 141\nmore bargaining power within their families\u2014particularly over their\nown marriages\u2014than women before them have had. Further, partly\nbecause they bring so much money home, women living with their\nhusband\u2019s families can better resist exploitative demands from their\nmothers-in-law, and that is a genuine social change.\nEconomic Security and Attitudes Towards the State\nOne key reason why young people are unimpressed by safe monthly\nsalaries and annual increments is that they just do not fear\nunemployment and poverty like many of their parents did at a similar\nage. Everyone knows, of course, that the IT sector is particularly\nprone to global economic cycles. Nonetheless, it is also widely believed,\nespecially but not only by young people, that the Indian IT industry\u2014\nas well as profitable companies in manufacturing industry\u2014has a\nbright, long-term future in an environment of irreversible economic\nliberalisation and globalisation. Hence workers in these industries\ncan be confident about their own futures, even if they must sometimes\nchange or even lose their jobs during recessions. Within India, this\noptimism is probably confined to people working in themost expansive\nsectors of the economy, who do not include \u2018restructured\u2019 white-\ncollar staff in Mumbai (Fernandes 2000); today\u2019s confidence also con-\ntrasts sharply with the \u2018near siege mentality\u2019 found among Chennai\u2019s\nmiddle class in the 1970s, when employment opportunities were so\nscarce (L. Caplan 1987: 92). Conversely, it interestingly resembles\nthe \u2018new confidence\u2019 that developed among Japanese \u2018salary men\u2019\nin the 1960s; in 1959, they \u2018were worried about economic stability\n[and] there was a sense that daily livelihood was precarious\u2019,\nwhereas by 1969 confidence in Japan\u2019s economic prospects meant\nthat \u2018anxiety about material welfare has almost disappeared\u2019 (Vogel\n1971: 272).\nMost younger people we have interviewed have fathers (and\noccasionally mothers) who are or were employed in professional\nor managerial positions in government, or public- or private-sector\nfirms, and the only exceptional fathers are a few small businessmen\nor farmers. The younger generation\u2019s confidence in the future also\nmeans, of course, that they are confident about their middle-class\nstatus, unlike the more anxious people studied by Fernandes in\nMumbai, Mankekar in Delhi and Liechty in Kathmandu. So far at\nleast, this has not led to the self-questioning that arose in Japan\u2019s\n142 C . J . FULLER AND HARIPR IYA NARAS IMHAN\nnewly prosperous middle class when, for example, many young men\nsaid that they hoped for a more interesting life than becoming salary\nmen (Vogel 1971: 274). On the other hand, younger middle-class\npeople in Chennai are notably less preoccupied than their elders\nhave been with saving for the future and less willing to wait to buy\nproperty and consumer goods. Often using loans, young professionals\nbuy apartments or houses much earlier than their parents did, so\nthat people even say that housing now comes before children, which\nit never did in the past. Raghu contrasted his own spending pattern\nwith his father\u2019s, and when Ramakrishna described himself as living\nfor the present, whereas his father lived for the future, he may have\nbeen exaggerating, but he did highlight a real difference between the\ngenerations about deferring material gratification.\nLinked to the younger generation\u2019s confidence is total disdain for\ngovernment and public-sector employment; the majority of young\npeople in ICS, Chakra and other private companies never even\nconsidered such jobs, except under pressure from their parents, and\nthe minority\u2014like Ravi and Shoaib\u2014who were offered them turned\nthem down. One ICS assistant manager even rejected a post in the\nprestigious Indian Space Research Organisation, because it would\nhave been unchallenging and monotonous. Since the late 1990s, the\nstate sector has been encouraging early retirement and recruiting\nnew personnel at a very low rate. Nevertheless, much more salient\nis the assumption that low salaries, bureaucratic hierarchies and\nstifling conservatism characterise these jobs, and given their sense\nof economic and occupational security, younger people see no point in\n\u2018safe\u2019 employment with the state (cf. Fernandes 2000: 92).\nFor Brahmans and other Forward Castes, the reservations policy\nis also relevant. In Tamilnadu, 68 per cent of state-sector posts\nand college seats are reserved for the Other Backward Classes and\nScheduled Castes and Tribes, and many people say that this is why\nmany private companies employ a lot of Brahmans. Yet reservations\nalone cannot fully explain upper-caste predominance in IT companies.\nOne important factor is that Brahmans in particular are nowadays an\nincreasingly urban population, who aremore likely than others to have\nthe social skills and cultural knowledge, including fluency in English,\nneeded to work in global IT companies and to pass their selection tests\nin the first place.\nThenotion thatBrahmans have a special aptitude for software owing\nto their traditional learning in abstract religion is fanciful, even if it\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESS IONALS 143\nis propounded by business commentators such as Das (2002: xvii), as\nwell asmanyTamil Brahmans themselves. Nonetheless, the high value\nthat Brahmans give to education, notably in mathematics and science,\nand their position as the best-educated community in Tamilnadu are\nundoubtedly important (Fuller 1999: 34\u20135; Subrahmanyan 1998: 67,\n88). In the early 1990s, Be\u00b4teille analysed the role of the family and\neducation in reproducing class inequality, observing that middle-class\nparents \u2018take an increasingly active part in their [children\u2019s] education\nand training. [They] have become increasingly career conscious, and\nthis consciousness is implanted in their children at a young age\u2019 (1991:\n17). This is still truer today and\u2014even more than in the 1970s, when\nLionel Caplan studied attitudes towards education among middle-\nclass Christians in Chennai (1987: 62\u20136)\u2014all middle-class children,\nencouraged and pressurised by their parents, know that they must\nstrive to gain the best possible examination marks. Brahman and\nForward Caste children, however, also know that they must secure\nexceptionally high examinationmarks to get into the best engineering\nand other professional colleges, where many seats are reserved.\nBecause ICS allows only candidates with consistently high marks to\napply for posts, its selection policy in practice favours Forward Caste\ncandidates who, from a tender age, have been motivated to achieve\nrepeated scholastic success. In fact, Forward Caste and especially\nBrahman beliefs about their unique need for very high marks are\nexaggerated.13 Nevertheless, they have a real impact, so that caste\nsignificantly affects how strongly children are socialised into their\neducation-oriented career consciousness, which is in turn salient for\nthe higher castes\u2019 over-representation in the professional middle\nclass.\nOur informants\u2019 disdain for government and public-sector\nemployment raises the question of their attitude to the Indian nation-\nstate. Satish Deshpande claims that the middle class\u2014especially its\n13 Figures for 2004 show that the \u2018cut-off marks\u2019 needed for admission to the\ntop engineering colleges are now not very much higher for the Forward Castes than\nfor others. Thus, for example, for the most competitive degree course\u2014electronics\nand communication at the top-ranking Anna University\u2014these marks were 293.28\n(out of 300) for Forward Caste candidates, and 290.57, 283.67 and 276.13 for\nBackward, Most Backward and Scheduled Castes respectively. The relative variation\nin cut-off marks was very similar for less competitive engineering courses (and highly\ncompetitivemedical colleges). See \u2018TamilNadu:Uncertainty continues in admissions\u2019,\nHindu, 27 April 2005.\n144 C . J . FULLER AND HARIPR IYA NARAS IMHAN\nupper, managerial-professional segment\u2014is the principal beneficiary\nof globalisation, and that \u2018much of the celebratory rhetoric about [it]\nemanates from, and is aimed at, this group\u2019 (2003: 150). Our evidence\nlargely confirms this; all IT professionals strongly support economic\nliberalisation and India\u2019s integration into the global economy (cf.\nUpadhya 2004), and so too do many manufacturing company\nmanagers, although enthusiasm is less in businesses that relied on\nthe old regulated economy (Harriss 2003: 339\u201340). Those who gain\nfrom expansion of the market economy can be expected to support it,\nof course, but Deshpande also argues that themanagerial-professional\nmiddle class formerly identified with Nehruvian development and, as\nglobalisation has displaced it, any commitment to the Indian nation\nhas faded away (2003: 150).\nAs Deshpande (ibid.: 147) admits, however, little empirical evidence\nexists about middle-class commitment to the \u2018Nehruvian enterprise\u2019,\nnotwithstanding the alliance between the state and industrial\ncapitalists (and other dominant classes), which has been identified\nas critical by political economists. In the 1960s, however, Be\u00b4teille\n(1969) pointed out that high-ranking administrators and professional\nintellectuals advising the government and its Planning Commission\u2014\nthe core of committed Nehruvians\u2014were a different social group,\nwith different interests, from other \u2018elite\u2019 sections, including business\nexecutives in private companies. Interestingly, some of our older\ninformants did speak positively about public-sector employment in\nthe past. Visvanathan, for instance, reminisced about his long career\nin Rourkela with colleagues from all over India in something akin to\nthe Nehruvian style discussed for the Bhilai steel plant by Jonathan\nParry (2003: 221\u20133). Several retired bank officers also explained how\nbank nationalisation in 1969, partly because it led to many more staff\ntransfers between regions, positively enhanced a sense of commitment\nto national development. Yet older people do not expect the younger\ngeneration, including their own children, to want to work for the\nstate, rather than better-run and better-paying private companies. In\nitself, though, this does not amount to retreat from Nehruvian ideas\nof progress, let alone from any patriotic commitment. Many older\ninformants, including those who worked for the government, tend to\ninsist that the state has become corrupt andno longer serves the nation\nand people. Moreover, everyone who favours economic liberalisation\nand globalisation also argues that they are the best means to national\neconomic development and prosperity, which the bureaucratic state\nand the old \u2018permit raj\u2019 failed to deliver.\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESS IONALS 145\nEmigration and Reverse Migration\nAttitudes to India and the nation-state are also highlighted by\nthe question of migration abroad, which Sampath blamed on \u2018peer\npressure\u2019 and many people in Chennai describe as a middle-class\n\u2018craze\u2019 or \u2018obsession\u2019. It is also commonly said that people mainly\nwant to work in IT so that they can go abroad, primarily to America.\nEven in the early 1980s, though, among the upper-middle-class people\nstudied by P. Caplan, \u2018there [was] scarcely a family that does not have\na close relative who has migrated [abroad]\u2019 (1985: 58) and in fact,\nas some informants recognise, the migration \u2018craze\u2019 long predates IT.\nThus another senior Chakra manager said that in the 1960s, when\nhe graduated from engineering college, the \u2018US craze\u2019 already existed\nand half his friends emigrated.\nYet the IT industry has brought about an important change. In\ntraditional engineering, as in many other professions, Indians who\nobtained jobs in foreign countries\u2014often after higher studies there\u2014\ntended to become Non-resident Indians (NRIs) living overseas on\na long-term or permanent basis. Of course, this was not always\ntrue, but well-qualified software engineers still have comparatively\ngreater freedom, because\u2014as ICS professionals illustrate\u2014they can\njoin global IT companies either in India or abroad, work on overseas\non-site assignments for shorter or longer periods, go abroad to earn a\nlot of money for a few years before returning home and, in general,\nmove in and out of India in a way that was uncommon in the past.\nThe IT industry certainly is a route for permanent emigration, but it\nalso enables considerable temporary emigration and reversemigration\nback to India.\nIn discussing Bangalore as a post-nationalist city, Sunil Khilnani\nrefers to a new professional class with \u2018a secessionist understanding\nof the idea of India\u2019 (1998: 148). Bangalore incarnates an image\nof modernity and an idea of India \u2018at sharp variance with Nehru\u2019s\none\u2019, and \u2018to the young MBA or software expert in Bangalore, India is\nmerely one stopping place in a global employmentmarket\u2019 (ibid.: 149).\nKhilnani cites no hard evidence for the latter claim, although Annalee\nSaxenian (2000: 265) reports that software companies in Bangalore\nin the 1990s had high staff turnovers, \u2018primarily because so many\nworkers jump at the first opportunity to emigrate\u2019. Saxenian, whose\nresearch focused on Indian and Chinese IT professionals in Silicon\nValley, says that although the \u2018brain drain\u2019 from India to America\ncontinued throughout the 1990s, \u2018a younger generation of Indian\n146 C . J . FULLER AND HARIPR IYA NARAS IMHAN\nengineers now expresses a desire to return home, which distinguishes\nthem from many of their predecessors\u2019 (ibid.: 267).14 Plainly, as most\nof our informants acknowledge, a lot of talk about reverse migration\nis still just talk; nonetheless, it is a real phenomenon that is almost\ncertainly growing.Moreover, it does not correspond at all to Khilnani\u2019s\nconcept of India as merely a stopping place, nor to the notion that\nIT professionals form a transnational class for whom attachments\nto particular localities no longer matter. Several of the ICS staff\ndiscussed above\u2014Ravi, Balaram, Anuradha and Jayashree, who are\nnot unusual\u2014worked overseas before choosing to return to Chennai,\nand we (with John Harriss) have also collected some data in three\nsmall, independent software companies founded by men who worked\nfor several years abroad, mainly in the US, before coming back home.\nOne consistent theme in all middle-class talk about overseas\nmigration, from India or back to it, is the care of elderly parents,\nalthough for people with children their upbringing and education\nare usually prominent as well. Many middle-class people in Chennai\ninsist that nowadays everyone has family members abroad. Chennai,\nconsequently, is said to be full of lonely old folk whose sons and\ndaughters send them dollars, but only ever come on short visits,\nwhereas other older people are continually visiting their offspring,\nso that they end up as bored, exploited childminders marooned\nin American suburbia under \u2018house arrest\u2019, to quote one elderly\ngrandfather.\nAll the talk about lonely old parents implies, as one informant\nspecifically said, that overseas migration damages the proper\nreciprocal relationship between parents and children in a way that\nmigration within India does not. Grown-up children resident overseas\ncan provide money, but, however well-meaning they are, they cannot\nprovide the personal care for aged parents that is part of an Indian\u2019s\ntraditional filial duty, so that emigration decisively undermines\nparent-child reciprocity within the family.15 In reality, children living\n14 Statistics from the 1990s and forward projections are not easy to interpret, but\nthey do suggest that a rise in both the outflow of IT workers and their return could\nsimultaneously occur (Kumar 2001: 4284\u20135).\n15 Chennai middle-class people, like other Indians including the Bengali villagers\ndescribed by Sarah Lamb, understand \u2018family relations as entailing long-term bonds\nof reciprocal indebtedness\u2019, and the primary reason why adult children should care for\ntheir aged parents is to repay \u2018the tremendous debts owed for producing and caring\nfor them in infancy and childhood\u2019 (Lamb 2000: 46). With some modifications\u2014\nfor example, that migration overseas, rather than to cities, is a problem\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESS IONALS 147\nin distant cities in India cannot provide personal care either, and\nmodern communicationsmaymean that e\u00b4migre\u00b4 children today keep in\ncloser touch with family members in Chennai than their predecessors\ncould do, whether they lived far away in India or overseas. Yet the\nmove abroad is seen as a potentially sharper break, because it could\nnot only destroy reciprocity between parents and adult children more\ndecisively, it could also totally detach a new generation of children\nborn and raised in foreign countries from their kin networks in India.\nOlder people with some or all of their children and grandchildren\nnow resident overseas generally recognise that they face a new and\nserious problem, and many, though not all, are realistic enough\nto accept that they have to deal with it by reorganising their\nrelationships with all their adult children. Because children working\nabroad normally return for only occasional short visits, older people\nbelieve that they should go and stay with them for extended periods,\ndespite boredom and \u2018house arrest\u2019. During these visits, they can\nlook after their grandchildren, which is generally seen as a valuable\ncontribution, and perhaps teach them some religious traditions, which\nhelps to counteract the corroding materialism of western society.\nHowever, if there are also grandchildren in Chennai, foreign visits\ndisrupt their childcare arrangements. Because working couples in the\ncity commonly rely heavily on their parents for help with childcare,\nthe travel plans of both sets of parents become critical to their own\ndomestic arrangements and may in turn cause tensions between\nsiblings and affines. Then sensitive inter-family negotiations are often\nimperative and are made worse if elderly people\u2014rather like their\npeers in Calcutta (Donner 2005: 121\u20134)\u2014resent being exploited as\nhard-working childminderswhen they had looked forward to a peaceful\nretirement.\nAs already mentioned, many professional emigrants have left India\npermanently to join the NRI population. Today\u2019s IT professionals,\nhowever, may choose not to follow them. Talk about migration is\nalways also about career opportunities and living standards, and many\npeople in the IT sector\u2014much more so than in manufacturing\u2014\nnow insist that the conditions of life and work in Chennai are\nimproving so rapidly that the relative attraction of foreign countries,\n(ibid.: 91\u20132)\u2014complaints about \u2018the degenerate ways of modern society\u2019 (ibid.: 88)\nand their effect on care of the elderly are very similar in Chennai and the Bengali\nvillage.\n148 C . J . FULLER AND HARIPR IYA NARAS IMHAN\nnotably America, is declining.16 Current US policy on immigration\nand visas is, of course, one major factor. More significant, though, is\nthe conviction that the IT industry\u2019s evolution will ensure that the\namount of high value-added work done offshore in India will steadily\nexpand in comparison with on-site work done overseas, and we have\nnot heard IT professionals in Chennai complain that they are cheap\nlabour whose work is taken for granted (cf. Upadhya 2004: 5149).\nFor men and women with the skills needed by large companies like\nICS, or by the numerous small ones that have carved out their own\nniche in the software sector, the further development of the global\nIT industry does not require them to treat Chennai or Bangalore as\nway stations en route to foreign countries. In fact, almost the opposite\nis true; IT professionals need not choose, once and for all, between\nbeing resident and non-resident Indians, because they can fairly easily\ngo away and then return. Furthermore, at least in their own eyes,\nthey are not selfish materialists with a secessionist understanding of\nIndia, but modern professionals whose well-paid work in a new global\nindustry enables them to lead better lives with their own families\naccording to their own traditions in their own country. They are not\nNehruvian nationalists, but, perhaps paradoxically, the professionals\nwho are crucially responsible for building a global economy based on\ninformation technology may become more committed to living their\nlives in India than many of their predecessors in India\u2019s aspirational\nmiddle class.\nReferences\nArun, Shoba, and Arun, Thankom.
