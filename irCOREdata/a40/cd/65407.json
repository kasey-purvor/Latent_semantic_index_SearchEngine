In order to \ninvestigate the dual involvement of two areas, namely right posterior parietal cortex \n(PPC) and lateral occipital cortex (LO), in a distance discrimination task, neural \nprocessing in both areas was concurrently disrupted using dual site TMS. Although \nthere was no change in error rates, reaction time was significantly lengthened over \nthat seen with TMS over either site alone. This additive effect indicates that both PPC \nand LO are concurrently active and essential for efficient processing of this task. The \nsecond experiment investigated the specificity of function within the ventral stream. \nPerformance was assessed for distance and  shape discrimination when TMS was \napplied to our original LO site and an area rostral to V5 but still part of the lateral \noccipital complex (rostral LOC) that is activated in form and colour discrimination. \nPerformance deficits were restricted to TMS over LO; no significant impairment for \neither task followed TMS at the rostral LOC site.  \n \nKeywords: Ventral Stream, Dorsal Stream, visual discrimination, transcranial \nmagnetic stimulation. \n 3 \nIntroduction \nThe main cortical processing pathways that underlie visual perception and its motor \nconsequences are often characterised as the dorsal and ventral anatomical streams. \nFunctionally however, the two streams have attracted different terms, from \nUngerleider and Mishkin\u201fs (1982) \u201cWhat and Where\u201d pathways to Goodale and \nMilner\u201fs (1992) \u201cWhat and How\u201d pathways. The latter appellation encompasses an \noccipito-temporal pathway involved in object and colour recognition and an occipito-\nparietal pathway terminating within the intraparietal sulcus and concerned with \nvisuomotor transformations. Distinct from this pathway, but implicit to Ungerleider \nand Mishkin\u201fs model, is another area specialised for visuospatial computation and \ncentred more inferiorly in the posterior parietal cortex. Patients with visual neglect \ncaused by damage here have deficits in processing line bisection or landmark tasks. \nHowever, when such patients are asked to point to the centre of a screen or outlined \nsquare they can do so (Barltelomeo et al., 2003) possibly, but still far from clearly, by \nmaking a visual discrimination based on shape rather than lateral extent and thereby \nrecruiting their undamaged ventral stream. \n \nWe have previously investigated the specialisation of each of these streams by using \ntranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to disrupt cortical processing with respect to \nthree tasks thought to probe functioning in one or other stream: a task requiring \nrelative spatial distance discrimination, a task requiring shape discrimination, and a \ntask requiring colour discrimination (Ellison and Cowey 2006). We probed the \ninvolvement of an area of the ventral stream, the lateral occipital cortex (LO), an area \nknown to be important in object recognition (Ferber et al., 2005; Avidan et al., 2003; \nLearner et al., 2002; Kourzi & Kanwisher, 2001) and compared the behavioural effect \n 4 \nof TMS to that seen when TMS is applied to right inferior posterior parietal cortex \n(PPC), known to have visuospatial specialisation (Ellison et al., 2003; Bjoertomt et \nal., 2002, 2008). We would have expected an involvement of PPC in the spatial \ndistance discrimination task and an involvement of LO in the object discrimination \nand colour task. However, although the results revealed a dissociation between \nstreams, it was not as clear-cut as previously thought. Neither area seemed to have an \nessential functional specialisation for the colour task, presumably because areas V4 \nand\/or V8 are more ventral, beyond the effect of TMS, and are sufficient to subserve \nthe colour task we used; and\/or area LO is not critical to its processing (Cant & \nGoodale, 2007). Our results also showed that there are regionally separable processes \nin the brain for shape-based discrimination and a, albeit less clear, dissociation for a \nspatial discrimination. On the basis of a neuroimaging study, Fink et al. (1997) \nsuggested that \u201cobject-based and space-based attention share a common neural \nmechanism in the parietal lobe\u201d. If this were the case, we should have seen \ninvolvement of the right PPC in both the object and spatial discriminations, which we \ndid not. Instead, our finding suggests that spatial discrimination recruits a mechanism \nused in object processing but not vice-versa. \n \nPerhaps the dorsal and ventral pathways are processing our \u201cdistance\u201d task in \ndifferent ways, i.e. PPC is basing its analysis on visuospatial properties but LO is \nusing shape information to complete the task. It is also possible that the two pathways \ninteract in order to process the task, with LO providing shape information and PPC \nspatial information. Both of these hypotheses are consistent with the behavioural \neffect of increased reaction times with TMS at either site. If the relative timing of \ninvolvement of PPC and LO could be determined, the results should help in deciding \n 5 \nbetween these two possibilities. If LO and PPC are simultaneously active in parallel  \nthey would seem to be processing the task according to their own functional \nspecialisation, be it for shape or space. But if consecutive peaks of TMS interference \nare seen, it is more likely that LO and PPC work in sequence in order to accomplish \nthe task. Ellison and Cowey (2007) investigated this  formulation  by using double \npulse TMS to provide a brief disruption window of 100ms. Results showed that TMS \nover LO has an earlier and significantly greater peak of activation than that over PPC, \nindicating that the ventral stream has a greater earlier involvement in the processing of \nthis visuospatial task and consistent with our previous conclusion that its involvement \nis based on the shape processing for which the ventral stream is specialised (Kourzi & \nKanwisher, 2001; Malach et al., 1995). Accordingly, and in contrast, the later \ninvolvement of PPC is presumably based on its established visuo-spatial \nspecialisation (Ellison et al., 2003; Bjoertomt et al., 2002, 2008). \n \nAn apparent paradox of our previous studies however is that we were unable to \nestablish any performance deficit (i.e. decreases in accuracy) in these tasks despite \nrobust and replicable reaction time effects. One reason why this may be so in the \nvisuospatial distance discrimination is the joint ability of PPC and LO to process the \ntask in their different ways, thereby making subjects slower to process the task but \nwithout abolishing their ability to do it. Therefore, Experiment 1 in the present study \nwas designed to disrupt processing concurrently at both PPC and LO. This should \nhave the effect of increasing reaction times more than that induced by TMS over \neither site alone, and could even impair the accuracy of response. Alternatively, if \nreaction times are not significantly greater with dual site TMS this would indicate that \nLO and PPC do not have an additive effect on processing of this distance task and that \n 6 \neach area is involved according to its specialisation i.e. information from both regions \nis not necessary to complete the task.  \n \nAs several functional imaging experiments point to the activation of a further and \nmore rostral region of lateral occipital cortex of the ventral stream in the \ndiscrimination of shape (Doninger et al., 2000; Grill-Spector et al., 1998; Grill-\nSpector et al., 2001), Experiment 2 examines whether TMS above this region \nreproduces the effects of TMS over LO. Therefore, Experiment 2 examined this area\u201fs \ninvolvement in our original distance and shape discrimination. \n \nMethods \nSubjects \n8 healthy subjects, aged 20-43 (4 females, 4 males) participated in Experiment 1. 10 \nhealthy subjects (6 common to Experiment 1), aged 20-43 (5 females, 5 males) \nparticipated in Experiment 2. They were all right handed with normal or corrected to \nnormal vision. Subjects gave their signed informed consent in accordance with the \nDeclaration of Helsinki and with the approval of Durham University Ethics Advisory \nCommittee, and could leave the experiment at any point. Subject selection complied \nwith current guidelines for rTMS research (Wasserman 1998). \n \n 7 \nStimuli \nAll stimuli were presented on a 32 cm x 24 cm VDU driven by a Pentium-4 PC \nprogrammed in E-Prime (Psychology Software Tools, Inc). Subjects sat 57.5 cm away \nfrom the screen with the centre of the screen at eye level. The subject\u201fs head and trunk \nsagittal midline were aligned with the centre of the screen, with head position \ncontrolled by a chinrest.  \n \nVisual Tasks \nOne visual task, involving a relative distance discrimination, was used in Experiment \n1 and three visual tasks (distance, shape and colour) were used in Experiment 2.. \nHowever, the reaction times for the colour task had a high variance and although per \ncent correct performance was matched to that of the two other tasks the mean reaction \ntimes for colour were also much faster than for space and shape. For these  reasons the  \nresults for colour, which was not central to the main point of the investigation have \nnot been presented. The threshold for 80 per cent correct performance in each task had \nfirst to be determined, prior to any experimental TMS blocks, so that tasks were \nmatched as closely as possible for difficulty. In all tasks one item was presented in the \ncentre of the screen with two items presented at a lateral eccentricity, one either side \nof the horizontal midline as detailed below (see Figure 1). Each trial began with \n500ms central fixation cross (0.5\u00ba x 0.5\u00ba) after which the three stimuli were presented \nfor 500ms, one of them replacing the fixation cross. The background colour was grey \n(CIE: x = 0.268, y = 0.295) with a luminance of 37cd\/m\n2\n. When the stimuli \ndisappeared the entire screen instantly changed in luminance and a question box, \nasking the subject \u201cwhich item was closer (or the same shape) as the central item, was \npresented in the centre, entirely covering the previous position of the three stimuli. \n 8 \nThis box remained until the subject responded. It therefore also served to backward-\nmask the stimulus display, making it impossible for the subject to use any retinal \npersistence to solve the task. There was a 4000ms interval between trials. Task \ndifficulty was titrated by making it progressively more or less difficult according to \nthe following rule. Difficulty was modulated after each set of five trials. After five \nconsecutive correct responses difficulty was increased by one step (steps are described \nin detail below in the description of each task). If two or more incorrect responses out \nof five were made, the difficulty was decreased by one step. If there was just 1 error in \n5 trials there was no change.  Performance was stabilised when performance reached \n80% correct (4 out of five) in two subsequent sets. In the subsequent testing sessions \nsubjects were asked to respond as quickly and as accurately as they could but without \nsacrificing accuracy for speed. \n \nDistance Task:   \nStimuli were presented as 3 green (11 cd\/m\n2\n, 1\u00ba x 1\u00ba) squares. One square was \npresented in the centre of the screen, the other two 5\u00ba to the left of the vertical \nmidline. One square (either the top or the bottom at random) was always 3\u00ba above or \nbelow the horizontal midline. The other square was initially presented at a vertical \neccentricity of 4 degrees from the horizontal meridian and progressively it approached \nit in 0.2\u00ba steps until the threshold for 80% correct was reached. The experimental \nvalue of the distance of the furthest object from the centre was then set at 0.2\u00ba more \nthan the threshold value found. The subject was asked to respond by indicating which \nof the two eccentric squares was closest to the central square by pressing the bottom \nbutton on a keypad if the bottom item was closest and the top button if it was the top \nitem. The top square was the closer item in 50% of trials, at random. See Figure 1. \n 9 \n \nShape task: \nTwo shape sets comprised this task. The first set consisted of a central square (1\u00ba x 1\u00ba) \nand in the other set the central shape was an oblong of equal area, subtending 1.47\u00ba x \n0.69\u00ba. Stimuli were presented in the same format as the distance task but position was \nfixed 5 degrees to the left of the vertical midline and 4\u00ba either side of the horizontal \nmidline (see Figure 1). One of the eccentric shapes differed from the central shape by \n0.5\u00ba in the x and y axis (in order to maintain equal area) initially. It approached the \nshape of the central item in 0.1 degree steps until threshold was reached for 80% \ncorrect. On half of the trials, at random, the central shape was the square and on the \nother half it was the oblong. The experimental value of the shape different from that \nin the centre was then set to be 0.1\u00ba larger than the threshold value found. The subject \nhad respond by indicating which item was the same shape as the item in the centre by \npressing the top or bottom button on a keypad as before The top item was the same \nshape in 50% of trials. See Figure 1. \n \nFIGURE 1 about here please \nTMS \nExperiment 1:  \nTwo Magstim\u2122 SuperRapid magnetic stimulators (Magstim, Whitland, \nCarmarthenshire, Wales) were used to apply pulses at 10Hz for 500ms at 65% of the \nstimulator\u201fs maximum power (i.e. 1.3 Tesla). This level of stimulation is just greater \nthan the intensity required to induce movement (when applied over motor cortex) or \nthe perception of phosphenes (over primary visual cortex, V1). The TMS train of 5 \npulses began at stimulus onset in each case. \n 10 \n \nTMS was applied simultaneously over two sites of the right hemisphere previously \ninvestigated in isolation: an area corresponding to lateral occipital cortex (LO) and \nposterior parietal cortex (PPC). LO was stimulated using a 50mm figure-of-eight \nbranding iron coil. PPC was stimulated using a 70mm coil placed tangential to the \nskull, with the handle pointing forwards, parallel to the mid-sagittal plane. Both coils \nwere held in place by the experimenters. These different coil sizes and configurations \nwere used in order that the two coils could be positioned over occipito-parietal cortex \nof one hemisphere.  \nRight PPC was identified by using a hunting procedure with the hard conjunction \ntask, as described in Ashbridge et al. (1997) in which 10 trials of TMS are given to \neach site in a 3 x 3 grid (adjacent points 1 cm apart) around a central point 9 cm dorsal \nto the mastoid-inion and 6cm lateral to the right. The \u201chotspot\u201d for activation is \ndenoted by a roughly 100ms increase in reaction time over the trials in which no TMS \nwas administered. The position of this area as co-registered with cortical position \nusing BrainSight software (Rogue Research ) is shown in Figure 1. The LO site was \nchosen in relation to area right V5 (generally corresponding to 3cm above the \nmastoid-inion and 5cm lateral to the right) which was then precisely identified by \nlocalising the area where a train of TMS pulses (10Hz, 500ms) elicited the strongest \nand most salient moving phosphenes (see Schenk et al., 2005) at the lowest TMS \nintensity. LO was then calculated to be 1-1.5cm caudal on the skull in a direct line \nfrom there towards the inion. This area can be seen to correspond well anatomically \nwith lateral occipital cortex. (see Figure 1). \n \n 11 \nA control site (vertex) was also stimulated to control for non-specific effects that may \nresult from TMS being administered at two sites. In this, and the two following \nexperiments, TMS was only administered after thresholds for 80% correct \nperformance had been determined for each subject. During blocks of TMS the display \nparameters were never changed, i.e. the method of constant stimuli was used.    Trials \nwere administered in ten blocks of 40 trials each block randomised across subjects to \nminimise either order or practice effects; two blocks with sham TMS with a non-\ndischarging coil held over both LO and PPC sites, two blocks with TMS over LO and \nPPC in each trial, two blocks with TMS applied over LO alone (and a non-discharging \ncoil held over the PPC site), two blocks with TMS applied over PPC alone (and a \nnon-discharging coil held over the LO site) and finally two blocks with TMS applied \nover either PPC or LO and vertex. In sham TMS, a coil discharged in close proximity \nto the subjects\u201f right so that the subjective experience of the noise associated with a \nTMS pulse was the same as was the tactile experience of a coil placed on the head, \nhowever no pulse was administered to the brain. The testing session usually lasted no \nmore than 1.5 hours.  \nExperiment 2: \nOne Magstim\u2122 SuperRapid magnetic stimulator was used to apply pulses at 10Hz for \n500ms at 65% of the stimulator\u201fs maximum power (i.e. 1.3 Tesla).TMS was applied \nover two areas using two  70mm figure-of-eight coils held in place by the \nexperimenter and placed tangential to the skull with the handle pointing backward, \nparallel to the horizontal and mid-sagittal plane. The two areas of interest were LO \n(located via the procedure outlined in Experiment 1) and an area 1 \u2013 1.5 cm rostral to \nV5 (which was located in the same manner as in Experiment 1 above). The same \n 12 \ndownward angle of a tangent from V5 to inion for location of LO was employed to \nlocate this site (rostral LOC). \n \nEach of the tasks (distance and shape) were tested in blocks of 40 trials at each site \n(LO, rostral LOC) and there was also a block of sham TMS. The order of TMS \ncondition and task was randomised within and across subjects to minimise practice \neffects. \n \n 13 \nResults \nAll data were included in accuracy analysis but for the analysis of reaction times \noutliers beyond \u00b12 standard deviations of the mean were excluded.  \n \nExperiment 1: \nThresholds \nThe mean threshold achieved across subjects in the distance task was a difference of \n0.24\u00ba  0.17\u00ba for 80% correct. This led to a mean fixed distance of 0.40  0.22 for the \nfurthest square in the subsequent experimental sessions with real or sham TMS. \n \nTMS effects \nThere was no significant difference between the effect of TMS on reaction times \nwhen it was applied (a) over LO alone or  LO+vertex, or (b) when it was applied over \nPPC alone or PPC+vertex. Therefore in the subsequent analyses the results within \neach of (a) and (b) were collapsed. \n \nA one-factor (TMS condition) repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant \ndifference across all TMS conditions [sham TMS, LO+PPC, LO, PPC] (F(3, 21) = \n5.644, p = 0.005). Subsequent paired t-tests reveal a significant effect of TMS in each \ncondition (LO: t = -3.794, df = 7, p = 0.007; PPC: t = 3.440, df = 7, p = 0.011; \nLO+PPC: t = -2.828, df = 7, p = 0.025). \n \nAn investigation of the speed\/accuracy trade-off across conditions was carried out \nusing an Inverse Efficiency Analysis (median\/proportion of correct responses: \nTownsend and Ashby, 1983). There was no significant difference in this value across \n 14 \nconditions as indicated by a one factor repeated measures ANOVA (F(3, 21) = 2.379, p \n= 0.073). \n \nReaction times resulting from TMS at each site were normalised with respect to the \nbaseline (sham) reaction time according to the following formula [TMSx \u2013 sham \nTMS]\/sham TMS x 100, where x denotes the TMS condition, in order to calculate the \neffect of TMS in each condition (see Figure 2) for comparison across conditions. \nThere was a significant difference of TMS effect across conditions (F(2,14) = 4.853, p = \n0.025, see Figure 2).  \nFIGURE 2 about here please \n \nThe mean error rate \u00b1 standard error across all sites was 85.61 \u00b1 0.50 and as can be \nseen from Figure 3, no significant differences were noted between conditions. \n \nFIGURE 3 about here please \n \nExperiment 2: \nThresholds \nThe mean threshold achieved across subjects in the distance task was a difference of \n0.25\u00ba  0.14\u00ba for 80% correct. This provided a mean fixed distance of 0.39  0.19 for \nthe furthest square in the subsequent experimental task. In the shape task, \nperformance reached threshold at a 0.09\u00ba  0.05\u00ba difference in shape, leading to a \nmean fixed 0.15\u00ba  0.08\u00ba difference in the experimental session. Across both tasks, the \nchosen stimulus values corresponded to about 90% correct in each subject to \n 15 \nmaximise the effect of TMS on reaction time in each task without encountering the \nproblem of ceiling effects. \n \nTMS effects \nThere was no significant effect of TMS on error rates at either site in either task. \nHowever, a two factor (task [distance, shape] x TMS [LO, rostral LOC, sham]) \nrepeated measures ANOVA revealed a main effect of TMS (F(2, 18) = 6.095, p = 0.010) \non reaction times. In order to further investigate these differences two paired t-tests \nwere carried out per task. TMS over LO in both the distance task and shape task \nresulted in significant increases in reaction time (distance: t = -2.607, df = 9, p = \n0.028; shape: t = -5.136, df = 9, p = 0.001).  \n \nFigure 4 about here please \n  \nA two factor (task [distance, shape] x TMS [LO, rostral LOC] repeated measures \nANOVA carried out to investigate the effect of TMS over each site revealed a main \neffect of TMS (F(2, 1) = 14.067, p = 0.005).  Further post-hoc paired t-tests revealed \nthat this results from a significantly greater effect on reaction times when TMS was \napplied to LO over that seen at the rostral LOC site in the distance task (t = 2.277, df \n= 9, p = 0.049) and the shape task (t = 4.151, df = 9, p = 0.002) when normalised \nreaction times were compared as above.  \n \n 16 \nDiscussion \nExperiment 1 replicated our previous finding that TMS disrupts processing within \nright LO and PPC, by significantly lengthening reaction times in a visuospatial \ndistance discrimination.  Therefore both areas must be involved in the processing of \nthis task, if only one area was necessary, no additive effect would be seen. What is the \nnature of their involvement? LO seems to have a functional specialisation for shape in \nagreement with neuropsychological results (Goodale et al., 1994) and functional \nimaging (Kourtzi and Kanwisher, 2001; Malach et al., 1995). It seems reasonable to \nassume that some shape based processing must contribute to how the brain computes \nthe distance discrimination, thus reinforcing the dissociation reported by Bartelomeo \nand colleagues (2003) that when patients with left neglect are asked to point to the \nmiddle of a screen or shape they are unimpaired, presumably as a result of their intact \nventral stream.  \n \nThe current study sought to investigate the effect that simultaneous disruption to both \nareas LO and PPC would have on performance. Whilst a performance deficit in terms \nof accuracy was again absent, dual-site TMS does in fact further lengthen reaction \ntimes. This is additional evidence that PPC and LO are both necessary for the most \nefficient processing of this task. The finding cannot be explained by the fact that there \nwere two discharging coils on the head at the same time as no significant difference \nwas found between conditions when vertex plus either LO or PPC was also stimulated \nas a control site. Although it would seem that each area can process this task \naccording to its functional specialisation, it may be that both areas must ideally be \nactive in order to process this task quickly and efficiently. There is already tentative \nevidence for such a co-operative account from a timing study that found LO had a \n 17 \ngreater and earlier peak of disruption than PPC in this task (Ellison & Cowey, 2007). \nThe question remains however as to whether or not processing at PPC is contingent \non this earlier information from LO.  \n \nGiven that two areas specialised for the processing of this task were simultaneously \ndisrupted, it might seem unusual that although response times were lengthened, \naccuracy in terms of per cent correct performance was unchanged, especially in view \nof performance decrements in earlier studies. Two notable examples of the latter are \nthose of Corthout et al. (1999), in which a single pulse of TMS between 20-60ms or \nbetween 100 and 140ms post visual stimulus onset substantially impaired letter \nrecognition, and Cowey et al. (2006) in which 10Hz repetitive pulse TMS over \nV5\/MT impaired the discrimination of the direction of global motion in random dot \nkinematograms. The reason why effects on accuracy occurred in these two studies \nmay stem from the nature of their design. Corthout et al. (1999) used very brief, \nsingle frame, display times, enabling one pulse to impair processing of a letter that \nwas present for as little as 2-3 msec. Although Cowey et al. (2006) used six pulses of \nrTMS at 10 Hz for half a second, the moving elements in the half-second visual \ndisplay were present for only one frame (45 msec) before \u201ejumping\u201f to a new position \non the next frame. This means that on half of the 12 frames the change of position \nwould be disrupted by a pulse of TMS. In contrast, our displays were unchanging \nthroughout the 500 ms display period. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that \nalthough TMS is disrupting processing for a brief period within each 100 ms inter-\npulse-interval, it never completely interferes with the relevant information on which \ndiscrimination is based. Instead, it merely delays processing by the summed brief \nperiods of disruption. This is also the reason why a 500ms period of 10 Hz TMS does \n 18 \nnot result in an increase of 500 ms in reaction time (see Walsh and Cowey, 2000). In \nour tasks, it is also the reason why there is no impairment of accuracy in performance; \nthe disruption merely introduces a time delay in the processing that leads to accurate \nperformance. \n \nA further possible explanation for TMS lengthening reaction times without impairing \naccuracy is that TMS does reduce the visibility of the stimuli and that retinal \npersistence after both the display and the TMS have ended allows the subject to \ncontinue gathering and analysing information for several ms. This was not possible in \nthe present experiment because the stimuli were masked immediately after they \ndisappeared by the question box in the centre of the screen. It is also possible that \nTMS simply slows the cortical processing being carried out in the area beneath the \ncoil such that subjects reach their decision slightly later but still before the end of the \ndisplay. However, neither of these possibilities affects the task dependent regional \nspecificity that was revealed, nor the additive affect of dual-site stimulation.     \n \nExperiment 2 tested the specificity of area LO in the processing of tasks involving \ndiscrimination of distance and shape. Several recent studies (such as Grill-Spector et \nal., 1998; Doninger et al., 2000; but see Grill-Spector et al., 2001 for review) \nprovided evidence that the entire lateral occipital complex (LOC), from LO caudally \nto regions extending anteriorly and ventrally into posterior temporal cortex, respond \nmore strongly to intact objects with clear shape interpretations than to control stimuli \nthat do not depict clear shapes. The effects seen in our previous study (Ellison & \nCowey, 2006) were replicated in the present study with TMS above area LO but not \nabove rostral LOC. Indeed as Grill-Spector et al. (2001) point out, while LOC is \n 19 \nactivated strongly in fMRI experiments when subjects view pictures of objects, this \ndoes not by itself prove that it is the locus in the brain that performs object \nrecognition. We have now shown, via neuro-disruption, a dissociation of function \nbetween two distinct regions of the lateral occipital complex, namely area LO and \nrostral LOC. \n \n 20 \nReferences \n \nAshbridge, E., Walsh, V., Cowey, A.
