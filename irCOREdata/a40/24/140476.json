It briefly explores how the structure\nof the automotive supply chain is changing due to the pressures of increasing complexity and urgency. Then it\nhighlights the inevitability of instability in the supply chain, through a discussion on turbulence. Agility is\nidentified as a response for coping with this uncertainty. The tool identified for introducing agility in the supply\nchain is Virtual Teaming. It achieves this by forming collaborative supply chain partnerships, unconstrained by\ngeography that can quickly apply knowledge and expertise as corrective and preventive mechanisms. A survey\nof the suppliers to a major automotive manufacturer has highlighted the need for this form of working.\nA major function of the information flows in the supply chain is in providing control information. This function\nis threatened because the structure of the supply chain is changing due to the pressures of increasing complexity\nand urgency. Tiered supply chains can lead to an increasing possibility of disturbances in the material flow in the\nsupply change, often initiated by frequent and unexpected changes in demand. These disturbances have been\ntermed \"turbulence\", which can be classified in five categories, design, volume, mix, schedule and process [1]. A\nnumber of approaches such as concurrent engineering and late configuration [2] have been proposed to reduce\nturbulence. However these do not reduce the occurrence of some of the more advanced forms of dynamic\nbehaviour [3]. It is proposed that what is needed is a context in which human knowledge and expertise can be\nbrought to bear. The article examines the agility strategy for competitiveness in changing market conditions and\nparticularly Goldman et al.'s [4] proposals for agile supply chains that exhibit high degrees of reward,\nenrichment and linkage amongst members: ideas that are congruent with needing to inject human knowledge and\nexpertise. One of the barriers to direct human interaction in the supply chain is, however, the geographical\nseparation of its members. Virtual teaming is proposed as the model and practice that can overcome this\ngeographical barrier. A virtual team, composed of members of the supply chain and using advanced\ncommunications technology, can improve the flow of information and quickly dampen turbulence through the\nability of members to behave as a team, sharing knowledge and expertise, regardless of location. However,\nbuilding effective virtual teams requires an organisation to tackle several technology, process and people related\nfactors [5], while Clegg et al. [6] warn that technology factors typically receive attention at the expense of non-\ntechnology factors, thus impeding the success of many IT-based processes. The article presents overview data\nfrom two research programs on virtual teaming in the automotive supply chain. The data shows recognition of\nthe promise of virtual teaming, in terms of \"better, faster, cheaper\" benefits, but also revealed significant barriers\nto successful implementation in the non-technology, process and teaming areas.\nInformation and Expertise\nThe convergence of fundamental manufacturing trends, increasing complexity and increasing urgency is forecast\nto continue. The prime resources utilised to tackle this convergence are data and information. We can and do\napply database systems, management information systems and increasingly, knowledge-based systems to help\nmanufacturing cope. It has long been recognised that effective information flow is crucial for an efficient supply\nchain. The supply chain needs to transmit Value & Demand information up the chain and Cost & Supply\ninformation down the chain with sufficient detail and timeliness to avoid instability (see Figure 1). Instability can\noccur because of the variable time delays and multiple information paths that can exist. The success of a\nparticular supply chain depends on its ability to intercept and respond to these two information flows, and the\nclarity and speed of the overall information flows control the health of the whole supply chain.\nInsert Figure 1: Information Flow in the Value System\nAdopting a control systems analogy, this information, if timely and sufficient, provides the feedforward and\nfeedback necessary to maintain stability in the system. The model illustrated in Figure 1 is widely accepted, but\nwhat could provide better control than data or information? Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between data,\ninformation, knowledge and expertise. Data placed in context creates information, information analysed over a\nperiod of time generates knowledge and knowledge applied skilfully is expertise!\nInsert Figure 2: The relationship between data and expertise\nThe potential for instability is inherent in the supply chain because of the variable delays and multiple\nfeedback and feedforward loops that can occur. Since knowledge and expertise are richer, more robust entities\nthan data or information, they may be able to provide better feedforward and feedback control than information.\nExpertise however is difficult to capture in a system, and is usually in short supply. This expertise needs to come\nfrom all the components of the supply chain.\nInstability in the supply chain\nSupply management must be able to cope with the effects of demand instability but, for manufacturing\ncompanies, good supplier performance by itself does not mean that the whole supply chain is being properly\nmanaged. Even when problems relating to material availability are completely overcome, manufacturing may\nbecome a source of disturbance in the supply chain [7]. The concept of turbulence proposed by Bhattacharya et\nal [8] is useful for identifying the usual contributors to the instability that can arise in a supply chain. Comparing\nproduction flow with fluid flow, and manufacturing constraints with a pipe, Bhattacharya et al show that in a\nrigid pipeline, variability and uncertainty of inputs - which in this case represent the demand - may cause \"swirls,\nblockages and pileups\". Here, the fluid flow struggles to adapt to the form of the pipe (Figure 2). Those\ndisturbances in the production flow caused by frequent and unexpected changes in demand are called\n\"turbulence\". Bhattacharya et al. classify turbulence in five categories; design, volume, mix, schedule and\nprocess. Three of them will be used in the present analysis; design, volume and mix.\nDesign turbulence relates to disturbances caused in the production flow by changes in product design. This\nkind of turbulence is very likely to occur when manufactured products have short life cycles or go through\nnumerous design changes within their life cycle. This is precisely the case in mass customised markets such as\nthose the automotive industry is tending to [9].\nVolume turbulence is a consequence of changes in total production volumes and usually occurs in the form\nof capacity constraints or materials shortage. Manufacturing has to work with very short planning horizons and\nconsequently may be prone to volume turbulence. Because products in mass customised markets have short life\ncycles it is difficult to buffer variations in demand (even when they are expected) by building stocks. This is a\nparticular problem in tiered supply chains as seen in major sectors like automotive and aerospace. An Original\nEquipment Manufacturer (OEM) may have problems in the supply chain due to an aggregation\/reduction of\ndemand lower down in the supply chain. For example a fourth or fifth tier supplier will see overall demand from\nthe OEM coming from different second or third tier suppliers. They may well see their demand change massively\nas a result of changes emanating from the OEM, even though the OEM is not visible to them as a customer.\nThrough the structuring of the supplier chain demand can be made to appear piecemeal to core component\nsuppliers at the bottom of the supply chain, e.g. the suppliers of integrated circuits and electronic components.\nThey see relatively small orders from a number of customers, who may be supplying the OEM. In the event of\nshortages in supply, a relatively common event in the world electronics industry, they may well allocate supplies\nto large customers, which the OEM will not appear to be, because its is hidden by the tiers of the supply chain.\nInsert Figure 3: The Turbulence Pipeline\nMix turbulence relates to the disturbances caused not by a change in the total production volume (which in\nthis case can even remain quite steady) but by a change in the distribution of the volumes of the different\nproducts (or product models) manufactured in the same facility. Changes in the mix of products may lead to\nchanges in loading among the different machining cells. If a machining cell is subject to a sudden increase in its\ninputs, and is not able to respond with a corresponding increase in its processing rates, it may become a\nbottleneck causing mix turbulence.\nThe difficulty of managing an complex an entity as the supply chain has pushed organisations to adopt\ninitiatives such as concurrent engineering and late configuration, which attempt to remove some of the causes of\nturbulence, and thus reduce costs and time-to-solution. Concurrent engineering techniques offer an\norganisational methodology to reduce design turbulence [10]. The multi-disciplinary design team proposed by\nthis approach brings a kind of holistic awareness into the design phase. Through involving people from different\ndepartments such as marketing, finance, purchasing, manufacturing and outbound logistics in the design phase,\nthe need for design rework is reduced and the impact of introducing new products in the production process is\nattenuated. Design for manufacturing and design for assembly, which are branches of concurrent engineering,\nmay also help to attenuate mix turbulence by avoiding parts proliferation and reducing manufacturing and\nassembling complexity. \"Intelligent\" design techniques aim to create product variation that looks very different\nfrom the customer's point of view while being quite similar from the manufacturer's point of view.\nAt production level, late configuration may be used to reduce mix turbulence. In this case most of the parts\nand subassemblies are manufactured and assembled on a made-to-stock basis. However, the final customer-\nspecified product is manufactured on a make-to-order basis. There will be a waiting time between the order point\nand the product delivery, during which the manufacturer will be processing the \"off-the-shelf\" characteristics of\nthe product. This approach is used in markets where the demand for each particular model of one product is so\nirregular that it is impossible to make detailed forecasts about it. Kitchens, cars and personal computers are\nexamples of markets where this approach has been followed.\nA further source of uncertainty that in recent years has received increasing recognition is the generation of\ndeterministic chaos within the industrial environment. Deterministic chaos can be defined as \"Random behavior\ngoverned entirely by laws\" [11]. Control algorithms and heuristics used within the supply chain can generate\nrandom demands on other parts of the system. Stacey [12] has discussed this type of behaviour with reference to\nthe strategic management process. Mosekilde et al. [13] have demonstrated that human decision-making\nbehaviour can generate deterministic chaos in simple industrial management decisions. Wilding [14] has\ndemonstrated that inventory control algorithms can generate chaos within simple supply chains. It should be\nemphasised that within chaotic systems, demand data, for example, can be forecast reasonably accurately in the\nshort term; this further emphasises the need for effective short-term decision making, rather than long range\nplanning [15].\nConcurrent Engineering and Late Configuration aim to prevent rather than cope with manufacturing\nturbulence. These techniques are effective to some degree in the elimination of turbulence. However, design\nsolutions have their limits, and by dividing the process into a standard and a configuration stage, manufacturing\nturbulence is pushed forward rather than eliminated. As manufacturing companies strive to offer a wider range of\nproduct configurations in order to please each customer individually they will be constantly threatened by\ndesign, volume or mix turbulence. The most usual alternative to cope with manufacturing turbulence is by\nbuilding stocks. Nevertheless, besides being a costly option it can also be extremely risky when applied to mass\ncustomised markets, where most of the products have short life cycles.\nSupply Chain Networks\nManufacturing supply chains in the UK are usually headed by an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) [16],\nwho in the past has dominated the supply chain by utilising the threat posed by multiple sourcing. This power\nculture, though not the practice, is still prevalent in many purchasing departments. Recent business practice has\nbeen for the OEM to divest themselves of parts of the chain that are not \u201cvalue adding\u201d or core activities, and to\nreplace this with partnership relationships with supply networks. Nishiguchi [17] classifies networks in three\nways:\n\uf0b7 Vertical Integration \u2013 where a firm owns most of its supply network. In the automotive industry this may be\napplied to General Motors.\n\uf0b7 Strategic Dualism \u2013 where a firm retains key areas of production but out-sources components. Chrysler\nmay be fit into this category.\n\uf0b7 Clustered Control \u2013 where an assembler deals with a first tier of suppliers who, in turn, manage the second\ntier and so on. BMW may be seen as an example of this category.\nA fourth type of network has emerged which maximises the benefits of close regional contacts and strong ties\nbetween resources. Many writers, for example [18], have pointed out the benefits of having close regional\nnetworks to spur innovation and develop new products. An example is the way the UK motor racing industry\nleads the world, providing a design and development base for all the leading Formula 1 teams and many\nAmerican Indycar teams. It is based on a network of chassis builders and component suppliers mainly located in\nSoutheast England. These regional networks have three key advantages:\n\uf0b7 Network organisations co-located in one region have the potential for more face-to-face interaction,\ntherefore more information is communicated among members.\n\uf0b7 There is a degree of trust between network participants, which is crucial to improving time and quality\nperformance. These networks usually evolve over time.\n\uf0b7 They provide an experience base for other organisations to draw upon, which they are attracted by.\nThe Japanese automotive industry practice of encouraging suppliers to set up nearby (or actually on site!) is\ndesigned to take advantage of these factors. However for smaller OEMs such as Rover, many first tier suppliers\nsuch as TRW may actually be much larger, and getting them to co-locate may be very difficult. They may have\nvery valid concerns about viable order quantity and economies of scale. A recent and increasing trend has been\nfor the supplier to actually provide the labour and systems for installing the supplied part in the OEMs\nmanufacturing process, or to second \u201cguest\u201d engineers to the OEM.\nAgility and the agile supply chain\nAgility is the basis for achieving competitive advantage in changing market conditions. Its origins can be traced\nto an industry-led, federally-funded programme, the Agile Manufacturing Enterprise Forum (operating as the\nAgility Forum) at Lehigh University, Pennsylvania. In 1995, Steven Goldman and his Agility Forum colleagues\ndrew international attention to agility through their book Agile Competitors and Virtual Organisations [19]. This\nbook focused on \"agile product development\" in market conditions of increased complexity and increased\nurgency, and particularly the capabilities required by manufacturers to:\n\uf0b7 Enrich the customer (through a greater variety of value-adding, short-lifetime, bespoke or customised\ngoods and services)\n\uf0b7 Master change (created by changing market conditions, including the actions of competitors, and\ninternally-created by the need to develop a variety of customer-enriching products)\n\uf0b7 Leverage resources (make every part of the organisation contribute to its competitive advantage)\n\uf0b7 Co-operate to compete (access the complementary resources of the supply chain and alliance partners).\nThe authors further propose regarding the supply chain as a customer-supplier relationship:\n\uf0b7 A customer is no longer the recipient in a one-time transaction but a subscriber to the solutions of a\nsupplier.\n\uf0b7 A supplier no longer hands over goods in response to an order but is a long-term supporter or partner of\nthe customer.\n\uf0b7 A sale is no longer a one-time event, but an on-going transfer of products and services, and of payment,\nbetween the supplier and customer.\nThis view is consistent with that of regarding the supply chain as being more than the exchange of data and\ninformation, and requiring higher levels of human knowledge and expertise to colour its operations. Viewing\nagile production as involving (but by no means limited to) the management of supply chain relationships,\nGoldman et al. draw attention to the need for that relationship to be balanced over three dimensions: the\nenrichment of the customer by the supplier; the reward of the supplier by the customer; and the linkage of\nbusiness processes between the two. At the least integrating level of each dimension, a (non-agile) supply chain\nrelationship would involve enrichment through the delivery of simple standardised parts; reward through\npayment of unit price; and linkage through mail, fax and phone. At the most integrated level, an (agile) supply\nchain relationship would involve enrichment by the supplier providing a solution that is easily integrated by the\ncustomer, and which adds value to the customer's customer; reward of the supplier through shared risk and\nrevenue; and business linkage based on highly-integrated business processes using today's telecommunications\ntools. Thus, according to Goldman et al., a fully-agile supply chain is as much to do with business relationships\nand technology as it is to do with production process.\nGoldman et al. set out a strategic blueprint for an agile manufacturing process, while also demonstrating that\nsuch a process could only survive in an enterprise that was itself agile. More recently, Metes et al. [20]\naddressed agility at the whole-enterprise level. Their book Agile Networking identified how business processes\nbuilt upon Internet and intranet networking provided capabilities required by the truly agile enterprise. Among a\nnumber of other networking-based processes that enable agility, these authors refer specifically to change\nproficiency and agile networked alliances.\nIn discussing change proficiency, Metes et al. outline an agile capability most fully developed by Dove (see\n[21]). Change proficiency is an analysis of a producer's proficiency in eight \"Change Proficiency Domains\":\ncreation, capacity, capability, reconfiguration, migration, performance, improvement and recovery. Through this\nanalysis, fully defined by Dove, it is possible for any producer, or, in this instance, a supply chain or member\nwithin it, to optimise its ability to respond to change\nAgile networked alliances are network-enabled relationships between organisations that can be formed and\ndissolved rapidly, but while in operation enable an affiliation between parties that is focused on enriching\ncustomers, mastering change, leveraging (all parties') resources, and thus co-operating to compete for mutual\ncommercial benefit. While not identified as such by Metes at al., an agile networked alliance within a supply\nchain could be viewed as an agile supply chain. Rather than vertical, dualistic, clustered, or regional, as\ndescribed earlier, an agile supply chain would be based on relationships exhibiting a high-level balance of\nenrichment, reward and linkage as defined by Goldman et al. and incorporating knowledge and expertise as\nargued here. It would display high levels of change proficiency as fully explored by Dove [22]. Members would\nalso display Metes et al.'s criteria for membership of an agile networked alliance: the proficiency, culture and the\ntechnology for open, inter-company networking; a mature appreciation of the intellectual assets that can and\ncannot be disclosed; and the ability to operate rapid decision-making and approval processes - including those\nneeded to establish and dissolve the network.\nAt a strategic level, an agile supply chain can be described. However, to describe the strategic model does\nnot help in creating a mechanism that implements it. We believe that virtual teaming, a new working\narrangement that incorporates technology, process, and human factors, offers the means of co-ordinating and\ncontrolling an agile supply chain. Our argument, developed below, is that virtual teaming offers a new model and\ndirection for minimising supply chain turbulence. Its principal virtue is that it permits human collaboration\nregardless of location. This means that the delay and disturbance to communication that is caused by supply\nchain members being geographically separated can be overcome. Indeed, a successful agile supply chain based\non virtual teaming principles would operate more like a continuous collaboration between members, rather than\nepisodic meetings. Such collaboration supplies the strategic oversight and flexibility - based on knowledge and\nexpertise as shown in Figure 2 - necessary to be effective in dealing with the complexity resulting from supply\nchain turbulence. That collaboration also leads to greater responsiveness in solving supply chain problems. It\nprovides the means to operate a regional network, as described by Porter, regardless of the geographical\ndistribution of its members.\nVirtual Teaming\nRecent developments in communication and information technology, coupled with an increased need to co-\nordinate organisational activities across geographically dispersed locations, have led to the development and use\nof virtual teams. The term virtual team, as used in this paper, is defined by Henry & Hartzler [23] as follows:\n\"groups of people who work closely together even though they are geographically separated and may\nreside in different time zones in various parts of the world.\u201d Also as \"cross-functional workgroups brought\ntogether to tackle a project for a finite period of time through a combination of technologies.\" and\n\u201cmembers may occasionally meet face-to-face, but this is clearly the exception due to the physical\nseparation of their \u201chome\u201d location.\u201d\nThe following characteristics clarify the definition of virtual teams\n\uf077 Team members are goal oriented.\n\uf077 Members are dispersed geographically (nationally or internationally)\n\uf077 The team works apart more than in the same location.\n\uf077 The team is a collection of individuals who work together to attain a goal by using\ncomputer-supported networking.\n\uf077 Team members are involved in a co-ordinated undertaking of interrelated activities.\n\uf077 Members are mutually accountable for team results.\n\uf077 Team members solve problems and make decisions jointly.\n\uf077 They are of finite duration, with a beginning and ends (few teams are permanent).\nVirtual teaming eliminates the necessity for physical co-location thus enabling manufacturers to rapidly and\ncontinuously collaborate with suppliers world-wide irrespective of geographical constraints. To achieve high\nlevels of performance, virtual teaming requires the co-ordinated development of people, process and technology,\nas identified by Gundry [24] in Figure 4.\nWe believe that a successful virtual team can be the agent that implements a strategy for reducing turbulence\nin the supply chain. That is, it acts as the mechanism that does the work within an agile supply chain. In that\ncontext, we need to presume that such a team is composed of decision-making members of the companies party\nto a supply chain, who are not necessarily co-located, and have access to virtual teaming technologies (see\nbelow). The team has received training and education to help it overcome the virtual teaming challenges\ndescribed in figure 4, and its members work together apart without the need for face to face meetings\nInsert Figure 4: Factors for Successful Virtual Team Implementation (Source: after Gundry, 1998[ 24])\nThe potential of such a virtual team is considerable. Ideally, and in principle, a virtual team will help reduce\nsupply chain turbulence better than a contractual arrangement or other slow-time, episodic, transactional, often\nconfrontational approach because and if:\n\uf0b7 Members are committed to the agile strategy of mastering change, and the team is built on the certainty\nof change. The team sees mastering turbulence as a collective team problem. Change, variances or other\nexception conditions are not seen as a 'fault' of any one member.\n\uf0b7 Team members discover new, own-team, solutions to change issues that would never have been\ndeveloped in any one of the subscribing companies alone.\n\uf0b7 Rich and sustaining relationships (trust) between team members energise and give priority to devoting\nattention to the team's work and communication, in an attention economy when it's only a part of the\nwork of each member. Trust has to substitute for hierarchical and bureaucratic controls, but virtual\nteams with high trust offer this valuable social asset back to their sponsoring organisations for use in\nfuture opportunities to co-operate.\n\uf0b7 Virtual team facilitation and team-building techniques allow these relationships to be built and\nsustained even though the team meets face to face only infrequently. It allows them to be sustained even\nthough they are subject to erosion from local pressures in the subscribing companies.\n\uf0b7 Team members are however embedded in and close to the operations of their own companies, where\nthe 'source' of turbulence emerges, enabling rapid reporting and notice of change and exceptions, and\nassessment of impacts.\n\uf0b7 Fast-track, synchronous group messaging systems such as audio and video conferencing, and possibly\nshared applications, allow the team to \"meet\" at very short notice to handle emerging exceptions and\nproblems. Delay is deadly to mastering supply chain turbulence.\n\uf0b7 In parallel, sustained, group asychnronous messaging systems such as computer conferencing form the\nbackbone of the team's continuous and, importantly, all-informed communication - sharing issues,\nannouncing upcoming problems, changes, etc., allowing unforeseen impacts to be recognised, and\nmaintaining context and relationships.\nVirtual teams, as identified above, require modern networking technologies in order to achieve high levels of\nmutual affinity and fast decision-making amongst their members. Figure 5 (adapted from [25]) identifies some of\nthe tools commonly utilised for co-ordinating collaborative work.\nInsert Figure 5: Collaboration Technologies\nAdapted from Szewczak and Khosrowpour, [25, p193]\nVirtual teaming is, however, far more than the mere application of technology. It requires the simultaneous and\nsynergistic attention to process and teaming factors, as shown in Figure 4. However, it is generally common for\norganisations to concentrate on the technology aspect to the exclusion of 'softer' factors. Clegg et al. [26]\nconduced extensive research that concluded that organisations are typically not successful in attending to the\nnon-technical aspects of IT projects. In particular, the majority of companies fail to consider how work should\nbe organised and jobs designed to make the new technologies effective.\nHaving identified above what in principle an ideal virtual team could contribute to an agile supply chain, we\nnow present evidence from two sources. The first is of virtual teamworking by automotive suppliers in the UK\nand the second from a survey of automotive suppliers regarding current working practices and the perceived\nbenefits and drawbacks of virtual teaming in the supply chain.\nThe TEAM project\nThe Team-based European Automotive Manufacture [27] multimedia and communications project (ACTS\nAC070) demonstrated the benefits that can be achieved by using appropriate information systems to support\ncollaborative working between geographically distributed project teams. The findings are based on an analysis of\ntwo Virtual Teams comprising design, logistics and quality engineers plus business managers from key suppliers\nover many meetings tackling problems that would normally require face to face meetings, or problems which\nnormally one of the parties would attempt to resolve themselves. They used a Computer-Supported\nCollaborative Working system (CSCW) that provided facilities for audio and video links, a shared whiteboard,\nsharing of documents, real time sharing of CAD applications and a Web-based product library with controlled\naccess. Interviews with key participants and with members of the organisational hierarchy were conducted so\nthat the critical success factors related to the introduction of such technology could be derived. The benefits of\neffective Virtual Teams were found to include:\n\uf0b7 Reduction in non-value-adding activities such as travel and delays imposed by mail;\n\uf0b7 The ability to react quickly and flexibly to problems;\n\uf0b7 A more accurate understanding of the design issues due to the interactive nature of the discussions;\n\uf0b7 Potential time-savings of up to 50% for some stages of the Product Introduction Process.\nCollaborative working among Rover Suppliers\nA mail survey of the automotive suppliers was conducted in the summer of 1998 [28] to identify current working\npractises and attitudes to virtual teaming. Three hundred questionaires were sent to suppliers of components,\nsub-systems, systems and services to Rover Group. Replies from seventy companies were received within the\ndesired timeframe. The majority of these companies employed less than 1000 people at the relevant site, 76%\nparticipated in engineering design with Rover, and 72% utilised collaborative team working, defined as cross-\nfunctional and organisational workgroups brought together to tackle a project for a finite period.\nIn the six month period to June 1998, each company had on average 36.16 meetings and on average there\nwere 3.33 people from Rover and 2.7 people from the supplier at each meeting. Figure 6 identifies the tools used\nto enable collaborative work, and the frequency of use in that 6 month period.\nInsert Figure 6: Methods of Communication used with Rover and how often\nClearly communication is mainly via face-to-face meetings. Figure 7 highlights that communication difficulty\ncauses the most significant problems in collaborative teaming.\nInsert Figure 7: Difficulties faced in using teamworking\nMore detailed results of the survey were these:\n\uf0b7 The companies indicated a strong desire (81%) to use virtual teaming utilising tools like video conferencing\nto support their collaboration.\n\uf0b7 The most important benefits from using virtual teaming identified ( % of respondents) were:\n- Time savings (25%) \u2013 time saved waiting for meetings, time wasted in travelling.\n- Cost saving (23%)\n- Ability to quickly pull in extra expertise into a meeting (20%)\n- Reduction in wasted time (17%). This is viewed as time saved due to reduced uncertainty and\nconfusion as a result of the ability to schedule shorter meetings more frequesntly\n\uf0b7 The issues that worried the companies most about adopting virtual teaming tools were:\n- Lack of physical presence \/ loss in richness of interaction (35%)\n- Loss of social contact (26%)\n- Requirement for IT expertise (16%)\n- Security of information (12%)\n- Availability of in-house data in right format (11%)\nFrom the data presented we see that virtual teaming is becoming accepted in principle within automotive\nsupply chain relationships. Eight out of ten companies in the Rover supply chain wished to use a virtual teaming\ntechnology, and typically cited \"better, faster cheaper\" advantages. Issues and barriers, however, remain: the\nmost prominent being to do with the \"teaming\" aspects of virtual teaming as shown in Figure 4. It is likely that\nthe members of the Rover supply chains saw only the application of a technology, not a capability for allowing a\nteam, with a common purpose to apply broader expertise and knowledge, to operate regardless of distance.\nConclusion\nThe design, manufacture and delivery of a product requires ever-higher levels of knowledge and expertise within\nthe supply chain - above and beyond the exchange of information and data - if turbulence in tiered supply chains\nis to be fully overcome. The agility philosophy goes so far as proposing that successful, agile, supply chains are\nbuilt on rich relationships amongst all parties: certainly embodying knowledge and expertise. Virtual teaming is\nthe most appropriate framework and mechanism in which to examine how such rich relationships - and the\nexchange of knowledge and expertise - can be created across a distributed supply chain. In principle, virtual\nteaming could allow joint commitment, feelings of mutuality, trust and creativity, and rapid decision-making to\noperate within a supply chain, regardless of the geographical location of its members. For this to be possible,\nhowever, a virtual team needs to be built by concentrating on process, teaming and technology factors. However\nexperience from other IT-based initiatives is that technology will be concentrated on to the exclusion of other\nfactors. Data from the two sources shown here supports this contention. The TEAM and survey data show\nrecognition of the value of virtual teaming within the supply chain. However, the TEAM experience shows that\nnot all problems have been overcome, the remaining problems are in the process and teaming areas. However, if\nimplemented correctly, virtual teaming could be a significant innovation in effective management of an agile\nsupply chain.\nAcknowledgement\nThis work was supported in part by the UK Economic and Social Research Council Innovations Programme\nproject grant L1251033 to C.
