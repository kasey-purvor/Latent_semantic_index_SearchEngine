Expression\nfrom this promoter is dependent on direct activation\nby the cyclic AMP receptor protein, which binds to a\ntarget centred 49.5 base pairs upstream from the tran-\nscript start. Activator-dependent transcription from\nthe aer promoter was reconstituted in vitro, and a\ntethered inorganic nuclease was used to find the posi-\ntion of the C-terminal domains of the RNA polymerase\na subunits in transcriptionally competent open com-\nplexes. We report that the ternary activator\u2013RNA\npolymerase\u2013aer promoter open complex is organized\ndifferently from complexes at previously character-\nized promoters. Among other E. coli promoters recog-\nnized by RNA polymerase containing s28, only the trg\npromoter is activated directly by the cyclic AMP recep-\ntor protein. The organization of the different promoter\nelements and the activator binding site at the trg pro-\nmoter is the same as at the aer promoter, suggesting a\ncommon activation mechanism.\nIntroduction\nThe cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP, also known as the\ncatabolite activator protein, CAP) is a global transcription\nfactor, which plays a central role in the control of metabo-\nlism in Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria (Kolb\net al., 1993; Barrett et al., 2005). CRP, which is functional\nas a homodimer, recognizes 22 bp target sequences, with\nthe consensus 5\u2032-AAATGTGATCTAGATCACATTT-3\u2032. At\nmost target promoters studied to date, CRP activates\ntranscription by making one or more direct contacts with\nRNA polymerase, and there appear to be two major\nclasses of simple CRP-activated promoters (Busby and\nEbright, 1999). At Class I promoters, CRP binds upstream\nof the promoter -35 element, at a site centred at position\n-61.5 (i.e. between base pairs 61 and 62 upstream from\nthe transcript start), or further upstream, and an activating\nregion (AR1) in the downstream subunit of the CRP dimer\nmakes contact with the C-terminal domain of one of the\ntwo RNA polymerase a subunits (aCTD). At Class II pro-\nmoters, CRP binds at a target that overlaps the promoter\n-35 element and is usually centred at position -41.5. AR1\nin the upstream subunit of the CRP dimer interacts with\naCTD, while a second activating region (AR2) in the\ndownstream subunit interacts with the N-terminal domain\nof one of the two RNA polymerase a subunits (aNTD)\n(Busby and Ebright, 1999).\nAlthough the mechanisms of activation by CRP at both\nclasses of promoter have been scrutinized in detail, most\nstudies have focused on a small number of natural and\nsynthetic model promoters, so it is unclear whether\nthe findings apply to all target promoters. Genomic\napproaches have now identified scores of new targets for\nCRP (Tan et al., 2001; Brown and Callan, 2004; Gosset\net al., 2004; Zheng et al., 2004; Grainger et al., 2005).\nThis affords an opportunity to study CRP-dependent regu-\nlation at a range of naturally occurring promoters, and to\nuncover novel mechanisms of regulation by CRP. Previ-\nously, Hollands et al. (2007) investigated the action of\nCRP at 11 such uncharacterized targets in the E. coli K-12\ngenome. One of these was located in the regulatory\nregion of the aer gene, which encodes an aerotaxis\nsensor protein that controls movement of bacterial cells in\nresponse to the availability of oxygen and other electron\nacceptors in the environment (Bibikov et al., 1997; Reb-\nbapragada et al., 1997; Taylor et al., 1999). CRP binding\nupstream of aer was first detected by Grainger et al.\n(2005) in a whole genome chromatin immunoprecipitation\nanalysis, and it was subsequently shown that CRP acti-\nvates transcription by binding to a single DNA site in the\naer regulatory region (Hollands et al., 2007).\nRecent transcriptome analyses have indicated that\nexpression of aer in both E. coli and Salmonella enterica\nAccepted 30 September, 2009. *For correspondence.

Recall that the RNA\npolymerase s subunit is a dissociable promoter specificity\nfactor that binds to core RNA polymerase (E) to form the\nRNA polymerase holoenzyme (Es), which can recognize\npromoter sequences and initiate transcription (Burgess\net al., 1969). Most bacteria contain multiple s factors that\nrecognize different promoter -10 and -35 elements. A\nprimary s factor (s70 in E. coli ) drives the transcription of\ngenes with \u2018housekeeping\u2019 functions, while a number of\nalternative s factors direct transcription of particular sets\nof genes in response to environmental signals or\nstresses, or function to control development (Ishihama,\n2000; Gruber and Gross, 2003). s28, which is encoded by\nthe fliA gene, is the most widely distributed alternative s\nfactor (Koo et al., 2009; Smith and Hoover, 2009), and\ncontrols the transcription of operons required for flagellar\nfilament assembly and for the regulation of motility and\nchemotaxis in a large number of Gram-positive and Gram-\nnegative bacteria (Chilcott and Hughes, 2000).\nMost studies on transcription activation by CRP have\nbeen concerned with promoters recognized by RNA\nholoenzyme containing s70 (Es70). Here, we report the first\ninvestigation into the direct regulation by CRP of transcrip-\ntion by RNA polymerase containing s28 (Es28). We show\nthat aer is transcribed from a single s28-dependent pro-\nmoter that is activated by CRP binding at a location dif-\nferent from any previously characterized CRP-activated\npromoter. We also show that CRP directly activates tran-\nscription from a second s28-dependent promoter that has\na similar organization.\nResults and discussion\nTranscription from the aer regulatory region requires\nboth CRP and s28 in vivo\nTo study the effects of CRP and s28 on expression of aer,\nwe cloned a DNA fragment covering the aer gene regula-\ntory region (aer200; Hollands et al., 2007) into a low-copy-\nnumber lac expression vector, pRW50, and we measured\nthe activity of the resulting aer200::lacZ fusion in E. coli\nK-12 Dlac strain M182 and derivatives containing deletions\nof either the crp or fliA gene. Results presented in Fig. 1A\n(black lines) show that, in M182, there is a large increase in\npromoter activity during late exponential phase that\ndecreases on entry into stationary phase. This is consistent\nwith the findings of Barembruch and Hengge (2007), who\nobserved a similar pattern of expression for the s28-\ndependent flgM promoter, and correlates with an accumu-\nlation of s28 protein during late exponential phase followed\nby a decline in s28 levels once the culture enters stationary\nphase (K. Hollands, unpubl. data; Barembruch and\nHengge, 2007). In the DfliA and Dcrp backgrounds\n(Fig. 1A, red and grey lines), promoter activity remained at\na basal level throughout the growth cycle. This confirms\nthat both CRP and s28 are essential for expression from the\naer regulatory region in vivo. However, this experiment is\ncomplicated by the fact thats28 expression is dependent on\nCRP. This is because CRP is required to activate transcrip-\ntion of the flhDC operon that encodes an essential activator\nof transcription from the fliA promoter (Soutourina et al.,\n1999). Indeed, Western blot analysis confirms that no s28\nprotein is present in strain M182 Dcrp (Fig. S1, lanes 1\u20133).\nTo investigate the action of CRP at the aer regulatory\nregion, independent of the indirect effect of CRP on s28\nlevels, we established an experimental system in which\nexpression of s28 is uncoupled from CRP. To do this, we\nused DfliA derivatives of M182 and M182 Dcrp that had\nFig. 1. CRP and s28 dependency of aer promoter activity\nthroughout growth.\nA.

We measured expression of the aer200::lacZ fusion\nin pRW50 in these strains. Data illustrated in Fig. 1B show\nthat, in M182 DfliA pKXH100, the activity of the\naer200::lacZ fusion follows a similar pattern to that in\nstrain M182 (which expresses fliA from the chromosome),\nexcept that the increase in promoter activity occurs later in\ngrowth, once the culture begins to enter stationary phase.\nThis correlates with a delayed increase in s28 protein\nlevels in this background (K. Hollands, unpubl. results). In\nthe absence of CRP, promoter activity remains low\nthroughout the growth cycle, showing that the require-\nment for CRP for expression from the aer regulatory\nregion is independent of the effect of CRP on s28 levels.\nWe conclude that CRP must function directly at the aer\nregulatory region, and this is consistent with the previous\nobservation that introducing mutations into the DNA target\nfor CRP upstream of aer prevents CRP-dependent acti-\nvation of the aer200::lacZ fusion (Hollands et al., 2007).\naer is transcribed from a single s28-dependent\npromoter in vivo\nAlthough the aer regulatory region has been predicted as\na target for Es28 (Park et al., 2001; Frye et al., 2006; Zhao\net al., 2007), the promoter determinants required for tran-\nscription initiation have not been identified experimentally.\nTo define the DNA elements required for s28-dependent\ntranscription of aer, we began by mapping the aer tran-\nscript start site by primer extension analysis, using the\naer200 promoter fragment cloned in pRW50. This yielded\na single extension product approximately 148 nucleotides\nin length (Fig. 2A), which places the transcript start point\nat the position labelled +1 in Fig. 2B. This falls 6 bp down-\nstream from the -10 octamer element for a s28-dependent\npromoter predicted by Park et al. (2001). To examine the\nimportance of this promoter, we constructed derivatives of\nthe aer200 fragment containing point mutations in the\nputative -10 and -35 elements (Table 1 and Fig. 2B). In\nthe -10 element, we targeted the highly conserved\n5\u2032-CGA-3\u2032 motif, from positions -11 to -9, because muta-\ntions in this motif result in a loss of s28-dependent tran-\nscription from other s28-dependent promoters, both in vivo\nand in vitro (Yu et al., 2006; Wozniak and Hughes, 2008).\nIn the -35 octamer, we targeted positions -32T and -30A,\nwhich are also highly conserved and are important for\ns28-dependent transcription from the Salmonella flgM pro-\nmoter, and position -28, which has more minor effects on\nflgM promoter activity (Wozniak and Hughes, 2008). Each\nmutant promoter fragment was cloned into pRW50, and\nexpression of the resulting promoter::lacZ fusions was\nmeasured in the CRP+ FliA+, CRP\u2013 FliA+ and CRP+ FliA\u2013\nbackgrounds. Results listed in Table 1 show that the sub-\nFig. 2. Identification of the aer transcript start site.\nA. The figure shows the result of primer extension analysis using RNA extracted from strain M182, carrying the aer200 fragment cloned in\npRW50, grown aerobically to mid-exponential phase (OD650 0.4\u20130.6) in LB medium. Control primer extension reactions were also carried out\nusing RNA extracted from M182 cells containing \u2018empty\u2019 pRW50, or pRW50 carrying the CC(-41.5) promoter, whose transcript start site is\nknown, and which gives a primer extension product of 118 nt in pRW50. The sizes of primer extension products were determined by\ncalibration against sequencing reactions (lanes G and A).\nB.

The transcript start site\nproposed here is boxed, and the aer translation start codon is underlined. The proposed -10 and -35 octamer elements of the s28-dependent\naer promoter, and the DNA site for CRP, are highlighted in bold. The consensus sequence for each DNA element is indicated in grey below\nthe sequence (Busby and Ebright, 1999; Koo et al., 2009). Bases in the -10 and -35 elements that were targeted for mutational analysis are\nunderlined in bold. The EcoRI and HindIII sites flanking the aer200 fragment are shown in italics, and the sequence is numbered with the aer\ntranscript start site as +1.\n1100 K. Hollands, D. J. Lee, G. S. Lloyd and S. J. W. Busby \u0002\n\u00a9 2009 The Authors\nJournal compilation \u00a9 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Molecular Microbiology, 75, 1098\u20131111\nstitutions in the -10 element had the greatest effect on\npromoter activity, reducing expression from the aer regu-\nlatory region to the level observed in the absence of\ns28. Mutations at positions -32, -30 and -28 in the -35\nelement also severely reduced promoter activity. We con-\nclude that the proposed -10 and -35 elements are essen-\ntial for s28-dependent transcription of aer, and, together\nwith the transcript start site data, this argues that aer is\nexpressed from a single promoter, at least under the\nconditions tested here.\nTranscription initiation at the aer promoter in vitro\nNext, we sought to confirm our in vivo findings by exam-\nining the s factor selectivity and CRP dependence of the\naer promoter in vitro. We began by cloning the aer200\nfragment upstream of the loop terminator in plasmid pSR,\nand tested the ability of purified Es28 and Es70 to drive\ntranscription from the aer promoter in an in vitro multi-\nround transcription assay, in the presence and absence of\npurified CRP and cAMP (Fig. 3A). In this system, tran-\nscription initiating at the aer promoter terminates at the\nloop terminator to generate a 158-base transcript that\ncan be identified by electrophoresis. In the presence of\nEs28, a single transcript was observed (Fig. 3A, lanes\n3\u201312). At low Es28 concentrations, this transcript is\ndetected only in the presence of CRP (lanes 3\u20136),\nalthough some transcript is generated in the absence of\nCRP as the RNA polymerase concentration is increased\n(lanes 7\u201312). At even higher concentrations of Es28, tran-\nscription becomes completely independent of CRP (data\nnot shown). The aer transcript generated by Es28 is not\ndetected in reactions using Es70 (Fig. 3A, lanes 13 and\n14). Instead, a single CRP-independent transcript is pro-\nduced, which corresponds to the 108-base RNAI control\ntranscript that originates from the pSR replication origin.\nTo confirm that in vitro transcription initiates from the\nsame promoter defined in our in vivo experiments, pro-\nmoter unwinding by RNA polymerase was monitored by\nusing KMnO4 to probe for single-stranded regions of DNA\n(Fig. 3B). In the presence of Es28 (lanes 3 and 4), KMnO4-\nreactive bands appeared from positions -10 to +4, indica-\ntive of promoter melting around the -10 element of the\ns28-dependent promoter highlighted in Fig. 2B. This was\nobserved both in the presence and in the absence of CRP,\nwhich is consistent with our finding that transcription ini-\ntiation by Es28 is independent of CRP in vitro at the high\nRNA polymerase concentrations used in these reactions.\nIncubation with Es70 did not result in promoter melting\naround the aer transcript start site, either in the presence\nor in the absence of CRP (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6). Taken\ntogether, the in vitro data confirm that aer is transcribed\nfrom a single, s28-dependent promoter that is activated by\nCRP when the RNA polymerase concentration is limited.\nThe observation that the aer promoter becomes less\ndependent on CRP at higher RNA polymerase concentra-\ntions suggests that CRP activates transcription by recruit-\nment of RNA polymerase (Rhodius et al., 1997).\nTranscription activation at the aer promoter requires\nCRP binding at an atypical location\nMutational analysis showed that CRP-dependent activa-\ntion of the aer200::lacZ fusion requires CRP binding to\nthe single DNA target indicated in Fig. 2B (Hollands\net al., 2007). This target site is centred 49.5 bp upstream\nfrom the transcript start site, which falls between the\ntypical Class I location of position -61.5 and the Class II\nlocation of position -41.5. To investigate whether CRP\ncan activate s28-dependent transcription from positions\n-41.5 or -61.5 at the aer promoter, we constructed a\ndeletion or insertion in the aer200 fragment to make the\nTable 1.

This indicates that CRP cannot activate transcrip-\ntion from the aer promoter when bound at a Class II\nlocation. Moving the CRP site to position -61.5 (aer211)\nresults in a twofold decrease in promoter activity, but,\nwhile the residual promoter activity is dependent on\nCRP, it is independent of s28. The most likely explanation\nfor this is that, here, CRP is activating transcription from\nan alternative cryptic s28-independent promoter. For\nexample, in the aer211 fragment, a 6 bp sequence,\n5\u2032-TAAAGA-3\u2032, is located 32 bp downstream of the DNA\nsite for CRP and this may well generate a weak Class II\nCRP-dependent promoter served by Es70 (recall that the\nconsensus -10 hexamer for Es70 is 5\u2032-TATAAT-3\u2032).\nNext, we used the same system to monitor the effects of\nmaking a 5 bp deletion or insertion between the DNA site\nfor CRP and the -35 element at the aer promoter. Both the\ndeletion, which moved the DNA site for CRP to position\n-44.5 (aer226), and the insertion, which moved the DNA\nsite for CRP to position -54.5 (aer227), resulted in a\nreduction in promoter activity in the CRP+ FliA+ strain to the\nbasal level observed in the absence of CRP (Fig. 4, lower\ntwo panels). This indicates that CRP is unable to activate\ntranscription from the aer promoter when its DNA site is\nmoved to the opposite face of the DNA helix. These experi-\nments argue that optimal activation of s28-dependent tran-\nscription requires CRP binding at position -49.5.\nLocation of RNA polymerase a C-terminal domains at\nthe aer promoter\nActivation by CRP at both Class I and Class II s70-\ndependent promoters requires a contact between CRP\nactivating region 1 (AR1) and aCTD. Previous work\nshowed that CRP-dependent activation at the aer pro-\nmoter also requires AR1 (Hollands et al., 2007), which\nlikely functions by contacting aCTD in Es28. Because the\norganization of the aer promoter is unlike that at Class I or\nClass II CRP-dependent promoters, it is unclear whether\nthe interaction between AR1 and aCTD occurs via the\nupstream or downstream subunit of dimeric CRP bound at\nthe promoter. To address this, we mapped the location of\naCTD binding at the aer promoter using purified RNA\npolymerase that had been labelled with the chemical\nnuclease reagent iron [S]-1-[p-bromoacetamidobenzyl]\nethylenediaminetetraacetate (FeBABE) on a single cys-\nteine residue at position 302 in the aCTDs (see Experi-\nmental procedures). Transcriptionally competent open\ncomplexes were formed using the end-labelled aer200\npromoter fragment, purified CRP and FeBABE-tagged\nEs28, and DNA cleavage by FeBABE was triggered.\nAnalysis of the pattern of DNA cleavage by gel electro-\nphoresis reveals the location of the aCTDs at the aer\npromoter. Note that, in this assay, in most cases, a single\nFe-BABE-labelled aCTD will give rise to cleavages in two\nadjacent minor grooves, as a wave of hydroxyl radicals\ngenerated from the Fe-BABE impinges on the target DNA\n(Lee et al., 2003).\nResults presented in Fig. 5A show that, in the presence\nof CRP and Es28 (lane 3), DNA cleavage on the template\nstrand of the aer promoter is enhanced around positions\n-72 and -64 upstream of the DNA site for CRP, and around\npositions -38 and -30 downstream of the CRP site. This\nindicates that the aCTDs can contact the DNA both\nupstream and downstream of the bound CRP dimer. In the\npresence of Es28, but in the absence of CRP (lane 2), the\npattern of DNA cleavage is similar to the background\ndetected in the absence of any protein (lane 1). This\nsuggests that the twoaCTDs are positioned at their targets\non the DNA only in the presence of CRP. Interestingly, the\nspacing between the centre of the DNA site for CRP and\nthe downstream FeBABE-induced DNA cleavage at the\naer promoter is identical to that observed by Lee et al.\n(2003) at a Class I CRP-dependent promoter served by\nEs70 (Fig. 5B and C). Similarly, the spacing between the\ncentre of the DNA site for CRP and the upstream FeBABE-\ninduced DNA cleavage is identical to that seen at a Class II\nCRP-dependent promoter served by Es70 (Lee et al.,\n2003). Thus, the juxtaposition between the downstream-\nbound aCTD and CRP in open complexes at the aer\npromoter appears to be identical to the AR1-mediated\njuxtaposition between downstream-bound aCTD and CRP\nat a Class I CRP-dependent promoter. Similarly, the juxta-\nposition between the upstream-bound aCTD and CRP at\nthe aer promoter appears to be identical to the AR1-\nmediated juxtaposition between upstream-bound aCTD\nand CRP at a Class II CRP-dependent promoter (Fig. 5B\nand C).\nIn the crystal structure of the CRP-aCTD-DNA complex,\naCTD contacts approximately 6 bp of DNA spanning a\nminor groove, centred 18\u201319 bp from the centre of the\nDNA site for CRP (Benoff et al., 2002). The locations of\nthe specific DNA cleavages at the aer promoter are con-\nsistent with binding of the aCTDs at sites centred 18.5 bp\nboth upstream and downstream of the DNA site for CRP\n(Fig. 5B). These sequences are also AT-rich, a feature\nassociated with DNA binding by aCTD (Gourse et al.,\n2000).\nRegulation by CRP at another s28-dependent promoter\nTo investigate whether CRP directly regulates Es28-\ndependent transcription at other promoters, we used elec-\ntromobility shift assays to compare the binding of CRP to\nend-labelled DNA fragments covering the regulatory\nregions of aer and the seven other s28-dependent operons\nfrom E. coli K-12 strain MG1655 described by Zhao et al.\n(2007). The results, illustrated in Fig. 6, show that CRP\nbinds to a single site in the aer200 fragment, but binding\nActivation of s28-dependent transcription by CRP 1103\n\u00a9 2009 The Authors\nJournal compilation \u00a9 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Molecular Microbiology, 75, 1098\u20131111\nof CRP to specific targets in the tsr and trg regulatory\nregions was also detected. Note that bioinformatic analy-\nses had predicted DNA sites for CRP upstream of both tsr\nand trg (Robison et al., 1998). The trg promoter fragment\nbinds CRP with similar affinity to the aer fragment, while\nCRP binding to the tsr fragment is much tighter. No clear\nbinding of CRP was found with the fliC\/fliD, flgMN, flgKL,\nmotAB\/cheAW or tar\/tap\/cheRBYZ fragments.\nThe action of CRP at the tsr and trg regulatory regions\nwas studied further. In the tsr regulatory region, the pre-\ndicted CRP site is located 132.5 bp upstream of the s28-\ndependent tsr promoter, so it is unlikely that CRP makes\ndirect contact with bound Es28. Indeed, no direct effect of\nCRP on gene expression from the tsr regulatory region\ncould be detected (K. Hollands, unpubl. data). In contrast,\nalignment of the DNA sequences of the trg and aer regu-\nFig. 5. Mapping the location of the RNA polymerase a C-terminal domains at the aer promoter.\nA.

Hollands, D. J. Lee, G. S. Lloyd and S. J. W. Busby \u0002\n\u00a9 2009 The Authors\nJournal compilation \u00a9 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Molecular Microbiology, 75, 1098\u20131111\nlatory regions revealed that the spacing between the pre-\ndicted DNA sites for CRP and the different elements of the\ntwo s28-dependent promoters is identical (Fig. 7A).\nTo measure the effect of CRP on expression from the\ntrg regulatory region, the trg100 promoter fragment was\ncloned into pRW50, and the activity of each promoter\n::lacZ fusion was measured in the CRP+ FliA+, CRP\u2013 FliA+\nand CRP+ FliA\u2013 backgrounds. Recall that, in the condi-\ntions used in our experiments, direct effects of CRP on\ntranscription of promoter::lacZ fusions in pRW50 can be\nmeasured independent of the effect of CRP on s28 levels.\nResults illustrated in Fig. 7B indicate that expression from\nthe trg regulatory region, like the aer promoter, is depen-\ndent on s28 and is activated by CRP. The conservation of\nthe spacing between the DNA site for CRP and the -10\nand -35 elements at the aer and trg promoters suggests\nthat the mechanisms of transcription activation at the two\npromoters are similar. Interestingly, the trg and aer genes\nencode homologous proteins with similar functions. While\nAer is an energy sensor that controls responses to redox\nsignals, Trg is a chemosensor that responds to the\nmonosaccharides ribose and galactose (Taylor et al.,\n1999).\nConclusions\nHere we have described the first examples of direct acti-\nvation by CRP of promoters served by RNA polymerase\nholoenzyme containing the flagellar sigma factor, s28. We\nshowed that transcription of the E. coli K-12 aer gene is\ndriven by a single s28-dependent promoter, which is acti-\nvated by CRP binding to a single site positioned 49.5 base\npairs upstream of the transcript start site. This location\nappears optimal for activation. This is in contrast to the\nsituation at previously studied Class I and Class II CRP-\ndependent promoters where the optimal locations for acti-\nvation by CRP are positions -61.5 and -41.5 respectively,\nand where CRP activates only very weakly when bound to\na site centred near position -50 (Gaston et al., 1990). Our\nresults argue that the spacing requirements for CRP-\ndependent activation at promoters served by Es28 differ\nfrom those at promoters served by Es70. It is possible that\npromoters recognized by some other alternative s factors\nalso require CRP binding at unusual locations. For\nexample, at the s38-dependent csiD promoter, CRP acti-\nvates optimally from a DNA site centred at position -68.5\n(Germer et al., 2001). From this position, or a site located\nFig. 6.

Our results\nshow that the two aCTDs of Es28 contact DNA both\nupstream and downstream of CRP, although note that we\ncannot prove that both contacts occur simultaneously.\nThe finding that one aCTD binds downstream of CRP at\nthe aer promoter was surprising. Structural modelling of\nthe CRP-RNA polymerase-DNA complex at a Class I pro-\nmoter, where the DNA site for CRP is centred at position\n-61.5, indicates that one aCTD is tightly sandwiched\nbetween CRP and s70, such that it can simultaneously\ncontact DNA, AR1 on CRP and s70 domain 4 (Chen et al.,\n2003; Lawson et al., 2004). As the DNA site for CRP at the\naer promoter is located 12 bp downstream, it appears that\nthere cannot be sufficient space for aCTD to fit between\nthe CRP dimer and the promoter-bound sigma factor. We\nmodelled the structure of the CRP-RNA polymerase-DNA\ncomplex at the aer promoter by combining the crystal\nstructure of the CRP-aCTD-DNA complex (Benoff et al.,\n2002) with the EsA.-fork junction DNA structure (Murakami\net al., 2002) and, as expected, we found that there is a\nclash between the predicted locations of the aCTD down-\nstream of CRP and domain 4 of s, which contacts\nthe promoter -35 element (K. Hollands and D.J. Lee,\nunpublished). This leads us to propose a model in which\nthe organization of the CRP-Es28-DNA complex at the aer\npromoter differs from that of the CRP-Es70-DNA complex\nat a Class I s70-dependent promoter (Fig. 8A). Our\nFeBABE footprinting data indicate that the juxtaposition of\nCRP and the downstream aCTD at the aer promoter is the\nsame as at the Class I promoter. This implies that it must\nbe domain 4 of s28 that is positioned differently within the\nCRP-Es28-DNA complex, compared with domain 4 of s70\nwithin the CRP-Es70-DNA complex at a Class I promoter.\nThis is supported by the observation that the -10 and -35\nelements at s28-dependent promoters are located 2\u20133 bp\ncloser together than at promoters served by Es70\n(Fig. 8B), suggesting that the contact site for s28 domain 4\non promoter DNA may lie several bases downstream of\nthat for s70 domain 4 at a s70-dependent promoter. The\nFig. 7. Activation of the s28-dependent trg promoter by CRP.\nA. Sequence alignment of the aer and trg regulatory regions.

Data shown are averages from three independent experiments, and error bars indicate one standard deviation.\n1106 K. Hollands, D. J. Lee, G. S. Lloyd and S. J. W. Busby \u0002\n\u00a9 2009 The Authors\nJournal compilation \u00a9 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Molecular Microbiology, 75, 1098\u20131111\nmodel, illustrated in Fig. 8A, suggests that domain 4 of s28\nis offset by rotation and translocation around the surface\nof the promoter DNA. It is quite possible that this is its\n\u2018normal\u2019 position at s28-dependent promoters, but this will\nrequire further experimental evidence.\nAlthough E. coli contains hundreds of transcription acti-\nvators, there are few examples of factor-dependent acti-\nvation of promoters recognized by alternative s factors\nsuch as s28. Transcription from promoters served by alter-\nnative s factors is mostly regulated by controlling the\nexpression and activity of the s factor itself, and by the\nvery stringent promoter recognition properties of the alter-\nnative s factors. It is generally accepted that control over\nmost flagellar genes is exerted by regulating the expres-\nsion and activity of FlhDC, s28, and the anti-s factor, FlgM\n(Chilcott and Hughes, 2000; Keseler et al., 2009). Our\nfindings show that transcription activators can also play\nan important role in controlling transcription by Es28.\nThe similar organization of the aer and trg promoters\nsuggests a common mechanism of direct activation by\nCRP. However, we found no evidence for direct regulation\nby CRP at the six other well-characterized s28-dependent\npromoters in E. coli K-12. This raises the question of why\nCRP should directly regulate transcription of aer and trg,\nparticularly when CRP indirectly regulates transcription of\nall genes in the flagellar cascade by controlling expres-\nsion of the master regulator, FlhDC. Expression of FlhDC\nis tightly regulated by multiple transcription factors, includ-\ning CRP, H-NS and OmpR, and hence the genes of the\nflagellar cascade are regulated in response to many dif-\nferent environmental inputs (Shin and Park, 1995; Sout-\nourina et al., 1999). It is possible that expression of aer\nand trg is required only in response to conditions that\ninduce CRP activity and not in response to other signals\nthat induce the flagellar cascade. Alternatively, expression\nof aer and trg may need to be upregulated to a greater\nextent than other genes when CRP activity is induced.\nThis may be particularly important when levels of Es28 are\nlow. In these conditions, recruitment of Es28 by CRP may\nensure that the aer and trg transcription units are prefer-\nentially expressed compared with other s28-dependent\ngenes. Note that aer and trg encode homologous methyl-\naccepting chemotaxis regulator-type proteins, which inter-\nact with the flagellar motor via the CheA\/CheY signalling\npathway to control the direction of bacterial movement in\nresponse to different chemical or energetic signals (Taylor\net al., 1999). The direct involvement of CRP in their regu-\nlation may therefore simply be a reflection of the role of\nCRP in facilitating the acquisition and metabolism of nutri-\nents other than glucose (Kolb et al., 1993).\nExperimental procedures\nStrains, plasmids and promoter constructs\nThe E. coli K-12 strains, plasmids and promoter fragments\nused in this study are listed in Table 2. Standard recombinant\nDNA techniques were used throughout and all the oligonucle-\notide primers used are listed in Table S1.\nThe DfliA derivatives of strains M182 and M182 Dcrp were\nconstructed by P1 transduction of a fliA::kan mutation from\nstrain JW1907-1. The kanamycin resistance marker was sub-\nsequently removed by expressing the FLP recombinase from\nplasmid pCP20, as described by Cherepanov and Wacker-\nnagel (1995), and the presence of the deletion was confirmed\nby colony PCR using primers D56550 and D56551.\nPlasmid pKXH100 was constructed by cloning an NdeI-\nXhoI fragment carrying the fliA coding sequence from E. coli\nK-12 strain MG1655, amplified by PCR using primers\nD57845 and D57846, into plasmid pET21a (Novagen). As a\nresult of leaky expression, genes cloned under the control of\nthe T7 promoter in pET21a are expressed even in strains that\ndo not produce T7 RNA polymerase, including M182 (Wu\net al., 2005). This activity is independent of the presence of\nthe inducer IPTG (K. Hollands, unpubl. results).\nFig. 8. Organization of the CRP-RNA polymerase-DNA complex\nat the aer promoter.\nA.

Promoter fragments were amplified by PCR from\ngenomic DNA of E. coli K-12 strain MG1655, using primers\nthat introduce flanking EcoRI and HindIII sites (listed in\nTable S1). For promoter activity assays, EcoRI-HindIII frag-\nments were cloned into the lac expression vector, pRW50. To\nconstruct templates for in vitro transcription assays, and to\ngenerate DNA fragments for electromobility shift assays and\nfootprinting, promoter fragments were cloned into plasmid\npSR. Derivatives of the aer200 fragment carrying point muta-\ntions in the -10 or -35 elements (aer206, aer213, aer214 and\naer224) were constructed by megaprimer PCR. In a first-\nround PCR reaction, a megaprimer was synthesized from\npSR\/aer200 as a template, using a mutagenic primer carrying\nthe desired mutation, and a flanking primer (either D51598 or\nD53041: see Table S1). The megaprimer was then used in a\nsecond-round PCR with the opposing flanking primer and\npSR\/aer200 as a template to generate a full-length promoter\nfragment containing the required mutation, which was then\ncloned into pRW50. The aer212, aer211, aer226 and aer227\nfragments were constructed by inserting or deleting DNA\nbetween the DNA site for CRP and the -35 element of the aer\npromoter. First, two PCR products were synthesized using\npSR\/aer200 as a template: one generated using upstream\nprimer D53041 and a downstream primer carrying the inser-\ntion or deletion, and a second generated using the down-\nstream primer D51598 and an upstream primer carrying the\ninsertion or deletion (see Table S1). The two PCR products\nwere then annealed via their 26\u201332 bp overhangs, and the\ntwo strands were extended using DNA polymerase to gener-\nate a full-length promoter fragment carrying the insertion or\ndeletion. This product was then amplified by PCR using\nprimers D53041 and D51598 and cloned into pRW50.\nb-Galactosidase assays\nb-Galactosidase levels in cells carrying promoter::lacZ\nfusions, cloned in pRW50, were measured using the method\nof Miller (1972).

Activities are shown in Miller units (nmol ONPG\nhydrolysed min-1 mg-1 dry cell mass), and are averages from\nat least three independent experiments.\nPrimer extension\nTranscript start sites were mapped by primer extension as\ndescribed in Lloyd et al. (2008), using RNA purified from\nstrain M182 carrying the aer200 promoter fragment cloned in\npRW50 and 5\u2032 end-labelled primer D49724, which anneals\ndownstream of the HindIII site in pRW50. Primer extension\nproducts were analysed on denaturing 6% polyacrylamide\ngels, calibrated with sequencing reactions, and were visual-\nized using a Fuji phosphor screen and Bio-Rad Molecular\nImager FX.\nProtein purification\nPurified CRP protein was donated by David Grainger (Uni-\nversity of Warwick, UK), and wild type E. coli core RNA poly-\nmerase was purchased from Epicentre Technologies\n(Madison, WI). His-tagged RNA polymerase a subunits con-\ntaining a single cysteine residue at position 302 were pre-\npared and labelled with FeBABE as described by Lee et al.\n(2003). FeBABE-tagged a subunits were incorporated into\ncore RNA polymerase using the reconstitution method of\nTang et al. (1995). Purified s28 and s70 proteins were prepared\nfrom BL21(DE3) cells carrying the overexpression plasmid\npKXH100, as described by Grainger et al. (2008). Es28 and\nEs70 holoenyzmes were made by mixing wild type or\nFeBABE-labelled core RNA polymerase with an equimolar\namount of s28 or s70, and incubating for 20 min at room\ntemperature.\nIn vitro transcription assays\nCaesium chloride preparations of pSR carrying the aer200\npromoter fragment served as a template for multiple-round in\nvitro transcription assays, as described by Savery et al.\n(1998). 20 ng pSR\/aer200 was incubated in transcription\nbuffer containing 40 mM Tris pH 7.9, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM\ndithiothreitol, 100 mM KCl, 100 mg ml-1 bovine serum\nalbumin, 200 mM GTP, 200 mM ATP, 200 mM CTP, 10 mM UTP\nand 5 mCi [a32P]-UTP. Where indicated, CRP was included at\n100 nM and cAMP at 0.2 mM. Reactions were started by\nadding Es28 or Es70. RNA products were analysed on a dena-\nturing 5.5% polyacrylamide gel and visualized using a Fuji\nphosphor screen and Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX.\nFootprinting and EMSA experiments\nKMnO4 and FeBABE footprinting experiments were per-\nformed on PstI-HindIII fragments prepared from caesium\nchloride preparations of pSR carrying aer200. Fragments\nwere labelled at the HindIII end with [g-32P]-ATP using poly-\nnucleotide kinase. KMnO4 footprints were performed follow-\ning the protocol of Browning et al. (2009) and FeBABE\nfootprints were carried out as described by Lee et al. (2003).\nEach reaction contained approximately 3 nM labelled PstI-\nHindIII DNA fragment in 20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2,\n50 mM potassium glutamate, 1 mM DTT and 0.5 mg ml-1\nBSA. KMnO4 footprinting reactions contained 0.2 mM cAMP,\n100 nM CRP and 50 nM Es28 or Es70, as required. FeBABE\nfootprinting reactions contained 0.2 mM cAMP, 100 nM CRP\nand 200 nM FeBABE-labelled Es28. The products of KMnO4\nand FeBABE footprinting reactions were analysed on dena-\nturing 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gels, calibrated with\nMaxam-Gilbert \u2018G + A\u2019 sequencing reactions.\nThe EMSA experiments were performed using EcoRI-\nHindIII fragments prepared from pSR derivatives, and end-\nlabelled using [g-32P] ATP and polynucleotide kinase. EMSA\nreactions were carried out as described by Lloyd et al. (1998)\nand were analysed on 5% polyacrylamide gels. Footprinting\nand EMSA gels were visualized using a Fuji phosphor\nscreen, and analysed using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX\nand Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).\nAcknowledgements\nK.H. was supported by a PhD studentship from the UK\nBBSRC and this work was funded by a Wellcome Trust Pro-\ngramme Grant to S.J.W.B.\nReferences\nBaba, T., Ara, T., Hasegawa, M., Takai, Y., Okumura, Y.,\nBaba, M., et al.
