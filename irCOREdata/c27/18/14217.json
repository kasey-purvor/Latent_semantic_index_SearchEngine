The\nhorror of 11 September will always be, for me, therefore, informed by the sadness that\novercame me when I heard that David had passed away. A man of dignity, advanced\nthought and great kindness, David's contribution to the field of computers in education,\nand to international education in general, was unique. I am privileged to have had the\nopportunity to have learned so much from him in a valuable experience of nearly ten years\nof his excellent graduate teaching and supervision, and will remember well the example of\nholistic expertise that he set.\n92\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\nIntroduction\nThe role of intuitive expertise in ICT graduate education, applied with the kind of fluent\nand spontaneous 'automaticity' demonstrated by expert coaches in sporting and\nperforming arts (Tan, 1997), is the most significant feature of the model of academic\ngraduate supervisor proposed here. Advanced sports coaches are routinely characterized\nby an adept, seemingly spontaneous use of applied expertise, a combination of cognitive,\naffective and mentoring techniques that focus on improving the performance of individual\nathletes, whose attributes are well understood by them. The seemingly effortless fluency\nand holistic serendipity of this model of applied expertise is a key point differentiating this\nconcept of the 'coach-mentor' from existing perceptions of graduate ICT academic\nsupervision.\nIn reviewing recent work (Parsloe and Wray, 2000) on coaching\/mentoring in technology\nuse, Hartley (2001) notes the increasing need to support students 'in skills of communica-\ntion, study methods, creativity, problem-solving and collaborative learning' in a com-\npetitive global economic market, and therefore the increased need for an understanding of\nthe role of coaching\/mentoring in education. Current governmental aims to widen\nparticipation to 50 per cent of the 18-30-year-old population will almost inevitably result\nin a greater need for effective student support at postgraduate level as higher education\nexpands and widens its intake of students (Ainley, Jameson, Jones, Hall, and Farr, 2002).\nIn preparing for this potential expansion, both the performance aspects of coaching and\nthe personal growth characteristics related to mentoring are therefore important in con-\nsidering the effectiveness of academic graduate supervision in supporting student success.\nIn ICT, supervisory fluency in an adept use of coaching\/mentoring techniques incor-\nporates not only a thorough understanding and insightful response to individual students,\nbased on practical experience of the real capabilities of the supervisees, but also the\nbalanced awareness of a multidisciplinary perspective. This emphasizes the inter-\ndisciplinary role of computers in education. Skilled supervisors are able expertly to\nfacilitate graduate students to incorporate in their work significant elements of other key\ndisciplines, while placing an emphasis on pedagogy in education research rather than\ntechnocentric skills acquisition (Papert, 1987).\nInterdisciplinarity in graduate ICT in education study\nIn some ways, the discipline of ICT in education - and its varying closely related con-\nceptualizations as 'computers in education', 'educational computing' or the much more\nwidely conceived field of 'learning technologies' - is an increasingly mature subject area.\nWatson (2001) surveys the growth of ICT in schools' curricula in the UK over the past\ntwenty years, noting that almost thirty major hardware and software initiatives have taken\nplace in this time, the numbers of computers in schools consequently rising from around\none per school in 1980 to one for every eight pupils by 1998. ICT in education can\ntherefore no longer said to be 'new'.\nRoutinely viewed in some governmental initiatives as a panacea for reinvigorating outdated\nteaching methodology, ICT in education, as Watson notes, has been officially hailed - by\nHeseltine in 1995 and David Blunkett in 2001 - as a revolutionary tool to enhance\n'progress' in learning, knowledge acquisition, information skills and economic\n93\nJill Jameson Intuitive expertise in ICT graduate supervision\nadvancement. However, Watson is highly sceptical of what she envisages as the\ntechnocentric and confused nature of a generally over-enthusiastic series of directives on\nthe importance of using computers in education. Drawing attention to the familiar\ndichotomy between ICT as a vocational skills area in its own right, and the use of IT\nlearning technologies as a pedagogic cross-curricular tool, she notes that the conflicts and\nconfusions between these two conceptions of ICT are factors that have sometimes\nbedevilled the actual take-up of technology by teachers in schools. Watson argues that\neducational computing, despite its considerable history, has 'yet to find its own voice' as a\nsubject area, and that what is needed is to 're-frame ICT policy within the process of\neducational debate and change' - that is, to focus on the pedagogical, not merely the\ntechnological contributions of ICT in education. This echoes earlier seminal work\nproposing the key importance of mindful engagement by learners in the use of computers\nas cognitive tools, rather than more automatic usage of computers for browsing or\nmeaningful skills acquisition (Salomon, Perkins and Globerson, 1991).\nIf we are to agree with the well-argued and valuable proposition that learning can be\nenabled by ICT use, but is not mechanistically acquired - either by having advanced\ntechnological resources or the routine skills to use them - then putting the 'pedagogy' back\ninto ICT remains a crucial issue. This highlights again its interdisciplinary nature in\nenabling teaching and learning across the curriculum. The cross-curricular use of IT, or\nCAL, to use the more familiar term, is the side of Watson's dichotomy that still remains to\nbe significantly more developed. ICT in education studies, notably interactive multimedia\nstudies, has for some years already effectively enabled a fluent incorporation of\nmultidisciplinary perspectives. However, one could agree with Watson's observation that\nmeaningful application of this in teaching is still disappointingly rare.\nAlthough as an enabling tool, learning technology can facilitate the learner to weave\ntogether intermingled elements of other disciplines into a rich tapestry that articulates a\nnew language, many teachers - at all levels of education - do not yet speak it very well.\nAdvancements in the incorporation of digital media into 'English', CAD into\n'Engineering', e-Commerce in 'Business' are well-known examples of the transformation\nof subject disciplines by technological IT advances, but such progression does not\nnecessarily lead to more effective learning directly enabled through the use of ICT. As\npedagogy, effective usage of ICT in education aims to enhance conceptual development\nboth in the student-computer interaction with technology and in the cognitive benefit\nderived from the effects of technology. (Salomon et al, 1991).\nIn the two research projects that were the focus of this personal reflection, the subject of\nhypermedia research incorporated an eclectic mix of Computers in Education, English\nLiterature and Media Studies, focusing on active hypermedia authoring by students as a\ndesign process. Through a 'measurement of stages' methodology capturing successive time-\nbased phases of learners' hypermedia work, the doctoral case study, based on extensive\nwork by a small number of further education female adult learners in 1995-7, drew\ninductive inferences from overall patterns observed in students' work. Overall, the final\nstudy found that students had derived benefits in terms of a 'cognitive residue' of self-\nempowerment through an expansion in expressive, creative and problem-solving capability\nenabled in active hypermedia composition (Jameson, 1999).\n94\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\nThe creation of an explanatory model for the hypermedia composition process in novice\nlearners (Jameson and Squires, 1999) and an assessment instrument in the form of a rubric for\nevaluating student hypermedia composition was the result of the research. An emphasis on\nprocess as well as product in hypermedia composition emerged. Stemler (1997) is amongst\nthose who also observe that interactive multimedia is 'a process, rather than a technology, that\nplaces new learning potential into the hands of its users'. Hardware and software make this\nprocess possible, but ultimately the learner-technology interaction is the key enabler in the\nassimilation of old - and the making of new - knowledge. As researchers Kahn and Ullah\n(1997) noted of the Multimedia Makers project, 'the greatest learning involving multimedia\nactually occurs when students create their own multimedia projects - that is, the learning is in\nthe making'. The distinctions made by Papert between instructionism, constructivism, and con-\nstructionism (Papert, 1991), in which the emphasis is on the 'child as builder', are at issue here:\nConstructionism - the N word as opposed to the V word - shares constructivism's\nconnotation of learning as 'building knowledge structures' irrespective of the\ncircumstances of the learning. It then adds the idea that this happens especially\nfelicitously in a context where the learner is consciously engaged in constructing a public\nentity, whether it's a sand castle on the beach or a theory of the universe. (Papert, 1991)\nThe facilitation of graduate students in their own 'making' of research in the learning-\ntechnology interactive process particularly requires a fluency of expertise that, in com-\nbining multiple complex perspectives from a variety of disciplines, has elements beyond an\nexisting accumulation of received knowledge. In other words, the effective graduate ICT in\neducation supervisor needs not just to be an expert in advanced knowledge of the field of\nlearning technologies in education, but to be able to facilitate students intuitively to\nincorporate together previously unknown elements of other disciplines. The facilitation of\ngraduate students making new knowledge in ICT in education requires a degree of\nadvanced combinatory fluency that transcends the application of more singular\ndisciplinary expertise. It also requires a sophisticated and perceptive awareness of student's\nability to handle the cross-disciplinary research problems inherent in merging the divide\nbetween ICT in education and other specific subject disciplines.\nSuch a requirement for spontaneous fluency in the application of supervisory skills in ICT\nin education has some similarities with the demanding work of advanced coaches in the\nfield of physical education, whose dedication to their field can, in some instances, lead to\nsuprisingly good improvements in individual supervisees' performances. In academic\nlearning technologies supervision, a more normative highlighting of ICT in education\nexpertise is also assumed in this model. The emphasis placed here on intuitive spontaneity\nin handling multiple simultanous requirements is to draw out, in the extremity of this\nunusual contrast with physical education, some unexpected extras. These are that ICT\nexpert quality supervision, while aiming to improve the supervisee's understanding and\nperformance, also incorporates a holistic, selective and ultimately intuitive blend of those\n'pedagogic' elements outlined in the 'four presence domains' - 'pedagogical, professional,\ncommercial and managerial' - that Squires (1999) describes in his discussion of the role of\nperipatetic electronic teachers in higher education. In the context of Watson's (2001)\nemphasis that we should concentrate on pedagogy rather than the technocentric\nacquisition of skills (Papert, 1987), these elements can usefully be included within a\nhypothetical model for intuitive expertise in ICT graduate supervision.\n95\nJill Jameson Intuitive expertise in ICT graduate supervision\nMethodology\nAs a personal reflection in the nature of a single-case study, this recollection of supervision\nforms the kind of 'critical' or 'unique case' outlined by Yin (1994) and Robson (1993). The\nunit for analysis in the study was the graduate supervision work carried out by one\nprofessorial supervisor with regard to master's and doctoral level supervision at King's\nCollege School of Education during the period 1990-9. The instance leading to this 'ex\npost facto' single-case reflection (Cohen, Manion and Morrison, 2000) - as opposed to a\nmore normative multiple series of cases - was the untimely death of the supervisor, and the\nwish to record for posterity some successful elements of graduate supervision the\nsupervisor had embodied. An analysis of the supervisory experience from the point of\nview of the supervisee was carried out. Relevant existing research on graduate supervision\nwas taken into account, such as Heath's (2002) quantitative analysis of the views of 355\nPh.D. candidates of their experience in supervision. The role of the graduate supervisor in\nthe field of case-study research in computers in education relating to student composition\nin hypermedia, in particular, was considered.\nA theorized model of intuitive expertise in ICT graduate supervision was therefore\nproposed, drawn from the supervision experience. This theoretical model was informed by\nprior research illustrating key aspects of the requirements for academic supervisors\n(Philips and Pugh, 1994) and for both coaches and mentors, as specified by professional\nsporting and performing arts researchers. An analytically generalizable theory of the role\nplayed by an 'expert ICT supervisor-coach-mentor' was outlined.\nIn view of the undoubted vulnerability of a single participant-observer reflection to bias\nand misrepresentation, this impressionistic study will be followed by an interrogation of\nthe model by graduate students and key informants from King's College. This process will\ntest the analytical generalizability and construct validity (Yin, 1994) of this very roughly\nsketched hypothesized model.\nThe role of the graduate supervisor\nThe role of the supervisor in postgraduate-level academic research study is of particular\nsignificance in the support of students. This sometimes unacknowledged fact is explored\nby both Phillips and Pugh (1994) and Blaxter, Hughes and Tight (1996), who cite nine\nexpectations graduate students routinely have of supervisors, including constructively\ncriticizing written work, being accessible, friendly, supportive, expert and informative in the\nsubject area, and committed to supervisees' success. Phillips and Pugh (1994) also\nparticularly note the role of supervisor as role model, and the essential underlying feature\nof good communication in the supervisor-supervisee interaction.\nThe supervisor-supervisee rapport can be of critical importance in fostering successful\ncompletion of students' written work. Some years ago, Kam (1997) confirmed this general\nrecognition, evidenced by prior research in SERC (1982), Elliott (1983) and Bennett and\nKnibbs (1986), and noted that, 'very little attempt has been made to empirically examine\nthe impact of this relationship on the quality of supervision'. Since Kam's own study on\nwhat he called 'the supervisory dependency factor' in graduate supervision relationships,\nhowever, there have been a number of studies evaluating supervisor-supervisee graduate\nsupervision interaction.\n96\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\nFraser and Mathews (1999) widened out the traditional focus on subject expertise in the\nconsideration of graduate supervisory interaction, by proposing a model including both\nstudent support and a balance of creativity with criticism in supervision. \"While Heath's\nmore recent (2002) study of 355 Australian Ph.D. candidates found that the overwhelming\nmajority (85 per cent) of supervisees expressed satisfaction with the expert knowledge of\ntheir supervisor(s), and 70-85 per cent noted satisfaction with a number of characteristics\nin supervision, not all studies of the supervisory relationship have focused on the\nsupportive elements of what is generally recognized as a hierarchical relationship. Bartlett\nand Mercer (2000) note the combative elements within unequal power relations in graduate\nsupervision, proposing an alternative familial model conceptualized from the point of view\nof experiential and feminist methodology.\nIn effect, such studies indicate that when the partnership between graduate supervisor-\nsupervisee is problematic, the result can be student drop-out or non-completion. Chapman\nand Sork (2001) explore graduate supervision in adult higher education from the point of\nview of problematic power relations, and in their novel study refer particularly to the\nfeminist vs. non-feminist debate in personal narrative methodology. Chapman and Sork\ndescribe a supervisor-supervisee relationship fraught with tensely observed complexities\nthat achieves, uneasily, a useful - and inventive - mutual solution through joint\npublication.\nChapman and Sork's dialogue was informed by the five types of potential power relations\nbetween supervisor-supervisee outlined by Aguinis, Nesler, Quigley, Lee and Tedeschi\n(1996). 'Coercive', 'reward', 'legitimate', 'referent' and 'expert' power relations were\nidentified in this analysis. The contribution of a perceptive and intuitive application of\nexpertise in the supervisor-supervisee graduate research relationship is of particular\nrelevance in this reflection on one successful experience of graduate supervision.\nThis is not necessarily the norm - significant problems with supervision can be so alarming\nto both students and supervisors as to cause depressing failures and student non-\ncompletion. Experience of unproblematic expert collegiate graduate supervision may be\nmuch more routine than some of the literature on this subject would recently indicate, but\nperhaps successful processes of effective supervision can sometimes supply no\noverwhelming reasons for recording this success alongside the completion of already time-\nconstrained doctoral dissertations. A tendency, sometimes, to overlook - or even regard as\nautomatic - the help provided by good supervisors in graduate study needs to be\naddressed. Supervision is not a transparently easy process, and this reflection is drawn up\nwith that recognition in mind.\nIntuitive expertise in ICT graduate supervision\nThe supervisee regarded Professor Squires' role as supervisor to be akin to that of an expert\nsupervisor-coach-mentor. An academic combining friendliness with professional knowledge,\nseriousness of purpose, and an empathetic manner, the supervisee felt that Professor Squires\ninstinctively inspired high levels of academic effort. A routine instance of this was that\nwithout fail, for every supervisory meeting throughout many years of part-time study at\nmasters and doctoral level, the supervisor meticulously prepared commentary on the\nstudent's work and offered detailed advice on it, particularly challenging the supervisee to\n97\nJill Jameson Intuitive expertise in ICT graduate supervision\nreach more advanced levels of understanding in her work. The application of discerning,\nsimultaneously critical and creative analysis, was the norm for all supervision meetings for\nmany years, negotiated through a professional, routinely updated learning contract.\nAn objective 'weighing up' process invariably accompanied this analysis, which in\nacknowledging current strengths and weaknesses and setting new intellectual goals, was\nsomewhat similar to the measurement of an athlete's performance. An openness to the\nsupervisee's own expert disciplinary knowledge in fields unknown to the supervisor was the\nnorm. In bringing the focus back on the application of such disciplines to ICT in\neducation, the challenge to concentrate on the timely achievement of deeper and more\nmeaningful goals encouraged the supervisee to reach further, and aim higher, than\npreviously ventured in any earlier studies.\nThe supervisee therefore began to conceptualize the graduate supervision process in ways\ncomparable with the experience of a potential athlete being 'trained up' by an expert coach\nin sports or performing arts. The analogy of the expert physical education coach can be\nexamined in relation to characteristics outlined by Ferguson and Jubenville (2001). These\nresearchers cite the list of five 'Core Propositions' for effective sports teachers required by\nthe National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS, 2001), alongside expert\ncoaching characteristics identified by DeMarco and McCullick (1997). Selected aspects of\nthis work were mapped out and analysed in relation to the supervisee's experience of David\nSquires's supervision.\nFrom a comparison of the NBPTS Standards (2001) and coaching characteristics\nidentified by physical education researchers DeMarco and McCullick (1997), the\nsupervisee drew up a list of traits for a proposed model of ICT supervision as expert\ncoaching. These were examined in relation to key behavioural characteristics demonstrated\nin supervision during 1990-9. Six traits regarded as desirable for physical education\ncoaches emerging directly from a combination of the NBPTS Standards (2001) and\nDeMarco and McCullick (1997) are the following:\n\u2022 commitment to student learning;\n\u2022 expert knowledge;\n\u2022 superior problem-solving;\n\u2022 instinctive mentoring;\n\u2022 self-monitoring skills;\n\u2022 participation in research culture.\nIn addition, the following traits were identified as particularly useful in relation to ICT in\neducation. In this field, supervisees may face unusually challenging difficulties researching\nthe interface between ICT, education, and other fields of subject-specific knowledge, such\nas English literature, or religious studies, and therefore the following abilities were\nspecifically identified:\n\u2022 intuitive expertise in facilitating students' own interdisciplinary problem-solving and\nadvancement in new fields of knowledge;\n\u2022 experiential insight into individual students' actual\/potential cross-curricular capabil-\nities in ICT in education;\n98\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\n\u2022 innovative mentoring and brokering in supporting new interdisciplinary ICT student\nresearch activities.\nSince the ICT graduate supervisor may be faced with a situation in which s\/he may be\nrequired to supervise ICT supervisees with existing advanced knowledge in fields totally\nunknown to her\/him, the role of intuition and imaginative support becomes crucial. The\napplication of ICT cross-curricular graduate advanced studies to other subject disciplines\nis therefore decidedly challenging for supervisors. In the case of the present study, the\nsupervisee's knowledge of English literature and media studies - which was to inform a\nmajor part of a thesis on the production of hypermedia compositions by further education\nstudents - was a case in point. In this field, the supervisor had little knowledge, and\ntherefore needed to apply significant levels of imaginative effort to encompass the\nmeaningfulness of the other disciplines to the supervisee's studies. Hence the analogy with\nphysical education coaches draws attention to those aspects of supervisory skill that are\nbeyond the planned cognitively specific application of subject knowledge. Fluency,\nadaptability and holistic spontaneity are required of the graduate supervisor to cope with\nthis kind of advanced interdisciplinarity, especially at doctoral level.\nIn her discussion on the supervisory dialogues and strategies needed to support learning\nconversations between staff and students in doctoral supervision, Wisker (2002) reports on\nwork done by Vilkinas (1998) refining Quinn's (1990) 'Dimensions of leadership' model of\ngraduate supervision, which proposes eight roles for the supervisor. Vilkinas adds to these\na ninth dimension - the integrator. The full nine characteristics identified in this\ncomparison of a graduate supervisor with a manager are:\n\u2022 mentor\n\u2022 innovator\n\u2022 broker\n\u2022 producer\n\u2022 director\n\u2022 co-ordinator\n\u2022 monitor\n\u2022 facilitator\n\u2022 with integration at the core of the whole (Wisker, 2002).\nEssentially creative and visionary elements here in supervision are blended with managerial\ntraits. Personally, I find this somewhat managerialist conception of supervision less\ninvigorating than a more holistic model of the supervisor-coach-mentor, informed both by\nrigorous academic graduate supervisory standards and by professional physical education\nmodels of effective supervision. However, the role of 'integrator' provides a holism not\npresent in the earlier Quinn model, and links more with the conception of 'intuitive\nexpertise' envisaged in the ICT graduate supervision grid traced out in Figure 1.\nIn this grid, aspects of the Philips and Pugh (1994) comprehensive guide to Ph.D.\nsupervision are placed side by side with selected key aspects of the NBPTS Professional\n99\nJill Jameson Intuitive expertise in ICT graduate supervision\nIntuitive expertise in\nsupervision model:\ncharacteristics of an\nsupervisor\nICT graduate\nexpert\nPhillips and Pugh (1994): students\nexpect Ph.D. supervisors to:\nNBPTS Professional Sporting\nStandard and De Marco and\nMcCullick's (1997) characteristics\nof expert coach\ncommitted to student learning\nwell prepared\navailable\nfriendly\nsupportive in mentoring\nopen to discussion\nconstructively critical\nchallenging\nincisive\neffective in self-monitoring\nICT-expert\ninvolved in research culture\ngood record of academic work\nsuperior in problem-solving\norganized for tutorials\nopen to debate\ninformative\ninterested in supervisee ideas\ninfluential w'rth peers\ngood networker\ncommitted to student success\nAND:\nintuitive expertise in facilitating\nstudents' own interdisciplinary\nproblem-solving and\nadvancement in new fields of\nknowledge {expert teacher)\nexperiential insight into\nindividual students' actual\/\npotential cross-curricular\ncapabilities in performance in\nICT in education (coach)\ninnovative mentoring and\nbrokering for new\ninterdisciplinary ICT research\nstudent activities (mentor)\nsupervise them\nread their work in advance of a\ndiscussion\nbe available when needed\nbe friendly, open and supportive\nestablish rapport\nbe constructively critical\nhave a good knowledge of the\nresearch area\nact as a role model\nstructure the tutorial so that rt is\nrelatively easy to exchange ideas\nhave sufficient interest in their\nresearch to put more\ninformation in the students'\npath, including introducing\nstudents to others in the field\nbe sufficiently involved in their\nsuccess to help them get a good\njob at the end of it all\ncommitted to student learning\ninstinctive mentor\nself-monitoring skills\nexpert knowledge\nsuperior problem-solving\nparticipation in research culture\ncommitted to student learning\ncommitted to student learning\nparticipation in research culture\nFigure I: Grid mapping different models of supervision\/coach-mentoring against the concept of\nintuitive expertise in graduate ICT supervision\ntoo\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\nSporting Standard and DeMarco and McCullick's (1997) characteristics of an expert\ncoach. These are then mapped against desirable qualities in ICT expert graduate\nsupervision, the broad aspects of each model being ranged against similar traits identified\nin the others. The aspects not explicitly replicated in the same manner elsewhere are ICT-\nlinked concepts of: 1) intuitive expertise in facilitating student interdisciplinary problem-\nsolving and knowledge advancement (expert teacher); 2) experiential insight into students'\ncross-curriculuar capabilities in performance (coach); and 3) innovative mentoring and\nbrokering for new interdisciplinary ICT research student activities (mentor). It is these\nthree aspects, therefore, to which I draw attention in considering the reinvigoration of\npedagogical interdisciplinarity in ICT graduate supervisory experience. This is with\nparticular reference to qualities of fluent holistic integration achieved in notable examples\nof the model of physical education coach-mentor.\n'Intuitive expertise' model of supervision\nIn drawing out characteristics perhaps often assumed, but less routinely identified with\ngraduate supervision, the model of intuitive expertise I propose encompasses also the\ndimensions of experiential insight and innovative mentoring. I argue that these are\nappropriate and timely additional aspects to consider in the reinvigoration of pedagogical\nconceptions of ICT called for by Watson, in her encouragement for educational computing\nto find its own voice, 'a philosophy, a rationale that is fundamentally societal and\npedagogical' (Watson, 2001:264).\nGiven this need for the development - or, as some might see it - reawakening of the\nphilosophy and rationale of ICT in education, I propose that these three additional\ncharacteristics in ICT graduate supervision, if added to the already given eleven\ncharacteristics derived from Philips and Pugh (1994) and Blaxter, Hughes and Tight\n(1996), provide important extra supervisory elements. Highlighting these elements of\nsupervisory expertise, drawn more from models of coaching\/mentoring in physical\neducation than from prior academic role models, provides, in my view, a breath of fresh air\nin the somewhat dry atmosphere of well-worn academic conceptions of supervision.\nThe reason for this is that this conception focuses not solely on the intellectual and social\ncharacteristics routinely required in graduate supervision, nor on the technological\nknowledge assumed in ICT supervision, but on qualities associated with combinatory\naspects of adaptive cognitive complexity, insight into individual students built up from\nexperience and creativity in mentoring human inventiveness. I want to remind us here of\nPapert's definition of technocentric assumptions:\na tendency to reduce what are really the most important components of educational\nsituations - people and cultures - to a secondary, facilitating role. The context for\nhuman development is always a culture, never an isolated technology. In the presence of\ncomputers, cultures might change and with them people's ways of learning and thinking.\nBut if you want to understand (or influence) the change, you have to center your\nattention on the culture - not on the computer. (Papert, 1987)\nFocusing our attention on human development, culture and pedagogy in ICT is not to\nforget the crucial role played by technological knowledge, but to enhance it. The role\nplayed by an expert academic as supervisor-coach-mentor in this iterative process of\n101\nJill Jameson Intuitive expertise in ICT graduate supervision\nIntuitive\nInsightful Expertise in\nSupervision\nImaginative\nInnovative\nfigure 2: Model for intuitive expertise in Id graduate supervision\nenhancing knowledge and learning is subtle. A fine holistic balance of the traits of\nacademic supervision and coaching\/mentoring needs to be applied. In this, the expert\nsupervisor knows his\/her students' potential, and encourages them to achieve the\nmaximum they can within available resources and time.\nDelivering truthful criticism within an overall supportive learning environment is a difficult\nbalance to achieve. In addition to expert knowledge and commitment to the student, the\nexpert supervisor-coach-mentor therefore needs the kind of complex range of skills\nidentified in good teaching in the models outlined above, such as good human\ncommunication, problem-solving, instinctive understanding and interactional skills. If\nboth supervisor and supervisee are genuinely committed to the achievement of success in\nspecialist research within a framework enabled by the coaching\/mentoring environment\noutlined, then difficult issues over subject discipline and personality differences are likely\nto be well handled. Professional differences in subject knowledge and critical comment\nbecome no longer directed at the person, but at the work itself, just as in effective sports\ncoaching, many improvements can be effectively and successfully demanded in a training\nregime within a trusting atmosphere. When trust in the supervisor-supervisee relationship\nis established, it becomes possible to be fundamentally and radically critical about the\nwork without the other person taking offence. Constructive criticism of both intra-\ndisciplinary differences and the supervisor's style by the supervisee should also be delivered\neffectively within such a framework. Overall, a useful working balance of intellectual and\naffective elements can result in supervision perceived by both parties to be effective.\n102\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\nConclusion\nThe model of intuitive'expertise in ICT graduate supervision outlined here examines a\nholistic rounded view of the supervisor-supervisee experience in supervision, considering a\nrange of supervisory characteristics in the concept of expertise. These focus not merely on\nintellectual capability and depth of knowledge, but encompass a holistic blend of affective,\nsocial, communicative and other areas of advanced skill not always routinely conceptual-\nized as part of supervision. Three new characteristics in ICT graduate supervision are\nproposed, building on already-given qualities in prior models of graduate supervision.\nAttributes of effective coach-mentors in professional physical education are placed\nalongside these in a grid and examined in relation to the proposed model for ICT super-\nvision. In the author's experience, Professor David Squires demonstrated advanced\ncapabilities as a supervisor derived from the kind of matrix of complex supervisory\ncharacteristics outlined and visually sketched in the concept of supervision as intuitive\nexpertise. This small single-case reflective analysis aims to capture a brief portrait of some\nof these elements, to contribute to the literature on effective graduate supervision for the\nbenefit of future supervisors and students. Merely a transitory ex post facto memorial\nreflection, the model sketched here is drawn up in an awareness of the multiple potential\nflaws inherent in a subjective single-case participant-observer attempt to capture some\nuseful elements of supervision that will be tested with key informants in the future.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author wishes to acknowledge David Squires himself for the work done throughout\nmany years of graduate supervision.
