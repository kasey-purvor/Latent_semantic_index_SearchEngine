In these \nurban locations, the need to manage difference is synonymous to making them \nliveable and one\u2019s own. In seeking (and sometimes finding) a location in the city and \na location in the world, urban dwellers shape their communication practices as forms \nof everyday, mundane and bottom up tactics for the management of diversity. The \npaper looks at three particular areas where cultural diversity and urban \ncommunication practices come together into meaningful political and cultural \nrelations for a sustainable cosmopolitan life: citizenship, imagination and identity.  \n \nIntroduction  \nIf we look at the city, rather than the state, it is because we have given up hope that \nthe state might create a new image for the city (Derrida, [1997] 2006, p. 6).  \n     The western global city is an intensely cosmopolitan location. Possibly more than \nany other location, the global city brings people, technologies, economic relations, \nand communication practices into unforeseen constellations and intense juxtapositions \nof difference (Benjamin, 1997) that contribute to the routing and rooting of the \ncommunicative city\u2019s interface. Especially in the urban neighbourhoods where people \nof different origins, cultural customs, and migrant histories live cheek by jowl, we can \n 1\nobserve appropriations of technologies and communication practices that relate to \ncitizenship, imagination and belonging. Zones of the inner city or zones hugging \nuncomfortably the outer city give rise to neighbourhoods that are indispensable \nelements of the global city and, I would argue, crucial elements in defining its creative \nand communicative interface. The intense urban juxtapositions of difference in the \nunglamorous, and often marginalised and deprived, quarters of the global cities are \nusually invisible in tourist brochures, and even in relevant research. They are however \nlocations, where the potential and power of communication to connect people in the \nlocale and across boundaries, in shared attempts to seek citizenship, to find a location \nin the city and the world, and to shape identity in the global cosmopolis are revealed \nin intensity rarely observed elsewhere. These are also locations that reveal the \nlimitations of communication -and of the communicative city itself- in solving \nproblems of inequality, cultural and geographical divides and lack of representation \nwithin the nation. This paper addresses the interconnection between lived cultural \ndiversity in the global city and its communicative interface in three distinct, though \ninterconnected, sections; each section addresses one theme about this relation. The \nfirst theme is about citizenship and representation, and in particular, the formation of \ncultural citizenship in the city vis-\u00e0-vis the restrictive and excluding political \ncitizenship of the nation. The second theme focuses on urban mediated imagination as \na tool that individuals and groups use to locate themselves in the city and in the world. \nThe third theme explores (cosmopolitan) identities and urban dwellers\u2019 attempt to root \nthemselves in urban and transnational locations, often through appropriations of \nmedia and communications. Though this paper is not an empirical endeavour, it draws \nfrom empirical research conducted in the global cities of London and New York City \n 2\nand in cosmopolitan European cities, such as Amsterdam and Athens; some empirical \nmaterial are used to illustrate the paper\u2019s arguments.  \n \nWhat is particularly communicative about the global city?   \nRobins (2001) suggests that we should think through the city, instead of through the \nnation, because the city allows us to reflect on the cultural consequences of \nglobalization from another than a national perspective. \u2018The nation, we may say, is a \nspace of identification and identity, whilst the city is an existential and experimental \nspace\u2019 (2001, p. 87). What Robins refers to as existential and experimental space is \nprobably better captured by Walter Benjamin\u2019s discussion of unforeseen \nconstellations and juxtapositions of difference in the city (1997). When it comes to the \ncosmopolitan city, we see skyscrapers, which house transnational corporations, next \nto humble and often impoverished multicultural neighbourhoods. Global cities, like \nLondon and New York, host some of the major media and communications \ncorporations that control significant trends within global information production and \ndistribution. At the same time, the city is not only in control of corporate and large \nscale innovation. If one looks beyond the corporate skyscrapers, the city appropriates \na collection of communication technologies of various scales, kinds, legality and \ncontrol. These include such variety as analogue pirate radio stations broadcasting out \nof council estate flats and state of the art productions on satellite and digital platforms. \nThus -and as Benjamin challenges us to think- the city is not only an experimental \nspace, but also a political space where struggles for power, control and ownership are \nreflected and shaped through the intense (mediated) meetings of people, technologies \nand places. While for the major global corporations located in the city\u2019s skyscrapers, \ncontrol of media and communications is primarily driven by profit, for many urban \n 3\ndwellers, attempts to control media and communications largely relates to access to \nknowledge, citizenship, identity and representation. The complicated -and even over-\nambitious- appropriations of media and technologies in humble multicultural \nneighbourhoods reveal a plebeian cosmopolitanism that makes little impression to the \ncorporate, political or tourist\u2019s gaze to a consumerist or elitist cosmopolitanism. \nHowever, this is a political, experimental and cultural cosmopolitanism that \ncontributes to understanding why and how seeking (and sometimes finding) \nrepresentation in global cities often takes place outside formal political and economic \nrelations.   \n     This plebeian cosmopolitanism includes informal economies, knowledge transfer \nand locally framed entertainment choices that shape systems of communication and \ncreativity; these partly reproduce global cultures of consumerism and partly contest \nand re-appropriate them (for example, in pirate communication products exchange). It \nalso reflects new forms of citizenship, which come with demands for representation \non national and transnational domains, include unstable loyalties and have cultural, \npolitical and economic dimensions, all at the same time. \n \nUrban communication without much glamour but with much significance \nExtensive migration and travel, but also virtual everyday mediated travel and intense \ninterconnections through appropriations of media and communications, are some of \nthe major developments that destabilise the dominance of the nation as the political \nand cultural core of contemporary societies. Migration and travel are inherently linked \nto the establishment of global cities as major financial centres, interconnected among \nthemselves and less connected to or dependent from the nation-state (Sassen, 2001). \nThe economy of the global city attracts large numbers of migrants, who become key \n 4\nactors for both city life and global economy (Eade, 2000; Massey, 2005; Sassen, \n2001). Migrant and diasporic urban over-concentration, often in parallel to a decrease \nof the native population, transforms the city into a particular geographical location, \nwhere meetings are intense and often unpredictable. Groups of people -who, \nsometimes by need or by coincidence, come together in urban locations- do not only \ntransform urban demography but also bring into urban life new desires and needs. \nThough origins, languages and cultures might vary, for the culturally diverse urban \ndwellers, a set of important needs and desires are shared: employment, housing, \neducation, security, well-being and representation. In this context, across multicultural \nneighbourhoods we can observe similar sets of informal, face to face and mediated \nsystems of communication. They serve as shared tools, but also as initiators of human \ninterconnection, as distributors of information, and as mechanisms for sharing \nknowledge and building community infrastructure and sustainability. To the \nresearcher and inhabitant of the culturally diverse locations of the city, local ethnic \npress, radio and television stations, community centres, multilingual internet caf\u00e9s, \ngraffiti and other forms of public communication of messages in multilingual boards \nand wall messages are familiar methods of communication that reflect the dual \nidentity of each urban place as a particular location (hosting specific groups) and as a \ntransnational location, being always connected, not only to here, but also to some \nplaces elsewhere.   \n     Communication practices in the multicultural neighbourhoods of the city tend to be \nbanal and ordinary, thus present little interest to studies on cosmopolitan creative and \nmedia industries. Such attention is attracted in the rare cases of urban musical success \nin the mainstream media scenes and in urban art\u2019s rare entries into museums and \ngalleries. Attention to the communicative interface of the multicultural \n 5\nneighbourhoods also comes when links between communication practices and \nextremism, terrorism and violence are come to light. However, attention fades away \nwhen it comes to the urban denizens\u2019 tactics of surviving the city, of making a city \none\u2019s one, and of finding spaces of representation outside exclusive or excluding \npolitics of national and commercial interests. The banal communication practices, \ninvolved in the establishment of urban dwellers\u2019 own media, in the use of digital \ntechnologies, and in the consumption of diverse media from the national and global \nmainstream, next to the urban and transnational \u2018alternative\u2019, expose processes of \nseeking a voice and citizenship outside the national political framework and reflect \nattempts to seek horizontal, deterritorialised and global connections (Eade, 2000). \n      \nThe city of refuge  \nNext to the characteristics of the global city that derive from its recent intense \neconomic, human and communication interconnections and which have shaped it as \nan intense global communication hub, another urban quality makes it an important \nlocation for understanding the close link between urban communication and cultural \ndiversity. Derrida talks about the city of refuge ([1997] 2006), which has its origins in \nEuropean, para-European and western traditions, such as the urban right to immunity, \nhospitality and sanctuary. The city of refuge invites reflection on the role of a \ncosmopolitics beyond the excluding politics of the nation. Derrida invites us to \nunderstand the city as both a celebrated location of difference but also as a location of \nduty and right to the politics of difference. The global cities are (or should be) cities \nof refuge. According to Derrida\u2019s definition, the cities of refuge are autonomous from \neach other and from the state, but they are also linked to each other, while they benefit \nfrom mediated interconnections to various global locations. One of the contributions \n 6\nthe cities of refuge are expected to make within cosmopolitics is the reorientation of \nthe politics of the state so that rules of solidarity and hospitality can apply across \ncities and state sovereignty.  \n     What is particularly relevant here about the tradition, experience and orientation of \nthe cities of refuge, as discussed by Derrida, is the acknowledgement of cultural \ndiversity as an inherent and political element of the city that makes it what it is. The \n(global) city cannot exist without its cultural diversity, its intense mediated \ninterconnections within its territory and across the globe, and its politics that \nchallenge national geographical authority and national and exclusive political \ncitizenship. The city has gained its political and cultural significance because of these \ncontroversial characteristics, which also make it a desirable and exciting location, a \nlocation that people turn to in looking for hospitality, security and for making a home \nin a cosmopolitan world.  \n \nCultural citizenship coming into life in the city \nThe cosmopolitan city hosts large numbers of people who have no or limited access to \nresources centrally controlled by the national and city authorities (e.g. employment, \neducation, health). Usually, these are the same urban dwellers excluded or \nmarginalised within the western nation-state\u2019s systems of political citizenship. For the \nvast majority of the western nation-states, political citizenship systems are based on \nterritoriality and on one of the two methods of claiming citizenship (or a combination \nof the two). One can claim citizenship based on parenthood (the ius sanguinis system) \nor based on a system of restrictive residency (the ius soli system). \u2018[T]erritoriality has \nbecome an anachronistic delimitation of material functions and cultural identities; yet, \neven in the face of the collapse of traditional concepts of sovereignty, monopoly over \n 7\nterritory is exercised through immigration and citizenship policies\u2019, argues Benhabib \n(2004: 5), explaining the tension between human and cultural transnationalism on the \none hand, and state persistence on territorial boundedness on the other. This same \nmodel, which derives from Enlightenment ideals, privileges (and desires) unity \nagainst diversity and results to the inevitable incompatibility between citizenship \nrights and cosmopolitan urban dwellers\u2019 needs, desires and sense of (transnational) \nbelonging.   \n     Deriving from Enlightenment is also the separation between three different zones \nof citizenship: the political (the right to reside and vote); the economic (the right to \nwork and prosper); and the cultural (the right to know and speak) (Miller, 2007). The \nthird kind of citizenship is often undermined by an emphasis on the previous two, \nthough it gains increasing importance among transnational communities, such as \nmigrants and diasporas. Cultural citizenship addresses mechanisms of informal, \ncultural and communication practices of groups that seek representation in local, \nnational and transnational spaces. Historically, formal political citizenship in nation-\nstates has depended on rules of loyalty to the nation\u2019s ideology of politics (and often \nof religious and cultural dominant practices) and acceptance of a homogenous and \nsingular cultural and political society. As a result, often minorities have turned to \npractices outside the formal political system in order to seek representation (including \ndeveloping mechanisms of representation and\/or information exchange in own media \nand in their locales). Pakulski writes that: \u2018claims for cultural citizenship involve not \nonly tolerance of diverse identities but also -and increasingly- claims to dignified \nrepresentation, normative accommodation, and active cultivation of these identities \nand their symbolic correlates\u2019 (cited in Flew, 2007, p. 77). Claims for cultural \ncitizenship also entail claims on institutional level (e.g. anti-discrimination politics), \n 8\nas well as recognition of media and other creative industries\u2019 production as forms of \nrepresentation of diversity in contemporary culturally diverse democracies (Flew, \n2007). \n     Nation-states\u2019 focus on a specific set of political rights and obligations (e.g. vote \nand loyalty to the state) defined by territoriality and exclusivity have failed to \nrecognise (or welcome) the significance of migrant and diasporic hybridity and \ntransnationalism as elements of a cosmopolitan citizenship. In this context, the \ncultural (diversity) has become an area of contestation rather than of recognition. \nMany western nation-states now see creativity and media production by groups \ncharacterised by intense transnationality as threats rather than as potentials for \ndemocratic representation. Nation-states\u2019 unease with cultural strategies for \ntransnational recognition are expressed, for example, in the shift towards cohesion \nand integration policies vis-\u00e0-vis multicultural policies in countries such as Britain or \nThe Netherlands. Next to the nation-state\u2019s scepticism -or even hostility in many \ncases- towards recognition of cultural citizenship, comes the celebration of a \nconsumerist cultural citizenship by corporate ideologies. The corporate approach to \ncultural citizenship tends to strip it from its political significance and celebrates it as a \nsynonym of the unprincipaled, classless, ageless and raceless consumer (Miller, \n2007).  \n     Outside -and often in contrast- to the national and corporate reactions to cultural \ncitizenship, the city becomes a space where creativity and media production turn into \ncultural and political strategies for seeking recognition, especially among those \nexcluded from other forms of representation in political and cultural life. As already \nargued, the city depends on intense juxtapositions of difference, connections and \nmobility beyond the restrictions of the nation-state. It thus creates spaces for \u2018new \n 9\ncitizenship rules based on mobile and transferable rights of personhood\u2019 (Amin and \nThrift, 2002, p.94). Some of the tensions observed in the relations between the \nculturally diverse urban dwellers are the outcome of the conflict between cultural \nbelonging in transnational worlds and the obligations to fulfil formal demands of \nexclusive regimes of citizenship. In acknowledging the limitations of the political \n(and nationally-defined) citizenship and  its distinction from stronger variants of \ncultural citizenship, we need to locate the role of both communication and the city as \nframes, tools and agents in shaping cultural citizenship. Urban creativity becomes \nparticularly interesting in this case. Often attached to the tactics of seeking \nrepresentation outside the restrictive national framework, urban (mediated) cultural \nproduction includes creations on city walls, local radio stations, urban music and \nnightlife cultures. This creativity, whose origin is often not easy to track down, is the \noutcome of juxtapositions and meetings (not always without conflict) that take place \nin the city (and particularly the humble multicultural neighbourhoods).  \n     Excluded from citizenship rights, education and Eurocentric and corporate \ncultures, migrants and members of diasporic groups (especially young people) often \nengage in such alternative forms of (mediated) expression and self-representation. \nSome of these creative practices are initiated as political acts of opposition to the state \nor to excluding politics of representation. For example, as graffiti, software piracy and \nradio piracy are illegal acts, the meanings of such practices are shaped in the context \nof illegality, opposition or rejection of the politics of the state. The cultural and social \nlocations of such acts and the enactment of these practices by young, usually \ndisenfranchised and minority youth, reflects -if not singularly, at least partly- \nprocesses of active opposition to state and corporate cultures that provide them no \nspace for representation or respect. Such creative practices sometimes allow urban \n 10\ndwellers to develop a common (plebeian) cosmopolitan language of communication \nin the locale and across global spaces. Especially media practices, such as music \nproduction and consumption and online broadcasting, might connect the local urban \nto the transnational global, while surpassing what might be an irrelevant and \nrepressive national framework.  \n \nFinding a location in the world through urban imaginaries      \nNo longer mere fantasy (opium for the masses whose real work is elsewhere), no \nlonger simple escape (from a world defined principally by more concrete purposes \nand structures) and no longer mere contemplation (irrelevant for new forms of desire \nand subjectivity), the imagination has become an organised field of social practices, a \nform of work (both in the sense of labour and of culturally organised practice) and a \nform of negotiation between sites of agency (\u2018individuals\u2019) and globally defined fields \nof possibility\u2019 (Appadurai, 1996, p. 73-4).  \n     The city is a location of difference and a host of \u2018media imaginings which activate \nand boost the imagination but also channel and limit it, precisely through the spread \nand utilization of the media in everyday life\u2019 (Amin and Thrift, 2002, p. 116). The \ncosmopolitan city takes a privileged position in global media culture, as it hosts large \nnumbers of media and even larger numbers of media consumers. The growth of media \nand communication innovation in the city is widely recognised as a cultural and \neconomic strength; the development of media and communications industries is \ncelebrated by the authorities as an asset and as an indication of a powerful \ncosmopolitan culture. there is an element of this industry though, which tends to be \nless celebrated and less welcome -this is the area of media production (and \nconsumption) by urban diasporic and migrant dwellers. Such production is extensive \n 11\nand usually rooted in the same urban hubs as the major national and transnational \ncommercial media. Even more so, these other media gain ground in terms of their \nconsumption in those urban locations and among consumers who are also consumers \nof national and transnational mainstream media. The diversification of urban \nmediascapes is dealt with unease and concern by politicians and policy makers on \nlocal, national and transnational level as there are many misunderstandings about their \nrole as mechanism for promoting imagined belonging and loyalties to distant \nhomelands. Some local authorities in Austria, Britain, The Netherlands and elsewhere \nhave gone as far as to ban the installation of satellite dishes, which aim at receiving \ntransnational channels (Georgiou, 2003). The official or hidden reason for the ban is \nthe state concern with the construction of competitive imagined communities through \nthe media. While such top-down government initiatives are becoming more frequent, \non the ground and especially in the multicultural neighbourhoods of the city, it is \nalmost impossible to control the density of satellite dishes. In such neighbourhoods of \nAmsterdam, Athens, London and Paris, satellite dishes become a recognisable sign of \ntransnationality and of an urban imaginary that expands its boundaries of symbolic \nconnections across its streets and across transnational media highways.  \n     Unlike the fears of authorities as regards the diversity of urban media production \nand consumption that gives rise to a threatening imagination locked into another \nexclusive and foreign public sphere, urban communication practices show that \nimagination increasingly moves away from exclusive national communities and rather \nreveals qualities of multiple and multipositioned imaginings (Aksoy and Robins, \n2000; Georgiou, 2006). My unpublished recent study of urban young members of \nmedia audiences in London and Leeds has provided an up-to-date picture of the \nglobal mediated landscapes that users of transnational diasporic media construct. \n 12\nParticipants in this study who have access to the controversial transnational satellite \nchannel Al Jazeera (English and\/or Arabic language programme) have revealed in \ntheir words and practice the complex implications of having access and consuming \ntransnational media. In the case of the Al Jazeera consumers asked, access to the \nspecific medium has advanced critical engagement with all media and a deep \nappreciation of the potential to getting access to diverse sources of information, each \nwith their own positive and negative characteristics. All participants watching Al \nJazeera and other diasporic media products explain how they never just watch \ndiasporic television but also mainstream national, local and transnational media. Thus, \nthe diasporic medium does not become a carrier of an alternative exclusive imagined \ncommunity but rather a comparative element for being part in imaginary global \nworlds. In the words of a 20-year-old participant:  \n \nI watch Al Jazeera \u2013 they show everything on the spot. If there is a murder \ntaking place in Iraq or something, it is there on TV and then it\u2019s exclusive. \nThat\u2019s what I like about it. With BBC, they tend to cut out some violent \nscenes. Obviously because they are considered as not suitable.  \n \n     When asked if he watches less of the mainstream national BBC now that he has \naccess to Al Jazeera, he has no hesitation to declare: \u2018No, BBC is on the normal (i.e. \nterrestrial) channels.  Al Jazeera is on digital, so if I find something interesting on it \nI\u2019ll watch it but usually I\u2019ll just watch BBC\u2019. For another participant, Al Jazeera is a \nnew source of information he discovered in an Arab friend\u2019s house. Though this \nperson has no direct diasporic connections, he finds Al Jazeera a fascinating \nalternative to British media, which offers a different outlook to world affairs. These \n 13\ntwo examples reveal two elements of diasporic media\u2019s role in shifting boundaries \nfrom national spaces of imagined belonging to transnational ones. In the first case, the \ndiasporic medium provides a daily check to viewpoints presented in mainstream \nBritish and other western media. These examples also show that access to diverse \nmedia advances the critical outlook towards both the diasporic and the mainstream \nmedia. The urban dweller and global media consumer above is critical of what he sees \nas (self-)censorship in British media on the one hand and of the excessive violence on \nthe programmes of Al Jazeera on the other. Availability of diverse media has become \na constant mechanism for constructing an imagination that includes different worlds, \nor different elements of one world. Another dimension of urban imaginings revealed \nin these examples, is the way the culturally diverse city becomes a mediator of \nvarious symbolic worlds. Urban dwellers who are not diasporic subjects themselves \nsometimes gain entry to imagined worlds beyond those framed narrowly by national \nand western media because of their close proximity to people and media from \ndifferent cultures. Transnational imagination becomes part of everyday life \n(Appadurai, 1996) and the possibility of moving -either physically or through \nmediation- between and across landscapes is neither a futuristic fantasy nor an issue \nexclusively relevant to members of a diaspora.  \n  \nCosmopolitan identities for a cosmopolitan world? \n\u2018How can the hosts and guests of cities of refuge be helped to recreate, through work \nand creative activity, a living and durable network in new places and occasionally in \na new language?\u2019 Derrida ([1997] 2006: 12). \nIn the culturally diverse hubs of the city, the aesthetics and the conduct of everyday \nlife in the street and in public domains such as libraries, pubs, ethnic grocery shops \n 14\nand community centres, are constant reminders of the close proximity of difference \nand of the diversity that finds expression in public and private urban life. The purity \nand the privatised closure of the suburbia and of zones with little linguistic and \ncultural diversity are challenged in urban everyday life, which refuses to be enclosed \nin private and secluded domestic domains. Loud and contesting musical themes \ncoming out of cars, multilingual signs on high streets, competing religious symbols in \nneighbouring places of worship, and exchanges of products, including music, film, \nand computer programmes, all reveal the multiplicity of possibilities for belonging \nhere (and as a consequence there as well). The top-down ideologies that dominate the \nlocations of the city representing the centres of power (e.g. around Parliament houses \nand tourist sights) promote a shared and common identity, resting upon similar \naesthetics and practices that respect privacy, national liberal democracy and global \nconsumer culture. But culturally diverse neighbourhoods challenge this national \nimagination on a daily basis. Urban pockets become spaces for performative \nidentities, which take their shape around struggles for representation of various \ncultures, cacophonous aesthetics and diverse interpretations and practices of global \npopular culture, democracy, law and order (even in their direct violation). Such \nperformative identities are often excluded from the mainstream media and the \nimaginary of national cohesion; they are often treated by the state with uncomfortable \ninability to understand or as potential threats to the ideology of the nation and western \nmodernity.  \n     Performative urban identities increasingly move away from the national imaginary \nand media and communications become experimental tools in this process. This does \nnot mean that urban appropriations of media and technologies are always safe, \ndemocratic and dialogic. The cases when media are used as effective systems to \n 15\ncompete with and to contest other cultures, to spread political and religious \npropaganda and to undermine dialogical communication that takes place in the street \nexist next to emancipating and democratic media projects. What all projects have in \ncommon is that they reflect elements of a dissident cosmopolitanism outside exclusive \nnational zones. Importantly, what we increasingly observe among the newest forms of \nurban media production, is a contestation of national frameworks of belonging, not \nonly in relation to the country of settlement, but also in relation to the country of \norigin. Projects such as multicultural radio stations, urban art production and \nexperimentations with technologies outside ethnically exclusive spaces reveal new \nforms of identities that have more to do with cosmopolitan life than with exclusive \nethnic and national spheres of belonging. Some of those public locations, where we \ncan observe a dissident cosmopolitanism and interethnic explorations of identities are \nthe local internet caf\u00e9s and telecommunication centres. These public spaces have \ngrown to be distinctive cultural and communication hubs of multiculturalism, \nproviding relatively cheap and easy access to diverse mediascapes and opening up \npossibilities for creative, locally grounded and dialogical experimentations with \n(mediated) belonging. My ethnographic observations in London have shown that \nmany of these centres\u2019 users are not just customers and consumers of specific \ntechnologies, but also active participants in micro-communities of techno-habitu\u00e9s of \nthe virtual and physical space developing around the caf\u00e9\u2019s life.  These places become \nmeeting points and pubic spaces where minorities, excluded from other formal and \ncontrolled public places, gather, socialise and shape elements of their identities as \nurban dwellers and (connected) global cosmopolitans.  \n     Internet access in local caf\u00e9s and communication centres mediates understanding \namong emergent communities of people who might not share an origin, but who share \n 16\ncommon present interests, location and curiosity about close and distant (mediated) \nworlds. Diasporic and interethnic dialogue in these places becomes a natural \ningredient of their function as communicative, multi-use spaces and thus reflects the \nemergence of new spaces for belonging in locales that are increasingly diverse and \nconnected to the world through their human and technological capital. These locations \nbecome hubs for translating and speaking across local and transnational difference; \nthese distinctly urban spaces (sometimes co-hosting internet caf\u00e9s, telecommunication \ncentres, grocery shops, hairdressers and beauticians) are reflecting the dialogical \nimagination of a cosmopolitan outlook, observed by Beck (2006). What Beck argues \nis that cosmopolitan outlook opens up a space of dialogical imagination in everyday \nlife and forces us to develop the art of translation and bridge-building. Such locations \nimpose -and sometimes force- the coexistence of difference while forming an exercise \nof \u2018boundary transcending imagination (Beck, 2006, p. 89).\u2019  \n     Communal media consumption can also advance a sense of community and \ncommonality among internet caf\u00e9s\u2019 users and others in far away places (who are \nthough connected and accessible). Thus, physical co-presence, next to imagined \npresences (Urry, 2000), redefines spaces of belonging beyond national \u2018communities \nof sentiment and interpretation\u2019 (Gilroy, 1995: 17). Media \u2018images can connect local \nexperiences with each other and hence provide powerful sources of hermeneutic \ninterpretation to make sense of what would otherwise be disparate and apparently \nunconnected events and phenomena\u2019 (Urry, 2000, p. 180).   \n \nUrban systems of communication mediate cosmopolitan identities \nLiving in the city comes with the development of certain strategies and tactics for \nmanaging diversity and close contact with others (such as protection against crime; \n 17\ndevelopment of micro-communities and networks of (trans-)local support; use of \nselective entertainment, communication and transport resources in the city). It also \ncomes with informal systems of knowledge, often mediated, that develop in the \nsociality that comes with urban diversity. Interpersonal relations, as well as the mere \nclose proximity of difference, relates to these strategies. As two interviewees \nparticipating in my recent research acknowledge, living in London provides them with \nunique cosmopolitan connections to the world: \n \nDefinitely, I know more about places because I live in London. My \nfriends\u2026people here come from all over the place. You just automatically \npick it up, it\u2019s not like you seek it to find it out. One of my friends is Muslim. I \ndon\u2019t go out of my way to learn about Islam. It\u2019s just through when he speaks. \nI learn this way. \n \nThere are loads of small minded people -especially in England and outside of \nLondon. London is very multicultural and diverse but outside of London \npeople don\u2019t get to interact with other cultures like us here. So they just see \nwhat they know and become narrow-minded.  \n \nUrban mediated and face to face communication practices sustain -and even boost- \ncosmopolitan identities, possibly like in no other location. Cosmopolitan identities do \nnot erase the importance of origin and particularity, but privilege and depend upon a \ndiverse and inclusive universalism that contrasts nationally defined universalisms of \nexclusive commitment to one single community. This cosmopolitan and more \ninclusive universalism is often observed in people\u2019s words (as above), but also in \n 18\nlocal media projects, such as in pirate and community radio. Such projects tend to \ncombine a dual focus upon the particular and the universal, creating unique platforms \nfor intercultural dialogue (even when, and as a rule, always, with their limitations). \nThe case of Sound Radio (soundradio.org.uk) in the multicultural Hackney, London is \na characteristic example. This community radio prides itself for being a \u2018positive \nvoice from East London\u2019 and a multilingual, multicultural output of local voices. At \nthe same time, it prides itself for having listeners across continents \u2013 which includes \nNorth and South America and Southeast Asian in particular (with the rest of the world \nalso being represented among listeners). It broadcasts in 13 languages in an attempt to \ngive voice to the local diverse communities of East London but also in order to \nadvance links between the locality and the rest of the world. At the same time, local \nagendas predominate production, with education and crime being among the most \nreported topics, but also local musical and artistic creativity taking significant space in \nthe coverage of local events. The case of Sound Radio presents one of those occasions \nwhere the identity of a medium becomes a political and cultural projection of a \ncosmopolitan identity for both the urban locale and its culturally diverse inhabitants. \nThe cosmopolitan new places and the new languages of communication that Derrida \n([1997] 2006) suggest that can (and should) emerge in the city of refuge are possibly \nnot very different to the words of the two Londoners above or the production values \nand output projected by experimental communication initiatives, such as London\u2019s \nSound Radio.  \n \nTo conclude\u2026. \nThe communication practices discussed in this paper reflect urban denizens\u2019 attempts \nto find representation and to develop a dynamic politics of identity in a cosmopolitan \n 19\nworld. They represent the efforts of the diverse city\u2019s dwellers to fulfil their needs and \nto integrate the complexity of their spatial and cultural journeys into politics of \nrepresentation. They also project their efforts to take representation and identification \nin their hands, by dismissing, resisting and contesting the restrictions and the rules \nposed by financial and political centres of power that control symbolic and material \nsources on national and transnational level. The development of communication \nactivities are sometimes singularly crucial -and even desperate- acts for seeking \ncitizenship in urban and national worlds, especially when political and cultural life in \nthe national and global mainstream provides no entry point to those at the bottom of \nthe social ladder and those who have no formal political rights. Communication and \nmedia practices do not only reflect possibilities for representation and identity \nconstruction, but they also reveal the limitations of access to tools that further \ncitizenship and participation. Most of the communication activities discussed in the \nprevious sections balance between three poles: the marginalised alternative creativity \n(e.g. the production and consumption of urban music, of diasporic and local media), \nthe ephemeral (e.g. encounters around media consumption in the street and in public \nlocal spaces), and the illegal\/semi-legal appropriations of media and communications \n(e.g. piracy, graffiti). This delicate balance invites further deliberation around the \nunderstanding of the overall potentials of cultural and political activity in the city as \nregards wider issues of representation and equality. This is a big challenge and the \nanswers attempted here cannot but be incomplete. This paper\u2019s discussion on some of \nthe possibilities for representation and identity emerging in urban communication, the \nreference to the reflections of urban dwellers on these potentials, and the emergence \nof communities through unpredictable appropriations of communication technologies, \n 20\nhopefully contribute to the discussion on the communicative city\u2019s contribution to \nprojects of participation and inclusion.             \n     This discussion has only recently began and it demands further theoretical and \nempirical explorations, especially as regards the long-term political relevance of \ncommunication practices that take place in banal manners and in humble locations. \nWhat already emerges as an important point that needs further emphasis and \narticulation is the close interconnection between the cultural and the political. What \nthis interconnection already indicates it that, even if limited or conditional, the role of \nthe communicative city for identity, imagination and citizenship, can signify \nimportant conceptual and practical possibilities for understanding participation and \nrepresentation in increasingly diverse, mediated and cosmopolitan worlds.  \n \nReferences  \nAksoy, A. and K.
