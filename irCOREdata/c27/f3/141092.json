It is widely used in the preparation of physiologically active \ncompounds.[1] This makes it an important target for the development of catalytic \nsystems.[2-4] One approach towards the rational design of catalysts is the production of \nantibodies against a transition state analogue (TSA) as demonstrated for the Diels-Alder \nreaction by the Janda group.[5,6] \n \nAn approach analogous to the production of catalytic antibodies can be seen in the preparation \nof catalytic molecularly imprinted polymers. Molecular imprinting is carried out by \npolymerisation of commonly two types of monomer (one functional monomer and one cross-\nlinker) in presence of a template, giving, after removal of the template, a polymer with \nselective recognition sites for the template \u2013 essentially a plastic antibody.[7-14] If a structure \nsimilar to a certain transition state is used as template, the resulting polymer can \u2013 just as a \ncatalytic antibody \u2013 be expected to stabilise the transition state, catalysing the corresponding \nreaction.[13] While a growing number of catalytic polymers have been designed and \nsynthesised for a number of different reaction types, e.g. ester hydrolysis[15-25], \ntransamination[26], \u03b2-elimination[27,28], only a few reports deal with C-C bond formation, \ne.g. aldol[29,30], Suzuki[31], and Diels-Alder reactions[32-34].  \n \nWe recently described a previously unreported temperature dependent behaviour of catalytic \nmolecularly imprinted polymers,[35] where a polymer system, based on methacrylic acid \n(MAA) as functional monomer and divinylbenzene (DVB) as cross-linker, was designed to \ncatalyse the Diels-Alder reaction shown in Figure 1. The template used in this study was \nadapted from the transition state analogue developed by Gouverneur et al.[5] in the \nproduction of catalytic antibodies for this [4+2] cycloaddition. While successfully enhancing \nthe rate of the reaction up to 20-fold compared to the solution reaction at room temperature, it \n 5 \nwas noted, however, that at elevated temperature the polymers were shown to lower the rate \nof the reaction instead. Here further insights into this phenomenon have been obtained \nthrough a combination of studies using polymers synthesised using an alternative cross-\nlinking agent, and including one additional temperature step in the evaluation, while keeping \nthe same functional monomer and template, granting direct comparability to the results \npresented previously. Moreover, a series of molecular dynamics studies was conducted, \nproviding insight into which interactions are of importance for template, as well as \nrationalizing the effect of the change in cross-linker.  \nNHO\nO + N\nO\nNHO\nO +\nO\nN\nNHO\nO\nO\nN\nendo\n1 2 3 4\nexo  \nFigure 1. The Diels-Alder reaction studied in ref [35] and this article. \n \nMaterials and Methods \nGeneral. \nReagents were purchased from Aldrich (Germany). Inhibitors from ethylene glycol \ndimethacrylate (EGMA) were removed by extraction with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution. \nThe EGMA was subsequently dried over magnesium sulfate and stored at 4 \u00b0C. Treatment of \nother substances prior to their use is described in ref [35].  \n \nSynthesis of Diels-Alder products and TSAs \nThe endo- and exo-transition state analogues (5 and 6) were synthesized in six steps with an \noverall yield of 35 and 11 %, respectively, as summarized in Figure 2. A detailed description \nof the synthesis can be found in ref [35]. \n 6 \n \n \nFigure 2. Synthesis of the endo- (5) and exo- (6) transition state analogues (TSAs).  \n \nPolymer synthesis. \nPolymers were prepared, as previously described for DVB-based polymers,[35] using \n0.0933 g (0.284 mmol, 5 mol%) TSA (5\/6), 0.0979 g (1.14 mmol; 20 mol%) MAA, and \n0.921 g (4.55 mmol, 80 mol%) EGMA for the synthesis of 1 g polymer. Polymerization was \nperformed in 2 mL toluene, with ACHN (1 mol% relative to double bonds) as initiator. To \nremove the template and additional fines, Soxhlet extraction was carried out in acetone. More \ncomplete template removal from the polymer was achieved by packing the polymer into a \nstainless steel HPLC column and subjecting it to extensive washing under a variety of \nconditions, as described elsewhere.[36] Control polymers were prepared in the same manner \nbut in the absence of template. \n \nBatch binding studies. \nA solution of 5 or 6 in toluene (0.5 mL; 0.1 and 1 mM, respectively) was shaken with \n5 \u00b1 0.1 mg polymer overnight. The polymer was filtered off and the concentration of the TSA \nremaining in solution determined by HPLC performed on a HP1050 or a HP1090 system \nusing a Beckman silica column (250 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm i.d.). Polymer suspensions were filtered \n 7 \nthrough 2 \u00b5m PTFE membrane filter cartridges prior to HPLC analysis. Elution was carried \nout in 90 % heptane containing 0.1 % acetic acid and 10 % isopropanol at a flow rate of 1 \nmL\/min with UV detection at 220 nm. \n \nSwelling studies. \nPolymer (1 mL) was weighed into a 5 mL glass cylinder, and 3 mL of toluene were added. \nThe cylinder was sealed with a glass stopper and left standing for 12 h. The increase in \npolymer volume (swelling, SW), was recorded and the specific swelling (SWsp) calculated \naccording to equation 1. \n\u20ac \nSWsp =\nSW\nm   (1) \n \nKinetics studies. \nA solution was prepared containing benzyl 1,3-butadienylcarbamate (1, 20 mM), \nN,N-dimethyl acrylamide (20 mM) and BHT (5 mg\/10 mL solution) in toluene. Portions \n(3 mL) of this solution were added to pressure tubes containing 100 mg polymer (no polymer \nin case of the solvent reaction). The tubes were purged with nitrogen and heated to the \nrespective temperature (120, 40, and 20 \u00b0C) using an oil bath. At appropriate intervals \nreaction was stalled by cooling on ice and samples of 1 mL were taken. The samples were \ncentrifuged for 5 min (10 000 rcf, 20 \u00b0C), the supernatant filtered, and HPLC analyses \nperformed in duplicate to determine the amount of product formed. Elution was carried out \nwith heptane containing 0.1 % acetic acid and 15% isopropanol at a flow rate of 1 mL\/min \nwith UV detection at 210 nm. Afterwards, the polymer was re-suspended, the mixture \nreturned to the pressure tube, the tube was purged with nitrogen, sealed and heating was \nresumed. Studies using inhibitor were performed accordingly. \n \n                                                \n1 In ref. [29] the corresponding formula is wrongly written with density d instead of mass m. Results, however, \nare correct. \n 8 \nMolecular dynamics simulations \nAll calculations were performed using the AMBER10[37] program package. Studies of the \nprepolymerization mixture were set up and conducted as has been described by Karlsson et \nal.[38]. Models of the respective prepolymerization mixtures were set up containing 20 \nmolecules of the respective TSA, 80 molecules of MAA, 320 molecules representing the \ncross-linker (divinylbenzene was modelled as a 1:1 mixture between para- and meta-isomer), \n1320 toluene molecules and 4 molecules of ACHN. Simulations were run for 20 ns at 310 K \nusing a 9.0 \u00c5 cut-off for non-bonded interactions. \n 9 \n \n \nResults  \nThe subject of this study is the influence of an imprinted polymer system with EGMA as \ncross-linker at different temperatures on the Diels-Alder reaction shown in Figure 1. This \nreaction has been the subject of a recent study in which structures 5 and 6 (Figure 2) were \nused as transition state analogues in the preparation of imprinted polymers based on DVB as \ncross-linker \n \nMolecular dynamics simulations \nIn order to gain better understanding of the differences and similarities of the interactions \nbetween template and functional monomer in the presence of different cross-linkers, \nmolecular dynamics simulations were performed, modelling the pre-polymerization mixture \nover a timeframe of 20 ns. The simulations were analysed in terms of densities of the MAA \nprotons relative to the template molecules in order to identify which sites of the template are \nmost relevant for interactions with the functional monomer (Figure 3). From the \nrepresentations of the density grids it becomes obvious that there are two main interaction \nsites at the template for the formation of hydrogen bonds involving the MAA proton, namely \nthe oxygen atom of the amide group and the doubly bound oxygen atom of the carbamate \ngroup. Significant differences between the spatial arrangements relative to the different \ndiastereomers are, however, not observed. \n 10 \n \n (a) endo-TSA, DVB as cross-linker   (b) exo-TSA, DVB as cross-linker \n (c) endo-TSA, EGMA as cross-linker   (d) exo-TSA, EGMA as cross-linker \nFigure 3.

For the hydrogen bond to the amide oxygen atom no such clear trend is to be found. \nIn case of the endo-TSA the occupancy is only lowered slightly in the presence of EGMA as \ncross-linker as compared to the system with DVB as cross-linker. However, in case of the \nexo-TSA the occupancy is lowered by more than half. In both cases these changes are \naccompanied by similar relative changes in the occupancy of the hydrogen bond between the \ncarbamate proton of the template and the doubly bond oxygen atom of MAA. This can safely \nbe assumed to be due to the close proximity of the two groups in the structure of the TSA (cf. \nFigure 3), leading to a cooperative effect. This cooperative effect can also be the background \nto the rather large difference in occupancy of these two hydrogen bonds of the different TSA \nstructures in the presence of EGMA. In case of the exo-TSA the much lower binding to MAA \nis contrasted by a higher occupancy of the hydrogen bond between the carbamate proton and \none of the doubly bound oxygen atoms of EGMA. For these two occupancies the difference \nbetween the systems is similar (but differently signed), thus, the total binding of the \ncarbamate proton is similar in all studied systems. In the systems with EGMA as cross-linker \nthe proton binds in part to the EGMA, which \u2013 due to the cooperative effect \u2013 also lowers the \nbinding of MAA protons to the amide oxygen atom. The difference in the relative distribution \n 12 \nof the bonds of the carbamate proton is assumedly due to differences in the randomized \nstarting geometries favouring one of the two similar binding modes over the other. \n \nPolymer synthesis and evaluation \nImprinted polymers were prepared with a composition of 20 mol% functional monomer \n(methacrylic acid, MAA) and 80 mol% cross-linker (ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, EGMA) \nin the presence of 5 mol% equivalents template (either endo- (5) or exo- (6) TSA). Thus, the \npolymers have the same molar composition as those used in our previous study. Physical and \nelemental characterisation of the obtained polymers is to be found in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Elemental composition and physical analysis of polymers. \nPolymer code TSA \n \nSpecific \nswelling \n[ml g-1] \nSurface \narea \n[m2 g-1] \nAnal.

While the larger surface \narea could lead to the expectation of higher non-specific binding, the higher specific binding \nshows that this effect is more than balanced by the formation of additional specific binding \nsites. Selectivity for the template utilized in its preparation could, however, only be observed \nfor P(EGMA)ENDO. \n \nAssay \nIn order to investigate the catalytic properties of the polymers, i.e. P(EGMA), the reaction \nbetween diene (1) and N,N-dimethylacrylamide (2) in toluene was performed in the presence \nof each of the different polymers prepared. The formation of the products was monitored by \nHPLC. \n \nWhen the reaction was carried out at room temperature the imprinted polymers increased the \nrate of formation of the endo-product approximately 6-fold, while the non-imprinted polymer \ngave a 4.5-fold increase as compared to the solvent reaction (Figure 4). As for the exo-\nproduct, a significant increase in its formation could not be observed as concentrations remain \nbelow the detection limit. However, diastereoselectivity of the catalysis could not be \nobserved, i.e. there is no observable difference in endo-product formation between the \npolymers imprinted with endo- and exo-TSAs. This, in turn, is in agreement with the results \nobtained from the batch binding studies where no significant diastereoselectivity of binding of \nthe TSAs was observed.  \n \n 14 \n 0\n 0.05\n 0.1\n 0.15\n 0.2\n 0.25\n 0  100  200  300  400  500  600  700  800  900\nc\n [\nm\nM\n]\nt [h]\nsolvent [endo]\nPREF [endo]\nPENDO [endo]\nPEXO [endo]\n \nFigure 4.

At this temperature the formation of the endo-product is \nup to 9.5 times faster in presence of polymer than in its absence (Figure 6). Remarkably, the \ndifference between imprinted and non-imprinted polymers is far less distinguished in this \nstudy than at room temperature. This is especially true for the formation of exo-product, \nwhere there is (with respect to experimental error) no difference to be found between the \ndifferent polymers\u2019 performance. Nonetheless, a 2-fold enhancement of reaction rate can be \nobserved. \n 0\n 0.1\n 0.2\n 0.3\n 0.4\n 0.5\n 0.6\n 0  50  100  150  200\nc\n [\nm\nM\n]\nt [h]\nsolvent [endo]\nPREF [endo]\nPENDO [endo]\nPEXO [endo]\n 0\n 0.01\n 0.02\n 0.03\n 0.04\n 0.05\n 0  50  100  150  200\nc\n [\nm\nM\n]\nt [h]\nsolvent [exo]\nPREF [exo]\nPENDO [exo]\nPEXO [exo]\n \nFigure 6. Formation of 3 and 4 in the presence of PREF, PENDO, and PEXO and solvent only in toluene at \n40 \u00b0C. \n \nAnother reaction assay was performed at room temperature in presence of 20 mM endo-TSA \n(5) as inhibitor. The result of this experiment was essentially the same as for the DVB-based \npolymers in our previously published study[35], i.e. the reaction rate was reduced by \napproximately 30% compared to the non-inhibited reaction. \n \nDiscussion \nInfluence of cross-linker \nThe first interesting finding in this study is the specific binding of template to the imprinted \npolymers, which is substantially higher for each of the EGMA polymer systems than for the \ncomparable DVB-based polymers. This is especially to be highlighted as it is despite a larger \nsurface area, which could be expected to lead to a larger extent of non-specific binding. \n 16 \n \nInterestingly the higher specific binding observed in the batch binding studies does not lead to \nhigher reaction rates. Even though a fundamental enhancement of the rate of product \nformation is observed at room temperature, the DVB-based polymers featured a more \npronounced effect. Furthermore, the relative effect of inhibitor is similar for both systems, \nwhich implies similar ratios between the number of reactions taking place on the polymer \nsurface and inside binding sites. \n \nIn the results of the molecular dynamics studies it can be seen that the interactions between \nMAA and the template are similar in the presence of both cross-linkers \u2013 the strength of the \ndifferent interactions in terms of lifetime is essentially identical. In the case of EGMA as \ncross-linker, however, there is competition between the template and EGMA as acceptors of \nhydrogen bonds from MAA on one hand, and between MAA and EGMA as acceptors of \nhydrogen bonds from the TSA on the other hand. The larger diversity of interactions with the \ntemplate in the system containing EGMA can easily explain the higher total binding observed \nas compared to the system containing DVB. Simultaneously, the higher specific binding \nobserved for the EGMA system can be explained by the competitive binding of the different \nfunctionalities of functional monomer and cross-linker, leading to a situation in which \nfunctional groups that otherwise could lead to non-specific binding are involved in \ninteractions between MAA and EGMA. \n \nA common characteristic of the two different polymer systems is the lack of \ndiastereoselectivity in terms of product formed in their presence. The fact that the choice of \ncross-linker does not have an impact on diastereoselectivity supports our previously made \nargument that the placement of a single double bond within the template structure is not \nsufficient to induce selective recognition. Nonetheless, the employment of EGMA-based \n 17 \npolymers allowed for observation of exo-product formation in the presence of polymer. The \nformation over time parallels that of the endo-product \u2013 at a significantly lower rate. \n \nInfluence of temperature \nInterestingly, the unprecedented temperature dependent behaviour of polymer activity, \nreported in our previous study[35], could be reproduced in spite of the fundamental change in \nthe polymers\u2019 composition (the cross-linker makes up 80 mol% of the reaction mixture). Even \nthough the effect is less pronounced than for the DVB-based polymer, a considerable decline \nin reaction rate compared to the solution reaction could be observed at 120 \u00b0C. \nHowever, due to the lesser extent of the effect, a more detailed analysis is possible. Amongst \nothers, it can be observed that the rate of formation of the endo-product initially (t < 20 h) is \nslightly higher in the presence of imprinted polymers than in solvent or with the reference \npolymer. This indicates that the polymers, even at 120 \u00b0C, have some catalytic activity from \nthe start which then, under the course of the experiment, is lost. This supports our theory that \nadditional reactions of substrates and\/or product of the Diels-Alder reaction with the polymer \noccur, blocking the specific binding sites and obstructing further reactions with its surface. \nAnother finding is that the activity of the imprinted polymers at longer reaction times \nbecomes lower than that of the reference polymers. This could be explained by sites having \nhigh catalytic activity being also more reactive towards the inhibiting reaction, resulting in a \nstronger decrease for the imprinted polymers than for the non-imprinted.  \n \nA higher reactivity of the specific binding sites towards the side reaction is also supported by \nthe data obtained at 40 \u00b0C. While the reaction rate is \u2013 as expected \u2013 much higher than at \nroom temperature, the differences between the imprinted and reference polymers are much \nless distinct. This suggests a diminished effect of the specific binding sites, which in turn can \nbe explained by the integrity of the binding sites being destroyed by side reactions, while on \nthe polymer surface higher temperatures are required in order for this process to take place. \n 18 \n \nBoth the fact, that the unusual temperature dependent behaviour is more distinct for the \npolymer systems showing higher catalytic activity (i.e. the DVB-based polymers), and that \nthe effect is more distinct for the imprinted than non-imprinted polymers, suggests that the \nprocess diminishing the polymers\u2019 catalytic activity is similar to the catalysed reaction itself, \ne.g. a reaction of substrates and\/or product with residual double bonds in the polymer.  \n  \n 19 \nConclusions \nIn this study a series of molecularly imprinted polymers was designed with the help of \nanalogues for two possible transition states of the Diels-Alder reaction of 1 and 2. The \npolymers show specific binding of the template employed in their synthesis and significant \ncatalytic activity for the reaction studied.  \n \nImportantly, at high temperature (120 \u00b0C) significantly less product was formed in the \npresence of polymer than in its absence. This is analogous to a temperature-dependent \nbehaviour that \u2013 by our group \u2013 only recently was reported for the first time for another \nimprinted polymer system. Furthermore, in this study we investigated the temperature \ndependence of the polymer\u2019s performance in more detail by performing the reaction assay at \nan additional temperature. The additional information obtained from this new polymer system \nnot only supports our provisional theory that at higher temperature the polymer participates in \nthe reaction, it also suggests that this reaction preferentially takes places within the \ncatalytically active sites. \n \nFinally, the equilibria in the pre-polymerization mixtures were studied by means of molecular \ndynamics simulations. The results illustrate the importance of different interactions of the \ntemplate with functional monomer and cross-linker molecules, as well as interactions between \nfunctional monomer and cross-linker. Insights from these simulations were successfully \napplied to explain the different properties of the different polymer systems. This demonstrates \nonce again the importance of the processes taking place in the pre-polymerization mixture for \nthe imprinting process and ultimately for the performance of the resulting polymer.  \n \n \n 20 \nAcknowledgements. \nWe gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Swedish Research Council (VR), the \nSwedish Knowledge Foundation (KKS), Graninge Foundation and the Linn\u00e6us University. \nWe are indebted to Dr Sacha Legrand and Dr Jesper G.
