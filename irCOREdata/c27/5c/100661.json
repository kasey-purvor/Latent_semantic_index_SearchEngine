A common technique to produce highly\nelectrically active p-type junctions is to preamorphize the\nsurface region with a relatively high mass ion, typically Ge,\nand then implant low energy B into the amorphous region.\nDuring subsequent annealing, solid phase epitaxial regrowth\n\u0001SPER\u0002, transforms this region back to its original crystalline\nstructure, with the B incorporated substitutionally at concen-\ntrations well above its equilibrium solid solubility limit.1\nHowever, excess Si interstitials remaining just beyond the\noriginal amorphous\/crystalline \u0001a \/c\u0002 interface position con-\ndense into clusters which then evolve by Ostwald ripening2\ninto extended defects known as the end-of-range \u0001EOR\u0002 de-\nfect band. During annealing, Si interstitials are released from\nthe EOR defect band. Their coupling with B leads to tran-\nsient enhanced diffusion \u0001TED\u0002 and boron-interstitial cluster\n\u0001BIC\u0002 formation, leading to increased junction depth and re-\nduced dopant electrical activation,3,4 respectively. One prom-\nising way to overcome these problems is to reduce the cou-\npling between interstitials and B atoms by annealing for a\nshort time at high temperature.5 The ultimate way in which\nto do this is to anneal with a submelt laser.6 This approach\nhas been proven in practice to reduce EOR defect density\nand TED.7 In this letter, submelt laser annealing is employed\nin a different approach where EOR defect behavior during\nlaser and further annealing is investigated when the position\nof the a \/c interface is adjusted with respect to a B implant.\nThree n-type \u0001100\u0002 Czochralski-silicon wafers were\npreamorphized with 2 or 5 keV Ge+ to a dose of 5\n\u00021014 cm\u22122, or 10 keV Ge+, to a dose of 1\u00021015 cm\u22122 pro-\nducing surface amorphous layer thicknesses of 7, 14, and\n22 nm, respectively, \u0001measured by Rutherford backscattering\nspectroscopy8\u0002. B was subsequently implanted into these\namorphous layers at a fixed energy and dose of 500 eV and\n2\u00021015 cm\u22122, respectively, with 0\u00b0 tilt and twist. A millisec-\nond annealing was performed on the wafers, using a scan-\nning diode laser with the surface reaching a peak temperature\nof 1150 \u00b0C. Three strips were annealed across each wafer;\neach receiving either one, five or ten laser scans. All amor-\nphous layers regrew by SPER during the initial laser scan.\nThe kinetic Monte Carlo implant simulator KING9 was used\nto identify Ge energies and doses that would position the a \/c\ninterface in three alternative depths: well beyond the ex-\npected depth of the B implant profile, close to the profile, and\nwithin the peak of the boron profile. These successively shal-\nlower depths correspond to an increase in B concentration in\nthe EOR region from below 1018 to \u00036\u00021020 cm\u22123 as sub-\nsequently measured by secondary ion mass spectroscopy\n\u0001SIMS\u0002. The simulated net excess of Si interstitials beyond\nthe a \/c interface was found to be independent of the implant\ncondition within \u00035%. Van der Pauw and Hall Effect mea-\nsurements were used to measure the sheet resistance \u0001Rs\u0002 and\nthe electrically active B fraction and mobility were extracted\nassuming a Hall scattering factor of unity.\nThe effect of the laser annealing step is examined ini-\ntially. Figure 1\u0001a\u0002 shows the electrically active dose of B as a\nfunction of Ge energy \u0001EOR position\u0002 and number of laser\nscans. Comparing the values for the three Ge Pre-\nAmorphizing Implant \u0001PAI\u0002 energies, one can see significant\ndifference in electrical activation after one laser scan. At\n10 keV, where the EOR damage would be furthest away\nfrom the surface and in the region of lowest B concentration,\nthe B implant has the highest initial active dose of \u00034.9\n\u00021014 cm\u22122. A similar value, 4.6\u00021014 cm\u22122, is obtaineda\u0002Electronic mail: j.sharp@surrey.ac.uk.\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 92, 082109 \u00012008\u0002\n0003-6951\/2008\/92\u00028\u0001\/082109\/3\/$23.00 \u00a9 2008 American Institute of Physics92, 082109-1\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

As the number of laser scans is increased to\nfive and then ten scans, it can be seen that the electrical\nactivation in each Ge PAI sample trends toward the same\nvalue.\nAs the situation after one laser scan shows a substantial\nvariation compared to five and ten laser scans, this one-scan\ncase is focused on. Figure 2\u0001a\u0002 shows B diffusion for this\ncase, measured by SIMS. A Cameca Wf SC-ULTRA tool was\nused, running a 500 eV O2+ primary beam at a 68\u00b0 angle of\nincidence, with oxygen leak. Stage rotation was used to pre-\nvent ripple formation.10 Corresponding sheet resistance val-\nues for each PAI condition are included for reference. Since\nthe as-implanted B profiles for the different Ge PAI condi-\ntions show negligible differences in terms of depth and dis-\ntribution, only one as-implanted profile is shown. The 2 keV\nGe PAI sample shows virtually no diffusion after one laser\nscan combined with the highest Rs, however, the 5 and\n10 keV Ge PAI samples show a more appreciable diffusion\nand much lower Rs. The lowest Rs is found in the 10 keV\nsample, together with evidence of \u201cconcentration-enhanced\ndiffusion\u201d indicating a higher level of substitutional B in the\ndeeper part of the B profile peak. In the 5 keV Ge PAI\nsample, where the tail of the B profile overlaps the EOR\nregion, it is possible to see, indirectly, a degree of B trapping\nat a depth of \u000316 nm.11 The respective Hall mobilities are\n21.9, 19.9, and 21.4 cm2 \/V s for the 10, 5, and 2 keV Ge\nPAI samples, respectively, which show that the trend in Rs is\ndriven by changes in B electrical activation.\nTurning now to the situation after ten laser scans, where\nthe electrical properties for the different PAI conditions have\nconverged to almost the same values, it can be seen that the\ndiffusion in the 2 keV sample is much less than in the 5 or\n10 keV samples, resulting in a shallower junction depth \u0004Fig.\n2\u0001b\u0002\u0005.\nThe thermal stability of activated junctions can indi-\nrectly reveal the presence of EOR defects through a large\namount of B deactivation during postactivation annealing.4\nTo investigate this, a 60 s isochronal annealing schedule\nfrom 600 to 900 \u00b0C with a 50 \u00b0C \/s heating ramp rate was\ncarried out to examine the deactivation of the B after one\nlaser scan and is shown in Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002. When the postlaser\nrapid thermal annealing temperature is increased to 800 \u00b0C\nthe electrically active dose drops significantly, consistent\nwith BIC formation.4 This deactivation is greatest in the\n10 keV sample, but the consistently lower electrical activa-\ntion in the 2 keV sample at up to 700 \u00b0C shows that a\ngreater fraction of B is clustered than in the other two\nconditions.\nIn order to clarify the defect density after laser anneal-\ning, transmission electron microscopy \u0001TEM\u0002 was used to\nexamine the EOR defects; the results are illustrated in Fig. 3.\nImages were taken in weak beam dark field conditions using\nB= \u0004113\u0005 with g= \u0006422\u0007 to increase defect contrast \u0001visibility\nimprovement\u0002 and the number of visible defect variants \u0001in-\ncreased apparent density\u0002.12 After laser annealing with one\nscan, large densities of silicon interstitial clusters are ob-\nserved in the 5 and 10 keV \u0004Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002\u0005 samples, which rep-\nresents a potential source of interstitials which accounts for\nthe considerable deactivation during subsequent annealing.\nHowever, for the 2 keV sample, where the B activation and\ndiffusion were minimal, Fig. 3\u0001c\u0002 shows that very few TEM-\nvisible defects have formed. This reduction in EOR forma-\ntion is thought to be due to a combination of two effects.\n\u0001i\u0002 The concentration gradient of Si interstitials between\nthe EOR defect band and the surface will be higher\ndue to the proximity of the surface.3\n\u0001ii\u0002 As the excess interstitials overlap strongly with the\nas-implanted B profile, the EOR defects that are\nformed may consist of BICs rather than predomi-\nnantly self-interstitial defects.\nFollowing the line of thought in \u0001ii\u0002, it is worth noting that\nBICs are much more stable than self-interstitial defects of\ncomparable size and, as a result, they act as a temporary sink\nfor interstitials, while at the same time there is less driving\nforce for them to ripen into TEM-visible defects. This inter-\npretation agrees with an earlier study by Haynes et al.13 who\nshowed that the density of \u0001TEM-visible\u0002 EOR defects re-\nduced during annealing in the presence of B and that BICs\nFIG. 1.

Another consequence of the sink-\ning of interstitials during BIC formation would be a reduc-\ntion in boron diffusion, consistent with the data in Fig. 2.\nAfter laser annealing with ten scans, there is a drastic de-\ncrease in the number of defects in the 5 and 10 keV samples\nand in the 10 keV case \u0004Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002\u0005 some dislocation loops\nhave formed. In contrast, there are no visible defects in the\n2 keV sample after ten laser scans \u0004Fig. 3\u0001d\u0002\u0005.\nTo summarize, the effect of the position of the a \/c in-\nterface with respect to the surface and boron concentration\non EOR defect formation has been studied after nonmelt\nlaser and prolonged annealing. A combination of mecha-\nnisms appears to be acting to eliminate TEM-visible EOR\ndefects and prevent significant diffusion and deactivation of\nthe ultrashallow B implant. When the a \/c interface and,\nhence, EOR defect band are positioned close to the silicon\nsurface within a high concentration of boron, EOR defect\nformation during a laser annealing of one scan at 1150 \u00b0C is\nmodulated by the increased proximity of the surface which\ncan be considered as an interstitial sink and by the preferen-\ntial formation of BICs rather than predominantly self-\ninterstitial EOR defects. Furthermore, after ten scans the\n2 keV condition has the lowest defect density, least amount\nof diffusion, and the location of the BIC-rich EOR band is\nwithin the peak of the B profile, thus, avoiding potential\nissues with junction leakage while not having any significant\neffect on mobility. This promises to be a viable method of\nforming stable, highly active, ultrashallow junctions.\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the U.K. Engi-\nneering and Physical Sciences Research Council and the Sur-\nrey Ion Beam Centre for their support.
