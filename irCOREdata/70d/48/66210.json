Recent theory\nholds that as the number of organizations using a particu-\nlar external identity code first increases beyond a critical\nminimal level, the code becomes an organizational form.\nGoing beyond this formulation, we theorize about how an\nexternal identity code is established. We argue that when\nthe identities of individual organizations are perceptually\nfocused, they will more readily cohere into a distinct col-\nlective identity. We develop ideas about how two observ-\nable aspects of organizations might generate perceptually\nfocused identities in a common market: (1) de novo entry\nand (2) agglomeration in a geographic place with a relat-\ned identity. Using comprehensive data from the market\nfor disk drive arrays, we test these ideas and an alterna-\ntive by estimating effects of different specifications of\norganizational and product densities on rates of entry and\nexit for array producers. Overall, the analysis supports\nthe notion that firms with perceptually focused identities\naid in establishing an organizational form.\u2022\nIn 1986, a little-known Dutch company named Twincom intro-\nduced a software product designed to manage \u201cdisk drive\narrays,\u201d which are data storage subsystems linking several\n(or many) hard disk drives. In the following year, disk array\nproducts were introduced by an additional seven companies:\n1776, Atlantic Microsystems, Core International, Ford\/Hig-\ngins, Maximum Strategy, Thinking Machines, and Micropolis,\na disk drive manufacturer. Little over a decade later, disk\narrays had a well-established world market and were widely\nused: over $12.6 billion in disk array products were sold in\n1998 by 130 different producers. In a very different domain,\nnamely beer, another new market was developing around the\nsame time. In 1977, the New Albion Brewing Company\nopened in Sonoma, California. It joined the existing (but\nrecently transformed) Anchor Brewing Company of San Fran-\ncisco in offering heavier, full-flavored malt beverages (e.g.,\nales, porters, stouts) not found in the American market for\nbeer. In subsequent years, others followed; by 2000, the eco-\nnomic contribution of mainly small \u201ccraft\u201d breweries was\nestimated at $11 billion. The market includes scores of pro-\nducers such as Anchor, commonly known as \u201cmicrobrew-\neries,\u201d as well as hundreds of other producers known as\n\u201cbrewpubs.\u201d The brewpub also makes full-flavored malt bev-\nerages using craft techniques but serves them at the site of\nproduction, usually in conjunction with food. Founded in 1987\nin Hopland, California, the Hopland Brewery is widely recog-\nnized as the first brewpub in the U.S. since Prohibition.\nChances are that the microbrewery and brewpub terms will\nbe familiar, while the disk array producer term (or anything\nsimilar that would describe specifically the firms in this mar-\nket) will not be. Chances are also that it would not take much\nthought to name a microbrewery or brewpub, but it would\ntake some research to name a disk array producer other than\none of those listed above. The comparison thus raises two\nquestions. First, does it matter that in the one market we\nhave readily accessible descriptive labels to classify and dis-\ntinguish participating firms while in the other we do not? Sec-\nond, presuming it does matter, how can we account for the\n\u00a9 2003 by Johnson Graduate School,\nCornell University.\n0001-8392\/03\/4801-0060\/$3.00.\n\u2022\nThis research was conducted as a project\nof the Information Storage Industry Cen-\nter, University of California at San Diego.\nWe appreciate the research support of\nthe Alfred P.

Carroll\nStanford University\nOlga M.

In our view, the ready accessibility of\nclassificatory terms for types of organization derives directly\nfrom whether or not a particular type of organization consti-\ntutes an organizational form, defined as a recognizable pat-\ntern of activity that takes on rule-like standing, which P\u00f3los,\nHannan, and Carroll (2002) called a code. The term code here\ndenotes and connotes both cognitive recognition and impera-\ntive standing. By this definition, a form is an external identity\ncode, meaning that it is the perceptions and opinions of \u201cout-\nsiders\u201d that matter. The external identity code possesses\nrule-like status, so that its observable violation is negatively\nsanctioned\u2014it causes outsiders to drop discontinuously their\nvaluation of the entity to which it is applied.\nOur concept of organizational form implies legitimation or\nsocial-taken-for-grantedness, sometimes called constitutive\nlegitimation. Much contemporary organizational theory treats\nlegitimation as both privileging and constraining. An organiza-\ntion possessing a legitimated organizational form appears\nunproblematic and can be interacted with and regulated\nunambiguously; accordingly, it typically benefits from greater\naccess to resources, more protection from authorities, and\nhigher visibility\u2014all provided that the organization does not\nviolate any of the form-specific rules constraining its appear-\nance and behavior (Meyer and Rowan, 1977; Zuckerman,\n1999). We view establishment of legitimation as a process in\nwhich positive returns potentially increase from the first\nappearance of a potential organizational form up to a subse-\nquent ceiling, signaling the organizational form\u2019s establish-\nment. These positive returns of the form-establishment\nprocess involve ease of organizing, resulting in higher rates\nof organizational founding and enhanced life chances for the\norganizations using the potential form.\nAccepting our answer to the first question means that the\nsecond question actually asks, When and where will a new\norganizational form emerge? In an exploratory case study of\nthe disk array market, McKendrick and Carroll (2001) exam-\nined arguments drawn from organizational theory and juxta-\nposed them with basic facts of the situation. They found that\nthe disk array organizational form had not developed, despite\nthe presence of formal institutions representing collective\naction and ecological processes often associated with form\nemergence. They speculated that the reason the form had\nnot crystallized lies in organizational diversity: the heteroge-\nneous set of origin industries spawning and still supporting\ndisk array producers (i.e., continuing to provide the bulk of\nmany firms\u2019 revenue) makes it difficult for the disk array pro-\nducer organizational form to gain perceptual recognition and\ntake hold. The difficulty arises because form establishment is\nessentially about identity formation: if many firms in the mar-\nket derive their primary identities from other activities and\nthere are few firms deriving their primary identity from disk\narrays, then the disk array producer identity will likely not be\nreadily perceived by outsiders, thus impeding its coherence\ninto a code or form.\n61\/ASQ, March 2003\nDisk Array Producers\n#9917\u2014ASQ V48 N1\u2014March 2003\u2014file: 03-mckendrick\nMcKendrick and Carroll\u2019s (2001) case materials suggest a\nreformulated specification, which we develop below, of the\ndensity-dependent process commonly thought to generate a\nlegitimated organizational form. More precisely, an organiza-\ntional form likely emanates from the density of producers\nwith perceptually focused identities in a market, rather than\nthe total density number typically used by ecologists, and the\nperceptions of outsiders will be more focused when the iden-\ntities arise from (1) de novo entrants and (2) entrants that are\nconcentrated in geographic locations that possess related\nidentities. We used firm-level event-history data collected for\nevery producer to enter the market for disk arrays worldwide,\nfrom Twincom\u2019s initial introduction to the end of 1998, to test\nthese arguments in analyses of organizational entry and exit.\nPRIOR THEORY AND RESEARCH ON FORMS\nIn her review of the literature on the evolution of new organi-\nzational forms, Romanelli (1991: 81) claimed that \u201cno theoret-\nical consensus exists regarding an approach to the problem\u201d\nof how new forms emerge and become established and that\n\u201cthe conceptual approaches are diverging.\u201d More tellingly,\nRomanelli also found no generally accepted common defini-\ntion of the organizational form concept. She determined that\nfrom the many theoretical arguments about form emergence\nthat had been proposed, \u201cno overarching themes for integrat-\ning these perspectives\u201d could be identified (Romanelli, 1991:\n100). Romanelli concluded on a positive note: she advised\norganizational theorists to embrace the conceptual diversity\nabout forms, to emphasize differences among various con-\nceptualizations, and to illustrate the quality of various defini-\ntions through theoretically directed empirical research.\nIn the period since Romanelli\u2019s (1991) review, usage of the\norganizational form concept has probably become even more\nelastic. As Romanelli (1991: 81\u201382) noted, at the broadest\nlevel, \u201cthe concept of organizational form refers to those\ncharacteristics of an organization that identify it as a distinct\nentity and, at the same time, classify it as a member of a\ngroup of similar organizations,\u201d yet many proposed defini-\ntions are so highly abstract they lack empirical bite. For\nexample, in his pioneering book on organizational classifica-\ntion, McKelvey (1982: 107) first defined form as \u201ca concept\nto broadly capture the character of an organization\u2019s struc-\nture, function and process.\u201d He then later redefined it as\n\u201cthat which is measured by taxonomic characters\u201d and sug-\ngested that \u201cthe best strategy for selecting taxonomic char-\nacters is to measure everything possible\u201d with an emphasis\non \u201ccharacters associated with dominant competence and\nevolutionary\/ecological importance\u201d (McKelvey, 1982: 214).\nThe most common type of definition uses specific features\nof organizations to identify and define organizational forms\n(Carroll and Hannan, 2000; P\u00f3los, Hannan, and Carroll, 2002).\nThis approach emanates from Weber\u2019s (1968) analysis of the\nrational-legal bureaucracy, which he defined in terms of fea-\ntures such as authority, procedures, and the employment\nrelation of the official. The feature-based conception of form\nhas developed to recognize that some features\u2014so-called\n\u201ccore\u201d features\u2014are more important than others in distin-\n62\/ASQ, March 2003\n#9917\u2014ASQ V48 N1\u2014March 2003\u2014file: 03-mckendrick\nguishing forms (Scott, 1998). Organizations with the same\ncore features belong to the same form, by this view.\nA second popular definition of organizational form is based on\nthe presumption that distinctions among forms reflect social\nprocesses and boundary creation (DiMaggio, 1986; Hannan\nand Freeman, 1989). In this view, the clarity and strength of\nsocial boundaries define forms\u2014sharper boundaries generate\nclearer forms. The key to understanding forms, then, involves\nlooking at the processes that create and maintain boundaries,\nincluding social networks, technological change, closed flows\nof personnel among a set of organizations, changes in pat-\nterns of resource flows, and the like.\nIn the view of P\u00f3los and colleagues (P\u00f3los et al., 1998; P\u00f3los,\nHannan, and Carroll, 2002), both types of definitions of form\nsuffer from limitations, the most serious of which is the lack\nof connection between forms and identities (see also Ruef,\n1999; Zuckerman and Kim, 2003). In their view, the form\nclassification rules of organizations should not be divorced\nfrom the social world, because classifying forms involves\nsocial and cultural typifications\u2014widely agreed-upon classifi-\ncations of entities into types (Meyer and Rowan, 1977; Scott,\n1995). Empirical research on such processes suggests that\nthey build on organizational identities (Zuckerman, 1999,\n2000; Ruef, 2000).\nForm as Identity\nThe research reported here followed Romanelli\u2019s (1991) sug-\ngestion to demonstrate the value of specific definitions of\nform through empirical research rather than try to incorporate\nmany meanings into a single analysis. Accordingly, in asking\nhow and when organizational forms emerge, we followed\nP\u00f3los, Hannan, and Carroll (2002) in defining an organizational\nform as a recognizable social code that possesses rule-like\nstanding and therefore denotes and connotes both cognitive\nrecognition and imperative standing. So, a code can be\nunderstood as (1) a set of interpretative signals, as in the\n\u201cgenetic code,\u201d and (2) as a set of rules of conduct, as in the\n\u201cpenal code.\u201d In P\u00f3los, Hannan, and Carroll\u2019s (2002) formula-\ntion, the key identity code for an organizational form is exter-\nnal. There are potentially an infinite number of forms, but\nonly activities that acquire external recognition and are con-\nstrained by the sanctions of outsiders gain form status; forms\ndo not exist independent of external agents. Identity codes\nfor organizational forms typically consist of abstract features\nas well as composition rules about appropriate combinations\nof particular features.\nA form identity applies to multiple organizations and persists\nover time. This is because once established, a form identity\ngets embedded in other societal institutions, such as lan-\nguages, directories, and public labels. For example, the yel-\nlow pages of the phone book give a very basic set of organi-\nzational forms for many, but not all, of the entries. For form\nidentities in more technical markets, such as that for disk\narrays, one might look at how technical and buyer-oriented\npublications place firms into groupings, how companies refer\nto themselves and their products in advertisements and\nother public announcements, and how gatekeepers to critical\n63\/ASQ, March 2003\nDisk Array Producers\n#9917\u2014ASQ V48 N1\u2014March 2003\u2014file: 03-mckendrick\nresources such as capital and labor categorize firms. Many of\nthe classifications built into these sources reflect the implicit\nrules about forms used by external gatekeepers to organize,\nevaluate, and sanction individual organizations.\nForm Emergence\nAlthough a particular set of organizational features might\ndevelop an external identity, this does not mean that the\nidentity has become an organizational form, unless it has also\nbeen enforced and taken for granted by outsiders, i.e., the\nidentity must be codified, socially embedded, and sanctioned.\nAn implication of this construction is that it \u201callows us to\ndefine populations that never achieve form status and to\nextend meaningfully the definitions of populations back to\nthe period of early legitimation\u201d (P\u00f3los, Hannan, and Carroll,\n2002: 107). Thus, populations can be defined not by forms,\nas received ecological theory does, but instead by identities,\nthe most specific and minimal external identities applicable.\nP\u00f3los, Hannan, and Carroll (2002) have theorized about when\na specific nascent external identity will become an organiza-\ntional form. They linked the form-generation process to\nprevalence, or organizational density, and specified a form-\nspecific application number, \u03bd(\u03c6), that marks the number of\norganizations to which a social identity must apply for the\nidentity to gain organizational form status. That is, identities\nbecome forms at varying points in populations\u2019 histories,\ndepending on \u03bd(\u03c6) and their density levels. Moreover, the\nform-specific number \u03bd(\u03c6) represents the density N\u03c6at which\nthe legitimation-enhancing returns of new organizat\u0131ons join-\ning the population reach a ceiling. This means that \u201cthe peri-\nod in a population\u2019s history between its inception and the\ntime at which density surpasses \u03bd(\u03c6) is the crucial period of\nlegitimation in the sense of taken-for-grantedness\u201d (P\u00f3los,\nHannan, and Carroll, 2002: 107).\nApplying this idea to a potential new form identity might be\nstraightforward: from inception, one can count the number of\norganizations N holding the minimal identity at various peri-\nods t and then look during each period for other phenomena\ntypically associated with a legitimated organizational form.\nThe point at which these phenomena are first seen should\ncoincide roughly with N(t) = N\u03c6 = \u03bd(\u03c6). Following this strategy,\nMcKendrick and Carroll (2001) found that the number of disk\narray producers entering the market rose steadily over the\nearly years, eventually slowing down and stabilizing and,\nfinally, declining slightly. From received ecological theory,\nwhich holds that legitimation of a population increases with\ndensity at a decreasing rate and approaches a ceiling at high\nlevels of density (Carroll and Hannan, 2000: 222\u2013228), it\nwould thus be plausible to reason that the disk array identity\nbecame a form at least before the time and the density level\nof the population stabilized. Other compelling information\nmade it clear, however, that the identity had yet to develop\ninto a form, thus leading McKendrick and Carroll (2001) to\nconclude that the theory was deficient. For example,\nalthough the industry information service provider Disk\/Trend\nclassified disk arrays as a single industry, we know from\nextensive interviews with executives and others that this\n64\/ASQ, March 2003\n#9917\u2014ASQ V48 N1\u2014March 2003\u2014file: 03-mckendrick\nclassification category was only one of several ways partici-\npants and outsiders perceived the market, even in the period\nafter organizational density had stabilized. Other relevant out-\nsiders, such as security firms\u2019 market analysts, seldom\nfocused on a disk array (or similarly termed) industry, prefer-\nring instead to stay at the more encompassing level of \u201cdata\nstorage\u201d (see Hambrecht and Quist, 1998; Tucker Anthony,\n1998). Moreover, these analysts\u2019 reports usually did not con-\ntain subgroupings based on the disk array form or organiza-\ntional type; instead, they described individual companies and\ntheir particular technologies or product lines (e.g., video or\naudio streaming, transaction processing, web caching). A\nsimilar lack of consensus about appropriate form was evident\namong market insiders. So, for instance, companies referred\nto themselves variously as involved in \u201cstorage,\u201d \u201cstorage\nsubsystems,\u201d \u201cRAID (Redundant Array of Independent\nDisks),\u201d \u201cdisk arrays,\u201d \u201cnetwork attached storage,\u201d and\nother categories. As the director of product marketing at\nMaximum Strategy said, \u201cCompanies are starting to go away\nfrom saying [disk arrays], and are instead talking about what\nthey offer. We provide high bandwidth\u201d (Electronic Engineer-\ning Times, 1996: 47). One prominent company even went so\nfar as to publish a book attempting to clarify the many con-\nfusing terms in the industry (Network Appliance, 2002).\nFigure 1 provides some data about this identity ambiguity\nfrom searches we conducted in LexisNexis on the various\nidentity labels. For each year from 1985 to 2000, we\nsearched the full texts of all business and finance articles in\nthe business category of LexisNexis to count the number of\ntimes a particular identity label was used. Figure 1 shows\ntwo plots: one gives the count for articles that used the word\nstrings \u201cdisk array\u201d and \u201ccompany\u201d at the same time, while\nthe other gives the counts for uses of the exact word string\n\u201cdata storage company.\u201d Usages of both terms rose in the\nperiod, suggesting possible identity formation, but while the\ndisk array usage was more common in the early years, it was\n65\/ASQ, March 2003\nDisk Array Producers\n#9917\u2014ASQ V48 N1\u2014March 2003\u2014file: 03-mckendrick\nFigure 1.

This suggested to us that the disk array form\nwas likely not yet fully established and that the identities\nremained in flux.\nPerceptually Focused Identities\nMcKendrick and Carroll\u2019s (2001) case study led us to pursue a\ndifferent argument and specification of the form-emergence\nprocess, taking into account the perceptions of external agents\n(such as financial analysts, bankers, suppliers, distributors,\npotential employees, and customers), because it is through\nthese agents\u2019 perceptions and sanctions that form identities\nemerge and persist. It is not clear, however, when and how\nthese external actors perceive that a set of organizations with\nwhich they potentially interact possesses a new identity that\nshould be subject to some sanctioning. We propose that such\na perception occurs when the identities of the individual orga-\nnizations in a population somehow become focused on at least\nsome of their common components. This means that the per-\nceptions of external actors are directed to some salient com-\nmon features of a set of organizations and that there is some,\nperhaps implicit, recognition of this commonality as a distinc-\ntive social entity (the identity or nascent form). Perceptually\nfocused identities are important for a variety of mutually rein-\nforcing reasons. First, focused identities mean that both insid-\ners and outsiders will be more likely to recognize and identify\nsomething distinctive. So, focus increases salience. Second,\nthe greater homogeneity of organizations with focused identi-\nties implies that form boundaries and exclusion rules are sim-\npler. Simpler boundary rules make policing or sanctioning pos-\nsible (Zuckerman, 1999). Third, salience and homogeneity\nprovide the seedbed for generating solidarity and organizing for\nself-promotion and defense (Buechler, 2000).\nIf these speculations are valid, then they lead to a reformulat-\ned specification of the density-dependent form-generation\nprocess advanced by P\u00f3los, Hannan, and Carroll (2002). We\nretain the core idea that identity of a form derives from the\naggregated identities of individual organizations; we also\nretain the form-specific application number \u03bd(\u03c6) for achieving\nform status. But rather than base this number on density per\nse, we base it on the number of organizations with perceptu-\nally focused identities, NP\u03c6. Now an organizational form\nemanates from initial rises (when density is low) in the densi-\nty of producers with perceptually focused identities in a par-\nticular market rather than from initial rises in total density. In\nother words, form \u03c6 emerges at time t when \nNP(t) = NP\u03c6 = \u03bd(\u03c6), \nwhich can be stated as a proposition:\nTheoretical proposition: Establishment of an organizational form is\npositively related to initial rises (when density is low) in the density\nof organizations with perceptually focused identities.\nOf course, in a newly developing market, the products of par-\nticipating organizations may also be highly visible. When\nsome organizations produce multiple products, this possibility\n66\/ASQ, March 2003\n#9917\u2014ASQ V48 N1\u2014March 2003\u2014file: 03-mckendrick\nraises the question of whether collective identities are built\naround products or organizations. The case for organizations\ncomes from their multidimensional nature: identity springs\nfrom their joint presence in labor, product, and financial mar-\nkets, among others (Baron, 2002). Products develop identities\nin more restricted arenas, but these may be very large from\nthe perspective of individuals and reflect heavily on the under-\nlying producer organization. Indeed, individuals\u2019 perceptions of\nparticular organizations likely spring from experiences with\nproducts, not only in use but through advertisements, demon-\nstrations at trade shows, press releases, and the like. If so,\nthen organizational form identities might emerge from the\nnumber (density) of products promulgated by producer organi-\nzations. This possibility suggests an alternative proposition:\nAlternative theoretical proposition: Establishment of an organiza-\ntional form is positively related to initial rises (when density is low)\nin the density of products associated with a particular activity.\nEmpirical Hypotheses\nFor empirical research, an advantage of the theoretical propo-\nsition is that it can be readily incorporated into extant models\nof density-dependent legitimation. As explained above, NP\u03c6\nrepresents the density level at which an identity acquires the\ncharacter of a form, meaning that it is fully legitimated or\ntaken for granted. Before this point, as NP(t) grows from 0 to\nNP\u03c6, the taken-for-grantedness of the identity increases by at\nleast two mechanisms (Hannan and Carroll, 1992: 41): (1)\n\u201ccollective action by members of the population to define,\nexplain and codify its [potential] organizational form and to\ndefend itself from claims and attacks of rival populations\u201d\nand (2) \u201ccollective learning by which effective routines and\nsocial structures become collectively fine-tuned, codified and\npromulgated.\u201d Ecologists claim that the strength of both\nmechanisms tracks organizational density; and substantial\nempirical research on a variety of populations shows that as\ndensity rises from early low levels, organizational founding\nrates increase and mortality rates fall, exactly as increasing\nlegitimation would lead one to expect (Carroll and Hannan,\n2000). Accordingly, a similar empirical test of the theoretical\nproposition would consist of relating NP(t) to the vital rates of\nan emergent organizational population.\nFully specifying a model for empirical testing requires further\nconceptual elaboration, namely, linking the perceptually\nfocused identity concept with measurable characteristics of\norganizations to calculate NP(t). Many sophisticated instru-\nments or methods can be designed to measure focus in\norganizational identity, but a number of these would be\nimpossible to apply to nonexisting, previously failed organiza-\ntions. To overcome this obstacle, we prefer in this initial\nexploration to use readily identifiable, observable organiza-\ntional characteristics that can be ascertained systematically\nfrom the historical record, which also facilitates comparative\nanalysis (Carroll and Hannan, 2000). One observable charac-\nteristic is an organization\u2019s status upon entry into a market.\nMcKendrick and Carroll (2001) conjectured that the disk array\nproducer organizational form did not fully take hold in the\n67\/ASQ, March 2003\nDisk Array Producers\n#9917\u2014ASQ V48 N1\u2014March 2003\u2014file: 03-mckendrick\nobserved early phase of the market because disk array pro-\nducers came from a heterogeneous set of origin industries\nand often retained operations in those industries, perhaps\nstill deriving the bulk of their revenue therein. In their view,\nthe problem resided in the externally perceived basis of\nfirms\u2019 identities: so long as firms in the disk array market\nderived their primary identities from other activities and few\nfirms derived their primary identity from disk arrays, then the\ndisk array producer identity seemed unlikely to be perceived\nby outsiders. That is, the high levels of organizational diversi-\nty and diversification made it unlikely that the common disk\narray features would cohere into a code or form of its own;\nthe external perceptions of identities were not focused in this\ncontext.\nDe novo entry. McKendrick and Carroll (2001) used these\ngeneral arguments to claim that in the disk array market, de\nnovo firms possessed greater focus than de alio firms that\ncame into the market from a wide variety of other activities in\nwhich they often remained active. This means that initially\u2014\nwhen density is low\u2014a density count of de novo firms\nshould show legitimation-enhancing effects on the whole set\nof producers. In this sense, focus is about perception: focus\nhelps outsiders see and legitimate the activity, not improve\nthe life chances of de novo firms themselves. That is, we set\nNP(t) to record de novo producers and hypothesize:\nHypothesis 1a (H1a): Organizational founding rates of all organiza-\ntions engaged in a particular production activity will rise with initial\nincreases (when density is low) in the density of de novo producers\nengaged in the same activity.\nHypothesis 1b (H1b): Organizational mortality rates of all organiza-\ntions engaged in a particular production activity will decline with ini-\ntial increases (when density is low) in the density of de novo pro-\nducers engaged in the same activity.\nThis formulation is also more consistent with the market\u2019s\noverall empirical trends. Specifically, McKendrick and Carroll\n(2001) showed that, unlike total density, the annual density of\nde novo disk array producers did not rise to a stable point\nand then subside. Rather, de novo density appeared to be\nstill in a growth phase. More importantly, because it did not\nlevel off and was still rising upward, the trajectory of de novo\ndensity did not give the general impression that the identity\nhad been legitimated. It suggested, instead, that the identity\nwas undergoing institutionalization and may not yet have\nbeen fully legitimated.\nAlthough this formulation appears theoretically sound and\nempirically consistent with the facts of the disk array case, it\ncontradicts one drawn from another popular perspective on\nlegitimation. The so-called sociopolitical view of legitimation\nholds that endorsement by powerful actors yields advantages\nto organizational forms and aids in the process of legitimation\n(Scott, 1995). It follows logically then that if and when larger\nestablished (powerful) organizations enter a market, then\nlegitimation should be enhanced. IBM\u2019s entry into the person-\nal computer market is a well-known case that seems consis-\ntent with this argument. In terms of organizational density by\n68\/ASQ, March 2003\n#9917\u2014ASQ V48 N1\u2014March 2003\u2014file: 03-mckendrick\nentry mode, the prediction most consistent with this view\nwould be that de alio density contributes the greatest to\nlegitimation because de alio entrants are usually larger and\nmore powerful than de novo entrants. There is an extensive\nprior literature about the effects of de novo\/de alio status on\nfirm mortality and failure rates (see Carroll et al., 1996, for a\npartial review), and a general finding is that de alio firms\nexperience lower mortality rates, especially in their early\nyears. This suggests, too, that de alio firms are stronger com-\npetitors. The theory developed here, however, concerns the\neffects of densities of de novo and de alio organizations on a\nfocal organization, not the de novo or de alio status of the\nfocal firm, which is the subject of almost all prior research.\nSo, the prior literature on de novo and de alio entry is only\nsuggestive at best in terms of the legitimation of identities.\nThe intuition behind hypotheses 1a and 1b comes from per-\nceptual considerations based on viewing organizations in a\nfocal market as whole social entities. The assumption is that\nexternal actors see or know about aspects of the participat-\ning organizations that transcend the focal market. From this\nperception, the common component of focal market partici-\npation (i.e., the potential new form) is more likely to domi-\nnate when more organizations operate mainly in the focal\nmarket, as de novo entrants do. By contrast, diversified firms\nmay interact with external agents in ways that do not height-\nen perceptions of the focal market. For example, the financial\nreports of publicly traded firms may not highlight some of the\nsmaller new markets in which the firms are engaged.\nAgglomeration in a geographical place with a related\nidentity. Another potential contributor to perceptually\nfocused identities arises from considerations based on out-\nsiders\u2019 views of those organizations most frequently encoun-\ntered socially. If one\u2019s high-frequency interaction partners\ninclude many organizations with the potential new organiza-\ntional form, then one is more likely to recognize (at least\nimplicitly) and sanction the form. A second-order network\neffect may also occur: one\u2019s perception of a possible form is\nheightened when many of one\u2019s interaction partners interact\nwith organizations possessing the common properties. Dis-\ncerning the interaction patterns of external agents with\nrespect to organizations and each other is extremely difficult,\nthough, especially those occurring in the distant past. A plau-\nsible alternative is to compare the effects of organizations\ngrouped by various geographic locations, in particular, those\nlocations with high numbers of firms in the focal market and\nwith place identities recognized by the market\u2019s participants\nand external agents. Compared with other locations, these\nplaces are likely to have identities related to the new activity,\nthereby providing more focus to outsiders\u2019 perceptions.\nGeographers and other scholars of regions and regionalism\ncommonly view localities as socially defined perceptual units\nthat only exist in relation to particular criteria (Allen, Massey,\nand Cochrane, 1998; MacLeod, 2001). Although places have\na real physical environment and a spatial dimension, they are\nnot defined by a precise geographic boundary. Rather, they\nbecome known with regard to different spheres of social\naction and so may have multiple identities: political, cultural,\n69\/ASQ, March 2003\nDisk Array Producers\n#9917\u2014ASQ V48 N1\u2014March 2003\u2014file: 03-mckendrick\nsocial, and economic. In this regard, they are a medium for\nsocial interaction, and their identities are socially constructed.\nAs Paasi (1996: 8) put it, \u201cindividual actors and collectivities\nare socialized as members of specific territorially bounded\nspatial entities and .|.|. more or less actively internalize territo-\nrial identities and shared traditions.\u201d The very naming of\nplaces helps to construct their identities, connecting their\nimages with the perceptions of insiders and outsiders. Acad-\nemics, journalists, regional protagonists, business executives,\nand politicians use language to popularize, establish, and sus-\ntain places in the consciousness of society (Carr, 1986; Paasi,\n1996; MacLeod, 2001). A place explicitly comes into being\nand acquires an identity through these discourses (Pred,\n1989).\nThe place identities of interest here relate to the industrial\nworld. Social scientists have long noted that firms in the\nsame market often agglomerate (Marshall, 1920; Weber,\n1929; Hoover, 1948). By agglomerating, firms increase their\ninteractions with each other and make collective action more\nlikely. Agglomeration also often produces a common percep-\ntion among participants and outsiders that something with an\nidentity resides therein. A local culture emerges that defines\nor unifies organizational actors through a mutual awareness\nof their common industrial purpose (Storper, 1995). This\ncoherence consists of a similar spirit of enterprise, organiza-\ntional practices, action rules, customs, understandings, and\nvalues (Saxenian, 1994). Indeed, in describing particular\nagglomerations, analysts typically use language strongly sug-\ngesting that organizations derive public cognitive recognition\nfrom clustering with similar others; this is especially true for\nthose who have written about Italian \u201cindustrial districts\u201d\n(Brusco, 1982; Piore and Sabel, 1984; Becattini, 1990). Of\ncourse, many geographical places possess socio-economic\nidentities. The sheer number of organizations and employees\nin a related activity can make them a coherent identifiable\norganizational community. But our sense is that prevalence in\nitself does not contribute to the emergence of an organiza-\ntional form. Rather, a form often exists before a place\nbecomes identified with it. For example, although Dalton,\nGeorgia, is typically seen as the world\u2019s carpet manufacturing\ncenter, carpet making already existed as a form before Dalton\nacquired that identity.\nA strong place identity can override firm differences to con-\ntribute to form emergence in two general ways. One is if the\ngeographic area is a known place with a preexisting social\nidentity of its own. For instance, Silicon Valley and Route 128,\nwhich feature prominently in the market for disk arrays, are\nknown for their excellence across several technological mar-\nkets. Organizations in these milieux have a collective identity\nas \u201ctechnology firms,\u201d thereby signaling to external actors\nthat they are members of a community known for the cre-\nation of new firms, technologies, and markets. The second\nway, related to the first, is if the place has a preexisting iden-\ntity related to or closely associated with activities in the new\nmarket. For instance, such a place may have had a reputation\nas a center of data storage, and so this identity would confer\ngreater visibility on the disk array firms located there. Forms\n70\/ASQ, March 2003\n#9917\u2014ASQ V48 N1\u2014March 2003\u2014file: 03-mckendrick\nseem more likely to emerge out of locales with preexisting\nrelated place identities because external agents already asso-\nciate these places with similar kinds of activities, thereby giv-\ning the new activity greater perceptual focus. So, when firms\nin a particular new market agglomerate in places with related\nsocial identities, they should be more likely to generate a\ncoherent identity of their own and thus an organizational\nform. This argument sets NP(t) to track the density of geo-\ngraphically agglomerated producers in a place with a related\nidentity, which leads to the following hypotheses:\nHypothesis 2a (H2a): Organizational founding rates of all organiza-\ntions engaged in a particular production activity will rise with initial\nincreases (when density is low) in the density of geographically\nagglomerated producers in a place with an identity related to the\nsame activity.\nHypothesis 2b (H2b): Organizational mortality rates of all organiza-\ntions engaged in a particular production activity will decline with ini-\ntial increases (when density is low) in the density of geographically\nagglomerated producers in a place with an identity related to the\nsame activity.\nOur formulation relates to other recent work in organizational\necology that has also advanced theoretical ideas about geo-\ngraphic boundaries and legitimation. Both Hannan et al.\n(1995) and Bigelow et al. (1997) argued that social legitima-\ntion of a form operates on a broader geographic scale than\ncompetition because political and physical barriers are more\nlikely to interrupt the exchange of goods and people than\nthey are ideas or cultural images. This argument led to a mul-\ntilevel specification of density dependence, with density for\nlegitimation counted across geographic boundaries and for\ncompetition counted only within boundaries (Bigelow et al.,\n1997; Hannan, 1997). Although hypotheses 2a and 2b may at\nfirst blush appear at odds with these claims, there are at\nleast two reasons why they need not be. First, Hannan et\nal.\u2019s (1995) theory can be seen as concerning the legitimation\nwithin a newly emergent population of a form previously\nestablished in another context (a type of diffusion), while the\ncurrent hypotheses address the initial emergence of an orga-\nnizational form in any population. Second, Hannan et al.\u2019s\n(1995) argument involved claims about the exchange of infor-\nmation across (and thus the interdependence of) various geo-\ngraphic units, which are essentially about where to draw the\npopulation boundaries rather than how to count density once\nthe boundaries are determined. In any event, neither poten-\ntial complication pertains to this study, given that it is about a\npotentially new form in a single worldwide population.\nCombined effects. The two perceptually driven processes\nhypothesized above may operate jointly. When de novo pro-\nducers possess focused identities and congregate in a partic-\nular geographic area with a related place identity, the two\nprocesses should combine to speed up legitimation (an inter-\naction effect) even faster than their individual effects,\nbecause the two processes operate in different ways. De\nnovo density represents a process of simple accretion in col-\nlective identity: each member possesses (virtually) the same\nidentity, and as more members enter the market, the identity\n71\/ASQ, March 2003\nDisk Array Producers\n#9917\u2014ASQ V48 N1\u2014March 2003\u2014file: 03-mckendrick\ngains force by sheer numbers. By contrast, the agglomera-\ntion process involves muting many other aspects of firm\nidentity and causes attention to cohere around the common\ndimension. Although different, the two processes do not\nwork in opposition. So, interacting regularly with many orga-\nnizations possessing the same apparent features should\naccelerate identity formation and legitimation of a potential\norganizational form initially when density is low. These argu-\nments lead to the following hypotheses:\nHypothesis 3a (H3a): Organizational founding rates of all organiza-\ntions engaged in a particular production activity will rise with initial\nincreases (when density is low) in the density of geographically\nagglomerated de novo producers in a place with an identity related\nto the same activity.\nHypothesis 3b (H3b): Organizational mortality rates of all organiza-\ntions engaged in a particular production activity will decline with ini-\ntial increases (when density is low) in the density of geographically\nagglomerated de novo producers in a place with an identity related\nto the same activity.\nProduct densities. Finally, we need to consider the alterna-\ntive theoretical proposition based on product density rather\nthan organizational density. It is rather straightforward to\ndevelop a basic pair of hypotheses linking product density to\nform establishment:\nAlternative hypothesis 1a (Alt. H1a): Organizational founding rates\nof all organizations engaged in a particular production activity will\nrise with initial increases (when density is low) in the density of\nproducts associated with the same activity.\nAlternative hypothesis 1b (Alt. H1b): Organizational mortality rates\nof all organizations engaged in a particular production activity will\ndecline with initial increases (when density is low) in the density of\nproducts associated with the same activity.\nBrief Background on Disk Arrays\nThe main technical components of a disk array are (1) a set\nof disk drives; (2) configuration of the drives into some kind\nof interdependent system; (3) the interconnect protocols in\nthe system; (4) the storage controller; and (5) the system\ncache architecture. The business of disk arrays appears even\nmore complicated because arrays are sold with varying\ndegrees of completeness (Disk\/Trend, 1999). A number of\ncompanies sell subsystems (complete arrays ready to use),\nbut product groups also include boards (array controllers,\npower supplies, and other components without disk drives)\nand software (an individual software product providing array\nfunctionality). Thus, companies may specialize in boards or\nsoftware, or they may provide complete systems. Companies\nmay also be independent providers or captive producers mak-\ning arrays for their own computer systems. Pinning down the\nexact first appearance of disk array technology is difficult.\nThe technology originates in the idea of redundant, or fail-\nsafe, computing when on-line transaction processing began\nto emerge in the 1960s, and multiple disk drives were bun-\ndled with computer systems for which they were specifically\ndesigned. Yet companies were slow to offer fail-safe disk\n72\/ASQ, March 2003\n#9917\u2014ASQ V48 N1\u2014March 2003\u2014file: 03-mckendrick\nstorage products that worked with a variety of computers,\nmaking a market for disk drive arrays slow to develop (see\nMcKendrick and Carroll, 2001, for a fuller account of the\nhistory).\nThe market for disk arrays is segmented in a number of\nways, and firms differ in the scope of their offerings. Arrays\nare sold in four identifiable primary markets: the computer\nmainframe array market (e.g., computer reservation sys-\ntems), the network\/midrange multiuser market (the bulk of\nthe disk array market), the single-user market, and the spe-\ncialized high performance market (e.g., video servers, geo-\nphysical exploration data analysis). A disk array can have as\nfew as two disk drives or as many as 200, though most\narrays contain fewer than 100 drives.\nDuring 1998, 134 companies offered array subsystems,\nboards, or software at one time or another, but three firms\u2014\nIBM, EMC, and Compaq Computer\u2014held almost three-quar-\nters of the total market (Disk\/Trend, 1999). Led by IBM and\nCompaq, captive sales accounted for almost two-thirds of\nindustry revenue. EMC was the largest independent supplier,\naccounting for more than half of non-captive sales, followed\nby Data General and Hitachi Data Systems. U.S. firms held\n90 percent of the market.\nMETHODS\nWe used archival data on the disk array market to identify the\ncomplete set of firms that has ever offered a product on this\nmarket at any time. In testing the hypotheses, we used infor-\nmation on the times of market participation to estimate rate\nmodels of organizational founding and mortality. The indepen-\ndent variables consisted of time-varying measures of the\nnumber of organizations in the market (density) by entry\nmode (de novo\/de alio), the number of products on the mar-\nket (product density), and several important geographically\nbased density counts from places with a related identity (the\nBoston Area, the San Francisco Bay Area, and California). We\nalso included a number of time-varying control variables in\nthe models to help rule out alternative interpretations. These\nincluded firm tenure in the market, public\/private company\nstatus, number of products, product submarkets, product dis-\ntribution channels, firm size, membership in an industry asso-\nciation, venture capital recipient, population age at entry, den-\nsity, density at founding, venture capital funding of industry,\ndensity of industry association, and industry revenue. We\ndescribe below sources and metrics of the variables.\nData Sources on Disk Array Producers\nThe data analyzed here covered the complete set of disk\narray producers serving the market worldwide, dating from\nthe Twincom product in 1986 through the end of 1998, the\nlast year of full coverage from the most comprehensive\nsource of data available. The data came primarily from\nDisk\/Trend, Inc. Disk\/Trend published annual reports on disk\ndrive arrays, as well as other kinds of storage. The first\nDisk\/Trend report on arrays was published in 1993. The\nreports covered every company that made complete subsys-\ntems, boards, or software specifically intended to permit disk\n73\/ASQ, March 2003\nDisk Array Producers\n#9917\u2014ASQ V48 N1\u2014March 2003\u2014file: 03-mckendrick\ndrives to operate as an array. The reports also listed specifi-\ncations for each product a company shipped and the date of\nits first shipment.\nIn addition, we compiled event histories through extensive\nlibrary and online searches for each company identified by\nDisk\/Trend as an array manufacturer, which also turned up a\nfew companies that made disk drive arrays prior to the publi-\ncation of Disk\/Trend. In some cases, the event histories\nrevealed shipment dates that preceded those listed in\nDisk\/Trend and provided more accurate dates for entry into\nand exit from the array market.\nEntry and exit of array producers. A firm\u2019s first date of\nproduct shipment signified its entry into the array market. It\nwas more difficult to determine organizational mortality or\nending events, however, than entry. For organizational mortal-\nity or ending events, the most important distinctions concern\n(1) disbanding of the firm, (2) exit to another industry, and (3)\nmerger or acquisition by another firm. The meaning of dis-\nbanding is unambiguous: the firm failed as a collective actor.\nExit to another industry also suggests a lack of success in\narray manufacturing. The merger and acquisition ending\nevents are harder to interpret. Although merger and acquisi-\ntion both result in the loss of one or more organizations,\nfirms merge and are acquired for diverse reasons. Some-\ntimes a firm flounders, and its owners seek to recover some\nfraction of their investment by selling the firm. In other\ncases, a thriving firm\u2019s competencies command great value\nfrom potential acquirers or merger partners (Carroll and Han-\nnan, 2000). Because of the ambiguous meaning of mergers\nand acquisitions, we based our analysis on the disbanding\nand exit to another industry and, consistent with standard\npractice, treated mergers and acquisitions as censored\nobservations.\nWe sometimes did not know exactly what happened to firms\nwhen they dropped from the set of producers; this was often\nthe case when spells of array production were short and\nwhen the scale of production was tiny. Our reading of the\nsource materials and our knowledge of the market suggested\nthat most exits of unknown type were disbandings or exits to\nother industries. So, we treated these two events alike: the\ndependent variable in this analysis was disbanding\/exit to\nanother industry, defined to include events of unknown type.\nFirms known to have ended by other events (merger, acquisi-\ntion) were treated as (non-informatively) censored on the\nright at the times of these events. We identified 258 firms\nthat entered the market. The count began in 1986 and cov-\nered all firms known to offer disk arrays up to and including\neleven new entrants in 1998. Over the short history of the\narray market, there were 114 disbanding\/industry exits and\n14 mergers\/acquisitions.\nFirm-Level Variables\nWe measured a number of firm-level variables. The variable\nthe organizations research literature labels organizational age\nis usually a measure of tenure in a particular organizational\npopulation. For the majority of array producers (212 of the\n258 firms, or 83 percent), we knew the exact annual quarter-\n74\/ASQ, March 2003\n#9917\u2014ASQ V48 N1\u2014March 2003\u2014file: 03-mckendrick\nly date of entry and exit in the array market, based on prod-\nuct shipment. For the minority of array producers without\nquarterly entry and exit dates (17 percent of firms), we knew\nthe year of entry and exit and randomly assigned quarterly\ndates within that year. Tenures in the disk array market were\nthen calculated based on these quarterly entry and exit data.\nFor de novo\/de alio status, we determined from the source\nmaterials whether a firm was a de novo or de alio producer.\nWe used a dummy variable to indicate de novo status. Using\na variety of sources listing public companies, we attempted\nto determine public\/private status by identifying every public\nfirm in our database by year of operation. This dummy vari-\nable took a value of one in the period when a company was\nlisted as publicly traded and zero otherwise. We counted the\nnumber of products for each firm as the number of distinct\nproducts on the disk array market in a given year. We divided\nthe market for disk arrays into four distinct product submar-\nkets and recorded whether a firm sold a product in each of\nthese. The submarkets were single use, mainframe comput-\ner, networks, and high performance. Participation in each\nsubmarket was measured by a dummy variable. We recorded\nwhether the array producer was a captive firm, OEM (original\nequipment manufacturer), or PCM (a plug compatible manu-\nfacturer, reseller, and distributor). Preliminary analysis\nshowed that the effects for OEM and PCM firm-level charac-\nteristics were similar and could be efficiently combined into a\nsingle dummy variable, OEM or PCM, which we report in\nestimates below; captive array producers thus represented\nthe omitted comparison for this dummy variable.\nWe measured firm size as the firm\u2019s annual revenue from its\nsale of arrays. For the major array producers in the market\u2014\ni.e., the top 15 to 25 annual array producers, such as EMC,\nIBM, and DEC, which collectively represented approximately\n90 percent of all annual industry revenue\u2014we had precise\nfirm-specific revenue data from Disk\/Trend. For the few major\nproducers that existed prior to Disk\/Trend\u2019s coverage in 1992,\nwe linearly interpolated backwards the firm-specific revenues\nof their earlier annual spells, using their actual revenue trajec-\ntory post-1992 as the functional form for our imputation. For\nthe smallest and shortest-lived array producers, Disk\/Trend\ndid not publish firm-specific revenue figures, and we were\nunable to find more precise disk array revenue figures for\nthem from other sources. But Disk\/Trend did record the\nannual aggregate revenue of these non-major, smaller array\nproducers based on the distribution channel they used (cap-\ntive, OEM, and PCM) and geographic location (companies\nbased in the United States and those not in the United\nStates). Since we knew which of these six different cate-\ngories Disk\/Trend used to classify smaller array producers,\nwe were able to impute an annual revenue for each smaller\narray producer, based on the average revenue for a firm in\nthat category. In exploratory models, we estimated models\nusing the size variable in log form and did not find any major\nchanges in estimation. Because the log size specification\namplifies differences among small firms and the data for\nthese firms were less reliable, we believed the other specifi-\ncation was preferable.\n75\/ASQ, March 2003\nDisk Array Producers\n#9917\u2014ASQ V48 N1\u2014March 2003\u2014file: 03-mckendrick\nWe constructed a firm-specific time-varying dummy variable\nto indicate whether a firm was a member in the major indus-\ntry association that operated within the disk array industry\nduring the period under study, the RAID Advisory Board (RAB\nmember). To identify which firms received venture capital,\nwe searched the SDC Platinum database constructed by\nThomson Financial Securities Data and a variety of other\nsources listing companies that received venture capital to\nidentify such firms in the disk array market. We used a\ndummy variable to indicate firms that received venture capital\n(venture capital recipient). To take into account population\nage at entry, we constructed a fixed firm-level variable that\nrecorded the age of the organizational population at the time\nof market entry that took the value of one in the first year of\nthe disk array market and then increased in increments annu-\nally. It was intended as a control for possible effects of popu-\nlation aging, including first-mover or order-of-entry advan-\ntages in the disk array market.\nPopulation-level and Other Environmental Variables\nOrganizational density. We used the life-history information\non firms to construct a variety of density counts. These vari-\nables measured the total number of firms of a particular kind\noperating in any given year. In most models below, we used\na time-varying count of basic density, measuring all the firms\nin the market. We also used a time-invariant variable giving\nthe density in the year of market entry for each firm (for justi-\nfication of these specifications, see Carroll and Hannan,\n2000). We used a linear specification of organizational densi-\nty, since it is consistent with our theorizing, and the inclusion\nof a quadratic specification did not substantively affect our\nestimates.\nFocused-identity densities. Tests of the theoretical proposi-\ntion about perceptually focused identities were conducted\nwith several different kinds of NP(t) density counts. First, we\nused the density of de novo firms to test H1a and H1b. We\nthen looked at the effects of several density variables based\non geography to test H2a and H2b. We focused on the three\nlocations where disk array producers agglomerated and there\nwas a sense of place identity operative in the market: the\nBoston Area (Route 128) in Massachusetts, California, and\nthe Bay Area in Northern California, which included mostly\nfirms in \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d and a few firms just north of or\nacross the bay. Finally, we examined the effects of density\ncounts measuring de novo producers within specific geo-\ngraphical areas, e.g., California de novo producers and, finally,\nmost narrowly, the Bay Area de novo producers. These last\ndensity variables were appropriate for testing H3a and H3b.1\nWe used the information on firms\u2019 annual product counts to\nconstruct product densities. These variables measured the\ntotal number of products of a particular kind on the market in\nany given year. In the models below, we used a time-varying\ncount of product density, measuring all the products in the\nmarket. Tests of the alternative theoretical proposition about\nproducts were conducted with several different kinds of\nproduct density counts. First, we used the product density of\nall producer firms to test Alt. H1a and Alt. H1b. We then test-\n1\nA currently popular way to incorporate\nspatial concerns in models of agglomera-\ntion uses the actual geographic distances\nof organizations from each other, some-\ntimes as weighted density variables (see\nSorenson and Audia, 2000; Sorenson and\nStuart, 2001). When theoretical ideas con-\ncern the costs or frictions of spatial dis-\ntance, these measures are superior to\nsimple counts of density within specified\ngeographic areas because they contain\nmore detailed information. The theoretical\nideas here, however, concern the interac-\ntion patterns occurring in places with\nrelated identities themselves; organiza-\ntions either reside in such places or they\ndo not, meaning that the relevant theoret-\nical distinction is categorical in nature.\nHence, we used densities grouped by\ngeographic area in examining the possible\neffects of agglomeration in such places.\n76\/ASQ, March 2003\n#9917\u2014ASQ V48 N1\u2014March 2003\u2014file: 03-mckendrick\ned a refinement of these hypotheses using more narrowly\ndefined counts of product density that might be related to\nproduct visibility and identity: the density of products for the\nnon-captive array market of original equipment manufacturers\nor plug compatible manufacturers, resellers, and distributors.\nWe examined the effects of the percentage of array firms\nthat were members of the RAB on rates of array producer\nentry and exit (percentage of firms in RAB). In exploratory\nanalyses, we used an alternative specification of the quarterly\nor annual density of RAB firms in lieu of the percentage of\nRAB members on rates of entry and exit; both specifications\nyielded virtually identical estimates. We recorded the total\nannual funding of disk array companies by venture capital\nfirms (venture capital array funding) based on the information\nwe obtained from the SDC Platinum database of Thomson\nFinancial Securities Data. For total industry revenue, we used\nDisk\/Trend\u2019s figure of worldwide industry revenue from 1992\nto 1998. For the period 1986 to 1992, prior to the publication\nof Disk\/Trend\u2019s first report on the market, we estimated\nindustry revenue based on an exponential extrapolation from\n1986 up to the exact 1992 industry figure. Our knowledge of\nthe industry gave us a reasonable level of confidence in\nthese early figures.\nStochastic Model and Estimation\nFounding\/entry estimation. Consistent with standard frame-\nworks for estimating rates of organizational entry\/founding\n(see Carroll and Hannan, 2000), we estimated array producer\nentry using event-count models in which the array market\nrepresented the unit at risk of experiencing an event. For this\nreason, entry models estimated the effects of population-\nlevel and environmental variables but not firm-level covari-\nates. The entry models were based on quarterly counts of\narray producers entering the array market. Covariates were\nupdated every quarter, the only exceptions being annual mea-\nsures of industry revenue and venture capital array funding,\nfor which quarterly data were not available.\nTo estimate array entry rates, we explored both Poisson and\nnegative binomial specifications. Exploratory analyses\nrevealed the presence of overdispersion, in which the vari-\nance of the event counts exceeds the mean (see Barron,\n1992; Swaminathan, 1995), suggesting the appropriateness\nof the negative binomial form, which includes a parameter for\noverdispersion. For the negative binomial model, the relation-\nship between the instantaneous rate of entry, \u03bbt, and a set of\nj covariates, Zjt, was specified as:\nln \u0001t = \u0002 + \u0003\nj\n\u0004jZjt + \u03b5t,\nwhere \u0002 is the regression model constant, \u0004j are effects of\ncovariates, and \u03b5t is the error term, which follows a gamma\ndistribution. We estimated negative binomial regressions\nusing the software package STATA.\nExit\/disbanding estimation. We represented variation in\ntenure (u) in the disk array market as a piecewise-exponential\n77\/ASQ, March 2003\nDisk Array Producers\n#9917\u2014ASQ V48 N1\u2014March 2003\u2014file: 03-mckendrick\nfunction with breakpoints for the pieces denoted as 0 \u0001 \u03c41\n\u0001\u03c42 \u0001 .|.|. \u0001 \u03c4p. Assuming that \u03c4p+1 = \u221e, gives P periods: Ip = \n\u0001u | \u03c4p \u0001 u \u0001 \u03c4p+1\u0002, p = 1,.|.|.,P. After examining life tables and\nexploring estimates of a variety of choices of the breakpoints,\nwe decided to break the duration scale (in years) at 2.0 and\n4.0. With this choice, the first segment (0, 2.0] included\ndated events that occurred within the first 24 months in the\nindustry along with cases that entered and exited at\nunknown times within the same year. The second segment\n(2.0, 4.0] included dated events that occurred within the sec-\nond 24 months along with cases that entered at unknown\ntimes in one year and exited at unknown times in the next\nyear. The final segment began at four years and was open on\nthe right.\nWe specified that the instantaneous disbanding\/exit rate \u00b5i\nfor organization i was a function of the following form:\nln\u0005i(u, t) = mp + \u0006Sit +\u0004Nit + \u0003k \u0007kXkit, u \u0003 0, u \u2208 Ip\nwhere tenure is denoted by u, mp denotes a set of tenure-\nspecific effects, Sit denotes organizational size for firm i at\ntime t, Nit denotes organizational density, and the k other\ntime-varying covariates are summarized in Xkit. In basic tests\nof the hypotheses, we estimated models with this general\nform with the method of maximum likelihood as implement-\ned with a user-defined routine in STATA (S\u00f8rensen, 1999).\nEstimation of rate models with time-varying covariates\nrequired the construction of split-spell data whereby\nobserved durations were artificially broken and censored at\nperiodic points when the values of the covariates were\nupdated. For exit models, we updated values every year\nbecause the majority of the independent variables were\nbased on annual, not quarterly, observations. Tables 1 and 2\nprovide descriptive statistics for the variables used in both\nthe entry and exit analyses. A few variables have different\nminimum and maximum values for entry and exit due to the\ndifferent units of time (quarterly versus annual spells, respec-\ntively). Appendix tables A.1 and A.2 provide correlations\namong the key independent variables for entry and exit\nmodels.2\nFINDINGS\nOrganizational Founding\/Entry\nTable 3 reports our first set of founding\/entry rate models for\nworldwide array producers. Model 1 represents a baseline\nmodel with the main controls and array producer density.\nResults in model 2 support H1a, as the density of de novo\narray producers significantly increases entry into the disk\narray market. Model 3 shows that the percentage of firms in\nthe RAB significantly reduces entry, contrary to predictions\nbased on institutional theory, and that the density of products\nhas nonsignificant effects on entry, contrary to Alt. H1a. Mod-\nels 4 and 5 demonstrate the robustness of de novo density in\nincreasing firm entry, even controlling for the percentage of\nfirms in the RAB and the density of all products and those for\nthe OEM\/PCM market.3\n2\nHigh correlation among covariates sug-\ngests potential problems of estimation\ndue to multicollinearity (see Maddala,\n1988; Kennedy, 1992; Greene, 2000).\nEstimates with collinear data do not vio-\nlate the standard assumptions of regres-\nsion and offer unbiased and efficient esti-\nmates (Kennedy, 1992; Greene, 2000).\nEconometrics textbooks suggest that\nmulticollinearity is usually not a problem\nwhen statistically significant support is\nfound with collinear data (Maddala, 1988;\nKennedy, 1992). Since the effects of\nmany of our key explanatory variables\nshow statistical significance (at the level\nof p < .05), we are fairly confident that\nwith our specifications, issues of multi-\ncollinearity do not affect the findings. But\nbecause estimates with collinear data can\nbe sensitive to changes in the number of\nobservations in a sample (Maddala, 1988;\nKennedy, 1992; Greene, 2000), we re-ran\nour entry models, which would be most\nsusceptible to multicollinearity, without\nthe last quarterly observation and found\nlittle change in our original estimates. In\nfact, when there was any change, it\namplified our hypothesized effects. These\nestimates are available upon request.\n3\nDe novo density also had substantive\neffects on firm entry rates. When density\nof de novo firms reached its mean value\nof 12 organizations, the entry rates of\nfirms into the disk array market increased\nby approximately 8 times, suggesting an\n800 percent increase in entry rates due to\nthis variable. In contrast, the predicted\ndensity of de alio firms was not signifi-\ncant and had hardly any effect on firm\nentry rates.\n78\/ASQ, March 2003\n#9917\u2014ASQ V48 N1\u2014March 2003\u2014file: 03-mckendrick\n79\/ASQ, March 2003\nDisk Array Producers\n#9917\u2014ASQ V48 N1\u2014March 2003\u2014file: 03-mckendrick\nTable 1\nDescriptive Statistics for Disk Array Producer Entry\/Founding Models*\nVariable Mean S.D.

Models 6 through 8 show strong sup-\nport for H2a, as the density of each geographic agglomera-\ntion, including Boston, California, and Bay Area firms,\nsignificantly increases entry rates.4 Models 9 through 11 offer\nsome general support for H3a, that geographically agglomer-\nated de novo producers will increase firm entry rates. In\nmodels 10 and 11, the density of California and Bay Area de\nnovo producers, respectively, significantly increases entry\nrates. In model 9, however, the density of de alio firms in\nBoston, and not de novo Boston firms, significantly increases\nentry rates.5\nFigures 2 and 3 plot the predicted significant effects of densi-\nties of geographically agglomerated producers (models 6\nthrough 8) and geographically agglomerated de novo and de\nalio producers (models 9 through 11) on firm entry rates. Fig-\nure 2 shows that firm density in the Boston area has the\nstrongest positive effect on all firm entry, followed by the\nBay Area density and then California density. For example,\nwhen density in the Boston area reaches 10 firms, it increas-\nes entry into the disk array market by about 8 times (an 800\npercent increase). Figure 3 shows that although the density\nof de alio firms in the Boston area significantly increases\nentry rates, this effect is much weaker than the positive\neffects on entry by either the Bay Area de novo firms or Cali-\nfornia de novo firms. The density of Bay Area de novo firms\nshows the most powerful positive effect on entry rates.\n4\nIn these models, the density of firms out-\nside the geographic agglomerations of\nBoston, California, and the Bay Area\nreduced entry rates (for non-California\nfirms, this is statistically significant). We\nbelieve this is due to the substantial geo-\ngraphic dispersion of disk array producers\nacross the United States and the world,\nsuch that 59 percent of all non-Boston\narray producers were outside of Califor-\nnia, and over 88 percent of all non-Califor-\nnia and Bay Area firms were outside of\nBoston. Disk array production occurred in\n24 different states and 12 different for-\neign countries. We found similar results\nwhen we ran models combining Boston\nand California de novo density: the com-\nbined de novo variable significantly\nincreased entry, while the density of firms\noutside of Boston and California reduced\nentry but was not significant.\n5\nThe nonsignificant effects of Boston de\nnovo firms may be related to their small\ndensity (a maximum of one Boston de\nnovo firm in our entry data). The positive\neffects of Boston de alio density on array\nproducer entry rates may be related to\ntheir role in geographic agglomeration:\nthe density of Boston area firms signifi-\ncantly increased array producer entry\nrates, and Boston de alio firms constitut-\ned an overwhelming proportion of Boston\narea firms (on average, 14 times as many\nde alio to de novo firms in Boston). The\nsubstantive effect of Boston de alio den-\nsity in increasing array producer entry\nrates, however, was lower than with all\nother (non-Boston) de novo density\ncounts.\n80\/ASQ, March 2003\n#9917\u2014ASQ V48 N1\u2014March 2003\u2014file: 03-mckendrick\nTable 3\nML Estimates of Negative Binomial Models of Founding\/Entry Rates of Disk Array Producers, 1986 to 1998*\nModel\nVariable .(1) .(2) .(3) .(4) .(5)\nConstant .365 .123 .342 .146 .092\n(.246) (.245) (.246) (.245) (.247)\nIndustry revenue\/1000 (t) \u2013.218\u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2013.307\u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2013.057 \u2013.183\u2022\u2022 \u2013.231\u2022\u2022\u2022\n(.041) (.045) (.079) (.079) (.076)\nVenture capital array funding\/1000 (t) .017\u2022\u2022\u2022 .008 .015\u2022\u2022\u2022 .007 .007\n(.006) (.006) (.006) (.005) (.006)\nDensity of all firms (t-1) .021\u2022\u2022\u2022 .013\n(.003) (.010)\nDensity of de novo firms (t-1) .198\u2022\u2022\u2022 .185\u2022\u2022\u2022 .187\u2022\u2022\u2022\n(.051) (.052) (.055)\nDensity of de alio firms (t-1) \u2013.0001 \u2013.013 .002\n(.007) (.012) (.013)\nPercentage of firms in RAB (t-1) \u201310.5\u2022 \u20137.34 \u20135.16\n(4.66) (4.21) (4.30)\nDensity of products (t-1) .004 .005\n(.004) (.003)\nDensity of products for OEM\/PCM market (t-1) .0007\n(.004)\nDispersion parameter .272 .171 .219 .144 .158\nLog likelihood \u2013118.6 \u2013113.3 \u2013116.2 \u2013111.1 \u2013112.6\nChi square vs. null (constant rate) 38.7 49.1 43.5 53.6 50.6\nD.f. 3 4 5 6 6\n\u2022 p < .05; \u2022\u2022 p <.025; \u2022\u2022\u2022 p <.01.\n* Standard errors are in parentheses; N of observations = 51.\nWhen Bay Area de novo density reaches six firms, the entry\nrate increases 30 times (a 3000 percent increase).\nOrganizational Disbanding\/Exit\nTable 5 presents the results of our first set of array producer\ndisbanding\/exit estimates.

In fact, the\ntrend in the last year or so has been for market analysts, the\ntrade press, and the companies themselves to treat disk\narrays as one element in a storage network, along with soft-\nware, tape drives, switches, and routers. Although disk\narrays underpin these networks, \u201cdata storage\u201d may become\nthe external identity that spawns an organizational form.

Boston de alio firms may\nreduce exit rates because of their disproportionate role in\ngeographic agglomeration, as Boston area density significant-\nly reduces exit rates (model 18). The case of California and\nBay Area de alio firms may simply implicate more complex\ncompetitive dynamics than our present theorizing and model-\ning have captured, although the magnitude of agglomerated\nde alio density effects is substantially smaller than that of\nagglomerated de novo firms. Based on unreported multiplier\nrate calculations, Boston area de novo firms reduce exit rates\n1.4 times more than Boston area de alio firms, California de\nnovo firms reduce exit rates 2.7 times more than California\nde alio firms, and Bay Area de novo firms reduce exit rates\n3.8 times more than Bay Area de alio firms. Figure 4 demon-\nstrates this using firms agglomerated in the Bay Area as an\nexample (based on model 23). It takes three de novo firms\noperating in the Bay Area to reduce exit rates practically to\nzero, whereas about 10 de alio firms operating in the Bay\nArea are required to have the same effect on exit rates.\nwhich impairs organizational form devel-\nopment. We also found similar results\nwhen we ran models combining Boston\nand California de novo density: the com-\nbined de novo variable significantly\nreduced exit rates, while the density of\nfirms outside of Boston and California\nincreased exit but was not significant.\n00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\nFirm Density\nFigure 4.

We\nhave made two claims about perceptually focused identities\nthat empirical analysis supports: (1) the legitimation of an\norganizational form emanates from the number of de novo\nfirms in a market, and (2) a large number of de novo firms\nwithin a geographic agglomeration possessing a related iden-\ntity will accelerate identity formation. This amounted to\nrespecifying the density-dependent process currently thought\nto lead to an organizational form.\nThe findings for the density of de novo firms in disk array\nproduction supported the claim about perceptual focus, since\nin this market de alio firms came from diverse origins and\noften retained significant activities in those areas, while de\nnovo firms tended to focus on disk arrays. All other things\nbeing equal, an identity is more likely to be perceived and\nthus to gel into a recognizable form faster\u2014and at lower lev-\nels of density\u2014when the constituent organizations possess\nsimilar unit identities themselves than when they are hetero-\ngeneous. Such a development might be spurred by both\nintra- and extra-industry processes. Among a set of organiza-\ntions, a common structure means that firms are likely to rely\non common resources of labor, customers, and the like. They\nare also more likely to identify with each other, recognize\ncommon interests, and develop solidarity. Externally, the\ncommon features among de novo firms means that outsiders\ncan more readily see the unit character in the grouping of\nfirms and act accordingly.\nThe findings for agglomeration speak to social science\u2019s\nbroad acceptance of the idea that organizational activity tends\nto be spatially concentrated. Economists, regional scientists,\nindustrial sociologists and economic geographers generally\nagree that economic benefits accrue to firms that cluster\n(Becattini, 1990; Porter, 1990; Krugman, 1991; Storper, 1995;\nHayter, 1997; Sorenson and Stuart, 2001) and that these ben-\nefits\u2014agglomeration effects\u2014increase with the number of\nfirms in the cluster (Arthur, 1986). Agglomerations may\nenhance innovation, improve operational efficiency and stim-\nulate economic growth through information spillovers, labor\nmarket pooling, the availability of specialized suppliers tai-\nlored to the industry, and a spirit of rivalry among competing\nfirms that, in turn, enhances learning (Saxenian, 1991, 1994;\nJaffe, Trajtenberg, and Henderson, 1993; Feldman, 1994;\nHead, Ries, and Swenson, 1995; McKendrick, Doner, and\nHaggard, 2000).\nIn a narrow sense, our findings agree with these positive\nevaluations of agglomeration. But they also suggest, as oth-\ners have argued (Carroll and Wade, 1991; Swaminathan and\nWiedenmayer, 1991; Lomi, 1995), that agglomeration might\nbe a more general factor shaping the evolution of organiza-\ntional populations, in this case, the emergence of an organi-\nzational form. Ecologists have long hinted that the level of\nspatial aggregation implicitly defines population boundaries\n86\/ASQ, March 2003\n#9917\u2014ASQ V48 N1\u2014March 2003\u2014file: 03-mckendrick\nand that organizations\u2019 resource requirements generally have\na geographic basis (Hannan and Freeman, 1989). Our findings\nshow that the level of analysis is indeed an important factor\nin determining how an institutionalized organizational form\nemerges. Despite possible appearances to the contrary, our\nfindings are also largely consistent with the prior theories\nabout legitimation and geography: whereas Hannan et al.\u2019s\n(1995) story about legitimation operating on a broader geo-\ngraphic scale applied to the spread of established organiza-\ntional forms to new populations, the story developed here\nconcerns the initial emergence of a form in any population.\nMoreover, in developing the theoretical arguments, we have\nfurther modified the specification of the density-dependent\nprocess to incorporate particular locations explicitly. If a\npotential disk array form does get perceived and coheres, it\nmay result not only from the number of de novo producers in\na market but also from the number of de novo producers that\nare also geographically clustered in a place with a related\nidentity. The core idea is that the propinquity of de novo firms\nin a place with a related social identity may engender aware-\nness of the potential form and make it more visible and\nsalient to external evaluators. Additionally, the perception that\norganizations derive public cognitive recognition from cluster-\ning can even override to some extent the diffuse identity of\nde alio firms to create a sense of homogeneity and generate\nsolidarity. Although, consistent with our theory, de novo firms\nhad a considerably stronger effect than de alio firms on low-\nering exit rates, our findings suggested that form emergence\nmay be even more strongly related to geographic clustering\nthan we theorized initially. Indeed, a market composed of\ngeographically dispersed organizations may make it difficult\nfor diverse actors to recognize and act on their commonali-\nties; it may also make it harder for outsiders to see and iden-\ntify the form, especially if they are engaged only in captive\nproduction. Moreover, the initial steps of identity generation\nmay be highly localized, but the process spreads quite rapidly\nacross geographic boundaries. In disk arrays, an increase in\nthe number of agglomerated firms in the Bay Area and\nBoston region reduced the exit rates for all firms in the mar-\nket; disk array firms in Taiwan and Europe benefited from the\nlegitimation process in the U.S.\nIn terms of future research, the findings suggest several\navenues. One emerges from a limitation of our study noted\nby one of the reviewers, namely, that we do not examine the\nactions of external agents. Although we used what financial\nanalysts and market participants wrote and said about the\nmarket to develop our theory, we did not systematically\nstudy them. Obviously, attending more carefully to how out-\nsiders classify organizations can bear fruit (Zuckerman 1999,\n2000; Zuckerman and Kim, 2003), as the salient bases of\nidentity are likely to be quite different for different external\naudiences (Philips and Zuckerman, 2001). If codes are\nenforced differently from place to place, researchers might\nneed to tailor their typologies of organizational form to the\nspecific locale and social context under study. Baron (2002)\nspeculated that different kinds of informants are likely to clas-\nsify organizations along dimensions that do not correspond to\n87\/ASQ, March 2003\nDisk Array Producers\n#9917\u2014ASQ V48 N1\u2014March 2003\u2014file: 03-mckendrick\nAllen, J., D.

More systematic analysis of relevant out-\nsiders could contribute to a better understanding of form\nemergence. Human resource officers or recruiters or even\npotential employees, for example, give greater importance\nthan other evaluators to an organization\u2019s labor market identi-\nty (Baron, 2002). Hsu and Podolny (2002) used content analy-\nsis of movie reviews to determine how films and genres can\nbe classified, an approach that could be used to classify firms\nand their identities. There is certainly room for more research\non how external agents perceive organizational identities.\nA second area could focus on the ecological consequences\nof delineating identities based on labor market versus prod-\nuct market considerations (Baron, 2002). In fact, Baron and\nHannan (2001) found evidence that organizations that estab-\nlished a labor market identity prior to a product market identi-\nty were less likely to alter their labor market model over time\nthan were organizations that were product-driven.\nA final point regarding the role played by geography in the\ndevelopment of organizational forms seems important to con-\nsider in future research. Those who study organizations and\ngeography appear to characterize agglomeration, at least\nimplicitly, in two ways. One approach treats agglomerations\nin largely functional terms, as places where close proximity in\ninput-output relations confers economic benefits, such as\neconomies of scale, innovation, and economizing on transac-\ntion costs. A second more sociological view characterizes\nagglomerations as places with social identities of their own,\nindependent of any single market cluster. Are the transaction-\nal qualities of agglomerations or the social identities of place\nmore relevant to form emergence? We cannot answer for\ncertain, as we found evidence that suggests both processes\noperate in the disk array market. In support of the view that\nan agglomeration\u2019s functional attributes may contribute to\nform emergence, for example, was the difference in the\nmagnitude of positive effects on entry rates that appear to\nreflect the physical proximity of geographical clustering: the\nBoston area, with the largest effect, is more compact than\nthe Bay Area, and the Bay Area is a subset of California. But\nwe also found it intriguing that our findings were associated\nwith two locations with strong identities of place, Route 128\nand Silicon Valley. Both places have related identities recog-\nnized by market participants and external agents. Compared\nwith other locations, they likely have denser direct and indi-\nrect interaction patterns with their resident organizations,\nthereby providing more focus to outsiders\u2019 perceptions. But\nwe leave this as speculation and encourage researchers to\naddress each possibility.\nREFERENCES\nBarron, D.
