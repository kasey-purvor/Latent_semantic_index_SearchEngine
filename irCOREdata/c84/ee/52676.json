The emphasis  on  practice  suggests  that  experience,\nwork  place  socialisation  and  tacit  knowledge,  are  essential   components   of   learning   about\nmarketing that often get overlooked in more traditional marketing courses.\nOriginality\/value\nThis paper suggests that much established marketing education does not take sufficient account of\nexperiential based learning and instead, is wedded to a model of teaching  that  sees  marketing  as\nbeing mainly about the transmission of administratively based knowledge. This paper  argues  that\nrelying overly on the latter will not provide tomorrows marketers with an appropriate skill  set  for\nemployment.\nKeywords: action learning, consultancy project, skills, interpretative, marketing \nPaper type: Research \nINTRODUCTION:  THE  MARKETING  SKILLS  DEBATE  AND   AN   AGENDA   FOR\nACTION LEARNING\nThe issue of the state of  marketing  skills  education  and  the  extent  to  which  these  adequately\nprepare students for employment, have been widely discussed not only in  Marketing  Intelligence\nand Planning, but elsewhere as well (Taylor 2003; Brennan and Ankers 2004;  Gray  et.  al.  2007;\nHyman and Hu 2005; Davis et. al. 2002; Hill et. al. 1998). Both Evans  et.  al.  (2002)  and  Lynch\n(2008) argue that marketers need to possess more of well rounded skill set for modern  working,  a\npoint reflected in the research of Martin and  Chapman  (2006).  The  latter  argue  that  traditional\nmarketing courses are too narrow and students,  particularly  if  they  are  going  to  work  in  SME\nmarketing, need a broader skill base. McCole (2004) raises the point that  academia  fails  to  fully\nunderstand how marketing is actually carried out in practice and consequently, large parts of  what\nis  taught  are  inappropriate.  Central  to  the  whole  debate  here  is  the  actual  skills   marketing\ngraduates require and whether or not current educational practices are adequately equipping  them\nto meet the demands of a changing and complex work environment. Cunningham (1999)  suggests\nthat much more emphasis needs to be put on the development of  team  working  and  learning  by\ndoing, rather than on the transmission of abstract, technical knowledge.  Dacko  (2006)  has  noted\nthe  importance  and  relevance  of  the  \u2018how  to  skills\u2019   with   research   which   highlights   skill\nweaknesses  in  graduate  marketers,  in  areas  such  as   negotiation,   problem   formulation   and\nleadership. The lack of the former of these skills is also noted by the  research  of  Stringfellow  et.\nal. (2006). Significantly, Taylor (2003) points out that  employers  are  increasingly  focussing  on\nhiring applicants for marketing positions who can demonstrate skills that will  help  them  perform\nwell on the job.\nThe emphasis on the need to develop in new marketers more general  skill  sets  is  highlighted  by\nthe Marketing and Sales Standard Setting Body (see MSSB 2010). This  body  has  also  produced\nevidence to show that employers are less concerned about the subject of the  degree,  more  on  the\npossession of graduate skills. Wellman (2008) poses  the  all  important  question  \u2018Are  marketing\ndegrees fit for purpose?\u2019 This paper contends that in  particular  ways  they  are  not,  arguing  that\nthere is a need to rethink some of the ways in which marketing students are taught. The contention\nhere is that marketing education  does not take sufficient  account  of  experiential  based  learning\nmethods and instead, is wedded to a model of marketing teaching that is  sees  it  as  being  mainly\nabout the transmission of administratively based knowledge. Administrative based marketing  is  a\nterm largely associated with the research of Hills et. al. (2008).  In  their  work,  they  show  that  a\nmajor preoccupation of the academy is the  understanding  of  marketing  in  terms  of  a  series  of\nobjective,  largely  bureaucratic  linear  steps  which  students  must  learn  and  then   be   able   to\nregurgitate as necessary (Cunningham 1999; Hills et. al.  2008;  Hackley  2009).  For  Hills  et.  al.\n(2008), the administrative marketing framework has limited use, failing to  provide  a  sufficiently\nnuanced view of the world and  the  types  of  activities  marketers  actually  undertake.  The  key\nobjective of this paper is to show that marketing student\u2019s skill levels  in  a  variety  of  areas\nare positively influenced by exposure to experiential based  learning  methods.  Rather  than\ningesting  a  continuous  diet  of  education  based  largely  on  an  administrative   model   of\nmarketing, this  paper  will  show  that  students  enthusiastically  embrace  an  approach  to\nlearning that enables them to experience and  analyse  marketing  as  it  happens  in  a  work\nbased context.\nAs a consequence, this paper advocates the use of action learning programmes  in  university\nmarketing education. A central issue that this perspective deals with  is  that  when  students\nlearn  about  marketing,  it  is  not  just  a  question  of  them   simply    engaging   in   theory\naccumulation, but of learning also, about how to become a  practitioner  (McGill  and  Beaty\n2001). Importantly though,  this  should  not  be  the  only  approach  to  pedagogical  design.\nWhilst it is clearly important for students  to  acquire  the  skills  necessary  for  an  effective\nworking life, it can also be argued that marketing education should not merely be  about  the\nprocedural activity of managerial problem  solving,  but  act  to  engage  students  in  critical\nreflection. Criticism can mean and  take  a  variety  of  forms  in  an  educational  context.  It\nshould be able to sit alongside the type of action learning  module  this  paper  proposes.  For\nMingers (2000), all management courses, which by  implication  includes  marketing,  should\ncontain a critical element organised around a range of guiding principles. These  include  for\nexample,  the  need  to  be  sceptical  of  established  principles  and  the  idea  of   value   free\nknowledge.  Alternatively,  it  is  conceivable  that  critical  marketing   studies   modules   be\noffered, in order to connect studies to some of the  deeper  intellectual  arguments  that  exist\naround  the  discipline  (Hackley   2009).   Controversial   issues   could   be   examined,   like\nmarketing\u2019s  relationships  with   the  physical  environment,   the   disciplines   tendency   to\nuniversalise theory, the promulgation of models  of  the  consumer  based  on  individual  self\ninterest and marketing\u2019s apparent exclusive focus on profit (Tadajewski and Brownlie 2008;\nSaren et. al. 2007).\nLINCOLN BUSINESS SCHOOL AND THE STUDENT CONSULTANCY PROJECT \n The general argument in this paper, regarding the utility  of  an  action  learning  approach  to\nengage students through appropriate experiences, is supported by reference to research  carried\nout at Lincoln University,  UK,  with  a  group  of  marketing  students.  In  the  Lincoln  Business\nSchool (Taylor 2009),  a  third  year  undergraduate  module  is  in  operation,  for  single  honours\nmarketing students, which is based  on  a  marketing  research  consultancy  activity,   hence  forth\nreferred to as the MRC project. This module, unlike many others that marketing students  study  is\nbased on the philosophy and methods of action learning (Jones 1990;  McGill  and  Beaty  (2001).\nThe yearlong module, which sits alongside other marketing modules on the third  year  of  the  full\ntime course, is designed principally, to expose students to learning in the workplace rather than  in\nthe classroom.  In the first part of the module, the focus is on giving students a  sufficient  level  of\nskills and knowledge to enable them, in the  second  part  of  the  module,  to  work  with  a  client\norganisation.  Course  participants  study  areas  including  the  writing  of   a   brief,   negotiation,\npreparing results and executing a range of research  methods.  In  the  second  part  of  the  module\nstudents  are  given  an  actual  marketing  management  problem  to  resolve,  usually  relating   to\ncustomers. Client companies are expected to  pay  a  small  fee  for  the  services  of  the  students,\nproviding a degree of realism.  Working  in  small  self  selective  groups,  course  participants  are\nexpected to develop this problem into a research question, where a brief - a set  of  objectives  -  is\nprepared in conjunction with the client company.\nStudents work independently on the subsequent project, carrying out research and analysis, with  a\nsupervising tutor who acts as a guide and facilitator. Students are then encouraged to prepare  their\nown marketing strategy  for  the  company  in  response  to  the  set  problem.  As  a  consequence,\nstudents need to employ a wide range of skills in order to complete the project successfully. These\nskills can include for example negotiation, the  application  of  numeracy,  teamwork,  competitive\nanalysis,  problem  solving,  creativity,  and  communication  in  a  variety  of  forms.   The   client\ncompany is involved throughout the duration of the project in a mentoring role. A  wide  range  of\nlocal companies are involved in the project. Companies to date have included those selling locally\nproduced soaps, document handlers, steel manufacturers, an interior designer,  the  local  cathedral\nand charities. The sorts of problems the student group might be asked to respond  to  may  include\nissues such as attempts to increase sales, finding new markets and market segments for a  product.\nAlternatively, students may be asked to report on  consumer  responses  to  a  range  of  marketing\ninitiatives and then suggest changes to current strategy. At the end of the module, a presentation is\nmade to the company and a report written up, both marked by the tutor. A representative from  the\ncompany provides oral feedback. Importantly, these  are  real  business  activities  where  students\nmust try to use  the  skills  and  knowledge  they  have  to  the  best  of  their  abilities  in  order  to\nsuccessfully complete a live project.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHOD\nThe  research  method  used  in  this  study  was  underpinned  by   an   interpretative   perspective\n(Marshall and Rossman 1999). Drawing  on  qualitative  methods,  the  research  sought  to  obtain\naccess to the perceptions of students on the Lincoln MRC project.  Hackley (2003) points out  that\nan interpretivist approach is designed to generate written accounts  of  experience  as  data  and  in\nline with this, the  research  was  intended  to  elicit  some  in  depth  understanding  of  the  issues\ndiscussed above. Data was not generated  in  an  attempt  to  excavate  universal  truths.  The\nresearch  here  is  idiographic,  not  an  antecedent  to  a  quantitative  statistical  study.  The\nintention was to generate insight into the ways in  which  the  social  reality  of  those  on  the\nMRC course is constructed. As a consequence, the sampling approach  adopted  is  based  on\nthe suitability of the student group in terms of the problem  being  investigated.  The  sixteen\nrespondents in the convenience sample were selected with  the  intention  being  of  analysing\nthe impact of the MRC  project\u2019s  learning  methods  on  their  skill  set.  Sampling  involving\nnotions of generalisability to some external reality were not applicable in this case,  as  researchers\nwere seeking the views of course participants studying in one location. This type of  concern  with\ngeneralisability can be seen as being incompatible with an  interpretive  approach  which  sees  the\ndata of the study as meaningful and as an end in itself (Hackley 2003).\n The study involved four separate but linked pieces  of  research,  representing  at  the  time,  the\ntotal number of students studying for a single honours marketing award  in  the  Lincoln  Business\nSchool. The sample is analogous to  the  wider  student  body  studying  marketing  and  it  is\nargued here that the implications of the findings of this study have  the  potential  for  much  wider\nconsideration and application in marketing and business education generally. At  the  end  of  the\nfirst semester, before undertaking the MRC project,  students  were  asked  to  complete  an  open\nended questionnaire with the aim of establishing what they expected to gain  from  the  placement\nwith the  company  and  also,  what  they  thought  about  the  marketing  degree  currently  being\nstudied. Students were asked questions  about  the  value  of  textbooks,  the  lecture  and  seminar\nprogramme across the degree and what marketing skills  they  thought  were  being  achieved  and\nwhat would be achieved, as a result of the MRC project.  Later, whilst the MRC project  was\nunderway, two focus group interviews, each with eight student members  and  a  moderator,  took\nplace. A range of issues, reflecting the objectives of the study, concerned with marketing skills\nand their acquisition, were discussed, which allowed for the deeper   elaboration  of  thoughts\nand opinions, not possible in the open ended  questionnaires.  Finally,  on  completion  of  the\nMRC work with employers, a second open ended questionnaire was given to all sixteen students\nasking them to provide general feedback on the experience.  Questions  were  directed  at  finding\nout what skills students thought they had acquired as a result of the MRC project, how the  project\nmight impact on their employability and what they now thought about the rest of  their  marketing\ndegree. With regard to both questionnaire and focus groups,  it  would  have  been  useful  to\nhave done  a pilot of the research, but time was a  limiting  factor  with  both  student  access\nand availability becoming increasingly restricted as the academic year moved on,  making  it\ndifficult to carry out research on  the target group.\nAll the open ended questions were self completed by respondents, enabling relatively full answers\nto  be  compiled  in  a  situation  unencumbered  by  the  constraints  of  a  structured   quantitative\nquestionnaire (Bradley 2007). The latter points out that open ended questions have  the  advantage\nof providing full answers and make possible the exploration of issues, a key aim  of  interpretative\nbased research  (Hackley  2003).  Research  therefore  spanned  a  time  period  from  the  end  of\nsemester one to almost the end of semester  two.  The  pre  consultancy  preparation  phase  was\ncovered, the consultancy project  itself  and  then  the  post  consultancy  phase.   In  terms  of  the\neventual  data  analysis,  both  the  two  questionnaires  and  two  focus  group   interviews   were\nanalysed in order to understand and write up the  emergent  key  themes.  These  were  selected  in\nterms of their relevance to the skills debate in marketing education and to the  objectives  of  this\nstudy. These themes appear in  this  paper  as  a  series  of  quotes,  reflecting  a  process  used  in\npresenting interpretative data (Marshall and Rossman 1999).  In  the  next  section,  focus  group\nand questionnaire comments are considered interchangeably. Both are compatible  in  terms\nof being qualitative in nature,  the  only  difference  being  that  the  focus  group  has  longer\nquestions and longer  responses.  What  follows  is  a  discussion  of  the  key  findings  of  the\nresearch, considered in relation to some of the important literature on the topic.\nFINDINGS: DOING AND LEARNING MARKETING IN PRACTICE\nTeam working, communication and interaction\nIn the  context  of  teamwork,  Cunningham  (1999)  makes  some  important  points.  Drawing  on\nfindings from a research project of  400  marketing  practitioners  aimed  at  identifying  employer\nsatisfaction with graduate skill levels, he notes that 97% felt teamwork was essential, but that only\n57% of  graduates  were  adequately  equipped  in  this  area.  The  same  research  illustrated  that\nsuccessful marketing practitioners rated the ability to get on  with  people  as  the  most  important\nattribute graduates could possess. On the MRC project, students generally  found  the  opportunity\nto work in teams to be a very affirmative experience, recognising  it  as  being  a  central  skill  for\nwork, as reflected in the following two responses drawn  from  the  post  consultancy  open  ended\nquestionnaires. For one student, the MRC project,\n\u2018Improved my knowledge and confidence in working in a team  and  improved  my  confidence  in\ngaining information.\u2019\nA second respondent noted that the MRC project,\n\u2018Was very positive, it\u2019s been good to work in teams  and  try  to  put  theory  and  knowledge  into\npractice and trying to undertake research.\u2019\nThe research of Dacko (2006) largely supports the importance Cunningham attaches to teamwork.\nIn a survey  of  marketing  practitioners,  the  former  found  that  interpersonal  skills  was  ranked\nhighly by marketing professionals, along with the ability to work in a team. The work of Fleischer\nand Wright (2008), in completing the initial stages of a major  piece  of  funded  research  into  the\nskills needed by marketing competitive analysts, found that the latter have to routinely  work  with\nothers, with final outcomes of a project often being a joint effort. The MRC  closely  mirrors  this.\nOther students on the MRC project take up this issue  of  teamwork,  clearly  recognising  that  the\ncourse provides them with this important skill for  working  in  marketing.  The  open  ended  post\nconsultancy questionnaire indicates that the MRC course provided,\n\u2018Insight into working in a team for a business type project\u2019 And in the case where students  had  to\nwork with a start up venture, the MRC project showed them that,\n\u2018Team  work  is  important  and  putting  together  a  report  for  somebody  with  little   marketing\nexperience or knowledge and making it relevant to them.\u2019\nIn one of the focus groups, a respondent said that  the  following  was  a  positive  outcome  of  the\nMRC project.\n\u2018Interacting with clients, and communicating in the real world with clients rather than talking\nabout all the models that we talk about here on the course.\u2019\nTacit knowledge, experience and skill development\nAs highlighted earlier,  there  is  an  additionally  important  implication  represented  here  by  the\nability of marketing graduates, and indeed marketers  generally,  to  interact  in  teams  effectively.\nThe area in question is that of tacit knowledge, a central  aspect  of  marketing  in  practice  that  is\nroutinely ignored by much of the traditional administrative approach (Hackley 1999; Ardley 2006;\nTapp 2004). In the case of the explicit, knowledge is codifiable and  transmitted  in  a  formal  and\nsystematic language, whereas tacit is personal and often difficult to convey  and  express  to  those\noutside the area of expertise in question (Baumard 1999). For students on the MRC  project,  there\nappears to be recognition that the workplace is not just about  being  able  to  demonstrate  explicit\nmarketing knowledge. They see it as involving other experiential  factors  that  elude  the  familiar\ntextbooks used on marketing degrees. In the pre consultancy questionnaire, it was pointed  out  by\none student that the MRC course will,\n\u2018Put marketing into a real environment where models and concepts may not always work.\u2019\nBeyond the marketing models lays another reality then. Hackley  (1999)  argues  the  tacit  area  of\npractical knowledge refers to action which is left out of abstracted theoretical descriptions, but  on\nwhich the accomplishment of action depends. Hackley goes  on  to   argue   that  a  person  who  is\nhighly accomplished in strategic marketing decision making, is likely to be able to utilise  difficult\nand experientially mediated concepts in coping with marketing issues.  In the majority of standard\nstudent marketing texts, a deep silence exists with regard to the area of tacit knowledge. This is an\noversight. Tapp (2004) notes that in socialisation, tacit  knowledge  is  exchanged  through  jointly\nperformed  activities  as  individuals   spend   time   together.   From   another   professional   area,\nHindmarsh and Pilnick (2002), in looking at the practical  accomplishment  of  work  in  operating\ntheatres, illustrate that in anaesthesia, tacit knowledge and teamwork are central to the  acquisition\nof expertise. From a practical, rather than from a textual perspective, socialisation can  be  seen  as\nbeing the basis of knowledge transfer in organisations, where communities of practice  are  crucial\n(see Lave and Wenger 1999; Wenger 1998). One respondent on  the  MRC  course  picked  up  on\nthis, noting how knowledge is created in social situations by team interaction. It was stated  in  the\npost consultancy questionnaire that the MRC project had enabled the individual to,\n\u2018Learn to work in a team where we shared the knowledge of the team and developed more ideas.\u2019\nFrom  the  learning  about  marketing   perspective,   understanding   tacit   knowledge,   which   is\nembedded in experience,  can  lead  to  skill  development  if  nurtured  correctly.  For  Hill  et.  al.\n(1998),  an  extremely  important  component  of  their  work  based  learning  programme  at   the\nUniversity  of  Ulster  was  the  acquisition  by  students   of   experience.   Having   undertaken   a\nmarketing activity, they could reflect on that experience and learn from it.  On  the  Lincoln  MRC\nproject, the post work logs completed by students provide the facility for reflection  on  their  own\nindividual and group experiences. Through working with client companies, it is highly  likely  that\nstudents will make use  of  the  firm\u2019s  stock  of  tacit  knowledge  and  build  it  into  their  review\ndiscussion, where it will feed into the individuals  own skill development. As a  result,  The  MRC\nstudents clearly recognise the indispensable role  of  experience  and  its  role  in  developing  their\nmarketing expertise. One respondent in a focus group reflected that the MRC  project  had  helped\nthem to,\n\u2018Gain knowledge and  experience  working  with  real  companies.\u2019  Another  student  in  the  post\nconsultancy questionnaire noted that the project was invaluable, \u2018because it has given  me  a  huge\namount of real world experience.\u2019\nCreativity as a marketing skill\nIn the focus group one respondent commented that in  terms  of  modules  being  studied  on  their\nmarketing degree,\n\u2018It was fixed on the theories rather than  on  doing  modules  which  help  you  develop  marketing\nskills, things that will help you later on in life, we  should  for  example   be  doing  more  creative\nthings\u2019\nThis last quote clearly raises the issue of creativity as a  skill,  which  is  arguably  fundamental  to\nsuccessful marketing performance. The  notion  of  what  constitutes  creativity  and  how  it  is\nachieved is clearly an intricate issue. One way to define it might be to say that it is simply  an\nimportant innovation, where change occurs through  some  form  of  reorganisation  process\nthat represents a new pattern of effects. This emphasis on something fresh and different  can\nactually obscure the complexities inherent in the notion of creativity. Early trait  theories  of\ncreativity saw it as being composed of a  series  of  discrete  steps  taken  by  individuals  and\nlater cognitive theorist perceive creativity to be  about  the  ability  of  individuals  to  handle\ncontradiction and paradox. The latter  is  reinforced  by  sociological  theories  of  creativity,\nwhich  stress  the  role  of  context  and  social  interaction   (Bilton   and   Cummings   2010).\nCreativity and its outcomes can thus be seen a being a multifaceted, a sometimes  ephemeral\nphenomenon to those experiencing it. In the following discussion,  although  students  do  not\nattempt to define it they seem to  recognise  that  creativity  is  about  doing  something  new,\ndifferent and value adding.  Creativity came to the fore in the focus groups as a discussion point,\nbecause it was central to MRC project. To perform effectively, students  had  to  show  ideally,  an\nabundance of creativity in terms of coming up with innovative  ideas  for  their  client  companies.\nThe  MRC  project  does  try  to  ensure  that  student\u2019s  recognise  the  importance   of   creativity,\nencouraging them to work pro  actively  and  take  opportunities  when  they  arise.  That  this  can\ncreate risks for students is acknowledged by one respondent.\n\u2018It\u2019s not just theory, in the project there will not be much margin for error, the company might\nlose some money if we mess up so we will have to be very thorough\u2019\nThis argument about risk has of course to  be  put  in  context.  Given  their  limited  level  of\nexposure to the business world, potentially any activity the students undertake for the  MRC\nfirm could be seen as being risky, with the potential to lose money. For example,  one  of  the\norganisations involved in the MRC project makes local  soaps.  So,  making  a  suggestion  to\nthem for a new fragrance or colour, based on the student  market  research  findings,  might\nbe viewed as a risk, even though only a very small, low cost investment is being made  in  the\nnew product. The firms involved quite  probably  view  the  idea  of  what  constitutes  a  risk\ndifferently to that of students. But for the latter, it is a useful learning experience in terms of\nrecognising that marketing is more often than not, about making  difficult  and  occasionally\nrisky decisions.\nIn the focus groups interviews, students tended to be generally critical  of  their  marketing  degree\nfor failing to develop creativity effectively.  One respondent pointed out that,\n\u2018Even with the module where we have had to come up with some creative ideas, market your  own\nproduct we had this good idea, this whole new approach, but we still had to mainly think about the\nproduct in relation to existing marketing models, the emphasis was on the latter which  was  really\nrestrictive and then we could not do any original marketing research, it was all second  hand  data,\nso it was not that useful in the end. We have not had enough creative things to do on the course.\u2019\nA second respondent took up this theme.\n\u2018There is a lack of chances to be creative, we are told to come up with our own ideas,  but  we  are\nnot given enough freedom. In the work there are so many models coming at you  every  week  and\nwe are told to refer back to this model or that model, its gets overwhelming.\u2019\nStudents in this study clearly recognise the importance of  being  creative  in  the  workplace,  but\ninterestingly, few of the studies on marketing  skills  generally  identify  it  as  being  an  important\nattribute that employees need to possess for working. Gray et.  al.  (2007)  in  a  wide  ranging  of\nstudy of marketing skills, comprised of  mainly educators and employers, identified  that  between\n1983 and 2006, of nineteen separate studies, only  three  show   creativity  as  being  an  important\nskill possession. As a consequence, they do  not  include  it  in  their  final  list  of  essential  skills\nrequired by marketers. Conversely, the work of Taylor (2003), whilst showing that  employers  do\nrank creativity highly, fails to adequately illustrate how educators  can  incorporate  this  skill  into\ncourse learning structures. For McCole (2005p535) however,  marketing  now  and  in  the  future,\nwill be characterised by \u2018ingenuity creativity and  innovateness\u2019,  suggesting  that  educators  must\ngive it  adequate  attention.  McCole  argues  that  marketing  employees  have  to  be  creative  by\ntapping into diverse consumer emotions and desires for experiences that the traditional  models  of\nadministrative marketing fails to reveal. If unique experiences are to  be  delivered  to  consumers,\nthen it is up to marketing employees to be at the forefront of such an  undertaking.  It  is  revealing\nthat the John  Lewis  Partnership,  one  of  the  UKs  leading  retail  operations,  lists  amongst  the\nprinciples it expects all employees to be able to exhibit is that of enterprise, or in other  words,  all\nemployees  are  expected  to  be  creative  and  innovative  in  work  place  roles  (see  John  Lewis\nPartnership 2010).\nThis notion of creativity as an important and emerging skill for  marketing  employees  to  possess\nresonates  clearly  in  the  recent  attention  being   paid   to   this   area   by   those   writing   about\nentrepreneurial marketing. Morris et. al. (2002) believe that rather than teaching marketing as a set\nof discrete principles, more attention needs to be focussed  on  entrepreneurial  skill  development.\nTopics should be pursued such as opportunity identification, risk assessment and the  management\nof cross functional innovation. It is further argued that students should be  encouraged  to  develop\ntheir own unique business models, rather than relying on established varieties. Interestingly,  Fillis\n(2004)  points  out  that  in  the  first  edition  of  Kotler\u2019s  highly  influential  book  on   marketing\nmanagement, written in 1967, there was a whole  chapter  devoted  to  creativity  which  has  since\ndisappeared. Fillis goes on to point out that creativity can be about being prepared  to  experiment,\nrather than thinking in a linear fashion as administrative marketing encourages.  For  Fillis  (2002;\n2004), creativity is about risk  taking  and  independent  thinking.  Pointedly,  these  are  necessary\nskills and ones urgently required by the employees of large organisations as well  as  small  (Miles\nand Darroch 2006).\nOverall student impressions\nIn  summary  here,  the  value  in  overall  terms  of  undertaking  the  MRC  course  and  of  doing\nactivities like this was rated very highly by most students, when they  were  asked  to  produce  an\nanswer evaluating the module.  The  following  responses,  extracted  from  the  final  open  ended\nquestionnaire are fairly typical. One respondent commented that,\n\u2018I think this project is a very good preparation for employment in  order  to  combine  theory  with\npractice, it can also be mentioned on the CV\u2019.\nAnother respondent said they would have liked,\n\u2018More work like this, it has been a very good experience and an excellent  module  for  final  level\nstudents\u2019\nAdditionally, the MRC course was seen as being very beneficial\u2026. \u2018Because  it  gives  students  a\nchance to take a problem of a company and try to solve it.\u2019\nThis problem centred learning is important as it  takes  place  not  within  a  simulated  case  study\napproach, but in  the  context  of  real  organisational  activity.  Finally,  for  one  student,  perhaps\nshowing maturity beyond their years, the MRC project was good to do\u2026 \u2018Because yes, there is no\nbetter education than real life\u2019\u2026\u2026.\nEXPERIENCE, SKILLS ACQUISITION AND THE INADEQUACY  OF  MARKETING\u2019S\nADMINSTRATIVE FRAMEWORK\nFor the students on the MRC  project,  what  was  important  for  them  was  that  it  helped  in  the\nacquisition of a range of general skills  required  in  the  workplace,  within  a  marketing  context.\nRecurrent themes  in  terms  of  skill  development  mentioned  by  students  were  team  working,\ninteraction  in  the  workplace,  communication  and  creativity.  These,   with   the   exception   of\ncreativity,  are  generally  identified  as  being   among   the   most   important   skills   needed   by\norganisations employing marketers (Dacko 2006; Martin and Chapman 2006; Grey  et.  al.  2007).\nStudents,  in  their  responses,  placed  a  great  deal  of  emphasis  on  the  benefits  of  real   work\nexperience time and time again. This is despite the fact that  students  will  routinely  be  faced\nduring their degree course at Lincoln, with assessments that demand they utilise work based\nskills.   These   include   group   presentations   and   investigative   type   projects   involving\nnegotiations and team working with their peers. What the findings suggest is that  the  MRC\nproject successfully builds on these and other  nascent  skill  sets.  The  important  reference\npoint of experience mentioned by students informs the development of the MRC module.  As\nwell as being linked to a social theory of learning (Wenger 1998),  the  MRC  project  can  be\nseen to be partly inspired by a constructivist approach to  education,  with  experience  at  its\ncentre  (Papert  1980).  The  essence  of  constructivism  is  that  the  individual  is  the  active\ncreator  of  their  own  knowledge.  The  constructivist  perspective   suggests   that   learners\nconstruct their own understanding and knowledge  of  the  world  through  various  types  of\nexperiences  and  then  reflect  on  those  experiences.  In  the  context  of  the  MRC  project,\nstudents experienced things like group working and negotiation which they then reflected on\nand built into their own knowledge base. Additionally, in constructivism, when an individual\nencounters something new, it has to be reconciled with previous ideas and experience and  as\na consequence, a change may occur in what is believed (Wenger 1998). For  the  students  on\nthe MRC project, as was illustrated, some views changed on marketing  as  a  result  of  their\nencounters with the practitioner world. \nIt is argued that behind the problems of  marketing  pedagogy,  where  question  marks  hang  over\nstudent\u2019s skill levels, is the administrative model of marketing that dominates business  schools  in\nuniversities. The research of Hills et. al. (2008) found that successful entrepreneurs held  cognitive\nmodels of marketing that did not come anywhere near those offered in leading textbooks  and  that\npractitioners  were  found  to  be  successful  in  unconventional  ways.  To   be   effective   in   the\nworkplace, students will need to learn these processes, or ones like them. The problem for practice\nlearning is that the prescriptions of orthodox marketing come in  the  form  of  a  decision  making\napparatus  that  assumes  predictable  individuals  and  an  unproblematic  process.  Both  of  these\nassumptions fall  well  short  of  the  complexities  of  actual  practice.   The  model  of  marketing\neducation that has the ascendency is one of a bureaucratic variety, often represented as a  series  of\nlinear steps that companies and learners must pass through before success, or true knowledge,  can\nbe obtained. For  example,  marketing  audits  are  followed  by  marketing  strategy  and  then  by\nmarketing  tactics.  For  Brownlie  and  Saren  (1997)  this  type  of  marketing  discourse   is   one\ndimensional, lacking the realities and nuances of the business world, yet it is the one students\u2019  are\ntold reflects practice. Brown (2008) notes that many successful marketers have  never  studied  the\nsubject formally, suggesting that the types of skills discussed in this paper are  central  to  working\nlife and hence more relevant. Further, as  Hackley (2009) has recently argued,  marketing  strategy\ncan be seen as being chaotic and intuitive, yet still  successful,  not  necessarily  composed  of  the\nexplicit planning stages found in the administrative model of marketing.  This  suggests  that  it  is\nexperience that will teach students the importance of intuition, not traditional marketing theory.  It\ncan be posited then, that a reliance on only formal descriptions of marketing will make it  unlikely\nthat would be marketers will be able to acquire the implicit practices required to be effective in the\nworkplace.\nReflected  to  some  extent  in  the  MRC  course,  Lave  and  Wenger  (1991)  have  developed  an\nanalytical concept known as legitimate peripheral participation,  which  assists  in  the  process  of\ngaining knowledge in the work situation. This concept derives from an  interpretation  of  learning\nin the apprenticeship  situation.  Brownlie  and  Spender  (1995),  also  argue  that  the  process  of\nacquiring the experience which shapes managerial judgement can be gained by the novice through\nworking with those who have already demonstrated ownership of  the  appropriate  abilities.  As  a\nconsequence,  in  order  that  newcomers  to  the  wider  marketing   community   can   accumulate\nknowledge and acquire skills, they must participate  in  the  social  and  cultural  practices  of  that\nsame community. This suggests a strong  role  for  modules  like  the  MRC  project  in  marketing\neducation.  Marketing knowledge and skills cannot be acquired effectively in the  abstract  and,  as\nMartin and Chapman\u2019s (2006) evidence points out, it is  unfortunately  true  that  many  marketing\ngraduates have little understanding of how the discipline relates  to  the  small  and  medium  sized\nbusiness sector. Without some experience gained  in  the  workplace  by  students,  actual  practice\ncannot be well understood. In the findings section above,  course  members  on  the  MRC  project\nseem  to  readily  recognise  this  fact.   Importantly,  they  are  given  the  opportunity  to   explore\nmarketing in an applied situation and to use  a  range  of  skills  in  context.  This  paper  questions\ntherefore,  the  simple  transfer  view  of  knowledge,   which   dominates   much   learning   about\nmarketing.\nCONCLUSION:  ACTION  LEARNING  AND  THE  EDUCATION   OF   TOMORROWS\nMARKETERS\nIt is argued that the structure and delivery of the  MRC  project  represents  a  way  to  initiate  and\ndevelop the skills required for the marketers of tomorrow. As a consequence,  the  above  findings\npoint strongly in the direction of adopting a style  of  learning  about  marketing  that  is  rooted  in\npractice. It is important to recognise however, that courses of this  nature  can  be  expensive.\nThis is in terms of staffing and resources, yet  it  is  an  important  aspect  of  learning  which\nshould be made more widely available, if the positive reports of the students here  are  taken\ninto account.  In  order  to  ensure  that  other  marketing  advertising  and  public  relations\nstudents can do the MRC project in their third year, an employer engagement officer  in  the\nLincoln Business School with an assistant has been  appointed.  The  role  is  to  source  more\norganisations that require consultancy type projects.  In  this  way,  with  tutors  in  place  to\ndeliver the module, all students who enter the final year of the degree will not be short of  an\norganisation to work with.  Clearly,  without  the  support  of  local  organisations  the  MRC\nproject would not run and in this sense the employer engagement officer plays a vital role.\nAlthough based on a small sample the research results indicate here that what students see  as\nbeing central to understanding practice differs somewhat from what the  administrative  marketing\nframework  sees  as  important  for  learning.  It  is  significant  that  the  majority  of   respondents\nunderstand the importance of acquiring communicative,  team  and  interpersonal  skills.  Students\nrealise these skills will help them develop a form of practice knowledge  that  is  more  relevant  to\nwork,  as opposed to the  reliance on  the model  laden marketing texts they are familiar with. It  is\nquestionable to assume that many of the models students examine are actually that useful anyway,\nas  Piercy  (1995)  has  pointed  out.  While  it  is  acknowledged  that  the  skills  students  see   as\nimportant have been recognised by other research studies, the key issue here is how to ensure  that\nthese same skills are acquired effectively. Certainly,  the  Lincoln  MRC  module  is  not  alone  in\nbasing its approach on action learning (see  McLouglin  2004).  An  additional  interesting  insight\nfrom the Lincoln study, a topic which has probably not received the attention it deserves, indicates\nthat through socialisation and experience, tacit  knowledge  can  be  gained.  A  further  previously\nneglected area, although its importance is recognised by students, is  the  skill  of  creativity.  Both\nthese areas are worthy of more research. In particular, it is recommended  that  work  needs  to  be\nundertaken to  examine  analytically  the  role  of  the  tacit  in  marketing  and  its  relationship  to\nexperience and skill development.\nThe main recommendation here however is that action learning becomes central to learning  about\nmarketing, an argument supported by Cuningham (1999). Action learning emphasises learning  by\ndoing (Kable  1989),  where  participants  work  on  a  defined  topic  which  is  significant  to  the\nindividuals themselves, resulting in effective action. This is  the  approach  adopted  on  the  MRC\nproject, where students get to choose the company they want to  work  with.  Students  learn  from\nexperience, share that experience with others and have those colleagues criticise and  advise.  This\nis termed as the \u2018comrades in adversity\u2019 approach to learning and is a basis  for  assessing  how  to\nimprove one\u2019s own individual skills (Margerison  1988  p43).   On  the  MRC  project,  the  action\nlearning set is the student group working for the client. Learning sets usually have a  facilitator,  in\nthe case of the MRC project it is the tutor who acts as a guide. Advice is given  to  students,  but  a\nconscious attempt is made not to lay down any prescriptive guidelines; the learning set  must  find\nits own way through the marketing problem of the company they are working for.  In terms of  the\nactual learning cycle, the latter involves experimentation, which is doing the job,  or  dealing  with\nthe problem. This should be accompanied by some reflective observation of the experience by  the\nlearner. On the MRC module, as noted previously, students after doing  the  project,  then  write  a\nreflective  log  on  their  experiences.  In  a  programme  based  on   this   perspective,   innovative\napproaches could  also  be  tried,  for  example  to  examine  the  working  metaphors  used  in  the\ncompany of the project, thus providing important insights into the  nature  of  marketing  problems\nand their possible resolution (Fillis and Rentschler 2008).\nIn terms of developing more  of  a  pluralistic  approach  to  marketing  as  advocated  by  Hackley\n(2001), all the new insights gained from the MRC action learning  sets  could  be  compared,  in  a\nvariety of ways, with other new or established  theoretical  and  practical  approaches  which  form\npart of the marketing knowledge base. This means that the action learning process enables a  local\nand socially constructed knowledge of marketing to be worked on and debated, reflecting to  some\nextent the concerns of Martin and Chapman  (2006).  More  generally  what  the  emphasis  of  the\nMRC project mirrors, is a move in thinking across parts of the university  sector.  The  focus  is  to\ninvolve  students  more  in   activities   that   are   inquiry   and   problem   based,   where   original\ninvestigations take place, rather than  learning  only  through  traditional  pedagogy.  Students  are\nencouraged in this perspective to learn by engagement in a real research  project,  which  can  then\nlead to the generation of new knowledge and its dissemination through appropriate sources (Neary\n2009).  The whole approach of the MRC project actually represents a major departure from  much\nmainstream marketing teaching and as can be seen, is highly  valued  by  Lincoln  students,  where\nthey see it developing their skills for working life. The next  stage  in  the  research  could  involve\nidentifying  employer  responses  to  the  project,  perhaps  picking  up  on  particular   skills,   like\ncreativity.  Finally here, the emphasis on action learning does not mean that  all  other  approaches\nto marketing education be abruptly dismissed, or that an overly instrumental  approach  dominates\nthe curriculum, a point raised in the introduction. There should be room to not only engage with\nfunctional criticisms of how marketing actually works in practice,  but  reflective  learning  should\nalso  take  place   regarding   marketing   ethics   and   additionally,   the   disciplines    intellectual\nfoundations. In regard to the latter, there is a need to show that it  is  capable  of  transcending  the\nacademic shallowness  often  subscribed  to  it.  Challenges  exist  in  this  area,  where  marketing\neducation might seem to be possessed of  a  narrow,  functional  knowledge  base.   The  important\npoint here however, is that marketing educators engage  with  the  debate  raised  above  regarding\naction learning, the value of projects like the MRC  and think about the consequences for  students\nand their later working lives. We owe this at least, to the marketers of tomorrow.\nREFERENCES\nArdley, B. C.
