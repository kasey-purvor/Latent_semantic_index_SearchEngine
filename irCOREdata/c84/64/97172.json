Phenom.\nVol. 4, No. 4, 2009, pp. 1-2\nPreface\nThe past decade has seen explosive growth in the use of mathematical and computational tools\nto address problems in the biosciences and medicine. The challenges are novel and unique: how\ndo we cope with the vast amount of experimental data being generated, the huge number of com-\nponents involved and their complex interactions?\nIncreasingly, theoreticians are beginning to make real advances in this field and much of their\nsuccess has stemmed from changes in the nature of their research. It is now very clear that for inter-\ndisciplinary research to have a true impact, an intimate engagement with the science is required\u2014\nthe mathematics cannot be done in a vacuum. The articles in this special issue bear testament to that\napproach as, to varying degrees, they assess model behaviour critically in the light of experimental\ndata.\nThe paper by Othmer et al. presents a detailed review of pattern formation in three classical\nexperimental systems, the fruitfly Drosophila, the bacterium E. coli and pigmentation patterning\nin fish. It presents a range of models that have been proposed in each case, compares and contrasts\nthem in terms of their properties, and critiques them in the context of experimental data. The\npaper also addresses the effects of domain growth on patterning, a subject area that has received\nsurprisingly little attention given its importance.\nIt has been known for decades that reaction-diffusion models can produce arrays of repeating\npatterns similar to those observed in nature. Headon and Painter review this mainly in the con-\ntext of feather germ patterning in the chick and discuss in detail how such models must now be\nvalidated and extended in light of the new biological findings that allow concrete definitions of\nthe hypothetical chemical players proposed by these models. They define a number of challenges\nthat must be met by both the experimental and theoretical communities if we are to gain greater\ninsights into the underlying mechanisms that give rise to repeated patterns during morphogenesis.\nCai et al. study homeostasis and control of cell population levels in the epidermis. Specif-\nically, they investigate multi-scale regulation between extracellular secreted factors and intracel-\nlular models and delimit regions in parameter space where the model predicts homeostasis. The\nfocus in their paper is on the proto-oncogene, c-Myc, an intracellular transcription factor which\naffects both proliferation and differentiation.\nMiura and Tanaka study how capillary networks form in human umbilical vein endothelial\ncells. This problem has attracted much attention and a number of modelling approaches based\non different biological hypotheses have been proposed. To validate\/invalidate such models it is\nimportant to determine biologically realistic parameter values within the models. This paper shows\nhow, with the rapid recent advances in imaging techniques, it is now becoming possible to obtain\n1\nArticle available at http:\/\/www.mmnp-journal.org or http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1051\/mmnp\/20094400\nPreface\nthe sort of quantitative data necessary to enable such evaluations.\nZhu et al. consider the problem of cartilage patterning in the limb bud. They formulate a\ncaricature reaction-diffusion model on a growing domain and solve the resultant equations using a\ndiscontinuous Galerkin finite element method. They show that the model can capture the increase\nin patterning elements as the domain grows due to dramatic changes in various parameters linked\nto the distribution of Hox gene products in the apical ectodermal ridge.\nMerks and Koolwijk review a number of cell-based models in the context of in vitro experi-\nments and show that several models, based on different biological assumptions, are qualitatively\nconsistent with experimental observations. They focus particularly on chondrogenesis and vascu-\nlogenesis, and suggest that in order to make further progress in model validation we now require a\nconcerted effort aimed at careful quantification of parameters so that the validation process can be\nsufficiently refined to allow distinction between models. As an example, they illustrate how this\nmight be done for the increasingly used Cellular Potts model.\nThis selection of papers illustrates the real need for an iterative process between model pre-\ndiction, experimental validation and model refinement in light of experimental results. It is only\nthrough many cycles of this process that mathematical modelling will realise its full potential as a\npotent tool in helping us answer some of the most exciting scientific questions of this century. The\nstart-of-the-art is nicely summed up by Othmer et al.: \u201c...we are at the beginning of a transition\nin the modeling of development in biology. Models are changing from qualitative descriptions\nto explain some peculiar or non-intuitive data, to quantitative models that make predictions that\ncan be tested experimentally to drive the biology forward. As mathematical models of biological\nmechanisms continue to provide significant new insights into the underlying biology that can be di-\nrectly assayed in vivo, we will observe a revolution in biology that transforms it from a qualitative,\nobservation-driven discipline, to a quantitative, analysis-driven discipline.\u201d\nP.
