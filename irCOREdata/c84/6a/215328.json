When we are informed of some proposition, \nwe do not only learn the proposition in question, but also that we have learned the \nproposition as one of the many propositions that we might have learned.  The \ninformation is generated by a protocol, which determines the various propositions that \nwe might learn.  We should then update not on the proposition in question, but rather \n 2 \non the fact that we learned this proposition as one of the many propositions that we \nmight have learned.    \n \nA well-known application of this insight is the Monty Hall problem (MH) as Speed \n(1985: 276) points out in a discussion of Shafer (1985).  As an illustration, let us \napply Shafer\u2019s insight to the MH.  In the MH, the contestant in a game show learns \nthat there is a goat behind two of three doors X, Y and Z and a car behind one door.  \nShe is asked to pick one of the three doors.  The contestant picks door X.  Monty will \nthen open one of the remaining doors, which he knows to have a goat behind it.  \nSuppose Monty opens door Y.  The contestant is then asked whether she wants to stick \nto the door she originally chose, i.e. door X, or whether she wants to switch to the \nother unopened door, i.e. door Z.  Should the contestant switch doors, assuming that \nshe wants to win the car rather than a goat? \n \nIf we naively update only on the content of the information, viz. that there is a goat \nbehind door Y, then we reach the following conclusion:  \n \n(1)  2\/1\n3\/2\n3\/11\n)(\n)()|()|( =\u00d7==\nGoatYP\nCarXPCarXGoatYPGoatYCarXP  \n \nHence P(CarZ\u2502GoatY) = 1\/2 as well and so,  on this reasoning, it does not make any \ndifference whether she does or does not switch doors.  But, as is well-known, this \nreasoning is incorrect.  We do not only learn that there is a goat behind door Y, we \nalso learn that we learn this information as one of a range of possible items of \ninformation that Monty might have provided.  If the protocol specifies that Monty will \nopen one of the remaining doors with a goat behind it, then there are two items of \n 3 \ninformation that the contestant might receive, viz. \u201cA goat is behind door Y\u201d and the \n\u201cA goat is behind door Z\u201d.  Let us also specify that, as far as the contestant knows, \nMonty will randomise between doors Y and Z if both have goats behind them.  We \ncan now construct a table with conditional probabilities.  Let \u201cINF\u201d be the variable \nthat specifies the information provided by Monty and let \u201c@\u201d be the variable that \nspecifies the actual location of the car.  We construct the conditional probability table \nin Table 2.        \n \n@ = P(INF\u2502@) \nCarX CarY CarZ \nGoatY 1\/2 0 1 INF = \nGoatZ 1\/2 1 0 \n \n         Table 2 \n \nIn addition, the contestant has no reason to think one door more likely than another \nprior to Monty\u2019s information, i.e. P(@ = CarX) = P(@ = CarY) = P(@ = CarZ) = \n1\/3.  We can now calculate:  \n \n(2)  === )|(@ GoatYINFCarXP  \n \n3\/1)102\/1(3\/1\n3\/12\/1\n)(\n)()@|(\n=\n++\n\u00d7\n=\n=\n==\nGoatYINFP\nCarXPCarXGoatYINFP\n \n \n \n 4 \nSo P(@=CarZ \u2502 INF =GoatY) = 2\/3 and hence the contestant should switch doors.  \n \nAre there protocols on which the contestant has no reason to switch?  Well, suppose \nthat Monty just opens one of the remaining doors at random\u2014it may or may not have \nthe car behind it.  On this protocol, the contestant may expect four possible items of \ninformation.  We construct the conditional probability table in Table 3: \n \n@ = P(INF\u2502@) \nCarX CarY CarZ \nCarY 0 1\/2 0 \nGoatY 1\/2 0 1\/2 \nCarZ 0 0 1\/2 \nINF = \nGoatZ 1\/2 1\/2 0 \n \n       Table 3 \n \nWe calculate:  \n \n(3)     === )|(@ GoatYINFCarXP  \n \n2\/1)2\/102\/1(3\/1\n3\/12\/1\n)(\n)()@|(\n=\n++\n\u00d7\n=\n=\n==\nGoatYINFP\nCarXPCarXGoatYINFP\n \n \n 5 \nHence, on this protocol, it does not pay to switch doors.  So, the moral of the MH is \nthat the protocol is all important.  Let us now investigate whether we can gain some \nmileage from this insight for the SB and the JB.     \n \nWe structure the SB so that we can invoke the mechanism of protocols.  Let the \nstructure of the game be the proposition that awakenings can occur in all four world-\ntime quadrants (Ta-Mo, \u2026), except for He-Tu.  In the original SB, Beauty learns this \ninformation on Su and retains it throughout.  In Bovens\u2019 SB` (2010), Beauty learns on \nSu that all world-time quadrants are possible and is then told the complete structure of \nthe game upon awakening, i.e. she is told that He-Tu is actually ruled out.  Beauty \nalso knows that amnesia of this additional information is induced when she is put \nback to sleep.  This variation, he argues, cannot make for a difference to the solution \nof the SB.  \n \nTo bring in protocols, let us parse the structure of the game as follows.  Suppose that \non Su, Beauty is informed that one and only one world-time quadrant is impossible, \nbut she is not told which one, and that she will be told upon awakening which world-\ntime quadrant is impossible.  Subsequently, when she awakens, she is informed that it \nis He-Tu that is impossible.  She retains the information that she received on Su, but \namnesia of the information provided upon awakening is induced.  Let us call this the \nSB``.  This variation cannot make a difference to the solution either.  The information \nthat Beauty has at her disposal is simply parsed up differently in the SB, in the SB` \nand in the SB``.  After being informed upon awakenings in both the SB` and the SB``, \nshe knows exactly the same in the SB.   \n \n 6 \nJust like in the MH, we can now construct a conditional probability table representing \nBeauty\u2019s credences upon awakening in Table 4. @ is the variable that takes as its \nvalues the particular world-time quadrant that Beauty is in upon awakening:      \n \n@ = P(INF\u2502@) \nTa-Mo Ta-Tu He-Mo He-Tu \n\u00acTa-Mo 0 1\/3 1\/3 1\/3 \n\u00acTa-Tu 1\/3 0 1\/3 1\/3 \n\u00acHe-Mu 1\/3 1\/3 0 1\/3 \nINF = \n\u00acHe-Tu 1\/3 1\/3 1\/3 0 \n \n       Table 4  \n \nWe calculate: \n \n(4)  P*(He) = P(@=He-Mo \u2502 INF =\u00acHe-Tu) = \n \n3\/1)3\/13\/103\/1(4\/1\n4\/13\/1\n)(\n)(@)@|(\n=\n+++\n\u00d7\n=\n\u2212\u00ac=\n\u2212=\u2212=\u2212\u00ac=\nTuHeINFP\nMoHePMoHeTuHeINFP\n \n \nSo when Beauty is informed of the full structure of the game in the SB``, she will \nupdate her credence for He to 1\/3.  How the information is parsed does not make any \n 7 \ndifference to Beauty\u2019s credence.  Hence, 1\/3 should also be Beauty\u2019s posterior \ncredence for Heads in the SB.       \n \nLet us now turn to the JB.  What protocol might yield the information R \u2192\u00acS?  \nConsider the following protocol.  The informer assesses the region R and only the \nregion R in order to exclude one area\u2014i.e. to indicate an area where Judy cannot \npossibly be.  E.g. she may have access to technology that permits her to provide \nexactly one quadrant that yields a true negative for the presence of Judy.  If this is the \ncase, then the protocol may yield two items of information, viz. INF = R \u2192\u00acS or INF \n= R \u2192\u00acQ.  Let @ be the variable which takes the actual location of SB as its values, \nso @ = BQ, BS, RQ, or RS.  We spell out the conditional probabilities in Table 5 \n \n@=    P(INF\u2502@) \nBQ BS RQ RS \nINF = R \u2192\u00acS 1\/2 1\/2 1 0 \n R \u2192\u00acQ 1\/2 1\/2 0 1 \n \nTable 5 \n \n We calculate: \n \n(5)  P*(R) = P(@ = RQ \u2502 INF =  R \u2192\u00acS) = \n2\/1)102\/12\/1(4\/1\n4\/11\n)(\n)(@)@|(\n=\n+++\n\u00d7\n=\n\u00ac\u2192=\n==\u00ac\u2192=\nSRINFP\nRQPRQSRINFP  \n \n 8 \nSo if we take into account the protocol, we see that, although the SB and the JB have \nstructural similarities, careful attention to the protocol teaches us that P*(He) = 1\/3 \nwhereas P*(R) = 1\/2.   \n \nOne might ask, Is it possible to spell out alternative protocols so that P*(He) = 1\/2 \nand P*(R) = 1\/3?  We can do so and, indeed, it will be instructive to evaluate such \nprotocols.  \n \nLet us start with the SB. Consider the following protocol.  Suppose that Beauty is put \nto sleep on Sunday and suppose she is told that a fair coin has been flipped, that there \nwill be awakenings on both Monday and Tuesday independently of the coin flip, and \nthat amnesia will be induced after an awakening.  Furthermore, when she awakens \nsomeone will inform her of one time quadrant in a Heads world in which she is not \nlocated.  Further, suppose that she is being informed that she is not in He-Tu.  Then \nthe protocol precisely mirrors the JB protocol in Table 5.     \n \n \n@= P(INF\u2502@) \nTa-Mo Ta-Tu He-Mo He-tu \n\u00acHe-Mo 1\/2 1\/2 1 0 INF = \n\u00acHe-Tu 1\/2 1\/2 0 1 \n \nTable 6  \n \n 9 \nWe can calculate that P*(He) = 1\/2.  But this is far away from the original SB.  This \nprotocol captures a game that has a radically different structure than the original SB. \n \nThe situation is less univocal in the JB.  Let us first consider two protocols on which \nP*(R) = 1\/3.  Suppose that the informer examines all quadrants and will provide JB \nwith one true negative, i.e. one quadrant in which Judy is not.  We spelled out the \nconditional probability table for this protocol in Table 7.  Or suppose that the informer \nexamines RS and is able to provide her with either a true positive or a true negative.  \nWe spelled out the conditional probability table for this protocol in Table 8.  In each \ncase, Judy does receive the information that \u00acRS.    \n   \n@ = P(INF\u2502@) \nBQ BS RQ RS \n\u00acBQ 0 1\/3 1\/3 1\/3 \n\u00acBS 1\/3 0 1\/3 1\/3 \n\u00acRQ 1\/3 1\/3 0 1\/3 \nINF = \n\u00acRS 1\/3 1\/3 1\/3 0 \n \nTable 7  \n   \n 10 \n \n@= P(INF\u2502@) \nBQ BS RQ RS \nRS 0 0 0 1 INF = \n\u00acRS 1 1 1 0 \n \nTable 8 \n \nTable 7 is structurally analogous to Table 4 and so P*(R) = 1\/3.  For Table 8, we \ncalculate \n \n(6)  P*(R) = P(@ = RQ \u2502 INF =  \u00acRS) = \n3\/1)0111(4\/1\n4\/11\n)(\n)(@)@|(\n=\n+++\n\u00d7\n=\n\u00ac=\n==\u00ac=\nRSINFP\nRQPRQRSINFP  \n \n  \nSo there do exist protocols on which P*(R) = 1\/3.  But how plausible are these \nprotocols, given the original formulation of the JB?  In the original JB puzzle, Judy \nreceives information of the form \u2018If you are in R, then the probability that that you are \nin Q is p\u2019. (vanFraassen, 1982: 366-7)  A limiting case of this information is \u2018If you \nare in R, then the probability that you are in Q is 1,\u2019 or, in other words, \u2018If you are in \nR, then you are not in S.\u2019  Now, the choice of the conditional as a mode of expressing \nthe information carries a conversational implicature that one has checked R, rather \nthan the whole area (as in the protocol underlying Table 7) or rather than RS (as in the \n 11 \nprotocol underlying Table 8).  For this reason, the protocol underlying Table 5 is more \nin line with the choice of the conditional in the informer\u2019s message.  \n \nIs there no protocol that would warrant the use of the conditional and that would yield \nP*(R) = 1\/3?  Imagine the following scenario.  Suppose that the informer is intent on \nchecking the area R.  However, due to heavy cloud cover, he can get no information \nabout RQ.  He is able to report a false positive or a false negative about RS.  If this is \nthe protocol then we are back to Table 8 and indeed P*(R) = 1\/3. Now, arguably, it \nmight not be unnatural for the informer to say \u2018If you are in R, then you are not in S\u2019 \nin such a case, since he was indeed intent on checking R and this comes through in the \nchoice of the conditional in his message.   \n \nBut, as we know from everyday life, much misunderstanding is due to misreading \nconversational implicatures.  So what is Judy supposed to do?  In the absence of a \nclear protocol, the problem is simply underdetermined.  Judy may have a subjective \nprobability distribution over alternative protocols \u2013 some yielding P*(R) = 1\/3 and \nsome yielding P*(R) = 1\/2.  If this is so, then, given her credences, she will need to \ncalculate a weighted average and P*(R) will take on a determinate value in the range \n[1\/3, 1\/2].  Or she may face radical uncertainty with respect to the protocols.  In this \ncase, there is no more to be said than that the problem is underdetermined and that \nP*(R) has upper bound 1\/2 and lower bound 1\/3.  And in the face of limited \nuncertainty with respect to protocols, Judy can determine a more narrow range of \nvalues within [1\/3, 1\/2].       \n \n 12 \nWhat makes an appeal to protocols so inviting is that it provides us not only with a \ncorrect treatment of the SB and the JB, but also with an error theory of all the \nconfusion in this area.  Simply recall the early confusion around the MH.  The MH is \na case in which the relevance of the protocol is straightforward and still, the erroneous \nsolution of P*(CarX) = 1\/2 in the actual MH was much argued for due to the \ncomplete disregard for protocols.  What underlies all the confusion about the SB and \nthe JB is the same disregard for protocols.   \n \nBovens (2010) has the virtue of recognising a certain similarity between the SB and \nthe JB.  But it fails to recognise the dissimilarity between underlying protocols.  \nProtocols are expressed in conditional probability tables that spell out the probability \nof coming to learn various propositions conditional on the actual state of the world.  \nThe principle of total evidence requires that we not update on the content of the \nproposition learned but rather on the fact that we learn the proposition in question.     \nNow attention to protocols drives a wedge between the SB and the JB.  We have \nshown that the solution to a close variant of the SB which involves a clear protocol is \nP*(He) = 1\/3 and since Beauty\u2019s has precisely the same information at her disposal in \nthe original SB at the time that she is asked to state her credence for Heads, the same \nsolution should hold.   The solution to the JB, on the other hand, is dependent on \nJudy\u2019s probability distribution over protocols.  One reasonable protocol yields P(R) = \n1\/2,  but Judy could also defend alternative values or a range of values in the interval \n[1\/3, 1\/2] depending on her probability distribution over protocols.           \n \nReferences \n \n 13 \nBovens L. 2010.
