Nuclear shapes may\nchange as a function of angular momentum and excitation\nenergy, and different shapes may coexist at the same spin and\nsimilar energies [1\u20133]. However, the oblate shape is relatively\nrare [2,4], and its collective rotation is mainly observed\nas a low-spin phenomenon in weakly deformed nuclei.\nNevertheless, in transitional nuclei a considerable number\nof collective oblate rotational bands have been identified,\nprincipally composed of \u0001I = 1 sequences [5,6] built on\nrotation-aligned quasiparticles. The best such examples in\nnuclei with well-deformed (prolate) ground states are, perhaps,\nin 134Nd [7] and 136Sm [8], but the information is sparse. In\nthe present work, recent data on the well-deformed nucleus\n175Hf [9] are interpreted as evidence for collective oblate\nrotation at I \u223c 35h\u00af.\nThere has already been considerable interest in the shapes of\nhafnium (Z = 72) isotopes at high angular momentum. The\nstable hafnium isotopes have mass numbers A = 176\u2212180.\nOn the neutron-rich side of stability, it has been predicted\n[10,11] that well-deformed, collective oblate rotation, with\ntriaxiality parameter \u03b3 \u2248 \u221260\u25e6 in the Lund convention, may\nform the yrast structure (i.e., the structure with lowest energy\nas a function of angular momentum) above I \u223c 15h\u00af. Although\nsuch behavior has not yet been identified experimentally,\nthis could simply be a consequence of the difficulty in\nstudying neutron-rich nuclei at high angular momentum.\nOn the neutron-deficient side, it has been proposed [12]\nthat triaxial superdeformed (TSD) shapes, with \u03b3 \u2248 +30\u25e6,\ndominate the observed high-spin structure. However, gaps in\nthe identified \u03b3 -ray transitions, connecting the high-spin and\nlow-spin structures, have left many open questions.\nThe recent discovery of \u0001I = 2 rotational bands in 175Hf,\nconnected by \u03b3 -ray transitions to the low-spin states, enables\nfor the first time the excitation energy and spin values in\nhafnium isotopes to be reliably determined up to I \u223c 60h\u00af [9].\nIn related work, the quadrupole moments were measured for\nhigh-spin bands in 174Hf and 175Hf, and these were found [9,13]\nto be larger than expected from theoretical estimates based\non the ultimate cranker (UC) model. In the light of these\nemerging results, the present work addresses the high-spin\nbehavior of 175Hf by comparison with total Routhian surface\n(TRS) model calculations. In contrast to the UC results [9],\nno TSD minimum is found. Rather, there is competition\nbetween a strongly deformed prolate minimum and an oblate\nminimum.\nFor the TRS calculations, the single-particle energies are\nobtained from the deformed Woods-Saxon potential [14],\nwith the Lipkin-Nogami (LN) treatment of pairing [15].\nThis avoids the spurious pairing phase transition encountered\nin the simpler BCS approach. The pairing strength G is\ndetermined by the average-gap method [16]. The total energy\nof a configuration consists of a macroscopic part, which is\nobtained from the stardard liquid-drop model [17], and a\nmicroscopic part, resulting from the Strutinsky shell correction\n[18], \u03b4Eshell = ELN \u2212 \u02dcEStrut. Calculations are performed in the\nlattice of quadrupole (\u03b22, \u03b3 ) deformations with hexadecapole\n(\u03b24) variation. For a given rotational frequency, pairing is\ntreated self-consistently by solving the cranked LN equation\nat any given point of the deformation lattice and then\nthe equilibrium deformation is determined by minimizing\nthe obtained TRS (for details, see, e.g., Refs. [19,20]).\nQuadrupole pairing in doubly stretched coordinate space [21]\nhas a negligible effect on energies but is included (with the\nstrength determined by restoring the local Galilean invariance)\nbecause it has an important influence on collective angular\nmomenta [20].\nTRS diagrams for 175Hf are shown in Fig. 1 at specific\nrotational frequencies, h\u00af\u03c9 = 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 MeV,\ncorresponding to the spin range I \u223c (30\u221260)h\u00af. The oblate\nminimum (\u03b3 \u2248 \u221260\u25e6) is evident. It is interesting to note that\nthis minimum can, in the calculations, be consistently traced\nthrough to the heavier hafnium isotopes [11] where it occurs\nat significantly lower energy. In essence, low-K, rotation-\naligned oblate structures compete at these nucleon numbers\n(Z \u2248 72, N \u2248 110) with high-K prolate configurations, which\ntypically form isomers. In Fig. 1, for 175Hf, the high-K\nprolate minimum is also evident, at \u03b3 \u2248 \u2212120\u25e6. This is\nindeed related to the experimental observation of high-K\nisomers in 175Hf [22,23]. However, an appropriate theoretical\ndescription of high-K states requires configuration-constrained\ncalculations [11], which will be the subject of a separate\nreport.\n0556-2813\/2005\/71(6)\/067303(4)\/$23.00 067303-1 \u00a92005 The American Physical Society\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 71, 067303 (2005)\nX=\u03b22cos(\u03b3+30o)\n-0.3\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4\n-0.3\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4\nY\n=\u03b2\n2s\nin\n(\u03b3+\n30\no\n)\n\u03b3=60o 30o\n0o\n-30o\n-60o\nFIG. 1.

The black dot represents the\noverall minimum in each panel, and the contours are at 200-keV\nintervals.\nThe experimental [9] and theoretical energies of rota-\ntional states are compared in Fig. 2. According to the TRS\ncalculations, which agree qualitatively with the experimental\ndata, the following interpretation may be given. At low spin,\ncollective prolate rotation is yrast (\u03b3 \u2248 0\u25e6), here represented\nby the 7\/2+[633] one-quasiparticle band. At I \u223c 30h\u00af, col-\nlective oblate rotation (band 1, \u03b3 \u2248 \u221260\u25e6) becomes yrast.\nHowever, this is taken over by strongly deformed, collective\nprolate rotation at the highest spins (band 2, \u03b22 \u2248 0.36)\nand the oblate structure terminates in noncollective prolate\nstates (\u03b3 \u2248 \u2212120\u25e6). This latter novel feature of oblate-to-\nprolate termination contrasts with the well-studied termination\nof collective prolate rotation in noncollective oblate states\n(\u03b3 \u2248 +60\u25e6) [24].\nThe kinematic moments of inertia depend on the energy-\nversus-spin gradients of Fig. 2, so that although the calculated\nand experimental moments of inertia for the 7\/2+ band and\nband 2 are in quite good agreement, the variation with spin\nfor band 1 is poorly reproduced. This may be a consequence\nof the high dependence of the oblate band on rotation-aligned\nquasiparticles, with successive proton and neutron alignments\ncalculated at I \u223c 30h\u00af and 40h\u00af, respectively.

(Moment-of-inertia comparisons\nfrom UC calculations have not been reported for 175Hf [9].)\nIt is also notable that the TRS calculations, in contrast to\nthe UC calculations [9,13], give no potential-energy minimum\nat \u03b22 \u2248 0.45, \u03b3 \u2248 30\u25e6, for either negative- or positive-parity\nstates in 175Hf. (The shallow triaxial minimum that develops\nat \u03b22 \u2248 0.6 is far from yrast\u2014about 4.5 MeV above yrast\nat I = 50h\u00af.) The origin of this difference between TRS and\nUC calculations is a significant issue, and some comparison\nwith the situation in 163Lu is appropriate. The nuclide 163Lu\nhas probably the best-studied TSD structures, and the large\ndeformation was first associated with the proton 1\/2+[660]\nintruder orbital by Schmitz et al. [25,26] aided by TRS\ncalculations. Later, this potential-energy minimum was seen to\ncorrespond to a TSD minimum from UC calculations [27,28].\nHowever, the UC minimum was a little more deformed and\nmore triaxial (\u00062 \u2248 0.41, \u03b3 \u2248 21\u25e6) than the TRS minimum\n[26] (\u03b22 \u2248 0.37, \u03b3 \u2248 14\u25e6; note that \u00062 \u2248 0.94\u03b22). In the\npresent work, TRS calculations have been repeated for 163Lu,\nand these agree with the deformation values reported in\nRef. [26]. Indeed, we have performed TRS calculations for\nseveral nuclides in this mass region and find that 163Lu gives\nthe most favorable TSD minimum, especially at low rotational\nTABLE I.

Another favored case from the TRS calculations is\n165Ta.\nA further point of comparison concerns the collective oblate\nminimum. Although this is absent in 163Lu with both UC and\nTRS calculations, it is present in 175Hf with both calculation\nmethods. However, only with the TRS method is the oblate\nminimum in 175Hf found to become deep enough to be yrast,\nalbeit over a limited spin region.\nDetailed yet significant differences between the potential-\nenergy minima from UC and TRS calculations thus seem to be\npervasive and most likely arise from the mean-field potentials\nthemselves (Nilsson and Woods-Saxon, respectively, the latter\nbeing more realistic). These can affect, in particular, the\nrelative energies of the high-j intruder orbitals, which play\nkey roles in generating both rotation alignments and large\ndeformations. The different treatments of pairing correlations\nmay also play a role (cf. Ref. [27] for details of the UC\nmethod). The present work highlights the need for an improved\nunderstanding of these differences, but further analysis goes\nbeyond the scope of this Brief Report.\nAn important observable is the transition quadrupole\nmoment Qt , which can be estimated from the collective shape\nof the nucleus according to the \u201cmacroscopic\u201d formula\nQt = 6ZeA2\/3(15\u03c0 )\u22121\/2r20\u03b22(1 + 0.360\u03b22) cos(30\u25e6 + \u03b3 )\nwith radius parameter r0 = 1.20 fm [29]. This is called\nQmacro in the present work. However, it is known that, in\nprinciple, the quadrupole moments should be determined from\nthe \u201cmicroscopic\u201d wave functions (i.e., from the expectation\nvalues of the quadrupole operator using the calculated wave\nfunctions). This is what is done to obtain Qmicro in the present\nwork. The values are compared in Table I, which also includes\npreliminary experimental data [9,13]. It is evident that Qmicro\nis reasonably close to the experimental values (and closer\nthan Qmacro), lending support to the present interpretation.\nThe evaluation of Qmicro follows the method of Laird et al.\n[30] with Qmicro = Q20 +\n\u221a\n2\n3Q22. Table II gives additional\ndetails about the calculated shapes and quadrupole moments,\nincluding their variation with spin, which may be useful for\nfuture comparison with experimental data.\nIn summary, recent experimental results are compared\nwith TRS calculations, giving a good description of high-\nspin rotational bands in 175Hf. Collective oblate rotation\n(\u03b22 \u2248 0.23) is suggested to form the yrast structure at I \u223c 35h\u00af,\nbut this mode terminates in noncollective prolate states,\nand highly deformed (\u03b22 \u2248 0.36) collective prolate rotation\nbecomes yrast.\nWe would like to thank R.
