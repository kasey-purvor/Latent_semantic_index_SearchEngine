Rather than seeing knowledge as something that has only recently \nbecome relevant to economic performance and to understanding of the economy \nand economic development, I argue that knowledge is central to all economic \nactivity, and that different types of such activity draw upon and require different \ntypes of knowledge. \n \nIntroduction \n \nThere is widespread agreement that all economic activity \u2013 as purposeful human \nbehaviour \u2013 necessarily depends upon knowledgeable behaviour and intentional \nhuman action; without a knowledge base, such activity would clearly be \nimpossible. Thus an economy that is not based upon knowledge is, literally, \ninconceivable. The creation of knowledge has been integral to the development of \ncapitalist economies since they were first constituted as capitalist, as Marx and \nSchumpeter (among other political economists) emphasised. Much of the \nrevolutionary potential of capitalism has always rested in its capacity to create new \ncommodities and new ways of commodity production via successive radical \ntransformations of the forces of production and the labour process. Marxian \npolitical economy, conjoined with more recent approaches such as those of the \nFrench regulationists (for example, see Jessop and Sum, 2007), continues to \nprovide a powerful perspective thought which to understand the contemporary \n 3 \neconomy, especially in those versions of cultural political economy (for example, \nSum and Jessop, 2008) that seek more explicitly to incorporate consideration of \nissues of meaning and semiosis with more traditional concerns of commodity \nproduction and value. Such perspectives of Marxian political economy inform the \ninterpretative approach adopted in this paper approach  \n \nMuch has also been written in recent years about knowledge creation and transfer \nand related issues from more recent and different theoretical perspectives, such as \nthose of knowledge creation, learning and national and regional innovation \nsystems that place considerable weight upon knowledge and learning per se as \nsources of competitive advantage and economic success (LUNDVALL, 1992; \nNONAKA and TAKEUCHI, 1995). There are three main ways in which knowledge \nis now seen as more important in the economy. Firstly, there is greater emphasis \non knowledge per se as a commodified output, in part linked to the greater \nsignificance of symbolic products. Secondly, there is greater emphasis on \nincreasing the knowledge intensity of existing commodities, both material and \nimmaterial, shifting up the value chain towards more knowledge intensive \nactivities. And, thirdly, partly linked to this, are the increasingly blurred boundaries \nbetween material commodities and services produced via the interaction of people \nand things. \n \nInitially, influenced heavily by the experiences of parts of the USA, such as \nCalifornia and New England, and the advocates of the \u201etriple helix\u201f approach \n 4 \n(ETZKOWITZ and LEYDESDORFF, 2000) these placed most emphasis on flows \nof codified knowledge within formal organisational and institutional structures and \nupon links between \u201ehigh-tech\u201f industries and entrepreneurial Universities in the \ntranslation of scientific knowledge into innovative products and processes \n(LUNDVALL and MASKELL, 2000). However, later and more nuanced approaches \nplaced more emphasis upon tacit knowledge and the interactions and relationships \nbetween codified and tacit knowledges (for example, see AMIN and COHENDET, \n2003; ASHEIM and COENEN, 2005; JENSEN et al, 2007).  \n \nThis growing emphasis upon knowledge has been influential in shaping new \nconceptions of urban and regional development policy and strong claims have \nbeen made as to the potential of such developments for urban and regional \nregeneration, linking the knowledge-based competitive advantage of firms with that \nof territories defined at various spatial scales (BRACZYK et al, 1998; SIMMIE, \n1997). This draws attention to the significance of the place-specificity of processes \nof knowledge production and translation and the importance of tacit knowledge in \nenabling codified knowledge to be effectively deployed in the economy in place. \nThe successful economies of fin-de\u2013si\u00e9cle capitalism are seen to be those of \nterritories (cities, regions, national states) that, by good luck or judgment, have \nbecome constructed around activities grounded in valuable knowledges that can \nbe literally capitalised and become a source of profit. The future success of these \nterritories is seen to depend on the continuing production of new knowledge, \ntranslating this into innovative products and processes and maintaining first-mover \n 5 \nadvantages. This emphasis within policy discourse reflects perceived changes in \nthe ways that knowledge is now seen as important in the economy. The task of \npublic policy is then to try to ensure that the knowledge-based process of moving \nforward, ever onward and upward, is facilitated in successful places and that the \nlessons of their success are translated to unsuccessful places, in so far as this is \npossible within the parameters of capitalist social relations.  \n \nClaims about the emergence of new KBEs can therefore also be seen as \nrecognition that the knowledge bases of formerly successful economic activities \n(as registered in mainstream indicators of capitalist development) and the regional \neconomies that these helped constitute have been rendered redundant by \nsectoral, technological and spatial shifts in the capitalist economy. Consequently, \ncommodities that could once be profitably produced in a given place can no longer \nbe so. This recognises that the economy is knowledge-based but that capital \nvalorises some knowledges while devalorising others. Therefore, so the policy \nstory goes, it follows that reconstruction of the economies of places that have \nbecome unsuccessful requires shifting to new activities with different knowledge \nbases that can be successfully capitalised and valorised and learning from the \nexperiences of economic \u201ehot spots\u201f. It is this that is signalled by normative claims \nabout the perceived need to move trajectories and encourage and facilitate the \nemergence of a new KBE via specific forms of public policy that privilege particular \nsorts of knowledge and institutions in the creation and dissemination of that \nknowledge. In this, of course, there are two major assumptions. First, that the \n 6 \nbases of success of the \u201esuccessful places\u201f have been correctly analysed and \ndiagnosed in terms of the primacy of such knowledge as the main source of \ncompetitive advantage. Secondly, that the direction of the causal links between \ntheory and practice has been correctly specified. However, this is a matter of \ndebate \u2013 some see theory as shaping practice, others see theory as reflecting \npractice while others see links between the two as reciprocal and complex, not \neasily amenable to sweeping generalization, leaving  the issue of the effects of \npolicy unresolved (HUDSON, 1999; MORGAN, 1995; LOVERING, 1999). \n \nSeen in this context, the issues to be addressed in this paper can be re-stated in \nterms of a number of questions. First, and centrally, how have changing \nconceptions of the role of knowledge been reflected in successive strategies for \nregional development in north east England, and in particular in the recent turn to \nan explicitly knowledge-based economy? In turn, this requires some consideration \nof broader questions. What is the role of knowledge relative to other factors and \nprocesses as a source of competitive advantage? What is new and specific about \nthe role of knowledge at the leading edges of contemporary capitalist \ndevelopment? What sort of knowledge, development strategy and policies are \nrequired for what sort of economy? Indeed what may well be at issue is what we \nmean by the economy, what counts as \u201ethe economy\u201f, and how we conceptualise \nit. This may involve consideration not simply of the differing knowledge bases of \nvaried types of economic activity but more fundamental questions relating to \ndifferent concepts of value and processes of valuation within a more \n 7 \nheterogeneous and plural conception of what is to be counted as \u201ethe economy\u201f. \nBut this is to anticipate \u2026 \n \nIn this paper, therefore, and against the background of more general claims made \nabout the emergence of a new KBE (ALLEN, 2002; HUDSON, 2001; 2005; \nJESSOP, 2000; LEINBACH and BRAUN 2001),  I want to explore the changing \nrole of knowledge in the economy through the lens of the successive \ntransformations of a particular regional economy \u2013 that of north east England \u2013 \nand the successive conceptions of development policy that have been pursued \nthere and, if only implicitly for much of the time, shifting conceptions within policy of \nthe required knowledge base for that economy to prosper. The remainder of this \npaper falls into five sections. First, I consider in more detail some of the claims as \nto what is seen to be new in terms of knowledge and the new ways in which \nknowledge is now seen as economically significant. The next section considers the \nemergence and development of the north east region\u201fs economy from the \nnineteenth century, as a centre of radical innovation and knowledge creation that \nunderpinned its economic success. Thirdly, in response to the secular decline of \nthat economy from the late 1950s, I examine the emergence of an alternative \nbranch plant economy, with its very different requirements in terms of knowledge, \nand various alternatives that were explored to that largely unsuccessful \ndevelopment policy, such as the pursuit of endogenous growth through small \nfirms. Then, in recognition of the limitations of all these various policy options, a \nnew suite of policies that self-consciously sought to promote the emergence of a \n 8 \nnew and more managed KBE in the region began to appear from the 1990s. \nThese are considered in the penultimate part of the paper. Finally I reflect upon \nthis developmental and policy history and seek to draw some lessons from it.  \n \nSo what\u201fs new about knowledge in the \u201enew\u201f economy and the way we think about \nit now?  \n \nGiven that there is a general acknowledgment as to the importance of knowledge \nin the economy, why then the recent widespread fascination, even obsession, with \nknowledge-based economies (KBEs), both in academic discourse and \ndevelopment policies? What is seen now as novel about the role of knowledge in \nthe \u201cnew\u201d economy)?  What\u201fs all the fuss about? \n \nIn recent years the social science and business literatures have become replete \nwith claims as to the growing importance of knowledge and information flows in an \n(allegedly) weightless, de-materialised \u201cnew\u201d economy of informational capitalism \n(CASTELLS, 1996),  in particular in terms of the extent to which knowledge can be \ndigitised, commodified, and capitalised to underpin a new knowledge-based \neconomy.  There are strong claims to the effect that this new economy operates in \na complex, non-propinquitous, multidimensional cyberspace, with novel spatial \ndynamics grounded in the possibilities that cyberspace offers for simultaneous co-\nlocation of myriad entities and relationships (JESSOP, 2000, 4; see also \nLEINBACH and BRUNN, 2001).  Moreover, there is no doubt that there has also \n 9 \nbeen some growth in the importance of some sorts of knowledge and information \nin the economy in relation to material commodity production, to the production of \nhigh \u201flevel services, and to the production of a range of \u201esymbolic\u201f commodities.  \n \nThe selectively increased importance of flows of knowledge and information in \nsome sectors of capitalist economies has highlighted the importance of processes \nof knowledge creation and flows of information within firms via a range of types of \nlearning  (such as single and double loop) and ways of learning (by doing, by \nimitating, by watching, in working and so on). These become linked in inter-related \nand recursive ways so that learning and innovation involve complex circuits of \nknowledge and information rather than the linear flows of the hierarchical R&D \nmodel. The growing distanciation of many economic relations within an \nincreasingly spaced-out economy as the locations of activities both within and \nbetween firms become further separated by physical distance is made possible by \nincreasing digitalisation and other improvements in ICT and transport technologies. \nFlows of information both increase in volume and in distance travelled, as do flows \nof people as sites of embedded and tacit knowledges, in the process re-working \nthe meaning of work in the globalising economy (JONES, 2008). More generally, \nthere is evidence of the creation of new global circuits of intellectual capital \n(THRIFT, 2005).  \n \nRecognising these recent changes, it is nonetheless equally important to \nacknowledge that the economy has always depended on knowledgeable workers, \n 10 \nflows of knowledge and information and mixes of codified and tacit knowledge so \nthat claims as to the increased importance of flows of knowledge and information \nfor economic performance must be carefully qualified. What is at issue is the \nchanging significance of knowledge, the varying \u201emixes\u201f and types of knowledge, \nand the routes through which they flow into the production of any commodity. For \nexample, ALLEN (2002, 39-40, emphasis in original) emphasises \u201cthe symbolic \nbasis of all forms of economic knowledge\u201d. Furthermore, \u201cdifferent economic \nactivities play across a variety of symbolic registers \u2013 abstract, expressive, \naffective and aesthetic \u2013 and combine them in ways that render sectors \ndistinctive\u201d. Symbolic knowledge is not, therefore, confined to the production of \ncultural commodities, and it may have become relatively more important across a \nrange of other commodities. Conversely, producing symbolic outputs, as with \nservices, typically requires substantial material underpinning and infrastructure, not \nleast in creating specific settings to enable co-presence of producers and \nconsumers. For example, IT services require particular sorts of buildings, \ncomputers, network connections, electricity \u2013 which requires power stations, which \nin turn require coal, oil, nuclear fuel, or some form of fossil fuel generating \ntechnology. The issue here is the complex connections between different bits of \ncommodity production that allow the production of new \u201csymbolic commodities\u201d \nrather than the emergence of de-materialised commodities in a digititalised, \nweightless economy. The material basis and weight remain critical, albeit \ndistanciated from the particular sites from which flows of information and \nknowledge emanate.  \n 11 \n \nJESSOP (2000, 2) suggests that \u201cwhat is novel in the current period [of capitalist \ndevelopment] is the growing application of knowledge in developing the forces of \nproduction and the increased importance of knowledge as a fictitious commodity in \nshaping the social relations of production\u201d. For example, one indication of this is \nthe expanding volumes of patents awarded to companies involved in \nbiotechnology and bio-engineering, which are positioned at the forefront of the new \n\u201cknowledge economy\u201d in which \u201cinformation and ideas have become critically \nimportant economic assets\u201d (BOWRING, 2003, 118), At least three processes are \ninvolved in transforming knowledge into a fictitious commodity, altho8gh it is \nimportant to acknowledge that these are not new to a capitalist economy but that \nthey have increased in intensity and extent. These involve both qualitative \ntransformations and flows of knowledge between people, companies and other \norganisations involved in the economy. First, the formal transformation of \nknowledge from a collective resource (\u201eintellectual commons\u201f) into intellectual \nproperty as a basis for revenue generation (for example, as a licence or patent). \nSecondly, the formal subsumption of knowledge production under exploitative \nclass relations through the separation of intellectual and manual labour and the \ntransformation of the former into alienated wage labour, producing knowledge as \nan exchange value rather than as a use value. Thirdly, the real subsumption of \nintellectual labour and its products under capitalist control through their \ncommodification and integration into a networked, digitised production-\nconsumption process controlled by capital, of information produced by a firm not \n 12 \nfor its own use (as a use value) but to sell to another to deploy in its production \nprocess (as an exchange value).  \n \nThus the distinctive features of recent developments in circuits of knowledge and \nintellectual capital are seen to relate to their global reach and speed of flow within \nthem, changes enabled by technological innovations in ICT and the deployment of \ndifferent combinations of knowledge in commodity production as the role of \nknowledge in the economy has changed qualitatively. Paradoxically, however, the \ngreater fluidity in the movement of codified knowledge has enhanced the \nsignificance of tact knowledge and the key material sites in which it is produced \nand circulated. It is these changes in the movement of information rather than \nknowledge and learning per se becoming distinguishing features of the capitalist \neconomy that are crucial. There are, however, limits to such processes.  \nCyberspace is not a \u201cneutral third space\u201d between capital and labour, market and \nstate, public and private. Rather, it is a new terrain on which conflict between these \nforces institutions and domains can be fought out. Consequently, irrespective of \nthe extent to which capital migrates into cyberspace, like all capital \u201cit still depends \non territorialisation\u201d \u2013 that is, on materialisation in specific spaces, cities and \nregions. Indeed, \u201ceven e-commerce needs such an infrastructure, even if it \ninvolves a \u201ecelestial jukebox\u201f sending digitised music on demand\u201d (JESSOP, 2000, \n4). This in turn suggests that those cities and regions in which such activities have \nbecome materialised have become pivotal and will become of still greater \nsignificance in shaping the development trajectories of capitalist economies and in \n 13 \nreproducing the map of uneven development. This suggests that the extent to \nwhich peripheral places can gain as a result of the new developmental trends may \nbe severely circumscribed, In turn, this calls into question claims that such polices \nconstitute the panacea for the problems of such places.  \n \n \nThe Knowledge-based Economy, version I: the creation of a \u201eworkshop of the \nworld\u201f \n \nIt is often remarked that north east   England was once one of the \u201eworkshops of \nthe world\u201f, a region transformed in the nineteenth century into one of the \nbirthplaces of industrial capitalism, a major site of production for key commodities \nand raw materials of the era of carboniferous capitalism. This remarkable \ntransformation of  the region via the creation of a new form of economy was above \nall based upon invention, the creation of new knowledge, typically initially in the \nform of tacit knowledge as a result of the practical activities of engineers and \nworking men, and its deployment in production via a range of radical product and \nprocess innovations in chemicals, coal mining, the production and use of metals in \nmaking ships, armaments, power stations and equipment and other complex \ncommodities linked to the production of the means of production (MCCORD, 1979; \nNORTH, 1975).  \n \n 14 \nThus this emergence of new forms of economic activity based around radical \nproduct and\/or process innovations and their deployment in commodity production \nwas nothing less than the creation of a new KBE. Newly produced scientific \nknowledge was combined with existing knowledges, both codified and tacit, to \nform the epistemic basis of a new regional economy via translating new knowledge \ninto radical innovations. The interplay of codified and tacit knowledges, of new and \nexisting knowledges, and their resultant emergent effects, decisively shaped the \ncompetitive advantage of firms in the region. As such, the region became a pivotal \nlocation in the development of industrial capitalism, centred on major capitalist \nenterprises. These were typically linked into \u201ecoal combines\u201f via a variety of \neconomic and non-economic relations and ties and deployed strategies of strong \nSchumpeterian competition, based on first mover advantage and oligopolistic \nmarket domination, if not quite monopolistic control of markets (HUDSON, 1989). \n \nMoreover, this emergent KBE was based on a combination of endogenous capital \nand locally-produced knowledges with imports and inflows of both human labour \n(from Ireland and other regions of the UK), knowledge and raw materials (for \nexample, by the 1870s, iron ores from Spain: BEYNON et al, 1994) and resulted in \nsubstantial outflows and exports of commodities and capital to the markets of both \nformal and informal Empires. For example, around the turn of the twentieth \ncentury, around 80% of all capitalist ship production emanated from the region. In \nthese senses, it was from the outset a global region, deeply involved in the \nproduction of globalised relationships and global flows of capital. However \u2013 and \n 15 \nthis is a key point - all stages of the production process in these varied industries, \nfrom R&D and the production of knowledge and its translation into new processes \nand products to material commodity production, were located in the region which \nbecame, for capital at least, the centre of a virtuous spiral of accumulation and \ngrowth1. Moreover, high level scientific and technical knowledges to support such \nR&D activities were underpinned by the development of Durham University\u201fs \nactivities in Newcastle, as Armstrong College focussed on activities as \nengineering, with a direct feedback to the economy via the transfer of codified \nknowledge about production processes and products (pre-figuring proposals and \ndevelopments around a century later: see below).  \n \nThe depression of the 1920s and 1930s had severe impacts upon this \u201eold\u201f \nindustrial economy (\u201eold\u201f in the sense that it no longer enjoyed its former first-\nmover advantage as innovations had diffused internationally). Nonetheless, it \nmanaged to survive well into the 1960s, with a continuing although more selective \nand sporadic history of knowledge creation, R&D, and radical product and process \ninnovation (much of it associated with the activities of ICI on Teesside). The inter-\nwar depression was characterised by severe job losses but, in general (there were \nexceptions: colliery closures in west Durham and the closure of Palmer\u201fs Jarrow \n                                                 \n1\n Two qualifications are worth making regarding the growth process. First, there were often wild \ncyclical fluctuations around the upward trend. Secondly, the main beneficiaries of growth were \nlocal capitalists and their allies; working people and their families were commonly living in \npoverty, especially in cyclical downturns. \n 16 \nshipyard by National Shipbuilders Securities: see WILKENSON, 1939), it did not \nlead to large-scale capacity closure. While fixed capital was moth-balled and to a \ndegree devalorised, in general it was not physically and materially destroyed. \nConsequently, when demand recovered the region\u201fs industrial economy could \nrespond and revive in terms of output and employment, though less so in terms of \nfresh fixed capital investment In a way that typifies the contradictions of capitalist \ndevelopment, the regional economy was pulled from economic crisis by the \ncombined effects of the war economy and post-war reconstruction. As a result, the \nsclerosis that had set into much of the economy did not become visible in terms of \nindicators such as output, employment and unemployment until the late 1950s, \ninitially in coal mining and shipbuilding, but then in a progressively wider range of \n\u201ctraditional\u201d industries. \n \nHowever, the design and R&D teams of the major shipbuilding and engineering \ncompanies (for example, Swan Hunter and Reyrolle Parsons) and especially \nchemicals (ICI at Wilton alone employed more than 200 PhD research chemists) in \nthe region remained intact throughout this period; some even expanded. Indeed, \nthe concentration of highly qualified research chemists at ICI can be seen as \nemblematic of the way in which knowledge creation had become intentionally \ndesigned to underpin commodity production and the process of capital \naccumulation. Moreover, to the extent that knowledge became patented and \nlicensed to others, knowledge itself became capitalised, a commodity to be traded, \nbought and sold in markets. Nonetheless, in general this \u201eold\u201f industrial economy \n 17 \nhad lost its radical innovative edge and the competitive advantages once conferred \nby its distinctive knowledge bases.  \n \nThere were a number of reasons for this, related to private- and public-sector \ndecision-making processes. First, there were changes in corporate strategy: as \ncommodities became mature, companies either went out of business due to \nintensified global competition or switched product and\/or process and\/or location \nand moved their R&D and related activities out of the north east (a process that \nwas still continuing into the 1990s: PIKE, 2005). This locational switch was an \nintegral part of changes in the international division of labour, and the rise of new \nproduction centres in other parts of the world. Secondly, nationalisation led to the \ncentralisation of R&D in coal, energy and steel in locations outside the region. \nPrivatisation of formerly nationalised industries had the same effect: the move by \nnewly-privatised British Gas of its R&D activities from Killingworth to the south east \nin the 1990s was the last in a series of such relocations. One critical consequence \nof these moves was that the potential for translating high level knowledges and \nskills into new activities in the region and a resultant transformation of the regional \neconomy onto a new knowledge base was lost. \n \nInterestingly, however, in one or two rare cases such a transformation of existing \nfirms onto a new knowledge base did occur, registered in development discourse \nin the region (which is discussed more fully below) by recognition of the \nemergence of new clusters from the late 1990s. For example, on Tyneside this led \n 18 \nto the emergence of a sub-sea technology cluster, evolving from offshore activities \nthat in turn had developed from previous shipbuilding activity. A second example \nemerged in the Tees Valley, with a cluster of high-level globally competitive \nengineering service firms evolving from firms that previously had been builders of \nbridges, railways and related products but that now sell their knowledge and \nexpertise in design and project management in a global market. These \ntransformations are a product of the link between two sets of processes. The first \nrelates to the creation of \u201credundant\u201d or \u201cslack\u201d resources (human, technical and \ninfrastructural) left behind by the decline of traditional industries. The second \nfocuses on the processes of corporate and sectoral re-organisation, the \nidentification of new market opportunities, the selection of promising avenues of \ndevelopment, the organisation or creation of a new architecture of knowledge \nproduction and utilization and the discovery of new methods of production \norganisation to enable the emergence of a new technological and\/or market \ntrajectory to absorb this slack and put it to productive use.  \n \nWhile recognising the potential significance of these examples of successful \nadaptation for development strategies in the region, the fundamental point is that \nthese remain just that \u2013 rare examples of a counter-tendency2. The dominant \neffect of eroding the competitive edge provided by the knowledge bases that \n                                                 \n2\n There was no inevitability about this, however. In other similar regions such transformations \ntook place on a much larger scale. For example, in the Ruhr there a significant new cluster of \nenvironmental technology companies emerged from the declining coal and steel sectors. \n 19 \nunderpinned the growth of the region\u201fs \u201ctraditional\u201d industries is that of decline \u2013 in \ncapacity, output and jobs. This was disclosed and registered as a profound \nregional deindustrialisation, with all the socio-economic and political difficulties that \nit brought, Recognition of this led to attempts to create a different sort of regional \neconomy, with a different knowledge base. \n \nThe Knowledge-based Economy, version II: the branch plant economy and beyond \n \nAs the \u201cold\u201d knowledge-based economy began to exhibit signs of decline as early \nas the 1930s, , there were moves to develop new forms of state policy that would \nhelp construct an alternative form of economy based around inward investment in \n\u201enew\u201f \u2013 to the region - industries. This policy shift was initiated by established \ncapitalist concerns which sought to construct a state regional industrial policy to \nprotect their own interests and to counter the threat of social unrest as a result of \nrising unemployment and poverty. After a period of relative quiescence due to the \neffects of the war economy and post-war reconstruction in stimulating demand for \nproducts made in the north east, this policy of industrial diversification was \nprosecuted with renewed vigour from the late 1950s once it became clear that the \ndecline of the region\u201fs old industrial economy was secular rather than cyclical.  \n \nWhile a strengthened central government regional policy had been in place from \nthe late 1940s, it had been implemented very selectively and with little enthusiasm \nor vigour in the north east. Specifically, only branch plants and back office activities \n 20 \nthat would not compete on the labour market with established industries (coal \nmining, steel, shipbuilding and so on) were permitted to locate in the region \nbecause their outputs were seen as vital to post-war economic recovery and \nnational economic performance in the 1950s (HUDSON, 1989).  Blocking the entry \nof potential competitors for male labour was crucial in ensuring that their labour \nforces remained intact and production endangered by labour shortages. As a \nresult, such new branch plants as were permitted were concentrated in sectors \nsuch as clothing and consumer electronics, in which firms were primarily seeking \nto recruit female labour, while the expansion of public services such as education \nand health was also based upon enhanced female activity rates.  \n \nHowever, once the \u201cold\u201d industrial economy was seen to be in secular decline, \npolitical-economic priorities changed. Not only was there a perceived need for \nalternative sources of male employment in the north east but unbalanced regional \ngrowth became recognised as a major impediment to achieving faster non-\ninflationary national economic growth. The solution to these problems was seen to \nlie in a more vigorous implementation of a further strengthened central government \nregional policy, attracting new investment and jobs to the north east (and like \nregions), creating new sources of male employment there and reducing inter-\nregional differences in economic performance and growth rates.  \n                                                                                                                                            \nThe emphasis in building a new form of regional economy around branch plants to \na degree also reflected the emerging academic literature on corporate \n 21 \nreorganisation and the new ways in which companies were using spatial difference \nas part of their competitive strategies as new geographies of production and \nspatial divisions of labour were emerging. Regional policy sought to use this and \nattract particular routine branch plant functions to the north east. This new branch \nplant economy required different sorts of knowledge and skills, with little or no \ndemand for people with high level decision making, design and R&D skills. Instead \nit required people with more basic knowledge and limited qualifications but willing \nto accept the disciplines of Taylorised production in branch plants and back offices. \nThis was still a KBE, but one based upon the import of codified knowledges as to \nhow to organise routine production activities and requiring a limited range of skills \nand expertise within the region. Not only was there a much lower level of demand \nfor people with mental and non-manual skills but such manual jobs as were \nprovided were typically unskilled or semi-skilled and required different types of \nsocial and technical skills and competences to those of the \u201eold\u201f industrial \neconomy. As a result, there were often problems in getting men who had worked \nin coal mines, steel works, shipyards and engineering works \u2013 above all those \nengaged in skilled work, with occupationally specific skills, often based upon tacit \nknowledge acquired \u201eon the job\u201f -  to work on factory assembly lines in the new (to \nthe region) consumer goods component production and assembly plants, in the \npaper processing assembly lines of back offices, or in the new public service \nactivities of education and health, with their emphasis upon caring and cleaning \nwork. This was a key reason why this second version of a KBE in the region was \n 22 \nassociated with increased female employment and with feminisation and a shift in \nthe gender composition of the labour force.  \n \nThis shift in the industrial and occupational structure of the regional economy, and \nits enabling and requisite knowledge bases was also facilitated by a variety of \nstate-sponsored and\/or organised training schemes to ensure the availability of \nworkers with appropriate knowledge and skills.  While the skill levels required of \nthe \u201enew\u201f activities were generally modest, they were nonetheless skills (technical, \npersonal, social and communication skills) that were not readily available in the \nregion\u201fs labour market. Thus part of the offer to potential inward investors was that \ntraining would be provided to ensure that suitably qualified labour was available in \nsufficient quantity. This included specific training schemes for assembly line \nworkers in the new automobile and electronics companies and later for the \nsubstantial numbers recruited by a variety of call centres. However, the rigorous \nrecruitment criteria of the new companies, in a labour market in which supply far \nexceeded effective demand, meant that participation in these training schemes \nwas no guarantee of employment \u2013 for example, at one point in the early 1990s \nNissan had over 33,000 applications in response to advertising the availability of \n600 new jobs (HUDSON, 1995) 3. \n                                                 \n3 State training schemes were by no means new. Local technical colleges (and later \npolytechnics) provided courses for engineers and skilled manual workers required by the \n\u201eold\u201f industries. Training courses were organised in response to the requirements of \nearlier rounds of branch plant investment - for instance in consumer electronics in the \n 23 \n \nThe new manufacturing branch plants, increasingly a result of inward investment \nby multi-national corporations, were by-and-large demonstrably \u201eglobal outposts\u201f, \nsubject to capacity cutbacks or closure because of decisions taken in distant \nlocations, with often devastating effects in terms of job loss in the north east \n(HUDSON, 1995). Some closed very quickly, others never even opened (such as \nthe Siemens integrated circuit factory on north Tyneside), and on average the \nlifespan of branch plants shortened as more and more locations competed for \nthem. Despite claims about changes in the character of inward investment and the \nemergence of embedded branch plants, with deeper commitments to the region \nand wider mandates (for example, to include limited incremental R&D activity), in \npractice such plants are rare and hard to find.  While Nissan has been located in \nthe region for 20 years and elements of its supply chain have co-located in the \nnorth east, its factory at Washington New Town lost its mandates for R&D and \nsome aspects of purchasing following merger with Renault. Nissan is therefore \nboth a rare example of a plant that has remained for two decades, which sets the \nstandard in terms of labour productivity and product quality for other plants in \nEurope and north America and by the standards of the north east provides well-\npaid and stable manufacturing employment, but also one which has become less, \nrather than more, embedded with the passage of time. \n \n                                                                                                                                                 \n1960s (HUDSON, 1980). However, then, the probabilities of acquiring employment \nrequiring these newly-acquired skills were much higher.  \n 24 \nWhile public sector back office activities of government departments have proved \nrelatively stable, the later re-location of private sector back offices has exhibited \ngreater volatility. Equally, while there has been an influx of call centres and \nparticular types of business process activity across a wide range of sectors, these \ntoo are susceptible to closure and re-location in an intensely competitive global \nmarket as locations in Canada, China, the eastern l\u00e4nder of Germany, India and \nRussia seek to attract such labour-intensive (for now at least) activities. Although \nthese are mostly \u201cwhite collar\u201d non-manual jobs, they too require only basic \nknowledge, skills and competencies, with often a greater premium on \ncommunication, personal and social rather than technical skills.  \n \nBy the late 1970s it was becoming clear that the dominant policy approach of \nattracting inward investment was failing to provide an adequate answer to \nproblems of unemployment and lack of work in the region. The response to this \nwas to shift the emphasis in policy to encouraging endogenous growth and the \ncreation of self-employment in an emergent enterprise economy (HUDSON, 1998). \nThis spanned a range of manufacturing and service activities, including tourism \u2013 \nthe unifying factor seemed to be firm size rather than any more coherent shared \ncharacteristics. However, such a policy shift also valorised a new set of social and \ntechnical skills and competencies \u2013 summarised in terms of \u201centrepreneurship\u201d \nand \u201centerprise\u201d \u2013 but these proved to be in short supply in the region. Put another \nway, the policy switch to SMEs was predicated on untenable assumptions as to \nthe availability of particular sorts of knowledges and skills in the region \u2013 and was \n 25 \nsilent about the need to devise an appropriate demand\u2013side policy response. \nWhen this conception of policy failed in practice to produce economic \nregeneration, the stage was set for a different policy-led version of the KBE to \nemerge, centred on new forms of knowledge and sites of knowledge production, \ndiffusion and transmission. In this, the emergent regional policy was influenced by \ngrowing emphasis in parts of the social sciences on the (alleged) emergence of a \n\u201enew\u201f KBE and on the primacy of particular socio-spatial formations of this \neconomy. It was also influenced, decisively, by the dominance of neo-liberal \nperspectives on the economy that transcended party political divides and \nemphasised the role of competition, markets and self-reliance in shaping the fate \nof people and places  \n \n \nThe Knowledge-based Economy, version III: New Labour, regional devolution and \nnew science-based industries and knowledge transfer from the region\u201fs \nUniversities \n \nWhile the election of the New Labour government in 1997 in many ways was \nmarked by continuities with the neo-liberal policies of its Conservative \npredecessors, in other ways it registered important changes. In the context of \npolicies for the regions in general, and the north east in particular, these changes \nreflected the convergence of three different sorts of pressures, two \u201eeconomic\u201f and \nthe third \u201epolitical\u201f. First, there was recognition of a persistent national productivity \n 26 \n\u201egap\u201f, especially between the UK and USA, reflecting lower levels of R&D and high \nlevel \u201eknowledge-based\u201f activities. This was linked to policy makers\u201f changing \nunderstandings of the determinants of economic growth that placed greater \nemphasis on the quality of ideas, innovation and knowledge (for example, \nAGHION and HOWITT, 1998). This influenced national government policy and in \nturn filtered down to shape emerging conceptions of regional development policy \n(as is shown below). Secondly, there was recognition of continuing problems of \nregional uneven development as the north east persistently performed at the \nbottom of the regional economic performance league tables. This strongly \nsuggested that previous economic development models (in all their varied forms) \nsimply had not had, were not having and would not have their intended effects. \nThirdly, there were increased pressures for growing regional devolution in parts of \nboth central government and in some regions. These pressures were particularly \nprominent in the north east among certain business and political elites (and the \nreasons for this are discussed further below). The newly elected government saw \nthe possibility of dealing with all three sets of issues simultaneously via new \ninnovative devolved regional organisations in England, Regional Development \nAgencies (RDAs: the Celtic fringes had had their own stronger versions of such \ninstitutions for many years).  \n \nThe RDAs (along with appointed Regional Assemblies) were launched in the \ncontext of various national initiatives intended to help resolve the national \nproductivity problem via encouraging knowledge transfer from Universities to \n 27 \nregional economies and promoting an entrepreneurial culture in higher education \n(for example, establishing regional Science Enterprise Centres). This drew heavily \non one particular conception of scientific knowledge and its translation into the \neconomy (ETZKOWITZ and LEYDESDORFF, 2000; LUNDVALL and MASKELL, \n2000) and was a process that was to be heavily influenced in the north east by the \nsubsequent involvement of international consultants ADL (see below). Problems of \npoor regional economic performance were to be solved by, literally, capitalising \nand capitalising on knowledge produced in the regions\u201f Universities, facilitating the \nproduction of more knowledge intensive and higher value added commodities, \nprincipally in manufacturing but to a degree in services, reflecting the increasing \nde-differentiation of manufactures and services. Enhanced economic performance \nwould result from both capitalising upon on-going scientific research in universities \nand via specifically seeking to shape their research activities and agendas, \nespecially in science and engineering. This potentially raised difficult issues \nregarding the autonomy of universities and the determinants of research, the \nproduction of scientific knowledge and the ownership of IPR arising from that \nresearch. Implicit in this approach to economic development policy was a \nterritorially-based model of knowledge production and dissemination, centred on a \nconcept of regions as bounded and contiguous territories and regionally-defined \norganisational structures and intra-regional flows. Universities in the region \nresponded to these schemes (DUKE et al, 2006). Individually and collectively, \noften in collaboration with other regional partners, they explored ways to \nencourage knowledge transfer to companies and public sector organizations (such \n 28 \nas the NHS) in the region and commercialise the results of their scientific research. \nAt the risk of (over) simplification, these may be categorised as falling into one of \nfour types: research centres, collaboration and consultancy; intellectual property \n(IP) transactions; promotion of spin-offs, incubators, science parks; training and \nlabour mobility. \n \nWhile these national or UK\u2013wide initiatives evoked specific responses within the \nnorth east, they also created tensions, both nationally and specifically within the \nregion. The Treasury and Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) were primarily \nconcerned with productivity and national economic performance, seeking to use \nthese national initiatives to narrow the gap in productivity levels between the UK \nand its main international competitors and ease the transition to a high productivity, \nnew KBE. They saw the prime role of RDAs as the elimination regional productivity \ndifferentials and the barrier that these posed to non-inflationary national economic \ngrowth4. Not all central Government Departments saw the role of RDAs in this \nway, however. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM,) had a much \nstronger commitment to regional devolution per se, a cause. Long championed by \nthe \u201eOld Labour\u201f Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, whose 1983 alternative \nregional strategy was based upon greater regional devolution, regional \n                                                 \n4\n Those with a sense of history \u2013 and irony \u2013 pointed out that this was precisely the argument \nused in the 1950s by Macmillan\u201fs Conservative government to justify introducing a revived and \nstrengthened central government regional policy and soon afterwards specific initiatives for the \nnorth east of England: HUDSON, 1989.  \n 29 \ndevelopment agencies and elected regional authorities. As a result, there were \nvisible tensions within national government over the role of the new RDAs between \nthe Treasury\/DTI and the ODPM.  \n \nEqually within the region there were divisions between those who wanted such \ndevolved Agencies as part of a process of regional democratisation that would \u2013 \ninter alia \u2013 allow the formation and implementation of more effective regional \ndevelopment strategies and those who opposed them. These disputes reflected \ndifferent conceptions of \u201ethe region\u201f as a social actor, differences as to the \nappropriate site of policy formation, and divergent views as to which social \ninterests should be prioritised in regional development policies. The opposition was \nsomething of an unholy alliance, bringing together three distinct factions. Firstly, \nthose who opposed unelected RDAs because they were anti-democratic. \nSecondly, those who opposed the proposed form of elected RDA because it was \nsimply too weak to be effective (an offer decisively rejected in a regional \nreferendum in 2004). Thirdly, those who opposed an elected RDA because they \nsaw it as disrupting existing and well-established organisational arrangements that \noriginated in the 1930s and subsequently evolved into a succession of \norganisations \u201ein and for\u201f for the region These organisations were manned (the \nterm is deliberate) by groups drawn from a small political and economic elite and \n 30 \nserved their interests and those of their various constituencies (HUDSON, 1989; \n2006a; 2006b) 5 \n \nHowever, the establishment of the Regional Development Agency, (ONE), in 1999, \nwas a significant extension of past policies. Its main task was to forge a regional \neconomic strategy but within strictly defined parameters as to what constituted the \neconomy (\u201ethe capitalist mainstream\u201e), what constituted development (increases in \nproductivity and GDP\/caput) and as to the targets that had to be met and the tasks \nthat needed to be achieved to ensure this. These constraints were not unique to \nONE, applying to all the English RDAs. However, especially when combined with \nthe influence of a small set of consultants who tended to be involved in the \nproduction of these strategies and who were selling essentially the same generic \nmodel of development to all regions6, they led to the counter-intuitive result that \ntheir various economic development strategies bore a close generic resemblance \nto one another, despite the very different regional contexts that they were \nsupposedly addressing. As such, the creation of the RDAs and the ways in which \nthey were steered and monitored by central government can be seen as one \n                                                 \n5\n They included the Northern Economic Planning Council set up in 19966, the Government Office \nfor the North East (GONE), established in 1993 to bring together central government activities \nand operations and the delivery of central government policies in the region within a more \ncoherent framework and the appointed Regional Assembly created in 1999. \n6\n There are strong echoes here of THRIFT\u201fs (2005) emphasis on the significance of the global \n\u201ccircuit of cultural capital\u201d and of the pervasive influence of a small set of consultants and their \nassociates. \n 31 \nexpression of a new form of governmentality, of governing \u201eat a distance\u201f, \napparently devolving authority and power to regions but in practice tightening the \ngrip of the centre over the regions (HUDSON, 2007). \n \nThe emergent regional economic strategy in the north east had a clear and explicit \nfocus on promoting a new sort of KBE - in part a product of a recognition of the \ninadequacies of previous forms of policy, in part of a growing international \nemphasis upon a certain sort of \u201eknowledge-based economy as the route to future \nprosperity among international organisations such as the OECD and the EU with \nits Lisbon agenda. The region\u201fs universities were assigned \u2013 or, perhaps more \nprecisely, sought for themselves - a key role in this as important regional actors, \ncentres of research excellence and producers and disseminators of knowledge. \nUniversity laboratories were to become key nodes of \u201ehigh level\u201f knowledge \nproduction, predominantly in the form of codified knowledge, and its transfer to \nprivate sector companies and public sector organisations in the region. While \npartly a response to pressures from the universities, this was also a realistic \nreflection of the absence of feasible alternatives to fill this role as key nodes of \nknowledge production and dissemination. By the late 1990s there was very little \nprivate sector R&D activity left in the region and there were no major government \nor public sector R&D facilities there. The north east regional economic strategy \n(ONE, 1999; see also 2003) specifically focused on universities as the prime \nmechanism for rebuilding the knowledge base, identifying \u201ePlacing universities and \ncolleges at the heart of the Region\u201fs economy\u201f as one of six main priorities.  \n 32 \nHowever, there was no serious consideration of the knowledge transfer process, of \nthe necessary relations between codified and tacit knowledges in this process, and \nof how new codified knowledge would be used in combination with existing tacit \nknowledge. Rather it was simply assumed that the production of such knowledge \nin universities and its (non-problematic) translation into the regional economy as a \nsource of new products, processes and profits would act as a necessary - at times \nit even seemed sufficient \u2013 condition to set in motion a virtuous spiral of growth in \nthe region. As a result, putting the region\u201fs universities at the heart of the regional \neconomic strategy in this way was not without risks. From ONE\u201fs point of view it \nleft its economic development strategy \u2013 with its strong claim that it would generate \n90,000 jobs in the new KBE (whatever that in practice would mean) in ten years \u2013 \nheavily dependent upon universities filling their assigned role in circumstances in \nwhich they had little experience of, or track record of success in, such translational \nactivity. From the point of view of the universities, it created a weight of expectation \nas to their capabilities in knowledge transfer. Whether this was reasonable or \nrealistic remained unclear, not least because successive UK national Innovation \nSurveys reveal that only 2% of companies regard universities as a highly important \nsource of information (Miles and Daniels, 2007, 9).  Nonetheless, in the end, the \nKBE \u2013 or, more precisely, the specific form of its elaboration in ONE\u201fs strategy - \ncame to be seen as a politically neutral leitmotif to which all those in the region \nwho were \u201epartners\u201f in the strategy could sign up (after all, who could be against \nknowledge?). \n \n 33 \nThis still left unresolved the question of how to translate research from the \nuniversities to produce the desired regional KBE. In seeking to answer this \nquestion, the production of the regional economic strategy became linked into the \ndebate on \u201eclusters\u201f and the promotion of Porterian clusters as a key element in the \nprocess of knowledge transfer and successful regional economic development \n(although in fact ideas of cluster-based development were being floated in the \nnorth east in the 1960s: see HUDSON, 1989). Government White Papers in 2000 \nand 2001 emphasised the role of RDAs and of Universities in underpinning \neconomic vibrancy via support for clusters and innovation (DTI, 2000; DTI\/DfEE, \n2001), uncritically accepting claims that territorial clusters were the best \u2013 indeed \nthe only \u2013 feasible economic development model and failing to explore alternatives \nbased around different spatialities and forms of inter-firm relationships.  \n \nHowever, the question of which regional organisations could perform the role of \nbroker and translator of knowledge from universities to economy still remained \nunanswered. The 2001 White Paper proposed establishing University Innovation \nCentres (UICs). However, in parallel to these and other national initiatives and \nschemes, ONE set out to create its own set of new regionally-specific intermediate \norganisations as an integral component in its emerging regional economic \nstrategy.  Each English RDA was required to develop an innovation action plan as \npart of its initial guidance from government, building upon existing innovation \nstrategies developed through the government regional offices, often assisted by \nfunding from EU programmes. However, the resources available to support this \n 34 \nwere very limited (between \u00a3250k and \u00a3440k per RDA per annum) while RDAs \nwere highly constrained in their use of central government funds because funding \nstreams were locked into central government programmes delivered in the \nregions. Furthermore the legacy of historically low levels of government R&D \nexpenditure in the regions was seen as a key obstacle in moving towards a new \nKBE. As ONE (1999, 59) emphasized, \u201e[t]here is a widespread belief throughout \nthe Region that the Government must direct more Treasury funded research to \nUniversities outside London, particularly to the North East.  This is essential to \nunderpin the Region\u201fs approach to promoting knowledge transfer\u201f.   \n \nOne suggested approach to knowledge transfer was via Advanced Centres of \nExcellence (or Centres of Discovery), which like the, then new, International \nCentre for Life would combine research, exploitation, spin-offs, educational \noutreach, training and public understanding of science.  Four additional Centres \nwere proposed, but without specifying technology areas or delivery mechanisms or \nlocations. To help take forward the debate and clarify the potential role of such \nCentres, in early 2001 ADL was commissioned to review the research base in the \nNorth East in relation to current and future needs of key industry clusters. The ADL \nReport (August 2001) combined lessons learned from a parallel study in the North \nWest with refinement of previous work in the North East and  provided a clear \ntemplate for the region. The response to the report (ONE, 2001) was very rapid \u2013 \nindeed so rapid that it seems not unreasonable to assume that the response had \nalready been decided ahead of the report. Submitted to the DTI in September \n 35 \n2001It it incorporated most of ADL\u201fs recommendations.  The core of the \u201eStrategy \nfor Success\u201f was the formation of a Science and Industry Council (established in \nDecember), a regional exploitation agency NStar to provide access to finance, \nproof of concept investment and commercialisation advice and assistance and five \n\u201eCentres of Excellence\u201f, each to be established as non-profit companies and \nlocated in different parts of the region.  The five Centres would focus on life \nsciences (Centre of Excellence for Life Sciences - CELS), new and renewable \nenergy technologies (New and Renewable Energy Centre \u2013 NaREC), \nnanotechnology (Centre of Excellence for Nanotechnology, Photonics and \nMicrosystems - CENAMPS), digital technologies (Codeworks) and process \nindustries (Centre for Process Industries), this last based on the legacy of ICI\u201fs \nformer R&D activities on Teesside (see CHAPMAN, 2005) \u2013 a mixture of \ntechnologies novel to the region and existing regional industrial and academic \nstrengths.  .   \n \nThese five Centres of Excellence were intended to link the region\u201fs universities\u201f \nresearch base \u2013 concentrated in Durham University and the University of \nNewcastle - to business, forming a bridge between their scientific research and \nindustrial commercialization and the capitalisation of knowledge produced through \nresearch, while also recognising the need to forge extra-regional links.  ONE \nprovided pump-priming resources but each Centre was required to plan for self \nsufficiency from commercial and investment income within five years. Whether \nprioritising short-term concerns with financial self-sufficiency over longer-term \n 36 \nconcerns with qualitative regional economic transformation was realistic and \nsensible remains a moot point. Overall it was estimated that the RDA would invest \n\u00a3200 million over five years while aiming to leverage a similar level of investment \nfrom EU and other national programmes (ONE, 2003).  Each Centre evolved a \ndistinct strategy, reflecting the characteristics of the technologies and sectors it \nsupported and the legacies of existing Centres and activities. In addition Nstar \nsought to invest \u00a333m in innovative technologies through proof of concept funding. \nHowever, in total and in relation to the task of shifting the regional economy onto a \nqualitatively different developmental trajectory, this was very modest funding.  \n \nFollowing an appraisal of the Strategy for Success by the Regional Assembly in \nsummer 2004 as part of its \u201escrutiny\u201f role, ONE reviewed the programme, \nidentifying three Centres as presenting the greatest potential for future economic \ngrowth. Accordingly, the programme was restructured around the three \u201epillars\u201f of \nHealthcare, Process Industries and Energy and Environment, associated \nrespectively with CELS, CPI and NaREC. Each pillar was to be directed by a \nLeadership Council, responsible for setting a strategic vision and overseeing \ndelivery of the project, and incorporate industrial clusters and other \u201edelivery \npartners\u201f (including universities). ONE anticipated that each pillar could potentially \ncontribute \u00a32bn towards closing the North East\u201fs perceived \u00a39bn productivity gap. \nThe remaining two Centres (CENAMPS and Codeworks), along with NStar, the \nNorthern Way Design Centre (see below) and a management skills programme \nprovided via the Regional Skills Partnership, were to have more of a generic \n 37 \nunderpinning and complementary role, supporting activity across the three sectoral \npillars. Reflecting its aim that the Pillars should become self-financing, ONE \nproposed a two tier structure, with their public duty elements of activity financed by \nthe Agency, and the remaining income generating elements run through a \nseparate trading arm, responsible for commercialisation. \n \nThe emergence in 2004 of the Northern Way growth strategy involved ONE in \ndiscussions with two other RDAs (the North West and Yorkshire and Humberside) \naround a wider pan-regional strategy for investment in science in collaboration with \neight research-intensive universities in the North, known as the N8. However, the \nscale of additional funding was again modest \u2013 a \u201cgrowth fund\u201d of \u00a3100 million over \nthe period 2005-2008 spread across the three RDAs, with only \u00a310 million targeted \nat knowledge transfer and science and innovation priorities (NORTHERN WAY, \n2005). Clearly there is limited scope for new initiatives within these budgetary \nlimits. In addition, Newcastle was one of three cities were designated as science \ncities. The RDA, Newcastle City Council and Newcastle University acquired a \ndevelopment site, \u201escience central\u201f, near to the University and  intended to be a \nnew translational research campus, grounded in a place-bound concept of \n\u201escience city\u201f.  This, however, generated visible tensions between those who saw \n\u201escience city\u201f in this way, eliding it with \u201escience central\u201f, and those who envisaged \n\u201escience city\u201f as a distributed regional network, encompassing other key nodes of \nscientific knowledge production and research, both new (such as NETPark in \n 38 \nCounty Durham) and more established (such as CPI on Teesside, which merged \nwith CENAMPS in 2007),  \n \nHow successful these various initiatives will be in facilitating the emergence of a \nnew KBE and closing the inter-regional output   remains to be seen. There is some \ninitial evidence of the \u201epillars of excellence\u201f developing as nodes in knowledge \nflows (TULLY et al, 2006) and innovative firms in the north east being more likely \nto exploit contacts with Universities as compared to other English regions \n(Johnson and Reed, 2008, 24-5) but this is some way from the effective translation \nof results from scientific research into the cognitive basis of a \u201enew\u201f regional KBE. \nHowever, there are continuing uncertainties as to the development of \u201escience \ncentral\u201f and the time frame in which this might happen and, more generally, it \nremains to be seen how effectively \u201escience city\u201f as well as the \u201epillars of \nexcellence\u201f will evolve as mechanisms for delivery of the transition to a new \nregional KBE. Moreover, influential analysts have cast doubt on the wisdom of \nrelying on developing new industries on the basis of new knowledge and novel \ntechnologies, seeing it a high-risk and likely to fail and arguing for a different \nstrategy that sought to build more upon the legacies of previous versions of the \nKBE (OECD, 2006).  \n \nConclusions and Some Questions \n \n 39 \nBy the 1990s it was abundantly clear that the various policies pursued in the north \neast had failed to have their intended effects, of producing a stronger, more \ndiversified and resilient regional economy. The region continued to bump along at \nthe bottom of league tables of regional economic performance, with persistent high \nlevels of multiple deprivation and sharp intra-regional socio\u2013spatial disparities in \nwell-being. This encouraged \u2013 some might say politically necessitated \u2013 an urgent \nsearch for fresh policy approaches. Clearly the policy initiatives at both national \nand regional levels since the late 1990s, heavily influenced by new claims as to the \nsignificance of knowledge of particular sorts in shaping success in the \ncontemporary economy,  represent an ambitious attempt to remedy the situation \nand shift the region\u201fs economy onto a qualitatively different developmental \ntrajectory, seeking both to position the region more advantageously in relation to \nthe (allegedly) emergent \u201enew\u201f economy while echoing its nineteenth century \n\u201egolden age\u201f but on the basis of a much more consciously managed process of \nknowledge production and translation. The aim is to facilitate the production of new \ncommodities, with unique selling points and dominant market positions, and\/or to \nenhance the knowledge intensity and move up the value chain in producing \nexisting commodities via capitalising (on) knowledge produced in the region\u201fs \nuniversities and translated through new intermediary organisations, the \nCentres\/Pillars of Excellence.  \n \nThe success or otherwise of these initiatives raises important questions. First, are \nthey working \u2013 or will they work in future \u2013 in their own terms, to meet their defined \n 40 \ngoals? The answer to these questions remains as yet uncertain. Not least, this is \nbecause knowledge, no matter how original and novel, remains only one \ndeterminant of successful commodity production, corporate profitability and \nsuccessful regional regeneration and too much weight may be being loaded onto \nknowledge per se as an agent of economic transformation. While there have been \nsome promising signs, it is by no means certain that this developmental strategy \nwill succeed. It is, for example, difficult to see that it will meet the target of 90,000 \njobs to be created in the new KBE and questions remain as to whether the region\u201fs \nuniversities will be able to perform the key role of nodes of research, knowledge \nproduction and dissemination assigned to them. There will undoubtedly be \nknowledge transfer from the universities but it remains to be seen whether this will \nbe on the scale required to transform the regional economy \u2013 not least because of \nlack of demand and the limited capacity of the region\u201fs economy to absorb such \nnew knowledge and associated innovations. Moreover, there are unresolved \ntensions between the production of scientific knowledge as a research goal per se \n\u2013 which may then open opportunities for commercial exploitation, or then again \nmay not - and the consumption of such knowledge production to the pressing \nimperatives of capital. In short, it remains an open question as to whether the \ncurrent round of policies in the north east will have their intended effects in \nfacilitating the emergence of a KBE, especially as they are based in a limited and \npartial \u2013 even na\u00efve \u2013 view of the knowledge transfer process (see also OECD, \n2006). For as Miles and Daniels (2007, 21) note, \u201cIncreasingly it is not individual \ncompanies that compete but trans-border supply chains of integrated companies \n 41 \npositioned in global markets. In the face of such massive unbundling\u201f, whither a \nnational innovation strategy (let alone a regional strategy)?\u201d This clearly calls into \nquestion the efficacy of territorially- bounded innovation strategies.  \nSecondly, the region is seeking to pursue these policies in an increasingly \ncompetitive global environment, as cities, regions and national states all compete \nfor investment. Many places that have gone through the same sequence of growth \nand decline as north east England are now seeking to develop knowledge-based \neconomies, centered on the same restricted set of high technology activities and \nsectors. The pursuit of science-based \u2013 even science led - investment in sectors \nsuch as biotechnologies and nanotechnologies is rife. However, these are also \nbroad and diverse sectors of activity. One implication of this is that \u201cthe way \nforward is to nurture \u201eniche positions\u201f\u201d (Miles and Daniels, 2007, 4). Consequently \nthere is a need to identify precise niches and spheres of activity in which \ncompanies in north east England could, in principle at least, develop first mover \nadvantage and significant competitive advantage and then to develop equally \nprecisely targeted strategies to support their further successful development. \nThere are one or two of initiatives that suggest developments along these lines. \nThe first is the North East Stem Cell Institute (NESCI) is a unique interdisciplinary \ncollaboration between Durham and Newcastle Universities, the Newcastle \nHospitals NHS Foundation Trust, the International Centre for Life in Newcastle and \nONE NorthEast. It seeks to underpin cutting-edge research in stem cell biology \nand translate the results of this research into cost effective and ethically robust \nhealth solutions to ameliorate degenerative diseases, the effects of ageing and \n 42 \nserious injury. This in turn will provide a potential basis for commercialisng the \nresults of research and provide the basis for the emergence of innovative new \nproducts and services in which firms in the region will have first-mover advantage7. \nA second example is the Plastics Electronics Technology Centre (PETeC) at the \nNorth East Technology Park (NETPark) in County Durham.  Following its merger \nwith CENAMPS in 2007 and working in collaboration with multinationals and \nleading research bases, and both drawing on and facilitating cutting-edge research \nin the region\u201fs Universities, the Centre for Process Innovation (CPI) is establishing \nPETeC as an internationally recognised facility for the development and \ncommercialisation of printed electronic devices and flexible functional \nmaterials. Plastic electronics will form the basis for a completely new range of \napplications across a broad set of markets including electronic consumer goods, \nautomotive, aerospace, energy, retailing, food packaging, imaging, healthcare \nand fashion. Potential applications include smart packaging, real-time \nnewspapers, intelligent signage, point-of-care medical diagnostic devices, novel \ndrug delivery devices, smart sportswear, fashion clothes and accessories, printed \nelectronics for consumer products, flexible solar cells and solid state lighting. \nProviding world-class facilities, services and expertise at the hub of a UK-wide \nnetwork in plastic electronics, PETeC is becoming the national prototyping \noperation for these emergent new materials. It will establish the region as a \nglobal leader in the application of plastic electronics and will enable the \ndevelopment of internationally competitive, knowledge intensive activities, with \n                                                 \n7\n For further information, see http:\/\/www.ncl.ac.uk\/corporate-web-development\/about\/item\/nesci \n \n 43 \nthe potential for both new and established firms in the north east to derive first-\nmover advantage in these innovative new materials and products manufactured \nfrom them.  \nHowever, this degree of sophisticated targeting has not, as yet, developed more \ngenerally; nor have its wider implications been thought through in a systematic \nway. For example, it could have important implications for the types of university \nresearch that would be supported \u2013 and for those that would not be, with potential \nlonger-term dangers of narrowing the gene pool in terms of the diversity of \nresearch in universities. Moreover, even if there was to be this degree of \nsophisticated targeting, it is important to remember that these policy-led attempts \nto both use the results of existing university research in regional innovation \nstrategies and indeed shape such research in future so that it is directly linked to \nthe needs of capital are constrained within the parameters and limits defined by \ncapitalist relations of production. Consequently, there are precise limits to such \nprocesses, circumscribed by the limits to capital itself (HARVEY, 1982; JESSOP, \n2000) and by the limits to political strategies that seek to influence the form of \ncapitalist development, which remains inherently and unavoidably uneven. \nSeeking to commodify existing knowledge and\/or to produce future knowledge in \ncommodity form cannot escape the contradictions inherent to processes of \ncapitalist development and commodity production. Two are of particular relevance \nhere: first, such development typically has unintended as well as \u2013 or instead of \u2013 \nintended results; secondly, such development is dynamically uneven and typically \nerodes the bases of its success over the longer-term. This is something that \n 44 \nproponents of approaches that prioritise knowledge, information flows and learning \nper se are prone to ignore. \n \nThirdly, however, if the strategy does succeed in facilitating the emergence of a \nnew KBE that, for a while, is both quantitatively and qualitatively significant in its \ntransformative effects on the regional economy, there are two qualifications to be \nborne in mind. The first is that the historical-geography of the north east economy \nsuggests that even when there was substantial indigenous R&D activity in the \nregion, this was no guarantee of continued long-term economic success in\/of the \nregion. Profits made in the region were invested elsewhere, in other places and \nsectors (for example, railways in south America and banks in London). As the \nminers\u201f checkweighman George Harvey put it in 1917, \u201ccapital knows no county\u201d; \nno doubt if he were to come back now, he would emphasise that capital knows no \ncountry, indeed no continent. The second qualification is that even a successful \nKBE as envisaged within current policy discourse regionally and nationally would \nfail to engage large numbers of people in the region, for two reasons: first, it would \ngenerate insufficient jobs relative to the number of people seeking work; second, \nthere would be great selectivity on the part of employers as to who would get those \njobs. This strongly suggests the need for a more plural and heterogeneous \nconception of the economy, of development and of relevant knowledges in the \ncontext of a regional development strategy in the north east (and like regions). \nThese are essentially theoretical tasks but the key issue is not so much re-\ntheorisations per se (vital though that is) but rather which theoretical conceptions \n 45 \nbecome dominant \u2013 even hegemonic \u2013 in policy discourse and practice and in \npolitics. Most fundamentally, there needs to be acceptance of a broader \nconception of the KBE to encompass a wider range of activities and valorise a \ngreater range of knowledges. There is a pressing need to recognise that all forms \nof economic activity are knowledge-based and to embrace a more heterodox and \nplural concept of the economy, to acknowledge that there is \u2013 of necessity \u2013 still a \nplace for the branch plant economy alongside an emergent more sophisticated \n\u201eknowledge based\u201f economy. More than that, however, it is vital to acknowledge \nthe presence of a social economy and an informal economy that will be crucial to \nany sustainable development strategy for the north east since the scale of \nemployment creation in the formal economy, whether in its branch plant or \n\u201eknowledge-based\u201f variants, will simply be insufficient to absorb all those seeking \nwork in the region. There is some evidence of growing recognition of such points in \nONE\u201fs evolving approach to its regional development strategy although it remains \nuncertain as to how much weight will in practice be attached to such concerns. \n \nFinally, although the empirical focus in this paper has been upon the experiences \nof one region, north east England, this raises broader questions as to how different \nregions relate to and are positioned in the inherently uneven process of capitalist \ndevelopment and the changing knowledge bases and requirements of its leading \nedges.  For however much the emphasis switches to the significance of flows of \nknowledge in cyberspace as underpinning economic success and a resulting \nmigration of capital into cyberspace, like all capital \u201cit still depends on \n 46 \nterritorialisation\u201d (JESSOP, 2000, 4) \u2013 that is, on materialisation in specific cities \nand regions, which compete to be the sites of such materialisation and \nterritorialisation. Thus many other regions with economic histories similar to that of \nnorth east England are pursuing similar policies to create new knowledge based \neconomies \u2013 all believing that this will enable them to shift onto the high road of \neconomic success, emulate the processes of self-reinforcing endogenous growth \npresent in the key nodes of the global economy, and break with their peripheral \nstatus. Put another way, the assumption is that all regions will be able to engage in \n\u201ewin-win\u201f scenarios. Some may indeed succeed in making this transition. However, \nas the history of north east England shows only too clearly, this is a far from easy \ntask. Moreover, it is difficult to see how all can be winners in a capitalist economy \nthat continues necessarily to be characterised by combined and uneven \ndevelopment. There are therefore clear limits to the new knowledge based \neconomy \u2013 as there were with previous generations of regional policies - in \naddressing issues of uneven development.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis paper is a revised version of one first given at the AAG 2006 Annual \nConference in Chicago and draws on research into the transformation of the \neconomy of north east England, and of development policies in and\/or for the \nregion, over a period of some 30 years. However, the account of the period since \n1997 draws heavily on the results of a research project on knowledge transfer in \n 47 \nthe region funded by the Cambridge-MIT Initiative and I am particularly grateful to \nmy two co-researchers on this project, Brian Tanner and Janet Tully.
