Med. Biol.\n1. Introduction\nIt has long been known that the heart of a healthy human subject in repose does not\nbeat regularly. The rhythmic variation in the heart rate occurring at the frequency\nof respiration is known as sinus respiratory arrhythmia (see e.g. Stefanovska (2002)\nor Eckberg (2003) and references therein); it is not the only source of arrythmia\n(Stefanovska and Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 1999). In fact, at least five characteristic frequencies can be\n\u2016 To whom correspondence should be addressed (p.v.e.mcclintock@lancaster.ac.uk)\nPublished in Phys. Med. Biol. 49, 4407-4425 (2004).\nNonlinear cardio-respiratory interactions 2\nseen in blood flow signals, at \u223c1Hz, 0.3Hz, 0.1Hz, 0.04Hz and 0.01Hz. The first two\ncomponents correspond to the cardiac and respiratory oscillators respectively. The\ncomponent at \u223c0.1 Hz is often attributed to intrinsic myogenic activity. The other\ntwo correspond respectively to neurogenic and endothelial related metabolic activity.\nThe wavelet transforms of such signals have been discussed in detail (Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 and\nStefanovska 1998, Stefanovska et al. 1999, Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 and Stefanovska 1999).\nThe cardiac and respiratory systems can be perceived from the nonlinear\ndynamics point of view as coupled autonomous oscillators, each with its own\ncharacteristic frequency (Stefanovska and Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 1999, Stefanovska et al. 2001a). It\nis respiratory sinus arrhythmia \u2013 the rhythmic fluctuations of electrocardiographic\nR-R intervals, or the rhythmic modulation of the instantaneous cardiac frequency\n\u2013 that provides the most obvious manifestation of their coupling. Although the\ninteraction between the cardiac and respiratory rhythms has been known to exist\nsince the early works by Hales (1773) and Ludwig (1847), the underlying physiological\nmechanisms are not completely understood. In his recent review Eckberg (2003)\ndiscusses several possible mechanisms for respiratory gating, of both central and\nperipheral origin: central, secondary to efferent respiratory motoneurone activity; and\nperipheral, secondary to afferent neural activity from pulmonary and thoracic stretch\nreceptors. He presents a wide range of evidence favoring the influence of respiration on\nR-R interval fluctuations (as well as on the fluctuations in systolic blood pressure that\nare strongly correlated to the R-R fluctuations), rather than the influence of peripheral\nbaroreceptor physiology as an origin of modulation. As the physiological mechanisms\nof cardio-respiratory coupling are not fully understood, even less is known about the\nnature of this coupling, e.g. whether it is linear, quadratic or even of higher order.\nIn addition to the modulation, a mutual adjustment of the cardiac and respiratory\nrhythms may occur, leading to their synchronization: in a conscious healthy subject\nat rest, the cardiac and respiratory systems have been shown to synchronize for\nshort periods of time (Scha\u00a8fer et al. 1998, 1999, Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 Lotric\u02c7 and Stefanovska 2000).\nThe state of the system is characterized by the interactions and couplings between\nthe oscillatory physiological processes. For instance, in anaesthesia the cardiac and\nrespiratory systems synchronize for more extended periods of time (Stefanovska et al.\n2000). A long-term aim is therefore to develop a coupled oscillator model that can\nprovide a description of the system, quantifying the couplings and relating their\nvalues to its different states of health or disease. We may thus aim for improved\ntechniques of early diagnosis, better assessment of the efficacy of treatment for a\nrange of cardiovascular diseases, and perhaps quantification of depth of an\u00e6sthesia.\nThe interactions can be detected by analysis of recorded time series, and their\nstrength and direction can also be determined (Schreiber 2000, Rosenblum and\nPikovsky 2001, Palus\u02c7 et al. 2001, Rosenblum et al. 2002, Palus\u02c7 and Stefanovska 2003).\nThe next logical step in studying interactions among the coupled oscillators must be\nto determine the nature of the couplings from the time series.\nJams\u02c7ek et al. (2003) succeeded in extending bispectral analysis to encompass\ntime dependence, and demonstrated the potential of the extended technique to\ndetermine the type of couplings among interacting nonlinear oscillators. Time-phase\ncouplings can be observed by calculating the bispectrum and adapted bispectrum,\nthereby obtaining the time-dependent biphase and biamplitude. The method has the\nadvantage that it allows an arbitrary number of interacting oscillatory processes to\nbe studied. It is applicable both to univariate data (a single signal from the coupled\nsystem), and to multivariate data (a separate signal from each oscillator).\nNonlinear cardio-respiratory interactions 3\nIn the present paper, we apply the new technique to univariate cardiovascular\n(CV) blood flow signals that reflect the activities of both the local and central\nmechanisms of cardiovascular regulation. The heart\u2019s pumping action is manifested\nin every vessel, including the microcirculation. Peripheral blood flow is controlled\nby both extrinsic (central) and intrinsic (local) mechanisms, and so must reflect the\nactivities of both the local and central regulatory mechanisms (Stefanovska and Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7\n1999, Stefanovska et al. 1999, Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 et al. 2000, So\u00a8derstro\u00a8m et al. 2003). In section\n2 we summarize how measurements are made and discuss how the resultant data are\nanalyzed. Results are presented in section 3, and are discussed in section 4, where it\nis shown that the cardiac and respiratory processes can be nonlinearly phase coupled.\nFinally, in section 5, the work is summarized and conclusions are drawn. Details of the\nnormalization techniques used for comparison of the different measurements are given\nin Appendix A, and an analysis of harmonic generation by a pair of weakly-coupled\nweakly-nonlinear oscillators is presented in Appendix B.\n2. Data acquisition and analysis techniques\nThe interaction between two harmonic components can in practice contribute to the\npower at their sum and\/or difference frequencies. We assume that the cardiac and\nrespiratory oscillators are weakly coupled and can interact with each other nonlinearly.\nThe coupling is assumed to be weak in part because of the transient\/episodic character\nof cardio-respiratory synchronization in healthy subjects; the assumption of weak\nnonlinearity is on account of several factors including the lack of combinatorial\ncomponents near the cardiac frequency. We return to these questions and discuss them\nin more detail at the end of section 4.2. A quadratic interaction will give rise to higher\nharmonic components with frequencies 2f1, 2f2, f1 + f2 and f1 \u2212 f2, in addition to\nthe characteristic frequencies (Fackrell 1996). As well as having a particular harmonic\nstructure, the components also have phases that are related, 2\u03c61, 2\u03c62, \u03c61 + \u03c62 and\n\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62.\nAs discussed in detail by Jams\u02c7ek et al. (2003), the bispectrum quantifies\nrelationships among the underlying oscillatory components of the observed signals.\nSpecifically, bispectral analysis examines the relationships between the oscillations at\ntwo basic frequencies, f1 and f2 and a modulation component at the frequency f1\u00b1f2.\nThis set of three frequencies is known as a triplet (f1,f2,f1 \u00b1 f2).\nA high bispectrum value at bifrequency (f1, f2) indicates that there is at least\nfrequency coupling within the triplet of frequencies f1, f2, and f1\u00b1f2. Strong coupling\nimplies that the oscillatory components at f1 and f2 may have a common generator,\nor that the cardiovascular circuit they drive may, through a non-linear interaction,\nsynthesize a new, dependent component at frequency, f1 \u00b1 f2.\nNonlinear transformation causes the appearance of self-coupling peaks in the\nbispectrum (Nikias and Petropulu 1993, Zhou and Giannakis 1995). In periodic\nsignals, peaks at the self-frequency without self-phase couplings are common. Again,\nthe simultaneous appearance of both couplings is a very strong indicator of the\npresence of nonlinearity.\n2.1. Measurements\nThe data acquisition techniques have already been described (Stefanovska and Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7\n1999) but, in summary, were as follows. A four-channel laser Doppler blood flow\nNonlinear cardio-respiratory interactions 4\nmonitor (floLAB, Moor Instruments Ltd., UK) was used for simultaneous recordings\nof blood flow at the four different sites: both arms (left and right caput ulnae) and\nboth legs (left and right medial maleollus). Skin over bony prominences was chosen\nin order to standardize the measurement sites for the four extremities. A standard\ncalibration (flux standard) of all the probes was made in order to be able to compare\nsignals, and the blood flow was expressed in arbitrary units (AU). The electrical\nactivity of the heart (ECG), respiration and blood pressure were also simultaneously\nrecorded. The respiratory effort was measured using the TSD101B Respiratory\nEffort Transducer (Biopac Systems, Inc., USA). It consists of a piezoresistive sensor\nequipped with a silicon rubber strain assembly that measures the change in thoracic\nor abdominal circumference. The electrical conductivity of the sensor is proportional\nto the increase of abdominal circumference. The blood pressure was also measured\nwith a piezoelectric transducer, and the ECG was recorded using a standard technique\nwith two electrodes placed on the shoulders and one below the heart.\nSix males aged 25\u201327 years with no history of cardiopulmonary disease\nparticipated in the study. Each of them lay in repose on a bed for 15 minutes\nbefore the start of data recording. One set of measurements was taken in the normal\nrelaxed state, with spontaneous breathing, and a further two\/three measurements\nunder differently paced breathing. The duration of the measurements was 20 min\nfor spontaneous breathing, and 12 min for paced breathing. Blood flow signals were\ndigitized with 16-bit resolution and sampled at 40Hz, whereas the ECG, respiration\nand pressure signals were sampled at 400Hz. The paced respiration frequency was\nheld constant during the measurement of a given time series and the rhythm was\npaced by metronome. Altogether 22 recordings were made, as summarized in Table\n1.\n2.2. Data analysis\nThe blood flow signals were first pre-processed. Both very low and very high\nfrequencies were removed by use of moving average windows: drift with a 200 s long\nwindow; and high frequencies with a 0.2 s window while, and at the same time, the\nsignal was resampled to 10Hz. By using the moving average before resampling, we\navoid problems of aliasing. In addition, each signal was normalized to lie between zero\nand one, and its mean value was then subtracted. The characteristic cardiac f1 and\nrespiratory f2 frequencies, and their components at harmonically related positions,\nwere identified: for each signal, the power spectrum was computed to identify f1 and\nf2, and to detect those components possibly caused by nonlinear interactions, 2f1,\n2f2, and f1\u00b1 f2. Then the bispectrum was calculated. For each time series the signal\nwas divided into several segments and to ensure stationarity the average value within\neach window was also subtracted. The chosen window length affected both frequency\nresolution and the statistical stability of the estimates. Because of the finite length\nof the time series, optimal choice of the number of segments requires a measure of\ncompromise: the more segments the better the estimates, but increasing the number\nof segments also reduces the length of individual segments which, in turn, reduces the\nfrequency resolution. To obtain reliable estimates 30 or more segments are necessary\n(Jams\u02c7ek et al. 2003). The compromise can be optimised by an appropriate overlapping\nof the segments (see below).\nIn the case of quadratic coupling, for which we wish to test, several peaks occur\nin the bispectrum. Besides those at the bifrequencies (f1, f2), the cardiac self-coupling\nNonlinear cardio-respiratory interactions 5\nTable 1.\nData for six subjects measured during spontaneous and paced respiration.\nVT is average tidal volume, \u03c3VT\nis its standard deviation, f1 is average heart\nfrequency and f2 is average respiratory frequency during spontaneous f2s and\npaced f2p respiration. The tidal volume is obtained as a value between minimum\nvoltage recorded during expiration and a succeeding maximum voltage recorded\nduring inspiration. The voltages were not calibrated to express volumes in litres;\nrather, values were normalized to the average tidal volume obtained for each\nsubject during spontaneous respiration.

The\nfrequency resolution was set at 1\/10 of the lowest respiration frequency or better.\nThe slowest-paced breathing, f2, was around 0.1 Hz, so that a window of 100 s or\nlonger was necessary for estimation of the bispectrum, biphase and biamplitude. Short\nplateaus in the estimated biphase occur frequently. To exclude coincidence interactions\nwe focused on those that lasted for at least 10 periods of the lower coupling frequency\nf2. The length of the window also determines the time resolution. In the case of\nthe slowest-paced breathing, we were seeking \u223c 10 \u00d7 (1\/f2) = 100 s long epochs of\nconstant biphase. Therefore a window length of 100 s or less was necessary to meet\nthe criterion for time resolution. Due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (Kaiser\n1994), the scope for choice of window length is limited, and compromise is needed\nbetween time and frequency resolution. The window was moved along the time series\nwith a minimum time step of 1\/fs = 0.1 s, where fs is the sampling frequency. The\ncritical value for the biamplitude estimate to be considered valid was set in all cases\nto 2, i.e. twice the average value of the bispectrum within its so-called inner triangle\n(IT), as discussed in Appendix A.\nTo be able to conclude that quadratic coupling exists, we require several condition\nto be fulfilled: (i) a constant biphase during at least 10 periods of the lower-frequency\ninteracting component; (ii) biphases for all six (8) peaks must be present at the same\ntime as the biphase plateau; (iii) no phase slips must occur during the coupling, and\nthe biphase variations must stay within a pi rad interval (the biphase being expected\nto be more or less constant, depending on the coupling strength and noise intensity:\nphase slips are frequent when the interaction is extremely weak; they are mostly due\nto noise, but sometimes caused by modulation; strong modulation is expected to result\nin a biphase with fewer phase slips); (iv) The biamplitude must be above the chosen\ncritical value, i.e. be more than twice the average bispectrum value within the IT.\n3.

Their calculated frequency content is presented in the\nright hand column. The peak at \u223c0.98Hz belongs to cardiac activity, f1; that at\n\u223c0.11Hz to respiratory activity, f2, which was also obtained directly as a check by\nuse of a piezo sensor. Although the characteristic frequencies differ from person to\nperson, they all lie within defined frequency bounds. Stefanovska and Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 (1999)\nproposed that the respiration frequency interval should be defined as 0.14\u20130.6Hz with\na median frequency 0.3Hz. The spontaneous respiratory frequency for person 2 was\n0.14Hz, i.e. it fell at the lower limit of this interval. The slowest paced respiration\nfrequency was set to 0.09Hz.\nAssuming nonlinear cardio-respiratory coupling the cardiac side peaks are\npositioned at their sum f1 +f2 '1.09Hz, and difference f1\u2212f2 '0.87Hz. Cardiac 2f1\nand respiratory 2f2 second harmonics are also present. It can be seen that their precise\nvalues vary in time, which is what makes the analysis difficult. The widths of the peaks\nindicate their time-variable frequency content, which makes a time-frequency domain\npresentation more convenient (Kaiser 1994, Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 et al. 2000). The effect is, of course,\nassociated with the interactions between the cardiovascular oscillators.\nA typical bispectrum for the whole frequency domain for signal ba is presented\nin Fig. 2. A very high peak located at bifrequency (0.11Hz, 0.11Hz), belonging\nto the respiratory self-coupling can be seen. At least four other peaks are clearly\nevident: at (0.98Hz, 0.11Hz) attributable to cardio-respiratory coupling; at (0.87Hz,\n0.11Hz) which we assume to be coupling between the respiratory component f2 and\nthe difference f1 \u2212 f2, that could be due to a nonlinear coupling mechanism; and two\npeaks attributable to interaction with lower cardiovascular characteristic components.\nThe latter interactions (with the intrinsic myogenic and neurogenic oscillators) are\nnot of interest in the present context. Also, other lower frequency peaks can be seen\nin the bispectrum. Their positions can be seen in the bispectrum contour view shown\nin Fig. 2(b).\nThe bispectrum is sensitive to time-variations of the frequency components,\nyielding in the bispectrum a characteristic diagonal elongation of peaks. The cardiac\nfrequency f1 spans 0.93\u20131.02Hz. Although the respiratory frequency f2 extends from\n0.09Hz to 0.12Hz, this large range is actually the result of a single deep breath:\nNonlinear cardio-respiratory interactions 8\n76.8 172.4 471\n0\n380\nTime (s)\nA\nba\n1\n(ar\nb. \nun\nits\n)\n76.8 172.4 471\n0\n11\n\u03c6 b\na1\n \n(ra\nd)\nTime (s)\n(a)\n76.8 172.4 471\n0\n1300\nTime (s)\nA\nba\n2\n(ar\nb. \nun\nits\n)\n76.8 172.4 471\n0\n15\n\u03c6 b\na2\n \n(ra\nd)\nTime (s)\n(b)\nFigure 3.

The left column shows the bispectrum\n|Bba | with its corresponding contour plots; middle, the biamplitude Aba ;\nand right, the biphase \u03c6ba .\nthe respiratory frequency (being paced) is constant for most of the time, leading to\na high bispectrum. The cardio-respiratory bifrequency coupling consequently has a\nwide frequency range resulting mainly from variation of the cardiac frequency (in Fig.\n2 it is elongated along the f1 axes). The peaks corresponding to cardiac activity are\nlower, mainly due to time frequency variations. In the presence of quadratic nonlinear\ncoupling, peaks should be present at all six of the bifrequencies summarized in Table 2.\nSignificant values of the bispectrum (i.e. exceeding twice the average bispectrum within\nthe IT) were obtained near all these bifrequencies (see the left-hand column of Fig.3,\nshowing that the peaks are indeed present.\nOnce the peaks at the defined bifrequencies had been confirmed, the time biphase\nand biamplitude were calculated at the bifrequency peaks. It can be seen that the\nbiamplitude during the time interval from 76.8 s to 172.4 s meets our criterion of being\nmore than twice as large as the average bispectrum in the IT: see middle column of\nFig. 3. The biphase in this time interval, 95.6 s long (shaded area), remains constant\nwithin a 1.47 rad interval, i.e. there are no phase slips. The biphases at bifrequencies\n1, 2, 3 and 5 are very constant; those at 4 and 6 are less so, but they still remain\nwithin the pi rad interval.\n3.1. Global couplings\nBlood flow signals reflect local characteristics, but those derived from widely separated\nsites can be remarkably similar. Although they reflect the flow in the capillary\nbed, each of them contains the same information on the spatially invariant periodic\nactivities seen in the centrally generated cardiac and respiratory signals. The power\nof each oscillatory component in the peripheral blood flow varies with the vessels\u2019\ndiameters and the network density, i.e. the local resistance to the flow. The choice of\nmeasurement sites to have similar network density was based on human anatomy, viz.\nNonlinear cardio-respiratory interactions 9\non both wrist and ankle joints (Stefanovska and Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 1999, Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 et al. 2000).\nOur measured signals, i.e. channels a to d, come from widely differing sites.\nNonetheless, in agreement with the earlier work, the respiratory and cardiac\ncharacteristic frequency components preserve the same values and, moreover, their\nphase relationships contain the same information. The left-hand column of Fig. 4\nshows the bispectrum for peak 1 for signal bd measured on channel d. The maximum\namplitude of the peak is positioned at the same bifrequency (0.98Hz, 0.11Hz) as\nalready seen for peak 1 of signal the ba measured on channel a. The correlation of\nthe biamplitude and biphase for signals ba and bd is very high, both being 0.85, as\ncan also be seen from their time evolution presented in the right-hand and middle\ncolumn of Fig. 4. The biamplitude meets our amplitude criterion within the same\ntime interval from 76.8 s to 172.4 s during which the biphase is also constant. We\nobtain the same coupling information at all 4 measuring sites for all the peaks (1-\n8). The results obtained from time-bispectral analyses of the measured signals are\nsummarized in Table 3. Inspecting the data in Tables 1 and 3 we see no obvious\ncorrelation between the average tidal volume and the occurrence of nonlinear cardio-\nrespiratory interaction.\n3.2. Cross-bispectrum\nThe bispectrum as defined in (Jams\u02c7ek et al. 2003) can be seen as a special case of the\ncross-bispectrum when the three signals are the same. In addition to the blood flow\nsignals, the ECG e(t), respiration r(t) and blood pressure p(t) were also simultaneously\nrecorded. This gave us the possibility of globally checking the coupling between cardiac\nand respiratory activity, using bivariate data. Let us define the cross-bispectrum as\nBxyy(k, l) = X(k)Y (l)Y\n\u2217(k + l) (1)\nwhere X and Y are discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) of two different signals x(t)\nand y(t) at discrete frequencies k, l and k + l. We calculated the cross-bispectrum\nBcebb (where c stands for cross, e for signal e(t) and b for signal b(t)), for the case\nwhere x(t) is the ECG signal e(t) and y(t) is the blood flow signal ba(t). The ECG\nsignal tells us primarily about the cardiac electrical activity. The phase of the first,\ncardiac component f1, in the triplet (f1, f2, f1+f2) is thus directly extracted from the\nECG signal. The respiratory component f2 and the component at the harmonically\nrelated position f1 + f2 are extracted from the blood flow signal.\n76.8 172.4 471\n0\n240\nTime (s)\nA\nbd\n1\n(ar\nb. \nun\nits\n)\n76.8 172.4 471\n0\n10\n\u03c6 b\nd1\n(ra\nd)\nTime (s)\nFigure 4.

Quadratic nonlinear couplings detected in blood flow signals marked\nby \u2217 in Table 1. For each measurement, four blood flow signals were measured\nsimultaneously at different sites, channels a-d. Tqc is the time interval during\nwhich the bispectral analysis showed that the heart oscillator f1 and the\nrespiratory oscillator f2 might be nonlinear coupled. The product of Tqc \u00d7 f2\ntells us over how many respiratory periods the interaction persisted. During Tqc\nthe maximum biamplitude is calculated for the peak 1 that is of our primary\ninterest. In addition, the maximum variation of the biphase \u2206\u03c6, its average value\n\u03c6, and its standard deviation \u03c3\u03c6 were calculated during Tqc.\nPerson Breathing Chan. f1 f2 Tqc Tqc A1max \u2206\u03c6 \u03c6 \u03c3\u03c6\n(Hz) (Hz) (s) \u00d7f2 (A.U.)

The signal r(t) describes most directly the\nactivity of the respiratory oscillator. Therefore the phase of the second component in\nthe triplet (f1, f2, f1 +f2) is directly extracted from the respiratory signal. (ii) Bcprp,\nwhere x(t) is the blood pressure signal p(t) and y(t) is the respiration signal r(t).\nBy calculating the latter cross-bispectrum we are interested in establishing whether\nthe information about coupling between the heart and the respiratory oscillators is\nsignal-independent.\nWe proceeded as discussed above in section 2.2 for each of the three different cross-\nbispectrum cases. The time evolution of the signals e(t), r(t) and p(t) and their power\nspectra are presented in Fig. 5 (a) and (b). For the cross-bispectrum Bcebb all the peaks\nfrom 1 to 8 are present at the same bifrequencies as in the case of auto-bispectrum of\nthe blood flow signal. Since the power spectrum of the respiratory signal Pr exhibits\nonly components of the respiratory oscillator we cannot expect peaks 5, 6 and 8 to\nappear in the cross-bispectra Bcbrb and Bcprp. All the other peaks are present at the\nsame bifrequencies as in the auto-bispectrum. The biamplitude meets our amplitude\ncriterion within the same time interval from 76.8 s to 172.4 s, for all peaks; moreover\nthe biphase is constant during this time interval. Examples of the biamplitude and\nbiphase time evolution for peak 1 for the three different cross-bispectra are presented\nin Fig. 5 (c) and (d).\nCross-bispectra were also calculated with surrogate data, where the phases of the\nfrequency components of the signals e(t), r(t) and p(t) were randomized. No phase\ncouplings were detected in this case. The coupling information among cardiac and\nrespiratory process seems to be signal independent.\nNonlinear cardio-respiratory interactions 11\n0.11  0.98 1.96 \n0\n0.2\nf (Hz)\n0 25\n\u22120.3\n2.7\nTime (s)\ne(t\n)\n(V\n)\nf1 f2 2f2 \nf1\u2212f2 f1+f2 2f1P e\n(ar\nb. \nun\nits\n)\n0.11  0.98 1.96 \n0\n0.2\nf (Hz)\n0 25\n\u22120.22\n0.18 \nTime (s)\nr(t\n)\n(V\n)\nf1 f2 2f2 \nf1\u2212f2 f1+f2 2f1\nP r\n(ar\nb. \nun\nits\n)\n0.11  0.98 1.96 \n0\n0.08\nf (Hz)\n0 25\n\u22120.28\n0.97\nTime (s)\np(t\n)\n(V\n)\nf1 f2 2f2 \nf1\u2212f2 f1+f2 \n2f1\nP p\n(ar\nb. \nun\nits\n)\n(a)\n(b)\n76.8 172.4 471\n0\n700\nTime (s)\nA\nce\nbb\n1\n(ar\nb. \nun\nits\n)\n76.8 172.4 471\n0\n9\n\u03c6 ce\nbb\n1\n(ra\nd)\nTime (s) 76.8 172.4 471\n\u221220\n5\n\u03c6 cb\nrb\n1\n(ra\nd)\n76.8 172.4 471\n0  \n940\nTime (s)\nA\ncb\nrb\n1\n(ar\nb. \nun\nits\n)\nTime (s) 76.8 172.4 471\n0\n26\n\u03c6 cp\nrp\n1\n(ra\nd)\n76.8 172.4 471\n0\n750\nTime (s)\nA\ncp\nrp\n1 \n \n \n(ar\nb. \nun\nits\n)\nTime (s)\n(c)\n(d)\nFigure 5.

Discussion\nThe signals were measured from six persons, whereas in the first column of table 3 data\nare only provided for five; the sixth person also showed evidence of nonlinear couplings,\nbut over time intervals that were too short to fulfil our required conditions. Four blood\nflow signals simultaneously measured in different places (channels a, b, c, and d) were\navailable for each recording. We usually analyzed first the one with the most distinctive\ncharacteristic frequencies in its power spectrum and, if our criteria were fulfilled, we\nchecked the other three signals as well. The time interval Tqc during which quadratic\ncoupling persisted was determined; if all 6 peaks fulfilled our conditions, then the Tqc\ninterval was calculated for all peaks and the boundaries were defined such that the\nbiamplitude for all the peaks in Tqc interval would be above the condition.\nAlso shown in Table 3 are three cases where the couplings Tqc lasted less than\n10\u00d7 1\/f2, where 1\/f2 is the longest respiratory period, since they could be detected\nvery distinctly and clearly. Column A1max is the maximum biamplitude for peak 1\nduring the Tqc interval. The strength of the coupling is in general not correlated\nwith its duration. For each Tqc interval, the maximum variation \u2206\u03c6 of the biphase,\nits average value, and its standard deviation, were calculated. There was a single\ncase (only) of spontaneous breathing for which the coupling lasted long enough (82 s\nwithout phase slips) to fulfil our criteria; during spontaneous respiration phase slips\nare relatively frequent and epochs of constant biphase are short.\nNonlinear cardio-respiratory interactions 12\n4.1. Definition of the phase\nAs mentioned above in section 1, the cardiac and respiratory systems can be perceived\nas coupled autonomous oscillators. Using a bispectrum based on the Fourier transform,\nwhich is a decomposition of the signal in terms of complex exponential (sinusoidal)\ncomponents, each component can be represented as a point in a complex space,\n<[X(k)] versus =[X(k)], thus defining a vector, where X is DFT and k is a discrete\nfrequency. Its magnitude represents a power, whereas the phase is determined by the\nangle between the vector and the positive real axis. The phase of an oscillator is\ndefined as the phase of the sinusoidal component that lies closest to its characteristic\nfrequency. Thus our phase definition differs from that used in Kuramoto phase\nreduction (Kuramoto 1984). In this way it is possible to study the phase relations\nand to resolve the nature of the couplings.\n4.2. Nonlinear coupling, or linear coupling of strongly nonlinear oscillators?\nOur study is based on the assumptions that the cardiac and respiration processes can\nbe described as weakly nonlinear oscillators and that the interaction between them is\nalso weak (Stefanovska et al. 2001b). It is pertinent to investigate what happens when\nthese assumptions are not fulfilled. We have addressed the question in two different\nways based on analytic approximation and digital simulation, respectively.\nThe analysis in Appendix B considers harmonic generation by a pair of coupled,\nweakly nonlinear, oscillators. It confirms that, for weak coupling, the appearance of\nadditional harmonics at 2w2, 2w1, 2w1 \u00b1 2w2, w1 \u00b1 w2, 3w1 \u00b1 w2 can confidently\nbe associated with the presence of quadratic coupling. For a sufficiently nonlinear\noscillator and sufficiently strong coupling, these and other combinatorial harmonics\ncan in principle be generated, as a second order effect, even for linear coupling. As\nwill be illustrated below, however, the appearance of these combinatorial harmonics\ndoes not in itself fulfil the necessary conditions to support a conclusion that there\nis nonlinear coupling when tested by bispectral analysis: the high biamplitude and\nconstant biphase may be absent. In any case, the bispectral approach cannot be\nexpected to yield reliable information about the nature of the coupling when the\nnonlinearities are extremely strong.\nWe have therefore complemented the analysis of Appendix B with a digital\nsimulation, exploring the range of extreme conditions where the bispectral approach\nis expected to fail. We have chosen to simulate a generic model (3) of the van der\nPol relaxation oscillator, with an additional nonlinear term, linearly driven by another\nrelaxation van der Pol oscillator via an additive coupling\nx\u02d91 = y1\ny\u02d91 = \u03b51(1\u2212 x1)\n2y1 \u2212 \u03c9\n2\n1\nx1 + \u03b71x\n2\n1\n+ \u00b51(x1 \u2212 x2) + \u03be(t)\nx\u02d92 = y2\ny\u02d92 = \u03b52(1\u2212 x2)\n2y2 \u2212 \u03c9\n2\n2\nx2. (3)\nThe activity of the oscillators is described by the two state variables xi and yi, and\n\u03b5i and \u03c9i = 2pifi are constants, where i = 1, 2 denote respectively the driven or the\ndriving oscillator. \u03b71 is a constant that sets the strength of the additional nonlinear\nterm in the driven oscillator, and \u00b51 is the strength of the coupling. Here \u03be(t) is zero-\nmean white Gaussian noise, \u3008\u03be(t)\u3009 = 0, \u3008\u03be(t), \u03be(0)\u3009 = D\u03b4(t) and D = 0.8 is the noise\nNonlinear cardio-respiratory interactions 13\nintensity. Following the pioneering work of van der Pol and van der Mark (1928), the\nparameters are set to \u03b51 = 70, and \u03b52 = 3.\nA detailed parameter space analysis has been completed, showing that a situation\nindeed exists for which the bispectral technique fails to distinguish between the two\nsituations when: (i) two oscillators are strongly nonlinear, but linearly coupled; or\n(ii) when they are nonlinear and nonlinearly coupled. As an illustration, bispectral\nanalysis was performed for two coupled van der Pol oscillators, with and without added\nGaussian noise, for different sets of parameters. In the first case the strength of the\nadditional nonlinearity was changed, while \u00b51 was kept constant: (a) \u00b51 = const = 1;\n\u03b71 was 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 12 and 15, and from 20 to 90 was varied with step 10 and\n93 was also included. (b) \u00b51 = const = 25; \u03b71 was varied from 1 to 10 with step 1,\nvalues 12, 15, 18 and 25 were also considered, and again values from 20 to 60 with\nstep 10. In the second case the strength of the coupling was changed while \u03b71 was\nkept constant: (a) \u03b71 = const = 1; \u00b51 was varied from 0.1 to 1 with step 0.1, from\n1 to 10 with step 1, then values 2.5, 3.5, 11, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 120 and 200 were\nconsidered, and again values from 40 to 100 with step 10. (b) \u03b71 = const = 5; \u00b51 =\n25. (c) \u03b71 = const = 15: \u00b51 was varied from 1 to 10 with step 1, values 12, 15, 17, 20,\n24 and 25 were considered, and again from 30 to 60 with step 10.\nThe test signal xa(t) is the variable x1 of the driven oscillator, recorded as a\ncontinuous time series. For the first 400 s, the strength of the additional nonlinear\nterm, i.e. \u03b71 = 15 was very strong and the coupling, i.e. \u00b51 = 1 was relatively strong; \u00b51\nwas then substantially increased to 25, whereas the strength of the additional nonlinear\nterm was decreased to 1. After a further 400 s, the strength of the additional nonlinear\nterm was increased back to 15. The first 5 s and corresponding power spectrum for\neach coupling strength are shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). The peak 1.1Hz in the absence\nof coupling, labelled as f1, represents the driven cardiac oscillator; and f2 = 0.24Hz\nrepresents the driving respiratory oscillator. These frequencies are deliberately chosen\nsuch that their ratio is not an integer.\nThe power spectra for all the three different cases of the strengths of the linear\ncoupling and additional nonlinear term exhibit rich frequency content. As the coupling\ngets stronger, and\/or the strength of the additional nonlinear term increases, the\nfrequency content of the signal xa becomes richer. The power spectra clearly exhibit\ncomponents at the harmonically related positions f1 + f2 and f1 \u2212 f2.\nThe principal domain of the bispectrum for the test signal xa, Fig. 6 (c) and\n(d), shows a peak at the bifrequency (0.96Hz, 0.24Hz) that is of our primary interest.\nA window length of 100 s was chosen to calculate the instantaneous biphase and\nbiamplitude, Fig. 6 (e) and (f), and was moved across the signal in 0.1 s steps. The\nwhole signal is analyzed as a single entity, but transients caused by the changes in\ncoupling and\/or in the strength of the additional nonlinear term are removed prior to\nprocessing.\nDuring the period of relatively weak coupling \u00b51 = 1 and strong nonlinearities,\nno peak is present in the bispectrum as can be seen from the biamplitude, Fig. 6 (f),\nwhich remains far below unity (0.012). Moreover, at value \u03b71 = 0.7 the frequency\ncomponent at modulation position f1 + f2 appears in the power spectrum for the\nfirst time. The modulation components f1 \u00b1 f2 become large and almost equal in\nsize in the power spectrum, but not until \u03b71 = 15. However, even then, not all the\nnecessary peaks (also peak at bifrequency (f1, 2f2)) in the bispectrum are present\nand the method correctly resolves the absence of nonlinear coupling, even though the\nbiphase is constant, Fig. 6 (e).\nNonlinear cardio-respiratory interactions 14\n0 5 0 5 0 5\n\u22122\n2 (a)\nx\na(t\n)\n(ar\nb. \nun\nits\n)\nTime (s)\n0  2.5 0 2.5 0 2.5\n(b)\nP a\n(ar\nb. \nun\nits\n)\nf (Hz)\nf1\u2212f2 \nf1+f2 f1 f2 \nf1 \nf2 \nf1 \nf2 \nf1+f2 \nf1\u2212f2 \nf1+f2 \nf1\u2212f2 \n(1) (2) (3)\n50 1150\n\u22125\n40\n\u03c6 1 (ra\nd)\n50 1150\n\u22122\n3\n5\nTime (s)\nlo\ng 1\n0[A\n1(a\nrb.\n un\nits\n)]\n(f)\n(e)\nFigure 6.

Note that only for (3) are both conditions (i.e.\nhigh enough biamplitude, and constant biphase) for the (incorrect) inference of\nnonlinear coupling satisfied.\nBy grossly exaggerating the strength of the coupling, with \u00b51 = 25, the frequency\ncomponents that might also arise from nonlinear coupling become large. This results\nin substantial increases of the biamplitude at bifrequency (f1, f2) in the bispectrum;\nthe biphase is then non-constant, however, and increases continuously. Again the\nrequired conditions for the identification of nonlinear coupling are not fulfilled.\nIn the most extreme example shown, with very strong coupling and very strong\nadditional nonlinearity, i.e. with \u03b71 = 25, \u00b51 = 25, we are unable to distinguish\nbetween strong nonlinearity of the oscillators and strong nonlinear coupling. In a signal\ncoming from a \u201cblack box\u201d, the observed frequency components could mistakenly be\nattributed to nonlinear coupling: the bispectrum, Fig. 6 (c), contains all the necessary\nNonlinear cardio-respiratory interactions 15\npeaks (only three of them are visible, the rest of them being much smaller, although\nfulfilling the necessary amplitude condition). There are other frequency components\nthat could result from nonlinear coupling, and the biphase remains constant. In this\ncase the method clearly fails.\nThere are, however, compelling arguments suggesting that the cardiac and\nrespiratory subsystems should be in fact treated as weakly nonlinear oscillators that\nare weakly coupled. (i) in healthy subjects, breathing spontaneously, only occasional\nand brief episodes of synchronization are seen (Scha\u00a8fer et al. 1998, 1999, Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 Lotric\u02c7\nand Stefanovska 2000), indicative of relatively weak coupling. (ii) Sinus arrhythmia\nis small at spontaneous breathing frequencies and only slightly larger at very low\nbreathing frequencies (Eckberg 2003), again supporting a weak-coupling description.\n(iii) The couplings can sometimes decrease almost to vanishing point, e.g. in coma\n(Stefanovska and Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 1999). Without couplings, the dynamics becomes drastically\nsimplified \u2013 with complete absence of synchronization or modulation. The fact that\nvirtually no variability is seen in any of the natural frequencies, despite small amplitude\nvariations attributable to internal noise, suggests that the oscillators themselves are\nat most weakly nonlinear. (iv) If there were strong oscillator nonlinearity, and strong\n(but linear) coupling, we would observe many combinatorial components around the\ncardiac frequency, which is not the case (see Fig. 1(a)-(d)). The excessively strong-\ncoupling regime explored in the above simulations would appear, therefore, to be\nlargely irrelevant to the cardio-respiratory interaction that we study in this paper: our\nbispectral technique (Jams\u02c7ek et al. 2003) should be applicable as we have assumed.\n4.3. Unidirectional or bidirectional coupling\nWe have studied the combinatorial frequencies that arise from the influence of the\nrespiratory on the cardiac system. This naturally begs the question of whether the\ncoupling is unidirectional or bidirectional. Using the same method one could equally\nwell analyse the combinatorial frequencies responsible for the influence of cardiac on\nthe respiratory system. In fact, using newly developed algorithms for analysis of\nthe direction of coupling (Schreiber 2000, Rosenblum and Pikovsky 2001, Rosenblum\net al. 2002, Palus\u02c7 et al. 2001), it has already been shown (Stefanovska 2002, Palus\u02c7\nand Stefanovska 2003) that the two systems are bidirectionally coupled. The effect of\nrespiratory system is, however, dominant (i.e. is the driving system) at all respiratory\nfrequencies, whether paced or spontaneous.\nAlthough during paced respiration the respiration frequency is kept constant, the\nsituation differs markedly from that of a forced oscillator (with the cardiac oscillator\nbeing driven, and the respiration oscillator being the driver). Paced respiration\nexperiments can in fact be perceived as a state of the system of two coupled oscillators\nwhere, although the frequency of one of them (respiration) is forced and kept constant,\nthe interaction between the two oscillators remains spontaneous.\n5. Summary and conclusions\nThe blood flow signal contains a great deal of information and is exceptionally\nchallenging in relation to processing. It possesses components whose amplitudes\nand frequencies vary in time. Moreover, the interactions among its characteristic\noscillations also vary in time, and their nature (frequency, phase, linear and\/or\nNonlinear cardio-respiratory interactions 16\nquadratic couplings) also changes giving rise to the observed complexity of\ncardiovascular dynamics.\nBispectral analysis has provided insight into the nature of the couplings. Our\nresults support the inference that the dynamics of blood flow can usefully be considered\nin terms of coupled oscillators. Application to the cardio-respiratory interaction has\nshown for the first time that nonlinear coupling is present. We have not sought\nevidence for couplings beyond second order, but higher order coupling may also exist.\nWe have shown that the effect of the coupling between the cardiac and respiratory\noscillations is episodic, rather than fixed and permanent. Moreover, an interchange\nbetween frequency and phase couplings is also present, as demonstrated by the\nevolution of their time-biphase.\nNonlinear coupling was revealed, and shown to exist during spontaneous as\nwell as during paced respiration. Episodes with nonlinear coupling were detected\nin 11 out of the 22 recordings and lasted between 19 s in case of high respiratory\nfrequency (f2p = 0.34 Hz) to 106 s in case of low paced frequency of respiration\n(f2P = 0.11 Hz). The episodic nature of the cardio-respiratory interaction in a healthy\nhuman during spontaneous and paced respiration had already been demonstrated\nusing quite different techniques of analysis (Kenner et al. 1976, Raschke 1987, Seidel\nand Herzel 1998, Scha\u00a8fer et al. 1999, Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 Lotric\u02c7 and Stefanovska 2000, Rzeczinski\net al. 2002). It allows us to infer that the inter-oscillator coupling is probably relatively\nweak.\nUsing bispectral and cross-bispectral analysis we have also shown that the\ncoupling information among cardiac and respiratory processes is temporally and\nspatially invariant. Both processes are of central origin and their phase relationships\ncan be observed in ECG, blood flow and blood pressure signals derived from widely\nseparated sites. It would appear that the information is incorporated within the wave\nmotion of the blood propagating through the vessels.\nIt is of interest to compare our experiment with that of Davies et al. (2000).\nThey too studied physiological time series while respiration was being paced at a\nconstant rate; in addition, they also guided the ventilatory amplitude (tidal volume)\nso as to produce a sinsusoidal modulation envelope of period 60 s. It resulted in\noscillations of the same period in several physiological quantities, including the R\u2013R\nintervals, blood pressure, and the cardiac stroke volume and output. In the present\nstudy, the ventilatory amplitude was left to the subject\u2019s spontaneous choice. The\nslow amplitude modulation of Davies et al. (2000) was selected to mimic the pattern\nof Cheyne-Stokes respiration often associated with heart failure. In our study, without\nany amplitude modulation, we were examining the question whether the relationship\nbetween cardiac and respiratory oscillations can be nonlinear. It is difficult to decide\nwhether the nonlinear interactions, shown to occur episodically in the present study,\nwould or would not have occurred if the amplitude of respiratory oscillations had also\nbeen controlled, as in the study by Davies et al. (2000). We have shown, however,\nthat quadratic coupling exists even when both the frequency and the amplitude of\nrespiration are spontaneous. We may therefore conclude that the nonlinear nature of\nthe interaction between the cardiac and respiratory oscillations is inherent, and that\nit becomes more pronounced when the frequency of respiration is kept constant.\nThe questions of what the nonlinear couplings mean, and how they arise, are yet\nto be resolved. A full understanding of these couplings is essential to gain insight\ninto the physiology and pathophysiology of cardiovascular dynamics, as well as for the\nconstruction of mathematical models offering novel possibilities for obtaining clinically\nNonlinear cardio-respiratory interactions 17\nrelevant physiological information. We conclude that bispectral analysis provides a\npromising tool for the determination of frequency and phase couplings in the processing\nand understanding of cardiovascular signals.\nAcknowledgements\nWe gratefully acknowledge valuable discussions and correspondence with Yoshiki\nKuramoto, Bojan Musizza and Yuri Shiogai.

For real signals, the bispectrum has 12 symmetry regions. Because of these, it\nis necessary to calculate the bispectrum only in the non-redundant region, or principal\ndomain. The latter can be divided into two triangular regions in which the discrete\nbispectrum has different properties: the inner triangle (IT), and the outer one (Hinich\n1990, Sharfer and Messer 1993, Hinich and Messer 1995). In the current work it is the\nIT that is of primary interest. Thus it is sufficient to calculate the bispectrum over\nthe IT of the principal domain defined in (Nikias and Petropulu 1993): 0 \u2264 l \u2264 k,\nk + l \u2264 fs\/2.\nTo be able to compare results a normalization procedure was performed. For each\nbispectrum and biphase estimate, a bispectrum was first calculated for the whole IT\nusing the same parameters, i.e. number of segments, segment length, percentage of\nsegment overlap, type of tapering window, and size of window for frequency averaging.\nThe normalization value was calculated as the average bispectrum estimate over the\nIT (Jams\u02c7ek et al. 2003).\nNormalization is parameter dependent. The more segments (short windows) for\nthe bispectrum calculation, the higher its average value over the IT becomes. It\nhas local maxima, because the width of the window directly affects the frequency\nresolution. The better the frequency resolution, the smaller the leakage effect. Higher\npercentages of overlap result in a lower average value over the IT, whereas the\nfrequency averaging window increases the average value.\nThe normalized bispectrum also indicates the average level of quadratic nonlinear\nphase coupling and, in a way, serves as an indicator of how non-Gaussian the signal\nis (Hinich 1982).\nThe critical values for the bispectrum and biamplitude estimates were normalized\nto 1. If the estimated value is higher than the average value of bispectrum in the IT,\nthen it is taken as valid. By critical value is meant a value that exceeds the leakage\naffect, the noisy background (other than Gaussian), and rounding errors.\nAPPENDIX B: GENERATION OF HARMONICS\nIn this appendix we show which harmonics appear in the spectrum of a weakly driven\nweakly nonlinear oscillator, and in particular we establish which harmonics correspond\nNonlinear cardio-respiratory interactions 18\nto quadratic coupling. The analysis that follows is for a Poincare\u00b4 oscillator, but a\nsimilar result also follows for e.g. a van der Pol or other oscillators of similar type.\nConsider an oscillator of the form\nx\u02d91 = \u2212x1r1 \u2212 w1y1 + Q(x2, x1), (4)\ny\u02d91 = \u2212y1r1 + w1x1, (5)\nr1 = \u03b1(\n\u221a\nx2\n1\n+ y2\n1\n\u2212 a), (6)\nwhere the term Q(x2, x1) corresponds to a coupling of the main oscillator (x1, y1) to\nanother one (x2, y2).\nWe seek a solution in the form\nx1 = A sin(w1t + \u03c6), (7)\ny1 = \u2212A cos(w1t + \u03c6), (8)\nand transform equations (4)-(5) into amplitude\/phase coordinates\nA\u02d9 = \u2212\u03b1A(A\u2212 a) + Q(x2, A, \u03c6) sin(w1t + \u03c6), (9)\nA\u03c6\u02d9 = Q(x2, A, \u03c6) cos(w1t + \u03c6). (10)\nIf there is no coupling (Q(x2, A, \u03c6) = 0) this system has the simple solution\nA = A0 = a, \u03c6 = \u03c60 = const. (11)\nIf the coupling is non-zero, the system cannot be solved exactly analytically. An\napproximate solution for small coupling and weak nonlinearity can, however, still be\nobtained. The amplitude and phase in this case vary only slightly and they can be\nexpanded about (A0, \u03c60) as\nA = A0 + \u03b2, \u03c6 = \u03c60 + \u03b3. (12)\nFor small \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b1 the equations (9)-(10) corresponding to those for \u03b2\u02d9 and \u03b3\u02d9 can\nbe solved approximately. For the simplest linear coupling of form\nQ(x2, A, \u03c6) = Q(x2) = F sin(w2t) (13)\none obtains\n\u03b2 \u2248\nF\n2(w1 \u2212 w2)\nsin((w1 \u2212 w2)t + \u03c60)\n\u2212\nF\n2(w1 + w2)\nsin((w1 + w2)t + \u03c60),\n\u03b3 \u2248\nF\n2a(w1 \u2212 w2)\ncos((w1 \u2212 w2)t + \u03c60)\n\u2212\nF\n2a(w1 + w2)\ncos((w1 + w2)t + \u03c60).\nThen, in the spectrum of the variable\nx = (A0 + \u03b2) sin(w1t + \u03c60 + \u03b3) (14)\none observes the following harmonics: w1, w2, 2w1 \u00b1 w1. In the case of quadratic\ncoupling\nQ(x2, A, \u03c6) = F (x2 \u2212 x1)\n2 = F (A sin(w2t)\u2212 x1)\n2, (15)\nthere appear additional harmonics: 2w2, 2w1, 2w1 \u00b1 2w2, w1 \u00b1 w2, 3w1 \u00b1 w2. In the\nlimit under consideration, with small nonlinearity and weak coupling, the appearance\nREFERENCES 19\nof these additional combinational harmonics can confidently be associated with the\npresence of a nonlinear coupling.\nIt is of course the case that, for a nonlinear oscillator, all sorts of combinational\nharmonics can in principle appear even for linear coupling. However, the generation\nof these harmonics is a second order effect which becomes significant only for large\nnonlinearity and large coupling coefficients. Under the latter circumstances, just the\nappearance of particular combinational harmonics cannot necessarily be related to a\ngiven type of coupling and some further analysis is then required.\nReferences\nBrac\u02c7ic\u02c7 M, McClintock P V E and Stefanovska A 2000 Characteristic frequencies of the\nhuman blood distribution system in Broomhead D S, Luchinskaya E A, McClintock\nP V E and Mullin T, eds., Stochastic and Chaotic Dynamics in the Lakes (Melville,\nNew York: American Institute of Physics) pp. 146\u2013153\nBrac\u02c7ic\u02c7 M and Stefanovska A 1998 Wavelet based analysis of human blood flow\ndynamics Bull.
