Recent findings posit that sn-1-diacylglycerol lipases (DAGL\u0001\/\u0002)\nsynthesize 2-AG in themotile axon segment of developing pyramidal cells. Coincident axonal targeting of CB1Rs andDAGLs prompts the\nhypothesis that autocrine 2-AG signaling facilitates axonal outgrowth. However, DAGLs alone are insufficient to account for the spatial\nspecificity and dynamics of 2-AG signaling. Therefore, we hypothesized that local 2-AG degradation by monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL)\nmust play a role. We determined how subcellular recruitment of MGL is temporally and spatially restricted to establish the signaling\ncompetence of 2-AG during axonal growth. MGL is expressed in central and peripheral axons of the fetal nervous system by embryonic\nday 12.5. MGL coexists with DAGL\u0001 and CB1Rs in corticofugal axons of pyramidal cells. Here, MGL and DAGL\u0001 undergo differential\naxonal targeting with MGL being excluded from the motile neurite tip. Thus, spatially confined MGL activity generates a 2-AG-sensing\nmicrodomain and configures 2-AG signaling to promote axonal growth. Once synaptogenesis commences, MGL disperses in stationary\ngrowth cones. The axonal polarity of MGL is maintained by differential proteasomal degradation because inhibiting the ubiquitin\nproteasome system also induces axonal MGL redistribution. Because MGL inactivation drives a CB1R-dependent axonal growth re-\nsponse, we conclude that 2-AGmay act as a focal protrusive signal for developing neurons andwhose regulatedmetabolism is critical for\nattaining correct axonal complexity.\nIntroduction\nAcquisition of a characteristic neuronal cytoarchitecture and\nconnectivity pattern relies on signaling cassettes whose coordi-\nnated expression and temporal interplay drive neuronal identifi-\ncation in the developing nervous system (Iba\u00b4n\u02dcez and Ernfors,\n2007; Fishell and Hanashima, 2008). Endocannabinoid (eCB) sig-\nnaling affects neural state change decisions either directly (Berghuis\net al., 2007)orby interactingwithneurotrophin(Maisonetal., 2009)\nor cytokine signaling (Zorina et al., 2010). The discovery that neu-\nronal lineage commitment and axonal polarization coincide with\nCB1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) expression (Coutts et al., 2001;\nBegbie et al., 2004; Berghuis et al., 2007; Mulder et al., 2008) and\npersist in the presence of a particularly high 2-arachidonoyl glycerol\n(2-AG) tone (Berrenderoet al., 1999)prompted theview thatdown-\nstream signaling fromCB1Rs diversifies the cellular outcome of eCB\nsignaling indevelopingneurons (Bromberg et al., 2008). In contrast,\nthe developmental dynamics of 2-AG signaling entailing coordi-\nnated expression of the 2-AG synthesizing and degrading enzymes\nsn-1-diacylglycerol lipases \u0001\/\u0002 (DAGL\u0001\/\u0002) (Bisogno et al., 2003)\nandmonoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) (Dinhet al., 2002), respectively,\nremain essentially unexplored. Understanding spatial and temporal\nconstraints of the metabolic network responsible for regulating\n2-AG bioavailability is necessary to appreciate the physiological sig-\nnificance of 2-AG in the hierarchy of integrative signaling networks\nthat determine neuronal identity.\nReceived April 26, 2010; revised Aug. 6, 2010; accepted Aug. 13, 2010.\nThis work was supported by the Scottish Universities Life Science Alliance (T.H.), European Molecular Biology\nOrganization Young Investigator Programme (T.H.), SwedishMedical Research Council (T.H.), Alzheimer\u2019s Research\nTrust UK (T.H.), Alzheimer\u2019s Association (K.M., T.H.), European Commission Grant HEALTH-F2-2007-201159 (T.H.),\nGrant-in-Aid for Scientific Research fromtheMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, andTechnologyof Japan\n(Y.Y.), Takeda Science Foundation (Y.Y.), the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation (Y.M.M.), the Kavli Institute\nfor Neuroscience at Yale University (Y.M.M.), and National Institutes of Health Grants DA023214 (T.H.), DA11322\n(K.M.), and DA21696 (K.M.).

Alternatively, 2-AG released from corticofugal axons can\nact as a paracrine guidance signal and limit premature dispersion\nof axon collaterals by establishing permissive pathfinding corri-\ndors (Mulder et al., 2008). Accordingly, impaired CB1R function\nduring growth cone navigation presents an aberrant axon fascic-\nulation and postsynaptic target selection phenotype (Berghuis et\nal., 2007; Watson et al., 2008). However, the above model is in-\ncomplete because it neither identifies an axonal domain whose\ncytoskeletal dynamics are particularly sensitive to eCBs nor ex-\nplains how eCB actions are restricted to the distal motile axon\nsegment to drive its unidirectional extension. Therefore, an ade-\nquate mechanistic concept must imply focal 2-AG-degrading ac-\ntivity, likely produced by MGL, known to degrade 85\u201390% of\n2-AG in adult brain homogenates (Blankman et al., 2007), to\nrestrict 2-AG signaling to the navigating growth cone and away\nfrom the consolidating neurite shaft.\nHere, we explored the developmental dynamics of MGL ex-\npression and its spatial relationship with CB1R and DAGL\u0001\/\u0002\nduring forebrain development. We identify a metabolic regula-\ntory network allowing both autocrine and paracrine 2-AG signal-\ning to operate in developing brain with CB1R being dispensable\nto regulate the expression and correct axonal targeting of both\nMGL and DAGL\u0001. We directly implicate 2-AG signaling in axon\ndevelopment by demonstrating that site-directed MGL inactiva-\ntion triggers a CB1R-dependent axonal growth response.\nMaterials andMethods\nAnimals and tissue preparation.

Hoechst 35,528 (Sigma), a nuclear dye, has been ap-\nplied to reveal tissue architecture. Antibodies raised against CB1R, its\nC-terminal interacting protein 1a isoform (CRIP1a), DAGL\u0001, andMGL\n(Twitchell et al., 1997; Yoshida et al., 2006; Uchigashima et al., 2007;\nStraiker et al., 2009) were independently validated by at least two of the\nfollowing methods: (1) preadsorption of primary antibodies with their\ncorresponding fusion protein (5 \u0004g\/ml) in vitro and\/or in vivo, (2) colo-\ncalization with hemagglutinin-tagged target protein heterologously ex-\npressed in human embryonic kidneyHEK293 cells, (3) lack of staining in\ncorresponding null mice (data not shown for DAGL\u0001 or MGL), or (4)\nidentical staining patterns by multiple antibodies recognizing distinct\nepitopes within a target protein (supplemental Figs. 1\u20133, available at\nwww.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).\nSections were inspected, and images were acquired on a 710LSM con-\nfocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped to separate emis-\nsion signals through spectral detection and unmixing. Emission spectra\nfor each dye was limited as follows: Hoechst (420\u2013485 nm), carbocya-\nnine 2 (Cy2) (505\u2013530 nm), Cy3 (560\u2013610 nm), andCy5 (640\u2013720 nm).\nImage surveys were generated using the tile scan function with optical\nzoom ranging from 0.6\u0004 to 1.5\u0004 at 10\u0004 primary magnification (objec-\ntive, EC Plan-Neofluar 10\u0004\/0.30). Images were processed using the\nZEN2009 software (Carl Zeiss). Multipanel figures were assembled in\nCorelDraw X3 (Corel Corp.).\nColocalization was defined as immunosignals being present without\nphysical signal separation in \u00051.0 \u0004m optical slices at 40\u0004 (Plan-\nNeofluar 40\u0004\/1.30) or 63\u0004 (Plan-Apochromat 63\u0004\/1.40) primarymag-\nnification (Mulder et al., 2009). The colocalization utility of theZEN2009\nsoftware package was used to determine (1) the relative area occupancy\nfor each fluorochrome, defined as the density of fluorescence pixels nor-\nmalized to a 1 \u0004m2 surface area, (2) the colocalization coefficient of\nCB1R versus MGL immunoreactivities in the cortical plate or thalamus,\nexpressed as the relative number of colocalizing pixels in one channel\ncompared with the total number of pixels above threshold in another\nchannel, and (3) Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient defining the intensity\ndistribution within colocalizing regions (ranging from\u00011 to\u00021, with 0\nindicating no correlation).\nPreembedding electron microscopy. E13\u2013E13.5 mouse embryos were\ndecapitated, and brains were immersion fixed overnight (Morozov et al.,\n2009). Preembedding immunoperoxidase labeling to localize CB1Rs in\ncoronal vibratome sections (100 \u0004m) was performed with specimens\nsubsequently osmificated and contrasted (Morozov et al., 2009).\nIn utero electroporation. At E11.5, in utero electroporation was per-\nformed as described previously (Torii et al., 2009) by injecting a DNA\nsolution containing a pCAGGS\u2013EGFP plasmid at a concentration of 0.5\nmg\/ml using a pulled glass capillary. Electroporation was performed us-\ning a BTXECM830 square wave electroporator with five electric pulses at\n25 V for 50 ms each with 950 ms intervals (Morozov et al., 2009). Dams\nwere decapitated after 3\u20136 d, and embryos were removed and inspected\nfor EGFP fluorescence (Stemi SV11 Apo; Carl Zeiss). EGFP-expressing\nbrains were immersion fixed and sectioned, and CB1Rs were localized as\nabove.\nNeuronal cultures, immunocytochemistry, and morphometry. Embry-\nonic cortices and hippocampiwere dissected at E14.5 or E16.5. Cells were\ndissociated by trypsin (0.1%) and plated on coverslips coated with poly-\nD-lysine (PDL) (Sigma). Cultured neurons (30\u201350,000 cells per well in\n24-well plates) were maintained for 2 or 4 d in vitro (DIV) as described\npreviously (Mulder et al., 2008). Lactacystin (20 \u0004M; Tocris Bioscience),\nan irreversible inhibitor of the 20S proteasome, the DAGL inhibitors\ntetrahydrolipstatin (THL) (1\u0004M; Sigma) andO-3841 (1\u0004M) (Bisogno et\nal., 2006), the MGL inhibitors JZL184 (100 nM; Cayman Chemical)\n(Long et al., 2009) and URB 602 (5 \u0004M; Cayman Chemical) (King et al.,\n2007), and the neutral CB1R antagonist O-2050 (200 nM; Tocris Bio-\nscience) were added to modulate axonal MGL distribution and growth\nrates as well as to induce growth cone collapse. Immunocytochemistry\nwas performed with select combinations of primary antibodies (supple-\nmental Table 1, available atwww.jneurosci.org as supplementalmaterial)\n(Berghuis et al., 2007). TheDotti stagingmethodwas used to define axon\ndevelopment (Dotti et al., 1988). Images of cortical neurons and their\naxons were captured by means of laser-scanning microscopy (model\n710LSM; Carl Zeiss). Neurite length and the surface area of individual\ngrowth cones were determined at the time points indicated (see Fig. 9) by\nanalyzing calibrated images in the LSM5 image browser softwaremodule\n(version 3.2.0.115; Carl Zeiss).\nPCR. E16.5 embryonic brains (n \u0005 4) were microdissected on ice to\nisolate cortical and thalamic regions and snap frozen in liquid N2 until\nprocessing. Primary cultures from cortex and thalamus were established\nat E16.5 andmaintained for 4 DIV at a density of 1\u0004 106 cells per well in\nPDL-coated six-well plates (n\u0005 2 per region). RNA was extracted using\nthe RNeasymini kit (Qiagen) with aDNase I step performed to eliminate\ntraces of genomic DNA (supplemental Fig. 4A1,A2, available at www.\njneurosci.org as supplemental material) and reverse transcribed using a\nhigh-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems).\nKeimpema et al. \u2022Metabolic Control of 2-AG Signaling in Axons J. Neurosci., October 20, 2010 \u2022 30(42):13992\u201314007 \u2022 13993\nQuantitative PCRs were performed after an initial 10 min 95\u00b0C denatur-\nation followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s denaturation, annealing and\nextension at calculated temperatures (60 s), and a dissociation stage\n(from 60 to 95\u00b0C with 0.5\u00b0C steps for 10 s each) (MyiQ; Bio-Rad), with\nprimer pairs amplifying short fragments for each gene (supplemental Fig.\n4B, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Samples\nwithout template or reverse transcriptase served as negative control. Ex-\npression levels were obtained by subtracting the value for each sample in\nthe absence of reverse transcriptase from the corresponding value in the\npresence of reverse transcriptase and then normalizing to the housekeep-\ning gene encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase\n(GAPDH) obtained for every sample in parallel assays (Berghuis et al.,\n2005).\nWestern blotting. Tissue samples were lysed in modified radioimmu-\nnoprecipitation assay buffer containing 1 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 0.1%\nN-octyl-\u0002-D-glucopyranoside, and a mixture of protease inhibitors\n(Roche), denatured in 5\u0004 Laemmli\u2019s buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE\n(30 \u0004g of protein per sample) (Berghuis et al., 2005). Membranes were\nblocked in Odyssey blocking buffer (LiCor Biosciences) for 1 h and ex-\nposed to primary antibodies (supplemental Table 1, available at www.\njneurosci.org as supplemental material) overnight at 4\u00b0C. \u0002-III-Tubulin\n(1:2000; Promega) or\u0002-actin (1:10,000; Promega) served as loading con-\ntrol. Appropriate combinations of IRDye800 and IRDye680 antibodies\n(fromgoat or rabbit hosts; 1:10,000, 2 h; LiCor Biosciences)were used for\nsignal detection on a LiCor Odyssey IR imager. Integrated optical densi-\nties were determined using NIH ImageJ 1.32j. Experiments were per-\nformed in triplicate.\nLiquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. 2-AG concentra-\ntions were determined using a solid-phase extraction liquid chromatog-\nraphy tandemmass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS)method (Giuffrida et al.,\n2000). Tissues from n \u0005 4\u20138 embryos per developmental stage were\nhomogenized in ice-cold acetonitrile containing [ 2H4]anandamide\n(AEA) at 6 pmol as the internal standard, made up to 70% water and\ncentrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was applied to\nStrata-X polymeric reversed-phase cartridges (Phenomenex), methanol-\neluted analytes were dried under N2, and the residue was resuspended in\nmobile phase. A Surveyor LC system coupled to a TSQ Quantum mass\nspectrometer (Fisher Thermo Scientific) was used for analysis. The ana-\nlytes were eluted from an ACE 5\u0004 C8 column (150\u0004 2.1 mm; Hichrom\nLtd.) under isocratic conditions with a mobile phase consisting of 15%\nwater, 85%methanol, and 0.5% formic acid at a flow rate of 200 \u0004l\/min\nat 30\u00b0C. MS analysis was performed using electrospray ionization in\npositive ion mode. Quantification was undertaken using single-reaction\nmonitoring of the parent ion\u2013product ion transitions for 2-AG and\n[2H4]AEA of mass-to-charge ratio (m\/z) ofm\/z 379 tom\/z 287 andm\/z\n352.2 tom\/z 66.2, respectively. Two peaks were present in the chromato-\ngram for 2-AG because a 1(3)-isomer exists in equilibrium with 2-AG.\nThe areas of both peaks were combined to calculate [2-AG] by weighted\nlinear regression analysis against suitable calibration standards using\nXcalibur 2.0.6 software (Fisher Thermo Scientific). Results were ex-\npressed as nanomoles per gram of tissue.\nStatistics. A p value of \u00060.05 was considered statistically significant\n(Student\u2019s t test) (SPSS version 16.0). Data were expressed as means \u0007\nSEM. Fluorescence intensity distributions in individual axons were\ncalculated by NIH ImageJ 1.32j and plotted in GraFit 5.0 (Erithacus\nSoftware).\nResults\nDevelopmental dynamics of MGL expression\nCB1R and DAGL expression and function are tightly regulated to\nmodulate neuronal polarization and axonal growth in the devel-\noping nervous system (Bisogno et al., 2003; Leterrier et al., 2006;\nBerghuis et al., 2007; Vitalis et al., 2008; Maison et al., 2009;\nWalker et al., 2010). Both pyramidal cells and interneurons rely\non CB1Rs to transduce eCB signals (Berghuis et al., 2007; Mulder\net al., 2008). DAGL expression and cell-autonomous activity are\nretained only by pyramidal cells, whereas GABAergic interneu-\nrons depend on extracellular 2-AG cues (Walker et al., 2010). In\ncontrast, the spatiotemporal dynamics of MGL expression and\nfunction in the developing nervous system remain unknown.\nWe generated polyclonal antibodies raised against distinct\nMGL epitopes (supplemental Table 1, supplemental Fig. 3, avail-\nable at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) to deter-\nmine the distribution pattern of MGL in the developing nervous\nsystem of the mouse. We find MGL\u0002 progenitors residing in the\nventricular (VZ) and subventricular (SVZ) zones of the telence-\nphalic vesicles at E12.5 (Fig. 1A\u2013A2). MGL\n\u0002 pioneer axons are\ncommitted to the olfactory nerve (Fig. 1A1) and thalamic projec-\ntions (Fig. 1A2) at this developmental stage. However, GFP\n\u0002\nGABAergic neurons migrating toward the cerebral cortex lack\nappreciable MGL expression (Fig. 1A1,A2).\nWe used homozygous tau\u2013EGFP mice to resolve the subcel-\nlular distribution of MGL in the developing mouse brain (Fig.\n1B,B1) as well as peripheral ganglia and nerves at E14.5. tau\u2013\nEGFP mice were constructed by placing EGFP cDNA in-frame\nwith the endogenous initiation codon of the tau gene such that a\nfusion protein is produced comprising the first 31 aa of tau fol-\nlowed by EGFP (Tucker et al., 2001). The chimeric protein is\nparticularly advantageous in a developmental context because\nEGFP replaces the C-terminal microtubule-binding domains of\ntau, resulting in an entirely cytoplasmic EGFP signal in projection\nneurons, such as Brn-1\u0002 cortical pyramidal cells (Fig. 1D3)\n(Sugitani et al., 2002) but not in GABA\u0002 interneurons (data not\nshown).\nPeripheral ganglia, including trigeminal (Fig. 1C) and dorsal\nroot ganglia (data not shown), harbored many MGL\u0002 neurons.\nConsequently, MGL\u0002 axons concentrated in facial and mandib-\nular trunks of the trigeminal nerve, including those innervating\nthe whiskers, the spinal trigeminal tract (Fig. 1C1,C2), and the\nstalk of the optic nerve (Fig. 1C1). MGL\n\u0002 central structures in-\nclude the parabrachial\/microcellular tegmental nucleus and the\ncolliculi superior and inferior (Fig. 1C1,C3). In the forebrain, the\nolfactory nerve, VZ\/SVZ progenitors, postmitotic cortical neu-\nrons, and axons coursing along the palliosubpallial boundary,\npresumed thalamocortical axons (TCAs), were MGL\u0002 (Fig.\n1C,C1). By analyzing coronal sections of the fetalmouse brain, we\nconfirmed that both optic nerves and TCAs traversing the infe-\nrior thalamic radiation (Fig. 1D,D1) are MGL\n\u0002. MGL\u0002 TCAs\nadvance in the subplate as far as the medial pallial fold (Fig. 1D2)\nand coexist with radially migrating MGL\u0002 postmitotic neurons\nexiting the SVZ (but not RC2\u0002 radial glia) and MGL-negative\n(MGL\u0001)\/GFP\u0002 GABA cells migrating tangentially in the mar-\nginal zone of this cortical domain. In the lateroventral isocortex,\nMGL\u0002 ascending TCAs appear intermingled with radially mi-\ngrating Brn-1\u0002\/MGL\u0002 cortical pyramidal cells and can target\nthese cells once they reached the cortical plate (Fig. 1D4).\nMost long-range forebrain tracts (Fig. 1E), including the pe-\nripheral (Fig. 1E1) and central segments (Fig. 1E2) of the optic\nnerve, lateral olfactory tract, fimbria hippocampi, and TCAs, re-\ncruit MGL\u0002 axons by E16.5, which we recognize as the develop-\nmental stage after which axonal MGL targeting terminates. After\nthis time,MGL is restricted to the perisomatic segment and prox-\nimal dendrites both in the late-gestational brain (Fig. 1F) and at\nbirth (data not shown). We find that restricted MGL expression\ninversely correlates with cortical and hippocampal 2-AG concen-\ntrations (Fig. 1G): 10.2\u0007 1.1 (E14.5), 13.9\u0007 3.2 (E16.5), 13.21\u0007\n1.8 (E18.5) ng\/mg tissue versus 21.2 \u0007 4.2 postnatal day 0 (P0),\n35.78\u0007 7.8 (P1; p\u0006 0.05 vs all fetal groups examined), 44.4\u0007 9.8\nng\/mg tissue (P2; p\u0006 0.05 vs all fetal groups examined). Collec-\ntively, our data suggest that MGL plays an essential role in deter-\nmining 2-AG availability in the developing nervous system.\n13994 \u2022 J.

Our present histochem-\nical findings, however, place the primary site ofMGL synthesis in\nthe developing thalamus. We performed quantitative real-time\nPCR (qPCR) analysis to support spatial differences in 2-AG syn-\nthesis and degradation. In embryonic cortices and thalami iso-\nlated at E16.5 (n \u0005 4), we have found that MGL mRNA levels\n(1.17 \u0007 0.07; unscaled normalized values throughout) signifi-\ncantly exceed those found in the cerebral cortex (0.85 \u0007 0.04)\nwhen normalized to GAPDH ( p \u0005 0.009) (Fig. 2A). Similarly,\nDAGL\u0002 mRNA expression was also significantly higher in the\nthalamus (1.09\u0007 0.03) than in the cerebral cortex (0.81\u0007 0.05;\np \u0005 0.003) (Fig. 2B). Conspicuously, DAGL\u0001 coexists with\nDAGL\u0002 at E16.5 (Fig. 2C) and exhibits similar regional variations\n(0.95\u0007 0.02 for thalamus vs 0.055\u0007 0.03 for cortex; p\u0006 0.001).\nIn contrast, CB1R mRNA levels in the cerebral cortex exceed\nthose in thalamus (0.88 \u0007 0.06 for thalamus vs 1.08 \u0007 0.05 for\ncortex; p\u0005 0.035) (Fig. 2D).\nNext, we have performed qPCR analysis of primary cortical\nand thalamic neurons isolated at E16.5 andmaintained for 4 DIV\nto validate subsequent cell biology studies (see Figs. 5\u20139) in cor-\ntical neurons endogenously expressingMGL, CB1R, and DAGLs.\nWe show that both neuron populations maintain their cellular\nspecificities of expressing molecular components of the 2-AG\nsignaling cassette (n \u0005 2) (Fig. 2A\b\u2013D\b) compared with data\nobtained in vivo (Fig. 2A\u2013D).\nTo further dissect whether expression ofmetabolic and recep-\ntor components of the 2-AG signaling system at the protein level\nis temporally coordinated, we analyzed pallial\/cortical tissues\n(Fig. 2E\u2013E3) and subpallial\/striatal specimens (supplemental Fig.\n5, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) by\nWestern blotting. We demonstrate that the 33 kDa isoform of\nMGL is selectively expressed in embryonic brain tissue (Fig. 2E).\nComparative analysis of this isoform from E14.5 to P1 supports\n4\n(Figure legend continued.) photographed at E14.5 reveals MGL\u0002 axons in the trigeminal\nganglion (5Gn), submandibular trigeminal nerves (5man), and spinal trigeminal tract (sp5; C2),\noptic stalk (os), parabrachial\/microcellular tegmental nuclei (PB\/MiTg;C3), and thalamocortical\n(arrowheads) and olfactory tracts (1n). Open arrowheads indicate MGL\u0002 subventricular zone\nprogenitors. D\u2013D4, MGL\n\u0002 TCAs course in the inferior thalamic radiation (D1) before invading\nthe cortical subplate (D2, arrows). D1, MGL\n\u0002 axons at the anterodorsal thalamic boundary are\nintermingled with GABAergic neurons. D2, Radially migrating cortical neurons, presumed py-\nramidal cells, also express MGL.

E\u2013E2, MGL\n\u0002 axons populate the cortical IZ, hip-\npocampal fimbria (f), lateral olfactory tract (lot), and optic nerves (och) by E16.5.

In contrast, DAGL\u0001 expression\npeaks at E14.5\/E16.5 with a dramatic decrease in DAGL\u0001 protein\nconcentrations in neonates [E14.5, 14.41 \u0007 6.21 vs P1 (hip-\npocampus), 0.96 \u0007 0.34 (values were normalized to P1 cortical\nlevels); p\u0005 0.044] (Fig. 2E1,E2) (supplemental Fig. 5A1,A2, avail-\nable at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). CB1R pro-\ntein levels are essentially unchanged throughout forebrain\ndevelopment (Fig. 2E1,E3) (supplemental Fig. 5A1,A3, available at\nwww.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).\nCRIP1a can interact with the distal C terminus of CB1R\n(Niehaus et al., 2007) and may attenuate CB1R-mediated inhibi-\ntion of voltage-gated Ca2\u0002 channels. However, the developmen-\ntal expression profile of CRIP1a in relation to CB1Rs is unknown.\nWe show that CRIP1a protein levels (supplemental Fig. 1, avail-\nable at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) are dynam-\nically regulated in the developing nervous system with a\nprogressive increase in cortical [E14.5, 0.57 \u0007 0.27 vs P1 (hip-\npocampus), 1.24\u0007 0.28 (normalized to CRIP1a levels in P1 cor-\ntex); p \u0005 0.005] (Fig. 2E1,E3) and subpallial CRIP1a\nconcentrations by birth [E14.5, 0.44 \u0007 0.07 vs P1, 1.0 \u0007 0.00\n(normalized); p\u0005 0.040] (supplemental Fig. 5A1,A3, available at\nwww.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Overall, these ex-\nperiments indicate that 2-AGmetabolic enzymes andCB1R levels\nare controlled at both the mRNA and protein levels in vivo.\nCB1Rs in growth cones of cortical pyramidal neurons\nCB1Rs have hitherto been demonstrated to accumulate in growth\ncones ofGABAergic interneurons (Berghuis et al., 2007) aswell as\nin the shaft of CFAs emanating from pyramidal cells (Berghuis et\nal., 2007; Vitalis et al., 2008). However, the presence of CB1Rs in\nmotile growth cones of cortical pyramidal cells is ambiguous.We\nstudied CB1R distribution at the ultrastructural level by corre-\nlated light and electron microscopy. We find that CB1R\n\u0002 axons\nare emitted earlier than thought previously (\u0005E13) (Fig. 3A).\nCB1Rs are distributed along the shafts and growth cones of CFAs\nthat depart the cortical intermediate zone (IZ) and transit the\ninternal capsule (Fig. 3A,A1). CB1R\n\u0002 axons navigate in the neu-\nropil of the internal capsule separately from each other (Fig. 3A1).\nCB1Rs are transported in small vesicles along the axon (Fig. 3B)\nand concentrate in motile filopodia that protrude at random\nfrom individual growth cones (Fig. 3C,C1). Pathfinding decisions\nby CB1R\n\u0002 growth cones do not rely on the alignment of CB1R\n\u0002\naxons with each other as we detected using electron microscopy\nwith three-dimensional reconstruction (Fig. 3A2,C,C1). Thus,\nCB1R expression during CFA tract formation is poised to allow\neCBs to influence both the elongation and growth cone steering\ndecisions of excitatory cortical efferents.\nOur present and previous (Berghuis et al., 2007; Mulder et al.,\n2008) findings suggest that CB1Rs are selectively expressed by\ncortical neurons, including pyramidal cells, and can affect the\nelongation and guidance of CFAs. We tested this notion by elec-\ntroporating cortical pyramidal cells and thalamic projection neu-\nrons with an EGFP vector in utero. Our data demonstrate that\nCB1Rs are present in CFAs coursing deep in the IZ (Fig. 3D1\u2013d3)\nbut absent from superficial TCAs (Fig. 3E1\u2013e3). By using high-\nresolution laser-scanning microscopy, we clearly show colocal-\nization of pyramidal cell-derived EGFP and CB1R signals (Fig.\n3d1\b\u2013d3\b) while revealing a mutually exclusive distribution pat-\ntern of CB1Rs and EGFP expressed by thalamic neurons (Fig.\n3e1\b\u2013e3\b). Overall, our results define the axonal specificity of\nCB1Rs during corticogenesis.\nMGL and CB1Rs are coexpressed in corticofugal but not\nthalamocortical axons\nThe presence of MGL mRNA in the cerebral cortex suggests that\nMGL expression persists in developing cortical neurons. We ex-\namined MGL expression by cortical pyramidal cells by analyzing\nwhether MGL colocalizes with CB1Rs (Fig. 4A) that we have\ncharacterized as a specific pallial marker (Fig. 3D3). High-\nresolution microscopy revealed that pyramidal cells populating\nthe cortical plate at E16.5 harbor both MGL and CB1R immuno-\nreactivities (Fig. 4A1). Accordingly, MGL\n\u0002\/CB1R\n\u0002 axons popu-\nlated the IZ of the cerebral cortex (Fig. 4A2). We observed that\nMGL\u0002 axons aremore numerous in the IZ than those containing\nCB1Rs [area occupancy (percentage of region of interest), 31.7\u0007\n3.0% (CB1R\n\u0002) vs 68.4\u0007 3.0% (MGL\u0002)] (Fig. 4C), with 6.7\u0007\n1.3% of MGL\u0002 axons also containing CB1Rs. Conversely,\n13.1 \u0007 2.0% of CB1R\n\u0002 axonal profiles harbored MGL immu-\nnoreactivity (Fig. 4C1).\nIn the thalamus, however, MGL\u0002 axonal profiles were far\nmore frequently encountered than CB1R\n\u0002 profiles [area occu-\npancy (percentage of region of interest), 94.7\u0007 2.0% (MGL\u0002) vs\n5.3 \u0007 2.0% (CB1R\n\u0002)] (Fig. 4B\u2013B1\t,C). Only 1.0 \u0007 0.1% of\nMGL\u0002 axons contained CB1Rs, whereas 17.9 \u0007 4.8% of CB1R-\ncontaining axonal profiles were dual labeled (Fig. 4C1). The Pear-\nson\u2019s correlation coefficient of dual-labeled structures did not\ndiffer from R \u0005 0, suggesting a lack of a direct relationship (co-\nregulation) of CB1R andMGL levels in individual axonal profiles\n(Fig. 4C2).\nWe found that MGL\u0002 and CB1R\n\u0002 axons are spatially segre-\ngated in the fimbria hippocampi (Fig. 4D). In fact, the fimbria\ncan be subdivided into ventrolateral\/CB1R\n\u0002, median\/mixed, and\ndorsomedial\/MGL\u0002 domains in coronal sections (Fig. 4D1\u2013D3).\nWe have confirmed this notion by quantitative morphometry\nshowing inverse MGL\/CB1R colocalization probabilities in these\ndomains (Fig. 4D4). Together, these findings suggest that CB1Rs\ncan coexist with MGL in CFAs. In contrast, the overwhelming\nmajority of TCAs only contain MGL (Fig. 4E). Therefore, we\nsuggest that TCAs can function as 2-AG-inactivating barriers to\nshape forward-facing 2-AG gradients, to minimize 2-AG \u201cspill-\nover\u201d and to promote CFA pathfinding.\nCB1Rs are indispensable for axon fasciculation but\ndispensable for DAGL\u0001 orMGL expression and axonal\ntargeting\nThe physiological outcome of eCB signaling is determined hier-\narchically byCB1Rs being available at the cell surface (Hsieh et al.,\n1999), their differential recruitment of signal transduction path-\nways (Derkinderen et al., 2003), as well as the momentary meta-\nbolic balance between 2-AG synthesis (DAGL) and degrading\n(MGL) activities. Our present and previous data (Mulder et al.,\n2008) together establish that MGL is coexpressed and cotargeted\nwith CB1Rs and DAGLs in CFAs at midgestation. The coincident\npresence of enzymatic and receptor components of 2-AG signal-\ning in CFAs allows us to address whether DAGL\u0001 and MGL\nexpression and axonal targeting in fasciculating CFAs are linked\nto CB1Rs. We tested this possibility in E16.5 CB1R\n\u0001\/\u0001 mice that\nexhibit enlarged CFA fascicles relative to their age-matched wild-\ntype littermates (Mulder et al., 2008). We validated that CB1R\nactivity in CFAs is indispensable for appropriately timed axonal\nelongation and fasciculation to occur as enlarged CFA fascicles\nKeimpema et al. \u2022Metabolic Control of 2-AG Signaling in Axons J. Neurosci., October 20, 2010 \u2022 30(42):13992\u201314007 \u2022 13997\ncan be seen in CB1R\n\u0001\/\u0001mice when local-\nizing both DAGL\u0001 and MGL (Fig. 5).\nNext, we have explored whether the\nCB1R itself and\/or the redundancy of\nsignaling-competent 2-AG in the absence\nof its cognate receptor can affect DAGL\u0001\nor MGL expression and CFA targeting.\nNeither DAGL\u0001 (Fig. 5B\u2013B1\b) nor MGL\n(Fig. 5C\u2013C1\b) expression in cortical terri-\ntories is dependent on CB1Rs. In fact, the\nbundledCFAphenotype inCB1R\n\u0001\/\u0001mice\namplifies the presence of both enzymes\notherwise sparsely distributed in axons\nwith parallel trajectories in wild-type\ncortices (Fig. 5B1\b,C1\b). Although we\ncannot exclude subtle alterations to the\ntemporal control of DAGL and\/or MGL\nexpression or degradation in the ab-\nsence of CB1Rs, our findings suggest\nthat CB1R does not exert significant up-\nstream control of DAGL\u0001 and MGL ex-\npression at midgestation.\nMutually exclusive subcellular\ndistribution of DAGL\u0001 and\nMGL in developing axons\nAny guidance cue or elongation factor\nrequires a discrete subcellular niche,\nparticularly the growth cone, in which\ntemporally and spatially restricted ligand\u2013\nreceptor interactions can occur and trans-\nlate into a growth response. eCB signaling\nhas unique properties because this ligand\nfamily is lipophilic and can diffuse in bio-\nlogical membranes over significant dis-\ntances (Chevaleyre et al., 2006) and exert\ntheir action, at least in part, through cell-\nautonomous mechanisms (Mulder et al.,\n2008). We hypothesized therefore that\n2-AG synthesis by DAGL\u0001\/DAGL\u0002\n(Mulder et al., 2008) must exceed MGL-\ndependent 2-AG degradation in axonal\ngrowth cones to generate 2-AG-rich\nhotspots for directional axonal growth.\nIndividual axons developing in vitro\nprovide a suitable model to assess this\nhypothesis by allowing precise, corre-\nlated localization of DAGLs andMGL as\nthey elongate. Maturation of cortical\nneurons is not only characterized by the\nspatial expansion of their axons but also\nby the appearance of varicose structures\n(Dotti et al., 1988), with each varicosity\nrecognized as a functionally active sig-\nnaling entity.\nIn cortical cultures with elaborate yet\nimmature axonal meshworks (4 DIV), DAGL\u0001 andMGL coexist\nin presynaptic varicosities (Fig. 6A,A1). However, DAGL\u0001 is\nreduced in presynapse-like varicosities (Fig. 6B) once synapto-\ngenesis concludes (Mulder et al., 2008). In contrast, MGL retains\nits presynaptic localization both within fasciculating axons (Fig.\n6C) and VAMP2\u0002 (synaptobrevin 2\u0002) presynapses, whether\nautaptic or heterotaptic (Fig. 6D,D1), thus recapitulating the\ndistribution of MGL in adult brain (Dinh et al., 2002; Gulyas\net al., 2004).\nSubcellular analysis revealed that MGL accumulates in tubu-\nlin\u0002 consolidating axon shaftswith its levels tailing off toward the\nactin-rich motile axon tip leaving a \u201cbarrier region\u201d of 9\u201312 \u0004m\nwith low MGL levels (termed \u201cMGL delay\u201d throughout) (Fig.\n6E\u2013E3). To gain insights into the temporal dynamics of axonal\nFigure 3. CB1Rs in corticofugal afferents.

Elongating axons retain MGL\nin their stable proximal segments (Fig. 6E1) with a surprisingly\nsteep decrement of MGL toward their actin\u0002 distal tip (Fig.\n6E1,E1\b). Compartmentalized MGL distribution is a fundamen-\ntal hallmark of axon development and is independent of themor-\nphology\u2014whether bundled, spread, or looped (Morii et al.,\n2006)\u2014of coexisting growth cones (Fig. 6E2\u2013E3\b). Notably, sub-\ncellular DAGL\u0001 andMGL localization is significantly different in\nmotile growth cones with DAGL\u0001 but not MGL being present\n(Fig. 6F,G). In conclusion, DAGL\u0001 and MGL exhibit mutually\nexclusive distribution in motile neurites, in which the exclusion\nof MGL from the growth cone defines a subcellular niche for\nprotrusive 2-AG signaling.\nProteasomal degradation is a candidate mechanism to\nexcludeMGL from growth cones\nThe ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) has been implicated in\ndefining dynamic structural rearrangements during axonal\ngrowth (Haas and Broadie, 2008). Preferential UPS-mediated\ndegradation of cytoskeletal and signalosome complexes under-\nscores the continuous structural reorganization within the\ngrowth cone during its steering decisions (Campbell and Holt,\n2001). The restricted localization of MGL to the immobile axon\nshaft led us to hypothesize that MGL degradation in the motile\nneurite tip could maintain the sensitivity of the growth cone to\n2-AG. Bioinformatic tools (http:\/\/elm.eu.org) predict a destruc-\ntion box motif (D-box) in MGL, suggesting that MGL could be\ndegraded by the 20S proteasome within the motile axon ending.\nWe have experimentally tested whether compartmentalized pro-\nteasomal degradation contributes to the axonal gradient of MGL\nFigure 4.

We find that UPS inhibition disrupts MGL distribution\nsuch thatMGL becomes indiscriminately present in the axon and\ndendrites (Fig. 7B,C) and ventures into growth cones (Fig.\n7C2,C3). Fluorescence intensity distribution analysis of MGL\n\u0002\naxons revealed that UPS inhibition dissipates the spatial segrega-\ntion of MGL\u0002 (established) and actin\u0002 (motile) axon segments\n(Fig. 7D,E5). EctopicMGLaccumulation is observed in dendrites\nduring lactacystin-induced disruption of MGL turnover (Fig.\n7C,F\u2013H1).\nIf 2-AG hydrolysis by MGL impedes axonal growth, then dis-\nrupting the subcellular distribution of MGL will shorten axon\nlength. Although an impaired UPS can increase the bioavailabil-\nity of many proteins pivotal for axonal growth and thus disturb\ncombinatorial signaling in growth cones, we argued that our\nmodel allows testing the premise that a molecular link between\nMGL stabilization in axons and discordant neurite outgrowth\ncan exist. We find that UPS inhibition reduces the length of the\nlead neurite (Fig. 7E1) and prunes both axon collateral complex-\nity (Fig. 7B,C,E2) and dendritogenesis (Fig. 7H) of cortical neu-\nrons. These findings suggest that MGL turnover is differentially\nregulated in the motile and consolidated axon segments and can\naffect axonal elongation.\nSynaptogenesis disrupts the axonal MGL microgradient\nAlthough MGL primarily avoids the motile neurite segment, it\naccumulates in presynapses of cultured neurons (Fig. 8) as well as\nmany presynaptic terminals of the adult cerebral cortex (Dinh et\nal., 2002; Gulyas et al., 2004; Kano et al., 2009). This presents the\npossibility that MGL redistribution in the growth cone is physi-\nologically relevant to decrease the velocity of 2-AG-induced mo-\ntility when a growth cone approaches its postsynaptic target.\nTherefore, we have determined whether subcellular MGL distri-\nbution changes during synaptogenesis. We find that MGL accu-\nmulates in growth cones that appose a postsynaptic neuron in\nvitro (Fig. 8A\u2013B3) (supplemental Fig. 6A,D\u2013D2, available at\nwww.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). In contrast,\ngrowth cones of axon collaterals who have not selected a target\nremain MGL\u0001 (Fig. 8A) (supplemental Fig. 6A\u2013C2). These data\nsuggest that the axonal polarity of MGL dissipates and MGL can\nlimit 2-AG signaling as a growth cone engages in its postsynaptic\ntarget selection (Fig. 8C,C1).\nMGL inhibition induces axonal growth\nAlthough evidence is accumulating that CB1Rs affect (in isolation\nor synergistically with other receptors) axonal growth and steer-\ning decisions, evidence on the molecular identity of the eCB re-\nquired for axonal growth is still lacking.Our findings could imply\nthat 2-AGmay function as an axonal elongation signal.We tested\nthis possibility by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of MGL with\nJZL184 (100 nM), a selective MGL inhibitor (Long et al., 2009).\nExposure to JZL184 (16 h) invariably triggers neurite outgrowth\nin both cells that emit a stunted quiescent axon shortly after\nplating (Fig. 9A\u2013B2) and neurons with an established primary\nneurite in vitro (Fig. 9C\u2013C2). We have confirmed these data by\napplying URB 602 (5 \u0004M), an alternative MGL inhibitor (King et\nal., 2007), whose application also increases axonal growth (data\nnot shown). Notably, MGL inhibition regulates neither the\nlength of the actin\u0002distal neurite segment (Fig. 9B2,C2) nor com-\npartmentalized MGL distribution (data not shown) in axons,\nthus suggesting thatMGL inactivation does not directly influence\nMGL degradation.\nOverall, our data suggest that MGL exerts dual functions dur-\ning axonal growth: MGL may form an intracellular barrier keep-\ning lipophilic 2-AG from diffusing retrogradely from the growth\ncone in the axonal plasma membrane to prematurely engage\nCB1Rs and induce ectopic growth responses (Fig. 8C,C1). In ad-\ndition, the exclusion of MGL from the motile neurite tip could\nallow for cell-autonomous or target-derived 2-AG to selectively\nimpact the growth cone and trigger axonal elongation in a coor-\ndinated manner.\n2-AG is one of the many potential targets of MGL in vivo\n(Nomura et al., 2010). It is therefore possible that MGL hydro-\nlyzes a ligand distinct from 2-AG to regulate axonal elongation.\nTo exclude this possibility, we treated neurons with JZL184 in\ncombination with O-3841 or THL, DAGL inhibitors.

A repulsive response of motile growth cones will invari-\nably couple to axonal elongation because directional growth is\nrequired to avoid the chemorepulsive cue.

In\nsummary, our data reconcile that 2-AG can act as both a direc-\ntional cue (Berghuis et al., 2007) and an elongation factor while\nsculpting axonal complexity.\nDiscussion\nMGL in the developing nervous system\nThe prevailing view that eCBs, particularly 2-AG, exert many\nfunctions in the developing nervous system is underscored by a\nrapidly expanding cohort of experimental studies demonstrating\neCB-dependent neural progenitor self-renewal and neurogenic\ncommitment (Aguado et al., 2005, 2006; Goncalves et al., 2008),\nlong-range as well as local neuronal migration (Berghuis et al.,\n2005; Morozov et al., 2009) and synaptogenesis (Berghuis et al.,\n2007). eCB signaling is likely to coexist and cooperate with sig-\nnaling cascades indispensable for neuronal identification, includ-\ning neurotrophins (Maison et al., 2009) and chemokines (Zorina\net al., 2010). Compelling evidence indicates that both DAGL-\ndependent 2-AG synthesis and CB1R-dependent signal transduc-\ntion are under cell-state-specific regulatory control of BDNF\n(Maison et al., 2009) and FGF receptor signaling cascades (Williams\net al., 2003). It is not surprising therefore that eCBactions underpin-\nFigure 7. Proteasomal degradation excludes MGL from the motile neurite segment.

The precision of 2-AG signaling in a neurodevelopmen-\ntal context is emphasized by the translocation of DAGLs from\naxonal tracts once synaptogenesis concludes (Bisogno et al.,\n2003) to dendritic spines apposing mature presynapses to main-\ntain retrograde signaling (Katona et al., 2006; Yoshida et al.,\n2006). 2-AG degradation by MGL, and probably also by ABHD6\nand ABHD12 lipases (Blankman et al., 2007; Hashimotodani et\nal., 2007; Straiker et al., 2009), is critical tomaintain the temporal\ndynamics of retrograde synaptic communication and the sensi-\ntivity of presynaptic CB1Rs to activity-dependent transient peaks\nof extracellular 2-AG concentrations. It is therefore physiologi-\ncally necessary to place MGL into the presynapse (Gulyas et al.,\n2004) in which it can rapidly terminate 2-AG signaling\n(Hashimotodani et al., 2007).\nDynamic subcellular recruitment of\nboth metabolic and receptor components\nof 2-AG signaling networks in the devel-\noping nervous system is achieved through\ncell-autonomous programming of both\nthe expression and subcellular sorting of\nDAGLs, MGL, and CB1Rs. We find that\nMGL is coincidently expressed with\nCB1Rs and DAGLs by E12 in mouse, thus\nproviding critical hydrolytic activity to\nterminate undesired 2-AG actions when\nthe telencephalic SVZ progenitor pool be-\ngins to expand. The differential recruit-\nment of MGL to distinct subcellular\ndomains of neurons, particularly the con-\nsolidated axon shaft, provides an appeal-\ning candidate for the cell-autonomous\nregulation of 2-AG-dependent positional\nactivation of CB1Rs. In fact, neurons can\nspatially confine their 2-AG-inactivating\nenzymatic capacity intracellularly such\nthat CB1Rs are kept inactive while under-\ngoing vesicular transport along the axon\neven in the presence of membrane-\ndiffusible 2-AG. Because agonist activa-\ntion of CB1Rs can result in surplus neurite\nbranching in vitro (Mulder et al., 2008),\nthe molecular arrangements we uncov-\nered suggest that MGL activity in the\nimmotile axon shaft is required and suf-\nficient to prevent discordant signaling\nevents that could manifest in ectopic\nbranching and axon guidance errors.\nTransient removal of MGL from ax-\nonal tracts during the perinatal period\n(E18.5 to P2) may have intriguing physi-\nological implications. The arrest of MGL\nin neuronal perikarya and dendrites coin-\ncideswith a previously reported, yet unex-\nplained, peak (up to \n9 ng\/g tissue) in\nperinatal tissue 2-AG levels (Berrendero\net al., 1999). Our analysis significantly ex-\ntends these observations by showing that\n2-AG levels are increased as a result of a\ntransient lack of 2-AG hydrolysis capacity\nin the neonatal hippocampus (up to\n45\nng\/g tissue) with minor changes in other\nbrain regions. We suggest that the neonatal 2-AG peak in the\nhippocampus can provide a mechanism to mute synaptic infor-\nmation processing, thus preventing memory formation during\ndelivery.\nAn \n1000-fold excess of tissue 2-AG concentrations over\nthose of AEA exists in the fetal brain (Berrendero et al., 1999).\nThis observation together with our detailed understanding of the\nmetabolic network controlling 2-AG bioavailability (Bisogno et\nal., 2003; Nomura et al., 2010) prompted the molecular dissec-\ntion of neurodevelopmental 2-AG signaling. Nevertheless, in\nvitro data (Aguado et al., 2005; Berghuis et al., 2005;Mulder et al.,\n2008) convincingly demonstrate that AEA can also elicit phys-\niologically relevant CB1R-mediated responses in developing\nneurons. AEA may also be involved in fine-tuning 2-AG bio-\navailability (Maccarrone et al., 2008). Hence, we expect future\nstudies to unravel AEA-specific signaling events and add an ad-\nFigure8.

In contrast, CB1Rs\nare absent from MGL\u0002 TCAs. We attribute the scarce coexist-\nence of MGL\u0002\/CB1R\n\u0002 axonal profiles in thalamic territories to\nCTAs invading particular nuclei. The remarkable neurochemical\ndichotomy of CFAs and TCAs in the context of 2-AG signaling\nled us to propose novel roles for 2-AG signaling during the\n\u201chandshake\u201d of these axons. The handshake hypothesis implies\nthat axons from the thalamus and from early-born cortical pre-\nplate cells meet and intermingle in the basal telencephalon, after\nwhich thalamic axons use the scaffold of CFAs to enter the corti-\ncal plate (Molna\u00b4r and Blakemore, 1995). Our findings provide an\nadditional facet of information to this hypothesis by identifying\nMGL-mediated 2-AG inactivation in TCAs as a mechanism to\nlimit unwanted 2-AG spillover likely masking steep local ligand\nmicrogradients, to refine the extracellular 2-AG microgradient\nmap, and to determine CB1R-dependent directional CFA growth\n(Fig. 4E). The ability of 2-AG to act as an extracellular guidance\nsignal is suggested by impaired retrograde signaling inDAGL\u0001\/\u0001\nFigure9.

CB1R\nactivation in axonal growth cones of cortical neurons has been\nshown previously to induce chemorepulsive steering decisions\nwhen presenting an extracellular ligandmicrogradient (Berghuis\net al., 2007). Because both attractive and repulsive extracellular\nguidance cues must elicit cytoskeletal remobilization of the distal\n(motile) axon segment to facilitate axonal elongation (either to-\nward or away from the source of the guidance molecule), CB1R-\ndependent repulsive growth cone turning ultimately relies on the\ndirectional extension of themotile axon segment (Berghuis et al.,\n2007), with RhoA GTPases triggering cytoskeletal remodeling in\nthe navigating growth cone.\nExposing neurons to homogenously distributed ligands, such\nas the bath-applied enzyme inhibitors or CB1R agonists used\nhere, will evoke neurite outgrowth. However, bath application\nwill eliminate the ability of the chemotropic ligand to evoke di-\nrectional growth responses. Instead, axonal trajectories will be\nchaotic in the absence of discrete synthesis and release sites.\nTherefore, the experimental paradigm we used will only allow us\nto study whether 2-AG can promote axonal growth per se. Be-\ncause MGL inhibition by JZL184 couples to an axonal growth\nresponse, we conclude that 2-AG clearly possesses such a capacity\nwhen engaging CB1Rs in growth cones. It is noteworthy that\nJZL184-treated neurons exhibit axonal growth cone morpholo-\ngies reminiscent of those seen after gradient CB1R activation\n(Berghuis et al., 2007): a clear reduction in the number of filop-\nodia as well as in the surface size of growth cones argues that\nmassive growth cone remodeling occurs when 2-AG levels be-\ncome elevated. Our finding that O-3841 but not THL reinstates\nthe size and filopodial complexity of axonal growth cones hints\nthat these antagonists may differentially affect DAGL\u0001 or\nDAGL\u0002 and can have different efficacies to block 2-AG synthesis\nor off-target effects [e.g., THL can inhibit ABHD12 (Hoover et\nal., 2008)] in developing neurons.\nOverall, our data strongly suggest that 2-AG signaling exerts\ndual roles in developing neurons by impacting both growth cone\nnavigation and axonal elongation. In this regard, the refined pro-\nteasomal regulation of MGL might not only contribute to the\nmaintenance of axonal 2-AGmicrogradients but can also rapidly\nreconfigureMGLdistribution to occlude protrusive 2-AG signal-\ning. Such a mechanism can be particularly powerful to act as a\nhalting signal to prevent aberrant elongation of an axon beyond\nits physiologically appropriate postsynaptic target. Notably,\nMGL stabilization (\u201coverexpression\u201d) and inhibition inversely\nmodulate 2-AG availability, which translates into a differential\naxon growth response regardless of the stage of axon develop-\nment. The magnitude of axonal growth we observed cannot be\naugmented by prolonged MGL inhibition, suggesting CB1R de-\nsensitization or accelerated receptor recycling and removal\n(Hsieh et al., 1999) once 2-AG levels reach a critical supraphysi-\nological threshold.\nMGL is generally viewed to degrade 2-AG in the brain.\nHowever, Nomura et al. (2010) have reported recently that\nMGL can degrade a broad variety of bioactive monoacylglyc-\nerols. Therefore, we suggest that the developmentally defined\ncomposition of the substrate pool of MGL will determine its\nmetabolic significance. Our experiments cumulatively suggest\nthat the primary target of MGL to modulate axonal growth\nand guidance is an endogenous CB1R agonist synthesized by\nDAGLs. Although we cannot entirely exclude the contribution\nof alternative monoacylglycerols to developmental processes,\nthe above molecular characteristics together with an in vivo\ninverse relationship between neonatal MGL expression and\ntissue 2-AG concentrations suggest that 2-AG can be a physi-\nologically relevant candidate to mediate axonal growth re-\nsponses. Assuming that subcellular accumulation of DAGLs\nandMGL directly reflect their increased focal enzymatic activ-\nity, we conclude that the developmental role of MGL is to\nsculpt the spatial dynamics of 2-AG-rich hotspots, allow-\ning 2-AG to function as a local protrusive signal facilitating\nneurite elongation. Thus, the spatiotemporal control of 2-AG\nmetabolism is a key determinant of eCB signaling during\nestablishment of the wiring diagram in cortical neuronal\nnetworks, and modifications to the subcellular control of\neCB actions may be intrinsic to the pathogenesis of congenital\ndisorders associated with aberrant telencephalic axon patterning.\nReferences\nAguado T, Monory K, Palazuelos J, Stella N, Cravatt B, Lutz B, Marsicano\nG, Kokaia Z, Guzma\u00b4n M, Galve-Roperh I (2005) The endocannabi-\nnoid system drives neural progenitor proliferation.
