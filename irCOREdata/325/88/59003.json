However, information on \nthe long-term development of field margin plant communities remains limited. We describe a \nlong-term experiment on the effects of field margin management on biodiversity and weed \nspecies. Swards were established by natural regeneration or sowing a grass and wildflower seed \nmixture, and treatments manipulated the frequency and timing of mowing, application of \nherbicide and leaving of hay. Vegetation was monitored to evaluate the extent to which early \nconclusions remained valid after 13 years. Although early successional trends suggested that \nnaturally regenerated swards would rapidly become dominated by pernicious perennial weeds, \nand that sown swards would exclude such species, neither was true in the longer term. Sown \nswards were eventually invaded by unsown perennials, but they remained distinct from naturally \nregenerated swards.  Plant species richness declined throughout the experiment. Annuals were lost \nmost rapidly from sown swards but, under natural regeneration, loss could be modified by \nmowing. Perennial species initially increased during natural regeneration before stabilising. In \nsown swards they declined under all treatments. Species richness in naturally regenerating swards \nwas promoted initially by mowing twice annually. After 13 years, timing and frequency of \nmowing had no significant effect on species richness although it still influenced sward \ncomposition. Leaving cut hay lying produced species-poor swards. We conclude that the choice of \nestablishment and management methods for arable field margins significantly affects the long-\nterm conservation value of the swards.  \n \nKey words: agriculture, biodiversity, agri-environment schemes, weed control, mowing regimes, \nspecies richness \n 2\n1.

In the UK, the potential value of arable field margins has been recognised by the UK \nBiodiversity Steering Group (Anon, 1995a,b). Widespread degradation and loss of field margins \nduring the agricultural intensification of the second half of the 20th century (e.g. Chapman and \nSheail, 1994; Haines-Young et al., 2000; Sotherton and Self, 2000; Chamberlain et al., 2000) has \ngenerated many policy initiatives over the last twenty years.  \n \nRecent reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy are encouraging European Union member \nstates to switch their farm support mechanism from production-based subsidies to payments \nconditional on cross-compliance with EU environmental directives (e.g. Ovenden, Swash and \nSmallshire, 1998; Primdahl et al., 2003). Agri-environment schemes provide incentives for further \nimprovements (Radley, O\u2019Reilly and Jowitt, 2005) and their implementation is currently \nconsidered the most important policy instrument through which to reverse widespread \nbiodiversity declines across European agricultural landscapes (Donald and Evans, 2006). In the \nUK, over five million hectares of land are now covered by Environmental Stewardship \nagreements (Defra, 2008). This two-tier scheme has a range of environmental objectives, \nincluding wildlife conservation, with both tiers incorporating options for restoration and \nmanagement of uncropped field margins.  \n \nRecognition of the importance of field margins for biodiversity conservation triggered many \nresearch initiatives designed to inform prescriptions for their restoration and management \n(Vickery, Feber and Fuller, 2009). Many of these have been short- term and have focussed on \n 3\nearly successional stages of habitat re-creation (e.g. Marshall and Nowakowski, 1995; Huusela-\nVeistola and Vasarainen, \n79 \n2000; De Cauwer et al., 2005). The new generation of agri-environment \nschemes has a longer-term focus (with agreements of either five years (Entry Level Stewardship) \nor ten years (Higher Level Stewardship agreements)) and corresponding requirement for long-\nterm research.  \n80 \n81 \n82 \n83 \n84 \n85 \n86 \n87 \n88 \n89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \n100 \n101 \n102 \n103 \n104 \n105 \n \nWhile there have been many studies of successional processes on set aside (e.g. Critchley and \nFowbert, 2000; Firbank et al., 2003) and grassland restoration on former arable land (e.g. van der \nPutten et al., 2000; Pywell et al., 2002; Walker et al., 2004; Donath et al., 2007), few studies have \nspecifically concerned sward development on arable field margins over the longer term (e.g. \nBokenstrand et al., 2004). This is surprising given the evidence that relatively small differences in \nfield margin establishment and initial management can result in significant differences to the \ndeveloping plant (Smith, McCallum and Macdonald, 1997; Critchley et al., 2004; de Cauwer et \nal., 2005, Westbury et al., 2008) and invertebrate (Feber et al., 1996; Baines et al., 1998; Asteraki \net al., 2004; Smith et al. 2008; Woodcock et al., 2008) communities.  Studies in other grassland \ncommunities have shown that short-term changes do not necessarily predict long-term \ncomposition (e.g. Gibson and Brown, 1992). The method of field margin establishment and \nsubsequent management will have significant consequences for the performance of individual \nspecies and the conservation value of the resulting sward, and financial and practical implications \nfor the farmer. Elucidating the broad principles of long-term change that are likely to occur in \narable field margin composition will help enable ecologically appropriate and cost-effective \ndecisions to be made at the outset. \n \nA large-scale, long-term field experiment at the University of Oxford\u2019s Farm at Wytham, Oxford, \nprovided a unique opportunity to answer key questions about succession on field margins adjacent \nto intensively farmed arable land, and timely guidance for new incentive schemes. The \nexperiment was established in 1987 to evaluate the impact on wildlife, and the implications for \n 4\n106 \n107 \n108 \n109 \n110 \n111 \n112 \n113 \n114 \n115 \n116 \n117 \n118 \n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \n124 \n125 \n126 \n127 \n128 \n130 \n131 \ncrop husbandry, of simple and practical regimes for managing permanent grassy margins around \nconventionally-farmed fields. The field margins were established on former cultivated field edges \neither by sowing a wild grass and forb mixture or by allowing natural regeneration. The \ndevelopment of plant species richness, and the fate of key individual species of agricultural \nconcern and conservation interest, was monitored intensively during the establishment phase of \nthe experiment, until 1990. The experiment was maintained for a further ten years and the \nvegetation recorded again in 2000.  \n \nIn this paper we use these data to examine the role of the management regimes in determining the \nspecies richness and composition of the swards 13 years after their establishment and test the \nextent to which our conclusions about effective sward management from the early years remained \nrelevant.  In particular we addressed the following questions: \nAre early trends in succession a guide to longer term species composition? \nDoes sowing a grass and wildflower seed mixture promote higher species richness than natural \nregeneration and are these species more or less valuable for wider aspects of biodiversity?  \nTo what extent can species richness and composition of sown and naturally regenerated swards be \nmanipulated by simple mowing regimes in the medium term? \nHow long do weed populations persist and does this differ with management regime? \n \nWe discuss the implications of our results for the restoration of diverse and attractive permanent \ngrass margins around arable fields and, more generically, of other grassland establishment on \nformer arable land.  \n \n2. Methods 129 \nTwo metre wide uncropped margins were created around six arable fields at the Oxford University \nFarm, Wytham, UK (1\u02da19\u2019 W 51\u02da47\u2019 N) in autumn 1987. They comprised the original (pre-existing) \n 5\nuncropped field margin (approximately 0.5m wide), and a ca 1.5m wide fallowed extension onto \ncultivated land. The fallowed margin extension is the subject of this paper.  \n132 \n133 \n134 \n135 \n136 \n137 \n138 \n139 \n140 \n141 \n142 \n143 \n144 \n145 \n146 \n147 \n148 \n149 \n150 \n151 \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n156 \n157 \n \nTen treatments were imposed on 50m-long plots in a randomised complete block design with six \nblocks. Each block was located around a single field, with three blocks located on sandy clay soils \nand three on clay loam or heavy clay soils. All blocks except one were bounded by hedgerows (the \nexception was bordered by a track), and the boundary type within each block was the same for all \ntreatment plots. All the experimental fields had a long history of intensive arable use and, in the years \nprior to establishing the experiment, had been under continuous cereal production. From 1988 \nonwards they were returned to a rotation, usually with two years of winter wheat, one of winter \nbarley, and the fourth with a break crop of rape, maize or winter beans. \n \nEight of the treatments formed a 2x4 factorial structure: four were sown with a mixture of wild \ngrasses and forbs and four were allowed to regenerate naturally. They then received one of four \ncutting regimes: uncut, or cut (with cuttings removed) in (a) summer only (b) spring and summer or \n(c) spring and autumn. Cutting height was c.4-5cm. The plots were first cut in June 1988 and in \nsubsequent years in the last weeks of April, June and September ('spring', 'summer' and 'autumn' \nrespectively). The new margins were rotavated in March 1988 just before the seed mixture was \nsown. This contained six 'non-aggressive' species of grass and 17 forbs, in a 4:1 ratio, and was sown \nat 30 kg\/ha (Smith et al. 1993; Supplementary Material Table S1). All sown species were perennial \nexcept for Torilis japonica, Silene latifolia ssp. alba (which can be annual, biennial or perennial), and \nTragopogon pratensis which is biennial. The remaining two treatments, imposed on naturally \nregenerating plots, comprised (a) cutting in spring and summer but leaving cut hay in situ, and (b) \nspraying with glyphosate (Roundup, Monsanto Co.; 1.08 kg (a.e.) ha-1 (3 l ha-1 product) at a volume \nrate of 175 l ha-1) in late June each year. \n  \n 6\n158 \n159 \n160 \n161 \n162 \n163 \n164 \n165 \n166 \n167 \n168 \n169 \n170 \n171 \n172 \n173 \n175 \n176 \n177 \n178 \n179 \n180 \n181 \n182 \n183 \nThe plant species on the margins were monitored at least three times a year until 1990, and again in \nlate July 2000, in three 50x100cm permanent quadrats, situated with their long-axes parallel with the \nfield margin at 15, 25 and 35m along each 50m plot. Relative frequencies were estimated by \nrecording presence\/absence of all species rooted within each of eight 25x25cm cells within each \nquadrat. The frequencies of some key weed species were also monitored in 1991, 1992 or 1993.  \nSpecies richness is expressed as the mean number of species recorded per quadrat on each plot. \n  \nData for different sampling occasions were initially analysed by 2-way analysis of variance \n(ANOVA) (blocks x treatments) following appropriate transformation to achieve homogeneity of \nvariance (SAS, 2004). Planned comparisons were used to test for the effects of hay removal (both cut \nin spring and summer) and herbicide application. A further three-way ANOVA was performed on the \neight treatments that formed a 2x4 factorial structure, allowing the treatment effect to be split into \nmain affects of sowing and cutting. We used three sets of planned comparisons to test between: (1) \nplots that were cut and those left uncut, (2) those cut once and those cut twice and (3) those cut in \nspring and summer and those cut in spring and autumn.  \n \n3. Results 174 \n 3.1 Species Richness  \n3.1.1 Temporal trends \nSpecies richness declined over a thirteen-year period. The most rapid decline was after one year, \nbetween 1988 and 1989, and under all treatments numbers of species had approximately halved \nby 2000 (Table 1). Most of the rapid initial decline in species richness was attributable to loss of \nannuals from the closing swards (Fig. 1). Eighty-seven annual species were recorded on the 50m \nfield margin plots, almost all of which were arable weeds originating either from the seedbank or \ncrop (Smith et al. 1993).  \n \n 7\n184 \n185 \n186 \n187 \n188 \n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \n193 \n194 \n195 \n196 \n197 \n198 \n199 \n200 \n201 \n202 \n203 \n204 \n205 \n206 \n207 \n208 \n209 \n210 \n \n3.1.2 The effects of sowing \nAnnuals were excluded most rapidly from sown plots, where the numbers of species were \nsignificantly lower than in naturally regenerated plots within a year of sowing (Fig.1, \nSupplementary Material Table S2). By 2000 there were so few annual species in all treatments \nthat the effect of sowing on their numbers could no longer be detected. \n \nNumbers of perennial species initially increased in naturally regenerated plots and then apparently \nremained stable for the following ten years (Fig. 1). By contrast, in sown plots, they declined \nthroughout the experiment; this decline was most rapid amongst naturally colonising, rather than \nthe sown, species in the early stages of the experiment. Sown species increased to around 70% of \nthe total species complement of sown swards during this period before declining over the next ten \nyears (Fig. 2). After the initial decline, numbers of naturally colonising species in sown swards \nremained relatively constant, so that, by 2000, they slightly exceeded those of sown species, \naveraged over all cutting treatments. \n \nDespite the decline, sown plots remained richer in perennial species than naturally regenerated \nplots throughout the 13-year experiment (Fig. 1).  Sown plots accommodated significantly fewer \nunsown species than were found in naturally regenerated plots (Supplementary Material Table \nS2).   \n \nVery few sown species colonised unsown plots, increasing to an average of just under one per \nquadrat after 13 years.   \n \n3.1.3 The effects of mowing  \nMowing (i.e. mown versus unmown) had less impact than sowing (i.e. sown versus natural \nregeneration) on overall species richness. After 13 years there was no significant main effect of \n 8\n211 \n212 \n213 \n214 \n215 \n216 \n217 \n218 \n219 \n220 \n221 \n222 \n223 \n224 \n225 \n226 \n227 \n228 \n229 \n230 \n231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \nmowing on overall species richness and there were no significant interactions between mowing \nand sowing.  In the establishment years, however, mowing had a significant influence on the \ndevelopment of species richness, with the uncut, naturally regenerated plots being consistently \nmore species-poor than mown plots (Table 1). Plots cut in spring and autumn were consistently \nthe most species rich at that stage, and had significantly more species (both annuals and \nperennials) than those cut in spring and summer on two sampling dates (November 1988 and June \n1989).  \n \nAlthough the mowing regime had no significant effect on overall species richness by 2000, it had \na significant influence on the establishment and persistence of sown species in the sown plots. \nPlots cut twice retained a higher proportion of sown species than those cut once or not at all (Fig. \n2). Numbers of sown species were significantly higher in the former after two years and remained \nso eleven years later (see Supplementary Material Table S3). At this stage, sown plots that were \nleft uncut also had significantly fewer sown species than cut plots. This contrast was also \nsignificant when applied to all species, both sown and unsown, in the sown plots (F(1,35)=10.29, \nP=0.0021). \n \nPlots in which cut hay was left lying were species-poor throughout the experiment although \nnumbers of species were not significantly lower than in other naturally-regenerated plots, \nincluding those cut at the same time, but from which the hay was removed (Table 1). \n \n3.1.4 The effects of spraying \nOn sprayed plots species richness was lower than under all other treatments on most sampling \noccasions (Table 1), although this effect was never significant. Annuals continued to form a \nconspicuous element in the sward and were more numerous than in all other treatments \nthroughout the experiment (Fig. 1, Supplementary Material Table S4). Conversely, numbers of \n 9\n237 \n238 \n239 \n240 \n241 \n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n248 \n249 \n250 \n251 \n252 \n253 \n254 \n255 \n256 \n257 \n258 \n259 \n260 \n261 \n262 \nperennial species on sprayed plots were significantly lower than under all other treatments on all \nsampling occasions from September 1989 onwards (Fig. 1, Supplementary Material Table S4).  \n \n3.2 Sward composition \n3.2.1 Temporal trends \nThe changes in species richness of different components of the sward (above) reflected major \nchanges in the relative abundance of many species. Most annual species had declined to very low \nfrequencies by 2000, although they differed in the year in which their numbers peaked \n(Supplementary Material Figure S1). The most abundant annual (occasionally biennial: Tutin \n1980) in 2000, Bromus hordeaceus (nomenclature follows Stace 1991), exceptionally, increased \nover this period but only to a frequency of ca 10%. The rank order of abundance of the dominant \nannuals changed substantially over the course of the experiment with many of the species that \nwere most prominent in the establishment phase disappearing almost completely from the swards \nwithin a few years. Alopecurus myosuroides and the Avena species (predominantly Avena \nsterilis), for example, peaked and declined much more rapidly than Anisantha sterilis. Conversely, \nGeranium dissectum, the third commonest annual remaining in the swards in 2000, was only the \ntwenty-second most frequent in 1988. \n  \nThere were also major changes in the abundance of many perennial species, most of which were \nlikely to have colonised from the hedge bottom or seedbank (Smith et al. 1993). Of the \ncommonest species, Convolvulus arvensis, Arrhenatherum elatius, Dactylis glomerata and Holcus \nlanatus all increased while Cirsium arvense, Urtica dioica and Elymus repens declined in the \nexperiment as a whole between 1990 and 2000 (Fig. 3).  \n \n3.2.2 The effects of management  \n \n 10\n263 \n264 \n265 \n266 \n267 \n268 \n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \n273 \n274 \n275 \n276 \n277 \n278 \n279 \n280 \n281 \n282 \n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \n287 \n288 \n289 \nThese changes in the abundance of individual species over the experiment as a whole \n(Supplementary Material Figure 1, and Fig. 3) masked often highly significant differences \nbetween treatments. Although the contrasting mowing regimes had relatively little effect on \nspecies richness (above), they had profound effects on the species composition of the swards \n(Table 2).  \n \n \n3.2.3 Annual species  \n \nSowing initially substantially reduced the relative frequency of common annual species.  When \nannuals were most abundant sowing had highly significant effects on individual species but, by \n2000, most were too infrequent for this effect to be detectable. Annuals both peaked at a lower \nfrequency, and declined more rapidly, in sown than in naturally regenerated plots (e.g. Fig. 4).  \n \nThe mowing regimes also influenced the abundance of annuals (data not shown) although their \neffects were generally smaller than that of sowing. For example, by 2000, B. hordeaceus was \nsignificantly less frequent in plots cut twice than in those cut once (F(1,45)=8.16, P<0.01) or left \nuncut. A. sterilis was virtually eliminated from these plots (cut twice v once: F(1,45)=21.45, \nP<0.001) although, in the establishment years, it was significantly more abundant in plots cut in \nspring and autumn than in those cut in spring and summer (in 1989, 1990 and 1992, P<0.05, 0.01 \nand 0.001 respectively). By contrast, Avena species remained significantly more abundant in plots \ncut in spring and autumn from 1989 onwards (P<0.001 in 1989 and 1990) and were restricted to \nthese plots by 2000. \n \nWhere cut hay was left in situ, A. myosuroides, alone amongst the annuals, remained more \nabundant than under other treatments. In 1989 and 1990, when it was still sufficiently abundant \nfor analysis, it was more frequent in these plots than equivalent plots with hay removed (F=4.13 \n 11\nand 4.49, P<0.05). On sprayed plots many annual species remained at relatively high frequencies. \nFor example, in 2000 the mean frequencies of A. sterilis and B. hordeaceus were ca 32% and 55% \nin these plots, compared with ranges between zero and 10% respectively, under other treatments \n(cf Fig. 4). \n290 \n291 \n292 \n293 \n294 \n295 \n296 \n297 \n298 \n299 \n300 \n301 \n302 \n303 \n304 \n305 \n306 \n307 \n308 \n309 \n310 \n311 \n312 \n313 \n314 \n315 \n316 \n \n3.2.4 Unsown perennial species \nSowing very effectively reduced the rate of colonisation by perennials during the establishment \nyears of the experiment (Table 3) but, after 13 years, many common perennial species had \nbecome as abundant in sown as in naturally regenerated swards (Table 4). Notable exceptions \nwere Convolvulus arvensis, which occurred at similar frequencies even in the establishment years, \nand P. trivialis and D. glomerata, which still occurred at significantly lower frequencies in sown \nthan in naturally regenerating swards by 2000 (Table 3).  \n \nMowing had relatively little impact on the frequency of common perennials during the early years \nbut, after 13 years, it significantly influenced the abundance of most of these species. The \nfrequency of mowing was more important than its timing: we found no significant differences \nbetween plots cut in spring and summer and those cut in spring and autumn for any of the \ncommon perennials in 2000.  \n \nAmong the common species D. glomerata, C. arvensis and H. lanatus were all significantly more \nfrequent in mown plots (Fig. 5), with the latter two species also significantly more abundant in \nplots cut twice than in those cut once (see Supplementary Material Table S5). \n \nSimilarly, amongst species that responded negatively to mowing, some were reduced by any \nmowing and others responded by degree to the numbers of cuts. A. elatius was 40% less frequent \nin plots mown twice than in those cut once or not at all (Fig. 5) while C. arvense, U. dioica and E. \nrepens were not only more abundant in uncut than in cut plots but were their abundance was also \n 12\n317 \n318 \n319 \n320 \n321 \n322 \n323 \n324 \n325 \n326 \n327 \n328 \n329 \n330 \n331 \n332 \n333 \n334 \n335 \n336 \n337 \n338 \n339 \n340 \n341 \n342 \nfurther reduced by cutting twice (Fig. 5, Supplementary Material Table S5). Amongst the \ncommonest perennials, only P. trivialis showed no significant response to mowing. \n \nNot removing cut hay substantially increased the abundance of U. dioica but did not appear to \naffect any other common perennial species. By 1990, despite a very significant negative response \nto an increasing frequency of mowing (above), U. dioica, was more abundant in plots that were \ncut twice a year and in which the hay was left in situ than under any other treatment (F(1,45)=4.14, \nP<0.05). By 2000 its frequency in these plots was 27.4%, compared with 1.05% in equivalent \nplots from which the hay was removed (F(1,45)=5.69, P<0.05). \n \nSpraying annually with glyphosate reduced the frequencies of some common perennials to very \nlow levels in 2000, although the frequencies of A. elatius, P. trivialis, C. arvense and U. dioica \nwere not significantly affected (Table 5).  \n \n3.2.5 Sown species  \n \nAll sown species declined in frequency in the sown plots, many of them very substantially, \nbetween 1990 and 2000 (most abundant species shown in Fig. 6).  \n \nIn contrast to some of the unsown perennials, none of the commoner sown perennial grasses was \nsignificantly more abundant in the absence of mowing, at any stage. Trisetum flavescens, P. \npratensis and C. cristatus, were significantly more frequent in cut than in uncut plots from 1989 \nonwards. By 2000 this difference remained significant for T. flavescens (Supplementary Material \nTable S5) while C. cristatus had been lost from uncut plots. By contrast, Phleum bertolonii was, \nmost frequent in plots that were left uncut in summer (either cut in spring and autumn or uncut: \nsee Supplementary Material Table S5). Small changes in abundance of common and uniformly \n 13\ndistributed grasses such as Festuca rubra and Hordeum secalinum, were unlikely to be detected \nby our monitoring method.  \n343 \n344 \n345 \n346 \n347 \n348 \n349 \n350 \n351 \n352 \n353 \n354 \n355 \n356 \n357 \n359 \n361 \n362 \n363 \n364 \n365 \n366 \n367 \n368 \n \nLow frequencies of many of the sown species made it difficult to detect significant effects, but \nmost sown forbs that were sufficiently numerous for analysis in 2000 also responded positively to \nmowing. Leucanthemum vulgare was significantly more abundant in cut than in uncut plots \n(F(1,15)=5.53,  P=0.025).  Knautia arvensis was completely lost from uncut plots. Centuarea nigra \nresponded by degree to the frequency of cutting: it was least abundant in uncut plots but also \nsignificantly less abundant in plots cut once than in those cut twice (F(1,15)= 7.82, P=0.014). \nTorilis japonica, the only consistently annual species included in the seed mixture, was, like P. \nbertolonii, most frequent in plots that were left uncut in summer from 1989 until 2000 (1989 \nF(1,15)=8.34, P=0.011; 1990 F(1,15)=16.77, P=0.001;  1992 F(1,15)=10.01, P=0.006), although this \neffect was no longer significant in 2000.  \n \n \n4. Discussion 358 \n \n4.1 Long term vegetation change 360 \n \nVegetation is subject to year-to-year fluctuations in composition, resulting from, for example, \ninterspecific differences in responses to changing weather conditions and successional processes.  \nAlthough we were only able to monitor the longer-term consequences of succession and \nmanagement on the Wytham field margins once, other monitoring work on the site under the \nEnvironmental Change Network programme (Morecroft et al., 2009) explicitly investigated \ninterannual changes in vegetation during this period.  This investigation included plots in formerly \narable grasslands close to the experimental margins.  This and other work (Morecroft et al., 2002 \n 14\n369 \n370 \n371 \n372 \n373 \n374 \n375 \n376 \n377 \n378 \n379 \n380 \n381 \n382 \n383 \n384 \n385 \n386 \n387 \n388 \n389 \n390 \n391 \n392 \n393 \n394 \n395 \nMorecroft et al., 2004) indicated that the main year-to-year differences are in the proportion of \nannual species within swards, with an increase in annuals following drought, as a result of \ndecreasing grass cover.  This was not, however, of such an extent as to change the overall \ncharacter of the communities.  The period 1999-2000 was relatively wet (Morecroft et al., 2004) \nand it is possible that more annual weed species would have been found following a drier period.  \nHowever the main differences between treatments are not likely to be substantially affected by \nthis and longer lived species are relatively consistent from year to year. \n \n4.2 Weed control \n \nOur results show that when new field margins are established, annual weeds are a short-lived \nproblem, even in the absence of management. In unmanaged, naturally regenerating swards, both \nthe numbers of annual species, and the frequencies of pernicious annuals, declined to low levels \nwithin three years of establishment. This is consistent with other studies of colonisation of former \narable land (e.g. Gibson and Brown, 1992; Steffan-Dewenter and Tscharntke, 1997) although \nmany factors, including soil type, nutrient levels, and the supply of propagules, influence the \ncomposition of the colonising flora and length of time taken to produce perennial-dominated \nswards (Donath et al., 2007; Leng et al., 2009). Within the Wytham experiment, the experimental \nblocks, based around different fields, contributed significantly to the variance in most analyses. \n \nExclusion of annuals was achieved more rapidly by sowing a wildflower seed mixture than by any \nof our mowing regimes: the mat-forming habit, particularly of sown grasses such as F. rubra, \nresulted in rapid sward closure. Numbers of annual species and the frequencies of individual \nspecies were reduced faster, and peak frequencies were lower, in sown swards irrespective of the \nmowing regime. Schippers and Joenje (2002) similarly found that all annuals in an \nannual\/perennial mixture sown on an old arable field were lost after two years where management \nensured the development of closed perennial swards. \n 15\n396 \n397 \n398 \n399 \n400 \n401 \n402 \n403 \n404 \n405 \n406 \n407 \n408 \n409 \n410 \n411 \n412 \n413 \n414 \n415 \n416 \n417 \n418 \n419 \n420 \n421 \n422 \n \nThe timing and frequency of mowing could also be used to manipulate the rate of loss of annual \nspecies in the establishment phase by influencing seed return and establishment opportunities. \nThus, A. sterilis and B. hordeaceus decreased more rapidly as the frequency of mowing increased: \nboth of these species lack seed dormancy and are dependent on seed dispersal for population \nmaintenance or increase. Avena species, despite exhibiting seed dormancy, decreased least rapidly \nwhen cut in spring and autumn: summer cutting removed its seeds before they matured, \nsuggesting that seed set and dispersal was also important. A. myosuroides was most persistent \nwhere hay cut in late June, containing ripe seed, was left lying.  Thus, where it is felt necessary to \nincrease the rate of annual weed loss, the management regime can clearly be targeted at the \ndominant species (Watt et al., 1990).  \n \nOur results show that any application of broad spectrum herbicide that opens up gaps on field \nmargins can allow annuals to persist while yielding an overall reduction in species richness and \nparticularly in numbers of perennials. Some perennial weeds were effectively controlled, but other \nspecies, including A. elatius, P. trivialis and U. dioica showed little response. Herbicides \nrecommended specifically for controlling broad-leaved weeds in grass field margins (Boatman, \n1989) would be expected to be effective in excluding annual grasses by allowing a dense grass \nsward to develop. However, they also exclude the broadleaved species that have a \ndisproportionate influence on invertebrate and avian diversity by providing nectar sources (Meek \net al., 2002; Pywell et al., 2005), structural heterogeneity (Baines et al., 1998; Asteraki et al., \n2004) and seeds (Wilson et al., 1999; Vickery et al., 2002). Equally, there is little evidence to \nshow that the use of graminicides to encourage broadleaved species on field margins results in \nfield margin swards dominated by desirable perennial species (Marshall and Novakowski, 1994; \nWestbury et al. 2008). This experiment shows that swards that are species rich, attractive, and \nrelatively weed-free, can be achieved by sowing and by simple mowing regimes that take account \nof the phenologies and life histories of the target species. \n 16\n423 \n424 \n425 \n426 \n427 \n428 \n429 \n430 \n431 \n432 \n433 \n434 \n435 \n436 \n437 \n438 \n439 \n440 \n441 \n442 \n443 \n444 \n445 \n446 \n447 \n448 \n449 \n \nWhilst annual weeds are a short-lived problem in closing perennial swards, pernicious perennial \nweeds, with high potential growth rates, might be expected to be more intractable on the enriched \nsoils of arable field margins. In the establishment years, species such as C. arvense, U. dioica and \nE. repens increased progressively in naturally regenerated plots.  By 2000, however, these species \nhad declined over the experiment as a whole, responding negatively, often by degree, to the \nfrequency of mowing. Consistent cutting, only twice a year, over this period can clearly give good \ncontrol of species such as C. arvense, often assumed to require control by herbicide in high-\nfertility situations.  \n \nSowing initially appeared to be more effective than mowing in controlling perennial weeds. Sown \nswards largely excluded rhizomatous perennials for at least three years. Marshall (1990) also \nshowed that E. repens was excluded from perennial grass swards over a three year period. \nSimilarly, De Cauwer et al. (2008) found that three years after field margins were established, E. \nrepens and U. dioica were significantly more frequent in unsown compared to sown swards. \nHowever, we showed here that the beneficial effect of sowing was relatively short-term and that \nrhizomatous, weedy perennial species could increase progressively at the expense of less \ncompetitive sown grasses. \n \n4. Species richness  \n \nEstablishing sown swards on field margins has been heavily promoted in agri-environment \nschemes, originally because of their attractive and tidy appearance and benefits for weed control \nand, increasingly, to benefit farmland biodiversity, one of the primary objectives of \nEnvironmental Stewardship in the UK  (Critchley et al., 2006; Marshall et al., 2006). However, \nseveral studies have found that species richness starts to decrease after the first year (e.g.  \nMarshall and Nowakowski, 1995; West and Marshall, 1996; De Cauwer et al., 2005), while that \n 17\n450 \n451 \n452 \n453 \n454 \n455 \n456 \n457 \n458 \n459 \n460 \n461 \n462 \n463 \n464 \n465 \n466 \n467 \n468 \n469 \n470 \n471 \n472 \n473 \n474 \n475 \n476 \nof comparable naturally regenerating swards increases and stabilises. De Cauwer et al. (2005) \nfound significant convergence in species richness and vegetation composition between sown and \nunsown plots after only three years and Warren et al. (2002) after six years.  In contrast, Carvell et \nal. (2007) found that, after three years, field margin swards sown with a diverse wildflower \nmixture remained substantially different from naturally regenerated ones and provided better \nquality habitat for bumblebees, although a more species poor mixture proved less stable.  There is \ntherefore a degree of uncertainty about the effectiveness of sowing as a tool for enhancing \nbiodiversity in the medium to long term, particularly if a species-poor mixture is used.  \n \nOur results suggest that loss of species richness in sown swards is a more long-term process. \nSpecies richness declined in sown plots during establishment but this resulted from loss of \nunsown colonists rather than sown species. Numbers of natural colonists then stabilised over the \nnext ten years but the increasing abundance of rhizomatous perennial species with high potential \ngrowth rates, probably accounts for a slow but progressive decline in numbers of sown species. \nNevertheless, even after 13 years, sown species still comprised up to 53% of the total in sown \nswards, and many unsown perennials remained significantly less common in sown than in \nnaturally regenerated swards, consistent with recent demonstrations that resistance to invasion \nincreases with sward diversity (e.g. Fargione et al., 2003; Mwangi et al., 2007). They suggest that \ninvasion resistance increases with niche pre-emption and is stronger within than between \nfunctional groups of species. This could explain the much more rapid invasion of the grass-\ndominated, sown swards by Convolvulus arvensis than by Elytrigia repens, for example.  \n \nThe sown swards were more similar in appearance, structure and species composition to local \nsemi-natural grasslands. Festuca species included in the sown mixture formed a very dense sward \nbase and persisted at high frequency even after thirteen years. Similarly, Schippers and Joenje \n(2002) showed that Festuca was maintained on field margins when nitrate levels were low, or \nwhere there was a gradient in fertility levels.  The retention of sown forbs in the sown swards \n 18\n477 \n478 \n479 \n480 \n481 \n482 \n483 \n484 \n485 \n486 \n487 \n488 \n489 \n490 \n491 \n492 \n493 \n494 \n495 \n496 \n497 \n498 \n499 \n500 \n501 \n502 \n503 \nprobably improved their quality for many invertebrates compared to naturally regenerated swards. \nThree years after sowing, they had significantly greater abundance and species richness of \nAraneae (Baines et al., 1998) and higher abundance of butterflies (Feber et al., 1996), and \nAuchenorrhyncha (Smith et al., 1993). Haenke et al. (2009) similarly report higher densities of \nSyrphids in sown than in naturally regenerated field margin strips. \n \nSeveral studies have found that the rate of loss of sown species in the establishment phase of new \nfield margins can be manipulated by the mowing regime (Schippers and Joenje, 2002; De Cauwer \net al., 2005). At Wytham, any mowing in the establishment phase increased the number of \nperennial species, while mowing in spring and autumn produced the richest swards. This regime \nalso delayed the decline in annuals and appears to have been effective by increasing opportunities \nfor seed return and germination over the winter.  \n \nAfter thirteen years, the timing of mowing was no longer important, but its frequency continued to \ninfluence species retention in sown swards. The better retention of sown species in mown plots \nmay result from the selection of more stress tolerant species compared to competitors (sensu \nGrime et al., 1988). Westbury et al. (2008) found that disturbance of sown swards by annual \nscarification could result in higher retention of unsown colonists than in mown swards (with hay \nleft in situ) in the first four years after sowing. Unsown species retention on the sown Wytham \nfield margins may have been limited by lack of disturbance, although the beneficiaries of \nscarification were ruderals and competitive perennial colonists, including pernicious weeds. \nAlthough 2m-wide margins are still included as an option in current agri-environment schemes, \nwider margins of 4m or 6m are commonly established. These may provide opportunities for more \nflexible management, including greater disturbance. However, there is little evidence from other \nstudies that, over the short term at least, an increase in margin width results in greater species \nrichness (e.g. Sheridan et al., 2008). One might predict the establishment phase to be more \nprotracted as distance from the boundary and sources of many perennials increases, and a \n 19\n504 \n505 \n506 \n507 \n508 \n509 \n510 \n511 \n512 \n513 \n514 \n515 \n516 \n517 \n518 \n519 \n520 \n521 \n522 \n523 \n524 \n525 \n526 \n527 \n528 \n529 \n530 \nbuffering effect of wider margins may become more apparent over the longer term, but further \nwork is required to elucidate this. \n \nField margins left to colonise naturally remained significantly less species rich than sown margins \neven after 13 years, despite perennial species increasing in the establishment phase, and \nstabilising thereafter. Most species of all types colonised in the first two years of the experiment. \nOnce closed swards had developed, very few new species appeared (Smith et al., 1994). The \nsubstantial failure of most sown species to colonise adjacent unsown plots after 13 years \nillustrates the effectiveness of this competitive exclusion. Although, as on sown plots, species \nrichness in the naturally regenerating swards could be manipulated by mowing in the \nestablishment years, mowing was ineffective for manipulating diversity in the longer term. \nMowing sown plots altered the rate of species loss: on naturally regenerated plots few species \nwere lost and the effects of mowing could only be detected in changes in relative abundance.  \n \nEven the removal of cut hay \u2013 a mantra of conservation management because of its expected \neffect in reducing soil nutrient levels and increasing sward diversity (Marrs, 1993; Jacquemyn et \nal., 2003) - did not significantly affect the species richness of naturally regenerated plots on the \ntimescale of our experiment, although plots in which hay was left lying were always relatively \nspecies poor. This is consistent with the suggestion that lack of a diversity response to nutrient \nchange on fertile soils is because mid-successional species tend to be competitively equivalent: \nthe initial response to changing nutrient level is likely to be through gradual changes in relative \nabundance that translates only slowly into changes in species richness (Huston, 1994; Huberty et \nal., 1998). On sown field margins De Cauwer et al. (2005) recorded a much more rapid impact of \nleaving hay lying. After only three years, significantly more sown species were retained where \nhay, cut twice a year, was removed, rather than left lying. The increase that we recorded in U. \ndioica where hay was left lying suggests that nutrient demanding species (Marrs, 1993; Hogg et \nal., 1995) are likely to thrive at the expense of the slower growing species commonly used in seed \n 20\n531 \n532 \n533 \n534 \n535 \n536 \n537 \n538 \n539 \n540 \n541 \n542 \n543 \n544 \n545 \n547 \n548 \n549 \n550 \n551 \n552 \n553 \n554 \n555 \n556 \n557 \nmixtures, and result in more rapid loss of species richness than on naturally regenerated swards. \nLeaving cut vegetation lying may also have a smothering affect sufficient to affect germination \nand\/or survival of seedlings, especially those that require light to germinate. \n \nFew common perennials were significantly affected by mowing during the establishment phase, \nbut after 13 years the most competitive species (sensu Grime et al., 1988) were more abundant in \nthe absence of mowing, while most of the sown species, typical of semi-natural grassland, fared \nbetter, often by degree, when mown. In established swards, the frequency of mowing had more \ninfluence than its timing on the abundance of perennial species that remained common. The \ntiming of mowing might be expected to have less influence on species that propagate by seed, \nonce sward closure restricted germination opportunities. It would, however, be expected to \ncontinue to have a substantial influence on other taxa, including granivorous birds (Vickery et al., \n2009), small mammals (Shore et al., 2005) and nectar-feeding invertebrates (Marshall et al., 2006; \nPywell et al., 2006). \n \n5. Conclusions 546 \n \nThe results of this experiment show that short-term experiments on arable field margin \nestablishment are unlikely to provide an accurate insight into the longer term outcomes either for \nperennial weed control or the development of biodiversity, although they do give an important \ninsight into early successional processes. In particular, we found that different mowing regimes \nenhanced plant species richness in the establishment years and in the longer-term, with the \nfrequency of mowing becoming more important than its timing. The increase in perennial species \nwith high potential growth rates during the establishment phase was not maintained and was \nreduced by mowing. Swards established by sowing a wild flower seed mixture effectively \nexcluded perennial as well as annual weeds in the establishment years but not in the longer term. \nBut despite losses of sown species from these swards they remained more species rich than \n 21\nnaturally regenerated swards for at least thirteen years.  They also contained a higher proportion \nof species typical of semi-natural grassland rather than of disturbed ground.  \n558 \n559 \n560 \n561 \n562 \n563 \n564 \n565 \n566 \n567 \n568 \n569 \n570 \n571 \n572 \n573 \n574 \n575 \n576 \n577 \n578 \n579 \n580 \n581 \n582 \n583 \n584 \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nWe are grateful to Drs Jon Marshall and Richard Pywell and two anonymous referees for helpful \ncomments on this manuscript, to the many people who helped maintain the experiment, and to the \nUniversity of Oxford Farm for accommodating it.
