We explain why their criticism is unfounded.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevE.77.028201 PACS number\u0001s\u0002: 05.45.\u0001a\nRecently a paper appeared \u00031\u0004 in which the 0-1 test for\nchaos \u00032,3\u0004 was investigated with respect to its reliability.\nThe authors accepted the reliability for distinguishing be-\ntween regular and fully developed chaos. However, their\nconclusions were largely negative. In this Comment we re-\nfute the criticism on the reliability.\nWe first recall the 0-1 test, following \u00033\u0004 where we gave a\nmodified and simplified version of the original test \u00032\u0004; the\nmodified test deals better with noisy data. Consider a scalar\nobservable \u0002\u0001n\u0002. In an experiment, \u0002\u0001n\u0002 is a discrete set of\nmeasurement data. Choose c\u00030 and define\np\u0001n\u0002 =\u0005\nj=1\nn\n\u0002\u0001j\u0002cos jc , \u00011\u0002\nfor n=1,2 , . . . Define the mean square displacement\nM\u0001n\u0002 = lim\nN\u2192\u0004\n1\nN\u0005j=1\nN\n\u0003p\u0001j + n\u0002 \u2212 p\u0001j\u0002\u00042\nand the asymptotic growth rate\nK = lim\nn\u2192\u0004\nln M\u0001n\u0002\/ln n .\nIf the underlying dynamics is regular \u0001i.e., periodic or quasi-\nperiodic\u0002 then K=0; if the underlying dynamics is chaotic\nthen K=1. \u0001We refer to \u00032,3\u0004 for the justification of these\nstatements.\u0002\nIn practice, let N denote the amount of data. Throughout\nthis Comment, we compute M\u0001n\u0002 for N \/100\u0005n\u0005N \/10 to\nensure that 0\u0002n\u0002N. Then we compute K by performing a\nleast square fit for ln M\u0001n\u0002 versus ln n. This is done for 100\nrandomly chosen values of c and the median value of K is\nthe final output of the test \u0001cf. \u00033\u0004\u0002.\nSection II of \u00031\u0004 is devoted to \u201cunderstanding\u201d the test for\nchaos, namely, that the test examines how the variance of the\nauxiliary process p\u0001n\u0002 scales with time. This interpretation is\ncorrect but was already present in the original paper. Indeed,\nthe R-extension discussed in \u0003\u00032\u0004, Sec. 5\u0004 corresponds ex-\nactly to the fluctuation analysis in \u00031\u0004. As mentioned explic-\nitly in \u0003\u00032\u0004, Sec. 5\u0004, the necessity to subtract off the mean is\na nontrivial obstruction, whereas a crucial property of the 0-1\ntest \u0003which is an SE\u00012\u0002-extension\u0004 is that the mean automati-\ncally vanishes \u0001due to rotation symmetry in the plane\u0002. A\ndeeper understanding of the 0-1 test would recognize the\nissue with the mean which underlies the development of the\ntest in \u00032\u0004.\nThe mathematics behind the test establishes a dichotomy\nfor deterministic systems: bounded or diffusive behavior of\nthe mean zero random walk. This is one of the strengths of\nthe test, a binary diagnostic 0 or 1, with no gray areas in\nprinciple. \u0001There are always gray areas in practice for any\ntest.\u0002 Hence Sec. III of \u00031\u0004, which highlights the misclassifi-\ncation of 1 \/ f\u0006 noise \u0001it is shown that the 0-1 test yields K\n=1 independent of the choice of \u0006\u0002 has missed the point.\nMoreover, it is a misapplication of the test; as clearly stated\nin both our manuscripts \u00032,3\u0004 the test is designed for deter-\nministic \u0001but possible noisy\u0002 systems. \u0001Indeed, the paper \u00032\u0004\nis entitled A New Test for Chaos in Deterministic Systems.\u0002\nThe problem of distinguishing between chaotic and stochas-\ntic dynamics\u2014although of obvious practical importance\u2014is\ndifferent from the problem we are working on and hence is\nnot grounds for criticism.\nSection IV of \u00031\u0004 discusses the \u201cedge of chaos\u201d and \u201cweak\nchaos\u201d in the context of the logistic map xn+1=axn\u00011\u2212xn\u0002\n+\u0007\bn, where a is the bifurcation parameter and \bn\n*gottwald@maths.usyd.edu.au\n\u2020ism@math.uh.edu\n-0.02\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0 20000 40000\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n0 30000\n-0.005\n0\n0.005\n0 30000\nK\nN\nKK\nNN\nFIG. 1. \u0001Color online\u0002 Plot of K as a function of N for the\nlogistic map at a=a\u0004 \u0001dark gray line, red online\u0002 and a=a\u0004\n+0.001 \u0001light gray line, green online\u0002.

It is claimed that the 0-1 test cannot distinguish\nproperly the edge of chaos at a=a\u0004=3.569 945 672. . . and\nweak chaos at a=a\u0004+0.001. We refute this claim below on\nthree different levels: \u0001i\u0002 For the parameters considered in \u00031\u0004\na visual version of our test is effective; \u0001ii\u0002 for most practical\npurposes the automated test is effective with a moderate\namount of data; and \u0001iii\u0002 in theory the automated test works\nwith probability one. For brevity, we restrict to clean data\n\u0007=0 \u0001see \u00033\u0004 for noisy data\u0002.\nStarting with \u0001i\u0002, for the specific parameters a\u0004 and a\u0004\n+0.001 we computed K versus N up to N=50 000. The re-\nsults are shown in Fig. 1 and show a clear functional differ-\nence of K\u0001N\u0002. Also defining p\u0001n\u0002 as in Eq. \u00011\u0002 and q\u0001n\u0002\n=\u0005 j=1\nn \u0002\u0001j\u0002sin jc, we plotted p\u0001n\u0002 versus q\u0001n\u0002 in Fig. 2. Here\nN=5000 suffices for an effective visual distinction of the\nregular and the weakly chaotic case. Again this visual test\nwas explicit in the original paper \u0003\u00032\u0004, Sec. 5\u0004. We should\nemphasize that a major advantage of our test over methods\nsuch as \u00031\u0004 is that it is easily automated and in most cases it\nis not necessary to make a visual interpretation of the results.\nFor \u0001ii\u0002, see Fig. 3, where the results of our test are shown\nfor N=5000. The parameter a is incremented in steps of 0.01\nfor 3.5\u0005a\u00054 and it is clear that the automated test \u0001i.e., the\ncomputed value of K\u0002 is effective for most values of a.\nTurning to \u0001iii\u0002, the dynamics of the logistic map is par-\nticularly well understood \u00034\u0004: Almost every value of a yields\neither a periodic attractor or a chaotic attractor satisfying the\nCollet-Eckmann condition. It then follows from results in \u00035\u0004\nand \u00036\u0004, respectively, that with probability one, K converges\nto 0 and 1 as N\u2192\u0004.\nIn conclusion, the claim that the 0-1 test is not reliable is\nunsubstantiated. The authors chose to focus on \u0001a\u0002 situations\nwhere the test was not intended to apply, and \u0001b\u0002 very spe-\ncialized situations in tiny regions of parameter space. In this\nComment we have reiterated the effectiveness of the 0-1 test\noutside these regions and established the efficacy of our test\nin situation \u0001b\u0002. The claims in \u00031\u0004 are thus shown to be based\non misunderstandings regarding the intended scope and\nimplementation of the test.\nWe agree with the final comment of the authors that sci-\nentists should use all available methods to characterize and\nanalyze complex data; for essentially deterministic data the\n0-1 test is such a method. We do not claim that our test will\nreplace traditional methods such as those relying on phase-\nspace reconstruction \u00037,8\u0004 but that it avoids certain well-\ndocumented drawbacks of such tests \u00039\u0004 and hence is likely\nto be advantageous in certain situations.\nG.A.G. is partly supported by ARC Grant No.\nDP0452147.
