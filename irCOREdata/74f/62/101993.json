The Equivariant Branching Lemma is used to predict the\ngeneric bifurcating solution branches corresponding to each irreducible\nrepresentation of the icosahedral group Ih. The relevant amplitude\nequations are deduced from the equivariance condition, and used to\ninvestigate the stability of bifurcating solutions. It is found that the bi-\nfurcation with icosahedral symmetry can lead to competition between\ntwofold, threefold and fivefold symmetric structures, and between so-\nlutions with tetrahedral, threefold and twofold symmetry. Stable het-\n1\neroclinic cycles between solutions with Dz2 symmetry are found to exist\nin one of the irreps. The theoretical scenarios are compared with the\nobserved behaviour of icosahedral viruses and nanoclusters.\n1 Introduction\nSurprisingly, icosahedral symmetry occurs quite frequently in nature.\nMany viruses are icosahedral [1]-[7]. Quasicrystals with icosahedral\npoint symmetry were discovered by Shechtman et al. [8] in splat-\ncooled Al-Mn alloy. Shapes with icosahedral symmetry also emerge\nat the primary steady state bifurcation in systems with O(3) symmetry\n[9]-[12]; this has recently been applied to the growth of tumours [13].\nThe fullerene molecule or \u201cbuckyball\u201d, a carbon molecule consisting of\n60 atoms (C60) arranged in a ball with pentagonal and hexagonal faces\nlike a regular football (soccerball), is a truncated icosahedron. Other\nicosahedral fullerenes made up of larger numbers of carbon atoms also\nexist. Clusters of metal or rare gas atoms in the gas phase may take on\nicosahedral symmetry: depending on the number of atoms in the clus-\nter, they are generally in competition with decahedral or face-centred\ncubic clusters [14]. Such icosahedral nanoclusters may also be found\nin metal atoms growing on surfaces [14] or in the condensed phase\nof (C60) [15], where the clusters consist of groups of (C60) molecules,\nthemselves icosahedral, rather than atoms.\nThe current work seeks to discover the shapes that emerge at the\nprimary stationary bifurcation in systems with icosahedral symmetry,\nsuch as those described above. This will allow us to make predictions\nabout the ways in which icosahedral structures will change shape: for\n2\nexample icosahedral clusters will lose their symmetry on gaining or\nlosing an atom. As clusters form, they seek to minimise their poten-\ntial energy in a dissipative process, and it is reasonable to assume that\nthis evolution can be characterised by an ordinary differential equa-\ntion. It would be natural to expect that the new cluster configuration\nwould have the symmetry of a solution that emerges as a stable branch\nat the primary bifurcation. In fact this is only sometimes the case as\nwe shall see in \u00a75. Similarly it is observed that icosahedral viruses\nundergo configurational changes as part of their function [2]-[7]. If\nthese occur as the result of some kind of stress, physical compression\nor stretching being possible examples, then again one might expect\nsymmetry-breaking to occur in such a way that the new shape con-\nforms to the symmetry of a stable solution branch. At present, how-\never, images of icosahedral viruses are typically produced by averaging\nover many individual images, exploiting the icosahedral symmetry to\nsuperimpose pictures taken of different views of the virus [3] so as to\ncapture high resolution details. Thus if the observed configurational\nchanges are icosahedral modes, as appears often to be the case [2] [4]-\n[7], it is not possible to tell whether this is in fact due to the averaging\nused in reconstructing the images. The current paper suggests that\nstructures with less than full icosahedral symmetry may emerge at\nthe primary bifurcation: it might then be possible to use the reduced\nsymmetries to reconstruct the image and investigate whether viruses\nuse the pathways suggested by bifurcation theory in their biological\nfunction.\nIn the following section we set out the irreducible representations of\nthe icosahedral group Ih. In section 3 we use the Equivariant Branch-\n3\ning Lemma to predict the bifurcating solution branches in each case.\nWe use the equivariance condition to deduce the Ih-equivariant am-\nplitude equations for each irrep and hence we determine the stability\nof solution branches. In section 4 we investigate the existence of het-\neroclinic cycles in the system. The paper concludes with a discussion\nin section 5.\n2 The icosahedral group and its irre-\nducible representations\nThe icosahedral group I is generated by the elements g2 and g3, where\n(g2)\n2 = (g3)\n3 = (g2g3)\n5 = e, illustrated in figure 1. It has order 60,\nand the elements are g\u00b55 g\n\u03c3\n2d, g\n\u00b5\n5 g2g\n\u03bd\n5g\n\u03c3\n2d, for \u00b5, \u03bd = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \u03c3 = 0, 1,\nwhere g2d \u2261 g2g\u221215 g2g5g2g\u221215 , g5 \u2261 g3g2g3, g3 \u2261 g25g2g35g2d [16]. The\nicosahedral group is isomorphic to A5, the alternating group of order\n5. In the case where we wish to include reflections, the group is Ih and\nwe add an additional generator gc, the reflection through the origin\nx \u2192 \u2212x, where (gc)2 = e. We will consider the case with reflections\nin all that follows.\nConsider the stationary bifurcation problem\nx\u02d9 = f(x, \u03bb) (1)\nin a system with icosahedral symmetry. Here x(t) represents the state\nof the system, t is time, the dot denotes the time derivative and \u03bb is a\nbifurcation parameter. The system of equations ( 1) is Ih-equivariant,\nand thus\nf(\u03b3 \u00b7 x, \u03bb) = \u03b3 \u00b7 f(x, \u03bb), \u2200\u03b3 \u2208 Ih. (2)\n4\nIt is assumed that the zero solution x = 0, which has full icosahedral\nsymmetry, is stationary at the bifurcation point \u03bb = 0, i.e. f(0, 0) = 0,\nand that at \u03bb = 0 an isolated real eigenvalue (of multiplicity greater\nthan one, in general) passes transversely through zero. The last as-\nsumption rules out Hamiltonian systems in particular.\nThe symmetry of solution branches bifurcating from x = 0 at\n\u03bb = 0 can be determined from a consideration of the irreducible rep-\nresentations (irreps) and subgroups of Ih. There are ten irreps and the\ncharacter table is given in Table 1. The subgroups of Ih are given in\nTable 2 together with their generators and abstract definitions. The\nlattice of inclusion of these subgroups is shown in figure 2.\nIt is of interest to note that the representations of Ih based on\npermutations of the directed lines joining opposite faces, opposite ver-\ntices and the midpoints of opposite edges are not irreps. For any given\nrepresentation, R, the number of times, nP , that each irrep P appears\nin R can be calculated according to the formula\nnP =\n1\ng\n\u2211\nj\n\u03c7R(gj)\u03c7\n\u2217\nP (gj), (3)\nwhere the gj are the group elements, g is the order of the group, \u03c7R(gj)\nis the character of gj in representation R and \u03c7\n\u2217\nP (gj) is the complex\nconjugate of its character in irrep P [17]. This formula can be used to\ndeduce that the representation which permutes directed lines joining\nopposite vertices contains one copy of each of irreps 2\u2212 and 3\u2212, the one\npermuting directed lines joining the centres of opposite faces contains\none copy of each of irreps 2\u2212, 3\u2212 and 4\u2212, and the one permuting\ndirected lines joining the midpoints of opposite edges contains one\ncopy of each of irreps 2\u2212, 3\u2212, 4\u2212 and 5\u2212.\n5\n3 Bifurcating solution branches and their\nsymmetries\nWe shall assume that the system has been reduced to the evolution\non the centre manifold, where the dynamics is described by the be-\nhaviour of a finite number of modes. A generic steady-state symmetric\nbifurcation is governed by an absolutely irreducible representation of\nthe symmetry group [18], so we shall consider the action on the centre\nmanifold to be described by one of the irreps of Ih. In order to de-\ntermine the symmetry of the bifurcating solution branches we will use\nthe Equivariant Branching Lemma, which can be stated as follows:\nTheorem (The Equivariant Branching Lemma): Let \u0393 be a compact\nLie group acting on Rn, with Fix \u0393 = {0}, and let x\u02d9 = f(x, \u03bb) be a\n\u0393-equivariant smooth bifurcation problem with Df\n\u2223\u2223\n(0,0)\n= 0. Then,\nfor every isotropy subgroup \u03a3 satisfying dim Fix(\u03a3) = 1 there is a\nunique solution branch (x(\u03bb), \u03bb), as long as Df\u03bb\n\u2223\u2223\n(0,0)\n(v0) 6= 0 for non-\nzero v0 \u2208 Fix(\u03a3).\nThis result is stated and proved in [18] pp.83-84.\nAccording to the trace formula ([18] p.76) the axial isotropy sub-\ngroups, i.e. those with dim Fix(\u03a3) = 1, must satisfy\n1\nnG\nnG\u22121\u2211\ni=0\n\u03c7p(gi) = 1, (4)\nwhere the gi are the elements of the isotropy subgroup, \u03c7\np(gi) is the\ncharacter of the element gi under the representation R\np of \u0393, and nG\nis the order of the isotropy subgroup.\nThe trace formula can now be used to identify the symmetry of\nthe solutions guaranteed by the Equivariant Branching Lemma by\n6\ncomputing the lefthand side of equation ( 4) for each isotropy sub-\ngroup under irrep Rp of Ih and finding those for which the calculation\ngives 1. The results are given in Table 3. For the five-dimensional\nirreps the table also includes maximal, but non-axial, isotropy sub-\ngroups that will be discussed below. Illustrations of solutions with\nthe isotropy subgroups given in Table 3 are presented in figures 3- 6.\nIn the case where there are no reflections the isotropy subgroups with\ndim Fix(\u03a3) = 1 are also given in [19]. Irreps 2\u00b1, 3\u00b1 and 5\u00b1 lead\nto competition between structures with twofold, threefold and fivefold\nsymmetry. Irrep 4+ has tetrahedral competing with threefold symme-\ntry, and irrep 4\u2212 leads to tetrahedral\/threefold\/twofold competition.\nAll of these are highly unusual scenarios.\nAmplitude equations\nz\u02d9 = g(z;\u03bb) z \u2208 Rnp, (5)\ngoverning the dynamics on the centre manifold can be found from the\nequivariance condition\nM\u03b3g(z;\u03bb) = g(M\u03b3z;\u03bb), \u2200\u03b3 \u2208 Ih (6)\nwhere np is the dimension of the relevant irrep and M\u03b3 is the matrix\nrepresenting the group element \u03b3 in that irrep. Close to onset of the\nbifurcation the amplitude equations can be expanded in powers of the\nzj , the components of z. The equivariance condition will determine\nwhich of these terms can appear on the righthand side of the ampli-\ntude equations. Those that are permitted appear with an arbitrary\ncoefficient. Certain features of the amplitude equations may only hold\nfor special values of the coefficients: for example, some solutions may\nonly appear if certain combinations of coefficients are zero. Features\n7\nthat hold for general values of the coefficients, in the absence of spe-\ncial constraints, are termed generic. For any particular application the\nvalues of the coefficients can be determined from the form of f(x, \u03bb)\nfor the system in question.\n3.1 One-dimensional irreps\nThe only nontrivial one-dimensional irrep is 1\u2212, which governs solu-\ntions with only the rotational symmetries of an icosahedron. They\narise at a pitchfork bifurcation, since some of the matrices in the ir-\nrep are \u22121 and hence the equivariance condition becomes \u2212g(z;\u03bb) =\ng(\u2212z;\u03bb), forbidding terms even in z. Thus the amplitude equation is\nz\u02d9 = \u03bbz + c3z\n3 + ... (7)\nIt is easy to show that the stationary solutions are given by z2 =\n\u2212\u03bb\/c3, and perturbations to them have growth rate eigenvalue \u22122\u03bb,\nso the solutions will be stable if \u03bb > 0 and unstable otherwise.\n3.2 Three-dimensional irreps\nIn irreps 2\u00b1 the generators of the group can be represented by the\nmatrices\nMg5 =\n1\n2\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n1\/\u03c4 \u2212\u03c4 1\n\u03c4 1 1\/\u03c4\n\u22121 1\/\u03c4 \u03c4\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (8)\nMg2 =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u22121 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 \u22121\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (9)\n8\nwhere \u03c4 = (1 +\n\u221a\n5)\/2. In irreps 3\u00b1 the corresponding matrices are\nMg5 =\n1\n2\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u2212\u03c4 \u22121\/\u03c4 1\n1\/\u03c4 1 \u03c4\n\u22121 \u03c4 \u22121\/\u03c4\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (10)\nMg2 =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u22121 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 \u22121\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 . (11)\nBoth irreps 2+ and 3+ have Mgc = I, while irreps 2\u2212 and 3\u2212 have\nMgc = \u2212I. Irrep 3\u2212 is the natural representation of Ih.\nThe amplitude equations are found from the equivariance condi-\ntion ( 6). In order to distinguish between solutions with twofold,\nthreefold and fivefold symmetry it is necessary to go to fifth order\nin the expansion. The calculations are extremely time-consuming\nand were performed using the computer algebra package Maple, as\nwere the derivations of the amplitude equations for the four- and five-\ndimensional irreps presented below.\nIrreps 2\u00b1 give rise to the amplitude equations\nz\u02d91 = \u03bbz1 \u2212 c1z1(z21 + z22 + z23)\n+\n1\n10\n(5(c2 + c3)\u2212\n\u221a\n5(c2 \u2212 c3))z51 + 2c3z31z22 + 2c2z31z23 + c2z1z42\n+(c2 + c3 \u2212\n\u221a\n5(c2 \u2212 c3))z1z22z23 + c3z1z43 , (12)\nz\u02d92 = \u03bbz2 \u2212 c1z2(z21 + z22 + z23)\n+\n1\n10\n(5(c2 + c3)\u2212\n\u221a\n5(c2 \u2212 c3))z52 + 2c3z32z23 + 2c2z32z21 + c2z2z43\n+(c2 + c3 \u2212\n\u221a\n5(c2 \u2212 c3))z2z23z21 + c3z2z41 , (13)\nz\u02d93 = \u03bbz3 \u2212 c1z3(z21 + z22 + z23)\n+\n1\n10\n(5(c2 + c3)\u2212\n\u221a\n5(c2 \u2212 c3))z53 + 2c3z33z21 + 2c2z33z22 + c2z3z41\n+(c2 + c3 \u2212\n\u221a\n5(c2 \u2212 c3))z3z21z22 + c3z3z42 , (14)\n9\nwhere z = (z1, z2, z3). (Note that these ci are different from those\nappearing in the amplitude equations for the 1\u2212 irrep above.) The\nequations are in gradient form such that z\u02d9 = \u2207V , where\nV =\n1\n2\n\u03bb(z21 + z\n2\n2 + z\n2\n3)\u2212\nc1\n4\n(z41 + z\n4\n2 + z\n4\n3)\n\u2212c1\n2\n(z21z\n2\n2 + z\n2\n2z\n2\n3 + z\n2\n3z\n2\n1)\n+\n1\n60\n(5(c2 + c3)\u2212\n\u221a\n5(c2 \u2212 c3))(z61 + z62 + z63)\n+\nc2\n2\n(z41z\n2\n3 + z\n4\n2z\n2\n1 + z\n4\n3z\n2\n2) +\nc3\n2\n(z41z\n2\n2 + z\n4\n2z\n2\n3 + z\n4\n3z\n2\n1). (15)\nFor irreps 3\u00b1 the equations are identical apart from a change of sign\nin front of the\n\u221a\n5 wherever it appears.\nThe stationary solutions to these equations are given in Table 4\ntogether with the growth rate eigenvalues for perturbations to the\nsolutions. Closed form representations of the eigenvalues in terms\nof \u03bb and the ci are hard to obtain, but close to onset where \u03bb \u001c\n1 approximations are found easily, and these are given in Table 5.\nClose to onset the solutions with twofold symmetry (Z2\u00d7Zc2 in irreps\n2\/3+ and Dz2 in irreps 2\/3\u2212) are always unstable. Fivefold-symmetric\nsolutions (Z5\u00d7Zc2 in irreps 2\/3+ and Dz5 in irreps 2\/3\u2212) are stable for\n\u03bb > 0 and c2 > c3 in the case of irreps 2\u00b1, and for \u03bb > 0 and c2 < c3\nin the case of irreps 3\u00b1. Threefold-symmetric solutions (Z3 \u00d7 Zc2 in\nirreps 2\/3+ and Dz3 in irreps 2\/3\u2212) are stable for \u03bb > 0 and c2 < c3\nin the case of irreps 2\u00b1, and for \u03bb > 0 and c2 > c3 in the case\nof irreps 3\u00b1. So only one type of solution is stable for any given\ncombination of parameter values, and it will have either fivefold or\nthreefold symmetry.\n10\n3.3 Four-dimensional irreps\nIn the four-dimensional irreps 4\u00b1, the generators are represented by\nthe matrices:\nMg5 =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n0 0 0 \u22121\n1 0 0 \u22121\n0 1 0 \u22121\n0 0 1 \u22121\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n, (16)\nMg2 =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n. (17)\nIrrep 4+ has Mgc = I, while irrep 4\u2212 has Mgc = \u2212I.\nThe amplitude equations for irreps 4\u00b1 can be deduced from the\nequivariance condition and are given in the Appendix. At this order in\nthe expansion, the equations are symmetric under S4, the symmetric\ngroup of order 4; at higher order full Ih symmetry will be seen.\nThe possible solutions at onset for irrep 4+, together with the\neigenvalues governing their stability, can be calculated from the quadratic\ntruncation of the amplitude equation and are given in Table 6. The\nonly solutions are those predicted using the Equivariant Branching\nLemma. None of them are stable at onset, as is to be expected since\nthey bifurcate transcritically [18]. Further from the bifurcation point\nthough, the solutions may gain stability, and the existence of quadratic\nterms in the amplitude equation gives the possibility of hysteresis be-\ntween the icosahedral base state and the bifurcating solution branches.\nIn the case c1 = 0.5, c2 = \u22121 and c3 = 0.7 shown in figure 7 there\n11\nis hysteresis between the T \u00d7 Zc2 solutions and the zero solution, and\nalso a region where both the T \u00d7Zc2 and D3\u00d7Zc2 solutions are stable.\nFor the irrep 4\u2212 the possible solutions at the primary bifurcation\nare given in Table 7 together with the growth rate eigenvalues for per-\nturbations to the solutions. Again an explicit calculation shows that\nthere are no solutions other than those predicted using the Equivariant\nBranching Lemma. The Dz3 and Dz2 solutions can never be stable at\nonset, whereas the T (tetrahedral) and D3 solutions can be. The tetra-\nhedral solutions will be stable if \u03bb > 0 and (1+2c3\/c2) > 0, while the\nD3 solutions will be stable if \u03bb > 0 and (c2 +2c3)(4c2 +5c3) < 0. Both\ntypes of solution cannot be stable for any one set of parameter values,\nsince for both to be stable we must have c2(4c2+5c3) < 0 and if c2 > 0\nand c3 < \u22124c2\/5 we must then have c2 + 2c3 < \u22123c2\/5 < 0, whereas\nthe conditions c2 < 0 and c3 > \u22124c2\/5 give c2 +2c3 > \u22123c2\/5 > 0: in\nboth cases both types of solution are in fact unstable. However, tetra-\nhedral and D3 solutions can be stable in different parameter regimes,\nso one might expect to observe structures with these symmetries in\npractice.\n3.4 Five-dimensional irreps\nThe matrices for the five-dimensional irreps 5\u00b1 are as follows:\nMg5 =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n1 0 0 0 \u22121\n0 0 0 0 \u22121\n0 0 0 1 \u22121\n0 1 0 0 \u22121\n0 0 1 0 \u22121\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n, (18)\n12\nMg2 =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n0 \u22121 1 0 0\n0 \u22121 0 0 0\n1 \u22121 0 0 0\n0 \u22121 0 1 0\n0 \u22121 0 0 1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n. (19)\nIrrep 5+ has Mgc = I, while irrep 5\u2212 has Mgc = \u2212I.\nThe amplitude equations to cubic order for irreps 5\u00b1 are given in\nthe Appendix.\nFor irrep 5+ all the solutions at the primary bifurcation that have\nnontrivial symmetry are given in Table 8 together with the growth\nrate eigenvalues for perturbations. The results are calculated using\nthe quadratic truncation of the amplitude equations. It is possible\nthat there are also solutions with trivial symmetry, not guaranteed by\nthe Equivariant Branching Lemma. If they exist at all it is likely that\nit will only be for certain special values of the parameters. The lattice\nof isotropy subgroups is shown in Figure 8. For all solutions there are\nalways eigenvalues of both signs, and so no solution is stable at onset.\nHowever, at cubic order, analysis of the D5\u00d7Zc2 and D3\u00d7Zc2 branches\ngiven in the table shows that the solutions can become stable far from\nonset, as shown in figure 9 for the case c1 = c2 = \u2212c3 = \u2212c4 = \u2212c5 =\n1. Both the D5 \u00d7 Zc2 and D3 \u00d7 Zc2 solutions can be stable and there\nare regions where the D5 \u00d7 Zc2 solution is stable simultaneously with\nthe zero or D3\u00d7Zc2 solution, so hysteresis is possible. Since we do not\nhave closed form solutions for the D2 \u00d7 Zc2, their behaviour far from\nonset was not investigated.\nThe stability of the solution branches at the primary bifurcation\nin the case of irrep 5\u2212 is determined from the cubic truncation of\n13\nthe amplitude equations given in the Appendix, and the solutions\nand their stability are summarised in Table 9. The lattice of isotropy\nsubgroups is shown in Figure 10. The D3 and D5 solutions can be\nstable at onset if \u03bb > 0 and (11c3 + 5c4 + 2c5) < 0 for D3 or if\n\u03bb > 0 and (11c3 + 5c4 + 2c5 \u00b1\n\u221a\n5c3) > 0 for D5. These are mu-\ntually exclusive possibilities, and if 0 < 11c3 + 5c4 + 2c5 <\n\u221a\n5|c3|\nthen neither solution is stable. The Dz2 solution is always unstable\nat onset: if (14c3 + 5c4 + 2c5)(8c3 + 5c4 + 2c5) > 0 holds the two\neigenvalues involving the square root are real and of opposite sign,\nand if (14c3 + 5c4 + 2c5)(8c3 + 5c4 + 2c5) < 0 then two of the other\neigenvalues have opposite sign. For certain combinations of parame-\nter values there are also submaximal solution branches at the primary\nbifurcation that are not guaranteed by the Equivariant Branching\nLemma. They have symmetry Zrefl2 and are never stable since they\nhave real eigenvalues of opposite sign. It is possible that there are\nalso submaximal primary branches with symmetry Zrot2 of the types\n(z1, z2, z3, z4, z5) = (v, 0, x, y, y) and (z1, z2, z3, z4, z5) = (v, w, v, y, y).\nThe form of the equations indicates that these would bifurcate from\nthe origin, but closed form solutions proved difficult to determine.\nAgain, if these solutions exist at all it is likely only to be for certain\ncombinations of parameter values. A two-dimensional D2-invariant\nsubspace (v, 0, v, y, y) is found as the intersection of the two Zrot2 -\ninvariant subspaces, and indeed D2 is a maximal isotropy subgroup.\nThere are, however, no stationary solutions to the amplitude equations\nof the form (v, 0, v, y, y) with 0 6= v 6= y 6= 0, and hence no stationary\nsolutions with isotropy subgroup D2. An open possibility is that in\nsome parameter regimes there might be solutions with no equal am-\n14\nplitudes and hence no symmetry. The structures one would expect to\nobserve in practice would be those with D3 or D5 symmetry when the\nparameter values are such that one of these solutions is stable.\nSince viruses often have symmetry I rather than Ih, it is also\nof some interest to summarise the situation for the bifurcation with\nsymmetry I. The axial and maximal isotropy subgroups are given\nin Table 10. The relevant amplitude equations are the same as those\nfor the plus irreps in the Ih case, and the solution branches with\nsymmetry group \u0393 at the primary bifurcation will have amplitude z\nand eigenvalues identical to those for the corresponding branch with\nisotropy subgroup \u0393\u00d7 Zc2 in the plus irrep of the Ih case.\n4 Heteroclinic cycles\nHeteroclinic cycles connecting type 3\u2019 and type 3 solutions of Table 9\nare found to exist in the case of the 5\u2212 irrep. Before examining the\nstructure of these cycles we will first dismiss the possibility of stable\nheteroclinic cycles arising at the primary bifurcation in the irreps of\ndimension less than 5.\nStable heteroclinic cycles require a saddle-sink connection in the\nsubspace connecting each pair of solutions in the cycle. There are\nclearly no such cycles in the one-dimensional irrep, nor are there any\nin the three-dimensional irreps since the amplitude equations are in\ngradient form for irreps 2\u00b1 and 3\u00b1. In irrep 4\u2212 neither the solutions\nwith isotropy subgroup \u03c4 nor those with symmetry D3 can be sad-\ndles in one subspace and stable nodes (sinks) in another when \u03bb > 0\nbecause in both cases there is one negative eigenvalue \u22122\u03bb and all\n15\nthree remaining eigenvalues have the same sign, so either all are nega-\ntive, precluding the possibility of a saddle, or the remaining three are\npositive so that the solutions could only be saddles or unstable nodes\n(sources) in any subspace. So the only solutions that could form part\nof a heteroclinic cycle are those with Dz3 or Dz2 symmetry, types 3\/3\u2019\nand 4\/4\u2019 of Table 7 respectively. Now no trajectories can cross the\nhyperplanes zi = 0 or zi = zj (i 6= j), since z\u02d9i and z\u02d9i \u2212 z\u02d9j = 0 respec-\ntively are zero there. This means that the only possible connections\nare between a type 3 and a type 4 solution, a type 3 and a type 4\u2019 or\na type 4\u2019 and a type 3\u2019.\nTo consider the possible connections between a type 3 solution and\ntypes 4 and 4\u2019, it is helpful to choose a concrete example: if we start\nwith (x, 0, 0,\u2212x) (type 3), this can only be connected to (x, x,\u2212x,\u2212x)\nor (x,\u2212x, x,\u2212x) (both type 4) in the subspace (z, y,\u2212y, z) without\ncrossing (zi = 0 or zi = zj (i 6= j). The type 3 solutions in this space\nwill be sinks if (c2 + 2c3) < 0 and saddles if (c2 + 2c3) > 0. Now\nconnecting (x, 0, 0,\u2212x) to the type 4\u2019 solution (2x, 2x, x, 0) via the\nsubspace (z, y + z, (y + z)\/2, y) or to (2x, x, 2x, 0) via (z, (y + z)\/2, y +\nz, y) (again the only permitted links), we find that in these subspaces\nthe type 3 solutions will also be sinks if (c2 + 2c3) < 0 and saddles\nif (c2 + 2c3) > 0. Thus the type 3 solutions are of the same stability\ntype in both subspaces in which they could be used as part of a cycle,\nso the cycle fails at this point. Finally, consider the type 4\u2019 solution\n(2x, 2x, x, 0) used to connect to the type 3 solution above: in that\nsubspace the type 4\u2019 solutions are sinks if (c2 + 2c3) > 0 and saddles\nif (c2 + 2c3) < 0. The point (2x, 2x, x, 0) can also be connected to\nthe type 3\u2019 solutions (x, 2x, x, x) and (2x, x, x, x) via the subspaces\n16\n(z, y + z, (y + z)\/2, y) and (y + z, z, (y + z)\/2, y) respectively. In these\nsubspaces the type 4\u2019 solutions are sinks if (c2 + 2c3) > 0 and saddles\nif (c2 +2c3) < 0, so the type 4\u2019 solutions also are of the same stability\ntype in both subspaces and cannot form part of a heteroclinic cycle.\nThere are no further possibilities of forming such cycles, so we conclude\nthat no heteroclinic cycles exist for the 4\u2212 irrep.\nSimilar arguments to those used for the 4\u2212 irrep lead to the con-\nclusion that the only possible connections in the case of the 4+ irrep\nare between solution types 1 and 2\u2019, 1 and 2, and 1\u2019 and 2\u2019 of Ta-\nble 6. Restricting the evolution to the subspace (z, y, y, y) we find\nthat the solution (x, 0, 0, 0) (type 1) is a saddle there for \u03bb > 0, while\n(0, x, x, x) (type 2\u2019) is a sink and (x, x, x, x) (type 1\u2019) is a saddle. Thus\ntype 2\u2019 cannot be used in any cycle because it is always a sink when\nconnecting to type 1\/1\u2019 solutions. In the subspace (z, 0, 0, y) the type\n1 solution (x, 0, 0, 0) is a saddle and the type 2 solution (x, 0, 0, x) is\na sink, thus the type 1 solution is always a saddle when connecting to\ntype 2\/2\u2019 solutions. There cannot then be any heteroclinic cycles in\nirrep 4+.\nReturning now to the 5\u2212 irrep, it will help to choose a particular\nexample, so we concentrate on the heteroclinic cycle connecting the\nsolutions (x, 0,\u2212x, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, x,\u2212x) and (x, 2x, x, x, x), where x2 =\n\u2212\u03bb\/(10c3 + 4c4 + 4c5) in all cases. The first two points both lie in\nthe subspace (z, 0,\u2212z, y,\u2212y), where the evolution equations take the\nform\ny\u02d9 = \u03bby + 2(5c3 + 2c4 + 2c5)y\n3 + (\u22124c3 \u2212 c4 + 2c5)z2y, (20)\nz\u02d9 = \u03bbz + 2(5c3 + 2c4 + 2c5)z\n3 + (2c3 \u2212 c4 + 2c5)y2z. (21)\nThe stationary points in this system together with their growth rate\n17\neigenvalues e1 and e2 are (z\n2 = \u2212\u03bb\/(10c3+4c4+4c5), y = 0, e1 = \u22122\u03bb,\ne2 = \u03bb(14c3+5c4+2c5)\/(10c3+4c4+4c5)), (y\n2 = \u2212\u03bb\/(10c3+4c4+4c5),\nz = 0, e1 = \u22122\u03bb, e2 = \u03bb(8c3 + 5c4 + 2c5)\/(10c3 + 4c4 + 4c5)) and\n(z2 = \u2212\u03bb(8c3 + 5c4 + 2c5)\/\u03be, y2 = \u2212\u03bb(14c3 + 5c4 + 2c5)\/\u03be, e1 = \u22122\u03bb,\ne2 = \u22122\u03bb(8c3 + 5c4 + 2c5)(14c3 + 5c4 + 2c5)\/\u03be) where \u03be is defined in\nTable 9.\nWe will consider the case where \u03bb > 0, since we are interested\nin the possibility of observing this cycle after the bifurcation from\nthe trivial solution. In the parameter regime 5c3 + 2c4 + 2c5 < 0 and\n(14c3+5c4+2c5)(8c3+5c4+2c5) < 0 only the pure z or pure y solutions\ncan exist, since for the mixed mode we would have z2y2 = (14c3 +\n5c4 + 2c5)(8c3 + 5c4 + 2c5)\u03bb\n2\/\u03be2 < 0, which is obviously forbidden.\nNow either we have \u2212(5c4 +2c5)\/8 < c3 < 0 which makes the solution\n(z, 0,\u2212z, 0, 0) a saddle and the solution (0, 0, 0, y,\u2212y) a sink, or we\nhave 0 < c3 < \u2212(5c4 + 2c5)\/8 which makes (z, 0,\u2212z, 0, 0) a sink and\n(0, 0, 0, y,\u2212y) a saddle. There are no periodic orbits in the system\nsince any periodic orbit would have to enclose a fixed point, but the\ncoordinate axes on which the fixed points lie are invariant and so no\ntrajectory can cross them. Every trajectory must approach either a\nfixed-point or a periodic orbit by the Poincare\u00b4-Bendixson theorem,\nso the trajectory leaving the saddle point must approach the sink\nor the origin or escape to infinity. The origin is an unstable node,\nso the trajectory will not end there, thus as long as we can show\nthat trajectories come in from infinity, there must be a saddle-sink\nconnection in the subspace.\nIn polar coordinates y = r cos \u03c6, z = r sin\u03c6 we have\nr\u02d9 = \u03bbr +\n3\n2\n(3c3 + c4 + 2c5)r\n3 +\n1\n2\n(11c3 + 5c4 + 2c5)r\n3 cos2(2\u03c6) (22)\n18\nfrom equations ( 20) and ( 21). If 11c3 + 5c4 + 2c5 > 0 then\nr\u02d9 \u2264 \u03bbr + 2(5c3 + 2c4 + 2c5)r3, (23)\nso since 5c3 + 2c4 + 2c5 < 0 we have r\u02d9 < 0 for r\n2 > \u2212\u03bb\/[2(5c3 + 2c4 +\n2c5)], and all trajectories enter or stop on the boundary of a circle of\nradius\n\u221a\u2212\u03bb\/[2(5c3 + 2c4 + 2c5)]. If on the other hand 11c3 + 5c4 +\n2c5 < 0 then\nr\u02d9 \u2264 \u03bbr + 3\n2\n(3c3 + c4 + 2c5)r\n3, (24)\nand to be sure that all trajectories come in from infinity we must have\n3c3 + c4 + 2c5 < 0, and then all trajectories will enter or stop on the\nboundary of a circle of radius\n\u221a\n\u22122\u03bb\/[3(3c3 + c4 + 2c5)]. In either\ncase trajectories come in from infinity and so there is a saddle-sink\nconnection between (0, 0, 0, y,\u2212y) and (z, 0,\u2212z, 0, 0) in the subspace.\nNow the points (0, 0, 0, x,\u2212x) and (x, 2x, x, x, x) both lie in the\nsubspace (y, 2y, y, y + z, y \u2212 z), where the equations for y\u02d9 and z\u02d9 are\nthe same as those given in equations ( 20) and ( 21) above. We\nmaintain the requirements that \u03bb > 0, 5c3 +2c4 +2c5 < 0 and (14c3 +\n5c4 + 2c5)(8c3 + 5c4 + 2c5) < 0 hold. The first solution is given by\nz2 = \u2212\u03bb\/(10c3 + 4c4 + 4c5), y = 0 (e1 = \u22122\u03bb, e2 = \u03bb(14c3 + 5c4 +\n2c5)\/(10c3 +4c4 +4c5)) and the second by y\n2 = \u2212\u03bb\/(10c3 +4c4 +4c5),\nz = 0 (e1 = \u22122\u03bb, e2 = \u03bb(8c3 +5c4+2c5)\/(10c3 +4c4+4c5)). So in this\nsubspace the solution (0, 0, 0, x,\u2212x) is a sink for the same parameter\nvalues at which it is a saddle in the first subspace and vice-versa.\nUsing the same reasoning as before there is a saddle-sink connection\nin this subspace because the solution (x, 2x, x, x, x) is a saddle when\n(0, 0, 0, x \u2212 x) is a sink and vice-versa.\nFinally to complete the cycle, consider the subspace (z + y, 2z, z\u2212\ny, z, z), which contains the solutions (x, 2x, x, x, x) and (x, 0,\u2212x, 0, 0).\n19\nAgain the evolution equations are given by ( 20) and ( 21) above.\nSo (x, 0,\u2212x, 0, 0) is a saddle when it is a sink in the first subspace\n(and vice versa), and (x, 2x, x, x, x) is a saddle when it is a sink in the\nsecond subspace and vice versa. Furthermore there is a saddle-sink\nconnection between (x, 0,\u2212x, 0, 0) and (x, 2x, x, x, x).\nThe heteroclinic cycle is shown diagrammatically in figure 11. This\ncycle is expected to be stable because each of the stationary points in-\nvolved has two negative, one positive and two purely imaginary eigen-\nvalues in the full five-dimensional space (see Table 9), so the unsta-\nble manifold is one-dimensional and stable manifold two-dimensional.\nOther similar cycles involving solutions with Dz2 symmetry also exist,\nbut there are no stable heteroclinic cycles for \u03bb > 0 involving the D3\nsolutions because these have either five eigenvalues with negative real\npart or one with negative and four with positive real part, depend-\ning on parameter values, thus ruling out the possibility of finding one\nsubspace of two or more dimensions in which the solution would be a\nsaddle and another subspace in which it would be a sink. Neither are\nthere stable cycles involving the D5 solutions, because these solutions\nare always of the same stability type in all the three-dimensional sub-\nspaces (invariant under Zrot2 ) in which they appear. This latter reason\nalso rules out any stable cycles involving the D3 \u00d7 Zc2 or D5 \u00d7 Zc2\nsolutions in the 5+ irrep.\nEach D2 \u00d7 Zc2-invariant subspace in the 5+ irrep contains three\nsaddle points with D2\u00d7Zc2 symmetry (the D2\u00d7Zc2 solutions of Table 8)\nand a node at the origin. The saddles are joined by invariant lines to\nthe origin, and have eigenvalues \u2212\u03bb along the invariant line [20] and\n3\u03bb transverse to it. Since the behaviour in the transverse direction is\n20\nthe same for each saddle point, there are no trajectories joining any\ntwo of them. Any trajectories leaving the saddle points in the D2\u00d7Zc2-\ninvariant subspace end up either at the origin, which cannot be part\nof any cycle as all its eigenvalues are of the same sign, or at infinity.\nThus the D2 \u00d7 Zc2 solutions cannot form part of a stable heteroclinic\ncycle.\nFinally, there are no stable heteroclinic cycles at the primary bi-\nfurcation when we are considering the icosahedral group without re-\nflections, I, because the behaviour in that case is related to that of\nthe plus irreps as explained above.\nThe heteroclinic cycles in the 5\u2212 irrep can exist in parameter\nregimes where the D3 and D5 solutions bifurcate supercritically and\nare unstable: for example choose c3 = \u22121\/4, c4 = 1 and c5 = \u22121\nfor the cycle to run in the direction shown in figure 11 or c3 = 3\/32,\nc4 = 1\/5 and c5 = \u22121 for it to run in the opposite direction. Thus we\nmight expect the cycles to be observable in practice.\n5 Conclusion\nIn summary, we have found that the possible stable solution branches\nat onset in a stationary bifurcation with icosahedral Ih symmetry are\nthose with isotropy subgroups I, Z2 \u00d7 Zc2, Z3 \u00d7 Zc2, Z5 \u00d7 Zc2, Dz2, Dz3,\nDz5 , T , D3 or D5. In addition T \u00d7 Zc2, D3 \u00d7 Zc2 and D5 \u00d7 Zc2 solu-\ntions can become stable far from onset. There is unusual competition\nbetween twofold, threefold and fivefold symmetric structures in irreps\n2\u00b1, 3\u00b1 and 5\u00b1, between tetrahedral and threefold symmetry in irrep\n4+ and between tetrahedral, threefold and twofold symmetry in irrep\n21\n4\u2212. Irrep 1\u2212 gives rise, as expected, to a branch of solutions with\nicosahedral symmetry.\nInterestingly, stable heteroclinic cycles between solutions with Dz2\nsymmetry appear to bifurcate supercritically from the origin for cer-\ntain combinations of parameters in the case of irrep 5\u2212. This can\nhappen when all other known solutions bifurcate supercritically and\nare unstable, so these cycles might be expected to be observable in\npractice.\nIn nanocluster formation, a perfect Mackay icosahedron of 13 atoms\nis energetically preferred, but if an atom is gained the preferred struc-\nture has Dz3 or Dz2 symmetry (depending on the range of the inter-\natomic force) [14] [15], and if one is lost the symmetry becomes Dz5 (or\nDd4 for very short range interatomic forces). The same bifurcation to\nDz3 on gaining an atom and Dz5 on losing an atom is shown at inter-\nmediate values of the interatomic force range for the 55 atom Mackay\nicosahedral cluster [14]. This behaviour is suggestive of a bifurcation\nwith Ih governed by the 2\u2212 or 3\u2212 irrep. When the 45 atom anti-\nMackay icosahedron is preferred it loses symmetry to a Dz5 structure\non losing an atom (again an irrep 2-\/3- process), but on gaining one\nthe resulting structure has only Zrefl2 symmetry, which is not predicted\nby theory in the general case.\nUnder certain circumstances [11] [12] an icosahedral solution is\npreferred at the primary bifurcation from a spherical base state, but is\nunstable. The final realised solution then may be one preferred at the\nbifurcation with icosahedral symmetry, with isotropy subgroup among\nthose listed above. A further possibility, if the secondary bifurcation\nwere governed by irrep 5\u2212, is that the end state might be a stable\n22\nheteroclinic cycle.\nIcosahedral viruses appear only to undergo configurational changes\nthat respect the icosahedral symmetry, but as discussed above this\nmay be an artefact of the imaging process.
