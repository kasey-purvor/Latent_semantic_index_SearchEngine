This paper addresses the pedagogical potential of communication technology for curricular\ndevelopment in schools, initial teacher education and continuing professional development. It establishes\nprinciples of practice based on activities undertaken within a national project involving schools and\nhigher-education institutions.\nIntroduction\nThis paper seeks to outline the implications for pupils and teachers of Modern Foreign\nLanguages (MFL) of the use of communication and information technologies (C&IT). It\nis based on the experiences of one of the school\/university partnerships involved in the BT\nInitial Teacher Training Communication Technologies Initiative, begun in the autumn\nterm of 1996. By examining examples of projects undertaken with minimal training, it will\nestablish some principles for further development in an area that is manifestly innovative\nfor the majority of those involved in secondary schools.\nThe BT initial teacher training initiative was primarily designed 'to increase understanding\nof how communication technologies can enrich teaching and learning' (BT, 1997, 8).\nAccordingly, the main objectives for the use of communication technologies were:\n\u2022 as a teaching and learning resource for pupils in the classroom;\n\u2022 for trainee-to-trainee peer support between the higher-education institutions (HEIs)\ninvolved;\n\u2022 for remote supervision and counselling of trainees by their tutors;\n\u2022 for remote in-service provision by the HEIs for school staff;\n\u2022 for BT co-ordination and management of the project.\nThe communication technologies available were email, Campus World and the Internet,\n43\nNigel Norman Communication technologies and education: lessons in the potential of innovation\nfax, telephone, and videoconferencing using PCC VC8000 (ISDN) videoconferencing\nequipment. In practice, the preferred media proved to be email and (especially)\nvideoconferencing, even though these were generally perceived to be areas in which\nparticipants had little or no knowledge or skills. It is with videoconferencing that this\npaper is primarily concerned.\nWith objectives that catered for a variety of users (pupils, student teachers, teachers,\nuniversity tutors), a common initial aim had to be establishing familiarity with and ease of\nhandling of the equipment. Clearly, one has to understand what the equipment is capable\nof before tapping its pedagogic potential. Training needs dictate that the manual skill of\nhandling the equipment becomes, if not second nature, at least an activity carried out with\nconfidence, and one based on a simple set of working instructions with fail-safe techniques\ncatered for (as, in fact, in any well-prepared lesson). Underlying the whole should be the\nquestions: does this enhance the teaching and learning process? does the technology\nprovide access to different learning experiences? With reference specifically to electronic\ncommunications, Davis (1997) indicates the nature of the challenge facing education:\nBy 1996 electronic communications had proved their value to enhance learning, but\nmost activities have been outside the normal curriculum. In future, the structure of\nteaching and learning may change to permit communications technologies to play as\nimportant a role in education as they do in commerce.\nAnd Mason (in Mason and Bacsich, 1994, 36-7), discussing the educational value of ISDN,\na common 'engine' for videoconferencing, sounds a warning but also sees its great potential:\nISDN [. . .] will not totally transform education and training, but what it will do is\nintegrate voice, text and video onto the students' and teachers' desktop. It does provide\na very broad base on which to build education and training applications: large-scale\nvideoconferencing, small group co-operative learning, computer-based packages, multi-\nmedia interactive sessions, and very fast file exchange and access to learning resources.\nBenefits of C&IT in schools\nThe world of education and training may need persuading of the benefits to individual\nlearners of using C&IT, since there is already evidence that new technologies have simply\nbeen used in a traditional transmissive mode, pouring, to use the analogy of Wright and\nCordeaux, new wine from old bottles: 'Regarding it simply as a tool to deliver distance\nlecturing using didactic teaching approaches misses the point. Without a change of\nemphasis, the major capability of the technology to support learning is excluded' (Wright\nand Cordeaux, 1996).\nThe 1996 NCET publication on teacher training and computer-mediated communications\n(CMC) (NCET, 1996) outlines the potential benefits to teachers and learners in terms of\ncollaboration, autonomy and support: peer group interaction, self-paced work, and access\nto peer and tutor advice almost on demand. It emphasises the role that CMC has to play as\na support mechanism in professional development and training, referring to Mason (1994)\nwho identified in particular the following:\n44\nALT-J Volume 5 Number 3\n\u2022 enhanced tutorial support;\n\u2022 a forum for interaction between teachers and learners;\n\u2022 a medium for mutual support;\n\u2022 access to expert debate;\n\u2022 a teaching medium;\n\u2022 course delivery.\nOf these, the single and most palpable enhancement achieved through videoconferencing is\nsimultaneous face-to-face interaction at a distance. In the school context, pupils in one\nschool can link with pupils elsewhere nationally or internationally, exchange information,\nand develop oral and written skills. Thus five pupils from a Year 8 French class at Cardiff\nHigh School talked about themselves and their interests to pupils at Glenwood High\nSchool in Scotland, who relayed similar details back - all in French.\nOn the face of it, this would not seem to suggest much more than a high-speed version of\nwhat goes on already, albeit with the added novelty of technology to lend immediacy and\nexcitement. This naturally increases motivation and with it learning. However, the\ntechnology has enabled the production of a significant additional motivational factor: a\ngenuine audience. After all, in the standard classroom situation, pupils and teacher know\neach other, the school, the area and so on - that is, there is familiarity of context Thus, in\nthe Modern Languages classroom, pupils are continually using the foreign language to ask\nquestions, the answers to which are already known to all concerned. This is language\nrehearsal, rather than language use. Language is not serving a communicative purpose, but\nis practising, as it were, for the real thing. However, in face-to-face interaction with\nunknown interlocutors, the language fulfils a function, solves a problem, provides an\noutcome. As the MFL student teachers at Cardiff High School found, 'the stimulus of\nhaving to prepare for \"publication\" and \"broadcast\" is an excellent incentive for maximum\neffort and thought' (BT, 1997,10). In this way, the work with the technology can be seen to\nbe integrated into, indeed arise from, the normal curriculum work, and not as an extra,\nbolt-on activity. More significant, however, are the learning benefits that will have accrued\nin the process. Pupils will have developed skills of collaboration and autonomy,\ncommunication, and presentation. As Davis (1994) points out:\nInformation provided by pupils in another location is not mediated by the publishing\nprocess and such 'raw' data is frequently more relevant to the pupils than that in a\ntextbook. The communication process becomes intense with participants focusing on\nboth the immediate changes visible on the computer screen and the personal contact of\nthe voice.\nHopkins (1995, 212) makes a similar point with reference to the use of interactive video\nwith ISDN access for teaching English as a second language:\nBecause each student is effectively isolated from the rest of the class, he or she is forced\nto rely on the language to communicate effectively. In contrast, when physically-\ngrouped together messages can be sent with a shrug, grin or a groan, spontaneous\n45\nNigel Norman Communication technologies and education: lessons in the potential of innovation\nnative language exchanges are also likely. Properly used, the technology may actually\nenhance the teacher's ability to guide the student.\nForeign-language learning\nIt could, of course, be argued that our situation is still an artificial one. English-speaking\npupils in Wales are communicating with English-speaking pupils in Scotland, who will be\nfollowing a similar, if not identical, curriculum. The material exchanged will essentially be\nfamiliar, the topics covered the same, the language used will be pre-prepared and 'staged'.\nThe experience of the student teacher at Glenwood High School, while linked with Cardiff\nHigh School, was that 'pupils did not revert to their native tongue when they got stuck, but\nshe did find that the pupils relied on what they had already prepared to say and did not\nventure to ask questions' (BT, 1997, 17). She attributes this in part to the lack of true eye-\nto-eye contact due to the positioning of the videoconferencing camera. In other words, the\nvery medium itself, while improving communication, was actually setting up another\nbarrier, inhibiting spontaneity (in this context, see Jacobs and Rodgers, 1997). Self-\nconsciousness is not simply a product of the technology, however, and will undoubtedly be\nremoved with increased use of the equipment. Let us underline the principle once more:\nthe establishment of videoconference links between pupils studying languages provides a\ngenuine purpose for oral communication that goes beyond that of the normal classroom.\nThe issue of authenticity is methodologically contentious in Modern Language teaching.\nShould one use raw, unedited, authentic source material in the target language, or should there\nbe some element of pedagogic intervention, of tailoring content to suit the ability of the\nlearner? Equally, should one make videoconferencing contact on the basis of familiar-ity of\ncontext and culture, i.e. English-speaking pupils communicating with English- speaking pupils,\nor opt instead for linking with the foreign country itself? In the absence of an established\nfamily-to-family exchange programme, C&IT can clearly bring the foreign country directly into\nthe classroom, providing a taste at least for those unable to travel or otherwise gain first-hand\nexperience of the foreign culture. In this way French, German and other languages are seen as\nreal languages, not simply as academic school subjects. While national links are perhaps an\nessential starting point, the future must lie with international developments. In any event,\nhowever, videoconferencing establishes face-to-face contact and realizes the potential for\ndeveloping both oral and written skills, while bringing a vital touch of authentic culture into\nthe classroom and providing an authentic audience for genuine communicative activity.\nFurther projects planned at Cardiff High School include the video-recording of scenes\naround the school with commentary in French, which will then be transmitted to pupils in\nGlenwood High School (once again it is apparent that this would have increased worth if\nthe exchange were with a school in France). Also planned are exchanges of posters,\npostcards, and leaflets using fax, and personal letters, on a pen-pal basis, using email.\nIn a curriculum area that by definition has communication at its very core, it is self-evident\nthat C&IT has a central role to play in the teaching and learning of languages. In\nconsidering, in another context, the motivating factors behind an MFL Newspaper Day\nproject, Davis (1994) observes:\nCommunication technology is one of the few ways to make external sources of input\nreally meaningful in the confines of a Languages classroom. Pupils begin to see that\nthey can have access to the real world of languages used for real purposes.\n46\nALT-J Volume 5 Number 3\nFurthermore, it is not simply the medium and its intrinsic novelty that bring added\nmotivation and realism to the learning process. The pedagogical benefits associated with\nthe preparation of materials for a genuine audience have to do with pride in presentation,\nownership of information, sharing, social interaction, sense of purpose.\nA final example of the potential of the medium in the area of MFL is whiteboarding, a\ntechnique that can be used at any level. Using the software provided with the\nvideoconference facility, a high degree of interaction can be achieved. For example, pupils\nin one school can give oral descriptions of themselves, which the receiving pupils can note\ndown or draw. The all-too-familiar topic of Finding the Way Around Town can take on\nnew life when pupils give directions to their link school which the receiving pupils follow\non the screen, simultaneously learning something about a town they do not know. Visuals\nwithout text for a cartoon strip provided by one school can be completed with speech\nbubbles or captions by the other school. Inter-school surveys on favourite sports, hobbies,\nschool subjects, or holidays will produce interesting contrasts and cultural comparisons,\nwhich can then be further processed into bar charts for display using other IT applications.\nThere could be joint production of posters, classroom displays, quizzes, newspapers,\nschool and town brochures, and, of course, games: noughts and crosses (practising\nnumbers, letters, etc.), Bingo, Blockbusters.\nTeacher training and professional development\nWhile pupils' knowledge and skills will be enhanced in the ways mentioned above, there are\nmajor implications for student teachers' initial training. Indeed, the very title of the project\n(BT Initial Teacher Training Communication Technologies Initiative) recognizes this. By\nsupporting partnerships between HEIs and schools, training and development is facilitated\nin four directions: to school pupils, student teachers, teachers, and university tutors. Let us\nnext consider student teachers.\nStudent teachers are challenged to think of ways of managing language input and\norganizing pupils effectively to use technology in appropriate ways. In spite of pupils'\nrelative confidence with information technology, one has still perhaps to beware of the\n'Friday afternoon' syndrome, the tendency to regard the use of computers as 'a bit of fun',\nnot real learning. Part of the training therefore involves a destigmatizing process, a fresh\nappraisal of attitudes (though this may well be more applicable to experienced teachers!).\nIt is crucial to promote a spirit of critical reflection that enables teachers and student\nteachers to evaluate professionally the advantages and disadvantages of the technology,\nnot to advocate its use for spurious reasons.\nIn the same way as pupils are required by the National Curriculum to be given\nopportunities to use information technology, so too should student teachers (DFE\/WO,\n1992,8). Until the present, this will have consisted largely of using subject-specific software\n(games, simulations, text manipulation packages, databases) and word-processing, but will\nnow have to include C&IT applications such as videoconferencing and email. There are\nclear resource implications for schools and HEIs here, obviously a potential obstacle to\nfurther development. It cannot be left to projects such as the BT initiative to supply a mere\nhandful of schools and HEIs with the necessary hardware and experience that will\neventually become an integral part of learning in the next century.\n47\nNigel Norman Communication technologies and education: lessons in the potential of innovation\nWhile the use of the technology depends on availability, its application in the learning\ncontext will be as much a matter of organization and management as linguistic and\npedagogical skills. Thus the arranging of pupils to prepare particular tasks, individually or\nin pairs or groups, the monitoring of the actual language content, the correction (if\nappropriate) of pronunciation and delivery or written outcome, will all be essential\ncompetences to be acquired. Somekh and Davies (1991) itemize in some detail what should\nconstitute a revised agenda for some teacher training programmes. For example, in general,\nteachers should:\n\u2022 set tasks, including but not only computer-mediated tasks, which require learners to\nengage in higher-order cognitive processes (e.g. synthesizing, analysing, reconstructing\nand creating on the basis of information and experience);\n\u2022 reflect on students' learning (i.e. identifying specific learning outcomes from listening\nto talk, observing action, and evaluating with learners the results of their work);\n\u2022 respond to students' needs as they emerge rather than pushing through a pre-specified\nteacher agenda;\n\u2022 recognize that there is a necessary hiatus period when students are engaging in tasks\ninvolving problem-solving and decision-making, and restrain the desire to clarify the\ntask too early.\nSome may see this as a relinquishing of teacher control, an abandonment to the whims of\nthe machine and the random indiscipline of play, but it is surely an inevitable consequence\nof such an exponential, and ultimately uncontrollable, source of learning. If, among many\npedagogic by-products, there can be, for example, a shift in the balance of students'\nactivities from laborious tasks, for example drawing graphs, to higher level tasks for\nexample interpreting graphs (see Somekh and Davies, 1991), the enhancement to learning\nis self-evident. C&IT will ipso facto contribute to greater autonomy in learning, not, as\nsome would have it, replacing the teacher, but extending and enriching his\/her role. In this\ncontext, the configuration of teacher, student and computer changes the traditional\nstructure of teaching and learning in the classroom. As Somekh and Davies (1991) rightly\nnote, the computer reduces the dependency of student on the teacher.\nNot only can student teachers enhance pupils' learning by enabling them to prepare and\nshare material, but they can also share ideas for teaching resources, lesson planning and so\non, with their tutor or their counterparts in other HEIs and schools. Clearly, this latter use\nlends itself also to in-service training and consultations between university and school.\nWright and Cordeaux (1996) summarize the dual outcomes of a videoconferencing project\nfor student teachers as well as colleagues in school:\nThe student trial group [...] found greatest use of the technology in providing real time\ncollaborative working which they did in exchanging lesson materials and plans and in\ncreating two user guides for the technology. School colleagues are now using the\ntechnology for administration and support and [...] for distance lesson observation.\nIt is interesting to compare in this connection the experiences of Open University PGCE\nstudents who, by means of the computer-conferencing software First Class, are able to\n48\nALT-J Volume 5 Number 3\ncommunicate with other student teachers and their tutors, in a context that demands the\nuse of distance-learning facilities. Admittedly, in this case the videoconferencing element is\nabsent. Nevertheless, the value of the facility as a support and learning tool has been\nperceived to be fundamental. The NCET publication on teacher training and information\ntechnology (NCET, 1997) documents the following advantages identified by students:\nthey feel less isolated;\nit helps them prepare for day schools and tutorials (pre-reading and agenda setting);\nthey can share good practice;\nthey can seek reassurance in a small group whose members they know well;\nit is convenient since it is asynchronous;\nthey can easily pick up administration information.\nSimilarly, the facility can be used for consultations with university tutors, feedback on\nlessons, and written assignments - in short, remote supervision of any aspect of the\ntraining course. With visits by tutors to schools becoming less frequent, and the time\npressure on teacher-mentors remaining a problem, this may well come to be seen as one of\nthe single most beneficial, economic as well as educational, features of C&IT. The work of\nthe university tutor in education differs from that of other university teachers more\naccustomed to the lecture mode. For this reason, Laurillard (1993) sees little scope for\nvideoconferencing as an interactive instrument for university teaching, regarding it as\ndefinitely a presentational and discursive medium. Inevitably, this fact is exploited by\nlecturers, and the potential interaction with students rarely occurs. Laurillard concludes\nthat 'on balance, the two-way visual link is hard to justify in an educational context. The\ncurrent technology makes it an uncomfortable way to negotiate a shared conception'(167).\nThis is of course more of a criticism of the pedagogical limitations of the lecture format\nthan a comment on videoconferencing as a whole, for while it is undeniable that a video\nwould be a cheaper and easier way of transmitting a didactic lecture, the nature of the\ninteraction between tutor and student teacher is of a very different order. Highly\nindividualized and personal, overcoming the burdens of distance and time and responding\nto immediate needs, it in fact takes on something of the character of a vital lifeline.\nThe principle of 'timeshift', in which a video recording is made of a student teacher's\nlesson and is sent downline to the university tutor for joint evaluation, is a further example\nof the cost-effective deployment of resources. With improvements to digital video quality,\nthis again may prove a vital support, especially to student teachers at risk of failing, and\nwho need intensive additional advice. The flexibility to pinpoint specific actions, and to\nenable the student teacher to analyse his\/her practice with freeze-frame evidence, is\ncompelling and dynamic, although we have been aware, at Cardiff High School and at\nSwansea, of 'issues about which has the greatest effect on classroom behaviour, the\npresence of a visiting tutor or a video camera' (BT, 1997, 11), and would hope to reconcile\nthis tension in future. Needless to say, such support can also be provided in written format\nusing email or fax, but Davis (1997), for example, describes a 'conference' in which agenda\npoints selected by the student teacher for the mentor to observe while the student taught,\nformed the basis of a supervisory session with the university tutor, and outlines the\nadditional effectiveness of the videoconference link:\n49\nNigel Norman Communication technologies and education: lessons in the potential of innovation\nEarly work using multimedia telecommunications for the supervisory conference with\nthe university tutor suggests that the telecommunication enhances the student's\nreflection. We think this may be because the student teacher recognises that he or she\nmust take the lead in preparing for the supervisory conference, and because of this, and\nthe individual focus of the telecommunications link, the student gains more insight into\nthe process of teaching and learning.\nAs with school pupils, the question of whether the technology provides an enhancement to\nteaching and learning is almost a rhetorical one. The use of videoconferencing (and email)\nenables student teachers to provide pupils with a relevant and realistic outcome for the\npurposeful communication of language to a genuine target audience. It develops essential\norganizational and management skills, and provides a unique opportunity for\ncommunication at a distance with fellow student-teachers and university tutors, and\nconsequent development of critical professionalism.\nProfessional development\nWhat role does C&IT have to play in the continuing professional development of teachers?\nVideoconferencing lends itself well to in-service training, previously conducted on site in\nschool or at the university, but here obviating the need for travel and saving tutor's\nexpenses and disruption to a teacher's day. The technology also allows the use of software\napplications such as PowerPoint for additional polish of presentation, rather than\noverhead transparencies. The very use of the videoconferencing equipment will provide the\nopportunity for otherwise perhaps inexperienced teachers to acquire competence in its use,\nand it thus fulfils a dual professional training purpose. Teachers can link up with\ncolleagues in other schools and institutions to share ideas, resources, converse in the target\nlanguage, in the same way as their pupils. The use of the facility for discussions between\nuniversity tutors and senior mentors in schools, for example on matters which require\nelucidation in course programmes, particularly involving visual material, is manifestly\nhighly valuable. The university tutor can also 'virtually' attend in-school seminars, once\ncertain technical pre-requisites have been met. Here, as in any other new undertaking or\none that relies on technical management, one should not be daunted by inevitable 'teething\nproblems'. The potential of the medium far outweighs any false starts or slight\ninconvenience.\nIn the same way as there are statutory obligations upon student teachers and pupils to\nacquire information-technology capability, so too are existing qualified teachers judged,\namong other things, on the effective integration of information technology into their\nteaching: 'Standards achieved by pupils are to be determined by evaluating their\ncompetence in the key skills within reading, writing, speaking and listening, number and\ninformation technology, in the curriculum as a whole' (OFSTED, 1991). This will need to\nstart with positive attitudes, not a grudging and sceptical tolerance, and extend to (NCET,\n1995):\n\u2022 an understanding of the educational potential of IT;\n\u2022 an ability to use IT effectively in the curriculum;\n\u2022 an ability to manage IT use in the classroom;\n50\nAa-J Volume 5 Number 3\n\u2022 an ability to evaluate IT use;\n\u2022 an ability to ensure differentiation and progression;\n\u2022 a technical capability;\n\u2022 issues of time, access, resources, training, and the status of IT;\nUltimately, however, professional development is concerned as much with personal\nempowerment as with prescription and uniformity of standards. Colleagues will appreciate\nthe time-saving and cost-cutting possibilities for in-service training, workshops, lectures\nand talks opened up by telecommunication links, as well as the inevitable value of\ncurricular project work with pupils as discussed above. The ability to access huge amounts\nof information, and to transform this into learning material revitalizes teaching, keeps the\nteacher up to date, and assists reflection and adaptability to change. In this connection,\nSomekh and Davies (1991) state that 'changing societies need to educate for change', and\ncite Dewey's vision of the kind of society in which transformation of educational processes\nis possible:\nParticularly is it true that a society which not only changes but which has the ideal of\nsuch change as will improve it, will have different standards and methods of education\nfrom one which aims simply at the perpetuation of its own customs. (Dewey, 1961,81)\nConclusion\nIn their wide-ranging, psychologically thoroughly-grounded paper that seeks to establish a\nmodel for a pedagogy for information technology, Somekh and Davies (1991) offer useful\ndefinitions of pedagogical competencies possessed by teachers and learners, which assume\nthat:\n\u2022 learning arises from active engagement of the learner;\n\u2022 this engagement gives both teachers and learners cognitively active roles, since\nknowledge is constructed and reconstructed through heuristic processes of creative\nthinking and interaction, as well as the acquisition of appropriate information;\n\u2022 the assessment of competence depends on listening, observing and responding to\nlearners reflecting on their products (written or spoken); and on the exercise of\njudgement (including learners'judgements) within a coherent and explicit value system.\nTechnology is contributing to the shift from a knowledge-based, teacher-transmission\nmodel of learning to one that is process-based, and learner-oriented. Wright and Cordeaux\n(1996) refer to 'a changed approach and understanding of the teaching and learning\nprocesses' which arise from the capacity of the technology for 'flexibility, intimacy,\nopportunities for real interaction and collaborative working in real time'. The learner can\naccess information and knowledge from a variety of sources, including the teacher, but the\nassimilation and application of new knowledge is being transformed by the enormous\npower and potential of the technology. Somekh and Davies (1991) identify in this process a\nnumber of 'dimensions of pedagogic change' that involve a movement:\n\u2022 from individualized to communicative learning;\n51\nNigel Norman Communication technologies and education: lessons in the potential of innovation\n\u2022 from a view of the teacher's role as an organizer of learning activities to one as an\nenabler of quality learning experiences, using the minimum pre-specified structure;\n\u2022 from a view of technology as either a tutor or a tool to one where it interacts in a\nvariety of ways with learners, sometimes providing ideas, sometimes providing a\nresource for enquiry, and sometimes supporting creativity.\nAt the same time, and more pragmatically, pupils are being given the opportunities, as\nrequired by the National Curriculum, to develop their information technology capability\nand to use a range of resources for communicating. C&IT can open the doors of the\nclassroom to the world, enhancing and extending the curriculum for those involved in the\nteaching and learning process: pupils, student teachers, teachers, and teacher trainers. By\nproviding a genuine focus for communicative language activity, videoconferencing (and\nemail) develop not only oral (and written) skills, but technical and social competence,\ncollaboration and autonomy. Student teachers develop organizational and management\ntechniques, in addition to benefitting from remote supervision and the ability to reflect on\nand analyse the teaching and learning process and to construct new concepts of pedagogy.\nTeachers are enabled to redefine their role and explore the possibilities opened up by wider\naccess to sources of information and knowledge. Teacher trainers can support student\nteachers and teachers without leaving their base - something which is particularly valuable\nin the days of school-based training. As Davis (1997) reminds us, communication is a\nfundamental process of education: 'When the mode of communication changes, the\norganisation must change also'.\nOur experience at Cardiff High School and the University of Wales Swansea has begun to\nchange our organizations, and has provided us with valuable lessons in the potential of\ninnovation, which we trust will soon become an entitlement for all.\nReferences\nBT (1997), Good Beginnings: Good Connections, BT Initial Teacher Training\nCommunication Technologies Initiative, London: British Telecommunications pic.\nDavis, N.
