Much of the tectonic and climatic history in high-relief regions, such as the \nmountains ofthe western U.S. Basin and Range province, is contained in the mort?holo \u2022 \nof hillslopes, drainage networks, and other landforms that range in scale from 10-' to 10 \u2022 \nkm. To understand how these landforms evolve, we have developed a numerical andscape \nevolution model that combines a detailed tectonic displacement field with a set of \nphysically based geomorphic rules. Bedrock landsliding, long recognized as a significant \ngeomorphic process in mountainous topography, is for the first time explicitly included in \nthe rule set. In a series of numerical experiments, we generate synthetic landscapes that \nclosely resemble mountainous topography observed in the Basin and Range. The \nproduction of realistic landscapes depends critically on the presence of bedrock landslides, \nand landsliding yields rates of long-term erosion that are comparable in magnitude to \nthose of fluvial erosion. The erosive efficiency of bedrock landsliding implies that \nhillslopes may respond very quickly to changes in local base level and that fluvial erosion \nis the rate-limiting process in steady state experimental andscapes. Our experiments \ngenerate power law distributions of landslide sizes, somewhat similar to both field and \nlaboratory observations. Thus even a simple model of bedrock landsliding is capable of \nquantitatively reproducing mountainous topography and landslide distributions and \nrepresents a significant step forward in our understanding of the evolution of normal-fault- \nbounded ranges. \n1. Introduction \nDespite recent interest in the interplay between tectonics \nand topography [Merritts and Ellis, 1994, and references there- \nin), the evolution of mountainous topography at the landform \nscale remains poorly understood. While the gross morphology \nof a particular mountain range or orogen may reflect the large- \nscale forces that have shaped it [Elliott, 1976; Suppe, 1981; \nKoons, 1989; Beaumont et al., 1998], additional information on \nthe tectonic and climatic history of the range is contained in \nlandforms that are one to several kilometers in extent, includ- \ning individual hillslopes and catchments, faceted spurs, and \ndepositional fans. \nA numerical model of landscape volution provides one way \nto explore the sensitivity of different landforms to tectonic and \nclimatic processes and may be used to compare the relative \nroles of various processes in shaping the landscape. Most land- \nscape evolution models (LEMs) have focused on orogenic- \nscale landscapes and have reasonably ignored the finer details \nof the topography [Koons, 1989;Anderson, 1994; Gilchrist et al., \n1994; Kooi and Beaumont, 1994; Tucker and Slingerland, 1994, \n1996]. A disadvantage of these orogen-scale LEMs is that they \nrequire coarse spatial resolutions and lumped parameter rule \nsets, which limit the extraction of tangible or measurable in- \nCopyright 1998 by the American Geophysical Union. \nPaper number 98JB00510. \n0148-0227\/98\/98JB-00510509.00 \nformation from the model results. In a high-resolution model \nlike the one we develop here, geomorphic rule sets may be \ngrounded in the physics of specific processes. Landform evo- \nlution may then be linked to measurable relative process rates. \nRecent LEMs have proposed physically based algorithms for \nthe processes of hillslope sediment ransport [Anderson, 1994; \nRosenbloom and Anderson, 1994], fluvial sediment ransport \n[Howard, 1994], and bedrock channel incision [Howard et al., \n1994]. As yet, however, no LEM has incorporated realistic \nalgorithms for tectonic displacements or bedrock landsliding. \nWe discuss below why such algorithms are important in gen- \nerate and interpreting mountainous landforms, and our rea- \nsons for applying the completed LEM to mountainous topog- \nraphy in the Basin and Range province of the western United \nStates. \n1.1. Models of Tectonic Displacements \nCoseismic and aseismic tectonic displacements generate \nstructural relief and create the template on which geomorphic \nprocesses act. The degree of realism required in the tectonic \ndisplacement field used by an LEM depends on the desired \nrealism and spatial resolution of the model. Simple wedge- \nshaped [Kooi and Beaumont, 1996], sinusoidal [Tucker and \nSlingerland, 1996], or Gaussian [Anderson, 1994] uplift patterns \nmay be sufficient o simulate orogenic-scale t ctonic displace- \nments. At higher resolutions, permanent ectonic displacement \nfields generally display significant structure at length scales of \na few kilometers [e.g., King et al., 1988; Stein et al., 1988]. If \n15,203 \n15,204 DENSMORE ET AL.: EVOLUTION OF MOUNTAINOUS TOPOGRAPHY \ntopography is generated by repeated applications of that dis- \nplacement field, simulating the effects of multiple earthquakes \non a particular set of faults, then a high-resolution LEM must \ninclude a tectonic function that accurately reproduces struc- \nture in the displacement field at those length scales. \n1.2. Models of Bedrock Landsliding \nBedrock landsliding has been shown to be a significant geo- \nmorphic process in a variety of landscapes [Kelsey, 1980, 1988; \nPearce and Watson, 1986; Schmidt and Montgomery, 1995; \nBlodgett et al., 1996; Burbank et al., 1996; Densmore t al., 1997; \nHovius et al., 1997]. Blodgett et al. [1996] calculated short-term \nerosion rates due to landsliding of 10-14 mm yr -\u2022 in the \nBolivian Andes, while Hovius et al. [1997] derived erosion rates \nof 5-12 mm yr -\u2022 in the Southern Alps of New Zealand. De- \nspite these observations the long-term role of bedrock land- \nslides in landscape evolution is poorly understood, and no \nLEM has yet incorporated a realistic bedrock landsliding \nmechanism. Existing LEMs treat hillslope processes either as \ndiffusive [e.g., Kooi and Beaumont, 1994, 1996], or as a \"buzz \nsaw\" that instantaneously lowers unstable slopes [Howard, \n1994; Tucker and Slingerland, 1994]. Anderson [1994] argued \nthat bedrock landslides are necessary to produce the linear \nhillslopes often observed in real landscapes, and simulated the \nlandslide process with a hillslope sediment flux that increased \nsharply as a critical slope angle was approached. These ap- \nproaches have been shown to produce realistic-looking land- \nscapes and may be sufficient if the modeling goal is simply to \nreproduce the gross shape o \u2022 ,h\u2022., ....... h,, However, they t L.,\u2022 L\u2022,la\u2022,\u2022l,Xlally. \nare ultimately limited by their reliance on parameters that have \nno physical meaning: a \"landscape-scale\" diffusivity in the case \nof the diffusion model, and a critical slope threshold in the case \nof the buzz saw model. In addition, such deterministic models \nignore the potentially important and time-dependent role \nplayed by large bedrock landslides in landscape volution. For \nexample, large landslides may form natural dams whose cre- \nation and eventual failure have drastic impacts on the down- \nstream geomorphology of the river system [Costa and Schuster, \n1988]. The size of the landslide dam determines both how long \nit persists and how large the eventual outburst flood is, which \nin turn determine the amount of geomorphic change effected \nby the presence of the dam [Costa and O'Connor, 1995]. Fi- \nnally, such deterministic models cannot be used in testing fre- \nquency-magnitude distributions of landslides, despite the fact \nthat these distributions provide a distinctive fingerprint of \nmountainous regions and are increasingly easy to acquire \nthrough remote sensing [e.g., Hovius et al., 1997]. \nA variety of studies have addressed either the short-term \nbehavior of bedrock landslides or their spatial and temporal \ndistribution. Selby [1980] recognized the importance of discon- \ntinuities in controlling and material properties of bedrock and \ndevised a landscape-scale bedrock strength index. Kirkby \n[1987] produced one-dimensional numerical models of hill- \nslope evolution by landsliding using a steady state reaction \nmodel. Schmidt and Montgomery [1995] used the observed re- \nlief in landslide-dominated regions to infer landscape-scale \nbedrock strength, and Miller and Dunne [1996] predicted the \ntwo-dimensional density of fracturing within bedrock hill- \nslopes. Compilations of spatial landslide distributions have \ngenerally been limited to small spatial and temporal scales \n[e.g., Megahan et al., 1978; Noever, 1993], although a number of \nrecent studies have used remote-sensing techniques to deter- \nmine landscape-scale landslide scaling laws and erosion rates \n[Pearce and Watson, 1986; Blodgett et al., 1996; Hovius et al., \n1997]. \n1.3. Application to the Basin and Range Province \nThe primary motivation behind the development of our \nLEM is to explore the evolution of mountainous topography in \nthe Basin and Range province as a function of both surface and \ntectonic processes. The dramatic ranges of the Basin and \nRange are consequences of late Cenozoic extension and have \ninspired eloquent explanations for the origin of mountains in \ngeneral. The structure of these ranges is due to time-integrated \ntectonic displacements, and consequently, their structural ge- \nology has received the most attention in resolving issues about \ntheir origin. In contrast, their topography has received little \nattention since the turn of the century [Gilbert, 1928] (see \nSharp [1939, 1940] and Wallace [1978] for notable exceptions). \nThis is partly because mountainous topography is often con- \nsidered the remnant of the more active process of geological \nmountain building, the insignificant remains of the day. Even \nwhen topography is acknowledged to contain valuable tectonic \ninformation, it is recognized that this information is convolved \nwith the effects of surface processes. We show that despite this, \nthe topography of actively forming mountains may yield quan- \ntitative insights into both sets of processes. \nIn this paper, we describe a numeric landscale evolution \nmodel and demonstrate the role of bedrock landsliding in the \nevolution of synthetic landscapes at length scales of 102-104 m. \nSince this is, to our knowledge, the first LEM to incorporate a \nCtAIOg, lk lCtll\u20221311\u2022llllg l HIC\u2022 WC \u00bd\u2022Ulllpi:11C UHI 111ULII\u2022I pll\u2022LlllJtlUllb UI \ntopography, landslide erosion rates, and landslide distribution \nwith existing field data from active-fault-bounded mountains in \nthe Basin and Range. \n2. The Landscape Evolution Model: ZSCAPE \nZSCAPE is a three-dimensional numerical model that acts \non a finite-difference grid [Ellis et al., 1995]. We use a 100-m \nspacing between grid points as a compromise between spatial \nresolution and computation time. This is comparable to the \nresolution of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 3-arcsec dig- \nital elevation models (DEMs), and we test our numerical and- \nscapes against those digital data. The model processes can be \ndivided into two distinct groups: a tectonic rule set, which \ngenerates a bedrock displacement field, and a geomorphic rule \nset, which attacks the resulting bedrock topography and rear- \nranges mass at the surface. \n3. Tectonic Rule Set \nCurrent LEMs use a kinematic tectonic forcing function that \nprescribes a relatively simple pattern of uplift assumed to be \nappropriate at the temporal and length scale of interest. In \nmost cases, these LEMs have been aimed at very long-term \n(--> 106 years) and long length scale (-> 105 m) orogens in which \nthe details of tectonic displacements due to upper crustal fault- \ning are likely to be irrelevant. Our level of interest, however, is \nat the mountain range scale and below, which requires a more \nrealistic tectonic displacement function. \nWe assume that patterns of deformation are derived primar- \nily from the sum of repeated earthquakes across faults within \nthe upper crust [Stein et al., 1988; King et al., 1988], and we \nassume that such displacement fields may be derived from \nplanar dislocations within an isotropic elastic half-space. A \nDENSMORE ET AL.: EVOLUTION OF MOUNTAINOUS TOPOGRAPHY 15,205 \n(cm)' '0 \nUplift 400\u2022 \nFigure 1. Tectonic displacement field used in the model experiments, corresponding to a single earthquake \n(Mw '\" 7.0). The fault is driven by a pure shear, extensional displacement gradient tensor (shown schemat- \nically by the large arrows) at a strain rate of -\"10 -7 yr -\u2022. Note that the fault extends along strike beyond the \nedges of the 20 by 20 km displacement field. The ZSCAPE experiments use only the central 10 by 10 km region \nof the displacement field shown here. The inset shows a cross section through the center of the displacement \nfield, as well as the 45\u00f8-dipping fault plane. \nnumber of studies have demonstrated that simple elastic dis- \nlocation models reproduce at least the first-order features of \nreal tectonic displacement fields from a variety of geologic \nsettings [e.g., Stein et al., 1988; Massonnet et al., 1993; Gomberg \nand Ellis, 1994; Anderson and Menking, 1994]. \nWe calculate displacements using the three-dimensional \nboundary-element algorithm of Gomberg and Ellis [1993, \n1994], based on the three-dimensional Green's function of \nOkada [1992]. The boundary element method [Crouch and \nStarfield, 1983] provides analytical solutions for displacements \nwithin a material that is subject to internal displacements \nacross one or more planar dislocation elements. Solutions are \nobtained by minimizing strain energy within the material while \nsatisfying stress, strain, or displacement boundary conditions. \nThe Gomberg-Ellis algorithm allows in addition the specifica- \ntion of a remote or far-field boundary condition that provides \nthe driving force for displacements across model faults that are \nconstrained by stress conditions. \nIn the present experiments, we drive displacements across \nnormal faults by specifying a regional pure shear in which crust \nis horizontally extended at twice the magnitude that it is \nthinned vertically and shortened horizontally. For a 45 \u00f8- \ndipping fault of 40-km length and 15-km width (downdip), this \nincrement of pure shear yields displacements that correspond \nto an earthquake of moment magnitude 7.0 (Figure 1). We \nrepeat these earthquakes at 500 year intervals, which corre- \nsponds to a strain-rate of 10 -7 yr -\u2022 over a length of 100 km. \nThese figures are within an order of magnitude of current \nestimates of strain across the Basin and Range province [Sav- \nage et al., 1995; Dixon et al., 1995]. \nSurface displacements due to the model earthquake range \nfrom 140 cm of subsidence to 30 cm of uplift. We neglect \nsecond-order displacements due to postseismic processes that \nresult from the viscous relaxation of stresses in lower crustal \nmaterial. At present, the model does not allow for flexural \nisostatic elevation changes that result from differential loading \nand unloading. These changes have been shown to be signifi- \ncant in extensional settings [e.g., Weissel and Karner, 1989; King \nand Ellis, 1990; Small and Anderson, 1995]. We demonstrate \nbelow, however, that the differential flexural change in eleva- \ntion across our 10 by 10 km model space is small for geologi- \ncally reasonable values of crustal elastic thickness. Flexurally \nderived tilting, which could potentially influence the geomor- \nphic evolution of the model space, is thus relatively unimpor- \ntant. \nThe accumulation of tectonic deformation importantly in- \nvolves both horizontal and vertical displacements. Many three- \ndimensional LEMs incorporate only vertical displacements, \nbut we employ the full three-dimensional field. We use an \nEulerian description of the deformation that amounts to \nwatching material move through the fixed finite-difference \ngrid. \n4. Geomorphic Rule Set \nErosion and deposition within the model are dictated by \nconservation of mass, which relates the rate of change of the \nsurface elevation to spatial gradients in sediment flux: \noz\/Ot = (l\/p) V-qs (1) \nHere Oz\/Ot is the rate of elevation change with time, p is the \nbulk density of the material in question, and q s is the mass \nsediment ransport rate per unit width. (These and other sym- \nbols are depicted in the notation section.) In determining nu- \nmerical expressions for qs, most surface processes models have \ndistinguished between hillslope and fluvial sediment ransport \nprocesses [Anderson, 1994; Howard, 1994; Tucker and Slinger- \nland, 1994; Kooi and Beaumont, 1996]. We take a similar ap- \nproach, identifying four key geomorphic processes active in the \nBasin and Range: regolith production, regolith transport, bed- \nrock landsliding, and fluvial sediment ransport. The first three \nprocesses occur on hillslopes, while the last is confined to the \nfluvial channel system. To accommodate this basic dichotomy, \nwe divide the landscape into hillslope and channel nodes and \napply the appropriate algorithms to each set of nodes. While \nwe recognize that valley glaciers have been important geomor- \nphic agents in parts of the highest ranges of the Basin and \nRange [e.g., Stewart, 1980], we ignore their effects in our cur- \nrent experiments. \n15,206 DENSMORE ET AL.: EVOLUTION OF MOUNTAINOUS TOPOGRAPHY \nHillslopes \n.

Schematic diagram of the tectonic and geomorphic \ncomponents of the ZSCAPE rule set. Topography is produced \nby faulting in response to an applied displacement gradient \ntensor. Regolith is produced at all nodes in the model space \nand is transported via a linear diffusion law that accounts for \nshallow mass movements. Bedrock landsliding is controlled by \na stochastic law that depends upon the maximum stable hill- \nslope height, which in turn is determined by the rock cohesion \nand friction angle. Channel nodes are defined on the basis of \nexcess stream power, which also dictates the rate of alluvial \nsediment transport and the rate of bedrock incision. \nBecause of constraints on computation time, LEMs in gen- \neral are incapable of resolving the effects of geomorphic pro- \ncesses below some cutoff length scale. The magnitude of this \nlength scale depends on the particular numerical algorithm \nused to represent the process in question. ZSCAPE is not \nimmune to this cutoff, but we have tried to represent the key \ngeomorphic processes with algorithms that allow us to extend \nthe cutoff down to length scales of the order of 100 m. In this \nway we are able to examine the landscape at the scale of \nindividual landforms. Our experiments are not intended to \nreproduce the fine-scale details of the topography, such as the \ndetailed morphology of a stream bed or the effect of jointing \non an individual bedrock landslide [Weissel and Seidl, 1997]. \nRather, they are designed to bridge the gap between orogenic- \nscale simulations, in which geomorphic processes are only \ncrudely represented, and landform-scale analyses, which ig- \nnore the larger spatial and temporal framework. \n4.1. Regolith Production \nSediment transport requires the presence of a mobile layer \nof regolith, distinct from the bedrock. The regolith thickness is \ndefined as the difference between the surface and bedrock \nelevations. Regolith is produced by in situ weathering of bed- \nrock, which lowers the bedrock surface elevation and increases \nthe regolith thickness. Since weathering processes are partly \ndependent on the presence of water at the bedrock surface for \nsignificant periods of time, peak regolith production rates have \nbeen hypothesized to occur beneath some finite thickness of \nregolith, rather than on bare bedrock [Ahnert, 1970]. Recent \nstudies using cosmogenic radionuclide concentrations have \nconfirmed that weathering is faster beneath regolith than on \nbare bedrock [Small and Anderson, 1996] and that regolith \nproduction rates decline rapidly beneath thicker regolith [He- \nimsath et al., 1996]. The exact dependence of the production \nrate curve on regolith thickness is poorly known. \nWe adopt a linear increase in regolith production rate, OR\/ \nO t, up to a regolith thickness R,, beyond which the rate de- \nclines exponentially (Figure 2): \nOR (OR)[ (OR\/Ot)* - ( R\/Ot)\u00f8] o (2) \nO _< R _< R, \n--= exp R > R (3) 0t \u2022 , Rscale * \nHere R is the regolith thickness, (0R\/0t)o is the bare bedrock \nregolith production rate, (0R\/0t), is the maximum production \nrate at thickness R ,, and Rscal cis the exponential decay length \nscale (Table 1). Regolith production rates on bare bedrock in \nthe western United States, determined by cosmogenic radio- \nnuclide concentrations, are typically 10-50 x 10 -6 m yr -1 \n[e.g., Bierman, 1994; Small and Anderson, 1996]. \n4.2. Regolith Transport \nHillslope transport of regolith typically occurs by processes \nsuch as creep, slope wash, rain splash, and downslope motion \ndue to animal activity [Selby, 1993]. Since the transport rates \nproduced by these processes are slope-dependent, we model \nregolith transport as a linear diffusive process (Figure 2): \nqs- -kV .z (4) \nwhere k is a diffusion coefficient. Combining equations (1) and \n(2) yields a diffusion equation for topography: \nOz\/Ot = \u2022:V2z (5) \nHere Oz\/Ot is the rate of change of the surface elevation and K \nis the topographic diffusivity (equivalent o k\/p). Typical land- \nform-scale diffusivities calculated for semiarid to arid land- \nscapes in the western United States are 0.01 m 2 yr-i [Hanks et \nal., 1984; Rosenbloom and Anderson, 1994]. While some LEMs \nhave used diffusional algorithms, with dramatically greater dif- \nfusivities, to produce realistic-looking topography [Koons, \n1989; Kooi and Beaumont, 1994], we note again that diffusion \nis properly applied only to transport-limited processes [Ander- \nTable 1.

To \naddress this, we follow Anderson [1994] in simulating regolith \nmass movement by allowing the sediment transport rate qs to \nincrease exponentially as a critical topographic slope \/\u2022cr\u2022t is \napproached (Figure 2; Table 1). While this is an approximate \nsolution, we show below that rates of weathering-limited pro- \ncesses such as diffusion are dwarfed by rates of fluvial and \nlandsliding processes in the arid landscapes in which we are \ninterested. \n4.3. Fluvial Sediment Transport \nWe distinguish between alluvial and bedrock channel behav- \nior depending on the availability of mobile material within the \nchannel. Potential fluvial sediment transport flux is assumed to \nbe proportional to the available stream power per unit bed \narea, 12 [Bagnold, 1977], approximated here as \n\u2022\/APCrS \n12: (6) \nw \nwhere 3\/is the flow unit weight, A is the contributing drainage \narea, P is the precipitation rate, Cr is the runoff coefficient, S \nis the channel bed slope, and w is the flow width (Table 1). The \nprecipitation rate is set to 1 m yr -\u2022 and is both spatially and \ntemporally constant in these experiments (Table 1). Since our \ngrid spacing (100 m) is much greater than typical flow widths, \nwe use an empirical relation between flow width and contrib- \nuting drainage area, \n(?) \nwhere kw is the empirically determined constant (Table 1). \nThe channel network is defined as the set of nodes for which \n12 >- 12o, where 12o is the threshold stream power necessary for \nchannel initiation [BagnoM, 1977]. We follow BagnoM [1977] in \nrelating alluvial sediment transport flux to excess stream pow- \ner: \nQs = ka' (12 - 120) (8) \nwhere Qs is the potential volumetric sediment transport rate \nper unit bed width and k a is an empirical proportionality con- \nstant (Figure 2; Table 1). Spatial gradients in sediment trans- \nport dictate the rate of change of the bed elevation, as given by \nequation (1). Any excess tream power, defined as the available \npower beyond that required to transport all sediment in a \nparticular node, erodes the bedrock channel bed [e.g., Seidl \nand Dietrich, 1992] at a rate given by \nOzb \nOt = k6' 12 ...... (9) \nwhere k\u2022, is an empirical proportionality constant and 12 ...... is \nthe excess tream power (Figure 2; Table 1). \nThe behavior of alluvial and bedrock channels in our model \nis thus prescribed primarily by the empirical parameters k a, \nk\u2022,, and 12o. While some effort has gone toward general char- \nacterizations of these parameters [e.g., BagnoM, 1977; Rosen- \nbloom and Anderson, 1994; Stock and Montgomery, 1995], dif- \nferences in the algorithms used by different workers make such \ngeneralization difficult. We have chosen parameter values by \nletting ZSCAPE operate on DEM representations of real to- \npography from several mountain ranges in the Basin and \nRange. We thus generate synthetic channel networks whose \nspatial extent depends on 12o and whose rates of sediment \ntransport and bed incision depend upon k, and k t,. By com- \nparing these results with observed channel networks and typ- \nical transport and incision rates, we can determine reasonable \nvalues of these parameters. Sensitivity tests demonstrate that \nour experimental results cannot discriminate between values \nthat differ by less than an order of magnitude. \nFinally, we note that our chosen precipitation rate (1.0 m \nyr -\u2022) is considerably higher than measured historical rates \nfrom the Basin and Range (typically <0.5 m yr-l). Precipita- \ntion rates during the last glacial maximum are estimated to be \n30-100% higher than present, although there is considerable \ndisagreement over the magnitude of the change [SpauMing, \n1985]. We stress that our chosen value is somewhat arbitrary, \nsince precipitation is linearly related to sediment transport and \nbed incision through the empirical parameters k a and k\u2022,, \nwhich are chosen on the basis of landscape form. While abso- \nlute values of precipitation are relatively unimportant from this \nperspective, relative temporal changes in precipitation may \nplay an important role in landscape evolution; we do not ex- \nplore this issue here. \n4.4. Bedrock Landsliding \nThe final geomorphic component of the model is a bedrock \nlandsliding algorithm, which determines the distribution of \nlandslides in both space and time. In natural settings, landslide \noccurrence is strongly stochastic, and we argue that a realistic \nalgorithm must reflect this stochastic character. Discrete bed- \nrock landslides deliver large and highly spatially variable \namounts of sediment to the channel network, affecting the \npattern of erosion and deposition within the channel and thus \nits geomorphic evolution. The frequency and magnitude of the \nlandslide events control this evolution [Wolman and Miller, \n1960], as does the sequence in which the events occur \n[Densmore t al., 1997]. Accurate simulation of the landscape \nrequires a representation of the landslide process that captures \nthe essence ofthe observed long-term behavi6r. \nA bedrock landsliding algorithm must address four central \nissues: where landslides begin, when they occur, how large they \narea, and where the landslide material ends up after failure. \nWe use the terms bedrock landslide and landslide interchange- \nably to denote a mass movement that involves intact or un- \nweathered bedrock rather than being confined to a mobile \nregolith layer. \nIn the absence of strong tectonic and climatic variations, \nlandslides in natural settings are concentrated on hillslopes \nthat experience a fall in local base level. This base level drop \nmay be due to vertical motion across a fault, to the occurrence \nof a separate landslide lower on the hillslope [Densmore t al., \n1997], or to incision by a glacier [Harbor, 1992] or stream \n[Megahan et al., 1978; Kelsey, 1980, 1988; Seidl et al., 1996; \nDensmore et al., 1997]. Landslides are often observed to cluster \nnear the toes of hillslopes [Megahan et al., 1978; Kelsey, 1988; \nDensmore et al., 1997]. Megahan et al. [1978] found that most \nlandslides in the Northern Rocky Mountain physiographic \nprovince occurred on the lower one third of the hillslope. \nKelsey [1988] found that most landslides along Redwood \nCreek, California, initiated at the base of the slope, leading to \nthe formation of a steep toe or inner gorge along the channel. \nDensmore et al. [1997] observed that all slides on a granular \nmodel hillslope initiated at the toe and that 90% involved only \n15,208 DENSMORE ET AL.: EVOLUTION OF MOUNTAINOUS TOPOGRAPHY \nFigure 3. Topography from the Humboldt Range, Nevada, \nfrom USGS 3-arcsec DEM data, and the synthetic channel \nnetwork generated on that topography by ZSCAPE. Nodes \ndesignated as channels by ZSCAPE are shown in black. The \nextent and interconnectedness of the channel network are di- \nrectly dependent on the threshold channel power \u2022o used in \nthe experiment (Table 1). \na portion of the hillslope. This resulted in a commonly ob- \nserved inner gorge that was removed only by the largest slides. \nWe therefore select potential sites of landslide initiation, or \ntargets, as the lowest points on each hillslope whose topo- \ngraphic gradient exceeds a critical material friction angle 4) \n(Figure 3). This ensures that landslides begin near the toe of \nhillslopes and that they initiate only on hillslopes that are steep \nenough to promote failure. \nHillslope failure may be caused by a number of events, \nincluding intense precipitation or coseismic shaking, weather- \ning and subsequent weakening of planes within the rock mass, \nor a fall in local base level. Here we simply consider landslides \ncaused by base level fall. We expect that as base level falls, the \nhillslope toe will become steeper and less buttressed, and thus \nmore likely to fail. To assess the local potential for failure, we \nemploy the Culmann slope stability criterion [Spantier and \nHandy, 1982], which holds that the maximum stable height that \na hillslope may attain will be reached when the shear stress on \na potential failure plane within the hillslope is balanced by the \nshear strength on that plane. In terms of forces, the effective \nweight of the hillslope material is \nFeff= Fw sin 0 (10) \nwhere F,\u2022 is the weight of the hillslope material and 0 is the dip \nof the potential failure plane. The balancing shear resistance is \ngiven by \nF r '-- CL + Fw cos 0 tan qb (11) \nwhere C is the effective cohesion on the plane, L is the length \nof the failure plane, and 4) is the effective friction angle on the \nplane [Spantier and Handy, 1982]. At the edge of stability, \nFef f = Fr, and failure will occur at a critical angle Oc that \nmaximizes the effective cohesion on the failure plane, which \nmay be expressed as \n1 sin (\/3- 0) sin (0 - \nC = \u2022 pgH sin (\/3) cos (qb) (12) \nwhere p is rock density, # is gravitational acceleration, \/3 is \nsurface slope, and H is the hillslope height. The derivative of C \nwith respect to 0 is \n0C i sin (\/3 - 20 + \nO0 = 7pgH sin (\/3) cos (qb) (13) \nso that C is maximized at O c = 1\/2 (\/3 + qb). Substituting 0c \nin (12) and solving for H provides the maximum stable height \nof the hillslope Hc: \n4C sin\/3 cos qb \nHc = (14) pg [ - cos (t3 - 4,)] \nSince by definition the hillslope height H is always less than or \nequal to Hc, we can calculate a probability of failure \nH \nPfail- Hc (15) \nthat varies between 0 and 1 (Figure 4). We take the true failure \nprobability to be the base probability plus a term that increases \nlinearly through time at a rate dictated by the time since the \nlast landslide at that node. This crudely accounts for time- \ndependent weakening of the failure plane and rock mass. \nThe potential size of a bedrock landslide is a function of \nlocal topography and relief, topographic gradient, rock \nstrength, and the distribution, orientation, and strength of po- \ntential failure planes. We again employ the Culmann criterion, \nwhich predicts that the most likely failure plane is one that \npasses through the toe of the slope and dips at O c. \nA potential failure plane, dipping at Oc, is assumed to day- \nlight at every potential andslide target (Figure 4). We project \nthat failure plane outward and upward to all neighboring nodes \nwithin a specified istance from the target. The latter condition \nprevents, for example, nodes on the other side of a stream \nchannel from failing. Those nodes whose surface elevation is \nabove the projected failure plane are considered unstable, and \nthe volume of material between the surface and the failure \nplane is recorded. The maximum potential landslide size at \neach target is the sum of the volumes at all unstable nodes \nassociated with that target. \nDuring each time step, the failure probability at each land- \nFigure 4.

A landslide target (marked \"T\") is assigned as the \nlowest point above the channel (marked \"C\") at which\/3 > 4). \nThe potential failure plane dips at 0 and is assumed to be \nexposed at the target. The probability of failure is given by the \nratio of the local hillslope height H to the maximum stable \nhillslope height Hc, which in turn depends upon the rock \nstrength and the topographic gradient (inset). \nDENSMORE ET AL.: EVOLUTION OF MOUNTAINOUS TOPOGRAPHY 15,209 \nElevation (m) \n_ \n-500 - \n- 1000 - \n-5oo \nFigure 5.

All plots in this and subsequent plates are 10 km by 10 km, and vertical exaggeration is 2x. \nslide target is compared with a uniform deviate. If the uniform \ndeviate is smaller than the failure probability, a landslide ini- \ntiates at that node. The size of the landslide is directly propor- \ntional to the time since the last landslide at that node. This is \nmotivated by the observation that the size of slides in a physical \nhillslope model is primarily a function of the time since the last \nevent [Densmore t al., 1997]. The size is limited by the maxi- \nmum potential size determined above. \nAfter failure, the depositional pattern of the failed material \ndepends strongly on both its rheology and the topography of \nthe runout path. Thus a rockfall behaving as a Coulomb ma- \nterial may form a steep talus, while a more fluid, viscous debris \nflow may form a deposit with a much lower surface slope and \nconsiderably longer runout. The present algorithm spreads the \nresulting volume of material down the path of steepest descent \nas a deposit three nodes wide. We specify both the longitudinal \n(2 \u00f8 ) and the lateral (5 \u00f8 ) surface slopes of the deposit, which \nresults in a debris flowlike tongue of failed material. The ma- \nterial is deposited as regolith, meaning it may subsequently be \nremobilized by other geomorphic processes. \n5. Experimental Results \nWe first describe the synthetic landscapes generated by \nZSCAPE, both with and without the bedrock landsliding rule \nenabled, and compare those landscapes with selected examples \nof mountainous topography from the Basin and Range prov- \nince using simple statistical measures. We quantify the role of \nbedrock landslides by examining the model erosion rates due \nto different geomorphic processes. We then explore the re- \nsponses of both the hillslope and fluvial systems to changes in \ntectonic activity and precipitation. Finally, we examine the \nspatial and temporal distribution of landslides predicted by \nZSCAPE and compare them with distributions from real land- \nscapes. . \nWe compare our results with topography from ranges that \nare bounded by active normal faults and that show clear signs \nof tectonic activity, such as linear range fronts, triangular fac- \nets, and piedmont fault scarps [Wallace, 1978]. On the basis of \nour field observations and the work of Stewart [1980] and \nWallace [1978], among others, we identify five ranges in par- \nticular that meet our criteria: the Humboldt, Stillwater, Tobin, \nand Toiyabe Ranges in Nevada, and Steens Mountain in Or- \negon. We emphasize that while our synthetic landscapes are \ncompared below with specific ranges, the visual and statistical \nsignatures of these ranges are very similar despite their widely \ndisparate tectonic and lithologic histories. We draw compari- \nsons with a variety of ranges in order to highlight the consistent \nform taken by these active-fault-bounded mountains. \nIt is worth noting that the few existing data on landslide \noccurrence and magnitude-frequency distributions come from \nhigh-relief regions with high tectonic deformation rates, such \nas the Andes [Blodgett et al., 1996] and the Southern Alps of \nNew Zealand [Hovius et al., 1997]. No such data have been \ncollected for mountains of the Basin and Range. We therefore \nrely on the topography of these ranges, which after all is due to \nthe integrated effect of geomorphic and tectonic processes, to \nconstrain our present set of experiments. \n5.1. Synthetic and Real Landscapes \nIn experiment 1 we begin with a gently tilted (1 \u00f8) initial \nsurface on which there is up to 5 m of randomly distributed \nbedrock topography, and up to 1 m of randomly distributed \nregolith (Figure 5a). We track the topography through 1000 \n15,210 DENSMORE ET AL.: EVOLUTION OF MOUNTAINOUS TOPOGRAPHY \nElevation (m) \n500 - \n0 \n-500 - \n- 1000 - \n-1500 - \nElevation (m) \nFigure 5.

The resulting landscape (Figures 5b and 5c) \nappears remarkably similar to topography from many normal- \nfault-bounded mountain ranges, such as the Stillwater and \nToiyabe Ranges in Nevada (Figure 6). The landscape contains \na number of characteristic landforms that are observed along \nactive normal-fault-bounded ranges [Wallace, 1978]. Catch- \nments within the mountain mass generally are short and steep \nand trend normal to the mountain front. The catchments are \nshaped somewhat like a wineglass, with a large collection area \nDENSMORE ET AL.: EVOLUTION OF MOUNTAINOUb t OPOGRAPHY 15,211 \nElevation (m) \n2500 - \n2000 - \n1500 - \n1000 - \nElevation (m) \n3000 - \n2500 - \n1500 - \n1000 - \nFigure 6.

Finally, material \nremoved from the catchments is deposited very close to the \nmountain front within a hanging-wall basin. These deposits, \nwhich are fanlike at first, eventually coalesce to form a bajada \non the hanging-wall block. \nThe role of landsliding in the evolution of these mountain \n-lOOO - \n-500 - \n..\u2022 \n-1500 - \u2022, \nFigure 7.

In experiment 2 the hill- \nslopes evolve only by regolith production and linear diffusion, \nand the catchments are unable to widen significantly. This \nresults in considerably steeper hillslopes and a much higher \ndrainage density than in experiment 1 (Figure 7). Drainage \ndensity, relief, and mean slope along a representative cross \nsection across the footwall block of the Humboldt Range, \nNevada, are far better reproduced by experiment 1 than by \nexperiment 2 (Figure 8). \nThe probability distributions of elevation and of topographic \nslope indicate that experiment 1 is a better approximation of \nreal topography than is experiment 2 (Figure 9). Distributions \nfrom the Tobin and Toiyabe Ranges, as well as from Steens \nMountain in Oregon, appear remarkably consistent, despite \nwide variations in lithology and fault activity (Figure 9), indi- \ncating that the distributions are relatively insensitive to these \nparameters. Experiment 1 yields probability distributions of \nelevation and slope that are similar to those of the ranges. In \ncontrast, experiment 2 yields very different distributions, which \nimplies that weathering-limited diffusion alone is unable to \nstatistically reproduce Basin and Range topography. As was \nstated above, other workers have circumvented this by folding \nmass movements into a transport-limited diffusion law and by \nresorting to artificially high values of diffusivity. We show be- \nlow that by treating bedrock landsliding as a separate process, \nwe gain additional insights into the effects of landsliding on \ntopography. \n5.2.

These are due to an abundance of high, slowly diffusing \ninterfluves and very steep catchment walls, respectively. \nA \n\u2022 0 \nDistance (km) \nB 2200 \n16000' ' k' ' '4 \u2022 8 \nDistance (kin) \nc 200 \n-6000 2 4 6 8 \nDistance (km) \nFigure 8.

Vertical exaggeration is 5x for each \nprofile. \nnumber of landslides in experiment 1 occur on the faceted \nspurs adjacent to the fault, and on the relatively long-lived \nhillslopes adjacent to the major channels (Plate 1). Hillslopes \nin the upper parts of the catchments, only recently excavated \nby channel incision, experience comparatively few landslides. \nAn important corollary of this observation is that triangular \nfacets are highly modified and shaped by geomorphic pro- \ncesses, and are therefore generally not simply exhumed rem- \nnants of the original fault surface. \nIn experiment 1, bedrock landsliding is the dominant ero- \nsional process on the footwall block, except within the bottoms \nof stream valleys (Figure 10). Initial sculpting of the footwall is \nby fluvial incision, which sets the conditions for subsequent \nhillslope development by landsliding. The efficient delivery of \nsediment to the valleys by landsliding causes continual change \nin the channel network, as channels migrate and adjust to the \nchanging sediment load and slope distribution. This migration \nis manifested as relatively broad zones within the valleys in \nwhich fluvial erosion is the dominant process (Figure 10). Flu- \nvial and bedrock landsliding processes yield long-term (1000 \nkyr), spatially and temporally averaged erosion rates of 0.8 and \n0.5 mm yr -\u2022, respectively (Figure 11). In contrast, he mean \nrate of relief generation across the fault, given by the sum of \nthe mean rates of uplift and subsidence, is 0.9 mm yr-\u2022.

Kelsey \n[1980] documented sediment fluxes consistent with a spatially \naveraged erosion rate of ---1 mm yr-' in the Van Duzen River \nbasin of northern California. He also found that debris slides in \ncompetent bedrock supplied a significant fraction of sediment \nto the channel system. Blodgett et al. [1996] inferred landslide \nerosion rates of 10-14 mm yr-\u2022 in the Bolivian Andes, signif- \nicantly higher than long-term fission track denudation rates of \n0.7-2.8 mm yr -\u2022. Hovius et al. [1997] calculated landslide ro- \nsion rates, averaged over 38 years, of 5-12 mm yr -1 in catch- \nments on South Island, New Zealand; these are rates consis- \ntent with measured fluvial sediment fluxes. \n5.3. Landscape Response Time \nContinuous landscape activity requires that the local hill- \nslope base level be consistently lowered. In our experiments \nthis is accomplished by (1) continued activity on the fault, \nwhich lowers both global base level for channels draining the \nfootwall and local base level for hillslopes along the mountain \nfront, and (2) continued precipitation, which provides the \nchannels with enough stream power to incise. We can assess \nthe importance of these factors in landslide generation by \nabruptly changing one or both during a model run. In experi- \nment 3, precipitation is held'constant at 1.0 m yr-1 throughout \nthe run, but activity on the fault stops at 1100 kyr of model run \ntime (Figure 12). The number of landslides per time step \ndecays rapidly, reaching 90% of the new mean in ---100 kyr \n(Figure 12). \nThis 100-kyr response time may be thought of as a convo- \nlution of two components: a fluvial component, during which \nchannel incision is progressively replaced by aggradation \nthroughout the network, and a hillslope component, during \nwhich landslides occur on unstable but previously unfailed \nhillslopes. The relative importance of these components may \nbe estimated by comparing experiment 3 with experiment 4, in \nwhich precipitation is lowered by an order of magnitude to \n0.1 m yr -1, simultaneous with the cessation of fault activity. \nThe landscape response time should thus reflect only the in- \nfluence of the hillslope component, since all channel incision \neffectively ceases immediately. In fact, the number of land- \nslides immediately decreases to ---0 per time step (Figure 12), \nindicating that the hillslope response time is extremely rapid \ncompared with the fluvial response time. Thus, relative to the \nchannels, the hillslopes rapidly achieve a steady state, as was \nassumed by Anderson [1994]. \n5.4. Landslide Statistics \nLandslides in our experiments show significant variation in \nsize with time (Figure 13a). The probability distribution of \nlandslide size may be approximated by a power law, a behavior \nthat is observed in laboratory landslide experiments [e.g., \nGrumbacher et al., 1993; Frette et al., 1996] as well as in natural \nsettings [Noever, 1993; Blodgett et al., 1996; Hovius et al., 1997]. \nFor experiment 1 we calculate a power law exponent of -2.2, \nvery similar to the exponents often observed in laboratory \nexperiments (Figure 13c) [Frette et al., 1996]. In contrast, the \nfew measured natural landslide distributions have yielded \npower law exponents of approximately -1.3 (Figure 13c) \n[Blodgett et al., 1996; Hovius et al., 1997]. One possible reason \nfor this discrepancy lies in the differing spatial resolution of the \nmethods used to observe landslide distributions. For example, \nHovius et al. [1997] use repeat aerial photographs to assess the \nextent of landslides, and claim an areal resolution of 102-106 \n6 l0 s \n\u2022, 5 10 5\n'\u2022 4 10 5\n'\u2022 3 10 5 \n\u2022 2 10 5 \n.1 1 10 5 \n0 \n0 5 10 4 1 105 1.5 105 2 105 \nTime (yr) \no \n;> \n6 10 5 \n5 10 5 \n4 10 5 \nC = 20000 kPa \nphi = 40 \u00f8 \n3 10 5 \n2 10 5 \n1 10 5 \n0 \n0 5 10 4 1 105 1.5 105 \nTime (yr) \n2 10 5 \n100 \n\u2022 10 \n;E 0.1 \nO.Ol \n0.001 \n1000 \nLandslide volume (m 3) \nFigure 13.

The thin solid lines show schematically the exponents \nderived from natural (-1.3 [Blodgett et al., 1996] and -1.2 \n[Hovius et al., 1997]) and laboratory (-2.0 [Frette et al., 1996]) \nlandslide distributions. \n15,216 DENSMORE ET AL.: EVOLUTION OF MOUNTAINOUS TOPOGRAPHY \nm 2. Our algorithm is limited to resolving landslides between \n10 4 and 2.5 x 105 m 2 in area, which means that we may be \nunable to accurately reproduce portions of the landslide size \nspectrum in particular regions. Another potential reason for \nthe difference in power law exponents is that the remote- \nsensing studies of Blodgett et al. [1996] and Hovius et al. [1997] \ncompute landslide magnitude-frequency relations on the basis \nof landslide area, whereas we use landslide volume. Hovius et \nal. [1997] relate area to volume via an empirical function that \nmay well be location-specific and may account for the variation \nin exponents. \nThe bedrock landsliding algorithm is primarily controlled by \nthe rock cohesion and friction angle, which are complex, often \ntime-dependent properties of the rock mass [Selby, 1993]. Val- \nues of these parameters for various rock types, measured both \nin the field and in the laboratory, range over several orders of \nmagnitude [Schmidt and Montgomery, 1995]. Several workers \n[Selby, 1980; Schmidt and Montgomery, 1995] have pointed out \nthat rock mass strength decreases with increasing spatial length \nscale. The appropriate rock strength values in ZSCAPE should \ntherefore reflect the influence of discontinuities within the \nrock mass, rather than laboratory strength measurements. The \nmajority of our experiments use landscape-scale values of co- \nhesion and friction angle, C = 60 kPa and 4> = 20\u00f8 (Santa \nCruz Mountain sedimentary rock of Schmidt and Montgomery \n[1995]). The effect of rock strength on experimental land- \nscapes is illustrated by experiment 5, in which we use values \nmore typical of those measured in the laboratory, C - 20,000 \nkPa and (k = 40\u00f8 (hard sedimentary rock of Schmidt and \nMontgomery [1995]). The higher strength leads to steeper crit- \nical hillslope heights (equation (14)) and thus results in fewer \nand smaller landslides (Figure 13b). In addition, the smaller \nexponent implies that large landslides are relatively more \nabundant than in the low-strength experiments. However, we \nstress that experiments with nearly any degree of landsliding \nresult in topography that is fundamentally different from that \ngenerated by weathering-limited diffusion alone. \n6. Discussion \n6.1. Fluvial Incision as a Rate-Limiting Process \nThe similarity between rates of erosion from fluvial and \nlandslide processes implies that they are tightly coupled. This \ncoupling is a natural consequence of their relative efficiency \nand response times and is not explicitly specified in the model. \nIf landslides in a particular landscape are caused primarily by \nfluvial channel incision, as is modeled here, the degree of \ncoupling will be quite high. However, if other mechanisms of \ndestabilizing slopes, such as groundwater sapping or seismic \naccelerations, are present, we expect the coupling to be much \nless pronounced, as landsliding will occur in response to those \nother mechanisms as well. \nIn our experiments the rate of fluvial channel incision de- \ntermines the rate at which the landscape evolves; the channel \nnetwork sets the lengths and distribution of hillslopes and thus \nis primarily responsible for the gross morphology of the land- \nscape. We argue therefore that field measurements of rates of \nlandscape evolution in setting similar to our experiments \nshould focus on rates of fluvial processes. Nevertheless, the \nstochastic nature of the landsliding process and its intrinsic \nresponse time can yield hillslopes that in essence lag behind \nthe process of local base level lowering. This lag time may yield \nunstable hillslopes uch as inner gorges that exist for relatively \nlong time periods (>--10 3 years). Inner gorges are commonly \nobserved in actively eroding landscapes and may be misinter- \npreted as an indication of a recent increase in incision rate \ncaused by regional base level lowering or climate change \n[Densmore t al., 1997]. \nWeissel and Seidl [1997] have shown that hillslope processes, \nparticularly bedrock mass wasting, limit the headward propa- \ngation rate of drainages on the passive eastern margin of Aus- \ntralia. Their findings do not contradict our conclusions in this \npaper, as they deal with different stages of drainage basin \nevolution. Weissel and Seidl [1997] were concerned with the \ninitial incision of a drainage network into low-relief topogra- \nphy, while our results apply to portions of the drainage net- \nwork that have evolved to a steady state form and relief. \n6.2. System Response as a Measure of Landscape Evolution \nKooi and Beaumont [1996] presented an analysis of land- \nscape response times and the effects of the interaction between \nresponse time and timescales of tectonic forcing. They dem- \nonstrated quasi-linear behavior of their LEM, as evidenced by \nthe exponential response of particular variables to step \nchanges in tectonic forcing. We observe similar quasi-linear \nbehavior in the evolution of our channel network. For exam- \nple, the mean denudation rate on the footwall increases as [1 - \nexp (-t\/t,)] after a step increase in tectonic activity, where \nthe timescale t, \u2022- 200 kyr. \nThe bedrock landsliding algorithm also exhibits a character- \nistic response time after changes in tectonic activity, although \nthe response is highly nonlinear. This is not surprising, given \nthe nonlinear relationship between failure probability and hill- \nslope gradient (equations (14) and (15)). Recall that an abrupt \ncessation of tectonic activity, and thus base level fall, causes a \ndecrease in the number of landslides per time step, with a \nresponse time of the order of 100 kyr (Figure 12). We interpret \nthis response time as reflecting the progressive cessation of \nchannel incision and the onset of aggradation throughout the \nnetwork. An initial wave of aggradation passes very rapidly up \nthe network (on a timescale of <10 kyr, which agrees with the \nobservation of Wallace [1978] in the Basin and Range) and \nresults in the precipitous initial drop in the number of land- \nslides. Aggradation lowers hillslope heights, essentially freez- \ning the failure probability at any particular target. Those hill- \nslopes that are already steep enough to fail, do so eventually, \nand the lack of continued base level fall means that few new \nlandslide-prone hillslopes are created. \n6.3. Assumptions and Improvements \nOur approach to modeling mass movements via landslides \ninvolves two algorithms, one for determining the location and \nsize of a landslide and a second for distributing the failed \nmaterial downslope. The first of these is motivated strongly by \nthe physics and observations of slope failure both in the real \nworked and in controlled experiments, although at present we \nignore most of the range of landslide rheologies [e.g., Varnes, \n1978]. The means of distributing failed material, however, is \ntied less to physics than to basic field observations. This is \npartly because the physics of slide material is strongly depen- \ndent on the rheology of the material. Our simple algorithm to \ndistribute slide material can be tuned by adjusting a limited \nnumber of parameters, but we hasten to point out that these \nparameters are simple proxies for a complicated physical pro- \ncess. Particular applications of the model must at least involve \nDENSMORE ET AL.: EVOLUTION OF MOUNTAINOUS TOPOGRAPHY 15,217 \na landslide rule set that is modified to fit the dominant land- \nslide type observed in the region. \nWe also ignore tectonic and climatic variations as potential \nlandslide triggers. Seismic triggering of landslides is well doc- \numented [Keefer, 1984, 1994], and attempts have been made to \nrelate earthquake magnitude to landslide likelihood [Wilson \nand Keefer, 1985; Jibson and Keefer, 1993]. There is disagree- \nment, however, between theoretical and measured ground ac- \ncelerations during earthquakes, primarily due to topographic \neffects [e.g., Geli et al., 1988], and no general, physically based \nmodel of seismically triggered landsliding has yet been pro- \nposed. \nVariations in climate should affect the bedrock landsliding \nalgorithm in both direct and indirect ways, although we have \nnot yet explored the effect of climate change on landscape \ndevelopment. In particular, we expect that increased precipi- \ntation should increase the channel incision rate and thus more \nrapidly lower the local base level seen by the hillslopes. In \naddition, higher precipitation will increase the rate at which \ninformation on ultimate base level (as dictated, for example, by \ntectonic activity) is transmitted upstream. More rainfall should \nalso increase the regolith production rate and should result in \nsaturation of the hillslope regolith, which would be reflected in \na higher diffusivity and increased mass fluxes by regolith mass \nmovement. Finally, increased precipitation will hasten weath- \nering of the bedrock along joint planes, thereby decreasing the \nbulk cohesion and enabling bedrock landslides. \nWe approximate the accumulating tectonic displacement \nfield by superposing displacement fields calculated from the \ninitial flat surface rather than from the incrementally deform- \ning surface. This leads to\/a progressively larger mismatch be- \ntween the theoretical and applied displacement fields. This is a \nsmall source of error, however, since vertical gradients in the \nrelief across the displacement field are of the order of 2.5 % per \nkilometer of fault displacement. In experiment 1, for instance, \ntotal fault displacement is 3.3 km, implying an error of less \nthan 10%. \nZSCAPE does not yet account for the flexural effects of \ndifferential loading and unloading, which have been shown to \nbe significant in generating footwall uplift in an extensional \nsetting [Weissel and Karner, 1989; King and Ellis, 1990]. We may \nobtain a crude estimate of the magnitude of the elevation \nchanges due to flexure by calculating the displacement in re- \nsponse to the total load accumulated during an experiment. \nThe negative load due to erosion is represented by the differ- \nence between the summed tectonic displacement envelope and \nthe final bedrock topography, while the positive load due to \ndeposition is simply the accumulated regolith thickness. As- \nsuming an effective elastic thickness of 2 km [King and Ellis, \n1990], differential elevation changes due to the flexural re- \nsponse to this load are ---80 m across the 10-km-wide space of \nexperiment 1. In contrast, the cumulative tectonic relief across \nthis same distance in experiment 1 is 620 m. This analysis is of \ncourse approximate, as it ignores the feedback between the \nflexural response and geomorphic activity [King and Ellis, 1990; \nSmall and Anderson, 1995]. \nA final issue concerns the spatial resolution of the geomor- \nphic rule set, particularly of the bedrock landsliding algorithm. \nSelby [1980], among others, helped to quantify the role played \nby joints and fractures in dictating rock strength and slope \nstability. Recent work by Weissel and Seidl [1997] has high- \nlighted the dramatic effect that fracture density and orienta- \ntion have on hillslope morphology. Such fine-scale variables \nare at present ignored by the bedrock landsliding algorithm in \nZSCAPE, being folded into the rock strength parameters. \nHowever, any analysis of the spatially distributed effects of \nfractures on hillslope morphology and landslide occurrence, as \nwell as explicit comparisons between observed and synthetic \nlandslide morphologies, will require an algorithm capable of \nresolving such variables. \nAs such issues are resolved, we believe that models such as \nZSCAPE may eventually be useful in predicting the geomor- \nphic evolution of specific sites. Accurate, high-resolution DEM \ndata will serve as the template on which geomorphic and tec- \ntonic processes act; ZSCAPE is then ideally suited to monitor \nthe evolution of topography, as well as landslide location and \nsize, erosion rates, and sediment fluxes. Such simulations will \nprovide an independent, long-term check on historically mea- \nsured parameters such as catchment sediment fluxes, and may \nhelp to determine whether modern process rate measurements \nagree with long-term equilibria. \n7. Conclusions \nWe have demonstrated the first quantitative model of land- \nscape evolution that includes a realistic tectonic deformation \ninput and erosion by bedrock landslides, and have shown that \nit produces landscapes that are consistent with laboratory and \nfield observations. In particular, we draw the following conclu- \nsions: \n1. Our experiments support the hypothesis that bedrock \nlandsliding is an important process in the evolution of realistic \nmountainous topography. A weathering-limited diffusion rule, \nalthough appropriate for modeling regolith transport in many \nenvironments, cannot remove sufficient material from the \nmodel space using field-measured values of topographic diffu- \nsivity. While previous studies have simulated bedrock landslid- \ning by using artificially high diffusivities, we argue that such \napproaches obscure the contribution of discrete, large land- \nslide events to landscape development. \n2. Experimental rates of erosion due to bedrock landslid- \ning are comparable to those due to fluvial channel incision. In \naddition, the response time of individual hillslopes to changes \nin local baselevel is very rapid compared with the response \ntime of the channel network as a whole. These lines of evi- \ndence argue that fluvial and landsliding processes are tightly \ncoupled. In steady state, and in the absence of alternative \nmeans of generating landslides (such as groundwater sapping \nor seismic accelerations), fluvial channel incision is the rate- \nlimiting process of landscape evolution. Bedrock landslides \nallow the hillslopes to keep pace with channel incision. \n3. Rates of bedrock landsliding respond nonlinearly to \ntemporal changes in tectonic activity. On the basis of the rapid \nhillslope response, we attribute the bedrock landslide response \ntime to progressive aggradation and adjustment of the channel \nnetwork. \n4. A simple, stochastic bedrock landsliding algorithm is \nsufficient to generate landslide size distributions that show \npower law behavior, consistent with laboratory experiments. \nThere is some discrepancy between numerically derived and \nfield-measured exponent values, which may be due to differ- \nences in spatial resolution between the numerical model and \nremote-sensing measurement echniques, or to differences be- \ntween volume-frequency and area-frequency relationships. \nFinally, we wish to point out the need for additional data on \nlandslide size distributions and temporal sequences from a \n15,218 DENSMORE ET AL.: EVOLUTION OF MOUNTAINOUS TOPOGRAPHY \nvariety of geologic environments. In particular, we stress that \nfuture field investigations hould focus on fluvial and bedrock \nlandsliding processes, as our experiments demonstrate that \nthese are responsible for the bulk of the geomorphic work \ndone on the landscape. \nNotation \n,4 drainage area, m 2. \n\/3 topographic slope, rad. \n\/3crit critical topographic slope for shallow landsliding, \nrad. \nC cohesion, kg m -1 s -2. \nCr runoff coefficient, dimensionless. \nAt timestep, years. \nAx grid spacing, m. \nFef f component of weight of hillslope material along \nfailure plane, kg m s -2. \nFw weight of hillslope material, kg m s -2. \nFr resisting force along failure plane, kg m s -2. \n!7 gravitational cceleration, m s -2. \n3' unit weight, kg m -2 s -2. \nH hillslope height, m. \nHc maximum hillslope height, m. \nk diffusion coefficient, kg m-\u2022 s-\u2022. \n\u2022( diffusivity, m 2 s- 1. \nk a alluvial sediment transport coefficient, m 2 s 2 kg-1. \nk t, bedrock incision coefficient, m s 2 kg-1. \nkw channel width coefficient, dimensionless. \nL hillslope length, m. \n11 stream power per unit bed width, kg s -3. \n110 threshold stream power per unit bed width, kg s -3. \nIlextess excess stream power per unit bed width, kg s -3. \nP fail probability of failure, dimensionless. \nP precipitation rate, m s-1. \np bulk density, kg m -3. \nq5 material friction angle, rad. \nq s mass transport per unit width, kg m-\u2022 s-\u2022. \nQs volumetric transport ate per unit width, m 2 s-\u2022. \nR regolith thickness, m. \nR. depth of maximum regolith production, m. \nRs\u2022al e regolith production lengthscale, m. \nOR\/Ot regolith production rate, m yr -\u2022. \n(OR\/Ot)o surface regolith production rate, m yr -\u2022. \n(OR\/Ot). maximum regolith production rate, m yr -\u2022. \nS channel bed slope, rad. \n\u2022-\u2022 earthquake recurrence interval, years. \n0 failure plane dip, rad. \nOc critical angle of failure, deg. \nw channel width, m. \nz surface elevation, m. \nz t, bedrock surface elevation, m. \nAcknowledgments.
