Introduction\n[2] This paper explores the use of ULF (\u00011\u2013100 mHz)\nfield line resonances (FLRs), measured with ground\nmagnetometers, to examine the plasmapause region. This\nextends work in an earlier paper [Menk et al., 1999]\nthat used FLRs to monitor plasma density within the\nplasmasphere.\n[3] The plasmapause has been extensively studied with\nVLF whistler techniques [e.g., Carpenter and Park, 1973;\nPark et al., 1978] and satellite measurements [e.g.,\nChappell et al., 1971; Horwitz et al., 1990], and its\naverage structure is now well established. The position\nof the plasmapause in the midnight sector depends\ndirectly on Kp [e.g., De\u00b4cre\u00b4au et al., 1986] but on the\ndayside it is believed the plasmapause does not respond\nto changes in geomagnetic activity much faster than its\ncorotation time from the previous nightside [Carpenter,\n1970]. This is due to shielding of convection-driven\nelectric fields by the region 2 current with a time constant\nof the order of an hour [Senior and Blanc, 1984].\nHowever, recent satellite observations show that the\nresponse time of the dayside plasmapause may be almost\nas rapid as that on the nightside [Bezrukikh et al., 2001;\nLaakso and Jarva, 2001].\n[4] A variety of density features can occur near the\nplasmapause [e.g., Moldwin et al., 1994; Carpenter and\nLemaire, 1997; Carpenter et al., 2000; Sandel et al., 2001].\nStorm-time radial density profiles show mesoscale struc-\ntures that may include regions of cold detached plasma in\nthe dayside and evening plasmatrough [Chappell et\nal., 1971; Maynard and Chen, 1971]. Horwitz et al.\n[1990] presented a classification of six different types\nof plasma density profile, including cases where multiple\nplasmapauses and more complex structures are observed.\nAbout 60% of their density profiles exhibited features of\nthis nature, mostly in the afternoon and evening sectors.\nThe outer plasmasphere also exhibits considerable fine-\nscale (\u00021000 km) structure, predominantly in the noon\nto dusk sector [e.g., Chappell, 1974; Moldwin et al.,\n1995].\n[5] Deep within the plasmasphere, plasma motion is\ngenerally controlled by flux transfer through ionosphere-\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 109, A04216, doi:10.1029\/2003JA010097, 2004\n1School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences and Cooperative\nResearch Centre for Satellite Systems, University of Newcastle, Callaghan,\nAustralia.\n2Physics Department, University of York, York, United Kingdom.\n3Now at Physics Department, University of Alberta, Edmonton,\nCanada.\n4British Antarctic Survey, Madingley Road, Cambridge, United\nKingdom.\nCopyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/04\/2003JA010097$09.00\nA04216 1 of 17\nprotonosphere coupling and radial E \u0003 B drift of flux\ntubes driven by neutral winds in the ionosphere [Poulter\net al., 1984; Saxton and Smith, 1989]. Rapid fluctuations\nin solar wind or IMF conditions may transmit the\nmagnetospheric dawn-to-dusk electric field into the inner\nmagnetosphere [Saxton and Smith, 1991; Balmforth et al.,\n1994], driving cross-L drifts until the shielding layer\nadjusts to the new conditions. A sudden northward\nturning of the IMF may therefore result in overshielding\nand the formation of a plasmaspheric shoulder or bulge\n[Goldstein et al., 2002]. These effects cannot account for\nthe observed erosion of the plasmasphere during and\nfollowing storms [Clilverd et al., 2000; Chi et al., 2000].\n[6] Empirical estimates of the plasmapause position are\nbased on space-time averages that disguise the time\nvariability of plasma in this region. There is a need for\ndensity measurements spanning a range of L shells and\nlocal times with good spatial and temporal resolution.\nSeveral techniques are available but each has limitations.\nSome of these are now outlined.\n1.1. In Situ Measurements\n[7] The local electron density can be determined from in\nsitu plasma wave observations [Mosier et al., 1973;\nGurnett et al., 1979]. However, the orbital motion of\nsatellites makes it difficult to monitor the temporal evolu-\ntion of localized features. For example, Carpenter and\nAnderson [1992] examined the magnetospheric density\nusing (in part) upper hybrid wave data from the swept\nfrequency receiver (SFR) on the ISEE 1 satellite with an\norbital period of about 57 hours. By comparison, the\nCRRES satellite had a 10 hr orbital period, and its SFR\nexperiment provided electron density data with spatial\nresolution of order 50 km at typical plasmapause distances.\nThe experimental error in these densities is around 12%\n[Carpenter et al., 2000].\n[8] Direct measurements of ions and electrons have been\nreported by several workers [e.g., Horwitz et al., 1984;\nMoldwin et al., 1994]. However, positive charging of\nspacecraft surfaces in sunlight may exclude low energy\nions from detectors [Olsen, 1982]. Much of the plasma-\nspheric ion population has energy \u00023 eV [Moldwin et al.,\n1995]. This problem may be overcome by using negatively\nbiased ion counters, yielding an uncertainty in ion density\ntypically up to 30%. Furthermore, large ULF wave (e.g.,\nPc5) electric fields may cause particle motions into and out\nof spacecraft detectors, thus modulating particle count\nrates.\n[9] The plasma mass density can also be estimated from\nin situ measurements of the field line eigenfrequency [e.g.,\nTakahashi and McPherron, 1982]. However, the rapid\nmotion of spacecraft results in spectral broadening and\nphase shear in on-board magnetometer data [Anderson et\nal., 1989].\n1.2. Satellite Imagers\n[10] Optical remote sensing can provide important in-\nformation on the structure of the plasmasphere [Sandel et\nal., 2001]. In the case of the IMAGE spacecraft, the EUV\nimages encompass the entire plasmasphere with spatial and\ntemporal resolution of \u00020.1 RE and 10 min. The images\nconvey little spatial information along the line of sight,\nand information on the ion composition of the inner\nmagnetosphere is necessary to accurately interpret the\nimages during varying periods of geomagnetic activity\nlevels. Ground-based ULF and VLF measurements can\nbe used to intercalibrate the EUV Imager images [Clilverd\net al., 2003].\n1.3. Ground-Based Measurements of VLF Whistlers\n[11] Natural lightning-generated VLF whistler mode sig-\nnals have been extensively used to study the electron\ndensity distribution in the inner magnetosphere. However,\nit is difficult to obtain continuous observations over a range\nof L shells using whistlers, since not all lightning events\nresult in whistlers, and these whistlers propagate along\nfield-aligned ducts that are most favorably located about\n1.5 RE inside the plasmapause [Walker, 1978]. The whistler\nducts are formed by field-aligned electron density enhance-\nments of order 5\u201310% [Angerami, 1970] and up to 40%\n[Scarf and Chappell, 1973], lending some uncertainty to\nelectron density measurements.\n[12] Due to ionospheric absorption, VLF whistler mode\nsignals are difficult to detect when both ends of the flux tube\nare sunlit. VLF electron density measurements therefore\nfavor night time, or high latitudes when one hemisphere is\nnot sunlit. Furthermore, whistler mode signals only provide\ninformation on the electron density. Since the plasmaspheric\nrefilling rate may be different for different ion species\n[Singh and Horwitz, 1992] it is also of interest to monitor\nheavy ion populations in the radiation belts.\n[13] Whistler mode signals generated by continuously\noperating VLF transmitters can also be used to estimate\nthe magnetospheric electron density [Saxton and Smith,\n1989; Clilverd et al., 1991]. This provides better local time\ncoverage than with natural whistlers, but the frequencies\navailable restrict this technique to L \u0002 2.7.\n[14] The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the use of\nULF field line resonances to monitor spatial and temporal\nvariations in the magnetosphere, in particular near the\nplasmapause. These resonances occur mostly on the day-\nside. Phase and amplitude comparison techniques were\nemployed to measure the ULF field line eigenfrequency\nfrom the combined IMAGE and SAMNET magnetometer\narrays during January and March 1998. The resultant radial\nplasma density profiles span most of the magnetosphere,\nand the mass densities are compared with VLF-derived\nelectron densities. We show also that new information can\nbe obtained on time variations in plasma density in response\nto sudden solar wind variations.\n[15] ULF resonances can complement and extend whis-\ntler and spacecraft studies of the plasmapause region,\nbecause the basic data may be obtained from existing\nground magnetometer arrays spanning a range of latitudes\nand longitudes, and because the resonances may be ob-\nserved for many daylight hours on most days. Furthermore,\nsince the field line eigenfrequency is determined by the\nplasma mass density rather than the electron density, ULF\nmeasurements may provide extra information on the heavy\nion distribution. This is important because observations near\ngeostationary orbit suggest that the O+ density varies\nstrongly during the solar cycle and with changing magnetic\nactivity, while there is only a small effect on H+ density\n[Young et al., 1982]. Additionally, the O+ concentration is\nA04216 MENK ET AL.: FIELD LINE RESONANCE MONITORING OF PLASMAPAUSE\n2 of 17\nA04216\noften enhanced by an order of magnitude or more near the\nplasmapause [Roberts et al., 1987, and references therein].\n2. Observations and Data Analysis\n2.1. Detection of Field Line Resonances\n[16] Techniques for the detection of FLRs were summa-\nrized by Menk et al. [1999, 2000]. It is assumed that an\nAlfve\u00b4n eigenfrequency continuum exists throughout the\nmagnetosphere, while discrete driven FLRs (characterized\nby a peak in power spectra) appear as a resonant enhance-\nment in this continuum [Mathie et al., 1999]. Over a\nsuitably restricted range of latitudes properties of the local\nAlfve\u00b4n resonance are determined by the leading order\nvariations in amplitude and phase [Southwood, 1974]. The\nresonance may then be identified by the peak in H-compo-\nnent cross-power and cross-phase approximately mid-way\nbetween nearby latitudinally separated magnetometer sta-\ntions. The diurnal pattern of resonance behavior is most\nclearly seen using dynamic cross-phase spectra [e.g., Waters\net al., 1991].\n[17] The simultaneous signatures of a field line resonance\nbetween a poleward (P) and equatorward (E) station are:\n[18] 1. a peak in the H-component cross-phase spectrum,\nDfEP;\n[19] 2. a zero crossing in the H-component power differ-\nence spectrum, HP \u0004 HE;\n[20] 3. a unity crossing in the H-component power ratio\nspectrum, HP\/HE; and\n[21] 4. a dip in the coherence spectrum.\n[22] If the ground stations map to a region where the\nAlfve\u00b4n velocity changes rapidly, the cross-phase response\nmay include contributions arising from the local variations\nin Alfve\u00b4n velocity as well as the local FLR. Near a steep\nplasmapause the Alfve\u00b4n velocity passes through two turning\npoints over a spatial scale of the same order as the resonance\nwidths. Thus the assumption of a slowly varying back-\nground eigenfrequency profile is invalid, and two field lines\nmapping to either side of the plasmapause will show a\nreduced cross-phase [Menk et al., 1999].\n[23] Vellante et al. [2002] described a further polarization\nvector-based technique that has not been used here, and\nRees et al. [2001] discussed wavelet-based filtering that\nmay assist identification of the resonant frequency in cross-\nphase spectra, also not used here. Experience shows that the\ndifferent methods listed above may indicate slightly differ-\nent resonant frequencies. Following Menk et al. [1999,\n2000], we therefore identified the resonant frequency as\nthe frequency where the above criteria are most nearly\nsimultaneously satisfied. The uncertainty is taken as the\nrange of frequencies over which resonance signatures\noccur, plus the frequency resolution of the FFT (typically\n0.3 mHz).\n[24] It is also possible to identify the resonant frequency\nfrom single station data, where\n[25] 1. the ratio or difference between the H- and\nD-component power exhibits a peak [e.g., Vellante et al.,\n1993], and\n[26] 2. there is a rapid change in phase between the H and\nD components.\n[27] In the first case it is assumed that the resonance has\ngreater amplitude in the H-component than the D-compo-\nnent (i.e., the wave modes are decoupled), while in the\nsecond case the rapid change in phase of the H component\nidentifies the resonance.\n2.2. Magnetometer Data and Mass Densities\n[28] In order to monitor the radial plasma density distri-\nbution, we examined ULF FLRs during January and March\n1998 using the combined IMAGE and SAMNET ground\nmagnetometer arrays. Magnetic conditions during January\nwere generally quiet (average Kp \u0001 1.5), while March\nprovided a sample of more disturbed conditions, including\na Kp = 7+ magnetic storm.\n[29] Data were obtained from 21 stations of the\nIMAGE (International Monitor for Auroral Geomagnetic\nEffects) array, spanning 3.3 < L < 15 (56\u0002N to 76\u0002N)\nmostly between 15\u0002 and 27\u0002 geographic longitude. Fur-\nther details on IMAGE are given by Lu\u00a8hr et al. [1998].\nThe data were sampled in geographic coordinates at\n0.1 Hz (averaged from 1 s measurements) with a\nresolution of \u00010.1 nT, and rotated into geomagnetic (H, D)\ncoordinates before analysis.\n[30] The SAMNET (Sub-Auroral Magnetometer NET-\nwork) array [Yeoman et al., 1990] was operated by the\nUniversity of York and comprises digital fluxgate magneto-\nmeters that sample the geomagnetic H, D and Z components\nat 1.0Hzwith resolution<0.1 nT.Weuseddata from8 stations\nspanning 2.56 < L < 6.1 near 358\u0002 and 20\u0002 geographic\nlongitude. Some of the SAMNET and IMAGE stations are\nco-located, but the former have better time resolution. Local\ntime at SAMNETand IMAGE is in the range LT=UT to LT=\nUT + 2 hr.\n[31] Analysis of FLR activity involved inspection of\nhigh pass filtered (f > 1 mHz) time series and whole-day\ndynamic power, cross-power and cross-phase spectra to\ndetermine the presence of FLRs. This was done for all\ndays using up to 20 combinations of station pairs. The\ndynamic spectra were usually computed with a 256-point\n(43 min, IMAGE) or 2048-point (34 min, SAMNET) FFT\nweighted by a Hanning window and stepping in incre-\nments of 30 or 300 points respectively. The actual spectra\nexamined are in color and considerably clearer than the\nexamples shown here.\n[32] The resonant frequency was measured from dis-\ncrete H-component FFT cross-power, coherence, power\ndifference, power ratio, and cross-phase spectra on se-\nlected days. Examples of such discrete spectra are given\nby Menk et al. [1999, 2000] and Rees et al. [2001]. The\nspectra were computed over time windows mostly be-\ntween 30 and 60 min long, the shorter windows being\nused under more active conditions. This was done for\nmany days in January and March, but this paper only\npresents illustrative examples from 1, 8 and 11 January.\nDiscrete spectra were examined from typically 15 station\npairs for selected time intervals. In addition, discrete\nspectra of the H- and D-component cross-power, coher-\nence, power difference and cross-phase were also exam-\nined for 11\u201312 single stations at the same times on these\ndays, in order to provide measurement points where there\nwere no suitably spaced station pairs.\n[33] Such discrete spectra are only a \u2018snapshot\u2019 ap-\nproximation to the actual spectrum, and a different FFT\nwindow function may change details within a spectrum\nA04216 MENK ET AL.: FIELD LINE RESONANCE MONITORING OF PLASMAPAUSE\n3 of 17\nA04216\nbut not the underlying important features. This is because\nof the variability in pulsation signals on time scales\ncomparable to the FFT length, probably related to the\nwave packet nature of the pulsations. This variability\ntends to be averaged out in the whole-day spectra.\nTherefore start and end times of discrete spectra were\nchosen as far as possible to avoid the mixing of wave\npackets, and the whole-day dynamic spectra were used to\naid the interpretation of temporal variations in resonant\nfrequency. Vellante et al. [2002] found that for low\nlatitude FLRs the cross-phase and cross-power informa-\ntion is not affected by the choice of start and end times.\n[34] Mass densities were calculated from the measured\nresonant frequencies using expressions given by Taylor and\nWalker [1984] and Walker et al. [1992]. These assume\ndecoupled toroidal mode oscillations and yield essentially\nidentical results to the models described by Orr and\nMatthew [1971]. We represent the mass density in the\nequatorial plane (where the magnetic field strength and\nhence Alfve\u00b4n velocity along a field line generally reach a\nminimum) by a model distribution of the form R\u0004p. This is\ninvalid for very low or high latitude field lines, because of\nmass loading by ionospheric heavy ions, and field line\ndistortion. At higher latitudes the geomagnetic field was\ntherefore represented by the Olson-Pfitzer approximation\ndescribed by Singer et al. [1981] or by the Tsyganenko and\nStern [1996] model, T96. It is also assumed that the plasma\nis collisionless.\n[35] The choice of power law describing the radial\ndensity variation has been discussed by many authors\n[e.g., Gul\u2019yel\u2019mi, 1966; Denton and Gallagher, 2000;\nGoldstein et al., 2001]. Following previous work, we used\np = 3 (corresponding to diffusive equilibrium at low\nlatitudes) inside the plasmasphere, and p = 4 (corresponding\nto a collisionless distribution) outside the plasmapause. The\ncalculated mass density is relatively insensitive to the actual\nchoice of power law [Orr and Matthew, 1971; Walker et al.,\n1992]. In their global core plasma model, Gallagher et al.\n[2000] represented the plasmaspheric density by a power\nlaw expression whose leading order term is \u00040.79L + 5.3.\nAlthough we have used a simpler functional form, this does\nnot affect the determination of the plasmapause position.\n[36] The uncertainty in our calculated mass densities\ndepends on uncertainty in the frequency measurement\nthrough dependence of time of flight on the Alfve\u00b4n velocity,\nand is typically of order 15%. This is represented by error\nbars in plots shown later. Uncertainties due to the R\u0004p\nmodel approximation are ignored. Since the guided poloidal\nmode eigenfrequency is \u000130% lower than our assumed\npurely toroidal mode oscillations, wave mode coupling may\ncause the mass density to be slightly underestimated. This\nuncertainty is also not represented in the plots. The equa-\ntorial mass density can also be determined from comparison\nof toroidal mode resonance harmonics [Schulz, 1996]. That\nmethod requires observed frequencies to be accurate to\n\u00016% in order to obtain equatorial mass density with a\nprecision of 30% [Denton and Gallagher, 2000], and has\nnot been used here.\n[37] We also used magnetometer data from the 210\u0002 array\nfor a particular case study. For this purpose we obtained\n1-min averages of H-component digital data originally sam-\npled at 1 Hz from 11 stations lying near the 210\u0002 magnetic\nmeridian, and spanning 1.00 < L < 8.5 (4\u0002N to 70\u0002N) latitude.\nDetails on the array appear in Yumoto et al. [1992].\n2.3. VLF Data\n[38] Equatorial electron densities (Neq) were estimated for\nL shells beyond L\u0001 2.0 using natural VLFwhistlers recorded\nat Halley, Antarctica (geographic 76\u0002S, 27\u0002W, L = 4.3).\nHalley VLF data are recorded for one minute in each 15.\nThe whistlers are typically observed up to but not beyond the\nplasmapause, propagating in ducts of enhanced density with\ncross-L width of order 300\u2013400 km in the equatorial plane\n[Angerami, 1970]. The technique of Ho and Bernard [1973]\nwas used to determine the nose frequency and the travel time\nto the nose, and electron densities were then obtained using a\ndiffusive equilibrium model for the plasma distribution. The\nerror in evaluatingNeq is of order 5% [Ho and Bernard, 1973;\nPark, 1973]. Whistler studies from Halley were recently\nreviewed by Smith [2001].\n3. Results\n3.1. 1 January 1998\n[39] We first present illustrative results from 1 January\n1998. This is a magnetically quiet day (Kp \u0002 1.3, SKp =\n7.7) following almost three weeks of very quiet conditions,\nexcept for 30 December 1997, when Kp twice reached 4.7.\nOn 31 December SKp was 5.7.\n[40] Whole-day dynamic cross-phase spectra for four\nrepresentative station pairs are shown in Figure 1. The\nFLR appears as a narrow horizontal band from around\n02\u201317 UT (about 03\u201318 LT), ranging from 3\u20134 mHz for\nMUO:KIL (top panel) to \u00018 mHz for NUR:HAN (bottom).\nAdditional broadband structure is present at higher frequen-\ncies, from \u000114\u201345 mHz for MUO:HAN to \u000125\u201335 mHz\nfor NUR:HAN. This activity is not related to the FLRs that\noccur at lower frequencies and is not discussed further in\nthis paper. The spectra shown in Figure 1 are similar to\nthose presented by Milling et al. [2001] for similar latitudes,\nand the local times over which the resonances are observed\nare fairly typical.\n[41] Time series records from several stations for the\ninterval 0700\u20130800 UT are presented in Figure 2a. The time\nseries were high pass filtered at 1 mHz and show that\npulsation activity seems to fall into four latitude-dependent\ncategories. At the lower latitudes (\u000260\u0002 CGM, L \u0002 4),\npulsations are weak and of irregular appearance. Signals are\nsomewhat larger around 63\u201367\u0002 latitude (4 < L < 7), and the\nlargest amplitudes occur \u000171\u201374\u0002 latitude. Pulsation activ-\nity at the highest latitude stations (\u000575\u0002) is less intense and\nhas somewhat different structure to that at lower latitudes.\n[42] Figure 2b shows power spectra from several of these\nstations for the same interval presented above. For conve-\nnience the spectra have been spaced by 20 dB (one tick\nmark). There are no obvious systematic latitude-dependent\nchanges in the position of spectral peaks. Rather, peaks in\npower are present at several common frequencies, in par-\nticular \u00013\u20134 mHz and 30 mHz, across a range of latitudes.\nThis highlights the importance of using cross-phase type\ntechniques to detect FLRs, rather than simply choosing the\nfrequency where power peaks. The D-component spectra\n(not shown) generally have lower power and also display no\nobvious frequency-latitude relationship.\nA04216 MENK ET AL.: FIELD LINE RESONANCE MONITORING OF PLASMAPAUSE\n4 of 17\nA04216\n[43] Measurements of the resonant frequency (from\ndiscrete spectra as described in section 2.2) between\n0700 and 0800 UT are summarized in the top panel of\nFigure 3. Filled circles denote the mean of cross-phase,\npower difference and H\/H power ratio values between\nstation pairs, and open circles represent the result of single\nstation H\/D power ratio measurements. Error bars are\ncomparable to the symbol size at lower latitudes. The\nvertical arrows indicate the approximate expected plasma-\npause position, after Orr and Webb [1975]. It is clear that\nthe resonant frequencies measured by the two-station\ncross-phase\/power comparison and single station power\nratio methods fit a smoothly varying profile. The expected\nplasmapause position near L = 5.4 corresponds to a small\nincrease in resonant frequency. Slightly larger error bars in\nthis region result from frequency spread in the cross-phase,\npower difference and power ratio signatures.\n[44] The bottom panel in Figure 3 depicts plasma mass\ndensities derived from these resonant frequencies, where the\nsymbols have the same meaning as before. The mass\ndensity profile resembles an electron density profile shown\nby Carpenter and Anderson [1992] for a day with similar\nKp history (day 217). For comparison, the dotted line in\nFigure 3 represents the Carpenter and Anderson [1992]\nempirical electron density model for a saturated plasma-\nsphere including annual, seasonal and solar cycle effects.\nOur mass density profile shows somewhat higher values at\nlow L and lower values near and beyond the expected\nplasmapause position, as expected under the prevailing\nconditions.\n[45] Also shown in the bottom panel of Figure 3 are two\nelectron density values obtained from Halley whistler\nobservations near 0905 UT but 2\u20134 hours west of the\nmagnetometer stations. Each symbol and the associated\nerror bars represents the average and range of 5 separate\nwhistler measurements.\n[46] Mass density determinations for this day are sum-\nmarized in Figure 4. These are based on resonant frequen-\ncies measured each hour from IMAGE\/SAMNET and\nstations spanning 51\u201369\u0002 geomagnetic latitude. For conve-\nnience the profiles have been separated vertically by one\norder of magnitude. No distinct plasmapause is present at\nany time, although density perturbations are evident around\nL = 4, especially after noon. The two filled circles mapping\nto the 07 LT profile represent the VLF electron density\nmeasurements. There was no significant change in solar\nwind pressure over the times shown.\n3.2. 11 January 1998\n[47] This day followed a short Kp = 6+ disturbance on\n7 January and is typical of post-disturbed conditions. The\nDst index dropped from +6 nT at 15\u201316 UT on 6 January\nto a minimum of \u000477 nT at 04\u201305 UT on 7 January, and\nby 11 January had recovered to pre-disturbance values.\nWhole-day dynamic power and cross-phase spectra (not\npresented) show sustained pulsation activity and FLRs at\nthe IMAGE and SAMNET stations for much of this day.\nPower levels were higher than on 1 January.\n[48] The variation in resonant frequency with latitude at\nfour time intervals on 11 January is illustrated in Figure 5a.\nThese intervals are representative of daytime activity on\nthis day. The measurements were obtained from static\nspectra over time windows typically 40 min long at lower\nlatitudes and 60 min at higher latitudes. Error bars with no\ncorresponding data points denote instances where no single\nresonance signature was evident, but possible resonance\nFigure 1. Whole-day dynamic cross-phase spectra for\n1 January 1998. Station midpoints are, from top to bottom,\nnear L = 5.8 (MUO:KIL; station separation \u0001110 km), L =\n5.3 (PEL:MUO; 130 km), L = 4.0 (HAN:OUJ; 180 km), and\nL = 3.7 (NUR:HAN; 145 km). The field line resonance is\npresent as a narrow band below 10 mHz.\nA04216 MENK ET AL.: FIELD LINE RESONANCE MONITORING OF PLASMAPAUSE\n5 of 17\nA04216\nsignatures spanned a range of frequencies. These measure-\nments are mostly at higher frequencies and appear to be\nharmonics of the fundamental FLR. Data points appearing\nalong the latitude axis at 1 mHz frequency indicate cases\nwhere no resonance signature was apparent in the individual\nspectra. Notional lines of best fit have been drawn for\nillustrative purposes.\n[49] The 0600\u20130700 UT resonant frequency profile (top\npanel) decreases smoothly from 21 mHz at L = 2.5 to about\n6 mHz near L = 5.1, before increasing to about 10 mHz at\nL = 5.4 then decreasing beyond that. Measurements from\nthe two-station and single-station FLR detection techniques\nare again self-consistent. Turning points in the profile are\nindicated by the absence of resonance signatures at L = 4.8\nand L = 5.7.\n[50] The second panel shows a similar frequency-latitude\nstructure for 0900\u20131000 UT, except that: (a) resonance\nfrequencies are generally lower at lower latitudes; (b) there\nis some irregularity in the frequencies around L = 3.6;\n(c) the frequency peak has moved equatorward to L = 5.1;\nand (d) the maximum frequency of this peak has increased\nto around 15 mHz. The peak has moved further equatorward\nby 1200\u20131300 UT. Finally, by 1500\u20131600 UT the irregu-\nlarity around L = 3.7 has become more pronounced, and the\npeak has broadened and flattened.\n[51] Plasma mass density profiles corresponding to these\nfrequency plots are presented in Figure 5b. At 0600\u2013\n0700 UT (top panel) there is an order of magnitude decrease\nin mass density between L = 4.4 and L = 5.4. This is around\nthe plasmapause latitude predicted by the Orr and Webb\n[1975] estimate (and indicated by the vertical arrow). It is\nnot possible to precisely measure the plasmapause latitude,\nbut it is most likely near L = 5.2, between where the cross-\nphase signatures are suppressed. Elsewhere, in the plasma-\nsphere and plasmatrough, the mass densities fit a smooth\nprofile within experimental uncertainty.\n[52] The plasma mass density profile for 0900\u20131000 UT\nis generally similar, except that: (a) densities are a bit higher\nat lower latitudes; (b) there is an anomalous decrease in\ndensity (by a factor of about 2.5) near L = 3.6; (c) the\nplasmapause is now most likely around L = 4.8, at the\npredicted location; and (d) the density just poleward of\nthe plasmapause is lower than before. By 1200\u20131300 UT\nthe plasmapause gradient appears to be shallower, due to\nslightly higher poleward densities, and it is significantly\nequatorward of its predicted location (L = 4.4 compared to\nL = 5.2), suggesting the usual outward diurnal movement is\nnot evident. The density decrease near L = 3.6 is again\npresent.\n[53] Finally, by 1500\u20131600 UT the plasmapause appears\nto have moved further equatorward and become even\nshallower. However, a plateau has developed in the density-\nlatitude profile, extending inward from the expected plasma-\npause latitude, between about L = 4.8 and L = 6.8. The\nplasmapause is probably around L = 4.3. Mass densities in\nFigure 2a.

No resonance signature is now identifiable by the\npair of stations centered on L = 3.6. This means that the\nirregularity evident earlier has evolved to form a more\nlocalized structure whose radial width, projected to the\nground, is comparable to the station separation.\n[54] No whistlers were present in the Halley VLF data on\nthis day and therefore no comparisons with electron density\ndata are possible. During the times of interest the solar wind\nvelocity and pressure measured by the WIND spacecraft\nwere within the range 330\u2013380 km s\u00041 and 1.5\u20133.5 nPa, and\nBz fluctuated between maximum ranges of +4 and \u00048 nT.\nThe most significant southward turnings occurred at the\nmagnetopause near 0533, 1005, 1143, 1504 and 1555 UT.\n3.3. 8 January 1998\n[55] This day follows the geomagnetic disturbance dis-\ncussed above but SKp was only 14.7. Pulsation power\nlevels were about 20 dB higher than on quiet days, and\npower spectra (not shown here) exhibit clear peaks. Some of\nthese are latitude-dependent, but there are also peaks at\ncommon frequencies spanning many stations. The spectra\ndo not display any obvious frequency-latitude trend identi-\nfying the plasmapause location.\n[56] Well-defined resonance signatures are present most\nof this day in cross-phase spectra (also not presented\nhere) across the entire IMAGE\/SAMNET array. The\nspectra show unusually enhanced resonant frequencies\nbetween about 0800 and 1200 UT. A positive excursion of\n7 nT occurred in Dst at 10\u201311 UT, indicating a sudden\ncompression of the magnetosphere. Using an equation\npresented by Farrugia et al. [1989] indicates the magne-\ntopause moved from L = 13.1 at 0800 UT to L = 9.7 at\n1000 UT. H-component magnetograms from stations of the\n210\u0002 array show that two global impulses occurred at\n0831 UT and 1017 UT.\n[57] The temporal variation in plasma mass density for\nselected SAMNET\/IMAGE station pairs is illustrated in the\nFigure 3. Field line resonance frequencies (top panel)\nand plasma mass densities (bottom) for 0700\u20130800 UT,\n1 January 1998. Filled and closed circles denote two-station\nand single station measurements respectively. Arrows\nindicate predicted plasmapause latitude. In the bottom\npanel, triangles represent whistler-derived electron densities\nat 0905 UT, and dotted line shows Carpenter and Anderson\n[1992] model profile for a saturated plasmasphere.\nFigure 4. Variation of ULF-derived plasma mass density\nwith latitude and time on 1 January 1998. Filled circles\nrepresent VLF electron density measurements at 0905 UT,\nand heavy line represents profile closest in time to that\nshown in Figure 3.\nA04216 MENK ET AL.: FIELD LINE RESONANCE MONITORING OF PLASMAPAUSE\n7 of 17\nA04216\ntop panel of Figure 6. Densities were calculated using the\nOlson-Pfitzer magnetic field model for measurements\nof the resonant frequency from discrete 30-min spectra\nthat were stepped in 20-min increments. Mass densities\ncalculated with the T96 model (shown later) are some-\nwhat higher but display similar trends. The second panel\nshows the IMF Bz component, measured by the WIND\nspacecraft and with an appropriate propagation lag to the\nground included. The third panel similarly presents the\nsolar wind velocity, and the bottom panel the solar wind\npressure. Two solar wind pressure enhancements are\napparent, near 0830 UT and 1020 UT, and are identified\nby vertical dotted lines. The first coincides with a strong\ndecrease in Bz, although this does not become clearly\nsouthward.\n[58] The profiles in the top panel of Figure 6 show that\nbetween \u00010830 and 1030 UT mass density appeared to\ndecrease by a factor of about 3 for L > 4, with a smaller\ndecrease for L = 3.6 and none for L < 3. Diamonds and filled\ncircles denote Halley VLF electron densities for L = 2.6 and\nL = 3.6 ducts respectively, at the same UT but 25\u201350\u0002 west\nFigure 5a. Variation of resonant frequency with latitude\non 11 January 1998, between 0600\u20130700 UT (top panel),\n0900\u20131000 UT, 1200\u20131300 UT, and 1500\u20131600 UT\n(bottom). Symbols have the same meaning as in Figure 3.\nFigure 5b. Mass density profiles for times shown in\nFigure 5a.\nA04216 MENK ET AL.: FIELD LINE RESONANCE MONITORING OF PLASMAPAUSE\n8 of 17\nA04216\nof the magnetometers. The L = 2.6 electron and mass\ndensities show similar variation with UT, although this is\nnot as clear for the L = 3.6 measurements.\n[59] Next we consider frequency-latitude profiles, mea-\nsured using 40-min long spectra centered on each hour from\n0720 UT to 1220 UT (Figure 7a). For clarity no distinction\nis made between cross-phase, power comparison, or single\nstation power ratio values. The profiles show complicated,\ndynamic behavior between L = 3 and L = 7. The position\nand size of the frequency peak, and the frequency profile\nequatorward of this peak, change significantly from one\nhour to the next. Temporal variations occurring within a\nspectral window result in large uncertainties. The actual\nplasmapause position, indicated by the latitude where the\nresonant frequency suddenly changes, moves from L = 5.1\nto L = 4.0 during the times spanned by the profiles, and is\nalways well equatorward of the expected plasmapause\nlatitude represented by the vertical arrows.\n[60] The corresponding plasma density profiles calculated\nusing the T96 magnetic field model (i.e., including the\neffect of solar wind and Dst variations) are shown in\nFigure 7b in the same format as Figure 4. At 1020 UT\nsolar wind pressure exceeded the range of T96 input\nparameters and therefore for this profile the solar wind\npressure has been set to 10 nPa instead of the actual peak\npressure of 15.3 nPa. Since the profiles have been drawn\nby simply connecting measurement points they probably\nunderestimate the actual plasmapause gradient. Neverthe-\nless, it is clear that the plasmapause is well equatorward of\nits expected location (L = 6\u20137) and appears to move\ngenerally equatorward, with significant changes in shape\nbetween 0820 and 0920 UT, i.e., after the initial solar\nwind impulse. Density fluctuations are also apparent around\nL = 5\u20136.5.\n[61] Figure 7b also includes Halley VLF electron density\nobservations, denoted by filled circles. Each point repre-\nsents the average of several measurements near the indi-\ncated UT. The electron densities generally exhibit a similar\nvariation in latitude with UT as the mass densities.\n[62] Further information on the UT control of plasma-\nspheric density on this day is provided in Figure 7c,\nwhich compares the proportional change in observed\nelectron density (filled circles), observed resonant fre-\nquency (dotted line), and calculated mass density, be-\ntween 0820 UT and 0920 UT on 8 January. These times\nstraddle the increase in solar wind pressure from 1.3 to\n\u00014.6 nPa. The IMF By and Dst remained essentially\nconstant, and the plasmapause remained near L = 4.3\n(Figure 7b) during these times. The plot shows that the\nchange in mass density is almost a mirror image of the\nchange in resonant frequency, despite the changes in field\nline configuration that accompany the varying solar wind\nconditions. After the 0831 UT solar wind enhancement,\nmass and electron densities generally increased inward of\nL < 3.3 and decreased for L > 3.3. The largest depletions\nin mass density occurred near the plasmapause (L \u0001 4.3)\nand in the plasmatrough. Between L = 3.3\u20134.0 mass\ndensity decreased more than twice as much as electron\ndensity, and between L = 3.0 and L = 3.3 the increase in\nmass density was much greater than that in electron\ndensity. However, there was a strong increase in electron\ndensity for L < 3.0.\n[63] The observations for 8 January are not an isolated\nexample. Temporal variations in resonant frequency are\neasily identified in whole-day dynamic cross-phase spectra,\nand similar behavior has been observed on other days in\nassociation with sudden changes in solar wind pressure.\nOne such day is 31 January 1998, when ULF-derived mass\ndensities increased (decreased) inward of (beyond) L = 3.5\nimmediately after sudden increases in solar wind pressure in\nthe local evening sector.\n3.4. 8\u201319 March 1998\n[64] We now examine the plasmapause shape and loca-\ntion during a magnetic storm cycle. The top panel of\nFigure 8 shows mass density profiles at 12 UT for each\nday of 8\u201319 March. Tick marks on the x-axis correspond\nFigure 6.

The\nbottom panel shows Kp over these days.\n[65] This figure clearly illustrates the evolution of the\ndayside plasmapause with magnetic activity. For example,\non 7 March no plasmapause is evident, while small,\nirregular density variations are present around L = 4\u20135 on\n8, 9 and 10 March. The increase in Kp over 10\u201311 March\nresults in significantly lower mass densities for L > 3 at\n1200 UT on 12 March, consistent with the plasmapause\nhaving moved to L \u0002 3.0. A well-defined plasmapause\nis present around L = 3.4, 4.2, and 4.2 on 12, 13 and\n14 March. A large, steep plasmapause is present around\nL = 3.8\u20134.0 on 15 March; over the next few days this\ndecays to form two density gradients, until by 19 March no\nclear plasmapause remains.\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Identification of the Plasmapause Using FLRs\n[66] The cross-phase and power comparison techniques\nare powerful tools for the detection of FLRs, and permit the\nestimation of radial plasma density profiles using ground\nmagnetometer data and suitable density and magnetic field\nmodels. However, there are a number of complicating\nissues. These are discussed below with reference to the\nmodel plasma density and eigenfrequency profiles shown\nin Figure 9. The profiles are based on observations for\nFigure 7a. Variation of resonant frequency with latitude on 8 January 1998, between 0720 UT (top left)\nand 1220 UT (bottom right). Symbols have the same meaning as in Figure 3.\nA04216 MENK ET AL.: FIELD LINE RESONANCE MONITORING OF PLASMAPAUSE\n10 of 17\nA04216\n0900\u20131000 UT on 11 January 1998 and the model profiles\ndescribed by Poulter and Allan [1986] and Carpenter and\nAnderson [1992]. The plasmapause is represented with a\nwidth of 0.2 RE. Filled circles denote the projection to the\nequatorial plane of hypothetical ground magnetometer\nstations separated in geographic latitude by about 110 km.\nObservationally we find that this is about the optimum\nstation separation at which resonance signatures are most\nreliably detected. More closely spaced stations may view\noverlapping flux tubes while larger station separations\ndiminish the spatial resolution. The dashed lines in\nFigure 9 represent a model density trough of the form\ndescribed by Carpenter et al. [2000].\n4.1.1. Cross-Phase Signature of the Plasmapause\n[67] The variation in ULF wave phase and amplitude\nacross locally resonant field lines in the plasmatrough,\nplasmapause and plasmasphere was described by Orr and\nHanson [1981]. However, the cross-phase, power difference\nand power ratio spectra measured between two magneto-\nmeters at slightly different L values depend on how the\nAlfve\u00b4n velocity varies between the field line apexes. A non-\nlinear variation in Alfve\u00b4n velocity on this scale distorts the\nphase and amplitude variations, and two field lines mapping\nto the same eigenfrequency straddling the plasmapause will\nshow near-zero cross-phase.\n[68] The dotted horizontal lines in the bottom panel of\nFigure 9 illustrate how this may occur across the equator-\nward or poleward boundary of the plasmapause. Such phase\n\u2018\u2018drop-outs\u2019\u2019 provide a means of identifying the plasma-\npause position [Milling et al., 2001]. Cross-phase \u2018drop-\nouts\u2019 are represented in Figures 5a, 5b, and 7a by data\npoints plotted on the abscissa. Similarly, the cross-phase is\nreduced when ground stations map to nearly (but not quite)\nthe same eigenfrequency across a plasmapause boundary.\nThis also increases the measurement uncertainty near the\nplasmapause, as seen in the same figures.\n4.1.2. Spatial Resolution\n[69] When using two-station cross-phase and power com-\nparison techniques the spatial resolution is determined by\nthe resonance width and the separation in latitude between\nthe ground magnetometers. The characteristic width of a\nFLR at middle latitudes is of order 100 km at the ionosphere\n[Menk et al., 1999, and references therein]. This relates to\nflux tubes with radial extent in the equatorial plane of about\n0.15 RE (1.0\u0003 103 km) at L = 3 and\u00010.4 RE (2.6\u0003 103 km)\nat L = 5.5. It will not be possible to resolve structures\nsmaller than this using FLR measurements.\n[70] Figure 9 clearly shows that an array of closely spaced\nground magnetometers can detect a plasmaspheric density\ntrough of the form represented by the dashed lines, whereas\nsimilar features in the plasmatrough, and the width of the\nplasmapause itself, cannot be resolved in this case. For\ncomparison, the swept frequency receiver on ISEE 1 sam-\npled the plasma density along its orbit every 32 s, resulting\nin a spatial resolution of order 150 km [Carpenter and\nAnderson, 1992].\nFigure 7b. Plasma mass density profiles for times\nshown in Figure 7a, separated by one order of magnitude.\nCircles represent VLF electron density measurements at\nthe same UT.\nFigure 7c. Change in VLF-derived electron density\n(filled circles), ULF resonant frequency (dotted line) and\nULF-derived mass density (solid line) between 0820 and\n0920 UT on 8 January 1998.\nA04216 MENK ET AL.: FIELD LINE RESONANCE MONITORING OF PLASMAPAUSE\n11 of 17\nA04216\n[71] The spatial resolution when using single station H\/D\nmeasurements is determined by spatial integration effects\n[e.g., Hughes, 1974; Poulter and Allan, 1985]. Consider a\ndowngoing ULF wave that generates Hall currents with\nhorizontal scale size Li in the ionospheric E-region. The\nground magnetic field perturbation can be calculated from\nthe Biot-Savart law and has a larger scale size, Lg \u0006 2H + Li,\ndue to the field from the integrated ionospheric current\nas seen on the ground. The spatial resolution at the ground\nis therefore about 200 km, no better and possibly worse\nthan that achieved using cross-phase and amplitude sub-\ntraction techniques that compare the difference between\ntwo stations.\n[72] There is a further complication. Poulter and Allan\n[1986] examined the response in the ionosphere and on the\nground to transient ULF waves arriving at the plasmapause.\nThey found that the sharp variation in period with latitude in\nthe ionospheric Hall currents is smeared out on the ground\nas the currents become spatially incoherent. The frequency\nvariation across the plasmapause detected by ground mag-\nnetometers is thus smoothed compared to the actual varia-\ntion, by a factor that depends on the density gradient in the\nequatorial plane.\n[73] In Poulter and Allan\u2019s model the resonant frequency\nmeasured at the ground increased by \u000115% at the equator-\nward edge of the plasmapause, remained enhanced by\n\u000110% up to 4\u0002 further equatorward, and decreased by\n\u000125% at the poleward edge. This smoothing of the plas-\nmapause profile causes underestimation of the density at the\nequatorward side and overestimation at the poleward edge.\nFurthermore, Poulter and Allan [1986] used a relatively\nbroad (DL = 1.0) plasmapause profile, so the smoothing\neffect will be more pronounced for steeper profiles. Such\nsmoothing appears to be present in the measured profiles\nshown in Figure 5b.\n4.1.3. Cross-Phase Reversal at the Plasmapause\n[74] The cross-phase between two ground stations is\ninverted when these stations map to the portion of the\nAlfve\u00b4n velocity profile at the plasmapause where the slope\nis reversed [Menk et al., 1999]. In Figure 9 this corresponds\nto the region between L = 4.5 and L = 4.7. The cross-phase\nreversal in this region may be used, in principle, to monitor\nthe exact plasmapause location [Waters, 2000]. In reality\nthis may be difficult to achieve, because (i) it requires a\nsuitably wide, linear plasmapause to fortuitously straddle\nthe measuring stations; (ii) due to spatial resolution issues\ndiscussed above ground magnetometers located precisely at\nthe Alfve\u00b4n velocity turning points will also map a consid-\nerable distance either side of the plasmapause; and (iii) the\nmedian dayside plasmapause width of \u00010.2 RE [Carpenter\nand Anderson, 1992] is smaller than the typical spatial\nresolution of FLR measurements. This is illustrated in\nFigure 9, where only one measurement station lies on the\nplasmapause.\n4.1.4. Width of the Plasmapause\n[75] A survey by Laakso and Jarva [2001] of over 6000\nPolar spacecraft crossings of the plasmapause found that\nwhile the density variation at the nightside plasmapause is\nusually very sharp, for the dayside plasmapause this is often\nquite gradual, so that the plasmapause location cannot be\nFigure 8. Plasma mass density profiles (top panel) and Kp index (bottom) over 7\u201319 March 1998.\nMass densities are for 1200 UT on each day, where each date label in the top panel is at L = 6.0 and x-axis\ntick marks denote steps of 1.0 L.\nA04216 MENK ET AL.: FIELD LINE RESONANCE MONITORING OF PLASMAPAUSE\n12 of 17\nA04216\ndefined accurately. Under such circumstances FLR mea-\nsurements may be able to provide important information on\nthe mass density and its distribution near the plasmapause.\nSpecifically, Carpenter and Anderson\u2019s [1992] Figure 7a\nshows that 5 of 24 \u2018smooth\u2019 plasmapause widths between\n06\u201318 MLT exceeded 1500 km. FLR observations with\nground magnetometers 100 km apart may therefore resolve\na \u2018smooth\u2019 plasmapause in about 20% of cases. At other\ntimes FLR measurements will only provide an upper limit\non the plasmapause width.\n[76] In practice we find that under average and disturbed\ngeomagnetic conditions resonance signatures are readily\nobtained either side of the plasmapause but only occasion-\nally across it. For comparison, VLF whistler ducts are\ntypically 300\u2013400 km wide in the equatorial plane and\nare also unlikely to straddle the plasmapause [Smith,\n2001]. One advantage of the ULF resonance observations,\nhowever, is that they relate to the dayside where the\nplasmapause is less accessible to whistler measurements.\n4.1.5. Local Time Distribution\n[77] We find that resonances are observable on most days,\neven at magnetically quiet times such as 1 January 1998,\nwhen power levels are low. Resonant structure is usually\nevident between about 03 and 16 MLT, but can occasionally\nextend over virtually the entire 24-hour day, particularly at\nhigher latitudes where power levels are higher. Resonant\nstructure is also apparent for Pi2 pulsations at substorm\nonset, and could in principle be used to estimate mass\ndensities in the bulge region.\n4.1.6. Amplitude Variation Across the Plasmapause\n[78] The density variation at the plasmapause can reflect a\nsubstantial fraction of incoming wave energy. The reflection\ncondition is given by Allan and Knox [1979]:\nR \u0006 A1 \u0004 A2\nA1 \u00fe A2\n\u0001 \u00022\n\u00f01\u00de\nwhere A1 and A2 are the Alfve\u00b4n speeds just inside and\njust outside the plasmapause respectively. For instance, on\n11 January mass density drops across the plasmapause by a\nfactor of about 40, so R \u0006 0.52. Accordingly, the power\ndifference or ratio between two stations spanning the\nplasmapause shows an offset that may also be used to\ndetect the plasmapause position. Furthermore, the plasma-\npause may affect the FLR decay or damping rate in a\ncharacteristic manner [Poulter and Allan, 1986].\n4.2. Effect of Heavy Ions\n[79] The shape and dynamic behavior of the plasmapause\nmay be significantly different for ions compared to elec-\ntrons. For example, Figure 1a of Singh and Horwitz [1992]\nshows in situ observations where the O+ density near the\nplasmapause varies markedly following a geomagnetic\nstorm.\n[80] Field line resonance observations can be used to\nestimate the proportion of heavy ions in two ways. The\nfirst simply involves comparison of ULF-derived mass\ndensities with VLF electron densities [Menk et al., 1999],\nwith suitable corrections for local time or longitudinal\neffects. We consider two examples.\n[81] Figure 3 shows that on 1 January the Halley electron\ndensities at L \u0001 4 at 0700 LT were almost double the\ncorresponding mass densities \u00010920 LT. Figure 4 demon-\nstrates that the mass density profiles do not change signif-\nicantly between these times. In early January the Halley\nionosphere is continuously sunlit and photoelectron produc-\ntion is enhanced. Because Halley is at relatively low\ngeographic latitude, horizontal ionospheric winds can drive\nthe extra electrons up field lines, increasing the equatorial\nelectron density by a factor of \u00012.3 at L = 2.5 at that\nlongitude [Clilverd et al., 1991]. The electron and mass\ndensities seen in Figure 3 therefore seem reasonable for a\npredominantly electron-proton plasma. On 8 January, fol-\nlowing a short magnetic storm, the whistler electron densi-\nties are similar to the mass densities at the same UT (e.g.,\nFigure 7b). If we ignore the LT separation between the\nwhistler and ULF observatories these measurements could\nbe accounted for by a plasma comprising, for example, 75%\nH+, 20% He+ and 5% O+ by number at L = 2.5.\n[82] The second method for estimating the plasma com-\nposition involves comparing the frequency of resonance\nharmonics. The presence of heavy ions results in irregular\nspacing of harmonics [Troitskaya and Gul\u2019yel\u2019mi, 1970;\nPoulter et al., 1988]. Price et al. [1999] showed how the\nFigure 9. Model profiles of plasma density (top panel)\nand resonant frequency (bottom) for conditions similar to\n0900 UT on 11 January 1998. Filled circles denote L values\nof (hypothetical) ground stations each separated by 110 km.\nDashed line segments illustrate a plasmaspheric density\ntrough. Horizontal dotted lines in bottom panel represent\nresonances at the same frequency either side of the\nplasmapause.\nA04216 MENK ET AL.: FIELD LINE RESONANCE MONITORING OF PLASMAPAUSE\n13 of 17\nA04216\nharmonic spacing may be used to obtain the plasma density\nat several points along a low latitude field line, while Menk\net al. [1999] estimated the plasma density power law index\nfrom the harmonic spacing of mid-latitude FLRs.\n[83] Using 48 months of ion composition data from\nGEOS 1 and 2, Young et al. [1982] statistically described\nthe variation in ion density near geostationary orbit with\ngeomagnetic and solar activity. They considered the energy-\nper-charge range 0.9\u201315.9 keV\/e. From their results, we\nmay expect the O+\/H+ ratio in ion mass density to be as high\nas 0.75 for Kp = 6.3 on 7 January, reducing to 0.21 when\nKp = 1 on 8 January. In contrast, Young et al. [1982] found\nno significant dependence on magnetic activity for He+\ndensity. It therefore seems likely that the higher mass\ndensities observed on 8 January can be attributed to en-\nhanced O+ densities on that day.\n[84] The mass density profiles presented in Figure 8 show\nthe steepest plasmapause on 15 March, some days after Kp\nreached 7+ and following moderate magnetic activity.\nClearly the plasmapause shape varies in a complex manner\nand will be strongly influenced by changes in the heavy ion\nconcentration associated with loss and refilling processes.\nFLR measurements allow plots of this type to produced for\nessentially all local day times. When combined with\nground-based or in situ electron density data, it would be\npossible to systematically examine the variation in heavy\nion mass loading during a storm cycle.\n4.3. Quiet-Time Plasmapause\n[85] Plasma mass density measurements were presented\nfor a typical quiet day in section 3.1. Figure 3 shows that the\nlatitude of the vestigial plasmapause determined with ULF\nresonances generally agrees with the Orr and Webb [1975]\nempirical prediction. The ULF-derived mass densities\ngenerally have uncertainty <20% and agree well with\nelectron density profiles for similar geomagnetic conditions\n[Carpenter and Anderson, 1992]. There is also evidence in\nFigure 4 of density perturbations evolving in the outer\nplasmasphere, around L = 4. It is clear that under quiet\nconditions FLR measurements are able to provide useful\nmass density information throughout the magnetosphere,\nincluding in the vicinity of the plasmapause.\n4.4. Source of the Pulsation Signals\n[86] Ground-based monitoring of the magnetospheric\nplasma using FLRs requires a broadband source of wave\nenergy. We find that it is possible to determine the radial\ndensity profile using FLRs on most days. The resonant\nfrequency at the plasmapause typically extends up to\n20 mHz, as modeled by Poulter and Allan [1986], but not\ngenerally up to 40 mHz as suggested by Orr and Hanson\n[1981]. However, signals above the resonant frequency are\noften present near the plasmapause.\n[87] Spacecraft measurements [e.g., Takahashi and\nMcPherron, 1982] show that a continuum of resonances is\npresent throughout the magnetosphere at least some of the\ntime. Our observations and previous cross-phase studies\n[Waters et al., 1991; Menk et al., 1999] demonstrate that\nFLRs can be detected even when there is little power at\nthose frequencies. Broadband waves may be produced by\nimpulsive sources, but it is not apparent whether this can\nexplain FLRs observed at quiet times. Other possible source\nmechanisms include the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, mag-\nnetospheric cavity and waveguide modes [Mann et al.,\n1999], and penetration into the magnetosphere of compres-\nsional mode waves generated by the ion-cyclotron mecha-\nnism in the upstream solar wind [e.g., Howard and Menk,\n2001]. Cavity and waveguide modes may produce a comb\nof discrete frequencies in the magnetosphere, while the\nfrequency of upstream waves is determined by the IMF\nmagnitude and cone angle. We find that pulsation power in\nthe magnetosphere is strongly dependent on IMF cone\nangle, but resonances can be reliably detected across a\nrange of frequencies (i.e., latitudes) under a variety of cone\nangle conditions.\n4.5. Detection of Density Irregularities and Temporal\nVariations\n[88] As illustrated in Figure 9, plasmaspheric density\ndepletions of the form described by Carpenter et al.\n[2000] can be readily detected with FLR measurements. A\ndepletion in mass density by a factor of 2\u20132.5 near L = 3.6\nis seen in the 0900 and 1200 UT profiles on 11 January\n(Figure 5b). The radial extent of the depletion is 0.2\u20130.35\nRE. By 1500 UT the depletion can no longer be resolved,\nmeaning that its radial extent then is <0.2 RE. We have no\ninformation on the longitudinal extent of this depletion, and\nit may be co-rotating. Although this feature is somewhat\nsmaller than the electron density depletions reported by\nCarpenter et al. [2000], it is clear that FLR measurements\ncan provide new information on plasmaspheric density\nstructures.\n[89] For a given station pair, resonance signatures are\nmost clearly identified under quiet magnetic conditions.\nWith increasing activity the cross-phase and power com-\nparison spectra become less ordered and the uncertainty in\nestimating the resonant frequency increases. This is proba-\nbly due to the formation of plasma density irregularities\nwith scale sizes and on time scales less than the spatial and\ntemporal resolution.\n[90] The temporal resolution of ULF-based density mea-\nsurements depends on the FFT window length used to\nproduce each cross-phase and power comparison spectrum.\nWe adjusted the window start and end time times in accord\nwith pulsation activity, using shorter windows when mag-\nnetic activity increases, and longer windows as pulsation\nfrequency decreases. Temporal resolution is generally be-\ntween 20 and 60 min. Under magnetically disturbed con-\nditions the plasma distribution in the sampled region may\nchange significantly during this time, resulting in extra\nfeatures and distortions in the cross-phase and power\ncomparison spectra. This is depicted in Figures 5 and 7\nby measurements with particularly large error bars, or error\nbars where no measured value is shown.\n[91] Occasionally more than one distinct resonance sig-\nnature can be simultaneously identified in the cross-phase\nand power difference spectra. These \u2018secondary resonance\u2019\nfeatures are not harmonically related to the primary FLR\nand typically have lower power. They may appear or\ndisappear from one spectrum to the next, or may be present\nfor a few hours. Considering the spatial and temporal\nresolution of the spectra, such secondary features may either\nbe due to a localized density perturbation (scale size <field\nof view) or a perturbation evolving or moving through the\nA04216 MENK ET AL.: FIELD LINE RESONANCE MONITORING OF PLASMAPAUSE\n14 of 17\nA04216\nfield of view during the analysis period. Thus, although\nFLR techniques cannot resolve such structures, they can at\nleast suggest their presence.\n4.6. Effects of Solar Wind Variations\n[92] Here we consider possible causes of the sudden\nreductions in ULF-derived mass density observed in\nconnection with solar wind pressure enhancements on\n8 and 31 January.\n[93] The pressure balance along a flux tube governs the\nionosphere-magnetosphere flux interchange. Although\nthis is controlled by many factors [e.g., Hanson and\nOrtenburger, 1961; Poulter et al., 1988], ionization flow\nfrom the magnetosphere to the ionosphere enhances the\nF-region critical frequency, foF2, within 20 min of a\nsubstorm onset [Park, 1973]. After about one hour inward\nE \u0003 B motion of plasma causes a reduction in the height\nof F2 layer peak. We examined ionospheric data obtained\nfrom the World Data Centre for Solar-Terrestrial Science\n(Sydney; http:\/\/www.ips.gov.au\/wdc-sts\/) for various ob-\nservatories near the IMAGE meridian, including Juliusruh\/\nRugen (L = 2.7), Uppsala (L = 3.3), Lerwick (L = 3.6),\nLycksele (L = 4.5) and Kiruna (L = 5.5) for the times of\ninterest on 8 January. It was not possible to discern any\nvariations in foF2 or hmF2 that could be clearly related to\nthe magnetospheric mass density decreases or the solar\nwind pressure enhancements on that day. Therefore the\nobserved changes in the density profiles are unlikely to be\ndue to magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling effects.\n[94] Mass densities derived from FLR measurements are\naffected by motion of magnetic field lines in response to\nmagnetospheric distortion by solar wind pressure variations.\nConsidering the time of flight approximation [e.g., Orr and\nMatthew, 1971], the resonant frequency wr depends on\ndensity r according to\nwr \/\nZ\nBffiffi\nr\np : 1\nds\n: \u00f02\u00de\nA change in resonant frequency may therefore be caused by\nchanges in B and field line length as well as changes in\ndensity. A second mechanism is also important. By\nFaraday\u2019s law, variations in B, dB\/dt, for a given field line\ninduce changes in E that can also drive cross-L plasma\nmotion.\n[95] The sudden solar wind pressure enhancement at\n0831 UT on 8 January resulted in magnetospheric compres-\nsion and global DP 2-like impulses in ground magnetometer\nrecords (not shown). It is clear from Figure 7c that the solar\nwind pressure enhancement caused a redistribution of\nplasma on a time scale of less than one hour. The difference\nbetween the observed variation in mass density and electron\ndensity may be related the presence of heavy ions or\nlongitudinal differences in the magnetospheric electric fields\nand convective drifts between the flux tubes sampled by the\nIMAGE magnetometers and the Halley VLF receiver.\n[96] It is likely that undershielding effects (see section 1)\ndominate plasma motion beyond L = 3.3 on 8 January\nbetween 0820 and 0920 UT. The sudden solar wind\npressure enhancement at 0831 UT was accompanied by a\nstrong decrease in Bz (Figure 6). We therefore anticipate that\nconvection electric fields penetrating to the inner magneto-\nsphere would drive sunward cross-L E \u0003 B drift of flux\ntubes, resulting in a decrease in mass and electron density\nbetween L = 3.3 and the plasmapause (L \u0001 4.3). A different\neffect is required to explain the pronounced increase in\nelectron density for L < 3.0.\n[97] The sudden formation of DP 2 currents should also\ngenerate polar electrojets that can be detected with high\nlatitude magnetometers and are characterized by the AE\nindex. Information on electrojet locations is available from\nthe IMAGE magnetometer array web site. In averaged data\nfor 1998 no electrojet is present at 0830 UT, and the\neastward electrojet usually appears around 1100 UT be-\ntween \u000170\u201374\u0002 latitude. On 8 January eastward electrojet\nflows appeared briefly at 0830 UT, with the poleward\nboundary at 76\u0002 and the equatorward boundary moving\nfrom 72\u201374\u0002 geomagnetic latitude. The electrojet flows\nbecame sustained after 1030 UT, when the poleward\nboundary was around 76\u0002 and the equatorward boundary\noscillated between 71\u201373\u0002 latitude. The local AU and AE\nindices show brief but significant increases in connection\nwith the first and second solar wind enhancements.\n[98] In summary, the sudden increase in solar wind\npressure and southward turning in the IMF BZ on 8 January\n1998 resulted in magnetospheric compression and enhanced\nmagnetospheric convection electric fields. The former were\nidentified by impulses on ground magnetometers. However,\nthe main effect on the magnetospheric plasma seems due to\nthe penetration electric field that likely caused cross-L drifts\nand observed decreases in plasma density. The magnitude of\nthese changes is significantly larger for ions than for\nelectrons, probably due to enhanced O+ concentrations,\nand is maximum at the plasmapause.\n5. Conclusions\n[99] This study has explored the use of ground magne-\ntometer data to obtain field line eigenfrequencies and hence\nmass densities throughout the magnetosphere, in particular\naround dayside plasmapause. We examined data from\nJanuary and March 1998 from the combined IMAGE and\nSAMNET arrays with cross-phase and power comparison\ntechniques, presenting case studies of three selected days.\n[100] Under geomagnetically quiet conditions FLR-de-\nrived plasma density profiles often do not show a sharp\nplasmapause and closely resemble electron density profiles\nobtained under similar conditions, suggesting a primarily\nelectron-proton plasma. The resonances are not apparent in\npower spectra but are clearly evident in cross-phase spectra.\nSufficient ULF energy exists in the magnetosphere to excite\nthe resonance continuum over a broad range of frequencies\neven at quiet times. The measured latitudes of the plasma-\npause and the magnetopause agree well with empirical\nestimates. The calculated mass densities are significantly\nlower than simultaneous whistler-derived electron densities\nfrom a longitude sector in the southern hemisphere that is\ncontinuously sunlit. Uncertainty in the mass densities is\ntypically <20%.\n[101] During storm recovery phase a distinct plasmapause\nis present in the FLR mass density profiles. It is possible to\nresolve the dayside plasmapause itself in about 20% of\ncases, and most often the resonance measurements only\nprovide an upper limit to the plasmapause width. Further-\nA04216 MENK ET AL.: FIELD LINE RESONANCE MONITORING OF PLASMAPAUSE\n15 of 17\nA04216\nmore, the calculated densities are smoothed near the plas-\nmapause edges due to spatial integration effects. Compari-\nson of the mass and electron densities allows the heavy ion\nmass loading to be estimated. Observed variations in the\nshape and position of the dayside plasmapause are not\npredicted by empirical models. Plasmaspheric density deple-\ntions with radial width \u00050.15 RE at L = 3 and \u00050.4 RE at\nL = 5.5 can be resolved. The presence of complex plasma\nfeatures that cannot be resolved can frequently be inferred.\nThese are likely due to density perturbations with relatively\nsmall scale sizes, and features that undergo significant\nchange on a time scale of \u000130\u201360 min.\n[102] On disturbed days sudden changes in mass density\nmay be observed across widely spaced L-values within\n\u000120 min of solar wind pressure variations. Whistler-derived\nelectron densities also show variation but do not track\nthe changes in mass density in the case examined. The\nsolar wind-related density variations probably arise from\na combination of cross-L drifts driven by enhanced magne-\ntospheric convection fields, the effect of field line distortion\ndue to magnetospheric compression, and longitudinal\nvariations in plasma dynamics between the ULF and VLF\nrecording stations.\n[103] Field line resonances occur daily. The analysis of\nFLR data from existing magnetometer arrays permits in-\nvestigation of aspects of the dayside plasmasphere that are\nstill poorly understood. Issues for future work include\ndetailed investigation of density depletions and other per-\nturbations in the plasmasphere; monitoring the evolution of\nthe storm-time plasmapause, and hence the role of heavy\nion loss and refilling processes; and examining in detail the\nresponse of plasma in the dayside magnetosphere to solar\nwind variations. Furthermore, the extensive existing suites\nof magnetometer data permit retrospective studies of focus\nintervals.\n[104] Acknowledgments.
