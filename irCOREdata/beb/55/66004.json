Much of the debate has focussed on data from the US, and little \nresearch has examined parents\u2019 motives for sleeping with their infants.  This \npaper examines parental bed-sharing practices with young infants in North Tees, \nUK.  We found that bed-sharing was a common night-time care-giving strategy, \nand the reasons articulated by parents for bed-sharing with their small infants \nwere varied.  There was a particularly strong association between bed-sharing \nand breastfeeding, however infant irritability or illness was also a frequently \ngiven reason for bed-sharing, and a number of other reasons emerged.  We \nconclude it is important that circumstance and motivation are considered in \nassessments of bed-sharing safety, and parental reasons for bed-sharing are \nacknowledged in formulating advice for parents regarding bed-sharing. \n \n 3\nIntroduction \nAlthough much has been written in recent years regarding the pros and \ncons of parent infant bed-sharing, little research has examined parents\u2019 motives \nfor sleeping with their infants, or explored the ramifications of the variety of \nreasons that might bring an infant to sleep in a parental bed.  Controversy \nregarding parent-infant bed-sharing in westernised cultures has been fuelled by \ncontradictory research findings regarding the calculated risks and perceived risks \nand benefits of bed-sharing (Scragg, Mitchell et al. 1993; Byard 1994; Farooqi, Lip \net al. 1994; Klonoff-Cohen and Edelstein 1995; Scragg, Stewart et al. 1995; Mosko, \nRichard et al. 1996; McKenna, Mosko et al. 1997; Blair, Fleming et al. 1999; Drago \nand Dannenberg 1999; Kelley 2000; Kemp, Unger et al. 2000; McKenna 2000; \nCarroll-Pankhurst 2001).  Some have gone so far as to recommend a \u2018ban\u2019 on \nparent-infant bed-sharing (U.S.C.P.S.C. 1999; Nakamura, Wind et al. 1999), while \nothers advocate further research (Gilbert 1994; O'Hara, Harruff et al. 2000; \nMcAfee 2000; Grossman 2000) and recommendations for parents regarding safe \nbed-sharing (Mermer 2000; Sugrue 1995).  As yet, however, the discussion takes \nplace with only a poor understanding of who bed-shares, how, and why, and \nwith what outcome.    \nEthnographic studies of non-westernised cultures reveal a wide array of \npractices that can be loosely defined as \u2018bed-sharing\u2019 (Caudill and Plath 1966; \nBarry and Paxson 1971; Lee 1992; Morelli, Rogoff et al. 1992; Nelson and Chan \n1996; McKenna 2000). In most non-western cultures mother-infant contact \nsleeping is the norm (Barry and Paxson 1971), as it is in many minority ethnic \nsubgroups in Euro-American countries e.g. (Lozoff, Wolf et al. 1984; Gantley, \n 4\nDavies et al. 1993; Farooqi, Perry et al. 1993; Tuohy, Smale et al. 1998).  For the \nmajority populations in Euro-American countries estimates of bed-sharing \nprevalence have ranged upwards from 12% (Tuohy, Counsell et al. 1993) to 80% \n(Rigda, McMillen et al. 2000), depending on how the study sample was \ngenerated, how bed-sharing was defined, and how data were gathered.   \nThe physiology of prolonged mother-infant contact provides support for \nthe beneficial effects of bed-sharing \u2013 research data associates enhanced breast \nmilk production, increased prevalence and duration of breastfeeding, improved \ncardio-respiratory stability and oxygenation, better thermoregulation, and fewer \nepisodes of crying with regular mother-infant body contact (Trevathan and \nMcKenna 1994).  Within a western context epidemiological data have implicated \nbed-sharing as a risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome (e.g. Mitchell and \nScragg 1993), and for accidental deaths of infants in adult beds (e.g. Nakamura, \nWind et al. 1999).  Observational studies of bed-sharing death-scenes have also \nattributed negative consequences to bed-sharing scenarios (Kemp, Unger et al. \n2000).  The most recent epidemiological evidence, however, found that bed-\nsharing was not a risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome for infants <14 \nweeks if the parents did not smoke (Blair, Fleming et al. 1999). \nIn order to further investigate some of these issues we conducted a \nqualitative and quantitative anthropological study of parent-infant bed-sharing \namong a sample of 253 families with new-born infants in the north-east of \nEngland.  In this paper we focus on parents\u2019 reasons for sleeping with their \ninfants. \n \n 5\nMethods \nA sample of 253 families was recruited from N. Tees Hospital post-natal \nward following approval from the local research ethics committee.  Researchers \nvisited the ward each week from July 1998 to Feb 2000, according to a randomly \ndetermined schedule, and attempted to recruit all mothers fitting our eligibility \ncriteria (healthy infant and mother, delivered at 36+ weeks gestation).  Mothers \nwere approached individually on the post-natal ward by a female research \nassistant who verbally explained the study in general terms as an exploration of \nnight-time care-giving practices.  Mothers were briefly interviewed to ascertain \ntheir initial willingness to participate, and provided with an information sheet \nand consent form.  Those who agreed to enter the study, and returned a signed \nconsent form, were asked to provide basic demographic information, to complete \na set of seven 'sleep diaries' (nightly logs), at home, over a period of seven \nconsecutive days during their baby's first month and third month, and to \nparticipate in interviews at the end of the 1st and 3rd month.   \n \nSleep logs \nParents completed nightly logs each morning in regard to the previous \nnight's sleep.  Items included on the logs covered timing, whereabouts, and type \nof last infant feed, timing, location, and position in which infant fell asleep; \nenumeration of all the different places the infant slept in the course of the night; \ntiming of retiring and sleeping for parents; duration and frequency of bouts of \nwakefulness on part of parent(s) or infant; frequency and duration of feeding \n 6\nepisodes; identity of care-giver(s) during the night; parental tiredness; clothing \nworn by infant and bed-covers used; evening and night-time consumption of \ncigarettes or alcohol by parent(s); descriptions of unusual events, weather, \ntemperature of bedroom.  An example of the sleep logs completed in the 1st \nmonth is shown in Figure 1. The 3-month sleep logs were almost identical.  \n \nFIGURE 1 HERE \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n Sleep logs were entered to Excel, averaged across each infant within each \nage category, and tabulated for statistical analyses.  Sleep logs from 10% of \nparticipants were double entered (25\/253).  The exact percentage agreement for \ndata entry was 0.984 and the kappa coefficient (correcting for chance agreement) \nwas 0.968.  This size of kappa indicates excellent reliability in data entry (z=4.84, \np<0.00001).   \n \nInterviews \nMothers were re-contacted when their infant reached the end of their 1st \nand 3rd months of age, and arrangements were made to interview her (or both \nparents) in their home shortly thereafter. At this interview the nightly logs were \ncollected.  Interviews were conducted by trained research staff who periodically \nobserved each other's interviews to ensure internal consistency in gathering data.  \nA semi-structured format was used to allow the interview to proceed in the \nmanner of a guided conversation ensuring various topics and issues were \ncovered, while allowing participants to express opinions and volunteer items of \n 7\ninformation that they considered relevant to the discussion.  Interviewers were \ninstructed to remain neutral in all interview discussions and to draw out the \nparticipant's attitudes and practices. Interview data were entered into a database \nby the interviewer as soon as possible following the completion of the interview.  \nThe database was structured to reflect the semi-structured interview schedule \nused by the interviewer.  Interviews from 10% of participants were double \nentered (25\/253).   The exact percentage agreement for data entry was 0.966, and \nthe kappa coefficient (correcting for chance agreement) was 0.931.  This size of \nkappa indicates excellent reliability in data entry (z=4.66, p<0.00001).   \nWe used the interview database to sort and group the responses of \nparticipants into categories for analysis.  The sorting and categorising were \nconducted via an iterative process that involved repeated passes through the \ninterview database splitting and lumping categories in light of the entire range of \nparental responses to several questions \u2013 a common techniques for analysing \nsemi-structured interview data (Smith 1995).  For example, mothers were asked \nseveral questions about infant feeding \u2013 and an infant could be categorised as a \n\u2018breastfed infant\u2019 in several ways \u2013 were they ever breastfed, were they currently \nbreastfed at the time of the interview, were they breastfed for a particular length \nof time (e.g. 4 weeks or more), were they breastfed exclusively, or breastfed in \nconjunction with artificial formula (mixed feeding). An infant could also be \nbreast-milk fed (i.e. via expressed milk in a bottle, but not at the breast).  As \nfeeding type has a strong influence on infant sleep it was important for such \ncategories to be rigorously defined and participants correctly assigned in each \ninstance.  For this reason two researchers, initially working blind to one another, \n 8\nsorted and categorised the data. The two blind-categorised databases were then \nmerged, and any disagreements in categorising were reconciled via mutual \nagreement following reference back to the original interview notes.  \n \nResults \nFour-hundred and ninety-seven mothers were approached on the \nmaternity ward -- 85% (421) of which agreed to participate in the study.  \nBangladeshi and Pakistani women predominantly declined to take part, \ngenerally demurring on the basis of poor English language skills, or the necessity \nof obtaining their husband's permission, although these women did not comprise \na large portion of the sample approached, or the population as a whole (~2%).  \nWe had not anticipated that we would obtain an ethnically diverse sample in this \nresearch and planned to examine night-time care-giving practices among the \nethnic sub-populations of North Tees in a future project.  Of the 421 women who \ncompleted the initial interview 40% (168) dropped out due to failure to complete \nthe sleep logs, or to participate in one or both of the interviews.  We continued \nrecruiting until we had exceeded our target sample size of 250 participants with a \ncomplete set of data for each (final sample size = 253).  Characteristics of the \nsample who completed the study are provided in Table 1. Those mothers who \ninitially agreed to participate and then dropped out of the study differed from \nthe final sample in terms of education and socio-economic group. There was a \nsignificant association between dropping out of the study and unemployment (\u03c72 \n= 21.4, df=7, p=0.003), living in rented or temporary accommodation (\u03c72=42.76, \n 9\ndf=4, p=0.000), and lack of post-16 education (\u03c72=21.11, df=4, p=0.000). The fact \nthat many of these mothers had temporary accommodation arrangements \ndirectly accounted for their loss to the study, despite strenuous efforts to contact \nthem by telephone, letter, and personal visit to their last known address. \n \nTABLE 1 HERE \n \nDefinition of bed-sharing \nParents and infants were deemed to bed-share if the infant slept in the \nparental bed with one or both parents (at the same time the parent(s) slept), for any \nportion of a night or nights for which nightly logs were recorded.  Sub-categories \nof bed-sharing were defined (following Ball, Hooker et al. 1999) as: habitual bed-\nsharing (infant sleeps in parental bed all night every night); combination bed-\nsharing (infant sleeps in more than one place, but sleeps in parents bed for at \nleast part of night on at least 2 nights per week); occasional bed-sharing (infant \nsleeps in parents' bed once a week or less).  Numbers of families in each sub-\ncategory are shown in Table 2. Non-bed-sharing families were those where the \nparents claimed their infant never slept with parent(s) in an adult bed. \n \nPrevalence of bed-sharing \nTable 2 shows that 47.4% of the babies in the sample bed-shared with \ntheir parents at least once, for all or part of the night, during their 1st month \nsleep-diary week. We consider this to be a conservative estimate of bed-sharing \n 10\nprevalence in the neonatal period, as we are likely to have under-recorded cases \nwhere occasional bed-sharing occurred at a frequency of less than once per week.  \nNot all bed-sharing babies began bed-sharing in the first few weeks of life (see \nbelow), but the majority did so.  The mean infant age at the start of the 3-month \nsleep logs was 99.8 days, and 29.4% of babies bed-shared at least once, for all or \npart of the night, during their 3rd month sleep log week.   Fifteen (20.5%) of the \nbabies who bed-shared during the 3-month sleep logs had not bed-shared during \nthe 1-month sleep logs.  Fifty-four percent of babies bed-shared during at least \none sleep-log night during the 1st month, 3rd month, or both. With the inclusion of \nparental reporting of 'ever bed-sharing' at interviews the proportion of the \nsample that had bed-shared by the time their baby was 4 months of age was 70% \n(176\/253).   Tables 2 and 3 provide a breakdown of the proportion of habitual, \ncombination and occasional bed-sharing during the infants\u2019 first and third \nmonths of life.  \n \nTABLE 2 HERE \n \n \nBed-sharing and breastfeeding \nThe most common reason given by mothers in our sample for sleeping \nwith their infants was the ease and convenience of night-time breastfeeding \nwhen bed-sharing.  Although 49% (124\/253) of mothers breastfed or mixed-fed \ntheir infants, 65% (80\/124) of these infants who had 'ever breast-fed' slept in their \n 11\nparents' bed, while 33.3% (43\/129) of formula-fed infants did so.  For infants who \nwere breast-fed for a month or more, the association with bed-sharing was even \ngreater: 72.3% (81\/112) of these infants were bed-sharers compared to 38.3% \n(54\/141) of formula-fed infants (see Table 4).  The proportions of bed-sharing \nbabies who were regular part-night (i.e. following early feed) bed-sharers were \nvery similar -- 57\/81 (70%) of breastfeeding bedsharers did so for part-nights --- \nwhile 39\/54 (72%) of formula-fed bed-sharers followed the same pattern. \n \n________________________________________________________________________ \nTABLE 3 HERE \n \nMothers in the sample who were unprepared for the greater frequency \nwith which breastfed babies wake to feed during the night in comparison with \nformula-fed babies cited \u2018baby feeding too frequently at night\u2019 and \u2018mother needs \nmore sleep\u2019 as reasons for giving-up breastfeeding in the early weeks.  Those \nwho were committed to breastfeeding, however, and those who had experience \nwith previous children, used bed-sharing as a means to ameliorate frequent \nnight-time feeds, often commenting that when bed-sharing they barely needed to \nwake up in order to latch the baby on the breast.  In order to ascertain whether \nmothers terminated bed-sharing when they stopped breastfeeding we examined \nthe bed-sharing practices of those mothers who were breastfeeding at the time of \nthe 1st-month sleep logs, but did not continue breastfeeding past 8 weeks (i.e. \nstopped well before 3rd-month sleep logs).  Thirty-six mothers fitted these \n 12\ncriteria, 15 of whom were bed-sharing regularly at the 1st month sleep logs. By \nthe time of the 3rd-month logs when all were no longer breastfeeding, several (6) \ncontinued to bed-share regularly for part-nights, while an equal number no \nlonger bed-shared at all. The remaining 3 mothers and infants still bed-shared, \nbut now did so only occasionally. \n \nBed-sharing to settle baby -- get some sleep \nFor the 19% (47\/253) of families where bed-sharing was unrelated to \nbreast-feeding, settling a baby who was having trouble sleeping was a prevalent \n(55%: 26\/47) reason for bed-sharing, as the following examples from sleep logs \nillustrate: \n \nFamily 467: \u201cBaby appeared to have colic.  As we were unsure we rang the doctor who \nconfirmed that this is likely to be the case.  Baby slept in parents bed so we could keep an \neye on him.\u201d \n \nFamily 481 \u201cHe slept well but his cough kept waking him up a little bit so Granma \nbrought him in her bed to keep an eye on him.\u201d \n \nFamily 407 \u201cContinually twisted and turned in her sleep. Resolution: cuddled in bed with \nmum\u201d \n \nFamily 243 \u201cquite grizzly - ok when he came in bed with us - so we let him stay in bed \nwith us\u201d \n \n 13\nFamily 248 \u201cHe was coughing all night and very restless so he stayed in parents' bed\u201c \n \nFamily 280 \u201cWas cold during the night so put her in our bed and she went to sleep \u201c \n \nFamily 361 \"Baby was unsettled, brought into bed, cuddled\" \n \nIn the majority (18\/26) of these cases a baby who was unhappy at being \nput-down alone protested until the parents, desirous of sleep, allowed him into \nbed.  In 8 cases, however, the cause of the infant's distress was illness, and two \ncases \u2013 although not readily apparent at the time -- were far from benign when \nviewed retrospectively.  These two particular case studies are instructive. The \nfollowing details are summarised from the nightly logs of two families, each \npresented as a seven-night sequence describing the infants' sleep. \n \nFAMILY 123: 14 Jan 1999, Age 117 days \nPut him down at 7:15 fell asleep woke up at 7:25, picked up fell asleep put down at 8:00, \nwoke up at 8:10 fell asleep, put down again at 8:15,slept in own bed till 8:30.  Finally fell \nasleep at 9:40 for the night in our bed \n \n15 Jan, Age 118 days \nHe would fall asleep in my arms but as soon as I put him down he would wake up \u2013 \nbrought into bed \u2013 woke up 7 times, cuddled to sleep \n \n16 Jan, Age 119 days \n 14\nFell asleep in my arms, put into bed would not sleep so took him in my bed and he fell \nasleep and stayed in my bed for the night  -- woke up 6 times \n \n17 Jan, Age 120 days \nHe would not go down to sleep in his cot so he stayed in bed with me and went to sleep \nstraight away. Have just found out he has German measles. \n \n18 Jan, Age 121 days \nHe fell asleep in my arms then when I put him down he slept for 30 mins then woke up.  \nHe is still not 100% due to German measles  \n \n19 Jan, Age 122 days \nHe was very tired so I kissed, cuddled and talked to him and he fell asleep in my bed so I \njust left him there  \n \nFAMILY 417: 17th Jan 2000, 98 days \nBaby slept well all night in cot in her own room \n \n18th Jan, 99 days \nBroken sleep, in bed with mum \n \n19th Jan, 100 days \nWoke early, generally irritable, rocked in bed with mum \n \n20th Jan, 101 days \nWoke at 23:30, then on and off for most of the night. In bed with mum \n 15\n \n21st Jan, 102 days \nEar & chest infection & high temp, sleeps on and off, left downstairs & then taken to bed \nwith mum \n \n22nd Jan, 103 days \nIn bed with mum all night, slept well \n \n23rd Jan, 104 days \nIn cot in own room, slept well all night \n \nThe first set of examples from our interview data illustrate that irregular \nbed-sharing occurred when parents took babies who were irritable and were \nhaving trouble sleeping into the parental bed . The two case studies show that, \nalthough uncommon, \"twisty\" (local slang) or irritable babies who are brought \ninto bed may subsequently develop clinical manifestations of an infection.  This \nsuggests that some babies who are taken into their parents\u2019 bed when they are \nirritable or \u2018twisty\u2019 may therefore be in the prodromal phase of an illness (e.g. \nbefore the manifestation of clinical symptoms, but when the parents recognise \nthat the baby is \u201cnot him\/herself\u201d). One potential explanation for some \nunexplained bed-sharing deaths, therefore, might be that a vulnerable baby \nfacing a physiological challenge that has not yet manifested clinically, may be \ntaken into the parents\u2019 bed due to behavioural irritability, where it may succumb \nto the physiological insult. \n 16\n \nTo attend quickly to an ill baby \nEleven families described having their baby sleep in their bed during \nperiods of overt illness.  For these families this was either a means to monitor the \nbaby while s\/he was in a vulnerable state, or because the illness was causing \nirritability or distress for the infant who was calmed by close contact with a \nparent.  The situation of poorly infants sleeping in bed with their parents is \nsomewhat different from the irritable but otherwise well-seeming infants being \nbrought into bed under point 2.  In this case the parents are aware of the infant\u2019s \nillness, vigilant for signs and symptoms, and active in taking precautions \nregarding overheating etc.  In the following examples, for instance, illness is a \nprecursor to the bed-sharing event -- whereas in the examples mentioned above, \nbed-sharing preceded overt signs of illness by several days: \n  \nFamily 366 \"Baby getting flu, woke every hour, in bed with mum\" \n \nFamily 618 \"Baby slept in parents' bed. Quite restless, had his immunisations and needed \nto be close to mum and dad\" \n \nFamily 627 \"Cold and snuffles, came into bed\" \n \nParents subjectively felt that their baby was 'safer' in close contact with \nthem during the night than isolated in a cot -- they were reassured by the ease \nwith which they could hear or feel their infant breathing, monitor his\/her \n 17\ntemperature, or simply confirm his\/her presence, especially when the baby was \nill. \n \nOther bed-sharing motives \nAlthough breastfeeding, settling, and illness were the three primary \nmotivations that caused parents to sleep with their infants in this study, parents \nmentioned several other reasons during interviews or on nightly logs. \n \nFear of baby dying \/ dying alone.  Two of the mothers that we interviewed were \nextremely anxious about cot-death (SIDS), and slept with their baby in an effort \nto prevent him\/her from dying -- rationalising that should their baby experience \nany distress they would awaken and be able to provide assistance.  For another \nmother, however, it wasn't so much prevention of her baby's death that \nmotivated her to bed-share, but its circumstances.  She told of her premonition \nthat her second son was going to die in infancy.  She chose to sleep with him in \nher bed, she explained -- not because she thought she would be able to save him \nshould he die -- but to reassure herself that when he died he would not be alone.  \nThankfully her premonition did not come true. \n \n \nFor enjoyment \/ to increase time spent with baby.   Working parents who bed-shared \narticulated the pleasure of close contact at night with an infant they had to be \nseparated from during the day, and the joy of waking to their infant\u2019s smile. \nTwenty-three percent (57\/253) of mothers had returned to work by the time of \n 18\nthe 3-month interview, and 27 of these (47%) were bed-sharing \u2013 10 of whom had \nnot been bed-sharing when interviewed when their infant was 1 month old.  \nMothers who bed-shared and had returned to work were often those who had \nbegun bed-sharing due to breastfeeding, and had continued bed-sharing \nfollowing the termination of breastfeeding (12\/27).  Five further mothers \ncontinued to breastfeed at night while bed-sharing following their return to work \nduring the day.  One mother who had returned to work soon after her baby was \nborn explained that bed-sharing gave her the contact with the baby that she \nmissed through the day, \"if I sleep with the baby, I can feel close, cuddled up, \nand it somehow helps me not to feel so guilty about leaving her through the \nday\".  Similar comments came from two bed-sharing fathers in the study but for \nthem there was no involvement of guilt.  They were happy being close to their \ninfants during the night as they were away from them during the daytime.   \n \nTo ease maternal pain \/ discomfort following birth.  Several midwives were reported \nto have taught new mothers, especially mothers who had delivered via c-section, \nhow to breastfeed their infants lying down \u2013 31% (40\/136) mothers who initiated \nbreastfeeding reporting that they slept with their infants in their hospital bed. \nWhen the mothers found how easy and comfortable this feeding method was, \n73% (29\/40) of them adopted it for night-time feeding and combined it with \nregular bed-sharing. \n \n 19\nNowhere else for the baby to sleep.  In one young family we interviewed bed-sharing \nwas not so much a matter of choice, as of circumstance.  The parents were a \nteenage couple (mother 17, father 19) awaiting housing provision from the local \ncouncil.  In the meantime they were living with relatives, where they were \nprovided with a single bed.  Following the birth of their baby all 3 members of \nthe family slept together in the single bed -- baby in the crook of his mother's arm \nsqueezed between both parents.   \n \nParenting ideology: family bed.  In contrast to the young couple described above, \nsleeping arrangements in 12 families reflected a conscious and pre-planned \ndecision to bed-share, not just with an infant, but with children of all ages and, in \nsome cases, family pets too (10% [12\/119] of families with older children).  \nParents expressed their opinions that this 'family bed' ideology set the tone for a \nrelaxed and intimate family relationship, and reflected a permissive parenting \nstyle that some educated and well-off parents in our sample wished to promote.  \nUsually these families had begun sleeping with their first infant, and had \nprogressed to larger and larger beds with the arrival of each subsequent child.  It \nwasn't the case that all children in the family slept with their parents all night \nevery night, but it was clear in such families that children were welcomed into \ntheir parents' bed at whatever time of the night they might choose to visit, and \nthat they were always accommodated, no matter how many occupants the bed \nalready contained. \n \n 20\nDiscussion \nParents and infants in North Tees bed-share regularly, and for a variety of \nreasons including convenience, ideology, enjoyment, necessity and anxiety, \nhowever ease of breastfeeding is the most prominent reason given by parents for \nbed-sharing, and breastfeeding and bed-sharing are closely intertwined.  That a \nstrong and clear relationship exists between breastfeeding and bed-sharing is \nsupported by numerous studies (Ford, Mitchell et al. 1994; Mitchell, Scragg et al. \n1994; Clements, Mitchell et al. 1997; Ball, Hooker et al. 1999; Hooker, Ball et al. \n2000; McCoy, Vezina et al. 2000).  Among mothers belonging to the breastfeeding \nsupport network La Leche League, with infants aged 2 to 13 months, 60-90% were \nbed-sharers (Elias, Nicolson et al. 1986).  A recent Australian study (Rigda, \nMcMillen et al. 2000) of a small sample of socio-economically advantaged \nfamilies with a high proportion (77%) of breast feeders found, using 24-hour \nsleep diaries once per week, that 80% of infants were reported to have ever bed-\nshared with one or both parents between birth and 24 weeks of age.  Ford et al \n(1994) found an association between bed-sharing and longer duration of \nbreastfeeding in a sample of 1529 New Zealand infants and concluded that \nfurther research was necessary to determine causality (Ford, Mitchell et al. 1994). \nMcKenna, Mosko et al. (1997) and Ball (2000) have both argued that bed-sharing \npromotes breastfeeding. McKenna and colleagues demonstrated that mother-\ninfant bed-sharing doubled the number of breastfeeding episodes, tripled the \ntotal nightly duration of breastfeeding, and significantly shortened inter-feed \nintervals compared with separate sleeping for the same mother-infant pair.  Ball \n 21\nhas shown that, among mothers most likely to give-up breastfeeding, those who \nbreastfeed and bed-share continue breastfeeding for significantly longer than \nthose who breastfeed in the absence of bed-sharing (Ball 2000).  \nAlthough Byard (1998) cautions against the rare possibility of accidental \nasphyxia associated with breastfeeding related bed-sharing, breastfeeding \nmothers commonly bed-share as a means to ameliorate the sleep disruption of \nnocturnal breastfeeding (Ball, Hooker et al. 1999), thus we should expect that \nbreastfeeding mothers and infants will predominate in any population of bed-\nsharers; a fact acknowledged by the American Academy of Pediatrics in their \nmost recent position statement on bed-sharing (AAP 2000). \nBecause the profile of breastfeeding in many Western Industrialised \ncountries involves a sharp decline in the proportion of infants breastfed between \nbirth and 6 months (e.g. Foster, Lader et al. 1997; Arora 2000) we should likewise \nexpect infants in the younger age brackets (those most likely to be breastfed) to \nbe more likely to bed-share than infants in the older age brackets.  The \nrelationship between infant age and bed-sharing clearly demonstrated in the data \nfrom the current study is corroborated by Rigda et al (2000) who found a \nsignificantly greater proportion of younger infants (2-12 weeks) than older \ninfants (13-24 weeks) bed-sharing in an Australian cohort (Rigda, McMillen et al. \n2000). \nAlthough breastfed babies are likely to predominate in any sample of \nbed-sharing families, a sizeable proportion of formula-feeders (53\/113 in the \npresent study) sleep with their infants for other reasons.  Around half (27\/53) of \nthese families do so regularly (e.g. for ideological reasons, lack of space, \n 22\nenjoyment etc), whereas the remainder of parents will bring their infants in to \ntheir bed only on rare and specific occasions (e.g. infant illness or irritability, or \ntransient lack of space such as when travelling\/visiting etc).  The circumstances \nof irregular or occasional bed-sharing are such that safety considerations and \npotential risk factors might be quite different for these families than for those that \npractice regular breastfeeding related bed-sharing.  In video-observational \nstudies of mothers and infants sleeping together several researchers have begun \nto distinguish differences in the bed-sharing relationships of mothers and infants \nwhose normative practice is to sleep together compared with those who normally \nsleep separately.  Mosko et al (1997) reported that regularly bed-sharing mothers \nresponded to their infants more rapidly on bed-sharing nights than did mothers \nwho did not normally bed-share with their infants, while Young (1999) and Ball \n(2001) have found that irregularly bed-sharing mothers and non-breastfeeding \nmothers (respectively) turned their backs on their infants while bed-sharing, \nwhile regularly bed-sharing breastfeeding mothers did not.  Young (1999) also \nfound that mothers who were regular bed-sharers slept in closer proximity to \ntheir infants when sleeping together than did mothers who did not bed-share \nregularly. \nIt is clear then, that bed-sharing is not a \u201cunitary\u201d phenomenon.  \nBreastfed infants are not the only babies that bed-share and both breastfeeders \nand non-breastfeeders bed-share in a variety of different ways, and for various \nreasons.  Further research will be necessary to further elucidate the consequences \n(positive or negative) to infants of the various bed-sharing motivations reported \n 23\nhere.  Such research would, however, be valuable in the provision of advice on \nbed-sharing risks and benefits that can be tailored to individual circumstances. \n \nConclusions \n \nParents and infants in North Tees bed-share regularly, and for a variety of \nreasons including convenience, ideology, enjoyment, necessity and anxiety. \nThe primary reason for bed-sharing is ease of night-time breastfeeding, but many \nfamilies bed-share with their infants either regularly or occasionally for other \nreasons.  It should not be assumed, even within an ethnically homogeneous \npopulation, that all parents who bed-share with their infants would do so in the \nsame way, or for similar reasons. It is important, therefore, that circumstance and \nmotivation are considered in assessments of bed-sharing safety, and parental \nreasons for bed-sharing are acknowledged in formulating advice for parents \nregarding bed-sharing. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe author is grateful to Elaine Hooker, Joanne Anderson-Hawkins, \nGeraldine Hatfield, Emma Kitching and Chi Thai for their assistance in data \ncollection and data entry.
