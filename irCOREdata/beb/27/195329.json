Measurements, including total electron con-\ntent (TEC), were undertaken during the period 23\u201329 April\n2001, with the interval from 28 to 29 April 2001 being of par-\nticular interest since a magnetic storm of moderate intensity\ntook place at this time. The largest contribution to the TEC\nis typically from the F2 region. However, we know that ge-\nomagnetic storms cause both positive and negative changes\nto the peak electron density, NmF2, depending upon loca-\ntion and time within the storm. Consequently, we would ex-\npect changes in TEC during storms to be dominated by the\nchanges in F2 region density, provided the electron density\nis not simply re-distributed in altitude, although it is possible\nfor changes in E-region density to contribute as well. Thus,\ncomparisons utilizing a variety of techniques play a valuable\nrole in developing our understanding of the storm effects on\nthe total electron distribution within the ionosphere.\nAlthough we understand many of the geomagnetic storm\neffects on the F2-region (e.g. Buonsanto, 1999; Gonzales\net al., 1994; Lastovicka, 2002), a complete understanding\n1698 D. V. Blagoveshchensky et al.: Observations during a magnetic storm\nFig. 1. Map showing the locations and paths of the various HF\ninstrumentation employed in these experiments. The GPS measure-\nments fall in the range between latitudes of 40\u25e6 and 70\u25e6 N and lon-\ngitudes of 10\u25e6 W and 40\u25e6 E.\nremains elusive due to the highly variable nature of magnetic\nstorms. The storm on 28 and 29 April 2001, which is dis-\ncussed in this paper, illustrates this variability. Although both\npositive and negative phases, similar to a \u201cclassical\u201d storm,\nwere present, the main feature of this storm is the presence\nof three well-defined substorms identified in the AE index.\nThe study of the ionospheric effects of this storm interval,\ntherefore, enables us to distinguish the impact of substorm\neffects from the larger scale storm effects, and, therefore, will\ncontribute to the debate on the storm\/substorm relationship,\nwith particular reference to the effects in the mid- and high-\nlatitude ionosphere.\nThe substorm process is known to manifest itself in a va-\nriety of ways in the ionosphere, such as the initial auroral\nbrightening and subsequent expansion of the disturbed au-\nrora, the development of the ionospheric current associated\nwith the substorm current wedge, equatorward ionospheric\nconvection bursts, larger scale enhancements of westward\nflow in the pre-midnight sector. The electron density in the\nlower ionosphere is substantially enhanced, particularly in\nthe auroral zone which leads to a large increase in radio\nwave absorption in the HF band (e.g. Milan et al., 1998).\nThe enhancement of the lower ionosphere electron density is\ncaused by strongly increased precipitation of energetic par-\nticles from the magnetosphere, such that an increase in ab-\nsorption measured by an auroral zone riometer from 0.0 to\n2.5 dB is equivalent to a change in electron density at heights\nbelow 90 km of a factor of 100 or more (Lastovicka, 2002).\nWhilst the purpose of the HIRAC campaign was to make\nmeasurements of TEC (in this paper from the Euref net-\nwork of GPS stations in northwest Europe), it is necessary\nto compare such measurements with those made contempo-\nraneously with a range of other instrumentation. The purpose\nof this paper is to present HF radio measurements made with\nionosondes at St. Petersburg, and Sodankyla, oblique inci-\ndence sounders (OIS) on paths from Murmansk to St. Pe-\ntersburg (1050 km) and Inskip to Leicester (170 km), and HF\nDoppler measurements on paths from Cyprus to St. Peters-\nburg and Murmansk to St. Petersburg to support the GPS ob-\nservations. In addition, HF radar measurements were also\nmade with the CUTLASS radar located in Hankasalmi, Fin-\nland. The locations of these sites are shown in Fig. 1. Fur-\nthermore, these observations were supported by measure-\nments of solar wind parameters, the interplanetary magnetic\nfield (IMF), the Kp, AE and Dst magnetic indices, riome-\nter absorption data from the Sodankyla observatory, and data\nfrom the IMAGE magnetometer network.\nThe remainder of this paper presents an overview of the\nsolar wind and geomagnetic conditions prevailing during the\nstorm. The observations of TEC are then presented, followed\nby the HF observations. We conclude the paper with a dis-\ncussion of the observations with reference to our understand-\ning of magnetic and ionospheric storms and magnetospheric\nsubstorms.\n2 Character of the geomagnetic disturbance\nTo provide the necessary context for the following observa-\ntions we present the Dst , AE and Kp magnetic indices and\nthe IMF Bz component measured by the ACE spacecraft for\nthe interval 01:00 UT, 28 April 2001 to 23:59 UT on 29 April\n2001 (Fig. 2). As indicated by the Dst index (Fig. 2a) a\nstorm main phase commenced at approximately 13:00 UT\non 28 April 2001, following a positive phase which had be-\ngun at 05:00 UT on the same day. The main phase of the\nstorm peaked at 02:00 UT on 29 April 2001, when the Dst\nreached its minimum value, and ended at about 09:00 UT on\n29 April 2001.\nInspection of the hourly values of the IMF Bz component\n(Fig. 2b) indicates that the IMF was predominantly north-\nward until just after 15:00 UT on 28 April 2001, after which\nit remained southward for almost 15 h before turning north-\nward and remained so for the rest of the interval. The so-\nlar wind velocity and density during this interval (data not\nshown) demonstrate that a shock in the solar wind passed\nACE at \u223c04:40 UT on 28 April 2001. At this time the solar\nwind velocity increased from \u223c470 km s\u22121 to \u223c750 km s\u22121,\nthe density from 4 cm\u22123 to 10 cm\u22123, resulting in an equiva-\nlent increase in the solar wind dynamic pressure from 1.4 nPa\nto 9 nPa. This increase by a factor of 10 in pressure caused a\nD. V. Blagoveshchensky et al.: Observations during a magnetic storm 1699\nsudden impulse in the geomagnetic field at 05:00 UT on 28\nApril 2001 and was clearly responsible for the large increase\nin the hourly Dst at that time (Fig. 2a). The solar wind veloc-\nity and density remained higher than their pre-shock values\nfor much of the following interval.\nThe hourly AE index values (Fig. 2c) indicate that the\nmagnetic storm contained three pronounced substorms, num-\nbered 1, 2 and 3, when AE exceeded 500 nT. The expansion\nphase onset (To) of the first substorm was at 05:00 UT on\n28 April 2001, had a maximum AE of \u223c800 nT, and ended\n(Te) some time between 07:00 and 08:00 UT. More accu-\nrate timings from preliminary quick look 1-min values of AE\nindicate To was 05:00 UT and Te 07:00 UT. This substorm\noccurred during a prolonged interval of northward IMF and\nwas a consequence of the shock impact mentioned above.\nAfter 07:00 UT, AE remained high, typically of the order\nof 300 nT, but reasonably steady, with no impulsive changes\nindicative of substorm activity until after 12:00 UT. The sec-\nond substorm started at 13:30 UT and ended at 15:30 UT\n(based upon preliminary quick look one-minute data). This\nsubstorm had the largest value of AE of the three events,\nreaching nearly 1500 nT. A number of intervals of southward\nIMF were measured by ACE from \u223c09:00 UT to 11:00 UT,\n11:30 UT to 12:00 UT and 12:30 UT to 14:00 UT prior to\nand during the second substorm. The third and final sub-\nstorm during the storm period started at 01:00 UT on 29 April\nand finished at 04:00 UT (timings again based upon the pre-\nliminary data). This substorm occurred during a period of\nprolonged southward IMF. It is evident from Fig. 2d that the\nmain maxima of Kp coincide with the three substorm inter-\nvals, with the largest values of Kp(\u223c6) occurring during the\nsecond, most intense, substorm.\nTo summarise the geomagnetic conditions, the Dst mini-\nmum at 02:00 UT on 29 April 2001 was less than \u221250 nT,\nand Bz was less than \u22125 nT for at least two hours during the\ninterval. Therefore, according to the classification given by\nGonzalez et al. (1994), the storm is categorised as moderate.\nThe onset of the positive phase of the storm occurred follow-\ning a shock in the solar wind impacting the Earth\u2019s magneto-\nsphere, while the negative or main phase of the storm began\nsome 8 h after this. The periods 00:00\u201306:00 UT on 28 April\nand 12:00\u201323:59 UT on 29 April may be considered as either\nweakly disturbed or quiet.\n3 Ionospheric observations\n3.1 Total electron content (TEC) measurements\nGlobal Positioning System (GPS) observations provide an\nexcellent method for studying the large-scale structure and\ndynamics of the ionosphere. The total electron content\n(TEC) along the path between the satellite and the ground re-\nceiver can be determined from observations of the time delay\nof the dual-frequency (1.57 GHz and 1.23 GHz) GPS signals.\nA technique has been developed in the West Department of\nIZMIRAN that allows TEC maps over Europe to be produced\nFig. 2. Variations of geophysical parameters during a magnetic\nstorm on 28\u201329 April 2001, (a) Dst -index, (b) Bz-component of\nthe interplanetary magnetic field, (c) AE-index, and (d) Kp . The\nthree substorms that occurred during this period are marked by ver-\ntical lines and indicated as 1, 2, and 3.\nusing the GPS measurements from more than 60 stations of\nthe Euref Network (Shagimuratov, 2002). The high density\nof stations in Europe enables TEC maps to be derived with\nhigh temporal and spatial resolution between latitudes of 40\u25e6\nand 75\u25e6 N and longitudes of 10\u25e6 W and 40\u25e6 E. The error in\nthe TEC determination for the 30-s intervals of averaging\nused here does not exceed 1014 m\u22122(0.01 TEC units). This\npermits ionisation irregularities and wave processes in the\nionosphere to be monitored over a wide range of amplitudes,\nup to 10\u22124 of the diurnal variation of TEC, and periods, from\na few hours down to 5 min.\nIn Fig. 3 maps of TEC for a quiet day, 27 April 2001\n(Fig. 3, top row) and the two disturbed days of the geo-\nmagnetic storm, 28 and 29 April 2001 (Fig. 3, middle and\nbottom row, respectively) are presented. For the quiet day,\nas expected, the TEC increased through the morning hours,\nreaching a maximum close to noon, and then decreased in\nthe evening. At times (e.g. 04:00\u201308:00 UT), there was a\nstrong east to west gradient. Prior to the commencement\nof the magnetic storm (05:00 UT, 28 April 2001), the TEC\nvariations at 00:00 UT and 04:00 UT, 28 April 2001, were\nvery similar to those at the same times on 27 April 2001.\n1700 D. V. Blagoveshchensky et al.: Observations during a magnetic storm\nFig. 3. Observed TEC (bold UT values indicate a storm interval), (a) quiet day of 27 April, (b) disturbed day of 28 April, and (c) disturbed\nday of 29 April. Numbers on the scale are TEC in units of 1016 m\u22122.\nHowever, once the storm had started, there were significant\ndifferences between the quiet and disturbed days for the same\nhours. The clearest feature was the development of a deep\nand relatively narrow trough in the TEC, which can be seen\nat eastern longitudes and \u223c70\u25e6 N latitude at 16:00 UT on 28\nApril 2001. By 20:00 UT on 28 April 2001, this trough had\nmoved equatorward such that it was then centred at 65\u25e6 N lat-\nitude at 20:00 UT. At 00:00 UT on 29 April 2001, the trough\nextended across the whole map, but occurred at lower lati-\ntudes in the west and had become somewhat broader and by\n04:00 UT on 29 April 2001 it had become present only in the\nwest. Other features in the TEC following the storm onset\ninclude an increase in TEC at latitudes below 60\u25e6 N, particu-\nlarly evident at 08:00 UT on 28 April 2001, but also present\nat 12:00 UT and 16:00 UT on that day. In addition, there\nwere lower values of TEC at latitudes greater than 60\u25e6 N\nfrom 08:00 UT to 16:00 UT on 29 April 2001, although the\nlower latitude values of TEC were comparable to the quiet\nday values at this universal time. By the end of 29 April\n2001, the TEC values at all latitudes were comparable to\nthose on 27 April 2001.\nIt is instructive to also look at the TEC maps during the\nexpansion phases of the three individual substorms that oc-\ncurred during this storm (Fig. 4). During substorm 1 (Fig. 4a)\nthere was a smooth time variation in TEC with higher TEC\nin the east and an increase at all longitudes with time. Since\nsimilar behaviour was observed for quiet conditions, it ap-\npears that no significant changes to the TEC occurred during\nthis expansion phase. The only minor change is a small re-\nduction in TEC at 07:00 UT at high latitudes (>70\u25e6 N). Dur-\ning the second substorm (Fig. 4b), there were some large-\nscale irregularities and strong gradients in the TEC. For ex-\nample, there were enhancements in the TEC at 13:00 UT at\nlatitudes above 60\u25e6 N which were not present at 12:00 UT\non 27 April 2001 (Fig. 3, top row), isolated structures at\n14:00 UT, and finally, a much larger latitudinal gradient\nat 15:00 UT than was present at 16:00 UT on the quiet\nday (Fig. 3, top row). The TEC during the third substorm\n(Fig. 4c) is dominated by the trough structure and generally\nlow levels of TEC, as discussed above.\n3.2 Oblique incidence soundings for the Murmansk-St. Pe-\ntersburg path\nSeveral key parameters indicative of the HF propagation\nconditions, and hence of ionospheric conditions, were de-\ntermined from an oblique incidence sounding undertaken\nover the path from Murmansk to St. Petersburg (midpoint\ngeographic 64.5\u25e6 N, geomagnetic 60\u25e6 N). The parameters\nincluded F2MOF (maximum observed frequency for sig-\nnals reflected from the F2-layer) and F2LOF (lowest ob-\nserved frequency for signals reflected from the F2-layer).\nEMOF, ELOF, EsMOF, and EsLOF were similarly de-\nfined for signals reflecting from the E and sporadic-E-\n(Es)-layers, respectively. Here we consider sporadic-E as\nan E-layer with a higher than expected critical frequency\nD. V. Blagoveshchensky et al.: Observations during a magnetic storm 1701\nFig. 4. Observed TEC during the expansion phases of three sub-\nstorms: (a) Number 1 of 28 April, (b) Number 2 of 28 April, and\n(c) Number 3 of 29 April. Numbers on the scale are TEC in units\nof 1016 m\u22122.\nwithout distinguishing between the formation mechanisms.\nIt is likely, however, that the sporadic-E observations made\nhere are related to auroral particle precipitation. An addi-\ntional parameter, DeltaF2MOF, was defined as the deviation\nof F2MOF from the 10-day quiet median, such that negative\nvalues of DeltaF2MOF indicate that the F2MOF is less than\nthe equivalent 10-day quiet mean value. Note that the MOF\ndepends on the ionospheric electron density profile, while the\nLOF depends on the level of ionospheric absorption and on a\nrange of system parameters including the transmitter power\nand antenna gains (Milan et al., 1998).\nThe variations of the parameters defined above during the\nmagnetic storm on 28\u201329 April for the Murmansk to St. Pe-\ntersburg path are presented in Fig. 5. Figure 5a presents\nDeltaF2MOF, while Fig. 5b presents F2MOF and F2LOF.\nIn Fig. 5c, EMOF, ELOF, EsMOF and EsLOF are presented.\nThe times when propagation was by sporadic-E are indicated\nby the horizontal lines. Finally, Figs. 5d and e present the X\ncomponent from the Sodankyla observatory of the IMAGE\nmagnetometer network and the Sodankyla riometer, respec-\ntively. At the time of the first substorm there was a nega-\ntive X component bay of some 250 nT at Sodankyla, even\nthough the local time of this station was near 07:00 MLT. In-\ncreased absorption occurred at Sodankyla, but only towards\nthe end of the interval of the first substorm (Fig. 5e). Dur-\ning this substorm, vertical soundings made at St. Petersburg\nFig. 5. Oblique sounding measurements made on the path\nMurmansk-St. Petersburg during a magnetic storm of (a)\nDeltaF2MOF, (b) F-region MOF and LOF, and (c) E-region MOF\nand LOF. Measurements made at Sodankyla, Finland (near to path\nmid-point) of (d) X-component of geomagnetic field, and (e) ri-\nometer absorption A (dB) at 32 MHz.\nand Sodankyla (data not shown) indicate that the ionosphere\nwas not essentially altered. Note that Sodankyla is poleward\nand to the west of the midpoint for the Murmansk-St. Pe-\ntersburg path. For two or three hours before the onset of\nthe substorm, DeltaF2MOF increased from negative values,\nreaching a maximum positive value at To (05:00 UT). To-\nwards the end of the substorm expansion phase DeltaF2MOF\ndecreased, which was due to a decrease in the measured\nF2MOF at the time (Fig. 5b, upper panel). This was fol-\nlowed by a marked increase after Te which was a result of\na large increase in measured F2MOF. DeltaF2MOF then fell\nto zero during the following few hours. Similar behaviour of\nDeltaF2MOF during and following an isolated substorm of\nmoderate intensity was reported by Blagoveshchensky and\nBorisova (2000), Blagoveshchensky et al. (1992, 1996 and\n2003) and named the \u201cmain effect\u201d. We note that at the\npath midpoint (64.5\u25e6 N, 32\u25e6 E) the TEC values increase by\n\u223c50% from 05:00 to 07:00 UT (Fig. 4 top row), although at\n08:00 UT the TEC values at the path midpoint on 28 April\n2001 were \u223c25% less than those on 27 April 2001. The\ndecrease in F2MOF towards the end of the substorm sug-\ngests a decrease in the maximum electron density at the mid-\npoint, which is inconsistent with the increase in TEC val-\nues. Furthermore, the large positive DeltaF2MOF after Te\n1702 D. V. Blagoveshchensky et al.: Observations during a magnetic storm\nFig. 6. Oblique ionospheric measurements made on the path\nInskip\u2013Leicester, 28\u201329 April 2001, of (a) DeltaF2MOF, (b) F-\nregion MOF and LOF, and (c) E-region MOF and LOF.\nalso implies an increased density at the path midpoint, again\ninconsistent with the TEC decrease from quiet to disturbed\nvalues.\nSubstorm 2, which resulted in the largest value of the AE\nindex during this interval, was accompanied by high absorp-\ntion (Fig. 5e) and changes in the ionosphere measured by\nvertical incidence sounding at St. Petersburg and Sodankyla\n(data not shown). DeltaF2MOF was initially negative at\nthe start of this substorm and a sharp decrease occurred at\n15:00 UT. The main phase of the magnetic storm began\nat 13:00 UT when Dst and IMF Bz values were negative\n(Fig. 2), some 30 min before the onset of this substorm. Here\nthe large increase in DeltaF2MOF at the end of the substorm\nwas absent. The most likely reason for this is probably the\ndevelopment of the intense trough in ionisation which oc-\ncurred at 15:00 UT (Fig. 4, middle row). The decline in\nF2MOF and F2LOF and the subsequent increase in the nega-\ntive values of DeltaF2MOF are all associated with the trough\nthat forms across the oblique propagation path. Furthermore,\nafter 19:00 UT the propagation by the F2 path was lost due\nto the presence of the sporadic-E on the path. This was also\nthe case throughout the interval of the third substorm, which\nwas also characterised by the largest absorption values ob-\nserved by Sodankyla. This implies particle precipitation into\nthe D- and E-regions during this substorm in the vicinity of\nthe oblique propagation path.\nAfter the F2 propagation path returned at 05:00 UT on\n29 April, the DeltaF2MOF was still considerably negative,\nwhich is consistent with the weaker levels of TEC at this time\ncompared with the quiet day levels. However, from 06:00 UT\nonwards there was a steady increase in DeltaF2MOF towards\na value of zero which was finally reached at 15:00 UT. We\nalso note that after F layer propagation returned there was\nstill enhanced absorption along the path, as evidenced by the\nhigh value of F2LOF, which is consistent with the high val-\nues of the riometer absorption at Sodankyla.\n3.3 Comparison with the oblique incidence soundings for\nthe Inskip \u2212 Leicester path\nThe midpoint of the Inskip-Leicester path (170 km) is located\nat mid-latitudes (geographic latitude 53\u25e6, geomagnetic lat-\nitude 51\u25e6), although propagation can sometimes be affected\nby auroral features to the north (Siddle et al., 049, 052, 2004),\nas opposed to the subauroral path from Murmansk to St. Pe-\ntersburg (geomagnetic latitude 60\u25e6). The main results are\npresented in Fig. 6, in a similar way to those for Murmansk-\nSt. Petersburg (Fig. 5). The intervals when the three sub-\nstorms (1, 2 and 3) identified earlier occurred are also shown.\nDuring the first substorm, the \u201cmain effect\u201d occurred\nvery clearly on the Inskip to Leicester path. The rise in\nDeltaF2MOF was slightly less than on the higher latitude\npath but, nevertheless, was still significant and also occurred,\nas a result of a large increase in the F2MOF. As noted by\nBlagoveshchensky and Borisova (2000), Blagoveshchensky\net al. (1992, 1996 and 2003), the \u201cmain effect\u201d commonly\noccurs during substorms at both middle and high latitudes.\nUnlike the higher latitude path, the \u201cmain effect\u201d is also\nseen during the second substorm, although weaker and start-\ning from a higher value of DeltaF2MOF. However, again\nthe feature is caused by a rise in F2MOF. There is no such\nevidence for the \u201cmain effect\u201d during the third substorm,\nhowever, which occurred when the DeltaF2MOF was signifi-\ncantly negative. This large negative value began at 20:00 UT\non 28 April 2001 and continued until 08:00 UT on 29 April\n2001. It is clear from the TEC observations that this is a re-\nsult of the very low values of TEC during this time frame\nalong this path (Fig. 3, middle and bottom rows).\nThe behaviour of the ionization in the E-layer during the\nmagnetic storm is different at middle and high latitudes.\nThe Es-layers observed continuously at high latitudes are\nnot present at all times at middle latitudes (for example, at\n15:00 UT and 18:00 UT on 29 April). This suggests that the\nbehaviour of the E-layer during this storm was more localised\nthan the F-region storm effects.\n3.4 Doppler measurements for the Murmansk-St. Peters-\nburg path\nIn addition to the OIS operating on the Murmansk-St. Peters-\nburg path, an HF Doppler sounder (Andreev et al., 1995) was\nalso operational on the path for 3 specific intervals, 16:00\u2013\n21:00 UT, 28 April 2001, 01:00\u201310:00 UT, 29 April 2001\nand 18:00\u201323:59 UT, 29 April 2001. The first and second\nof these intervals were coincident with the expansion and re-\ncovery phases of substorms 2 and 3, respectively, while the\nthird interval occurred during the quiet period following the\nrecovery phase of the storm. The operational frequency, fop,\nD. V. Blagoveshchensky et al.: Observations during a magnetic storm 1703\nFig. 7. Sonogram for Murmansk-St. Petersburg between 16:26 and\n16:45 UT on 28 April 2001. Numbers on the colour scale are power\nspectrum values, arbitrary units.\nof this system was centred at 5.93 MHz and the bandwidth is\nbetween \u221230 and +30 Hz of this centre frequency.\nThe data from the HF Doppler sounder are in sonogram\nformat, each of which lasted for 20 min, and Fig. 7 is a rep-\nresentative example from the first of the three intervals. Uni-\nversal time increases from the bottom of the panel upwards,\nwhile the frequency axis presented here is between \u22129 Hz\nand +8 Hz of the centre frequency, which is the frequency\nrange during this interval in which there was significant re-\nceived signal amplitude. To summarise the data from the\nsonograms, Table 1 presents certain average characteristics,\nto which we refer during the following discussion.\nThree important characteristics can be identified from the\nsonograms. The width of the Doppler spectrum, 1fD (Hz),\nprovides information on the propagation mode, such that the\nsmaller this value, the less disturbed the propagation path.\nDuring quiet periods 1fD was in the range 1\u20133 Hz. This in-\ncreased during the substorm expansion and recovery phases,\nhowever, to values between 10 and 30 Hz. Figure 7, taken\nfrom the expansion phase of substorm 2, illustrates that the\nwidth at any given time is typically larger than 3 Hz, although\nthis is mainly due to the presence of extra traces in the sono-\ngram (see below). Figure 8, taken from the late expansion\nFig. 8. Sonogram for Murmansk-St. Petersburg between 05 :00 and\n05:46 UT on 29 April 2001. Numbers on the colour scale are power\nspectrum values, arbitrary units.\nphase or early recovery phase of substorm 3, illustrates a\nwidth of some 5 Hz or more. If the central frequency of\nthe Doppler sounder exceeded the MOF, either via E- or F-\nregions, then there would have been a transition from signal\nreflection to scattering from irregularities and consequently, a\nbroadening of the spectrum. For much of the first interval of\nsonogram recording (16:00\u201321:00 UT on 28 April 2001), the\noperational frequency was less than F2MOF and propagation\nwould have been via a sporadic-E mode. For the first hour of\nthe second interval, fop was greater than the propagation fre-\nquency via either the F- or E- region. These times are clearly\nillustrated by the high values of 1fD given in Table 1. Note,\nbased on the OIS data, the cases when fop are larger than the\nMOF are not accompanied by either multimode or multi-path\npropagation.\nThe second characteristic that can be identified from the\nsonograms are wave disturbances which cause a change in\nthe central frequency of the propagation mode as a result of\nsmall changes in the reflection height of the signal. The wave\nperiod (Tw) and amplitude fDmax (Hz) can be identified from\nthe sonogram. Two types of waves are known to cause such\nchanges in the reflection height. ULF waves, or geomagnetic\n1704 D. V. Blagoveshchensky et al.: Observations during a magnetic storm\nFig. 9. Sonogram for Cyprus-St. Petersburg between 02:00 and\n02:46 UT on 29 April 2001. Numbers on the colour scale are power\nspectrum values, arbitrary units.\npulsations, have periods typically in the 10-s range. Atmo-\nspheric gravity waves result in travelling ionospheric distur-\nbances (TIDs) and these have longer periods, typically in the\nseveral minutes range. On the Murmansk to St. Petersburg\npath, the periods that were seen were characteristic of ULF\nwaves. Longer period gravity waves were seen on a lower lat-\nitude path between St. Petersburg and Cyprus (Fig. 9). Gen-\nerally, under quiet conditions, waves of both types were ab-\nsent.\nThe third and final characteristic that can be determined\nfrom the sonograms is the presence of additional modes of\npropagation which is indicated by the presence of additional\ntraces. The amplitude of the frequency deviation from the\ncentre frequency in Hz of these additional traces is given in\nTable 1 and found to vary from \u221210 to +18 Hz, depending\non time. These additional traces (see, for example, Fig. 7)\nwere only found during the expansion phase of the substorm\nor immediately afterwards.\nThe results obtained have shown that the Doppler spec-\ntra on the high-latitude Murmansk-St. Petersburg path are\nalways relatively broad. The broad spectra can arise either\ndue to scatter from ionospheric irregularities or from addi-\ntional traces due to different propagation modes. This proba-\nbly implies a highly-structured ionosphere on this path under\ndynamic substorm conditions.\n3.5 Doppler measurements for the Cyprus-St. Petersburg\npath\nFor the Cyprus-St. Petersburg path (9410 kHz and\n12095 kHz), the variations of Doppler spectra at 9410 kHz\nare well correlated with those on 12 095 kHz. Furthermore,\nray-tracing calculations showed that the point of reflection\nof the wave with a frequency 9410 kHz in the F2-layer of\nionosphere was about 22 km lower than the point of reflec-\ntion of the wave with a frequency 12 095 kHz. Therefore,\nonly sonograms for 9410 kHz signals will be presented here.\nA sonogram taken during the expansion phase of substorm\nNumber 3 (02:00 to 03:00 UT on 29 April 2001) for this\npath is presented in Fig. 9. Here the Doppler width 1(fD) is\n\u223c 4 Hz and there are wave disturbances with a quasi-period\n(Tw) of 30 min and amplitude (fDmax) 2 Hz, but, as with the\nMurmansk \u2212 St. Petersburg path at this time, there are no\nadditional traces indicating only one propagation mode. The\nwave processes are likely to be medium-scale travelling iono-\nspheric disturbances (TIDs). From the Doppler measure-\nments in Fig. 9, it is possible to estimate some values of the\nTID parameters. According to Afraimovich (1982), tenta-\ntive estimates of the wave disturbance amplitude M, the low\nborder of horizontal wavelength, 3, the velocity of the wave\nscreen movement, or TID phase velocity, V, and the intensity\nof disturbance of electron concentration, relative amplitude\nof a wave disturbance, \u03b4, can be obtained from the following\nM =Tw \u00b7 (fDmax) \u00b7 \u03bb \u00b7 (1\/2pi),\n3=2pi \u00b7 Zo \u00b7 (M\/2Zo)1\/2,\nV=3\/Tw,\n\u03b4=M\/2Zo,\nwhere Tw is the period of the wave disturbance, fDmax is the\nwave amplitude as measured by the Doppler sounder, \u03bb is\nthe wavelength of the HF radio wave, and Zo is the height of\nreflection.\nIf we take Zo as 250 km, and \u03bb as 32 m and the val-\nues of the parameters from Fig. 9 are Tw=30 min, and\nfDmax=2 Hz, then we obtain estimates for M of 18 km,\n3=300 km, V=167 m\/s, \u03b4=3.6\u00d710\u22122. These values are sim-\nilar to those obtained by other observation methods (Stocker\net al., 2000).\nFrom Fig. 7, the ionospheric velocity near the signal re-\nflection position is determined by the equation (Afraimovich,\n1982)\nV=(\u03bb\u00b7fDmax)\/2\u00b7cos\u03c6,\nwhere \u03c6 is the wave incidence angle on the ionosphere.

It was\nfound that the width of the Doppler spectra on the mid-\nlatitude path was significantly narrower than on the higher-\nlatitude path for all examined events. Also, the TID parame-\nters estimated from the sonograms are typical medium-scale\nTID values and are similar to previous observations (e.g.\nStocker et al., 2000 and references therein). We cannot, how-\never, in this instance, identify the source of the TIDs.\n3.6 Observations by the CUTLASS radar\nThe two CUTLASS radars (Lester et al., 1997), one located\nin Iceland and one in Finland form the eastern pair of radars\nof the Northern Hemisphere element of the Super Dual Au-\nroral Radar Network, SuperDARN (Greenwald et al., 1995).\nThe CUTLASS radars have a common observing volume\nover and to the north of Scandinavia. A combination of the\nmeasurements from the two radars enables the ionospheric\nconvection velocity vector perpendicular to the Earth\u2019s mag-\nnetic field to be determined. During the interval of interest,\nhowever, observations in the vicinity of the Murmansk-St.\nPetersburg path are limited to the Finland radar.\nThere were three main intervals of ionospheric backscat-\nter during the storm interval. The first of these was from\n05:30 UT to 10:30 UT and consisted of scatter from the F-\nregion at the far ranges of the radar is field of view, i.e. at\nmuch higher latitudes than we are interested in here. There-\nfore, we do not consider this scatter further in our discus-\nsion. The other two intervals are of scatter from the E-region\nand occurred close to the mid-point of the Murmansk-St. Pe-\ntersburg path. The data in Fig. 10 are from 12:00 UT on\n28 April to 11:00 UT on 29 April, which corresponds to the\nmost disturbed part of the magnetic storm described above\n(Figs. 2 and 5). The geographic latitudes indicated in Fig. 10\nrange from 60\u25e6, which corresponds to that of St. Petersburg,\nto 69\u25e6, corresponding to Murmansk. Note that the Han-\nkasalmi radar is located at 62\u25e6 latitude. The data from beam\n15 of the Hankasalmi radar can approximately be compared\nwith Doppler and OIS measurements on the Murmansk-St.\nPetersburg path, as it is directed northward and is approx-\nimately parallel to but displaced in longitude by about 3\u25e6\nfrom the Murmansk-St. Petersburg path. In Fig. 10, the ex-\npansion phases of substorms Number 2 and Number 3 are\nindicated by the vertical lines, and the times at which the\nDoppler records presented in Figs. 7\u20139 are also indicated on\nFig. 10.\nThe top panel in Fig. 10 illustrates the ionospheric\nbackscattered power. Prior to 14:00 UT on 28 April, no\nionospheric scatter was observed. However, during sub-\nstorm 2, there was an interval when intense irregularities\nwere concentrated near the midpoint of the Murmansk-St.\nPetersburg path on \u03c6=64.5\u25e6. These irregularities disappeared\n1706 D. V. Blagoveshchensky et al.: Observations during a magnetic storm\nFig. 10. Ionospheric scatter observed by CUTLASS Finland radar\nduring a magnetic storm 28\u201329 April, (a) power, (b) velocity, and\n(c) spectral width.\nafter the end of the expansion phase of substorm 2. During\nsubstorm 3, there was a larger region of less intense radar\nbackscatter.\nThe Doppler velocity of the irregularities responsible for\nthe ionospheric scatter is shown in the middle panel of\nFig. 10. The first patch of scatter had Doppler velocities\nwhich were typically less than 200 m s\u22121 away from the\nradar. Investigation of the data on the other radar beams dur-\ning this interval indicates that the Doppler velocity was neg-\native on all beams, with the larger values in the west of the\nfield of view. This is consistent with an overall westward ve-\nlocity in this region. Comparison with TEC maps in Figs. 2\nand 3 indicates that the irregularities occurred at latitudes at\nthe equatorward gradient in TEC associated with the trough\nwhich formed following the onset of the main phase of the\nstorm. The second interval of scatter had Doppler velocities\nwhich tended to be weakly negative. Although highly vari-\nable, the nature of the velocities on the other beams is con-\nsistent with the eastward flow at this time.\nE-region irregularities tend to fall into two types: those\ncaused by the two stream instability and those which are gen-\nerated by the gradient drift instability (Hunsucker and Harg-\nreaves, 2003). Normally the former have Doppler veloci-\nties which saturate at the local ion acoustic speed, typically\nbetween 300 m s\u22121 and 400 m s\u22121 in the auroral ionosphere\nand small values of spectral width. Conversely, irregulari-\nties generated by the latter mechanism have velocities which\nare lower than the ion acoustic speed and have larger spectral\nwidths. During the first interval, the spectral widths tend to\nbe large, suggesting that they were generated by the gradient\ndrift instability. During the second interval, when the scatter\nwas much weaker, there was a mixture of large and small val-\nues of spectral width. Comparison with the TEC maps again\nindicates that the scatter occurred close to a gradient in TEC\nbut a much weaker one on this occasion.\n4 Physical interpretation of obtained results\n4.1 Current understanding\nThe current understanding and recent advances in the study\nof ionospheric storms have been reviewed in many publi-\ncations (e.g. Buonsanto, 1999; Gonzales, 1994; Lastovicka,\n2002). It is known that ionospheric storms result from large\nenergy inputs to the upper atmosphere associated with geo-\nmagnetic storms. The latter occur during unusually disturbed\nconditions in the solar wind, often related to an interplane-\ntary shock impacting the magnetosphere but always requiring\nan extended interval of southward IMF. The energy inputs\nto the upper atmosphere take the form of enhanced electric\nfields, currents, and energetic particle precipitation. Strong\nelectric fields combine with increased conductivities result-\ning from energetic particle precipitation to give substantial\nelectric currents and consequently strong Joule heating of the\natmospheric gases. There is also frictional heating due to\ncollisions between the plasma accelerated by the large elec-\ntric fields and the ambient neutral gas. Either way, the neu-\ntral gas is heated, creating pressure gradients which modify\nthe global thermospheric circulation. There are changes in\nneutral air winds and composition which result in changes\nto rates of production and loss of ionization. The modified\nelectron densities, in turn, modify the ion drag on the neu-\ntrals. Disturbed neutral winds also cause F-region electric\nfields by the disturbance dynamo mechanism. These electric\nfields redistribute the plasma, affecting production and loss\nrates. Storm-related electric fields may also destabilize the\nplasma, producing irregularities.\nRapid expansion of the neutral atmosphere due to heat-\ning at high latitudes may cause upwelling, i.e. the motion\nof air through constant pressure surfaces. Enhanced equa-\ntorward winds transport the composition changes to lower\nlatitudes, so that one can see a \u201ccomposition disturbance\nzone\u201d of increased mean molecular mass reaching from high\nto middle latitudes. The equatorward winds often take the\nform of traveling atmospheric disturbances (TADs) when the\nheating events are impulsive. They manifest themselves in\nthe ionosphere as large-scale traveling ionospheric distur-\nbances (TIDs). Equatorward of this zone, poleward neutral\nwinds may occur and convergence of these winds results in\ndownwelling which decreases the mean molecular weight at\nD. V. Blagoveshchensky et al.: Observations during a magnetic storm 1707\nconstant pressure levels. A decrease in the mean molecular\nmass would lead to increases in NmF2 and TEC while an in-\ncrease in the mean molecular mass due to upwelling leads to\ndecreases in NmF2 and TEC. A rise in the F2 peak height to a\nregion of reduced loss due to equatorward winds would also\nproduce increases in NmF2. Similarly, a drop in hmF2 due\nto poleward winds reduces NmF2. As a result of the local\ntime variation of winds at middle latitudes, negative iono-\nspheric storm effects are most often seen in the morning sec-\ntor and positive storm effects in the afternoon and evening.\nWhen NmF2 or TEC perturbations are studied according to\nstorm time, i.e. time from onset of the disturbances, the typ-\nical storm shows an initial positive phase followed by a neg-\native phase, with the duration and strength of the two storm\nphases, depending on latitude and season (Buonsanto, 1999).\n4.2 28\u201329 April 2001 magnetic storm origin\nThe moderate geomagnetic storm discussed in this paper is\nunusual in a number of respects. The positive phase of the\nstorm, i.e. when Dst is positive, is unusually long, starting as\na result of the shock impact at 05:00 UT and lasting for 7 h,\nduring which time the IMF was predominantly northward.\nOnly after the IMF turned southward did the main phase of\nthe storm begin.\nThe second unusual aspect of this storm is that it consisted\nof 3 major, but separate substorms, where major is defined\nhere as an interval where AE exceeded 500 nT. Larger storms\noften result in a number of substorm activations but it is\nnot simple to separate them in terms of the typical substorm\nphases. The first of the three substorms was unusual in itself.\nTo start with the expansion phase onset was coincident with\nthe sudden impulse caused by the shock impact. Investiga-\ntion of the AL and AU indices revealed that the contribution\nto the initial rise in AE was from the AU index rather than\nthe AL index which is the case for normal substorms. The\nAL index does subsequently make the largest contribution\nto the AE index, after 05:30 UT, and there was a secondary\nintensification in AE at 06:30 UT which was a result of a\nrapid change in AL. Furthermore, the substorm was initiated\ndespite there being no significant interval of southward IMF\nfor many hours prior to the onset. Compressions of the mag-\nnetosphere as a result of enhanced solar wind pressure have\nrecently been seen to cause a major change in the particle\nprecipitation into the auroral zones and hence the size and\nshape of the auroral oval (e.g. Boudouridis et al., 2003).\nThe onset of the main phase of the storm was 13:00 UT\nwhich was some 30 min prior to the onset of the second sub-\nstorm. This substorm did have several intervals of southward\nIMF prior to the expansion phase onset, at 13:30 UT, and\ntherefore did have a true growth phase. The expansion phase\nwas the most disturbed of the three, in terms of amplitude of\nAE and also lasted the longest. The final substorm occurred\nat the peak of the main phase and following this event the\nstorm appears to have started its recovery phase.\nTo summarize, the storm consisted of 3 separate sub-\nstorms, the first of which was caused by the shock in the solar\nwind impacting on the magnetosphere. The second substorm\nwas responsible for the onset of the negative phase of the\nmagnetic storm, while the storm recovery phase began at the\nend of the third substorm.\n4.3 Delta F2MOF and TEC variations\nThere are two separate measures of the changes in iono-\nspheric electron density presented in this paper. The maps\nof TEC covering a geographic latitude range from 40\u201375\u25e6 N\nand a geographic longitude range from \u221210 to 40\u25e6 E, based\non GPS measurements, are the first measure. The propa-\ngation frequencies on two paths, one at high latitudes Mur-\nmansk to St. Petersburg, and one at mid latitudes, Inskip to\nLeicester, are the second, since F2MOF is equivalent to the\nmaximum electron density at the path midpoint, assuming a\nsingle hop propagation.\nThe TEC maps demonstrate two key results. Firstly, some\n3 h after the onset of the storm, the TEC at mid latitudes had\nincreased by some 50% or more above the quiet day level\nand this remained the case until 16:00 UT. Note, however,\nthat there appeared little change in TEC during the expan-\nsion phase of the first substorm. The increase in ionization\nat mid latitudes was probably the result of upwelling of ion-\nization at high latitudes which is then transported equator-\nward by the interaction with neutral winds. This seems to\nhave occurred during an interval of strong ionospheric cur-\nrents, notably indicated by the AE, AL and AU indices, but\nnot necessarily electric fields, since the IMF remained north-\nward during this initial part of the storm. Therefore, current\nflow at high-latitudes caused heating and upwelling, result-\ning in dynamical and composition changes which ultimately\nled to higher densities at mid-latitudes. The time scale for\nthis process was of the order of 2 h, which is approximately\nthe length of the expansion phase of the first substorm.\nThe second feature in the TEC maps is a deep ionization\ntrough which formed at higher latitudes and was clearly vis-\nible at 15:00 UT (Fig. 4, middle row) but may have been\npresent at higher latitudes than could be measured before\nthis time. These results are confirmed by the estimates of\nNmF2 based upon the F2MOF observations. On the mid lat-\nitude path the DeltaF2MOF was positive from 08:00 UT to\n18:00 UT, while at higher latitudes, although positive from\n08:00 UT to 12:00 UT, it remained negative thereafter. The\ntrough is most likely to have been the result of high elec-\ntric fields, following the southward turning of the IMF. This\nis demonstrated by the fact that there was an equatorward\nmotion of the trough with time, which would have been due\nto the equatorward motion of the ionospheric convection as\nthe southward IMF took hold, as well as the rotation of the\nviewing area to later magnetic local times. The CUTLASS\nobservations in Fig. 10 do indicate that the westward flow did\npick up near 64\u25e6 N at 13:30 UT and inspection of the other\nradars demonstrate strong westward flows at higher latitudes\nwhich did appear to move equatorward in this time frame.\nFinally, there appears to be a discrepancy following sub-\nstorm 1 between the TEC observations and the DeltaF2MOF\n1708 D. V. Blagoveshchensky et al.: Observations during a magnetic storm\nfrom the St.Petersburg-Murmansk path, where the TEC ob-\nservations indicate an decrease at the path midpoint while\nDeltaF2MOF indicates an increase. Since TEC integrates\nthe total number of electrons along the path from receiver to\ntransmitter and the DeltaF2MOF is dependent only upon the\nlocal plasma frequency at the reflection location (path mid-\npoint for 1 hop propagation), it is perhaps not surprising that\ndiscrepancies do exist. Re-distribution of plasma with al-\ntitude, which is likely under these circumstances could be\nthe reason for these discrepancies but further detailed stud-\nies would be required, including knowledge of the maximum\nelectron density at the path mid-point.\n4.4 The \u201cmain effect\u201d\nThe ionospheric effect of an isolated substorm has been doc-\numented elsewhere (Blagoveshchensky and Borisova, 2000;\nBlagoveshchensky et al., 1992; Blagoveshchensky et al.,\n1996; Blagoveshchensky et al., 2003). This effect, referred to\nas the main effect, can be summarized as the following tem-\nporal variation of Delta foF2, an increase some 6\u20138 h before\nthe expansion phase onset, followed by a decrease until the\nend of the expansion phase, after which there is another in-\ncrease. Only isolated substorms with a sharp onset to the ex-\npansion phase and a duration of not more than several hours\ndemonstrate this effect (see references above).\nThe enlargement of Delta foF2 values at high and middle\nlatitudes before a substorm onset is a result of lifting the F2\nlayer (or hmF2) caused by the vertical drift. The latter arises,\nfirstly, due to the electric field origin and, secondly, due to\nthe meridional equatorward winds. One can see the \u201cmain\neffect\u201d for Delta F2MOF on Figs. 5 and 6.\nIn the first substorm, the effect is seen clearly at both mid\nand high latitudes, in particular the sharp rise at the end of\nthe expansion phase onset. In the second event, the effect is\nseen only at mid-latitudes as a result of the trough in TEC\nimpacting upon the propagation at high latitudes. However,\nsince the main effect is only associated with substorms which\nare isolated, then we conclude that the first two substorms\ncan be considered isolated in the sense of their impact on the\nionosphere. This demonstrates, therefore, that the storm not\nonly had large-scale effects but also the smaller scale effects\nwhich are normally seen during smaller substorms. This fur-\nther supports the view that this storm was the result of sev-\neral substorms adding together separately. In addition, the\ncause of the lack of the \u201cmain effect\u201d on the two paths is\ndifferent. On the high-latitude path, there is significant ab-\nsorption which does not allow the HF signal to propagate via\nthe F-region, while at the lower latitudes, the path mid-point\nis within the TEC trough and consequently, no propagation\npath can be established.\n5 Conclusions\nDuring the High Rate GPS\/GLONASS measuring campaign\n(HIRAC), simultaneous experimental measurements were\nmade, some results of which are presented here. The nature\nof the experimental campaign, involving a range of different\nradio techniques, such as GPS, oblique incidence sounding,\nvertical incidence sounding, HF Doppler, and an HF coherent\nscatter radar, CUTLASS, provides an entirely different way\nof looking at the ionospheric storm effects. In addition, we\nnote that the magnetic storm responsible for the ionospheric\neffects, which is classified as moderate, is relatively unusual\nin that it consists of 3 separate individual substorms, the first\nof which is triggered by the compression in the solar wind.\nThe main results and conclusions can be summarised as\nfollows:\n1. The GPS observations of TEC demonstrate the forma-\ntion of a well-defined trough following the southward\nturning of the IMF. This was most likely caused by\nthe enhanced electric fields associated with the south-\nward turning and subsequent equatorward expansion of\nthe ionospheric convection pattern. This trough im-\npacted the observations on the high-latitude path of the\n\u201cmain effect\u201d during the second substorm. This demon-\nstrates the importance of the multi-diagnostic experi-\nmental campaign.\n2. The TEC observations also indicated an enhancement\nin TEC at lower latitudes, some 2\u20133 h after the storm\nonset. This enhancement is most likely a result of\nthe enhanced currents which were present at the time\nin the high-latitude ionosphere. These currents cause\nheating and upwelling, altering the composition and the\nwind field, also generating atmospheric waves, and re-\ndistributing plasma to lower latitudes where it increases\nthe TEC.\n3. The \u201cmain effect\u201d on ionospheric propagation during\nsubstorms was observed during the first 2 substorms on\nthe mid-latitude path and during the first substorm on\nthe high-latitude path. This observation is in accordance\nwith previous observations of this effect, which gen-\nerally occur during isolated substorms. As mentioned\nabove, the trough in TEC appeared to impact on the ob-\nservation of the main effect as did the absorption on the\nhigh-latitude path during the third substorm. We also\nnote the presence of the main effect in association with\nthe first substorm, which was unusual, apparently being\ntriggered by a magnetospheric compression.\n4. At the time the trough was present within the CUT-\nLASS Finland radar\u2019s field-of-view, the ionospheric ir-\nregularities present were clearly co-located with a gradi-\nent in the TEC. Although the irregularities responsible\nfor the ionospheric scatter observed by the radar were\nlikely to be in the E-region, the coexistence of the TEC\ngradient and the irregularities is of direct interest to un-\nderstanding the physical mechanism for the generation\nof these irregularities. This study demonstrates the po-\ntential for such overlapping data sets.\nD. V. Blagoveshchensky et al.: Observations during a magnetic storm 1709\n5. The results are chiefly in a good agreement with the\npicture of our current understanding of physical pro-\ncesses which develop during a magnetospheric storm.\nHowever, the mechanism which causes the ionospheric\n\u201cmain effect\u201d is not simply explained and there is a ne-\ncessity for further study of this problem.\n6. The behaviour of the oblique sounding characteristics\non the subauroral Murmansk\u2013St. Petersburg path were\nprimarily determined by ionospheric variations leading\nto changes in the radio propagation and by the level of\nabsorption in the lower ionosphere. The propagation\nbehaviour at high and mid latitudes was similar when\nthe signal was reflected from the F2-layer, but different\nwhen the signal was reflected from the E-layer.\n7. The Doppler spectral width is at a maximum (10\u201330 Hz)\nduring the substorm expansion and recovery phases,\nwhile under the quiet conditions the width is 1\u20133 Hz.\nThe spectral broadening is probably associated with the\npresence of ionospheric irregularities during disturbed\nconditions and also depends to a degree on the propaga-\ntion mode. The wave disturbances observed during the\nsubstorm expansion and recovery phases were found to\nhave periods between 2 and 30 min. Under quiet con-\nditions, wave disturbances were usually observed. The\nparameters of the medium-scale travelling ionospheric\ndisturbances (TID) derived from the measurements are\nsimilar to those previously reported. Additional tracks\non sonograms are not observed during the expansion\nphase of a substorm or immediately after it, while at\nother times the tracks are absent.\nAcknowledgements.
