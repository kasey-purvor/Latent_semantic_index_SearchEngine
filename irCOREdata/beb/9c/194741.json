Introduction\n[2] Studies of coherent plasma and magnetic structures\nobserved in the solar wind downstream of the Earth suggest\nthat the magnetosphere can extend several hundred, or\neven thousand, planetary radii in the antisunward direction\n[e.g., Wolfe et al., 1967; Ness et al., 1967; Intriligator et al.,\n1979; Slavin et al., 1983]. Similar observations \u00015 AU\ndownstream of Jupiter indicate that long magnetic tails are\nan inherent property of planetary magnetospheres [e.g.,\nLepping et al., 1982; Kurth et al., 1982]. Such tails are\nclearly also highly dynamic features which vary greatly in\nlength with time, as suggested by studies which show that\non occasions the Earth\u2019s tail can terminate inside of 200 RE\n[e.g., Fairfield et al., 1996]. This paper investigates the\ntemporal variation of the length of a magnetotail.\n[3] Two main mechanisms have been proposed for the\nformation of these tails, both involving magnetic\nreconnection. In the \u2018\u2018planetary wind\u2019\u2019 or Vasyliunas cycle\nmodel [e.g., Michel and Sturrock, 1974; Hill et al., 1974;\nVasyliunas, 1983], reconnection in the nightside magneto-\nsphere allows the release of centripetally unstable plasma\nfrom closed magnetic field lines; this escaping plasma is\nconstrained to travel antisunward owing to the solar wind\nconfinement of the magnetosphere on the dayside, which\nresults in a structured wake downstream of the planet.\nAlternatively, the formation of an extended magnetotail\nhas long been recognized as a consequence of reconnection\nbetween the interplanetary and planetary magnetic fields\nand the subsequent draping of open field lines by the flow\nof the solar wind [Dungey, 1961, 1963, 1965; Cowley,\n1991], as represented schematically in Figure 1. Reconnec-\ntion in the magnetotail subsequently closes the Dungey\ncycle and releases these extended field lines back to the\nsolar wind. For instance, Dungey [1965] estimated that\nthe Earth\u2019s magnetotail would be \u00011000 RE in length, the\ndistance field lines are stretched at a solar wind speed of\n450 km s\u00021 if they remain open for 4 hours during their\nconvection cycle. Cowley [1991] further predicted the\npresence of a \u2018\u2018disconnected\u2019\u2019 tail that might extend up to\n5 times this distance.\n[4] At Earth, the Dungey cycle dominates, as a conse-\nquence of the strong interaction between the terrestrial and\ninterplanetary fields. On the other hand, the Vasyliunas\ncycle is thought to dominate at Jupiter owing to the rapid\nrotation of the planet, coupled with the high (\u0001103 kg s\u00021)\nmass outflow rate of iogenic heavy ions from the inner\nmagnetosphere. It is probable, however, that the Dungey\ncycle also contributes to the formation of the Jovian tail\n[e.g., Cowley et al., 2003]. At Saturn it is thought that the\nVasyliunas and Dungey cycles operate on a more equal\nbasis [e.g., Cowley et al., 2004].\n[5] In this paper we present a simple model of the\nDungey cycle contribution to the downwind profile of open\nand disconnected flux within a magnetotail. This model\nallows the nominal length and flux content of the Dungey\nmagnetotail (hereafter just \u2018\u2018magnetotail\u2019\u2019) to be calculated\nbased on a knowledge of the size of the ionospheric polar\ncap and the past history of the dayside reconnection rate.\nNew techniques have recently been developed which allow\nthe instantaneous size of the terrestrial polar cap to be\nmeasured [Milan et al., 2003, 2004], which in conjunction\nwith the model presented here will allow the instantaneous\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 109, A07210, doi:10.1029\/2004JA010397, 2004\nCopyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/04\/2004JA010397\nA07210 1 of 11\nstate of the Earth\u2019s magnetotail to be determined on a case-\nby-case basis.\n2. Magnetotail Model\n[6] Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of the\nEarth\u2019s magnetosphere, a cut through the noon-midnight\nmeridian. The solar wind flowing at a speed VSW from the\nleft, embedded within which is the interplanetary magnetic\nfield (IMF), compresses the dayside terrestrial magnetic\nfield to a stand-off distance of \u000110 RE. Depending on the\norientation of the IMF, magnetic reconnection between the\noppositely directed terrestrial and interplanetary magnetic\nfields at A, B, or B0 results in \u2018\u2018open\u2019\u2019 field lines (dark\nshaded region) which interconnect the solar wind with the\nplanet, threading the ionospheric \u2018\u2018polar cap\u2019\u2019; these regions\nare also known as the northern and southern tail \u2018\u2018lobes.\u2019\u2019\nSubsequent reconnection between oppositely directed fields\nat a nightside X-line at C in the central plane of the tail\nproduces \u2018\u2018closed\u2019\u2019 field lines (inner light shaded region),\nconnected to the Earth\u2019s surface at both ends. The transport\nof open flux from the dayside to the nightside owing to the\nantisunward flow of the solar wind is now known as the\nDungey convection cycle [Dungey, 1961, 1963] and results\nin the formation of a magnetotail of length \u00011000 RE\n[Dungey, 1965]. There is also a \u2018\u2018disconnected\u2019\u2019 tail, which\ncomprises the highly kinked solar wind field lines newly\nreconnected at C. It is now thought that reconnection can\ntake place at two locations in the magnetotail: at a \u2018\u2018distant\u2019\u2019\nX-line \u0001150 RE downtail during quiet times [e.g., Slavin et\nal., 1985], and a \u2018\u2018near-Earth\u2019\u2019 X-line during substorms near\n20\u201330 RE [e.g., Siscoe and Cummings, 1969; McPherron\net al., 1973; Russell and McPherron, 1973]. The only tail\nX-line that is of importance to this study is the one that is\nactively reconnecting open lobe field lines, and in the rest of\nthis paper tail reconnection is considered as a single process.\n[7] The dayside and nightside reconnection processes are\ntime-dependent and independent of each other, and so the\nproportion of the terrestrial magnetic field that is\ninterconnected with the IMF, that is \u2018\u2018open,\u2019\u2019 is determined\nby the competition between the opening of flux at the\nsubsolar magnetopause and the closure of flux in the\nmagnetotail [e.g., Coroniti and Kennel, 1972; Siscoe and\nHuang, 1985; Cowley and Lockwood, 1992; Russell, 2000;\nMilan et al., 2003, 2004]. The amount of open flux FPC\nwhich threads the ionospheric polar cap (or equally the\nwhole surface of the \u2018\u2018connected\u2019\u2019 magnetosphere) is gov-\nerned by the following statement of Faraday\u2019s Law:\ndFPC t\u00f0 \u00de\ndt\n\u00bc FA t\u00f0 \u00de \u0002 FC t\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere FA is the rate of creation of open flux at the low-\nlatitude dayside magnetopause, or the voltage along the\ndayside X-line at A in Figure 1, and FC is the rate of\ndestruction of open flux in the tail, or the voltage along the\nFigure 1.

As will be discussed later,\nthe rate and location of reconnection on the magnetopause is\ncontrolled by the orientation of the IMF; on the nightside\nreconnection is thought to occur primarily during sub-\nstorms. Typically, 5\u201310% of the 8 GWb of magnetic flux\nassociated with each hemisphere of the Earth might be open\nand map into the magnetotail lobes, though this has been\nshown to vary between as little as 2.5% and as much as 12%\nin just a few hours [Milan et al., 2003]. Undoubtedly, the\nopen flux content of the magnetosphere can increase\nsignificantly beyond this latter estimate during extreme\nloading conditions. However, it is not so much the amount\nof open flux in the system that determines the length of the\nmagnetotail but how long it has existed. The distance\ndowntail that each open field line extends depends upon the\nelapsed time since reconnection at the magnetopause and\nthe speed of the antisunward solar wind flow. The oldest\nopen field line determines the overall length of the\nconnected tail, with successively younger field lines exiting\nthe magnetotail at ever-shorter downtail distances, as shown\nschematically in Figure 1. The field lines threading the\nmagnetopause and neutral sheet (D and E) have purpose-\nfully been shown at irregular intervals to reflect the fact that\nthe flux leaving or entering the tail depends on the past\nhistory of dayside and nightside reconnection (at A and C),\nrespectively. These arguments can be used to determine the\nprofile of magnetic flux within the tail.\n[8] We first discuss the creation of new open flux by\nreconnection at the low-latitude magnetopause (A in\nFigure 1b), which occurs when the IMF has a southward\ncomponent, Bz < 0 nT, and the destruction of open flux\nduring substorms (C); these two processes determine the\noverall structure of the tail. As will be shown later, lobe\nreconnection occurring at the high-latitude magnetopause\n(B in Figure 1c) [see also Russell, 1972; Cowley, 1981] for\nBz > 0 nT can also be included, though this represents only a\nperturbation to the system. We consider four open magnetic\nfield line topologies which are created by reconnection,\nillustrated in Figures 1b and 1c. The first we call\n\u2018\u2018connected, Bz-negative\u2019\u2019 or c\u0002, which are field lines\nopened by reconnection at A; Northern and Southern\nHemisphere polar cap field lines connect into the solar wind\nto the north or the south of the Earth, respectively. Field\nlines disconnected from the Earth by reconnection at C are\nlabeled d0; these cross the central plane of the tail (AF) and\nultimately pass out through the magnetopause to both the\nnorth and the south some distance downtail, as indicated in\nFigure 1a. When the IMF is directed northward, reconnec-\ntion at B takes a preexisting open c\u0002 field line and creates\ntwo new field topologies: \u2018\u2018connected, Bz-positive\u2019\u2019 or c+\nand \u2018\u2018disconnected, Bz-positive\u2019\u2019 or d+. Figure 1c shows a\nNorthern Hemisphere c+ field line at the instant of its\ncreation, connecting the northern polar cap with the solar\nwind to the south of the Earth by draping over the nose of\nthe magnetopause. Depending on the east-west component\nof the IMF, the draped portion of this field line will\nsubsequently be carried around to the dawn or dusk flank\nof the magnetosphere within the magnetosheath flow. At the\nsame time, the other end of the preexisting c\u0002 field line is\ndisconnected to form a d+ field line, which both enters and\nexits across the northern magnetopause. A similar schematic\ncould be drawn for field lines created by reconnection at B0.\nNote that all c+, c\u0002, or d0 field lines point into the\nmagnetosphere at the northern magnetopause, with the\nsituation reversed in the south; d+ field lines, on the other\nhand, point both into and out of the magnetopause.\n[9] In the formulation that follows, we assume that the\noverall length of the magnetotail, expected to be \u00011000 RE,\nis sufficiently large that the dayside and nightside recon-\nnection sites (A, B, and C) can be considered to be located\nat x = 0. In this paper, x is downtail distance, such that x =\n\u0002X RE, where X has its usual meaning in the GSM or GSE\ncoordinate systems. We also formulate the model solely in\nterms of polar cap flux FPC and dayside reconnection rate\nFA and remove the necessity to know the nightside recon-\nnection rate FC. The latter is difficult to quantify, whereas it\nwill be shown that FA can be estimated from upstream solar\nwind conditions. In principle, FC can then be inferred from\nFPC and FA through equation (1).\n[10] The model defines the flux content of the tail F at a\ndowntail distance of x as the flux penetrating the plane\nperpendicular to the central axis of the tail (e.g., ZZ0 in\nFigure 1) to either the north or the south of the equatorial\nplane of the magnetosphere (AF, Figure 1), that is ZE or\nZ0E. We consider the northern and southern lobes separately,\nas their flux content can differ if the rate of lobe reconnec-\ntion at B or B0 has been unequal in the past (see section 2.3).\nAny contribution to the tail flux from closed field lines (i.e.,\nearthward of C) is neglected, as stated explicitly by our\nassumption that the nightside reconnection site lies at x = 0\n(see above). We calculate, at any instant in time t, the x\nprofile of the flux content F(x, t). At any particular x, some\nof this flux might be open, that is part of the connected tail\nFCT(x, t), with the rest being disconnected FDT(x, t).\n2.1. Connected Tail\n[11] Consider a volume defined by the plane ZE located\nat some downtail distance x, a parallel plane displaced\nfarther downstream by a distance dx, the neutral sheet AF,\nand the tail magnetopause. As div B = 0, any difference\nbetween the flux crossing the two vertical planes (defined\nabove as the tail flux content) must be accounted for by the\namounts of flux leaving the volume through the magneto-\npause and entering through the neutral sheet, which in turn\nare related to the past rates of reconnection at A and C,\nrespectively. For the connected tail we need count only the\ncontribution from the magnetopause, as no flux threads the\nboundary between the connected and disconnected tail.\n[12] Some time Dt after creation at A, newly opened field\nlines (c\u0002) have been carried downtail by a distance x =\nVSWDt, where they cross themagnetopause and enter the solar\nwind (D). A high reconnection rate FA results in a dense\nbundle of field lines penetrating the magnetopause, whereas a\nperiod of FA = 0 gives rise to a region of the magnetopause\nover which no field lines cross. That is, the amount of flux\ncontained within the tail decreases with increasing length x, at\na rate determined by the past rate of dayside reconnection. By\nextension of equation (1) and recognizing that dx = VSW dt,\nthis can be represented for a specific time t as\n@F x; t\u00f0 \u00de\n@x\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nMP\n\u00bc \u0002 1\nVSW\nFA t \u0002 Dt\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc \u0002 1\nVSW\nFA t \u0002 x=VSW\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f02\u00de\nA07210 MILAN: A SIMPLE MODEL OF THE DISTANT MAGNETOTAIL\n3 of 11\nA07210\nwhere this has been labeled MP to identify it as the rate of\nloss of flux across the magnetopause. For simplicity we\nassume that VSW is constant. At the earthward end of the tail,\nx = 0, the amount of open flux in the connected tail FCT (x =\n0, t) is just that threading the polar cap, FPC (t). By\nintegration, the open flux remaining in the tail at any\nparticular x and t is given by\nFCT x; t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc FPC t\u00f0 \u00de \u0002 1\nVSW\nZx\n0\nFA t \u0002 x=VSW\u00f0 \u00dedx: \u00f03\u00de\nWe define the length of the connected tail LCT as the\ndistance downstream that the oldest open field line has been\nswept, such that FCT(x = LCT, t) = 0, or in other words\nZLCT\n0\nFA t \u0002 x=VSW\u00f0 \u00dedx \u00bc VSWFPC t\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f04\u00de\nany flux leaving the tail downstream of x = LCT is associated\nwith the disconnected tail. Thus to first order, the length of\nthe connected magnetotail and the profile of open flux\nwithin it can be found from equations (2)\u2013(4), using\na knowledge of the present size of the polar cap FPC(t)\nand the past history of low-latitude dayside reconnection\nFA(t \u0002 Dt).\n[13] Figure 2a shows these concepts in schematic form\nfor the northern tail lobe (a similar figure could be drawn\nfor the southern lobe, with the magnetic field directions\nreversed). The top panel shows FCT(x, t) as a function of\ndowntail distance x at some particular time t. For de-\nscriptive purposes the x-axis has been divided into three\nsections I, II, and III, representing elderly, middle-aged,\nand juvenile portions of the tail, respectively. Thin\narrowed lines represent Northern Hemisphere c\u0002 lobe\nfield lines penetrating the polar cap (black box) at x =\n0 and exiting the tail at a downstream distance governed\nby the time elapsed since reconnection, numbered in\nchronological order of creation. The curve of FCT can\nbe thought of as the tail magnetopause, and the FCT = 0\nline can be thought of as the boundary between the lobe\nand the disconnected plasma sheet; in this case the top\nand bottom of the polar cap, marked A and C, map to the\ndayside and tail reconnection sites. The middle panel\nshows the past history of IMF Bz, from the present time\nt at the left, backward in time to the right, such that field\nlines carried downstream to x are lined up with the IMF\nconditions that pertained at the time of their creation t \u0002\nx\/VSW. Now tail sections I and III relate to intervals when\nBz < 0 nT and II when Bz > 0 nT. The bottom panel then\nshows the corresponding rate of flux transfer FA (the rate\nof creation of new open field lines) at the low-latitude\nreconnection site A, which we have assumed for simplic-\nity is zero when Bz > 0 nT and is positive and\nproportional to jBzj when Bz < 0 nT (see section 3).\nThe rate of decrease of FCT at x is, then, related to the\nflux transfer rate at t \u0002 x\/VSW. The effect of nightside\nreconnection can be thought of as a reduction of FPC\n(equation (1)), resulting in a uniform decrease in the\nvalue of FCT at all x (equation (3)). Another way of\nthinking of this is that the horizontal axis moves upward\nat a rate FC(t), effectively removing the oldest field lines\nfrom the connected tail and shortening it.\n2.2. Disconnected Tail\n[14] In a similar manner, it is straightforward to determine\nthe amount of flux in the disconnected tail (d0 field lines),\nthis being dependent on the past history of tail reconnection\nand the speed at which disconnected field lines propagate\nantisunward down the tail. In the case of the connected tail\nlobe, we determined the flux content by considering the rate\nat which flux leaves the tail by crossing the downtail\nmagnetopause. For the disconnected tail we must consider\nFigure 2. (a) A schematic of the method used to calculate\nthe open flux content of the connected tail, assuming that\nthe lobe reconnection rate is zero. All field lines included in\nthe schematic are of c\u0002 topology (see text for details).\n(b) Similar to Figure 2a, showing the inclusion of a nonzero\nlobe reconnection rate. Dashed and dotted lines indicate\nc+ and d+ field lines, respectively.\nA07210 MILAN: A SIMPLE MODEL OF THE DISTANT MAGNETOTAIL\n4 of 11\nA07210\nin addition the amount of d0 flux that crosses the neutral\nsheet from one side to the other (point E in Figure 1).\nSimilarly to equation (2), we can write\n@F x; t\u00f0 \u00de\n@x\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nNS\n\u00bc 1\nVPS\nFC t \u0002 x=VPS\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f05\u00de\nwhere NS stands for neutral sheet and VPS is the tailward\npropagation speed of disconnected field lines in the plasma\nsheet. Again for simplicity, we assume that VPS is a constant\nwith downtail distance, though this is unlikely to be the case\nin practice. The total flux at any given point in the tail can\nthen be represented as\nF x; t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc FPC t\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe\nZx\n0\n@F x; t\u00f0 \u00de\n@x\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nNS\n\u00fe @F x; t\u00f0 \u00de\n@x\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nMP\n\u0003 \u0004\ndx \u00f06\u00de\nor\nF x; t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc FPC t\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 1\nVPS\nZx\n0\nFC t \u0002 x=VPS\u00f0 \u00dedx\n\u0002 1\nVSW\nZx\n0\nFA t \u0002 x=VSW\u00f0 \u00dedx; \u00f07\u00de\nthe disconnected tail terminates at x = LDT such that F(x =\nLDT, t) = 0. This represents the point at which the field\nlines in the plasma sheet have caught up with their solar\nwind ends (F in Figure 1). The amount of flux in the\ndisconnected tail is simply\nFDT x; t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nF x; t\u00f0 \u00de \u0002 FCT x; t\u00f0 \u00de\nF x; t\u00f0 \u00de\n9=\n;\nx < LCT\nx > LCT\n: \u00f08\u00de\nWhereas the amount of flux in the connected tail decreases\nmonotonically with downtail distance, FDT(x, t) will in\ngeneral first increase before subsequently decreasing. The\nincrease is due to the release of newly reconnected field\nlines from C. The decrease can be thought of as the overall\nstraightening of the disconnected field lines as they\napproach F, which results in a reduction in the amount\nof flux that penetrates the plane perpendicular to the\ncentral axis of the tail. We should note that LDT provides\nonly a very loose definition of the \u2018\u2018length\u2019\u2019 of the tail, and\nthere will continue to be signatures of a magnetic wake\nfarther downstream of LDT. For instance, field lines can\novershoot at point F and for a while assume the opposite\ncurvature. Such reverse curvature field lines are implicitly\npredicted by the model, being represented by negative\nvalues of F(x, t) beyond LDT (see also discussion in\nsection 3). Of course, the evolution of field lines in this\nvery distant portion of the magnetotail will depend\nultimately on the behavior of VPS with x.\n[15] To find F(x, t) or FDT(x, t), it is necessary to know\nthe history of nightside reconnection FC, in addition to\nthe size of the polar cap FPC and the history of dayside\nreconnection FA (equation (7)). In principle, knowing the\nlatter two allows the former to be inferred from equation (1).\nIntegration and manipulation of equation (1) yields\n1\nVPS\nZx\n0\nFC t \u0002 x=VPS\u00f0 \u00dedx \u00bc FPC t \u0002 x=VPS\u00f0 \u00de \u0002 FPC t\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00fe 1\nVPS\nZx\n0\nFA t \u0002 x=VPS\u00f0 \u00dedx; \u00f09\u00de\nwhich can be substituted into equation (7) to give\nF x; t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc FPC t \u0002 x=VPS\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 1\nVPS\nZx\n0\nFA t \u0002 x=VPS\u00f0 \u00dedx\n\u0002 1\nVSW\nZx\n0\nFA t \u0002 x=VSW\u00f0 \u00dedx: \u00f010\u00de\nNow F(x, t) (from which FDT(x, t) can also be found) is\ndetermined solely in terms of FPC and FA. Unfortunately,\nhowever, the history of polar cap size FPC(t \u0002 x\/VPS) must\nnow be known, which did not appear in the expression for\nFCT(x, t) (equation (3)). The ramifications of this will be\ndiscussed in section 3.\n2.3. Lobe Reconnection\n[16] Although sections 2.1 and 2.2 demonstrate how the\ndownwind profile of open and disconnected flux within the\nmagnetotail can be determined to first order by considering\nonly reconnection occurring at the low-latitude magneto-\npause and in the tail, here we consider the second-order\nperturbation introduced to this by high-latitude magneto-\npause reconnection (B in Figure 1c), which occurs when\nBz > 0 nT. This process does not create new open flux; it\nonly \u2018\u2018recycles\u2019\u2019 old open field lines [e.g., Russell, 1972;\nCowley, 1981; Reiff and Burch, 1985], in that it takes open\nc\u0002 field lines which already stretch some distance downtail\nand effectively brings their solar wind end (D) back to the\npoint of reconnection (B), converting them to a c+ topology.\nThose portions of the field lines that used to reside within\nthe more distant tail are disconnected and become d+. (For\nthe purposes of the present model we discount the possi-\nbility that simultaneous lobe reconnection in both hemi-\nspheres can lead to the dayside closure of open flux.) This\nprocess of lobe reconnection can be represented as a\nremoval of c\u0002 flux threading the distant tail magnetopause\nand a readdition of an equal amount of c+ flux threading the\nnear-Earth tail magnetopause, such that the rate of flux loss\nthrough the magnetopause becomes\n@F x; t\u00f0 \u00de\n@x\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nMP\n\u00bc \u0002 1\nVSW\nFA t \u0002 x=VSW\u00f0 \u00de \u0002 1\nVSW\nFB t \u0002 x=VSW\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00fe 1\nVSW\nF0A t \u0002 x=VSW\u00f0 \u00de: \u00f011\u00de\nIn equation (11) the first term of the right-hand side\nrepresents c\u0002 field lines created at A, as in equation (2), or\nin other words the first-order profile of the tail. The second\nterm represents field lines brought back to the dayside by\nlobe reconnection, that is the creation of c+ field lines. The\nA07210 MILAN: A SIMPLE MODEL OF THE DISTANT MAGNETOTAIL\n5 of 11\nA07210\nthird term indicates the associated removal of c\u0002 flux from\nthe more distant tail by the act of converting this to\ndisconnected d+ flux. Of course, c\u0002 flux is only removed\nfrom the far tail (third term) if lobe reconnection has\noccurred to recycle it (second term); this is represented as\nF0A t \u0002 x=VSW\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nFA t \u0002 x=VSW\u00f0 \u00de\n0\n9>=\n>;\nZx\n0\nFB t \u0002 x=VSW\u00f0 \u00dedx >\nZx\n0\nF0A t \u0002 x=VSW\u00f0 \u00dedx\nZx\n0\nFB t \u0002 x=VSW\u00f0 \u00dedx \u00bc\nZx\n0\nF0A t \u0002 x=VSW\u00f0 \u00dedx\n:\n\u00f012\u00de\n[17] Equation (11) represents the sum of c\u0002, c+, and d0\nfield lines crossing the magnetopause. The flux content of\nthe connected (c\u0002 and c+) and disconnected (d0) tails can\nbe found as before in sections 2.1 and 2.2 by substituting\nequation (11) in place of equation (2). The d+ contribution\nto the tail flux content can be found by integration of the last\ntwo terms of the right-hand side of equation (11). Including\nthe perturbation associated with lobe reconnection, the\nlength of the connected tail (equation (4)) can be reformu-\nlated as\nZLCT\n0\nFA t \u0002 x=VSW\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe F0A t \u0002 x=VSW\u00f0 \u00de \u0002 FB t \u0002 x=VSW\u00f0 \u00de\n\t \n\ndx\n\u00bc VSWFPC t\u00f0 \u00de: \u00f013\u00de\nIn general this will be less than the value of LCT calculated\nfrom equation (4) by an amount dependent on the past rate\nof lobe reconnection.\n[18] These ideas are shown schematically in Figure 2b.\nThe variation of IMF Bz and FA are the same as in Figure 2a,\nthe difference being that lobe reconnection at a (low) rate\nFB is assumed to occur when Bz > 0 nT. The first-order\nstructure of the tail is as before (first term of the right-hand\nside, equation (11)). Lobe merging, when it occurs during\ninterval II, takes place with those field lines most recently\ncreated by low-latitude reconnection during interval I, first\n60 then 50, those field lines which thread the dayside lobe\nand which stretch only some short distance downtail (see\nalso Figure 1c). The reconnection process relinks these field\nlines such that they now exit the tail much nearer the\ndayside (6 then 5) and are converted to c+ topology\n(indicated as dashed lines); these exit the magnetopause in\nthe same manner as c\u0002 field lines but are then draped over\nthe dawn or dusk flank of the magnetotail to interconnect\nwith the northerly directed IMF to the south of the tail. The\nother portions of the recently relinked field lines (50 and 60,\nshown dotted) are now of d+ topology, contained entirely\nwithin the solar wind, though they will probably remain tail-\nlike as they are carried downstream. Each of the two pairs of\nc+ and d+ field lines shown crossing the magnetopause in\nsection II can be thought of as the two ends of a northward\nIMF field line reconnected, as shown in Figure 1c. The\nresult of this process is that field lines now leave the\nmagnetotail in section II (second term of the right-hand side,\nequation (11)), where previously they did not (Figure 2a),\nand fewer connected field lines exit the magnetotail in\nsection I (third term of the right-hand side, equation (11)).\nIn short, the first term of the right-hand side of equation (11)\ndescribes the original shape of the tail (Figure 2a), and the\nsecond and third terms represent the removal of the quadri-\nlateral unshaded portion of the tail (Figure 2b) that is now\ndisconnected (d+). As the removal of flux must be equal from\nboth sections I and II, that is, the same number of d+ field\nlines cross the magnetopause in each section, this means that\nthe integrals (the areas under the curves) of F0A and FB must\nequal, as required by equation (12).\n[19] In this formulation of the perturbation introduced by\nlobe reconnection one simple assumption has been made.\nThe addition of new open flux to the tail by low-latitude\nreconnection and its removal by tail reconnection can be\nthought of as a first-in-first-out system: each first newly\ncreated open field line must propagate through the tail to the\nneutral sheet before it is closed. On the other hand, when\nflux is recycled by lobe reconnection, it is the last newly\nopened field line which participates, as this lies near the\nhigh-latitude magnetopause. This represents a last-in-first-\nout system. We must assume that this \u2018\u2018last-in\u2019\u2019 field line,\nwhen recycled by lobe reconnection, is no longer next in\nline for recycling. This happens in practice owing to the\n\u2018\u2018stirring\u2019\u2019 of the lobe convection cell; that is, recently\nrecycled field lines are transported away from the recon-\nnection region due to IMF By-related tension forces related\nto the draping of c+ field lines over the flanks of the tail\n[Reiff and Burch, 1985]. The shortcomings of our assump-\ntion will be discussed later.\n3. Two Examples\n[20] The above discussion suggests that the flux in the\nconnected tail can be determined from a knowledge of\n(1) the current size of the polar cap, (2) the past history of\nlow-latitude magnetopause reconnection, and (3) the past\nhistory of lobe reconnection. Investigation of the dis-\nconnected tail requires that either the history of the polar\ncap size or the nightside reconnection rate is also known. In\nthe case of the connected tail, it is not necessary to know the\npast or present rate of reconnection in the tail, FC, as this is\nrelated to points 1 and 2 through equation (1). The size of the\npolar cap (point 1) can be found from ionospheric observa-\ntions as discussed byMilan et al. [2003, 2004]. The last two,\npoints 2 and 3, can in principle be determined from upstream\nsolar wind and IMF measurements. For the purposes of\nthe present discussion, we employ the formulation\nfirst proposed by Levy et al. [1964] and reused by\nHolzer and Slavin [1979] that the low-latitude dayside\nreconnection rate is given by the GSM Y-component of\nthe solar wind electric field integrated across a charac-\nteristic scale length LA:\nFA \u00bc\nESWLA\n0\n9=\n;\nBz < 0\nBz > 0\n; \u00f014\u00de\nwhere\nESW \u00bc \u0002VSWBz: \u00f015\u00de\nA07210 MILAN: A SIMPLE MODEL OF THE DISTANT MAGNETOTAIL\n6 of 11\nA07210\nLA represents the effective length of the low-latitude\nmerging gap or reconnection X-line when the solar wind\nflow is propagated through the bow shock and magne-\ntosheath and onto the magnetopause. Another way to think\nof this is through a reconnection efficiency factor h such\nthat LA = hLMSP, where LMSP \t 30 RE is the crosswind scale\nsize of the dayside magnetosphere. Later we will deduce\nvalues of LA of 5\u20138 RE, indicating that h \t 0.2.\n[21] We extend this idea to determine the rate of lobe\nreconnection:\nFB \u00bc\n\u0002ESWLB\n0\n9=\n;\nBz > 0\nBz < 0\n; \u00f016\u00de\nwhere the minus sign has been introduced to keep the\nreconnection rate positive. Equations (14) and (16) require\nthat FB = 0 if FA > 0 and vice versa, as the reconnection\ngeometries available on the dayside magnetopause usually\nexclude the possibility that high-latitude and low-latitude\nreconnection can occur together. It is expected that the\neffective length of the lobe-merging gap will be somewhat\nsmaller than for the low-latitude X-line, that is LB < LA.\nAlso, the rate of lobe reconnection will depend crucially on\ndipole tilt and the Bx component of the IMF; lobe\nreconnection is favored in the summer hemisphere and for\nBx < 0 nT or Bx > 0 nT in the Northern and Southern\nHemispheres, respectively [e.g., Reiff and Burch, 1985].\nUnlike low-latitude reconnection, in which the rate of\nopening of flux in both hemispheres is necessarily equal, the\nscale size LB can differ between hemispheres and may be\nzero in one or other (i.e., at B or B0, in Figure 1).\n[22] Two previous studies of Milan et al. [2003, 2004]\nemployed observations from Polar UVI, SuperDARN, and\nDMSP, FAST, and NOAA satellites to determine the vari-\nation in the size of the Northern Hemisphere polar cap\nduring 8-hour intervals on 5 June and 26 August 1998.\nThese determinations are used to illustrate the model\ndescribed above. The variations in open flux during these\ntwo intervals are shown by grey lines in Figures 3c and 3h.\nAlso shown, by vertical dashed lines, are the onsets of\nsubstorms or significant nightside auroral brightenings,\nat which times tail reconnection might be expected to\ncommence.\n[23] These measurements of FPC can be used to calibrate\nthe dayside reconnection rate estimated from the solar wind\nelectric field. Figures 3a and 3f show the variation of the Bz\ncomponent of the IMF as measured by the Wind spacecraft\nand appropriately lagged to the magnetopause for the two\nintervals; as the history of the reconnection rate is impor-\ntant, 24 hours are shown in each case, with the interval\ncorresponding to the polar cap observations highlighted in\ngrey. From this measurement and that of the solar wind\nspeed (not shown, though close to 360 and 600 km s\u00021 in\nthe two examples, respectively), FA can be computed from\nequations (14) and (15), for a given value of LA. Then, when\nthe nightside reconnection rate can be assumed zero, FC =\n0, as for instance during isolated substorm growth phases,\nequation (1) allows the expected variation of FPC to be\nfound from FA. It is found that the rate of increase of FPC is\nwell predicted if values of LA of 8 RE and 5 RE are employed\nfor the two intervals, respectively. FA so calculated is shown\nin Figures 3b and 3g, and predictions of the corresponding\nincrease of FPC are superimposed in Figures 3c and 3h (see\nsolid portions of dark curves; these are times when the\nnightside reconnection rate is assumed to be zero). The\nreason for the difference in LA for the two intervals is not as\nyet clear, though it is presently under investigation. Despite\nthis, we can use these values to calculate FA not only during\neach interval of interest but also for the preceding few hours\nto provide the past history of the dayside reconnection rate\nrequired by the magnetotail model.\n[24] Following substorm onset, FPC tends to decrease,\nclearly indicating that FC is nonzero at these times. Al-\nthough the magnetotail model does not require a knowledge\nof FC, we estimate that here for completeness. We assume\nthat following each onset, tail reconnection progresses at a\nuniform rate for a given length of time (see variation of FC\nin Figures 3b and 3g) such that the prediction of FPC from\nequation (1) matches as closely as possible the observed\nvariation (see dotted portions of dark curves in Figures 3c\nand 3h). During the seven episodes of tail reconnection in\nthese two examples, the rate varies between 45 and 200 kV\nand the duration ranges from 30 to 100 min.\n[25] The variations of FPC and FA can then be used as\ninputs for the connected tail model described in section 2.1.\nAt this stage the influence of lobe reconnection has been\ndiscounted, that is, LB has been set to zero; in this case the\nmodel predicts solely the existence of c\u0002 and d0 field lines.\nThe results of this analysis are indicated in Figures 3d and\n3i. These show the quantity of open flux contained in each\nmagnetotail lobe as a function of downtail distance and of\ntime. In the near-Earth tail the open flux content equals that\nthreading the polar cap, FPC. At ever-greater downtail\ndistances the amount of open flux decreases; the end of\nthe connected tail, the point at which the open flux goes to\nzero, is marked by the last contour.\n[26] These model results show that the connected tail can\nvary considerably in length over a few hours. In the first\ncase this ranges between 400 and 1300 RE, whereas the\nvariation is even larger in the second example, between 400\nand nearly 4000 RE. There is no straightforward relationship\nbetween polar cap size and magnetotail length; despite\nsimilar values of FPC at the start of the two intervals, the\ntail length is considerably different in each case. The length\ndepends rather on the age of the oldest open field lines.\nIndeed, the tail shortens dramatically during periods of rapid\ntail reconnection, that is after each substorm onset, as at\nthese times the oldest open field lines become disconnected\nfrom the Earth. During periods when no nightside recon-\nnection occurs, the magnetotail continues to grow in length\nat the speed of the solar wind flow. The difference between\nthe length of the tail in the two examples can be accounted\nfor by the difference in the dayside reconnection rates in the\npreceding hours. In the first example, the IMF was consist-\nently directed southward between 0200 and 0700 UT\n(Figure 3a). This suggests a period during which consider-\nable polar cap expansion might be expected. However, the\npolar cap is observed to be only of typical size, indicating\nthat a correspondingly high rate of tail reconnection must\nhave occurred. In this case, then, the oldest open field lines\nwill only be of modest age. In contrast, prior to the second\nexample, IMF Bz is small and fluctuates about 0 nT,\nsuggesting little polar cap expansion. However, the polar\nA07210 MILAN: A SIMPLE MODEL OF THE DISTANT MAGNETOTAIL\n7 of 11\nA07210\ncap is again of typical size, so little nightside reconnection\nhas occurred, and consequently the oldest open field lines\nmust be rather mature, stretched to great length by the flow\nof the solar wind. The difference between the tail lengths in\nthe two examples is also further accentuated by the higher\nsolar wind flow speed in the second example. These two\ncases are contrasted in Figure 4a, which shows the profiles\nof the open flux within the tail at 0930 UT during the first\nexample (solid curve) and 0430 UT during the second\nexample (dashed curve). Although both tails start with\nsimilar amounts of open flux at x = 0, the decrease in flux\nwith downtail distance is much more rapid for the first\nexample owing to enhanced dayside (and hence nightside)\nreconnection in the preceding hours. It is worth noting that\nit takes almost 12 hours to stretch field lines to a length of\n4000 RE at a solar wind speed of 600 km s\n\u00021.\n[27] The lower panels of Figure 4 indicate the expected\neffect of lobe merging. These model predictions are rather\nFigure 3. The magnetotail model applied to two examples, 8 hour intervals from 5 June and 26 August\n1998.

That is, there is no way to calibrate the rate\nof lobe reconnection from observations of polar cap area.\nAs noted above, owing to the differing geometries of a lobe\nmerging X-line LB might vary from 0 to a small fraction of\nLA. For illustrative purposes we select a value of LB =\n0.75 RE (that is approximately 15% of LA in our second\nexample). The most useful period that can be considered is\nafter 0800 UT in the second example, when the polar cap is\nvery contracted and the IMF has a very large northward\ncomponent Bz \t 15 nT so that the lobe reconnection rate\nmight be expected to be high; for the value of LB selected\nthis amounts to FB \t 30 kV. Figures 4b, 4c, and 4d show\nthe expected tail profile at 0800, 0900, and 1000 UT, with\nor without the inclusion of the lobe merging effect (solid\nand dashed lines, respectively). (For completeness we also\nshow the d0 disconnected flux, dot-dashed line; the end of\nthis line represents the disconnected horizon, as discussed\nbelow. We do not explicitly show the d+ flux contribution,\nbut this is represented by the difference between the solid\nand dashed curves.) We consider the predictions without\nlobe merging first (dashed curves). As FA and FC are\npredicted to be close to zero during this period, the three\nprofiles indicate solely a stretching of all open field lines\nconstituting the tail, at the solar wind speed of 600 km s\u00021,\nthat is by approximately 700 RE in 2 hours. In the case\nwhere lobe merging is included, however, although the\namount of flux in the tail at x = 0 does not vary, there is\na deflation of the more distant tail as old open field lines are\n\u2018\u2018recycled\u2019\u2019 and effectively rejuvenated, converted to c+ and\nd+ field lines. The deflation of the tail extends to farther and\nfarther downtail distances as older and older field lines are\nreconnected at the lobe-merging site (described as a last-in-\nfirst-out system in section 2.3). Figure 4d illustrates a\nshortcoming of the present model: the rate of lobe merging\nis sufficiently high that in less than 2 hours all of the open\nflux in the tail has been recycled (0.2 GWb of open flux will\nbe recycled in approximately 110 min at a lobe merging rate\nof 30 kV). This is not expected to happen in practice, as the\noldest open field lines are unlikely to participate in lobe\nmerging, or in other words, lobe convection cells are usually\nconfined to the dayside polar cap. During extended periods\nwhen the lobe merging rate is high and the polar cap is very\ncontracted, it might be expected that each open field line\nwhich participates in lobe reconnection could be recycled\nmore than once; that is, the lobe convection cell could\ncirculate several times. During such intervals a more\nsophisticated version of equation (11) is needed.\n[28] Despite this drawback, Figures 4b and 4c illustrate\nthe interesting situation in which the northern and south-\nern magnetotail lobes can display a considerable asym-\nmetry. Although the amount of open flux in each lobe at\nx = 0 is necessarily equal, the distance downtail that this\nopen flux stretches depends on the past rate of lobe\nreconnection in the two hemispheres. If this is different,\nfor instance zero in the winter hemisphere (dashed\ncurves) and nonzero in the summer hemisphere (solid\ncurves), then it is to be expected that the downtail\nsummer hemisphere lobe will contain less open flux than\nthe winter lobe. Moreover, after subsequent tail recon-\nnection has removed the oldest open field lines, the\nwinter tail lobe could be longer than the summer lobe.\n[29] Finally, we turn our attention to the disconnected tail\n(d0), predictions of which are shown in Figures 3e and 3j, in\na similar format to Figures 3d and 3i; again, the effect of\nlobe reconnection is discounted. As noted earlier, these\npredictions require a knowledge of the history of the size\nof the polar cap. This is a serious limitation of the model.\nTime series of upstream solar wind conditions tend to be\ncontinuous, providing an unbroken history of the dayside\nreconnection rate for the connected tail model. Time series\nof polar cap size FPC tend to be much more limited in\nextent, as, for instance, in the two examples presented here.\nNo prediction of disconnected tail flux can be made farther\ndownstream than the distance newly disconnected field\nlines have been carried at a speed VPS since the start of\nthe measurements of FPC. This introduces a horizon to the\nmodel, represented in the figure by a diagonal dot-dashed\nline.\nFigure 4. (a) A comparison of the profile of open flux in\nthe connected tail at 0930 UT, 5 June and 0430 UT,\n26 August 1998 (solid and dashed, respectively). In these\nexamples no disconnected flux exists earthward of the\ndisconnected horizon (see text for details). (b) A compar-\nison of the open flux content of the tail at 0800 UT,\n26 August 1998 with (solid) and without (dashed) lobe\nreconnection perturbation included.

(c and d) As Figure 4b\nexcept for 0900 and 1000 UT, respectively.\nA07210 MILAN: A SIMPLE MODEL OF THE DISTANT MAGNETOTAIL\n9 of 11\nA07210\n[30] Disconnected field lines are added to the tail at the\nnightside X-line during episodes of tail reconnection; these\nfield lines extend from x = 0 to the end of the connected tail\n(which itself simultaneously decreases in length as its eldest\nand longest field lines are disconnected). Subsequently, the\nsolar wind ends continue to propagate downtail at a speed\nVSW whilst the plasma sheet ends propagate faster, so as to\ncatch up, at a speed VPS. In these examples we use VPS =\n2VSW to exaggerate the differing influences of solar wind\nand plasma sheet propagation (Cowley [1991] suggested\nVPS = 1.2VSW). Although the present model does not\ndistinguish between near-Earth and distant reconnection\nX-lines and thus cannot predict the existence of self-\ncontained magnetic islands or \u2018\u2018plasmoids\u2019\u2019 ejected down\nthe tail during substorms, these contracting disconnected\nfield lines can be thought of in the same way. It is possible\nthat an extension of the present model, including both\nnear-Earth and distant X-lines in a manner similar to\nRussell [2000], could reproduce this phenomenon more\nrealistically.\n[31] In the first example, after 1300 UT, the end of the\ndisconnected tail is found at \u00012000 RE. In the second\nexample this appears to extend beyond \u00014000 RE at all\ntimes. Interestingly, after 1100 UT in Figure 3j the tail flux\ncontent reduces to zero near \u00012500 RE but then increases\nagain beyond this, in effect a disconnected disconnected-tail.\n(In fact, F < 0 between these two tail portions, indicating the\npresence of reversed curvature field lines in this region, as\ndiscussed in section 2.2.) This disconnected structure occurs\nwhen a long connected tail is disconnected, such that a short\nconnected tail remains. The disconnected field lines will\ntake a considerable time to straighten (reach F in Figure 1),\nduring which time they can be swept a long distance down-\nstream of the connected tail. This is seen to be occurring\nin Figures 4b\u20134d, where the earthward end of the discon-\nnected tail is approaching the end of the connected tail. In\nthis second example, with VPS = 2 VSW, it is expected that\nthe disconnected tail will extend beyond x = 10000 RE\n(\u00010.5 AU). For lower values of VPS the tail would extend\neven farther. In other words, the downstream solar wind\ncan contain significant magnetic signatures of its interaction\nwith the Earth, a long wake, without this being continuous\nin nature.\n4. Conclusions\n[32] This paper has presented a simple model that allows\nthe profile of flux in the connected magnetotail to be\ndetermined from a knowledge of the present size of the\npolar cap and the history of dayside reconnection. The flux\ncontent of the disconnected tail is found from the history of\nboth polar cap size and dayside reconnection. The basis of\nthe model is that the oldest open field lines have been\nstretched the farthest downtail by the solar wind flow. The\nmodel shows that for a given polar cap size the tail is longer\nif little dayside reconnection has occurred in the recent past.\nThis follows as rapid dayside reconnection implies rapid\nnightside reconnection if the polar cap area is to remain\nunchanged, and rapid nightside reconnection quickly\nremoves the oldest open field lines from the system. The\nmodel further shows that differing rates of lobe reconnec-\ntion at the northern and southern high-latitude magneto-\npause could lead to considerable differences in the typical\nage, and hence lengths, of the two magnetotail lobes.\n[33] The model has not explicitly addressed the issue of\nclosed field line regions sometimes observed in the flanks of\nthe magnetotail at distances of a few hundred RE [e.g., Slavin\net al., 1985]; it has been suggested that these are associated\nwith a curved distant X-line [Slavin et al., 1985] or are near-\nEarth flank field lines which have been carried downtail by\ndiffusive momentum transfer from the magnetosheath [e.g.,\nMist and Owen, 2002]. We offer an alternative interpretation,\nnoting that draped c+ open field lines produced by lobe\nreconnection will coat the flanks of the tail with regions of\nBz-positive magnetic field, which could be misinterpreted as\nclosed field lines if viewed in the equatorial plane.\n[34] It is known that open magnetic field lines allow the\ningress of solar wind plasma across the magnetopause into\nthe magnetosphere, though this is usually assumed to occur\nprimarily in the vicinity of the dayside [e.g., Cowley, 1980].\nHowever, as suggested by Slavin et al. [1985] and Lee and\nAkasofu [1989], plasma entry should occur along the length\nof the magnetotail, wherever open field lines cross the\nmagnetopause. As our model provides an estimate of the\nopen flux crossing the magnetopause as a function of\ndowntail distance, it should allow the time-dependent nature\nof this plasma entry process to be studied in more detail.\n[35] Finally, as mentioned in section 1, long magnetic\ntails are an inherent feature of planetary magnetospheres. It\nis possible that our model could be employed to determine\nthe Dungey cycle contribution to the tails of planets other\nthan Earth.\n[36] Acknowledgments.
