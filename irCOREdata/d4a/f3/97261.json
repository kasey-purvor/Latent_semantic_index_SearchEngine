Introduction\nThe development of multicellular organisms from a single fertilised egg cell is a\ncomplex spatio-temporal process. Central to the process is the ability of each cell\nformed during multiple rounds of cell division to adopt a state that is appropriate\nto its spatial and temporal position within the developmental process. The princi-\npal mechanism that allows cells with identical genetic material to adopt and main-\ntain distinct states is differential gene expression. The degree to which each gene\n\u2217Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: eag@for.mat.bham.ac.uk (E.A.

Successful development depends critically on the tight co-ordination in both\nspace and time of gene expression in cells. This co-ordination is achieved by con-\nstant communication between cells over both short and long ranges. The signals\nexchanged, which can take many forms, have the capacity to influence gene ex-\npression in a way that is dependent on the states of both the sending and receiving\ncells. In this way, gene expression is co-ordinated in space and time so as to finally\ngenerate the stable pattern of differentiated cell types that is characteristic of each\norganism.\nRecent experimental advances have provided detailed information on the\nmolecular mechanisms that are involved in the establishment of patterns of gene\nexpression in a number of model organisms. A key issue that remains difficult to\naddress with current experimental techniques, however, is how local molecular in-\nteractions are coordinated in space and time. It is important to note that successful\ndevelopment depends not only on the generation of appropriate spatial patterns,\nbut also on the timing of each pattern-forming event. Development proceeds at a\nwell-defined (though temperature-dependent) rate for each organism, and this rate\ncan be strikingly rapid. For example, the basic body plan of the zebrafish is estab-\nlished in under 24 h (Kimmel et al., 1995). When considering the overall tempo of\na patterning event, it is essential to understand the timescales involved in the basic\nmolecular processes that contribute to patterning. As stated above, patterning dur-\ning development depends to a large extent on the regulation of gene expression.\nGene expression proceeds through a number of stages. First, a faithful tran-\nscript of the gene sequence is produced in the cell nucleus in the form of a lin-\near polymeric ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecule. This primary transcript is then\nchemically processed in the nucleus. Specific sections of the transcript (introns)\nmay be excised and the remaining sections (exons) spliced to produce a modified\ntranscript known as messenger RNA (mRNA) that is then exported from the nu-\ncleus to the cytoplasm through pores in the nuclear membrane. In the cytoplasm,\neach mRNA can act as a template for protein synthesis. Complex molecular ma-\nchinery translates the sequence of the mRNA molecule into the corresponding\nsequence of amino acids that constitutes a protein molecule. After further pro-\ncessing, the resulting protein molecules can then participate in cellular functions\nsuch as metabolism, regulation of transcription and intercellular signalling.\nGiven the complexity of these mechanisms, it is not surprising that a consid-\nerable delay can exist between a change in the primary events that regulate the\nlevel of expression of a gene (i.e. the rate at which primary transcripts of the\ngene are made) and the corresponding change in the rate of appearance of com-\npleted protein products. Furthermore, it is important to note that the processes\nof gene transcription and mRNA translation involve the production of long poly-\nmeric molecules by the sequential addition of monomers (typically in the range\nof thousands to millions per gene). Transcription and translation are thus genuine\ndelay (rather than slow accumulation) processes: the output of the processes is a\ndelayed function of the input. The magnitudes of transcriptional and translational\ndelays clearly depend on the size of the genomic sequence of the gene in question;\ntypical cumulative delays are of the order of a few tens of minutes, but can be as\ngreat as several hours (Tennyson et al., 1995).\nBulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130 101\nSince the timescale of individual patterning events in development is of the same\norder of magnitude as these delays (particularly in fast-developing embryos such\nas zebrafish), it is important to explore the effects that time delays have on the\nform and tempo of pattern formation. However, the origin of these delays in the\nbasic molecular events that underlie all cellular function make it very difficult\nto manipulate specific delays experimentally. Mathematical modelling provides\na complementary approach to experimental manipulation, and provides an ideal\nsetting in which to explore the effects of time delays in different mechanisms of\npattern formation. In order to focus clearly on the effect of time delays, it is im-\nportant to first consider simple models of pattern formation rather than detailed\nmodels that provide a more accurate description of real cellular events. The ef-\nfects of delays on intracellular feedback circuits has been studied both generally\n(Mahaffy and Pao, 1984; Mahaffy, 1988) and, more recently, in relation to spe-\ncific gene expression data (Monk, 2003). In the context of cellular pattern forma-\ntion, delays have been proposed to play a central role in the generation of the\nspatially co-ordinated oscillations of gene expression underlying the formation of\nvertebrate somites (Lewis, 2003). Veflingstad et al. have used a model of Notch-\nmediated lateral inhibition to show that delays can have profound effects on the\nmode and tempo of cellular pattern formation (Veflingstad et al., 2005). In this\nstudy, we explore the effects of delays in a reaction diffusion model of pattern\nformation.\n1.1. The reaction diffusion mechanism\nThe reaction diffusion mechanism is a particularly elegant means by which spa-\ntially heterogeneous patterns can form. Initially proposed by Turing (1952), this\nmechanism has since been explored in a large number of biological and chemical\ncontexts, and has been experimentally verified for specific reacting chemical sys-\ntems (Ouyang and Swinney, 1991). As a putative mechanism for biological pattern\nformation, it is commonly assumed that reacting and diffusing chemicals, referred\nto as morphogens, provide the source of spatial organisation, whereby concentra-\ntion thresholds cue cell fate decisions, ultimately leading to global spatially hetero-\ngeneous patterns of cell state. This has been considered in numerous possible ap-\nplications; early examples include animal coat markings (Murray, 1981, 1993), hair\npatterns in Acetabularia (Goodwin et al., 1985; Murray, 1993), dorso-ventral or-\nganisation of the embryonic sea urchin (Meinhardt, 1982), and stolon formation in\nmarine hydroids (Meinhardt, 1982). These diverse models have many differences\nwith regard to the assumptions concerning the interaction, production and decay of\nthe morphogens. Nonetheless, it is assumed that the morphogens are transported\nby diffusion (and occasionally convection, as with marine hydroid stolon formation\n(Meinhardt, 1982)), and in particular that pattern is formed by short-range activa-\ntion and long-range inhibition, as is characteristic of the eponymous Turing bifur-\ncation. This bifurcation is typically shared among the many biologically motivated\ngeneralisations of the reaction diffusion mechanism such as the mechano-chemical\nmodels (Murray et al., 1983; Oster et al., 1983) which, in complete generality, can\ninclude effects due to, for example, cell convection, chemotaxis, haptotaxis and\ngalvanotaxis (Murray, 1993).\n102 Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130\nThese early models of pattern formation preceded the large amounts of recent\nmolecular and genetic information currently being elucidated for many develop-\nmental and cellular pattern formation phenomena. As such, they were often con-\nsidered to be simple representations of more complex underlying processes. For\nexample, it was speculated that the short-range activation could be due to the au-\ntocatalysis of a slowly diffusing molecule, the self-induced release of a bound ver-\nsion of a poorly transported protein, or via a co-inhibitory mechanism (Meinhardt,\n1982).\nSince Turing\u2019s original proposal was made, it has become clear that a wide range\nof biological \u2018morphogens\u2019 direct differential cellular responses in development by\ninducing distinct levels of gene expression in responding cells (Tabata and Takei,\n2004) at significant distances from their source (Vincent and Briscoe, 2001). How-\never, while morphogens play significant roles in many pattern forming events dur-\ning development, there is no definitive evidence for a set of Turing morphogens\nthat generate pattern by undergoing a Turing bifurcation in a biological system.\nNonetheless, there has been speculation that a Turing type mechanism may be\ninvolved in vertebrate limb development (Miura and Shiota, 2000; Glimm et al.,\n2004; Miura and Maini, 2004) and avian feather bud formation (Jung et al., 1998).\nIn addition, a number of experiments have indicated that the secreted TGF-\u03b2 pro-\nteins Nodal and Lefty behave as an activator-inhibitor reaction diffusion system in\nzebrafish mesendodermal induction (Chen and Schier, 2001, 2002; Branford and\nYost, 2002, 2004; Solnica-Krezel, 2003; Chen and Shen, 2004).\nLevels of gene expression are often assayed by in situ hybridisation, which allows\nthe local concentration of specific mRNA transcripts to be visualised throughout a\ntissue, and thus provides an indication of the rates of transcription of target genes.\nIt is this technique that has allowed the spatial distribution of putative morphogens\nto be visualised, for example during the formation of avian feather buds and ze-\nbrafish mesendoderm patterning. Thus, one can typically preclude the possibility\nraised in the modelling studies pre-dating such molecular data that short-range ac-\ntivation might be due to, for example, the self-induced release of a bound version\nof a protein.\nSuch observations are also important as they reveal an aspect to Turing\u2019s mech-\nanism that has not been considered in biological pattern formation, at least out-\nside the context of ecological systems. This aspect is the time delay associated with\ngene expression (see above). Since many of the putative morphogens that func-\ntion during development are secreted proteins, they cannot regulate gene expres-\nsion in target cells directly. Rather, they will typically bind to a cell-surface recep-\ntor and consequently modulate the activities of cytoplasmic proteins that transmit\nreceptor-mediated signals to the nucleus (signal transduction). Signal transduc-\ntion, and cytoplasmic processes required for the secretion from cells of further\nmorphogens, can only increase the effective delay separating the receipt of a sig-\nnal by a cell from any resulting changes in morphogen secretion by the cell. In the\ncontext of a reaction diffusion model, these delays will appear in the kinetic terms\nwhich represent the morphogen-regulated rates of morphogen production.\nThere have been a number of studies of reaction diffusion systems in the pres-\nence of time delays (Ruan, 1998; Boushaba and Ruan, 2001; Gourley and Ruan,\n2002) in the context of nutrient recycling for plankton populations, with an overall\nBulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130 103\nemphasis on the Turing instability. These studies show that a Turing instability is\npossible in such systems (Ruan, 1998; Boushaba and Ruan, 2001), but taking into\naccount the diffusive transport of individuals during the time delay results in no\nTuring instability on a bounded domain (Gourley and Ruan, 2002). The Turing\nbifurcation has also been observed to fail for the modified Lengyel\u2013Epstein two-\nvariable model with time delays, used to simulate a delayed illumination feedback\nfor the photosensitive chlorine dioxide\u2013iodine\u2013malonic acid (CDIMA) reaction\n(Li and Ji, 2004).\nOn surveying the possible effects of time delays on reaction diffusion models\nfor pattern formation, one can immediately deduce that time delays do not af-\nfect the existence of steady states of the underlying equations. However, it is un-\nclear whether they destabilise any steady state, to yield oscillatory solutions or\nwhether they prevent a Turing instability from occurring. Equally importantly,\nin the context of development, it is also unclear whether time delays alter the\nrate at which the system may approach its large time asymptote. Changes in\nthe time course of patterning, and in the nature of intermediate transients, can\nbe of critical importance in a biological setting. Furthermore, it is important to\nnote that in many developing systems domain growth occurs on roughly the same\ntimescale as biological pattern formation (for example, Glimm et al., 2004). Thus,\ngrowth often constitutes an integral part of a pattern forming process and is\nknown to exert a significant influence on the dynamics of the system in ques-\ntion (Arcuri and Murray, 1986; Kondo and Asai, 1995; Crampin et al., 1999, 2002;\nGlimm et al., 2004). Thus, the effects of domain growth are also considered in\nthis paper.\nIn the following, we investigate the effects of gene expression time delays in an\nexemplar one dimensional, two component, reaction diffusion pattern formation\nmodel on both stationary domains and domains with spatially uniform exponen-\ntial growth. Our ultimate aim is to determine whether or not the effects of gene\nexpression time delays can substantially alter the behaviour of a putative cellular\nreaction diffusion patterning system.\n2. Reaction diffusion model and linear theory\nIn this section, we introduce the exemplar reaction diffusion model that we will\ninvestigate, which has Schnakenberg kinetics, and we will briefly investigate the\nlinear behaviour of perturbations from the homogeneous steady state. We take\nthis opportunity to inform the reader that a summary table of all variables and pa-\nrameters, excluding those introduced in the appendices, can be found in Appendix\nB.2.\n2.1. Schnakenberg kinetics\nThere is not, as yet, a cellular pattern formation system fully characterised in\nterms of reacting and diffusing molecular components. Thus any cellular pattern\nformation reaction diffusion model ultimately speculates on the details of the\n104 Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130\ninteractions for its various constituents. However, a common feature of all such\nmodels is the short-range activation and the long-range inhibition (Murray, 1993;\nMeinhardt, 1982). Thus, we here consider a model with Schnakenberg kinetics,\nwhich is the simplest reaction diffusion pattern formation system that has such an\ninterpretation (p. 376\u2013379, Murray, 1993).\nFor a suitable non-dimensionalisation, the Schnakenberg reaction diffusion\nequations, in the absence of domain growth and time delays, can be written in\nthe form\n\u2202a\n\u2202t\n= D\n\u03bbL20\n\u22022a\n\u2202x2\n+ p\u2212 ab2, \u2202b\n\u2202t\n= \u0004\n2D\n\u03bbL20\n\u22022b\n\u2202x2\n+ q \u2212 b+ ab2. (1)\nHere b is the concentration of the activator, a is the concentration of the inhibitor,\nD> 0 is the dimensional diffusivity of the inhibitor, \u03bb > 0 is the dimensional de-\ncay rate of the activator and L0 > 0 is the size of the physical domain. The decay\nrate \u03bb is positive definite as we require activator decay to prevent an unphysi-\ncal positive feedback in activator production. We have x \u2208 [0, 1], by the spatial\nrescaling, and p,q, \u0004 are constant, with p,q > 0, \u0004 \u2208 (0, 1) and typically \u0004 \u0004 1,\nwhich we will assume below at all times. Note that \u00042 is the ratio of the activa-\ntor diffusion coefficient and the inhibitor diffusion coefficient.

In the next sections we will focus on\nhow a Turing bifurcation in a system lacking time delays is affected by the inclu-\nsion of time delays and thus restrict parameter values appropriately. Finally, note\nthat one can immediately deduce that the non-autonomy does not significantly in-\nfluence the location of the bifurcation, at least while \u03b4 \u0004 1.\n2.2. Gene expression time delays\nThe autocatalytic production of the activator occurs via the non-linear terms \u00b1ab2\nin the above equations. This can be interpreted as a law of mass action balance for\nthe reaction\nA+ 2B \u2192 3B,\nwhere A, Bdenote the protein molecules whose concentrations are represented by\na,b respectively. As illustrated previously, it is reasonable to assume that activator\nautocatalysis in the reaction diffusion mechanism occurs via gene expression. Such\n106 Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130\na production mechanism would have to be subject to gene expression time delays,\nwhich are very roughly estimated to be in the range of 10 min to a few hours (Lewis,\n2003).\nIn what follows, the timescale is taken to be the reciprocal of the decay rate of\nthe activator. With a suitable scaling of the activator and inhibitor concentrations,\nthe Schnakenberg reaction diffusion equations on a domain with spatially uniform\nexponential growth and a simple, non-distributed, gene expression time delay, can\nbe written in the form\n\u2202a\n\u2202t\n+ \u2202\n\u2202y\n(ua) = D\n\u03bb\n\u22022a\n\u2202y2\n+ p\u2212 a(y, t)b2(y, t),\n\u2202b\n\u2202t\n+ \u2202\n\u2202y\n(ub) = \u0004\n2D\n\u03bb\n\u22022b\n\u2202y2\n+ q \u2212 b\u2212 2a(y, t)b2(y, t)\n+ 3a(y\u03c4 , t \u2212 \u03c4 )b2(y\u03c4 , t \u2212 \u03c4 ). (7)\nAs with Eq. (1), D is the dimensional diffusivity of the inhibitor, \u03bb is the dimen-\nsional decay rate of the activator in the absence of domain growth and \u00042 is the\nratio of diffusion coefficients. In addition, u is the velocity field of the domain\ngrowth and y \u2208 [0, L(t)], where L(t) > 0 is the domain length. In what follows, we\nwill restrict ourselves to considering uniform exponential growth\nL(t) = L0 e\u03b4t\/2, L0 > 0.\nWe also have t > \u03c4 , with \u03c4 denoting the gene expression time delay, and y\u03c4\ndef=\nYy(s = t \u2212 \u03c4 ), where Yy(s) is the solution of the characteristic equation\ndYy\nds\n(s) = u(Y, s), Yy(s = t) = y.\nThus, Eq. (7) represents\nA+ 2B\nbinding at a cell surface receptor at location (y, t), followed by signal transduction,\nregulated gene expression, and the subsequent release of 3B protein molecules af-\nter a gene expression time delay of \u03c4 . However, in this period, the cells are moved\nby the underlying domain growth velocity field u and hence at the location (y, t)\nthe amount of B released is governed by events at location (y\u03c4 , t \u2212 \u03c4 ). Note that in-\ntracellular events are not considered to be subject to diffusion, as the intracellular\nmedium is not free to diffuse into the extracellular medium.\nHence, we must only consider the effects of convection by the underlying do-\nmain growth velocity field in considering the delayed term, rather than consid-\nering both convection and diffusion. One might consider different kinetics with,\nfor example, the three B molecules each being released at different times during\nthe interval [t \u2212 \u03c4, t]. We will briefly address the issue of different kinetics in the\ndiscussion at the end of this paper.\nBulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130 107\nWith uniform exponential growth, L(t) = L0 e\u03b4t\/2, we have (Crampin et al.,\n1999)\nu(y, t) = y L\u02d9(t)\nL(t)\n= \u03b4y\/2.\nSubstituting this in the above equations yields y\u03c4 = y e\u2212\u03c4\u03b4\/2, and rescaling the spa-\ntial coordinate via (x, t) = (y\/L(t), t), yields the following non-dimensionalised\nequations\n\u2202a\n\u2202t\n= 1\n\u03b3 (t)\n\u22022a\n\u22022x\n+ p\u2212 \u03b4\n2\na \u2212 a(x, t)b2(x, t)\n\u2202b\n\u2202t\n= \u0004\n2\n\u03b3 (t)\n\u22022b\n\u2202x2\n+ q \u2212 b\u2212 \u03b4\n2\nb\u2212 2a(x, t)b2(x, t)\n+ 3a(x, t \u2212 \u03c4 )b2(x, t \u2212 \u03c4 ).

In addition, setting \u03c4 = 0 in the above equa-\ntions, one recovers Eq. (2).\n2.2.1.

(9)\nFor no domain growth, one can consider \u03b3 as a bifurcation parameter. One can\nshow, for \u0004 \u0004 1, that there are no oscillations at the critical value of \u03b3 , i.e. \u03b3crit. This\nvalue corresponds to the bifurcation where Eq. (9) first exhibits a non-negative\ngrowth rate for An, on increasing \u03b3 from a sufficiently small value, for any posi-\ntive integer n. See Appendix A.3 for further details, where we additionally show\nthat Eq. (6) also gives \u03b3crit for non-zero time delays in the absence of domain\ngrowth.\nFor time dependent \u03b3 , a linear analysis is not possible with standard techniques\nand hence we proceed numerically. The modulus of the first component of An=1 is\nplotted for Eq. (9) in Fig. 1 with a selection of growth rates and time delays for a\ntypical set of parameter values. These plots are representative. Many parameters\nand initial conditions have been considered and the comments made below apply\ngenerally; further results can also be found in Appendix A.1.\n108 Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130\n0 100 200 300\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\nM\nod\nul\nus\n o\nf 1\nst\n \nco\nm\npo\nne\nnt\n o\nf  \nA\nn\n=\n1\n0 500 1000 1500\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\n0 500 1000 1500\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\n0 500 1000 1500\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\nGrowth Rate, \u03b4 = 0.006\n    Time delay \u03c4 = 28   \nGrowth Rate, \u03b4 = 0.000375    \n         Time delay \u03c4 = 2      \nGrowth Rate, \u03b4 = 0.006    \n    Time delay \u03c4 = 14       \nGrowth Rate, \u03b4 = 0.003    \n    Time delay \u03c4 = 14       \ntime, t time, t time, ttime, t\nFig. 1 Sample solutions for the modulus of the first component of An=1 as governed by Eq.

The solid line in\nthe third plot from the left peaks at an amplitude of \u223c3500. The solid line in the two left-hand\nplots and the dashed lines grow indefinitely as time increases. In the above plots time is non-\ndimensionalised with respect to the inverse of the decay rate of the activator, \u03bb\u22121, while n = 1,\np = 0.9, q = 0.1, \u00042 = 0.001, \u03b3 (t = 0) = 0.05 and the initial conditions are An=1 = (0.95, 1.05) for\nt \u2208 [0, \u03c4 ].\nNote, firstly, the gene expression time delays do not induce oscillations in the\nlinearised equations but they do drastically increase the time it takes for the sys-\ntem to move away from the homogeneous steady state. Furthermore, we see in the\nright-hand plots of Fig. 1 that the modulus of the first component of An=1 increases\nat early time, followed by a peak, prior to an eventual decay back to O(1) values\nor less. In Appendix A.1 we observe that the large time asymptotes of the com-\nponents of An=1 always decay to O(1) values or less for sufficiently large \u03c4\u03b4. One\ncannot rely on naive instability arguments, where the dynamics are only consid-\nered near the homogeneous steady state, under such circumstances. For example,\ndetermining if the components of An=1 initially move away from the homogeneous\nsteady state is insufficient as it is not clear if this instigates an instability given that\nthe large time asymptotes for the components of An=1 could decay to O(1) values\nor smaller. The question of whether pattern actually forms depends on whether\nthe size of the components of An=1, and the value of \u03b7, are sufficient to allow the\nnon-linear dynamics of the full Eqs. (8) to take hold and instigate a pattern. Ulti-\nmately, this depends on the full non-linear dynamics of the system and is not easily\nanswered analytically. Thus, noting these limitations of a linear analysis, we will\nproceed to investigate the full non-linear equations, rather than investigate the\nlinear equations further for \u03c4\u03b4 > 0.\n3. The non-linear, non-autonomous model\nIn the following section we present some representative parameter values and ini-\ntial conditions required for detailed numerical simulations of the time delayed\nBulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130 109\nTable 1 A reference set of parameter estimates for Eq.

Further, tables of representative parameter values used for the\nsimulations below, which have differing growth rates (\u03b4) and activator diffusivities\n(\u00042D), are listed in Tables B.1 and B.2 in Appendix B.2.\nGiven that no putative cellular reaction system has been completely determined\nin terms of its molecular constituents, there are no definitive parameter estimates\nfor the diffusivities, parameters governing the kinetics or the length of time over\nwhich the pattern formation mechanism is active. (There may nonetheless be\nbounds on these quantities.) We are therefore forced to consider plausible param-\neter estimates while recognising that the numerical simulations can only sample a\nsubregion of parameter space. As we will indicate, the qualitative behaviour we\nfind in this paper is typical, at least for regions of parameter space that we have\nsampled.\n3.2. Initial conditions\nAs with standard Turing models of biological pattern formation, we consider ini-\ntial conditions that are perturbations of the homogeneous steady state. Our initial\nconditions below are based on the functions aIC=1(x), bIC=1(x) which are plotted\nin Fig. 2; algebraic expressions for these plots can be found in Appendix B.1. We\nwill also consider initial conditions constructed from the following\naIC=2(x) = aIC=1(1 \u2212 x), bIC=2(x) = bIC=1(1 \u2212 x). (10)\nThere are a number of points to note about these functions. Firstly, they are a\nperturbation of the homogeneous steady-state solution of Eq. (8) (providing \u03b4 \u0004\n1, as is the case here). Secondly, they are consistent with the zero flux boundary\nconditions. Thirdly, reference to Appendix B.1 will reveal that the perturbations\nhave been constructed from polynomials, so that they would excite a large number\nof Fourier modes once such modes become unstable as \u03b3 increases.\nTypical choices of initial conditions we will use below are of the form\na(x, t) = aIC=1(x), b(x, t) = bIC=1(x) t \u2208 [0, \u03c4 ], (11)\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n0.9998\n1\n1.0002\n1.0004\n1.0006\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n0.8994\n0.8996\n0.8998\n0.9\n0.9002\nx x \na \n   b \nFig. 2 The functions aIC=1(x) and bIC=1(x) are given by the solid lines in the above plot, while\nthe functions aIC=2(x) and bIC=2(x) are given by the dashed lines.

Another choice of initial conditions we\nwill commonly use is\na(x, t) = aIC=1(x)(1 + 0.0025 cos(\u03c0x) cos(\u03c0 t\/(2\u03c4 ))) t \u2208 [0, \u03c4 ],\nb(x, t) = bIC=1(x)(1 + 0.0025 cos(\u03c0x) cos(\u03c0 t\/(2\u03c4 ))) t \u2208 [0, \u03c4 ], (13)\nand similarly for IC = 2. One should note that we have investigated the model\nfor numerous other initial conditions in addition to those stipulated above, though\nperturbing the homogeneous steady state to a similar degree (not shown). The\nresults presented below are representative of the behaviour observed in all our\nsimulations.\n4. Simulation results\nIn this section, we present results of numerical simulations of the time delayed re-\naction diffusion system given by Eq. (8) for both stationary domains and domains\nexhibiting uniform exponential growth. A standard, implicit, numerical method is\nused, though with time delays incorporated.\n4.1. Gene expression time delays, with no domain growth\nFor the initial conditions given by Eqs. (11) and (12) and no domain growth, the\nmain effect of the gene expression time delay is a large increase in the time re-\nquired for the system to reach its long time asymptote. This is clearly illustrated\nin Fig. 3 where a gene expression time delay of \u03c40, which corresponds to 12 min,\ninduces an additional patterning lag of roughly 60\u03c40. Similar observations have\nbeen consistently observed for other parameter values and other initial conditions\ndiscussed in Section (3.2).\nOne should also note that the time delays do not induce oscillations in this sys-\ntem, as observed generally. Furthermore, the location of the activator maximum\nin the large time asymptote in general can depend on the details of the initial con-\nditions. By \u2018maximum\u2019 note that we always mean the maximum on varying the\nspatial coordinate, for fixed time, rather than global maximum across all space and\ntime. Analogous results for all of the above are also observed when \u00042 = 0.016.\n4.2. Gene expression time delays and spatially uniform exponential domain growth\nIn Figs. 4\u20136, we have a domain doubling time of 2 days while in Fig. 7 the domain\ndoubling time is 8 days and it is 12 h in Fig. 8. In all these plots \u03b3 (t = 0) < \u03b3crit and\nthe initial conditions consist of perturbations about the homogeneous steady state,\nas detailed in the figure captions.\n112 Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130\nFig. 3 In this figure, there are 12 greyscale plots for the activator, b, with the parameter values\nspecified in Table 2. The horizontal axis represents the interval x \u2208 [0, 1], while the vertical axis\nrepresents t\/\u03c40, where \u03c40 is the smallest gene expression time delay considered and is equivalent to\na dimensional value of 12 min. The value of b(x, t\/\u03c40) is proportional to the greyscale at (x, t\/\u03c40)\nand can be determined using the greyscale bar to the right of each plot. The gene expression time\ndelay for each plot is given by \u03c4 = Tdel\u03c40 where Tdel is listed above each plot. The label IC = 1\ncorresponds to the initial conditions given by Eq. (11), while the label IC = 2 corresponds to the\ninitial conditions specified in equation (12) on the time interval [0, \u03c4 ]. As mentioned in Section 1,\nit is typically assumed in pattern formation models that concentration thresholds in reacting and\ndiffusing morphogens cue cell fate decisions. This is consistent with the prediction of a differential\nresponse in the above plots according to whether or not a cell is within a region of relatively high\nactivator concentration. Similarly for the remaining figures in this paper.\n4.2.1. Loss of robustness\nBy robustness, we mean a lack of sensitivity to small changes in the initial con-\nditions. We can observe in Figs. 4\u20138 that in the absence of time delays, the\nactivator pattern is independent of the initial conditions, at least once the central\npeak has formed. For \u03c4\u03b4 sufficiently large, a sensitivity to the initial conditions can\nbe observed for \u00042 = 0.001, as in Fig. 4 where the location of the activator peaks\nin general depends on the details of the initial conditions. For \u00042 = 0.016 a loss of\nrobustness can still occur (not shown) though it requires a fine tuning of the gene\nexpression time delay to observe this.\n4.2.2. The onset of patterning\nOne can readily make the important observation that the introduction of gene ex-\npression time delays leads to a substantial delay in the onset of patterning. This can\nbe seen in more detail in Fig. 9 for a selection of parameter values. For example,\nin the third row of this figure, we have a magnification of runs which are governed\nby the parameters of Fig. 8. The initial conditions are those of Fig. 8 multiplied\nby a factor (1 + 0.0025 cos(\u03c0x) cos(t\/2\u03c4 )). Note that Tdel = 0.5 corresponds to a\ntime delay of 6 min and for this time delay, the pattern initiates when \u03b3 \/\u03b30 \u223c 25\nwhile for no time delay the pattern initiates for \u03b3 \/\u03b30 \u223c 5. Recall that \u03b3 scales\nBulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130 113\nFig. 4 With \u03b3 (t = 0) def= \u03b30, note that \u03b3 \/\u03b30 is a monotonic function of time, t , and thus one can\nconsider the activator concentration, b, as a function of (x, \u03b3 \/\u03b30) rather than (x, t). In this fig-\nure, there are 12 greyscale plots of the activator, b(x, \u03b3 \/\u03b30), for the parameter values specified in\nTable 1. Thus, the value of b(x, \u03b3 \/\u03b30) is proportional to the greyscale at (x, \u03b3 \/\u03b30) and can be deter-\nmined using the greyscale bar to the right of each plot. The horizontal axis represents the interval\nx \u2208 [0, 1], while the vertical axis is \u03b3 \/\u03b3 (t = 0), which is in the range [1, 48000], corresponding to an\nincrease in the domain length by a factor of approximately 220. We have Tdel \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16},\nwhich correspond to the values of \u03c4 specified in Table 1, i.e. \u03c4 = Tdel\u03c40, where \u03c40 is the smallest\ngene expression time delay considered and is equivalent to a dimensional value of 12 min. We\nadditionally have that IC = 1 corresponds to the initial conditions given by Eq. (11), while IC = 2\ncorresponds to the initial conditions specified by Eq. (12) on the time interval [0, \u03c4 ]. Analogous\ncomments apply for the remaining figures.\nwith the square of the domain length. Thus, the effect of a 6 min time delay is to\nchange the domain length at pattern initiation by a factor of\n\u221a\n25\/5 = 2.2. Thus, the\ndelay in the onset of patterning is roughly a domain doubling time, i.e. about 12 h.\nAnalogous results are observed for other parameter values and initial conditions\nconsidered in both Fig. 9 and generally.\n4.2.3. Highly irregular patterning and the failure of the Turing instability\nThe Turing bifurcation can be observed to fail. By this we specifically mean that\nan instability observed in the non-delayed system is absent due to the effects of\na sufficiently large time delay. The Turing instability does not materialise in such\ncases even though the linear theory predicts that there is growth away from the\nhomogeneous steady state, as illustrated in the right-hand plots of Fig. 1 for repre-\nsentative parameter values. Note that the reasons for why linear theory predictions\nof growth away from the homogeneous steady state do not necessarily predict an\ninstability were discussed in Section 2.2.1.\nThe Turing instability fails in Fig. 4 for a gene expression time delay of \u03c4 = 16\u03c40\nand in an analogous manner, in Figs. 6 and 8. A highly irregular patterning is\n114 Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130\nFig. 5 Let \u03b30\ndef= \u03b3 (t = 0). In the above there are 12 grayscale plots of b(x, \u03b3 \/\u03b30) for the pa-\nrameter values specified in Table 1. As previously, the horizontal axis represents the interval x \u2208\n[0, 1], while the vertical axis is \u03b3 \/\u03b3 (t = 0). We have Tdel \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16}, which correspond to\nthe gene expression time delays specified in Table 1, namely \u03c4 = Tdel\u03c40, where \u03c40 is the smallest\ngene expression time delay considered and is equivalent to a dimensional value of 12 min. We\nalso have that IC = 1 and IC = 2 correspond to the initial conditions specified in Fig. 4, except\nthat they are multiplied by the factor (1 + 0.0025 cos(\u03c0x) cos(t\/(2\u03c4 ))), as specified in Eq. (13).\nFurther details concerning the interpretation of these plots is provided in the caption for Fig. 4.\nFig. 6 Let \u03b30\ndef= \u03b3 (t = 0).

Further\ndetails concerning the interpretation of these plots is provided in the caption for Fig. 4.\nBulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130 115\nFig. 7 As previously \u03b3 (t = 0) def= \u03b30. In this figure there are 12 greyscale plots of the activator\nprofile b(x, \u03b3 \/\u03b30). The parameter values differ from Fig. 6 only in that the domain growth rate has\nbeen reduced by a factor of 4; the parameter values are listed in Table B.1 of Appendix B.2. The\ninitial conditions are those used for Fig. 6 and are given by Eqs. (11) and (12) for IC = 1, IC = 2,\nrespectively. Further details concerning the interpretation of these plots is provided in the caption\nfor Fig. 4.\nFig. 8 Above there are 10 greyscale plots of the activator profile b(x, \u03b3 \/\u03b30), where \u03b3 (t = 0) def=\n\u03b30. The parameter values differ from Fig. 6 only in that the domain growth rate has been increased\nby a factor of 4 and a different selection of time delays in considered. These delays for each plot\nare given by Tdel \u00d7 \u03c40, where Tdel is specified above each plot and \u03c40 corresponds to a dimensional\ngene expression time delay of 12 min for the non-dimensionalisation presented in Table 1. The\nparameter values are explicitly listed in Table B.2 of Appendix B.2. The initial conditions are\nthose used for Fig. 6 and are given by Eqs. (11) and (12) for IC = 1, IC = 2 respectively. Further\ndetails concerning the interpretation of these plots is provided in the caption for Fig. 4.\n116 Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130\nFig. 9 In the first row, we have magnified the plots in Fig. 4 for IC = 1 and Tdel \u2208\n{0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16}. In particular, we have taken the vertical axis of each plot to be in a range\nof \u03b3 \/\u03b3 (t = 0) which allows us to see when pattern formation first initiates. For example, in the\nleft-hand plot of the first row, we have pattern first forming when \u03b3 \/\u03b3 (t = 0) \u223c 4. In the plots\non the first row, the gene expression time delay is \u03c4 = Tdel \u03c40, where \u03c40 is the smallest time de-\nlay typically considered and corresponds to 12 min given the non-dimensionalisation presented\nin Table 1. Similar comments apply for the second and third rows. In the second row, the plots\ncorrespond to the early stages of the plots presented in Fig. 6 for IC = 1. In the third row, we\nhave magnified the early stages of plots which have the same parameter values and IC = 1 initial\nconditions used in Fig. 8, except the initial conditions have been perturbed by the multiplicative\nfactor (1 + 0.0025 cos(\u03c0x) cos(t\/(2\u03c4 ))). See the text of Section 4.2.2 for further details.\nobserved in Fig. 5 for the largest time delay considered there. In Fig. 10, similar\nirregular behaviour can be observed when \u00042 = 0.016 for the same initial condi-\ntions. One can observe that the precise onset of the failure of the Turing instability\ndepends on the details of the initial conditions, by comparing Figs. 4 and 5. How-\never, once highly irregular patterning is observed, small increases in the time delay\nsubsequently result in a failure of the Turing instability. An illustration of this is\ngiven in Fig. 10 and is observed generally.\n4.2.4. Oscillations\nIn general, oscillations of significant amplitude have not been commonly observed\non the spatially growing domains for this model. The linear bifurcation analysis of\nAppendix A.3 also indicates that any growth away from the homogeneous steady\nstate is, initially, non-oscillatory. Note though that oscillations can be present,\nas in Fig. 10, when the time delay is sufficiently large to induce the highly ir-\nregular behaviour discussed above, though some fine tuning of the time delay is\nrequired.\nBulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130 117\nFig. 10 In this figure there are 20 plots of the activator, b. The parameter values and initial\nconditions are the same as those used in Fig. 5 with the exception of the values for the gene\nexpression time delay, \u00042 = 0.016, \u03b3 (t = 0) = 0.08 and the run duration. The latter is such that\nthe domain length increases by a factor of 70. We have Tdel \u2208 {4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 9, 10, 11},\nwhich gives the gene expression time delay \u03c4 = Tdel \u03c40. Here, we can see how the dynamics initially\nexhibits irregular behaviour as the gene expression time delay is raised, with the ensuing failure\nof the Turing instability as the time delay is increased further.\n5. Discussion\nIn the following we are interested in assessing whether gene expression time delays\ncan be neglected for the putative cellular pattern formation mechanism consid-\nered in this paper. We will consider both stationary domains and domains with\nuniform exponential growth. For the discussion below it will be useful to note\nthat\n\u03c4\u03b4 = 2(ln 2) \u00d7 Gene expression time delay\nDomain doubling time\n.\nThis follows immediately on noting that \u03b4\/2 is the exponential growth rate of\nthe domain length L(t) and hence the domain doubling time, td, is given by\ntd = (2 ln 2)\/\u03b4; dividing by the time delay, \u03c4 , gives the above after rearranging.\n5.1. No domain growth\nWe firstly consider stationary domains and note that although time delays often in-\nduce oscillations in dynamical systems (see, for example, Veflingstad et al. (2005)),\nnone are observed here. Thus, time delays need not invalidate reaction diffusion\n118 Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130\nmodels of pattern formation on stationary domains by inducing oscillatory (rather\nthan stationary) patterns of activator and inhibitor concentrations.\nWe do, however, observe sensitivity of the final stationary pattern to the initial\nconditions, as illustrated by Fig. 3. Such sensitivity is a common and old criticism\nof reaction diffusion models (Bard and Lauder, 1974; Bunow et al., 1980) and is\nnot specific to the presence of gene expression time delays. It can usually be elim-\ninated in models that lack time delays by incorporating domain growth (Crampin\net al., 1999) or by including the effects of an underlying asymmetry (Meinhardt,\n1982; Page et al., 2005). In the absence of domain growth, which is considered be-\nlow, we anticipate that the incorporation of an underlying asymmetry can enforce\nrobustness in delay models as it does in non-delay models.\nThe most striking and important result of incorporating a gene expression time\ndelay into our reaction diffusion model is that the times to the onset of patterning\nand to approach the large time asymptotic behaviour increase dramatically as the\ndelay is increased. Thus, even for quite modest delays of 10 or 20 min, the time\ntaken for the system to achieve pattern is increased by several hours. Such delays\nin the onset and\/or stabilisation of pattern impose potentially severe constraints\non the domain of applicability of reaction diffusion models that rely on regulated\ngene expression. In particular, in the context of embryonic development, where\nthe timescale of pattern establishment is typically only a few hours and cells have\nlimited time windows in which they are competent to respond to patterning cues\n(Kimmel et al., 1995), our results illustrate clearly the importance of considering\ngene expression time delays in proposed models of pattern formation. Since tim-\ning is of importance in all biological systems, it is also clear that any time delays\nexisting in putative patterning mechanisms should not be neglected in general, as\nwill be discussed in detail in the following sections.\n5.2. Spatially uniform exponential domain growth\nWe proceed to consider spatially uniform exponential growth. It is interesting to\nobserve the close similarity between the plots in Fig. 6 with Tdel = 2, 4 and the\nplots in Fig. 7 with Tdel = 8, 16. Similarly, for the plots in Fig. 8 with Tdel = 0.5,\n1. The respective plots share the same value of \u03c4\u03b4 and initial conditions. This\nstrongly indicates that the effect of the gene expression time delays and domain\ngrowth with regard to the failure of the Turing instability, the onset of irregular\npatterning or the eventual pattern formed, is governed by the parameter grouping\n\u03c4\u03b4. Further evidence of this is presented in Appendix A.2 and has been observed\ngenerally.\n5.2.1. Loss of robustness\nFor sufficiently rapid domain doubling times, the presence of gene expression time\ndelays can entail that the incorporation of domain growth is not sufficient to elim-\ninate a sensitivity to the initial conditions, as seen in Fig. 4. This is in contrast\nto general conclusions arising in Crampin et al. (1999) when no time delays are\npresent. However, we do not envisage this to be a severe problem for the reac-\ntion diffusion mechanism in virtually all of its applications, as we anticipate, but do\nnot explicitly show here, that the effects of an underlying asymmetry can enforce\nBulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130 119\nrobustness (as in Meinhardt (1982)). In addition, the loss of robustness is no longer\nmanifest, apart from with parameter fine tuning, when \u00042 = 0.016. This addition-\nally indicates that for larger values of \u00042, the loss of robustness is no longer an\nimportant issue.\n5.2.2. The onset of patterning\nAs with no domain growth, we have the very important observation that small gene\nexpression time delays induce a much larger time delay in the patterning onset\nand the time taken for the system to approach its large time asymptotic behaviour.\nThus, in the presence of uniform exponential domain growth, we can also conclude\nthat the patterning lag can be highly sensitive to the inclusion of time delays.\n5.2.3. Highly irregular patterning and the failure of the Turing instability\nAll our simulations are consistent with the observation that once \u03c4\u03b4 is sufficiently\nlarge, the Turing instability fails, though the details of how large the time delay\nmust be to prevent the Turing instability from occurring can depend on the initial\nconditions.\nTo place the above observation in context, we note that detailed simulations\nshow that highly irregular behaviour or a Turing instability failure will occur once\n\u03c4\u03b4 > 1\/30 for \u00042 = 0.016. Consider a gene expression time delay at the minimum\nestimate of 10 min (Lewis, 2003), which is probably the most appropriate esti-\nmate for a fast developmental process. For this time delay, and \u00042 = 0.016, the\ndomain doubling time has to be greater than 5 h, to ensure the Turing insta-\nbility and regular patterning. We note that some developmental processes with\nZebrafish for example occur with domain growth on significantly faster timescales\n(Kimmel et al., 1995).\nFrom such observations, the failure of the Turing instability is typically outside\nthe range of possible parameter values for the current model. However, irregular\npatterning or a Turing instability failure can occur if the domain is growing at a rate\ncommensurate with the very fastest developmental processes. Thus, we have the\nobservation that when modelling such processes, one should again explicitly justify\nthe neglect of gene expression time delays if a Turing bifurcation is a possibility as,\nfor the putative model here, it can make a substantial difference.\n5.2.4. Oscillations\nFrom our observations, oscillations can occur in parallel with highly irregular pat-\nterning with a careful choice of the time delay. However, the set of parameter val-\nues for which oscillations occur is observed to be a subset of the parameter space\nwhere regular patterning fails due to the occurrence of highly irregular behaviour\nor the failure of the Turing instability. Thus it is more important to investigate and\ndelimit where the latter occur, as performed above.\n5.2.5. Sensitivity to the details of the kinetics and other modelling assumptions\nWe note briefly that the non-dimensionalisation timescale, taken to be\n\u03bb\u22121 = 3.1 min, can be changed without changing the key observations of this\npaper. For example, the failure of the Turing instability is governed by \u03c4\u03b4 which\nis independent of alternative timescales. Similarly, the size of the ratio of the gene\n120 Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130\nexpression time delay to the additional lag in the patterning onset is independent\nof a temporal rescaling. Thus the key observations presented here are in fact\nvalid for a family of dimensionalised parameter values, generated by altering\nthe non-dimensionalisation timescale. We have also observed that the overall\nbehaviour of the system with regard to the final pattern, the onset of irregular\npatterning and the failure of the Turing instability, is most strongly determined by\nthe parameter grouping \u03c4\u03b4. Taking into account the results of Appendix A.2 this\nobservation has held for an order of magnitude variation in each of \u00042, \u03c4 and \u03b4.\nSimilarly, the additional lag in the patterning onset has always been observed to\nbe much greater than the gene expression time delay.\nNonetheless, we have still only sampled a fraction of parameter space. However,\nthe fact we have not conducted an exhaustive search of parameter space should not\nbe seen as a fundamental weakness of the paper. Here, our aim is to illustrate the\neffects of gene expression time delays, and to show that in general they cannot\nsimply be dismissed for a representative selection of parameter values and initial\nconditions for a representative model.\nFurthermore, most models incorporate pattern formation kinetics that are car-\nicatures of more realistic kinetics, assuming these are even known. It is typi-\ncally considered that such systems are effectively equivalent (e.g. p. 438, Murray\n(1993)). However, if this proves to be no longer true on incorporating gene ex-\npression time delays, then one has also to carefully justify the details of the choice\nof kinetics. This would typically require more information than is available for a\ngiven cellular pattern formation system. Under such circumstances, the presence\nof gene expression time delays would present a considerable obstacle for the deter-\nmination of whether reaction diffusion pattern formation mechanisms are present\nin cellular contexts. This clearly merits further investigation.\n6. Summary, conclusions and future work\nWe have motivated why, biologically, one needs to consider including gene ex-\npression time delays in the formulation of putative reaction diffusion models of\ncellular pattern formation processes. In turn, we have derived an exemplar model\nexhibiting this phenomenon utilising Schnakenberg kinetics on a fixed domain and\non a domain which is uniformly growing at an exponential rate.\nOur most important observation is that small gene expression time delays induce\na large increase in the time required for the onset of pattern formation on both a\nfixed domain and for spatially uniform exponential domain growth.\nOur study also demonstrates that, in the presence of such domain growth and\ngene expression time delays, a naive linear analysis that relies on determining\nwhether there is an initial growth of perturbations about a steady state, is con-\nceptually unreliable in predicting when a Turing instability occurs. In addition, on\nthe growing domains considered, the behaviours observed in numerical simula-\ntions are governed by the ratio of the gene expression time delay to the domain\ndoubling time. We observe the onset of highly irregular behaviour and\/or a failure\nof the Turing instability once this ratio is sufficiently high. However, failure occurs\nonly for the very fastest domain doubling times, at least for the exemplar model\nBulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130 121\nconsidered here. Finally, we have seen that in the presence of gene expression time\ndelays, pattern sensitivity to the initial conditions can occur, especially for very low\nratios of activator to inhibitor diffusivities. However, we anticipate that this pat-\ntern sensitivity could be overcome by incorporating spatial asymmetry, as has been\ndemonstrated for non-delayed systems.\nThe above observations do not rule out reaction diffusion as a putative pattern\nformation mechanism, whether on a stationary or uniformly growing spatial do-\nmain. However, when considering patterning events for which rapid establishment\nof pattern is critical, such as in the tissues of developing embryos, our results show\nthat any putative time delays cannot be neglected in general without careful justi-\nfication. In particular, our finding that time delays dramatically increase the time\ntaken for the reaction diffusion system to initiate patterns imposes potentially se-\nvere constraints on the potential molecular details of any Turing system that might\noperate during developmental patterning.\nIn this paper, we have studied the effect of a single delay in a specific kinetic\nscheme. It would be interesting to extend this work to the case of multiple gene\nexpression time delays, for non-exponential, non-uniform and reactant-controlled\ngrowth, and in higher spatial dimensions. Similarly, it would be interesting to con-\nsider the effects of gene expression time delays on alternative pattern formation\nmodels, such as those based on mechano-chemical mechanisms. In particular, we\nnote that in the specific kinetics that we have studied, the time delay appears only\nin a positive feedback term of the activator equation. Previous work on diverse\ndelay systems has shown that delays are most likely to induce oscillatory dynam-\nics when they occur in negative feedback loops. Given that we have not found\nevidence for prominent oscillatory dynamics in our model, it would be of particu-\nlar interest to explore alternative patterning mechanisms that incorporate delayed\nnegative feedback terms. Finally, we note that we have only explored the effects\nof a discrete delay in this paper. Distributed delays provide a more realistic rep-\nresentation of gene expression mechanisms, and an exploration of the effects of\ndistributed delays in a range of kinetic schemes would certainly be worthwhile.\nSuch work is in progress.\nA Appendices: supplementary information\nA.1 Further results for the non-autonomous, time delayed, linear equations\nOur starting point is Eq. (9) which governs the behaviour of An in Section 2.2.1,\nwhere we remarked that once \u03c4\u03b4 is sufficiently large, the components of An=1 will\npeak before decaying to O(1) values or less for sufficiently large time. This can be\nobserved in the two right-hand plots of Fig. 1. Here we illustrate, numerically, that\nthis behaviour is commonplace. We solve the retarded Eq. (9) with n = 1, p = 0.9,\nq = 0.1, \u00042 = 0.001, \u03b3 (t = 0) = 0.05, for a wide range of values for the exponential\ngrowth rate, \u03b4, and the gene expression time delay, \u03c4 , with initial conditionsAn=1 =\n(1.05, 0.95) for t \u2208 [0, \u03c4 ]. Time is non-dimensionalised with respect to the inverse\nof the decay rate of the activator, denoted \u03bb\u22121, consistent with the scalings used in\nSection 2.2.1.\n122 Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130\nFig. 11 The plots show min{50, |[An=1(\u221e)]1|} and min{50, |[An=1(\u221e)]2|}. Note that\n|[An=1(\u221e)]i | denotes the modulus of the large time asymptote for the i th component of\nAn=1. See Appendix A.1 for further details and parameter values.\nLet |[An=1(\u221e)]i |, i \u2208 {1, 2}, denote the large time asymptote of the modulus of\nthe i th component of An=1. We wish to observe when |[An=1(\u221e)]i | takes O(1)\nvalues or less and how this depends on the domain growth rate, \u03b4, and the time\ndelay \u03c4 . Given |[An=1(\u221e)]i | will be unbounded for certain choices of \u03b4 and \u03c4 we\nplot min(50, |[An=1(\u221e)]1|), min(50, |[An=1(\u221e)]2|). Hence, for example, if a plot\nhas a value of 50, the large time asymptote is clearly not O(1) or less and we thus\nhave sufficient information for our needs. In all our plots min(50, |[An=1(\u221e)]1|)\nand min(50, |[An=1(\u221e)]2|) are estimated numerically from the values of An=1\nat t = 104\u03bb\u22121 which, for the parameters of this paper, is a very long\ntimescale.\nWe first plot min(50, |[An=1(\u221e)]1|) and min(50, |[An=1(\u221e)]2|) against \u03b4 in the\nupper row of Fig. 11. Each mark in these plots will typically correspond to more\nthan one data point; for example, the marks for a given \u03b4 will generally correspond\nto numerous values of \u03c4 . From the third row of Fig. 11, we can clearly see that\nonce \u03c4\u03b4 gets sufficiently large (> 0.057 approx.), the large time values of compo-\nnents of An=1 are always O(1) or less. We have considered numerous other initial\nconditions which yield identical plots, while results with other parameter values,\nincluding changing \u00042 to 0.016, are analogous.\nA.2 Further results: non-linear simulations\nIn Figs. 12 and 13 there are further additional results for \u00042 = 0.001 with the same\ninitial conditions as presented in Fig. 5. The plots are different from those in Fig. 5\nonly in that the domain growth rate is increased by a factor of four in Fig. 12 and\ndecreased by a factor of four in Fig. 13. It is interesting to observe the similarity\nBulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130 123\nFig. 12 As previously \u03b3 (t = 0) def= \u03b30.

The parameter values correspond to an increase in the exponential growth rate by\na factor of 4 compared to the parameters in Table 1 and Fig. 5. All other parameters, the axes and\nthe initial conditions are as specified in Fig. 5. The time delays for each plot are given by Tdel \u00d7 \u03c40,\nwhere Tdel is specified above each plot and \u03c40 corresponds to a dimensional gene expression time\ndelay of 12 min for the non-dimensionalisation presented in Table 1. Further details concerning\nthe interpretation of these plots is provided in the caption for Fig. 4.\nbetween the plots in Fig. 12 with Tdel = 1, 2, 4 and the plots in Fig. 5 with Tdel =\n4, 8, 16. Also observe that plots in Fig. 5 with Tdel = 1, 2, 4 are similar to plots with\nTdel = 4, 8, 16 in Fig. 13. This adds further evidence to the observation that the\neffect of the gene expression time delays with regard to the final pattern, and the\nonset of irregular patterning and the failure of the Turing instability, is governed\nby the parameter grouping \u03c4\u03b4.\nA.3 A linear analysis of the time delayed equations\nIn this appendix we will perform a linear analysis of the time delayed equations\nclose to the steady state. We assume \u00042 \u0004 1 and we will:\n\u2022 prove that in the absence of domain growth, there are no oscillations for the\nlinearised time delayed equations at the Turing bifurcation. This corresponds\nto the point where, treating \u03b3 as a bifurcation parameter, an instability is first\ninduced by increasing \u03b3 from a sufficiently small value.\n\u2022 derive Eq. (6) for (i) \u03c4 = 0, \u03b4 \u2265 0 and (ii) \u03b4 = 0, \u03c4 \u2265 0.\nTo proceed, let p11, p12, . . . ,q21,q22 denote the components of P and Q in\nEq. (9). We have q11 = q12 = 0 and we will additionally assume the remaining of\nthese parameters are of unit magnitude with p22 + q22 > 0, q22 > 0, as is the case\nfor the kinetics used throughout this paper.\n124 Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130\nFig. 13 There are 12 greyscale plots of the activator profile b(x, \u03b3 \/\u03b30), where \u03b3 (t = 0) def= \u03b30.\nThe parameter values correspond to a decrease in the exponential growth rate by a factor of 4\ncompared to the parameters in Table 1 and Fig. 5. All other parameters, the axes and the initial\nconditions are as specified in Fig. 5. The time delays for each plot are given by Tdel \u00d7 \u03c40, where\nTdel is specified above each plot and \u03c40 corresponds to a dimensional gene expression time delay\nof 12 min for the non-dimensionalisation presented in Table 1. Further details concerning the\ninterpretation of these plots is provided in the caption for Fig. 4.\nA.3.1 No oscillations for the linearised time delayed equations\nat the Turing bifurcation\nSubstitute An(t) = exp[\u03bbnt]Bn into Eq. (9) for \u03b3 constant, \u03b4 = 0 and \u03c4 > 0. As with\na standard linear instability analysis in the absence of delays, the \u03bbn are complex\ngrowth rates governing the behaviour of the linearised perturbations about the\nhomogeneous steady state. The critical value of \u03b3 , denoted \u03b3crit, will correspond to\nwhere Re(\u03bbn) first becomes zero on increasing \u03b3 , for any positive integer value of\nn. With Re(\u03bbn) = 0, Im(\u03bbn) = \u03b2 one can show that Re(\u03bbn) first becomes zero on\nincreasing \u03b3 for the smallest \u03b3n(\u03b2, \u03c4 ), n \u2208 Z+, \u03b2 \u2208 R satisfying both\n\u03b3n(\u03b2, \u03c4 ) = 2n\n2\u03c02\u00042\nA(\u03b2\u03c4 ) +\n\u221a\nA2(\u03b2\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u00042B(\u03b2, \u03c4 ) (A.1)\n[\u03b2(1 + \u00042) + q22 sin(\u03b2\u03c4 )] n\n2\u03c02\n\u03b3n(\u03b2, \u03c4 )\n= C(\u03b2, \u03c4 ) (A.2)\nwhere\nA(\u03b2\u03c4 ) def= q22 cos(\u03b2\u03c4 ) + p22 + \u00042 p11\nB(\u03b2, \u03c4 ) def= 4 [(p11 p22 \u2212 p12 p21) + (p11q22 \u2212 p12q21) cos(\u03b2\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03b2q22 sin(\u03b2\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03b22]\nC(\u03b2, \u03c4 ) def= p11[\u03b2 + q22 sin(\u03b2\u03c4 )] + \u03b2(p22 + q22 cos(\u03b2\u03c4 )) \u2212 p12q21 sin(\u03b2\u03c4 ). (A.3)\nBulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130 125\nClearly, the smallest value of \u03b3 corresponds to n = 1, and we take n = 1 be-\nlow. Further note that \u03b2 = 0 is consistent with Eq. (A.2) and, from Eq. (A.1),\nyields\n\u03b31(0, \u03c4 ) = 2\u03c0\n2\u00042\nA(0) +\n\u221a\nA2(0) \u2212 \u00042B(0, \u03c4 )\n= \u03c0\n2\u00042\nA(0)\n(1 + O(\u00042)) = \u03c0\n2\u00042\np22 + q22 (1 + O(\u0004\n2)),\nusing the fact that A(0), B(0, \u03c4 ) are of unit magnitude.\nWe now seek other values of \u03b2 which give consistent solutions of Eqs. (A.1) and\n(A.2) and which yield a smaller value of \u03b31. For |\u03b2| > 0, we have by combining\nEqs. (A.1) and (A.2) that\n[\u03b2(1 + \u00042) + q22 sin(\u03b2\u03c4 )]\n[\nA(\u03b2\u03c4 ) +\n\u221a\nA2(\u03b2\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u00042B(\u03b2, \u03c4 )] 1\n2\u00042\n= C(\u03b2, \u03c4 ).\n(A.4)\nFirstly, suppose that 1 \n \u03b2 > 0. Expanding the above, in terms of \u03b2 yields\n\u03b2\n\u00042\n(1 + q22\u03c4 + o(1))(p22 + q22 + o(1))\n= \u03b2[p11 + q22 p11\u03c4 + p22 + q22 \u2212 p12q22\u03c4 + o(1)].\nNoting that q22 > 0, p22 + q22 > 0 and of unit magnitude, it is impossible to balance\nthe left and right hand sides for sufficiently small \u00042; thus we can note that there is\nno solution for 1 \n |\u03b2| > 0. Note that Eq. (A.4) can only be satisfied if C(\u03b2, \u03c4 ) \n 1\nor one of the bracketed terms on the left of this expression is much smaller than\nunity (or some combination of these possibilities). Further suppose that\n|A(\u03b2\u03c4 ) +\n\u221a\nA2(\u03b2\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u00042B(\u03b2, \u03c4 )| \u0004 1.\nThis, combined with Eq. (A.1), entails that the resulting value of \u03b3 must be much\nlarger than \u03b31(0, \u03c4 ). This therefore cannot yield the bifurcation point.\nSuppose instead that C(\u03b2, \u03c4 ) \u223c O(1\/\u00042). For a fixed gene expression time delay\n\u03c4 , and \u0004 \u0004 1 sufficiently small, we ultimately require \u03b2 \u223c O(1\/\u00042). However, for\n|\u03b2| \n 1, we have, from equation (A.2) that\n|\u03b31(\u03b2, \u03c4 )| =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c02(1 + O(|\u03b2|\u22121) + O(\u00042))p22 + p11 + q22 cos(\u03b2\u03c4 )\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \n \u03b31(0, \u03c4 ) \u223c O(\u00042).\nThus, again, the resulting value of \u03b3 cannot correspond to the critical value of \u03b3\nfor sufficiently small \u0004.\nFinally, suppose that\n[\n\u03b2(1 + \u00042) + q22 sin(\u03b2\u03c4 )\n] \u223c O(\u00042). For \u03c4 \u223c O(\u0004) or less we\nhave \u03b2 \u223c O(\u00042) \u0004 1, which contradicts the above, and our task is complete. For\ngeneral \u03c4 > 0, note that the above reasoning means that we do need not to consider\n1 \n \u03b2 > 0, so without loss of generality, we can just consider \u03b2 \u223c O(\u0004) or greater.\n126 Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130\nTherefore\nsin(\u03b2\u03c4 )\n\u03b2\u03c4\n= \u22121 + \u0004\n2\nq22\u03c4\n+ O\n(\n\u00042\n\u03b2q22\u03c4\n)\n= \u2212 1\nq22\u03c4\n(1 + O(\u0004)) (A.5)\nand thus, \u03c0 < |\u03b2\u03c4 | < q22\u03c4 (1 + O(\u0004)) with\ncos(\u03b2\u03c4 ) = \u00b1[1 \u2212 (\u03b2\/q22)2 (1 + O(\u0004))]1\/2 < 1, (A.6)\nfor an appropriate choice of sign. The final inequality arises as \u03b2 is bound away\nfrom zero. For any value of \u03b2 which solves Eq. (A.5), we have that \u03b2, and hence\nB(\u03b2, \u03c4 ), is bounded as \u0004 \u2192 0, and hence\n\u03b31(\u03b2, \u03c4 )= 2\u03c0\n2\u00042\nA(\u03b2\u03c4 ) +\n\u221a\nA2(\u03b2\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u00042B(\u03b2, \u03c4 ) =\n\u03c02\u00042\nA(\u03b2\u03c4 )\n(1 + O(\u00042))\n= \u03c0\n2\u00042\np22 \u00b1 q22\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 (\u03b2\/q22)2 (1 + O(\u0004))\n(1 + O(\u00042))\n>\n\u03c02\u00042\np22 + q22 (1 + O(\u0004\n2)) = \u03b31(0, \u03c4 ).\nThe above inequality arises from (A.6), on noting that q22 > 0 and entails that the\nabove value of \u03b31(\u03b2, \u03c4 ) cannot correspond to the bifurcation. All the above gen-\neralises if Eq. (A.4) is achieved via a combination of any of the above mentioned\npossibilities; for example C(\u03b2, \u03c4 ) \u223c O(1\/\u0004) and [\u03b2(1 + \u00042) + q22 sin(\u03b2\u03c4 )] \u223c O(\u0004).\nThus, we must have that \u03b2 = 0 at the bifurcation point, and hence there is no os-\ncillation.\nA. 3.2 Derivation of Eq. (6)\nOnce more, let p11, p12, . . . ,q21,q22 denote the components of P and Q in Eq. (9).\nFor no time delay, i.e. \u03c4 = 0, with \u03b4 \u2265 0, substitute Eq. (5) into Eq. (4). This again\nyields Eqs. (A.1) to (A.3), though now for \u03c4 = 0, \u03b4 \u2265 0. The results derived in the\nprevious section generalise immediately, and thus we have \u03b2 = 0 and n = 1 at the\nbifurcation point in the absence of a time delay. Hence, substituting \u03c4 = 0, \u03b2 =\n0,n = 1 into Eq. (A.1), with \u03b4 \u2265 0, yields Eq. (6).\nInstead suppose \u03c4 \u2265 0, \u03b4 = 0. From the previous section we have \u03b2 = 0 at the\nbifurcation point. Furthermore we have \u03b3crit is given by Eq. (A.1) and, by inspec-\ntion of Eq. (A.3), we have that A(0) and B(\u03b2 = 0, \u03c4 ) are independent of \u03c4 . Thus,\nEq. (6), which is valid for \u03b4 = \u03c4 = 0, from above, is also valid for \u03b4 = 0, \u03c4 > 0.\nA. 4 Comparison of linear theory large time asymptotes and non-linear theory\nFor \u00042 = 0.001, it is interesting to note that the large time asymptotes of the lin-\near system given by Eq. (9) are O(1) or not according to whether \u03c4\u03b4 is greater or\nless than 0.057; see Appendix A.1. However, detailed non-linear numerical simu-\nlations (not shown) demonstrate that the Turing instability will always occur once\nBulletin of Mathematical Biology (2006) 68: 99\u2013130 127\n\u03c4\u03b4 < 0.084 when \u00042 = 0.001. Thus, in the region \u03c4\u03b4 \u2208 [0.057, 0.084] there is distinct\ndisagreement between the behaviour of the linear theory\u2019s large time asymptotes\nand the non-linear simulations. This is presumably because although within this\nregion the linear theory predicts initial perturbations should eventually decay at\nlarge time, the intermediate growth is sufficient to trigger non-linearities in the\nequations and effect a Turing instability. We may conclude that even the large\ntime asymptotes of the linear theory are not particularly accurate predictors for\nthe behaviour of the full non-linear equations, though they indicate the correct\norder of magnitude for the critical value of \u03c4\u03b4 concerning the onset of a Turing\ninstability.\nB Additional details\nB.1 Algebraic expressions for the initial conditions\nThe algebraic expressions for aIC=1(x), bIC=1(x), as plotted in Fig. 2, are\naIC=1(x) = 0.9 + Eax5(1 \u2212 x2)[Aax3 + Bax2 + Cax + Da],\nbIC=1(x) = 1.0 \u2212 Ebx7(1 \u2212 x2)[Abx3 + Bbx2 + Cbx + Db], (B.1)\nwith x \u2208 [0, 1], where Ea = 0.00125, Eb = 0.00600 and\nAa = \u2212170.6666682, Ba = 412.4444479, Ca = \u2212312.8888910, Da = 71.1111113,\nAb = \u2212130.8444445, Bb = 337.0666669, Cb = \u2212281.6000002, Db = 75.3777778.\nThe substantial accuracy for the quoted values of Aa, Ba, . . . , Db are so that the\nperturbations remain small in the interval x \u2208 [0, 1] and, especially, that they sat-\nisfy the zero flux boundary conditions.
