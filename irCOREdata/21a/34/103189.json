INTRODUCTION\nBritain\u2019s  anti-discrimination  legislation  outlaws   the   victimising   of   persons   who   use   that\nlegislation. The legislation, by way of a number of statutes, covers discrimination regarding  Race,\nSex,    Disability    and    (for    Northern    Ireland)    Political    Opinion    or    Religious    Belief.\nVictimisation provides a separate course of action for anyone  treated  less  favourably  \u2018by  reason\nthat\u2019 they brought a discrimination claim, or did something else by reference to the legislation.\n            In Chief Constable of  West  Yorkshire  Police  v  Khan  the  House  of  Lords  rejected  the\n\u2018causative\u2019 - or but for - approach to the phrase \u2018by reason that\u2019, which the House established in  R\nv Birmingham City Council, ex parte EOC [1989] 1 AC 1156, and James v Eastleigh BC [1990]  2\nAC 751 (for direct discrimination) and Nagarajan v LRT [1999] 4 All ER 65, [2001] AC 502  (for\nvictimisation).  The  House  also  restated  the  view  that  the  comparator   for   establishing   less\nfavourable treatment should be a person who has not done the act in any sense at all  and  clarified\nwhat was meant by \u2018less favourable\u2019.\n2. THE LEGISLATION\nVictimisation is defined in section 2, Race Relations Act 1976 as:\n\u2018(1) a person (\u201cthe discriminator\u201d) discriminates against another person (\u201cthe  person  victimised\u201d)\nin any circumstances relevant for the purposes of this any  provision  of  this  Act  if  he  treats  the\nperson victimised  less  favourably  than  in  those  circumstances  he  treats  or  would  treat  other\npersons, and does so by reason that the person victimised has--\n(a) brought proceedings under the Act against any person; or\n(b)        given information or evidence in connection with such proceedings; or\n(c)        otherwise done anything under or by reference to the Act in relation to any person; or\n(d) alleged that any person has committed an act which (whether or  not  the  allegation  so  states)\nwould amount to a contravention of the Act, or by reason  that  the  discriminator  knows  that  the\nperson victimised intends to do any of those  things,  or  suspects  that  the  person  victimised  has\ndone, or intends to do, any of them.\nSection 4(1), Sex Discrimination Act 1975, section 55(2), Disability Discrimination Act 1995  and\narticle  5(3),  Fair  Employment  and  Treatment  Order  1998  each  provides  a  definition  that  is\nmaterially the same. The acts described in paragraphs (a) to (d) are generally known as  \u2018protected\nacts.\u2019\n3. FACTS AND DECISION\nIn September 1996 Sergeant Khan applied to become an Inspector within his force.  However,  his\nChief Constable failed to support the application. That failure led Khan to issue proceedings under\nthe Race Relations Act. Then in October, Khan applied to be an Inspector with the Norfolk Police.\nActing  on  legal  advice,  the  Chief  Constable  refused  to  provide  the  Norfolk  Police   with   a\nreference. Instead, he stated:\n\"Sergeant Khan has an outstanding industrial tribunal application against the  chief  constable  for\nfailing to support his application for promotion. In the light of that, the chief constable is unable to\ncomment any further for fear of prejudicing his own case before the tribunal.\"\nFollowing that, Khan brought separate proceedings  claiming  that  he  had  been  victimised.  The\nChief Constable argued that the reason for withholding a reference  was  to  avoid  prejudicing  his\nown case in the discrimination proceedings brought by Khan. The House  of  Lords,  reversing  all\nthe decisions below, allowed the Chief Constable\u2019s appeal. In doing so they addressed three issues\nregarding the definition of  victimisation.  Lords  Nicholls,  Mackay  of  Clashfern,  Hoffman  and\nScott each made separate speeches. Lord Hutton agreed with  Lords  Nicholls  and  Hoffman.  The\nHouse considered three elements of the definition of victimisation: (i) with whom is  the  claimant\ncompared to establish less favourable treatment; (ii) what amounts to is less  favourable;  and  (iii)\nthe meaning of \u2018by reason that\u2019.\nA. Treated Less Favourably Than Whom?\nThe Chief Constable argued the treatment given to Sergeant Khan  should  be  compared  with  the\ntreatment that would have been given to an employee who had brought other proceedings, such  as\nlibel, or constructive dismissal. This argument  was  first  raised  in  Kirby  v  Manpower  Services\nCommission [1980] ICR 420, where an employee at a job centre was moved to less desirable work\nbecause  he  disclosed  confidential  information  regarding   suspected   discrimination   by   some\nemployers.  The  EAT  compared  Kirby\u2019s  treatment  to  that  of  a   worker   who   had   disclosed\nconfidential information, but unrelated to discrimination. As this hypothetical worker would  have\nbeen similarly moved to less desirable work, the EAT concluded that Kirby had  not  been  treated\nless favourably. However, the Court of Appeal, in Aziz v Trinity Street Taxis [1988] 2 All ER  860\nrejected  this  approach  and  held  that  the  comparison  should  not  include  any  element  of  the\nprotected act. Otherwise, as Slade, LJ reasoned (at 869), if a defendant could show that  he  would\nhave treated a \u2018Kirby comparator\u2019 in the same way as the claimant, the  \u2018absurd  result\u2019  would  be\nthat the claimant would \u2018necessarily fail\u2019.\n            The House of Lords  followed  Aziz.  Lords  Nicholls,  Scott  and  Hoffman  discussed  this\nissue. For Lord Nicholls it boiled down to a choice between Kirby and Aziz. He concluded (at para\n27): \u2018There are arguments in favour of both approaches. On the whole I  see  no  sufficient  reason\nfor departing from the...approach adopted by Slade,  LJ  in  the  Aziz  case.  Lord  Scott  was  more\ntrenchant. He rejected the Kirby approach, stating (at para 72) \u2018That  cannot  be  right....  It  would\nenable employers to victimise employees  who  brought  race  discrimination  proceedings  against\nthem provided they, the employers, were prepared similarly to victimise  any  employee  who  had\nthe temerity to sue them for anything.\u2019 Lord Hoffman rejected Kirby with equal certainty  (at  para\n48).\n            The point is that the approach in Kirby ensures that virtually no claim could succeed.  This\nis because a \u2018Kirby comparator\u2019 has done the protected act except for the RRA element. Thus  any\nemployer could testify \u2018I treat all complainants the same, whether or not the  complaint  is  one  of\ndiscrimination.\u2019  Further, if one removes only the RRA element from the protected act,  a  tribunal\nis then  effectively  trying  to  identify  less  favourable  treatment  on  grounds  of  race,  which  is\ncovered by section 1, not section 2, thus rendering section 2 meaningless.\n            It is surprising that this argument - that was apparently settled in Aziz back in 1988 - is still\nbeing raised by employers. They may have been encouraged by the Court of  Appeal\u2019s  reluctance\nto overrule its own decision on this element in Cornelius v University College of  Swansea  [1987]\nIRLR 141 where it held (at para 33) that an employer\u2019s refusal to grant a transfer request or  allow\nthe grievance procedure, after the claimant had issued (sex) discrimination  proceedings,  was  not\nless favourable treatment. (See further [2000] 29 ILJ 304.) Since then, in a number cases,  counsel\nfor the defendant has cited Cornelius in support of using a \u2018Kirby comparator,\u2019 only for the  Court\nof Appeal to reject Kirby but \u2018distinguish\u2019 Cornelius. This occurred in Aziz (at 872), Khan  [2000]\nICR 1169, (at para 28) and Brown v TNT Express Worldwide [2001] ICR 182 (at para 33).\nEmployers may have also been encouraged by some sentiments expressed by the judiciary.\nFor  instance,  Lord  Nicholls\u2019  comment  (above)  that  \u2018There  are  arguments  in  favour  of  both\napproaches\u2019 is not the language to  reject  a  case  absolutely.  In  the  same  case  in  the  Court  of\nAppeal, Lord Woolf, MR stated (at para 24): \u2018I would like to look favourably on [the]  submission\nthat you should ask whether the respondent  was  treated  any  differently  from  anyone  else  who\nbrought proceedings\u2019. But he \u2018felt driven\u2019 by precedent and his interpretation of section 2 to reject\nthe \u2018Kirby comparator\u2019. In Khan, only Lords Scott and Hoffman  echoed the certainty of Slade, LJ\nin Aziz. All the same, it must be assumed that  now  the  House  of  Lords  has  rejected  Kirby,  no\nmatter how reluctantly, it is bad law.\nB. Was The Refusal of a Reference \u2018Less Favourable\u2019?\nDespite not receiving a  reference  the  Norfolk  Police  invited  Sergeant  Khan  for  an  interview,\nwhich he failed. It was common ground that had a reference been given, containing the  Yorkshire\nPolice\u2019s low assessment of Sergeant Khan\u2019s managerial  skills,  he  may  not  had  even  made  the\ninterview  stage.  In  other  words,  the  Chief  Constable  argued,  Khan  was   treated   more,   not\nless favourably. The House  of  Lords  rejected  that  argument.  Only  Lords  Hoffman  and  Scott\ndiscussed the matter. Lord Scott concluded (at para 76):\n\u2018It cannot... be enough for s 2(1) purposes simply to show that the  complainant  has  been  treated\ndifferently.....I think it suffices if the complainant can reasonably say that he would have preferred\nnot to have been treated differently.\u2019\nThis approach has echoes  of  the  discrimination  case  (under  s  1  SDA)  R  v  Birmingham  City\nCouncil, ex parte EOC [1989] 1 AC 1156 where a local authority operated a  policy  of  favouring\nboys in the  admission  to  grammar  schools.  They  argued  that  as  there  was  no  evidence  that\ngrammar schools were better than the other schools, girls  had  not  been  less  favourably  treated.\nThe House of Lords held that as the girls were denied a choice which  they  -  and  their  parents  -\nvalued, on reasonable grounds, they had  been  treated  less  favourably.  It  would  seem  that  the\ncourts  should  not  be   too   pedantic   about   this   element.   There   must   be   more   than   just\ndifferent treatment, but it is enough if the complainant perceives - reasonably  -  that  he  has  been\ntreated less favourably.\nC. \u2018By Reason That\u2019\nThis is the controversial aspect of the case. The House of Lords reversed  all  the  decisions  below\non this issue. A unanimous Court of Appeal thought they  had  applied  the  law  as  stated  by  the\nHouse of Lords in the recent case Nagarajan v LRT  [1999]  4  All  ER  65,  (discussed  [2000]  29\nILJ 304). In Nagarajan a four-to-one majority  held  that  the  phrase  \u2018by  reason  that\u2019  should  be\ngiven  a  straightforward  causative  interpretation,  free  from  any  conscious  motivation  on   the\ndefendant\u2019s part. They relied on the interpretation given to section 1, SDA or RRA, which  defines\ndirect discrimination, in R v Birmingham City  Council,  ex  parte  EOC  [1989]  1  AC  1156  and\nJames v Eastleigh Council [1990] 2 AC 751.  Section  1,  SDA,  defines  direct  discrimination  as\nbeing treated less favourably on the grounds of sex. The House of Lords held  in  those  cases  that\nthe \u2019causative\u2019 question raised by the phrase \u2019on the grounds of\u2019 should be  resolved  by  a  simple\n\u2018but for\u2019 test: would the complainant have received  the  same  treatment  from  the  defendant  but\nfor his or her sex? In Nagarajan the majority held that the phrase \u2019by reason that\u2019  was  parallel  to\nthe phrase \u2019on grounds of her sex\u2019 (or \u2019on racial grounds\u2019) used  in  section  1.  In  particular  Lord\nSteyn held (at 79) that this approach was also correct for section  2  because  victimisation  was  as\nserious a mischief as direct discrimination and \u2018common sense\u2019 suggested  that  a  tribunal  should\nask the \u2018equally straightforward\u2019 question: \u2018Did the defendant treat the  employee  less  favourably\nbecause of his knowledge  of  a  protected  act?\u2019  Thus  where  an  interview  panel  underrated  an\napplicant (Mr  Nagarajan)  who  had  previously  brought  discrimination  proceedings,  it  did  not\nmatter that they did so because they were either consciously, or subconsciously, motivated  by  his\nprevious action. Of course Sergeant Khan argued that this simple causative test had to be  resolved\nin his favour because but for bringing the discrimination claim (the protected act), he  would  have\nbeen given a reference. However, the House of Lords  rejected his argument.\nOn the issue of causation Lord Nicholls (at para 29) stated that the phrase  by  reason  that,\n\u2018contrary to views sometimes stated\u2019 does not raise a question of causation, which was a  \u2018slippery\nword\u2019 that could relate to the \u2018effective\u2019 cause, or the \u2018operative\u2019 cause, or the \u2018but  for\u2019  approach.\nHe declared that:\n\u2018...a causation exercise of this type is not required by either section 1(1)(a)  [which  defines  direct\ndiscrimination] or  section  2.  The  phrases  on  racial  grounds  [from  s  1(1)(a)]  and  by  reason\nthat denote a different exercise: why did the alleged discriminator act as he did? What consciously\nor unconsciously, was his reason? Unlike causation, this is a subjective test\u2019.\nLord Scott held (at para 77): \u2018The proceedings [ie Khan\u2019s racial discrimination proceedings]  were\nthe causa sine qua non. But the language used in section 2 is not the language  of  strict  causation.\nThe words by reason that suggest...that it is the real reason, the core reason, the causa causans, the\nmotive, for the treatment complained of that must be identified.\u2019\nIn apparent contrast to Lord Nicholls, Lord Hoffman (at para 54) said that the issue  was  a\nquestion of causation, but that the causal questions raised by sections 1 and 2 \u2018were  not  identical\u2019\n(at para 56). He explained this distinction by stating (at para 59):\n \u2018...the [less favourable] treatment need not be, consciously or  unconsciously,  a  response   to  the\ncommencement of proceedings [ie Khan\u2019s racial discrimination proceedings].... It  is  true  that  an\nemployee who had not commenced proceedings would not have  been  treated  in  the  same  way.\nUnder  section  1,  one  would  have  needed  to  go  no  further.  Under  section  2,  however,   the\ncommencement of proceedings must be a reason for the treatment ...\u2019\nThere is obviously confusion over the precise meaning of the phrase by reason that. Lord Nicholls\nsays it is not causative, Lord Hoffman said that it was. Lord Hutton\u2019s position  is  unclear  because\nhe concurred with both Lord Nicholls and Lord Hoffman. Meanwhile Lord Scott  said  the  phrase\nwas one of not strict causation.\n The reasoning becomes more obscure  when  read  alongside  the  majority\u2019s  speeches  in\nNagarajan. Lord Nicholls - the only judge common to both cases - said in Khan (at  para  29)  that\nhe explained in Nagarajan why the causative approach was not  required.  In  fact,  in  Nagarajan,\nLord Nicholls approved the \u2018objective and not subjective\u2019 approach applied to section 1 in EOC  v\nBirmingham City Council, and  again  in  James  v  Eastleigh  BC,  where  Lord  Goff  specifically\napplied the \u2018but for\u2019 test. Lord Nicholls concluded in Nagarajan (at 71)  \u2018I  can  see  no  reason  to\napply a different approach  to  section  2\u2019.  In  support  of  his  decision,  Lord  Hoffman  cited  the\nfollowing passage from Lord Steyn\u2019s speech in Nagarajan (at 78):\n\u2018[s 2]...contemplates that the  discriminator  had  knowledge  of  the  protected  act  and  that  such\nknowledge caused or influenced the discriminator to treat the victimised person less favourably...\u2019\nUnfortunately, in this part of his speech, Lord Steyn was  merely  repeating  counsel\u2019s  submission\n(on the point that motivation could either conscious or subconscious). Lord Steyn went on to  state\n(at 80) - in contrast to Lord Hoffman -  that  the  \u2018parallel  provisions  [in  sections  1  and  2]...are\nreadily capable of parallel meanings\u2019 and so the causative approach - the \u2018but for\u2019 test - for section\n1, was suitable for section 2.\n            The appeal in Nagarajan turned on whether it was enough that the  employer\u2019s  motivation\n(in  reacting  to  previous  proceedings)  was  subconscious.  The  House  of  Lords,  applying   the\n\u2018straightforward\u2019   causative   test,   held   that   it   was.   Nothing   said    in    Khan    upsets    the\nratio  decidendi  of  Nagarajan,  which   was   that   motivation   could   be   either   conscious   or\nsubconscious.  The  speeches  in  Khan  at  best  side-stepped,  and  at  worst  ignored,   the   wider\nstatements in Nagarajan concerning causation. Nevertheless, a unanimous House of Lords clearly\nrejected the \u2018straightforward\u2019 causative approach. And so, following Khan, that is what the  law  is\nnot. The \u2019but-for\u2019 test is not suitable for cases of victimisation. But it is less easy to  say  what  the\nlaw is.\nThe key to understanding that, so far as it is  possible,  lies  in  the  decision  of  the  whole\nHouse depending upon a fine distinction, between the bringing and existence  of  proceedings.  To\nthis end Lords Nicholls, Hoffman and Scott drew support from Cornelius v University  College  of\nSwansea [1987] IRLR 141. Here, Ms Cornelius brought proceedings against  her  employer  under\nthe SDA and,  pending  the  outcome,  she  was  refused  a  transfer  and  access  to  the  grievance\nprocedure. Consequently she brought  a  separate  action  of  victimisation.  The  Court  of  Appeal\nreasoned (at 145-146) that:\n\u2018The existence of the proceedings plainly did influence [the employer\u2019s] decisions. No doubt,  like\nmost  experienced  administrators,  they  recognised  the  risk  of  acting  in  a  way  which   might\nembarrass  the  handling  or  be  inconsistent  with  the  outcome  of   current   proceedings.   They\naccordingly wished to defer action until the proceedings were over. But that had ...  nothing  to  do\nwith the appellant\u2019s conduct in bringing proceedings under the Act.\u2019\nLords Nicholls, Hoffman and Scott noted that the feature  of  this  passage  was  that  College  had\nacted on the existence of the proceedings, not the bringing of them. Lord Mackay did  not  rely  on\nCornelius, but relied on the same distinction when holding (at 45):\n\u2018It is clear that if the proceedings had been terminated when the request for a reference  was  made\nthe obstacle to giving it would have been removed and I have no doubt that  the  chief  officer  has\nclearly established that...he did not refuse a reference  by  reason  that  Sergeant  Khan  had  raised\nproceedings against him under the Act.\u2019\nBy focussing on what would happen when the proceedings had  finished,  Lord  Mackay  revealed\nthat he too distinguished between the existence of the proceedings and the event of Sergeant Khan\nbringing them.\nThe fine distinction between the bringing and existing of proceedings shows  a  drift  away\nfrom the \u2018straightforward\u2019 approach adopted by the House  of  Lords  in  Nagarajan,  where  Lord\nNicholls himself said (at 71): \u2018... in the application of this legislation legalistic phrases, as  well  as\nsubtle distinctions, are better avoided so far as possible.\u2019 Khan may have defeated  this  distinction\nby adding a second protected act to his claim: under section 2(1)(c), RRA, he had \u2018otherwise done\nanything under or by  reference  to  this  Act.\u2019  As  well  as  having  brought  proceedings,  he  was\n\u2018otherwise\u2019 maintaining them in existence.\nThus far it could be ventured that the  ratio  decidendi  of  Khan  is  that  a  defendant  who\nacted by reason of the existence, and not the bringing, of the proceedings can not  be  liable  under\nsection 2(1)(a), RRA (by reason that the person has \u2018brought proceedings...\u2019). Standing alone, this\nproposition sabotages the  purpose  of  the  House\u2019s  own  rejection  of  the  Kirby  comparator  for\nproving less  favourable  treatment.  Employers  could  simply  argue  that  they  responded  to  all\nproceedings in this way, whatever their nature. So long as the employer  acted  when  proceedings\nwere pending, virtually no claim of victimisation could succeed under section 2(1)(a).\nHowever, Lord Nicholls added  a  further  dimension  when  concluding  (at  para  31)  that\n\u2018Employers, acting reasonably  and  honestly,  ought  to  be  able  to  take  steps  to  preserve  their\nposition in pending proceedings without laying  themselves  open  to  a  charge  of  victimisation.\u2019\nSimilar sentiments were expressed in the other speeches. Lord Mackay noted (at para 44)  that  the\nChief Constable \u2018acted in accordance with perfectly understandable  advice.\u2019  Lord  Scott  said  (at\npara 80) that this approach still allowed for the case where the employer \u2018singled out\u2019 a worker for\nless favourable treatment but allowed \u2018justice to be done to an employer who...would otherwise be\nplaced...in an unacceptable Morton\u2019s fork\u2019. And  Lord  Hoffman  observed  (at  para  59)  that  the\nChief Constable\u2019s act may have been \u2018a reasonable response to the need to protect the  employer\u2019s\ninterests as a party to litigation.\u2019\nIt is now possible to qualify  the  ratio  as  being  that  there  is  no  liability  under  section\n2(1)(a), RRA, where the defendant acted, reasonably and honestly, by reason of the existence, and\nnot the bringing, of proceedings. The qualification appears to safeguard  the  decision  from  abuse\nby employers who  may  otherwise  use  it,  for  example,  to  \u2018single  out\u2019  workers.  However  the\nqualification carries a series of problems.\nFirst and most obviously, there is no such requirement in the  legislation  that  for  liability,\nthe defendant does not act reasonably and honestly. Second, focussing on the  predicament  of  the\n\u2018reasonable and honest\u2019 employer undermines the policy of the provisions, which  is  the  removal\nof deterrents to enforcing the anti-discrimination legislation. The Law Lords\u2019 speeches are littered\nwith statements sympathetic to the employers\u2019 dilemma. Nowhere did a  judge  express  sympathy\nfor the worker who  - as well as having acted just as \u2018reasonably and honestly\u2019 as their employer  -\nwill have his or her career frozen for the duration (conceivably several years) of  the  proceedings,\nsimply because they used anti-discrimination legislation. This  decision  places  the  worker  in  an\nunacceptable \u2018Khan\u2019s fork\u2019, suffering either discrimination or a frozen career.\nWhilst both the employer and the worker will find themselves  in  a  difficult  position,  the\nprovisions on victimisation are  not  aimed  at  resolving  the  employer\u2019s  predicament.  Empirical\nresearch shows that victimisation is a serious problem in the workplace. (See  for  instance  (1990)\n30 EOR 23 where a study  of  103  unsuccessful  claimants  revealed  that  over  a  half  suffered  a\ndetriment of some sort following the action.) Accordingly Lord Steyn  pronounced  in  Nagarajan\n(at  79)  that  victimisation  was  as   serious   a   mischief   as   discrimination   itself.   It   is   now\ninconceivable, one hopes, that a tribunal would embark  on  such  a  diversion  from  the  statutory\nwording and purpose in a case of discrimination under section 1, no matter  how  \u2018reasonably  and\nhonestly\u2019 the defendant had acted.\nThird, this \u2019extra element\u2019 of acting reasonably and honestly  actually  does  little  to   save\nthe decision from sabotaging the purpose of rejecting Kirby. It  will  be  recalled  (see  above)  that\nLord Scott rejected Kirby because (at para 72) \u2018It would enable employers to victimise  employees\nwho brought race discrimination proceedings ...provided ....the employers were prepared similarly\nto victimise any employee who had the temerity to sue them for anything.\u2019 In most  cases  though,\nemployers will prove that they  acted  \u2018reasonably  and  honestly\u2019  by  showing  that  the  company\nnormally treats in the same way, any worker who brings  any  proceedings.  Indeed,  that  was  the\ndefence in Khan.  And  so  the  qualification  does  little  to  prevent  this  decision  subverting  the\nrejection of Kirby. Accordingly, employers can escape liability (once  again)  when,  for  example,\nsuspending  a  worker  on  full  pay,  or  refusing  a  transfer,  promotion,  access  to   a   grievance\nprocedure, or the usual - but discretionary - incremental pay rise or bonus. So long as  all  workers\nare equally \u2018victimised\u2019 pending the outcome of proceedings, a claim of victimisation will fail and\nLord Scott\u2019s words on the Kirby comparator count for little.\nThe fourth problem with the sentiments expressed is that  they  carry  an  indication  that  a\ntribunal should look for an intent to victimise - or simple vengeance - on the part of the  employer.\nUnder the provisions, an employer who acted reasonably and honestly, on \u2018understandable advice\u2019\nand did not \u2018single out\u2019 a worker for treatment, can be liable for victimisation. For instance, where\nseveral months into discrimination proceedings the employer announces, \u2018I\u2019ve had enough of  this\ntrial, it\u2019s gone on far too long. All the  claimant\u2019s  transfer  requests  are  to  be  refused.\u2019  Such  an\nemployer  would  rely  on  Khan  stating  that  he  reacted  to  the  existence,  not  the  bringing,  of\nproceedings.  If  a  tribunal  then  demands  honest  and  reasonable  behaviour  it  must   find   the\nemployer liable. Yet the only difference  between  this  example  and  Khan  is  vengeance,  which\nshould not be an ingredient for liability.\nLord Nicholls\u2019 speech appeared to go further than that by including a racial  motive.  After\napproving Cornelius, he identified a \u2018second  strand\u2019  to  the  case,  noting  that  (at  para  30)  \u2019the\nCollege\u2019s behaviour had nothing to do  with  the  bringing  of  proceedings  under  the  1975  [Sex\nDiscrimination]  Act.  The  decisions  would  have  been  the  same,  whatever  the  nature   of   the\nproceedings, if the subject matter had been allied to the content of the employee\u2019s requests.\u2019 (Lord\nNicholls\u2019 emphasis.) In other words,  to  be  liable,  the  employer\u2019s  reason  for  acting  has  to  be\nrelated to  the  discrimination  legislation  aspect  of  the  protected  act.  This  approach  is  wrong\nbecause it is actually identifying race, or sex, discrimination, and not victimisation. If,  to  prove  a\ncase of victimisation  a  claimant  has  to  prove  racial  discrimination,  then  section  2  would  be\nredundant.  This  is  confirmed  by   section   3(1),   (an   interpretation   section)   which   confines\nracial discrimination to section 1. (The litigant in person in Cornelius argued a similar  line,  cited\nat 144.) The danger of this judgement is  that  it  may  cause  tribunals  only  to  find  victimisation\nwhere there is an intention to victimise, or worse, an intention to discriminate  on  racial,  or  other\nproscribed, grounds.\n            None of this is to say that intention, or motivation, per se should not be a factor.  After  all,\nthe employer is part of the causal chain, or link between the protected act and  the  less  favourable\ntreatment. What goes through the employer must, presumably, go through his mind.  But  the  real\nissue is, motivated by what? In Aziz  (where  the  claimant  was  expelled  for  making  secret  tape\nrecordings as evidence for claim of racial discrimination)  it  was  held  that  the  defendants  were\nmotivated by the breach of trust, even though the tape recordings were part of the protected act. In\nCornelius and Khan the employer was motivated by the existence of the proceedings. These  cases\ndid not turn on an employer\u2019s clean conscience or benign motive, but the dividing (in Aziz), or  the\ndistinguishing (in Cornelius and Khan), of the protected act.\nThus, an element of  motivation  per  se  need  not  curtail  the  simple  causative  approach\nexpressed in Nagarajan and James. So long as the cause of  the  less  favourable  treatment  is  the\nprotected act, taken without division or fine distinctions, motivation is a harmless ingredient.  This\ndoes not impose a \u2018strict liability\u2019 upon defendants, where all that  would  be  required  is  the  less\nfavourable  treatment  and  the  protected  act.  There  remains  a  link  between  the  two.  So,   for\nexample, an employer, who knows that a worker has brought a  complaint  of  sexual  harassment,\nsacks that worker for an entirely separate incident of theft, would not liable for victimisation.\nWith  respect,  in  making  a  fine  distinction  between   the   existence   and   bringing   of\nproceedings and focussing on the \u2018honest and reasonable\u2019 employer\u2019s predicament,  the  House  of\nLords in Khan have strayed from the wording and  the  purpose  of  the  legislation.  This  being  a\nHouse of Lords decision means that now the only remedy for claimants in Khan\u2019s position  lies  in\nParliament, or more realistically, European Community law.\nD. European Community Law \nThe Equal Treatment Directive (76\/207), which covers  sex  discrimination,  does  not,  except  for\none specified  instance  (dismissal  as  a  reaction  to  bringing  a  claim,  art  7),  expressly  outlaw\nvictimisation. However, cases falling outside art 7 may succeed under the general ambition  of  art\n6, which provides that member states  should  \u2018introduce  into  their  national  legal  systems  such\nmeasures as are necessary to enable all persons who consider  themselves  wronged  by  failure  to\napply to them the principle of equal treatment...to pursue their claims  by  judicial  process  ....\u2019  In\nCoote v Granada (C-185\/97) [1998] ALL ER (EC) 865, the  European  Court  of  Justice  held  (at\npara 24) that art 6 outlawed measures  taken  by  an  employer  as  a  reaction  to  proceedings  for\ndiscrimination under the Directive.\nThis formula  was  codified  in  the  Race  Discrimination  Directive  (2000\/43).  Article  9\ndemands that domestic law must \u2018protect persons from any adverse treatment  or  ...   consequence\nas a reaction to a complaint or to legal proceedings ....\u2019.\nWhether or not this could help a claimant in Khan\u2019s position depends on the  ECJ\u2019s  interpretation\nof the phrase \u2019as a reaction to\u2019. To this end, some guidance can be drawn from the ECJ  judgement\nin Coote.\nMrs Coote sued her employer following her dismissal  for  being  pregnant.  Subsequently,\nand after those proceedings were dead, the  employer  refused  to  give  her  a  reference  and  Mrs\nCoote sued again, this time for victimisation.  An  industrial  tribunal  ruled  that  section  6,  SDA\nextended discrimination only so far  as  persons  employed  by  the  defendant.  As  Mrs  Coote  no\nlonger worked for Granada when they refused the reference,  she  was  not  protected  by  the  Act.\nThe ECJ, under the Equal Treatment Directive, took a different  view,  holding  that  (at  para  24):\n\u2018Fear  of  such  measures  ...  might  deter  workers  who  considered  themselves  the   victims   of\ndiscrimination from pursuing their claims ... and  would  consequently  ...  seriously  ...  jeopardise\nimplementation of the aim pursued by the Directive.\u2019  By alluding to the  \u2018aim\u2019  of  the  legislation\nthe ECJ are more concerned with its purpose than  technicalities.  By  contrast,  the  British  courts\nhave doggedly refused to follow Coote in any matter bar that  strictly  covered  by  the  judgement\n(ie post-employment victimisation of  those  bringing  proceedings  for  sex  discrimination).  (See\nRhys-Harper v Relaxation Group [2001]  IRLR  460  (sex  discrimination  post-employment)  and\nD\u2019Souza v Lambeth LB [2001] EWCA Civ 794 (victimisation post-employment under the RRA).\nOf course, these cases are not  directly  relevant  to  Khan\u2019s.  He  was  refused  a  reference\nwhilst still employed and whilst proceedings were pending. But they do illustrate the difference in\napproach. The British courts are concerned with the precise wording of legislation (and of the ECJ\njudgement in Coote) whilst the ECJ concentrated on the purpose  of  the  legislation.  It  identified\nthe purpose of the Equal Treatment Directive  as  achieving  the  principle  of  equal  treatment  by\njudicial process. To this end, the ECJ reasoned, workers should not fear measures that would deter\nthem  from  using  the  legislation.  Following  Khan  any  worker  using   the   anti-discrimination\nlegislation can have his or her career frozen, possibly for years,  pending  proceedings,  something\nthat undermines the purpose of the legislation. It would seem that a  case  materially  the  same  as\nKhan, where the existing proceedings were for sex discrimination, could succeed in the ECJ.  This\nis, of course, no comfort for Sergeant Khan, whose case is  not  covered  by  the  Equal  Treatment\nDirective.\n4. CONCLUSION\nAt present the law on victimisation appears to be thus. For establishing  less  favourable  treatment\nthe claimant must be compared with a person who has not done the protected act, even in a  partial\nsense. It is not enough that the claimant was treated differently from that person, but it is sufficient\nif the claimant perceived, reasonably, that  the  treatment  was  less  favourable.  However,  on  the\n\u2018causative\u2019 element, an  employer  may  argue  that  he  reacted,  reasonably  and  honestly,  to  the\nexistence - not the bringing - of proceedings in order to protect  his  position.  And  so  a  claimant\nmay be  treated  less  favourably  for  the  duration  of  the  proceedings.  This  places  a  victim  of\ndiscrimination in a \u2019Khan\u2019s Fork\u2019. It may be that the employer\u2019s argument will be  defeated  if  the\nclaim includes a section 2(1)(c) protected act, which should  cover  the  existence  of  proceedings.\nAn employer may also argue that he reacted to a particular part of the protected act, eg a breach of\nconfidence (Aziz). It is probable that the  ECJ  would  take  a  different,  purposive,  approach  and\nprotect the worker in such cases, irrespective of the technicalities. But  at  present,  EC  legislation\nonly protects sex discrimination. It will extend to race by June  2003  and  religion  or  belief,  and\nsexual orientation by December 2003. The  UK  Government  has  negotiated  extensions  for  age\n(2006) and disability (2004) discrimination.\n"}
