An instrumented drop tower was used to \napply controlled impact loads of different energies to explants of bovine articular \ncartilage. Results were compared with a conventional slow stress-strain test. The \neffects of the underlying bone were investigated by progressively shortening a core of \nbone removed with the cartilage, and by gluing cartilage samples to substrates of \ndifferent moduli. The maximum dynamic modulus of isolated samples of bovine \narticular cartilage, at strain rates between 1100 and 1500 s\n-1\n, was approximately two \norders of magnitude larger than the quasistatic modulus and varied non-linearly with \napplied stress. When attached to a substrate of higher modulus, increasing the \nthickness of the substrate increased the effective modulus of the combination until a \nsteady value was achieved. A lower modulus substrate reduced the effective modulus \nof the combination. Severe impacts resulted in damage to the bone rather than to the \ncartilage. The modulus of cartilage rises rapidly and non-linearly with strain rate, \ngiving the tissue a remarkable ability to withstand impact loads. The presence of \ncartilage attenuated the peak force experienced by the bone and spread the impact \nloading period over a longer time.  \n \n \nKeywords: articular cartilage; mechanical properties; strain rate; bone, impact loading \n 3 \nIntroduction \n \nArticular cartilage provides a resilient and compliant articulating surface to the bones \nin diarthrodial joints. It protects the joint by distributing applied loads, so preventing \npotentially damaging stress concentrations, and provides a low-friction bearing \nsurface to enable free movement of the joint. Trauma is well known for increasing the \nlikelihood of articular cartilage degeneration and secondary osteoarthritis (OA). This \nmay be either acute, such as might be experienced during an automobile accident, or \nchronic, due to occupational or sporting activities [1]. Elevated levels of \nproteoglycans, stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) and collagen fragments have been found in \nthe synovial fluid at periods of up to 15 years following injury [2-4], though it is not \nclear if these are a consequence of primary damage to the cartilage that has not \nrepaired or subsequent damage due to overloading because of instability caused by \ninjury to other tissues. After injury or disease, functional tissue engineering faces the \nchallenge of trying to repair or replace damaged tissues that serve a predominantly \nmechanical function. In such applications it has been noted that is essential to \nunderstand the normal and failure properties of the native tissues under all conditions \nlikely to be experienced in vivo [5]; this includes high rates of loading. \n \nArticular cartilage may be considered as a visco- or poro-elastic fibre-composite \nmaterial and, as such, its mechanical properties depend strongly on the rate of loading. \nMost characterisation has been done using conventional materials testing machines \nand the modulus at low strain rates, and the equilibrium modulus, are well known [6-\n11]. Much less is known of its properties at high rates of loading. When walking, the \nground reaction force typically rises to a peak during the first 100 ms after heel strike \n 4 \n[12,13] and during this phase loads across the knee joint have been calculated to be \nabout three times body weight. This results in a loading rate of the order of 20 kN s\n-1\n \nand strain rates of the order of 5 s\n-1\n. To simulate trauma, it has been proposed that \nstrain rates of 1000 s\n-1\n (a deformation of 1000 thicknesses per second) were needed to \nrealistically model what happens to articular cartilage during an automobile accident \n[14]. Studies using drop towers to apply impacts to tissues have recorded strain rates \nin excess of 1000 s\n-1\n [14-16] and loading rates of the order of 100 \u2013 1000 kN s-1. A \nnumber of models have been developed to investigate the behaviour of articular \ncartilage at high strain rates, approximating to impact loads, both in vivo [17-21] and \nin vitro [22-27]. Only some of these, however, apply a true impact load, i.e. use a fast \nenough loading rate not just a large load [28].  \n \nMost commonly, tissues and materials are tested in isolation in order to understand \ntheir intrinsic properties. Only rarely, though, do they exist like this in real situations. \nArticular cartilage is firmly anchored to the underlying subchondral bone that not only \nprovides a rigid support but also prevents lateral displacements at the base of the \ntissue. Interactions between the two tissues are important mechanically and \nbiologically [29]. A reduction of the modulus of the bone is believed to spare the \noverlying cartilage from injury [30], while subchondral stiffening has been proposed \nas a cause for cartilage damage and OA, especially following impact loading [31]. In \nsupport of this, cartilage from patients with osteoporosis is often found to be in good \ncondition with few signs of osteoarthritis changes and an inverse relationship between \nOA and OP has been reported [32,33]. \n \n 5 \nThe aim of this study was to use impact loads of various energies and incident \nvelocities to measure the mechanical properties of articular cartilage, and to determine \nhow these are affected by the thickness and compliance of the underlying bone. \nIsolated bovine cartilage biopsies were subjected first to standard compression testing \nbefore being tested using a drop-tower. To investigate the interaction between \ncartilage and bone, other samples were tested in situ on bone and the depth of the \nbone was progressively reduced. In a different approach, cartilage samples were glued \nto substrates composed of cylinders of materials of different compliances and \nthicknesses. The cartilage was typically about 0.5 mm thick and cylindrical bone \ncores removed were about 10-12 mm long. \n \nMaterials and methods \n \nTissue preparation \nBovine forelimbs from animals under 24 months of age, cut above the carpal joint, \nwere obtained from the abattoir within two hours of slaughter. Up to 17 full-depth \narticular cartilage samples were removed from each medial, plateau-like, metacarpal \njoint surface using a cork borer as described previously [34]. In this study, 108 \nsamples of 5 mm diameter were used, and a further 10 of 9 mm diameter for \ncomparison with cartilage-on-bone samples. After removal, each sample was placed \nimmediately in an individual Eppendorf tube containing phosphate buffered saline \n(PBS) and allowed to equilibrate for at least 24 h as we have found this to be \nsufficient to achieve a stable mass [35]. The position of each sample on the joint \nsurface was recorded [34]. Each sample was maintained immersed in PBS except \nduring some of the measurement procedures. During these times care was taken to \nkeep the sample moistened with PBS and the duration of any exposure to air was kept \n 6 \nto a minimum. All samples were stored at \u201320 \u00b0C until required and thawed to room \ntemperature before any measurements were made. \n \nRemoving cores of bone with intact cartilage proved difficult due to the hardness of \nthe bone. The method finally adopted was first to freeze the joint at -80 \no\nC.  Cores \nwere then drilled, to a depth of about 10 mm, using a specially designed 9 mm \ndiameter coring bit (Bolton Surgical, Bolton) attached to a pillar drill, with constant \nirrigation with iced water and with the joints still frozen.  The bone cores were then \nsnapped at the base by applying pressure to the sides with a specially modified \ntrephine [36] (design courtesy of Dr M. Hurtig). After removal, the base of each \nsample was trimmed parallel with the articular surface, using a mineralogical saw \nfitted with an aluminium oxide cut-off wheel (Accutom-2, Stuers, Solihull, UK), and \nplaced in individual vials of PBS. Only two samples could be removed from the \nmedial joint surface and a total of 8 samples were tested. The position on the joint \nfrom where each sample was removed was noted. Bone cores with the cartilage \nremoved were produced from similar samples.  \n \nThe total thickness of each cartilage or cartilage-on-bone sample was measured \noptically using a Zeiss Stemi-2000 stereo microscope and AxioVision software (Zeiss \nLtd, Welwyn Garden City).  This system was calibrated using a graticule slide, \nmarked with 0.01 mm divisions, for each magnification lens of the microscope. Any \nsamples that were clearly wedge-shaped or had a non-uniform thickness were also \nidentified and removed at this stage.  \n \n 7 \nThe wet weight of the isolated cartilage samples was measured three times to \ndetermine whether there was any swelling of the tissue post-impact; just prior to \ntesting, immediately after the impact test and again 24 hours later. Weighing was \ndone, using a five-figure balance; each sample was lightly blotted between several \nlayers of tissue paper soaked in PBS, to remove excess fluid from the surface, before \nweighing it in a pre-weighed Eppendorf tube containing ~1 ml of PBS. \n \nSlow compression testing \n \nAn Instron materials testing machine (model 5564, Instron Ltd, High Wycombe) \nfitted with steel anvils was used for unconfined compression tests on cartilage \nsamples and bone plugs.  A 10 N load cell was used for the isolated cartilage samples. \nThe rate of compression was 100% strain min\n-1\n (0.0167 s\n-1\n). To ensure no damage \nwas caused to the tissue samples prior to impact loading, the peak stress was limited \nto 0.15 MPa. A 3 mm thick steel plate was placed on top of the cartilage and loaded \napplied via a ball bearing to ensure uniform loading of the sample. After testing, \nsamples were allowed to re-equilibrate in PBS for 30 minutes before impact testing. A \n2 kN load cell was used for testing the bovine bone plugs. The rate of compression \nwas chosen to be 20% strain min\n-1\n (0.0033 s\n-1\n) so that the cross-head speed was \nsimilar to that used for isolated cartilage samples. Testing was done to failure or the \ncapacity of the load cell. The stress-strain relationship was non-linear and the \nmodulus as a function of strain was found by differentiating the curve (Origin \nSoftware, Version 6.1; Aston Scientific Ltd, Stoke Mandeville). For the cartilage \nsamples the modulus, Estat, was calculated at a stress of 0.1 MPa. For the bone, Estat \nwas found at a stress of 10 MPa to enable comparisons to be made with impact test \nresults. \n 8 \n  \nImpact testing  \n \nThe drop tower and instrumentation used for impact testing have been described in \ndetail elsewhere and the data validated [37]. Briefly, a sample of known thickness was \nplaced on a stainless steel plate on top of a piezoelectric force transducer. An \nimpactor, fitted with an accelerometer, was released mechanically from a known \nheight, taking account of the specimen thickness, and fell freely onto the sample. Two \nimpactors, one weighing 100 g and the other 500 g were used in this study. An \n8702B500 accelerometer (Kistler Instruments Ltd., Alton), capable of measuring \naccelerations up to 500g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity, was used for \ntesting isolated cartilage and an 8704B5000 accelerometer, with a higher acceleration \nlimit of 5000g was found necessary for testing harder samples, such as bone and \ncartilage-on-bone samples. Data from both accelerometers and the force transducer \nwere recorded at 50 kHz. The drop heights and impactor masses for the various tests \nare shown in Table 1. \n \nImpact testing of cartilage-on-bone was performed by dropping a 100 g mass from a \nheight of 50 mm onto each 9 mm diameter sample [37]. It was found that, in general, \nthe test could be performed 3 times, with the length of the bone core bone being \nshortened by about 2 mm each time. The effective strain of the combination was \nfound by dividing the measured displacement by the total sample length. Each core \nwas of different starting length, to cover a range of lengths, and a slice of cancellous \nbone was removed first and used for slow and impact testing to determine the quasi-\nstatic and the dynamic moduli of the bone alone. Cartilage-on-bone and cartilage-on-\nsubstrate (see below) samples were held in place with a small drop of cyanoacrylate \n 9 \nglue on the base to prevent them flying out during testing. Similar tests were also \nperformed on the ten 9 mm diameter isolated cartilage samples.  \n \nTo investigate the effects of the modulus of the underlying material on the impact \nresponse, full-depth cartilage samples, 9 mm in diameter, were glued to cylinders of \nvarious materials and different lengths using cyanoacrylate adhesive. This adhesive is \neasily peeled from the cartilage explants after removal from the substrate. The \nmaterials used were brass (modulus, E = 100 GPa), Nylon (E = 3.1 GPa) and cork (E \n= 0.0035 GPa), chosen to cover a wide range of moduli. The cylinders were 9 mm in \ndiameter and 3 mm, 5 mm, 7 mm and 10 mm in length and the effective strain in the \ncombination was found as above.  The same cartilage sample was tested at all four \nlengths on a given material using a 100 g mass dropped from a height of 50 mm.  \n \nForce data were converted to engineering stress by dividing by the original cross-\nsectional area of the sample. Accelerometer data were integrated twice, to find the \ndisplacement, and divided by the original thickness of the sample, as described above, \nto determine the engineering strain [37]. The stress-strain relationship was non-linear \nand the curve for each sample was differentiated to obtain the dynamic modulus. The \nmaximum dynamic modulus, Emax, was found, and the modulus at stresses of 10 MPa \nand 5 MPa determined from the gradient at those points on the stress-strain curve to \nenable comparison of dynamic moduli at constant values of stress [35]. The mean \nstress rate and strain rate were calculated from the maximum stress or strain divided \nby the duration of the impact to that point. \n \n 10 \nThe energy of the applied impact was calculated from the mass and drop height [35]. \nA force-displacement curve was produced for loading and unloading phases. The \nenergy of deformation, Wc, was found from the area under the loading curve by \nintegrating to the maximum strain (Origin Software, Version 6.1; Aston Scientific \nLtd, Stoke Mandeville), and the energy released during restitution, Wr, by integrating \nthe unloading curve from this point back to zero strain. The square of the energetic \ncoefficient of restitution is then given by e\n*\n2\n = -Wr\/Wc [38]. A perfectly elastic \ncollision has e\n* \n= 1 and a plastic collision in which all the kinetic energy is dissipated \nhas e\n*\n = 0. \n \nStatistical tests \nData were tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with the \nsignificance level set to P = 0.05. Normally distributed data are presented as mean \u00b1 \nstandard deviation, otherwise values are shown as median [25%, 75%] confidence \nlimits. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to investigate site variation of \nproperties. Association between parameters was calculated using Spearman\u2019s rank \ncorrelation. Best subsets regression was used to measure the contribution of various \nparameters to predicting a dependent variable, e.g. the maximum dynamic modulus. \nLinear regression was used to assess the linear dependency between the variables with \nthe strongest association.  \n \nResults \n \nThickness and modulus of isolated cartilage \n \n 11 \nA typical force-displacement curve for an impact load on an isolated sample of bovine \narticular cartilage is shown in Fig. 1. The maximum strain does not coincide with the \nmaximum stress and the hatching shows the areas under the curve found by \nintegration to calculate the coefficient of restitution. There were no significant \n(ANOVA, P>0.05) topographical variations in cartilage thickness (0.56 \u00b1 0.11 mm) \nor quasistatic modulus (Estat = 0.95 \u00b1 0.20 MPa) over the medial metacarpal joint \nsurface. The values for Emax, \u03c3max and emax (Table 2) increased with drop height for \nboth the 100 g and 500 g masses. However, the dynamic modulus calculated at a \nstress of 10 MPa, E10, did not vary with location or drop height for the 100 g mass (73 \n\u00b1 14 MPa), but showed a slight increase with drop height for the 500 g mass (Table \n2). These more heavily impacted samples, however, were undoubtedly damaged; \nshowing extensive fissuring and permanent elliptical deformation immediately after \nimpact. For the 100 g impactor, the time from impactor contact to peak force was \nconsistently about 0.45 ms for all drop heights. The duration of the loading with the \n500 g impactor was longer:  time to peak force for the 25 mm drop was about 0.7 ms \nand for the 50 mm drop was about 0.5 ms. Mean stress rates and strain rates for each \ndata set are shown in Table 2. Neither the maximum dynamic modulus nor the peak \nstress was affected by the cartilage thickness for tests with the 100 g impactor.  \n \nThe mean values for the energy of deformation and the coefficient of restitution are \nshown in Table 3.  For the 100 g impacts the energy of deformation corresponded to \n94.1 \u00b1 1.2 %, and for the 500 g impacts 95.3 \u00b1 2.6 % of the theoretical impact energy \ncalculated assuming zero friction. There was no correlation between energy of \ndeformation per unit volume and cartilage thickness. Any mass lost during impact \nwas not detectable with the balance available (resolution 0.01 mg). The increase in \n 12 \nmass of the samples over the 24 hours immersed in PBS immediately following the \nimpact is also shown in Table 3.  This was small for the lowest energy impacts, \nincreased sharply following a further small increase in energy for the 100 g impactor, \nthen continued to increase more gradually with energy for the 500 g impactor.  \n \nCartilage-on-substrate samples \n \nThe maximum dynamic modulus of isolated cancellous bone slices was Emax = 302 \u00b1 \n66 MPa, mean strain rate 390  \u00b1 125 s\n-1\n. The dynamic moduli at 10 MPa (E10 = 295 \u00b1 \n60 MPa) and at 5 MPa (E5 = 233 \u00b1 44 MPa) were higher than the quasistatic modulus \nmeasured at 10 MPa (Estat = 214 \u00b1 51 MPa, strain rate 0.003 s\n-1\n). The dynamic moduli \ndecreased with decreasing sample length (Fig. 2). Similarly, impact testing of bone \nwith the cartilage in situ showed that the effective modulus of the combination, for \nsimplicity also denoted by Emax in Fig. 2, also reduced as the length of the samples \ndecreased in 6 out of the 8 samples tested. The remaining two appeared to suffer \nearlier damage and showed no consistent trend. The maximum dynamic modulus for \nthe 10 isolated 9 mm diameter cartilage cores was 32.8 \u00b1 9.1 MPa, lower than that for \nthe 5 mm diameter cores. For the same thickness of bone, the presence of cartilage \nreduced the value of the effective modulus of the combination. The energy of \ndeformation of each cartilage-on-bone sample, and that for the isolated bone cores, \nwas calculated from the area under the force-deflection curve. The coefficients of \nrestitution did not differ between cores of bone with or without cartilage present. For \nbone alone,  e\n*\n = 0.620 \u00b1 0.074 (N=12), while for cartilage-on-bone e\n*\n = 0.616 \u00b1 \n0.077 (N=24). Impact tests with the 500 g impactor from a drop height of 50 mm \ncaused consistent failure of cartilage-on-bone cores.  Samples either split vertically in \n 13 \ntwo upon impact or damage was indicated by a sudden, marked reduction in effective \nmodulus (Fig. 3). Damage was more obvious in the bone than the cartilage. \n \nAttaching cartilage samples to a substrate with a greater modulus (brass, nylon) \nincreased the effective modulus of the combination, Emax, whereas a lower substrate \nmodulus (cork) resulted in a lower effective modulus of the combination. All these, \nhowever, were dependent on the length of the substrate (Fig. 4). For all materials a \nplateau appeared to be reached when the substrate thickness was about 10 times the \nthickness of the cartilage, after which changes were small.  \n \nDiscussion \n \nThe maximum dynamic modulus of isolated samples of bovine articular cartilage, at \nmean strain rates of between 1100 and 1500 s\n-1\n, varied non-linearly with applied \nstress and was approximately two orders of magnitude larger than the modulus values \ncalculated from quasistatic compression tests. Increasing the drop height, and hence \nthe energy and speed of impact, for the 100 g mass impacts led to an increase in the \nmaximum dynamic modulus. However, the dynamic modulus calculated at a constant \nstress of 10 MPa remained approximately constant despite an increasing strain rate. \nThese data suggest that, at these large strain rates, the modulus of cartilage is \ndetermined by the stress and is insensitive to the strain rate. Similar conclusions were \ndrawn by Park et al. from experiments using cyclical loading up to 40 Hz [39] and by \nOloyede et al [40], who found the stiffness of cartilage to vary almost linearly with \nstrain rate from 10\n-5\n s\n-1\n to 10\n-2\n s\n-1\n, but to change little from 10\n-2\n s\n-1\n to 10\n3\n s\n-1\n, albeit at \n 14 \nlow stresses (0.5 MPa). This was attributed to there being two distinct regimes of \nmechanical behaviour for the cartilage governed by the rate of loading.  At low rates \nthe behaviour was dominated by fluid exudation, whereas at high loading rates the \nmatrix behaved as an elastic solid and there was no contribution from fluid flow. \nThus, the modulus tended towards a constant value as impact conditions were \napproached. The strain-rate independent modulus and the lack of fluid loss in the \nexperiments reported here are consistent with that hypothesis. The coefficient of \nrestitution, however, is considerably less than unity and does not indicate an elastic \nrebound. This could be because much higher stresses were produced by these impacts \nand tissue damage, even if not superficially apparent, could be occurring. For \nexample, the formation of internal cracks would lead to energy dissipation and plastic \nbehaviour. In contrast, the modulus of cancellous bone shows a strain-rate \ndependency. \n \nUsing the heavier, 500 g, mass the increase in impact energy and stress resulted in \nhigher values for the dynamic modulus. However, these samples were badly damaged, \nshown by extensive fissuring and by a substantial increase in mass following \nreplacement in buffer solution, due to swelling of the cartilage matrix. The damaged \nsamples assumed an elliptical shape, because the cartilage has a greater tensile \nstiffness in the direction of the preferred alignment of collagen fibrils in the \nsuperficial layer and the tissue expands less in this direction [41]. Collagen orientation \nwas not measured, but the fissures were also aligned along the short axis of the ellipse \nand presumably reflect this collagen orientation. The time to reach peak stress and \nstrain for these samples was longer then the 100 g impacts because of the greater \ninertia of the impactor.  The maximum dynamic modulus was found to be less by \n 15 \napproximately 100 MPa than that measured from equivalent impacts performed by \nJeffrey et al. [35], who reported values at a stress of 50 MPa. Judging by the \ndifferential of the stress-strain curve, however, many of the samples in the current \nstudy were already damaged by this stage. The reasons for this may be that the earlier \nmodel of the drop tower did not include a force transducer, so forces were calculated \nassuming a frictionless drop, and the data acquisition rate was slower, possibly \nleading to inaccuracies in strain calculation. Together these could overestimate the \nstress and underestimate the strain resulting in an overestimate of the modulus. \n \nThe energy absorbed by the samples did not vary significantly with the small \nvariation in thickness. With an increase in impact energy, the decreasing coefficient of \nrestitution indicated that the impacts became more plastic in nature. This could be \nindicative of increasing amounts of damage in the samples as both the formation of \ncracks and permanent deformation might be expected to absorb greater amounts of \nenergy. The extreme case was the 500 g impact from a height of 50 mm. This \nproduced extensive damage and, compared with the 100 g impacts, approximately 5 \ntimes more energy per unit volume was absorbed by the samples.  \n \nThere were no differences in cartilage thickness, quasistatic modulus or dynamic \nmodulus values for samples removed from different sites over the bovine medial \nmetacarpal joint surface. Similar results have been reported previously for thickness \nand quasistatic modulus, despite significant variations in collagen, glycosaminoglycan \nand water contents [34]. This study extends the range of strain rates and, though \ncomposition was not measured in this case, supports the hypothesis that interactions \nbetween matrix components are at least as important as their concentrations for \n 16 \ndetermining the mechanical properties of the tissue, as might be expected for fibre-\ncomposite materials [34,42]. \n \nAll the cartilage samples were subjected to slow compression tests followed by an \nimpact load after sample recovery.  In this study, the sample thickness had no effect \non the maximum dynamic modulus values for the bovine cartilage but did affect the \nquasistatic modulus. Unconfined compression testing is, in theory, a measure of the \nintrinsic properties of the material under test and should not be affected by sample \ndimensions. However, this assumes no friction between the sample and the platens \nused to compress it. Friction will restrict the lateral expansion of the sample, which in \nturn has the effect of making the sample appear stiffer than it should since a higher \ncompressive force is needed to deform a specimen by a given amount [43]. In \naddition the aspect ratio (height\/ diameter) of the samples used for this study is of the \norder of 0.1.  Ideally, this ratio should be about one, but this is not a practical \npossibility for specimens of cartilage. A small aspect ratio would make the specimen-\nplaten considerations even more significant, and an indication of this problem may be \nindicated by the lower dynamic modulus found for the 9 mm diameter cores \ncompared with the 5 mm cores. These issues, however, do not seriously impair the \ncomparative nature of the tests in this study as all samples were subjected to the same \ntesting regime. Despite these limitations, it is clear that the quasistatic modulus of the \ncartilage samples is considerably smaller than the modulus measured at higher strain \nrates and during an impact. This should be taken into consideration when building \nfinite element models to simulate walking or injury and provides a challenging goal \nfor tissue-engineered constructs to emulate these properties. \n \n 17 \nThe behaviour of cartilage in vivo cannot be considered in isolation from the bone to \nwhich it is firmly attached.  Mechanical testing of the combination, however, then \nbecomes difficult. Ideally, we should like to know the strain in both the cartilage and \nthe substrate and pilot studies using a high-speed camera indicate that, in future, it \nmay be possible to measure these. In this study, measuring strain in the cartilage itself \nwhile on bone or a substrate was not attempted and hence the stiffness values can only \nbe for the combination. In addition, because the properties of bone vary between \nindividuals, and even between sites in one individual, we tried to do repeated tests on \neach core, varying the length between tests. It is possible that damage would \naccumulate before it became obvious but the trends shown were consistent in most \nsamples, the aberrant ones we discarded on the basis that damage had likely occurred. \nDuring impact, though, the modulus of cartilage is of the same order of magnitude as \nthat of the bone, so the mismatch between bone and cartilage is not as great as might \nbe believed from quasi-static testing when there is a difference of two orders of \nmagnitude. Not surprisingly, increasing the modulus of the substrate increases the \nmeasured dynamic stiffness of the combination. Similarly, as the length of the \nsubstrate increased the modulus of the combination increased but appears to reach a \nsteady value which is lower than the modulus of the isolated material. Finite element \nmodelling, albeit of quasi-static loading, has indicated that increasing the modulus of \nthe substrate has little effect on stresses in the cartilage and that the modulus and \nthickness of the cartilage were the dominant factors determining the stresses in the \nsubchondral bone [29]. The damage to the bone found for the most severe impacts is \nevidence in favour of this analysis. What the cartilage does do is prevent very high \nlocal stresses occurring. Although it is thin and stiff it provides a cushioning surface \nover the bone, as shown by the attenuating and prolonging effect of the cartilage on \n 18 \nthe measured forces. It also appears to have better crack-stopping properties and is \nless prone to obvious damage. \n \nArticular cartilage appears to behave as a quasi-elastic material at high strain rates \nproviding the stress is not too high; i.e. it has a constant modulus at a given stress \nindependent of strain rate. Its modulus, however, is non-linearly dependent on the \napplied stress and is approximately two orders of magnitude greater than traditionally \nreported, not much smaller than the modulus of the underlying cancellous bone. In \nsitu on bone, the modulus of the combination reaches a constant value when the bone \nthickness exceeds about 10 times the cartilage thickness. Under these conditions, \nsevere impacts produce damage in the bone rather than the cartilage.  \n 19 \nAcknowledgments \n \nWe thank the Arthritis Research Campaign for funding these studies (grant A0542) \nand the staff at Macintosh Donald, Portlethen, for kindly providing bovine forelimbs. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 20 \nReferences \n \n 1.
