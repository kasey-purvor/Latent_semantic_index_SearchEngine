However, many \npractices from below resist, reject or at least disrupt the stringent property rights \nregime and the primacy of the market, two core elements of neoliberal ideology. \nSome of these practices of resistance are in the form of a disruption to or rejection of \nthe commodity exchange model. In this article we address three modes of sharing in \na digital context, embedded in a cultural exchange model \u2013 sharing code, sharing \ncontent and sharing access. These different practices of giving and sharing are \nanalyzed according to the way reciprocity is articulated, the extent to which they \ndisrupt the capitalist model of commodity exchange, and the ways in which they \ninteract or not with it. We conclude that all forms of digital sharing involve degrees of \nreciprocity, and that all sharing in digital contexts is gradually appropriated by \ncapitalist logics, mainly through the creation of auxiliary revenues. Many sharing \npractices do not intend to reject or disrupt, so, while some sharing practices might \nconstitute a (partial) disruption to the commodity exchange model, they may not \nnecessarily result in its negation. Recent attempts by states and parts of the \nentertainment industry to discipline or coerce the revivified participatory culture and \nits cultural exchange ethic, to fit the commodity exchange model raises serious \nconcerns.  \n \nKeywords: dialectics, gift-economies, open source, file sharing, universal access \n \nWord count: 8019 (refs and notes included) \n \n  2 \nDisruptive Sharing in a Digital Age: \nRejecting Neoliberalism? \n \n \n\u2018every pleasure which emancipates itself from exchange-value takes on subversive features\u2019 \n(Adorno 2002 [1938], 297) \n \n \n1. Introduction \n \nWhilst the state and social democracy were once considered to be corrective and \nsafeguards against the crude and individualistic whims of the market, they now very \nmuch embody and personify neoliberal values and core principles. Harvey (2005) \nopposes the social democratic state, promoting the well-being of all citizens, full \nemployment and the redistribution of wealth to the contemporary neoliberal state, \nwhose remit is reduced to maximizing the conditions for capital accumulation and \ndefending property rights, business interests and the primacy of the market.  \n \n\u017di\u017eek (2008, 189) argues that the reformist left \u2013 in Europe as well as in the US \u2013 by \nadopting the third-way ideology, has consolidated the neoliberal revolution that was \nled by Reagan and Thatcher in the 1980s: \u2018Thatcher was not a Thatcherite, she was \njust herself \u2013 it was Blair (more than John Major) who truly forged Thatcherism as a \nnotion\u2019. Drawing on Hegel, \u017di\u017eek calls this an example of the negation of the \nnegation, \u2018a victory in defeat: it occurs when one\u2019s specific message is accepted as a \nuniversal framework, even by the enemy\u2019 (ibid), turning contingency into necessity. \nEven after the deep systemic crisis in the deregulated financial system and the \nsubsequent massive bailout by tax-payers and states this sublation has allowed the \nneoliberal paradigm and ideology to position itself as unquestionable, as a synthesis, \nan absolute \u2013 hence the signaling \u2018the end of history\u2019 (Fukuyama, 1992) or claims that \nleft and right no longer exist. In other words, neoliberalism, as an ideology and as a \npractice, has managed to negate its negation, namely socialism and communism.  \n \nThis ties in with the Gramscian notion of hegemony, a manufactured consensus, a \ncollective will, involving a struggle for \u2018moral, cultural, intellectual and, thereby, \npolitical leadership over the whole society\u2019 (Bennett, Mercer and Woollacott 1986, \nxiv). Despite this, history teaches that hegemony is \u2018a mode of control that has to be \nfought for constantly in order to maintain it\u2019 (Giroux 1981, 17); as such, it can never \nbe ultimately fixed or made permanently self-evident (Laclau and Mouffe 1985, 111).  \n \nSince the neoliberal state and its democratic institutions have become caught up in \nthe protection of corporate and other elite interests, many alternatives that challenge \nthe capitalist paradigm are being developed bottom-up, through the establishment of \ntemporary autonomous or at times even illicit zones, and through the displacement \nof commodity exchange by a culture of giving and sharing (Bey 1991\/2003). While \nthere seems to be no convincing alternative grand narrative capable of challenging \nneoliberalism, in the everyday lives of activists, citizens and even consumers we \nobserve an abundance of micro practices that reject and\/or deterritorialize the \narbolic capitalist structures, some of which constitute serious threats from the micro \nto the macro (Deleuze and Guatari 1987).  \n \nThree such disruptive practices centered on the digital culture of sharing are \naddressed here: 1) sharing of code, 2) sharing of digital content and 3) sharing of \naccess. All these practices involve forms of giving and receiving, which inevitably \nimplicates theories of traditional gift economies. In his classic anthropological study \n  3 \nThe Gift, Mauss (1950 [2005]) stresses the centrality of reciprocity in relation to the \nact of giving and refutes the idea that the act of giving is ever without strings.  \n \nAnalysis of these three forms of sharing in a digital context highlights the ways in \nwhich reciprocity is articulated, the extent to which these different practices of giving \nand sharing disrupt the capitalist logic of commodity exchange, and the ways in \nwhich they interact with it or not. First we juxtapose different approaches to giving \nand sharing in the material world to these actions in an immaterial digital context.  \n \n2. Giving and sharing in the mediated age \n \nIn theories of traditional gift economies, power and symbolic capital play pivotal \nroles in the dialectic between giving and receiving. Some individuals are in a position \nto give more than others and, as Mauss (1950 [2005], 83) points out, \u2018[c]harity is still \nwounding for him who has accepted it\u2019. As a result, receiving in a material world \noften leads to the reinforcement of social relations, the cementing of social \ndependencies and the reproduction of the existing power relations.  \n \nThis intrinsic linking of the gift to the obligation to reciprocate, and the emphasis on \nthe two-dimensional power relationship between giver and receiver highlighted by \nMauss, has been challenged by several authors. Hyde (1979 [1983]), for example, \ndifferentiates between true and false gifts: the former is given out of gratitude and the \nlatter out of obligation. Cheal (1988) positions the act of giving in relation to \nfriendship, love, strong ties and dependencies. Thus, these authors disassociate the \nact of giving from the need for reciprocity by stressing a belief in genuine generosity \nand altruism as the basis of giving.  \n \nOthers find this problematic and try to articulate a distinction from the traditional \ngift economy, rife with the issues of reciprocity, power and the culture of sharing, to a \nsituation less conditioned by the need for reciprocity. Sharing inevitably involves \ngiving and receiving, but, according to Belk (2007, 127), it can be positioned as the \nabsolute antipode of commodity exchange and involves no expectation of reciprocity. \nBelk proposes a continuum where \u2018commodity exchange lies at one end and sharing \nat the other, with gift giving somewhere in the middle\u2019. Belk (2007, 128) goes on to \nconnect commodity exchange with egoism, stinginess and impersonality, while \nidentifying genuine altruism, generosity and personality as core characteristics of \nideal-type sharing. Gift economies, then, combine aspects of both ends of the \ncontinuum and therefore, as pointed out above, are more ambiguous.  \n \nSharing in the material world is seen as a highly interpersonal process, self evident, \nunquestioned rather than ritualized and contested as in the case of a gift. This \ndifference is exposed linguistically through the use of the words receiving\/accepting \na gift and taking something that is being shared. Considering giving and sharing in a \ndigital environment opens up an array of new opportunities in terms of fostering a \nculture of giving and sharing. Kollock (1999, 223) argues that many of the problems \nassociated with giving and receiving in offline communities, can be overcome in \nonline communities. He argues that the emergence of digital technologies and the \ninternet has greatly reduced the costs associated with giving and sharing, and the \nscale of sharing has no consequences for its cost.  \n \nHowever, the nature of what is being shared \u2013 immaterial goods - is undoubtedly as \nimportant as the technology that enables its sharing. Digital immaterial goods are a \npotent illustration of what Mandel (1975) calls \u2018total automation\u2019 in pointing to the \npossibility to reproduce something infinitely without generating additional labour \ncosts. This potential of infinite digital reproduction enables a reconnection with older \n  4 \nforms of cultural exchange; it transforms the digitized content into something like \nspeech, and as we know \u2018[t]he model of consumption does not fit practices of speech \nor singing\u2019 (Poster 2004, 417).  \n \nAlso, sharing in a mediated and digital space as opposed to in the material world, is \nfed by the collective strength of (often very) weak ties in densely networked \nenvironments; it somehow links individual action and gain to collectivism without \nwhich the individual would gain nothing. Despite this, the existence of strong ties \nremains a quintessential condition for some particular forms of digital sharing \nrequiring trust and\/or expertise. Thus, ties in relation to giving and sharing in a \ndigital environment are perhaps not so different from giving and sharing ties in \neveryday life. As Haythornthwaite (2002, 387) reminds us: \n \n\u2026 ties of various strengths, with their different ranges and access to resources, fill \nimportant niches in our daily work and lives. The dual usefulness of strong and weak \nties begins to provide some explanation for the impacts of new media. \n \nThis parallel between the offline and online in terms of ties, holds also in relation to \nthe online reproduction of power-relations prevalent in the offline. For example, as \nargued elsewhere, web 2.0 has been almost fully appropriated and integrated in the \ncapitalist hegemony (Cammaerts 2008).  \n \nBoth state and market actors may attempt to appropriate or co-opt disruptive \npractices or use repression to stop them completely. Some forms of sharing are more \nvulnerable than others to the tactics of co-option and repression. At the same time, \nthese interventions of state and market on disruptive practices of sharing are not \nnecessarily detrimental and potentially might be productive.  \n \nThree modes of disruptive sharing in digital environments are developed here \u2013 \nsharing code, sharing digital content, and sharing access1, Each is disruptive in some \nway, but also exhibits strategies of co-option by capitalist interests.  \n \n3. Disruptive Sharing Practices  \n \n\u2018Information wants to be free\u2019 was one of the most pervasive phrases invoked by the \nearly hacker movement, highlighting its ethics of open access to information and \n(technical) knowledge. However, the second phrase \u2013 \u2018Information also wants to be \nexpensive\u2019 (Brand 1987, 202) \u2013 is often forgotten. In essence, we are confronted by a \npermanent tension and conflict between open access and exclusivity, between \ncultural exchange and commodity exchange, which is in line with well-known \ncapitalist strategies of constantly attempting to create scarcity. At the same time, \nthere are those who take a more normative stance saying that \u2018information ought to \nbe free\u2019, and viewing information and knowledge as more than a mere product or \ntradable commodity. Such advocates of the public domain argue that \u2018different \nprinciples should govern the creation of property rights in information\u2019 (Mansell and \nSteinmueller 2002, 298). \n \nThe three modes of disruptive sharing addressed here are related, therefore, to a \nmore fundamental debate around the sharing of and access to information and \nhuman knowledge, and the longstanding legacy in the sciences of a cultural exchange \nmodel. Similarly, culture has a long tradition of sharing geared towards diffusing \nideas, songs, stories, which, above all, take place outside of the value-chain (Jenkins \n2003). \n \n  5 \nRejecting the commodity transaction model in terms of access to information and \nknowledge, and foregrounding a cultural exchange model, however, is not so \nstraightforward. Mansell and Steinmueller (2002) point to the legal constraints: \ncopyright and patent laws are fairly ubiquitous for newly produced content, and laws \ntend to dutifully protect the property regime. The authors also identify an opening for \nmarket actors to embrace the cultural exchange model by generating indirect or \nauxiliary revenues.  \n \nThe first two modes of disruptive sharing \u2013 of code and digital content \u2013 to some \nextent defy the logic of commodity exchange, of private property, prevalent in the \nmaterial world. In so doing they counter a propriety culture with a participatory \nculture marked by distinct cultural exchange models. However, this is not to imply \nthat the market is absent, since the facilitation of these participatory practices or the \ndistribution of the free good become ways of generating indirect revenues through \nsubscriptions, premiums, service contracts or online advertising.   \n \nPerhaps paradoxically, we address sharing access to the internet as an infrastructure \nlast, although in many ways it can be seen as the pre-condition for having access to \nopen source software and networks, and to digital content, propriety or not. \nHowever, in this paper, access to the infrastructure is approached not merely in \nterms of extending the possibilities for sharing of information and knowledge in the \nform of digital code and digital content, but also as a vulnerability, a locus that can \ndisrupt the disruptions which the sharing of code and of content represent. \n \nSharing code  \n \nThe conflict between the hacking culture of early computing and programming and \nthe propriety software industry erupted at a very early stage. It was Bill Gates who \nfirst accused the computer hobbyist community of theft and parasitic behavior in an \nopen letter to the Homebrew Computer Club Newsletter. \n \nAs the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software. \nHardware must be paid for, but software is something to share. Who cares if the \npeople who worked on it get paid? [\u2026] One thing you do do is prevent good software \nfrom being written. Who can afford to do professional work for nothing? (Gates 1976, \n2) \n \nThe Free\/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) movement has proven Gates to \nbe wrong. Much free software has turned out to be more stable and less plagued by \nbugs than comparable commercial products developed by companies such as Gates\u2019s \nMicrosoft. The FLOSS movement has been and continues to be a robust competitor \nto propriety software development at the global level.  \n \nAbout 67% of the 1 million busiest websites worldwide run on Apache open source \noperating systems, while Microsoft\u2019s share of server-market is a mere 17% (Netcraft \n2010). Many companies have introduced open source software to reduce costs. For \nexample, since 2001, the online bookseller Amazon has run entirely on the Linux OS, \nwhich has reduced its operating costs by about 25% (Shankland, Kane and Lemos \n2001). Many universities and university libraries worldwide have adopted open \nsource software solutions for databases, catalogues, intranets and teaching platforms. \nAnd in the developing world, many public institutions in Latin America, Asia and \nAfrica have migrated to open source software and are actively supporting open source \nsoftware development (C\u00e2mara and Fonseca 2007).  \n \nIn 1989 Richard Stallman developed the General Public License (GPL) to suit the \nparticular needs of the then burgeoning Free Software Movement. A Copyleft license, \n  6 \nas these came to be known, uses \u2018copyright law, but flips it over to serve the opposite \npurpose\u2019 (Stallman 1999, 59). Information is not just placed in the public domain; \ncopyright law ensures that it remains public.  \n \nAs a reaction to the radical GPL protection of the public domain from commercial \nexploitation and commodification, other more flexible licenses were introduced, \nwhich were more accommodating to market needs and, thus, opened the door to \nappropriation. These \u2018open source\u2019 - rather than free - public licenses impose fewer \nrestrictions on what the commercial user can do with the material. Open source \nlicenses are seen as being more business friendly precisely because, while they often \nallow redistribution under GLP, they do not always require it (S\u00f6derberg 2002). This \nis the reason there is some degree of propriety code embedded in most popular open \nsource software programs.  \n \nOpen source licenses have enabled parts of the corporate sector to support and invest \nin open source software development. Examples are endorsement of the FLOSS \nmovement by IBM and Intel, among others, and successful open source companies \nsuch as Red Hat and Cygnus, along with the increased use of open source software in \nthe private sector. Many companies have become highly profitable by providing \nauxiliary services geared towards open source software, such as customizing certain \nplatforms or databases, packaging, installation or fixing problems. Co-option of the \nFOSS movement and parts of its ethics by corporate actors and interests, is not in \nitself necessarily bad. According to S\u00f6derberg (2007, 36), \u2018activists should not forget \nthat the pragmatic attitude of hackers towards commercial involvement partly \nexplains their stunning success\u2019.  \n \nThe growing involvement in the FLOSS movement of the corporate sector raises \nareas of contention related to labor, remuneration and coders\u2019 personal motivations \nfor sharing their labor in collective and collaborative projects (Terranova 2000; \nLancashire 2001 [2005]; Benkler 2006; S\u00f6derberg 2007). Achievement of social and \nsymbolic capital \u2013reputation and recognition within the movement \u2013 is often a \npowerful motive for coders to engage in open source projects. Collaboration and \nactive contribution to an open source project can strengthen the software \nprogrammer\u2019s CV or improve access to venture capital (Weber 2000, 25). Some \nsoftware companies allocate time for their programmers to work in collaborative \nopen source projects to speed up their problem solving. Altruism, therefore, is not the \nonly motivation of FLOSS developers. As Berguist and Ljungberg (2001, 313) point \nout: \n \ngiving digital gifts does not remove the interdependencies between givers and \nreceivers. But social relationships and obligations between the parties involved in the \nexchange are restructured based on the character of digital information and the \nInternet as a social world. \n \nThe FLOSS movement clearly has benefited societies by developing free software and \nmaking it accessible to a global public, and by devising a legal mechanism to keep \nfree content firmly in the public domain. The disruptive impact of the FLOSS \nmovement remains significant, but has been mostly neutralized by corporate actors. \nAlso, the FLOSS movement operates within the copyright regime, even though it \nperverts it to protect the public domain. In the discussion on sharing digital content \nwe show how the copyright regime is firmly rejected. One of the founders of The \nPirate Bay describes it not as copyleft but as copyriot (Fleischer 2008).  \n \n \n  \n  7 \nSharing digital content \n \nAs mentioned earlier, the sharing of cultural content and scientific knowledge is not a \nnew phenomenon; it was quintessential to human development and advancement in \npre-industrial societies. In industrial and post-industrial society several technologies \nand their potential to reproduce poetry, literature, paintings, music and later films, \nhave contributed to the commodification of culture and increased the possibilities for \nsharing culture. With the emergence of digitalization, however, the scale of sharing \nchanged radically. While pre-digitalization, the sharing of cultural content often \noccurred between strong peers, digitalization means it takes place in a context of \n(very) weak ties and on a global scale. \n \nIt is not only the scope of sharing that has increased exponentially as a result of \ndigitalization, but also the breadth of what is available online. Advanced compression \ntechniques, the emergence of decentralized peer-to-peer interfaces, encryption and \nspecialist blogs linked to massive filesharing sites, have led to a situation where \nalmost any digital \u2018product\u2019 \u2013 whether propriety software, music, e-books, magazines, \nfilms, TV shows and even live sport broadcasts - can be found, watched, read, listened \nto, shared and copied globally.  \n \nTwo types of sharing of digital content can be differentiated. Decentralized peer-to-\npeer filesharing refers to anonymous \u2018peers\u2019, who share digital content, computer to \ncomputer, mediated by a bit-torrent protocol rather than a central server. This \nphenomenon has facilitated \u2018the easy spread of content in a way unimagined a \ngeneration ago\u2019 (Lessig 2004, 17). With this type of filesharing, whenever you are \ndownloading you are simultaneously uploading, which makes taking, in a peer-to-\npeer context, inescapably altruistic whilst also being individualistic. This type of \nsharing has proven difficult to co-opt or repress due to its global and fragmented \nnature and, therefore, represents one of the greatest challenges for the neoliberal \nproperty rights regime.  \n \nThe second form of filesharing occurs through commercial filesharing sites, which \nenable bloggers, aggregators and crackers to upload large (encrypted) files and\/or \nmake links to the content accessible to those who follow a particular blog, or enable \nthe streaming of live TV broadcasts. Bloggers receive kudos for their labours to make \naccessible what is often obscure content, that is difficult to get hold of in the material \nworld. They are seen by some as performing the activity of archiving and enriching \nthe public domain (Bruns 2010). Filesharing sites popular with bloggers and \naggregators, such as RapidShare, FileServe or Hotfile, operate premium services and \nboth music and software blogs as well as the filesharing sites often host quite \naggressive online advertising. Websites, such as V-Share, Livestream, Justin TV or \nUstream, facilitate the streaming of live TV and, again, host excessive online \nadvertising and offer premium services. \n \nNevertheless, the practice of sharing digital content online, in combination with total \nautomation, in many ways rejects the current copyright regime, which is enmeshed in \n(intellectual) property rights \u2013 one of the cornerstone of the neoliberal paradigm. \nSteinmueller (2008, 17) in this context refers to the \u2018copyright-crisis era\u2019. This \nexplains the current heavy handedness of the entertainment industries in trying to \ndiscipline the sharing of digital content online through repression and scare tactics, \nand also through lobbying governments to adopt ever more stringent and intrusive \nlegislation (Alliance Against IP Theft 2008; RIAA 2009).  \n \nIn the context of the music industry, lobby organizations claim that labels and their \nartists lost more than US$ 40 bn in revenue in 2008 due to piracy and what they \n  8 \nconsider illicit downloads (IFPI 2009: 22). They argue also that the total disregard of \nthe consumer for the rights of copyright holders and creators not only causes serious \ndamage to the music and entertainment industry, but ultimately will be detrimental \nto the diversity of cultural and creative production. Econometrics scholars, such as \nZentner (2006) and Liebowitz (2006), support these arguments with empirical data; \nothers reject these claims pointing to evidence that contradicts these gloomy \nprojections, differentiating between activities within and sub-sections of the music \nindustry and between different types of downloaders (Molteni and Ordanini 2003; \nRob and Waldfogel 2006; Oberholzer and Strumpf 2007; Bhattacharjee, et al. 2007).  \n \nWhile it is generally accepted that projections of the losses due to peer-to-peer \nsharing of music are greatly exaggerated by lobby organizations, mainly because it is \nnot realistic to assume that all the cultural products downloaded would otherwise \nhave been purchased (Liebowitz 2006, 13), it is undeniable that the music industry \ngenerally, is struggling. While revenues for legal downloads may have soared2, this \ndoes not compensate for lost sales of more highly priced CDs. It is debatable, \nhowever, whether this crisis is attributable to filesharing as such, or whether some \nbroader societal causes need also to be taken into account. As Leyshon, et al. (2006, \n181) argue:  \n \n[T]he problems facing the music industry have not suddenly been manifested \novernight, or even in response to on-line digital file exchange, but rather have \naccumulated over time in response to a set of broader cultural forces that have \nchanged the role of music within society, and relegated its immediacy and importance \namong many of its consumers. \n \nMusic in the form of a digital file turns into something \u2018ephemeral, its duration \nbecomes compressed, and it becomes more of a process than a finished product\u2019 \n(Terranova 2000, 48), which can be seen as reconnecting with a more traditional \nform of enjoying and sharing culture. The ubiquity of music in everyday life, the \nmassive increase in releases catering to a multiplicity of genres and sub-genres, and \nlimits on families\u2019 entertainment budgets, are all contributing to changing attitudes \nto music and its consumption. Furthermore, most filesharers although aware that \ntheir behavior constitutes an infringement, do not perceive it as morally wrong \n(Hietanen, Huttunen and Kokkinen 2008). \n \nFrom the perspective of audiences or rather copyright users, it should be \nacknowledged also that digital filesharing has enabled many people to discover and \nto explore music, and have much more extensive and eclectic music collections than \nthey could have afforded to buy. Thus, Oberholzer and Strumpf (2007, 40) conclude \nthat \u2018[t]he sheer magnitude of P2P activity, the billions of songs downloaded each \nyear, suggests that the added social welfare from filesharing is likely to be high\u2019. \nSimilarly, Currah (2006, 443) points out that filesharing has \u2018facilitated much greater \nuser participation in what had previously been an arcane \u201cgift economy\u201d dominated \nby enthusiasts and hobbyists\u2019.  \n \nMore and more artists and music labels are embracing and making full use of the file-\nsharing logic (Williamson and Cloonan 2007). It has enable (some) artists to develop \ndirect relationships with their fans exploiting a revivified and vibrant participatory \nculture. Positive exposure, in the form of brand recognition, notoriety and fame, \nwhich draw audiences to concerts, is important, but so also is the so-called sampling \neffect of people buying music discovered through downloading (Oberholzer and \nStrumpf 2007: 38). The revenues from live performances increasingly are shared \nbetween artist and record label; many labels act as booking agents for their artists, \nand the proceeds flow back into new releases (Webb 2007). Some labels have \ndeveloped innovative models of publishing music exclusively online under creative \n  9 \ncommons licenses and accepting donations; a good example here is the Sheffield \nnetlabel Planet Terror Records3, but there are many others.  \n \nAs with the case of the FLOSS movement, sharing digital content presents a mixed \nand confused picture. Because of its success and ease, but also because of its partial \nrejection of the property and commodity exchange regime, the sharing of immaterial \ndigital content is one of the most disruptive forms of sharing. The gift economy of \nonline file sharing is rife with implicit and explicit reciprocities. Peer-to-peer \nnetworks employ a form of enforced reciprocity, while commercial filesharing sites \nfeed off the altruistic practices of aggregators, bloggers and hackers who invest much \ntime and energy into recording, transferring, uploading, archiving and converting \ndigital content for others to enjoy for free. Specialist bloggers can obtain kudos and \naccumulate social capital from their micro-audiences.  \n \nAt the same time, tension is rising between what Jenkins (2003) called the \nparticipatory culture, which reconnects with older forms of cultural diffusion and the \npersistent efforts of states and lobby organizations to close loopholes and criminalize \nor repress certain practices that are an inherent part of this participatory culture. \nRecent regulatory initiatives in the UK and other countries to counter filesharing by \nmonitoring online behaviour and penalizing offenders have serious implications for \nprivacy online and for the information and communication rights of citizens \n(Banerjee, et al. 2008). They are also likely to be detrimental to the revitalization of \nthe participatory culture and the innovation it represents. Also these initiatives are \nlikely to fuel the ongoing turf war between the industry and hackers by bypassing \ntechnical means of protection and detection (Collins and Mansell 2005).  \n \nSharing Access \n \nAccess to internet infrastructures has always been high on the policy agenda. \nHowever, internet access policy has been framed mostly from a technologically \ndeterministic perspective of a linear trajectory from access to the internet, to ICT-\nskills training geared first to employment and, ultimately, to socio-economic \ninclusion. Integral to the early digital divide policies was the establishment of so-\ncalled public access points (Xavier 1997; Lentz, et al. 2000). In line with the \ndeterminist positions of policymakers, public access points were positioned in public \nspaces, such as employment or welfare benefit offices, and public libraries, allowing \nthose on the wrong side of the divide to be reached easily (European Commission \n2001, 18). However, studies have shown that social exclusion is a complex \nphenomenon and that access to an information and communication infrastructure is \nby no means the miracle solution to social inclusion and social cohesion (Norris \n2001; Mansell 2002; Cammaerts, et al. 2003). \n \nToday, public access to the internet increasingly is being provided by both municipal \nand private actors through public Wi-Fi services. Municipalities often legitimate state \nsponsored public provision as essential to attract tourists, stimulate the local \nbusiness sector and\/or cater to a young and media savvy urban population (Bar and \nPark 2006; Forlano 2008; Josgrilberg 2008). In the private sector, there is a \nmultiplicity of commercial spaces providing free public wireless access, from brands \nsuch as Starbucks and McDonalds, to small local caf\u00e9s, bars and bookshops (Forlano \n2008; Hartmann 2009). This invites strategies of resistance by so-called \u2018wireless \nsquatters\u2019, and encourages those providing the wireless access to make its users buy \nsomething (Hampton and Gupta 2008). \n \nAs Barranca\u2019s (2004) Gramscian triad of commercial wireless broadband (market), \nmunicipal wireless broadband (state) and community broadband networks (civil \n  10 \nsociety) implies, a third, community-based approach to providing access through Wi-\nFi networks, has emerged, and is the focus of this part of the discussion. Community \nwireless networks, unlike municipal and commercial wireless networks, are bottom-\nup, grassroots initiatives providing Wi-Fi access. As Table 1 shows, there are some \nmajor differences within the community wireless sector, and various degrees of \nappropriation are apparent.  \n \n \nTable 1: Different models of community wireless networks \n \nType: Characteristics: Example: \nIndividual Wireless \nProviders \nConsciously or unconsciously \nleaving your network \nunsecured, decentralized \n- \nRadical Wireless \nNetworks \nnon commercial, copyleft, \npeer2peer culture, no \nintermediaries, decentralized \nhttp:\/\/www.reseaucitoyen.be\n\/ - Brussels (Belgium) \nCommunity Owned \nWireless Networks \nnot for profit, organizationally \nstructured, also hold a lobby \nfunction for open internet, \noften centralized \nhttp:\/\/www.nycwireless.net\/  \n- New York (US) \nPrivately Sponsored \nCommunity Wireless \nNetworks \nnot for profit, but yes to private \nsponsorship, often centralized \nhttp:\/\/wirelessantwerpen.be\/ \n- Antwerp (Belgium) \nPrivately Owned \nCommunity Wireless \nNetworks \ncommercial models with social \ngain aims and outcomes  \nhttp:\/\/www.southwitham.net\n\/6.html South Witham \nBroadband Ltd. (UK) \n \nFirst, some people deliberately leave their wireless connection unsecured, enabling \nthe very local community \u2013 immediate neighbors \u2013 to access the internet for free. \nOthers might leave their connection unsecured due to a of lack of technical skills or \nknowledge that it can be secured. The net result is that a considerable number of \npeople can access the internet through the unsecured Wi-Fi broadband connections \nof others.  \n \nWhile more organized, radical Wi-Fi networks are also highly decentralized, and aim \nto weave together a tapestry of individuals that can share part of these private \nbroadband connections through an open source protocol, thus providing more \nprotection to those who share their access. An interesting example of such a radical \nWi-Fi project is R\u00e9seau Citoyen in Brussels (see Carpentier 2008). It was launched in \n2000 and its website says: \n \nWe consider that equality between citizens is important and therefore some technical \nchoices are excluded as they would imply that some systems would have to play a \npreeminent role. Each citizen is represented by a router, and no router should be able \nto control others. [\u2026] We exclusively evolve in the non-commercial world. The \ncommercial world may be our neighbour, sometimes our partner but never our \nmaster.4 \n \nHartmann (2009, 432) considers a similar case in Germany, the Freifunk network, \nwhich aims to foster \u2018a democratization of communication media and better local \nsocial networks through the sharing of Wi-Fi resources that further the development \nof more open networks\u2019. This latter aspect \u2013 an allegiance to open source and open \ninternet \u2013 is crucial to radical Wi-Fi networks. \n \nCommunity owned wireless networks are even more structured organizationally, and \nat times also function as (local) lobby organizations; they are often inextricably \n  11 \nembedded in and\/or connected to the local civil society ecology. They are \u2018examples \nof the way in which the community form of organizing can be applied in the area of \ntelecommunications infrastructure albeit on a relatively small scale\u2019 (Forlano 2008, \n3). New York Wireless is a typical case of a localized community-based wireless \nnetwork that aims to \u2018work with public and other nonprofit organizations to bring \nbroadband wireless Internet to under-served communities\u2019 and also sees itself as an \n\u2018advocacy group for wireless community networking\u20195. There exist a variety of ways in \nwhich access is provided, depending on local circumstances. Community-based Wi-Fi \nprojects are often connected to similar initiatives across the globe through \ntransnational networks, enabling the sharing of knowledge, open source software and \ndifferent models for providing local access6. \n  \nPrivately sponsored community wireless networks are proud of their not-for-profit \nethic in providing access to the internet, but associate themselves with the private \nsector in the form of direct partnerships, or through sponsorship and advertising. \nPrivately sponsored community wireless networks favour linear connections between \npowerful nodes above the more anarchist tapestry of connections enabling radical \nand parts of the community owned models. The case of WirelessAntwerpen, \ndescribed by Carpentier (2008) which recently became WirelessBelgi\u00eb, is a good \nexample of such a not-for-profit organization that is (partially) sponsored by the \nprivate sector. WirelessBelgi\u00eb is an expert-led collective, consisting of a core group of \nenthusiastic radio amateurs and engineers providing free wireless access in cities \nthrough its own centralized network of powerful high-tech antennae and \ntransmitters. It also negotiates access to high-rise buildings, with property owners, \nwhich are described as  sponsors and which receive sponsorship in the form of \nhardware.  \n \nFinally, there are cases of private companies active within the community wireless \naccess movement. In the UK in particular, this type of privately owned community \nwireless project is quite common in rural communities. South Witham Broadband \nLtd describes itself as a local social enterprise serving the local community. The \ncompany was founded in 2004 and provides wireless and broadband internet access \nto the South Witham area, which is between Leicester and Peterborough.  \n \nThe gift economy in relation to sharing access implicates reciprocity in various ways. \nThe most apparent expectation of reciprocity is observed in commercial spaces, but \nalso the motivations of local authorities for investment in free Wi-Fi access spots are \noften economic rather than altruistic. Some forms of community WI-FI are altruistic \nin nature, and aimed at sharing access with no expectation of reciprocity. In the case \nof individual sharers this is often unintentional. The service offers of radical and \ncommunity projects are altruistic, but this generosity is often difficult to sustain. The \nlack of reciprocity means users often do not identify themselves with a community \nproject, which is obliged to compete for frequencies and users, with more powerful \ncommercial and municipal networks (Sandvin 2004; Carpentier 2008). Note that \nalthough many community Wi-Fi initiatives were born out of frustration at the lack of \ncommercial or public alternatives (Forlano 2008), this frustration has also been used \nby some social entrepreneurs to appropriate the discourse of community WI-FI and \nprovide subscription services to underserved local communities.  \n \nIt must be remembered that frequencies \u2013 crucial to Wi-Fi technology \u2013 are assets, \npotentially subject to leasing through a licensing regime controlled by the state. It \nremains to be seen to what extent unlicensed community Wi-Fi networks will be \nallowed to operate in the future. Likewise, leaving one\u2019s broadband connection \nunsecured enabling neighbors to access the internet, also a form of sharing access, \nmight have serious consequences in the near future. In the UK, one of the main \n  12 \nobjectives of the Digital Economy Act (BIS\/DCMS 2010) is to safeguard the rights of \ncopyright holders, which facilitates repression of the participatory sharing culture \nand might have the negative effect of closing down community Wi-Fi initiatives, and \nscare individuals who share their broadband access with others around them, into \nsecuring their connection to avoid being held liable for copyright protected content \ndownloaded by others using their connection or network. \n \n4. Conclusion \n \nIn the three modes of sharing considered above, various ways of giving, receiving, \nsharing and taking can be observed. Also, sharing in digital environments does not \nrule out reciprocity, and altruism is by no means the only motive for sharing. Finally, \nall forms of sharing attract the imposition of various co-option and appropriation \nstrategies, by capitalist agendas (cf. Table 2). \n \nTable 2: Overview of the three case studies \n \nWhat is \nShared? \nDisruption? Reciprocity? Co-option strategies? \n(1) Code  Propriety \nsoftware \nindustry \n\u2022 Intellectual \nproperty \n\u2022 Legal framework \n\u2022 Social capital and \nreputation \n\u2022 Career \nopportunities \n\u2022 Open Source vs. \nPublic Licenses  \n\u2022 Embedding of \npropriety code \n\u2022 Indirect auxiliary \nmodels \n\u2022 Remuneration \n(2) Digital \nContent: \nPublishing and \nentertainment \nindustry \n\u2022 Enforced \nreciprocity \n\u2022 Online \nadvertising \n\u2022 Kudos for \nbloggers \n\u2022 Legal downloading \n\u2022 Premium services of \nfilesharing sites \n\u2022 Artists\/labels \nappropriating web \n2.0 \n(3) Access ISPs and the \nTelecom \nindustry \n\u2022 Buying \nsomething \n\u2022 Promoting a city \n\u2022 Advertising and \nsponsorship \n\u2022 Commercial and \nMunicipal Public \nAccess WI-FI \n\u2022 Bandwidth \n\u2022 Appropriation of \nCommunity WI-FI \n \nIn terms of sharing code, the gift is always conditional, depending on the type of \nlicense. The GPL retains intellectual property, but subverts copyright law to keep the \ngift in the public domain, while some open source licenses enable the gift to be \npassed on to someone who ultimately will use it to generate added value. Sharing \ncode invokes some reciprocity in terms of reputation, social and symbolic capital or \nthe careers of coders.  \n \nSharing digital content can be examined at two levels both involving distinct \ndynamics. First, peer-to-peer sharing between anonymous users operating through \nthe strength of weak ties, can be seen as a form of embedded or enforced reciprocity; \nif you take, you automatically give as well. Second, another level of sharing digital \ncontent takes place through blogs and commercial filesharing sites. Here reciprocity \nemerges in the form of premium services to download more, and more quickly, or in \nthe form of intrusive advertising. At the same time, bloggers often crave and receive \nkudos or positive feedback from other bloggers and\/or anonymous downloaders.  \n \n  13 \nSharing access to the internet through Wi-Fi networks in caf\u00e9s or bookstores is a gift \nwith a clear expectation of reciprocity. Likewise, the motives of municipalities in \nproviding Wi-Fi access are seldom expressed in terms of public goods. Many \ncommunity Wi-Fi projects and individuals share their access altruistically, but here \ntoo a gradual co-option by commercial interests can be observed. To some extent this \nis inevitable since ultimately the costs of bandwidth and of infrastructure updates to \nprovide the citizen or consumer with \u2018free\u2019 Wi-Fi access, has to be paid for by \nsomeone. This and the lack of identification of users with community projects \nseriously affects the sustainability of community Wi-Fi initiatives.  \n \nIt is paradoxical that a fragmented individualism produced through the ideology of \nneoliberalism in combination with an anarchistic collectivism, drives the most \ndisruptive forms of sharing \u2013 decentralized software development, anonymous \nfilesharing and individual as well as radical Wi-Fi networks. Through these disruptive \npractices, altruism as well as reciprocity often become embroiled with individualism \nor even egoistic motives. What this points to is the complex relationship between the \ncapitalist commodity exchange regime and its disruptions, between sharing, giving \nand exchanging. The rejection of the commodity exchange model by sharing practices \nin the digital context, however, is not necessarily ideological or negating \nneoliberalism since it often does not have a finite purpose, i.e. the destruction of \ncapitalism. Code might be shared to further one\u2019s career as a programmer, a track \nmight be downloaded because it is easy and cheap to do so, and access might be \nshared because of the lack of knowledge about how to secure a Wi-Fi network.  \n \nThe above analysis shows that, over time, these disruptive sharing practices become \n(partially) enmeshed with capitalist logics aimed at creating added value through the \ndisruption. As a result, some forms of sharing cease to be disruptive; in other cases \nthe practices of rejection themselves become sources of commercial exploitations by \nindirectly providing revenue. So, a traditional form of capitalism clings on to the \nhegemony of the copyright\/property regime, but more radical capitalist strategies \nappropriate the sharing culture in different ways. In some cases, this is not \nnecessarily bad. The massive support of the FLOSS movement by (some) corporate \ninterests has contributed greatly to its success. Commercial filesharing sites enable \nbloggers and aggregators to share large files with multiple others and to stream live \ntelevision. South Witham Broadband Ltd in the UK, through a form of social \nentrepreneurship, provides better quality access and a dedicated service to remote \nlocal communities where the larger operators have not invested enough and service is \npoor.  \n \nWhile the sharing practices discussed here might not all aim to disrupt capitalism, \npervert the property regime or reject the primacy of the market, to varying degrees \nthese are often the end results. Certainly, in terms of the sharing of digital content the \ndisruption is considerable, based on the scale at which it takes place and the wide \ndiversity of the content that is made freely available. This leaves some important \nchoices. The cultural exchange model and the participatory culture in which it is \nsituated induces important societal benefits \u2013 externalities \u2013 which are difficult to \nmeasure in economic or quantitative terms, but are very real at the everyday level, for \nmany citizens, in terms of the software they use, the culture they can enjoy and\/or \ntheir access to the internet. Despite these gains, governments and parts of the \nentertainment industry are gearing up to confront this participatory culture head on \nby attempting to legally coerce it firmly back into the commodity exchange model.  \n \nHowever, in line with Adorno\u2019s words, quoted at the start of this piece, the history of \ndigital resistance is such that new ways undoubtedly will be developed to counter \nefforts to close down participatory cultures based on cultural exchange models and to \n  14 \nescape the material exchange value. But as the above analysis shows, other forms of \nreciprocity apply in most digital participatory practices based on sharing and, \nfurthermore, digital sharing practices do not inherently constitute an intentional act \nof resistance against neoliberalism\u2019s core-premises, they are to some extent a product \nof it.  \n \nReferences:  \n \nAdorno, Theodor W. 2002 [1938].
