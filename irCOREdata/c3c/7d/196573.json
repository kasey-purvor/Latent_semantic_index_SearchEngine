There are two \nversions of this route. In one, molten alloy is poured directly into a mould and through careful temperature \ncontrol during cooling a spheroidal semisolid microstructure is achieved, before the material in the mould is \nupended into a shot sleeve and hence forced into a die. Alternatively, the molten alloy is poured onto a \ncooling slope and thence into a mould before processing. The aim of the work described in this paper, and its \ncompanion, was to develop understanding of the microstructural development during the initial stages of this \nprocess i.e. in the mould before processing and with the cooling slope\/mould combination. In the previous \npaper, an analogue system based on aqueous ammonium chloride has been used to visualise what happens \nwhen an alloy is poured into a tilted mould with a chill wall, which acts to mimic the mould and the cooling \nslope in the NRC process. In this companion paper, the results for pouring A356 aluminium alloy directly \ninto a mould, and also via a cooling slope into a mould, are presented.  \n \n \nKeywords \nCooling slope; thixoforming; semisolid processing; thixotropic; A356; New Rheocasting. \n \n1. Introduction \n \nIn the companion paper [1], a detailed background is given. Here this will be briefly summarised. \n \nThixotropy was first discovered in semisolid metallic systems in the early 1970s [2]. If the microstructure in \nthe semisolid state consists of spheroids of solid in a liquid matrix, rather than dendrites, the material will \nflow when sheared but thicken if it is allowed to stand. Such a microstructure is termed \u2018thixoformable\u2019. \nReviews are given in [3-7]. Manufacturing routes based on this behaviour are termed semi-solid processing. \nOne particular route, which is industrially exploited, is the New Rheocasting (NRC) process patented by \nUBE [8,9]. This is summarised in Fig. 1 in [1]. In one version of the route molten alloy is poured via a \ncooling slope (see Ref. [1] Fig.1 step [1]-a) into a tilted steel mould (which moves to the vertical during the \nprocess) and in the other the pouring is direct (see Ref. [1] Fig.1 step [1]-b). In subsequent steps, the \nsemisolid is cooled slowly (see Fig. 1 in this paper) allowing the development of a fine, uniform spheroidal \nmicrostructure. It is then delivered, whilst still in the semisolid state, into the shot sleeve. Advantages include \nthe fact that there is no need for specially treated thixoformable feedstock and scrap can be readily recycled \nwithin the plant [10]. The main disadvantage is that the mould size and mould induction heating conditions \nare necessarily very precisely related to the metered volume of alloy. Thus, the process is highly suitable for \nvolume production but less suitable for producing components of varying sizes where, each time the size \nchanged, a different mould would be required.  \n \nPrevious workers have shown [11] that it is important to hold the melt close to the liquidus temperature and \nto quench it quickly to form many nuclei. These are distributed throughout the cup (the mould in Fig. 1 in \nRef. [1]) and grow in a globular fashion when two criteria are both fulfilled - the nuclei must be small and the \ntemperature gradient in the cup shallow. Dendritic growth then does not develop and the behaviour is very \nsimilar to that in liquidus casting [12]. Uggowitzer and Kaufmann [13] argued that the nuclei are formed by \npartial quenching of the melt. This was backed up by simulation results from Zhu et al. [14]. One central \naspect of the NRC process [11] is the laminar filling of the crucible, which is achieved by controlled pouring \nof the melt along the wall of the inclined crucible (see Ref. [1] Fig. 1 [1] \u2013 b). The microstructure is distinctly \nmore dendritic after turbulent filling i.e. uncontrolled direct pouring into the centre of the cup. \n \nFor the cooling slope, Mitsuru et al. [15] have proposed that particle multiplication occurs as the dendrites \nthat are growing on the surface are fractured by the shear stress produced by the fluid flowing down the \nslope. A change in tilt angle would change the fluid flow rate and alter the extent of this phenomenon. Lee et \nal [16] found that increased flow velocity increased the deflection of dendrites growing on a tilted chill plate. \nThis fluid flow resulted in plastic deformation or partial melting of the growing dendrites and their \ndetachment from the cooling slope, with the crystals being carried into the mould. \n \nThe use of a cooling slope to generate non-dendritic semisolid microstructures is gaining increasing attention \nfor a range of processing routes other than the NRC process. Haga et al. [17] showed that the solid fraction \nentering the mould from the slope increased with the length of contact of the melt with the cooling slope. \nHaga [18] has linked the cooling slope to feed twin roll casters and other workers have fed the material to \nstrip rollers [19]. A number of workers have characterised material produced with a cooling slope [20-22], or \nhave used such material to produce semi-solid processed components for mechanical characterisation [23]. \nRecently there has been interest in applying the cooling slope to high temperature alloys such as steels, where \nprotective gaseous atmospheres should be applied to minimise oxidation [24,25]. In addition, vibration has \nbeen applied to a cooling slope, albeit one where a transparent analogue is being employed [26]. The \nprincipal objective of vibration is to increase the number of nuclei available by fragmentation or by \nstimulation of free nucleation in the liquid. Note that in this work described in this paper, the flow down the \nslope is videoed and the material left on the slope examined after pouring (the \u2018remnant material\u2019). These \nobservations have not been reported in any previous work. In addition, none of the previous workers have \ndescribed a bottom-stoppered arrangement for pouring onto the slope. \n \nIn the companion paper [1], work with a transparent analogue is described, illustrating graphically the \nprocesses as a near-liquidus melt enters a mould with the lower wall chilled. In the transparent analogue, the \ncrystals are significantly more dense than the liquid and tend to settle through the liquid and also roll down \nthe chilled wall. Increasing tilt angle tends to increase the speed at which particles roll down the wall and \ntherefore enhances the possibility of equiaxed formation rather than columnar dendritic growth. There will be \nan optimum angle for enhancing equiaxed formation beyond which the chill wall is not playing as significant \na role in nucleation. \n \nIn this paper, A356 aluminium alloy has been used and the following characterised systematically: effect of \nmould type, superheat, use of a heated mould, pouring temperature, cooling slope length, cooling slope tilt \nangle and slope temperature. The influence of vibration and of rotating the mould have also been examined. \nIt was thought that rotation of the mould might enhance spheroidal development.  \n \n2. Experimental method  \n \n2.1 Cooling Slope Apparatus \n \nInitially, top pouring from an alumina crucible was used but the flow onto the slope was very uncontrollable. \nA second arrangement involved pouring the treated melt via a small tundish, but here close temperature \ncontrol was difficult. In the final setup, as shown in Fig. 2 a), for optimum control of the flow and \ntemperature during casting, a bottom-stoppered alumina crucible with a graphite nozzle was used. The details \nare shown in Figs. 2 b) and c). During melting, the nozzle was stoppered with a ceramic (mullite or alumina) \nrod, within which a K-type thermocouple was located to monitor the temperature during the melting and \nteeming process. Flow down the slope was videoed with a high speed JVC digital camera. Thermocouples \n(K-type) were used to monitor the temperature at the beginning and the end of the cooling slope, making sure \nthat the flowing metal was in contact with them. Three different casting distances (\u2018cooling lengths\u2019) were \nevaluated (250, 200 and 150 mm) in conjunction with a stainless steel mould. The mould at the bottom of the \nslope (dimensions given in Table 1) had sides with a draft angle of 3\u02da  to help removal of the ingot following \nsolidification. The mould was vertical and the base of the slope above it was such that semimolten metal \nflowed into the middle of the cup. Here, the role of the cooling slope is focussed on, rather than the tilt of the \nmould. To avoid sticking of the metal to the cooling slope (which was made of mild steel) and the mould, \nboron nitride was sprayed on their surfaces.  \n \nMelting was carried out with a Banyard medium frequency induction furnace (50 kW maximum power and \nfrequency up to 9600 Hz). A charge of approximately 1 kg of aluminium alloy was melted at 700\u02daC and held \nfor 5 minutes for temperature homogenisation. Then a hexachloroethane tablet was added to reduce the \nhydrogen content before pouring down the cooling slope. Casting temperatures were varied between 620\u02daC \nand 680\u02daC.  \n \nFor most experiments, the cooling slope had cold water circulating through it. The effect of altering the \ntemperature of the cooling slope was examined. The conditions were: a) slope preheated to 400\u02daC, b) slope at \nroom temperature (20\u02da C) but with no cold water circulating through it and c) slope chilled with cold water \ncirculating. The effect of altering the temperature of the mould was also examined. For the \u2018cold\u2019 mould, the \nmould was at room temperature. The casting procedure was to pour the molten metal down the slope and let \nit run into the mould. The mould and contents were then quenched directly. In the hot mould experiments, the \nmould was previously heated to the desired temperature (in this case 400\u02daC) in an electric resistance furnace \nand then transferred to another vertical cylindrical resistance furnace pre-set at 580\u02daC to allow isothermal \nholding in the semi-solid condition (see Fig. 3, which also shows the vibratory device which is described in \nSection 2.2). The furnace and the mould within it were located at the end of the cooling slope. The aluminium \nalloy was poured into the mould via the cooling slope and then the mould quenched after the required holding \ntime.   \n \nFor comparison with cooling slope results, some ingots were cast directly into the mould without the cooling \nslope. The temperature of the mould was room temperature and the pouring temperatures were 620\u02daC, 630\u02daC \nand 650\u02daC. In contrast with the cooling slope experiments, the crucible was top poured into the mould (this \nwas to avoid disassembling the cooling slope apparatus). For comparison purposes, the mould materials were \nvaried (see Table 1). The wall thicknesses also varied and, in the case of the insulator mould, the dimensions \nwere also different (50 mm internal diameter x 50 mm height cf. 40 mm internal diameter x 70 mm height for \nthe other mould materials). The mould was insulated with MgO bricks on the top and on the bottom to favour \nradial heat extraction. A K-type thermocouple was located centrally at the mid-height of the mould cavity and \nits output recorded with rapid data acquisition software. The stainless steel mould was found to give the best \nresults and was therefore used for all subsequent experiments. \n \n2.2 Vibration of the Slope and Rotation of the Mould \n \nTwo modifications were incorporated with the objective of aiding nucleation. Firstly a sieve shaker with 60 \nHz frequency was attached to the slope to apply horizontal vibration while the metal was being cast down it. \nThe second was to rotate the mould at 200 rpm. Fig. 3 shows the experimental set up for the vibration device. \n \n2.3 Materials and Metallography \n \nThe A356 alloy was supplied by Alcan (6.82Si, 0.32Mg, 0.22Cu, 0.005Zn, 0.112Fe, <0.005Mn, 0.10Ti, \n0.013Pb, 0.042Sn, 0.006Ni, 0.005Cr, balance Al). The liquidus is at 615\u02daC and the solidus at 577\u02daC [27]. \n \nThe small ingot samples from the cooling slope and direct casting experiments were sectioned vertically. The \nlocations of images are then described as \u2018edge\u2019, \u2018mid-radius\u2019 and \u2018centre\u2019. For metallography, all specimens \nwere mounted in bakelite, polished using 240 and 600 grinding papers, and then polished with 6 micron and 3 \nmicron diamond pastes followed by \u00bc micron \u2018Silco\u2019 liquid. Electrolytic anodising was carried out with the \nsample as the anode and a stainless steel wire as the cathode. Barker\u2019s reagent (5 ml HBF4 (48%), 95 ml H20) \nwas used as the electrolyte. The voltage was set at 20 V and the samples were held for 1.5-2 minutes.  \n \nIn addition to the ingot microstructures, top, middle and end-of-slope microstructures were obtained from \nremnant metal solidified on the cooling slope. \n \nImage analysis was carried out on microstructures using Sigma Scan Pro 5 (a commercial software package) \nto determine the area and perimeter of \u03b1-Al particles. Note that this is cell size rather than grain size i.e. each \nglobule is treated as a separate entity. The shape factor was defined as (perimeter)2\/4\u03c0(area). For optimum \nsemi-solid processing characteristics, the shape factor should be as close to 1 as possible. The error on shape \nfactor measurements is about + 0.1. Particle sizes were measured by the linear intercept method according to \nthe ASTM E112-96 standard. The error on particle size measurements is about +3\u03bcm unless stated to be \notherwise. Volume fraction solid was predicted using the Scheil equation assuming binary composition Al-Si \nalloy. \n \n3. Experimental Results \n \n3.1 The Basic Effect of the Cooling Slope \n Fig. 4 shows the characteristic dendritic growth which results from conventional casting into a metal mould \nwith no cooling slope. The superheat was high enough to ensure that the number of crystals nucleated was \ninsufficient to produce fine spheroidal primary crystals; instead coarse non-spheroidal crystals were formed. \nWhen the molten alloy was cast via the cooling slope into a metal mould at room temperature, small compact \nprimary \u03b1-Al crystals were formed, the resulting microstructure showing dendritic character towards the \nedge, rosettes at mid-radius and rosettes and spheroids in the centre (Fig. 5). \n \n3.2 Mould Type \n \nFig. 6 shows that mild steel and copper gave the highest cooling rate, whilst stainless steel gave an \nintermediate rate and the insulating mould the lowest rate. It should be noted though that, above the solidus \ntemperature of 577\u02da C, the cooling rates for all except the insulating mould are very similar. Fig. 7 shows the \nmicrostructure obtained in four different cold moulds. A high thermal conductivity mould gives a small \nprimary particle size in the centre (~65 \u03bcm for the copper mould). The primary crystals in the centre of the \ninsulating mould are much larger (~135 \u03bcm).  \n \n3.3 Effect of Superheat on Ingot Microstructure \n \nFig. 8 shows the effect of superheat on particle size and shape factor. The particle size in the centre of the \ningot was fairly constant, with change in pouring temperature, at between 70 and 75 \u03bcm. However, the shape \nfactor in the centre of the ingot varies between 1.4 for a pouring temperature of 620\u02daC (i.e. strongly \nspheroidal) and 2.6 for 680\u02daC (i.e. predominantly dendritic). At the surface of the ingot, low superheat gave a \nmuch finer microstructure in comparison with higher pouring temperature (33 \u03bcm versus 75 \u03bcm). The shape \nfactor is always high (between 3.8 and 4.3) at the surface of the ingot and the structure is basically dendritic.  \n 3.4 Microstructure with a Heated Mould \n \nResults from pouring into a cold mould compared with those from pouring into a stainless steel mould at \n300\u02daC and one at 400\u02daC show that, with increased mould temperature, the microstructure becomes coarser \nbut not spheroidal. However, if the mould and contents are maintained in a furnace at a semisolid \ntemperature, even for a short time, the microstructure becomes spheroidal and homogeneous. Fig. 9 shows a \nmicrostructure which is representative of the structure right across the ingot. The average spheroid size is \nabout 120 \u03bcm with a shape factor of 1.4. Fig. 10 (a) shows that teeming into a cold stainless steel mould via \n250 mm of cooling slope develops a rosette-like morphology with a particle size of ~70 \u03bcm and a shape \nfactor of ~1.7. Fig. 10 (b) shows that teeming, via 250 mm of cooling slope, into a stainless steel mould \npreheated to 400\u02daC and then held at 580\u02daC for only 60 s (as opposed to 10 min. in Fig. 9) gives \u03b1-Al particles \n90 \u03bcm in size with a shape factor of ~1.5. This morphology is appropriate for the SSM process. It is \nimportant to control the hold time at 580\u02daC to avoid excessive coarsening of the \u03b1 particles. \n \n3.5 Effect of Cooling Slope Length \n \nThe effect of cooling slope length is shown in Fig. 11. The contact time of the melt with the cooling slope \nincreases as the contact length increases. However, there is little systematic difference in the morphology and \nsize of the particles once the material has arrived in the mould and been quenched. The particles in the centre \nhave strong spheroidal morphology with a particle size of between 62 and 75 \u03bcm and a shape factor of \nbetween 1.2 and 1.4. Some indication of the reason for the lack of an effect of cooling slope length is shown \nin Fig. 12. Although these images are for a slope at 45\u02da  tilt angle rather than 60\u02da (as in Fig. 1 1), the behaviour \nshown is characteristic. When the molten metal first touches the slope it forms an elliptical \u2018impact zone\u2019, \nwhere the material is spread. A short distance further down the slope, the alloy has regathered into a \u2018snake\u2019 \nand then progresses as a snake down the rest of the slope.  The impact zone reaches its maximum area of \nextent (about 25 cm2) in the first second after teeming and then decreases rapidly after the first second to \nabout 12 cm2.  \n \n3.6 Microstructure of the Remnant Material on the Cooling Slope, Including the Effect of Tilt Angle \n \nThe remnant material has not been quenched as such but it is in contact with the cooling slope with water \ncirculating through it and the whole pouring process only takes a few seconds. Fig. 13 shows the \nmicrostructure of the remnant material for a cooling slope length of 250 mm. Fig. 14 shows the effect of tilt \nangle and superheat on particle size and shape factor for a 250 mm slope length. The measurements were \ntaken on microstructures from the bottom of the slope. The results for 60\u02da and 45\u02da are almost identical, with a \nslightly lower shape factor for 630\u02daC pouring than 620\u02daC. With a tilt angle of 30\u02da, the shape factor is \ndistinctly higher, with both pouring temperatures, than for the higher tilt angles. The grain size is slightly \nhigher (80 \u03bcm as opposed to nearer 65 \u03bcm) for the low tilt angle than the higher ones at a 630\u02daC pouring \ntemperature. At the 620\u02daC pouring temperature, the grain size is almost identical for all tilt angles. \n \n3.7 Fraction Solid at the End of the Slope \n \nTable 2 shows the loss of temperature during 250 mm travel down the slope. The time to travel down the \nslope was obtained from videos. The resulting cooling rate is given, along with the fraction solid at the end of \nthe slope based on prediction from the Scheil equation. The fraction solid at the end of the slope was in the \nrange 0.48-0.54 for a pouring temperature of 620\u02daC and 0.32-0.33 for 630\u02daC. \n \n3.8 Effect of Slope Temperature \n \nWith the slope preheated to 400\u02da C, a relatively coarse structure was obtained in the ingot with a particle size \nat the centre of the ingot of 108+32 \u03bcm and a shape factor of 1.3. If the slope was at room temperature (25\u02daC) \nthe particle size and shape factor are almost identical to those with the chilled cooling slope (15\u02daC)  viz \napproximately 85+25 \u03bcm and 1.2. The pouring temperature for these experiments was 630\u02daC with a cooling \nslope length of 250 mm. \n \n3.9 Vibration of the Cooling Slope and Rotation of the Mould \n \nComparing ingots produced with the vibration device and those without (pouring at 650\u02daC with a cooling \nslope tilt angle of 45\u02da  and a slope length of 250 mm), with a hold temperature in t he ingot of 580\u02da C, shows \nthe morphology to be very similar. There is, however, a measurable effect on the particle size (Fig. 15). \n \nThe microstructure obtained by teeming into a rotating mould is shown in Fig. 16 in comparison with that for \na static mould. No cooling slope has been used. The ingot microstructure obtained with a static mould had a \nstrong dendritic character (Fig. 16 (a) and (c)). Close to the wall, a columnar dendritic morphology with \ndendrite arm spacing (DAS) of ~16 \u03bcm was observed. With the rotating mould, the microstructure at the wall \nis coarser (with a DAS of ~34 \u03bcm) (Fig. 16 (b) and (d)). Table 3 shows that if a cooling slope is used with the \nrotating mould the microstructure is finer and the shape factor smaller.   \n \n \n4. Discussion \n \nThe results for the effects of the thermal properties of the mould, the melt superheat, the effect of heating the \nmould and the casting without a cooling slope are consistent with those of previous workers [13,29,30]. \n \nThe existence of an \u2018impact zone\u2019 has not previously been identified in the literature. The impact zone on the \nslope is thought to be the principal source of nuclei in the cooling slope experiments. There is evidence to \nsupport this from the ingots (Fig. 11) and from the remnant material (Fig. 13). In Fig. 11, the length on the \ncooling slope has a relatively small effect on the particle size and shape factor in the centre of the ingot. The \nmicrostructures in Fig. 13 support the hypothesis that the majority of the nucleation is taking place in the top \npart of the slope. If nucleation were occurring significantly as the material progresses down the slope after the \nimpact zone the microstructure in Fig. 13 (b) would be much finer than it is and a wider range of globule \nsizes would be expected (as some nuclei would have had longer to coarsen than others). Comparing Fig. 13 \n(a) with Fig. 13 (b), some coarsening is occurring. The relatively small effect of tilt angle with low superheat \n(620\u02daC) shown in Figs. 14 and 15 is consistent with this hypothesis. As the superheat is increased, tilt angle \ndoes start to have an effect, initially on shape factor, a low tilt angle (30\u02da) giving a higher shape factor. Only \nthe results for relatively low superheats are presented here and other workers have investigated higher values, \nconcluding that either 45\u02da  [20, referring back to an older reference although this does not appear to deal with \nthe angles indicated or the same material] or 60\u02da [1 7] is optimum. With higher tilt angle, the fluid flow rate \nwill tend to be high, with the nuclei tumbling in the fluid flow, precluding the formation of extensive \ndendrites and enhancing rosette\/spheroidal morphology. \n \nIt was expected that an increase in nucleation would be obtained, and as a consequence smaller particle sizes, \nwith longer cooling slope distances. This is not what was found in this work but these results are in \ncontradiction with results from other authors. Haga [17] and Haga and co-authors [28,29] show results where \nthe length of contact with the cooling slope does affect the ingot microstructure, although the effect was not \nquantified. Haga and co-authors used a cooling slope and cooling lengths very similar to that in the current \nwork, including the use of the boron nitride coating for lubrication. It should be noted, though, that the \nthickness of the boron nitride was not measured or standardised in the current work and there is evidence in \nthe literature that the thickness has an influence [30]. The role of the impact zone merits further investigation \nand experiments are currently underway on this. \n \nConventionally, the slope has been seen as a copious source of nuclei but it clearly plays a role in the \nspheroidisation process as well. Fig. 13 shows that, on reaching the bottom of the cooling slope, some \nspheroidisation has occurred.  The evidence from the remnant material suggests that there is little particle \nmultiplication during travel down the slope (Fig. 13).  \n \nHuang et al. [26], in their work with a transparent analogue, have argued that vibration breaks down the \nsolidification shell formed on the surface of the slope through rapid chilling and hence can produce finer \nglobular grains in the resulting structure. The frequency and amplitude of vibration of the slope influence the \noutcome. Southin [31] suggests that, in comparison with a static surface, vibration enhances the showering of \ndendrites from the slope surface. Flemings [32] argues that success in achieving grain refinement through \nvibration is due to grain multiplication (by dendrite fracture or remelting) and not due to enhanced \nhomogeneous nucleation. Here vibration has had a measurable effect on size (Fig. 15) but not shape. This \nsuggests more nuclei are being produced but are then being subjected to similar shape governing processes.   \n \nThe rotation of the mould is probably leading to detachment of the chilling solid as it forms at the wall. The \nrotation inhibits heat transfer (hence giving a coarser structure) but discourages the formation of the columnar \ndendritic zone (Fig. 16). The combination of a cooling slope with a rotating mould gives a structure which \nwould be very suitable for semi-solid processing with a size of 70 \u03bcm and shape factor of 1.4 (Table 3). \nHowever, without the rotation a size of 75 \u03bcm and a shape factor of 1.5 can be achieved. Rotation may not, \ntherefore, be economically viable. It does however give greater homogeneity through the structure than \nwithout (Fig. 16). Comparing Fig. 16 (a) and Fig. 16 (c), pouring direct into a static cold stainless steel mould \nwithout a cooling slope, a pour temperature of 650\u02daC gives, if anything, a slightly finer microstructure  than \nthe 630\u02daC pour.  \n \nIn the companion paper [1] for the transparent analogue, low superheat is shown to enhance the formation of \nfine, relatively spheroidal particles. The results in this paper are consistent with that. In [1], it is shown that \nthe tilted chill wall is effective in promoting the formation of fine crystals (in comparison with a vertical \narrangement). Again here, if the cooling slope is removed the microstructure tends to be coarser and more \ndendritic. In [1], increasing the tilt angle from 45\u02da to 60\u02da tended to enhance the possibility of equiaxed \nformation rather than columnar dendritic growth. Here the findings are more equivocal, with tilt angle \nshowing relatively little effect, at least for low superheats. This is thought to be associated with the fact that, \nfor the metallic system, the \u2018impact zone\u2019 is dominating the behaviour. The fact that the transparent analogue \nsystem consists of a cell rather than a slope means that this effect could not be observed in [1]. \n  \nConcluding Remarks \nThe key findings from the above results are as follows: \n1) A high thermal conductivity mould gives a fine primary particle size in the centre of the ingot (65 \u03bcm \nwith a copper mould) but an inhomogeneous microstructure across the ingot. \n2) Low superheat, with a cooling slope, gives fine, relatively spheroidal particles (70 \u03bcm and shape \nfactor 1.4 for 5\u02daC superheat, 60\u02da tilt, 200 mm cooling slope length) but again an inhomogeneous ingot \nstructure. \n3) A heated mould gives a relatively coarse but non-spheroidal microstructure but a short hold at 580\u02daC \nin the semisolid region spheroidises the structure (90 \u03bcm with a shape factor of 1.5 for a 400\u02daC \nmould); the microstructure is relatively homogenous across the ingot. \n4) Without a cooling slope, the microstructure tends to be coarser and more dendritic. \n5) The remnant material suggests there is little nucleation in the lower reaches of the slope but that some \ncoarsening does occur as the material travels down. \n6) Tilt angle has relatively little effect, at least for low superheats. \n7) The slope could be used in the room temperature condition and get very similar results to those with \nthe chill operating; a heated slope gives relatively coarse microstructures. \n8) Vibration is effective is giving a finer particle size (by about 12 \u03bcm). \n9) A rotating mould gives a coarser structure but one which is less dendritic, particularly near the wall. \nThe results for the thermal conductivity of the mould, the melt superheat, the effect of heating the mould and \nthe casting without a cooling slope are consistent with those of previous workers. There is some \ninconsistency in the results on tilt angle in comparison with those of other workers. This might be associated \nwith issues in the quantification of microstructural features or the role of the impact zone at the top of the \nslope. It is hypothesised here that the elliptical impact zone may be the primary source of nuclei. These nuclei \nthen coarsen and spheroidise during travel down the slope. Conventionally, the cooling slope has been seen \nas primarily causing heterogeneous nucleation but the results here suggest microstructural development \noccurs on the slope as well.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nECL would like to acknowledge financial support provided by CONACyt and SEP and also the Universidad \nAut\u00f3noma del Estado de Hidalgo for support.
