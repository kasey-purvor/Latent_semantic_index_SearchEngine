Everybody wants to do it. \nThey just don't want to do what you have to do to make the trip. \n \nUS Senator Phil Grammi \n \n \nThe common pool resource problem can severely undermine prudent fiscal policy. The literature \nhighlights diverse aspects of this problem, including the role of budget institutions (Von Hagen, \n1992; Alesina et al., 1999) and partisan variables (Volkerink & De Haan, 2001; Perotti & \nKontopoulos, 2002). Perotti and Kontopoulos (2002, p. 192) contribute an analytically valuable \ndistinction between \u2018size fragmentation\u2019 (the number of decision makers) and \u2018procedural \nfragmentation\u2019 (the structure of the process in which they interact). Surprisingly, however, their \nempirical work does not consider the interaction between these two types of fragmentation, \nalthough the theoretical case for doing so is very strong. Several other papers consider different \nfacets of the fragmentation hypothesis, but similarly fail to account for this possibility, including \nVolkerink and De Haan (2001), Woo (2003), Fabrizio and Mody (2006), and Elgie and \nMcMenamin (2008). As a result, we still know very little about whether budgetary procedures \ncan mitigate the adverse fiscal effects of multiple fiscal decision makers. \n \nIn this paper, I argue that the fiscal impact of size fragmentation should be conditional on \nprocedural fragmentation, and empirically investigate this hypothesis. The conceptual discussion \nexplains how the interaction of these different types of fragmentation should produce distinct \nfiscal outcomes. I offer an empirical test based on a panel dataset comprising 57 countries over \n 4 \nthe 1975 to 1998 period. Other studies of the common pool resource problem in budgeting have \ntended to focus on much smaller samples of countries in Western Europe or Latin America, or \nmembers of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Therefore, \nthe analysis in this paper contributes both a unified conceptual approach as well as a broadly \nbased empirical test to the literature. The paper has three main parts: a discussion of the different \ntypes of fragmentation; an overview of the variables, data, and some methodological issues; \nfollowed by the empirical model and the results. The conclusion points out policy implications \nand possibilities for further research. \n \n \n1. Types of fragmentation \n \nTheoretical work on the common pool resource problem in budgeting highlights that a \nproliferation of fiscal decision makers gives rise to fiscal indiscipline (Weingast et al., 1981; Von \nHagen & Harden, 1995; Velasco, 2000). However, institutional arrangements can mitigate fiscal \nillusion by vesting strategic power in actors who are likely to internalize costs, such as the \nfinance minister or prime minister (Von Hagen & Harden, 1995). This suggests that the fiscal \nimpact of fragmented decision making depends on two types of fragmentation (Perotti & \nKontopoulos, 2002, p. 192): the number of decision makers, or \u2018size fragmentation\u2019, and the \nstructure of the process in which they interact, or \u2018procedural fragmentation\u2019. Depending on the \nrelevant decision making unit, size fragmentation can refer to the number of individual policy \nmakers or political parties. Procedural fragmentation refers to the degree to which the design of \n 5 \nthe budget process allows the finance minister to protect the revenue pool from special interest \nclaims. \n \nEarly cross-national studies tended to focus on one of these types of fragmentation. For instance, \nVon Hagen and Harden (1995) present results for 12 European Union countries that show an \nassociation between budget institutions and deficit and debt during the 1980s (see also Von \nHagen, 1992). Alesina, Hausmann, Hommes, and Stein (1999) apply a similar approach to 20 \nLatin American and Caribbean countries. They find an association between budget institutions \nand primary deficits in the 1980s and early 1990s (see also Stein et al., 1998). In contrast, \nVolkerink and De Haan\u2019s (2001) study of deficits in 22 OECD countries over the 1971 to 1996 \nperiod includes several measures of size fragmentation in the legislature and the executive, with \nsome significant results. However, they ignore the structure of the budget process.ii \n \nOnly more recently have some authors begun to incorporate measures of both size and \nprocedural fragmentation into their analyses. Notably, Perotti and Kontopoulos (2002) consider \nthe association of the number of parties in a coalition and the number of spending ministers with \nseveral fiscal indicators in 19 OECD countries over the 1970 to 1995 period. They also include \nprocedural variables, namely the use of fiscal targets and the nature of negotiations between the \nfinance minister and spending ministers. However, they ignore the legislative arena and, \ncrucially, do not explore the possible interaction between their measures of size and procedural \nfragmentation. Woo (2003) runs a battery of regressions with a sample of 57 countries between \n1970 and 1990 to investigate the association of a range of economic, political, and institutional \nvariables with deficits. The interaction between size and procedural fragmentation is not \n 6 \nconsidered. Fabrizio and Mody (2006) study the determinants of primary balances in ten Eastern \nEuropean countries between 1997 and 2003, including a measure of government fragmentation \nas well as a detailed index of budget institutions borrowed from the work of Gleich (2003) and \nYl\u00e4outinen (2004). Despite explicitly setting out to investigate whether budget institutions \ncounteract political indiscipline, Fabrizio and Mody (2006) do not investigate the interaction \nbetween these variables. Some cross-national studies have considered how budget institutions \ninteract with other variables (Hallerberg & Marier, 2004; Alt & Lassen, 2006), but the \ninteraction between size and procedural fragmentation has yet to be explored. \n \n[FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE] \n \nFigure 1 offers a simplified representation of the likely interaction between the two concepts of \nfragmentation distinguished by Perotti and Kontopoulos (2002). The vertical axis measures size \nfragmentation, i.e. the number of budgetary decision makers. The horizontal axis measures \nprocedural fragmentation, i.e. the extent to which strategic power is centralized in the hands of \nan actor with incentives to internalize costs. Figure 1 helps to clarify under what conditions size \nfragmentation can be expected to lead to fiscal indiscipline. First, consider the possible outcomes \nwhen procedural fragmentation is low. Where both size fragmentation and procedural \nfragmentation are low, there is no threat at all to fiscal discipline. When size fragmentation is \nhigh but the design of the budget process centralizes decision making, adverse fiscal effects can \nbe contained. Now consider the two groups of possible outcomes with high procedural \nfragmentation. Where procedural fragmentation is high but size fragmentation is low, the budget \nprocess could potentially favor loose fiscal policy. However, the theory of common pool \n 7 \nresources suggests that the limited number of decision makers induces fiscal restraint, as they \ninternalize a large share of the costs. However, when many decision makers operate without \ninstitutional safeguards, the common pool resource problem leads to fiscal indiscipline. \n \nHence, contrary to what much of the empirical literature at least implicitly suggests, the \nargument put forward here is that neither size nor procedural fragmentation per se need to give \nrise to fiscal indiscipline. Rather, it should be the coincidence of both types of fragmentation that \nproduces this outcome. Put differently, the effects of size fragmentation and procedural \nfragmentation should not be additive, but multiplicative, since the impact of size fragmentation \non fiscal policy is conditional on the extent of procedural fragmentation in the budget process. \n \n \n2. Variables, data, and methods \n \nFor the empirical investigation, I use a panel of 57 countries over the 1975 to 1998 period. \nDictatorship and authoritarian rule are inimical to the representative function of political actors \nthat underpins the logic of the common pool resource problem. For instance, a military dictator \nmight suspend the legislature or replace its members with appointed cronies. Hence, I exclude \nyears of strongly impaired democracy or non-democracy as indicated by a Freedom House score \nlarger than 3.5.iii The dependent variable is the central government budget deficit. The economic \ncontrols include the natural logarithm of inflation and annual GDP growth (as in Hallerberg & \nMarier, 2004), as well as trade openness measured as the sum of exports and imports divided by \nGDP (see Alesina et al., 1999). Inflation can affect budgets in various ways, although the \n 8 \ndirection is hard to predict. For instance, an associated increase in interest rates may push up debt \nservicing costs, while bracket creep and delayed adjustment of non-indexed spending items help \nto improve the budget balance. Economic growth is likely to increase tax revenues and at the \nsame time reduce the demand for some types of social spending in particular, resulting in a \npositive impact on the budget balance. Trade openness can help to reduce deficits by generating \ntrade-related revenues such as import and export duties. Moreover, exposure to market forces \nmay compel governments to adopt a more prudent fiscal stance than under limited openness. \n \nIn addition, I add several political variables. Notably, to account for electoral budget cycles \n(Franzese, 2002; Brender & Drazen, 2005), I use a dummy to indicate years of legislative \nelections. I also speculate that left parties in government might be more profligate than \nadministrations from the centre or the right of the political spectrum (Volkerink & De Haan, \n2001) and control for a head of government from a left-of-centre party. Finally, I include a \ndummy set equal to one for the 12 original Eurozone members in each year starting with 1992, \nwhen the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty paved the way for monetary union. This process is \nassociated with improvements in the budget balance, although the sustainability of this effect is \ncontested (Milesi-Ferretti, 2003; Koen & Van den Noord, 2005). Refer to Appendix 1 for full \nvariable definitions and data sources, and Appendix 2 for summary statistics. \n \nMeasures of procedural fragmentation are hard to come by for this unusually large sample. \nExisting surveys of budget institutions cover a much smaller number of countries and shorter \ntime periods. To obtain a relevant measure of procedural fragmentation in the legislative budget \nprocess, I collected data on budgetary amendment rules for all countries in the dataset, using \n 9 \nconstitutions, legislative rules, as well as secondary sources (see Table 1). There are very good \nreasons for using this variable to indicate procedural fragmentation in the legislature. First, a \nminimum of two separate sources for the relevant provisions in each country ensures a high \ndegree of confidence in the accuracy of the data. Moreover, this is the only variable that \nconsistently features in every cross-national index of budget institutions to capture the role of the \nlegislature in fiscal policy decisions (Von Hagen, 1992; Alesina et al., 1999; Gleich, 2003; \nHallerberg & Marier, 2004; Yl\u00e4outinen, 2004; Fabrizio & Mody, 2006; Hallerberg et al., 2007 \nand forthcoming). Other indicators of procedural fragmentation in the legislature have been \nsuggested, such as reversionary budget provisions (Alesina et al., 1999), the structure of the \ncommittee system (Crain & Muris, 1995), bicameralism (Heller, 1997), and the sequencing of \nthe voting process in the legislature (Von Hagen, 1992). However, these are not uniformly used \nin empirical work, and the relevance of some of these features is contested.iv Hence, there is an \nexceptionally high degree of consensus in the literature that powers of amendment are central to \nunderstanding the role of the legislature in fiscal policy decisions. \n \nThe data in Table 1 yield different measures of procedural fragmentation in the legislature. First, \nI construct a dummy variable indicating whether legislative amendments are unfettered or \nlimited. If there is a limit on changes during the approval stage of the budget process, the \nexecutive has agenda setting powers and can contain legislative profligacy. I also construct two \ndummies to separate those restrictions that do not allow the legislature to increase expenditures \nfrom those that prohibit the approval of a higher deficit than in the draft budget. There is \nanecdotal evidence that deficit-based restrictions may be less effective. For instance, Brazilian \nlegislators have circumvented a constitutional prohibition to increase deficits through unrealistic \n 10 \nupward revisions of revenue estimates (Bl\u00f6ndal et al., 2003, p. 118). The distinction between \nthese two main types of amendment constraints provides an additional robustness check for the \nempirical analysis. \n \n[TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE] \n \nUnfortunately, there is no similarly comprehensive information on the strategic power of the \nminister of finance vis-\u00e0-vis her cabinet colleagues. Different surveys of budget institutions are \ndiverse in terms of countries, time periods, and measurement. Alesina, Hausmann, Hommes, and \nStein (1996, Appendix B) asked budget directors in Latin American and Caribbean countries: \n\u2018Does the minister of finance have more authority than the spending ministers regarding the \nbudget?\u2019 Although there is some overlap with the sample used here, there is insufficient \nvariation, as 18 out of 20 respondents indicated that these powers were \u2018considerabl[y] greater\u2026 \n(formally and in practice)\u2019. Moreover, as Hallerberg and Marier (2004, p. 578) point out, this \nmeasure reveals nothing about the way in which the power of finance ministers differs across \ncountries. Building on the work by Von Hagen (1992), Hallerberg, Strauch, and Von Hagen \n(2007 and forthcoming) document the evolution of several institutional features to assess the \nauthority of European Union finance ministers, for example the power to impose ceilings on the \nbids of spending ministers during the budget drafting process, and authority to block the \ndisbursement of funds during budget execution. However, overlap with the dataset used here is \nlimited to 15 countries and only a part of the sample period. There is relevant work on budget \ninstitutions in Central and Eastern European countries (Gleich, 2003; Yl\u00e4outinen, 2004; Fabrizio \n& Mody, 2006), but these recent democracies are not included in the dataset used here. Finally, \n 11 \nPerotti and Kontopoulos (2002, pp. 220-221) experiment with indicators of spending limits and \nthe nature of intra-executive budget negotiations. However, these are very selective and again \nlimited to a subset of OECD countries. \n \nDue to the lack of comprehensive cross-national data on procedural fragmentation in the \nexecutive, the focus here is on the legislative arena. The theory of common pool resources \nsuggests that a legislature has greater potential for profligacy than a cabinet, because it typically \ncomprises substantially more actors.v Hence, my expectation is that the interaction between size \nfragmentation and procedural constraints in the legislative arena should be highly relevant for \nfiscal policy outcomes. If the analysis finds evidence for this argument despite the limitations of \nthe available data, this would signal that further empirical work is warranted to test the full \nimplications of the interactive logic. Hence, an important task for future work would be to \ncontribute an analysis of the interaction of size and procedural fragmentation in the cabinet. To \ncarry out such work with large samples requires new and more extensive institutional datasets. \n \nThere are different possible approaches to measuring size fragmentation, depending on whether \nthe relevant decision making unit is a political party, an individual politician, or both. In the \nlegislative arena, the number of seats is hardly changing or completely time-invariant in most \ncountries, and therefore highly correlated with the country fixed effects in the empirical approach \npursued here (see below). Hence, my focus is on partisan fragmentation, which varies much \nmore within countries over time. Moreover, in most countries it is reasonable to assume a degree \nof party discipline. In the political science literature, a popular measure of party political \nfragmentation is Laakso and Taagepera\u2019s (1979) \u2018effective number of parties\u2019 (ENOP): \n 12 \n \nENOP = \n\u20ac \nPartyi2i=1\nn\u2211( )\n\u22121\n \n \nIn this equation, Partyi denotes the share of seats of political party i in the lower house of the \nlegislature (or unicameral parliament) and n is the total number of parties represented. This \nmeasure has gained a high degree of acceptance, although it is not without its quirks (Dunleavy \n& Boucek, 2003). One of its undesirable properties is that it has no predefined upper bound, \nwhich can result in extreme positive skews in the distribution of this variable. This makes the \nmeasure problematic for some datasets, in particular those that are not narrowly focused on the \ntraditional set of Western European or OECD countries.vi For this reason, I prefer another \nHerfindahl-like index of partisan fragmentation: \n \nPartisan fragmentation = \n\u20ac \n1\u2212 Partyi2i=1\nn\u2211  \n \nThis equation generates values between zero (one-party rule) and very close to one (every seat in \nthe lower house or unicameral parliament is held by a different political party or independents). \nBy giving less weight to small parties, this measure is better at dealing with extreme outliers at \nthe upper end of the distribution.vii Also, this size-weighted measure is preferable to the \nunweighted number of parties, which is equally bad at dealing with outliers as Laakso and \nTaagepera\u2019s ENOP. Moreover, large parties are also likely to internalize a large share of the cost \nof their actions, so the theory of common pool resources implies the use of a size-weighted \nmeasure (Franzese, 2008). As a robustness check, I include the equivalent variable for the \nexecutive. Ideally, the partisan fragmentation of the cabinet should be calculated with data on the \n 13 \nparty affiliation of individual spending ministers. However, this information is not readily \navailable. Assuming that portfolios are typically distributed with consideration of the relative \nseat shares of the governing parties in the legislature, the Government partisan fragmentation \nvariable used here serves as a proxy. The data for these two variables are from the World Bank\u2019s \nApril 2008 update of the Database of Political Institutions (Beck et al., 2001). \n \nWith regard to estimation, the possibility that fiscal performance affects the choice of budget \ninstitutions can make it difficult to identify causal effects. This issue is well known in the \npolitical economy literature, but has proven difficult to address (Acemoglu, 2005; Fabrizio & \nMody, 2006, p. 703). Alesina and Perotti (1996, p. 4) point out that institutional features that are \ncostly to change and adjusted rarely can be considered exogenous \u2018at least in the short to medium \nrun\u2019. In this case, there is hardly any over-time variation in legislative amendment powers, which \nare constant over the sample period in all countries except for changes in Peru (1991), Argentina \n(1993), and New Zealand (1996). Moreover, the reform in New Zealand is inconsequential for \nthe coding scheme used here (see Table 1 for details). A fixed effects approach is desirable, as it \nmitigates concerns about unobserved heterogeneity by eliminating bias from time-constant \nomitted variables. In this instance, the unit fixed effects will also absorb much of the explanatory \npower of the rarely changing institutional variables, but there is sufficient within-country \nvariation in partisan fragmentation. Hence, the focus here is on how changes in partisan \nfragmentation affect deficits, given a particular institutional setting. \n \n \n3. Empirical model and results \n 14 \n \nThe discussion in section one unequivocally points to an interactive model (Brambor et al., 2006; \nKam & Franzese, 2007). Accordingly, I model the central government budget deficit in country i \nat time t as follows: \n \nDeficiti,t = \u03b21(Partisan fragmentationi,t) + \u03b22(Amendment limiti,t) + \u03b23(Partisan fragmentationi,t \u00d7 \nAmendment limiti,t) + \u03b24(Deficiti,t-1) + \u03b25(Controlsi,t) + Countryi + Yeart + \u03b5i,t \n \nThe coefficient \u03b21 represents the effect of a one-unit increase in partisan fragmentation when \nthere are no amendment limits, while \u03b22 captures the effect of the imposition of such a limit \nunder perfect one-party rule. The coefficient \u03b23 indicates by how much the effect of partisan \nfragmentation on deficits changes with the imposition of an amendment limit. I include the set of \ncontrols discussed in the previous section, as well as a lagged dependent variable, since a fiscal \noutcome in any given year is to a large extent determined by the outcome in the preceding year \n(Davis et al., 1966). A Hausman test indicates that random effects are not appropriate. Hence, I \nuse the OLS fixed effects estimator, where the unit fixed effects capture any country-specific \nunchanging features.viii Given the rarely changing nature of the institutional conditioning \nvariable, it is highly correlated with the country fixed effects. Therefore, the focus here is on \u03b21 \nand \u03b23. In addition, T - 1 year effects capture common shocks (Greene, 2003, p. 291), and \u03b5 is an \nerror term. \n \nThe above regression equation can be used to identify the marginal effect of partisan \nfragmentation: \n 15 \n \n\u2202(Deficiti,t) \/ \u2202(Partisan fragmentationi,t) = \u03b21 + \u03b23(Amendment limiti,t) \n \nIn this analysis, the conditioning variable is binary and simply indicates the presence or absence \nof limits on legislative amendments to the budget. Unlike in purely linear-additive models, \u03b21 has \nto be interpreted as a conditional coefficient representing the effect of a one-unit increase in \npartisan fragmentation on the deficit when such an amendment constraint is absent (i.e. \nAmendment limit = 0). Conversely, the sum of \u03b21 and \u03b23 captures the effect of a one-unit increase \nin partisan fragmentation in the presence of such a constraint (i.e. Amendment limit = 1). The \ndiscussion in this paper leads me to expect a positive sign for \u03b21, since in the absence of an \neffective amendment limit an increase in the number of decision makers is predicted to lead to \nhigher deficits (the dependent variable is coded so that a positive value represents a deficit and a \nnegative value represents a surplus). As the presence of an amendment constraint is predicted to \ndampen this effect, I expect a negative sign for \u03b23 so that (\u03b21 + \u03b23) < \u03b21. \n \n[TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE] \n \nTable 2 presents the results. In column (1), I add only Partisan fragmentation and Amendment \nlimit to the set of controls. The coefficient for partisan fragmentation has a negative sign and is \nfar from significant. In column (2), I interact the two variables, as specified in the statistical \nmodel. According to the results, a switch from one-party rule to full partisan fragmentation \nincreases deficits by a massive 5.7 percentage points of GDP when there are no limits on \nlegislative amendments. More realistically, an increase from two to three parties with equal seat \n 16 \nshares in the legislature (i.e. an increase in partisan fragmentation from .5 to .67) is predicted to \nadd .95 percentage points to the deficit to GDP ratio. This effect is significant at the 1% level. \nUnder these institutional conditions, partisan fragmentation results in fiscal indiscipline. As \nexpected, the interaction term has a negative sign, and it is also significant at the 1% level. To \nassess the effect of an increase in partisan fragmentation in the presence of an institutional \nconstraint, the bottom of Table 2 also presents the additionally required conditional coefficient(s) \nand standard error(s) for each interactive model. The relevant coefficient reported in column (2) \nhas a negative sign but is not significant at conventional levels. In other words, when legislative \namendment authority is circumscribed, an increase in partisan fragmentation has no significant \neffect on budget deficits. Apart from the lagged dependent variable, the estimates for the controls \nshow that deficits increase in election years and that trade openness improves fiscal performance. \nNone of the other control variables achieve statistical significance at conventional levels. \n \nGraphical exposition can aid the interpretation of conditional marginal effects (Kam & Franzese, \n2007). Figure 2 summarizes the marginal effect of partisan fragmentation on deficits by \ninstitutional setting, based on the results in column (2). With an amendment limit, the 95% \nconfidence interval includes zero. Conversely, with unfettered amendment powers, the marginal \neffect of partisan fragmentation is statistically distinguishable from zero. Moreover, there is no \noverlap between the two sets of confidence intervals. This indicates that the marginal effect of \npartisan fragmentation is statistically distinguishable across the two institutional groups. These \nresults are fully in line with the expectations summarized in Figure 1: Under conditions of \nprocedural fragmentation, size fragmentation leads to fiscal indiscipline. However, with \nprocedural constraints, this effect is contained \u2013 and very effectively so, these results suggest. \n 17 \n \n[FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE] \n \nThe remaining columns in Table 2 present several robustness checks. One possible critique is \nthat formal institutional arrangements and partisan fragmentation may not be as relevant in \nweakly entrenched democracies (Acemoglu, 2005; Elgie & McMenamin, 2008). In column (3), I \nrestrict the sample to countries that have a score of .1 or higher on the Age variable calculated by \nPersson and Tabellini (2003), which measures the age of democracy. This cut-off limits the \nsample to countries that had democratized by 1980. Indeed, the hypothesized effect is stronger in \ncountries with consolidated democracy. Also note that trade openness does not have a significant \neffect in this sample. In column (4), I limit the sample period to all years from 1975 up to and \nincluding 1990. This means that the institutional conditioning variable is completely time \ninvariant and fully absorbed by the country fixed effects. The results for the variables of interest \nare substantively similar to those in column (2). Interestingly, legislative elections have no \nsignificant effect in column (4), which may suggest that electoral manipulation plays a greater \nrole in more recent years. As explained above, in the absence of a measure of procedural \nfragmentation in the cabinet, the interactive argument cannot be explored in the executive \ncontext. However, in column (5) I include a measure of partisan fragmentation in the \ngovernment. This variable is not significant and its inclusion does not substantively affect the \nresults. Finally, I distinguish spending and deficit-based amendment constraints.ix Column (6) \nsuggests that both counteract the effect of an increase in partisan fragmentation, and there is no \nsignificant difference in the size of the coefficients for the two interaction terms. \n \n 18 \nI conducted additional robustness checks, which are not reported here to conserve space. One \npossible critique is that the impact of the European Monetary Union is not adequately modeled. \nIn effect, I have assumed that Maastricht resulted in an immediate structural shift in budget \nbalances in the first 12 countries to enter into monetary union. It is more likely that any effect of \nEurope\u2019s fiscal rules was gradual (Volkerink & De Haan, 2001, p. 236). Hence, I also allowed \nfor the average effect of Maastricht on these 12 countries to differ for each year in the run-up to \nmonetary union. The results suggest that monetary union had a significant negative effect on \ndeficits in the EU12 only in the two years immediately prior to 1999, when the euro became a \nreal currency. While this finding is of interest on its own, most important in this context is that \nthe estimated conditional coefficients for partisan fragmentation are not affected. As a final \nrobustness check, I ran a jackknife test in which I estimated model (2) 57 times, each time \nexcluding all observations from one of the countries. The results remained stable no matter \nwhich country was excluded. In sum, there is robust evidence that partisan fragmentation in the \nlegislature is associated with fiscal indiscipline only when constraints on amendments are absent. \n \n \nConclusions \n \nThe literature on the common pool resource problem in budgeting has explored the fiscal impact \nof a variety of aspects of fragmented decision making. However, previous empirical work pays \ninsufficient attention to the likely interaction between size and procedural fragmentation. The \nargument put forward in this paper is that the effects of these two types of fragmentation should \nnot be additive, but multiplicative, since the impact of size fragmentation on fiscal policy is \n 19 \nconditional on the extent of procedural fragmentation in the budget process. Using panel data for \n57 countries over the period 1975 to 1998, I find consistent evidence that partisan fragmentation \nin the legislature is associated with higher deficits only when it is not moderated by limits on \nparliamentary amendment authority. \n \nThis finding has potentially far-reaching policy implications. Notably, electoral reformers should \nconsider very carefully how the broader institutional environment might condition the economic \neffects of a possible change in partisan fragmentation. For example, if a country were to \nundertake reforms that increase representation, by switching from a plurality rule electoral \nsystem to one based on proportional representation with a low threshold, then the results \npresented here suggest that the likely fiscal ramifications of this reform depend on the budgetary \npowers of the legislature. Moreover, given that these powers are highly durable, initial \nconstitutional choices can shape fiscal policy outcomes for decades to come. Hence, in particular \nin the context of fundamental regime change, when there is a unique window of opportunity to \nreconsider and design a range of political structures, attention needs too be paid to the likely \ninteraction between voter preferences, electoral systems, and budget institutions. \n \nFurther work is warranted. Notably, this analysis lacked an indicator of procedural fragmentation \nin the executive to replicate and complement the analysis of the legislative arena. While the \nliterature on the common pool resource problem in budgeting has identified a number of relevant \nvariables, suitable data are simply not available for a larger set of countries and over an extended \ntime period. With comprehensive data on procedural fragmentation in the executive as well as \nthe legislature, the interactive argument could be tested more fully. Moreover, it would be \n 20 \npossible to take the underlying logic even further, for instance by exploring the interaction of \nfragmentation at different stages of the budget process. This requires new data gathering efforts \nto obtain more fine-grained institutional measures for a large number of countries. The results \npresented here suggest that the payoffs of such work for our understanding of fiscal policy \noutcomes could be substantial. In the next generation of research on fiscal performance, these \nmultiplicative relationships deserve thorough attention. \n 21 \nReferences \nAcemoglu, D. (2005).

Available: www.nytimes.com. \nii Based on a different theoretical argument, the literature on delayed adjustment considers the \nhypothesis that coalition governments find it difficult to modify fiscal policy in the wake of \neconomic shocks (Roubini & Sachs, 1989; Edin & Ohlsson, 1991; De Haan et al., 1999). \nFranzese (2008) provides an overview and critiques the dominant empirical approach. \niii This is also Persson & Tabellini\u2019s (2003) \u2018narrow\u2019 definition of democracy. \niv Notably, Von Hagen (1992, p. 36) initially argued that a global vote on the size of the budget \nprior to allocative decisions contains total spending. However, Ferejohn and Krehbiel (1987) \ndemonstrate that such a two-step process may result in relatively large budgets. Von Hagen later \nrevised his view (Hallerberg & Von Hagen, 1997; Ehrhart et al., 2007). \nv In practice, there are always fewer cabinet members than legislators. Moreover, a cabinet is \nalso likely to contain fewer partisan actors than the legislature, with possible but rare exceptions \nsuch as governments of national unity. \nvi For instance, Nepal prior to the 1991 election had a \u2018non-party\u2019 system of panchayats \n(councils). For these years, the Database of Political Institutions counts each member of the \nlegislature as equivalent to a representative of a unique political party, resulting in scores for the \n(effective) number of parties of up to 140. This produces an extreme outlier in this sample. \nvii Results with a logged version of ENOP are very similar and available upon request. \nviii In dynamic models with fixed effects, a potential problem is Nickell bias (Nickell, 1981). \nHowever, this is less of a concern when the number of time periods is twenty or more (Beck & \nKatz, 2004, p. 15). \nix Note that Spending limit and Deficit limit are defined here as mutually exclusive types of \namendment constraints. \n"}
