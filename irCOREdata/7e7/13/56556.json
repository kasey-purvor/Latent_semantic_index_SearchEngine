Introduction \nOver the period 1990-1992, the world economy was going through a rough \npatch exacerbated by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the Gulf War and its aftermath. \nAt the same time, public reports of India\u2019s financial problems generated rumors of an \nimpending crisis and caused the rapid downgrading of Indian Eurobonds from A2 to \nBaa1 to Baa3 to Ba2 within the short space of a year.2 The situation was further \ncomplicated by political turmoil surrounding the general elections of 1991, the \nassassination of Rajiv Gandhi, a prominent candidate, in May 1991 by Sri Lankan \nguerillas and a stock market scam involving government and banking officials in April-\nMay of 1992. As a result of all this, international credit became scarce and shorter-term \nrollover debt became more costly. Indeed, bond issues ceased completely for several \nyears. However, India never defaulted or rescheduled its debt. In spite of its foreign \nexchange difficulties, it put a brake on its foreign borrowings and with the help of \nforeign exchange loans and advice from the IMF, after 44 years of socialism, proceeded \nwith a structural, market oriented reform of the economy.3 By 1993 the crisis had \npassed. The question that we ask in this paper is to what extent India\u2019s financial \ndifficulties were the result of conditions prevailing on the international capital markets \nat the time as reflected in the international, risk-free term structure of interest rates and \nto what extent they were linked to credit risk specific to the country\u2019s political \nenvironment and its economic and financial management as reflected in the three \nranking migrations. \n \n This paper makes a first contribution with respect to the literature on India\u2019s \neconomy. First of all, we show that economic and financial conditions prevailing in the \n                                                 \n2 Defined by Moodys. A2 indicates a good ability to repay while Baa3 is indicative of junk bonds and Ba2 is speculative.  \n 4  \nrest of the world, reflected in the international, risk-free term structure of interest rates, \nare the major determinants in changes in Indian Eurobond prices and its component cost \nof borrowing. Secondly, we show the impact of changes in India\u2019s internal political \nenvironment and its economic and financial management, reflected in the three \ndowngrades in less than a year - from A2 to Baa1 on October 4, 1990, from Baa1 to \nBaa3 on March 26, 1991 and from Baa3 to Ba2 on June 24, 1991 \u2013 on the country\u2019s \nbond prices and component cost of borrowing were relatively small. \n \nThis paper makes a second contribution with respect to the literature on credit \nratings and sovereign debt. In fact, very little work has been done on pricing the impact \nof migration on sovereign and quasi-sovereign debt. One of the reasons for this is that \nfew sovereigns and almost no low credit quality sovereigns have ratings histories longer \nthan a decade. Therefore, estimating the transition matrices is difficult, especially in so \nfar as very few government bonds have a history of sufficient in-sample rating \nmigrations.4 For example, Duffie et al. (2001) have only one event in their study. In this \npaper, there are three migrations and the effect of each one is measured explicitly. \n \nThe effect of credit ratings is important because credit ratings play a major role \nin determining a borrower\u2019s cost of credit and access to the capital markets.5 They now \nconstitute the basic infrastructure for many models designed to measure credit risk, such \nas CreditMetrics from JP Morgan or the KMV methodology from KMV Corporation \n                                                                                                                                               \n3 See Appendix 1 for details of the reform program. \n4Hu, Kiesel and Perraudin (2001) attempt to extract information from sovereign defaults observed over a longer period and a broader set of countries to derive \nestimates of sovereign transition matrices. However this is only an estimate for a broad group of countries and hence may not be precise. \n5 Globalization of the world\u2019s capital markets has intensified their importance. \n 5  \n(now part of Moody\u2019s).6 Furthermore, ratings, migration and transition probabilities7 \nplay a prominent role in credit risk management and the pricing of credit derivatives.8 \nThey are also prominent in plans for the next step in the regulatory capital standard for \nbanks, which currently admits internal models for market risk and now calls for the \ndevelopment of a value-at-risk (VAR) framework for credit risk. \n \nThe specific relationship between credit ratings and sovereign debt is important \nbecause sovereign debt differs from corporate debt in several fundamental ways, which \nare likely to influence investors\u2019 perceptions of ratings where sovereigns are concerned \nand their reaction to sovereign rating changes when they occur:  \n1. There is no recognized legal framework for sorting out sovereign defaults.9 Because \nof this and the principle of sovereignty, in a sovereign default creditors have very \nlittle scope for seizing assets as is the case in corporate defaults.  \n2.  Largely as a result of 1, the resolution of sovereign defaults has usually included \nthe rescheduling of outstanding contractual maturities, i.e., the transformation of \ncontractual maturities into longer-term liabilities. This introduces an element of \nuncertainty regarding the actual maturities of the contractual cash flows. \n3. The uncertainty regarding the cash flow maturities is compounded by what is known \nas the sovereign\u2019s \u201cwillingness\u201d to pay. The creditworthiness of a corporate \nborrower depends, for all practical purposes, on its ability to pay, whereas for a \nsovereign borrower, besides the ability to pay, creditworthiness depends on the \n                                                 \n6 Other methods for credit risk measurement include expert systems and subjective analysis, and accounting based credit-scoring systems. See Altman and \nSaunders (1998) for a review of credit risk measurement techniques over the last 20 years.  \n7 Transition probabilities refer to the probabilities that a country will migrate from its current rating to \nanother rating over a given period of time, usually one year. \n8 See Kao (2000) for a review of the development of modeling and pricing credit risk and the statistical properties of credit spread behavior over time.  \n9 There are semi-official organizations such as the Paris Club for sovereign creditors and the London \nClub for private creditors. \n 6  \ngovernment\u2019s willingness or unwillingness to pay even if it has the ability.10 A \nvariable like this is very difficult to measure and integrate in a systematic manner \ninto a rating system, which is based fundamentally on the ability to pay. Thus, \ndefault and transition probabilities for sovereigns are less reliable and more difficult \nto interpret than they are for corporates.  \n \nThe paper also makes a contribution to the literature on credit risk analysis in \nthat it provides an innovative methodology for measuring the pure impact of migrations \non bond prices and interest rate spreads. The difficulty in doing this is linked to the \ndifficulty of disentangling pure credit risk from market risk. As Jarrow and Turnbull \n(2000) point out, market and credit risk are intrinsically related to each other and are not \ninseparable.11 Market risk generated by an unexpected change in the firm\u2019s assets also \naffects the probability of default, thereby generating credit risk as well. Conversely, \ncredit risk generated by an unexpected change in the probability of default also affects \nthe value of the firm, thereby generating market risk. Furthermore, market participants \noften anticipate forthcoming credit events before they actually happen so that prices \nadjust to the new credit status before the rating agencies have been able to effectively \nchange the ratings. Where sovereign debt is concerned these problems are complicated \nby the fact that the concept of asset values that underpin the debt do not apply, as we \nhave seen above. \n \nResearch looking at separating market risk and credit risk is substantial and \ngrowing. The main approach, based on Merton (1974, 1977), views bonds as contingent \n                                                 \n10 See, for example, Clark and Zenaidi (1999). \n 7  \nclaims on the borrowers\u2019 assets. The credit event is modeled as timing risk when the \nassets of the borrower reach a threshold. In Merton (1974, 1977), Black and Cox \n(1976), Ho and Singer (1982), Chance (1990) and Kim, Ramaswamy and Sundaresan \n(1993) default is modeled as occurring at debt maturity if the assets of the borrower are \nless than the amount of the debt due. More recent models starting with Longstaff and \nSchwartz (1995) have randomized the timing of the default event determined by when \nthe value of the assets hits a pre-determined barrier. Other papers such as Jarrow and \nTurnbull (1995), Madan and Unal (1998) and Duffie and Singleton (1999) model the \ntiming of the default event as a Poisson process or a doubly stochastic Poisson process \n(Lando, 1994). \n \nThe four basic approaches for estimating the impact of a rating change on the \nprice of a bond are summarized in Altman (1998). The first involves multiplying the \nchange in the yield spread between the initial rating and the new rating by the bond\u2019s \nmodified duration. This approach mixes market risk and credit risk and makes the \nunrealistic assumptions of no changes in the term structure of interest rates or in \nduration. A second approach applies event study methodology to directly observe the \nprice changes of a large sample of bonds from different rating categories. The problem \nhere is to ascertain the correct event date because by the time the rating has changed, it \nis probably too late. Furthermore, no distinction is made between changes due to market \nconditions and pure credit changes. A third approach discounts the bond\u2019s cash flows \nusing the forward zero coupon curve for bonds in the new rating class. Again, no \ndistinction is made between market risk and pure credit risk and the assumption is that \n                                                                                                                                               \n11Without distinguishing between market risk and credit risk, Aronovich (1999) and Erb, Harvey and Viskanta (1996) show a strong negative relationship between \nthe country credit rating and international borrowing cost. \n 8  \ndifferentials between yield curves in the different rating categories are due exclusively \nto credit risk. Finally, the fourth approach decomposes the observed market spreads of \nbonds in various rating classes and uses the historical rating drift patterns to estimate \nthe consequences of a rating change. The problem here again is that neither the spreads \nnor the drift patterns distinguish between market risk and credit risk.  \n  \nOur approach distinguishes explicitly between market fluctuations and rating \nchanges. It involves estimating the cost of both simultaneously. It also incorporates a \ntime varying term structure of interest rates. Thus, the paper contributes to the empirical \nside of the sovereign debt literature. However, our goal is more modest than most \nstudies. Rather than testing a bond pricing model such as Merrick (1999) for Argentine \nand Russian bonds or Keswani (1999) and Pag\u00e8s (2000) on Latin American Brady \nbonds or Dullman and Windfuhr (2000) on European government credit spreads, we \nseek simply to measure the effect of rating migration on sovereign bond prices and \nyields. To this end, we proceed in 3 steps: \n1. We establish the relationship in the absence of migration between a risky bond and a \ntheoretical bond similar in every way to the risky bond except that it is riskless. \n2. We compute the riskless term structure of interest rates and use it to calculate the \nprice of the theoretical bond. \n3. We use regression analysis to estimate the relationship between the risky and \ntheoretical bonds to compute the price changes in the risky bond due to changes in \nthe riskless term structure (market risk) along with dummy variables timed to the \ndowngrade to measure the effect of migration on the price of the risky bond. \n \n 9  \nWhen this methodology is applied to the case of Indian Eurobonds 1990-1992, \nour results show that there are no maturity, currency or bond specific effects of \nmigration on percentage changes in the bond prices. However, when we measure the \ncost of migration in terms of basis points on the yield to maturity, we find that migration \nis relatively more costly for shorter maturities.  Averaging over all bonds, the first \nmigration added about 106 basis points to the bonds\u2019 yields to maturity while the third \nmigration added about 42. The second migration was very small and not statistically \nsignificant, indicating that it was anticipated by the markets and priced in the first \ndowngrade.  \n \nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we develop the \nrelationship between the risky and theoretical riskless bonds. Section 3 describes the \ndata and outlines the methodology for testing. Section 4 presents the results, which \ninclude cubic spline estimates, the Im, Pesaran, and Shin (1995) T-bar test for \nstationarity in the dependent and independent variables as well as control tests of the \nmigration coefficients controlling for currency effects, maturity effects and specific \nbond effects. Section 5 concludes.  \n \n \n \n \n2. Modeling the Relationship between the Risky and Theoretical Bonds \n In order to measure price changes in the risky bond due to changes in the term \nstructure of interest rates, we construct a theoretical bond or series of bonds identical in  \nevery way to the bond(s) under consideration except that the price(s) of the theoretical \nbond(s) are determined by the riskless zero coupon term structure of interest rates. In the \nabsence of credit risk, changes in the price of the theoretical bond(s) will be due \n 10  \nexclusively to changes in the term structure. We then determine the relationship between \nthe price of the theoretical bond and the observed bond. We define changes in the price of \nthe observed bond that are due to this relationship as market risk. \n \nConsider the following notation: \niT0  = the price of theoretical bond i at time 0. \n+= 1tr the riskless zero coupon rate for period t. \ntC  = the cash flow for period t. \niP0  = the observed price of bond i at time 0. \n+= 1tR  the risk adjusted zero coupon rate for period t. \nin  = maturity date of bond i. \nThe observed and theoretical prices of bond i are given as \n \ni\nii\nn\nn\ni\nn\niii RCRCRCP \u2212\u2212\u2212 +++= K2221110                     (1) \n \ni\nii\nn\nn\ni\nn\niii rCrCrCT \u2212\u2212\u2212 +++= K2221110                         (2) \n \nFirst differencing gives \n \ni\nii\nii\nn\nnn\nn\ni\nni\niii\nR\ndR\nRCn\nR\ndRRC\nR\ndRRCdP \u2212\u2212\u2212 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212= K\n2\n22\n22\n1\n11\n11 21          (3) \n \ni\nii\nii\nn\nnn\nn\ni\nni\niii\nr\ndr\nrCn\nr\ndrrC\nr\ndrrCdT \u2212\u2212\u2212 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212= K\n2\n22\n22\n1\n11\n11 21                (4) \n 11  \n \n To simplify the demonstration but with very little loss of generality we assume \nthat changes in the term structures are linked to the short term riskless rate by functions \nof time such that \n \n1\n1)(\nr\ndrtG\nR\ndR\nt\nt =                                 (5) \n \n1\n1)(\nr\ndrtg\nr\ndr\nt\nt =                                  (6) \n \n Divide equation 3 by iP0  and equation 4 by \niT0  and substitute equations 5 and 6  \n \ni\nn\nt\nt\nttii\nP\ntGRtC\nrdr\nPdP\ni\n0\n1\n11\n0\n)(\u2211\n=\n\u2212\n\u2212=                 (7) \n \ni\nn\nt\nt\nttii\nT\ntgrtC\nrdr\nTdT\ni\n0\n1\n11\n0\n)(\u2211\n=\n\u2212\n\u2212=                  (8) \n \n Equation 7 gives the elasticity of the observed bond with respect to the short-\nterm riskless interest rate while equation 8 gives a measure of the duration of the \ntheoretical bond, which is also its elasticity with respect to the short term riskless rate. \nDenote the right hand side (RHS) of equation 7 as iE  and the RHS of equation 8 as iD , \nisolate 11 rdr , equate the two and rearrange. This gives \n 12  \n \ni\ni\ni\ni T\ndT\nD\nE\nP\ndP\n00\n=                          (9) \n \n Equation 9 measures percentage changes in the observed bond\u2019s market value as \nproportional to percentage changes in the theoretical bond. The proportion is equal to \nthe ratio of the elasticities of the observed and theoretical bonds with respect to the \nshort-term riskless interest rate, which is, by definition, exclusive of credit risk. Since \npure term structure changes reflect changes in the equilibrium conditions on the capital \nmarkets, equation 9 captures the market risk for bond i. \n \n3. Data and Methodology \n3.1 Estimating the Riskless Term Structure of Interest Rates \n In order to estimate the market risk, we need to estimate the riskless zero coupon \nterm structure of interest rates. Although several models such as Carleton and Cooper \n(1976), Schaefer (1981), Vasichek and Fong (1982), Chambers, Carleton and Waldman \n(1984), Mastronikola (1991) exist to estimate the term structure, Shea (1985) compares \nthem and finds McCulloch\u2019s cubic spline model empirically tractable, easily computable by \nOLS and parsimonious.12 Furthermore, Litzenberger and Rolfo (1984), Luther and Matatko \n(1992), Deacon and Derry (1994 a and b) and Bradley (1991) have successfully applied \nthis model in their empirical studies. In this study we use the McCulloch cubic spline.13 \n \n                                                 \n12 The advantage of this is the presence of a global optimum instead of a multitude of local optima generated by a highly non-linear model such as Cox, Ingersoll \nand Ross (1985).   \n13 We also estimate the Cox, Ingersoll Ross (1985) model as a control. Our results show that both methods give very similar results. \n 13  \nThe model involves fitting a smooth discount function to information obtained from \nobserved prices of straight bonds with various coupons and maturities by estimating the \ncoefficients for a linear combination of smooth approximating functions forming a cubic \nspline. This estimated discount function can then be inverted to obtain the term structure of \ninterest rates. It can be used to price bonds, obtain the par yield curve, zero coupon yield \ncurve and other related data and is the standard procedure in term structure theory.14 The \nequation we estimate has the form \n  \n[ ] (10)                *)(*)(1100\n*)(*)(\n3\n222\n3\n111\n32\n3\n222\n3\n111\n32\nethhDVthhDVhhh\nthhDVthhDVhhhnCAIP\nnnnnnnn\niiiiiii\n+\u2212+\u2212++++\n+\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1 \u2212+\u2212++++=+ \u2211\u2211\u2211\u2211\u2211\n\u03b3\u03b3\u03b3\u03b2\u03b1\n\u03b3\u03b3\u03b3\u03b2\u03b1\n \n \nwhere P is the clean price, AI is the accrued coupon, C is the coupon, n is the total number \nof coupons left, hi is the date to the first coupon, i=1 to number of coupons left to maturity, \ni.e n, and hn is the date of the last cash flow. DV represents dummy variables representing \nthe spline knots if time left to maturity of the bond is greater than t(.)*. Taking a large cross \nsection of bonds in a market at a point in time with differing market prices, diverse coupons \nand times to maturities and using regression allows the estimation of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b31 and \u03b32 using \nordinary  least squares in (10). The error term in the regression ensures that random effects \nare captured. Repeating this exercise over time generates a time series of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b31 and \u03b32. \n \n3.2 Data Set \n                                                 \n14 The detail of the methodology is available on request. \n 14  \nThe market prices of Indian bonds and data for modeling the term structure was \nobtained from the Handbooks published by the International Securities Market Association \n(ISMA), formerly known as the Association of International Bond Dealers (AIBD).  \n \nOur data is quarterly and the observation period runs from June 29, 1990, four \nmonths before the first downgrade, to September 30, 1992, the end of the crisis, a total of \n10 observations for each bond. The quarterly window was chosen, based on the timing of \nthe downgrades, as the smallest window wide enough to encompass price variations due to \nanticipated changes in pure credit risk that had not yet been formalized by a downgrade.  \nOur sample is the subset of eight Indian bonds with varying amounts and maturities issued \nby public sector and quasi public sector borrowers - 3 in USD, 4 in DEM and 1 in JPY - \nthat remained outstanding over the entire observation period. We also considered the Fung \nand Rudd (1986) argument that the time period should be not be too close to the issue date \nof any bond, since these prices often mirror issue costs along with interest-rate driven price \nmovements. There were no direct sovereign issues made but all the above issuers were \nunder the control, management and ownership of the Government of India and were \nguaranteed by it. Apart from ONGC, they are all financial institutions. The details of \nthese bonds are given in Table 1. \n \n(Insert Table 1)  \n \nTo estimate the riskless term structure in the unregulated, tax-free Eurobond market \nof 1990-1992, we constructed sample sets for each observation date of not less than 50 \n 15  \nbonds15 issued by officially backed supranationals, for each of the three currencies \nconstituting India\u2019s external debt - US dollars, German marks, and Japanese yen.16 We use \nthe supranationals to estimate the international riskless term structure rather than the \ncorresponding treasuries in order to avoid biases that can creep into national credit markets \nthrough taxes, regulations, government intervention and the like. The supranationals \nincluded in our sample are guaranteed at least de facto by their member governments and \nborrow at terms equivalent to, and at times better than, the treasuries of the currencies in \nquestion. Thus, they are effectively riskless and give the best picture of the international \nriskless term structure of interest rates. The large number of bonds in each sample was \nnecessary to ensure the desirable asymptotic qualities of consistency and sufficiency. To \nensure a balanced sample over the whole term structure, bonds in equal numbers were \nchosen with term left to maturity of less than three years, between three and six years, and \nover six years. \n \n3.3 The Methodology \nWe proceed in three steps. \n\u2022 We estimate the riskless term structure for each time period, developed from \nMcCulloch\u2019s cubic spline methodology, on the cross section of supranational bonds \nin the USD market, the JPY market and the DEM market. This gives us three time \nseries for the riskless term structure, one in USD, one in DEM, and one in JPY. \n \n                                                 \n15 Most studies like Brown and Dybvig (1986) use the same dataset. However, even when the currency market was the same, in this study, the data set was varied \nto enable the use of very short bonds. This was to prevent the underestimation of the very short end of the yield curve to the extent of the time between June 1990 \nand September 1992. The June 1990 observations would have had to otherwise include observations at least 27 months away from maturity. \n16 These issuers include the World Bank, Eurofima, the European Investment Bank, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank etc., \n 16  \nIn the estimation of the riskless yield curve, we used two spline17 knot points of \nthree and six years. The choice of these two points was based on the observation that the \nEurobond market typically deals in shorter maturities than their respective domestic bond \nmarkets. Thus, we reasoned that the break points for investor perceptions of uncertainty, \nliquidity and risk in the Eurobond market could reasonably be represented as relatively \nshort term: up to three years, relatively medium term: between three and six years, and \nrelatively long term: above six years. \n \nAlthough bond prices are quoted clean in the Eurobond market, i.e. they are quoted \nfree from any accrued coupon in order to facilitate yield comparisons, the actual sale is on \nthe basis of the dirty price, i.e. the clean price cum accrued interest.18 In order to take this \ninto account, dirty prices were computed accordingly on the basis of days the bond was not \nheld by the buyer.19 The ask prices were used to compute the dirty prices.20 \n \nUsing observed values of prices, coupons and times to maturity, Ordinary Least \nSquares (OLS) regressions were run on SHAZAM to estimate the term structure \nparameters, which were then used to compute the discount curve and the spot rate curve. \n                                                 \n17A spline is a model which incorporates switching coefficients of regression in two or more periods of time. To make this a smooth transition and to estimate it, it \nis essential that two regression lines meet at a switching point (knot) in a manner that in the example of a cubic spline satisfies the following; \n \nYt=\u03b11+\u03b21Xt+\u03b31Xt2+d1Xt3+et       (t=1,2...,t*) \n \nYt=\u03b12+\u03b22Xt+\u03b32Xt2+d2Xt3+et       (t=t*+1,t*+2...,n) \nThe requirement is that at point t=t* the first and second derivative of these curves be the same. \n18 See equation 10. \n19Unlike more imprecise methods like Chambers et al (1984) who computed interest accrued to the nearest quarter, dirty prices used in this study were precise to \nthe day. \n19There were two other choices in this matter : \n1)Bid prices could have been used on the argument that they are prices the market makers are ready to buy at, or  \n2)The midpoint of the two,  i.e. the mean of the bid and ask price could have been used. However it was found that the bid-ask spread was very narrow in the \nmarket. In view of this we found it reasonable to calculate the prices on the basis of ask quotations along with the accrued coupon. \n 17  \nThe discount curve was computed for twelve years to allow comparability between data \nsets. \n\u2022 We then apply the corresponding riskless term structure for each time period to each \nof the Indian Eurobonds in our sample to estimate their \u201ctheoretical riskless price\u201d. \nThis gives us eight time series, one for each bond, of the theoretical riskless price of \nthe Indian Eurobonds in the sample. The theoretical riskless price represents what \nthe market price of the bonds would be at each period if they were devoid of pure \ncredit risk: their prices would vary only with changes in the conditions of capital \nmarket equilibrium reflected in the term structure.21 \n\u2022 Next, we use the \u201ctheoretical riskless prices\u201d in the relationship developed in \nequation 9 to measure to what extent variations in the observed prices of the Indian \nbonds are explained by market risk, that is, by variations in the riskless term \nstructure reflected in variations in the theoretical bond prices. We test the equation \nti\nt\ni\ni\nt\ni\nT\ndTaa\nP\ndP \u03b5++= 21             (11) \nwhere 1a  is a constant, 2a  is the coefficient (which may be time varying) \ncorresponding in equation 9 to ii DE , the ratio of the elasticity of the observed \nbond with respect to the short term riskless interest rate and the duration of the \ntheoretical bond. The symbol \u03b5  represents the error term.  \n \n\u2022 Finally, after checking for robustness, we introduce a dummy variable for each \nmigration along with the theoretical bond prices to estimate the magnitude and \nsignificance of pure credit risk. The assumption here is that the quarterly window is \n 18  \nwide enough to capture price changes due to anticipated migrations. After \ncontrolling for robustness, we then use the estimated coefficients to calculate the \ncost of the pure credit risk measured in basis points. \n \n4.

The results, not \nreported here but available on request, of the 30 regression coefficients, i.e., the three \ncurrency markets over ten time periods, are very good, although not all the parameters \nare always statistically significant.22  The \u03b1 coefficient is always significant and always \nnegative for all three currencies. The results are best for the dollar. The \u03b2 and \u03b3 \ncoefficients are usually significant at the 5% level. Otherwise, except in one case, they \nare significant at the 10% level. The curvature coefficients represented by 1\u03b3  and 2\u03b3  \nare also often significant at the 5% level and usually significant at the 10% level, more \nso for 1\u03b3  than 2\u03b3 , thereby indicating more curvature effect at the short end of the \nstructure than the long end. For the yen, the \u03b2 and \u03b3 coefficients are usually significant \nat the 10% level. However, 1\u03b3  and 2\u03b3  are clearly significant together in only three \nperiods: June 1990, March 1991, and December 1991. In March 1992 short-term \ncurvature is significant and in June 1992 long term curvature is significant. For the \nmark no parameters except \u03b1 are significant at the beginning of the observation period. \nHowever, starting in March 1991 \u03b2 becomes significant at the 5% level and \u03b3 at the \n10% level. Except for June 1991, they stay significant until the last period, September \n1992. The curvature coefficients are only sigificant in December 1991 and June 1992. \n                                                                                                                                               \n21 We also estimate the yield curve using the Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (1985) model, which gives similar results. These results are not reported here but are \navailable on request. \n 19  \n \nWe used the parameters estimated above to compute the yield curves and discount \nfunctions and compared the results with those estimated with the Cox, Ingersoll and Ross \n(1985) model.23 They are almost indistinguishable, which is strong evidence for their \naccuracy. The shape of the yield curve showed a consistently upward sloping curve for the \ndollar market. The yen long-term rate fell below the short-term rate from September 1991 \nto March 1992, down to almost 0, in the last two mentioned time periods. In two cases it \nwas almost the same as the short-term rate i.e. in September 1990 and March 1991. During \nthis period i.e. from June 1990 to March 1991, it was only marginally above the short rate. \nDuring the remaining last period however, the difference widened. The DEM yield curves \nshowed either the interest rate at the long end to be roughly of the same magnitude as the \nshort, or inverted. During this period, Germany was also undergoing the event of re-\nunification and the yield curve was inverted. In summary, the shape of the two ends of the \nyield curves seems satisfactory. \n \n4.2 Indian Bonds, Market Risk and Migration \n \nWe then applied the foregoing riskless term structures to each of the Indian \nbonds in our sample for each observation period in order to estimate their theoretical \nprices. In all, 80 observations were collated (10 quarters \u00d7 8 bonds) from the thirty yield \ncurves (3 currency markets \u00d7 10 quarters). When we compare the theoretical price with \nthe observed price, we find that there are only four instances out of 80 where the \ntheoretical price was below the observed price. This is further evidence that we have \n                                                                                                                                               \n22 The results of the Breusch Pagan Test, not reported here, show that the null hypothesis of homoscedasticity could not be rejected in most cases at the 10% \nsignificance level. \n23 Results available on request. \n 20  \naccurately captured the riskless term structure. Table 2 shows that for every bond, the \naverage theoretical prices were higher than those of the corresponding market prices. \n \n(Insert Table 2) \n \n \nIn graphs 1-8 we can see the evolution of the theoretical bond price, the actual bond price \nand the 6-month LIBOR of the corresponding currency. \n \n[insert graphs 1-8] \n \nIt is interesting that short-term interest rates were generally decreasing for the dollar \nand the yen while mark rates were mixed. It is also interesting that the discount on the \nactual bond prices with respect to the theoretical price was at first increasing and then \ndecreasing over the period. The change in the discount could be due to variations in the risk \npremium. On the other hand, it could also be due to variations in the term structure or some \ncombination of the two. Since there is no risk premium associated with the theoretical price \nbecause it is estimated with the riskless term structure, the theoretical price will vary only \nwith respect to the particular bond characteristics or variations in the term structure. To see \nto what extent the discount is due to the structure of the yield curve and the particular \nbond characteristics, we test the actual prices with respect to the theoretical prices (8 bonds \nx 10 time periods) proposed in equation 9. \n \n First we test for stationarity in the panel data series tPdP \/  and tTdT \/  using the \nIm, Pesaran, and Shin (1995) T-bar test as applied in Wu and Chen (1999). The Z scores \n 21  \nare \u201318.76 and \u201314.33 respectively. The corresponding 95% critical values are \n09177.3\u00b1  generated by the Monte Carlo simulations.24 Thus we reject non-stationarity. \n \nWe use equation 11, \u03b5++= tt TdTaaPdP 21 , to test the relationship developed \nin equation 9. To overcome the problems of heteroskedasticity and cross sectional \ncorrelation arising from the data pooled over 8 bonds and 10 time periods, we used the \nKmenta (1990) full cross-sectionally correlated and time-wise autogressive model.25 \nWe expect 1a  to be equal to zero and 2a  to be positive.26 The results are reported in table 3. \nThey show that 1a  is very small and not statistically different from zero with a p-value of \n0.3.27 On the other hand, 2a  is highly significant with a p-value of 0.00 and, as expected, it \nis positive.28 Furthermore, the overall equation is very good with an 2R  of over 99% and no \nevidence of autocorrelation in the residuals. This suggests that the variation in the \ninternational risk-free term structure of interest rates explains almost all of the price \nvariations in the Eurobonds. There is, however, the possibility that the ii DE , reflected in \n2a , may vary over the time period under consideration. Given that we expect the actual and \ntheoretical bond prices to be non-stationary but co-integrated, as indicated in figures 1-8, \nby regressing first differences upon each other without the error correction term, the point \nestimates potentially suffer bias. More specifically, if we use equation 9 with a potentially \ntime varying coefficient, the estimates for 2a  may suffer from omitted variable bias. To test \nfor this we re-estimate equation 11 and include the error correction term. The results \nsuggest that there is nothing to be gained by including this term. The coefficient 1a  remains \n                                                 \n24 Details of the simulations are available on request. \n25 We found that the Kmenta model worked best with no correction for autocorrelation. \n26 See equations 7 and 8. \n27 Tests for bond specific fixed effects were also negative at conventional levels of significance \n 22  \nsmall and insignificant, 2a  is of the same order of magnitude (0.71 as opposed to 0.77) and \nsignificance (p = 0.00) as when the error correction term is omitted but the adjusted 2R  falls \nto 0.55. Thus, we conclude that our results in table 3 do not suffer from the absence of the \nerror correction term. \n \n(Insert Table 3) \n \nTo account for the effect of migration, we add three dummy variables, one for each \ndowngrade, with the value of 1 for the quarter that the downgrade occurred and zeros \neverywhere else and test the equation29 \n \nttt DbDbDbTdTaaPdP \u03b5+++++= 321 32143              (12) \n \nwhere D1, D2, and D3 represent the dummy variables for the first, second and third \ndowngrades respectively. With the inclusion of the dummy variables, we have no \nexpectations about 3a , which will capture any constant effects associated with pure credit \nrisk. We expect that 4a  will be similar to 2a  and that 1b , 2b , and 3b  will be small and \nnegative. \n(Insert Table 4) \n \n                                                                                                                                               \n28 Tests for bond specific slope effects confirm that the slopes for the individual bonds are all positive at conventional levels of significance.  \n29 Though the downgrades were only for rated bonds we used the downgrade to apply to all Indian bonds, including those that were non-rated. Later we tested \nthrough a regression whether there was any difference between the rated and non rated bonds and found no significant difference. The regression was \n\u03b5++++++= 4321 3432143 DbDbDbDbTdTaaPdP  \nwhere D34 was the dummy for non rated issuer. The coefficent b34 insignificant for D34. Full regression results are available on request. \n 23  \n Table 4 shows the results. As expected, 4a  is similar to 2a , changing by only \n0.01872 with an undiminished p-value and suggests that a 1% change in the price of the \ntheoretical bond causes about a 0.79% change in the price of the Eurobond. All three \ndummy variable coefficients are small and have the right sign but only the first and third \ndowngrades are significant. The explanation for this is probably that the second downgrade \nwas anticipated when the first downgrade occurred. The lower adjusted 2R  of 0.9831 \nreflects the inclusion of the insignificant dummy variable. \n \n We ultimately intend to use the migration coefficients to estimate the cost of \nmigration for the individual bonds in the sample. The coefficients in Table 4 are averages \nfor all the bonds but the migration effect will very possibly be influenced by other factors \nthat differ across bonds, such as currency of issue, the maturity of the issue and \ncharacteristics specific to individual bonds such as coupon rate, payout schedules, \nembedded options and the like. To get a more nuanced estimate of the cost of migration, we \ntest for each of these effects. \n \n First, we check for special effects associated with the individual currencies. \nVariables D4, D5, and D6 take the value of 1 for downgrades 1, 2, and 3 respectively for \nthe USD and zeros everywhere else. Variables D7, D8, and D9 are the same but refer to the \nDEM. We test the equation \n \nt\ni\nitt DibDbDbDbTdTaaPdP \u03b5\u2211\n=\n++++++=\n9\n4\n32143 321           (13) \nFrom the results given in Table 5 we see that none of the new dummies are significant and \nconclude that there is no currency effect. \n 24  \n \n(Insert Table 5) \n \n Next, we check for a maturity effect by adding dummies D10, D11, and D12 that \ntake the value of 1 for migrations 1, 2, and 3 respectively for bonds with maturities greater \nthan 3 years and zeros everywhere else. We test the equation \n \nt\ni\nitt DibDbDbDbTdTaaPdP \u03b5\u2211\n=\n++++++=\n12\n10\n32143 321             (14) \n \n \nFrom the results given in Table 6 we see that the coefficients for dummies 10 and \n12 are not significant. The coefficient for dummy 11 is significant but is associated with \ndowngrade 2, which is not significant. We conclude that there is no maturity effect. \n \n \n(Insert Table 6) \n \n \n Finally, we check whether there are any other special effects associated with the \nindividual bonds. Dummy variables D13 to D19 take the value of 1 for the first \ndowngrade for bonds 1 through 7 and zero everywhere else. Dummy variables D20 to \nD26 take the value of 1 for the second downgrade for bonds 1 through 7 and zero \neverywhere else. Dummy variables D27 to D33 take the value of 1 for the third \ndowngrade for bonds 1 through 7 and zero everywhere else. We test the equations \n \nt\ni\nitt DibDbTdTaaPdP \u03b5\u2211\n=\n++++=\n19\n13\n143 1                                    (15) \n 25  \nt\ni\nit DibDbTdTaaPdP \u03b5\u2211\n=\n++++=\n26\n20\n243 2                                    (16) \nt\ni\nitt DibDbTdTaaPdP \u03b5\u2211\n=\n++++=\n33\n27\n343 3                                    (17) \n \nPanels A, B, and C of Table 7 give the results for equations 15, 16, and 17 \nrespectively.  None of the coefficients for the new dummy variables is significant.  \nTherefore, we conclude that there are no individual bond effects. \n \n(Insert Table 7) \n \n Overall, we conclude that the coefficients for rating changes estimated in \nequation 12 accurately measure the effect of migration on Indian bond prices over the \nsample period. The first downgrade was highly significant and caused a fall of a little \nmore than 3% in the price of the bonds. The second downgrade, which occurred in the \nperiod immediately following the first downgrade, was not significant, probably \nbecause its effects were anticipated in the coefficient of the first downgrade. \nAnticipation of the second downgrade would explain why the coefficient of the first \ndowngrade is almost three times higher than the coefficient of the third downgrade, \nwhich is also highly significant, causing a fall of a little more than 1% in the price of the \nbonds. When we control for other factors that might influence the effect of migration on \nthe bond prices, i.e. currency of issue, maturity and other factors specific to individual \nbonds, none are significant.  \n \nThe implication is that there are no currency, maturity or bond specific effects \nassociated with migration. While this outcome might be considered somewhat \n 26  \ncounterintuitive, the explanation can probably be found in the de facto nature of sovereign \ndebt. Contrary to the corporate sector, outright sovereign defaults or repudiations are rare \nbecause there is no scope for asset recovery. Restructuring and renegotiation is more \ncommon. In fact, Bulow and Rogoff (1989) report that the same bond may be renegotiated \nrepeatedly. Consequently, contractual cash flow maturities are negotiable with a random \nelement, thereby making it difficult to discriminate between shorter and longer-term \nmaturities. Furthermore, the sovereign \u201cwillingness to pay\u201d factor is insensitive to maturity, \ncurrency and individual bond covenants and thereby reduces distinctions across bonds. \n \nThe effect of migration on the individual bonds can be estimated in terms of \nyield to maturity. To make this estimation, we multiply the value of each bond in the \nperiod preceding downgrades 1 and 3 by coefficients 1b  and 3b  respectively.30 The result \ngives the change in the price of the bonds due to migration. We then subtract this amount \nfrom the price of the bond in the period preceding the downgrade and recalculate the yield \nto maturity using this new price. The difference between the yields in maturity is the \nestimate of the cost of migration in terms of basis points. The results of this exercise are \npresented in Table 8.  \n \n(Insert Table 8) \n \n \nOn average, the first migration cost about 106 basis points (bp) and the third about \n42 bp. However, for both downgrades the cost in yields varies from bond to bond. In fact, \n                                                 \n30 The second downgrade was not significant and therefore is not included in the estimation.  \n 27  \nbecause of the common migration effect, the cost is higher the shorter the maturity.31 This is \ntrue both within and across currencies and regardless of the coupon rate. The longer dollar \nand mark maturities have higher costs. The 5.25% yen issue, which matures in 21\/06\/93, \nhas a cost 10 bp higher than the 9.75% dollar issue maturing five months later. The 7% \nmark bond maturing four months before the 5.25% yen issue carries a cost of 23 bp above \nthe yen issue. This outcome suggests that bonds with shorter maturities are relatively more \nexposed to migration risk than those of longer maturities. \n \n \n6.Conclusions \n \nIn this paper we propose a methodology for measuring to what extent India\u2019s \nfinancial difficulties were the result of conditions prevailing on the international capital \nmarkets at the time, reflected in changes in the risk free international term structure of \ninterest rates, and to what extent they were linked to credit risk specific to the country\u2019s \npolitical environment and its economic and financial management as reflected in the \nthree ranking migrations. We find that most of the changes in Indian Eurobond prices \nover the period were due to conditions on the international capital markets. A 1% \nchange in the price of the theoretical bond caused about a 0.79% change in the price of \nthe Indian Eurobonds. The effect of credit risk specific to the country\u2019s political \nenvironment and its economic and financial management were relatively small. \nAveraging over all bonds, the first migration added about 106 basis points on to the \nbonds\u2019 yields to maturity while the third migration added about 42. The second \nmigration was very small and not statistically significant, indicating that it was \nanticipated by the markets and priced in the first downgrade.  \n                                                 \n31 This stands in contrast to the results of Elton et al. (2001), which suggest that this result does not apply \nto their selection of corporate bonds  \n 28  \n \nOur results are significant and robust. We find that the effect of migration on \nbond prices is not affected by currency, maturity or bond specific factors. Interestingly, \nhowever, shorter maturities are more sensitive to migration risk in that downward \nmigration increases yields to maturity for shorter maturities more than for longer \nmaturities.  \n 29  \nGraphs 1-8 \nRelationship Between Theoretical Prices, Actual Prices and LIBOR of \nSelected Indian Bonds \nNote: Arrows on horizontal time axis indicate downgradings on 4th October 1990, 26th \nMarch 1991 and 24th June 1991. \n \nIDBI, $, 10%, 6\/96\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\nJu\nn'9\n0\nSe\np'9\n0\nDe\nc'9\n0\nMa\nr'9\n1\nJu\nn'9\n1\nSe\np'9\n1\nDe\nc'9\n1\nMa\nr'9\n2\nJu\nn'9\n2\nSe\np'9\n2\nTheoretical price (% of\nface value)\nActual price (% of face\nvalue)\nLIBOR (%)\nONGC, $, 9.75%, 11\/93\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\nJu\nn'9\n0\nSe\np'9\n0\nDe\nc'9\n0\nMa\nr'9\n1\nJu\nn'9\n1\nSe\np'9\n1\nDe\nc'9\n1\nMa\nr'9\n2\nJu\nn'9\n2\nSe\np'9\n2\nTheoretical price (% of\nface value)\nActual price (% of face\nvalue)\nLIBOR (%)\n \n \n 30  \nONGC, $, 10%, 3\/97\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\nJu\nn'9\n0\nSe\np'9\n0\nDe\nc'9\n0\nMa\nr'9\n1\nJu\nn'9\n1\nSe\np'9\n1\nDe\nc'9\n1\nMa\nr'9\n2\nJu\nn'9\n2\nSe\np'9\n2\nTheoretical price (% of\nface value)\nActual price (% of face\nvalue)\nLIBOR (%)\nSBI, Yen, 5.25%, 6\/93\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\nJu\nn'9\n0\nSe\np'9\n0\nDe\nc'9\n0\nMa\nr'9\n1\nJu\nn'9\n1\nSe\np'9\n1\nDe\nc'9\n1\nMa\nr'9\n2\nJu\nn'9\n2\nSe\np'9\n2\nTheoretical price (% of face\nvalue)\nActual price (% of face value)\nLIBOR (%)\n \n 31  \n \n \n \n \nIDBI, DM, 6.375%, 12\/94\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\nJu\nn'9\n0\nSe\np'9\n0\nDe\nc'9\n0\nMa\nr'9\n1\nJu\nn'9\n1\nSe\np'9\n1\nDe\nc'9\n1\nMa\nr'9\n2\nJu\nn'9\n2\nSe\np'9\n2\nTheoretical price (% of\nface value)\nActual price (% of face\nvalue)\nLIBOR (%)\nIDBI, DM, 6.625%, 9\/95\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\nJu\nn'9\n0\nSe\np'9\n0\nDe\nc'9\n0\nMa\nr'9\n1\nJu\nn'9\n1\nSe\np'9\n1\nDe\nc'9\n1\nMa\nr'9\n2\nJu\nn'9\n2\nSe\np'9\n2\nTheoretical price (% of\nface value)\nActual price (% of face\nvalue)\nLIBOR (%)\n \n 32  \nIDBI, DM, 7%, 2\/93\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\nJu\nn'9\n0\nSe\np'9\n0\nDe\nc'9\n0\nMa\nr'9\n1\nJu\nn'9\n1\nSe\np'9\n1\nDe\nc'9\n1\nMa\nr'9\n2\nJu\nn'9\n2\nSe\np'9\n2\nTheoretical price (% of\nface value)\nActual price (% of face\nvalue)\nLIBOR (%)\nONGC, DM,6.375%, 2\/94\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\nJu\nn'9\n0\nSe\np'9\n0\nDe\nc'9\n0\nMa\nr'9\n1\nJu\nn'9\n1\nSe\np'9\n1\nDe\nc'9\n1\nMa\nr'9\n2\nJu\nn'9\n2\nSe\np'9\n2\nTheoretical price (% of\nface value)\nActual price (% of face\nvalue)\nLIBOR (%)\n \n  \n 1\n \n \nBIBLIOGRAPHY \n \n \nAronovich S.,  (1999), Country Risk Premium, Theoretical Determinants and Empirical Evidence \nFor Latin American Countries, Revista Brasiliera de Economia, Oct-Dec 1999, Vol. 53, No 4, 463-\n498 \n \nAltman E.I, (1998), The Importance and Subtlety of Credit Risk Migration, Journal of Banking and \nFinance, Vol. 22, Nos 10-11, 1231-47. \n \nAltman E.I and Saunders, A., (1998), Credit Risk Measurement: Developments over the Last 20 \nYears, Journal of Banking and Finance, Vol. 21, 1721-1742. \n \nBlack, F. and J.

Major Reforms And Liberalisation Measures Since 1991 \nFinancial \u2022 Banking system shedding its socio-political links and conducting its \nactivities more on the lines of viability and profitability.  \n\u2022 Misdirected investments and bad debts identified earlier and the \nStatutory Liquidity Ratio (the compulsory purchase of Government \nsecurities by the banking sector) reduced. \n\u2022 Credit on concessional terms to a multitude of priority areas laid down \ndismantled and the administered interest rate regime should be replaced \nby more market-determined rates.  \n\u2022 The financial sector building up its health by putting prudential capital-\nadequacy norms, increased provision for non-performing assets and \nstricter income and asset classification, leading to the ultimate adoption \nof accounting norms and practices in line with the international \ncommunity.  \n\u2022 Greater financial autonomy to banks and other financial enterprises, \npromoting competition amongst them and rapid induction of a work \nculture based on automation and computerization.  \nIndustrial \u2022 Delicensing paving the way for easy entry to industries, which were \nhitherto regulated.  \n\u2022 The Office of the Controller for Capital Issues, which used to formerly \ngrant permission for the floating of an issue in the market, was \nabolished in May 1992.  \n\u2022 The Monopolies and Trade Practices Act, which regulated the growth \nof the size of industry, has been changed drastically, to allow automatic \nclearance to companies expanding existing units or setting up new \nunits.  \n\u2022  Locational policies have been liberalized. \n\u2022 The role of the stock market has been strengthened by the introduction \nof several supervisory bodies overseen by Stock Exchange Board of \nIndia (SEBI) and an over the counter market is in operation. A National \nStock Exchange of India, connecting all the major exchanges \nelectronically is now in operation.  \n\u2022 The Convertibility clause, which allowed a financial institution which \nhad lent debt to an enterprise, convert its loans into equity and thus \nassume voting power has been repealed. \nPublic \nsector \n\u2022 Privatizatisation by the reduction in the list of industries reserved for \nthe public sector and the divestment of shares, \n\u2022 The policy of treating sick public sector units in line with such private \nsector units \n\u2022 Allowing managers greater autonomy. \n\u2022 Introduction of selective competition in the reserved area \nFiscal \nPolicy \n\u2022 Lower rates of taxation \n\u2022 Narrower spread between the entry rate and the maximum marginal rate\n\u2022 Fewer exemptions and deductions. \n\u2022 The indirect taxation system was also to be cut  \n\u2022 Simplification in areas of capital, corporate, wealth, income and \nindirect taxes. \n 6\n \n \n \n 7\n Table 1.
