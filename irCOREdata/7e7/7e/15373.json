We show theoretically that\nthe regime of strong coupling between cavity polaritons and Tamm surface plasmons is possible in\nsuch structures. The effect is favorable for the spatial confinement of polaritons and the formation\nof hybrid one-dimensional plasmon-polariton modes. \u00a9 2009 American Institute of Physics.\n\u0003doi:10.1063\/1.3266841\u0004\nExciton polaritons in semiconductor microcavities1 are\nextremely promising for various optoelectronic applications\nincluding polariton lasers,2 light emitting diodes,3 and optical\nparametric oscillators.4 Being mixed light-matter quasiparti-\ncles, exciton polaritons can retain coherence when ballisti-\ncally propagating over several hundreds of microns in planar\nmicrocavities,5 which in principle makes possible their use in\nlogic elements, such as \u201cpolariton neurons,\u201d6 based on the\ntransport of spin or optical polarization over macroscopic\ndistances. However, the realization of exciton-polariton inte-\ngrated circuits based on a network of polariton neurons\nlinked by logic gates with different geometries requires the\ncreation in the plane of a microcavity of channels that are\nsuitable for guiding the polaritons in the required directions.\nSuch channels can be produced by etching the cavity\nheterostructures,6 but a less demanding process would be\npreferred. A more straightforward approach is the deposition\nof metallic mesas on the surface of the semiconductor\nstructure,7,8 and this has been used to create lateral superlat-\ntices for exciton polaritons7 resulting in potential barriers\nwith a height of about 200 \u0001eV. However, for the develop-\nment of the next generation of polaritonic devices, including\npolaritonic logic devices, it is necessary to have practical\ntechniques for the creation of potential barriers of the order\nof a few meV. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate theo-\nretically that it is possible to use the resonant coupling of\nexciton polaritons and another type of excitation called a\nTamm surface plasmon \u0001TSP\u0002 \u0001Ref. 9 and 10\u0002 to produce\nstructures that provide a sufficiently large lateral modulation\nof the energy profile of exciton polaritons. Note that recently\nstrong coupling of Tamm plasmon and quantum well \u0001QW\u0002\nexcitons has been demonstrated experimentally.11\nAs with conventional surface plasmons,12 TSPs can be\nstrongly coupled to the optical cavity modes as we show\nhere. The resonant coupling of the TSPs to cavity exciton\npolaritons results in the appearance of hybrid plasmon-\nexciton-polariton modes forming a characteristic triplet.\nIn this paper we consider the eigenstates of a laterally\nhomogeneous structure of the type shown in Fig. 1. The\nsame semiconductor is used for the layer adjacent to the\nmetal, one type of DBR layer and the cavity \u0001apart from the\nQW\u0002, and is taken to have a refractive index nA which is\ngreater than the value nB for the other semiconductor used in\nthe DBR. The choice nA\u0002nB is a necessary condition for the\nstructure to support TSPs,9 and a consequence is that there is\nzero phase change on reflection at the edges of the microcav-\nity, and hence a cavity length of one wavelength is appropri-\nate if there is to be an antinode in the electric field at the QW.\nA convenient and effective approach is the coupled os-\ncillator model, the hybrid system considered here can be\nconveniently represented as three coupled oscillators. In par-\nticular, the eigenenergies of the system can be found by solv-\ning the equation\n\u0005\u0003 \u2212 \u0003C \u0004C\u2212X \u0004C\u2212TP\u0004C\u2212X \u0003 \u2212 \u0003X 0\n\u0004C\u2212TP 0 \u0003 \u2212 \u0003TP\n\u0005 = 0, \u00011\u0002\nwhere \u0003TP, \u0003C, and \u0003X are the eigenfrequencies of the TSP,\nthe bare cavity mode, and the exciton, respectively, while\n\u0004C\u2212X and \u0004C\u2212TP characterize the coupling strengths of the\ncavity mode with the exciton and the TSP, respectively.\nThe value of \u0004C\u2212X is well known from the literature\n\u0001e.g., Refs. 1, 13, and 14\u0002 as\na\u0002Electronic mail: iorsh86@yandex.ru.\nFIG. 1. \u0001Color online\u0002 A schematic diagram of the type of structure that is\nsuitable for the observation of hybrid Tamm plasmon-exciton-polariton\nstates.

The envelope\nof the hybrid mode exhibits two maxima, which are located\nat the metal-DBR interface and at the center of the cavity.\nIf the cavity contains a QW, the coupling of the cavity\nphoton mode, Tamm plasmon, and QW exciton leads to the\nformation of a hybrid Tamm plasmon-exciton-polariton state.\nFigure 3 shows the complex eigenenergies of the hybrid\nFIG. 2. \u0001Color online\u0002 The profiles of the electric field squared and the\nrefractive index for \u0001a\u0002 the TSP localized at the interface between a 50 nm\ngold film and a Bragg reflector with complex energy 1.550 485\n\u22120.001 099 731i eV, \u0001b\u0002 the microcavity photon mode localized between\ntwo Bragg reflectors with energy 1.550 182\u22120.000 173 341 9i eV, and \u0001c\u0002\nthe lowest energy coupled state of the Tamm plasmon and the microcavity\nphoton mode with energy 1.546 08\u22120.000 468 495 7i eV.

In both figures the curves exhibit double\nanticrossings characteristic of the strong coupling regime in\na system of three oscillators. Therefore, to achieve a reason-\nably long lifetime for the hybrid state, the thickness of the\ngold layer should be not less than 50 nm. The offset \u000b of the\nhybrid state with respect to the cavity polariton state for the\nchosen set of parameters, is indicated by the horizontal\ndashed lines in Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002 and has a value of 1.7 meV, which\nis sufficient to realize in-plane localization. The correspond-\ning value of \u000b predicted by the algebraic theory \u0003Eq. \u000111\u0002\u0004 is\n1.85 meV, in good agreement with the numerical result.\nThe in-plane modulation of the energy of the lowest state\nachieved with the resonant coupling of the Tamm plasmons\nand cavity polaritons, as considered here, is one order of\nmagnitude larger than with nonresonant modulation of the\nenergy of the cavity polariton using a metal film.7,8 In other\nwords, the deposition of a metal film on the top of a QW\nmicrocavity facilitates the lateral localization of exciton po-\nlaritons in a microcavity and opens the way for a practical\ndemonstration of polaritonic logic gates.16,17 Figure 4 shows\nthe dispersion of hybrid modes which shows double anti-\ncrossing behavior. The masses of bare exciton, cavity mode\nand Tamm Plasmon are shown in Table I.\nIn conclusion, the resonant coupling of Tamm plasmons\nwith cavity exciton polaritons results in the formation of hy-\nbrid excitations and provides a potential mechanism for the\nlateral confinement of the lowest energy eigenmode of the\nsystem. Specifically, directed in-plane propagation of exciton\npolaritons in planar microcavities can be achieved by the\ndeposition of metallic mesa structures on the top of the semi-\nconductor structure.\nThis work has been supported by the EU IRSES project\nPOLALAS.

The vertical bars give the imaginary parts of the eigenen-\nergies. The offset \u000b of the hybrid state with respect to the cavity polariton\nstate is indicated by the horizontal dashed lines. The parameters of the\nstructure are the same as for Fig. 2\u0001c\u0002 but there are four QWs in the cavity\nin this case. The QW exciton oscillator strength is taken as 0.026 meV.\nFIG. 4. \u0001Color online\u0002 The in-plane dispersion curves of the hybrid Tamm-\nplasmon-exciton-polariton modes.
