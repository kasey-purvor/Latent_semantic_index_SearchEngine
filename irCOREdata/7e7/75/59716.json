Introduction\nIce shelves around the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) have shown progressive and ongoing retreat in11\nrecent decades that is widely believed to be associated with rapid atmospheric warming [Vaughan12\nand Doake, 1996]. West of the AP, air and ocean temperatures are relatively high and few ice-shelf13\nfragments remain, while on the eastern side both are lower and much of Larsen Ice Shelf (LIS) is14\nstill present. However, collapses of Larsen A Ice Shelf in 1995 and Larsen B Ice Shelf (LBIS) in15\n2002 have led to concern over the stability of the larger Larsen C Ice Shelf (LCIS). Such collapses16\nhave little direct effect on sea level, but the accompanying reduced buttressing of inshore glaciers17\nled to increased ice discharge and sea-level rise [Rignot et al., 2004].18\nIn addition to atmospheric effects, it is argued that LIS has been thinned by increased ocean19\nmelting [Shepherd et al., 2003], possibly linked to Weddell Deep Water (WDW) warming in re-20\ncovery from the 1970s Weddell Polynya [Robertson et al., 2002]. Nicholls et al. [2004] observed21\nModified Weddell Deep Water (MWDW) and Ice Shelf Water (ISW; below the surface freezing22\npoint and thus laced with ice-shelf meltwater) at the northern end of LCIS and deduced that the23\nISW was derived from MWDW cooled to the surface freezing point by interaction with the atmo-24\nsphere. If waters flushing LCIS cavity are universally constrained to the surface freezing point,25\nWDW warming could not thin LCIS.26\nThe ocean may freeze onto ice shelves as well as melting them, and there is reason to expect27\nthat this occurs beneath LIS. Water at the surface freezing point melts ice shelves because the28\nfreezing temperature decreases with pressure, and resulting meltwater generates a thermohaline29\ncirculation in which cold, buoyant, ascending currents may become supercooled and form marine30\nice on the base of the ice shelf [Robin, 1979]. Other processes can also form marine ice [Vaughan31\net al., 1993; Rignot and MacAyeal , 1998]. We utilized airborne radio-echo sounding (RES) data,32\nsatellite visible imagery, and an ocean model to assess the evidence for, and effect of, marine ice33\nin LIS.34\n2. Survey data\nWe analyzed data from the 1997\u20131998 British Antarctic Survey\u2013Instituto Anta\u00b4rtico Argentino35\nairborne RES survey (\u20189798\u2019 data), seeking evidence of marine ice and ice drafts for the ocean36\nmodel. The survey used differential GPS and a radar transmitting a conventional 0.25-\u00b5s pulse37\naround 150 MHz. Missions were flown with a nominal 150-m terrain clearance and ice thickness38\nwas derived using an 168-m \u00b5s\u22121 wave-velocity and 10-m firn correction. Position was determined39\nto < 0.5 m and crossover analysis yielded RMS differences of 12 m ice thickness and 4 m elevation.40\nFigure 1 shows near-continuous 9798 RES surface returns, but basal returns are missing in41\nopen rifts and (shaded) flow bands in the wake of promontories and islands; we hypothesize that42\nmarine ice causes the latter. Marine ice basal returns are rarely detectable because it has high43\ndielectric absorption [Thyssen, 1988] and can form an unconsolidated, diffuse base [Engelhardt44\nand Determann, 1987]. Meteoric\u2013marine ice interfaces are more commonly detected, but no such45\nsignal occurs in the 9798 data, perhaps because the radar was optimized for thicker ice. Thus, we46\ncould not derive marine ice thickness from isostatic anomaly (e.g. Fricker et al. [2001], who also47\nhad some missing returns over marine ice).48\nIn LCIS, visible imagery supports a marine origin of these flow bands (Figure 1). First, they49\nare smooth when, situated between glacier flow units, they might be heavily crevassed by shear.50\nSecond, other flow units contain rifts whose lateral propagation is clearly limited by the marine51\nbands; this process governs iceberg-calving and ice-front geometry. There are several reasons52\nwhy such behavior implies marine ice: oceanic freezing increases mean ice-shelf temperature and53\nthus decreases its viscosity [Larour et al., 2005]; ice\u2019s critical crevassing strain-rate decreases54\nwith temperature [Vaughan, 1993], so warm marine ice will increasingly deform rather than fail55\nin response to stress; and marine ice heals rifts, binding their edges together with deformable56\nmaterial [Rignot and MacAyeal , 1998].57\nIce draft (Figure 2) was obtained by combining 9798 basal elevations with older BEDMAP ice58\nthicknesses [Lythe et al., 2001] using a 9798 thickness\u2013elevation relation (also used to fill missing59\nbasal returns). Latitude-dependence improved the relation (significance level \u00bf 1 %), so we used60\nh = \u2212274.5 + 0.10D \u2212 4.22\u03c6, where h,D, and \u03c6 are surface elevation, ice thickness, and latitude.61\nWe attribute the northward-decreasing intercept in this relation to firn compaction as a result of62\nhigher air temperatures [Vaughan and Doake, 1996]. If this spatial correlation implies a temporal63\nfirn depth\u2013temperature linkage, recent warming may have caused firn compaction that contributed64\nto LIS surface lowering [Shepherd et al., 2003]. Drafts outside our area of interest were filled using65\nthe 9798 relation and an elevation dataset [Liu et al., 2001] and the final data were adjusted to the66\nEIGEN-GL04C geoid [Fo\u00a8rste et al., 2008] and smoothed for model stability [Holland and Feltham,67\n2006]. The eastern boundary approximately follows the LCIS ice front, including most of LBIS68\nand easing the implementation of model boundary conditions.69\nInferred marine bands emanate from \u2018source\u2019 regions thinned by ice flow divergence from stag-70\nnant promontories (Figure 2). This provides at least three candidate formation mechanisms,71\nproducing different types of marine ice that we cannot differentiate: a) \u2018sea ice\u2019, formation of72\nsaline ice me\u00b4lange in rifts. This grows at the rate of landfast sea ice with additional basal freezing73\n[Khazendar and Jenkins , 2003] and occurs in rifted source regions in LBIS [Glasser and Scambos ,74\n2008] that are absent in LCIS (Figure 1). b) \u2018flooding\u2019, seawater infiltration of firn. Wilkins Ice75\nShelf firn floods when it is depressed below sea level before pore close-off [Vaughan et al., 1993],76\nprobably generating marine ice at the surface accumulation rate. LIS sources are similar: near-77\nstagnant ice, 100\u2013200 m thick, with 10\u201350 cm a\u22121 water-equivalent accumulation [Turner et al.,78\n2002]. c) \u2018oceanic\u2019 basal freezing. Ice-shelf basal melting commonly peaks near deep-drafted79\nglacier inflows, and rising buoyant meltwater may supercool due to its increasing in-situ freezing80\ntemperature [Robin, 1979], freezing onto the ice base and growing and depositing frazil ice crys-81\ntals. However, Coriolis force causes meltwater to flow geostrophically across-slope, so the primary82\nconstraints forcing it to ascend and supercool are grounded-ice barriers perpendicular to draft83\ncontours [Holland and Feltham, 2006]. Therefore, in general the most favorable oceanic freezing84\nlocations are the marine ice sources observed here, basal \u2018hollows\u2019 (ice-draft minima) downstream85\nof deep inflows bounded to the left by grounded ice [e.g Fricker et al., 2001]. Oceanic freezing rates86\nvary depending upon local conditions, so we modeled ocean properties to assess freezing beneath87\nLIS.88\n3. Model\nA two-dimensional (depth-averaged) plume model [Holland and Feltham, 2006] was used to89\ninvestigate LIS, representing buoyancy-driven meltwater flow but neglecting other important pro-90\ncesses such as tides and water-column thickness variations. The model represents marine ice91\naccretion in detail, simulating direct basal melting and freezing and the growth and deposition of92\nfrazil ice over 10 size classes. At 1-km resolution (10-s timestep), it resolves draft features and93\nfrazil dynamics relatively well.94\nPlume parameters used by Payne et al. [2007] and frazil settings of Holland et al. [2007] were95\nunchanged except for the entrainment coefficient (see below) and latitude 67\u25e6S. The plume evolves96\nto steady state from fixed-property inflow regions [Payne et al., 2007] placed wherever draft exceeds97\n1000 m (400 m) beneath LCIS (LBIS). A uniform ambient ocean surrounds the active plume.98\nFrom the observed LCIS outflow and simple theory, Nicholls et al. [2004] infer that the cavity99\ncontains MWDW at surface freezing temperature, so our basic \u2018cool\u2019 case used an ambient with100\npotential temperature -1.9 \u25e6C, salinity 34.65. We also ran an extreme \u2018warm\u2019 case at -1.4 \u25e6C,101\n34.57, properties of the warmest MWDW adjacent to LIS [Nicholls et al., 2004].102\nAfter 240 days, the steady cool-case results feature a thick meltwater layer sourced in rapidly-103\nmelting deep regions near the grounding line and flowing geostrophically along draft contours104\n(Figure 3a). The plume thickens in basal hollows because meltwater fills them before spilling105\nupwards over their sides. Under LCIS, meltwater from the whole grounding line combines into a106\ncentral plume that flows along-slope until it is deflected out of the cavity by Jason Peninsula. This107\ncurrent reflects the entire LCIS system, so we tuned the entrainment coefficient to match obser-108\nvations of its \u2248 200-m thick outflow with potential temperature -2.1 \u25e6C, salinity 34.55 [Nicholls109\net al., 2004]. Melt and freeze patterns were insensitive to this parameter, whose final value of110\n2\u00d7 10\u22123 is within the range tested previously [Holland and Feltham, 2006; Payne et al., 2007].111\nGenerally weak melting (Figure 3b) peaks below deep glaciers, which have steep bases (hence112\nrapid currents and high turbulent heat flux) and large thermal driving (freezing temperature113\ndecreases with depth). Marine ice accumulates in the larger hollows named in Figure 1, suggesting114\nthat oceanic freezing is a primary source of marine ice advected downstream by the ice. Meltwater115\nis constrained to ascend into these hollows (and supercool) by grounded ice to its left. Vigorous116\nfrazil deposition causes high accumulation near Churchill Peninsula, in agreement with the broad117\nmarine band in Figure 1, which arises from the confluence of the central geostrophic plume and118\nboundary-trapped meltwater from the south.119\nPredicted LBIS freezing agrees with Figure 1, but the applicability to LBIS of the ambient ocean120\nforcing is uncertain and its marine ice could be entirely me\u00b4lange. Oceanic freezing might contribute121\nmarine ice to the LCIS rifts near Jason and Kenyon peninsulas but their processes are inaccurately122\nmodeled here. Elsewhere beneath LCIS, freezing rates are apparently comparable to flooding (<123\n0.2 m a\u22121), apart from near Churchill Peninsula, but this is probably an underestimation. In124\ngeneral application the model predicts direct freezing (order 0.1 m a\u22121), wherever the ice base125\nis supercooled, surrounding focused frazil deposition (order 1 m a\u22121), where the plume is depth-126\naverage supercooled; the latter is a smaller area because the freezing temperature decreases with127\ndepth [Holland and Feltham, 2006]. The plume is depth-average supercooled only off Churchill128\nPeninsula, so other regions experience only direct freezing; part of the plume is supercooled and129\nshould grow frazil, but our depth-averaged model cannot resolve this. Three-dimensional models130\nrequire considerable resources to run at frazil-resolving temporal and spatial resolution, and despite131\nits simplicity our model demonstrates consistency between freezing locations and observed ocean132\nconditions.133\nIn the warm case (temperature increased by 0.5 \u25e6C) melting remains generally weak (Figure134\n3c), but high melting near grounding lines increases in extent and rate. Freezing halts everywhere135\napart from Churchill Peninsula, where a reduction occurs as frazil deposition ceases. Freezing is136\nbolstered south of Jason Peninsula by increased volumes of meltwater from upstream. Cool and137\nwarm cases have mean LIS melt rates of 0.27 m a\u22121 (15.1 Gt a\u22121) and 1.26 m a\u22121 (69.5 Gt a\u22121)138\nrespectively, revealing a low sensitivity to temperature change (2 m a\u22121 \u25e6C\u22121) that fits the theory139\nthat ice shelves forced by cooler waters are less susceptible to warming [Holland et al., 2008]. Melt140\nrates reflect our idealized model and are not best estimates; Rignot et al. [2008] estimate that the141\nnorthern AP discharged 20 \u00b1 3 and 49 \u00b1 3 Gt a\u22121 in 1996 and 2006 respectively.142\n4. Discussion\nIt is informative to consider earlier studies of LBIS, which inferred weak ice downstream of Foyn143\nPoint and Cape Disappointment [Vieli et al., 2006; Khazendar et al., 2007]. These were rifted144\n\u2018suture zones\u2019, and their weakening could have contributed to LBIS collapse [Glasser and Scambos ,145\n2008]. Ice me\u00b4lange formed in these rifts comprised the marine ice that we observe downstream,146\nconfirming earlier speculation [Khazendar et al., 2007]. Rifts lessened downstream, suggesting that147\nthey were absent in the past [Glasser and Scambos , 2008] or are healed by compression [Vieli et al.,148\n2006]; we suggest that our inferred marine bands and modeled freezing are also consistent with149\nhealing by marine ice. It is possible that climatic change reduced marine ice formation, weakening150\nsutures between flow units and contributing to LBIS collapse. Beneath LCIS, marine ice limits151\nrifts and appears to bind flow units together, so an understanding of its effect is necessary to assess152\nthe future of LIS. Marine-ice mechanisms could stabilize ice shelves in the cool waters east of the153\nAP, but will be reduced in warmer conditions to its west.154\nSea-ice formation in rifts will respond to changes in almost any climatic variable, while marine155\nice formation by flooding would be affected by the increasing accumulation near LIS [Thomas156\net al., 2008]. Oceanic freezing will reduce if warmer waters access the cavity, providing a link157\nbetween LCIS stability and Weddell Sea conditions that is more complex than a simple melting\u2013158\ntemperature relationship. Our model suggests that the outflow observed by Nicholls et al. [2004]159\nderives from the whole ice shelf, so their deduction that cool MWDW drives melting, rather160\nthan warming WDW, applies universally rather than just in the vicinity of their measurements.161\nAll cavity waters are therefore sourced at the surface freezing temperature, so a warming would162\nrequire either weaker modification of the MWDW entering the cavity (reduced continental-shelf163\nsea ice formation) or an increased supply of warm off-shelf MWDW (changed ocean circulation).164\nWind-forced changes of the latter type are thought to affect ice shelves in the Amundsen Sea165\n[Thoma et al., 2008]. The pattern of LIS elevation change attributed to increased basal melting166\n[Shepherd et al., 2003] apparently requires warming focused on the north of the cavity rather than167\nthe uniform warming modeled here.168\n5. Conclusions\nAirborne RES data, satellite visible imagery, and a simple ocean model lead us to the following169\nconclusions:170\n1. LIS contains flow bands comprised of marine ice, which is advected downstream by ice flow171\nafter forming in thin areas between glacier flow units in the immediate wake of peninsulas. This172\nis consistent with previously inferred LBIS rheologies.173\n2. Different types of marine ice, which we cannot distinguish, could be formed by ocean freezing,174\nsea ice formation in rifts, and seawater-flooded firn. The model indicates that rising meltwater175\ncauses significant oceanic freezing beneath LIS. Visible imagery suggests that sea-ice formation176\nin rifts occurred only in LBIS at the time of survey. Flooding could generate marine ice at the177\nsurface accumulation rate and cannot be ruled out.178\n3. Marine ice laterally limits rifts formed in LCIS meteoric flow units and thereby controls179\niceberg calving and ice-front geometry. Warm marine ice has a low viscosity and can deform180\nrapidly without fracturing, and oceanic freezing heals rifted meteoric ice. Marine ice could thus181\nreduce the likelihood of LCIS collapse. Failure of marine bands was implicated in the LBIS182\ncollapse.183\n4. A LCIS cavity filled with warmer water would experience greater melting and less-widespread184\nfreezing. The model suggests that MWDW melts LCIS, so such a change could arise through185\nreduced cooling of MWDW over the continental shelf or an increased supply of warmer MWDW186\nonto the shelf. The observed WDW warming probably cannot affect LCIS.187\nIn-situ survey, ice-coring, and improved ocean modeling and observation are now necessary to188\nconfirm the origin and properties of LIS marine ice.189\nReferences\nADD Consortium (2002), Antarctic Digital Database, SCAR, Cambridge,\nhttp:\/\/www.add.scar.org\/.\nEngelhardt, H., and J.
