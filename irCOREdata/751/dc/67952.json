We considered the possibility that the events could be\ncaused by lightning noise breakthrough. The association of the noise burst events with\nlocal midnight and high geomagnetic activity argues against a lightning link, as well as the\nlack of close thunderstorm location relative to Sodankyl\u00e4 during noise periods. While\nenergetic electron precipitation is also associated with high geomagnetic activity, we\nshowed that they occur at different times and exhibit significantly different amplitude\ncharacteristics. Finally, we compared in detail the geomagnetic induced current (GIC) in\nthe Scottish power system in southern Scotland, during a storm event that occurred on\n15 May 2005, with the noise burst event rate at Sodankyl\u00e4. We found that the onset time\nand variability of the Scottish GIC activity was well matched by the variability in the noise\nburst event rate, particularly the high\u2010frequency component of the GIC fluctuations.\nThe technique used in our study of observing at a narrow band of frequencies allows GIC\nmeasurements to be made in built\u2010up areas where mains interference is a problem for\nother experiments, such as magnetometers.\nCitation: Clilverd, M.

Introduction\n[2] Very low frequency (VLF) observing systems have\nbeen used at high latitudes for many years [Barr et al.,\n2000] particularly to monitor waves that have propagated\nto the ground from space, such as whistlers, chorus waves,\ntriggered emissions [Helliwell, 1965], waves from lightning\ndischarges [e.g., Dowden et al., 2008], and also to monitor\nenergetic particle precipitation through effects on radio\nwave subionospheric propagation [e.g., Clilverd et al.,\n2009]. In this study we analyze radio signals recorded at\n20\u201325 kHz in the high\u2010latitude northern hemisphere using\nan experiment intended to monitor man\u2010made radio wave\ntransmissions. We show that on occasions when strong\nman\u2010made radio transmissions are not present, large noise\nspikes can be observed, which are associated with high\ngeomagnetic activity. We discuss the mechanism that\nproduces these features, particularly in terms of either\nlightning generated noise, energetic electron precipitation,\nor local electromagnetically induced currents.\n[3] Short\u2010duration waves like chorus and triggered\nemissions can be strong, but are typically restricted to\nfrequencies < 15 kHz [Helliwell, 1965] and are thus not\nconsidered as a significant noise source in the 20\u201325 kHz\n1Physical Sciences Division, British Antarctic Survey, Natural\nEnvironment Research Council, Cambridge, U.K.\n2Department of Physics, University of Otago, Dunedin, New\nZealand.\n3Sodankyla\u00a8 Geophysical Observatory, University of Oulu,\nSodankyl\u00e4, Finland.\n4Global Seismology andGeomagnetismGroup,British Geological\nSurvey, Natural Environment Research Council, Edinburgh, U.K.\n5Space Plasma Environment and Radio Science Group, InfoLab\n21, Department of Communication Systems, Lancaster University,\nLancaster, U.K.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0048\u20106604\/10\/2009RS004215\nRADIO SCIENCE, VOL. 45, RS2006, doi:10.1029\/2009RS004215, 2010\nRS2006 1 of 11\nrange investigated here. Auroral hiss bursts can produce\nstrong emissions in the 20\u201325 kHz frequency range, but\nthese have not been observed to be intense enough, nor\nof short enough duration, to be categorized as large noise\nspikes as we define them later in this study (T. Turunen,\npersonal communication, 2010). However, lightning gen-\nerated noise bursts known as \u201catmospherics\u201d or \u201csferics\u201d\n[Rakov and Uman, 2006] are a significant noise source in\nthe 20\u201325 kHz range. While lightning tends to occur more\noften at low latitudes than at high latitudes [Christian et\nal., 2003], the signals can propagate long distances in\nthe subionospheric waveguide and so we consider their\neffect further in this paper as a potential mechanism to\nexplain large noise spikes observed in our narrowband\nreceivers.\n[4] The precipitation of energetic electrons into the\nD region can occur in bursts and be observed from\nballoon\u2010borne experiments, as well as through their effect\non subionospheric propagation. Relativistic Electron Pre-\ncipitation (REP) into the atmosphere has been observed to\ntake several forms. Relativistic microbursts observed from\nthe SAMPEX satellite last less than 1 s, occur at about\nL = 4\u20136, are observed predominantly in the morning\nsector, and have been associated with VLF chorus waves\n[Nakamura et al., 2000; Lorentzen et al., 2001]. Precipi-\ntation events lasting minutes to hours have been observed\nfrom the MAXIS balloon. They occur at about L = 4\u20137,\nare observed in the late afternoon\/dusk sector, and may\nbe produced by EMIC waves [Millan et al., 2002; Rodger\net al., 2008]. Both of these types of precipitation can occur\nat the same time during geomagnetic storms, as observed\nby Clilverd et al. [2006] and Rodger et al. [2007] during\nthe large electron flux decrease event of 21 January 2005.\n[5] During geomagnetic storms the modification of\nionospheric currents can produce telluric currents that\nare correlated with sudden changes in magnetometer\nrecordings. Geomagnetic storms cause large currents to\nflow in the ionosphere, which in turn induce geomagnet-\nically induced currents (GICs) in electric power systems\n[Thomson et al., 2005]. The GICs result in severe half\u2010\ncycle saturation and increased demands on transformers\nthrough increased leakage fluxes. GICs have caused\nunusual noises and heating in transformers, real and\nreactive power swings, voltage fluctuations, the operation\nor nonoperation of protective relays, and other similar\neffects [Pulkkinen et al., 2005; Pirjola, 2007]. The effects\ncan be long lasting (hours) but changeable over only a few\nseconds depending on the variability of the ionospheric\ncurrents. GIC effects on VLF systems have been observed\nin the form of increases in the intensity of power line\nharmonics in the frequency range 180\u2013720 Hz [Hayashi et\nal., 1978]. The cause was attributed to induced currents\nover loading a power supply near to the VLF observation\nsite, during a sudden storm commencement. Hayashi et al.\nsuggested that suitably distributed VLF receivers would\nbe expected to be useful for monitoring GIC in power\nsystems.\n[6] In this study we report for the first time unusual\nnoise events observed on narrowband VLF recordings in\nthe frequency range 20\u201325 kHz. We analyze data from\nSodankyl\u00e4, Finland, from 1 January to 30 April 2005 in\norder to compare the noise events with other features in\nthe radio wave data, such as lightning noise, and pertur-\nbations due to the precipitation of energetic electrons. We\nalso compare the response of the VLF receivers to geo-\nmagnetically induced currents observed in a power system\nin Scotland during a large geomagnetic storm. Wideband\nspectrograms (1\u201330 kHz) would have helped distinguish\nbetween these mechanisms, particularly as they show\nbroadband noise well, and electron precipitation effects\npoorly. However, wideband recordings were not available\nduring the period studied here. Even so, we show that\ngeomagnetically induced currents are the most likely\nexplanation for the observed noise events, and that they\ncould be induced in the VLF receiver itself or in nearby\npower systems; making the instrument a simple, real\u2010time,\ncheap, and portable monitor of these potentially disruptive\nionospheric currents.\n2. Experimental Setup\n[7] We use high time resolution, narrowband sub-\nionospheric VLF data spanning 20\u201325 kHz received at\ntwo sites: Sodankyl\u00e4, Finland (67\u00b0N, 23\u00b0E, L = 5.2); and\nNy \u00c5lesund, Svalbard (79\u00b0N, 11\u00b0E, L = 18.3). These sites\nare part of the Antarctic\u2010Arctic Radiation\u2010belt Dynamic\nDeposition VLF Atmospheric Research Konsortia:\nAARDDVARK [Clilverd et al., 2009]. The data shown in\nthis study are taken from 1 January to 30 April 2005,\nwhich includes several periods of high geomagnetic\nactivity and good quality data from both sites. Figure 1\nshows the location of the receiver sites (diamonds), and the\ntransmitter\u2010receiver paths that are under study (transmitter\nlocations are given by the circles).\n[8] The receiver at Sodankyl\u00e4 (SGO) records data at\n0.1 s resolution, while the receiver at Ny \u00c5lesund records\nat 1.25 s resolution. Most of the data used in this study is\nfrom SGO because of the high time resolution required to\nstudy burst events. The aerials used in both cases are\nmagnetic loops and thus directional. We study data from\nthe transmitter frequencies logged when the signals from\nthe transmitters are either off or nulled by the direction-\nality of the aerial to very low amplitudes.\n[9] Supporting data from Kilpisj\u00e4rvi, Finland (69.02\u00b0N,\n20.86\u00b0E, L = 6.1), are taken from the central beam (beam\n25) of the Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies\n(IRIS) [Browne et al., 1995], which operates at 38.2 MHz.\nThe riometer measures the relative opacity of the atmo-\nsphere, and generates a data set of the variation of the\nabsorption of 38.2 MHz radio waves, which can be\nCLILVERD ET AL.: GEOMAGNETIC NOISE BURSTS RS2006RS2006\n2 of 11\ninterpreted as a measure of the additional ionization pro-\nduced by precipitating energetic particles, such as 30\u2013\n200 keV electrons.\n3. Results\n[10] The experimental setup at SGOmeans that the great\ncircle path of the transmitter in Hawaii (NPM, 21.4 kHz)\npasses through the high\u2010latitude region of the northern\nhemisphere (Figure 1). However, the magnetic loop aerial\norientation used at SGO has been optimized to monitor\nthe nearer transmitters in Europe, such that the Hawaii\nsignal is very weak. Figure 2 shows the amplitude of\nNPM during 21 January 2005. The amplitude of NPM\nis typically close to the natural noise levels defined by\nlightning atmospherics, i.e., about 30\u201335 dB in Figure 2,\nand shows some slowly varying behavior associated with\nthe diurnal variation in lightning activity. During this day\nrecovery is occurring from the solar proton event that\nbegan at 0700 UT on 20 January 2005 but this does not\ninfluence the data shown in Figure 2. At 1710 UT a\ncoronal mass ejection hit the Earth [Clilverd et al., 2006]\nand at this time large noise burst events (NBEs) can be\nobserved on the NPM signal. The noise bursts are\ntypically > 15 dB higher than the background levels, i.e.,\nwith quasi\u2010constant peak amplitudes \u223c50 dB, and continue\nuntil the end of the day. During this period, Kp > 8. Some\nother periods of burst events are also observed before\n1710 UT, especially at the beginning of the day just after\n0000 UT, although they are relatively few in number.\n[11] Figure 3 is a close\u2010up of one of the NBEs that\noccurred just after 1715 UT. Figure 3 shows the ampli-\ntude and phase changes during the burst event. Vertical\ndotted lines indicate the start and end of the event, which\nhas a total duration of 4.5 s. Some structure can be seen\nin the event, although it is primarily one of a sudden\nincrease in amplitude, followed by a gradual recovery.\nThese characteristics are typical of the noise burst events\nseen in the Sodankyl\u00e4 data, e.g., sudden large positive\nincreases in amplitude with an accompanying advance in\nphase.\n[12] Due to the quasi\u2010constant peak amplitude of\nNBEs we are able to use a simple threshold detection\nalgorithm to determine the number of NBEs for each hour\nduring the period 1 January to 31 April 2005. The\nthreshold was set at 50 dB. Figure 4 shows the time var-\niation of the number of NBEs per hour averaged over\n3 h during the period of study, and shows a comparison\nwith the 3\u2010hourly geomagnetic ap index. Vertical dashed\nlines are plotted on Figure 4 to indicate the start of periods\nof high geomagnetic activity. A data gap occurred from\n5 to 11 January 2005 in the VLF recordings, which\nexplains why a period of high geomagnetic activity on\n7 January 2005 does not appear to correlate with high\nNBE occurrence. For the rest of the study period there\nis a high correlation between the occurrence of NBEs\nand increased geomagnetic activity.\n[13] The diurnal variation of the occurrence of NBEs\nper hour from 1 January to 31 April 2005 is shown in\nFigure 5. The occurrence of NBEs varies reasonably\nsmoothly throughout the day. The occurrence rate is near\nFigure 2.

We\ndiscuss the possible significance of the diurnal variation of\nNBEs in section 3.3.\n3.1. Comparison With Lightning Noise Bursts\n[14] As the power spectral density of lightning peaks in\nthe VLF spectral band [Pierce, 1977], it may be possible\nfor lightning to interfere with Sodankyl\u00e4\u2019s VLF data by\n\u201cbreaking through\u201d into the narrowband observations.\nWhen comparing data from the World Wide Lightning\nFigure 3.

The length\nof time between the vertical dashed lines is 4.5 s.\nCLILVERD ET AL.: GEOMAGNETIC NOISE BURSTS RS2006RS2006\n4 of 11\nLocation Network (WWLLN [Dowden et al., 2008;\nRodger et al., 2009]) for January\u2013July 2005 inclusive, to\nsearch for periods of lightning activity near Sodankyl\u00e4, it\nwas found that only two lightning storms coincided with\nperiods of VLF signal perturbation, and both were later\nin the year than April 2005. WWLLN locations used in\nthe present study were produced by the original lighting\nlocation algorithm [Rodger et al., 2006]. The WWLLN\nhas low lightning stroke detection efficiency, detecting\nonly a few percent of global lightning activity [Rodger et\nal., 2009]; however, an investigation by Jacobson et al.\n[2006] has shown that the WWLLN supplies spatially\naccurate and representative detection of lightning storms\nas a whole, meaning that the accuracy is sufficient for\nthis comparison.\n[15] Lightning breakthrough perturbations, when present,\nwere seen on all VLF channels received at SGO, in the\nform of 0.5\u20131.0 s increases in amplitude. Many pertur-\nbations were coincident in time across multiple channels.\nFor the five VLF transmitter signals recorded at below\n30 kHz at Sodankyl\u00e4, the absolute amplitude of the peak\nperturbations were approximately the same for each event,\nbut also varied from event to event, which is consistent\nwith the perturbations being caused by lightning pulses of\ndiffering strengths (i.e., discharges with differing currents\nand orientations). These characteristics differ from the\nNBEs that we are studying here, in that the NBEs asso-\nciated with high geomagnetic activity typically last longer\nby a factor of 3\u20134 when compared with the lightning\neffects, and unlike the lightning effects the geomagnetic\nNBEs are observed to have a near\u2010constant amplitude\nfrom event to event. Only WWLLN\u2010detected lightning\nstrokes within 500 km of SGO were observed to produce\ninterference on strong VLF signals, although that dis-\ntance depends on the amplitude of the transmitter signals\nat the time. Weaker transmitter signals can be influenced\nby a relatively weak lightning signal, whereas stronger\ntransmitter signals would remain unaffected.\n[16] Figure 6 shows a lightning breakthrough pertur-\nbation on 1428 UT, 24 May 2005, which was coincident\nwith a strong lightning strike within 100 km of Sodankyl\u00e4,\nobserved on many of the transmitter signals at the same\ntime. All of the transmitter signals shown respond to the\nlightning noise with an increase in amplitude, and reach\nFigure 4.

The timescale of the lightning break-\nthrough is \u223c1 s for the Hawaii signal. Figure 6 (bottom)\nshows an extended period of data when an approaching\nthunderstorm generated lightning perturbations with a\nsimilar amplitude compared with the observed geomag-\nnetic NBEs, i.e., \u223c50 dB. The difference in the slow\ngradual rise of the noise level caused by the thunderstorm\non 27 May 2005 should be contrasted with the onset of\ngeomagnetic NBEs shown in Figure 2. The thunderstorm\nthat generated the \u223c50 dB signals observed in Figure 6 was\nlocated in Russia, \u223c500 km southeast of the receiver at\nSodankyl\u00e4 as determined using WWLLN data.\n3.2. Comparison With Electron Precipitation\nEvents\n[17] Rodger et al. [2007] reported short\u2010lived pertur-\nbations on transmitter signals received at Sodankyl\u00e4\nduring high geomagnetic activity, including the period in\n21 January 2005 that we show in Figure 2. The pertur-\nbations were discussed in terms of the precipitation of\nrelativistic electrons (\u223c1 MeV) into the atmosphere and\nwere termed \u201cFAST events.\u201d In this case the precipitation\ngenerated additional ionization at \u223c60\u201370 km altitudes\nwhich resulted in a sudden change in propagation con-\nditions for the VLF transmitter signals, and a subsequent\nchange in received phase and amplitude. The FAST events\nreported typically had a rapid onset, and lasted \u223c1 s. In\nthis section we investigate if it is likely that the FAST\nevents reported by Rodger et al. [2007] could be the cause\nof the NBEs reported here. The close association with\nperiods of high geomagnetic activity certainly suggests\nthat we should look more closely at the two.\n[18] In Figure 7 we show the amplitude of the NPM\nHawaii, NAAMaine, and NDKNorth Dakota transmitters\nat \u223c1900 UT, 21 January 2005. The data shown are\nfrom a period just after the onset of high geomagnetic\nFigure 6. The effect of lightning NBEs on the\nAARDDVARK data during May 2005.

Showing the comparison between NBEs\nobserved on NPM Hawaii, with FAST events observed on\nNAAMaine, and NDK North Dakota, on 21 January 2005.\nCLILVERD ET AL.: GEOMAGNETIC NOISE BURSTS RS2006RS2006\n6 of 11\nactivity when FAST events were reported by Rodger et\nal. [2007]. The FAST events occurring on NAA and\nNDK are highlighted on Figure 7. The amplitude vari-\nation of the FAST events is both positive and negative,\nand sometime both. This is consistent with the idea that\nthey are produced by small regions of ionization caused by\nenergetic electron precipitation. The type of NBE studied\nhere can be seen on NPM Hawaii at the start of the period\nshown. It is clear that when FAST events occur there is no\ncoincident event on NPM Hawaii, suggesting that geo-\nmagnetic NBEs and FAST events are not linked even\nthough they both occur during high geomagnetic activity.\n[19] At high geomagnetic latitudes, geomagnetic sub-\nstorms can be observed as increases in the absorption\nlevels of riometers as a result of energetic electron pre-\ncipitation in the 30\u2013200 keV range [Kavanagh et al.,\n2007]. As we have previously shown (Figure 5) that the\nNBE occurrence frequency peaks at midnight in the same\nway that substorm signatures do, we might anticipate an\nassociation between riometer observations and the NBEs.\nFigure 8 shows NBE data from 1600 to 2400 UT on\n13 January 2005 recorded at Sodankyl\u00e4 and at Ny \u00c5lesund,\nSvalbard. The AARDDVARK receiver at Ny \u00c4lesund\nwas tuned to 24.8 kHz in order to monitor the NLK\ntransmitter located in Seattle, USA; however, during this\nperiod the transmitter was off\u2010air and the receiver was\nlogging the noise levels until about 2330 UT when NLK\nbegan transmitting again. Figure 8 (bottom) shows the\nKilpisj\u00e4rvi (L \u223c 6.1) riometer absorption data from the\ncentral beam (beam 25). Vertical dotted lines indicate\nthe onset times of three substorm periods.\n[20] Figure 8 shows that NBEs can be closely associated\nwith substorm events. There appears to be some causal\nlink between the short\u2010lived periods of high absorption\nin the riometer data, particularly at the start of each\nsubstorm, and the occurrence of NBEs. At Sodankyl\u00e4\nthe NBEs tend to last for the whole period that the\nriometer absorption is elevated, while at Ny \u00c5lesund only\nthe first substorm shows a rate of NBE occurrence that\nis similar to that observed at Sodankyl\u00e4. The NBE data\nfrom Ny \u00c5lesund show that NBEs can be observed at\nreceiver sites other than Sodankyl\u00e4, although there are\nclearly temporal differences in the timing of NBEs\nbetween the two sites shown in Figure 8. The Ny \u00c5lesund\nNBE observations also strongly suggest that these events\nare due to broadband noise emissions, and not caused by\nchanges in subionospheric propagation, given the NLK\ntransmitter was not broadcasting at this time and also\nbecause of the different frequency being monitored com-\npared with Sodankyl\u00e4 (24.8 kHz compared with 21.4 kHz).\nLubchich et al. [2006] discussed the generation of broad-\nband emissions associated with 10\u2013100 keV electron pre-\ncipitation during substorms. Using broadband observations\nfrom Finland they showed that substorm\u2010associated chorus\nin the frequency range 0.3\u20131 kHz was observed in the\nregion of Sodankyl\u00e4, Finland, close to the location where\nour NBE observations were made. However, these broad-\nband emissions are not in the right frequency range to\nexplain the observations of NBEs during substorms.\n[21] Analysis of WWLLN lighting data during this\nperiod shows that the nearest thunderstorm activity was\nin the Mediterranean Sea, just off the coast of Libya. The\ndistance from the thunderstorm location to Sodankyl\u00e4 is\n\u223c6000 km, and to Ny \u00c5lesund is \u223c8000 km, strongly\nsuggesting that these NBEs are not associated with\nlightning noise.\n3.3. Comparison With Geomagnetically\nInduced Currents\n[22] Geomagnetically induced currents occur during\nhigh geomagnetic activity and can be detected at high\nFigure 8.

Currents flowing in the ion-\nosphere map down to ground level and can induce effects\nin electrical systems. Viljanen et al. [2001] studied GICs\nin Scandinavia from 1999 to 2000. They showed that the\ndiurnal variation of GICs in central and southern Finland\npeaked between 0000 and 0200 MLT (2100\u20132300 UT)\nwith a relatively smooth decrease of occurrence toward\nthe middle of the day. In the same study, Viljanen et al.\nalso showed that the rate of change of the horizontal\ncomponent of the geomagnetic field (a proxy for GICs)\nshowed a similar diurnal variation for subauroral lati-\ntudes, but peaked at 0700 MLT (0400 UT) in the higher\u2010\nlatitude auroral zone in Finland. The diurnal variation of\nNBEs shown in Figure 5 is consistent with the time vari-\nation of GICs in the subauroral zone and strongly sug-\ngestive of GIC as a cause of the NBE phenomenon.\n[23] In Figure 9 we compare the effect of geomag-\nnetic activity on the induced currents measured in the\nScottish Power system transformers in southern Scotland\n(Strathaven, L \u223c 2.8) during 15 May 2005. The temporal\nresolution of the GIC observations was 1 s. Figure 9a\nshows the temporal variation of the system current, while\nFigure 9.

Figures 9c and\n9d show the NBEs seen at Sodankyl\u00e4 at the same time.\nThe Sodankyl\u00e4 NBE rate (Figure 9c) was calculated by\nusing a simple threshold test, triggering on the upward\nslope of the NBE, and discounting any further triggers\nuntil 4 s later in order to reduce the effects of temporal\nstructure in the NBE signature. Rapid changes in the\nScottish power current begins at the same time as the\noccurrence of Sodankyl\u00e4 NBEs, starting at 0230 UT as\nshown by the vertical dot\u2010dashed lines, and shows very\nsimilar behavior over the next few hours. The peak of the\nStrathaven short\u2010period currents occurs from 0600 to\n0700 UT, which is also noticeable as a period of high\nSodankyl\u00e4 NBE rate. There is also close coincidence during\na period of reduced GIC activity starting at 0700 UT and\nlasting until 0730 UT. The NBEs are similarly reduced\nduring the same period.\n[24] An analysis of the data presented in Figure 9\nindicates that there is little evidence of a one\u2010to\u2010one\ncorrespondence between the GICs and NBEs. The majority\nof the spectral power in GICs is in periods > \u223c10 s, so it is\nunlikely that there would be a clear one\u2010to\u2010one relation\nwith NBEs.\n[25] Although no observations of GIC activity were\nmade in Finland for 15 May 2005 we are able to make an\nestimate using the magnetometer located in Sodankyl\u00e4.\nFigure 9e shows the time derivative of the X component\nof the SGO magnetometer (\u2212dX\/dt), which is located at\nthe same site as that where the NBE observations were\nmade. The parameter \u2212dX\/dt corresponds to the eastward\ncomponent of the geoelectric field and is representative\nof GIC activity levels. There is a close correspondence\nbetween the time derivative of the magnetometer data\nand the NBE occurrence rate, although the NBE rate does\nnot provide any sign information and is in effect pro-\nportional to (\u2212dX\/dt)2.\n[26] Figure 9 also indicates that the number of NBEs\nincreased again after 1900 UT along with probable GIC\nactivity in Finland suggested by the SGO magnetometer\ndata, while the GIC level in Scotland remained close to\nzero. The NBEs\/GICs observed at the high\u2010latitude\nSodankyl\u00e4 site are likely to have been generated by sub-\nstorm activity at this time of day, close to magnetic mid-\nnight. However, the Scottish power grid at midlatitudes\nwas primarily responding to a large geomagnetic storm\n(Kp = 9) during the early part of 15 May 2005, and not\nthe more poleward current systems of the substorms that\nfollowed.\n4. Discussion and Summary\n[27] In this study we have reported the characteristics of\nnoise burst events (NBEs) observed at Sodankyl\u00e4, Finland,\nduring January\u2013April 2005 in the frequency range 20\u2013\n25 kHz. The NBEs tend to last up to 4 s, occur more\noften at midnight, are associated with high geomagnetic\nactivity, and exhibit a quasi\u2010constant amplitude pertur-\nbation. The NBEs have typical amplitudes that are > 15 dB\nabove the background noise levels.\n[28] We have considered the possibility that the NBEs\ncould be caused by lightning noise breakthrough. The\nassociation of the NBEs with local midnight and high\ngeomagnetic activity argues against a lightning link,\nalthough a similar sudden enhancement of \u201catmospherics\u201d\ncaused by changing radio wave propagation conditions as\na result of solar flares (SEA [Sao et al., 1970]) is well\nknown. It is reasonable to consider that the occurrence of\nNBE periods might be the result of enhanced lightning\n\u201catmospheric\u201d amplitudes caused by improved radio wave\npropagation conditions during geomagnetic substorms.\nHowever, using the WWLLN data we have been able to\nshow that a thunderstorm generating lightning \u201catmo-\nspherics\u201d that exhibited noise levels 15 dB above the\nnormal background noise levels needed to be \u223c500 km\nfrom the receiver at Sodankyl\u00e4. Analysis of NBE periods\nhave shown that, particularly during the winter months,\nthunderstorm activity is typically more than an order of\nmagnitude more than that distance from Sodankyl\u00e4, well\ntoward the equator and away from the high\u2010latitude region\nof substorm\u2010induced changes in radio wave propagation.\n[29] We also considered the possibility that energetic\nelectron precipitation could cause short\u2010lived enhance-\nments in ionization, which would perturb radio wave signal\npropagation. While energetic electron precipitation is also\nassociated with high geomagnetic activity we have pre-\nsented observations from Sodankyl\u00e4 that have both NBEs\nand FAST precipitation events [Rodger et al., 2007]\noccurring, but they occur at different times, and exhibit\nsignificantly different amplitude characteristics. The ob-\nservation of NBE at Sodankyl\u00e4, Finland, and Ny \u00c5lesund,\nSvalbard, at the same time during a series of substorms also\nargues against energetic electron precipitation as a result of\nradiation belt processes, as one of the transmitters was not\nbroadcasting at the time and therefore no scattering of the\ntransmitter signal could have occurred.\n[30] Finally we considered the possibility that NBEs\nwere caused by geomagnetically induced currents (GIC)\ndriven by high geomagnetic activity and substorms. We\ncompared in detail the GICs induced in the Scottish\npower system in southern Scotland, during a storm event\nthe occurred on 15 May 2005, with the NBE rate at\nSodankyl\u00e4. We found that the onset time and variability\nof the Scottish GIC activity was well matched by the\nvariability in the Sodankyl\u00e4 NBE rate. Induced voltages\nin the receiver aerials or nearby electrical systems could\nbe expected to produce electrical noise that was quasi\u2010\nconstant in amplitude which is consistent with the\nCLILVERD ET AL.: GEOMAGNETIC NOISE BURSTS RS2006RS2006\n9 of 11\nobserved amplitude behavior of NBEs. A simple test of\nadjusting the Sodankyl\u00e4 aerial earthing configuration\nproduced changes in the amplitude of NBEs during high\ngeomagnetic activity, although they were always present\nduring periods of high geomagnetic activity and could not\nbe removed completely. Even though this is consistent\nwith the idea that the NBEs are induced in the aerial\nsystem itself it does not exclude the possibility that GICs\ncause the saturation of high\u2010voltage transformers in the\nvicinity of the VLF receivers, giving rise to strong impul-\nsive noise which is affected by overvoltage protection in\nthe aerial system. The observation of NBEs at Ny\u00c5lesund,\nas well as Sodankyl\u00e4, indicates that different types of\nVLF aerial system configurations are susceptible to geo-\nmagnetically induced NBEs, and reduces the chances that\nNBEs are due to lightning breakthrough or electron pre-\ncipitation events. We conclude that GICs are the most\nlikely source of NBEs.\n[31] Our study leads to the conclusion that it is possible\nto use rate of occurrence of NBEs as an indicator of GIC\nevents, particularly the high\u2010frequency component of the\nfluctuations. VLF receiver systems are simple, low cost,\nportable, and easy to install, and as such can be used to\nprovide measurements of GICs in remote areas, or on a\ncampaign basis. The technique used here of observing at a\nnarrow band of frequencies allows measurements to be\nmade in built\u2010up areas where mains interference is a\nproblem for other experiments, such as magnetometers.\nFurther work is planned to compare the coincident NBEs\nobserved at Sodankyl\u00e4 and Ny \u00c5lesund.\n[32] Acknowledgment.
