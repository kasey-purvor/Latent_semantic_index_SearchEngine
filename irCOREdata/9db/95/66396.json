At present this leads to an uncertainty in the \u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3 branching\nratio which can only be fixed by further precision data on the f0(980).\n1\n1 Introduction\nMuch has been written about the possible nature of the f0(980) and a0(980) states. Are\nthey conventional qq scalars, or KK molecules, or 4 quark states? Are these two states with\nalmost degenerate masses closely related, or is the degeneracy just an accident?\nA clue to the composition of these states is provided by the way they appear in \u03c6-radiative\ndecays. The \u03c6 provides us with a clean ss system, which picks out the components of each of\nthese states that couples to strangeness, even though their masses are below KK threshold.\nConsequently, the f0(980), in particular, appears as a peak in the pipi decay distribution, as\nseen in \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6(pipi) or Ds \u2192 pi(pipi), while in channels in which the f0(980) is produced from\npredominantly non-strange quarks, as in pipi \u2192 pipi scattering or in central dipion production\nwith pion or proton beams, it appears as a dip or a shoulder.\nThe absolute values of the branching ratio for \u03c6 \u2192 f0\/a0\u03b3, as well as the ratio of these\nratios, has been advertised in the past as a guide to distinguish nn from ss from KK and\nqqqq systems, as summarised in Table 1 [1, 2].\nComposition BR(\u03c6\u2192 \u03b3f0(980))\nqqqq O(10\u22124)\nss O(10\u22125)\nKK < O(10\u22125)\nTable 1: Predictions for the absolute rate for \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b3f0(980) depending on the\ncomposition of the f0(980) [1, 2].\nAccording to this, the first results from the two VEPP-2M experiments at Novosibirsk [3, 4, 5]\nindicate a four quark composition. However, it is now known that the strong suppression of\nthe \u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3 branching ratio in the molecular models indicated in Table 1 is wholly because\nof over-simplified modelling of the decay process in this case, as pointed out by Oller [6], so\nany conclusion about a four quark composition is far from certain.\nThe \u03b7pi-channel by which the a0 is identified is clean with very little background, either\nbackground from competing 7\u03b3 final states, but also from other hadronic states \u2014 none are\n2\nnearby. In contrast the f0(980) \u2192 pi0pi0 decay gives a final state that has an experimental\nbackground from \u03c10pi0, where the \u03c10 \u2192 pi0\u03b3, as well as a significant contribution from\nthe production of \u03c3 \u2192 pi0pi0. These backgrounds mean that the extraction of the \u03c6 \u2192\nf0(980)\u03b3 signal depends on our ability to separate the different components. The \u03c1pi signal\nis characterised by a different angular dependence than that for f0\u03b3. The former is flat in\ncos \u03b8, while the latter has a (1 + cos2 \u03b8) distribution. The KLOE data [7] reveal that the \u03c1pi\ncomponent is essentially negligible and we will take that as read. To separate the different\nscalar pipi components, in particular the \u03c3 from the f0(980), models of these two states are\nused. Since the \u03c6-radiative decay data alone cannot determine the masses and widths of\nthese resonances, their key parameters are taken to be fixed by other experiments.\nFor instance, the KLOE collaboration have made a determination of the BR(\u03c6 \u2192 f0\u03b3)\nfrom their own data and found this to be 4.5 \u00b7 10\u22124. So why is the reanalysis presented\nhere necessary? Firstly, the KLOE group adjust the f0(980) mass and width to give the\nbest fit to their data. This results in a mass of 969 MeV with a width of 150 \u2212 250 MeV.\nThis width is, as we shall recall shortly, far larger than other determinations of the f0(980)\nwidth, which are typically 50 MeV (see for example Ref. [8]). Consequently, their f0\npeak sweeps in a larger range of pipi production and this inevitably leads to a very large\nvalue for the BR(\u03c6 \u2192 f0\u03b3). Clearly a more conventional f0 width would mean that the\nsignificant production of two pions with mass of 800\u2212900 MeV must come from some other\nsource than the f0(980). Having adjusted the parameters to maximize the agreement with\ntheir data, the KLOE group then add a \u03c3 contribution, where the parameters for this low\nmass pipi enhancement is taken from the maximum likelihood fit by Fermilab-E791 to their\nD \u2192 3pi data. The E791 analysis is cast into doubt by the implied phase of their S-wave\npipi production amplitudes not being consistent with the phase determined in the pipi elastic\nscattering. Moreover, KLOE just add this contribution to that of their broad f0(980) with\nno regard for the quantum mechanical bound that probabilities must not exceed 100%, i.e.\nthey violate unitarity. The KLOE data alone cannot determine the parameters of both the \u03c3\nand of the f0(980). Consequently, we embark on a new determination of BR(\u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3) which\nautomatically embodies coupled channel unitarity and is in accord with meson scattering\ninformation on pipi and KK production. We than use the \u03c6 radiative decay datasets to fix\nthe relevant couplings.\nIf the resonant states that contributed to the decay \u03c6\u2192 \u03b3pipi were narrow and well-separated\nthen the branching ratio to any of these could be established by simply fitting data with\n3\nappropriate Breit-Wigner forms. However, the scalar f0(980) overlaps with the notoriously\nbroad f0(400\u2212 1200) (or \u03c3), and couples strongly to the KK channel that opens within its\nwidth. Moreover, since below 1 GeV the pipi channel is effectively the only open hadronic\nchannel, unitarity is a particularly powerful constraint. This requires all processes in which\na dipion system is produced to have closely related final state interactions. A relationship\nembodied in Watson\u2019s famous theorem. Consequently, the S\u2212wave pipi system produced in\n\u03c6\u2212radiative decay is already exposed in other hadronic processes, particularly high energy\nreactions where the di-pions are either peripherally or centrally produced. Only if the states\nin this system were narrow and well-separated would fitting be a matter of taking Breit-\nWigners with couplings to be determined as the KLOE group do.\nThe coupling of a resonance is only determined independently of any other resonance with\nwhich it may overlap, or independently of any non-resonant background, by continuing the\nresulting \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b3pipi amplitude into the complex s plane to the f0 pole on the appropriate\nunphysical sheet. The residue of the pole gives the coupling and this is the only model-\nindependent parameter that can be determined. In the case of a narrow isolated resonance\nthis coupling given by the pole residue is directly related to a branching ratio. Where\nstates are not narrow, or overlap with each other or with strongly coupled thresholds, the\nbranching ratio is only related to this coupling in a model-dependent way, unless one has\ndata of infinite precision. Consequently the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b3pipi branching ratios we quote are (like\nthose of all authors) subject to model dependence of the f0 line shape.\n2 Unitarity and underlying hadronic amplitudes\nUnitarity has to be respected. The natural way to ensure this is to represent the purely\nhadronic scattering amplitudes with definite angular momentum by the T -matrix and express\nthis in terms of a real K-matrix. Then with \u03c1 the diagonal phase space matrix, we have\nT = K (I \u2212 i \u03c1K)\u22121 . (1)\nThe amplitude F describing the production of the same final state with the same quantum\nnumbers is then related to the T -matrix, provided the \u201cproduction\u201d process has no other\nstrongly interacting final states, or as in an isobar picture one assumes only isobar interac-\ntions with negligible 3 or more body interactions. The relation between F and T is then\nimplemented using either the P -vector or Q-vector (here called equivalently the \u03b1\u2212coupling\n4\nvector), so that\nF = P (I \u2212 i \u03c1K)\u22121 = \u03b1T . (2)\nThere are constraints on P and \u03b1, which have to be satisfied. Firstly,\n\u2022 P and \u03b1 are real vectors,\n\u2022 If the K-matrix elements have poles, then these must also appear in the P -vector.\n\u2022 While the latter constraint is automatically built into the coupling vector representa-\ntion, care must instead be taken of the zeros of the T -matrix elements. Thus \u03b1 has\npoles to remove any real zeros of the T -matrix, or its determinant.\nThe P\u2212vector and \u03b1\u2212vector formulations are, of course, equivalent. They each embody\nthe universality that demands that poles of the S-matrix transmit to all processes with the\nsame quantum numbers in exactly the same position. That this is a fundamental S-matrix\nprinciple has been questioned in a series of papers by the Ishidas [9], as being incompatible\nwith quark dynamics. However the principle of universality is a consequence of causality and\nthe conservation of probability for hadronic reactions totally independently of the underlying\ndynamics of the supposed constituents of hadrons. This universality is not an optional\nconstraint or a matter of debate. It is a rigorous consequence of fundamental principles\nthat define what is meant by the hadron spectrum. This universality of strong interactions\napplies to \u03c6-radiative decay, since the photon-hadron interaction is electromagnetic, and the\n\u03c6 and pi are presumed to have negligible strong interactions.\nThough the P\u2212vector and \u03b1\u2212vector formulations are equivalent and translatable one-to-\none, one form may be easier to implement in practice than the other. We will use the\ncoupling vector formulation. In the energy range accessed in \u03c6 radiative decay, the only\nhadronic intermediate states that can possibly enter into pipi production are pipi and KK.\nConsequently we introduce two functions \u03b11 and \u03b12, which represent the coupling of the\n\u03c6 to \u03b3pipi and \u03b3KK, respectively. Provided these functions are real for pipi energies above\nthreshold, then 2-channel unitarity is satisfied by construction.\nThe amplitude, F , for S\u2212wave dipion production in \u03c6 radiative decay is thus related to the\ntwo hadronic scattering amplitudes, T11 for pipi \u2192 pipi, and T12, for pipi \u2192 KK. \u20181\u2019 labels\nthe pipi channel and \u20182\u2019 the KK, and time reversal invariance implies that T12 = T21. Each\namplitude and coupling function depends on s the square of the mass of the dipion system.\n5\nThen unitarity requires:\nF (s) = \u03b11(s) T11(s) + \u03b12(s) T12(s) . (3)\nThe hadronic elements Tij typically have real Adler zeros at s = sij , and the two channel\ndeterminant T11 T22 \u2212 T 212 may have a real zero at s = sT . These zeros do not in general\ntransmit to the decay or production amplitude, being process specific. The Adler zeros of\nthe hadronic amplitudes are, in the analyses we use, taken to be at the same position so\ns11 = s12 = s22 = s0. Moreover, the decay amplitude for \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b3(pipi) is expected to have\nits own (process-dependent) Adler zero at s = sA. Consequently, the coupling functions are\nparametrised to incorporate this zero, while eliminating those in the underlying T -matrix\nelements and their two channel determinant, in the following straightforward way:\n\u03b11(s) =\n(s\u2212 sA)\n(s\u2212 s0)\n{\np1(s) +\n\u03b2\n(s\u2212 sT )\n}\n,\n\u03b12(s) =\n(s\u2212 sA)\n(s\u2212 s0)\n{\np2(s) \u2212 \u03b2 rT\n(s\u2212 sT )\n}\n, (4)\nwhere \u03b2 is a dimensionful constant, rT = T11(sT )\/T12(sT ) and the pi(s) are expected to be\nrepresented by low order polynomials \u2014 all real.\nFor the hadronic T -matrix we will use a K-matrix analysis of meson production by Morgan\nand Pennington which updates the AMP analysis of Ref. [10] with the constraints on near\nKK threshold production of Ref. [11]. This is referred to as the ReVAMP analysis. The\nhadronic amplitudes embody the information we have on the structure of the f0(600) (or \u03c3)\nand the f0(980). Even though this is an old analysis, the features of the embedded f0(980)\n(pole position, mass and width) are in excellent agreement with the most recent data on Ds\ndecays into pions. The interpretation of these in terms of possible quark structure is then\nto be elucidated by the coupling of the \u03c6\u2192 \u03b3f0.\nLater we will compare the fits obtained using this set of underlying amplitudes with those\nfound by using a second input, from a much more complete and much more recent analysis\nof a wide range of di-meson production data by Anisovich and Sarantsev [12]. This we\nreference as the AS analysis. The two sets of hadronic amplitudes, ReVAMP and AS have\nquite different parameters for the f0(980), see Table 2, and this difference leads to distinct\n\u03c6\u2192 \u03b3f0 couplings, as we will discuss in Section 5.\n6\nReVAMP AS\nPole (MeV) ER = (989\u2212 i \u00b7 22) ER = (1024\u2212 i \u00b7 43)\ngpi (MeV) 163 328\ngK (MeV) 173 398\n\u0393pi (MeV) 25 98\n\u0393K (MeV) 3 36\nTable 2: Pole position, pipi, KK couplings and widths relative to the f0(980)\nembedded in the two different schemes ReVAMP [11] and AS [12]. Note that in\nthe AS underlying amplitudes the f0(980) is a much broader resonance than in\nthe ReVAMP amplitudes.\nIt is important to appreciate that hadronic data may well be fitted equally well by sev-\neral K-matrix parametrisations. The resulting T -matrix elements will be identical within\nexperimental uncertainties and should provide the same poles of the T -matrix. However,\ndepending on how the underlying K-matrix is described in terms of poles alone, or poles\nplus some background, the poles of the K-matrix may be quite different in number and\nin quite different positions. This is of no physical consequence. However, it clearly does\nhave consequences for those that identify the poles of the K-matrix with underlying bare\nstates [13]. It is important to realise that this is a modelling, that may or may not accord\nwith QCD. Having a range of K-matrix parametrisations of the same data recognises that\nwe cannot yet calculate in detail the strong physics aspects of QCD. Only if one desires to\nimbue the K-matrix elements themselves with significance is it necessary to ensure that the\nK-matrix elements have the correct left hand cut analyticity, whilst fitting along the right\nhand cut. If the elements are just a convenient way of parametrising data along the unitarity\ncut, then approximating distant left hand cut effects by poles and a polynomial background\nis sufficiently general.\nThough the hadronic amplitudes ReVAMP and AS are the results of fits to similar datasets\non pipi and KK production data, they have quite different parameters for the f0(980) as\nindicated by the pole positions, see Table 2. (The precise definition of the quantities gpi,\u0393pi\nand gK ,\u0393K will be explained later.)

In the upper picture the modulus of the isospin zero amplitude T11 is plotted on top of\nthe results of the Ochs-Wagner analysis of the CERN-Munich data [14]. In the lower picture the\nmodulus squared of the pipi S-wave (which includes the contribution from the I = 2 channel [17])\nis plotted on top of the BNL-E852 data of Ref. [15]. On both plots the low energy data (circles)\ncorrespond to the BNL-E865 measurement of K+e4 decays [16]. Differences between the data and\nthe pipi amplitudes is attributed to non-pion exchange contributions to di-pion production, which\nare markedly different in the two cases.\n8\nthe f0(980) we show the underlying pipi amplitude T11 as computed in the ReVAMP and in\nthe AS scheme, compared with the CERN-Munich [14], BNL-E852 [15] and BNL-E856 [16]\ndata. By comparing the solid and dashed lines it is immediately apparent that the f0(980)\nembedded in the AS amplitudes, which is responsible for the dip in the I = J = 0 pipi \u2192 pipi\ncross-section, is a much broader resonance than in the ReVAMP amplitudes. Moreover, as\nwe can see in Table 2, in the AS scheme the f0(980) corresponds to a pole situated above\nKK threshold and has a mass larger than the mass of the \u03c6, ReER > m\u03c6, as opposed to\nthe ReVAMP\u2019s f0. These differences will critically influence the calculation of the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b3f0\ncoupling, obtained by continuing the amplitude F (s) into the complex energy plane on the\nsecond sheet to the f0(980) pole, as will be evident in Section 5.\n3 The Fit\nBased on Eqs. (3-4), our simultaneous fits to the experimental data are performed using the\nexpression\nd\u0393(\u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3)\ndE\n= \u03c1(s) |F (s)|2 , (5)\nwhich relates the experimental decay rate to the amplitude F (s). Here\n\u221a\ns = E = Mpipi is\nthe invariant mass of the di-pion system; \u03c1(s) is the appropriate three-body phase space for\nthe decay \u03c6\u2192 \u03b3(pipi)\n\u03c1(s) =\npi2\n2m3\u03c6\n(m2\u03c6 \u2212 s)\n\u221a\ns\u2212 4m2pi , (6)\nand F (s) is the complex amplitude, which is related by unitarity to the hadronic amplitudes\nT11(s) and T12(s) through Eq. (3). The data, of course, know about gauge invariance of the\nphoton field and so the fits require the coupling functions \u03b1i(s) to have a zero at s = m\n2\n\u03c6.\nHowever, the fitting is aided by building in this consequence of gauge invariance from the\nstart and so we introduce a factor of (1 \u2212 s\/m2\u03c6), where m\u03c6 here is the value of the c.m.\nenergy to which the initial e+e\u2212 beams are tuned (see Ref. [18] for details). Consequently\nwe construct the decay amplitude of Eq. (3) using\n\u03b11(s) =\n(s\u2212 sA)\n(s\u2212 s0)\n{\np1(s) +\n\u03b2\n(s\u2212 sT )\n} (\n1\u2212 s\nm2\u03c6\n)\n,\n\u03b12(s) =\n(s\u2212 sA)\n(s\u2212 s0)\n{\np2(s) \u2212 \u03b2 rT\n(s\u2212 sT )\n} (\n1\u2212 s\nm2\u03c6\n)\n, (7)\nwhere \u03b2 together with the coefficients of the polynomials p1(s) and p2(s) are the parameters of\nthe fit. The AS hadronic amplitudes have no zero in their two channel T -matrix determinant.\nConsequently, in this case \u03b2 = 0, or equivalently sT \u2192\u221e.\n9\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1.1\ndB\nR\/\ndE\n *\n 1\n05\n \n(G\neV\n-\n1 )\nE\n KLOE data\n SND data\n ReVAMP-0\nFigure 2: Simultaneous fits to KLOE [7] and SND [5] data as obtained by using\nthe ReVAMP [10, 11] set of underlying amplitudes, with constant pi(s).\nThe position of the Adler zero required by chiral dynamics is expected to be sA = O(m2pi).\nHowever, our fits prove insensitive to its exact position, so we simply fix sA = 0.\nThe polynomials pi(s) are in general to be as little structured as possible consistent with the\nfitting of the data.

On chi-squared grounds alone\nthe latter would be ruled out as quite improbable. However, we are aware that the AS\namplitudes are the result of studying a far more comprehensive set of hadronic data than\nthe older analysis included in ReVAMP and it is for this reason and that alone that we\ninclude the results using the AS amplitudes.

This procedure ensures the absence of any\nbackground contamination. The pole residue is then evaluated from the strong interaction\namplitudes T (s), and the radiative decay amplitude F (s), which are both pole dominated\nin the neighbourhood of the resonance pole itself, i.e. for s \u223c sR\nT11(s) =\ng2pi\nsR \u2212 s (10)\nF (s) =\ng\u03c6 gpi\nsR \u2212 s (11)\nThanks to the parametrisation of the T \u2019s in terms of theK-matrix, we know their numerators\nand denominators\nT11(s) =\nNpi(s)\nD(s)\n, T12(s) =\nNK(s)\nD(s)\n, (12)\nand consequently we have\nF (s) =\n\u03b11(s)Npi(s) + \u03b12(s)NK(s)\nD(s)\n. (13)\nIn the region nearby s = sR we can write a Taylor expansion of the function D(s) truncated\nat the first order\nD(s \u223c sR) \u223c D(sR) +D\u2032(sR) (s\u2212 sR) = D\u2032(sR) (s\u2212 sR) , (14)\nsince D(sR) = 0 at the resonance pole. By substituting this into Eq. (12) and comparing\nwith Eqs.

(16)\nKnowing the \u03c6 \u2192 f0\u03b3 coupling g\u03c6 is the key result of our analysis shown in Table 4. It\nis this that is model-independent and so can be compared with predictions from different\nmodellings of the make-up of the f0(980).\n13\nReVAMP-0 ReVAMP-II AS-II\ng\u03c6 \u00b7 104 (GeV) 6.21 6.50 18.66\nBR(\u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3) \u00b7 104 0.31 0.34 1.92\nTable 4: Values of the branching ratio BR(\u03c6\u2192 f0(980)\u03b3) and of the g\u03c6 couplings\ncorresponding to different fits to KLOE and SND data using the ReVAMP [11]\nand AS [12] underlying hadronic amplitudes. Note that BR(\u03c6 \u2192 f0\u03b3 \u2192 pi0pi0\u03b3)\nhas been multiplied by a factor three to obtain BR(\u03c6 \u2192 f0(980)\u03b3) to take into\naccount the contribution of the charged pions decay mode of the f0(980).\n4.1 Suppression effect of the photon momentum\nThere is one delicate but crucial point we want to underline. What we are studying here is\nthe radiative decay of the \u03c6. This means that the corresponding amplitude F (s) includes\na factor given by the momentum of the radiated photon k \u221d (1 \u2212 s\/m2\u03c6), which we have\nincluded in the \u03b1 coefficients, see Eq. (7). Now, it is easy to see how this factor produces\na very strong suppression in F (s) in the energy region around 1 GeV, exactly where one\ncalculates the value of the \u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3 coupling g\u03c6. To make it clear we construct the amplitude\nF (s) which one would obtain if the photon momentum factor was divided out of the \u03b1\u2019s.\nThe plots in Fig. 4 illustrate this suppression. Let\u2019s see the details. F (s) is constructed\nfrom T11(pipi \u2192 pipi) and T21(KK \u2192 pipi) with weights given by the coupling functions\n\u03b11 and \u03b12 respectively, according to Eq. (3). In the region around 1 GeV, the amplitude\n|T11|, Fig. 4(a), has a sharp dip, whereas |T12|, Fig. 4(b), shows a pronounced peak (both\nstructures signal the presence of the f0(980)). Because of the peak in the 1 GeV energy\nregion of the \u03c6 \u2192 f0\u03b3 spectrum, one expects the couplings \u03b11, \u03b12 make the contribution of\n|T21(KK \u2192 pipi)| dominate over |T11(pipi \u2192 pipi)| in that region. Though F (s) seen in Fig. 4c\nshows the dominance of \u03b12T21, QED gauge invariance strongly suppresses the amplitude for\nsmall photon energy. This leads to a relative enhancement of the \u03b11T11 contribution away\nfrom the narrow f0(980) peak that is essential for obtaining a good fit, as seen by comparing\nFigs. 4c and 4d.\nThis same photon momentum effect impacts on the determination of the value of the coupling\ng\u03c6 and of BR(\u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3), making them both extremely sensitive to the exact position of the\nf0(980) pole, as we emphasise in the next section.\n14\n00.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1.1\n \n|T11|\n\u221a\ns\n(a)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1.1\n \n|F(s)|-\n\u221a\ns\n(c)\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1.1\n \n|T12|\n\u221a\ns\n(b)\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1.1\n \n|F(s)|\n\u221a\ns\n(d)\nFigure 4: These diagrams illustrate the suppression of the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b3pipi decay\namplitude, F (s), as a function of dipion mass\n\u221a\ns due to photon emission. Plots\n(a) and (b) show the ReVAMP hadronic amplitudes |T11| and |T12| from which\nF (s) is constructed, according to Eq. (3). Plot (c) shows the amplitude |F (s)|\none would obtain if the photon momentum factor k \u221d (1 \u2212 s\/m2\u03c6) was divided\nout from the \u03b11,2. Plot (d) shows the amplitude |F (s)| itself, as determined\nby our fit using the parametrisation of Eq. (7) for the \u03b11,2 coefficients. It is\nimmediately clear that the photon momentum dramatically changes the dipion\nmass distribution. Its effect is particularly striking in the region around 1 GeV,\nwhere the peak in F (s) is very narrow and spiky. Moreover, while |F (s)|, slopes\ndown gently beyond 1 GeV, |F (s)| plummets to zero as k \u2192 0. This illustrates\nwhy the exact position of the f0(980) pole has such a strong effect on the coupling\nand branching ratio for \u03c6\u2192 \u03b3f0(980).\n15\n5 Widths and Branching Ratios\nMost authors, instead of specifying the \u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3 coupling, quote the partial widths and finally\nthe branching ratio BR(\u03c6 \u2192 f0\u03b3). Then to calculate widths and branching ratios one has\nto rely on model dependent assumptions about the resonance line-shape. For instance, one\ncould simply assume\n\u0393\u03c6 =\n1\nmR\n\u03c1\u03c6(m\n2\nR) |g\u03c6(sR)|2 (17)\nusing the value of g\u03c6 as determined by the pole residue, where the pole position is parametrised\nby sR = m\n2\nR \u2212 imR\u0393t. Nevertheless, to take into account the features of F (s) in the neigh-\nbourhood of the f0 resonance pole (in particular its finite width), we use a more refined\nformula which expresses the width \u0393 as an average of the product of the phase space \u03c1\u03c6\ntimes the square of the g\u03c6 coupling integrated over the f0 resonance density\n\u0393\u03c6 =\n\u0393t\npi\n\u222b m2\n\u03c6\nspipi\nds\n\u03c1\u03c6(s) |g\u03c6(sR)|2\n|s\u2212 sR|2 , (18)\nwhere spipi is the pipi threshold value of s, and for s < m\n2\n\u03c6 (cf. Eq. (7))\n\u03c1\u03c6(s) =\npi2\n2m3\u03c6\n(m2\u03c6 \u2212 s)\n\u221a\ns . (19)\nThis would be the obvious procedure for integrating over the finite width of a resonance, if\nthe resonance was isolated. But here the tail of the f0 is not given by any Breit-Wigner shape,\nsince it is intrinsically linked with the \u03c3 as required by unitarity for overlapping resonances.\nConsequently, data never show a pure f0 line shape. So in this case the definition of widths\nand branchings involving the f0 introduce a strong model dependence in the calculation.\nOnce again we stress that it would be wiser to compare values of the the \u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3 coupling\ncalculated in different schemes as the residue of the resonance pole rather than relying on\nthe branching ratio.\nNotice also that whether one uses the definition of decay width from Eq. (17) or from Eq. (18)\nis optional for the fits based on ReVAMP amplitudes, but the choice of Eq.(18) is inevitable\nwhen AS underlying amplitudes are used, since there the f0 pole occurs at an energy larger\nthan m\u03c6, where \u03c1\u03c6(s) = 0. A suitable normalization has to be chosen for the integral in\nEq. (18): we use the \u0393t defined from the imaginary part of the pole position for the f0(980),\nwhich ensures consistency in calculating all the relevant partial widths in this process: \u0393\u03c6,\n\u0393pi and \u0393K . We do not renormalize our partial widths so that the sum of \u0393pi+\u0393K so defined\nequals \u0393t from the pole position as, for example, the authors of Ref. [12] do.\n16\nTable 4 shows the branching ratio corresponding to the pole-determined couplings, g\u03c6, of\nthe two different fits. To understand why the values differ so much, even though the fits\nlook very similar, we have to take a step back and understand the differences between the\nReVAMP and the AS underlying amplitudes.\nThere the pole position relative to the f0(980) resonance is identified by continuing the T\namplitudes into the complex plane, whereas the partial widths are obtained from formulae\nanalogous to Eq. (18)\n\u0393pi =\n\u0393t\npi\n\u222b\nspipi\nds\n\u03c1pi(s) g\n2\npi(sR)\n|s\u2212 sR|2 , (20)\n\u0393K =\n\u0393t\npi\n\u222b\nsKK\u00af\nds\n\u03c1K(s) g\n2\nK(sR)\n|s\u2212 sR|2 , (21)\nwhere spipi and sKK denote the pipi and KK threshold values of s, and\n\u03c1pi(s) =\n\u221a\n1\u2212 4m2pi\/s , (22)\n\u03c1K(s) =\n1\n2\n[\u221a\n1\u2212 4m2K0\/s+\n\u221a\n1\u2212 4m2K+\/s\n]\n. (23)\nAs we discussed in Section 1, the f0(980) is a much broader and heavier object in the AS\namplitudes than in ReVAMP\u2019s. Now, the effect of such a broader resonance in the AS\nscheme is not that evident on the real axis, but becomes very relevant when moving into the\ncomplex s plane past the pole. This effect is transmitted to F (s) = \u03b11T11 + \u03b12T12. On the\nreal axis, where the fits to experimental data are performed, the F (s) amplitudes obtained\nin the two different schemes look very similar, but the similarities fade away as soon as\nwe leave the real axis to move into the complex plane, where the couplings are computed.\nThis is demonstrated in Fig. 5 where the modulus of F (s) is plotted against the real and\nimaginary part of E =\n\u221a\ns in a 3-dimensional plot. Slices of |F (E)| at constant values of\nImE show the profile of |F | when moving further and further into the second Rieman sheet,\nas the pole corresponding to f0(980) takes shape and becomes the dominant feature in that\nenergy range. By comparing the two plots one can readily see the differences between the\ntwo cases: for ReVAMP the pole is narrow and spiky and it occurs below the mass of the \u03c6,\nvery close to KK threshold and not very far into the complex E plane. On the contrary, the\nAS pole is a much broader structure, which occurs at energies higher than m\u03c6 and twice as\nfar from the real axis. These crucial differences explain why the couplings g\u03c6 and branching\nratios BR(\u03c6 \u2192 pipi\u03b3) (shown in Table 4) calculated with two sets of underlying amplitudes\ndiffer so much.\n17\nReVAMP\n0.8 0.85 0.9 0.95 1 1.05 1.1Re E -0.05\n-0.04\n-0.03\n-0.02\n-0.01\n0\nIm E0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n|F|\nAS\n0.8 0.85 0.9 0.95 1 1.05 1.1Re E -0.05\n-0.04\n-0.03\n-0.02\n-0.01\n0\nIm E0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n|F|\nFigure 5: Three-dimensional representation of the amplitude |F | as a function of energy,\nE. This plot shows how the amplitude changes when continued to complex values of E past\nthe f0(980) pole on the second Rieman sheet. Note that in the AS scheme (lower diagram)\nthe f0(980) appears as a broad and pronounced peak, which shows up over more than one\nslice. On the same scale, the ReVAMP f0(980) corresponds to a much narrower and lighter\nresonance with a much more localized effect in the |F (E)| profile (upper diagram).\n18\nWe can now compare the values for the g\u03c6 coupling and the \u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3 branching ratio we find\nfrom our analysis to the numbers obtained by various modellings of the \u03c6 decay into f0\u03b3.\nFirst we consider the decay as if it only occurred through KK loops, i.e. \u03c6\u2192 KK\u03b3 \u2192 f0\u03b3,\nas computed in the models of Ref. [1, 2, 19, 20, 21, 6]. By applying the earlier models of\nRef. [1, 2], in correspondence to the f0 pole positions given by ReVAMP and AS, one would\nindeed find very small values of the \u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3 branching ratio, of order < O(10\u22126), consistent\nwith Table 1. In a more recent K+K\u2212 loop calculation, Markushin presents a study of\n\u03c6 \u2192 pipi\u03b3 decay in a coupled-channel model containing the pipi, KK and qq channels [20].\nThere he finds an f0(980) dynamically generated pole (i.e. a pole which disappears in the\nlarge Nc limit) corresponding to a molecular-like KK state. Nevertheless, the branching\nratio he quotes is BR(\u03c6 \u2192 pi0pi0\u03b3) = 3.5 \u00b7 10\u22124, of the same order of magnitude that older\ncalculation would ascribe to a four-quark state ! Similarly, in Ref. [6] Oller presents the\nlatest update of a calculation of the \u03c6 \u2192 f0\u03b3 branching ratio [21] based on a KK loop\nmodel for \u03c6 decays into two pseudoscalar mesons unitarising Chiral Perturbation Theory.\nIn this paper though [6], a \u03c6\u03b3K0K\n0\ncontact vertex is added to the KK loop diagrams and\nfinite widths effects of the intermediate resonance are taken into account. This leads him\nto find a branching ratio BR(\u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3) even larger than Markushin\u2019s value. However, Oller\nnotes, as we have, that the cubic dependence of the decay width on photon momentum can\nalter the branching ratio by a factor two if the resonance mass is varied by just 5 MeV!\nOur analysis is more general than these specific meson loop calculations, since it does not\nrestrict \u03c6 to decay through a particular channel, but it allows for any possible decay mech-\nanism. Nevertheless, in the limit in which only the T21(KK \u2192 pipi) underlying amplitude\nis used in Eq. (3) for constructing F (s), we can expect our calculation to somehow reflect\nRefs. [1, 2, 19, 20, 21, 6] modelling. In this particular case, we find BR(\u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3) = 0.6 \u00b710\u22124\nfor ReVAMP and BR(\u03c6 \u2192 f0\u03b3) = 1.9 \u00b7 10\u22124 for AS, cf. Table 4. Although the fits do not\nappear too bad when plotted against the data, their \u03c72\/d.o.f. are in the range of 4\u2212 5, so\nthey are not included in Table 5.\nFinally, we compare our results to those reported in the data analyses by the KLOE [7]\ncollaboration at DA\u03a6NE and by the CMD-2 [3] and SND [4, 5] collaborations at VEPP-\n2M. These are summarised in Table 5. KLOE, CMD-2 and SND approach to the problem is\nbased on fitting dBR(\u03c6\u2192 pi0pi0\u03b3)\/dMpipi data with some appropriate Breit-Wigner forms for\nthe f0 and the \u03c3 resonances. The branching ratio is then computed as the area underneath\nthe curve determined by the fit. All their evaluations give similar results because they all\n19\nBR(\u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3) \u00b7 104\nKLOE (4.47\u00b1 0.21)\nCMD-2 (2.90\u00b1 0.21\u00b1 1.54)\nSND (3.42\u00b1 0.30\u00b1 0.36)\nSND \u2013 reanalysis (3.5\u00b1 0.3+1.3\n\u22120.5)\nReVAMP-0 (fit to KLOE+SND data) 0.31\nReVAMP-II (fit to KLOE+SND data) 0.34\nAS-II (fit to KLOE+SND data) 1.92\nTable 5: Values of the branching ratio BR(\u03c6 \u2192 f0\u03b3) as calculated by the\nKLOE [7], CMD-2 [3] and SND [4, 5] collaborations compared with those obtained\nin our determination using the ReVAMP [11] and AS [12] underlying hadronic\namplitudes.\nclosely follow the same prescription, Ref. [19]: again, \u03c6 decays into f0\u03b3 are modelled as if\nthey proceed through K+K\u2212 loops only. The mass spectrum is represented as a sum of three\nterms, one representing the decay of \u03c6 in two pions through a scalar resonance, one taking\ninto account the \u03c1pi background and one corresponding to the interference between them.\nThe mass of the f0 together with the g\u03c6K+K\u2212 and gf0pi+pi\u2212 couplings are free parameters\nto be determined by the fit, whereas the mass and width of the \u03c3 are fixed. Once again\nwe stress that modelling the pipi S-wave spectrum, characterized by wide overlapping and\ninterfering resonances, with a Breit-Wigner model is totally inconsistent with unitarity. In\nfact, the values of the g\u03c6K+K\u2212 and gf0pi+pi\u2212 couplings they find are very large, leading to a\ndisproportionately wide f0(980): \u0393pipi \u223c 150\u2212 250 MeV!\n20\n6 Conclusions\nWe have shown that there is a model independent way to determine the \u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3 coupling g\u03c6,\nwhich we believe is the only rigorously correct way to treat S-wave interactions, where the\nunderlying resonances are far from Breit-Wigner like. It is based on unitarity, which gives\nstrong constraints below 1 GeV where the pipi channel is effectively the only open channel\nand it ensures universality of dipion final state interactions through Watson\u2019s theorem. The\nresults for g\u03c6 are given in Table 4 and for the branching ratio in Table 5.\n\u03c6-radiative decay to the f0(980) in principle provides a way of determining the internal\ncomposition of this enigmatic scalar. Models give quite different predictions for a qqqq or\nss state, with a range of predictions for a KK molecule. Long before experimental data\non \u03c6-radiative decays became available, Achasov [1] stressed that they would reflect QED\ngauge invariance with the decay distribution being proportional to the cube of the photon\nmomentum. He further emphasised that models must incorporate this behaviour too [18].\nWe have seen that these momentum factors make \u03c6-radiative decay a very difficult tool for\nunravelling the structure of the f0(980). The strong suppression as pipi mass approaches m\u03c6\nmakes the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b3f0 coupling, g\u03c6, very strongly dependent on the f0(980) mass and width.\nAt present, analyses of the underlying hadronic processes allow sizeable variation in these\nparameters (see Table 4). This is particularly so because of our poor knowledge ofKK \u2192 pipi\nscattering, as emphasised long ago, for instance in [11].\nNevertheless, the underlying dynamics of the decay is clear. pipi and KK are the only\nhadronic intermediate states relevant to spin zero interactions below the \u03c6-mass. Conse-\nquently, the decay \u03c6\u2192 \u03b3pipi can only proceed either by the coupling \u03b11 of \u03c6\u2192 \u03b3pipi followed\nby pipi interactions or the coupling \u03b12 for \u03c6\u2192 \u03b3KK followed by the KK system producing\na pipi final state. Given the fact that the \u03c6 is overwhelmingly an ss system, we expect the\ncoupling \u03b12 that picks out the KK \u2192 pipi scattering component to dominate. That it does\nis perfectly illustrated in Fig. 4. Recall Fig. 4c shows F (s), the \u03c6\u2192 \u03b3pipi amplitude with the\nphoton momentum divided out. This is seen to look very like T12, the KK \u2192 pipi amplitude,\nparticularly in the 0.95 to 1 GeV region. The pipi \u2192 pipi component, T11, is small but not\nnegligible below 900 MeV. Multiplying the amplitude F (s) by the photon momentum factor\nk \u221d (1\u2212s\/m2\u03c6) (required by QED gauge invariance) to get the full amplitude suppresses the\ncontribution of the KK \u2192 pipi component with its spiky peak close to 1 GeV and enhances\nlower masses where pipi \u2192 pipi interactions dominate. For instance, the photon momentum\n21\nenhances the region at 900 MeV by nearly a factor 3 relative to the peak at 980 MeV, and so\nin the decay distribution, where the photon momentum appears cubed, by a relative factor\nof 24. Looking at the underlying hadronic amplitudes displayed in Figs. 4a,b shows why the\npeak in the \u03c6-radiative decay distribution in the pipi channel is so much wider than the 50\nMeV of the f0(980). Thus models that neglect the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b3(pipi \u2192 pipi) contribution fail to\nreproduce the decay distribution accurately.\nThe KLOE experimental integrated branching ratio is BR(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03b3pi0pi0) = (1.49 \u00b1 0.07) \u00b7\n10\u22124. An f0(980) with conventional parameters of mass 989 MeV and width 44 MeV, as\nincorporated in the ReVAMP amplitudes, gives BR(\u03c6\u2192 \u03b3f0 \u2192 \u03b3pi0pi0) = 0.11 \u00b7 10\u22124 which\nis only 10% of this total distribution. The remaining 90% is from the decay through the\nbroad f0(400 \u2212 1200) (or \u03c3). This is large wholly because of the larger phase space and\nthe photon momentum factors. The coupling to this intrinsically non-strange system is\ncomparable to that expected from the branching ratio of \u03c6\u2192 \u03c1pi. In this case, the coupling\nof the \u03c6\u2192 \u03b3f0 is much smaller than predicted in models with qqqq structure for the f0(980),\nbut rather in agreement with an ss structure or within the newly extended range for a\nKK molecule [6]. In contrast, the underlying AS amplitudes, which embed a wider and\nheavier f0, give BR(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03b3pi0pi0) = 0.64 \u00b7 10\u22124 which is 40% of the experimental branching\nratio and closer to that for a qqqq composition, but the \u03c72 for these fits are significantly\nworse (Table 3).\nPresent \u03c6-decay data do favour the conventional narrow f0(980). Nevertheless, we do need\nto fix T11(pipi \u2192 pipi) and T12(pipi \u2192 KK) in the 1 GeV region very accurately before we can\nreach definite conclusions about the \u03c6\u2192 \u03b3f0 coupling and its consequences for the structure\nof the f0(980). Further direct information on T11 and T12 is unlikely, so to achieve the required\nprecision we need either a careful and exhaustive analysis of the Ds-decay data, which are\npresently being accumulated, or yet higher statistics results on \u03c6-radiative decay with fine\nresolution close to 1 GeV. In either case, these data can only fix the f0(980) parameters if\nthey are analysed in a way consistent with all other sources of information in harmony with\nunitarity. The necessary data are at last becoming available. How to analyse these has been\ndescribed here. The outcome should be clear within 12 months.\n22\nAcknowledgments\nWe wish to thank the KLOE collaboration, and in particular Cesare Bini, for advice on\ntheir data.
