In the\nJOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOTHERAPY\nVOL. 33 NO. 2 2007 134 \u2013 160\nJournal of Child Psychotherapy\nISSN 0075-417X print\/ISSN 1469-9370 online \u00aa 2007 Association of Child Psychotherapists\nhttp:\/\/www.tandf.co.uk\/journals DOI: 10.1080\/00754170701431370\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:0\n3 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nUnited Kingdom, the contextual complexity includes a rapidly changing National\nHealth Service.\nAs illustrative of the difficulties, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence\n(NICE), a body that has an increasingly important role in decision making about\ntreatment choice, uses a notion of a hierarchy of evidence that places the randomised\ncontrolled trial (RCT) at the top as a so-called \u2018gold standard\u2019. In the RCT, carefully\nmatched groups of patients with clearly defined conditions are randomly assigned to a\ntreatment group, a non-treatment group or a group receiving standard care. The degree\nof recovery in the treatment group is compared with that in the non-treated or standard-\ncare control group. The strength of the method is that it allows one to claim with the\ngreatest certainty possible that any significant changes in the treated group are due to the\nintervention rather than to extraneous circumstances.\nFor the child psychotherapy profession as a whole it is clearly necessary that we\nundertake research of this nature. The Systematic Review of Psychoanalytic Approaches\n(Kennedy, 2004) commissioned by the North Central London Strategic Health\nAuthority usefully collates information on the effectiveness of child psychotherapy\ntreatment using the above criteria, and indicates that some progress has certainly been\nmade in response to the challenge facing the profession. In addition, the NHS itself is\nnow encouraging so-called \u2018pragmatic\u2019 trials which recognise the diversity of referral\npopulations while retaining commitment to the RCT.\nHowever, there are many problems with using the RCT as a research method for\nchild psychotherapy. Apart from the ethical problems of withholding treatment from\nchildren who need it, the method requires a level of specificity in selecting and\nmatching numbers of patients that is not feasible in the ordinary family clinic.\nFurthermore, since the RCT requires a homogeneous sample, usually selection is\nmade on the basis of psychiatric criteria. This would exclude a fair proportion of our\ncases, who are very troubled children but who do not reach the threshold for a\npsychiatric diagnosis. On the other hand, selecting a research sample based on\ncontext, life circumstances or presenting problems would be likely to include children\nwho diverge significantly in other ways. In addition, co-morbidity and case complexity\nare becoming defining features in relation to children referred to child and family\nservices, operating at so-called Tier 3 in the UK context. These children often depend\non the support of multiple agencies such as special schools, social services and other\nmedical services. The therapeutic effectiveness of any intervention in these\ncircumstances depends on good liaison and communication to create a developmen-\ntally supportive environment around the child. The RCT cannot capture this\ncomplexity (Richardson, 2003). Finally, there is also the more fundamental problem\nof generalising findings from large-scale research studies to the individual case: it is fair\nto say that the \u2018purer\u2019 the study in traditional scientific terms, the less relevant it\nbecomes for making predictions about individual patients, with the multiple\nproblems and complex family backgrounds that they are likely to bring with them\n(Hollway, 2001, 2004).\nEvaluation frameworks for child and adolescent mental health in general, and child\npsychotherapy in particular, therefore need to address the question of whether\ntreatments work from a number of different perspectives, recognising, as Midgley\nWHAT WORKS FOR WHOM 135\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:0\n3 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\n(2004) suggests, the particular strengths and limitations of both quantitative and\nqualitative methods. The need to progress on a number of fronts has been recognised by\nthe North Central London Strategic Health Authority, which commissioned a second\n\u2018thematic\u2019 review of child, adolescent and parent\u2013infant psychotherapy effectiveness,\ntaking account of a broader range of research models, including qualitative methods,\nsuitable for answering different kinds of questions (Kennedy and Midgley, 2007).\nWithin this diversity, a particularly important set of questions concerns the\nperspective of the service user or users. In the light of the National Service Framework for\nChildren (Department of Health, 2004) child psychotherapists, like other professionals\nin child mental health services, will need to find constructive ways of involving parents,\npatients and referrers in the evaluation and outcome monitoring process. However,\nthere are as yet rather few guidelines on how to proceed.\nAn evaluation of clinical effectiveness\nThis paper presents findings from a qualitative framework used for outcome monitoring\nunder the umbrella of audit. In contrast to the RCT, which uses carefully selected\nsamples, the aim here is to include all comers rather than selecting according to a\nparticular research design or research questions, and to make parents\u2019 experience of the\nchild\u2019s progress in psychotherapy intrinsic to the evaluation process.\nThis approach, the Hopes and Expectations for Treatment Approach (HETA), was\ndeveloped in an inner city London borough characterised by high levels of deprivation\nand ethnic diversity. It is based on a recognition that the work done with parents is\ncrucial to sustaining child psychotherapy and to ensuring its effectiveness. In the light of\nthe National Service Framework for Children (Department of Health, 2004), we are\nlikely to be asked to demonstrate our responsiveness to parents\u2019 experiences of\ntreatment. HETA stresses the particular importance of the assessment for psychotherapy\nwhich normally precedes the beginning of treatment: in building a preliminary picture\nof the child\u2019s internal world and overall development; in formulating an account of\nsymptomatology in psychodynamic terms; in giving the child the experience of being\nunderstood in a way which will reveal his or her availability to respond to the\npsychotherapeutic method; and in informing a case for what psychotherapy might\nachieve.\nBoston and Lush (1994) have demonstrated the value of assessment and formulation\nin setting a baseline or starting point for the evaluation of the individual child\u2019s progress\nin psychotherapy in their longitudinal study of the effectiveness of child psychotherapy\nfor looked-after children. In managing the actual practice of psychotherapy, however, a\nparticularly important part of the assessment is the feedback meeting with the parents or\ncarers. Here, the psychotherapist must report on his or her thoughts after assessing the\nchild in a way that connects with the parents\u2019 own experience. If parents are to accept it,\nthe proposal for psychotherapeutic treatment must make sense in terms of their anxieties\nand understanding as well as the psychotherapist\u2019s formulation of the problem in\npsychoanalytic terms. The connection parents make with the child psychotherapist at\nthis time may be crucial in enabling them to sustain commitment to a lengthy and\ndifficult treatment.\n136 C. URWIN\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:0\n3 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nOur study aims to use not only psychotherapist but also parent experiences of the\nassessment to provide a baseline against which to evaluate the child\u2019s relative progress\nand the direction taken by psychotherapy over the first year.\nThe first of the two following sections describes the methods used to ascertain the\nnature of the population referred for child psychotherapy in the present study, and the\nprocedures used in assessment and evaluation. An example of an assessment of a\nparticular case illustrates what the psychotherapy assessment established, how findings\nwere conveyed to the parents and how hopes and expectations for treatment were\nderived and recorded.\nFindings, presented in the second section, include: first, a survey of all children and\nadolescents referred for psychotherapy over a six-month period; second, an evaluation of\nthe progress of the first 15 cases to complete one year of psychotherapy; and third, a\ndescription of the psychotherapy of the child mentioned above, in order to illustrate\nhow the evaluation framework can capture the relation between the psychotherapy\nprocess and change in the child observed by parents and psychotherapist, and may\nenhance the relation between child psychotherapy and the work with parents\nproceeding in parallel.\nMethodology\nReferral information\nThe evaluation method used aims to provide a thorough account of the population of\nchildren and young people referred to the service for psychotherapy, and to involve the\nreferrers in the evaluation process. As found by Kam and Midgley (2006) in their audit\nof psychotherapy referrals to another inner-city CAMHS, within our service the vast\nmajority of referrals for psychotherapy are internal, made by colleagues in the\nmultidisciplinary team.\nLinda Dawson has designed a psychotherapy referral form to collect relevant\ninformation (see Appendix 1). This records the name and profession of the referrer, the\nchild\u2019s age and ethnicity, the length of time that the child has been involved in work in\nthe service already, any psychiatric involvement, the referrer\u2019s reasons for requesting\npsychotherapy at this point and what he or she hopes it will achieve. This helps to\nprompt the referrer to think about why psychotherapy might be the treatment of choice,\nand provides some baseline information about the referrer\u2019s expectations, for the\nevaluation at the end of treatment. The form also asks referrers about their continuing\ninvolvement, to establish what they can provide in terms of work with the parents.\nInvolvement with social services, education and other agencies will also be noted.\nStandardised measures\nFollowing the psychotherapy referral, and assuming the psychotherapist is satisfied that\npsychotherapy is likely to be a viable option, the child\u2019s parents and school complete a\nStrengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; Goodman, 1997). This questionnaire is\none of the instruments used in the evaluation package developed by the CAMHS\nWHAT WORKS FOR WHOM 137\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:0\n3 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nOutcome Research Consortium (CORC), a multidisciplinary consortium aiming to\naddress the demand for routine clinical effectiveness monitoring in CAMHS in the\nNHS. This package is being used by CAMHS in a number of areas and is likely to be\nintroduced more widely across the UK. The HETA framework for evaluating child\npsychotherapy effectiveness is designed so that it may be run alongside and be compatible\nwith CORC. Findings from the use of the SDQ will be presented in a later paper.\nPsychotherapy assessment\nHETA aims to build on and enhance rather than supplant the assessment method\nnormally used by child psychotherapists. Although individual psychotherapists may\ndiffer, it is usual to see the child individually for two or three assessment sessions, and to\nfollow this with a feedback meeting with the parents. During the series of assessment\nsessions the psychotherapist will develop some kind of psychoanalytic formulation\nexplaining what might underlie the child\u2019s difficulties and why psychotherapy might be\nhelpful. At this point it is helpful if the psychotherapist writes a preliminary version of\nthe formulation for the file.\nAs noted previously, at the feedback meeting with the parents the psychotherapist\naims to make a bridge with the parents, and to explain his or her understanding of how\nthe child\u2019s problems might have arisen in terms that \u2018gel\u2019 with their experience of the\nchild. If the psychotherapist recommends psychotherapy for the child, the case must be\nmade in terms that the parents can appreciate. An illustration of how the formulation\nmay be fed back to parents is given later.\nIf it is agreed that psychotherapy is to begin, the referrer, the parents and the\npsychotherapist have a further meeting to complete the Hopes and Expectations for\nTreatment Record Form (see Appendix 2). This form is in three parts.\nPart 1 records in a relatively simple way the parents\u2019 main concerns, any changes\noccurring during the assessments and the psychotherapist\u2019s impressions of the child,\nsuch as presenting personality, obvious strengths and difficulties and how he or she\napproached the sessions.\nPart 2, headed \u2018What has been agreed\u2019, records the commitment made to\npsychotherapy in terms of intensity and length of treatment. For example, this may\nbe for once-weekly psychotherapy for one year in the first instance, with the added\nexplanation that child psychotherapy usually goes on for longer. Times of sessions and\nthe frequency of meetings between the parents and family worker are included, and a\nstart date is set.\nPart 3 records hopes and expectations, and is in three sections. Section 1 records the\nparents\u2019 hopes for the treatment, in terms of three areas where they would hope to see\nchanges in the course of the year. Importantly, this is not a wish list. Since it follows the\nfeedback meeting, the parents\u2019 expectations should incorporate their understanding of\nthe feedback given by the psychotherapist. Section 2 records three areas in which the\npsychotherapist would anticipate seeing changes within the psychotherapy sessions\nduring the course of the year. These hopes and expectations are based on the\npsychotherapist\u2019s formulation and should include anticipated areas of difficulty and\nresistance. Section 3 records three areas where, given the understanding derived from\n138 C.

For example, parents with concerns about how their son expressed\naggression would consider it progress if he could be more patient with his younger\nbrother by the end of the year, which would be exemplified if he would let him have a\ngo on his PlayStation sometimes.\nReview and evaluation\nOnce psychotherapy has started, the child psychotherapist normally meets with the\nparents, with or without the parent worker, for a review every term. The anticipated\ndevelopments referred to in the HETA record contribute to the background of this\ndiscussion, but the form itself is not brought into the meeting, as focusing parents\u2019\nattention at this time on a desired end point might get in the way of thinking about\nrelative progress or difficulties in the present.\nAt the review at the end of the second term of psychotherapy, a decision may have to\nbe made about whether the psychotherapy will end at the end of the year or continue\ninto a further year. If it is to end, the child will normally be told before the holiday,\ngiving a term to work on ending.\nAt the end of the third term, or the first year of treatment, the child\u2019s progress is\nreviewed with the parents and parent worker in the light of the HETA record.\nAchievements, disappointments and the unexpected are noted. A simple scoring scheme\nused to facilitate an evaluation of the degree of progress is described in the \u2018Findings\u2019\nsection below. The SDQ follow-up questionnaires are administered. If psychotherapy is\nto continue for a further year, which is likely in most cases, the HETA record is\nmodified in the light of what has changed or what has been learned, and the\npsychotherapist\u2019s reformulation. Modifications are introduced to the HETA record each\nyear, and use of the SDQ is continued.\nAt the end of the treatment, information is obtained from the parents regarding their\nperceptions of change in the child, using the HETA record, and they are asked about\ntheir experience of their child\u2019s psychotherapy.\nThese steps are summarised in Figure 1 on the next page.\nThe case of Nicky, below, illustrates an assessment, a feedback meeting and how the\nHETA record is completed.\nAn illustrative case: Nicky\nReferral\nNicky was referred at the age of eight after two previous periods of work in the clinic for\na combination of problems including soiling, aggressive and unmanageable behaviour,\nstealing, lighting fires, a tendency to confuse fantasy and reality and telling lies. He\nfought with his older brother, and had no friends. At the time of referral he was waiting\nfor a place at the local special school for children with behaviour problems; he\nWHAT WORKS FOR WHOM 139\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:0\n3 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nhad a Statement of Special Educational Needs for behaviour problems and learning\ndifficulties. A psychiatrist assessed him for ADHD, found that he did not have ADHD\nand rather reluctantly gave a diagnosis of conduct disorder. The psychiatrist noted\nNicky\u2019s low self-esteem and suspected that emotional factors lay behind many of his\ndifficulties. Nicky is quite good at football but at the time of referral would often spoil\nhis team\u2019s chances by getting sent off for fighting.\nFigure 1 Procedures for assessment, and for completing and reviewing the HETA record.\n140 C. URWIN\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:0\n3 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nOn the referral form, the referrer recorded that she hoped that psychotherapy\nwould help Nicky feel better about himself, and that this would improve family\nrelationships and help him make good use of his place at the special school, available\nthe following term. A significant family factor is that Nicky\u2019s father injured his back\nvery severely in a car accident when Nicky was five years old, shortly before the first\nreferral. He had not been able to work since at his job as a lorry driver. He is involved\nin looking after both boys.\nAssessment sessions\nAs is my usual practice, Nicky\u2019s parents attended for the first part of the first assessment\nsession. A slight boy, squeezed shyly between his parents, Nicky reached for the toy tiger on\nthe table as his father began to speak, then withdrew when his mother joined in with a long\nlist of problems, taking himself off to the back of the room with a ball. The parents\u2019 tone\nsoftened as they explained that one of the problems was that Nicky was not as able as his\nelder brother and that he minded about this. Nicky returned to the table and was very\nattentive when I asked about early history. Both parents agreed that Nicky did not seem to\nhave difficulties at nursery school, though it had been hard to toilet-train him.\nOnce he was on his own with me, it was not hard to engage Nicky, after I understood\nthat he needed help to bring himself forward. He told me his brother always took things\nfrom him. Almost despairing, he explained that his brother was better at things than he\nwas because he was 10. He always would be better than him, because when he was 10\nhis brother would be 12. However, he was encouraged by the idea that when he was\n10 he could be better at things than he is now. Using big animals and little animals,\nhe told me that he was afraid of his father and of the toilet. He thought that something\nwould come out of the toilet and bite him.\nFor the second appointment, Nicky arrived in a new football shirt, plainly for me to\nadmire. He told me that he had had a \u2018terrific\u2019 week at school. This turned out to be true.\nHowever, he also began a detailed account of his football matches, how he had got lots of\ncups, and that there was one \u2018THIS big!\u2019 (Nicky stretched his arms out). He was going to\nbe playing matches in Manchester, Liverpool, Tottenham, Spain, Brazil, etc., etc.\nDespite the grandiosity, the exaggeration was touching in its naivety. Eventually I\ncommented that Nicky felt that coming to see me was very special. \u2018Yes,\u2019 he said, with\ngenuine seriousness. I gently distracted him from playing football in the room and\nsuggested he drew a picture. He said that he was no good at drawing but would have a go.\nUsing a pink wax crayon, he sketched a semi-circle, and added other marks. He then\ntook a black felt-tipped pen and drew a solid semi-circle so that it virtually covered the\npink one. He told me this was a \u2018black moon\u2019. The contrast between these two shapes\nwas shocking. I was reminded of Freud\u2019s (1917) phrase about the \u2018shadow of the object\nthat falls upon the ego\u2019 in Mourning and Melancholia. He added a yellow wax crayon\n\u2018sun\u2019, a blue round shape with green marks, \u2018the earth\u2019, and other shapes, obviously\nplanets. He told me he had been learning about planets at school, and about the\nRomans, and about different places and about things in the past.\nAt this point Nicky picked up the pick-up lorry and the van and explained that the\nvan had broken down. I said that Nicky\u2019s father used to work as a driver, didn\u2019t he?\nWHAT WORKS FOR WHOM 141\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:0\n3 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 he said immediately, \u2018until he got the sack. He got the sack because he wasn\u2019t well.\nHe should have rung in and told them he wasn\u2019t well. He didn\u2019t turn up so he got the\nsack. He should have rung in. I was ringing in on my mobile, \u2018\u2018Hello, my Dad can\u2019t get\nin,\u2019\u2019 but I was too late. He got the sack.\u2019 \u2018What kind of not well?\u2019 I asked. Nicky said,\n\u2018Too much down the pub. It was his heart. He was being sick and it went into his\nheart.\u2019 Rather furtively, Nicky looked round the back of the dolls\u2019 house, then went to\nset up a line of bricks.\nA little later I asked Nicky how using the toilet was going. He said that the poohs\nwere getting better. The trouble now was wees! If he had a drink he has to go to the\ntoilet and doesn\u2019t get there in time and has an accident. I said I was thinking about his\nDad. He had an accident, didn\u2019t he? \u2018It wasn\u2019t my fault!\u2019 Nicky squealed, \u2018It wasn\u2019t my\nfault that he lost his job!\u2019 I said that it was not Nicky\u2019s fault, but he might have thought\nit was. \u2018I get you,\u2019 Nicky said. He seemed relieved by this insight.\nAt the third and final assessment session, Nicky was subdued. I noted that this was\nthe last of our three sessions, and then I would meet with his Mum and Dad. Nicky\nstarted throwing bricks, picking off the cars one by one. Later he made two towers of\nbricks with conical tops. He had to knock the tops off without knocking the rest down.\nI wondered who it was that he would be knocking down, a mother, a father or a\nbrother? \u2018A brother,\u2019 he said instantly. I said it would be difficult to knock down the son\nwithout knocking down the mother as well. I thought he was trying to knock out the\nbaby he felt was blocking the way to the mother. \u2018No,\u2019 he said immediately. \u2018It\u2019s the\nother way round!\u2019 and successfully skimmed the top off a tower. \u2018The mother is no\nproblem. I\u2019m not trying to get to her. She can stay where she is!\u2019\nAt this point I formulated the idea of a rather alarming maternal object, and that\nNicky was looking to be reunited rather than split off from his baby self. Nicky\ncomplained that his brother would not play with him. He came over and made a\ntelephone call on one of my two toy phones. \u2018Tell Cathy I\u2019m coming up to see Nicky\nlater on today!\u2019 Receiving the message, I said, \u2018Nicky? Oh good!\u2019 Nicky blushed. He\nthen telephoned his father, making it clear he needed to speak to him, not me. \u2018Yeah?\nYeah. Alright then. See you later.\u2019 I said that he was checking that it was OK with his\nDad to come and see me, like he might want to check it out with my husband or some\nperson like that. \u2018Yes,\u2019 he said, and smiled and agreed he would like to come again for\nmore work.\nFormulation\nDuring the assessment the referrer saw Nicky\u2019s parents for one appointment. In that\ntime Nicky\u2019s mother told her that Nicky had cried a lot as a baby and that she herself\nhad been very depressed. Both parents felt that Nicky himself was at times depressed.\nGiven the \u2018black moon\u2019 material, this was not surprising. My psychoanalytic\nformulation found Nicky a likeable boy whose problems with behaviour and reality\ntesting were, I thought, probably consequent on a relationship with a depressed primary\nobject, with whom he was partly identified, and which \u2018collapsed\u2019 on him, unable to\ntolerate his ordinary developmental aggression. The subsequent Oedipal development\nand move to identify with his father was itself affected by the trauma of his father\u2019s\n142 C.

That is, phantasy was\nunchecked by external reality. The result was a reduced capacity for symbol formation in\nfavour of rather concrete forms of symptomatology and acting out. The major defence,\nsplitting off his difficulties through an omnipotent reversal and \u2018dumping\u2019 his\ndifficulties, was concretely expressed through soiling.\nNicky\u2019s responsiveness to exploratory interpretation was encouraging, and suggested\nthat psychotherapy could be effective in bringing about some developmental realignment,\nthrough addressing primarily the deficit in the object rather than attempting, for example,\nto challenge the omnipotence and grandiosity head-on. My hypothesis was that a\nstrengthened and more dependable object relation achieved through the dependability of\nthe psychotherapeutic setting would itself reduce impulsivity and contribute to improve-\nments in symbolic functioning and ego development.\nFeedback meeting\nAt the feedback meeting we learned that Nicky had shown much improved behaviour\nand attentiveness at school during the period of the assessment, although soiling\nremained a problem. The parents therefore felt positive about the assessment experience.\nThe task was to feed back some of the thinking expressed in the formulation in a way\nthat would connect with their experience of Nicky.\nI stressed Nicky\u2019s communicativeness and how some of Nicky\u2019s difficulties could be\nbecause in some ways emotionally he was like a younger child. His parents understood\nthe fears about the toilet, as their older boy had been through a phase of thinking that\nmonsters might come out of there. I said that I thought that Nicky would have been\nsensitive to his mother\u2019s depressed state, and that, given his wish to be a super-hero, he\nmay have imagined he caused his father\u2019s accident with his own thoughts. I thought he\nwas confused about how powerful his angry feelings could be. The parents agreed to\nonce-weekly psychotherapy, and we arranged another appointment to complete the\nHETA record form, giving examples of what hoped-for improvements would look like.\nCompleting the HETA record form\nCompleting Section 1, about their own hopes and expectations, the parents hoped that,\nover the course of the year:\n1.

Nicky would become more aware of his feelings so he could think about them\nand not just act them out.\nHow would you tell? Nicky would come to talk more about his feelings when he\nwas playing. I would expect him to use toys, cars, animals and people a bit more,\nplaying football in the room a bit less!\n2. Nicky\u2019s difficulties about separation and separateness would become apparent in\nhis therapy.\nHow would you tell? Nicky might have difficulties coming into or leaving\nsessions sometimes, and he might be particularly thrown by holiday breaks from\nthe therapy. I warned the parents that there might be times when he would not\nwant to come.\n3. I hoped that I would understand more about Nicky\u2019s big imagination.\nHow would you tell? I thought I would get the opportunity to observe, and\nNicky might himself observe, how, if things went a little bit wrong for him, he\nmade them MORE wrong. I hoped that this awareness would help him find\nways of getting back on track.\nOutside the sessions, at home and at school, I hoped that:\n1. Nicky would be more cheerful and optimistic.\nHow would you tell? Nicky\u2019s parents would be able to tell the parent worker\nabout events that Nicky had obviously enjoyed.\n2. There would be improvements in Nicky\u2019s relationships with other children.\nHow would you tell? Nicky\u2019s parents would see Nicky making more effort to\ndevelop skills like taking turns.\n3. Nicky would learn more positive ways of getting attention.\nHow would you tell? Nicky might let his parents know about good things that\nhe had done in school, showing them that he was proud of his achievements.\nThe parent worker arranged to continue to meet the parents every fortnight, to work on\nmanaging behaviour at home in the light of these hopes and expectations. We were able\nto start Nicky\u2019s psychotherapy after the summer holiday. His progress will be described\nafter illustrating general characteristics of the sample.\nFindings\nCharacteristics of referrals for psychotherapy\nIn all, 30 children were referred for psychotherapy to the three clinics in the service over\na six-month period. The referral forms indicated a striking diversity in presenting\nsymptoms as well as complex family factors. Ages ranged from three to 17 years, with\n144 C.

As one might anticipate, more boys\nthan girls were referred until adolescence. A range of ethnicities was represented. Of\nparticular note is the fact that more Bangladeshi children were beginning to be referred\nfor child psychotherapy treatment, although this proportion is below that of\nBangladeshi children in the local population (see Figure 2).\nLike Nicky, the majority of the referred children had been known to other workers\nfor at least a year, many more than two years, and had been seen by several professionals.\nKam and Midgley (2006) reported similar findings. Sometimes, a long period of time\nbefore psychotherapy begins may reflect psychotherapy being seen as a \u2018treatment of last\nresort\u2019 for difficult cases. However, more positively, a sustained period of work before\npsychotherapy begins, supporting parenting skills and reducing the tendency to\nscapegoat the child, may be a valuable or necessary prerequisite before families are ready\nfor the commitment to psychotherapy.\nReferrals came from all disciplines in the service. For this group of 30, the\npredominant referrers were child and adolescent psychiatrists, as indicated in Figure 3.\nThe low numbers of referrals from psychologists and family therapists reflects staff\nvacancies at the time.\nRoughly half of the referred children had, like Nicky, received a psychiatric diagnosis.\nThere were four children with autistic spectrum disorder or Aspergers syndrome.\nNotably, the referrers of these children were not requesting the psychotherapist to cure\nautism, but rather sought changes that might improve the quality of life for the child\nand family: for example, to help a child gain some self-understanding to enable him or\nher to cope with secondary school transfer; to help reduce the frequency of tantrums; or\nto help a child be less sad and become more confident about putting feelings into words.\nFigure 2 Ethnicity of referred children.\nWHAT WORKS FOR WHOM 145\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:0\n3 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nOther diagnoses included ADHD, conduct disorder, post traumatic stress disorder and\ndepression. Four of the children were looked-after children or were living under a care\norder with relatives. This is fewer than the number of looked-after children normally\nreferred to this particular CAMHS in any given six-month period.\nSix child psychotherapists carried out the psychotherapy assessments of this group of\nchildren or adolescents. A referral for psychotherapy does not always lead to a\npsychotherapy assessment, of course, let alone the decision to undertake individual\npsychotherapy. Of the 30 children referred, 18 months later six children had not been\ntaken on for psychotherapy for practical reasons or because the assessment revealed\nother factors that needed to be dealt with first. In contrast, two children did not start\npsychotherapy because of the degree of progress made in the assessment. A further child\nwas seen for short-term individual work and referred on to group work afterwards. This\nleft 21 children for whom long-term psychotherapy was recommended and accepted by\nthe parents or carers.\nIn general, parents described and acknowledged positive changes in their children\nduring the psychotherapeutic assessment. This may itself be prognostic of the child\u2019s\ncapacity to respond to psychotherapeutic treatment. Although most cases had been\nengaged in family work for some time, the psychotherapy assessments also brought to\nthe surface important life history information not revealed in previous work, or that had\nbeen forgotten or had gone unrecorded.\nImpact of starting psychotherapy and clinical effectiveness\nHow can we establish that changes are occurring in the psychotherapy? A simple\nindication can be obtained by scoring the predictions\/expectations made by the\nFigure 3 Agencies referring the children.\n146 C.

As noted previously, the Hopes and Expectations\nfor Treatment Record Form includes three sections: Section 1 records the parents\u2019\nexpectations; Section 2 records the psychotherapist\u2019s expectations for the psychotherapy\nsessions; and Section 3 records the psychotherapist\u2019s expectations for change in the\n\u2018outside world\u2019 \u2013 the home and the school. Each section records three items, with\nexamples required in each case. Using a simple three-point scale to score each item,\nrecording \u2018no change\u2019 as 0, \u2018some change\u2019 as 1 and \u2018significant change\u2019 as 2, the\nmaximum score at each review would be 18.\nOf the 21 children who entered psychotherapy, as described above, 15 have been in\npsychotherapy long enough for there to have been two termly reviews (the second\ndescribed here as the six-month review in Table I), and to have completed one year of\npsychotherapy. At the six-month review, the psychotherapists scored the degree to\nwhich they thought that each of their three expectations for the psychotherapy process\nand for the child\u2019s behaviour at home and at school had been met. This was repeated in\nthe one-year review, after discussion of the child\u2019s progress with the parents and in their\npresence.\nAs shown in Table I, it is striking that, even at the six-month review, scores\nindicated improvements in the children as regards meeting the psychotherapists\u2019\nexpectations of the psychotherapy process and of changes at home and at school. A\nscore of 0 would have indicated no change, but all the children were judged to have\nshown some change or significant change.

In fact, their scores were comparable to the psychotherapists\u2019\nassessments of change in the child at home and at school, indicating high agreement\nbetween the two.\nFrom parents\u2019 comments and observations of their child at the six-month review\nmeeting, estimated scores were assigned retrospectively to obtain some sense of the\nparents\u2019 views of the degree of change. Although an estimate, it is interesting that the\nmagnitude of difference between these estimated scores and the 12-month scores is\ncomparable to that in the psychotherapists\u2019 ratings (see Figure 4).\nThe range of scores shown in Table II varies from 2 to 6 \u2013 the lowest-scoring young\nperson being a refugee teenager living in hostel accommodation for whom no parent\nscores were available. Of course, low scores do not mean that the psychotherapy is not\nworking. For example, this young person developed considerably in the second year of\ntreatment. Sometimes external circumstances intervene. For example, Case 13 suggests\nno development in the last six months in treatment. However, this must be set against\nthe child anticipating the end of treatment because of a disruption to the foster\nplacement.\nTable II HETA scores: comparison between parents\u2019 and CPTs\u2019 scores at 12-month review\nCase Parent CPT (home\/school)\n1 5 6\n2 4 4\n3 4 4\n4 5 3\n5 4 5\n6 5 4\n7 3 4\n8 4 5\n9 5 5\n10 4 5\n11 6 4\n12 5 4\n13 3 3\n14 4 4\n15 \u2013 (2)\nMean 4.36 4.29\nMann-Whitney U U\u00bc 92.5\nz\u00bc70.272\np\u00bc 0.804\n148 C.

The initiation of\npsychotherapy also in many cases revealed greater distress in the parents than was\npreviously recognised. This poses considerable challenge for work with parents.\nHowever, this work can be particularly rewarding, as developments in the child can lead\nto a deepening of the work with the parents, and vice versa. Here there are advantages to\nhaving an evaluation model in which parent work and child work are linked.\nThese processes are illustrated by the work with Nicky; traumatic antecedents of his\nbehaviour difficulties became clear.\nNicky\u2019s psychotherapy\nDespite the optimism we all felt about the psychotherapy, Nicky\u2019s development in\npsychotherapy began with an alarming period for the parents. The holiday before the\nsessions started produced a small upsurge in fire setting. In the new term, the date for\nhis move to special school was put back, changed and put back again, prompting\naggressive and unmanageable behaviour. Nicky felt rejected by the new school and his\ncurrent (female) teacher. He was also suspicious of the psychotherapy. After all, if it was\nany good, he would not have to go!\nNevertheless, Nicky enjoyed coming. A large part of the early sessions were taken up\nwith Nicky and I making and receiving telephone calls and writing letters to family\nFigure 4 Relative changes in mean HETA scores between six and 12 months (including estimated scores at six\nmonths for parents).\nWHAT WORKS FOR WHOM 149\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:0\n3 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nmembers, notably excluding the mother. He seemed to be working out something\nfundamental about communication, and how to contact someone in their absence. He\nwas keen to play games with the fire engine and other vehicles, including a police car\nand a toy plane. As he approached his school move, the mother and her children were\nmercilessly blown up in the dolls\u2019 house by the plane leaking petrol. The police car,\nhowever, was so fierce and punishing that it seemed nothing could be done but to blow\nthis up too, along with the fire engine, destroyed in the crash. I was struck by the\nbadness of the mother and the police car, suggesting a totally unmodulated, savage\nsuperego. Nicky inevitably identified with this to escape its ferocity, illustrating the\ndynamic underlying Nicky\u2019s tendency, when things went wrong, to make them even\nworse, which was captured in the last item on Section 2 of the HETA record. I asked\nmy colleague working with the parents to warn them to expect more fires when Nicky\nhad to move school, in response to the separation.\nDespite the difficulties, Nicky was appreciative of interpretive work, and the\nunderlying archaeology steadily became clearer. This came to a head around Guy\nFawkes\u2019 Day. Nicky talked about remembering a fire he lit when he was very young. He\nbegan a drawing of what happened on \u2018the day when the moon went black\u2019. I wondered\nif I was going to hear about sexual abuse, a possibility consistent with soiling and fire-\nraising. However, the thought that began forming in my mind was that we were dealing\nwith abusive experiences in the parental generation.\nUnusually, Nicky\u2019s mother brought him for the next session on her own. At their\nmeeting she told my colleague that she hated it when the children\u2019s father got angry\nwith the children because it reminded her of her own father and his cruel treatment of\nher. He would regularly beat her and had burned her lower body with boiling water. In\nthe meantime, in Nicky\u2019s session:\nNicky continued his drawing of \u2018the day the moon went black\u2019, less a drawing\nperhaps than a reconstruction. He set the paper on the desk and surrounded it\nwith the two telephones and wild animals from his box, a tiger, polar bear and\ncrocodile. I was instructed to write a letter. Nicky stuck a piece of sellotape across\nhis picture, put glue on top of this and then put yellow felt tip on top of the glue.\n\u2018First it was white and then it was yellow,\u2019 I said. Nicky picked up what I had\nwritten and wrote a shortened version of this in telegraphese. I thought of a two- to\nthree-year-old learning to talk. I said that I was thinking about how when he was a\nbaby, what was first white, the milk from the mummy, goes inside him and helps\nto make him grow, and what is left over comes out yellow, as wee. \u2018Hm-mm\u2019, he\nsaid, \u2018Yes, that\u2019s right.\u2019 He began adding green to make grass. This did not stick.\nThe crocodile at his elbow bit the telephone wire. Manically he broke away from\nthe table, but then instructed me to write another letter. I wrote, \u2018Nicky is\nfrightened of the angry Mummy. This is like a crocodile.\u2019 I did not think that he\ncould read this but he drew a circle around \u2018angry\u2019, asked what the message read\nand seemed impressed. He picked up the toy plane, making it fly, saying this was\nhis Dad. I said he went with his Dad to get away from the Mummy when she was\nangry. Nicky said that this was right. He then made the plane land in territory full\nof wild animals. I commented on how frightening it would be landing in a place\n150 C. URWIN\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:0\n3 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nlike this, with loads of dangerous wild animals. Perhaps these were the other\nbabies. He would be very worried if he felt that there was not enough milk and he\nthought it was going to be up to him to make more. Nicky returned to his picture,\nadding some red marks to the paper. This was blood, from the teeth, the biting.\nHe put sellotape over the top of it. This was \u2018to keep the blood in\u2019. He then played\na game in which he joined up the school bus with the other cars, linking them all\ntogether. He told me that they had heard that he would be starting his new school\nbefore Christmas, and he had met his new head teacher called Philip.\nThis linking in Nicky\u2019s play reflected how he had been able to take in what I had said\nand to integrate some of his aggression. From that time there was a considerable\nsoftening in the way that Nicky\u2019s relationship with his mother was expressed in Nicky\u2019s\nplay, and in general the savagery of the policeman\/superego became less marked. There\nwas also more evidence of Nicky owning feelings and emotional states, as was illustrated\nthe following week when I gave Nicky the Christmas holiday dates.\nGloomily Nicky looked at the calendar chart I had made. He pointed to the last\nsquare on the bottom of the page, and said, \u2018That\u2019s the day I get selected,\u2019\nmeaning, to play for England. However, we both knew of the fragility of this\ndefence. Nicky started to kick the ball around. I suggested that he did not want to\nthink about the calendar because he did not like the feelings it gave him and that\nhe was angry with me for bringing this news. \u2018Nah,\u2019 he said, but then added, \u2018The\nthing is, I feel kind of embarrassed. Tomorrow we are not going to win our football\nmatch,\u2019 naming a local junior team. \u2018We\u2019re going to lose, and we haven\u2019t lost all\nseason.\u2019 I said I wondered if what he felt about getting this calendar and missing\ntwo sessions was more like being embarrassed because it was about losing\nsomething. Nicky said that was it. He spent time firing missiles at two cups but\neventually said that he would finish his drawing.\nNicky drew some squares on the picture, with small daubs of glue in the middle,\nthat were like the squares of his calendar with circles inside representing his\nsessions. He made lines with his ruler, at angles to each other. Overall, the\nimpression was of a wig-wam, breast and\/or fire. \u2018There,\u2019 he said, \u2018It\u2019s finished\nnow. It\u2019s called the \u2018\u2018Death Triangle\u2019\u2019. This is where the oil went, that made the\nfire.\u2019 I asked how the fire got started. Nicky said that it started because someone\ntook some keys. He took a car from his box and muttered about his brother. \u2018It\u2019s\ncalled the \u2018\u2018Death Triangle\u2019\u2019 and the \u2018\u2018Fire of Death\u2019\u2019.\u2019\nI commented on how the feeling of having to move out for the holiday was like\nhaving to deal with a triangle, and being excluded. Nicky was well aware that all\nthe locked cupboards in the room contained other children\u2019s boxes. Unconvin-\ncingly, he said he did not care about other children coming in because he would\nbeat them up. I asked Nicky if there had been any fires lately. With touching\nhonesty he told me that there had been. He had taken in matches and tried to light\na fire in the sink at school. It went whoosh! Nicky\u2019s eyes gleamed with an alarming\nquality of sexual excitement, aggression and something more ordinarily boyish and\nwondering. I asked why a fire in the sink? Nicky did not know, and ran his fingers\nWHAT WORKS FOR WHOM 151\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:0\n3 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\naround the taps of my sink. The room felt absolutely scorching. I was acutely\naware of his mother\u2019s recent disclosure. Nicky left to go to the toilet.\nThere are three sides to a triangle, of course, and the one that was missing at this point\nwas the father. In describing psychotherapeutic work with children who soil, Barrows\n(1996) has proposed that an unresolved Oedipal situation is a significant factor in these\ncases. Important facts about Nicky\u2019s father\u2019s past came to light in the next two weeks.\nThe move to the new school went considerably better than Nicky and his parents had\nexpected. I was due to see his parents for a review appointment. Mysteriously, though,\nthey did not turn up. At his next session:\nNicky was very subdued. He was finding it difficult to do history at school. He was\nsupposed to know about kings and queens, and about what happened in England\nin 1500. \u2018How am I supposed to know? I wasn\u2019t even alive then!\u2019 I asked him how\nanyone could know. He said he thought their parents might tell them. And their\nparents might tell them, or their grandparents. His grandfather was about 100.\nThen very sadly, and completely convincingly, he told me that his grandfather had\ndied at the beginning of the week. This of course explained the parents missing the\nappointment.\nMy colleague established in her next meeting with the parents that the parents had\nforgotten the appointment. There had in fact been no recent deaths in the family. But\nNicky\u2019s paternal grandfather died when Nicky\u2019s father was nine years old, Nicky\u2019s\ncurrent age. Nicky\u2019s grandmother married again several years later. Nicky\u2019s father felt his\nrelationship with his own father was a good one, as was his relationship with his\nstepfather. They did not know if Nicky knew of his natural grandfather\u2019s death.\nThe missed review appointment was held in the following term. Nicky\u2019s parents\ndescribed a child who they felt was calmer, much happier and able to be part of the\nfamily. Nicky did not shout at them or answer back or have tantrums as he used to,\nbecause he seemed to understand and accept more what was wanted. He was more\nthoughtful about other people and asked more questions. Nicky was coming home from\nschool with merits for good behaviour and was pleased to tell his parents this. He was\ndoing his homework and sticking at it. The two brothers would now play together for\nlimited periods. From being a boy with no friends, Nicky had made new friends in the\nneighbourhood and was trusted out. Soiling remained a problem area. It had appeared\nto be under control towards the end of the previous term, but to come apart again\nduring the holidays. It had improved again by half term.\nAt the end of the first year, although soiling remained a problem, recurring especially\nwith separations and times of stress in the family, Nicky\u2019s developments were being\nsustained, with a total HETA score of 14. The family were keen to make a commitment\nto a further year of psychotherapy. During this year I saw more resistance coming from\nNicky, more anger in the sessions and more of what his parents called \u2018attitude\u2019, but\ninterestingly improvements in the soiling were reported during the course of the year.\nThe psychotherapy was continued for one further term to support a successful transfer\nto mainstream secondary school.\n152 C. URWIN\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:0\n3 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nDiscussion\nNicky\u2019s development through psychotherapy would not have been predicted by\noutcome research evidence, which on the whole does not give an optimistic picture\nfor psychotherapy in cases of conduct disorder (Fonagy et al., 2002). This case is also\na good example of a point Margaret Rustin (2000) has made \u2013 that many children\nreferred for psychotherapy nowadays must deal with the impact of internalising the\nconsequences of difficulties their parents have experienced, as well as their own\nproblems. This is one reason why the link between the child work and the parent\nwork is so important.\nA recent review by Elliot et al. (1999) outlines basic principles of good qualitative\nresearch:\n[Qualitative research aims to] understand and represent the experiences and actions\nof people as they encounter, engage, and live through situations. In qualitative\nresearch, the researcher attempts to develop understandings of the phenomena\nunder study, based as much as possible on the perspective of those being studied.\nQualitative researchers accept that it is impossible to set aside one\u2019s own\nperspective totally (and do not claim to). Nevertheless, they believe that their self\nreflective attempts to \u2018bracket\u2019 existing theory and their own values allow them to\nunderstand and represent their informants\u2019 experiences and actions more\nadequately than would otherwise be possible.\n(Elliot et al., 1999: 216)\nThey go on to define specific criteria. These include: owning one\u2019s own perspective \u2013\nthat is, making clear the personal, intellectual and professional allegiances of the\ninvestigators; the grounding of emerging hypotheses in examples; provision of credibility\nchecks, such as triangulation; and coherence. \u2018Through these processes, the results of\nseveral different forms of data and of analysis are drawn together into a net of meaning\nthat has structural strength\u2019 (Leuzinger-Bohleber and Target, 2002: 5).\nThe work I have described is not research; I have described an evaluation framework\nintroduced under audit as part of routine monitoring. Nevertheless, I think that it is\nclear that we have followed many of these guiding principles. It is therefore possible\nthat, with further development \u2013 including, for example, working with transcripts of\nassessment sessions and\/or the feedback meetings \u2013 the framework could be used in\nresearch comparing different groups, in exploring processes of change or in illuminating\npsychodynamic aspects of different psychopathologies, as well as in research concerned\nmore specifically with outcomes of psychotherapy intervention.\nAs part of the audit process, modifications are still being developed. For example,\nadaptations are required with adolescents; parents and the adolescent are both present in\nthe feedback meeting. It may be inappropriate to give feedback on the adolescent\u2019s\ninteraction with the therapist. Here Section 2, outlining the psychotherapist\u2019s hopes and\nexpectations for treatment, is completed separately, involving the young person only in a\ngeneral way. For looked-after children, the HETA record is filled in with the foster\ncarers at a meeting ideally including the child\u2019s social worker.\nWHAT WORKS FOR WHOM 153\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:0\n3 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nMany of the 15 children\u2019s psychotherapies are still ongoing. It is therefore too soon to\nask parents to comment on their experiences of their involvement with psychotherapy\nand the approach. However, it has been possible to ask the psychotherapists and the\nreferrers.\nFor psychotherapists, a major anxiety about this approach must be that establishing\nexpectations renders the therapeutic process too goal-orientated, cutting across the\nprerequisite to foster a therapeutic stance freed from pressure of \u2018memory and desire\u2019, in\nthe sense described by Bion (1970). It is partly to counteract this that we advocate\nkeeping the HETA record in the filing cabinet rather than reviewing it frequently, and\nnot scoring it with parents until the end of the first year. Another concern might be that,\nrather than telling us anything new, the method merely reveals what we know already\nfrom experience and good clinical practice. This may be true, but the point is to find a\nway of communicating it to others. Correia and Nathanson (2005) used the HETA\nrecord and found it valuable in enhancing the psychotherapeutic process and as a\nlearning experience. A major benefit for the psychotherapist is that the framework\nencourages one to be more rigorous in thinking about \u2018Why psychotherapy?\u2019 and to\ndevelop more precise and richer formulations. Insofar as these can be checked against\nemerging material and modified in the light of experience, it is an aid to thinking about\npsychotherapeutic and developmental processes. Furthermore, something powerful and\ninteresting happens when experience with individual cases can be observed as re-\noccurring across members of a group.\nAs far as referrers are concerned, feedback from colleagues in the multidisciplinary\nteam has been positive, in general stressing the value of bringing together the\npsychotherapy and the parent work. The referral form, for example:\nis very useful because it makes me ask why I want the (psychotherapy) service now,\nand what realistically I hope it could achieve; it helps me think about how to orient\nthe family to the commitment to psychotherapy, and to prepare for a change of\ngear in my work with the parents.\nOf the HETA record, one referrer commented:\nI think parents like it because it makes what could be mysterious and subject to all\nkinds of fantasies more accessible. . .. It puts a framework around the work \u2013 we\nhave a sense that we are all, parents and therapists, in this together. The parents\nfeel that the psychotherapist is taking on board their concerns. . .. It introduces a\nlevel of participation into the treatment process that other disciplines would do\nwell to emulate.\nTime will tell whether we can continue to maintain these positive developments.\nThe Tavistock Centre\n120 Belsize Lane\nLondon NW3 5BA\nUK\ne-mail: curwin@tavi-port.nhs.uk\n154 C.
