The neuroendocrine, physiological and behavioural alterations that comprise the \nstress response are considered to be compensatory or adaptative mechanisms that allow the \nfish to cope with stressors in order to maintain homeostasis and ultimately to survive. Thus, \nthe stress response is essentially beneficial to the fish in the short-term. However, if the \nintensity of the stressor(s) is overly severe or exposure to the stressor(s) is prolonged, the \nstress response may lose its adaptative value and become maladaptive and detrimental to the \nfish\u2019s health and well-being (reviewed by Barton and Iwama, 1991; Wendelaar Bonga, 1997; \nBarton, 2002).   \nThe physiological  stress response has been separated into primary and secondary elements: \nprimary responses comprise the initial neuroeondocrine changes including the release of \ncatecholamines by the chromaffin tissue and the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-\ninterrenal axis resulting in the release of corticosteroids; secondary responses are exemplified \nby the manifold immediate actions of these hormones at blood and tissue levels, which \ninclude effects on metabolism, respiration, acid-base status, hydromineral balance, immune \nfunction and cellular function. Additionally, tertiary responses, which include adverse \nalterations at the level of the whole animal and even populations have also been defined and \ninclude changes in peformance factors such as growth, disease resistance, and behaviour \n(Pickering, 1981; Pickering and Pottinger, 1995; Iwama et al., 1997; Mommsen et al., 1999). \nHowever, this rather rigid classification does not reflect the complexity and the flexibility of \nstress responses in fish which may vary according to the duration, intensity and context of the \nstressor(s). Currently, knowledge about the physiological response of fish to stress is related \nto the primary elements of the neuroendocrine cascade of the brain-chromaffin and \n 4\nhypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis and their subsequent secondary effects. A limited \nrange of species has been studied in detail and much of the research is focused on important \naquaculture species. Furthermore, until recently, few studies evaluated the effects of \nenvironmental perturbations related to natural or anthropogenic stressors, particularly water-\nborne toxic chemicals (Barton, 2002). Due to the intimate contact between fish and their \nenvironment and the presence of a large variety of perceptive mechanisms at the level of the \nintegument, these toxic pollutants have profound effects via both direct toxic effects and \nnonspecific stress responses (Wendelaar Bonga, 1997). \nAlthough stress responses in fish have been extensively studied at the effector level of \nhormones, receptors, enzymes and metabolites, few studies have examined the molecular \nmechanisms that underly the physiology of the stress response and our undertsanding of these \nunderpinning mechanisms is fragmentary. While the analysis of candidate genes has provided \nuseful new information, genomic screening approaches using microarray technology have \nonly recently been applied to the study of stress responses in fish. These new screening \nmethods potentially provide a system-wide assessment of stress-induced alterations in gene \ntranscription which should not only generate overviews of the biological pathways and \nprocesses involved in the stress response but also provide the means to identify new candidate \ngenes (Cossins et al., 2006). These strategies are based on the assumption that data generated \nby a genomic approach provides a more comprehensive view of the complexity of the \nresponses to stressors. Initially the objective of the present review was to identify both \nstressor-specific and stressor-non-specific molecular markers by meta-analysis of published \nstudies. However, it became evident on reviewing the literature that such goal was unrealistic \nas the stressors employed in published studies are varied in nature or intensity, a range of fish \nspecies has been employed and the functional genomic tools used also differ. These \ninconsistencies between studies are compounded by shortcomings in the quality and extent of \n 5\nEST collections employed. In this context, it is inappropriate to carry out meta-analysis of \nfunctional genomics data on stress responses in fish and instead the present review will \nconsider the contribution of genomic approaches to understanding stress responses in fish. \nThe effect of abiotic and biotic stressors related to aquaculture practices will be reviewed as \nwill genomic studies of the physiological responses to other environmental challenges in both \naquaculture species and model species such as zebrafish (Danio rerio) or medaka (Oryzias \nlatipes). \n \nGENOMIC RESPONSES TO MODEL AQUACULTURE STRESSORS  \nFish in aquaculture are frequently exposed to a range of \u201cunnatural\u201d stressors which are \nrelated to rearing practices. These include overcrowding, handling and transport. Study of the \neffects of such stressors in aquaculture fish species has led to an abundant literature with \nmany studies focused on endocrine responses and metabolic adjustement at the level of tissue \nand plasma (Mommsen et al., 1999). In most of these studies, exposure to stressors was \ncarried out using standardized protocols which impose acute or chronic handling stress and\/or \nconfinement. Activation of the HPI axis is one of the major endocrine responses to such \nstressors and administration of cortisol has often been used to simulate stress situations and \nfurther investigate the physiological consequence of HPI activation (Barton, 2002). The \napplication of microarray technology has allowed the specific modifications of the \ntranscriptome in response to confinement\/handling stress in fish to be studied in detail. \nAt this stage, presenting a comprehensive synthesis of the results of the first genomic studies \nis difficult as although most of the studies have been carried out in rainbow trout \n(Oncorhynchus mykiss), the protocols for stress exposure differ between studies and include \nsingle or repeated episodes of acute stress with or without recovery, or chronic stress \nexposure.  Moreover, transcriptome analysis was carried out in different tissues in the \n 6\ndifferent studies and in only one study was the gene expression profile compared in two \ntissues. Finally, cortisol administration studies which aim to mimic aspects of the secondary \nstress responses have so far only been carried out in a limited number of situations, i.e. in vivo \non seabream kidney or in vitro on trout hepatocyte cells in primary culture. Despite these \nlimitations it is possible to draw a number of conclusions from transcriptomic analyses. \n\u2022 As expected, all transcriptomic analysis led to identification of a complex network of \ngenes whose expression is modified after exposure to handling or confinement stress. \nThus, when searching for enriched Gene Ontology (GO) functional categories in the list \nof differentially expressed genes in trout exposed to repeated acute netting stress, \nKrasnov et al. (2005a) found alterations in functional classes such as binding and \ntransport of metal ions, chaperone and heat shock proteins, cytoskeleton and microtubules \nand a number of signaling pathways in the brain, whereas in the kidney GO classes such \nas mitochondrion, extracellular structures and peptidases were highlighted. A similar \nanalysis was also carried out with the head-kidney of trout exposed to a confinement \nstressor and revealed changes in biological functions such as protein turn-over, energy \ndemand, steroidogenesis, immune response, detoxification, oxygen transport, cellular \nstructure, electron transport chain, signal transduction, and ion transport (Le Borgne G. \nand P. Prunet. unpublished data). Although no GO analysis was conducted, studies on the \neffect of an acute stressor on the trout liver transcriptome also indicated significant \nchanges in expression of genes involved in different biological functions: These included \ninflammation (acute phase proteins; Cairns et al., 2007), gluconeogenesis and \nglycogenolysis (Wiseman et al., 2007; Momoda et al., 2007), energy metabolism \n(Wiseman et al., 2007), proteins involved in protein degradation (Wiseman et al., 2007) \nand the immune response (Wiseman et al., 2007; Momoda et al., 2007). Similar \ncomplexity was apparent in trout hepatocytes treated with cortisol in vitro and genes with \n 7\nmodified expression included those involved in intermediate metabolism, cellular stress \nresponse, reproduction and xenobiotic metabolism (Aluru et al., 2007).   \n\u2022 Interestingly, transcriptome analysis in tissue from fish exposed to a confinement or \nhandling stressor revealed the involvement of cellular mechanisms not previously \nidentified in this context. Thus, a transient change in immune-related genes in response to \nacute stress was observed in trout liver (Wiseman et al., 2007; Momoda et al., 2007; Le \nBorgne G. and P. Prunet. unpublished data). Exposure to an acute and chronic stressors \nalso led to an increase in haptoglobin expression in trout liver and head-kidney, a \nprominent acute phase protein which has never previously been associated in fish with \nnon-immunological stressors (Cairns et al., 2007; Le Borgne G. and P. Prunet. \nunpublished data). Another interesting finding arising from transcriptome analysis is the \npossible involvement in the stress response of  hormones not previously associated with \nthis process in fish, such as insulin-like growth factors, testosterone and insulin in the \nliver (Wiseman et al., 2007) and in the head-kidney, prolactin, growth hormone and \nsomatolactin (Le Borgne G. and P. Prunet. unpublished data).  \n\u2022 Transcriptome analysis is uniquely suited to the identification of potential new \nbiomarkers of acute and chronic stress. Such information could be found in the \ntranscriptome analysis of acute stress experiments (Krasnov et al., 2005a; Momoda et al., \n2007; Wiseman et al., 2007; Sarropoulou et al., 2005) but appears more clearly in the \nlarge time-course analysis of confinement stress carried out on trout by Cairns et al. \n(2007) and Le Le Borgne G. and P. Prunet. (unpublished data). In rainbow trout exposed \nto an ongoing chronic stressor, and using a sampling protocol which ranged from 2 hours \nto 21 days of confinement stress, these studies identified genes in the liver and head-\nkidney whose expression showed short-term or long-term modification which offer \npotential as markers of acute\/chronic stress. The potential importance of reliable stress \n 8\nmarkers warrants further investigations aimed at validating the utility of these candidate \ngenes as markers of acute\/chronic stress. \n \nDespite the wealth of transcriptomic analysis represented by these studies, we are far from \nachieving a comprehensive view of the molecular mechanisms involved in the response of \nfish to the model stressors, handling and confinement. This goal requires further studies. In \nparticular, more accurate statistical analysis should be conducted on large EST collections in \norder to have a wider view of gene expression changes in target cells. Recent progress in the \nconstruction of large EST collections for several aquaculture species and the development of \nlarge size oligo microarrays should make such analysis possible in the very near future (see \nCanario et al., present issue). In addition, an improvement in our understanding of the \ncomplexity of the stress response to standardised model stressors such as confinement will \nalso come from transcriptome analysis of target cells in primary culture exposed to \ncorticosteroid or catecholamines, the major endocrine factors which regulate many of the \nsecondary stress responses.  \n \nEFFECTS OF AGONISTIC BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIAL STRESS \nThe formation of dominance hierarchies due to competition for limited resources, such as \nfood and foraging sites is evident in several teleost species, including salmonids, in the wild \nas well as in captivity (Yamagishi, 1962; Symons, 1968; Jenkins, 1969; Abbott and Dill, \n1989; Metcalfe et al. 1989; Nakano, 1995).  Socially subordinate fish experience unreliable \naccess to food, a general lack of control and predictability, and a constant threat of aggression \nfrom dominants (Zyan, 1991; Winberg and Lepage, 1998). Thus social subordination is \nstressful and characterised by elevated levels of plasma cortisol and brain serotonin \nmetabolism together with other indicators of sustained stress. In the wild, social status is a \n 9\nmajor determinant of life history traits, reproductive success and survival in many species \n(reviewed in Johnsson et al., 2006). In aquaculture regimes, although social hierarchies \nbecome less distinct with increasing stocking densities (J\u00f8rgensen et al., 1993; Jobling and \nBaardvik, 1994) growth depensation is a common phenomenon, and fish that grow poorly \nmay do so because they are socially subordinate (Cubitt et al., 2008). In addition to economic \nissues, the chronic stress experienced by subordinate fish is a serious issue with regard to fish \nwelfare in commercial aquaculture.  \nDifferences in behaviour, hormone levels and neurochemistry associated with social status in \nvarious teleosts appear mainly as a result of chronic stress in subordinates (reviewed in \nSummers and Winberg, 2006). However, knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying \nsocial stress and complex social behaviors, such as aggression and the formation of \ndominance hierarchies, is limited. The fact that the social status of an animal might change \nduring its life time suggests that regulation of gene activity is an important mechanisms for \nthe control of agonistic behaviour. The complexity of behavioural traits suggests that they are \npolygenic and that gene interactions are fundamental. Thus, genomic multigene approaches \nhold great potential to reveal these complex networks of interrelated mechanisms.  \nSneddon et al. (2005) applied a microarray approach to study gene expression profiles in the \nbrain of rainbow trout of divergent social status. The results show that the expression of as \nmany as 1165 genes differed between fish of different social status. Given the link between \nsocial rank and food intake, feed conversion ratio and growth rate it is no surprise that the \nmajority of genes found to be differentially expressed in the study by Sneddon et al. (2005) \nwere related to processes like protein turnover and metabolism. However, a number of genes \nrelated to stress responses and behaviour which could serve as candidates for future studies \nwere also identified (Sneddon et al., 2005). Aubin-Horth et al. (2007) used a DNA microarray \nconstructed from a African cichlid (Astatotilapia burtoni) brain-specific cDNA library (Renn \n 10\net al., 2004) to study brain gene expression profiles in dominant male and female breeders and \nsubordinate male and female helpers of the African cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher. In this \nstudy four genes were found to vary between dominant and subordinate fish independent of \nsex. One of these genes was arginine vasotocin (AVT), which could be considered a candidate \ngene as it has been linked to aggressive (dominance, territoriality) and reproductive behaviors \nin fish and birds and to social affiliation and partner preference in mammals (Goodson and \nBass, 2001), whereas the others genes are related to processes like neural growth, ageing and \nimmune reactions, all of which are biological functions not usually associated with social \nbehaviour (Aubin-Horth et al., 2007). \n \nGENOMIC ANALYSIS OF STRESS RESPONSES AND ACCLIMATION TO \nENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES \nAlterations in almost all factors related to physical characteristics of the aquatic environment \n(temperature, salinity, turbidity, pH, oxygen level, xenobiotics.) can result in an integrated \nstress response in fish if the changes are sudden or sufficiently extreme (Wendelaar Bonga et \nal., 1997; Barton, 2002). Over the past 30 years, studies of the stress response caused by \nenvironmental challenges in fish have focused on the physiological responses for the \nmaintenance of homeostasis and their endocrine regulation. Much less information has been \nproduced on the stress responses that occur at the cellular levels, and the relationships \nbetween known molecular mechanisms involved in these stress responses are still poorly \nunderstood. In addition to defensive, or immediately adaptive responses that occur at the \ncellular level in reaction to an environmental challenge, a second type of adaptation cellular \nresponse has been described, which restores cellular homeostasis when changes in \nenvironmental conditions become permanent (K\u00fcltz, 2005). The recently published genomic \nstudies related to environmental stress and acclimation offer new insights into the role of the \n 11\ntranscriptome and proteome in the regulation of physiological responses to environmental \nchallenge. \nEffects of temperature change \nBecause they are poikilotherms, fish experience the full effects of fluctuations in \nenvironmental temperature. Moreover, many fish species experience large diurnal and \nseasonal temperature changes which make their physiological responses a favoured subject \nfor studying the mechanisms that underly environmentally induced physiological plasticity \n(Cossins et al., 2006). Genomic techniques offer the opportunity to identify new mechanisms \nunderpinning these biological processes, and to investigate in greater detail those that are \nalready documented. Although several of the studies described here were designed to \ninvestigate molecular mechanisms of acclimation to naturally occurring temperature regimes, \nthe results provide relevant insight into the mechanisms employed by fish exposed to stressful \ntemperature change. A time-course analysis of transcript expression in seven tissues was \ncarried out in carp (Cyprinus carpio) exposed to graded cooling regimes (Gracey et al., 2004; \nGracey, 2007) and showed that a large set of genes (3,400 unique cDNA) were affected by \ncold acclimation. The complexity of the transcriptome responses led the authors to focus on \nthe detection of biological themes within the expression data and to interpret the functional \nrole of the complex changes in gene expression. Thus, by unbiaised profiling of gene \nontologies using GO terms, Gracey et al. (2004) were able to visualize the major biological \nfunctions corresponding to genes showing significant up- or down-regulation. This study \nhighlighted the most distinctive features of adjustment to cold in each of the nine tissues. For \nexample, this thematic analysis clearly showed the importance of lipid for proper function of \nthe central nervous system and also suggested a specific role for genes involved in protein \nfolding during cold acclimation. Finally, the study revealed a range of genes linked to \n 12\nthermotolerance and highlighted the complexity of the molecular responses to temperature \nacclimation. \nBased on the transcriptome analysis (Gracey et al., 2004) which suggested that carp muscle \nresponded to cold acclimation by reductively remodelling its contractile apparatus, McLean et \nal. (2007) pursued that question and carried out a proteomic analysis of the carp muscle using \nthe same temperature challenge protocol. They showed that chronic exposure of carp to low \ntemperature produced subtle changes in the pattern of soluble proteins most notably with the \nappearance of a multiple breakdown fragments of the creatine kinase isoforms. This \nobservation is consistent with a cold-induced enhancement of proteolysis and with a \nremodelling of the cellular creatine kinase expression shown in the previous study.    \nAnother original approach was also developed by Podrabsky and Somero (2004) when \nanalyzing the transcriptome in killifish (Austrofundulus limnaeus) acclimated to 3 constant \ntemperatures ranging between 20\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C or exposed to daily fluctuations of temperature \nbetween 20\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. These situations correspond to natural temperatures to which this \nfish species is exposed in the environment. Gene expression analysis in liver revealed major \ndifferences between these various situations although fewer genes showing significantly \ndifferent expression were observed in this study compared to that of Gracey et al. (2004). \nHowever, numerous new hypotheses related to effects of temperature acclimation on cellular \npathways were generated by the study, the most notable being the possibility that the high \nmobility group B1 (HMGB1) may act as a compensatory modulator of transcription in \nresponse to temperature and thus act as a temperature sensor for global gene expression. \nShort-term cellular responses to heat stress have also been analyzed by genomic approaches \n(Buckley et al., 2006): to mimick an ecologically relevant temperature change gobies \n(Gillichthys mirabilis) were exposed to a thermal regime (18\u00b0C to 32\u00b0C over 3 hours, 32\u00b0C \nfor 2 hours and back to 18\u00b0C over 3 hours) and gene profile analysis was carried out in gill \n 13\nand white muscle. In common with previous studies, such analysis revealed both expected and \nunexpected changes in gene expression. A GO analysis allowed the authors to groups \nchanging genes within 14 different biological processes covering many cellular mechanisms. \nAmong the most inducible set of genes were those of the molecular chaperones including the \nheat shock proteins. Interestingly, this study also examined the correlation between gene \nexpression and the corresponding protein levels measured in gill or muscle. In every case, an \ninduction in mRNA production was correlated with an increase in protein concentration, \nalthough relative timing and magnitude of transcript levels versus that of protein varied from \ngene to gene. Finally, it is interesting to note that this study revealed fewer genes with a \nsignificant response to temperature changes than the study of Gracey et al. (2004). Buckley et \nal. suggested that the difference in findings may stem from the fact that their study \ncorresponded to an acute temperature stressor occuring over a few hours whereas Gracey et \nal. (2004) analyzed an acclimation process which developed over the course of 22 days. These \nstudies probably correspond to the two-stage stress response defined by K\u00fcltz (2005), i.e. for \nthe study by Buckley et al. (2006), an early reaction to environmmental stress, also referred to \nas the \u2018cellular stress response\u2019 and for the study by Gracey et al. (2004), a longer term \nresponse also called the \u2018cellular homeostatic response\u2019. The changes in gene expression that \nunderpin the compensatory adjustments during a longer-term acclimation may be more \nextensive than those associated with the immediate damage prevention which occurs during \nan early reaction to stressors. \nAt this stage, it is still difficult to establish a complete overview of the molecular mechanisms \nwhich underpin the response to temperature stress and acclimation although significant \nprogress has recently been made. A transcriptomic analysis alone may not easily identify the \nkey biological process involved in temperature effects and complementary functional analysis \nis also required. Morever, differences between the conditions under which related studies \n 14\nwere undertaken also introduces uncertainty. For example, whereas gene expression profiling \nin zebrafish clearly identifies oxidative stress as a principal biological theme affected by a \nyear-long 10\u00b0C reduction in water temperature, oxidative damage as assessed by three widely \nused molecular markers was not modified by temperature reduction (Malek et al., 2004). It is \ntherefore unclear whether the different results in obtained in response to changes in \ntemperature reflect the different experimental conditions, or suggests a more complex \nregulation of the process than anticipated. \nEffects of hypoxia \nHypoxia is an important stress factor for all fish species and was among the first stressors to \nbe analyzed using a genomic approach. An extended transcriptome analysis carried out in the \nliver and muscle of adult gobies (Gillichthys mirabilis; Gracey et al., 2001) exposed to \nhypoxia during 6 days led the authors to derive a coherent view of the mechanisms promoting \nsurvival under hypoxic conditions: first, a rapid  shut down of the major energy-requiring \nprocesses, such as protein synthesis and locomotion at the level of muscle, followed by a \nstrong induction of genes involved in anaerobic ATP production and gluconeogenesis at the \nlevel of the liver, associated with suppression of cell-growth and proliferation and with a \ndown-regulation of genes encoding protein of the translation machinery. A similar study \ncarried out in zebrafish embryos exposed to hypoxia for 24 hours also revealed down-\nregulation of genes involved in similar cellular functions such as \u2018energy consumption\u2019, \n\u2018contractile, extracellular matrix and cytosqueleton proteins\u2019, \u2018protein translation machinery\u2019, \nand \u2018cell division\u2019 (Ton et al., 2003).  In medaka exposed to short term hypoxia (4days), Ju et \nal. (2007a) carried out a microarray analysis of gene expressions in various target tissues (gill, \nliver, brain) and suggested that two biological functions, ubiqutin-proteasome and \nphosphatidylinositol pathways were significantly dysregulated. Investigation of gene \nexpression change in zebrafish exposed to long-term hypoxia led van der Meer et al. (2005) to \n 15\nsuggest that induction of genes for lysosomal lipid trafficking and degradation is a long-term \nadaptative mechanism to hypoxia.    \nBeyond an overview of the hypoxia-induced mechanism; such gene profiling analysis in \ntissue exposed to hypoxia also led to the unexpected discovery of myoglobin expression in \nnon-muscle tissues (Fraser et al., 2006). The functional genomic approach adopted in this \nstudy consistently showed an over-expression of different myoglobins in brain, liver and gill \nof carp exposed to hypoxia for 8 days. Further protein biochemistry analysis allowed the \nauthors to confirm the presence of a myoglobin protein in the liver, the level of which \nincreased following hypoxia exposure. The role of hypoxia-induced myoglobin in the liver \nmay be to facilitate oxygen delivery to this tissue and thus may account in part for the \nprofound hypoxia tolerance exhibited by carp. Moreover, a new brain-specific isoform of \nmyoglobin was also isolated but transcript levels were unaffected by hypoxia. This is a \npertinent example of how large-scale expression screening can lead to the discovery of \nunexpected gene functionality (Gracey, 2007).  \nEffects of salinity change \nAlterations in salinity constitute a classic example of the stressor as a threat to homeostasis \nand the ability of euryhaline fish to tolerate variation in salinity without compromising \nbiological processes has generated a large literature on the osmoregulatory mechanisms which \nunderpin this ability. Based on an hypothesis-driven approach related to the roles of specific \ncandidate genes or proteins, numerous studies have identified major transporters involved in \nfreshwater or seawater osmoregulation (see reviews by Evans et al., 2005; Marshall, 2002; \nHoffman et al., 2007; Hwang and Lee, 2007). However, several genomic approaches have \nrecently been developed in order to provide new information on the molecular mechanisms \ninvolved in response to salinity changes. Thus, using suppression subtractive hybridisation \n(SSH), Boutet et al. (2006) have identified 136 different cDNAs corresponding to genes \n 16\ninvolved in several major cellular physiological functions. From these potential candidate \ngenes, they confirmed by real-time PCR the regulation by salinity of several genes involved in \nosmoregulatory mechanism (Na+K+-ATPase, carbonic anhydrase, angiotensin-converting \nenzyme, claudin-3), cell-cycle regulation (secretogranin) or the immune system (nephrosin) in \ngill and intestine. \nA more extensive analysis of the transcriptome of eel transferred from freshwater to seawater \nwas carried out by Kalujnaia et al. (2007) using microarray technology. Gene expression \nprofiling in osmoregulatory tissues (gill, kidney, intestine) and in brain provided 229 different \ncDNAs of which 95 represented the sequences of known genes. These genes were classified \ninto eight different functional groups, including cellular processes such as cell protection and \nimmune system, energy metabolism, detoxification, transport function, structural proteins and \nregulation of gene transcription and translation. This study confirmed the large range of genes \nand cellular functions involved in acclimation to seawater, some of them already implicated in \nthis process but many others requiring further characterization in relation to salinity \nacclimation. \nUsing high-throughput transcriptomic and proteomic approaches, K\u00fcltz et al. (2007) \nattempted to identify the key molecular components which are associated with \nosmoregulatory function in fish. Moreover, they also applied bioinformatic analysis to \ngenerate models that incorporated biological functions, cellular pathways and molecular \nfunctions associated with osmotic stress responses. Using SSH with the gills from tilapia \n(Oreochromis mossambicus) transferred to seawater, Fiol et al. (2006a) isolated 22 full-length \ncDNA and were able to identify most of the genes. Kinetic analysis of their change in \nexpression during salinity stress indicated that most of these genes show rapid and transient \nincrease in mRNA abundance. Such rapid changes during hyperosomotic stress indicated that \nthese genes have the characteristics of immediate-early genes (IEG), as originally defined in \n 17\nneuronal tissue (Lanahan and Worley, 1998). Such genes are key regulators during \nenvironmental adaptation and control the transcriptional regulation of effector genes \nnecessary for adaptation (K\u00fcltz et al., 2007). Gene ontology analysis of the SSH genes \nindicated that the cellular functions that are targeted during osmotic stress in tilapia gill are \napoptosis, cell cycle regulation, energy metabolism, organic osmolyte accumulation, lipid \ntransport and membrane protection, modulation of actin-based cytoskeleton dynamics, control \nof mRNA and protein stability (Fiol et al., 2006a).  Studies on the immediate-early gene \nnetwork involved in tilapia osmoregulation were extended by protein quantification using \nspecific antibodies (Fiol and K\u00fcltz, 2005) and confirmed the induction of osmotic stress \ntranscription factor 1 (OSTF1) protein in tilapia gill cells after transfer from freshwater to \nseawater. Thus, these genomic studies generated information about the molecular mechanisms \nmobilized by the fish in response to an increase in salinity and which constitute the molecular \nsubstrate for the early stress response to salinity.  \nEffects of water-borne contaminants \nWater pollution arising from anthropogenic activities (e.g. low water pH, heavy metals, \norganic chemicals) can have important effects on the physiology of fish and, in addition to \ndirect toxic cellular effects, may elicit an integrated \u201cnon-specific\u201d stress response. The high \nsensitivity to environmental pollution that is exhibited by fish is a characteristic of aquatic \nanimals and is related to the intimate contact of respiratory surfaces with the medium together \nwith the large variety of perceptive mechanisms present in the fish integument (including \nlight, mechano-, temperature, electro-, and chemo-receptors). Thus, exposure to water-borne \ncontaminants leads to an increase in stress-related hormone levels and also results in damage \nat the level of the gill and skin (Wendelaar Bonga, 1997). Although many studies have been \ndevoted to the effects of pollutants on various physiological parameters in fish, in many cases \ntheir precise mechanisms of action remain to be clarified. In mammals, gene expression is a \n 18\nsensitive indicator of toxicant effects at the cellular level and this approach (termed \ntoxicogenomics) has been widely and convincingly used to study the mechanism of action of \ntoxicants and to identify a genomic signature for the identification of toxic contaminants \n(Lettieri, 2006).  Studies of the effects of environmental toxicants on gene expression using \ngenomic approaches represent a powerful tool to diagnose chemical stressors in the natural \nenvironment and to analyse the mechanism of action of such pollutants. The use of \ntranscriptomic and proteomic techniques in ecotoxicology is rather new and offers several \npotential applications, such as the study of the mode of action, the assessment of exposure to \ngiven environmental stressors, the identification of particularly sensitive subsets of ecological \npopulations, and the discovery of new biomarkers of exposure (Ju et al., 2007b; Calzolai et \nal., 2007).    \nThe first genomic studies developed in the field of ecotoxicology were used to isolate a \nlimited number of genes related to environmental stress or pollutants and then analyze their \nexpression in fish using array technology. Thus, using 110 fragments of stress-related genes \nfrom flounder (Platichthys flesus), Williams et al. (2003) compared hepatic expression of \nthese genes in fish reared in polluted and relatively non-polluted estuaries. In another study, in \nthe context of endocrine disruptive chemicals in the aquatic environment, identification of \nestrogen responsive genes in zebrafish and sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus) was \ncarried out and confirmed that estrogenic effects of various compounds can be observed even \nat low concentrations (Larkin et al., 2002; Hoyt et al., 2003). Based on their first study, Larkin \net al. (2003) created a gene array containing 30 genes from sheepshead minnow that were \npreviously identified as estrogen-responsive and used the system to screen endocrine-\ndisrupting compounds that mimic estrogens. A similar approach was also employed by Blum \net al. (2004) to identify androgen-related effects in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). \nAssociation between gene expression analysis and a standardized embryo toxicity assay using \n 19\nzebrafish (DarT test) has been used to test effects of 3,4-dichloroaniline toxicity (Voelker et \nal., 2007). In addition to molecular information suggesting the involvement of an aryl \nhydrocarbon receptor-mediated response, this approach gave differential expression responses \nat doses ten times below the concentration that elicited visible toxic effects. \nOther research groups have recently been using functional genomic technology both to (i) \nidentify novel genes to serve as biomarkers and (ii) to understand the molecular mechanisms \nresponding to toxicity. Thus, using a trout microarray comprising 1273 different genes, \ntranscriptome analysis of whole rainbow trout fry exposed to sublethal ranges of \u03b2-\nnaphthoflavone, cadmium, carbon tetrachloride or pyrene indicated increased expression of \ngenes involved in mitochondrial activities, metabolism of metal ions and protein biosynthesis \nwhereas genes related to the immune system and stress response, signal transducion and \nnucleotide metabolism were down-regulated (Koskinen et al., 2004).  A similar study was \ncarried out on the liver and kidney of juvenile trout exposed to carbon tetrachloride as a \nmodel hepatotoxic solvent and to pyrene, a model polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (Krasnov \net al., 2005b). This study, not only confirmed up-regulation of several classical markers of \nstress exposure and toxicity (e.g. HSP90, metallothionein) in both tissues, but also revealed \nincreased expression of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative \nphosphorylation, in common with the results from trout fry. Moreover, the most disruptive \neffects associated with exposure to pyrene or carbon tetrachloride was the down-regulation of \ngenes implicated in hematopoiesis and the development of immune cells, an observation also \nreported in trout fry (Koskrinen et al., 2004). Analysis of expression profiles of liver and \nkidney genes led the authors to suggest several biological processes were involved in the \nreactions to toxicity of these compounds. That functional genomic information represents an \ninteresting source of genes which could be used as biomarkers of xenobiotic effects but a \n 20\nclear picture of the molecular mechanisms which have been disrupted after xenobiotic \nexposure still await validation.  \nUsing a large collection of zebrafish oligoarrays representing ~15,000 different genes, Lam et \nal. (2006) have carried out a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome kinetics of zebrafish \nliver exposed to arsenic over a 96h period. This study identified global transcriptional changes \nand biological networks involved in arsenic-induced responses in the liver. Many \ndifferentially expressed genes were found to be involved in various biological functions \nsuggesting that damage to DNA and protein together with oxidative stress are the major \ncellular injuries caused by arsenic exposure. Interestingly, these injuries were also evident \nfrom a histopathologic study of arsenic-exposed liver and corroborated changes of expression \nfor genes associated with cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion. These results, which are \ncomparable to findings reported for mammals, led the authors to propose a model for the \narsenic-induced adaptive response of the zebrafish liver and to suggest zebrafish liver as a \ntoxicogenomic model for investigating arsenic toxicity.  \nCadmium in the aquatic environment is a contaminant of major concern and many studies \nhave examined its toxicity in fish. Using a custom 500-clone microarray, Sheader et al. (2006) \nidentified changes in several genes related to oxidative stress in flounder exposed to \ncadmium. A more comprehensive study on the pattern of gene expression in Cd-exposed fish \nwas carried out by Reynders et al. (2006) in carp liver. Various doses of waterborne and \ndietary cadmium were used in acute and subchronic exposure experiments. Expression \nanalysis of ~ 650 liver genes showed that the molecular impact of cadmium exposure is \nhighly dynamic with time and a differential response in gene expression was observed at low \ncompared to high Cd concentrations. At low Cd concentrations genes related to energy and \nlipid metabolism were modified whereas a more general stress response was demonstrated at \na high Cd concentration.  \n 21\nIn conclusion, these recent studies which have applied functional genomic methodology in \naquatic toxicology indicate that rapid progress has been made and that the initial promise of \nthese approaches has been at least partially fulfilled. Further application of these techniques \nshould have continued impact on biological discovery in aquatic toxicogenomics. \n \nGENERAL CONCLUSION \nThis overview of recent studies on functional genomic analysis of stress responses in fish has \nclearly indicated that, although application of these methodologies is presently in its infancy, \nmany novel findings have been reported and on-going research in this field should lead to \nconsiderable new knowledge among which will be indicators of stress with valuable \ndiagnostic and\/or predictive value.  Development of high-throughput methods generates large \namounts of information which can be collated at distinct levels of biological organisation and \nwill ultimately lead to new understanding of these complex biological stress responses. \nHowever, the capability of such approaches to characterize stress responses will be optimal \nonly if the following limitations can be addressed: \n \n\u2022 Although published studies using transcriptome analysis clearly confirm the complexity \nof stress responses regardless of stressor, such an approach has its limitations, particularly \nwith regards to the fact that mRNA abundance does not equate to protein function. It is \nimportant to consider other non-exclusive strategies for investigating the response of fish \nto stress, such as proteomic, genomic mutant screens or systems biology approaches \n(Feder and Walser, 2005). \n\u2022 Many published studies represent relatively superficial investigations of the problems. \nSeveral reasons explain this situation: the limited size of the available collection of ESTs \nused for microarray construction; limited time-course studies; limits to the number of \n 22\nexperimental situations and tissues analyzed; limited annotation of the isolated fish EST. \nThe development of new genomic and bioinformatic tools (see Canario et al. this issue) \nshould to a large extent address most of these questions. \n \n\u2022 Most published studies have (through necessity) used fish for which no information on \ngenetic pedigree is available. Study of cardiac metabolism and its associated \ntranscriptome in Fundulus heteroclitus clearly indicated that there are individual \nvariations in mRNA expression which explain substrate-specific cardiac metabolism \n(Crawford and Oleksiak, 2007; Oleksiak et al., 2005). As a consequence, this implies that \nanalysis of a limited number of inbred individuals could give rise to misleading \nconclusions. Consequently, it would not be surprising if similar stress situations gave rise \nto significantly different gene expression profile outcomes depending on the \ndevelopmental stage or the strain of fish used in the experimental protocol (Momoda et \nal., 2007). This is an important issue which should not be overlooked in our studies on the \ngenomics of stress in fish. \n\u2022 Finally, a precise definition of the experimental parameters, including environmental \nconditions, feeding regimes, sex and size of the fish, which apply to the stressor exposure \nexperiments is probably key to the successful analysis and interpretation of microarray \ndata related to stress exposure. GO and meta-analysis of different experiments will be \ninteresting approaches to clarify such issues. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThis review has been carried out within the project \u201cAQUAFUNC\u201d (EU-SSA-022685) with \nfinancial support from the Commission of the European Communities and summarizes the \nresults of studies largely funded by the Commission of the European Communities.
