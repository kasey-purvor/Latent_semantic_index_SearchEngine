While such temperature-related\nvulnerability has fallen steadily throughout the 20th century (Carson et al.\n2006), the continued impact of winter weather on the health of older\npeople (those aged 65 and over) is clearly reflected in UK National Health\nService (NHS) activity levels. Hospital admissions for respiratory condi-\ntions (Elliot, Cross and Fleming 2008) and ischaemic heart disease\n(McGregor 2004) increase substantially during winter months, while gen-\neral practitioner consultations for respiratory tract infections can increase\nby as much as 19 per cent for every one degree drop in mean temperature\nbelow 5x Celsius (Hajat, Kovats and Lacowycz 2007).\nThe vulnerability of older people to severe winter weather is also shown\nin \u2018excesswintermortality \u2019which, despite improvements in later-life health,\nremains a major public health issue in the UK.1 In a recent comparison of\n14 European countries covering the period 1988\u20131997, Healy (2003) found\nthe highest levels of excess winter mortality tended to be in those countries\nwhere average winter temperatures are relatively mild \u2013 the UK, Ireland,\nPortugal and Spain. UK average winter mortality during this period was\n18 per cent above the autumn\/summer level, representing 37,000 excess\ndeaths each winter, mostly among older people. Conversely, in those\nEuropean countries which experience more severe (i.e. colder) winter\nweather (e.g. Germany, Sweden), excess winter mortality is substantially\nlower (Healy 2003). Indeed, temperature emerges as the key climatic factor\nassociated with negative health outcomes in winter, with humidity, rain,\nwind and hours of sunshine only weakly, or even inversely related to excess\nwinter mortality (Aylin et al. 2001; Healy 2003).\nThis apparently paradoxical relationship between the severity of a\ncountry\u2019s winter weather (as indexed by temperature) and the magnitude\nof seasonal variations in mortality can be explained by a number of factors.\nEvidence from community-based studies, for example, shows that winter\nmortality is strongly associated with both levels of domestic heating (Aylin\net al. 2001) and protection from outdoor cold exposure (Wilkinson et al.\n2004). Pan-European analyses, however, continue to show that among the\npopulations experiencing the most severe winters, thermal insulation and\nheating indoors (e.g. Healy 2003), and outdoor protective clothing (e.g.\nDonaldson, Rintama\u00a8ki and Na\u00a8yha\u00a8 2001; Keatinge and Donaldson 1997)\ntend to be more efficient. In the UK, comparatively poor domestic build-\ning standards (Healy 2003), the absence of central heating (Aylin et al.\n2 Claire Gascoigne et al.\n2001), inappropriate outdoor clothing (Donaldson, Rintama\u00a8ki and Na\u00a8yha\u00a8\n2001) and lower levels of outdoor activity (Keatinge and Donaldson 1997)\nall contribute to excess winter mortality during very cold episodes (\u2018cold\nsnaps \u2019). Culturally, individuals appear to prepare for average, rather than\nextreme weather. Where \u2018average\u2019 winter temperatures tend towards\nthe extreme (as in Northern Europe), individuals generally seem better\nprepared. However, where average winter temperatures tend to be mild\n(e.g. as in the UK), individuals seem to be less well prepared for occasional\nepisodes of severe winter weather.\nGiven this, there would appear to be considerable scope for practical\nand behavioural interventions which could reduce older people\u2019s vulner-\nability to the effects of severe winter weather in the UK. In recent years the\nUK Met Office (a world-leading provider of environmental and weather-\nrelated services)2 has been working with NHS health-care providers\nto forecast when patients with certain chronic diseases (e.g. chronic ob-\nstructive pulmonary diseases) are more likely to be admitted to hospital\n(Met. Office 2007). These predictions of elevated risk, linked with inter-\nventions to make patients aware of actions they can take to reduce health\nrisks, aim to prevent the progression of the illness. To date this \u2018health\nforecasting\u2019 has been achieved by drawing data from three primary\nsources (respiratory infection data, current NHS workload data and\nmeteorological data) to create a sophisticated mathematical model which\nallows an extremely accurate forecast for several days ahead. Given that\nolder people are most at risk from severe winter weather, the Met. Office\nobjective has been to expand the present health forecasting model to re-\nduce excess winter mortality and morbidity in the age group more gen-\nerally. In collaboration with the national charity Help the Aged, the Met\nOffice has proposed the development of an \u2018Early Warning System\u2019\nwhich could provide older people living in the community with forecasts\nthat could then trigger appropriate adaptive responses by which to mitigate\nthe health consequences of severe weather (and significantly reduce excess\nwinter morbidity and mortality). While such systems have been developed\nfor exceptionally hot weather, particularly in the United States of America\n(see Ebi 2007), no such systems have been modelled for use in very cold\nweather.\nAs part of the development work for the \u2018Early Warning System\u2019, a\npilot study of the views and attitudes of older people and family carers\nin relation to health aspects of early warning for cold weather events was\nconducted at Loughborough University (Morgan et al. 2004). A particular\n(and unresolved) challenge identified in this research was the need to\nidentify and communicate the precise behavioural response needed to\nprevent adverse health impacts. In other words, having received a warning\nHealth risks of severe winter weather 3\nof imminent severe winter weather, what precisely should older people be\nadvised to do in order to reduce their individual health risk.\nThe programme of research presented here had two objectives : (a) to\ndevelop an evidence-based response to episodes of severe winter weather\nsuitable for presentation in booklet form and which, if appropriately\npractised, could reasonably be expected to reduce severe winter weather-\nrelated health risk among older people ; and (b) in collaboration with the\nMet Office and Help the Aged, to field trial the \u2018optimal response\u2019 advice\nbooklet within the context of a real severe winter weather episode.\nMethods\nThe project was carried out in four sequential stages (see Table 1) : Stage 1,\na systematic review of the evidence on which advice could be based; Stage\n2, a consensus development conference to assess the value and practicality\nof that advice; Stage 3, user consultations on the style and content of the\nprototype advice booklet (resulting from Stages 1 and 2) ; and Stage 4, a\nfield trial of the resulting advice booklet under real severe winter weather\nconditions. All stages of the research were approved by the Loughborough\nUniversity Research Ethics Advisory Committee.\nStage 1 : The systematic review\nThe aim of the review was to identify the scientific evidence that links\nparticular behavioural responses to severe cold weather with demonstrated\nT A B L E 1.

A total of 52 combinations of search terms (e.g. elderly, cold,\nprevention and cold-stress) were used to identify potentially relevant\npapers from various databases using Metalib (Exlibris). The search period\nwas 1945\u20132006.\nThis search of the published literature was combined with a search of\nthe unpublished \u2018grey\u2019 literature (unpublished internal reports,manuscripts\nin press or in progress and laboratory reports.). Laboratories, individuals\nand teams likely to be engaged in relevant research activities were identi-\nfied through the published literature search, the National Health Service\nResearch Directory (http:\/\/www.nrr.nhs.uk\/) and the Cochrane Library\n(http:\/\/www.nelh.nhs.uk\/cochrane.asp), and were invited to submit ma-\nterial. Once identified, all published papers and submitted material were\nread by members of the research team and retained as \u2018evidence\u2019 only if :\n(a) the material reported scientific results ; (b) the results could translate\ninto practical advice; (c) the resulting advice would be relevant to an older\nperson living at home (or the carer of an older person living at home) ; and\n(d) if the advice was adopted, it could reasonably be expected to promote\nhealth and reduce risk during severe winter weather.\nThe search identified over 800 papers in the published literature and 35\nunpublished reports in the \u2018grey\u2019 literature. Of these, a total of 56 papers\/\nreports from both searches were considered \u2018evidence\u2019 in the present\ncontext. From these a \u2018 long list \u2019 of advice, comprising single statements of\nthe required behavioural change, was compiled. This \u2018 long list \u2019 was re-\nduced by combining statements where similar or overlapping, or where\nduplicate advice was offered. This process, conducted by the research\nteam, resulted in 28 single evidence-based advice items using wording\njudged by the researchers to be appropriate for a public health infor-\nmation booklet. These 28 items are referred to as the \u2018draft items\u2019 in the\nremainder of this paper.\nStage 2 : The expert consensus development conference\nIdeally, all clinical guidelines and health interventions should be grounded\nin evidence derived from rigorously executed empirical research. In\npractice, however, \u2018 there are few areas of health care where sufficient\nresearch-based evidence exists or will ever exist \u2019 (Murphy et al. 1998: 1).\nFurthermore, just because the evidence suggests a particular intervention\nwill be effective in terms of a desired health outcome, it will not necessarily\nbe feasible to deliver or advise its use in any individual setting. The\nHealth risks of severe winter weather 5\nconsensus development approach places relevant information before\nan expert panel (often comprising scientists, clinicians, service users and\nlay members) with the aim of achieving agreement on whether proposed\nguidelines and interventions are feasible, practical and based on cred-\nible science (see Murphy et al. 1998). In the second stage of the current\nproject, the 28 \u2018draft items\u2019 from the systematic review were placed\nbefore a consensus development panel which, in addition to lay rep-\nresentation, included expertise in public health, primary care, epidemi-\nology, physiology and human thermal environments, and health\npsychology.3\nTwo weeks prior to the meeting the consensus panel members were\nprovided with the 28 draft items, together with a summary of the evidence\nunderpinning each item of advice (cross-referenced to scientific papers).\nThe consensus development panel was held on one working day and\nchaired by K.M. (am) and H.G. (pm). At the outset it was made clear\nthat the aim was to formulate items of practical advice which could\nbe delivered in booklet form to older people living at home. The panel\nconsidered and discussed each of the 28 draft items of advice in terms of :\n(a) scientific credibility (the strength of the supporting evidence) ; (b)\nduplication (where components of advice overlapped) ; (c) feasibility of\nadoption (the likelihood that the advice could be translated into prac-\ntice) ; and (d) practicality (an assessment of whether the magnitude of\nanticipated benefit was \u2018worth\u2019 the magnitude of the required behavioural\nchange).\nThe panel achieved agreement on which of the draft items could re-\nmain, which should be rejected, which should be combined or modified,\nand how the items could best be delivered. This process resulted in 22\nitems of advice (see Table 2), a title for the proposed booklet, Keeping Warm,\nStaying Healthy, and the following introductory text :\nCold weather places a strain on your heart. This is because when we are cold,\nour blood thickens and our blood pressure rises, increasing the risk of heart\nproblems or stroke. Cold weather can also increase the risk of respiratory prob-\nlems (e.g. colds and flu, chest infections and asthma). This is why it is really\nimportant to look after yourself by keeping warm in winter. In this country\nwinter weather contributes to the deaths of over 20,000 elderly people each\nyear. Many of these deaths are from heart attacks and strokes, and could have\nbeen prevented. The evidence shows that by taking the simple steps outlined in\nthis leaflet, you can maintain your health and avoid unnecessary illness this\nwinter.\nSubsequently the revised items were transferred to a \u2018mock-up\u2019 booklet\nwhich was then considered in a series of three focus groups that were\nformed by members of the intended target population.\n6 Claire Gascoigne et al.\nStage 3 : User focus groups\nGiven that the advice itself was largely derived from laboratory studies and\nhad never been presented to members of the public in the present format,\nit was considered important to ask the intended end-users (older people\nand carers of older people) to examine and discuss the material in terms of\nits : (a) accessibility (was the material in the booklet understandable?) ; (b)\nface validity (did the material in the booklet \u2018make sense \u2019 in relation to the\n\u2018Keeping Warm, Staying Healthy\u2019 title?) ; and (b) practicality (was the\nadvice offered in the booklet \u2018doable \u2019?). Consideration was also given to\nthe presentational style of the booklet. The aim was to include any\nmodifications on which there appeared to be widespread agreement,\nprovided those changes did not alter the scientific credibility of the advice.\nThe focus-group participants were recruited through advertisements\nplaced in a local newspaper. They were required to be either aged 65 or\nmore years, or the carers of older people, and able to take a taxi from their\nhome to the university. Those who contacted the project office were given\ninformation about the research and what the focus groups would entail.\nThree groups were organised: a younger (Third Age) group (eight men\nand four women; aged 64\u201376 years), an older (Fourth Age) group (two\nmen and eight women; aged 71\u201387 years), and a carers group (one man\nand nine women; aged 19\u201389 years).\nThe focus groups were conducted on the university campus, and lasted\nbetween 1.5 and two hours, with all groups being led by the same\nT A B L E 2. Summary of 22 items in the booklet following Stage 2\nSection Advice (summary only)\nAt home during\nthe day\nIdeal temperature around 21x C or 70x F; keep the heat in (reduce draughts,\nclose windows, draw curtains after dark) ; insulate home; don\u2019t wait\nuntil you feel cold before you take precautions ; wear adequate clothes indoors.\n(five items)\nAt home at night Ideal temperature around 18x C or 64x F; close bedroom window;\nkeep warm in bed; wear comfortable warm nightwear; wear dressing\ngown and slippers if you get up in the night. (five items)\nWhen outdoors\u2026 Wear hat, gloves and scarf for all excursions (however brief) outside;\navoid standing around waiting in the cold \u2013 keep moving; wear layered\nclothing (details provided) ; in severe weather, avoid going out if it\u2019s windy\nor icy. (four items)\nLooking after your\ngeneral health\nKeep active in the home; eat at least one cooked meal each day; in\ncold weather, increase calcium intake (details provided) ; maintain vitamin C\nintake; take regular warm drinks (even when not thirsty) ; consume alcohol\ncautiously when it\u2019s very cold; use extra caution when taking any sedative\nmedication (e.g. sleeping tablets, antidepressants) \u2013 if in doubt, consult your\ndoctor; get a flu jab, and enquire about a pneumonia jab. (eight items)\nHealth risks of severe winter weather 7\nmoderator (C.G.). Prior to the meeting, the participants were provided\nwith a copy of the basic draft booklet which included the proposed \u2018 intro-\nductory text \u2019 and the advice items agreed by the consensus development\npanel. The discussions were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.\nAnalysis. The primary purpose of the focus groups was to provide feedback\non the content and style of the booklet in preparation for the field trial.\nThe analysis of the transcripts therefore centred around: (a) the concept of\nthe booklet and the presentation of its key messages ; (b) the acceptability\nand credibility of the key messages ; and (c) the appearance and style of the\nbooklet. To accomplish this, the verbatim transcripts were read and re-\nread carefully and were subject to a thematic content analysis (Dey 1993;\nRitchie, Spencer and O\u2019Connor 2003). Themes and comments within and\nacross the focus groups were noted, together with suggestions for how the\nbooklet might be improved. Of necessity, a limited subset of the findings is\npresented below to illustrate the main findings from the groups.\nFocus group findings. Overall, the need for such a booklet was widely agreed.\nImportantly, while much of the advice was regarded as \u2018common sense\u2019, it\nwas not considered either patronising or condescending. The information\ncontent of the booklet was also well received, indicating an unmet need to\ninform people of the actual risks posed by winter weather. As a woman in\nthe Fourth Age group said:\nIt says here, the blood thickens when we\u2019re cold and I hadn\u2019t realised that, so\nthat\u2019s very useful to know why we do these things, you\u2019re not just being told to do\nit willy-nilly ; I like to know why and that I found useful.\nInterestingly, the degree of health risk emphasised in the booklet (see text\nabove) was not regarded as overstated or alarmist, with many participants\nsuggesting that such risks may need to be expressed even more strongly.\nRegarding style and presentation, the groups made several suggestions.\nFor example, that the print size should be large enough to be read easily,\nand that temperatures should be expressed in degrees Fahrenheit as well\nas Celsius. There was also evidence across the focus groups that partici-\npants accepted much of the advice within the booklet, as several women in\nthe Third Age Group indicated:\nF4: It\u2019s the last sentence I found interesting. So when going outdoors it\u2019s \u2026 wrap\nscarf around your\nF7: Your mouth.\nF4: I don\u2019t think we do that \u2026 unless it\u2019s really, really cold, but I can see the\nvirtue of it, because then it prevents cold air coming in.\nF5 : I think you did that years ago, put the scarf round [your mouth] when it was\nfoggy.\n8 Claire Gascoigne et al.\nHowever, not all items met with such agreement. For instance, the advice\nto keep bedroom windows closed in winter met with considerable resist-\nance in all three focus groups, with many people believing that having a\nwindow open during winter was actually beneficial to health. One man in\nthe Third Age group said:\nYou know these in the bedroom, it says keep your windows shut, that\u2019s one of the\nworst things out because people who are in a room, breathing air, causing coughs\nand you want the window open a little bit or have a \u2026 if the room\u2019s sealed, it\u2019s\nlike sleeping in a box, the colds, flu, then when you go outside, that\u2019s what causes\nthe damage.\nMuch of the resistance to advice that did occur related to cost, and in\nparticular the recommendation to keep the home at a constant 21xCelsius.\nDuring the Third Age group discussion, one man asked:\nCould I just ask about paragraph 5, it says if you don\u2019t have central heating, think\nabout getting it. You may be entitled to free installation. Brilliant. But I know\nwhat an elderly person is going to say is who\u2019s going to pay for the gas because\nthey know it\u2019s going to cost more.\nIn general, the participants reflected a sophisticated appreciation of the\nrelevant condensed evidence-based health advice, and an awareness that\nsome messages apply more to some than to others. As a woman in the\nThird Age group reasoned:\nYou\u2019re aiming at people as a general thing here, aren\u2019t you? Trying to get general\ninformation out. I mean obviously every individual knows \u2013 usually knows about\ntheir own particular health things. Things like my feet get cold or my extremities\nget cold. But that\u2019s again, a common sense thing. But if you\u2019ve given this sort of\ngeneral information then you can always \u2013 that can be a sort of base and you\nwork from there.\nModifying the booklet. Based on the focus group results, several modifications\nto the content of the booklet were made in order to address the issues that\nhad been raised. For example, because the bedroom window item elicited\nresistance across all three groups, it was felt necessary to provide a little\nmore information to support the advice. In addition, the font size was\nincreased and some items were re-phrased to make them more accessible.\nThe 22 items of advice were then assembled into a final \u2018mock-up\u2019 booklet\nusing colour formats and graphic material agreed by the full research team\nand its partners. The front cover of the booklets carried the logos of both\nthe Met. Office and Help the Aged. Two strip thermometers, showing\nCelsius and Fahrenheit scales, were included in the booklet (one for the\nbedroom and one for the living room). These booklets, which reflected\nthe scientific evidence base, the views of the consensus conference experts,\nHealth risks of severe winter weather 9\nthe views and needs of end users, and the style preferred by users and the\nresearch team, were then used in a field trial. (A PDF file of this booklet is\navailable from the first author.)\nStage 4 : the field trial\nThe final stage of the project was designed to field test the advice booklet\nunder realistic conditions among a community-based sample of volunteers\nin the target age groups, and addressed the following research questions.\nWhen used in combination with an actual severe winter weather early\nwarning, are the booklets effective in:\n1. raising awareness (and improving knowledge) of the health risks asso-\nciated with severe winter weather?\n2. changing attitudes about the importance of keeping warm during\nperiods of severe winter weather?\n3. promoting appropriate behavioural change that likely would reduce\nrisk during periods of severe winter weather?\nRecruitment. The participants were recruited through local newspaper\nadvertisements, and were required to be: over the age of 65; have access\nto a telephone; be living within 10 miles of Loughborough University ; and\navailable at home throughout the two-month \u2018standby\u2019 period. (In the\nevent, one person aged 64 years, the partner of an older volunteer, was\nadmitted into the trial). A total of 37 participants aged 64\u201383 years\n(23 female and 14 male; 24 married participants living with a partner, and\n13 living alone) agreed to take part. The majority of the participants (62%)\nlived in the town of Loughborough; 38 per cent lived locally in rural\nLeicestershire. All households except one had central heating. The ma-\njority of households were owner-occupied with only five of the participants\nliving in rented accommodation (with just one person living in rented\nsheltered housing). As is common to studies using volunteers, despite\nbroad recruitment criteria, the sample showed higher levels of mobility,\nhealth and owner-occupation than a random sample. Similarly, the very\nfrail and the very poor were under-represented, as was ethnicity (no\nmembers of ethnic minorities responded to the advertisement).\nField trial design and procedure. The field trial was designed as a two-month\nmonitoring project covering the period 1 February to 26 March 2007,\nhistorically the coldest winter months in England (Met. Office 2009).\nParticipants were initially visited at home, given the booklet (together with\nan explanation of its use) and advised that, should a period of severe winter\n10 Claire Gascoigne et al.\nweather be imminent, they would be informed by telephone by the\nproject office. At each of these home visits the value of the Keeping Warm,\nStaying Healthy booklet was emphasised at a level equivalent to a public\nservice radio or television broadcast. On each Monday throughout\nthe monitoring period, the Met. Office provided the project with email\nforecasts of \u2018normal \u2019 or \u2018elevated\u2019 health risk for the following seven\ndays. Information on any elevated health risk was then communicated\nto participants ; the core message delivered to participants was that a\ncold spell was imminent and therefore they should be referring to the\nbooklet they had been given for advice. When the health risk returned to\n\u2018normal \u2019, participants were again informed by telephone and told to\n\u2018 stand down\u2019. As soon as possible after the risk returned to normal, par-\nticipants were visited and interviewed at home. To accommodate the\npracticalities of completing 37 home interviews within a reasonable time\nframe, interviews were conducted over two separate periods of \u2018elevated\nrisk \u2019.\nTwo periods of elevated risk occurred during the study monitoring\nperiod: the first commenced on 5 February 2007; the second commenced\non 18 March 2007.\nField-trial interview procedure. The semi-structured interviews lasted between\n30 and 90 minutes, and were audio recorded. Cues were provided to\nencourage participants to address the five issues of particular interest to\nthe study: risk awareness ; attitude change; behavioural change; perceived\npracticality and feasibility of the booklet ; and potential barriers to adopt-\ning the advice contained in the booklet. A further topic for discussion\nincluded the perceived severity of the cold weather, since this is likely to\nhave determined the participants\u2019 response to the booklet. Where parti-\ncipants wished to provide their individual views on any aspect of the trial,\nthese views were recorded uninterrupted.\nAnalysis of the interview transcripts. Interview recordings were transcribed\nverbatim and analysed in two ways. Firstly, like the focus group data, all\ninterviews were read and examined for content relating to the areas of\nparticular concern in the trial : awareness, attitudes and behavioural\nchange. These elements of the interview responses were collated and\nsynthesised across the whole data set. Secondly, the transcripts were sys-\ntematically read, re-read and coded in order to identify themes or con-\ncepts following the recommended procedures for thematic analysis in\npsychological research suggested by Braun and Clarke (2006). Codes were\ncollated into potential themes, which were then reviewed and named.\nRecurring themes were then clustered under more generic themes\nHealth risks of severe winter weather 11\n(e.g. common sense ; being prepared). Given the nature of the study, it was\nconsidered important to review the whole data set and identify responses\nwhich endorsed the value of the booklet and those which did not (in a\nsimilar way to negative case analysis). All such responses contributed to the\ndevelopment of the themes.\nResults\nResults are presented to reflect the two elements of the analyses : those\nthemes which arose directly from the study questions (i.e. those relating to\nknowledge and awareness, attitude change, behavioural change, and the\nperceived practicality and feasibility of the booklet) ; and those themes\nreflecting the participants\u2019 views of the issues involved, including advice\nas common sense, and (a key theme highlighting the value of the booklet),\nreminders and reassurances. An additional theme, cued by the interviewer and\nprompted by discussion in the focus groups, concerned the perceived\nseverity of the \u2018cold snaps\u2019 that occurred during the monitored period.\nThe perception of cold severity is arguably influenced by the perception of\nweather-related risk and this theme will be considered first.\n\u2018Really \u2019 cold weather\nA general view expressed by the interviewees was that neither of the \u2018cold\nsnaps \u2019 had been particularly severe, and many said they had expected the\ncold weather to be worse than it was, in the light of their own previous\nexperience, as one woman suggested:\nWell it\u2019s difficult because \u2026 I always think of a cold snap as being like cold snaps\nthat we used to get years ago and they really were cold [laughs].\nAnd a similar point was made by another woman, who clarified why cold\nseems easier to bear now:\nAnd it didn\u2019t seem like \u2026 very bad cold weather because we remember [laughs]\nyears ago when it was extremely cold \u2026 when we didn\u2019t have central heating and\nthings like that, you know and err now, you know, it just passes over really\nwithout us bothering too much.\nNevertheless, the number of times that the temperature had fallen\nbelow freezing, the nights with an air frost, and the amount of snow and\nwind was detailed by several participants, even while they were acknowl-\nedged the relative mildness of the winter compared to winters in their\npasts.\n12 Claire Gascoigne et al.\nRisk awareness\nEvidence from the focus groups suggested that the association between\ncold weather and the increased risk of having a heart attack or stroke was\nnot common knowledge among older people and carers. Most participants\nwere aware that cold weather was associated with an increased likelihood\nof a respiratory infection and hypothermia; only five explicitly stated that\nthey were aware that cold weather represented a cardiovascular risk.\nThese low levels of awareness are illustrated by the comments from this\n67-year-old man who demonstrated his understanding of more than one\nhealth risk :\nR: I don\u2019t really think it did as a health hazard \u2013 I know of course that people\ndo \u2026 die of hypothermia \u2026 either exposed in \u2026 cold weather outside\nor \u2026 even more so, if they\u2019re immersed in cold water.\nI : Ok yep \u2026 so was that \u2026 the main risk that you felt cold weather \u2026\nposed \u2013 hypothermia?\nR: Prior to this booklet, yes \u2013 then I realised, it\u2019s not quite \u2026 it can be \u2026 slightly\nhazardous, even if not quite that extreme.\nR: Well, I know when we\u2019ve had urm \u2026 snow storms, or whatever they\u2019re\ncalled \u2026 in the Eastern side of \u2026 North America \u2026 people were going out\nand wanting to clear their cars, and some, middle-aged folks have actually\ndied of heart attack \u2013 attempting to clear the snow \u2026 and I thought that was\nbecause of they \u2026 unused to exercise.\nI : It could be the combination of those \u2013\nR: I didn\u2019t link that particularly to cold weather \u2026but of course, this booklet\nsuggests that \u2026 that could well be \u2026 contributory \u2026 cause.\nSuch examples of knowledge gain from information in the booklet were\nechoed during the interviews, for many individuals reported that it had\nhelped to raise their awareness and to think more about the risks of cold\nweather. Despite finding that the booklet appeared to raise levels of\nrisk awareness, however, some participants \u2013 including both male and\nfemale participants \u2013appeared to have difficulty recognising that these\nrisks applied to them. As a 66-year old man said:\nI\u2019m sure I will once I get older, yeah, I\u2019m sure people. \u2026 if somebody read this\nwas in their seventies or eighties they would find this very useful. \u2026 very good\nadvice.\nThe participants\u2019 perceptions of their own susceptibility, and therefore the\napplicability of the booklet, arose in many of the responses, with a tendency\nto suggest that the advice would be most useful for \u2018other people \u2019. These\n\u2018other people \u2019 who would most benefit would be \u2018older \u2019 (e.g. \u2018well into\ntheir seventies \u2019), frailer and perhaps less knowledgeable than themselves,\nHealth risks of severe winter weather 13\nas well as possibly less capable or well supported. A 74-year old woman\nsaid:\nwhat worries me if I can just say this is \u2026 the people who live on their own,\nwho haven\u2019t got anyone to advise them and that. I think this leaflet might\nbe more use to them than say a couple like us who \u2026 know these things.\nThis woman went on to specify later in the interview that it is people older\nthan herself \u2013 those who do not know the \u2018rules \u2019 of keeping warm \u2013 who\nare most in need of the advice, but several, individuals in their eighties\nmade the same points. Thus the target group for risk advice was repeatedly\ntransposed to others and away from the participants.\nAttitude change\nNotwithstanding the distancing of personal risk, participants also indicated\nthat the booklet had significant impact on attitudes towards their in-\ncreasing susceptibility and their current perception of cold weather and\nthe importance of keeping warm, regardless of their current age.\nthings that you can put up with when you\u2019re younger, I thought that was ok, you\nknow but that just [inaudible] alright, I say I felt a bit cold with the door open or\nwhatever \u2013 well I\u2019m getting old with it you know but, now I\u2019ve decided, you\nknow, it\u2019s common sense to do something about it. (F, 67 years old)\nThe attitude expressed by a number of participants was one of having to\naccept that they might need to change their behaviour, whether or not\nthey see themselves as at risk.\nAnd \u2026 you just plough on \u2026 and you think \u2018oh, so what \u2019, you know. The \u2026 the\neffect of the book is that \u2026 it does \u2026 think to yourself \u2026 \u2018oh well er \u2026 perhaps I\nought to have done that \u2013 perhaps it wouldmake a difference\u2019, you see so urm \u2026 it\npulls you up short and you, you concentrate, concentrate on it and um \u2026 well\nprobably act on it really. (M, 79 years old)\nFor a number of participants, it was clearly the booklet that had led to a\nchange in attitude:\nI knewmost of it, but urm \u2026 been naughty andnot done it you see, but reading that\nI thought yes you know,weought to keepwarmand, and erdress up. (F, 77 years old)\nThe following extract also provides another example of attitude change;\nthis couple in their late seventies had admitted to turning up the heating\nduring the first period of severely cold weather. The husband\u2019s response\nclearly suggests a change in that he now felt less reluctant to spend money\non fuel because he recognised the importance of ensuring that the house\nwas warm enough:\nR2: We put the heating up wasn\u2019t it \u2026 so it was\u2026\nI: Yeah.\n14 Claire Gascoigne et al.\nR2: But it\u2019s been colder but \u2013 this is the first time.\nR1: I\u2019d rather die warm and \u2026 poor, yeah.\nI : So it has made you sort of less reluctant to \u2026 spend the money on heating.\nR1: Yes because it was worth having.\nI : Yeah.\nR1: That\u2019s, that\u2019s really what the leaflet did actually (R1: M, 79 years old; R2: F,\n78 years old)\nSuch shifts in attitude indicate that, at least for some participants, the\nmessages provided by the booklet were influencing their choices.\nBehaviour change\nWhile there was abundant evidence of behaviour change by the field trial\nparticipants, the majority of these changes were subtle (e.g. slipping a coat\non when going outdoors to peg out washing; putting on a dressing gown\nand slippers to make a cup of tea in the morning). Nevertheless even these\nsmall changes could have potentially significant benefits in terms of health\noutcomes if they were widely practised. Some examples of behaviour\nchange involved changing or addressing personal preferences, as Mrs A\nsays :\nI don\u2019t normally have the radiator on, you know in the bedroom, because I\u2019d\nrather have a hot-water bottle and breathe in the cooler air but \u2026 no I took on\nboard what you said and I \u2026 just put my radiator on half \u2013 you know \u2013 so the\ntemperature was quite \u2026 pleasant. (F, 72 years old)\nOther changes were practical, prompted by the booklet :\nErr, not really, no because I did take on board some of the advice in the book, I\ngot urm \u2013 instead of having a hole in that door there, for the cats to get in, now\nI\u2019ve fitted a cat flap [laughs] and put sealing stuff around my front door and I\u2019ve,\nI\u2019ve put a secondary thing on the letter box. (F, 67 years old)\nAnd this was the case even where expense might be incurred:\nYou know I were reading the book and I thought well I don\u2019t really need a\ndraught excluder cos I\u2019ve got double glazing, you see, but when it was that cold\nspell I thought, well, it\u2019s not all that hot in here, and I got down and noticed there\nwas a bit of gap between the door and the, you know, carpet and I put my hand\nunder it and you could feel the cold air, and yet all the doors and windows were\nclosed but there\u2019s still cold air, you know, coming under that door and I thought\nB&Q here we come. (M, 66 years old)4\nRather than stimulating substantial or radical change, by increasing\nawareness the booklet seems to have served to prioritise or justify actions\nalready identified by the participants themselves.\nHealth risks of severe winter weather 15\nBarriers\/resistance to advice\nAnalysis of the interviews also highlighted potential barriers to the advice\nbeing adopted, often reflecting concerns about practicality or cost. One\npractical example was the recommendation to try to keep the house at an\neven daytime temperature of around 21 xC. For some, practicalities\nmade this unachievable, e.g. where people had heating only in certain\nrooms. On the other hand, notwithstanding the example above, many\nparticipants felt reluctant to maintain their home at 21x C because of\nanxiety about the additional cost, maybe because being younger, there\nwould be a longer time over which the increased expense would have\nto be borne:\nR: But also it costs money \u2026 to \u2026 to heat a house like this \u2026 so you tend to\nkeep it \u2013 well you mentioned like a heat here \u2026 like a \u2026 which I would have\nbeen \u2026 wow \u2013 if I\u2019d kept it at 21 or whatever \u2026 that\u2019s \u2026 gonna cost you a\nfortune to \u2026 for a house like this.\nI : Okay, so is that something that you think isn\u2019t really feasible \u2026 for \u2026 for\nyourself ?\nR: No. (M, 66 years old)\nAnother item of advice that attracted some resistance from participants\nconcerned the recommendation to keep the bedroom at 18x C if possible.\nInterestingly, reasons for not adopting this particular item included com-\nfort and the psychological need not to be \u2018closed in\u2019 :\nR: Yeah \u2026 tis a habit \u2013 a habit of a lifetime \u2026 my daughter\u2019s the same \u2013\nshe feels claustrophobic without a window open \u2026 it\u2019s just something\n[laughs].\nI : It\u2019s funny cos you don\u2019t feel claustrophobic in \u2026 now when you\u2019ve not got\nany windows open\u2026\nR: Yeah \u2026 just when you\u2019re sleeping \u2013 and also I think \u2013 I always think well if\nthere\u2019s \u2026 a gas leak or anything, at least one of your windows is open some-\nwhere you know \u2026 we knew some \u2013 my friend\u2019s \u2026 auntie and uncle \u2026 died\nof carbon monoxide poisoning \u2013 they sat in the room with all the doors and\nwindows closed and they\u2019d got a faulty boiler. (F, 74 years old)\nA minority view expressed by some in the field trial was that the advice in\nthe booklet came close to being \u2018nannying\u2019 or patronising, especially in\nconjunction with the various streams of advice given by health and other\nagencies :\nwell you see again that\u2019s something that I\u2019m afraid I get a little bit tired about. We\nnever used to get weather forecasts that tell you to put a coat on and told you to\nput a scarf on or be careful. (M, 73 years old)\n16 Claire Gascoigne et al.\nAdvice as common sense\nDuring the interviews, as in the focus groups, the field trial participants\nindicated that some of the advice could be construed as common sense.\nNevertheless, participants tended not to view the advice as patronising just\nbecause they felt it reflected \u2018common sense\u2019.\nR: No I think it was common sense.\nI : Common sense, yeah.\nR: Yeah \u2026 I think so \u2013 I think that \u2013 I, I didn\u2019t find anything that I thought\n\u2018well they\u2019re kind of talking down to me\u2019 \u2026 no. (M, 66 years old)\nLike the focus groups, \u2018common sense\u2019 was generally used by the majority\nof participants to mean \u2018appropriate \u2019 or \u2018 familiar \u2019 and thus acceptable;\nonly a few participants felt \u2018common sense \u2019 advice was patronising, in-\nappropriate or redundant. Even where this was the initial response (e.g. \u2018 to\nbe honest all it is is common sense\u2026 it is a little bit condescending\u2019) there\nwas a later reflection that there could be individual differences: \u2018 she said\ncommon sense, he hasn\u2019t got any\u2019.\nReminding and reassuring\nOften participants who said they were aware that cold weather was a risk\nfactor for having a heart attack, a stroke or a respiratory illness, would go\non to say that the booklet nevertheless provided them with a reminder of\nthis fact and this in itself was useful. A subtheme of reminding was being\nprepared, so that part of the process of reminding was to undertake appro-\npriate preparations for changes in conditions (as described above).\nI think its been useful because urm, we\u2019ve had such ridiculous weather with it\nbeing so mild \u2026 and I think the book, does actually remind you \u2013 don\u2019t be too,\nurm, overconfident \u2013 you still need your winter clothes you know, don\u2019t go get-\nting rid of them. (F, 77 years old)\nSimilarly, some participants pointed out that an advantage of the booklet\nwas that it reinforced existing behaviour, or existing intentions, for\nexample:\nR: Well it reinforced \u2026 it didn\u2019t say anything to me \u2018ooh I\u2019d not done that\nbefore\u2019 \u2026 but it\u2019s saying to me now \u2026 \u2018I\u2019m doing the \u2013 or we\u2019re doing the\nright sort things \u2019.\nI : Yeah \u2026 so it was reassuring.\nR: It\u2019s reassuring \u2026 yeah reassuring. (M, 66 years old)\nIn the context of reminding, there was another theme which emerged\nfrom the field trial participant\u2019s responses. This was the concept of \u2018being\nHealth risks of severe winter weather 17\nprepared\u2019 in general terms, and specifically for cold weather. Indeed when\nparticipants were asked to consider whether or not they felt the booklet\nhad missed anything out (bearing in mind that the booklet was evidence-\nbased), some proposed that there could have been more emphasis placed\non being prepared for bad weather events, as this woman suggested:\nR: I think old people, do take risks \u2026 but if you\u2019ve got enough food in I think\nthat\u2019s what you\u2019ve got to do \u2013 have enough food in.\nI : Okay so, so you don\u2019t go out in a really cold snap, and also be prepared for it\nin case you have one\u2013\nR: Urm, yes be prepared, yes. (F, 71 years old)\nGeneral discussion\nThrough Stages 1 to 3 of this project we aimed to develop an accessible,\nevidence-based public health booklet offering practical advice to reduce\nhealth risk among older people during periods of severe winter weather.\nThe result was an advice booklet with scientific content and a presen-\ntational style optimised by the contributions of clinicians, scientists and\nend users. In Stage 4 of the project, these assumptions of accessibility,\npracticality and utility were tested under conditions which simulated the\nintended use of the booklet when combined with actual severe weather\nwarnings. In this final stage the advice booklet (and severe weather\nwarnings) produced evidence of behavioural change consistent with risk\nreduction among both older people, and the care-givers of older people. In\nachieving this, it is clear that the information provided in the booklet acted\nat several different levels.\nEvidence from the field study interviews strongly supported the con-\nclusion that, among this self-selected group of older people, the booklets\nwere effective in raising awareness and improving knowledge. Only a\nminority of the participants expressed prior awareness of cardiovascular\nrisk during winter periods. The remainder clearly admitted that knowl-\nedge of this risk was something they had gained from the booklet. The\nresponses also suggested that, in general, the booklet had the useful effect\nof \u2018 reminding\u2019 people of the health risks of severe cold weather. In the\ncontext of other information provided during the field interviews, these\ntwo outcomes could have far-reaching implications should the \u2018early\nwarning programme\u2019 be adopted nationally.\nThe view expressed that hypothermia was the principal risk among\nolder people during winter conditions testifies to the success of a campaign\ncompleted during the 1970s, and clearly indicates the durability of\n18 Claire Gascoigne et al.\nmessages relating to health risks among older people arising from cold\nweather. (It was the view of the expert consensus group that hypothermia\nrisk among older people had not been emphasised in public health cam-\npaigns for over 20 years). Given this, the present booklet or an equivalent\ndocument could fulfil two important roles : (a) providing information to\nguide personal conduct (and reduce health risk) following a Met Office\nsevere winter weather warning; and (b) introducing lasting change in the\npublic perception of cold weather risk among older people. Nevertheless,\nthe applicability of the approach in bringing about change in more vul-\nnerable or hard-to-reach groups (such as the frail elderly) would need to be\naddressed in a national trial.\nResults from the field interviews also support the conclusion that\nthe booklet influenced changes in attitude among participants, though the\noperation of such change was often subtle. At its most practical, the\nbooklet appeared to change attitudes in a way that gave some participants\n\u2018permission\u2019 to behave in a manner which lowered risk during periods of\nsevere winter weather. This effect is exemplified by the man who, having\nread the booklet, decided to prioritise comfort (and lower risk) over\neconomy, expressing the view \u2018I\u2019d rather die warm and poor\u2019. On the\nother hand, some attitudes were simply reinforced by the information (and\nthe emphasis) contained in the booklet. However, this latter effect should\nnot be under-rated. To increase the strength of an attitude is effectively\nto change the likelihood that issues are considered personally relevant\neven when others are identified as being more at risk. Thus, to \u2018validate\u2019\nalready-held perceptions and opinions by an \u2018official \u2019 document can help\nto shift individuals in the direction of behaviour change.\nOne of the most unexpected outcomes of the trial was the manner in\nwhich \u2018utility \u2019 was reported in the interviews. Intended to mean \u2018 is the\nbooklet considered useful\/helpful by the interviewee for the interviewee\u2019,\nmany responses, while affirming the booklet\u2019s usefulness, identified the\nbeneficiaries of that usefulness as someone else. This, in turn, connected\nwith the more fundamental issue of personal risk perception. Many par-\nticipants did not see themselves as members of an \u2018elderly \u2019 population,\nand did not see themselves as particularly at risk. Rather, as described\nabove, they saw the value of the information provided in terms of its\nusefulness to others who were elderly and at risk, and in some cases they had\nin mind partners or friends with health problems. This type of self-\nperception has clear implications for the presentation of health in-\nformation, as Yardley et al. (2006) also pointed out. Generic references to\n\u2018older people \u2019, while seeming to target a specific demographic, may not\nactually match common self-perceptions, as the examples demonstrated.\nMinichiello, Browne and Kendig (2000) suggest that health professionals,\nHealth risks of severe winter weather 19\nin particular, take a negative view of older people and that while some\nolder people may respond by accommodating to their perception, others\nactively negotiate alternative images of ageing. Jones proposed that posi-\ntioning as \u2018older \u2019 is a discursive resource, employed according to the \u2018 local\nbusiness of the interaction\u2019 (2006: 79). This would suggest that the par-\nticipants\u2019 own continued health, and their participation in the study with\nsomething to contribute, allowed them to position themselves regardless of\nage as not \u2018old \u2019 but rather as within the category of active ageing. This\ncharacterisation echoes work by Townsend, Godfrey and Denby (2006),\nwhose findings suggest that older people identify other older people as\n\u2018 those like us \u2019 or as \u2018others \u2019 based largely on current health. Townsend,\nGodfrey and Denby (2006) describe the concept of \u2018victims\u2019 \u2013 those for\nwhom health considerations limit engagement or participation \u2013 which is\nvery much the representation of the more needy as referred to by our\nparticipants. Individuals in the Townsend, Godfrey and Denby (2006)\nstudy also described \u2018heroines \u2019, those who overcome other difficulties to\nremain cheerful. There was less mention of these doughty women in the\ninterviews or focus groups; indeed there was little clear difference between\nmen and women interviewed in our study in terms of their discussion of\nand attitudes to healthy or risky behaviours. In the light of the participants\u2019\ncomments and the need to promote healthy behaviours, as well as the\nevidence from other research on ageing, it is worth considering the in-\nclusion of appropriate images and textual cues to encourage those for\nwhom the advice is intended to recognise it as relevant.\nTwo other barriers (to adopting the advice in the booklet) which\nemerged during the field trial interviews present more of a challenge:\nconviction and cost. The first of these is primarily illustrated by the issue\nof leaving bedroom windows open, with many participants strongly\nresisting, on grounds of health and comfort, the advice to close these\nwindows. In our view, this firmly held conviction may reflect a legacy of\na pre-central heating culture when pulmonary tuberculosis was still\ndominant in the public consciousness, and \u2018 fresh air \u2019 was considered\nsalutogenic (by both the public and health-care providers), and leaving\nwindows open in unheated bedrooms would have made less of a difference\nto the resulting room temperature. Whatever the reasons behind this con-\nviction, it provides a clear example of a collision between contemporary\nhealth advice, and earlier health wisdom. Recognising the strength of\nsuch convictions, however, can help in the presentation of advice. In the\npresent example (of bedroom windows), acknowledging the existence of\ncontrary views, offering the advice as a suggestion rather than a com-\nmand, and providing some additional argument may help to carry the\npoint.\n20 Claire Gascoigne et al.\nFinally, advice to maintain temperatures throughout the house, insulate\nloft spaces, and keep central heating running overnight, while based on\nsound evidence, inevitably introduce issues of cost constraints. In design-\ning the booklet, and with advice from the consensus conference experts,\nwe were careful to avoid offering impractical advice which would be per-\nceived as unaffordable and insensitive. Nevertheless, the reference to cost\nimplicit in any reference to heating should be recognised in any similar\nundertaking.\nConclusion\nThe project achieved its objective of developing an evidence-based infor-\nmation booklet providing accessible and practical advice on health risk\nreduction during episodes of severe winter weather. The field trial, sup-\nported by three preceding stages of research, showed that such a public\nhealth information booklet, reflecting scientific evidence and best practice,\ncan improve knowledge and influence attitudes and behaviour in a man-\nner consistent with reduced health risk among older people during periods\nof severe winter weather. The involvement of older people both in the\ndevelopment of the booklet and as trial participants provided valuable\ninsights into the ways in which such information may be incorporated into\ndaily routines. It is of interest that, in both the focus groups and the trial\ninterviews, the participants, acknowledged their own age but tended to\nextend the distance between themselves and negative connotations of\nbeing \u2018old \u2019.\nRecommendations for research\nWhile the present project has demonstrated the feasibility of promoting\nevidence-based optimal health behaviours among older people during\nepisodes of severe winter weather, the findings also point up the need\nto address two further areas of research. First, more research is required\nto assess the impact of such behavioural change on morbidity, mortality\nand quality of life among older people. The possibility that successful\noutcomes may differ across subgroups of the older population should\nalso be explored. And second, the finding that some participants re-\ngarded themselves as inappropriate recipients of advice aimed at \u2018older\npeople \u2019 also deserves further attention, since it has direct implications\nfor the conduct of any public health initiative aimed at reducing personal\nrisk.\nHealth risks of severe winter weather 21\nNOTES\n1 Excess winter mortality is defined as the difference between the number of deaths\nduring the four winter months (December to March) and the average number of\ndeaths during the preceding autumn (August to November) and the following summer\n(April to July).\n2 The MetOffice, formerly The Meteorological Office, is the United Kingdom\u2019s\nnational weather service.\n3 In addition to the present authors, the consensus development conference included:\nDr Paul Wilkinson (Public and Environmental Health Research Unit, London School\nof Hygiene and Tropical Medicine), Professor George Havenith (Human Thermal\nEnvironments Laboratory, Loughborough University), Dr Ken Collins (University\nCollege London) and Mr Malcolm Mckie (Gateshead Older People\u2019s Forum).\n4 B&Q is a national chain of hardware, decorating and garden supplies supermarkets.\nReferences\nAylin, P., Morris, S., Wakefield, J., Grossinho, A., Jarup, L. and Elliot, P. 2001.\nTemperature housing deprivation and their relationship to excess winter mortality in\nGreat Britain, 1986\u20131996.
