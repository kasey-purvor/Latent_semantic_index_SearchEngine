Clinically\nsignificant anxiety and depression and self reported after\neffects assessed six weeks after colposcopy, biopsies, or\nlarge loop excision.\nResults 879 women (44%) had a normal transformation\nzone at colposcopy and had no further procedures at that\ntime. Colposcopists were less likely to classify the\ntransformation zone as abnormalwhen the allocationwas\nlarge loop excision (603 (60%) in the biopsy and selective\nrecall group; 501 (51%) in the immediate large loop\nexcision group). Of women randomised to biopsy and\nrecall, 157 (16%) required a second clinic visit for\ntreatment. Specimens from almost 60% (n=296) of\nwomen who underwent immediate large loop excision\nshowed no cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (31%;\nn=156) or showed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade\nI (28%; n=140). The percentages of women diagnosed\nwith grade II or worse up to and including the exit\nexamination were 22% (n=216) in the biopsy and recall\narm and 23% (n=228) in the immediate large loop\nexcision arm. There was no significant difference between\nthe arms in cumulative incidence of cervical\nintraepithelial neoplasia grade II or worse (adjusted\nrelative for risk large loop excision v biopsy 1.04, 95%\nconfidence interval 0.86 to 1.25) or grade III or worse\n(1.03, 0.79 to 1.34). A greater proportion of disease was\ndetected at initial investigation and less during follow-up\nand at exit in the immediate large loop excision arm, but\ntime of detection did not differ significantly between\narms. Levels of anxiety and depression and reported pain\ndid not differ between arms. Higher proportions of women\nrandomised to large loop excision reported moderate or\nmore severe bleeding and discharge.\nConclusion A policy of targeted punch biopsies with\nsubsequent treatment for cervical intraepithelial\nneoplasia grade II or III and cytological surveillance for\ngrade I or less provides the best balance betweenbenefits\nand harms for the management of women with low grade\nabnormal cytology referred for colposcopy. Immediate\nlarge loop excision results in overtreatment and more\nafter effects and should not be recommended.\nTrial Registration ISRCTN 34841617.\nINTRODUCTION\nColposcopy has a central role in the diagnostic inves-\ntigation and management of women with premalig-\nnant disease of the cervix detected by abnormal\nresults on cervical cytology in NHS cervical screening\nprogrammes.1 2 In women with low grade abnormal\ncytology (see www.cancerscreening.nhs.uk\/cervical\/)\nin recent years there has been a trend towards increas-\ning referral for colposcopy, rather than surveillance by\nrepeat cytology tests.3 This change in practice evolved\nfrom recognition that some women with low grade\nabnormal cytology have underlying high grade cervi-\ncal intraepithelial neoplasia4 and might eventually\nrequire colposcopy for persistent cytological\nabnormalities.5\nAt colposcopy, if the cervical transformation zone is\nnot normal, women can be managed by immediate\nremoval of the entire transformation zone by large\nloop excision. This strategy\u2014known as see-and-treat\n\u2014has become increasingly common in NHS cervical\nscreening programmes.6 It enables full histological\nexamination, removes any cervical intraepithelial\nCorrespondence to: L Sharp,\nNational Cancer Registry, Building\n6800, Cork Airport Business Park,\nKinsale Road, Cork, Ireland\nlinda.sharp@ncri.ie\nCite this as: BMJ 2009;339:b2548\ndoi:10.1136\/bmj.b2548\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 1 of 12\nneoplasia, and, for most women, is adequate\ntreatment.7 By avoiding the need for a return visit for\ntreatment, itminimises non-attendance and potentially\nimproves the efficiency of clinical services.8-10 Immedi-\nate large loop excision, however, also results in \u201cover-\ntreatment\u201d (that is, treatment of women without\nhistologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neo-\nplasia), the extent ofwhichmight be substantial,11 espe-\ncially among those with low grade abnormal cytology.\nOvertreatment puts women at unnecessary risk of side\neffects such as bleeding and infection.11 As the proce-\ndure can also have adverse effects on subsequent\nreproductive function,12 a more conservative manage-\nment approach might be preferable.\nPunch biopsies of the most abnormal areas directed\ncolposcopically, with recall for treatment (by excision\nor ablation) if histology confirms cervical intra-\nepithelial neoplasia, offers a more conservative\napproach. This strategy, however, also has\ndrawbacks,13 chiefly with regard to the reliability of\npunch biopsies in identifying prevalent high grade cer-\nvical intraepithelial neoplasia.14 When only a fraction\nof the transformation zone is sampled, the ability of\ncolposcopists to identify abnormality and target accu-\nrately is limited and biased to the most accessible\nareas.15 16 Small lesions, microinvasive disease, and\nglandular intraepithelial neoplasia might be missed\n(\u201cunder calling\u201d).17 Moreover, high grade disease\nmight subsequently develop in women with histologi-\ncally confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia\ngrade I who are not treated.18\nNo randomised controlled trials have evaluated\nimmediate large loop excision compared with biopsy\nand selective recall inwomenwith low grade abnormal\ncytology.Most evidence relates to histological findings\nfrom punch biopsies and large loop excisions in the\nsame women.17 19-21 Two small cross sectional studies\ncomparing women managed by biopsy and selective\nrecall with those managed by immediate large loop\nexcision found no differences in histological\noutcomes,22 23 while one study of women with high\ngrade abnormal cytology suggested immediate large\nloop excision was associated with lower levels of anxi-\nety after the intervention and higher levels of relief.24\nThere is a complex interplay between adequately\ndiagnosing and effectively treating the individual\nwoman at colposcopy, while avoiding unnecessary\ninterventions and providing an efficient clinical ser-\nvice. For the NHS cervical screening programmes\nthis translates into balancing benefits and harms,\nwhile keeping health service costs at a reasonable\nlevel.25We report results from the trial of management\nof borderline and other low grade abnormal smears\n(TOMBOLA) on the detection of cervical intra-\nepithelial neoplasia, and psychosocial and physical\nafter effects associated with immediate large loop exci-\nsion versus biopsy and selective recall for treatment.\nCost effectiveness is reported in a companion\npaper.26\nMETHODS\nThe trial involved two randomisations, the first to cyto-\nlogical surveillance or initial colposcopy and the sec-\nond, within the women assigned to colposcopy, to\nbiopsy and selective recall or immediate large loop\nexcision. Results of the first randomisation are\nreported in a companion paper.27\nParticipants and recruitment\nDetails of eligibility and recruitment, informed con-\nsent, and ethical approval are described\nelsewhere.27 28 Briefly, all participants had been called\nfor a routine cytology test as part of the NHS cervical\nscreening programmes and attended for that test in\nOctober 1999-October 2002. Eligible women were\naged 20-59, had mild dyskaryosis or borderline\nnuclear abnormalities, were not pregnant, and had\nnot had previous destructive or excisional treatment.\nProcedures and follow-up\nAt the colposcopy appointment, consenting women\nwere immediately randomised to biopsy and selective\nrecall or immediate large loop excision with a tele-\nphone service provided by the health service research\nunit of Aberdeen University. Randomisation was stra-\ntified by centre, age group, cytology grade, and high\nrisk human papillomavirus status at recruitment.\nWomen then underwent colposcopy. Colposcopists\nwere not blinded to the randomisation. Colposcopic\nexamination and description of findings followed stan-\ndard practice.29 We included women who had an ade-\nquate colposcopic examination (the whole of the\ntransformation zone and any lesions were viewed in\ntheir entirety); those with inadequate colposcopy\nwere treated according to local NHS protocols. Of\nwomen with adequate colposcopy, those with an\nabnormal transformation zone (colposcopic lesion\nwith acetowhitening with or without capillary vessel\npatterns) received the intervention assigned by rando-\nmisation while those whose transformation zone did\nnot fulfil the definition of abnormal (henceforth \u201cnor-\nmal\u201d transformation zone)were followed-up in general\npractice with cytology tests every 12 months.\nFor biopsy and selective recall, up to four targeted\npunch biopsies were taken from the most abnormal\nareas. Women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia\ngrade II or III (II\/III) on histology were recalled for\ntreatment with large loop excision. Women with no\ncervical intraepithelial neoplasia or grade I disease on\nhistology did not receive any further treatment at that\ntime and were followed-up in general practice with\ncytology tests every six months. In the other arm, the\nwhole transformation zone, including the abnormality,\nwas treated immediately by large loop excision. In\nboth arms women with histology worse than grade\nIII were treated and subsequently followed-up accord-\ning to standard practice. Follow-up after punch biop-\nsies or large loop excisionwaswith cytology tests every\nsix months in general practice. For all women, cytol-\nogy follow-up results were monitored with subsequent\naction (next recommended test date or colposcopy\nRESEARCH\npage 2 of 12 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\nreferral) based on these. If women were referred for\ncolposcopy during follow-up, they attended local col-\nposcopy clinics and were treated, if required, accord-\ning to local NHS protocols.\nAbout three years after recruitment, women were\ninvited for an exit colposcopy examination, with\nlarge loop excision if the transformation zone\nappeared abnormal; this examination was for the pur-\nposes of the trial and was over and above standard\npractice in the NHS cervical screening programmes.\nClinicians were blinded to women\u2019s cytology results\nand high risk human papillomavirus status at recruit-\nment, their randomisation arm(s), and clinical out-\ncomes (cytology and histology) since recruitment.\nParticipants\u2019medical records and hospital and pathol-\nogy databases were reviewed to ascertain any addi-\ntional procedures (cytology, colposcopy, histology,\ntreatment, or admission to hospital) during follow-up.\nColposcopy, cytology, and histology quality assurance\nColposcopistswere accredited by the British Society for\nColposcopy and Cervical Pathology. Cytopathology\nandhistopathology laboratories participated in national\nquality assurance schemes. For quality assurance pur-\nposes, one or two independent pathologists who were\nnot aware of the original histopathological results cen-\ntrally reviewed large loop excision and punch biopsy\nsamples from a random sample of 272 participants. In\n252 cases the review diagnosis was identical to the ori-\nginal diagnosis (\u03ba=0.9). Further details of quality assur-\nance exercises are reported elsewhere.2728\nSociodemographic information\nAt recruitmentwomen completed a sociodemographic\nquestionnaire.28\nClinical outcomes\nThe main clinical outcome was established a priori as\nthe cumulative incidence of cervical intraepithelial\nneoplasia grade II ormore severe disease from recruit-\nment up to and including the exit examination as this is\nthe histological threshold at which women are usually\ntreated in the NHS cervical screening programmes.\nWe also considered the subsidiary outcome of cervical\nintraepithelial neoplasia grade III or more severe dis-\nease. Eachwomanwas counted only once as a \u201ccase\u201d\u2014\nat the date of the first occurrence of cervical intra-\nepithelial neoplasia grade II or worse\u2014and was classi-\nfied according to the highest grade of histology\nreported, whether on punch biopsy or large loop exci-\nsion. Women with a normal transformation zone at\ninitial colposcopy were assumed to have no cervical\nintraepithelial neoplasia at that time.\nPsychosocial and physical morbidity\nPsychosocial sequelae were assessed throughout fol-\nlow-up and will be reported in detail elsewhere. A sub-\ngroup of women was invited to complete the hospital\nanxiety and depression scale30 six weeks after colpo-\nscopy and related interventions. This subgroup\ncomprised all women recruited from February 2001\nonwards in the colposcopy arm of the trial who con-\nsented to randomisation at the colposcopy appoint-\nment (n=989). These women were also asked, by\nmeans of a postal questionnaire administered together\nwith the six week psychosocial assessment, to provide\ninformation on any physical after effects (pain, bleed-\ning, and discharge) they had experienced. In addition,\nclinic staff recorded complications occurring during\ncolposcopy, biopsies, and large loop excision.\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were by intention to treat. To accommo-\ndate variability between participants in length of fol-\nlow-up, each woman accrued person years from the\nrandomisation date until the date of the exit appoint-\nment for those who attended and, for others, the date\nthe exit appointment was scheduled or the date they\nrequested to leave the trial, had a hysterectomy, died,\nor moved from the area.We compared the cumulative\nincidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade II\nor worse for immediate large loop excision versus\nbiopsy and selective recall using relative risks, com-\nputed by Poisson regression. Risk estimates were\nadjusted only for the randomisation stratification vari-\nables; adjustment for a range of other sociodemo-\ngraphic and lifestyle factors had little effect. To\ninvestigate heterogeneity in detection of cervical intra-\nepithelial neoplasia by the management policies, we\nrepeated analyses stratifying by age at recruitment\n(20-29, 30-59), recruitment cytology (mild dyskaryo-\nsis, borderline nuclear abnormalities), and whether\nwomen had had previous cytology showing borderline\nnuclear abnormalities.Kaplan-Meier curves examined\nthe risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade II or\nworse over time, with arms compared by the log rank\ntest. All analyses were repeated for cervical intra-\nepithelial neoplasia grade III or worse. We computed\ntwo estimates of overtreatment by a policy of immedi-\nate large loop excision11 based on outcomes after initial\ncolposcopy and large loop excision (that is, without\nfollow-up). Firstly, we used the National Cancer Insti-\ntute definition: percentage of specimens found to have\nno cervical intraepithelial neoplasia\/grade I disease,31\nand, secondly, we used the NHS cervical screening\nprogramme definition: percentage of specimens\nfound to have no cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.2\nWe used z tests to compare the proportions of\nwomen who scored \u226511 on the anxiety subscale and\n\u22658 on the depression subscale of the hospital anxiety\nand depression scale and who reported pain, bleeding,\nand discharge (any, and that rated asmoderate ormore\nsevere) at six weeks after the last procedure (whether\ncolposcopy, punch biopsies, or large loop excision).\nWilcoxon tests compared reported durations of pain,\nbleeding, and discharge.\nStatistical power\nWe estimated that about 2130 women would give 86%\npower to detect a relative risk of 1.25 in the cumulative\nincidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade II\nRESEARCH\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 3 of 12\nor worse, assuming overall cumulative incidence of\n15% (\u03b1=0.05, two sided test).\nRESULTS\nFigure 1 summarises numbers of women recruited,\nrandomised, and followed-up.

In each arm\naround 43% were aged 20-29 and 57% aged 30-59.\nSlightly over a third had mild dyskaryosis at recruit-\nment; of these, 8% had had previous cytology showing\nborderline nuclear abnormalities. Almost a quarter of\nthose with borderline nuclear abnormalities at recruit-\nment had had a previous smear with the same result.\nMost women were white and in full or part time\nemployment, and almost 20% had obtained a college\nor university degree.\nColposcopic impression and related histology: cross\nsectional results\nOverall, 44% of women had a normal transformation\nzone at colposcopy and had no further procedures at\nthat time. This percentage was higher in women who\nwere older (53% in those aged 30-59 v 34% in those\naged 20-29) or were recruited with cytology showing\nborderline nuclear abnormalities (52% v 30% of those\nwith mild dyskaryosis).\nIn comparing the trial arms, the proportion judged\nto have an abnormal transformation zone was signifi-\ncantly lower in the immediate large loop excision arm\n(51%) than the biopsy and recall arm (60%, z=5.04,\nP<0.001; table 2). Fewer women in the immediate\nlarge loop excision arm had no cervical intraepithelial\nneoplasia (16% v 27%) and grade I disease on histology\n(14% v 17%) and the frequency of cervical intra-\nepithelial neoplasia grade II or worse was slightly\nhigher in this arm (21% v 16%). Three women had dis-\neaseworse than cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade\nIII (one cervical glandular intraepithelial neoplasia\nand two squamous carcinomas (FIGO stage IA1,\nFIGO stage IB)), two of whom were in the large loop\nexcision arm.\nDiagnostic yield of immediate large loop excision\nIn the immediate large loop excision arm, 474 of the\n501 women with an abnormal transformation zone\nunderwent large loop excision (fig 1).

Thus according to the National Cancer\nInstitute\u2019s definition, 59% of womenwere overtreated;\nby the NHS cervical screening programme definition,\n31% were overtreated.\nCumulative incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia\nover three years\nThe cumulative incidence of cervical intraepithelial\nneoplasia grade II or worse was slightly higher in the\nimmediate large loop excision arm (84\/1000 person\nyears v 79\/1000), but the adjusted relative risk was\nnot significantly raised (relative risk large loop excision\nv biopsy 1.04, 0.86 to 1.25) (table 3). The rates of cer-\nvical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III or worse in\neach arm were about half those of cervical intra-\nepithelial neoplasia grade II or worse and the adjusted\nrelative risk did not differ from unity (1.03, 0.79 to\n1.34).\nThere was no difference between the policies in the\ndetection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade II\nor worse or grade III or worse over three years in sub-\ngroupsdefinedbyageorrecruitmentcytology(table 4).\nSimilarly, when we restricted the analysis to the 1637\nwomen with no previous cytology showing borderline\nnuclear abnormalities, the occurrence of cervical intra-\nepithelial neoplasia grade II or worse did not differ\nbetween the arms (adjusted relative risk 0.99, 0.81 to\n1.22; P=0.956).\nTiming of detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia\ngrade II or worse\nAlmost 90% of cases of cervical intraepithelial neopla-\nsia grade II or worse in the immediate large loop exci-\nsion arm were diagnosed as a result of the initial\ncolposcopy and any related procedures, compared\nwith 74% in the biopsy and recall arm (table 3). In\nthe biopsy and recall arm a quarter of cases were\ndetected during follow-up (15%, n=32) and at exit\n(11%, n=24), compared with 12% in the immediate\nlarge loop excision arm (8%, n=18, during follow-up;\n4%, n=8, at exit). Time of detection, however, was not\nsignificantly different between the arms (fig 2; log rank\n\u03c72 0.856, df=1, P=0.355). These patterns were the same\nwhen we repeated the analysis for cervical intra-\nepithelial neoplasia grade III or worse (Kaplan-Meier\ncurve not shown; log rank \u03c72 0.358, df=1, P=0.550).\nMorbidity\nIn the immediate large loop excision arm there were\ntwo cases of haemorrhage and seven vasovagal events\nin the clinic. In the other arm, there was one case of\nhaemorrhage and one vasovagal event after punch\nbiopsy and onewoman haemorrhaged after treatment.\nWomen\u2019s reports of pain after the initial colposcopy\nand related procedures did not differ by arm (table 5).\nAlthough the occurrence of any bleedingwas higher in\nthe biopsy and recall arm, this was of significantly\nlonger duration (P<0.001) and more likely to be mod-\nerate or more severe (P=0.022) in the immediate large\nloop excision arm. Similar findings were seen for dis-\ncharge.\nA slightly higher percentage of women in the biopsy\nand recall arm scored \u226511 on the hospital anxiety and\ndepression scale anxiety subscale six weeks after the\nprocedure, but this was not significant (P=0.203).\nThere was no significant difference in the frequency\nof depression (subscale score \u22658) by arm (P=0.239).\nDISCUSSION\nIn this randomised controlled trial comparingmanage-\nment options at colposcopy for women with low grade\nabnormal cytology, colposcopists were significantly\nless likely to classify the transformation zone as abnor-\nmal in women who were to be managed by large loop\nexcision than in those who were to be managed by\npunch biopsies. Althoughmore cervical intraepithelial\nneoplasia grade II or worse was detected initially in the\nimmediate large loop excision arm, and the incidence\nof disease during follow-up and at the exit examination\nwas higher in the biopsy and recall arm, the timing of\ndetection of disease did not differ significantly between\nBiopsy\nand recall\nImmediate large\nloop excision\nParity:\n0 419 (42) 436 (44)\n1 162 (16) 144 (15)\n\u22652 397 (40) 386 (39)\nNot stated 22 (2) 17 (2)\nCurrent contraception:\nUse of pill or other hormonal contraceptives only 395 (40) 328 (33)\nUse of barrier contraceptive only 133 (13) 144 (15)\nUse of hormonal and barrier contraceptives 33 (3) 34 (3)\nNone 436 (44) 474 (48)\nMissing 3 (0) 3 (0)\nPhysical activity:\n<1 time\/week 400 (40) 396 (40)\n1-3 times\/week 225 (23) 228 (23)\n>3 times\/week 360 (36) 346 (35)\nNot stated 15 (2) 13 (1)\nSmoking status:\nNever smoked 453 (45) 467 (48)\nFormer smoker 171 (17) 160 (16)\nCurrent smoker 367 (37) 348 (35)\nNot stated 9 (1) 8 (1)\n*Based on polymerase chain reaction analysis with GP5+\/6+ consensus primers, followed by enzyme\nimmunoassay for detection of 14 \u201chigh risk\u201d human papillomavirus types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52,\n56, 58, 59, 66, and 68).\n\u2020Includes women whose samples were inadequate for analysis (n=14) and women who did not have human\npapillomavirus test at recruitment (n=151).\n\u2021Carstairs deprivation measure based on population fifths assigned from address of residence at recruitment.\n\u00a7Black-Caribbean n=29; Black-African n=4; Black-other n=8; Indian n=8; Pakistani n=10; Bangladeshi n=2;\nChinese n=7; other ethnic group n=12.\nRESEARCH\npage 6 of 12 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\nthe arms. Thus, overall there was no significant differ-\nence in ability of the policies to detect grade II neopla-\nsia or worse over three years. This finding did not vary\nby age group or recruitment cytology. Specimens from\n28% of women who underwent immediate large loop\nexcision showed grade I neoplasia, and a further 31%\nhad no cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Of women\nmanaged by punch biopsies, 16% were recalled for\ntreatment. Higher proportions of women randomised\nto large loop excision reported moderate or more\nsevere bleeding and discharge. As no aspect of screen-\ning is without some disadvantages, the challenge in\nsynthesising these findings is that of maximising bene-\nfits while minimising harms.\nColposcopic thresholds\nThe higher percentage of women assessed as having an\nabnormal transformation zone in the biopsy and recall\narm could be a true difference or a result of variation in\ncolposcopic assessment between observers,32 33 but\nthese explanations are unlikely given that the study\nwas randomised and the randomisation was stratified\nby centre (each colposcopist worked in one centre). In\naddition, comparison of the seven trial colposcopists\nand one external colposcopist found moderate to\nhigh agreement between raters on presence of aceto-\nwhitening in colposcopic images from 124 women.\nMore plausible explanations are that colposcopists\nmight be more reluctant to do a large loop excision if\nthere is ambiguity about the normality of the transfor-\nmation zone, or if colposcopists\u2019 threshold to identify a\nrelevant lesion and perform a biopsy is lower if the\nproposed intervention is punch biopsy. As the higher\nfrequency of intervention in the biopsy and recall arm\ndid not result in significantly higher detection of high\ngrade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, this suggests\nthat the colposcopic threshold at which the decision is\nmade to undertake punch biopsy is too low.\nTargeted biopsies and missed prevalent disease\nThe concerns about the safety of a policy of biopsy and\nselective recall, in terms of missing relevant disease,\ntend to have been expressed in the context of women\nwith high grade abnormal cytology,17 in whom the\nunderlying prevalence of high grade disease would\nbe higher than in women with low grade abnormal\ncytology. In some instances where prevalent disease\nhas been missed this was probably due, at least in\npart, to inadequate biopsy practice. A trial of women\nwith low grade abnormal cytology in theUnited States,\nknown as ALTS, found that diagnostic accuracy\ndependedmore on the number of biopsies taken rather\nthan the colposcopist\u2019s experience.34 Within the cur-\nrent trial, colposcopic practice followed NHS cervical\nscreening programme guidelines,2 which recommend\na minimum of two punch biopsies; this was done in\nmore than 90% of women. Despite this, the frequency\nof cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade II or worse\n(and of grade III or worse) was still higher after the\ninitial colposcopy in the large loop excision arm, sug-\ngesting that pathologists findmorehigh gradedisease if\nthey have large loop excision samples than if they have\npunch biopsy samples.\nIf prevalent high grade diseasewasmissed inwomen\nonbiopsy and recall, wewould expectmore high grade\nlesions to be detected during follow-up and at exit\nexamination in this arm, which is what we saw. The\ndifference between arms, however, was not pro-\nnounced (3% and 2% of women on biopsy and recall\nhad cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade II or worse\nTable 2 | Colposcopic impression and histological* outcome of initial colposcopy examination and related procedures, by\ntrial arm (cross sectional analysis)\nBiopsy and recall Immediate large loop excision\nNo (% of those\nin arm)\n% of those with abnormal\ntransformation zone\nNo (% of those\nin arm)\n% of those with abnormal\ntransformation zone\nTotal women randomised 1000 (100) \u2014 983 (100) \u2014\nNormal transformation zone\u2020\u2021 397 (40) \u2014 482 (49) \u2014\nAbnormal transformation zone\u00a7\nTotal 603 (60) 100 501 (51) 100\nNo CIN 269 (27) 45 156 (16) 31\nCIN grade I 168 (17) 28 140 (14) 28\nCIN grade II or worse\u00b6 160 (16) 27 202 (21) 40\nCIN grade II 77 \u2014 100 \u2014\nCIN grade III or worse\u00b6 83 \u2014 102 \u2014\nOther** 6 (0.6) 1 3 (0.3) 0.6\nCIN=cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.\n*Represents most severe histology recorded after initial colposcopy (that is, for women in whom biopsy and large loop excision results did not\ncorrespond, most severe has been recorded).\n\u2020No abnormal transformation zone on colposcopy; women did not have any further procedures at this time.\n\u2021Biopsy and recall figure includes 396 women with normal transformation zone on initial colposcopy, plus one woman originally found to have\nabnormal transformation zone who returned for treatment and at repeat colposcopy had normal transformation zone; immediate large loop excision\nfigure includes 479 women with normal transformation zone at initial colposcopy, plus three women with abnormal transformation zone who were\nnot treated immediately and, at repeat colposcopy, were found to have normal transformation zone.\n\u00a7Abnormal transformation zone at colposcopy and women went on to receive intervention assigned by randomisation.\n\u00b6Three women had disease worse than CIN III, one in biopsy and recall arm and two in immediate large loop excision arm.\n**Includes three women with inadequate histology (biopsy and recall arm), and six with no histology (three in each arm).\nRESEARCH\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 7 of 12\ndetected during follow-up and at exit, respectively,\ncompared with 2% and 1% on immediate large loop\nexcision) and was mainly accounted for by grade II\ndisease (32\/56 were grade II in the biopsy and recall\ngroup; 15\/26were grade II in the immediate large loop\nexcision group). In addition, there was no significant\ndifference between arms in the timing of detection of\ndisease. Moreover, in each arm 15 of the cases that\noccurred during follow-up were in women with a nor-\nmal transformation zone at initial colposcopy, a few of\nwhom probably harboured lesions at recruitment that\nwere undetected at that time. As the frequency of\nmicroinvasive and invasive disease over three years\nwas low (two cases in each arm), and there was no dif-\nference in the cumulative disease incidence between\narms, these observations suggest that biopsy and recall\nis not associated with delays that increase the risk of\nhigh grade or invasive disease, at least over three\nyears. Thus although some undercalling might occur\nat the time of colposcopy, the policy is safe for theman-\nagement of women with low grade abnormal cytology\nwithin the NHS cervical screening programmes.\nOvertreatment by large loop excision and risk of high grade\ndisease in women with untreated grade I neoplasia\nDespite the higher threshold for intervention in the\nimmediate large loop excision arm, 31% of specimens\ncontained no cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. This is\nwell above the NHS cervical screening programme\nstandard (<10%) and is partly due to the trial protocol\nwhere all abnormalities were treated by large loop\nexcision; in the real world, alternatives are available.\nIn almost 30% of women who had immediate large\nloop excision, the histology indicated cervical\nintraepithelial neoplasia grade I; the proportion with\ngrade I disease was the same among women rando-\nmised to biopsy and recall who had an abnormal trans-\nformation zone. Much of the debate around the\nrelative benefits andharms of themanagement policies\nhinges onwhether grade I disease needs to be removed\nto reduce risk of subsequent high grade disease. If so,\nwomen with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I\nmanaged by a policy of immediate large loop excision\nwould not be considered to have had unnecessary\ntreatment, while those managed by punch biopsies\nand selective recall might be considered to be under-\ntreated. In ALTS, 13% of women with grade I neopla-\nsia developed grade II\/III disease over two years.35 As\nscreening programmes reduce but do not eliminate\nrisk of disease,25 the key issue for a policy of biopsy\nand recall is whether incident high grade cervical intra-\nepithelial neoplasia in women with grade I disease\nwould be detected and treated as part of routine fol-\nlow-up before it progresses to invasive disease. In the\ncurrent trial, follow-up was based on standard NHS\ncervical screening programme protocols. Among the\n168 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia\ngrade I in the biopsy and recall arm, 12 (7.1%) cases\nof grade II disease or worse were diagnosed during\nfollow-up and a further five (3.0%) were found at the\nexit examination (although this was not part of stan-\ndard follow-up); no cases were more severe than\ngrade III. This suggests that the risk of incident high\ngrade disease in women with low grade abnormal\ncytology in the NHS cervical screening programmes\nand grade I neoplasia on punch biopsy is relatively\nlow and that most cases will be safely detected (and\ntreated) during routine follow-up.\nTable 3 | Incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade II or grade III or worse after three years of follow-up, by trial\narm and period of follow-up\nBiopsy and recall Immediate large loop excision\nRelative risk*\n(95% CI), P value\nNo (% of those\nin arm)\n% of disease\ndetected\nNo (% of those\nin arm)\n% of disease\ndetected\nTotal women randomised 1000 (100) \u2014 983 (100) \u2014 \u2014\nTotal person years of follow-up 2731 \u2014 2725 \u2014 \u2014\nCervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade II or worse\nTotal cases\u2020 216 (22) 100 228 (23) 100 \u2014\nAt initial colposcopy 160 (16) 74 202 (21) 89 \u2014\nAt follow-up 32 (3) 15 18 (2) 8 \u2014\nAt exit examination 24 (2) 11 8 (1) 4 \u2014\nCumulative incidence per 1000\nperson years\u00a7\n79 \u2014 84 \u2014 1.04 (0.86 to 1.25),\nP=0.687\nCervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III or worse\nTotal cases\u2020 107 (11) 100 113 (11) 100 \u2014\nAt initial colposcopy 83 (8) 78 102 (10) 90 \u2014\nAt follow-up 19 (2) 18 10 (1) 9 \u2014\nAt exit examination 5 (1) 5 1 (0.1) 1 \u2014\nCumulative incidence per 1000\nperson years\u00a7\n39 \u2014 41 \u2014 1.03 (0.79 to 1.34),\nP=0.841\n*Relative risk (with biopsy and recall as reference) based on total number of cases and adjusted for age (20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59), cytology at\nrecruitment (mild dyskaryosis, borderline nuclear abnormalities), centre (Grampian, Tayside, Nottingham), and high risk human papillomavirus status\n(positive, negative, unknown).\n\u2021Includes four women who had disease worse than cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III; three detected after initial colposcopy and treatment\n(one in biopsy and recall arm, two in immediate large loop excision arm), and one detected during follow-up in biopsy and recall arm.\nRESEARCH\npage 8 of 12 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\nMorbidity associated with management policies\nThe higher occurrence of haemorrhage and vasovagal\nevents in the large loop excision arm was unsurprising\ngiven that both are recognised risks of the procedure.11\nAlthough clinically important, recording complications\nduring procedures does not capture other physical after\neffects that women might experience, such as ongoing\npain or discharge. Our analysis in this paper was by\nintention to treat so probably underestimates the true\ndifference between policies. An analysis of after effects\nbased on management received by women is reported\nelsewhere.36 As size of excision has previously been\npositively associated with occurrence of bleeding,37 the\nobserved higher frequencies of moderate or more\nsevere bleeding and discharge in the immediate large\nloop excision armmight have been expected.\nAs women who participate in trials might be system-\natically different from those who do not, it is not clear\nthat our findings regarding overall levels of anxiety or\ndepression will be generalisible to all women with low\ngrade abnormal cytology. The internal comparison of\nthe trial arms, however, is valid. Our observation of no\nnotable difference between arms in anxiety after the\nprocedure contrasts with the results of Balasubramani\net al.24 In a non-randomised study of 272 women with\nhigh grade smear results, women who had immediate\nlarge loop excision reported lower anxiety and greater\nrelief oneweek after the intervention than those under-\ngoing biopsy and recall for treatment. The instruments\nfor assessing outcomes, and timing of these, differed\nfrom those in our trial. In addition, information given\nto women with high grade abnormal cytology, and\ntheir expectations and emotional and psychosocial\nresponses, might differ from women with low grade\nabnormal cytology.\nRecall for treatment: costs and default\nOne of the major potential limitations of a policy of\nbiopsies and selective recall is theneed for a proportion\nof women (16% of those randomised) to return for\ntreatment. The colposcopy clinic incurs the cost of an\nadditional appointment and women themselves\nexperience both inconvenience and time and travel\ncosts, the latter estimated at more than \u00a327 (\u20ac32, $44)\nper clinic visit.38 In our economic analysis, the cost\neffectiveness ratios of the two management policies\ndid not differ significantly.26 What remains unknown,\nhowever, is how women themselves balance the\nadvantage with see-and-treat of avoiding the cost and\ninconvenience of a second clinic visit against the risk of\novertreatment and increased physical after effects.\nA further potential drawback of biopsy and recall is\nthat women might not attend the treatment appoint-\nment, therefore increasing their risk of developing\nMonths\nPr\nop\nor\nti\non\n w\nit\nh \ndi\nse\nas\ne\n0 10 20 30 5040\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nBiopsy and recall\n\u03c72=0.856, df=1, P=0.355\nImmediate large loop excision\nFig 2 | Cumulative proportion of women developing cervical\nintraepithelial neoplasia grade II or more severe disease from\ntrial recruitment up to and including exit examination, by trial\narm (\u03c72 from log rank test)\nTable 4 | Incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade II or grade III or worse after three years of follow-up, stratified\nby age and recruitment cytology\nOutcome and subgroup\nBiopsy and recall Immediate large loop excision\nRelative risk*\n(95% CI) P value\nNo (%)\nof cases\nCumulative\nincidence\nNo (%) of\ncases\nCumulative\nincidence\nCervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade II or worse\nAge (years):\n20-29 134 (31) 116 137 (32) 117 1.01 (0.80 to 1.29) 0.904\n30-59 82 (14) 52 91 (16) 59 1.07 (0.79 to 1.44) 0.657\nCytology\u2020:\nMild dyskaryosis 129 (36) 134 120 (35) 125 0.90 (0.70 to 1.16) 0.424\nBorderline nuclear abnormalities 87 (14) 49 108 (17) 61 1.24 (0.94 to 1.65) 0.132\nCervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III or worse\nAge (years):\n20-29 69 (16) 60 69 (16) 59 0.99 (0.71 to 1.38) 0.950\n30-59 38 (7) 24 44 (8) 28 1.10 (0.71 to 1.70) 0.673\nCytology\u2021:\nMild dyskaryosis 67 (19) 69 59 (17) 62 0.84 (0.59 to 1.19) 0.332\nBorderline nuclear abnormalities 40 (6) 23 54 (8) 31 1.35 (0.90 to 2.04) 0.146\n*Comparison for immediate large loop excision v biopsy and recall (reference group).

The high rate of return for treatment\nin the biopsy and recall arm probably reflects the com-\nmitment of trial participants and might not generalise\nto routine clinical practice.\nStrengths and limitations\nThis trial was large, population based, and pragmatic.\nThe overall participation ratewas 52%.As regards gen-\neralisibility of the results to theNHS cervical screening\nprogramme, the ratio of borderline nuclear abnormal-\nities to mild recruitment smear results among partici-\npants (1.8:1) was close to that reported for the\nprogramme screening age group in 2004-5 (1.9:1).39 40\nDespite strenuous attempts to maximise\nattendance,28 a third of participants did not attend the\nexit examination. Thosewho did not attendweremore\nlikely to be young, be from non-white ethnic groups,\nhave only mildly abnormal results at recruitment, live\nin areas in the two most deprived categories, and be\nsmokers at recruitment. As several of these are risk fac-\ntors for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade II\/III\nand cervical cancer,41-43 the overall cumulative inci-\ndence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade II or\nworse was probably underestimated. The extent of the\nunderestimation is probably small, however, as only\n32 new cases were found at the exit examination\n(2.4% of attendees). In addition, the incidence of cervi-\ncal intraepithelial neoplasia grade II orworse up to, but\nnot including, the exit examination (14% and 33% for\nthose with recruitment smears showing borderline\nnuclear abnormalities and mild dyskaryosis, respec-\ntively), were similar to figures from two studies that\nfollowed participants in the NHS cervical screening\nprogramme with borderline nuclear abnormalities\nand mild dyskaryosis for five years (13% and 28%,44\n13% and 36%45). When we restricted our analysis to\nwomen who had attended the exit examination, the\nresults were unchanged (adjusted relative risk for\ngrade II or worse, large loop excision v biopsy 1.02,\n0.81 to 1.28).\nA greater proportion of women in the biopsy and\nselective recall arm had their clinical outcomes deter-\nmined from review of medical and hospital records\nand pathology databases. As some women who did\nnot attend the exit examination might have had\nundiagnosed disease, the differential attendance at\nexit by arm is a limitation of the trial. In theory the\nburden of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia might\nhave been underestimated to a greater extent in the\nbiopsy and recall arm than in the other arm, meaning\nthat we failed to detect a true difference between the\narms. Given the low frequency of high grade cervical\nintraepithelial neoplasia at exit, however, only a few\nadditional cases would have been detected had atten-\ndance in the biopsy and recall arm been as high as in\nthe other arm, and this would not have had a sufficient\nimpact on cumulative incidence to change the main\nfindings.\nIn recognition of its limitations, the role of colpo-\nscopy was restricted to categorising the transformation\nzone as normal or abnormal. Although large loop exci-\nsion became the most common treatment method for\ncervical intraepithelial neoplasia during the 1990s,\nablative treatment is still widely used and might offer\nTable 5 | Morbidity at six weeks after procedure* and incidence of clinically significant anxiety and depression by trial arm\u2020.\nFigures are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise\nBiopsy and recall\n(n=361\u2021)\nImmediate large loop excision\n(n=400\u00a7)\nDifference in % between arms\n(95% CI) P value\nPain:\nAny pain 143 (39.7) 153 (38.7) \u22121.0 (\u22128.0 to 6.0) 0.781\nMedian (IQR) duration (days) 2 (1-3) 2 (1-3) 0.782\nModerate or more severe 68 (19.0) 75 (19.2) 0.2 (\u22125.4 to 5.9) 0.935\nBleeding:\nAny bleeding 182 (50.4) 171 (43.5) \u22126.9 (\u221214.0 to 0.2) 0.058\nMedian (IQR) duration (days) 3 (2-5) 8 (3-20) <0.001\nModerate or more severe 55 (15.3) 84 (21.9) 6.5 (1.0 to 12.1) 0.022\nDischarge:\nAny discharge 122 (33.9) 139 (35.3) 1.3 (\u22125.5 to 8.1) 0.709\nMedian (IQR) duration (days) 3 (2-7) 9 (3-14) <0.001\nModerate or more severe 46 (12.8) 84 (21.4) 8.6 (3.2 to 13.9) 0.002\nAnxiety\u00b6 32 (9.4) 26 (6.8) \u22122.6 (\u22126.6 to 1.4) 0.203\nDepression** 27 (7.9) 22 (5.7) \u22122.2 (\u22125.9 to 1.5) 0.239\nIQR=interquartile range.\n*Questionnaires administered about six weeks after last procedure, whether colposcopy, punch biopsies, or large loop excision, to 502 women in\nbiopsy and recall arm and 487 in immediate large loop excision arm.\n\u2020Intention to treat analyses.

The policy does not\nmiss important disease, and, although a proportion of\nwomen are recalled for treatment, it is as cost effective\nas immediate large loop excision. Immediate large\nloop excision is not recommended as there is a consid-\nerable risk of overtreatment and more after effects.\nWe are grateful for the cooperation and assistance that we received from\nNHS staff in the coordinating centres and clinical sites.
