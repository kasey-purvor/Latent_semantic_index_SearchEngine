Introduction\n[2] In oscillatory flow and above steep, two\u2010dimensional\n(2D) ripples, the boundary layer between the flow and the\nbed can separate in the lee of the ripple, thus forming a\nvortex which at flow reversal is ejected into higher parts of\nthe flow. The near\u2010bed hydrodynamics and momentum\ntransfer is dominated by vortex formation and shedding and\nthe effect that this process has on near\u2010bed sediment sus-\npensions is profound. Sediment can be trapped in the shed\nvortex, which is advected both horizontally and vertically\n[Bijker et al., 1976; Hansen et al., 1994], and is released as\nthe vortex propagates above the bed and dissipates as tur-\nbulence becomes dominant. Under vortex shedding condi-\ntions maximum sediment pickup occurs as the vortex is\nadvected over the ripple crest around the instant of flow\nreversal [Nakato et al., 1977; Sleath and Wallbridge, 2002].\nIn contrast, over a flat bed where vortex shedding does not\noccur, maximum sediment pickup occurs at times of peak\nshear stress at the bed, closely preceding peak free\u2010stream\nvelocity [Davies and Thorne, 2008]. Davies and Villaret\n[1999] interpreted the vortex shedding process above rip-\nples in terms of a convective stress close to the bed,\ndescribed by a strongly time varying convective eddy vis-\ncosity with peaks at flow reversal. The time dependence of\nsuch a convective eddy viscosity has also been examined\nwith a cloud\u2010in\u2010cell discrete vortex model, above a ripple\nbed, and peaks were observed to occur at flow reversal\n[Malarkey and Davies, 2004]. Thus, these different\nentrainment processes impact upon the respective mixing\nmechanisms above flat and rippled beds: Coherent con-\nvective processes dominate close to rippled beds under\nvortex shedding conditions, whereas turbulent diffusion\ndominates above flat beds [Nielsen, 1992; Thorne et al.,\n2009a]. More recently, these convective and diffusive\nmixing processes have been related to the form of the sed-\niment diffusivity profile [Thorne et al., 2009a].\n[3] It is becoming increasingly well\u2010established that the\ncoherent and repeatable phenomenon of vortex shedding\nabove ripples can entrain sediment to considerably greater\nheights than above a flat bed. This is true both in a time\naveraged sense [e.g., Thorne et al., 2002] and at certain\nphases during the wave cycle [e.g., Bijker et al., 1976;\nNakato et al., 1977; Block et al., 1994; Davies and Thorne,\n2005; van der Werf et al., 2007]. Under symmetrical waves\nthe vortex shedding process occurs twice every wave cycle:\nOn the onshore and offshore sides of the ripple crest, during\nthe onshore and offshore phases of the wave cycle,\nrespectively. The ejection of sediment laden vortices above\nthe ripple crest occurs at flow reversal and this leads, for\n1School of Environmental Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool,\nUK.\n2National Oceanography Centre, Liverpool, UK.\nCopyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/11\/2010JC006216\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 116, C01001, doi:10.1029\/2010JC006216, 2011\nC01001 1 of 25\nexample, to the vortex generated during the onshore wave\nhalf cycle being advected in the offshore direction. Thus,\nunder asymmetric waves where the onshore orbital veloci-\nties are largest, an offshore pumping of sediment can occur\n[Bijker et al., 1976; Davies and Thorne, 2008].\n[4] The process of vortex formation and shedding is\ninherently linked to the bed forms present under such con-\nditions, namely vortex ripples, over which flow separation\ncan occur. Under quiescent wave forcing conditions the bed\nforms present are often those of relicts remaining from times\nof stronger wave activity [Nielsen, 1992], otherwise the bed\nis nominally plane. During these conditions, which can be\ndescribed as lower\u2010stage plane bed, there is little in the way\nof suspended sediment pickup as the bed shear stress is low\nand the relict bed forms are nonactive. Under surface waves\nof low steepness, long\u2010crested 2D ripples start to emerge on\nthe bed. As the surface wave steepness increases, the ripple\nsteepness increases and boundary layer separation is initi-\nated. During these conditions vortex ripples become active\nand begin to shed vortices. Thus, vortex ripples spread over\nthe bed and the process of vortex formation and shedding\ncan dominate the suspended sediment dynamics. As the\nsteepness of the surface waves increases further, the bed\nforms reduce in steepness and tend toward a (transitional)\nthree\u2010dimensional (3D) morphology where the crests first\nbecome sinuous and broken in form before becoming\nwashed out. Eventually, as surface wave steepness continues\nto increase toward storm conditions, the bed becomes an\nupper\u2010stage plane bed with sheet flow dominant.\n[5] Ripples with wavelengths that scale with the wave\norbital diameter, termed orbital ripples [Clifton, 1976;\nClifton and Dingler, 1984], are predominant in laboratory\nexperiments and are steep sided with ripple height to\nwavelength ratios (steepness) greater than 0.1. While orbital\nripples can be found in the field, anorbital ripples, with\nwavelengths roughly proportional to the bed sediment grain\nsize, are much more common [Wiberg and Harris, 1994].\nAnorbital ripples occur when the orbital diameter is larger\nthan the ripple wavelength. Thus, anorbital ripples can be\nreferred to as decaying ripples, present at times of transition\nbetween orbital ripples and upper\u2010stage plane bed [Allen,\n1997]. Suborbital ripples are a transitional type and occur\nwhen the orbital diameter is between that of orbital and\nanorbital ripples.\n[6] Some of the earliest observations of vortex entrain-\nment of sediment above ripples were made by Bagnold\n[1946] in an oscillating water tank. Bijker et al. [1976]\ninferred the process of vortex shedding from observations\nof suspended sand transport opposite to the direction of\nwave propagation as well as making photographic ob-\nservations of the vortex shedding and sediment entrainment\nprocess. Some of the earliest intrawave measurements of\nsuspended sediment concentration (SSC) were made by\nNakato et al. [1977] in regular oscillatory flow generated in\na water tunnel. Nakato et al. [1977] observed two dominant\npeaks in the SSC during the wave cycle and contributed\nthese to vortex ejection during each wave half cycle.\nVortex shedding has also been directly observed in the\nlaboratory under regular [Tunstall and Inman, 1975] and\nirregular [Villard and Osborne, 2002] free surface waves\nand its existence has been inferred in the field [Ardhuin\net al., 2002]. Observations of SSC have been made under\nwaves and over ripples on a macrotidal beach where a weak\ncurrent was present using an Acoustic Backscatter System\n(ABS) [Osborne and Vincent, 1996], although evidence of\nvortex generation was only found during the onshore phase\nof the wave cycles. More recently, the SSC profile on an\nintrawave time scale under regular oscillatory flow has\nbeen measured using ABS [Thorne et al., 2003; Davies and\nThorne, 2005; van der Werf et al., 2007]. A coherent\nphenomenon consistent with the entrainment of sediment in\na lee\u2010wake vortex shed at flow reversal was identified, thus\nconfirming the existence of vortex entrainment processes at\nlarge scale under regular oscillatory flow. One recent\ndevelopment was that of Nichols and Foster [2007] who\nmade observations of the near\u2010bed velocity field, above an\nasymmetrical ripple under irregular waves in a large wave\nflume, using a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system\nand found that the ejection of a vortex was a function of the\nflow acceleration.\n[7] In laboratory experiments, regular waves are often\nused for simplicity, however irregular waves simulate nature\nmore closely [Soulsby, 1997], containing a broad spectrum\nof wave heights and periods. The near\u2010bed velocity field\nunder regular waves provides a repeatable orbital excursion\nthat is conducive to both the formation of wave ripples and\nthe subsequent formation of lee\u2010wake vortices in each wave\nhalf cycle. In contrast to regular waves, the horizontal\nvelocity field under irregular waves has a distribution of\nvelocity amplitudes, oscillation periods, and thus orbital\nexcursion diameters, which govern the formation of ripples\nand the suspension of sediment. Thus, vortex formation and\nshedding will not necessarily occur during each wave half\ncycle under irregular waves. It is questionable therefore,\nwhether the intrawave signatures present in the suspended\nsediment dynamics of vortex formation and shedding are\ndominant under irregular waves, as is the case under regular\noscillatory flow [e.g., Davies and Thorne, 2005; van der\nWerf et al., 2007]. Furthermore, it is at present unknown\nin an irregular wave sequence, under which wave half cycle\nvortex formation occurs. Refining our understanding of this\nhas significant implications as many models simply char-\nacterize the flow with average parameters such as the sig-\nnificant wave height (Hs). It is therefore useful to quantify\nthe fraction of waves where vortex shedding is expected to\noccur under different hydrodynamic regimes, described by\nHs for example.\n[8] The Deltaflume of Deltares, Delft Hydraulics, Neth-\nerlands, is a large flume facility ideal for the study of sed-\niment transport processes at near field\u2010scales. In 2001, a\ncomprehensive dataset of measurements covering the sedi-\nment transport triad of wave forcing, bed forms, and sus-\npended sediment [Thorne and Hanes, 2002] was collected,\nunder irregular waves. These data have been reported pre-\nviously in studies focusing on bed forms [Williams et al.,\n2004; Williams and Bell, 2006]. In the present study, the\nbed forms are re\u2010examined and the intrawave structure of\nthe suspended sediments is studied for the first time.\nThe underlying questions this present study addresses\nare: (1) Whether vortex formation and shedding is a dom-\ninant mechanism of sediment entrainment under irregular\nwaves; (2) under what proportion of wave half cycles this\nmechanism occurs; and (3) whether these occurrences can\nbe parameterized by the ratio of orbital diameter to ripple\nO\u2019HARA MURRAY ET AL.: INTRAWAVE ENTRAINMENT ABOVE RIPPLES C01001C01001\n2 of 25\nwavelength as suggested by Malarkey and Davies [2002].\nFinally, irregular wave forcing is often parameterized by the\nsignificant wave height which is in turn commonly used\nwithin models. Hence, in the present study the relationship\nbetween the significant wave height, the ripple dimensions,\nand the occurrence of vortex shedding is investigated\nbecause of the direct relevance this has with existing\nnumerical modeling frameworks.\n2. Models and Prediction of Vortex Shedding\n[9] Davies and Thorne [2008] presented a simple mod-\neling framework for oscillatory flow above erodible sandy\nbeds. Figure 1 shows a schematic of common bed form\nregimes under regular oscillatory flow, from the vortex\nshedding regime to the upper\u2010stage plane bed, under\nincreasing surface wave steepness. Beneath (regular) waves,\nthe orbital excursion diameter of each wave half cycle, d0,\nscales with the surface wave steepness. Key to parameter-\nizing bed form regimes is the Shields parameter, a dimen-\nsionless measure of the balance between disturbing (shear\nstress) and stabilizing forces on individual surface sediment\nparticles. Figure 1 shows the skin friction Shields parameter,\n\u0001, increasing with the surface wave steepness. Another\nparameterization is the relative roughness, d0\/2ks, where ks\nis the equivalent roughness which describes the influence\nthe bed has on the flow. Above lower\u2010stage plane beds, the\ndominate contribution to the roughness is the Nikuradse\ngrain roughness due to skin friction, typically given by\n[Soulsby, 1997]\nks \u00bc 2:5D50: \u00f01\u00de\nBased on this equivalent grain roughness, the grain rough-\nness Shields parameter, \u00012.5, can be defined as [e.g., Nielsen,\n1992]\n\u00012:5 \u00bc f2:5U\n2\n0\n2 s\u0002 1\u00f0 \u00degD50 ; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere s is the ratio of sediment density to water density (s =\n2.65 for quartz sand), D50 is the median grain diameter of\nthe bed sediment, g is the acceleration due to gravity, U0 is\nthe wave orbital amplitude, and f2.5 is the grain roughness\nwave friction factor (skin friction) based on equation (1).\nOne expression for f2.5 is that developed by Soulsby [1997]\nfor rough turbulent flow which, with equation (1) substi-\ntuted in, is given by\nf2:5 \u00bc 0:237 d0=5D50\u00f0 \u00de\u00020:52: \u00f03\u00de\nWhen bed forms are present, the dominant contribution to\nthe roughness is due to form drag [van Rijn, 2007] and ks is\noften expressed in terms of the ripple dimensions. One\ncommonly used form for ks above a rippled bed is [Grant\nand Madsen, 1982; Nielsen, 1992; Styles and Glenn,\n2002; Davies and Thorne, 2008]\nks \u00bc \u0003\u0004 \u0004=\u0005\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere h and l are the height and wavelength, respectively,\nof the ripples present on the bed. There are conflicting re-\nports as to the precise value of a. For example, Grant and\nMadsen [1982] proposed a = 27.7 whereas Nielsen [1992]\nproposed a = 8. There can also be roughness associated\nwith a moving sand layer, during sheet flow conditions; for\nFigure 1.

Vortex Shedding Criteria\n[10] The ripples above which vortex formation and\nshedding occur are termed vortex ripples and are typical\nduring the \u20182D steep ripple\u2019 regime defined in Figure 1.\nVortex shedding occurs only when the ripples are suffi-\nciently steep for the boundary layer to separate on the lee of\nthe ripple crests [Sleath, 1984]. Hence, the steepness of the\nripple is one control over whether vortex formation and\nshedding occur and is used in the expression for ks above\nrippled beds (equation (4)). It is widely assumed that vortex\nshedding only starts when h\/l ^ 0.1 [Davies and Thorne,\n2005]. Allen [1979] suggested that h\/l \u2248 0.13 marks the\ntransition from rolling\u2010grain to vortex ripples and Malarkey\nand Davies [2004] considered 0.13 \u2264 h\/l \u2264 0.2 to define an\napproximate vortex shedding regime. Likewise, Davies and\nVillaret [2002] considered the bed to be \u2018dynamically\nplane\u2019, where no vortex shedding processes occur, when h\/l\n< 0.12. Thus, the h\/l values in Figure 1 indicate whether\nflow separation is likely to occur in each regime.\n[11] As indicated in Figure 1, d0\/2ks increases with the\nevolving bed under progressively increasing wave steep-\nness. In the vortex ripple regime, where d0\/2ks \u223c O(1), ks is\nrelated to the ripple dimensions by equation (4). Taking the\nripple steepness as h\/l = 0.12 and a = 8 [Nielsen, 1992], ks\ncan be related the ripple height, ks = 0.96h, or the ripple\nwavelength, ks = 0.1252l, and in the vortex shedding\nregime the relative roughness is given by\nd0=2ks \u0003 4:34d0=\u0005: \u00f07\u00de\nMalarkey and Davies [2002] used the parameter d0\/l to\ndefine a secondary vortex shedding criterion, 1 \u2264 d0\/l \u2264 4,\nwhich roughly equates to 4.3 \u2264 d0\/2ks \u2264 17.4 using\nequation (7). This criteria, 1 \u2264 d0\/l \u2264 4, has significant impli-\ncations for sediment entrainment and transport. Beneath\nregular waves, where d0\/l is relatively constant, this is not\nsuch an issue, but beneath irregular waves it implies that\nvortex shedding will occur intermittently due to the distri-\nbution of orbital diameters. When d0\/l is between 1 and 4,\nvortex shedding is expected to dominate the entrainment of\nsediment. The nonseparating flow limit, d0\/l = 1, is where it\nis unlikely for the flow to be strong enough for boundary\nlayer separation to occur. The upper limit, d0\/l > 4, defines\nthe point where the organized flow structure of vortex for-\nmation and shedding starts to give way to more homogenous\nturbulence where peaks in the sediment pickup occur at\nphases that are more in line with flat bed (sheet flow) behavior\n[Malarkey and Davies, 2002]. The observations of Nichols\nand Foster [2007] using PIV confirmed both intermittent\nvortex shedding under irregular waves and also its depen-\ndence on the flow velocity (related to the orbital excursion).\nThe dependence of the parameter d0\/l on the ripple wave-\nlength has strong implications in the natural environment\nwhere there is likely to be a distribution of ripple wave-\nlengths present on the bed. The dependence of vortex\nshedding on d0\/l has been examined theoretically with\ncloud\u2010in\u2010cell and discrete vortex models and compared\nwith laboratory measurements of the water particles in\ntwo\u2010dimensions [Malarkey and Davies, 2002], but not to\nour knowledge under field\u2010scale irregular waves, or through\nobservations of the suspended sediments and fluid flow.\n2.2. Suspended Sediment Concentrations\n[12] One method of predicting the sediment concentration\nunder oscillatory flow is to separate the magnitude and\ndistribution of SSC above the bed. For example, the time\naveraged profile of SSC above ripples and under waves, C\n(z), is often expressed in the form\nC z\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc C0 exp \u0002z=L\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f08\u00de\nwhere z is the height above the bed and L is the vertical\ndecay length scale. The reference concentration, typically\ntaken at the bed level, is a measure of the concentration\nmagnitude and is commonly expressed theoretically in terms\nof the grain roughness Shields parameter (\u00012.5) given by\nequation (2). Above ripples, Nielsen [1986] modified \u00012.5 to\naccount for flow enhancement near the ripple crest:\n\u0001r \u00bc \u00012:5\n1\u0002 \u0006\u0004=\u0005\u00f0 \u00de2 ; \u00f09\u00de\nwhere l and h are the wavelength and height of the ripples,\nrespectively. Nielsen [1986] found a cubic dependence of\nthe mass reference concentration, C0, taken over the ripple\ncrest (at crest level) on \u0001r:\nC0 \u00bc 0:005\u0007s\u00013r ; \u00f010\u00de\nwhere rs is the sediment density. Equation (10) was con-\nfirmed by Thorne et al. [2002] under large\u2010scale regular\nwaves although the empirical coefficient, 0.005 in equation\n(10), was found to be 0.0022 \u00b1 0.0005, close to a factor of\ntwo smaller.\n[13] Reference concentrations based on the Shields\nparameter, for example equation (10), are time averages,\noften over many wave cycles, that is, C0 = c0\u00f0t\u00de where c0(t)\nis the instantaneous reference concentration as a function of\ntime (t) and the over bar indicates a time average. Similarly,\nthe grain roughness Shields parameter defined as \u00012.5 in\nequation (2) is based on the orbital velocity amplitude, U0. It\nfollows that the instantaneous, time varying, reference\nconcentration, c0(t), cannot be straightforwardly expressed\nin terms of \u00012.5 and \u0001r defined here. From a modeling point\nof view, Davies et al. [1997] discussed the difficulties\nassociated with applying the reference concentration\napproach in time dependant sediment suspension problems.\nThey commented that one way to overcome these difficul-\nties is with the use of a time varying sediment pickup\nfunction based on the SSC gradient near the bed. Never-\ntheless, it is established that variations in sediment entrain-\nO\u2019HARA MURRAY ET AL.: INTRAWAVE ENTRAINMENT ABOVE RIPPLES C01001C01001\n4 of 25\nment through the wave cycle lead to instantaneous varia-\ntions in c0(t), and therefore that sediment pickup and c0(t)\nare intrinsically linked.\n[14] Nielsen [1992] suggested empirical equations for the\ndecay length scale of the SSC profile given by equation (8):\nL \u00bc\n0:075\nU0\nws\n\u0004\nU0\nws\n< 18\n1:4\u0004\nU0\nws\n\u0004 18:\n8><\n>:\n\u00f011\u00de\nThe settling velocity of the suspended sediment, ws, can be\ncalculated from knowledge of the median grain size of the\nsuspended sediment, Ds50, using the formula of Soulsby\n[1997]\nws \u00bc \bDs50\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n10:362 \u00fe 1:049D3*\nq\n\u0002 10:36\nh i\n; \u00f012\u00de\nwhere u is the kinematic viscosity of water and D* is a\ndimensionless grain size given by\nD* \u00bc\ng s\u0002 1\u00f0 \u00de\n\b2\n\u0003 \u00041=3\nDs50: \u00f013\u00de\nUnder fixed wave forcing conditions (e.g., U0 = 1 m\/s),\nU0\/ws is <18 typically when coarse sediments (i.e. ws >\n18\u22121 m\/s, Ds50 ^ 370 mm) are in suspension. In this case,\nL varies with U0\/ws and the ripple height (h). When U0\/ws\n> 18, that is for finer sediment (explicitly ws \u2264 18\u22121 m\/s,\nDs50] 370 mm), L is only dependant on h, and C(z) decays at\nthe same rate under different wave forcing conditions as long\nas the ripples have the same height. When U0\/ws < 18, that is,\nwhen coarse sediments are in suspension, equation (11) is\ndependent on the sediment settling velocity. This is likely to\nbe a source of uncertainty in the prediction of Lwhere a broad\nsediment size distribution is present. In these cases the set-\ntling velocity distribution should be considered. It is worth\nnoting that there has been some work on the suspensions of\ngraded sediment [e.g.,Nielsen, 1983;Nielsen, 1992; Tomkins\net al., 2003].\n3. Experimental Instrumentation and\nMethodology\n[15] Irregular waves with a Joint North Sea Wave Project\n(JONSWAP) spectrum [Carter, 1982] were generated for a\nnumber of significant wave heights in the Deltares Delft\nHydraulics Deltaflume. This large scale flume (230 m long,\n5 m wide, and 7 m deep) enables a variety of sediment\ntransport processes to be monitored at field scale.\n[16] Experiments were conducted first over a fine\u2010\nmedium\u2010grained sand bed and then over an upper\u2010medium\u2010\ngrained sand bed. Using laser granulometry, the two sediment\nbeds were found to have grain size distributions lognormal\nin form, with the fine\u2010medium\u2010grained bed having D10 =\n161 mm, D50 = 258 mm, and D90 = 408 mm and the upper\u2010\nmedium\u2010grained bed having D10 = 243 mm, D50 = 375 mm,\nand D90 = 577 mm. In each case, a 0.7 m deep sediment bed\nwas laid down in the center of the flume in a 30 m long\nregion spanning the width of the flume. A series of\nexperiments were performed over each sand bed. For\nboth the fine\u2010medium\u2010grained and upper\u2010medium\u2010grained\nexperiment sets, the sand bed was initially a horizontal\nplane bed (P. S. Bell and J. J. Williams, Comprehensive\nmeasurements of sediment resuspension processes by waves\nat full\u2010scale, Internal Document 143, Proudman Oceano-\ngraphic Laboratory, Liverpool, U.K.) and was not flattened\nbetween experiments such that each experiment inherited\nthe bed morphology formed during the previous experi-\nment. Each experiment differed only by the significant\nwave height Hs of the surface wave forcing, such that, over\nthe course of the experiments, Hs varied between 0.2 and\n1.9 m. In total, 16 experiments were conducted over the\nfine\u2010medium\u2010grained sand bed, referred to here as F01,\nF02, \u2026, F16, and 17 experiments were conducted over the\nupper\u2010medium\u2010grained sand bed, referred to here as M01,\nM02, \u2026, M17. The peak spectral period was held at a\nconstant 6.1 s during all the experiments.\n[17] Figure 2 is a schematic of the instruments deployed\non a frame aligned to one side of the flume on the sandy\nbed. In this study, acoustic data from two Nortek Acoustic\nDoppler Velocimeters (ADV\u20101 and ADV\u20102), an Acoustic\nRipple Profiler (ARP), a Sector Scanning Sonar (SSS), and\nan Acoustic Backscatter System (ABS) were examined to\nstudy water velocities, bed form cross\u2010sections, plan\u2010form\nbed form features, and suspended sediments, respectively. A\npump sampling system [Bosman et al., 1987] was mounted\non the instrument frame and samples of the suspended\nsediment laden water were taken during a number of ex-\nperiments and were used here to provide time\u2010averaged\nsuspended particle size and concentration. The horizontal\n(along\u2010shore) and vertical positioning of the instruments,\nrelative to the side of the instrument frame closest to the\nwall of the Deltaflume and the surface of the undisturbed\nsandy bed, respectively, are indicated in Figure 2. During\nthe course of the experiments the local level of the sand bed\nvaried due to ripple formation and to the feet of the\ninstrument frame settling into the sand. Thus, the vertical\ndistances between the instruments and the sandy bed varied\nover the experimental period. The SSS operated at 1.2 MHz\nmechanically scanning through 400 angular steps during\neach revolution taking approximately 60 s [Williams et al.,\n2004] and was positioned at the onshore end of the instru-\nment frame. The ARP operated at 2 MHz scanning a 4 m\ntransect of the bed approximately every 63 s at centimeter\nhorizontal resolution and subcentimeter vertical resolution\nproviding a 2D profile of the bed, and how it changed with\ntime. The 16 Hz time\u2010series obtained from the ADVs con-\nsisted of 3 orthogonal components of flow: Horizontal\nalong\u2010flume (cross\u2010shore); horizontal across\u2010flume (along\u2010\nshore); and vertical. ADV\u20101 and ADV\u20102 were mounted on\nthe frame such that their measuring volumes were 0.57 and\n0.145 m above the base of the instrument frame, respec-\ntively, measuring the free\u2010stream and near\u2010bed water\nvelocities, respectively. The ABS comprised 3 transducers\naligned perpendicular to the flow (along\u2010shore), operating at\n1, 2, and 4 MHz, and these monitored the SSC above the\nbed at 1 cm vertical resolution. The ABS collected back-\nscatter profiles at 128 Hz at each frequency, which were\neach subsequently block averaged in order to improve the\nstatistical reliability of the results to produce backscatter\nprofiles at 4 Hz. The pumped samples were dry weighed\nyielding time averaged concentration measurements at five\nheights above the bed. A multiplication factor of 1.4 was\nO\u2019HARA MURRAY ET AL.: INTRAWAVE ENTRAINMENT ABOVE RIPPLES C01001C01001\n5 of 25\napplied to the pumped sampled sediment concentrations on\nthe basis of the findings of Bosman et al. [1987]. Subse-\nquently, the dried pumped samples were analyzed using\nlaser diffraction to obtain the distribution of grain sizes. The\nARP, ABS, and ADV\u20102 were collocated on an along\u2010shore\nline (perpendicular to the flow) ensuring that they were\napproximately at the same location on a 2D ripple cross\u2010\nsection. Finally, the elevation of the water surface was\nmonitored by a wave staff mounted on a gantry above the\nflume. Further details of the Deltaflume, the 2001 experi-\nmental setup, and the instruments deployed were presented\nby Williams et al. [2003, 2004, 2005] and Williams and Bell\n[2006].\n[18] In the present study, data from four Deltaflume ex-\nperiments are examined. The first, F08, was selected on the\ngrounds that vortex ripples were not present and the bed\napproximated to an upper\u2010stage plane bed above which no\nrippled bed sediment dynamics occurred. During experi-\nments M04, M05 and M06, steep\u2010sided ripples, the di-\nmensions of which conformed to descriptions of vortex\nripples, were present. During these three experiments the\nABS was above a ripple crest, and these measurement\nFigure 2.

To summarize, data from F08 and M04\u2013M06\nenabled flat bed and rippled bed sediment dynamics,\nrespectively, to be studied under irregular waves. The pro-\nfiles of SSC were phase locked to the ADV velocities. Thus,\nworking in the phase domain, ensemble averages over many\nwave cycles were computed, enabling the underlying in-\ntrawave structure of the SSC above plane and rippled beds\nand under irregular waves to be studied. Whether this in-\ntrawave structure, beneath irregular waves, displays the\nsame features in the rippled bed cases to that below regular\nwaves [e.g., Davies and Thorne, 2005] is investigated in the\npresent study.\n4. Data Analysis and Results\n4.1. Irregular Wave Forcing\n[19] The irregular surface waves were generated con-\nforming to JONSWAP spectra (P. S. Bell and J. J. Williams,\nComprehensive measurements of sediment resuspension\nprocesses by waves at full\u2010scale, Internal Document 143,\nProudman Oceanographic Laboratory, Liverpool, U.K.) and\nthe elevation was measured at 25 Hz by wave staffs sus-\npended above the flume. The significant wave height Hs was\ncalculated for each experiment as [e.g., Soulsby, 1997;\nWiberg and Sherwood, 2008]\nHs \u00bc 4 ffiffiffiffiffiffim0p ; \u00f014\u00de\nwhere m0 is the variance of the water surface elevation. The\npeak spectral period Tp for each experiment was taken as the\ninverse of the frequency at which the power spectral density\nof the water surface elevations peaked. Table 1 lists the\ncalculated values of Hs and Tp for each experiment. The\ndispersion equation was solved using average water depths\nh, obtained from a pressure sensor present in the Deltaflume,\nand Tp. Table 1 lists the water depths and resulting wave\nnumbers, k, together with predictions of the significant\nvelocity amplitude, U0s, and the orbital excursion diameter,\nd0s, based on linear wave theory:\nU0s \u00bc \u0006HsTp sinh kh\u00f0 \u00de \u00f015\u00de\nd0s \u00bc U0sTp=\u0006: \u00f016\u00de\nThese U0s and d0s values were used in place of U0 and d0 in\nequations (2) and (3) to calculate \u00012.5 and f2.5 for each\nexperiment, and the results are included in Table 1. The\nspectra of the water surface elevation were examined and\ncompared with theoretical JONSWAP spectra [Carter,\n1982; Podgorski et al., 2000] based on the observed va-\nlues of Hs and Tp. Figure 3 presents the theoretical and\nobserved wave spectra for each experiment, and shows that\nthe theoretical spectra compare well with the data, in both\namplitude and width.\n4.2. Bed Forms\n[20] The bed forms were observed using an ARP and a\nSSS. The ARP time series were examined and, in the case of\nthe rippled bed experiment, temporal regions where the\nripples were in a steady state and the ARP was consistently\nover a ripple crest were identified. These temporal regions\nFigure 3. The power spectral density (PSD) of the surface elevation recoded by the wave staff during\nfour Deltaflume experiments with a 21 point running average applied and the theoretical JONSWAP spec-\ntra (black lines) with measured Hs and Tp as inputs and a peak enhancement factor of g = 3.3.\nO\u2019HARA MURRAY ET AL.: INTRAWAVE ENTRAINMENT ABOVE RIPPLES C01001C01001\n7 of 25\ndefined the burst for each rippled bed experiment during\nwhich the data were examined. Similarly, for the plane bed\nexperiment (F08) a burst was chosen on the grounds that the\nbed was in a steady state throughout. Figure 4 shows the\ntemporal variation in these 2D bed profiles during the\nbursts, which were low\u2010pass filtered with a Gaussian fil-\ntering window to remove high frequency spatial fluctua-\ntions. Figure 4a, F08, for the fine\u2010medium\u2010grained bed\nshows the remnants of a rippled bed which was washed out\nto form a long wavelength bed form, similar to those\nobserved by Hanes et al. [2001]. This washed out bed ap-\nproximates, for the purposes here, to an upper\u2010stage plane\nbed above which no rippled bed sediment dynamics were\nexpected to occur. Equation (5) was used to calculate the\nequivalent roughness due to a moving sand layer, and this\nyielded a relative roughness of d0s\/2ks = 28.97. This d0s\/2ks\nvalue and the Shields parameter for F08 listed in Table 1\nplace F08 within the washed\u2010out ripples regime in Figure 1.\nFigures 4b\u20134d show that during the upper\u2010medium\u2010grained\nexperiments rippled beds were formed. A turning point\nanalysis was performed to extract the spatial distribution of\nripple wavelengths, heights, and steepness for each profile.\nThe wavelength of a ripple was taken as the distance between\ntwo troughs surrounding a crest, the height of this ripple was\ntaken as the mean crest to trough height difference on either\nside of the ripple crest and the steepness was taken as the\nheight to wavelength ratio. Table 2 lists the spatial and\ntemporal mean ripple wavelengths (l), heights (h), and\nsteepness (h\/l) and their associated standard deviations (s)\nfor the rippled bed experiments. The temporal mean average\nFigure 4. Bed profiles obtained from the ARP during (a) plane bed and (b\u2013d) rippled bed Deltaflume\nexperiments. The measurement bursts considered during the rippled bed experiments were chosen on\nthe grounds that a crest of a ripple was below the ABS situated above the origin of the horizontal\n(cross\u2010shore) axis, indicated by the arrows Figures 4a\u20134d.\nTable 1.

Figure 5 clearly\nshows that during the rippled bed bursts the acoustic devices\nwere approximately above a ripple crest. The spatial and\ntemporal average ripple steepness in the rippled bed cases\n(h\/l, Table 2) are close to 0.1, above which vortex shedding\nstarts to occur [Davies and Thorne, 2005]. The steepness of\nthe ripples directly below the acoustic instrumentation (h0\/\nl0, Table 2) were above this threshold, suggesting that it\nwas likely that vortex shedding occurred below the ABS\ntransducers.\n[22] In addition to the ARP cross\u2010sections, the SSS data\nwere examined in order to reveal the plan\u2010form geometry of\nthe rippled beds. The SSS data were rectified from polar\ncoordinates to square grid and a slant range correction was\napplied (P. S. Bell and J. J. Williams, Comprehensive\nmeasurements of sediment resuspension processes by waves\nat full\u2010scale, Internal Document 143, Proudman Oceano-\ngraphic Laboratory, Liverpool, U.K.). Figure 6 shows the\nSSS results in the form of 2D 5 \u00d7 5 m images of the bed\nproduced just prior to the measurement bursts considered\nhere. The temporally and spatially average ripple wave-\nlengths obtained from the ARP (Table 2) during M04\u2013M06\nare indicated in Figures 6b\u20136d and show the ripple crest\nlengths to be typically longer than their wavelengths.\nHowever, the ripple crests are sinuous, especially during\nM05 and M06.

Such a classification\nis in agreement with the results from the ARP (Figures 4 and\n5) and the SSS (Figure 6). Using the dimensions of the\nripples below the ABS (h0 and h0\/l0, Table 2) and equation\n(6), d0s\/2ks was calculated to be 5.75, 7.30, and 6.85 during\nexperiments M04, M05, and M06, respectively. These va-\nlues are broadly in agreement with the dominantly 2D\nclassification using the \u00012.5 values, although suggestive that\nboth M05 and M06 should have 3D ripples emerging, which\nbroadly agrees with the SSS images (Figure 6). Using\ninstead the dimensions of the spatially averaged ripples (h\nand h\/l, Table 2), d0s\/2ks was found to be 10.84, 11.58, and\n12.15 during experiments M04, M05, and M06, respec-\ntively, which moves the classification more into the 3D\nrealm (according to the parameterizations in Figure 1). It is\nconcluded here therefore, that during M04 the rippled bed\nwas dominantly 2D in form. During M05, however, 3D\nripples started to emerge and the plan\u2010form geometry of the\nbed is thus classified as quasi\u20102D [Pedocchi and Garcia,\n2009]. During M06, the 3D ripples continued to emerge\nand became more dominant features on the bed, although\nthere remained some remnants of the quasi\u20102D ripples.\nFrom these classifications of the plan\u2010form geometry, it was\nconcluded that the ripples beneath the ARP were sufficiently\nlong\u2010crested for them to be classified as locally two\ndimensional for the present analysis.\n4.3. Suspended Sediments\n[23] The root mean square (RMS) average voltage back-\nscattered from the suspended sediments measured by the\nABS transceivers can be expressed as [Thorne and Hanes,\n2002]\nVrms \u00bc hf iffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffihasi\u0007sp\nkt\nyr\nM 1=2e\u00022r \u0003w\u00fe\u0003s\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f017a\u00de\nwhere\n\u0003s \u00bc 1r\nZr\n0\n3h\ti\n4hasi\u0007s M r\u00f0 \u00dedr \u00f017b\u00de\nis the attenuation due to sediment.

In the case of the rippled bed experiments (Figures 6b\u20136d) the typical ripple wavelengths, l,\ndetermined by analysis of the ARP data are indicated.\nO\u2019HARA MURRAY ET AL.: INTRAWAVE ENTRAINMENT ABOVE RIPPLES C01001C01001\n10 of 25\nfunctions f and c describe the intrinsic backscattering and\nattenuation characteristics for narrowly sieved sediments\n[Moate and Thorne, 2009], expressions for which were\nchosen on the grounds that they represent natural sands\n[Thorne and Meral, 2008]. Solving equation (17) for the\nsediment concentration (M) at each range bin from the\ntransceivers is nontrivial, as as is a function of M; thus, an\ninversion methodology is required.\n4.3.1. Grain Size Distributions\n[24] The type and width of the suspended sediment grain\nsize distribution affects the backscattering and attenuation\ncharacteristics of the sediments, and can therefore strongly\ninfluence the acoustic ABS inversion [Moate and Thorne,\n2009]. It is therefore important to represent the ensemble\nscattering characteristics of the suspension by averaging f\nand c over the particle number size distribution present in\nsuspension, to obtain hfi and hci. In this study, the near\u2010bed\nSSC is of primary importance and within the bottom 0.25 m\nof the bed the suspended median grain diameter, Ds50, of the\npumped samples collected was nominally uniform with\nheight above the bed. Hence the mass size distributions from\nthe lower three pump sampling nozzles (typically within\n0.25 m of the bed) were combined for each experiment.\nThese mass size distributions of the pumped samples were\nfound to be lognormal in form. Figure 7 shows the cumu-\nlative size distribution of the mass concentration (open cir-\ncles) of the combined pumped sampled results for each\nexperiment. Fitted to this data are lognormal cumulative\ndistribution functions with their Ds50 values indicated. To\nobtain hfi and hci for the acoustic inversion, the mass size\ndistributions were converted to particle number size dis-\ntributions, the cumulative distribution functions of which are\nalso shown in Figure 7 with their arithmetic means, hasi,\nindicated. These lognormal size distributions (Figure 7)\nwere characterized by their standard deviation to mean\nratios, s\/hasi, of 0.42, 0.64, 0.39, and 0.35 for experiments\nF08, M04, M05, and M06, respectively. Thus, the ensemble\nbackscattering and attenuation characteristics of the sus-\npended sediment, hfi and hci, were calculated by averaging\nf and c over the lognormal size distributions of the sus-\npended sediment described by the s\/hasi values.\n4.3.2. Acoustic Inversion\n[25] Initial explicit inversions [Lee and Hanes, 1995;\nThorne and Hanes, 2002] for sediment mass concentration\nwere performed on the RMS time average backscattered\nvoltage from each transceiver. The RMS time averages were\ncalculated over the time periods during which the pumped\nsamples were taken and the pumped sampled (time aver-\naged) sediment concentrations were used to constrain the\nexplicit inversions. To further aid the inversions, the height\nFigure 7.

The grain sizes for each experiment were those\nindicated in Figure 7. In order to gain instantaneous con-\ncentration profiles, implicit inversions [Thorne and Hanes,\n2002] for sediment mass concentration were performed on\nthe 4 Hz ABS backscatter time series. The ABS system\nconstant, kt, required in the implicit inversions, for each of\nthe three ABS transceivers was determined from the\nexplicit inversion results. Thus, the implicit ABS inver-\nsions were linked to the pumped sampled concentrations\nfrom the four experiments.\n[26] The implicit inversions resulted in time series of SSC\nprofiles at 4Hz for each frequency. Mean time averages of\nthese results were calculated for each experiment, and at each\nfrequency, in order to test their validity against the inde-\npendent pumped sampled measurements. Figure 8 shows the\ntime\u2010averaged sediment concentrations from the implicit\ninversions, CA, compared with the concentrations obtained\nfrom the pumped samples, CP. There are errors associated\nwith both CA and CP. Concentration CA is the mean of the\ninversion results from the three ABS frequencies. The error\nbars indicate the associated standard error. The indicated\nerror on CP is \u00b120%, which is the typical error found by\nMoate and Thorne [2009]. Sediment concentration estimates\nfrom the ABS is typically accurate to within a factor of two\n[Vincent, 2007] and the majority of data in Figure 8 falls\nwithin that range. A regression on the data in Figure 8 gave\nCA = (1.18 \u00b1 0.14) CP \u2212 (0.05 \u00b1 0.03) with R2 = 0.93. This\nregression and Figure 8 both confirm the veracity of the ABS\nmeasurements of suspended sediment concentration.\n4.3.3. Time\u2010Averaged SSC Profiles\n[27] Figure 9 shows the time\u2010averaged SSC profiles, C(z),\nobtained from the calibrated implicit inversions. The three\nprofiles obtained above the rippled beds (M04\u2013M06) are\nsimilar in form and generally increase in magnitude with the\nsignificant wave height. All three rippled bed SSC profiles\nin Figure 9 exhibit a near\u2010exponential decay, of similar\ngradient, within the bottom 15 cm. An exponential function,\nof the form given by equation (8), was fitted to the con-\ncentration measurements within 0.02\u20130.12 m above the bed\nlevel. In the rippled bed cases, the resulting exponential\ndecay length scales, L, were between 0.06 and 0.07 m and\nthe reference concentrations, C0, obtained by extrapolating\nto the bed level, were between 1.5 and 2.2 kg m\u22123. These\nobservations of C0 are somewhat below predictions made\nusing equation (10) of Nielsen [1986], but are broadly\nwithin the scatter of data used by Nielsen [1986].\n[28] Predictions were made of the SSC profiles using\nequation (8) with L predicted by the formula of Nielsen\n[1992] (equation (11)) and C0 values from the data. In\nevaluating equation (11), the hydrodynamic (U0s) and bed\n(h0) conditions in Tables 1 and 2 were used along with the\nformula of Soulsby [1997] (equation (12)) for the sediment\nsettling velocities. In order to include the effect that the\ngrain size distribution had on the SSC profiles, the settling\nvelocity distribution was taken into account using the\nmethod outlined by Davies and Thorne [2002]. The size\ndistributions of the suspended sediment (Figure 7) were\ndivided into five volumetrically equal fractions and the SSC\nprofile for each of these fractions calculated. For all but the\nfinest fraction in each case U0s\/ws < 18, and in equation (11)\nFigure 8. Regression plot of the mean time average ABS, CA, and pumped sampled, CP, suspended sed-\niment concentrations with the curves corresponding to CA = CP (solid curve) and CA = 2CP and CA =\n0.5CP (dotted curves) shown. The error bars show \u00b1 the standard error of the mean of the three ABS fre-\nquencies for CA and \u00b120% for CP.\nO\u2019HARA MURRAY ET AL.: INTRAWAVE ENTRAINMENT ABOVE RIPPLES C01001C01001\n12 of 25\nL was a function of U0s. The predictions of the SSC profiles\nabove the rippled beds included in Figure 9 are the mean\naverages of the profiles calculated for each of the five size\nfractions. There is a slight departure from the exponential\ndecay of equation (8) due to the inclusion of the settling\nvelocity distribution. The characteristic decay length scale of\nthese predicted profiles differed from those observed by up\nto 40%. One reason for the disagreement between the pre-\ndictions and observations of C0 and L is the variation in\nvelocity amplitudes from wave\u2010to\u2010wave, that is, U0s may\nnot be a good representative velocity for the irregular wave\nfield. This variation in U0 from wave\u2010to\u2010wave influences the\nsediment entrainment process, which is the investigative\nfocus of this paper. Whether the entrainment of sediment\nwas dominated by the same process during the whole time\nperiod that the SSC profiles in Figure 9 were averaged over\nis an important consideration.\n4.4. Intrawave Water Velocities\n[29] The bed level during each experiment obtained from\nthe ARP and ABS records were in agreement and indicated\nthat the sampling volumes of ADV\u20101 and ADV\u20102 were\napproximately 0.5 and 0.1 m above the bed, respectively,\nduring the course of the rippled bed experiments (M04\u2013\nM06). During the fine\u2010medium\u2010grained plane bed experi-\nment, F08, the instrument frame settled into the bed such\nthat the sampling volume of ADV\u20101 was 0.35 m above the\nbed and that of ADV\u20102 was below bed level. Hence no data\nfrom ADV\u20102 gathered during F08 were used. For the rippled\nbed experiments, the near\u2010bed velocities from ADV\u20102 were\nused to identify the wave cycles in the phase\u2010locking\nanalysis of the SSC time series (section 4.5). In the case of\nF08, where the sampling volume of ADV\u20102 was below bed\nlevel, velocity data from ADV\u20101 were used.\n[30] Each time series component (obtained from the\nADVs at 16 Hz) was despiked using a phase\u2010space thresh-\nolding method [Goring and Nikora, 2002] with detected\nspikes replaced by linear interpolations using the sur-\nrounding data points and run for 10 iterations. The velocity\ncomponents were rotated to correct for any misalignment of\nthe instruments with the main flow directions. This was\ndone by considering each combination of two velocity\ncomponents in turn and then aligning one of the components\nwith the principle axis of variation [Emery and Thompson,\nFigure 9. Suspended sediment concentration profiles, C(z), for each experiment, mean time averaged\nover 17 minutes during which the pumped samples were collected, and mean averaged over the three\nABS frequencies. The standard error of the mean of the three ABS frequencies is shown as error bars\nfor the measurements taken during F08 and M06 in order to indicate typical measurement uncertainty\nthrough the profile. The empirical suspended sediment concentration (SSC) profile of Nielsen [1986]\nis shown for each rippled bed experiment, M04 (dash\u2010dotted curve), M05 (solid curve) and M06 (dot-\nted curve).\nO\u2019HARA MURRAY ET AL.: INTRAWAVE ENTRAINMENT ABOVE RIPPLES C01001C01001\n13 of 25\n1997]. The result was a fully rotated system of three\northogonal velocity components. Here, positive water par-\nticle velocities corresponding to the direction of wave\npropagation are referred to as onshore velocities and nega-\ntive water particle velocities toward the wave generator as\noffshore velocities. Following this convention the horizontal\nalong\u2010flume velocity component is referred to here as the\ncross\u2010shore component.\n[31] In order to determine the timing of each wave half\ncycle accurately, turbulent fluctuations were removed from\nthe cross\u2010shore ADV velocity time series by applying a\nrectangular low\u2010pass filter and a zero\u2010crossing analysis was\nused to identify the times of flow reversal. These filtered\ntime series were compared with the nonfiltered time series\nconfirming that no significant changes in amplitude and\nphase of the velocities occurred during the analysis. The\nzero\u2010up crossings were defined as the start of each wave\ncycle, and the orbital velocity amplitudes and orbital dia-\nmeters corresponding to each wave half cycle were sought.\nThe velocity amplitudes were taken as the maximum\nvelocity magnitude between successive zero\u2010crossings, and\nthe onshore and offshore velocity amplitudes, Uon and Uoff\nrespectively, were distinguished from one another. Figure\n10a shows approximately 30 seconds of the filtered\nADV\u20102 velocity time series from M04 with the Uon and\nUoff values for the second wave cycle indicated. The\nFigure 10. Five wave cycles (\u223c30 s) from M04 of (a) filtered ADV\u20102 velocity time series, (b) SSC in the\ntime t domain, (c) SSC in the phase \n domain, and (d) instantaneous reference concentration, c0(\n), as a\nfunction of \n. Each wave cycle is indicated by vertical dashed lines. In Figure 10a the onshore and off-\nshore orbital amplitudes, Uon and Uoff, respectively, and onshore and offshore orbital diameters, don and\ndoff, respectively, are defined for the second wave cycle. In Figures 10b and 10c the orbital ADV velocity,\nu, from Figure 10a is overlain. In Figure 10d the cycle mean reference concentration, c0\u00f0\n\u00de, for each wave\ncycle is shown in red.\nO\u2019HARA MURRAY ET AL.: INTRAWAVE ENTRAINMENT ABOVE RIPPLES C01001C01001\n14 of 25\norbital diameters were calculated by integrating the velocity\ntime series between successive zero\u2010crossings, and the\nonshore and offshore values, don and doff, respectively, were\ndistinguished from one another. For example, in Figure 10a\na zero\u2010up crossing occurs at time a, the subsequent zero\u2010\ndown crossing occurs at time b, and the orbital diameter\ncorresponding to this onshore wave half cycle can be cal-\nculated by\ndon \u00bc\nZb\na\nu t\u00f0 \u00dedt; \u00f018\u00de\nwhere u(t) is the time series of velocity, with u(t) > 0 in the\nonshore direction. The orbital diameter corresponding to the\nsubsequent offshore wave half cycle is calculated in a\nsimilar manner, as indicated in Figure 10a. This approach\nwas taken because the flow was irregular. If the flow was\nsinusoidal with period T and a velocity amplitude of U0, that\nis, if u(t) was replaced with U0sin(2pt\/T), then equation 18\nwould be equivalent to the more familiar equation of linear\nwave theory, U0T\/p. Following this zero\u2010crossing analysis,\na distribution of onshore and offshore velocity amplitudes\n(Uon and Uoff, respectively) and orbital diameters (don and\ndoff, respectively) were constructed for each experiment.\n4.5. Phase Ensemble Averaging the SSC\n[32] There is inherent variability in the ABS signal due to\nthe random, Rayleigh distributed, phasing of the acoustic\nreturns [Thorne et al., 1993]. This variability in the back-\nscatter signal was reduced significantly by averaging over\n32 independent measurements of acoustic backscatter, thus\nreducing the backscatter signal from 128 Hz to 4 Hz. The\nstandard error on such an average is a factor of\nffiffiffiffiffi\n32\np\nsmaller\nthan if no averaging were performed [Thorne and Hanes,\n2002].\n[33] Small scale sediment transport processes are highly\ninfluenced by the turbulent nature of the boundary layer\nflow over rough beds; hence, there is an intrinsic stochastic\nvariability in the SSC field. This is the case under both\nregular and irregular waves, but in the case of irregular\nwaves there is considerable variance in the near\u2010bed tur-\nbulence from wave\u2010to\u2010wave [Vincent and Hanes, 2002]. In\norder to observe consistent features in the intrawave SSC\nfield, ensemble averaging over a number of wave cycles was\ntherefore necessary.\n[34] Figure 10b shows a series of SSC profiles, with the\nheight above the bed, z, ranging from 0 to 20 cm, during five\nwave cycles (approximately 30 s) of M04 in the time\ndomain, with the filtered ADV velocity from Figure 10a\nsuperimposed. Each wave cycle was identified from the\nzero\u2010crossing and turning point time series analysis of the\nfiltered ADV velocity, and the wave cycles are distinguished\nin Figures 10a and 10b. Each wave cycle was defined to\nstart at the point of maximum velocity in the onshore\n(positive) direction. Using this definition allowed the sedi-\nment dynamics occurring around flow reversal to be clearly\nobservable within the wave cycle. The wave irregularity can\nbe observed in Figures 10a and 10b, both in terms of the\nwave amplitude and the wave period. Because the wave\nperiod varied from wave\u2010to\u2010wave, it was not possible to\nsimply ensemble average over recurrent time steps equal to\nthe wave period, as has been carried out under regular\noscillatory flow [Davies and Thorne, 2005; van der Werf et\nal., 2007]. Instead a procedure phase\u2010locking the ABS\nconcentration profiles with the ADV orbital velocities was\nperformed, so that the ensemble averaging could be carried\nout in the phase domain rather than the time domain. Figure\n10c shows the same series of SSC profiles and ADV\nvelocities as Figure 10b, but in the phase domain, and again,\nthe wave cycles (now equally spaced) are indicated. The\nresolution of the phase domain was 22.5\u00b0 (16 SSC profiles\nper wave cycle). Figure 10c shows five wave cycles of SSC\nprofiles in the phase domain for illustration only. The SSC\nprofile series considered for each experiment were the bursts\nidentified in section 4.2 during which the ABS was over a\nripple crest. There were between 50 and 100 wave cycles in\nthe SSC profile series for each rippled bed experiment, de-\npending on the length of the measurement burst. Figure 10d\nshows the instantaneous reference concentration, c0(\n),\nfor five wave cycles and will be discussed in section 4.6.\n[35] Figure 11a and Figures 11b\u201311d present the SSC\nresults above the flat bed and the three rippled beds,\nrespectively, phase ensemble averaged over the measure-\nment bursts. Figures 11a\u201311d show the underlying in-\ntrawave variation of the SSC with height above the bed and\nFigure 11e shows the corresponding phase ensemble aver-\naged orbital velocity, hui, for each experiment. There is a\nclear difference between the structure of the SSC field\nduring the flat bed (Figure 11a) and rippled bed experiments\n(Figures 11b\u201311d). Above the flat bed, the sediment con-\ncentration is high in the bottom 2 cm and decays abruptly\nabove this. There is also no significant intrawave variation\nin the SSC. Conversely, above the rippled beds the con-\ncentration decay rate is more gradational with distance from\nthe bed and there is a clear intrawave structure present with\npeaks in the sediment concentration occurring around flow\nreversal (90\u00b0 and 270\u00b0). The intrawave structure of the SSC\nis most similar during experiments M04 (Figure 11b) and\nM05 (Figure 11c) with the peaks in the concentration oc-\ncurring at the same phase angles and the concentrations\nthroughout the wave cycle being comparable. During M06\n(Figure 11d), the sediment concentration peaks earlier in the\nwave cycle than during the previous two experiments. In\nterms of SSC magnitude, at one ripple height above the\nrippled beds, the concentration peaks are between 1.01 and\n1.85 kg m\u22123 near the instances of flow reversal and con-\nsistently drop to below 0.34 kg m\u22123 near the instances of\nmaximum velocity.\n4.6. Bed Levels and Reference Concentrations\n[36] The ABS system allows for the accurate identifica-\ntion of the bed level directly below the transducers,\nknowledge of which is crucial for studying the dynamics of\nnear\u2010bed sediment suspensions. Measurement bursts were\nconsidered when a ripple crest was below the ABS and the\nbed levels were constant in time, that is, when there was no\nripple migration or bed evolution. These ABS backscatter\ntime series were compared across all three frequencies and\nwere found to increase exponentially toward the bed. The\nbed level was taken at the level of the first measurement\nsignificantly larger than the exponential trend. The instan-\ntaneous reference concentration as a function of phase,\nc0(\n), where \n is the phase angle, was taken at the bed level,\nO\u2019HARA MURRAY ET AL.: INTRAWAVE ENTRAINMENT ABOVE RIPPLES C01001C01001\n15 of 25\nwhich in the cases of the rippled beds was approximately the\nripple crest level. An exponential function, of the form given\nin equation (8), was fitted to the measurements of the SSC\nwithin 0.02\u20130.05 m above the bed level, and c0(\n) was\nobtained by extrapolation to the crest. This was done for\neach concentration profile within the 16 profiles per wave\ncycle phase\u2010series as described in section 4.5. Figure 10d\nshows the calculated instantaneous reference concentration\nas a function of phase (c0(\n)) for five wave cycles. For each\nwave cycle, the cycle mean reference concentration, c0\u00f0\n\u00de,\nwhere the over bar indicates an average over the wave cycle,\nis indicated. The c0\u00f0\n\u00de values were used to normalize the\ninstantaneous intrawave c0(\n) values within each wave\ncycle. This normalization from wave\u2010to\u2010wave within the\nirregular wave sequence enabled the underlying structure of\nthe intrawave reference concentration to be studied.\n[37] Figure 12 shows the phase ensemble averaged nor-\nmalized intrawave reference concentrations, hc0(\n)\/c0\u00f0\n\u00dei,\nfor each experiment, where the brackets, h i, indicate phase\nensemble averaging over 50\u2013100 wave cycles and the error\nbars show the standard error of the ensemble averages.\nConsidering the relative size of peaks in hc0(\n)\/c0\u00f0\n\u00dei and\nthe associated standard error, during an average wave cycle\nthe rippled bed cases (Figures 12b\u201312d) show two distinct\npeaks occurring around flow reversal (90\u00b0 and 270\u00b0).\nConversely, the flat bed case has smaller peaks occurring\naround peak flow when the shear stress is highest over the\nplane bed (Figure 12a). The relative amplitude of the peaks\nin the rippled bed experiments compare well and the timing\nof the peaks in experiments M04 and M05 compare well\n(with peaks occurring 24\u00b0 (onshore) and 11\u00b0 (offshore) after\nflow reversal). The peaks in hc0(\n)\/c0\u00f0\n\u00dei during M06, on\nthe other hand, preceded flow reversal by 34\u00b0.\n[38] Net suspended sediment flux calculations crucially\ndepend on the magnitude of the SSC in suspension which, in\nturn, depends on the reference concentration (i.e. equation\n(8)). Under irregular waves the instantaneous reference\nconcentration, c0(\n), and hence the cycle mean, c0\u00f0\n\u00de,\nvaries from wave\u2010to\u2010wave. Thus, the prediction of c0\u00f0\n\u00de\nunder irregular waves is important in the modeling of SSC\nprofiles within wave resolving process models such as the\n\u2018research\u2019 models studied by Davies et al. [2002].\nFigure 11.

The results shown are the\nmean concentrations from the 1 and 2 MHz ABS frequencies.\nO\u2019HARA MURRAY ET AL.: INTRAWAVE ENTRAINMENT ABOVE RIPPLES C01001C01001\n16 of 25\n[39] Here, for irregular waves, an approach similar to the\ntime average analysis used by Nielsen [1986] is adopted for a\nwave\u2010by\u2010wave analysis. For each wave cycle, the cycle\nmean ripple modified Shields parameter, \u0001r, was calculated\nusing equation (9), and by taking the wave orbital amplitude\nand diameter for each wave cycle, U0 and d0 respectively, as\nthe mean of the two half cycles, that is, U0 = 1=2(Uon + Uoff)\nand d0 = 1=2(don + doff). Figure 13 shows the cycle mean\nreference concentration, c0\u00f0\n\u00de, from each of the three rippled\nbed experiments (M04\u2013M06) plotted against \u0001r along with\nthe empirical equation of Nielsen [1986] (equation (10)). The\nc0\u00f0\n\u00de values shown are the mean of the values obtained from\nthe results of the 1 and 2 MHz ABS frequencies and the error\nbars show the standard error of the mean. The error bars of\nthe \u0001r values are the result of propagating the standard error\nof each quantity though equation (9). The majority of the\ndata compares reasonably well with the equation of Nielsen,\nthough with a few outliers. These outliers tend to correspond\nto wave half cycles where d0\/l0 < 1, below which flow\nseparation is not expected to occur [Malarkey and Davies,\n2002], and are indicated in Figure 13 with open circles. A\nlinear regression has been made in log\u2010log space on c0\u00f0\n\u00de\nand \u0001r, where d0\/l0 \u2265 1, yielding\nc0 \n\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 0:0116\u0005 0:0034\u00f0 \u00de\u0007s\u00013:50\u00050:32r ; \u00f019\u00de\nwith a correlation coefficient R2 = 0.78. Equation (19)\nbroadly agrees with the equation of Nielsen [1986]\n(equation (10)), in terms of the approximate cubic relation\nbetween c0\u00f0\n\u00de and \u0001r. The coefficient is somewhat larger\nthan that of Nielsen. The difference between equation (19)\nand that of Nielsen [1986] may be due to the fact that\ncycle mean reference concentrations, rather than time aver-\nage reference concentrations, are presented here and that our\nregression was on data where d0\/l0 \u2265 1.\n5. Investigating the Vortex Shedding Regime\n[40] Equation (7) relates the relative roughness of the bed,\nd0\/2ks, to the parameter d0\/l which Malarkey and Davies\n[2002] used as a parameterization of the sediment suspen-\nsion process, namely vortex shedding. The d0\/2ks values of\nthe rippled bed found in section 4.2 fall within the secondary\nvortex shedding criteria of Malarkey and Davies [2002]\nsuggesting that vortex shedding should have occurred dur-\ning these experiments.\n[41] The peaks in the ensemble averaged intrawave SSC\nin Figure 11 and the reference concentration in Figure 12\ncoincide. Over the rippled beds, these peaks occur around\nflow reversal and can be interpreted as a signature of flow\nseparation and the process of vortex shedding. Figures 11\nand 12 are phase ensemble averages over full wave cycles\nFigure 12. Phase ensemble averaged normalized intrawave reference concentrations, hc0(\n)\/c0\u00f0\n\u00dei. The\nensemble averaging, h i, is over all wave cycles during (a) plane and (b\u2013d) rippled bed conditions. The\nerror bars show the standard error of the ensemble averaging. Both c0(\n) and c0\u00f0\n\u00de were calculated from\nmean concentration values from the 1 and 2 MHz ABS frequencies.\nO\u2019HARA MURRAY ET AL.: INTRAWAVE ENTRAINMENT ABOVE RIPPLES C01001C01001\n17 of 25\nand indicate the average response of the suspended sedi-\nments to the irregular wave forcing. Under regular waves,\nensemble averaging helps to reveal the underlying sediment\ntransport phenomena, due to the sediment entrainment\nprocess being repeated every wave cycle. However, under\nthe irregular waves used in the present study, the situation\nwas more complicated since each wave was different and\ntherefore less consistency was expected in the suspended\nsediment field from wave\u2010to\u2010wave. The reason for this\nvariability between wave cycles was because the d0\/l\nparameter varied from wave\u2010to\u2010wave and was not sufficient\nunder every wave for the vortex shedding process to occur\n(i.e. the vortex shedding criteria of Malarkey and Davies\n[2002]), 1 \u2264 d0\/l \u2264 4, was not fulfilled under every wave.\nThis can alternatively be thought of as a disequilibrium\nbetween the flow and bed forms during some wave cycles.\nDespite this, the ensemble averaged results in Figures 11\nand 12 show an intrawave variation of the suspended sedi-\nment field consistent with that which occurs above ripples\nand under regular oscillatory flow on average [i.e. Davies\nand Thorne, 2005; van der Werf et al., 2007]. However,\none must be aware that the ensemble average results\n(Figures 11 and 12) have been phase ensemble averaged\nover both vortex shedding and nonvortex shedding events,\nbut that the vortex shedding events dominate and are thus\nrevealed through ensemble averaging.\n[42] In this section, the dependence of vortex shedding on\nthe parameter d0\/l, inherently linked to the relative rough-\nness of the bed (equation (7)), is investigated by examining\nthe phase ensemble averaged intrawave variations in the\nreference concentration during a number of intervals of d0\/\nl0, where d0 refers to either don or doff and l0 is the mea-\nsured wavelength of the ripple below the ABS (Table 2).\n[43] For each of the three rippled bed experiments the\ndistributions of d0\/l0 were divided into classes of width d0\/\nl0 = 0.2. Phase ensemble averages of c0(\n)\/c0\u00f0\n\u00de were\ntaken over the wave half cycles within each class to yield\nphase ensemble averages over half wave cycles within a\ndiscrete class of d0\/l0. This was carried out for both for\nonshore (don\/l) and offshore (doff\/l) distributions and for\neach of the three ripple bed experiments in turn. By exam-\nining hc0(\n)\/c0\u00f0\n\u00dei in each discrete class of d0\/l, it was\nidentified that the vortex shedding signature, identified as a\ndistinct peak in hc0(\n)\/c0\u00f0\n\u00dei around flow reversal, was\nconsistently only present in those classes where d0\/l0 \u2265 1.2.\nThis was true for both onshore and offshore wave half cy-\ncles. Figures 14a\u201314d show phase ensemble averages of the\nnormalized reference concentration for onshore and offshore\nwave half cycles where don\/off\/l0 < 1.2 and don\/off\/l0 \u2265 1.2.\nThe upper limit, at which vortex shedding ceases to occur,\nhas not been examined because there were insufficient wave\nhalf cycles where d0 > 4l for any meaningful conclusions to\nFigure 13.

The c0\u00f0\n\u00de is the mean of the\nresults from the 1 and 2 MHz ABS frequencies and the error bars are the associated standard error. The\nerror bars for \u0001r shows the standard error due to the wave asymmetry and the uncertainty in ripple steep-\nness. Those points corresponding to wave half cycles where d0\/l0 < 1, where d0 = 1=2(don + doff) and l0 is\nthe wavelength of the ripple below the ABS, are indicated with open circles. The predictor of Nielsen\n[1986] is shown (dash\u2010dotted curve) together with the results of a regression analysis (solid curve)\nperformed on those values corresponding to wave half cycles where d0\/l0 \u2265 1.\nO\u2019HARA MURRAY ET AL.: INTRAWAVE ENTRAINMENT ABOVE RIPPLES C01001C01001\n18 of 25\nbe drawn. When d0\/l0 < 1.2 (Figures 14a and 14b), hc0(\n)\/\nc0\u00f0\n\u00dei shows no coherent structure through the wave half\ncycle, whereas when d0\/l0 \u2265 1.2 (Figures 14c and 14d),\nhc0(\n)\/c0\u00f0\n\u00dei exhibits distinct peaks around flow reversal.\nTherefore, d0\/l = 1.2 is interpreted here as a threshold below\nwhich flow separation does not occur and above which it\ndoes and the process of vortex formation and shedding\ndominates the suspension of sediment.

This is most likely due to the asymmetry of the\nTable 3.

To investigate\nthis, the mean of the onshore and offshore velocity ampli-\ntudes were calculated (Uon and Uoff , Table 3). These results\ndemonstrate the onshore velocity amplitude was on average\n1.2 times larger across all three experiments. Such asym-\nmetry in the velocity field, and the associated dominant\nsediment pickup after the onshore wave half cycles, has\nstrong implications in terms of the net cross\u2010shore sediment\ntransport over vortex ripples. This is because the suspended\nsediment picked up after the onshore wave half cycle is\ntransported offshore during the offshore wave half cycle\n[Bijker et al., 1976].\n[45] Whether the occurrence of vortex shedding can be\nrelated to statistical representations of wave forcing, such as\nHs or d0s obtained by spectral analysis of the velocity or\nsurface wave fields, is an important issue as it has direct\nmodeling implications. Table 3 shows d0s\/l0, where d0s is\nthe significant orbital diameter from Table 1, for each\nexperiment. The fraction of wave half cycles where don\/l0 \u2265\n1.2 or doff\/l0 \u2265 1.2 were a consistent fraction of d0s\/l0.\nTaking the average of these fractions gives the percentage of\nwave half cycles where vortex shedding occurs as (26 \u00b1 1)\nd0s\/l0.\n[46] Finally, in order to further examine the threshold\nvalue of d0\/l = 1.2 obtained through examination of the\nintrawave reference concentrations, phase ensemble avera-\nges of the SSC field were taken over wave cycles where d0\/\nl0 < 1.2 and d0\/l0 \u2265 1.2, respectively, and where d0 = 1=2(don\n+ doff).

The important feature\npresent in Figure 15 is the clear difference in the phase\nensemble averaged SSC fields, both in terms of magnitude\nand intrawave structure, between wave cycles where d0\/l0 <\n1.2 and where d0\/l0 \u2265 1.2. These results are consistent with\nthe intrawave structure of the reference concentrations in\nFigure 14 and confirms that below irregular waves, d0\/l =\n1.2 is a suitable threshold above which vortex formation and\nshedding become the dominant mechanism of sediment\nsuspension above ripples.\n6. Discussion\n[47] Four experiments conducted in the Deltaflume under\nirregular wave forcing have been presented. Particular\nattention has been paid to the wave forcing, bed forms, fluid\nvelocities, suspended sediment concentrations, and refer-\nence concentrations. In particular, the variation of the sus-\npended sediment fields and fluid velocities on an intrawave\ntime scale were studied here. During the first experiment,\nwhere D50 = 258 mm, the significant wave height, Hs, was\n1.45 m and the shallow (nonvortex shedding) ripples present\nduring previous wave forcing regimes (with smaller Hs)\nwere washed out. The sediment dynamics above this bed\nthus approached that of a dynamically (upper stage) plane\nbed. During the latter three experiments, where D50 =\n375 mm and Hs = 0.64\u20131.05 m, a (steep sided vortex\nshedding) rippled bed formed. These four experiments were\nchosen primarily so that two contrasting bed and sedi-\nment dynamics regimes, from those portrayed in Figure 1,\ncould be presented. The sediment dynamics under different\ndynamic, but not strongly contrasting, flow conditions were\nstudied, under which substantial sediment transport was\nexpected. F08 enabled the sediment dynamics above a plane\nupper\u2010stage bed to be observed and contrasted with that\noccurring above the rippled beds of M04\u2013M06.\n6.1. Bed Forms\n[48] During the measurement bursts considered there was\nlittle or no change in the bed morphology. For example,\nduring the rippled bed bursts there was no significant ripple\nmigration or evolution in terms of ripple amplitude or height\nchanges. Why there was no ripple migration observed dur-\ning these bursts is an obvious question especially as ripples\nwere observed to migrate as much as one ripple wavelength\nin 17 minutes in the Deltaflume under regular waves\n[Davies and Thorne, 2005]. This is interpreted to be related\nto the irregular wave forcing. Faraci and Foti [2002]\nshowed that the ripple migration rate is influenced by the\nirregularity of the flow and that higher migration rates occur\nunder regular waves. Traykovski et al. [1999] found the\naverage onshore migration rate of ripples in a field envi-\nronment to be 24 cm d\u22121. Such migration rates would be\nunobserved over the length of the bursts considered in these\nexperiments; hence, the nonmigration of the ripples over\nthese time scales is not unexpected. The irregularity of the\nwaves also explains why there was little evolution of the\nripple geometry during the measurement bursts here: under\nirregular waves, where there is less of a dominant orbital\nlength scale than under regular waves, ripples tend to remain\nin an initial configuration or evolve more slowly than under\nregular waves [Marsh et al., 1999].\n[49] Orbital ripples scale with the diameter of orbital\nmotion, d0, close to the bed [Clifton, 1976]. While the rip-\nples observed here lie in the suborbital regime [Wiberg and\nHarris, 1994], it is still useful to compare their wavelength\nto d0, as d0 has a strong influence on their geometry. Miller\nand Komar [1980] proposed that the wavelength of orbital\nripples was l = 0.65d0 and Wiberg and Harris [1994] later\nreported l = 0.62d0. These two results give d0\/l = 1.5 and\n1.6 which are larger than the value of d0\/l = 1.2 for the\ninitiation of vortex shedding found here, but is well within\nthe range of values where vortex shedding is expected, ac-\ncording to the criteria of Malarkey and Davies [2002]. The\nfact that the parameter d0\/l can be used both for the pre-\ndiction of bed morphology [Miller and Komar, 1980;\nWiberg and Harris, 1994] and the process of sediment\nentrainment illustrates the inherent link between bed mor-\nphology and the sediment entrainment process. Further-\nmore, d0\/l is inherently linked to the equivalent roughness\nof vortex ripples by equation (7).\n[50] The bed roughness, which is heavily dependent on\nthe ripple dimensions, is an important consideration when\nmodeling boundary layer flows [Davies and Thorne, 2008]\nand, in many cases, must be predicted from knowledge of\nthe predominant flow conditions and bed sediments. Thus,\nripple geometry prediction under waves is an active research\narea and a number of prediction schemes and formulae exist,\nbased on parameters such as the orbital diameter charac-\nterizing the flow [e.g., Mogridge et al., 1994; Wiberg and\nHarris, 1994; Soulsby and Whitehouse, 2005]. It was\ninteresting therefore to compare the results of such predic-\ntion schemes with the direct measurements of ripples here,\nto provide insight into the expected bed form and sediment\nsuspension conditions under the Deltaflume oscillatory\nflow.\n[51] The suborbital regime defined by Wiberg and Harris\n[1994] can be expressed as 1800 < d0\/D50 < 5500. Ripples\nwith d0\/D50 smaller than 1800 or larger than 5500 are\ntherefore within the orbital and anorbital regimes, respec-\ntively. The d0s\/D50 values for the Deltaflume experiments\nare listed in Table 1 and show that the flat bed (F08) and\nrippled beds (M04\u2013M06) are within the suborbital and an-\norbital regimes, respectively. Using the significant orbital\ndiameters and peak spectral periods from Table 1, the pre-\ndiction formulae of Mogridge et al. [1994], Wiberg and\nHarris [1994], and Soulsby and Whitehouse [2005] were\napplied to the flow conditions during the Deltaflume bursts\nto find expected values for the ripple dimensions, the ripple\nwavelength, height, and steepness. The results are listed in\nTable 4. In Table 4 lM, hM, and hM\/lM are the dimensions of\nO\u2019HARA MURRAY ET AL.: INTRAWAVE ENTRAINMENT ABOVE RIPPLES C01001C01001\n21 of 25\nthe ripples according to the predictor of Mogridge et al.\n[1994], lW, hW, and hW\/lW are the dimensions of the rip-\nples according to the predictor of Wiberg and Harris [1994]\nand lS, hS, and hS\/lS are the dimensions of the ripples ac-\ncording to the predictor of Soulsby and Whitehouse [2005].\nAll these predictors are based on large amounts of data, and\nshould therefore be most comparable with the spatial and\ntemporal averages of the ripple dimensions measured using\nthe ARP, l, h, and h\/l in Table 2. However, all the pre-\ndictions of the ripple height were 1.2\u20133.5 times larger than\nthe measured spatial and temporal averages (h, Table 2) and\nall the predictions of the ripple steepness were 1.5\u20132.3 times\nlarger than h\/l (Table 2). Similarly, for the flow conditions\nduring M04 and M05, the predictions of the ripple wave-\nlengths were 1.4\u20132.0 l. The predictions of the ripple\nwavelength during the M06 flow conditions were generally\nmore accurate with values ranging from 0.9\u20131.4 l. Finally,\nTable 4 shows the results using the flow conditions during\nF08, where a reasonably plane bed was known to exist. The\nresults all predict shallow ripples with heights in the range\n0.3\u20131.5 cm, an order of magnitude smaller than the ripples\nknown to be present during the rippled bed experiments\n(M04\u2013M06). However, the wavelengths of 0.12\u20130.35 m\nwere significantly shorter than the long wavelength bed\nform observed in Figure 4a. Overall, the predictor of\nSoulsby and Whitehouse [2005] predicted ripple dimensions\nmost in line with those observed here. The predicted ripple\nwavelengths were 0.9\u20131.4 l, the predicted ripple heights\nwere 1.2\u20132.1 h, and the predicted ripple steepness values\nwere 1.5\u20131.7 h\/l. The discrepancy between the predicted\nand observed ripple dimensions is here attributed to the fact\nthat only three rippled beds were examined here and that the\nsignificant wave orbital diameters and peak spectral wave\nperiods from Table 1 are not necessarily the best parame-\nterization of the irregular wave fields. Furthermore, Hanes et\nal. [2001] found that ripple measurements from three field\ncampaigns were approximately within a factor of two of\nthose given by ripple prediction schemes.\n6.2. Timings of Peak Sediment Entrainment\n[52] The most striking similarity between the three rippled\nbed experiments is the ensemble averaged intrawave SSC\nfields (Figures 11b\u201311d) and reference concentrations\n(Figures 12b\u201312d), in terms of timing and magnitude. It is\nwell\u2010established that under regular waves and over a bed\nwith steep ripples, sediment laden vortices are ejected over\nthe ripple crest around the instances of flow reversal and that\npeaks in the SSC occur at these times above the ripple crest\n[e.g., Davies and Thorne, 2005; van der Werf et al., 2007].\nTherefore, the clear peaks observed here, under irregular\nwaves, in the ensemble averaged intrawave SSC (Figure 11)\nand reference concentrations (Figure 12) near the instants of\nflow reversal support the concept of the process of vortex\nshedding taking place under irregular waves.\n[53] While peaks in the SSC occurred around flow\nreversal during each of the rippled bed experiments, there\nare differences in the precise timing of the SSC peaks. The\nphase at which hc0(\n)\/c0\u00f0\n\u00dei peaks in M04 and M05 com-\npare well and occur between 11\u00b0\u201324\u00b0 after flow reversal,\nbroadly agreeing with the results of van der Werf et al.\n[2007], whereas the hc0(\n)\/c0\u00f0\n\u00dei peaks in M06 precede\nflow reversal by 34\u00b0. A similar phenomenon was observed\nabove the crests of vortex ripples by Block et al. [1994]\nbeneath regular waves in a large flume tank (97 m long).\nBlock et al. [1994] observed the SSC to peak (1) 10\u00b0\u201320\u00b0\nafter flow reversal when h\/l = 0.16 and d0\/l = 1.62 and (2)\n20\u00b0 before flow reversal when h\/l = 0.11 and d0\/l = 2.63.\nThis phase shift was attributed to the difference in the d0\/l\nparameterization [Block et al., 1994]. The phase shift\nobserved here between M04 and M06 is of a similar mag-\nnitude to that observed by Block et al. [1994], but the d0s\/l0\nvalue during M06 is smaller than that during M04. The\nripple measured below the ABS during M06 was larger than\nthe majority of ripples present on the bed at the time. The\nbed morphology was also dominantly three\u2010dimensional\nduring M06 and the bed forms may not have been truly in\nequilibrium with the flow. Perhaps, therefore, the l0 length\nscale was an inappropriate choice for the case of the M06\nexperiment. Using instead the spatially averaged ripple\nwavelength, l in Table 2, produces d0s\/l = 4.18 which is\nlarger than that during M04 and therefore more consistent\nwith the result of Block et al. [1994].\n6.3. Implications\n[54] The occurrence of the process of vortex shedding is\nwell\u2010established under regular oscillatory flow [e.g., Davies\nand Thorne, 2005; van der Werf et al., 2007] but is not well\u2010\nverified under irregular waves at field scale. This work\nverifies, under field scale irregular waves, the process of\nvortex shedding not only occurs, but can be a dominant\nmechanism of sediment suspension during both onshore and\noffshore wave half cycles. When modeling sediment fluxes,\nthe prediction of the sediment suspension under waves can\nhave a profound effect, that is, wave asymmetry can lead to\nthe process of vortex shedding encouraging offshore\npumping of sediment [Bijker et al., 1976; Davies and\nThorne, 2008]. Such an asymmetry in the intrawave\nvelocity was observed here contributing to 12% more vor-\ntices being generated during the onshore wave half cycles\nbeneath irregular waves. Therefore it is important for the\nprocess of vortex shedding to be considered within models\nof larger scale sediment transport. Commonly, the only\nreadily available information about the hydrodynamic and\nsediment transport regime at a field location is the wave\nclimate which, for simplicity, is often expressed in terms of\nTable 4.

Hs can readily be used to estimate an equiv-\nalent significant velocity amplitude U0s [Wiberg and\nSherwood, 2008] or significant orbital diameter d0s close\nto the bed, which in turn can be related to vortex shedding\nwith the parameter d0s\/l, where l is the characteristic ripple\nwavelength. The dependency of the occurrence of vortex\nshedding on d0s\/l has been examined here under irregular\nwaves. It has been found that the percentage of waves as-\nsessed as vortex shedding approximately scales as 26 d0s\/l\nover steep vortex ripples. Furthermore, d0s can be directly\nrelated to the significant wave height and peak spectral\nperiod using a relation based on linear wave theory\n(equation (16)). Thus, these observations on the frequency\nof vortex shedding events under irregular waves could serve\nas a practical assessment of vortex shedding within sediment\ntransport models reliant on parameters such as Hs.\n7. Conclusions\n[55] The results presented here were achieved by making\nacoustic measurements, on an intrawave time scale, of the\nsediment suspensions under JONSWAP irregular waves\nover both plane and rippled beds, under different significant\nwave heights. A striking difference between the intrawave\nstructure of the suspended sediments over a plane bed and\nrippled beds was observed. Over the rippled beds, the results\ndemonstrate a clear suspended sediment structure consistent\nwith lee\u2010wake vortex shedding previously observed under\nregular waves [Davies and Thorne, 2005]. Even though the\nsignificant wave height was different in each rippled bed\nexperiment, the intrawave structure and magnitudes of the\nSSC were remarkably similar. This consistency is ascribed\nto the similarity in the bed forms present (namely ripples\nwith h\/l > 0.1 where boundary layer separation and vortex\nshedding can occur) rather than simply the wave forcing.\nThis study establishes that vortex shedding occurs under\nfield scale irregular free surface waves, with vortex shed-\nding occurring under a percentage of the waves that appears\nto scale with the ratio of significant orbital diameter to ripple\nwavelength, d0s\/l, by a factor of \u223c26. Furthermore, it was\nconsistently observed that around 12% more vortex shed-\nding events occurred after onshore wave half cycles than\nafter offshore wave half cycles. This was due to wave\nasymmetry, and could lead to substantial offshore sus-\npended sediment transport over longer time scales than the\nduration of the experiment. Malarkey and Davies [2002]\nsuggest 1 \u2264 d0\/l \u2264 4, equivalently expressed as 4.3 \u2264 d0\/\n2ks \u2264 17.4 using equation (4) with h\/l = 0.12 and a = 8, as a\nvortex shedding regime. The lower limit was tested here\nunder irregular waves and a threshold value d0\/l = 1.2,\nabove which vortex shedding was a dominant entrainment\nprocess, was found. These results could serve as a practical\nassessment of vortex shedding within sediment transport\nmodels reliant on parameters such as the significant wave\nheight, which can be related to d0s.\n[56] The use of acoustics is proving to be a powerful tool\nin the study of near\u2010bed sediment dynamics. These con-\nclusions are based on results from one\u2010dimensional, vertical,\nmeasurements, over ripple crests, of SSC and point mea-\nsurements of the near\u2010bed flow. In recent years, acoustic\ntechnology has advanced and it is now possible to make\ndetailed, collocated, one\u2010dimensional measurements of the\nbed, the flow, and the suspended sediments at high temporal\nand spatial resolutions [e.g., Thorne et al., 2009b]. In the\nfuture, these techniques will be applied in increasingly more\nnatural environments, such as large scale flumes, as well as\nthe field. Further insight will be gained into the complex\nsediment transport processes occurring at small spatial and\ntemporal scales within rough boundary layers predominant\nin the coastal marine environment.\nNotation\nSymbol Description [dimensions] (typical units)\nHs significant wave height [L] (m)\nTp peak spectral wave period [T] (s)\nd0 wave orbital excursion diameter [L] (m)\nd0s significant wave orbital excursion diameter\n[L] (m)\nU0 wave orbital amplitude [L T\n\u22121] (m s\u22121)\nUon onshore wave orbital amplitude [L T\n\u22121]\n(m s\u22121)\nUoff offshore wave orbital amplitude [L T\n\u22121]\n(m s\u22121)\nU0s significant wave orbital amplitude [L T\n\u22121]\n(m s\u22121)\nh water depth [L] (m)\nl spatially and temporally averaged ripple\nwavelength [L] (m)\nh spatially and temporally averaged ripple\nheight [L] (m)\nh\/l spatially and temporally averaged ripple\nsteepness [\u2212]\nl0 temporally averaged wavelength of ripple\nbelow the ARP [L] (m)\nh0 temporally averaged height of the ripple\nbelow the ARP [L] (m)\nh0\/l0 temporally averaged steepness of the ripple\nbelow the ARP [\u2212]\nks equivalent roughness [L] (m)\nd0\/2ks relative roughness [\u2212]\n\u0001 skin friction Shields parameter [\u2212]\n\u00012.5 grain roughness Shields parameter based on\nks = 2.5D50 [\u2212]\n\u0001r ripple modified Shields parameter [\u2212]\nf2.5 wave friction factor based on ks = 2.5D50 [\u2212]\nu*2.5 shear velocity (skin friction) calculated\nusing f2.5\ns ratio of sediment density to water density [\u2212]\nrs sediment density [M L\n\u22123] (kg m\u22123)\ng acceleration due to gravity [L T\u22122] (m s\u22122)\nDi grain diameter for which i% of sediment is\nfiner than [L] (mm)\nDs50 median grain diameter of suspended sedi-\nment mass size distribution [L] (mm)\nas grain radius [L] (mm)\nhasi mean radius of the suspended sediment par-\nticle number size distribution [L] (mm)\nD* dimensionless grain size [\u2212]\nO\u2019HARA MURRAY ET AL.: INTRAWAVE ENTRAINMENT ABOVE RIPPLES C01001C01001\n23 of 25\nC(z) time average suspended sediment concentra-\ntion profile [M L\u22123] (kg m\u22123)\nz height above bed [L] (m)\nL vertical decay length scale [L] (m)\nC0 time averaged mass reference concentration\n[M L\u22123] (kg m\u22123)\nt time [T] (s)\n\n phase angle (degrees).
