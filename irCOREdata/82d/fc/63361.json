Recently, Kingsolver and\nPfennig [2] and Hone and Benton [3] suggested that such\na tendency is due to the fact that large body sizes provide a\ngeneral increase in individual fitness.\nWithout questioning the validity of the results presented\nby Kingsolver and Pfennig, or the convincing remarks of\nHone and Benton, we would like to highlight evidence that\npredator species do not always fit the large-size = high-fitness\nmechanism for Cope\u2019s rule. Although Kingsolver and Pfen-\nnig presented several potential biases that could have oc-\ncurred in the database they used for the review, they con-\ncluded that the generality of the pattern they observed was\nnot an artefact of studying particular species. However, none\nof the 39 species included in Kingsolver and Pfennig\u2019s analy-\nsis was a mammalian or avian predator.\nWe consider that directional selection favouring larger\nsize through fitness effects may be primarily a product of diet\nin predators. Predators are frequently strongly dependent on\nspecific prey types, and hence face great pressures to adapt\nto stochastic or human-induced alterations of ecosystems.\nMoreover, complex prey-predator relationships can reverse\nthe postulated positive correlations between size and either\nsurvival, mating success, or fecundity. We are conscious of\nthe scarcity of information on size tendency in the evolution-\nary lineages of predator species, as well as on the relationships\nbetween their size and fitness, but we consider it important\nto point out two illustrative cases contrary to the pattern pre-\ndicted by Cope\u2019s rule.\nWith a wingspan and a body weight that may attain more\nthan 150 cm and 2500 g, respectively, the Eurasian Eagle Owl\nBubo bubo is among the largest owls of the northern hemi-\nsphere and the largest owl ever to have lived [4]. But dur-\ning the Middle Pleistocene (Mindel glaciation), eagle owls\nof southern France were 6\u201310% larger than recent individ-\nuals [Bubo bubo davidi; C. Mourer-Chauvire\u00b4, PhD Thesis,\nUniversity of Claude Bernard, Lyon, 1975] and a still larger\nBubo binagadensis existed even later (upper Pleistocene) in\nthe Caucasian province of Azerbaijan [4]. All of ancient, large\nBubo owls seem to have been mammal hunters and the de-\ncline of the mammal fauna since the Tertiary has been con-\nsidered the main cause of the size decrease of the Eurasian\neagle owl\u2019s ancestors; moreover, it has been suggested that\nthe present species may continue on this evolutionary trend\nof decreasing size [8].\nDiet-associated size decrease in predator species is also\nevident as a current evolutionary phenomenon. Over recent\ndecades, grouse populations in Finland showed an important\nhuman-induced decrease. Before this decrease, grouse rep-\nresented the main prey of Finland goshawks, Accipiter gen-\ntilis (an avian predator with reversed-size dimorphism), for\n2 Research Letters in Ecology\nwhich the diet shifted toward smaller prey. As a consequence,\nsex-specific changes in morphology occurred. In particu-\nlar, as a result of selective pressures due to changes in diet,\nmales became smaller and females larger [5]. That is, because\nmales provide most food from the beginning of breeding\nuntil fledging, small individuals may best be able to replace\ngrouse with smaller birds andmammals. In contrast, because\nwinter prey availability probably represents the most limit-\ning factor for females (which do not hunt until late in the\nfledging period), an increase in female size may be beneficial\nfor preying upon adult hares (much larger than grouse), the\ntypical most profitable prey in their winter [5]. We (a work\nin preparation) recently detected that small size of individual\nmale goshawks in a Swedish area with small preys was pos-\nitively correlated with breeding performance (i.e., individ-\nual fitness): the smallest males fledged heavier males [GLM\nwith nestling weight as a dependent variable-Poisson distri-\nbution, log link- and male-wing length (parameter estimate\n\u00b1SE = \u22120.027 \u00b1 0.003; \u03c72 = 4.96; P = .026) and territory\nin the rabbit-rich or poor area (parameter estimate \u00b1SE =\n\u22120.070 \u00b1 0.036; \u03c72 = 6.42; P = .01) as explanatory vari-\nables; intercept estimate\u00b1SE = 15.398\u00b11.113% deviance ex-\nplained = 37.1%]. Our results suggest that small males were\nmost fit within the rabbit-poor area, where small individ-\nuals may be more efficient in replacing rabbits by hunting\nsmall- and medium-size birds, and shorter wings may facil-\nitate them in pursuing birds within forest stands or close to\nwoodland edges, typical hunting habitats of goshawks [6, 7].\nAlthough Kingsolver and Pfennig convincingly showed\nthe validity of the Cope\u2019s rule for plant and animal species\nother than predators, the examples above raise two other is-\nsues. First, we would add that a strong examination of preda-\ntor species, originally or human-induced \u201crestricted feed-\ners,\u201d would also result in a more complete understanding of\nfitness-dependent lineage size evolution. Finally, we specu-\nlate that if lineage size evolution of predators is driven by\nchanges in size of prey, the same may be true for herbivores,\nwith Cope\u2019s rule mainly an effect of selection on plants to\noutgrow the reach of herbivores. Given the specific require-\nments of predators and the complexity of prey-predator re-\nlationships, any analysis that does not tally all animal groups\nmay overlook a significant portion of evolutive trends. For\nthis reason, the scarce information available on predator evo-\nlutionary patterns indicates that generalisations are not al-\nways possible and, above all, they may not be possible re-\ngardless of taxa.\nREFERENCES\n[1] E.
