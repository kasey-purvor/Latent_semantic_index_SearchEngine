Reading Romans a\nhundred years after Charles Gore*\nN. T. Wright\nWestminster Abbey, 3 Little Cloister, London SW1P 3PL, UK Tom.Wright@westminster-abbey.org\nAbstract\nCharles Gore's two-volume commentary on Romans (1899, 1900) showed his\nheartfelt delight in the grace and love of God. Gore questions whether Luther had\nreally understood Paul, thus in certain respects anticipating the so-called `new\nperspective' of E. P. Sanders and others. He manages, in a way that Sanders does\nnot, to hold together `justi\u00aecation' and `being in Christ', though he does not integrate\nthese with Romans 9\u00b111. When we today explore Paul more fully, we see that\nRomans was yet more integrated than Gore had realised, and that two of Gore's\nprincipal emphases, the vital importance of holiness and the social and political\ndimensions of the gospel, have a more solid exegetical basis than he realised.\n1. Introduction\nMy title re\u00afects a famous conversation between Charles Gore and William\nTemple. Temple himself describes it like this: `Bishop Gore once said to me\nthat he paid visits to St. John as to a fascinating foreign country, but he\ncame home to St. Paul. With me the precise opposite is true.'1 But which\nPaul was it to whom Charles Gore came home?\nA hundred years ago Gore was a canon of Westminster, living with his\nsmall community at 4 Little Cloister. In addition to his many other interests,\nhe gave himself energetically during his eight years as a canon to the public\nexposition of scripture. He published the results in books on the Sermon on\nthe Mount, on the Epistle to the Ephesians, and then, in 1899 and 1900, his\ntwo volumes on Romans. He was in his middle forties, a seasoned scholar, a\npassionate preacher, a controversial \u00aegure in church and theology, with a\nChristian social conscience of unusual intensity. We don't have to hunt far\nin his commentary on Romans to discover the principles from which such a\nlife sprang.\nGore himself would urge us not to focus on his writings for their own\n392\n* The Charles Gore Lecture 2000. Westminster Abbey, 14 November 2000.\n1 William Temple, Readings in St. John's Gospel (First and Second Series) (London: Macmillan,\n1945 [1939]), p. vi. He tells the same story in slightly different words in his `Epilogue'\nto A. Mansbridge, Edward Stuart Talbot and Charles Gore (London: Dent, 1935), p. 90. A\ndifferent version again is reported in F. A. Iremonger, William Temple, Archbishop of\nCanterbury: His Life and Letters (London: OUP, 1948), p. 176.\nSJT 55(4): 392\u00b1407 (2002) Printed in the United Kingdom# 2002 Scottish Journal of Theology Ltd\nsake, but to learn afresh from Paul. This is a task many Anglicans \u00aend\ndaunting, and many downright distasteful. As Gore says on the \u00aerst page of\nthe commentary, Romans `is still . . . viewed with discomfort and neglected\nby those who most value the name of Catholic' \u00b1 and, we would have to\nadd, a good many others as well.2 I wish this was because, like Temple,\nthey visited Paul with a sense of strange beauty but came home to St John; I\nfear it is rather because today people visit both Paul and John with a sense of\nreluctant duty and come home to the television.\nIn this lecture I shall describe the main points of Gore's commentary on\nRomans, calling attention to three features of his interpretation where, I\nshall argue, he had rightly guessed at Paul's deeper meaning without yet\nseeing how the text of the letter could actually get him there. I shall then\nsuggest, with a very broad brush, that advances in Pauline scholarship since\nGore's day help us to do with more exegetical thoroughness what he was\nwanting to do. When we in turn `come home' to St Paul a century after\nCharles Gore, we \u00aend in the apostle more, not less, than the canon had\nseen. We may, perhaps, in the words of a poet 12 years old when Gore\nwrote his commentary, arrive where we started, and know the place for the\n\u00aerst time.\n2. Gore's Romans: issues and questions\nGore's commentary is written at a popular level. It is lively, occasionally\nsermonic, and peppered with illustration and application. The underlying\nscholarship peeps out in the notes: he knows the fathers, and has read\nLightfoot, Westcott and Hort, and of course the then recently published\nSanday and Headlam. He refers to Ritschl and other Germans from time to\ntime. He makes use of intertestamental Jewish texts. But none of this\ntroubles the general reader. The line of exposition is clear and forthright.\nGore had been grasped by one of the main thrusts of Romans, and was\ndetermined that his readers be grasped by it as well. Whenever he comes\nnear the subject of the grace of God freely given to sinners in Jesus Christ\nand him cruci\u00aeed; whenever he can say something about God being not a\nhard taskmaster but a loving father; whenever Paul suggests to him the\nquestion of whether we save ourselves by our moral efforts or whether all\nour moral effort is but a feeble response to God's sovereign love \u00b1 then the\nstaunch Anglo-Catholic catches \u00aere, his prose becomes elevated, and he\npreaches the gospel of God's love and grace as well as any Protestant or\nevangelical. He names, shames and demolishes the characteristically English\n393\nComing home to St Paul? Reading Romans a hundred years after Charles Gore\n2 Charles Gore, St Paul's Epistle to the Romans: A Practical Exposition, 2 vols (London: John\nMurray, 1899, 1900), 1.v. Subsequent non-annotated references are to this work.\nPelagianism,3 along with all attempts to rely on past traditions, including\nevangelical and Catholic, instead of scripture. He is aware of much nominal\nChristianity, and knows that Paul will have none of it. His own personal\ndevotion to Jesus Christ, and single-minded determination to serve him,\nshines through page after page.\nEarly in the commentary, and repeatedly throughout it, he raises the\nquestion: is the Paul of Martin Luther the real Paul? Last week a learned\nItalian theologian accused Martin Luther of being the patron saint of the\nfast-food hamburger;4 we should be wary of attributing all our be\u00c3tes noires to\nthe German reformer. We must distinguish Luther himself from Lutheran\ntradition, and later low-grade caricatures. But was Paul, Gore asks, really\nadvocating a standard Protestant individualism?5 He is anxious to be fair to\nLuther, and to explain why his protest was necessary in its day. But he is still\nmore anxious to wean his hearers off any assumption that what they know\nas Protestantism will do justice to the depth of Paul's thought. `St. Paul', he\nwrites, `has for us undercut and antiquated the theological standing-\ngrounds of the sixteenth century, and substituted for them something both\ntruer, completer, and freer.'6\nGore's question anticipated by nearly 80 years one of the greatest shifts\nin Pauline studies to have occurred since critical scholarship began. In 1977\nEd P. Sanders published his Paul and Palestinian Judaism, whose aim was to rebut\nwhat had become a 400-year-long tradition, especially associated with\nLutheran theology and exegesis, of how to understand the Judaism to\nwhich Paul was reacting and hence of how to expound Paul himself.7\nDespite some weaknesses, I regard Sanders's central thesis as secure: the\nJudaism of Paul's day was not a kind of primitive version of Pelagianism, of\na self-help morality which seeks to justify itself by the unaided performance\nof moral good works. Judaism bases itself upon the grace of God which\nestablished the covenant with Abraham and brought Israel out of Egypt.\nObservance of Torah \u00afows from gratitude. Sanders did not succeed in\nworking out a new way of reading Paul to match this insight; that task\nremains un\u00aenished among scholars today. But the old Protestant picture of\nPaul opposing self-help moralism or ritualism, the doing of good works to\n394\nscottish journal of theology\n3 E.g. 1.8f.\n4 Professor Massimo Salari declared that the hamburger `re\u00afects the individualistic\nrelationship between man and God established by Luther', according to The Independent\n(Friday 10 Nov 2000), p. 18.\n5 Cf. esp. 1.32\u00b141.\n6 1.40f.\n7 E. P. Sanders, Paul and Palestinian Judaism: A Comparison of Patterns of Religion (London: SCM,\n1977).\nearn God's favour, with the gospel of grace and faith simply will not stand\nup historically. To this we shall return. Gore had on his side the very\nstructure of Romans itself, and some of its inner logic.\nIt has become notorious in the century since he wrote that one of the\nhardest things to do with Romans is to explain the relationship between its\ndifferent sections. How do chapters 9\u00b111 relate to the rest? And how do\nchapters 1\u00b14 belong with 5\u00b18? What is the connection between justi-\n\u00aecation in chapters 3 and 4 and baptism in chapter 6? When, 12 years after\nGore's commentary, Albert Schweitzer published his book Paul and His\nInterpreters, he elevated the difference between these two sections of Romans\ninto his central organising principle, making them represent two different\ntypes of theology which Paul had brought together, only one of which\nrepresented the heart of his thought. Schweitzer called these two types the\n`juridical', represented by the law-court language in chapters 3 and 4, and\nthe `mystical', represented by the `being-in-Christ' thought of chapters\n6\u00b18.8 But for Gore no such split was necessary. One does not have to play\noff justi\u00aecation against incorporation into Christ; theologically one can, and\nGore does, hold them together \u00b1 as indeed of course Paul himself does\nelsewhere, for instance in Gal 3:21\u00b14:7.\nGore answers his own question by insisting that though one is justi\u00aeed\nby faith alone, the faith that justi\u00aees is never in fact alone. It goes with a\nlively incorporation into the body of Christ, and with all that is meant by\nbaptism, through which one comes to live the communal and sacramental\nlife. Gore emphasises that each Christian must make this real for him- or\nherself; there are no passengers on this boat; but individualism is out of the\nquestion. Justi\u00aecation is, says Gore, all about `membership in the sacred\npeople, the Israel of God'.9\nGore's exposition of what we may call the ecclesiological dimension of\nPaul's thinking issues in a robust exposition of Rom 12\u00b115. Rom 12, he\npoints out, is not simply a set of individual ethics but the description of\nwhat it takes to live together as a community \u00b1 something which Gore had\nhimself been endeavouring to do, in Pusey House, in Radley, then in\nWestminster, and which was to bear remarkable fruit in the newly formed\nCommunity of the Resurrection. His treatment of chapters 13, 14 and 15\nbears the same stamp. Precisely because he holds together justi\u00aecation and\nthe life of the church, these chapters do not fall off the back of the\n395\nComing home to St Paul? Reading Romans a hundred years after Charles Gore\n8 A. Schweitzer, Paul and His Interpreters: A Critical History (London: Black, 1912 [1st German\nedn also 1912]). Schweitzer's later study, The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle (London: Black,\n1931) expounds this fully.\n9 1.35.\ncommentary as they do so often. However, in my view he fails to follow\nthrough his own insights about the roots of Paul's ecclesiology within the\nJewish covenant theology of the OT and of the \u00aerst century.10\nIn particular, he falls back \u00b1 as, given his theology, he scarcely needed to\ndo \u00b1 on the view that chapters 9\u00b111 are an `episode', a discussion without\nwhich the letter would still \u00afow perfectly well. Explaining that he had\noriginally been put off these chapters because of their Calvinist misuse, he\noffers a careful though not very deep exposition of what they are actually\nabout, namely, the plight of unbelieving Israel. What he never sees \u00b1 but\nwould have been helpful to his whole theme \u00b1 is the organic connection of\nchapters 9\u00b111 to all that had gone before, especially chapters 3 and 4. He\nsees that the church needs warning against anti-semitism \u00b1 he is aware of\nwriting immediately after the affaire Dreyfus \u00b1 but he can still declare that the\ntwin climaxes of the letter are chapters 3 and 8, not, as it would seem to\nmost today, chapters 8 and 11.11\nThus Gore, though he uses the idea of the church as the community of\nthe renewed covenant as a principal means of tying together individual faith\nand the life of the church, points beyond what he achieves exegetically. The\nsame is true in the other emphasis which his followers would not be\nsurprised to see: a strong note of social protest against oppressive systems\nand structures. As with the warmth of his personal devotion, one senses that\nhe had only to get a whiff of social justice in a text before he was on to it,\ncalling (for instance) for a new sense not just of sin but of social sin.12 And,\nthough he does not develop the connection very far, this belongs closely\nwith his splendid exposition of the groaning of creation and its promised\nrenewal (8:18\u00b125). He not only sees the Jewish roots of Paul's thought at\nthis point, and his close awareness of the pain at the heart of creation itself;\nhe sees that here Paul stands over against all false and one-sided spiritualism\nand materialism. `The religion of the Incarnation,' he writes, `as represented\nby St. Paul, recognizes [the material world] as God's creation and the\ntemple of His presence.'13 For Gore that phrase, `the religion of the\nIncarnation', said it all. That was, for him, the heart of Christology and\n396\nscottish journal of theology\n10 Thus, for instance, he goes back to a standard exposition of the place of Abraham in\nRom 4, and the treatment of the Jewish Law in ch. 7 \u00b1 though he sees, for instance,\nthat nomos in 7:21 must mean `the Jewish Law', not some abstract `principle' (1.269f.),\na point most commentators still miss.\n11 On the present situation of the Jews in France and England: 2.92; on the climaxes of\nthe letter: 1.271.\n12 1.257f., with a note lamenting how little notice had been taken of a Lambeth resolution\non industrial problems.\n13 1.307f.\nhence the heart of the revelation of God, and it inspired alike his Pauline\nvision of the eventual renewal, as opposed to the abandonment, of all\ncreation, and his lifelong passion for social justice, at a time when such a\ntheme was far less common than it is today.\nBut once again, at least in his commentary, he did not tie the two\ntogether. Here too I believe we can point beyond where he got to, and offer\na reading of Romans which, from an unexpected angle, gives fuller\ngrounding to the his concerns.\nThe Paul, then, to whom Charles Gore came home was a man of\npassionate devotional allegiance, theological conviction, ecclesial commit-\nment, sacri\u00aecial holiness, and social concern. What I now wish to propose\nis that exactly this Paul was in fact more present in the very text Gore was\nexpounding than he himself had seen, and that when we offer a more\ntightly knit and historically grounded exegesis we \u00aend that these themes,\nfar from being left behind, are more securely based and suggestively\nworked out. I turn, then, \u00aerst to Paul's exposition of the new covenant in\nChrist, and second to his exposition of the challenge to paganism in general\nand, perhaps to our surprise, to Caesar in particular.\n3. Paul and the new covenant\nWhen we come home to Paul, the man we discover is a \u00aerst-century Jew.\nFor the last half-century most scholars have seen Paul as a Jewish thinker,\nrather than one who swapped Jewish categories for Gentile or Hellenistic\nones. We stand on the shoulders of W. D. Davies's 1948 book Paul and\nRabbinic Judaism,14 which took the elements of Paul that had been used in the\nHellenistic hypothesis and showed that they were better explained by\nseeing Paul as a rabbi who believed the Messiah had come. Signi\u00aecantly,\nthis was just when theologians were becoming aware, after the Holocaust,\nof the dangers of treating Judaism as the wrong sort of religion. Since then\nmost of the `Pauls' offered by scholarship have been Jewish, though, as\nwith Jesus, the further question, what sort of Jew, remains controversial.\nThe so-called `new perspective on Paul', launched by Ed Sanders in the\nmid-1970s, has developed this further. But neither Davies, nor Sanders, nor\ntheir followers, have advanced a satisfactory new picture of Paul as a whole\n\u00b1 religion, theology, exegesis, and contemporary application. I want to\nsuggest a reading of Paul and Romans, building on the work of Davies and\nSanders while modifying some of their proposals, through which we can\ndo more fully what Gore was trying to do, namely, hold together the warm\n397\nComing home to St Paul? Reading Romans a hundred years after Charles Gore\n14 W. D. Davies, Paul and Rabbinic Judaism: Some Rabbinic Elements in Pauline Theology, 4th edn\n(Philadelphia: Fortress, 1980 [1948]).\npersonal faith by which one is justi\u00aeed and membership in the church, the\ncovenant people promised by God to Abraham. This will lead on to the two\nother concerns, the moral and the social.15\nFour interlocking points form the foundation. The \u00aerst is Paul's under-\nstanding of the purpose of God's covenant. In line with much Jewish\nthinking, he believed that God's covenant with Israel was itself designed to\nput the world to rights, to bring justice to the entire cosmos. Israel is the\nlight of the world, carrying God's commission to bring that light to the\npagans. Part of Paul's critique of Israel is precisely that they have turned this\ncommission into a mere privilege. In Gore's stringent language about\nChristian leaders, they wanted to shine rather than to serve.16\nThe second is that when Paul says `Christ' he regularly intends us to\nhear, not a proper name merely, but the title `Messiah', meaning by that not\nleast `the one in whom Israel's identity is bound up'. The Messiah represents\nIsrael, so that what is true of him is true of them, and vice versa. The\nMessiah's death and resurrection are therefore the means whereby, and the\nsign that, Israel according to the \u00afesh has passed under judgment, and the\nnew covenant has been constituted whereby all who belong to the Messiah\n\u00b1 Jew and Gentile alike \u00b1 are part of God's people. Jesus' messianic death\nand resurrection are his faithful obedience to the covenant purposes of God;\nthrough him, God has now accomplished what he always purposed. Put\ntogether the \u00aerst two points: because of the meaning of the covenant, God's\nachievement in Christ cannot be restricted to the salvation of individual\nsouls, but must reach out to the bringing of God's eventual justice to the\ncosmos.\nThe third point is the meaning of `the righteousness of God' \u00b1 one of the\nkey phrases in Romans. This righteousness, in line with the Jewish back-\nground, is not the status that God gives, imputes or imparts to faithful\nhumans; nor is it a moral principle or energy which God places within us. It\nis God's own faithfulness to the covenant. Jews of Paul's day wrestled with\nthe question, how can God be faithful to the covenant, granted all that has\nhappened? What will this covenant faithfulness look like when it is \u00aenally\nunveiled?17 Paul's answer, decisive for the shaping and theology of\nRomans, is that God's righteousness, his covenant faithfulness, has been\nunveiled once for all in Jesus the Messiah, and in the gospel announcement\nof his death and resurrection.\n398\nscottish journal of theology\n15 On all that follows, see now my commentary on Romans in New Interpreter's Bible\nvol. 10 (Nashville: Abingdon, 2002).\n16 2.112.\n17 See particularly 4 Ezra.\nThe fourth point is that the exodus story forms the narrative substructure\nof much of Paul's writing. The exodus was the great redeeming action,\naccomplished in ful\u00aelment of God's covenant promises to Abraham. Paul\nnow uses exodus language to explain the signi\u00aecance of the Messiah's death\nand resurrection. He shapes the whole of Rom 4\u00b18 around a long retelling\nof the story: the promise to Abraham in chapter 4, the passage through the\nbaptismal water by which freedom is attained in chapter 6, the giving of\nthe Spirit to do what the law could not in chapters 7 and 8, \u00aenally reaching\nthe inheritance, the whole redeemed creation, at the climax of chapter 8.\nThe Paul of Romans is thus a deeply Jewish thinker, rethinking his\nJewish categories around his belief that the cruci\u00aeed and risen Jesus is\nIsrael's representative Messiah. Within this scheme of thought, the key focal\npoints stand out. Jesus' obedient death is the central covenant action,\nrevealing God's love and grace in decisive and climactic action, dealing with\nsin by condemning it in his \u00afesh (8:3). Justi\u00aecation by faith is the juridical\ndeclaration in the present time which anticipates the verdict of the last day:\nfaith that Jesus is Lord, and that God raised him from the dead,18 is the\nresult of the Spirit's work through the gospel \u00b1 and what God has thus\nbegun, he will certainly complete.19 Justi\u00aecation is not merely law court\nlanguage, however; if it were, it would be isolated from the life of the\nchurch and from Christian morality. Justi\u00aecation is also covenant language, as\nin Rom 4 (a sustained exposition of Gen 15, where God establishes his\ncovenant with Abraham), and has to do precisely with God's setting up of\nthe single family, consisting of Jews and Gentiles together, characterised by\nfaith rather than by possession or keeping of Torah. It is a measure of Gore's\ninsight that he glimpsed some of this at least, even though he did not follow\nit through.20\nRom 9\u00b111 is not, then, an extraneous aside, but a necessary and intrinsic\npart of the letter. It addresses questions Paul cannot avoid, which he has\nindeed noted earlier.21 It is also, arguably, the \u00aerst point of immediate\nrelevance he wants to get across to the predominantly Gentile Christians in\nRome. He wants them to see how God's righteousness, God's covenant\nfaithfulness, works out in practice; he tells the entire covenant story in Rom\n9 and 10, from Abraham right through to the Messiah and, beyond, to the\nGentile mission whereby they themselves have come to faith. But that same\ncovenant faithfulness means that unbelieving Jews will always remain\n399\nComing home to St Paul? Reading Romans a hundred years after Charles Gore\n18 A primitive `creed' in 10:9, as Gore rightly saw (2.55).\n19 Phil 1:6.\n20 1.20: `Justi\u00aecation by faith is opposed to justi\u00aecation by works of the law, as the\nuniversal or catholic to the merely Jewish or national.'\n21 In 3:1\u00b19.\nwithin the scope of God's love. God has not cut them off for ever, and if\nGentile Christians suppose he has, they are making the same mistake of\nethnic superiority that Paul had made in his pre-Christian days and now saw\nin many of his fellow Jews.\nIn the same way, chapters 12\u00b115 focus on the question of how Christ-\nians from different cultural backgrounds should live together in a single\ncommunity \u00b1 a question of particular relevance to Rome, where groups\nfrom different backgrounds often lived separately, as in some modern\ncities. This reaches its climax in an often-ignored passage, 15:1\u00b113, the\n\u00aenal theological and practical paragraph before the lengthy closing material.\nThe main purpose of the letter is not, after all, simply to tell Rome that all\nhave sinned and can be justi\u00aeed by faith through the death of the Messiah;\nit expounds those truths, as the centre of the unveiling of God's right-\neousness, in order to build on them these great arguments about the\nmission and unity of the church.\nWhen, therefore, we come home to Paul as a \u00aerst-century Jewish\ncovenant theologian, expounding his belief that in Jesus Christ the faithful-\nness of God has burst unexpectedly upon Israel and the world, we discover\na way of doing more securely what Gore was determined to do in holding\ntogether justi\u00aecation by faith and membership in the church.The larger\nstory of Israel within which Paul lives, which I have labelled with the word\n`covenant', enables both of these to be held with equal force and appro-\npriate correlation. As Gore himself exempli\u00aeed, warm personal faith and\nstrong membership in Christ's body belong together.\n4. Paul, paganism and Caesar\nThis brings us to the other two areas in which Charles Gore was eager to\nexplore Paul's thought, but was not able to substantiate his hunches. First,\nhow does Paul integrate justi\u00aecation by faith with his strong moral teach-\ning? Second, what does Paul have to say on what we loosely call `social\njustice'?\nAt the heart of Paul we \u00aend his opposition, not to Judaism, but to\npaganism. Precisely because he remains a deeply Jewish thinker, believing\nthat the God of Abraham is the one true God, now revealed in Jesus the\nMessiah, he stands \u00aermly and Jewishly opposed to paganism of every sort.\nOn the cross, the true God has defeated the false gods, and this victory must\nnow be worked out in Christian lives and Christian communities.\nPaul, then, did not derive his ideas from paganism. There are parallels,\ncross-over points of theme and language. But Paul intends to confront the\nworld of paganism \u00b1 with the news that the God of Abraham is its rightful\nGod, the Jewish Messiah its rightful Lord, and that those who give\n400\nscottish journal of theology\nallegiance to this God and Lord are the true heirs of the world, the truly\nhuman people. As in the Areopagus speech, Paul declares to the pagan\nworld that what it has been groping after all along is now revealed by the\ntrue God in the gospel of Jesus.\nThe basic challenge of Paul's gospel is not, therefore, against self-help\nmoralism \u00b1 though if Paul had ever met proto-Pelagians, which is unlikely,\nhe would have put them straight. There were pagan moralists, and Paul has\nwords for them too, but his main challenge is against idolatry and the\ndehumanisation that results from it. Humans are made in God's image, to\nre\u00afect his glory; those who worship that which is not God \u00aend that their\nimage-bearing capability, their glorious humanness, begins to unravel.\nThose, however, who worship the true God (this is what Paul means by\n`the obedience of faith') will rediscover their genuine humanness. All\nsinned, and lost God's glory; those whom God justi\u00aeed, them he also\nglori\u00aeed. If Rom 3 and 4 are about justi\u00aecation, Rom 5\u00b18 are not so much\nabout sancti\u00aecation as glori\u00aecation, with sancti\u00aecation as a sub-category.22\nChristian holiness, for Paul, means becoming more truly human. And the\nfaith that justi\u00aees, itself the gift of God by the Spirit and the response to\nGod's grace in the gospel, is also the core of that worship in which\nhumanity is renewed.\nWatch how this works in the four main sections of Romans. In the \u00aerst\nfour chapters, Paul demonstrates that, through the death and resurrection of\nthe Messiah, God has established the community he promised to Abraham,\nthe single family of Jews and Gentiles together, characterised by faith in the\ngospel. At the close of chapter 4 he describes Abraham's faith: it was his\nbelief in God's promise to give him and Sarah a son in their old age. Paul\nhere deliberately contrasts this faith with the faithlessness described in Rom\n1:18\u00b132, where idolatry in the pagan world results in the fracturing of the\nglory, the image-bearing, that was humanity's vocation.23 This naturally\nleads on to Rom 5, in which Christ is seen as the true Adam, the source of\ngenuine humanity, generating by the Spirit a renewed human life of\nholiness and hope. In the climax of Rom 8, Paul sees the whole creation,\nnot as itself divine \u00b1 that's the mistake of paganism \u00b1 but as God's good\ncreation which is designed to be \u00afooded with God, renewed by the Spirit,\nto experience its own exodus when the children of God are themselves\nraised from the dead. That which paganism has wrongly worshipped will\none day share the freedom of the glory of God's children. Paganism is, after\n401\nComing home to St Paul? Reading Romans a hundred years after Charles Gore\n22 Cf. 3:23; 8:29\u00b130, with e.g. 6:19, 22.\n23 Cp. esp. 4:18\u00b125 with 1:18\u00b125.\nall, a parody of the truth, wanting to steal the beautiful empty chalice\ninstead of waiting for it to be \u00aelled with the wine of God's love.24\nThen, in 9\u00b111 and 12\u00b116, Paul challenges the Roman church not to\nbehave as pagan society around is behaving. Roman anti-Judaism is well\nknown in classical literature. The church had been largely Gentile after the\nexpulsion of the Jews from Rome in the late 40s, and now had to face the\nquestion of its attitude to the large number of recently returned non-\nChristian Jews, and also its attitude to Jewish Christians. His appeal in both\ncases is that the church should learn to live as God's true humanity, in\naccordance with his covenant faithfulness and the call to unity in Christ. The\nmain thrusts of the letter, therefore, can be seen all through to \u00afow from\nPaul's essentially Jewish understanding, rethought in Christ, and to tell\nagainst paganism in general, and any attempt on the part of Christians to go\nwith its \u00afow. All of this continues to tie together the emphasis on\njusti\u00aecation by faith with that on Christian holiness, without confusion or\nmuddle. If faith is genuine, the attachment to God in Christ that it expresses\ncannot but issue in a searching and serious holiness of life. Gore's exposi-\ntion of Rom 6:1\u00b111 and 12:1\u00b12 makes it clear both that the huge moral\ndemands made by the gospel are simply a response to grace, being in no\nway an attempt to place God in human debt, and that the demands are\nindeed total.25\nWithin this, however, one particular emphasis is emerging in very\nrecent study, and it provides the other missing link which joins Pauline\ntheology closely with the vocation to social critique and to work for God's\njustice in the world \u00b1 the very thing Charles Gore was eager to do. Romans,\nI suggest, indicates that Paul intended his gospel to subvert not merely\npaganism in general but the imperial cult in particular.\nThe imperial cult \u00b1 worship of the emperor, and of Rome \u00b1 was the\nfastest-growing religion in Paul's world. The early emperors drew back\nfrom claiming actual divine honours for themselves in Rome and Italy\nduring their lifetime. But there was no such restraint further east. In any\ncase, being styled `son of god', following the apotheosis of the previous\nemperor, was almost as good \u00b1 especially when, from Augustus onwards,\nemperors were able to claim that their dynasty had brought peace and\njustice to the warring world. New temples to Caesar and Rome were\nspringing up; some city centres were redesigned to give them maximum\nprominence. Paul could not have missed it. Nor could he have dismissed\n402\nscottish journal of theology\n24 On this, see e.g. my The Crown and the Fire (London: SPCK, 1992), ch. 10.\n25 1.204\u00b125; 2.97\u00b1102.\nit as of merely political rather than religious importance; he would not have\nmade that distinction. Whereas almost all works on Paul assume that Rom\n13:1\u00b17 is his only comment on Caesar, this is far from the truth.\nRecent studies of Philippians have shown that Paul was capable of\naddressing this issue sharply and subversively. The Christ-poem in Phil\n2:5\u00b111, though its sources and theology are Jewish, parodies some aspects\nof the Caesar-cult; when Paul says Jesus is Lord, he means that Caesar is not.\nThe end of Phil 3, likewise, refers to Jesus as Saviour, Lord and King in a\nway which certainly intends a contrast with Caesar. Similar hints are found\nin 1 Thessalonians and elsewhere.\nBut it is in Romans itself, written to Christians right under Caesar's nose,\nthat the subversive theme emerges most strikingly. Caesar claimed to be\n`son of god'; his accession day, or birthday, was hailed as `good news',\neuaggelion; he was regarded as the Lord of the world, the one to whom all\nnations owed allegiance. Through his powerful rule justice and salvation\nhad come to the world: Roman `justice', Iustitia, \u00aerst became a goddess\nunder Augustus. With all that in mind, think through the famous \u00aerst\nparagraph of Romans (1:1\u00b117), which by common consent introduces the\nthemes of the whole letter, and watch it come up in three dimensions. Paul\nintroduces himself as the apostle of God, commissioned to announce the\ngospel of God's son, who was now the rightful lord of the whole world and\nwho claimed obedience and loyalty from all. Through this gospel, God was\npowerfully at work to produce salvation, because in the gospel God's\nrighteousness, his justice, had been unveiled. That is why, says Paul, he is\nnot ashamed to be coming to preach in Rome. The gospel of Christ, by\nstrong implication, upstages the gospel of Caesar.\nThe same point is stressed at the end. In the \u00aenal climax, urging\nChristians of different backgrounds to unite in worship of the one true\nLord, Paul quotes from the royal prophecy of Isa 11. The root of Jesse shall\nappear, the one who rises to rule the nations; in him shall the nations hope.\nPaul's hearers knew that there was already a king who ruled the nations.\nThe opening and theological closing of Romans declare that Caesar is a\nparody of the true lordship of Jesus.\nOnce we understand how the theme of God's justice unveiled in the\ngospel actually works, the rest of the letter will fall into place. The renewal\nof all creation in Rom 8 can be seen as the climax it really is, instead of\nbeing sidelined as in so many individualised readings of Romans. Caesar's\nattempt to bring the world into new peace and harmony are to be upstaged\nby God's great act of liberation. Caesar, of course, ruled the world by sheer\nforce, with cruci\u00aexion both as his primary weapon and as a regular symbol\nof his authority. Paul's theology of the cross, as the secret means whereby\n403\nComing home to St Paul? Reading Romans a hundred years after Charles Gore\nGod has defeated the powers of the world,26 comes into its own in a new\nway, standing on its head this symbol of imperial arrogance and making it\ninstead the symbol of all-powerful divine love.27 Romans as a whole, by\nexpounding God's creation of the single family of faith in which Jew and\nGentile come together in one body, provides the charter for what we must\ncall a counter-empire: a worldwide, multi-ethnic family owing allegiance\nto Jesus as Lord rather than Caesar, and looking forward to inheriting the\nrenewed creation.\nWithin this framework, Rom 13:1\u00b17 can be seen for what it is. It is a\nJewish-style statement that rulers are not divine, but owe allegiance to the\none God. When this is realised, the rulers are to be obeyed, because God\ndesires that evil should be checked, that anarchy should be resisted, that\nlaws should be enacted through which societies can live in order and peace.\nPaul inherited the tradition of, among other things, Jeremiah, in which the\nIsraelites are instructed to pray for the welfare of Babylon as long as they are\nliving there, and of Daniel, in which, though the rulers of the world are\nregularly warned, judged, condemned and demoted, Daniel and his compa-\nnions are promoted to high ranks of service within the imperial household.\nGod desires order, it seems, not chaos; when rulers discover they are not\ndivine, they can once more be God's agents, whether knowingly or not, to\npromote good order in the world.\nPaul did not suggest to the Romans, a tiny and fragmented church in a\nhuge pagan capital, that they should begin to campaign for better laws and\nmore effective justice. He might as well have told them what sort of\naeroplanes they should be building for the next stage of his mission. But,\njust as elsewhere he laid the foundation for revolutions yet to come, so in\nhis subversive, almost cheeky, upstaging of Caesar's claims with those of\nJesus, I believe he laid the foundations for a fully integrated and theo-\nlogically coherent Christian social agenda which we today ignore at our\nperil. Just as justi\u00aecation by faith and the life of the church are held together\nwith Paul's wider covenant theology, and just as grace, faith and moral\neffort belong together, so the whole theology of salvation and the responsi-\nbilty to promote God's justice in the world are held together, within that\nsame covenant theology, by Paul's high Christology and by his grand vision\nof the eventual renewal of all creation, the bringing of God's healing justice\nto bear on the cosmos as a whole. Once again, in learning to see in Paul\nthings that Charles Gore never dreamed of, we are nevertheless meeting a\n\u00aegure to whom he would have been happy to come home.\n404\nscottish journal of theology\n26 See 1 Cor 2:6\u00b18; Col. 2:13\u00b115.\n27 E.g. Rom 8:31\u00b139.\n5. The end of our exploring\nTime permits only the briefest of conclusions. I allow myself three points\nonly, corresponding to the three main points I have made.\nFirst, when we locate Paul's theology of justi\u00aecation within his larger\ncovenant theology, we see that it is not simply a controversial doctrine that\nwe might now be able to agree on, but is the doctrine which itself commits\nus to ecclesial membership and hence ecumenical endeavour. Justi\u00aecation\nmeans not simply that God accepts us by grace through faith; it means that\nall who believe in Jesus Christ belong together in one worshipping family,\nsharing at the same table. When we integrate Rom 3 and 4 with the\nincorporative theology of Rom 5\u00b18 and the practical instructions of Rom\n14 and 15, we discover that this ecumenical work is never a matter of one\nside giving the orders to the others, but of all working together, preferring\nthe way of tolerance of things indifferent to an insistence on solving all\nproblems before we can unite in shared worship. Paul has so often been a\nsign of division, but when we come home to him he offers us ways to\ngrown into real union.\nSecond, the integration of Paul's ethics with his theology, such as Gore\nglimpsed in Romans and we have developed further, suggests that main-\nstream Western churches need to look hard at some of today's familiar\nassumptions. Justi\u00aecation means, at one level, that God accepts us as we are.\nBut God's acceptance is always the transforming acceptance of holy love,\ndemanding from us not a slack acquiescence in whatever state we happen to\nbe in, but serious and Spirit-helped moral effort in becoming what God\nintends for us. Without this, we slip back into the worst of both worlds,\nholding the form of a bare and caricatured Protestant justi\u00aecation-theology\nbut without any of the lively devotion that has traditionally accompanied it.\nAn integrated Pauline ethic never says, `Because God has accepted me, I can\nstay as I am'. It always says that the mercy of God invites me to present my\nbody as a living sacri\u00aece, holy and acceptable. It never asks, `What am I\nallowed to do? Can I get away with this?' It always asks, `How can I live\naccording to the Spirit, not according to the \u00afesh? How can I be trans-\nformed by the renewing of my mind, rather than being conformed to the\npresent age?'\nThird, the social and political implications of reading Romans against the\nbackground of the Caesar-cult need to be teased out in more detail. As with\nmany aspects of post-Enlightenment thought, we have tended to assume\nthat there are really only two possible positions, the quiescent and the\nrevolutionary. Most have assumed that Rom 13 means that Paul was\npolitically quiescent; you might suppose that my new proposed reading\nmeans he was straightforwardly revolutionary. As with the Enlightenment\n405\nComing home to St Paul? Reading Romans a hundred years after Charles Gore\nsplits between sacred and secular, and between individual and community,\nthis is far too simplistic. Paul stands in the tradition of apocalyptic and\ncovenantal Judaism that includes Isaiah, Jeremiah and Daniel: earthly\npowers must learn that they are not divine, but once that lesson is learned\nthey have a positive place and purpose in God's will for the world.\nThe church has found it dif\u00aecult to maintain this balance. From the\nsecond-century apologists, who both appealed to rulers and suffered\nmartyrdom, through the Constantinian settlement, through the many\ndifferent models of church\/state relationship essayed in the Middle Ages,\nthe Reformation and thereafter, in this country and elsewhere, the church\nhas struggled to hold together its double responsibility: to live by the gospel\nof Jesus which proclaims him as the world's true Lord, and to live as good\ncitizens of a state which may or may not acknowledge that Lordship. Here\nat Westminster that balance is symbolically maintained by our crowning of\nmonarchs right in front of the text from Revelation, written in gold above\nthe high altar: `The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of\nour Lord, and of his Christ.'28 Confrontation and collaboration are both\nappropriate expressions of this responsibility; it may result in martyrdom,\nas with Bonhoeffer, or it may result in partnership, as with (to think of our\nroots) Aidan and Oswald. Here again this abbey symbolises both, with its\nroyal tombs and its martyrs' memorials.\nWhat this responsibility rules out, I think, are Erastianism at one end and\ndualist disengagement at the other. Few today want the former; but the\nclamour for disengagement is loud, particularly in the press. Some argue for\ndisengagement on Christian grounds; but what is really driving the agenda\nis the secularist desire that the church should mind its spiritual business and\nleave the state to look after society and politics \u00b1 in other words, that the\nchurch should not even think of saying that Jesus is Lord and Caesar isn't.\nBut Pauline Christianity is not about discovering a way of being religious or\nspiritual, or a private route to salvation. It is about announcing, and living\nby, the message that Jesus is Lord of all. To retreat into the private world of\nour own religious life is not a way of keeping ourselves pure from the non-\nChristian world; it is, ironically, a way of compromising with the world,\ngiving in to its sacred\/secular split.\nWe must of course look hard at how our present Establishment correlates\nwith our ecumenical collaboration, and indeed our relation to quite\ndifferent worldviews. But to disengage because such questions exist is to\nscrap the car because the steering needs adjusting. If Daniel had not been at\nBelshazzar's court, no-one would have been able to read the writing on the\n406\nscottish journal of theology\n28 Rev 11:15 (`kingdom' is singular in the original).\nwall. Precisely at this time of massive worldview confusion in the country\nand the wider world, we need all the engagement we can get if we are to\nplay the same prophetic role, announcing the gospel of Jesus and living by\nit within Caesar's world.\nWho then is Caesar in a modern liberal democracy, a tradition which is\nitself profoundly though ambiguously in\u00afuenced by Christianity? That is a\nharder question. Caesar does not live in either Buckingham Palace or\nDowning Street, nor yet in the Stock Exchange or Fleet Street \u00b1 though each\npossesses some Caesar-like attributes. But there are powers in our world\nthat want to become Caesar, and the church of Jesus Christ is one of the\nmain obstacles in their way. As readers of Paul we will be unwilling to stand\naside and give them a free run: not because we seek political power for\nourselves, but because we believe that if, in the old pietist phrase, Jesus\nChrist is not Lord of all he is not Lord at all.\nThe call to social justice in the present, in the light of God's promised\nrecreation of the whole cosmos, stands in parallel to the call to Christian\nholiness. Christians are called to live in the present in the light of God's\nfuture; it won't do to say God will make us holy hereafter, we must make it\nreal right now. Similarly, it won't do to say that God will one day solve the\nproblems and there's nothing we can do in the meantime. Precisely because\nGod will one day put the whole world to rights by the Spirit, we Christians,\nindwelt by that same Spirit, should go to work today, as Charles Gore did,\nto inaugurate as far as possible that world-renewing justice which will do\nwhat Caesar's justice claims to do but cannot.\nA fresh reading of Romans, then, grateful to Charles Gore but deter-\nmined to press on beyond, can invigorate Christian discipleship and\nmission like little else. The end of our exploring is to come home to the\nPaul from whom we started, and know him for the \u00aerst time. As we do so,\nwe may \u00aend fresh ways towards an integrated and challenging Christian\nworldview: to fold again the tongues of \u00afame into the crowned knot of \u00aere,\nso that the \u00aere and the rose may be one.\n407\nComing home to St Paul?
