Shadlen \n \n \nIntellectual property (IP) policies influence trajectories of industrial development and \ncapacities to address humanitarian concerns. As pillars of national systems of innovation, \nIP regimes drive technological change through their effect on knowledge-creation and \nknowledge-diffusion. By affecting access to technologically intensive goods, such as \npharmaceuticals, IP regimes influence national public health programs. This article \nbridges these dimensions. Analysis of the politics of drug patents in Brazil and Mexico \nshows that how IP affects the industrial sector, particularly the pharmaceutical industry, \nestablishes the political-economic parameters affecting countries\u2019 abilities to use IP to \npromote public health. \nPrior to the 1990s neither Brazil nor Mexico (nor many other developing countries) \ngranted patents on pharmaceuticals.1 Local firms could produce generic versions of new \ndrugs that typically were patented in the OECD.2 In the 1990s both countries introduced \npharmaceutical patents to comply with new international obligations. The World Trade \nOrganization\u2019s (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property \nRights (TRIPS) and the IP provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement \n(NAFTA) prohibit countries from declaring pharmaceuticals nonpatentable; and the \nagreements require countries to provide patent holders with strong rights of exclusion over \nthe knowledge contained in the patent. Providing market exclusivity to owners of drugs \ncan raise prices, place drugs out of consumers\u2019 reach, and strain governments\u2019 health \nbudgets.3 Not surprisingly, the introduction of drug patents was followed by backlash, and \nby the late 1990s policymakers in many developing countries faced pressures to modify \ntheir new IP systems. \nPolicy in Brazil and Mexico took different courses in response to this changing \nscenario. Brazil adjusted the IP system to ameliorate the effects that drug patents can have \non prices and access; Mexico introduced few adjustments, and where changes were \nintroduced they tended to reinforce and intensify the effects of drug patents. Variation in \nIP policy can be considered along three dimensions: what knowledge can be owned as \nproperty, the rights of owners versus users of property, and the effective duration of \nproperty owners\u2019 rights. In Brazil obtaining private ownership over knowledge in the \nrealm of pharmaceuticals has become more difficult, and the rights of third parties to use \nknowledge simplified. In Mexico impediments have been raised to third parties\u2019 rights to \nuse knowledge, and the effective length of protection extended. \nOne seemingly obvious explanation for these differences is that Mexico is in \nNAFTA, while Brazil has no external obligations beyond its membership in the WTO. \nAlthough NAFTA places greater restrictions on IP policy, reliance on NAFTA as an \nexplanatory factor is inadequate. Differences in the two countries\u2019 international legal \nobligations cannot explain the divergence. If it were the case that the reforms introduced \nby Brazil would, were they transferred to Mexico, violate NAFTA, then NAFTA could \npartially account for the divergence; it could tell us that Mexico could not take the same \npath as Brazil on account of its \u201cWTO-Plus\u201d commitments. But the reforms introduced by \nBrazil would not violate NAFTA; legally, Mexico could imitate Brazil. Moreover, a strict \nemphasis on NAFTA cannot explain why Mexico reformed its IP system by moving in the \nopposite direction as Brazil. Mexico did not simply fail to emulate Brazil\u2019s IP move from \naway from \u201cTRIPS-Plus\u201d but rather moved to an extended version of TRIPS-Plus. \nNor can the outcome be explained by focusing on political bias.4 To be sure, the \nBrazilian governments in the period under study (Cardoso, 1994\u20132002; Lula, 2002 to the \npresent) were more left-leaning than their Mexican counterparts (Zedillo, 1994\u20132000; Fox \n2000\u20132006), which perhaps might lead us to expect Brazil to prioritize health. Yet the \nmajor health-oriented reforms occurred under President Cardoso, the more centrist of the \ntwo Brazilian presidents. This is the same Cardoso that championed the original TRIPS-\nPlus patent law in 1996, and the subsequent policy shift is not linked to prior changes in \nideological disposition or political bias. In Mexico the right-leaning Fox government \nintroduced progressive reforms to the health system to make access to health care a citizen-\nbased rather than employment-based right.5 \nA political economy explanation for Brazil and Mexico\u2019s divergent trajectories of \npatent policy focuses on the actors pushing for reform and patterns of coalitional \nformation and political mobilization. In both countries, drug patents and high prices \nyielded initiatives for health-oriented IP reform. What varies is who led these initiatives \nand the extent to which important actors in local pharmaceutical sectors were available as \ncoalition partners. In Brazil the existence of an economically and politically more \nautonomous local pharmaceutical sector allowed the Ministry of Health to build a \ncoalition in support of IP reform. In Mexico fundamental transformations of the \npharmaceutical sector yielded a different terrain. In fact, the reform project in Mexico \nbecame commandeered by IP owners and ultimately had the perverse effect of reinforcing \nthe system that was challenged. \nOf course, the transformation of Mexico\u2019s pharmaceutical sector is not unrelated to \nNAFTA, which introduced substantial tariff reduction and revisions to government \nprocurement practices that previously afforded special treatment to local firms. These \nbroad shifts in policy, including pharmaceutical patent protection, induced changes to \nMexico\u2019s industrial sector that would ultimately restrict the realm of feasible policy \nalternatives. NAFTA is indeed significant, then, but in a broad political economy sense. A \nlesson of this article for scholars of international and comparative political economy is that \nwe need to reorient our attention from the legal to the political economy aspects of \ninternational agreements\u2014that is, not the rules per se but how such agreements unleash \neconomic and social changes that in turn affect policy choices. \nThis article also presents lessons for analysts relying on models of policy diffusion.6 \nDiffusion models depict policymaking as an interdependent and interactive process, in \nwhich the likelihood that a given policy will be adopted in one country is a function of its \nadoption (or nonadoption) in other countries. Some analysts apply this logic to the case of \nIP and drugs. Nunn et al. suggest that Brazilian officials learned from Thailand\u2019s example \nof using IP regulations to challenge transnational pharmaceutical firms\u2019 pricing practices.7 \nCohen and Lybecker suggest that the Brazilian example of health-oriented IP reform can \nlead other countries to act similarly, citing Mexico as a country so inspired by Brazil.8  \nIndeed, learning from members of countries\u2019 \u201cpeer groups\u201d is a principal mechanism of \ndiffusion in this literature. \nAlthough the idea of reforming the IP system for public health purposes diffused from \nBrazil to Mexico, the policy did not. The legislative initiative proposed to modify \nMexico\u2019s patent system made explicit reference to the Brazilian experience that was to be \nreplicated. But once the diffused idea placed IP on the political agenda in Mexico, the \ninitiative became commandeered by those who wanted Mexico\u2019s patent rules to be made \nmore useful for patent-holding firms to strengthen their property rights and ward off \ncompetition than for the government to negotiate price reductions. The product of \ndiffusion was not Mexico adopting policies that worked in Brazil, but rather policies that \nwere the mirror image of those in Brazil. The explanation for this difference is in the \nidentity of the actors receiving and attempting to implement the diffused idea of health- \noriented IP, and the availability of powerful alliance partners for those actors advocating \nreform. This article thus provides a caution against overstating the significance of ideas \nand policy communities, and calls for renewed attention to traditional variables such as \ninterests and resources. \n \n \nPatents, Pharmaceuticals, and Health Policy \n \nPrior to explaining the different policy trajectories experienced by Brazil and Mexico in \nhealth-related dimensions of IP, it is important to understand the range of variation. In this \nsection a framework is provided that allows us to conceptualize variation with regard to \npatents, pharmaceuticals, and health policy.9 \nPatents confer limited rights of exclusion over inventions that are novel and non- \nobvious and have industrial utility. Although granting a patent turns knowledge into \nprivate property, the rights of owners over their property are limited in that they are not \nautomatic, not absolute, and not permanent. Patents are granted only where applicants \ndemonstrate that their inventions satisfy the criteria of patentability. With application and \nexamination central and prior to the process of establishing ownership, governments can \ncontrol what knowledge becomes private property within their territory. Because the \nestablishment of ownership follows and depends on the examination of patent \napplications, governments can control what knowledge becomes private property within \ntheir territory. Another limitation is that patent rights include various exceptions to patent \nholders\u2019 ability to control the use and distribution of their property. Patent regimes include \nprovisions by which third parties can, without requesting permission, use knowledge that \nis owned by someone else. They also include provisions that allow third parties to receive \npermission from the state to use other actors\u2019 privately owned knowledge in ways that \nwould otherwise constitute violations of patent holders\u2019 rights. Lastly, patents expire. At \nsome point the private property enters the public domain, where access to and use of the \nknowledge is unrestricted. \nThese three limitations map onto lines of political conflict over what can be owned \nprivately, between the rights of owners and users of private property, and over the duration \nof rights. These lines of conflict, in turn, map roughly onto axes of policy variation10. The \nrows in Table 1 take us from a limitation to a political conflict and then provide health-\nrelated policy examples. \n \n \nTable 1 Law, Politics, and Health Policy \n \nLimitations Political Conflict Health-Related Policy Areas \nNot automatic What can be owned Pharmaceutical patents \n\u201cPipeline patents\u201d \nNot Absolute Rights of owners vs. users Compulsory licenses \nParallel imports \nNot Permanent Duration of rights Post-patent generic entry (early \nworking provisions, drug \nregistration procedures) \n \nWith regard to conflicts over what sort of knowledge can be owned privately, the \nmost important policy issue is whether or not countries grant pharmaceutical patents. As \nindicated, many developing countries did not do so prior to the 1990s, but TRIPS (and \nNAFTA) requires that countries grant patents on pharmaceutical products and processes.11 \nA second policy issue is how to deal with inventions that are not new but that were \nnot patented when they were new because the previous regime did not allow the sort of \nknowledge to be patented. If a country began granting pharmaceutical patents in 1995, for \nexample, a drug invented in 1990 would not have been eligible for a patent when it was \nnew. The novelty requirement would also make the drug unpatentable in 1995, even with \nthe introduction of pharmaceutical patents, because it was no longer new. Since drugs are \npatented before marketing authority is secured, the 1990 drug would most likely be \nundergoing clinical trials in 1995\u2014it would be in the \u201cpipeline.\u201d How do countries \nintroducing pharmaceutical patents treat drugs in the pipeline? On this dimension NAFTA \nexceeds TRIPS by obligating countries to offer \u201cpipeline patents.\u201d12 \nPolicy areas that correspond to conflicts over the rights of owners versus users \nconcern compulsory licenses (CLs) and parallel imports. CLs allow domestic entities \n(public or private) to import, produce, and distribute patented goods without the patent \nholders\u2019 consent. TRIPS and NAFTA allow countries to determine the grounds on which \nthey grant CLs, provided that a set of procedural conditions (such as prior negotiations \nwith the patent holder and payment of royalties).13 In the case of CLs granted during times \nof national emergency or for government use, countries are released from the obligation of \nprior negotiations.14 Because potential delays introduced by negotiations are removed with \nthis latter type of CL, these CLs are easier and quicker to grant and, arguably, most \nrelevant for discussions of health. \nParallel importation consists of allowing patented goods to enter the market once \npatent holders have placed the goods on the market elsewhere. Parallel imports can help \nensure affordability of patented products by facilitating arbitrage and thus constraining \npatent holders\u2019 ability to set monopoly prices. TRIPS allows countries to engage in parallel \nimportation by adopting international doctrines of patent exhaustion; that is, once products \nare placed on the international market, patent holders\u2019 exclusive rights are exhausted. \nNAFTA prohibits parallel importation by requiring national doctrines of patent exhaustion. \nHealth-related policy areas corresponding to conflicts over the length of rights regard \npost-patent generic entry. When patents expire and knowledge enters the public domain, \nnew actors gain rights to participate in markets that were reserved for patent holders. How \nquickly new actors enter markets and the subsequent competitive effects are felt in terms \nof reduced prices depends on a number of important policies, particularly early working \nprovisions and procedures for registering generic drugs. Early working provisions allow \nfirms to use patented knowledge and produce generic versions of patented drugs to obtain \nmarketing approval once patents expire.15 Without such provisions firms might be \ninfringing patents by producing generic versions prior to the patents\u2019 expiration. Yet if \nfirms must wait until patents expire to produce generic versions and apply to health \nauthorities for authorization, patent terms are effectively extended by the amount of time it \ntakes to complete these not-insignificant steps. Early working provisions, then, by \nallowing generic firms to use patented knowledge to prepare for market entry, can expedite \ncompetition at the point that patents expire. TRIPS and NAFTA both permit early working \nprovisions.16 \nSome pharmaceutical firms opt to launch generic versions prior to the end of patent \nterms, believing that their follow-on products do not infringe existing patents or that the \npatents in question are invalid. Since marketing drugs depends on authorization from \nhealth authorities, the subsequent question is whether and how the activities of IP and \nhealth officials are coordinated. Neither TRIPS nor NAFTA addresses this. More recently, \nthe United States has pushed strongly for a form of coordination known as \u201clinkage,\u201d \nwhereby health authorities consult with IP authorities and deny registration to drugs when \npatents are in force. While this form of coordination seems unproblematic on the face of it \n(if the drug is patented, then the sale of generic versions would be illegal), many \ndeveloping countries resist pressures to proceed in this direction, arguing that linkage \ninappropriately transfers the burden of defending patents from the private rights-holder to \nthe public. In any case, this form of linkage, though included in more recent regional and \nbilateral trade agreements (RBTAs) negotiated with the United States, is not in NAFTA. \nTable 2 contrasts the WTO and NAFTA with regard to the health-policy dimensions \nof the two agreements\u2019 IP provisions. While it is clear that there are differences, such as \npipeline patents and parallel imports, the similarities are certainly greater. \n \n \nTable 2 IP and Health Policy: WTO vs. NAFTA \n \nPolicy Issue WTO (TRIPS) NAFTA (Chapter 17) \nPharmaceutical patents Required (product and process) \u2013 \nPipeline patents Not required Required \nCompulsory licenses Permitted; ample discretion \u2013 \nParallel imports Permitted Not permitted \nEarly working provisions Permitted \u2013 \nDrug registration procedures Not addressed \u2013 \nNote: \u2013 indicates that NAFTA and TRIPS are identical \n \n \nThe WTO\u2019s and NAFTA\u2019s provisions indicate the parameters of what countries can \nand cannot do, but not what they actually do. Table 3 presents the main characteristics of the \nBrazilian and Mexican patent regimes implemented in the 1990s. Both countries greatly \nexceeded their new obligations, making ownership easy to obtain over a wide variety of \npharmaceutical and pharmochemical products and processes, and giving owners strong and \neffectively long rights of exclusion. From a public health perspective, both countries\u2019 patent \nregimes were worrisome. For example, both countries offered pipeline patents, neither allowed \nparallel imports, both had only rudimentary mechanisms for compulsory licenses to deal with \nhealth concerns, and neither had early working provisions. As a result of these \u201cTRIPS Plus\u201d \npatent regimes, more drugs would become patented in both countries and it would be difficult \nto rely on generic competition to reduce prices. Beginning in the late 1990s, however, the \ntwo countries diverge in dramatic fashion. The subsequent sections explain this \ndivergence, drawing our attention to the important role of local pharmaceutical industries \nin coalitions for health-oriented patent reform. \n \n \nTable 3 Health-Related IP Policy: Common Origins \n \nPolicy Brazil Mexico \nPharmaceutical patents Yes (1997) Yes (1991) \n\u201cPipeline patents\u201d Yes (1996) Yes (1991) \nCompulsory licenses Yes (basic, Art. 77) Yes (basic, Art. 71) \nParallel imports No No \nEarly working provisions No No \nLinkage No No \nNote: The shaded text indicates important differences. \nBrazil: From TRIPS  Plus to \u201cTRIPS  Just\u201d \n \nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, health-related aspects of Brazil\u2019s patent regime under- went \nsubstantial modifications. Obtaining pharmaceutical patents was made more difficult, the patent \nlaw was modified to facilitate government efforts to lower prices through compulsory licensing, \nand the government enacted measures to encourage competition with generics. The nature of \nthe Brazilian government\u2019s demand for patented and expensive drugs made health-\noriented IP reform a high priority, and the political organization and structure of the \nBrazilian pharmaceutical industry made reform politically feasible. \nThe Brazilian government\u2019s demand for drugs was strong and relatively inelastic to \nprice on account of the Ministry of Health\u2019s (MH) extensive obligations to provide free \nmedicines. These obligations are rooted in the 1988 Constitution, which establishes the \nright to health, including access to essential medicines through the new national health \ncare system (SUS) as a universal right. Government demand was particularly shaped by \nthe HIV\/AIDS epidemic. Although Brazil\u2019s adult prevalence rate of 0.6 percent is not \nparticularly high by international standards, the country stands out for its early (since \nthe late 1980s) and comprehensive approach toward prevention and treatment. \nImportantly, a 1996 Law guaranteed free antiretroviral (ARV) treatment through the \nMH\u2019s National HIV\/AIDS Program, and intense social mobilization further \nreinforced the government\u2019s obligations.17 \nBrazil\u2019s approach to HIV\/AIDS treatment affected the government\u2019s demand in \nsuch a way as to make IP reform an imperative. Because ARVs treat but do not cure \nHIV\/AIDS, they need to be taken indefinitely; and patients need to change treatment \nregimens as immunities develop. By the late 1990s the annual per patient cost of \ntreatment in Brazil was nearly US$5,000 and ARVs already consumed one-third of \nthe MH\u2019s drug budget, and this was at a time when treatment featured almost \nexclusively unpatented drugs. As more people began treatment and as patients \nmigrated to expensive second-line regimens based on drugs that were patented under \nBrazil\u2019s new IP law, the program would be unsustainable.18 \nSince 1999, then, the government took a range of measures to improve the capacity \nof the National HIV\/AIDS Program (and the SUS more generally) to acquire less ex- \npensive, generic versions of newer drugs from both foreign and local suppliers. The MH\u2019s \ninitiative to lower costs via promotion of generics led to three important modifications of \nBrazil\u2019s new IP system: health authorities gained prominence in reviewing patent \napplications, compulsory licensing provisions were made more flexible and easier to \nuse, and regulatory reforms were introduced to expedite post-patent generic entry. \nAny pharmaceutical patent application that is approved by the National Institute for \nIndustrial Property (INPI) is sent to the MH for review. The patent is issued only after IP \nofficials in the Ministry\u2019s health surveillance agency (ANVISA) issue \u201cprior consent.\u201d19 \nThis reform, introduced by decree by President Cardoso in 1999 and converted into law \nin 2001, aimed to provide the MH with an instrument to influence the patent \nexamination process, influence that it would otherwise lack on account of INPI being \nsituated within a different ministry. \nThe prior consent requirement makes it more difficult to obtain private rights of \nexclusion over knowledge for pharmaceuticals. Many patent applications are not for \nnew molecular entities (NMEs) but rather revised versions of NMEs that are already \npatented, raising the question of how patent examiners define \u201cnovelty.\u201d20 ANVISA\u2019s \nhealth-focused examination is significantly stricter than INPI\u2019s.21 Whereas INPI is \ncriticized by health activists and lawyers for adopting an overly broad definition of \nnovelty, ANVISA denies patents to drugs that lack \u201cgenuine\u201d novelty and where it \nadjudges that providing exclusive rights would be harmful to public health. Typically \nANVISA uses its authority to prevent patents that, by its judgment, would extend the \nterms of existing patents.22 As Table 4 indicates, 53 applications approved by INPI have \nbeen rejected by ANVISA since the prior consent process was initiated in 2001. Perhaps \nmore critically, of the 68.9 percent of the applications that ANVISA has approved, in \n42 percent of these cases the applicant first had to reduce the breadth of the patent\u2019s \nclaims.23 \n \n \nTable 4 ANVISA\u2019s Prior Consent (through July 2008) \n \nDecision Number of Cases Percentage \nApprovals 752 68.9 \nDenials 53 4.9 \nPending (as of July 2008) 122 11.2 \nOther* 165 15.1 \nTotal 1092 100.0 \n*Includes applications returned to INPI for further documentation and because determined \nnot to be pharmaceutical patent applications \nSource: ANVISA \n \n \nNo aspect of the global politics of IP has received so much attention as compulsory \nlicenses, and Brazil has been at the forefront of these debates. The 1996 LPI includes \nmultiple articles that address CLs, the most significant for our purposes being Article 71 \ncovering national emergencies and situations of \u201cpublic interest.\u201d Presidential directives \nin 1999 and 2003 reformed Article 71 to make it more useful and thus increase the \nMH\u2019s capacity to leverage price reductions from patent-holding pharmaceutical firms.24 \nThese revisions gave clearer definitions of national emergency and public interest and \nsimplified the mechanism for issuing CLs by giving the MH greater authority to act. \nImportantly, the 2003 directive stipulates that private firms supplying the government \nconstitutes \u201cpublic use\u201d and is thus acceptable under Article 71, and also requires patent \nowners to transfer technological knowledge in the case of CLs.25 \nThe threat of a CL is a bargaining tool used to entice patent holders to make their \nproducts available at lower prices. The effectiveness of the bargaining tool, however, depends \non the credibility of the threat. The reforms to Article 71 make the Brazilian government\u2019s \nthreats more credible by making CLs easier to issue and less vulnerable to appeal, and by \nincreasing the government\u2019s ability to secure the relevant drugs from alternative \nsuppliers. \nSince 2001 the MH has repeatedly used the CL instruments to obtain price reductions on \nsecond-line ARVs that consume a disproportionate share of the MH\u2019s drug budget. The key \nARVs (patent holders) are efavirenz (Merck), lopinavir\/ritonavir (Abbott), and Nelfinavir \n(Roche), which account for roughly 60 percent of the government\u2019s ARV expenditures. In \nAugust 2001, for example, the MH announced it would issue a compulsory license on \nnelfinavir, and Roche responded by reducing the price. Similar episodes occurred with \nRoche and Abbott, with Merck in 2003, and then again with Abbott in 2005. In \n2007, following protracted negotiations with Merck, Brazil issued a CL on efavirenz. \nNote that these drugs are patented in Brazil because of the inclusion of pipeline patents in \nthe 1996 LPI. Thus, to an important extent, the reforms to, and exercise of, the CL \nprovisions can be understood as efforts to ameliorate the effects of the TRIPS Plus LPI. \nNegotiations have not always been entirely successful. The 2005 agreement with Abbott \nleft the price of lopinavir\/ritonavir well above Abbott\u2019s most discounted international price, for \nexample, and the MH is widely criticized for not issuing more CLs.26 Yet the MH\u2019s \nstrategy, its shortcomings notwithstanding, has resulted in significant cost savings, even as \npatented second-line treatments play increasingly greater roles in the national treatment \nprogram.27 In fact, while the affordability of second-line ARVs provided the main impetus for \nIP reform, the modifications have yielded lower drug prices across the board.28 \nThe Brazilian strategy to introduce generic competition also included amending the \n1996 LPI to introduce an early working provision, which allows generic firms to prepare \nfor market entry at the moment of patent expiration.29 Importantly, Brazilian authorities \nrefuse to adjust terms for patents granted under the pipeline mechanism. That is, if a \npatent had a priority date from its application in the United States of January 31, 1987, \nfor example, and was granted in Brazil under the pipeline mechanism in 1999, the \npatent would be due to expire in both the United States and Brazil on the same day, \nJanuary 30, 2007. And even if the United States were to extend the expiry date by \ntwo years, until January 2009, it would still expire in 2007 in Brazil. The transnational \nsector pushes strongly for adjusting patent terms in this way and regularly demands this in \ncourt, but doing so is not the norm in Brazil.30  The bias against adjustments of patent terms \nprovides generic producers with incentives to utilize the early working provision. The \neffectiveness of the system is further enhanced by ANVISA\u2019s policy of granting rapid approval \nof products that satisfy health criteria, leaving questions of potential patent infringement to \nbe contested in courts. \nWhile the nature of demand has driven the Brazilian government to introduce \nthese health-oriented IP reforms, the support of the Brazilian pharmaceutical sector \nmakes doing so feasible. The reforms, not surprisingly, have drawn strong criticism \nfrom the transnational pharmaceutical sector from both its representatives in Brazil \n(INTERFARMA) and the United States (PhRMA). Actors that once heaped praise on \nBrazil for its \u201cmodern\u201d 1996 LPI now complain of piracy and theft.31 But these attacks do \nnot isolate the government, which can rest on the support of a coalition of actors representing \nthe national pharmochemical (ABIFINA) and pharmaceutical (ALANAC, ALFOB, and \nProGen\u00e9ricos) producers. These organizations\u2014some of which unsuccessfully resisted the \n1996 LPI\u2014act as a bulwark against INTERFARMA, consistently presenting positions \ncontrary to those of the transnational sector. When INTERFARMA assailed the reforms \nintroduced in 1999 and 2000 or the 2007 CL, for example, ABIFINA quickly came to \nthe MH\u2019s defense.32 \nThe existence of a coalition supportive of health-oriented IP reforms is partially a \nfunction of state policy. After all, the local pharmaceutical sector benefited from \nsignificant government investment in research and production, much of it through the \nMH itself.33 The Ministry, acting as \u201chealth entrepreneur,\u201d does not just purchase \ndrugs but also takes an active role in their production.34 Public sector labs are important \nsuppliers to the government, and, earlier in the production chain, the state works with \nprivate firms to help them develop synthesis technologies, produce necessary \nintermediates, and acquire capacities for reverse-engineering active principal \ningredients (APIs). \nEconomic and technological collaboration between the public and private sectors \ncreated conditions for a political alliance and hospitable ground for the government\u2019s \nhealth-oriented IP reforms. The transnational sector opposed the government at nearly \nevery step, but INTERFARMA does not monopolize the sector politically. The \nexistence of a national pharmaceutical sector with interests distinct from the \ntransnationals and with productive capacity retained from an earlier period of \nindustrialization presented the MH with friendly and cooperative interlocutors. Indeed, \nthe 2003 presidential directive on CLs was drafted by a lawyer who works as an advisor \nto ABIFINA.35 \nIt is essential to emphasize that the virtuous circle, whereby the government invests \nin industry and industry supports the government\u2019s IP reforms, is possible because of \nthe condition of the local pharmaceutical sector. Even with the introduction of \npharmaceutical patents and in the context of trade liberalization and an overvalued \ncurrency, Brazilian firms retained market share in the 1990s. By the time health-related \nIP reforms became politically salient, local firms still accounted for roughly one-quarter \nof sales and dominated the nascent generics market, and pharmochemical firms \nretained twice the market share of Chinese and Indian combined imports.36 A critical \npoint here is the remaining capacity to produce final drugs and APIs, which is a legacy \nof the importsubstituting period, particularly the push for backward integration of the \npharmaceutical sector in the 1980s.37 Furthermore, the \u201clate\u201d introduction of \npharmaceutical patents in 1997 meant that the potential denationalizing effects had not \nyet materialized.38 Because Brazilian firms were still capable of benefiting from the \ngovernment\u2019s strategy, they were available alliance partners. \n \n \nMexico: From  TRIPS  Plus to NAFTA Plus \n \nPolicy in Mexico followed a fundamentally different trajectory. Whereas Brazil \nimplemented reforms to ameliorate the effects of patents on drug prices, Mexico\u2019s \npolicies reinforce these effects. Changes to Mexico\u2019s patent law make use more difficult \nand complicate the process by which CLs can be issued, and modest steps to encourage \npost-patent generic competition were introduced in a self-undermining fashion. The \nexplanation for this different path is rooted in the Mexican government\u2019s less \ncomprehensive response to the HIV\/AIDS epidemic, which made IP reforms less \ncompelling, and in the transformations of the pharmaceutical sector, which not only \nmade coalition-building for health-oriented IP reform less feasible but facilitated a \ncountermobilization on the part of patent owners. \nAlthough the affordability of medicines became a prominent issue in Mexico in the \nlate 1990s, as prices increased significantly above the rate of inflation in the years \nfollowing the 1994 devaluation of the peso, the nature of government demand reduced \nthe sensitivity to such changes. State provision of discounted and free medicines was \nfar from universal, extending only to workers in the formal sector (IMSS) and \ngovernment employees (ISSSTE). Nor did Mexico\u2019s Secretariat of Health (SH) face \nBrazilian-like obligations with regard to ARVs. Most HIV\/AIDS treatment was \nprovided outside of the state system and the uninsured generally lacked access.39 Thus, \nthe SH had less cause for alarm in the face of higher prices and less motive to reform \nthe patent system. \nRather than coming from within government, the initiative for health-oriented \npatent reform came from a segment of the local pharmaceutical sector that emerged in \nthe 1990s in response to economic crisis and the limited coverage of IMSS\/ISSSTE. In \nthe late 1990s and early 2000s a chain of pharmacies selling nonbioequivalent generics \nunder the mark Similares (Similars) expanded in low-income areas throughout the \ncountry.40 The emergence of Farmacias Similares gave local firms that had traditionally \nsupplied the state sector opportunities to sell to private pharmacies. The actors in the \nchain were closely related, in fact, with the leading producer of nonbioequivalent \ngenerics (Laboratorios Best) owned by the same person who owned the Farmacias \nSimilares chain, a physician-pharmacist-industrialist named Victor Gonz\u00e1lez Torres, \nalso known as \u201cDr. Simi.\u201d41 \nThe Similares sector and its allies in Congress spearheaded the initiative to reform \nthe patent system. In December 2002 Dr. Simi\u2019s nephew, a Green Party (PVEM) \nmember of the Chamber of Deputies, presented an initiative that would reform the 1991 \nLPI by reducing patent terms to ten years in the case of serious health situations. The \nPVEM initiative would have violated Mexico\u2019s TRIPS and NAFTA requirements for \ntwenty-year patent terms, but instead of rejecting the proposal out of hand, the Science \nand Technology Commission (CCyT) modified it. For all the proposal\u2019s faults, its \nmotivations and context were not to be ignored. Escalating drug prices were making \naccess to medicines a growing problem, and as the initiative\u2019s authors emphasized, \nother developing countries (such as Brazil) were demonstrating the feasibility of \nhealth-oriented patent reforms. Thus, the president of the CCyT acknowledged the \nconcerns expressed by the bill\u2019s sponsors and decided to rewrite the proposal with \nproper legal assistance.42 \nWhile the original proposal addressed patent terms (Article 23), the revised bill \naddressed CLs (Article 77), an area where Mexico had discretion under TRIPS and \nNAFTA. In March 2003 the CCyT approved a modest reform that would increase the \ncapacity of the SH to issue CLs in the case of health emergencies. The key elements \nwere to make a state of \u201cserious illness\u201d declared by the SH a ground for CLs, to \nsimplify the process by which serious illness is declared, and to assure rapid issue of \nCLs at low royalties. \nThe March 2003 bill, similar in many ways to Brazil\u2019s 1999 CL reform, drew a \nsharp reaction from the transnational pharmaceutical industry and its local \nrepresentatives. Government officials and legislators found themselves besieged by \nletters, faxes, e-mails, phone calls, and personal visits from the transnational sector\u2019s \ntrade association (AMIIF), Mexico\u2019s leading law firms, the USTR, and foreign \nembassies (for example, of the United States and Switzerland). \nThe transnational sector did not just react defensively but went on the offensive, \nconverting the threat into an opportunity. AMIIF had attempted to terminate the patent \nreform project, though once it was kept alive by the CCyT, AMIIF and its allies \nmobilized to secure a reform that would make the granting of CLs less likely than \nunder the 1991 law.43 The campaign was successful, as the transnational sector \nessentially commandeered the initiative. The Fox government, never compelled by IP \nreform in the first place, joined the counteroffensive. The Secretary of Government\u2019s \nlegislative liaison insisted that the March 2003 version could not proceed and \nprovided the CCyT with a revised text.44 This new version, which was passed by the \nfull Chamber of Deputies and Senate and then signed into law by President Fox in \n2004, increases the obstacles to issuing compulsory licenses by making the process by \nwhich serious illness declared more complicated, removing serious illness as a ground \nfor a CL, and requiring high minimum royalty rates.45 \nThe transnational sector also secured favorable changes with regard to post-patent \ngeneric entry. In September 2003, at the same time as the reform to the patent law was \nin the Senate, the Fox government announced a new linkage system that requires \nhealth authorities to consult with the IP office and deny marketing authority to drugs \nwhere patents remain in effect. Thus, while Brazil\u2019s prior consent measure integrates \nhealth criteria into patent policy, Mexico\u2019s linkage system subordinates health policy to \npatent criteria. \nMexico also introduced an early working provision at this time, but this is largely \nundermined by the transnational sector\u2019s ability to secure routine adjustment of the \nexpiration dates on pipeline patents.46 The Mexican IP law stipulates that pipeline \npatents expire in Mexico on the same date as they expire in the first country where the \npatent was filed. These clauses, though contested in courts, essentially commit Mexico \nto adjust expiry dates. Because patent terms are adjusted in Mexico when they are \nadjusted in the original country, industry actors cannot know when a drug\u2019s patent \nwill expire, which makes it difficult to take advantage of any opportunities created \nby the early working provision. \nThe changes introduced to Mexico\u2019s IP system (and health regulatory structure \nmore generally) mean that the prices of patented drugs remain higher in Mexico. \nPatent-holding pharmaceutical firms do not fear CLs, and thus feel little compulsion to \nreduce prices. Abbott, for example, prices its patented version of lopinavir\/ritonavir \nat more than five times the Brazilian price, but the Mexican government lacks the \ninstruments to negotiate price reductions. More accurately, such instruments, as they \npreviously existed, were dulled by the reforms of 2003\u201304. \nTo make sense of the perverse experience of IP reform in Mexico, where an \ninitiative to enhance the rights of knowledge-users ended up yielding a set of changes \nthat strengthen the rights of knowledge-owners, it helps to consider the changing \npolitical economy of the pharmaceutical sector. In contrast to Brazil, where \nINTERFARMA\u2019s positions are regularly countered by rival actors, in Mexico AMIIF \ndominates the sector economically and politically. Of course, individual Mexican firms \nwould benefit from Brazilian-style patent reforms, as originally approved by the CCyT, \nyet outside of Farmacias Similares (and its subsidiary firms and suppliers) not even the \nlocal pharmaceutical sector provided support for the favorable version of the CCyT\u2019s \ninitiative or opposed the revised and unfavorable version. Nor did they much contest the \nlinkage system. \nThe early and, with the inclusion of pipeline patents, retroactive introduction of \npharmaceutical patents transformed Mexico\u2019s pharmaceutical sector. Through the \nmid\u20131980s the national pharmaceutical sector thrived on reverse-engineering \nunpatented drugs.47 By the late 1990s, however, trade liberalization had undermined \nthe pharmochemical sector and patent protection transformed the industrial structure. \nThe decline of local firms in Mexico was much more accentuated than in Brazil. \nMexican firms account for less than 15 percent of sales. In fact, nearly two-thirds of \nMexico\u2019s pharmochemical firms disappeared from 1987 to 1998 as the sector became \nsubject to import competition and patent protection.48 \nThe transformation in industrial structure is reflected in the realm of politics. \nWhereas AMIIF and the principal association representing local firms (CANIFARMA) \nwere arch-enemies during the IP debates of the 1980s and early 1990s, by the early \n2000s they were speaking with one voice. Indeed, the organizations were formally \nfused, with the president of CANIFARMA an invited member of AMIIF\u2019s board and \nthe CANIFARMA\u2019s two-year presidency alternating between Mexican and foreign \nfirms. Nor does Mexico have an equivalent to Brazil\u2019s ABIFINA. Instead, the \npharmochemical sector\u2019s representative body consists of a small unit within a broader \nmultisectoral industrial chamber of manufacturing industries (CANACINTRA), \nwhich itself experienced dramatic decay in this period.49  In short, Mexico\u2019s \npharmaceutical and pharmochemical producers could not articulate positions \nindependent from the transnational sector\u2019s because the local sector was neither \neconomically nor politically independent. \nA potential source of support for the CCyT\u2019s initiative was from the segment of \nindustry that focuses on bioequivalent generics, represented by the National \nPharmaceutical Association (ANAFAM). Yet this organization found itself in stark \ndecline in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with a shrinking membership. In fact, \nANAFAM did not represent a national pharmaceutical sector either, for this segment \nwas undergoing trans-nationalization of its own, with international generic firms \npurchasing long-established Mexican firms.50 ANAFAM\u2019s strategizing in response to \nthe CCyT initiative reflects this politically precarious position. ANAFAM advised \nCANIFARMA that, despite the likelihood that members of the two organizations \nwould benefit from the proposed reform, they should lay low and refrain from \nshowing support to avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest.51 Fighting on two \nfronts\u2014against AMIIF and Similares\u2014and politically unstable on account of its \nown transnationalization, the bioequivalent generics sector was in no position to lend \nits support to the CL initiative, nor to oppose the revised pro-AMIIF version. \nCANIFARMA and ANAFAM\u2019s economic and political weakness meant that \nAMIIF came to dictate the positions of the pharmaceutical industry on matters of policy. \nThe lone alternative voice came from the Similares sector\u2014purveyors of \nnonbioequivalent medicines (which most countries, including Mexico, are eliminating \nfrom the market) and closely tied to the fringe PVEM. AMIIF, thus, was able to do \nbetter than prevent Mexico\u2019s patent law from being reformed\u2014a la Brazil\u2014to \nsimplify CLs. The transnational sector engineered reforms to Article 77 and the health \nregulatory system that strengthen the rights of knowledge-owners. \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn this article a framework is introduced for comparing countries\u2019 patent systems, and \nBrazil and Mexico\u2019s distinct trajectories of patent policy since the late 1990s are \nexplained. On each of three dimensions\u2014what knowledge can be owned as property, \nthe rights of owners versus users of property, and the effective duration of property \nowners\u2019 rights\u2014the Brazilian tendency has been to increase the capacities of \nknowledge-users while the Mexican tendency has been to reinforce the rights of \nknowledge-owners.52 \nThis article brings politics to bear on a topic that has been dominated by analyses \nof laws and formal international agreements. Comparing Brazil and Mexico, for \nexample, focusing on external legal obligations calls attention to NAFTA, which \nincludes IP provisions that differ from TRIPS (Table 2). Yet this is an insufficient \nexplanation. As of the late 1990s the health dimensions of the two countries\u2019 patent \nsystems were similar, and the subsequent divergence did not conform to unique \nobligations that Mexico had under NAFTA.53 All the reforms implemented in Brazil \nwould be acceptable under NAFTA too. \nThe divergence is attributable to distinct interests and alliances over IP policy. In \nBrazil the nature of government demand for patented and expensive drugs made \nhealth-oriented IP reform a high priority, and the political and economic \ncharacteristics of the pharmaceutical sector facilitated the creation of a coalition for \nIP reform. In Mexico, however, a less comprehensive response to the HIV\/AIDS \nepidemic made IP reforms less compelling, and a transformed pharmaceutical \nsector not only prevented coalition-building for health-oriented IP reform but \nfacilitated a countermobilization that strengthened the rights of patent owners. The \nargument is not that local pharmaceutical sectors drove policy change, but that \ntheir economic and political characteristics affected the receptiveness to such policy \ninitiatives. The Brazilian reforms were state-led, but they were feasible because the \ngovernment could elicit the support of local actors that had retained valuable \neconomic and political assets. Different legacies of industrialization combined with \nBrazil\u2019s comparatively later retiring of industrial policies and introduction of \npharmaceutical patents meant that Brazil was less advanced along the \npharmaceutical-denationalization curve than Mexico. \nTo the extent that the argument rests on the actions of Brazilian and Mexican health \nofficials, it is not a matter of institutional structure but power vis-\u00e0-vis society. Brazil\u2019s IP \nreforms were spearheaded by Health Minister Jos\u00e9 Serra, a close ally of the President \nwho would run for the presidency in 2002, and Brazil\u2019s health activism certainly needs to \nbe understood in this larger political-electoral context. Yet Mexico\u2019s Health Secretary \nJulio Frenk was a prominent figure within President Fox\u2019s cabinet as well. Mexico moved \ntoward universalizing health coverage under Frenk\u2019s tutelage, a measure that reflects the \nSecretary\u2019s authority. Yet state power is situational and relational, depending on what \nsocietal allies are available and against what opponents. The nature of Mexico\u2019s \ntransnationalized pharmaceutical sector meant that Frenk could not, and therefore would \nnot, attempt to go down the Brazilian path. \nTo understand the importance of industrial structure, consider a counterfactual\u2014the \nMexican government was not motivated to pursue health-oriented IP reform, but suppose \nthat it were so inclined. It is difficult to imagine how the SH could have created the sort of \npro-reform coalition as Brazil\u2019s MH did, because the early introduction of pharmaceutical \npatents and the subsequent transformation of the sector deprived it of potential allies. \nIndeed, on a number of issues related to health provision, Mexico\u2019s SH sought the \ncollaboration of local producers only to be stymied by AMIIF\u2019s dominance of the sector \nand the absence of local interlocutors. Industrial transformation and denationalization have \npolitical as well as policy consequences. \nEmphasizing industrial structure aims to supplement (not substitute) prevailing \nemphases on Brazilian civil society\u2019s role in pushing government to make AIDS treatment \na high priority and introduce health-oriented IP reforms. Whatever inspired the Brazilian \ngovernment to act, local industry was crucial in not blocking, and indeed eventually \nsupporting, the reforms. The difference with Mexico, where domestic industry ended up \nactively opposing health-oriented IP reforms and effectively supporting a strengthening of \npatent holders\u2019 rights hand-in-hand with the transnational sector, is stark. \nTo conclude, it is worth returning to the two areas where IP matters: technology and \nindustrialization, and health and humanitarianism. The analysis bridges these two realms, \nfor the key variable explaining differences between Brazil and Mexico has been the \nexistence of indigenous pharmaceutical and pharmochemical capacities. An earlier \ngeneration of scholarship argued that promotion of local pharmaceutical sectors may be \nimportant for industrial development, but that because promotional measures may also \nraise the final prices of medicines, such strategies were less beneficial on the humanitarian \naxis of development.54 The argument and findings in this article invert this line of \nreasoning: to use IP to achieve humanitarian goals, countries also need to use IP to achieve \nindustrial goals. They need local pharmaceutical industries that can act as a countervailing \npolitical force to the transnational sector. Indeed, whereas previous scholarship has \ndepicted pharmaceutical development as good for industrialization but not for \nhumanitarianism, this article shows how pharmaceutical development may be good for \nboth, because it makes humanitarianism politically feasible in the world of strong IP. The \nkey to reforming patent systems to increase access to drugs is the presence of \neconomically and politically autonomous, national pharmaceutical industries as coalition \npartners for those advocating such reforms. \n \n \n \nNOTES \n \nThe British Academy and Nuffield Foundation financed the research for this article.

In fact, some policy areas are relevant to multiple lines of conflict. \n11. Countries that did not grant pharmaceutical patents prior to 1995 had until 2005 to begin doing so. \n12. In addition to stretching the definition of \u201cnovelty,\u201d the problem with pipeline patents is that that they \nare not examined but rather revalidated. \n13. Compare the nearly identical CL provisions of TRIPS Article 31 (http:\/\/www.wto.org\/english\/tratop_e\/\ntrips_e\/t_agm3c_e.htm#5) and NAFTA Article 1709.10 (http:\/\/www.sice.oas.org\/Trade\/nafta\/chap-171.asp).\n14. This provision, that when CLs are issued on grounds of national emergency countries are released from \nprocedural obligations, is often misrepresented to suggest that countries can only issue CLs in national \nemergencies. To repeat, countries can issue CLs on whatever grounds they establish in national legislation, \nbut in times of national emergency (and government use) they can bypass negotiations. \n15. Formally, early working (also called \u201cBolar\u201d) provisions are examples of limiting owners\u2019 rights of \nexclusion, but where they most matter regards the effective duration of owners\u2019 rights. \n16. Such provisions do not shorten patent terms but rather eliminate the effective extension of terms that is \nyielded by leaving a single firm with market exclusivity despite the patents\u2019 expiration. I am not addressing \ndata exclusivity. \n17. Guido Carlos Levi and Marco Antonio A.
