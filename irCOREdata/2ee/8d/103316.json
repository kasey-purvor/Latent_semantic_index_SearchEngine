Through the \nundertaking of activities, learners explore the relationship between words and pictures \nand consider the intersections and boundaries where these art forms cross and meet. As a \ntrained teacher, author\/illustrator and performance poet who extends his identity into the \nclassroom as part of his pedagogy (Connoisseurship and Criticism. Eisner, 1998), the \nauthor encourages learners and peers to also express individual and collective identities \nthrough innovative uses of images and words. An extracurricular writing group attended \nby FE, HE, Postgraduate and Access learners and staff has provided greater opportunity \nto explore many areas of writing relating to art and design practice \u2013 to enhance and \nimprove independent learning and communication within the university culture and \nwithout it, feeding into the secondary school 14\u201319 agenda, thereby addressing strategic \nWidening Participation targets. The results: a 50-session teaching pack \u2013 written and \n 1\ndelivered; papers presented at the 2008 University for the Creative Arts (UCA) Teaching \nand Learning conference, London; Learning and Skills Research Network (LSRN) \nconference, London 2008; 14\u201319 Agenda Seminar, Kings College University, London; \nHE Academy Annual conference, Manchester, 2009. Learners, having found greater \nidentity within a community (Communities of Practice, Lave and Wenger, 1998), continue \nto work with the author in co-facilitation roles to disseminate its findings into the wider \neducational community, and its challenging impact has led to the embedding of creative \nthinking and writing into FE, Access and BA (hons) Graphic Communication Courses at \nUCA, Kent and Surrey. The project has now entered the final phase of evaluation.  \n \n \nKeywords \ncreative writing \npersonal identity \nempowerment \nsketchbooks \nstorytelling \nreflective practice \n \n \nBreaking out: competencies, andragogy and experiential life journeys \nFor the art practitioner gaining a Post Graduate Certificate of Education (PGCE) after \nseventeen years of teaching, this proved to be the best continued professional \n 2\ndevelopment (CPD) in reflective and transformative practice \u2013 being able to reference \nintuitive and experienced education back to the theories that explained them was \nextraordinary. David Kolb\u2019s (1975) model of experiential learning encapsulates our \nshared (teacher and learner) practice in the studio, a cycle that allows us to get on or off \nat any point of a continuing sequence of phases where we (1) experience (2) observe and \nreflect (3) form concepts through understanding and (4) test the new situation and then \nstart again. And yet there appears to be a strong move towards multiple competency-\ndriven education: \u2018the measure of what someone can do at a particular point in time\u2019 \n(Unit for the Development of Adult Continuing Education, 1989: 6 (quoted in Tight \n1996)). As a business\/management model this may not suit the vocational creative \nneeding to strike a balance between accrediting set skills-based tasks and the thinking and \npractice that inform their processes. The Greek notion of competency as a \u2018relatively \npermanent quality of personality which is valued by the community to which we belong \n[\u2026] not simply a skill but a virtue; a general sense of excellence and goodness\u2019 [\u2026] that \n[\u2026] \u2018involves being up to those tasks that life presents to us\u2019. Brezinka (1988: 76) widens \nthe discourse for greater creativity in thinking, discovering and exploring new \neducational spaces beyond the measured methods of assessment and evaluation that are \ncommon to the framework within the academy. It offers permission for new approaches \nto literacy as related to art and design Further Education (FE) and Higher Education \n(HE). \nIt has been fascinating to watch Level 3 FE learners in transition from school pedagogies \n\u2013 being taught, responding to curriculum and gaining examinations \u2013 to becoming \nindependent, self-directed, \u2018andragogical\u2019 (Knowles 1984) learners with a need to build \n 3\non past experiences and delve deeper into themselves, to set and realize learning \nexpectations and fulfil life goals. Sketchbooks and journals are a major reflective tool \u2013 \nthey track our learning \u2013 a personal space to be explored, for experiments to be \nundertaken, analysed and evaluated so that we can learn and move on. Art and design \nstudents use words and pictures to discover and develop themselves, and for the tutor it \nwas recognized as the starting point of a journey into new outcomes of creative writing. \nJenny Moon (2006) cites the journal keeper, Ron Klug (2002), and his own particular, \npersonalized thoughts: \n \n\u2018A place to record daily happening, a journal is also a tool for self-discovery, an aid to \nconcentration, a mirror for the soul, a place to generate and capture ideas, a safety valve \nfor the emotions, a training ground for the writer, and a good friend and confidant\u2019. \n(Klug 2002: 1) \n \nAssumptions: reflection, meanings and jumping the gap \n \nAssumptions held for many years were suddenly challenged by self-reflection and \nmeasurement against the PGCE criteria. We use the language of art and design (it is our \ncultural standard and considered the correct protocol within art and design education) and \nwith it, the language of assessment and evaluation as laid down by examination boards. \nThe openness of the language allows for freedom of interpretation, but personal \nperception and experience has shown that assessment definitions \u2013 their meaning to \nindividuals, teachers and learners \u2013 fluctuates considerably (Tappenden et al. 2005), \n 4\nwhich can lead to confusion and misunderstanding, at best a considerable variation of \nintention. Where the grading criteria had been simply read to learners with no definition \nor discussion \u2013 grades are important to students who have grown up within this learning \nculture, and provide an excellent marker for personal development and targeting of future \ngoals \u2013 the assumption had been made that they understood.  \nTaking the examination grading of the Business and Technology Education Council\u2019s \nFurther Education qualification- the BTEC Edexcel National Diploma- and its \u2018merit\u2019 \ndefinition, \u2018purposefully investigate\u2019, they were asked what this meant to them in the \ncontext of a project. Many were unwilling to even attempt it, as they found it hard to \nunderstand what was being asked in the light of their own learning. Students and teachers \ndiscussed this issue and ALL were unsure. To include students in debate on these issues \nseemed correct, and, using the sketchbook as a tool, a workshop was instigated for a \ndozen learners, centred around thinking and writing to investigate further how we \nevaluate and assess, to question our approach to thinking (metacognition) to allow them \nto engage as fellow teachers in the processes of marking and collective moderation \n(Figure 1).  \n \nThey found meaning in this, were empowered by the experience, took greater ownership \nof the session and all reported a greater understanding as a result.  \nOne-to-one tutorials are a great place to investigate understanding in learning, and \nstudents are open to engage in deeper discussion. It is a time to read together their \nsketchbook evaluations and check progress. A realization began to emerge of learners \nwho had to jump across a huge gap when attempting to reference their progress in written \n 5\nform in the sketchbook. One student described a beautiful, researched Victorian \nphotograph, with eloquence beyond her years, but when I read her corresponding \nevaluation of the same, it merely described the source and external appearance with no \npersonal insight. Why was her verbal description so much better than her written one? \nShe had made an assumption based on previous knowledge and application: \n \n\u2018It is right isn\u2019t it? Is this not what the teacher wants?\u2019 (Tappenden 2007) \n \nOthers lacked the confidence to engage words for fear of getting it wrong or because they \nconsidered their literacy as poor. A learner explained how she was frustrated by past \nexperience and could not write evaluations. Despite having excellent drawing and \npainting skills, out of frustration she would scrawl obscenities over her sketchbook pages. \nBolstered by confidence in professional practice as author and illustrator, previous \nassumptions were dropped and the tutor began to proactively challenge language and its \nuses from the position of the art and design creative. \n \nTelling our stories: encouragement, enrichment and the ongoing experience \n \nEncountering students with good verbal articulation is not unusual \u2013 working with \nstudents who have poor writing skills is not either. Many lack the confidence to even \nbegin to read or write; they hate the idea, but with the right encouragement and exercise, \nshould they not be able to do so with greater confidence? Encouraging \u2018show and tell\u2019 \ntechniques prompts the inclusion of students who engage in lively discussion about their \n 6\nwork or even topical debate gleaned from the morning\u2019s papers at the beginning of a \nlearning session. Telling personal stories or jokey anecdotes grabs attention; they can link \ninto themes and get learners \u2018on-side\u2019. After listening to a quip or yarn, some feel boldly \ncompelled to follow with theirs (this can even happen with a large group over 35, \nespecially when they know their peers); where others are too shy or would rather not \nenact this type of role, they have been consistently seen to be more at ease, brought into \nthe group activities, and tend to be more ready to participate through the encouragement \nof their peers\u2019 willingness to tell stories or engage others in the group in interactive \nconversation. Our lives are built of ongoing experiences to be shared; they are our stories \nand mean much to our personal development and social interaction being charged with \nemotional currency, and as such, must affect our learning. By opening up with a level of \nvulnerability, it has been noticed that the teacher\u2019s own storytelling builds rapport, which \nin turn builds trust, confidence and a willingness to \u2018have a go\u2019 in a variety of learning \ncontexts. Jennifer Moon relates learning to the context of a wider world through stories. \nShe recounts that telling a story extends its value [\u2026] \n \n\u2018[\u2026] by widening its context from the world of the individual perception into the social, \npolitical and historical context of the individual\u2019. (Moon 2006: 122) \n \nCertainly, the telling of stories confirms our identity, enriches and encourages others and \nhelps to build a stronger sense of community in a group.  \n \nProfessional identity and change: Who am I, what do I have to offer? \n 7\n Not everyone is a willing or natural performer \u2013 a valid criticism levelled against some of \nthese suggestions \u2013 but everyone has a unique identity enhanced by life\u2019s experience and \nacquired knowledge \u2013 much of which extends beyond our subject specialisms, and some \nactivities even hone personal skills. We are our own \u2018stories\u2019, which our learners can \n\u2018read\u2019 into. For example, a sensitively quiet musician or reader, or one with an interest in \ntheatre or another aspect of culture, could deliberately weave a small part of his or her \npersonal interest into the learning environment. In his recent visit to the University for the \nCreative Arts (UCA), Dr Kevin McCarron, stand-up comedian and Roehampton \nUniversity lecturer in English Literature, alluded the comedy club to the seminar room, \nciting that the relationship of comic is closest to lecturer under the notion that the tutor is \nan \u2018act whose job it is to directly engage with the audience (students)\u2019 (McCarron 2007). \nComedy lecturer Dr Oliver Double at the University of Kent also parallels the nature of \nteachers to stand-ups, as  \n \n\u2018[\u2026] they have to organise their own time, take risks, cope with stress, think through \ntheir attitudes, play with ideas and see the world through different eyes\u2019.  \n(Double 2005: 262)  \n \nIn a world where value for money has become key and students \u2018buy\u2019 into their education \nto gain knowledge not just for its own sake but to use in the social and working world, we \nneed to realize who we are in the academic context and beyond. An actor friend soberly \nadvises that you can only begin where your two feet stand, consider what you have to use \n 8\nand use it well. Certainly, the postmodern politics of \u2018educational change \u2018weigh heavily \nin the consideration of professional identity within the institution. Goodson (2003) \nacknowledges that  \n \n\u2018[\u2026] increasingly, individuals live outside institutional and traditional patternings; they \nare at once more free, yet more bereft. People\u2019s personal missions of change have to be \nunderstood within this new frame of the quest for personal meaning. To remake the \nconnection between the institutional and the personal, we need to grasp each person\u2019s \nlife theme or his\/her story of purpose\u2019.  \n(Goodson 2003: 97).  \nThe challenge here is for teacher identities to be confronted and developed through \npersonal identity projects (so, for the reader and lover of words it may well be the \nexploration of creative writing coming from an identity as practical artist or designer), \nwhich can be integrated into the curriculum, where they are \u2018humanized\u2019 and \n\u2018galvanized\u2019 by a strong sense of internal mission. In seeking to expose a natural and \nspecific identity to bring about change in the teacher and learners for this particular \nresearch project, it was recognized that the context needed to be located both inside the \nuniversity and outside of it, reflecting the teacher\u2019s own personal and universal beliefs \nand missions, but also seen as being outworked within the educational frame as a \nprofessional project. The personal commitment would inspire change in the delivery of \neducation and hopefully allow ownership to be assumed by teachers and learners alike. \nTo seek internal change as fundamental to our development as teachers and learners is to \nreflect in the context of creative thinking and writing upon our stories, analyse them, \n 9\nrevise them, expand them and incorporate them into our practice. This process aligns \nwith the chain of change theory suggested by Sheehy (1981). \nSheehy\u2019s \u2018Phases of the creative process\u2019 and \u2018Phases of a successful passage\u2019 help to \nexplain the sequence of the process leading to transformation. Within the context of the \nbroad and various activities of creative writing for the practical art and design learner, \nthese stages of change offer a robust methodology that closely links the processes in \nliteracy with those of the visual, practical and performing arts.  \n \nPHASES OF THE CREATIVE \nPROCESS \nPreparation \nGathering impressions and images \nIncubation \nLetting go of certainties \nImmersion and Illumination \nCreative intervention \u2013 risk \nRevision \nConscious structuring and editing of \ncreative material \nDormancy \u2013 a creative pause for the \nreplenishment of self \nPHASES OF A SUCCESSFUL PASSAGE \nAnticipation \nImagining oneself in the next stage of life \nSeparation and incubation \nLetting go of an outlived identity \nExpansion \nDeliberate intervention in the life conflict \u2013 \nrisk \nIncorporation \nReflection on and integration of one\u2019s new \naspects \nDormancy \u2013 for rest, reward and play to offset \nstress of change \n                                                 (Sheehy 1981: 100) \n \n 10\nAs a reflective rationale, Sheehy aligns well with Sch\u00f6n and Eisner. The writing activities \noffered to the learners in curriculum workshops and a weekly, hour-long open access, \nnon-curricular creative writing group allow space for the self to be explored in the light \nof our lives being subject to ongoing change. To keep personal passion and an excitement \nin making possible discoveries through thinking and writing alive, while at the same time \ntranslating what is personal and dynamic into the context of the educational institution, \nthere exists a tension, but one that is vital to creative development and the unlocking of \npotential. Without the emotional connection (a place of tension) within a personal \ndomain, made possible through the \u2018chain of change\u2019, the tutor has come to realize that \nlearners may not write as effectively. Personal writings within learner sketchbooks, \nwhich although intended for course research and evaluation can lead the student to a new \nplace of learning. Here the individual may creatively explore with various forms of \nwriting within curricular projects and also in other extra-curricular contexts. Significant \ndevelopment is possible in such domains. Examples of students using their sketchbooks \nand written evaluation journals (some courses use two books to record both aspects) in \nthis way produce rich and varied content bringing out the unique qualities of the creator \ncan be seen in this study (Figures 2, 3 and 4). \n \nOf particular note within Sheehy\u2019s change methods are the Revision and Incorporation \nstages at the very end of the process. Having let go of writing inhibitions and the \nperception of former identities, which often suggest to learners that they \u2018are not good \nenough\u2019 and \u2018cannot do it\u2019, the students are encouraged to push themselves into a place of \ntaking risks, having a go. This requires space to reflect, rethink and rest, as it can be \n 11\nstressful. It is not the same as evaluating, in that it does not necessarily require an \nimmediate or active response. Every activity planned has this time added in, and for this \nreason sessions were and are offered with a week\u2019s gap. As a tutor in the context of this \nproject I have become sensitive to this need, where so often we are pushed on by course \ndemands and time restraints that could possibly in some circumstances inhibit creativity \nand the development of personal identity. Trusting personal experience to experiment \nwith new ideas of creativity in written and spoken language\/visual art and design in the \nknowledge that the risk is worth taking is central to this research and the author\u2019s \npedagogy, and is practised regularly in education. Working outside of prepared notes, \ntesting the boundaries of the class and encouraging learners to \u2018construct\u2019 new meanings \nhas brought deeper reflection and fulfilment to the learning environment. At worst, it fails \nand there is always tomorrow! The spontaneity has led to an engagement of intuitive \nteaching \u2013 what Donald Sch\u00f6n (1983: 87) has termed our \u2018theories-in-action\u2019, and after \nthe event our \u2018reflection-in-action\u2019. Elliott Eisner (1998) builds on this premise by \nsuggesting that we are \u2018Connoisseurs\u2019 of our own practice as professionals and when we \ndisseminate our skills through \u2018Criticism\u2019 we impart awareness and understanding \nthrough learning. Upon these foundational reflective principles the whole area of creative \nwriting began to be explored.  \n \nCreative writing: travelling in the head, across the page and into the virtual \n \nThe metacognitive nature of creative writing has freed the minds of learners and \nunleashed them to play again with their thoughts and construct them into their use of \n 12\nlanguage as an art and form of communication. \u2018Allowing time for the creative aspect of \nyour thought processes to come to the fore is very important for reflective teaching\u2019 \n(Hillier 2005), and so it was with the emergence of the group. A small initial response to \na sign-up board gradually swelled to 25 interested students across FE and HE at \nRochester campus. Sixteen attended the first session, and it has been consistently \nnumbering between eighteen and 30 per session since. The average number is 18. To \nencourage this voluntary Thursday lunchtime group, and give it the feel of something \nimportant, yet more informally separate from major subject areas, a decision was taken to \nconsider the skills in thinking and writing that would benefit student learning and \nincrease a personal love of reading and writing (Figure 5). This would hopefully have a \nknock-on effect on the academic contextual work and enable some of the enjoyment to \nfeed through and embed itself in the curricula. \n \nDavid Morley, Creative Writing course leader at Warwick University, sees the empty \npage as an open space with no dimension or time: \n \n\u2018Everything is possible, at this point endlessly possible. Anything can grow in it. \nAnybody, real or imaginary, can travel there, stay put, or move on. There is no \nconstraint, except the honesty of the writer and the scope of the imagination \u2013 qualities \nwith which we are born and characteristics that we can develop. Writers are born and \nmade\u2019. \n(Morley 2007: 1)  \n \n 13\nHe is all-inclusive in his statement, something that needed to be embraced for our \nlearners \u2013 a need to be inspired and envisioned in the potential of such a vast subject. The \nintention was to initially build a framework of ten sessions covering many aspects of \nreading and writing practice, including the variables of poetry, songwriting (Figure 6), \nfiction and journaling, to enable learning development and offer a chance to embed new \nskills into the various subject specialisms. The range would cover the breadth from poetry \nto e-learning, from fantasy to taking a literary walk. The tutor\u2019s role would be seen as \nfacilitator but also co-learner (in having a completely new subject to teach) \u2013 instigator of \ntheory and practice.  \nThe willingness of the learners to openly share from the outset was a joy to watch, and \none learner has remarked in a recent feedback questionnaire that \u2018after the first session I \nwent home, picked up my pen and just started writing and writing\u2019.  \nThis enthusiasm for those who have caught the bug continues to grow, as they develop \ninto a writing community within the hour-long sessions. The important driver here is \nonce again play. Feeling unrestrained and free out of the usual classroom or studio \nsetting, learners have talked about having their minds opened up, yet still finding \nstructure to help them to learn:  \n \nI enjoyed it and it opens up our minds and it opens up our paths to create writing and \nhow to do it and how to write and look at things in a much more different way as opposed \nto academic way where everything\u2019s kind of do this, this, this, this, this \u2013 this, this! \nI\u2019m not just saying that, as I said it opens up your mind so you think differently, being on \na course being in my actual main course at the moment, it is literally free story writing, \n 14\nwe have to learn how to write 3 part stories and stuff, the beginning middle and end sort \nof style and Curtis\u2019s (the author and facilitator) groups have allowed me to open up my \nmind on how to write things differently and kind of explore and really take in other plays \nof things, poetry and stuff. \n(Taken from a peer-to-peer interview, 2010) \n \n \nA community of practice: impassioned and dynamic \n \nThe anthropological studies conducted by Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger testify to the \nsuccess of learning where like-minded individuals learn naturally from each other in less \nformal social groupings. They suggest that we all belong to a number of \u2018communities of \npractice\u2019 in a range of different settings \u2013 e.g. work, school, home \u2013 both dutifully and in \nleisure. In some of the groups it is suggested that we have core roles, while in others we \nmay exist on the peripheries. Wenger defines communities of practice as: \n \n\u2018[\uf0bc] groups of people who share a concern or passion for something they do and learn \nhow to do it better as they interact regularly. Three components are required [\u2026] (1) the \ndomain (2) the community (3) the practice.\u2019  \n(Wenger 1998)  \n \nA community holds three dimensions according to Wenger: (1) What it is about \u2013 joint \nenterprise, understood and constantly renegotiated by its members \u2013 domain (2) How it \n 15\nfunctions \u2013 mutual engagement of members, which binds them as a social entity \u2013 the \ncommunity (3) Produced capability \u2013 shared resources (routines, sensibilities, artefacts, \nstyles, vocabulary, etc.) as produced by members over time \u2013 the practice. \nThe realization of this theory as practised by the group is of course only part of a larger \npicture that blends other theories (as mentioned in this text) and methodologies. By \nplacing such heavy emphasis on communities of practice alone would be to exclude more \nformal approaches to learning and the broader acquisition and development of \nknowledge. A group of learners might also be in danger of becoming over-romanticized; \nwith such wide differentiation defined by age and ability, members\u2019 behaviour could \nbecome modified to the point of non-collaboration or power struggles within the group \ndynamic.  \n \nWriters on a journey: meaningful and challenging: the evaluation-in-action \n \nWithin the first semester, two group members offered to take sessions and both were \nlesson-planned by them, leading to successful written outcomes in the sessions.  \nThe careful packaging of explanatory notes and references for each session is intended as \na \u2018ready to go\u2019 teaching pack for fellow tutors who wish to adapt the sessions to their \nown specific needs, and the course framework including all learning materials is loaded \nup onto \u2018MyUCA\u2019 Blackboard to enable University-wide dissemination and feedback on \na discussion board. In the three project phases there are now over seventy different one-\nhour sessions that can be adapted by teachers and learners where applicable. The group \ncan access other links to relevant YouTube clips, online journals and other writing sites. \n 16\nStaff and students at the Epsom and Farnham campuses have benefited from this service. \nIn sharing their work as writers who are artists, a number have begun to bring their \nwritten creativity into their contextual studies essays in the form of poems and creative \nprose. Their enjoyment is clearly key to the extension and reshaping of their knowledge, \nand some have expressed new feelings of \u2018power\u2019 emerging as they are realizing their \npotential.  \nEach session allows discussion and debate, and there is always a written task with a set \naim, the results of which are performed by group members. Most tasks are presented as \ngame activities and involve learners sharing their writing and reading with others. A \ngroup poem was especially successful worked over two sessions, based on the \u2018noise of \nsilence\u2019 where the students revealed their intuitive feel for rhythm, structure and creative \nwordplay (Figure 7). Amazingly, they were able to reference the poetry form and \ntechniques that had been instinctively used after the session, which made it far more \nexciting. \n \nFeedback from the group indicates that they find the sessions fun, absorbing, highly \nstimulating, meaningful, relevant, learning-producing, challenging, easy to follow and \nunderstandable. They value highly the shared experience and acknowledge the definite \nsense of informal, trusting community and the unique attitudes of individuals who make \nup the group. One second-year National Diploma FE learner has shared her thoughts on \nthe unique qualities, recognizing different forms of writing that take place and benefiting \nfrom others\u2019 opinions:  \n \n 17\n\u2018Umm, people and the group are good cos every one is different and unique in their own \nway and they have got a different idea of writing. I like the discussion part of it to get \nother people\u2019s opinions whereas you\u2019re all just writing tiny bits you get to hear and base \nyour opinions, err yeh. \n(Taken from a peer-to-peer interview, 2010) \nThat the group is different and sits outside of the curriculum framework yet allows \nstudents to feed from it and apply what they learn to their own individual learning \ncontexts is a good thing, but as one final-year photography undergraduate attendee states, \nit can be problematic prioritizing and separating: \n \n\u2018I need to be careful about the balance between the personal enjoyment and the personal \nneeds and the academic needs but I think also I enjoy writing more than perhaps I really \nrealise, and that there is something I am learning about my own aspirations about where \nI want to go in a postgraduate basis; where I can take writing. It perhaps is not a tool \nwhich is subject to other requirements too; it\u2019s actually something I want to do for itself \nand derive a lot of information and power, empowerment rather which I wouldn\u2019t \notherwise get\u2019. \n \nBut this student has talked too about the definite outcomes and affect on his work as a \nresult of attending and using the sessions as a \u2018tool\u2019 of process, which he feels many \nmore could benefit from: \n \n 18\n \u2018Having said that, I believe that what I have learnt in attending these courses is the \npower of writing as part of my process [\u2026] it does definitely fit in within the academic \nprocess and it\u2019s something, you know in talking to other students in my year for \nPhotography that I have tried to explain to them to try to encourage them to attend our \ngroup and always currently surprised that they resist that. They don't see writing as a \nvery powerful tool of process in the same way as I have learned to by attending these \ncourses, that you can actually attend something or indulge in an activity which does not \nseem related to the particular academic discipline that you are engaged in but yet the \nknock on benefits are very powerful and very important and can open up one\u2019s thinking \nand one\u2019s self knowledge which is a very important aspect I think of these sessions.\u2019 \n \n(Taken from a student dictaphone self-recording, 2010) \n \n \nThat the student refers to it as \u2018our\u2019 group illustrates the assumed position of ownership; \nit is clearly exercising the power to change through processes in different creative \nactivities, seemingly unrelated to those of an art and design course that are recognized to \nbe affecting the acquisition and use of knowledge.  \n \nThe work has developed to the point that it now encroaches on staff development \nsessions \u2013 Teaching and Learning CPD colloquium have been hosted for FE, HE and \nPostgraduate lecturers at Farnham and Rochester campuses \u2013 Widening Participation \n(WP) art-into-writing sessions in local secondary schools as sponsored by Aimhigher, \n 19\nKent and Medway and Aimhigher, Surrey \u2013 and is embedded into the contextual element \nof the National Diploma in Art & Design course at Rochester. Widening Particiption \n(WP) workshops for the 14\u201319 Diploma, Creative and Media curriculum also use \ncreative writing as a core basis from which projects are devised. \nWorkshops are now embedded into the Access course and BA (hons) Graphic Design \ncourse at Farnham. Successful activities have included a collaboration involving Dr \nOliver Double from the University of Kent \u2013 his stand-up comedy workshops and \nperformances from leading UK comedian Milton Jones.  \nPhase 2 of this research project (second academic year) received greater funding to help \nembed the research project into the wider University curriculum, and other inspiring \nprofessionals who engage words and pictures in their work have been invited to \nlecture\/perform and host skills workshops for our learners and to show future progression \nroutes into HE for students from local schools. Guest lectures included performance poet \nJohn Hegley, Walker Books children\u2019s novelist and illustrator Joshua Mowll, and John \nWatkiss, Hollywood film concept artist and graphic novelist (Figure 8). \n \n \nFigure 8: Professional guests: John Hegley, poet; John Watkiss, Hollywood concept \nartist\/comic book author; Joshua Mowll, children\u2019s novelist\/illustrator. \n \nMembers of the Creative Writing Group are also exploring potential usage of e-tools and \nInternet communication, and have begun to archive and publish their most recent \nwritings. Entries to a major creative arts journal competition made the longlist, where \n 20\nstandards for the year were extremely high. One of the learners, a mature Access student \nwith no formal qualifications and severe writing problems requiring one-to-one learning \nsupport, was commended for his poetry, and has also reported an improvement in his \nbasic writing skills and confidence with presenting to a group. His art practice is also \nsignificantly influenced by his writing where his diploma show work was a welded \nsculpture based on poetry writing explorations (Figure 9). \n \n \nFigure 9: Access student\u2019s writing influencing his art practice. \n \nPhase 3 \u2013 on a lesser funded budget \u2013 has been involved with embedding project \npractices into the curriculum, continuing to explore and address the students\u2019 needs \n(especially in the formalities of academic writing) through weekly open workshops \nnetworking and disseminating this research project across the national and international \nresearch\/learning and teaching culture, and evaluating findings to offer further \nrecommendation. \n \n \nFindings \n \nReflection is necessary on the distance travelled in this energetic Learning and Teaching \nproject \u2013 much has been tried, tested and learnt to help plan and enable future decisions \nfor the uses of creative thinking and literacy for art and design students within the \n 21\nacademy. Shaped through qualitative triangulation methods, action research projects, \nfocus groups, narrative inquiry (dictaphone peer interviews), questionnaires and staff \nfeedback, the following initial findings have emerged.  \n \nQuestionnaire data  \nOne hundred and twenty first-year FE students were offered the opportunity within their \nNational Diploma Course in Art & Design to attend a number of writing workshops. \nThey covered aspects of thinking and creative writing as relating to the curriculum. Two \nof the workshops directly related to the compulsory Key Skills in Communication units \ninvolving summarizing information from two different sources and writing formally and \nwithout errors. The ongoing expectation of the course is that learners will write in \nsketchbooks and journals (always a good indicator of formative progress and creative \ndevelopment) and use them as a reflective document of their practice. Learners also need \nto think analytically and critically and at times verbally discuss their and others\u2019 work \nwithin an open forum. A simple questionnaire (Figures 1.1, 1.2) was constructed that \nasked them the extent to which embedded \u2018creative workshops\u2019 (as discussed, adapted \nand created according to what has been learned through the creative writing group \nsessions) had helped them to develop or improve their skills in: \n \n1. Summarizing information from different sources \n2. Writing formally and without errors \n3. Journal writing (reflective, creative writing) \n4. Thinking and speaking critically and analytically \n 22\n Figures 1.1 and 1.2 show the responses to be positive where those who attended (virtually \nall of the year group) found that the workshops helped \u2018a little\u2019 or a slightly smaller \nnumber found that they helped \u2018a lot\u2019. Those who answered \u2018not at all\u2019 in their response \nto the questions numbered a quarter or less of respondents.  \nTutors on the course, who are fully aware that the students do not primarily choose to \nstudy on an art and design course to improve their literacy skills, have interpreted this \npositively. As has been mentioned, many arrive with literacy needs and struggle to make \nthe transition to becoming more independently motivated University students. The \nreading and writing skills they arrive with often show considerable weakness, and the \nembedding of these types of workshops can only help to improve the situation. The \nessays, which resulted in conjunction with a practical design project and research-based \ncase study relating to their practical design outcomes, were credited for their academic \nstructure and critical content. There were 106 scripts attaining the pass standard, just one \nreferral and fifteen non-submissions. This shows a definite improvement, which it is \nhoped could and will be improved upon (although the current radical change in course \nstructure may significantly affect future development of creative writing workshops in \nthe curriculum). That the construction of workshops always concerned personal meaning \nand identity and the development of self as learner in the activities may offer a credible \nreason for the positive responses recorded by the learners (Figures 1.1, 1.2). \nThe other triangulated data have been scrutinized and the following patterns have \nemerged in the following positive and negative outcomes:  \n \n 23\nPositive outcomes \n\u2022All learners have greater confidence. \n\u2022Better-ability learners have significantly improved learning, especially literacy and \nthinking creatively. \n\u2022Less-ability learners have made some improvements to literacy. \n\u2022Learners request first-year course (FE and HE) inductions of literacy relating to art \npractice, creative and critical thinking skills (positive and negative outcome). \n\u2022Learners request more formal teaching in basics \u2013 grammar, spelling, essay structures \n(positive and negative outcome). \n\u2022There is greater cohesion of staff practice (in integration of critical and creative writing). \nThere are social and educational benefits in informal learning through the \u2018community of \npractice\u2019 type model. \n \nNegative outcomes \n\u2022Devotee-ism. Students attracted to lead tutor and his pedagogy \u2013 comments suggest \ngroup existence may depend on him \n\u2022Pressures on already busy tutor to deliver (with perceived \u2018unique\u2019 skills)  \n\u2022Art and design staff \u2018feel\u2019 unable to deliver these skills \u2013 suggests greater specialist \nrecruitment OR staff training programmes? (positive and negative outcome) \n\u2022Sustaining the Creative Writing Group beyond this research budget; accessing funding \ncould be difficult \n\u2022Difficulty communicating and disseminating work across five University campus \n 24\n\u2022Formal versus informal structure. Non-curricular course potentially difficult to justify \noutside of accredited assessment-based programmes \n\u2022Finding a place and role for creative writing etc, and it establishing a recognized identity \nwithin the institution. \n \n \nThe positive and negative outcomes seem to balance. The impression gained from the \ndata that have been tested suggests that the increased energies devoted to creative writing \nrelating to art and design practice and personal identity have resulted in measurable \noutcomes for the learners as evidenced in portfolio work, it being constructed of journals, \nsketchbooks and formal academic writing. There is much room for continued research, \nfocusing on key issues around the subjects relating to our attitudes (1) as teachers \u2013 to \nhow we recognize the changes occurring within the academy and its expectations and \ndefinitions of various modes of writing as relating to art and design practice; and (2) for \nthe learners \u2013 to encourage the exploration of creative innovations for learning and \nteaching using critical thinking techniques, creative writing, academic and structured \nwriting, which all feed into and weave throughout their art and design practice: an \nintegrated and necessary approach that also helps to bring meaning to learning lives and a \nkeener ability to assess and evaluate. \n \n\u2018Enthusiasm continues to grow. The open space is still wide for treading confidently on a \ntrail of wonderful words \u2013 writing the way forward\u2019.  \n(Tappenden 2010) \n 25\n References \n \nBrezinka (1988), \u2018Competence as an Aim of Education\u2019, in B.
