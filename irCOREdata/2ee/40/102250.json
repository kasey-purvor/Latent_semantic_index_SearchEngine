Research on the construction of lesbian and gay identity has \nrepresented this process as carrying considerable potential for intrapsychic and \ninterpersonal stress and conflict.  This process may be rendered even more \npsychologically challenging for those whose identities feature salient components \nthat are not easily reconciled with a lesbian or gay identity.  An example of this is the \nsimultaneous holding of Jewish and gay identities.  This paper reports findings from \na qualitative study of 21 Jewish gay men in Britain.  Participants were interviewed \nabout the development of their gay identity, the relationship between their gay \nidentity and their Jewish identity, the psychological and social implications of holding \nthese identities, and strategies for managing any difficulties associated with this.  \nData were subjected to interpretative phenomenological analysis.  All but one of the \nmen reported experiences of identity conflict, arising mainly from the perceived \nincompatibility of Jewish and gay identities.  This was said to have impacted \nnegatively upon their psychological well-being.  Those who had received negative \nreactions to the disclosure of sexual identity within Jewish contexts often attributed \nthis to an anti-gay stance within Judaism and a concern with ensuring the \ncontinuation of the Jewish people.  Various strategies were said to have been used \nto manage identity threat, including compartmentalizing Jewish and gay identity and \nrevising the content or salience of Jewish identity.  Recommendations are offered for \n  \n \n 3\npsychological interventions which could help Jewish gay men manage identity \nconflict. \n \nKey words: gay; Jewish; identity; qualitative. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJewish Gay Men's Accounts of Negotiating Cultural, Religious, \n  \n \n 4\nand Sexual Identity: A Qualitative Study \n \nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, much of the research undertaken within lesbian \nand gay psychology was concerned with charting the stages and processes involved \nin the construction of lesbian and gay identities and the implications this may hold for \npsychological well-being (e.g., Cass, 1979, 1984; Coleman, 1982; Dank, 1971; \nLewis, 1984; Minton & McDonald, 1984; Troiden, 1979, 1989; Weinberg, 1983).  In \nmore recent years, there has been a recognition that the construction of lesbian and \ngay identity is influenced by the social and cultural contexts in which this process \noccurs and that lesbian and gay identity intersects in important ways with other \naspects of identity, such as cultural and ethnic identity (Cox & Gallois, 1996; Eliason, \n1996).  This has led to research - mostly in the USA - which considers the \ndevelopment of lesbian and gay identity within particular cultural and ethnic contexts \n(e.g., Chan, 1995; Greene, 1997, 1998).  The present study adds to this literature by \ninvestigating accounts of constructing gay identity within Jewish contexts in Britain.  \nNote that in this study, gay identity is referred to as a \"sexual identity\" largely \nbecause this is a standard term for denoting a personal and social identity centred \naround sexual orientation, although it is acknowledged that \"sexual identity\" can also \nrefer to factors such as biological sex and gender. \n \nIn Britain, Judaism consists of two main branches, i.e., Orthodox and Progressive.  \nThe Progressive branch can be further subdivided, chiefly into the Reform and \nLiberal movements, while Orthodoxy also covers a variety of traditions, ranging from \n  \n \n 5\nthe Orthodox mainstream of the United Synagogue through to the ultra-Orthodoxy of \nthe various Hasidic groups.  Orthodoxy represents the major form of Judaism in \nnumerical terms in Britain.  The different branches of Judaism can be differentiated \nin terms of their belief in the theological status of Torah, the Jewish scriptures (Cohn-\nSherbok, 1996) (although the Reform movement in Britain began for practical rather \nthan theological reasons: see Romain, 1990).  Orthodox Judaism holds to a doctrine \nof Torah min ha-shamayim or \"Torah from heaven\", which signifies a belief that the \nprecepts of Torah have been divinely revealed and are therefore immutable \n(Goldberg & Rayner, 1989).  Broadly speaking, Progressive Judaism views Torah as \ndivinely-inspired but with some elements open to revision in the light of modern \nscholarship and thinking. \n \nThe Torah seems to be clear in its prohibition of sexual activity between men and, by \nextension, male homosexuality.  Leviticus 18:22 states \"You shall not lie with a man \nas one lies with a woman, it is an abomination\" (The Chumash [the Jewish Bible], \n1993).  It continues \"A man who lies with a man as one lies with a woman, they have \nboth done an abomination; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon \nthemselves\" (20:13).  Although interpretations have been offered which represent \nthese and other apparent injunctions in the Talmud (a literature amplifying Jewish \nLaw) as irrelevant to the modern construction of lesbian and gay sexuality (Mariner, \n1995), these are not part of mainstream understandings.  The sinfulness attributed \nhere to same-sex sexual activity appears to render it impossible to be both gay and \nan observant Orthodox Jew.  As one commentator put it, to claim both identities \n  \n \n 6\nwould be akin to claiming to be a Jewish lover of pork (Unterman, 1995).  Even \nthough sexual orientation features explicitly in the Liberal movement's declaration of \nits inclusiveness (Union of Liberal and Progressive Synagogues, undated), lesbian \nand gay sexuality also continues to be a deeply contentious issue and a matter of \nsome debate within Progressive Judaism (e.g., see Seligman, 1996a, 1996b, 1997). \n \nDespite the above focus on religious injunctions against same-sex sexual activity, it \nis important to note that Jewish identity is not just a religious identity but also an \nethnic and cultural identity (but see Webber, 1997).  Many Jews will have little or no \ncontact with a synagogue but will still retain a Jewish cultural identity.  The Jewish \ncultural context can be seen as based upon certain values and expectations such as \nthe importance of the traditional family.  For secular Jews, even though many of \nthese values and expectations were originally formulated within religious contexts, \nthey may still remain culturally important and salient. \n \nIn all branches of Judaism, the creation of one's own family through marriage and \nparenting is a clear cultural expectation (Solomon, 1995; Unterman, 1995).  The \ntraditional family is the core constitutive unit within Jewish communities.  There is \nalso considerable emphasis on the need to ensure the continuation of the Jewish \npeople.  This concern has its roots in the persecution of Jews through the ages and \nattempts to eradicate Jewish communities, culminating in the Shoah or Holocaust.  It \nhas therefore been suggested that in Jewish communities, the failure to marry and \nreproduce is seen as \"akin to communal treason\" (Unterman, 1995: 68), while \n  \n \n 7\n\"sexuality that is not reproductive may be viewed by group members as instruments \nof genocide\" (Greene, 1994: 244). \n \nGiven these viewpoints, values and expectations, it can be hypothesized that the \nholding of lesbian or gay identity and Jewish identity potentially places an individual \nin a situation of identity conflict and identity threat.  Identity conflict arises when two \n(or more) identity components that are relevant to and are held by an individual (in \nthis case, gayness and Jewishness) are experienced as being in some way \nincompatible.  Such conflict (or, more specifically, the identity component - gayness - \nthat demands assimiliation into the identity structure but which is incompatible with \none or more existing identity components - Jewishness) may pose a threat to \nidentity.  In Breakwell's (1986, 1992, 1996) identity process theory, identity threat is \ndefined as arising when at least some of the principles which define desirable end \nstates for identity (the most common ones being self-esteem, continuity, positive \ndistinctiveness and self-efficacy) are perceived to have been challenged. \n \nMany writers have explored the potential conflicts between lesbian and gay identity \nand religious identity (e.g., Bouldrey, 1995; Gillman, 1988; Litzenberger, 1994; Perry \n& Lucas, 1987; Rosser, 1990; Saunders & Stanford, 1992; Sweasey, 1997), \nincluding Jewish identity (Balka & Rose, 1989; Dworkin, 1997; Lampert, 1995; \nRaphael, 1995; Solomon, 1995; Unterman, 1995; see also Corker's, 1996, case \nstudy of the interaction between Jewish, gay and deaf identities and Brown's, 1991, \nconsideration of the potential complementarity of being lesbian and Jewish).  \n  \n \n 8\nHowever, few of these writings have taken the form of empirical research.  Moreover, \nthe research that has been conducted has tended to be structured and quantitative, \ngiving relatively little sense of the intricacies of people's lived experiences (with \nSweasey's, 1997, work on lesbians' and gay men's experiences in spiritual and \nreligious contexts being a notable exception). \n \nThe present study aimed to redress this imbalance and to explore whether identity \nconflict was reported to have been experienced by a group of Jewish gay men when \nconstructing their gay identity; if so, to establish its nature and sources; to determine \nhow such conflict was managed and resolved; and to identify the psychological \nimplications of these processes.  These questions were addressed qualitatively \nthrough an examination of the men's first-hand accounts of their experiences.  The \ninterpretation of the data was informed by - but did not seek to test - Breakwell's \n(1986) identity process theory and her work on coping with threatened identities (see \nDevine-Wright & Lyons, 1997, and Johnson & Robson, 1999, for other examples of \nempirical work which used this theory in the same way). \n \nWhile some of the experiences which the present study recounts may also \ncharacterize the experiences of Jewish lesbians, there are undoubtedly significant \npoints of difference because of the different positions, responsibilities and \nexpectations of men and women within Judaism (Beck, 1982).  This may compound \nthe existing differences between lesbian women and gay men (Hart & Richardson, \n1980; McConnell, 1994).  It was therefore decided to focus on the experiences of \n  \n \n 9\none gender only and to leave it to other researchers to conduct parallel research with \nJewish lesbians. \n \n \nMETHOD \n \nParticipants \n \nAttempts were made to recruit self-identified gay men who had at least one Jewish \nparent and had grown up in a home where one or both parents were Jewish.  This is \na broader definition of Jewishness than that adhered to by Orthodox Judaism, where \nJewish status is conferred by having a Jewish mother (or through having converted \nto Judaism under the auspices of an appropriate body) (Goldberg & Rayner, 1989).  \nThis broader definition was adopted because the study was not focused only on gay \nmen from traditions which adhered to the idea of Jewish status being conferred \nmatrilineally.  Twenty one participants were recruited through advertisements in the \ngay press and the Jewish press, through an appeal in the newsletter of the Jewish \nGay and Lesbian Group, through a London Reform synagogue which has a sizeable \nproportion of gay men in its congregation and by \"snowballing\" from those who \nvolunteered through these channels, with the aim of accessing men who were less \ninvolved in gay affirmative Jewish contexts.  When describing the study to potential \nparticipants, care was taken not to convey the hypothesis about identity conflict \nbecause of the risk of failing to attract participants who had not experienced conflict. \n  \n \n 10\n Therefore the study was simply described as being interested in the experience of \n\"growing up Jewish and gay\". \n \nInterview Schedule \n \nNineteen men were interviewed face-to-face about their experiences of constructing \nand managing Jewish and gay identities.  Two men, who lived in locations which \nwere geographically distant from the researchers, filled out a self-completion \nquestionnaire consisting of the same open-ended questions that appeared on the \ninterview schedule.  This schedule began with demographic questions, which were \nfollowed by questions on their Jewish socialization; the construction of sexual identity \nand their reactions to this process; the relationship between Jewish and sexual \nidentities and the management of any difficulties which arose; the disclosure of \nsexual identity to parents and within Jewish communities; and conceptualizations of \ntheir current identity.  Due to the nature of the research topic, a sensitive method of \ninterviewing was used which was based upon an interactional style derived from \ncounseling (Coyle, 1998; Coyle & Wright, 1996).  The interviews lasted between one \nhour and two and a half hours.  All were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. \n \nAnalytic Strategy \n \nThe data were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) \n(Smith, 1996a; Smith, Flowers, & Osborn, 1997; Smith, Jarman, & Osborn, 1999).  \n  \n \n 11\nThis recently-devised procedure has been used to analyze qualitative data on a \nrange of health and well-being topics (Flowers, Smith, Sheeran, & Beail, 1997, 1998; \nGolsworthy & Coyle, 1999; Holmes, Coyle, & Thomson, 1997; Jarman, Smith, & \nWalsh, 1997; Macran, Stiles, & Smith, 1999; Osborn & Smith, 1998; Smith, 1999).  \nIPA provides a systematic way of analyzing qualitative data that aims to explore \nparticipants' experiences, cognitions and meaning-making.  At the same time, there \nis a recognition that the outcome of any qualitative analysis represents an interaction \nbetween participants' accounts and the researchers' interpretative frameworks.  \nHence, the analytic process is both phenomenological and interpretative.  While it is \nnot claimed that the thoughts of an individual are transparent within verbal reports, \nanalysis is undertaken with the assumption that meaningful interpretations can be \nmade about that thinking (Smith et al., 1997). \n \nGood qualitative research should be transparent about its process of analysis \n(Smith, 1996b).  It is therefore necessary to outline the analytic procedure \nsystematically.  The first step involved repeated reading of the transcripts which \nresulted in notes being made on each transcript regarding key phrases and \nprocesses.  These notes included summaries of content, connections between \ndifferent aspects of the transcript (i.e., there was an orientation to issues of both \ncontent and process) and initial interpretations.  Within each transcript, these notes \nwere then condensed to produce initial themes, with care being taken to ensure that \nthese themes were consistent with and could be illustrated by the data.  When this \nprocess had been repeated with each transcript, the resulting sets of initial themes \n  \n \n 12\nwere examined to identify recurrent patterns across the transcripts, producing a final \nset of superordinate themes.  The links between these themes and the data set were \nchecked again at this stage.  Themes were then ordered in such a way as to \nproduce a logical and coherent research narrative.  While the themes and \nsubthemes arose from the analysis of the data, inevitably some also reflected the \ncontent of the interview schedule, with general topics on the interview schedule \nbeing elaborated into more specific themes and subthemes through the analysis.   \n \nThe quantification of themes was eschewed because the aim of IPA is to produce a \ndetailed, analytic account of the nature and range of experiences in a particular \ndomain, drawing upon prior knowledge and theory where appropriate, rather than the \nquantification of data.  Also, note that, although the emphasis was on discerning \ncommonalities, accounts of individual experiences were not jettisoned as these \nsometimes extended an understanding of the complexity of the common themes and \nthe processes that underpinned them. \n \nInevitably such an analysis involves a high degree of subjectivity as it is shaped by \nthe researchers' interpretative frameworks.  However, in this study, it was hoped that \nthe researchers would be sensitized to different aspects of the data set due to their \nrespective positions as a non-Jewish gay man who is familiar with Judaism and a \nJewish heterosexual woman who is knowledgeable about gay sexuality, thereby \nyielding a rich analysis.  Furthermore, it was hoped that each researcher would be \nable to identify and compensate for the \"blind spots\" of the other and curb any \n  \n \n 13\nidiosyncratic interpretations. \n \nThis subjectivity means that traditional criteria for evaluating research quality (such \nas reliability), which are based on an assumption of researcher objectivity and \ndisengagement from the analytic process, are inappropriate in assessing this study \n(Henwood & Pidgeon, 1992).  Among the alternative criteria which qualitative \nresearchers have suggested is the criterion of persuasiveness by \"grounding in \nexamples\", which is applied through an inspection of interpretations and data (Elliott, \nFischer, & Rennie, 1999; Smith, 1996b).  In this paper, interpretations are illustrated \nby extracts from the data set (to the extent that space permits), with the aim of \nallowing readers to assess the persuasiveness of the analysis for themselves.  In \nthese quotations, empty brackets indicate where material has been omitted; \ninformation that appears within square brackets has been added for clarificatory \npurposes; and ellipsis points (...) indicate a pause in the flow of participants' speech. \n Pseudonyms have been used to indicate the varied sources of the quotations. \n \nDue to the narrative presentation of findings associated with IPA, the traditional \ndivision of a research paper into separate results and discussion sections has been \nreplaced by an analysis section where main themes are presented and interpreted \nand an overview section where consideration is given to the implications of the \nresearch for psychological practice. \n \n \n  \n \n 14\nANALYSIS \n \nDemographic Information \n \nParticipants' mean age was 37.2 years (range 19-67; SD 11.6).  In terms of their \nhighest educational qualifications, seven (33.3%) had a postgraduate degree or \ndiploma, six (28.6%) had a degree, five (23.8%) had qualifications equivalent to \nGCSEs\/O-levels, two (9.5%) had A-levels (or equivalent qualifications) and one \n(4.8%) had a diploma.  Using the International Standard Classification of \nOccupations (International Labour Office, 1990), 12 (57.1%) were classified as \nholding professional jobs; two (9.5%) were senior managers or officials; and one \n(4.8%) was located in the category of service, shop and sales workers.  Two \nparticipants (9.5%) were students.  Of the four (19.0%) who were currently \nunemployed, three had previously been in professional occupations and one had \nnever held a full-time job.  At the time of the study, all the participants lived in urban \ncentres within Great Britain, mostly in or around the London area. \n \nIn terms of their current Jewish affiliations, 16 (76.2%) described themselves as \naffiliated with Progressive Judaism, four (19.0%) with Orthodox Judaism and one \n(4.8%) was unable to define himself in these terms.  Ten (47.6%) described \nthemselves as not very religiously observant, five (23.8%) as not observant at all, \nthree (14.3%) as quite observant and three (14.3%) as very observant.  Ten (47.6%) \nfelt that their sense of being Jewish was currently very important to them, nine \n  \n \n 15\n(42.9%) said it was quite important and two (9.5%) were unable to say how important \nit was to them. \n \nExperience of Identity Conflict \n \nThe central hypothesis in this study was that simultaneously holding a Jewish and \ngay identity places an individual in a situation of potential identity conflict.  Of the 21 \nparticipants, 20 (95.2%) reported that at times throughout their lives, they had \nstruggled to reconcile the Jewish and gay aspects of their identity.  For example, \nNathan said: \n \n I just thought \"God [ ] Jewish people aren't like this\" [ ] If you're Jewish [] you \nknow, you could not be gay. \n \nThis comment echoes Solomon's (1995) observation about the Jewish perception of \nhomosexuality as \"quintessentially non-Jewish\".  The task of trying to reconcile the \ntwo was not described as something that was addressed at one particular point in \ntime (such as during adolescence or at the time when they were first engaged in \nconstructing a gay identity) and then resolved.  Instead, these participants described \nan extended process spanning many years that, for some, was still ongoing.  As \nJoshua explained: \n \n I think [ ] all during my life the Jewish and gay business and the intertwining in \n  \n \n 16\nmy life have dominated my thoughts. \n \nIn their explanations of the origins of identity conflict, most participants pointed to the \neffects of a negative evaluation of homosexuality within Judaism in both a religious \nand cultural sense.  For example: \n \n We're talking about a religion which on the whole is anti-gay. (Jeff) \n \n The general homophobia within the Jewish community can make it difficult to \nbe gay. (Darren) \n \n Homosexuality in the wider mainstream Judaism is still unacceptable. (Sam) \n \nThe quotation from Sam implies that there are contexts outside the Jewish \nmainstream where homosexuality may be accepted.  However, this \"mainstream\" \nwas consistently represented as negative and problematic in its views.  This negative \noutlook was attributed to the apparent injunctions against sexual activity between \nmen in the Torah: \n \n Alan:   Being Jewish and gay has been an issue [ ] You know, there are \nconflicts. \n Interviewer:  What are those conflicts for you? \n Alan:   The Bible [ ] Leviticus chapter blah blah blah. \"Man shall not lie \n  \n \n 17\nwith man\". \n \nIt was felt that, within Orthodox Judaism, because of the commitment to the idea of \nTorah min ha-shamayim, these injunctions were seen as carrying ultimate authority \nand so this outlook on homosexuality was difficult to change.  Although participants \ndid not draw upon cultural expectations concerning marriage and the family when \noffering explanations about the origins of Judaism's negative evaluation of \nhomosexuality, this factor was invoked to explain negative parental reactions to their \nsons' gay sexuality (which will be addressed in the next subsection). \n \nAs well as reporting experiences of identity conflict in Jewish contexts, several \nparticipants described identity conflict in gay contexts and related experiences of \nanti-Semitism within gay communities and organizations.  Several of the men who \ndescribed themselves as observant Jews reported experiencing discomfort in many \ngay environments because they felt that their outlooks and values prevented them \nfrom fitting in.  As Darren put it, drawing upon a particular construction of gay \ncontexts: \n \n Clubbing, cruising, taking drugs and being promiscuous are alien to me.  It's \nso...well, un-Jewish. \n \nThe experience of identity conflict was said to have carried a range of psychological \nimplications.  Several participants talked of this conflict having had a negative impact \n  \n \n 18\nupon their psychological well-being.  Recalling the effect of being pulled in opposing \ndirections by what he saw as irreconcilable identity components in his youth, Joshua \nsaid: \n \n I was an unhappy...almost suicidal young man...I suppose that was partly due \nto being...to having these two forces. \n \nFor Raymond, being Jewish and gay were experienced as \"two really [ ] distinct \nidentities\" which he tried to keep separate.  This compartmentalization of identity \ncomponents (which will be examined in more detail later) and its negative effect \nupon personal integrity and authenticity (see Markowe, 1996, on the potential \nimportance of this dimension in sexual identity) was said to have exerted a significant \ndetrimental effect on his sense of well-being: \n \n God, I think I went through a period when I thought I was schizophrenic...I \nwas paranoid, I was, you know [ ] not being true to who I was, I guess. \n \nAnother participant, Ben, talked of feeling that he had failed to live up to the ideals of \nTorah and the cultural expectations conveyed by his parents.  This was said to have \nresulted in him seeking psychiatric help in an attempt to dispel his sexual feelings for \nother men and ultimately attempting suicide: \n \n I attempted overdoses twice.  I saw it as a form of punishment - a type of \n  \n \n 19\nstoning if you like [ ] I'd read it was wrong in the Torah.  I'd also failed my \nparents because I was not going with a girl.  I put myself through electro-\nconvulsion therapy and in and out of psychiatric hospitals, hoping that \nsomeone was going to wave some kind of magic wand and - hey presto - [ ] \nthese thoughts [sexual attractions towards other men] will disappear and I will \nthen start feeling for a girl or woman...settle down and have children, thus \ntherefore honoring my family, my community...being a better Jew. \n \nBen's \"stoning\" simile here refers to the penalty prescribed for same-sex sexual acts, \nas discussed by the medieval codifier of Jewish law, Maimonides (Unterman, 1995). \n The suicidal behavior that Ben describes here is not unusual.  Research has \nconsistently found a markedly higher incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors \namong lesbian and gay young people than among heterosexual youth (e.g., \nD'Augelli & Hershberger, 1993; Hartstein, 1996; Rotheram-Borus, Hunter, & Rosario, \n1994).  A major contributory factor to this is the demanding experience of living with \na socially devalued sexual identity, perhaps with limited support from significant \nothers.  Such a situation has considerable potential for eroding psychological well-\nbeing (Coyle, 1993).  In the present study, however, participants attributed the \npsychological difficulties they experienced to the conflicts between Jewish and gay \nidentity components rather than to more general negative social representations of \ngay sexuality.   \n \nThe only participant who said that he had never experienced any difficulty in \n  \n \n 20\nreconciling the Jewish and gay aspects of his identity attributed this to a number of \nfactors.  Firstly, he reported that at the time he first thought he might be gay, he \ntalked to his rabbi about his feelings.  The rabbi was said not to have problematized \nthese feelings and disclosed that his own son was also gay.  The participant \nexperienced this as validating and as helping to counteract the more usual negative \nstance toward homosexuality within Judaism, thereby rendering gayness and \nJewishness more compatible for him.  Secondly, he reported that his sexuality had \nbeen accepted by his parents, which he also linked to the lack of conflict in his \naccount of his Jewish and gay identity.  This issue will be addressed next. \n \nImplications for Social Relationships \n \nThese identity conflicts were said to have carried implications for participants' social \nrelationships.  This section focuses on the nature and implications of the disclosure \nof sexual identity to parents and within Jewish communities. \n \nDisclosure to Parents \nThe majority of participants reported that one or both of their parents knew of their \nsexual identity.  Although most men said that they had informed their parents \nthemselves, in some cases the information had emerged through an indirect route, \nsuch as through other relatives.  A high degree of third person disclosure to other \nfamily members was said to have occurred.  Selective disclosure and the \nmanagement of information about sexual identity may be particularly difficult within \n  \n \n 21\nthe Jewish community in Britain because of the close interrelations that characterize \nthis community.  One participant cited this as a reason why he decided to disclose to \nhis parents: \n \n I literally thought \"I've got to tell people\", especially in the Jewish community.  \nI mean, you tell one person something - there may only be three hundred \nthousand Jews [in Britain] but by the end of the week everyone will have \nheard about it so I just decided that that was the time to do [it]. (Robert) \n \nRegardless of whether disclosure was direct or indirect, parental responses were \ndescribed as varied and changeable over time.  The range of responses was similar \nto that reported in studies of disclosure among gay men in the general population \n(e.g., Cramer & Roach, 1988; Herdt & Boxer, 1993; Remafedi, 1987; Robinson, \nWalters, & Skeen, 1989) and so this will not be explored in detail here.  Initial \nnegative reactions included shock, distress, disgust, verbal abuse and a refusal to \ndiscuss the issue, while initial positive or neutral reactions involved seeking further \ninformation and providing support and reassurance.  The changes in parental \nresponses over time that were reported were also varied.  Some parents were said \nto have become more open and accepting after an initially negative response.  \nOthers restricted further discussion after having initially engaged with the disclosure \nin a relatively positive way, while others were said to have become more overtly \nnegative after initial acceptance. \n \n  \n \n 22\nParticipants' explanations for negative parental reactions to disclosure focused on \nparents' constructions of homosexuality as abnormal and as a mental health \nproblem.  However, half the participants said that their parents' main concern related \nto the continuation of their family and of the Jewish people.  They described parental \nconcerns about their sons not marrying, not creating a Jewish home and a Jewish \nfamily and not providing them with grandchildren.  Sam reported that because of this, \nin his parents' eyes, as a gay man he was \"a waste of manhood [ ] or a life\". \n \nParental connections with the Shoah or Holocaust were often invoked by participants \nto explain negative reactions.  Sam recognized this element in his father's distressed \nand verbally abusive response to his disclosure: \n \n I think the fact that my father lost so much family in the Holocaust was...I was \ngoing to continue that family and having a son was very important and having \nthe name was very important. \n \nThis may partly explain the sense of guilt and regret reported by the majority of \nparticipants who had encountered negative reactions from parents.  Reflecting on his \nfeelings about his mother's sadness that he would not have children, Alan said: \n \n That sense of grief kind of held...kind of stayed with me - that sense of \nsomehow I'd let her down. \n \n  \n \n 23\nThe Holocaust was also invoked by some participants who explained why they had \ndecided not to disclose their sexual identity to their parents.  For example, Ben \nexplained that he wanted his parents to maintain hope that he would marry and have \nchildren because both his parents were Holocaust survivors and Ben felt that their \ndesire for grandchildren was \"the only life they had left\".  He therefore felt that \n \n My responsibility was to keep grief from the two people - the nearest to me - \nwho had suffered more than anybody I'd ever know in my life. \n \nDisclosure within Jewish Communities \nAside from parents, the majority of participants reported that some people in their \nJewish social networks knew that they were gay.  The targets of disclosure included \nclose friends, rabbis, parental friends, colleagues and acquaintances.  Disclosure to \nthese people was said to have elicited the same range of responses as disclosure to \nparents.  One participant described how, when he disclosed his sexual identity to \none particular woman, he was confronted by the perceived impossibility of being \nJewish and gay.  He recalled their exchange thus: \n \n She said \"You're married?\".  I said \"No, I'm gay\".  She said \"You're joking\" \nand...she said \"You can't be\".  I said \"Why can't I be?\".  \"Well for a start you're \nJewish.  Jewish people aren't gay\". (Nathan) \n \nNegative responses were more commonly reported than positive ones.  These \n  \n \n 24\nresponses were attributed largely to an anti-gay outlook within Judaism, which was \nexamined earlier.  Most positive responses were encountered following disclosure in \ngay affirmative Jewish contexts.  These responses were generally experienced as \nvalidating the individual's identity, including their sexual identity, and enabling that \nidentity to act as a channel for attaining desirable identity goals such as self-esteem \n(Breakwell, 1986).  Participants who had received tolerant or accepting responses in \nother Jewish contexts explained this in terms of the closeness of their relationship \nwith the person whom they told or the nature of the role they played within their \ncommunity setting.  For example, Toby felt that his sexual identity was tolerated \nwithin his synagogue because of the major input which he provided into community \nactivities.  Describing what he saw as the conditional nature of this tolerance, he \nobserved: \n \n I'm of use to people as I do quite a bit of committee work charity wise and \nthey have to accept me. \n \nThe few participants who said that no one in their Jewish social networks knew that \nthey were gay were all Orthodox Jews.  They explained their non-disclosure in \nJewish community contexts in terms of the particularly negative Orthodox outlook on \nhomosexuality (\"They regard it as a sin - a terrible sin\" - Ben).  Darren expressed \nconcern that if his rabbi and community discovered that he was gay, they would \npathologize him and try to \"sort [him] out\" by attempting to force him into marriage.  \nHe expressed concern that, as a practising Orthodox Jew, his position within his \n  \n \n 25\ncommunity would become untenable if his sexual identity were known and that his \nparents' position would be compromised: \n \n I feel that my parents who are quite well known and respected within the \ncommunity would be ostracized and I do not wish to see them being hurt. \n \nStrategies for Minimizing and Coping with Identity Conflict and Identity Threat \n \nParticipants who attempted to ensure that information about their sexual identity did \nnot become disseminated within their Jewish communities reported that they \nemployed a variety of strategies to achieve this.  One of the chief strategies involved \ntaking care about the extent to which they engaged with others within these \ncommunities in order to avoid having to discuss relationships and other matters \nrelating to sexuality - \"keeping a very low profile\" as one participant put it.  This could \nbe seen as a variant of the isolation strategy for coping with identity threat that \nBreakwell (1986) noted: here the individual isolates themselves to minimize the risk \nof experiencing rejection (and thereby having their self-esteem undermined and \nfinding themselves with a negative form of social distinctiveness) because of the \nidentity position that they occupy.  This was not without psychological costs, with \nsome participants speaking of their dissatisfaction at having to lie and maintain a \ndistance from others.  Several said that this led to feelings of loneliness and a \ngeneral wariness in other relationship contexts.  As Ben said: \n \n  \n \n 26\n Very seldom have I had actual relationships that have lasted because I am \nscared of letting anybody that near. \n \nOther strategies involved complying with community expectations around \nheterosexual dating and simply lying.  One man engaged in compliance to the extent \nof getting married, although this marriage eventually broke up.  The same strategies \nwere reported by the men who had told very few people in their Jewish social \nnetworks about their sexuality.  These men also adopted a strategy of very selective \ndisclosure, telling only those whom they felt sure would not react negatively. \n \nThe majority of participants spoke of how they had managed information about their \nsexual identity by compartmentalizing the Jewish and gay aspects of their lives at \nsome time.  This involves creating strict boundaries around the threatening aspect of \nidentity - in this case, the gay aspect - and keeping it separate from the rest of the \nidentity structure (Breakwell, 1986).  For some men, this was experienced as a \nroutinized and unproblematic way of dealing with identity threat and avoiding identity \nconflict.  For example, Darren described it as \"a balancing act that has so far \nworked\".  Ben explained that his Orthodox Jewish life and his gay life were \ncompletely compartmentalized: \n \n I've lived with all these in various separate compartments for so long, I don't \nthink I can remember much of another way of life. \n \n  \n \n 27\nHowever, others reported finding this situation stressful, with Joshua, for example, \ndescribing it as \"awful\" to have two separate lives. \n \nThose men who had encountered negative reactions to the disclosure of their sexual \nidentities within Jewish communities often reported that they coped with this situation \nby disputing the right of the other person to judge them in this way and delegitimizing \ntheir views, thereby reducing any identity threat that these responses might have \ncreated (such as their potentially corrosive effect upon self-esteem or the attribution \nof negative distinctiveness to the person).  For example, having encountered a \nnegative response from his rabbi, Nigel said that he relied upon other sources of \nauthority (i.e., himself and God) for determining how he should behave (see also \nSweasey, 1997, on this): \n \n He [the rabbi] refused to talk to me [ ] [but] I do what I want to do - not what \nthe rabbis say one should do because it [being gay] doesn't make me...[ ] if \nthere is a good God...less of a Jew. \n \nThese strategies for managing information about sexual identity or negative \nresponses to disclosure can be understood as methods of minimizing or coping with \npotential conflict between the Jewish and gay aspects of identity.  Other strategies \nfor coping with identity conflict and threat involved participants changing their \nrelationship with Judaism.  A few men said that they tried to cope by increasing their \nreligious involvement and commitment in the hope that it would dispel same-sex \n  \n \n 28\nsexual feelings or to try to make up for the perceived failing of being gay.  Reflecting \nupon his general coping strategy when he first became aware of his sexuality, Ben \nsaid: \n \n I made a conscious decision that I would study more and I became [ ] a very \ndeep believer [ ] It was very doubtful indeed that I was going to get married to \na woman [ ] so part of my deepening into my Judaism I suppose was an \nattempt to make up for that part. \n \nHowever, most participants reported that they decreased their involvement with \nJudaism in order to manage feelings of identity threat and avoid identity conflict.  \nThis interpersonal strategy had intrapsychic origins.  Identifying religious prohibitions \non homosexuality as lying at the root of their identity threat, many reconstructed their \nJewish identity in cultural and social terms and decreased or ceased their religious \ninvolvement.  Explaining his rejection of the religious aspect of his Judaism, Alan \nsaid: \n \n I suppose the part of me that wants to throw away the religion is saying you \nknow \"Well, you know, you don't tell me what to do.  I'm not hurting you or \nanybody else so, you know, get off my case\". \n \nBy doing this, these participants revised the content and context of their Jewish \nidentity, thereby reducing the potential for their Jewish identity to conflict with their \n  \n \n 29\ngay identity.  Many men - including some who did not report having revised the \ncontent of their Jewish identities - dealt with identity threat by downgrading the \nimportance of their Jewish identity within their overall identity structure at some time. \n \nSeveral participants identified their socialization within Judaism as having provided a \nresource which helped them to undertake identity revision.  These men represented \nJudaism as a tradition which is characterized by and encourages a questioning, \ninquiring approach rather than a passive acceptance of things as they are.  For \nexample, Jon said: \n \n I think with Judaism [ ] you know, it really encourages you to question things [ \n] so I think it really encouraged me. \n \nThis questioning approach took Jon back to the Leviticus text which many \nparticipants identified as the basis of Judaism's anti-gay stance.  In his interview, he \nled the interviewer through a lengthy exegesis of this text, challenging the \nassumption that it refers to gay sexual activity and concluding \"that [the text] has \nnothing to do with me\".  Moreover, this reinterpretative strategy led him to discern an \naffirmation of gay sexuality in the Bible, an interpretation which enabled him to see \nhimself and his sexuality reflected there, boost his self-esteem and interpret the \ndistinctiveness accorded by his sexuality in positive terms: \n \n I was also really influenced by the story of David and Jonathan [ ] It begins \n  \n \n 30\nwith David appearing at the court of Saul and you're told that Jonathan just \nlooks at him and, you know, instantly he sees him \"and his soul loved \nJonathan's soul and was knit to his soul\" [ ] and then later they, you know, \nthey...[ ] they go out into the field and we don't quite know what happens you \nknow.  It says that they kissed and \"held one another until David...was made \ngreat...was caused to be big\" [ ] It just seems so clear to me that whatever \nthey got up to, whatever they felt, that's what I felt.  I feel like...I felt like David \nand Jonathan and that's in the Bible.  It's OK.  And...I don't care when people \nsay \"Oh but that wasn't really homosexuality\".  The fact of the matter is [ ] the \nlanguage is very close to sort of expressions of ardour or romance or \nwhatever you want to call it...call it my life and there it is in the Bible, you \nknow.  I couldn't find a more explicit affirmation. \n \nAnother way in which Jewishness constituted a resource for coping with being gay \nwas identified by several men.  These men described how their experience of \ndealing with a sense of difference and disconnection from wider society on account \nof their Jewishness had prepared them to deal with similar feelings that arose from \ntheir sexual identity, thereby echoing writing which has identified parallels between \nthe Jewish experience and the lesbian and gay experience (Brown, 1991; Dworkin, \n1997; Rogow, 1989).  Recalling his experiences of growing up Jewish in a small, \nrural, mining town, Jeff said: \n \n If you can say \"I'm different\" once in the face of that, then you can say \"I'm \n  \n \n 31\ndifferent\" again in a different light [ ] And it really really helped. \n \nJewish identity was thus not a uniformly problematic issue in relation to sexual \nidentity.  For some, it was also said to have provided a resource for coping with \nsocially devalued difference. \n \nSeveral participants reported that they had dealt with feelings of identity conflict by \nseeking out such communities where they could experience a sense of belonging.  In \nthe UK at the time of writing, there are a number of such contexts in existence, i.e., \nthe Jewish Gay and Lesbian Group, the Chofetz Chaim Foundation (an Orthodox \ngroup for lesbians and gay men: see Glaser, 1999) and Beit Klal Yisrael (a \nsynagogue which has a policy of inclusiveness and which is affiliated with Reform \nJudaism).  This seeking of group support has been recognized as an important \nstrategy for coping with identity threat generally (Breakwell, 1986) and also with the \nthreat that may be experienced by lesbians and gay men who hold religious beliefs \n(Sweasey, 1997).  For example, some participants described the acceptance of both \nsalient aspects of their identity that they found at one synagogue: \n \n Everyone accepts my Judaism and my gayness and there's no problem \nwhatsoever and they accept me as a person. (Derek) \n \n It wasn't until I actually [ ] started going to the synagogue I go to now that I \nactually feel that yes, I can walk in the door as a whole person.  I don't have to \n  \n \n 32\nleave a little piece of myself at the doorstep and go in as someone else.  I can \nenter as the whole person that I am. (Sam) \n \nSimilarly, Clive contrasted the sense of belonging which he feels at the Jewish Gay \nand Lesbian Group with the feeling of marginalization that he experiences at his \nsynagogue: \n \n If I am in my own synagogue [ ] the majority of them [the congregation] are \nstraight couples.  I'm sort of [ ] on the fringe [ ] whereas in the Jewish Gay and \nLesbian Group one feels completely part of it. \n \nCurrent Feelings About Judaism \n \nGiven the experiences of identity conflict and identity threat and the perceived need \nfor information management, it is not surprising that participants reported a range of \ncurrent feelings toward Judaism.  Several expressed anger toward Orthodox \nJudaism and felt that they were not welcome within it because of their sexual \nidentity.  A few felt that gay men could derive nothing of benefit from Orthodox \nJudaism because of its anti-gay outlook.  Yet, despite feeling that they had to \ncompartmentalize their gay and Jewish lives, several Orthodox participants referred \nto the pleasure and satisfaction that they still derived from their Jewish lives.  Darren, \nan observant Orthodox man, described the tension in his situation in this way: \n \n  \n \n 33\n The general homophobia within the Jewish community can make it difficult to \nbe gay yet I still have feelings of loyalty towards the community [ ] I don't love \nJudaism any the less for it [ ] What I do find difficult to reconcile is that my co-\ncongregationalists in synagogue would probably ostracize me if they knew I \nwas gay. \n \nSeveral participants noted that negative attitudes could also be discerned within the \nReform tradition of Judaism and pointed to matters related to lesbian and gay \nsexuality which have caused controversy there, such as same-sex commitment \nceremonies (see Seligman, 1996a, 1996b, 1997).  In the light of these discussions, \nsome participants stressed the importance of there being \"safe\" communities and \ncontexts within Judaism for (lesbians and) gay men. \n \n \n \nOVERVIEW \n \nThis study points to some of the difficulties that may be experienced by Jewish men \nwho are trying to construct a gay identity and who are trying to find ways of \nreconciling Jewish and gay identity and managing information about their gay identity \nwithin Jewish contexts in Britain (and - although this was only mentioned briefly by a \nfew participants - managing information about their Jewish identity in gay contexts).  \nWhile there is some overlap between the challenges described by the men in this \n  \n \n 34\nstudy and those reported by participants in studies of gay identity construction in \nmore general contexts, what distinguishes this study is the role which participants \naccorded to Jewish cultural contexts in shaping these challenges.  The study also \nindicates what the implications of these identity challenges might be for the \npsychological and social well-being of the men concerned and identifies some ways \nin which difficulties might be managed.  Yet, any conclusions drawn from this data \nset must be tentative because of questions about how representative these \nexperiences are of the experiences of Jewish men who are negotiating sexual \nidentity issues in Britain today.   \n \nThe data set consisted of the retrospective accounts of adult men, with the youngest \nparticipant being 19 years old and the oldest 67: this latter man was, however, an \noutlier in terms of age.  Although data which were felt to be historically specific have \nbeen omitted from the analysis, the social contexts which these men evoked may \ndiffer from those in which Jewish gay men today are embedded.  Furthermore, it \ncould also be argued that the retrospective nature of the accounts decreases the \nlikelihood that they constitute an accurate representation of the events and \nexperiences which they describe.  However, there exists research evidence to \nsuggest that retrospective reports and autobiographical memory are not necessarily \nand inevitably inaccurate and unstable (e.g., Blane, 1996; Brewin, Andrews, & \nGotlib, 1993; Neisser, 1994; Ross & Conway, 1986; Rubin, Wetzler, & Nebes, 1986; \nWagenaar, 1986). \n \n  \n \n 35\nMore pertinently, the sample was drawn mostly from Progressive Jewish \ncommunities, with only four Orthodox men volunteering to take part, despite attempts \nto recruit from this branch of Judaism through \"snowballing\".  However, these were \ncurrent affiliations: the majority of the sample had grown up in Orthodox \nenvironments but had realigned themselves, mostly as a result of their struggles with \nsexual identity.  The experiences of the men who remain Orthodox have been \nparticularly attended to in the analysis because the process of constructing a Jewish \ngay identity seemed to have been especially challenging for these men.  Given this \nsituation, there is a need for further research which explores the experiences of a \nrange of Orthodox gay men in more detail, although the difficulties of accessing and \nrecruiting such a sample are considerable.  Others whose voices are missing from \nthe present study are men who dealt with identity conflict by \"denying\" one or other \naspect of their identity, such as gay men who no longer define themselves as Jewish \nin any sense and Jewish men who do not define themselves as gay, even if their \nsexual feelings and\/or sexual activity are significantly directed toward other men.  \nHowever, it is possible that these self-definitional positions may not signify \"denial\" \nbut may instead represent a more complex negotiation of identity challenges and \nmay reflect the limitations of the \"gay identity\" construct within ethnic and cultural \nminority contexts (Manalansan, 1996). \n \nAlthough concerns can be raised about the sample, the present study represents an \ninitial exploration of the research topic upon which other researchers can build.  For \npsychologists working with Jewish men, the study identifies one factor (i.e., the \n  \n \n 36\nnegotiation of sexual identity) that could possibly lie at the root of psychological \ndistress and that might be borne in mind when exploring such distress with \nindividuals from this group.  However, as studies of psychotherapy with lesbian and \ngay clients have noted, it is also necessary to avoid assuming that sexual identity is \ninevitably problematic for lesbians and gay men (Garnets, Hancock, Cochran, \nGoodchilds, & Peplau, 1991; Milton & Coyle, 1998). \n \nFor men who are struggling with reconciling Jewish and gay identities, interventions \nmay focus upon exploring the possibility of revising some aspects of Jewish identity \nthat are proving problematic.  Drawing upon the interpretative tradition within \nJudaism (Sarah, 1995) and the questioning tradition identified by several \nparticipants, these men can be encouraged to locate credible resources that they \ncan use to reinterpret traditional Jewish views on homosexuality and fashion a \nversion of Jewish identity that can co-exist with a gay identity.  Others have \nsuccessfully trodden this path: Laura Brown, a Jewish lesbian feminist psychologist, \ntalked of having \"struggled to come up with a Midrash, an interpretation [of Judaism], \nI could live with\" and having been assisted by the realization that \"to be a Jew is to \nlive with contradictions and diversity\" (Brown, 1991: 49).  However, the social context \nof Jewish identity should not be ignored here.  While it may be possible to revise \nJewish identity at an individual level, this revised version may be implicitly or \nexplicitly challenged within family and community contexts.  The individual will need \nto find contexts in which a revised Jewish identity will be valued and supported.  \nAlso, resources may need to be identified for supporting parents who may be \n  \n \n 37\nstruggling to come to terms with their son's sexuality. \n \nHowever, in locating the roots of identity conflict within Jewish identity and more \nspecifically within Jewish outlooks on homosexuality, there is a danger of \npathologizing Judaism - or at least particular branches - and apportioning \nresponsibility for change solely to Judaism.  From a modern secular perspective, an \nOrthodox refusal to reconsider the nature of homosexuality on theological grounds \nmay be difficult to understand and it may appear as if religious text is being used to \njustify oppressive and outdated views.  Yet it is important to understand it because \nthis perspective will be shared by Orthodox men who may wish to find a way of \nmaking sense of their sexuality without abandoning a Jewish or Orthodox identity.  It \nis important to understand the Jewish and particularly the Orthodox context and \nlisten to the value that some of the participants in the present study attached to their \ninvolvement with Orthodoxy, despite the difficulties that it presented for them.  \nVarious strategies have been identified which can be used to facilitate the co-\nexistence of a(n Orthodox) Jewish and gay identity.  These include de-emphasizing \nthose aspects of Torah which cause problems - something which Unterman (1995) \nacknowledges as a standard strategy within many Orthodox communities for dealing \nwith other seemingly obtuse and irrelevant injunctions - or interpreting Torah \ninjunctions narrowly so that they are seen to refer to anal intercourse but not to \nprohibit other forms of same-sex sexual activity (Solomon, 1995).  Yet these \nstrategies are not without a price in terms of the demands of living with a \"bad \nconscience\".  In working with Orthodox men, it may be necessary to explore the \n  \n \n 38\npossibility of creating a version of gay identity that they can hold - even if this means \nthat it is only possible to reduce psychological stress to a manageable level - and \nidentifying appropriate sources of support. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \nBalka, C., & Rose, A.
