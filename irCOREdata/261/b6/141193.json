Donachie and Donachie (2002) described how the superior\nstrength of superalloys is achieved through precipitation strengthening with \uf067\u2019 phase (Ni3(Al,Ti)),\nand carbides which prevent the grain boundaries from sliding and migrating. Henderson et al.\n(2004) claimed that due to increasing material and manufacturing costs, gas turbine\nmanufacturers are investigating methods of repairing turbine components using fusion welding.\nUnfortunately, superalloys, like other precipitation-hardened alloys, are susceptible to liquation\ncracking during welding, and Post-Weld Heat Treatment (PWHT) cracking during the subsequent\npost-weld heat-treatment (Donachie and Donachie (2002)), which result in the component not\nmeeting the required specification.\nMost of the research on liquation cracking has focussed on the superalloy IN 738, although Sidhu\net al. (2009), Shahsavari et al. (2007) and Lim et al. (2002) have investigated Rene 80, which is the\nsubject of this article. In a study on the microstructure of over-aged, directionally solidified Rene\n80, Sidhu et al. (2009) found that welding caused constitutional liquation of \u03b3\u2019 precipitates, M5B3\nborides, MC carbides, and M2SC sulfocarbides in the heat affected zone (HAZ). A similar analysis\nby Shahsavari et al. (2007) on conventionally cast material showed that the phases that\nconstitutionally liquate depend on the prior state of the material. Therefore, MC carbides and \u03b3\/\u03b3\u2019 \neutectic islands liquate in as-cast material, MC carbides and borides in over-aged material and MC\ncarbides in solutionised material. Liquation cracking occurs when the material, that has been\nweakened by liquation is subject to contraction stresses from the cooling weld region. In addition,\nthe high temperatures from welding can exacerbate the issue of liquation cracking by causing\n4further precipitation of \u03b3\u2019 precipitates which harden the microstructure, reduce ductility and cause\nan additional contraction stress in the material \u2013 which in turn adds to the contraction stress from\nthe cooling weld.\nLim et al. (2002) and Sidhu et al. (2008) described how PWHT cracking can further exacerbate the\ncracking caused by liquation or initiate new cracks. The first stage of the PWHT generally involves\nsolutionising. While heating to the solutionising temperature, further precipitation of the \u03b3\u2019 phase \noccurs (in addition to the precipitation that may occur during welding which exacerbates the\nliquation mechanism) and causes further hardening, reduced ductility and contraction of the\nmaterial. When combined with the welding residual stresses, cracking can occur, both through\nthe nucleation of new cracks and the extension of existing cracks caused by liquation.\nAnother mechanism that can cause cracking in these high temperature materials is solidification\ncracking which is described in both Dye et al. (2001) and DuPont et al. (2009). The phenomenon\noccurs along the centreline of the weld pool during the final stages of solidification when a small\namount of liquid remains along the solidification grain boundaries and occasionally interdendritic\nsites. The contraction strains in the solidifying weld pool cannot be accommodated by the small\namount of remaining liquid, and result in a centreline crack. The phenomenon is generally\nexacerbated by impurities such as sulphur and phosphorus; as well as niobium, boron and\nzirconium which are intentional additions to these alloys. These elements segregate in the liquid\ndue to poor solubility in the solid phase. Weldability maps (for Gas Tungsten Arc Welding)\npresented in Dye et al. (2001) indicate that the phenomenon is more likely to occur when the\npower is high and the welding speed is low. As stated in DuPont et al. (2009), weld pools that\nhave a high depth to width ratio have increased susceptibility to this type of cracking.\n5One final method of cracking that can occur in nickel superalloys is ductility dip cracking which is\nexplained in DuPont et al. (2009). The phenomenon is caused by a significant drop in ductility at\ntemperatures between the solidus (Ts) and approximately half this value (0.5Ts). Although there\nare a number of theories that explain this drop in ductility, many are based on the theory\nsuggested by Rhines and Wray (1961) who stated that it was caused by grain boundary shearing.\nGiven that most precipitation hardened superalloys contain grain boundary carbides and tortuous\ngrain boundaries that prevent sliding, ductility dip cracking is rarely observed. The phenomenon is\nmore prevalent in solid solution strengthened superalloys, and is usually observed in the weld\nmetal.\nWheras most investigations use Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) for repair welding, some\nrecent articles by Egbewande et al. (2010), Idowu et al. (2007), Shinozaki et al. (2000) and Zhong et\nal. (2005) have demonstrated the advantage of laser welding. This process has a low heat input\nand the ability to control both the power and beam diameter independently. Electron beam\nwelding has similar advantages and has been investigated by Richards et al. (1994).\nMost analyses of liquation cracking in superalloys have focussed on the microstructure, with\nrelatively few studies on the effects of the process parameters. However, Egbewande et al.\n(2010), Shinozaki et al. (2000), Danis et al. (2010) and Richards et al. (1994) have investigated the\neffect of increasing welding speed at constant power. The results were inconclusive, with\nEgbewande et al. (2010) showing a slight reduction, Shinozaki et al. (2000) and Richards et al.\n(1994) showing an increase, and Danis et al. (2010) indicating that it had little effect. In addition,\nDanis et al. (2010) demonstrated that the effect of power was more significant than that of speed,\n6with less cracking being observed with lower power. However, this finding was contradicted by\nRichards et al. (1994), who found that increased power reduced cracking. Shinozaki et al. (2000)\nstated that when analysing cracking results it is important to consider the effect of the weld bead\nprofile which has a significant effect on the amount of cracking. This finding was supported by\nRichards et al. (1994) and Boucher et al. (1976) who found that greater aspect ratios (defined as\npenetration divided by the width) increased the amount of cracking.\nHence, the literature is divided over the effect of the process parameters on liquation cracking.\nPart of the confusion is due to the limited number of processing conditions investigated in these\nstudies. Therefore this paper describes an extensive investigation of the effect of the power,\nwelding speed, beam diameter and weld bead geometry on cracking in Rene 80 in the as-welded\nand PWHT conditions. For this purpose, partial penetration autogenous welds were studied and\nstatistical techniques similar to those reported in Pinkerton et al. (2008) and Vitanov et al. (2010)\nwere used to identify the parameters that had the greatest effect on cracking. It should be noted\nthat Sidhu et al. (2008) showed that cracking in autogenous welds is more severe than that in\nwire-added welds due to the harder and less ductile fusion zone in the former. Hence,\nautogenous welds may be considered the \u2018worst case\u2019.\n2 Experimental procedure\nAn IPG YLR-8000 high power fibre laser was used for the experimental work. This laser has a\nwavelength of 1070nm, and a maximum power output of 8 kW. The beam is delivered through an\noptical fibre to a Precitec YW50 process head with a collimating focal length of 125 mm and a\nbeam focal length of 250 mm. The process head is mounted on a Fanuc M-170iB\/45T robot.\n7The material used in this investigation was Rene 80, a precipitation hardened nickel-based\nsuperalloy. The welding trials were split into four sets, with the first set being performed on a\ndifferent batch of material to the other three. The two batches possessed similar compositions,\nwhich are shown in Table 1.\nTable 1 Chemical composition of the materials used in the trials (wt%)\nAl B C Co Cr Mo Ti W Zr S Fe Si Ni\nSet 1 3.02 0.011 0.15 8.80 14.2 4.1 4.83 3.70 0.02 <0.005 <1.0 <0.1 Bal\nSets 2, 3 & 4 3.05 0.011 0.16 8.96 14.1 3.99 4.87 3.81 0.01 <0.005 <1.0 <0.1 Bal\nThe material was investment cast into blocks with dimensions of approximately 220 x 70 x 22 mm.\nAfter casting, the material was hot isostatically pressed and solutionised. The blocks were then cut\nto samples of size 70 x 70 x 22 mm. Before welding, the plates were cleaned with a wire brush,\nand degreased with acetone.\nEach of the welds was 70 mm in length, and the parameter combinations used for three of the\nfour sets are shown in Table 2. For the first set, beam diameters of 0.7 and 1.71 mm were used,\nwhereas for sets 2 and 3 used beam diameters of 2.5 and 5 mm were used. Set 3 was performed\nat low power and welding speeds, which gave similar conditions to those experienced in manual\nrepair welds with arc based processes. In set 4, some select conditions were repeated from the\nfirst set, which was used to determine whether the material from the second batch was more or\nless susceptible to cracking than the first batch. The parameters for this set are shown in Table 3\nand are arranged in ascending order of heat input (power divided by welding speed). The beam\ndiameters were achieved by defocusing the beam to produce an energy density that was near\nGaussian, and resembled that of a typical repair weld using GTAW. The beam profile was\n8measured using a Primes GmbH Focus Monitor with Primes Laser Diagnostic Software 2.73. The\nbeam diameter is defined as the diameter that contains 86% of the beam energy. To protect the\nlaser from back reflection, the head was tilted 10\u00b0 to the plate surface.\nTable 2 Summary of the parameters used for the welding trials.

Kalling\u2019s waterless reagent (2g CuCl2, 40ml HCl and 80 ml methanol) was used to etch the\nsamples for up to 10 seconds to show good definition of the grain structure. A single section was\ntaken for all welding conditions except for the samples from set 4 and the corresponding samples\nfrom set 1 (for which the same parameters were used as for set 4). In these cases, five sections\nwere taken by measuring the cracks and then machining approximately 1.0 mm before\nremeasuring. This was repeated four times to give the five sections and the procedure enabled\nthe variability of cracking to be assessed. The samples were analysed using a Nikon Optiphot\nmicroscope with Carl Zeiss Axiovision software to measure the lengths of the cracks. Throughout\nthe analysis, the cracking was measured predominantly using the average crack length (ACL) per\nsection, which was chosen over the total crack length (TCL) because it is less dependent on the\nweld bead size.\nDesign Expert 7.1 was used to analyse the data and identify the statistically important factors.\nTwo types of model were used on both the as-welded and PWHT data. The first investigated the\neffect of power, beam diameter, and welding speed, whereas the second investigated the area of\nthe fusion zone and aspect ratio. The fusion zone area was chosen because it was indicative of the\n10\nabsorbed power per mm, and will be similar to the absorbed heat input. The aspect ratio is\ndefined as the penetration of the weld bead divided by the width. When analysing the data, the\nDesign Expert software used the following transformations of the ACL data:\n5008.7\n1\n'\n\uf02b\n\uf03d\nACL\ny (1a \u2013 as-welded results)\n53.26\n1\n'\n\uf02b\n\uf03d\nACL\ny (1b \u2013 PWHT results)\nThe functions are plotted in Fig. 1 and their effect was to compress the ACL data when it became\nlarge. Hence the statistical models indicated whether cracking was likely to occur or not rather\nthan the extent of the cracking.\nFinally an in-depth analysis of three samples was undertaken with a JEOL JSM-7000F Scanning\nElectron Microscope (SEM) equipped with an Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer. Semi-\nquantitative EDX was performed on the cracks observed in each of the samples. Note that it is\ndifficult to accurately determine the amount of carbon when using EDX analysis, due to\nunavoidable carbon contamination in the SEM vacuum chamber, so the carbon values presented\nin this document should be treated with caution, i.e. for qualitative comparison. However, the\nsignificant differentials of the carbon content detected are sufficient to identify the carbides in the\nmicrostructure. Where possible, the matrix has been measured for reference.\n11\nFig. 1 Plot of the inverse square-root transformations used for the as-welded and PWHT data. The\ntransformation compressed the ACL, making it possible to determine a statistical model to\nrepresent the cracking data.\n3 Results and Discussion\n3.1 As Welded Results\nA plot comparing the mean ACLs for the conditions used to check the two batches of material (see\nTable 2, set 4) is shown in Fig. 2. The mean was obtained from the five sections taken from each\nsample and the standard deviation is indicated with the error bars. The large standard deviation\nindicates the significant variability in the ACL. It is also interesting to note that the conditions that\ncaused cracking in one batch of material caused no or minimal cracking in the other.\n12\nOne of the samples had a very large ACL, which was the consequence of a solidification rather\nthan liquation crack (evidence for liquation cracking will be provided later). This particular sample\nhad a very large aspect ratio of 1.25 which is often associated with this type of cracking\nphenomenon (DuPont et al. (2009)). Note that no distinction is made between solidification and\nliquation cracking in the subsequent results and the few occurrences of solidification cracking\nwere always associated with high aspect ratio welds.\nOn first inspection, it might appear that the first batch was more sensitive to cracking than the\nsecond, however a statistical analysis of the results indicated a p-value of 9.95%. As stated in\nMontgomery (2009) a p-value close to one indicates that the null hypothesis is likely to be true, i.e.\nthe term does not have a significant effect on the output. In statistics a value of less than 5% is\nusually used to indicate that a factor is statistically significant. Therefore, the chance of the\nmaterial not being statistically significant is 9.95%, so it is unclear whether there was a difference\nbetween the two batches of material. All the subsequent plots show the combined results from all\nthe sets (excluding set 4), and checks were made to ensure that the trends indicated in the global\nplots were also reflected in the individual plots for particular sets.\n13\nFig. 2 Plot of the mean ACL vs. heat input for the repeat weld conditions used for the two batches\nof material. Note that the error bars indicate the standard deviation of the five readings.\nTable 4 shows the values of the coefficients of determination (R2), Adequate Precision, and p-\nvalues for the models presented in this paper, which are described in Montgomery (2009). Note\nthat the values of the coefficients of determination were particularly low because of the high\nvariability in the cracking data. i.e. the function was fit between points where cracking occurred\n(y\u2019 \u2248 0.05) and where it didn\u2019t (y\u2019 \u2248 0.37). Hence the distance from the function to these data\npoints was large giving a low value of R2. Nevertheless the model has been very useful in\nindicating regions where cracking was minimised. Adequate Precision is a measure of the signal to\nnoise ratio. Given that all the values were above four, this indicated that the model had a\nreasonable predictive ability. Finally the p-values were all less than 0.01% indicating that the\nmodels generated by the software were highly significant.\n14\nTable 4 Statistical data for the models presented in this paper.\nStatistical Test As-welded ACL\nvs. power, beam\ndiameter and\nwelding speed\n(Fig. 3)\nAs-welded ACL\nvs. aspect ratio\nand Log (fusion\nzone area) (Fig.\n4(b))\nPWHT ACL vs.\nwelding speed,\npower and beam\ndiameter.

The plot indicates that welding speed had\nlittle effect, whereas increasing power increased the likelihood of cracking when the beam\ndiameter was 2.85 mm. Note that when using the transformation shown in Fig. 1, a value of 0.365\ncorresponds to no cracking and values less than this indicate cracking is likely. Given that welding\nspeed had little effect on the incidence of cracking, a second plot that was independent of the\nwelding speed was created. This is shown in Fig. 3(b) and indicates the combined effect of power\nand beam diameter. The plot indicates that whereas increasing the power increased the incidence\nof cracking for beam diameters of 2.5 mm and below, the opposite effect was observed at the\nlargest beam diameter of 5 mm, i.e. cracking actually reduced with increasing power for this\ndiameter. In addition, this plot also suggests that the optimum beam diameter to reduce cracking\nis around 2.5 mm.\n15\nFig. 3 Effect of (a) power and welding speed (for a beam diameter of 2.85 mm), and (b) beam\ndiameter and power on the transformed ACL, for the as-welded samples. Note that a value of y\u2019 =\n0.365 corresponds to no cracking.\nThe empirical equation that was used to generate these results is given by:\n( + 7.5) . = 0.28\u2212 0.066 + 0.090 + 0.017 \u2212 0.022 (2)\nwhere\na\nb\n16\nP = power (kW);\nd = beam diameter (mm)\nFig. 4 Plot of the ACL for the as-welded samples vs. (a) aspect ratio and (b) fusion zone area and\naspect ratio. Note that a value of y\u2019 = 0.365 corresponds to no cracking.\nThe results in the previous plot suggested that the weld bead shape might be an important factor\nin predicting the likelihood of cracking. To understand this effect better, the ACL was plotted\na\nb\n17\nagainst the aspect ratio of the weld bead in Fig. 4(a). Although no cracking was observed (ACL = 0)\nacross the full range of aspect ratios, it was only consistently minimised in the region between\n0.25 and 0.65; i.e. the statistical nature of the cracking phenomenon means that consistent\nreduction in cracking is only observed in this region. In general, the welds with low aspect ratio\nthat showed cracking had the larger beam diameters (2.5 mm and especially 5 mm), whereas the\nconditions that showed more cracking with the large aspect ratios generally involved the smaller\nbeam diameters.\nTo understand how the fusion zone area affected the results, the Design Expert software was used\nto produce a plot of the combined effect of fusion zone area and aspect ratio, shown in Fig. 4(b).\nGiven that the data points are unevenly dispersed across the plot, they are indicated with red\ndots, and a log scale has been used for the fusion zone area. Note that caution must be used in\ninterpreting this plot, particularly in regions where there are few data points. The plot does\nhowever indicate that for very low aspect ratios (i.e. little penetration) cracking was only\nminimised when the fusion zone area was small. When the fusion area was greater, significant\ncracking could occur. As the aspect ratio was increased towards 0.5, the range in the fusion zone\narea where cracking was minimised was enlarged, and the plot indicates that even with large\nfusion zone areas cracking was low. Cracking increased again when the aspect ratio was increased\nbeyond 0.5. It is likely that the region that showed low cracking at high aspect ratios was a result\nof the statistical nature of the cracking phenomenon \u2013 there are only four data points in this\nregion. Finally, the plot indicates there was a limit in the fusion zone area below which no results\nwere obtained, which increased with the aspect ratio. Hence with the conditions used for the\nwelds it was not possible to obtain any conditions that had both a high aspect ratio and a small\nfusion zone area. This might be due to the threshold effects associated with the generation of a\n18\nkeyhole which was needed for the high aspect ratio weld conditions. i.e. a high aspect ratio\nrequires the generation of a keyhole, which was only possible at high power, which in turn\ngenerated a large fusion zone area.\n3.2 Post-weld Heat Treated Results\nAnalysis of the PWHT data with the statistical analysis software proved more difficult due to the\ngreater amount of cracking. Therefore, it was only possible to obtain a statistically significant\nmodel of the ACL vs. the welding parameters for the first data set. A plot of the transformed ACL\nvs. power and welding speed for the two beam diameters in set 1 is shown in Fig. 5. A slightly\ndifferent transformation was used this time, and a value of 0.194 corresponds to no cracking.\nThese plots suggest that welding speed did have an effect on cracking in the PWHT samples, with\nless cracking occurring as the welding speed increased. In addition, there was slightly lower\ncracking susceptibility with the smaller beam diameter data which can be seen by comparing the\nvalues in the two plots.\n19\nFig. 5 Plot of the ACL vs. power and welding speed for the PWHT samples from set 1 with beam\ndiameters of (a) 0.7 and (b) 1.7 mm. Note that a value of y\u2019 = 0.194 corresponds to no cracking.\nb\na\n20\nThe effect of the weld bead shape on the cracking was analysed and is shown in Fig. 6, which\nincludes data from all three sets. Fig. 6(a) shows a plot of the ACL against the aspect ratio, which\nindicates that cracking was consistently minimised when the aspect ratio was between 0.35 and\n0.65. Hence the effect of aspect ratio in the PWHT samples was similar to that in the as-welded\nsamples, except the region over which cracking was minimised was narrower. A statistical model\nshowing the effects of the aspect ratio and fusion zone area for all the data sets is shown in Fig.\n6(b). Although this plot indicates that cracking is minimised around intermediate aspect ratios, it\nalso suggests that minimising the fusion zone area is an important factor.\n21\nFig. 6 Plot of the ACL for the PWHT samples vs. (a) aspect ratio and (b) fusion zone area and aspect\nratio. Note that a value of y\u2019 = 0.194 corresponds to no cracking.\na\nb\n22\nFig. 7 (a) Pie chart showing the cracking behaviour in all the samples; and (b) HAZ size distribution\nfor the different cracking categories in (a).\n34%\n29%\n18%\n13%\n6%\nNot cracked - Not cracked\nNot cracked - Cracked\nCracked - Not cracked\nCracked - Cracked More\nCracked - Cracked less\nCracking\nAs welded :After PWHT\nCracking: As welded - After PWHT\n0.00%\n5.00%\n10.00%\n15.00%\n20.00%\n25.00%\n30.00%\n35.00%\n40.00%\n45.00%\n50.00%\n0-100 101-200 201-300 301-400 401-500 501-600 601-700 701-800 800+\nHAZ range (\u00b5m)\n%\no\nf\nsa\nm\np\nle\ns\nin\nca\nte\ng\no\nry\nAll samples No cracks - No cracks No cracks - Cracked\nCracked - No cracks Cracked - Cracked more Cracked - Cracked less\na\nb\nCracking:\nAs welded \u2013 After PWHT\n23\nThe final analysis in Fig. 7(a) compares the cracking before and after PWHT for all data sets. The\nsamples have been split into five categories, which are indicated in Fig. 7(a). In the bottom two\ncategories, cracking occurred in both the as-welded and PWHT conditions and a distinction is\nmade between those that cracked more after PWHT and those that cracked less after PWHT in\nterms of the total crack length. Across the whole data set, a third of samples showed no cracking\nin both the as-welded and PWHT conditions (category 1); a third showed no cracking in the as-\nwelded condition, but subsequently cracked during PWHT (category 2); and a third were cracked\nin the as-welded condition (category 3, 4 and 5). Note that some samples that were cracked\ninitially, subsequently showed no cracking after PWHT, which illustrates the statistical nature of\nthe cracking phenomenon. i.e. the incidence of cracking varied along the length of the sample.\nThe significant variability in cracking along a sample is demonstrated in Fig. 2.\nTo understand whether the size of the HAZ affected these results, the average HAZ size was\nmeasured optically for each sample by averaging its width on either side and underneath the\nfusion zone. These values were then used to plot a histogram showing the size distribution of the\nHAZ for the different cracking categories shown in Fig. 7(a), which is shown in Fig. 7(b). The results\nindicate that for those samples that showed no cracking in either the as-welded or PWHT\ncondition, the HAZ size was relatively small and was centred around 101-200 \u00b5m. The samples\nthat did not crack in the as-welded condition but cracked subsequently during PWHT also had a\nrelatively small HAZ zone size that was centred around 101-200 \u00b5m; however, in this category,\nthere were relatively more samples with the larger HAZ sizes. For the remaining samples where\ncracking was observed in the as-welded condition, the HAZ size was shifted towards larger values.\nHence the analysis shows the advantage of minimising the HAZ size to reduce cracking in both the\nas-welded and PWHT conditions.\n24\n3.3 Microstructure of the crack\nThree macrosections from three samples were selected for further analysis and are shown in Fig.\n8(a-c). These samples were selected to cover the full range of aspect ratios. Cracks were observed\nin all samples. The corresponding SEM images are shown in Fig. 8(d-f) and the results from the\nEDX analysis are shown in Table 5. Most of the cracks were intergranular and within the HAZ.\nRandom porosity was found in some of the welds, such as the one shown in Fig. 8(b). In samples\nthat had a high aspect ratio and a necked region similar to that shown in Fig. 8(b), the cracks were\ntypically found beside the necked region, under the main weld bead.\nThe EDX analysis of the low aspect ratio weld in Fig. 8(d) indicated that there was evidence of re-\nsolidified secondary phases (carbides) at the vertical edges of the crack, at the locations marked 1\nand 2. It could be argued that the carbides in points 1 and 2 are residual of an original carbide\nwhich existed before the weld, but during the weld partial melting of the carbide occurred,\nallowing some of the liquid to run into and re-solidify on the vertical crack face, visible at point 1.\nIn addition, the wide gap of the crack together with the irregular shape of the crack edge, confirm\nthat this was a liquation crack.\nThe crack shown in Fig. 8(e) had a wide, irregular and smooth edged morphology with evidence of\nre-solidified constituents in the crack indicating that the crack formed by liquation. The EDX\nanalysis showed the mixtures were re-solidified \u03b3\/\u03b3\u2019 eutectic (points 5-9), and mixture of re-\nsolidified carbide and \u03b3\/\u03b3\u2019 eutectic  (point 10) together with evidence of residual of an original bulk \n\u03b3\/\u03b3\u2019 matrix (point 12) and residuals of un-melted carbides (points 11, and 13). The final as-welded\ncrack shown in Fig. 8(f) showed further evidence in support of the liquation mechanism, due to the\nwide sections of the crack morphology, together with the appearance of re-solidified liquid in the\n25\ncrack. Additionally, the EDX analysis of the re-solidified constituents confirmed that the liquation\nof secondary phases (carbide and \u03b3\/\u03b3\u2019 eutectic) were the main cause of the liquation crack.  \nFinally, one of the PWHT cracks was analysed from a sample which used the same conditions as\nthe as-welded macro in Fig. 8(b). This crack is shown in Fig. 8(g) and two parts are observed: the\noriginal liquation crack which had similar morphology to that previously described (although the\nedges have been affected by the PWHT) at right-upper part of the image; and a much narrower,\ncontinuous crack with little evidence of any melting and re-solidification at left-lower part of the\nimage. Further details of the narrow crack are shown in Fig. 8(h), which shows fine crack voids\nthat were formed by stress in front of the tip of the crack. These features indicate the crack was\nstress induced, formed at relative low temperatures without the liquation reaction, and was\ntherefore likely to be caused by the PWHT cracking mechanism described in the introduction.\n26\na b c\nd e f\ng h\nFig. 8 Macrographs from as-welded samples: (a) low (0.11) aspect ratio (beam diameter = 5 mm, power = 2.5kW and welding speed = 2000\nmm.min-1); (b) high (0.83) aspect ratio (beam diameter = 0.7 mm, power = 2.6 kW and welding speed = 400 mm.min -1); and (c) optimal (0.55)\naspect ratio (beam diameter = 1.71 mm, power = 3.44 kW and welding speed = 2000 mm.min -1).

Ideally many\nmore samples at each condition should have been tested and the probability of\ncracking determined. Nevertheless, the number of samples analysed in this\npublication is an order of magnitude greater than that reported elsewhere. In\naddition, it has been possible to determine statistically significant models from the\ndata that was obtained. Throughout the study, it was clear that the microstructure\nwas a significant factor in influencing both forms of cracking. The grain size of the\nmaterial is large \u2013 typically 3.5 mm, hence the degree of segregation and the location\nof the grain boundary undoubtedly affect both cracking phenomena, and liquation\ncracking in particular. Hence the location of the grain boundaries relative to the fusion\nregion and HAZ was likely to be one of the main causes of the variability in cracking.\nThis variability could be clearly seen in the different cracking categories shown in Fig.\n7(a): in particular where cracking was observed in the as-welded condition, but not\nafter PWHT; and where the TCL after PWHT was smaller than before. The author\u2019s\nbelieve that this result, which initially appeared suspect, was due to the large\nvariability in the cracking that was observed in Fig. 2 and was potentially caused by the\nlarge grain size in the base material.\nAs noted in the introduction, there is contradictory evidence in the literature regarding\nthe effect of welding speed and power on the incidence of liquation cracking. The\ncurrent study found little effect of the welding speed, but a more significant effect of\n29\npower. It should be noted that although the published literature focussed on the\nmagnitude of cracking, this study has focussed on the incidence of cracking due to the\ntransformation function applied to the ACL data.\nThe effect of power depended on the beam diameter, as seen in Fig. 3(b). With small\nbeam diameters, increased power increased cracking, whereas with large beam\ndiameters increased power reduced cracking. This was largely a consequence of the\nweld bead geometry. As shown in Fig. 4, cracking in the as-welded condition (which\nwas predominantly liquation cracking) was minimised when the aspect ratio was\naround 0.5. Therefore, when small beam diameters were used with high powers,\ndeeply penetrating welds with large aspect ratios were produced that had a high\nincidence of cracking. Similarly low powers with the largest beam diameters caused\nlow aspect ratio welds which also had a higher incidence of cracking. In between these\ntwo extremes, it was found that a beam diameter of around 2.5 mm (Fig. 3(b)) reduced\nthe incidence of cracking in the as-welded condition. Interestingly, Zhong et al. (2005)\nreported an optimal beam diameter of 2 mm for laser deposition of IN 738, which is\nclose to the value reported in this study. This beam diameter avoided the extreme\naspect ratios that were obtained with either the smaller or larger beam diameters for\nthe range of powers investigated in this study.\nThe reasons for the significance of the aspect ratio are currently unclear. The aspect\nratio may have affected the stresses generated in the HAZ during cooling that caused\nliquation cracking (in addition to the liquation of grain-boundary phases). In addition,\n30\nthe high aspect ratio conditions also had a distinct neck around which liquation cracks\nwere often concentrated, as seen in Fig. 8(b). Shinozaki et al. (2000) also observed\nthat liquation cracks were associated with this feature. One explanation is the necked\nregion caused a concentration of stress in an unfavourable orientation, which in turn\ncaused cracking.\nAlthough the PWHT results also indicated a reduction in cracking around an aspect\nratio of 0.5, the range of aspect ratios over which it was reduced was smaller than for\nthe as welded condition. The most interesting aspect of these results was the greater\nimportance of the welding speed: increasing the welding speed reduced cracking in the\nfirst experimental set. One explanation is that increasing the welding speed typically\nreduces the size of the HAZ. This may alter the residual stresses within the HAZ and\nthe extent of hardening caused by the precipitation of \u03b3\u2019 due to the weld thermal\ncycle. This is partially supported by Fig. 7(b), which shows how samples that had a\nsmall HAZ were less likely to crack after PWHT than those with a large HAZ. An\nalternative explanation is that the shape of the fusion zone changes at the higher\nwelding speeds, giving lower aspect ratio welds, which were less susceptible to\ncracking for these beam diameters.\nFinally the microstructural analysis indicated that while some of the cracks were clearly\ncaused by liquation of carbides, for example those in Fig. 8(d), this was not true in all\ncases. Both Fig. 8(e & f) indicate substantial quantities of liquation occurred among\nbulk \u03b3\u2019, \u03b3\/\u03b3\u2019 euteuctic and MC carbides. In an analysis of cracking in a similar nickel \n31\nsuperalloy (IN 738) which was welded in the solutionised state, Ojo and Chaturvedi\n(2005) found that the \u03b3\u2019 particles reacted with the surrounding \u03b3 matrix forming a \neutectic type reaction which caused liquation of the grain boundaries. This mechanism\nis consistent with the EDX analysis of the liquated areas in Fig. 8 (e,f).\n5 Conclusions\nThis study on cracking in a nickel-based superalloy has shown that:\n1. The welding power significantly affected the incidence of cracking in the as-\nwelded condition, with low powers minimising cracking with a small beam\ndiameter and high powers minimising cracking with a large beam diameter. For\nthe range of powers used in this study, cracking in the as-welded condition was\nminimised when the beam diameter was around 2.5 mm.\n2. Cracking in the as-welded condition appeared to depend on the shape of the\nweld. In particular, the likelihood reduced when the aspect ratio was between\n0.25 and 0.65. A similar result was found with the PWHT samples, although the\nrange of aspect ratios over which cracking was minimised was reduced (0.35 to\n0.65). When the fusion zone area was included in the analysis, it was shown\nthat minimising the fusion zone area also helped to reduce the incidence of\ncracking in the as-welded and PWHT conditions.\n3. Increasing the welding speed had little effect on the incidence of cracking in the\nas-welded condition; however it was found to reduce cracking in the PWHT\ncondition in a subset of the samples.\n32\n4. An analysis that correlated the HAZ size to cracking showed that the samples\nthat had no cracking after welding or after PWHT had, on average, a smaller\nHAZ size than those samples in which cracking occurred.\n5. An analysis of the microstructure indicated cracking occurred due to the\nliquation of secondary phases during welding. These cracks were then\nobserved to extend during the subsequent PWHT via the PWHT cracking\nmechanism. Solidification cracks occurred in a few of the samples that had a\nhigh aspect ratio.\n6 Acknowledgements\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the financial support of Doncasters Group Plc, and\nthe assistance given by Philip Postans in undertaking this work.
