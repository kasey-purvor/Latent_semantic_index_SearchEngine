Our analysis suggests that certain policies, pursued as a result of decentralisation \nmay be associated with different educational outcomes, but it is not possible to draw \ndefinitive conclusions particularly in light of the differing political, policy and socio-\neconomic contexts. \nIntroduction \nThis paper addresses decentralisation in the field of education, focusing in particular on two \nEuropean countries, Germany and the UK.  Decentralisation is a concept with multiple \nmeanings and it is important to understand how it is being used in this paper.  We take as our \nstarting point three key ways in which decentralisation has been defined and measured: \nnamely fiscal, policy and political authority.  Fiscal decentralisation has been extensively \ninvestigated (e.g., Brennan and Buchanan 1980; Oates 1972, 1985; Tiebout 1956; Grossmann \nand West, 1994; Rodden, 2003) with research having found a positive impact of fiscal \ndecentralisation on education spending (Busemeyer, 2008; Nikolai, 2007).  Political and \npolicy decentralisation are rarely addressed in empirical research due to measurement \ndifficulties, but there is evidence that both are increasing (Rodden, 2004).   \nIn relation to education, Germany and the UK provide interesting cases as there is political \nand policy decentralisation to the region (Land) in the former and to constituent countries in \nthe latter.  There is also delegation of some responsibilities to school level in parts of the UK \nand Germany.  The variation in policies pursued at sub-national levels also provides an \nopportunity to investigate one key outcome variable, namely educational achievement within \ncountries.  This is particularly important as one of the reasons often given as an advantage of \ndecentralisation is that educational quality will improve.  The paper thus seeks to answer three \nkey research questions:  \n\uf0b7 What is the nature of political and policy decentralisation in the field of education in the \nUK and Germany?   \n\uf0b7 What education policies have been pursued in sub-national units (Laender and UK \nconstituent countries) and to what extent is there delegation to school level? \n \n2 \n\uf0b7 What effects, if any, on levels of attainment can be discerned as a result of policies \npursued by sub-national units? \nWe argue that decentralisation in the field of education is multifaceted and complex, with \ndifferent types of decentralisation co-existing.  It appears that some policies, pursued as a \nresult of decentralisation may be associated with different outcomes in relation to educational \nattainment.  However, different political, policy and socio-economic contexts do not allow for \ndefinitive conclusions. \nThe first section examines understandings of decentralisation, with particular reference to \neducation.  The claims for the beneficial effects of decentralisation or delegation of \nresponsibilities to school level on achievement are then explored.  The second section focuses \nspecifically on Germany and the UK.  In each case, the decentralisation of political authority \non the one hand, and legal, policy and administrative decentralisation on the other are \nexplored.  The possible relationships between policies implemented at sub-national levels and \neducational outcomes are then examined.  The final section discusses the findings.  \n1 Decentralisation  \nAcross the world in both federal and unitary states, devolution is apparent to varying degrees \n(Rodriguez-Pose and Gill, 2005).  The transfer of power downwards to regions is a highly \nsignificant recent development, which can involve the introduction of new political bodies at \na sub-national level and an increase in their power: \u2018Any form of devolution implies some \ndegree of sub-national legitimacy and some form of decentralisation of authority and \nresources\u2019 (Rodriguez-Pose and Gill, 2003, p.  334).   \nDevolution and federalism have similarities in that both refer to the decentralisation of \nauthority over certain policies, but there are important distinctions.  Federalism is a system in \nwhich there is a constitutionally entrenched division of authority between a central level and \nsub-national levels.  It has been conceptualised as \u2018an institutional device for the vertical \nseparation of powers, which splits jurisdiction along territorial lines\u2019 (Obinger et al, 2005, p.  \n9) and \u2018structured by a set of institutions \u2013 through which authority is distributed or \nredistributed\u2019 (Rodden, 2004, p.  489).  Federalism may be seen as being distinct from \ndecentralisation (see Dafflon and Madi\u00e8s, 2009) but this is not always the case.  Devolution \ndescribes a decentralisation process, which can take place in different types of state, including \nthose that are constitutionally unitary, which gives a greater degree of self-rule to sub-national \nunits.   \nWithin the European Union, some level of political decentralisation exists in Austria, \nGermany and Belgium (federal states) and Spain (Rodriguez-Pose and Gill, 2003).  The \nUnited Kingdom has also transferred power to the constituent countries, with a unitary state \nbeing replaced by a quasi-federal one (Bogdanor 1999; Jones et al, 2005).  There are different \nforms of devolution that arise from different distributions of legitimacy: \u2018Devolution is a \nhighly complex and heterogeneous process that operates at many different government levels, \ninvolves disparate actors and can take on a multitude of diverse forms\u2019 (Rodriguez-Pose and \nGill, 2005, p.  417).   \nOur interest in this paper is not only in the decentralisation of political authority but also in \ndecentralisation to lower levels, as a result of which particular policies may be pursued or \ncertain management and administrative responsibilities delegated.  In this context, it is \nimportant to stress that the rationale for decentralisation varies.  It can be to enhance service \ndelivery and improve standards in public services, to provide greater overall economic \nefficiency, or to provide greater legitimacy to government (see Rodriguez-Pose and Sandall, \n \n3 \n2008).  So, in the case of devolution, political legitimacy is likely to be important and in the \ncase of delegation to providers, enhanced service delivery may be part of the rationale. \nReasons for different types of decentralisation also vary.  In the 1980s, financial motives were \nof paramount concern in some countries: decentralisation was expected to reduce costs and to \ngenerate revenue by utilising local sources of taxation.  Recent decentralisation has been \nframed by a general paradigm shift in welfare policy, with moves towards the reorganisation \nof provision of services (Pollitt and Bouckaert, 2004) based on the ideas of New Public \nManagement characterised by state withdrawal, privatisation and localisation (see Hood, \n1991).  Delivery and financing have been decentralised in many areas: health care services, \nservices for older people (Fotaki and Boyd, 2005), public employment services (Jahn and \nOchel, 2007) and education (Hudson, 2007; Eurydice, 2007).  Such public service \ndecentralisation is regarded as providing more accountability and being more \u2018representative \nand conducive to policy innovations\u2019 (Rodriguez-Pose and Gill, 2005, p.  406). \nDecentralisation in education \nWithin the EU there are examples of political authority in the field of education being \ndecentralised to sub-national units in countries as diverse as Belgium, Germany, Spain and \nthe UK.  In terms of policies, there has been a trend towards increasing influence for local and \nregional governments in relation to control of the curriculum and the hiring and firing \nteachers (see Rodden, 2004).  There is, however, never complete decentralisation as decisions \nrelating to finances and personnel have varying degrees of centralisation (Zajda 2004; Bray \n1999; Hanson 1995).  Decentralisation to a local level may be to provide local control and so \na \u2018better fit between educational methods and clientele served, as well as greater \naccountability for educational results.  If the local education authorities see themselves and \nare seen as responsible for educational delivery, reformers reason, educational quality will \nimprove (Carnoy, 2000, p.  47).   \nThere has also been decentralisation of management and administration to the school level, \nassociated with the introduction of quasi-markets, competition, provider autonomy, school \nchoice, school evaluation and performance indicators (Wei\u00df 2001; Lubienski, 2007, 2006; \nAdnett and Davies, 2005; Finkelstein and Grubb, 2000; Koretz, 2008; Klitgaard 2007, 2008; \nWest and Currie, 2008).  Some responsibilities have been delegated to schools in Belgium, \nthe Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and England, Wales and Northern Ireland (Eurydice, 2007, \n2008b).  Decentralisation to this level has often been associated with seeking to make the \neducation system more efficient, responsive and accountable, the idea being that the \nredistribution of power to a school level will stimulate educational innovations designed to \nmeet the needs of pupils, parents and employers (see Maslowski et al., 2007; OECD, 2008; \nAstiz et al., 2002).   \nResearch in the field of education has tended to focus on decentralisation (or delegation) of \nresponsibilities to schools, so giving them autonomy in various domains.  Variation has been \nfound between countries in the extent to which school personnel report that decision making \nis taken at school level (see Figure 1).  More decisions are taken at school level in England \nthan in Germany or Scotland (91% versus 30% and 30%) (OECD, 2008).  However, such data \nmay not be an accurate reflection of policy; they also conceal the extent and type of \ncentralisation.  For this reason, our analysis of decentralisation in Germany and the UK \nfocuses not only on the type of decentralisation but also on the specificities of the policy \ndecentralisation and administrative delegation. \n \nFigure 1 about here \n \n4 \n \nResearch on school autonomy has tended to focus on achievement (which is seen as being a \nkey measure of quality).  Early research comparing public and private schools in the USA \n(Chubb and Moe 1990), which has since been contested (see Maslowski et al, 2007), found \nhigher levels of achievement in schools with more autonomy in relation to curricula, \nallocation of resources, teaching methods and staffing.  Research on the effects of school-\nbased management on achievement has had mixed results, although more recent studies have \nsuggested that the specific design is important for performance to be enhanced (Briggs and \nWohlstetter, 2003; Fullan and Watson, 2000; Leithwood and Jantzi, 2006; see Maslowski et \nal, 2007).  Another body of evidence uses achievement data derived from the Programme for \nInternational Student Assessment (PISA), which assesses 15 year old pupils\u2019 performance in \nreading, mathematical, and scientific literacy (OECD, 2001, 2007a, 2007b).   \nPositive associations between school autonomy (as reported by school personnel) and \nperformance in reading literacy have been found by the OECD (2005); however, no account \nwas taken of pupil background and school-level characteristics.  Subsequently, Maslowski et \nal (2007), focusing on four domains of school autonomy \u2013 personnel management, financial \nresources, pupil policies and curriculum \u2013 found that more autonomy in personnel \nmanagement was related to higher levels of reading literacy, but that this relationship \ndisappeared when school composition was taken into account.  Interestingly, positive effects \nof school autonomy on pupils\u2019 performance have been found provided that there are also \ncentralised examinations (W\u00f6\u00dfmann, 2002), which, it has been argued provide incentives to \nenhance pupils\u2019 performance and not to promote other interests (W\u00f6\u00dfmann and Fuchs, 2007; \nW\u00f6\u00dfmann, 2007, Fuchs and W\u00f6\u00dfmann, 2007; Gundlach and W\u00f6\u00dfmann, 2003).   \nWhilst previous research has focused on decentralisation to the school level and pupils\u2019 \nachievement \u2013 albeit with mixed and contested findings \u2013 there is a paucity of research that \nexplores both the possible effects of policies pursued as a result of decentralisation to sub-\nnational units and decentralisation associated with delegation of responsibilities to schools. \n2 Decentralisation and education in Germany and the UK \nWe focus here on Germany, a federal state and the UK, where a limited form of political \ndecentralisation (devolution) was introduced in 1998.  It is important to stress that in the UK \nthe devolved institutions are subordinate, constitutionally, to the UK parliament (Leeke et al, \n2003).  Our decision to focus on these two countries is related to the fact that in both cases \npower in relation to education is vested, to a greater or lesser extent, with sub-national units:  \nregions in Germany and constituent countries in the UK.  In addition, there is variation \nbetween the sub-national units in each country in terms of the educational policies pursued. \nThe first section examines the nature of decentralisation in Germany and the UK with respect \nto education.  The second section explores the variations in attainment levels within each case \nstudy country, and possible explanations for the differences observed, in particular policies \nassociated with decentralisation to sub-national units and delegation to schools. \nNature of decentralisation in Germany and the UK \nWe focus first on the nature of decentralisation in Germany and the UK, exploring political \nauthority along with policy, legislative and administrative decentralisation.  We then compare \nthe extent of decentralisation of responsibilities to school level in Germany and in the UK.   \n \n5 \nGermany \nPolitical authority: In federal states, education is generally reserved for each member state \nwithout direct federal control (Lauglo, 1995) and Germany is no exception.  Germany has a \nstrong tradition of regional government dating back to the founding of the German Empire in \n1871.  Since unification in 1990, the Federal Republic has consisted of 16 Laender: 10 of the \nformer West Germany, 5 new Laender of the former East Germany, and Berlin.  The \nGrundgesetz (Basic Law) divides the federal government\u2019s legislative responsibilities into \nexclusive powers, concurrent powers, and framework powers.  The field of education is \nwithin the legislative purview of the Laender.  Before the Basic Law was amended by the \nfederalism reform in 2006, the Federation and the Laender were able to cooperate, on the \nbasis of agreements, in educational planning and in the promotion of institutions and projects \nof scientific research of supra-regional importance.  The federalism reform of 2006 has been \nhighly significant.  The distribution between the federation and the Laender has changed and \nthere has been an almost complete withdrawal of the centre from education.  The 16 Laender \nnow have essential responsibility for education policy (see Burkhart, 2008; Wolf, 2008; Wolf \nand Henkes, 2007). \nThe German Constitution refers the regulation, planning, designing and supervision of the \nschool system to the parliaments of the Laender (Arbeitsgruppe Internationale \nVergleichsstudie, 2007), the main arenas of political decision making in relation to \neducational issues (R\u00fcrup, 2007).  In the past the parliaments of the Laender made abundant \nuse of their exclusive legislative competencies, so that the educational system of the Laender \ndiffer in the length of primary schooling, secondary school types and their pedagogical \norientations.  Although the primary responsibility for legislation and administration in \neducation, so-called cultural sovereignty (Kulturhoheit), rests with the Laender, one decisive \ninstitution ensures that the development of the education systems in the Laender follow a \nsimilar direction: since 1948 the Conference of the Laender Ministers of Education and \nCultural Affairs (Kultusministerkonferenz, KMK) has coordinated and harmonised education \npolicy. \nPolicy, legislative and administrative decentralisation: Due to Laender sovereignty in the \nfield of education, the German school system has a high level of decentralisation at the level \nof the individual Land.  The public school administration at Laender level supervises the \nimplementation of the school acts and the administration of schools.  Internal school matters \nrest with the Laender, with external school matters such as building and maintenance and the \nappointment and remuneration of non-teaching staff being the responsibility of local \nauthorities.  The autonomy of individual schools is relatively low (Senkbeil et al, 2004).  \nNevertheless, in some Laender individual schools have gained more autonomy (R\u00fcrup, 2007), \nalthough without demanding accountability, setting performance standards or introducing \nsystematic quality inspections. \nEven though the legislative power in relation to education is exclusively in the hands of the \nLaender there is a need for coordination, for example for mutual recognition of graduation \ncertificates, for standardising the beginning and the duration of compulsory education and for \na standardised grading system.  According to the constitution, the \u2018unitary federal republic\u2019 of \nGermany (Lehmbruch, 2000) is a nationwide unitary legal and economic unit with equal \nliving conditions, so that there is a need for cooperation and consensus in nearly all fields of \npolitics.   \nThe KMK is highly significant in this context and provides an example of the joint decision \ntrap described by Scharpf et al.  (1976) given the strong entanglement of the federal \ngovernment and the states in Germany.  Although it is possible for individual Laender (and \n \n6 \nbefore the reform of federalism, the federal government) to act unilaterally, in practice it is \npolitically difficult to enforce given the high degree of entanglement and standardisation \ncharacteristics for German federalism.  Thus, given the regulations in place in relation to \nstandards, it has been argued that the new legislative changes are only marginal in character \n(Burkhart, 2008) and that policies will be coordinated across all 16 Laender. \nNotwithstanding the possible limitations of the reform, one element of the institutional \neducational structure that has remained untouched is the secondary school system.  Pupils are \ngenerally selected at the age of 10 to 12 years into different types of school (between two and \nfive); only one of these, the Gymnasium, paves the way to university\n1\n by awarding a \ndistinctive, high-value leaving school certificate, the Abitur.  There are two other types of \nschool, the Hauptschule (for the lowest ranking pupils) and the Realschule (for middle \nranking pupils).  In addition, a small proportion of pupils attend the comprehensive \nGesamtschule, catering for all ability levels. \nWith German reunification, the West German stratified secondary school system was adopted.  \nThe reorganisation in the new Laender also resulted in an expansion of the institutional \nvariety: in some Laender there are three school types (Gymnasium, Hauptschule, Realschule), \nin others two (Gymnasium and Hauptschule\/Realschule combined), and in others five.  Most \nLaender are, however, changing their school system and bringing together the Hauptschule \nand Realschule (Baumert et al., 2008; Fuchs 2009). \nThere is an ongoing debate about the evaluation of  educational institutions.  The focus has \nbeen to secure comparability between the Laender by introducing nationally formulated \nstandards and centralised final examinations including the Zentralabitur (the general \nqualification for university entrance) (F\u00fcssel and Leschinsky 2008).  Although Bavaria, \nBaden-Wurttemberg and Saarland have always had a centralised system, after 2000, partly as \na result of the PISA studies (see below), there was a nationwide move to introduce a \ncentralised Abitur examination at the end of the Gymnasium.  Of the 16 Laender, only \nRhineland-Palatinate has retained decentralised examinations set at school level (KMK 2009).  \nIn 2002, the KMK adopted a resolution to introduce national Bildungsstandards (educational \nstandards).  In 2003 and 2004, educational standards were also adopted for the primary sector, \nthe school-leaving qualification for the Hauptschule and the intermediate school leaving \ncertificate (Mittlerer Schulabschluss). \nUnited Kingdom \nPolitical authority: Devolution in the United Kingdom was enacted by the Labour \ngovernment in late 1990s, and Scotland now has an elected parliament with primary \nlegislative responsibility over much domestic policy, Northern Ireland has an elected power-\nsharing responsibility which also has wide ranging legislative competence and Wales has an \nelected assembly with no primary legislative responsibilities (Shaw et al., 2009). \nThe recent history of the education systems of the four countries of the UK (England, \nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) has been addressed elsewhere (Raffe et al., 1999).  Of \nsignificance in this context is that by 1994, prior to political devolution, for most fields of \neducation, the Department for Education and Employment was responsible for England and \nrelevant \u2018territorial\u2019 departments for Scotland (Scottish Office), Wales (Welsh Office) and \nNorthern Ireland (Department of Education Northern Ireland) (see Raffe et al., 1999). \nIncreased political authority followed from 1999 when the Scottish Parliament, the National \nAssembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly assumed executive and (in Scotland \nand Northern Ireland) legislative responsibility for education.  This has resulted in different \n \n7 \nlevels of responsibility in the constituent countries of the UK.  Scotland has a parliament and \nexecutive (the Scottish Government): the former can pass Acts and the latter can make \nsecondary legislation in areas other than those made at a UK level.  In Wales, there is a Welsh \nAssembly but no separate executive and legislature.  The Assembly can make delegated or \nsecondary legislation in devolved areas (of which education is one) but primary legislation in \ndevolved areas is made by the UK parliament.  The situation in Northern Ireland is complex, \nbut the Assembly can make primary and delegated legislation in those areas that are \ntransferred (Leeke et al, 2003).   \nLegislative, policy and administrative decentralisation: The local administration of schools \nvaries across the UK.  In England, Scotland and Wales schools are administered by local \nauthorities and those in Northern Ireland by education and library boards (see Raffe et al., \n1999).  The role of the local authority also varies between countries, with Scottish local \nauthorities having more power and responsibility than those in England, largely as a result of \nneo-liberal, quasi-market reforms in England (see below).   \nThe state-maintained school systems in the UK vary.  England and Wales have a similar \nlegislative framework, that for Northern Ireland is broadly similar, whilst that for Scotland is \ncompletely separate.  Nonetheless, across the UK, primary schools cater for children of all \nabilities.  At secondary level, systems and structures differ.  In Scotland and Wales there is a \ncomprehensive (all ability) system.  In England, the system is broadly comprehensive, \nalthough around 5 per cent of secondary schools are academically selective grammar schools.  \nIn addition, a significant minority of nominally comprehensive schools, predominantly those \nthat control their own admissions,\n2\n use a variety of different methods that enable a proportion \nof pupils to be selected, for example on the basis of aptitude\/ability in a subject area (West et \nal., 2009); and virtually all state-funded religious schools give priority to children on the basis \nof their religion (see Allen and West, 2009).  In Northern Ireland, there is an academically \nselective system, with grammar schools and secondary (non-selective) schools. \nThe legislative and policy context is important. In England and Wales, the Education Act \n1980 enabled parents to express a preference for the school of their choice for their child.\n3\n  \nThe Education Reform Act 1988 introduced formula funding, whereby individual school \nbudgets were determined predominantly on the basis of the number of pupils on roll.  Official \nschool performance tables (\u2018league tables\u2019) of public examination results were also published.  \nIncentives were thus created for schools to maximise their income and their pupils\u2019 \nexamination results via the newly created quasi-market (Le Grand and Bartlett, 1993).  \nUnderpinning the reforms was the view that parents would choose the \u2018best\u2019 schools for their \nchild, based on the information available, in particular, examination results, and that the \nensuing competition between schools would result in educational standards increasing.  Local \nmanagement of schools was also introduced in England and Wales and schools (headteachers \nand governing bodies) became responsible for deciding how the school budget should be \nspent.  The same legislation introduced a national curriculum and programme of assessment \nin England and Wales.\n4\n   \nIn Scotland, the Education (Scotland) Act 1981 gave parents the right to nominate a school \nthey wished their child to attend (make a \u2018placing request\u2019) if they wanted him or her to attend \na school other than the local school.  In relation to funding, local authorities decide on the \nlevel of support to be given to schools.  Individual schools are responsible for managing their \nown day-to-day expenditure via devolved school management, but unlike in England, the \nschool\u2019s \u2018normal complement\u2019 of staff is paid by the local authority (Eurydice, 2008a).  There \nare non-statutory curriculum guidelines\n5\n and a non-statutory testing programme.   \n \n \n8 \nAcross the UK there are external examinations at the end of compulsory education (age 16) \nand at the end of upper secondary education (age 18).  In England, Wales and Northern \nIreland, these examinations are run by private examination boards that compete with one \nanother for business.\n6\n  In Scotland there is a central examination system with examinations \nbeing set by a central examination board.\n7\n \nThere are thus policy differences across the UK.  And since devolution other aspects of policy \nin relation to choice and diversity have diverged: in particular official school performance \ntables are not published in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.  Differences between \nEngland and Scotland are particularly clear: thus, there is considerable involvement of the \nprivate sector in the school system in England whilst in Scotland approaches to provision are \nmore traditional with a greater focus on professional values as opposed to choice and diversity \n(Shaw et al., 2009; West and Currie, 2008).   \nAdministrative decentralisation to school level in Germany and the UK \nIt is clear from our discussion that education policies and systems differ within sub-national \nunits in both Germany and the UK.  In both countries education is decentralised along a range \nof different dimensions.  In particular, policies vary in terms of academic selection.  In \nGermany and in Northern Ireland the school system is selective.  In England there are some \nfully and some partially academically selective schools alongside comprehensive schools.  In \nScotland and Wales there is no academic selection. \nThere are also a number of other differences between and within sub-national units in relation \nto the responsibilities delegated to school level, as reported by EU Member States (Eurydice, \n2007, 2008b).\n8\n   \n \nTable 1 about here \n \nTable 1 focuses on Germany and the two most distinctive countries in the UK in terms of \neducation policy, England and Scotland.  As can be seen, there is considerable variation: in \nrelation to resourcing and staffing, delegation to school level is more extensive in England \nthan in Scotland and Germany.  In all countries there is some autonomy in relation to a \nnumber of aspects of the curriculum.   \nGiven the focus given to decentralisation and attainment in the literature, we now turn to our \ntwo case study countries and examine differences between and within them. \nVariation in achievement levels: Germany and the UK    \nThe OECD\u2019s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), first administered in \n2000, covers three domains: reading, mathematical and scientific literacy.  It provides \ninformation on the knowledge and skills of 15 year old pupils in these areas.\n9\n It does not focus \non curricular competences but on everyday knowledge and skills that young people will need \nwhen they enter post-secondary education and the labour market.  The overall findings from \nPISA over the years have revealed differences in levels of achievement in participating \ncountries, in different domains and along different dimensions including gender and socio-\neconomic status (e.g., OECD, 2001, 2007).   \nOur focus in this paper is on the PISA data for 2006 and as shown in Table 2 few differences \nin mean performance between Germany and the UK were found. \n \n \n9 \nTable 2 about here \n \nOur interest in this paper is with variations within countries.  In the following sections, we \nbuild on the work of Allmendinger and Leibfried (2003) and associate indicators of \u2018quality\u2019 \nwith measures of the level of \u2018dispersion\u2019.  At a given mean, which can serve as an indicator \nof quality, the dispersion is used to indicate the inequality of the result.  In this way we can \nclassify both individual German Laender and constituent countries of the UK in terms of their \nquality and inequality.  The typology we use is based on a cross-classification of level and \ndifferentiation and yields four types: egalitarian, high-competence; unequal, high-\ncompetence; egalitarian low-competence and unequal, low-competence. \nGermany \nIn addition to the international PISA comparisons, the competences of 15 year old pupils in \nGerman Laender have been assessed via a national extension study (PISA-E) and it is these \ndata that we draw on in this section.  Table 3 reveals that the highest attainment across all \ndomains (mathematical literacy, reading literacy and scientific literacy) was in Saxony \nfollowed by Bavaria.   \n \nTable 3 about here \n \nGiven that the focus of PISA 2006 was on mathematical literacy, we now explore in more detail \nthe differences in terms of competence and differentiation between Laender (the results for \nother domains are broadly comparable). \nTable 4 shows the different quadrants into which different Laender fall: Saxony is illustrative of \nan egalitarian, high-competence system; Hessen of an unequal, low-competence system; \nRhineland-Palatinate of an egalitarian, low-competence system.  The dimensions we have \nproposed are related to a key problem: the association between poor educational outcomes and \nlow social background.  The Laender with a more egalitarian and high-competence producing \nschool system, tend to be the ones with a comparatively weaker link between social origin and \nscores in tests of competence (PISA-Konsortium Deutschland 2008).  In other education \nsystems such as in Bremen, Rhineland-Palatinate and Schleswig-Holstein the link between the \nsocial background of pupils and their competence is much stronger.  In the group of more \negalitarian and high-competence producing systems we find education systems with two types \nof secondary school (Gymnasium and Realschule\/Hauptschule) in Saxony and Thuringia and \nthree types (Gymnasium, Realschule and Hauptschule) in Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg.  \nDifferences between the Laender in relation to the number of school types do not seem to \nprovide a clear explanation for their higher performance.  These Laender also differ \nsignificantly in terms of socio-demographic variables such as pupils\u2019 socio-economic \nbackground, migration background and child poverty rates.   \n  \nTable 4 about here \n \nGiven that there are no clear-cut policy differences between Laender that might account for \nthe variation, the question arises as whether delegation of particular responsibilities to the \nschool level might account for differences observed.  To explore this issue, it was possible to \n \n10 \nuse data from the German supplementary sample of PISA (PISA-E) carried out in 2003 were \nanalysed.  Headteachers\u2019 reports of school autonomy were utilised (these are not comparable \nwith the data in Table 1 which relate to officially reported policies).  Autonomy in personnel \nmanagement was found to be low (6%) as was autonomy in formulating the school budget \n(10%).  However, autonomy to deciding on budget allocations within the school was very \nhigh (94%) as was autonomy in terms of student policies (86%), with curricular autonomy \nbeing lower (68%) (see Annex A, Table A1). \nMultivariate analyses using data arising from PISA 2003 were carried out (see Annex A, \nTable A2) to explore the variables associated with attainment.\n10\n  Our interest is in \nadministrative decentralisation to school level which varies between Laender.  Having \ncontrolled for background factors and school structural factors (models 1 and 2), model 3 \nanalyses the effects of autonomy.  Schools with autonomy over personnel management had \nhigher mean mathematical literacy scores than those without.  In relation to autonomy in \nformulating the school budget and student policies there were no statistically significant \nassociations.  Schools which reported autonomy over the curriculum had lower mean student \nmathematical literacy scores than schools without; these results may however be explained by \nthe fact that it was not possible to control for central examinations which have only recently \nbeen introduced. \nUK \nAlthough the UK has participated in each round of PISA, it participated as one country in  \n2000.  In 2003, the results for the UK were deemed unreliable as England did not achieve the \nrequired response rate even though Scotland did.  In 2006, Scotland and England took part \nseparately but as part of the UK (Grek et al., 2009). \nTable 5 reveals that there were relatively few statistically significant differences between \ncountries for mathematical literacy.  The highest attainment was in Scotland which was \nsignificantly higher than that for Northern Ireland.  Wales was significantly lower than \nEngland.  For reading literacy, Wales was significantly lower than the other countries for \nreading.  In relation to overall scientific achievement the mean scores in England, Wales, \nNorthern Ireland and Scotland are similar, although England\u2019s mean score was higher than \nthat for Wales (Bradshaw et al.  2007).   \n \nTable 5 about here \nAs the focus of PISA 2006 was on mathematical literacy, we now explore in more detail the \ndifferences in terms of competence and differentiation between constituent countries of the UK \n(the results for other domains are broadly comparable). \n \nTable 6 about here \nTable 6 shows the different quadrants into which different countries fall:  Scotland is \nillustrative of an egalitarian, high-competence system; Northern Ireland is illustrative of an \nunequal, low-competence system; and Wales of an egalitarian low competence system.  The \nquestion arises as to why these differences exist.  The countries do vary in terms of the \ncharacteristics of their population.\n11\n  In particular, more children live in the poorest \nhouseholds (the bottom quintile in terms of household income) in Wales (29%) than in \nNorthern Ireland (27%) England (25%) or Scotland (24%) (DWP 2008). Given the strong \n \n11 \nlinks between poverty and low attainment, this may help account for the lower mean \nperformance of Wales.   \nMoreover, there are differences between the countries of the UK in terms of the policies that \nhave been pursued.  This is most clearly exemplified if England and Scotland are compared: \nthere is much more delegation of responsibilities to school level in the former than the latter \nand although their mean performance is similar, the results are more dispersed.  This suggests \nthat policies other than those related to delegation of responsibility to the school level may \nhelp us understand the differences observed.  One plausible policy relates to policies relating \nto secondary school selection. Previous research involving the analysis of attainment data in \npublic examinations at the age of 16, reveals that in Scotland levels of inequality have shown \na relative tendency to become narrower over time whilst in England they have not (Raffe et \nal., 2006).  This may be a reflection of \u2018schools\u2019 stronger comprehensive ethos and their lower \nsocial segregation\u2019 (p. 10).  This is  because social segregation is associated with lower levels \nof later attainment as school composition has an impact on attainment of all pupils at the \nschool (see Croxford, 2009).  Analyses of PISA data have also found that schools in Scotland \nare less socially segregated than in England (Jenkins et al., 2007) and that there are more \ninequalities in achievement where there is an academically selective education system (Alegre \nand Ferrer, 2009).  Segregation levels are also higher where more pupils attend schools with \nautonomy over admissions (Alegre and Ferrer, 2009) and this is the case with a third of \nEnglish secondary schools (West et al., 2009).   \n3 Discussion and conclusion \nThis paper set out to examine the nature of political authority and policy decentralisation in \nthe field of education the UK and Germany; the education policies pursued by national sub-\nunits; the extent of delegation to school level; and the association between different policies \npursued at sub-national levels and attainment.   \nIn Germany, political authority for school-based education is vested with the regions \n(Laender), and in the UK it is vested to a greater or lesser extent with the constituent \ncountries.  In both cases, there has been an increase in political authority at sub-national \nlevels.   \nThe education policies pursued in Germany and the UK vary across sub-national units.  In the \nUK, there are some clear differences between the constituent countries; this is particularly \nclear if we focus on the two most distinctive countries, England and Scotland.  In Scotland, \nthere is no selection by ability to secondary schools, whilst in England there are policies that \nenable pupil selectivity.  In Scotland, there is relatively little administrative and management \nresponsibility vested with individual schools whereas in England, there is considerable \ndelegation to school level associated with the introduction of a quasi-market in school-based \neducation.  Turning to Germany, there is academic selection across the country although the \nnumber and types of schools vary between Laender.  In a significant proportion of schools, \ncertain responsibilities are delegated to school level.   \nA major debate in the literature has been on the extent to which policies which result in power \nbeing delegated to schools are associated with higher educational standards.  We used the \nresults of PISA 2006 to compare the mean performance and dispersion across sub-national \nunits in Germany and the UK.  Achievement levels were similar in Germany and the UK in \nterms of overall mean performance in PISA 2006.  Within each country, we found differences \nin terms of the indicators of quality and measures of the level of dispersion.  Some of the \ndifferences observed are the result of pupil characteristics (socio-demographic variables such \n \n12 \nas poverty and socio-economic background), but there are indications that policies \nimplemented at sub-national levels may also be significant. \nUsing data from the German extension study of PISA 2003, it was found that some \nresponsibilities delegated to school level were associated with higher mean scores in \nmathematical literacy.  In particular, in those schools where the headteacher reported \nautonomy over personnel management, scores were higher; this might be because such \nschools are able to utilise their teaching staff and teaching methods to meet the specific needs \nof the pupils in the school.  Interestingly, schools reporting autonomy over the curriculum had \nlower mean scores than schools without: this finding may be explained by the fact that it was \nnot possible to control for centralised examinations, which were only introduced in 2002.   \nIn the UK, the mean performance scores for the constituent countries varied to some extent.  \nHowever, when the two countries with the most diverse systems, England and Scotland, were \ncompared, it was found that mean scores were similar, but that dispersion was greater in \nEngland.  We postulate that the reasons for this dispersion may be related to the school \nsystem in place in Scotland which is fully comprehensive, unlike that in England where \npolicies allowing for various types of school selection have been pursued. \nOur analysis confirms the view that decentralisation is multifaceted and complex.  We have \nextended previous research by exploring different types of decentralisation in the field of \neducation and found that policies pursued as a result of decentralisation differ and may be \nassociated with differing educational outcomes.  Although much of the debate in relation to \ndecentralisation in education has focused on the delegation of management and administration \nto schools, more attention could be given to the relationship between sub-national policies and \noutcomes; of particular interest are those relating to pupil selection, admissions and \nassessment.  Given the evidence relating socio-economic background to achievement, it is \nimportant to know this interacts with policies pursued, in order to provide further insights into \nthe possible consequences of different types of decentralisation on pupils\u2019 educational \noutcomes and how these might be optimised. \nReferences \n \nAdnett N, Davies P, 2005, \u201cSchooling reforms in England: from quasi-markets to co-\nopetition?\u201d Journal of Education Policy 18 393 \u2013 406 \nAlegre, M A, Ferrer, G, 2009, \u201cSchool regimes and education equity: some insights based on \nPISA 2006\u201d, British Educational Research Journal, iFirst Article, first published 17 \nJune 2009.   \nAllen R, West A, 2009, Religious Schools in London: School Admissions, Religious \nComposition and Selectivity, Oxford Review of Education 35(4), 471-494. \nAllmendinger J, Leibfried S, 2003, \u201cEducation and the Welfare State: The Four Worlds of \nCompetence Production\u201d Journal of European Social Policy 13 63 \u2013 81 \nArbeitsgruppe Internationale Vergleichsstudie, 2007 Schulleistungen und Steuerung des \nSchulsystems im Bundesstaat.

In Scotland, the Scottish Certificate of Education \nexaminations Standard Grade (16 years); Higher Grade\/Advanced Higher Grade examinations (18 \nyears) (generally required for entry to higher education). \n8\n These are, in our view, likely to be more accurate in terms of the formal position than those provided \nby the OECD via individual headteachers, given the scope for the questions posed to be interpreted \ndifferently.   \n9\n Data relating to school autonomy can be derived from the school level questionnaire in the PISA \nstudies, which are completed by the head teacher of the participating schools.  Questions relate to their \nautonomy in the fields of personnel management, financial resources, pupil policies and curriculum. \n10\n The individual data for the German Laender for 2006 were not available.   \n11\n The proportion of non-white residents in the UK varies (9% in England, 2% in Wales and Scotland, \n1% in Northern Ireland ((ONS 2009; NISRA 2002; SCROL 2009)); there are differences in \nperformance between pupils from different ethnic groups, (DfES 2006) but more of the variance in \nachievement is accounted for by deprivation than ethnicity (DfES, 2006). \n"}
