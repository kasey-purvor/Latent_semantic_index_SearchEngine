Sb added as Sb acetate \neither directly to the reaction (a), or dissolved in ethylene glycol first (b). The \nproportion of Sb added is shown. 0.1 at.% in a) and 5 at.% in b) are omitted because \nlarge amounts of dispersion in these samples meant that absorption peaks could not be \nresolved. In both sets of data there appears to be a blue shift in the absorption peak \nwith increasing Sb content. There are many possible explanations for this including \nwidening of the band gap, changes in morphology and many others. Further work is \nrequired to ascertain the cause of this shift. \n \nSupplementary Material (ESI) for Chemical Communications\nThis journal is (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry 2009\n"}
