INTRODUCTION\nIt has been shown that the results of measurements\nbased on the interaural cross-correlation coefficient ~IACC!\ncan be used to predict a number of aspects of binaural per-\nception. Whereas recent research has suggested that it is not\nan accurate representation of the physiology of the binaural\nhearing process ~Brand et al., 2002!, the predictions of mod-\nels of binaural perception based on the IACC have shown\nremarkable similarity to experimental data relating to later-\nalization ~e.g., Sayers, 1964; Okano, 2000; Constan and\nHartmann, 2001!, binaural detection thresholds ~e.g., Sayers\nand Cherry, 1957; Robinson and Jeffress, 1963; Bernstein\nand Trahiotis, 1992!, and the perceived source width of an\nauditory stimulus ~e.g., Chernyak and Dubrovsky, 1968;\nPlenge, 1972; Kurozumi and Ohgushi, 1983; Blauert and\nLindemann, 1986!.\nThe relationship between the IACC and binaural detec-\ntion thresholds has been researched in detail, and the major-\nity of relevant fundamental factors such as frequency depen-\ndency ~e.g., Bernstein and Trahiotis, 1996b!, and temporal\nresolution ~e.g., Culling and Summerfield, 1998!, have been\ninvestigated in a controlled manner. The relationship be-\ntween the IACC and perceived auditory source width, how-\never, has not been investigated in as much detail. The aim of\nthis paper is to investigate the frequency dependency of the\nrelationship between the IACC of an auditory stimulus and\nthe perceived auditory source width of that stimulus, and to\nmodel this dependency such that it can be incorporated in an\nauditory source width measure.\nIn the late 1960s, Chernyak and Dubrovsky ~1968!\na!Electronic mail: r.mason@surrey.ac.ukJ. Acoust. Soc. Am. 117 (3), Pt. 1, March 2005 0001-4966\/2005\/117(3)\/1showed that there was a negative relationship between the\nIACC and the perceived auditory source width of noise\nstimuli that were presented over headphones. This relation-\nship was also found by Keet ~1968!, who used musical sig-\nnals that were reproduced over loudspeakers. This inverse\nrelationship between the IACC and the perceived auditory\nsource width has been confirmed by other investigations us-\ning a range of stimuli ~Kurozumi and Ohgushi, 1983;\nMorimoto et al., 1993!. From this, a number of researchers\nhave developed models, based on the IACC, to predict the\nperceived source width of auditory stimuli for sound repro-\nduction ~e.g., Sakai et al., 1980; Tohyama and Suzuki, 1989!\nand auditorium acoustics ~e.g., Ando, 1985; Morimoto and\nIida, 1995; Hidaka et al., 1995!. This research has resulted in\nmodels that match perception reasonably well, and has led to\nthe standardization of some methods ~ISO 3382, 1997!.\nHowever, in spite of the growing popularity of these models,\nthere are arguments against their practicality ~e.g.,\nGriesinger, 1997; de Vries et al., 2001!, and there are also a\nnumber of fundamental factors that have not yet been fully\naddressed in a controlled manner.\nOne such factor is the effect of audio frequency on the\nrelationship between the IACC and the perceived source\nwidth of an auditory stimulus. Investigations by a number of\nresearchers have indicated the existence of this effect ~e.g.,\nPerrott et al., 1980; Blauert and Lindemann, 1986; Yanagawa\net al., 1990!, but methods to model it have not yet been\nderived.\nThe experiments that are reported in this paper investi-\ngate the frequency dependency of the relationship between\nthe IACC and perceived auditory source width in detail, with\nthe aim to identify and model the separate contributory com-\nponents, in order to develop an objective auditory source1337337\/14\/$22.50 \u00a9 2005 Acoustical Society of America\nFIG. 1. Relationship between the gain value, G, and the\nresulting IACC for stimuli created using the method\ndescribed in Eqs. ~1!\u2013~4!.width measure that is suitable for a wide range of stimulus\ntypes. Additionally, it is expected that the research reported\nin this paper will lead to the inclusion of an IACC-based\nauditory source width model in a more complete binaural\nhearing model, similar to that proposed by Morimoto et al.\n~1995!. The experiments reported herein all employ continu-\nous narrow-band stimuli, and it is acknowledged that further\nwork may be required to adjust the resulting model for use\nwith stimuli that are more externally valid. Detailed informa-\ntion on the IACC-based calculations used in this paper is\ncontained in the Appendix.\nII. METHOD\nA. Stimuli\nIn order to undertake the experiment in a controlled\nmanner and limit extraneous variables as much as possible,\nstimuli with specific characteristics were required. A detailed\ndiscussion of the requirements of the stimuli for the experi-\nments that are described in this paper is provided by Mason\net al. ~2003!; the pertinent information is summarized here.\nFirst, testing of frequency dependence requires stimuli with a\nnarrow bandwidth\u2014ideally within a single critical band, i.e.,\napproximately 35 Hz at low frequencies and widening with\nincreasing center frequency ~Glasberg and Moore, 1990!.\nSecond, accurate mapping of a perceived effect to a given\nmeasured value requires stimuli that are time invariant in\nterms of that metric. As any measurement of time invariance\nis dependent on the temporal resolution of that measurement,\nthe optimum integration window needs to be determined.\nPrevious studies into the perception of temporal variations in\nIACC have suggested that this can be modeled by a time\nconstant of between 35 and 243 ms, depending on the ex-\nperiment setup and the individual subject ~Grantham and\nWightman, 1979; Boehnke et al., 2002!. For these experi-\nments the shortest integration time ~therefore the most criti-\ncal value resulting from the most sensitive subjects! from\nprevious studies was used, namely 35 ms. Finally, to be able1338 J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 117, No. 3, Pt. 1, March 2005to examine the effect of frequency dependency at a wide\nrange of values of IACC requires stimuli whose IACC can\nbe varied in small steps across the entire range of values\nwhile minimizing any other perceivable variations.\nPrevious experiments that investigated relationships be-\ntween the IACC and perceived auditory source width used a\nwide range of stimuli, including music ~e.g., Keet, 1968;\nMorimoto and Iida, 1995! and noise ~e.g., Chernyak and Du-\nbrovsky, 1968; Blauert and Lindemann, 1986!. The main\nproblem with these types of stimuli is that the IACC can vary\na great deal over time, as shown by Mason et al. ~2003!,\nwhich makes it difficult to specify the actual IACC value to\nwhich a given perceptual effect relates, be it the maximum,\nminimum, or some type of average.\nThe stimuli chosen for use in the experiments described\nin this paper are based on suppressed carrier amplitude\nmodulation with a time offset between the channels. Two\nsignals, s1 and s2 , are created as shown in Eqs. ~1! and ~2!;\nwhere f c is the carrier frequency, f m is the modulation fre-\nquency, and tm is the time offset defined as @1\/(4 f m)#\ns15sin~2p f ct !sin~2p f mt !, ~1!\ns25sin~2p f c@ t1tm# !sin~2p f m@ t1tm# !. ~2!\nA two-channel output signal, l and r, is then created by mix-\ning signals s1 and s2 ; one in phase and one phase inverted\nbetween the channels, as shown in Eqs. ~3! and ~4!. Assum-\ning that the stimuli are reproduced to the subjects over head-\nphones, the IACC of the output signal can be altered by\nvarying the gain value G. A range of values of G of 0 to 1\nresults in a range of values of IACC of 21 to 1, and it is\npossible to set the IACC to be any value within this range:\nl5Gs11~12G !s2 , ~3!\nr5Gs12~12G !s2 . ~4!\nThe relationship between the gain G and the resulting IACC\nis independent of f c for the range used, but is not linear, as is\nshown in Fig. 1. This means that a linear variation in GMason et al.: Frequency dependency of perceived width\nresults in a small variation in the resulting IACC close to 1\nand 21 where the ear is more sensitive to small changes, and\na larger variation in the resulting IACC close to 0 where the\near is less sensitive to small changes ~Gabriel and Colburn,\n1981; Boehnke et al., 2002!.\nThe modulation frequency\u2014f m in Eqs. ~1! and ~2!\u2014of\nthis type of stimulus affects the bandwidth and the time in-\nvariance of the IACC in a contrary manner, which requires a\ncompromise. For the experiments described in this paper, the\nvalue of f m was set to be 20 Hz, which resulted in a band-\nwidth of 40 Hz ~slightly wider than a critical band at low\ncenter frequencies! and a constant IACC over time for an\nintegration window of 50 ms or longer ~resulting in an IACC\nthat is perceptually time invariant for the majority of listen-\ners, excluding the most sensitive!.\nThe center frequency of a stimulus is set by altering the\ncarrier frequency, f c in Eqs. ~1! and ~2!. It was confirmed\nthat the IACC of the stimuli could be adjusted by altering the\nvalue of G in Eqs. ~3! and ~4!, and that this caused only\nminimal changes in the perceived timbre of the stimuli. The\ninterested reader is referred to Mason et al. ~2003! for more\ninformation.\nThe stimuli were generated using computer software,\nwhich allowed variation of G in real time in 128 equal steps\nbetween 0.5 and 1 ~giving a range of IACC of 0 to 1 as\nshown in Fig. 1!. The output signal was fed through a 16-bit\nDAC to a pair of Sennheiser HD-580 headphones.\nThe stimuli were reproduced at a sound pressure level\n~measured individually at each ear! corresponding to 70\nphons, as derived from the equal loudness contours con-\ntained in ISO 226 ~1987!. Whereas the data contained in ISO\n226 are intended for pure tone stimuli as opposed to these\ntwo-tone experiment stimuli, informal listening by the au-\nthors confirmed that the stimuli were all of similar loudness\nafter alignment.\nB. Procedure\nThe experiments were conducted using a \u2018\u2018method of\nadjustment\u2019\u2019 paradigm ~Gescheider, 1997!, where the sub-\njects were asked to adjust a variable stimulus to be the same\nperceived auditory source width as a given fixed stimulus.\nThe fixed stimuli were presented individually, and were con-\ntinuously looped so that the subjects could take as long as\nrequired to adjust the auditory source width of the variable\nstimulus. The subjects could switch between the variable and\nfixed stimuli whenever and as often as they required, and\ncould move on to the next fixed stimulus when they were\nsatisfied with their result. The switching between the stimuli\nwas instantaneous, with a 20-ms cross-fade to avoid audible\nclicks. The user interface was configured so that the subjects\ncould alter the IACC of the variable stimulus either by mov-\ning an on-screen slider with a mouse or by using a hardware\nslider. The subjects could switch between the stimuli using\neither the mouse or hardware buttons. The order of presen-\ntation of the stimuli was randomized by the computer to\navoid biases caused by order effects; this also rendered the\ntest double blind ~i.e., neither the subjects nor the experi-\nmenter knew which fixed stimulus was which!.\nThe benefits of the method of adjustment procedure overJ. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 117, No. 3, Pt. 1, March 2005other experimental methods are that it is relatively efficient\nin terms of the amount of time required to undertake the\nexperiment, and the intrasubject repeatability is high ~Hesse,\n1986!. In addition, as the subjects have an active role in the\nexperiment, it is less likely that their performance will suffer\ndue to boredom or fatigue ~Cardozo, 1965!. However, there\nare two main drawbacks to the method of adjustment proce-\ndure. First, it is possible that in an experiment with a large\nnumber of repetitions that require similar adjustments to be\nmade in each case, a bias will be caused by habituation and\nexpectation ~Gescheider, 1997!. Second, the method lacks\nthe robustness of other procedures, i.e., it is dependent on the\njudgment of the subjects that a match is \u2018\u2018good enough\u2019\u2019\n~Wier et al., 1976!, as opposed to a strict statistical method\nsuch as that used in a two-alternative forced choice ~2AFC!\nexperiment ~Levitt, 1971!. It is apparent that the effects of\nthese drawbacks can be reduced by the use of carefully se-\nlected subjects and, in view of this, it was decided that the\nadvantages of the procedure outweighed the disadvantages\nfor these experiments.\nC. Subjects\nAs the method of adjustment procedure is strongly de-\npendent on the ability of the subject, a pilot experiment was\nused to select a small panel of suitable listeners. This used\nthe same procedure and a subset of the stimuli from the main\nexperiments, and also served to train the subjects in the ex-\nperiment task and to enable them to become familiar with the\ntypes of stimuli that were used throughout. The subjects were\nselected based on their consistency ~between judgments for\nmultiple iterations of the same stimuli! and accuracy ~of\nmatching the IACC of a fixed stimulus that had the same\ncenter frequency as the variable stimulus!. Seven subjects\nwere selected from the 25 who undertook the pilot experi-\nment. The selected subjects included one female and six\nmales, with an age range of 21 to 35, one of which was the\nfirst author. They were either final year undergraduates, post-\ngraduates, or staff from the Institute of Sound Recording,\nand could therefore be considered to be experienced critical\nlisteners. The subjects were instructed that there were no\ncorrect answers in the experiment, and that they would only\nbe rated on the consistency of their judgments.\nIII. EXPERIMENT 1\u2014EFFECT OF FREQUENCY\nON PERCEIVED AUDITORY SOURCE WIDTH WHEN\nIACC\u02dc1\nA. Introduction\nThe research of Perrott et al. ~1980! showed that the\nperceived auditory source width ~which they termed \u2018\u2018tonal\nvolume\u2019\u2019! of an auditory stimulus was dependent on the cen-\nter frequency, even for a simple diotic stimulus ~i.e., a signal\nthat is identical at each ear and therefore has an IACC of 1!,\nsuch as a single sine tone. As it is known that the IACC has\nan inverse relationship with the perceived auditory source\nwidth, it can be assumed that stimuli with an IACC of 1 will\nrepresent the narrowest condition at a particular frequency.\nIn view of this, the first experiment examined the effect of\nthe frequency of a stimulus on its perceived auditory source1339Mason et al.: Frequency dependency of perceived width\nFIG. 2. Means and associated 95% confidence intervals\nof the 1-IACC of the variable stimulus centered on\n3240 Hz that the subjects judged to have the same au-\nditory source width as each fixed stimulus in experi-\nment 1 ~subjective result!, together with the results pre-\ndicted by Eq. ~5! ~modeled result!.width for an IACC of 1, in order to determine a baseline\nfrom which any changes in the perceived auditory source\nwidth caused by variations in the IACC can be calculated.\nB. Stimuli\nStimuli based on amplitude modulation, as described\nabove, were used in the experiment. The stimuli were created\nusing Eqs. ~1!\u2013~4!, with f m520 Hz and G51.0. In order to\nexamine the effect of the frequency of the stimulus on the\nperceived auditory source width, fixed stimuli with a range\nof values of f c were used with octave spacing: 100, 200, 400,\n800, 1600, 3200, 6400, and 12 800 Hz.\nThe variable stimulus that was used in the experiment\nwas created using f m520 Hz and f c53240 Hz. The value of\nf m was chosen to match the fixed stimuli, and the value of f c\nwas chosen ~from informal listening by the experimenters! to\ngive a range of variation of auditory source width for the\nvariable stimulus that encompassed the range of widths\npresent in the fixed stimuli.\nC. Procedure\nThere were eight fixed stimuli in the experiment; for\neach of these the subjects were asked to adjust the variable\nstimulus until they judged it to have the same auditory\nsource width as the fixed stimulus. The experiment com-\nprised four repetitions, each presented in a different random\norder. All seven selected subjects undertook the full experi-\nment.\nD. Results\nThe results of the subjective experiment were analyzed\nby calculating the IACC of the variable stimulus that the\nsubjects judged to have the same perceived auditory source\nwidth as each fixed stimulus. The means and associated 95%\nconfidence intervals of these results are shown as the subjec-\ntive result in Fig. 2, with the center frequency of each fixed\nstimulus along the x axis and the IACC value subtracted1340 J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 117, No. 3, Pt. 1, March 2005from 1 ~1-IACC! of the matched variable stimulus on the y\naxis. The IACC scale is inverted in this manner to give a\npositive correlation with the perceived auditory source\nwidth, as discussed earlier. The wide variation in 1-IACC,\nresulting from changes in the center frequency of the fixed\nstimulus, equates to a wide variation in perceived auditory\nsource width, despite the fact that the IACC was set to be 1\nfor all the fixed stimuli. It may be interpreted from these\nresults that the low-frequency fixed stimuli were perceived to\nbe widest, with a monotonic decrease in the auditory source\nwidth to approximately 1600 Hz. Above 3200 Hz the per-\nceived auditory source width appears to rise again.\nThe results from this experiment can be modeled by a\nfrequency-dependent equation, as shown in Eq. ~5!, where b\npredicts the 1-IACC of the variable stimulus whose auditory\nsource width would be judged to match that of a fixed stimu-\nlus with center frequency f. This is shown in Fig. 2 as the\nmodeled result:\nb5\nsin@~5Af 14000!\/100#11\nf 0.2 10.07, 100< f <12800.\n~5!\nIt is reasonable to expect that the perceived widths of two\nsimilar stimuli having similar center frequencies and the\nsame IACC and loudness will be approximately equal.\nTherefore, when the center frequency of the fixed stimulus is\nclose to that of the variable stimulus, it is reasonable to ex-\npect that the subjects will adjust the IACC of the variable\nstimulus to be similar to the IACC of the fixed stimulus.\nBased on this expectation, the 1-IACC of the variable stimu-\nlus adjusted to match the width of the fixed stimulus with a\ncenter frequency of 3200 Hz should be approximately 0, but\nit can be seen from Fig. 2 that in fact it has a mean value of\n0.043. It is likely that this discrepancy was caused by a floor\neffect in the experiment due to the finite range of variation\navailable with the variable stimulus. This may mean that the\nstimuli that were judged to be narrowest ~those centered onMason et al.: Frequency dependency of perceived width\n1600 and 3200 Hz! were actually narrower than the subjec-\ntive results shown in Fig. 2 suggest and may also be the\ncause of the offset of 0.07 in the prediction model shown in\nEq. ~5!. However, the likely error is small compared to the\nrange of results for the other experimental stimuli, and there-\nfore has not been corrected in the model.\nIt must be noted that the shape of the subjective result\ncurve in Fig. 2 and the modeled result in Eq. ~5! inevitably\nare partly influenced by the center frequencies of the stimuli\nthat were used in the experiment, and that the use of a greater\nnumber of fixed stimuli with center frequencies between\nthose used would allow for a more accurate model. Also, Eq.\n~5! has been derived to match the subjective results to IACC\nmeasurement results, and it may be necessary to revise this\nonce further adaptations are made to the IACC calculation in\nlater sections of the paper.\nE. Discussion\nThe physiological explanation for these subjective re-\nsults is as yet unknown; however, a mechanism for incorpo-\nrating the results of this experiment into a model of auditory\nsource width perception needs to be derived. Since the\nstimuli used in this experiment all have a 1-IACC of 0, sim-\nply adding the baseline function shown in Eq. ~5! to the\nmeasured 1-IACC should provide a realistic measure of per-\nceived auditory source width for these stimuli. The validity\nof this approach when applied to the measured results of\nstimuli with a range of IACC values is tested implicitly in\nthe experiments described below.\nIV. EXPERIMENT 2\u2014EFFECT OF BREAKDOWN\nOF PHASE LOCKING ON PERCEPTION OF IACC\nA. Introduction\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, it is expected that the\nresults of the research that are reported in this paper will be\nimplemented as part of a more complete model of binaural\nhearing. One feature that is commonly found in such models\nis a simulation of the breakdown of phase locking in the\nneural output of the ear above a certain frequency ~Stern and\nTrahiotis, 1997!.\nDetailed models have been developed to mimic the lim-\nited firing rate of the neural synapses ~Meddis et al., 1990!,\nthough this effect is commonly approximated by the use of\nhalf-wave rectification followed by a low-pass filter ~e.g.,\nKarjalainen, 1996!. Bernstein and Trahiotis ~1996b! investi-\ngated the effect of a half-wave rectification and low-pass\nfiltering preprocess on IACC-based calculations used to pre-\ndict the binaural detection performance of a group of sub-\njects for a range of stimuli. They found that the addition of\nthis preprocess led to predictions which matched their em-\npirical results quite accurately. As binaural detection and per-\nception of auditory source width appear to be similar in their\nassociation with the IACC, it is likely that this type of simu-\nlation of the breakdown of phase locking will be applicable\nto prediction of the perceived auditory source width of\nstimuli.\nHowever, the majority of auditory source width models\nthat are based on the IACC do not employ such a simulation.J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 117, No. 3, Pt. 1, March 2005In view of this, it is of interest to investigate whether phase\nlocking has any effect on auditory source width perception\nand, if so, whether simulation of this using rectification and\nfiltering is an appropriate addition to an auditory source\nwidth model. If this is the case, then the optimum filter char-\nacteristics must also be determined.\nB. Stimuli\nThe amplitude-modulation-based stimuli that were used\nfor the previous experiment have an interesting property that\ncan be employed to investigate the effect of the breakdown\nof phase locking on the perceived auditory source width of a\nstimulus. If a stimulus with an IACC of 0 is created @there-\nfore G50.5 in Eqs. ~3! and ~4!# when f c5(2n21) f m where\nn is an integer, then each output channel contains only one\ntonal component, the frequency of which is f c1 f m in one\nchannel and f c2 f m in the other. This means that there is no\nin-channel amplitude modulation, and the decorrelation of\nthe two channels is due to the constantly varying phase dif-\nference between them caused by the different frequency\ntones in each channel. Conversely, when G50.5 and f c\n52n f m , the two tonal components are combined in each of\nthe output channels, which causes in-channel amplitude\nmodulation in each of them. In this case the decorrelation is\ncaused by the fluctuations in the interchannel level difference\nover time as well as a change in the interchannel phase dif-\nference every quarter of the modulation period. This can be\nseen in the plots of the examples of each stimulus type\nshown in Fig. 3. For ease of reference, stimuli with f c\n5(2n21)fm will be referred to as type 1, and stimuli with\nf c52n f m will be referred to as type 2.\nFor both of these types of stimuli, the IACC is 0. How-\never, the IACC of the amplitude envelopes of the two signals\nis very different, where type 1 stimuli have an envelope\nIACC of 1, and type 2 stimuli have an envelope IACC that is\nmuch lower ~the actual value of the IACC will be dependent\non the method used to extract the envelope of the signal!.\nThis is shown in detail by Mason et al. ~2003!. While the\nenvelope differences between type 1 and type 2 signals may\nnot be perceived at lower frequencies, it is possible that they\nwill be perceived at higher frequencies where the breakdown\nof phase locking may cause the human perceptual system to\nfail to track the fine detail of the stimuli.\nFor this experiment, the stimuli were created using the\nsame suppressed carrier amplitude modulation technique that\nwas used in the previous experiment, though in this case all\nthe fixed stimuli used G50.5 which resulted in an IACC of\n0. The center frequencies ( f c) of the fixed stimuli were cho-\nsen to encompass the range of frequencies around which pre-\nvious research indicated the breakdown of phase locking\nmay start to take effect. Ten center frequencies ~values of f c)\nwere used for each stimulus type\u2014type 1: 180, 300, 420,\n580, 740, 940, 1180, 1460, 1820, and 2260 Hz; type 2: 200,\n320, 440, 600, 760, 960, 1200, 1480, 1840, and 2280 Hz.\nThis gave 20 fixed stimuli for the experiment.\nIn order to compare like with like, two variable stimuli\nwere used, one of each type. The frequencies of the variable\nstimuli were chosen to be well below the frequency at which\nthe breakdown of phase locking may start to have an effect,1341Mason et al.: Frequency dependency of perceived width\nFIG. 3. An example signal of type 1\nwith a center frequency of 220 Hz and\na gain ~G! of 0.5 in the left plot, and\nan example signal of type 2 with a\ncenter frequency of 240 Hz and a gain\n~G! of 0.5 in the right plot.and to be able to cover as much of the range of auditory\nsource widths of the fixed stimuli as possible, as judged by\nthe authors in informal listening. The type 1 variable stimu-\nlus had a value of f c of 220 Hz and the type 2 variable\nstimulus had a value of f c of 240 Hz. As for the previous\nexperiment, the value of f m was fixed for all the stimuli at 20\nHz.\nC. Procedure\nThere were 20 fixed stimuli in the experiment; for each\nof these the subjects were asked to adjust the corresponding\nvariable stimulus until they judged it to have the same audi-\ntory source width as the fixed stimulus. The experiment com-\nprised two repetitions, each presented in a different random\norder. All seven selected subjects undertook the full experi-\nment.\nD. Results\nThe results of this subjective experiment were analyzed\nby calculating the IACC of the variable stimulus that the\nsubjects judged to have the same perceived auditory source\nwidth as each fixed stimulus. The means and associated 95%\nconfidence intervals of these results are shown in Fig. 4, with\nthe center frequency of each fixed stimulus along the x axis\nand 1-IACC of the matched variable stimulus on the y axis,\nwith the left plot showing the results for the type 1 stimuli\nand the right plot showing the results for the type 2 stimuli.\nIn both plots, an increase on the y axis can be interpreted as\nan increase in the perceived auditory source width.\nAs for the previous experiment, it is reasonable to ex-\npect that the subjects would adjust the IACC of the variable\nstimulus to be similar to the IACC of the fixed stimulus with\na similar center frequency, i.e., in this case that the mean\n1-IACC of the variable stimuli adjusted to match the width\nof the fixed stimuli with center frequencies of 180 and 2001342 J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 117, No. 3, Pt. 1, March 2005Hz would be approximately 1. It can be seen in Fig. 4 that\nthe variable stimuli matched to the width of the fixed stimuli\ncentered on 180 and 200 Hz have IACCs of 0.89 and 0.8,\nrespectively. It is likely that the discrepancy between the\nexpected and actual results is partially due to a ceiling effect\nin the experiment due to the finite range of variation avail-\nable with the variable stimulus. The fact that there appears to\nbe a greater difference between the expected and actual re-\nsults for the type 2 stimuli than for the type 1 stimuli is\nexplained later.\nIf the breakdown of phase locking in the ear does need\nto be taken into account in an IACC-based model of auditory\nsource width, then this will be evident as differences between\nthe results at similar frequencies for the two types of stimuli,\nespecially at higher frequencies. It can be seen in Fig. 4 that\nthe results for the type 1 stimuli above approximately 1 kHz\nindicate that these were perceived to be significantly nar-\nrower than the type 2 stimuli with similar center frequencies.\nThis indicates that the breakdown of phase locking does in-\ndeed affect the relationship between the IACC and perceived\nauditory source width, and that this should therefore be taken\ninto account in a model.\nThe most suitable type of low-pass filter was then iden-\ntified as follows. Each fixed stimulus used in the experiment\nwas passed through a trial filter and its IACC was calculated\nto give the modeled result. The variable stimulus that each\nsubject matched to it was analyzed similarly, and the means\nand associated 95% confidence intervals were calculated to\ngive the subjective result. The results from the two sets of\nfiltered IACC measurements were compared, with an appro-\npriate offset to compensate for any outstanding frequency-\ndependent differences between the variable and fixed stimuli.\nThis procedure was repeated using a number of different trial\nfilter types, including that proposed by Bernstein and Trahi-\notis ~1996b!. The best fit between the subjective and modeled\nresults was found with the use of half-wave rectificationMason et al.: Frequency dependency of perceived width\nFIG. 4.

Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 117, No. 3, Pt. 1, March 2005 Mason et al.: Frequency dependency of perceived width\nfollowed by a sixth-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a\ncutoff frequency of 1 kHz. The relevant comparison is shown\nin Fig. 5 ~the term 1-IACCf refers to a calculation made after\nhalf-wave rectification and filtering as described in the Ap-\npendix!.\nIt can be seen in Fig. 5 that in terms of the shape of the\nsubjective results in the region of 1 kHz there is a difference\nbetween the two stimulus types. The authors currently cannot\noffer an explanation for this, and the optimum filter type was\nchosen based on matching the range of the 95% confidence\nintervals for as many data points as possible. It is also appar-\nent from Fig. 5 that the modeled results do not accurately\nmatch the subjective results at low frequencies; it was there-\nfore necessary to ignore the results at low frequencies in\norder to obtain a good fit. This mismatch at low frequencies\nmay be caused by a further frequency dependency in the\nrelationship between the IACC and the perceived auditory\nsource width. However, further investigation is required to\nverify this.\nE. Discussion\nIt must be noted that half-wave rectification of a signal\ncauses the possible range of IACC values to reduce. An au-\ndio signal that has an IACC of 0 before half-wave rectifica-\ntion will have an IACC of approximately 0.4 after half-wave\nrectification. In a similar manner, an audio signal that has an\nIACC of 21 before half-wave rectification will have an\nIACC of approximately 0 after half-wave rectification. This\ndifference in the measured IACC values is partly caused by\nthe fact that half-wave rectified signals have a nonzero mean\n~i.e., they contain a dc offset!. The effect that this has on the\nmeasured result could be negated by subtracting the mean\nvalue of each of the input signals before calculation, result-\ning in a cross-covariance calculation as defined by Lynn and\nFuerst ~1998!. However, Bernstein and Trahiotis ~1996a!\nshowed that the cross-correlation calculation ~that they\ntermed the normalized correlation! gave a better match to the\nperceived properties of high-frequency signals than the\ncross-covariance calculation ~that they termed the normal-\nized covariance!. For the purposes of the model of perceived\nauditory source width that is under development in this pa-\nper, using the cross-covariance calculation would result in an\noverestimation of the dissimilarity of the high-frequency sig-\nnals that have been half-wave rectified and low-pass filtered.\nIt is possible that the use of a more physiologically ac-\ncurate model of the transduction process of the ear will give\nan improved match to the subjective data, compared to half-\nwave rectification and low-pass filtering. However, this will\nbe at the expense of an increase in the required computation,\nand the improvement in the match to the subjective data is\nlikely to be small.\nIn view of this reduction in the range of possible IACC\nvalues, the function that was derived at the end of the previ-\nous experiment needs to be modified. In order to update this\nprevious model, the analysis of that experiment was repeated\nusing the 1-IACCf calculation ~including the half-wave rec-\ntification and low-pass filtering!. This analysis resulted in a\nsimilar equation to that shown in Eq. ~5!. The result, now in\nterms of 1-IACCf, is shown in Eq. ~6!, where b predicts the1344 J. Acoust. Soc.

Comparison between type 1 and type 2 variable\nstimuli\nIn order to allow comparison between the results for the\ntwo types of stimuli, an additional experiment was con-\nducted. Fixed type 2 stimuli were created with a center fre-\nquency ( f c) of 240 Hz and IACC values of 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6,\n0.8, and 1.0. The subjects were then asked to match the per-\nceived auditory source width of these stimuli using a type 1\nvariable stimulus with a center frequency ( f c) of 220 Hz.\nThe same seven selected subjects undertook this experiment,\nand they were asked to adjust the variable stimulus until they\njudged it to have the same auditory source width as each\nfixed stimulus in turn, as for the previous experiments. The\nexperiment comprised two repetitions, each with the fixed\nstimuli presented in a different random order.\nThe results of this experiment were analyzed by calcu-\nlating the IACC of the variable stimulus that the subjects\njudged to have the same perceived auditory source width as\neach fixed stimulus. The means and associated 95% confi-\ndence intervals of these results are shown in Fig. 6, with the\n1-IACC of each fixed stimulus ~type 2 centered on 240 Hz!\nalong the x axis and the 1-IACC of the matched variable\nstimulus ~type 1 centered on 220 Hz! on the y axis.\nThese results indicate that for the variable type 1 stimu-\nlus to have the same auditory source width as the fixed type\n2 stimulus with a given 1-IACC value, the former requires a\nlower 1-IACC value than the latter. In addition, it appears\nthat the perceived auditory source width of the fixed type 2\nstimuli with 1-IACC values of 0.8 and 1 are both matched by\nthe same type 1 stimulus. These results can be interpreted as\nfollows. First, it appears that the type 1 stimulus with a given\n1-IACC value will be perceived to be slightly wider than the\ntype 2 stimulus with the same 1-IACC value. Second, it ap-\npears that the auditory source width of the type 2 stimulus\ndoes not increase if the 1-IACC is increased from approxi-\nmately 0.8 to 1. It is likely that the latter effect is the cause of\nthe larger discrepancy between the expected and actual re-\nsults for the type 2 stimulus at 200 Hz compared to the type\n1 stimulus at 180 Hz. While the discrepancy between the\nIACCs is greater, the fact that there appears to be little\nchange in the perceived width between a 1-IACC of 0.8 and\na 1-IACC of 1 for the associated variable stimulus may mean\nthat the perceptual discrepancy is small. For the stimuli that\nwere tested, a reasonable conversion from the 1-IACC re-\nsults for the type 2 stimuli to the 1-IACC results for the type\n1 stimuli can be made by multiplying the former by 0.85.Mason et al.: Frequency dependency of perceived width\nFIG. 6. Means and associated 95% confidence intervals\nof the 1-IACC of the type 1 variable stimulus with a\ncenter frequency of 220 Hz that the subjects judged to\nhave the same auditory source width as the type 2 fixed\nstimuli with a center frequency of 240 Hz and a range\nof 1-IACC values.V. EXPERIMENT 3\u2014INVESTIGATION\nOF LOW-FREQUENCY STIMULI WITH IACC\u02dc0\nA. Introduction\nFor some time, the relationship between the IACC and\nthe perceived auditory source width at low frequencies has\nbeen considered to be a problem. For instance, signals that\ncontain spectral information solely below approximately 500\nHz generally exhibit little variance in IACC compared to\nsignals that contain spectral information solely above this\nrange, and at low frequencies natural sounds rarely have an\nIACC much less than 1 ~Hidaka et al., 1995!. This is thought\nto be due to the small physical distance between the ears\ncompared to the wavelength of the sound for low-frequency\nstimuli, though this is complicated by the diffraction and\nscattering of the sound by the head ~Lindevald and Benade,\n1986!. Tohyama and Suzuki ~1989! found that the modeling\nequation derived by Cook et al. ~1955! could be used to pre-\ndict the IACC of a diffuse field, but only by using an equiva-\nlent ear spacing of 32.8 cm as opposed to the true interaural\ndistance of approximately 16 cm.\nAlthough the IACC of low-frequency stimuli ~below a\nfew hundred Hertz! rarely varies far from a value of 1, re-\nsearch has shown that low-frequency stimuli can vary sig-\nnificantly in their perceived auditory source width\n~Morimoto and Maekawa, 1988; Griesinger, 1997; Martens,\n1999!. Griesinger ~1992! suggests that it is possible that the\nhuman auditory system compensates for the lack of decorre-\nlation at low frequencies. The disparity between low-\nfrequency IACC and perceived auditory source width has led\nprevious investigations into IACC-based models of per-\nceived auditory source width to recommend ignoring the re-\nsults at low frequencies ~Hidaka et al., 1995!. However, it is\nimportant to deal with the disparity in order to create a model\nthat can accurately predict the perceived auditory source\nwidth of a wide range of stimuli.\nIn view of the above, an experiment was conducted to\ninvestigate whether the relationship between the IACC andJ. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 117, No. 3, Pt. 1, March 2005the perceived auditory source width is dependent on fre-\nquency at low frequencies, and, if so, to derive an appropri-\nate model.\nB. Stimuli\nThe amplitude-modulation-based stimuli described in\nEqs. ~1!\u2013~4! were again used for this experiment. All of the\nfixed stimuli had a value of G of 0.5, giving an IACC of 0.\nFourteen different center frequencies ~values of f c) were\nused for each type of stimulus\u2014type 1: 100, 140, 180, 260,\n300, 340, 380, 420, 460, 580, 660, 740, 820, and 940 Hz;\ntype 2: 120, 160, 200, 280, 320, 360, 400, 440, 480, 600,\n680, 760, 840, and 960 Hz. In order to reduce the number of\njudgments required in the experiment, a number of the fixed\nstimuli that were identical to those in the previous experi-\nment were omitted from this experiment, and for these the\nresults were taken from the previous experiment. However,\nfour of the fixed stimuli were identical between the two ex-\nperiments in order to test the repeatability of the results and\nto confirm that the results from the two experiments could be\ncombined.\nAs for the previous experiment, two types of variable\nstimuli were employed in order that the experiment com-\npared like with like with regard to stimulus type. The same\nvariable stimuli were used as in the previous experiment\n~type 1 f c5220 Hz and type 2 f c5240 Hz), in order to be\nable to combine the results from the two experiments. How-\never, it is possible that the maximum perceivable auditory\nsource width available with these variable stimuli is not as\ngreat as the auditory source width of the lower frequency\nfixed stimuli, which may cause a ceiling effect in the results.\nThis will be considered in the analysis and discussion of the\nresults.1345Mason et al.: Frequency dependency of perceived width\nFIG. 7. Means and associated 95% confidence intervals of the 1-IACC of the variable stimulus that the subjects judged to have the same auditory source width\nas each fixed stimulus that was identical in experiments 2 and 3, separated by the stimulus type and the fixed stimulus center frequency.C. Procedure\nThere were 20 fixed stimuli in the experiment; for each\nof these the subjects were asked to adjust the corresponding\nvariable stimulus until they judged it to have the same audi-\ntory source width as the fixed stimulus. The experiment com-\nprised two repetitions, each presented in a different random\norder. All seven selected subjects undertook the full experi-\nment.\nD. Results\nThe first stage of the analysis involved an examination\nof the similarity between the results of this experiment and\nthe results of the previous experiment for the four repeated\nfixed stimuli, in order to determine whether the results from\nthe two experiments could be combined. As for the previous\nexperiments, the analysis involved calculating the IACC of\nthe variable stimulus that the subjects judged to have the\nsame perceived auditory source width as each fixed stimulus.\nThe means and associated 95% confidence intervals of these\nresults, shown in Fig. 7, display no statistically significant\ndifferences between the two experiments, which means that\nthe data from the two experiments can be combined.\nThe means and associated 95% confidence intervals of\nthe combined results are shown in Fig. 8, with the measured\n1-IACC of the variable stimulus that the subjects considered\nto be the same auditory source width as each fixed stimulus1346 J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 117, No. 3, Pt. 1, March 2005on the y axis, and the center frequency of the fixed stimulus\non the x axis, separated by the stimulus type.\nThe results shown in Fig. 8 support those from the pre-\nvious experiment, in that the perceived auditory source width\nof a stimulus appears to increase as its center frequency falls\nbelow approximately 400 Hz. Above 400 Hz, the perceived\nauditory source width appears to be almost constant up to the\nfrequency at which the breakdown of phase locking starts to\ntake effect. It must be noted that the perceived auditory\nsource width of the stimuli at low frequencies may be greater\nthan that indicated in Fig. 8, as it is possible that the results\nbelow approximately 200 Hz were subject to a ceiling effect\ncaused by the limited maximum auditory source width of the\nvariable stimulus.\nWhen investigating a suitable method for modeling this\nfrequency dependency, it was logical to start with the re-\nsearch of Lindevald and Benade ~1986! and Tohyama and\nSuzuki ~1989!. As the results of these two studies were al-\nmost identical over the frequency range tested, the simpler\nformula of Tohyama and Suzuki was employed, the equiva-\nlent of which is shown in Eq. ~7!, where s is the mean IACC\nin a diffuse field, f is the frequency, d is equivalent to the\ndistance between the ears ~calculated by Tohyama and Su-\nzuki to be 0.328 m!, and c is the speed of sound in air:\ns5sinc~2 f d\/c !. ~7!\nThe accuracy of the match between the experiment resultsMason et al.: Frequency dependency of perceived width\nFIG. 8.

An IACC was calculated for each of the fixed stimuli\nafter preprocessing with the half-wave rectification and low-\npass filtering derived from experiment 2 ~giving a result in\nterms of 1-IACCf). This value was then modified by multi-\nplying it by s @Eq. ~7!# ~giving a result in terms of\n1-IACCfs). Finally, in order to examine the effect of the\nbaseline compensation derived from experiment 1, b @Eq.\n~6!# was added ~giving a result in terms of 1-IACCfsb). This\nis termed the modeled result. The variable stimulus that the\nsubjects matched to each fixed stimulus was also processed\nusing this method ~giving a result in terms of 1-IACCfsb),\nand the means and associated 95% confidence intervals were\ncalculated to give what is termed the subjective result.\nThe use of a frequency-dependent multiplier based on s,\ncalculated using values of d50.328 m and c5330 ms21, im-\nproved the match between the subjective and modeled re-\nsults. However, it was found that using values of d50.4 m\nand c5330 ms21 in Eq. ~8! resulted in a closer match. The\nresults of this are shown in Fig. 9:\ns5max~sinc~2 f d\/c !,0!\/310.5. ~8!\nIt is apparent from the results shown in Fig. 9 that the modi-\nfications made to the basic IACC calculation @half-wave rec-\ntification and low-pass filtering of the input signal, multipli-\ncation of the result by the low-frequency compensation s of\nEq. ~8!, and addition of the baseline compensation b of Eq.J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 117, No. 3, Pt. 1, March 2005~6!# mean that the modeled results closely match the subjec-\ntive results judgments in most cases. However, it is also ap-\nparent that the modeled results for the low-frequency stimuli\n~below approximately 200 Hz! are higher than the subjective\nresults. As noted above, it is possible that the limited maxi-\nmum perceived auditory source width of the variable stimu-\nlus caused the auditory source width of these low-frequency\nfixed stimuli to be underestimated. In view of this, it is pos-\nsible that the matching at low frequencies is actually better\nthan these results suggest.\nE. Discussion\nIt is unclear why this experiment shows a better match\nbetween the modeled results and subjective results for a\nvalue of d in Eq. ~8! of 0.4 compared to the value of 0.328\nthat matched the results of modeled measurements in a dif-\nfuse field in previous studies. If it is assumed that the fre-\nquency dependency at low frequencies is due to the human\nperceptual system compensating for the limited range of\nIACC values encountered at those frequencies, then it is pos-\nsible that the difference between the actual interaural dis-\ntance and the interaural distance that gives the most accurate\nprediction of the subjective results is due to overcompensa-\ntion by the auditory system. However, it is not possible, from\nthe current results, to accurately determine the cause of this\neffect.1347Mason et al.: Frequency dependency of perceived width\nFIG. 9.

CONCLUSIONS\nThree experiments were conducted to investigate fea-\ntures of the frequency dependency of the relationship be-\ntween the IACC of an auditory stimulus and its perceived\nauditory source width. Three important findings emerged.\nFirst, the perceived auditory source width of a stimulus\nwith an IACC of 1 decreases monotonically as its frequency\nincreases from a hundred to a few thousand Hertz, beyond\nwhich the perceived auditory source width increases again.\nThe effect on the perceived auditory source width has been\nmodeled with a simple formula, whose application in the\nsubsequent experiments indicates that it provides a reason-\nable match to the subjective results.\nSecond, for IACC-based models of perceived auditory\nsource width, it is important to take into account the loss of\nfine temporal detail at higher audio frequencies that results\nfrom the breakdown of phase locking in the neural output of\nthe ear. This loss of detail causes the perceived auditory\nsource width of higher frequency stimuli to be dependent on\nthe IACC of the envelope of the signal, rather than the signal\nitself. This effect can be modeled by passing the input signal\nthrough a half-wave rectifier and a sixth-order low-pass But-\nterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 1 kHz prior to mea-\nsuring the IACC of the signal.\nFinally, for low-frequency stimuli, human auditory per-\nception appears to make up for the limited range of IACC\nvalues encountered in real situations by introducing an addi-1348 J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 117, No. 3, Pt. 1, March 2005tional frequency dependency in the relationship between the\nIACC and the perceived auditory source width at these fre-\nquencies. This can be modeled by multiplying the IACC by a\nfrequency-dependent factor derived from the expected range\nof IACC values that may be encountered in natural sound\nfields.\nThese three findings can be combined into a single ge-\nneric model termed 1-IACCfsb, which is described by Eq.\n~9!, where w is a prediction of the perceived auditory source\nwidth, l f and r f are the left and right binaural signals that\nhave been half-wave rectified and filtered with a sixth-order\nButterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 1 kHz,\ns is the frequency-dependent weighting factor defined in Eq.\n~8!, and b is the frequency-dependent baseline function de-\nfined in Eq. ~6!:\nw5F 12 max\n21 ms,t,1 ms\nS * t1t2l f~ t !r f~ t1t!dt\n@* t1\nt2l f\n2~ t !dt* t1\nt2\nr f\n2~ t !dt#1\/2D G s1b .\n~9!\nVII. DISCUSSION\nThe experiments that are described in this paper used\nstimuli whose characteristics were tightly controlled and\nconstant over time. These were employed so that it was pos-\nsible to match an objective value to a subjective effect as\naccurately as possible. However, the disadvantage of usingMason et al.: Frequency dependency of perceived width\ntightly controlled stimuli is that they are less externally valid\n~i.e., they are dissimilar to natural audio signals!.\nThe stimuli had a narrow bandwidth and were time in-\nvariant, both in terms of their spectral content and their\nIACC. The perceived auditory source width of stimuli whose\ncharacteristics vary over time has not yet been determined.\nAdditionally, the optimum method for combining measure-\nments that are made in a number of separate frequency bands\nhas not yet been derived. These factors must be investigated\nin order to further develop the model such that it can reason-\nably be used to predict perceived auditory source width for\nnaturally occurring audio signals.\nThis paper only considered stimuli that have positive\nIACC values, as it has been shown that signals with a nega-\ntive IACC are perceived to have differing spatial properties\ncompared to equivalent signals with a positive IACC\n~Plenge, 1972!. Further research is required into the per-\nceived effect of stimuli with a negative IACC to allow this\nfactor to be modeled.\nThe model that has been derived from the results of\nthese experiments gives a prediction of the perceived audi-\ntory source width of the stimuli on a scale that allows com-\nparison between stimuli, but is not related to any physical\nmeasurement of width. It would be useful to be able to pre-\ndict the perceived auditory source width of stimuli in terms\nof a physical distance across for sounds perceived to be\nwithin the head, or in terms of a subtended angle for sounds\nperceived to be outside the head. Further research is required\nto convert the results of the measurement model to such a\nscale.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the Engineering and Physi-\ncal Sciences Research Council ~EPSRC!, UK, Grant No. GR\/\nR55528\/01.

This appendix explains these in\ndetail.\nThe basis for each calculation is the normalized cross-\ncorrelation function ~NCC!. In order for this to be equivalent\nto the IACC, it is essential that the signals analyzed are iden-\ntical to those at the ears of the listener. The NCC is shown in\nEq. ~A1!, where x and y are the two signals whose correla-\ntion is to be calculated, t1 to t2 is the period over which the\ncorrelation is calculated, and t is an offset between the two\nsignals under measurement:\nNCC~t!5\n* t1\nt2x~ t !y~ t1t!dt\n@* t1\nt2x2~ t !dt* t1\nt2y2~ t !dt#1\/2\n. ~A1!\nThe NCC is calculated across a range of t that is equivalent\nto 61 ms, and the IACC is taken to be the maximum value\nacross this range. The values of t1 and t2 are set to give aJ. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 117, No. 3, Pt. 1, March 2005window length of 50 ms, and measurements are made at\n1.5-ms steps throughout the input signal to quantify any\nvariations in IACC over time. However, only the mean of\nthese results is ultimately used. For the stimuli that were\nused in the experiment, it was found that the variations in\nIACC over time measured in this manner were no more than\n60.01. The input signal is not filtered or weighted unless\notherwise stated.\nThe variations on this basic calculation were derived\nfrom the results of the experiments and are denoted using\nsubscript characters. A list of these is given below.\nIACC\u2014basic IACC calculation.\n1-IACC\u2014basic IACC calculation with the result then\nsubtracted from 1.\n1-IACCf\u2014the input signal is half-wave rectified and\nlow-pass filtered using a sixth-order Butterworth filter with a\ncutoff frequency of 1 kHz before using the basic IACC cal-\nculation with the result then subtracted from 1.\n1-IACCfs\u2014the input signal is half-wave rectified and\nlow-pass filtered using a sixth-order Butterworth filter with a\ncutoff frequency of 1 kHz before using the basic IACC cal-\nculation with the result then subtracted from 1 and multiplied\nby the frequency-dependent weighting shown in Eq. ~8!.\n1-IACCfsb\u2014the input signal is half-wave rectified and\nlow-pass filtered using a sixth-order Butterworth filter with a\ncutoff frequency of 1 kHz before using the basic IACC cal-\nculation with the result subtracted from 1, multiplied by the\nfrequency-dependent weighting shown in Eq. ~8!, and then\nadded to the frequency-dependent baseline function shown in\nEq. ~6!.\nAll of the measurements described in the paper were\nmade by analyzing the two-channel experimental stimuli in\nthe digital domain. In order to ensure that the characteristics\nof the stimuli that the subjects heard were similar to those\nmeasured in the digital domain, a number of stimuli were\nreproduced over the system used in the experiment and cap-\ntured using a head and torso simulator ~HATS!. It was found\nthat the measurements made in the digital domain were\nwithin 60.02 of those measurements made of the signals that\nwere captured with the HATS.\nAndo, Y. ~1985!.
