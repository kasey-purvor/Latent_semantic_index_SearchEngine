Magnetospheric physics (Auroral phenomena;\nMagnetospheric configuration and dynamics; Storms and\nsubstorms)\nCorrespondence to: S. E. Milan\n(steve.milan@ion.le.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nSince its discovery in the 1960s (e.g. Akasofu, 1964) the\nauroral substorm has been the subject of intense study due\nto the recognition that it plays a key role in solar wind-\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. In this paper we in-\nvestigate the evolution of the aurora during the growth, ex-\npansion, and recovery phases of substorms in a quantitative,\nstatistical fashion. Previous workers have undertaken sim-\nilar studies, for instance Mende et al. (2003), Coumans et\nal. (2007) and Gjerloev et al. (2007), providing much in-\nsight into the average characteristics of the auroral evolu-\ntion during substorms. However, our primary focus in this\npaper is to examine the role of the substorm in solar wind-\nmagnetosphere coupling, specifically in the closure of open\nflux previously accumulated through magnetic reconnection\nat the dayside magnetopause. Hence, our statistics concen-\ntrate on the substorm response to differing amounts of open\nflux in the magnetosphere at substorm onset. In addition,\nwhereas previous studies have examined a limited number of\nevents, usually of the order of 100, our study encompasses\nobservations from nearly 2000 substorms.\nAs proposed by Dungey (1961) magnetic reconnection be-\ntween the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and the terres-\ntrial magnetopause results in an open magnetosphere, with\nopen field lines being stretched antisunwards to form the\nmagnetotail, before being pinched off again by reconnection\nin the neutral sheet of the tail. Dungey originally envisaged\nthe resulting circulation of field and plasma, now known as\nthe Dungey cycle, as a steady state phenomenon. However,\nit became apparent that this could not be the case, that the\nnightside reconnection rate could not anticipate changes in\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n660 S. E. Milan et al.: Superposed epoch analysis of auroral evolution\nthe dayside reconnection rate, and hence the level of inter-\nconnection between the magnetosphere and the solar wind\nmust be variable. This lead to the formulation of what is\nnow known as the expanding\/contracting polar cap paradigm,\nor ECPC, which explains how variable rates of dayside and\nnightside reconnection lead to changes in the size of the polar\ncap and excite magnetospheric and ionospheric convection\n(Siscoe and Huang, 1985; Cowley and Lockwood, 1992). An\nextension of this was the explicit suggestion that substorms\nwere the process by which the Dungey cycle was closed in\nthe magnetotail (Lockwood and Cowley, 1992).\nIn this picture the bright auroral ovals encircle the dim\npolar caps, which themselves map to the magnetotail lobes\ncomprised of open magnetic field lines. As the fraction of\nmagnetospheric flux that is open increases the polar caps\nexpand and the auroral ovals move to lower latitudes; con-\nversely a contraction of the polar caps signifies a closure of\nopen flux by reconnection in the tail (e.g. Milan et al., 2003,\n2007). The auroral evolution during substorms can be under-\nstood within this framework. The equatorward progression\nof the auroral ovals during substorm growth phase (McPher-\nron, 1970) indicates the increase in open flux through day-\nside reconnection. As the open flux increases the tail mag-\nnetopause flares outwards increasing the cross-section pre-\nsented to the flow of the solar wind and hence the pressure\ninside. At some point this pressure increase can no longer\nbe sustained and reconnection is triggered in the magneto-\ntail neutral sheet to reduce the amount of open flux. As-\nsociated with this is the onset of substorm auroral break-up\nand the substorm expansion phase, as the auroral bulge pro-\ngresses polewards into the polar cap, eastwards and west-\nwards, marking the expanding region of newly-closed flux.\nRecovery phase follows as the magnetosphere returns to a\nquiescent state.\nIt has been suggested that the amount of open magnetic\nflux present in the magnetosphere at the time of substorm\nonset determines the intensity of the substorm, that is the au-\nroral brightness and\/or the strength of the auroral electrojets\n(e.g. Akasofu, 1975; Kamide et al., 1999), though there is\nsome debate as to what causes a particular substorm to trig-\nger at a particular open flux level (e.g. Milan et al., 2008).\nThe aim of the present study is to provide a quantitative esti-\nmate of the average auroral evolution during substorms, par-\nticularly concentrating on differences due to the open flux\ncontent of the magnetosphere at onset. Two studies are un-\ndertaken to investigate this. In the first, reported in Sect. 2,\nwe perform a superposed epoch analysis of the characteris-\ntics of 41 substorms observed during a 10 day period first\ninvestigated by Milan et al. (2008). In the second study, re-\nported in Sect. 3, we perform a superposed epoch analysis\nof auroral images taken by the Imager for Magnetopause-to-\nAurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) mission, keyed to a list\nof the onset times of some 2000 substorms compiled by Frey\net al. (2004). We discuss our findings in Sect. 4.\nThe IMAGE mission provided almost 5 years of observa-\ntions of the Northern and Southern Hemisphere UV aurora,\nbetween 2000 and 2005, using the Far Ultraviolet (FUV) in-\nstrument (Mende et al., 2000a, b) which comprised the Wide-\nband Imaging Camera (WIC) and the Spectrographic Imager\n(SI). WIC was sensitive to auroral emissions over a broad\nrange of the UV spectrum, the primary component of which\nis associated with precipitating electrons. The SI12 channel\nimaged Doppler-shifted Lyman \u03b1 emission associated with\nprecipitating protons. The orbital geometry and spin of the\nIMAGE spacecraft was such that images were captured with\na cadence of 2 min for approximately 10 h of the 14 h orbit.\nIn this paper we use observations from both WIC and SI12\nto investigate the auroral evolution during substorms.\n2 Superposed epoch analysis of Milan et al.

(2008) analysed 10 days, 28 August to 6 Septem-\nber 2005, of WIC auroral observations from the IMAGE\nspacecraft to determine variations in the open flux content\nof the magnetosphere related to changes in upstream so-\nlar wind and IMF conditions and the occurrence of sub-\nstorms. The open flux threading the ionospheric polar cap,\nFPC , was determined by integrating the radial component\nof an assumed dipolar magnetic field through the dim re-\ngion encircled by the auroral oval (see also Boakes et al.,\n2008); that is the poleward boundary of the aurora was iden-\ntified with the open\/closed field line boundary (OCB). As\ndescribed by Milan et al. (2003), SuperDARN radar obser-\nvations and precipitating-particle measurements from polar-\norbiting DMSP satellites were used to constrain the location\nof the OCB, where available. It is difficult to determine the\nuncertainty in values of FPC determined in this way, but Mi-\nlan et al. (2003) suggested that an over- or underestimation\nof the location of the OCB by 1\u25e6 of latitude at all local times\nwould lead to an under- or overestimation of FPC by approx-\nimately 10%.\n49 substorms were identified during the 10-day period, of\nwhich 41 had accompanying auroral images. One of the main\nconclusions of that study was that the open flux content of\nthe magnetosphere increased dramatically and substorms be-\ncame more intense during geomagnetic storm activity when\nthe SYM-H index was depressed. Here we conduct a su-\nperposed epoch analysis of FPC , the maximum in the night-\nside auroral intensity, Imax, the AL and AU auroral electrojet\nindices, and the SYM-H index, and the predicted dayside re-\nconnection rate for the 41 substorms identified by Milan et al.\n(2008). The predicted dayside reconnection rate, 8D , is the\nKan and Lee (1979) reconnection electric field multiplied by\nthe effective width of the solar wind channel that reconnects\nwith the dayside magnetopause. This reconnection potential\nis related to upstream solar wind and IMF conditions by\n8D = LeffVSWBYZ sin2 12\u03b8,\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 659\u2013668, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/659\/2009\/\nS. E. Milan et al.: Superposed epoch analysis of auroral evolution 661\nwhere VSW is the solar wind speed, BYZ is the transverse\ncomponent of the IMF, i.e. BYZ=\n\u221a\nB2Y+B2Z , \u03b8 is the IMF\nclock angle and Leff=2.75RE (Milan et al., 2008).\nEpoch time t is centred on substorm onset which was iden-\ntified in most cases as an increase in auroral brightness, a de-\ncrease in FPC associated with magnetotail reconnection, and\na substorm bay in AL. To investigate the influence of vary-\ning amounts of open flux in the system at substorm onset we\nhave divided the substorms into four categories:\n(i) FPC(t=0)<0.45 GWb,\n(ii) 0.45<FPC(0)<0.55 GWb,\n(iii) 0.55<FPC(0)<0.65 GWb,\n(iv) FPC(0)>0.65 GWb.\nThese limits were chosen so that there were similar numbers\nof substorms in each category, that is 9, 13, 9, and 10, respec-\ntively. Epoch time runs from two hours before to two hours\nafter onset and is divided into 6-min bins. The results are\nshown in Fig. 1. In each panel the thick solid line shows the\nevolution of the median of the parameter in question, while\nthe thin lines show the upper and lower quartiles in each bin.\nWe find that approximately one hour prior to substorm ex-\npansion phase onset there is an increase in the open flux of\nthe magnetosphere: the substorm growth phase. Accompa-\nnying this growth phase is a modest increase in the auroral\nbrightness. In most cases, at expansion phase onset there is\na more dramatic increase in brightness, the open flux content\ndecreases, and there is a negative excursion in the AL index.\nThe exception is category i in which a decrease in open flux\nis observed following onset, but there is no corresponding\nincrease in brightness or bay in AL.\nOverall, the observations clearly show that as the open\nflux at onset increases there is a dramatic increase in: (1)\nthe auroral brightening associated with the substorm; (2) the\ngrowth of open flux prior to onset; (3) the decrease in open\nflux after onset; (4) the duration of the decrease in open\nflux; and (5) the magnitude of the AL bay associated with\nthe substorm. Substorms in category i close approximately\n0.1 GWb of flux, whereas in category iv this rises to 0.3 to\n0.4 GWb. A similar change is seen in the amount of open\nflux accumulated during the growth phase. In each cate-\ngory the growth phase lasts approximately one hour. On the\nother hand, the duration of the decrease in flux after onset\nincreases from 30 min in the case of category i to 80 min in\nthe case of category iv. In category i, the minimum in median\nAL reaches approximately \u2212200 nT, increasing to \u2212600 nT\nin category iv.\nThe dayside reconnection voltage prior to onset increases\nfrom category i to category iv, from an average of 20 kV to\nan average of 100 kV, explaining the more dramatic accumu-\nlation of open flux during the growth phase in the last cate-\ngory. Lastly, we note that SYM-H becomes more negative\nFig. 1. Superposed epoch analysis of 41 substorms identified by\nMilan et al. (2008). From top to bottom, the parameters are: the\nmaximum nightside auroral intensity Imax as measured by WIC; the\nopen magnetic flux FPC estimated from the size of the polar cap;\nthe AL and AU auroral indices; the SYM-H index; the estimated\ndayside reconnection rate 8D . The substorms have been catego-\nrized by the open flux content of the magnetosphere at substorm\nonset. Thick and thin lines show the evolution of the median and\nupper and lower quartile values as a function of epoch time, centred\non substorm onset.\nfrom category i to iv, indicating that FPC increases to larger\nvalues prior to substorm onset when the ring current is en-\nhanced.\nExamination of the relationship between the median and\nquartiles of, say, Imax and8D , suggests that there are perhaps\nsudden changes in these parameters within categories iii and\niv. However, we feel that a much larger sample of events\nwould be needed to ascertain whether this effect is real.\n3 Superposed epoch analysis of IMAGE observations\nTo build on these results, we performed a superposed epoch\nanalysis of the auroral evolution during substorms for as\nlarge a sample of substorms as possible, though concentrat-\ning on observations of the Northern Hemisphere auroral oval.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/659\/2009\/ Ann.

Ver-\ntical dotted lines identify the onset latitude categorizes I to V; num-\nbers indicate the number of substorms in each category. (b) The\nmagnetic local time distribution of onsets.\nPrecession of the apogee of the orbit of IMAGE meant that\nthe Northern Hemisphere auroral oval was imaged best dur-\ning the first two years of the mission, so we focussed our\nstudy on the 2-year period May 2000 to April 2002. Due to\ncontamination of the WIC observations by dayglow we lim-\nited study of WIC images to the winter months of November,\nDecember, and January. Our primary dataset thus comprised\nclose to 400 000 images from SI12 and 100 000 images from\nWIC. This dataset was pre-processed to speed up subsequent\nanalysis. Each image was mapped into a magnetic latitude\nand MLT coordinate system and then re-binned into a 40\u00d740\nCartesian grid of cells 222\u00d7222 km in size (222 km is equiv-\nalent to 2\u25e6 of latitude), centred on the geomagnetic pole\nwith rows and columns aligned along the noon-midnight and\ndawn-dusk meridians.\nSubstorm onset timings were taken from the study of Frey\net al. (2004), who defined onset as a prolonged brightening\nof the nightside auroral oval in the IMAGE dataset. Three\ncriteria were used to indentify onsets: (1) a clear local bright-\nening of the aurora had to occur; (2) the aurora had to expand\nto the poleward boundary of the auroral oval and spread az-\nimuthally in local time for at least 20 min; (3) 30 min had\nto pass since the previous onset. Ideally, this study covered\nthe first two years of the IMAGE mission, identifying 1993\nsubstorms during our period of interest. Frey et al. (2004)\nrecorded a number of characteristic features of each substorm\nonset, including the magnetic latitude, 3onset, and magnetic\nlocal time (MLT) of the initial onset brightening. Onsets\nwere observed at magnetic latitudes between 55\u25e6 and 74\u25e6;\nFig. 2a presents the occurrence distribution of onset latitudes\nfor our period of interest. Onsets at high latitudes indicate\nsubstorms occurring on a contracted auroral oval, onsets at\nlow latitudes on an expanded oval, with corresponding vari-\nations in the amount of open flux in the magnetosphere. Av-\neraging all of these substorms together would inevitably hide\ninteresting dynamics and so we sub-divided our dataset into\nfive categories by substorm onset latitude, 3onset, which we\ndefined to be:\n(I) 3onset>68\u25e6,\n(II) 66\u25e6<3onset<68\u25e6,\n(III) 64\u25e6<3onset<66\u25e6,\n(IV) 62\u25e6<3onset<64\u25e6,\n(V) 3onset<62\u25e6,\nas indicated in Fig. 2a, where the number of onsets in each\ncategory is also shown. For completeness we also show the\nMLT distribution of onsets in Fig. 2b. Most onsets were ob-\nserved between 21:00 and 01:00 MLT, as also found by Gjer-\nloev et al. (2007). We examined the MLT distribution of on-\nsets within each of our five latitudinal bins and found that\nnone had a significant deviation from the overall MLT distri-\nbution.\nFrom this it was straightforward to produce a superposed\nepoch analysis of auroral evolution keyed to onset time. We\nchose our epochs to run from one hour prior to onset to two\nhours after onset, and divided these three hours into 18 10-\nmin bins. Then we averaged the observed intensity in each of\nthe 40\u00d740 cells in all pre-processed images that fell within\neach category, resulting in 10 time-series of images, one for\neach latitude category and camera. By the way of example\nwe show selected images from two of these time-series, the\ncategory IV onsets for both WIC and SI12, in Fig. 3. The se-\nlected images are from the time bins centred on t=\u221255, \u22125,\n+15, and +115 min from substorm onset. To guide the eye,\nsuperimposed on each image is a KP=3 statistical oval from\nFeldstein and Starkov (1967), calculated from the functional\nrepresentation of Holzworth and Meng (1975).\nWe note that there is a considerable dawn-dusk asymmetry\nin the WIC and SI12 observations: the intensity of the auro-\nral oval is greatest at dusk as observed by SI12 and greatest\nat dawn as observed by WIC. As will be discussed in more\ndetail later, there is also an offset in the location of the WIC\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 659\u2013668, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/659\/2009\/\nS. E.

Superimposed on\neach image is a KP =3 Feldstein and Starkov (1967) average auroral\noval.\nand SI12 ovals along the dawn-dusk meridian, SI12 being\nshifted duskwards with respect to WIC. The SI12 and WIC\novals move to lower latitudes between t=\u221255 and \u22125 min,\nmost apparent in the midnight sector, as the polar cap ex-\npands during the growth phase. There is a marked increase\nin auroral brightness and the formation of an auroral bulge\nby t=15 min. By t=115 min the auroral oval has returned to\na configuration similar to that at t=\u221255 min, though there\nis still some residual excess brightness in the post-midnight\nsector, especially in the WIC observations.\nWe extract further information from each averaged image\nby determining the latitude of the peak intensity along the\ndawn, dusk, noon and midnight meridians. The method by\nwhich this is achieved is shown in Fig. 4, for the auroral im-\nage of Fig. 3c. The noon-midnight and dawn-dusk profiles\nof the image are shown in Fig. 4a and c, respectively, by\ncrosses. The vertical dotted lines represent the location of\nthe geomagnetic pole.

The\ncontribution of dayglow to the noon meridian background\nprofile is clearly apparent. However, despite the fact that the\nnoon sector oval is not very bright, it can still be discerned\nabove the background in SI12 images; this is not the case for\nWIC where the dayglow obscures the auroral emission.\nFigure 5 presents the full results of the superposed epoch\nanalysis. Upper panels show the SI12 results, lower panels\nthe WIC results. These are presented as keograms along the\nnoon-midnight and dawn-dusk meridians. In addition, the\nvariation in the latitude of the peak in intensity of the auroral\noval (3max) along the four meridians as a function of epoch\ntime is indicated, as well as the variation in brightness of the\nmidnight sector oval (Amax).\nSeveral conclusions can be drawn immediately from the\nobservations. The brightness of the auroral oval, both prior\nto onset and during the expansion phase, increases as the lat-\nitude of onset decreases. The SI12 oval is brighter on the\ndusk side and the WIC oval is brighter on the dawn side, as\nmentioned before. There is a dawn-dusk offset in the loca-\ntions of the SI12 and WIC ovals: in the SI12 observations\nthe dusk sector oval is located consistently 2 to 4 degrees\nof latitude equatorward of the dawn sector oval; in the WIC\nobservations the dawn and dusk locations are more symmet-\nrical. This offset is consistent with the findings of Mende et\nal. (2003). The increase in brightness in the midnight sector\nfollowing onset, especially as observed by WIC, increases\nwith decreasing onset latitude. Onset is accompanied by an\nincrease in brightness along the dusk meridian for both WIC\nand SI12, with no appreciable increase at dawn, indicating\nconsiderable asymmetry in the substorm auroral bulge, con-\nsistent with the findings of Gjerloev et al. (2007). There is a\nmarked decrease in the oval latitude along all meridians dur-\ning the growth phase, though this is most pronounced for low\nlatitude onsets. The midnight sector oval progresses pole-\nward promptly following onset; the rate and duration of the\npoleward progression increases for decreasing onset latitude.\nThe other meridians can display continued equatorward mo-\ntion for between 20 min and 1 h after onset.\nTo accompany Fig. 5 we conducted superposed epoch\nanalyses of solar wind conditions as observed by ACE (Mc-\nComas et al., 1998; Smith et al., 1998; Stone et al., 1998)\nand lagged to the magnetopause, and geomagnetic indices,\nagain keyed to substorm onset times and subdivided by onset\nlatitude, for the same two-year period. These are IMF BZ ,\nsolar wind speed VSW , density NSW , and dynamic pressure\nPSW , AU, AL and SYM-H, presented in Fig. 6 (in a simi-\nlar format to Fig. 1). The main findings here are that IMF\nBZ becomes more negative prior to low latitude substorms,\nwhile VSW , NSW , and PSW all increase. The AL signature\nbecomes more pronounced for the low latitude onsets. Fi-\nnally, SYM-H tends to be more negative, indicating an en-\nhanced ring current, during the low latitude onsets. These\nobservations will be discussed further in the next section.\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 659\u2013668, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/659\/2009\/\nS. E.

Superposed epoch analyses of IMF BZ , solar wind velocity\nVSW , density NSW , and dynamic pressure PSW , the AU and AL\nindices and SYM-H for the 1993 substorms considered in our study.\n4 Discussion\nWe have conducted two superposed epoch analyses of sub-\nstorm characteristics, keyed to substorm expansion phase on-\nset times. In the first we averaged measured parameters such\nas open magnetic flux FPC and nightside auroral brightness\nduring 41 substorms. In the second we produced time-series\nof averaged auroral images from nearly 2000 substorms, and\nfrom these we derived the average latitude of the oval and its\nbrightness. In both studies we subdivided our dataset by the\namount of open flux in the magnetosphere prior to substorm\nonset, explicitly by FPC in the first study, and by onset lat-\nitude in the second. The conclusions to be drawn from the\ntwo studies are broadly consistent with each other. The main\nconclusion is that substorms are more intense when the open\nflux accumulated prior to onset is greater, as first suggested\nby Akasofu (1975) and Kamide et al. (1999).\nFig. 7. The variations in pre- and post-onset brightness for the dif-\nferent onset latitude categories of substorm. Upper panels show the\nmidnight intensity of the oval, whereas the lower panels show the\nintegrated brightness of the whole oval.\nWith regard to our second study, we must be aware that not\nall auroral brightenings are substorm onsets, and it is possi-\nble that some of the events identified in the list of Frey et\nal. (2004) may be associated with other auroral phenomena\nsuch as pseudo-breakups or poleward boundary intensifica-\ntions (PBIs), the latter described by Lyons et al. (1999) and\ndiscussed in the context of substorm identification by Ros-\ntoker (2002). True substorm onsets occur near the equator-\nward edge of the auroral oval, mapping close to the inner\nedge of the plasma sheet, deep within the closed field line re-\ngion (e.g. Samson et al., 1992). By contrast, PBIs are brief,\n\u223c10 min quasi-periodic brightenings of the poleward bound-\nary of the auroral oval, associated with activations of the\nplasma sheet in the more distant tail. Substorms and PBIs are\nhence manifestations of the \u201cdouble oval\u201d nature of the night-\nside auroral emissions discussed by Elphinstone et al. (1995).\nFrey et al. (2004) did not specifically exclude PBIs from\ntheir list, but their selection criteria (2) and (3), discussed\nin Sect. 3, designed to exclude pseudo-breakups, should also\nrule out many PBI events. For instance, criterion (3) excludes\nevents which occur within 30 min of a previous auroral acti-\nvation, which will catch many periodic PBIs. In addition,\ncriterion (2) states that to be counted as substorms activa-\ntions must expand up to the poleward boundary of the auro-\nral oval and spread azimuthally for 20 min or more, which\nis not consistent with the characteristic behaviour of PBIs.\nHence, we are confident that most events in our analysis are\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/659\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 659\u2013668, 2009\n666 S. E. Milan et al.: Superposed epoch analysis of auroral evolution\nsubstorms, though it is possible that a small fraction of high\nlatitude events, for instance in category I, may be PBIs.\nFigure 7 shows the variation in emission intensity of sub-\nstorms as a function of onset category. Each of the upper pan-\nels shows the brightness along the midnight meridian, the av-\nerage pre-onset (dashed curves) and the maximum post-onset\n(solid curves), for SI12 and WIC. The lower panels show the\nintegrated brightness of the whole auroral oval (in arbitrary\nunits), pre- and post-onset. In the case of SI12, the midnight\nmeridian post-onset brightness increases by almost a factor\nof 3 from category I to category V; for WIC this is closer\nto a factor of 5. In terms of integrated brightness, the SI12\noval increases in intensity by a factor of 8; WIC by compar-\nison increases only by a factor of 4. These results show that\nthe change in brightness in the WIC images is concentrated\nlargely on the nightside in the vicinity of the auroral bulge,\nwhereas the SI12 oval as a whole increases in brightness and\nsuch that the increase is not so concentrated into a nightside\nauroral bulge.\nLooking at the increase in brightness from pre- to post-\nonset within each onset category, in the case of WIC the mid-\nnight brightness and integrated brightness both increase by\napproximately a factor of 2. The increase from pre- to post-\nonset is much less pronounced in the case of SI12. The vari-\nation in SI12 pre-onset brightness with onset category can be\nunderstood in terms of pitch-angle scattering of protons in\nthe stretched magnetic field lines of the tail. As discussed\nby Sergeev et al. (1983) and Blockx et al. (2005), as the\nnightside magnetic field becomes more tail-like, the isotropy\nboundary moves equatorwards and the proton aurora increase\nin brightness due to protons being pitch-angle scattered into\nthe loss cone by the tight curvature of the non-dipolar field\nlines. Lower onset latitudes indicate a larger polar cap and\nhence a more tail-like field. The observations suggest that\nsubstorm onset does not significantly increase the number of\nprecipitating protons above the level supplied by pitch angle\nscattering pre-onset.\nThe significant increase in brightness of the substorm\nbulge aurora with decreasing onset latitude, particularly in\nthe electron aurora, will affect the electrodynamics of the\nsubstorm process. High conductivities in the auroral bulge\nlead to a stagnation in the nightside ionospheric convection,\neffected through increased frictional coupling between en-\nhanced ionospheric electron and ion densities and the neutral\nbackground. Hence, high latitude substorms, being weak,\nwill be accompanied by prompt ionospheric convection in\nthe nightside in response to the closure of open magnetic\nflux (e.g. Grocott et al., 2002). Conversely, low latitude sub-\nstorms will display a more sluggish ionospheric convection\nresponse, even though the closure of open flux is expected to\nbe more pronounced.\nAs suggested by McPherron (1970), the substorm growth\nphase is the signature of accumulation of open flux by day-\nside reconnection. Our observations show that the increase\nin the size of the polar cap prior to onset is most rapid for\nlow latitude substorms, and these are also the substorms for\nwhich IMF BZ is most negative and the dayside reconnection\nrate 8D is greatest. Similar results have been reported by,\ne.g. Shukhtina et al. (2005). For instance, in our first study,\nthe level of dayside reconnection prior to onset increases\nfrom category i to category iv, from an average of 20\u201330 kV\nto an average of 100 kV. This explains the more dramatic ac-\ncumulation of open flux during the growth phase in the last\ncategory. A dayside reconnection rate of 100 kV should pro-\nduce 0.36 GWb of open flux in one hour, whereas 30 kV will\nproduce just 0.11 GWb in the same time, closely matching\nthe observed increase in open flux during the growth phases\nof categories i and iv (Fig. 1).\nWe find that after onset the midnight sector oval expands\npolewards as the substorm bulge develops (Fig. 5), indicating\nthe closure of open flux on the nightside by magnetotail re-\nconnection (see also, Fig. 1). However, the auroral oval can\ncontinue to progress equatorwards after onset at other local\ntimes (especially in the dawn sector), indicating that open\nflux can still continue to accumulate if the IMF conditions\nare favourable, as also noted by Coumans et al. (2007). We\nexpect that this continued equatorward motion will be more\nsignificant for low latitude onsets as the dayside reconnec-\ntion rate tends to be higher at these times, but also due to the\nstagnation of flows in the region of the auroral bulge, as dis-\ncussed above, which will impede the redistribution of open\nflux in the polar regions leading to a non-circular polar cap.\nAs discussed above, substorms are more intense the larger\nFPC at the time of onset. Why, then, does the magnetosphere\nsometimes allow the open flux to accumulate to large val-\nues before an intense substorm is triggered, whereas in other\ncases weak substorms are triggered at low levels of open\nflux? Milan et al. (2008) suggested that the presence of an\nintensified ring current introduced a significant BZ magnetic\ncomponent into the near-tail, stabilizing it to reconnection,\nrequiring an elevated amount of open flux in the system to\ntrigger substorm onset. Indeed, we find in both studies re-\nported in this paper that SYM-H is on average depressed at\nthe times of lower latitude onsets. As substorms themselves\ncontribute to the enhancement of the ring current, we suggest\nthat a feedback process may be able to operate while the day-\nside coupling rate remains high. If the ring current becomes\nintensified during strong solar wind driving conditions then\nmore open flux will accumulate prior to each substorm on-\nset, resulting in more intense substorms, which maintain an\nintensified ring current.\nFinally, we note that, on average, the WIC and SI12 au-\nrora are offset along the dawn-dusk meridian with respect\nto each other. The WIC oval is roughly symmetrical about\nthe noon-midnight meridian, whereas the SI12 oval is dis-\nplaced towards dusk by approximately 2\u25e6 of latitude, such\nthat the SI12 (WIC) oval is at lower latitude with respect to\nthe WIC (SI12) oval in the dusk (dawn) sector. A similar\noffset between WIC and SI12 observations has previously\nbeen reported by Mende et al. (2003). This pattern resembles\nAnn.

(2008).\n5 Summary\nSubstorms are more intense the greater the amount of open\nflux in the magnetosphere prior to onset, both in terms of the\nauroral brightness of the break-up aurora and the amount of\nopen flux closed during the substorm. The auroral brightness\nprior to substorm onset is also greater. In the case of pro-\nton aurora this is understood in terms of pitch angle scatter-\ning in the stretched tail field, with substorm expansion phase\nproducing only a modest increase in brightness over the pre-\nonset level. In the case of electron aurora, although the pre-\nonset brightness increases with open flux, the largest increase\nin brightness occurs with the onset of the expansion phase.\nAs substorm intensity is governed by the open flux content\nof the magnetosphere, it is germane to ask what controls the\nopen flux level at which a particular substorm is triggered.\nThe superposed epoch analyses of the solar wind conditions\nprior to onset suggest that the velocity and density are some-\nwhat elevated and that IMF BZ is most negative prior to low\nlatitude substorms; correspondingly the predicted dayside re-\nconnection rate is also elevated. These indicate that the accu-\nmulation of open flux during substorm growth phase is more\nrapid prior to low latitude onsets. However, it seems likely\nthat conditions internal to the magnetosphere must also sta-\nbilize the tail to substorm onset such that the open flux can\ngrow to large values before reconnection is triggered to re-\nclose it. The analyses presented indicate that low latitude on-\nsets occur when the ring current is enhanced (SYM-H is de-\npressed to low values), which will maintain a large BZ mag-\nnetic component in the near-Earth tail, inhibiting the onset of\nreconnection until the build-up of large amounts of open flux\nproduces a very stretched topology.\nThe present study comprises nearly 2000 substorms. This\nlarge number will allow our dataset to be further subdivided\ninto smaller categories and still maintain statistical signifi-\ncance. Hence, in future, we will be able to produce super-\nposed epoch analyses of the auroral evolution of substorms\nwhich will investigate the response to differing onset MLT\n(see Fig. 2b), or different geophysical conditions of interest,\nfor instance different orientations of IMF BY or different sea-\nsons.\nAcknowledgements.
