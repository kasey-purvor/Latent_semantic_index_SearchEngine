Thilakawardana, R.Tafazolli, B.G.Evans\nMobile Communications Research Group, Centre for Communications Systems Research,\nUniversity of Surrey,\nGU2 7XH Guildford, Surrey,\nUK\nAbstract- In this paper, we propose a cross-layer design\napproach using perfect prediction-based wireless channel\nconditions to improve the performance of a multicast packet\nscheduler over satellite network environments in the downlink\ntransmission. The satellite channels are modeled in single and\nmulti-environments with different values of Rician K factors and\nits corresponding elevation angle, mean and standard deviation\nvalues. From simulation results, the channel state information\n(CSI) of each user in the multicast group is considered and\nbecomes the condition for the transmission of the multicast\npacket. We assume the users suffer slow-varying channels such\nthat the CSI update is within the time interval for slot allocation.\nThe result indicates that a positive performance improvement is\ngained by adopting a cross-layer-design approach in a fading\nenvironment. By obtaining the CSI before transmitting multicast\nflows, the approach reduces unnecessary transmission of\nbackground traffic and hence reduces unnecessary resource\nallocation and retransmission requests.\nIndex Terms- cross-layer design, channel-state-information,\nmulticast scheduler, geo-stationary satellite networks\nI. INTRODUCTION\nR esearch on cross-layer design has recently attracted\nsignificant interest. It is concemed with adapting or\nharing of information among various layers as\nspecified in the open system interconnection (OSI) protocol\nlayers. There are a number of papers in the literature\naddressing specific cross-layer issues. In [1], channel variation\nand traffic burstiness is exploited to improve the performance\nof resource allocation. The merging of the two parameters has\nshown tremendous increase in network performance. Cross-\nlayer design mechanism can be easy and simple to implement,\nas discussed in [8]. The authors merge the scheduling\ninformation in medium access control (MAC) layer with rate\nselection in physical\/link (PHY\/LINK) layer. The mechanism\nis implemented by using one single bit ACK\/NACK signal\nindicating the correct reception\/failure of the packet in\ndownlink transmission. Another instance of a cross-layer\nscheduler that enjoys low-complexity implementation can be\nfound in [5]. The paper develops cross-layer design for\nmultiuser scheduling at the data link layer with each user\nemploying adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) at the PHY\nlayer. The scheduler classifies users in two categories: QoS\nguaranteed and best-effort. The scheduler has the capability to\nenable prescribed QoS guarantees and efficient bandwidth\nutilization simultaneously.\nSatellite networks offer the advantage of wide geographical\ncoverage. To model the satellite propagation channel, [2] uses\ntwo-level Markov state method. The propagation fading is\ntreated as slow fading (shadowing) and fast fading (multipath).\nTwo Markov state transition matrices are used to simulate the\nvariation in the strength of the received signal caused by\nshadowing or multipath fading. In [7], channel characterization\nfor mobile satellite communications is presented. The channel\nmodel is suitable for quasi-stationary channels, which is\nimplemented in this paper. Quasi-stationary channels are\ndefined as channels characterized by slowly varying\nenvironmental conditions.\nIn [3], it is indicated that the lack of channel state\ninformation in the satellite interface differentiates the packet\nscheduler in the satellite interface to its terrestrial counterpart.\nThe authors adapt weighted fair queuing (WFQ) and multi-\nlevel priority queuing (MLPQ) mechanisms for the time-\nscheduling function. The work has achieved significant results\nin terms of resource utilization achieved by the scheduler and\nperformance obtained by the flows at the packet level.\nIn multicast transmission, the delivery mechanism sends a\npacket to all multicast group users using one resource unit\ninstead ofN resource units to N users in unicast transmission.\nHowever, in multicast transmission even if one of the users in\na multicast group requests a retransmission due to bad channel\ncondition, the retransmission process has to be executed to all\nusers in the group. This scenario will exhaust the network\nresource. To reduce retransmission requests, we propose to\nadapt channel state information (CSI) as a conditional decision\nto resume packet transmission.\nIn this paper, we propose an adaptation of physical layer\nchannel state information onto the multicast packet scheduler\nat the MAC layer to improve network performance in a geo-\nstationary satellite system. We consider downlink transmission\nfrom the satellite to the multicast group users.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section II we present\nthe system architecture of the proposed multicast scheduler\nwith cross-layer design approach. The initial simulation\nresults are discussed in Section III. Finally we summarize our\ncurrent conclusion and propose future research direction in\nSection IV.\n0-7803-9206-X\/05\/$20.00 \u00a92005 IEEE\n701\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Multicast packet scheduling with channel state\ninformation\nThe adaptation of the proposed cross-layer design approach\nis based on sharing the channel status information from\nphysical layer with the multicast packet scheduler at the MAC\nlayer. Having access to this information the scheduler can\nmake the decision as to whether the channel is relatively\n'good' or 'bad' prior to resuming transmission. If a 'bad'\nchannel is predicted, the associated packet will be paused until\nit sees a 'good' channel status.\nThe system that we address in this paper handles fixed packet\nsize, 1, which is set to 1 25bytes in a TDMA environment and\neach TDMA slot is 20ms. We characterize two distinct classes\nof multicast service: streaming and file delivery.\nStreaming traffic, being non-delay tolerant, will always be\nallocated slots and transmitted to the users regardless of the\nchannel information. Thus only file delivery services, which\nare not delay-restricted, will be considered for channel-state-\ndependent scheduling. We summarize our scheduling policy as\nfollows:\nScheduling andAdmission Policy\n1) For each streaming traffic packet, time slots are\nallocated at all time.\n2) For the remaining slots, if file delivery traffic packets\narrive, channel state information (CSI) for the intended\nmulticast group is calculated.\n3) If CSI is above a certain threshold, the slot is allocated\nto that packet. If not, then the slot is allocated to another\nservice such as unicast.\nThe scheduling policy is illustrated in Figure 1. Referring\nto the figure, the channel state information for each receiver is\nobtained from the physical layer every 20ms for slot\nallocation. The algorithm to obtain the channel information is\nas follows:\nMulticast\ntraffic f\nservices j 7\nChannel state\ninformation\nulticast _ r__\nscheduler\n20ms\n125bytes\nFig. I Multicast scheduler with channel-state-dependence\n1) Channel level, si(t), for each multicast group user i is\ncalculated according to lognormal fading as defined in (1).\n2) This channel information corresponds to packet error\nrate (PERj) from lookup table obtained from a PER\nperformance reference curves [6].\n3) Threshold (PERthresh) for each receiver is established on\nthe strength of the fading at that particular instant,\naccording to packet error rate (PER) stated in Table 1. In\nthe simulation, file delivery service with PER 1 0-2 is\nassumed.\n4) Depending on comparison of PER; and PERhre.,h.ld, a\ndecision is made as to whether the channel is in 'good' or\n'bad' condition.\n5) The percentage of users in a multicast group, ;5,\nachieving PER higher than the threshold, 5T, is calculated.\n6) If the percentage, 5j, is greater than the specified\nthreshold, 45T, then the packet is selected for transmission\n7) If not, then the packet is delayed until percentage of\nusers with 'good' channel condition is achieved. Whilst the\npackets are delayed, the resource can be utilized by other\nservices such as unicast.\nNotice that our scheduler depends on both the queue state in\nterms of available slots for resource allocation at MAC layer,\nand the channel state at the physical layer. Hence, it offers\ncross-layer scheduler facilities.\nB. Traffic Modeling\nThe services considered for scheduling analysis are given in\nTable 1. For video streaming model, packet generation rate is\n64kbps for file size of 50kB. For background services, which\nis categorized as best effort traffic, generation rate is 32kbps\nand the file size is 100kB. The packet error rate (PER) for both\nservices are set to 10-2.\nTABLE I\nSERVICES AND TRAFFIC MODELS CONSIDERED IN SIMULATIONS\nPacket\nService Service type Traffic File error\ncategory model transfer rate\ndelay (PER)\nStreaming Video Generation 0.01 s I0-2\nstreaming rate 64kbps,\nfile size\n5okB\nFile Software Generation Is lo02\ndelivery distribution rate 32kbps,\nfile size\nI ookB\nC. Channel Model\nThe reference link level simulation curve, relating PER vs\nEb\/No is as given in [6]. The reference curve uses Turbo\ncoding, where the physical layer adaptation is observed and the\nperformance is reflected in PER employing a Rician channel\nwith K factor of between 0 and 7dB. The system employs\ntime-division multiple access (TDMA) and focuses on\ndownlink transmission, although our results can be extended to\nthe uplink transmission as well. Notably, the Rician channel is\nrepresentative of rural or suburban environments. In\ntransmitting file delivery services, the desired PER, which is\n10-2, can be achieved by Eb\/No values below the desired PER.\nThe entire Eb\/No values are partitioned into non-overlapping\nconsecutive intervals such that the range is fixed every 0.25dB.\n702\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Since the scheduler consideration is for non-delay\nsensitive service, this does not affect the performance of delay-\nsensitive traffic, such as streaming traffic.\nwhere A is the auto-correlation factor and Srandom_uncor is defined\nas\nSrandom_uncor = of x wgn(t) (3)\nwhere u is sigma and wgn(t) is white Gaussian noise random\ncoefficient.\nReferring to [11], single environment model uses values for\n,u and u calculated for urban areas with K factor of 7 and\nelevation angle a of 80\u00b0. The values are 1.7480 for ,u and 0.8\nfor . The auto-correlation factor, A, is set to 0.8 for both\nsingle and multi-environment. Whereas for multi-environment,\ndifferent values of K are reflected on specified mean and\nstandard deviation values, as will be discussed further in\nSection 111(b).\nNotably, it is assumed that the channel remains invariant per\npacket for each user. However the channel is allowed to vary\nfrom packet to packet. We also assume that perfect channel\nstate information (CSI) is available at the receiver. This\ninformation is fed back to the satellite without latency and\nerror.\nI1I. PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS AND CONCLUSION\nA. Single Environment\nOur goal here is to reduce the number of retransmission due\nto bad channel conditions. The initial result shown in Fig. 2\ndepicts the scheduler's performance for delay-tolerant traffic\nfrom file delivery service both with and without the\nemployment of cross-layer design. The figure is meant for\nvalidation and verification of the simulator as to whether the\nsimulator giving the correct result or not.\nHere, failure rate is calculated in terms of fraction of\nmulticast users in a multicast group requesting retransmission.\nThe failure rate is directly related to packet loss rate (PLR) due\nto bad channel condition. The packet loss rate is plotted over\nthe number of users in a multicast group. For cross layer\nscheduling the threshold fraction of users to resume\ntransmission, 5T, is 0.9 and 0.8. It is observed that by deploying\nchannel state information on a multicast packet scheduler, the\npacket loss rate is reduced significantly. This is because in the\nscheduler with channel information, the chosen packet has\nrelatively high percentage of 'good' channel condition. Thus\npacket loss due to bad channel condition is higher in scheduler\nwithout channel information compared to scheduler with\nchannel information. The behavior of PLR is almost constant\nwith multicast group size because the fraction of multicast\nusers in a group having bad channels is the same ratio and\ndirectly related to the target packet error rate. Furthermore, we\n0014\n0013\n0.012\n0- 0.011\nX, 001\nCA\na. 0.009\nm 0 008\n-EC- With CSI, zeta=0 8\nWithout CSI\nA With CSI, zeta=0.9\n---- Expected PLR\n- --\n0 007 k\n0.0061\n100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800\nMulticast group size\n900 1000\nFig. 2 Packet Loss Rate vs. multicast group size\nTo verify the expected packet loss rate (PLR), equation (13)\nin [9] is used:\nPLR=]-(1-Pa)(J-Po) (4)\nWhere Pd denotes packet dropping due to overflow or blocking\nprobability and P0 is the target PER which is set to 10-2 in this\npaper. Since we focus on the impact of shadowing in physical\nlayer, we assume there is no packet to be dropped due to\noverflow, i.e., Pd is 0.\nNow extending the investigations in the scope of cross-layer\nscheduling, the percentage threshold is varied to observe the\nperformance of the scheduler. Again in Fig. 2, it is observed\nthat lower value of ST (zeta), experiences higher packet loss\nrate. Increasing the threshold is not harmful since the\ntransmission is more guaranteed in this group than in groups\nwith low percentage threshold. As we take the probability of at\nleast one user request retransmission due to bad channel\ncondition, it is observed in Fig.3 that larger multicast group\nsizes suffer high probability of retransmission. The probability\nis defined as\nfnRtx>\n-\n=I)= nbad (5)\nwhere nbad is the number of bad channel events and N is the\ntotal number of events.\nThe increase of probability of retransmission with respect to\nmulticast group size occurs because the fraction of users in bad\nchannel conditions is linearly related to a multicast group size.\nFrom Fig. 3, it is shown that by increasing XT (zeta), the\n703\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Thus 5 becomes a\ncontrol parameter to monitor failure rate in certain multicast\ngroup size.\nHowever, by increasing 5T (zeta), the average packet delay is\nincreased. This is depicted in Fig. 4. The higher the\npercentage, the longer a multicast group has to wait for packets\nto be transmitted to them. Fig. 4 considers average packet\ndelay due to both delays waiting for slots as well as delay due\nto waiting for good channel condition,\nT= TCh +Tq (6)\nHowever, we assume the number of slots is infinite as we\nwant to show the impact exclusively on delay due to waiting\nfor achieving high fraction of users with good channel\ncondition only.\nB. Multi-channel Environment\nNext, we model different channel conditions to represent\ndifferent environments experienced by users in a multicast\ngroup. For each considered environment, by means of\nempirical models from [11], the optimum values for Rician\nfactor, K, mean, p, and standard deviation, a, as functions of\nelevation angle, a, are\nK=Ko+K1a+K2a2+K3a3\n, = , O+ \/ 1a+ ,u 2a2+ t 3a3\no = uo+ ula+ u2.2\u00b1+ Sf\n(7)\n(8)\n(9)\nThe coefficients are provided in Table II for considered\nenvironmental conditions.

The algorithm for multi-\nenvironment is the same as in single environment except that\ninstead of comparing the achieved PER with the target PER,\nwe now compare the achieved operating point, y i(t), with\nEb\/No threshold, y T-\nWith the mixture of environments in the scenario, the\nprobability of at least one user request retransmission is plotted\nvs. YT. The result is compared over fraction of users in\nrelatively good channel, ST (zeta). From Fig. 5, as YT increases,\nthe probability of retransmission decreases due to the high\nthreshold that each user has to meet in order to be considered\nfor transmission. Furthermore, higher 6T (zeta) experiences\nlower failure rate, reflecting a second threshold that the\nmulticast group has to meet prior to obtaining a slot from\nmulticast scheduler for downlink transmission.\nAs opposed to low probability of retransmission enjoyed in\nhigher values of YT, high average packet delay is expected as\nthe price to pay for waiting for a good fraction of users in the\ngroup, X;, having good channels, as depicted in Fig. 6. This is\nbecause, the packet intended for multicast group which does\nnot meet ;T in the first attempt, is retracted (back-off) and\nrepeated until it reaches gi higher than ;T.. The repeat\nmechanism increases the waiting time of the multicast packet.\nx 10'3\n26\n.~~~~~~~~~-9 zeta=-0 .9\n2,6:\\O zeta=0.8\n2.4\n2.2\n18\n1.4\n1.2\n1 1.5 2 25 3 35 4 4.5 5\nEb\/No threshold (dB)\nFig. 5 Probability of at least one user in a multicast group request\nretransmission (failure rate) vs. Eb\/No threshold, Y T\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis paper assumes single and multi-environment satellite\nchannels for downlink transmission of multicast packets with\ncross layer design mechanism. Channel state information (CSI)\nof each user in the multicast group is considered and becomes\nthe condition for the transmission of the multicast packets. The\nobservations are sustained in best effort traffic though the\nscenario simulates real-time traffic as well. The result indicates\nthat a positive performance improvement is gained by adopting\na cross-layer-design approach in fading environments.\nBy obtaining the CSI before transmitting multicast flows, the\napproach reduces unnecessary transmission of background\ntraffic and hence reduces unnecessary resource allocation and\nretransmission requests. However, to achieve a relatively good\nchannel condition for a multicast group, higher average packet\ndelay is expected. For further work, more accurate channel\nestimation to depict real-environments will be investigated for\nscheduling and transmission of multicast packets.\n1.\n1.6\n,E 1.4\n>1\nCL 12\n0.\n0.6\n0.4\nI'll\n1 2 3 4 5\nEb\/No threshold (dB)\n6 7\nFig. 6 Average packet delay vs. Eb\/No threshold, y T\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.
