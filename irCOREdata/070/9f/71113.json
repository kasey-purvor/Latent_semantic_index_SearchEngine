Cluster and Double Star provide observations of magnetotail dy- namics, while the corresponding auroral evolution, convec- tion response, and substorm current wedge development are monitored by IMAGE FUV, SuperDARN, and the Greenland magnetometer chain, respectively. The first stage of onset is associated with the reconnection of closed flux in the plasma sheet; this is accompanied by a short-lived auroral intensification, a modest substorm current wedge magnetic bay, but no significant ionospheric convection enhancement. The second stage follows the progression of reconnection to the open field lines of the lobes; accompanied by prolonged auroral bulge and westward-travelling surge development, enhanced magnetic bays and convection. We find that the tail dynamics are highly influenced by ongoing dayside creation of open flux, leading to flux pile-up in the near-tail and a step-wise down-tail motion of the tail reconnection site.

We examine magnetic flux closure during an ex-\ntended substorm interval on 29 August 2004 involving a\ntwo-stage onset and subsequent re-intensifications. Cluster\nand Double Star provide observations of magnetotail dy-\nnamics, while the corresponding auroral evolution, convec-\ntion response, and substorm current wedge development are\nmonitored by IMAGE FUV, SuperDARN, and the Greenland\nmagnetometer chain, respectively. The first stage of onset is\nassociated with the reconnection of closed flux in the plasma\nsheet; this is accompanied by a short-lived auroral intensifi-\ncation, a modest substorm current wedge magnetic bay, but\nno significant ionospheric convection enhancement. The sec-\nond stage follows the progression of reconnection to the open\nfield lines of the lobes; accompanied by prolonged auroral\nbulge and westward-travelling surge development, enhanced\nmagnetic bays and convection. We find that the tail dynamics\nare highly influenced by ongoing dayside creation of open\nflux, leading to flux pile-up in the near-tail and a step-wise\ndown-tail motion of the tail reconnection site. In all, 5 dipo-\nlarizations are observed, each associated with the closure of\n\u223c0.1 GWb of flux. Very simple calculations indicate that the\nX-line should progress down-tail at a speed of 20 km s\u22121, or\n6RE between each dipolarization.\nKeywords. Magnetospheric physics (Magnetotail; Solar\nwind-magnetosphere interactions; Storms and substorms)\n1 Introduction\nSubstorms are a key component of the cycle of capture and\nrelease of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) by the\nterrestrial magnetosphere, now known as the Dungey cycle\nCorrespondence to: S. E. Milan\n(steve.milan@ion.le.ac.uk)\n(Dungey, 1961), and the excitation of magnetospheric and\nionospheric convection (e.g. Cowley and Lockwood, 1992;\nLockwood and Cowley, 1992). Open magnetospheric field\nlines created by magnetic reconnection at the dayside magne-\ntopause accumulate in the magnetotail lobes and must even-\ntually be released by reconnection in the magnetotail neutral\nsheet. Current paradigms of substorm onset and evolution\ninvolve the development of a near-Earth neutral line (NENL)\nwhich must first reconnect already-closed magnetic flux of\nthe plasma sheet before the open flux of the magnetotail lobes\ncan be closed to complete the Dungey cycle (Hones et al.,\n1979). The pinched-off closed flux is observed as a plas-\nmoid ejected down-tail once the reconnection reaches lobe\nfield lines. Recent studies with Cluster suggest that plasmoid\nformation can occur within X= \u201319RE , placing the NENL\n(or multiple NENLs) somewhat closer to the Earth than pre-\nviously thought (Slavin et al., 2003).\nAt present, the amount of flux that is closed during sub-\nstorms, the duration of the delay from onset before the clo-\nsure of open flux, and the rate of reconnection are uncer-\ntain. Based on a limited sample, Milan et al. (2005) sug-\ngested that each magnetotail lobe contained approximately\n0.8 GWb of open flux prior to substorm onset, and that on\naverage 0.2\u20130.5 GWb of flux are closed during each sub-\nstorm, contributing to a magnetospheric flux throughput of\n3.5 GWb day\u22121, equivalent to an average cross polar cap po-\ntential drop of\u223c40 kV. This capture and release of interplan-\netary magnetic field lines provides the momentum, energy\nand mass input necessary to drive all magnetospheric dynam-\nics. The present paper examines in detail the flux transport\nduring a three-hour substorm interval on 29 August 2004.\nRecent studies (e.g. Slavin et al., 2002; Bora\u00a8lv et al., 2005)\nhave shown that combined observations of magnetotail dy-\nnamics and ionospheric responses are necessary to achieve a\nfuller understanding of substorm phenomena.

GSE X-Z and X-Y cuts through the magnetosphere, show-\ning field line traces through the T96 magnetic model. Shown\nalso are the Cluster and Double Star trajectories for the intervals\n18:00\u201312:00 UT, 28\u201329 August 2004, in the case of Cluster, and\n00:00\u201306:00 UT, 29 August 2004, in the case of Double Star. In\nboth cases, the highlighted portion of the trajectory indicates the in-\nterval 01:30 to 05:00 UT on 29 August, the period bracketing the\nsubstorm under consideration. In the bottom-left of each panel is\nthe tetrahedral configuration of Cluster at 03:00 UT, blown up by a\nfactor of 150.\nchanges in the open flux content of the magnetosphere are to\nbe investigated, which cannot be determined from spacecraft\nin the tail, then global auroral morphology and\/or convection\nmeasurements are required (e.g. Milan et al., 2003, 2006).\nIn this study, solar wind measurements are provided by\nthe ACE spacecraft (McComas et al., 1988; Smith et al.,\n1988; Stone et al., 1988), located near the L1 point. Mag-\nnetotail observations are provided by the Cluster (Escoubet\net al., 1997, 2001) and Double Star spacecraft missions, us-\ning the flux gate magnetometer (FGM, described by Balogh\net al., 1997, 2001) and the Hot Ion Analyser (HIA) com-\nponent of the Cluster Ion Spectrometry instrument (CIS,\ndescribed by Re`me et al., 1997, 2001). The ionospheric\ncurrents associated with the development of the substorm\ncurrent wedge are monitored by the Greenland magnetome-\nter array (e.g. Popov et al., 2001). In conjunction, simulta-\nneous views of the Northern Hemisphere convection pattern\nby the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN, de-\nscribed by Greenwald et al., 1995), and the Southern Hemi-\nsphere auroral emissions by the Far-Ultraviolet Imager (FUV,\ndescribed by Mende et al., 2000a, b) onboard the IMAGE\nspacecraft, allow the tail measurements to be placed within\nthe context of the overall evolution of the substorm. We be-\nlieve that an intensification of the auroral signature of the\nsubstorm \u223c20 min after initial onset marks the transition\nfrom reconnection of closed flux to reconnection of open\nlobe flux, with the attendant release of plasmoids observed\nby Cluster.\n2 Observations\nIn this section we provide a general overview of the inter-\nplanetary magnetic field measurements and corresponding\nmagnetotail dynamics for an extended 12-h period, and sub-\nsequently focus in on detailed observations of the tail and\nground observations of an isolated substorm.\n2.1 Overview: IMF and Cluster\nFigure 1 presents the orbital location of Cluster for the in-\nterval 18:00 UT, 28 August 2004, to 12:00 UT on the fol-\nlowing day. The position of Double Star TC1 is also shown,\nfor the period 00:00\u201306:00 UT, 29 August. Highlighted are\nthe portions of the orbits between 01:30 to 05:00 UT, the\nduration of the substorm we investigate in detail. Cluster is\nlocated approximately 16RE down-tail at this time, \u223c3RE\nabove the equatorial plane, and slightly dawnwards of the\nnoon-midnight meridian. Also at this time Double Star is\npassing outwards through geosynchronous orbit in the pre-\nmidnight sector. Meanwhile, Geotail (not shown) provides\nmeasurements of the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic\nfield (IMF) just upstream of the bow-shock. We find that both\nACE and Geotail provide extremely similar observations, as\nlong as a propagation delay of 60 min is applied to the ACE\ndata, consistent with the solar wind velocity of 350 km s\u22121.\nThe GSM Bz component of the IMF, lagged now to the mag-\nnetopause, can be seen in the bottom panel of Fig. 2. Prior to\n00:30 UT the IMF is mainly directed northwards; thereafter\na southward turning marks the onset of a substorm growth\nphase, as will be discussed below. This growth phase is\npaused briefly by a short return to northwards IMF (01:00\u2013\n01:15 UT), but after this time growth phase continues and\nexpansion phase onset occurs near 01:50 UT. The IMF re-\nmains southwards after onset, eventually turning northwards\nagain at 04:00 UT.\nPanels (a\u2013d) of Fig. 2 show the Bx , By , and Bz com-\nponents of the magnetic field, along with the total field\nAnn.

Also shown, in panels e and g, are the ion den-\nsity and X-component of the ion velocity measured by HIA.\nPanel f shows the plasma \u03b2, the ratio of the plasma to the\nmagnetic pressure, which helps distinguish between inter-\nvals when the spacecraft is located in the lobe, plasma sheet\nboundary layer (PSBL) or plasma sheet itself, in which (ap-\nproximately) \u03b2<0.1, 0.1<\u03b2<0.5, and \u03b2>0.5, respectively.\nThe plasma pressure, needed for the calculation of \u03b2, has\nbeen found from the HIA plasma density and temperature,\nin other words assuming that the pressure contribution from\nelectrons is small.\nPrior to 20:00 UT the magnetic field is dominated by a\npositive Bx component, consistent with the spacecraft being\nlocated in the northern lobe, thoughBx andBT are somewhat\ndepressed below the T96 expectation. The observed ion den-\nsities of \u223c0.02 cm\u22123 and \u03b2 of \u223c10\u22123 are typical of the lobe.\nBx and the total field strength fall with time as the spacecraft\nmoves further from the Earth. At 20:45 UT there is a small\nincrease in theBz component of the magnetic field, indicative\nof a transition from a stretched tail-like field to a more dipo-\nlar field, a common signature of substorm onset (e.g. Hepp-\nner, 1967; Fairfield and Ness, 1970); this \u201cdipolarization\u201d is\nmarked by a vertical dashed line. Approximately 30 min after\nthis dipolarization the ion density increases to \u223c0.05 cm\u22123\nand \u03b2 exceeds 2\u00d710\u22122, suggesting that the plasma sheet (or\nboundary layer) has expanded northward over the spacecraft\nin response to the substorm onset.\nAfter the southward turning of the IMF at 00:40 UT\n(marked by a vertical dot-dashed line) the ion density falls\nand a progressive increase in the Bx and BT field compo-\nnents are observed. The increase in field strength represents\na build-up of open flux in the magnetotail in response to day-\nside low latitude magnetopause reconnection occurring with\nthe southward-directed IMF, the substorm \u201cgrowth phase\u201d\n(McPherron et al., 1973). The enlargement of the lobe causes\nthe tail magnetopause to flare outwards, such that the imping-\ning solar wind applies a greater normal stress, which must be\nstood-off by enhanced magnetic pressure in the lobes (e.g.\nSlavin et al., 2002, and references therein). This enhanced\nmagnetic pressure in the lobes in turn presses inwards on\nthe plasma sheet, which is compressed until the gas pres-\nsure reaches equilibrium. This \u201cplasma sheet thinning\u201d or\n\u201cdrop-out\u201d (e.g. Bame et al., 1967; McPherron and Manka,\n1985; Fairfield, 1988) results in Cluster returning to the lobe\nby 01:05 UT, as indicated by the decrease in ion density and\n\u03b2 at Cluster.\nThe increase in lobe field strength thereafter continues,\nthough detailed examination shows that it pauses during\nthe brief northwards turning of the IMF between 01:00 and\n01:20 UT, indicating a cessation of dayside reconnection at\nthis time. After continued lobe build-up, a second dipolar-\nization is observed in Bz at 02:20 UT (second vertical dotted\nFig. 2.

As\nwith the first substorm, the ion densities at Cluster increase\nabove lobe values approximately 30 min after the dipolariza-\ntion. Subsequently, a further dipolarization (marked D5) is\nseen near 04:15 UT.\nEventually, Cluster moves down into the central plasma\nsheet and crosses the neutral sheet, as indicated by the\nincrease in the ion density (\u03b2>0.5) and the transition from\na positive to a negative Bx field component (\u223c09:00 UT).\nIn what follows, we will concentrate on the observations\nduring the second substorm, first describing the Cluster and\nDouble Star measurements in the near-tail in more detail, and\nthen the associated auroral morphology and ionospheric con-\nvection response.\n2.2 Magnetotail: Cluster and Double Star\nWe now focus on the time interval leading up to and encom-\npassing the second substorm, 01:30 to 05:00 UT, the interval\nhighlighted on the spacecraft trajectories in Fig. 1. At the\nstart of this interval the Double Star TC1 spacecraft was out-\nbound through geosynchronous orbit, and reached a down-\ntail distance of X=11RE by the end, traversing 4RE during\nthe three hours. In Fig. 3 we present the Bx andBz compo-\nnents as measured by TC1 for this interval; as before red dot-\nted lines show T96 predictions of the magnetic field. Shown\nalso are the Cluster 1 Bx andBz components already shown\nin Fig. 2, along with Vx and Ni . Five vertical lines indicate\napproximate times of magnetic field dipolarizations which\nwill described below; these are designated D1\u2013D5, and will\nbe shown in subsequent figures, also. At the start of the inter-\nval, Cluster sees an increasing Bx component, indicating flux\nbuild-up in the tail, followed by a dipolarization observed in\nBz at 02:18 UT (D1). At this time, Ni remains low, indicat-\ning that C1 remains in the lobe. However, after 02:42 UT\nthere are episodic enhancements of Ni , specifically at 02:42,\n03:18, and 03:33 UT (these times correspond approximately\nto D2, D3, and D4). These are associated with transient dia-\nmagnetic depressions in Bx (and the total field magnitude).\nThese indicate that the plasma sheet thickens periodically to\nengulf the spacecraft. After 03:45 UT the Bz component of\nthe field gradually decreases, becoming more tail-like and\napproaching the T96 prediction by 04:00 UT. Finally, we\nidentify a small increase in Bz near 04:15 UT as D5.\nThe corresponding TC1 measurements indicate that the\nspacecraft is located south of the neutral sheet during this\nperiod, as Bx is negative. Increasing (in magnitude) Bx and\ndecreasing Bz after 02:00 UT suggest the development of a\nmore tail-like magnetic field configuration during the sub-\nstorm growth phase, in line with the increasing Bx seen at\nC1. At the time of the first dipolarization observed by C1\n(D1), TC1 also observes a gradual return of the magnetic\nfield to a more dipolar orientation over 10 min or so. Sub-\nsequently, however, sudden dipolarizations are observed at\n02:45, 03:16, and 03:36 UT (D2, D3, and D4), correspond-\ning to the entries into the plasmasheet of C1. Thereafter, Bz\nrelaxes to a more tail-like value, approaching the T96 predi-\ncation by 04:00 UT, mirroring a similar behaviour observed\nat C1. In summary, following the initial substorm onset (D1)\nthere are subsequent dipolarizations (D2\u2013D4) observed at\nTC1 at the same time that further down-tail the plasma sheet\nthickens to engulf C1.\nAnn.

X-component magnetograms from the Greenland West\nCoast magnetometer chain for the interval 01:30 to 05:00 UT,\n29 August 2004.\nIn addition to these large-scale features, many signatures\nof small-scale flux ropes in the plasma sheet are seen. The\ntop panel of Fig. 4 shows the Bz measurements from C1 for\nthe interval 01:45 to 03:45 UT, with D1 to D4 indicated by\nvertical dotted lines. Marked by thin vertical lines are the\ntimes at which flux ropes are identified. The bottom four\npanels show a blow-up of the period 02:18 to 02:25 UT, with\nmagnetic field measurements from all four Cluster space-\ncraft. The signatures seen during this period are typical of\nall the events identified. As described by Slavin et al. (2003,\n2005), the plasma sheet flux ropes are identified as com-\npressions of the overlying lobe (in which Cluster is located),\nthat is local enhancements in Bx and BT , known as travel-\nling compression regions (TCRs). Accompanying these are\nnegative-then-positive bipolar excursions of Bz due to the\ndraping of the field over the plasma sheet bulge; the sense\nof the excursions is indicative of earthward propagation of\nthe flux ropes. In By the events are seen as positive-then-\nnegative bipolar signatures. As Cluster is located dawnwards\nof the noon-midnight meridian this might indicate that the\nbulge of the plasma sheet is greatest near the centre of the\ntail. In all, 30 events are identified, though this will represent\nonly a subset of the total, as these signatures can only be ob-\nserved when Cluster is located away from the plasma sheet.\nSlavin et al. (2003, 2005) interpreted multiple observations\nof flux ropes in the near-tail as an indication of the forma-\ntion of multiple X-lines. It would appear, then, that multiple\nX-lines are a feature of the tail throughout the substorm de-\nvelopment.\n2.3 Ionosphere: Greenland magnetometers, IMAGE FUV\nand SuperDARN\nX-component magnetograms from stations of the Greenland\nWest Coast magnetometer chain, which was located in the\nmidnight sector during the interval of interest, are presented\nin Fig. 5, in order of increasing latitude, spanning the mag-\nnetic latitude range 66 to 76\u25e6. Each magnetogram is offset by\n200 nT for clarity. Vertical lines are shown at the same times\nas in Fig. 3. The observations show the onset of a \u223c120 nT\nnegative bay, associated with the development of a westward\ncurrent, at the four lowest latitude stations at 02:20 UT, the\ntime of the first dipolarization (D1). The negative excursion\nbecomes more pronounced after 02:40 UT (D2), especially at\nFHB, where the bay eventually exceeds 400 nT in depth. At\nsubsequent dipolarizations, bays appear at ever-higher lati-\ntude stations, at ATU after D3 and at ATU and GDH after D4.\nFurther excursions are seen at all stations after the last dipo-\nlarization D5, but that at SKT is of greatest amplitude. This\nlast event differs from the previous bays in that the magne-\ntograms suggest a smaller scale current system than before.\nThese observations represent the development and evolution\nof the substorm current wedge (SCW), the dawn-dusk cross-\ntail current being diverted through upwards and downwards\nfield aligned currents in the pre- and post-midnight sectors,\nand closing through a westwards electrojet in the ionosphere\n(McPherron et al., 1973). The poleward step-wise motion of\nthe magnetogram bays indicates a step-wise development of\nthe SCW, the steps occurring at the times of the dipolariza-\ntions observed in the tail.\nAuroral observations of the Southern Hemisphere by IM-\nAGE FUV are available from \u223c01:30 UT onwards, and\nFig. 6 shows selected Wideband Imaging Camera (WIC) im-\nages from the development of the substorm.

An FUC\/WIC auroral snapshot from 03:01 UT (Fig. 6g),\nsuperimposed on which are contours of auroral brightness observed\nby the (a) SI13 and (b) SI12 channels of FUV, sensitive to electrons\nand protons, respectively.\nbelow, the definition of \u201cdim\u201d is determined by camera sen-\nsitivity; 2) the coverage of the WIC camera only allows FPC\nto be determined after \u223c01:45 UT; 3) there are certain ambi-\nguities in the pointing information relating to the FUV mea-\nsurements on this day, and the values of FPC are subject to\nsome uncertainty. Having said this, these measurements of\nFPC are a useful qualitative indicator of the rates of creation\nand destruction of open flux by reconnection on the dayside\nand in the magnetotail.\nThe observations start during the growth phase of the sub-\nstorm. At this time the auroral oval is dim but is moving\nto lower latitudes as the polar cap expands, FPC increas-\ning from 0.6 GWb at 01:45 UT to 0.75 GWb by 02:10 UT.\nWe previously deduced this increase in the open flux content\nof the magnetosphere during the growth phase from the in-\ncrease in magnetic field strength at Cluster (Sect. 2.1). Tran-\nsient, short-lived brightenings of the nightside oval, e.g. pan-\nels (a\u2013c) of Fig. 6, are observed prior to the main onset\nshown in panel (d) at\u223c02:20 UT, associated with D1. This is\nmarked by a considerable brightening of the oval and the de-\nvelopment of an auroral bulge. After this time, our deduced\nvalue of FPC remains relatively uniform until 04:00 UT, after\nwhich it begins to decrease.\nAfter the initial onset at 02:20 UT, the brightness of the\nbulge decreases rapidly, so that by 02:38 UT (panel e), it has\nreturned to almost pre-onset levels, though the bulge remains\nvisible. However, the bulge then suddenly re-intensifies at\n02:40 UT (D2). Thereafter, the brightness slowly declines\nover the next 2.5 h. During this time the auroral bulge shows\na slow westwards progression, the main aurora focussed\nat the westward end to form a westwards-travelling surge\n(WTS), panels (f\u2013k). During this time there are a few\nother occasions of note, such as a re-intensification of the\nwhole polewards edge of the auroral bulge at 03:34 UT\n(D4 and panel j) in what has been described as a poleward\nboundary intensification (PBI, Lyons et al., 1999), and a re-\nintensification of the surge head after 04:10 UT (D5 and\npanel k).\nBefore moving on, we remark briefly on an interesting\nobservation. The WIC luminosities of Fig. 6 contain con-\ntributions from both ion and electron precipitation. Other\nFUV channels, SI12 and SI13, allow us to discriminate be-\ntween ions and electrons, respectively. SI12 is sensitive to\nthe Doppler-shifted Lyman \u03b1 emissions from down-going\nhydrogen atoms, that is, precipitating protons which have\ncharge-exchanged during their passage through the atmo-\nsphere; there is no contamination from electron aurora. SI13,\non the other hand, is sensitive to OI emission at 135.6 nm pro-\nduced by precipitating electrons, though there may be some\nsmall contamination from secondary-electrons produced by\nprecipitating protons. Panels (a\u2013b) of Fig. 7 both reproduce\nthe same WIC snapshot (03:01 UT) from Fig. 6g, typical of\nthe observations from the development and evolution of the\nWTS. Superimposed on Figs. 7a and b are contours of pho-\nton flux observed by SI13 (mainly electrons) and SI12 (ions),\nrespectively. We see that the WTS is associated with a rela-\ntively restricted region of electron precipitation, whereas the\nremainder of the auroral bulge to the east is associated with a\nmore distributed ion precipitation region. We speculate that\nthe ions and electrons represent the charge carriers in the\ndownwards and upwards field-aligned current (FAC) regions\nassociated with the substorm current wedge, described in re-\nlation to the Greenland magnetometer signatures of Fig. 5.\nThe upward FAC at the western edge of the bulge has been\ndescribed before (e.g. Amm et al., 2001), but the location of\nthe closed FAC is still under debate.\nNext we present SuperDARN observations of the iono-\nspheric convection flow in the Northern Hemisphere in\nFig. 8. Panels (a\u2013d) show four snapshots of the flow in a\nmagnetic latitude and MLT frame, whereas the lower panel\npresents the time-series of cross-polar cap potential 8PC de-\ntermined from the convection observations between 01:30\nand 05:00 UT. Individual snapshots of the flow are produced\nby compiling 2-min averages of line-of-sight Doppler veloc-\nity observations from 8 Northern Hemisphere radars, which\nare then used to constrain the solution of an order 6 spherical\nharmonic expansion of the potential pattern, using the tech-\nnique of Ruohoniemi and Baker (1998). The vectors indicate\nthe locations of radar observations that contributed to the po-\ntential solution; the length and colour of these is related to the\nflow speed. Where data are sparse, an IMF-driven empirical\nconvection model is usually employed to further constrain\nthe potential pattern. In this study we want to ensure that the\nAnn.

Contours\nshow the resulting potential pattern, solid and dashed con-\ntours for negative and positive potentials, respectively, with\na contour spacing of 6 kV. 8PC is defined as the difference\nbetween the minimum and maximum of the potential, the lo-\ncations of which are indicated by crosses.\nAs the coverage of the polar region by radar observations\nis somewhat sparse, the use of the neutral IMF model means\nthat we may underestimate the true value of 8PC somewhat;\nhowever, good coverage of the dusk sector return flow means\nthat variations in the strength of the convection pattern will\nbe captured in form, if not in total magnitude. At the start\nof the interval shown, antisunwards flow across the polar cap\nand return flow is slow, resulting in 8PC of \u223c30 kV. Around\n01:50 UT, panel (a), a small enhancement in flows near mid-\nnight gives a small enhancement in 8PC . After 02:00 UT,\nthere is a strengthening of the dusk sector return flow, but\nthis contributes to only a modest increase in 8PC . 8PC rises\nmost dramatically, to \u223c50 kV, after D2, due to a further en-\nhancement of the return flow in both dawn and dusk sectors.\nThereafter, 8PC gradually decreases to 30 kV by 05:00 UT,\nthough with enhancements apparent at 03:25 (after D3) and\nmaybe 03:45 UT (after D4). Hence, dipolarizations D2 to\nD4 are each followed by a \u223c15-min burst of strengthened\nconvection.\n3 Discussion\nWe have presented observations of the development and evo-\nlution of an auroral substorm, with Cluster and Double Star\nlocated in the magnetotail, and a variety of ground-based sta-\ntions measuring convection and current signatures. However,\neven before substorm onset, interesting small-scale features\nare observed in the aurora and in the tail, and we describe\nthese first.\n3.1 Auroral brightenings (pseudo-breakups) prior to first\nonset\nPrior to substorm onset, during the on-going growth phase,\ntransient dynamic processes are taking place in the tail,\nwhich might be classified as pseudo-breakups. Figure 9 fo-\ncuses on C1 measurements of Bz and the auroral luminos-\nity observations from 01:30 to 02:30 UT. Three brief and\nlow magnitude dipolarizations (arrows in panel a) can be\nseen at 01:41, 02:01, and 02:09 UT before the main on-\nset dipolarization (D1) at 02:19 UT. As suggested in Fig. 4,\nthe two events at 02:00 and 02:10 UT can be interpreted as\nearthward-moving flux ropes. Each of the three events is ac-\ncompanied by a transient enhancement of the auroral lumi-\nnosity (arrows in panel b), each also shown in panels (a\u2013c) of\nFig. 6. These auroral bursts are relatively localized in nature\nand each appear at slightly different local times within a 3-\nh wide MLT sector, though still each produce an observable\nsignature at Cluster. The exact location of the bursts relative\nto the local time meridian of Cluster is difficult to determine\ndue to uncertainties in the FUV pointing at this time. How-\never, it seems reasonable to suggest that the first two bright-\nenings occur at least 2\u20133 h of MLT to the west of Cluster.\nTherefore, although the brightenings are localized in nature\nin the ionosphere, they produce signatures across a reason-\nable fraction of the width of the magnetotail. Similar be-\nhaviour has previously been reported by Reeves et al. (1990,\n1991).\n3.2 Substorm development and evolution\nTo synthesize the observations of the substorm into a coher-\nent picture, we bring together the most salient observations\nin Fig. 10. Thus, we present again the C1 measurements of\n(a) Bx , (b) Bz, (c) Ni , and (d) Vx , and (e) TC1 measurements\nof Bz; panels (f\u2013i) show Imax , FPC , 8PC , and the FHB X-\ncomponent magnetogram; finally, panel (j) shows IMF Bz.\nVertical lines, as before, indicate the times of dipolarizations.\nThis figure will form the basis of the following discussion.\nExamination of Fig. 10 allows the substorm development to\nbe described as follows. The initial onset of the substorm\nas observed in the auroral and magnetometer data is coinci-\ndent with the first dipolarization seen in Bz by C1 and TC1 at\n\u223c02:20 UT (D1). However, even after the initial onset, with\nits dipolarization and the formation of an auroral bulge, C1\nremains in the lobe and there is no enhancement in 8PC .\nAt the time of the re-intensification at 02:40 UT (D2), the\nion density at C1 suddenly increases, indicating an expansion\nof the plasma sheet northwards over Cluster. This expansion\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 751\u2013767, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/751\/2006\/\nS. E. Milan et al.: Flux closure during a substorm 761\nof the plasma sheet is accompanied by two short positive ex-\ncursions in Bz, and ion velocities measured at this time are\ndirected away from the Earth, down the tail, at a speed of\n\u223c75 km s1. Shortly afterwards TC1 sees a dipolarization. At\nthe same time, 8PC is observed to increase markedly, and\nthen to remain elevated for the duration of the substorm au-\nroral display. Subsequent dipolarizations at TC1 (D3 and\nD4) are also each followed by a plasma sheet entry by C1,\nobserved in both Bx and Ni , and are also associated with\n10\u201315-min enhancements in8PC . Although there is no clear\nresponse in the aurora at dipolarization D3, dipolarization D4\ncorresponds to the intensification of the poleward boundary\nof the auroral bulge (PBI) shown in Fig. 6j.\nBy 04:00 UT the southward component of the IMF has\nreduced, and it would appear that the reduction in Bz ob-\nserved by both C1 and TC1 occurs in response to this, sug-\ngesting that the tail dynamics up until this point have been to\nsome degree driven by continued loading of the lobes with\nnew open flux. Despite the reduction in this driving after\n04:00 UT, an auroral re-activation occurs at 04:12 UT in re-\nsponse to a dipolarization observed at C1 (D5), and the re-\nduction in FPC after this time would suggest that tail recon-\nnection is still ongoing, though 8PC is decreasing in magni-\ntude. After this time, C1 makes further encounters with the\nplasma sheet. There are no clear signatures observed by TC1\nat this time, and so we will not concentrate on this interval in\ngreat detail.\n3.3 Open flux, reconnection rates, and transpolar voltage\nChanges in FPC can be used to infer the dayside and night-\nside reconnection rates, 8D and 8N , respectively, as dis-\ncussed by Milan et al. (2003, 2006):\ndFPC\ndt\n= 8D \u22128N .\nThe increase in FPC between 01:45 and 02:10 UT, 0.15 GWb\nin 25 min, indicates a dayside reconnection rate of \u223c100 kV,\nassuming that no significant tail reconnection occurs at this\ntime. This corresponds to the interval when the lobe field\nstrength as measured at C1 is also increasing. After D1, FPC\nremains constant until \u223c04:00 UT, despite the IMF remain-\ning southward during this period with anticipated continued\ndayside production of open flux. That is, the closure of mag-\nnetic flux by reconnection in the tail must proceed at a rate\nsimilar to the addition of open flux to the magnetosphere by\nreconnection at the dayside. In other words, 8D and 8N\nare roughly equal. This is also consistent with the obser-\nvations of Bx by C1 during this period: after D1 the field\nstrength decreases with time, though this decrease is in step\nwith the field prediction of T96 and hence is most likely re-\nlated to a spatial variation as C1 moves further from the Earth\nwith time, rather than a temporal variation. In other words it\nwould appear that the magnetic pressure in the lobe remains\nuniform with time, suggesting that the lobe flux content is\nFig. 10. An amalgam of observations from ground and space.

Geophys., 24, 751\u2013767, 2006\n762 S. E. Milan et al.: Flux closure during a substorm\nalso constant. We can also show rough consistency between\nthe open flux estimates from the two measurements: if each\nlobe can be considered as a semi-circle of radius 20RE at the\ndown-tail distance of C1, then the lobe field strength of 27 nT\nas measured at 02:15 UT translates to 0.7 GWb of open flux,\nclose to the value of FPC calculated at this time.\nThe rate of flux closure during the substorm is difficult\nto know exactly; as FPC remains roughly uniform, then\n8N\u22488D , but if we wish to quantify 8N then this requires\nthat we know 8D . This appears to be \u223c100 kV before sub-\nstorm onset, but is likely to decrease shortly afterwards as\nIMF Bz changes from \u20133.5 nT to \u20132 nT. If the reconnection\nrate is proportional to Bz (e.g. Milan et al., 2006) then 8D\n(and consequently 8N ) is expected to fall to \u223c70 kV.\nAs discussed by Milan (2004) and references therein, the\ntransport of open flux across the polar cap, quantified by the\ncross polar cap potential 8PC , should approximate to the\nmean of the dayside and nightside reconnection voltages:\n8PC = 12 (8D +8N ) .\nIn this case, we would expect that 8PC\u224850 kV prior to sub-\nstorm onset, when 8D\u2248100 kV and 8N\u22480 kV; after on-\nset, when 8D\u22488N\u224870 kV, we expect 8PC\u224870 kV; after\nthe cessation of dayside reconnection once the IMF turned\nnorthwards, and assuming that tail reconnection continues\nunabated at 8N\u224870 kV, we expect 8PC\u224835 kV. The time-\nseries of 8PC derived from the radar measurements, we con-\ncluded above, underestimates the true cross-polar cap poten-\ntial due to the lack of coverage in the dawn sector. However,\nthe observed variation does reflect the expected changes,\nvarying from 35 kV before onset to 50 kV after onset, to\n35 kV after the northward turning of the IMF.\nIf we speculate that the dipolarizations represent bursts\nof tail reconnection, then at an average reconnection rate of\n70 kV, with a repetition period of \u223c30 min, each burst closes\nof order 0.125 GWb of flux.\n3.4 Nightside reconnection of closed or open flux?\nImmediately after the development of the main NENL, which\nwe suggest occurs at the first dipolarization D1, reconnection\nmust occur between closed plasma sheet field lines. This\nprocess is not thought to occur very efficiently due to the\nhigh plasma \u03b2 of the dense, hot plasma sheet. Due to the\nrelatively low efficiency of this process, the process slows\nquickly and the attendant auroral signature fades sharply.\nNewly-reconnected field lines relax Earthwards to increase\nthe density of dipolar-like field lines in the near-Earth tail,\nleading to the dipolarization observed at TC1 after D1. Tail-\nwards of the X-line newly-reconnected field lines accumulate\nto begin formation of a plasmoid. However, as no open flux\nis closed, there is little rearrangement of the flux in the tail,\nso no significant convection is excited. However, the recon-\nnection does remove closed field lines from the vicinity of\nthe neutral line relieving the build-up of pressure in the lobe\n(and hence Bx at C1 stops increasing at D1).\nIf this is the case, then the initial formation of the auroral\nbulge and poleward motion of the luminosity after D1 must\noccur on closed field lines, though we have until now as-\nsumed that all the dim portion poleward of the pre-substorm\noval was open. In other words, there is a region of dim,\nclosed field lines poleward of the main pre-onset auroral\noval. We assume, then, that these closed field lines stretch\na long distance down-tail and do not contain much plasma.\nSub-visual precipitation on closed field lines poleward of the\nmain nightside auroral luminosity have previously been re-\nported by Mende et al. (2003), and the possible existence\nof such a region was suggested as an uncertainty in measur-\ning FPC from auroral observations by Milan et al. (2003).\nIn the present case, then, our estimate of FPC prior to sub-\nstorm onset will have been an overestimate, by slightly less\nthan 0.1 GWb (the flux contained within the bulge that devel-\nops between D1 and D2). This will be discussed further in\nSect. 3.7.\nWe conclude, then, that the second dipolarization (D2)\nrepresents the transition from reconnection of closed field\nlines to the reconnection of open field lines. This occurs in\ntandem with an increase in 8PC , enhanced and prolonged\nauroral luminosities, and, we expect, the release of a plas-\nmoid. Figure 11 focuses on the FGM observations from all\nfour Cluster spacecraft for the period surrounding D2. At\n02:42:30 UT, C1, C2, and C4 observe a \u223c1 nT enhance-\nment in BT lasting \u223c45 s; a similar signature at C3 lasts\nonly \u223c15 s. After 02:44:15 UT, all four spacecraft observe\nanother enhancement in BT , though with a brief dip in the\ncentre of the event. Both events also involve a \u223c2 nT in-\ncrease in Bz and a similar decrease in By . We interpret these\nas the signatures of plasmoid release, observed as travelling\ncompression regions (TCRs) in the lobe (e.g. Slavin et al.,\n2002, 2003); these events are considerably larger than the\nsmall flux rope signatures examined in Fig. 4. The increase\nin total field strength is associated with a bulge in the plasma\nsheet compressing the overlying lobe field lines, and the re-\norientation of By and Bz is due to draping over the bulge.\nCareful comparison of CIS\/HIA densities and temperatures\nfrom C1 and C3 for this interval reveals that in association\nwith the first event C3 briefly entered the PSBL, in associa-\ntion with the early decrease in BT . During the second event,\nboth entered the PSBL, again during the dip in BT . This\nsuggests that during the first plasmoid event C1, C2, and C4\nobserved the TCR in the lobe, whereas C3, located nearest\nthe equatorial plane (see inset in Fig. 1 for the tetrahedral\nconfiguration at this time), entered the high density plasmoid\nitself. In the second event, all four spacecraft saw the field\nenhancement in the lobe, and then all four entered the plas-\nmoid at the time of passage of the thickest point of the bulge.\nFinally, after 02:48 UT, there is a 4-nT reduction in BT of\n1-min duration observed by all four spacecraft. We interpret\nthis as the passage of a third plasmoid by which all spacecraft\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 751\u2013767, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/751\/2006\/\nS. E.

The nested nature of the four traces during this event\nsuggests that the bulge advances from below and duskwards\nof the Cluster constellation, and subsequently retreats back\nin the same direction. This may suggest that the bulge is\nthickest near the noon-midnight meridian of the tail.\n3.5 Location of X-line\nThe observation of several plasmoids in the 5 min or so fol-\nlowing D2, together with the presence of many flux ropes\npreceding and following this, suggests that by this time\nmultiple X-lines have formed in the near-tail, consistent\nwith previous interpretations (e.g. Slavin et al., 2003, 2005).\nFig. 12. Total magnetic field strength BT from all four Cluster\nspacecraft for the intervals (a) 03:15 to 03:30 UT, and (b) 03:30\nto 03:55 UT, 29 August 2004.\nUnfortunately, the four-spacecraft FGM observations do not\nallow a very straightforward determination of the direction\nof propagation, tailwards or Earthwards, of the plasmoids\ndescribed in Sect. 3.4. However, the small-scale flux ropes\nappear consistently to move earthwards, suggesting that the\nmain active X-line is tailward of Cluster. On the other hand,\nthe ion moments in the PSBL encounters around the time of\nD2 indicate tailward plasma motion, which would seem to\nsuggest that the X-line is located earthward of the tetrahe-\ndron. Due to the inconsistency of these signatures, we hesi-\ntate to draw a firm conclusion as to the location of the X-line\naround the time of D2.\nLater dipolarizations, especially D3 and D4, are followed\nby deeper entries of Cluster into the plasma sheet, as evi-\ndenced by the higher densities and deeper reductions in Bx\nobserved for longer periods of time. This may be in part due\nto its approach of the equatorial plane as Cluster continues in\nits orbit, which appears to reduce the sensitivity to multiple\nplasmoid features as seen following D2. However, the char-\nacteristics of the plasma sheet encounter of D3 and D4 are\ninvestigated in Figs. 12a and b, respectively. D3 is nested in a\nsimilar manner to the third event following D2, but the details\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/751\/2006\/ Ann. Geophys., 24, 751\u2013767, 2006\n764 S. E. Milan et al.: Flux closure during a substorm\nof the entrance to and exit from the plasma sheet by the four\nspacecraft suggest that the bulge grows from below and then\npropagates towards dawn. Ion moments reveal earthwards\nstreaming plasma at the crossings of the PSBL as Cluster\nenters and exits the bulge. We are confident that the active\nX-line is now tailward of Cluster.\nThe plasma sheet encounter after D4 is different again\n(Fig. 12b), having a less nested appearance and indicating\nthat C2 and C3 enter deeper into the plasma sheet than C1\nand C4. This again suggests that the bulge is thickest near\nthe noon-midnight meridian. Ion velocities are again directed\nearthwards during this encounter, indicating that reconnec-\ntion occurs tailward of Cluster.\nWe expect the location to the main tail X-line to progress\ndown-tail with time, as previously suggested by Hones\n(1979). Indeed, the motion of the X-line has been suggested\nto jump in a step-wise fashion, a new X-line forming in the\nneutral sheet each time further down-tail than the previous X-\nline. This is accompanied by poleward steps in the SCW cur-\nrent system observed by the ground magnetometers at each\ndipolarization, indicating new open flux is closed at each\nstep. It is interesting to note that following the sudden dipo-\nlarization of the field at Cluster at D1, the field continues to\nbecome more dipolar with time, Bz further increasing and Bx\nfurther decreasing with respect to the T96 predictions, until\nabout 03:45 UT when the IMF turns northwards (Figs. 10a\nand b). The same is true of the field at TC1 (Fig. 10e). We\ninterpret this as continued and increasing magnetic flux pile-\nup in the tail near TC1 and Cluster following substorm onset.\nThis pile-up should be relieved by the convection of closed\nfield lines from the nightside to the dayside, and indeed the\ntranspolar voltage is elevated throughout this period. How-\never, the convection is clearly not sufficiently rapid to remove\nflux from the pile-up region as quickly as it is added by re-\nconnection at the X-line, which itself is continuously being\nsupplied by new open flux due to on-going dayside recon-\nnection. This sluggish convection may be a consequence of\nelevated ionospheric conductance in the region of the auroral\nbulge, and the associated frictional coupling with the neutral\natmosphere. For this reason the auroral bulge expands pole-\nwards and the SCW steps polewards. It was suggested by\nBaumjohann (2002) that it is the pile-up of closed flux in the\nnear-tail, and the expansion tailwards of this pile-up region,\nthat forces the tail X-line to migrate down-tail.\nWe can estimate the down-tail motion of the X-line by con-\nsidering the amount of flux closed following each dipolar-\nization (\u223c0.1 GWb, Sect. 3.3) and the Bz component of the\nmagnetic field crossing the neutral sheet within the pile-up\nregion. If the latter is estimated to be 10 nT, the approx-\nimate average of the C1 and TC1 Bz measurements dur-\ning the flux build-up period (Fig. 3), then each burst of re-\nconnection closes flux that occupies a cross-sectional area\nof 1016 m2 through the neutral sheet. If this is distributed\nacross the width of the magnetotail, approximately 40RE ,\nthen it extends a distance of 6RE down-tail; if it occupies\nonly a fraction of the width of the tail, then it extends cor-\nrespondingly further. If no convection of this newly-closed\nflux towards the dayside occurred, then this would be the\napproximate distance that the X-line would be pushed be-\ntween each dipolarization. Assuming that the down-tail mo-\ntion of the X-line was continuous, and did not occur in steps,\nthen averaging over the duration between dipolarizations, the\nX-line has a velocity of\u223c20 km s\u22121. With non-zero but slug-\ngish convection, this becomes an overestimate, but provides\na qualitative explanation for the motion of the X-line.\nFollowing the cessation of dayside reconnection after\n03:45 UT the pile-up region decays, the field returning to\na more tail-like configuration at TC1 and Cluster. This im-\nplies that the pile-up can now be convected away faster than\nclosed flux is produced by tail reconnection, though recon-\nnection does continue as indicated by the contraction of the\npolar cap and elevated auroral activity after D5. We suggest,\nthen, that the tail reconnection rates subsides significantly af-\nter 03:45 UT, as the dayside reconnection rate relaxes, only to\nincrease again at D5 with the formation of a new tail X-line.\nThis would explain the appearance of the D5 SCW magnetic\nbay near SKT, equatorward of that associated with D4: by\nthis time convection has relieved the pile-up region and re-\ndistributed flux within the polar cap and auroral zone such\nthat the open\/closed field line boundary in the ionosphere has\nrelaxed to lower latitude.\nIt is interesting to note that subsequent to D5, the first sig-\nnificant build-up of dipolar field lines near Cluster, as seen by\nthe increase in Bz at C1, occurs after 04:30 UT (Fig. 10b). A\nsimilar signature is seen at TC1 (Fig. 10e), though now the\nincrease in Bz is smaller than during the earlier pile-up as\nTC1 is further down-tail than previously. This occurs shortly\nafter a brief return to southward IMF: it is possible again that\nnew open flux transported into the tail is once again influenc-\ning the tail dynamics.\n3.6 Substorm triggers\nThis study interval contains what we consider to be 2 main\nsubstorm onsets (20:45 UT and 02:19 UT). We have stud-\nied in detail the second substorm, comprising an initial on-\nset and four subsequent re-intensifications, each marked by a\ndipolarization. It is interesting to note that the first substorm\nonset occurred during an interval of northward IMF (Fig. 2),\nwhereas the second substorm and its first 3 re-intensifications\noccurred during southward IMF; the last intensification of\nthe second substorm occurred during northward IMF. As dis-\ncussed in Sect. 2.1, it is possible to think of substorm onset\nas the magnetospheric response to increasing pressure in the\nneutral sheet, caused by the accumulation of open flux in the\nmagnetotail lobes during the growth phase and the associated\nflaring of the tail magnetopause. In this case, it is to be ex-\npected that expansion phase onset will generally occur during\nperiods of southward IMF. While this is true for D1\u2013D4, it is\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 751\u2013767, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/751\/2006\/\nS. E. Milan et al.: Flux closure during a substorm 765\nnot true for D5 or the first substorm. These, then, appear to\ncontradict the simple picture presented above.\nHowever, we note now that the onset of the first substorm\ncoincides with a step-like enhancement in the solar wind dy-\nnamic pressure (not shown) from 0.63 to 0.8 nPa, a 25% in-\ncrease. Thus, even without an increase in the tail flare, the\npressure exerted on the magnetopause and hence the neutral\nsheet will be increased. This may be sufficient to trigger on-\nset.\nIn the case of D5, no similar enhancement in solar wind\npressure is seen. However, even after the preceding tail re-\nconnection associated with D1 to D4, the polar cap has not\ncontracted (Fig. 10g), as open flux has been continuously\nadded at the dayside. So, even though the IMF is now di-\nrected northwards, similar conditions still exist in the tail that\npertained at the original substorm onset. For this reason, the\ntail may still be unstable and desire to reduce the open flux\ncontent of the lobes, thereby reducing the tail cross-section\nand easing pressure on the neutral sheet.\n3.7 Summary of reconnection rates\nWe summarize the preceding discussion of the reconnection\nrates and changes in open flux during the substorm in Fig. 13.\nPanel (a) shows schematically the variation in the open flux\nFPC (full line) through the course of the substorm. Panel (b)\nrepresents the reconnection rates. The dashed line shows the\ndayside reconnection rate, 8D , the rate of creation of open\nflux. This is initially high as the IMF is directed southwards,\nand only subsides after the northward-turning of the IMF af-\nter D4. Initially, then, FPC is growing: the substorm growth\nphase. After the onset of the substorm at D1 the NENL is\nreconnecting closed flux, and we represent this as 8NC , the\nnightside closed flux reconnection rate, represented by the\ndotted curve in Fig. 13b. Open flux is still created at the day-\nside at this time, so FPC continues to grow. However, our\nestimates of the open flux content of the magnetosphere have\nbeen based on the size of the dim region within the auro-\nral oval, which we have now argued contains \u223c0.1 GWb of\ndim closed flux (Sect. 3.4); in other words, we have over-\nestimated the quantity of open flux. We represent this in\nFig. 13a as the dotted line labelled FPC+FDC , where FDC\nis the size of the dim closed flux region. As this closed flux\nis reconnected by the NENL and brightens to form the initial\nauroral bulge, FDC decreases, and FPC+FDC , approaches\nFPC ; by D2 our estimates of the open flux content become\nincreasingly accurate.\nAfter D2, open flux is closed at the NENL, represented\nby the full line in Fig. 13b, 8NO being the nightside re-\nconnection rate of open flux. 8NO must be close to 8D\nas FPC is observed to become uniform with time. There\nwill be variations in 8NO in response to the step-wise mo-\ntion of the NENL at D3 and D4, but overall 8NO appears\nto track 8D , to the extent that that as 8D subsides at the\nnorthward-turning of the IMF 8NO decreases also, such that\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0001\u0005\u0003\n\u0001\u0005\n\u0001\u0006\u0003\n\u0001\u0006\u0007\n\u0001\u0002\n\u0003\u0004 \u0003\u0005\u0003\u0006\u0003\u0007\u0003\b\n\t\n\n\u000b\n\f\r\n\r\n\n\u000b\u000e\n\u000f\f\n\r\u0010\n\u0011\u0012\n\u000e\n\n\u0013\n\u0014\u0015\n\u0016\nFig. 13. A schematic representation of the open and dim-closed\nmagnetic flux inside the auroral oval, and day- and nightside recon-\nnection rates during the substorm (see text for details).\nFPC remains constant through-out this period. However, the\nmagnetotail is still stressed and reconnection finally com-\nmences once again, accompanied by the fifth dipolarization\nD5, to further close open flux. At this time 8NO dominates\nover 8D and FPC decreases.\n4 Conclusions\nWe summarize the main findings of this paper as follows:\n1) The substorm starting at 02:19 UT on 29 August 2004\nhas a two-stage onset, which we interpret as the re-\nconnection of closed field lines by a near-Earth neutral\nline (NENL) prior to the explosive onset of reconnec-\ntion of open flux. The first stage is associated with the\nshort-lived development of a small auroral bulge, and\nthe observation of a modest convection bay in ground\nmagnetometers. The second stage is associated with\nprolonged nightside auroral activity and the formation\nof a westward-travelling surge, a large convection bay,\nthe excitation of significant ionospheric convection, and\nplasmoid release. Throughout the substorm period,\ncompression regions in the lobe suggest the presence\nof many small-scale, earthward-travelling flux ropes in\nthe plasma sheet.\n2) There is a region of subvisual aurora on closed field\nlines polewards of the quiescent nightside auroral oval.\nThis may occupy up to 0.1 GWb of flux. This closed\nflux has to be reconnected prior to plasmoid release and\nthe reconnection of open lobe field lines. The size of\nthis region indicates the amount of flux contained in the\nplasmoid. As suggested by Milan et al. (2003), this sub-\nvisual closed flux region has to be accounted for when\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/751\/2006\/ Ann. Geophys., 24, 751\u2013767, 2006\n766 S. E. Milan et al.: Flux closure during a substorm\ndetermining the open flux content of the magnetosphere\nfrom auroral observations during geomagnetically qui-\nescent periods. Following substorm onset, however,\nthis region becomes aurorally active, and the ambigu-\nity in the relationship between the poleward boundary\nof the nightside auroral oval and the open\/closed field\nline boundary (OCB) is removed.\n3) Following the onset of open flux closure, repeated\ndipolarizations are observed in the tail, separated by\n20\u201330 min. We interpret these as step-wise movements\nof the NENL down-tail in response to flux pile-up in the\nnear-tail. Each step tailwards is associated with the for-\nmation of a new substorm current wedge at ever-higher\nlatitudes, and a step-wise poleward motion of convec-\ntion bays observed at the ground. Each dipolarization is\nalso accompanied by an enhancement in the cross-polar\ncap potential. Approximately 0.1 GWb of open flux is\nreconnected between each dipolarization.\n4) Flux pile-up is controlled by the competition between\nthe rates of reconnection at the NENL and convection of\nnewly-closed flux away from the nightside. The former\nappears to be closely controlled by the dayside recon-\nnection rate, which, if active re-supplies the lobes with\nnew open flux to maintain pressure on the neutral sheet.\nThe latter will be controlled by frictional coupling be-\ntween ionosphere and neutral atmosphere in the auro-\nral bulge region. After onset the IMF remains directed\nsouthwards and the pile-up region grows. Correspond-\ningly the NENL must move down-tail, away from the\npile-up region. Simple calculations indicate that X-line\nmotion should occur at a speed approaching 20 km s\u22121\ndown-tail. It is only after a northward-turning of the\nIMF that the pile-up region begins to subside, as con-\nvection now dominates. Hence, the dynamics of the tail\nduring the substorm seem to be strongly-driven by the\non-going level of solar wind-magnetosphere coupling at\nthe dayside.\n5) After the pile-up region subsides, due to the northward-\nturning of the IMF, there is a further dipolarization. We\nsuggest that this is because the tail is still in a highly-\nstressed state, despite the preceding 2 h of substorm ac-\ntivity. That is, we estimate that by this time \u223c0.3 GWb\nof open flux have been closed by the NENL, but an\nequivalent amount of flux have been opened at the day-\nside during the same period. Further tail activity is re-\nquired to close sufficient lobe flux to allow the magne-\ntotail to relax to a less flared configuration and relieve\npressure on the plasma sheet.\nAcknowledgements.
