INTRODUCTION\nMANY practical higher order digital filters can be real-ized by first-order digital filters and second-order dig-\nital filters in cascade and\/or parallel realizations. When such a\ndigital filter is implemented using a fixed-point microprocessor\nwith a two\u2019s complement arithmetic for the addition operation,\nthe physically realized filter is a nonlinear discrete-time system.\nDue to the nonlinearity, the dynamics of such a system may be\nquite complex, and chaotic behaviors may occur [1].\nMany researchers had studied the chaotic behaviors of an au-\ntonomous system [1]\u2013[10]. Some trajectory equations and sets\nof initial conditions corresponding to some types of trajecto-\nries are characterized in [1]. The admissibility of symbolic se-\nquences is studied in [1], [4], [6] and [7]. The analysis is ex-\ntended by considering all the real values of the filter parameter\nin [8], and all the real values of the filter parameters and\nin [9]. The periodic behaviors of the symbolic sequences are\ndiscussed in [1] and [10]. A saturation-type adder overflow is\nanalyzed in [2].

As a result, we need to analyze forced-input sys-\ntems in addition to autonomous systems. In this paper, we con-\ncentrate on the analysis of systems with step inputs.\nIn Section II, we will briefly describe the system using\nthe notations employed in the existing literature [1]\u2013[10]. In\nSection III, analytical and simulation results on the system with\nstep inputs are presented. Finally, a conclusion is presented in\nSection IV.\nII. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION\nThe system in [1]\u2013[10] is defined as follows.\nAssume a second-order digital filter can be represented by a\nstate\u2013space model\n(1)\nIf it can be realized by a direct form representation, then, the\nsystem can be further represented as\n(2)\nwhere and are the filter parameters, is the input signal,\nand are the state variables, and is the nonlinearity\ndue to the use of two\u2019s complement arithmetic.\nThe nonlinearity can be modeled as\n(3)\nsuch that\n(4)\nand . Hence, the system can be represented as\n(5)\n(6)\nfor , where\n(7)\n(8)\n1057-7122\/03$17.00 \u00a9 2003 IEEE\nLING et al.: STEP RESPONSE OF SECOND-ORDER DIGITAL FILTER 511\n(9)\nand\n(10)\nin which is the minimum integer satisfying\n(11)\nSince is an element in the discrete set\n, the values of can be viewed as sym-\nbols and is called a symbolic sequence.\nIn this paper, we only consider the case when the filter is\nmarginally stable, that is\n(12)\n(13)\n(14)\nfor , and .\nIt is worth noting that once the initial condition , the filter\nparameters, and the input signal are given, the state variables and\nthe symbolic sequences are uniquely defined by (5)\u2013(14).\nFor the system defined above, it is reported in [1], that, for\nthe autonomous response, there are three types of trajectories\non the phase portrait, namely type I, II, and III trajectories, re-\nspectively, depending on the initial conditions. The type I\u2013III\ntrajectories are defined as trajectories that give a single rotated\nellipse, some rotated, and translated ellipses, and an elliptical\nfractal pattern on the phase portrait, respectively [1]. In this\npaper, we investigate solutions to the following problems. Do\nwe have similar trajectory behaviors with step inputs for the\nsystem in the presence of overflow nonlinearity? What are the\neffects of the parameter and input step size on the trajectory\nbehaviors? What are the relationships among the trajectory be-\nhaviors, symbolic sequences and the initial conditions, when\noverflow occurs?\nIII. ANALYTICAL AND SIMULATION RESULTS\nIt is obvious that, in general, the method of affine trans-\nformation cannot relate the step-response behaviors and\nautonomous-response behaviors in a straightforward and\nsimplistic manner if the system is nonlinear. However, we\nwill show, in this section, that the step-response behaviors\ncan be related to the autonomous-response behaviors in an\nexplicit manner even overflow nonlinearity occurs. Based on\nthe method of affine transformation, some differences between\nthe step response and the autonomous response are explored.\nThe effects of the filter parameter and input step size , on the\ntrajectory behaviors, are discussed. Some previous necessary\nconditions for the trajectory behaviors, initial conditions and\nsymbolic sequences are extended and strengthened to become\nnecessary and sufficient conditions. Based on these necessary\nand sufficient conditions, some counter-intuitive results are\nreported.\nA. Type I Trajectory\nFor the type I trajectory, there is a single ellipse shown on\nthe phase portrait. The set of initial conditions for the type I tra-\njectory is an elliptic region on the phase portrait. In this section,\nsome results related to the symbolic sequences and initial condi-\ntions are explored. The set of the filter parameter and the input\nstep size that gives the type I trajectory is also determined. The\ndetails are explained by the following lemma.\nLemma 1: Let\n(15)\n(16)\n(17)\n(18)\nand\n(19)\nwhere\n(20)\nThen, the following three statements are equivalents:\ni) for\nii) for\niii)\nProof: The proof can be easily obtained by the use\nof an affine transformation. The key steps are shown in the\nAppendix.\n1) Trajectory Pattern: Since is a rotation matrix,\nfor corresponds to a circular trajectory\nwith center at the origin and radius\nBy the transformation in Lemma 1, that is\nthe trajectory of is an elliptical orbit with the center of the\nellipse at . Since\nthe center is on the diagonal line .\nCompared to that of the autonomous response, the center of\nthe ellipse is shifted by the vector , which\ndepends on the input step size and the filter parameter .\nFig. 1 shows the phase portrait of such a system when\nand with different initial conditions.

Fig. 1(e) shows the trajectory when .\nFig. 1(f) shows the corresponding symbolic sequence,\nfor . Fig. 1(g) shows the trajectory when .\nFig. 1(h) shows the corresponding symbolic sequence,\nfor .\nThe significance of Lemma 1 is that some previous necessary\nconditions for the trajectory behaviors, initial conditions, and\nsymbolic sequences, are extended and strengthened to become\nnecessary and sufficient conditions. We will have a detailed dis-\ncussion on the relationship to the set of initial conditions in\nSection III-A-3, but we would like to mention in this section,\nthat a system will give a type I trajectory if and only if the sym-\nbolic sequence is constant at any time instant . Based\non this necessary and sufficient condition, some counter-intu-\nitive results are found. Lemma 1 implies that the system may\nalso give the type I trajectory even when overflow occurs, that\nis, for some . As examples, when\nfor , for , or\nfor , overflow does occur, but the system still gives the\ntype I trajectory, as illustrated in Fig. 1. This is a counter-intu-\nitive phenomenon that has not been reported before.\n2) Periodicity of the State Vector: In [1] and [10], it is re-\nported that even if a single ellipse is exhibited on the phase por-\ntrait, the state variables may not be periodic. Although this is\nnot a new result, we discuss them at this point, briefly, for com-\npleteness, by using the results in Lemma 1 and applying the ap-\nproach in [11] to obtain some partial results in [1], [10] in an\neasy way. Since is a rotation matrix, is periodic if and\nFig. 3. Possible values of a and c for a fixed s .\nonly if is a rational multiple of [1], [10], [11]. It is worth\nstating here that the frequency sprectrum of and\nconsists of impulses located at the dc frequency and at the nat-\nural frequency of the digital filter, no matter is periodic\nor not (It is one of various differences between continuous-time\nsystems and discrete-time systems [12]). For the symbolic se-\nquences, since for , the frequency sprectrum of\nconsists of an impulse located at the dc frequency only.\n3) Set of Initial Conditions for the Type I Trajectory: The set\nof initial conditions corresponding to the type I trajectory con-\nsists of rotated and translated elliptical regions. For each value\nof , the region is characterized by a single rotated and trans-\nlated ellipse with center at . It is interesting\nto note that these centers are the same as that of the trajectory\ndescribed in Section III-A-1, and so these centers are also on the\ndiagonal line . Compared to the autonomous response,\n514 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS\u2014I: FUNDAMENTAL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS, VOL. 50, NO. 4, APRIL 2003\nFig. 4. Parameter space for the type I trajectory.\nthe set of admissible initial conditions is shifted by the vector\n, which also depends on the input step size and\nthe filter parameter .\nMoreover, by transforming these ellipses to circles, the\nradii of the circles are . For\nthe autonomous-response case, the radii of the circles are\n, depending on\nthe values of . The corresponding radii of the circles\nfor the step-response case are ,\n, . Comparing\nthe two sequences, we can conclude that the sizes of the\nellipses for the step-response case are smaller than those for\nthe autonomous-response case.\nFig. 2 shows the set of initial conditions that gives the type I\ntrajectory when and .\n4) Set of Filter Parameter and Input Step Size Values for the\nType I Trajectory: The size of the elliptical region of the set of\ninitial conditions depend on , which\nshould of course be greater than zero. This implies that\n. For a given , the possible values of and are in\na translated triangle as shown in Fig. 3.\nBy combining the results for the different values of , that\nis, combining those triangles together, we have the parameter\nspace for the type I trajectory being characterized as shown in\nFig. 4.\nNote that\nSo, if and are in the parameter space shown in Fig. 4, then,\nthe centers of the trajectories are in automatically.\nThe parameter space for the type I trajectory includes the line\n. So, for any arbitrary value of , there\nexist some initial conditions such that the autonomous system\nwill give the type I trajectory.\nA counter-intuitive phenomenon can be derived from\nLemma 1. The parameter space also includes the points with\nlarge values of . It means that the system will also give the type\nI trajectory, even if the input step size is so large that overflow\nalways occurs. On the other hand, there are some values of\nand which are not in the parameter space shown in Fig. 4.\nThis region includes the case for very small values of . This\nimplies that the corresponding system can never give the type I\ntrajectory even though the input step size tends to a value very\nclose to zero, no matter what the initial conditions are. Under\nthis condition, the system will give either the type II or type III\ntrajectory, depending on the values of the initial conditions.\nB. Type II Trajectory\nNow we extend the analysis to the type II trajectory. For\nthe type I trajectory, by the method of affine transformation,\nthe step-response behaviors can be readily related to the au-\ntonomous-response behaviors. However, it is not the case for\nthe type II trajectory. The method of affine transformation need\nto be modified, as discussed below.\n1) Trajectory Pattern: It is found that there are some ellipses\non the phase portrait for the step response, and the centers of\nthese ellipses on the phase portrait are just shifted versions of\nthat of the autonomous response. The shift depends only on filter\nparameter and input step size . However, the shifts of the dif-\nferent ellipses are different. The shifts also depend on the peri-\nodicity of the symbolic sequences. The detail analytical results\nare explained in the following lemma.\nLemma 2: For a second-order digital filter, . Otherwise,\nthe system is a first-order system with delays. So, is not an\ninteger multiple of .

Set of initial conditions that give the type II trajectory.\nIt is interesting to note that when\nfor . Compared to , is shifted by\n, and is shifted by\nfor . Since different values of correspond\nto different shift values, the centers of the ellipses are shifted in\ndifferent positions. Moreover, the shift also depends on the pe-\nriodicity of the symbolic sequences, which cannot be predicted\nby the simple affine transformation used in Lemma 1.\nFig. 5(a) shows the phase portrait of such a system with\nand at the initial condition .\nFig. 5(b) shows the corresponding symbolic sequence. In this\nparticular case, the period of the symbolic sequence is four and\nthe trajectory consists of four ellipses with centers at for\n.\nThe significance of the second part of Lemma 2 is to give\na necessary and sufficient condition relating the symbolic se-\nquence and the type II trajectory. A system gives a type II tra-\njectory if and only if the symbolic sequence is periodic with\nperiod .\nFurthermore, the second part of Lemma 2 is a generalization\nof the first part of Lemma 1. By substituting into the\nsecond part of Lemma 2, becomes a constant for ,\nand we have . This gives the same\nresults given by the first part of Lemma 1.\n2) Periodicity of State Vector: For the type I trajectory,\nis periodic if and only if is a rational multiple of . For the\ntype II trajectory, this is also a necessary and sufficient condition\nfor the state variables to be periodic. However, the frequency\nsprectrum of and consists of impulses located at\nthe harmonic frequencies of the symbolic sequences, that is,\nfor , and at the natural frequency\nof the digital filter, no matter is periodic or not [12]. For\nthe symbolic sequences, since it is periodic with period , the\nfrequency sprectrum of consists of impulses located at its\nharmonic frequencies only.\n3) Set of Initial Condition for the Type II Trajectory: The set\nof initial conditions that gives type II trajectory is given by the\nfollowing lemma.\nLemma 3: such that for and\nif and only if\nfor .\nProof: For the necessity part, if such that\n, for and , then, by\nLemma 2, we have , for , and\n, where\nfor , and .

Hence, this proves the sufficiency part,\ncompleting the proof.\nLemma 3 implies that the set of initial conditions cor-\nresponding to the type II trajectory consists of rotated and\ntranslated elliptical regions. For each periodic symbolic se-\nquence for , we have a\ncorresponding single rotated and translated ellipse with center\nat for . Overally, the centers are the\nsame as that of the trajectory described in Lemma 2. Hence,\ncomparing to that of the autonomous response, the centers are\nshifted to different positions, and the shifts depend on filter\nparameter , input step size, and the periodicity of the symbolic\nsequences. By transforming these ellipses to circles, the radii\nof these circles are for .\nFig. 6 shows the set of initial conditions that give the type II\ntrajectory when and . It can be seen from the\nfigure that the set of initial conditions is in the elliptical regions\nwith centers at for .\nWe can consider Lemma 3 as a generalization of the second\npart of Lemma 1. By substituting into Lemma 1, we\nhave the results given by second part of Lemma 1.\nC. Type III Trajectory\nNow, we proceed to the type III trajectory.\nRemark 1: Based on our intensive simulations, we ob-\nserve that the system may give an elliptical fractal pattern\nof trajectory if the system does not give the type I or type II\ntrajectories.\nFig. 7(a) shows the phase portrait of such a system with\nand at the initial condition .\nFig. 7(b) shows the corresponding symbolic sequence.

Hence, the frequency\nspectrum of the state variables and the symbolic sequences are\ncontinuous.\nRemark 3: Let :\nand for and\n. Define . Then, the set of\ninitial conditions that may give the type III trajectory is . That\nis, the system with initial condition in the rest of the space after\ntaking away the regions indicated in Figs. 2 and 6 may give rise\nto an elliptical fractal pattern of trajectory.\nFig. 8 shows the set of initial conditions that will give the\ntype III trajectory when and .\n520 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS\u2014I: FUNDAMENTAL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS, VOL. 50, NO. 4, APRIL 2003\nFig. 8. Set of initial conditions that gives the type III trajectory.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nThe main focus of this paper is the analysis of second-order\ndigital filters with two\u2019s complement arithmetic, when there are\nstep inputs. Even though in the presence of the overflow nonlin-\nearity, the step-response behaviors can be related to some cor-\nresponding autonomous-response behaviors by means of affine\ntransformations. Based on this method, some differences be-\ntween the step response and autonomous response are explored.\nFor the type I trajectory, there is a single ellipse on the phase\nportrait where the center of the ellipse is located on the diag-\nonal line. Compared to that of the autonomous response, the el-\nlipse is shifted. The shift depends on the filter parameter and the\ninput step size. For the type II trajectory, we have similar results.\nThere are some ellipses on the phase portrait and these ellipses\nare the shifted versions of the autonomous-response case. How-\never, different ellipses are shifted in different positions, and the\nshifts also depend on the periodicity of the symbolic sequences.\nFor the rest of the space of initial conditions, the system with\nstep input may exhibit the type III trajectory with an elliptical\nfractal pattern shown on the phase portrait.\nBesides, we have found the sets of initial conditions for dif-\nferent types of trajectory. The sets of initial conditions for the\ntype I and type II trajectories are elliptical regions on the phase\nportrait, while the centers of these ellipses are the centers of their\nelliptical trajectories. The sizes of those ellipses for the type I\ntrajectory are smaller compared to that of the autonomous case.\nFor the type III trajectory, the set of initial conditions is the unit\nsquare minus the sets of initial conditions that give the type I or\nthe type II trajectory.\nSome previous necessary conditions for the trajectory behav-\niors, initial conditions, and symbolic sequences are extended\nand strengthened to become necessary and sufficient conditions.\nIt is proved in this paper, that the system gives the type I trajec-\ntory if and only if the symbolic sequences are constant at any\ntime instant. This implies that the system will give the type I tra-\njectory even when overflow occurs. The system gives the type\nII trajectory if and only if the symbolic sequences are periodic\nwith period greater than one. In general, the results obtained in\nthe type I trajectory can be obtained by setting the period equal\nto one into the results obtained in the type II trajectory. For the\ntype III trajectory, the symbolic sequences are aperiodic.\nThe filter parameter values and the input step sizes that might\ngive the type I trajectory are found, and some counter-intuitive\nresults are reported. It is interesting to note that for some filter\nparameters, the system may give the type I trajectory even when\na large input step size is applied. On the other hand, the system\nwill not give the type I trajectory for some values of filter pa-\nrameter and any arbitrarily small input step size no matter what\nthe initial conditions are. Under this situation, the system will\ngive either the type II or the type III trajectory, depending on the\ninitial conditions.\nAPPENDIX\nThis Appendix is to prove Lemma 1.
