We therefore hypothesised that patients with improved survival would have high \ntumour islet expression of chemokine receptors known to be associated with favourable prognosis in cancer. This \nstudy investigated chemokine receptor expression in the tumour islets and stroma in NSCLC.\nMethods: We used immunohistochemistry to identify cells expressing CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, CXCR5 and CCR1 \nin the tumour islets and stroma in 20 patients with surgically resected NSCLC. Correlations were made with \nmacrophage and mast cell expression.\nResults: There was increased expression of CXCR2, CXCR3, and CCR1 in the tumour islets of ES compared with poor \nsurvival (PS) patients (p = 0.007, 0.01, and 0.002, respectively). There was an association between 5 year survival and \ntumour islet CXCR2, CXCR3 and CCR1 density (p = 0.02, 0.003 and <0.001, respectively) as well as stromal CXCR3 density \n(p = 0.003). There was a positive correlation between macrophage density and CXCR3 expression (rs = 0.520, p = 0.02) \nand between mast cell density and CXCR3 expression (rs = 0.499, p = 0.03) in the tumour islets.\nConclusion: Above median expression of CXCR2, CXCR3 and CCR1 in the tumour islets is associated with increased \nsurvival in NSCLC, and expression of CXCR3 correlates with increased macrophage and mast cell infiltration in the \ntumour islets.\nBackground\nWe have demonstrated previously that the tissue micro-\nlocalisation of immune cells in surgically resected\nNSCLC is a key determinant of patient survival [1,2]. In\nparticular, when macrophages are located within tumour\nepithelial islets, a striking improvement in patient sur-\nvival is evident. This supports the view that these islet-\nassociated macrophages contribute to cytotoxic mecha-\nnisms which limit tumour dissemination. It is not known\nwhy some patients have high levels of potentially cyto-\ntoxic cells in their tumour islets and others do not, but\nthe expression of macrophage-recruiting chemokines\nwithin the tumour islets by either tumour cells them-\nselves or infiltrating immune cells is likely to be a key\nmechanism. Therefore an improved understanding of\nchemoattractant pathways that are active may lead to the\ndevelopment of novel chemotherapeutic agents.\nChemokines are cytokines that have chemotactic prop-\nerties influencing cell migration [3]. Chemokines them-\nselves are released in response to cell activation by\ndiverse cytokines and pathologic stimuli [3]. The\nchemokine superfamily consists of over 40 ligands and\napproximately 20 receptors [3]. They can be classified\ninto four groups: -CXC-, -CC-, -C- and -CX3C - accord-\ning to amino acid position at the N terminal. Several\nchemokines have been shown to be present in cancer tis-\nsue including CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL8, CCL17,\nCCL18, CCL20, CCL21, CCL22, CCL27, CCL28, CXCL1,\nCXCL2, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL12, and\nCXCL13 [4-6]. An important ligand\/receptor pair is\nCXCL12 and CXCR4 which may be involved in the regu-\nlation of metastasis in NSCLC [7]. CCL5 activates CCR1,\n-3 and -5, and CCL5 expression by tumour cells in\npatients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma has been asso-\nciated with improved survival [8]. CXCL8 (interleukin-8)\nhas two chemokine receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2 [9].\nCXCL8 is a mediator of angiogenesis in lung cancer [10]\n* Correspondence: cohri@doctors.org.uk\n1 Department of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, University of Leicester, \nLeicester, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the articleBioMed Central\n\u00a9 2010 Ohri et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Zhu found that cell\nproliferation was significantly reduced by anti-CXCR1\nantibody but not by anti-CXCR2 antibody and concluded\nthat the mitogenic function of CXCL8 in lung cancer is\nmediated mainly by CXCR1 receptor [9]. However, it has\nalso been demonstrated in a murine model that depletion\nof CXCR2 inhibits tumour growth and angiogenesis in\nlung cancer [13]. With respect to immune cell infiltration\nin cancer, CXCR3, along with IFN-\u03b3, may play an impor-\ntant role with respect to NK cell infiltration [14].\nThe precise localisation of chemokine receptor expres-\nsion in NSCLC with respect to tumour islets or stroma\nhas not been examined. Given that we have demonstrated\npreviously that the tissue microlocalisation of mac-\nrophages and mast cells in NSCLC is intimately related\nwith outcome, [1,2], we hypothesised that this principle\nwould also apply to the expression of chemokine recep-\ntors. If true, we would expect that patients with improved\nsurvival would have high tumour islet expression of\nchemokine receptors known to be associated with\nfavourable prognosis in cancer such as CXCR3 and\nCCR1.\nMethods\nStudy Population\nThe study was approved by the Leicestershire Research\nEthics Committee. The tissue specimens evaluated were\nfrom 20 patients with NSCLC who had undergone resec-\ntion with curative intent at the University Hospitals of\nLeicester National Health Service Trust (Leicester, United\nKingdom). These patients had resections during two\nperiods - one dating from 1991 to 1994 and the second\nfrom January to December 1999. This cohort of patients\nhas been described previously [1]. Of the 20 patients\nstudied, 14 were men and average age at surgery was 72.3\nyears (standard deviation, 6.53; range, 60.2 to 82.4 years).\nFull clinicopathologic information was gathered before\nand after surgery, including patient characteristics, treat-\nment, combined clinical and surgical staging results (pre-\noperative staging by computed tomography scan,\nselective mediastinoscopy, and systematic lymph node\nsampling at operation), histologic subtype, tumour grade,\nand survival data. Patients were divided into two groups,\nextended survival (ES) (mean \u00b1 SEM 90.8 \u00b1 11.8 months)\nand poor survival (PS) (mean \u00b1 SEM 7.9 \u00b1 0.8 months).\nPatient characteristics are shown in Table 1.\nImmunohistology\nSpecimens studied were formalin fixed and paraffin\nembedded. Only blocks containing the advancing edge of\nthe primary tumour were evaluated. Tissue sections of 4\n\u03bcm thickness were cut onto glass slides and then de-\nwaxed in xylene and rehydrated through graded alcohols.\nAntigen retrieval was carried out using Trilogy Antigen\nRetrieval solution (Cell Marque, Hot Springs, United\nStates of America) in a pressure cooker (heated to\n117.5\u00b0C for 1 min and then cooled to 100\u00b0C for 30 sec-\nonds). Mouse antihuman antibodies were used (all R & D\nSystems Europe, Abingdon, United Kingdom) as follows:\nCXCR1 (clone 42705), CXCR2 (clone 48311), CXCR3\n(clone 49801), CXCR4 (clone 44716), CXCR5 (clone\n51505) and CCR1 (clone 53504). Immunostaining was\nperformed and the chemokine receptors were developed\nwith peroxidase and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydro-\nchloride (brown reaction product). Sections were then\ncounterstained with haematoxylin and mounted in an\naqueous mounting medium (BDH Chemicals Ltd, Poole,\nUnited Kingdom). Appropriate isotype controls were per-\nformed where the primary antibodies were replaced by\nirrelevant mouse mAb of the same isotype and at the\nsame concentration as the specific primary mAb.\nAnalysis and Validation of Immunostaining\nAnalysis was performed blind with respect to the clinical\noutcome. The ten most representative high-power fields\n(x400) per slide were manually selected using an Olym-\npus BX50 microscope (Olympus, Southall, United King-\ndom). The respective areas of stroma and of tumour-cell\nislets were then measured at \u00d7400 magnification using\nAnalysis imaging software (Soft Imaging System GmbH).\nThe number of nucleated macrophages and cells with\npositive staining for the phenotype marker in each area\nwere then counted manually and expressed as cells\/mm2\nof stroma or tumour islets. Analysis was repeated for 5\npatients to assess repeatability and validity.\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analyses were carried out using the GraphPad\nPrism software package (v. 4.02; GraphPad Prism Soft-\nware Inc, San Diego, CA). For categoric analysis, the\nmedian value was used as a cut point to dichotomise the\nseries. The \u03c72 test was used to test for relationships\nbetween categoric variables, and the Mann-Whitney\nnonparametric test was used to compare categoric with\ncontinuous variables. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were\nused to look for correlations with survival and were com-\npared with the use of the log-rank statistic. For the above\ncomparisons, p < 0.05 was considered statistically signifi-\ncant.\nResults\nPatient Characteristics\nPatent characteristics are shown in Table 1.

Appropriate isotype\ncontrols were negative. In order to assess the validity of\nthe method, area measurements and cell counts were\nrepeated and intraclass correlation coefficients calcu-\nlated. Good correlations were found for both: 0.997 (95%\nCI, 0.996 to 0.998, p < 0.001) and 0.995 (95% CI, 0.993 to\n0.997, p < 0.001). This method of analysis has also been\nvalidated by our group previously [1,2].\nCellular Distribution\nThe majority of chemokine receptor immunostaining in\nthe tumour islets was present in inflammatory cells and\nrarely seen on tumour epithelial cells. Similarly in the\nstroma, immunostaining was also seen in inflammatory\ncells with no expression evident on vessels.

There were no significant differences for\nCXCR1, CXCR4, or CXCR5 in either the tumour islets or\nstroma (Figs 2A and 2B).

The\nlogrank statistic was used to compare survival rates.\nThere was a positive association between survival and\ntumour islet CXCR2 (p = 0.02), CXCR3 (p = 0.003) and\nCCR1 (p < 0.001) density, but no significant associations\nbetween survival and tumor islet CXCR1, CXCR4 and\nCXCR5 density (Fig 3A-F). After dichotomisation at the\nmedian cell density for cells expressing each marker, 5-\nyear survival was 50.3% above the median compared with\n19.8% below the median for CXCR2, 60.2% versus 9.9%\nfor CXCR3 and 59.8% versus 9.9% for CCR1. There was a\npositive association between survival and stromal\nCXCR3 (p = 0.003) density, but no significant associa-\ntions between survival and stromal CXCR1, CXCR2,\nCXCR4, CXCR5 and CCR1 density (Fig 4A-F).\nCorrelation with macrophage and mast cell counts\nChemokine receptor expressing cell counts were corre-\nlated against islet and stromal macrophage counts which\nhad been generated previously [1].

The results demonstrate\nthat patients with extended survival have significantly\nincreased expression of CXCR2, CXCR3 and CCR1 in\ntheir tumour islets compared to patients with poor sur-\nvival, and significantly increased expression of CXCR2,\nCXCR3 and CXCR4 in their tumour stroma. In addition,\nwe observed that patients with above median expression\nof CXCR2, CXCR3 and CCR1 in their tumour islets and\npatients with above median expression of CXCR3 in their\nstroma had significantly improved 5-year survival. Inter-\nestingly, when chemokine receptor expression was com-\npared with macrophage density in the tumour islets (Fig\n5), it was noted that there was a positive correlation with\nincreasing islet macrophage count and expression of\nCXCR3 and CCR1 and also, between islet mast cell num-\nbers and CXCR3.\nWe have demonstrated previously the importance of\ncellular microlocalisation in terms of potential sites for\nimmune cytotoxicity against NSCLC tumours [1,2]. In\nparticular, NSCLC tumour islets are the likely site of host\ncytotoxic responses against tumour development and\nprogression. Not only does increasing macrophage infil-\ntration of NSCLC tumour islets correlate strongly with\nsurvival, but these macrophages are predominantly of the\nM1 cytotoxic phenotype [2]. Our current results suggest\nFigure 2 Chemokine receptor densities in the tumour islets for extended survival (ES) patients (A) and poor survival (PS) patients (B) and \nin the stroma for ES patients (C) and PS patients (D).\nCXCR1 CXCR2 CXCR3 CXCR4 CXCR5 CCR1\n0\n20\n40\n60\n* * *A\nES ISLETS\nD\nE\nN\nS\nIT\nY\n I\nN\n I\nS\nL\nE\nT\nS\n(C\nE\nL\nL\nS\n\/M\nM\n2 )\nCXCR1 CXCR2 CXCR3 CXCR4 CXCR5 CCR1\n0\n20\n40\n60\nB\nPS ISLETS\nD\nE\nN\nS\nIT\nY\n I\nN\n I\nS\nL\nE\nT\nS\n(C\nE\nL\nL\nS\n\/M\nM\n2 )\nCXCR1 CXCR2 CXCR3 CXCR4 CXCR5 CCR1\n0\n20\n40\n60D\nPS STROMA\nD\nE\nN\nS\nIT\nY\n I\nN\n S\nT\nR\nO\nM\nA\n(C\nE\nL\nL\nS\n\/M\nM\n2 )\nCXCR1 CXCR2 CXCR3 CXCR4 CXCR5 CCR1\n0\n20\n40\n60\n140\n200 ***C\nES STROMA\nD\nE\nN\nS\nIT\nY\n I\nN\n S\nT\nR\nO\nM\nA\n(C\nE\nL\nL\nS\n\/M\nM\n2 )\nOhri et al.

Of particular relevance to this, a CCR1 ligand\nCCL5, is over-expressed in NSCLC tumours character-\nized by T lymphocyte infiltration [8]. Of further rele-\nvance, one of the ligands for CCR1 is CCL3 which is\nthought to stimulate the production and release of TNF\u03b1,\na cytokine that is expressed and which has cytotoxic\npotential in the tumour islets [2].\nCXCR3 has not been described on macrophages, but is\nexpressed on cytotoxic NK cells [14], human lung mast\ncells [15] and T lymphocytes [16]. These cell types are\nassociated with improved survival in NSCLC [1,17,18],\nand are likely to interact with macrophages in mediating\ntumour killing. CXCR3 expression was markedly\nincreased in both the tumour islets and stroma in NSCLC\npatients with extended survival compared to those with\npoor survival. Tumours enriched for cells expressing\nCXCR3 are likely to be producing excess quantities of one\nor all of the CXCR3 ligands, CXCL9, -10 and -11.\nCXCL10 has been shown to be expressed by tumour epi-\nthelial cells in squamous NSCLC [19]. CXCR3 agonists\nprotect against tumour dissemination in mouse models\n[19-21], observations supported by the improved out-\ncome associated with increased CXCR3 expression in\nthis study. In mouse models, CXCR3 ligands are thought\nto work predominantly through inhibition of angiogene-\nsis, but our findings of CXCR3 expression on numerous\ninflammatory cells, suggests an important role in the host\nanti-tumour immune response. The CXCR3 ligands can\nbe produced by a number of inflammatory and structural\ncells, and are typically thought of as markers of a Th1\nimmunological response as they are induced predomi-\nnantly by IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 [22]. Overall, the increased\nexpression of CXCR3 on inflammatory cells within the\nNSCLC tumour stroma and islets in patients with\nextended survival, supports the view that cytotoxic cell-\nmediated immunity contributes to protection of the host\nagainst NSCLC progression, and suggests that augment-\ning this arm of the immunological response may be bene-\nficial clinically.\nExamining the expression and cellular provenance of\nthe ligands for CXCR3 and CCR1 will be important in\nfuture studies of NSCLC. CCR1 ligands can also be pro-\nduced by a variety of immune and structural cells, and\nCCL5 is produced by NSCLC tumour epithelial cells [8].\nIt is attractive to speculate therefore that the key factor\ndetermining the nature, intensity and microlocalisation\nof the immune response in NSCLC is the pattern and\nintensity of chemokine production by the tumour itself.\nOur finding of distinct chemokine receptor patterns in\nthe tumour and stroma which associate with survival\nsupports this view.\nThe chemokine receptor CXCR4 is implicated in the\nregulation of cancer growth, metastasis, relapse and\nresponse to treatment. In patients with NSCLC, CXCR4\nexpression has been found on circulating cytokeratin+\ncells, with increased expression correlating with\nimproved survival [23]. Our results suggest that increased\nexpression of CXCR4 in the NSCLC stroma relates to\nimproved survival. From our previous investigations\n[1,2], however, the tumour islets appears to be the critical\nmicro-compartment for host immune responses against\nNSCLC. Further work will therefore be required to\nunderstand the biological role of stromal CXCR4 expres-\nsion.\nThe chemokine receptor CXCR2 exerts multiple func-\ntions depending on the cell type it is expressed on. In\nNSCLC it is generally considered to promote tumorigen-\nesis and metastasis through the induction of angiogenesis\n[9,13]. However, it is also implicated in the senescence of\npre-neoplastic cells and may inhibit neoplastic transfor-\nmation [24]. In our NSCLC tissue samples, CXCR2 in the\ntumour islets was not seen on tumour epithelial cells but\nwas present on inflammatory cells. Interestingly, its\nexpression was increased in the tumour islets of patients\nwith extended survival compared to those with poor sur-\nvival. This is compatible with the suggestion that loss of\nCXCR2 on tumour epithelial cells promotes neoplastic\ntransformation in NSCLC [24], but also suggests that\nCXCR2 may serve to limit tumour growth through its\nexpression on inflammatory cells recruited to the tumour.\nThus CXCR2 may have dual roles in NSCLC, promoting\ntumour progression through the induction of angiogene-\nsis in the stroma, but limiting tumour growth through the\nrecruitment of inflammatory cells to the tumour islets.\nTargeting CXCR2 in NSCLC may therefore prove to have\nunpredictable effects depending on the relative balance\nbetween these two opposing activities.\nIn summary, above median expression of the\nchemokine receptors CXCR2, CXCR3 and CCR1 in the\ntumour islets is associated with increased 5-year survival.\nIncreased expression of CXCR3 and CCR1 correlates\nwith increased macrophage expression in the tumour\nislets and therefore these receptors may be involved in\nthe pathway that attracts cytotoxic M1 macrophages,\nmast cell, B cells, T cells and NK cells into the tumour\nislets. Therefore, if a therapeutic agent could increase the\nproduction of the ligands for CXCR3 and CCR1 by the\ntumour epithelial cell, this might lead to an improved\nimmune response to NSCLC and thus better survival.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nCO carried out the immunohistochemical staining, slide analysis, statistical\nanalysis and prepared the manuscript.
