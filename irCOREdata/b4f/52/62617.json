As such, the two domains are redefined as the Choum-Rag el \nAbiod Terrane and Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane.  Previous isotopic studies of metamorphic litholo-\ngies of the eastern Choum-Rag el Abiod Terrane indicate a succession of crustal growth from \nabout 3.5-3.45 Ga to between about 3.2 and 2.99 Ga. Isotopic data presented in this contribu-\ntion from the Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane indicate that emplacement of major calc-alkaline plutons \noccurred at c.2.93 Ga after volcanism (preserved as greenstone belts) that included late felsic \neruptive centres dated at c.2965 Ma. This Mesoarchaean intrusive and extrusive magmatism \nwas confined to the Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane where it was emplaced through migmatitic or-\nthogneisses that are the oldest lithodemic unit of the Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane. Widespread bi-\nmodal, post-tectonic magmatism in both terranes included major granitic magmatism dated at \nc.2730 Ma.  \nThe N- to NNE-trending curvilinear T\u00e2\u00e7ar\u00e2t -Inemma\u00fbdene Shear Zone that separates the \ntwo terranes records late intense transpressive ductile shearing. It has a flower structure over a \nhorizontal distance of about 70 km across its southern portion with unquantifiable sinistral \nhorizontal offset, and east-directed thrusting on its eastern side where it cuts into the Choum-\nRag el Abiod Terrane. A new U-Pb zircon age of 2954\u00b111 Ma is presented for a deformed \ngranite confined within the central part of this shear zone. A minimum age for the shearing is \nprovided by a previously determined c. 2.73 Ga age for a post-tectonic granite that cuts across \nthe easternmost part of the shear zone in the Choum-Rag el Abiod Terrane.  \n \nThe Reguibat1 Shield (Menchikoff, 1949) forms the exposed NW part of the West African \nCraton that underlies much of NW Africa. This craton is a large segment of Precambrian crust \n(~4,500, 000 km2) stable since about 1700 Ma and bounded on all sides by Pan African oro-\n                                                                 \n1 Also spelt R\u2019gue\u00efbat  \nC folder Geol Soc NOVEMBER 06 file \n04\/08\/2008 2\ngenic belts (Cahen et al., 1984). However, much of the craton is concealed beneath a cover of \nvarious unmetamorphosed sedimentary strata and unconsolidated superficial deposits of the Sa-\nhara Desert. The Reguibat Shield refers to the northwestern part of the craton west of the \nTaoudeni Basin (Fig.1), whereas the southern exposed part is referred to as the Leo Shield. Dil-\nlon & Sougy (1974) and Bessoles (1977) identified two provinces within the Reguibat Shield: a \nSW Province composed of rocks older than c.2000 Ma (i.e. pre-\u2018Eburnian Cycle\u2019) that includes \nthe rocks described in the present paper and a central and northeastern province of Eburnian \nrocks (recently described by Schofield et al., 2006). \nSubsequently, Rocci et al. (1991) divided the Reguibat Shield into two main parts including \nan \u2018Archaean Shield\u2019 in northern Mauritania (part of the SW Province), itself divided into an \neastern Amsaga-Tiris-Ouassat domain and a western Tasiast-Lebzenia domain. Our mapping in \nNW Mauritania in the general area west of Atar (Key, 2003; Key & Loughlin, 2003; Key et al., \n2003; Pitfield et al., 2005), defined the geographical limits of these two domains and their con-\ntact relationship. The eastern and western domains are renamed the Choum-Rag el Abiod Ter-\nrane and Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane respectively after newly defined type areas (Pitfield et al., \n2005). The redefinition of the two crustal segments as terranes is because the isotopic evidence \nfrom the present and previous studies shows that they preserve different Mesoarchaean geologi-\ncal histories indicative of different geotectonic settings and because they are separated by a ma-\njor ductile shear zone, now named the T\u00e2\u00e7ar\u00e2t -Inemma\u00fbdene Shear Zone (TISZ). 2 \nChoum-Rag El Abiod Terrane   \nPotrel et al. (1998) considered that the Amsaga region of the Reguibat Shield (the Choum-\nRag El Abiod Terrane) formed through a series of crustal growth events between about 3.50-\n3.45 Ga until 2.73 Ga. An early event is recorded in migmatitic orthogneisses at about 3.5-\n3.45Ga (Auvray et al., 1992; Potrel, 1994; Potrel et al., 1996). Zircons from a single migmatitic \ngneiss were dated by the SHRIMP U-Pb method to give ages of between 3515\u00b115 Ma and \n3422\u00b110 Ma with Nd model ages of about 3.64 Ga (Potrel et al., 1996). The migmatites are in-\nterlayered with mafic gneisses of possible volcanic origin, as well as with undoubted metasedi-\nmentary rocks. These include marbles and hyperaluminous gneisses (including Kfeldspar-\nquartz-sillimanite-biotite-hercynite-garnet-gneisses and sillimanite-cordierite-garnet-gneisses). \nA granulite facies metamorphism was interpreted to have occurred between about 3.20 and 2.99 \nGa based on SHRIMP dating of zircons from charnockites dated at 2986\u00b18 Ma with a whole-\n                                                                 \n2 The shear zone is named after two locations where it is best exposed. There is a near-continuous section across \nthe shear zone in the T\u00e2\u00e7ar\u00e2t - (a NE-trending strip of land within the Akchar dune field to the northwest of Chami) \nand strongly deformed granites within the shear zone form large inselbergs at Inemma\u00fbdene.  \n \nC folder Geol Soc NOVEMBER 06 file \n04\/08\/2008 3\nrock Sm-Nd isochron at 3012\u00b1142 Ma (Potrel et al., 1998) and Nd model ages of about 3.23-\n3.10 Ga (Barr\u00e8re, 1967; Potrel et al., 1996). This metamorphism generated new gneissic fabrics \nwith partial melting and emplacement of minor anatectic granites including the Ioulguend Gran-\nite (Fig. 2; Potrel et al., 1998). Later granitic magmatism dated at 2726\u00b17 Ma coincided with the \nemplacement of gabbroic intrusions dated at 2706\u00b154 Ma and about 2740 Ma (Auvray et al., \n1992; Potrel et al., 1998). Negative \u03b5Nd values at 2.7 Ga for one of the \u2018late\u2019 granites (Potrel et \nal., 1996 & 1998) imply that it was, at least in part, derived from pre-existing crust. Fieldwork \nundertaken as part of the present study has confirmed the polyphase sequence of metamorphic \nand intrusive events documented by previous work. \nMetamorphic lithologies \nThe characteristic feature of the terrane is the preponderance of high-grade (granulite facies) \nmetamorphic rocks lacking primary (sedimentary and igneous) textures (Fig. 2). The various \ngneisses and charnockitic rocks described by previous workers are tectonically interlayered. \nMigmatitic gneisses underlie a flat regolith surface with a gravel or sand veneer and are the \ndominant lithology in the south. Here, other lithologies form parallel lenses, layers or sheets \nwithin the migmatitic gneisses (Key et al., 2003). Charnockitic rocks and thick, variably gar-\nnetiferous quartzofeldspathic gneiss units are the dominant northern lithologies. These litholo-\ngies are noticeably absent from the Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane. Thinner bands of other lithologies \nincluding quartzites, banded ironstones and calc-silicate rocks form strike-parallel low ridges \nthroughout the Choum-Rag el Abiod Terrane.  \nThe migmatitic gneisses have coarse-grained, biotite-bearing, grey tonalitic gneiss palaeosomes \ncut by several generations of felsic veins including invasive partial melt patches, that comprise \nup to 50% of the rock volume (phlebitic to stromatic migmatite textures, Fig. 3a). Petrographi-\ncally, neosome phases range in composition from monzo- to syeno-granite. Garnets commonly \nform in clusters, and cordierite is locally present as relatively large grains in the gneissic \ngroundmass. The whole rock chemical compositions of these migmatitic gneisses are similar to \nthe migmatitic gneisses from the Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane. The Choum-Rag el Abiod Terrane \nmigmatitic gneisses have SiO2 contents of 63.3 \u201372.0% and total alkali contents of 5.7 to 9.3%. \nTasiast-Tijirit Terrane migmatitic gneisses have more restricted SiO2 contents (72.2-74.7%) and \nalso have a more restricted range of total alkali contents (6.9-8.4%). In general, the Tasiast-\nTijirit Terrane migmatitic gneisses appear more fractionated than those of the Choum-Rag el \nAbiod Terrane (Pitfield et al., 2005).  \nMassive, variably garnetiferous quartzofeldspathic gneisses (previously referred to as \u2018lep-\ntynites\u2019 by Barr\u00e8re, 1967) and hypersthene-bearing charnockitic gneisses can occur in stacked \nsequences of tabular units each up to about 40m in thickness (see also Barr\u00e8re, 1967). Gneissos-\nC folder Geol Soc NOVEMBER 06 file \n04\/08\/2008 4\nity in the quartzofeldspathic gneisses is defined by mm to cm-thick mafic stringers and seams \nwith parallel quartz-garnet bands up to 30cm thick that may mimic a primary layering. These \nrocks may also carry sillimanite and hercynite spinel along with the biotite in mafic clots and \naggregates.  \nCoarse-grained sillimanite-garnet-cordierite-Kfeldspar-gneiss bands are up to several hun-\ndreds of metres in thickness and can be traced for several kilometres along strike. Other meta-\nsedimentary rocks are uncommon and include quartz-rich lithologies (garnetiferous quartzites \nand quartz-schists) as well as calc-silicate rocks and banded ironstones. The quartzites appear to \nform \u2018restite\u2019 seams and pods in migmatites. Amphibolites are common as small, elongate pods \nparallel to gneissosity in surrounding migmatitic gneisses. \nThere are minor meta-igneous intrusions within the migmatitic gneisses that are only found in \nthe Choum-Rag el Abiod Terrane. Numerous isolated small pods of dunite with criss-crossing \ncarbonate vein networks are present along the western margin of the Terrane as well as within \nthe sheared part of this Terrane along the eastern part of the TISZ. The pods comprise angular \npieces of altered dunite (antigorite after olivine with magnetite trails) embedded in a crosscut-\nting network of carbonate veins up to several centimetres in thickness. Individual mounds are up \nto about 200m long and 10m in height. The tectonic significance of these intrusions is not clear. \nBarr\u00e8re (1967) mapped a series of anorthositic sheets that are also not present in the Tasiast-\nTijirit Terrane. These sheets are concordant to the regional NE-SW to N-S structural grain of the \nhost gneisses. Individual sheets can be traced for several kilometres and are less than 100m in \nthickness.   \nThe southern exposed half of the Choum-Rage el Abiod Terrane is intensely sheared within the \nTISZ (Fig. 1).  Individual lithological units (composed of all the lithologies described above) in \nthe shears are deformed into lenses from several centimetres up to several hundred metres in \nlength, and from less than 1cm up to tens of metres in thickness. The lenses are tectonically jux-\ntaposed in a quartz-mylonite matrix (Fig. 3b). Transposed planar fabrics are dominant, locally \nwith a down-dip lineation. \nPost-TISZ c2730 Ma plutonic rocks  \nBarr\u00e8re (1967) mapped a large granite in the centre-east part of the Atar area that he referred to \nas the Touijenjert-Modre\u00efgue Granite. He recognized a central porphyritic phase (Touijenjert \nGranite) surrounded by a gneissic biotite phase (Touyerma Granite). A third xenolithic phase \nwas noted during the present fieldwork. The NNW-trending Touijenjert-Modre\u00efgue Granite cuts \nacross major NE-trending shears that branch off the TISZ (Figs. 1 & 2) as well as cutting \nobliquely across the gross layering and tectonic fabric of its metamorphic country rocks. How-\never, the granite is itself cut by a new set of shears with zones of intense deformation (notably in \nC folder Geol Soc NOVEMBER 06 file \n04\/08\/2008 5\nthe NW part of the intrusion). Potrel et al. (1998) obtained a SHRIMP U-Pb age of 2726\u00b17 Ma \nfor the Touijenjert Granite that confirms an earlier single zircon age of 2715\u00b111 Ma obtained by \nAuvray et al. (1992). \nThe southernmost part of the Touijenjert-Modre\u00efgue Granite comprises a xenolithic medium-\ngrained, equigranular granite. The characteristic feature of the granite is the presence of angular \nblocks of different types of country rocks, most notably migmatitic gneisses. The blocks are \nchaotically organized and vary in size from several centimetres in length to up to huge blocks \nthat are tens of cubic metres in volume. It is suggested that the granite was emplaced into a pre-\nexisting m\u00e9lange within the NE- trending shear zone.  \nBarr\u00e8re (1967) also identified and described a major gabbro that underlies a range of large hills \nat Iguilid.  This gabbro has an arcuate NNE-SSW shape with a strike length of about 10km \nwithin the NE-trending shear zone through the middle of the Choum-Rag el Abiod Terrane (Fig. \n1). The gabbro is weakly metamorphosed with foliated margins and is now referred to as the \nIguilid Metagabbro. Several generations of quartzofeldspathic pegmatites cut the Choum-Rag El \nAbiod Terrane including late muscovite-tourmaline-garnet-beryl - bearing veins common within \nthe Iguilid Metagabbro.  Auvray et al. (1992) dated a granulitic gabbro to the south of the Iguilid \nbody (at Guelb el Azib) at c. 2.74 Ga that led Potrel et al. (1998) to conclude that there was a \nsecond high-grade metamorphic event in this area. \nTectono-thermal events \nTectono-thermal events recognized in the Choum-Rag El Abiod Terrane are divided into (1) \nearly (pre- TISZ) high-grade events, (2) events synchronous with the development of the TISZ \nzone and its NE-trending offshoot, and (3) post- TISZ events.  \nAn early polyphase tectono-thermal history (equivalent of the Precambrian 1 event of Barr\u00e8re, \n1967) is recorded that produced structures subsequently flattened by shearing associated with \nthe development of the TISZ. Gneissic fabrics are axial planar to tight to isoclinal folds of early \nvein phases, best seen in the migmatitic orthogneisses. The gneissosity is itself tightly folded \nwith the development of an axial planar foliation and intrafolial, rootless folds. Ptygmatic folds \nand complex interference fold patterns characterize the migmatitic rocks. Larger scale folds best \ndefined by individual lithologies such as amphibolite mimic the small-scale structures.   \nThe early polyphase metamorphic evolution culminated in a granulite facies event that included \ncharnockites dated at 2986\u00b18 Ma and terminated prior to the emplacement of post-tectonic gran-\nites and gabbroic bodies at about 2.73 Ga (Potrel et al., 1998). Granulite facies mineral assem-\nblages define gneissic fabrics and include various garnet-sillimanite-cordierite-Kfeldspar (-\nhercynite spinel) assemblages in paragneisses (Fig. 3c & d). The presence of Kfeldspar and ab-\nsence of muscovite suggests that these rocks have experienced significant partial melting. Small \nC folder Geol Soc NOVEMBER 06 file \n04\/08\/2008 6\npockets of symplectite seen in thin section of these paragneisses also suggest some incipient \nmelting. The garnet-sillimanite-cordierite assemblage documented in these samples is typically \nstable at conditions of about 800\u00b0C at pressures of about 6 Kbars (e.g. White et al., 2001) as \nrecorded by Potrel et al. (1998) for this region. Lower PT estimates are based on microprobe \ndata of two samples (shown in Fig 3c&d) of garnet-sillimanite-cordierite gneiss with minor bio-\ntite, K-feldspar, plagioclase and green hercynite spinel, from the central part of the Choum-Rag \nEl Abiod Terrane. The microprobe data were run through GPT, an Excel spreadsheet for ther-\nmobarometric calculations in metapelitic rocks (Reche & Martinez, 1996). The key minerals are \nnot significantly zoned and are apparently well suited to quantitative P-T estimation. GPT al-\nlows the simultaneous solution of two two-variable expressions through iteration, removing the \nneed to assume a value for one parameter (i.e. pressure or temperature) in order to estimate the \nother. Iterative calculation using the calibration for garnet-biotite equilibrium of Hodges & \nSpear (1982) with the garnet-plagioclase-biotite-quartz geobarometer of Hoisch (1990) pro-\nduces temperature estimates of 674\u00baC and 612 \u00baC, and pressure estimates of about 4.6 and 2.5 \nKbars, respectively. However, iterative calculation using the calibration for garnet-cordierite \nequilibrium of Bhattacharya et al. (1988) with the garnet-plagioclase-biotite-quartz geobarome-\nter of Hoisch (1990) produces slightly higher PT conditions (698 & 705 \u00baC and 5.0 & 3.8 Kbars \nrespectively). Although a substantial margin of error must be attached to the results they are \nconsistent with mineral equilibration in a high-temperature, low-to intermediate pressure (up to \n15 km depth) metamorphic environment.  The estimated PT conditions, although lower than \nthose recorded by Potrel et al. (1998), lie close to the reaction line for biotite + sillimanite = \ngarnet + cordierite + water (+ Kfeldspar) in the KFMASH system (Spear & Cheney, 1989). \nSpear (1993) notes that all the mineral phases involved in this reaction are found to co-exist im-\nplying that the reaction is divariant. Fig. 3c & d show that sillimanite growth followed cordierite \nas individual sillimanite laths cut across cordierite grains (and twinning in cordierite) to define \n(with biotite) a strong planar fabric. Garnet grains are fragmented and are also locally over-\ngrown by sillimanite needles. Slight pinitisation of many cordierite grains indicates some retro-\ngression. \nThe NE-trending shears through the southern exposed half of the Terrane are part of the Pre-\ncambrian 2 event of Barr\u00e8re (1967). Shear fabrics trend roughly NE-SW and dip both to the NW \nand SE (Fig. 4).  The sheared rocks have strong planar fabrics in which all fabrics (including \nveins) are parallel to a new foliation. Existing folds are tightened and refolded and new struc-\ntures include transposed gneissosity and ductile, westerly dipping thrusts and sub-vertical faults. \nQuartz-mylonites commonly infill thrust and fault planes. Individual lithological units were de-\nformed into lenses during this event by anastomising shears (Fig. 3b). The development of these \nC folder Geol Soc NOVEMBER 06 file \n04\/08\/2008 7\nductile shears pre-dated the emplacement of the Touijenjert-Modre\u00efgue Granite as this granite \ntruncates major NE-trending shears.  \nA third period of ductile shearing either occurred during emplacement of the Touijenjert-\nModre\u00efgue Granite, or at a later date, as the porphyritic phase of this granite is locally deformed \ninto augen gneiss. New shears formed and individual shears within the NE-trending shear zone \nof event 2 were re-activated. The growth of amphibole after pyroxene, widespread growth of \nepidote along joint planes, and alteration of biotite to chlorite, and feldspar to sericite indicate \nthat there was at least one regional retrogressive event after the emplacement of the late gran-\nites.  \nOpen folding succeeded ductile shearing. Brittle deformation (equivalent of the Precambrian 3 \nevent of Barr\u00e8re, 1967) produced numerous faults and fractures with NE-SW, E-W and N-S \ntrends. Many of these are infilled by basic dykes and secondary epidote coats joint faces. Re-\npeated brecciation of quartz-mylonites occurred during brittle re-activation of ductile shear \nzones. All of these \u2018late\u2019 tectonic and magmatic events affected the whole of the Reguibat \nShield area of NW Mauritania. \nTasiast-Tijirit Terrane \nPrevious geological mapping in parts of the Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane, notably by Maurin et al. \n(1997) identified migmatitic gneisses and major greenstone belts surrounded by younger, volu-\nminous tonalitic\/granodioritic plutons that commonly core dome-like structures. The green-\nstones and surrounding plutons are absent from the Choum-Rag el Abiod Terrane. Conventional \nRb\/Sr whole rock and mineral ages of between 2.34 and 2.84Ga were previously recorded from \nthis Terrane (Bonnici and Giraudon, 1963; Rocci et al., 1991). Chardon (1997) obtained one \nzircon evaporation age of c. 2.97 Ga from migmatitic gneisses adjacent to the Chami Green-\nstone Belt. All the examined gneisses had Nd model ages in a restricted range of 3.05 to 3.10 \nGa. A similarly determined age of c. 2.93 Ga was obtained from a granodiorite pluton also close \nto the Chami Greenstone Belt and all the plutons have similar Nd model ages to the examined \ngneisses. Felsic volcanics from the Chami Greenstone Belt had Nd model ages from 3.05 to \n3.60 Ga, suggesting involvement of older crustal material in their genesis.  \nOur mapping (Key, 2003; Key & Loughlin, 2003) confirmed the earlier work and identified \nthe oldest rocks as the variably migmatised tonalitic gneisses, one phase of which was dated by \nChardon (1997) at c.2.97 Ga. These gneisses are cut by all the other \u2018granitic\u2019 phases and tec-\ntonically as well as unconformably underlie the greenstone belts. There are a number of small, \nelongate, predominantly amphibolitic units, interpreted as older greenstone belt remnants, \nwithin the tonalitic gneisses. The lithologies that make up the Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane can there-\nfore be divided into the following three major groups (Fig. 5).  \nC folder Geol Soc NOVEMBER 06 file \n04\/08\/2008 8\n\u2022 Migmatitic gneisses with amphibolite lenses (oldest unit) and minor gneissic granite \n\u2022 Greenstone belt lithologies  \n\u2022 Post-greenstone belt granitoid intrusions that include major biotite-\ntonalite\/granodiorites (including plutons with abundant secondary epidote), large gran-\nites and small pegmatitic muscovite-granites that are the youngest intrusions. \nThe charnockites, massive quartzofeldspathic gneisses and sillimanite-garnet-cordierite-\nKfeldspar-gneisses that are major components of the Choum-Rag El Abiod Terrane are notice-\nable by their absence. \nMetamorphic lithologies \nThere are two major textural types of early migmatitic gneiss  - phlebitic and stromatic \n(Mehnert, 1968). Migmatitic gneisses with phlebitic textures (Fig. 6a) comprise a grey tonalitic \ngneiss host cut by at least 4 generations of felsic leucosome comprising intersecting felsic veins \nand diffuse (partial melt) zones all cut by minor metamafic dykes. The various leucosome \nphases comprise over 20% of the rock volume. Thick quartzofeldspathic veins define ptygmatic \nand convoluted folds and mafic layers form surreitic (dilatational) structures. The migmatitic \ngneisses preserve a complex tectono-thermal history that pre-dates deposition of the volcano- \nsedimentary greenstone belts sequences.  \nMigmatites with stromatic textures (Fig. 6b) form two linear, N-S belts on either side of the \nwestern (Kreidat and Chami) greenstone belts. These gneisses have a steeply dipping N-S \ngneissosity on a mm- to cm-scale accentuated by parallel white felsic veins up to about 30cm in \nthickness and which comprise between about 10% and 50% of the rock volume. The gneissosity \nand veins can be followed for tens of metres across large rock pavements parallel to the mean \ntrends of the two outcrop belts. Tight intrafolial folds within the gneissosity show that it is a \ntransposed fabric that effectively obliterated earlier structures. The gneissosity forms an axial \nplanar fabric to cuspate folds defined by discordant fine-grained amphibolite sheets.  \nThe migmatitic gneisses tectonically (and locally unconformably for the Ahmeyim Greenstone \nBelt) underlie the various greenstone lithologies to confirm the schematic cross sections on the \npublished Chami Sheet (Maurin et al., 1997). Larger migmatitic gneiss exposures have antifor-\nmal or dome-like aspects. \nThere are numerous isolated and small amphibolite pods in the migmatitic gneisses. The amphi-\nbolites are invaded by neosome phases of the surrounding migmatites and are older than the \nmetamafic volcanic rocks of the overlying greenstone belts.  \nThe main greenstone belts in the Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane are named as follows, from east to west \n(Fig. 1): \n\u2022 Tijirit Greenstone Belt \nC folder Geol Soc NOVEMBER 06 file \n04\/08\/2008 9\n\u2022 Ahmeyim Greenstone Belt  \n\u2022 Sebkhet Nich Greenstone Belt in the south-east \n\u2022 Kreidat Greenstone Belt in the north-centre \n\u2022 Chami Greenstone Belt in the centre \n\u2022 Two small greenstone belts in the west-centre referred to as the Hudeibt Aghey\u00e2ne and \nHadeibt Lebthein\u00eey\u00e9 greenstone belts (collectively referred to formerly as the Lebzenia \ngreenstone belts). \nThe characteristic feature of the western greenstone belts is their linear aspect parallel to the \nN-S fabric of surrounding stromatic migmatitic gneisses. The eastern greenstones trend NNE-\nSSW parallel to the strike of the TISZ that defines the eastern margin of the Tasiast-Tijirit Ter-\nrane. These linear trends are clearly controlled by major tectonic events described below. All of \nthe greenstone belts comprise interlayered mafic and ultramafic metavolcanic rocks with minor \nuppermost felsic metavolcanics confined to specific eruptive centres (including dated sample D \non Fig. 1\/ Tasiast drillcore sample in Table 1). Chemical analyses of the various greenstone belt \nmetavolcanics (Pitfield et al., 2005) suggest that early mafic and ultramafic rocks were em-\nplaced during initial rifting of continental crust. Siliciclastic metasedimentary rocks as well as \nprominent banded ironstones (Fig. 6c) are either interbanded with the mafic and ultramafic \nrocks (e.g. in the Ahmeyim, Hadeibt Aghey\u00e2ne and Hadeibt Lebthein\u00eey\u00e9 greenstone belts) or \nconfined within rifts in the centres of the greenstone belts (e.g. in the Chami Greenstone Belt).  \nPlutonic rocks  \nA sequence of intrusive events is identified with most pluton-forming magmatism post-\ndating the volcanism and associated sedimentation recorded in the greenstone belts. Pre-\ngreenstone belt plutonism is confined to small, early gneissic granites intruding into migmatites \nin the western part of the Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane. The planar fabric in the early granites is de-\nfined by biotite lenses (~6cm long) and a parallel quartz leaf fabric with flattened feldspars.  \n The commonest intrusions in the Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane are biotite-tonalites (of the Ndaou\u00e2s \nSuite) that form a number of large intrusions west of the Ahmeyim Greenstone Belt. The plu-\ntons cut across fabrics in the migmatitic gneisses and also intrude through folded greenstone belt \nsuccessions. Small country-rock xenoliths generally comprise less than 1% of the rock volume \nbut are locally common, notably immediately adjacent to greenstone belts where abundant \nmetamafic volcanic xenoliths are present. The tonalites are locally foliated and gneissic (in dis-\ncrete shear zones), and are cut by minor granitic vein phases. \nAbundant secondary epidote as veins and as a pervasive replacement phase (of feldspar and bio-\ntite) is present in some of the tonalitic plutons. The largest of these altered plutons occurs at \nGleibat el Fhoud, west of the Ahmeyim Greenstone Belt (zircon sample B on Fig. 1 = sample \nC folder Geol Soc NOVEMBER 06 file \n04\/08\/2008 10\n201401584 of Table 1, is from this pluton). It is a medium to coarse-grained, equigranular leu-\ncocratic rock, locally with euhedral feldspar phenocrysts (partly replaced by epidote) that are up \nto about 5cm in length. The modal composition is close or on the tonalite-granodiorite bound-\nary. The granodioritic to tonalitic plutons of the Ndaou\u00e2s Suite are calc-alkaline granitoids with \nSiO2 contents from 65.8-77.5% and Na2O+K2O values in the interval 5.8-9.1% that range from \nmedium potassic through high potassic to shoshonitic intrusions (Pitfield et al., 2005). \nLess common are granitic intrusions of the Bir Igueni Suite (zircon sample C on Fig. 1 = sample \n201401598 of Table 1, is from one granitic pluton) found in the centre of the Tasiast-Tijirit Ter-\nrane. These plutons have abundant rafts of migmatitic gneiss in white-grey, variably gneissic \nleucogranite that forms a network of criss-crossing veins. The veins form up to 50% of individ-\nual large exposures. A characteristic feature of the veins is the presence of tiny red garnets and \nlarge magnetite grains. The gneiss rafts are variably assimilated and up to tens of cubic metres \nin volume. There is a transitional contact between the granite and its host migmatitic gneiss with \na gradual decrease in the proportion of the granite vein phase. One such granite intrudes into the \nnorth-eastern part of the Sebkhet Nich Greenstone Belt. .  \nA distinctive, coarse-grained to pegmatitic muscovite-granite forms a series of very small intru-\nsions throughout the western part of the Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane. Its pegmatitic phase (that usu-\nally forms sheets and veins cutting all other lithologies of the Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane) is charac-\nterized by a range of unusual lithium, strontium and beryllium minerals as well as opaques, \ntourmaline, biotite and red garnet. Muscovite books in the pegmatites are up to 1m in length. \nThese micaceous granites may be coeval and comagmatic with the (late) muscovite-granites \noccurring in the Choum-Rag el Abiod Terrane and in the TISZ.  \nTectono-thermal events \nThe following sequence of deformation events and associated metamorphism is preserved in the \nrocks of the Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane: \n1. An early set of small-scale folds of gneissosity and ductile shears in the various migmatitic \ngneisses that pre-date the deposition of the greenstone belt sediments and volcanics. An ini-\ntial high-grade event produced gneissic fabrics that are axial planar to folds defined by fel-\nsic veins. The gneissosity (as well as felsic veins and dykes) was then sheared and folded \ninto tight to isoclinal folds. Structures include ptygmatic folds of quartzofeldspathic veins \nand isoclinal folds associated with ductile shears. A lack of indicator minerals precludes ac-\ncurate assessments of the metamorphic grades of these early events. However, partial melt-\ning occurred as indicated by phlebitic textures (Fig. 6a). Subsequent (post-greenstone belt) \ntectonic events have strongly modified the original orientation of the early structures.  \nC folder Geol Soc NOVEMBER 06 file \n04\/08\/2008 11\n2. Early tight to isoclinal folding in the greenstone belt lithologies was accompanied by the \ngeneration of a penetrative foliation and accompanying lineation (Fig. 6d). Greenschist to \namphibolite facies metamorphism accompanied the folding. Ductile shearing in the eastern \npart of the Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane imposed a strong NNE-SSW to NE-SW tectonic grain \n(Fig. 4). By contrast the western part of the Terrane has a strong N-S tectonic grain imposed \nby shearing and transposed planar fabrics. The temporal relation between the two sets of \nshears is not known. \n3. The emplacement of biotite-tonalite plutons modified the structure of the greenstone belts \nand post-dated the tectonic events recorded in the last paragraph producing open domical \nstructures cored by the plutons (for example in the western part of the Kreidat Greenstone \nBelt). Discrete ductile shears locally cut the plutons, notably close to the TISZ. This pe-\nriod(s) of ductile deformation may have been contemporaneous with the late ductile shears \nseen in the Choum-Rag el Abiod Terrane. Regional retrogression is indicated by the wide-\nspread growth of epidote, chlorite and carbonate minerals. Epidote occurs along brittle frac-\ntures and replaces mafic minerals in all of the gneissic and granitic rocks.  Secondary \ngrowth of chlorite and carbonate is widespread in the greenstone belts, notably in metaba-\nsalts.  \n4. Several generations of brittle fractures can be recognized including NE to NNE-trending \nfractures infilled by a sub-continental mafic dyke swarm (that extends eastwards across the \nTISZ and the Choum-Rag el Abiod Terrane). Late brittle fractures are locally infilled by E-\nW trending, brecciated quartz reefs associated with late hydrothermal alteration. Breccias \nalong faults in the greenstone belts locally contain clasts of chlorite schist. \nT\u00e2\u00e7ar\u00e2t -Inemma\u00fbdene Shear Zone (TISZ)  \nFieldwork identified a major curviplanar, NNE to NE-trending ductile shear zone approxi-\nmately 70km wide, that separates the Choum-Rag el Abiod and Tasiast-Tijirit terranes and also \ncuts into the southern exposed part of the Choum-Rag el Abiod Terrane. Anastomizing shears \ndivide the TISZ into five major segments as follows from west to east (Fig. 1).  \n1. There is a foliated granite with mafic xenoliths aligned in its strong planar fabric \nalong the western margin adjacent to the Tijirit Greenstone Belt (Fig. 7a).  \n2.  This is bounded on its eastern side by the T\u00e2\u00e7ar\u00e2t  Suite of strongly foliated granites \nand augen granite gneisses.  \n3.  A central zone is dominated by metamorphic rocks with transposed planar fabrics \n(Fig. 7b). This elongate segment has a core of steeply dipping, foliated to mylonitic, \nflaggy, biotite-bearing quartzofeldspathic (tonalitic) gneisses and quartz-mylonites \nflanked by less steeply dipping sheared lithologies including augen gneisses. The \nC folder Geol Soc NOVEMBER 06 file \n04\/08\/2008 12\ncentral gneisses have porphyroclastic textures with tiny rounded and rotated quartz \ngrains. Amphibolite lenses in the gneisses range in length from several centimeters \nup to hundreds of metres. Less common are lenses of migmatitic gneiss with (trans-\nposed) stromatic textures and isoclinal folds of gneissosity and intrafolial folds \nwithin the gneissosity.  \n4. A wedge of foliated granitic rocks including porphyritic phases of the Aoutitilt Suite \n(dated sample A in Fig. 1 = 201401619 of Table 1) forms an eastern core to the \nTISZ. The porphyritic granites contain up to 5% by volume of angular, dark mafic \nxenoliths up to about 30cm in length and are chemically distinct from other analyzed \ngranites from the adjoining terranes with flat chondrite-normalized REE profiles with \na positive Eu anomaly  (Pitfield et al., 2005). These granites are mostly strongly foli-\nated (biotite fabric) with euhedral feldspar phenocrysts in a medium to coarse-\ngrained groundmass of quartz, feldspar and biotite and less common hornblende. \nStrongly lineated augen gneisses develop where the deformation is most intense. \nQuartz lenses help define the gneissosity with lozenge-shaped mafic layers less than \n10cm in thickness in the gneissic fabric. SC\u2019 fabrics (Passchier & Trouw, 1996) are \ncommon, with an early foliation cut by shear bands (Fig. 7c). Feldspar augen are ro-\ntated and are from one to seven cm in length, set in a generally coarse-grained ma-\ntrix. Some augen are deformed veins rather than individual feldspar grains. Anas-\ntomizing ductile shears locally infilled by pegmatite veins are ubiquitous. Tails to \naugen (\u03c3 clasts; Fig. 7d) imply sinistral rotation in the horizontal plane on the eastern \nside of the \u2018flower structure\u2019. A similar sinistral sense of movement is also indicated \nby the arrangement of individual shears and by SC\u2019 fabrics in augen gneisses (Fig. \n7c).  \n5. The eastern part of the TISZ, as well as a NE-trending offshoot, comprises tectoni-\ncally interleaved rocks derived from the Choum-Rag el Abiod Terrane. Small-scale \nmovement indicators (including SC\u2019 fabrics in augen granite gneiss) confirm sinistral \nhorizontal offset along, and east-directed thrusting across, the eastern part of this \ntranspressive, fundamental deformation zone. \nAn E-W cross section across the southern part of the shear zone demonstrates the presence of a \n\u2018flower structure\u2019 (Fig. 8). Further north, foliation planes dip consistently westwards across the \nTISZ at between about 35\u00ba and 80\u00ba. The grade of the metamorphism that accompanied the \nshearing is inferred to be in the greenschist to amphibolite facies based on the presence of horn-\nblende in sheared mafic rocks and biotite (C\u2019) fabrics in augen granite gneisses. Epidote coats \njoint surfaces, notably in granitic rocks.  \nC folder Geol Soc NOVEMBER 06 file \n04\/08\/2008 13\nGeochronology and isotope geochemistry \nAll U-Pb ages reported in this paper are single-zircon analyses conducted by isotope-\ndilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry at the NERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory, \nUK (Table 1). Zircon separates were prepared following standard separation techniques includ-\ning density separation using heavy liquids and magnetic separation to select the least magnetic, \nleast included, non-metamict zircons. The zircons were hand picked under alcohol using a high-\nquality binocular microscope to select the best grains for analysis, discriminating populations by \nvirtue of morphology, size, visible cores, etc. Selected grains were rigorously abraded using the \nair abrasion technique of Krogh (1982) to reduce the likelihood of Pb-loss and rim phases caus-\ning discordance and mixing of age components. U-Pb analyses on single zircons were carried \nout using a 205Pb\/235U mixed spike solution following the procedures of Krogh (1973) and Par-\nrish (1987) with modifications after Corfu & Noble (1992). Analyses were conducted on a VG \n354 multi-collector thermal ionisation mass spectrometer (TIMS) equipped with a WARP filter, \naxial Daly photomultiplier and Ortec ion counting detection system, or using a Thermo-\nFinnegan Triton multi-collector TIMS instrument fitted with an axial electron multiplier. Ages \nand errors were determined using the Isoplot 3 macro of Ludwig (2003) using the uranium de-\ncay constants of Jaffey et al (1971) and common-Pb is corrected using a Stacey & Kramers \n(1975) two-stage model lead evolution curve. \nThe residue remaining after ion exchange separation of U and Pb, was evaporated to incipi-\nent dryness and redissolved in 2% HNO3-0.1M HF ready for Hf isotope analysis by multi-\ncollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) following a procedure \nmodified after Nowell & Parrish (2000). A Thermo-Elemental Axiom MC-ICP-MS was used, \ncoupled to a Cetac Technologies Aridus desolvating nebuliser. Corrections for Lu and Yb iso-\nbaric interferences were determined and applied following Nowell & Parrish (2000). Data were \nnormalised to equivalent washes of the 91500 zircon standard prepared at the same time, ac-\ncording to 176Hf\/177Hf and 176Lu\/177Hf values of 0.282284 and 0.000288 (Wiedenbeck et al., \n1995) respectively. Data are presented in Table 2. \nSm and Nd concentrations were obtained by isotope dilution using a mixed 149Sm-150Nd \nspike solution. Double filament assemblies comprising tantalum (evaporation) and rhenium \n(ionisation) filaments were used to run the samples, with analyses conducted on a Finnigan-\nMAT 262 multi-collector TIMS instrument. Further details of methodology can be found in \nDarbyshire & Sewell (1997). Data are presented in Table 3. \nData interpretation \nDespite efforts to improve the concordancy of the analyzed zircon crystals through careful \nhand picking and air abrasion techniques, the majority of the zircons were poor in quality which \nC folder Geol Soc NOVEMBER 06 file \n04\/08\/2008 14\nis reflected in the largely discordant data sets displayed below. This is not atypical of Archaean \nand Proterozoic terrains. At the time of writing a chemical abrasion methodology (Mattinson, \n2005) is now employed at NIGL which helps improves concordancy of ancient and high-U zir-\ncons. \nZircons from a sample of augen granite gneiss (sample 201401619 in Table 1) within the \nTISZ were red-brown in colour, variably cracked and included and possessed obvious cores un-\nder an optical microscope. Care was taken to avoid visible cores and pick the least included and \ncracked grains for single grain U-Pb analysis. Despite this, all analyzed fractions exhibited Pb-\nloss (up to 10%) but still formed a reasonable regression with upper intercept of 2954 +\/- 11Ma \n(MSWD = 6.1, Fig. 9A). The co-linearity of these four discordant data points argues against the \nvariable inclusion of inherited cores. Instead, a magmatic interpretation of this age provides a \nmaximum age for the ductile shearing within the TISZ.  Since all four fractions were interpreted \nto be of the same age, all four wash fractions were combined for Hf isotope analysis. The data \n(Hf TDM = 3062 \u00b1 87Ma and \u03b5Hft = 3.1 \u00b1 2.4 (2 \u03c3)) suggest derivation from a depleted mantle \nsource with little if any contamination, contrasting with the cored nature of the zircons and the \nNd isotope data (Nd TDM = 3204Ma and \u03b5Nd = -0.7), which reflect an inherited component. \nThis apparent decoupling of the Hf and Nd isotope data can be explained via the fact that the \ndominant sink for Hf in a melt is zircon. The refractory nature of zircon means that the Hf sig-\nnature of a contaminant melt is largely \u2018locked\u2019 into its zircons which may not be resorbed into \nthe host melt, especially if this melt is saturated with respect to Zr. Crystallization of new zircon \nwill therefore reflect the Hf isotope composition and source of the host melt rather than the \nmelt-contaminant mix whereas the Nd isotope signature will reflect the bulk-rock mixing with \nthe contaminant. Since none of the cored zircons were selected for U-Pb\/Hf analysis, the two Hf \ncomponents can be resolved as different to the whole rock Nd data, and the Hf isotope data are \nconsidered to indicate the source of the 2954Ma melt.  \nThe zircons from an epidotised tonalite of the Ndaou\u00e2s Suite (sample 201401584 in Table 1) \nwere pink to yellow-brown in colour with a prismatic (classic tetragonal) to elongate prismatic \nhabit. No obvious cores or inclusions were apparent. Four U-Pb TIMS data points were strongly \ndiscordant (19-31%), forming a discordia with an upper intercept of 2912 \u00b1 35 (MSWD = 10.7, \nFig. 9B). The strong discordance of these data means caution should be exercised in interpreting \nthe upper intercept age and as such it is simply noted that the age of this sample is within error \nof sample 201401598 (see below). The same similarity exists in the Hf (Hf TDM = 3075Ma, \u03b5Hft \n= 1.8 \u00b1 1.8 (2 \u03c3)) and Nd (Nd TDM = 3079Ma, \u03b5Ndt = 0.6) isotope geochemistry, suggesting a \ncommon origin for these two intrusions. \nC folder Geol Soc NOVEMBER 06 file \n04\/08\/2008 15\nA granite pluton from the Bir Igueni Suite of the Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane (sample 201401598 \nin Table 1) yielded mostly elongate prismatic grains with aspect ratio c.4:1, pink to brown-red \nin colour with some smaller, stubbier multi-faceted grains. Milky, high-U overgrowths were \napparent on some grains; these were avoided in preference for the clearer, more crystalline pink-\ncoloured grains. Four data points form a discordia with an upper intercept of 2933 \u00b1 16Ma with \nMSWD = 12 (Fig. 9C). The regression has a very high MSWD indicating excess scatter but this \nis pinned relatively near Concordia (1-2% discordant) by two data points, lending confidence to \nthe final upper intercept age. All four Hf fractions were combined to maximize the amount of Hf \nanalyzed. The data (Hf TDM = 3029 \u00b1 70Ma, \u03b5Hft = 3.5 \u00b1 1.9 (2\u03c3)) indicate a depleted mantle \norigin for the melt whilst the Nd isotope data (Nd TDM = 3066Ma, \u03b5Ndt = 1.1) indicate a small \namount of crustal assimilation. This is in agreement with the Nd model age data of Chardon \n(1997) for a 2.93Ga granodioritic pluton from the same area. \nAnalysis of zircons from a felsic metavolcanic rock (Tasiast drillcore in Table 1) from the \n(upper) Aou\u00e9oua Formation of the Chami Greenstone Belt in the Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane yielded \ndata from only 3 small, prismatic, mauve-coloured zircon crystals after processing of more than \n50kg of drill core. These crystals were isolated after removing plentiful pyrite present in the \nsample. All three data points are discordant (Fig. 9D) with one sub-concordant. Due to the lack \nof co-linearity, the best estimate for the age of the rock is given by the 207Pb\/206Pb age of the \nmost concordant point. This represents a minimum age for the rock at c.2965Ma. The small size \nof the zircons provided little Hf for isotopic analysis and as such no data are presented for this \nsample in Table 2. The Nd isotope results (Nd TDM = 2996Ma; \u03b5Ndt = 2.5) suggest this volcanic \nrock was derived directly from a depleted mantle source with little or no crustal contamination.  \nSince field and petrographic evidence for the origin of this volcanic rock is ambiguous, the \npossibility exists that these zircons may all be inherited and that none represents the age of the \nrock. However, a crosscutting relationship with sample 201401598 (see below) constrains the \nminimum age of this rock at 2933Ma. Chardon (1997) also obtained a similar (Pb-Pb) age \n(c.2.97Ga) and Nd isotope data for associated migmatitic gneisses in this area, which uncon-\nformably underlie the greenstone belts.  The weight of evidence therefore suggests strongly, that \nthe interpretation of an eruption age of c.2965Ma for this Chami Greenstone Belt volcanic is \ncorrect. This also provides an upper age limit on the greenstone belt volcanism and associated \nsedimentation.  \nDiscussion and conclusion  \nThe Reguibat Shield in NW Mauritania comprises two terranes that are lithologically differ-\nent and preserve different Mesoarchaean geological histories indicative of different geotectonic \nC folder Geol Soc NOVEMBER 06 file \n04\/08\/2008 16\nsettings (Table 4). Both terranes have migmatitic orthogneisses as their oldest components. \nThese gneisses have previously been dated at 3.5-3.45 Ga in the Choum-Rag el Abiod Terrane, \nwith a single zircon evaporation age of 2.97 Ga for migmatitic gneisses of the Tasiast-Tijirit \nTerrane with Nd model ages of 3.05-3.10 Ga. However, there is evidence for a c. 3.6 Ga crustal \ncomponent based on a Nd model age signature for the dated felsic volcanic from the Chami \nGreenstone Belt emplaced through migmatitic gneisses. A siliciclastic supracrustal sequence of \nquartzofeldspathic gneisses that includes 2.99 Ga charnockite sheets dominates the Mesoar-\nchaean geology of the Choum-Rag el Abiod Terrane. In contrast, a classic c. 2.93-2.97 Ga gran-\nite-greenstone belt sequence characterizes the Mesoarchaean geological record of the Tasiast-\nTijirit Terrane. In this respect the Reguibat Shield of NW Mauritania resembles the Superior \nprovince of the Canadian Shield where Archaean subprovinces and terranes characterized by \ngranite-greenstone assemblages are tectonically juxtaposed with Archaean metasedimentary \nsubprovinces and terranes (Card & Ciesielski, 1986; Davis et al., 2005).  \nThe granite-greenstone belt sequences of the Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane preserve voluminous \ncalc-alkaline magmatism sourced from a depleted mantle with minor crustal contamination and \nrift-related sedimentation. The Mesoarchaean siliciclastic supracrustals of the Choum-Rag el \nAbiod Terrane may originally have been deposited as passive margin (accretionary prism) \nsediments and as such would support an interpretation that the two terranes were allochthonous \nto each other prior to their amalgamation along the TISZ.  Granulite facies Mesoarchaean \nparagneisses are exposed in the Choum-Rag el Abiod Terrane whereas the exposed Mesoar-\nchaean rocks of the Tasiast Tijirit Terrane are of greenschist facies metamorphic grade. These \ntwo assemblages represent different (lower vs mid to upper) crustal levels. However, the \nstrongly contrasting Mesoarchaean geotectonic setting of the two terranes precludes an interpre-\ntation that they represent delamination between lower and middle crustal levels of a single ter-\nrane with the T\u00e2\u00e7ar\u00e2t-Inemma\u00fbdene Shear Zone (TISZ) as an intra-terrane structure. The meas-\nured transpressive character of the TISZ reflects post-amalgamation movement and in this re-\nspect is a typical post-collisional transpressive shear zone (Li\u00e9geois et al., 1998). Cross sections \nof the TISZ show an an E-W \u2018flower structure\u2019 across its southern part with sinistral horizontal \noffset and east-directed thrusting on its eastern side. Further north, shear-related fabrics dip con-\nsistently westwards to indicate that the Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane lies tectonically above the \nChoum-Rag el Abiod Terrane.  \nWidespread Neoarchaean granitic (and less common basic) magmatism throughout the \nReguibat Shield followed transpressive movement along the TISZ. The c.2730 Ma age for the \npost-TISZ Touijenjert-Modre\u00efgue Granite (Potrel et al., 1998) of the Choum-Rag el Abiod Ter-\nC folder Geol Soc NOVEMBER 06 file \n04\/08\/2008 17\nrane provides a minimum age for the shearing. A maximum age for the shearing is provided by \nthe 2954\u00b111 Ma magmatic age for an Aoutitilt Suite granite from the eastern core of the TISZ.  \nThe original size of the two terranes is not known. The present western limit of the Tasiast-\nTijirit Terrane is defined by the Pan-African (late Proterozoic-early Phanerozoic) NW Mauri-\ntanides that lie about 230km west of the TISZ.  Only about 50-70km of the Choum-Rag el \nAbiod Terrane is exposed east of the TISZ before it is concealed beneath unconformably over-\nlying strata of the Taoudeni Basin. Elsewhere on the African Plate, Archaean terranes that are \nup to about 800km by 200km in area are recognized within the Kaapvaal Craton (Eglington & \nArmstrong, 2004; de Wit & Tinker, 2004 and references therein).  \nAcknowledgements \nThe work described in this paper formed part of the World Bank-funded PRISM Project of \nthe Government of Mauritania and the authors wish to thank Mr. Samory, the Project Coordina-\ntor for all his logistical support.
