It lends support\nto policy initiatives such as the recently enforced EU directive on participation at work, which aims to increase\njob control and autonomy.\nT\nhe workplace, particularly the psychosocial work environ-\nment, is increasingly being considered by policy-makers as\nan important intervention point at which health can be\nimproved and health inequalities reduced.1 2 The demand\u2013\ncontrol\u2013support model of the role of stressful psychosocial work\nenvironments on the health of employees has dominated the\nresearch literature3 4 (although it has not been without\ncriticism, not least from advocates of the effort\u2013reward\nimbalance model).5 Karasek4 initially developed a two-dimen-\nsional concept of work-related stress in which the culmination\nof high psychological work demands and low job task control\n(low level of decision authority and low level of skill utilisation)\nincreased work-related stress, subsequently producing higher\nrates of psychological and physical morbidity. Support from\ncolleagues and supervisors has been suggested as a possible\nmediating factor in the relationship between high work\ndemands, low job control and work-related stress.6\nEpidemiological research, especially from the Whitehall\nstudies, has suggested a relationship between the psychosocial\nwork environment, work-related stress and inequalities in\nhealth status.7 8 Adverse health outcomes, including increased\nrisk of heart disease,7 9\u201311 musculoskeletal pain12 and poor\nmental health,13 and increased sickness absence,14 have been\nassociated with high work demands and low job control. It has\nalso been suggested that enhanced social support in the\nworkplace may reduce these negative consequences.6 15\nAlthough empirical research has generally confirmed the\ndemand\u2013control\u2013support model\u2019s basic assumptions, some\nresearchers prioritise specific parts of the model (e.g. suggesting\nthat control may have stronger associations with health than\ndemands).16\u201318 Furthermore, concerns remain as to whether\nother factors (most notably income) may override the influence\nof psychosocial factors on health.19\u201322 Similarly, further inves-\ntigation is necessary to examine the\ninter-relationship between demand, control and support.21 The\nmodel is therefore usually considered to be descriptive rather\nthan prescriptive. However, the potential clearly exists for\ninterventions that modify the psychosocial work environment\n(by increasing or decreasing levels of demand, control or\nsupport) to also have positive or negative impacts on employee\nhealth.\nPotential intervention points centre either on the individual\n(e.g. enhancing personal coping mechanisms) or on the\nreorganisation of the workplace at the macro or micro level.23\nMacro interventions change the levels of participation in\ndecision-making,24 whilst micro-environment interventions\nchange the structure of work tasks. Karasek identified three\ntypes of task structure interventions (box 1): job enrichment\nand enlargement (task variety); collective coping and decision-\nmaking (teamworking); and the use of autonomous production\ngroups (autonomous groups).\nIn our companion paper,24 we found that macro-level work\nreorganisation interventions that increased control had positive\nhealth effects. However, Karasek suggested that macro and\nmicro workplace interventions may have differing psychosocial,\nand therefore health, outcomes.23 In this paper, then, we extend\nour analysis of the psychosocial work environment by present-\ning the results of a systematic review of the health impacts of\nreorganisation interventions that alter the micro, task structure,\nenvironment. Based on Karasek, it is hypothesised that task-\nrestructuring interventions will improve levels of control and\nsupport although, in line with the characteristics of more active\njobs, demands may also be high.23 Interventions that improve\nthe psychosocial work environment in this way are predicted to\nhave a beneficial effect on health, particularly mental health,\nwhile, conversely, interventions that result in higher demand\nand lower control are predicted to have an adverse effect on\nhealth outcomes.\n1028\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nAlthough previous literature reviews exist in this area,\nthese often cover only specific occupations or one type of\ntask-restructuring intervention, and have not been conducted\nusing the systematic review methodology.25 This is therefore the\nfirst systematic review of the health effects of changes to the\npsychosocial work environment brought about by reorganisa-\ntion of the work task structure. It offers the opportunity to\nexamine the health effects of changes to the psychosocial work\nenvironment brought about by task structure work reorganisa-\ntion, and whether those effects differ for different socio-\neconomic groups. It also facilitates contrasts with the effects of\nmacro-level reorganisation interventions.24\nMETHODS\nInclusion and exclusion\nThe review sought to identify all experimental and quasi-\nexperimental studies that examined the effects on health of\ninterventions which reorganised work task structures. The\nreview included all task structure interventions that fell into\none of Karasek\u2019s three clusters: task variety, teamworking and\nautonomous groups.23 Work reorganisation interventions based\non the demand\u2013control\u2013support model and those motivated by\neconomic or managerial reasons were all included. Only studies\nthat included measures of both the psychosocial work\nenvironment (demand, control or support) and health were\nBox 1 Descriptions of the task-restructuring interventions located by the\nreview\nTask variety\nInterventions of this type increase the skills utilised by workers by increasing the variety of work\ntasks which are required as part of their jobs.\nPrimary nursing33\u201336\nPrimary nursing and personal care-giving are patient-orientated care systems in which each\npatient is assigned to an individual nurse\/carer who takes 24-h responsibility for the care of that\npatient, including the planning and quality of the care provided. Care is therefore based on patient\nneed rather than on the needs of the nursing ward. The intervention in this case aims to increase the\nvariety of tasks undertaken by the nurses\/carers and, according to the literature, it indirectly\nincreases the decision latitude, autonomy and control of the nurse.\nProduction line32 37\u201340\nProduction line interventions increase the variety of tasks performed by a worker, increase the skills\nutilised and place more responsibility on individual workers. Typically, individual workers are\nencouraged to be involved in a set of tasks requiring a wider variety of skills, instead of being\nresponsible for a single task and reliant on a small range of skills.\nTeamworking32 37 40\u201347\nWorkers are given more collective responsibility and decision-making power. However, workers\nare still individualised, responsibility is not shared and supervisory structures remain in place. This\nintervention type is also designed to enhance collective coping and provide support within the\nworkplace. Teamworking interventions can occur in any work environment.\nAutonomous groups\nThis intervention type is specific to mass production environments, where it is often used to reduce\nthe prevalence of traditional production line characteristics (such as individualised, repetitive tasks)\nby increasing skill variety and collective involvement. It combines aspects of job enrichment and\nteamworking as well as increased worker participation (within-group democracy).\n\u2018\u2018Lean production\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018just in time\u2019\u201948\u201351\nLean production originated in Japan. It is intended to improve efficiency, quality and\nresponsiveness. Employee workloads are maximised (tasks and responsibilities), wasted time is\nreduced, tasks are distributed within the team, and work standards are determined by the\nemployees themselves rather than solely by management. Group responsibility also extends\nbeyond production, to the maintenance and running of the production machines, so that\nemployees are also involved in problem-solving and ensuring quality.\n\u2018\u2018Just in time\u2019\u2019 requires that products are made \u2018\u2018just in time\u2019\u2019 to be sold, i.e. stockpiling of\nproducts is avoided. This ethos dominates each level of the production process and every work\ntask: each aspect of the product is to be finished just in time for the next. Each stage is triggered by\ndemand from the next; it is therefore a pull system rather than the traditional push system, in which\nproduction is determined by the availability of labour or materials. Work groups, not individuals,\nare given autonomy and responsibility for specific tasks in order to achieve the required production\nflow.\nAutonomous work groups31 52\nAutonomous workgroups are characterised by employee self-determination and involvement in\nthe management of day-to-day work (including control over pace, task distribution and training\nand recruitment). Workplace democracy is also a factor as supervisors are usually replaced by\nelected \u2018\u2018team champions\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018contact people\u2019\u2019, accountable to the groups.\nThe psychosocial and health effects of workplace reorganisation paper 2 1029\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nincluded in the review. Health outcomes included specific\ndiseases as well as more general measures of physical health\nand psychological well-being. Impacts on health inequalities\nwere also considered as outcomes. Studies that focused only on\nworkplace injuries or accidents were excluded, as were those\nthat did not report on the psychosocial work environment\nbeyond job satisfaction measures.\nSearch strategy\nWe searched electronic databases, bibliographies and websites\nfor documents of any type and in any language (full search\nstrategy available from protocol at http:\/\/www.msoc-mrc.gla.\nac.uk\/Evidence\/Research\/Research_MAIN.html). We searched\nthe following 17 databases from start date to December 2006\n(hosts given in parentheses): ASSIA (CSA), Conference Papers\nIndex (CSA), Business Source Premier, Dissertation abstracts,\nEconlit (Dialog), Embase (Dialog\/Ovid), ERIC Firstsearch\/CSA),\nElectronic Collections Online (OCLC firstsearch), Index to\ntheses, Medline (Ovid\/Dialog), NTIS (free version), PAIS\n(Dialog), Psycinfo (Dialog\/Ovid), SIGLE, Sociological abstracts\n(CSA), Social Sciences Citation Index (MIMAS), Zetoc and\nvarious internet sources. We also manually searched biblio-\ngraphies and contacted experts.\nWe initially located 68 737 titles and abstracts, of which 734\nwere retrieved for full analysis. All papers reporting the results\nof an empirical study of the effects on health of interventions\nthat changed the structure of work tasks were independently\nassessed by two reviewers (C.B. and M.E.) for relevance and\nmethodological quality.\nCritical appraisal and data extraction\nCritical appraisal criteria were adapted from previous systematic\nreviews of public health interventions and existing guidance for\nthe evaluation of non-randomised studies.26\u201330 Two reviewers\nindependently appraised the included studies according to these\ncriteria (box 2). Data were abstracted by one reviewer (S.T.) and\nchecked by a second (C.B.). We included percentages, confidence\nintervals (CIs), p values and effect sizes when they were reported\nin the original study or calculated these statistics (using final\nsample sizes) if sufficient information was available.\nRESULTS\nNineteen different studies were located, the earliest dated from\n1986.31 Thirteen studies were located from electronic databases\nand the other six were identified from citation follow-ups.\nEight studies examined task variety,32\u201340 seven examined\nteamworking,41\u201347 and six examined autonomous groups.31 48\u201352\nTwo of the studies examined interventions that entailed both\nchanges to task variety and increased teamworking,32 37 40 and\nmany of the other studies were conducted in the context of\nmacro-environment work reorganisations.24 Health was mea-\nsured on a self-reported basis in all but two of the studies.41 52\nThe psychosocial outcome measures were also self-reported,\nwith employees asked to rate their sense of demand, control or\nsupport, or other similar psychosocial characteristics (e.g. work\nautonomy for control). In all but six of the studies,31 32 35 37 41\u201343 52\nthe work reorganisation was motivated by economic or manage-\nrial reasons. Fourteen prospective cohorts and five repeat cross-\nsectional studies were found. Ten of the studies used a comparison\ngroup (workers from a different department in the same\nworkplace or from a similar worksite) and two of the studies\nalso had qualitative elements.40 44 Results are presented by\nintervention type in tables 1 to 3.\nTask variety\nEight studies32\u201340 examined changes to task variety (table 1),\nfour in health care settings33\u201336 and four in production line\nsettings.32 37\u201340\nHealth care\nFour cohort studies,33\u201336 one of which was motivated out of\nconcern for employee health,35 reported on increased task\nvariety amongst Dutch nurses. All of the studies were\nprospective and had comparison groups, although the quality\nof the comparison groups was a cause of concern. For example,\nin one study the comparison group became a second interven-\ntion group after 6 months.33 In contrast to the stated aims, the\ninterventions did not significantly alter the psychosocial work-\ning environment: in three studies33 35 36 there were no changes\nin support (as assessed by the Boumans Questionnaire,33 de\nJonge scale 36 and the Maslach Burnout Inventory35), and in the\nBerkhout et al. study job autonomy (control) and work\ndemands were also unchanged.36 In the other study,34 only\nclarity (control) and satisfaction with management (support)\nwere higher in the intervention group (Boumans\nQuestionnaire). There were few health effects: in the\nBoumans and Landerweerd study(33) and the Berkhout et al.\nstudy,36 reported health complaints (assessed by the Dutch\nVOEG scale33 and the Dirkin Questionnaire36) decreased\nslightly; while emotional exhaustion (Maslach Burnout\nInventory) did not change significantly in either the Boumans\nand Berg34 or the Melchor35 studies.\nProduction line\nFour production line studies were located,32 37\u201340 one of which\nreported on an intervention which intended to decrease, rather\nthan increase, task variety.40 Two of the studies32 37 40 also involved\nteamwork (see next section). Only one intervention32 37 was\ndesigned to improve the psychosocial work environment; the\nothers were initiated to increase productivity.38\u201340\nIn the prospective cohort study (with comparison group) of\nSwedish postal workers,32 37 demands decreased, job control\nwas unchanged, and social support increased (as assessed by\nthe Job Content Questionnaire). The study found a decrease in\nreports of shoulder and thoracic musculoskeletal symptoms\n(Nordic questionnaire on musculoskeletal complaints). Two\nother prospective cohort studies examined increased task\nvariety created by computerising the production system.38 39\nBox 2 Critical appraisal criteria for assessing\nstudy quality26\u201330\nN Is the study prospective?\nN Is there a representative sample?\nN Is there an appropriate control group?\nN Is the baseline response greater than 60%?\nN Is the follow-up greater than 80% in a cohort study or\ngreater than 60% in a cross-sectional study?\nN Have the authors adjusted for non-response and drop-\nout?\nN Are the authors\u2019 conclusions substantiated by the data\npresented?\nN Is there adjustment for confounders?\nN Were the entire intervention group exposed to the\nintervention?\nN Was there any contamination between the intervention\nand control groups?\nN Were appropriate statistical tests used?\n1030 Bambra, Egan, Thomas, et al\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nThe UK study reported a significant decrease in self-reported\njob pressure (Warr et al.

They reported an improved work environment:\ndemand decreased and social support increased in the\nprospective study with a comparison group (outlined\nabove),32 37 whilst job control in terms of skill discretion and\nauthority increased (measured with the Job Content\nQuestionnaire) in a prospective cohort study by Wahlstedt\nand Edling,42 43 and decreased in Fredriksson and colleagues\u2019\nprospective cohort study of task variety reduction.40 Health\nchanges were also evident: musculoskeletal symptoms\ndecreased in one study32 37 and increased in another,40 whilst\nsick leave was significantly reduced in the Wahlstedt and\nEdling study.42 43 In contrast, the Japanese prospective cohort\nstudy with a comparison group41 found little change in\npsychosocial outcomes, as measured using Zung self-rating\ndepression score, but still reported a reduction in sick leave and\ndepression amongst men.\nMixed-grade employees\nOne Austrian prospective cohort study of work reorganisation\nin a local government office44 found no significant changes in\nself-reported job control or social support for the sample as a\nwhole (Sainfort Perceived Job Resources Scale). Nonetheless,\nthose in the lowest occupational grades had adverse health\noutcomes (measured with the Weyer Questionnaire): perceived\nstress, emotional strain and tiredness increased amongst\ncustomer service advisers and tiredness increased amongst\nadministrators, but there were no significant changes in\nperceived stress, emotional strain or tiredness amongst man-\nagers. It is possible that this was a result of the poor\nimplementation of the intervention by management and the\nbroader context of organisational change in which this\nintervention took place (table 2).\nProfessional employees\nTwo related cross-sectional studies45\u201347 examined the increase in\nteamwork that resulted after a change in contract, working hours\nand job roles amongst UK doctors. The earlier prospective repeat\ncross-sectional study45 46 found increased demands, decreased\ncontrol and increased social support (Warr Job Satisfaction Scale\nand Cooper Job Stress Questionnaire) (Table 3). In terms of self-\nreported health (Crown\u2013Crisp experimental index), men and\nwomen reported an increase in anxiety, somatic anxiety and\ndepression. The linked retrospective cross-section47 found that, 7\nyears on, levels of control (Warr and Cooper scales) were still\nlower than before the reorganisation, and that the increase in\nsupport identified in the earlier study no longer existed. Taken\ntogether, the two studies suggest that teamworking increased\nsupport only in the short term, and that support did not\ncompensate for the adverse health effects of decreased control\nand increased demands.\nAutonomous groups\nSix studies were located which examined the introduction of\nmore autonomous production groups into factory-based mass\nproduction systems (table 3). Lean production48 49 and \u2018\u2018just in\ntime\u2019\u201950 51 were production efficiency interventions, whilst the\nautonomous work groups31 52 were also motivated by job\nredesign31 or the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders.52\nLean production and \u2018\u2018just in time\u2019\u2019\nBoth of the UK studies of lean production interventions48 49\nfound that control and autonomy deteriorated (as measured by\nthe Jackson et al. Task Control, Skill Utilisation and Work\nDemands Scales). In the prospective cohort study with\ncomparison group by Parker,48 job autonomy and skill utilisa-\ntion decreased amongst all three intervention groups, and\nparticipation also decreased in two. Job anxiety and depression\n(Warr Job Related Anxiety Scale) increased in all three groups\n(table 3). In the retrospective cross-sectional study with\ncomparison group,49 individual and collective timing control\ndeteriorated, and problem-solving, skill utilisation and mon-\nitoring demands also worsened (i.e. increased), while social\ncontact and trust improved. However, there was no difference\nin the Warr Scale measure of job-related strain. This lack of\nadverse effect may be linked to the reported enhanced pay of\nthe intervention group.49\nThe psychosocial effects of the UK prospective cohort study\nwith comparison group50 of a \u2018\u2018just in time\u2019\u2019 intervention were\nrather mixed as, for example, whilst production demand\nincreased there were no changes in monitoring demand\n(measured using the Jackson et al. scales). Similarly, in the\nprospective repeat cross-section, monitoring demands increased\nbut problem-solving demands did not (Wall et al. Work\nDemands Scale). Co-worker support and group cohesiveness\ndid increase (Jackson Group Climate Scale).51 However, neither\nstudy found any significant effects on mental health (measured\nusing GHQ-12). It should be noted that the \u2018\u2018just in time\u2019\u2019\ninterventions generally made only minor changes to the\npsychosocial work environment, so would not be expected to\nhave a sizeable impact on health.\nAutonomous work groups\nTwo studies, one a UK-based prospective cohort study (initially\nwith a comparison group but without after 18 months)31 and\nthe other a prospective repeat cross-section from Sweden,52\nexamined the introduction of autonomous work groups.\nAutonomy and control increased in both studies, and support\ndecreased in one52 (measured using Warr et al.31 and\nRubenowitz52 Attitudes to Work Scales) (table 3). Mental\nhealth (GHQ-12) improved in the short term (after 6 months)\nbut not in the longer term (after 30 months) in the UK study,31\nsuggesting that the health effects of enhanced control may only\nbe short-lived in certain settings. Musculoskeletal health\n(assessed via medical history and clinical examination)\ndeteriorated in the other study.52 This intervention increased\ncontrol but health still deteriorated. This result may be due to\nthe study designs and the influence of other factors such as\npsychological demands (unmeasured in the cohort study),\nphysical workloads (not adjusted for in the repeat cross-\nsectional study) or the reduction in levels of social support.52\nDISCUSSION\nEffects of the interventions\nIn summary, those interventions that improved the psycho-\nsocial work environment by increasing task variety either had\nno effect (primary nursing) or had a limited positive effect\n(production line) on health. The teamworking interventions\ntended to improve the psychosocial work environment in most\nstudies, although not for all workers, but the health effects\nwere less apparent. The autonomous work groups, contrary to\nthe stated aims of such interventions, caused deterioration in\nthe psychosocial work environment, and, as would be\npredicted from the demand\u2013control\u2013support model, the\nresulting health effects were correspondingly adverse, though\nin some cases they were negligible. It is important to note that\nsome interventions did not greatly alter the psychosocial work\nenvironment at all, and so could not be expected to have a\nmeasurable effect on health. This may have been due to poor\nimplementation of the interventions or, in some cases,\n1034 Bambra, Egan, Thomas, et al\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nbecause of concurrent negative changes occurring in the wider\nwork environment (tables 1\u20133).23 It may also be simply\nbecause some of the task-restructuring interventions were not\nsubstantial enough to alter the psychosocial work environ-\nment.23\nChange in the level of control appeared to be a more\nimportant factor than change in support. Those interventions\nthat did achieve alterations in levels of control tended to report\nsignificant changes in self-reported mental and physical\nhealth:34 40\u201348 52 in line with predictions, decreased levels of\ncontrol almost invariably resulted in adverse health out-\ncomes40 44\u201348 and, albeit to a lesser extent, increased levels of\ncontrol resulted in improved health outcomes.31 42 43 In all but\none study,49 interventions that increased support, whilst\ndemands were increased and control decreased, still reported\nadverse health consequences.44\u201347 In terms of study design, in\nthree of the seven prospective cohort studies with a comparison\ngroup and four of the nine other studies in which the\nintervention changed the psychosocial work environment,\nhealth outcomes also changed. When the interventions\nincreased demand and decreased control, this negatively\naffected health, in keeping with the results of epidemiological\nresearch and predictions based on the demand\u2013control\u2013support\nmodel.7\u201314 Increases to workplace support had minimal mediat-\ning effects.\nSome interventions failed to bring about a measurable\nchange in the psychosocial work environment33 36 41 whilst\nothers made the environment worse.34 44\u201349 The majority of the\ninterventions that we reviewed were introduced for economic\nor managerial reasons rather than as attempts to apply the\ndemand\u2013control\u2013support model to the workplace to improve\nemployee health. Those studies in which the motivation was\nemployee well-being tended to have more positive psychosocial\nand health effects,32 37 41\u201343 whilst the effects of those that were\nthe most overtly driven by economics were negative or\nnegligible in relation to health outcomes.31 48\u201351\nImplementation may also have been a problem as we cannot\nbe sure that the interventions actually did increase task variety,\nteamworking or group autonomy. It was not always clear from\nthe reporting of the studies if employees or managers were\nsupportive of the intervention, or involved in its delivery.\nFurthermore, as Karasek has suggested, micro-level restructur-\ning may be vulnerable to the wider constraints of the macro\nwork environment. The interventions that tended to have more\npositive psychosocial and health effects were those in which the\nmacro-environment was also more positive to employee control\nand involvement.41\u201343 This suggests that work reorganisation\nthat ignores possible health impact may in fact be health\ndamaging.\nThe studies provide little insight into the differing effects of\ntask restructuring interventions by gender or socioeconomic\nstatus. Only one study differentiated by socioeconomic status.44\nIt found that the adverse health effects of the intervention were\nfelt only by the lowest-grade employees. However, the inter-\nvention was poorly implemented and the study lacked a\ncomparison group. In one study of a teamworking interven-\ntion,41 depression levels improved only in men, but in another\nteamworking study45 46 no differences were found between men\nand women in terms of anxiety or depression.\nResearch implications\nThis systematic review suggests that micro-level interventions\nthat change the psychosocial work environment affect health in\nthe direction predicted by the demand\u2013control\u2013support model.\nHowever, the evidence base is only partial and the studies we\nhave synthesised were subject to a number of methodological\nlimitations. Most noticeably, although several studies had a\ncomparison group, these were often not matched or rando-\nmised,31\u201333 36 37 and contamination was commonplace.31\u201336 A\nsizeable number of the studies reported on the effects of\nconcurrent interventions,32 35 37 40 42 43 45 47 64 thereby preventing\nthe isolation of the influence of a particular intervention on the\npsychosocial work environment or health. We also had\nconcerns about the extent to which some interventions had\nbeen implemented (as noted in tables 1\u20133).53 The measures of\ndemand, control and support also varied from study to study,\nand well-validated questionnaires, such as the Karasek and\nTheorell Job Content Questionnaire,3 were seldom used. The\noutcome measures used in the studies were very varied, and\nthis means that our interpretation of the overall health effects\nof altering demand, control or support aspects of the work\nenvironment are indicative rather than definitive. Furthermore,\nonly three studies differentiated outcomes by gender or\nsocioeconomic group41 44\u201346 and so little overall insight was\ngained into how task restructuring might affect health inequal-\nities. Prospective, well-controlled studies of task structure\ninterventions that examine the impacts on the psychosocial\nwork environment, health and health inequalities, and which\nalso assess the fidelity of implementation, are therefore needed\nin the future. Studies which particularly examine the effects of\nWhat is already known on this subject\nN Observational evidence from the Whitehall and other\nstudies suggests that the psychosocial work environment\ncan affect health and health inequalities.\nN In particular, adverse health outcomes have been\nassociated with high task demand and low control,\nleading to the hypothesis that interventions that modify\nthese work characteristics may be health protective.\nPolicy implications\nN Task-restructuring interventions that increase control may\nhave positive effects on health, especially if they are\nimplemented with the demand\u2013control\u2013support model in\nmind.\nN Policy interventions such as the recently enforced EU\ndirective on participation at work \u2013 which aims to\nincrease job control and autonomy \u2013 should remain as a\npriority for public health policy.\nWhat this study adds\nN This is the first systematic review of intervention studies of\nthe health and psychosocial effects of changes to the\nwork environment brought about by task structure work\nreorganisation.\nN Change in job control, in particular, was an important\nfactor in terms of health: where interventions increased\ndemand or decreased control, health appeared to get\nworse. Very little evidence was found as to whether these\neffects differ for different socioeconomic groups.\nThe psychosocial and health effects of workplace reorganisation paper 2 1035\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \ninterventions which increase control would be the most\nuseful.54\nPolicy implications\nChange in job control emerges as the most important, and support\nas the least important, aspect of the demand\u2013control\u2013support\nmodel in terms of health. Interventions that increase control\nmay have positive effects on health, especially, if they are\nimplemented with the demand\u2013control\u2013support model in\nmind.23 The psychosocial aspects of the workplace, as well as\nmore traditional factors such as wages and hours of work, can\ntherefore be important targets for health improvement: policy\ninterventions, such as the recently enforced EU directive on\nparticipation at work,55 which aims to increase job control and\nautonomy, should therefore remain as a priority for public\nhealth policy.2\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors would like to acknowledge Nessa Barry, Val Hamilton,\nMary Robins, and Hilary Thomson who assisted with the early stages of\nthe electronic searches.
